b'Computer Technology\n\nSIMULATION ACCELERATOR\nThere is performing...then there is outperforming.\nIn this category is EAI Simulation Associates, Inc. of\nWest Long Beach, New Jersey, a design leader in supplying parallel systems for real-time high fidelity simulation.\nUnder Goddard Space Flight Center Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR) contracts, EAI Simulation\nAssociates developed a new digital simulation computer\ncalled the Advanced Real-Time (ARTS) System. Its\narchitecture is based on the analog model of computation\ninstead of the classical von Neumann model. SBIR work\nincluded development of a simulation product that\noutperforms all other computers, including supercomputers, on a wide range of continuous system\nsimulation applications. The successful completion of that\nNASA work led to the formation of the company in\n1994.\nEAI Simulation Associates has a joint marketing,\ndistribution, and maintenance agreement with Halifax\nCorporation for the commercial sale of new all-digital\nsimulation products. Among them is the SBIR-funded\ncomputer product, a data flow processor that provides\nsupercomputer performance. Five ARTS systems have\nbeen sold including over $2 million in sales to Japan. The\nproduct has been used in numbers of applications to\nsupport aerospace and automotive work, as well as in the\nelectric power and chemical reactor industry.\nThe truly innovative feature of the accelerator\nprocessor resides within the scheduling compiler. This\ncompiler does not translate code into an intermediate\nlanguage such as C or FORTRAN. Instead, it breaks\ndown source statements into threads of elementary\noperations. These operations are then automatically\nscheduled to execute directly, with maximum fine-grain\nparallelism, on very long instruction word hardware.\nMarketing of the data flow processor by Halifax is\nunderway, a product-add to that company\xe2\x80\x99s line of flight\nsimulation systems and computer simulation services to\ncivilian and military users.\nThe accelerator designed by EAI Simulation Associates is the only digital system that offers never-beforeattained computational speeds. Put to the test, a real-time\nsimulation of a Space Shuttle main engine was undertaken. Stable and accurate results were achieved, with the\nsystem simulating Space Shuttle main engine controllers,\nhigh-speed turbo pumps, and other elements. Temperatures, pressures, and flow rates were computed for fuel,\noxidizer and coolant.\n\nThis simulation was no easy task. The model required\n40 integrators, several hundred summers and multipliers,\n38 dividers, and 32 arbitrary function generators. Three\nof those generators were functions of two variables.\nThe evaluation certified that the accelerator hardware\ncan run applications \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d in real time with four processors. In a comparative test, a supercomputer took over\n250 microseconds, which was more than eight times\nslower than real time.\nA Halifax simulation system equipped with the EAI\nSimulation Associates accelerator has been designed to\nperform the functions of the analog processor in a hybrid\nsimulation. By using the accelerator, a pair of 17-foot\nracks costing over $1.5 million can be replaced with a\nsingle cabinet at about a quarter of the cost. An entire\nsimulation can be programmed in floating point in a\nsingle source language.\n\nSmall in size, powerful in computer punch. EAI Simulation Associates\ndeveloped a new computer simulation processor, yielding better-thansupercomputer performance.\n\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\n87\n\n'
