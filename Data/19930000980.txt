It is tempting\nto assign this asthenospheric channel to a ductile lower crust, as\ndiscussed above. Alternatively, an effectively stiffer mesosphere\nmay be a natural consequence of truly non-Newtonian rebound.\nMuch work remains to be done on mis problem.\nOverall, these estimates and models suggest that multiringed\nbasin formation is indeed possible at the scales observed on Venus.\nFurthermore, due to the strong inverse dependence of solid-state\nviscosity on stress, the absence of Cordilleran-style ring faulting in\ncraters smaller than Meitner or Kknova makes sense. The (1) apparent increase in viscosity of shock-fluidized rock with crater\ndiameter. (2) greater interior temperatures accessed by larger.\ndeeper craters, and (3) decreased non-Newtonian viscosity associated with larger craters may conspire to make the transition with\ndiameter from peak-ring crater to Orientalc- type multiringed basin\nrather abrupt.\nReferences: [1] Alexopoulos J.

V.Mfiller-Mohr, Institute of Planetology, University of MOnster. Wilhelm-Klemm-Str.\n10, W-4400 Munster, Germany.\nkA ___ ff^./ (J\nSudbury breccias occur as discordant dike breccias within the\nfbotwall rocks of the Sudbury structure, which is regarded as the\npossible remnant of a mul tiring basin [1]. Exposures of Sudbury\nbreccias in the North Range are known up to a radial distance of\n60-80 km from the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC). The breccias\nappear more frequent within a zone of 1 0 km adjacent to the SIC and\na further zone located about 20-33 km north of the structure.\nFrom differences in the structure of the breccias, as for example\nthe size of the breccia dikes, contact relationships between breccia\nand country rock as well as between different breccia dikes, fragment content, and fabric of the ground mass, as seen in thin section,\nthe Sudbury Breccias have been classified into four different types.\nA. Early breccias with a clastic/crystalline matrix comprise\nsmall dikes ranging in size from -1 cm to max. 20cm. Characteristic\nfeatures of these breccias are sharp contacts to country rock, low\nfragment content (20-30%), local origin of fragments, and an\naphanitic, homogenous matrix, which can be related to country\nrock. Locally corrosional contacts to feldspar minerals and small\nvesicles filled with secondary minerals are observed.\nB. Polymict breccias with a clastic matrix represent the most\ncommon type of Sudbury breccia. The thickness of the dikes varies\nfrom several tens of centimeters to a few meters but can also extend\nto more than 100 m in the case of the largest known breccia dike.\nContacts with country rock are sharp or gradadonal. Fragment\ncontent (60-75%) is usually of local origin but especially in large\ndikes allochthonous fragments have been observed. Inclusions of\ntype A breccias reveal the later formation of this type of breccia. The\n\nheterogenous matrix consisting of a fine-grained rock flour displays\nnonoriented textures as well as extreme flow lines. Chemical\nanalysis substantiates at feast some mixing with allochthonous\nmaterial.\nC. Breccias with a crystalline matrix are a subordinate type of\nSudbury breccia. According to petrographical and chemical differences, three subtypes have been separated. The local origin of the\nfragments and the close chemical relationship to the country rock\npoint to an autochthonous generation probably through in situ\nfrictional processes. For two subtypes the geometry of the dikes and\nthe texture of the matrix indicates that at feast some transport of\nbreccia material has occurred. Breccias with a crystalline matrix\nhave never been observed in contact with the other types of breccias.\nD. Late breccias with a clastic matrix are believed to represent\nthe latest phase of brccciation. Two subtypes have been distinguished due to differences in the fragment content. Breccias with a\nlow fragment content show a weak lamination and sharp or gradational contacts to country rock. Inclusions of type A breccias are\nobserved. Breccias with a high fragment content are characterized\nby gradational contacts and are only known from the outermost parts\nof the structure. Fragments of these breccias are of local origin. A\npossible correlation of the relative timescale of breccia formation\nwith the phases of crater formation will be discussed.\nShock deformation features, which have been recorded within\nbreccia fragments up to a radial distance of 9 km from the SIC,\nrepresent the shock stage I of the basement rocks. Inclusions\nexhibiting a higher shock stage, such as melt particles or suevitic\nfragments, which are known from dike breccias of, e.g., the Carswell\nimpact structure, are lacking. This means that the dike breccias of\nSudbury as presently exposed are from a deeper level of the\nsubcrater basement than their counterparts of Cars well.\nReferences: [1] Stdffler et al.

Department of Applied Geology.\nIndian School of Mines, Dhanbad, India.\nThe origin of the circular structure at Lonar, India\n(19\xc2\xb0581N:76\xc2\xb03rE). described variously as cauldron, pit, hollow,\ndepression, and crater, has been a controversial subject since the\nearly nineteenth century. A history of its origin and other aspects\nfrom 1823 to 1990 are overviewed. The structure in the Deccan Trap\nBasalt is nearly circular with a breach in the northeast, 1830 m in\ndiameter, ISO m deep, with a saline lake in the crater floor.\nSince time immemorial, mythological stories prevailed to explain in some way the formation of the Lonar structure, which has\nbeen held in great veneration with several temples within and\noutside the depression. Various hypotheses proposed to understand\nits origin are critically examined and grouped into four categories\nas (1) volcanic, (2) subsidence, (3) cryptovolcanic, and (4) meteorite impact. In the past, interpretations based on geological, morphological, and structural data were rather subjective and dominated by\nvolcanic, subsidence, and, to some extent, cryptovolcanic explanations [ 1 ]. In 1960, experience of the Canadian craters fed Beals et al.\n[2] to first suggest the possibility of a meteorite impact origin of the\nLonar crater, and thus began a new era of meteorite impact in the\nhistory of the Indian crater.\nThe last three decades (1960 to 1990) reflect a period of great\nexcitement and activity of the Lonar crater, perhaps owing to an\nupsurge of interest in exploration of the Moon and other planets.\n\n54\n\n7992 Sudbury Conference\n\nApplication of principles of hypervelocity impact entering has\nprovided overwhelming evidence for an impact origin of the Indian\ncrater. Among others, shock metantorphic characteristics of basalt,\nimpact glasses, mineralogy, chemistry, geochemistry, and comparison with the Moon\'s rocks have clearly demonstrated its formation\nby impact of a meteorite [3-6].\nOver the yean, the origin of the Lonar structure has risen from\nvolcanism, subsidence, and cryplovolcanism to an authentic meteorite impact crater. Lonar is unique because it is probably the only\nterrestrial crater in basalt and is the closest analog with the Moon\'s\ncraters. Some unresolved questions are suggested. The proposal\nis made that the young Lonar impact crater, which is less than\n50.000 years old, should be considered as the best crater laboratory\nanalogous to those of the Moon, be treated as a global monument,\nand preserved for scientists to comprehend more about the mysteries of nature and impact entering, which is now emerging as a\nfundamental ubiquitous geological process in the evolution of the\nplanets [7].\nReferences: [1] La louche T.

Marc D.Norman, Planetary Geosciences, Department\nof Geology and Geophysics, SOEST, University of Hawaii, Honolulu\n. USA.\nThe recent suggestion that the Sudbury Igneous Complex (SIC)\nis a fractionated impact melt [ 1 J may have profound implications for\nunderstanding the lunar crust and the magmatic history of the Moon.\nA cornerstone of much current thought on the Moon is that the\ndevelopment of the lunar crust can be traced through the lineage of\n"pristine" igneous rocks [2]. However, if rocks closely resembling\nthose from layered igneous intrusions can be produced by differentiation of a large impact melt sheet, then much of what is thought to\nbe known about the Moon may be called into question. This paper\npresents a brief evaluation of the SIC as a differentiated impact melt\nvs. endogenous igneous magma and possible implications for the\nmagmatic history of the lunar crust\nPetrologic and geochemical studies of terrestrial impact melts\nhave shown that most of these occurrences cooled quickly, creating\nhomogeneous crystalline rocks with compositions approximating\nthose of the average target stratigraphy [3,4]. Impact melts typically, but not always, have elevated concentrations of siderophile\nelements relative to the country rock, indicating meteoritic contamination [5,6,7]. Application of these studies to lunar samples has\nlead to various criteria thought to be useful for distinguishing\nprimary igneous rocks of the lunar highlands crust from the mixtures created by impact melting [2.8,9]. Among these criteria are\nmineral compositions suggesting plutonic conditions, non-KREEPy\nincompatible trace-element patterns, and low concentrations of\nmeteoritic siderophile elements. Lunar breccias and impact melts\nidentified as poly mict on petrographic grounds usually have incom-\n\npatible- and siderophile-element signatures indicating K KEEP and\nmeteoritic components, so a lack of these components may be taken\nas evidence that a sample preserves its primary igneous composition, even though its texture may have been modified by cataclasis\nor annealing.\nIf the SIC represents melt formed during the impact event that\ncreated the Sudbury Basin, then ideas of how large melt sheets\nbehave require revision. The SIC is anori tic-to-gran ophyric mass of\ncrystallized silicate liquid with mineral and chemical compositions\nbroadly consistent with closed-system fractional crystallization,\nalthough greenschist facies alteration has obscured much of the\nfine-scale record [10]. Despite the Ni and PGE (platinum-groupelement) sulfide ores in the SIC. siderophile-element abundances in\nthe silicates are comparable to those of the country rock [11]. PGE\npatterns in the ores are not chondritic, as they are in many impact\nmelts, but are highly fractionated and similar to those of terrestrial\nbasalts [12]. Osmium isotopic compositions in the ores suggest a\nsignificant component of continental crust and are difficult to\nreconcile with meteoritic contamination [11].\nA lunar sample with mineralogic and geochemical characteristics analogous to those of the SIC probably would be judged as\n"pristine," hence a primary igneous rock. If large impact events can\ncreate melt rocks with characteristics indistinguishable from those\nof layered igneous intrusions and with no detectable meteoritic\ncontamination, then any or all of the pristine lunar highland rocks\nmay not necessarily represent endogenous lunar magmatism but\nfractionated impact melts. Diverse components would still be\nrequired in the lunar crust and/or upper mantle to produce the\nimpressive array of lunar highland rock types, but the connection to\nmajor mantle reservoirs that could constrain the planet\'s bulk\ncomposition would be lost There may be economic implications as\nwell: If the SIC is a fractionated impact melt, then large impact\nstructures become potential exploration targets, both terrestrial and\nextraterrestrial.\nDespite the somewhat unusual, silica-rich bulk composition of\nthe SIC, several characteristics of the complex appear more consistent with endogenous magmatic processes vs. impact melting and in\nsitu differentiation. Among these characteristics are (1) petrologic\nand geophysical evidence suggesting an unexposed mafic or ultramafic mass beneath the SIC, (2) contact relations within the SIC that\nsuggest multiple intrusive events, and (3) possibly abundant water\nin the SIC magma. In addition, we argue that the silica-rich\ncomposition of the SIC does not require impact melting, but can be\naccounted for by endogenous magmatic processes although the\nimpact event may have influenced the course of the magmatic\nevolution. These topics are discussed in more detail below.\nPetrologic and geophysical evidence favoring an unexposed\nmafic or ultramafic mass beneath the SIC includes ultramafic\nxenoliths found in the SIC sublayer [13,14] and gravity and magnetic data [15]. The xenoliths have mineral and trace-element\ncompositions suggesting a petrogenetic connection to the SIC. A\nbasal ultramafic zone would suggest that the SIC is not contained\nentirely within the impact structure and would create a bulk composition for the SIC unlike that of the proposed target stratigraphy. It\nwould also seem to require a mantle-derived component in the SIC\nmagma, which may be more supportive of an endogenous magmatic\norigin rather than incorporation of mantle material into the impact\nmelt. If the excavation cavity of the Sudbury impact event was\n100-150 km diameter [1], the depth of excavation was probably\n<20 km [ 16], which would be predominantly or exclusively within\nthe continental crust.\n\n'
