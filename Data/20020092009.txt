b'Engines\n\nfor the Cosmos\n\nGalactic forces spiral across the cosmos fueled by nuclear fission and fusion and\natoms in plasmatic states with throes of constraints of gravitational forces and magnetic\nfields. In their wanderings these galaxies spew light, radiation, atomic and subatomic\nparticles throughout the universe. Throughout the ages of man visions of journeying\nthrough the stars have been wondered. If humans and human devices from Earth are to go\nbeyond the Moon and journey into deep space, it must be accomplished with like forces\nof the cosmos such as electrical fields, magnetic fields, ions, electrons and energies\ngenerated from the manipulation of subatomic and atomic particles. Forms of\nelectromagnetic waves such as light, radio waves and lasers must control deep space\nengines. We won\'t get far on our Earth accustomed hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nDeep Space Propulsion\nRocket propulsion to explore deep space is different than launch propulsion on\nEarth. On Earth high thrust is required to escape Earth\'s gravitation pull. Vehicles in deep\nspace are only faintly affected by Earth\'s gravity. Consequently, high thrust engines are\nnot required. To explore the outer planets in a reasonable time, cosmos engines must\ngenerate either high exhaust velocity or high specific impulse (Isp). Specific impulse is a\nmeasure in seconds of propulsion system efficiency in converting fuel energy into\nmomentum. Chemical propulsion can provide high thrust but is limited in the specific\nimpulse (<500sec). This is because chemical propellants carry all of the energy that can\nbe generated within the chemical composition of the propellant and there is a\nfundamental limit this energy and consequently to the specific impulse generated. To\nachieve higher specific impulses we must look to other energy sources including fission\nand fusion. With the very high energies from these sources perhaps sub atomic particles\nof light gases can be manipulated to efficiently generate low thrust energy using electron\nguns, electrical fields, magnetic fields, electric currents, lasers, radio waves and\ncombinations thereof.\nThis was known by some early 20th century chemical rocketeers. In 1947 Wernher\nvon Braun asked Ernst Stuhlinger to research Herman Oberth\'s concept of electric\npropulsion as written in his book, \'_Possibilities of Space Flight", published in 1939 in\nBerlin. As Stuhlinger recalls, yon Braun said \'_I wouldn\'t be a bit surprised if we flew to\nMars electrically". Stuldinger immerged himself in studying electric propulsion\npossibilities and in 1955 presented a paper to the International Astronautical Congress in\nVienna entitled, "Possibilities of Electrical Space Ship Propulsion". In 1952 yon Braun\npresented his first plan for a journey to Mars. This plan using chemical propulsion\nrequired 5,320,000 metric tons of fuel for 10 spaceships and the assemblage of 37,200\ntons in Earth orbit. Stuhlinger\'s plan for a Mars journey with electric propulsion required\nputting only 2,788 tons into Earth orbit. Von Braun then (1952) wrote "The small thrust\n(from electric propulsion) is effective for missions to the more distant parts of the solar\nsystem".\nStuldinger immerged himself in the development of electric ion propulsion\ndevelopment. On September 27, 1961, Stuhlinger and Hughes gesearch technicians\n\nworking under a NASA Marshall Space Flight Center contract, demonstrated the\noperation of a low-thrust (0.1 lb.), high specific impulse ion propulsion engine in a\nvacuum chamber simulating outer space. This was the first firing of a non-chemical\nrocket of the order that is destined to take man beyond the Moon and into deep space. By\n1962 the nuclear-electric\npropulsion research work at Marshall Space Flight Center was\ntransferred to NASA\'s Lewis Center as the Marshall Center focused on the mission of\ndeveloping the Saturn rockets that would overtake Soviet space superiority and land\nAmericans on the Moon.\nIn June 1996 a prototype xenon ion engine built at Lewis began long-duration\ntests in a vacuum chamber at JPL and recorded more than 8,000 hours of operation. On\nOctober 24, 1998, Deep Spacel was launched, the first spacecraft to reach another\nplanetary body.\nIon Propulsion\nIn electric ion propulsion systems, the electric energy is deposited into the\npropellant flowing into the engine. Whereas chemical propulsion systems use heat to\neject combusting propellants, ion propulsion systems have an electrical field that ejects\npropellant ions into space thereby transferring momentum to the spacecraft. Cesium or\nxenon gas is injected with ions from an electron gun. The electric field from the voltage\non a pair of metal grids extracts the charged ions and expels them into space. A cathode\nlocated toward the end of the engine injects electrons into the charged exhaust so that the\nspacecraf_ body does not build up a negative charge. The ion drive is powered by solar\npanels but could be powered by a nuclear reactor for more powerful and deeper space\nmissions. The electrical grids physically limit the flow of the ion beam and therefore the\npower generated.\nIn the Deep Space 1 ion engine electrons are emitted from a hollow tube cathode\nand enter a magnetic-tinged\nchamber where they strike xenon atoms. This impact knocks\naway a xenon electron causing the xenon to become ionized. As the ionized gas flows to\nthe rear of the engine, it encounters a 1,280-volt electrical field from a pair of metal grids\nthat forces the xenon ions to shoot from the engine body at speeds of 100,000 km/h\n(60,000 mph). This engine develops 1/50 th of a pound of thrust, much less than chemical\nrockets but with it\'s high specific impulse (a measure of propulsion energy output per\nfuel mass) it can journey in space for years.\n\nIon thrusters emit beams of positive ions and have high Isp values. Ion thrusters are still\npowering the Deep Space 1 probe.\n\nHall-Effect\n\nThrusters\n\n- Russian Space Engines\n\nThe Russians\nsatellites\n\nhave\n\nsince the early\n\nelectric\n\nbuilt Hall-effect\n\n1970s.\n\nthrusters\n\nThe Russian\n\nfield that ejects high temperature\n\nnot created\nchamber\n\nby electrical\n\nand flown them on more than 100\n\nHall-effect\n\ncharged\n\ngrids but by a ring of magnets\n\nwith a magnetic\n\ncore rod running\n\nthruster\n\nxenon\n\naxially\n\nengines\n\ngas particles.\n\nalso have an\nThe electric\n\naround the perimeter\n\ndown the center\n\nfield is\n\nof the\n\nso as to generate\n\na\n\nradial magnetic\nfield.

To learn more about ourselves\nand our\nrole in the universe,\nwe must go deep into the cosmos. For to provide clean abundant\nenergy for life on Earth we must engineer the use of the energy of atoms and stars for life\non Earth.
