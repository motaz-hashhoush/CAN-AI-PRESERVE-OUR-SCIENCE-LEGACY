application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/650,738,filed on Oct. 12, 2012. The subject\nmatter ofthis earlier filed application is hereby incorporated\nby reference in its entirety.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFIELD\nThe present invention relates to debris removal, and more\nparticularly, to an active debris removal vehicle (ADRV)\nconfigured to remove debris in space.\n\n15\n\nBACKGROUND\nOrbital debris in low earth orbit(LEO)is an international\nproblem that threatens the success of scheduled missions\nand future space ventures. For example, damage from manmade orbital debris is one ofthe top risks to LEO spaceflight\nmissions. This risk will continue to increase as access to\nspace increases, making orbital debris a global problem that\nis in need of remediation. Studies have shown that large\ndebris objects are the creation engine for great amounts of\nsmaller, hazardous debris. Thus, an apparatus and method\nfor removal of large, medium, and/or small debris objects\nmay be beneficial to reduce the threat at its source.\nSUMMARY\nCertain embodiments of the present invention may provide solutions to the problems and needs in the art that have\nnot yet been fully identified or appreciated. For example, an\nADRV (hereinafter "vehicle") may be configured to\napproach a target debris object (hereinafter "target\'), assess\nthe characteristics and motion of the target, determine an\ninitial capture trajectory, match the rates of the target,\nexecute a capture maneuver and control sequence on the\ntarget, capture and deorbit the target.\nIn one embodiment, an apparatus includes a spacecraft\ncontrol unit configured to guide and navigate the apparatus\nto a target. The apparatus also includes a dynamic object\ncharacterization unit configured to characterize movement,\nand a capture feature, of the target. The apparatus further\nincludes a capture and release unit configured to capture the\ntarget and release the target.\nIn another embodiment ofthe present invention, a method\nis provided. The method includes performing, by an apparatus, a rendezvous procedure with a target. The method also\nincludes analyzing, by the apparatus, the target prior to\ncapturing the target. The method further includes capturing,\nby the apparatus, the target based on the analysis of the\ntarget.\nIn yet another embodiment of the present invention, a\nsystem is provided. The system includes a plurality of\nvehicles. Each vehicle includes a cowcatcher configured to\nprotect instruments and react launch loads on the vehicle.\nThe system also includes a launch vehicle.

The NFIR system is\nsimilar to the noise radar system, and acts as a verification\nsystem to determine the location of the nozzle of the target.\nSee, for example, FIG. 17.\nVehicle 300 may also include a plurality of airbags 342.\nBecause vehicle 300 may enter the nozzle of the target at an\nangle, airbags 342 are configured to deploy or inflate inside\nthe nozzle of the target to center vehicle 300. In certain\nembodiments, airbags 342 may not be utilized depending on\nthe conical shape or configuration of the cowcatcher. For\nexample, depending on the shape of the cowcatcher, vehicle\n300 may automatically center inside the nozzle of the target\nduring the capture sequence.\nIt should be appreciated that the spherical tanks (first tank\n312 and second tank 314)hold the fuel and oxidizer, and are\ngenerally the largest and heaviest components of vehicle\n300. The spherical tanks, using a combination of their\nphysical design and internal pressurization, form the structural backbone of vehicle 300. The other large structural\ncomponent ofthe vehicle is the"cowcatcher" structure at the\nfront ofthe vehicle. A smaller structure 306 exists at the rear\nof vehicle 300 to mount the avionics and propulsion compartment to the rear of the second tank 314.\nThe propellant mass fraction of vehicle 300, the ratio of\nthe mass of propellant to the mass of vehicle 300, may range\nbetween 0.6 and 0.65. This means that the mass of vehicle\n300 may be more than 60% fuel. Both tanks 312, 314 may\nbe held together with a cylindrical ring (not shown) structurally fastened between tanks 312, 314. The valves, regulators, and plumbing route within this volume and out to the\nmain propulsion system and reaction control system. The\ntwo helium spheres and two batteries can be mounted to this\nring, near the geometric center of the spacecraft.\nIt should be appreciated that vehicle 300 may be equipped\nwith two helium tanks 318 and two batteries 316. The\ncapacity of each helium tank 318 or battery 316 is designed\nto be half of that required to perform the mission. This may\nallow vehicle 300 to safely perform a self-deorbit maneuver\nif one of helium tanks 318 were to leak, if one of batteries\n316 were to fail, or a combination thereof.\nVehicle 300 may also include a solar array 320 to collect\npower, and to shield propellant tanks 312, 314 from the sun.\nWhen vehicle 300 enters the nozzle of the target, solar array\n320 may be folded and turned to an off state, as shown in\nFIG. 3A. When solar array 320 is folded and turned to an off\nstate, vehicle 300 is operated using the power from batteries\n316. However, when vehicle 300 is deployed from the\nlaunch vehicle and up to rendezvous with the target, solar\narray 320 may be expanded as shown in FIG. 3B to power\nvehicle 300.\nAt the rear of vehicle 300, structure 306 includes a star\ntracker, power distribution unit, avionics, communication\nand global positioning system (GPS) unit, video antennas,\nand any other mechanism that would be appreciated by a\nperson ofordinary skill in the art. The flat panels on structure\n306 serves as radiators for vehicle 300.\nStar tracker optics assembly 308 may allow a navigation\nbase of a bus inertial measurement unit (IMU) to be periodically updated due to drift by comparing and correcting\noffsets in the observed and expected star field positions.\nVehicle 300 may also include at least two S-band telemetry/\ncommunication antennas 310 configured to assist vehicle\n300 with command and telemetry. For example, telemetry\n\nand communications antennas 310 may monitor and update\nthe attitude of vehicle 300 and transmit the monitored and\nupdated attitude of vehicle 300 to ground control. A colocated GPS navigation antenna may also be used to assist\nwith orbit navigation and maneuver planning.\nBi-propellant propulsion engine 302 is attached to the rear\nof vehicle 300 and is configured to propel vehicle 300\nforward through, for example, space. Vehicle 300 may also\nbe equipped with at least four bi-propellant units 304 to turn\nvehicle 300. There may be two bi-propellant units 304 at the\nfront of vehicle 300, and two bi-propellant units 304 at the\nrear of vehicle 300.\nFIGS. 4A-4C illustrate clustering 400 of a plurality of\nvehicles 410 on a payload 405 ofa launch vehicle, according\nto an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the launch vehicle may include a payload 405 configured to hold any number of vehicles. For example, FIGS.\n4A through 4C show that a payload 405 may include three,\nfour, or eight vehicles 410.\nIt should be appreciated that any configuration and number of vehicles 410 can be placed on payload 405 of the\nlaunch vehicle. The configuration and number of vehicles\n410 placed in payload 405 may depend on the type oflaunch\nvehicle used. For example, a launch vehicle such as Antares\nmay include eight vehicles 410 in its payload 405, as shown\nin FIG. 4C. Athena-II, for example, may include four\nvehicles 410 in its payload 405. See FIG. 4B. In certain\nembodiments, the practical upper limit of the number of\nvehicles 410 operated simultaneously may be eight, and any\nsuccessful debris removal campaign may perform at least\nfive (5) disposals per year.\nIn other embodiments, smaller launch vehicles, such as\nPegasus and Minotaur 1, may be used when launching a\nsingle vehicle. It should be appreciated that when launching\nmore than one vehicle, the cost to launch a smaller launch\nvehicle may be greater than using a larger launch vehicle\nthat can hold a larger number of vehicles in its payload.\nHowever, using extremely large vehicles, such as Falcon 9\nor Atlas V, may not be beneficial because such a launch\nvehicle may be too large to fully utilize for the purpose of\nthe mission. Thus, depending on the mission requirements\nand the number of vehicles that are to be utilized, launch\nvehicles of different sizes can be used to carry out the\nmission of capturing targets in space.\nThe following description related to FIGS. 5-10 details\nthe vehicle subsystems that allow the vehicle to safely\nrendezvous, capture, and deorbit the target in some embodiments. FIG. 5,for example, illustrates a block diagram of an\nelectrical power system 500 of the vehicle, according to an\nembodiment of the present invention. Electrical power system 500 may include a solar array 505, a solar array\ncontroller 510, and two batteries 515. Solar array 505 may\nbe configured to capture the energy from the sunlight, while\narray controller 510 may control the amount of energy that\nis provided from solar array 505 to drive the vehicle.\nBatteries 515 may be configured to provide power or energy\nto the vehicle during the rendezvous and capture sequence,\nas well as the deorbit process of the target.\nIt should be appreciated that electrical power system 500\nmay operate in three phases (1) operations in daylight,(2)\noperations in darkness, and (3) operations during the debris\ndisposal. For example, during operations in daylight, solar\narray 505 may fully charge batteries 515. As shown in FIGS.\n3A and 313, the solar array may be fixed to the top of the\npropellant tanks and equipped with folding outboard panels,\nwhich allows for more compact packaging during the launch\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nUS 9,555,905 B2\n13\n\n14\n\nof the vehicle.

The\nvarious sensing phases could be described as during rendezvous, during proximity operations and capture, and during the post-capture timeframe, with target range as the 5\nindependent variable to determine the optimum sensor for a\nparticular task. Beyond a range of approximately 100 km to\nthe target, the guidance, navigation and control (GN&C)\nsensing tasks may be conventional with other rendezvous\noperations, i.e. star trackers,IMU,and GPS sensors included io\nas part of the core spacecraft functions are generally dominant.\nThe first mission sensor applied to the rendezvous is the\nIR camera. With an expected effective range of at least 100\nkm, this sensor provides bearing data and offers sufficient 15\nresolution to functionally backup the star tracker. The IR\ncamera may be augmented by the visible light camera\nintermittently at a range of 15 km,but more continuously at\na range of 1 km for target bearing. Also at a range of\napproximately 1 km,the LIDAR sensor if incorporated may 20\nbecome an effective means for both range and bearing.\nAt a range of 100 m from the target, the phase changes\nfrom rendezvous to proximity operations and capture. This\nis critical because it marks the changeover from travelling to\nthe target to actually capturing the target. As range is slowly 25\ndecreased from 100 m to 8-12 m,the tumble attitude, plane,\ncenter ofrotation, and period ofrotation may be added to the\nrange, range rate, and bearing that were all previously\ncollected. At 8-12 m, the vehicle parks itself on the V-bar\nand performs its final assessment using all of the above 30\nsensors, including the addition of the noise radar to fully\ncharacterize the target motion, the overall target state, and\nthe planning of the burn sequence to capture the target. A\nportion of the planning involves the timeline post capture to\nthe next series of available deorbit opportunities.\n35\nThis may be important for several reasons. First, it is wise\nto have more than one consecutive deorbit opportunity in\norder to protect for an underburn or reaction control system\ndeorbit. Secondly, prior to initiating the capture sequence,\nsufficient battery life is required so that the solar array can 40\nbe retracted and bypassed. The solar array may not be\neffective once enclosed within the nozzle of the target.\nSimilarly, orbital lighting and favorable coverage over\nground stations are timeline considerations that the mission\nplanner function will consider before sending the plan to the 45\nmission manager.\nIt should be appreciated that ground control may also be\nable to monitor the mission execution by the vehicle in\nparallel. This may allow ground control to halt any mission\nif for example, a system failure is detected or the nozzle of 50\nthe target is not approachable.\nOnce the target has been characterized by the sensors, a\ncomparison can be made to the computed trajectory and\nburn plan to a preflight prediction. When the timeline\nconditions are satisfied, spacecraft computer 1020 may 55\ncommand the spiral capture sequence. The execution of\nthese maneuvers may be performed in two phases. First, the\nvehicle can maneuver into the capture the plane of tumbling\nrotation of the target. Once this maneuver has been verified,\nthe vehicle can accelerate to match the rotation rate of the 60\ntarget.\nOnce the target is captured, the post-capture phase, i.e.,\nthe second phase, commences. In this phase, the vehicle can\nre-enable attitude control and begin a series of characterization burns using the rear reaction control system thrust- 65\ners. These burns assess the response ofthe combined vehicle\nto known impulse events, allowing the SCS to estimate the\n\n20\nmass properties ofthe combined vehicle for a stable de-orbit\nburn. The sensors available to the guidance system in this\ntimeframe are the IMU and accelerometers, although the\nGPS antenna and star tracker on the rear of the vehicle\nremain viable for orbital navigation.\nThe characterization system may also be used during\ndeorbit, when spacecraft computer 1020 functions as a\nbackup to the vehicle computer for targeting the deorbit\nmaneuvers. This allows for disposal to continue in the event\nof a software module malfunction in the vehicle computer.\nFIG. 11 illustrations a block diagram 1100 of the subsystem components of the ADRV, according to an embodiment\nof the present invention. The vehicle data processing and\ncommand and data handling duties can be functionally split\nbetween mission data handling and spacecraft systems data\nhandling. This split differentiates the functions for the debris\nmission (mission data handling) and the functions for routine duties for spacecraft systems. This split allows the bulk\nofthe spacecraft bus to be constructed from commercial line\nreplacement units, simplifying the design, development,\ntest, and evaluation ofthe overall system and contributing to\nsimplified long-term vehicle production.\nComponents core to the routine duties of the vehicle\ninclude, but are not limited to, vehicle computer 1102, a\ntracking and data relay satellite (TDRS) transceiver 1104,\nglobal positioning system receiver 1106, thermostat 1108,\npropellant pressure, volume, and temperature (PVT) controller 1110, solar array (SA)charge controller 1112, batteries 1114, 1116, spacecraft bus regulator 1118, sun sensor\n1120, solar array 1122, reaction jet driver 1124, momentum\nwheels 1126, accelerometers 1128, star tracker 1130, and\nIMU 1132. Components indigenous to the debris mission\ninclude, but are not limited to, spacecraft control (SCS)\ncomputer 1152, DOCS LIDAR 1154, noise radar 1156,\nDOCS camera 1158, an ultra-high frequency video transmitter 1160, infrared camera 1162, and CARS 1164.\nFor the routine duties of the vehicle, spacecraft bus\nregulator 1118 is configured to regulate voltage to the solar\narray 1122. For example, SA charge controller 1112 may\nactivate solar array 1122 when sun sensor 1120 detects\nsunlight. This allows the vehicle to conserve the energy\nstored in batteries 1114, 1116, and rely mostly on solar\npower. The power collected from solar array 1122 can be\nused by SA charge controller 1112 to drive vehicle computer\n1102, as well as other components on the vehicle.\nVehicle computer 1102 may be a central processor and an\ninterface between other vehicle components and ground\ncontrol (not shown). Vehicle computer 1102 may include a\nmaster timing source for the vehicle, and may be configured\nto assemble and route telemetry data. Vehicle computer 1102\nmay also provide memory for data and video storage prior\nto downlink, and issue commands generated either from its\nown system software module, spacecraft control system\ncomputer 1152, or received from ground control.\nVehicle computer 1102 may also control heater cycling\nusing thermostat 1108, and perform propellant PVT management using PVT controller 1110. Vehicle computer 1102\nmay further control the charge and discharge rates on the\nelectrical power bus via SA charge controller 1112. Vehicle\ncomputer 1102 further performs guidance and control functions by assimilating data from star tracker 1130, GPS\nreceiver 1106, and IMU 1132. Vehicle computer 1102 may\nalso perform basic trajectory planning functions in certain\nembodiments.\nThe processor of vehicle computer 1102 communicates\nthrough a TDRS network via TDRS transceiver 1104 and\ntwo hemispherical antennas Al, A2 located on a compart-\n\nUS 9,555,905 B2\n21\n\nOW\n\nment at the rear of the vehicle.
