b'Books & Reports\nDust Mitigation Vehicle\nA document describes the development and demonstration of an apparatus, called a \xe2\x80\x9cdust mitigation vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d\nfor reducing the amount of free dust on\nthe surface of the Moon. The dust mitigation vehicle would be used to pave surfaces on the Moon to prevent the dust\nfrom levitating or adhering to surfaces.\nThe basic principle of operation of\nthese apparatuses is to use a lens or a\ndish mirror to concentrate solar thermal\nradiation onto a small spot to heat lunar\nregolith. In the case of the prototype\ndust mitigation vehicle, a Fresnel lens\nwas used to heat a surface layer of regolith sufficiently to sinter or melt dust\ngrains into a solid mass. The prototype\nvehicle has demonstrated paving rates\nup to 1.8 m2 per day. The proposed\nflight design of the dust mitigation vehicle is also described.\nThis work was done by Eric H. Cardiff of Goddard Space Flight Center. Further information\nis contained in a TSP (see page 1). GSC15488-1\n\nOptical Coating Performance for Heat Reflectors of\nthe JWST-ISIM Electronic\nComponent\nA document discusses a thermal radiator design consisting of lightweight composite materials and low-emittance\nmetal coatings for use on the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) structure. The structure will have a Thermal\nSubsystem unit to provide passive cooling to the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) control electronics. The ISIM, in the JWST observatory,\nis the platform that provides the mounting surfaces for the instrument control\nelectronics. Dissipating the control electronic generated-heat away from JWST is\nof paramount importance so that the\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s own heat does not interfere\nwith the infrared-light gathering of distant cosmic sources.\nThe need to have lateral control in\nthe emission direction of the IEC (ISIM\nElectronics Compartment) radiators led\nto the development of a directional baffle design that uses multiple curved mirrorlike surfaces. This concept started\nout from the so-called Winston non-im-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2011\n\naging optical concentrators that use opposing parabolic reflector surfaces,\nwhere each parabola has its focus at the\nopposite edge of the exit aperture. For\nthis reason they are often known as compound parabolic concentrators or CPCs.\nThis radiator system with the circular\nsection was chosen for the IEC reflectors\nbecause it offers two advantages over\nother designs. The first is that the area\nof the reflector strips for a given radiator\narea is less, which results in a lower mass\nbaffle assembly. Secondly, the fraction of\nenergy emitted by the radiator strips and\nsubsequently reflected by the baffle is\nless. These fewer reflections reduced the\namount of energy that is absorbed and\neventually re-emitted, typically in a direction outside the design emission\nrange angle.\nA baffle frame holds the mirrors in position above a radiator panel on the IEC.\nTogether, these will direct the majority\nof the heat from the IEC above the sunshield away towards empty space.\nThis work was done by Robert A. Rashford,\nCharles M. Perrygo, Matthew B. Garrison,\nBryant K. White, Felix T. Threat, Manuel A.\nQuijada, James W. Jeans, Frank K. Huber,\nRobert R. Bousquet, and Dave Shaw of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1). GSC15823-1\n\nSpaceCube Demonstration\nPlatform\nA document discusses how the HST SM4\nSpaceCube flight spare was modified to\ncreate an experiment called the SpaceCube Demonstration Platform (SC DP) for\nuse on the MISSE7 Space Station payload\n(in collaboration with NRL). It is designed\nto serve as an on-orbit platform for demonstrating advanced fault tolerance technologies. A simple C&DH (command and data\nhandling) system was developed for the\nVirtex4 FPGAs (field programmable gate\narrays). Both Virtex4s on each SpaceCube\nrun the same program, and both receive\nincoming telemetry. The rad-hard service\nFPGA performs simple error checking to\nverify that the incoming telemetry is valid.\nThe SpaceCube framework was modified\nto allow for new program files to be sent\nfrom the ground, to be stored on the\nSpaceCube, and to be executed through\nground commands. Each SpaceCube Vir-\n\ntex4 FPGA has resources set aside for experiments that are functionally isolated\nfrom the C&DH system. The experiments\ncommunicate to the C&DH system\nthrough a set of dual port memories, and\nthis area is where the fault-tolerance experiments are executed.\nWith the use of Xilinx commercial\nVirtex4 FX60 FPGAs, the fault tolerant\nframework allows the system to recover\nfrom radiation upsets that occur in the\nrad-soft parts (Virtex4 FPGA logic, embedded PPCs in Virtex4 FPGAs, SDRAM\nand Flash), the C&DH system that runs\nsimultaneously on both Virtex4 FPGAs\nthat uses a robust telemetry packet structure, checksums, and the rad-hard service FPGA to validate incoming telemetry.\nThe ability to be reconfigured from the\nground while in orbit is a novel benefit,\nas well as is the onboard compression capabilities that allow compressed files\nfrom the ground to be uploaded to the\nSpaceCube.\nThis work was done by Daniel Espinosa, Jeffrey Hosler, Alessandro Geist, David Petrick,\nManuel Buenfil, Gary Crum, and Tom Flatley for Goddard Space Flight Center.

GSC-15953-1\n\nAperture Mask for\nUnambiguous Parity\nDetermination in Long\nWavelength Imagers\nA document discusses a new parity\npupil mask design that allows users to\nunambiguously determine the image\nspace coordinate system of all the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) science\ninstruments by using two out-of-focus\nimages. This is an improvement over existing mask designs that could not completely eliminate the coordinate system\nparity ambiguity at a wavelength of 5.6\nmicrons. To mitigate the problem of\nhow the presence of diffraction artifacts\ncan obscure the pupil mask detail, this\ninnovation has been created with specifically designed edge features so that the\nimage space coordinate system parity\ncan be determined in the presence of\ndiffraction, even at long wavelengths.\nThis work was done by Brent Bos for Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.
