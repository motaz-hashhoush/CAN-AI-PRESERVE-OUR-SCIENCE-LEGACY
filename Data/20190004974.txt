This highly mass- and\nvolume-constrained satellite will demonstrate several technologies for NASA, including the use of\n\xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d propellant, the ability for a CubeSat-sized satellite to perform science measurements\nbeyond low Earth orbit, and the first planetary mission to use multi-band active reflectometry from\norbit. Lunar Flashlight will detect and map water ice in permanently shadowed regions of the lunar\nsouth pole by measuring surface reflectance at multiple wavelengths. Mapping and quantifying\nlunar water ice addresses one of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Strategic Knowledge Gaps to understand the lunar\nresource potential for future human exploration of the Moon.\n\nIndex Terms: To be determined\n\nIntroduction\nRecent reflectance data from LRO instruments suggest water ice and other volatiles may be\npresent on the surface in lunar permanently-shadowed regions, though the detection is not yet\ndefinitive. Understanding the composition, quantity, distribution, and form of water and other\nvolatiles associated with lunar permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) is identified as a Strategic\nKnowledge Gap (SKG) for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s human exploration program, projected to visit the lunar south\npole in the next decade. These polar volatile deposits are also scientifically interesting, having\npotential to reveal important information about the delivery of water to the Earth-Moon system.\n\nLunar Flashlight is a very small satellite (6U bus, or 12\xef\x82\xb424\xef\x82\xb436 cm) managed by the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory that will determine the presence or absence of exposed water ice and map\nits distribution within the PSRs at the lunar south pole. Lunar Flashlight was selected in 2014 by\nthe NASA Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program within the Human Exploration and\nOperations Mission Directorate (HEOMD); the mission is currently funded as a technology\ndemonstration mission within NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Technology Mission Directorate portfolio. Lunar\nFlashlight will be one of 13 secondary payloads launched on the first test flight (EM-1) of the Space\nLaunch System (SLS), currently scheduled for 2020. After being ejected by SLS, Lunar Flashlight\nuses \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d propellant to maneuver into a low-energy transfer to lunar orbit and achieve a perilune\nof 10-30 km above the south pole for data collection. The Lunar Flashlight mission is will\ndemonstrate technologies for NASA such as green propulsion and active laser spectroscopy while\nproving the capability of performing a planetary science investigation in the cubsat form factor.\n\nScience and Payload\nWater on the Moon is both a record of science and a resource for exploration. Volatile\ncompounds are fundamental tracers of a planetary body\xe2\x80\x99s origin, evolution, and interaction with its\nspace environment. The observed abundance and chemical inventory of condensed volatiles may\nalso reveal a history of dynamical exchange among different regions of the Solar System. Near the\npoles of the Moon, large areas of perennial (or \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent\xe2\x80\x9d) shadow create cold traps, where\nvolatiles would be thermally stable for billions of years. Permanently shadowed regions (PSRs)\nmay therefore hold a record of volatile delivery, transport, sequestration, and loss through geologic\ntime [1, 2]. In addition, water could be an important target of in situ resource utilization (ISRU),\nwhere O2 and H2O for life support or H2 and O2 for fuel and propellant could be derived from\ndeposits of water ice [3-5].\nLunar polar water ice consists of two reservoirs: deeply buried ice deposits, and surface water\nfrost. The Clementine, Lunar Prospector, and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions made\n\nobservations consistent with ice deposits cm- to meters-deep in PSRs with concentrations ~1%\nH2O by mass [6-9], but not all PSRs contain water ice signatures. The Lunar CRater Observation\nand Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission excavated and heated 10\xe2\x80\x99s of m of regolith, revealing 57 wt% of H2O along with a comet-like array of volatiles [10]. At the lunar surface, spectroscopic\nand albedo measurements from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Moon Mineralogy Mapper\nshow surface reflectance properties consistent with water frost at concentrations ranging from ~0.1\nup to ~10 wt% in the south polar PSRs, with a patchy distribution [11-13]. However, the\ndistribution of apparent water frost at the surface does not match the subsurface distribution, and\nneither is its occurrence proven everywhere temperatures are cold enough to permit trapping of\nwater molecules [14]. Current data are not yet sufficient to conclude the form, quantity, or\ndistribution of lunar H2O at concentrations sufficient for in-situ resource utilization (IRSU), or to\npredict the distribution of ice at scales of a rover or human landed mission.\nBecause of this uncertainty, and the potential utility of water as a resource to human exploration,\nNASA identified a Strategic Knowledge Gap (SKG) for Human Exploration to understand the\ncomposition, quantity, distribution, and form of water and other volatiles associated with PSRs [15].\nThe Lunar Flashlight mission will make definitive detections of water ice within PSRs. Lunar\nFlashlight carries an active laser illumination system and a multi-band reflectometer to measure\nsurface reflectance in permanently shadowed regions at four near-IR wavelengths diagnostic of\nwater ice presence. Derived reflectance and water ice band depths will be mapped onto the lunar\nsurface in order to identify locations where H2O ice is present in concentrations above 2 wt%, at\nthe scale of ~10 km/pixel or smaller.\nThe Lunar Flashlight illumination system uses stacked laser diode bars to emit energy pulses\nat four discrete wavelengths in rapid sequence, while a receiver system detects the reflected light.\nWe optimized the laser wavelengths to distinguish water ice absorption bands from dry lunar\nregolith using two pairs of molecular absorption bands and continuum measurements (Fig. 1). The\nselected wavelengths are 1.064 (-0.060 / + 0.230) \xc2\xb5m & 1.850 (-0.030 / +0.020) \xc2\xb5m for continuum\n\nFig. 1. Lunar Flashlight uses four-point spectroscopy to distinguish dry regolith from water ice\nfrost. Two of the four wavelengths (~1.495 \xc2\xb5m and ~1.99 \xc2\xb5m) correspond to overtone\nvibrational absorption features for water ice, while the two other wavelengths (~1.064 \xc2\xb5m and\n~1.85 \xc2\xb5m) correspond to nearby continua. The measurement will ratio the reflectance value in\nthe absorption features to the continuum to determine water ice abundance.\nmeasurements and 1.495 (-0.015 / +0.015) \xc2\xb5m & 1.990 (-0.020 / +0.025) \xc2\xb5m for absorption bands.\nThe Lunar Flashlight 1.064 \xc2\xb5m laser is the same wavelength used by the LOLA instrument,\npotentially enabling a tie point of absolute surface reflectance, though at a different spatial scale.\nThe laser diodes are procured from DILAS, Inc.; the continuum bands are off-the-shelf\nprocurements and custom laser epitaxies were grown for the water band wavelengths. The diode\nlasers, supplied with 45 A current from batteries, emit 14-72 W (depending on wavelength). 99.6%\nof the emitted energy is encircled within a full-angle of 17 mrad. The receiver is an aluminum, offaxis paraboloidal mirror with a focal length of 70 mm, which collects the reflected light from the\nlunar surface onto a single-pixel InGaAs detector with a 2-mm diameter, providing a 20-mrad field\nof view. The detector temperature is cold-biased and stabilized by a heater. See [16, 17] for a more\nthorough description of the design and characterization of the Lunar Flashlight multiband\nreflectometer.\n\nIn nominal operation, the LF lasers fire sequentially for 1-6 ms each, followed by a pause of 16 ms with all lasers off. The optical receiver collects and measures the light reflected from the lunar\nsurface. The measurement with all lasers off quantifies the background, which is the sum of detector\ndark current, thermal emission from the receiver itself incident on the science detector, and solar\nillumination reflected from the lunar surface and detected by the instrument from both inside and\noutside its FOV. In order to increase the SNR, the measurements can be added along-track for each\nspectral band to create the desired mapping resolution (~10 km). The total duration of laser firing\nper pass will be approximately 2-3 minutes during the closest approach. By repeating these\nmeasurement over multiple points, Lunar Flashlight will create a map of surficial ice concentration\nthat can be correlated to previous mission data and used to guide future missions. All calibrated\ndata and derived data products will be publicly archived in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Planetary Data System (PDS).\n\nMission Design\nLunar Flashlight and the other EM-1 secondary payloads will be launched within a Secondary\nPayload Deployment System (SPDS) mounted in the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA) of the Block -1\nSLS [18]. Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems will integrate each payload into a PSC C50 dispenser and\ndeliver it for integration into the SPDS. After launch and Orion separation, the SPDS will deploy\n\npayloads at several \xe2\x80\x9cbus stops\xe2\x80\x9d along the SPDS trajectory. The SPDS will command the dispenser\ndoor to open, allowing the spring-loaded dispenser plate to push the payload into space.\nLunar Flashlight will be dispensed at the first available \xe2\x80\x9cbus stop\xe2\x80\x9d for EM-1 cubesats, at about\n36,000 km above Earth. It must maneuver via a low-energy transfer to a polar lunar orbit insertion\npoint. The spacecraft will detumble, deploy its solar panels, and make initial contact with Earth. It\nwill conduct an initial 20 km/s trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) to avoid escaping the EarthMoon system and place it on a looping trajectory around the Earth and Moon (Fig. 2). A total of\nthree loops are required to achieve polar orbit insertion with the required sun geometry. As the\n\nFigure 2. The Lunar Flashlight mission design is amazing and super great.\nspacecraft performs three distant Earth and Moon flybys, it will conduct system checkouts, laser\npower system charge and discharge tests, and instrument calibration (laser test firing and Jupiter\nobservation).\nAfter 190 days, Lunar Flashlight conducts a 10 km/s TCM to insert into a near-rectilinear halo\norbit about the Earth-Moon L2 point. The orbit has a 5-7 day polar orbit, a perilune altitude of 15\nkm, and an apolune of approximately 9000 km. The total delta-V required to achieve the mission\n\nis 140 m/s from dispensal, including statistical, gravity loss, and orbit maintenance. The science\ndata collection will take place during 10 orbits over the 2-month planned mission duration, at\naltitudes of approximately 10 to 50 km within 10\xc2\xb0 latitude of the lunar south pole. Fuel permitting,\nit may be able to make more passes; when the fuel is exhausted, the spacecraft will make a\ncontrolled crash into the Moon near the south pole.\n\nSpacecraft\nLunar Flashlight uses a standard aluminum CubeSat 6U bus primary structure and weighs\napproximately 14 kg. Building on the success of the JPL INSPIRE and MarCO satellites [19, 20],\nLunar Flashlight uses a single string design with limited fault redundancy and employs COTS\ncomponents which have been screened for use in space application alongside custom-built\nsubsytems (Fig. 3).\nPropulsion: The Lunar Flashlight Propulsion System (LFPS) responsible for placing the\nspacecraft into a polar orbit around the moon, and performing orbital maintenance throughout its\neight-month mission. The LFPS comprises an advanced, low toxicity \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d micropropulsion\nsystem (MiPS). The LFPS development is the responsibility of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight\nCenter, the MiPS is built by VACCO Industries. The VACCO Lunar Flashlight MiPS is\napproximately 3U in total volume and uses four 100 mN thrusters to provide a total of 290 m/s of\ndelta-V. The LFPS uses the monopropellant fuel LMP-103S/LT. LMP-103S is an ionic liquidbased blend based on the oxidizer ammonium dinitramide, produced by Eurenco Bofors in Sweden.\nThis propellant has higher specific impulse and higher propellant density than hydrazine, which\nresults in increased performance. The propellant is considerably less toxic, non-carcinogenic and\nsimpler to handle, ship, and store than hydrazine. This propulsion system is a first of its kind, and\nwill mark NASA\xe2\x80\x99s first mission using this propellant. The LFIPS uses four 100 mN HPGP\nThrusters developed by Bradford ECAPS specifically for use with green propellant. Each thruster\n\nFigure 3. The Lunar Flashlight spacecraft (6U, 14 kg) uses a mix of space-qualified\ncommercial and custom-built components. Components in green were developed through the\nNASA Small Business Innovation Research program.\nindependently operates to perform both delta-V and ACS maneuvers controlled by an integrated\nmicroprocessor controller.\nPower: Lunar Flashlight uses two trifold MMA High Watts per Kilogram (HaWK) deployable\nsolar arrays, two simple 2Ux3U deployable solar arrays, a battery, and an EPS card. Each solar\npanel has 21 XTJ GaAs cells. The solar panels will provide ~55 W total power at end-of-life. The\n6.2 Ah battery contains 3s2p Panasonic NCRB 18650B Li-ion cells. The total capacity of the\nbattery is 48.2Wh at launch day. The battery will be fully discharged by the laser system during\neach science pass, and recharged over the remainder of the orbit.\n\nCommunications: At the planetary distances planned for Lunar Flashlight and other EM-1\nmissions, they must use X-Band uplink and downlink (7.2 GHz and 8.4 GHz respectively).\nLunar Flashlight and other EM-1 missions will use the JPL-developed Iris radio, a radiationhardened, software defined radio based on other JPL products like the Electra Proximity Radio\nand the Universal Space Transponder. The Iris radio supports coherent turn-around which allows\nsequential ranging to be supported, and downlink data rates up to 256 kbps and uplink data rates\nof 8 kbps. The Iris radio was successfully demonstrated on the MarCO satellites [19]. Lunar\nFlashlight uses the Iris 2.1 X-Band Transponder with 4 W RF output power, supporting Doppler,\nranging, and D-DOR, and two pairs of INSPIRE-heritage low-gain antennas. Uplink commanding\nand downlink receiving will be conducted using NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Deep Space Network.\nCommand and Data Handling: The C&DH subsystem is a 1U (10 cm x 9.4 cm) single-string\narchitecture composed of a computer board to provide computation, control, storage, and\ninterfacing functions, and an interface board to provide switching, driving, data acquisition,\ninterfacing, and other functions, along with 8GB of rad-hard NAND flash memory. JPL has custom\nbuilt a radiation-tolerant, miniaturized Sphinx C&DH board. Sphinx uses a dual-core, fault-tolerant\nLEON3-FT (GR712) processor that can run onboard algorithms for ASA, DTN, and optimal\nresource planning. The LEON architecture has been proven in space, and the Sphinx board will\ngain deep-space flight heritage on both the Lunar Flashlight and NEAScout missions.\nAttitude control: Attitude control is performed with a Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT)\nintegrated attitude control unit (star tracker, reaction wheels, inertial measurement unit, control\nalgorithms). Lunar Flashlight uses a BCT XACT-50 integrated ACS unit. The XACT-50 is based\non the COTS XACT unit, work done on the MarCO mission, and additional work to meet the\nneeds of Lunar Flashlight. The ACS unit receives data from 4 coarse sun sensors and controls the\nVACCO green propulsion system.\nThermal: Thermal management challenges for the Lunar Flashlight mission include keeping\nthe laser receiver cool while dissipating heat as the lasers fire, the high-temperature propulsion\n\nsystem, and maintaining spacecraft operations in the lunar orbit environment. The Lunar Flashlight\nthermal design is overall passively cooled and actively heated. The detector operating temperature\nis maintained at or below -60 \xc2\xb0C by a space-facing radiator and isolating the optics from the chassis.\nPhase-change thermal storage will maintain a constant operational temperature for the lasers during\nthe minutes of operation during the science passes. Both the propulsion unit and the solar panels\nare thermally isolated from the main spacecraft and the solar panel edges nearest the thrusters are\ninsulated. In addition, four thermostat-controlled heaters will be available.\nFlight software: The Lunar Flashlight Flight Software (FSW) subsystem provides on-board\nspacecraft software functionalities such as commanding, telemetry, uplink, downlink, data storage,\ntime, parameters, data management, fault protection and interface management for various\nhardware components including the Iris radio, payload, EPS, XACT, propulsion unit, Sphinx and\nADCs. Lunar Flashlight FSW is developed using the F Prime framework with heritage from the\nASTERIA mission [21].\n\nSummary\nLunar Flashlight is a low-cost cubesat mission to be launched as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s first SLS test\nflight. This innovative mission will demonstrate several firsts, including being one of the first\ninstruments onboard a CubeSat performing science measurements beyond low Earth orbit, and the\nfirst planetary mission to use multi-band active reflectometry from orbit. It will demonstrate new\n100 mN thrusters using green propellant, providing nearly 25% higher performance than hydrazine\nin a low toxicity form for transport and storage. Lunar Flashlight will drive infusion of these\ntechnologies into smaller satellites and payloads for NASA.\nThe mission goals are to test new technologies and to detect and map the surface distribution\nof water ice within the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. Lunar Flashlight\xe2\x80\x99s\nfour-channel laser projector will illuminate permanently shadowed regions, measuring surface\nreflectance at wavelengths diagnostic of water ice. Water ice will be distinguished from dry regolith\n\nin two ways: 1) spatial variations in albedo, and 2) reflectance ratios between absorption and\ncontinuum channels. Water ice band depths will be mapped in order to distinguish the composition\nof the PSRs from that of the sunlit terrain. These data will be highly complementary to other lunar\ndatasets, including LRO.\nTwo other missions on the EM-1 launch (Lunar IceCube and LunaH-Map) will make\ncomplementary lunar volatile measurements [22, 23]. Although each cubesat uses a different\nmission design and measurement approach, the results from all three missions will be synergistic\nwhen viewed as a fleet of tiny missions simultaneously exploring the nature and distribution of\nwater on the Moon ahead of human exploration.\n\nAcknowledgements\nJPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages Lunar Flashlight\nfor NASA.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]\n\nM.
