When an object is compressed between\nthe jaws of the vise, the segments in the cluster are\nmoved into positions which accommodate irregularities; thus, the notches of a number of segments are\nbrought into contact with the object. With ordinary\nvee-jaw vises, each jaw seldom will make contact\nwith more than two spots on an irregular object; in\ncontrast, a jaw with notched segmented sections\nmakes contact at many points and, since each contact\npoint is a source of friction, irregular objects are held\nsecurely.\n\nNote:\n\nThe solution:\nA vise with a stationary vee-shaped jaw and a segmented notched jaw.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe vise is constructed as shown in the diagram.\nThe jaw which is attached to the screw has a deep\n45\xc2\xb0 notch, and it is gibbed loosely; additionally, to\npermit adaptation to irregular objects, the screw is\nfabricated slightly smaller than the tapped hole in\nthe body of the vise. The other jaw, which ordinarily\nis completely immobile in vises, has a face made up\nof a cluster of 45-degree-notched segments of hardened steel. The cluster of segments is snugly pinned\nto the vise body with a hardened dowel placed in\n\nNo additional documentation is available.
