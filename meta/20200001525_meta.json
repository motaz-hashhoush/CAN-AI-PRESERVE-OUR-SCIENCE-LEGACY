No single chemical composition, surface pressure, or temperature was typical. After the biggest impacts the temperature likely rose above 3000 K and the atmosphere held rock vapor. As the atmosphere cooled its constituents rained out: first the silicates, then the geochemical volatiles (such as salt), and last the water. Depending on the size of the impact, cooling took thousands to millions of years. Between impacts the atmosphere was thick with gases like CO2, H2, and CH4 that do not condense at Earth but provide greenhouse warming that could easily have maintained surface temperatures in excess of 500 K. At some point the early atmosphere must have been conducive to the evolution of organic chemistry and the origin of life. It was therefore --- at times --- dominated by reduced gases like hydrogen and methane. Hydrogen-methane atmospheres are easily formed thermochemically after major impacts if H2O and CO2 were present on Earth in quantities consistent with their inventories on Earth today \u2013 the key is high pressure. Hydrogen-methane atmospheres slowly break down over millions of years by hydrogen escape and photochemistry. At first methane decomposes into tars and nitriles that precipitate, but later as the atmosphere grows more oxidized from hydrogen escape the methane oxidizes to CO and CO2, with a small fraction going to HCN. Impacts can also produce NH3 directly from N2 and H2O, which is expected to rain out with the H2O. As impacts grew infrequent the climate cooled in response to the fixing of CO2 as carbonate and carbonate subduction. Eventually the CO2 was mostly removed to the mantle and the surface mostly frozen.
