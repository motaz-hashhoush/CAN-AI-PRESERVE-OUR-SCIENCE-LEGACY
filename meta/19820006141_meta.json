Three passbands recorded very similar head plus tail structure. The fourth passband shows an additional large, diffuse component around the head. It was serendipitous that such was recorded as the filters, being selected for studies of emission nebulae, are not particularly suited for studies of comets. However the imagery, plus subsequent studies, suggests that much can be learned about the structure of comets using narrow passband imagery simultaneously with long slit spectroscopy.", "title": "Narrow passband imagery of comets", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T23:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820006141, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gull, T.
