The sludge, which settles\ndown to the bottom of the settling tank is extracted,\npyrolyzed and activated to form activated carbon and\nash which is mixed with the sewage prior to its introduction into the settling tank, for the purposes mentioned. Because the sludge does not provide all of the\nactivated carbon and ash required for adequate treatment of the raw sewage, it is necessary to add carbon to\nthe process. In accordance with this invention, instead\nof expensive commercial carbon, coal is used to provide\nthe carbon supplement.\n\n3 Claims, No Drawings\n\n1\n\n4,209,393\n\nSEWAGE SLUDGE ADDITIVE\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\n5\n\nThe invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Section 305 of the National\nAeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-568\n(72 Stat. 435; 42 USC 2457).\n10\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nThis invention relates to an improved method and\nmeans for treating raw liquid waste, such as sewage.\nOne of the present day techniques for treating liquid\nwastes such as sewage which comprises water, contaminated by organic and inorganic matter which is dissolved in the water as well as organic and inorganic\nmatter which is suspended in the water, is to mix a\nmaterial, such as activated carbon or activated carbon\nand ash with the raw sewage in a contactor and the\nmixture is then transferred to a settling tank to permit\nadsorption of the dissolved polluting material and settling of the suspended polluting material. The suspended matter, which settles to the bottom of the settling tank, is called sludge, and contains sewage carbon.\nThe sludge is transferred to a filter where it is dewatered and the cakes of dried sludge are then transferred to a pyrolyzing oven where the sewage carbon is\nconverted to elemental carbon which is activated. The\noutput of the pyrolyzer, comprising activated carbon\nand ash is dumped into the contactor to be mixed with\nthe incoming sewage.\nIt has been found that the system described does not\nproduce enough activated carbon to make the system\n\n15\n\n20\n\n2\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENTS\nCommercially purchasable activated carbon costs on\nthe order of 30 to 80 cents per pound, whereas coal\ncosts one to four cents per pound. Therefore, if the\nquantity of coal required to produce an equivalent\nof activated carbon is not too high, and the\nenergy required for the pyrolization process is not excessive, considerable cost savings may be made.\nTo determine whether or not the use of a mixture of\ncoal and sewage sludge to produce activated carbon is\neconomically feasible, in one set of experiments, 2 gram\nsamples were put in a ceramic boat which was placed\ninto a quartz tube. The tube which was about 2.5 cm,\ni.d. was inserted into the furnace and gas, (N2) was\nmade to flow through the furnace at 150 ml/min. As\nshown in Table 1 below, which shows the results of\nPYrOlYSiS, the samples were sewage sludge, Nuchar (a\nCOmerCiallY Purchaseable Carbon), coal, (bituminous)\nNuchar and sewage sludge, and coal sewage sludge.\nwas not lignite*\nThe\nTABLE 1\n\nPYROLYSIS IN NITROGEN2 AT 700\'\nChar + Ash in\nSample\nAsh,\nChar,\nNo.\nComposition Wt %\nWt %\nWt %\n68.4\nIC\nS.S.\n100\n34.9\n2.3\nNuchar\n100\n80.6\n3o\n100\n58.4\n7.8\ncoal\n4\nNuchar\n33\n51.9\n34.9\n\nC.\n\n25\n\nf\n\nChar!\nWt %\n\nAshb\nWt\n\n11.0\n78.1\n53.8\n33.8\n\n?\n6\n24.5\n1.9\n4.6\n18.1\n\nS.S.\n6\n\n40\n\n55.6\n\n29.4\n\n39.3\n\n16.3\n\nS.S.\n\n35\n\n67\n\nNuchar\n\n60\n50\n50\n\n59.9\n\n23.2\n\n46.0\n\n13.9\n\n65.1\n\n18.8\n\n52.9\n\n12.2\n\n42.4\n\n44.4\n\n23.6\n\n18.8\n\nNuchar\n\nS.S.\n7\n\nNuchar\n\nS.S.\n\n57\n43\n33\n67\n\n9\n\ncoal\n\n40\n\n43.6\n\n37.3\n\n27.3\n\n16.3\n\n,o\n\nSS\n..\n\n60\n50\n\n46.6\n\n31.8\n\n31.8\n\n14.8\n\n47.3\n\n26.5\n\n34.8\n\n12.5\n\nS.S.\n\nself-sustaining. Consequently it has been necessary to\nprovide commercial activated carbon to make up the\ndeficiency. However, it has been found that commercial\ncarbon required for this purpose is quite expensive.\n40\nOBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE\nINVENTION\nAn object of this invention is to provide a relatively\ninexpensive supplemental source of carbon for use in 45\ntreating sludge.\nAnother object of this invention is the Provision of a\nnovel and useful source for activated carbon for use in\na sewage treatment plant.\nThe foregoing and other objects of the invention may 50\nbe achieved by mixing coal, and preferably the coal\nknown as lignite with sewage sludge for the purpose of\nproviding supplemental activated carbon. While the\ncoal alone can be pyrolyzed to form activated carbon\n55\nand ash, which thereafter can be mixed with the raw\nsewage in the contactor, it has been found that when\ncoal is mixed with sewage sludge and pyrolyzed the\nsewage sludge acts as a catalyst in the activation process. Also, a mixture of lignite with sodium carbonate 6o\ncan be pyrolyzed to provide activated carbon and ash.\nThe mixture of the coal with the raw sewage or of the\nlignite with the sodium carbonate provides a much\nhigher activation than achievable when lignite alone is\npyrolyzed under the same conditions. Finally, in the 65\ncourse of the pyrolysis the coal provides flammable\nvolatiles or gases suitable for use in the required heating\nand thus can supply part of the energy required.\n\ncoal\n\nCoal\n\nSS\n..\n11\n\nCoal\nS.S.\n__\n\n50\n57\n43\n\n%Nitrogen flow rate 150 mumin; 1 inch quartz tube; temperature: 700\'; duration: 30\nmin sample weights! 2g\n%\' values are wt % of initial sample weights.\nese\n?Ieated for 1 minutes; a second sample heated for 30 min gave approximately the\n0\nsame results, i.e.. 10.2 and 24.5 wt % char and ash, respectively.\ndValues are averages of three runs that agreed within f 1.3 wt % or less\n\nTable 2 shows the results of pyrolysis using coal and\nsewage sludge samples, where the gas used was carbon\nmonoxide.\nTABLE 2\nPYROLYSIS IN CARBON MONOXIDE AT 700\' C.\nChar + Ash in\nAsh\nAsh,\nChar, Char,\nWt\nNO.\nComposition wt %\nwt %\nwt % wt % %\n1\n2\n\nS.S.\nCoal\n\nS.S.\nCoal\n\nS.S.\n\n4\n\nCoal\n\nSS\n..\n\n100\n25\n75\n33\n67\n50\n50\n\n35.3\n41.0\n\n67.5\n47.9\n\n11.5\n21.4\n\n23.8\n19.6\n\n42.8\n\n43.4\n\n24.2\n\n18.6\n\n47.2\n\n30.5\n\n32.8\n\n14.4\n\nBecause of the large gas volume to solids ratio a\nsignificant amount of organic char or tar was evolved\nthat coated the tube walls.
