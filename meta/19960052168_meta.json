The quality of the time available for laboratory experiments can be significantly improved through the use of virtual reality technology.", "title": "Virtual Reality Lab Assistant", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T12:50:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960052168, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Saha, Hrishikesh"}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama A & M Univ.", "location": "Normal, AL United States"}}, "id": "e496f212364346bab1758cb6c02eeddc"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960052168, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Palmer, Timothy A."}, "organization": {"name": "CG2", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "694f539031d04b66ba2fd7bb2d277ec4"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960052168, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960052168, "id": "3e3a767c90664a8daaa61106a6728ac8", "publicationName": "National Educators' Workshop: Update 95.
