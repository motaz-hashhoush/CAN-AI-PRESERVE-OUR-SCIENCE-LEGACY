An in-space propellant depot will provide affordable propellants and other similar consumables to support the development of sustainable and affordable exploration strategies as well as commercial space activities. An in-space propellant depot not only requires technology development in key areas such as zero boil-off storage and fluid transfer, but in other areas such as lightweight structures, highly reliable connectors, and autonomous operations. These technologies can be applicable to a broad range of propellant depot concepts or specific to a certain design. In addition, these technologies are required for spacecraft and orbit transfer vehicle propulsion and power systems, and space life support. Generally, applications of this technology require long-term storage, on-orbit fluid transfer and supply, cryogenic propellant production from water, unique instrumentation and autonomous operations. This paper discusses the reasons why such advances are important to future affordable and sustainable operations in space. This paper also discusses briefly R&D objectives comprising a promising approach to the systems planning and evolution into a meaningful stepping stone design, development, and implementation of an In-Space Cryogenic Propellant Depot. The success of a well-planned and orchestrated approach holds great promise for achieving innovation and revolutionary technology development for supporting future exploration and development of space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20050243419, "endDate": "2005-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "56th International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Fukuoka", "id": "8f6692d3024c4fbbbb5319f53b986237", "startDate": "2005-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050243419, "id": "1fd32a3a4e9440c4ab54c7815ef40c35", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050243419.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050243419/downloads/20050243419.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050243419/downloads/20050243419.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050243419/downloads/20050243419.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
