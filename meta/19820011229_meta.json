Use of solar energy, conservation of energy and of water, safety, and security were incorporated in the design of the house. The terms to be incorporated into the house and to assist in the design of the house were evaluated. An architectural engineering team was employed to investigate energy conservation ideas, determine cost effectiveness of new materials and systems, and prepare specifications and drawings for the house. The Tech House was constructed during the spring of 1976. All the systems were monitored to insure proper operation, and data were collected during a one year occupancy. Results obtained during the family live-in period, comments on the acceptance of the various energy-saving systems by the family, and suggestions for improvement of the systems are presented.", "title": "NASA Technology Utilization House technical support package Summary of results and house description", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T14:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19820011229, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820011229, "id": "dc6f298f7ab644a9aafec7e3e30edd32", "publicationDate": "1979-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820011229.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820011229/downloads/19820011229.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820011229/downloads/19820011229.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820011229/downloads/19820011229.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
