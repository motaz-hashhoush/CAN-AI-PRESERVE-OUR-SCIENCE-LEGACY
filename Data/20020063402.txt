b'Ocean View\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\nAnalytical Spectral\nDevices, Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s\nSeaSpecTM\nspectroradiometer\nwas built to withstand\nthe harsh marine\nenvironment.\n\nS\n\nince August 1997, the OrbView-2 satellite\nhas circled the Earth, providing never-beforeseen color images of our planet\xe2\x80\x99s ocean and\nland surfaces. The on-board NASA Sea-viewing\nWide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) is taking these\nimages. The images not only have commercial\napplications, but scientific researchers around the\nglobe are using them to assess global warming and\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s complex biosphere.\nA primary job for SeaWiFS is to provide quantitative data on global ocean bio-optical properties to\nthe science community. This satellite sensor is\nshedding light on the primary productivity of the\nupper oceans and the fluxes of carbon dioxide and\nother trace gases across the sea-air interface.\nIn order to validate SeaWiFS and develop\nalgorithms, Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD), Inc.,\nof Boulder, Colorado, designed the SeaSpec\xe2\x84\xa2\nspectroradiometer, an underwater system that is\nautonomous and rated to a submersible depth of 200\nmeters. SeaSpec\xe2\x84\xa2 instruments were developed with\nNASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\nfunds through the Goddard Space Flight Center.\nUnlike band-pass radiometers that supply just a\nfew spectral bands, the underwater device has two\ncharge coupled device (CCD) spectrometers to\nprovide continuous spectra, from 350 nautical miles\nto 950 nautical miles. This allows the user to model\n\n58\n\nEnvironment and Resources Management\n\ninformation received from SeaWiFS, as well as all\nexisting and future satellite sensors. The instrument\nitself is only 36 inches in length, with its outside\ndiameter of 8 inches being an aluminum pressure\nhousing. The instrument\xe2\x80\x99s autonomous operation\nand power management allow deployment from a\nfloat or buoy, which enables the sensor to avoid\nerrors caused by light reflection and shadows from a\nship\xe2\x80\x99s hull. The spectroradiometer was built to\nwithstand the harsh marine environment.\nASD has been able to commercialize the engine of\nthe spectroradiometer. The CCD spectroradiometers,\nresulting from the work on SeaSpec\xe2\x84\xa2, have been\nused to create two commercial products. Both now\nenjoy popular use for coastal research. One product,\nthe FieldSpec\xc2\xae VNIR Dual CCD, allows for a small\nsuitcase-sized spectrometer to be placed in a boat. An\nattached fiber optic cable can then be lowered 30 feet\nbelow the surface, allowing researchers to perform\nthe same studies as SeaSpec\xe2\x84\xa2, although not at deepwater depths.\nThe second product, FieldSpec\xc2\xae VNIR-CCD\nspectroradiometer, provides the increased sensitivity\ndemanded by many oceanographic applications.\nWith the addition of fiber optic extension cables, this\ninstrument can be used to measure water surface\nreflected radiance, down-welling solar irradiance, and\nin-water up- and down-welling infrared radiance to\ndepths of 33 feet to over 65 feet.\nData collected by such ocean placed sensors are\nimportant to the planet\xe2\x80\x99s future. Solar irradiance\nmeasurements, for example, are helpful in understanding Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate system. It is very important\nto establish and maintain a long-term record of this\nenergy source.\nSince 1990, ASD has established itself as a leader\nin portable spectroscopic measurement instrumentation. A variety of applications are served by ASD\nequipment, such as portable, visible, and shortwave\ninfrared spectroradiometers for the environmental\nremote-sensing marketplace. ASD\xe2\x80\x99s instruments are\nin wide use for geology, ecology, agriculture, and\nmarine and coastal oceanography. In this regard,\nASD\xe2\x80\x99s instruments are exceptional for ocean color,\nwater quality, primary production, underwater\nvisibility, algal bloom characteristics, and sea floor\noptical characteristics.\nSeaSpecTM is a trademark of Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.\nFieldSpec\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.\n\n'
