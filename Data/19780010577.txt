"The characteristics of the two-component\n\nF1\n\nsystem permit us to choose at will the initial conditions of pressure and temperature independent of one another, thus making it possible for it not only to\ntake the place of a PCM in regions for which no suitable substances exist,\n\nt1\n\nF\nR\n\nbut also to replace PCMs in regions where it can offer better pressure conditions" (Ref. 5, note: PCM is substituted in the preceding quote for the original\nC-stage notation). In the low-temperature region suitable PCM materials are\nin short supply. In fact, the lowest melting potential PCM thus far identified\nin the present study has a melting temperature of 129 K (Ref. 3). For storage\nof liquid oxygen, hydrogen, and helium, the required temperatures are in the\n\niJ\n\nH\n\nrange of about 90 to Fbout 1.5 K.\nIn the following section a number of concepts are presented and their\noperation discussed. A subsequent section presents indicated directions for\nfurther research and development.\n\n[9\n\nH\n\nFrom the consideration presented in the following sections, it is concluded that adsorption thermal control appears as a very promising concept\nin the cryogenic: temperature region. More detailed analyses and tests of\n\nL;\n\nparticular appli:ations, however, are required for a realistic estimate of\nits potential.\n\nH\n\nPOSSIBL CONCEPTS FOR CRYOGENIC THERMAL CONTROL\nA number of preliminary concepts utilizing adsorption thermal control\nwere presented in a previous paper that was written under the present con-\n\nB\n0\n\ntract (Ref. 3). One of the concepts presented in that paper, as well as some\nfurther arrangements that have suggested themselves since, are shown in\nFig. 1.\nIn Case (a) cryogen vented from a storage tank would be collected on\ncharcoal or other suitable adsorbent. Just before a measurement is to be\nmade, the whole apparatus would be cooled in space to about 100 K or, by\n\n2\n\nC?\n\nLOCKHEED \xe2\x80\xa2 HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH 6 ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D568188\n\nIt\nzple\n\npace\nTo\nSpace\n\n)al\t\n\n--\n\n1 ____ --\n\nStorage\nTank\n(a)\n\n-\n\ny .. 5 -\n\n(b)\nSuperinsulation\n^--" -\n\nAdsorbate/\nAdsorbent\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\nFig. 1 - Concepts for Cryogenic Thermal Control\n3\t\n\nPAGE IS\nORIGIN AL UALI`PY\nOF POOR Q\n\nLOCKHEED\xe2\x80\xa2HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nl MuC-Illtl;C Tl( U\'i68lHH\n\nsome other means, to even lower temperatures. Further reduction in temperature would then be achieved by venting adsorbed gas to space. The\n\narrangement in Case (a) is very similar to desorption cryostats used pre[\t\nviously to attain very low temperatures. For example, by desorb ; ng helium\nfrom charcoal it was possible to hold a temperature of 21 K for over 30\njminutes when 100 mW were being generated in the calorimeter in addition\nto the normal heat leaks (Ref.6). In another study, temperatures in the\nrange of 4 to 14 K were maintained with a constancy of \xc2\xb10.001 K by helium\ndesorption from charcoal (Ref. 7).\nIn Case (b) cryogen that would otherwise be vented to space would be\ncollected on absorbent. The heat of adsorption can either be radiated or\nvented into space. Further venting of the adsorbed cryogen vapor would\n\nN\t\n\nItS\t\nf\'.\t\n\nhave the effect of cooling the remaining gas, adsorbent, and container to\nliquefaction. Thus, a portion of the normal boil-off could be saved. Figure\n2 presents a more sophisticated scheme for recovering part of the normal\ncryogenic boil-off. The systems operates as follows:\nStep No.\n\n3\n\n1\t\n\nChambers A and B are initially evacuated.\nChamber B contains activated charcoal.\n\n2\t\n\nValves 1 and 2 open, filling chambers A\nand B. Heat is given off by the charcoal\nand chambers A and B are allowed to reach\nthermal equilibrium.\n\n3\t\n\nValve 3 is open slowly, venting chamber A\nto space and then closed.\n\n4\t\n\nValve 2 is opened, filling chamber A.\n\n5\t\n\nValve 4 is opened slowly, venting chamber B\t\nand then closed. The charcoal absorbs heat\nfrom the condensing gas in chamber A. When\nthermal equilibrium is reached, valves 2 and\n\nf?\t\n} ^y\t\n\nC\n\n{)\n\n4 are closed.\n\n6\t\n\nValves 1 and 5 are opened. Heat liberated by\ncharcoal causes the pressure to rise in chamber\nA driving the liquid cryogen back into the tank.\nAfter equilibrium is reached, valves 1 and 5\n\nare closed. Then, go to step 3.\n\n4\nd\nLOCKHEED -HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH 6 ENGINEERING CENTER\n\ni\n\nLMSC-HREC TR 0568188\n\n/\n\nMLI and PCM\n--------------------~\n\nI\'rcH8ure Helice\n\n>,\n\n10 1\n~\n\nl\n\nCryogen\nTank\n\n1\n\nGJ\nU\n\n\'...\n"\n\nfJ)\n\n.)\n\n.....\n.....\n\ns::\n\nA\n\nGJ\n\n>\nGa,s\n\nLiquid -\n\n-----\n\nOne Way\n\nCharcoal in\nChamber B\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nFloat\n\n5\n\nFrom\nInstruments\n\nOR1GINAL PA~\nOF pOOR QU\n\nFig. l - Adsorption Recovery System\n\n5\n\nLOCKHEED\xc2\xb7 HUNTSVILl.E RESEARCH & ENGINEERI\';C CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D568188\n\n(\t\nt :,\n\nA simple process analysis using the latent heat of helium, the heat of\nacsorption of helium or charcoal and assuming a 70% heat transfer efficiency\nwas performed. The results indicate that it may be possible to recover as\nmuch as 50% of the boiloff from cryogen systems.\nDesorption has been reported previously as a means to produce low\ntemperature either directly (Ref. 5) or as a precooling technique (Ref. 8).\n\nIj\n\nIn Case (c) temperature control is maintained around the cryogen by\nventing to space. The advantage of this arrangement over direct venting\nto space lies in more precise temperature control and in the\n\nvery large\n\nheat capacity of saturated charcoal (Ref. 6).\nt\n\nCase (d) represents a refrigerator. Thermal energy desorbs adsorbate\nfrom adsorbent in one bulb. As a result of the desorption, the pressure builds.\nThe gas under pressure is then expanded through a pressure relief valve, the\nexpansion causing a cooling in the cooling coil. Expanded gas is collected\non adsorbent in the other bulb which is maintained at a lower temperature\n\nH\n\nthan the heated bulb. When adsorbate is all expelled from the first bulb, the\nprocess can be repeated in reverse. An adsorption refrigerator was developed and used in the late 20s and early 1930s (Refs. 9 and 10). Why it faded\n\n1.9\n\nfrom use is a mystery. Apparently the device was quite efficient. For space\napplication, an adsorption refrigeration unit appears attractive.\n\nRELATED SPACE USE OF ADSORPTION\n\nB\na\n\nAdsorption on molecular sieves was suggested as a means by which\noxygen from a stored solid state could be delivered in a breathable state\n(Ref. 11). The experimental test arrangement for the concept is shown in\nFig. 3.\nThe working vessel consists of a double-wall container, evacuation\nlines, a pressure sensing tube, and an evacuation line leading into the space\nbetween the double walls. The space between the double walls can be evac-\n\nP\n\nuated to provide an insulation space or filled with helium gas to serve as a\n6\n\nLOCKHEED\xe2\x80\xa2HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH & ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D568188\n\nI\t\n\nClosed\t\nor\n\n?()0?\n?()O QU\n.\n\nOpen\n\nWV\nG\nnWarming\n\nTo Helium\nGas Supplv\n\ni-Closed\n\nLiquid Oxygen\nFill\n\nTo Vacuum\t\n\nPumping\n\nModel K-!\nTest\t\nDewar\t\n\n1\n\n-Cold Cocstant\nTemperature\nBath\n\nO\n\nNitrogen\t\n\nT\n\nClosed\nSolid Oxygen\t\nStorage\nContainer\n\nClosed\n\xe2\x80\x94 -\t\n\n-\n\nSNZ\nCryosorption\nPumps\n\nFig.3 - Experimental Setup-Transport by Adsorbents (Ref. 11)\n7\nLOCKHEED\xe2\x80\xa2HUNTSVILLE RESEARCH d ENGINEERING CENTER\n\nLMSC-HREC TR D568188\n\nthermal conductor.

Although\nmultiple layer insulation (MLI) has been used exU\n\n1\n\nclusively for insulating cryogenic storage tanks,\n\nimprovement in thermal control is indicated by use\nof energy storage materials ( ESM) in conjunction\nwith MLI. ESMs store large amounts of thermal\n\nenergy by means of sensible heat, heat of fusion,\nor reaction heat. This paper presents recent results of concept evaluation and experimental\nstudies on phase change and gas adsorbea ESMs.\n\nA differential thermal analysis (DTA) technique\n\nwas utilized in the experimental studies. Gas adsorber ESMs appear to offer unique possibilities\nfor cryogenic thermal control.\n\nl\n\nI\n\nC\nJ\n\nI\n\nThe problem of storic , g cryogens during longterm space voyages has been approached in the\npast primarily from the viewpoint of multiple layer\ninsulation ( MLI) improvement. The concept of\nthermal control by means of physical or chemical\nreaction heats has not yet been explored for cryo-\n\nwithout significant changes of tem p erature. The\nobjectives ofthe present study, therefore, were to\nconduct such an exploration and to perform some\npreliminary experimental tests of energy storage\nmaterial ( ESM) effectiveness.\n\nThe nomenclature ESM used in this paper refers to materials that store and liberate large\n\namounts of thermal energy by means of mechanisms such as sensible heat, heat of fusion, and\nphysical or chemical reaction heat. Because of the\nability to store and liberate large amounts of ther-\n\nmal energy, ESMs are capable of acting as thermal\n\ncontrol devices. In previous works (Refs. Ithrough\n\n0\n\nTwo possible ESM-MLI arrangements suggest\nthemselves. These are shown in Figure 1. In\n\nconcept A of Figure 1, the ESM would have a transition temperature near the desired storage temperature of the cryogen. In concept B, the ESM\nwould be on the outside of the superinsulation.\nIn order to obtain an idea of how such systems\n\nmight actually operate, simplified models were developed for input into Lockheed\'s Thermal Analyzer Computer Program. This program solves\nthose differential equations that represent the time\ndependent heat conduction problem (Ref. 4). The\nfollowing three models were compiled and run.\nI.

If the container is provided with a piston\narrangement, however, so that heat addition can occur at essentially constant\nl\t\n\npressure, our system achieves zero degrees of freedom. Thus heat can be\n\n(\t\n\nadded or subtracted without the temperature changing.
