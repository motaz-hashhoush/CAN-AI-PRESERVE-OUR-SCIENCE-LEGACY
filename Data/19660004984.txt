A second mgjor contributing factor is the\npresence of impurities introduced into the cell either during its mqmfacture\no r formed as degradation products from cell components during t h e operation\nof the cell.\nThe objective of the program is to determine the relative importance of\nthese two factors and the extent to which the variability in cell performance\ncan be reduced.\n\nThe experimental work w i l l include detailed studies of\n\nindividual positive electrodes and cyclic sealed cell performance tests.\nDuring the first quarter on experimental facility to measure the onset\nand the r a t e of oxygen evolution from positive electrodes was assembled and\npartially tested. The facility has a capacity for testing six electrodes simultaneously.\n\nThe equipment has provisions for recording the rate of oxygen\n\nevolution, electrode potentials versus a reference electrode during charge\nand discharge. The equipment w i l l permit the study of the positive electrode\n0ep-.-:- u r over a range of charge and discharge r&es ~n a repetitive cycle\ni a v l\nbasis.\nIn addition t o above work, literature pertaining to the effects of impurities\non the nickel-cadmium system w a s reviewed and approaches and areas of\nemphasis for the impurity studies w e r e selected.\n\n2\n\n2.0 PROGRAM SCOPE AND PLANS\n,\nb\n\nAn outline of the scope of the program is given in Table 2- 1.\n2. 1 Positive Electrode Behavior Studies\n\nThe results of the previous work show that a l a r g e part of the e r r a t i c\nbehavior of nickel-cadmium cells can be assigned t o the behavior of the\nnickel hydroxide electrodes used in the cells.\n\nThe causes for this e r r a t i c\n\nbehavior a r e not w e l l understood nor does the behavior appear t o be predictable on the basis of previous cycle data or general history.\n\nPart of the\n\ne r r a t i c behavior must result from the high degree of nonreversibility of the\nelectrode, The electrode is thermodynamically unstable with respect t o\noxidation of water in the presence of alkali, and only the high overvoltage\n\nfor oxygen evolution on nickel and nickel oxide-hydroxide s u r f a c e s makes\npossible the charging and use of a nickel (111) hydroxide electrode.\nThe voltage of the positive electrode during charging is a function of the\nstate-of-the-charge of the electrode and the previous cycling history of the\ncell.\n\nThe voltage should show a marked inflection at the end of charge but\n\ndoes not.\n\nThis is attributable to the formation of mixed nickel (11) and (In)\n\nhydroxides in the electrode during charging. These hydrQxides a r e present\n\nas a single solid phase and therefore show only a mixed potential for the\nelectrode. The electrode voltage therefore r i s e s a s the charging proceeds\nwith no sharp break in the voltage curve at the end of the charge associated\nwith t h e change from nickel (11) t o nickel (111). Associated with this mixed\npotential of the plus two and plus three valence states of nickel, is the mixed\npotential associated with the evolution of oxygen from the surface of the\nelectrode. The net result is that the charge voltage of the nickel-cadmium\ncell is more a function of t h e previous history of the cell than it is of the\nthermodynamic properties of nickel (11) and nickel (111) hydroxides. It is\npossible t o make this charging potential fall within a narrow band of values\nby appropriate treatment of the electrode; it is not clearly understood how\nthis treatment works.\n\nThe voltage on discharge also shows variations de-\n\npending upon cycle history which may be due again to changes in the electrode,\nparticularly the electrode surface, brought about during the previous oper ation of the cell.\n3\n\nTable 2 - 1\n\nPROGRAM SCOPE\n\nc\n\nTASK 1:\n\nStudy of the positive electrode behavior\nA.\nB.\n\nCapacity relationships\n\nC.\n\nGassing behavior during charge, stand, and discharge\n\nD.\n\nTASK 2:\n\nVoltage behavior during charge and discharge\n\nMechanical aspects of overcharge behavior\n\nStudy of the sources and effects of impurities in nickel-cadmium\ncells.\n\nA.\n\nManufacturing impurities\n1.\n2.\n\nPlate\n\n3.\n\nB.\n\nElectrolyte\n\nConstruction techniques\n\nCell degradation products\n1.\n\nCorrosion of components\n\n2.\n\nDecomposition of organic materials used in the\ncell construction\n\nm r\n\ni n e capacity of a positive electrode shows three distinct types of capacity\n\nduring normal operation of the cell. These types a r e : a permanent capacity\nwhich constitutes the greater part of the capacity of the cell that is obtained\non discharge at cell voltages above one volt; a temporary capacity which is\nobtained at a somewhat higher voltage, but which is lost upon stand within a\nshort period of time; and finally, a so-called graphitic capacity which is\nassociated with a lower output voltage in the vicinity of 0.9 volt which is\nobtained at the end of discharge of the cell.\n\nThe permanent capacity is only\n\nrelatively permanent, a s it is lost at a slow r a t e depending upon cell history,\ncell construction, and particularly temperature.\nThe temporary capacity appears t o be associated with the charging of\nthe permanent capacity by being made up of the initial active species formed\non charging; p a r t of this species reverts t o permanent capacity upon stand,\n\n4\n\nand part is lost by reaction of the active species with the electrolyte t o form\noxygen.\n\nIn any case, the temporary capacity is lost within 48 hours after\n\nshutting off the charging current; the loss may be as much as 20 percent of\nthe total capacity delivered above one volt.\n\nA large amount of work has been\n\ndone t o determine the nature of the electrode material making up the tempor a r y capacity and how t o stabilize or convert it to permanent capacity.\nlittle success has been reported in this regard.\n\nVery\n\nThe temporary capacity is\n\na critical element i n space applications in which the cells a r e charged and\nimmediately discharged on short cycles since it contributes a large part of\nthe capacity obtained from the cells during operation.\nThe graphitic capacity w a s given this name because it was formerly\nthought to be associated with the graphite that was incorporated in early\ndesigns of positive electrodes. However, this particular capacity p e r s i s t s\neven in the absence of graphite in the structure and is now attributed t o adsorbed oxygen gas that is held by the lattice of the nickel sinter.\n\nThis oxygen\n\nmay be in the form of absorbed oxygen on the nickel substrate, or it may be\nin the f o r m of a peroxide type of compound with nickel or cobalt.\n\nIn any case,\n\nthe discharge of this capacity occurs at a voltage substantially lower than for\nthe normal capacity of the cell.\n\nTherefore it is not considered to be parti-\n\ncularly useful as a capacity in the cell.\n\nThe w o r k on the previous eoiitract\n\nshowed that graphitic capacity in general decreased.with cycle life.\n\nIn a few\n\ncases the capacity increased.\nIn the proposed investigation of the capacity behavior of the nickel hydroxide electrode, the emphasis w i l l be on obtaining data relating t o the causes\n\nfor the change of the graphitic capacity and its relation t o change in p e r manent capacity.\n\nEmphasis w i l l also be given to obtaining data relating t o\n\nthe stabilization and utilization of the temporary capacity in the discharge\ncycle f o r space applications.\n\nF r o m the design standpoint, the change in\n\ncapacity of the positive electrode with u s e is critical, since most space cells\nmust maintain a careful balance between the negative and positive electrode\ncapacities in o r d e r to promote gas recombination.\n\n5\n\nThe gassing characteristics of the positive electrodes a r e highly irregu-\n\nlar from cycle t o cycle; they particularly vary with the previous history of\nthe electrode. It is apparent that the process is highly irreversible and is\nsubject t o a high activation energy f o r the formation of molecular oxygen,\nand that a catalyst of some s o r t is involved in the electrode process evolving\noxygen.\n\nThis catalyst may be associated with the formation of nickel (111)\n\noxide in the presence of the cobalt that is normally present in the electrode\nThe onset of gassing occurs e a r l i e r fn repeated cycles\n\nduring fabrication.\n\nwhen the electrode is first cycled; finally coming into a region in which the\ninitial gassing in a cycle occurs in a band of values between 40 t o 60 percent\nof charge. The amount of gassing is a l s o dependent t o some extent on the\nprevious history but varies from cycle t o cycle in an i r r e g u l a r manner.\n\nThe\n\nimportance of the gassing behavior is that it represents a loss of charge\nacceptance and therefore must be known i f a suitable charging regime for the\ncells is td be selectefl, In addition, the gassing characteristic determines t o some\nextent the p r e s s u r e s that a r e going to b e built up in the cell during charging\noperations which in t u r n determine some of the structural requirements of\nthe cells.\n\nThe actual work on gassing w i l l be largely t o determine factors\n\ninvolved in the gassing process and what, i f any, impurities or other t r e a t ment can be used to make t h e gassing m o r e uniform in cell operation.\nThe mechanical aspects of the positive electrode behavior a r e largely\nassociated with overcharge of t h e electrode.\n\nDuring overcharge, oxygen is\n\nevolved from the electrode, and it has been found that this oxygen evolution\nexerts a profound influence on the structural stability of the nickel s i n t e r s\nin the electrode.\n\nThe resistance to destruction by oxygen evolution varies\n\nf r o m lot to lot of nickel s i n t e r s in a manner that is not directly related t o\nany of the known process variables. The destruction appears t o b e caused\nby the formation of gas bubbles i n the interior of the metal sinter which\nexert a l a r g e force as they grow by electrochemical formation of oxygen.\nThese finally lift portions of the sinter structure from the substrate.\n\nIt is\n\nnot too uncommon t o find electrode structures disintegrating in a short\nperiod of operation.\n\nHowever, using the s a m e procedures for making these\n\n6\n\nelectrodes and controlling the variables as closely as possible, other batches\nof electrode material show a relatively high resistance t o this form of destruction. It therefore becomes important to determine what variable is\nresponsible for the destruction of the electrodes in one c a s e and not in the\nsecond, and also t o determine the importance of this in t e r m s of the life of a\ncell and i t s operation.\n2.2 Impurity Study\n\nThere a r e two sources of impurities in sealed nickel-cadmium cells;\none arising from manufacturing operations and the other arising from chemical attack on the material used in the cells during the operation of the cell,\nThe impurities introduced by manufacturing techniques a r e in theory controllable by adequate quality control procedures; however, complete removal of\nsome of these impurities would introduce prohibitive costs in manufacturing\ncells.\n\nImpurities such as dirt, welding flux residues, metallic chips, and\n\ndust, are beyond the scope of t h i s study since these a r e impurities that can\nbe completely eliminated with ordinary care.\nHowever, there a r e a number of impurities that c a n be introduced into\nthe cell during manufacturing that cannot be avoided except by taking exceptional c a r e ; in most cases, extra steps must b e used in processing the\nmaterials in the cells t o remove the impurity. Among these impurities a r e :\nnitrates and metallic impurities introduced into the plates during impregnation;\nand chlorides, sulfates, and carbonates introduced into the cell in the electrolyte.\n\nThe effects of these impurities have been studied t o some extent by\n\nprevious workers; most of the work has been done on the effect of the\nimpurities on the early behavior of the cell, with little emphasis on the\n\neffect on cell life.\n\nA t present, t h e r e is no good nondestructive method for the determination\nof nitrates in a cell.\n\nHowever, we have found that there is a plateau in the\n\ndischarge curve of a positive electrode that corresponds t o the reduction of\nnitrite to ammonia.\n\nThis plateau is seen only on overdischarge of the\n\n7\n\nelectrode at low r a t e s ; the a r e a under the curve is proportional t o the amount\nof nitrite reduced.\n\nThis may s e r v e as the basis for a nitrate analysis in the\n\ncompleted cell and w i l l be investigated.\nWork at the S A F T Research Laboratory, in France, has shown that\nsulfate and chloride a r e relatively innocuous as impurities in the levels that\nmight be experienced in the electrolyte.\n\nThey would occur in the electrolyte\n\nas a result of carrying over t r a c e s of the starting materials from which\npotassium hydroxide is made; namely, potassium chloride or potassium sulfate.\n\nOf more critical importance would be carbonate impurities which can\n\nbe introduced as a contaminant f r o m air.\n\nIt should be noted that carbonate\n\ncan be derived from oxidation of organic matter during operation of the cells\n\ns o that the initial control of carbonate concentration i n the electrolyte does\nnot necessarily mean that no carbonate influence will be found in the cells at\n\na l a t e r date.\nThe presence of carbonate affects the potential of the cadmium electrode\nwhen it replaces part of the hydroxyl ion i n the electrolyte. A s long as\nthere is sufficient hydroxyl ion present, the cadmium electrode is unaffected\nat room temperatures and above, since cadmium hydroxide is much l e s s\nsoluble than the carbonate.\n\nHowever, if t h e r e is insufficient hydroxyl ion\n\npresent, the cadmium precipitates a s the carbonate, with\n0 . 1 volt on discharge.\n\ntemperatures.\n\n?c\n\nloss of a b m t\n\nCarbonate has a particularly adverse effect at low\n\nThe drop in potential due t o formation of cadmium carbonate\n\nis s e r i o u s in cell applications where the cells are discharged t o final cell\n\npotentials of one volt, as the apparent capacity w i l l be decreased.\nSmall amounts of nitrate impurities in nickel-cadmium cells increase\nthe self-discharge r a t e and also appear t o decrease the capacity of the positive\nelectrode. The reaction mechanism appears to vary with temperature and\ncycling conditions. In one case, the reaction appears to be the cyclic\nreduction of nitrate at the charged cadmium electrode followed by oxidation\nof nitrite at the charged positive electrode. In another case, t h e r e is\nevidence that the nitrate can be ultimately reduced t o ammonia and eventually\nnitrogen.\n\nWhich of the mechanisms prevails and under what conditions is\n\n8\n\nimportant since in the former case, the discharge reaction would prevail\nthrough out the use of the cell whereas in the latter, the effect is ultimately\nThis point will be studied in the current program.\n\nremoved by cycling.\n\nAdditional impurities can be introduced during manufacturing operations\nby the thermal decomposition of organic cell materials near the welds made\nt o s e a l off the cell.\n\nThus, thermal decomposition of the fluorothene cell\n\nliner used to insulate the electrode pack from the cell c a s e would introduce\nfluoride and chloride.\n\nThermal decomposition of any epoxy used to coat the\n\nunderside of the cell terminals, or the thermal decomposition of any elastom e r used t o make the seals, would also introduce impurities in the cell\nsystem. In the c a s e of epoxies, nitrogenous impurities could be introduced\n(nitrogen compounds a r e used as curing agents in most epoxy formulations9\nds well as carbonate and carboxylic that would be generated by oxidation of\n\nthe epoxy carbon chain.\n\nImpurities from s e a l elastomers a r e probably not\n\nharmful. If the elastomer is heated sufficiently t o give off injurious amounts\nof impurities the heating w i l l probably result in a damaged s e a l that w i l l not\np a s s subsequent tests.\n1Metallic impurities such as iron, copper, zinc, etc. , c&nbe introduced\ninto the plates during impregnation. Of these, iron is the most likely and is\n\na serious impurity in positive electrodes since it seriously limits the d e M i e r able capacity of the electrode. However, iron is very often added to the cadmium plate as an expander. Therefore, its presence in the cadmium plate\nis not of too much concern.\n\nThe presence of iron as an impurity in the\n\nnickel hydroxide electrode can b e due t o the corrosion of the iron grids used\nin cell construction and t o an impurity in the nickel nitrate used for impregnstion.\n\nThe presence of cobalt, which is common i n commercial nickel salts,\n\nis not considered an impurity as it is deliberately added in many formulations\n\nf o r the positive electrodes. Previous work h a s shown that some impurities,\nsuch as magnesium and aluminum, have a promotional effect on the positive\nelectrodes r a t h e r than a\n\ndeleterious effect and therefore a r e of little concern.\n\nThe impurities introduced into the cell during operation a r i s e from a\nchemical attack on the cell construction materials by oxygen and caustic.\n\n9\n\nPossible impurities that can be introduced in this manner include silver\nfrom the silver solder used to make hermetic seals, aluminum from the\nceramic portions of the seals, i r o n from the case and electrode leads, nitrogenous materials from nylon separators, carbonate and carboxylic acids from\nseparators, cell liners and wetting agents, and fluoride, chlorides and cyanides\nfrom separator or lining materials.\nThe effects of some of these impurities a r e known t o a limited extent.\nThus, silver h a s been reported t o form dendrites in the cell during operation\nthat result in shorting of the electrodes. \'Silver is known t o be a catalyst for\nthe oxidation of organic materials i n the presence of alkali by oxygen.\n\nThe\n\noxidation of the separator material is known to occur in cells during their\nlifetime, even with resistant materials such as nylon and polypropylene.\nOxidation of nylon would result in the formation of carbonates, carboxylic\nacids, and combined with hydrolysis induced by the alkali, ammonia or other\nnitrogenous derivatives. Oxidation of polypropylene would give carbonates\nand carboxylic acids; the oxidation of Dyne1 would give carbonates, carboxylic\nacids, and possibly cyanide or ammonia.\n\nThe formation of some of the\n\nintermediate oxidation products f r o m the separators is known to be\nbeneficial probably because they enhance the wetting characteristics of the\n\nseparator.\nThe origin and quantity of these impurities introduced into the cell w i l l\nbe determined in the program by exposing appropriate materials to systems\nsimulating the cell environment: caustic electrolyte and free oxygen in the\npresence of nickel (111).\n\nWhere possible, the nature of the impurity obtained\n\nby breakdown of organic materials w i l l be determined by suitable analytical\ntechniques and the amount of the impurity estimated.\n\nThe effects of the\n\nimpurities w i l l be determined in cell tests.\n2 . 3 Work Plans\n\nT h e electrodes t o be used in the program w i l l be type VO positives and\nnegatives made at the General Electric Company-Battery Business Section\n\nfacility at Gainesville, Florida.\n\nPlate dimensions w i l l be the s a m e as used\n\n10\n\nin the previous program 1 3/4x 3 inches.\n\nThe positives will have a normal\n\ncapacity of 1 . 0 ampere hours and the negatives 1.5 ampere hours.\n\nA lot of\n\n1000 plates each of positives and negatives w i l l be available f o r t h e program.\n\nThese plates a r e scheduled for delivery in late September.\n\nPlate manufactur-\n\ning history and characteristics w i l l b e available.\nThe plates w i l l be given identification numbers and weighed as received.\nThe lots w i l l be sampled and the plates w i l l be initially characterized by six\ncharge-discharge cycles using a C / 4 r a t e based on the nominal capacity of\nthe positive plates, for both charge and discharge at ambient temperature.\nComplete potential-time curves versus reference electrode w i l l be recorded\nfor these cycles. A sufficient number of plates w i l l be characterized in this\nmanner t o obtain a capacity distribution curve for the lots.\n\nPlates from the\n\nlow, average and high regions of the capacity distribution curve w i l l be used\nin the positive electrode behavior studies.\n\nThis procedure w i l l permit a\n\ndetermination of the effect of plate capacity on the positive electrode behavior.\nThe characterization procedure will also permit the selection of plates with\nclosely matched capacities for u s e in the fabrication of test cells for the\nimpurities studies.\nIn the positive electrode behavior studies, the p r i m a r y parameters t o be\ninvestigated w i l l be the effect of charging r a t e s over the range of C / l O to C,\nthe effects of repetitive charging at fixed r a t e s versus variation in charge\nr a t e f r o m cycle t o cycle, and the effects of cyclic operation partially discharging of the positive electrode t o various depths versus complete discharge.\n\nFor t h e electrodes on partial discharge type cycling, the residual czpacity\nw i l l b e periodically determined t o note if memory effects are correlated with\ncharge rate sequences, state of charge or gassing behavior.\n\nSelf-discharge\n\ncharacteristics on open circuit will be monitored making gas evolution\nmeasurements along with voltage decay versus time from various states of\ninitial charge.\nIn addition, the short t e r m effects of impurities identified in Task 2 on\nthe positive electrode behavior with respect t o voltage, capacity and gassing\nr a t e w i l l also be determined p r i o r to cell tests.\n\n11\n\nAn attempt w i l l be made t o\n\nrelate observed voltage, capacity and gassing behavior variations t o structural\n\nor chemical changes in the electrodes.\nA r e a s of emphasis on t h e impurities studies w i l l be to identify the sources\nand effects of nitrates, chlorides, and other halides; the effects of degradation\nproducts from separators and wetting agents, and other organic materials\nused in cell construction; and metallic ions from cell components.\nThe effects of impurities w i l l be determined by specific ion addition to\nthe cell electrolyte at controlled concentrationIevels where possible and by\nthe addition of electrolyte which has been previously in contact with a specific\ncomponent under conditions t o promote degradation of the component.\n\nFor\n\nexample, the degradation of the separator material would b e accomplished by\nrefluxing the separator material in the electrolyte in the presence of oxygen\nat elevated temperatures for a fixed period of time.\n\nThe same experiment\n\ncould be repeated by having a charged positive electrode present during the\nrefluxing t o note i f it contributes t o the degradation\'process. Similar type\nexperiments could be performed with any of the cell components individually\nt o identify if they a r e a source of deleterious impurity. At the present time,\nwe intend t o r e s t r i c t the degrading type experiments t o the range of 50-60\xc2\xb0C\nand initially t o exposure times of 50-100 hours,\n\nThe resultant electrolyte\n\nwitn tne degraded or reaction products would then be added to a test ceii for\nevaluation of its effect on performance.\n\nChemical analysis would be employed\n\nt o identify components present in the electrolyte and concentrations.\n\nThe\n\namount of electrolyte added t o a test cell would be varied depending on the\nconcentration levels in the sample,\n\n12\n\n3 . 0 EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT\n\nDuring the first Quarter, the experimental apparatus for monitoring oxygen evolution continuously during controlled charge and discharge cycling w a s\ninstalled and tested.\n\nFigure 3 - 1 shows a schematic diagram of the oxygen\n\nmonitoring system. Basically, nitrogen carrier gas is fed t o a manifold\nsystem through a Fairchild Stratos precision p r e s s u r e regulator s o that the\nmanifold p r e s s u r e is held constant i n the range of 2 0 - 3 0 psi gauge pressure.\nThe flow r a t e of the c a r r i e r gas through the precision needle valves is\nessentially independent of minor pressure changes downstream.\n\nThe gas is\n\nsaturated with water vapor by bubbling through a solution of potassium\nhydroxide of the s a m e composition as the t e s t cell electrolyte.

This value\n2\nvaries from one cell t o another, of course, and must be set and calibrated\nseparately for each channel.\n\nA constant temperature bath must be used\n\nwith the monitoring cells because of the temperature coefficient of oxygen\npermeation in the Teflon membrane.\nThe nitrogen flow r a t e should be set, however, s o that the maximum\n\n03\nconcentration of oxygen w i l l not exceed 1 \' 0 s o that the differential of voltage\nchange with respect t o oxygen partial p r e s s u r e change will remain essentially\nconstant over the course of the experimental run.\n\nLow flow r a t e s of c a r r i e r\n\ngas (-5 cc/min) a r e indicated to determine the onset of gassing while higher\nflow r a t e s (-20-40 cc/min) w i l l b e required t o monitor total gassing behavior.\nAssuming the voltage recorded on the r e c o r d e r s is directly proportional to\npartial p r e s s u r e of oxygen in the gas s t r e a m , the effect of flow r a t e on the\nrecorded potential at different gassing r a t e s may be seen in Figure 3-3.\nAn additional complicating factor is that the input impedance of the\nRustrak 98DC Amplifier is 1 megohm.\n\nTherefore, the resistance of the\n\ncurrent measuring portion of the oxygen sensor cell circiiit is Iiniited to abeiit\n100,000 ohms t o p r e s e r v e scale linearity.\n\nThis in effect limits the lower\n\nsensitivity of the oxygen detection to about 0. 05\'30 oxygen in the c a r r i e r gas\n(when 0.2 mv on the r e c o r d e r is assumed t o be the lowest reading discernible\nf r o m "noise" on the recorder). At low c a r r i e r gas flow r a t e s (-5 cc/min) this\ncorresponds t o the 1 ma gassing rate.\nFigure 3-4 is a schematic representation of the t e s t cell used in this\nsystem.\nAn alternate method of monitoring gassing r a t e uses a Niedrach-Alford\ntype electrode in conjunction with charged cadmium counter electrodes t o\nconsume the oxygen as fast as it is generated and monitoring the resulting\ncurrent.\n\nThis requires a modified top f o r the test cell shown in Figure 3-4.\n\nFigure 3 - 5 is a representation of the oxygen sensing modification and the\n\n16\n\nm\n\na\n,\n\n-+\n\ncd\n\nP;\n\nB\n0\nI\n+\n\ncrc\n-+\nE\nk\n\na,\n\nrcr\nrcr\n\nb"\n\n+\ncd\n\nm\n\n8\nk\n\na\n,\nk\n\n.rl\n\nk\n\ns\nc\nc\n\n-4\n\na,\n\nM\n\nh\n\nx\n0\nrcr\n\n0\n\na\n,\nk\n\nz\n\nm\n\na\nk\n\nPI\nI\n+\n\ncd\n\n.,I\n\n-+\n\nk\n\n2\nM\nI\n\nM\n\na\n,\nk\n\n3\n\n9\n.\n\nM\n\n2\n\n4\n\nN\nd\n\n0\n\n0\n\nco\n\nr\nl\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n*\n\nCJ\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nco\n\nc\n\n17\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNitrogen, 0 2 ,to Beckman\n0 2 Monitor\n\nNitrogen in\n\nsket\n\nFigure 3 - 4 .\n\nOxygen Monitoring Test Cell.\n\n18\n\nc\nm\n0\n0\nI\n4\n\nCharged Cadmium Plates\n\nI\\\n\n0\n\n1\n\nI\n\nTest Electrodes, Etc.\n\nFigure 3 - 5 .\n\nAlternate Oxygen Monitoring Test Cell.\n\n19\n\nrequired electrical circuit.\n\nUse of an auxiliary relay switch can change the\n\nsensitivity from approximately 5 ma (when full scale deflection is 250 ma)\nt o direct reading i n microamperes gassing current i f desired.\n\nSuch low\n\ngassing rates, however, would be difficult to observe because of the solubility\nof the gas in the electrolyte and the slow diffusion in the test cell.\n\nNeverthe-\n\nl e s s the sensitivity of this technique is sufficiently greater, that it warrants\nfurther consideration.\nFigure 3 - 6 shows a part of the six station oxygen monitoring facility.\nThe oxygen test cell in the center with the bubblers and flowmeters for five\nstations in the background.\n\nThe bubblers will be raised above their present\n\nposition when the test program is underway.\n\nThe cell on the left is a proto-\n\ntype of the alternate test cell.\nFigure 3-7 shows the test traces of gassing determination t r i a l runs\nperformed using the two cells shown in Figure 3 - 6 .\n\nThe top r e c o r d e r is\n\nfrom the Beckman oxygen sensing electrode while the bottom t r a c e used\nthe alternate design.
