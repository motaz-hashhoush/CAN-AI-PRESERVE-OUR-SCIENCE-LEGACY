Maximum temperature and mass-loss rates are found to generally occur at altitudes between 85 and 90 km, during about 1 sec of peak heating; the survival of all particles in the 70 micron-1 mm size range is noted to be limited to those with minimal entry velocity. Virtually all of the 'cosmic spherules' of more than 70-mm diameter, as well as giant unmelted micrometeorites, are implied by the present results to be of asteroidal origin.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "89", "submissionId": 19910038955, "issn": "0019-1035", "id": "28407355f086435fa56bb587daf57908", "publicationName": "Icarus", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
