The\ninvestigation reported here has been focused on the rice plantinggrowth-harvest cycles in the Philippines through the analysis of ERTS\nimnage data. Much of what will have been learned at the completion of\nthis program will be applicable, it is felt, to rice production elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and also applicable to other agriculture in\nthose areas. Two principal objectives of the investigation are (1) to\nestablish the feasibility of extracting from ERTS imagery the areas\nwhere rice is grown, and (2) to determine those measurements on the\nimagery, and the effectiveness of the measurements, which enable the\nassessment of crop status (moisture, vigor, maturity, harvesting, etc.).\nAchieving these objectives with procedures which are cost-effective\ncan lead the way toward improved yield prediction, irrigation system\nmanagement and similar functions which are known to be important needs\nin Southeast Asia. Even a moderately accurate inventory of the total\narea in which rice is grown, as determined from analysis of ERTS image\ndata, would be of considerable value, we are told.\nIn order to achieve the objectives of this investigation, it is our\nplan to extract reliable spectral signatures from image data for the\ntest site areas, carefully correlate signatures with ground truth, and\nuse the correlation results to develop recognition algorithms. Two\ndegrees of recognition are planned:\n(1) Recognition of the areas (throughout the Philippines)\nwhere rice is grown\n(2) Assessment of rice crop or site conditions.\nIt is felt that the two-part recognition process is necessary since\nrice field conditions are so varied at any given time that signatures\nof large rice areas will be a composite of many signatures some of\nwhich could also be found in non-rice areas - thus creating an error\nproblem if a particular spectral signature recognition process is used\ngenerally. Alternatively, to exploit the spectral signatures of the\nmyriad of individual rice field conditions would seem to be an overwhelming task. But, if it can be established first that an area under\nanalysis in the imagery is definitely a rice field (and this is being\ndone through the use of the temporal variations in the signature), then\nit should be possible to extract site status information from the\nsignatures with a minimum of confusion with signatures pertaining to\nnon-rice areas.\nIt was decided to work initially with image data in transparency\nform -- color composites and black-and-white single-band imagery.\nEventually, the procedures developed will be performed using image\ndata primarily in digital tape form. But because of the complex and\ndifficult-to-recognize nature of the test sites (described in the section\nwhich follows), transparencies have been used initially. To analyze\nthe transparencies, the General Electric Multispectral Image\nExtraction Systems (GEMS) is used. GEMS is a unique and flexible\nhybrid analog-digital system for use in imagery analysis for a variety\nof applications. It involves near-real-time scanning of the imagery\nusing a 3-channel TV sensor, and includes a variety of electronic\n\n/\n\nprocessing and display functions. Importantly, GEMS is tied to a\ndigital computer. System operation can range from essentially automatic\nto an aided-manual mode, and such operation is under the control of the\noperator/analyst who observes the system displays and outputs, makes\nJudgments, and communicates with the system via a control panel and\nkeyboard.\nTest site areas where adequate ground truth data are maintained exist\nin several locations in the Philippines. To date we have confined our\nanalyses to two such areas (several sites within each area) simply to\nbecome familiar with the situation at a single location before broadening the scope of the analysis. Also, the ERTS imagery available\ncovers this selected area more extensively than other site areas.\nFinally, it is noted that the investigation is a Joint effort of\nCornell University and the General Electric Company, with key participation also by the University of the Philippines at Los Bafros, and\nby the International Rice Research Institute. The investigation is\nsupported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration under\ncontract NAS 5-21844 with Cornell University, and is identified as\nERTS Data Application Project U-160.\nLOCATING THE SITES IN THIE IMAGERY\nFigure 1 shows the type of rice region scene with which we are\nconcerned. The figure is a photograph of the GEMS color TV monitor\ndisplay of an optically zoomed portion of an ERTS color composite\ntransparency. The field-of-view shown, about 7 N4. x 7 NM., is that\nat which we usually conduct our analyses. The particular scene\nshown in the figure is near Gapan, about 50 miles north of Manila on\nthe island of Luzon. A considerable number of rice fields exist in\nthe region shown in the figure. However, the sites where ground\ntruth is available number about a dozen, and these vary in size from\n10 hectares (1000 ft. x 1000 ft.) to 260 hectares (4000 ft. x 7000\nft.). The site areas involve from 12 to 350 ERTS resolution cells.\nMost important, the sites usually appear to be spectrally nonhomogeneous for much of the growth cycle. These conditions make it\nvirtually impossible to recognize a test site by its spatial\nproperties. The site can only be located by triangulation from\nrecognizable reference points in the scene, and these occur\ninfrequently.\n\n(\n\nFor geometric reference points in the Gapan region we have chosen\nthree river bends (the same river as in the upper left of the figure)\nwhich are Just out of the scene shown in the figure. From maps of the\narea on which the test site boundaries have been marked by the ground\ntruth team, X (East-West) and Y (North-South) distances to the river\nbend reference points have been determined. These distances have then\nbeen scaled for a photograph similar to that shown in Figure 1, and\npin-holes placed in the photograph at the centroid of each site.\nFinally, using a similar scaling process, the site boundaries were\ndrawn on the photograph around each pin-hole.\n\n--\n\n1""PW-AM\n\n-,\n\n,\n\n-\n\nI\n11\n\ni\n\n11\ni\n\nI\n\n.4\n11\n\ni\nI\n\nI\n\nI\ni\n\ni\n\nSi\n\n- 40,000 Ft.

Synthesized Electronic Binary Site\nMap Superposed on TV Display of the Scene\n\n3\n\nIt was then decided to reproduce electronically in the GE4S the site\nboundaries and the area contained within these boundaries. This was\nperformed by manually entering, bincary data into the appropriate individual elements of a 500 x 500 core-storage array. The results are\nsuperposed at the analyst\'s discretion on the TV display of the scene,\nand he continues to modify the stored binary data until the result\nconforms satisfactorily to the site boundary locations as drawn on the\nphotograph. The resulting synthesized binary site map, superposed on\na display of the scene, is presented in Figure 2. The procedure, of\ncourse, is not exact, but it is felt that the boundaries are now\nwithin two or three ERTS resolution cells of where they should be.\nFor small sites, any greater deviation could seriously affect the\nusefulness of extracted signatures, particularly if rice field\nconditions are different outside the site boundary from conditions\nwithin.\nThere are two important desirable aspects of the binary site map.\nFirst, if new information indicates a boundary should be adjusted, it\nis a relatively simple matter to update the stored data. Second, once\nprepared, the binary site map is easy to use. It is stored on digital\ntape and recalled when desired. It has been used with both color\ncomposite transparencies and single-band black-and-white transparencies\nfor ERTS imagery obtained on different days. Once the binary site map\nis recalled from store and superposed on the display of the scene,\nit is a comparatively easy task to register the two. Registration\nmarks have been included in the stored binary map along the two rivers\nand their confluence in the upper left of the scene in Figure 2.\n(Those rivers, incidentally, appear to be the only useful geometric\nreferences). To facilitate the registration, there are GE14S controls\nfor translation and orientation of the displayed scene, and a control\nfor the scene magnification if a minor scale change should be necessary.\n1-D SITE SPECTRAL SIGNATURE EXTRACTION\nImagery in the form of-MSS single-spectral-band positive black-andwhite transparencies which were available as of July 1973, and in\nwhich test sites of interest were not cloud-covered, included ERTS 1\npasses on the 100th, 118th, 153rd and 189th days in orbit. Dates for\nthese passes are, respectively, 31 October, 18 November, and 23\nDecember, 1972, and 28 January 1973. These passes cover a period of\napproximately 13 weeks and span the end of the wet season harvest\n(October-November), site preparation and planting (November-December),\nand 30-60% (December-January) of the rice growth in the dry season.\nDry season harvest for these sites occurred mostly in March and April.\nSeven sites were studied - three IRRI* barrios near Gapan, and four\nPeharanda River Irrigation System (PRIS) barrios monitored by the\nUniversity of the Philippines at Los Bahos (UPLB). The UPLB sites are\nnear Gapan also and can be observed in the same frame as the IRRI\nsites. Ideally, each of the seven sites is to be examined for the\nfour passes and for the four MSS bands - 4, 5, 6 and 7. About 75% of\nthese cases were analyzed by 15 August 1973.\n\n*\n\nInternational Rice Research Institute.\n\nAs noted previously, each of the sites is relatively small**, difficult\nto locate accurately in the imagery, and invariably non-homogeneous\nspectrally. For these reasons, single-band (1-D) signatures were\nextracted from the imagery which are composite signatures for each site\nas a whole, rather than signatures for the different features within a\nsite. To do this, the binary site map was recalled from store in the\nGEMS and registered visually with each black-and-white transparency.\nNext, a radiometric calibration was performed which related the 32\nGEMS signal intensity levels (corresponding to transmission levels in\nthe transparency) with the 15 steps in the step wedge on each transparency. Then, using the binary site map and the GEMS cursor, a 1-D\nhistogram signature was extracted for each site for each of the four\npasses and usually for all four MSS bands. Each histogram is in\nnormalized form, showing the percent of total pixels in each site which\nfall within each of the 32 GEMS intensity levels. Using the radiometric calibration data, each histogram then is converted to percent\nsite pixel population falling within each half-step of the 15-step\nwedge. For each histogram, the bulk of the population occurred in two\nto seven half-steps, although the specific half-steps involved were\noften different for each case examined. Finally, for each histogram\nthe location was determined for the mean intensity value- expressed\nas a point along the 15-step gray-wedge scale (e.g., step 13.2, step\n9.8, etc.).\nResults of the above analysis are presented in Figure 3. Mean intensity\nis plotted as a function of time for each site and for each of the\nfour spectral bands. No variance data were included in the plots at\nthis time. A similar set of plots of 3-D signature information vs.\ntime is being prepared, but to date these include only two passes -31 October and 18 November.\nCOMPARISON OF 1-D SITE SIGNATURES WITH GROUND TRUTH\nGround truth information available to us consists of a large number of\nelements including site locations and boundaries, test paddy locations\nwithin sites, planting dates, plant height, stalks per unit area,\nharvest dates, plant variety, fertilizer, soil type, soil moisture or\npaddy flooding status, and yield. For initial analyses we have chosen\nto plot two quantities vs. time for each site: (1) A quantity\nindicative of plant growth or chlorophyl showing or, during the harvest\nperiod, indicative of the amount of rice plants still standing at a\ngiven date; and (2) a quantity which represents the soil moisture\nstatus or the percent of flooded paddies within the site. Actually,\nthe ground truth data for each site consists of information for 6 to\n20 paddies which are representative of the entire site (which may\ncontain 10 times or more that number of paddies).\nFor plant growth in the IRRI sites (San Nicolas, Malimba, Mahipon) the\nplotted quantity is proportional to the products of plant height and\nstalks per square meter for the test paddies, and averaged over the\n\n** There is, of course, a much larger area in which rice is grown\nin the vicinity of these sites, but ground truth for the larger\narea is not available.\n\n5\n\nLight\n\nI\n\nD\n\nA\n\nV\n\nn\n\nS A 1Y V\n\nI-\n\n1.\n\nB AN D\n\n5\n\n8\n4)\nH\n\n10\nU)\n\n4t\nu\n\nbo\n\n10\n\n11\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\nII ,\n\ni\n\n14\n\n====\nBA\nA\n\n1\n\n1\nT1,,\n\n13\n\n10/ \'31 11/18 12/5\n1 -72\n\n~4\n\n= = -Sl\n\n12!\n\nI~-\n\n15\n\nDark\n\nLight\n\nL\n\n.\n\n9\n\n12/23\nD\n\n1/10\n19\n\n1/28\n\n10)/31\n\n11/18 12/5\n\n19 7 2\n\n7 3\n\n12/23\n-- \' -~\n\n1/10\n19\n\n1/\' >A\n-7728\n-\n\n73\n\n6\n\n+ Pefiaranda A\nYPeliFranda E\nX Pefiaranda II\nVPefiaranda V\n\n8\na)\n\n9\n\nC\n\n10\n\n3\n\n4)\n\n10\n\n11\n\n11\n-II\n\n12\n\'4\n\n12\n\n13\n\n13\n\n14\n\n1.4\n\n15\n\n15\n\nDarv\n\nG10/31 11/18 12/5\n1972\n\n12/23\n\nLEGEND\n\xc2\xb7 Sarn Nicolas\no Malimba\nE Mahipon\nA Mahipon (non\nclouded)\n\n1/28\n\n1/10\n\n1/28\n19 73\n\n1972\n\nFigure 3. Mean Site Radiation vs. Time\n\n1973\n\nentire site. In the case of the UPLB sites (Pefaranda A, B, II, V),\nit is proportional to days after planting, since that is the only\npertinent information available. Planting dates vary in each paddy,\nso an average planting date is determined for each full site.\nSimilarly, harvest dates are different for each paddy, and sometimes\nthe total harvest period for a site extends over six weeks. For the\nharvest period, then, the rice plant plot for a site shows the percent\nof total paddies where rice is still growing on any given date.\nThe site water status plots are determined similarly. For the IRRI\nsites, we have been provided with test paddy information in three\ndiscrete categories: Flooded; Saturated; Dry. These conditions have\nbeen arbitrarily weighted at 100, 80 and 60, respectively, and an\naverage value for the full site at each sampling date has been computed\nand plotted. Water status information for the UPLB sites has been\nsupplied to us in the form of "flooded" or "not flooded" for each test\npaddy. Here, these conditions were weighted arbitrarily at 100 and 70,\nrespectively, and an average value for the full site has been computed\nand plotted for each sampling date.\nThe plant growth and water status plots vs. time for each of seven\nsites, determined as described above, are presented in Figure 4.\nWe can now compare the plots vs. time of single-band mean radiation\nintensity for each site with the plots vs. time of site plant growth\nand water status. First, some general observations can be made. In\npreparation for a new crop, stubble on the sites may be burned (not\nalways), the paddies are flooded and then plowed. During this period,\nsite responses in all MSS bands can be expected to drop, reaching\ntheir lowest values Just prior to planting when paddies are flooded\nbut with no plant growth. From planting to a few weeks before harvest,\nthere should be a rise in site response in all bands, particularly in\nBands 6 and 7 as the rice plants reflect increasing infrared radiation\nas they grow. About three weeks prior to harvest, the paddy flooding\nis stopped and the rice plants become drier. While we yet have no\nextracted data for confirmation, it is expected that during this period\nthere may be a further rise in the Band 4 and 5 responses and a slight\ndrop in Bands 6 and 7. During harvest a drop in site response in all\nbands is expected as bare soil becomes exposed. After the harvest is\ncomplete, but before preparation for the next crop, there is likely to\nbe a rise in a site response, particularly in Bands 4 and 5, as the\nbare soil and stubble continue a drying process.\nSPECIFIC DATA COMPARISON OBSERVATIONS\n1.\n\n2.\n(\n\nFor the time period covered, Bands 4 and 5 show about the same\ninformation, but differences among sites exhibit a greater spread\nin Band 5.\nOf the seven sites, four were essentially fully harvested by 31\nOctober, and three had an appreciable amount of rice not yet\nharvested (Mahipon-40%, Pefilaranda A-100%, Peflaranda E-50%). By\n18 November all but Pefiaranda E were essentially 100 percent\nharvested. Changes in site signatures from 31 October to 18\nNovember were examined. Infrared radiation changes were\nobserved in Band 6 since no Band 7 data for 18 November has yet\nbeen extracted.

This is consistent with the site harvest information.\n(Note that very little harvesting occurred in the Peharanda E site\nduring the period). Further, it appears that the disappearance of\nthe rice plants at harvest contributes to an appreciable drop in\nBand 6 radiation over and above any drop due to the appearance of\nwater when a site is flooded after harvest. In the cases here,\nMahipon remained dry after harvest while Peharanda A was\nharvested and flooded by 18 November.\n3.\n\nThe response in Band 6 for Petaranda II shows an increase from 31\nOctober to 18 November. This is not yet explainable since that\nsite, according to ground truth information, had been harvested\nprior to 31 October and was in a flooded condition from 28 October\nthrough November. Responses in Band 6 for sites other than\nPefiaranda II, Mahipon and Pefiaranda A changed very little during\nthe period.\n\n4.\n\nNo conclusions can yet be drawn concerning the absolute and\nrelative values of site responses in Band 6 for 31 October and 18\nNovember, and in Band 7 for 31 October. There are a large number\nof factors involved here which have not been taken into account.\n\n5.\n\nSix of the seven sites show increased radiation in Band 5 from 31\nOctober to 18 November. This remains to be explained as several\nfactors are involved. In at least one case, Mahipon, there is no\nsite flooding after harvest, so the increase probably reflects a\ndrying of the soil and stubble. In other sites where there is\nflooding after harvest, the stubble may be above the water level\nand affecting the Band 5 response. But for Pefaranda A still\nother factors may pertain since there is flooding after harvest\nbut there is no change in Band 5 response from 31 October to\n18 November. This lack of change in response is unique for the\nPefaranda A site, and the same unique situation occurs in Band 4.\n\n6.\n\nThe second (dry season, irrigated) rice crop in the 1972-73 year\nwas planted in December, so that ERTS imagery for passes on 23\nDecember and 28 January are useful for analyses of the early growth\nof this crop. Responses in Band 7 are of particular interest here.\nIt can be noted immediately that on 23 December all sites except\nMahipon exhibit a very low and similar response in Band 7. For\nthese six sites this response correlates well with the fact that\nthe six sites are either flooded or saturated and that the new\nrice crop has been planted for no more than three weeks. In two\ncases the planting has not yet taken place. The Mahipon site\nhowever, is a rainfed barrio and will receive practically no water\nduring the dry season. Therefore, no crop is planted during this\nseason, and the site can be expected to consist of bare soil,\nperhaps with some stubble and possibly some weeds, becoming drier\nand lighter in appearance as time goes on. This is borne out by\nthe Band 7 response for Mahipon: brighter than all other sites on\n23 December, and increasing in brightness between 23 December and\n28 January.\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 January it is noted in Band 7 that the responses for all\nsites except Mahipon have increased to nearly the same as, or\ngreater than, the response for Mahipon. Since the six sites are\neither 100 percent flooded or nearly so at this time, the conclusion is that the rice plant growth has reached the stage where\nmuch of the standing water is masked from satellite view by the\nplants, or that the infrared reflection from the plants offsets\nthe poor reflection from the water. This correlates well with\nthe fact that rice plant growth in the six sites is four to\neight weeks (30-60%) along in the growing period.\n\n8.\n\nAn additional observation pertaining to the Band 7 site responses\nis that these responses on 28 January have increased to about the\nlevel which they exhibited on 31 October, harvest time. And,\nsince further plant growth is yet to come, a still higher Band 7\nresponse is expected for the weeks ahead. It is noted also that\nBand 7 responses at 28 January are beginning to show a spread\namong the sites. Peflaranda A and E, the sites with the youngest\ngrowth (4 weeks), exhibit the lowest responses, as would be\nexpected.\n\n9.\n\nResponses in Band 5 for 28 January appear to support the\nconclusions reached in the analysis of Band 7 data. That is, the\nMahipon site involves bare soil becoming dry, while the other\nsites contain rice plants with growth beginning to mask portions\nof the standing water. Increases in radiation in Band 5 from 23\nDecember to 28 January can be expected and are observed for all\nsites. However, for all sites other than Mahipon the reflected\nradiation falls below that for Mahipon on both 23 December and\n28 January. This correlates on 23 December with an expected\nhigher Band 5 response for bare, drying soil compared to essentially\nnon-vegetated, flooded paddies. Further it correlates on 28\nJanuary with an expected higher Band 5 response for still drier\nbare soil vs. the relatively low "red" reflectance of the rice\nplants now in growth.\n3-D SITE SPECTRAL SIGNATURE EXTRACTION\n\nFrom analysis results to date it appears that it will be desirable,\nand perhaps essential, to extract from the image data three-spectralband (i.e., 3-D) site signatures in order to meet program objectives.\nThe spectral radiation is not homogeneous within any site at any time,\nexcept possibly if all paddies in a site are flooded at the same time\nprior to planting. Many of these non-homogeneities, however, contribute\nin only a small way to the overall site signature. Yet it will be\nimportant to detect these differences if useful information is to be\nextracted for such purposes as yield prediction and as an aid in\nirrigation management. This must be accomplished in the presence of\nvariability conditions such as different plant varieties in different\npaddies, different soils and fertilizer treatments and a spread in\nplanting dates for the paddies. Possibly, the 1-D signatures will be\nadequate for site recognition, but site status assessment is likely to\nbe difficult unless 3-D signatures are employed. This was confirmed\nin one case in a signature extraction -- signature application\nexperiment. Using GEMS, a 1-D signature was extracted from a Band 7\n\nblack-and-white transparency at a site where rice was growing. That\nsignature then was applied to the region containing the remaining sites,\nwith the intent to enhance (as observed on the GEMS TV monitor) those\nareas where a similar signature existed. Generally, the proper portions\nof other sites were enhanced, but there was considerable additional\nenhancement of many site areas where different rice conditions were\nknown to exist. When the process was repeated using a color composite\ntransparency (same sites and satellite pass) and a 3-D signature\nextraction, the resulting enhancement was of a finer grain and more\nprecisely and accurately located.\nAs of 15 August 1973 only two color composite transparencies have been\navailable, those for passes over the sites on 31 October and 18\nNovember. Results in these two cases using 3-D signatures appear\npromising, but tests with additional frames are necessary, of course.\nA radiometric calibration is performed, similar to the 1-D case, in\nwhich the 32 GEMS-measured intensity levels in each of three bands are\n\nrelated to the steps in the 15-step gray wedge in the color composite\ntransparency. In an attempt to keep signatures as simple as possible\nyet sufficiently detailed to do the Job, the 32 GEMS-measured intensity\nlevels in each of three bands were combined so as to produce only five\nlarger increments of six GEMS levels each. Usually this consisted of\nGEMS levels 3-8 for the first increment, levels 9-14 for the second\nincrement, etc. The result is a 5 X 5 X 5 - 125-cell 3-D color space,\nwhich is illustrated in Figure 5. An extracted 3-D signature in this\nsystem consists of the percent of total pixels for the scene area of\ninterest which fall within each of the 125 color cells. Each color\ncell is designated by its quantized location along the three spectral\naxes, with larger numbers referring to a higher radiation level in that\nchannel. For example, cell 1-3-5 corresponds to radiation which is\nsimultaneously at the lowest level in channel 1, at the middle level\nin channel 2, and at the brightest level in channel 3. In our system,\nchannel 1 pertains to "green" in the transparency, channel 2 to\n"blue" and channel 3 to "red". In turn, these channels pertain to the\nMSS spectral bands in accordance with the preparation of the color\ncomposite -- usually blue for MSS Band 4, green for Band 5 and red for\nBand 7. Figure 5 shows the location of cell 4-4-3.\n3-D site histogram signatures are extracted in a manner similar to that\nfor 1-D signature extraction. The binary site map is recalled from\nstore and registered visually with the color transparency. Using the\n\nGEMS cursor to define which site in the site map is of interest, that\ndesignated portion of the site map is used to gate out a 3-D\nsignature which is recorded on tape and subsequently printed out by\nthe GEMS computer. 3-D histogram extraction has been performed for:\n(1) The same site and same frame, but on different analysis\ndays\n(2) Different sites, but the same frame, and on the same and\ndifferent analysis days\n(3) The same site, but two different frames (two satellite passes).\n\n,//\n\nBlue\n\n/fRadiation\n\n0\n4J\n\ngo\nfu\n\n~1)\n\nstep 10\n\nstep 12\n\nstep 13\n\nstep 15\nGreen Radiation\n\nFIGURE 5.\n\nf\n\n125 Cell 3-D Color Space\n\nResults to date from (1) and (2) indicate that 3-D histograms are\nrepeatable to an acceptable degree and that there are detectable\ndifferences in the 3-D signatures for different sites (where different\nconditions prevail). Results from (3), although limited because only\ntwo frames have so far been available, indicate that a number of\nchanges in site conditions between two dates are detectable via the\n3-D signatures extracted from the different frames. This will be\ndescribed further in the section which follows. An illustration of\na portion of the results for (1), (2) and (3) above is given in\nFigure 6.\nAs another check on the 3-D histogram signatures, 3-D signatures for\nthree sites in one frame were converted to three sets of three 1-D\nsignatures. These compared favorably (within a half-step) with the\n1-D signatures for the same sites and frame which were extracted from\nthe black-and-white single-band transparencies.\nSYNTHESIS OF 3-D SITE FEATURE SIGNATURES\n\nIt was mentioned previously that at most times the sites are\nspectrally non-homogeneous due to varying conditions from paddy to\npaddy within each site. At the present time we have not sub-divided\nthe ground truth information to show where different paddy conditions\nare located within the overall site. This will be done in the future.\nHowever, in some cases it may be difficult to correlate these conditions with extracted signature data because of the extreme difficulty\nin locating in the imagery precisely where the conditions occur.\nPosition accuracies in the order of two ERTS resolution cells can be\ninvolved.\nIn spite of the above situation, an initial approach has been made\ntoward synthesizing 3-D signatures for features (i.e., conditions)\nwithin a site, as opposed to a signature for an overall site. This\nwas done as follows. The color composite for 31 October was used in\nGEMS, and a zoomed portion encompassing the test site region was displayed in color on the GEMS TV monitor in essentially the same colors\nas exist in the transparency. Upon study of the monitor display it\nbecame apparent that seven frequently occurring colors could be distinguished visually: Dark blue, blue, bluish pink, dark red, red,\npink and light beige. (White, such as in clouds, and black, such as\nin ocean water or cloud shadows, also are distinguishable, of course).\nThese seven colors will change with adjustments in the color display\nor with a different color composite preparation, but seven distinguishable colors will still exist except in extreme cases.\nFurther study of the color display in conjunction with ground truth\ninformation led to an estimated association of each color with a\ncertain scene condition. This association, listed below, remains to\nbe fully verified, but is believed to be a satisfactory first\napproximation:\n\n/3\n\n3-D HISTOGRAM\nPLOT FOR\nMALIMBA PASS\n10/31/72\nANALYSIS\n6/15/73\n,\n\n/f\n\nf 7\n\n~/~~~7~~\n5~4# 4t\n\n3\n\nZ4\n\n-\n\nr\n\n-,-"\'4\n\nGREEN\n=1\n\nL5\n\nBLUE\n{-\n\nG-B-R\nColor\nCell\n1-2-1\n1-2-2\n1-3-1\n1-3-2\n2-2-1\n2-2-2\n2-2-3\n2-3-1\n2-3-2\n2-3-3\n2-3-4\n2-4-1\n2-4-2\n2-4-3\n2-4-4\n3-3-4\n3-4-1\n3-4-2\n3-4-3\n3-4-4\n3-4-5\n3-5-1\n3-5-3\n4-4-4\n4-4-5\n4-5-5\n\nMalimba\n\nPass\n10/31/72\nAnalysis\n6/15/73\n\nPass\n10/31/72\nAnalysis\n6/21/73\n\nPass\n11/18/72\nAnalysis\n8/7/73\n\nSan\nNicolas\nPass\n10/31/72\nAnalysis\n6/21/73\n\n12%\n12\n3%\n3\n\n15%\n2\n7\n\n14%\n3\n7\n\n7\n7\n7\n2\n\n3\n25\n6\n12\n6\n3\n\n3\n2\n2\n3\n\n3\n21\n5\n\n6\n21\n5\n6\n7\n30\n15\n\n3\n11\n21\n\n3\n28\n28\n6\n\n3\n3\n\n3\n3\n\nFIGURE 6.\n\n3-D HISTOGRAM DATA\n\nColor in the Color Composite\nfor MSS Bands 4, 5, 7\n\nScene Feature in Rice Region\n(Rice Field Condition)\n\nDark Blue\n\n- Layer of water over bare soil,\nor saturated bare soil\n\nBlue\n\n- Moist, bare soil\n\nBluish Pink\n\n- Moist, bare soil with rice\nstubble or weeds\n\nDark Red\n\n- Growing rice, with some standing\nwater or saturated soil visible\n\nRed\n\n- Growing rice - no moisture stress\n\nPink\n\n-\n\nLight Beige\n\n- Growing rice - drier\n\nGrowing rice - nearing maturity\n\nNext, the GEMS cursor was placed successively over small areas in the\ndisplayed image where each of the seven colors appeared to exist\nhomogeneously. 3-D signatures were then extracted, and the results were\nused to identify which of the 125 color cells in the 5 X 5 X 5 color\nspace corresponded to each of the seven colors in the color composite\ntransparency. For example, "Dark Red" involves color cells 1-1-2,\n1-2-2, 1-2-3, and 1-3-3. Actually, the color cell identification\nprocess was an iterative one, using only the color composite for 31\nOctober and gradually taking site ground truth information for 31\nOctober into account. Eventually, about one-third of the 125 color\ncells were labeled in this manner.\nFinally, the 3-D histogram site signatures for the seven sites on 31\nOctober and 18 November were matched against the labeled color-space\ncells. If the site signature showed 20 percent of the total pixels\nfor the site fell within color cells 1-1-2, 1-2-2, 1-2-3, and 1-3-3,\nthen 20 percent of the site was considered to be "dark red" or\ninvolving "growing rice with some water visible". The composition of\neach of the seven sites was thus specified in percentages of each of\nthe seven described (estimated) rice field conditions. This was done\nfor the 31 October and the 18 November color composite imagery.\nResults are presented in Figure 7. It is important to note, however,\nthat the training (color cell labeling, or synthesis of rice field\nfeature signatures) was accomplished using only the 31 October imagery.\nThe synthesized feature signatures were applied to the 31 October\nimage data as a check on the synthesis, and to the 18 November image\ndata for an initial look at the adequacy of that synthesis.\n\na)\n\nGro wing Rice\n\n*H Q\n\n0\n\nO :3\nV) 4.

This corresponds to the ground truth\nsituation. Of these four sites, Malimba has the greatest percentage\nof harvested area, and there is good correlation concerning this.\nThe extracted data show San Nicolas and Pefaranda II and V as\ncontaining essentially all bare soil (with varying degrees of\n\nmoisture, stubble or weeds). This, too, checks with ground truth\ninformation which shows these sites as recently 100-percent\nharvested.\nFor 18 November, the extracted data show San Nicolas and Petaranda\nII and V as continuing to be composed of nearly 100-percent bare soil\n(harvested).\n\ncategory.\n\nPeftaranda A also is indicated as falling in this\n\nThese situations are confirmed by ground truth.\n\nThe\n\ncorrelation of extracted data with ground truth for Malimba, Mahipon\nand Pefiaranda E, however, is fairly good but does involve some\nsituations which are not yet explainable. Malimba should be fully\nharvested, but the extracted data indicates 22% of the site still\ncontains growing rice. Mahipon presumably has only 5% unharvested\nrice remaining, but extracted data indicate 40%. Finally, Pefiaranda\nE should have about 25% unharvested rice remaining, but extracted\ndata indicates this figure is 5%.\nThese first-cut results are encouraging, but a refinement of the\nrice-field feature signatures and a re-check of ground truth data\n\nis indicated. And, of course, the feature signatures need to be\ntested and refined using imagery for additional passes over the sites.\nThere is evidence that the feature signatures can be refined as\ndesired. For example, the 3-D site histogram signatures for\nPelaranda A and E for 31 October and 18 November were re-examined.\nHistograms for both sites showed, as expected, a shift to the darker\ncolor cells from 31 October to 18 November, but Peharanda E appeared\n\nto have the greater percent pixel population in color cells in the\nvicinity of those now labeled as "red". Thus, a further iteration\nof the rice-field feature signature synthesis (a refinement in the\nlabeling of the 3-D color cells) could well result in a more accurate\nindication from extracted data of the percent unharvested rice in the\nPetaranda E site on 18 November.\n\nJ\n\n7\n\nSUMMARY AND PROJECTION\n\nOne of the goals in the overall investigation is to arrive at a basis\nfor recognition in the image data of areas where rice is grown, and\ntemporal patterns of spectral signatures are a key element in the\napproach. In proceeding toward the goal, the correlation with ground\ntruth of extracted 1-D site signatures, and the correlation with ground\ntruth of initial 3-D algorithms for the recognition of site composition,\nhave been encouraging, although some inconsistencies in the correlation\nremain to be resolved. It is necessary to extend the image data\nanalysis through full wet and dry season growing cycles, and to\ninclude more diversity in the test sites which are analyzed.\nA rice field recognition-process using satellite imagery for the\nentire Philippines may not have to be a fully automatic process. It\nwould consist of a heavy initial effort plus a small periodic updating\nactivity. (Changes in rice-field boundaries, or the conversion of a\nrice field to another use, are infrequent). 1-D signatures, plus good\nposition location procedures, may be adequate for the rice field\nrecognition.\nRice field status assessment using satellite imagery involves\naccounting for many complex factors. Further, in an operational\nsituation, the assessment must be performed periodically and rapidly,\nif results are to be useful for irrigation management, yield prediction\nand similar functions. This essentially dictates a heavily automated\nassessment procedure, very likely based on the use of 3-D signature\ndata. For reasons previously described, image data in the form of\ncolor and black-and-white transparencies are employed in the present\nanalysis. But an operational procedure very likely would be based on\nthe use of digital image data on tape.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors express their appreciation to Dr. T. Wickham and Prof.\nS.
