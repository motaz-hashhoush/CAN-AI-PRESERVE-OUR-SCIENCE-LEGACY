b'COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFF\n\nGiving E-Commerce a Boost\n\nI\n\nmagine walking into a store and having all\nyour favorite items, or things you buy\nregularly, neatly organized right in front of you\nrather than having to search up and down the aisles\nwondering why dish soaps and laundry detergent\nare not kept together. Now imagine walking into\nthat store via the Internet on your computer. Such\nstores are becoming available online and are being\npowered by technology developed by a former\nNASA employee who transferred the knowledge\nand skills he acquired at NASA into a successful\nentrepreneurial endeavor, Blue Martini Software.\nBlue Martini president Monte Zweben used his\nnine years at Ames Research Center to develop ideas\non how to use artificial intelligence for automated\nscheduling and planning. As the Deputy Branch Chief\nof the NASA Ames Artificial Intelligence Branch,\nZweben oversaw research in machine learning and\ndata mining. NASA implemented the technology to\nautomate the maintenance and refurbishment on the\nspace shuttles at savings of $4 million per year.\nBlue Martini provides software to companies\nseeking to personalize their products to each individual customer. Many of the methods developed and\nstudied during the research at Ames are useful for\nmining clickstream and purchasing behavior, and\nsimilar techniques are now used in Blue Martini\xe2\x80\x99s\napplications.\nBlue Martini\xe2\x80\x99s primary product is its Customer\nInteraction System, which can be used to automatically tailor an online catalog to a shopper\xe2\x80\x99s interest or\npast purchase history. The software allows merchants\nto spot trends in buying patterns and correspondingly\nchange its website to leverage those trends.\nThe merchant can attach characteristics to a target\nmarket and then apply those same descriptors to a\nrange of products so that visitors to the website are\nshown products in which they are most likely to have\nan interest. Blue Martini Software then provides\nanalysis and reports to merchants, which allow them\nto determine optimal cross-sells, pricing, and promotions. This ability combines dynamic merchandising\nand targeted selling.\nBlue Martini Software also offers flexible functions to provide a variety of service programs such as\n\nPortable devices modified with bar code readers allow\nsalespeople to access detailed information about\nprevious purchasing history or related products that\ncompliment the item being purchased using Blue\nMartini databases accessed through the Internet.\n\nfrequent shopper rewards, gift registries, order\nstatus, and a direct link to customer service.\nThe software driving all this is built on a threetier architecture that is easily expandable across\nservers, secure from unauthorized access to\ncustomer data, and uses load balancing to optimize\nresponse time and eliminate crashed servers from\nthe pool to ensure no-delay shopping. The Customer Interaction System can manage millions of\ndistinct customers and process millions of page or\ncatalog views per day.\nThe advantage of Blue Martini comes not just\nfrom the personalization capabilities of the software, but also teaches its customers how to personalize. The user-friendly interface is designed using\nintuitive graphics so that business can actually\nmake Blue Martini Software a powerful tool that\ndelivers on its promise.\nSo far, Blue Martini has sold its system to a\nmajor clothing maker and a leading motorcycle\nmanufacturer, and has several other large merchandisers lined up. It is this kind of leading edge\napproach that has Blue Martini positioned to\nbecome a market leader in providing e-commerce\nservices to companies.\nNASA SPINOFF 2000\n\n69\n\n'
