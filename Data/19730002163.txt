This\nreport covers the work performed from contract go-ahead to contract completion\non 15 September 1972. Under the terms of the contract, analysis programs were\nto be updated (Task I), rigid body dynamic and control analyses were to be\nperformed (Task II), and flexible body stability and control analyses were to\nbe performed (Task III). A brief summary of these studies, which have been\nreported to MSC/GCD in 49 interim reports (listed in the references) is given\nin the following paragraphs. ,\nTask I Summary - Update of Analysis Programs\nInitially, mathematical models were developed for the MSC Space Shuttle\nFunctional simulator to provide a launch phase boost to staging simulation\nequivalent to the Boeing-developed Rigid Body Boost Simulation (RIBBS).\nThese models were programmed by MSC C&AD into the Space Shuttle Functional\nSimulator (SSFS) developed by the Guidance and Control Division. The SSFS\nfirst stage simulation was checked out jointly by MSC and Boeing personnel.\nIn order to provide analysis capability from liftoff through orbit insertion,\nseveral additional models not already in RIBBS were developed for SSFS. These\nmodels were: targeting to orbit; active guidance; a three degree of freedom\nupper stage to orbit; and calculation of orbital parameters. During the\ncourse of the model development, programming, and checkout of SSFS, numerous\nmodifications were made to the RIBBS program as a result of updated analysis\nrequirements in Task II. SSFS was then updated to meet these additional\nanalysis capability requirements by adding: trajectory shaping and control\ngain calculations; baseline control system, multistage guidance; and liftoff\nstate vector calculations.\nPoint time stability analysis equations were also developed during Task I\nand programmed into the M DELTA Program.\nAll of the math models which were developed for the SSFS have been updated\nand are included in this final report.\n\nTask II Summary - Rigid Body Dynamics and Control Analysis\nThe NR/GD 161B/B9T delta wing booster/delta wing orbiter configuration was\nextensively analyzed during the first half of the contract. Brief studies\nwere performed on the 036B/280 inch solid rocket motor series burn configuration\nand the 040A/LOX propane series burn configuration using liquid injection thrust\nvector control. In February 1972 studies.were initiated on parallel burn\ndual solid rocket motor (SRM) configurations.\n.... .\nLiftoff studies of the 040C/SRM configuration revealed that 0.25\xc2\xb0 SRM.misalignments and ground winds were satisfactorily controllable. However, 0.5\xc2\xb0\nmisalignments caused thrust torques exceeding the TVC roll control authority.\nOrbiter engine out analysis demonstrated that the SRMS must be oriented to\nthrust nearly through the liftoff eg or the vehicle would be uncontrollable -\'\nin event of an orbiter engine failure. Inflight analysis of the 040C/SRM\nshowed that the available roll torque was insufficient to maintain a .fixed\nroll attitude in crosswinds, so studies of active roll control to minimize\nsideslip were conducted.\nThe configuration was changed to the MSC049 Model and.control system development was continued. The resulting control system is based on a gravity turn\ntrajectory so the vehicle can roll and keep trajectory dispersions to a\nminimum. The roll control problem is minimized by sensing sideslip and\nactively rolling its\' tail into the wind. Results of several hundred simulated\nflights to orbit indicated that this control system can handle any wind\nconditions as long as SRM misalignments are constrained within 0.25 degrees.\nAerodynamic loads were automatically minimized without load relief techniques,\nand weight to orbit was maintained within a few thousand pounds of the nominal\nno-wind value for all cases.\nBecause of the 0.25 degree alignment constraint studies of trim gimballing\nof the SRMS were also performed. It was determined that gimballing the SRMS\n+_ two degrees at a rate limited to 0.3 degrees/second not only permitted\nmisalignments greater than one degree but also improved wind response of\nthe vehicle.\n\n:\n\nTask III Summary - Flexible Body Stability and Control Analysis\nFlexible body models were developed and programmed into the space shuttle\nfunctional simulator so that flexible body analysis can be initiated as\nsoon as bending data becomes available. The flexible body program uses\na generalized modal approach to bending which represents the elastic response\nby standard normal modal equations with viscous damping. Included are models\nfor distributed aerodynamic forces and moments, and thrust forces and moments\nto account for bending effects as well as the tail wags dog contribution to\nbending. The vibration model sums all the forces and moments acting on each\nof the equivalent mass points and for a given mode numerically integrates\nthe sum with a second order differential equation in modal displacement.\n\n2.0\n\nTask I - Update of Analysis Programs\n\nThe three major programs which were included as part of the updating procedure\nof this task were the Space Shuttle Functional Simulator (SSFS), Rigid Body\nBoost Simulation (RIBBS), and Matrix Differential Equation Linear Transform\nAnalysis (MDELTA). SSFS was updated with mathematical models to provide a\nlaunch phase simulation for the MSC Guidance and Control Division. All of\nthe models which were developed during this contract period have been updated\nto the current configuration and are. presented in Section 2.1. The Boeing\nRIBBS program was used for analysis of shuttle during the development of\nSSFS. RIBBS was also updated with a new guidance model and other modifications\nas explained in Section 2.2. The Boeing MDELTA program was modified for use\nin point time stability analysis. This is mentioned in Section 2.3. Also\nincluded in Section 2.4 is a discussion of the development of the boost\nLinear Tangent Guidance (LTG) equations.\n\n2.1\n\nSpace Shuttle Functional Simulator (SSFS) Math Models\n\nRigid body mathematical models were prepared and delivered to MSC Guidance\nand Control Division to provide the Space Shuttle Functional Simulator (SSFS)\nwith the same capability as the Boeing Rigid Body Boost Simulation (RIBBS).\nThese models which were originally presented in References 1 and 2 include:\nboost polynomial guidance; mass properties thrust; thrust vector control;\nrigid body 6 DOF equations of motion; aerodynamics;.RCS; and atmosphere\nmodels. These models were programmed by Lockheed Electronics Corporation .\n(LEC) and jointly checked out by LEG and Boeing by making comparison runs\non RIBBS and SSFS. References 3 and 4 describe the comparison results.\nSlight differences were observed due to some fundamental program structure\ndifferences and updated gravity and atmosphere models in SSFS. The final\ncheckout used design shear and gust winds to verify the short period dynamics\nand included detailed examination of the computer programming to assure that\nthe differences that remained after debugging were not the result of coding\nerrors. Additional confidence was gained by duplicating some of the more\ncomplex transformations and equation sets on the Boeing computers (using the\nBoeing computer service remote terminals) and.verifying them using known\ninput-output data sets.\n...\nSeveral additional new models were also developed and delivered to MSC.\nThese include orbit .insertion targeting, active guidance, three degree of\nfreedom upper stage to orbit equations of motion, orbital parameters,\ninitial state vector, hinge moment calculations, control gains calculations,\nand trajectory shaping. These models were detailed in References 5 - 1 1 .\nThese models were also programmed by LEC and comparisons of results with\nexisting simulation data was favorable. The control gains and trajectory\nshaping equations were verified, .as shown in References 12 and 13, by\ncomparison with similar equations programmed into the RIBBS program.\nThe following subsections give a complete description of the current math\nmodels developed during this contract and incorporated in the Space Shuttle\nFunction Simulator. The baseline control system of Reference 14 that was\naccepted for inclusion in the MSC Guidance and Control Equations Document\n"MSC-04217 Revision B" has since been updated to include sideslip feedback and\ngimballed solid rocket motors as presented in paragraph 2.1.5.\n\n2.1.1\n\nAERO\n\n(Aerodynamics)\n\n2.1.1.1\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThis model calculates the latitude and longitude of the vehicle\nposition, the contribution to velocity due to wind speed and\ndirection, flight path angle, Mach number, dynamic pressure,\nangle of attack and angle of sideslip.

In the course of these analyses a number of\nimprovements and modifications were incorporated into the RIBBS simulation.\nThese improvements were subsequently incorporated in SSFS. Some of the\nimprovements were trajectory shaping,, control gain calculation and state\nvector calculation subroutines.\nRIBBS was used extensively for analysis of the LOX-propane configuration\nwhich used liquid injection thrust vector control. For this study the thrust\nvector control scheme in RIBBS was revised to take out engine gimbals and\nadd thrust vectoring by use of propane injection. The multi-stage guidance\nsystem described in Reference 15 was also initially originated and checked\nout in the RIBBS program. RIBBS was also modified to provide plotting and\nprintout capabilities in case of any type of termination during a trajectory\nrun, by means of a subroutine called RESTART.\n\n10]\n\n-\n\n2.3\n\n\' \xe2\x80\xa2 *\xe2\x80\xa2 -y ^~ti-^-- \'" \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPOINT TIME STABILITY ANALYSIS USING MDELTA\n\nThe Boeing developed MDELTA program was used to perform point time\nstability analysis of pitch and lateral directional vehicle axes. The\nMDELTA program was modified to output Bode (magnitude and phase vs.\nfrequency) plots and Nichols (magnitude vs. phase) plots. These plots\nare extremely helpful for quick analysis in determining stability\ncharacteristics of a system.\n2.3.1\n\nPITCH PLANE DYNAMICS\n\nA derivation and discussion of the pitch axis dynamic model is found in\nReference 16.

Anyone\nfamiliar with the IGM can follow through the development term by term\nand see that LTG could be considered as an improved and somewhat simplified IGM. It can also be shown that E Guidance, the Apollo lunar ascent\nguidance, is a special case of the generalized derivation presented in\nSection 2.4.1. The guidance law presented in Section 9.4.2 of Reference 54\nis a modified form of Apollo E Guidance.\nLTG is characterized by its utilization of the linear tangent steering\nlaw resulting from application of classical optimization theory. The\nderivation of LTG is presented in this Section. The generalized form\n" "\xe2\x80\xa2\'./\xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\xa2\nof the steering commands is shown in Section 2.4.1 without defining the\n.specific form, of the. terminal position and velocity vectors and the gravity\nmodel. (The major difference between IGM and E Guidance is the difference\nin the form of the terminal position and velocity vectors and the gravity\nmodel.) A simple second order gravity model is derived in Section 2.4.1Implementation of the gravity model is incorporated in the equation flow\nchart os Section 2.1.7. In order to desmonstrate the flexibility of LTG to\napplications other than boost, it is also shown in Section 2.4.1 how to use the\nscheme to provide a throttle command for rendezvous.\nA computational flow of multi-stage guidance equations, as implemented in\nRIBBS (Boeing Rigid Body Boost Simulation Program), is shown in Section 2.1.7.\nMulti-stage guidance was implemented for two reasons: (1) to accommodate\na constant acceleration phase as well as a constant thrust phase in the\norbiter and (2) to enable active guidance turn on during booster flight.\nLinear tangent IGM type guidance was implemented in RIBBS rather than E\nGuidance because E Guidance, as implemented in the MSC/GCD Space Shuttle\nFunctional Simulator, was derived for a one stage vehicle and, therefore,\ncannot tolerate a discontinuity in acceleration. The main simplifying\n\n113\n\n2.4\n\nLINEAR TANGENT GUIDANCE LAW (LTG) DEVELOPMENT (Continued)\n\nassumption of E Guidance is that the effective gravity (gravity plus\ncentrifugal acceleration) can be represented as the product of thrust\nacceleration and a linear function of burn time. Effective gravity is\ncontinuous with time and decreases with the square of the velocity.\nTherefore, the E Guidance effective gravity assumption is not very accurate for a constant acceleration burn, since this means that effective\ngravity is approximated by a linear function of time (whereas it is\nactually a higher order function). However, E Guidance is quite accurate for a one-stage constant thrust burn, since the acceleration has a\nhigher order shape. LTG, as shown in Section 2.1.7, eliminates these\nrestricting assumptions.\n2,4.1\n\nDERIVATION OF GUIDANCE LAW\n\nWe will consider vacuum flight equations of motion of a one-stage vehicle\nin developing the basic LTG equations. In a general derivation it is not\nnecessary to specify the form of (F/m), the thrust acceleration (e.g.,\nF/m can be constant or thrust and mass flow rate can be constant). It\nis only necessary to assume that F/m is a time function that can be\nintegrated in closed form. Also, it will be seen that implementing\nmulti-stage guidance is simply a matter of expanding the closed form\nintegrals of F/m. It is also sufficient to assume that the gravity\nvector can be approximated by a time function that can be integrated in\nclosed form.\n\n114\n\n2.4.1\n\nDERIVATION OF GUIDANCE LAW\n\n(Continued)\n\nThe following definitions are used in the analysis of this section.\nR\n\nTotal inertia! acceleration vector\n\n(F/m)\n\nThrust to mass ratio\n\ng\n\nGravitational acceleration vector\n\n" *\nXp\n\n\' \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\n.\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .\xe2\x80\xa2 \' \xe2\x80\xa2\nUnit vector of Euler-Lagrange multipliers defining .thrust\n\n.\n\ndirection\nV\n\nInertial velocity vector\n\nVT\n\nDesired terminal velocity vector\n\nVGO\n\n\' Velocity-to-go (to be gained by thrust)\n\nR^\n\nInertial radius vector\n\nRj\n\nDesired terminal radius vector\n\nR~Q\n\nDistance-to-go (to be gained by thrcist.)\n\nT~0\n\nTime-to-go (burn time plus coast time)\n\nov\n\nCommanded inertia! pitch angle\n\n\\ti\n\nCommanded inertia! yaw angle \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2".".\n.\n\nThe following integrals are defined assuming that TGQ is given.\nIt is sufficient here to assume that closed form integrals exist\nfor these quantities.

However, the X and Z axis of the guidance\ncoordinate system implemented in Section 2.2 lie in the desired orbital\nplane. Therefore, the average y for gravity velocity losses is 1/3.\nof the way from the desired orbital plane to local position. In the\norbital coordinate system y^ = 0, so y~ is used instead of y,-, Xy\nis used for the average radial distance.\nIn summary, the gravity model is constructed by defining the average\nradius vector for velocity losses and the average radius vector for\ndistance losses in terms of the terminal radius vector. As implemented\nin Section 2.1.7,tHe. actual terminal radius vector is used instead of\nusing approximations such as equation 29, Equation 29 is used only, to\nderive the factors 1/3, (FQ + i)/3, 1/2, and (2Fg.+ l)/6 as shown in.\nSection 2.1.7.\n.\n\xc2\xbb\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n9\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\nInspection of F~ = 2/(2 + Z-J shows that FG ranges from 0 to 1/2 as\nZ ranges from 0 to Z-p.

However, if rendezvous\nwith a target vehicle is being performed, the position and velocity\nof the target are functions of the burn time of the vehicle performing\nrendezvous, and an iteration is involved. But for simplicity the example\ngiven here can be thought of as lunar descent to a hover point over a given\nlanding site. In this case the desired terminal position is a given\naltitude over the landing site and the desired terminal velocity magnitude is zero with respect to the landing site.\nWe will assume that the vehicle propulsion system has a constant specific\nimpulse (or exhaust velocity) and that when closed-loop throttling begins\na constant thrust level is desired for achieving the terminal conditions.\n(It is even easier to compute a constant acceleration command).\nEquations 12 and 13 are used to compute the time-to-go and throttle\ncommand, i.e.,\n12) L = Vrn\nbU\n\nand\n\nis) s = A.RuU .\npn\nThe quantities in the above equations are functions of TV,.; however, it\nwill be assumed that the equations are recycled through until T\xe2\x84\xa2 stops\nchanging (as in the range free mode shown in Section 2.1.7).

Design winds were synthesized using the techniques described\nin NASA Terrestrial Environment documents (1969 and 1971), References 20\nand 21, respectively. The differences between these references were found\nto be insignificant to the studies as discussed in Reference 22. The\nNR-GD 161B/B9T Delta Wing Booster/Delta Wing Orbiter and the MSC 036B/280\ninch SRM series burn configuration were analyzed during the first half of\nthe contract period and reported in the semi-annual report (Reference 23).\nSince the semi-annual report, the MSC 040A/LOX propane liquid injectant\nTVC configuration and the parallel burn dual SRM configurations MSC 040\nand MSC 049 have been analyzed. These studies are summarized in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n161B/B9T\nA series of studies (reported in References 24 through 35) were performed\nto determine the control requirements of a Delta Wing Booster/Delta Wing\nOrbiter, typified by the NR-GD 161B/B9T. The unsymmetrical aerodynamic and\nmass characteristics of this type of piggyback configuration necessitated\ndevelopment of analytical techniques for trajectory shaping and control gain\ncalculations. Because thrust vector control is inadequate to prevent large\nroll errors, several roll control techniques were investigated, including:\nlimiting roll engine commands to permit large roll angles without loss of\npitch and-yaw control; aerodynamic roll control; and yawing to decrease the\naerodynamic rolling moment.\nIn the pitch plane, wind response studies revealed that drift minimum\ncontrol can reduce trajectory dispersions about 65% as compared with a\nfixed gain attitude control law. The aerodynamic forces and moments\nwere 10% higher using drift minimum but the force was still 1/3 less than .\nthe booster would experience during a 5g entry. The engine deflection\n\n143\n\n3.0 Continued\nrequirement was approximately \xc2\xb17.5 degrees, about half of which is due to\nwinds and the other half required to control eg travel and no wind aerodynamics. For crosswind control, ailerons were used during the high\n-dynamic pressure region with thrust vector control only near lift-off and\nafter 100 seconds of flight. Yawing away from the wind may also be useful\nfor this configuration though the method of implementation would require\nadditional study. Yawing into the wind tended to increase rather than\ndecrease control requirements.\n036B/280 SRM\n\nThe 036B/280 inch SRM booster series burn launch configuration was analyzed\nvery briefly and found to be easily controlled in winds. Roll control used\nthe orbiter rudder. Reference 36 contains the results of this analysis.\n040A/LOX Propane\n\nIn February, 1972, the 040A/LOX propane liquid injectant TVC configuration\nwas loaded into the SSFS Program as documented in Reference 37. A brief\nwind response study was performed, and it was determined (References 38\nand 39) that liqu.id injectant requirements could be reduced from 135,000\npounds to 60,000 pounds by incorporating aerodynamic roll control. An\nadditional study of load relief control was performed (Reference 40), and\nit was shown that additional injectant savings are possible by adjusting\nthe slopes of the transition ramps from attitude control to load relief\nand back to attitude control.\n\n144\n\n3.1 SRM/040C CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS\n\nThe SRM/040C configuration defined in Reference 41 was loaded into the SSFS,\nand both lift-off and inflight analyses were conducted. The lift-off\ninvestigation is described in Reference 42. The results of 135 flight\nsimulations were reported together with the conclusions obtained from the\ninvestigation. Two modifications of the standard vehicle were considered\nusing equations presented in Reference 43. The first involved tilting\nthe SRM engines while the second translated and tilted the SRM engines.\nThe results showed that all three configurations were flyable with reasonable\nvalues of thrust misalignment and unbalance. However, with an orbiter\nengine failure, only the configuration with the SRM\'s relocated to pass\ntheir thrust through the eg at lift-off was flyable during lift-off.\nThe inflight analysis contained in Reference 44 included two parts: 1) control law development including an active sideslip feedback roll control\nsystem; and 2) inflight studies where the vehicle\'s response to wind\ndistrubances, SRM engine misalignments, thrust unbalance and engine failure\nwere investigated.\nThe control law development covered the following items:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reviewing the available control moment authority in the maximum\ndynamic pressure regime.\n\xc2\xbb Selecting an engine deflection logic to maximize control authority\nwithout excessive roll-yaw coupling.\ne Modifying the basic SSFS control law to incorporate the use of\nrudder yaw control and rudder/aileron roll control.\n\xc2\xab Calculating attitude control gains\n\xc2\xbb Initial design of a roll command sideslip feedback control scheme.\n\n145\n\n3.1 Continued\nThe inflight analysis produced several broad conclusions:\no "Simple" pitch plane load relief is inadequate for use with the\nsideslip control scheme - the control scheme itself minimizes qa\nand qB but positive attitude control is required to prevent\nexcessive trajectory dispersions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The "back to the wind" sideslip control scheme was promising but\nit needed further development.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The vehicle was satisfactorily controlled when flow in jimsphere\nwinds. However, the more severe 95% synthetic design wind profiles\nsometimes produced unsatisfactory results.\ne The vehicle was not successfully flown with an engine out because\ndynamic pressure became excessive. .An engine out guidance modification would be required.\n.\n. .\n\n146\n\n3.2 SRM/049 PARALLEL BURN CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS\n\nIn May, 1972, the SRM-049 configuration data was loaded into the SSFS\nprogram as reported in Reference 45. This vehicle was extensively analyzed\nboth in lift-off phases of flight and in full boost to oribt dynamics and\ncontrol studies as reported in References 45 through 51. In addition to\nthe standard configuration with fixed SRM\'s, studies were initiated in\nJuly to investigate the use of vectorable SRM trim control.\n3.2.1\n\nLift-Off Analysis - Nonvectorable SRM\'s\n\nResults of investigations of the control capability and lift-off dynamic\ncharacteristics of the 049 launch configuration without vectorable SRM\ntrim control have been documented in Reference 46. Lift-offs were flown\nin the presence of ground winds using various combinations of SRM angular\nmisalignments and SRM thrust unbalances. Typical SRM thrust misalignments and the definition of the RMS roll yaw misalignment combination\nmethod is shown in Figure 3-1.\nResults indicated that the most demanding control problems occurred with\nSRM misalignments that produced vehicle perturbations of -roll and -yaw\nwith a right crosswind. Plots of roll error, pitch error, and yaw error\nfor the right crosswind case with 0.5 degree RMS SRM misalignments in\n-roll and -yaw are shown in Figure 3-2.\nInitially it was believed that with a right crosswind the most severe\ncombination of roll yaw misalignments would be one with polarities of\n-roll/*yaw, which wo\'uld be "in phase" with the wind disturbances.\nHowever, as demonstrated in Reference 46, the -roll/-yaw combination\nproduces the more uncontrollable configuration. The reason for this is\nthe "orientation" of the available TVC roll/yaw control torques. The\n-roll/-yaw combination places the control system nearer or outside the\nlimits of control authority than does the -roll/+yaw combination. Likewise,\ndue to symmetry, the +roll/-yaw combination is similar to the -roll/+yaw\nand the +roll/+yaw produces perturbations equivalent to the -roll/-yaw\nmisalignment combination.\n\n147\n\n2\n\\\n\n*\n- I\n\nvV\n\n5 &\nf1\n> 11\nJ * \xc2\xab)\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\n>!!?!\n!*!\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^^\xc2\xab\n\nV\n\n\\\n\n5\n\n^H\n> ^I 6\n"^ ile!\ny !!);h?\n- ^J\n?\n*\n<f\\\n^\n$\n\ni \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2<\\\nr\n\n<\n\n^\nIf\n\nV\n2\n\nu\n\no\n\nf\n\nID\n>\n\n0\n\n111\n0\n\nA\n\n.fi\nV\n\nJX\n\n2\n\n^\n\n4\ni/)\n5-\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\ni\n\n1\n\n11\n\n0\n\nvJ-\n\n^\n\n1-\n\nSi\no\n\nf\nh\n\nI\n\nHv\n2\nJ\n\n\xc2\xab!i\n1T\n\nuKA p.\n> \xc2\xab? ?\n\nIt\n0\n\n^,^4-\n\nuSui\xc2\xb0\n\n\\\xc2\xa9\n\n0\n\n,ii n ^\n1\n1\'\n\n+\n\n-"-r \' )\nV\nX\n- -^\n\n1) 0\n\n0\ni\n0\n\n1\n\xc2\xa3\n\nS\nI\n\nc:\n\nC1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-j\nj\n\n5P\n\n$\n\no\np\n\n\\\n\nl4\n\ne o\n\nrf*\n\n^\\ \xc2\xbb\n\\y ^ P &\n1\n\n!\n1\n\n2\n\n!\nr\n8\n>1 !\n\xc2\xa7\n\n-1\n\nfI _J_*h$?\nV^y- u ^\ntf\no\n\\\n\n4\n\n14\no\n\n^\n\n^Jl\n\nk\xe2\x80\xa2^\n//\n\xc2\xab5i \xc2\xa3\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n,/)\n\n5\n\no\n\nq\n\n*\n\n\\y \xe2\x80\xa2 *\n\n(^)\n\n/}\n\n2\n\n0\nU^\n^ Cn 2\n? \\ 80\n\n(R)\n\nw \xc2\xa39 p\n> ^5$\nif\n\n0 s~_\n^\\\n( V \xe2\x80\xa2" a. &28<\ni\ni\nS y j\n\nCO\n\nUJ\nQC\n\nj\n\ny\n\nV.\xe2\x80\xa2^\n\ntf\n\nCD\n\n^^ y\n^ tt\n\n9\nB\nJ CL\n\n148\n\n1\n\no\n*x\n\n!/\'/\n\n111\nPVTGH\n\nERROK-\n\nn\nROLL.

Roll and yaw attitude\nerrors for the +ro11/-yaw and -roll/+yaw combinations of misalignments\nfor all winds were found to be of the damped oscillatory form. Maximum\nengine deflections were on the order of 2 degrees, with maximum attitude\nerrors of approximately rdegree for these misalignments.\nFor those simulations performed with -roll/-yaw combinations of 0.25\xc2\xb0\nRMS SRM misalignments, it was observed that the engines would momentarily\nhit their limits in pitch, but as control was regained, engine deflec- v\ntions were reduced. An example of these types of misalignments, attitude\nerrors for the crosswind simulation with -roll/-yaw combinations of 0.25\xc2\xb0\nRMS SRM misalignments are shown in Figure 3-3. As illustrated in this\nplot after approximately 6 seconds, control is regained and engine deflections and attitude errors begin to decrease.\nDrift distances at tower clearnace for the simulations performed were\nfound to be of acceptable magnitude, i.e., on the o^der of 2 to 3 feet.\nExceptions to this were those flights with thrust unbalance; these cases\nproduced crossrange drift distances approximately twice that of similar\nsimulations without thrust unbalance. However, these were still felt to\nbe within acceptable limits.\n3.2.2\n\nInflight Response - Nonvectorable SRM\'s\n\nInflight response of the SRM/049 configuration to SRM misalignments,\nwinds, and control system modifications has been documented in References 47\nand 48. The SRM-049 vehicle simulation was "flown" from lift-off to\norbital insertion using a wind matrix composed of winds shearing to gusts\nat 10K, 20K, and 40K feet. Eastern test range 95 percentile winds were\nused as tailwinds and crosswinds; they reach a maximum velocity of 75\nmeters per second. However, the maximum 95 percentile headwind velocity\n\n151\n\n3.2.2\n\nContinued\n\nfor the eastern test range is only 28 meters per second. Hence, the 42meter per second Vandenberg Air Force Base wind was used for headwinds.\nIn addition to the six wind velocity profiles investigated, consideration\nwas given to inflight changes of wind direction or azimuth. Wind azimuth\nchange profiles were prepared as directed by MSC/G&C Division. The wind\nmatrix thus consisted of: fixed azimuth head, tail and crosswinds; winds\nthat started as head, tail and crosswinds and then sheared away from these\nazimuths as the gust was approached; and winds that started an appropriate\ndistance away from the nominal azimuth (both clockwise and counterclockwise) and then sheared to the nominal direction at the gust. In all cases\nthe wind azimuth remained constant both below and above the 2KM change\nregion. Wind velocity and azimuth change profiles used are tabulated in\nTables 3-1 through 3-7.\nDrift minimum control using accelerometer feedback as described in\nReference 21 was employed in both pitch and yaw. The control gains/were\nvaried continuously to maintain a natural frequency of one radian per\nsecond and a damping ratio of one-half. This provided a resonant frequency of about 0.14 Hz which should be low enough to minimi-ze control\ninteraction with structural bending and propellent slosh. No load relief,\nmethods were used in pitch or yaw in these studies.\nFour roll control techniques were investigated. The first was a simple\nattitude and attitude rate damping system. The second system added proportional and integral sideslip feedback to the roll attitude channel in\norder to roll the vehicle tail into the wind and decrease sideslip.

Notice that the rudder is used\nfor roll control; it uses the same gains as for thrust vector control.\nThe engines and the rudder were limited to \xc2\xb110 degrees deflection.\nWith simple attitude control of roll (no sideslip feedback) all cases\nflew to orbit. The injected weight varied from 351,000 pounds for a\nheadwind to 354,000 pounds for a tailwind (no wind is 352,500 pounds).\nMaximum dynamic pressure (q) and positive qa were observed for a constant\nazimuth 40,000 ft headwind where q reached 569 Ibs/ft and qa reached 3848\n2\ndegree-lbs/ft . The time history of these variables is shown in\nFigures 3-5 and 3-6. (The machine plot miss the 3838 momentary peak.)\nThe highest negative qa was -2964 (Figure 3-7) for the 28,000 foot constant\nazimuth tailwind. The engines just reach the 10\xc2\xb0 stops as shown in\nFigure 3-8. (The scalloped deflection curves reflect the linear interpolation of the pitch command table.) Since the maximum headwind deflection is only 8.5\xc2\xb0, the engine bias could be shifted about 1\xc2\xb0 to -16\xc2\xb0.\n\n160\n\nYAM/\nCOMD.\n\nJ\n\n/TVC\n\n\' ROLL\nCOMD.\n\n\\\n\nK\nl^t\n\n1\n\nh\n\n(^>-\n\n-T-\n\n,\n\n/\n\nFIGURE 3-4\nCONTROL SYSTEM SHOWING SEVERAL SIDESLIP ROLL\nCOMMAND SCHEMES\n161\n\n600\n\n500\n\n100\n\n00\nQ-\n\n. 300\n\nDi\nQ_\n\nO\n\n200\n\n100\n\n30\n\n120\n\n(0\n,\n\nTIME-(SECONDS)\nFIGURE 3-5\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK 40K\nHEADWIND - DYNAMIC PRESSURE\n\n162\n\nISO\n\n3500 \xe2\x80\x94\n\n3000\n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n:\n\ncr\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\nTIME - SECONDS\nFIGURE 3-6\n\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK\n40K HEADWIND - Q-ALPHA\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\n- .\n\n163\n\n-500\n\n-1000\n\nt>\nIJ\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-1500\n\n*&\n\nfc\neC\nb\'.\n<\n\n-2000\n\n-2500\n\n-3000\n\n30\n\nTIME - SECONDS\nFIGURE 3-7\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK 28K TAILWIND - Q-ALPHA\n\n164\n\nTIME - SECONDS\nFIGURE 3-8\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - .NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK 28K TAILWIND - ORBITER PITCH ENGINE DEaECTION\n\n165\n\noo\nQ_\n1500\n\nLU\nCQ\n\n750\n\nTIME - SECONDS\nFIGURE 3-9\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK\n10K CROSSWIND - Q-BETA\n\n166\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 no\n\nTIME - SECONDS\nFIGURE 3-10\nINFLIGHT RESULTS - NO SIDESLIP FEEDBACK\n10K CROSSWIND - ROLL ERROR\n\n1.67\n\n3.2.2\n\nContinued\n\nMaximum qe went as high as 4806 for the 28,000 ft crosswind that swings\naround to approach a tailwind. Roll control authority even with rudder\nadded is inadequate to hold qe above about 3000 degree-lb/ft 2. Roll\n.control was lost during the high q region for all crosswind cases and\nthe lower altitude azimuth shear tailwinds which approach crosswinds\nafter the shear. Figures 3-9 and 3-10 are qe and roll error histories\nfor the 10,000 foot shear crosswind.\nProportional plus integral sideslip feedback (control scheme 2) was\nadded, as shown in Figure 3-4, to roll the vehicle to a tail into the\nwind orientation. (The input to the integrator is opened to prevent\ncontrol saturation if the engine deflection command exceeds eight degrees.)\nThis modification decreased the 28,000 ft qe crosswind from 4806 to 910.\nThe maximum qe for this scheme was 2980 for a 40,000 foot crosswind.\nRoll attitude errors remained as high as 54 degrees for control scheme 2\nbecause of slow vehicle response. The natural frequency was then increased to 1.0 radian per second (control scheme 3). The resultiwas to\nincrease the roll attitude error (up to 83 degrees) because the scaled\nerror signal reached the eight-degree limit and this combined with the\nincreased rate gain limited the roll rate command capability to an even\nsmaller value than previously.\nThe proportional part of the sideslip signal was then transferred to the\nrate .channel as shown in Figure 3-4 (scheme 4). This eliminated the\nsluggish response and reduced roll attitude errors to less than 10\ndegrees.\nTable 3-8 summarizes the results of these studies. This table lists all\n2\ncases in which qa exceeded \xc2\xb13,000 degree-lbs/ft . All cases were below\n4,000 and all were headwinds except for the 28K ft. crosswind without\nsideslip feedback. This case lost roll control in the high q region\n\n168\n\n3.2.2\n\nContinued\n\n"\n\nbecause of the high sideforce and turned belly to the wind similar to\nthe 10,000 ft case shown in Figures 3-9 and 3-10.\nTable 3-8b lists all cases .in which qp exceeds \xc2\xb13,000 degree-lbs/ft2. The\nprincipal cases were the crosswinds without sideslip feedback. With\nsideslip feedback none of the cases exceeded 3000 except for the 28K\nshear from a headwind case with the rate command scheme. For this wind\nprofile there is no sideslip until the wind azimuth started to chage at\nabout 22,000 feet. For this case the vehicle rolled through a high side- .\nslip angle region. The similar lower altitude cases had a lower dynamic\npressure so qe stayed lower, whereas at higher altitudes the wind velocity\nstarted to decrease soon enough to prevent 3 from reaching a large value\nso qe remained below 3000. e also stayed lower for the cases without the\nrate command signal, although it is not clear why the slower response\nshould have produced this result.\nTable 3-8c contains those cases where the wei_ght at orbit insertion\nfered from nominal, by more than 1,000 pounds. Of the- twelve cases listed\nfour had weight gains resulting from tailwinds adding energy. Seven of\nthe eight weight loss cases where headwinds and the most, severe weight. .\nlosses were headwind cases using sideslip feedback. Without sideslip\nfeedback the headwind losses were less than 1500 pounds. .\nTable 3-8d lists the cases which had roll errors exceeding ten degrees.\nLarge errors were experienced generally, until the proportional part of\nthe sideslip signal was applied as a rate command. This control scheme\nimproved vehicle response time sufficiently to keep the error less than\nten degrees.\nSRM perturbations considered were thrust misalignments and thrust unbalance.\nLift-off studies had shown negligible problems with pitch misalignments\nof 0.25 degree so the inflight analysis was performed with combined\n\n169\n\n3.2.2\n\nContinued\n\ni\n\nroll-yaw misalignments of 0.1768 degree in each direction.\ni\n\n(0.1768 x\n\n2=\n\n0.25). The thrust unbalance consisted of 2.5 percent increased thrust for\none SRM and 2.5 percent decreased thrust for the other one.\nThe results are summarized in Table 3-9. None of the cases reached 4,000\n2\ndegree-lbs/ft for qa or qg and most of those exceeding 3,000 were headwinds with sideslip feedback. The only crosswind cases with q exceeding\n3,000 were those in which the misalignments and thrust unbalance tend to\nforce the vehicle to roll and yaw away from the wind. These cases are\nmarginal and misalignments much greater than 0.25 degree would result in\nloss of control.\nMany cases showed weight losses exceeding 1,000 pounds. Only headwind\ncases exceeded 4,000 pounds weight loss and check cases of headwinds\nwithout sideslip feedback revealed no significant weight differences\nwith and without roll-yaw misalignments.\nA gain of 4 was originally selected for the feedback signal. Parameterization of these gains is shown in Figure 3-11. From this graph it is\nseen that these values were well chosen.\nIn summary, these studies demonstrated that, if SRM misalignments can\nbe held to 0.25 degree or less and sideslip feedback is used when winds\nin the high q region are known to be more than 45 degrees away from\nheadwinds, it appears that:\n2\nqa can be held below 4,000 degree-lbs/ft\n2\nqg can be held below 3,500 degree-lbs/ft\nweight to orbit can be held within 2500 Ibs of nominal (for\nnominal thrust history).\n\n170\n\nTABLE 3-8 -

Since the SRM\'s would be used only as trim\ncontrol and would be of low frequency, it was assumed that the control\ngains associated With the orbiter TVC system would still be applicable.\nLift-off boost dynamics and control studies on the 049 SSV utilizing\nseveral forms of SRM control logic, in addition to normal -orbiter TVC,\nwere performed as discussed in References 4.9 and 50. Five basic forms\nof control logic were investigated.\nInitial efforts to include SRM trim TVC capability into.the Space Shuttle\nFunctional Simulator (SSFS) employed use of integral attitude error feedback. For each control axis the attitude error from the normal orbiter\nTVC system was scaled and integrated to provide trim control to the SRM\'s.\nFlight simulations were performed initially with no limits on the SRM\nintegrators, but with one degree hardware limits on the SRM actuators.\nFlights were performed with 1 degree SRM misalignments in roll, with values\nof .02, .04 and .06 for the SRM integrator constant, and with values of .1,\n.3 and .5 for SRM actuator rate limits. Results indicated that loss of\ncontrol occurred for the system due to "overcharging" of the SRM integrators. Since the actuators were limited to 1 degree and the SRM integrators were unlimited, this introduced excessive lag into the control\nsystem. Limits were then applied to the integrators. However, large roll\nerrors still persisted.\n.\n..\n.\nNumerous intermediate control systems were investigated; however, final\nconclusions from the analysis (Reference 49) indicated that a control\nsystem using integral attitude error plus rate damping for roll and yaw and\nonly integral attitude error in the pitch axis produced acceptable results.\n\n176\n\n3.2.3\n\nContinued\n\nFigures 3-12 and 3-13 summarize the data obtained for those runs made with\nthis system. Peak roll and yaw errors are seen to decrease as actuator\nrate limit is increased. In order to minimize power requirements to drive\nthe SRM\'s, it was desired to keep actuator rate limits as low as possible\nand still hold peak roll to a reasonable value. From these plots a compromise rate limit value of 0.3\xc2\xb0/sec was chosen for a baseline system.\nThis value along with an integrator constant of 0.02 were felt at this\npoint to represent a satisfactory system. (An integrator constant of 0.04,\nalthough producing smaller roll errors, was found to lead to more "ringing"\nin the control system.)\nAs directed by MSC/G&C Division, this system was modified slightly such\nthat all control axes were composed of the integral of attitude error and\nrate damping for vectorable SRM trim control. This control system is\nillustrated in Figure 3-14. This addition to the control system presented\na more unified approach to SRM trim control. Comparison of the results\nof this system with those of the previous one without rate damping in\npitch indicate insignificant differences.\nFigures 3-15 through 3-18 present the results of simulated lift-offs of\nthe 049 SSV configuration flown with 0.5\xc2\xb0 RNS -roll/-yaw combination SRM\nmisalignments and \xc2\xb12.5% SRM thrust unbalance. Shown in these plots are\nattitude errors, pitch and yaw orbiter engine traces, and SRM pitch gimbal\ntraces. The same parameters are shown in Figures 3-19 through 3-22 for\n1.0\xc2\xb0 RMS -roll/-yaw combination SRM misalignments and \xc2\xb12.5% thrust unbalance.\n.\n3.2.4\n\nInflight Performance for Vectorable SRM System\n\nInflight results were presented in Reference 51 verifying the capability\nof the vectorable SRM trim control system under severe wind conditions.\nSimulations were performed in the presence of 28,000 ft. crosswinds and\n\n177\n\n-40\n\nI\nJ\nJ\n0\ntf\n\naJ\n\nDL\n\nFIGURE\n\n3-12\n\n1PEAK ROLL ERROR DURING"LIFT OFF AS A FUNCTION OF RATE LIMIT ;\n\n178\n\n1\n\n\'\n\n~!\n\nj-. \'"_? r . \'\n\n,~\n\nI\n\nj\n\n^J ..:-;\n\n,*>\n\n!">\xe2\x80\xa2 !"-\n\nI.- j\n\ni ; ;"/ ! ..-Vy1\n\n- A-\n\n.5\n\nRATE.\n\xe2\x80\xa2__.___\n\n__._FIGURE__3 r .13 . _ ^\n\nPEAK YAW ERRORAS A\n\nUNCTION O F t A T E\n\n;\n\nH"\'\n\n.179\n\n\'-T\n\nJ\n\nCT,\n\n\xe2\x80\x94VTVC\n/ ROLL\nCOUD.\n\n,U\n:l\n\nRODROLL\nGOMD.\n\n1\n\nT/Y\n/A\n\n+\n\ne\n\nJ\n\nN\nU.IVlA\n\nK\n^1\n\n\'+.T\n1-4-^-\n\n~S>\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x84\xa2 - -\n\n"\n\n" -\n\n-*-0\n\nTC^\n\nCLO 0 ^ 2\n- * 0\n\nFIGURE 3-14.\nCONTROL SYSTEM WITH VECTORABLE SRM CONTROL\n\nGIMB.SRM,.5DEG RMSC-ROLL-YAW),INT=.02,SRM RLIM=\n\n.3\n\n1.9\n\nco\nLU\nUJ\n\n** \xc2\xab\xc2\xabW *****< >\xc2\xabM* ****\n\nor\n\n0\n\nc/o\n\nC\xc2\xa3\n\nO\n\no;\ncc.\n\nLU\n\nControl System V\n0.5\xc2\xb0 RMS Roll-Yaw SRM Misalignment\n+2.5% Thrust Unbalance\n\nLU\n\nQ\n\n20\n\nIf\n\nTHE BOEING COMPANY\n\nIf\n\nTIME -\n\n30\n\n)\nf\n\nSECONDS\n\nFIGURE 3-15\nLIFTOFF RESULTS - VECTORABLE SRM .- 0.5\xc2\xb0 SRM\nMISALIGNMENT . - ATTITUDE ERRORS\n\n181\n\nGIMB.SRM..5DEG RMS(-ROLL-YAW),INT=.02.SRM RLIM= .3\n\nu U\xe2\x80\x94/Engine 2\n\nControl System V\n0.5\xc2\xb0 RMS Roll-Yaw SRM Misalignment\n+2.5.% Thrust Unbalance\n\nEngine 3\n\nII\n\nI I\nTIME? -SECONDS\n\nTHE BOEING COMPANY\n\nFIGURE 3-16\nLIFTOFF RESULTS - VECTORABLH SftM - -5\xc2\xb0 SRM\nMISALIGNMENT - OR8ITER PITCH ENGINE DEFLECTIONS\n\n182\n\n.

This modification is shown in Figure 3-23. Flights were simulated without sideslip feedback and with sideslip feedback gains (Kj.)\nof 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 with a beta signal limit (BUM) of 5\xc2\xb0.\nTable 3-10 summarizes the crosswind results and Table 3-11 summarizes\nthe headwind results. Several variables are shown, but the most interesting was q3. It is seen that, for the crosswind, q3 decreases as the feedback gain increases, while the opposite is true for the headwind. Based\non these results, a feedback gain of 0.8 was selected as a baseline for\nfuture analysis.\nw\n\nFigures 3-24 through 3-41 show results of SRM gimbaling for the 28,000 ft\ncrosswind simulations with 1 degree RMS misalignments. Figures 3-24\nthrough 3-32 are without sideslip feedback,, and Figures 3-33 through 3-41\nare with sideslip feedback. They illustrate the smooth response using\nSRM gimbaling and the small demand on the orbiter main enginegimbaling\nin the high q region. Comparison with Reference 48 showed that, for the\nheadwind case with sideslip feedback, qg was reduced from 3566 PSF\xc2\xb0 to\n2557 PSF\xc2\xb0 when SRM gimbaling is added. For the crosswind case qe was\nreduced from 3194 PSF\xc2\xb0 to 2130 PSF\xc2\xb0.\n\n209\n\n3.3 BASELINE CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe baseline launch configuration control system software described in this\nsection satisfies the requirement to control the SRM parallel burn vehicle\nfrom lift-off through SRM engine cutoff and orbital insertion. This control system has evolved from the investigations of References 44, 48, 49,\nand 51. It is the result of efforts to provide active roll control for\nload alleviation and the option to vector SRM thrust such as to trim out\nSRM angular misaligments. Specific details presented in this section are\nfor a nominal rigid body version of the MSC SRM-049 launch configuration.\nCompensation for bending and malfunctions can easily be incorporated.\nThe system is adaptable to various control laws, including attitude control (as in Saturn V), drift minimum control (with and without acceleraometer\nfeedback), and/or load relief control. It also contains the option of\nusing thrust vector control (TVC) on the SRM\'s as trim control to remove\nInitial thrust.misalignments. In-addition, sideslip feedback may be employed during boost phases of flight to roll the vehicle into a tail to the\nwind attitude as a means of load alleviation.\nThe following paragraphs contain a description of the control systems\nwith functional block diagrams of the pitch, yaw, and roll channels and\na discussion of the configuration dependent variables.\n3.3.1\n\nSoftware Description\n\nThe baseline launch configuration control system is essentially a conventional booster control system. It is a digital autopilot receiving gimbal\nangles from a stable platform, body rates from body mounted rate gyros, and\nbody Y and Z axes trans!ational accelerations from body mounted accelerometers. It also receives prestored engine deflection and acceleration commands, and attitude commands either prestored or from a guidance system.\nFrom these inputs the control system determines and outputs deflection\ncommands for the orbiter, SRM, and rudder actuators.\n\n210\n\n3.3.1\n\nContinued\n\nThe prestored commands for attitude, acceleration, and orbiter engine\ndeflections are the measured values taken from a reference trajectory.\nThe baseline reference trajectory was shaped for gravity turn (zero\nresultant acceleration normal to the longitudinal stability axis) in\norder that roll maneuvers might be accomplished without deviation from\nthe desired trajectory. Variable control gains are calculated to satisfy\nthe selected control taw and desired rigid body frequency and damping\nratio. For current studies the drift minimum control law was employed\nwith a natural frequency of one radian per second with a 0.7 damping ratio\nin both pitch and yaw. Roll control utilizes both thrust vector and rudder\ncontrol at a natural frequency of 0.5 radian per second and a damping\nratio of 0.5. It should be noted that gain calculations were made assuming\nno SRM thrust vector control. However, since the SRM\'s are used for trim\ncontrol (low frequency), this assumption is valid for the rigid body\nanalysis. Development of gain calculation equations is given in\nReference 19.\nA more detailed functional description of each channel of the control\nsystem is provided in the following paragraphs. Separate block diagrams\nfor roll, pitch, and yaw channels are presented.\n3.3.2\n\nRoll Channel Description\n\nReferring to Figure 3-42, the block in the lower right hand corner labeled\n"Vehicle and Subsystem Dynamics" represents actuator and sensor dynamics,\nprefiltering for the sensors, flight computer input and output registers\nand any A/D or D/A converters. Inputs to the control system from "Vehicle\nand Subsystem Dynamics" are the inertia! platform outer gimbal angle and\nrate measurements from one or more body (or wing) mounted rate gyros.\nOutputs from the control system to the vehicle are orbiter engine, SRM\nengine, and rudder deflection commands.\n\n211\n\no\nto\nUJ\n\nto\nto\n\n\xc2\xab>o\n\nz\no\nU\nI\n\nZ\n\nz\no\n\no\n\nO\n\no\n\n0\xc2\xa3\n\nu_\n\nz\no\nu\n\no\n\nLU\nt\xe2\x80\x94\n\nZ\nII\n\nI\nu\nz\nLU\n\nz\nLU\n\nto\n\na\nu\n\n212\n\n.\n\nCM\n\no:\nZ3\nCD\n\no\no\n\nCO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2a:\nCO\n\n3.3.2\n\nContinued\n\nFollowing the attitude loop in Figure 3-42, the platform gimbal angle (<|>)\nis differenced with the inertial attitude command (<j>C) to produce the\ninertial attitude error (<j>E) which is transformed to a body roll error\n(4>EB) by adding the inner gimbal angle error times the sine of the middle\ngimbal angle (<j>EB = 4>EB + <f>EI simj;). At this point the body roll error\nsignal is differenced with the signal from the sideslip feedback integrator.\nThe purpose of the sideslip feedback portion of the control system is to\nprovide a means of alleviating large sideloads (qB) resulting from cross \xe2\x80\xa2\nwinds, by sensing the sideslip angle and producing appropriate control\nsignals such as to roll the vehicle into a tail to the wind attitude.\nReferring to Figure 3-42, this is achieved by integrating the sideslip\nsignal and subtracting it from the body roll error signal. In addition,\nthe sideslip signal is scaled and^differenced with the roll rate signal.\nIt should be noted that the sideslip signal is passed through a 0.2\xc2\xb0\ndeadband and limited. Following this is a block which represents a\n"ramp-on" and "ramp-off" scheduling. This is to allow the sideslip roll\nto be initiated after tower clearance and be turned off after the wind\neffect has become negligible (after the high dynamic pressure region).\nThe switch prior to the sideslip integrator is activated by the limited\norbiter engine roll commands. When the roll command becomes greater than\n8 degrees, the switch to the integrator is opened. This prevents the\nsideslip integrator from saturating the roll commands and reserves 2\ndegrees of roll control for rate damping commands. The body roll error\nsignal, having been differenced with the sideslip integrator, is at this\npoint split to supply commands to both the aerodynamic control and the\nthrust vector control. Referring to the roll channel block diagram, it\nshould be noted that a limiter has been included in the attitude error\nloop. This limiter reserves some TVC authority for rate damping (even\nthough the attitude error signal may be saturated) thus preventing\noscillation and complete loss of control because of large signal instability.\n\n213\n\n3,3.2\n\nContinued\n\nReturning to the "Vehicle and Subsystem Dynamics" block in Figure 3-42,\nroll rate gyro signals are filtered and blended as required. The roll rate\nerror is then scaled and filtered separately for the engine and aero\nchannels and is mixed with the attitude error signals to produce total\nerror signals. The rudder deflection signal is limited to avoid overdriving the servos and sent to the output registers of the rudder. In\nthe engine TVC loop the combined roll signal ( 6C) is at this point\nsplit to provide signals for orbiter engine control and SRM trim control .\nFor SRM trim control, the combined roll signal is rate limited, integrated,\nand sent to the SRM deflection logic. The limiter associated with the SRM\nintegrator limits the integrator and its output. As noted in Reference 49,\nit was found to be necessary to limit the integrator rather than just its\noutput to prevent it from "overcharging" and inducing excessive lag into\nthe system. The baseline SRM deflection logic is simple, equal and\nopposite SRM pitch actuator commands. Finally, the SRM engine deflection\nsignals are limited to the hardware limits and stored in output registers.\nIn the orbiter engine TVC loop the combined roll signal ( SC) is limited\nto the hardware limits and goes to the orbiter engine deflection logic.\nThe orbiter engine deflection logic is complicated by the need to decouple\nyaw reaction from the roll command. Roll commands are sent to the appropriate orbiter engines actuators to produce the desired vehicle torque,\ni.e., equal and opposite pitch actuator deflections to the lower two\norbiter engines and a yaw actuator command to the upper engine. In order\nto remove the yaw induced by the upper orbiter engine, the lower engines\nare commanded in yaw in a direction opposite to the upper engine and by\nan amount equal to one half of the yaw deflection of the upper .engine.\nThis deflection logic is illustrated in.Figure 3-43.\n..\n\n214\n\nFIGURE 3-43\nORBITER ROLL CONTROL DEFLECTION LOGIC\n\n215\n\n3.3.3\n\nYaw Channel Description\n\nThe yaw channel block diagram in Figure 3-44 is laid out in the same\nmanner as the roll channel with the "Vehicle and Subsystem Dynamics"\nblock in the lower right hand corner, the "Inertia! Attitude Command"\nin the upper left hand corner and the "Engine Deflection Logic" on the\nright. The aerodynamic control circuit is missing because there is\nadequate engine control authority to handle yaw plane torques.\nThree features which were not included in the roll channel appear in the\nyaw channel. An accelerometer input has been added to the attitude\nloop, a forward loop integrator follows the limiter, and a rate command\nsignal is differenced with the input from the rate gyros.\nThe platform gimbal angle (ijj) is differenced with the inertia! attitude\ncommand (i|>C), transformed to body attitude error (ijjEB = ij\xc2\xa3I cos<)> eEI sin<}> cosij;) and scaled. The error signal is then modified by summing\nan acceleration error signal. The acceleration error is obtained by\nblending appropriately filtered signals from one or more body mounted\naccelerometers and then applying gain and filtering compensation according to the control law or bending requirements. For the baseline rigid\nbody design, the gain is varied with time to meet the drift minimum\nrequirements of Reference 19. After provision for additional filtering\n(not used in the rigid body baseline) and after limiting the combined\nerror signal, the forward loop integrator trims out steady state errors\nresulting from biases or off-nominal conditions.\nThe rate command signal is introduced because the normal attitude command\nchanges at a predictable rate. The rate command signal minimizes the\ntendency for the vehicle attitude to lag behind the attitude command due\nto rate feedback. If the vehicle rolls appreciably, the rate command\nmust be applied partially to the yaw channel. In operation, the attitude\ncommand is differentiated, multiplied by the sine of <j>, scaled the same\nas the rate feedback and differenced with the rate feedback signal.

The\nSRM trim in yaw is the same as that previously described for roll. The\ncommand signal is rate limited, integrated and limited, and sent to the\nSRM deflection logic, where both SRM yaw actuators are commanded equally.\n3.3.4\n\nPitch Channel Description\n\nComparison of Figure 3-45, which is the pitch channel block diagram, with\nFigure 3-44 (yaw channel) reveals that the only difference is the addition\nof prestored acceleration commands and prestored engine deflection commands.\nBoth of these command schedules are the nominal values from a reference\ntrajectory.\nThe prestored acceleration command is necessary because of the lack of\nvehicle symmetry, both in an offset center of gravity and in aerodynamic\ncharacteristics. The-results of these asymmetries is that the nominal\nnormal acceleration (Z)"is typically non-zero. The addition of the prestored acceleration command permits use of accelerometer feedback with any\nfeasible trajectory to modify the attitude error signal to conform to the\ndesired control law (drift minimum for the baseline case).\nThe prestored engine deflection command schedule provides coarse control\nof the engine gimbal trim in the pitch plane. Center of gravity travel\nalone could be handled by the integrator. Aerodynamic pitching moment\nincreases sharply in the vicinity of Mach one and decreases again thereafter. A high integrator gain would be required to follow these rapidly\nchanging deflection requirements. Since a high integrator gain is undesirable in the high dynamic pressure region, the prestored commands\nare used to control the nominal part of this variation. For the baseline case the integrator gain (T) is zero.\n\n218\n\nZ\nO\n\nu.\nO\n\n0\xc2\xa3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2g\ncc:\n\no\nUJ\n\nfc\n_l\nI\xe2\x80\x94\n\nz\no UJ\nz\nz z\no a:\n\n^\n\n1\n\nU\n\nO\nu.\nZ\nO\nu\n\no:\n\nII\n\nZd\nOZ\n\n1 PRE\'STORED\nENGINE\nDEFLECT\n[ COMM/\n\no\n\nO\n\nI\xe2\x80\x94\n\nto\n\n8\n\nh\n\nLO\n\nUJ\n\nI\n00\n\n<\nCO\n\nUJ\n\na:\n\no\n\nto\n\n\xc2\xabC\nCO\n\nCO\n\n.M\n\no\n\nO\n\nz\n\no\na.\n\nUJ\n\nQ\n\nz\nU\nuo\nII\nUL\n\n219\n\n3.3.4\n\nContinued\n\nFor the orbiter engine deflection logic the pitch channel is the same as\nthe yaw channel with the exception that all orbiter engines are deflected\nequally in pitch. For the SRM trim deflection logic the basic principles\nare the same as presented before for the roll and yaw channels. However,\nthe pitch SRM deflection logic is slightly different. Since ample pitch\ncontrol is available from the orbiter TVC system but limited orbiter TVC\nroll control is present, the SRM deflection logic has been devised such\nthat roll control takes precedence over pitch commands. If the combined\nroll and pitch commands to either SRM produce a command signal rate\ngreater than the limit, then the rate to the pitch integrator is the rate\'\nlimit minus the roll rate command. Also, if the combined roll and pitch\nengine deflection command from the SRM integrators is greater than the\nlimit, then the pitch deflection command is set equal to the limit minus\nthe roll command. Thus full roll commands are preserved, and, if a\nreduction is necessary, it is taken from the pitch channel.\n3.3.5\n\nConfiguration Dependency\n\nThe basic control system is designed for a dual SRM parallel burn configuration. The control gain and command schedules are, of course,\nconfiguration dependent. They will be affected by modifications to\neither the vehicle configuration or the reference trajectory. This will\nnot impact the design, however, because all control gains and commands\nare continuously variable input functions of time. Some of them may\nsubsequently be modified to functions of other trajectory variables,\nsuch as altitude and velocity, but this will involve only minor software\nmodifications.\nFilters have not been developed. They will be functions of the vibration and slosh characteristics of the launch configuration. The provision\nfor incorporating filters at various points is intended to reduce the\norder of each filter.\n\n220\n\n4.0\n\nTASK III FLEXIBLE BODY STABILITY AND CONTROL ANALYSIS\n\nFrequent changes in vehicle configuration prevented performance of\nflexible body analysis. However mathematical models were developed\nfor use in the SSFS. These models were programmed for a parallel burn\nsolid rocket motor configuration such as the 049 configuration analyzed\nin Section 3. The flexible body version of SSFS is currently being\nchecked out. The models as contained in Reference 52 are presented\nin"the following paragraphs.\n4.1\n\nFLEXIBLE BODY PROGRAM DESCRIPTION\n\nThis program contains the bending and slosh models for the launch\nconfiguration during first stage boost. It uses a generalized modal\napproach to bending which represents the elastic response by standard normal modal equations with viscous damping. Included are models.\nfor aerodynamic forces and moment^ and thrust forces and moments to\naccount for bending effects as well as the tail wags dog contribution to bending. The rigid body and elastic response equations\nprovided here are uncoupled and are considered separately since the\nmagnitude of the coupling is insignificant. The number of equations\nis very sensitive to the vehicle configuration and to the completeness of the bending analysis. Therefore, when data becomes available\nit is likely that only a small percentage of the general set provided\nhere will actually be required for SSV analysis.\nThe model sums all the forces acting on each of the equivalent mass\npoints and for a given mode numerically integrates the sum with a\nsecond order linear differential equation in modal displacement.\nThe number of mass points at which aero forces and modal displacements\nare calculated will be less than 50. The number of modes at these\npoints will be less than 10 each. The number of slosh masses will\nbe less than 5 and the number of modes per slosh mass will be less\nthan 5. The EOM, guidance atmosphere and control subroutine must be\npresent to provide inputs for this model.\n221\n\n4.2\n\nVibration Equations\n\nNl\nZ\n\n(F\nv\n=\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 d> . .)\n\'\'\'\n\nMl\nZ\n\n+\n\n. <j> \'. . + F . <j> . . + F\naxj 9 xij\nayj ^yij\nazj\n\n. . + F. . 9\nd> \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 + F. . d> . .\n\n(F.\n\n.4\n\n(F\nv\n\n.6..\n\n^\n\nKl\nZ\n=\n\nsxj \'PXIJ\n\n+ rF\n\n.\n\nsyj\n\nN2\nZ\n\n+\n\n( M . <9b \' . . + M\n*\'.\n+M . < t \' . .\nxij\n"ayj \xc2\xbbyij\n"azj 9\n\nM2\nZ\n=\n\n+\n\n. d)1 . . + M. . *\' . . + M. . *\'v y .)\n.\nt x j v xij\ntyj 9yU\ntzj\n\n(M.\nv\n\n,\n\nK2\nZ\n\n1\n\nv(M\n\n,\n\n.9A . . + M\n\nsxj xij\n\n(qi + 2 ?1\n\nWi\n\nsyj *yij\n\nq^. + w q.)\n\ndt\nq. = / q. dt +\n\n,\n\n. ,, . + M\nd>,,.\n\nqi\n\n222\n\nszj\n\n9 .\n. 4 ; .)\n\n4.2 Vibration Equations (Continued)\nWhere:\nNl\n\n= number of aero stations for aero forces\n\nN2\n\n= number of aero stations for aero moments\n\nMl\n\n= number of engines producing forces\n\nM2\n\n= number "Of engines producing moments\n\nKl\n\n= number of slosh stations for slosh forces\n\nK2\n\n= number of slosh stations for slosh moments\n\nq.\n\n= modal displacement due to bending mode i\n\ne\xc2\xab\n\n= damping coefficient for mode i\n\nu).\n\n= frequency of mode i\n\nm.\n\n= normalized mass for mode i\n\nF, . = aero forces in X direction at station j\naXJ\nF\n\n. = aero forces in Y direction at station j\n\nFazj = aero forces in Z direction at station J\na .\nF\ntxi = tnrust forces inx direction for engine j\nF. . = thrust forces in Y direction for engine j\nF. . = thrust forces in Z direction for engine j\nF5XJ. = slosh forces in X direction at station j\nc\nF\n\n. = slosh forces in Y direction at station j\n\nFszj = slosh forces in Z direction at station j\n.\nM* . = aero moments about X axis at station j\naXJ\nM Ojr J = aero moments about y axis at station j\n.\nMazj = aero moments about z axis at station j\n3 .\n\n223\n\n4.2 Vibration Equations (Continued)\n\ntxd = thrust moments about X axis due to engine j\n\nM\n\n%j\n\n= thrust moments about Y axis due to engine j\n\nt;j = thrust moments about Z axis due to engine j\n\nH\n\nsxj = slosh moments about X axis at station j\n\nM\n\nM\n\n= slosh moments about Y axis at station j\n\nsyo\n\nszj = slosh moments about Z axis at station j\n\nM\n\n= mode shape translation in X direction for mode i at location j\n= mode shape translation in Y direction for mode i at location j\n\n*\n\n= mode shape translation in Z direction for mode i at location j\n\n*:\n\n= mode slope about X axis for mode i at location j\n-\xe2\x80\xa2mode slope about Y axis for mode i at location j\n= mode slope about Z axis for mode i at location j\n\n4.3 Aerodynamic Forces\n\nwxpj\nwypj\n\nEa]\n\n[5]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV\naybj\n\ns\n\n-\n\nwzpj\n\n-1\n[]\n6\n\nV\n\np\n\nR,\n\ny\n\nV\nv\nazbj\n\nY\n\n224\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'V f\\ \'\n\n.\n\nV\n\np\n\nwxpj\nwypj\n\nv wzpj\n\np\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV\n\nm\n\nm\n\n.\n\n4.3 Aerodynamic Forces\n\nV\n\n(Continued)\n\naxbj \' .\' ty - Z cg> - R <VJ- V\n\nV\n\n= R (X\n\nj- V\n\n\'\n\nP\n\n<ZJ - V\n\n"azbj \xe2\x80\x9e\nV\n\nafcbj\n\nH3\n=\n\n\'..\n\n\xc2\xbbx1J\n\nM3\n\n*y1J\nM3\nVazbj = E\n"\'\n1=\n\nM3\n\nIv\n\nV\n\naxbj\n\nsV\n\naybJ\n\n\' M3\n\nIV\nV\n\naybj\n\nV\n\n= V\n\nazbj\n\n.z=2\n\n.,\nM3\nV\nJL zij \' \' azbj . =\n\' \'\n*\n\n,\n\nM3\nq\n\nV\n\n*xij i \' axbj\n\nM3\nIV V\n*\nazbj .- axbj .__ l *\ny1j\n\n225\n\n.E=\nM3\n\nV\n\ni " aybJ\n\ni=\n\n4.3 Aerodynamic Forces\n\n(Continued)\n\n"axbj \' "axbj \xe2\x80\xa2> "axbj * "axbj + "axb\xe2\x84\xa2\nI\n\nV\n\n= V\n\naybj\n\naybj\n\nazbj\n\n+ V\n\naybj\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nV\n\nIII\n\nII\n\n+ V\n\naybj\n\nII\n\n+ V\n\nTu\n\naybj\n\nIII\n\nTl/\n\n-Va2bj+ Va2bj+ vazbj + vazbf\n\nThe previous 6 equations must be solved simultaneously for V .., V ,.,\nand Vfl . ..
