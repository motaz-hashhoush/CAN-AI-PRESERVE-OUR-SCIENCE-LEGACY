The NASA SBIR programs have provided F&S the funds and the technology to develop ruggedized coatings and coating techniques that are applied during the optical fiber draw process. The F&S optical fiber fabrication facility and developed coating methods enable F&S to manufacture specialty optical fiber with custom designed refractive index profiles and protective or active coatings. F&S has demonstrated sputtered coatings using metals and ceramics and combinations of each, and has also developed techniques to apply thin coatings of specialized polyimides formulated at NASA Langley Research Center. With these capabilities, F&S has produced cost-effective, reliable instrumentation and sensors capable of withstanding temperatures up to 800? C and continues building commercial sales with corporate partners and private funding. More recently, F&S has adapted the same sensing platforms to provide the rapid detection and identification of chemical and biological agents", "title": "Optical Fiber Protection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020063431, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020063431, "isbn": "0-16-050159-8", "id": "51422a3cb09f42b19af4a3bd1821c91f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1999", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020063431.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020063431/downloads/20020063431.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020063431/downloads/20020063431.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020063431/downloads/20020063431.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
