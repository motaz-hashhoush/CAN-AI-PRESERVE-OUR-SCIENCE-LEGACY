GMD developed a reliable colorimetric gas monitoring dosimeter for NASA, then modified it to create the commercial GMD 530 Series Hydrazine Badge. The badge has two separate paper tape chemistries which change color when the gases are detected, the density of the color being in proportion to the time of exposure and amount of gas in the air. The badge is used in facilities where hypergolic fuel is produced or used in support of space vehicles, satellites, missiles, and military aircraft auxiliary power units.", "title": "Toxicity Warning Badge", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020079163, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020079163, "id": "decdffdc1fb84976a5009e33a4a09f20", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1996", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020079163.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020079163/downloads/20020079163.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020079163/downloads/20020079163.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020079163/downloads/20020079163.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
