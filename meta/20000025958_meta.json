This radar system produced unrivaled 3-D images of the Earth's Surface. The mission was launched at 12:31 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. This tape presents a pre-launch briefing for the press held on Jan. 28, 2000. Statements were given by Doug Lyons, Shuttle Test Director; Scott Higginbotham, STS-99 Payload Director and Ed Priselac, Shuttle Weather Officer. Doug Lyons reported on the checkout of the equipment. Scott Higgenbotham reviewed the steps required to assemble and test the SRTM instrumentation and equipment. Ed Priselac gave the weather forecast for the expected launch day. The questions concerned a possible problem with a part onboard the shuttle and the likely impact this might have on the launch.", "title": "STS-99 Countdown Status Briefing", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T13:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000025958, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000025958, "id": "e8c6fe4bb27449af891c9fe362590c0c", "publicationDate": "2000-02-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
