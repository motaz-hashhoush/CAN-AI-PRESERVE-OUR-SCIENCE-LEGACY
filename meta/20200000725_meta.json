On the basis of process-detailed, spatially explicit representation of four interlinked planetary boundaries (biosphere integrity, land-system change, freshwater use, nitrogen flows) and agricultural systems in an internally consistent model framework, we here show that almost half of current global food production depends on planetary boundary transgressions. Hotspot regions, mainly in Asia, even face simultaneous transgression of multiple underlying local boundaries. If these boundaries were strictly respected, the present food system could provide a balanced diet (2,355 kcal per capita per day) for 3.4 billion people only. However, as we also demonstrate, transformation towards more sustainable production and consumption patterns could support 10.2 billion people within the planetary boundaries analysed. Key prerequisites are spatially redistributed cropland, improved water\u2013nutrient management, food waste reduction and dietary changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by all nations\nin 2015 is the first ever commitment to a world development\npath that safeguards the stability of the Earth system\nas a prerequisite for meeting universal human standards1. The longstanding\nchallenge of achieving food security through sustainable\nagriculture is particularly acute in this context as world agriculture\nis a leading cause for the current transgressions of multiple planetary\nboundaries (PBs) globally and regionally2\u20135. The PB framework\nis a comprehensive scientific attempt to synoptically define\nour planet\u2019s biogeophysical limits to anthropogenic interference. It\nsuggests bounds to nine interacting processes that together delineate\na Holocene-like Earth system state. The Holocene is chosen as\nthe reference state as it is the only period known to provide a safe\noperating space for a world population of several billion people,\nand according to a precautionary principle, the PBs are set in sufficient\ndistance from processes that may critically undermine Earth\nsystem resilience and global sustainability. A challenging question,\nthus, is whether human development goals such as food security\ncan be met while maintaining multiple PBs along with their subglobal\nmanifestations.\nFurther PB transgressions could jeopardize the chances of providing\nsufficient food for a world population projected to be wealthier\nand reach >9 billion by 2050. This conundrum portrays a tradeoff\nbetween Earth\u2019s biophysical carrying capacity and humankind\u2019s rising\nfood demand, calling in response for radical rethinking of food\nproduction and consumption patterns6\u20139. Yield gap closures, avoidance\nof excessive input use, shifts towards less resource-demanding\ndiets, food waste reductions and efficient international trade are\ncrucial options for sustainably increasing the food supply10\u201315. For\nexample, enhancing water-use efficiency on irrigated and rain-fed\nfarms can triple or quadruple crop yields in low-performing systems,\nsuggesting possible global gains of >20% (ref. 16). Even higher gains\nappear feasible through globally optimized configurations of the\nland-use pattern17, and cutting food losses by half could generate\nfood for another billion people18. Thus, collective large-scale implementation\nof such options could sustain food for a further growing\nworld population19. Yet achieving this within a safe operating space\nas defined by PBs requires not only a halt to but actually a reversal\nof existing PB transgressions. Previous studies suggest that such a\nreconciliation might be possible, but these were based on aggregate\nrepresentations of PBs (not accounting for the spatial patterns\nof limits, transgressions and interactions) or considered only one\nboundary in isolation17,20\u201323.\nHere, we systematically quantify to what extent current food production\ndepends on local to global transgressions of the PBs for biosphere\nintegrity, land-system change, freshwater use and nitrogen\n(N) flows, along with the potential of a range of solutions to avoid\nthese transgressions and still increase food supply (Table 1). To this\nend, we configured an internally consistent process-based model of\nthe terrestrial biosphere including agriculture (LPJmL) with multiple\nspatially distributed PBs and their interactions. LPJmL is among\nthe longest-established and best-evaluated biosphere models, showing\nrobust performance regarding simulation of, for example, carbon,\nwater and crop yield dynamics (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2\nand Supplementary Table 1; see ref. 24 for a comprehensive benchmarking\nand Supplementary Methods for more detail on model\nevaluations). In principle following established definitions4, we\nrefine the computation of some PBs with respect to their regional\npatterns and interactions (Methods), providing globally gridded\nprecautionary limits to human interference with the Earth system at\na level of great detail. In particular, we account for the evidence that\nmany PBs need to be represented spatially explicitly4 to cover their", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000725, "publisher": "Springer Nature", "eissn": "2398-9629", "id": "9c9b2f02705d4709a907c0acb41699c0", "publicationName": "Nature Sustainability", "publicationDate": "2020-01-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
