The  micro-transceiver is being designed for future Mars exploration missions, but can be adapted for other proximity links. It supports transmission rates up to 256 ksps and higher in BPSK  or QPSK format for data return and receives command/control instructions at up to 8 ksps. In addition to its low mass/power features, temperature compensated circuit and system design  and radiation tolerance allow operation outside of large shielded enclosures, further reducing the mass and complexity of exploration vehicles.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060044276, "endDate": "2005-10-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "12th NASA Symposium on VLSI Design", "location": "Coeur d''Alene, ID", "id": "cb833c8d86c5471599043974a607fe19", "startDate": "2005-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060044276, "id": "b4a6355b56ed4d08beb23e615ef001dd", "publicationDate": "2005-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
