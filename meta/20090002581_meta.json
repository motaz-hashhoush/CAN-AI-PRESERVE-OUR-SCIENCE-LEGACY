LETS is a cryo-pumped vacuum chamber facility capable of high vacuum (10-7 Torr). LETS is a cylindrical chamber, 30 in. (0.8 m) diameter by 48 in. (1.2 m) long thermally controlled vacuum system. The chamber is equipped with a full array of radiation sources including vacuum ultraviolet, electron, and proton radiation. The unique feature of LETS is that it contains a large lunar simulant bed (18 in. x 40 in. x 6 in.) holding 75 kg of JSC-1a simulant while operating at a vacuum of 10-7 Torr. This facility allows three applications: 1) to study the charging, levitation and migration of dust particles, 2) to simulate the radiation environment on the lunar surface, and 3) to electrically charge the lunar simulant enhancing the attraction and adhesion of dust particles to test articles more closely simulating the lunar surface dust environment. LETS has numerous diagnostic instruments including TREK electrostatic probes, residual gas analyzer (RGA), temperature controlled quartz crystal microbalance (TQCM), and particle imaging velocimeter (PIV). Finally, LETS uses continuous Labview data acquisition for computer monitoring and system control.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090002581, "endDate": "2008-08-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Lunar Regolith Behavior Workshop", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "10ccd17bccf24601b374b0c30dc766ae", "startDate": "2008-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090002581, "id": "5ae1205d4f1d4961808494fbe6623da9", "publicationDate": "2008-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090002581.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090002581/downloads/20090002581.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090002581/downloads/20090002581.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090002581/downloads/20090002581.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
