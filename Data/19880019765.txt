The distance of the ice detector 11\nfrom the outer surface 12 need only be close enough to\naccurately sense the presence of any material on the\nouter surface 12.

OPPOSite sides of the first capacitive gauge 16 25\nare formed from the parallel leads 30 and 32. Each of\nthe two leads has Connected reSpeCtiVelY thereto a series of interleaved electrodes 34 and 36. The electrodes\n34 and 36 are p*ndicular leads 30 and 32 and\nto the\nparallel to each other.

This distance is preferably approximately 0.67\nof an inchoThe length ofthis single electrode is approximately two inches.\nBoth first capacitive gauge 16 and second capacitive\ngauge 18 are made from thin conductors with a thick- 55\nness of approximately 0.001 of an inch.\nReferring once again to FIG. 1, fvst capacitive gauge\n16 is connected to first capacitance measuring circuit 24\nand second capacitive gauge 18 is connected to second\ncapacitance measuring circuit 26. The first capacitance 60\nmeasuring circuit 24 is ideatical to second capacitance\nmeasuring circuit 26. Referring now to FIG. 4, first\ncapacitance measuring circuit 2 is shown. A dual timer\n4\nLM556,which is a commonly used circuit and available\nfrom several sources, such as National Semiconductor 65\nCorporation, is used. One of the timers, 42, is used in an\nastable mode to generate 7ps pulses at 1.5 kHz, for\nexample, or pulses at any other similar frequencies,\n\n4\n\nwhich are used to trigger a monostable timer 44. The\ntiming capacitor of monostable timer 44 is the gauge 16.\nThe output from the monostable timer is converted by\nthe low pass filter 46 to produce an output DC signal\nwhich is directly proportional to the capacitance of first\ncapacitive gauge 16.\nReferring now to FIG. 5, a graph of the output voltages from the fmt and second capacitance measuring\ncircuits 24 and 26 for various thicknesses of ice 23\nformed on outer surface 12 is shown. Curve 48 represents the voltage output VIfrom the first capacitance\nmeasuring circuit 24 at a fixed temperature and ice\nimpurity level. Likewise, curve 50 represents the voltage output V2 from the second capacitance measuring\ncircuit 26. At the same fixed configurations, the curves\n48 and 50 will vary with either a temperature change or\nan ice impurity change,\nAn indicated range of interest of ice thickness is\nshown in FIG. 5, in this embodiment approximately\n0 0 of an inch to appro-ately\n.4\n0.42 of an inch. n i s\nrange of interest determines the sizes of both first capacitive gauge 16 and second capacitive gauge 18. ne\nice\nthickness at which the voltage output of a capacitance\nmeasuring circuit levels off for bcreasing ice thickness\nis directly related to the conductor separation for the\nparticular geometry of a given capacitive gauge. First\ncapacitive gauge 16 is selected so that the constant\nmaximum of curve 48 is reached even for the minimum\nice thickness of the range of interest. As noted previously, in this embodiment the electrodes 34 and 36 of\nfirst capacitive gauge 16 have gaps of approximately\n0.012 of an inch between thema Second capacitive\ngauge 18 is selected so that the constant maximum of\nc ~ 50 does not cur &fQPe the mmimum ice thicke\nness sfthe range 0finter-t- A noted previously, in this\ns\nembodiment the two leads 38 and 40 Qf second capacihave a length of approximately two\ntive gauge\ninches and a electrode\ncovers approximately\none-third of the distance between the outer edges 0.67\nof an inch. The space between the electrdes is also 0.67\nof an inch.\nIt k apparent from FIG. 5 that curves 8(9 and 50 do\noutput volbge when the ice thichess is\nnot go to\nzero. This is due to cable and dry gauge capacitance of\nfrrst and second capacitive gauges l6 and\nwhen no\nice 22 is present on outer surface 12. In order to determine the correct output voltage readings for first and\nsecond capacitive gauges 16 and 18, it is necessary to\nreading vO Obtained\nsubtract an\nfrom each gauge under no ice conditions\'\nOnce again to\nfirst capacitance\nmeasuring circuit 24 and second capacitance measuring\ncircuit 26 are connected to offset and dividing circuit\nvOUl\nthis Offset and dividing\n29*The Output\ncircuit 29 for ice conditions is determined by the following equation:\n9\n\'\n\nVO",\n\n=\n\n(V - Voh\n(V - VOh\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V is the voltage output for ice conditions and Vo\nis the initial voltage output for no ice conditions.

Temperature measUIing Circuit 28 determines\nwhether the surface is above or below the freezing\npoint. By logically combidqg the outputs of the measuring circuit 28, a logic circuit (not shown) can deter- 10\nmine when ice 22 is present on outer surface 12. Specifically, when the output of the offset and dividing circuit\n29 indicates that moisture is present and when the output of the temperature measuring circuit 28 indicates\nthat the temperature is below the freezing point, ice 22 15\nis present.\nIn operation, the response of the first and second\ncapacitive gauges 24 and 26 are based on the following\nexplanation. Most insulating solid materials such as\nplastic or epoxy have dielectric constants of about 3 to 20\n5. Pure water and ice have dielectric constants near 80.\nThus, if fmt and second capacitive gauges 24 and 26 are\nembedded near the surface ofthe insulating material 14,\nand if a layer of pure water or ice covers a surface, the\ncapacitance betwen the electrodes will be strongly 25\ninfluenced by the proximity of the high dielectric water\nor ice. The particular influence will depend on the geometry of the electrodes and is also changed depending\non the conductivity of the water. This difference in\ninfluence is seen in FIG. 5. Thus, in the first capacitive U)\ngauge 16 having small conductors and a small gap, there\nis a very large change in signal for a very small thickness of water on ice. In the second capacitive gauge 18\nhaving large electrodes and a relatively large gap, the\nresponse to the presence of ice varies nearly linearly 35\nwith thickness.\nThus, when a logic circuit (not shown) receives an\noutput from the offset and dividing circuit 29 indicating\nthat moisture is present and at the same time receives an\nindication from the temperature measuring circuit 28 40\n(v - V*h\nthat the temperature is below the freezing point, an\nvovr =\n(v - Voh\nindication of the presence of ice is indicated.
