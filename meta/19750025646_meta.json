In addition to the primary steering control task, a subcritical speed tracking task provided a secondary surrogate for trimming the water speed of the craft. The results of helsmen's steering describing function measurements are presented, and some suggestions for their interpretation are offered. The likely steering loop closures comprise heading and lateral displacement for the course keeping task investigated. Also discussed is the manner in which these loop closures were implemented for automatic steering of the surface effect ship. Regardless of the influence of workload, steering technique, water speed and sea state, the helmsmen apparently adopted a disturbance regulation bandwidth of about 0.2 rad/sec for lateral displacement.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750025646, "id": "9757b9744958473484e94e170ef59d94", "publicationName": "NASA.
