b'Methods Reduce Cost, Enhance Quality of Nanotubes\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nPartnership\n\nF\n\nor all the challenges posed by the microgravity\nconditions of space, weight is actually one of the\nmore significant problems NASA faces in the\ndevelopment of the next generation of U.S. space vehicles.\nFor the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s Constellation Program, engineers at\nNASA centers are designing and testing new vessels as\nsafe, practical, and cost-effective means of space travel\nfollowing the eventual retirement of the space shuttle.\nProgram components like the Orion Crew Exploration\nVehicle, intended to carry astronauts to the International\nSpace Station and the Moon, must be designed to specific\nweight requirements to manage fuel consumption and\nmatch launch rocket capabilities; Orion\xe2\x80\x99s gross liftoff\nweight target is about 63,789 pounds. Future space\nvehicles will require even greater attention to lightweight\nconstruction to help conserve fuel for long-range missions\nto Mars and beyond.\nIn order to reduce spacecraft weight without sacrificing\nstructural integrity, NASA is pursuing the development\nof materials that promise to revolutionize not only\nspacecraft construction, but also a host of potential\napplications on Earth. Single-walled carbon nanotubes\nare one material of particular interest. These tubular,\nsingle-layer carbon molecules\xe2\x80\x94100,000 of them braided\ntogether would be no thicker than a human hair\xe2\x80\x94display\na range of remarkable characteristics. Possessing greater\ntensile strength than steel at a fraction of the weight, the\nnanotubes are efficient heat conductors with metallic or\nsemiconductor electrical properties depending on their\ndiameter and chirality (the pattern of each nanotube\xe2\x80\x99s\nhexagonal lattice structure). All of these properties\nmake the nanotubes an appealing material for spacecraft\nconstruction, with the potential for nanotube composites\nto reduce spacecraft weight by 50 percent or more. The\nnanotubes may also feature in a number of other space\nexploration applications, including life support, energy\nstorage, and sensor technologies.\n136\t Industrial Productivity \t\n\nBy increasing the size of its fluidized bed reactors, seen here,\nSouthWest NanoTechnologies Inc. (SWeNT) increased its\ncarbon nanotube production capacity while at the same time\nlowering cost.\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s various efforts with carbon nanotubes have\nmade it a global leader in this field. Among the many\nexamples are Johnson Space Center\xe2\x80\x99s Carbon Nanotube\nProject, which focuses on bulk nanotube production,\npurification, and application, and Goddard Space Flight\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s improved arc discharge method of nanotube\nproduction, developed under the direction of Jeannette\nBenavides (featured in Spinoff 2007 and 2008). While\nthe Agency continues its own research, it partners with\nprivate companies to advance this unique technology for\nuse on Earth as well as among the stars.\n\nOne of the significant challenges involved with taking\nadvantage of single-walled nanotube technology lies in\nhow the nanotubes are made. Typical manufacturing\nmethods are expensive, are not amenable to large scale\nproduction, and can be inefficient, resulting in samples\ncontaining as low as 10\xe2\x80\x9315 percent nanotubes. Costly\nand time-consuming separation procedures are needed\nto sort out nanotubes of the desired diameter, length,\nand chirality. In addition, nanotube samples can be\ntainted with residual catalyst impurities and common\nbyproducts like amorphous carbon and graphite nanofibers. Thus, affordable, largely pure nanotube supplies\nwith tailored properties for research and commercial\nefforts have been lacking.\nTo address these issues, Johnson awarded Phase I and\nII Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts to SouthWest NanoTechnologies Inc. (SWeNT),\nof Norman, Oklahoma, to pursue the development of\na new nanotube production method. Founded in 2001,\nSWeNT is the offshoot of landmark research conducted\nby Daniel Resasco at the University of Oklahoma. Resasco\npioneered a controlled catalytic method for creating\nnanotubes that is inherently scalable for mass production. During Resasco\xe2\x80\x99s cobalt-molybdenum catalytic\nprocedure\xe2\x80\x94known as the CoMoCAT process\xe2\x80\x94pure\ncarbon monoxide (CO) flows through suspended cobalt\nand molybdenum catalyst particles in a device called a\ntubular fluidized bed reactor. At certain temperatures and\npressure, the nanotubes are grown as the CO decomposes\ninto carbon and carbon dioxide. By controlling the conditions and catalyst within the reactor, Resasco was able to\ngrow significant, highly selective amounts of high-quality\nnanotubes within a couple of hours.\nUsing the NASA SBIR funding, SWeNT demonstrated that increasing the size of the fluidized bed reactor\nplatform increased production capacity while decreasing\nSpinoff 2009\n\ncost. The SBIR support also provided another welcome\noutcome: higher quality nanotubes.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we invested in larger scale equipment, we\nalso invested in more automation, instrumentation, and\nprocess controls,\xe2\x80\x9d says SWeNT CEO David Arthur.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat resulted in significant improvement in quality\nat the same time that we were expanding capacity and\nreducing cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProduct Outcome\nIn 2008, SWeNT opened a commercial-scale nanotube manufacturing plant. Since beginning operations at\nthe 18,000-square-foot facility, Arthur says, the company\nhas experienced a hundredfold increase in production\ncoupled with a tenfold reduction in cost. SWeNT now\noffers two single-walled carbon nanotube product lines,\nas well as customized orders for the company\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds\nof customers.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are one of the only companies that is able to\nsupply these materials in commercial quantities in North\nAmerica,\xe2\x80\x9d says Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of this would have happened without the original NASA SBIR funds to prove\nour production methods.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThose production methods are the key to increasing\noutput while lowering cost, Arthur notes. By controlling\nnanotube synthesis, SWeNT can selectively grow the\nnanotubes its clients want while avoiding an expensive,\nwasteful, time-consuming, and non-scalable sorting\nprocess. Using the CoMoCAT process, the company\ndelivers nanotube orders that are routinely 95 percent\ncarbon in composition, with more than 90 percent of\nthat carbon in the form of nanotubes\xe2\x80\x94all above typical\nindustry outcomes.\nSWeNT\xe2\x80\x99s controlled synthesis capabilities have allowed\nit to provide customers with customized nanotubes for\na wide range of new and developing technologies. The\ncompany has supplied diameter-specific nanotubes for\nuse in reinforcing carbon fibers, with the potential to\nyield a material 17 times stronger than Kevlar for use in\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nbulletproof body and vehicle armor. It is working with\naerospace and nanomaterials clients to produce chiralityspecific nanotubes\xe2\x80\x94the goal, Arthur says, is to create\nthe most electrically conductive carbon nanotubes in the\nworld\xe2\x80\x94for nanocomposite cable wiring to replace standard metal wiring in commercial aircraft. The company\nis exploring the use of its semiconducting nanotubes in\nthe form of an ink, enabling the production of low-cost,\nprintable electronics; applications include radio frequency\nidentification, biological and chemical sensors, and electronic displays. Arthur foresees SWeNT nanotubes also\nenabling more affordable solar photovoltaic panels and\nsolid-state lighting products that could have a dramatic\nimpact on energy consumption.\nSWeNT has set its sights on expanding its capabilities to also produce small-diameter, multiwalled carbon\n\nnanotubes for niche electrical\nThe\napplications, as well as building\non its current single-walled nanocompany has\ntube success.\nexperienced a\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur vision is to once again\nhundredfold\nincrease our production scale a\nincrease in\nhundredfold and enjoy another\ntenfold reduction in cost,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nproduction\nArthur.
