b'SHOCK PAIR OBSERVATION J. K. Chao, V. Formisano and P. C. Hedgecock\n\n-\n\nOn day 84, 1969, the HEOS 1 satellite observed a shock pair connected with a plasma ABSTRACT\nbulk velocity increase from 400 to 750 km/sec. Both shocks were fast shocks. The\nforward shock had a Mach number of 1.7, the reverse shock had Mfast = 1.4. The time\ninterval between the two shocks was 7 hr, 10 min. The time delay between HEOS 1 and\nExplorer 35 reverse shock observation (20 ? 6 min) agrees with the computed time delay\n(11 k4min).\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe HEOS 1 satellite was launched December 5, 1968,\nand provided good plasma and magnetic data for almost\n2 years. Because of its elongated orbit, it was able to\nobserve the solar wind for a high percentage of time.\nPlasma and magnetic data concerning a shock pair\nobservation are shown in this paper.\nThe shock pairs have been theoretically studied by\nrectly from sudden impulses observed in the ground station magnetograms by Razdan et al. 119651, but to our\nknowledge no direct observation has been published. The\nforward shocks have been observed more frequently in\nthe solar wind. A reverse shock was recently reported by\nBurlaga [ 19701.\nInstrument details and data analysis are reported by\nBonetti et al.

This increase starts\ngradually from 0400UT (400km/sec) to 0645\n(450 km/sec) then shows a complicated discontinuous\nstructure.

No relevant velocity change is observed for\nV when the shock is observed, while a large disconti,\nnuity is observed 12 min before the shock: Va goes from\n432 km/sec (0615 UT) to 515 km/sec (0632 UT) (two\nmeasurements are missed in between). This abrupt\nincrease of V,, however, is observed together with a\ndecrease of N,, if we compare the N , value observed\ntwo measurements before; since the data gap is partially\ndue to low a particles fluxes, an increase of N , together\nwith the increase of velocity V cannot be excluded. An\n,\nincrease of Na is observed for a short period in\ncoincidence with the proton shock.\nNo electron measurements were available. However,\nassuming for charge neutrality Ne 2 N p and\nTe = 1.5X IO5 " K on one side of the considered discontinuities, the electron temperature was computed on the\nother side in order to balance the pressure on both sides\nof the discontinuities [BurIaga and Chao, 19711. As\nshown in table 1, four out of eight cases gave a very\nreasonable electron temperature on side two; these were\ncalled tangential discontinuities. In three cases, the\nelectron temperature became negative, meaning that the\npressure on side two was already much higher than on\nside one. The 0645 UT event will be shown later, as a\nforward shock. The last discontinuity needed an increase\nof the electron temperature of a factor of 20 on side two\n\nfor the total pressure being balanced. The expected side\ntwo electron temperature is therefore very unlikely. This\ndiscontinuity will be shown later as a reverse shock.\nWe are left with two discontinuities observed at\n0930 UT and 1155 UT for which it is difficult to\nbalance the pressure. As we will see later from the\nmagnetic field, both of them have a very different\ncharacter as observe\'d by HEOS 1 and Explorer 35.\nTherefore, we may tentatively conclude that these are\ntwo discontinuities in a nonsteady state. However, wave\nenergy should also be taken into account in balancing\nthe energy density across the discontinuities.\nMAGNETlC FIELD OBSERVATIONS\n\nHEOS 1 magnetic field observations are shown in figure\n3. The satellite had just crossed the laminar structure of\nearth-bow shock studied by Formisano et al. [1970b].\nThe spikes observed in the magnetic field intensity at\n0220 UT and 0357 UT are very short magnetosheath\nobservations due to the fast moving bow shock.\nThe magnetic field intensity shows a very clear\nstructure that can be described as follows:\n1. The preceding "square wave." From 0339 UT to\n0548 UT magnetic field intensity is very large (147)\nand very steady. A sharp tangential discontinuity is\nobserved at 0425 UT; 0 changes from +20\xc2\xb0 to 30"\nwhile B remains constant. It is not clear whether this\nstructure is related to the proton bulk velocity\ngradient and the shock pair.\n\n437\n\n100.\n\nKrn\nsee\n\n80.\n\nWP\n\nTHERMAL\n\nW*\n\n60.\n\nSPtxD\n\n40.\n\n20\n\n-\n\n0.\nNp\n\nNd.\n\nP ! rn3\n\nn\n\n14.\n\n1.4\n\n12 1 2 .\n1.0 10\n\nNUMBER\n\nD E NSlTY\n0.4\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\na\n\nlo\n\nDAY\n\n1\n\n350\n0302\n\n0406\n\n0510\n\n00\n61\n\nBULK\nVELOCITY\n\n0705\n\n0809\n\nU.T.\n\nDAY 04, 1969\n\nFigure 2.

Magnetic field intensity shows the\nforward shock at 0645 UT when the field magnitude\nabruptly changes from 107 to 187. After the shock,\nB increases until it reaches 227; later at 081 1 UT, B\ndecreases suddenly to 14.57. From 081 1 to 0930 UT\nboth magnetic field intensity and direction are very\nturbulent and show large fluctuations. From 0930 to\n1155 UT only the magnetic field direction shows\nlarge fluctuations.

The position of the satellite is shown in\nfigure 5; it was around the moon at -79" from the\nearth-sun line on the evening side.\nExplorer 35 magnetic field observations show the same\ngeneral configuration as for HEOS 1. However, a few\nimportant differences should be noted:\n1. The reverse shock is observed at UT 1415, 20 min\nlater than the HEOS 1 observation.\n2. The second "depression" of the magnetic field\nintensity, clearly identified by the changes of the\ndirection, is observed between UT 1234 and\n1303:39+33 min later than HEOS 1. The amplitude\nof this magnetic field intensity depression is now\n2e2.57 instead of 57.\n3. A data gap between 0606 and 0652 UT does not\nallow a comparison between time observation of the\ntwo satellites for the forward shock.\n4. The first "depression" of the magnetic field intensity\nis only partially observed because of a data gap; the\nobserved part looks different for the HEOS 1 observations.\n\n!\n\nMOON S H A D O W\nI\nI\n\nO\n)\n\nI\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n0200\n\n1\n\n;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0300\n\nI\n\n0400\n\no500\n\no600\n\n0700\n\n&\n\nA\n\nI\n\n*\xe2\x80\x980900\n\n7000 \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x981?oo\nDAY\n\n1200\n\nBoo\n\n14U2\n\n1500\n\n1600\n\nuT\n\n84,1969\n\nFigure 4.

We will call this set of parameters the\ncomputed parameters associated with the discontinuity.\nWhen these computed parameters are within the uncertainty of the corresponding average values, we have\nshown that the present event is a shock.\nIn table 2 we use the RTN coordinates in which the\nR axis is out from the sun and parallel to the sun-earth\nline, the T axis is the direction of the motion of the\nearth, the R-T plane is parallel to the ecliptic, and the\nN axis is northward and perpendicular to the ecliptic.\n\nThe polar coordinates are also used in table 2. The\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomputed parameters\xe2\x80\x9d and the measured average values\nare given. The close agreement shows that the observed\nparameters and changes are consistent with the Rankine-Hugoniot equations.\nIn principle, using the Rankine-Hugoniot equations, it\nis possible t o solve for 1 of the 12 known parameters as\na function of the remaining 11 [Chao and Olbert,\n19701.\nIt should be noted that the N component of the solar\nwind bulk velocity was not available, therefore we\nassume that vN2 is zero. We can solve for v1 as a\nfunction of ( B 1 ,B z , V,, nl,nz). Then, the measured\nparameters B 1 , B 2 , V 2 , nl, n2 are allowed to vary\nindependently within their uncertainties for computing\nthe V1 value.

HEOS A and Explorer 35 relative positions\nat the forward (F) and reverse ( R ) shock observation.\nThe X-Y plane is the plane of the ecliptic, the 2 component is also given each time. Dashed lines are the intersections of the two-plane assumed shock surfaces with a\nplane parallel to the ecliptic plane.\nthen this computed value can be regarded as a prediction. Table 2 shows that the predicted and observed\nvalues of VI are in good agreement.\nIt should be noted that the solution gives a reasonable\ncomponent of solar wind bulk velocity perpendicular to\nthe ecliptic plane, unknown from the data. This shock is\na perpendicular shock for the following reasons:\n1. The magnetic field does not change in direction\nacross the discontinuity but change in strength by a\nfactor of 1.9 0.1.\n2. The ratio of number densities across the perpendicular shock equals the ratio of magnetic field strength\n(i.e., B1/B2 N l / N 2 )as it should.\n=\nThe shock velocity in an RTN frame of reference is\ngiven in table 3 together with other basic shock\nparameters. In this table, Vs is the shock velocity in\n\n*\n\n440\n\nRTN coordinate, ?z is the shock normal in RTN and solar\necliptic coordinates 0 , $ and V i is the normal\n,\nI\ncomponent of the flow to the shock front expressed in\nthe shock frame of reference; 0 ~is the angle between\n, ~\nB and ; ; M A is the Mach number based on the total\nmagnetic field intensity and\nMfast is the Mach\nnumber based on the fast mode magnetosonic wave\npropagating along the shock normal. The fast Mach\nnumber is 1.7; that is, it fulfills the necessary condition\nfor a shock pair to develop ( M > 1.5) found by\nHundhausen and Gentry [ 1969J .\nFrom the shock normal and shock speed the time\ndelay between HEOS 1 and Explorer 35 observations\nwas computed.\nThe Explorer 35 shock distance was 14.4 Re * R e and\nthe time delay predicted is 2.6 min. The time delay\nobserved, because of data gap, has to be\n-39 < T > 7 min; therefore there is no inconsistency.\nFigure 5 shows the intersection of the shock surface\nwith a plane parallel to the ecliptic and passing through\nthe HEOS 1 position.\nThe best-fit procedure also has been used for the reverse\nshock, with very good agreement obtained between\npredicted and observed parameters (table 4). The shock\nMach number was 1.4. The shock was moving backward\nalong its normal with a speed of 160 km/sec. The Alfvdn\nMach number was now computed using only the normal\ncomponent of B to the shock surface.\nFrom the shock normal and shock velocity the time\ndelay between HEOS 1 and Explorer 35 observations has\nbeen computed. The Explorer 35 to shock distance was\n40.8 Re and the time delay predicted was 1 1 min. It\nshould be remembered, however, that because of the\ngeometry of the problem (fig. 5) an error as small as 7"\nfor the shock normal would give 2 min of error on the\ntime delay. Another -2 min can be attributed to a 10\npercent error on the shock velocity. The time delay is\ntherefore 1 1 + 4 min. The observed time delay is\n20 ?I. 6 min.\nFrom the basic shock parameters we see that in this\ncase electron temperature almost does not change across\nthe discontinuity. The forward and reverse shocks\ncannot be tangential discontinuities. If they were tangential discontinuities the predicted time delay between\nHEOS 1 and Explorer 35 disagrees with the measured\ndelay time.\nThe best-fit method gives a possible value for the\nplasma anisotropy on both sides of the discontinuity:\nE = 1 - (011 -01)/2 is 0.0 in the preshock region and\nbecomes 0.6 in the postshock region. This parameter had\nbeen assumed equal to 1 for the forward shock analysis.\n\nTable 2.\n\nComputed and averaged parameters f o r the forward shock\n\nAveral values\n\nComputed values\nParameter\nB\n\nPreshock\n\nPostshock\n\nPreshock\n\nPostshock\n\n-2.3, -13.2, -13.4\n\n-1.4, -8.1, -5.7\n\n-2.3, -13.2, -13.4\n\n10(-35", 80")\n\n19(-35", 80\')\n\n10(-35", 80\')\n\n19(-35", 80")\n\n429,0, -19\n\n504, -25,O\n\n429, -6,O\n\n430 (-2.5", -0")\n\n(gamma)\n\n-1.4, -8.1, -5.7\n\n510(0",2.1")\n\n430 (0", 0.5")\n(*)\n\nV, km/sec\n\nN , p/crn3\n\n6 .OO\n\nW, km/sec\n\n11.0\n\n40\n\n504, -25,O\n510 (0", -2.7")\n(*)\n\n6.0t20%\n405 10 km/sec\n\n60\n\n12.5+20%\n60k10 km/sec\n\nExplorer 35 to shock distance 14.4 R e .\nExplorer 35 to HEOS 1 time delay predicted 2.6 min.\nExplorer 35 to HEOS 1 observed time delay -31 < ~ < 7 min.\n(*) without aberration.\n\nTable 3.\n\n1\n\ntI\n\nBasic shock parameters\n\nForward shock\n\nVS\nkm/sec\n\nReverse shock\nI\n\nI1\n\n548,-142,130\n\nI\n\n251,-257,71\n0.684, -0.703,0.19C\n11". 134.0\'\n\nPreshock\n\nPostshock\n\nvi\n\n185\n\n100\n\neB, ti\n\n90"\n\n90"\n\nMA\nMfast\n~ ~ ~\n\nt\n\n2.07(*)\n\nPostshoc\n\n:99\n\n166\n\n2+1\n\n1k1\n\nOS(*)\n\n1.7\n\nPreshock\n\n0.67\n\n1 2*1 5\n0\n1\n\n"\n\n32\n~ 1\n\n1\n\n(*) Using the intermagnetic fieId intensity.\n\n44 1\n\nTable 4.\n\nComputed and averaged parameters for the reverse shock\n\nI\n\nComputed values\nPreshock\n\nB\n\n8.9,0.0,3.3\n\n(gamma)\n\n9.5 (20\xc2\xb0, 180")\n734, -123,O\n\nPostshock\n\nI\n\nAverage values\nPreshock\n\nPostshock\n\n14.2,5.8,+5.6\n17.1 (20", 202")\n\n9.5 (20\xc2\xb0, 185")\n\n17.5 (20\xc2\xb0, 210\')\n\n750 (O", -6.5O)\n(*)\n\n710 (0", +lo)\n\n723, -9 2\n\nV; km/sec\n745 .O (O", -6.5")\n\nN, P/cm3\n\nW, kmlsec\n\n2.3\n\n60\n\n715 (0.1", 0.7" )\n\n4.0\n\n2.5220%\n\n70\n\n60k 10 km/sec\n\n(*I\n4.0+,20%\n\n7@ 10 km/sec\n\nI\n\nExplorer 35 to shock distance 40.8 Re e . 5 R e .\nHEOS 1to Explorer 35 predicted time delay 11 min *4.\nHEOS 1to Explorer 35 observed time delay 20 min 26.\n(*) without aberration.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA shock pair observed by HEOS 1 and Explorer 35 has\nbeen studied. This shock pair also produces the classical\n\' and SI-pair in the H component of the geomagnetic\nI\nS\nfield reported by most equatorial ground stations.\nThe shock analysis described by Chao [1970] has\ngiven a Mach number of 1.7 for the forward shock and\n1.4 for the reverse shock. It seems therefore verified the\nnecessary condition suggested by Hundhausen and\nGentry [1969] for the forward shock Mach number\n(Mp > 1S).\nWe suggest that the two magnetic field intensity\n"depressions" observed between 081 1 and 0930 UT,\n1155 and 1230 UT, be interpreted as decay of two discontinuities where the shocks were generated. Indeed the\ngeneral structure of two shocks with two "depressions"\nin the magnetic field intensity has been verified on\nPioneer 8 data. A statistical study made by some of the\nauthors is in progress. With this assumption, and using\nthe shock speeds relative to the ambient plasma (154\nkm/sec for the forward shock, 160 km/sec for the\nreverse shock) it is possible to compute the distance\nfrom the satellite where the shocks were generated.\nThe reverse shock has been observed by HEOS 1 1.5-2\nhr after the assumed generation point. This time interval\ncorresponds to a distance of 4.9 lo6 km using an average\n\n442\n\nplasma velocity of 680 km/sec and has been covered by\nthe shock with its velocity of 160 km/sec in 510 min,\nwhich corresponds to a distance of 20.8 l o 6 km using\nthe average plasma velocity.\nFor the forward shock, assuming as a generation point\nthe discontinuity observed at 0930 UT, we obtain an age\nof 536 min corresponding to a distance of 16.1 I O 6 km,\nusing an average plasma speed of 500 km/sec.\nThe two shocks appear to be generated within the\nsolar wind at a distance of 0.13 or 0.10 AU from the\nsatellite toward the sun.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nW are very grateful to Drs.
