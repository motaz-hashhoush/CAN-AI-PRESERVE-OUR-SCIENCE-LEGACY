Computational science is based on numerical simulations of mathematical models derived from theory. But each individual simulation is like a hypothetical experiment; initial conditions are specified, and the result is a record of the observed conditions. Experiments can be simulated for situations that can not really be created or controlled. Results impossible to measure can be computed.. Even for observable values, computed samples are typically much denser. Numerical simulations also extend scientific exploration where the mathematics is analytically intractable. Numerical simulations are used to study phenomena from subatomic to intergalactic scales and from abstract mathematical structures to pragmatic engineering of everyday objects. But computational science methods would be almost useless without visualization. The obvious reason is that the huge amounts of data produced require the high bandwidth of the human visual system, and interactivity adds to the power. Visualization systems also provide a single context for all the activities involved from debugging the simulations, to exploring the data, to communicating the results. Most of the presentations today have their roots in image processing, where the fundamental task is: Given an image, extract information about the scene. Visualization has developed from computer graphics, and the inverse task: Given a scene description, make an image. Visualization extends the graphics paradigm by expanding the possible input. The goal is still to produce images; the difficulty is that the input is not a scene description displayable by standard graphics methods. Visualization techniques must either transform the data into a scene description or extend graphics techniques to display this odd input. Computational science is a fertile field for visualization research because the results vary so widely and include things that have no known appearance. The amount of data creates additional challenges for both hardware and software systems. Evaluations of visualization should ultimately reflect the insight gained into the scientific phenomena. So making good visualizations requires consideration of characteristics of the user and the purpose of the visualization. Knowledge about human perception and graphic design is also relevant. It is this breadth of knowledge that stimulates proposals for multidisciplinary visualization teams and intelligent visualization assistant software. Visualization is an immature field, but computational science is stimulating research on a broad front.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020024704, "endDate": "1995-02-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "American Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) Annual Meeting, Imaging Sciences Seminar", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "ebdad3e73d504c0ebbaf9f991ef4ed51", "startDate": "1995-02-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020024704, "id": "9f67ddd04ce844209b5135460e7c0d6e", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
