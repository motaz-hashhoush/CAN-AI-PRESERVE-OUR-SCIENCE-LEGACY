The transducer is arranged\nas a bridge with micrometer valves, R 1 and R 2, in one\npair of legs and capillary tubes, R 3 and R41 in the other\npair.\nWhen the capillaries, R 3 and R41 are exposed to different temperatures, an output pressure signal P\n\nis developed across junctions A and B. The magnitude\nof this signal is a function of the relative change in the\nfluid inpedances of the capillaries. Since the impedances increase as a function of temperature in a known\nmanner, the transducer can be used as a differential\ntemperature indicator; it can be used as a direct temperature indicator when one of the capillary legs is\nmaintained at a known constant temperature.
