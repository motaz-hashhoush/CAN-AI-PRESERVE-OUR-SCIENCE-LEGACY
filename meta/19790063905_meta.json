The three engine programs are: (1) engine component improvement, directed at current engines, (2) energy efficient engine, directed at new turbofan engines, and (3) advanced turboprops, directed at technology for advanced turboprop-powered aircraft with cruise speeds to Mach 0.8. Unique propulsion system interactive ties to the airframe resulting from engine design features to reduce fuel consumption are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the advanced turboprop since it offers the largest potential fuel savings of the three propulsion programs and also has the strongest interactive ties to the airframe.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790063905, "endDate": "1979-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "88430ae8334346d3b02f57e6deba891b", "id": "f7c5c718514541c681388aa5b37bd19b"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aircraft Systems and Technology Meeting", "location": "New York, NY", "id": "88430ae8334346d3b02f57e6deba891b", "startDate": "1979-08-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790063905, "id": "3ce2eb43c17244c7b7d2d45fe8e49804", "publicationDate": "1979-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
