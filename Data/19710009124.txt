These devices provide\nmechanisms which prevent propagation of the explosive\nor heat and pressure output of the initiator unit to the\nrest of the explosives system such as the detonators, igniters, etc. The electromechanical safe-arm device also\nprovides electrical safety to the enclosed initiator by disconnecting its electrical inputs from any outside source\nand by maintaining a short circuit and internal ground\nacross the initiator bridge wire or heater element until\nthe unit is placed in an armed position.\nPrior designs of electromechanical and mechanical safearm devices are normally constructed to withstand the\nrated output of the enclosed initiator of heat, pressure\nand shrannel. while in the safe position without allowing\npropagagon to occur or without exploding and creating\nhazards to anyone handling O r installing the unit. These\nprior art devices have inherent disadvantages in that in\norder to withstand the forces generated by the internal\ninitiator, the unit must be large and heavy as compared\nto the parameters of a single initiator. In addition, the\nsize and weight requirements of the safe-arm prior art\ndevices genezxilly restrict their usage to only those vehicles\no r exlplosives systems where spaGe and weight are not too\nirnprtant. Since it is difficult to adapt these units fQr genera1 use, bemuse of the weight and space limitations, they\nare not presently used on sounding rocket systems o r for\nproviding potection on ancillary explosive systems on\nboth small axld large rocket vehicles and the use thereof\nfs almost entirely restricted $0 destruct systws and to\nvery large military rocket motor systems.\n\n30\n\n3.;\n\n\'IO\n\n45\n\n5o\n\n.\nW\n\n"V\n\n8o\n\n\'*\n\n65\n\nF\nS\nS\n-\n\n3,5( ,747\n4\n\n3\n\nFIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of the electrical arming and firing circuit of the present invention.\nReferring now to the drawings wherein like reference\nnumerals designate identical or corresponding parts\nthroughout the several views, and more particularly to\nFIG. 1 there is shown an initiator unit according to the\npresent invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10. Initiator unit 10 includes a housing 11\nhaving an open threaded end 13 and a connector pin protective sleeve 15 provided at the opposite end. The major\nlength of ignition housing 11 is provided with a\nlongitudinal bore 14 extending from threaded end 13 into\nthe housing unit. A diametrically opposed bore 17 (FIG.\n2) is provided through housing 11 and intersects bore 14\nadjacent the internal end thereof. Housing 11 is also provided with a counterbore 19 adjacent the end of longitudinally extending bore 14 as will be further explained\nhereinafter.\nAs shown more particularly in FIG. 3, a pair of electromagnet pole faces, designated by reference numerals 21\nand 23, are disposed in counterbore 19 and each of which\nis provided with a coil of electrically conductive wire\naround the electromagnet core thereof as designated respectively by reference numerals 25 and 27. Electromagnets 21 and 23 are retained in position within counterbore 19 by means of a rotor receiving unit 29 which is\nslidably received within bore 14 of housing 11. Rotor\nreceiving unit 29 also has four integrally secured electrical leads attached thereto. These two pair of electrical\nleads are designated respectively as 31 and 33 (FIG. l ) ,\n35 and 37 (FIG. 2). Leads 31 and 33 serve to provide\nan electrically parallel connection to electric coils 25 and\n27, respectively, while leads 35 and 37 serve to provide\nelectrical connection to the ignition charge as will be further explained hereinafter. Rotor receiving unit 29 is also\nprovided with a diametrically opposed bore 39 of essentially the same diameter as bore 17 in housing 11. When\nplaced in the position as shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2,\nrotor receiving unit 29 slidably receives the rotor unit 41.\nRotor 41 is provided with a diametrically opposed stepped\nbore 43 intermediate the length thereof with the smaller\nstep thereof being provided with threads 45 throughout\nits length. An ignition bead or primer mix 47 is disposed\nin a suitable threaded cup 49 and threadingly positioned\nwithin threaded step 45 of rotor 41. Threaded cup 49\nmay be composed of any suitable plastic or nonconductive material. A bridge wire is disposed within primer\nmixed 47 in a conventional manner and connected by way\nof lead wires 51 and 53 to a pair of electrical contacts\n55 and 57 disposed on the exterior circumference of rotor\n41. As shown in FIe. 2, when rotor 41 is disposed in the\narmed condition the electrical contacts 55 and 57 will\nmake electrical connection respectively with the contacts\nof elecWica1 leads 35 and 37.\nAs shown more particularly in FIG. 2 and 3, a pair of\npermanent magnets 59 and 61 are provided integrally\nsecured to opposite ends of rotor 41. The end faces of\neach magnet 59 and 61 are provided on an arc serving to\nprovide a continuous circumferential surface with the\nrest of rotor unit 41. As shown more particularly in FIG.\n5 the ends o the electromagnets are of concave configuraf\ntion so as to receive the arc surface of magnets 59 and 61\ntherein when rotor 45 is moved to the armed position.\nEach magnet 59 and 61 is provided with an axle for\nrotor 41 and as designated by reference numerals 63\nand 65. Diametrically opposed bore 17 in housing 11 is\nclosed by suitable end closures 67 and \'69, threadingly or\notherwise conventionally sealed to housing 11, and serving as bearing structures for axles 63 and 65, respectively.\nAs shown more particularly in FIG. 4, end closure 69 is\nprovided with suitable indicia thereon. A pointer 71,\nwhich is conventionally attached to axle 65, serves to\npoint to the indicia on closure 69 to indicate the position\nof rotor 41 when it is in the safe and armed condition and\n\nto manually reposition rotor 41 in safe position when so\ndesired.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nASSEMBLY\nFor assemblying the initiator 10 of the present invention, housing 11 which may be formed by any conventional cast, molding or milling operation and provided\nwith the necessary bores and counterbores therein for receiving the electrical leads 31, 33, 35 and 37, rotor receiving unit 29, eIectromagnets 21 and 23, and end closures 67 and 68. Electromagnets 21 and 23 are electrically connected to leads 31 and 33 and placed in position\nwithin counterbore 19 in housing 11 with rotor receiving\nunit 29 being slidably received through bore 14 so as to\nmaintain the electromagnets in position. As ,mentioned\nhereinbefore, electrical leads 31, 33, 35 and 37 are integrally secured to rotor receiving unit 29 and adapted to\nbe received by suitable insulated bores within housing 11\nwhen the rotor receiving unit 29 is placed in position.\nLeads 31 and 33 remain internally connected to electromagnets 25 and 27 when the rotor receiving unit 29 is\nplaced in position. Rotor unit 41 with its primer charge\nhaving previously been inserted therein is slidably received through diametrically opposed bore 17 in housing\n11 and bore 39 within rotor receiving unit 29. Rotor 41\nis positioned within housing 11 in the unarmed or safe\ncondition with the electrical contacts 55 and 57 thereon\nbeing shorted out against rotor receiving unit 29. End\nclosures 67 and 69 are then placed about axle 63 and 65,\nrespectively, and pointer 71 attached to axle 65 to indicate the rotor is in the safe condition. A suitable propagating charge or explosive train 73 contained, for example, in plastic cup 75 is then slidably positioned within\nbore 14 of housing 11 so as to be in alinement with primer 47 when the primer charge is ignited. The initiator unit\n10 is then in condition to be employed in any suitable\ninitiating system.\nOPERATION\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\nThe operation of the initiating unit 10 of the present\ninvention is now believed apparent but will further be\nexplained in reference to the schematic circuit diagram of\nFIG. 6 . As described hereinbefore electrical leads 31 and\n33 are provided in electrical connection with the electrical coils 25 and 27 disposed respectively about the electromagnets 21 and 23 and serve to provide the arming energy\nto initiator unit 10. When a suitable current is provided\nthrough leads 31 and 33, as for example when switch SI\nis closed, electromagnets 21 and 23 are actuated through\ncoils 25 and 27 to influence the rotation of rotor 41 from\nthe safe position shown in FIG. 1 to the armed position\nshown in FIG. 2 through the influence of the attached\nmagnets 59 and 61. This armed position is indicated by\nexteriorly disposed pointer 71 provided on axle 65 of\nrotor 41 and removes rotor contacts 55 and 57 from\ntheir ground to a closed position and mated with the\ncontacts formed by electric leads 35 and 37. In the event\nit is desired not to fire the initiator at this time a reverse\npolarity current may be applied to leads 31 and 33 causing rotation of rotor 41 in the reverse position to its safe\ncondition where ignition bead 47 is again shorted. Alternatively, pointer 71 may be manually turned from the\narmed position indicated in FIG. 4 to that position shown\nin dotted lines therein to the safe position to provide the\ninitiator 10 again safe with primer charge 47 being shorted\nout. However, in most instances, once the initiator unit\nis armed it will be desrable to fire the initiator unit 10\nand electrical current will be applied to electrical leads\n35 and 37 as, for exajmple, by closing switch S , to send\nz\ncurrent flow through contacts 55 and 57 and leads 51 and\n53 to cause heating of the bridge wire within primer 47\nto thereby heat or explode the bridge wire and cause\nignition or detonation of primer mix 47 with subsequent\nignition or detonation of the main explosive train 73 leading to the system in which firing is desired.\n\n3,500,747\n5\n\nWhen it k desired to utilize the initiator 10 as a relay\ni\ntype firing system, switch S2 would be closed first in order\nthat upon actuation of switch SI the Primer charge 47\nwould be ignited siimultaneouslyupon being moved fo the\narmed position.\nAlthough the invention has been described in regard to\na specific knition system, it is to be understood that, by\nthe substitution of specific type charges for primmer charge\n47 and the explosive train 73,the initiator 10 of the present invention may be adapted for the initiator u& i any\nn\nexplosive or ignition type system.\nThe advantages of the present invention are now believed apparent. Specifically, the present invention provides both electrical and mechanical safety systems internal to a normal size electroexplosive initiator or squib 15\nwhich prevent initiation or propagation of the initiator\ndue to any external forces acting thereon. The electrical\narrangement internal to the initiator of the present invention provides complete protection from accidental ignition by electrical, electrostatic or R-F sources. In addi- 20\ntion, the internal mechanical safety features of the present invention block the initiator propagation at a point\nwhere the explosive energy is normally at its lowest level\nrather than at some point later in the explosive train\nwhere the energy levels become much greater. Also, the 25\nrelay type action capable of the safe-arm mechanism of\nthe present invention provides an alternate high-speed\nmethod of firing this device.\nFor these applications where it is desirable to provide\ncomplete protection, as for example during flight of a 30\nvehicle, the unit would remain in the safe condition with\nvoltage veing supplied the initiator output pins 35 and 37\nprior to arming. Firing would then be accomplished by the\narming command to the safe-arm initiator through pins\n31 and 33. This mode of operation would be especially 35\ndesirable in manned vehicle systems where an early or\nunplanned firing would be disastrous. The delay time\nrequired for this type of alinement and firing is approximately 30 milliseconds which is comparable with existing\nfiring relays based on measurements made on a specific 40\nembodiment of the invention as described herein. This\nmode of operation, thus, in effect, combines the initiator,\nthe firing relay and the inter-connecting cable into a single\nunit thereby greatly improving circuit reliability and\nsafety.\nAs described hereinbefore, certain features of the pres- 45\nent invention provide flexibility in selecting the inputoutput characteristics and for low-cost quality assurance\ntesting. Thus, the initiation charge or primer 47 which is\npackeged in a bead within its separate, easily replaceable, 5o\nthreaded cup 49, provides for testing of this charge\nseparatelyfrom the main initiator unit to thereby provide\na low-cost assurance test of the initiator unit. This low\ncost ita is readily variable with power and resistance\nrequirements suitable to the proposed systems usage. The 55\noutput charge 73 is also flexible in that both quantity and\nquality, that is, detonation or deflagration type explosive\ntrains can be carried within the capability of bore 14\nwithin igniter housing 11. Since both the primer and output charge are Iow-cost, they can be purchased in large\nquantities for qualification testing and these tests per- 6o\nformed in fixtures to verify their reliability. Thus, SAFTI\n(an acronym for the safe-arm firing-type initiator of the\npresent invention) can be qualified using non-destructive\ntesting techiques applicable to standard relays.\nModifications of the present invention would include, 65\nfor example, in a purely mechanical system, the rotor\ncould be spring-driven to armed position with a suitable\nlanyard serving to release the spring pressure to permit\nthe drive of the motor rotor to its armed position. This 70\nwould involve a simple modification of the end closure\nbearings to provide a driving spring for rotor 41 with a\nsuitable lanyard release. mechanism being disposed on\npointer 71 or a suitable extension of axle 65. Also rotor\n41 could be spring-loaded to the safe position and be 75\n\n6\nadapted to return to safe position when rotor drive coil\nvoltage is removed giving unit t h relay type action.\nModification of the end closure bearings and safe arm\nindicator to provide the spring and removal of the external indicator would readily accomplish this type of modification with the unit being provided with a vacuum seal\nto prevent out-gassing. In addition to the above, the use\nof dual bridge wires and dual drive coil design is readily\nfeasible and may be incorporated in the present invention.\nThere are obviou,usly many o a e r Jnodifications and variations of the present invention readily apparent to those\nskilled in the art in the light of the above teachings.\nWhat is claimed as new and desired to be secured by\nLetters patent of the United States is:\n1.
