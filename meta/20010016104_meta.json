It is a major player in the climate of the north polar region and has a variable sea ice cover that tends to increase its sensitivity to climate change. Its temperature, salinity, and ice cover have all undergone changes in the past several decades, although it is uncertain whether these predominantly reflect long-term trends, oscillations within the system, or natural variability. Major changes include a warming and expansion of the Atlantic layer, at depths of 200-900 m, a warming of the upper ocean in the Beaufort Sea, a considerable thinning (perhaps as high as 40%) of the sea ice cover, a lesser and uneven retreat of the ice cover (averaging approximately 3% per decade), and a mixed pattern of salinity increases and decreases.", "title": "Arctic Ocean", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010016104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Parkinson, Claire L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "3d075041a0af40aea7c1e766f420f9a6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20010016104, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zukor, Dorothy J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "2959ac6361184b46a6575c6589dae3ba"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010016104, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010016104, "id": "38a7e3884cc94949befd625c579aa451", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010016104.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010016104/downloads/20010016104.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010016104/downloads/20010016104.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010016104/downloads/20010016104.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
