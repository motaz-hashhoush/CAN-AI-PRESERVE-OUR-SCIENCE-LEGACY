They are issued to encourage\ncommercial application. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the National Technical Information\nService, Springfield, Virginia 22151.

The Deep Space Network was\nformally established when two additional 85-ft antenna Deep Space Stations became operational at\nWoomera, Australia in December 1960, and Johannesburg, South Africa in June 1961.\nAt present, the stations of the Deep Space Network\nare as follows:\n\nDesignation\t\n\nLocation\n\nPioneer\t\nGoldstone, California\nEcho\t\nGoldstone, California\nMars\t\nGoldstone, California\nWoomera\t\nIsland Lagoon, Australia\nTidbinbffla\t\nCanberra, Australia\r\nJohannesburg Johannesburg, South Africa\nRobledo\t\nMadrid, Spain\nCebreros\t\nMadrid, Spain\nCape Kennedy\t\nCape Kennedy, Florida\nThese sites were chosen so that three prime stations\nwould be separated by about 120 degrees in longitude and would be located between 40\xc2\xb0N and 30\xc2\xb0S\nlatitude; this separation assures that at least one station would be in contact with spacecraft vehicles in\ndeep space, despite rotation of the earth. Each station\nis equipped with an 85-ft steerable-dish antenna\nexcept Mars, which has a 210-ft diameter antenna\ndesigned to receive radio signals from millions of\nmiles in space. The stations are located in natural\ndepressions or valleys to decrease interference from\nlocal radio stations and other electromagnetic sources.\n\nThe facilities of the Deep Space Network have\nbeen incorporated in the Manned Space Flight Network in support of the Apollo program. The most\nsignificant electronics system addition to the Deep\nSpace Network operational L-band system at 890960 MHz is the unified S-band (USB) transmit/\nreceive RF system (2290-2300 MHz); this single\nsystem replaces the multiple antennas and RF links\npreviously used for the Mercury and Gemini spacecrafts and allows simultaneous modulation of voice\nand telemetry data on the same RF carrier used for\nthe tracking function.\nA report describing the Deep Space Network support of the Manned Space Flight Network for Apollo\nhas been prepared. It describes the history of the\ndevelopment of the S-band radio system; the NASA\nreceiver/exciter/ranging subsystem employed in the\nUSB system was evolved in three stages from an\noriginal S-band system used early in the program for\nmodifying the Deep Space Network for use with the\nManned Space Flight Network. Synoptic details and\nblock diagrams are given of the system characteristics\nat each stage in the development of the S-band system. Summaries are given of station tests and evaluations which verified the compatibilities of the various\nsubsystems and the overall operational capability of\nthe system and the entire network; both static and\ndynamic tracking tests are described. Details are\ngiven of the qualification tests made during unmanned\nApollo 4, 5, and 6 flights in which all stations in the\nnetwork were involved.\n\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
