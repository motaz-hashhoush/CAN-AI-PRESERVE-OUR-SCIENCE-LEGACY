A recent internal NASA study of a High Altitude Venus\nOperational Concept (HAVOC) led to the development of an evolutionary program for the\nexploration of Venus, with focus on the mission architecture and vehicle concept for a 30-day\ncrewed mission into Venus\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere at 50 km. Key technical challenges for the mission\ninclude performing the aerocapture maneuvers at Venus and Earth, inserting and inflating\nthe airship at Venus during the entry sequence, and protecting the solar panels and structure\nfrom the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Two proofs of concept were identified that would\naid in addressing some of the key technical challenges. To mitigate the threat posed by the\nsulfuric acid ambient in the atmosphere of Venus, a material was needed that could protect\nthe systems while being lightweight and not inhibiting the performance of the solar panels.\nThe first proof of concept identified candidate materials and evaluated them, finding FEPteflon to maintain 90% transmittance to relevant spectra even after 30 days of immersion in\nconcentrated sulfuric acid. The second proof of concept developed and verified a packaging\nalgorithm for the airship envelope to inform the entry, descent, and inflation analysis.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nH\n\nUMAN observation of and interest in Venus reaches back into ancient history. The early astronomers of China,\nBabylon, Greece, and India saw Venus as a bright, early morning star that appeared shortly before sunrise and\ndisappeared quickly after sunset. Later, Venus played a pivotal role in the Enlightenment, as astronomers of that era\nused the phases of Venus, caused by the planet\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to the Sun and brief periods of visibility, as evidence to\ndisprove geocentric theories. Now, Venus serves as a place to test new technologies, explore extreme planetary\nchemistries, and understand and develop climate models of other worlds. Recent explorations during the late 20th\nCentury pursued primarily by the Soviet Union found Venus to be a hellish wasteland. The surface pressure under the\n\n1\n\nAerospace Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462, AIAA Member.\nAerospace Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462, AIAA Member.\n3\nStudent Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462, AIAA Student Member.\n4\nStudent Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462, AIAA Student Member.\n5\nStudent Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462.\n6\nStudent Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, MS 462, AIAA Student Member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nmassive atmosphere is 92 times that of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s, with surface temperatures upward of 735 Kelvin (K), well beyond\nwhat is necessary to melt most electronics and metals, with a weather system based on the movement of sulfuric acid.\nModes of robotic exploration of Venus have varied to deal with the intense environments of the Venusian\natmosphere. During the Cold War of the mid-twentieth century, the United States of America tended to focus on\nMartian exploration, while the Russians focused on Venus. The Venera missions pursued exploration of Venus\nthrough orbiter missions, small scale balloons, drop probes and landers. The lander vehicle of Venera 13 was by far\nthe longest lived surface explorer, surviving on the surface for 157 minutes before succumbing to heat and pressure.\nBoth superpowers of the Cold War even planned manned Venus flybys using their technologies slightly re-adapted\nfrom the Moon Race. More recently, explorations have been spearheaded by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA), though mainly confined to fly-bys, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),\nfocusing on an orbiter mission, and the European Space Agency (ESA). Besides the numerous probes sent to orbit the\nplanet, there has been less than a week of total surface and atmospheric exploration of the whole planet. Exploration\nabove 50 kilometers, below which the haze layer starts to increase the acid content and reduce the amount of light\navailable for photovoltaics, is appealing to both mission designers and planetary scientists. Geoffrey A. Landis of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center [1] and the Venus Exploration Analysis Group (VEXAG) [2] both call for\nexploration, habitation and potential colonization of Venus above the haze layer, where breathable air (20% oxygen,\n70% nitrogen) is a lifting gas and the atmosphere is Earth-like in quality.\nVenus\xe2\x80\x99 climatological and geographical features are very intriguing to planetary scientists and others. The runaway\ngreenhouse effect within the atmosphere of Venus could lend some insight into the future of our own planet, and the\nvaried geography and acid based meteorology gives us insight into Venus\xe2\x80\x99s history. Additionally, in terms of human\nexploration, efficient transfer to Venus is easier than that to Mars, with mission opportunity windows being open every\nyear and a half for Venus rather than every two years to Mars. Also, an exploration of potential round trip trajectories\nfor Venus have been found to be as short as 14 months, compared to 26 months or more for Mars.\nThe High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) [3] focuses on the development of five potential phases\nof Venusian exploration and eventual habitation. Phase I focuses on robotic exploration, Phases II, III and IV focus\non human study and exploration from orbit and then by airship, leading eventually to Phase V which focuses on longterm atmospheric habitation and colonization (See Figure 1). To develop the mechanisms of Phase III of this\nexploration, which involves a 30-day manned mission to the Venusian atmosphere, and improve its Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL), this project pursued two goals: 1) to construct a model that can demonstrate an Entry, Descent\nand Inflation (EDI) concept for an airship into the Venusian atmosphere and 2) to test different transparent films that\ncan be used as solar cell protection against the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s harsh conditions.\n\nFigure 1: Evolutionary Venus Exploration Strategy\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nII. Model Airship Demonstration\nOne of the challenges that comes with sending an airship to Venus is the process of visualizing the EDI and\ndeployment of the entire vehicle into the atmosphere. Fully deployed, the airship is about the length of a Saturn V\nrocket, and three times as wide. For transfer using near-term technologies, that system must fit within a launch shroud\nof a similar size to the Saturn V\xe2\x80\x99s second stage [3]. By fabricating a physical model to demonstrate its EDI, the\nfeasibility of the overall HAVOC Phase III mission can be better understood (see Figure 2). Thus, the team chose to\nbuild a model of the airship that included scale proxies of all the necessary components of the airship for a 30-day\nmission to the 50 km altitude in Venus\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, including the habitable gondola, the ascent vehicle (AV) and\nthe inflatable structure. Ultimately, the model was designed to demonstrate the folding and packaging of all these\ncomponents of the airship into a heat-shielding aeroshell, the EDI sequence the airship undergoes as it descends to 50\nkm and finally, the operation of the various electronic components on the gondola and ascent vehicle.\n\nFigure 2: Vehicle concept for HAVOC Phase III mission.\n\nBefore building the physical model, the team began the proof of concept by developing an EDI sequence for the\nairship Certain constraints restricted design choices, such as g-force loading, complexity of unfolding design and the\npositioning of the inflatable structure. The Kepner-Tregoe Decision Making Process [4] was largely used to help the\nteam organize different ideas for the folding, unfolding and inflation of the airship, as well as the process of releasing\nthe various components of the aeroshell as the airship descended.\nA key element of this study focused on the design, modeling, simulation, and analysis of two segments of the\nHAVOC trajectories: aerocapture and EDI [3,5]. During aerocapture the vehicle takes advantage of the drag created\nby flying through the atmosphere to reduce the speed of the vehicle, without the use of a large propulsive maneuver.\nBank angle modulation is used to adjust the lift vector and guide the vehicle toward the desired target apoapsis, using\na small propulsive burn to clean up any targeting errors. Once the vehicle is in the desired circular orbit, atmospheric\nentry may begin. During Entry, the entry vehicle (EV) is guided through the middle and lower atmosphere and may\nbe maneuvered to prevent excessive heating and aerodynamic loads. Once the EV has slowed to supersonic velocities,\nthe Descent phase begins when an aerodynamic decelerator, such as a parachute or ballute, is deployed to further\nreduce descent rate. The Inflation phase begins when the EV velocity is sufficiently reduced such that the airship may\nbe exposed to the oncoming flow. The airship is pressurized during parachute descent and reaches a nominal altitude\nof approximately 50 km.\nOnce the EDI sequence was developed (see Figure 3: HAVOC aerocapture, entry, descent, and inflation concept\nof operations. Notable events, with altitude, velocity, and time data, are given.Figure 3), the necessary materials to\nbuild a first physical scale-model were gathered to see if all the required components of the airship could fit into the\naeroshell. An initial, simple physical model was constructed using nylon and cardboard measured to scaled\ndimensions, and showed that those elements would fit into a scaled-aeroshell. Afterward, the team began designing\nthe final model of the airship using a variety of methods, including 3D-modelling, sewing, electronic system design\nand pneumatic system design. The most important requirements considered when designing the final model were 1)\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nto keep everything to-scale to show that everything would, in fact, fit inside the aeroshell feasibly; and 2) to design\naccording to the EDI sequence.\nCertain parts of the airship needed to have solid structure, such as the aeroshell, gondola, ascent vehicle, helium\ntanks, fins,and nose cones, and thus were designed using 3D-modelling, then 3D-printed using ABS plastic. Other\nparts, such as the inflatable structure, needed to be flexible and easy to fold around the hard components of the airship.\nTo show the movement of the ascent vehicle and the deployment of the inflatable structure, electronics and pneumatic\nsystems were designed and integrated into the model. These systems were designed using commercial off-the-shelf\ncomponents, including an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a gas bag derived from an advertising blimp, and pneumatic\ntubing. Components like the airship envelope, which was sewn together based off of plans developed by the team and\nthe onboard breakout shield for the gondola\xe2\x80\x99s electronics, were custom made.\n\nFigure 3: HAVOC aerocapture, entry, descent, and inflation concept of operations. Notable events, with altitude, velocity,\nand time data, are given.\n\nThe final airship proof of concept model was developed at a 1/53rd scale (0.75 inches/meter, although the\nthicknesses of the envelope and payloads was not correspondingly modified due to material limitations. The folding\nalgorithm used to package the airship envelop is shown in Figure 4 through Figure 8. This folding algorithm has\nheritage in the folding techniques of the parachutes deployed from model rockets[6],allowing it to unfold rapidly\nwithout binding. Compression straps were used to further tighten and compress the balloon payload so all components\ncould fit within the entry aeroshell.\n\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 4: First step of folding airship envelope for packaging demonstration. The airship envelope is flattened and, and the\nlateral sides are folded into the middle.\n\nFigure 5: Second step of folding airship envelope for packaging demonstration. Each side is \xe2\x80\x9cZ-folded\xe2\x80\x9d into the middle,\nwith the folds occurring between the rows of solar panels. The fins are made to overlap.\n\nFigure 6: Third step of folding airship envelope for packaging demonstration. Velcro straps are used to cinch the four outer\nsegments of the airship envelope (at approximately the locations of the dimensions on the figure above), while the middle\nsegment is left unbound. The front end is then Z-folded so that it lays over the middle segment.\n\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 7: Fourth step of folding airship envelope for packaging demonstration. The back end is Z-folded over the middle\nsegment, as previously done with the front end.\n\nFigure 8: Fifth step of folding airship envelope for packaging demonstration. The folded bundle is attached to the gondola,\nthen another Velcro strap is used to cinch the middle segment to expel any remaining air in the envelope.\n\nFrom this starting configuration within the aeroshell, the top is removed, and then the sides fall away, exposing a\nmajority of the folded gas envelope. Then, the folds are undone by tugging on the front simulated TPS sled and the\nback deceleration plate (where the supersonic decelerator would be attached). This action brings the airship to its total\nlength and the compression straps are removed. The airship is inflated using an external pump and hose connected to\nthe gas bag. Inflation typically happens within a minute. The inflated airship with gondola is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9: Inflated airship model with gondola containing habitat and ascent vehicle.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBecause the scaled airship fits within the scaled aeroshell (despite the disproportionately scaled thickness of the\ngasbag and gondola elements), this model indicates that the Phase III airship can be packaged within the 10 meter by\n30 meter aeroshell of an SLS Block 2B vehicle.\n\nIII. Sulfuric Acid Resistant Material Testing\nThe airship will be powered by solar cells that lay along the top surface of the inflatable structure. While the\natmosphere at the operating altitude of 50 km is favorable for human exploration relative to the surface of Venus,\nthere are droplets of highly concentrated sulfuric acid floating in the local atmosphere. This sulfuric acid could\npotentially degrade the surface of the solar cells, which would inhibit energy production for the airship. It is important\nto find some transparent coating that can protect the surface of the solar cells against the sulfuric acid during the 30day operation in the atmosphere, while still permitting the useful wavelengths for the solar cells to pass through. Thus,\nthe team designed an experiment to test the physical integrity and optical clarity of several films after being submerged\nin a sulfuric acid solution ranging in concentrations from 75% to 85% for a 30-day period.\nGiven these criteria, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEPTeflon) were identified as candidate materials for testing. From a review of chemical resistances [7],the team expected\nthat FEP would likely not be affected by sulfuric acid, PP would be affected minutely, although it should be noted that\nits performance was only rated up to 49 \xc2\xb0C, and PVC would be affected minutely as well, despite having performance\nrated up to 22 \xc2\xb0C (all data based on 98% sulfuric acid solution).These three different materials were soaked in both\n75% and 85% concentrated sulfuric acid for 1, 7, and 30 days to ensure that the materials were resistant in the range\nof sulfuric acid that is found on Venus at the 50 km altitude and can last for the expected length of the mission. This\nresulted in the team preparing 18 samples.\nTo measure the impact of sulfuric acid immersion on these materials, the team prepared test samples in the shape\nshown in Figure 10. The team cut the samples into rectangular strips, which were then folded over and sealed with a\nheat sealer (the hashed areas in the figure). The middle area was thus an enclosed pocket that would ensure that only\none side of the material was exposed to acid. The open area at the top of the sample allowed for a dowel to be inserted\nso that the sample could be suspended in a beaker of acid. After the team removed the sample from the acid, the\nsample was rinsed and dried. The team cut a 1 inch by 1 inch square section from the middle area, which was then\ntested for physical and optical properties.\nThe team used Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-VISNIR) spectroscopy to assess the spectral properties of the samples after acid immersion, as well as control samples\nthat were not exposed to acid. The FT-IR machine collected spectral data that was used to determine if there were any\nchemical changes in the material over time. The UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer measured the amount of transmittance for\na material from the ultraviolet to infrared spectrum (100-1000 nm). The team used this data to evaluate the degradation\nin transmittance after exposure to sulfuric acid. The team used a scale, micrometer, and a ruler to measure weight and\nlinear dimensions of the samples to see if there were any changes in physical properties of the samples.\nTable 1 shows the results of the UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy for each of the six samples (FEP, PP, and PVC at 75%\nand 85% concentrations) after 0, 1, 7, and 30 days. The value is the averaged transmittance over the 300 nm to 1000\nnm wavelengths; this is used as a metric for the capacity of the material to transmit visible light to the solar panels.\nThe FEP and PP samples saw negligible decay (within the 2% accuracy of the spectroscopy) in transmittance over 30\ndays. The PVC sample in 75% concentration began to turn brown an hour after immersion, and saw a sharp decline\nin transmittance after a single day, with small further declines measured in the 7-day and 30-day samples. When\nextracted and cleaned after immersion, the PVC sample in 85% concentration produced a persistent \xe2\x80\x9csweat\xe2\x80\x9d even after\nbeing baked in a 70 \xc2\xb0C vacuum oven for over four hours, and the team found sulfuric acid inside the middle pocket of\nthe sample. when they were cut open in preparation for spectral analysis, some sulfuric acid was found inside. At\nfirst, the team suspected that the 1-day sample might have been fabricated with a leak, but the 7-day sample also\ncontained internal acid, and appeared to have corroded the neighboring sample slightly while they were drying in the\noven. Because the intent of the test was to keep the pockets sealed and only expose the outer surface to acid, and\nbecause the residual acid might damage the testing equipment, the 85% PVC samples were discarded and not measured\nin either spectroscope. Figure 11 through Figure 15 show the transmittance versus wavelength for each material and\nconcentration, across the 0-day, 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day samples.\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 10: Test sample dimensions. The hashed areas were sealed using a heat press.\nTable 1: Average Transmittance over 300 nm to 1000 nm.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 11: Transmittance as a function of wavelength for polypropylene in 75% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\n\nFigure 12: Transmittance as a function of wavelength for polypropylene in 85% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 13: Transmittance as a function of wavelength for FEP-teflon in 75% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\n\nFigure 14: Transmittance as a function of wavelength for FEP-teflon in 85% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\n\nFrom analysis of the FT-IR data, only PVC underwent a chemical change. Figure 16 shows the transmittance\nversus wavenumber for the PVC sample in 75% concentration at each time step. The spike occurring at 3000-3500\ncm-1 indicates that the reaction that took place could have created a low concentration carboxylic acid, based on a\nreview of group absorption frequencies in infrared spectroscopy [8]. An indicator of carboxylic acids is that they have\nstrong odors that have volatile derivatives; some examples are acetic acid (vinegar) and butyric acid (human vomit)\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n[9]. When the PVC sample was pulled out of the sulfuric acid, a distinct odor came from the material that is comparable\nto acetic acid and butyric acid, It should be noted that this is an untested hypothesis based off of the data that was\ncollected in this experiment\n\nFigure 15: Transmittance as a function of wavelength for polyvinyl chloride in 75% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\n\nFigure 16: Transmittance vs wavenumber for polyvinyl chloride in 75% concentration sulfuric acid solution.\nThe shift in the curves over time (from blue, through red and black, to green) indicates a chemical composition\nchange.\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nIV. Conclusion\nThe HAVOC study has developed an evolutionary exploration plan for Venus that can meet scientific objectives\nfor planetary science while offering another destination for human exploration beyond Earth. Two proof of concept\ndemonstrations have indicated feasibility for the proposed airship concept. The team showed that a scale model of an\nairship can be packaged within a scale model of an aeroshell. The team also found the FEP-teflon shows promise as a\nmaterial for protecting solar panels and other elements of the airship from the ambient sulfuric acid. Future analysis\nwould include understanding how to attach the FEP-teflon to the solar panels, and testing the integrated performance\nin an accurate environment. Ultimately, the authors conclude that Venus, with its relatively hospitable upper\natmosphere, can play a role in humanity\xe2\x80\x99s future in space.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate at NASA Langley Research Center\nfor funding this study.
