In extreme weather events, such as powerful storms and intense droughts, the primary role of the ABL is to supply or deny moisture to the weather system. Even for routine weather regimes, cloudiness and precipitation are key elements of any forecast. The premier problem for ABL parameterization is to formulate the physical coupling between the ABL turbulence and the clouds.", "title": "Interaction of the ABL with stratocumulus and cumulus cloud layers, appendix N", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840020240, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Randall, D.
