Programs and Projects for 2015\nHung D. Nguyen and Gynelle C. Steele\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nAbstract\nThis report is intended to help NASA program and project managers incorporate Small Business\nInnovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR)/(STTR) technologies into NASA\nAeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) projects. Other Government and commercial projects\nmanagers can also find this useful.\n\nIntroduction\nIncorporating Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)-developed technology into NASA projects\nis important, especially given the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s limited resources for technology development. The program\xe2\x80\x99s\noriginal intention was for technologies that had completed Phase II to be ready for integration into NASA\nprograms, however, in many cases there is a gap between Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 5 and 6\nthat needs to be closed.\nAfter SBIR Phase II projects are completed, the technology is evaluated against various parameters\nand a TRL rating is assigned. Most programs tend to adopt more mature technologies\xe2\x80\x94at least TRL 6 to\nreduce the risk to the mission rather than adopt TRLs between 3 and 5 because those technologies are\nperceived as too risky. The gap between TRLs 5 and 6 is often called the \xe2\x80\x9cValley of Death,\xe2\x80\x9d (Figure 1)\nand historically it has been difficult to close because of a lack of funding support from programs. Several\npapers have already suggested remedies on how to close the gap (Refs. 1 to 4).\n\nSBIR Solicitation Process\nUnderstanding how the SBIR solicitation process works should help small businesses and\nAeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) project managers form partnerships to incorporate\nSBIR technologies into NASA programs and projects. For example, when ARMD program managers\nidentify specific SBIR subtopics that are likely to generate technologies that could apply to their programs\nor projects, the SBIR office would provide information about previously developed technologies that\ncould be incorporated into their work. Small business principal investigators (PIs) would also benefit\nfrom understanding NASA program and project needs, thus increasing the likelihood that the technologies\nthey developed will be infused into ARMD projects. The fiscal year (FY) 2015 and 2014 solicitations are\nposted at http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/solicitations.\nIntegrating SBIR-developed technology into NASA programs and projects is important, especially\ngiven the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s limited resources for technology development. The SBIR program\xe2\x80\x99s original intent\nwas for technologies that had completed Phase II to be ready for integration into NASA programs. Now\nthe SBIR program supports its small business partners with three post-Phase II options that focus on\ncreating opportunities for commercialization as well as technology integration. The Phase II Enhancement\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).\n\n(Phase II\xe2\x80\x93E), Phase II Expanded (Phase II\xe2\x80\x93X), and Commercialization Readiness Program (CRP) options\nalso provide opportunities for Phase II technologies to be integrated and tested in the NASA system\nplatform or in the space environment.\nThe three post-Phase II options, which typically last between 6 and 36 months, create more\nopportunities to advance technology maturity, reduce associated risks, and increase the likelihood for\nintegrating technology into NASA, Department of Defense (DoD), or external entity programs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPhase II\xe2\x80\x93E: This option advances Phase II innovations by extending existing Phase II contracts.\nUnder Phase II\xe2\x80\x93E extensions, NASA SBIR will match, investments in technology development that\nsmall businesses secure from eligible non-NASA SBIR third parties on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The\nminimum matching investment is $25,000 and the maximum is $150,000, extending projects by 6 to\n12 months.\nPhase II\xe2\x80\x93X: This option establishes a strong and direct partnership between the SBIR program and\nNASA programs and projects undertaking new technology development. Under Phase II\xe2\x80\x93X\nexpansions, NASA SBIR will double the funding that small businesses secure from non-SBIR NASA\nprograms or projects. The minimum investment that NASA SBIR will double is $75,000 and the\nmaximum is $250,000. Expanded projects last between 12 and 24 months.\nCRP: This option accelerates transition of SBIR-developed technologies into NASA applications.\nProjects that request SBIR funding under the CRP option must (1) involve a technology that entered\ninto either a Phase I or Phase II contract and (2) identify how more SBIR funding would accelerate\ndevelopment in response to NASA program or project needs. The minimum matching investment is\n$100,000 and the maximum is $1.5 million, extending projects by 24 to 36 months.\nTable I summarizes the three post-Phase II options.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n2\n\nTABLE I.\xe2\x80\x94NASA SBIR POST-PHASE II FUNDING OPTIONS\nPhase II\xe2\x80\x93E\nPhase II\xe2\x80\x93Xa\n\nCriteria\n\nCRP\n\nPurpose\n\nAdvance SBIR technology\nby extending current Phase\nII contracts\n\nEstablish partnerships\nbetween NASA programs\nand projects and non-SBIR\ncompanies\n\nAccelerate transition of\nSBIR-developed\ntechnologies into NASA\napplications\n\nFunding source\n\nAny eligible non-NASA\nSBIR third party\n\nNASA program or project\n\nEither eligible NASA\nprogram or project or nonNASA SBIR third party\n\nMinimum, dollars\n\n$25,000\n\n$75,000\n\nMaximum, dollars\n\n$150,000\n\n$250,000\n\nSBIR match\n\n$0\n\n1:1\n\nPerformance period, months\naBeginning\n\n$0\n\n2:1\n\nUp to $1,500,000\n\n6 to 12\n\n12 to 24\n\n24 to 36\n\nin FY 2012.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate topics and\nsubtopics for FY 2015 Phase I.\n\nFiscal Year 2015 Phase I SBIR Topic and Subtopic Summaries\nTopics and subtopics for all directorates are listed in Chapter 9 of the FY15 Phase I SBIR solicitation.\nARMD topics and subtopics are shown in Figure 2 and ARMD solicitation descriptions follow.\n\nTopic A1 Air Vehicle Technology\nA1.01 Structural Efficiency-Hybrid Nanocomposites\nTwo of the primary goals of the Advanced Air Vehicles program are safety and efficiency, which can\nbe achieved simultaneously through designer materials tailored for future aircraft structures. The SOA for\nlightweight structures are carbon fiber reinforced polymeric composites which make up approximately\n50% of the weight of Boeing's 787. Adoption of all-carbon nanotube (CNT) composites to exploit their\npotential for enhancing structural efficiency is viewed as too far term, given the current state of CNT\ntechnology maturation. Hybrid composites enable improved mechanical properties such as interlaminar\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n3\n\nstrength, while simultaneously increasing electrical and thermal conductivity to enable features such as\nlightning strike protection, embedded sensing, etc.\nA1.02 Aerodynamic Efficiency Drag Reduction Technology\nThe challenge of energy-efficient flight has at its foundation aerodynamic efficiency, and at the\nfoundation of aerodynamic efficiency is low drag. Drag can be broadly decomposed into four\ncomponents: viscous or skin friction drag, lift-induced drag, wave or compressibility drag, and\nexcrescence drag due to various protruding items such as antennae, wipers, lights, etc. The relative impact\nof these four forces depends upon the targeted flight regime and vehicle-specific design requirements.\nThe first force, however, viscous skin friction, stands out as particularly significant across most classes of\nflight vehicles and effective measures for its control would have a major impact of flight efficiency. In\nparticular, supersonic, low-boom flight and new generations of energy-efficient subsonic transport\nairplanes including high L/D strut-braced designs, the blended wing body (BWB), so called \xe2\x80\x9cdoublebubble\xe2\x80\x9d designs and other concepts with large expanses of surface area would benefit from effective\nviscous drag control.\nA1.03 Low Emissions Propulsion and Power\nSupports electric propulsion of transport aircraft, including turboelectric propulsion (turbine prime\nmover with electric distribution of power to propulsors) and various hybrid electric concepts, such as gas\nturbine engine and battery combinations. Turboelectric propulsion for transport aircraft applications will\nrequire components with high specific power (hp/lb or kW/kg) and high efficiency, and cryogenic and\nsuperconducting components will likely be required. The cryogenic components of interest include fully\nsuperconducting generators and motors (i.e., superconducting stators as well as rotors), cryogenic\ninverters and active rectifiers, and cryocoolers.\nA1.04 Quiet Performance\nImprovements in noise prediction, acoustic and relevant flow field measurement methods, noise\npropagation and noise control are needed for subsonic, transonic and supersonic vehicles targeted\nspecifically at airframe noise sources and the noise sources due to the aerodynamic and acoustic\ninteraction of airframe and engines. Innovative source identification techniques for airframe (e.g., landing\ngear, high lift systems) noise sources, including turbulence details related to flow-induced noise typical of\nseparated flow regions, vortices, shear layers, etc.\nA1.05 Physics-Based Conceptual Aeronautics Design Tools\nInvestigates the potential of advanced, innovative propulsion and aircraft concepts to improve fuel\nefficiency and reduce the environmental footprint of future generations of commercial transports across\nthe breadth of the flight speed regimes. Propulsion systems such as open rotors and hybrid-electric\npropulsion, are viewed as potential options for helping meet aggressive, long range (i.e., 'N+3' timeframe)\nemission reduction targets. Accurate representation of the propulsion system is critical in confidently\nassessing the potential of a concept. Conceptual design and analysis of unconventional propulsion\nconcepts and technologies is used for technology portfolio investment planning, development of advanced\nconcepts to provide technology pull and independent technical assessment of new concepts.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n4\n\nA1.06 Vertical Lift\nThe use of small vertical lift UAVs has increased in recent times with many civilian missions being\nproposed, including autonomous surveillance, mapping, etc. Much of the current research associated with\nthese vehicles has been in the areas of electric propulsion, batteries, small sensors and autonomous\ncontrol laws, while very little attention has been paid to their acoustic signature. The generation and\npropagation of noise associated with this small class of vertical lift UAVs are not well understood and\nvalidated prediction tools do not currently exist. The objective of a proposed effort would be to develop\ntools for the modeling and prediction of the high frequency acoustics for small vertical lift UAVs, such as\nquad-copters, coaxials, ducted fan rotors, etc.\nA1.07 Efficient Propulsion and Power\nFocuses on propulsion controls and dynamics. Typical current operating engine control logic is\ndesigned using SISO (Single Input Single Output) PI (Proportional+Integral) control. The control logic is\ndesigned to provide minimum guaranteed performance while maintaining adequate safety margins\nthroughout the engine operating life. Additionally, the control logic indirectly provides control of\nvariables of interest such as Thrust, Stall Margin, etc. since these variables cannot be measured or are not\nmeasured in flight because of restrictions on sensor cost/placement/reliability, etc. to develop all aspects\nof control systems to enable safe operation of low emissions combustors throughout the engine operating\nenvelope. Low emission combustors are prone to thermo-acoustic instabilities. So far NASA research in\nthis area has focused on modulating the main or pilot fuel flow to suppress such instability. Advanced,\nultra-low emissions combustors utilize multi-point (multi-location) injection to achieve a homogeneous,\nlean fuel/air mixture.\nA1.08 Ground Testing and Measurement Technologies\nDevelops innovative tools and technologies that enhance testing and measurement capabilities,\nimprove ground test resource utilization and efficiency, and provide capability sustainment. Where\npossible, the tools and technologies should be applicable for the broad national scope of government,\ncommercial, and university capabilities.\n\nTopic A2 Integrated Flight Systems\nA2.01 Flight Test and Measurements Technologies\nNASA continues to see flight research as a critical element in the maturation of technology. This\nincludes developing test techniques that improve the control of in-flight test conditions, expanding\nmeasurement and analysis methodologies, and improving test data acquisition and management with\nsensors and systems that have fast response, low volume, minimal intrusion, and high accuracy and\nreliability. By using state-of-the-art flight test techniques along with novel measurement and data\nacquisition technologies, NASA and the aerospace industry will be able to conduct flight research more\neffectively and also meet the challenges presented by NASA and industry\xe2\x80\x99s cutting edge research and\ndevelopment programs\nA2.02 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer advantages over manned aircraft for applications which are\ndangerous to humans, long in duration, require great precision, and require quick reaction. Examples of\nsuch applications include remote sensing, disaster response, delivery of goods, agricultural support, and\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n5\n\nmany other known and yet to be discovered. In addition, the future of UAS promises great economic and\noperational advantages by requiring less human participation, less human training, an ability to take-off\nand land at any location, and the ability to react to dynamic situations.\n\nTopic A3 Integrated Flight Systems\nA3.01 Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts\nThis subtopic addresses user needs and performance capabilities, trajectory-based operations, and the\noptimal assignment of humans and automation to air transportation system functions, gate-to-gate\nconcepts and technologies to increase capacity and throughput of the National Airspace System (NAS),\nand achieving high efficiency in using aircraft, airports, en route and terminal airspace resources, while\naccommodating an increasing variety of missions and vehicle types, including full integration of\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations.\nA3.02 Autonomy of the National Airspace System\nDevelop concepts or technologies focused on increasing the efficiency of the air transportation system\nwithin the mid-term operational paradigm (2025 to 2035 time frame), in areas that would culminate in\nautonomy products to improve mobility, scalability, efficiency, safety, and cost-competitiveness.\nA3.03 Future Aviation Systems Safety\nThe Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) will be concluding the successful Aviation\nSafety Program (AvSP). The newly expanded Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) will be\nsucceeding AvSP\xe2\x80\x99s significant achievements and stepping up to lead the ARMD research in the area of\nReal-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance (RSSA). ARMD\xe2\x80\x99s Real-Time System-Wide Safety Assurance\nRSSA will be focused towards a future National Airspace System where a gate-to-gate trajectory-based\nsystem capability exists that satisfies a full vision for NextGen and beyond. The ultimate vision for RSSA\nwould enable the delivery of a progression of capabilities that accelerate the detection, prognosis and\nresolution of system-wide threats\n\nFiscal Year 2014 Phase II SBIR Topic and Subtopic Summaries\nTopics and subtopics for all directorates are listed in Chapter 9 of the FY14 Phase II SBIR\nsolicitation. ARMD topics and subtopics are shown in Figure 3 and ARMD solicitation descriptions\nfollow.\n\nTopic A1 Aviation Safety\nA1.01 Aviation External Hazard Sensor Technologies\nExplores new and improved sensors and sensor systems for the detection and monitoring of hazards\nto aircraft before they are encountered. Approaches that use multiple sensors in combination to improve\nhazard detection and quantification of hazard levels are also of interest. With regard to hazardous\nlightning conditions, the emphasis is not on remote detection, but rather on developing systems that make\naircraft more robust in a lightning environment or provide in-flight damage assessment or other hazard\nmitigating benefits. The scope of this subtopic does not include human factors and focused development\nof human interfaces, including displays and alerts. Primary emphasis is on airborne applications, but in\nsome cases the development of ground-based sensor technology may be supported.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n6\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate topics and subtopics for FY 2014 Phase II.\n\nA1.02 Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology\nPrevents hazardous in-flight conditions by addressing detection, measurement, and/or the mitigation\nof the hazards of flight into super-cooled liquid water clouds and flight into regions of high mass\nconcentrations of ice crystal. Measurement and detection can include measurement of the phase (ice or\nliquid), measurement of the mass of the droplets, or 3-D measurements of ice density.\nA1.03 Real-Time Safety Assurance Under Unanticipated and Hazardous Conditions\nAssuring safety of flight under uncertain, unanticipated, and multiple hazards is a core requirement\nfor aircraft loss of control prevention and for safety-assured autonomous aircraft operations. Sources of\nhazards include adverse onboard conditions (e.g., system failures, vehicle impairment or damage),\nexternal disturbances (e.g., turbulence, inclement weather, wake vortices), and abnormal flight conditions\n(e.g., abnormal attitudes/rates, unsafe/abnormal flight trajectories, stall/departure).\nA1.04 Prognostics and Decision Making\nTopics address aspects of the following areas (1) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction techniques\nthat address a set of fault modes for a device or component, for example by modeling the physics of the\nmost critical fault modes and using (typically less accurate) data-driven methods for the remainder, and\n(2) Physics-based damage propagation models for one or more relevant aircraft subsystems such as\nairframe structures, avionics, electrical power systems, and electronics. Methods for damage propagation\nin composite structures are of a particular interest. Proposals that focus on technologies envisioned for\nnext generation aircraft are strongly encouraged.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n7\n\nA1.05 Identification of Sequences of Atypical Occurrences in Massive Heterogeneous Datasets\nRepresenting the Operation of a System of Systems\nThe focus of this effort will be from the aircraft-level to fleet level and above. As such, the successful\nproposal will develop validated predictive analytics to uncover systemic human-automation interaction\nissues that manifest at a much broader level than those incidents that occur within a single flight or for a\nsingle aircraft. Real data from a defunct airline will be made available as GFE (government furnished\nequipment), representing the interactions between humans and automation found on flight systems, data\nfrom aircraft as well as supporting ground-based systems.\n\nTopic A2 Unmanned Aircraft Systems\nA2.01 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration in the National Airspace System Research\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are needed to fly in the National Airspace System (NAS) to\nperform missions for the National Security and Defense, Emergency Management, Science, and\ncommercial applications. Technology needs to be developed in order to reduce technical barriers for\nintegrating UAS into the NAS. Currently, five subprojects for this category include: separation\nassurance/sense and avoid interoperability, communications, human systems integration, certification, and\nintegrated test and evaluation.\n\nTopic A3 Air Vehicle Technology\nA3.01 Structural Efficiency\xe2\x80\x93Aeroservoelasticity\nThe technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a\nflight vehicle for ensuring freedom from catastrophic aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic instabilities. This\ndiscipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex interactions between a flexible structure and\nthe unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the structure and at times, active systems controlling the flight\nvehicle. The Fundamental Aeronautics Program's work on Structural Efficiency for the FY 2014 NASA\nSBIR solicitation is focused on aeroservoelasticity active structural control for lightweight flexible\nstructures.\nA3.02 Quiet Performance\nImprove noise prediction, acoustic and relevant flow field measurement methods, noise propagation,\nand noise control for subsonic, transonic, and supersonic vehicles, specifically targeting airframe noise\nsources and the noise sources due to the aerodynamic and acoustic interaction of the airframe and\nengines.\nA3.03 Low Emissions/Clean Power\nAchieves lower emissions and discover new paths to cleaner power for future air vehicles, which will\nbe required to operate under more stringent regulations for gaseous and particulate emissions. The\nfoundation for more efficient vehicles will be based on low emissions combustion processes which\nrequire very rapid mixing of the fuel and air with minimum pressure loss to achieve complete combustion\nin the smallest volume.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942016-218906\n\n8\n\nA3.04 Aerodynamic Efficiency\nNASA is conducting fundamental aeronautics research to develop innovative ideas that can lead to\nnext generation aircraft design concepts with improved aerodynamic efficiency.
