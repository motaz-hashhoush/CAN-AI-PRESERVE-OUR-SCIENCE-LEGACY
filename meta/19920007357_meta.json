Unfortunately, most existing rule based forward chaining languages are not very suitable to simulate this aspect of human intelligence, because of their lack of support for approximate reasoning techniques needed for this task, and due to the lack of specific constructs to facilitate the coding of frequently reoccurring decision block to provide better support for the design and implementation of rule based decision support systems. A language called BIRBAL, which is defined on the top of CLIPS, for the specification of decision blocks, is introduced. Empirical experiments involving the comparison of the length of CLIPS program with the corresponding BIRBAL program for three different applications are surveyed. The results of these experiments suggest that for decision making intensive applications, a CLIPS program tends to be about three times longer than the corresponding BIRBAL program.", "title": "Decision blocks: A tool for automating decision making in CLIPS", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920007357, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Eick, Christoph F."}, "organization": {"name": "Houston Univ.", "location": "TX., United States"}}, "id": "95690c8733af4a2c9705a0b27bff4d98"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920007357, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mehta, Nikhil N."}, "organization": {"name": "General Electric Co.", "location": "Houston, TX., United States"}}, "id": "a492c95f09d94ab8b8b808ea208f1ebb"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920007357, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920007357, "id": "13c7d05f0b4740b38086b1f97dc150d4", "publicationName": "NASA.
