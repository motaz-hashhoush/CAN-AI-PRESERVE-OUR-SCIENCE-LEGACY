INTRODUCTION\nThis report, written for task order 46, job order 335, reports\non a study to determine the methods and practicability of developing calibration techniques for Side Looking Radar (SLR) and\nfulfills the requirements of action document 46-33S-CO8. It is\nproposed that calibration of an airborne SLR can be accomplished\nby the use of a model that relates the radar parameters to the\nphysical mapping situation. A discussion of a radar model\nshould include a description of the characteristics of (1) the\ntransmitter, (2) the antenna, (3) the target absorption and\nreradiation, (4) the receiver and map making or radar data\nprocessing, and (5) the calibration process.\n\n1-1\n\n2. TRANSMITTED PULSE\nIn order to achieve calibration, information on the transmitted\npulse peak power, pulse shape, pulse width, pulse compression,\nand range side lobe level must be obtained. Depending on the\ntype of processing used, perhaps spectral frequency information\non the transmitted pulse will be necessary or desired. At any\nrate, a very accurate model or discrete description of the\ntransmitted pulse must be obtained. This transmitted pulse\ninformation will be processed in the chain of information in\nsucceeding sections of this report.\n\n2-1\n\n3. ANTENNA PATTERNS\n3.1 ANTENNA AZIMUTHAL PATTERN\nIn any practical calibration scheme, the azimuthal pattern,\nwhether real or synthetic, must be considered. A simple approach to a model is to assume an expotential model that can\nbe used to represent the entire antenna pattern, such as the\nfollowing equation\n\ne -k l (O l - 0 1 ) , + G e -k 2 ( 0 2 - 0 1 /2)\nG (0) - G0\t\n1\n\n2\n\n-kn(On\n\n+ G2e403 - 01/2) 2 + G\n\n..\n\n2\n\nne\n\n- 01/2)\n\n(3-1)\nwhich creates a model as illustrated in figure 3-1. (The beamwidth constants are the k\'s, and the lobe gains are the G\'s.)\nA more practical approach is to use measured pattern data that\nare a function of both azimuth and elevation. How the data\nshould be processed will be discussed in a later section of\nthis report.\n3.2 ANTENNA PATTERN OF ELEVATION OR DEPRESSION ANGLES\nTo obtain equal power signals from identical reflectors in the\nground plane, an airborne radar must have a "shaped" antenna\npattern. The required pattern for obtaining the equal return\nsignals is generally referred to as a csc 2 cos 1/2 function of\n1/2\npattern can\nan elevation or depression angle. \'Phis csc 2 Cos\nbe obtained by reshaping a parabolic or a cylindrical reflector\nilluminated by a primary feed, usually a horn. The specific\ndescription of the required vertical antenna pattern depends\n\n3-1\n\n^\t\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\non the application of the radar; however, a selected example\nwill be used to illustrate the specification of such a pattern.\nIn general, the complete elevation pattern is specified in two\nparts by an expotential function and by a trigonometric function;\ni.e.,\n\ne2\n\nel\t\n\t\nG(e) - G 0 a-p(e\n\n80 )\t 2\n+ P csc 2 a Cos\n\n1 e 2\t\n\n1/2 8\t\n\n(3-2)\ne3\n\nTo illustrate a practical case, consider an airborne\nantenna 0.5 meter in height by 2 meters in length operating\nat an altitude of 50,000 feet. Also, consider the maximum\nmapping range to be 500,000 feet and the operating frequency\nto be 10 GHz. Calculations on the vertical antenna pattern\nare made as follows:\nStep 1 \xe2\x80\x94 Initial depression angle, e0\n-\n\ne 0\t\n\ntan-1 s000 - 5.8\xc2\xb0 - 0.101 rad\t\n000\n\n(3-3)\n\nStep \xe2\x80\x94 Half-power beamwidth, 0\n8 - 1.2a\t\n\n(3-4)\n\nwhere X is the radiated wavelength and a is\nthe vertical antenna aperture size:\n\n0.072 rad\n\n- 4.13\xc2\xb0\t\n\nftW\nADMGp"BNMYVAAM 3-3\n\n(3-5)\n\n7.\n\nr\n\nStep 3 \xe2\x80\x94 Determination of the beamwidth constant p for\nthe expotential portion of the pattern:\n\n81\ne0)2\nG(e)\t - e\n\n`\t\n\n8\t\n\n(3-6)\n\n2\n\nFrom equations (3-3) to (3-6), one can observe that\nmaximum gain occurs at the angle e 0\n\nand decreases\n\nexpotentially on either side of the angle 8 0 .\nAt an angle 110/21 from 8 0 , the one-way power\nlevel of the pattern is approximately 3 decibels\nbelow that of the angle 8 0 . By knowing these\nquantities, one can determine the value of p in\nequation (3-6) as follows:\n\n2\n_ el/ -e-P(60 - 81/2-80)\n\nG(8)\t\n\ne \t\nI O\n\n2\n2\n\n= 10 log a_ P(e1/2) - 3.0103 dB\n10 log G(8) e _ 8\t\n0\t\n1/2\n\nlog G(e)Ie0 -\n\n8 1/2\n\n0\n\n-p(e1/2)2 log e - 0.30103\t\n\n(3-7)\n\nor\n\np w\t0.30103\n(e\n\n1/2)log\n\ne\n\n0.30103\n(0/2)2(0.43429)\n0.30103\n(0.036) (0.43429)\n\n3.0103 x 10-1\n(1.29 x 10 - )(4.3429 x 10 )\t\n\n53S\t\n\n(3-8)\n\nStep 4 \xe2\x80\x94 Dutermination of junction angle, 82\nAt the junction angle, e 2 ,\n\nthe gain slopes are\n\nequal on a log curve; i.e.,\n\nIf\nG1(e) - e -p(e - A0," \t\n(3\xe2\x80\xa2g)\nand\nG2(e) - P csc 2 6 r:os\'1/2 8\t\n\n3-5\n\n(3-10)\n\n\t\n\nthen\nd[In G1(82))d\n_\n\nR [kn G2(82)]\n80) 2\nd\n\n^^\t\n\n=\n\ndS\n\n.\n[In , -P (82 -\n\n-2p(8 2 - 6 0 )\t\n\n(3-11)\n\nand\n\nU-\t\n6\n\nG2(82)] _ R[Znp + 2\n\nIn csc 82\n\n+ 1/2 In cos e]\n\n0 + c\ncs\n\n2(\n\n-csc 8 2 cot 82)\n\n2\n\n1\n1\n+ \'T cos62(-sin 82)\n\n-2 cot 8 2\n\n- am\xe2\x80\x94\t\nc\n\n(3-12)\n\n2\n\nor\n2\t\n\n0\t\n\n82\t\n\n-\t\n(8 2\n\n8 0\t\n\n2 cot 8 +\t\n2\t\n\n1\nc ot\n\ncot 8 2\t\n\n2p (88 )\t\n\n1\n\n+ p cot a 2\n\np\t\n\ncot 82\n\nO.I01) _ \xe2\x80\x94 3\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 Z14U Cot \'\'2\t\n\n(3-13)\n\nFrom a trial - and-error solution, 8 2 a 6 . 7 0\t0.117 rad.\n3-b\n\n\t\n\nStep 5 \xe2\x80\x94 Determination of the constant P for the\ncsc 2 a cos l/ 2 a function at e2\nG2(e)\nwhere G l (e)\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nP =\t\n\n-P(e2 - 80)2\ne\ncsc e 2 cos\t\n62\n\ne -535(0.117 - 0.101)2\n_\n\n-\n\n(8.58) 36.\ne -0.137 = 0.874\n--\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 = 0.019\t\n\n(3-14)\n\nStep 6 \xe2\x80\x94 Determination of G O\tthe maximum aperture gain\n\n4n p a A\nG 0\t = --- --\n\nwhere X\t\nA\t\n\n(3-15)\n\nis the wavelength,\nis the physical area of the antenna, and\n\nP a is the antenna aperture efficiency\n(65 percent assumed).\n\nG0\t _ 4Tr(0.65) (0.5 x 2)m2\n(0.03)2 m2\n= 9060 or 39.5 dB\t\n\n3-7\n\n(3-16)\n\n\t\n\nStep 7 \xe2\x80\x94 The total theoretical description of the vertical\npattern is then\n\n0.0084\nG(8) - 9060fe-535(e - 0.101)2\n0.117\n\n1\t\n+ 0.019 csc 2\n\n8 Cos 1/2 e16.70\t\n\n(3-17)\n\n70\xc2\xb0\nSome comments on the preceding vertical pattern description\nbased on both theoretical and measured patterns include the\nfollowing:\nA.\n\nThe expotential portion of the pattern is specified\nstarting at 0.48 degree, the -20-decibel power\nlevel of the one-way power pattern. This is an\narbitrary choice of gain level.\n\nB.\n\nThe 70-degree angle, the greatest depression angle,\nis also arbitrarily chosen. What the actual choice\nof the maximum depression angle is depends on the\nrequired range resolution as discussed in another\nsection; i.e., CT/2 sec 8. Beyond the maximum\nspecified depression angle, the power pattern\nshould decrease as rapidly as is practical.\n\nC.\n\nAny deviations of the actual power pattern from\nthe theoretical power distribution will result\nin an uneven ground illumination. Two-way\npropagation will result in further unequal return\nsignal levels from similar terrain. For accurate\ncalibration of an SLR, the actual antenna pattern\nmust be measured and the power levels versus\nangle stored for subsequent data processing.\n\n3-8\n\n4. GROUND RETURN\n4.1 MAPPING GEOMETRY\nThe geometrical situation of a mapping, airborne SLR is shown\nin figure 4-1. The reflecting area is a function of the radar\nparameters, the vector directions, and the target characteristics.\nThe scattering cross section per unit area is the projected\narea along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) determined by the\nradar pulse width, T , and the antenna azimuthal beamwidth,\n^ . The use of T and\t\n\ndefines an area illuminated for\n\na duration of CT/2, where c is the velocity of light and the\n2 in the denominator accounts for the two-way radar energy\ntransmission. The use of T and \t\n\ncan also be used to define\n\na "pulse packet."\n\n4.2 RADAR PULSE PACKET GEOMETRY\nThe geometrical situation of the terrair relative to the "radar\npulse packet" is shown in figure 4-2. By use of the radar\npulse packet and the antenna pattern beamwidth, a radar resolution cell in the ground plane can be described. The radar\npulse packet (RPP) is an area in the ground plane bounded by\nthe azimuthal dimension (R s 0) and the cross-track dimension\nCT\n(sec e) i.e.,\n\nRPP =\n\n(R S 0) ( CT ec 9)\t\n\n4-1\n\n(4-1)\n\n0\n0\n\nt+o\nao\nQ\na\na\nCd\n\nH\nCd\nb\nCd\ns-4\n\na\nx\n\n0\n0\n\nQ\n10\n\nN\n\nO\n\nO\n,O\n\n4\n\noc\n..4\nELI\n\n4-2\n\nt\n\nN\n\nv\n0\n\n0\n\nca\na^\nx\n\nu\n\na\n\nco\n\na^\nti\n\na\ncd\nIt\nce\na\n\nI\nN\ni\n\nI\nb0\n\nW\n\n.C:\n\n4-3\n\nwhere\nR s is the slant range to a ground area\n^ is the azimuth beamwidth in radians\nc is the velocity of light\nT is the radar pulse width, and\ne is the depression angle from the horizontal.\nThe effective ground area, A , which is " seen" by the radar is\nthe projection of the pulse packet perpendicular to the line-ofsight or,\n\nAe = (R ^) (C tan e)\ns\n\nAlthough the effective ground area within a resolution cell\ncan be described by equation (4-2), the electromagnetic\ncharacteristics of the material within the cell will determine the quantity of incident energy reradiated in the\ndirection of the radar. That is, the resolution cell can\nbe considered to contain individual radiators (such as\ndipoles) that can be used to describe the electromagnetic\ncharacteristics of various terrain types. Exact modeling\nof various terrain types is a monumental task as Moore\npoints out (ref. 1) when he infers the magnitude of modeling a forest down to the leaf and pine-needle level. Moore\nfurther points out the lack of adequate scattering information and cites limited programs by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Radiation Laboratory (ref. 2),\nPhilco Corporation (ref. 3), Goodyear Aerospace Corporation\n(ref. 4), General Precision, Inc. (ref. S), and the United\n\n4-4\n\n(4-2)\n\nStates Naval Research Laboratory (refs. 6 to 8). The best\nbackscattering information of near-vertical incidence that Moore\ncites was obtained by Sandia Corporation (refs. 9 and 10), but\nhe further states that in all cases, spotty frequency coverage\nwas obtained.\nMoore describes ground return in terms of a differential cross\nsectional area, a0 , which represents the scattering cross\nsection per unit area and which is designed to eliminate the\ntotal cross section, a , of a large illuminated patch of\nground determined by such system parameters as pulse width and\nbeamwidth and operational mode. The backscattering coefficient\nused in this report differs from Moore\'s usage, for Moore does\nnot use the projected area of the radar pulse packet; i.e.,\no is larger than that seen by the radar along the\nMoore\'s c\nLOS by the sine of the depression angle.\nIn this report, the term "backscattering coefficient" is defined\nin units of scattering cross section per unit area and not as\nthe ratio of the power reflected by an area to the energy incident on that area along a ray between the radar and the reflecting area.\n\n4.3\n\nBACKSCATTERING COEFFICIENT\n\nThe backscattering coefficient, ao , can be described in\nterms of the radar equation and the assumption that the power\nacross the antenna azimuthal beam is constant as follows:\nP GZa20 0 A\n\nt\n\nR\t\n\n(\n\n4Tr)\n\n\t e\t\n\nR\n\n3\n\n4-5\n\n(4-3)\n\n\t\n\nwhere\nPR\n\nis the power received\n\nP t is the power transmitted\nG is the antenna gain\nX\t\n\nis the radiated wavelength\n\nSolving for the backscattering coefficient,\nP (4n)3R4\no _ R\t\ns\t\n\n(4-4)\n\nP G A A\nt\nand substituting for A\n\nQ D\t\n\n,\nP 2(4n)3R3\ns\t\nR\t\n^cT tan e\nP t G\t\n\n(4-5)\n\nfurther substitution that\n\nRs = s1 8\nh\n\nCF O _\t\n\nP 2 (4n) 3h 3 csc 4 6 cos e\nR\nP t G a ACT\n\n4-6\n\n(4-6)\n\nEquation (4-6) shows that for a\n\nconstant\n\nbackscattering co-\n\nefficient from identical type terrains to obtain a constant\nreceived power, P R , the antenna gain must be a function of\ndepression or radar aspect angle, e ; i.e.,\n\n( 4 -7)\n\nG 2 (8) - G 2 csc 4 a cos a\t\nor\nG(e) - G O csc2 8 cos\n\n1/2\n\na\t\n\n(4-8)\n\nThis type of elevation angle gain variation is the frequently\nused gain pattern of a SLR. Further discussion of antenna gain\nis included in other sections of this report.\nAn illustration of the variation in the backscattering coefficient a 0 as a function of terrain and aspect angle (the\ndepression angle from horizontal) is repeated in figure 4-3\n(ref. 7). Figure 4-3 represents data from an airborne SLR\noperating at X band and shows that while terrain with heavy\nvegetation may have a backscattering coefficient of -10 decibels,\nvariations about this value of approximately 4 decibels can be\nexpected depending on what the radar "sees". To reiterate, then,\nthe backscattered energy is a function of aspect angle, which\nis in turn a function of the antenn g pattern in azimuth and\nelevation.\nBy the :-.se of the above mentioned concepts, it is possible to\naescribe a calibration method which is related to the backtattering coefficient, Q o .\n\nThis implies that the parameters\n\nE equation (4-6) are known or can be measured in order to\netermine co.\n\n4 -7\n\nr\n\nO\n\na\n\nw\n\nG\t\n\nw ^\n.a W\nA\n\net 7 `^\n\nQ ^\n7\n^ W\nw\n\na\n\nA\nO\t\n\nN\t\n\nO\nV-4\n\nO\n\nu9\n\nO\t\n\nLn\t\n\nO\n\nin\n\np\n\nLn\t\n\nG\nM\n\nN\nM\n\n(SP) O D IN3IDI33S0:) ONI2i9lIV:)SY:)dB\n\nFigure 4-3. \xe2\x80\x94 Terrain return data.\n\n4-8\n\nO\n\nU\nW\n\nd\nCn\n\nQ\n\nS. TRANSFER FUNCTIONS\nThe transfer functions of all devices through which the radar\nmapping information passes must be accounted for if the calibration of a SLR is to be achieved. These various transfer functions are illustrated in figure S-1 beginning with a radio\nfrequency (rf) input to the receiver.\nFrom figure 5-1, it can be seen that the receiver transfer\nfunction is but one element in a series of transfer\nOthers include the transfer\n\nfunctions of\n\nfunctions.\n\nthe recorder CRT, the\n\nradar data film, the optical correlator, the film maps, a microdensitometer, an analog-to-digital converter and a magnetic\ntape. The use of the above mentioned devices is discussed\nbelow.\nS.1 RECEIVER\nThe receiver rf input versus video output voltage transfer\nfunction must be known in the calibration of a SLR. This\ntransfer function is, in general, a non-linear curve as shown\nin figure 5-1. Ideally, the receiver transfer function would\nbe linear which would allow only a single known input signal\nlevel for calibration. Since linear related signals produce\nnonlinear output voltages, multiple input signals must be used\nto obtain the transfer function curve. This non-linearity of\nthe input-output receiver transfer function must be compensated\nfor in the data processing.\nS.2 RECORDER CRT\nThe receiver video is a bipolar voltage that is used to intensity modulate one or more CRT\'s within the recorder. This\nCRT(s) has an ambient light output, with no modulation, as a\nresult of a direct current NO bias voltage being applied.

The optical system consists\nof the following elements: a coherent light source, a collimating lens, the data film, a conical lens, a cylindrical lens,\na field or integrating lens, an output slit and the output map\nfilm. The action of these elements in the optical correlator/\nprocessor is explained in figure 5-2. The output map film is\nthe radar derived image of the terrain illuminated by the radar\nbeam. The processes involved in obtaining a recognizable output map film by a SLR are shown in figure 5-3.\n5.5 OUTPUT MAP FILM\n\nThe output map film from the optical correlator/processor must\nbe developed by a chemical developing process. This output\nmap film has 8 to 10 discernible grey levels, which must be\nconverted to another information form for reduction by yet\nanother processing technique. One such technique is using a\nmicrodensitometer to sweep an area of interest in the output\nmap film.\n5.6 MICRODENSITOMETER\nA microdensitometer (MD) is a device which has the capability\nof viewing a very small portion of the map film. In this\nviewing process, an optical aperture, which is small in comparison to the image of a point target is scanned across the\nmap film. This scanning operation of the microdensitometer\naperture may be accomplished by an operator or could be programmed to sweep an area of map film in some ordered scan\npattern. The operator can use the signal amplitude directly\nby noting the various signal levels recorded =r-om different\n\n5-5\n\nO\nc\n\nV\n\nN Y O^\n?\n\n>\t\n\nam r\nJ\nw\nO^y\n\n>\n\nC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nlE0\n\n!O\n\nV1\n\n^\n\n7\n\ng\n\n^ \xe2\x80\x94\t\nC\t\n\no\n\n^\n\n^\xc2\xb0,\n\na\n\nC\n\nC\n\ny\nO $ J\nx\na\n\nu\nL\t\n\n>\n\n.N\n\np\xe2\x96\xba\n\nN\nVs\n\n^\n\nC\n\no\n\no M\t\n\nd\n\n+\'\ncd\n\nCL a\t\n\na^\n\ne\xc2\xb0\n\nO\nu\n\nL\n\nM\nd^v\nL\no\n\nS\'\n\na\n\nLL J\n\n0\n\nr\n\nr4\n\ncd\n\nu\n\n$\'\n\nE\n\n.r,\nCL\t\n\nc ^\n\nc\n\nLA-\n\nd\n\n^ a\n0\n\nE\n\nco\n\nr-4\ncd\n\n> J\n\nU\n\nU\n\nL\nC\n\nU^\n\xc2\xb0E\n\n+r\nC\xe2\x96\xba\n\nN\n\nL\n\n01\n\nU.\n\nLL\n\nU\t\n\nC\n\nN\n\n^\'\n\nw\n\ncn\n\nom+\n^\n\nAt\n\nC\n\nc\n\nC\n\nN\n\n00\n\xe2\x80\xa2rl\n\nCDs\n\n0\nE\n\nm\n\nJ N\nC\nCn\nC\n\nV,\n\nN\nN\nC\n\n^\n\n^\n\nJ\n\nNY\n^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nc\xc2\xb0v\n\nev I\n\nC\nd\nJ\n\neo\n\nc\xc2\xb0v\n\n^ ii\n\nO\n\nE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'N\n\nE v c\n\nL\n\nO\n\nU -N\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nfp\n\nJ\n\nC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5-6\n\n(^\nN\n\nLn\nU.\n\ny^\nN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2rl\n\nO\n\nO\nt\n\n9\t\n\nd\n\nOIA\n\nev\n\nD ii\n\n+\'\n\nW4\n\n4-4\n0\n\nM\n\ntd\nM\ncd\n\nu\n0\n\n0\n\nM\n\ng\n\nU\n0\n\n4J\ntn\n\n>,\nth\n41\n\nu\n\xe2\x80\xa2 r4\n\npq\n0\n\n4J\n"A\nen\nLn\n\n04\n\n.r4\n\na\n\ntarget types. If a programmed scan pattern is used, target\namplitude and aperture position must be recorded for each\narea of interest.\nA typical scan pattern for the aperture of the MD is to scan\na line across the film in the x-direction, then move over a\ndistance, by , and repeat the x-direction scan. This scanning\nprocess is repeated a number of times, n , until the area of\ninterest is completely scanned. The position of the aperture,\nin x and y coordinates, as well as the voltage amplitude from\nthe MD, must be recorded. One method is to record x\n\t\n\nyn\n\nand amplitude in digital format on magnetic tape.\n5.7 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER\nThe analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantizes the analog\nvoltage from the microdensitometer, and outputs this voltage in\na digital format. The clock rate required for this ADC will\ndepend on the x-direction sweep rate of the MD. It is anticipated that the clock frequency will be in the kilohertz region.\nFor example, if the x-direction line has 4000 elements scanned\nonce per second and each element is sampled twice, the clock\nfrequency would be 8000 hertz. If there are eight to ten\ndistinct levels of grey on the map film which is viewed by the\nMD, then three to four bits are required to quantize the analog\ninformation into digital information. This quantized map film\ndata is stored on magnetic tape along with quantized information\non the x-y location of the MD aperture. ADC\'s must be used to\nencode these x and y locations in digital format.\n5.8 DIGITAL MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDING\nThe format for digital magnetic tape recording will be determined by the format of the computer which reduces the data.\nFor example, the bit packing density may be 800 bits per inch\n\n5-8\n\nto be computer compatible. The tape will have recorded information on the MD aperture x-y position, target return amplitude,\nand perhaps geometric coordinates of the target if absolute\ntarget location is required. If absolute target location is\ndesired, then latitude/longitude information must be preserved\nby the data film and transferred to the map film.\n\n5-9\n\nIt is anticipated that the radar mapping information will be\nstored on magnetic tape and will be used as the input to a\ncomputer. The software for radar data processing will include\ndescriptions of the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The antenna elevation and azimuth patterns\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transmitter pulse shape and duration\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The transfer functions of all elements from the receiver\nthrough the microdensitometer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The input signal level to the receiver versus signal level\nout of the microdensitometer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Equation (4-6) for calculating backscattering coefficient\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The location of the microdensitometer aperture\nBy processing the radar mapping data and knowing the above\nmentioned parameters, it will be possible to use the computer\nto determine the backscattering coefficient for any mapped\ntarget.\nIf computer data processing is not desired other analog/operator\ncalibration can be used.\n\n6-1\n\nI\n\n7. CALIBRATION METHODS\nTo calibrate a SLR, it is necessary to define the meaning of\nthe term "calibration". As herein defined, the calibration of\na SLR is the ability to relate known reference levels to unknown radar backscatter by the use of one or more calibration\ntechniques.\nCalibration of a SLR requires knowledge of (1) the individual\ntransfer functions of each device through which the radar\nmapping information passes, or (2) an overall transfer function\nof several devices in the calibration chain. These items in\nthe chain (described in section S.) are typical of a SLR employing film recording techniques. Other configurations could\nbe envisioned, but this example is adequate to address the\nproblems encountered.\n7.1 SIMULATED TARGETS\nOne method of calibrating a SLR from the receiver to the microdensitometer (see figure 5-1) is to feed a known signal level\ninto the receiver input port. This calibration signal must be\nfrequency modulated in a manner to simulate real targets and\nmust be recorded on the recorder data film. Typically, this\nfrequency modulation (FM) would be linear for a few hundred\nhertz over a period of a second. Signal power levels of\n-100 dBm to -30 dBm would probably be required to obtain the\ntotal transfer function characteristics from the receiver input\nto the output of the microdensitometer. While this method may\nbe easily accomplished, there are serious drawbacks in that it\nonly partially defines the SLR target response. A better and\nmore highly recommended method would be that of a calibrated\ntest range.\n\n7-1\n\ni\nr\nI\n\n7.2\n\nCALIBRATION TEST RANGE\n\nAt this time, as far as is known, all radar ranges have been\nsponsored by the armed forces and have reflected their need for\nresolution, detection and iden.:ification of small targets (a\ntruck, for instance) in the midst of terrain clutter. The needs\nof an earth .resources program, however, differ in many respects.\nWhile good radar resolution will assist in many facets of earth\nresources studies, the need for a system with wide dynamic\nrange, excellent image smoothing, built-in calibration and related capabilities are equally important. Since these needs\nrequire a different sort of radar test range, the following\nsections provide description for a test range that should prove\nuseful in earth resources studies.\n7.2.1 DISTRIBUTED TARGET RESOLUTION\nMany radar systems have different transfer functions for point\nand distributed targets. Therefore, both types of targets with\na range of reflectivities should be provided. The point targets\nare relatively conventional; a set of carefully sized reflectors\nwill do. However, distributed targets require more thought.\nThese targets should have a constant reflectivity over each\ntarget area and should not change appreciably with the passage\nof time. Large patches of crushed and sized rock have been\nsuggested. Whatever the materials used, the target should be\nlarge enough in extent to contain at least five or six resolvable\nelements of the worst resolution expected of any radar to be\nused on it. In this manner, there is some assurance that the\nproper target is being observed on the radar imagery. Possibly,\nthe most direct approach to measurement of distributed target\nresolution would be to taper the target shape to point to allow\naccurate resolution measurement, and to provide several reflective materials in different patches for a multicontrast\ntarget, much the same as in optics.\n\n7-2\n\n7.2.2 SYSTEM DYNAMIC RANGE MEASUREMENT\nA relatively direct measurement of system dynamic range can be\nmade by imaging a series of known radar reflectors at the same\ntime. Then the system response can be measured for each reflector and the system response can be determined. Care must\nbe taken to fashion the pattern of reflectors so that there\ncan be no doubt about the location and identity of each reflector in the pattern. In addition, the possibility of multipath signals should be minimized by careful design.\nAbove all, any radar test range must be clearly visible and\nunambiguous on the radar imagery. There should be no doubt\nwhatsoever in the mind of the interpreter concerning which\nresolution target or which contrast area is being examined. As\na result of this and the preceding characteristics, it is suggested that a radar calibration site be constructed as shown in\nfigure 7-1. This circular pattern allows for distributed and\npoint target resolution testing, with variable contrast distributed targets. In addition, a complete system dynamic\nrange measurement is available on each radar image.\nVariable contrast distributed targets are formed by the pieshaped segments of material having different particle sizes.\nIn the example shown, all possible combinations of four different reflective surfaces are present, and the resolution on\nany contrast set can be measured by determining the distance\ntoward the center that the pie segment can be distinguished,\neither visually or by an arbitrary power level standard.\nPoint target resolution targets are arranged rather conventionally serving to mark the corners of the site.\nSystem dynamic range measurement is provided by the circle of\ngraduated reflectors which also mark the pie sectors.

The pattern shown is for a 51 dB range of reflectivities at X band, and representative sizes of luneberg\nlens reflectors for such a range of reflectivities are shown\nbelow:\n\nao\t\n\na\t\n\nReflector\nRadius\n\ndB\t\n\nm2\t\n\nm\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nSO\n\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\n\n.10\n.17\n.30\n.S4\n.96\n1.70\n\nThe radar calibration range described here would require\nfour each of eighteen different sizes of calibrated reflectors, together with sixty point target resolution reflectors.\nSuch an arrangement will permit omnidirectional coverage\nwithout the need for readjustment of the reflectors, which is\na desirable characteristic since adjustable reflectors nearly\nalways lead to some doubt in the minds of investigators concerning what the adjustment was on test day. The type of\nreflector recommended for this test range is the luneberg\nlens with a 90\xc2\xb0 cap. This reflector has the small physical\ndimensions required for the resolution targets and has a\nhigh reflectivity which is nearly constant over a 90\xc2\xb0 solid\nangle making it desirable for system response uaeasurement.\nThus, each dynamic range reflector site should consist of\nfour reflectors of the same size, arranged back-to-back in\npairs. Since the radar reflectivity of the ground around\nthe reflectors will contribute to the received signal, it\nis desirable to have the area around the reflectors as smooth\nand level as practicable. It is suggested that the reflectors all face parallel to the sides of the square test\n7-S\n\npattern, as indicated in the figure, and that each reflector\nface upward at an angle of approximately 40\xc2\xb0 from the horizontal in order to provide adequate vertical coverage.\nReflectors having a 10 m 2 radar cross section at 10 Gc a7e \t\nrecommended for the resolution targets for 10-foot spacing\nand greater, with 1 m 2 targets for less than 10-foot spacing.\nIt is apparent that all of the reflectors used for calibration targets must be measured for reflectivity pattern after\nfabrication, and that the reflector pattern and location\nsh. )uld be made available to each investigator using the radar\nimagery.\nThe sand and gravel beds constituting the distributed\ntarget pat t ern should be laid on top of the ground, rather\nthan set into the soil. This will minimize changes due to\nstanding water or silt deposition. A bed thickness of 1 foot\nwill be adequate for all except the 3/8 inch rocks, which\nmay have to be 1-1/2 feet thick to provide a complete ground\ncover. The perimeter of the circle can be of any desired\nrestraining material, such as a ridge of dirt, but it must\nhave adequate provisions for water drainage. The sector\ndividers, however, should be made of, or covered with, an\nabsorbent material such as Eccosorb. This will prevent\nreflections from the dividers or edge effects from interfering\nwith the resolution measurement process.\nA pattern such as this offeYs several advantages to the radar\nsystem user:\n1.\n\nDistributed target multicontrast resolution test pattern\nwith essentially infinite variable resolution capability\n(from 0 to 390 feet).\n\n2.\n\nComplete radar system dynamic range measurement and calibration over a 50 dB range and limited capability for distributed target dynamic range testing.\n7-6\n\nR\n\nI\n\t\nt\t\n\ni\n\nj\n\n3.\n\nPoint target resolution test patterns of spacing down to\n1 foot.\n\n4.\n\nShort term geometric fidelity test capability.\n\nAll of these system measurements are available on each and e,rery\nradar image of the test pattern, without imposing critical\nliritations on flight path position or requiring coordinated\nground operations.\n7.2.3 PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhen designing and constructing a radar test range, it might be\nwell to consider the various difficulties which may be encountered. For example, it may be difficult to:\n1.\n\nPlace the test range where no nearby objects or terrain\ncan cause confusion about the location of the test range\nor its boundaries.\n\n2.\n\nArrange the test pattern so that it is completely unambiguous\non the imagery.\n\n3.\n\nDesign the test range to eliminate the need for coordinated\nground activity, i.e., no adjustments to reflector positrons\nbefore a flight, etc. A range with fixed, well-known,\nomnidirectional characterist 4.cs is highly desirable.\n\nQ.\n\nConstruct the range to minimize the effects of time and\nweather upon its response.\n\nS. Select a site for the test range which allows using aircraft sufficient airspace to image the site freely from\nmori than one side. Mountains, airport control areas, and\nairways can cause varying amounts of interference with the\nflight of the test aircraft.\n6. Make certain that the test site is not open to the casual\nvisitor.\n\n7-7\n\n7. Design the test pattern to yield a maximum of infcrmation\nwith a minimum of flights and to be flexible enough to\nserve radar systems yet to be acquired.\n\n7-8\n\n8.
