Within the context of this objective, the following goals were set: (1) characterize the present mobile communications industry; (2) determine the market for an improved system for mobile communications; and (3) define the system requirements as seen from the potential customer's viewpoint. The scope of the study was defined by the following parameters: (1) markets were confined to U.S. and Canada; (2) range of operation generally exceeded 20 miles, but this was not restrictive; (3) the classes of potential users considered included all private sector users, and non-military public sector users; (4) the time span examined was 1975 to 1985; and (5) highly localized users were generally excluded - e.g., taxicabs, and local paging.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760019170, "id": "e5bf177748104adb85fed3b0a2678d17", "publicationDate": "1976-04-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760019170.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760019170/downloads/19760019170.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760019170/downloads/19760019170.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760019170/downloads/19760019170.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
