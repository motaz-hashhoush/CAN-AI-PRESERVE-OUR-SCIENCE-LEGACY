b'Acoustic Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bag Abstract\nThe Logistics Reduction (LR) project within the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program is tasked\nwith reducing logistical mass and repurposing logistical items. Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bags (MCTB)\nare designed to be the same external volume as a regular cargo transfer bag, the common logistics\ncarrier for the International Space Station. After use as a cargo bag, the MCTB can be unzipped and\nunfolded to be reused. This Acoustic MCTBs transform into acoustic blankets after the initial logistics\ncarrying objective is complete.\n\nCR 014398\n\nAcoustic Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bag\nOverview\n\nSponsoring

approval through\nthe DAA system for the external release of information regarding the\nAcoustic Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bag\n\nPage No. 2\nISS_CM_019 (Rev 03/2015)\n\nProject Background \xe2\x80\x93 T2 Sound Level\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGround acoustic testing of the T2 treadmill rack was conducted as part of the flight\ncertification testing in February 2009, and on-orbit measurements of the T2 rack were\nmade after it was installed in the temporary location in Node 2 and the current location\nin Node 3\nBecause the current sound level at high speed reaches the hazard limit, the T2 has\nbeen added to the Noise Hazard Inventory, and hearing protection has become\nmandatory above 10 mph per the Noise Constraint Flight Rule 13-152\n\nPage No. 3\nISS_CM_019 (Rev

incidence\nabsorption measurements with different material layups to determine the best option\nThe preferred layup was determined to be blue Nomex\xe2\x84\xa2, Thinsulate\xe2\x84\xa2, and two layers\nof gold Durette fabric implemented in a dual layer acoustic treatment\nAcoustic modelling of Node 3 showed that implementing the proposed acoustic\nMCTBs on two walls in Node 3 reduces the noise by ~3 dBA at different tread\nspeeds measured at the runner\xe2\x80\x99s head location\nSince dBA is measured on a logarithmic scale, a 3 dBA reduction is a halving of the\nsound energy\n\nGold

Exploration Systems (AES)\nprogram is tasked with reducing logistical mass and repurposing logistical items\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The LR team has developed the Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bag (MCTB), which can be\nreconfigured to serve other purposes after providing their primary logistical function\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The technology demonstration of the MCTB will be launched as a CTB and will then be\nreconfigured into an acoustic blanket\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Acoustic MCTB (AMCTB) has been designed with a material layup specifically\ndesigned to absorb sound\n\nPage No. 6\nISS_CM_019 (Rev

Adhere the treatment to the wall using Velcro\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Total crew time for integration = ~30-45 min\n\xe2\x80\x93 This does not include removing bag contents or\nacoustic testing after integration\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 There will be holes/patches on the MCTBs that will\nbe used on the Avionics-2 rack to allow access to\nthe two fireports and rack power switch.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bungees can be used to secure the MCTBs, if\nnecessary, but should be minimized as\ncompression may reduce the effectiveness of the\nacoustic treatment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 On-orbit acoustic testing shall be performed at the\nrunner\xe2\x80\x99s head location to quantify noise levels\nbefore and after installation\n\xe2\x80\x93 This will be done as a part of the nominal SLM\nsurvey - no additional crew time is
