Some of the new machines proved very useful, others\nare no longer in use, as more efficient methods for their purposes were\nachieved.\n1.1 SHAPED QUARTZ LDMS\nTo improve the purity of the pulled crystals, quartz liners were\ntried. This proved to be a futile move. During the pulling process\nthe metals reacted with the quartz. It also proved difficult to\nseparate the reacted portions of the crystals fr-m the remainders.\nTherefore we went back to plain crucibles.\n1.2 IMPROVED FURNACE\nThe improved furnac- proved to be a success. We have not\nexperienced a single heating difficulty during the report period.\n1.3 METALLURGICAL MORTAR\nThe newly obtained metallurgical mortar proved very useflal in\nt\n\nreducing the size of the crystals. At first it was used at LN2\ntemperature, but this was stopped as the brittle crystals crack at\nroom temperature.\n\npage 2\n\n1.4 FREEzER MILL\nThe Spex freezer mill is no longer being used, as much better\ndevices for cracking have been acquired.\n1.5 BALL MILL\nA ball mill of our design was developed to continue and\neventually substitute cracking in the metallurgical mortar. After\na run of 24 hours, the powders had to be sieved and decanted several\ntimes to arrive at the desired size (5-10 \xc2\xb5). This operation proved\nto be lengthy and the final output small. The use of the ball mill\ntherefore has been discontinued.\n1.6 STIR PLATE\nTo facilitate decanting, a Thermolyne stirplate was obtained.\nIt consists of a hotplate, adjustable for temperatures up to 370\xc2\xb0C\nand a separately controlled magnetic stirrer. With this it is\npossible to evaporate the water from the last decanting stage and\nto obtain powders very easily.\n1.7 AUTOMATIC MORTAR AND PESTILE\nTo grind the powders obtained from the metallurgical mortar,\nan automatic mortar and pestle (Fisher mortar grinder) was acquired.\nThe original mortar and pestle of aluminum oxide were relatively large\nand capable of handling a substantial amount of material. Their surfaces,\nhowever, were far from smooth; the finest powders produced were of the\norder of 5 p. A tungsten carbide mortar and pestle was then obtained\nwhich can handle at most a few grams of material, but it achieves a\nfurther size reduction to powders of about 1 u size. From these powders\nwe have produced our first satisfactory electrodes.\n\npage 3\n\n2.\t\n\nPRODUCTION OF POWDERS\n\n2.1 PULVERIZING OF CRYSTAIB\nCrystals of different weights up to roughly one pound of AuCu,\naluminum d: lped, have been pulled. The segregation coefficient of\naluminum was unknown. It was hoped that this would turn out to be\nnear unity. This, however, was not the case.\nNormally, in any one boule, only the lower third was brittle\n(at room temperature). The rest would be ductile. In one case the\nlower third weighed about 120 grams; this portion could be cracked in\na metallurgical mortar, at first into large pieces which show the\nfamiliar crystalline appearance of natural rock crystal, being\naggregates of single crystals measuring up to 4 to 6 = in the side.\nThese could be powdered further, and the resulting powders\npassed through a set of sieves, the smallest of these being a 325\nmesh. The fraction that had passed through the 325 mesh ranges from\nquite small to roughly 40/u with an average size of the order of 10 Ai.\nThese particles were ground in an automatic mortar and pestle\n(Fisher mortar grinder) for a few hours; a powder was obtained with\na different distribution of particle sizes. These turned out to be\ndivided into two readily separated groups, one consisting of the larger\nparticles, the other of particles of about 5Aa size. The proportion\nof the smaller particles was substantial. Thus, by stirring in\ndistilled water, decanting, and drying the decanted portion, a substantial amount of 5ia size crystals was accumulated.\n\n^R.\'\n\npage 4\n\nThe results so obtained demonstrated that it would be more\nprofitable to proceed, if possible, to produce still finer powders.\nAs mentioned in 1o7 this led to the purchase of a tungsten carbide\nmortar and pestle, giving us particle sizes of the order of 1 At.\n\nTo improve the final results, however, an even smaller particle\nsize is desirable. A longer time of grinding will increase the\nrelative amount of the small particle fraction without producing a\nlarge decrease in the ultimate size.\n\nTo further minimize the particle size, an appropriate surfactant\nis required, which has to be determined by trial. The surfactants,\noften ionic salts, are dissolved in a volatile carrier. Some effective\nsalts and carriers are: Ce(NO 3 ) ; Al(NO 3 ) ; K3Fe(CN) 6; K4Fe(CN)6\nand absolute ethyl alcohol; cyclohexane ; n- heptane ; methylene\nchloride.\n\nOnce an appropriate combination of carrier and salt is found;\none should be able to obtain particle sized below 0.1)u in the\ntungsten carbide grinder.\n2.2 INERT GAS JET\n\nAlternatively it was known that a thin stream of molten metal\nsubmitted to pulses of an impinging gas stream modulated at high\nfrequency, higher than 80 Kc, could be shattered in particles of\nuniform, small size, of the order of 00)u. Further, the little\nliquid globules would freeze as perfect single crystals, as the\nchances of more than one nucleation center occurring in such a small\nbody and during such a short period of time is very remote.\n\npage 5\n\nThis method is fully instrumented, vacuum tight, and "ready to\ngo". However, an experimental period and sundry small modifications\nto the apparatus will undoubtedly be needed before small powders are\nachieved. These can be either of the body- or the face-centered variety.\n\nRecently it was learned that the present method may not be\noptimal for this purpose, rather that a powerful gas het, acting on\nthe metal emerging from a specially designed nozzle may be needed.\nWe are investigating this possibility that would, in effect, greatly\nsimplify the problem.\n\npcge\n\n3\t\n\n5\n\nPRODUCTION OF ELECTRODES\n\nWe started with the naive assumption that the manufacturing of\nelectrodes should be similar for Pt black and AuCu prnvders. In\ndoing so, we encountered a number of difficulties, since our material\ndiffers so much in size, weight, wettability, etc., from Pt black.\n\nOur next problem was to keep the particles in suspension long\nenough, e.g., for the whole process of application. After it had\nproved impossible to suspend the 10/u size powders in Teflon 30\nadditives designed to produce a \' higher viscosity fluid were\nincorporated. This, however, did not fulfil its purpose for these\nrelatively large particles. Only after grinding them down to 5au\nsize did the catalyst suspend well in the Teflon 30 plus 10 volume\nToluene.\n\nAt first, manual application of this suspension with a emall\nspatula on 75 wire N1 screen was attempted. This resulted in\nelectrodes covered extremely unevenly with catalyst and therefore\nuseless for evaluation in cells,\n\nTo arrive at a more even application, an artist\'s airbrush was\ntried, the nozzle of which clogged easily, This method was soon\ndiscarded.\n\nFinally a relatively even application was achieved with a\nredesigned spraygun.\n\npage 7\n\nThe Ni screen was mounted on a heating unit and sprayed with\nsuspension which was dried on the screen. The application was repeated till about the same loading as the commercially produced\nelectrodes ras achieved. Then it was cured and cut to size.\nThe problem encountered here was that the catalyst powders\npiled up on the screen wires, not occupying any of the intervening\nareas. This of course results in a higher resistance; and worse, only\npart of the mounted catalysts is actually effective. Our results\ntherefore are mower than they could be, provided an effective application\nof the powders to the screen is developed.\nAt present it is planned to mount the powders using a rubber\nroller in a method similar to linoleum printing. This method will be\nstudied during the next report period.\n\npage 8\n\n4.\t\n\nTESTING AND RESULTS\n\nWe obtained our results by two different methods; firstly by\nmeasuring chunks of coarsely polycrysta]]j ne materials in half cells\nand secondly by measuring the electrodes in demountable fuel cells.\nE\n4.1 TESTING OF COME OF COARSELY\n\nPOLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIAL\n\nAs already mentioned, the crackable lower third of the boules\nheld more Al than one would have expected, if the distribution had been\nconstant throughout the boule. The testing in half cells showed\nclearly that influence of both the surface and the interstitial\naluminum; it dissolved in the KOH solutions, thus creating a counter\nvoltage as\n\nNell as\n\nan opposing anodic current to those generated by the\n\ncatalyst.\n\nEven so the results obtained were very encouraging:\n\na)\n\nThe catalytic activity of the aggregate crystals was two to\nthree times better than Pt in the areas below 0.5 mA.\nIn higher current areas the current to voltage ratio\nincreases very considerably in favor of the AuCu catalyst.\n\nb)\n\nThe crystals themselves were in no way attacked by the KOH,\nthus showing that the alloys are still ordered in the bodycentered structure; an AuCu wire containing 50% by weight\nof Au and Cu (i.e., not ordered) dissolved rapidly in the\nsame solution.\n\nI\n\npage 9\n4.2 TESTING OF ELECTRODES IN A REDESIGNED FUEL CELL\nAfter redesigning our demountable Teflon cel.A., mch more consistent\nresults were obtained.\nThe first Ni electrode sprayed with a suspension of Ip\nbrittle AuCu has been tested under the following conditions:\n30 mils Johns Manville Asbestos saturated with 5 n KOH solution at\na pressure of 1 Atm. of Oxygen and Hydrogen and 75 0 C. The results\nwere substantially better than the best reported in the literature for\nPt black made under similar conditions. One obtains for instance\n0.8 V for 250 mA/cm2 . For approximately equal loading and similar\n\nconditions the best current reported by American Cyanamide was about\n150 mA/cm2 . However, our electrodes are quite defective due to our\nstill very imperfect knowledge of how best to mount the powders.\nOur electrodes are at least 50% transparent against about\n15 to 10% for American Cyanamide electrodes, have a higher\nresistance and actually use only the minor portion of the catalyst\nthat is in actual contact with the electrode. More sophisticated\ntechniques of electrode preparation are now being initiated and it is\nexpected that the current will double for half the loading. Also, any\nfurther reduction in size of catalyst powders as contemplated in 2,2\nwill increase the currer.t proportionately.\n\npage 10\n\n5.\t\n\nFUTURE PROGRAM\nOne can extrapolate from curve No. 1 what the p::obable curranta\n\nand voltages will be, if 0.1 ,p are used instead of 1 p powders. If\none further allows for improvements in the preparation of the electrode,\netc., the current density will increase by a very large factor.\nOne can for instance predict that under the same conditions as\ncurve No.,], one should be able to get of the order of 4OOmA at 0.97mV.\nAt 0.9 volts the current density figures to be in excess of 2.5 A, It\nis therefore in the interest of the program that we pursue the followin.&,\n5.1 REDUCTION OF POWDERS TO 0.1 p AND LESS\nRNduction of size of the AuCu catalyst to 0.1 \xc2\xb5 and possible less.\nTo this purpose we have acquired the necessary lubricants and surfactants\nas well as an extra automatic grinder (Fisher mortar grinder). Unfortunately\nthe output is rather low - of the order of\n\nwill not\n\n6g\n\nper week and even this\n\nstart for another week or two. Hence it will obviously be\n\naround the end of the year before new electrodes utilizing these\npowders are available.\n5.2 IMPROVEMENT OF MOUN\'T\'ING METHOD\nImprovement of mounting method. We will continue to attempt to\nimprove our methods of powder mounting until uniformly, finely, fissured\nelectrodes become routine. We will use Pt black at first, shifting to\nour catalyst when they become available.\nBecause of the urgency of these programs ,, other programs aimed at\nstudying different catalysts from the one we have already obtained are\nto be undertaken only if time permits.\n\npage 11\n\n5.3\n\nDESIGN OF PERMANENT FUEL CELL\n\nWe shall begin the design of a small fuel cell element of\npermanent character, able to reject water for the purpose of future\ntests.\nBecause of the urgency of these programs, other programs aimed\nat studying different catalysts from the one we have already obtained\nare to be undertaken only if time permits.\n\nN\t\nO\n\nr-1\nG)\n\nJ\nP+\n\nto\n\n0\nO\n\nU\nco\n\nm\n\n.r\nfi\n\nv\nU\n\nJ\n\nN\n\n41\nb\n\nm\nO\nw\n\n^d\n\nr.. i\tm\nv\n\n^ ^ N\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \' -I U P\n\nca\n\nH J U h\n:^, v v m\nd v v \xe2\x80\xa2^\n\no x m\n\nO 01 GO t ^O W\' 4 M N\n\nN\nO\n9\n\n-\n\n-\n\nM\nO\n00\nM\nM\n\nO\n\nM\n\nO\n\nM\nG\n\nM\nM\n\nM\nO\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nO\n0\n\no\n\nN\n\n0\nON\n\nN\n\nO\n- c0\nO\n\nN\n\n_ L\n\nN\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\nO\n\nN\n0\n\nr\n\nU\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\nLO\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\n_ N\nN\n\n_\n\nO\n\nN\n\nO\n\nO\n^- M\n\n.-\n\nO\n^- O\nr O\n\nO\\\nO\n\nh-\n\nO\n\nO\nO\nO\n\nO\nM\n\nAI\nO\n\n'
