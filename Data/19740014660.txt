measurement techniques for\nremote manipulation tasks and remote sensing techniques for manipulators.\nFor common manipulation tasks, performance is monitored by means of an\non-line computer capable of measuring the joint angles of both master and\nslave arms as a function of time.\n\nThe computer programs allow measure-\n\nments of the operator\'s strategy and physical quantities such as task time\nand power consumed.\n\nThe results are printed out after a test run to com-\n\npare different experimental conditions.\nFor tracking tasks, we describe a method of displaying errors in\nthree dimensions and measuring the end-effector position in three\ndimensions.\nWe also report progress on remote sensing systems based both on touch\nand distance sensing.\n\nThe touch-sensing system uses proportional force\n\nsensors distributed over the remote hand to measure the overall force\ndistribution of objects against the hand.\n\nThe range sensor uses reflec-\n\ntion from infrared light beams to identify the position of objects at\na distance of a few centimeters to more than 20 centimeters in front of\nthe hand.\n\nii\n\nCONTENTS\n\nABSTRACT\n\n. . .\n\n. .\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLIST OF

remote sensing and display techniques to augment man\'s\n\nmanipulative skills.\n\nMuch of the work is a further development of the\n\nmanipulator system previously described.l*\nTo study human performance both in the time delay situation and\nsituations using different displays, manipulators, and controls, the\npilot experiments of Sections II and III were carried out.\n\nThe pilot\n\nexperiments provided a data bank for the logging and analysis programs\ndeveloped in Section V; the new data analysis techniques are being tested\nout and debugged.\n\nSection V describes the experimental configuration for\n\ncarrying out both compensatory and pursuit tracking tasks in space.\nthe multicoordinate tracking program previously described,\'\n\nWith\n\nit will be\n\npossible to measure describing function remnant spectra and root-meansquare (rms) tracking errors.\nFor automatic control of remote manipulators and to enable man to\nhave better manipulative skills, certain features of the remote environment must be sensed.\n\nSections VI and VII describe the continued develop-\n\nment of sensors for this purpose.\n\nDevelopment of the touch sensing sys-\n\ntem begun under NASA-SNSO support 2 is being continued here.\n\nThe goal is\n\nto develop a touch sensing and display system that gives man the "feel"\nof the remote objects he is handling.\n\nReferences are listed on page 32 of this report.\n\n1\n\nII\n\nPILOT TACTILE DISPLAY EVALUATION\n\nExperiment I approximates the experiment described in Appendix F\nof Reference 1.\n\nThe only modification of the experiment was to perform\n\neight repeated pick-up attempts instead of ten.\n\nSince performance seemed\n\nto be improving as the experiment progressed, the entire experiment was\nrepeated a second time in reverse order.\n\nWe hope that the additional\n\ndata can be used to plot learning curves and that both learning rates and\nultimate performance levels can be used to differentiate between experimental conditions.\nPerformance measurements consist of both the task time for each run\nas measured by a stopwatch and the number of fumbles or drops occurring\nduring each experimental condition.\n\nIn all conditions except the visual\n\nsensor display, the performance monitor package described in Section IV\nof this report was used.\nAt the present time the data from the experiment are being reduced\nand prepared for plotting, analyses of variance, and other statistical\ntests.\n\n2\n\nIII\n\nA.\n\nPILOT TIME DELAY EXPERIMENT\n\nGeneral\nThis experiment investigates changes in the operator\'s manipulation\n\nstrategy as the transmission delay is varied over a wide range.\n\nThe\n\napproach is to obtain a bank of human performance data using the datalogger described in Section IV of this report and then to experiment\nwith several performance indices to find those that best characterize\nthe changes in strategy from a continuous strategy to a move-and-wait\nstrategy as the time delay increases from zero to well over one second.\nThe areas of particular interest are numbers of moves, relations of arm\nmotion to decisions to move, and descriptions of the complex move-andwait strategy.\n\nThe measurements made by the off-line analyses of Sec-\n\ntion IV represent an initial attempt to obtain such indices.\n\nThe results\n\nof this pilot time-delay experiment will probably suggest other still\nmore pertinent manipulation parameters to be obtained while an experiment\nis being carried out.\n\nB.\n\nMethod\nThe experiment is arranged in a 3 X 5 x 2 factorial design, as shown\n\nin Figure 1.\n\nEach cell in the design represents a performance charac-\n\nteristic measured on two subjects in eleven repetitions of the task.\nThe experiment variables are (1) manual control mode, (2) transmission delay, and (3) replication, as indicated in Figure 1.\n\nThe manual\n\ncontrol mode is varied by use of either the Rancho master brace or a\nbank of six potentiometers.\n\nTransmission delays from zero to ten seconds\n\nare provided in both control conditions, and in all replications by using\n\n3\n\n3\n\n0\n\n00\n\nw3\n\nKNOBS\nBRACE\nCONTROL\nSA-1587-33R\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nDESIGN OF THE PILOT TIME DELAY\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nthe 30-Hz delay line simulation described in Section\n\nII of Reference 1.\n\nDirect viewing was used and audio cues were provided in all\n\nexperimental\n\ncases.\n\n1.\n\nApparatus\n\nThe Rancho arm and computer augmented control\nin Section\n\nII of Reference 1 were used\n\nmodes were solely manual,\n\nfor this experiment.\n\nmaster-slave modes.\n\nthan direct vision was provided\n\nsystem described\nThe control\n\nNo sensory feedback other\n\nto the operator.\n\nThe task was to pick\n\nup a block randomly placed within the arm workspace and deposit\nsmall container.\n4\n\nit in a\n\n2.\n\nSubjects\nTwo male subjects, LM and SM, were used for this experiment.\n\nBoth had considerable experience in using the manual control modes for a\npick-up task.\n\nHowever, neither subject had ever attempted the task with\n\na transmission delay.\n\n3.\n\nProcedure\nThe on-line performance logger (see Section IV) is started when\n\nthe end effector passes through a plane one-foot above the table on the\nway down to grasp the object.\n\nThe task is complete when the object is\n\ngrasped and deposited in the receptacle, and the end effector moves up\nout of the workspace.\n\nThen the performance logger stops.\n\nIn a single replication, each subject performed 10 runs consisting\nof 11 repetitions each.\n\nFive runs, each corresponding to one of the\n\ntransmission delays, were performed using each of the two control modes.\nThis sequence was repeated three times for each subject.\n\nIn all,\n\neach\n\nsubject made 333 individual pick-up attempts.\n\nC.\n\nAnalyses Underway\n1.\n\nPerformance Measures\nA 5 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 11 analysis of variance of each of the per-\n\nformance indices determined by the performance monitor (Section IV) is\nbeing carried out to determine their relative importance in differentiating between test conditions.\n\n2.\n\nMovement Time Distribution\nWe plan Chi-square analyses to determine whether the movement\n\ntime distribution (Section IV) changes significantly with varying transmission delay and control\n\ninput.\n5\n\nIV\n\nEXPERIMENT ANALYSIS TOOLS\n\nA performance monitor package was created to study (1) the complex\nmove-and-wait strategy and\nferent\n\n(2) the movement and waiting times with dif-\n\ntransmission delays, different visual and tactile feedback, and\n\ndifferent arms.\n\nThe performance monitor can measure and tabulate the\n\nmovement and waiting times with considerably greater accuracy and reliability than can a human observer with a stopwatch.\nThe performance monitor package consists of an on-line program for\ndata logging and several off-line programs for numerical analysis.\n\nDuring\n\nthe experimental runs, a high-speed disk memory logs on-line data.\n\nUpon\n\ncompletion of the experiment, it is copied to magnetic tape for permanent\nstorage.\n\nDifferent off-line programs are used to search the log and to\n\nextract the desired performance indices.\n\nThis section gives the descrip-\n\ntion of the components of this performance measuring system.\n\nA.\n\nUsing the On-Line Performance Logger\nThe control codes available to the experimenter for accumulating\n\nand logging data are shown in the control tree of Figure 2.\n\nA typical\n\ncontrol sequence for logging two replications of an experiment is shown\nin Figure 3, where information typed by the operator is underlined.\n\nB.\n\nOperation of the On-Line Performance Logger\nThe on-line performance logger detects the beginning and end of moves\n\nby using derivatives of the individual joint angles.\n\nIn total, 14\n\nAn alternative method of detecting moves based on a calculation of\ninstantaneous joint velocity is being investigated.\n\n6\n\nP\n"PERFORMANCE\nMONITOR"\n\nI

slave\n\ndigitally filtered every 1/30 of a second.\n\njoints exceeds a predetermined threshold for motion during a 1/30-second\nperiod, a note of the fact is made in separate master and slave move\ndetection queues.\n\nThese queues\n\n(software shift registers) record whether\n\nor not a move was detected during 12 successive 1/30-second intervals.\nFrom these intermediate data, decisions are made to determine whether a\nmaster or slave move has begun or ended.\nmonitor is given in Figure 4.\n\nThe flow chart of the performance\n\nThe criteria for detecting the beginnings\n\nand ends of moves that have proved successful are defined below:\n*\n\nMove criterion--A move begins when the velocity threshold is exceeded during the current 1/30-second interval and will be exceeded\non five of the next 12 intervals.\n\n*\n\nDone criterion--A move is done when the velocity threshold is not\nexceeded during the current interval and will not be exceeded more\nthan once in the next 12 intervals.\nThe on-line program\n\nTwo total task measurements are also obtained.\n\ncounts the number of 1/30-second intervals taken to complete a task and\nlogs the total at the end to permit the calculation of task duration.\nAdditionally, it accumulates the current delivered by the 24-volt servo\npower supply every 1/30 second and logs the total at the end of the run to\npermit calculation of the total energy consumed.\n\nThe first three numbers\n\nfollowing the "/" symbol are the triple precision accumulation of the\ncurrent, and the next two are the double precision accumulation of the\ntask time.\nMessages entered during the run are printed directly in the data log.\nEntering the "kill" message during a run causes a "?"\non the data log and further logging to cease.\n\nsymbol

6.\n\nEach of the data files analyzed consists of 11 replications\n\nof a pickup and drop task carried out with a time delay of one second.\nThe performance indices are printed out in the same order as they are\ndefined in Table 2.\n\nD.\n\nTimes are in seconds and energy is in kilowatt seconds.\n\nOff-Line Histogram Program\nIn order to investigate changes in the operator\'s strategy under\n\nexperimental conditions such as time delays, we wrote a program to obtain\nthe distribution of move times.\n\nThe algorithm is essentially that of the\n\nwell-known "pulse-height analyzer."\nIn the move-time analyzer there are 51 bins for accumulating counts.\nWhen a master move (indicated by a "#" in the data log) is found, the\nappropriate bin is incremented by one to count the move.\n\nThe first bin\n\nis for move durations of 1/30, 2/30, and 3/30 second (0.03 to 0.1\nthe second bin is for durations of 4/30, 5/30, and 6/30 second\n\nsecond);\n\n(.13 to\n\n.2 second); and so the bins continue to the highest bin which accumulates\nall moves greater than 150/30 seconds\n\n(5 seconds).\n\nAfter all the desired\n\ndata logs are searched, a printout of the bins can be requested.\nAn example of using the program and its resultant output is shown\nin Figure 7.\n\nHere the data analyzed are the same as those of Figure 6.\n\nAs Figure 7 indicates, there were 22 test runs and 447 master moves; the\nmean value of the ensuing distribution is 1.257 second.\ntotals is printout of the bin totals.\n\nFollowing the\n\nThe first number on each line is\n\nthe bin count, and the second is the lower bound of each bin in seconds.\nThe bin counts are illustrated graphically by printing one space for each\nmove in the bin followed by an asterisk.\nAs in Figure 7, whenever a moderate number (447) of moves is tabulated\nin this way, the distribution is noisy.\n12\n\nFor purposes of comparing two\n\nEXAMIN*SM3\nSUBJECT SM BLOCK\n\nPICKUP AND DROP\n\nTIME DELAY a

to do tracking experiments, where the operator is required\n\nto trace a path in space, a three-dimensional display is required.\n\nThe\n\noperator must be able to look at the display and quickly assess his position error along X, Y, and Z coordinates.\nA display suitable for this task consists of a movable circle and dot\non an oscilloscope screen and a set of fixed, cross lines as shown in\nFigure 10.\n\nThe circle and dot can quickly be visualized as an arrow\n\npointing either into or out of the oscilloscope screen.\n\nWith X and Y\n\nerrors, both the circle and dot move left and right or up and down in\nunison; with Z errors the circle moves up and down with respect to the\ndot.\n\nA photograph of the actual display as seen on the scope screen is\n\nshown in Figure 11.\nThe circuitry used to produce the display is shown in Figure 12.\nCommand inputs for the three coordinates are generated by the computer;\nresponse inputs for the three coordinates come from three position-sensing\npotentiometers that monitor the position of the manipulator end point;\nerror outputs go to the computer for on-line analysis.\n\nThe 200-Hz multi-\n\nvibrator drives two field-effect switching transistors, causing the\ndeflection outputs to follow alternately the X and Y errors directly or\nthe X and Y + Z errors with an AC perturbation generating the circle.\nThis display can also be used to present two-dimensional, pursuit\ntracking tasks (the circle in the command position and the dot representing the operator\'s actual position).\n\n18\n\nBy commanding the

for the Space\nNuclear Systems Office under Contract SNSN-63.\n\nThe goal of this work was\n\nto design a system to provide, through a teleoperator, the touch information normally used by man in directly manipulating objects with his hands.\nAlthough Contract SNSN-63 was prematurely halted because the Space Nuclear\nSystemsOfficewas closed, SRI had already completed the design of a set\nof sensorized tongs that can be fitted to the Navy arm.\nThe previous work included (1) an overall design of a touch feedback\nsystem, (2) a selection of a sensor system based on bench-top tests, and\n(3) a selection of actuator systems based on bench-top tests, and (4) the\ndesign of a set of tongs based on results of 1 and 2.\n\nTo date, we have\n\nbuilt the pair of tongs and designed and almost completed the wrist and\nlinks to control the tongs.\n\nThe results of this previous project and the\n\nadaptation of the system to the NASA-Ames arm are given in integral form\nfor the first time in this report.\n\nB.\n\nTactile Feedback Considerations\nDesigns for a touch sensing system should consider (1) individual\n\nsensors and actuators,\nthe end-effector, and\ntongs.\n\n(2) the optimum encapsulation of the sensors in\n(3) the arrangement of particular sensors on the\n\nThe handgrip of the controller should serve the purposes of\n\n(1) providing a handle for transmitting six degrees of force to the arm\n\n24\n\ncontroller, (2) displaying tactile quantities to the hand, and (3) providing one degree of freedom for opening and closing the end-effector.\nThe integration of the important touch quantities into this control\nsituation is shown in Figure 15.\nBased on our feasibility studies (surveys of sensor and actuator\ntechnologies 2 ) and the requirement of fitting the system to the Navy endeffector3 and the MIT hand controller,4 we have several recommendations\nfor a tactile sensing system.\nPrimarily, it should convey two types of touch information to the\nhuman operator.\n\nOne of these is contact or touch with a high spatial\n\nresolution based on a matrix of sensors on the jaw surfaces and a corresponding matrix of position reproducing actuators on the palmar surfaces\nof the human finger and thumb.\n\nThe other type is contact or touch with\n\nlow resolution for relaying touch quantities from the exterior of the\nend-effector to the man\'s hand as force reproducing actuators on the\nbacks, sides, and tips\n\nof the human finger and\n\nthumb.\n\nThe high resolution system should have at least a 3 x\nsensor buttons\ncompletely.\n\n6 matrix of\n\nthat cover the end-effector gripping surfaces almost\n\nThe low resolution system should have two sensitive\n\n(uniformly sensitive\n\nsurfaces\n\nto force over the entire surface) on each exterior\n\nsurface of the tongs.\n\nEventually, two commonly used\n\nprehension quantitites,\n\nforce feedback\n\nand slippage feedback, should be included in a tactile sensing\n\nsystem.\n\nThe role and implementation of these quantities is suggested in Figure 15\nand implementation of them into the system would give man nearly complete\n"feel"\n\nof the remote environment.\n\n25\n\nEND\n\nTOUCH QUANTITIES\n\nEFFECTOR\n\nCONTROL AND\n\nTO BE MEASURED\nAND DISPLAYED\n\nDISPLAY\n\nSLIPPAGE\n\nLOW RESOLUTION\n\nHIGH RESOLUTION\n\nOF OBJECTS\nIN JAWS\n\nEXTERNAL

Touch quantities commonly used by man\nin prehension are sensed on the end effector and anthropomorphically displayed on the hand controller. Dashed\nboxes are not to be considered in this study.\n\nC.\n\nSelection of Touch Sensors\nAfter a survey of sensing mechanisms and bench tests was conducted,\n\nan optomechanical sensing scheme was selected.\n\nThe system is simple,\n\nboth electrically and mechanically, and it can be very rugged.\n\nIt consists\n\nof a light-emitting diode (L.E.D.), an optical shutter, and a phototransistor, as shown in Figure 16.\n\nAs the light vane is pushed down, a rec-\n\ntangular aperture opens permitting light to fall on the phototransistor.\nThe amount of light permitted to enter is directly proportional to the\ndeflection of the vane.\nThe compact design of the shutter linked to a circular sensing pad\non the surface of the end-effector is shown in Figure 17.\n\nA compliant\n\nwasher (or spring) between the body of the tongs and the sense pad conBy varying the compliance of the\n\nverts external force to deflection.\n\nwasher, the sensor can be adjusted to have full-scale output for applied\nweights from two grams to many kilograms.\n\nD.\n\nSelection of Actuators.\nThe survey of actuators for providing tactile stimulation to the\n\noperator\'s hand clearly suggested that rotary solenoids were best for\nthis application.\n\nA bench-top design with rotary actuators and push-button\n\nstimulators is currently being used to develop tactile stimulators for\nboth the high- and low-resolution systems.\n\nAnother viable possibility\n\nbeing considered is that of using miniature torque motors with a rotaryto-linear displacement converter.\n\nA particular problem at this stage is\n\nthe design of the push-rod mechanism that couples actuators and pushbuttons.\n\n27\n\nMOVEABLE\nLIGHT\nVANE\n\nPHOTOTRANSISTOR\n\nLED\n\nMOUNTING BLOCK\n\nRETAINING\nPIN\n\nAPERTURE\nPLATE\n\nMOUNTING BLOCK\nSA-1942-2\n\nFIGURE\n\n16\n\nEXPLODED\n\nDRAWING\n\nOF SHUTTER\n\nFORCE\n\nPHOTOTRANSISTOR\n\nLED\nMOUNTING BLOCK\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-PIN\n\nSA-1942-3\n\nFIGURE 17\n\nE.\n\nCROSS SECTION OF SENSOR WITH COMPACT SHUTTER\n\nHand Design\nTo experiment with and evaluate touch sensors in a working control\n\nsystem, an end-effector has been designed and partially constructed.\nThe end-effector consists of drive motor, housing, and links to support\nand control the sensorized tongs designed for the Navy hand. 3\n\nPrelim-\n\ninary measurements indicate that the sustained gripping force is 20 pounds\nand that the time to close the hand from an open position is 0.5 second.\nThe speed and force characteristics were chosen to match the tongs to\nthe NASA-Ames arm.\n\nEven higher opening and closing speeds may be neces-\n\nsary to allow the operator to effectively sense and control touch information fed back to him.\nDuring the next quarter the hand should be completed, and we will\nmake available a full description complete with a series of photos and\nsketches.\n29\n\nVII\n\nINFRARED POSITION SENSOR\n\nDuring this quarter we have built a set of circuits to drive the\nsensor described in Appendix A of Reference 1 for bench-top testing.\nThe circuitry is undergoing change and will be described at a later\ndate.\n\nExperiments with the system include determination of (1) optimum\n\nfocus and maximum strength of the light beams and (2) optimum focus and\nmaximum receptivity of the phototransistor "eyes."\nIn order to make these measurements, we mounted the infrared position sensor on one edge of an XY plotter table.\n\nThe movable carriage\n\nused a raster scan to search the area in front of the sensor.\n\nBy mount-\n\ning a light sensor or emitter on the movable carriage and controlling\nthe up-down position of the pen from the detector output, we plotted\nfield strengths.\nAn example of such a field-strength plot is given in Figure 18.\nHere a phototransistor with a small window (1-mm diameter) was swept\nslowly through the field on a raster scan.\n\nThe period of the vertical\n\nsweep is about 10 seconds,and that of the horizontal sweep is about 10\nminutes.\n\nThe plot of Figure 18 reveals that two side lobes (not designed\n\ninto the light-emitting system) are present at the top of the picture,\nand that the image plane of the light emitters is 2.2 inches in front of\nthe sensor housing.\n\nUsing these procedures it should be possible to map\n\nand control the receptive areas of the position sensor for best use in\nmanipulation tasks.\n\n30\n\nTHRESHOLD\n\noj\n\n=2 VOLTS\n\nVOLT\nTHRESHOLD - I\n\nF\n\nioltill\nI~ll\n,0tl/it,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nl\n\nSA-2583-10\n\nFIGURE 18\n\nFIELD STRENGTH PATTERN OF INFRARED LIGHT SOURCES\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nJ.
