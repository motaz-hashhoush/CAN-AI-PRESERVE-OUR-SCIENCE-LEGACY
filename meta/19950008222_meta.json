They have worked with other industry representatives and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to prepare a comprehensive plan to eliminate all ozone depleting chemicals from manufacturing processes and to reduce the use of other hazardous materials used to produce the space shuttle reusable solid rocket motors. The team used a classical approach for problem solving combined with a creative synthesis of new approaches to attack this problem. As our ability to gather data on the state of the Earth's environmental health increases, environmentally sound manufacturing must become an integral part of the business decision making process.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950008222, "id": "31a205117f2c44da95dee1980b10560d", "publicationName": "Huntsville Association of Technical Societies, TABES 1994: 10th Annual Technical and Business Exhibition and Symposium", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19950008206, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The Telecommunications and Data Acquisition Report", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950008222.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950008222/downloads/19950008222.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950008222/downloads/19950008222.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950008222/downloads/19950008222.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
