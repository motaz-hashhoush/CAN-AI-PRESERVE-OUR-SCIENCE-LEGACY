A mesh has to be generated for the valve for each position and compounding. The problem is the fact that the valve is typically part of a larger feedline system. In this paper, we propose to develop a system to create meshes for feedline systems with parametrically controlled valve openings. Herein we outline two approaches to generate the meshes for a valve in a feedline system at multiple positions. There are two issues that must be addressed. The first is the creation of the mesh on the valve for multiple positions. The second is the generation of the mesh for the total feedline system including the valve. For generation of the mesh on the valve, we will describe the use of topology matching and mesh generation parameter transfer. For generation of the total feedline system, we will describe two solutions that we have implemented. In both cases the valve is treated as a component in the feedline system. In the first method the geometry of the valve in the feedline system is replaced with a valve at a different opening position. Geometry is created to connect the valve to the feedline system. Then topology for the valve is created and the portion of the topology for the valve is topology matched to the standard valve in a different position. The mesh generation parameters are transferred and then the volume mesh for the whole feedline system is generated. The second method enables the user to generate the volume mesh on the valve in multiple open positions external to the feedline system, to insert it into the volume mesh of the feedline system, and to reduce the amount of computer time required for mesh generation because only two small volume meshes connecting the valve to the feedline mesh need to be updated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100004839, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "4ce29cfa99a543319bbc846de2008bdd", "id": "06de058c5ce54118b99abb9f261ae477"}], "name": "48th AIAA Aerosciences Meeting", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "4ce29cfa99a543319bbc846de2008bdd"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100004839, "id": "1928d053cc734379b2ab795246571684", "publicationDate": "2010-01-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100004839.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100004839/downloads/20100004839.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100004839/downloads/20100004839.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100004839/downloads/20100004839.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
