Each subassembly comprises a set of latching\npawls (29) which are driven into latching and unlatching positions relative to a grappled payload by a pair of\ngearmotors (40), each equipped with a ratchet clutch\ndrive mechanism (75, 76) which is two-fault tolerant\nwith respect to latching such that only one gearmotor\nof the four needs to be operational to effect a latch of\nthe payload but is single fault tolerant with respect to\nrelease of a latched payload. Sensors (72,92,96) are\nincluded for automatically sensing the magnetic grappling of a payload and for automatically de-energizing\nthe gearmotors (40) of the latching subassemblies when\na latch condition is achieved.\n6 Claims, 10 Drawing Sheets\n\nF.

Redundancies of many components are necesthat safety is not\nsary to\nin the\nOf system Or component\nand to\nsure mission success. Payload handling in the deployment and retrieval of a payload during an on-orbit operation is usually accomplished by means of an end effector affixed to the manipulator arm of a remote manipulator system typically mounted in the cargo bay of the\nvehicle. A potentially unsafe situation occurs when the\nmanipulator arm grapples a payload which is\nAny failure in the grapattached to the orbiter\npiing mechanisms of the remote manipulator system or\nthe payload docking fixture which prevents a release of\nthe payload would keep the manipulator arm protruding outside the cargo bay envelope and prevent the\nclosing of the cargo bay doors. The extra-vehicular\nactivity of an astronaut to attempt the manual release of\na stuck and effector or payload is generally undesirable\nbecause of the many associated perils and the costs\ninvolved.\nHeretofore, the various latching apparatuses and systerns for the retention of a payload in the cargo bay of\na space vehicle have been complex mechanical systems\nwhich are not fault-tolerant in operation, such as a\nlatching apparatus as disclosed in U S . Pat. No.\n4,508.296. Similar complex mechanical apparatuses\nwith grappling and latching capabilities are shown in\nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,929,009 and 4,929,011.\n\n2o\n\nI5\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n2\n\ncoils. The electromagnets are tolerant of two power\nfailures without releasing the magnetically grappled\npayload.\nWhen powered on by a single panel nvitch. the electromagnets attract the payload against the force of a\nspring u.asher mounted about the periphery of the~base\n,\n~\n~\n~\nPlate of the Payload retention device and adapted to\nsupport the Payload t h e ~ o n .The movement of the\npayload towards the e l e C t m q n e t s trips a contact\nsensor mounted on the base plate for signaling when the\npayload is \xe2\x80\x9cseated\xe2\x80\x9d and grappled. The contact sensor\nautomatically switches off the energizing circuits for\nthe pull-in coils while the holding coils remain in the\n\xe2\x80\x9cON\xe2\x80\x9d condition.\nWith the payload \xe2\x80\x9cseated\xe2\x80\x9d and magnetically grappled, the astronaut can then operate the motor-driven\nmechanical latch assembly for latching the payload\nduring non-use periods and during launch and landing\noperations with the electromagnets normally turned off\nduring such periods. The electromechanical latch assembly comprises two independent latching sub-spsterns, each of which comprises a cam ring gear and two\ngear motors for driving the associated cam ring gear in\nrotation about its central axis, ~\nl in each latching\n~\n~\n,\nsubsystem, latching pawls are mounted in equiangular\nspacing about the periphery of its cam-ring gear in\ncamming engagement therewith whereby camming\nsurfaces of the cam ring gear are adapted to drive the\npawls outwardly ofthe cam ring gear to the unlatching\nposition and also to control movement of the pawls\ninwardly to the latching position wherein the pawls\nengage and latch the payload. The cam ring gears of the\ntwo electromechanical latching subsystems are of equal\ndiameter and are mounted to the base plate at the top Of\nthe housing of the payload retention device in concentric relation thereon. The pawls of each latching subsystem are located intermediate the pawls of the other\nlatching subsystem and in the latching condition, the\nPaWls of both subsystems hold onto an annular lip provided On the payload.\nThe gearmotors are equipped with ratchet drives and\nclutch overrides to drive the cam ring gears in only one\ndirection of rotation. By means of the override, if one\nFarmotor in a subsystem should fail, the 0 t h motor\nwill drive its cam ring gear. The electromechanical\nlatching assembly of the invention is therefore two fault\ntOkrant on effecting a Capture by latching Since it is\nonly necessary the cam ring gear of one subassembly be\nmovable to effect a latching condition thereby requiring\nonly that one gearmotor be operative. However, the\nlatching assembly is single fault tolerant on release since\nboth cam nng gears must be movable to release all\nlatching pawls. In addition, optical sensors are provided\nfor indicating a latched or unlatched condition of the\npawls, from which indication the astronaut operator\nmay elect to de-energize the holding coils.\n\nSUMMARY OF T H E INVENTION\nThe present invention is a payload retention device\nfor the carrying and temporary storage of a payload in\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F THE DRAWINGS\na space vehicle.

It is important, however, that the payload be\nequipped with a ferrous strike plate or base member\nsuch as the circular base member 20 of the payload 14 in\nFIG. 1 and that it be equipped with a pair of alignment\npins. Accordingly, a disc-like base member of ferrous\nmaterial which is equipped with alignment pins such as\nD E T A I L E D DESCRIPTION OF T H E\nbase 20 and pins 21,22 is required to be mounted by\nINVENTION\n50 bolting, welding or the like as a fixture to any payload\nReferring more ParticUlarlY to the drawings, there is\nto be grappled and retained by the payload retention\ndevice 10.\nshown in FIG. 1, a payload retention device 10 representing a preferred embodiment of the invention which\nThe base plate 25 of the device 10 is preferably of\nis approached by the manipulator arm 12 of a remote\nlight weight material, such as aluminum, and in addition\nmanipulator system to which a payload 14 is attached. 5 5 to the holes or sockets 23,24 is provided with four equal\nThe payload 14 is represented by an electromagnetic\nsized rectangular openings 28 located at the four corattachment mechanism which, by operation of the reners of a square area which encloses the mirrored surmote manipulator system, may be guided and controlled\nface and the cross hair lines 27.

The electromagnets, one of which is illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4,\nare adapted by their pole pieces to exert a magnetic\nattraction force On the ferrous grapple fixture\nto\na payload and to effect the engagementand grappling\nthereof when the\npins Of the grapple fixture\nare received in the sockets 23, 24 Of the payload\ntion device 10. The electromagnets are used when\nberthing a payload On the device loas when a payload\nis transferred from a remote manipulator system as\ndepicted in FIG. 1, or when deploying a payload from\nthe payload retention device 10 in the cargo bay to a\nmanipulator arm. In addition, the retention device 10\nincludes an electromechanical latching assembly, to be\nhereinafter described, which includes a plurality of\nlatchlng pawls 29 and is\nfor carrying launch\nand landing loads associated with a docked payload on\nthe device 10 during the launch and landing of the space\nvehicle.\nEach of the electromagnets\n3 0 ~ 3 0 comprises a\n,\n~\nU-shaped core 33 of magnetically soft material, such as\npermendur. and three separate coils wtoundthereabout,\nFor each electromagnet, one of the three coils is a high\npowered pull-in coil which produces an appreciable\nattractive force with a large air gap, and which is\nadapted to be automatically switched off after grapple\nhas been achieved. The other two are holding coils\neach producw,hich are similar low current coils,\ning sufficient magnetization to saturate the core and\nthus develop the full rated holding performance of the\nelectromagnetic retention system, The two holdi:.:\ncoils are connected to separate power sources for . .\ndundant operation, Once grapple is achieved and\npull-in coil is de-energized. the holding coils remain\nenergized to maintain the magnetomotive force. If one\nof the holding coils should fail, the other holding coil\nhas sufficient field intensity to hold the payload.\n'\nAs shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. an assembly of an electromagnet, such as electromagnet 30A, comprises the\nmagnet core 33 with end poles 31,32, a pull-in coil 34A,\n- and a pair of holding coils 35A, 36A. Each electromagnet is encased in a housing cover 37 which may be\nfastened to the base plate 25 by means of bolts 39\nthrough bolt holes provided in the cover 37.\nWhen the astronaut operator has maneuvered the\nmanipulator arm 12 in proximity to the payload retention device, the operator will then throw a switch S W l\nlocated on a switch panel in the ORBITER spacecraft.\nClosing of the switch SWl, shown in the diagram in\nFIG. 5, activates control circuit No. 3 which includes\nthe holding coils 36A, 36B of the electromagnets 30A,\n30B respectively. The circuit No. 3 serves as a back-up\nto a control circuit No. 1 and a control circuit No. 2.\nCircuit No. 1, shown in block diagram in FIG. 6, con-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n3o\n\n35\n\n40\n\n81Al\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n6\n\ntrols the energizing and de-energizing of the pull-in coil\n34A and holding coil 35A of electromagnet 30A\nwhereas control circuit No. 2 controls pull-in coil 34B\nand holding coil 35B of the electromagnet 30B.\nThe pull-in coils of the electromagnets are used primarily in a berthing operation, as when a payload carried on the end of a manipulator arm 12 1s transferred to\nthe payload retention device 10 for temporary retention\nand stowage. In a typical berthing procedure, the operator, by use ofthe targeting and alignment system pre\\tiously described, aligns the manipulator arm 12 with the\npayload retention device 10 and closes the range with\nthe manipulator arm 12 to where a grapple and capture\nof the payload is possible. The operator then energizes\nthe pull-in coils of both electromagnets by closing\nswitches sw2 and sw3 on the switch panel in the ORBITER which close circuit breaker switches, 79, 80.\nrespectively, to connect additional power Sources PSI\nand pS2 in the ORBITER to the control circuits No, 1\nand No, 2, as will be noted by reference to FIG. 5. As\nshown therein, the power\npS1 is connected\nby means of a conductor 81 with the control circuit No.\n1 and also to the back-up\ncircuit No, 3 by a\nconductor 81A which is coupled to conductor 81. The\npower source PS2 is connected by a conductor 82 with\ncontrol circuit No. 2 and also to the back-up control\ncircuit No. 3 by a conductor 82A which is coupled to\nconductor 82'\nIn control circuit No. 1. shown in FIG. 6, the pull-in\ncoil 34.4 and holding coil 35.4 of electromagnet 30A are\nconnected in parallel\nconductor 81 and\nground. When power is applied to control circuit No. 1\nby closure of the switch s w 2 . coils 34A and 35A of\nelectromagnet 30A are simultaneously energized. In\ncontrol circuit No. 2 the pull-in coil 34B and one holding Coil 35B of electromagnet 30B are connected in\nParallel between conductor 82 and ground and are simultaneously energized by closure of the switch SW3.\nto be noted that power\nto\nIt is\ncircuits NO. 1 and NO. 2 is also delivered t O the back-up\ncontrol circuit No. 3 and the other two holding coils\n36.4, 36B included therein by means of the conductors\n82A respectively.\nWith reference to the diagram Of control circuits,\nFIG. 7, it will further be seen that the power applied to\ncontrol circuit NO. 3 through conductor 81A is applied\nto one end of 83, which has one input terminal coupled\nto the Power conductor 81A. The power applied to\ncontrol circuit NO. 3 through conductor 82A is delivered to holding coil 36B of electromagnet 30B through\nan OR gate 84 which has one input terminal coupled to\nthe power conductor 82.4. The other ends of the two\nholding coils 36A, 36B are at electrical ground.\nControl circuit No. 3 also includes a holding coil\nON/OFF circuit 85 which is connected at its output\nterminal to the holding coil 36A and at its input terminal\nto conductor 77 and the power source PS3. The power\nsource PS3 is also connected by conductor 77 to the\ninput terminal of a second holding coil ON/OFF circuit\n86 which connects at its output to the holding coil 36B.\nThe ON/OFF circuits 85,86 are in O F F condition until\nturned on at the same time power is delivered to the\ncontrol circuits NO. 1 and No. 2 and to control circuit\nNo. 3 by the power conductors 81A, 82A which are\ncoupled to second input terminals of the ON/OFF\ncircuits 85. 86, respectively. It will therefore be noted\nthat there are two power sources which energize each\n\n7\n\n5,125,601\n\nof the holding coils 36A. 36B of the electromagnets\n30A. 30B, respectively.\nIn control circuit No. 1, the holding coil 35A of electromqnet 30A is connected at one end to the power\nconductor 81 and to ground potential at the other end.\nThe pull-in coil 34A which also connects the power\nconductor 81 is coupled to ground through a pull-in coil\nON/OFF circuit 87 which is turned on as power is\napplied to the control circuit No. I through conductor\n81. A battery pack 89A, comprising two 9 volt alkaline\nbatteries connected in cascade to deliver 18 volts, is also\nconnected to the conductor 81 through a diode 90\nwhich blocks current flow to the battery pack from the\nconductor 81. The battery pack 89A is connected to\ngrourld through an ON/OFF circuit 91. When the pullin coil 34A is energized, the battery ON/OFF circuit 91\nis OFF.\nAs previously noted, the pull-in coils when energized. exert a strong attractive force for effecting a\ngrapple. When the pole faces of the electromagnets\n30A. 30B are in flush contact with the base plate on the\npayload, the pull-in coils 34A. 34B are automatically\nde-energized by an electrical signal from contact sensor\n92 in the control circuits Nos. 1 and 2, respectively. The\nsensor 92. mounted on the base plate 25, is a contact\nsnitch which detects the flush contact of the ferrous\nstrike plate 20 on the payload with the payload retention device 10 and the compression of the spring washer\n26. In control circuit No. 1 the contact sensor signal is\ncoupled to an input terminal of an OR gate 93. the\noutput of which is coupled to the pull-in coil ON/OFF\ncircuit 87 to turn this circuit O F F and de-energize the\npull-in coil. Its operation in control circuit No. 2 is\nidentical. It will thus be seen that the payload is then\nheld by the attractive force of the four holding coils in\nthe two electromagnets, each holding coil of which\nproduces sufficient magnetization to saturate the core of\nits associated magnet.\nAs a precaution in the event an operator should leave\nthe pull-in coil 34A energized for a relatively long time,\ninadvertent or otherwise, without effecting a grapple,\nthe resultant overheating of the pull-in coil will cause a\nhigh temperature sensor 94 coupled between the conductor 91 and OR gate 93 to transmit a signal to the\npull-in coil ON/OFF circuit 87 through the OR gate 93.\nwhich turns the circuit 87 OFF and de-energizes the\npull-in coil. In addition, a visual display 95 of light\nemitting diodes coupled to the contact sensor 92 and\nconductor 81 is also activated by an output signal from\nthe contact sensor 92 to indicate when contact has been\naccomplished. An optical sensor 96, also an optical\nswitch, is connected in parallel with the contact sensor\n92 and is adapted to signal a visual display 97 of light\nemitting diodes when the latching pawls are in their\nlatching condition and the payload is securely latched.\nIf desired, an optical sensor, such as sensor 96, might be\nmounted adjacent each pawl in a manner to be hereinafter described.\nThe control circuit No. 2 which controls electromagnet 30B includes similar components and sensors which\nfunction in the same manner as described in the operation of control circuit No. 1 for energizing and de-energizing pull-in coil 34B. Likewise, the description herein\nof other components and their operation in control\ncircuit No. 1 is equally applicable to control circuit No.\n2 which includes similar components.\nIn control circuit No. 1 voltage sensing circuit 98\nconnected between the conductor 81 and ground con-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n8\n\ntinuousl!, monitors the po\\ver supply Laoltage. The voltage sensing circuit 98 is provided with t\\vo output terminals, one of \\vhich is connected directly to a visual\ndisplay 99 of light emitting diodes and supplies a signal\nto maintain the display in a steady state when the power\nsupply is at a normal level. A second output terminal of\nthe voltage sensing circuit 88 is coupled to the visual\ndisplay 99 through an OR gate 100 and provides a signal\nthereto which flashes the display 99 whenever the\nsensed voltage drops below a predetermined level.\nWhen the pull-in coil 34A is de-energized by the\ncontact sensor, this condition is signaled to the battery\nON/OFF circuit 91 through an OR gale 101 which is\ncoupled between the ON/OFF circuit 91 and the low\nvoltage end of the pull-in coil. Although the battery\nON/OFF circuit 91 comes on instantly, the batteries\n89A do not discharge through the diode 90 since the\nvoltage at the pull-in coil 34A is higher than the battery\nvoltage. However, the battery pack will discharge current through the diode 90 if the power supply PSI\nshould fail or drop below 18 volts.\nAlso included in control circuit No. 1 is a ground\nsensing circuit 102 which is coupled betw3eenthe power\nconductor 81 and the battery ON/OFF circuit 91\nthrough the OR gate 101. The ground sensing circait\n102 signals the battery O W O F F circuit 91 to turn the\nbattery pack off when the astronaut operator switches\nthe ORBITER vehicle power supply PSI to ground\nand intentionally removes power from the control circuit.\nIt is to be understood that the control circuit No. 2,\nwhich controls the electromagnet 30B, is otherwise\nidentical to control circuit No. 1. and includes a similar\nvoltage sensing circuit for monitoring power supply\nvoltage, a similar ground sensing circuit, and its own\nreserve battery pack 89B.\nIt will therefore be seen that the electromagnetic\nretention system disclosed herein is two fault tolerant in\nboth grapple and release. The electromagnet retention\nsystem utilizes two electromagnets, each with a pull-in\ncoil and two holding coils with all coils being provided\nwith an available back-up power source. The pull-in\ncoils, which are energized to overcome the air gap to\nthe payload target, are also automatically de-energized\nimmediately after grapple to reduce the overall coil\nheat dissipation. However. it is also possible for the\nelectromagnets to get too cold, particularly during periods of non-use, such that they will draw excessive current when first energized. T o minimize such effects, a\npair of heater \xe2\x80\x9cstrips\xe2\x80\x9d 97 are fastened to the magnet\nhousing 37 and included in a thermostat-controlled\ncircuit whereby the heaters are turned on at approximately 63\xe2\x80\x9d F. and are turned off at approximately 72\xe2\x80\x9d F.\nOnce the payload is \xe2\x80\x9cseated\xe2\x80\x9d and held on the base\nplate 25 by the holding coils, which condition is signaled to the astronaut operator, the operator can then\noperate the electromechanical latching assembly for\nmechanically securing the payload on the payload retention device 10. When a latched condition is achieved\nas indicated by the optical sensor 96 the operator may\nthen switch off the electromagnet grappling system.\nThe electromechanical latching assembly of the payload retention device 10 includes two independent\nlatching subsystems, each of which consists of three\nlatch pawls 29, two motors 40 with overriding clutches,\nand one cam ring/gear 42, arranged and operatively\nassociated as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. The cam ring\ngear 42 is supported on three guide spools 43, each of\n\n9\n\n5,125,601\n\nwhich is bolted to the underside of the base plate 25 by\nmeans of a shoulder bolt 4 as shown in FIG. 10. The\n4\nguide spools 43 are arranged in 120 degree equiangular\nspacing as shown in FIG. 9 and are disposed adjacent\nthe periphery of the cam ring gear 42. A pair of annular\ngroot'es 45 are formed in the upper and lower annular\nsurfaces of the cam ring gear 42 extending to its inner\nperirhery and each receiving one of the edges of the\nspool 43. such that the cam ring gear is supported on the\nspool and journaled for rotation about its central axis.\nThe cam ring gear 42 is also provided with inner gear\nteeth 4 which are drivingly connected by pinion gears\n6\n48 to the drive shafts of the gearmotors 40 in a manner\nto be hereinafter described.\nEach of the latching pawls 29, as seen in FIG. 10,\nincludes an elongate shank portion 51 with a latching\nhook 52 on one end and a foot portion 53 at the other\nend. The pawl is mounted for pivotal mo\\'ement on a\npivot pin 50 which extends through an accommodating\nopening in the pawl at a location intermediate its shank\n51 and foot portion 53. The pawl box 55 is open at the\nside thereof which faces the cam ring gear 42 and includes an extension 56 which is secured to the underside\nof the base plate 25. The shank of the pawl extends\nthrough an over-sized opening 58 in the base plate 25\nadjacent the periphery of the base plate 25 and is oriented with its hook end 52 disposed towards the center\nof the cam ring gear 42. The pawl box 55 is also provided with a slot opening 59 in its bottom wall through\nwhich the foot portion 53 of the pawl extends. The\nopening 59 is over-sized with respect to the lateral\ncross-section of the foot portion 53 so as to accommodate a limited pivotal movement of the pawl.\nAt substantially the mid-point of its shank portion 51,\nthe pawl is fitted with a cam follower 60 which is secured to the shank by a screw 57 and includes a cam\nfollower surface 61 which faces the outer peripheral\nedge of the cam ring gear 42. The pawl 29 includes a\nheel portion 62 wrhich projects downwardly against an\nupwardly biased plunger 63 which seats atop a wave\nspring or coil spring 64 anchored in a lower corner of\nthe pawl box. Accordingly. the spring 64 applies a\ncounter-clockwise pivotal bias to the paw1 29 as viewed\nin FIG. 10 such that the cam follower 60 is in constant\nengagement with the cam ring gear 42. In addition, the\nlength of the pawl shank 51 is such that the hook 52 and\nits latching surface is spaced above the planar surface of\nthe base plate 25 to accommodate its latching engagement with the annular lip 65 which is provided about\nthe periphery of the base plate or strike plate secured as\na grapple fixture on the payload to be latched. As best\nseen in FIG. 10, the latch hook surface 52 extends\ndownwardly at an acute angle with respect to the shank\n5 1 and the lip 65 is provided with a conforming latching\nsurface 65A which extends upwardly towards the outer\nedge of the lip 65.\nIn the second latching subassembly of which the cam\nring gear is disposed in concentric relation with the cam\nring gear of the first latching subassembly but at a\ngreater distance from the base plate 25?the pawls 29 are\nof equal length with the pawls 29 of the other latching\nsubassembly and are identical thereto with the exception that the cam follower is secured to the pawl shank\nat a location closer to its pivot and thereby engages the\nperiphery of its associated cam ring gear.\nA switch box 66 is bolted to the outside of the lower\nwall of the pawl box 55 and includes an opening 67 in\nregistry with the slot opening 59 in the pawl box for\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n10\n\naccommodating the foot portion 53 of the pa\\sl. An\noptical swpitch 96 is mounted in the switch box 66 in a\nposition to indicate and verify when the pawl is in its\nlatching condition by detecting the pivotal position of\nthe pawl foot 53. The optical switch. of conventional\ntype, generates an electrical signal when the pa14.1 is in\nthe latched condition which activates ar. appropriate\nvisual indicator, such as the light-emitting-diode display\n97 shown in FIG. 6.\nAs best seen in FIGS. 8 and 9, the cam ring gear 42 of\neach independent latching subsystem is provided with\nthree camming surfaces 70, each of which extends\nthroughout an arc of approximately 70 degrees with\nrespect to the center of the cam ring gear and includes\na ramp surface of gradually increasing radial distance\nfrom the center of the cam ring gear. The three camming surfaces 70 are uniformly spaced and are separated\nby 50 degree arcuate portions of the cam ring gear, the\nexternal surfaces of which are at uniform radial distance\nfrom the center of the cam ring gear but of lesser radial\ndistance than the camming surfaces 70.\nIt will therefore be seen that when the magnets are\nenergized to unlatch the payload as seen in FIG. 12A,\nand as the cam ring gear is rotated in the clockwise\ndirection, by the motors 40, the cam followers 60 of\neach of the pawls will be moved outward as the followers engage the camming surfaces 70, thereby driving the\npawls in a pivotal movement counter to the biasing\nforce of the wave springs 64 such that the pawls begin\nto unlatch as shown in FIG. 12B and move to an unlatched condition as shown in FIG. 11.\nThree position switches 72 are also located about the\nperiphery of the cam ring gear 42 with their movable\nswitch elements disposed in engagement with the camming surfaces 70 when the cam ring gear and pawls are\nin their latch positions as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. In\nthis disposition, the switches 72 operate to transmit\nelectrical signals to shut off and cease the operation of\nthe gearmotors 40. For releasing a payload. the procedure is initiated by means of a panel switch (not shown)\nwherein the gearmotors of both latching subsystems can\nagain be activated by electrical signal to rotate their\ncam ring gears to the position wherein the pawls are\nmoved to the unlatched condition with their cam followers in engagement with the camming surfaces 70\nand the switching elements of the switches 72 engage\nthe portions of the peripheral surface of the cam ring\ngear which are of uniform and lesser radius. The gearmotors 40 may then again be activated to drive the cam\nring gear 42 until they are turned off by the position\nswitches 72 when the cam ring gear and pawls reach the\nlatched condition.\nTo achieve the latching condition, it is necessary that\nthe payload be maintained flush against the base plate 25\nby the electromagnetic retention system in order to\nallow the hook ends of the pawls to clear the upper\nedge of the lip 65 on the payload as it moves from a\nposition as seen in FIG. 11 towards the center of the\ncam ring gear to the position shown in FIG. 10. Once\nthis is achieved, the operator may then turn off the\nelectromagnets so that the spring washer 26 forces the\npayload and its lip 65 upwardly into latching engagement with the pawl hooks as in FIG. 12B.\nTo unlatch, the payload must again be drawn flush\nagainst the base plate 25 as in FIG. 12A by energizing\nthe electromagnets so that the latching pawls can clear\nthe annular lip 65 and move outwardly away from the\ncam ring gear.\n\n11\n\n5,125,601\n\nFor protecting the pau,ls and also serving as a structural support member, a ring flange 69 is provided atop\nthe base plate 25 about the periphery thereof and secured thereto by bolts or other means. As shoum in\nFIGS. 7 and 12. the flange is provided with a radial\ncross section of inverted generally \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d shape configuration and is also provided with six slots 69A formed in\nits upper and inner surfaces for accommodating the\npawls 29 and their pivotal movements.\nThe gearmotors 40 for driving the cam ring gear 42 in\na mechanical latching subsystem are two in number and\nare mounted to the base plate 25 in diametrically opposite positions with respect to the cam ring gear 42, as\nshown in FIGS. 8, 9 and 13. Each gearmotor 40 is secured by bolts 69 to a bracket 71 which is bolted to the\nelectromagnet housing 37. there being one such bracket\n71 for each gearmotor 40. A gearmotor 40 and details of\nthe ratchet drive mechanism provided therefor are\nshown in FIG. 15.\nT h s drive shaft 40A of the gearmotor 40 is fitted with\na coupling member 73, shown in detail in FIGS. 17A,\n17B. The coupling 73 is provided with a central axial\nopening 74 of hexagonal configuration in radial cross\nsection in conformance with the radial cross section of\nthe drive shaft 40A about which it is closely fitted in\nslee\\ -d relationship. It is also provided with diametrically opposed radially extending ears 73A. 73B.\nThe coupling 73 serves to couple the motor drive\nshafr 40A to a ratchet drive mechanism which comprises a lower ratchet member 75 and an upper ratchet\nmember 76, shown in sectional view in FIG. 16. The\nlower ratchet member 75 is of circular cylinder configuration which is open at one end and closed at the other\nby a transverse member 78. except for a relatively small\ncentral opening formed in its closed end \\vhich accommodates the lower end portion of an alignment pin 100\nfor aligning the two ratchet members 75.76 in a manner\nto be hereinafter described. The lower ratchet member\n75 houses a coiled spring 101 which is sleeved about the\nmotor drive shaft 40A with one end of the spring seated\non the coupling 73 and its other end in abutting relation\nto the inner surface of the closed end 78 of the rarchet\n75. The lower ratchet is therefore biased by spring 101\ninto engagement with the upper ratchet member 76.\nThe cylindrical wall of the lower ratchet 75 is provided with two diametrically opposed slots 75A, 75B\nwhich extend from the open end of the ratchet cylinder\nin the longitudinal direction of the cylinder. The slots\n75A, 75B receive the two ears 73A. 73B respectively, of\nthe coupling 73 such that axial rotation of the coupling\n73 produces axial rotation of the lower ratchet 75.\nThe lower ratchet member 75 is provided with a\nplurality of teeth 103 formed on the upper circular edge\nof an annular member 104 which is attached to the\nexterior of the closed end 78 in concentric relation\nthereto. The upper ratchet member 76, shown in sectional view in FIG. 16, comprises an elongate shaft\nportion with external threads 105 formed at one end for\naccommodating threaded connection with a pinion gear\n4 and an end nut 106 for securing the pinion gear. At its\n8\nother end, the upper ratchet member 76 is provided\nwith a plurality of teeth 107 which conform in configuration with the ratchet teeth of lower ratchet 75. The\nteeth of both ratchet members include vertically extending tooth edges as viewed in FIG. 15 which extend\nin the longitudinal direction of the ratchet members\nparallel to their axes. For all teeth in the lower ratchet\nmember 75, a sloping tooth edge also extends from the\n\n12\n\nlo\\ver end of a vertical tooth edge and rises upvardly to\nthe upper end of the next adjacent \\.ertical tooth edge to\nthe lrfr thereof. In the upper ratchet member. each\ntooth includes a sloping edge which extends down5 wardly from the top of its vertical tooih edge to the\nlower end of the vertical edge on the tooth to its right\nas viewed in FIG. 15. It will therefore be seen. that\nwhen the ratchet teeth of the upper ratchet 76 are\nmeshed with the ratchet teeth of the lo\\ver ratchet 75,\n10 an axial rotation of the lower ratchet member in the\ndirection of rise of the sloping edges of its ratchet teeth.\nplaces its ratchet teeth in driving engagement with the\nupper ratchet teeth, thereby driving the upper ratchet\nmember 76 and its pinion gear 48 in the clockwise direc15 tion of axial rotation as seen in FIG. 9. The cam ring\ngear 42 which is engaged by the pinion gear 48 is also\ndriven in the same clockwise direction.\nThe upper ratchet member 76 is also provided with a\nblind axial bore 76A which extends from the toothed\n20 end of the ratchet member 76 and is adapted to snugly\nreceive the upper end portion of the alignment pin 100\nas shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. The lower end portion of\nthe alignment pin 100 extends through the opening 78A\nin the closed end 78 of the lower ratchet member 75.\n2 5 Preferably, an annular flange 102 is provided for the pin\n100 which abuts a downward facing shoulder 76B of the\nratchet member 76 as provided by an enlarged diameter\nportion of the bore 76A. It will thus be seen that the\nratchet members 75, 76 are retained in axial alignment\n30 by the alignment pin 100.\nIt is also to be noted that if either one of the two\ngearmotors in a mechanical latching subsystem should\nfail, the other gearmotor will continue to drive the cam\nring gear 42 in its clockwise direction of rotation by\n35 virtue of the clutch override provided by the yielding\nconnection of the two ratchet members as described\nabove. In the event of a failure of one gearmotor which\nprecludes axial rotation of the lower ratchet member 75,\nthe continued operation of the other gearmotor will\n40 continue to drive the cam ring gear 42 and also the\n\xe2\x80\x99 pinion gear 48 which is operably connected to the failed\npearmotor. thereby continuing the axial rotarion of the\nupper ratchet member 76 which is permitted by the\nupper ratchet teeth riding over the teeth of the lower\n45 ratchet member 75. The override is possible because the\nupper ratchet teeth force the lower ratchet member 75\ndownwardly against the biasing force of the coiled\nspring 101 as is permitted by the slotted connection of\nthe coupling 73 with the lower ratchet member 75. In\n50 this respect. the slots 75A, 75B in the cylinder wall of\nratchet member 75 are designed with sufficient length\nto allow the override.\nIt will therefore be seen that in addition to a two fault\ntolerant magnetic retention system, the payload reten55 tion device 10 includes an electromechanical latching\nassembly which is two fault tolerant with respect to\nlatching a payload since it is only necessary that the cam\nring gear and pawls of one latching subassembly be\nmovable to the latching position, which condition can\n60 be achieved if only one gearmotor is operational. However, the electromechanical latching assembly is single\nfault tolerant with respect to release of a payload since\nrelease requires that both cam ring gears and all pawls\nof both latching subassemblies must be movable to the\n65 release position.\nIt will further be seen that the payload retention device of the present invention comprises an electromagnetic retention system for effecting the grapple of a\n\n13\n\n5.125.601\n,\n,\n\ntarget payload in combination Lvith an electromechanical latching assembly which is particularly useful in\nhandling the force loads imposed on a payload docked\nin the cargo bay of a space vehicle during the launch\nand landing phases of a space flight. The combination of 5\nmechanical latches and magnetic grappling is provided\nto ensure there are no failures as would cause an unsafe\ncondition. The systems for magnetic grappling and\nmechanical hold-down are independent and the electromagnets can be energized at any time power is avail- 10\nable.\nIt is also to be understood that the foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has\nbeen presented for purposes of illustration and explanation and is not intended to limit the invention to the 15\nprecise form disclosed. For example, the number of\nelectromagnets in the electromagnetic retention system\nand the number of coils on the electromagnets themselves could be other than described. Also, if desired a\nthird independent latching subassembly which provides 20\na third cam ring gear with additional pawls and gearmotors could be provided if greater fault tolerance is desired for latching capability. It is to be appreciated\ntherefore that various structural changes may be made\nby those skilled in the art without departing from the 25\ninvention.\nI claim:\n1.
