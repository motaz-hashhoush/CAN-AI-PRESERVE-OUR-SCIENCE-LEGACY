(1973; hereafter referred to as BHNBL) have determined\na radial diffusion coefficient D by making empirical fits to the observed\nA steady-state model of\n\n10.4-cm radiation from Jupiter (Berge, 1966).\nthe electron radiation belts was developed.\n\nThis model assumed injection\n\nof particles from the solar wind, radial diffusion, energy degradation\nby synchrotron radiation, and absorption at Jupiter\'s surface.\n\nA\n\ndiffusion coefficient of the form\n\n(1)\n\nD = k Rm\n\nwas assumed.\n\nThe following values of the parameters were in best\n\nagreement with the observations:\n\nk = 1.7 \xc2\xb1 0.5 x 10- 9 R\n\n2\n\n/sec\n\n(2)\n\nm = 1.95 \xc2\xb1 0.5\n1o\n\nwhere\n\n=\n\n770 MeV/Gauss\n\no is the (monoenergetic) magnetic moment at the time of injection.\n\nThese values of k and m are reasonably consistent with the atmospheric\ndynamo mechanism.\n\nLUNAR ABSORPTION MODEL\nIn this paper we estimate the absorption effects of the moons\nAmalthea (R = 2.55 R), Io (R = 5.95 R), Europa (R = 9.47 RJ),\n\nand\n\nGanymede (R = 15.1 Rj), by adding loss terms representing these satellites\nto the BHNBL electron transport equation!\n\nAs in BHNBL, n is the number of electrons with magnetic moments between\np and p + dp (p is in units of MeV/Gauss), with longitude invariants\nbetween 0 and AJ, contained in a (dipole) magnetic field flux tube which\ncrosses the jovimagnetic equatorial plane a distance R (in units of\nJovian radii) from the center of the planet and which has a cross-sectional\narea of R dR d4\n\nin that plane (d\n\nis an element of longitude).\n\nThe first\n\nterm on the left side is the radial diffusion term, the second term\nrepresents synchrotron energy loss, and the third term represents absorption\nby the satellites.\n\nThe source, located at Ro with the source strength N,\n\nis represented by the term on the right.\n\n(The position of the source,\n\nso long as it is further out than Ganymede, has no effect on the radial\nshape of n at R<15.1 Rj; we have taken Ro = 35 Rj.)\n\nThe four satellites,\n\ni = 1 to 4, are centered at distances Ri from the center of the planet\nand have radii a i .\n\nThe step function S(R-Ri\xc2\xb1ai)\n\nregion Ri - ai < R < Ri + a i and zero elsewhere.\n\nis unity over the\nThe average "lifetimes"\n\nTi depend on the electron energy and equatorial pitch angle as well as\nthe satellite by which the electron is being absorbed.\n\nImplicit in\n\nEquation 3 is the assumption that a single form of D is valid out to\nthe radius of Ganymede\'s orbit.\nAs in BHNBL, Equation (3) is solved by a numerical finite difference\ntechnique with the boundary conditions that n vanish at the surface of\nJupiter [n (R=l) =\n\nOl\n\nand at the magnetopause Jn(R=Rm) = O] and that the\n\nsole source of electrons be that shown explicitly on the right hand side\n(we thus demand that n(p > Vo) = 0 so that there is no flow of electrons\n\ninto the system through boundaries in u-space).\n\n6\n\nRESULTS\nEquation (3) has been solved for several different combinations of\nparameters.\n\nIn all cases we have taken po = 770 MeV/Gauss at injection.\n\nPopulations of electrons with p <1jo are formed, however, due to energy\nThe upper curve in Figure 1\n\ndegradation caused by synchrotron radiation.\n\nis a plot of the density of the highest-energy electrons (V = po ) vs.\nR for m = 1.95 and k = 1.7 x 10- 9 Rj2 /sec.\n\n(Electrons with 1 =po occur\n\nat radii other than the injection radius Ro because of the finite difference\nmethod of solution; cf. discussion in BHNBL.)\nThe lower curve of Figure 1 shows the effect of lunar absorption on\nelectrons with equatorial pitch angles everywhere less than 690 (mirror\nlatitudes greater than 100).\n\nThese electrons undergo Case 2 or snowplow\n\nabsorption (Mead and Hess, 1973).\n\nThat is, since their mirror latitude\n\nis always greater than the jovimagnetic latitude of the absorbing moon,\nand since the relative longitudinal motion with respect to the moon during\none\n\nbounce period is less than a lunar diameter, the characteristic\n\nabsorption time T. at each moon is roughly equal to the lunar corotation\n1\nperiod, i.e.,\n\nthe apparent (retrograde) period of revolution of each\n\nmoon in a frame of reference rotating with Jupiter\'s decametric rotation\nperiod (Mead and Hess, 1973).\n\nThe trapped particles are assumed to\n\ncorotate with the planet at least out to 16 Rj.\n\nThis lunar corotation\n\nperiod is 2.4 days at Amalthea, 0.54 days at Io, 0.47 days at Europa,\nand 0.44 days at Ganymede.\n\n7\n\nA significant absorption effect occurs at the positions of Io, Europa,\nand Ganymede (due to its tiny size, Amalthea exerts a negligible effect).\nThe effect is seen as a discontinuity in the slope of the electron\ndensity at each of the satellite positions, producing a downward-pointing\ncusp.\nDue to the 100 tilt of Jupiter\'s dipole with respect to its rotation\naxis, electrons with equatorial pitch angles greater than 590 will have\nlonger average absorption lifetimes at each satellite.\n\nThe Galilean\n\nsatellites oscillate between \xc2\xb1 100 jovimagnetic latitude in one corotation\nperiod, and low-latitude-mirroring particles are less likely to collide\nwith a satellite than are high-latitude-mirroring particles (Mead and\nHess, 1973).\n\nThe middle curve of Figure 1 shows the density of electrons\n\nwith an equatorial pitch angle of 870 (mirror latitude of 1.50) at\nR = 1.85 Rj, the heart of Jupiter\'s synchrotron radiation region.\n\nThese\n\nelectrons would contribute significantly to the emission observed at\nEarth.\n\nThe equatorial pitch angle varies from 870 to 84.90 in the\n\nregion out to 16 Rj under V and J conservation.\n\nThe absorption lifetimes\n\nfor a p = 770 MeV/Gauss electron as calculated from Equation 37 of\nMead and Hess (1973) are 25 days at Amalthea, 5.8 days at Io, 5.1 days\nat Europa, and 5.0 days at Ganymede.\n\nThe effects of absorption are\n\nclearly greatly reduced for these near-equatorial particles.\nThe effectiveness of each satellite in wiping out electrons which\nmirror at latitudes greater than 100 is also evident from the first\ncolumn of Table 1.\n\nThe reduction factor is the ratio of n at adjacent\n\npoints midway between satellites.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the satellites\n\n8\n\non these same electrons is seen from the second column of Table 2.\n\nThe\n\nratio listed here is the value of n without moons (upper curve of Fig. 1)\ndivided by n with moons (lower curve of Fig. 1) at the same R.\nThe error limits quoted in Equation (2) result from uncertainties\nin fitting the Berge (19E6) data.\n\nThe dependence of satellite wipe-out\n\non these uncertainties has been estimated by also solving Eq. (3) for\nhigh latitude mirroring electrons for the following pairs of m and k:\n9\n\nsec- 1\n\n1) m = 1.45, k = 1.7 x 10\n\nsec-1;\n\n3) m = 1.95,\n\nsec-1 ; and 4) m = 1.95, k = 2.2 x 10\n\nk = 1.2 x 10\n\n2)\n\nm = 2.45, k = 1.7 x 10\n\nResults for Cases 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 2.\nMeV/gauss) and low-I\' (1=0.48 MeV/gauss)\nare the m = 1.95 results without moons.)\n\nsec-I\n\nWe show both high-p (1=770\n\nelectrons.\n\n(The dotted curves\n\nUncertainties in n resulting\n\nfrom this m variation are of the order of a factor of 20 at each\nsatellite for the p = 770 MeV/gauss electrons.\nthe low-\n\nelectrons.\n\nThey are even larger for\n\nIn no way, however, do these uncertainties negate\n\nthe conclusion that the satellites are very effective in wiping out high\nlatitude mirroring electrons.\n\nUncertainties in n due to the k-variation\n\nare of the order of a factor of 2 at each satellite and hence considerably\nsmaller than those shown in Fig. 2.\n\nValues of the reduction factor at\n\neach satellite for p = 770 MeV/gauss electrons are also listed in Table 1\nfor Cases 1-4.\nThe Galilean satellites can be similarly important in limiting the\nfluxes of energetic protons.\n\nWe have studied this effect by solving\n\nEq. (1) with the synchrotron energy loss term eliminated.\n\n(Because of\n\ntheir mass, protons are far poorer synchrotron radiation emitters than\nare electrons of the same p.)\n\nThe values of\n\npo and D were taken to be\n\nthe same as were determined for the electrons.\n\nFigure 3 shows the results\n\nfor protons mirroring at latitudes greater than 100.\nthese particles\n\nThe lifetimes of\n\n(0.14 days at Amalthea,0.28 days at Io,0.38 days at\n\nEuropa, 1.13 days at Ganymede)\n\nwere calculated in the same way as for\n\nelectrons, the one difference being that proton energies close in to\nJupiter\'s surface are so large that gradient-curvature drifts strongly\ndominate co-rotational ExB motions.\n\nShown for comparison is the\n\nlower electron curve of Fig. 1.\nThe generally greater effectiveness of the satellites in removing\nprotons, as seen in Fig. 3 and Tables 1 and 2, results from the shorter\nabsorption lifetimes of protons.\n\nThe precipitous fall-off of the electron\n\ndensity inside of Io is partly the strong effect of electron synchrotron\nenergy loss in this region.\n\nThe cumulative effect of the satellites is\n\nto reduce the proton density near R = 2 by a factor of 3.2 x 106 from\nwhat it would be without moons.\n\nDISCUSSION\nBecause the Galilean satellites have such a large effect on the\nelectron density, it is legitimate to question the use of m = 1.95 and\nk = 1.7 x 10\n\n9\n\nsec-1 which were obtained by BHNBL without considering\n\nsatellite absorption.\n\nWe have repeated the synchrotron calculation of\n\nBHNBL with these same values of m and k and with satellite absorption\nincluded in the electron transport equation.\n\nWe find that the fit to\n\n10\n\nthe observed radial profile of synchrotron radiation is only slightly\npoorer with satellite absorption than without:\n\nthe RMS residual U is\n(For the same\n\n0.0049 with satellites and0.0027 without satellites.\n\ninjection strength, the intensity of sychrotron radiation is, however,\norders of magnitude weaker with satellites than without.)\ntherefore continued to use m = 1.95, k = 1.7 x 10\n\n-9\n\nsec\n\nWe have\n\n-1\n\nThe large density drops in electrons and protons at Ganymede,\nEuropa, and Io should manifest themselves in corresponding flux reductions\nas observed by satellites traversing Jupiter\'s magnetosphere.\nF (E, Q) of particles differential in total energy E = ymoc\n\n4\n\nThe flux\nand solid\n\nangle Q is related to n by (Northrop and Teller, 1960)\n\n(E2 - mo 24 ) n R 2\nc\n\nF=\n\nr mo c 2\n\n(4)\n\nao\n\nat a near-equatorial point R in the field of a dipole of strength ao.\n\nIn\n\ncrossing the orbits of Ganymede, Europa, and Io, F in Eq. 4 is most critically affected by the change in n.\nThe fluxes of protons and high energy electrons ought to exhibit\nthe behavior of n as shown in Figures (1-3) with a downward pointing cusp\n(indicating a discontinuity in an/DR) at the position of each of the\nthree effective satellites.\n\nThe drop in flux should be most pronounced\n\nat jovimagnetic latitudes >100 because (cf. Fig. 1) particles mirroring\nnear the magnetic equator have a greater chance of escaping absorption\nthan do those mirroring at higher magnetic latitudes.\n\n11\n\nOur conclusions are based on the simplest model of Jupiter\'s magnetosphere containing what we consider the essential physics.\n\nThe possible\n\nfailure of spacecraft to see the flux jumps which we predict would\nindicate to us that one or more of our premises are in error:\n\n1) the\n\nGalilean satellites may be sufficiently conducting that field distortions\nallow particles to slip around and past moons rather than impact them;\n2) the form of D obtained by BHNBL in the 1-4 Rj region may be invalid at\nthe larger R positions of the satellites; or 3) the source of energetic\ncharged particles may not be the solar wind but local acceleration in the\nvicinity of one or more of the satellites themselves (Hubbard et al., 1973).\nThe era of active exploration of Jupiter\'s magnetosphere which is\nnow beginning should answer the question of the correctness of our model.\n\nREFERENCES\nBerge, G.
