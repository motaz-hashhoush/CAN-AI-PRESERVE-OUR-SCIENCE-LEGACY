A definition of a tethered constellation is any number of masses/platforms greater that two connected by tethers in a stable configuration. Configurations and stability constraints are reviewed. Conclusions reached are: (1) The 1-D, horizontal, passively stabilized constellations have been ruled out; (2) Fishbone constellations have been also ruled out; (3) Alternative stable 2-D configurations have been devised such as the quadrangular configuration stabilized by electrodynamic forces (ESC), the quadrangular configuration stabilized by differential air drag (DSC), and the pseudo elliptical configuration stabilized by electrodynamic forces (PEC). Typical dimensions for these constellations are 10 km (horizontal) by 20 km (vertical) with balloon diameters around 100 m in the case of a DSC and a power consumption around 7 KW for an ESC or PEC.", "title": "Tethered constellations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860018949, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lorenzini, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "71f0dce468cf484f8b2ff67b0a5d6bfb"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860018949, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860018949, "publisher": "Pergammon Press Ltd.", "id": "5a1d8f42463240ed91a3162cc5a63235", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington Applications of Tethers in Space: Workshop Proceedings, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1986-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19860018935, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Applications of Tethers in Space: Workshop Proceedings, Volume 1", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860018949.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860018949/downloads/19860018949.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860018949/downloads/19860018949.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860018949/downloads/19860018949.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
