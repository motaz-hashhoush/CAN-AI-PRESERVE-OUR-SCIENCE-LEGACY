The multiline representation includes a principal term and terms of minor significance. The principal term is the equivalent width of the molecular band consisting of the same n nonoverlapping spectral lines. The terms of minor significance take into consideration the overlapping of two, three and more spectral lines. They are small in case of the weak overlapping of spectral lines in the molecular band. The multiline representation can be easily generalized for optically inhomogeneous gas media and holds true for combinations of molecular bands. If the band lines overlap weakly the standard formulation of line-by-line method becomes too labor-consuming. In this case the multiline representation permits line-by-line calculations to be performed more effectively. Other useful properties of the multiline representation are pointed out.", "title": "A new mathematical formulation of the line-by-line method in case of weak line overlapping", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950004256, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ishov, Alexander G."}, "organization": {"name": "Institute of Experimental Meteorology", "location": "Obninsk, Ussr"}}, "id": "14ef931ba1ac4fee9c94a5fc602f60c8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950004256, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Krymova, Natalie V."}, "organization": {"name": "Institute of Experimental Meteorology", "location": "Obninsk, Ussr"}}, "id": "0958a5ac5f2044ce89e496abb2617bb6"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950004256, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950004256, "id": "1ff578fa14f84f5aaec49c49f664ebf2", "publicationName": "NASA.
