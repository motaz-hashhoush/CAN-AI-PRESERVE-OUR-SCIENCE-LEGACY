Approaches  for automatically determining the range and shape of objects are discussed, giving attention to the automatic comparison of one scan line  of the left with one scan line of the right TV image. Methods of mapping binocular space into match space are considered together with the use of a model in match space, rules for processing random-dot stereograms, the elimination of spurious matches, random-square stereograms, questions of the processing of a real scene, and aspects of range  accuracy. Methods of computation for extracting other features are also discussed along with stereo TV cameras and approaches for reconstructing the appearance of a scene.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19730052519, "endDate": "1972-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "National Conference on Remotely manned systems: Exploration and operation in space", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "2ee5201edfa34edbb18c13f252858b15", "startDate": "1972-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730052519, "id": "1cd4a7ab380a43e8bd3f294c663f7758", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
