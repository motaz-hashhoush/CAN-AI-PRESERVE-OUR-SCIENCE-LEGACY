Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nAs an alternative to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at Glenn\nResearch Center have been fabricating\npackaging components and assembling\na set of unique probes that contain commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor chips. MEMS sensor chips offer\nsome compelling advantages over standard macroscopic measurement devices. MEMS sensor technology has matured through mass production and use\nin the automotive and aircraft industries. At present, MEMS are the devices\nof choice for sensors in such applications as tire-pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances.\nCompactness, minimality of power demand, rugged construction, and moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS\nsensors attractive for instrumentation\nfor future research.\nConventional macroscopic flow-measurement instrumentation includes\ntubes buried beneath the aerodynamic\nsurfaces of wind-tunnel models or in\nwind-tunnel walls. Pressure is introduced\nat the opening of each such tube. The\npressure must then travel along the tube\nbefore reaching a transducer that generates an electronic signal. The lengths of\nsuch tubes typically range from 20 ft (\xe2\x89\x88 6\nm) to hundreds of feet (of the order of\n100 m). The propagation of pressure signals in the tubes damps the signals con-\n\nThis Probe Containing Three COTS MEMS Sensor Chips is designed to measure flow angularity\nin a plane. A planned similar probe will contain\nfive MEMS sensors for measuring flow angularity in three dimensions.\n\nsiderably and makes it necessary to delay\nmeasurements until after test rigs have\nreached steady-state operation. In contrast, a MEMS pressure sensor that generates electronic output can take readings continuously under dynamic\nconditions in nearly real time.\nIn order to use stainless-steel tubing\nfor pressure measurements, it is necessary to clean many tubes, cut them to\nlength, carefully install them, delicately\ndeburr them, and splice them. A cluster\nof a few hundred 1/16-in.- (\xe2\x89\x881.6-mm-)\ndiameter tubes (such clusters are common in research testing facilities) can be\nseveral inches (of the order of 10 cm) in\ndiameter and could weigh enough that\ntwo technicians are needed to handle it.\nReplacing hard tubing with electronic\n\nchips can eliminate much of the bulk.\nEach sensor would fit on the tip of a\n1/16-in. tube with room to spare.\nThe Lucas NovaSensor P592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor was chosen for this project because of its cost,\navailability, and tolerance to extreme\nambient conditions. The sensor chip is\n1 mm square by 0.6 mm thick (about\n0.039 by 0.039 by 0.024 in.) and includes 0.12-mm (\xe2\x89\x880.005-in.) wire connection tabs.\nThe figure shows a flow-angularity\nprobe that was built by use of three such\nMEMS chips. It is planned to demonstrate this MEMS probe as an alternative\nto a standard tube-type \xe2\x80\x9cCobra\xe2\x80\x9d probe\nnow used routinely in wind tunnels and\naeronautical hardware. This MEMS\nprobe could be translated across a flow\nfield by use of a suitable actuator, so that\nits accuracy and the shortness of its response time could be exploited to obtain precise dynamic measurements of a\nsort that cannot be made by use of conventional tubing-based instrumentation.\nThis work was done by Chip Redding, Floyd\nA.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe figure depicts an apparatus that\nsimultaneously records magnified ordinary top-view video images and lasershadowgraph video images of a sessile\ndrop on a flat, horizontal substrate that\ncan be opaque or translucent and is at\nleast partially specularly reflective.

As in the case of the previously reported apparatus, the diameter, contact\nangle, and rate of evaporation of the\n\ndrop as functions of time can be calculated from the apparent diameters of\nthe drop in sequences of the images acquired at known time intervals, and the\nshadowgrams that contain flow patterns\nindicative of thermocapillary convection\n(if any) within the drop.

Charge-coupled-device (CCD)\ncamera 1 (with zoom) acquires the ordinary video images, while CCD camera 2\nacquires the shadowgrams. With respect\nto the portion of laser light specularly reflected from the substrate, the drop acts\nas a plano-convex lens, focusing the laser\nbeam to a shadowgram on the projection\nscreen in front of CCD camera 2.\nThe equations for calculating the diameter, contact angle, and rate of evaporation of the drop are readily derived\non the basis of Snell\xe2\x80\x99s law of refraction\nand the geometry of the optics. The\nequations differ from those for the apparatus of the cited prior article. Omitting intermediate steps of the derivation\nfor the sake of brevity, the results are the\nfollowing:\nThe two related unknown quantities are\nthe contact angle (\xce\xb8 ) and, for light that\nhas been reflected from the substrate, the\nangle of refraction (\xce\xb8 2) of that light from\n\n6\n\nthe surface of the drop at a point near\nedge.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn electronic instrument that could detect the potentially dangerous buildup of\nice on an airplane wing is undergoing development. The instrument is based on a\nmicrowave transmission line configured\nas a capacitance probe: at selected spots,\nthe transmission-line conductors are\npartly exposed to allow any ice and/or liquid water present at those spots to act as\npredominantly capacitive electrical loads\non the transmission line. These loads\nchange the input impedance of the transmission line, as measured at a suitable excitation frequency. Thus, it should be possible to infer the presence of ice and/or\nliquid water from measurements of the\ninput impedance and/or electrical parameters related to the input impedance.\nThe sensory transmission line is of the\nmicrostrip type and thus thin enough to\nbe placed on an airplane wing without unduly disturbing airflow in flight. The sensory spots are small areas from which the\nupper layer of the microstrip has been removed to allow any liquid water or ice on\nthe surface to reach the transmission line.\nThe sensory spots are spaced at nominal\nopen-circuit points, which are at intervals\nof a half wavelength (in the transmission\nline, not in air) at the excitation frequency. The excitation frequency used in\nthe experiments has been 1 GHz, for\nwhich a half wavelength in the transmission line is \xe2\x89\x884 in. (\xe2\x89\x8810 cm).\nThe figure depicts a laboratory prototype of the instrument. The impedancerelated quantities chosen for use in this\nversion of the instrument are the magnitude and phase of the scattering parameter S11 as manifested in the in-phase (I )\nand quadrature (Q) outputs of the phase\ndetector. By careful layout of the transmission line (including the half-wavelength sensor spacing), one can ensure\nthat the amplitude and phase of the\ninput to the phase detector keep shifting\n\nHalf\nWavelength\n\nHalf\nWavelength\nMicrowave Transmission\nLine (Stripline)\n\nSensory Spot\nLow-Loss Coaxial Cable\n\nSignal Source\n(1 GHz)\n\nAdjustable\nPhase Shifter\n\nPhase\nDetector\n\nI\n\nQ\n\nData-Acquisition Board\n(Including Analog-to-Digital\nConverters)\n\nPortable\nComputer\n\nPlots and Other\nResults of Analysis\n\nThe I and Q Outputs of the Phase Shifter are affected by the presence or absence of liquid water or\nice on the sensory spots on the microwave transmission line.\n\nin the same direction as ice forms on one\nor more of the sensor areas. Although\nonly one transmission-line sensor strip is\nused in the laboratory version, in a practical application, it could be desirable to\ninstall multiple strips on different areas\nto detect localized icing. In that case, a\nmultiplexer should be used to connect\nthe various strips to the phase detector\nfor sequential measurements.\nExperiments have been performed\nwith freezing and thawing of water and of\nwater/glycol mixtures. The experiments\nhave shown that, whether or not glycol is\npresent, it is possible to distinguish between liquid water and ice via the I and Q\noutputs; in particular, the equipment can\n\nbe adjusted so that when water freezes, I\ndecreases and Q increases. With respect\nto the operation of this instrument, the\nmain effect of glycol is to increase the\nfreezing or thawing time.\nThis work was done by G. Dickey Arndt\nand Phong Ngo of Johnson Space Center\nand James R. Carl of Lockheed Martin. For\nfurther information, contact G.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn apparatus for measuring the rate of\nflow and the mass density of a liquid or\nslurry includes a special section of pipe\ninstrumented with microwave and sonic\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nsensors, and a computer that processes\ndigitized readings taken by the sensors.\nThe apparatus was conceived specifically\nfor monitoring a flow of oil-well-drilling\n\nmud, but the basic principles of its design\nand operation are also applicable to monitoring flows of other liquids and slurries.\nIn one configuration, a special section\n\n7\n\nMicrowave Sensor\nSteppedFrequency\nTransmitter\n\nSteppedFrequency\nReceiver\nData\n\nComputer and\nSoftware\n\nDirectional\nCoupler\n\nPhase-Stable Coaxial Cable\nBroad-Band Antenna\n\nFluid in Pipe\n\nThe Height of the Fluid relative to the antenna is determined from differences between the phases of\nstepped-frequency microwave signals transmitted to, and reflected from, the top surface of the fluid.\n\nof pipe is located immediately upstream\nof the point of discharge of the flow to\nbe monitored. The special section of\npipe must be large enough that the pipe\ncan accommodate the entire flow of interest (in contradistinction to a small diverted sample flow), that the flow remains laminar at all times, and that the\npipe is never entirely full, even at the\nmaximum flow rate.\nIn another configuration, the apparatus does not measure the rate of flow or\nthe density directly: Instead, it (a) measures the height of the fluid in the special section of pipe and computes the\nflow rate as a predetermined function of\nthe height and (b) measures the speed\nof sound in the fluid and computes the\ndensity of the fluid as a predetermined\nfunction of the speed of sound in the\nfluid. To enable the apparatus to per-\n\nform these computations, one must calibrate the apparatus, prior to operation,\nby measuring the flow rate as a function\nof height and the mass density as a function of the speed of sound for the\ndrilling mud or other fluid of interest.\nIn the second configuration, the velocity of the fluid can be measured subsurface using a set of one transmitter and two\nreceivers to measure differential phase\nshifts. This second configuration can be\nused within a filled or unfilled closed pipe\nto measure volume flow. The microwave\nportion of the apparatus (see figure)\nincludes a broadband swept-frequency\n(more precisely, stepped-frequency)\ntransmitter/receiver pair connected, via\na directional coupler, to an antenna\naimed downward at the liquid. Transmitted- and received-signal data are processed\nby an algorithm that uses a modified\n\nFourier transform to compute the roundtrip propagation time of the signal reflected from top of the fluid. The height\nof the fluid is then computed from the\nround-trip travel time and the known\nheight of the antenna. A sonic sensor that\noperates alongside the microwave sensor\ngives an approximate height reading that\nmakes it possible to resolve the integermultiple-of-2\xcf\x80 phase ambiguity of the microwave sensor, while the microwave sensor makes it possible to refine the height\nmeasurement to within 0.1 in. (\xe2\x89\x882.5 mm).\nUltrasonic sensors on the walls near\nthe bottom of the special section of pipe\nare used to measure the speed of sound\nneeded to compute the density of the\nfluid. More specifically, what is measured\nis the difference between the phase of a\nsignal of known frequency at a transmitting transducer and the phase of the\nsame signal at a receiving transducer a\nknown distance away. It may also be necessary to resolve an integer-multiple-of2\xcf\x80 phase ambiguity. This can be done by\nusing two sonic frequencies chosen according to a well-established technique.\nAlternatively, one could use a single\nsonic frequency low enough not to be\nsubject to the phase ambiguity, albeit\nwith some loss of density resolution. Simulations indicate that a density accuracy\nmeasurement of 0.25 percent (0.0025)\ncan be attained with a single-tone system.\nThis work was done by G. D. Arndt and\nPhong Ngo of Johnson Space Center\nand J. R. Carl and Kent A. Byerly, independent consultants.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and\na patent application has been filed.

These constraints are derived\n\n8\n\nfrom the basic equation for the gravitational potential and from mathematical\nidentities that apply to the gravitational\npotential and its partial derivatives with\nrespect to spatial coordinates.\nConsider the gravitational potential \xcf\x86\nin a Cartesian coordinate system {x1,x2,x3}.\n\nThe ith component of gravitational acceleration is given by\ngi = \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82\xcf\x86\n\xe2\x88\x82xi\n\n(where i = 1, 2, or 3) and the (\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2) com-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nponent of the gravity-gradient tensor\nis given by\n\xce\x93\xce\xb1\xce\xb2 \xe2\x89\xa1\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\x82g \xce\xb1\n\xe2\x88\x82 2\xcf\x86\n=\n\xe2\x88\x82x \xce\xb2\n\xe2\x88\x82x \xce\xb2 \xe2\x88\x82x \xce\xb1\n\nwhere \xce\xb1 = 1, 2, or 3 and \xce\xb2 = 1, 2, or 3. The\naforementioned constraints are such that\nthe components of the gravity-gradient\ntensor are not independent of each other.\nIn particular, it is easily shown that the\ngravity-gradient tensor is symmetrical and\nhas a zero trace; that is,\n\xce\x93\xce\xb1\xce\xb2 = \xce\x93\xce\xb2\xce\xb1 and \xce\x9311+ \xce\x9322 +\xce\x9333 = 0.\nHence, if one measures all the components of the gravity-gradient tensor at all\npoints of interest within a region of space\nin which one seeks to characterize the\ngravitational field, one obtains redundant information. One could utilize the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nconstraints to select a minimum (that is,\nnonredundant) set of measurements\nfrom which the gravitational potential\ncould be reconstructed. Alternatively,\none could exploit the redundancy to reduce errors from noisy measurements.\nA convenient example is that of the\nselection of a minimum set of measurements to characterize the gravitational\nfield at n3 points (where n is an integer)\nin a cube. Without the benefit of such a\nselection, it would be necessary to make\n9n3 measurements because the gravitygradient tensor has 9 components at\neach point. It has been shown that when\nthe constraints are applied to the measurement points in an appropriately\nchosen sequence, the number of measurements needed to compute all 9n3\ncomponents is only n3+n2+3n.\n\nThe problem of utilizing the redundancy to reduce errors in noisy measurements is an optimization problem: Given a\nset of noisy values of the components of\nthe gravity-gradient tensor at the measurement points, one seeks a set of corrected\nvalues \xe2\x80\x94 a set that is optimum in that it\nminimizes some measure of error (e.g.,\nthe sum of squares of the differences between the corrected and noisy measurement values) while taking account of the\nfact that the constraints must apply to the\nexact values. The problem as thus posed\nleads to a vector equation that can be\nsolved to obtain the corrected values.\nThis work was done by Igor Kulikov and\nMichail Zak of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The purpose of the chirped\nsuperlattice is to increase the quantum\nefficiency of the device.\nA somewhat lengthy background discussion is necessary to give meaning to a\nbrief description of the present developmental QWIP. A BID QWIP was described in \xe2\x80\x9cMQW Based Block Intersubband Detector for Low-Background\nOperation\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-21073), NASA Tech\nBriefs Vol. 25, No. 7 (July 2001), page 46.\nTo recapitulate: The BID design was conceived in response to the deleterious effects of operation of a QWIP at low temperature under low background\nradiation. These effects can be summarized as a buildup of space charge and an\nassociated high impedance and diminution of responsivity with increasing modulation frequency.\n\n12\n\nThe BID design, which reduces these\ndeleterious effects, calls for a heavily doped\nmultiple-quantum-well (MQW) emitter\nsection with barriers that are thinner than\nin prior MQW devices. The thinning of the\nbarriers results in a large overlap of sublevel wave functions, thereby creating a\nminiband. Because of sequential resonant\nquantum-mechanical tunneling of electrons from the negative ohmic contact to\nand between wells, any space charge is\nquickly neutralized. At the same time, what\nwould otherwise be a large component of\ndark current attributable to tunneling current through the whole device is suppressed by placing a relatively thick, undoped, impurity-free Alx Ga1\xe2\x80\x93x As blocking\nbarrier layer between the MQW emitter\nsection and the positive ohmic contact.\n[This layer is similar to the thick, undoped\nAlx Ga1\xe2\x80\x93x As layers used in photodetectors\nof the blocked-impurity-band (BIB) type.]\nNotwithstanding the aforementioned\nadvantage afforded by the BID design,\nthe responsivity of a BID QWIP is very\n\nlow because of low collection efficiency,\nwhich, in turn, is a result of low electrostatic-potential drop across the superlattice emitter. Because the emitter must be\nelectrically conductive to prevent the\nbuildup of space charge in depleted\nquantum wells, most of the externally applied bias voltage drop occurs across the\nblocking-barrier layer. This completes\nthe background discussion.\nIn the developmental QWIP, the periodic superlattice of the prior BID design\nis to be replaced with the chirped superlattice, which is expected to provide a\nbuilt-in electric field. As a result, the efficiency of collection of photoexcited\ncharge carriers (and, hence, the net\nquantum efficiency and thus responsivity) should increase significantly.\nThis work was done by Sarath Gunapala,\nDavid Ting, and Sumith Bandara of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nNPO-30510\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nCharge-Dissipative Electrical Cables\nLossy dielectric layers and grounding conductors drain spurious charges to ground.\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nElectrical cables that dissipate spurious static electric charges, in addition to\nperforming their main functions of conducting signals, have been developed.\nThese cables are intended for use in\ntrapped-ion or ionizing-radiation environments, in which electric charges tend\nto accumulate within, and on the surfaces of, dielectric layers of cables. If the\ncharging rate exceeds the dissipation\nrate, charges can accumulate in excessive amounts, giving rise to high-current\ndischarges that can damage electronic\ncircuitry and/or systems connected to it.\nThe basic idea of design and operation\nof charge-dissipative electrical cables is to\ndrain spurious charges to ground by use\nof lossy (slightly electrically conductive)\ndielectric layers, possibly in conjunction\nwith drain wires and/or drain shields\n(see figure). In typical cases, the drain\nwires and/or drain shields could be electrically grounded via the connector assemblies at the ends of the cables, in any\nof the conventional techniques for\ngrounding signal conductors and signal\nshields. In some cases, signal shields\ncould double as drain shields.\nTo be suitable for use in a charge-dissipating cable, a dielectric material must be\ninherently lossy throughout its bulk, and\nnot, say, an insulating polymer with a\nconductive surface film or containing\nembedded conductive particles. Conductive surface films can be rendered inef-\n\nfective by flaking off or cracking, especially when cables are bent. Embedded\nparticles can act as defect sites that initiate arcing within dielectric layers.\nThe concept of lossiness can be quantified: Dielectric materials can be broadly\ncategorized, as either \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9clossy\xe2\x80\x9d\naccording to their volume electrical resistivity (\xcf\x81) values. Excellent insulators\nmay be roughly categorized as having \xcf\x81\nof the order of 1016\xe2\x84\xa6\xe2\x8b\x85m, while lossy or\ndissipative insulators may be categorized\nas having \xcf\x81 of the order of 109 \xe2\x84\xa6\xe2\x8b\x85m.\nIn designing for a specific application,\none must choose the lossy dielectric material and the configuration of grounding\nconductors to be capable of dissipating a\nsufficient proportion of static charge\nwithin an acceptably short time. For a typical cable that handles signals of sufficiently low frequencies (having wavelengths much greater than the length of\nthe cable), the effective charge-dissipating\nadmittance or conductance must be much\nless than the nominal signal admittance or\nsignal conductance of the circuits connected with the cable, so as not to adversely affect the transmission of signals.\nFor a typical cable that handles signals of\nsufficiently high frequencies (having wavelengths comparable to or less than the\nlength of the cable), the effective chargedissipating admittance or conductance\nmust be taken into account as part of the\noverall signal-propagation cable imped-\n\nDrain\nWires\n\nLossy\nDielectric\n\nDrain\nShields\n\nSignal\nConductors\n\nThis Cross Section illustrates one of many possible charge-dissipating designs for a cable containing 11 signal conductors.\n\nance, and the signal attenuation caused by\nloss in the dielectric must be acceptably\nlow. These requirements could be difficult\nto satisfy if a cable is too long and, hence,\nimposes either a limit on the allowable\nlength of the cable or else a requirement\nto pay closer attention to interactions between the charge-dissipation and signalpropagation aspects of the cable design.\nThis work was done by John R.

Conventional underwater\ncameras and their light sources are\nhoused in pods that keep the contents\ndry and maintain interior pressures of\nabout 1 atmosphere (\xe2\x89\x880.1 MPa). Pods\nstrong enough to withstand the pressures at great ocean depths are bulky,\nheavy, and expensive. Elimination of the\npods would make it possible to build\ncamera/light-source units that would be\nsignificantly smaller, lighter, and less ex-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\npensive. The depth ratings of the proposed camera/light source units would\nbe essentially unlimited because the\nstrengths of their housings would no\nlonger be an issue.\nA camera according to the proposal\nwould contain an active-pixel image sensor and readout circuits, all in the form\nof a single silicon-based complementary\nmetal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) integrated-circuit chip. As long as none of\nthe circuitry and none of the electrical\nleads were exposed to seawater, which is\nelectrically conductive, silicon inte-\n\ngrated-circuit chips could withstand the\nhydrostatic pressure of even the deepest\nocean. The pressure would change the\nsemiconductor band gap by only a slight\namount \xe2\x80\x94 not enough to degrade imaging performance significantly.\nElectrical contact with seawater would\nbe prevented by potting the integratedcircuit chip in a transparent plastic case.\nThe electrical leads for supplying power\nto the chip and extracting the video signal would also be potted, though not\nnecessarily in the same transparent plastic. The hydrostatic pressure would tend\n\n13\n\nto compress the plastic case and the chip\nequally on all sides; there would be no\nneed for great strength because there\nwould be no need to hold back high\npressure on one side against low pressure\non the other side. A light source suitable\nfor use with the camera could consist of\nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs). Like integrated-circuit chips, LEDs can withstand\nvery large hydrostatic pressures.\nIf power-supply regulators or filter capacitors were needed, these could be at-\n\ntached in chip form directly onto the\nback of, and potted with, the imager\nchip. Because CMOS imagers dissipate\nlittle power, the potting would not result\nin overheating. To minimize the cost of\nthe camera, a fixed lens could be fabricated as part of the plastic case. For improved optical performance at greater\ncost, an adjustable glass achromatic lens\nwould be mounted in a reservoir that\nwould be filled with transparent oil and\nsubject to the full hydrostatic pressure,\n\nand the reservoir would be mounted on\nthe case to position the lens in front of\nthe image sensor. The lens would by adjusted for focus by use of a motor inside\nthe reservoir (oil-filled motors already\nexist).\nThis work was done by Thomas Cunningham of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

That\nis to say, the objects to be identified would\nserve as substrates for the deposition and\npatterning of the materials of the devices\nused to identify them, and each identification device would be bonded to the\nidentified object at the molecular level.\nVacuum arc vapor deposition (VAVD) is\nthe NASA\xe2\x80\x93derived process for depositing\nlayers of material on the substrate.\nThis proposal stands in contrast to the\ncurrent practice of fabricating RFID\nand/or memory devices as wafer-based,\nself-contained integrated-circuit chips\nthat are subsequently embedded in or attached to plastic cards to make \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d\naccount-information cards and identification badges. If one relies on such a chip\nto store data on the history of an object to\nbe tracked and the chip falls off or out of\nthe object, then one loses both the his-\n\n14\n\ntorical data and the means to track the\nobject and verify its identity electronically. Also, in contrast is the manufacturing philosophy in use today to make\nmany memory devices. Today\xe2\x80\x99s methods\ninvolve many subtractive processes such\nas etching. This proposal only uses additive methods, building RFID and memory\ndevices from the substrate up in thin layers. VAVD is capable of spraying silicon,\ncopper, and other materials commonly\nused in electronic devices. The VAVD\nprocess sprays most metals and some ceramics. The material being sprayed has a\nvery strong bond with the substrate,\nwhether that substrate is metal, ceramic,\nor even wood, rock, glass, PVC, or paper.\nAn object to be tagged with an identification device according to the proposal must be compatible with a vacuum\ndeposition process. Temperature is seldom an issue as the substrate rarely\nreaches 150\xc2\xb0 F (66\xc2\xb0 C) during the deposition process. A portion of the surface\nof the object would be designated as a\n\nsubstrate for the deposition of the device. By use of a vacuum arc vapor deposition apparatus, a thin electrically insulating film would first be deposited on\nthe substrate. Subsequent layers of materials would then be deposited and patterned by use of known integrated-circuit fabrication techniques. The total\nthickness of the deposited layers could\nbe much less than the 100-\xc2\xb5m thickness\nof the thinnest state-of-the-art self-contained microchips. Such a thin deposit\ncould be readily concealed by simply\npainting over it. Both large vacuum\nchambers for production runs and\nportable hand-held devices for in situ applications are available.\nThis work was done by Harry F. Schramm\nof Marshall Space Flight Center.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

All of the modeling capabilities\nafforded by this software are available independently in other, separate software\nsystems, but have not previously been\nbrought together in a single system. A\nuser can choose among several dynamical models, many high-fidelity environment models, and several numerical-integration schemes. The user can select\nwhether to use models that assume weak\ncoupling between spacecraft, or strong\ncoupling in the case of feedback control\nor tethering of spacecraft to each other.\nFor weak coupling, spacecraft orbits are\npropagated independently, and are synchronized in time by controlling the\nstep size of the integration. For strong\ncoupling, the orbits are integrated simultaneously. Among the integration\nschemes that the user can choose are\nRunge-Kutta Verner, Prince-Dormand,\nAdams-Bashforth-Moulton, and BulirshStoer. Comparisons of performance are\nincluded for both the weak- and strongcoupling dynamical models for all of the\nnumerical integrators.

This approach for\nattitude path planning makes full use of\na priori constraint knowledge and is computationally tractable enough to be executed onboard a spacecraft. The approach is based on incorporating the\nconstraints into a cost function and\nusing a Genetic Algorithm to iteratively\nsearch for and optimize the solution.\nThis results in a directed random search\nthat explores a large part of the solution\nspace while maintaining the knowledge\nof good solutions from iteration to iteration. A solution obtained this way may\nbe used \xe2\x80\x98as is\xe2\x80\x99 or as an initial solution to\ninitialize additional deterministic optimization algorithms. A number of representative case examples for time-fixed\nand time-varying conditions yielded\nsearch times that are typically on the\norder of minutes, thus demonstrating\nthe viability of this method. This approach is applicable to all deep space\nand planet Earth missions requiring\ngreater spacecraft autonomy, and\ngreatly facilitates navigation and science\nobservation planning.\nThis work was done by Richard P.

MPT noise arises\nwhen the fan is operating with supersonic relative tip Mach No. Under this\nflow condition, there is a strong upstream running shock. The strength\nand position of this shock are very sensitive to blade geometry variations. For\na fan where all the blades are identical,\nthe primary tone observed upstream of\nthe fan will be the blade passing frequency. If there are small variations in\ngeometry between blades, then tones\nbelow the blade passing frequency\narise \xe2\x80\x94 MPTs. Stagger angle differences as small as 0.1\xc2\xb0 can give rise to\nsignificant MPT. It is also noted that\nMPT noise is more pronounced when\nthe fan is operating in an \xe2\x80\x9cunstarted\xe2\x80\x9d\nmode. Computational results using a\nthree-dimensional flow solver to compute the complete annulus flow with\nnon-uniform fans indicate that MPT\nnoise can be estimated in a relatively\nsimple way. Hence, once the effect of a\ntypical geometry variation of one blade\nin an otherwise uniform blade row is\nknown, the effect of all the blades\nbeing different can be quickly computed via superposition. Two computer\nprograms that were developed as part\nof this work are used in conjunction\nwith a user\xe2\x80\x99s computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict MPT\nspectra for a fan with a specified set of\ngeometric variations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The first program ROTBLD reads the\nusers CFD solution files for a single\nblade passage via an API (Application\nProgram Interface). There are options\nto replicate and perturb the geometry\nwith typical variations stagger, camber,\nthickness, and pitch. The multi-passage\nCFD solution files are then written in\nthe user\xe2\x80\x99s file format using the API.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The second program SUPERPOSE requires two input files: the first is the circumferential upstream pressure distribution extracted from the CFD solution\non the multi-passage mesh, the second\nfile defines the geometry variations of\neach blade in a complete fan. Superposition is used to predict the spectra resulting from the geometric variations.\nThe user would typically generate a\nmulti-passage mesh (ROTBLD) with the\ngeometry of one blade perturbed \xe2\x80\x94 typ-\n\nically, four or five passages are required.\nA CFD solution would then be generated for this mesh. Using this solution\nand specified geometry variations for a\ncomplete fan, the MPT spectra can be\nestimated using SUPERPOSE.\nThese programs were written by Stuart D.\nConnell of General Electric Corp. for Glenn\nResearch Center.

The limitation in question is caused by the desired decrease in the concentration of\nions during purification: As the concentration of ions decreases, the electrical resistivity of the water increases,\nposing an electrical barrier to the removal of the remaining ions. In the\npresent technique, this limitation is\novercome by use of electrodes, a flowfield structure, and solid electrolytes\nconfigured to provide conductive paths\nfor the removal of ions from the water\nto be deionized, even when the water\nhas already been purified to a high degree.\nThe technique involves the use of a\nbipolar membrane unit (BMU), which\nincludes a cation-exchange membrane\nand an anion-exchange membrane separated by a nonconductive mesh that\nhas been coated by an ionically conductive material (see figure). The\nmesh ensures the desired microseparation between the ion-exchange membranes: The interstices bounded by the\ninner surfaces of the membranes and\nthe outer surfaces of the coated mesh\nconstitute a flow-field structure that allows the water that one seeks to deionize (hereafter called \xe2\x80\x9cprocess water\xe2\x80\x9d\nfor short) to flow through the BMU\nwith a low pressure drop. The flow-field\nstructure is such that the distance between any point in the flow field and an\nionically conductive material is small;\nthus, the flow-field structure facilitates\nthe diffusion of molecules and ions to\nand from the ion-exchange membranes.\nThe BMU is placed between an anode\nand a cathode, but not in direct contact\nwith these electrodes. Instead, the space\nbetween the anionexchange membrane\nand the anode is denoted the anode\ncompartment and is filled with an ionic\nsolution. Similarly, the space between\nthe cation-exchange membrane and the\ncathode is denoted the cathode compartment and is filled with a different\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nIonically-Conductive\nCoating\n\n+\n\nOH\xe2\x80\x93\n\nOH\xe2\x80\x93\n\nAnode\nCl\xe2\x80\x93\nAnode Compartment\n\nH2O\n\nH2O\n\nAnion-Exchange\nMembrane\nNaCl\n\nProcess\nWater in\nFlow Field\nCation-Exchange\nMembrane\n\nCathode Compartment\nH+\n\nH+\n\nNa+\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\nCathode\n\nA Bipolar Membrane Unit contains a flow-field structure and solid electrolytes configured to provide\nconductive paths for the removal of ions from process water.\n\nionic solution. The electrodes are made\nof titanium coated with platinum.\nThe process water is introduced into\nthe BMU, and a dc potential is applied\nbetween the electrodes. The ion-exchange membranes contain networks of\nmolecular-size pores with electric\ncharges fixed to their matrices. An ionexchange membrane is nominally electronically nonconductive but is conductive to counterions; that is, to ions of\ncharge opposite that of the ions immobilized in it. Because of the semipermeability of the membranes and the direction of the electric field between the\nelectrodes, negatively charged ions migrate from the process water towards the\nanode and positively charged ions migrate from the process water towards the\ncathode. The ions thus removed from\nthe process water become concentrated\nin the water in the anode and cathode\ncompartments.\nThe removal of ions from the process\nwater includes salt-splitting reactions\n(e.g., the separation of Na+ and Cl\xe2\x80\x93\nions). In addition, some water molecules\ndissociate into H+ and OH\xe2\x80\x93 ions. The\n\ncombination of this water splitting reaction and the highly efficient transfer of\nthe H+ and OH\xe2\x80\x93 ions by the respective\nmembranes ensures high transmembrane ionic conductivity, even when the\nconcentrations of other ions in the\nprocess water are low.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new design for a water-filtering device combines rotating filtration with reverse osmosis to create a rotating reverse-osmosis system. Rotating filtration\nhas been used for separating plasma\nfrom whole blood, while reverse osmosis\nhas been used in purification of water\nand in some chemical processes. Reverse-osmosis membranes are vulnerable\nto concentration polarization \xe2\x80\x94 a type\nof fouling in which the chemicals meant\nnot to pass through the reverse-osmosis\nmembranes accumulate very near the\nsurfaces of the membranes. The combination of rotating filtration and reverse\nosmosis is intended to prevent concentration polarization and thereby increase the desired flux of filtered water\nwhile decreasing the likelihood of passage of undesired chemical species\nthrough the filter. Devices based on this\nconcept could be useful in a variety of\ncommercial applications, including purification and desalination of drinking\nwater, purification of pharmaceutical\nprocess water, treatment of household\nand industrial wastewater, and treatment\nof industrial process water.\nA rotating filter consists of a cylindrical porous microfilter rotating within a\nstationary concentric cylindrical outer\nshell (see figure). The aqueous suspension enters one end of the annulus between the inner and outer cylinders. Filtrate passes through the rotating\ncylindrical microfilter and is removed\nvia a hollow shaft. The concentrated suspension is removed at the end of the annulus opposite the end where the suspension entered.\nThe effectiveness of a rotating filter in\npreventing fouling comes from high\nfluid shear caused by the rotation and\nfrom the appearance of a vortical flow\nstructure known as Taylor vortices: the\nresultant flow field tends to wash particles off the rotating filter.\nIn reverse osmosis, water is forced at\nhigh pressure through a membrane\nmade of a material through which contaminants in aqueous solution pass\nmuch more slowly than does water.\nHence, the concentration of undesired\ndissolved compounds is decreased by\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nRotation (Typical Speed\n100 rpm)\nContaminated\nWater In\n\nStationary Shell\n\nRotating Porous Filter\n\nFiltrate Channel\n\nConcentrated\nWaste Out\nHollow Shaft\n\nPurified Water Out\n\nThe Flow Through a Rotating Osmosis Device is shown. Shear and vortices that arise in the liquid flowing between the rotating filter and the stationary outer shell wash away material that would otherwise accumulate on or near the filter surface and thereby cause fouling.\n\nforcing the water through the membrane, creating purified water. In conventional practice, concentration polarization of reverse-osmosis membranes is\noften reduced by using cross-flows (flows\nparallel to the membrane surfaces) to\nwash away the concentrated chemicals,\nbut this is not always effective without\ncleaning or back washing.\nThe rotating reverse-osmosis device\nresembles a conventional rotating filter,\nexcept that the cylindrical porous microfilter is replaced with a cylindrical reverse-osmosis membrane. The shear and\nthe Taylor vortices generated by the rotation of the cylindrical reverse-osmosis\nmembrane wash away the concentrationpolarization layer. The latest prototype\nof a rotating reverse-osmosis module incorporates special rotating seals to solve\none of the most difficult problems in the\nsystem, enabling the device to withstand\nthe differential pressures needed for\n\noperation period: Whereas microfiltration systems operate at differential pressures of the order of 1 atmosphere (\xe2\x89\x880.1\nMPa), reverse-osmosis systems operate at\ndifferential pressures as high as 30 to 50\natmospheres (\xe2\x89\x883 to 5 MPa).\nThis work was done by Richard M.

This approach stands in contradistinction to\nprior approaches in (1) the macroscopic size range (the size range of conventional design and fabrication, characterized by overall device dimensions\nof many centimeters) and (2) the microscopic size range [the size range\nof microelectromechanical systems\n(MEMS), characterized by overall device dimensions of the order of a millimeter or less]. The mesoscale approach offers some of the advantage of\nthe MEMS approach (sizes and power\ndemands smaller than those of the\nmacroscale approach) and some of the\nadvantage of the macroscale approach\n(the possibility of achieving relative dimensional precision greater than that of\nthe MEMS approach).\nRelative dimensional precision is a\nmajor issue in the operation of a vibratory gyroscope. The heart of a vibratory\ngyroscope is a mechanical resonator that\nis required to have a specified symmetry\n\nin a plane orthogonal to the axis about\nwhich rotation is to be measured. If the\nresonator could be perfectly symmetrical, then in the absence of rotation, a\nfree vibration of the resonator could remain fixed along any orientation relative\nto its housing; that is, the gyroscope\ncould exhibit zero drift. In practice,\nmanufacturing imprecision gives rise to\nsome asymmetry in mass, flexural stiffness or dissipation, resulting in a slight\ndrift or beating motion of an initial vibration pattern that cannot be distinguished from rotation.\nIn the mesoscale approach, one exploits the following concepts: For a\ngiven amount of dimensional error\ngenerated in manufacturing, the asymmetry and hence the rate-of-rotation\ndrift of the gyroscope can be reduced\nby increasing the scale. The decrease in\nasymmetry also reduces coupling of vibrations to the external environment.\nMechanical thermal noise and electronic measurement noise and drift\ncan also be reduced by increasing the\nsize of the resonator and its associated\nsensors.\nIn the mesoscale approach, a resonator is fabricated from a silicon wafer.\nCentral to the mesoscale approach is a\n\ncombination of (1) precise polishing of\nboth faces of the wafer to form parallel\nplanar upper and lower resonator surfaces and (2) dry reactive-ion etching\n(DRIE) to remove material from the\nsides of the resonator perpendicular to\nthe upper and lower surfaces.\nAn experimental resonator was designed and fabricated following the\nmesoscale approach. Its frequency split\n(the difference between the natural frequencies of its two nominal orthogonal\nvibration modes \xe2\x80\x94 a measure of its\nasymmetry) was so small as to be undetectable at a resonance quality factor (Q)\nof 105, as observed in operation in a\nnominal vacuum with residual pressure\nof 10\xe2\x80\x935 torr (\xe2\x89\x881.3 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x933 Pa). Throughout intensive experimentation, it was observed that keeping the thickness of the\nwafer as nearly uniform as possible was\nthe main requirement for keeping the\nfrequency split small, whereas the frequency split was not much affected by\nthe side-wall roughness resulting from\nDRIE.\nThis work was done by Eui-Hyeok Yang of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Potential\napplications for robots having this capability include scientific exploration (both\non Earth and other rocky bodies in\nspace), military reconnaissance, and outdoor search and rescue operations.\nUntil now, enabling robots to traverse\ncliffs has been considered too difficult a\ntask because of the perceived need of\nprohibitively sophisticated planning algorithms as well as end effectors as dexterous as human hands. The present\nend effectors are being designed to enable robots to attach themselves to typical rock-face features with less planning\n\n20\n\nand simpler end effectors. This advance\nis based on the emulation of the equipment used by human climbers rather\nthan the emulation of the human hand.\nClimbing-aid equipment, specifically\ncams, aid hooks, and cam hooks, are\nused by sport climbers when a quick ascent of a cliff is desired (see Figure 1).\nCurrently two different end-effector\ndesigns have been created. The first, denoted the simple hook emulator, consists\nof three \xe2\x80\x9cfingers\xe2\x80\x9d arranged around a central \xe2\x80\x9cpalm.\xe2\x80\x9d Each finger emulates the\nfunction of a particular type of climbing\nhook (aid hook, wide cam hook, and a\nnarrow cam hook). These fingers are\nconnected to the palm via a mechanical\nlinkage actuated with a leadscrew/nut.\n\nThis mechanism allows the fingers to be\nextended or retracted. The second design, denoted the advanced hook emulator (see Figure 2), shares these features,\nbut it incorporates an aid hook and a cam\nhook into each finger. The spring-loading of the aid hook allows the passive selection of the type of hook used.\nThe end effectors can be used in several different modes. In the aid-hook\nmode, the aid hook on one of the fingers locks onto a horizontal ledge while\nthe other two fingers act to stabilize the\nend effector against the cliff face. In the\ncam-hook mode, the broad, flat tip of\nthe cam hook is inserted into a non-horizontal crack in the cliff face.

The fingers are then extended as\nfar as the feature allows. Any weight then\ntransferred to the end effector will tend\nto extend the fingers further due to frictional force, passively increasing the grip\non the feature. In addition to the climbing modes, these end effectors can be\nused to walk on (either on the palm or\nthe fingertips) and to grasp objects by\nfully extending the fingers.\nThis work was done by Brett Kennedy and\nPatrick Leger of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The disadvantage\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nof (1) is that a bellows is expensive and\nmay not be reliable; the disadvantage of\n(2) is that bubbles can cause fluid lockup\nand consequent loss of damping. In the\nimproved damper, the ring would be\nnearly completely filled with liquid, and\nexpansion would be accommodated, but\nnot by a bellows. Instead, an escape tube\nwould be attached to the ring. The escape tube would be positioned and oriented so that the artificial gravitation and\n\nthe associated buoyant force generated\nby the spin of the spacecraft would cause\nthe bubbles to migrate toward the tip of\nthe tube. In addition, when the spacecraft was on the launch pad, the escape\ntube would be at the top of the ring, so\nthat bubbles would rise into the tube.\nThis work was done by Mark A.

The invention is\napplicable to both air-breathing and\nrocket engines used to propel some aircraft and spacecraft, respectively.\nIn a detonative combustion engine,\nthrust is generated through the expulsion of combustion products from a detonation process in which combustion\ntakes place in a reaction zone coupled to\na shock wave. The combustion releases\nenergy to sustain the shock wave, while\nthe shock wave enhances the combus-\n\ntion in the reaction zone. The coupled\nshockwave/reaction zone, commonly referred to as a detonation, propagates\nthrough the reactants at very high speed\n\xef\xa3\xa7 typically of the order of several thousands of feet per second (of the order of\n1 km/s). The very high speed of the detonation forces combustion to occur very\nrapidly, thereby contributing to high\nthermodynamic efficiency.\nA detonative combustion engine of the\ntype to which the present invention applies includes multiple parallel cylindrical combustion tubes, each closed at the\nfront end and open at the rear end. Each\n\ntube is filled with a fuel/oxidizer mixture, and then a detonation wave is initiated at the closed end. The wave propagates rapidly through the fuel/oxidizer\nmixture, producing very high pressure\ndue to the rapid combustion. The high\npressure acting on the closed end of the\ntube contributes to forward thrust. When\nthe detonation wave reaches the open\nend of the tube, it produces a blast wave,\nbehind which the high-pressure combustion products are expelled from the tube.\nThe process of filling each combustion\ntube with a detonable fuel/oxidizer mixture and then producing a detonation is\n\nRear\n(Downstream)\n4\n\nFront\n(Upstream)\n\n3\n\nCoolant\nManifolds\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\nThroat\n\n2\n\n1\nCommon\nPlenum\n\n4\n\nCombustion Tubes\nInterface\nSection\n\nExpansion Sector\n\nFLOW CROSS SECTION 3-3\nFLOW CROSS SECTION 2-2\nFLOW CROSS SECTION 4-4\n\nExhaust From\nFiring Combustor Tube\n\nFLOW CROSS SECTION 1-1\nExhaust From\nFilling Combustor Tube\n\nSequentially Pulsed Exhaust Streams from multiple combustion tubes are channeled in such a manner as to maintain a nearly steady back pressure needed\nfor refilling the combustion tubes with fuel/oxidizer mixture.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\n23\n\nrepeated rapidly to obtain repeated\npulses of thrust. Moreover, the multiple\ncombustion tubes are filled and fired in a\nrepeating sequence. Hence, the pressure\nat the outlet of each combustion tube\nvaries cyclically. A nozzle of the present invention channels the expansion of the\npulsed combustion gases from the multiple combustion tubes into a common exhaust stream, in such a manner as to enhance performance in two ways:\n(1) It reduces the cyclic variations of\npressure at the outlets of the combustion tubes so as to keep the pressure approximately constant near the optimum\nlevel needed for filling the tubes, regardless of atmospheric pressure at the\naltitude of operation; and\n(2) It maximizes the transfer of momentum from the exhaust gas to the engine, thereby maximizing thrust.\nThe figure depicts a typical engine\nequipped with a nozzle according to the invention. The nozzle includes an interface\nsection comprising multiple intake ports\n\nthat couple the outlets of the combustion\ntubes to a common plenum. Proceeding\nfrom its upstream to its downstream end,\nthe interface section tapers to a larger\ncross-sectional area for flow. This taper fosters expansion of the exhaust gases flowing\nfrom the outlets of the combustion tubes\nand contributes to the desired equalization\nof exhaust combustion pressure.\nThe cross-sectional area for flow in the\ncommon plenum is greater than, or at least\nequal to, the combined cross-sectional flow\nareas of the combustor tubes. In the common plenum, the exhaust streams from\nthe individual combustion tubes mix to\nform a single compound subsonic exhaust\nstream. Downstream of the common\nplenum is the throat that tapers to a\nsmaller flow cross section. In this throat,\nthe exhaust gases become compressed to\nform a compound sonic gas stream.\nDownstream of the throat is an expansion section, which typically has a bell or a\nconical shape. (The expansion section can\nbe truncated or even eliminated in the\n\ncase of an air-breathing engine.) After entering the expansion section, the exhaust\ngases expand rapidly from compound\nsonic to compound supersonic speeds and\nare then vented to the environment.\nThe basic invention admits of numerous\nvariations. For example, the combustion\ntubes can be arranged around the central\naxis in a symmetrical or asymmetrical pattern other than the one shown in the figure. For another example, the flow crosssectional area(s) of one or more of the\nintake ports in the interface section, of the\ncommon plenum, the throat, and/or the\nexpansion section can be varied, either\nsymmetrically or asymmetrically, to adjust\ndynamics of the exhaust stream or to direct\nthe thrust vector away from the central axis.\nThis work was done by Thomas E.\nBratkovich, Kevin E.

The design is intended to be\nadaptable to a large range of instrument\npayloads. The initial payload to which the\ndesign nominally applies is considered to\nbe a telescope, modeled as a simple thinwalled cylinder 24 ft (\xe2\x89\x887.3 m) long, 3 ft\n(\xe2\x89\x880.91 m) in diameter, weighing 1,500 lb\n(having a mass of \xe2\x89\x88680 kg).\nThe instrument would be mounted\non a set of motor-driven gimbals in\npitch-yaw configuration.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Directional Acceleration VectorDriven Displacement of Fluids (DAVDDOF) system, under development at the\ntime of reporting the information for this\narticle, would be a relatively compact, automated, centrifugally actuated system for\nstaining blood smears and other microbiological samples on glass microscope\nslides in either a microgravitational or a\nnormal Earth gravitational environment.\nThe DAVD-DOF concept is a successor to\nthe centrifuge-operated slide stainer\n(COSS) concept, which was reported in\n\xe2\x80\x9cSlide-Staining System for Microgravity or\nGravity\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC-22949), NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 25, No. 1 (January, 2001), page 64.\nThe COSS includes reservoirs and a staining chamber that contains a microscope\nslide to which a biological sample is affixed. The staining chamber is sequentially filled with and drained of staining\nand related liquids from the reservoirs by\nuse of a weighted plunger to force liquid\nfrom one reservoir to another at a constant level of hypergravity maintained in\na standard swing-bucket centrifuge.\nIn the DAVD-DOF system, a staining\nchamber containing a sample would also\nbe sequentially filled and emptied, but\nwith important differences. Instead of a\nsimple microscope slide, one would use a\nspecial microscope slide on which would\nbe fabricated a network of very small\nreservoirs and narrow channels connected to a staining chamber (see figure).

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe Anthropomorphic Robotic Testbed (ART) is an experimental prototype\nof a partly anthropomorphic, humanoid-size, mobile robot. The basic\nART design concept provides for a combination of two-armed coordination,\ntactility, stereoscopic vision, mobility\nwith navigation and avoidance of obstacles, and natural-language communication, so that the ART could emulate humans in many activities. The ART could\nbe developed into a variety of highly capable robotic assistants for general or\nspecific applications. There is especially\ngreat potential for the development of\nART-based robots as substitutes for livein health-care aides for home-bound\npersons who are aged, infirm, or physically handicapped; these robots could\ngreatly reduce the cost of home health\ncare and extend the term of independent living.\nThe ART is a fully autonomous and\nuntethered system. It includes a mobile\nbase on which is mounted an extensible\ntorso topped by a head, shoulders, and\ntwo arms. All subsystems of the ART are\npowered by a rechargeable, removable\nbattery pack. The mobile base is a differentially-driven, nonholonomic vehicle\ncapable of a speed >1 m/s and can handle a payload >100 kg. The base can be\ncontrolled manually, in forward/backward and/or simultaneous rotational\nmotion, by use of a joystick. Alternatively, the motion of the base can be controlled autonomously by an onboard\nnavigational computer.\n\n26\n\nBy retraction or extension of the\ntorso, the head height of the ART can\nbe adjusted from 5 ft (1.5 m) to 6 1/2 ft\n(2 m), so that the arms can reach either\nthe floor or high shelves, or some ceilings. The arms are symmetrical. Each\narm (including the wrist) has a total of\nsix rotary axes like those of the human\nshoulder, elbow, and wrist joints. The\narms are actuated by electric motors in\ncombination with brakes and gas-spring\nassists on the shoulder and elbow joints.\nThe arms are operated under closedloop digital control. A receptacle for an\nend effector is mounted on the tip of\nthe wrist and contains a force-andtorque sensor that provides feedback\nfor force (compliance) control of the\narm. The end effector could be a tool or\na robot hand, depending on the application.\nThe ART includes several built-in,\nready-to-use sensory subsystems and has\nroom for addition of other sensors. One\nof the built-in sensory subsystems is a\nbumper/shield subsystem that includes\nmechanical tape switches and photodetectors to detect actual or incipient collisions with objects on the floor, plus ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby\noverhanging objects or walls. Other\nbuilt-in sensory subsystems include laserbased distance measuring equipment,\ndual cameras for vision (including\nstereoscopic vision), the aforementioned force-and-torque sensors, and\nshaft-angle encoders and switches that\nprovide position feedback for control of\n\nthe arms. The two cameras can be\npanned and tilted independently of\neach other; they can be aimed in different directions or the same direction.\nEach of the various sensory and motion-control subsystems operates in conjunction with a computer subsystem that\nprocesses the incoming sensory data and\ncontrols the affected component of the\nmotion. The navigational computer\ncommunicates with the sensory and\nbase-motion-control computers. Another computer processes the digitized\noutputs of the cameras and controls the\naiming, focus, and zoom of the cameras.\nStill another computer processes the\ndigitized outputs of the force-and-torque\nsensors and executes software for control of the motions of, and forces exerted by, the arms.\nOverall control is exerted by a host computer, which is of a Pentium-based laptop\nclass. This computer runs speech-recognition and speech-synthesis software for\ncommunication with a human user. For\npurposes of experimentation and development, the host computer is also capable\nof radio communication with an external\ncomputer or network of computers.\nThis work was done by J. F.

The method is especially appropriate for use in environments in which\nhumidity is not or cannot be controlled\n\xe2\x80\x94 for example, in the vicinity of a chemical spill, which can be accompanied by\nlarge local changes in humidity.\nHeretofore, it has been common practice to treat water vapor as merely another\nanalyte, the concentration of which is determined, along with that of the other analytes, in a computational process based\non deconvolution. This practice works\nwell, but leaves room for improvement:\nchanges in humidity can give rise to large\nchanges in electronic-nose responses. If\ncorrections for humidity are not made,\nthe large humidity-induced responses\nmay swamp smaller responses associated\nwith low concentrations of analytes.\n\nThe present method offers an improvement. The underlying concept is\nsimple: One augments an electronic\nnose with a separate humidity and a\nseparate temperature sensor. The outputs of the humidity and temperature\nsensors are used to generate values that\nare subtracted from the readings of the\nother sensors in an electronic nose to\ncorrect for the temperature-dependent\ncontributions of humidity to those\nreadings. Hence, in principle, what remains after corrections are the contributions of the analytes only. Laboratory\nexperiments on a first-generation electronic nose have shown that this\nmethod is effective and improves the\nsuccess rate of identification of analyte/water mixtures.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nBrush/fin thermal interfaces are being\ndeveloped to increase heat-transfer efficiency and thereby enhance the thermal\nmanagement of orbital replaceable units\n(ORUs) of electronic and other equipment aboard the International Space Station.\nBrush/fin thermal interfaces could also be\nused to increase heat-transfer efficiency in\nterrestrial electronic and power systems.\nIn a typical application according to\nconventional practice, a replaceable heatgenerating unit includes a mounting surface with black-anodized metal fins that\nmesh with the matching fins of a heat sink\nor radiator on which the unit is mounted.\nThe fins do not contact each other, but\ntransfer heat via radiation exchange. A\nbrush/fin interface also includes intermeshing fins, the difference being that\nthe gaps between the fins are filled with\nbrushes made of carbon or other fibers.\nThe fibers span the gap between intermeshed fins, allowing heat transfer by\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\nconduction through the fibers. The fibers\nare attached to the metal surfaces as velvetlike coats in the manner of the carbonfiber brush heat exchangers described in\nthe preceding article. The fiber brushes\nprovide both mechanical compliance and\nthermal contact, thereby ensuring low\ncontact thermal resistance.\nA certain amount of force is required to\nintermesh the fins due to sliding friction\nof the brush\xe2\x80\x99s fiber tips against the fins.\nThis force increases linearly with penetration distance, reaching ~1 psi (~6.9 kPa)\nfor full 2-in. (5.1 cm) penetration for the\nconventional radiant fin interface. Removal forces can be greater due to fiber\nbuckling upon reversing the sliding direction. This buckling force can be greatly reduced by biasing the fibers at an angle\nperpendicularly to the sliding direction.\nMeans of containing potentially harmful\ncarbon fiber debris, which is electrically\nconductive, have been developed.\n\nSmall prototype brush/fin thermal interfaces have been tested and found to\nexhibit temperature drops about onesixth of that of conventional meshing-fin\nthermal interface, when fabricated as a\nretrofit. In this case, conduction\nthrough the long, thin metal fins themselves becomes a thermal bottleneck.\nFurther improvement could be made by\nprescribing aluminum fins to be shorter\nand thicker than those of the conventional meshing-fin thermal interfaces;\nthe choice of height and thickness\nwould be optimized to obtain greater\noverall thermal conductance, lower\nweight, and lower cost.\nThis work was done by Timothy R.\nKnowles, Christopher L.

These schemes\ninvolve the use of error-correcting codes\nconcatenated with codes denoted constrained codes. These codes are decoded\nusing an interactive method.\nIn pulse-position modulation, time is\npartitioned into frames of M slots of equal\nduration. Each frame contains one pulsed\nslot (all others are non-pulsed). For a\ngiven channel, the dead-time constraints\nare defined as a maximum and a minimum on the allowable time between\npulses. For example, if a Q-switched laser\nis used to transmit the pulses, then the\nminimum allowable dead time is the time\nneeded to recharge the laser for the next\npulse. In the case of bits recorded on a\nmagnetic medium, the minimum allowable time between pulses depends on the\nrecording/playback speed and the minimum distance between pulses needed to\nprevent interference between adjacent\nbits during readout. The maximum allowable dead time for a given channel is the\nmaximum time for which it is possible to\nsatisfy the requirement to synchronize\nslots. In mathematical shorthand, the\ndead-time constraints for a given channel\nare represented by the pair of integers\n(d,k), where d is the minimum allowable\nnumber of zeroes between ones and k is\nthe maximum allowable number of zeroes between ones.\nA system of the type to which the present schemes apply is represented by a bi-\n\nInformation\nBits\nError-Correcting\nCode Encoder\n\nCoded Bits\n\nConstrainedCode\nEncoder\n\nConstrained\nCoded Bits\n\nLaser\nModulator\n\nAdditive White\nGaussian Noise\nInformation\nBits\nError-Correcting\nCode Decoder\n\nLikelihoods\n\nConstrainedCode\nDecoder\n\nReal-Valued\nStatistics\n\nLaser\nModulator\n\nError-Correcting and Constrained PPM Codes are concatenated at the transmitting end of a communication channel.\n\nnary-input, real-valued-output channel\nmodel illustrated in the figure. At the\ntransmitting end, information bits are first\nencoded by use of an error-correcting\ncode, then further encoded by use of a\nconstrained code. Several constrained\ncodes for channels subject to constraints\nof (d,\xe2\x88\x9e) have been investigated theoretically and computationally. The baseline\ncodes chosen for purposes of comparison\nwere simple PPM codes characterized by\nM-slot PPM frames separated by d-slot\ndead times.\nAnother category of codes investigated\nwas that of synchronous truncated pulseposition modulation (STPPM), which is\ngenerated by implementing synchronous\nvariable-length PPM codes in a new way.\nIn a synchronous variable-length PPM\ncode, mp bits are mapped to mq bits,\nwhere m, p, and q are positive integers, p\nand q are fixed, and m is allowed to vary.\nSuch a code is characterized by, among\nother things, a rate (average number of\nbits per slot) of p/q. In generating a\nSTPPM code, a procedure based partly on\na binary tree is followed in mapping un-\n\nconstrained binary sequences into the applicable constraint. In addition to the\ndead-time constraint, the code words involved in the mapping are subject to some\nmathematical constraints, a description of\nwhich would greatly exceed the space\navailable for this article.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of\nthe schemes investigated are not subject to\nany single, simple characterization. In general, it was found that for constrained PPM\ncodes concatenated with error-correcting\ncodes at the transmitting end and iterative\ndecoding at the receiving end, there are\nadvantages over baseline schemes with respect to error rate at a given signal-to-noise\nratio, throughput at a given error rate, and\ncomplexity relative to prior schemes that\ninclude iterative decoding.\nThis work was done by Bruce Moision and\nJon Hamkins of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The purpose of the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2004\n\ninvention is to help air-traffic controllers minimize those deviations of the\nairplanes from the trajectories preferred by their pilots that are needed to\n\nmake the airplanes comply with milesin-trail spacing requirements (defined\nbelow). The software is meant to be a\nmodular component of the Center-\n\n29\n\nTRACON Automation System (CTAS)\n(TRACON signifies \xe2\x80\x9cterminal radar approach control\xe2\x80\x9d). The invention reduces controllers\xe2\x80\x99 workloads and reduces fuel consumption by reducing the\nnumber of corrective clearances needed\nto achieve conformance with specified\nflow rates, without causing conflicts,\nwhile providing for more efficient distribution of spacing workload upstream\nand across air-traffic-control sectors.\nPrerequisite to a meaningful summary of the invention are definitions of\nthe terms \xe2\x80\x9cmiles in trail\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconflict\nprobe\xe2\x80\x9d:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cMiles in trail\xe2\x80\x9d signifies a specified distance, in nautical miles, required to be\nmaintained between airplanes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A conflict probe is a computer program that assists air-traffic controllers\nin maintaining safe distances between\naircraft by predicting conflicts (essentially, close approaches with potential\nfor collision) as long as 20 minutes in\nadvance. The predictions are made by\nuse of a combination of (1) information on the present state of the aircraft\n(horizontal positions, altitudes, and velocities) obtained by tracking; (2) information on the anticipated states of\nthe aircraft obtained from flight plans;\n(3) information on atmospheric conditions; and (4) information on the aerodynamics and engine performance\ncharacterization of the airplanes.\n\nIn broad terms, the inventive method\ninvolves establishment of a spacing reference geometry (described below);\nprediction of locations of all aircraft of\ninterest at the predicted time of intersection of the path of whichever of the\naircraft is expected to first intersect the\nspacing reference geometry; and determination of the distances between aircraft on the basis of their predicted locations at that time. The design spacing\nreference geometry includes a collection of fixed waypoints (including locations of navaids, airway intersections,\nand predetermined latitude/longitude\npositions); airspace sector boundaries;\narcs defined in reference to airports or\nother geographical locations; arbitrary\nlines in space; and combinations of line\nsegments.\nThe software generates a display that\nincludes the predicted locations and\nspacings of the aircraft of interest. The\nspacings can be indicated in any of a variety of formats \xe2\x80\x94 for example, alphanumerically on a list adjacent to a\nradar display showing flightpaths and\nspacing-reference-geometry features of\na region of interest. When an alteration\nin flight characteristics (course, speed,\nand/or altitude) of one or more of the\naircraft is proposed, the predicted locations and spacings are recalculated,\nthereby providing feedback as to conformance of the proposed alteration\n\nwith the spacing requirement. In addition, a conflict probe is preferably used\nto determine whether the proposed alteration could cause a conflict.\nBy selection of spacing-calculation parameters, an air-traffic controller can\nspecify whether the determination of\nspacing is one of rolling spacing, fixed\nspacing, absolute spacing distance, or\nrelative spacing distance. It is possible to\nimpose a \xe2\x80\x9cmeet spacing\xe2\x80\x9d requirement,\nin response to which the software proposes, to the controller, changes of\ncourse, speed, and altitude of one or\nmore of aircraft that would satisfy the\nspacing requirement. Aircraft may be\nselected by matching aircraft to input\nstream characteristics, as well as by directly identifying flights by controller\ninput, and the selection process can be\nrepeated at intervals. Spacing advisory\ndata are preferably reported to other\ncontrollers responsible for monitoring\neach aircraft.\nThis work was done by Steven Green and\nHeinz Erzberger of Ames Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn improved algorithm has been devised for training a recurrent multilayer perceptron (RMLP) for optimal\nperformance in predicting the behavior of a complex, dynamic, and noisy\nsystem multiple time steps into the future. [An RMLP is a computational\nneural network with self-feedback and\ncross-talk (both delayed by one time\nstep) among neurons in hidden layers]. Like other neural-network-training algorithms, this algorithm adjusts\nnetwork biases and synaptic-connection weights according to a gradient-\n\n30\n\ndescent rule. The distinguishing feature of this algorithm is a combination\nof global feedback (the use of predictions as well as the current output value\nin computing the gradient at each time\nstep) and recursiveness. The recursive\naspect of the algorithm lies in the inclusion of the gradient of predictions\nat each time step with respect to the\npredictions at the preceding time step;\nthis recursion enables the RMLP to\nlearn the dynamics. It has been conjectured that carrying the recursion to\neven earlier time steps would enable\n\nthe RMLP to represent a noisier, morecomplex system.\nThis work was done by Alexander G.

As a\nresult, angstrom-level precision would\nbe needed in only the small nulling combiner, and not in large, meter-sized optics.
