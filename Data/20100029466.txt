The technology is useful\nin both flight water-<)uality monitoring\naboard spacecraft and in on-line monitoring of ethanol and glucose for control\nof fermentation bioreactors in brewing,\npharmaceutical, and other biotechnological applications. Sen or operation is\nbased upon the enzymatic oxidation of\nethanol or other target pecie to produce hydrogen peroxide, which then\nreacts with luminol to produce Light. The\nlight intensity, which i directly proportional to the concentration of the target\ncompound, is measured by a photomultiplier tube. The light-emitting reaction\nare promoted by using immobilized\nenzymes and solid- tate flow-through\nmodules that contain the required reactants. The lumine cent reactions are\nelectrically catalyzed.\n\nFire Resistant, Moisture\nBarrier Membrane\n(u.s. Patent No. 5,789,025)\nInvent or: Terry L. St. Cla ir, La ngley\nResearch Center\n\nThe present invention meets the continuing need for improved waterproof/breathable laminate for high-performance fabrics that are fire-re istant\nand either do not pre ent or significantly reduce the danger of toxic compound\nproduction. uch military and industrial\nobjects as military tents, gear, and hoes,\nairplane eat covers, and clothing for\nfirefighter\nor industrial worker\nexpo ed to high heat ource require\n\nuch film . The requirement is met with\na waterproof and breathable fire-re istant laminate comprising a ilicon rubber and a polyimide powder, the latter\nmade up of a plurality of polyimide particles uspended in the rubber so that\npathwa are created through the laminate to allow the passage of water vapor\nmolecules but not liquid water. The laminate i formed by applying a slurry of a\nsilicone precursor and the powder to a\nfabric or other uitable material, and\nconcurrently or equentially setting the\nlaminate thermally or with a catalyst or\nwith moi ture, depending on the nature\nof the precursor. Beneficial results have\nbeen achieved using the polyimide powder lARCTM_IA.\n\nTh ree-Deg ree-of-Freedom\nParallel Mechanical Linkage\n(u.s.\n\nPatent No. 5,816,105)\n\nInventor: Bernard D_Adelstein,\nAmes Research Center\n\nA unique parallel mechanism or\ninterface couples three-degree-of-freedom translational di placements at an\nendpoint such as a handle, a hand grip,\na robot tool, etc., to link rotation\naround three axes that are fixed with\nrespect to a common base or ground\nlink. The mechanism provides a new\noverall spatial linkage composed of a\nminimal number of rigid links and\nrotary joints that are arranged in three\nclo ed chain loops of six binary (twojoint) and four ternary (threejoint)\nlinks. The mechani m conveys mechanical power bidirectionally between the\nhuman operator and electromechanical actuator . The mechani m can be\nconstructed olely of rigid links and revolute pairs, and doe not require gears,\nbelts, cable, screw or other types of\ntransmission elements. Consequently it\nis useful in application requiring full\nbackdrivability, and can erve as the\nmechanical linkage for actively powered device such as compliant robotic\nmanipulators and force-reflecting hand\ncontroller, and pas ive device ucb as\nmanual input device for computer\nand other system.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the appropriate NASA Field\nCenter\'s Commercial Technology Office.

Scientists and engineers at ASA\'s Marshall\nSpace Flight Center in Huntsville, AL, are experimenting\nwith tethers as part of an effort to reduce the cost of\nspace tran portation. ProSEDS (Propulsive Small\nExpendable Deployer System) is scheduled for demonstration in August 2000.\nThe experiment will demonstrate the use of an electrodynamic tether - a long, thin wire - for propulsion. An\nelectrodynamic tether uses the same principles as electric\nmotors in toys, appliances, and computer disk drives when a wire moves through a magnetic field, an electrical current results. When electrical current flows through\na tether connected to a spacecraft, the force exerted on\nthe tether rai es or lowers the orbit of the satellite.\n"Tether propulsion requires no fuel , is completely\nreusable and environmentally clean , and provides all\nthree features at low cost," explained LesJohnson, principal investigator for ProSEDS.\nLaunched on a Delta II rocket, ProSEDS will deploy a\n3.l-mile, bare-wire tether connected with a 6.2-mile nonconducting tether from the Delta II second stage to\nlower its orbit. "More than 40 percent of launche projected over the next ten year have payloads with intended destinations beyond low-Earth orbit," said Leslie\n\nN\n\n16\n\nles Johnson of NASA Marshall inspects the nonconducting part of a\ntether as it exits a deployer similar to the system to be used in the\nProSEDS experiment.\n\nCurtis, manager of Marshall \'s Space Transfer Technologies project.

Number one is that engineers must manage and monitor CAE\nsimulation use. If you want collaboration\nbetween CAE simulation and design ,\nnever forget that the e tools were written\nfor engineers. It is up to the engineers to\nprovide interpretation 0 that a designer\ncan get value out of their use.\nOver the past decade, there\'s been a\nlot of talk about designers doing CAE directly. Yet, in our research, we continue\nto see that the mandate really is for collaboration between engineers and deigners regarding these tools, as opwww.nasatech.com\n\nposed to the desiign.;Wlllg\nrectly.

Later, the experience can be\nreused in what I call the rapid mode. If\nthis type of problem i recurring, you\nshould be able to reuse that experience.\number two is that role definition\nrou t encourage collaboration. All companie know that CAE should be done\nup front. 0 they get started on the right\nfoot, and they do CAE up front for the\nconceptual de ign. But all of a sudden,\nthey have their production schedules. So\nthey get involved with the designers,\nwho are primarily re ponsible for getting packaging out. They finally build\nthat first prototype and they test it.

For\nexample, de igner very often are meaured by how quickly they produce their\nCAD models, and CAE specialists imply\nby how quickly they perform a CAE imulation . You have to have new role defimuon and new measures of performance in order to enable collaboration.\nA designer should be re ponsible for the\nperformance of the product and components they design throughout the life\ncycle of that product.

Communicat-\n\nCAE and Collaborative Engineering:\n\number three is that CAE effectiveness must align with the business objective . Collaboration will never work\nunle it has upport of management at\nthe highe t level.\number four is that you have to have\nthe right infrastructure to enable collaboration. We\'ve been monitoring, for\nthe last ten year, the performance of\nthe e tool out in the field, and what we\nfound was from 1991, for an individual\nCAE expert, it took about 60 hours to\nperform an analy is. By 1996, becau e\nof the type of software and hardware\nenhancements that have been made,\nthat time was cut by 50% to a little over\n30 hour. And based on our reviews of\nthe e technologie over the pa t year or\n0, we expect the time to reduce by\n50% again by the year 2001 , to an average time of 16 hour.\n1 want to emphasize that collaboration doe require proce practice , or\nel e all of the oftware and hardware\ninfrastructure mean absolutely nothing. You really need to document your\nexperiences 0 that the information\ncan be reu ed. My recommendation for companies interested in collaboration acro s CAE experts and deigner are:\n22\n\nfer that to our toolmakers. Then, we\'d\ngo through the iteration of the mo t\nvalid way to design thi from the toolmaker\' tandpoint. We were looking at\nmaking thi a more collaborati e\nproce ,at least for the industrial de ign\nand engineering taff.\nOur early collaborative e ion focu ed on training, and involved our deign firm, the application engineer,\nand my elf. Generally, we pent about\ntwo hour in training, and we covered\nthe major topic of manipulating the\ngeometry. After that, we gave a pre entation to engineering management.\nketche and drawing were u ed initially to evaluate and create the concepts. The objective for the e fir t esion were to review, refine, and narrow\nit down to the final two concepts that\nactually were modeled. Those two concept de ign were selected with no prototype and models. It was definitely a\ndeviation from past methodology.\nOur later es ions were more technical - more of the component-level\nform, location, and function of the\n\nWorking Together\n\ning design concepts with outside firm\ntypically involves travel, making mockups, and going through those iterations\nof the indu trial part of the de ign. The\nother challenge was to make the design\nchanges early in the proces at the solid\nmodel level. You don\'t cut any tool, so\nyou ave the cost of tooling change .\nWe were offered the opportunity\nfrom Co-Create to be a part of their\nFast Track program, evaluating their\noftware called One pace, a web-collaboration tool that allows you to work\nwith many web clients at one time on\none single model of data, and interact\nwith that data.

These complexes are about 120\ndegrees apart in longimde to provide neady continuous coverage for deep-space missions. The Goldstone complex is located\nat the U.S. Army\'s Fort Invin Military Resen:ation in Califonua\'s\nMojave Desert; the Australian complex is near Canberra; and\nthe Spanish complex stands near Madrid. Scien tists and researchers make use of these antennas to communicate \'\'lith\nlmmanned space probes launched by NASA, the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) , and the Japanese space agencies.\nEach of the complexes has one each of the DSN\'s largest antennas, which are 70 meters in diameter. Of these antennas,\nonly Goldstone\'s transmits high-power radar signals at approximately 500,000 watts, in addition to comnnmlcation signals such\nas spacecraft commands, transmitted at 5,000 or 20,000 watts.\nThis branch of DSN Science operations is known as the\nGoldstone Solar System Radar (GSSR). The GSSR has received\nradar echoes from objects as distam as the Samm system of rings\nand moons.\nJPL recently built a\nnew hardware data\nacquisition system to\nreplace the GSSR\'s\nold system. jPL engineers used LogicDART, a portable logic probe from Hewlett~Packard, to troubleshoot the new system, which began\noperations in March\n1998. To date, the new\nsystem has improved\nthe functionality of\nthe GSSR by enabling\nits use of the DSN\'s\nnew all-digi tal receivers, providing inthe U.S.\ncreased resolution, The Goldstone complex at Reservation\nArmy\'s Fort Irwin Military\nand lowering the cost in California \'s Mojave Desert. (Image\nof operating the radar. courtesy of NASAlJPL)\nWhen the custom\nhardware system at Goldstone, controlled by a Digital\nEquipment COl-po VAX computer, was no longer cost-effective for GSSR, jPL engineers took steps to build a new system. \xc2\xb7We were using a large sel of custom hardware designed\nsome 12 years ago, and we knew its mechanical parts wouldn\'t\nlast," said Roben Frye, senior system designer atJPL. "Plus,\nwe knew that we would soon no longer receive technical sup-\n\n30\n\npon and servlCmg on our YA,,{. \'amrally, \\," decided to\ne\nbuild a modern system using embedded cpes and \\\'1\\1E card\ncages to ensure the GSSR\'s continued operability and\nexpand irs capabilirv\'"\nFrye and Chad Nikoletich, a hardware design engineer for\nJPL, built the new system, compdsed of 18 printed circuit, data\nacquisition, and correlator boards to replace\nthe slower and more\ncostly system. In operation, the new system\nprocesses radar signals\nreceived from a planet, asteroid, or comet\nvia a set of low-noise\nreceiver at the Cassegrain focus of the 70meter antenna. These\nnucrowave signals are\nthen converted down\nto lower frequencies\nand transferred first\nvia waveguide and\nthen fiber optics [0\na data acquisition\nboard. Using cOITela- The LogicDART portable logic probe.\ntor chips, the data is (Image courtesy of Hewlett-Packard)\ndigitized and sent\ntllrough custom hardware to a DSP chip. Next, software puts\nthe data through a series of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to\nobtain the spectrum of the object\'s reflected radio waves.\nWhile Nikoletich was building the system, he noticed that\na chip in one of the boards was not resetting properly. The\nboard\'s fine-pitch Circuitry made it difficult to identify the\nsource of the problem. He purchased LogicDART for ilS\ncapability of measuring voltage and frequency of signals\nfrom a single probe tip.\n"In tlle past, I\'d used a bear of a solution that included\nlarge logic analyzers and integrated scopes that also\nrequired a lengthy set-up time," explained Nikoletich. "Now,\nI have a tool that I take light out of my toolbox and use\nimmediately. I attach the LogicDART probe tip to a lead,\nand with a few keystrokes, I can compare waveforms of signals on the display within a few minutes\'"\nNikoledch tested the O.5-mm fine-pitch circuitry on the\nboards by using a magnifying glass to attach the LogicDART\nprobe tip to any lead. The LogicDART provides data visually\nwith graphic timing displays and an LED feature. "Because I\nwas looking for signal transitions during lroubleshooting,\nthe LogicDART\'s LED feature served me well," added\nNikoletich. "It blinks whenever signals change, giving me\ninstant knowledge of toggling signals. I immediately knew\nwhich clup needed repair."\nThe new system began operation early in 1998, and is currently in its acceptance phase , said Frye. "The new system\ncertainly has renovated GSSR operations with an advanced\nelectronic hardware system that takes up one-tenth of the\nspace of our previous system. The whole system TUns much\nfaster, with greater reliability and at lower cost."\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 750\n\nNASA Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nPC]\nPCMCIA\n\nSA\n232/422/485\n\nSerial\nFor 16 years, Quatech has been producing high quality data\ncommunications peripherals.

It is also used\nto describe motors that provide linear\nmotion u ing some form of internal\nrotary-to-linear conversion. But now\nCalifornia Linear Device has developed\na tubular linear motor that provide the\nrequired axial force in a simple device\nwith one moving part. This unit has\nmany applications, ranging from\nmotion control to welding, riveting,\nvibrating and driving compressors.\nWith only one moving part the inherent\nreliability i high.\nThe motor is al 0 suited to positioning applications. Through the use of a\nprecision, high-resolution encoder, one\ncan rely on detailed position information to a motion controller.\nThe basic principle on which this\nmotor operates is as follow . The linear\nmotor has a stator very similar to that of\nan induction motor. Winding are\nplaced in slots throughout the periphery. Their purpo e is to produce a moving magnetic field . The armature has a\nserie of permanent magnets that\nattempt to align themselves with thi\nmoving magnetic field. The force level\nis et by the length and diameter of the\ntator, and the troke i set by electing\nthe length of the armature.\nFigure 1 i a simplified cro\nection\nof the motor howing the armature, the\ntator with the coil , the heat rejection\nfin , and the electrical connector.\nRecently California Linear Device\nundertook a program to show that, in\nrelatively low-force material-te ting\nlIb\n\napplications, uch a imple direct-drive\nlinear motor can do a better, simpler,\nand cleaner job than a hydraulic system.\nIt was considered that in the region\nunder 2,000 lb. of force the use of a impie one-moving-part linear motor might\nbe more controllable and easier to\noperate and maintain than a hydraulic\ncontrol system. The program intended\nto demonstrate this with a goal of\n\nunder 1 % accuracy at 340 lb. force,\nwith the ability to vary the load as\ndemanded by an operator or through a\nPLC system input.\nThe motor is a DC brushless motor\nwith three sinusoidally commutated\nphases. The DC supply for the motor driver which receives this commutation\ninformation and which in turn drives the\nmotor was 300 V DC.

In open-loop operation this is\nbased on an assumption that the motor\nhas reached the position requested by\nthe controller. In clo ed-loop operation\nit i provided by the sensor position\nfeedback.\nThe motion controller used wa a\nDelta Tau PMAC2-Lite four-axi digital\ncontroller. The PMAC2 provides true\ndigital control: commutated PWM\n(pul e width modulation) output and\ndigital current-loop closure. One ervo\nchannel was used for PID position loop\ncontrol and another was used for the\nforce loop control. The servo amplifier\nused was a 3-kW Semipower Powerblok\nPWM servo amplifier.\nTo close the position loop, the required\nposition information i provided by a 1micron-resolution Renishaw optical\nencoder that read the motor armature\nposition directly. This po ition data was\nsupplied to the motion controller in\nthe form of a quadrature signal.\nThe diagram (Figure 2) illustrates how\nthe motion controller was set up for this\napplication . As can be seen, "Servo #1"\nprovides the standard position loop control. At point (A) the desired motor po ition is ummed with the actual po ition.\n"Servo #2" is et up to provide the force\nloop control. At point (B), the de ired\nforce is summed with the load signal. A\nload ceU at point (C) i u ed to measure\nthe exerted force and provides this as the\nfeedback ignal to "Servo #2". When a\ndifference (error) exists between the\nde ired force and the measured force,\nthe servo loop output, at point (D) , for\n"Servo #2" becomes non-zero. Thi ignal\nis then combined with the command\nposition of "Servo #1 " at point (E), thus\ncommanding the motor to change position until the load cell \xc2\xab ee " a force\nequivalent to the desired force.\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nU ing two alternate ways of etting the\nposition limit, one fed from the position\ncontrol loop and one from the force control loop, the motor could be driven in\nthe po ition control or the force control\nmode. This allowed the motor annature\nto be brought into contact with the work\npiece and then, switching to force control, the load to be adjusted up to the preset value. ow the load could be varied\nbased on the input request ignal. Finally,\nposition control would be used to withdraw the unit The analog force signal\nfrom the signal conditioning/ amplifier\nunit was passed through an A/ D converter and the resulting signal used as\ndescribed above.\nThis unit proved very table and was\nable to hold very tight limits on the force\napplied. At the test point of 340 lb. the\nload was held within 0.1 %. The force\ncould be varied as a function of time\nusing a PC or a PLC system such as might\nbe used in an integrated test machine.\nThe simple nature of this motor\nshould make this a flexible and reliable\napproach to strength te ting. The overall scheme, where a combination of\npositioning and force control is used in\nthis type of motor, open up a wide\nrange of combined position- and forcecontrol applications such as welding,\nriveting, various operations requiring\ncontrolled clamping, and possibly\npunching, extru ion and fluid dispensing, where a controlled force is important during part of the working cycle.\nThe engineer re ponsible for developing the control sy tern was Harry\nRivera, MSEE.\nFor more information, please contact\nGraham jones, vice president of sales and\nmarketing, at California Linear Devices\nInc., 2236 Rutherford Rd. , #119, Carlsbad,\nCA 92008; ( 760) 603-8026; fax: ( 760)\n603-0049; http://wwTII.calinear.com.\n\nMotion Control Tech Briefs,june 1999\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nMiniature DC Servo\nActuators Mini RH Series\nHD Systems offers a line of miniature DC servo\nactuators for use in applications such as robotics,\ninstrumentation, and factory automation where\nprecise motion control is required.

Many motor manufacturer now market adjustable speed controls and motion coritroller. Other\nwork from the ground up from original design. Significantly, the leading\n\nRoland S. Boreham, Jr.\nChairman\nBaldor Electric Company\n\n4b\n\ncontrols manufacturer has entered the\nmotor field.\nThe consolidation continue rapidly\nin orth America, and globally as well.\nWe at Baldor Electric and many others\nbelieve this is a healthy trend, becau e it\nbenefits users of both motors and controls. Also, it is definitely to the benefit\nof designers of systems incorporating\nmotors and controls. One important reason is compatibility:\nthough using components from\none manufacturer doe not guarantee compatibility, it certainly\nimproves the odds for ucce .\nThere is al 0 the important\nubject of re ponsibility. A look at\nthe history of the e indu tries will\niIIu trate thi .\nElectric motor have been\nimportant to indu try for more\nthan one hundred year, and have\nbecome a medium-sized indu try\nof approximately 10 billion dollar per year in orth America,\nand two or three time this large\nglobally.\nA econd industry, known by\nmany name but which we\'ll refer\nto as indu trial control, was born\noon after. A large percentage of\nthese controls were designed and\nused originally to start and top\nmotors. Then later, in some cases,\nwww.nasalech .com\n\nthere were many different way to\nadjust the speed of motors, usually\ndirect-current motors. In fact, one of\nThomas Edi on\' reasons for upporting the u e of DC motor rather than\nAC motors was their controllability.\nThese old controls were mo t1yelectromechanical. Power electronics, including\nthe old thyratron and other devices,\ngradually took over some of these applications, ometimes improved their performance, and often lowered co ts.\nUntil 1960, most industrial-motor\nspeed controls were large, heavy, and\nexpensive. An exception was the military u e of servo. With the invention of\nthe silicon-controlled rectifier ( CR) in\nthe late 1950 at Bell Labs, the ability to\ncontrol indu trial motors rapidly\nincreased (Figure 1).\nThe CR opened up much better\nways to adjust output DC voltage to the\nmotor armature and control the peed\nof shunt-wound or compound-wound\nD motors. More than 100 manufacturers of CR control sprang up around\nthe world . The e control were gradually adopted by most industrial establishments a well a\nome commercial\nen terprises.\nMany were not atisfied, however.\nMany u er would have preferred controlling AC motor rather than DC\nmotors. This preference often resulted\nMotion ConLroI Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nfrom the belief-sometimes true, sometimes\nnot-that DC motor\nrequired much more\nmaintenance.\nThen, referring again\nto Figure 1, along came\nthe inverter in the mid1970s. Early models had\nmany disadvantages. They\nwere much hea\\ier, larger, and more costly-at\nleast double and more\noften triple-than an\nSCR control of a similar\nsize. They also had less\nspeed range and lacked\ntorque controllability.\nIn any event, this situation gave designers and\nusers of these components a choice they had\nnot previously experienced. Some liked DC\nand some liked AC.\nGradually the costs came Figure 1.\nto be quite similar, with\nthe DC motor costing more but the DC\ncontrol less, and the AC control costing\nmore but the AC motor less.\nImproved performance led to brushless DC motors in the 1980s. "Brushless\nDC" is really a misnomer, for these are\nreally AC motors. They were dubbed\nbrush less DC because they perform like\nDC motors, but usually with a wider\nspeed range, better speed regulation,\nand some advantages not always available with AC controls. In Europe they\nare referred to as AC servo motor . The\ncontrols are much more complex than\nSCR controls, and the motors are more\nexpensive than conventional AC induction motors by a factor of two or three.\nThe closed-loop flux vector controls,\ndeveloped experimentally in the 1980s\nand coming into more widespread use\nin the 1990s, solved many problems.\nThe flux vector control is referred to by\nlaymen as "the first AC control that performs as well as DC." It yields the wide\nspeed range of a DC/SCR, and can also\nproduce full torque at zero speed. The\nmotor response is also very good, and\nwide speed ranges, from zero with full\ntorque up to two, three, or four times\nthe de ign peed of the connected AC\nmotor, are available.\nWhile these de ign improvements\nwere well accepted by sy tem designers\nand users, there were stiU orne problems to be solved. One was "ringing" of\nvoltage buildup in long lines between\nthe concrol and the mowr. The longer\ntlle cable be\xc2\xa3ween the two, the larger\nthe problem. Also, compatibility continued to be a problem, although nOl\nMotion Control Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nto the extent it had been in the 1970s\nand 19805.\nThis led inevitably to the invention of\nBaldor\'s "SmartMotor."TM As the name\nimplies, this is a motor with the electronics and magnetics built as one unit.\n\nCompatibility problems disappeared,\nand of course, ringing was no longer a\nfactor. Also, SmartMotors allow the\nmachinery designer to design a truly\nself-contained and self-sufficient piece\nof equipment.\nContinued\n\nUneor & Rotary Motor Series\nFrom .5" to 1.8" diameter - HSI has the thrust\nand torque ratios you want, in a variety of.. .\n.captiveornon~ptiveshafts\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 linear, rotary. oscillating, pancake designs & XY Tables\n\nOn-site, rapid tum-around response teoms\nPrototypes?

Figure 2 shows the difference in\nenergy requirements between running a\npump at reduced flow using a standard\n\nmotor as oppo ed to using\nan adjustable-speed drive. At\n50 percent flow requirement the energy saving is\napproximately 50 percent.\nCon idering that a very\nlarge proportion of industrial motors-some say as high\nas 30 or 40 percent-are\nu ed to run pumps, and that\nmotors in total use 58 percent of all electricity generated in the United States, it\nis apparent that the potential energy saving using\nadjustable-speed drives is\ntremendous.\nAnother common use of\nmotors is to move air with\nblowers, fans, and so forth,\nand the same cube rule, of\ncourse, applies here just as it\ndoes to centrifugal pumps.\nTherefore the energy saving\nis quite similar to that of\nFigure 2. Considering that motors often\nuse ten times their cost in electricity per\nyear, it is apparent that even minor\nimprovements from the use of more\nefficient motors and adjustable-speed\ncontrols yield absolutely tremendous\nsavings in energy and dollars.\n\n~ Hewpart\'s 1m. and raIIry . . .\n\n. .

These motors\nare suitable for numerous precision linear motion applications, including\nrobotics and Laboratory automation.\nThe special technical qualities of\nthese linear motors can be summarized\nas follow : they can be freel y positioned; they have an electronic cam\ndisc function; extreme accelerations\nare possible (>200 m / se(2 ) ; cyclical\nmovement frequencies can be greater\nthan 10 Hz; they are dependable, even\nin harsh industrial environments; and\nthey have high life expectancy.\nIn com pari on , pneumatic solution\ncannot be freely positioned, and their\ndynamics do not offer comparable values. The free programmability of\nLinMot P is a particular advantage over\npurely mechanical components such as\nlever or cam discs.\nWith LinMot P, the speed of movement can be freely chosen, and other\nposition , movement profiles, or modes\nof operation pre et by clicking a mouse.\nLinMot P movement profiles and movement equence are defined by oftware\nand performed immediately.

Control engineers are\nquickly dropping their proprietary PLC boxes and replacing\nthem with PC-based control systems to gain the benefits of opensystems architecture. Similar to the shift away from proprietary\nWang and Sperry-Univac mainframe systems to PCS in the office,\nthe shift on the factory floor is equally dramatic. The drivers of\nthis migration are pure business benefits: cost-effective integration of off-the-shelf hardware and software solutions; lower overall system costs; control system design cycles cut in half; enterprise-wide connectivity; and easier-to-use systems.\nPC-based control combines the functions of several separate\nplatforms into a single PC. This includes the runtime control\nengine, the programming and monitoring tools, the graphical\noperator interface, the data collection, alarming, and storage\ntraditionally performed by the SCADA node, real-time simulation, and Windows DDE, DLL, or COM/ DCOM data servers.\nBeyond the obvious cost savings that result from eliminating\nan expensive proprietary PLC and several PCS, there are a number of technical factors that should be evaluated when moving\nto a PC-based control system:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hard real-time control;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Eliminating the multiple database trap;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mix & match, commodity I/O;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Off-the-shelf hardware and software components; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advanced, easier-to-use Windows-based programming tools.\nThere are five fundamental rules of PC-based control that\nmust be met to replace a PLC:\n1. Must provide deterministic operation. Control must be treated as the highest priority and ensure a predictable, repeatable\nresponse.\n2. Must survive a Windows crash . A machine control program\nmust survive a General Protection Fault in Windows, or the\n"Blue Screen of Death" in Windows NT, and continue to operate in a safe manner.\n3. Must be isolated from poorly behaved Windows applications\nand drivers. The control system cannot be adversely affected\nby unstable Wmdows NT applications or drivers.\n4. Must survive a hard disk crash. It is essential that deterministic control not be interrupted in the event that a hard di k\ncrashes or is removed. If the hard drive in the PC fails, the\nreal-time control must continue to execute.\n5. Must be based on a proven real-time engine. The control\nengine must have a proven track record in mission-critical\napplications.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwww smalley. com \xe2\x80\xa2 e-ma,l \' onlo (Ol smalley.com\n\nlOb\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 612\n\nRial-T ime Conl r olEnglne\n\nFigure 1. PC-based Control Architecture with common database.\nMotion Comrol Tech Briefs, june 1999\n\nHard real-time control is the technology that is required to meet the e rules. As\nopposed to "Soft Logic," which runs a\nPLC emulator under Wmdows NT, hard\nreal-time control couple the core of a\nPLC-a real-time operating system-with\nWindows NT on the same PC. Because\nWindows NT is completely isolated from\nthe PLC core, Windows NT can "blue\nscreen" or the hard drive can fail, and the\ncontrol system keep running.\nOne of the key benefits of Windows\nPCbased control software is the elimination of the multiple databases required to\nsupport a PLC system. Because the software incorporates the functions of the\nPLC, the programming PC, and the\noperator interface and provides real-time\ndata access to other software applications\nrunning in Windows, a single common\ndatabase can be used across all of the\ntools (see Figure 1).\nEach element of the software can\naccess the same database with a single set\nof tag names. I/O points are configured\nand given tag names once, and the same\ntag name is used throughout all of the\nsoftware applications. The most important benefit of using the single tag in PC\nbased control systems is the elimination\nof human error.\nAnother key advantage of PCbased\ncontrol is its ability to support multiple\nPLC I/O types. With an I/O scanner\ncard, the PC can connect to and scan\nmost industrial I/O. Examples of typical\nI/O families include Allen-Bradley\'s\nRemote I/O, Genius I/O, and Modicon\nRemote I/O. Open device-level buses\ninclude Interbus-S, Device eL, Sman\nDistributed System, and Profibus. A PC\nbased controller can mix several different I/O families in the same PC by simply installing scanner cards for each\nI/O family.\nAn even more powerful feature of PC\nbased control is the ability to switch I/O\nfamilies, comparable to changing printers in Windows. A system designed for a\nparticular I/O family can be changed to\nuse a different I/O family through a simple drop-down box.\nManufacturers make a ignificant\ninvestment in developing their applications and processes, and recognize that\nthis investment must be protected. To\n"future-proof\' their investment, they are\ninterested in using platforms that will\nsupport their investment into the future.\nThe research and development dollars\nalone spent in the 20O-billion PC industry exceed the total revenue of the 4-billion PLC industry.\nOne of the mo t ignificant advance\nintroduced with PCbased control is\ngraphical flowchart programming.\nFlowcharts offer a simple, intuitive\nMotion Control Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\ngraphical de cription of a proce that\nis used and understood by nearly everyone on the factory floor. A common\nlanguage allow engineers, operators,\nand electrician to easily interpret flowcharts that describe the step-by-step\nprocess to program, operate, or troubleshoot a machine.\nFlowchart blocks de cribe the mouon\nas simple function calls. These can be\nplaced inside the flowchart logic (Figure\n2) and can describe in written Engli h\nhow the motion\nprogrammed.\nCommands such a\n"Jog," "Axis\nSymmetrical Move," and "Axis Relative\nMove" can be dropped in place.\n\nS\n\nConfiguring the motion blocks becomes\nas simple as filling out parameters in a\ndialog box such as axis, po ition, acceleration / deceleration rate, and velocity.\nWith teeplechase Software \' patentpending flowchart-enhanced ladder\nlogic, the same motion blocks defined for\nflowchart programming can also be\ndropped direct! into ladder-logic rungs.\nControl\ntern de ign time can be\nreduced by 50 to 70 percent using PC\nbased control and flowchart programming, compared \\\\ith traditional PLC\ndesign lIsing relay ladder logic.

With a\ngraphical, step-by-step sequencing of the machine\'s operation,\nit becomes easier to read, understand, and improve the\n\noperation of the machine.\nAs P\nhave become more widely\naccepted in the manufacturing environment, a number of advance have\ntaken place to add motion control\ncapabilitie to the PC. mart servo\ntern using high-speed PID algorithms are built right into PC interface cards.

All five\nrules of PC-based control cited above\ncan be extended to motion control.\nThe common tag database can be\nexpanded to include the motion conconfigurations.\ntrol parameters. By integrating the\nmotion database with the re t of the PC-based control database,\nthe motion parameters and data are directly accessible from the\ncommon programming environment, MMI, and other Windows\napplications either through DDE/ DLL/COM/ DCOM interfaces or over the network to remote PC applications. All of the\nbenefits of a common tag database can now be expanded to\ninclude motion control on the PC.\nThere are a number of applications where PC control can be\napplied for simple single-axis and multiaxis motion control.\nThe e include gantry material handling, X-Y-Z overhead crane\ncontrol, electronic component pick-and-place controls, and\nsingle-axis feed to length applications where material is fed\nfrom a roll into a press to be formed and cut.

When\nthi did not happen in many case, vi ion\ncame to be perceived as a mysteriou solution that had promised to improve\nmanufacturing quality, but often could\nnot deliver on this promise.\nWhy did the initial vision product offerings fail to deliver on their promise in\nthe manufacturing arena? Why, during\nthe past couple of years, has machine vision uddenly caught hold and pread\nrapidly in the manufacturing environment? After suggesting a few answers to\nthese questions, we\'ll look at new low-end\nvision technologies dlat are making machine vision an attractive option for every\ntype of manufacturer, from OEM to end\nuser, from large companies to small, for\nthose people \\vith previous vision experience, to those who have none.\n\nW\n\nWhy Did Vision\nFail to Take Hold?\nOne of the primary reasons that\nmachine vision failed in many manufacturing environments wa due\nnot to the technology itself; radler, it\nwas due to lack of u er understanding of machine vision concepts,\nsetup, and programming terminology. Most machine vision systems\nwere complex and required extensive programming time. In addition,\nmany user did not realize that machine vision as it then existed was as\nmuch an art form as a technology,\none that relied on unique solutions\nmethodology combined \\vith custom\nlighting and optic. U ers who expected vision to be a quick cure-all\nwere disappointed, and those who\nrealized that extensive training and\nexperimentation were required to\nset up a reliable system for their application, sometimes teered away\n[rom it as a result.\nAnother reason that manufacturer were reluctant to implement vi36\n\nion was due to its high price. With vision ystem typically ranging from\n15,000 to 100,000, user were unwilling and unable, to inve t large amounts\nof money in a technology they did not\nunderstand.\nOther factors affecting manufacturers\' deci ions not to use vision in the\npast included the proprietary nature of\nthe system, which offered limited or no\nability to communicate with other automation products. Another factor was\nthe lack of flexibility of the systems,\nwhich required extensive re-programming whenever a different part was\nbeing inspected.\n\nnical staffs are demanding solutions that\nare ea ier to under tand and use. Because their taffs are spread so thin,\ncompanies can no longer afford to have\ntheir employees pend days, or even\nweeks, learning how to use complex viion y tems, and they are less willing to\npay big money for dleseystems. They\nal 0 are not willing to pay for the vision\nexperti e necessary for programming,\nlighting, and lensing. And, as customers\ncontinue to demand higher-quality\nproducts, manufacturer are looking for\nlow-cost, easy-to-use, flexib le inspection\nsolutions that they can incorporate\nthroughout the various stages of their\nmanufacturing processes.\nWhy is Vision Gaining\nPC-based vision has addressed some of\ndlese user needs. The same PC that i\nAcceptance?\nA combination of factor is cau ing\nused for word proces ing and sending eboth manufacturers and users of vision\nmail has become fast enough to solve violutions to realize that there is a great\nsion applications. Relative to most proneed for low-cost, easy-to-use vision soluprietaJ.]\' systems, PC-based vision offers\ntions.

PC-based vision is\nalso lower in co t dlan many traditional proprietary vision systems,\nwhich can cost in excess of $100,000.\nAnd PC-based vision offers great\nfunctionality in terms of simple connection to standard communications\nlike Edlernet, and in telms of dle reporting and analy i functionality it\nprovides.\nLike traditional proprietary vision\nsystems, PC-based vision typically addresses high-end user needs. The e\nhigh-end systems provide a range of\nsolutions, from imple to complex,\nfrom general to application-specific.\nTypical prices for PC-based systems\n(excluding any integration fees)\nrange from 13,000 to 50,000.\nBut what about dle many users who\ndo not need a highly functional vision system that integrates easily with\nother automation systems?

Is the part oriented properly?\nOmron has pioneered a new breed of\nmachine vision sensors to address the\nniche between photoelectric sensors,\nwhich cannot see two dimensions, and\ntraditional vision systems, which are\noften overkill for basic inspection applications. These vision ensors require no\nu er programming; applications are easily configured and re<onfigured via a\nhandheld console or selection buttons\nlike those found on many photoelectric\nsensors. Lighting, which is often the mo t\ndifficult aspect of configuring an application, is built into the system, implifying etup so that even inexperienced vision users can have an application up\nand running within minutes.\n\nThe Technology Inside\nHow was a highly complex technology\nirnplified and incorporated into such\nan easy-to-use interface? We basically reengineered the technology found in our\nhigh-end vision system, reducing the\ncomplexity and functionality of certain\ncomponents to produce a maller, faster,\neasier-to-use and much Ie co tly quality\nassurance system. Looking at our FlO viion en or as an example, the vision\nen or incorporates both a true\ngray cale camera and a high-technology\ngray cale algorithm known as normalized correlation that was adapted from a\nASA Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nI Interface I\nHuman\n\n_Object\nIllumination\n\n1/0\n\nI Action I\nHuman\n\nExtemal\nControl\n(ex.

This normalized correlation algorithm compares an\nimage being inspected against what it\nhas stored in memory to see if the patterns match.\nThe FlO consists of an amplifier and a\nsensor head that look very similar to\nthose of a photoelectric sen or. What is\nit that happens inside that makes a vision sensor different from a photoelectric sensor? (See figure above.) The ensor head contains a camera, lens, and\nring light all in one 70 x 33 x 33mm\npackage. A visible green or blue LED\ngenerates the search area for the user to\nsee what he or she i inspecting. A halfmirror between the light source and the\nlens allows light to shine through the\nlens to project the search area so the\nuser can see what i being inspected.\nThe image is reflected up through the\nlen to the half-mirror, then reflected 90\ndegree to the CCD element. The visible\nLED light guide enables users to simply\nteach the FlO to recognize certain patterns (a logo, for example). The user\nthen pre es a teach button to register\nthe pattern in the ensor, runs a sample\ntest, and adju ts thre hold levels if\nneeded via an up or down select button.\nThe S} tern is then ready 00 run an application.\nSince it detects patterns (rather than\nspots. as photoelectric ensors do), it enwww.nasatech.com\n\nEEPROM\n\nCPU Bus\n\nt\n\n_CCD\nElement\n\nI\n\n~\n\n(\n\nI\n\nI\n\n~\n\n)\n\nI Converter I\nDC-DC\n\nDC Power\nSource\n\nI\n\nabies a wider range of applications.

The instrument exploits the\nknown spectral-reflectance characteIistics\nassociated with the chlorophyll contents\nof healthy and unhealthy plants. In particular, the instrument indicates the ratio\nbetween the reflectances of plan ts in narrow spectral bands centered at wavelengths of 700 and 840 nm, respectively.\nThis ratio ranges from about 0.1 for a\nhealthy plant to ~0.4 for an unhealthy\nplant. [Other similar instrwnents have\nbeen ba ed on fluorescence (as distinguished from reflectance) ratios, but the\nintensity of reflected light is much\ngreater than fluorescence intensity at the\nwavelengths used in this instrument.]\nThe instrument is operated in the following procedure: Reading are first\n\ntaken with the instrument aimed at a\nstandard reflectance target. ext, reading are taken with the instrument aimed\nat the plants o(interest. Both the plants\nand the target could be illuminated by\nsunlight or artificial light. From time to\ntime, readings are also taken in the dark\nto obtain corrections for nonzero components of photo de tector outputs ("dark\ncurrents") at zero illumination.\nIn the instrument (see figure), light\nreflected from the plants or target i intercepted by a lens, then split into two\nbeams. One beam i band-pass .filtered at\na wavelength of 700 nm , the other at a\nwavelength of 840 nm. Each beam then\nimpinges on a photodetector, which is\nlocated with the center of its input face\nat a focal point of the lens.\nThe outputs of the photodetectors are\namplified and offset as needed. A 2:1\nmultiplexer selects whichever of the two\n\namplified, offset photodetector outputs\ni to be fed to a sample-and-hold (S/ H)\namplifier followed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) . A rnicrocontroller\ncontrols the multiplexer, the S/ H amplifier, and the ADC. The digital sample\nput out by the ADC is fed to the microcontroller for further digital processing\nin coordination with the acquisition of\nsamples, as described next.\nWith the insu\'ument aimed at the reflectance target, the operator presses a\npushbutton switch marked "reference,"\ncausing the microproces or to command the acquisition of a digital sample,\nfirst at the wavelength of 700 nm, then at\nthe wavelength of 840 nm.

The reduction in weight and\ncost, relative to biplates now used in\nmethanol fuel cells, would be achieved\nby u e of a combination of modified\ngeometry, cheaper and lighter material ,\nand cheaper manufacturing proce e.\nA typical methanol fuel cell includes a\nnumber of membrane/ electrode as emblies (MEAs) stacked in alternation with\nbiplates. Each biplate serves (1) partly a\nan electrical contact between the cathode of the MEA on one side and the\nanode of the MEA on the other side, (2)\npartly as a fue l-and-oxidizer-delivery\nmanifold, (3) partly as an exhaust manifold, and (4) partly as a heat exchanger\nto remove waste heat. The biplate contains channels for circulating air past the\ncathode, plus other channels for circulating the fuel olution (methanol dissolved in water) pa t the anode. The\nflowing aqueous methanol olution ,\nwhich is 97 weight percent water, can be\nused to remove the waste heat.\nH eretofore, biplates in methanol fuel\ncells have been fabricated by machining\nthem out of graphite. About one-third of\nthe cost of a typical methanol cell is incurred in conjunction with the machined grap hite biplate (s). In addition,\ngraphite has a density of about 2.0,\nwhereas some other materials that could\nbe used in biplates have lower densitie .\nTh us, if one could reduce the costs ofbiplates and make them of less-dense materials (plastics) , one could effect ignificant reductions in the costs and weights\nof methanol fuel cell .\nO ne reason for using graphite until\nnow is that graphite has the required\nelectrical conductivity. A plastic biplate\n\nb itself would not be electricall conductive, but the de ign could be modified to use electrically conductive pin\ninserted tllfough the thickne of the biplate to provide electrical contact between the anode on one side and the\ncathode on the other ide. The modified\ndesign would feature a "pincu \'hion"\nflow-field configuration; the channels\non the cathode and anode side would\nbe defined by the pins, which would disper e the flow of fuel and air over the\nelectrode (see figure) .\nThe main body of the biplate, with\nits channel and hole , could be\n\nmolded. To obtain the required fluid\neal around the pins, the main body\ncould be molded around the pins. A\nuitable material for the main body of\nthe plate might be mineral-filled phenolic, (better known by the trade name\n"Bakelite"), which has a d ensity of 1.3.\nWhile the graphite pin would increase\nthe average density a bit, the average\ndensity would still be con iderably Ie\nthan that of a biplate made solely of\ngraphite .\nThis work was done by Andrew Kindler of\nCaltech far NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Improved Aerogel-Based Thermal\nInsulation Systems\nThermal conductivities are generally lower than\nthose achieved previously.\nJohn F. Kennedy space Center; Florida\n\nConnect PC\'s Parallel Port\nCable To LPTek\'s\nInterface Bd .\n\n~--------\n\n~----~\n\nImproved aerogel-ba ed thermal insulation ystems have been developed to\nprovide cost-effective and easier-to-handle alternatives to various type of multilayer insulation (MLI) and evacuated\npowder insulation now u ed on cryogenic equipment. The apparent thermal\nconductivitie of the aerogel-based systems are comparable to MLI systems and\nare well below the thermal conductivities of the other systems.\nMLI systems are expensive, truCturally\ncomplex, and bulky; the insulating properties are anisotropic; and maintaining a\nhigh vacuum [10-4 to 10-5 torr (about 10-2\nto 10-3 Pa)] is required in MLI for full insulating effectiveness. Evacuated powder\ninsulation is about one order of magnitude less effective than is MLI, but its insulating properties are isotropic, it is generally easier to install, and it re~uires only a\nmoderate vacuum [10-2 to 10- torr (about\n1 to 10-1 Pa)] to realize its full insulation\npotential. Unfortunately, the powder in\nevacuated powder insulation tends to settle in response to vibration and thermal cycling, forming voids that act as heat leaks.\nT he improved aerogel-based insulation\nsystems are composites which can be manufactured in blanket, sleeve, or clamshell\nforms to be used with or without evacuation. These composite systems take advantage of the low thermal conductivity of\nthe ultra-Iow-density aerogels to minimize\nheat transfer and incorporate a flexib le,\ndurable matrix to maximize applicability.\nThe core of the system is aerogels formed\nat the fiber-fiber contacts of the matrix,\nforcing solid heat-transfer to occur\nthrough the aerogels. This composite\nconfiguration improves both the ease of\nhandling aerogels and the overall thermal\n\nre istance. The clo ed-packed structure of\nthe aerogels eliminate the open space in\nthe fiber matrix and thereby minimizes\nconvection heat transfer. Excellent thermal resistance has been achieved for both\nevacuated and nonevacuated in ulation\nsystems while maintaining good flexibility.\nThe aerogels can also be produced in an\nopacified fiber matrix to inhibit radiation\nheat transfer in the infrared range.\nA typical insulating system for use on\ncryogenic equipment is an integrated, layered structure that includes a backing layer\non the cold side and protective layers on\nthe warm side (see figure). One of the protective layers is a tightly woven fabric coated\nwith polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) ,\nwhich serve as a vapor barrier to prevent\ncondensation of moisture. Multiple layers\nof polyester foil coated with aluminum\nserve as radiation shields and give additional protection from the environment\nAn outer layer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)\nin the form of pipe or a foil jacket provides\nsecondary protection from the environment and protection against mechanical\nimpacts. This system can be designed as a\nfully flexible blanket type configuration or\na pre-formed molded type configuration\nfor installation on a variety of cryogenic\nstorage and transfer equipment.\nThis work was done by James E.

Our participation has largely\nbeen in the areas of technical oversight\nand range safety, but the X-36 program\nprovided an opportunity to get some\n"stick and throttle" experience in this\nvery unique type of flying. It was also an\nexcellent o pportunity to evaluate first\nhand the elements which make a successful UAV test program. I participated\nin the program as part of an independent review team, a chase pilot, and as a\nproject pilot. In ovember 1997, I piloted two parameter-identification and\nflight-envelope-expansion orties - they\nproved to be some of the most intense\nflight testing of my career.\nThe X-36 is a 28-percent scale, remotely piloted research aircraft (see\nfigure) designed to develop tailless,\nhigh angle of attack fighter agility with\na stealth design. It uses a control system consisting of canards, split\nailerons, leading and trailing edge\nflaps , and thrust vectoring. The aircraft\nlength is nearly 18 ft (5.5 m) , the\nwingspan is about 11 ft (3.4 m) and the\ntakeoff weight is approximately 1,250\nlb (567 kg). It is powered by a Williams\nInternational F-1l2 turbojet engine\nwith approximately 700 lb (318 kg\xc2\xa3) of\nthrust. The flight operations were conducted from a control trailer, which\ncontained both control-room stations\nand the pilot cockpit.\nThe cockpit controls and displays\nwere designed to emulate a standard\nfighter type aircraft cockpit. The controls included a displacement stick,\nrudder pedals, a throttle quadrant, and\nseveral instrument-panel pushbutton\nswitches. All normal flight functions\ncould be controlled from the buttons\non the stick and throttle (HOTAS). Two\n20-in. (O.51-m) color displays were used\nto display information. One had the\n"out-the-no e" picture from the onboard video camera, with heads-up display (HUD) symbology overlaid to obASA Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\ntain a true 1: 1 correlation with the\nvideo imager . The econd screen had a\nmap indicating the location of the aircraft in the te t area and numerou system- tatu and warning indicators. Finally, a microphone located inside the\naircraft provided some valuable audio\ninformation on aircraft systems and engine performance.\nPiloting the X-36 is an intensely visual\ntask. Gone are the large field of regard,\nthe subtle "seat-of-the-pants" inputs and\nnumerous audio due which normall\nallow the te t pilot to have better situational awareness than anyone else on the\nte t team. In tead, the pilot must rely on\na rapid and focused cross check of\nhis/her displays and precise communications with the test conductor. To aid\nconcentration, the pilot was isolated\nfrom the rest of the control room area\nby a curtain and his communications\nwere restricted to the flight director and\nradio traffic using a separate "flight\nloop" intercom etup. Behind the pilot\nwas a position which allowed another\npilot/ engineer to view the displays. This\nposition proved useful for both pilot\ntraining and for providing "copilot type"\nassistance to the flying pilot.\nThe display symbology needed to\nmeet two conflicting requirements. First,\nit had to provide enough information to\nthe pilot, in an intuitive fonnat, to compensate for the lack of audio and physical cues discussed previously. Second,\nthe symbology needed to be uncluttered\nenough to allow the pilot to fmd and ases quickly key flight parameters. During rapid maneuvering, it was often desired to track airspeed angle of attack,\nbank angle, and normal acceleration\nprecisely, while looking for any indication of sideslip or angle-of-attack excurion, engine-compre or stalls, and the\nlike. The X-36 symbology wa developed\nprimaril by the chief contractor pilot\nand reflected hi experience with F-15\nand F-18 aircraft. I found the symbology\nvery complete, but often too cluttered\nand a Large portion of my training was\ndevoted to finding the correct cro\ncheck for each maneuver block. The tailoring of symbology is an i ue in all\ntypes of aircraft, but for an RPA, the correct symbology et is often critical to\nflight safety and mission succe .\nThe key to m ucce s with these ortie was the 10 hour of high-fidelity\nimulation training I obtained prior to\nan actual takeoff. I ~piloted" the aircraft\nfrom the actual RP cockpit with the\nmo t current aircraft model and a imulated out-the-nose visual presentation.\nBoth normal and emergency operations were practiced until I was proficient. The imulator training culm iNASA Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nnated in a full te t mlS Ion practice\nprior to the actual flight. Additional\ntraining included an actual engine tart\nand a high-speed taxi test [0 70 kn on\nthe lakebed runway.\nThe test flights do ely followed the\nimula[Or training. The takeoff was accompli hed from lakebed runway 15\nand the aircraft quickly climbed into the\ntest airspace. Basic aircraft control was\neasily accomplished using the HUD symbology and the video image. The test\nmaneuvers included a erie of controltick and rudder-pedal rolling maneuver at variou airspeeds and angle of attack. Several level accelerations were\n\naccompli hed to expand the peed envelope of the aircraft. The aircraft exhibited excellent flying qualities throughout the flight All the rolls were rapid\nand the bank-angle/angle-of-attack targets were preci ely tracked. The aircraft\nwas able [0 change peed rapidly, and\nthe lack of an audio or phy ical speed\ncues required the pilot to pend extra\nattention to this display.\nPerhaps the most challenging part of\nthe flight was the landing pattern. Airpace restrictions forced u to use a continuou turn to final which meant that\nthe runway was not in ight until very\nlate in the approach.

Year of\nflight test experience have defined a\nset of "flight test be t practice." Simp ly stated, these embody the attitude\nand the processes which have proven\nto be critical to mission succe s. A few\nof the key points are:\n1. Robust Designs and Quality Construction - A major "benefit" of going with\na UAV is the ability to implify the sy terns of the vehicle. However, imple,\nnonredundant systems demand careful design to reduce the effect of failures. A "graceful degradation" of system performance is desired. Critical\n"single string" systems ( uch as flight\ncontrols) are only ucces ful when\nsupported by high-quality parts and\nconstruction. "Off-the-shelf" technologies which are integrated into a\nnew vehicle do not in ure low-risk\nflight operations.\n2. Hazard Analysis - The failure of the\nAV prior to meeting its mission objective i unacceptable. The hazard\nanalysis must properly identity the\nprobability and the everity of the\nhazards the vehicle may encounter.\nOnce identified, steps must be taken\nto mitigate each of the hazards to the\nlowest level po sible. Only then can\nthe program present to management\nthe true level of risk that mu t be accepted during flight test.\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 431\n\nwww.nasalech.com\n\nNumerical AlgorHhms Group\n1400 Opus PI., Suite 200\n\nDowners Grove, IL 60515\n\nN~~\n\nPh: (630) 971-2337\nFax: (630) 971 -2706\n\nAI 0, the program must avoid the\n"expendabili ty mind-set," which accepts that UAVs fail at a higher rate\nthan other aircraft This attitude may\nresult in accepting a ub tandard system or procedure.

Test Planning and Test Mission Conduct - Programs need to recognize\nthat flight te t personnel can make\nvaluable inputs to the design of the\nentire sy tern. Often, the best engineering choice is the one which sati fies the operational requirements for\nthe vehicle, and the flight te ter u ually has the most experience in this\narea.

In\ncomparison with traditional fuekell MEAs made partly from a\ncommercial perfluorosulfonic acid-based polymer, these MEAs\nperform similarly, but cost much less.\nPrior to the development reported here, MEAs made partly\nfrom HSPES did not perform as well as did the traditional ones.\nAnalysis of polarization data for an HSPE~based MEA revealed\nthat losses in the cathode accounted for the loss in performance.\nFurther analysis guided by previous experience led to the conclusion that the loss in performance was caused by poor utilization of\nthe cathode catalyst Thl conclusion, in tum, led to dle conjecture that performance might be improved by use of a modified\nfabrication process that would yield a modified cathode tructure,\nwherein the cathode catalyst would be bonded in an improved\nway and distributed in different structures, such that a greater proportion of the catalyst loading would participate in electrochemical reactions.\nIt was conjectured, further, that the best way to inlprove bonding and reduce migration was to inlmobilize some of the catalyst\nprior to a hot-pressing step that is part of the MEA-fabrication\nprocess. In a previous version of the process, a paint containing\npolytetrafluoroethylene, water, and triton was applied to carbon\npaper and sintered at a temperature of 350 \xc2\xb0e under a nitrogen\nblanket; this immobilized the catalyst. A solution of the perfluorosulfonic acid-based polymenvas then applied to the catalyst<O\\t.\nered electrode before hot pressing. One of the goals pursued in\nthe developmen t of this previous version was of the process to obtain adequate performance with a catalyst loading reduced from\nthe value (4 mg/ em!) of the traditional MEAs. The catalyst loading achieved was 1 mg/ cm2, but, as stated above, performance ,vas\nbelow that of traditional MEAs.\nIn the modified prace ,the catalyst loading is not reduced\nfrom that of traditional MEAs. However. the catalyst is applied in\ntwo layer, each containing half (2 mg/em2) of the total cataly t\nloading. The fir l half of the catalyst is applied as in the previous\n\\\'ersion of the process and intered at 350 \xc2\xb0e, but unlike in the\nprevious version of the proc ,the perfluorosulfonic acid-based\npol}mer is not applied after sintering. The second half of the calal t loading is applied as part of a paint that also contains water\nand the perfluorosulfonic acid-based pol)mer. nlike the first\nlayer, the second layer i not sintered. Instead, the MEA is hotpressed after application of the second layer.\nThe two-layer ca.t hode catalytic trucrure offers ad\\-antage o\\\'er\nthe previous ingle-sintered-Iayer cathode catalytic tructure:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The high imering temperature can reduce the aCli\\ity of the\ncatalyst As a re ult of the placement of the unsintered layer\noyer me intered one, highly active catal "t is in direct contact\nwim the membrane after hot pres ing.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Quasi-sin tering of polytetrafluoroedlylene can reduce catal} t\nacti\\ity by covering otherwise active catal)tic ites. Howe\\\'er, the unsintered layer contains no polyt.etrafluoroethylene. Because the unintered layer becomes bonded to the membrane, the lower catalytic activity of the sintered layer becomes less important For this\nASA Tech Briefs, T 1999\nune\n\nreason, it might be possible to increase the polytetrafluoroethylene\ncontent of the sintered layer to improve the barrier to migration.\nThe performances of an HSPBbased MEA made by the modified process (improved MEA) and of one made by the previous\nyersion of the process were measured in a comparative test At a\ncurrent density of 300 mAl cm\', the MEA made by the previous\nversion of me process exhibited a potential of 212 mY, whereas\nthe improved MEA exhibited a potential of 387 mV.\nThis work was done by Andrew Kindler and Shiao\xc2\xb7,ping Yen of Caltech\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

These\nVespel\' inserts protect and cover vulnerable\nanodized areas of the plate. Manufacturers\nhave found that plates with Vespel" last up\nto seven times longer than plates made\nwithout them.\n\nContamination Reduction\nCompared to other polymers, Vespel" components are exceptionally clean. They also offer enhanced plasma resistance. And\nbecause Vespel" parts have very low thermal conductivity,\nthey don\'t collect deposits as readily as other\nmaterials, which increases cleanliness inside\nsemiconductor processing chambers.\n\nQuartz Replacement\nIn a variety of semiconductor applications, Vespel\' has several\nadvantages over quartz. It minimizes particles\nin the etching process and virtually eliminates f\ndeposition problems in-chamber. In many\nprocesses, Vespel" has improved etch uniformity.\n\nWafer Clamping Rings\nOver the years, Vespel\' has been the proven\nmaterial in wafer clamping rings . In oxide\netching, for instance, they withstand extremely\naggressive conditions. And can maintain strength and\nresilience at operating temperatures up to 550 0 F (280\xc2\xb0 C).\nVespel" wafer clamping rings also offer greater toughness,\nwhich prevents fracturing, which can occur with quartz.\n\nLife Enhancement\nIn actual applications, Vespel" parts have lasted up to three\ntimes longer than standard polyimides, because they withstand\nharsh chemicals and plasma environments. They resist wear\nfrom excessive handling and repeated cleanings. And they\nmaintain stability under extremely high temperatures. For\nsemiconductor manufacturers, Vespel" can be the ideal material\nto increase component life in a variety of areas, such as chamber\nliner inserts, gas distribution plate inserts, RF insulator parts,\nedge and focus rings, shield rings, lift pins, and screw caps.\n\nCost Reduction\nTo reduce the cost of ownership, more and more semiconductor manufacturers are turning to Vespel\xc2\xb7. After al/,\nthey\'re discovering that, over time. the performance of Vespel\ncomponents lead to higher production yield and less\ndowntime. That\'s because Vespel\'$\' exceptional cleanliness.\nchemical resistance, durability. and low wear - even in the\nmost extreme condItions - can maximize the life of the\nproduct as well as bottom-line savings.\n\nSEND US YOUR TOUGHEST PROBLEM PART.\nlet us stow \'(lU IxJw Vesper Cirl eIIIiI1d !he 1 of \\W aJlIIXXlI!I1IS Send us\nie\na ~ pall for a ro-obf1ll3OO1l mysis. rnoJeIirJJ. n:l1estJrQ agaIIlSl ot!B\nmaterials.

It would have taken an\nenorrnou amount of time to manually develop a\nequence of the 650 te ts to cover the fault universe of 1100 failure mode for the 60 components. In tead, a new imulationbased test synthe is software package from Intusoft of an Pedro,\nCA, was used to largely automate so that the task could be completed in ju t 240 ho urs.\nThe te t engin eer involved in the proj ect took advantage of the\nsoftware\' ability to automatically generate a fault dictionary fo r\nevery node, and a rough cut of a fault tree that seque nces the\nte ts to detect every failure mode. The ability to tart at thi point\nand simply edit the fault tree to reliably i olate faul ts saved a huge\namount of time.\nThe project began when Instrumenta tio n Engineering Inc. of\nWayne, NJ, was contracted to develop a general-purpo e diagno tics te t tation to service a multitude of analog circuit boards\nused on all the ew York City subway cars. The firm developed a\ndebug tation that utilizes a variety of CPIB and PC in trunlents,\nall of which are tied to a personal computer that run the diagno tic routines. Although the customer i re pon ible for writing\nthe majority of the test sequences, Instrumentation Engineering\ncontracted with Deep Creek Technologie of Phoenix, AZ, to\ndevelop the te t sequence for the propul ion controller circuit\nboard, which is used on the majority of the subway fleet. This\ncard controls propulsion and b raking based upon inputs from\nthe operator interface, CPU, and other ignals, and was selected\nfor development of the initial diagnostic test equences because\nits exceptional complexity made it a good candidate for proof-ofconcept testing.\n\nS\n\n.".\n\ntI"\n\n"\'"\ntI"\n\nFIg_ I .

Te t De igner\' mod el-based fault\ntree computation algoritluns made it a simple matter to identify\nthe most robust circui t measuremen ts, refme the te t limi ts to\ninsure reliability, and as emble the fault cree (Figure 5) . At each\nbranch of the fault tree, the algorithm was invoked to sugge t\nwhich test hould be next in the diagnostic sequence. The availability of reliable failure isolation tests at each node made it an\neasy task to assemble the fault tree. Test De igner kept track of\nthe failure modes that had already been detected and isolated,\nthereby eliminating what is typically a paperwork headache.\nSometimes a situation arose in which a calculated measurement value was directly on tlle pas / faillimit. Such a condition\nwould yield unpredictable results, so the engineer would typically rearrange the test sequence so thal a pdor test would reliably\nisolate that fault and therefore remove it from the fimlt universe.\nWhen such a change was made on an upper node of the fault\ntree, Test Designer recalculated all of the isolations below that\nnode. By first simulating only the go-line te ts while collecting the\nno-fault and faulty circuit behavior characteristics at every node\nand globally assigning coarse test measurement limits, the\ndesired isolation metries were achieved by perfornting each goline test in sequence and, upon failure of such a test, probing the\ncircuit without changing the applied stimuli. Test Designer can\ngenerate the fault coverage statistics and calloQut lists at any point\nin this process, so the test engineer can easily assess whether or\nnot the fau lt coverage and isolation requirements are being met.\n.As the fault cree was developed , Te t Designer displayed all\npertinent detailed test information. Once the fault tree was\nfinalized, Te t De igner generated documentation that defined\nthe lest sequence, again eliminating a tedious manual task.\nThe program can generate ATE pseudo-code in two formats:\nan ATLAS-like ASCII text version, and C code. This p eudocode was upplied to Pat Cupo, senior s}" terns engineer for\nInstrumentation Engineering, who was responsible for writing\nthe oftware program that execute the fault tree. This program prod des the operator with explicit in truction concerning which test to perform next, based upon the re ults of the\nprevious test. Cupo said that thi company was pleasantly surprised to obtain such exbaustive diagno tic routines under\ntight budget and delivery constraints. The project demontrates how the u e of simulation-based synthesis make it posible to complete the entire diagno ties proce s-simulation ,\nte t design, and fault tree development-in one quarter of the\ntime required using manual methods.\nFor more information, please (ontact HalT)\' Dill, pmident of Deep\nCuek Technologies and tlu author of this articl\xc2\xa3, at Deep Creek\nTechnologUs, PO Box 93118, Plwenix, AZ 85070-3118; (602)\n283-0898; fax: (602) 283-0997; E-mail: Test Designer@csi.com;\nwww.deepcreektech.com.\nEleclronic, Tech\n\nBrief~ , June\n\n1999\n\nElectronics Tech Briefs\n1998\nReaders\' Choice Product of the Year\nReaders\' votes for Electronics Tech Briefs\' 1998 Product\nof the Year have been tallied, and the winners are:\n\nold Winner\nand\n\nProduct of the Year:\nSony (Park Ridge, NJ) XC-333 Color CCD Micro-Camera\nModule, incorporating a digital signal processing chip\nfor control\n\nThomas & Betts (Memphis, TN) Metallized Particle\nInterconnections, utilizing a flexible conductive polymer\nmaterial with embedded metallized particles for direct\nsocket connection of microprocessors\nNASA Spinoff, an annual publication ,\nfeatures stories on the successful transfer\nand application of NASA-generated\ntechnology to industry-assisting them\nin the development of new commercially\navailable products and services.\nIf your organization has used NASA\ntechnology In the development of a\ncommercial product and you wish your\nsuccess story to be included in a future\nissue of NASA Spinoff, please\ncontact us at:\n\nzrush@stl.nasa.gov\nor call Zoe Rush at:\n\n(301) 621\'()244\nFor 11 free copy of the latest Spinoff,\n\nvisit www.nasatech.com\n\nNational Instruments (Austi n, TX) IMAO Vision 4.1.1,\na library of machine vision and image processing\nfunctions for LabVIEW\xc2\xb7 and BridgeVIEW\xc2\xb7 incorporating\nMMX technology\nOther finalists include ACCEL Technologies (San Diego,\nCA) Web-Based Product Data Management Software,\nAMP Inc.

Nft_ ARO\n\nA Hybrid Position and Displacement Sensor\nThe ASET sensor measures interfacial stresses in real time.\nSensor Products, East Hanover, ew Jersey\nSen OT Pmducts has recently ftled two\npatents for, and introduced, the ASEP\nsensor fOT measuring interfacial stresses\nin real time. The sensor does not measure force , but rather the amount of surface area under compressive load. The\nprinciple of the ASET, which is a hybrid\nof a position and a displacement sensor,\nlies in treating the entire sensing el.ement as a potentiometer. In the typical\nlinear format design of the ASET sensor,\nnot only can surface area of contact be\ndetermined, but position along the line\ncan be sensed as well.\nThe one caveat of the sensor\'s capacity to detect surface area is that the tactile\nsurface of the object coming in contact\nwith the sensor must be a solid continuous surface. The ASET sensor is available in thicknesses similar to the force\nsensing resistor (FSR) and piezo sensors\ndescribed below. Unlike the resistive ink\nsensors (RIS ) and piezo sensors, the\nASET does not require complicated or\ntime-consuming calibration. The ASET\nsensor is a rugged, durable device that\ncan withstand repeated applications of\ncontact and impact under a wide range\nof environmental conditions.\n\nAs noted above, ASET, conceptually\nsimilar to a linear potentiometer, reveals\nboth interpolated force and po ition of\nan object (or object dimensions), and\ncan sense the position and interpolated\nforce , by virtue of surface area of contact\non a deformable mass, of a single- or\nmultiple-contact actuator. The ASET\nsensoT system does not rely upon a reading of electrical resistance to determine\nthe shunting level (percentage of circuit\nsurface area that is shorted) , but rather\na ratio of the starting resistance to the\nfinal resistance.\nIn addition, a typical RIS sensor has a\nlimited life, as the elastomeric compound\nthat is integral to it begins to fatigue and\ncompress with use. Thus these sensors are\nnot well suited as embedded devices in a\nproduct or system.\nASET bears comparison with other\nsensor technologies on the market.\nMagnetic RIS sensors convert mechanical stresses into electrical charges. RIS\nsensors consist of two sheets, one with a\nsemiconducting polymeT, the other with\na printed conductive ink (dielectric) .\nTypically these two compounds are coated onto Mylar substrates, resulting in a\n\nDIN STANDARD\nExtruded Aluminum Enclosures\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDepths 6" or 8" - any depth, 10 or more\nClear anodize and black wrinkle-finish powder coat standard\nLock-in panel-mounts, stands and dividers\nIntegral extruded card slots on .200 centers\nParts made to print and component assembly available\n\n~\n\nBuckeye ShapeFonn\n555 Marion Road\nShapeFomr Columbus, OH 43207\nwww.buckeyeshapeform.com\n\nPASSIVE COMPO\n\nENTS\n\ntotal package thickness of 4 to 6 mils. A\ntraditional RIS sensor measures force\ndisbursement by measuring actual pressure or force load applied to the sensor\nelement. This method is fraught with\ndifficulties: extreme environmental sensitivity, low repeatability, sensor deformation over time, acute and frequent calibration requirements, and low accuracy.\nFurthermore, the resistance-pressure\nrelationship for RIS sensors is hyperbolic and changes with time.\nCapacitive sensors are relatively similar to RIS sensors but much more accurate and stable. At the same time they\nare much thicker. These sensors cannot\nbe made on flexible substrates, and\ntherefore are difficult to use to monitor\ninterfacial stresses.\nPiezo-film sensor elements are used to\nreveal tactile force distribution as well,\nbut given their abrupt and unpredictable decay time, are primarily relegated to very brief event recorders.\nNeither piezo-film or the RlS are instrument-quality devices suited for precision\nmeasurement.\nPotential applications for the ASET\nare checking roller pressure in real\ntime, and in others where it would be\nembedded into smart structures or\nobjects. It could serve any application\nrequiring a ball or ball joint, where it is\nessential to know the relative position\nand force being applied on the ball.\nAnother use would be in any application involving linear motion of an\nobject that requires knowledge of that\nobject\'S position or amount of force or\nsurface area of the object.\nAnother application area would be\nwhere a solid or semisolid object is moving in three-dimensional space and\nthere exists a need to monitor where\nand when a component of the object is\nstriking or mating with another solid\nsurface. Yet another would be where an\nobject changes dimension as a result of\ncompression or impact and there exists\na need to measure this dimensional\nincrease. Finally, a robotics application\nexists where object grip and surnce area\nof contact and other important considerations need monitoring.\nSome product-specific aspects of the\nASET sensor include the following: it\nhas both dynamic and static load capability; its linearity and hysteresis combined are \xc2\xb1O.2 percent of full scale; it is\nseif-calibrating, relying on ratios of starting-state resistance versus finished resistance; it is environmentally stable, with\nElectronics Tech Briefs,june 1999\n\nan operating range of -40 to +225 of\n(storage: -55 to 225 OF); its accuracy is\n\xc2\xb11.6 percent of full scale; its sen itivity is\n0.01 in.; its repeatability cycle to cycle is\n\xc2\xb10.2 of full scale; its repeatability pan to\npart is the arne; and its creep is 0.01 in.\nper day.\nThe e sensors can be made as thin as\n4 mils.

Some\nworkers, notably in the single-particle\naerial analysis research community, have\naddre ed this problem by combining\ntwo time-of-flight mass spectrometer\nwith a ingle source region, thus producing an instrument that, while effective, is\nlarge and cumbersome.\nThe Paul or radio-frequency (RF) trap\nfirst store ion in an RF field. Typically,\nion are detected by either re onant or\nin tability ejection through an endcap\nelectrode to a detector. The conditions\nfor storage and ejection depend on only\nthe absolute value of the mass-to-charge\nratio, not the sign. In recent years, many\nmanufacturers of IT/MS have added a\nfeature that allows users to select either\npositive or negative ion detection, but\nnot both, becau e the shot-to-shot jitter\nin the signal requires considerable signal\naveraging to give good-quality spectra.\nMuch of thi jitter can be traced to the\nsymmetrical electrode design that is\nalmo t uni\\\'ersally used.

Vespel\nElectronics Tech Briefs,June 1999\n\nsurvives high temperatures, resists heat\ncycling, and holds its shape under pressure. It is also very stable in plasma environments, and demonstrate excellent\nmechanical trength. Finally, becau e\nVespel does not transfer heat, it does not\nattract depositions as readily as other\nmaterials, leading to greater cleanliness in\nthe chamber.\nDr. Ray DeColibus, developer of the\nVespel SCP formulation , confirms that\nVespel\'s metal ion contamination levels\ntend to be very low compared with other\npolymers. Vespel is very stable oxidatively, even at very high temperatures, and\noffers enhanced plasma resistance,\nwhich is particularly critical to emiconductor manufacturers.\nThe largest current consumer ofVespel\nin the semiconductor industry is the etch\nsegment, where it is used for wafer clamping rings, gas distribution plates, insulator\nrings, chamber liners, edge rings, confinement rings, screws and clip , and liftpin components. These Vespel parts contribute to improved die yield through\nincreased etch uniformity and reduced\nedge effect Vespel is also used in PVD,\nCVD, ion implant, and other processes.\nBecause of its unique combination of\nproperties, Vespel i being used to replace\nquartz in a variety of semiconductor applications.

The data in question\npertain to and! or are acquired by payloads that are carried, launched, deployed, repaired, retrieved, or returned\nby the Space Shuttle Program.\nThe SPIF TAC receives and transmits\nNASA communications (NASCOM)\nblocks encapsulated in user datagram\nprotocol (UDP) packets. The SPIF TAC\nreceives payload data in terleaver (PDI) ,\ncalibrated ancillary system (CAS), and\ncommand acceptance pattern (CAP)\ndata from the mission control center\n(MCC) at Johnson Space Center and\nperforms limited processing before passing the data to the advanced carrier cus-\n\ntomer equipment support system (ACCESS) in the Attached Shuttle Payloads\nCenter (ASPC) at Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. In turn, the ACCESS sends commands to the PIF TAC for validation before transmission to the MCC. hould\nerrors arise in the commands, the command re ponse block (CRB) is returned\nto the ACCESS.\nThe SPIF TAC supplants an older system called the "SPIF RS" (RS meaning\nreplacemen t system). It became necessary to replace the SPIF RS with the SPIF\nTAC because the SPIF RS will not be\nable to function after the beginning of\nthe year 2000 and cannot handle the\ntransition to ASCOM Internet Protocol (IP). Because of considerations of\ncost and schedule, it was decided to design a new system (the SPIF TAC) rather\nthan modify the SPIF RS.\nUNIX workstations in the SPIF RS were\nreplaced with relatively inexpensive, low-\n\nmaintenance desktop personal computers in the PIF TAC. The software for\nthe SPIF TAC was developed by use of\nMicrosoft Visual C++ 5.0. Because of this\nuse of commercial off-the-shelf software,\nthe total cost of developmen t was onetenth of the cost of replacing the old\nUNIX computers with new UNIX computers.

It could also be\nused to determine what part of a parallel system is slowing down execution\nof a given application program the\nmost: For example, by artificially setting the CPU speed very high, one\ncould determine how much time is\nused in communication; or by artificiallysetting the communication\nspeed very high, one could determine\nhow much time is consumed in CPU\noperations.\nIt is not necessary to understand\nthe application program or to mathematically model the network in order\nto use Pathcalc. All one needs is the\ntrace files (one such file for each CPU\nof the computer) from a previous run\nof the application program. Pathcalc\nthen generates its estimate on the\nbasis of the trace files and the network parameters provided by the user.\nThe estimate is valid only (1) for a\ncomputer with the same number of\nnodes used to generate the trace files;\n\n(2) provided that message passing is\nrestricted to such simple routines as\nsend, receive, and barrier calls; and\n(3) provided that the execution of\nthe application program can be relied upon to always follow the same\npath through the code, regardless of\nchanges in network response times.\nIn situations in which these restrictions are acceptable, Pathcalc offers\nadvantages of simplicity and speed\nover a number of other programs that\nestimate execution times of application programs; this is because unlike\nthose estimators, Pathcalc uses only\nthe trace information instead of executing the application programs\nthemselves.\nThis work was done &v Paul Springer of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Large multimedia files (for example, files\ncontaining image with text and audio\nannotations) could be accommodated. Advanced file-management feature would be provided: One particularly notable feature of this type i the\nquery by image contents (QBIC),\nwhich can be implemented with commercially available software. For example, if a pecific ection of pipe were\ntested on several occasion and its radiographic image canned into the sy tem on each occa ion, then sub equent retrieval of one of the image\nwould facilitate acce to all like image .

This month, two executives from Compaq Computer Corporation ~ Workstation Division discuss the direction in which the\nfrrofessional workstation 77UJ:Tket is heading. John Thompson, Vue President and General Manager; and David Parsons, Director of\nWomstation Marketingfor North America, were interviewed recently by Chief Editor Linda L Bell at C()mpaq~ Innovate Forum \'99\nin Houston.\n\nThompson:\n\nWe are seeing changes\noveraJl in the market and in the indusrry\nthat are causing us to proactively re-thi.nk\nhow we\'re going to build our customer\nbase. For example, there are really two\ntypes of customers out there. One tends\nto be more low-end; there is a big volume\npush in the low-end part of the market\nspace, which is characterized primarily\nby the Windows NT-based workstation,\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the\npower user - the very high-end CAD or\nEDA user - who typically is looking for\nmore of an Alpha UNIX-based or traditional UNIX-like workstation,\nWhat we\'re doing is aligning the way\nwe\'re going to develop our products, and\nhow we go to market, based on this trend\nthat we\'re seeing. One alignment is to take\nthe Intel-based workstations and proactively align it with the PC products from an\nengineering development perspective.\nRight now, for example, we ship millions\nofPCs each year out of PC manufucturing\nplants that are dedicated to that, as opposed to different plants that do more of\nthe higher-end enterprise or server units.\nThere are a lot of cost-efficiencies that we\nhope to pass on to our end-users - volume\ncapability, logistics capability, and other\n\nJohn TlwmpSOTl, VlCt Presidtnl, General Ma~\nASA Tech Briefs,June ]999\n\ncost-efficiencies - by aligning this more\nclosely with the desktop models.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we\nthink this efficiency can be accomplished\nby aligning our RISC-based offerings\nmore closely from a development perspective with the Alpha server product\nline. Instead of having two different engirleering tean1S, you can still have synergy between those development tearns\nin terms of bringing products to market.\nSo, in terms of the end user or cus-tomer, nothing\'s really changed. There\'s\none workstation division and we work to\nunderstand customer requirements, particularly in the engineering and design\npace. From a unit perspective, the Intelbased workstations tend to be very highvolume products. OveraJl, in the indus-try, there is more growth in the NT-based\nworkstation than in the UNIX workstation. However, there is still clearly a need\nfor that UNIX workstation,\nThere are some companies that are\nchoosing not to address both segments\nof the market. For eXan1ple, if you look\nat Dell, they offer an NT solution, and\nthey really don\'t offer a true UNIX solution. Sun, on the other hand, offers a\nUNIX solution, but doe n\'t really offer\nan NT solution, Hewlett-Packard offers\nboth. Part of our strategy is to leverage\nthe Compaq engine, from a volume perpective, which is PC products, as well as\nintegration of the high-end products to\npush that volume forward.\nWe\'ll continue to target our core markets, which include CAD, and packaging\nand bundling deals with software companie who are our channel partners.\nThe other trend we\'re seeing, from a\ngraphics perspective, is a broader range of\ngraphics. We\'re finding that customers are\nasking for a choice in the graphics area.\nYou might find one graphics company\nwho manufactures a card that fills the\nneeds of 50% of the market, but another\n50% want something else, It\'s increasingly\ndifficult to bet on the right horse. Our approach is going to be to work with OEMs\nwww.nasalech.com\n\nDavid Parsam, Director of WorfIstation Marketing\nfar North America\n\non the graphics products themselves,\nworking in conjunction with our channel\npartners to provide multiple solutions.\nWe also see the market segDlenting into\nthree areas: the traditional RlSC-UNIX\nworkstation; the NT workstation; and the\nNT unbranded workstation, which takes a\nhigh-end desktop product and incorporates workstation-like features such as\nmulti-gigabytes of memory, 300 gigabytes\nof database storage, larger displays up to\n21", and running workstation applications. We intend to capitalize on thaL\n\nParsons: There are three other miniinitiatives that we\'re continuing to drive:\n64-bit computing, and what we\'ll be able\nto provide to clients in that space, particularl in the technical world; UNIX(NT interoperability and integration; and linux.\nSurrounding all of it will be the concept of\nhigh-perfonnance technical computing\nand clustered workstations, that when networked together, provide Cra~e performance at desktop-like price points.\nFor more in/annation, contact Compaq at\n1-800-AT-COMPAQ, or visit their web site at\nWlIIW.
