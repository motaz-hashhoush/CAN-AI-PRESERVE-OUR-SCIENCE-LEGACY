The tray assembly includes a plurality of sealed chambers with a plastic syringe and a plug means for the double tip of the syringe provided therein. Ganging mechanisms operate the syringes and plugs simultaneously in a precise and smooth operation. Preferably, the tray assemblies are mounted on ball bearing slides for smooth operation in inserting and removing the tray assemblies into the carrier assembly. The plugging mechanism also includes a loading control mechanism. A mechanism for leaving a syringe unplugged is also provided.", "title": "Macromolecular crystal growing system", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T12:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, Robert S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "d26656099e38405fa7a023ae8bf4dab9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Herren, Blair J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "0ac343d646f047f891d71c004e0b0cff"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Carter, Daniel C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "bcd662d978fa469c977359e1f48d1237"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yost, Vaughn H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "c84bbc75f18a46ea91d4b957dd48726c"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bugg, Charles E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "0ba0f1a3b3d84f24a1d4639f9bb14dd7"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Delucas, Lawrence J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "8b895c86ba444689b74427169ac04e19"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 19920016155, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Suddath, Fred L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "185991d3e39f41ddba72f6eac18526b2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920016155, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920016155, "id": "983cdb3761b440248eb52ff736b4ec16", "publicationDate": "1991-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920016155.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920016155/downloads/19920016155.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920016155/downloads/19920016155.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920016155/downloads/19920016155.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
