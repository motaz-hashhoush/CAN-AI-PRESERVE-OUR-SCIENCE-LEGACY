Alternatively, the cutting tool can be\nrotated about a tube by a power driving mechanism and\n20\nthe cutting tool can be automatically advanced.\nBACKGROUND O F THE INVENTION\nTube or pipe cutting tools typically include an openthroated tool body attached to a torque arm. On the\ntool body are two pressure rolls and a cutting roll which\nare disposed to either side of a pipe axis for contacting\nopposing sides of a pipe to be cut. The cutter roller or\ncutter wheel is typically attached to an advancing\nmechanism in the torque arm so that as the tool body is\nrotated around the pipe to be cut, the cutter roller can\nbe advanced inwardly toward the central axis of the\npipe and thereby perform a cutting function.\nIn many instances, and this is particularly true in\nspace craft, it is desirable to have various pipes located\nnear to, or attached to, a wall surface. The close spacing\nof pipes prevents use of a conventional pipe cutting\ninstrument where a torque arm must be rotated entirely\nabout the axis of the pipe to be cut. There is a need to\nprovide a pipe cutting instrument which is particularly\ncapable of cutting a pipe in confined spaces and which\ndoes not require complete rotation of the torque arm\nabout the pipe.\nPrior art patents which are indicated as relevant by a\nsearch are as follows:\nU.S. Pat. No. 364,090\nU.S. Pat. No. 514,000\nUS. Pat. No. 543,953\nU.S. Pat. No. 583,892\nU.S. Pat. No. 805,927\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n2\n\nmoved outwardly from the central axis of the tool body\nwhile the tool is being attached to the pipe and moves\ninwardly when the pipe is in a pipe cutting position\nwithin the tool body. Thus, a pipe is clamped by the\nresilient force of the spring biased arm within the set of\nclamping rolls. The tool body is rotatively mounted\nwithin the tool housing and a ratchet mechanism between the tool body and tool housing permits relative\nrotation between the tool body and the tool housing in\nonly one rotation direction. Thus, the tool body can be\nrotated about a pipe with limited angular motion of the\ntool handle.\nIn another aspect of the present invention, the tool\nbody can be rotated about a pipe by a power driven\nmechanism on the tool handle. In still another aspect of\nthe present invention, the cutter roll can be advanced\nby operating the advancing mechanism each time the\ntool body rotates about the pipe. Also, instead of a\ncutter roll, a cutter knife can be used.\nIt is accordingly an object of the present invention to\nprovide a new and improved cutting tool which is selfclamping to a tube or pipe and operable to sever a pipe\nor tube with use of only limited angular motion of the\ntool arm.\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved cutting tool which is automatically driven about the axis of a pipe for severing the\npipe.\nIt is an additional object of the present invention to\nprovide a new and improved cutting tool in which the\ncutter tool is automatically advanced driving the cutting operation.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe details of the invention may best be understood\nin reference to the drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 illustrates a side view of a pipe cutter and\ndetails of the roller cutting mounting;\nFIG. 2 is an end view taken along line 2-2 of FIG.\n1;\nFIG. 3 is a view in cross-section taken along line 3-3\nof FIG. 1.\nFIG. 4 is a view in cross-section taken along line 4 4\nof FIG. 2;\nFIG. 5 is a side view taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 2\n;\nFIG. 6 is a view in cross-section through a ratchet\ncontrol for the roller cutter;\nFIG. 7 is a view similar to FIG. 6 but illustrating the\nratchet in another position.\nFIG.

In this embodiment, the tool\nbody is rotated about the tube by a motor. In FIGS. 8\nand 9, the roller housing portion 24 has a C-shaped plate\nmember 25' attached to one side. The plate member 25'\nhas W O m gear teeth 80 disposed on its outer surface.\nThe teeth 80 mesh with worm threads 81 and 82 disposed On ends of rotatably supported shafts 83 and 84.\nThe other ends of shafts 83 and 84 have gears which\nengage a driving gear 85. The driving gear 85 is on a\nshaft 86 which is driven by a motor 87.\nAs\nthe worm gear teeth 80 extend for an\narc Of approximately 270 degrees except for the open\n'pace between the ends Of the gear teeth 80.

In this embodiment,\nthe threaded member 65 is provided with a spur gear 75\nat its outer end. The spur gear is sized so that the teeth\n76 can project into the plane defined by the outer surface of the plate member 247.\nThe shaft 65 is rotated with the tool body about the\naxis of a tube and the spur gear 75 is rotated therewith.\nOn the handle 11 is a cam pin 78 which is slidably\nmounted in a pin housing 79 for movement between two\nlocked positions. The housing 79 is slightly canted with\nrespect to the handle 11 and the pin 78 is illustrated in an\nactuation position.\nIn the actuation position of the pin 78, each time the\ngear 75 is rotated about a tube, one of the teeth of the\ngear 75 will engage the pin 78 and the gear 75 be rotated\nan incremental distance about its rotational axis. Rotation of the gear 75 rotates the threaded member 65 and\nadvances or retracts the cutting member depending\nupon the setting of the tool. Pin 78 can be retracted to\ndisengage the advancing mechanism from operation.\nAs shown in FIGS. 10 and 12, the cutting member\ncan be a cutter blade 80 which is mounted in a conventional holder.
