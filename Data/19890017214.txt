b'MISSION SCHEDULING\n\n1\nChristine GASPIN\n\nProblems that have combinatorial\ncomplexity are generally said NPcomplete problems (meaning that\nthere are no polynomial algorithm\nfor finding optimal solutions). About\nsolving combinatorial optimization\nproblems, standard operation research methods are effective for\nlittle problems but they often failed\nwhen more complex problems involving many variables and constraints\nare to be solved.\n\nCentre d\'Etudes et de Recherches de Todouse\n\nGroupement dlntelligence Amficielle\n2 avenue Edouard Belin 31 055 Toulouse Cedex\nTel: 61 55 71 11 poste 7442\nTelex: 521 596 F onecert\n\nAbstract\n\nWe investigate through a mission scheduling problem how a neural network can work compared to a\nhyh-iio\' ~ ; v - ~ ~ d. d x i \'01: opei-ahwn\n~ w\nresearch and artificial intelligence\napproach.

Indeed many researchers\nhave shown that neural networks are\nsatisfying constraint systems and\n\nthat we are able to design neural\nnetworks giving very good solutions\nfor operation research problems.\nA number of papers have been yield\nwhich compare different neural\nnetwork techniques for solving opti m iz at io n probI e ms [5,6,7].\nWhenever it is known [3] that\ncomputational power and speed of\ncollective analog networks of neurons in rapidly solving optimization\nproblems has been demonstrated,\nwe ask what are really interests of\na neural approach compared to other\napproaches thrcjugh a specific\nassignment problem.\nWhen OSCAR works with local\nmeasures, we propose to compare,\nfor the same assignment problem,\nsuch a system to an optimization\nmethod based on neural networks\ninvolving a global measure.\nAfter briefly presenting the\nassignmer?t prcblam, we give the\nprinciple of the general assignment\nalgorithm then the neural network\napproach. Then we discuss about\nproperties of both approaches giving\nour topics about\nweakness and\nstrength of each one.\n\n2 The scheduling problem\n\nInterests\nA spacecraft scheduling is a\ndifficult problem because of a large\nnumber of different and interacting\nconstraints, uncertainty and often\nsituation-dependant\noptimization\n\n76\n\ncriteria which make the search\nprocess computationaly complex.\nThe mission scheduling problem\nconsists of finding both a set of\nresources and a temporal position\nfor each elementary lower-level\nactivity. Our interest deals with\nthree points:\n\n-\n\nTemporal relative and absolute\nconstraints\n\n-\n\nActivities which are elementary\naction to be performed on the\nspacecraft or on the ground\nrequiring one resource-group to be\nchosen among various possible\nreso urce-groups.\n\n- Pointwise unsharable resources\ndefined in [9] as resources involving\nboth the assignment and scheduling\nproblems. Such a resource is for\nexample a camera and the camera\nassignment problem has to be the\niollowi ng.\n\nThe camera "resource"\nAn he liosy nc h ro no us spacecraft\npayload consists of cameras with\ntilting capabilities. Therefore, its\nworkload consists of activities Ai\nwhich are processed by taking ri\npictures of a given area from a\npossible set of specified orbits. The\narea is defined on the orbits by its\nbeginning (bi) and ending (ei)\nlatitudes and has a given width.\nMirrors allow to take pictures of the\nlandbelt not only just below the\nsatellite but also above several\nlandbelts beside the central band.\n\nSince weather conditions can alter\nthe quality of a picture, ri p i c t u r e s\nare required lo satisfy an activity\ni.e. get a good picture of all the\nexpected areas.\nLet ri the required number of\nprocessings of activity Ai. The\nworkload is built dynamically and\nthus the assignment of the\nactivities must be updated after\neach request. The sequence of orbits\nis given and cannot be changed in\nany way. Therefore at a given time t,\nthe following orbits 0 1 ...O n are\ndescribed with the activities which\nare assigned to.\n\n3 A "hybrid" system: OSCAR\nOSCAR merges operation research and artificial intelligence\nmethods for solving a large class of\nspatial missions assignment problems (more precisely scheduling\nproblems).\nThe set of problems OSCAR is\nable to solve is the following :\n\ngiven a set of activities, the goal is\nto find both a set o f resources and a\ntemporal position for each elementary activity to process.\nLet us define:\n\n- An a c t i v i t y\ncannot be split and has to be\nassigned on the same resourcegroup. Several resource-groups are\npossible choices for an activity\n\n__\n\nbi\n- - 7\n\neii\na resource is\ndl a-ea cieiinc;?\n\non the orbit by\nits beginning and\nending latitudes\n4 a task Ti needs ri\n\n- A resource-group\nis defined with\n\n. a set of physical resources\n. a time window\n\npmessings\n\n. a duration\n\n. temporal constraints\n\norbits\n\n-\n\nWhy this is a "conflict-solving"\nsystem is that in this activity\nassignment problem we have to\nmake choices that is to find a\nresource (an orbit interval) among\nseveral possible unsharable resources respecting constraints.\n\n77\n\nPhysical resources\nare to be sharable or unsharable,\nconsummable (memory) or not\n(electrical power, camera).\n\n- Temporal\n\nconstraints\nare absolute (beginning and ending\ntimes of an activity are bound to\nstay within a given interval) or\nrelative (between two activities).\n\nTherefore the goal is to find for\neach activity\n\nIt has been proved that the\ngeneral assignment algorithm has\nthe following properties :\n\n. a resource-group\n. an exact temporal position\n\n- It t e r m i n a t e s .\n\nThis approach is i n c r e m e n t a l\nin that an activity enters one after\nanother one from the set of the all\nactivities in a grgwing context. The\ncurrent context is a view of already\nassigned activities b u t it i s\npossible to put this assignment into\nquestion. The philosophy is the\nfo I lowi ng :\nLet A be an activity to be entered in\nthe context\n\n- If the current context has\ne n o u g h room for A, one of the\npossible resource-groups is assigned to A.\n- Otherwise, the mimimal sets\nof activities that prevent A from\nbeing assigned one resource-group\nare detined. Then a minimal set of\nactivities is chosen, ejected from\nthe current context assigning a\ngroup-resource to A, and has to be\nre-planned.\n\n- If one of the ejected activities\ncannot be re-entered into the\ncontext, another minimal set is\nchosen: there is a failure\n\n-\n\nIf all the minimal sets fail, it\nis the total failure\n\n-\n\nIf all the ejected activities\nare to be re-planned, the process\nsucceeds\n\n78\n\n- It is c o m p l e t e : if a solution\nexits, it finds it.\n\n-\n\nTheoretical a n d pratical\nstudies about the average computational complexity of the algorithm\nhave shown that except for few very\nconstrained cases, the average\nnumber of activities that have to be\nre-planned doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on the\nnumber of activities but only\ndepends on the saturation rate of\nthe\ncontext\n(rate\nactivities\n/possible resources).\nSpecific and general heuristics\nare used for choosing:\n\n-\n\nA\n\ngroup-resource\n\nin\n\nthe\n\ncontext\n\n-\n\nA minimal set of activities\n\nOSCAR has been successfully\ntested\non\ncamera\nresource\nassignment problem concerning an\nEarth-Obsevation Satellite.\n\n4\n\nThe neural network\napproach\n\nWe are interested here in solving\na complex optimization problem in\nparallel without learning process.\nAbout solving constraint satisfaction problems [ l o ] gives three\nneural networks models :\n\n-\n\nThe Hopfield network [l].\n\n-\n\nThe Boltzmann machine [4].\n\nwhere\nw i j is the strength of connections between units U i and Uj,\n\n- The Tank and Hopfield network\n[31.\n\nis the state of unit i,\n\nSi\n\nOur goal is not here to compare\nthe three models applied to a\nspecific problem (we find comparisons of models through the\ntravelling salesman and the graph\nbisection problems in [5,7])but we\nwant \'to show how they efficiently\ncan help to solve an assignment\n.problem, what are their weakness\nand strength compared with the\n, previous approach.\nWe use both Hopfield networks\nand Boltzmann machines during our\nsimulations.\nThese models consist of a large\nnumber of computing elements\ncalled units that are connected to\neach other by bidirectional links and\nthis massive interconnection gives\ntnem an important computationai\npower.\n\nli is the threshold of unit i.\nIf the units change their\nstates one at a time (0 ---> 1),\ngiven a configuration C, then firstly\na neighbouring configuration C\' is\ngenerated, changing unit U i state\nand secondly it is evaluated.\nBecause the connections are\nsymetric, the difference between\nthe energy of configuration C and C\'\ncan be determined locally by the\nunit U i a n d\n\nthus allowing a parallel execution.\nIn an Hopfield model t h e rule\ndecisizn Is :\nSi\n\nWith each unit u i a binary\nvalue is associated, denoting its\nstate "0" or "1," (on or off).\nTherefore, at a given time the\nnetwork can be represented by a\nstate vector. Weights on links are\nsymetric, (having the same strength\nin both directions). A solution is\ngiven by a configuration C of the\nnetwork that is the state vector.\nAn "objective" function of a global\nconfiguration is defined by analogy\nwith statistical mechanics energy\n\n=\n\nin the Boltzmann machine, the\nunits are in one of the two states\ndetermined as a probabilistic\nfunction of the states of its\nneighboring units (these which are\nconnected to) and the weights on its\nlinks to them. The acceptance\nprobability in changing a unit state\nis\np(Si = 1) = 1 / (1 + exp(-AEi/T))\n\nwhere\n\n79\n\n0 if AEi < Ii\n1 otherwise\n\nT is the computational temperature used in simulations as a\ncontrol parameter associated with a\nsimulated annealing process which\nis a statistical generalization of\nhill-climbig optimization methods.\nIt allows to make uphill moves\ninstead of settling in local minimum.\nT=O is the limit-case used in the\nHopfield model.\nThe dynamics of evolution of\nthese systems states follow a\nsimple rule (above) and is asynchronous (a unit is randomly chosen and\ntries to change its state given its\ninputs) .\n\nThe solution to the assignment\nproblem consists of an optimal\nassignment with the respect to the\ninteracting constraints.\n\nTo map this problem onto the\ncomputational network, we require a\nrepresentation that needs to b e\ndecoded. We have chosen a representation scheme in which the final\nassignment\' is specified by a configuration of the network.\nFor example, if an activity Ai\nrequires ri = 3 processings and if a\npossible set of resources for Ai is\nQI = (Ol(1 10) 02(3 13) 03(0 9) Oll(10 18))\n\na possible solution is given by\n\nThe updating rule of a unit state\n\nis an energy optimizing rule\n(minimizing / maximizing ).\nModifications of units states continue until a stable state is reached,\nthat is, an energy optimum is\nreached.\n\n~\nrl\n\n~\nR\n\n01\n\n0\n\nr3 r l r2 r3 r l r2 r3 r l\n\n02\n\n03\n\nr2 r3\n\n011\n\n-\n\nThe processing r l of Ai is on the\norbit Ol(1 10)\n\nMapping a satisfaction\nconstraints problem\n\n-\n\nFor mapping a satisfaction\nconstraint problem we have to:\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFind a representation of\nthe problem as to be solved by a\nneural network.\nIndeed, the I itte rat ure often invo Ive\nschemes which are operation research ones (matrix, graphs) and we\nhave to investigate if it is relevant\nto relate operation research representation problems to neural techniques.\n\n80\n\nThe processing r2 of Ai is on the\norbit 02(3 13)\nThe processing r3 of Ai is on the\norbit O l l ( 1 0 18)\n\n-\n\nDefine units. Therefore a\nunit is the elementary information\nto process in this optimization\nproblem and it means :\na possible choice\nfor assigning\nthe activity Ai to the resource Oj\nrespecting its temporal constraints.\n\nThis representation scheme is\nnatural since any activity can be\nassigned to any one in its related\npossible set of resources.\nThe number of units required for\na problem where p activities are\ninvolved is therefore\n\nN = Zp np units\n\n~30.00000.00\nr3 r l r2 r3 r l r2 r3 r l\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n02\n\nr2 r3\n\n03\n\n011\n\naif00.00\nr l r2 r l r2 r l r2\n\n/!!\n\nwhere\nthat is we cannot find r l on orbit 0 1\nfor activity Ai and r2 on orbit 0 1 for\nactivity Ai\'.\n\n"P\n\n-\n\nI\n\n(the number of processings of\nactivity p)\n\n- different processings of the\nsame activity cannot share the same\npart of an orbit.

Therefore,\nsolving such a complex optimization\nproblem needs a large number of\nunits and a highly connected\nnetwork. But because of the 1011\nneurons and 106 connections from\neach one in the nervous system and\nvery encouraging results which\nappear in the domain,\'it is relevant\nto investigate how the computational power of these networks can\nhelp to solve optimization problems.\n\nSpatial complexity\nTemporal complexity\n\nThe neural network simulations\nalways converged giving satisfying\nsolutions from an engineering point\nof view for little examples with\n256 units (25 activities and 21\nresources) or less.\nIf the complexity has been\ntheoretically and pratically studied\n83\n\n-\n\nLocality of taking\ndecisions\n\nThe assignment algorithm decides with locality. Indeed, when a\nnew task enters, only its possibility\nof assignment is investigated.\nThe new task is p~ is not able to be\nplanned. No global criteria is taken\ninto account. An already planned\ntask is ejected only if it is sure to\nget another assignment.\n\nA neural net approach also\ndecides locally about an assignment.\nIndeed the model is based on\ncomputational locality of decision\nin the units. Morever, it takes\nimmediatly\ninto\naccount\nthe\nconstraints on other units that is\nthe constraints of the problem.\nTherefore, there is a "microscopic"\ndecision\nsystem\n(cooperation\n/competition) in every unit because\nof the neighbourood.(defined by the\nconnections.)\n\n-\n\nExample\n\nIn this example the R.O. and I.A.\napproach can only cope with two\nactivities:\n\nGlobal I incremental\n\ndecisions\nThe set of constraints mapped on\nthe connections to a unit makes the\nunit to take locally a global decision\nthat is it computes a global criteria\nto optimize.\nWe give for example in [8] a\ncriteria to maximize "the probabiiity of satisfying all the activities\'.\nTherefore an already planned task is\nejected i f the new activity optimizes the "objective" function\nsatisfying the constraints given by\nthe neighbours (the units which it is\ndirectly connected to).\nIn comparison, the research\noperation and artificial intelligence\napproach is an incremental decision\nprocess in which no global criteria\nis computed.\nIf the objective is to use all the\nressources realizing the best\nassignment we find the following\nresults for each approach:\n\n84\n\n-T1 enters and is satisfied\nwith T1 on orbits 0 1 and 0 2\nor\nT1 on orbits 01 and 0 3\n\nor\nT1 on orbits 0 2 and 03.\n-T2 enters and is satisfied\nwith 1 2 on orbits 0 3 and 04,\nand T1 on orbits 01 and 02.\n-T3 cannot be satisfied\nwithout definitively ejecting\nT1 or T2\n-T4 cannot be satisfied\nwithout ejecting T2\nIn that case, our network satisfied\nT1, T3 and T4, i.e. three tasks:\n-11 on orbits 0 1 and 0 2\nor\nTlon orbits 0 1 and 0 3\nor\nT1 on orbits 0 2 and 0 3\n\n-T3 on orbits 01 and 0 6\nand T1 on orbits 0 2 and 0 3\nor\nT3 on orbits 0 3 and 0 6\nand T1 on orbits 0 1 and 02.\n\n-T4 on orbits 0 4 and 0 5\nand T3 on orbits 01 and 0 6\nand T1 on orbits 0 2 and 0 3\nor\nT4 on orbits 0 4 and 0 5\nand T3 on orbits 0 3 and 0 6\nand T1 on orbits 0 2 and 03.\n\n-\n\nnetwork and provide encouraging\nresults in comparison with an\noperation research and intelligence\nartificial approach.\nNevertheless for neural networks which deal with such complex\ncombinatorial optimization problems, the difficult task consists of\nfinding weights of the connections.\nIndeed, because the solutions to\nthese problems are not known as in\nother problems involving learning\nalgorithms [6], they must be established by the designer.\nOur interest is now to design a\nmapping\nmethod\nfor\nsolving\nconstraint satisfaction problems\n(more precisely scheduling problems) through applications exploration and theoretical results.\nI\n\nProgramming complexity\n\nIn the neural network formulation of an optimization problem, the\nconstraints and the criteria to\noptimize are expressed inside the\nobjective function. Thus by optimizing the objective function we\noptimize the satisfaction of the\nconstraints. Morever, this approach\nprovides an efficient and very\nsimple technique for mapping the\nconstraints on the links between\nunits.\n\n7 References\nHOPFIELD, J.J.,\nNeural Networks and Physical\nSystems w.?h Emergent\nCollective Comp utational\nAbilities, Proc.
