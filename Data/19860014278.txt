Hu\n\nLast May, an American space delegation led by M. A.\n\n/88\n\nSilveira, chief engineer at NASA, visited China and toured\nspace and aviation scientific research and production organizations in Beijing, Xian and Shanghai. They also published\narticles on what they saw and heard thus reflecting part of the\npresent situation of developments in China\'s space and aviation\nindustries.\nSpace Plans\nChina has successfully launched 16 satellites since the 1970\'s\nThe carrier rockets employed were the type-1, type-2 and type-3\n"Chang Zheng" (i.e. CZ-1, CZ-2 and CZ-3). The CZ-2 can send a\nmore than two ton payload into an earth synchronous orbit. The\nCZ-2 and CZ-3 use the same first and second stage liquid\nrockets; the CZ-3 uses the hydrogen-oxygen engine for the third\nstage. They have decided to develop a large-scale transport\nrocket at the latter part of the 1990\'s similar to the Saturn 1\nof the United States to launch China\'s large-scale satellites.\nAt present, China is researching the solid rocket bound-type\nbooster to raise the capabilities of the CA-2 and CZ-3 carrier\nrockets. In the future, the CZ-2/3 series carrier rockets will\nuse the new third stage solid rocket.\nChina\'s present policy is the comprehensive development of\nits national economy and therefore they have stressed improving\nproduction of energy resources and conditions of transportation.\nChina thus hopes to launch satellites once or twice a year. It\nhas also been announced that China will make the cost of the\n"Chang Zheng" series carrier rocket lower than the Ariane of\nEurope, American spacecraft and other single use carrier rockets\nand throw them into the international satellite launch market.\n\nA certain\nagreement\nStates to\nlaunching\nthe costs\n\njoint company of Beijing, China has already reached an\nwith the Space Vector Company of California, United\nuse the CZ-1 and CZ-3 to launch satellites. The\ncosts of the CZ-1 are only 4.1 million American dollars;\nfor the CZ-3 have not been negotiated.\n\nThe reliability of China\'s carrier rockets is a question of\ngreat concern to users. According to statistics since 1975,\nCZ-2 and CZ-3 carrier rockets successfully launched payloads into\norbit 12 times and there have been two or three failures. The\nreasons for the failures were all due to breakdowns which occurred in the guidance systems. On January 29, 1984, the CZ-3 made\nits first flight but-because the third stage rocket was unable\nto successfully ignite twice there was partial failure. This\ncaused the payload to be unable to enter the earth synchronous\ntransfer orbit from the low orbit. A satellite launched during\nthe middle of 1979 was a failure and so the payload dropped on\nto the Australian mainland or into the sea.\nAs regards the types of satellites launched, they have\ndesigned earth synchronous communication satellites, meteorological satellites as well as scientific satellites and direct\ntransmitting satellites etc.\nOn April 8, 1984, China successfully launched its first communication satellite STW-1 into .earth synchronous orbit.\nAlthough its design life is only one month, yet to date, it is\nstill operating normally. This unexpected long life has caused\nChinese to lengthen their real time television and telephone\ncommunication testing time. China uses two independent ground\nstations and communicates by means of this type of satellite\nfour times a day to check the functions of each system. It is\nreported that when the satellite turned from the sun\'s shadow\nperiod to its period of shining, the attitude control system\nof the satellite broke down. From tracking measurement data it\n\nwas known that this type of communication satellite was possibly in a certain kind of drift orbit and was not fixed on a\ntruly synchronous orbit with exact longitude.\nThe new communication satellite was fixed to be launched at\nthe end of 1985 or the beginning of 1986. If the launch of\nthis satellite is successful, it will be a back-up satellite\nof the STW-1. It also uses the CZ-3 for launching and the oxygen/\nhydrogen engine for the third stage. However, its difference\nwith the STW-1 is that it is equipped with a 1.22 meter long and\n0.76 meter wide graphite epoxy resin point beam antenna\n/89\nwhich allows the transmitted signals to only cover Chinese\nterritory.\nThe third communications satellite will be launched in 1987.\nThis satellite will be designed and made by China and aside from\nbeing equipped with a point beam antenna, they will greatly\nraise the entire satellite\'s microwave communications capacity\nwherein it will use more sophisticated electronics technology\nthan that of the first satellite and the back-up satellite.\nThe Chinese direct transmission satellite designed by RCA of\nthe United States and MBB of West Germany is set to be launched\nin 1987 with spacecraft of the United States or the Ariane of\nEurope [Note: according to the latest information, this has\nalready been cancelled].\nThe Shanghai Satellite Engineering Research Institute will\nlaunch a 675 kilogram polar orbit meteorological sattelite in\n1987. This 1.4 meter square satellite has two large solar\nenergy cell arrays on the sides and each array is composed of\nthree solar energy cell plates. The main instrument of this\nsatellite is two radiometers and each has three communicating\nchannels which can provide visible light and infrared pictures.\nThe maximum numerical resolving power is 0.97 kilometers and\n\n3\n\nthe operating life is one year.\nHowever, the tape recorder and\ngyroscope have not yet reached predicted performance requirements and they hope to obtain technical assistance from the\nUnited States. The Chinese believe that they will continue to\ncarry out meteorological satellite development plans so as to\nestablish a continuously operating polar orbit meteorological\nsatellite system and an earth synchronous orbit meteorological\nsatellite system.\nThe seventh low orbiting camera satellite was successfully\nlaunched during the second half of last year. The film of this\ntype of satellite was retrieved from a 1.5x1.8 meter re-entry\nrecovery capsule. The film was able to be used for military\nreconnaissance and earth resources surveying. An American delegation saw multi-spectrum pictures retrieved from a 1984 launch\nand the resolving power of the small plots of farmland in the\npictures was excellent. They could be used to predict the\nharvest of China\'s agriculture industry.\nIn order to fill in the deficiencies in the retrieval of\nmulti-spectrum film in camera satellites, China is developing\nan image transmitting remote sensing satellite. Plans are to\nlaunch it in 1988-1990. Its performance will be very similar to\nthat of France\'s SPOT remote sensing geodesic satellite. The\nXian Radio Technology Research Institute is now developing the\ncharge coupled device (CCD) sweep scanner and the quality of\nthe pictures is very good. The Chinese have also used it to\ndevelop the remote controlled remote sensing spacecraft to make\na battlefield monitoring system. The multi-spectrum pictures\ntaken by the low orbiting remote sensing satellite are sent\nback to earth by radio signals. The diameter of the ground satellite picture receiving antenna is 3 meters.\nCh_i.na is now setting up new space industry installations. An\nAmerican delegation saw the construction of a new solid engine\n\nresearch institute in progress in Xian for the development of\nsolid engines for intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine launched ballistic missiles. A five storied building is\nbeing constructed in Beijing where they will develop a space\noptics system; they are also building a three storied building\nto be used for carrying out standard corrections in space technology; the foundation has already been laid for a satellite\nenvironmental experimental research center. The delegation\nobserved a large anechoic chamber and water channel in Xian.\nThe water channel provides simulation tests for aircraft and submarines and it is as large as similar American installations.\nMany organizations are also outfitted with new minicomputers.\nSome were imported from the United States and Europe.\nHowever, the vast majority of space research and test facilities seen by delegations were out of date and backward. There\nwas inadequate lighting in the buildings and the level of\nclarity was not high. China is lacking experience in the management and organizationofa large-scale space program. China\nemploys the strictly separated management method which has\nobstructed technical exchange between several space centers. The\nChinese say that China has already made progress by cooperating\nwith Western Europe and they have also reached cooperation\nagreements with Japan. China hopes to attain even greater developments through cooperation with the United States. At present,\nChina is investigating the direct transmission satellite report\nplan of the MBB Company of West Germany and the RCA Company of\nthe United States. China\'s position is important to the United\nStates and Europe.\nAviation Plans\nIn the area of the aviation industry, an American delegation\nobserved an aircraft manufacturing plant attached to the Shanghai\nAviation Industry Company and an aircraft manufacturing plant of\n\nthe Xian Aircraft Company.\nThe delegates climbed aboard the Y-10 transport aircraft\ndesigned by the Shanghai Aircraft Plant while they were at the\nplant. The aim for this aircraft is research and development\nand there are no plans to put it into production. They have\ngained experience from designing, manufacturing and test flying\nit so as to make it convenient to assemble the MD-82 transport\naircraft of the McDonald Douglas Company at this plant. The\nexternal appearance of the Y-10 is similar to that of the\nBoeing 707 but the designs of the wings, leading edge flaps\n/90\nand empennage are noticeably different. The Y-10 uses the\nJT3D-7 turbofan engine of the Pratt and Whitney Company of the\nUnited States. These engines were provided when China purchased\n10 Boeing 707. China strongly maintains that they did not copy\nthe Boeing 707 in their design and manufacture of the Y-10.\nIts design features are:\n(1) In the area of wing design, they eliminated the trailing edge camber of the Boeing 707\'s wing surface so as to reduce\nthe pitching moment; they also used a relatively simple double\nchannel folding wing layout;\n(2) In the area of flap design, they used aluminum casted\nflaps which have outside fillet conical shapes on the entire\nwing;\n(3) In the area of empennage design, the Y-10 has a larger\nvertical empennage than that of the Boeing 707 but the swept\nback empennage is smaller. This is done to prevent rolling/\nyawing, coupling or Dutch rolling;\n(4) In the area of landing gear, the Y-10 uses the engine\nwhereas the Boeing 707 uses an hydraulic system to lift the\nlanding gear;\n(5) The cockpit seats five crew members, that is, one flight\nengineer sits between two pilots and there is one radio operator and one navigator on the left and right. The Boeing 707\n\nonly seats three persons.\n(6) The instrument panel arrangement is the same as standard four engine jet transport aircraft but the fuel level gauge\nand temperature gauge are placed directly in front of and\nabove the pilot.\nThe Y-10 aircraft has 124 seats wherein there are two rows\nin the first class cabin and three rows in the second class cabin.\nThe overhead baggage compartments are the same as in most\nAmerican transport aircraft.\nThe Y-10 carried out its first test flight in 1980 and it has\nnow completed its flight test plan. It has accumulated..200\nhours of flight time in 120 flights.\nThe Shanghai Aircraft Plant has 6,000 workers and among these\nover 800 are engineers and technicians.\nThe Shanghai Aviation Industry Company and McDonald Douglas\nCompany have just held discussions about a three year turbofan\ntechnical reserve agreement and yet one part will not necessarily be an agreement on the MD-82 aircraft. China is exploring\na type of technically advanced medium and close range transport\naircraft. Its propulsion system has still not been determined\nand they must investigate the marketplace. If they want to\nimplement well the aircraft plans for the MD-82, the Shanghai\nAviation Industry Company requires several hundred new engineers and workers. China has been enacting an open foreign\npolicy and this company is welcoming more visits by foreign\ndelegations. This company hopes to transform itself into a\nhighly technical aviation organization with excellent products\nand facilities.\nThe Xian Aircraft Plant which is about 64 kilometers north\nof Xian has already built a Chinese model of the Soviet Tu-16\nbomber. They have also produced a twin engine, upper single\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n"\n\n7\n\nwing, turbojet engine Chinese "Yun-7" transport aircraft which\nresembles the Soviet An-24 . This plant is also researching\nnew twin engine supersonic bombers and other military aircraft\n(two person fighters or advanced trainers).\nThe American delegation observed a hangar with two Chinese\nTu-16 type bombers. One of them had two new circular engine\nhanging compartments. This is a modification of the Tu-16\naircraft called the Tu-16/"Hong-6". When the Chinese use the\nMikulin RD-3M (turbojet-8) engine, they do so based on the\nstandard design of the Tu-16: there is a flat side surface and\nthe air inlet of the engine and the fuselage are stuck together\non this side surface. In the new design, the engine is moved\ntowards the outside under the wing and the hanging compartments are circular so as to reduce the problem of the boundary\nlayer around the air inlet.\nAfter 1,000 hours of flight, the Tu-16 bomber had its first\noverhaul; after 3,000 hours of flight, it had its second\n/91\nmajor overhaul. The other Tu-16 bomber in the hangar was produced in 1969. It has already been flown 3,000 hours by the\nAir Force and is now going through major overhaul. By opening\nthe bomb hatch, one can see the bomb racks for the conventional\nbombs and atomic bombs.\nSix Tu-16 bombers were lined up and being repaired in the\nmaintenance area of the airfield and the bombers appeared\nespecially clean. This aircraft is equipped with six 23mm machine guns and one 30mm machine gun. All of the modified Tu-16\nare equipped with air-to-air missiles. Further, they also added\na radar antenna radome on the nose and suspended two C-60 antisubmarine missiles under the wings.\nThe "Yun-7" transport aircraft produced by this plant has\n48 seats. The cockpit can seat five persons. The KWX-58 color\n\n8\n\ndisplay radar made by the King Company of the United States\nis a component part of the aviation electronics equipment of\nthe "Yun-7." The Chinese are thinking of using the engine of\nthe Pratt and Whitney Company of Canada or the Rolls Royce\nengine to replace the engine of the "Yun-7." They are also\nthinking of seeking American help and installing new aviation\nelectronics equipment.\nIn the past, the Xian Aircraft Plant made certain parts of\nthe wing\'s trailing edge for the Boeing 747. Since 1980, the\nBoeing Company signed a contract with this plant to make\nelectronic cabin doors for the Boeing 737. Further, they will\nalso deliver 100 vertical empennages for the Boeing 737. Last\nJune, China delivered seven electronic cabin doors and some are\nnow being transported. China will also deliver 70 doors and\nfor the most part productivity is five doors per month.\nThis\nis becaus.e this plant simultaneously wants to make much larger\nempennage modules. The Boeing Company considers that the quality is very high.\nThe Xian Aircraft Plant has 15,000 personnel and among these\n3,000 are engineers and technicians. Several hundred personnel\nare researching design plans for a supersonic bomber. There is\na 3,300 meter long aircraft runway near the plant.\nThis plant has 2,000 lathes and most of the larger lathes\nare Soviet made. There are two 90 meter wide and 180 meter long\nlarge factory buildings. They are equipped with lathes and yet\nthe utilization rate of the equipment is only 30%. At present,\nthey are producing the "Yun-7" transport aircraft and Tu-16\nmodified bomber. Further, there are also some aircraft which\nare being repaired.\nThis plant has jst set up a computer room and it is equipped\nwith the Siemens 7356 computer of West Germany. This computer\ncan carry out many types of design computations for the factory.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR OjUALfTY\nFurther, when joined with the Siemens 7760 computer in Xian,\nit can be used to support many industrial users in this region.\nThey will soon import a new IBM computer from the United States\nto carry out computer assisted design of aircraft structure.\nThe other computer room in this plant has ten IBM PC computers\nwhich use Chinese characters to display data.\nA relatively advanced piece of equipment in this plant is\nthe contour tracker manufactured by the Digital Electronics\nAutomation Company of Italy. Its precision is 6 mil.\nThis plant also has a very large engineering drafting room.\nEach of the large engineering drafting tables holds 20 sheets\nin a total of 20 rows. All of these sheets are manually drafted,\nOver the last two years, they have begun to use automatic\ndrafting instruments.\n\nFig. 1\n10\n\nA synchronous communication satellite developed and\nmanufactured by China.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nFig. 2\n\nOn January 29, 1984, China used the "Chang Zheng" No. 3\ncarrier rocket to launch an experimental communication\nsatellite.\n\nFig. 3\n\nThe large laser movie transit used by China to track and\nmeasure experimental communication satellites.\n11\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR 0"ALfTY\n\nFigs. 4 , 5 , 6\n\n12\n\nThree views of China\'s Monitoring Control Center\n\nFig. 7\n\nThe "Hong-6" bomber has two C-601 air-to-submarine\nmissiles suspended under its two wings.
