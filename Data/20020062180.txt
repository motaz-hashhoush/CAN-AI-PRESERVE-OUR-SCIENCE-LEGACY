It\xe2\x80\x99s your\xe2\x80\xa6Internet network?!\nAn innovative service provider of metro gigabit IP\nconnectivity, has developed a point-to-multipoint\nsolution to solve the Internet last-mile bottleneck barrier.\nTerabeam, of Seattle, Washington, has developed a Fiberless\nOptical\xe2\x84\xa2 Network that transmits broadband data from\noffice buildings to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wide-area networks (WANs),\nwithout digging up the streets.\nA key component of Terabeam\xe2\x80\x99s Fiberless Network is Large\nAperture Holographic Optic technology, developed by Ralcon\nDevelopment Lab, of Paradise, Utah. Ralcon developed the\nHolographic Optical Element (HOE) technology with\nassistance from a NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) contract. Terabeam\nfurther developed the HOE technology and incorporated it\ninto its Fiberless Optical Network\xe2\x80\x94sending an immeasurable\namount of information soaring overhead.\nData on the Internet is sent at rapid speeds over thousands\nof miles on long-haul networks before reaching its final\ndestination. When the data reaches its urban termination\npoint, it must pass through a final mile to reach the customer\n\nTerabeam\xe2\x80\x99s Fiberless Optical\xe2\x84\xa2 Network transmits\nbroadband data from office buildings to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s\nwide-area networks (WANs) through the air.\n\n100\n\nCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\nsite. The track that carries the data over this last leg of its\njourney is usually composed of copper and is low in bandwidth, resulting in an information back-up, or last-mile\nbottleneck. Efforts to solve this problem use existing fiberoptic cable leads. However, installing new or additional fiberoptic leads would require costly construction permits, street\ntrenching and traffic disruption.\nTo combat this problem, Terabeam developed its Fiberless\nOptical Network using a proprietary HOE to transmit data.\nThe unit is mounted near an office window and has the\nability to beam safe, low-power, invisible data through the air\nat gigabits-per-second speeds to anywhere in the service area.\nGigabits-per-second speeds are thousands of times faster than\nthe speeds of current broadband transmissions. This allows\nbusinesses to connect to local-area networks (LANs) as well as\nWANs, in a quick and affordable manner. The Fiberless\nOptical Network is cost effective because it does not\nrequire a licensed spectrum, or any of the other costly and\ntime consuming procedures associated with other network\nset-ups, such as laying fiber-optic cable and prolonged\ndeployment time.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nIt is projected that the broadband Internet access market\nwill be $33 billion by 2003. Realizing the potential of\nTerabeam\xe2\x80\x99s technology, Lucent Technologies joined forces\nwith Terabeam to develop and deploy this revolutionary\nsystem. \xe2\x80\x9cPeriodically, technology is developed that has the\npower to significantly change the landscape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rich\nMcGinn, chairman and CEO, Lucent Technologies. He\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cTerabeam\xe2\x80\x99s Fiberless Optical Network system is such\na disruptive technology. We are pleased to be working with\nTerabeam to help them bring their gigabit-speed Internet\naccess to customers.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne investment company chose Terabeam\xe2\x80\x99s connectivity\nnetwork because they needed to move large data files between\ntheir West Coast locations.

In an effort to maintain\nthe highest quality service, the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel,\nSeattle, Washington, chose to provide guests with this cutting\nedge network to allow them to connect to their offices or the\nInternet at speeds 2,000 times faster than the typical hotel\ndial-up connections. Terabeam has provided its Fiberless\nOptical Network service to a variety of businesses and plans\nto continue its efforts to revolutionize the broadband service\nindustry. \xe2\x9d\x96\nFiberless Optical\xe2\x84\xa2 Network is a trademark of Terabeam.\n\nNASA SPINOFF \xe2\x9e\xa4 2001\n\nCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\n101\n\n'
