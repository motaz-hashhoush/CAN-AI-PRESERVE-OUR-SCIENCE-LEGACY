b'18. QUIET ENGINE PROGRAM\nPRELIMINARY ENGINE DESIGN AND AIRCRAFT INTEGRATION\nBy Joseph F. McBride\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nSUMMARY\nDesign studies sponsored by National Aeronautics and Space Administration have\nresulted in identification of engine cycle characteristics, engine mechanical configurations, and component aerodynamic design parameters which allow turbofan airplane power\nplants to operate with lower noise output. Preliminary designs of such engines have been\nmade to define the weight and size compromises resulting from design considerations for\nengine quieting. Engine noise output is predicted to be significantly lower than that produced by currently operating engines. Integration of the quiet engine with a typical subsonic jet transport has been investigated. Study results indicate that useful turbofan\nengines designed for low noise production are compatible with subsonic jet transport\nsystems.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe acoustic suppression technology reviewed earlier holds great promise of\nallowing reduction of the turbomachinery noise produced by airplane engines. In addition,\nthe NASA is very interested in quieting engines by minimizing production of noises at\ntheir sources.\nDesign considerations for the quieting of airplane jet engines have been the subject\nof a NASA study program over the past 2 years. This Quiet Engine Definition Program\nhas been directed toward selection of thermodynamic cycle characteristics and mechanical\ndesign features which will produce quiet engines to power subsonic commercial jet transports. An engine would be considered quiet if it produced take-off and landing-approach\nnoise levels on the ground significantly lower, by 4 5 PNdB, than those of the JT3D and\nJT8D engines. I such noise reductions can be gained through engine design features\nf\nalone, further reductions through the application of suppressors would produce a truly\nquiet airplane power plant.\nThe quiet engine program at the NASA Lewis Research Center began in late 1966\nwith a study of the effects of high bypass turbofan cycle characteristics on engine jet noise\nlevels, fuel economy, engine size, and airplane payload and range. The quieter engine\n\n263\n\nwas known to be most needed for the long-range four-engine airplanes; therefore, compatibility with the Boeing 707 and McDonnell Douglas DC-8 was made an engine design\nguideline.\nMany years of NACA and industry experience in jet-exhaust noise-suppression work\nhave indicated that little reduction in jet noise through the application of mechanical\ndevices such as lobe and tube suppressor nozzles can be expected. Therefore, emphasis\nwas placed on achieving the lowest practicable level of jet noise through proper selection\nof turbofan-engine cycle parameters. The turbofan engine has the well-known feature of\nallowing the slowing of average exhaust velocity and, as a result, lowered jet noise production and improved propulsive efficiency.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the calculations in determination of turbofan jet noise and physical\nsize as functions of the various cycle characteristics can be plotted on a single map such\nas that in figure 1. This figure shows the noise produced by the fan and core exhaust\nstreams at take-off power over a range of bypass ratio and fan pressure ratio for a\nselected combination of turbine temperature ratings and for a fixed overall cycle pressure\nratio. The trends in jet noise output and physical size of the engine shown in this figure\na r e indicative of those found at all other chosen temperature and cycle pressure ratio\nvalues.\nWhen jet-exhaust noise is reduced through proper application of a high bypass ratio\ncycle, the fan of the turbofan engine becomes the dominant noise source. Core engine\ncompressor noise and turbine noise must be contended with, but until fan noise is greatly\nreduced, they do not become dominant. The jet noise levels possible at bypass ratios\ngreater than 4.0 in figure 1 a r e very low compared with the total noise developed by current engines. If the fan noise can be reduced through design and acoustic suppression to\nthose jet noise levels, a truly quiet power plant will be achieved.\nThe cycle studies performed at NASA Lewis Research Center provided a field of\ninteresting cycle points around bypass ratio 5.0. More detailed engine configuration\nstudies in cooperation with the turbine engine industry were then initiated. Pratt &\nWhitney Division of United Aircraft Corporation was contracted (Contract no. NASS-10497)\nunder the Quiet Engine Definition Program in July of 1967 and began a parametric study of\nengine performance, size, weight, and jet and fan noise output for turbofan engines covering the following range of cycle characteristics:\n\n264\n\nCruise thrust, lb . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n4900\nTake-off thrust, lb . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n20 000 to 25 000\nBypass ratio\n3 to 8\nFan pressure ratio . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.3 to 1.7\n15 to 30\nCompressor pressure ratio\nTurbine inlet temperature, cruise, O F\n1600 to 2100\n1600 to 2300\nTurbine inlet temperature, take-off, O F .\n\n.....................................\n............................\n....................\n...................\n\nThe results of this study provided no clearly best choice for a quiet engine cycle, but\nindicated that potentially attractive engines were possible at any bypass ratio between 3.0\nand 8.0.\nSelected sets of engine parameters were given to Pratt & Whitney and to a second\ndefinition program contractor (Contract no. NAS3- 10496), the Allison Division of General\nMotors, for the preliminary design phase of this program. These seven s e t s of engine\ncharacteristics are shown in table I. Designs of these engines were done in such detail\nthat those considerations in mechanical arrangement, flow-path configuration, and eomponent design which would lead to selection of a single quiet engine candidate could be\nidentified for a more detailed design analysis.\nThe seven preliminary designs provided good basis for comparison of several engine\nmechanical design features and their influence on size, weight, and predicted noise output\nof the engines. Air flow-path considerations, mechanical arrangement, and component\noperating problems were identified for two- and three-spool engines, for one- and two-fan\nstages, and even for the unconventional concept of counterrotating fan stages.\nThroughout these preliminary designs, the presently known design features for fan\nquieting were applied. Fan inlet guide vanes were avoided. Fan mechanical speeds giving\nsubsonic blade relative velocities were maintained. Fan rotor-to-stator spacing was made\nas great as practically feasible. No detailed fan aerodynamic designs were made in these\npreliminary studies; thus, only the major effects of fan slowing and spacing were\ninvestigated.\nSchematic arrangements of the resulting designs for the four engines at bypass ratio\n5.0 are shown in figures 2 to 5. The predicted noise levels quoted in these figures are\npeak values for a four-engine airplane at take-off power during a flyover at an altitude of\n1000 feet and for approach power at an altitude of 300 feet. The corresponding total noise\nand 118 and 100 PNdB on approach. None of these noise levels assume the use of acoustic suppression materials in the engine nacelles.\n\n265\n\nComparison of the characteristics of these bypass ratio 5.0 engines reveals these\nfacts about the fan configurations studied:\n(1) A two-stage fan, properly spaced out for noise purposes, causes an engine to be\nvery long and heavy.\n(2) Based upon the fan noise prediction techniques available today, a two-stage fan\n\nwould be somewhat noisier than its single-stage equivalent.\nThe second point mentioned is very important to the development of a quiet turbofan\nengine. Both contractors agreed in their noise predictions (and NASA has found no data\nto dispute them) that the two-stage fan must be at least 3 decibels noisier than a singlestage fan without inlet guide vanes. The point in question is the influence that the level of\naerodynamic loading has on the noise output of a blade now, since each stage of the twostage fan can be more lightly loaded than a single-stage fan which does the same work.\nAt this time it is predicted that the quietest fan will be a single-stage fan.\nThe counterrotating two-stage fan has been dropped from further immediate consideration because considerable development time and effort would be required to supply\nthe aerodynamic design data needed for incorporation of such a fan into an operating\nengine system.\nThe two-stage fan noise and weight penalty considerations tend to rule out an engine\nlower in bypass ratio than about 5.0 as a candidate for a quiet engine. The turbofan cycle\nenergy balance causes low bypass ratio to optimize with higher fan pressure ratio, both\nfor low jet noise and for best fuel economy. A single-stage fan cannot be designed to produce a high fan pressure ratio greater than about 1.60, particularly when mechanical\nspeed of the fan rotor is being kept low for noise reasons. The quiet engine should have\na bypass ratio somewhat greater than 5.0, therefore, to give near-optimum cycle performance with the single-stage fan and to gain the jet-exhaust velocity and jet-noise reductions attainable with the higher bypass ratio.\nEngines of higher than 6.0 bypass ratio were dropped from consideration in this\nengine definition program because of installation and noise output considerations. The\nfans of very high bypass engines must be very large, as can be seen in figure 1, so that\ninstallation under the wings of the current four-engine jet transports would be difficult\nand integration into new airplane designs would be a severe problem. Also, the aerodynamic drag penalty associated with the large nacelle body housing of such an engine tends\nto counterbalance the fuel economy advantages of higher bypass ratio. Secondly, the study\nresults for Pratt & Whitney engine C indicated very little jet and fan noise improvement\nfor an 8.0-bypass-ratio engine compared with that for the 5.0-bypass-ratio engine with a\nsingle-stage fan.\n\n266\n\nAnother consideration in choice of mechanical configuration developed from our\ndesign studies for the several engines. It became apparent that the most desirable spool\narrangement for a quiet engine would be one which isolated the fan, apart from any compressor stages, on the low pressure rotor. The fan drive turbine is compromised in work\noutput per stage and in stage efficiency because of the low rotational speed imposed by fan\nspeed limitations f o r noise reasons. If the low turbine is made to produce only the work\nrequired by the fan and no core engine compressor work, the engine benefits in size,\nweight, and performance. Isolation of the fan spool also allows modification of the aerodynamic design of the fan, to slow it down or speed it up, o r even to change its size and\nbypass ratio, independently of the core engine. Major changes i n core compressor and\nturbine design need not be made with each modification in fan design as an engine is developed aerodynamically, mechanically, and acoustically.\nOn the basis of these considerations, it was determined that the engines to be\ndesigned in more detail under our definition program would have a bypass ratio between\n5.0 and 6.0, would use a single-stage fan operating at low speed on an isolated rotor spool,\nand would incorporate the rotor-to-stator spacings found feasible in the preliminary\ndesigns. Specific descriptions of the two engines resulting from the subsequent design\nwork a r e included in reference 1.\n\nNASA has required that the selection of quiet engine cycle characteristics, mechanical arrangement, and component designs be made with minimum noise output as a major\nconstraint. It has been apparent from the start that design for attainment of low noise\noutput will unfavorably affect the engine in size, weight, and perhaps, performance. Sacrifices in these areas a r e inevitable when the f a n is limited in speed, the blade rows are\nspaced out, and turbine inlet temperatures a r e limited on take-off because of noise considerations. On the other hand, the engine resulting from these studies is intended to be\nan operational and completely usable power plant for subsonic jet transports. In order\nthat the goal of airframe compatibility might be upheld and that the question of the possibility of quiet engine "retrofit" on today\'s airliners might be answered, NASA initiated\nan engine/airframe integration study program with Douglas Aircraft Company (Contract\nno. NAS3- 11151). This program parallels the engine definition program; thus, installation\nconsiderations can be used in engine selection decisions.\nThe Douglas program began in January of this year. The first task in that study\nprovided preliminary nacelle and pylon design for installation of a single-stage-fan version of a 5.0-bypass-ratio quiet engine on the DC-8 model 61. Fan-inlet and fan-discharge\nduct suppressors were included in the nacelle design s o that realistic installed-engine\nweights and dimensions f o r a very quiet power plant would be maintained. Figure 6 shows\nthe resulting installation on the inboard position of the DC-8 wing. The study ascertained\nthat engine integration was possible, that ground clearance was adequate, and that no\n267\n\nmodifications to the airframe would be required for installation of an engine of this size\nand weight.\nThe second task i n the Douglas program involved analytical determination of performance of the DC-8 with this preliminary engine and comparison with the present airplane configuration. Some results of this performance study follow:\nWeight increase of 6720 lb per airplane\n1800-foot shorter take-off field length\nNo cruise Mach number decrement\n400-mile better range at volume-limited payload\n2000-foot higher initial cruise altitude\nMinimum retrofit cost\n\n4 million dollars\n\nIt is a heartening fact that no serious compromises in airplane performance result from\nreplacing the current DC-8 power plant with the larger and heavier quiet engine. Indeed,\ngeneral improvement is expected in range, take-off distance, and initial cruise altitude.\nThe economics of engine retrofit however a r e formidable. The replacement of four\nengines, nacelles, and pylons will cost at least $4 000 000.\nSubsequent tasks in the integration program involve determination of detailed performance and retrofit information for the final selected engine configuration from the\nengine definition program. Aerodynamic model tests a r e being conducted with the DC-8\nquiet engine configuration in the Ames 12-foot-high Reynolds number tunnel and the Ames\n11-foot transonic tunnel. Flutter tests a r e being performed to determine whether wing\nstructural modifications would be required because of aeroelastic limitations. Detailed\ncosts of nacelle and pylon retrofit kits and the costs of retrofit labor and out-of-service\ntime are being determined. Operating costs for the airplane with quiet engines are being\npredicted.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nNothing to date in the engine definition and engine integration studies has indicated\nthat the goal of producing an engine system which can be both significantly quieter i n\noperation than current turbofan engines and completely compatible with subsonic transport airplane systems is being compromised.\nREFERENCE\n\n1.
