The SMMR is a ten-channel instrument flown also on the SEASAT satellite (now defunct) and was designed to measure SST in addition to other oceanographic and meteorological parameters. The three SMMR data sets were referred to as SMMR-I, -II, and -III. SMMR-I and -II were produced by T. Wilheit and A. Milman, SMMR-II being an updated and refined version of SMMR-I. A description of the algorithms used is provided. SMMR-III was provided by C. Prabhakara and was obtained by a different retrieval approach from the others. For consistency with the file code conventions and to avoid confusion, SMMRs I, II, and III were renamed SMMR-A, SMMR-D, and SMMR-C, respectively.", "title": "Satellite data", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T23:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840013892, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Njoku, E.
