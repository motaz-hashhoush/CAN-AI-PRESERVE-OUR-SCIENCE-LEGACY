SOFIA's current instrument suite includes: FORCAST (Faint Object InfraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope), a 5-40 \u03bcm dual band imager/grism spectrometer developed at Cornell University; HIPO (High-speed Imaging Photometer for Occultations), a 0.3-1.1 micron imager built by Lowell Observatory; FLITECAM (First Light Infrared Test Experiment CAMera), a 1-5 micron wide-field imager/grism spectrometer developed at UCLA; FIFI-LS (Far-Infrared Field-Imaging Line Spectrometer), a 42-210 micron IFU grating spectrograph completed by University Stuttgart; and EXES (Echelon-Cross- Echelle Spectrograph), a 5-28 micron high-resolution spectrometer being completed by UC Davis and NASA Ames. A second generation instrument, HAWC+ (Highresolution Airborne Wideband Camera), is a 50-240 micron imager being upgraded at JPL to add polarimetry and new detectors developed at GSFC. SOFIA will continually update its instrument suite with new instrumentation, technology demonstration experiments and upgrades to the existing instrument suite. This paper details instrument capabilities and status as well as plans for future instrumentation, including the call for proposals for 3rd generation SOFIA science instruments.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Canada", "submissionId": 20140016824, "endDate": "2014-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "Bellingham, WA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "1eda26694452472b8ca2de9e616f9fc4", "id": "0e2d4d18c3c44d50aaf84271e897a1c5"}], "name": "Ground-based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy", "location": "Montreal, Quebec", "id": "1eda26694452472b8ca2de9e616f9fc4", "startDate": "2014-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140016824, "id": "c17c42221f3c458daccaffb8c8654788", "publicationDate": "2014-06-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140016824.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140016824/downloads/20140016824.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140016824/downloads/20140016824.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140016824/downloads/20140016824.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
