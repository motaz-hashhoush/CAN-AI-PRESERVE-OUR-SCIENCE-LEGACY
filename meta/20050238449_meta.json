Three general categories of potential components were considered-fan blades, booster and compressor blades, and stator airfoils. Based on perceived contributions to improving engine efficiency, the fan blade was chosen as the primary application for a more detailed assessment. A high-level aerodynamic assessment using a GE90-90B Block 4 engine cycle and fan blade geometry indicates that blade camber changes of approximately +/-4deg would be sufficient to result in fan efficiency improvements nearing 1 percent. Constraints related to flight safety and failed mode operation suggest that use of the baseline blade shape with actuation to the optimum cruise condition during a portion of the cycle would be likely required. Application of these conditions to the QAT fan blade and engine cycle was estimated to result in an overall fan efficiency gain of 0.4 percent.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050238449, "id": "6b254245a7884d66b2ae38665b0f14a0", "publicationDate": "2005-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050238449.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050238449/downloads/20050238449.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050238449/downloads/20050238449.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050238449/downloads/20050238449.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
