b'Light Source\n\nI\n\n71\nRESEARCH ON FOOD\nGROWTH FOR LONG\nDURATION SPACECRAFT\nYIELDS A LIGHT\nSOURCE FOR GROWING\nPLANTS INDOORS\n\nresearch on light\nsources for promoting\nfood growth in a\nclosed environment,\nsuch as a space\nstation or a long duration manned spacecraft. The kind of\nlighting used in plant\nresearch facilities on\nEarth has many drawbacks for space use,\nnotably short lifespan,\npoor energy efficiency and too much heat\noutput. WCSAR and\nlgnatiuS began expern the toppboto is a beam"\nimenting with LEDs, which\nsolid state light source\noffer high energy efficiency and\nconsisting of a control unit\ngive off virtually no heat;\nand a lamp. The hand covering research had\nthe lamp evidences that the\nshown that red\nbox-like red light source is\nLED wavelengths\nputting out very little heat\nare very effective\nalthough it is generating high\nin promoting\nintensity radiation. Used as a\nplant growth and\nlight source for plant growth\nphotosynthesis\nand photosynthesis research,\n(atright is a\nWCSAR experithe QBeam is marketed by\nQuantum Devices, Inc.
