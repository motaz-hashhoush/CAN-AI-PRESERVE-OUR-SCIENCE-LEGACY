b'33\nTHE DREAM OF A NATION\n\nAlfred0 Martinez\n"We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for\npeaceful economic and scientific gain. Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop a\npermanently manned Spage Station and to do it within a decade."--President Ronald\nReagan in the State of the Union Message, Jan. 5, 1984.\nThe clock is ticking. The President set the deadline: Do it within a decade.\nThe assignment: Develop a permanently manned Space Station.\nThe goal: Some 3,600 days from now, the United States will possess a permanent human-built island in orbit on which men and women can live and work.\nPAST HISTORY\n#.\n\nThe history of America\'s manned space program for the past two and a half\ndecades has been built upon a series of logical steps. Man\'s first trips into space were\nshort, daring feats made by men of unsurpassed skill and courage. They went into\nspace for one reason--to determine if man could survive in its hostile environment.\nSpurred by presidential direction that America should land a man on the moon\nand return him safely to the Earth, longer space flights were conducted to prove that\nman could perform the intricate maneuvers that would be required to achieve a lunar\nlanding. Finally, the goal was reached. Man, for a short period, inhabited another\nheavenly body.\nAt the twilight of the moon-landing missions, America\'s space program came to\na crossroad. It was time to chart a new course--a course that would demonstrate man\ncould not only function effectively in space, but could exploit it for the benefit of all\nmankind as well.\nEven before man took his first cautious steps into space, he had dreamed of a\npermanent outpost in orbit which could be used for observing the Earth and the heavens, or as a jumping off spot for missions to other planets and galaxies. America\'s first\nspace station was called Skylab, a converted third stage of a left-over moon rocket.\nThe modest orbiting laboratory was in space three months, proving that man could live\nand work in space.\nThe cost of getting to orbit was expensive. Apollo had been performed with\ncostly, one-shot throwaway rockets. For space to be fully exploited, a vehicle had to\nbe built that would make it easier to get to space, and cheaper to put things up there.\nThe Space Shuttle was developed, and today teams of men and women travel into\nspace regularly. They manufacture pure drugs and grow large crystals that could lead\n\n43\n\nto medical breakthroughs, and work with supercomputers. They study the Earth\'s land\nmass and oceans, and observe the stars and the planets.\nPeople have accomplished much in the brief span of time since they first began\nexploring space, yet they have really only scratched the surface. More than a quarter\ncentury has passed since the first rocket was launched from Cape Canaveral, yet the\nactual time spent in orbit, experimenting and learning, has been but a fraction of that.\nThe visits are too brief. A permanent facility in orbit is necessary to permit the long\nduration of time that work in space requires. A permanently manned Space Station is\nthe next logical step.\nIn the State of the Union message, President Reagan announced a new, imaginative and far-reaching plan for America\'s space program, a plan that will carry the\nprogram well into the 21st century.\nHe directed NASA to develop a permanently manned Space Station and to do\nit within a decade.\nThe President\'s Space Station directive underscores a national commitment to\nmaintaining United States leadership in space. Such leadership is essential, for\nAmerica has become dependent upon operations in space for communications,\nresource analysis, and weather reports; for the conduct of science and the development of new technologies; and for the national security of our country. Space is no\nlonger an unknown, unreachable environment. It is simply a place to conduct useful\nactivities. A place for men and women to live, work, and learn.\nContinued U.S. leadership in space is but one reason why a Space Station\nshould be built. A Space Station will add significantly to knowledge of our own planet\nand the universe we live in. A Space Station will stimulate technology resulting in\n"spin-offs" that improve the quality of life for people everywhere. A Space Station will\ncreate jobs and maintain our nation\'s skilled industrial base. A Space Station will\nimprove our country\'s competitive stance at a time when more high technology products are being purchased overseas. And a Space Station will be a source of pride for\nall Americans and a visible symbol of our nation\'s ability to carry out complex scientific\nand engineering endeavors.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS A SPACE STATION?\nThe Space Station, as envisioned by NASA, will be a permanent, multipurpose\nfacility in orbit. It will serve as a laboratory to conduct basic research, an observatory\nto look down at the Earth or peer out into the sky, a garage to fix and service other\nspacecraft, a manufacturing plant to make exotic metal alloys, superpure\npharmaceuticals or perfect crystals, an assembly plant to build structures too large to fit\nin the Shuttle\'s cargo bay, and a storage warehouse to keep spare parts or even entire\nrep1aceme nt sateIlites .\nThe Space Station concept provides for both manned and unmanned elements.\nThe manned facility, as well as an unmanned free-flying platform, will be placed in a\nlow Earth orbit of about 300 miles at an inclination to the equator of 28.5 degrees. Two\n44\n\nor more platforms in high inclination or polar orbits will be launched and serviced by\nthe Space Shuttle.\nThe initial Station will support a crew of six to eight people with crew rotation\nand resupply from the Space Shuttle at approximately three-month intervals. In addition to living quarters, the facility will provide utilities (electrical power, thermal control,\nattitude control and data processing), work space, and a docking hub to allow tending\nby the Space Shuttle. The modules will be able to support scientific research and\ntechnology development requiring crew interaction.\nThe unmanned platforms will be able to provide changeable payload accommodations for activities requiring minimum disturbance and protection from contamination. A maximum of common subsystems such as power, thermal, docking, and\ndata will be used both on the Space Station and the platforms. The co-orbiting platform will be tended and serviced from the Space Station. Modules will be designed\nand prefabricated on Earth. These will then be transported to orbit in the Shuttle\'s\nbus-size cargo bay. There, they will be unloaded and assembled by astronauts\nwearing space suits and propelling themselves with jet-powered backpacks.\nWhile orbiting at an altitude of about 250 miles, these crews will use cranes and\nother tools designed especially for work in space.\nOne module will be furnished as living quarters for from six to eight persons;\nanother module (or modules) will be outfitted as a combination workshop and laboratory. Environmental conditions inside the modules, resembling the interior of a passenger airplane cabin, will enable crews to work in Earthlike shirt-sleeve surroundings.\nOther attached modules will carry utilities such as power generating machinery\nand still others will provide storage space for supplies and equipment. The Station will\nbe self-sustaining for several weeks or even months. It will be partly independent from\nground control. Crew members will have considerable discretion in their use of the\nfacilities and in scheduling and carrying out their work.\nAttached outside the modules will be platforms called pallets for automated and\nremote-controlled experiments and observation instruments. Other instruments will be\ncarried on unattached free-flying platforms in separate orbits nearby.\nThese unmanned portions of the Space Station complex will be important for\nexperiments and observation requiring protection from the contamination and vibration\nwhich are inevitably present in an inhabited spacecraft. These platforms are also necessary for maintenance, adjustments, repairs and retrieval.\nAt intervals of several weeks, the Space Shuttle will arrive at the Station to\ndeliver a replacement crew and new supplies. Some or all of the old crew members\nwill then return to Earth in the Shuttle.\n\n45\n\nSCIENCE ACTIVITIES PLANNED\nAmong their numerous activities aboard the Station, crews will carry out basic\nresearch in medicine, astronomy, space physics and solar studies. They will conduct\nexperiments in Earth sciences and in many other scientific disciplines. The crews will\nalso work on technology experiments aimed at developing products and services\nuseful for industrial customers and consumers.\nSpecially trained crew members will make Earth resources observations. 0thers will check out and launch automated spacecraft to higher orbits. Some crew members will provide in-orbit maintenance, repair and retrofit services for scientific and\napplications satellites.\nOne of the Space Station\'s crucial assignments will be to serve as a national\nlaboratory. It is to be a center for the inception and development of the advanced\ntechnologies upon which our nation\'s economic and social well-being depends in an\nincreasingly competitive and sophisticated world.\nThe intermittent visits of astronauts to Earth orbit will no longer suffice in the final\nyears of this century, if our nation is to retain its preeminence in space. Sustaining\nAmerica\'s competitive edge in technology, from which we derive our standard of living,\nrequires continuing renewal and advancement. The Space Station will help us do\nthis. It will become a key element in our nation\'s technological investment strategy as\nwe approach the 21st century.\n\nSPACE ADAPTATION\nMedical research will play an important role in the early phase of the Space\nStation era. Through research the industrialization of the later Space Station years\nwill be made practical. For the time being, however, early medical research must concern itself with the "potentially serious" physical changes of the crew members repeatedly exposed to long-term periods of microgravity in order to prevent the occurrence of\nenvironment-induced occupational disease.\nAn issue of concern is adaptation vs acclimatization. Adaptation may be\ndefined as that adaptive characteristic to an environment exhibited by living organisms\nthrough many generations of residence in a particular environment. Acclimatization is\nthe process living organisms, that are adapted to a unique environment, use to adapt\nduring exposure to a new environment which enables them to survive.\nUnderstanding human adaptation to the Space Station environment and the\nimplementation of appropriate medical research are a high priority. Previous spaceflight experience indicates that microgravity can present some physiological changes\nto crewmembers in such areas as calcium homeostasis, cardiovascular adaptation,\nmuscle atrophy, physical deconditioning, space motion sickness, drug pharmacodynamic changes, radiobiology, metabolic functions, environmental factors, red blood\n\n46\n\ncell alterations, fluid and electrolyte changes, immunological alterations, pulmonary\nfunction, oral health, and microbial contamination.\nThe state-of-the-art equipment on board the Human Research Facility (HRF)\nand the dedicated scientist-technicians will enable in-depth research which should\nproduce statistically valid data on physiological adjustments of humans to\nmicrogravity. The goal of the research on board the HRF is to obtain a better definition\nof each problem and an understanding of the underlying mechanisms which will\nultimately lead to prevention of the problems encountered by today\'s spaceflight\nparticipants.\nCONCLUSION\nA challenging new era is under consideration and on its way. With it, come new\nproblems and questions to solve and answer. Nevertheless, positive thinking is\nrequired of all those who participate in or share part of the Space Station\'s responsibility. Hence, no longer is space an unknown, unreachable environment. It is simply a\nplace for men and women to live, work, and learn.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nNASA FACTS--by John F.
