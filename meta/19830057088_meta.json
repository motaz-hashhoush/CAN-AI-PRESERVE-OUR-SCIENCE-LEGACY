The Skylab, Geos-3, and Seasat spacecraft all carried altimeters for observing ocean topography, wind speed, and wave height from space. Data were gathered on the geoid and gravity anomalies over ocean areas, leading to determinations of the mesoscale variability of the oceans and a preliminary data base on ocean circulation. Satellite altimeters are currently accurate to 2 cm over a period of several years, and radial errors have been reduced to 50 cm with Seasat. Mean sea surfaces are measured with decimeter accuracy, a level of precision expected for altimetry when improved Doppler tracking, laser tracking, and the introduction of a GPS-based tracking system are implemented. The Shuttle is regarded as a prime vehicle for testing new altimetry techniques.", "title": "Satellite altimetry", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T16:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830057088, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Marsh, J.
