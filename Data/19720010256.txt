In fulfilling these tasks, NSSDC has become an information center as well as a data center. This document, containing\nthe scientific results of and information about the Interplanetary\nMonitoring Platform (IMP) spacecraft series, has been generated using\nthe NSSDC information base and, particularly, the Technical Reference\nFile (TRF) maintained at NSSDC. The TRF is a part of the NSSDC information base and contains references to published papers and unpublished\nreports related to space science experiments.\nSome of the spacecraft-related information presented here was provided to NSSDC by IMP project personnel at Goddard Space Flight Center\nat the time of the generation of this document. For this we are grateful. We would also like to acknowledge the cooperation of personnel in\nthe IMP Project Office and of those IMP experimenters who reviewed preliminary versions of the spacecraft and experiment descriptions and the\nbibliographic entries and abstracts in December of 1970.\nIt is anticipated that subsequent editions of this IMP report will\nbe published as sufficiently more published papers using IMP data become available.\n\niii\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nCONTENTS\n\nFOREWORD\n\nill\n\nI.

In\naddition, measurements taken in distant magnetospheric regions, the bow\nshock, the magnetosheath, the magnetopause, and the magnetotail have\nbeen crucial to our understanding of those regions.\nIt is the purpose of this document to summarize the main characteristics of the IMP spacecraft and experiments from a scientific rather\nthan technological point of view and to present the scientific knowledge\ngained from this series of spacecraft in the form of abstracts of scientific papers using IMP data.\nThe document is divided into two parts. In the first part, spacecraft characteristics, including temporal and spatial coverages, are\npresented and are followed by a bibliography containing abstracts from\nspacecraft-related papers. In the second part, experiments on all IMPs\n(including prelaunch IMPs -H and -J) are described. Figures are presented showing the time histories, through the end of 1970, of magnetic\nfield, plasma, and energetic particle experiments. A bibliography containing abstracts is presented for each experiment on each spacecraft\nfrom IMP A through IMP G. Wherever possible, the abstracts given here\nfor spacecraft- and experiment-related papers are by the originating\nauthors.\n\nII.\n\nSPACECRAFT\n\nNomenclature\nBecause the entire IMP series of spacecraft is a subset of the\nExplorer series and; because two of the IMPs were to have been anchored\nto a lunar orbit, the names of.the IMP spacecraft may be somewhat confusing. For clarification, a list of names and launch dates is presented in Table 1.\nTable 1 - IMP Spacecraft Names and Launch Dates\nIMP\n\nExplorer\n\nIMP\n\nA\nB\n\n18\n21\n\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nI\nH\nJ\n\n28\n33\n35\n34\n41\n43\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nAIMP\n\nAIMP\n\nLaunch (UT)\n11/27/63\n\nD\nE\n\n4\n5\n6\n\n1*\n2**\n\n10/04/64\n05/29/65\n07/01/66\n07/19/67\n05/24/67\n06/21/69\n03/13/71\nplanned 72\nplanned 73\n\n*Lunar orbit intended but not achieved.\n**Lunar orbit achieved.\nBefore launch, IMP spacecraft are known by their letter codes; after\nlaunch, an Explorer number and an IMP (or AIMP) number is assigned. In\nmany cases, a spacecraft is referred to by its prelaunch designation\neven after launch. Because the prelaunch designations, constitute the\nmost continuous sequence of names in the IMP series, reference to individual spacecraft by their prelaunch designations is made throughout\nthis report.\nGeneral Characteristics\nThe IMP spacecraft have been grouped here by their characteristics,\nwith IMPs A, B, C, D, and E forming one group, IMPs F and G another, and\nIMPs I, -H, and -J a third.\n\nIMPs A through E shared numerous characteristics. Each weighed\nabout 62 kg and utilized about 38 w average power provided by solar\ncells and chemical batteries. Slight differences existed among individual spacecraft. Exclusive of appendages (antennas, experiment\nbooms, etc.), each spacecraft was shaped as an octagonal drum 71 cm\nacross; IMPs A through C were about 30.5 cm high, while IMPs D and E\nwere only 18 cm high. Each spacecraft except IMP D carried seven active experiments; IMP D carried six active experiments. The PFM data\ntelemetry bit rate was increased from about 10 bps on IMPs A, B, and\nC to about 28 bps on IMPs D and E. Of. these spacecraft, IMP E continues to operate.\nIMPs F and G were more complex than IMPs A through E, carrying 11\nand 12 active experiments, respectively. Their configurations and their\npower consumptions were similar to those of the IMPs A through C. They\nweighed 74 and 80 kg, respectively, and the telemetry bit rate for both\nwas 100 bps. IMP F entered the earth\'s atmosphere in May 1969; IMP G\ncontinues to operate.\nIMP I represents the most significant increase in complexity in\nthe IMP series. This spacecraft is a 16-sided drum, 135 cm across and\n183 cm high. It weighs about 278 kg, uses about 110 w average power,\nand has a 1600-bps data telemetry rate. It carries 12 active experiments. IMPs -H and -J will be similar in configuration to IMP I.\nSpacecraft Attitude\nAll IMP spacecraft were spin stabilized and used an optical aspect\nsystem for determining spin rate, spin phase, and spin axis direction.\nIn addition, each spacecraft beginning with IMP D had a sun pulse generator to yield spin phase information required for the onboard sectoring of data on some experiments. The optical aspect systems and the\nsun pulse generators worked well throughout the useful life of each IMP,\nexcept on IMP F (failure occurred 2 months before spacecraft reentry).\nThe intended spin axis directions were achieved within reasonable\nlimits for each IMP except IMP B. The spin axis of IMP D lay approximately in the ecliptic plane, while the spin axes of IMPs E, G, and I\nare approximately normal to the ecliptic plane, as was the spin axis\nof IMP F. Table 2 indicates the ranges, in degrees, over which the\nIMP spin axes have varied in the customary inertial earth-equatorial\ncoordinate system. Also included in Table 2 are the corresponding\nangular ranges in inertial ecliptic coordinates. The two coordinate\nsystems share a common X axis (i.e. , from the earth to the sun at the\ntime of the vernal equinox). Note that the declination angle, in\necliptic coordinates, measures the extent to which the spin vector lies\noutside of ecliptic plane. Table 2 also shows the approximate limits\nwithin which the IMP spin rates have varied over spacecraft lifetimes.\n\nTable 2 - IMP Spacecraft Spin Directions and Rates\n\nIMP\n\nRight\nRight\nAscension\nAscension\nDeclination\n(equatorial) (equatorial) (ecliptic)\n(deg)\n(deg)\n(deg)\n\nDeclination\n(ecliptic)\n(deg)\n\nSpin Rate\n(rpm)\n\n-44 to -52\n\n22.0 to 25.8\n\nA\n\n117 to 107\n\n-24 to -31\n\nB\n\n44 to 49\n\n47 to 58\n\n57 to\n\n62\n\n29 to 39\n\n14.4 to 18.0\n\nC\n\n65 to\n\n77\n\n- 9 to -14\n\n61 to\n\n74\n\n-32 to -36\n\n17.4 to 27.5\n\nD\n\n215 to 246\n\n-21 to -15\n\n219 to 258\n\n- 6 to 15\n\n17.5 to 26.5\n\nE\n\n74 to 107\n\n-55 to -73\n\n0 to 360\n\n-83 to -89\n\n24.5 to 26.4\n\nF\n\n79 to\n\n95\n\n-62 to -69\n\n0 to 360\n\n-83 to -89\n\n23.2 to 22.5\n\n103 to 119\n\n-61 to -68\n\n156 to 206\n\n-78 to -85\n\n27.5 to 27.0\n\nG\n\n111 to 125\n\n-90\n5.4\n\xe2\x80\x94\n*The angles are nominal initial values; the spin rate is as observed.\nI*\n\n90\n\n-66\n\nTime Coverage\nThe time intervals of principal data coverage for each launched\nIMP spacecraft are shown in Figure 1. Note the nearly continuous\ncharacter of the IMP time coverage.\nSpatial Coverage\nIMPs A, B, C, F, G, and I were to have achieved highly eccentric\nearth orbits with apogee distances of a few 10\'s of earth radii. IMPs\nD and E were to have achieved lunar orbits, and IMPs -H and -J are\nscheduled for nearly circular earth orbits at 30 to 40 earth radii.\nThus far, only IMPs B and D failed to achieve their intended orbits;\nhowever, these IMPs, like the others, have returned much useful data.\nThe approximate limits within which selected orbital parameters have\nvaried during spacecraft lifetimes are shown in Table 3. Because IMP\nD was subjected to significant lunar perturbations, many of its characteristics are shown separately in Figure 2. Note that the abscissa\nfor this figure varies linearly with orbit number rather than with time.\nDetailed time histories of the standard orbit elements are available\nfrom NSSDC.\n\nC\\J\n\ntx-OOOOOO\xe2\x80\x94\n\n00\n0)\n\n,0\n\nSS2SSS&8\nI\n\n8\nI\n\nI I I\n\n00\nVO\n\nor\nLU\n>I I I I I I I I\n<mUOLuu-Ox\n\n2\nctf\n\np.\nC/3\n\nOS\n\n/\n0\n\n^\n\n"-- < S\'\n\nLU Q\xc2\xa3 J^\n\nin\n\no; \xe2\x80\x94 - uj !5\nUJ CO 0 >\ng\n5; < o o >\n\n0 z Zt\n\n-\n\nlSS|i\no\n\nO)\n\no\n\ni i*\n\n00\nVO\n\n<\nQ-\n\nCD O\nQ_\nD-\n\nUJ\n\nu _ c j 3 " ~\n\nIMPD\n\'\n\nR\n\nA\n\n1\n\n30 20 -\n\n...\n\nQ\n\n\'\n\n\'\n*\n\n- 40\n\n*\n\n10 - 180\n0_\n-10 160\n-20\n-30 _\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\ \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2..\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*\n\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 *\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 .\n\n*+ *\n+\n4-+,\n**+\n\nt\n\n+***+*+\no\n*o\xc2\xb0\n\n+\n\n*\n\n\'*\no\xc2\xb0\nA+ ++\n+\no\n*\n\n++*++*+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n0\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\xc2\xb0\n\xc2\xb0\n\n*\xc2\xb0\n\n- 10\n\nox\nx\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"\n\no\xc2\xb0\n\ny\n\nxx\n\n)( x w\n\n0\n\no\n\n60 r\n\nYEAR\n\n\xc2\xb0\nvX\n\no**\nX\n\nXX.X\n\nXuX V\nX *\n\n-\n\nXXX0\n\no\xc2\xb0\n\n180\n(NOON)\n\n-\n\nOxX\n\ni\n\n270\n(DAWN)\n\nV\n\n0\n\no\n\xc2\xae\n\nX. \xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\no\xc2\xb0\n\n0\n\n0\nv\n\n-\n\no\n0o\n\n0\n\n(MIDNIGHT)\n\no\n\no\xc2\xb0\n\n100 r\n\nX\n\n6\n\n^~\n\n**\n\n(j\n\n90\n(DUSK)\n\n0\n\no\n\n0\n(MIDNIGHT)\n\n[ iii^aliSiiil =^^=iiiiiiiiiii3iiiiii3232Siiiiii3iS2iiSi-*5si*iJi5isj^\n\n1 6\n9 6\n\n1 6\n9 7\n\n1 6 1969 1970\n9 8\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA: GEOCENTRIC SOUR ECLIPTIC LATITUDE OF APOGEE POINT (deg)\n\nx\n\nR: RADIAL DISTANCE OF APOGEE POINT (RE)\n\no\n\nQ: LOCAL TIME OF APOGEE POINT (deg)\n\n+\n\n20\n\n360\n\nx\n\n\xc2\xb0\no\xc2\xb0\n\n0\n\n80\n\n.\n\n* ******** **+ ++\n\n++\n\n120\n\nAPOGEE\nDAY\nNUMBER ( UT)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2~ 30\n\n. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2*\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\xa2* .\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n>\xc2\xbb.\n\xe2\x80\xa2f\n\n-40 - 140\n\nP\n\nKn\nOU\n\n..\n\nP: ORBITAL PERIOD (days)\n\nFigure 2 - IMP D Spacecraft Orbital Parameters\n\nTable 3 - IMP Spacecraft Orbital Parameter Variations\n\nIMP\n\nApogee\nRadial Distance\n(RE)\n\nPeriod\n(days)\n\nI (deg)*\n\nEccentricity\n\n\xc2\xa5 (deg)**\n\nA\n\n31.4 to 31.6\n\n3.8 to 3.9\n\n46 to 50\n\n.90 to .95\n\n-8 to -5\n\nB\n\n15.8 to 15.9\n\n1.4 to 1.5\n\n48 to 53\n\n.86 to .87\n\n-20 to -9\n\nC\n\n36.5 to 41.8\n\n5.8 to 5.9\n\n68 to 72\n\n.70 to .95\n\n-20 to +10\n\n21 to 39\n\n.48 to .82\n\n-35 to +2.5\n\nD***\n\n64 to 140\n\n11.5 to 44\n\n11\n\n1.5++; 61\n\n0.48 ; 27.3\n\n166; 5.1\n\n.56; .05\n\nF\n\n33.4 to 34.0\n\n4.3 to 4.4\n\n89 to 93\n\n.91 to .94\n\n-5 to +8\n\nG#\n\n28.2 to 28.6\n\n3.3 to 3.4\n\n89 to 96\n\n.90 to .93\n\n-4 to 0\n\nI////\n\n32.1\n\n4.1\n\n45\n\n.94\n\nE+\n\n22\n\n*Angle I is the inclination angle of the orbit plane with respect to\nthe ecliptic plane.\n**Angle \xc2\xa5 is the angle that the line joining the earth\'s center and the\nspacecraft apogee point makes with the ecliptic plane.\n***See Figure 2 for variation with time of some of these parameters.\n+The first value in each pair is for the orbit of IMP E about the moon;\nthe second value is for the moon\'s orbit about the earth.\n"^One earth radius =3.7 lunar radii.\n//These figures are for the first year of operation only.\n////The figures are initial values.\n\nThe local times of apogee for the geocentric IMPs are shown in\nFigure 3.

It is beyond the scope of this\nreport to identify the individual time periods for which each IMP\nspacecraft was beyond a certain geocentric distance. However, using\nthe equation given in the paragraph below and the information in Table\n4, the approximate apogee times for the individual spacecraft can be\ndetermined. With this information, with the apogee distance information in Table 3, and with the apogee local time information in Figure\n3, a reasonably accurate position for any one of the IMPs at any specific time may be determined.\nThe apogee times (day number of year and fraction of that day:\nJanuary 1 day number = 1) of each of five IMP spacecraft are given by\nthe equation T = a + 3 \' (n \xc2\xb1 0.05) for the integer values of n. Table\n4 gives values of a for each spacecraft and year and values of 3 for\neach spacecraft.

Groups of detectors\non IMP 1 monitored interplanetary magnetic fields, cosmic radiation,\nand the solar wind. One rubidium vapor magnetometer and two fluxgate\nmagnetometers obtained measurements that indicated a spiral structure\nin space associated with the rotation of the sun and the efflux of\nsolar plasma. A cosmic-ray telescope investigated the He component\nof galactic cosmic rays. Ion chambers and GM counters observed lowenergy cosmic-ray protons, time variations of the total cosmic-ray\nintensity, and electrons in interplanetary space beyond the earth\'s\ninfluence. Plasma probes and a retarding potential analyzer gathered\ndata that aided in defining the transition region between the magnetopause and the shock front. Data were also gathered on the structure,\nmagnitude, and variations of magnetic fields in cislunar space beyond\nthe magnetosphere, and on the energy, spectra, fluxes, velocities,\nvariations, etc., of solar and galactic cosmic rays and the solar wind.\n\nA-02\n\nCarr, F.A., "Flight Report, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform,\nIMP-1 - Explorer 18," NASA, TN D-3352, Apr. 1966.\nFollowing a successful launch, IMP-1 operated successfully for\nsix months.

The elliptical orbit of IMP-1, reaching\n106,000 nautical miles into cislunar space, provided the 9 scientific\nexperiments with a unique opportunity to examine the outer limits of\nthe Earth\'s magnetosphere, the transition region, and interplanetary\nspace.

Based upon the magnetic test\nresults and upon the telemetered in-flight data, the design goal\n(magnetic) for the IMP-1 was achieved;\n\n12\n\nA-09\n\nPiazza, F.D., "Computer Analysis of Interplanetary\n\nMonitoring\n\nPlatform (IMP) Spacecraft Performance," NASA, TN D-3340, Mar. 1966,\nThe significant features of this method of approach are described\nin detail, and their successful application to the prelaunch phase of\nthe IMP spacecraft and of the scientific experiments assigned to the\nIMP missions are outlined. The effectiveness and advantages of this\nsystem are emphasized by the use of a compact general purpose computer\nto provide real-time telemetry data-processing \'for performance analysis.\nThe analysis during prelaunch has been greatly improved by the system\'s\nflexibility, speed, and accuracy of operation compared with methods of\nanalysis previously used. Also pointed put are the advantages of reduction in manpower needed for testing, and of mobility provided by\nhousing the system in a van. The suitability of this system is evident\nfor use with other types of spacecraft in the future, with minimal\nhardware modification. It is noted that more effective use of the\npresent system depends on the development of more sophisticated software systems for relevant data-processing.\n\nA-10\n\nRosenbaum, B., "Range Residuals in VHF Radar Tracking," NASA,\nTN D-3560, Aug. 1966.\nThe ionosphere imposes a large bias on the accuracy of tracking\nat VHF, while the irregularities in the ionospheric density add a\nfluctuating component to range tracking residuals which is about one\npercent of the principal range bias. The overall variation of these\nionospheric effects is about two orders of magnitude during the diurnal\ncycle and the eleven-year solar cycle. The range residuals of samples\nof Imp-1 tracking data are examined to detect tracking noise haying an\nionospheric origin. The data show fluctuating residuals of about 15\nmeters rms and an anomalous, systematic variation on the order of 100\nmeters, which could be attributed to the tracking system. The negligible role of ionospheric irregularities observed in range residuals\nis consistent with the current epoch of the quiet sun.\n\nA-ll\n\nStonesifer, G.R., and E.

A statistical analysis was done on these topics of concern\nand this publication relates the pertinent information established. By\ncomparing and contrasting the S-74, S-75, and S-76 satellites, various\nmethods were employed to\'indicate their data quality, frequent tracking\nstation malfunctions, and timing failures or irregularities.

The apogee achieved was 51,600 n.m.,\nwhich was less than one-half of the planned altitude. This problem\nwas attributed to the suspected failure of the igniter assembly of the\nthird-stage motor, occurring after about 16 seconds of normal burning.\nThe angle between the spacecraft spin-axis and the ecliptic plane was\nreduced by the third-stage malfunction, resulting in a wider range\nof incident sun-angles during the satellite lifetime. This caused low\npower output from the solar paddles and over-heating of the silvercadmium battery. Spacecraft performance was satisfactory until the\n+50\xc2\xb0C temperature environment (about two months after launch) caused\nthe failure of the battery. Thereafter, the spacecraft operated only\nduring periods of favorable incident sun-angles. In all, about five\nmonths of useful data was recorded. As of mid-1965, the spacecraft\nwas operating itermittently with essentially no useful data being obtained. There is some possibility that perhaps as much as a month\'s\nmore data might be obtained in the future.\n\nB-02\n\nMoe, K., D. Klein, G. Maled, and L.

Equations are derived for the calculation of Hp from spin decay and X-ray absorption. The gradient of Hp is calculated for the first time from the\ndrag on a single satellite (IMP 2). Although the trend with solar activity can be seen clearly in the best data, the most obvious conclusion is\nthat it.is, in general, very difficult to determine density scale heights\naccurately. The best method so far developed for obtaining annual averages\nis the method of King-Hele. . The best method of obtaining averages over a\nfew days is to use the spin decay of paddlewheel satellites in highly eccentric orbits. The accuracy of these two methods appears to.be 5 to 10%,\nif the possible variation in drag coefficient is ignored.\n\nB-03\n\nMoore, H .

This study arose from the relatively large transfer orbit injection errors which are associated\nwith the spin stabilized solid propellant injection motor. No midcourse correction is available; the only control parameter is the time\nof firing of the fixed-impulse lunar orbit injection motor. The\nlarge errors resulted in analysis and solutions peculiar to this mission trajectory. It was found that for the applicable vehicle errors,\nmaximum lunar orbit probability was obtained for a 72-hour flight time\nand a high injection flight path angle. A circular parking orbit\ncould not be used because of the flight path angle requirement, and\nthe available launch times were thereby restricted.

Data will be obtained\nin eight harrow frequency channels from 10 Hz to 100 kHz in either the\n\' normal mode or the snapshot mode. In the normal mode, the antenna is\nfirst sampled in a given frequency channel many times during a given\nmeasurement period (comparable to spacecraft spin period). During the\nnext period, the search coil is sampled many times in the same frequency channel. Next, the antenna is sampled in the next frequency\nchannel; followed by the search, coil in that channel. The frequency\nchannels are incremented, and the sampled sensors alternated, until\na full set of data is obtained in 16 measurement periods (20 sec).\nIn the snapshot mode, only electric field data are transmitted in the\nfollowing manner. The antenna is. first sampled in a given frequency\nchannel many times during a given measurement period. In the next\nperiod, the antenna is sampled in two sequences of eight frequency\nchannels. This two-period measurement is executed eight times, incrementing the frequency channel studied in every other period by\none each time. Thus, a full set of data again requires 16 measurement\nperiods. In addition, an analog mode sampling the antenna and search\ncoil from 10 Hz to 100 Hz is used in conjunction with the special\npurpose analog telemetry channel test to be conducted. The electric\'\nand magnetic thresholds are 10 yv/m and 3 my.\n\nJl\n\nAC Electric and Magnetic Fields\nD.A. Gurnett\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nP.S. Kellogg\n\nUniversity of Minnesota.\n\nT.L.

Bridge\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nA five-element split collector Faraday cup was used to measure\nsolar wind particles in the following sequence: positive ions from\n45 to 105 ev, positive ions from 95 to 235 ev, positive-ions;from"220\nto 640 ev, positive ions from 560 to 1800 ev, electrons from 65 to\n210 ev, and positive ions from 1700 to 5400 ev. (The split plane of\nthe collector was in the spin equatorial plane of the spacecraft.)\nMeasurements consisted of 22 instantaneous current samples, each separated by 0.16 sec (spanning more than one satellite rotation). These\nmeasurements represented the sum of the current to the split collector--;\nthe maximum difference current encountered during spacecraft rotation,\nand which half collector was maximum. The entire sequence required\n2.8 min and was repeated every 5.5 mln. The entrance cone for this ...\nFaraday cup had a half-angle of about 80\xc2\xb0. Interference was encoun- \xe2\x80\xa2\ntered from refracted particles (with the most pronounced effect at\nabout 70\xc2\xb0 incidence to cup normal), from secondary electrons, and\nfrom ultraviolet radiation. Useful data were obtained from launch\nuntil January 13, 1965. However, there was poor data coverage during\nthe last 7 months because of intermittent satellite transmission.\n\nA3\n\nGSFC Faraday Cup\nG.P. Serbu\n\n\'\'\n\n..\n\n/\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe retarding potential analyzer was a three-element planar\nFaraday cup. It was mounted normal to the spacecraft spin axis and\nhad an effective look angle of 5 ster. Coarse and fine .resolution\nmodes were programmed for both ions and electrons. These modes consisted of 15 steps each for retarding voltages of 0 to 28 and\'0 to\n100 v. The entire ion and electron sequence was repeated once every\n10.92 min, and each 15-step spectrum-analysis required 5.4 sec. The\nexperiment operated from launch for about 20 hr when failure of a\nmechanical programmer switch terminated operations. The data were\nadversely affected by secondary electrons.\n\n40\n\nA4\n\nElectrostatic Analyzer\nJ.H. Wolfe\n\nNASA/Ames Research Center\n\nA quadrispherical electrostatic analyzer with a current collector\nand an electrometer amplifier was used to detect and analyze the positive ion component of the\'incident plasma and to study its gross flow\ncharacteristics. Protons were analyzed in 14 energy channels between\n0.025\'and 16 kev. The instrument was mounted on the satellite\nequatorial plane and had a view angle of 15\xc2\xb0 in\' this plane and of 90\xc2\xb0\nin\'the plane containing the spin axis. The satellite\'s equatorial\nplane was divided into three contiguous sectors (111.8\xc2\xb0, 111.8\xc2\xb0, and\n136.-4") by use of an optical aspect sensor. The peak flux in one\nsector was recorded at one analyzer plate \'potential per revolution of\nthe satellite. (No information as to the position within the sector\nin which the peak flux occurred was retained.) After 14 revolutions,\nall energy channels had been scanned, and the process was repeated\nfor the next sector. -A complete scan in energy and sector was repeated\nevery 5.46 min. No data were obtained for the-brief periods when the\nsatellite was in the magnetosphere. The instrument operated well until\nApril 1964 when it started operating intermittently. Its operation\ncontinued to degrade thereafter.\n\nB2\n\nMIT Faraday Cup\n\nH.S. Bridge\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThis five-element Faraday cup measured electrons between 130 and\n265 ev and ions in the following five energy .windows: 40 to 90, 95 to\n230, 260 to 650, 700 to 2000, and 1700 to 5400 ev.

The satellite\'s\nequatorial plane was divided into three contiguous sectors (61\xc2\xb0, 95\xc2\xb0,\nand 204\xc2\xb0) by use of an optical aspect sensor. The peak flux in one\nsector was recorded at one analyzer plate potential per revolution of\nthe satellite.

Energy spectral analysis\nwas accomplished by charging the plates to known voltage levels and\nallowing them to discharge with known\'RC time constants. The analyzer\nhas four commandable modes. The first mode was designed for\'the measurement of solar wind prptons and alpha particles. During eight spacecraft revolutions, 32-level energy spectra were obtained in eight an- \'\ngular ranges centered on the sun? The energy levels extend from \'100 ev\nto 8 kev. The second mode was designed for the measurement of solar\nwind heavy ions. This cycle was the same as the first except that the\nenergy per charge levels were limited tb 900 v to 8 kv and the efficiency\nof counting heavy ions was increased relative tq protons and alpha particles. The third mode was designed for the measurement of solar wind\nand magnetosheath electrons and magnetosheath positive ions. This was\na combination cycle in which electron\'an^ positive ion spectral sweeps\nwere alternated. During a cycle of nine spacecraft revolutions, eight\nelectron spectra and eight positive ion spectra were obtained. The\ncombined data for electrons in this mode consisted of 16-level energy\nspectra taken in 32 evenly spaced angular ranges. The spectra extended\nfrom 4 to 1000 ev. The data for positive ions consisted of 32-level\nspectra taken in the same 32 angular ranges. The energy per charge\nspectra extended from 100 v to 8 kv.

During successive spacecraft revolutions, each of the\ntwo electrostatic analyzer deflection voltages was advanced through one\nof 20 logarithmically equispaced steps in the above stated intervals.\nComplete spectra are thus obtained in 240 sec. During each revolution,\'\ndirectional measurements were taken by each detector in 16 contiguous\n2.5\xc2\xb0 sectors centered on the satellite sun line and in six contiguous\n11.25\xc2\xb0 sectors on either side of the first sector. No measurements were\ntaken in the antisun hemisphere. The sum and the sum of squares of\ncounts in the 28 angular sectors were telemetered in both telemetry\nmodes. In addition, in the high bit rate, counts in the middle twelve\n2.5" sectors were telemetered, while in the low bit rate, the highest\ncount rate in a 2.5\xc2\xb0 sector and the sector number were telemetered.\nInitial experiment performance was normal for the first month.

The parallel and perpendicular telescopes measured the sum of\ncounts due to protons with E > 70 Mev and electrons with E > 6.5 Mev and\nthe sum of counts due to protons with E > 65 Mev and electrons with E > 6\nMev, respectively. Counts registered in any one of the four GM tubes\nwere also accumulated. These omnidirectional counts were due to protons with E-> 50 Mev plus electrons with E > 4.Mev. The parallel, perpendicular, and omnidirectional count rates were obtained for one 40-sec\naccumulation interval during successive normal, 81.9-sec telemetry sequences. Thus, any one count rate was measured for 40 sec.once each\n5.46 min. Both detector systems worked well from launch until May 11,\n1967.\n\nC7\n\nSolid-State Telescope\nJ.A. Simpson\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nA charged particle solid-state telescope was used to measure range\nand energy loss of galactic and solar cosmic rays. The experiment was\ndesigned to study particle energies (energy range is proportional to\nZ2/A; for protons: 0.9 to 190 Mev, 6.5 to 19 Mev, 19 to 90 Mev, and\n90 to 190 Mev) and charge spectra (Z < 6). The detector was oriented\nnormal to the spacecraft spin axis. The detector accumulators for each\nenergy interval were telemetered six times every 5.46 min. Each accumulation was about 40 sec long (initial spacecraft spin period was about\n3.3 sec). The output from two 128-channel pulse height analyzers was\nobtained for one incident particle every 41 sec and was read out along\nwith the detector accumulations. The experiment performed normally\nuntil April 21, 1966, after which several problems with the instrumentation developed, causing spikes in the count rate data, especially in\nthe lowest energy channel. The date of transmission of the last useful\ninformation was April 29, 1967.\n\n51\n\nD5\n\nIon Chamber and GM Counters\nK.A. Anderson\n\n,\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nThis experiment consisted of a 10.2-cm Neher type ionization chamber\nand two Geiger-Mueller tubes. The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons with E > 0.7 Mev and protons with E > 12 Mev. Bo.th GM\ntubes, were mounted perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube\nA detected electrons with E > 45 kev which were scattered off a gold\nfoil. The acceptance cone for these electrons had a full angle of 61\xc2\xb0\nand axis of symmetry which was perpendicular to the spacecraft spin\naxis. GM tube B responded to electrons and protons with E > 22 and 300\nkev,.respectively, in an acceptance cone of 45\xc2\xb0 full angle with axis\nof symmetry perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. Both GM tubes\nresponded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons with E > 2.5 and\n35 Mev, respectively. Pulses from the ion chamber and counts^from each\nGM tube were accumulated for 39.72 sec and read out every 40.96 sec.\nIn addition, the time between the first two ion chamber pulses in an\naccumulation period was telemetered. On August 1, 1967, GM tube\nB began to behave erratically and on August 9, 1967, it stopped counting. GM tube A stopped counting a few days later. The ion chamber\noperated normally from launch through September 2, 1966.\nBetween\nSeptember 2, 1966, and October 20, 1967, the date of last usable data,\nthe ion chamber operated at a lower threshold voltage.\n\nD6\n\nSolid-State and GM Counters\nJ.A. Van Allen\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThree EON type 6213 Geiger-Mueller tubes (GM1, GM2, and GM3) and\na silicon solid-state detector (SSD) provided measurements of solar\nX rays (GM tubes only, between 2 and 12 A) and of solar, galactic, and\nmagnetospheric charged particles. The GM tubes measured electrons of E\n> 45 to 50 kev and protons of E > 730 to 830 kev. The SSD output was\ndiscriminated at four thresholds: (1) pnl, which detected protons\nwith .31 < E < 10 Mev and alphas with .59 < E < 225 Mev; (2) pn2,\nwhich detected protons with .50 < E < 4 Mev and alphas with .78 < E .\n< 98 Mev; (3) pn3, which detected protons with .82 < E \xc2\xa3 1.9 Mev and\nalphas with 1.121 < E < 46 Mev; and (4) pn4, which detected alphas\nwith 2.1 < E < 17 Mev. GM1 and the SSD were oriented perpendicular to\nthe spacecraft spin axis, GM2 was oriented parallel to the spin axis,\nand GM3 was oriented antiparallel to the spin axis. Data from GM1\nand pnl were divided into data from quadrants oriented with respect to\nthe sun (sectors I, II, III, and IV centered 180\xc2\xb0, 270\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0, and 90\xc2\xb0\nfrom the sun, respectively). Data were read out .in either 82- or 164sec intervals. An intermittent, recognizable electronic failure\noccurred in the SSD starting about September 15, 1966. Accumulator\nfailures occurred on July 21, 1967, and September 24, 1967. A limited\namount of usable data was collected through the date of final spacecraft transmission (May 31, 1971)\'.\n\nE5\n\nIon Chamber and GM Counters\nK.A.

This experiment performed well initially. On November 20, 1968, the ion chamber failed; On May 9j 1969, GM tube B failed.\nGM tube A is still operating normally and returning usable information\n(February 22, 1971).\n\nE6\n\nSoiid-State and GM Counters\nJ.A. Van Allen\n\nUniversity ol Iowa\n\nThree EON type 6213 Geiger-Mueller tubes (GM1, GM2, and GM3) and\na silicon solid-state detector (SSD) provided measurements of solar\nX rays (GM1 only, between 2 and 12 A) and charged particles in the\nvicinity of the moon. GM1 and GM3 measured electrons of E >-48 to\n50 kev and protons of E > 740 to 820 kev, .while GM2 was shielded by\na cap approximately 1 g/cm2 thick (limiting its response to protons\nof E > 30 Mev). The SSD^dutput was discriminated at four\'thresholds:\n(1) pnl, which detected protons with :32 < E < 6.3 Mev, (2) pn2, which\ndetected protons :with ;48t< E < 3.6 Mev,. (3) pn4, wh\'ich detected, alphas\nwith 2 < E < 10; 2 Mev, and (4) pvn3, which was sensitive to particles\nof Z > 3, carbon 12 with .58 S E < 9;5 Mev/micleon, nitrogen l4 with\n.514 < E < 13.9 Mev/nucleoh, and oxygen 16 with .466 < E < 18.8 Mev/\nnucleon. GM1 the SSD were oriented perpendicular to the spacecraft\nspin axis, GM2 was oriented parallel to the spin axis, and.GM3 was\noriented antiparallel to the spin axis. Data from GM1, pnl, and pn4\nwere divided into data from quadrants oriented with respect to the\nsun (sectors I, II, ill, and IV centered 180\xc2\xb0, 270\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0, and 90\xc2\xb0 away\nfrom the sun, respectively). Data were read out every 82 or 164\nsec, and the .experiment performance was normal as of April 1971.\n\nF4\n\nIon Chamber and GM Counters\nK.A. Anderson\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nThe instrumentation for this experiment consisted of a 10.2-cm\nNehef type ionization chamber and two Geiger-Mueller tubes. The\nion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons with E. > 0.7 Mev\nand protons with E > 12 Mev. Both GM tubes were mounted parallel\nto the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube A detected electrons with\nE > 45 kev that were scattered off a gold foil. The acceptance cone\nfor these electrons had a 70\xc2\xb0 full angle and an axis of symmetry\nthat was 20\xc2\xb0 off the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube B responded\nto electrons and protons with E > 22 and 300 kev, respectively, in an\nacceptance cone of 70\xc2\xb0 full angle centered at the spin direction.\nBoth GM tubes responded omnidirectionally to electrons and protons\nof E > 2.5 and 50 Mev, respectively. Pulses from the ion chamber\n\n53\n\nand counts from each SI tube were accumulated for. 9.92 sec and read\nout every 10.24 sec. The time between the first two ion chamber\npulses in an accumulation period was also telemetered. This experiment\nperformed normally from launch through May 3, 1969, when IMP F reenterthe earth\'s atmosphere.\n\nF5\n\nSolar Proton Monitor\nC.O. Bostrom\n\nJohns Hopkins University/Applied\nPhysics Laboratory\n\nThe solar proton monitoring experiment utilized four separate\ndetec\xe2\x82\xacors, each of which used one or more solid-state sensors. Three\ndetectors measured the omnidirectional fluxes of protons and alpha\npafticles with energy per nucleon values above 10, 30, and 60 Mev.\nAlpha particle contributions to the total count rates were generally\nless than 10%. The 10-Mev channel was sampled for two 19.2-sec intervals every 163.8 sec, and the 30- and 60-Mev channels were sampled\nfor one 19.2-sec interval every 163.8 sec; Resultant hourly averaged\nfluxe\xc2\xa7 have been published in Solar-Geophysical Data (NOAA, Boulder)\non a rapid basis. The fourth detector had a 60\xc2\xb0 full angle normal to\nthe spacecraft spin axis. Each of two discrimination levels was\nsampled for two 19.2-sec intervals every 163.8 sec. Fluxes of 1- to\n10-Mev protons were measured in the lower discrimination state, and\nfluxes of particles depositing more than 3.6 Mev were measured in the\nupper discrimination state.\' Data were obtained from the" first three\ndetectors between launch and May 3, 1969. Data from the fourth detector were obtained between launch and June 12, 1968.\n\nF6\n\nLow Energy Solid-State Telescope\nW.L. Brown\n\nBell Telephone Laboratories\n\nA four-element solid-state telescope with an acceptance cone half\nangj.e of 20\xc2\xb0-was mounted normal to the spacecraft spin axis. During\neach 2.73-min interval, 9;82-sec accumulations were obtained in each\nof 16 distinct counting modes. These modes involved protons in five\nenergy intervals covering 0.6 to 18 Mev, alpha particles in four intervals covering 1.7 to 80 Mev, and electrons, deuterons, tritons,\nand helium-3 nuclei in the intervals 0.3 to 3, 5 to 20, 5.5 to 25, and\n11 to 72 Mev, respectively. Onboard calibration checks were performed\nevery 6 hr. The experiment performed normally from launch to the spacecraft reentry date, May 3, 1969.\n\nF7\n\nLow Energy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer\nJ.A. Van Allen\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThis experiment was designed to measure low-energy electron and\nproton intensities separately inside the magnetosphere and in the interplanetary region. The detector system consisted of a curved plate,\ncylindrical, electrostatic analyzer (LEPEDEA - Low Energy Proton and\nElectron Differential Energy Analyzer) and Bendix continuous channel\nmultiplier (Channeltron) array, and in addition, an Anton 213 GM tube\n\n54\n\ndesigned to survey the intensities of electrons with E > 40 kev in the\nouter magnetosphere. The electrostatic analyzer was capable of measuring\nthe angular distributions and differential energy spectra of proton (25\nev to 47 kev) and electron (33 ev to 57 kev) intensities, separately,\nwithin 15 contiguous energy intervals. The analyzer accumulators were\nread out four times every 20.48 sec. Each accumulation was about 480\nmsec long (spacecraft spin period was initially 2.6 sec). A complete\nscan of the spectrum for four directions in a plane perpendicular to\nthe spacecraft spin axis required 307.2 sec. For each energy interval,\nthe detector response for four approximately 60\xc2\xb0 segments of the angular\ndistribution were telemetered^ The instruments performed normally from\nlaunch until the satellite decayed on May 3, 1969.\n\nF8\n\nCosmic Ray Anisotropy\n\nK.G. McCracken\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n\nThe experiment was designed to study solar particle anisotropy\narid its variation with time. A telescope, consisting of three aligned\ndetectors (A - solid state, B - plastic scintillator, C - Csl scintiilator) and a plastic scintillator anticoincidence shield (D), was\nused to measure protons from 0.8 to 7.0 Mev (counts in A but not in B)\nand from 35 to 110 Mev (coincident counts in B (dE/dx) and C (total E)\nbut not in D). Pulse height analysis yielded six-point spectra within\neach of these two energy intarvals. In addition, a proportional counter\nprovided directional measurements of X rays with E > 2 kev and electrons\nwith E > 70 kev. Counts in each particle counting mode were obtained in\neach of eight sectors in the ecliptic plane. X-ray counts were obtained\nin the solar sector. A complete set of count rates and spectral data was\nobtained every 81.9 sec. The proportional counter and telescope worked\nwell from launch until March 1968 and May 3, 1969 (spacecraft reentry\ndate), respectively.\n\nF9\n\nGSFC Solid-State Telescope\nF.B; McDonald\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThis experiment used a dE/dx vs E telescope with one thin and two\nthick surface barrier solid-state detectors and an anticoincidence\nplastic scintillator counter. The two thick detectors acted together\nas one detector. The telescope axis was perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis; Counts of particles penetrating the thiri detector\nand stopping in a thick detector were accumulated for two 4.48-sec\nintervals every 2.73 min. The relative contributions to the count\nrate of protons and alpha particles with 4.2 S E < 1 \' 1 Mev/nucleon\n9.\nand energy spectral information were determined by 1024-channel pulse\nheight analysis, which was performed simultaneously on the output of\nthe solid-state detectors eight times every 2.73 min. Separation of-,\ncounting rates into two modes\' (proton and alpha particle) , distinguished by the amount of energy deposited in the thin detector, was not\nachieved as planned. Protons stopping in the thin detecfor (and particles penetrating it) were measured by passing the output signal\nthrough an eight-level energy threshold discriminator. The eight corresponding proton energies ran from 1.1 Mev to about 4 Mev. Data from\nany one level were transmitted once every 2.73 min. The anticoincidence\ns\'cintillator failed in March 1968. This resulted in somewhat higher\nbackground count rates, which rendered isotopic (but not charge)"sepa-\n\n55\n\nration more difficult. Except as already noted, the experiment performed well from launch until May 3, 1969 (spacecraft reentry date).\n\nF10\n\nScintiliator Telescope\nF;Bi McDonald\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThis1 experiment used a dE/dx vs E telescope with thin and thick Csl\nscintillators (one each) and an anticoincidence plastic scintillation\ncounter. The telescope axis was parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.\nCounts of .particles penetrating the thin \'Csl- scintillator and stopping\nin the thick Csl scintillator were accumulated for a 4.48-sec interval\ntwice every 2.73 min. The relative contribution to the count rate of\nvarious\'species (electrons with 2.7 < E < 21;5 Mev, nuclei with charge = 1,\n2, atomic mass = 1, 2, 3, 4, and with 18.7 < E < 81.6 Mev/nucleon) and\nenergy spectral .information we\'re determined by 1024-channel pulse height\nanalysis performed simultaneously oh the output of both Csl scintillators\n16 times every 2:73 min. Separation of counting rates into two modes\n(proton and alpha particle) distinguished by the amount of energy deposited in the thin detector was not achieved as planned. Counts of\nelectrons with 0.3 < E \xc2\xa3 0.9 Mev stopping in the.thin scintillator were\nalso obtained once each 2.73. min. Except as noted above, the experiment performed well from launch to May 3, 1967 (spacecraft reentry date).\n\nFll\n\nChicago Solid-State\nJ.A. Simpson\n\nTelescope\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nThe experiment was designed to measure separately the contributions\nof solar nuclei and of galactic nuclei (Z < 14) using a solid-state cosmic-ray telescope designed for energy loss vs range or total energy\nmeasurements. The particle energy range was proportional to Z2/A; for\n. protons: 0.8 to 9.6 Mev, 9.6 to 18.8 Mev, 29.5 to 94.2 Mev, and 94.2 to\n170 Mev and above. The detector viewing angle was_perpendicular to the\nsatellite spin axis. A second, smaller, solid-state telescope mounted\nparallel to the spacecraft spin axis was used to direct electrons in the\nrange 80 to 130 kev and 175 to 390 kev. The electron detector was designed to provide information concerning the shape and intensity of the\nmagnetospheric electon spectra. The detector accumulators for each\nenergy interval were telemetered four times every 20.48 sec. Each accumulation was 4.8 sec long (spacecraft initial spin period was about\n2.6 sec). The output from three 256-channel nuclear particle telescope\npulse height analyzers was obtained for one incident particle every 5.12\nsec and was telemetered along with the detector accumulators. Except\nfor the failure of the electron detector 6 days after launch, the experiment performed normally until the satellite decayed on May 3, 1969.\n\nG3\n\nChanneltron\nR.P. Lin\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nThe instrumentation for this experiment consisted of a parallel\nplate electric-field analyzer and two funnel-shaped channel multipliers.\nThe parallel plate analyzer was used as a discriminatory device. One\n\n56\n\nof the channel multipliers responded to electrons with 2.5 < E < 7.5\nkev, and the other responded to electrons with 7.5 < E < 12.5 kev. The\nacceptance cones for the channel multipliers had full angles of approximately 30\xc2\xb0 with axes of symmetry 60\xc2\xb0 off the spacecraft spin axis.- Due\nto high background count rates, only data of low quality were obtained.\nOn December 2, 1969, the experiment was turned off.\n\nG4\n\nIon Chamber and GM Tubes\nK.A. Anderson\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nThe instrumentation for this experiment consisted of\'a 10.2-cra\nNether type ipriization chamber arid three pairs of.Geiger-Mueller tubes,\nthe members of which were.perpendicular and parallel to the spacecraft\nspin axis. The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons\nand protons with E > 1 and 15 Mev, respectively. The members of one\npair of GM tubes had 45\xc2\xb0 acceptance cones and responded to electronswith E > 80 kev and protons with E > 1.5 Mev. ,The members of another\npair also had 45\xc2\xb0 acceptance cones and measured electrons with E > 20kev (parallel) or 160 kev (perpendicular) arid protons with E > 400 kev.\nThe members of the third pair with 60\xc2\xb0 acceptance cones responded to\nelectrons with E > 40 kev scattered off a gold foil. The axes of these\nacceptance cones were 0\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0 with respect to the spacecraft spin\naxis. Omnidirectiorially, all of the GM tubes responded to electrons\nwith E > 3 Mey and protons with E > 30 Mev. Pulses from the ion chamber\nand counts from each of the GM tubes were accumulated for 9.92 sec and\nread out four times each 40.96 sec. In addition, the time between the\nfirst two ion chamber pulses in an accumulation period was also telemetered. This experiment has performed normally from launch to. the,\npresent (March 1971) except for the ionizatiori chambers, which intermittently stopped.\n.. . . .\n\nG5\n\nSolar Proton Monitor\nC.O.

Three\ndetectors measured the omnidirectional fluxes of protons and alpha\nparticles with energy per nucleon values with E > 10, 30, and 60 Mev.\nAlpha particle contributions to the total count rates were generally.\nless than 10%. The 10-Mev channel was sampled for two 19.2-sec intervals every 163.8 sec, and the 30- and 60-Mev channels for one 19.2-sec\ninterval every 163.8 sec. Resultant hourly averaged fluxes are published in Solar-Geophysical Data (NOAA, Boulder) on a rapid basis, the\nfourth detector had a 60\xc2\xb0 full look angle normal to the spacecraft spin\naxis. Each of two discrimination levels was sampled for two 19.2-sec\nintervals every 163.8 sec. Fluxes of 1- to 10-Mev protons were measured\nin the lower discrimination state, and fluxes of particles depositing\nmore than 3.6 Mev were measured in the upper discrimination state. All\ndetectors have functioned normally from launch to the present (April 1971) .\n\n57\n\nG6\n\nLow Energy Solid-state Telescope\nW.L.

During\neach 2.73-min interval, 9.82-sec accumulations were obtained in each\nof 16 distinct counting modes. These modes involved protons in five\nenergy intervals covering 0.6 to 18 Mev, alpha particles in four intervals covering 1.7 to 80 Mev, and electrons, deuterons, tritons, and\nhelium-3 nuclei in the intervals 0.3 to 3, 5 to 20, 5.5 to 25, and 11\nto 72 Mev, respectively. Onboard calibration checks were performed\nevery 6 hr. The experiment performed normally until January 30, 1970,\nwhen a GSFC power supply failure limited useful data gathered to low\nenergy protons, electrons, and alphas. Information on these particles\nis not available after that- date. The instrument is still about 30%\noperational (April 1971).\n\nG7\n\nLow Energy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer\nJ.A. Van Allen\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThis experiment, which was similar to the University of Iowa experiment on IMP F, was designed to separately measure low-energy electron and proton intensities inside the magnetosphere and in the interplanetary region. The detector system consisted of a curved plate,\ncylindrical, electrostatic analyzer (LEPEDEA detector) and Bendix continuous channel multiplier (Channeltron) array, and an Anton 213 GM\ntube designed to survey the intensities of electrons with E > 40 kev\nin the outer magnetosphere. The electrostatic analyzer was capable of\nmeasuring the angular distributions and differential energy spectra of\nproton and electron intensities, separately, within 15 contiguous energy\nintervals over the energy ranges 25 ev to 47 kev and 33 ev to 57 kev.\nThe analyzer accumulators were read out four times every 20.48 sec.\nEach accumulation was about 480 msec long (spacecraft spin period was\ninitially 2.6 sec). A complete scan of the spectrum for four directions\nin a plane perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis required 307.2 sec.\nFor each energy interval, the detector response for four approximately\n60\xc2\xb0 segments of the angular distribution was telemetered. The instruments were performing normally as of March 1971.\n\nG8\n\nLow Energy Proton Differential Energy Analyzer\nL.A. Frank\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThis experiment was designed to observe positive ion intensities\nin the solar wind, within the magnetosheath, and in the geomagnetic\ntail using a modified low energy proton and electron differential\nenergy analyzer (LEPEDEA detector). The detector, which was composed\nof curved plate electrostatic analyzers and continuous channel multipliers (channeltrons), was designed to measure differential energy\nspectra and angular distributions of low energy positive ions over the\nenergy range 90 ev to 12 kev. The detector was an analog device and,\ntherefore, was read continuously during the flight. Energy measurements\nwere obtained within 32 individual energy intervals over the proposed\nrange and at 16 sun-referenced azimuthal directions perpendicular to\n\n58\n\nthe spacecraft spin axis for each energy interval. The experiment performed normally for about two and one half months from launch when the\nexperiment power supply failed.\n\nG9\n\nCosmic Ray Anisotropy\nK.G. McCracken\n\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas\n\nThis experiment was designed to study solar particle anisotropy\nand its variations with time. A telescope, consisting of three\naligned detectors (A - solid state, B - plastic scintillator, C - Csl\nscintillator) and a plastic scintillator anticoincidence shield (D),\nwas used to measure protons from 0.8 to 7.0 Mev (counts in A but not\nin B) and from 35 to 110 Mev (coincident counts in B CdE/dx) and C\n(total E) but not in D). Pulse height analysis yielded six-point\nspectra within each of these two energy intervals. In addition, a\nproportional counter provided directional measurements of X rays\nwith E > 2 kev and electrons with E > 70 kev. Counts in each particle counting mode were obtained in each of eight sectors in the\necliptic plane. X-ray counts were obtained in the solar sector.\nA complete set of count rates and spectral data was obtained every\n81.9 sec. The experiment was functioning normally as of March 1971.\n\nG10\n\nSolid-State Detectors\nF.B. McDonald\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThis experiment used a dE/dx vs E telescope with one thin and two\nthick surface barrier solid-state detectors and an anticoincidence\nplastic scintillator counter. The two thick detectors acted together\nas one detector. The telescope axis was perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. Counts of particles penetrating the thin detector\nand stopping in a thick detector were accumulated for a 4.48-sec interval once each 2.73 min for each of two counting modes. (Counting\nmodes are defined with respect to the energy deposited in the thin\ndE/dx detector. Good separation of protons and alpha particles was\nachieved by this mode distinction.) The relative contribution of\neach count rate of protons and alpha particles with 4.2 < E < 19.1\nMev/nucleon and energy spectral information were determined by\n1024-channel pulse height analysis performed simultaneously on the\noutput of the solid-state detectors four times every 2.73 min for\neach of the two threshold modes. Protons stopping in the thin detector (and particles penetrating it) were measured by passing the\noutput signal through an eight-level energy threshold discriminator.\nThe eight corresponding proton energies ran from 0.6 Mev to about\n4 Mev. Data from any one level were transmitted once every 2.73 min.\nThere were also two solid-state detectors that looked along the\nspacecraft spin axis and that were identical except for differing\ncovering foil thicknesses. Both responded to electrons in the 80to 200-kev range. One responded to protons with 83 kev < E < 2 Mev\nand the other to protons with 200 kev < E < 2 Mev. Spectral information\nwas gathered by subjecting the output signals from each detector to\neight-level energy threshold discrimination. \xe2\x80\xa2 Data from each of the\neight levels and each of the two detectors were transmitted once each\n5.46 min. Except for a 2-week period in March 1970 when the telescope\ndata were noisy, all the detectors have functioned normally from launch\nto the present (March 1971).\n\n59\n\nGil\n\nSciiitillator Telescope ;\nF.B. McDonald\n\nNASA/Goddard .Space Flight Center\n\nThis experiment used a dE/dx vs E telescope with thin and thick Csl\nscintillators (one each) and an anticoincidence plastic scintillation\ncounter. The telescope axis was parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.\nCounts of particles penetrating the thin Csl scintillator and stopping\nin the thick Csl scintillator were accumulated for two 4.48-sec intervals each 2.73 min. The relative contribution to the count rate of\nvarious species (electrons with 2.7 \xc2\xa3 E < 21.5 Mev, nuclei with\ncharge * 1 and 2, atomic mass = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and with 18;7 < E < 81.6\nMev/nucleon) and energy spectral information were determined by 1024channel pulse height analysis performed simultaneously on the output\nof both Csl scintillators 16 times every 2.73 min. In addition, counts\nof electrons with 0.3 < E < 0.9 Mev stopping in the thin scintillator\nwere also obtained once each 2.73 min. The experiment was functioning\nnormally as of March 1971.\n\nG12\n\nSolid-State Telescope\nJ.A. Simpson\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nThis experiment was designed to measure separately the contributions of solar nuclei and of galactic nuclei (Z \xc2\xa3 14) using a combination solid-state and Cerenkov counter cosmic-ray telescope detector. The detector was designed for energy loss vs range or total\nenergy measurements for protons (differential measurements between\n0.8 to 119 Mev and an integral measurement between 119 Mev and 1 Bev).\nSimilar differential energy measurements of HE and higher Z nuclei\nwere made between 3 Mev/riucleon and 1 Bev/nucleon. The detector was\noriented perpendicular to the satellite spin axis. The detector\naccumulators were telemetered four times every 20.48 sec. Each accumulation was 4.8 sec long (spacecraft initial spin period was about\n2.2 sec). The output from the three 256-channel pulse height analyzers\nwas obtained for one incident particle every 5.12 sec and was telemetered\nalong with the detector accumulators. The experiment was functioning\nnormally as of March 1971.\n\n16\n\nSolid-State and GM Detectors\n\nK.A. Anderson\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley\n\nThis experiment, which was designed to study the acceleration of\nelectrons at the sun and their ejection into interplanetary space, consisted of four detectors. Two of these were GM tubes with viewing\ndirections anti-parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Data from each\nGM tube were accumulated for one spin period and were read out once every\n20.48 sec. One tube responded to electrons with E > 15 kev that were\nbackscattered off a gold foil. The other GM tube directly observed\nelectrons and protons with E > 15 and 150 kev, respectively. The third\ndetector was a telescope consisting of three semiconductors that had a\nviewing direction of 165\xc2\xb0 with respect to the spacecraft spin axis.\nThis detector responded to electrons and protons in the energy intervals\n20 to 400 kev and 0.2 to 2 Mev, respectively. Data from this detector\nwere accumulated for one spin period and were read out once each 20.48\n\n60\n\nsec. The last detector consisted of two semiconductors with a viewing\ndirection perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. This detector responded to electrons with 40 < E < 200 kev that were backscattered off\na gold foil. Data from each of 16 sectors were accumulated for 1/16 of\na spin period and telemetered once each 20.48 sec. Initial experiment\nperformance was normal.\n\n17\n\nSolar Proton Monitor\nC.O. Bostiroin\n\nJohns Hopkins University/Applied\nPhysics Laboratory\n\nThe solar proton monitoring .experiment consisted of five separate\ndetectors, each using one or more solid-state detector elements. Three\ndetectors, each with a 2ir ster field-of view and a 20.48-sec accumulation\ntime, measured protons with E > 10, 30, and 60 Mev. Resultant hourly\naveraged fluxes will be published on a rapid basis in Solar-Geophysical\nData. The fourth detector measured directional fluxes of protons in\nthree energy intervals between 0.21 Mev and 7.5 Mev. The fifth detector measured directional fluxes of electrons with E > 10 kev. For the\nlast two detectors, counts were obtained in 45\xc2\xb0 sectors as the spacecraft spun. Onboard calibration capability for the first four detectors\nwas included. Initial experiment performance was normal.\n\n18\n\nCrystal Scihtillator\nT.L. Cline\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThis experiment was designed to study galactic and solar electrons\nand positrons in the kinetic energy range 50 kev to 2 Mev. Information\non protons with 0.5^ E < 4.0 Mev was also obtained. A collimated >Stilbene crystal scintlllator looking perpendicular to the spacecraft spin\naxis was the principal detector. A similar, fully shielded crystal\nserved to determine the contribution to the principal detector count\nrate of eiectrpns and protons generated within the principal detector\nby gamma rays and neutrons,,respectively. A fully shielded Csl crystal\nserved as a gamma-ray spectrometer and was used in coincidence with the\nprincipal .detector to distinguish.electrons from positrons. Count rates\nfrom each detector obtained in eight angular sectors per revolution were\ntelemetered. In addition, the amplitude and shape of the pulse generated- in the principal detector by the first stopping particle in each\nappropriate telemetry frame were studied. Pulse amplitude and shape\nyielded energy (10% resolution) and particle species information, initial\nexperiment performance was normal.\n\n19\n\nLow Energy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer\nL.A. Frank\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThis experiment was designed to conduct comprehensive observations\nof the differential energy spectra; the angular distribution, and spatial distributions and temporal variations of electrons and protons\nover the geocentric radial distance range 1.03 to 30 RE. Two arrays of\ncurved-plate cylindrical electrostatic analyzers and continuous channel\nmultipliers were used for this purpose. One analyzer, the LEPEDEA (Low\n\n61\n\nEnergy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer), was included\nto measure protons and electrons separately in the energy range 24 ev\nto 50 key"(16 energy intervals). The other analyzer LEPDEA (Low Energy Proton Differential Energy Analyzer) was included to measure the\nenergy spectra and angular distributions of protons in the energy range\n1.7 ev to 550 ev (eight energy intervals): An EON type 213 GM counter,\nwhose collimated field of view of 15\xc2\xb0 half angle was oriented approximately parallel to that of the LEPEDEA, was used to measure the intensity of electrons with E > 45 kev and protons with E > 500 kev and to\nprovide background measurements for the LEPEDEA. Initial experiment\nperformance was normal.\n\n110\n\nSolid-State and Scintillator Telescopes\nF.B. McDonald\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe GSFC cbsmic-ray experiment was designed to measure energy\nspectra, composition, and angular distributions of solar and galactic\nelectrons, protons, and heavier nuclei up to Z = 30. Three distinct\ndetector systems were used. The first system consisted of four\nessentially identical solid-state telescopes. Two were perpendicular and\ntwo were\'parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Because the telescopes\ndiffered in their absorbing thickness, some discrimination between\nelectrons and protons was possible. Each detector responded to particles\nbetween 50 kev arid 2 Mev. A seven-level integral analyzer was included\nfor spectral information. The second detector system was a solid-state\ndE/dx vs E telescope that looked perpendicular to the spin axis. This\ntelescope measured Z = 1 to 16 nuclei with 4 S E < 20 Mev/nucleon.\nCounts of particles in the 0.5 to 4 Mev/nucleon range, with no charge\nresolution, were obtained as counts in the dE/dx, but not in the E\nsensor. The third detector system was a\'three-element Csl scintillator\ntelescope whose axis made an angle of 39\xc2\xb0 with respect to the spin axis.\nThe instrument responded to electrons with 2 < E < 12 Mev and to Z = 1\nto 30 nuclei in the energy range 20 to 500 Mev/nucleon. For particles\nbelow 80 Mev this instrument acted as a dE/dx detector. Above 80 Mev,\nit acted as a bidirectional triple dE/dx detector. By use of a combination of pulse height analysis and gain switching,\'the output of\neach sensor of the second and third detector systems was sorted into one\n6f iOOO-and 1200 energy channels, respectively. Flux directionality\ninformation was obtained by dividing certain portions of the data from\neach detector into\'eight angular sectors. Initial experiment performance\nwas normal.\n\nIll\n\nSolid-State Telescopes\nJ.A. Simpson\n\nUniversity of Chicago\n\nThis experiment was designed to measure the energy spectra of\nnuclei over a wide dynamic range of fluxes Cat least 100,000). Emphasis has been placed on high charge resolution extending from Z = 1\nto Z =30, and high isotopic resolution for H, He, and Li. The experiment was also designed to measure electrons with E > 2 Mev. The instrumentation included two particle telescopes (a composition telescope\nand a low energy telescope)-protected by anticoincidence shields, an\nelectron current detector, and a fission cell. The composition telescope was composed of four solid-state\'detectors and a Cerenkov counter,\nand the low energy telescope was composed of five solid-state and two\n\n62\n\nscintillation detectors. Both telescopes were to be calibrated periodically in flight by programmed- pulse generators. The output of sensors Dl, D4, and the Cerenkov counter of the composition telescope were\npulse height analyzed by three 512-channel pulse height analyzers, and\nthe output of D2 was analyzed by a 1024-ctiannel pulse height analyzer.\nUse of the various count rate modes provided a differential energy\nspectrum (three \'intervals) of nuclei up to about Z = 30 in the energy\nrange from 0.5 to 1200 Mev/nucleon, The Cerenkov counter allowed\nmeasurement of nuclei from 1.2 to about 2 Bev/nucleon before saturating.\nSimilarly, the outputs of sensors Dl, D2, and D5 of the low energy\ntelescope were pulse height analyzed using two 256-chanhel analyzers.\nSensors Dl and D5 shared one\'analyzer; i.e., when an event had sufficient energy to trigger D5, then the analyzer was automatically switched\nfrom Dl to D5.. The differential energy spectrum (two intervals) of\nnuclei up to about Z = 30 was obtained from about 0.5 to about 800 Mev/\nnucleon. The electron current detector (ECD) and the fission cell carried\nout measurements in the earth\'s radiation belts. The ECD\'detected extremely high intensities (> 1,000,000 particles/cm .sq-sec) of electrons\nwith E > 2 Mev by measuring the current generated in a solid-state detector by the ipnization loss of large numbers of electrons. TKe fission\ncell was designed to detect proton fluxes (E > 50 Mev) by sandwiching a\nthin foil of Th232 between two\' solid-state detectors which responded\nonly to large pulses left by slow moving fragments from proton induced\nfission of the thorium. The composition telescope failed within a day\nafter launch, but the performance of the other experiment systems has\nbeen normal.\n\'\n\' \'\n\nH6\n\nCrystal Scintillator\n\nT.L. Cline\n\nNASA/Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nThis experiment is designed to study galactic and solar electrons\nand positrons in the kinetic- energy range 50 kev to 2 Mev.\nInformation\non protons between 0.5 and 4.0 Mev will also be obtained. A colllmated\nStilbene crystal scintillator looking perpendicular to the spacecraft\nspin axis is the principal detector. A-similar, fully shielded crystal\nwill serve to -determine the contribution to the principal detector count\nrate of electrons and protons generated within the principal detector by\ngamma rays and neutrons, respectively. A fully shielded Csl crystal\nwill serve as a\' gamma-ray spectrometer and will be used in coincidence\nwith the principal\'detector to distinguish electrons from .positrons.\nCount rates from"each detector obtained in eight angular sectors per\nrevolution will be telemetered. In addition, the-amplitude and shape\nof the pulse generated in the principal detector by the\'first stopping\nparticle in each appropriate telemetry frame will be studied. Pulse\namplitude and shape will yield energy (10% resolution) and particle\nspecies information.\n\nH7\n\nLow Energy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer\nL.A. Frank\n\nUniversity of Iowa\n\nThis experiment is designed to measure the energy spectra of low\nenergy electrons arid protons in" the geocentric range 30 to 40 RE in\norder to further understand geomagnetic storms, aurora, tail and\nneutral sheet, and other magnetospheric phenomena, the detector is\na dual-channel curved plate electrostatic analyzer (LEPEDEA- Low\n\n63\n\nEnergy Proton and Electron Differential Energy Analyzer) with 16 energy\nintervals between 5 ev and 50 kev. It has an angular field of view\nof 9\xc2\xb0 x 25\xc2\xb0. The detector may be operated in one of two modes, (1)\none providing good angular resolution (16 directions for each particle\nenergy band) once each 272 sec and (2) one providing good temporal\nresolution in which the entire energy range in four directions is\nmeasured every 68 sec.\n\nH8\n\nUniversity of Maryland Solid-State Detectors\nG.

The experiment is to\nmeasure particles with energies from 0.1 to 2 Mev/charge in 12 bands\nand to uniquely identify positrons, electrons, and nuclei with Z between 1 and 8 (no charge resolution for Z greater than 8). Two 1000channel pulse height analyzers are included in the experiment, one for\neach detector system.\n\nH9\n\nSolid-State and GM Detectors\nS.M.

For particles below 80 Mev this instrument acts as a dE/dx detector. Above 80 Mev, it acts as a bidirectional\ntriple dE/dx detector. Flux directionability information will be obtained by dividing certain portions of the data from each detector system\ninto eight angular sectors.\n\nHll\n\nChicago Solid-State Telescopes\nJ.A.

A study of simultaneous magnetic field and energetic particle\nrecptds from the IMP 1 satellite on the dark side of the earth has\nshown several distinct correlations that can be understood as diamaghetic effects of charged particle populations: Depression of the\nmagnetic field in the closed magnetic field line configuration of\nthe particle cusp region is observed on most orbits.. A small but\nsignificant portion of this effect can,be attributed to the diamagnetic\neffects of electrons >45 kev. In the geomagnetic tail region, large\ndepressions of the magnetic field having radial extent ~10 Rg are\nobserved when the satellite approaches the neutral sheet to within\n~5 Rg. Energetic electron fluxes appear throughout this volume and\nshow no strong preference to occur immediately .adjacent to the neutral\nsheet. In this region, less than 1% of the diamagnetic effect is due\nto electrons >45 kev. Finally, there are examples of intense, energetic\nelectron fluxes closely associated with reduction of the magnetic field\nmagnitude. In one case, an electron flux of 3 x iO6 cm 2 sec 1 >45 kev\nwas associated with a field change.from 20 y to 8 Y-\n\nAl-02\n\nBehannon, K.W., and N.F. Ness, "Magnetic Storms in the Earth\'s\nMagnetic Tail." J. Geophys. Res.. 71, 2327-2351, 1966.\nDetailed measurements of the earth\'s magnetic field at distances\nbetween 7 and 31.4 Rg were obtained by the IMP 1 satellite between\nNov. 27, 1963, and May 30, 1964. The interaction of the solar wind\nwith the geomagnetic field compresses it on the sunlit hemisphere but\nextends the field to form a magnetic tail in the antisolar direction\nwith a median magnitude of 16 gammas. From March 15 to June 3, 1964,\nthe satellite was imbedded well within the magnetic tail and for 19+\norbits (29-48) it measured principally the temporal variation and\nspatial structure of this tail field. The experimental data reveal\nthe development of a magnetically neutral sheet in the tail separating\nfields of opposite direction that are aligned parallel to the earthsun line. A total of five magnetic storms were observed terrestrially\nthat are correlated with satellite data and .discussed in this paper.\nThree storms of an M-region sequence, presumed to be associated with\nthe sector structure within the corotating interplanetary medium are\npresented and discussed in detail, as well as two other magnetic storms.\nBoth positive and negative correlations with\'worldwide H-component\nterrestrial data.are observed. The former is interpreted to be due to\nlarge-scale compression of the entire magnetosphere arid tail. Anticorrelation of the H component with the tail field magnitude is shown\nto be due to an increased number of lines of force being carried into\nthe tail by the enhanced solar plasma flow. This occurs simultaneously\nwith the main phase decrease and thus supports geomagnetic storm thepries\ninvoking such a tail field mechanism. Positive correlations of an increased tail field magnitude with the planetary magnetic index Kp are\nalso obtained.\n\n71\n\nAl-03\n\nFairfield, D.H., "Average and Unusual Locations of the Earth\'s\nMagnetopause and Bow Shock," NASA-GSFC, X-692-70-452, Dec. 1970.\n(Accepted for publication in J. Geophys. Res.)\nA best fit ellipse and hyperbola have been calculated to represent several hundred magnetopause and bow shock positions observed\nby six IMP spacecraft. Average geocentric distances to the magnetopause and bow shock near the ecliptic plane are 11.0 RE and 14.6 RE\nin the sunward direction, 15.1 RE and 22.8 RE in the dawn meridian\nand 15.8 and 27.6 RE in the dusk meridian. The bow shock hyperbola\nis oriented in a direction consistent with that expected considering\naberration of a radial solar wind. Observed magnetopause crossings\nagree well with theoretical predictions in the noon meridian plane ~\nbut fall outside the theoretical boundaries ip the dawn-dusk meridian\nplanes. IMP 4 plasma data are used to demonstrate that the solar\nwind momentum flux is the prime factor controlling the qrbit-to-orbit\nchanges in the boundary positions. Data suggest that the interplanetary field orientation also affects the- distance to the \'magnetopause\nboundary with more earthward crossings"corresponding to southward\nfields. Six unusual bow shock locations up to 2? RE beyond the average\nposition are found to be due to an enhanced standoff distance associated with a low Alfven Mach number.\' The possibility is raised that\nthe solar wind may have become sub-Alfvenic on July 31, 1967.\n\nAl-04 Fairfield, D.H. , "Average Magnetip Field Configuration of phe\nOuter Magnetosphere," J. Geophys. Res.. _73, 7329-7338, 1968.\nOver 1500 hours of data from the satellites IMP 1, 2, and 3\nhave been used to study the configuration of the magnetic field in\nthe outer magnetosphere between 5 and 18 Re. Hourly average field\nvectors were projected in-the solar magnetic equatorial plane and in\n24 meridian sections corresponding to each, -hour of local time. The\npiots show the sweeping back of\'the field toward the tail and the\ndawn and dusk transition from compressed dayside field lines to extended nightside field lines. Constant B contours in the equatorial\nplane were constructed, and flux conservation was used to establish a\nquantitative relationship between the equatorial crossing point of an\nouter magnetosphere field line and the. latitude of its earth intersection. A contour diagram in the equatorial plane designating the\nlatitude of field line origin permits the mapping\'of low-altitude\nphenomena to the equatorial plane \'and vice versa. Auroral oval field\nlines are found to come from the region of the\' magnetopause in the\ndaylight hemisphere but from well within the magnetosphere. in the\nnight hemisphere. The outermost closed field line is found to come\nfrom approximately 78\xc2\xb0 throughout the dayside hemisphere.\n\nAl-05\n\nFairfield, D.H., "Ordered Magnetic Field of the Magnetosheath,\nJ. Geophys.

A one-to-one correspondence of discontinuities at the\ntwo satellites persists even when one of the satellites is in the magnetosheath fields and their relation to simultaneously measured inter-\n\n72\n\nplanetary fields shows that as magnetosheath fields are convected\naround the magnetopause by the solar plasma they undergo distortion\nfrom their interplanetary directions until they are aligned tangent to\nthe magnetopause.

Physical properties\nand dynamics of the geomagnetic tail are defined, and a figure is included to depict both the-geometry of the tail and the earth\'s bow\nshock in cislunar space, as well as the orbits of the satellites used\nin the experiments. Among the data reported are: (1) The plasma\nsheet surrounding the neutral sheet appears to be thicker in the center\nof the tail, flaring\'to approximately twice that near the dusk and dawn\nmagnetopause boundaries. (2) The tail is still well-defined out to\nradial distances of 80 RE although at distances of 500 and 1000 RE it\nappears to have broken up into separate filaments.

The interplanetary magnetic field was found\nto fluctuate very rapidly and reach anomalously large values when the\nsatellite was approximately eclipsed by the moon in\'December 1963.\nLater data on the interplanetary field in February 1964 suggest that a\ndetached lunar shock wave analogous to that observed by Imp 1 associated\n\n73\n\nwith the earth may not be a permanent feature of the lunar environment.\nThe approximate length of the wake region behind the moon is 150 lunar\nradii; at this distance the diameter of the region is about 70 lunar\nradii. Related studies on 29.5-day periodicities in Kp are reviewed.\nThe solar wind interaction with the geomagnetic field extends the\nmagnetosphere far behind the earth. Hence lunar synodic periodicities\nin Kp may reflect the interaction of the moon with the earth\'s magnetic\ntail rather than the moon\'s wake with the earth.\n\nAl-09\n\nNess, N.F., C.S.

The strength of the interplanetary magnetic field is\nfound to vary between 4 and 7y, with extreme values as low as 1, and\nas high as 10y. The magnitude, however, is extremely stable over\ntimes of hours, although changes of direction are significant. The\naverage direction of the interplanetary magnetic field is slightly below the plane of the ecliptic and approximately along the streaming\nangle predicted for a steady-state solar wind. A significant feature\nof the magnetic field measurements is said to be the discovery of\nfields pointed diametrically opposite the streaming angle, indicating\nthe filamentary structure of the interplanetary field. The complex\ninteraction of the solar wind and the geomagnetic field shows a\nvariety of magnetic field fluctuations and transition characteristics.\nIt is noted that the detection of the collisionless magnetohydrodynamlc\nshock wave at 13.4 Rg at the stagnation point associated with superAlfvenic flow of solar plasma is one of the major results of this\nexperiment.\n\nAl-10\n\nNess, N.F. , and J.M. Wilcox, "Extension of the Photospheric Magnetic Field into Interplanetary Space," Astrophys. J., 143, 2331, 1966.\nObservations of the nearby interplanetary magnetic field by the\nmagnetometer experiment on the artificial Earth satellite IMP-1 have\nbeen compared with observations of the photospheric magnetic field\nobtained with the solar magnetograph at the Mt. Wilson Observatory.\nA good correlation has been found between the large scale pattern of\nthe direction (into or out of the sun) of the photospheric field and\nthe pattern of the direction (toward or away from the sun) of the\nnearby interplanetary field. This substantiates the theoretical model\nof the transport of solar magnetic fields into interplanetary space by\nthe magnetohydrodynamic expansion of the solar corona.\n\nAl-11\n\nNess, N.F., and J.M.

The sector property\n\n74\n\nremains a prominent feature of the observations with the average field\ndirection at the Archimedes spiral angle. The sector pattern has a\n27-day recurrence period from 1962 to 1964, and during the year 1964\nthe pattern appears to be quasi-stable. In 1965 the recurrence period\nis about 28 days, and the evolution of the pattern is more rapid, with\nnew sectors appearing and expanding.\n\nAl-12 Ness, N.F., and J.M.

Wilson Observatory are\npresented. Results indicate that during three solar rotations near\nthe minimum of the solar cycle, some of the magnetic field lines passing through the photosphere near the center of the visible disk tended\nto be dragged out by the solar wind plasma to become part of the nearby interplanetary magnetic field. The best correlation was obtained\nwhen the photospheric field was in the same direction throughout an\narea corresponding to at least two or three days rotation. These\nconclusions are consistent with a suggested model in which the sense\nof the interplanetary magnetic field filaments is related to the sense\nof photospheric magnetic field regions.\n\nAl-13 Ness, N.F., and D.J.

The interplanetary field is directed predominantly\naway from the sun for 2/7 of a rotation, then toward the sun for 2/7\nof a rotation, then away from the sun for 2/7 of a rotation, and\nfinally toward the sun for 1/7 of a rotation. The interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and the solar wind velocity, density, and flux\nare discussed with regard to this sector structure. As the structure\nrotates past the earth once every 27 days it influences geomagnetic\nactivity and cosmic-ray density. A recurring stream of protons \'of a\nfew Mev energy is almost entirely contained within one sector. The\nsolar source of the recurring geomagnetic storm of Dec. 2, 1963, is\nassociated with a ghost unipolar magnetic region in the solar photosphere.\n\nAl-17\n\n:\n\nWilcox, J.M. , and N.F.

The interplanetary sector structure was\nmost prominent on the sun in latitudes between 10\xc2\xb0N and 20\xc2\xb0N, although\nthe average heliographic latitude of the satellite was 3-l/2\xc2\xb0S. A\nsuperposed-epoch analysis of the calcium plage structure obtained from\n.. \xe2\x80\xa2- the Fraunhofer Institute daily maps of the sun is used to discuss the \'\nrelation between the structure of the plages and the interplanetary\nsector structure. A possible explanation for the observations is\ndiscussed in terms of a north-south asymmetry in the flow of the solar\nwind. It is suggested that these observations favor the "equinoctial"\nhypothesis as compared with the "axial" hypothesis for the explanation\nof the semiannual maxima in geomagnetic activity.\n\nAl-18\n\nWilcox, J.M., K.H.

Res., 72, 19-26, 1967.\nObservations by the IMP 1 satellite of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield and plasma have been compared with the 3-hr geomagnetic activity\nindex Kp. The average Kp is approximately a_linear function of the\ninterplanetary field magnitude B in gammas (Kp = (0.33 \xc2\xb1 0.02) B \xc2\xb1\'0.2).\nIt appears significant that this relation between Kp and field magni^\ntude passes through the origin, whereas the linear relation between Kp\nand solar wind velocity does not. The average Kp is approximately a\nlinear function of solar wind velocity, but with perhaps a slightly\ndifferent slope and zero intercept from the similar relation observed\nby Snyder, Neugebauer, and Rao with Mariner 2. Little correlation is\nobserved between Kp and solar wind density, but this result is consistent with the interplanetary sector pattern discussed by Wilcox and\nNess. Cross-correlation as a function of time lag of Kp and interplanetary field (or solar wind velocity) yields a positive peak correlation at\nzero lag, suggesting that a large part of the response of the magnetosphere to solar wind excitation.occurs within the 3-hr Kp period.\n\n76\n\nAl-19\n\nWilliams, D.J., and N.F.

(IAU Symposium\'No. 35, Proceedings held in Budapest, Hungary, Sept; 4-8, 1967.)\nThe relation of solar active regions to the large-scale sector\nstructure of the interplanetary field is discussed. In the winter of\n1963-64 (observed by the satellite IMP-1) the plage density was greatest\nin the leading portion of the sectors and lesser in the trailing portion of the sectors. The boundaries of the sectors (places at wfi\n\n79\n\nthe direction of the interplanetary magnetic field changed from toward\nthe Sun to away from the Sun, or vice versa) were remarkably free of\nplages. The very fact that since the first observations in 1962 the\naverage interplanetary field has almost always had the property of\nbeing either toward the Sun or away from the Sun (along the Archimedean\nspiral angle) continuously for several days must be considered in the\ndiscussion of large-scale evolution of active regions. Using the observed interplanetary magnetic field at 1 AU and a set of reasonable\nassumptions the magnetic configuration in the ecliptic from 0.4 to 1.2 AU\nhas been reconstructed. In at least one case a pattern emerges which\nappears to be related to the evolution of an active region from an\nearly stage in which the magnetic lines closely couple the preceding\nand following halves of the region to a later stage in which the two\nhalves of the region are more widely separated.\n\n,\n\nPrincipal Investigator Group/Other Publications\n\nAl-28\n\nBridge, H.S., G.P.

Second order results indicate a rich fine scale filamentary\nstructure of the interplanetary medium in which individual flux tubes\nappear to be directly connected to the sun. From these detailed studies and long term observations, it is now possible to view the interplanetary medium as being.structured on three characteristic time\nscales: microstructuire, less than one hour; mesostructure, 1 to 100\nhours; and macrostructure, greater than 100 hours.\n\nAl-33\n\nNess, N.F., Magnetosphere and Its Boundary Layer, NASA, SP-71,\n31-40, 1965.\n(Proceedings of the 2nd Symposium on Protection\nAgainst Radiation Hazards in Space, Gatlinburg, Tenn., Oct. 1964.)\nThe distortion of the earth\'s magnetic field and the resultant\nboundary layer region between the magnetosphere and the undisturbed\ninterplanetary medium were measured by the IMP-1 satellite for energetic\nparticles, low energy plasmas, and magnetic fields.

Pai,\nAcademic Press, New York, New York.)\nThe advent of the satellite and space probe era 8 years ago introduced into the realm of extra-terrestrial physics the possibility of\ndirectly measuring the properties of interplanetary space and the\ndistant geomagnetic field. Since 1957 ah impressive sequence of such\nin situ experiments has led not only to renewed investigations of well\nknown solar-terrestrial physical problems but also initiated studies\ninvestigating completely new phenomenon not previously anticipated.\nThese are represented by the Van Allen radiation belt and the phenomenon\nof the solar wind and its effect upon the terrestrial magnetic field.\nSubsequent to early suggestions by Biermann in 1951 for a continuous and substantial solar corpuscular flux to explain the observed\ncharacteristics of Type I comet tails, Parker in the late 1950\'s\ndeveloped the theory of the "solar wind" or hydrodynamic expansion of\nthe solar corona interplanetary space. Direct measurements by satellites have confirmed the existence of the solar wind and the continual\nconfinement of the geomagnetic field as well as the development of\nan extended magnetic tail of the earth. On the sunlit, side of the\nearth, the regular geomagnetic field terminates at approximately 85,000\nkilometers while on the nightside of the earth the terrestrial field\nis observed to trail out in a high distorted fashion at least halfway\nto the distance to the moon. Standing off from the regular geomagnetic\nfield a boundary has been, observed between a turbulent boundary layer\nand the undisturbed interplanetary medium which is tentatively identified as a collisionless magnetohydrodynamic shock wave. The use of a\ncontinuum fluid dynamic analogy applied to the solar wind permits an\nestimate of the standoff distance for a spherical object which approximates the confined geomagnetic field. Direct comparison with observations is reasonably good and suggests that the phenomenon investigated\nis indeed a collisionless shock.

Within the 20-sec time resolution available, it is concluded that no unique local correlation exists between the electron\npulses and the magnetic field intensity. However, the general ambient\nfield tends to be more disturbed and to be directed more nearly along\nthe sun-earth line during periods when pulses are present than otherwise. Three distinct types of electron events are observed. The first\ntype of event is found in the magnetosheath and may be due to electrons\nconvected with the solar plasma. The second type is clearly associated\nwith multiple crossings of the bow shock. The third type of event\napparently occurs beyond the bow shock and is associated with magnetic\nfield fluctuations with periods >10 .sec. The observations require that\nthe excess particle energy density during pulses be somewhat less than\nthat of the ambient magnetic field. It is thus concluded that the\nenergy spectra of electrons observed in the magnetosheath and beyond\nare different from those observed in the earth\'s magnetic tail.

The dependence of\nneutral sheet electron fluxes upon the radial distance from the magnetic dipple and upon geomagnetic field disturbances is investigated.\nThe present evidence for neutral sheet electrons indicates either (a)\nthat the sheet is well-connected to a region of electron acceleration\nin the magnetosphere and the sheet behaves like a corridor or channel\nfor electron escape, or alternatively, (b) that the electrons are\naccelerated in the neutral sheet:\n\nAl-54\n\nNishida, A., "Coherence of Geomagnetic DP 2 Fluctuations with\nInterplanetary Magnetic Variation," J.

In addition\nto earlier interpretations relating polar substorms to tail reconnection, certain phenomena preceding substorms may be associated with\ndayside reconnection. The boundaries of the reconnection model are\ncomplex and, in particular, the model predicts a diffuse boundary at\nhigh latitudes at times of dayside reconnection. The observed variability of the interplanetary field leads to the prediction that the\ntail has several branches which represent obstacles in the magnetosheath, these obstacles moving more slowly than the surrounding plasma.\nSome boundaries may be detected by the standard magnetic and plasma\nobservations and some may be associated with spikes of energetic particles even beyond the shock.

(Ph.D. Thesis.)\nA physical model that is consistent with many of the properties\nobserved in the corona and in interplanetary space has been\'developed.\nThe model allows the large-scale magnetic field configuration above\nthe photosphere to be computed from photospheric magnetic field observations utilizing a Green\'s function solution to Maxwell\'s equations.\nSources for the\' magnetic field are related to the observed photospheric\nfield and to the field computed at a "source" surface about 0.6 solar\nradii above the photosphere. The model is able to explain the shape\nof rays and streamers in the inner corona.\nThe model allows a computation of the magnetic field configuration\nfrom the photosphere to the "source" surface. Comparisons with interplanetary magnetic field observations suggest the model is able to\ntrace the open field lines leading from the sun. Coronal green line\nobservations suggest that the closed loop pattern in the inner corona\nmay also be traced.\nComparisons with interplanetary magnetic field observations\nsuggest that new photospheric magnetic features do not make their\npresence known to the interplanetary sector pattern for about a solar\nrotation.

The\ndevelopment of the region is consistent with the "source" surface\nmodel calculations that show the development of magnetic loops in the\ninner corona. The evolution of the region is also suggested by the\ncoronal green line observations. The magnetic fluxes in the bipolar\nregion, the magnetic loop and the resultant sector are in good agreement both in sense and in magnitude.

The\ncharacteristic times of the motion usually range from 3 to 15 min.\nSometimes longer-period motions are encountered, probably owing to\nsolar-wind pressure changes. The 3 to IS^min motions are believed to\nbe due to hydromagnetic disturbances on the magnetopause. The existence of these large-amplitudes waves on the magnetopause show that this\nis hot a stable boundary, but the relevant instability cannot be established by the present experiment. However, the magnetopause motions\ncan be shown to be coherent over distances of the order of 10 Kg, since\nthe bow-shock motions measured on the same satellite pass are found to\nhave well correlated amplitudes and characteristic times. Further\nevidence for the association of energetic electron bow shock spikes\nwith motions of.the magnetopause is given. A further experimental result is that the intense bow shock electron spikes lie in the magnetosheath just behind the"bow shock.

This\nanisotropy gradually decays as the amplitude of the fluctuation increases\nand tends to become rather isotropic.

Res., 7\xc2\xa3, 5189-5201, 1971.\nA detailed signature for individual substorms is sought in the\ninterplanetary medium. Hourly values of interplanetary field and plasma\nparameters are correlated with hourly averages of the AE index. Ah interplanetary variable involving the southward component of the interplanetary field in the solar magnetospheric coordinate system is shown to be\nsingularly important for the generation of substorms. The parameter best\ncorrelated with AE (0.8 correlation coefficient) is the integral or\nsummation of Bz south over time for the hour preceding the AE hourly\naverage. The magnitude of this integral appears to be linearly related\nto the hourly average of AE. The linearity suggests that the southward\ninterplanetary field represents a continuing dynamic mechanism for the\nproduction of substorms rather than just being a trigger for the release\nof energy that has been stored in the magnetospheric tail. Furthermore,\nthe additional energy that the southward component of the interplanetary\nfield apparently puts into the tail is not accumulated for longer than\nabout 1 hour before it appears as a substorm.

The solar magnetospheric\nEg component is proportionately larger within that region than outside of it. 62 is found to decrease with distance from the earth\nbut to be positive on average within the depressed field region out\nto a distance of 70 RE, indicating that while for\'short periods of\ntime the neutral line may be closer to the earth than the orbital\ndistance of the moon, on average it is beyond that distance. A\nnegative BZ component was found in 2/3 of the measurements outside\nthe depressed field region. This analysis has shown tnat the magnetotail field diverges on the order of 5\xc2\xb0 from the tail axis. This\nresult together with the BZ observations supports a geometry in which\nfor large |zsm| the tail field is diverging in the Zsm as well as\nthe Ysm direction, but is converging slightly toward the neutral\nsheet within the depressed field region. The observed divergence\nproduces an increase in the radius of the tail of approximately 3.8\nRjr between distances of 20 RE and 70 RE from the earth. The combination of expanding tail and reconnection at the neutral sheet can\naccount for an inverse power law field magnitude gradient of the form\nB \xc2\xab |x|~\xc2\xb0\'3.

The magnetic field\nexperiment onboard the spacecraft consists of a triaxial fluxgate\nsensor with a maximum dynamic range of + 64 gammas and a sensitivity\nof |H 0.25 gammas along each axis. Because of the initial apogee-earthsun angle of 118\xc2\xb0 west of the sun, the first 8 orbits of Explorer 33\n(July 1 to Nov. 11, 1966) mapped the earth\'s magnetosheath and magnetic\ntail from the western flank.of the bow shock to the eastern flank. This\nmapping of the geomagnetic tail out to 80 earth radii established that\nthe tail extends beyond the lunar orbital distance. Explorer 33 has\nalso found that the earth\'s bow shock is still a detectable boundary\nbetween the interplanetary magnetic field and the downstream magnetosheath at a geocentric distance of 75.7 earth radii. The measurements\nhave further suggested that the cross section of the geomagnetic tail\nis probably not cylindrical and have shown that the magnetic field\nmagnitude in the tail decreases with distance down the tail from the\nearth.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDl-03\n\nBehannon, K.W., and D.H.

Sonett\n\nNASA/Ames Research Center\n\nThe Ames magnetometer experiment consisted of a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer\xe2\x80\xa2and an electronics package. The sensors\nwere orthogonally mounted with one sensor oriented along the spin axis\nof the spacecraft. A motor interchanged a sensor in the spin plane\nwith the sensor along the spin axis every 24 hr, allowing inflight\ncalibration. The instrument package included a circuit for spin demodulating the outputs from the sensors in the spin plane. The noise\nthreshold was <0.4y. The instrument had three ranges covering \xc2\xb120, .\n\xc2\xb160, and \xc2\xb1200y full scale for each vector component. The digitization\naccuracy was 1% of the entire range covered for each range. The\nmagnetic field vector was measured instantaneously, and the instrument\nrange was changed after each measurement. A period of 2.05 sec\nelapsed between adjacent measurements and 6.14 sec between measurements\nusing the same range. The instrument performance was normal until the\nfinal spacecraft transmission on May 31, 1971.\n\n.\n\nPrincipal Investigator Group/Major Journals\n\nD2-01\n\nGreen, I.M., E i W ; Greeiistadt; G.T.

The resultant disturbance in the solar wind was observed by\nthe Los Alamos plasriia probe on Vela 3A and the Ames Research Center\nmagnetometer on Explorer 33.

This extreme angle of tipping\nindicates that the shock from this flare did hot propagate spherically\nfrom the sun as described by simple theory. Nine hours after the\nshock passed, plasma containing 22% helium was observed. Sirice the\nsolar wind normally contains 4% helium, this observation adds to\nthe increasing body of evidence that flares occur in regions relatively\nrich in helium. The velocity of the solar wind continued to increase\nafter the helium plasma passed, i.e., at 1 AU the helium-enriched\nmaterial was still being propelled from behind. This observation is\nevidence that the plasma continued to be accelerated at the sun for an\nextended period of time after the flash phase of the flare.\n\n110\n\nD2-04\n\nMihalov, J.Di, "On Geomagnetic Tail Structure Near the Null\n\nSheet."

In this paper we investigate whether the magnetotail changes occur only as a consequence of\nsubstorms or also as a direct consequence of changes in the solar wind parameters. Using data from several satellites (OGO 5, ATS 1, Imp 4, Explorer\n33 and 35) and 17 ground magnetic observatories, we conclude that the tail\nresponds to both changes in the north-south orientation of the interplanetary field and substorm activity. Specifically, we show the following.\n(1) A change from a northward to a southward interplanetary field causes\na slow increase of the field to be recorded by a satellite within the lobe\nof the tail, and a thinning of the plasma sheet. (2) A change from a southward, to a northward interplanetary field causes the plasma sheet to expand.\nIn contrast, it seems that in the inner magnetosphere the distortion of the\nmagnetic field due to a period of southward interplanetary field is not\nrelieved by an interval of northward field but only through the occurrence\nof a substorm expansion. (3) A substorm expansion causes a slow decrease\nof the field within the lobe of the tail and an expansion of the plasma\nsheet.\n\nD2-16\n\nDungey, J.W., and D.J. Southwood, "Ultra Low Frequency Waves in\nthe Magnetosphere," Space Science Reviews, 10, 672-688, 1970.\nThe behaviour of continuous pulsations pc 2-5 observed on the\nground has been known for some time. They seldom occur at night,\ntheir amplitudes generally increase towards the auroral zones and\nthe sense of rotation of their polarisation often agrees with surface\nwaves on the magnetopause. Recently ULF sonagrams for middle latitudes\nhave shown systematic behaviour and dominant periods. Theoretical\nstudy of normal modes for symmetrical models is also well established.\nIf the wave depends on longitude 4> like eun<^\', modes with large m are\nquasi-transverse and these are likely to be excited and will be emphasised.\nThe Kelvin-Helmholtz instability has recently been studied in a\ngeneral formulation. For given fields and plasma properties on both\nsides of the boundary, a plot of critical wind speed against the\ndirection pf the wave fronts shows a cusp, meaning that for most directions of the wind the onset of instability will correspond to the cusp\nand the nature of the waves can be predicted from this. Almost circularly polarised waves are predicted confirming an earlier heuristic\nsuggestion.\nMagnetic data from Explorer 33 shows rather irregular disturbance\nnear the magnetopause, but an integration designed to show the sense\nof rotation of the polarisation shows clear agreement. The disturbance outside the magnetopause also shows the predicted polarisation,\nindicating that a substantial part of it must be due to surface waves,\nwhereas previously it was believed to be the turbulence of the magnetosheath.\nBounce resonance has also been invoked to excite ULF waves, particularly those observed at the geostationary orbit, which may also\ncorrespond to pg at the ground. They are remarkably regular and\nquite strictly transverse, suggesting large m. Energetic particles\nmay then see a higher frequency as a result of their drift. A simple\n\n114\n\npicture of the exchange of energy is obtained using a frame rotating\nwith the wave and it is seen that the wave can be driven by a spatial\ngradient in the energetic particles. The most important mechanism is\ndue to the tilting of the field lines and the growth rate can be large.\nThe reflection by the ionosphere requires further study.\n\nD2-17\n\nWilcox, J.M., "Statistical Significance of the Proposed Heliographic Latitude Dependence of the Dominant Polarity of the\nInterplanetary Magnetic Field," J.

High values of the N/S ratio early in the event corresponded to an extraordinarily strong anisotropy of intensity in interplanetary space with the anisotropy vector pointing dominantly southward. The N/S ratio dropped toward 1 as the interplanetary beam relaxed toward isotropy. Similar, though less well determined, findings\napplied to protons Ep > 3.4 MeV and alpha particles Ea > 1.18 MeV.\nThe directions of interplanetary field lines that connect with the\nrespective polar caps are uniquely identified by intensity considerations.\nThe interplanetary magnetic vector was measured on Explorer 35 also.\nEarly in the event, the earth was in a solar positive (B outward from\nthe sun) magnetic sector (<j>SE ~ 140\xc2\xb0) , with a dominantly southward\ndirection (Ogg ~ -40\xc2\xb0 to -70\xc2\xb0).

Rev.,\n186, No. 1, 143-150, Oct. 1969.\nA theory is presented to explain the observed variations of the\nmagnetic field and plasma in the vicinity of the moon. Under the\n\n119\n\nguiding-center approximation, solutions for the plasma flow near the\nmoon are obtained from the kinetic equation. The creation of a plasma\ncavity in the core region of the lunar optical shadow disturbs the\ninterplanetary magnetic field. Maxwell\'s equations are used to study\nperturbations of the magnetic field in the lunp.r wake. The acceleration drift current, which was omitted from the earlier work, is included in the present theory in the calculation of the total electric\ncurrent in the lunar wake. Numerical solutions of Maxwell\'s equations\nare obtained. When the interplanetary magnetic field lines penetrate\ninto the lunar body, due to sudden change of magnetic permeability\nthe magnetic field is disturbed at the lunar limbs. Propagations of\nthis disturbance with magnetoacoustic speed form a Mach cone downstream,\nwhich is sometimes observed,as the exterior increase of field magnitude\nin the lunar penumbra. Perturbations of the magnetic field are restricted to the region inside the Mach cone; the region outside remains\nundisturbed. The numerical results agree extremely well with experimental data from the Explorer 35 spacecraft.\n\nEl-17\n\nWhang, Y.C., "Interaction of the Magnetized Solar Wind with the\nMoon," Phys. Fluids. 11, No. 5, 969-975, May 1968.\nThe experimental results obtained from the Explorer 35 spacecraft\nindicate that a detached bow shock wave does not exist in the vicinity\nof the moon. Thus, the flow conditions near the moon do not resemble\nthose near the magnetosphere of the earth. The solar-wind flow around\nthe moon is treated theoretically as a free-molecule flow of guidingcenter plasma. Analytical results are obtained to describe the ion flow\nin the vicinity of the moon. The disturbed region forms a long wake in\nthe downstream of the moon. The thickness of the wake, measured perpendicular to the plane of the solar-wind velocity and the interplanetary magnetic field, is constant at one lunar diameter. On the other\nhand, the width of the wake, measured parallel to that plane, increases\nwith distance from the moon.\n\nEl-18\n\nWhang, Y.C., "Theoretical Study of the Magnetic Field in the Lunar\nWake," Phys. of Fluids, LI, 1713-1719, Aug. 1968.\nWhen the solar wind interacts with the moon, the plasma shadow\nregion on the dark side of the moon forms a long lunar wake. In the\nplasma umbra a detectable plasma flow is absent, and in the penumbra\nthe plasma flux increases from the void condition in the umbra to the\ninterplanetary condition outside. A theoretical model for perturbations of the magnetic field in the plasma shadow is studied by\ndirectly solving Maxwell\'s equations for steady-state solutions. The\nperturbation of the field is assumed to be due to the magnetization\ncurrent, the gradient drift current, and the curvature drift current.\nNumerical solutions are obtained to describe the variations of the\nmagnetic field, and the results are in good agreement with experimental\nobservations from the Explorer 35 satellite.\n\nEl-19\n\nWhang, Y.C., and N.F.

The axis of the Mach cone indicates that\n\n120\n\nthe direction of the solar wind comes from ~4.5\xc2\xb0 west of the sun as\nviewed from the moon.

The\nlack\xe2\x80\xa2of. axial symmetry of the observed lunar Mach cone provides the\nfirst experimental evidence for the anisotropic .propagation of magnetoacoustic -waves in the solar wind. The\'average Mach angle is found to\nbe .~8\xc2\xb0 in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field vector, \'\nand ~5.5\xc2\xb0 in the direction parallel to the field leading to a velocity\nanisotropy of VA/V,, = 1.4.

The magnetic field is found to be only slightly,\ndistorted with no evidence for.a bow shock wave. During the interval\nFebruary to July 1968, periselene passed through the solar wind umbral\nregion. A study of the propagation of discontinuities in the interplanetary magnetic field through the lunar body has been completed.\nThe induction of electrical currents in the lunar interior indicates\nan effective time constant for eddy current decay of less than 20.\nseconds. This means an electrical conductivity of less than lO"1* mhos/\nmeter in the lunar interior. The electrical conductivity of silicate\nrocks depends mainly\'upon temperature. Thus limitations on possible\nthermal.models of the moon, consistent with the electrical conductivity\nmeasurementsi can be obtained. These results are compared with various\nmodels of the thermal history to obtain a class of allowed lunar interiors. The conclusion is that the moon must be a relatively young\nbody (1 x 109 years old) if it possesses a homogeneous\' heat source . .\ncomposition similar to chondritic meteorites. If differentiation of\nradiogenic heat sources near to the surface has taken place, the moon\ncan be old (4 x 109 years).\n\xe2\x80\xa2\' \'\n\n|\n\nEl-21 Ness, N.F., "Interaction of the Solar Wind with the Moon," NASAGSFC, X-692-70-141, Apr. 1970.

A\ndownward penumbral region aft of a rarefaction wave or Mach cone, ellip-\n\n121\n\n..\n\ntical in cross sectional geometry, contains a reduced plasma flux and\nmagnetic field. A very limited penumbral region, upwind of the lunar\nMach cone, sometimes contains an enhanced magnetic field and plasma\nflux. A broad region both upstream and downstream from the lunar wake\nis connected to it by the interplanetary magnetic field in which rapid\nfluctuations of the magnetic field occur with an amplitude that decreases with distance from the wake.\n\nEl-22 Ness, N.F., "Recent Results from Lunar Explorer 35," NASA-GSFC,\nX-616-68-335, Sept. 1968. (Paper presented at the Conference on\nthe Physics of the Moon and Planets, Kiev, USSR, Oct. 1968.)\nMeasurements since July 1967 from lunar orbit by Explorer 35 have\nprovided significant data on the moon and its environment. When the\nmoon is imbedded in the geomagnetic tail, no intrinsic lunar magnetic\nfield is detected, limiting its magnetic moment to 1020 cgs units, less\nthan 10~6 of the earth\'s. This corresponds to an intrinsic lunar field\nof less than 40 y Gauss on the lunar surface. The magnetic susceptibility of the moon is less than 1.8 Vo if the interior is below the\nCurie point. In interplanetary space no evidence is found for a bow\nshock wave due to the flow of the supersonic solar wind plasma past\nthe moon. A solar plasma shadow or cavity evolves on the nightside of\nthe moon as the moon absorbs the plasma with small perturbations of the\nmagnitude and direction of the interplanetary magnetic field. The\nimbedded interplanetary magnetic field appears to diffuse as rapidly\nthrough the interior of the moon as the solar wind convectively transports it past the moon.\n\nEl-23\n\nNess, N.F., Y.C.

However,\nnot all sudden changes observed in the tail field have associated Sis.\nThe characteristics of these observed Sis are discussed, and velocities\nof the propagation in the tail from 870 to 1300 km per sec are obtained.\nThere is an indication that some of the sudden impulses were originated\nin the tail and propagated to the surface of the earth. Also, in some\nevents the sudden impulses originated on the sunward side of the magnetosphere and propagated into the tail. Possible mechanisms for the\ngeneration of the Sis are discussed. Two events of micropulsations\nassociated with the sudden impulses are also found.

Lyon, J.H. Binsack, arid H.S. Bridge, "Experimental Evidence for a Detached Lunar Compression Wave," J. Ge.bphys.\nRes., 74-, 59-69, 1969.\nThe behavior of the solar-wind flux and direction measured on\nExplorer 35 in the near lunar wake is presented. The flux near the\nleading edge of the wake tends to be greater than the free-stream\nvalue and decreases below detectabllity near the wake axis. There is\nprobably a small (<. 3\xc2\xb0) deflection of the wind away from the moon near\nthe leading edge and a deflection toward the wake axis in the region of\nreduced flux. These features correlate well with variations in the\nmagnetic field. An interpretation of the observed structure is offered\nthat utilizes the theory of two-dimensional steady simple waves in\nmagnetohydrodynamics. A novel feature of the interpretation is the\ninference of a deflection of the solar wind from the region of the.\nlunar limb to account for the structure near the leading edge of the\nwake.\n\nE2\n\nAmes Magnetometer\nC.P; Sonett\n\nNASA/Ames Research Center\n\nThe Ames magnetometer experiment consisted of a boom-mounted\ntriaxial fluxgate magnetometer and an electronics package.

The boundary surfaces are shown to have normal vectors from\nwhich an average tail aberration induced by the earth\'s heliocentric\nmotion of 9 (plus or minus 5) deg and a flaring half-angle of about 9\ndeg is found. The boundary is assumed to be a tangential discontinuity.\nThe average ecliptic diameter of the tail at lunar distance is 50 earth\nradii. Using 21 normal vectors, a statistical variation transverse to\nthe tail axis three times that along the axis is shown. This may corresppnd to magnetic perturbations induced by the Kelvln-Helmholtz instability; the variations of the unit normals are consistent with circumferential oscillations having wavelengths smaller by 1/3 to 1/10\nthan those of waves moving in the downstream direction. The circumferential oscillations appear to give evidence of fluting of the tail\nsurface. Several distinct types of boundary signature are identified.\nBoundary speeds which usually exceed typical spacecraft velocities of\nabout 1 km/sec are deduced from simple models of boundary motion. Implied boundary thicknesses are usually about 1000 km, but perhaps are\nas low as about 30 km in some instances.

Res., 74, 3541-3553,\n1969.\nFifty orbits of Explorer 34 data have been used to study 0.01-0.05\nHz transverse waves in the interplanetary medium region between the bow\nshock and the spacecraft apogee of 34 Rg. It is concluded that the\nwaves are associated with the earth\'s bow shock since they only occur\nwhen projection of the interplanetary field observed at the spacecraft\nintersects the shock. The waves are observed 18.5% of the time when\na total of 134 days of interplanetary data is considered, but more than\n90% of the time when the field has the proper orientation with respect\nto the bow shock. On the basis of this result it is suggested that\nthese waves with 20-100 second periods are a permanent feature of the\nsolar wind-earth interaction. The transverse component of the waves\nis typically several gammas in amplitude in 4-8 gamma fields. The\ndisturbance vector in the XY plane generally exhibits the same sense\nof rotation in a coordinate system where the field is oriented along the\npositive Z axis. Attenuation of wave amplitudes with distance from the\nbow shock is estimated to be only a factor of 2 when the -spacecraft is\n15 RE from the bow shock. The absence of waves at particular field\norientations, even though the field line intersects the shock, is interpreted as a propagation effect.

Res., 75, 7032-7047, 1970.\nIMP 4 vector magnetic field measurements and the geomagnetic AE\nindex are utilized in studying the configuration of the geomagnetic\ntail within 34 RE and its variations during substorms. The existence\nof a depressed field magnitude region corresponding to the average\nposition of the plasma sheet is confirmed and the average solar magneto^pheric component of the field is found to be northward and independent of distance from the expected position of the neutral sheet\nfor Zgw < 8Rg; The Z^ component measured some distance from the\nequatorial plane is a measure of flux crossing the neutral sheet and\ncan be studied as a function of time during substorms. Prior to and\nduring the early phases of a substorm\'the tail field magnitude increases\nand the northward field component decreases as the plasma sheet becomes\nthin. Later \'in the substonn the field magnitude decreases and the\nnorthward field component increases as the tail field relaxes to a more\ndipolar state. The greater number of field lines crossing the neutral\nsheet after the substorm is consistent with an expanded plasma sheet\nand supports\'reconnection theories; Enhanced Zgj^ components after\nsubstorms and during the rare occurrences of very quiet intervals suggest\' that many more field lines close-near the earth and fewer go into\nthe geomagnetic tail at these times.\n\nFl-08\n\nFairfield, D.H., and N.F.

Power spectra\nhave been computed in the frequency range below 0.2 Hz in a fieldaligned coordinate system which allows the separation of transverse\narid longitudinal perturbations. Power levels of different passes\nthrough the magnetosheath typically vary by an order of magnitude or\nmore and spectral peaks are frequently seen throughout the frequency\nrange studies. Spatial variations of wave amplitudes are characterized by enhancements of the transverse mode near both the shock and\nthe magnetopause but these variations tend to be smaller than the day\nto day variations. The dawn quadrant of\' the magnetosheath tends to\nexhibit a somewhat higher level of fluctuations. .Transverse waves\nare often linearly polarized arid they tend to have\'their disturbance\nvector aligned with\'the shock and magnetopause surfaces.\nCongressional\nfluctuations tend to be larger than transverse fluctuations at low\nfrequencies but transverse amplitudes dominate at higher frequencies.\nOn three unique orbits when the bow shock was located more then 9 Rg\noutside its average location the magnetosheath power levels were depressed by more than an order of magnitude below their normal lowest\nlevels. "Transverse fluctuations were dominant at these times. A\nweak positive correlation was found, between magnetosheath fluctuations\nand geomagnetic .activity.\n"\n,\n\n.

Electrons are found to have a Maxwellian distribution\nat energies below 2.0 ev with a component of higher energy. The electron temperature typically increases from above the ionosphere\'as the\nsquare of the radial distance, whereas the number density decreases\napproximately as the inverse cube of the distance out to 5 Rg. From\n5 to 15.9 Rg (apogee) the temperature remains between 1.0 and 2.6 ev,\nand the number density remains between 25 and 50 electrons/cm"3. It\nis verified that the observed positive ion density of 25-50 car3 is in\nagreement with the number of electrons observed\'per unit volume in the\nsolar wind region. The location of the magnetopause is not evident in\nthe low-energy electrons; however, a small temperature increase is\nnoted at the shock boundary. An intensity increase is noted in the\nenergetic electron component in the magnetosheath. Data for a six-month\nperiod covering a 180\xc2\xb0 sector of the earth\'s environment is reported\non.

The emphasis of the study is toward achieving\na unified view of all the experimental results, both of this study\nand previous studies. Various statistical studies of the relationship\nbetween Kp and parameters of the solar wind were carried out. The\neffect of the direction of the Z component of the interplanetary field\nis confirmed. In all other statistical studies the data were divided\ninto two groups, one in which the 3-hr average field pointed northward,\nand the other in which it pointed southward. In this way, we show,\nfor example, that the tendency toward an association of high K_ with\nintense interplanetary fields is independent of the North-South effect.\nOther statistical investigations were also carried out. The Sun was\nconsiderably disturbed during the period covered by this study, giving\nan excellent opportunity to observe the magnetic configuration of flareinduced interplanetary storms and their relation to geomagnetic storms.\nThe interplanetary storm was found to be typified by persistent, strong\nfields (up to 30 y) that rise far out of the ecliptic plane. As discussed below, this is to be expected on the basis of simple models.\nFurther, it was found that high-velocity plasma and intense, highly\ndisturbed interplanetary fields are also typical of interplanetary\nstorms. The close association of these parameters in the interplanetary medium is one cause of confusion in interpretations of geomagnetic\nstudies. During the flare-produced storm of .February 15, 1967, there\nwas a remarkably close temporal association between events in space\nand on the surface.

A simple hydrodynamic calculation of wave drag\neffects gives approximate agreement with observed magnitudes, but\nthe wake region appears to be somewhat larger than expected. Possible\neffects to account for this include heat diffusion out of the wake and a\ntwo-fluid effect in which ions are heated more than electrons at the\nbow shock.

The other was provided by the space probe\nMariner 5, which was moving towards the sun. Each spacecraft carried\na plasma measuring instrument. We shall discuss observations made by\nthese instruments during the period June 25-26, and on August 11, 1967.\nDuring June, the spacecraft were relatively close to each other, but\nfor the August event they were separated by about 0.1 A.U. and were\non the Sun-Earth line. The transit times for the solar plasma between\nthe two spacecraft were approximately one hour and approximately seven\nhours respectively.\nExamination of the data shows a high degree of\ncorrelation between the measurements made at both separations indicating that features in the solar wind retain their identity over distances of the order of 0.1 AU.\n\n150\n\nF3-10\n\nOgilvie, K.W., and J.F.

Particular attention is given to the interaction of discontinuities with the earth and to changes in the abundance of helium\nin the plasma.\' Detailed comparisons with magnetic field observations\non the same satellite.are used to interpret the observations and to\nidentify shocks and tangential discontinuities. The observations\nare consistent with the relationship derived by Siscoe (1966) between\nthe magnitude of such sudden changes in the earth\'s magnetic field\nand the solar wind parameters. The local shock speeds are derived\nfrom data obtained at the time of the sudden commencements. An example\nof an si+ si~ pair is discussed, and irj this case "the negative impulse\nis shown to\'be due to a tangential discontinuity-rather than a shock,\nwhereas the positive impulse is associated with a shock. Helium\nobservations are described which show that during the main phase of\nsome geomagnetic storms the abundance ratip na/np -shows a marked\nincrease.

These ions are completely\n\n151\n\nseparated by means of electrostatic and magnetic fields. The average\nvalue of the ratio of number densities is 0.051 + .02, derived from\nover 3000 h of measurement.

A tentative association\nwith some geomagnetic storms is suggested. The above value of abundance, assuming that plasma emitted in the ecliptic plane is a fair\nsample of the output of the sun, combined with other recent work by\nother methods indicate that the solar abundance may be about half the\npreviously quoted estimates of approximately 0.1.\n\n.

These measurements\nare the continuation of similar studies, begun in 1964, of the temporal\nvariation of the spectra of these particles. The results obtained-from\nthe period 1964 to 1966 indicated that these particles were a mixture\nof particles of galactic and solar origin. The 1967 measurements show\nthat, despite an increase in solar activity and modulation of relativistic cosmic rays, the 2 to 20 MeV - fluxes of protons and alpha particles\nremained relatively unchanged. The implications of this result are discussed.\n\nA7-09 Fan, C . Y . , G. Gloeckler, and J.A.

Institute of Physics and the Physical Society, London,\nEngland.)\nPulses of high energy electrons were observed in the vicinity of\nthe bow shock of the terrestrial magnetosphere with both the Au-Si\nsurface barrier solid state detector (the front detector of the cosmic\nray telescope of the University of Chicago) and the GM counter (University of California) on board the IMP-1 satellite. These particle\npulses were also detected inside the shock transition region with GM\ncounters in earlier satellites. There is experimental evidence that\nthese electrons are accelerated in the shock transition region. By\ncomparing the counting rates of the solid state detector and that of\nthe GM counter on board IMP-1, the energy spectrum of the electrons\nmay be estimated. If the integral spectrum is expressed as F = FQ\xc2\xa3-Y,\nthe value of y varies from +2.5 to +4.5. Beyond the shock.transition\nregion up to the apogee of the IMP-1 satellite (200,000 km), pulses of\nhigh energy particles were also observed with the Au-Si solid state\n\n169\n\ndetector prior to the arrival of the 27-day recurrent solar plasma of\nenhanced velocity. It is suggested that these are particles accelerated in space by multiple shock waves associated with the co-rotating\nshock front.\n\nA7-10\n\nFan, C.Y., G. Gloeckler, and J.A.

Institute of Physics and the Physical\nSociety, London, England.)\nFrom IMP-1 measurements we showed in 1964 that fluxes of protons\nof greater than 1-Mev energy appeared for several days in a sequence\nof six consecutive 27-day intervals. We concluded that these protons\nwere confined within a region corotating with the sun which modulates\nthe galactic cosmic radiation at the orbit of earth with the same 27day recurrence period. This region has persisted for more than 20\nsolar rotations and was observed with the IMP-1 magnetometer by Ness\nand Wilcox to possess special characteristics. The energy spectrum of\nthe protons in the leading and trailing sides of the corotating region\nwas measured. A helium component continuously associated with the\nprotons has been found with an energy spectrum of the form proportional\nto E~2 Mev/nucleon in the energy range 2 to 30 Mev/nucleon. Evidence\nfrom the OGO 1 satellite indicates that the proton and helium fluxes\nare not only present within corotating regions, but are also present\nat lower intensity and with different spectra at all times throughout\na 2-1/2 month period. The source for continual acceleration of these\nprotons and helium nuclei is discussed.\n\nA7-11\n\nFan, C.Y., G. Gloeckler, and J.A.

(Proceedings held in London, England, Sept. 6-17,\n1965. Institute of Physics and the Physical Society, London,\nEngland.)\nTime variations in the differential energy spectrum and flux of\nprimary helium nuclei in the energy range 30 to 90 Mev/nucleon have\nbeen studied over the time period from Dec. 1963 to Jan. 1965. Continuous measurements over most of the 1-yr period were made using\n(dE/dx,E) type solid state, charged-particle telescopes which were\nflown on two satellites (IMP 1 and IMP 2) which had highly eccentric\norbits. The helium spectra obtained are well represented by a power\ndependence of the type a E+Y where E is the particle total kinetic\nenergy. The exponent y changed from 1.75 to 1.3 in the 1-yr period\nwhile the flux of helium increased by about 75% in the same time interval. Since in addition to this observed modulation, the helium\nnuclei were continuously present and since the spectrum extends smoothly into the higher energy spectrum measured on balloons, we are convinced that we are observing the low-energy extension of the modulated\nlocal galactic helium spectrum. From the measured fractional helium\nintensity increases with time we are able to deduce that the modulation\ndepends predominantly on the particle velocity.\n\n170\n\n, Principal Investigator Group/Other Publications\nA7-12\n\nBridge, H.S., G.P.

The delay was also a function of distance of the satellite from\nthe centre of the plasma sheet, and of the magnitude of the intensity\n\n173\n\n.\n\nincrease (smaller delays for larger intensity increases). We deduce\nthat the disturbance producing the magnetic bays and associated particle\nacceleration originates fairly deep in the magnetpsphere and propagates\noutward to higher L values, and down the plasma sheet in the Earth\'s\nmagnetic tail on the dark side of the Earth. It is unlikely that the\naccelerated electrons are themselves drifting away from the Earth, because the apparent velocity with which the islands move away from the\nEarth decreases with increasing distance from the Earth.\nIt is suggested that the polar substorm and the associated particle\nacceleration are part of an impulsive ejection mechanism of magnetospheric energy into the ionosphere,.rather than an impulsive injection\nmechanism of solar wind energy into the magnetosphere.\n\nB6\n\nScintillator and GM Telescopes\nF.B.

The duration of individual events is from less than a minute up to several\nminutes, but they tend to occur in clusters lasting as long as several\nhours. Their flux is usually a few hundred cm"2 sec"1, but occasionally it reaches 3 x lO1* cm"2 sec"1 for electrons >40 kev. The upstream\nelectron spikes are associated with rapid motion of the bow shock.

The event is divided into three parts: the ordinary diffusive\ncomponent, the halo, and the core.

Upper limits\nto the interplanetary transverse diffusion coefficient for 4 to 20 MeV\nprotons at 1 AU are derived from the width of the halo. These are at\nleast two orders of magnitude less than the parallel diffusion coefficient for the same energy particles.

In particular, intense type III radio\nbursts are observed to accompany solar electron-event flares. The\nenergies of tKe electrons, the total number of electrons, and the size\nof the electron source at the sun can be inferred from radio observations.. The characteristics of the electrons observed in the interplanetary space are consistent with these radio observations. Therefore\' these electrons are identified as the exciting agents of the type\nIII emission. It has been noted that the radio and X-ray bursts are\npart of the flas\'h phase of flares. The observations indicate that a\nstriking feature of the flash phase is the production of electrons of\n10-100 keV energies.\n\nC5-14 Lin, R.P.,,,"The Emission and Propagation of -40 keV Solar Electrons,\':1 Acta Physica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 29,\nSupplement 2, 669-677, 1970.(Proceedings of the llth International Conference on Cosmic Rays, Budapest, Hungary, 1969.)\nSince the first spacecraft observations of ~40 keV solar electrons\nin 1965 over 130 such electron events have been detected by the essentially continuous monitoring of the IMP (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform) satellites. -These impulsive ~40 keV electron events are closely\nassociated with solar flares and are the most common type of energetic\nsolar particle emission. Studies of the relationship of these electron\nevents to-other solar phenomena, in particular solar proton and relativistic. energy solar electron events; indicate that tKe acceleration\nand emission of -40 keV solar electrons is a phenomenon distinct from\nthe production of solar protons and relativistic electrons. A close\ncorrelation is evident between ~40 keV electron events and flash phase\nphenomena such as X-ray and radio bursts. For the small flares commonly\nassociated with ~40 keV electron events the production of such particles\nmust constitute a major flare process. The propagation of ~40 keV eletrons has been studied. The transit time, rise time to maximum.arid\ndecay time all show no solar longitude dependence. These results indicate that, these electrons are released over a large area of the sun and\nth\'at subsequently the propagation of these electrons can best be described in terms of a cone of propagation defined by the interplanetary\nmagnetic field lines which thread the electron production and/or storage\nregion at the sun.\n\n.\n\nPrincipal Investigator Group/Other Publications\n\nC5-15\n\n"Final Report.for Energetic Particle Studies on the First Interplanetary Monitoring Satellites (July 1, 1962 to June 30, 1967),"\nUniversity of California, Space Science Lab.

(Ph.D. Thesis)\nThe observations of >40 keV solar flare electrons by the IMP-III\nand Explorer 33 satellites are used to study the emission of such\n\n182\n\nelectrons from the sun and their propagation in the interplanetary\nmedium; It is found that there is very little diffusion transverse\nto the interplanetary magnetic field lines for these electrons in,their\npropagation from the sun to the earth, and that the angular extent of\nthe cone of propagation in interplanetary space filled with electrons\nreflects the angular size of the source at the sun. This size is\ntypically about 30\xc2\xb0 solar longitude, but ranges up to 90\xc2\xb0 \'for electron\nevents which occur at the time that a type I radio noise storm is\ncovering a similar angular extent of the solar disc. The time behavior\nof the solar electron fluxes does not fit well to the power law decay\npredicted by the model of.impulsive point source injection into an\ninfinite diffusing medium, but rather exhibits an exponential decay\nin time as would be expected for the\'injection of these particles into\na bounded diffusing medium. The large enduring pitch angle anisotropies\nwhich are often observed for these electron fluxes indicates that the\nelectrons are essentially escaping beyond 1 A.U., and therefore the\ndiffusing medium must be bounded inside ;1 A.U. The diffusion of solar\nelectrons may occur close to the sun. Comparisons of solar proton and\nelectron onset times for mixed events indicates that the electrons are\ninjected into the interplanetary medium earlier than the protons. Moreover, the proton fluxes on occasion show highly structured spatial\nvariations which are not evident in the simultaneously observed electron\nfluxes. It is suggested that the solar protons and electrons are produced in different regions of the solar atmosphere; electrons in the\nupper chromosphere or lower corona and protons in the strong \'magnetic\nfield regions, in the lower chromosphere. The electron events are found\nto be accompanied by type III radio emission and impulsive centimeter,\nand X-ray emission, all of which appear to be associated with the optical\nflash phase which occurs for many flares. The electron, radio, and^.\nX-ray emission by-the flare can all be accounted for by the production\nof packets of 10\nelectrons of 10-100 keV energies. The characteristics of the electron streams which produce type III radio emission as\nthey escape the sun are completely consistent with the characteristics\nof the solar flare electrons observed by the satellites. The solar\nflare electrons observed by satellite are therefore tentatively identified as the same electrons which generate type III bursts at the sun.\n\n.

The ion chamber responded omnidirectionally to electrons with E > 0.7 Mev and protons with E > 12 Mev. Both GM\ntubes were mounted perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis. GM tube\nA detected electrons with E > 45 kev which were scattered off a gold\nfoil. The acceptance cone for these electrons had a full angle of 61\xc2\xb0\nand axis of symmetry which was perpendicular to the spacecraft spin\naxis.

These streams were\nsometimes associated with bright flares which occurred many hours\nearlier and sometimes no individual flare could be found. In the\nlatter case the particles are evidently to be 2~eociated in a general\nway with solar active centers as Fan et al (19f ) have done. The\nlong-lived solar events discussed here include energetic storm particles, delayed events and fluxes associated with solar active regions.\nIt is suggested here that these are all probably the same basic phe-\n\n190\n\nnomena viewed in somewhat different ways depending on the age of the\nregion and its location on the solar disc. These events are usually\nassociated with a depression in the sea-level neutron intensity and one\nor more sudden commencements of sudden impulses. Both electrons and\nprotons are present in these events but in several cases electrons were\nnot detected. The most unusual feature is that when both particle\nspecies are present, the electron flux is centered several hours before\nthe proton flux.\n\nD5-02\n\nDodson, H.W., E.R. Hedeman, S.W.

GM1 and the SSD were oriented perpendicular to\nthe spacecraft spin axis, GM2 was oriented parallel to the spin axis,\nand GM3 was oriented antiparallel to the spin axis. Data from GM1\nand pnl were divided into data from quadrants oriented with respect to\nthe sun (sectors I, II, III, and IV centered 180\xc2\xb0, 270\xc2\xb0, 0\xc2\xb0, and 90\xc2\xb0\nfrom the sun, respectively).

Detectable fluxes of protons Ep >0.31\nMev were measured to 10.4 Rg on the sunward side of the earth and, for\nthe first time with the present experiment, to 80 Rg in the magnetotail.\n\n192\n\nThe small proton fluxes (>5 per cm2-sec-ster) measured in the magnetotail were usually, anisotropic, with the largest flux apparently flowing\ndown the tail, away from the earth. When proton bursts occurred in the\ntail, there was usually increased high-latitude magnetic bay activity at\nthe earth. Durably trapped proton fluxes were observed to have intensities and spectra in agreement with previous measurements. A diurnal\nvariation (in the L coordinate system) was observed in the 0.31- to 10Mev trapped protons for L >6.6 RE.\n\nD6-02 Drake, J.F,, "Soft Solar X-ray Burst Characteristics," Solar\nPhys.. 16, 152, 1971.\nThe burst component of the solar x-ray flux in the soft wavelength\nrange 2 A < X < 12 A observed from Explorer 33 and Explorer 35 from\nJuly 1966 to September 1968 were analyzed. In this period 4028 burst\npeaks were observed.\nThe differential distributions of the temporal and intensity parameters of the bursts revealed no separation into more than one class of\nbursts. The most frequently observed value for rise time was 4 minutes\nand for decay time was 12 minutes. The distribution of the ratio of\nrise-to-decay time can be represented by an exponential with exponent\n-2.31 from a ratio of 0.3 to 2.7; the maximum in this distribution\noccurred at a ratio of 0.3. The values of the total observed flux,\ndivided by the background flux, at burst maximum, can be represented\nby a power law with exponent -2.62 for ratios between 1.5 and 32. The\ndistribution of peak burst fluxes can be represented by a power law\nwith exponent -1.75 over the range 1 - 100 milli-erg (cm2 sec)"1. The\nflux time integral values are given by a power law with exponent -1.44\nover the range 1 - 5 0 erg cm"2.\nThe distribution of peak burst flux as a function of Ha importance\nrevealed a general trend for larger peak x-ray fluxes to occur with both\nlarger Ha flares. The heliographic longitude dependence of soft x-ray\nbursts indicated no significant dependence of x-ray burst occurrence on\nheliographic longitude; the emission thus lacks directivity.\nThe theory of free-free emission by a thermal electron distribution\nwas applied to a quantitative explanation of both hard x-ray fluxes (data\nfrom Arnoldy, Kane, and Winckler [1968]; Kane and Winckler [1969]; and\nHudson, Peterson, and Schwartz [1969] and soft x-ray fluxes during solar\nx-ray bursts. Using bursts in three different energy intervals, covering\na total range of 1 - 50 keV, temperatures of 12 - 39 x 105 \xc2\xb0K and emission measures of 3.6 x 101*7 to 2.1 x 1050 cm"3 were derived. The emission measure was found to vary from event to event. The peak time of\nhard x-ray events was found to occur an average of 3 minutes before the\npeak time of the corresponding soft x-ray bursts. Thus a changing emission measure during the event is also required. A free-free emission process with temperatures of 12 - 39 x 106 \xc2\xb0K and with an emission measure\nin the range 3.6 x 1047 to 2.1 x 1050 cm 3 which varies both from event\nto event and within an individual event is required by the data examined.\n\nD6-03 Drake, J.F., J.

During the entire observing\nperiod of about 29 months the quiet sun flux lies between upper and\nlower bounds of 0.4 and 6.8 milli-erg (cm2 sec)"1, respectively, and\nthe monthly minima increase gradually from 0.4 to 1.0 milli-erg (cm2\nsec)"1 as the solar activity cycle progresses.\nA correlation study of F and the radio power density flux P at\n10.7 cm (Algonquin Radio Observatory) rejects a linear relationship\non both empirical and physical considerations but suggests a relationship of the form\n\nF = a exp (- ^-) .\n\nA least squares fit to the observed body of data yields a = 27.3 and\nb = 385.2, when F is in milli-erg (cm2 sec)"1 and P is in units of\n10~22 watt (m2 Hz)"1.\nOn the basis of a simple, moderately realistic physical model,\nthe foregoing relationship is found to be theoretically plausible\nfor an emitting volume of hot plasma at electron temperature T,\noptically thin for x rays, and optically thick for radio waves.

The data from Injuns 1 and 3 and Explorers 33 and 35, averaged\nin monthly intervals, show a long term variation in activity of at\nleast a factor of five between 1961 and 1969. A slowly varying component which tracks the 10 cm radio flux is observed in the X-ray flux.\nThis X-ray flux variation, about a factor of ten, is correlated with the\nappearance of major active regions on the solar disc. This slowly\nvarying componet is shown to correlate well with radio fluxes at frequencies greater than about 1 GHz and less well with radio fluxes at\nlower frequencies. The X-ray spectrum, obtained by comparing the 2-9 A\nflux with the 2-12 A flux, hardens during periods of high solar activity.\n\nD6-17\n\nWende, C.D., "Correlation of Solar Microwave and Soft X-ray\nRadiation 2.

In\n1958 the southern hemisphere was most active in producing surges, but\nthereafter the northern hemisphere has dominated the activity with increasing rate. The-average for the whole period shows that the northern\npart of the sun has been twice as\'actiye as the .southern part. The\nlatitude distribution for surges has varied with the solar cycle with a\npattern similar to the\'\'butterfly diagram for sunspots. The polar surges\nwere most frequent in the\'beginning of the new cycle.

The association rate\'between surges\nand -radio emission is dependent on both the solar cycle and the imporrtarice of the surge.

THe.,tbtal energy, loss\ndue to collisions is then computed from the integrated bremsstrahlung\nenergy loss during the non-thermal X-ray burst. .For.>22 keV flare\nelectrons the total energy loss due to collisions is found to be -ID1*\ntimes greater than the bremsstrahlung energy loss and ~10Z times\ngreater than the energy loss due to escaping electrons. Therefore the\nescape of electrons-into the interplanetary medium is a^riegligible\nenergetic electron loss mechanism arid cannot .be a substantial factor\nin the observed, decay of the non-thermal X-ray burst for these solar\nflares.\nWe present a picture of electron acceleration, energy loss and\nescape consistent with previous observations of an inverse relationship between rise and decay times of the non-thermal X-ray burst and\nX-ray energy. In this picture the acceleration of electrons occurs\nthroughout the 10-100 sec duration of the non-thermal X-ray burst and\ndetermines the time profile of the burst. The average energy of the\n\n205\n\naccelerated electrons first rises and then falls through the burst.\nCollisions with the ambient gas provide the dominant energetic electron loss mechanism with a loss time of < 1-sec. This picture is\nconsistent with the ratio of the total number of energetic electrons\naccelerated in the flare to the maximum instantaneous number of\nelectrons in the flare region. Typical values for the parameters derived from the X-ray and electron observations are:\ntotal energy\ncollisions\ntotal number\ntotal energy\ntotal energy\ntotal number\n\nin >22 keV electrons ~ total energy lost by\n= ~1028~29 erg,\nof electrons accelerated above 22 kieV = ~1036,\nlost by non-thermal bremsstrahlung = ~102"* erg,\nlost in escaping >22 keV electrons = ~1026 erp\nof >22 keV electrons escaping = ~1033~31*.\n\nThe total energy in electrons accelerated above 22 keV is comparable\nto the energy in the optical or quasi-thermal\'flare, implying a flare\nmechanism with particle acceleration as one of the dominant modes of\nenergy dissipation.\nThe overall efficiency for electron escape into the interplanetary medium is ~0.1-1% for these flares, and the spectrum of escaping\nelectrons is found to be substantially harder than the X-ray producing electrons.\n\nE5-11\n\nMeng, C..-I., "Energetic Electrons in the Magnetotail at 60RE,"\nJ.

It is shown that the large field aligned anisotropies\nwhich are observed during the rise time of a flare event change to an\nequilibrium anisotropy coming radially from the sunward direction due\nto the convective removal of the solar particles. At very late times\nduring the decay (T 2L 4 days) the anisotropy is observed to be fnjm a\nDirection ~45\xc2\xb0 east of the satellite-sun line and is parallel to E X\nB drift. The equilibrium anisotropy clearly indicates that convection\nis the determining process in the escape of the solar cosmic rays from\nthe interplanetary medium.

The dependence of the equilibrium anisotropy on the\nenergy and the velocity of the particles and on plasma velocity are\nshown to be in agreement with the theoretical predictions.

The lower energy fluxes exhibit characteristics of particle\nstorage either at the sun or in interplanetary space.

The ratio of particle\nfluxes before and after a sudden, discontinuous flux decrease (attributed to a sector boundary) is found to be ~R3 for protons and ~R6 for\nalphas for particles with rigidities <200 Mv.

(8) The proton and electron differential energy spectrums as viewed, in the solar direction in\nthe distant polar cusp (within several earth radii of the magnetopause)\nare identical to those observed within the magnetosheath tq. within observational accuracy. (9) The bulk velocity of protons in the distant\npolar cusp\'as deduced from the angular distributions appears to be lower\nthan that of the magnetosheath plasma near the magnetopause by factors\n~2 or 3. ( 0 In the midaltitude polar cusp at ~4 to 5 RE geocentric\n1)\nradial distances, the proton spectrum differs from that at the m^gnetosheath in that protons\'with energies\' S500 ev are severely less than those\nobserved in the magnetosheath\'.\' ( 1 The proton sp.ectrums in the midaiti1)\ntude polar cusp are s\'imilar. to those in the distant plasma sheet with the\nexception that the proton number densities in the polar cusp are typically\n\n233\n\nlarger by factors -20 to 200.\n(12) The angular distributions of proton\nintensities in\' the midaltitude polar cusp are strongly peaked along the\nlocal magnetic field (i\'.e. , down into the auroral zone); the tdimensions\nof the atmospheric loss cone at these altitudes appear to be insufficiently\nlarge to account for the observed anisotropy; and (13) the magnetosheath\nplasma in the midaltitude polar cusp is observed to be separated into two\nthin sheets, one of magnetosheath proton intensities and the other populated with magnetosheath electrons; these sheets are immediately adjacent\nto each other with the electron sheet equatorward of the\' proton sheet;\ntheir latitudinal widths as projected into the auroral zone are roughly\nequal, ~10 to 200 km. These observations, along with recent measure-,\nments from other earth satellites, have been interpreted in terms of a\nproposed magnetospheric model with several new features,- among which are\nthe following. (1) Plasma sheet protons gain access to the magnetospheric\nfield lines via the dayside polar cusps. (2) All magnetic field lines\nthreading the distant plasma sheet beyond ~20 or\'30 Kg were convictedfrom the polar cusps. (3) Magnetic field lines in the polar cap region\nof the magnetotail do not merge or pass through the plasma sheet;:\'*".\n\n, Principal Investigator Group/Other Publications\nG7-02\n\nFrank, L.A., "Several Comments Concerning a Recently Proposed\nMagnetospheric Model," University of Iowa, UI 70^57, Nov., 1970.\n\nG7-03\n\nFrank, L.A., "S.U.I.
