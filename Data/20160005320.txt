As RPS have evolved throughout the years,\nthere has also grown a desire for more efficient power systems,\nallowing NASA to serve as good stewards of the limited\nplutonium-238 (238Pu), while also supporting the ever-present\nneed to minimize mass and potential impacts to the desired\nscience measurements. In fact, the recent Nuclear Power\nAssessment Study (NPAS) released in April 2015 resulted in\nseveral key conclusion regarding RPS, including affirmation\nthat RPS will be necessary well into the 2030s (at least) and\nthat 238Pu is indeed a precious resource requiring efficient\nutilization and preservation.\nStirling Radioisotope Generators (SRGs) combine a Stirling\ncycle engine powered by a radioisotope heater unit into a single\ngenerator system. Stirling engine technology has been under\ndevelopment at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in\npartnership with the Department of Energy (DOE) since the\n1970\xe2\x80\x99s. The most recent design, the 238Pu-fueled Advanced\nStirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), was offered as part\nof the NASA Discovery 2010 Announcement of Opportunity\n(AO). The Step-2 selections for this AO included two ASRGenabled concepts, the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) and the\nComet Hopper (CHopper), although the only non-nuclear\nconcept, InSight, was ultimately chosen. The DOE\xe2\x80\x99s ASRG\ncontract was terminated in 2013. Given that SRGs utilize\nsignificantly less 238Pu than traditional Radioisotope\nThermoelectric Generators (RTGs) \xe2\x80\x93 approximately one\nquarter of the nuclear fuel, to produce similar electrical power\noutput \xe2\x80\x93 they provide a technology worthy of consideration for\nmeeting the aforementioned NASA objectives.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s RPS Program Office has recently investigated a new\nStirling to Flight (S2F) initiative with the objective of\ndeveloping a 100-500 We Stirling generator system.\nAdditionally, a different approach is being devised for this\ninitiative to avoid pitfalls of the past, and apply lessons learned\nfrom the recent ASRG experience. Two key aspects of this\ninitiative are a Stirling System Technology Maturation Effort,\nand a Surrogate Mission Team (SMT) intended to provide\nclear mission pull and requirements context. The S2F project\nseeks to lead directly into a DOE flight system development of\na new SRG. This paper will detail the proposed S2F initiative,\nand provide specifics on the key efforts designed to pave a\nforward path for bringing Stirling technology to flight.\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nA recent Nuclear Power Assessment Study (NPAS) [1] was\ncompleted in 2015, under the guidance of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nRadioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Office. The\nprincipal objectives of this study were to discuss a\nsustainable strategy and examine the current capabilities for\nproviding safe, reliable, and affordable nuclear power\nsystems to enable NASA Science Mission Directorate\n(SMD) missions and their extensibility to Human\nExploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD)\nneeds over the next twenty years.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s need for RPS to enable robotic scientific missions\nfor planetary exploration has been a \xe2\x80\x9cgiven\xe2\x80\x9d for over four\ndecades, and continues to remain an ongoing need based on\nthe findings of the most recent Planetary Decadal Survey of\n2011, \xe2\x80\x9cVision and Voyages\xe2\x80\x9d [2]. NPAS goes on to\nconclude that this need resides primarily within planetary\nscience, with a few potential exceptions that support\nHeliophysics Science Division, such as the Interstellar\nProbe concept contained within the Heliophysics Decadal\nSurvey of 2013: \xe2\x80\x9cSolar and Space Physics: A Science for a\nTechnological Society\xe2\x80\x9d [3]. This need for planetary science\nis expected to continue well into the 2030\xe2\x80\x99s, most likely\nlonger.\n\n1\n\nWhile future human missions, such as a surface mission to\nMars, will likely require some form of nuclear power, these\nefforts are forecast to need 35 to 40 kWe which is not\nreasonable with current, or envisioned, RPS technology.\nThe HEOMD missions are likely to call for fission-based\nnuclear power systems that rely on enriched 235U rather than\n238\nPu. There may be some commonality in the technologies\nused, such as within Stirling converters, but is considered\nbeyond the scope of the current proposed charter for a SRG\ndevelopment activity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAny new system should also be designed to be modular,\nallowing for the use of 1-4 generators per mission\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe SRG should limit waste heat (i.e., target ~500 Wth\nper unit) that could negatively impact key science\nmeasurements being made\n\nAdditionally, the S2F initiative seeks to invoke lessons\nlearned from the previous Advanced Stirling Radioisotope\nGenerator (ASRG) efforts, with greater consideration for\nrobustness, manufacturing, and reliability.\n\nLastly, the NPAS report concluded that single planetary\nscience mission power requirements are unlikely to exceed\n~600 We, and that this required power level is more\nefficiently fulfilled with an RPS than a fission power system\n(FPS). For future RPS-powered missions to utilize greater\nelectrical power than today (~110-125 W per generator)\nrequires increased 238Pu production and/or flight\nqualification of higher efficiency converters, for example\nthermoelectric enhanced multi-mission radioisotope thermal\ngenerator (eMMRTG) and/or dynamic Stirling converters.\n\nConsidering the first objective, one immediately seeks\nclarification on exactly what is meant by \xe2\x80\x9crobust,\nmanufacturable, and reliable with reasonable life-cycle and\nsustainability costs.\xe2\x80\x9d These terms need to be clearly defined\nand quantified into requirements that will drive the system\ndesign. Defining these requirements is part of the tasks in\nthe early S2F development phases.\nAnother key objective of the S2F effort is to actually\ndemonstrate the technology in flight. To this end, the team\nis focusing on the first flight of a Stirling converter, keeping\nthe expectations and requirements on this technology\nmodest. It is anticipated that there will be SRG design\nevolutions for future flights beyond the initial one, that can\nbuild upon the \xe2\x80\x9cto-be proven\xe2\x80\x9d technology, focusing on\ntypical engineering enhancements. Therefore, the initial\nSRG is only seeking to provide 100-500 We, and does not\n\nThe new Stirling to Flight (S2F) initiative seeks to address\nseveral of the key NPAS findings, specifically targeting the\nneeds of planetary, robotic exploration missions through the\n2030s. It hopes to initially produce an SRG with roughly\nequivalent electrical output using less 238Pu than today\xe2\x80\x99s\nflight-ready systems by employing dynamic Stirling\nconverter technology. One of the principal lessons from\npast efforts is to execute the S2F as a flight system\ndevelopment project, rather than as a technology\ndevelopment effort, driving the design and testing of a\nsystem to be used in flight. It is really the integration of two\nmajor efforts that culminate in a DOE contract for a SRG\nflight system development project. These two focus areas\nare 1) establishment of a Surrogate Mission Team (SMT)\nthat provides clear mission pull and requirements context, as\ndescribed in Section 4 below, and 2) a Stirling technology\nmaturation effort, detailed in Section 5, both supported by\nRisk Informed Lifetime Modeling described in Section 6.\n\n2. S2F OBJECTIVES\nThe new S2F initiative was drafted in Spring 2015. The\nobjectives of the S2F initiative are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelop a 100-500 We Stirling generator RPS for\nintegration onto a mission launch opportunity no earlier\nthan 2028 that is robust, manufacturable, and reliable\n(fault-tolerant, long-life) with reasonable life-cycle and\nsustainability costs\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe final version of this system should produce higherpower output per volume of 238Pu consumed compared\nto current RPS such as the MMRTG (e.g., ~125 We\nBOL using only 2 GPHS vice the MMRTG\xe2\x80\x99s 8 GPHS)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThis SRG should be constrained to a reasonable mass,\n< 50 kg per unit, and seek to be as mass efficient as\npossible\n\nFigure 1. Technology selection and process to flight builds\nupon successful MMRTG implementation.\n2\n\nhave a requirement to maximize efficiency but rather to\nfocus on converter technology that is reliable, predictable,\nand repeatable.\n\nmembership\nconsistent\nwith\nNASA\nProcedural\nRequirements 7123 (or DOE equivalent), and the top-level\nintegrated budget and schedule.\n\n3. S2F APPROACH\n\nFundamentally, as its name suggests, the SMT functions as\na surrogate flight mission team until NASA selects an actual\nflight mission, and serves as the requirements and technical\nauthority during S2F. This team includes leadership from\nthe NASA RPS Office and the DOE, power systems\nexpertise from Glenn Research Center (GRC), and\nrepresentatives from each of the major robotic mission flight\nimplementers utilized by NASA, specifically the Johns\nHopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL\nor APL), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Additional details on\nthe SMT are provided in Section 4 below.\n\nThe S2F approach is to build upon successful technology\nmaturation methodologies from the past, especially those\ninvolving interactions with the Department of Energy\n(DOE) on nuclear powered systems. Specifically, S2F\nintends to leverage the MMRTG and eMMRTG technology\nMaturation Operational and Evaluation Model as shown in\nFigure 1.\nThe S2F initiative is envisioned to employ a four-phase\nimplementation approach, as shown in Figure 2. Phase 1,\nPreparation and Discovery, focuses on the establishment of\nboth a Management Team (MT) and the Surrogate Mission\nTeam (SMT), releasing a Stirling RFI and analyzing the\nresults, initial S2F requirements development, and\nidentification of the acquisition strategy.\n\nThe Preparation and Discovery Phase proceeds to gather\ninformation, scope out requirements, and identify the\nacquisition strategy. NASA released an RFI in 2015 to\nassess Stirling technology options available and how they\ncan be incorporated into the desired space qualified power\nsystem. The goal was to understand Stirling industrial\nsuppliers and their demonstrated capabilities (including\nprecision flight hardware manufacturing ability), for both\nconverter providers and system integrators; potential\npartnership approaches between different organizations\nwere also identified. The RFI sought information on SRG\nderivative and scalability potential, as well as an\nunderstanding of any intellectual property concerns and\npotential licensing opportunities. The responses were\nanalyzed and assessed by a joint NASA-DOE review team,\na subset of which traveled to the various vendor locations\n\nThe MT oversees both the Stirling technology development\nand the SMT. The MT will ensure and facilitate\ncoordination between the NASA and DOE agencies, and\nacross all of the RPS program elements. This team consists\nof program managers from RPS and DOE, the RPS Program\nPlanning and Assessment Manager, the Stirling Cycle\nTechnology Development Project Manager, and both the\nNASA and DOE contract officers. The major products that\nthis team is responsible for include the Stirling request for\ninformation (RFI), the S2F acquisition strategy, InterAgency Agreements (IAA), gate review criteria and board\n\nFigure 2. The S2F phased development fosters technology development driven by flight mission centers\xe2\x80\x99 needs and\nconcerns, targeting a New Frontiers class mission with a potential launch in ~2028.\n3\n\nfor targeted, more in-depth investigation.\n\nspecified Stirling converter provider as determined during\nthe previous phase. There may also be an Integrated\nSystems Engineering Team (ISET) formed to guide and\nadvise the SRG development. This ISET is expected to\nconsist of both the SMT and a systems engineering team\nfrom the contractors, along with any independent technical\nexperts that may be deemed necessary for success by the\nMT. The ISET utilizes the SMT to provide the mission endusers\xe2\x80\x99 perspective, and mission pull, as the SRG moves\nthrough development, and the inevitable design evolution as\nthe technology is matured. This intent is to maximize the\ndesign space the contractors have to work with, while\nensuring all of the mission requirements are met or\nnegotiated to facilitate technical readiness, robustness, and\nreliability. The ISET and MT will hold internal project\nreviews to help ensure success, or to suggest corrective\nactions when necessary prior to the formal gate reviews.\nNote, it is possible that the ISET could also be created in the\nprevious phase to help define the SRG and its development\nplan, but would need to be done in a manner that does not\nrestrict potential respondents to the DOE RFP process.\n\nAn initial set of requirements is being defined by the SMT\nusing a traditional systems engineering process, working\nfrom a mission context that includes as many potential\nSRG-enabled missions as realistic, defining mission-level\nrequirements, and working down to flight-system,\nsubsystem, and (if appropriate) unit-level requirements. A\nnotional concept of operations is being derived in parallel\nwith the context missions and the initial requirements set.\nTo date, all of the milestones identified in the Preparation\nand Discovery Phase have been achieved as scheduled. The\ndetails of how S2F will advance into the Smart Buyer Phase\nremain in negotiations with NASA Headquarters, with its\nnotional start at least six months into the future at the time\nof this paper.\nPhase 2, Smart Buyer, is intended to ensure that the best\navailable Stirling technologies are evaluated and selected to\nultimately move into development and flight fabrication.\nThe S2F initiative realizes that the true technology\ndevelopment effort is contained within the Stirling\nconverter. During this period, it is anticipated that several\ndifferent converters will be tested, with multiple providers\npossibly receiving funding to provide engineering or\ndemonstration test units. Think of Phase 2 as a test-drive for\nthe Stirling converters where different drivers get a chance\nto kick the tires and decide which models they are favoring.\nThis phase will include a technology readiness assessment\nas a gate review by the government. In addition, during this\nphase the MT will finalize the SRG acquisition strategy, and\nthe DOE should release a draft Request for Proposal (RFP)\nthat addresses both converter providers and SRG system\nintegrators. The SMT will work to update the mission and\nsystem requirements that will flow down to the DOE to\ndrive their RFP. The Smart Buyer phase concludes with the\nDOE awarding a Stirling technology maturation system\ncontract to specifically develop the next SRG.\n\nThe fourth and final phase is the actual SRG flight system\nfabrication and delivery. This is when the DOE-contracted\nSRG provider takes the system design proven by the\nengineering and qualification units and produces the final\nflight hardware that will be delivered to NASA for use on a\nflight mission. It is expected that this phase will be in\nparallel to a New Frontiers class competitive AO from\nNASA, and timed so that the final SRG is delivered to\nKennedy Space Center in time for the flight mission\xe2\x80\x99s\nintegration and test flow requirements.\n\n4. SURROGATE MISSION TEAM (SMT)\nThe SMT was formed at the start of the S2F initiative and\nprovides flight mission perspective, involvement, and\ncontinuity throughout the various phases described earlier;\nthe SMT empowers the S2F initiative to be executed as a\n\xe2\x80\x9cflight\xe2\x80\x9d development rather than as a pure technology\nendeavor. The SMT serves as the requirements technical\nauthority during S2F. Once an actual mission is awarded in\nthe final flight hardware delivery phase, the SMT will\ntransition their products and knowledge to that actual\nmission team. From that point forward, it is expected that\ncontinued efforts will focus exclusively on the\nimplementation and execution of the chosen flight project.\nSMT personnel will most likely continue to support the RPS\nProgram Office as SRG Integration Lead and consultants, in\nmuch the same manner that JPL personnel have done with\nRTGs in the past.\n\nThe third phase will mature and develop the SRG. This\nphase is envisioned to provide greater than five years for a\ntypical complex system design, fabrication, and verification\nprocess. This phase focuses on SRG development moving\nthrough the tradition formal implementation gates including\nSystems Requirements Review (SRR)/System Design\nReview (SDR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and a\nFinal Design Review (FDR); refer to Figure 2 for relative\ntiming. Prior to the FDR, an SRG engineering unit must be\nprovided and fully tested (exact test definition and success\ncriteria are TBD at present) as another formal gate. To\nestablish confidence in SRG availability with potential\nusers, it is strongly recommended that the FDR must be\nsuccessfully completed prior to NASA offering an SRG in\nany future AOs. The SRG maturation and development\nphase ends once a fueled qualification unit has successfully\ngone through system validation.\n\nCore to this approach is the formation of a crossorganizational team, with all of the key stakeholders and\nagency leadership engaged. This team includes leadership\nfrom the RPS Program Office and from the DOE due to the\nnuclear fuel used to provide the input heat that drives power\ngeneration. GRC is involved as the lead center for NASA\npower systems technology development. Applying a lesson\nlearned from the ASRG project, the leading NASA mission\n\nThe DOE will hold the contract for a Stirling generator\nprovider/integrator, who may subcontract to a government4\n\nimplementation centers of the APL, JPL, and GSFC are all\nkey participants. Inclusion of the mission centers is an\nessential component, as these organizations provide the\nnecessary mission pull and end-user perspective, and\ncontext, needed for S2F to be successful.\nThese\norganizations also carry forth their expertise in bringing\nsystems successfully to flight, and by having all three\ninvolved, ensure that the developed system is appropriately\ndefined, matured, and will meet mission requirements;\nworking to get buy-in from all three of the mission centers\nfosters development of a suitable system that will meet\nflight mission needs within acceptable risk.\n\nat Sunpower Inc., shown in Figure 3. The ASC development\nhas produced a total of 29 converters with over 400,000\nhours of cumulative operation at GRC.\nThe ASC-E3 effort has resulted in eight converters, with the\nlatter four units built using flight-approved processes and\nassembled in a Sunpower cleanroom. All but the last unit\nhave been delivered to GRC for independent testing and\nverification.\nThe first two units (#1 and #2) were operated at GRC as\nstand-alone units for extended performance mapping\n(approximately 3500 hrs.) and then integrated into the\nEngineering Unit #2 (EU2) system, shown in Figure 4. The\nEU2 test ended prematurely in January 2015 due to\nconverter power fluctuations.\nThe investigation to\ndetermine root cause is still on-going with four leading\ntheories: 1) internal collisions of moving parts, 2) adverse\ninteractions from the pulse-width-modulated electrical\ncontroller, 3) insufficient running clearances on moving\ncomponents, and 4) excessive forces imparted on converters\nfrom the external housing structure. Recommendations are\nbeing prepared by the investigation team to update\nprocesses and/or revise the design to avoid these issues.\n\nThe SMT\xe2\x80\x99s principal charter is to ensure that mission\nrequirements, trades, and risks are completely integrated\nthroughout the S2F technology development and\nmaturation. Their key functions are essential to success of\nthe early S2F initiative phases when their major deliverables\nare generated. The primary deliverables from the SMT\ninclude a System Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) to\nguide its implementation, a mission needs statement to\nsupport the DOE\xe2\x80\x99s processes for interacting with NASA,\nmission context (i.e., design reference mission), concept of\noperations, and S2F requirements. The SMT also oversees\nthe definition and implementation of the risk informed\nlifetime testing and modeling activities, as detailed in\nSection 5.\nThe SMT will provide risk management and mitigation\nsupport throughout the SRG initiative, bringing forth the\nunique perspective that only a flight mission implementer,\nand final SRG end-user, can provide. The risk management\napproach is consistent with existing process at the mission\nimplementation centers, and compliant with NASA\nProcedural Requirements 8000.4.\n\nFigure 4. EU2 Generator Housing Assembly\n\n5. STIRLING TECHNOLOGY MATURATION AND\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nOne E3 converter (#7) experienced operational issues during\nproduction before it was delivered to GRC. The unit was\nfound to have significant internal fiber debris from an\nimproperly installed regenerator that disrupted operation.\nRegenerator debris can present a problem in piston gap\nclearances and at the internal gas bearing check valve. The\n#7 converter was eventually scrapped allowing detailed\nsectioning of the components to determine root cause. As a\nresult, Sunpower was directed to produce E3 #9, planned for\ndelivery in December 2015. The investigation resulted in a\nminor design change to the regenerator, and revised\nprocedures for installation. Future designs that eliminate\ndebris or increase the converter\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance to debris would\nbe beneficial.\n\nThe previous effort to develop the ASRG is well\ndocumented with references to system design [4], system\ntesting [5], and Stirling converter maturation [6]. After the\nASRG flight contract was terminated in 2013, GRC\ncontinued development of the final engineering model\nAdvanced Stirling Converters (ASCs; designated ASC-E3)\n\nThe other E3 converters are still being tested at GRC with\nthe goal of subjecting the converters to a typical mission\nlifecycle. The first step after delivery of the converters from\nSunpower is to map their performance against the design\nspecification. Testing is performed on individual units\nusing an electrical heat source simulating the 238Pu General\n\nFigure 3. ASC-E3\n5\n\nPurpose Heat Source (GPHS) module. The mapping\nincludes steady-state operation at seven distinct operating\nconditions varying heat input, acceptor temperature, and\nrejection temperature.\nAfterwards, the converters are\nprocessed under conditions simulating the major phases of a\nflight mission including system integration/fueling (where\nthe two Stirling converters are installed as a dual, opposed\nassembly), dynamic launch environments (where the\noperating units are subjected to launch vibrations), and longduration mission cruise (where the units are operated 24/7\nfor extended duration).\n\nhigh temperature magnets was built and operated, while\ntesting continued on high temperature organic materials for\nuse in the converter. The elevated alternator temperature\nenables Venus flyby maneuvers as well as lunar and Mars\noperation at the maximum sink temperature. To improve\nheat rejection and enable scaling to higher power, a flat\nplate heat pipe was developed as a direct replacement for\nthe ASRG cold side adapter flange. In July 2015, its\nperformance was demonstrated under both hyper-g and\nmicro-g environments on a Black Brant IX sounding rocket.\nOther tasks in process under the low TRL research effort\ninclude dynamic balancers to allow single converters to\noperate with low vibration, and an alternative electrical\ncontroller, developed by APL, with improved fault\nmanagement. The APL controller was coupled with a pair\nof early model ASCs at GRC\xe2\x80\x99s RPS System Integration Lab\nin September 2014 to demonstrate stable operation with a\nspacecraft bus and representative electrical loads [9].\n\nPrior to the ASC, NASA and DOE were developing the\nSRG-110 which used Technology Demonstration\nConverters (TDC) built by Infinia Corporation [7]. These\nunits use internal flexure bearings, rather than the\nhydrostatic gas bearings used in ASCs. A total of 16 TDCs\nwere produced in the late 1990s and early 2000s with 4\nunits, shown in Figure 5, still in 24/7 operation at GRC with\none pair at 84,000 hours and the other at 95,000 hours of run\ntime.\n\nThe Stirling development activities at GRC have been\nreformulated under the new Stirling Cycle Technology\nDevelopment Project with the goal of continuing work on\nsystems, converters, controllers, testing, and research. The\nRPS Program recently released an industry Request for\nInformation (RFI) seeking new approaches for Stirling\ntechnology, as described in Section 3 above. The objective\nis to identify robust and reliable Stirling converter designs\nthat deliver high efficiency, low mass, simple operation and\nlong life (without maintenance) for deep-space missions\nlasting 10 years or more. Ideally, this process will yield\ncompeting converter options that can be matured in parallel\nprior to a system RFP by DOE.\n\nFigure 5. TDC Test Stands at GRC\n\n6. RISK INFORMED LIFETIME MODELING AND\nTESTING\n\nIn parallel with the ASRG flight system development, lower\ntechnology readiness level (TRL) research was also being\nperformed at GRC [8]. The low TRL research focused on\nadvanced\ncomponents\nand\nalternative\nsystem\nimplementation approaches. These technologies are\ncandidates for inclusion in the next SRG should their\ndevelopment continue to a successful conclusion. At the\nStirling hot-end, research was performed to improve the\nthermal insulation and identify possible methods to divert\nthe GPHS heat from the converters to allow shutdown and\nrestart after fueling. A multi-layer insulation (MLI) package\nwas built and tested with a Stirling thermal mockup\ndemonstrating a lower mass, higher efficiency alternative to\nthe bulk, solid insulation used in ASRG. To demonstrate\nbackup heat source cooling, a variable conductance heat\npipe was integrated with an operating Stirling converter and\nan electric heat source. A test, performed in May 2015,\nverified that the heat pipe could automatically redirect the\nheat to a high temperature radiator during Stirling converter\nstoppages without violating temperature limits. Once the\nStirling converter was restarted, the heat pipe automatically\nrestored heat flow to the converter.\n\nA critical success factor in meeting the goals of the S2F\nInitiative is demonstrating the viability of the RPS\ntechnology and its likelihood of performing as expected for\nas long as needed. Reliability estimation is part of the\napproach for lifetime analysis; however traditional\nreliability analysis for lifetime prediction has inherent\nchallenges that complicate the process especially for\nsystems with relatively long lifetime requirements.\nThe dilemma for demonstrating reliability or service life for\nitems that must last a long time (perhaps over a decade) is\nthat the testing is expensive, time consuming, must satisfy\nmultiple sets of expectations, and address a variety of\nrequirements simultaneously. Although frequently used as\ndecision tools for planning and designing system test\ncampaigns, traditional statistical methods for sample size\ndetermination and test duration simply do not yield results\nwith enough confidence to adequately reduce the technology\nmaturation risk associated with RPS solutions with long\nlifetime requirements. For example, if a program requires a\nreliability of 0.90 at 15 years (130,000 hours) with a\nconfidence of 90%, the number of hours needed for\ndemonstration with no failures is 2.9 million hours using\nsample theory with an exponential distribution assumption\n\nAt the Stirling cold-end, research was performed to extend\nthe upper temperature range of the Stirling alternator, and\nreplace the conductive heat rejection interface with a\ntitanium-water heat pipe. A modified ASC alternator using\n6\n\n[10]. Even turning to state-of-the-art Bayesian methods such\nas the WeiBayes Zero-Failure formula [11] yields 1.2\nmillion hours of testing. These hours increase tremendously\nif failures have to be taken into account.\nTo balance the challenge of time and resource limitations, a\nRisk-informed Life Testing approach has been adopted for\nguiding the testing and risk-reduction activities envisioned\nfor the S2F Initiative. Rather than focus exclusively on how\nto demonstrate compliance with reliability requirements, the\nRisk Informed Life Testing process [12] addresses\nintegrating test and performance data of heritage\ncomponents and physics-of-failure models for new\ntechnology into a comprehensive framework. The result of\nthe process includes reduction of uncertainty of the results\nthrough targeted testing of limited data components and a\nframework for using data from all relevant sources.\n\nFigure 7. Risk Informed Test Planning Process\nproperties, for example, are characterized through\nlaboratory testing and their physical properties used to\npredict performance over the operating years imposed on\nthe project. If the end of life performance margins are at\nleast as large as those quantified for the previous missions\nand the confidence in these margins is at least as great as the\nconfidence in the previous margin estimates (see Figure 6),\nthen the new technology will have the same probability and\nconfidence that it will complete its mission successfully.\n\nPart of the Risk-informed Life Test process is a thorough\nreview of existing heritage SRG reliability, physics-offailure, and lifetime models in addition to the performance\nand test evidence collected to support such models. With an\nunderstanding of the reliability and lifetime implications for\na new Stirling technology concept, the following steps are to\nbe implemented:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nThrough this integrated analysis and testing process the\nprogram indicates to the community the confidence it has in\nmeeting lifetime and reliability goals, taking the form of a\nprobability or margin. The analysis examines the system for\nall potential threats to not meeting the performance\nrequirements for the period specified. As illustrated in\nFigure 7, the testing supports the analysis in an iterative\nmanner to reduce the uncertainties. Life metrics are\ncomputed along with the confidence in those metrics.\n\nEstablish the system lifetime goal\nDevelop physics-based models to analyze the system\nand determine the probability of meeting that goal and\nthe associated uncertainty or margin\nIdentify data needed to support models and determine\nsources for data: in-house, system heritage, or new\ntesting\nAnalyze data and update probability predictions\n\nWithin NASA programs, lifetime demonstration also\ninvolves testing for many hours. In contrast, the Riskinformed Life Test framework views testing as a targeted\nopportunity to reduce uncertainty in life models. While most\nperformance attributes or parameters such as temperature,\nspeed, voltage, or material strength contain deterministic\ncharacteristics, verification by analysis must play a key role\nwhen assessing systems with long mission times. The idea is\nto develop high confidence in these models instead of a life\ntest that is equivalent to decades of operation. Material\n\nThe concept SRG system is decomposed into subsystems\nand components and logic developed as a risk prediction\nmodel. Failure modes, failure mechanisms, tight margins,\nand environmental interactions are all identified which can\npotentially cause failure. A variety of reliability engineering\nmethods will be used, including, but not limited to: Failure\nMode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Worse-Case Analysis,\nor Physics of Failure analysis. The results are combined into\nthe risk model where the postulation of failure scenarios is\nformed. Data is gathered from a variety of sources (previous\nflight programs, similar systems, industry databases, test\nresults, and engineering judgment). All available data is\nused (although some are more relevant than others) to fully\ndevelop the understanding of the system. The models are\nthen exercised to identify the significant risk events and to\ndetermine the probability of meeting the life requirement.\nFigure 8 shows the realization (top box) that the SRG\nsystem is a mixture of \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d technologies with a particular\nusage history and \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d technologies with perhaps only a\ntest history. A risk model ties all subsystems together in a\nframework that models the failure behavior of the system.\nTests are designed to exercise elements of the system where\nthere is limited understanding or relevant heritage data.\n\nFigure 6. The Probabilistic Nature of Margins\n7\n\nUsing risk informed processes to demonstrate compliance\nwith life requirements (e.g., demonstrating a certain\nreliability will be achieved with a specified level of\nconfidence) is a useful technique for minimizing resources\n(e.g., budget and schedule) needed for developing new\ntechnologies. Moreover, using risk informed processes to\nestablish life requirements, by directly trading reliability,\nconfidence, and technology performance with resources,\nenhances the ability of projects and stakeholders to develop\nlife requirements compatible with expectations and resource\nconstraints\n\n7. CONCLUSION\nThe S2F initiative seeks to provide the roadmap and\nframework for the development of an SRG for use in future\nplanetary science space missions. This effort has been\nscoped to focus on the first flight SRG units, concentrating\non maturing the technology, and assuming subsequent\ndesign iterations will serve to optimize and improve\nperformance. This effort looks to build upon past programs,\nsuch as the SRG-110 and ASRG, and incorporate lessons\nlearned while targeting a no-earlier-than 2028 launch\nopportunity.\n\nFigure 8. Process Implementation Example\nThese tests are targeted to better define the failure models\nand improve the quality of the data supporting the models.\nThis test definition and design approach changes the\nparadigm from testing a system for many hours to show\nconfidence in the lifetime, to increasing confidence in the\nunderstanding of how the system is likely to fail at end of\nlife. The resultant test data is incorporated into the models\nfor the concept SRG. In the parlance of Bayesian analysis,\nthe models are updated to reflect the effect of observed\nrelevant evidence. From these results the design can change\nto accommodate and mitigate the failure modes.\n\nOne of the principal lessons is to execute the S2F effort as a\nflight system development project, rather than as a\ntechnology development effort, driving the design and\ntesting of a system to be used in flight. Core to this\nundertaking is the use of the SMT to provide mission pull,\nend-user perspective, and an honest level of buy-in from the\nprimary NASA robotic mission implementation centers.\n\nMulti-level data will be used as input into a system risk\nmodel (fault tree, reliability block diagram, or PRA). The\nresultant metric for each subsystem is an estimate of the\nreliability and an uncertainty distribution, built on relevant\ninformation available on the subsystem. An estimate of the\nprobability of failure is made and becomes the system level\nprior, meaning the initial estimated distribution. System\nlevel testing is then designed and implemented (within cost\nand schedule constraints) with the results being the evidence\nneeded to update the System Risk Model. The result is the\nprobability of meeting the life requirement with a measure\nof the confidence in that metric. As more time and data are\ngathered, the credibility of the metrics shifts accordingly.\nInstead of defining a large test program and making no\nstatements about its reliability until the test program is\ncompleted, in this scheme, the confidence is based on\nperformance data, test data, and analysis.\n\nAll of the recent testing and evaluations from past Stirling\nprograms, combined with current assessments of potential\nproviders, will be incorporated into a smart-buyer approach\nto attack the real technology risk area, specifically the\nStirling converters. S2F looks to reduce the risk and mature\nthese converters prior to engaging a system integrator that\nwill, under contract to the DOE, develop the eventual SRG\nsystem.\nAnother primary objective of the S2F Initiative is to utilize\nrisk informed lifetime modeling and testing to demonstrate\ncompliance with life requirements while balancing time and\nresource allocations. These techniques can help solve the\nchallenges of verifying performance and reliability for longlife (>10 years) components without necessitating equally\nlong-lived prelaunch testing in simulated environments, and\nprovide inputs for improved decision making throughout the\ndevelopment process.\n\nSince, the data variability and model uncertainty is inherent\nin the updated models, the confidence about the probability\ncan also be calculated. In addition, this quantitative\napproach allows the designers to see the sensitivity (and\ntherefore cost-benefit) of performing certain tests or\nmodifying design elements or materials.\n\n8\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSAE Publications, Warrendale, PA, 1993, pp. 6-1 - 6-23\n\n[1] R.L.
