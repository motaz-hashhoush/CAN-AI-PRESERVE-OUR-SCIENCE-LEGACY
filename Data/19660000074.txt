The\nmachined surface of the boss must be normal and\nconcentric in relation to the threads.\nIf the boss has to be reworked, an unusual amount\nof time and care are required to remachine and retain\nperfect threads. The reworking process results in\nmany bosses being scrapped or replaced.\nThe solution:\nA threaded pilot that is used to align cutting surfaces with the boss threads. This allows machining to\nbe done after threading, and insures precision alignment.\nHow it's done:\nAfter the boss is drilled and threaded, a threaded\npilot is screwed into the boss and a cutting tool that\nfits over the threaded pilot shaft is used to machine\nthe boss surfaces. The use of the threaded pilot\nkeeps the machined surfaces normal and concentric\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

For reworking a boss, the threaded\npilot is screwed in, and the surfaces are machined in\nthe same manner as that used for the original work.\nNotes:\n1. This device is recommended for use wherever precise alignment of port threads and boss face is\nrequired.\n2.
