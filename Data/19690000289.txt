By\nuse of this device, a microwave transmitter may re- \t\n\t\nmain at full power, hence, preserving the bandwidth\nand modulation characteristics, and proportion any \t\namount of the full power from the normal antenna into\t\na dissipative load.\t\n\t\nThe divider consists of four elements: a transducer\n\t\nwhich changes the polarization from rectangular to\n\n\t\n\nin Figure I. The power into the mode change section\nfrom the TE 10 mode in the rectangular waveguide to\nthe TE 11 mode in the circular waveguide is converted to TE 11 circular polarization by the first\nquarter wave plate. By rotating the second quarter\nwave plate with respect to the first, rotatable linear\npolarization is obtained at the output of the second\nquarter wave plate which is connected to the fixed\n(relative to input) orthomode transducer. The power\ninto each port is a function of the polarization angle of\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The\nmode is changed to the TE 11 circular polarization in\nthe mode change section and the first quarter wave\nplate. This is shown in Figure 2B. The circular polarization is changed to rotatable linear polarization by\nmeans of the second quarter wave plate and is rotatable through 360 degrees. This input to the orthomode\ntransducer is shown in Figure 2C. The amount of\npower distributed to load I or load 2 depends upon\nthe angle 0 setting of the second quarter wave plate.\nThe power into load 1 (P2) is:\nP2 = P i, put Cos 2 0\nThe power into load 1 (P1) is:\nP1 = Pinput Sin 2 0\n\nTherefore, the attenuation from input to Port 2 is:\n\nAttenuation is a function only of the rotation angle\nand could be remotely read and controlled.\n\nNote:\n\n.\n\n1.
