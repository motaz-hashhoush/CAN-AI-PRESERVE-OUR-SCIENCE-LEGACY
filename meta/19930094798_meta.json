The greatest economy usually coincides with the best aerodynamic and static conditions and the cost is always increased by safety requirements.", "title": "Relative Economy of Different Methods of Airplane Construction", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930094798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Herrmann, H"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "28e1eb53585247caac55f7a9e074e331"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-07-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930094798, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930094798, "id": "8907082634be45fda2ac70b3b2449b45", "publicationDate": "1931-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930094798.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930094798/downloads/19930094798.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930094798/downloads/19930094798.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930094798/downloads/19930094798.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
