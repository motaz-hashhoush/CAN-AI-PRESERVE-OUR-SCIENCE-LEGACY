b'COMMERCIAL\n\nSPACE SERVICES\n\nDavid L. Christensen\nWyle Laboratories\nHuntsville, Alabama 35807\n\nABSTRACT\nThis poster paper provides an overview of space service opportunities as identified by a\nWyle Laboratories\xe2\x80\x99 research team. This effort is funded by the NASA Commercial Task Force\nto support policy and planning efforts of the government and to accelerate transition of space\noperations to the private sector. A better understanding of potential commercial opportunities\nfor space services is needed to aid in the promotion and implementation of new private enterprises as encouraged by current administration policy.\nThrough the use of a baseline space scenario, a variety of space hardware, services, and\ncommercial activities are identified and related on a time-phased basis. A model is presented to\nrelate the potential functions of government and the private sector in a commercialized space\nenvironment during the period 1984 to 2004. Barriers, incentives and key issues are likewise\nidentified and addressed to aid in the implementation of private sector activities for spacerelated programs. Broader awareness, legislative actions, incentive development and benefit\nanalyses are considered in the presentation. The time-phased plan developed as the final product of the study contract provides a useful planning and management tool, allows broader\ncommunication, and supports overall space commercialization program assessment.\n\nDISCUSSION\nWyle was recently awarded a new contract by NASA Headquarters to support the NASA\nCommercialization Task Force. The Wyle team, consisting of personnel from Huntsville, Hamp\nton, and El Segundo has supported the development of the new policy and position papers\nneeded to stimulate expanded commercial activities in space programs.\nCommercial opportunities in space encompass involvement of the private sector for\nproducts and services derived in the space environment and for support services to space\nendeavors. Potentially profitable enterprises related to:\nl\n\nEarth and ocean observations\n\n0 Communications\nl\nl\n\n272\n\nMaterials processing\nIndustrial and special commercial services.\n\nTo achieve private sector investment in, ownership of, and operation of various activities\nas a profit-making venture, certain NASA initiatives must be undertaken to stimulate and support\nprivate sector involvement. Wyle is helping NASA to identify and implement those new\ninitiatives and communication methods.\nThe long-term development and use of space will require the continuing application of a\nlarge array of equipment, facilities, and operational processes. Not only will new opportunities\narise for the development and commercialization of new products as a result of the special\nenvironment afforded by space, but likewise, many new service-related opportunities can now be\nanticipated. The Wyle team is supporting NASA by identifying potential space services required\nto support a broad variety of public, private and military space endeavors now in planning and\ndevelopment.\nCommercial space services in support of space applications, technology development,\nmilitary and industrial activities are anticipated for a broad range of activities, both ground and\nin-space related. Wyle has identified numerous service functions. In addition, related services\nand desirable government incentives, and actions needed to accelerate the commercialization\nprocess have been identified and addressed in the Wyle study program.\nTo aid in the study, a model was developed by Wyle which helps to relate the potential\nfunctions of government and the private sector in a commercialized space environment. The\ntime-phased listing of potential involvement of the private sector, developed as the final product\nof the study, should provide a useful planning and management tool, allowing broader communication, and enhancing the overall assessment of the space commercialization program.\nA Fee-For-Service Laboratory attached as a module to the planned orbiting Space Station\nis envisioned to be one area where the private sector can contribute both technically and\nmaterially to NASA space commercialization efforts in general, and to private sector involvement\nin the Space Station mission in particular. This laboratory, as an example of a typical commercial space service activity, can provide an important and necessary vehicle to meet private-sector\nneeds in the commercialization of emerging technologies such as materials processing in zero\ngravity. Technical and economic assessment of a Fee-For-Service Laboratory is being proposed\nby Wyle Laboratories. This Lab will have many positive advantages for both the government\nand industry factions which it will serve.\nThe architecture of the Fee-For-Service Laboratory will evolve through detailed analysis\nof user requirements and associated equipment operation. Surveys which are now in progress\nand those completed in the past have revealed that industry has both needs and interests in\nspace-based R&D; however, there is a strong reluctance on their part to pursue the independent\ndevelopment of supporting facilities.and equipment. The Wyle Fee-For-Service Laboratory could\nprovide both the needed space-based facilities/equipment as well as trained personnel to perform\ntests and/or to generate samples in accordance with user specifications. Consideration of\nindustry needs, individually and collectively, would ensure the development of a general purpose\nlaboratory of sufficiently broad capability, to meet industry needs in an orderly rather than in a\npiece-meal fashion.\nIn addition Wyle is investigating other space concepts and ventures to support develop\nment and testing of large space structures, energy conversion and storage devices, and advanced\nmaterials needed to advance our technological base and broaden commercial operations.\n\n273\n\nIn the longer term, and projecting into the next century, the expected exploration and\nexploitation of outer space could lead to public and private enterprises of considerable scope and\nbenefit to the human race. A selection of the types of long term space endeavors now being\nidentified and assessedfor commercial potential include the following:\nl\nl\n\nGlobal Environmental Assessments (C02, Freon, Acid Rain, Etc.)\n\nl\n\nIn-Space Agriculture\n\nl\n\nTethers For Mass/Momentum Transfer\n\nl\n\nLarge Space-Based Power Systems\n\nl\n\nSpace Industrial Parks\n\nl\n\nSpace Hotels and Recreational Facilities\n\nl\n\nLunar Base Construction and Operation\n\nl\n\n274\n\nHazardous Waste Disposal in Space\n\nExtra Terrestrial Mining and Mineral Processing\n\n'
