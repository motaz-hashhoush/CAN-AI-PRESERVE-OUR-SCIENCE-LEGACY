In these areas, particular needs have arisen to which the subject of this paper is directed. In the area of obstetrics, the forceps design and function has remained relatively unchanged for a number of years. In an effort to advance the technology, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has been asked by the obstetrical community to help in a redesign of the obstetric forceps. Traditionally the forceps design has been of tubular stainless steel, constructed in two halves which interlock and hinge to provide the gripping force necessary to aid in the delivery of an infant. The stainless steel material was used to provide for ease of cleaning and sterilization. However, one of the drawbacks of the non-flexible steel design is that excessive force can be placed upon an infants head which could result in damage or injury to the infant. The redesign of this particular obstetric tool involves applying NASA's knowledge of advanced materials and state of the art instrumentation to create a tool which can be used freely throughout the obstetrics community without the fear of injury to an infant being delivered.", "title": "Composite redesign of obstetrical forceps", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940025952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lawson, Seth W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "f8927a16fc4042fab2d18daeb021348c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940025952, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smeltzer, Stan S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "78475123cda443fa95e82b16f65188d0"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940025952, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940025952, "id": "5a6ef5870b2441c1bf1f6e8e7a3375df", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2003: The Fourth National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1994-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940025124, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "The 27th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940025952.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940025952/downloads/19940025952.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940025952/downloads/19940025952.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940025952/downloads/19940025952.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
