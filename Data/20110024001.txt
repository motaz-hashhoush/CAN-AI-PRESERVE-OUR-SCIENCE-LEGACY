b'generate a force in the approximate range\nof 1 to 4 N, the exact amount depending\non operating conditions and details of design. This level of actuation force would be\ntoo low to enable the valve to handle a\nfluid at the high pressure level mentioned\nin the preceding article.\nThe proposal encompasses two alternative\ndesigns \xe2\x80\x94 one featuring a miniature piezoelectric bimorph actuator and one featuring\na thick-film unimorph piezoelectric actuator\n(see figure). In either version, the valve\nwould consume a power of only 0.01 W when\nactuated at a frequency of 100 Hz. Also, in either version, it would be necessary to attach a\nsoft elastomeric sealing ring to the valve seat\nso that any particles that settle on the seat\nwould be pushed deep into the elastomeric\nmaterial to prevent or reduce leakage.\nThe overall dimensions of the bimorph version would be 7 by 7 by 1 mm.\nThe actuator in this version would gen-\n\nerate a force of 1 N and a stroke of 10 \xc2\xb5m\nat an applied potential of 150 V. The actuation force would be sufficient to enable the valve to handle a fluid pressurized up to about 50 psi (\xe2\x89\x880.35 MPa).\nThe overall dimensions of the unimorph version would be 2 by 2 by 0.5 mm.\nIn this version, an electric field across the\npiezoelectric film on a diaphragm would\ncause the film to pull on, and thereby\nbend, the diaphragm. At an applied potential of 20 V, the actuator in this version would generate a stroke of 10 \xc2\xb5m and\na force of 0.01 N. This force level would\nbe too low to enable handling of fluids at\npressures comparable to those of the bimorph version. This version would be\nuseful primarily in microfluidic and\nnanofluidic applications that involve extremely low differential pressures and in\nwhich there are requirements for extreme miniaturization of valves. Exam-\n\nples of such applications include liquid\nchromatography and sequencing of deoxyribonucleic acid.\nThis work was done by Eui-Hyeok Yang of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Field and design\nengineers worked together to create a\nvalve that would simplify installation,\ntrim changes, and maintenance, thus reducing overall cost. The seals and plug\nstem packing were designed to perform\noptimally in cryogenic temperature\nranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can\nbe changed independent of the body.\nThe design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a split\nbody. The body is divided into an upper\nand a lower section with the seat ring\nsandwiched in between. In order to\nmaintain the plug stem packing at an\nacceptable sealing temperature during\ncryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins\nwere added to the upper body section\n(see figure).\nThe body is made of stainless steel.\nThe seat ring is made of a nickel-based\nalloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of\nthe valve is cooled cryogenically, the\nbody surrounding the seat ring contracts\nmore than the seat ring. This feature\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, December 2003\n\nprevents external leakage at the bodyseat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing\nsurfaces on both sides of the seal groove.\nThese sealing surfaces concentrate the\nbody bolt load over a small area, thereby\npreventing external leakage.\nThe design of the body bolt circle is\ndifferent from that of conventional\nhigh-pressure control valves. Half of the\nbolts clamp the split body together\nfrom the top, and half from the bottom\nside. This bolt-circle design allows a\nshort, clean flow path, which minimizes\nfrictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten\nthe face-to-face length of the valve,\nwhich is 25.5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a\nconventional, high-pressure control\nvalve face-to-face dimension may be\ngreater than 40 in. (>1 m) long.\nThis work was completed by Karlin\nWilkes, Ed Larsen, and Jackson McCourt of\nFlowserve Corporation for Stennis Space\nCenter.

The heat-exchanger fins\nhelp keep the plug stem packing warm enough\nto function at cryogenic temperatures.\n\n21\n\n'
