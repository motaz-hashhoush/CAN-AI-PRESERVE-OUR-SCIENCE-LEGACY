And. I a l s o round out that many\ncoal compa:iies have imrc than an academic\nintcrcst in : e California markL porenh\nt i t i 1 for their western cou1 reserves.\nSiiicc. t I i i s sub.ic*ct Ii;ts h e m so cxtcnsivcly\ncsxploi-ctl. I began L O wonder whar kind of\ncontribution I could make. After doing\nmore homework to learn what others have\nalready determined, it was abundantly\nclear t o me that sufficient coal reserves\nto meet California\'s needs are available\nfrom known and commercially viable coal\ndeposits in the western coal provinces and\nppssibiy from Alaska.

Indzecl.\na f t c r hcarinp, Lhe on-p,oing debate over\nCalifornia\'s future electric power generation fuel supply plans, I came to a concl.*3ionthat I could make a contribution\nL O this conference and t o the debate by\n111\n\nN19-27607\n\nstressing one simple fact. A fact s o simple. I run the risk of sounding inane.\nYet, I will take that risk to point out\nthat the existence of a otential coal\nsovrce is not enough to m h 2 i l a b l e .\nn\nThere are a number of "ifs" which m\nrecognized and dealt with before coal can\nbe shipped from a mine in the quantities\nneeded for a large base load pcwer plant.\nCoal producers are well aware of these\n"ifs\'\' -- utilities need tu know them as\nwell as their consequences. The "ifs" I\nam referring to are those inherent in the\nmine development schedule or the timetable\nrequired to open up a pine and bring it to\nits full production rate. And these "ifs"\ncan become critical matters because the\ntimetable to bring on line a large coalfired plant and the timetable to opzn a\nmine t supply the coal are nearly ideccio\ncal. Any delays in the wi-ne developnient\ntimetable mean a corresponding delay in\ngetting the mine into production. And\nthat\'s the bottom line of my message because, for many reasons it now takes essentially the same time to bring a new mine\ninto full production as it takes to put on\nline an electricity generating plant. In\nmy brief present-ation.I will point out\nSomc of thc factors which arc respotisiblc\n\xe2\x82\xacor this substantial lengthening o \xe2\x82\xac the\nmine development-timetable and discuss the\n;tssoci;tted " i f s . "\nHowcver. beforc I h ; h i : i the fluid\ni;l~It\nmilestones which arc on the critical path\ntowards routine deiiveries of coal to a\npower plant, I feel duty bound to present\na brief summary on where pqtential coal\nsupplies exis\'i. Actually, the potential\nsource list is important in itself in that\nit: makes a point fundamental t o a mine\ndevclapment schedule. The point hcinp, that\npoLcnLial coal fields have a with ranf:e of\n~ . o a Iquali t ier;, iopo1o):ic a n t 1 ~;cwIoj:ic\nconditions. 311 o f whish inCluenLc L c\nha\nmining plans. Since mine development time\nschedules are affected by these factors, a\nbrief look at the m3re promising coal\ndeposits will hizhlight t-heirdi ffcrcnces\nin these ilrciis.\n\nREPRODUCIBTTJTY OF THE\nORIGINAL PAGE IS POOR\n\n1. POTENTIAL Sddk \'S OF COAL SUPPLY\nAn extensive investigation by the coal\nsupply group in the UCLA-DWR study (Ref. 1)\nidentified and analyzed 92 coal fields\nwithin 800 miles of Los Angeles as potcntial scurces of coal. Onlv 17 of these\nfields m e t ;heir final criteria of having\nrecoverabli: reserves of 100 million tons\n(over the life of the power plant), necessary coal quality (low sulfur content),\nmineabjiity, and proximity to transportation cystems. A sunrmary of the characteristia of these 17 coal field:; is given in\nTable 1 (Ref. 2 ) . Their locations and the\nexisting railroads and pipeline network\nare shown in Figure 1 (Ref. 2. The UCLA\n)\nstudy team concluded that, on the basis\nof availability and likelihood of development, the coal fields of Central Utah,\nWyoming. and New Nexico were judged to be\nthe most promising sources. Note. sprcifically, that the Utah mines would be underground and the Wyoming and New Mexico\nmines would be surface mines. Later on in\nthis presentation, I will he discussing\nthe differences in time t o devc!op underground-versus-surface mines.\n\nIn a rermrt recently released as part\nthe National Coal I. !lL ition Assess,\nme,?t (NCUA) program, "Imp. -rs of Future\nCoai Use in California" (Ret. 3). the\nLawreyce Berkley Laboratory (LBL) study\ngroup :oncluded chat coal burned in\nCalifornia is expected to come primarily\nfrom deep mines in Utah. The coal quality assumed in the LBL assessment had a\nheat content of 12.000 Btu per pou-4. 0.8\npercent sulfur, and 13 percent ash. From\nTable 1. we see that o"y underground\nmined coals meet these specifications.\nThe Central Utah coal ftelds in the Price\narea typically meet or exceed in quality\nthese specifications and adequate reserves\nare reported to be available for long-term\nctmtracrs. In the UCLA-DWR stcdy. these\nUtah coal fields are identified in Table 1\nas Fields 4. 5, and 6 According to the\nCiCUA report, Table 7, at the typicat operatini: parameters of a 800 mw coal-fired\npower plant burniiig coal with a heat cont n of 12,000 Btu and 1 percent sulfur,\ne:\nabout 2 million tons of coal would be conswned each year. Assuming a 40-year plant\nlife, the total coal required is 80 million tons. Translating this quantity back\nto ccal in the ground, or reserves, and\ncalculating d t a total recovery of 40 percent (a reasonable over-all recovery ratio\nfor underground mines), a reserve of about\n200 million tons would have to he dedicated to this power plant. This reserve\nfigure on a proportional basis is almost\n25 percent greater than that wbich was\nassumed adequate in the UCLA-DWR study \xe2\x82\xac o r\na 500 mw plant.\nr-\xe2\x82\xac\n\nPerhaps a closer look at these coal\nfields will serve t o highlight some of the\nwide differences in the character of these\ndeposi t-s .ind, therefore, the likelihood\nfox meaningful differences in mine development schedules. A good case in point is\n\nthe Black Mesa, Arizona, coal field\n(Number 3 in Table 1. It has the poten)\ntial to provide a quality coal that would\nmeet the environmental standards achieved\nwith the base case coal. In a report\nfrom the Arizona Bureau of Mines (Ref. 4);\ndata were given and which data seem to\njustify taking a much closer look at this\nfield (Table 3 ) .\n\nIn. ications are that Arizona\'s Black\nMesa coal deposits with its high quality\ncoals will. despite the present political\nsituation, be further developed to meet\nthe state\'s coal needs as well as those\nof the neighboring states. including\nCalifornia. However. significant coal\nsupplies from these fields are not expected to be available until the 1990\'s.\nOne potential coal source that did not\nmake the UCLA-DWR list is the Beluga coal\nfields in Alaska. The questions ot\nAldskan coal as a viable source of supply\nfor California keeps coming up and. indeed.\nwa- investigated in the UCLA-DWR study.\nThey concluded that at least in the near\nterm, coal from Alaska could not be competitive in price with Utah coal and further, that the problems associated uiLh\n1\nthe siting of ; suiydble coal port unloading and rail transfer shipment facility is substantial. Although it is diEficult to argue against this conclusion,\nwith the public facts available to tis\ntoday, I do not believe Alaskar, coals\nshould be written off at Lhis time. It\nmay be premature. For example, an article\nin the 16 .?anuary 1978. ANCHORAGE TI.IES\n(Ref. 5) reported that Plscer h e x\nproceeding with their plans to develop a mine\nin the Beluga Luai field, producing from\n6 to 19 million tons a year for markets\n:\nu\nthe Nest Coast and Japan, and possibly\na mine-mouth generating facility.\nThe Beluga coal field is in the b o k\nInlet sedimentary basin and is about 60\nmiles west of Anchorage. According to\nk G e e (Ref. 6 ) . it is believed to contain\n2 . 4 billion\ns of coal with about 400\nmillion tons strippable using todiy\'s\nmining technology. The coal ranges in\nrank from sub-bitminous to lignite, 13\nto 3 3 percent moisture. 13 to 35 percent\nash, 7.200 to 8,900 in Bt:i content dad\nsulfur content below 0.20percent. It is\ninteresting to note that Placer Amex\'s\nBeluga Coal Project Status report of\nDecember 1977. indicated the first coal to\nbe mined will have about 20 percent moisture, 16 percent ash, 7,200 Btu and 0.18\npercent sulfur. Bv coal washing, the Btu\ncontent would be raised to 7.500 Btu.\nI believe it was us \'ul in the UCW-DWR\nstudv of coal availabiiity ;a establish\nthe basiccoal quality specs that w w l d be\nappropriate in a baselice case study of\ncoal-fired power generatim in California.\nHowever, I believe it is just as important\nto recognize that the model coal does not\n\nprcclsde the use of coals having a laver\nBtu. or coals having higher sulfur contents. For any specific coal, the pou@r\nplant desLgn and tire envirorental r uirerents are i-tcrrclared with the speci Lcations and burning characteristics of the\ncoal. For this reason, the potential\nsources of coal supplies for California\nproba31y emxed those identified In\nTable 1 . Again, all this Just supports the\nconcl-rsion I started with. that there are\n-le\nouppltes of coal for California. if\nproper recognition is taken of the factors\nthat are neeessrr:: TO assire a reliable\nand economic supply at the time it is\nneeded. Some of these "ifs" will now be\ndiscussed against t r backdrcp cf adeqwste\nie\ncoal deposits C r o p videl7 varying geographic areas with each area having their special economic and regu1a:ory requirements.\nIn most cases, these requiretcents have to\nbe met in a th-specific sequentia: sequence. And m s t o t these requiremen:s\n:b\nare on the critical pt.\n\n7\n\nTo ;!lustrate their overall iwact. a\nLarRe surface mine on federal lands would\nsu kc- rrgm 12 t n 14 yczro t o dcvelop to\nf r i l l produrt inn. For & 1itrt:c underground\n:\nm i n e . I he t i m c r r m - could br extended\nanother 3 to 5 years as the construction\nti-s ara greater and run up to full production takes longer. A more detailed\n:p\nloor at the major ses in the Pine development process would also show : a an\nht\nearly coorritment by a utility is essential\nand that nonaa1lI the coamitment mcst be\nmade shortly after the decision is made t o\nbuild a coal plant. This cormaitment point\nis probably the mort significant one in\nthe entire time schedule because it gives\nthe full speed ahead signal for all the\nother actions required by the mining company.\n11.\n\nW O E STEPS IN THE HINE\n\nDEVELOPMENT PXOCESS\n\nIf time were available. I would like to\ndiscuss the mine development process in\n\':he detpi- Riven in an excellent paper\nprepared bv James R. Jones (Ref. 7). In\nthis pape-, Joaes explains the ten major\nsteps required to deve1.Jp a sx-face mine\nin the Hest on federal lands. As shown\nin Figure 2 and explained in Jones\' paper.\nhe started out with a number of federal\nleases sufficient to constitute a logical\nThe market development phase\nmining unit\ncan thus begin the second year. Now let\nus take a look at the situation where a\ncompany daes nor have any federal leases.\nShmld a coal company today r .-zivenotice\nthat a utility i s seeking bids for a suppl! of m a l with deliveries beginning in\nton years, and if :hat company does not\nalready have federal leases under their\ncontrol. i t wwild not be in a favorable\nposition to resnond to t\\? utility\'s bid\nbascc\' on coal from federally leased lands-the owner of about 8C percent of western\ncoal which ialifornia must rely on. Under\nthe new Federal Coal Leasing Amendments\nA L t o f 1977 (FCLA) and the recent\n\njudgement rendered under the NRDC v.\nHu \\es suit, the earliest d a t e f e d e r &\nl\nleasing can be resumed is n w es(\ntrmated t~ be in mid-1980. If these c rditions prevail. they would preclude anv camp m y E t a btading unless they were already\nw e l l iqto the stage of delineating their\ncoal reserves and the quality of the minecane\nable coal. And these data can o ~ l y\nfrom an extenzive drilling program. In\nother words, only those companies vhich\nhad been willing to invest substantial\ncapital in the hope that a market would\ndevelop vould be in a reasonable position\nto render a bid to supply 2 to 3 million\ntons of coal per year for a power plant\ncolning on stream in Less than ten years.\nAnother important facpor to keep in mind\nis that the diligent development requireC\nacnts under the F U of 1977 .pecify that\n2% percent of the total reserve in a iogical mining unit must be mined by 1986 or\nthe leases will revert back to thc gnvernPent.\n.ierefore. companies holding a d r velopec. federal leases may soon be running\nout of time.\nIt would also appear in this hypothcticase. i F the plant ucrc. f o hc sited in\nCalifornia. that the utility had already\nsubmitted their "Notica of Intent" which\nmeans that the plant criteria and the coal\nspecLfications would then be "locrced in"\nand the nuder of potential suppliers would\nbe reduced considerably. Even in this\ncase, asslraing a coal supplier had the\nnecessary coal quality and reserves. and\nwas actively seeking a market, the time\nrequired to proceed with the necessary\nfederal and state permits. prepare an EIS.\nand secure all rhe necessary approvals\nwould, in most bestern states. be a lengthy\npro?ess filled with many uncertainties and\n"ifs" that will resdt in delays in the\nmine development schedule\nDevelopment of\na mine to its full production in eight to\nten years wovld be a very close race. even\nassuming that there were no delays in the\nentire process.\ncal\n\nTf all this sounds negative. I wanc KO\naslire you thar this is not my intent. nor\n~?y\npersonal feeling. To prove to you thar\nmy optimism is based on solid ground. I\nhave some statistics that clearly show chat\nthe coal industry and the ucility icdustry\nare working together in other paris of this\ncouncry and that they are comaittea to\ncoal.\n1x1.\n\nFUTURE COAL PRODUCTION\n\nEach year the National Coal Association\nmakes an annual study o \xe2\x82\xac the industry\'s\nplant for new mines and expanded production\nfrom existing operations.
