The requirements will be used to develop a ROTO system for both automatic and manual piloted operation under normal and reduced visibility conditions. Requirements were determined for nose wheel/rudder steering, braking/reverse thrust, and the navigation system with the aid of a non-real time, three degree-of-freedom MD-11 simulation program incorporating airframe and gear dynamics. The requirements were developed for speeds up to 70 knots using 30 ft exit geometries under dry and wet surface conditions. The requirements were generated under the assumptions that the aircraft landing system meets the current Category III touchdown dispersion requirements and that aircraft interarrival spacing is 2 nautical miles. This effort determined that auto-asymmetric braking is needed to assist steering for aft center-of-gravity aircraft. This report shows various time-history plots of the aircraft performance for the ROTO operation. This effort also investigated the state-of-the-art in the measurement of the runway coefficient of friction for various runway conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950016257, "id": "6a0d0b0f12e14d72aa36023ff0bf58ac", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950016257.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950016257/downloads/19950016257.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950016257/downloads/19950016257.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950016257/downloads/19950016257.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
