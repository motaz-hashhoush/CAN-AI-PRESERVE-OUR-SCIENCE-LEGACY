The subject matter of an LSA is defined by the customer's needs; when and what will be launched is also stated in the LSA. The technical requirements of the launch are contained in the Payload Integration Plan. The price for launching payloads is determined based on factors such as payload control weight and length. The allocation of risks and liability for damage to person and property involved in STS operations is examined; a cross-policy waiver governs property damage, and third-party liability coverage is required. Consideration is given to the policy governing reflying of a commercial mission in the event of an initial failure and to modified LSAs.", "title": "The structuring of NASA launch contracts", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T05:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870054906, "meta": {"author": {"name": "O'Brien, John E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "60141ab9268f4bcc99295aaebbc4ee24"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870054906, "publications": [{"volume": "5", "submissionId": 19870054906, "issn": "0167-9368", "id": "11ee4e0de0d9407b9793ee7746adad10", "publicationName": "Space Communication and Broadcasting", "publicationDate": "1987-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
