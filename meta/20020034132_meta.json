Vapor pressures, obtained using a Knudsen cell technique, and near properties, obtained using a vacuum four-ball apparatus, were measured for a series of unformulated liquid lubricants. These include: two multiple alkylated cyclopentanes (MACs) (X-1000 and X-2000), two linear perfluoropolyalkylethers (PFPAEs) (Z-25 and 815Z), and four silahydrocarbons (a tri-, a tetra-, and two pentas). Vapor pressures were measured at three elevated temperatures (423, 448, and 498 K) and extrapolated to room temperature 298 K. The lowest 298 K vapor pressure of 5.7 x 10(exp -14) Pa, was obtained with the PFPAE fluid (815Z) and the highest value with the low molecular weight MAC (X-1000) at 3.6 x 10(exp -7) Pa. In addition, vacuum near rates were determined for some of the lubricants. The lowest wear rates (approximately 3 x 10(exp -11) cubic mm/mm) were observed for three of the silahydrocarbons while the highest wear rate (approximately 2 x 10(exp-9) cubic mm/mm) were observed with the two PFPAE fluids (Z-25 and 815Z). The MAC (X-2000) yielded a wear rate of about 10(exp -10) cubic mm/mm. The results indicated that the silahydrocarbon class of liquid lubricants offers the better potential for space applications.", "title": "Volatility and Wear Characteristics of a Variety of Liquid Lubricants for Space Applications", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T16:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20020034132, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nguyen, Quynhgiao N."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "eca3438721ce466086839edf32531104"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20020034132, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jones, William R., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "d78df5a06f544b40be6e22596b29905c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020034132, "endDate": "2000-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "ccd22c4686a649c4a54be2dd9240cd53", "id": "93e643ac222a4bde892fec6b0b47bdc2"}], "name": "55th Annual Meeting", "location": "Nashville, TN", "id": "ccd22c4686a649c4a54be2dd9240cd53", "startDate": "2000-05-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 20020034132, "publications": [{"volume": "44", "submissionId": 20020034132, "issue": "4", "publisher": "Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers", "id": "50e7155261f24901b254c1aa00321e67", "publicationName": "Tribology Transactions", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
