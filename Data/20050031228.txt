b'SUPPORTING WEATHER DATA\nORIGINATING TECHNOLOGY/\nNASA CONTRIBUTION\nSince its founding in 1992, Global Science & Technology,\nInc. (GST), of Greenbelt, Maryland, has been developing\ntechnologies and providing services in support of NASA\nscientific research. GST specialties include scientific analysis, science data and information systems, data visualization, communications, networking and Web technologies,\ncomputer science, and software system engineering. As\na longtime contractor to Goddard Space Flight Center\xe2\x80\x99s\n\nEarth Science Directorate, GST scientific, engineering,\nand information technology staff have extensive qualifications with the synthesis of satellite, in situ, and Earth science data for weather- and climate-related projects. GST\xe2\x80\x99s\nexperience in this arena is end-to-end, from building satellite ground receiving systems and science data systems, to\nproduct generation and research and analysis.\nAmong the company\xe2\x80\x99s advanced software designs is the\nRegional Digital Information Network (RODIN), which\nwas originally designed under contract to NASA Goddard.\n\n65\nRODIN is a Web-based information system that employs\nunique GST-developed methods for extracting, organizing, and searching metadata in such a way that allows fast\nretrieval and staging of stored geospatial data from different\nsources and in any format on the basis of time, location of\nthe data, or other user-defined attributes. While providing\na low-cost alternative to archive and retrieval systems based\non fixed data formats, the RODIN framework provides\nmuch of the functionality of large, expensive data systems.\nRODIN offers the distinct advantage of not being bound\nby any one data format. In addition, it has the built in capability to automate the search, retrieval, and dissemination\nof data and data products over the Web.\n\nENVI RONMENT AND RESOU RCES MANAGEMENT\n\nPARTNERSHIP\nGST developed RODIN for Goddard\xe2\x80\x99s Applied Information\nSciences Branch as a core capability that would underpin the\nNASA Regional Applications Center (RAC) program. The\nRAC program was conceived to provide a nimble, locally\nimplemented and controlled advanced data system that\nwould enable universities, businesses, and local communities to jointly address environmental-related applications\nor issues of local or regional importance. While the RAC\nprogram is no longer actively supported by NASA, the\nRODIN software lives on through its transfer to private\nindustry. Under a license from NASA, GST has continued to modify and develop RODIN as an add-on\nenhancement to the company\xe2\x80\x99s commercial products.\nPRODUCT OUTCOME\n\nThis screen shot shows the Regional Digital Information Network Observation Interface for the browsing and ordering\nclient application.\n\nBased on its earlier work with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Applied Information\nSciences Branch, GST introduced DirectMet\xc2\xae in 1999, a\ndirect-readout Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite Receiver and Workstation for the ingestion,\nprocessing, and analysis of geostationary satellite imagery.\nUsed worldwide by professional meteorologists, DirectMet\nis employed extensively throughout the Caribbean and\nPacific to support hurricane tracking among many other\napplications. The system allows automated user-defined\n\n66\nscheduling, subsetting, and product creation, and has\nunique built-in meteorological analysis functions.\n\nENVI RONMENT AND RESO URCES MANA GEMENT\n\nA new DirectMet archive based on the RODIN technology provides DirectMet with a scalable, expandable archive\nsystem that allows both directed and automated archiving\nof raw and processed data, imagery products, and project\nfiles. Data are fully retrievable by time, location, area,\nproduct, and spectral band.\nAnother application of RODIN is through MetLab,\xe2\x84\xa2 a\n\xe2\x80\x9cnext-generation\xe2\x80\x9d meteorological workstation developed\nby GST in partnership with 3DI, Inc., in 2002. MetLab\nwas recently adopted by the U.S. National Weather\nService as its internal World Area Forecast System Aviation\nWeather Terminal. Deployed from Hawaii in the Pacific to\nthe Caribbean and South America, the workstation provides comprehensive data and toolsets for the professional\nforecaster. GST is developing a RODIN-based archive\nsystem for MetLab\xe2\x80\x99s weather data that will be marketed as\na comprehensive local meteorological data archive system\nto support local climate and weather studies. This archive\nsystem is needed by small countries around the world that\ndo not have immediate or reliable access to the vast NASA\nor National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data\nholdings that are accessible to the U.S. community at various data centers.\nRODIN\xe2\x80\x99s unique design has applications that extend\nbeyond those of immediate interest and use to NASA and\nthe weather communities. GST plans to develop RODINbased archive and retrieval systems that will enable it to\nserve as a powerful, stand-alone archive for virtually any\nEarth science-related data system.\nDirectMet\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Global Science & Technology,\nInc.\nMetLab\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Global Science & Technology, Inc.\n\nThe DirectMet\xc2\xae GOES-GVAR system captured Hurricane Frances, a Category 4 storm, as it headed towards the\nBahamas in August 2004. One of Global Science & Technology, Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s many customers in the Caribbean depended\nheavily on the DirectMet system as the storm approached.\n\n'
