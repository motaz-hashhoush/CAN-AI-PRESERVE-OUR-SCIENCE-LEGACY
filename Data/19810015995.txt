The Philippines is the first of a series of countries to be\nassessed. The primary purpose of this Philippines study is to identify\napplications with high P/V Males potential so that P/V equipment suppliers\nand distributors could develop appropriate marketing strategies. The\nfollowing essential information for the Philippines was gathered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Estimates of potential market size for P/V power applications in\nthe agricultural sector.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Power requirements and usage profiles for a wide variety of agricultural applications which are compatible with a P/V system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operating and cost characteristics of gasoline and diesel power\nsystems that would compete against P/V systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Energy, agriculture and development goals. programs and policies\nwhich will influence P/V sales.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Appropriate financing mechanisms and estimates of capital available\nfor P/V system purchases.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Channels for di.tribution. installation and maintenance of P/V\nsystems.\n\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Appropriate methods for conducting business in the Philippines.\nThe types of applications considered are those requiring less than 15KW\nof power and operating in a stand-alone configuration without back-up power.\nThese applications include irrigation. post-harvest operations. food and\nfiber processing and storage, and livestock and fisheries operations.\nStudy Approach\nA team from DHR. Incorporated and Associates in Rural Development. Inc.\nconducted a month long study in the Philippines during October and November\n\nx\n\nI\n\n1980. The major activities of the team were a arias of meetings with Pilipino\nenergy, economic, financial. business and policy experts to obtain current\ndata and their evaluation of factors important to introducing P/V power systems\ninto the agriculture sector. Site visits were made to obtain power requirements\nand energy use profile data for several agricultural applications. In addition\nto data collection o the team members gave presentations on P/V systems. and\n\ndistributed sets of brochures consisting of advertising material obtained from\nU.S. P/V companies and from U.S. government sources.\nThe information gathered served so a data base to characterise the onvironwent in which P/V systems would be marketed and used. Zar s on applications was\nused to identify cost-competitive and-uses. The potential market alas estimate\nwas based on cost-competitiveness, availability of finance, business environment, and other factors. Due to the inherent uncertainties present in such\nanslysss, throe - otsntial nwarket estimates are presented - "Status quo." "increased activity." and \'Optimistic."\nStatus of P/V in Philippines Energy Development Plans\nPhilippines is highly dependent on foreign oil for co me rclal energy.\nIn 1980, oil accounted for about 90 percent of the annual commercial energy\nconsumption, or more than double the level of 15 years ago. The rising oil\nbill has made the Philippines extremely aware of the ijW : rtance of changing\nIts energy source six and improving consumption efficiency. Domestic oil,\ngeothermal. coal. hydroelectric and a number of other renewable and nonconventional energy sources are viewed as major possibilities for helping\nreduce oil imports. The Philippines have embarked on an ambitious five year\nprogram aimed at reducing their dependence on foreign oil. Strategy components\nsupporting this plan include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The accelerated diversification from depletables to alternative\nsources of energy. with *Mhasts on indigenously abundant and\n\nregenerative forms.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tne establishment of support infrastructure to enable efficient\nprocessing. handling, storage, distribution and marketing of\ntraditional and new energy resources.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Application of appropriate decentralised energy facilities for arwas\ndifficult and costly to connect to centralised systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The strengthening of collaborative efforts with other nations in\nemergency supply sharing and technical expertise interchange.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The concentration of energy research and development on energy resources\nthat are locally abundant for dispersed applications.\nThese strategies would favorably influence the use of P/V in the\nSowever, the toverasent has ^;o t included a sisxnificart\n\nPhilippines.\n\nus to the abeam; of government s torts to apply famlIt" and cost-effective\ntechnologies, and to wait for the more industrialised and developed countries\nto develop and reduce the costs of more experimental and sower technologies.\nP/V systems are clearly viewed as an sxperimental technology in the official\ngovernment energy plans.\n\nThe Philippines has embarked on an ambitious rural electrification program\nwhich expects to fully electrify the country before the and of the decade. While\nthis would dampen the deN4nd for P/V use agriculture, DHR does not expect it to\nhave too great an effect on the market. This is due to the fact that many agricultural applications would not be served by the "backbone" type rural electrification system being promoted irk the Philippines.\nimplications of Philippines Agricultural Development Plans for P/V Systems\nThere are several important development policies :--d programs within the\ngovernment agriculture sector that relate specifically r. opportunities for\nP/V systems. The interest in P/V systems for use in agricultural products\nbeing promoted by the government will be greater than in those products with a\nlesser rota in the development plans. The major crops in which increased production\nIs being strongly supported are rice and corn. Secondarily, programs in cattle,\ndairy, and cotton are considered of critical importance, although production\nhas not been increasing as fast as intended. The crops discussed below are chosen\ndue to their importance for P/V applications throughout all production phases of\nthe crop.\nR\n\nRICE--Though the Philippines has reached self-sufficiency in rice,\na 4.4 r4rcent annual increase in rice production has been targeted\nfor tte 4 978-1982 period to keep up wirh population growth an.. provide\nan adequ.:e buffer stock. Of more importance to P/V applications\nis the attempt by the government and farmers to reduce use of fossil\nfuels and nonrenewable energy in rice production and processing.\nImproved irrigation and methods of water pumping are a continuing\npriority. However, there have been increased crop losses recently\ndue to nonuse of powered irrigation, as farmers have not wanted to\npay the increased cost of gasoline. P/V sya.ems would also be\nimportant in rice drying and milling.\n\ne CARD --Increasing corn production for buman consumption is a major\nemphasis at this time due to a large domestic production deficit,\nand the resulting importation of about 120,000 metric tons per year.\nMoreover, the key limiting factor to increasing animal production\nin the Philippines is the lack of feed grains. Production is\ntargeted to increase by 20 to 25 percent over the next six years.\nThis increased production is meant to reduce the need for imported\ncorn and to increase the availability of corn as an animal feed.\nA role for P/V power is expected in irrigation, drying, and grinding.\na OTHER CROPS--There are several crops for which, although P/V does\nnot sees a likely power source in actual production $ it could be\nutilised in support facilities and at central building complexes\non large farms. Sugarcane. bananas, pineapple, and casava are crops\nin this category. However. a role for P/V power systems for irrigation of high value crops such as spices, garlic, etc., is most\nfeasible.\ne 7151 PROD=ION--Agusculture\nare a priority area in the\nrole for P/V systems is in\nwater Pumping and aeration\n\nand cos3mercial fisheries developrct\ngovernment development plans. A major\nlc* making for fish preservation and for\nin aquaculture.\n\nxii\ni\n\nAvailability of Financing Mechanisms and Funds\nThe Philippines has an extensive financial network composed of both private and government-owned financial institutions. The majority of investment\nfunds are controlled by the privately owned, commercial and savings bank sector.\nThese funds are available as short-term working capital loans primarily invested in industry, consumption, commerce, real estate and public utilities.\nLong-term investment capital amounted to !6085.2 billion ($832 million) in\n1977. Of this amount !731.5 million ($100 million) was loaned to the agricultural sector. The Development Bank of the Philippines is the major source\nof long-term capital for agriculture. DHR estimates that only a small part of\nthis capitol will be available for `:naancing P/V systems.\nNational Electrification Administration (NEB? has been the source of funds\nfor the expansion of rural electric cooperatives. While there is currently no policy\ncommitting NEA to financing of P/V systems, it could be a possibility since\nthe purpose: of rural electrification and P/V is similar. The status of NEA\nconcessior.al loans as of December 1979 was nearly $1 billion, of which $218\nmillion was from international sources such as US AID, World Bank, France,\nNorway, etc. In 1980, concessional loans for wood-fired and mini-hydro power\nplants were obtained from French and Norwegian sources. The very low interest\nloans being granted by NEA will most certainly improve the economic viability\nof P/V systems.

Thus,\nunder ideal conditions, the potential power needs could be as high as 34MWp\nper year. This represents an upper bound on the market.\nAnother indicator of the need for small mechanized power units in\nPhilippine agriculture could be gauged by the projected sales of small gasoline engines, averaging Shp each.

Most long-term financing in agriculture is\ndirected through the development banks, which are in turn partially financed\nthrough multi-lateral donor agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank and the\nWorld Bank, and bilateral agreements between the Philippines and donor countries.\nThese banks function not only as lending agencies but also as agents of government policy objectives. This dual function creates the need within the development banks to evaluate loans in terms of their economic benefits to the nation\nas well as their benefits to the potential applicant. An economic analysis\nmeasures the profit to the nation while a financial analysis measures the\nprofit to an investor of a project. Interviews with the Development Bank of\nthe Philippines planners indicated that the bank will in the future adopt economic\nanalysis of projects as part of their evaluation of loans. Once this practice\nhas been instituted, loans will be given according to the following criteria:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Loans would be given if projects pass both an economic and financial\nanalysis.\n\ns\t\n\ne If a project passes an economic analysis and not a financial analysis,\nit would be more likely to receive funding than if it passes a\nfinancial analysis and fails an economic analysis.\ne Finally, if a project fails both an economic and financial analysis,\nit will not receive funding.\nxvi\n\nConsidering that most long-term agricultural financing in the Philippines\nIs presently directed through the Development Sank of the Philippimse\nphotovoltaic firms wishing to sell to the goverment or to goroermwnt-financed\nprojects may have to justify on economic grounds the viability of these systems.\nMe in considering potential photovoltaic applications bas included in its\nevaluation of photovoltaic systems both an economic and a financial analysis.\nThe purpose of using both types of evaluations is to provide photovoltaic manufacturers with an idea of the economics under which these systems\nwill be financed by the development banks and private entrepreneurs in the Philippines.\nThe assumptions used in the economic and financial analyses are shown\nIn Table S and 6. Economic and financial life-cycle cost analyses were performed to determine how P/V systems would compete with conventionally powered\nsystems currently in use. The analyses assumed that. below 1.2KW capacity P/V systems\nwould compete with gasoline generators. The competitor for larger systems\nwould be diesel. Table 7 shows the year in which P/V systems would be costcompetitive with conventional systems. It also shows the breakeven life cycle\ncost of P/V energy in S /KWH in the first year of cost competitiveness.\nTable S ASSUMPTIONS USED IN COST ANALYSES\n\nFinancial Analysis\nj\t\n\nInflation\nDiscount Rate\nLoan Rate\nLI:* of Conventional System\nFuel Cost Escalation\nFuel Cost in 1980\n($/U.S.\t Gallon)\nAnalysis Lifetime\nDepreciation\n1.\t P/V System\nII.\t Conventional System\nMarginal Tax Rate\nSalvage Value\nLabor Cost\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n132\n212\n142\nEquipment Lifetime\n16.41 (nominal)*\n1.43 (diesel)\n2.42 (gasoline)\n15 years\n\n122\nEquipment Lifetime\n31 (real)\n1.18 (diesel)\n1.18 (gasoline)\nIS years\n-\n\nLump Sum\nSue-of-Digits\n52\n102\n$11hour\n\n51/hour\n\n*16.42 nominal a 32 real\nSOURCE:\t Development Bank of the Philippines and World Bank\n\nTable 6 P/V SYSTEM COST PROJECTIONS\n\n1980\t\n\t\nsystem Cost (s/Wp)\n\n1962\t\n\n1964\t\n\n1986\t\n\n1988\t\n\n1990\n\n20.85\t\n\n11.73\t\n\n9.14\t\n\n6.55\t\n\n3.28\t\n\n4.40\n\nSOURCE: Estimated from .tat Propulsion Laboratory, 1951 Photovoltale Syst gs Development\nProgram Summary Document data.\n\nG1t\nF\n\nxvii\n\nTable 7\n\nRNAKK AM RCONOWC ANU MUM 6 3% WAAL PJIL OORT M MMAM M RAT!\'\n\nfw\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\nilws1on11o1s\n1) \'WWwdCm: a3KW\n2) \'londord Ctm: &6 KW\n3) \'le WwdCan: RKW\n1) SWWWdCM.- IKW\nS) Seendetdcme:\t IOKW\ne) Slendord Come: M KW\n7) Fish bad Gotherine Fwrip\n6) tronsco ivef\n9) AWkwhurol b onsion/Slide\nProjects\xe2\x96\xba\n\n10)\n\nLow" Sits\n\n11) Corn Grinder, low Use\n12) FomongWion\n13) Mainienonce Yard\n11) Rico, Double Crop Mw\nSingle Crop Corn, I MA\nIS)\n16)\n17)\n18)\n19)\n\nNice Garden, 1 MA\nMedium Rice Mill\nSmdl Rke Amu\nhown, Fish Mothery\nRice, Double Cr". 1 MA\n\nitil^l\xe2\x96\xba^MFee\xe2\x96\xba1\n\nuMNew\n\n.SOWA .\nOw1:909\t\nM Ir9 rMINSP OW gw8111rI-110\n611tH\t * Mnu I1MMO1Mi1i11MVIS\nomm"a8)\n1M^N\n\nmwmm\n\nIMO MEM\n\nwftws\n\nsnow\n\nOIIM11N\n\n1961\n1961\n1M0\n1M0\n1~\n\n1900\n1900\n196"\n19"\n1900\n\n19/01)\n19101\xe2\x80\xa2p\n\n1901\n\n0.01\n0.03\n\n19110(-)\n\n466\n1.77\n611,\n\nOM\n\'1\'1.11\n13.92\n\nan\n0.19\nan\n0.23\naaw\n\n6177\nG."\nan\nan\nO.SO\na 77\n\n190\n\n00.23\n\xe2\x96\xbaI.ON\n01.00\n\n1900\n\n0.61\n0.77\n\n6107\n\n1901\n\n1900\n\na6S\n\nan\n\nQO11\n\n1911\n\n190\n\n0.97\n\n0.77\n\n1.01\n\n1910\n1910\n1910\n\n1963\n1M1\n191\n\n0.43\n\n0.59\n0.69\n0.69\n\n0169\n1.76\n\n0.36\n0.36\n\n1.67\n\n199\n\n1966\n\n0.39\n\n0.73\n\n2.01\n\n1916\n1916\n19011\n\n1901\n\n1908\n19119\n\n0.60\nass\n0.99\n0.69\n1,12\n\n1969\n\n1961\n1906\n1901\n\n0.31\n0.30\n0.30\n0.30\n0.50\n0.27\n\n0.59\n\n2.11\n2.44\n5.09\n1.67\n\n1905\n1901\n\n20) Corn Grinder, Avg.

Used on economic analysis criteria, only applications\nsmaller than 2KWp are cost-competitive prior to 1987. Using financial analysis\ncriteria, mainly due to the higher effective fuel cost, systems lass than\n2KWp become cost-competitive by 1984.\nThese results imply that if P/V systems sales depend on government financing, only small systems would be eligible for loans in 1981-85 time-frame.\nThus the near-term market would be small. However. an examination of the types\nof low power applications show that many users of such systems could consider self-financing. These are applications used in corporate farms, or\noperations generating sufficiently large revenues. They include: flab stock\ngathering, transceivers. battery chargers for logging operations. forestry\nstations, maintenance yards, and fish/prawn hatcheries.\nMarket Assessment\n\nThe market size estimate is based on the hypothesis that a market will\nstart developing when P/V systems are cost-competitive, on # life-cycle\nbasis. when compared to its least-cost, practical alternat te. At this point,\nthe market share of P/V systems will be close to zero, as the conventional\nsystems have the added advantage of existing supply and repair facilities,\ntradition, smaller initial cost. and corresponding greater flexibility.\nAs the cost advantage of P/V systems grove so will its market share. We assume\nthat once the cost equality point is passed, the rate of penetration of P/V\nsystems will depend on other factors such as equipment turn-over rates, awareness, availability of finance, marketing strategies, availability of marketing\nchannels, and other market-related factors. We also assume that P/V systems\nwill first penetrate into areas where users are already using powered equipment. For example, they will be more acceptable to a farmers using a gasoline\nengine driven oump than one who irrigates the field manually.\nThe previous discussion showed that the size of the technically feasible\nmarket in the Philippines is large. However, there are several constraints\nto achieving this market. The most serious barriers are:\ne Awareness --There is, in general, a lack of awareness anong end-users,\nprivate and public banking and business communities, and government decision. makers as to the possibilities for P/V.\ne C^ st Competit i veness --P/V systems must be economically and financially\ncost-competitiv , with the least-cost practical alternative on a\nlife-cycle basis before its use will be seriously considered. Furthermore, Philippine consumers are very sensitive to first costs.\ne Financial --The availability of capital for long-term investments is\nvery small an(; will hinder the development of a substantial market.\n\nxix\n\nThe last constraint is, in our opinion, the most serious barrier to\ndeveloping a large P/V market.. Based on the above mentioned constraints and\t\nthe incentives described earlier, three market penetration estimates sre\ngiven. They are based or. the following scenarios:\n\ni\n\n"Stag o"--assumes that existing perceptions and attitudes of endusers, business community and government, persist and the level of\nactivity of P/V manufacturers is unchanged. It also assumes that the\nbasis for cost-competitiveness is an economic analysis based on the\n32 fuel cost escalation rate, since loans would be primarily from government sources with minimal private sector purchases of P/V systems.\n\n"increased Acttyity"- - assumes greater government interest, additional\n\ngovernment financing, aggressive marketing by P/V companies, and considerable interest and awareness. It also assumes that larger\noperations or those generating large revenues would self-finance P/V\nsystems. Thus cost-competitiveness is based on financial analyses\nusing a 3% fuel cost escalation rate.\n"Q&tJaL tU "--assumea a definite government commitment towards P/V,\npriority government financing, very strong interest and awareness,\nless affluent operations entering market, private sector financing,\nfinancial cost-competitive analysis, a greater fuel cost escalation\nrate, in addition to the incentives described in the previous scenarios.\n\nBased on the current level of financing in the agricultural sector, DHR\nestimates of capital available for P/V systems financing is shown in Table\nS. The estimates reflect the fact that there is a significant "learning"\nor awareness problem associated with P/V use and until that barrier is broken,\nno significant amounts of P/V systems will be installed. DHR estimates that\nIt will be at least 1985 before this barrier is minimized. The data in Table\n8 reflects only financing available from Filipino sources for commercial use\nof P/V, and does not take into account foreign funds supplied for demonstration\nprojects. Estimation of funds available for the latter activities is highly\nuncertain. Thus, making such estimates would be fruitless.\nTable 8 DHR CAPITa AVAILABILITY ESTIMATES\nCapital Available from Private and Public\nFilipino Sources (1000\'s of 1980 US$)_\n6cualo\n\nIM\n\nStatuOu0\nte s\n\n1962\n1969\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1147\n\n20\n40\n60\n120\n200\n300\n\nloss\n\n1969\n1990\n\nso0\n\n700\n1000\n\nlnerossed ACtLW\n200\n600\n1000\n1600\n2000\n2200\n2500\n2000\n4000\n\noPtlesstic\n\nSoo\n1000\n1500\n2100\n2500\n3200\nAM\n6800\n10,000\n\nr\n\nxx\t\n\ni\nt\ni\n\nOn the more positive size. with greater P/V company activity. it assumes\nthat most small applications $ currently cost-competitiveg will be purchased\nby the more affluent userr. These include transceivers * logging operation\nbattery chargers, maintenance yard power supply. forestry stations, and prawn \t\nhatcheries. In most cases, the amount of capital required is well within the\nc resources of the users (for example. annual revenue from an average prawn hatchery\nIs about $60.000). In the 1981-85 time frame, cost competitive mild applications\nused by the more affluent groups mount to about 8.5MWp of power for the financial\nanalysis case, and about 1MWp for the economic analysis case.

The Non-Con Center\'s major role is technology development. but is increasingly involving itself in technology delivery and information dissemination\nactivities directed at users, especially in rural areas. The Non-Con Center has\ninitiated several P/V irrigation pumping experiments to evaluate their suitability\nfor use in Philippine conditions. Four small 200-25OWp demonstration irrigation\nsystems have been installed under the auspices of the United Nations Development\nProgram in cooperation with the Non-Con Center and the Farm Systems Development\nCorporation. Two of the systems were supplied by Solar Electric International.\na U.S. company. and the other two are French systems. The German government\nhas proposed a $4 million P/V system for electrifying a village. An agreement\nIn principle has been worked out between the German government. the Non-Con\nCenter and the Technology Resource Center. The system is expected to be in\nplace by the and of 1981. AEG-Telefunken will supply the P/V system and train\nFilipino technicians to operate and maintain the system. The military is also\nexperimenting with the use of P/V powered pumping systems for use in the\nsouthern part of the Philippines.\n\nxxi\nw\n\n{\n\nI\ni\n\nIn moving beyond experimentation and demonstration to commercialisation.\ngovernment energy experts are skeptical as to the appropriateness or m itch\nof P/V to their needs. Their major concern or reservation was based o;,, the\nhigh present market cost of P/V systems. This seemed to be the key inhibitor\nto a more widespread and higher level of interest necessary to mow beyond\ndemonstrations. They are taking a vast-and-sea attitude toward P/V system.\nOnly an improvement in the relative first cost of P/V to competing energy sources\nwill address this inhibiting factor. and create an atmosphere and possibility\nof increased interest. At that time. it will be possible to address remaining\nconcerns about P/V performance (a.$., reliability and durability) that can\nonly come with user experience in the field.\nEntrepreneurial Interest\nThere is currently an active and enthusiastic entrepreneurial interest\nIn photovoltaic* by Filipino businessmen. In interviews with both large and\nsmall industrialists, there was the attitude that photovoltaics could develop\nas a viable energy industry in the Philippines. Both a large industrial\ncorporation and a large commercial bank have expressed interest in financing\neconomically viable photovo]taics projects, as well as establishing a local\nphotovoltaic industry. Smaller firms, presently involved in selling flat\np ,te collectors. have also expressed an interest in establishing contact\nwith American photovoltaic manufacturers with the purpose of establishing\njoint manufacturing or marketing of photovoltaic systems.\nIn general. the level of knowledge and sophistication about potential\napplications, markets and photovoltaic systems is higher in larger firms. In\naddition. larger firms appeared to be interested in technology transfer\narrangements with the United States, while smaller entrepreneurs expressed\na willingness to act as dealers for photovoltaic systems. A number of entrepreneurs. both large and small, inquired about the possibility of setting up\na regional production facility in the Philippines to service the ASEAN market\n(Singapore. Thailand. Indonesia. Malaysia and the Philippines). These entrepreneurs felt that it may be possible to obtain preferential tariff duties\non an ASEAN photovoltaic facility from the ASEAN community. One firm\nhas advertised small photovoltaic systems in Philippine newspapers with\nlimited sales success. These systems were designed to power radios and\nelectric fans and are geared to the upper-middle and upper-class market. To-date\nthis businessman has not been able to penetrate this market successfully.\nOne problem (often cited businessmen) is the fact that potential customers\nare familiar with such larger systems. For example. farmers irrigating\ntheir fields commonly use S to 10 hp pumps. Smaller photovoltaic systems\n(below 1KW) are viewed with skepticism by farmers who feel that P/V cannot\ndo as good a job as a gasoline or diesel pump in irrigating their fields.\nTable10 summarises the current status of interest in F/V systems.\n\nxxii\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 10 PRESENT STATUS OF INTEREST IN P/V STSTEMS\n\nAM\t\n\nMile Moor\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xbatesstt states\no Lack of tafetsstion as Ph y soverneset Msislos-eskers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wit and sae attitude tewtds Ph y asssq officials.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 sbaptieiw by planners that Ph could easpoto with blow\nand blesses.\n\nPrivate sector\t\n\no Active and estbuslastic ontreprawrtal interest is P/Y by\nFilipino buslaeswea.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Interest by Velvets bwisass gs is establishing costm.ts eitb\nM sssufactarsrs is the V.S.\n\nBusiness Environment for Marketing P/V Systems\nPresently. American manufacturers of photovoltaic systems have several\nadvantages in developing the Philippine market. First. there is an sstablished dealer/service/wholesaler network that is extensive and familiar\nwith American products and business practices. Second, photovoltaic systems\nhave been granted a number of tax incentives in order to promote the use of\nthese systems in the Philippines. Third, there are a number of entrepreneurs\nwilling to invest in local production of photovoltaic systems in joint ventures with American firms. Finally, as a pioneer industry photovoltaic systems\nwill be granted priority access to capital from all government-owned or controlled financing institutions.\nPotential disadvantages to American development of the Philippine market\nIs the presence by foreign firms currently being established through demonstration projects.\nTable 11 summa rites the advantaeas and disadvantases of the *resent business\n\nr, t\n\nTable 11 cMARACTniSTICS OF THE PHILIPPINE BUSNESS CLIMATE\nf\nt\nAm\n\nPresent status\n\nPereip coopstitiM\n\na\n\nU.S. Iowa to sister senerater of field.\n\ne\n\nstrong seepstitten by awrepena and japssieas AD are Interested\nor are cu.vfttly, svelopiag P/V Markets.\n\ne\n\nLocal P/V industry my develop in war future.\n\na\n\nP/V designated pioneer industry.\n\na\n\nGoveremest Offers a saber of financial incentives to manufacturers\nto site plants is the Philippines.\n\nsusiaws Rsviroasiast\n\na\n\nDealers often act M exclusive agMta for products.\n\nDealer/Iapo[cac/Masufaecute! \t\nRelationship\n\na\n\nSal" are on Indent basis.\n\na\n\nCredit teem reap up to 60 days for moll equipment \xe2\x80\x94 iastalluest\npayment term for lots* stasis (232 deposit\xe2\x80\xa2 2 year muthly isstal lmats) .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDealers do sot usually stock Ligb value parts.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMatatenasee of wall systems left to purchasers--lass\xe2\x80\xa2 system\nearvined by dealer.\n\ne\n\nYarriety term are ease and two years wreally.\n\na\n\nusai.,acturer/d\xe2\x80\xa2olars selling to cover meat or goverwest-flamed\npro l acts must be accredited.\n\nIsvestasat clinate\n\nService/Maintess"e\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCurtest shortage of skilled workers.\n\na\n\nGenerally, all U.S. standards ate acceptable\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStandards and Regulations\n\nP/V \xe2\x80\xa2a\xe2\x80\xa2siptod tea all taxes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nM system would haw import duties and taxes levied.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLump sun depreciation for P/V system allowed.\n\nconclusions\nThere are many characteristics of the Philippine agriculture and energy\nsector that favorably influence the use of P/V systems. They include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Stated government policy towards promotion of renewable. and\ndispersed power sources.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Financial incentives for the production and use of P/V systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High cost of conventional energy supplies such as gasoline and diesel.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Entrepreneurial interest in P/V systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cost-competitiveness of P/V systems when compared to gasoline and\ndiesel power sources in a wide range of agricultural applications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Availability of suitable marketing channels for sale of P/V systems\nIn the agricultural sector.\n\'\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The shortage of skilled labor for maintaining competing systems.\n3Miv\n\nHowever, wry significant and serious barriers prevent achieving the\ntechnically feasible, coat-competitive market for P/V systems in the agricultural sector. These include:\ne The lack of awareness of the possibilities for P/V systems.\ne The shortage of capital for financing P/V systems.\ne High first costs of P/V when compared to competing systems.\nThus, if the status quo is maintained, the market for P/V power systems\nin the Philippine agricultural sector will be scull. The mast ._ t_\ntee\nr\nreason for the limited market is the availability of capital for financint\nP/V s stang . If this constraint could be relaxed, then the cost-effective\nmarket becw:.es larger by several orders of magnitude. Thus devising Innovative financing schemes and promotional campaigns could ha\xc2\xab a very high\npayoff. The market would be mainly small power applications in the pre-1985\nperiod with sales to affluent individuals or corporations. In the post-1985\nperiod the market for larger systems could open-up if long-term financing is\nprovided by the Philippine banking community.\n\nA\n\nf\n\n^\t\n\niii&\n\nxxlt\n\n\'.\t\n\nMAR1<ET ASSESSl1E11T OF PHOTOVOLTAIC PGMiR\n\nRMM\n\nAGRICULTURAL APILICA?IOIIS m3am\nISFORT NO.

Ongoing research,\ndevelopment and demonstrations are directed at achieving major system cost\nreductions and field experiences with P/V power systems. The program is\nmanaged by the U.S. DOE and consists of several project offices, one of which\nIs the Photovoltaic Stand-Alone Applications Project Office at NASA Lewis\nResearch Center, Cleveland, Ohio. this project office is conducting international market assessments to ascertain whether stand-alone P/V power\nsystems can provide useful and economically productive power for various\napplications in developing countries, during the next several years.\n1.2 ObJectives\nThe Photovoltaic Stand-Alone Applications Project Office of NASA/Lewis\nResearch Center (NASA/LeRC), Cleveland, Ohio has sponsored a contract to conduct an assessment of the potential for remote photovoltaics (P/V) power\nsystems in worldwide agriculture. the types of potential photovoltaic applications considered in the contract are &-hose requiring less than 150 of power\nand operating in stand-alone configuration without back-up power. These\napplications include: irrigation, post-harvest operations, food and fiber\nprocessing and storage, and livestock and fisheries operations. A team of\nD11R.

These economic and usage data were used in DHR\'s "P/V Market Assessvent" computer model. This model computes life-cycle costs, and the year\nIn which the P/V system first becomes cost-competitive with its nearest\ncompetitor. Figure 1.1 is an overview of the DHR methodology.

Chapter 6\ndescribes economic and financial analyses for selected applications and\nestimates the probable size of the market in the agricultural sector.\nChapter 7 describes the business environment in the Philippines. This\nChapter,- together with Appendix B, "Doing Business in the Philippines,"\nprovides an overview of the relevant Philippines business community and the\nspecific advantages and disadvantages for developing P/V markets.\n\n1-7\n\ntr\n\n2.0 DEMOGRAPHIC OVERVIEW\n\n`\t\n\nThe Philippines has a population presently approaching 50 million,\ndoubling within the last 25 years. The three percent annual average\ngrowth rate has resulted in a population whose median age is 17-18\nyears. The per capita gross national product (GNP) is about $500\n(U. S.). Nearly one-tenth of the population lives in the capital\nof Manila and its suburbs, and another two-tenths reside in other\nurban areas. Seventy percent of the population is classified as\nrural.\nFifty percent of employment is within agriculture, fisheries,\nand forestry. However, this sector contributes only 25 percent\nof the GNP, as nearly seven out of 10 farmers are rice and/or maize\nsemi-sufficient farmers. Less than one-third of the land is considered\narable, and of the 11 million hectares of the land devoted principally\nto agriculture, 75 percent of it is badly eroded. The average farm\nsize has been estimated at close to\n\nA\n\nhectares.\n\nThe Philippines is an archipelago, about the size of Arizona,\nthat is divided into three island groups: Luzon, Mindanao, and\nVisayas. Although it consists of 7,100 islands, 11 of them comprise\nin area more than 95 percent of the country\'s total area. Luzon,\nin the north, is the largest island. At present, central Luzon\nis the nation\'s rice bowl, and the bulk of irrigated land occurs\nt\t\nt\n\nin this section. However, by the year 2000, western and northern\nMindanao are expected to provide the majority of the nation\'s rice\nneeds. Mindanao is the second largest island and lies in the south.\n\ni,\n2-1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nThe other nine islands, the Visayan, constitute 29 percent of the\ns total area of the country. The northern regions (Ilocos, Cagayan\nValley, and central Luton), the western Visayan, and !Mindanao are\nthe most important areas of intensive crop farming.\nLarge-scale operations produce sugar, bananas, and pineapple\nfor export, and are increasingly moving into poultry and swine production.\nSmall-holders and subsistence farmers primarily produce food grains\nfor domestic use and coconut for export. Although the farm population\nis more or less equally divided among regions, man-land ratios and\nfarm size differences are quite marked. Regions with the most cultivable\nland resources per person are the Cagayan Valley, central Mindanao, and\nto a less degree, western Mindanao. fSee Appendix F).\n2.1 Energy Situation Overview\nEnergy demand has been increasing steadily in the Philippines\nover the last two decades. In the mid-sixties, average per capita\nannual energy consumption was the equivalent of 1.1 barrels of oil,\nbut had risen by 1980 to two barrels. ! Figure 2-1 and Table 2-1,\non the following two pages, show the historical mix of energy consumption,\nas well as indicating the direction in which the government intends to\nmove while reducing the present heavy reliance on imported oil.\nIn fact, the Philippines is so highly dependent on oil for commercial\nenergy that in 1980 oil acco=ted for about 90 percent of the annual\n\ni Basic statistics and an overview of the Philippines energy situation,\nespecially in terms of government development plans, can be found\nin the "Five -Year Energy Program, 1981-1985," available frcm the\nMinistry of Energy (MOE) in Manila.\n\n\t\nt\nF\ne\n\n2-2\n\nFigure 2-1\n\nHISTORICAL i PROJECTED\nENERGY MIX\nSIN PERCENT)\n1002\n\n10NAL\n7Sx\n\nRIC\n1L\n\nS02\n\n2S2\n\nIL\n\n02\n1\n\nSource: "Five-Year Energy Program, 1981-1985," Ministry of Energy,\nPhilippines\n\ni\n\n2-3\n\nNATIONAL RNMY SOURCR MIX\n\n(1n million batrelsotvil equivalent.

Domestic oil, geothermal, coal, hydroelectric# and\na number of other renewable and nonconventional energy resources\nare viewed as major possibilities for helping reduce oil importr\nand are presently under development.\ne DOMESTIC OIL -- Extensive exploration and oil production\nhave only recently begun in the Philippines. However, initial\nhopes during the late 1970s that oil production would climb\nabove 10 million barrels annually, and provide eight percent\nor more of the national energy supply, are now being questioned.\no GEOTHERMhL -- The Philippines has an extensivc geothermal\ndevelopment program underway, and this energy source has\nhigh potential for greatly increasing the electrical energy\nsupply and for changing the energy supply six. During the\npast eight years, geothermal power has increased from approximately\n10 MW of capacity to about 1,200 MW of potentially feasible\nproduction. This resource does vary considerably, however,\namong the major islands, as it is not present on all nor\nis it equally distributed where it is present.\nCOAL -- Domestic coal production has also increased quite\nPast\neight year* to approximatedramatically, up eightfold in the\nly 300,000 metric tons. According to Philippine government\nprojections, further incroases in production (and increased\nexploration of new reserves) will increase the volume of\ncoal use from 2.4 percent of total commerical energy consumption\nin 1981 to 13.4 percent by 1985.\ne HYDROELECTRIC -- There is still considerable potential for\ntapping hydroelectric power in the Philippines. This potential\nvaries greatly frtv reqion to region and from island to\nisland. further information on locations and production\nprojections are given in section 3.2 on rural electrification.\nMini-hydroel*ctric system are also a major fo c us of recent\nactivity and are listed in Table 2-2 under nonconv*ntional\nenergy sources.\n\n2-5\n\ni\ni\nC\ni\n\ni\n\ne OTHER RENEWABLE AND NOKVNVENTIONAL RESOURCES -- Table 2-2\nshows the Ministry of Energy\'s supply projections for what\nthey consider to be the key technologies and sources for\nthe Philippines. Of potential competitive importance is\nthe development of the use of marsh gas/natural gas emanations,\nwind, agricultural w&stes, or producer gas technologies.\nAlthough they are not yet in widespread use, potential development of these technologies is a factor for site-specific\napplications. where the government and the private sector\nare experimenting with their feasibility and performance.\nOf particular importance tn the potential P/V market is the\ndevelopment of bio-gas technology, which, for example, can\nbecome a direct competitor with P/V in poultry, swine-raising,\nor feedlot operations.\nAn energy supply plan presently under development is the\ngrowing of Ipil-Ipil. a fast growing tree. for dendro-thermal\npower plants. Another program is the ongoing effort to develop\nan alcohol fuel program using sugarcane and casava as feedstocks.\nThe Rovernment and the private sector are pursuing this option\nwith p roduction and sales scheduled for 1981.\nImplications of the Energy \xe2\x96\xba situation and Government Enera_y Plans\nfor Pa systems\nThe widespread awareness of what the cost of imported oil is\ndoing to the Philippine economy and the desire to seek and develop\nalternatives, provide a situation where P/V could be of benefit and\ninterest. However, the government has not included a significant\nrole for P/V in their five-year energy plan. The main rationale\nand thrust of government efforts is to apply well-known and costAffective technologies, and to wait for tho more industrialised\nand developed countries to develop and bring down the price of more\nexperimental or newer technologies. P/V systems are clearly viewed\nin this latter category in the official government energy plans.\nHowever. although the projected role for\n\n?IV systems in the\n\nPhilippines is low in total peak kilowatts when compared to present\nworldwide\n\n?IV production levels and sales. the Philippine market\n\npotential is significant.\n\n2-6\n\ni\n\nTable 2-2\n\n1M1tGV\t\n\nIstma"\t\n!N[aGY szrMMs\n(In thouaand barrel"NO equivalent.

The intent in compreasing the plan is to\nspeed up the development of indigenous energy resources and the adoption\nof energy strategies that will sake the Philippines increasingly selfsufficient.\nFigure, 2-2 shows the organizational chart for the Ministry of Energy\nas it existed in late 1980.

However, as of\nthe Philippine visit by the DHR team, the arrays had not yet been installed\nin the field and exact siting was uncertain.\n\nE\n\n2-10\n\nFIGURE 2.3\n\nNoncon Center Organization\nMINISTER OF ENERGI\n\nASSISTA\\T\nSECRETARY\n\nl\n\nCE\\TER FOR \\0\\(O\\\\E\\TIO\\kl\nE\\ERG1 DE% ELOP\\IE\\T\n\n\\LD\nRE(,IO\\aL\n1+P \\\\( HFti\n\n"c\\GI\\cERI\\G`\nI L 1BOR ATOR1\n\nnl\\ IcION J\n\nAl l RLD11 EU\n\\O\\CO\\\nCF\\TFRS\n\n&,DN11\\IcTR ATnR\n\nDIVISI\n\nLAR\nDI V ISIOti\nLS ) I (0 D V SIIONGA\n\nLD\n\nNOLOGI QD1HNOLOG\nOPMEJS7 ESSME%I\nVIS10%\nISION\t\n\n(\n\n7DWNISTRATI^ E\t\nDID ISIO\\\t\n\n2-11\n\nFI\\A%CE\nDIVISIO\\\n\nWATER POWER\nDIVISION\n\nT1ECHNOLOGl\n\nPROMOT10%\n\nDIVISION .\n\nSPECIAL\nPROJECTS\nDIVISIn\\\n\n3.0 PHILIPPINE DEVEIAPNW PLANS\n3.1 Economic Development Plans\nThe.modern industrial sector, --j used primarily of manufacturing,\nconstruction, and mining and quarrying, is heavily concentrated\naround Manila and accounts for about one-third of gross domestic\nproduct. The large, mostly traditional agriculture\'and service sectors\ncontribute the remaining two-thirds. Overall economic growth has\naveraged approximately six percent annually since 1970. In agriculture,\nthis was mainly due to increases in rice an* corn production.I\nThe economy is still heavily dependent upon the export of a few\nprimary goods, i.e., sugar, coconut products, copper ores, and forestry\nproducts, for its foreign exchange earnings. Nontraditional exports,\nsuch as bananas and pineapples, however, have become increasingly\nimportant. Trade deficits have averaged one billion dollars for the\npast five years. This is roughly equivalent to the cost of crude oil\nimports, which represent more than one-fourth of the total imports. The\nincreasing cost of oil-based energy, which represents 90 percent of the economy\'s\nenergy requirements, is helping to fuel inflation at a current rate of\n2\n13 percent.\nThe government believes that two key issues must be addressed\nby their overall development plan. 3 First, with a rapidly increasing\n\n1Ste "Country Development Strategy, FY 1982 -- Philippines," Agency for\nInternational Development.\nThis is an official Philippines government estimate of the inflation rate\nin 1980.\n3These overall goals are taken directly from the "Ten-Year Philippine Development\nPlan, 1978-1987", and the DHR team did find commitment among government officials and programs to the general thrust of the plan.\n3-1\n\nwork force, there is a need to find productive work for people. Second#\nthere exists the pressing need to correct the negative balance of payments situation. Consequently, the present government policy consists\nof two main components:\n1) mobilization of the rural sector to expand labor-intensive\nagricultural production and labor-intensive small- and\nmedium-scale industry to serve rural demands and,\n2)\n\nexpansion of labor-intensive export products to earn\nneeded foreigr exchange.\n\nThe government has stated that capital-intensive and high-risk\nactivities, or those of a service nature, will be the government\'s main\nconcerns. As is discussed in later sections of this report, the role of\nthe private sector is vital in the government\'s economic development\nplans, and is clearly considered a primary actor in both energy and agricultural development activities. In sum, the government has adopted a\nstrategy of developing energy self-sufficiency through increasing reliance\non indigenous and renewable sources of energy, and has coupled this with a\npolicy of increasing agricultural production and efficiency of fossil fuel\nuse in most agricultural activities. Increasing energy self-sufficiency\nand agricultural production are to be brought about within the framework\nof developing more rural areas.\n3.2 Rural Electrification\nThe Philippines has been rapidly accelerating their rural electrification program and view it as a major and important development goal.\nThe aim of the government and the power development program is the total\nelectrification of the country by 1985. within this plan, electricity\ngeneration and transmission is the responsibility of the National Power\nCorporation (NAPOCOR), and the organization of electrical cooperatives is\ncarried out by the National Electrification Administration (NEA) for power\ndistribution and retail.\n3-2\n\n\t\n\nThe power sector in the Philippines consists of over 800 public and\nprivate utilities, the majority of which either own and operate generating\nunits of less than 10 !W capacity, or purchase and distribute power for \t\n\nN\n\nbase load requirements from HAPOCOR, the biggest single power -producing\nutility in the country. Average national energy availability from all\n\n^.\t\n\npower utilities was estimated in 1980 to be 3,301 W. Small private utilities and municipal systems provide power in many areas not covered by the\npresently developed grid networks. Table 3-1 shows the installed gene.\t\n\nrating capacity and the projections for 1985.\nThe NEA involves itself mainly in the electrification of rural areas,\nleaving the private sector to cover urban areas. Over the next five years,\nNEA will be concentrating on the distribution of power generally made\navailable by NAPOCOR. This is to be accomplished primarily through the\nformation of cooperatives. In 1979, NEA set up six additional cooperatives,\nmaking the total of registered cooperatives 116. Table 3-2 shows the status \t\n\nI\ni\n\nof electrification in the NEA cooperative structure as of early 1980.\nFigures 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3 show the present and planned generating\ncapacity that will provide power for the rural electrification program. \t\n\n!\nS\n\nPart of the goverrunent \' s change in the new five -year energy plan has been\nto emphasize geothermal, hydroelectric, and coal plants as a move away\nfrom oil. NEA provides capital loans to cooperatives connects-d to the\nNAPOCOR grid at three percent interest for a 25-year term with a five-year\ngrace period. For self-generating cooperatives, the interest rate NEA\ngives is two percent with a 25-year loan term and five-year grace period.\ni\t\n\nTable 3-3 shows the cost in dollars of installing distribution lines and\nof hookups.\n\n3-3\n\nOW\n\nTabl\xe2\x80\xa2 3-1\n\nINSTALLED GENERATING CAPACMZ$ BY It9ClgN\n\n(In rnegawatts, MW)\n\nMw\n\n1980\nPercent\n\n1941\n\n1985\nPercent\n\nMW\n\nMw\n\nPercent\n\nLuzon\nHydroelectric\nDiesel/oil\nCoal\nGeothermal\nNuclear\n\nNonconventional\nSubtotal\n\n549.00\n2.312.00\n-\n\n440.00\n-\n\n16.63\n70.04\n13.33\n-\n\n567.50\n\n17.03\n\n1.516.50\n\n2,316.00\n-\n\n59.54\n\n2.364.00\n\n440.00\n\n1320\n\n-\n\n24.28\n37.84\n9.60\n\n013\n\n600.00\n1,045.00\n620.00\n101.52\n\n3,33314\n\n100.00\n\n6,247.02\n\n100.00\n\n0.48\n92.07\n6.73\n0.72\n\n9.30\n504.70\n\n1.52\n\n52.90\n\n82.16\n\n90.00\n6.00\n\n14.65\n0.98\n\n-\n\n0.69\n\n551.70\n160.00\n681.00\n4516\n\n3.55\n37.01\n10.73\n45.68\n3.03\n\n100.00\n\n1,490.86\n\n100.00\n\n1,251.60\n475.30\n-\n\n72.17\n27.41\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n3,301.00\n\n100.00\n\n2.00\n382.80\n28.00\n3.00\n\n7.74\n\n-\n\n16.73\n\n9.92\n1.63\n\nViseyes\nHydroelectric\nDiesel/oil\nCoal\nGeothermal\n\nNonconventionaJ\nSubtotal\n\n415.80\n\n100.00\n\n4.26\n614.26\n\n312.00\n383.30\n-\n\n40.92\n50.08\n-\n\n382.20\n\n48.47\n\n406.30\n-\n\n31.53\n-\n\nMindenoo\nHydroelectric\nDiesel/oil\nCoal\nGeothermal\n\nNonconvcntional\nSubtotal\n\n-\n\n-\n\n765.30\n\n100.00\n\n933.00\n3,078.10\n28.00\n443.00\n-\n\n20.82\n68.,#8\n0.62\n9.88\n\n-\n\n7.22\n\n0.42\n\n1,734.12\n\n100.00\n\n20.25\n\n2,821.00\n3,391.00\n760.00\n1.90\n9.42 1.726.00\n620.00\n154.00\n0.23 1\t\n\n29.78\n\n68.18\n\n35.80\n\n9,472.00\n\n100.00\n\n-\n\n788.50\n\n100.00\n\nPbilipp, its\nHydroelectric\nDimuoil\nCoal\nGeothermal\nNuclear\n\nNonconventional\n\nTo tal\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n4,482.10\n\n100.00\n\n959.00\n3,229.00\n90.00\n446.00\n12.00 1\t\n4,736.00\n\n1\t\n\n100.00\n\n1\t\n\n8.02\n18.22\n6.55\n163\n\nSource: "Five-Year Energy Program, 1981-1985," Ministry of Energy,\nPhilippines\n\n3-4\n\nR\n\nTable 3-2\n\natus\nRural Electrification -- status of Energisa=\n\nAs of\nDecember, 1978\n\n1979\n\nAs of\nDecember, 1979\n\n88\n\n12\n\n100\n\n651\n\n178\n\n829\n\nBarrios energized\n\n6 1 995\n\n1,823\n\n81818\n\nHouse connections\n\n845,137\n\n272,658\n\n1,117,995\n\nCo-ops energized\nTowns energized\n\nSource: National Electrification Administration, 1979 Annual Report\n\n3-5\n\n\t\n\nFigure 3-1\n\nLuzon Power Projects\n\nLEGEND:\t\n\nn\n\nU\n\nIII NE R AT1110 PLANTS\t\n\xc2\xae mvdm At\nQRU\noI T.W\n/\n11 O.I\t\n\n`T\n\n\\\n\nnNIAKa\n\nQ C"AI TI.r111Ar\nN om, \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2^..,\n\nILOL:OS\nNO\n\'\n\nAM$UK LAO NE\n\n888 111111wr\nCOAL TN[RMAL 11\n\n\\\n\n1\t\n\nILOCOS\n\n/\t\n\nSUR\n\nIsw11Ys\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1AAGAT Hl\n\n7801rw I I N7r\t\nIN r^nN)\t\n\n/\t\n\n/\n\nPROVINCE\n-4\n\n1\n\n/\t\n\nI\t\n\nLA UNIbN , IFUGAO /\n\n[Ah ROOU[ HI\t\n\nIE k" 1N0\t\n7\n\nI\t\n\n0JW/AM\n\n9"MATIO\n\nt\t\n\nIENGLIET\t\n\n[TI\n[L\n^[I\nW\n[^;\nWi\n[w,\n1^7\n\n%LAS WAS\' HE\t\n17 nw nYn\t\nPANTAIAMGAN Hg\t\nIOD\xe2\x80\x94\' , 1/7r\t\nANGAT M[\t\n317 No nMr\t\n\n_ / ISMl::\nMOUNTAIN\n\nMINGA NJ\n\nI^YA rINO\n\na\n\nfoot. nN1\n\nAPAYAO\\\n\nAIRA\t\n\n(!\n\nif OAK LAN G1\nW\n\n/gNIO H[\n\n^(KALINGA\n\n,\t\nI\t\n\nCAGAYAN\n\nI\t\n/\t\n1 Ky^.o\n\nROCKWILL THERMALQ\n30$-- 1196)\nOARON[R THERMAL Q\n\ni\t 0 \xe2\x80\x94 11.10\n\n(\t\nca\n\noA"\xc2\xb5\t\nOUIRINO\n_ I, TOGON VIZCA\nvlturr\n\n\xe2\x96\xba ANGASiNAN\t\n\n\t TH[\t RA4L\n70C ..w rrN)\t\nSA \xe2\x80\xa2DO It\nSNVD[R TH[AMAL\n\n\tIOC. 111+7r\t\n\na\n\nIATAAN\n\n7fI.\xe2\x80\xa2+\n\n\xe2\x80\x9er\t\n\nTHERMAL\t\n\n^\t\n\n77 YM\n\nr 1.. r\t\n\n[!;\nILI\n\n%AURORA\n\nr\t\n\nf\t\n\nMAK IAN OEO\n1 1 8n\' 1\n11A \xe2\x80\xa2,.

MA stated that 30 percent\nof the rural cooperatives operate an average of 24 hours a day, and that\nsame operate only about six hours a day due to the cost of oil.\nAs already stated, the aim of the goverment and the power development\nprogram is the total electrification of the country by 1985. The country\nis presently considered to be approximately 4S-SO percent electrified.\nHowever, almost all of this is in metropolitan areas or towns, and little\nhas reached into rural areas. of importance to P/V use is that it is\nnecessary to interpret what 100 percent electrification will mean in actual\ndelivery of electrical power to rural areas. The Philippines is using a\nbackbone grid system and plans to connect secondary lines to the backbone\nat lator times. This "100 percent" figure for rural areas means only that\nthe backbone will be in main towns and villages. Many smaller villages,\nislands, and rural areas may remain unelectrified into the 21st Century.\nThis fact was repeatedly confirmed by the MM team in discussions in the\nPhilippines.\nThere are two further facts concerning the meaning of 100 percent\nelectrification that may impact upon the potential P/V market. First,\nmost electrical distribution systems in the Philippines experience\nnumerous breakdowns or brownouts, with resulting unreliable service.\nThis is especially true in the more rural areas. In fact, most of the\nlarger generators sold to industry in the Philippines are intended for\nuse as backup generators. Second, due both to lack of reliability and,\nin sane areas, the high price of electrical power, the ORR tea\xc2\xae found\nthat some consumers involved in agriculturally related activities who had\naccess to grid power preferred to buy a gasoline or diesel generator.\n3-10\n\nIn summary, P/V systems will have to ccopete with grid power for\nthose agriculturally-related processes# e.g., rice milling that can be\nlocated near the towns or villages that will be connected. however, even\nin these instances, P/V systems might occasionally be the preferred power\nsource due to unreliability or to the cost of electricity produced by\noil-generating plants. The grid will not be accessible to many field\noperations and to many of the smaller villages, probably until the 21st\nCentury.\n3.3 Agriculture\nThe major crops for which increased production is being strongly\nsupported are rice and corn. Secondarily, programs in cattle development,\ndairy, and cotton are considered of critical importance, although production of these products has not been increasing as fast as intended.\nTable 3-4 is taken from the government\'s development plan, 1978-1982,5\nand indicates the key components of ongoing government programs.\nHowever, there are several important development policies and\nprograms within the government agricultural sector that relate specifically to opportunities for P/V systems. The crops discussed below are\nchosen due to their importance for P/V applications throughout all\nproduction phases of the crop.\n\n\t\n9\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 RICE -- Though the Philippines has reached self-sufficiency\nin rice, a 4.4 percent annual increase in rice production\nhas been targeted for the 1978-1982 period to keep up with\npopulation growth and provide an adequate buffer stock. Of\nmore importance. to P/V applications is the attempt by the\ngovernment and farmers to reduce use of fossil fuels and\n\n5 1*Five-Year Development Plan, 1978-1982".\n\n3-11\n\nTable 3-4\nPriority Programs and Projects\n\nProgram/Project\t\n1.\t Production Programs\n1.

However, there have been increased\ncrop losses recently due to nonuse of powered irrigation,\nas farmers have not wanted to pay the increased cost of\ngasoline.\nNational Grains Authority (NGA) officials stated to the\nDHR team that, by international standards, about 60 percent\nof the rice crop is often of lower quality due to inadequate\ndrying. In addition to increasing the number of farmers\nusing dryers, the NGA has instructed their research and\ndevelopment units to attempt to eliminate, wherever possible,\nthe need for fossil fuel in drying and other operations for\nrice and corn. NGA officials stated that they did not see\nrural electrification as providing any major help in solving\ntheir energy needs in field operations.\ne CORN -- Increasing corn production for human consumption is\na major emphasis at this time due to a large domestic production deficit, and the resulting importation of about\n120,000 metric tons per year. Moreover, the key limiting\nfactor to increasing animal productio: in the Philippines\nis the lack of feed grains. Production is targeted to\nincrease by 20 to 25 percent over the next six years. This\nincreased production is meant to reduce the need for imported\ncorn and to increase the availability of corn as an animal\nfeed.\nIn the drier areas of the Philippines, corn can be rotated\nwith rice during the dry season, as it requires much less\nwater, even though still needing irrigation. This strategy\nis being supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and is\nexpected to spread. Also, better post-harvest drying methods\nare being encouraged because losses are sometimes as high as\n60 to 90 percent due to poor drying and infestation during\nstorage. Methods where P/V is applicable are discussed in\nchapter 5.\ne OTHER CROPS -- There are several crops for which P/V does\nnot seem a likely power source in actual production.\nHowever, P/V could be utilized in support facilities and\nat central building complexes on large farms. Sugarcane,\nbananas, pineapple, and casava are crops in this category.\nBanana and pineapple production should grow slightly for\nithe export market. Sugarcane and casava may experience more\nrapid growth in feedstocks for alcohol fuel production. If\nthe Philippine g overnment develops a large alcohol program,\nthen production of these crops will rise dramatically. As\nyet, however, there is no indication of what increased\nproduction is likely to occur.\n\n1\t\n\n3-15\n\nThere are a number of other crops in the Philippines that\nare either not experiencing increases in production or\nare not, at this time, likely candidates for P/V system\napplications in production operations. Among these are\ncoffee, rubber, cocoa, coconut, tobacco, wheat, and cotton.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION -- Poultry, pork, beef, and dairy are\nall priority production areas. Government policies support\na number of programs aimed at improving production efficiency\nand increasing the size of operations. This is especially\ntrue with poultry and pork operations where the private sector\nis extremely active in establishing larger and more efficient\noperations. However, at this time, the number of P/V applications in livestock production seems limited.\n\ni\n\n3.4 Fisheries\t\n\nThe fishing industry in the Philippines employs approximately\n795,000 fishermen and has been contributing about five percent annually\nto the GNP. Ob3ectives of the government policy are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 attain and maintain self-sufficiency in fish;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 optimize the use of fish and other a q uatic resources, and\nreduce wastage;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 promote import substitution and increase the exportation\nof traditional and nontraditional fish and fishery products;\nand\n\xe2\x80\xa2 achieve and maintain the optimum productive condition of\nthe country\'s fishery resources.\nThe strategies for the exploitation of fishery resources are to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 increase yields of existing production units in capture\nfisheries and aquaculture, and selectively expand production\nunits;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 improve the fish marketing and distribution systems to minimize\ngaps between production and consumption on the local and\nregional levels, and to retain the quality of fresh fish\nand fishery products that reach consumers;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop processed products from indigenous fishery resources\ntraditionally exported in raw or semi-processed forms;\n\nThese goals are from the "Integrated Fisheries Development Plan",\nBureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, 1980.\n\n3-16\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop fishery resource-based cottage industries and other\nancillary industries;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 develop local markets for import substitutes, and traditional\nand nontraditional foreign markets, for fish and fishery\nproducts;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 protect the fishery resources fiom illegal practices of\nover-exploitation and pollution by both domestic and foreign\nvessels; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 promote the use of appropriate technologies for the exploitation\nand use of the resources.\nThe highest projected growth rate in fisheries is 10.8 percent\nfor inland fisheries. This estimate is of importance, as the DHR\nteam identified inland fisheries as the most likely part of the\nfisheries sector for P/V applications. Electricity is presently\nused (mainly for water pumping and aeration) in hatching operations\nand in fish ponds to allow for increasing the stocking density.\nThe Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has an ongoing inland\nfisheries and aquaculture development program.\nThe incremental production in inland fisheries is expected\nto come from the increased production of existing and additional\nfreshwater and brackish water fish ponds (both government leased\nand privately owned), fish pond estates in suitable areas, and lake\nfisheries (including fish pen and cage culture). The major activities\ndesigned to realize the targeted incremental production and development\nof this specific project are fingerling production and dispersal,\nextension services, research, fish pond development surveys, and\ntraining for the private sector.\n3.5 Forestry,\nThe major effort in forestry in the Philippines is directed\nat reforestation, and at manrging and protectin; the existing forest_\n\n3-17\n\nresources, rather than increasing harvests. Forest resources came\nunder increasingly heavy pressure during the 1970s, and government\npolicy is mainly directed at assuring a long-term production base.\nOf particular interest to the energy sector is the development\nof Ipil-Ipil plantations\' The Forest Products Research and Industries\nDevelopment Commission is involved with the Ministry of Natural\nResources regarding wood production research and field production\nstrategies. Initial planting has already occurred. The National\nElectrification Administration is managing the overall effort of\ngenerating electricity using wood-fired plants. Two pilot plants\nhave been initiated: one 500 kw plant and another two to five MW\nplant. The intended users of this power are rural electrical cooperatives.\n\n`\t\n\n6Leucaena - Promising Forage and Tree Crops for the Tropics,\nNational Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1977.\n\n3-16\n\n4.0 FINANCING OF ENERGY, AGRICULTURE AND MVELOPIMM PROJECTS\n4.1 Overview of the Philippines Banking/Investment System\nThe financial system of the Philippines is a network of bank and\nnon-bank financial institutions. The banking sector is composed of the\ncommercial banks, thrift banks including savings and mortgage banks, rural\nbanks, development banks and the savings and loan associations. The nonbank sector includes investment houses, insurance and finance companies,\npension and trust funds and pawnshops. The Central Bank of the Philippines\nregulates the operation of bank and non-bank financial institutions. The\nbanking sector accepts deposits, grants loans, invests in equities, rediscounts papers and acts as trustee. In actual practice, however, each\nfinancial institution specializes in certain types of credit service.\nComplementing the financial system are specialized banks comprising o: the\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines, the Land Bank, and the Philippine\nAmanah Bank as well as government non-bank financial institutions like the\nSocial Security System, the Government Service Insurance System, the Agricultural Credit Administration and the National Investment and Development\nCorporation.\nOf the financial institutions mentioned above, six are primarily\nconcerned with investment in energy, agriculture and development projects.\nThese six financial institutions are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Commercial Banks which are active in small loans to small\nand medium industries. These loans are short-term and have\nhigh interest rates.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Savings and Mortgage Banks that grant loans in a similar\nfashion to commercial banks but cannot engage in foreign\nexchange trading, nor open letters of credit.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rural Banks which are privately awned like commercial and\nsavings banks but receive financial and technical assistance\nand incentives from the government. Rura l banks primarily\nprovide short-term working capital loans to farmers.\n\n4-1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Land Sank of the Philippines which is owned by the government and is\ncharged with the responsibility of financing the transfers of land\nfrom landlords to tenant-farriers as well as redirecting land-owner\nresources to industry or other productive endeavors.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Development banks which usually provide short to long-terra financing for\nproductive enterprises on a secured basis. These loans are given\nto both industry and agriculture. These banks are government owned.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Non-Sank Financial Institutions which extend financial services to the\ncommercial and industrial sectors of the economy. Financing is\nshort- to long-term in nature.\nA more detailed description of the above institutions can be found in\nAppendix D.\n\n4.2 Attitudes of Financial institutions Towards Photavoltaics\nInterviews with a number of private and government financial institutions\nrepresentatives were held to assess the attitudes of the financial community\ntowards photovoltaic systems. As a whole there was a general sense of\nenthusiasm and willingness of high officials to consider photovoltaics\nsystems for loans. At the project staff level , !/ however, there was a general\nsense of skepticism as to photovoltaics\' applicability in Philippines agriculture.

Capital loaned by the development banks, both private and government\nowned, rural banks, and the Land of Bank of the Philippines tend to be in the\nform of medium and long-term loans. Of these long-term lending institutions,\nonly the private and government development banks, and non-bank financial\ninstitutions as a rule issue long-term loans for fixed assets in excess of\nP50,000. Rural banks typically issue small working capital loans while the\nLand of Bank of the Philippines financts primarily land transfers from owners\nto tenants.\nCapital for long-term loans by the development banks is usually\nborrowed from either the central banks of donor countries, bilateral aid\nagencies such as the United States Agency for International Development,\nmultilateral aid agencies such as the world Bank and Asia Development Bank,\nor export financing banks such as the U.S. Export-Import Bank. As Table\n4.1 illustrates, the Development Bank of the Philippines total long-term\nForeign Borrowings amounted to over $992 million in 1979. Of this total,\nloans directly from the United States or agencies financed by the United\nStates totaled $337 million or nearby one third of total foreign borrowings.\n\n4-3\n\nf\n\n^t\n\n,\n\nTable 4.1 Long -Term Foreign Borrowings from MAID,\nWorld Bank, Export-Import Bank, U.S.\nCommodity Credit Corporation, and Asia\n\nDevelopsent Bank for the Development\nBank of the Philippines\n\n`\t\n\nForei gn Borrowings\n\nTotal Long-Term Foreign Borrowings\n\n$992,279,653\n\nU.S. AID 41% US $ loan, due 1968-1968\n\n4,860,669\n\nU.S. AID 344 USS loan, due 1974 - 1994\n\n3,460,000\n\nExport-Import Bank of the US, 64 US$ loan\n\n54,965,158\n\ndue 1974-1964\n\nU.S. Commodity Credit Corporation, 84 to 104\nUS$ credit, due 1975-1981\n\n105,938,000\n\nIBRD, through Philippine Government 714, due\n\n48,000,000\n\n1979-1992\n\nIBRD, through Philippine Government, 84 due\n\n20,000,000\n\n1978-1992\n\nIBRD, through Philippine Government 744, due\n\n50,000,000\n\n1961-1995\n\nIBRD, through Philippine Government 8j4, due\n\n506000.000\n\n1960-1993\n$337,224,027\n\nTOTAL U.S. BORROWING \t\n\n\t\nF\n\n4-4\n\n3\n\n..\n\n% "-V^ fit r -1 -\n\nTable 4.2 illustrates the relative size of total loans and investments outstanding of the major Philippine financial institutions.\nCcssmsrcisl banks accounts for 72% or over P59 billion of outstanding\n\nf\ncapital in the Philippines as of June, 1976.

The previous section\nestimated the amount of available, long-term investment capital in the Philippines in 1977 to be approximately 26085.2 billion of which F731.5 million\nwas allocated to agriculture (both foreign and domestic). In 1979, the DBP\nloaned 2424.4 million ($60 million) for domestic and 8277 million ($31 million)\nfor foreign agricultural projects. In contrast, the long-term loans given\nto cooperatives for rural electrification in 1979 amounted to 9917 million\n($125 million). These figures indicate that the amount of long-term capital\nis small and would not be available to finance large purchases of photovoltaic\nsystems. It is clear that long-term financing photovoltaic systems in\nagriculture would fall under the lending program of the DBP due to the institution\'s major contribution to the long-term capital market in the Philippines.\nCommercial and savings banks, although the largest source of capital in the\nPhilippines, would be interested primarily in short-term working capital\nloans for low-risk, familiar, technologies. This preference tends to work\nagainst photovoltaic systems. The amount of long-term capital available for\nagricultural projects appears to have been less than $60 million in 1979.\nHow much this figure will increase in the next five years would depend on\nthe development priorities of the Philippines and the ability of the nation\nto borrow long-term capital abroad. Assuming that agricultural lending\n\nNote that the best data available on entire banking system\'s\nlong-term capital loans is dated 1977. Data on the DBP\'s lending\nis more recent, dating to 1979. Both sets of data are used in\nthis section and dates are given when appropriate.\nN\n\n4-8\n\nTABLE 4.4\n0\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF DBP AGRICULTURAL LOANS BY PURPOSES*\n\nLoans (!)\t\n\nPurpose\t\n\nPercent\nDistribution\n\n228,212,788\n\n33\n\nPurchases of stocks/planting materials\n\n49,291,351\n\n7\n\nPurchase of work animals\n\n30,636,389\n\n4\n\n3,303,117\n\n0\n\nPurchase of fertilizers\n\n20,624,834\n\n3\n\nOperating and revolving capital\n\n31,589,992\n\n5\n\nPurchase of delivery and transport equipment\n\n16,539,058\n\n2\n\n221,061,464\n\n32\n\nPurchase and repair of fishing vessels,\nboats and equipment\t\n\n29,086,464\t\n\n4\n\nOthers\t\n\n71,046,819\t\n\n10\n\n!701,392,245\t\n\n100\n\nLand preparation/project site improvements\n\nPurchase of irrigation pumps\n\nPurchase. installation and repair of\nmachinery and equipment\n\nTotal\t\n\n0\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n*Includes foreign loans.\n\nSource:\n\n1980 DBn Annual Report.\n\ntYYSj S\nA\n{\n\n9\n\n4-9\n\ni\nt\n\nincreases IN per year for the next five years, there will be only $100\nmillion of long - term capital available for domestic agriculture in 1985.\nAlthough energy projects do have a priority in the DBP\'s lending program and will likely be as important in the next five years as they are\n\nM^\n\ntoday, the likelihood that long-term loans will be given by the DBP for\nphotovoltaics remains small for a number of non-financial reasons including:\ne Lack of information on photovoltaics by potential applicants\nfor loans.\ne High initial capital costs for photovoltaic systems requiring\nvery large loans for relatively small systems in terms of\npower output.\ne Competition with other energy sources such as biogas and biomass,\nalcohol, mini-hydroelectric, etc., which are relatively low-cost\nand familiar to the Filipinos.\nIt is DHR\'s opinion for the above reasons, that the total amount of\nlong-term capital that would be available for photovoltaic systems would\nbe very small. Therefore, innovative financing schemes by either photovoltaic manufacturers or U.S. and Philippine financial institutions may be\nneeded to promote American photovoltaic systems in the Philippines.\n4.5 Loan Terms for Long-Term Investments\nTo provide some indication of the terms that photovoltaic systems will encounter in receiving long-term loans, this section presents a sample of the\nloan terms for long-term loans currently being given to applicants by longterm financing institutions. Three types of financial institutions were considered: The Development Bank of the Philippines, the Private Development\nCorporation of the Philippines (a private, non-bank financial institution) and\nthe Industrial Guarantee and Loan Fund (a government, non-bank, financial in-\n\nstitution) (see Table 4.5).\n\n4-l0\nJ\n\nc\n\nTARLE\nr.J)NG-TF.RM.

Maturity\ntime for loans is short---a maximum of 15 years on fixed assets compared\nto 25 years for rural electrification loans.*\n4.6 Conclusion\nThe Philippines has an extensive financial network composed of both private and government owned financial institutions. The majority of investment\nfunds are controlled by the privately owned commercial and savings bank sectors.\nThese funds are available as short-term working capital loans primarily invested in industry, consumption, commerce, real estate and public utilities.\nLong-term investment capital amounts to V6085.2 billion ($832 million). In\n\n1977, of this amount !731.5 million ($100 million) was loaned to the agricultural sector. The Development Bank of the Philippines is the major source\nof long-term capital for agriculture. DHR estimates that only a small part of\nthis capital will be available for financing photovoltaic systems. This lack\nof capital may be a significant barrier tc the marketing of photovoltaic systems.\nConsidering that private venture capital in the Philippines tends to be\nshort-term and loans have high interest rates, there appears td be few alternatives to the development banks as a source of low interest, long-term loans.\n\n* Note that another potential barrier to the financing of P/V systems\nis related to the method used in estimating the costs/benefits of\nP/V and alternatives. These methods are discussed in Section 6.2,\nThe Need for Economic and Financial Analysis.\n\n4-12\n\nAmerican photovoltaic manufacturers or distributors will have to either\nfocus part of their marketing efforts on convincing these institutions\nthat photovoltaics are economically and financially viable and worthy of\nlong-term loans, or introduce innovative financial schemes to promote the\nsales of photovoltaic systems.\n\n0-\n\n1\n\n4-13\nF\n\nS.0 POTENTIAL PHO\' owLTAIC APPLICAnous IN PHILIPPINE AGRICULTURE\nThe major portion of data gathering activities in the Philippines\nwere dedicated to the identification and characterisation of potential\nP/V applications in agriculture. Those applications that were identified\nas possible candidates for P/V power systems were evaluated by:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Level of production/importance of crop in the Philiipine\nagriculture;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Type of operation and its ability to use a P/V power sources\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Extent of use of operation in the Philippines;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Extent of current level of mechanization of the operation;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Size of the power required (less than 25KW capacity).\nThis evaluation process identified a variety of applications such as:\nirrigation of rice, corn and sugarcanes piggeries; rice hulling; corn\nshelling and grinding; and fish refrigeration that represent high P/V use\npotential in the Philippines. The specific agricultural operations identified\nare described in later sections of this chapter and include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Irrigation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rice Drying\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rice Hulling\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Corn Milling\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continuous Cropping of Rice\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ice Plant for Fish Preservation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fish and Shrimp Hatcheries\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintenance Facilities for Large Farms\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Forestry Stations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Salt Ponds\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Miscellaneous Battery Charging Applications\nThe list of applications characterized covers a wide range of power requirements\n(20W to 12KW capacity), diverse load profiles and varying operating environments.\n5-1\n\nThey also represent a potentially large market for 8/V systems if cost\nand other barriers are overcome. It is wry likely that many other allied\napplications would fall within the operating characteristics described in\nthis chapter.\n5.1 Irrigation\nCurrently, there are 3 million hectares (ha) of rice in cultivation of which\n1.3 million hectares are irrigated by developed water resources. Current\ngovernment policy calls for irrigating the remaining 1.7 million hectares\nat the rate of 100,000 hectares per year. l Other crops requiring irrigation\nare:\ne Vegetables -- These are mainly quarter to half acre plots farmed\nby tenant or owner farmers. The vegetable plots are irrigated\nmanually and require about one to two man-hours per day. Due\nto the subsistence nature of this group of farmers, it is unlikely\nthat they would be a possible P/V system user.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Commercial Crops (sugarcane, pineapple, etc.) -- Generally, these\nare irrigated by means of high volume and/or high pressure irrigation systems. They often use 6-10 inch pumps driven by 50-150hp\ndiesel or electric motors. Thus, it is unlikely that in the nearterm photovoltaic pumping systems could replace these large pumps.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High Value Cash Crops in the Upland Areas -- These require less water\nper hectare than rice, but a higher pumping head (up to about 50m\nto 60m) is needed. Phgtovoltaic powered pumps could be appropriate\nfor irrigating these crops.\nFarmers participating in large irrigation schemes use small pumps for pumping\nwater from the irrigation channels to the fields. Irrigation water is also\nsupplied by pumps from ground water. The most common pumps size in use is\nthe 4" diameter and smaller discharge, and typical pumping heads range from\n\nlEstuar, Dr. Fiorello, Administrator, National Irrigation Administration.\nThe majority of the irrigation schemes (80%) are and will be gravity fed,\nwhile 10% will employ large pumps of the order of 100-500hp, irrigating\n100-300ha. These irrigation schemes are undertaken by the National Irrigation Administration. The remaining 10% are small irrigation pumping\nschemes Gess than 100ha), falling under the jurisdiction of the Farm\n\nF _\t\n\nSystems Development Corporation.\n\'^\t\n\ne\n\nr\nk\t\n\n5-2\n\nr\n\nSm to SOm, with the average around 15m 2 . Although the average rice field\n\nsize is 2ha, most small pump installations (about 451) service about 6-8\nha, which suggests that some pumps are used by groups of farmers.3\nIn recent years, due to the ever increasing cost of gasoline and diesel fuels, many farmers have drastically reduced the use of small pump\nirrigation. This has resulted in lowered crop productivity and financial\ndistress for the farmers. Thus, a cost-effective source of power independent\nof conventional fuels would be looked upon favorably by not only the farmers\nbut also the rural and development banks who have recently been faced with\nhigh default rates on working capital loans to farmers.\n5.1.1 Irrigation Load Profiles\nCrop irrigation load profiles depend on rainfall. There are four\ndistinct climatic zones in the Philippines. 4 They are:\ne First type:\nApril, the\nregions on\nNegros and\n\nTwo pronounced seasons; one dry from November to\nother wet during the rest of the year. All the\nthe western part of the Islands of Luzon, Mindoro,\nPalawan are of this type.\n\ne Second type: No dry season; with a very pronounced maximum\nrain period from November to January. In this class fall\nCatanduanes, Sorsogon, the eastern part of Albay, the eastern\npart of Leyte and a large portion of eastern Mindanao.\ne Third type: Seasons not very pronounced; relatively dry from\t\nNovember to April and wet drying the rest of the year. The\nmaximum rain periods are not very pronounced with the short\ndry season lasting only from one to three months. Regions\nwith this type of climate are the western part of Cagayan\n(Luzon), Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, the eastern portion of the\n\n2NIA, unpublished data on small pump characteristics.\n3These refer to pumps installed through NIA financing. Privately purchased\npumps may supply the needs of individual farmers.\nt\n4For more information see: Kintanar, R.L., Annual Climatological Review,\n1974.

The regions affected by this type are the Batanes\nProvince, northeastern Luzon, the southwestern part of the Camerines Norte, the western parts of Camarines Sur and Albay, Sondoc Peninsula, eastern Mindoro, Marinduque, western Leyte, northern Cebu, Bohol and mo*t of central, eastern and southern Mindanao.\nTypical growing seasons for various crops within each of the growing\nseasons can be found in the Philippines Agriculture Factbook and Buyers\nGuide.5\nTable 5.1 shows typical irrigation water requirements for rice and corn\ncultivation in Laguna, which is located in central Luzon, a major rice\ngrowing area in the Philippines. Only double cropping of rice and corn\nare presented in this table.\n5.1.2 Extent of Mechanically Powered Pumping\nSmall pumps, powered by diesel and gasoline engines, are purchased\ndirectly by the farmers. Financing is through agencies such as NIA, FSDC,\nthe development or rural banks, or self-financed.\nTable 5.2 shows data on Philippine pump sales as recorded by AMMDA6\nas well as pumps installed using NIA financing.

Given the limited national dryer\ncapacity, it is very likely that only 15 to 25 percent of the annual rice\nharvest (7 million MT in 1979) is mechanically dried. T!:t rescinder is\nsun-dried. Currently, post harvest losses am high due to inadequate drying. With the increasing populaxity of rice multi-cropping, the need for\nmechanical dryers will increase further due to the need for drying during\nthe wet season.\nThe International Rice Research Institute has developed small capacity\nbatch type dryer configurations which would be compatible with small IP/V\npaws systems. Their characteristics are shown in Table 5.4.

The most likely configuration would be the use\na dryer along with a farm irrigation system.\n5.2.1 Rice Drying Load Profile\nAssume a farmer with two hectares under rice, and 2 MT/ha yield, purchases the dryer. He could use the Model II dryer for four days after harvest to dry his grain. If he double-crops in Luzon or Visayas, he would\nuse it for eight days per year. The total electricity consumption would be\napproximately 35 kwh/harvest, and the power requirements would be about\n1.5 kw (capacity).\n5.2.2 Extent of Mechanically Powered Drying\nTable 5.5 shows the numbers of dryers installed up to 1979. These account\nfor drying only a small portior. of the annual rice production. Sales of\ndryers in 1978 and 1979, amounted to 63 and 73, respectively. 8 Sales in the\nfirst three quarters of 1980, totaled 46. AMMDA estimates that future sales\nof flat type dryers and circulating type dryers to average about 580 and 80 per\nyear for the next five years, respectively. If all rice were to be mechanically\ndried, the number of dryers required for the 1979 rice crop would be 20,0009\nwith a total capacity cf 70,000 MT/day. This can be compared with the current\ncapacity of 10,000 MT/day, or the probable capacity in 1985 of about 22,000 MT/day.\n\n8Source: OMA\n9Assumes 3.5 MT/day drying capacity and 100 crying days/year per dryer.\n\n5-10\n\nf\nb\nr^\n\nTable 5.5\nNUMBER OF RICE DRYERS INSTALLED AS OF 1979\nCapacity MT/day\n(12 Hour O eration^\n\nOwnership\t\n\nNumber of Dryers\t\n\nNational Grain Authority\t\n\n875\t\n\n3,083\n\nPrivate\t\n\n156\t\n\n2,059\n\nIndustry\t\n\n919\t\n\n5,443\n\nTOTAL\t\n\n10,585\n\nSou-.e: National Grain Authority, "National Drying Situation".\n\na\na\nY\n\n\t\n\nS.3 Rice Milling\nOver 99 percent of the 1979 swilling operations are privately owned and\noperated. Two major types of milling machines in use in the Philippines are:\n1\t\n\nj\xc2\xb0\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Steel Huller -- This is the most popular type of machine\ncurrently in use. Various sizes are available ranging from\n200-300 kg/hour to 600-800 kg/hour models. Power requirements\nrange from 3 hp to 10 hp (electric) 10 . They account for over\n95\xe2\x80\xa2 of rice mills installed, but only 57\xe2\x80\xa2 of the rice-milling\ncapacity.11\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Cone Type Mills -- These account for less than 5% of the rice\nmills installed, but swill about 43.* of the rice. The average\ncapacity of a mill is about 600 kq/hour and the power requirements range from 10 hp to 40 hp (electric).11\nGenerally, the mills are powered by diesel engines. A recent study12\nfound that an average of 11 hp is required tc% drive steel huller mills,\nwhile cone type mills average 42 hp. Cone type mills are generally located\nnear the main throughfares and in towns away from the main source of paddy.\nin contrast, steel huller mills are found in rural areas near the main\nsource of paddy. This mill type is often household oriented, serving primarily the needs of consumers living within the village.\n5.3.1 Rice Milling Load Profile\nRice mills are operated continuously throughout the year. However, the\nintensity of use varies from month to month, with peaks coinciding with\nthe planting months.\nA recent study 12 showed that the steel hullers were utilized an average\n\n10 Source: Polygon Agro-Industrial Corporation, Manila, Philippines.\nt\t\n\n"\'national Grain Authority, "National Milling Situation", unpublished typescript.\n\na\t\ni\t\n\n12"The Technical and Economic Characteristics of Rice Post-production\nSystems in the Bicol River Basin."

While there has been\na significant increase in milling capacity, there is still a milling shortfall\t\n\n\'\n\nthat has to be met. AMMDA estimates that the sales of the smaller steel\nhullers to average about 4,000 units per year for the next five years. Sales\nof the cone type machines are expected to average about 70 per year. Rubber\nroll type huller sales are expected to average around 700 per year. 13\n.\n5.4 "orn Grinding\nCorn is the second largest single crop produced in the Philippines. The\nproduction in 1979 amounted to 3.2 million metric tons, representing an\naverage annual increase of about 5.51 since 1977. The area under corn, however, has been fluctuating around 3.3 million hectares during this time period. 14\nTwo types of mills predominantly used in the Philippines are:\ne Grinders -- capacity range: 100-500 kg/hour; average capacity:\n200 kg /hour; typical power requirements: 3 hp electric motor, 5 hp\ndiesel engine, or 6-8 hp gasoline engine.\ne Roller Mills -- capacity range: 500-3650 kg/hour; average capacity: 1200 kg/hour; typical power requirements: 15 hp electric\nmotor, 25 hp diesel engine, or 35 hp gasoline engine.\nA recent study\n\n15\n\nindicated that on the average a grinder mill processes\n\nabout 40 , 000 kg /month of corn.

The sales of corn roller mills are expected to average\nabout 60 per year for the next five years.\n5.5 Continuous Cropping of Rice\n\n\t\nM.\n\nContinuous cropping of rice ("rice garden") is a new rice production systam currently under investigation by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Banos, Philippines. Presently, it 1-as not been introduceC\nas a general agricultural practice. It has certain energy use chrracteristics\nthat make it ideally suited for P/V systems use. In this technique, rice\nis continuously cultivated and harvested, resulting in four harvests per year.\nIRRI may soon introduce this technique to the farming community in the Philippines\n\n16 Assumed80% of the corn is machine ground; 422,400 kg of corn is ground\nby one grinder in a year (i.e., 200 kg/hour x 8 hours/day x 22 days/month\nx 12 months/year); 2,073,600 kg of corn is grounded by one roller mill in\na year (1200 kg/hour x 6 hours/day x 24 days/month x 12 months/year); and\n80% of the mills are the "grinder" type.\n\n5-16\n\nr ^-\n\nF\t\n\nTABLE 5.8\nCORN MILLING OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS\n\nHours/Day\n\nCorresponding\nDays/Month\n\t\n\nLow\t\n\nAverage \t\n\nHigh\n\nGrinder Mills\t\n\n3\t\n\n8\t\n\n14\n\nRoller Mills\t\n\n3\t\n\n6\t\n\n13\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nLow\t\n\nAverage\t\n\nHigh\n\n16\t\n\n22\t\n\n23\n\n20\t\n\n24\t\n\n28\n\nSource: Calculated from data in Almeda, et.al ., op. cit.\n\nx\nt\n\n\t\t\n\nand other rice growing countries around the world, with the hope that it\nt\t\n\ncould provide an effective moans in increasing worldwide rice production.\n\ni\nFor a typical rice garden of about 1 hectare, the land is divided into\n13 rice paddies of approximately 800 m 3 , and four seed beds of 25 si t each.\nEach plot is sequentially cultivated, planted, and harvested in a weekly\nschedule.

Thus, four crops/year are possible per hectare compared to the\ncurrent Philippine average of about 1.1 crops/year/hectare.\nThe advantages of the rice garden technique are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Seasonal labor peaks are dispersed into constant year-round\nlabor use that generate employment opportunities throughout\nthe years\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Risk of insect attack or weather damage is minimized because\nrice in each plot is in a different stage of growths and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The continuous flow of cash from weekly sales allows the farmer\nto finance the farm operation himself and eliminates the need\nfor financing.\nOn the other hand, the continuous production system has rather stringent\nrequirements for successful implementation, such as:\ne Control over a dependable year-round water supply is essential.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rice in all stages of growth in a small area, and the continued\nuse of insecticides, may bring about insect resistance to insecticides quicker than in other less intensive systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A\n\nhigh degree of management ability by the farmer is needed.\n\nRice farmers may also face resistance from laborers or neighbors if they\ntry to modify their rice farming to use the continuous system.\n\t\ni\n\nTypical equipment needed for a successful rice garden operation\nincludes: 6.5 hp tiller, 5-7 hp small thresher, small grain dryer, aad\nan irrigation pump. The latter is needed it a dependable year-rounu,\n\na\n5-18\n\ngravity fed water supply is unavailable. 17\n5.5.1 Rice Garden Load Profiles\nThe compatibility of the rice garden method with P/V power systems is due\nto the need for a year-round supply of irrigation water which closely matches\nthe solar insolation levels which are greatest during the dry months. Table 5.9\nshows the monthly water requirements for a 1 hectare rice garden. Dater requirements are the most important parameter defining monthly energy requirements.\n5.5.2 Extent of Use of Rice Gardens\nCurrently, the rice garden method is an experimental technique. It is\nabout to be publicized worldwide by IRRI. If the worldwide rice growing community\nbegins to accept this new technique, then the identification of P/V with rice\ngarden method could result in the opening-up of a large marxet for P/V powered\nirrigation systems.\n5.6 Ice Plant\nThe small ice plant is an innovative technology developed by Schultz\nIndustries with the technical assistance of the Technology Utilization\nSupport System (TUSS) of the Technology Resource Center (TRC) in the Philippines. It is one of several improved technologies being promoted by the\nTRC for commercial utilization. The ice plant answers the need of countryside farmers and fishermen for a reliable source of ice and refrigeration.\nIt is ideal for rural areas and fishing villages too small or too remote to\nbe serviced by large ice plants. In such villages, ice has become a very\nexpensive and scarce commodity.\n\n27 Formore information see:\nMorooka, Y., Herdt, R.W. and Haws, L.D., "An Analysis of the Labor-Intensive Continuous Rice Production System at IRRI."

The freezing tank can be used as cold\nstorage by simply removing the brine solution. And its condensing fan can\ndry crops, fish and clothes.\nThe ice plant has many advantages over ordinary ice plants, such as:\ne low cost\t\n\nj\n\ne ease-of-operation (requires only two people\nto run it)\ne capacity sufficient for the needs of small\ncommunities\ne reduced delivery costs.\n5.6.1 Ice plant profile\nThe ice plant is compact and self-contained. Running on a two-cylinder\ndiesel engine, it can produce 1.5 tons of block ice a day, with three cycles\nper 24-hour operation. Maximum processing time is eight hours requiring\none cubic meter of fresh potable water per Say. The ice plant requires\nmirimun technical skills to operate and needs only two operators.\nDue to the 24-hour cperating characteristics of the plant, the size\nof the P/V array required would be large: however, this example is used\nto demonstrate the cost characteristics of a system at the ulper end of\nthe scale of technologies being investigated in this study. Technical\nSpecification of the system is as follows: The main component is an ice\nmaker consisting of an open-type compressor, twin cylinder engine, fly\nwheel and drive pulley, refrigerant freon - 12, service valves, receiver\nand oil separator. The technical features of the 1.5 ton ice plant include:\nt\n\ni\n5-21\nD\n{\n\n1\n\ni\ne 29-21 hp diesel engine or 15 hp electric motor\ne 2.25 liters/hour of diesel cons=qption\ns open-type compressor with 7-10 tons refrigarating capacity\n5.6.2\n\nExtent of Use of Icy: Plant\n\nIt is estimated that a plant of this size would be adequate for a\nfishing village with a daily fish catch of 1.5 MT/day or a village with\na population of 15,000.\nCurrently, there are very many fishing villages too far from large\nice plants that have to limit their fish harvest due to lack of preservation facilities. These fishermen, (600,000 in number), account for 50%\nof the fish harvest.\n\nis\n\nSince the average annual fish harvest of such\n\nfishermen is 400 kg/year/fishermen, 19 the quantity of ice required for preservation is 240 million kg/year. Thus, the potential number of ice plants\nrequired would be at least 400.\n5.7 Prawn and Fish Hatchery\nPrawn and fish aquaculture in brackish and fresh water ponds is an\nindustry that is rapidly being developed in the Philippines. Currently\nthere are 302 hatcheries 20 operating in the Phi l Appines, each producing\nabout 10 million fry per year. 21\nPrawn and fish production is to be expanded by increasing stocking\ntt\ndensities ( from 4000 fry/ha to 50 , 000 fry /ha) and by increasing th number\nof ponds ( currently 176,000 ha) in use. This production increase is going\nto require increased hatchery facilities. Since all hatckeries have to be\nis Buresu of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR)\n19Ca . culated from data in Philippine Yearbook, 1979\n20 WAR\n21Southey^%t Asian Fisheries Development Center ( SEAFDEC), Iloilo\n\n5-22\n\n\t\n\nlocated adjacent to sources of good quality water, often away from easy\naccess to grid power, they have to use small gasoline generators (5-10hp)22\nfor power.\nW\ni\ni\n\n5.7.1 Prawn and Fish Hatchery Load Profile \t\nTypical equipment required in a hatchery is shown in Table 5.10. It\t\n\nf\n\nalso shows the equipment usage profile. This system is adequate for the\nproduction of about 10 million fry per year.\n5.7.2 Extent of Use of Prawn and Fish Hatcheries\nAs mentioned previously, there are currently 302 hatcheries in operation. SEAFDEC operates 15 at present and expects to triple the number within\nthe next few years. Data on rates of increase of the number of hatcheries\nis not available. However, an approximate estimate of the potential number\nof fish hatcheries required is 1,700 23 , supplying ponds producing a total of\n2,000 kg/ha/year of fish. This can be compared to the production in 1977 of\n657 kg/ha/year. Of course, larger hatcheries producing well over 10 million\nfry/year are possible, and in fact, one such operation re quiring about 60KW\nof power was being contemplated by a private industry group.\n5.8 Support Facilities for Large Commercial Farms\nMany large commercial farms (sugarcane, coconut, coffee, pineapple,\netc.) have facilities to store equipment, and to perform minor preventive\nmaintenance activities. These facilities also provide housing for a number\nof permanent employees.\ni\nEquipment required for a facility would include lights, water pump,\ni\ntransceiver, and possibly a refrigerator.

A similar facility would be required for the 70 forestry stations\nin the Philippines. These stations are set-up and maintained by the Bureau\nof Forest Development and are used for forestry management.\nS.S.: Support Facilities Load Profile\nTable 5.11 gives the type of equipment required and the load profile\nfor small support facilities. Power for such facilities could be provided\nby small gasoline generators of about 1.59W.\n5.8.2 Extent of Use of Support Facilities\nA recent estimate of the number of large farms in the Philippines is\nnot available. The 1971 census of agriculture showed that there were about\n4300 farms over 50 hectares in size in the commercial farm class. The.average\nsize of the farms were:\ne sugarcane - 17S ha\ne coconut - 150 ha\ne other\t\n\n- 355 ha (fruit, coffee, abaca, cattle, etc.)\n\nSince 1971, there have been substantial increases in the land cultivated with the above commercial crops. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics experts contended that it is unlikely that the proportion of large\nfarms in these crops would have have changed. Based on this assumption,\nthe number of farms over 50 he in these crops are shLvn in Table 5.12.\nDiscussions with a variety of persons appeared to indicate that a large\nmajority of these farms would not have easy access to grid power.\nAdditionally, the current energy devleopment plans call for planting 200,000 ha of new land in sugarcane for alcohol production. If a\nmaintenance facility is required for every 200 ha, then potentially an\nadditional market for 1000 small generators would emerge.\n\n5-25\n\nTABLE 5.11\nEQUIP ML\xe2\x80\xa2TiT AND USAGE PROFILE FOR SUPPORT FACILITIES\nEquipment\t\n\nPower Required\t\n\nLights\t\n\n100 W (Forestry Station) \t\n600 W (Maintenance Facility)\n\nWater Pump\t\n\n0.7 KW electric motor\t\n(higher power motor may be\t\nrequired, depending on pumping\nhead)\n\nTransceiver \t\n\n60 W\t\n\nRefrigerator\t\n(optional)\n\n400 W\t\n\nUsage Pro:ile\n5 hours/day\nhour/day (Forestry Station)\n2 hours/day (Maintenance Facility)\n\n0.5 hours/day\n4 hours/day running time\ni\n\n5-26\n\ns!\n\nI,\n1\n\nTABLE 5.12\nESTIMATED NUMBER OF FARMS OVER 50 HA IN AREA IN 1980\n\nCrop\t\n\nNumber of Farms\n\nSugar cane\t\n\n2100\n\nCoconut\t\n\n2000\t\n\nOther\t\n\n1400\n\nC\n\na\n\n5500\n\nTotal\t\n\nSource: Estimated from data in 1971 Census of\nAgriculture and the 1979 Philippine\nAgriculture Factbook and Buyers Guide.\n\na\n\n1\n1\n3"\n\ni\t\n\ni\'\n\nf\nw ^.\n\n1\t\n\n5-27\ny\n\nS\'\t\n\nr\n\nf\n4\n\nOther react* locations where such small power generation units would\nbe required include forestry stations (70).3+\n\t\n{\ni\t\n\nThus, the demand for such small units has an upper bound of about 6,500\nunits.\n5.9 Fish Ponds\nFish pond development is the most outstanding inland fishery operation\nin the Philippines. They are developed from mangrove swamps, estuarine\nl\nareas, tidal flats, and shallow coastal areas, and are used mainly for the\nrearing of bangus (milkfish) and shrimp, in brackish water. \t\nt\n\nThe average size of a fish pond operation is 20 ha. Currently, fish\nponds operate at low stocking densities of less than 10,000 fry/ha (compared\nto 200,000 fry/ha in Taiwan), and use natural algae for feed. There\nis a growing trend, and a government policy 35 for increasing the yield and\noutput from fish pond operations. Currently, over 95% of the ponds depend\non tidal water exchange for water transfer. However, with increased fish\nstocking densities, water pumping will be essential since a water exchange\nrate of 20% will be required (20,000 gal/hr/ha -- 75 a3/hr/ha).\n5.9.1 Fish Pond Load Profi le\nPumps are operated throughout the year. Pumping takes place between\n0400 and 0900 hours for about 5 hours. Frequency of operation is 2-3\ntimes a week. During the hotter months (March to June in the Iloilo area)\nan additional 2-3 hours of pumping is required at about 1500 hours.\nType of pumps required for fish pond water exchange are low head (2-3 m),\nhigh volume pumps. The water exchange requirements can be satisfied by the\nfollowing pump configurations for a 20 he fish farm.\n\n24 The8500 fish farms are also a possibility, however, they are smaller (20 ha)\nand thus may not always required such a facility.\n25 8ureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.\ns\t\n\n5-26\n\ni\ni\n\n= -,\n\ne Six inch axial flaw pump coupled to a 5 !gyp gasoline engine,\ndelivering 2500 liters per minute (660 %=) at a 3 s head.\nHumber of pumps required is four (IM design).\ne Four inch centrifugal pump coupled to a 10 hp diesel engine,\ndelivering 2500 liters per minute (660 as) at a 10 \xe2\x80\xa2 bead.\nlimber of pumps required is. four.\nThe type of pump commonly used is the centrifugal pump. Table 5.13 shows\nthe usage profile for the pumps.\n5.9.2 Extent of Use of Fish Ponds\nIn 1977, there were 8524 fish farms operating on 176,000 he 26 . These\nfarms, and any additional farms that may result from the Five.Year Developwent Plan, would form the upper-bound of the potential market.\n5.10 Salt Manufacture\nSalt manufacture through the crystallation of sea water, is an important industry in the Philippines. The quantity of salt produced annually\namounts to about 200,000 MT\n\n27\n\n, produced on about 200-250 salt farms. 29\n\nThe process employed in salt manufacturing is rather simples sea\nwater is pumped into retention tanks and as its salt concentration increases,\nthrough evaporation the liquor is transferred to smaller tanks. The latter\ntransfers are by gravity. Finally, the highly concentrated liquor is transferred to brick-lined crystallation tanks. Pumping is sometimes required at this\nstage, depending on the salt pond design. When all the water has evaporated,\nthe salt is manually scraped off the bricks and stored in a silo or sacks.\nSalt is manufactured only during the dry season, which in Iloilo, a\nmajor salt producing region, is January to May. During the wet season,\nthe salt ponds are used to cultivate backish water, such as ban s (milkfish) or prawns. An average size of a salt manufacturing facility is about\n10 ha. Currently no pumping is required for fish cultivation.\n26\n\nsureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.\n\n27 PhilippineYearbook, 1979.\n28\nDHR estimate based on average production per farm of about 600-800 MT/ha.\n\n5-29\n\n...^.^..*n . - .off-\n\n.-.r^\xc2\xb0+^ " ,^.^- . - r - ^\xe2\x80\xa2..,._r ^. *+r\n\nTABLE 5.13\n_POWER REQUIRED AND USAGE PROFILE FOR\nFISH POND OPERATION (20 HA)\n\nEquipment\t\n\nPower\t\n\nUsage Profile\n\nFour 6" axial flow pumps 5 hp gasoline \t\n\nOR\t\n\n5 hours / day (0400-0900 hours),\n3 days /week, 52 weeks/year\nAND\n\nFour 4" centrifugal pumps 10 hp diesel \t\n\nSource: DHR site visits\n\n5-30\n\n2 hours / day (1500 - 1700 hours),\n3 days /week during March to June\n\n\t\n\n,f\t\ni\n\nHowever, as mentioned previously, if stocking densities are to be increased,\nmechanical pumping will be required.\n5.10.1 Salt Pond Load Profile\n\n\t\n0\n\nA typical pumping unit required for salt manufacturing is a 6" low\nhead, high volume centrifugal pump coupled to a 10 to 15-hp diesel engine.\nThis is used to pump sea water into the first concentrating tank. Depending\non the pond layout, one or two 3" pumps coupled to 6-6 hp diesel engines can\nbe also used. These pumps are required for pumping the concentrated liquor\ninto the crystallization tanks. The small pmsps would not be used during the\nwet season for fish cultivation. Table 5.14 gives the power requirements\nand load profiles for a typical salt/fish operation.\n5.10.2 Extent of Use of Salt Manufacturing\nThe average production of salt in the Philippines is about 80-100\nMT/ha/year. Since total production of salt in 1977 was about 200,000 MT,\nthe area required for salt production is about 2000-2500 ha. Since each\nsalt farm is approximately 10 ha in size, the number of salt farms is about\n200-250. At present, there is no estimate of the expected increase in the\nnumber of salt farms in the next few years. Thus, 250 salt farms could be\nused as the upper-bound on the number of salt farms that potentially could\nuse P/V power.\n5.11 Miscellaneous Small Power Applications\nThere are many small power applications in the Philippines where photovoltaics could prove to be an ideal power source. These includes\ne Fisheries stock gathering -- Most hatcheries must collect young\nfry or specimen from the wild or ocean and then transfer thgm to\nthe hatchery. During the collection process, which is done in\nremo.e locations, power is required for pumping small amounts of\nwatear or for aeration. Currently these fractional horsepower\npumps are powered using small gasoline engines or batteries.\nProblems with the current power sources are: noisy gasoline\nengines disturb fish collection: and batteries have to be taken\ninto town for charging, resulting in significant damage to the\nbatteries due to mishandling.\ne Communication -- Most large farms and fish pond operations require\npower to operate a transceiver. Currrently these are battery powered, with the inherent problems associated with battery charging.\n5-31\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 5.14\nPOWER REQUIRED AND USAGE PROFILE FOR SALT/FISH PRODUCTION\nUsage Profile\nMay June - Decembwr\nJanua\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\n(salt)\t\ns\t\n\nEquipment\n\nPower Required\n\nFuel Consumed\n\n6 " pump\n\n10-15 hp\n\n10 liters/day\n\n5 hours/day\t\n\n5 hours/day\n\nTwo 3" pumps\n\n6-8 hp\n\n10 liters/3 days\nfor two pumps\n\n1 hour/day\t\n\n---\n\nSource: Iloilo salt farm site visits.\n\nt\n\n5-32\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 battery charging in logging sites -- At pr\xe2\x80\xa2senL considerable inconvenience is caused to logging operations in forests due to\ndischarged batteries. Loggers have to use small gasoline gonerstore for battery charging. Some are even experimenting with\nsmall wind powered battery chargers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Agricultural extension use -- Agricultural extension agents have\na need for a power source to operate their slide projectors used\nin farmer education . 29Currently, the need is met through small\ngasoline generators. Small battery powered slide projectors\nwould easily provide the same service. There are three possible\nalternatives for charging these batteries, each with their own\nadvantages and disadvantages. They are:\n-- Using grid power for charging batteries. A cheap\nalternative, but the extension agents do not always\nhave access to grid power.\n-- Using the alternator in the vehicle for battery charging.\nA feasible alternative if the vehicle alternator is increased in size. However, extension agents do not always\ndrive long enough to adequately charge the batteries.\n-- A P/V battery charger. The small array could be attached\nto the vehicle roof and could be a convenient source of\npower for charging the batteries.\nThere are other battery charging applications in the agricultural\nsector, but the above application provides an overview of the variety of\nexisting applications.\n5.11.1 Battery Charging Load Profile\nThe battery charging power requirements depend on the power requirements of the equipment and the intensity of use. Table 5.15 gives power\nrequirements and intensity of use estimates for the above applications.\n5.11.2 Extent of Use of Battery Charaers\nAn accurate estimate of the extent of ,potential market is difficult\nto make. however, an indication of market size can be gauged from the\nfollowing facts$\ne There are 302 fish hatcheries currently operating in the Philippines.\n\n29 Theflorid bank is financing the purchase of 240 projectors and gasoline\ngenerators for use by the extension agents.\n\n5-33\n\ni\ni\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 5.15\nPOWER REQUIRED AND USAGE PROFILE FOR\nBATTERY CHARGING APPLICATIONS\n\nUsage\n\nEquipment\t\n\nPower Required\t\n\n1.

They include:\ne Piggeri\xe2\x80\xa2 , -- An average sized commercia:t piggery in the Philippines\t\nAbout 50 sows. Equipment used includes a 3 hp hammermill, 3 hp mixer, 1 hp water pump, and 1 Kw of fluourescont lights.\nSince this equipment is used throughout the year, it is suitable\nfor a P/V generator. However, the P/V generator would have to\ncompete with a biogas electricity generator; thus, it is unlikely\nthat P/V would prove to be cost-competitive.\ne Abaca Strippers -- \':here are about 12,000 small, 1.5 hp gasoline\nengine driven strippers in use in the Philippines. They are used\nthroughout the year and would be ideal for use with a small 1 KW\nP/V generator. However, the machines have to be moved from field\nto field in srany instances and due to portability problems of\nP/V generators, they would not be suitable.\ne Rice Threshers -- Small rice threshers, driven by 2-3 hp gasoline\nmotors, are commonly used in the Philippines. However, the need\nto move them from field to field makes it unsuitable for use with\na P/V generator.\nThese applications would be feasible if the equipment does not have to be\nmoved frequently or moved a great distance.

At this point the market share of P/V\nwill be close to zero as the conventional systems have the advantages of\nexisting supply and repair systems, tradition, less initial capital investment and greater end-use flexibility. As the cost advantage of P/V\nover conventional systems grows so will its market share. Once the cost\nequality point for P/V is passed, their rate of penetration will be determined by other factors such as: equipment turnaround rates, awareness,\navailability of finance, marketing strategies, availability of distribution,\ninstallation, and maintenance facilities and other market related factors.\nAnother assumption made in estimating the market is that P/V systems will\nfirst penetrate into areas where users are already using mechanically or\nelectrically powered equipment. For example, P/V systems will be more\nacceptable to a farmer using a gasoline engine driven pump than one who\nirrigates the field manually.\nIn Section 6.2, the methodology used in the market size estimation\nanalysis is described briefly. Section 6.3 discusses the necessity of\nconducting an economic cost/benefit as well as financial cost/benefit\nanalysis. Section 6.4 awmarizes the market and institutional factors\nthat constitute incentives and barriers to P/V use. In Section 6.5, a\nseries of cost-competitive analyses are described. It identifies the year\nin\n\nwhich various P/V applications become equal in cost (on a life-cycle\n\nbasis) to the least expensive conventional power system. Finally, in\n\n6-1\n\nSection 6.6, an annual potential market size estimate is obtained for\n1982 through 1990.\n6.2 Market Size Estimation Methodology\nMarket size estimates are developed in two stages. In Stage 1, the\nlife-cycle cost of P/V systems is compared to its nearest conventional\npower system for a variety of applications. For example, for applications\nrequiring a power capacity of about 1 KW or less, the competitor is assumed\nto be gasoline driven generators. For larger systems, the competitor is\ndiesel driven generators. The life-cycle costs of P/V systems and the\ncompeting conventional systems are calculated on an annual system purchase\nbasis, from 1980 to 1990. Since the P/V array and balance of system costs\nare steadily decreasing and conventional system and fuel costs are increasing, at some point in time the costs became equal. That is to say, when\ncosts became equal, a P/V system installed in that year costs as much as\na conventional system installed in the same year, as measured on a lifecycle basis. Thus, the analysis enables one to determine the year when\nP/V systems first became competitive with the competing conventional systems.\nIn the next stage, the upper bound on the P/V market (defined by the extent\nof use of various applications) is modified by the equipment turnaround\nrates, financing availability and other factors to obtain an estimate of\nthe possible annual sales of P/V systems in the Philippines. Due to the\ninherent uncertainties prevalent in such predictions, we provide three market\nsize estimates: "most likely", "increased activity" and "optimistic", and\ntheir definitions are described later.\n6.2.1 Cost Analysis\nThe cost analyses are based on accepted life-cycle costing principles.\nBoth a financial and an economic life-cycle cost analysis are conducted\ndue to the reasons explained in Section 6.3.\n6-2\n\nTo reflect inherent uncertainties prevalent in predicting future\ntrends, several scenarios are considered.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Financial analysis using a real fuel cost escalation of 16% per\nyear for gasoline and 10 \xe2\x99\xa6 per year for diesel. This corresponds\nto historical escalation rates from 1975 to 1980. 1 For each case,\ntwo loan rates of 21% and 14% are used. The former corresponds\nto the current cowercial bank rate and the latter to the development bank loan rate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Financial analysis using a real fuel cost escalation of 3\xe2\x80\xa2 per\nyear for gasoline and diesel and a loan rate of 14%.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Economic analysis using a real discount rate of 12\xe2\x80\xa2 and a real\nfuel cost escalation rate of 3s per year. These rates were\nrecommended for use by Dr. Mohan Munasinghe, Energy Economist,\nThe World Bank, Washington, D.C.\nThe methodology used for the analyses and the input data assumption are\ndescribed in Appendex E.\n6.2.2 Market Size Estimation\nP/V market size estimation methodologies that use current and projected\ngasoline and diesel generator sales as an indicator of possible P/V sales can be\nmisleading. For example, in the Philippines most large diesel driven generators\nare used to provide back-up power in the case of grid power failure. Furthermore,\nin many agricultural applications, gasoline and diesel engines are directly\ncoupled to equipment, without the need for an electricity generator. Thus,\nin this study, generator sales are not an adequate indicator since they do not\ntake into account a large segment of the feasible agricultural sector market.\nOur "bottom-up" approach begi,.s by estimating the upper-bound of the\npotential market. The upper-bound is defined as the peak power required for\nthe total number of cost competitive, practical applications. The upper-bound\nis modified by the new equipment installation rate to obtain an estimate of\n\n1 This assumption implies that the extraordinary fuel cost escalation from\n1975 to 1980 will continue. At 10 \xe2\x99\xa6 and 16% real fuel cost escalation, a\nbarrel costing $40 in 1980 will cost in 1990 (in constant dollars) $104\nand $176 respectively.\n6-3\n\n6\n\nthe applications that may be installed in a particular year. The modified\npotential market is then further reduced to reflect other constraints to\nc\n\nachieving the potential market. These include awareness * financing, institutional barriers, and other market related factors.\n6.3 Need for Financial and Economic Cost/Benefit Analysis\n\n^a\nLong-term financing of photovoltaic systems is likely to be handled\nthrough the government financial system. Host long-term financing in agriculture is directed through the development banks, which are in turn partially\nfinanced through multi-lateral donor agencies, such as the Asian Development\nBank and the world Bank and bilateral agreements between the Philippines\nand donor countries. These banks function not only as lending agencies but\nalso as agents of government policy objectives. This dual function creates\nthe need within the development banks to evaluate loans in terms of their\neconomic benefits to the nation as well as their benefits to the potential\napplicant. The World Bank has been instrumental in developing a methodology\nfor the evaluation of economic benefits to the nation from investment projects. Most development banks financed by the world Bank have been encouraged\nto adopt this economic analysis of projects as a part of their lending evaluations in addition to the more traditional, business-oriented, financial\nanalysis.2\nInterviews with the Development Bank of the Philippines\' planners indicated that the bank will, in the future, adopt the economic analysis of\nprojects as part of their evaluation of loans. Once this practice has been\ninstituted, loans will be given according to the following criteria:\ne Loans would be given if projects pass both and economic and financial analysis.\n\ndetails on the World Bank economic analysis methodology soot Lyn\nire and Herman G. Van Der Tak, Economic Analysis of Projects, the\nns Hopkins University Press, 1975.\n6-4\n\ni\n\ni\n\ne e If a project passes an economic analysis and not a financial\nanalysis, it would be sore likely to receive funding than if\nit passes a financial analysis and tails an economic analysis.\ni Finally, if a project fails both an economic analysis and\nfinancial analysis it will not receive funding.\nConsidering that most long-term agricultural financing in the\nPhilippines is presently directed through the Development Bank of the\nPhilippines, American photovoltaic firms wishing to sell in the future\nto the government or to government-financed projects may have to justify\non economic grounds the viability of these systems. DHR, in considering\npotential photovoltaic applications, has included in its evaluation of\nphotovoltaic systems both an economic and a financial analysis. The\npurpose of using both types of economic evaluation is to provide photovoltaic manufacturers with an idea of the economics under which these\nsystems will be financed by the Development Bank of the Philippines.\nBriefly, an economic analysis is defined here as an attempt to value\nthe contribution to the country\'s basic socioeconomic objectives made by\na project. In practice, an economic analysis involves the use of prices\nfor goods and services that are free from distortions in the marketplace\nand reflect the real, economic value of the good. For example, price of\ngasoline at the National Philippine Oil Corporation refinery cutlet is ($1.18\nper gallon, including wholesale markup). Taxes and duties have raised this\nprice to ($2.42 per gallon) and have distorted the market for gasoline.3\nIn an economic analysis, the price of $1.18 per gallon would be used in the\nevaluation of the costs/benefits of a gasoline engine. This approach differs\nfrom a financial analysis that would use the higher price inclusive of taxes\n\n3 The prices are as of August 15, 1980. The corresponding diesel prices\nare as follows: Refinery Outlet: $1.18 per gallon (including wholesale\nmarkup)i Retails $1.43 per gallon.\n\n6-S\n\nand duties. To a businessman, the latter approach is much sore valuable\nthan the forcer. However, to a development planner the economic analysis\nwould be relatively more important. DHR\'s analysis is not intended to be\na primer on economic analysis of projects. It is directed at illustrating\nthe potential changes that could occur in the market for photovoltaics as\na result of using a different methodology for economic evaluation. In\ngeneral, it can be said that the economic analysis of projects will tend to delay\nintroduction of photovoltaic systems into the marketjlace. Further details\nwill be provided on the factors that influence the economic analysis of\nphotovoltaics in the next section.\n6.4 Summary of Incentives and Barriers to P/V Use in Agriculture\nThe pur pose of this section is to summarize DHR\'s perceptions as to the\nmajor non-economic incentives and constraints to P/V use in Philippines agriculture. The Philippines offers a mixed bag of incentives and disincentives\nfor the use of photovoltaics in agriculture. On one hand, the government\noffers a number of financial incentives designed to spur the introduction\nand use of non-conventional energy technologies (including P/V) into Philippine society, while on the other hand, there are a variety of business and\nfinancial practices that will act as constraints on the development of a\nP/V market. For American P/V manufacturers, these constraints center on:\n1) the lack of long-term capital in the agricultural sector that could be used\nto finance P/V products; 2) the possibility of foreign competition particularly from\nGerman, Japanese and i\'rench P/V manufacturers; 3) potential service/maintenance problems for BOS components that require skilled labor or storage of\nhigh value parts; 4) existing credit arrangements between dealers/wholesalers/\nmanufacturers; and finally 5) the degree of awareness and lack of information\non behalf of end-users and skepticism by planners and policy makers about P/V.\n\n=y\t\n\n6-6\n;\n. t\n\n:\t\n\n4\n\n4\n\nA\t\n\ni\nt\n\nA a wary of current Philippine business/financial practices is provided in Table 6.1 with DHR\'a perception of the relative degree of constraint/\n3\nincentive for each of the practices identified. Further detail on each\nk\t\n\nconstraint/incentive can be found within the text.\nIn developing a market for photovoltaic& in the Philippines, the constraints, particularly the lack of long-term capital, will outweigh the incentives given for photovoltaic use. The high initial capital costs for\nphotovoltaic systems coupled with the shortage of long-term loans would\nprevent many consumers who would be interested in P/V systems from purchasing\nthese systems. DHR feels that the present inadequacy of long-term capital\nin the Philippines is the single most important impediment to the development\nof the P/V market.\n6.5 Cost Analyses\nThe financial and economic cost analyses are based on methods, assumptions and data currently being used by the Filipino financial community in\n\ni\nassessing the feasibility of agriculture sector capital investments. The\ne\ninput to the analyses are described in detail in Appendix E. Also described\nin the same appendix is the power required and energy usage profile for the\napplications described in the previous chapter.\nTable 6.2 shows the results of the financial analyses real fuel escalation\nrates of 16% (gasoline) and 10% (diesel) in two cases: commercial bank loan\nrates of 21% and development bank loan rate of 14%. The table indicates the peak array size necessary to supply the energy required for varions applications, the first year in which the P/V system becomes equal\nin cost with its closest competitor, and the life-cycle cost per Kwh in\nthe first year of cost-competitiveness (in nominal dollars). For example,\nin scenario 1, 0.8 KW (capacity) standard case requires 1.77 KWp array and\n\n6-7\n\nTABLE 6.1\n1\ni\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT/FINANCIAL BARRIERS,\nCONSTRAINTS AND INCENTIVES TO PHOTOVOLTAICS\n\nt\nArea\t\n\nPresent Status\t\n\nDegree of\nConstraints/incentives\nTowards Photovoltaic&\n\n1.0 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n1.1 Dealer/Importer/Manufacturer Relationship\n\nNo effect\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dealers often act as exclusive agents for products.\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sales are on indent basis. \t\n\n1.2 Service/Maintenance\n\nterm ri.-ge up to\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Credit ter\n60 days for small \xe2\x80\xa2quipment-installment payment terms for\nlarge items (25% deposit, twoyear monthly installments.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dealers do not usually\t\nstock\'high value parts. \t\n\nNo effect\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintenance of small Sys-\t\nterns left to purchaser--\t\nlarge systems serviced by\ndealer.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Warranty terms are one and \t\ntwo years normally. \t\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\na Current shortage of skilled \t\nworkers.\t\n\nSmall\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 End-users are highly price \t\nsensitive to first cost\t\n\nLarge\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low dealer margins on some \t\ntypes of electrical gener-\t\nating equipment.\n\nSmall\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 P/V installation costs can \t\nbe fully deductible in year \t\nincurred.\nampstition\n\nSmall\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Manufacturer/dealers sell- \t\ning to government or gov- \t\nernment-financed projects\nmust be accredited.\n\n1.3 Product Pricing\n\nSmall\ndisadvantage\n\nLarge\nadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 U.S. leads in motor genera- \t\nfor set field.\t\n\nSmall\nadvantage\n\n6-6\n\nr^\n\nTABLE 6.1 (contd.)\n\nArea\t\n\nPresent Status\n\nDegree of\nConstraints/Incentives\nTowards Photovoltaic*\n\n9 Strong cm \t tition by surepeans and Japanese in alternators and motor market.\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\ne Australian, French, German\nand Japanese are interested\nor are currently developing\nP/V market.\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\ne Local P/V industry may\ndevelop in near future.\n\nsmall\ndisadvantage\n\na P/V designated pioneer indus-\t\ntry.\n\nLarge\nadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Government offers a number of\t\nfinancial incentives to mane- \t\nfacturers to site plants in\nthe Philippines.\n\nLarge\nadvantage\n\n1.6 Standards and Regula-\t\ntions\t\n\na Generally, all U.S. stand-\t\nards are acceptable.\t\n\nSmall\nadvantage\n\n1.7 Tariffs and Taxes\t\n\na P/V exempted from all taxes. \t\n\nModerate\nadvantage\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\n1.5\t\n\nInvestment Climate\t\n\ne Bos systems would have import\t\nduties and taxes levied.\t\n2.0 FINANCIAL PRACTICES\n\n2.3 Long-Term Investment\t\nCapital\t\n\nNo effect\n\nNo effect\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Skepticism at project staff \t\nlevel.\t\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\ne Enthusiasm at program staff \t\nlevel.\t\n\n2.2 Attitudes to P/V\t\n\na Government-run financial sys-\t\ntem would provide long-term\nfinancing for energy projects\n-- my evaluate projects on\neconomic basis.\ne Privately-owned financial\t\nsystem provides short-term\nworking capital (seed, fuel\nfertility, etc.)--would\nevaluate projects on financial basis.\n\n2.1 Role and Responsibilities \t\nof Financial Institutions\t\n\nSmall\nadvantage\n\na Long-term loans are primarily\t\nfrom government development \t\nbanks.\n\nModerate\ndisadvantage\n\n6-9\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 6.1 (cont\'d.)\n\nArea\t\n\nPresent Status\t\n\nDegree of\nConstraints/incentives\nTowards Photovoltaic@\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Total long-term capital\t\navailable for agriculture \t\nis small.\n\nLarge\ndisadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Priority for renewable energy\t\nprojects in government-run\t\nfinancial institutions\' lending\nprograms.\n\nSmall\nadvantage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Competition of P/V for loans\t\nModerate\nagainst biogas and biomass pro- disadvantage\njects.\n2.4 Loan Terms for Long-Term\nLoans\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Interest rates between 12%-14%.

Most applications beccros cost-competitive\nonly arcuud 1984-65. All applications became cost-competitive before .1987,\nusing the P/V system costs assumed in Appendix E. The effect of the lower\nloan rate can be clearly seen in Table 6.2. In almost all cases which become\ncost-competitive after 1960, the lower loan rate enables P/V to become costcompetitive a year or two earlier.\nThe effect of the variation in peak power requirements and application\ntype on the first year of cost-competitiveness can be clearly seen in Figures\n6.1 and 6.2.\nTable 6.3 shows similar results for the economic and financial analyses using a three percent real fuel cost escalation rate. Comparison of the\nresults shows how economic cost/benefit analysis tends to make P/V systems less\nfavorable. This is mainly due to reduced cost of fuel caused by the removal\nof all fuel taxes and duties. in general, cost competitiveness occurs in a\nsignificant number of applications in 1988 and later. The corresponding\nfinancial w slysis is much more favorable and significant number of applic.:^ions\nbecome cost-competitive in and around 1985-86. Thus, P/V systems fall into\nthe category of investments whic\'a are financially, bLi; not economically viable.\nAccording tc DBP policies, financing of P/V systems is uncertain. Financing\nwould be possible and encouraged if, as required by Presidental Decree, DS\'\nhas to give additional incantives to renewable energy systems.

They were:\nAwareness -- There is, in general, a lack of awareness among endusers, private and public banking communities, and government\ndecision-makers as to the possibilities for P/V use.\ne Cost-Competitiveness -- P/V systems must be cost-competitive with\nthe least cost, practical alternative, on a life-cycle basis before\nP/V use will be seriously contemplated.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Financial -- The Philippines is faced with a serious capital\nconstraint. Consequently, only a few institutions currently\nmake long-term loans to the agricultural sector.\n6.6.1 Scenario Definition\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nOur approach to estimating the market size evaluates each of the above\ncriteria and provides three estimates (status quo, increased activity and optimistic); namely, number of cost-competitive applications or finance, based\non the tightest constraint.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "Status No" scenario assumes that the current status quo is maintained\nand fuel costs have a low escalation rate. That is, the barriers and incentives summarized in Section 6.4, continue to be relevant and applicable in\nthe future.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "Increased Activity" scenario assumes greater government interest,\nadditional government financing, aggressive marketing by P/V companies, considerable end-user interest and awareness, low (3%) real fuel escalation\nrates, and self-financing by larger operations in addition to the incentives\nassumed in previous cases.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "Optimistic" scenario assumes a definite government commitment\ntowards P/V, priority government financing, very strong end-user interest,\nsmaller operations entering the market, the private financial community funding for P/V systems and historical fuel cost escalation rates, in addition to\nthe assumptions described in the previous scenario.\n6-18\n\nf\nr\n\nIn Section 6.6.2, market estimates based on cost-competitiveness are\nmade assuming no shortage of capital. In Section 6.6.3, market estimates\nbased on capital constraints are made. The set of market size estimates that\nare more constrained will be used as the DHR\'s best estimate for P/V use in\nPhilippines agriculture.\n6.6.2 Market Estimate Based on Cost-Competitiveness\nTable 6.4 shows the upper bound on P/V power requirements based on the\nfinancial and economic analysis described in Section 6.4. The power requirements were calculated by multiplying the number of cost-competitive\napplications by the peak power requirements per unit. It shows the demand\nfor P/V power in MWp if all cost-competitive applications began using P/V\nsystems. While this table indicates an upper-bound, it cannot be used to\ndetermine the number of possible P/V conversions in a given year since a\ntotal one-time conversion is impractical.\nA better indicator is to assume that equipment being installed in a\nparticular year could be considered for P/V conversion. An indication of\nannual conversion rates may be obtained by examining the actual number of\nagricultural equipment in use and the expected annual sales as projected\nby AMMDA. In most cases, equipment installed per year (equipment turn-over\nplus new installations) amounts to about 10% of the existing stock. For\nthe purposes of estimating a P/V market share, we assume that 10% of equipment installed will use P/V.

Capital availability estimates are\nshorn in Table 6.6. The estimates reflect the fact that there is a significant\n"learning" or awareness problem associate3 with P/V use and until that barrier\nis broken, no significant amounts of P/V systems will be installed. DHR\nestimates that it will be at least 1985 before this barrier is minimized.\nOn the more positive side, it is assumed that most small applications,\ncurrently cost-competitive, will be purchased by the more affluent users.\nThese include transceivers, logging operation battery chargers, maintenance\nyard power supply, forestry stations, and prawn hatcheries. In most cases,\nthe amount of capital required is well within the resources of the users (for\nexample, annual revenue from a prawn hatchery is about $60,000). The small\napplications used by the more affluent groups amount to about S.5 MWp of power\nfor the financial analyses cases and about 1 MWp for the economic analysis\ncase. The data in Table 6.6 reflects only financing available from Filipino\nsources for commercial use of P/V and does not take into account foreign funds\nsupplied for demonstration projects. Estimation of funds available for the\nlatter activities is fraught with even greater uncertainties. Thus, making\nsuch estimates would be fruitless. Table 6.7 shows quantity of P/V systems\nthat can be installed for financing levels in Table 6.6. This is based on\nP/V system costa shown in Table 3 in Appendix E.\n\n1 The total 1977 long-term financing in the Philippine agriculture sector\nwas approximately $60 million.\n\n6-21\n\nTABLE 6.5\nMARKET SIZE ESTIMATIONS BASED ON COST - COMPETITIVENESS CRITERIA (KWp)\n\nSCENARIO\n\nWx\n\nMost Likely\t\nYear\n\nAnnual\t\n\nCumulative\t\n\nIncrease Activitv\nAnnual\t\n\nCumulative\n\nOptimistic\nAnnual\t\n\nCumulative\n\n1982\n\n10\t\n\n10\t\n\n90\t\n\n90\n\n90\t\n\n90\n\n1983\n\n10\t\n\n20\t\n\n90\t\n\n180\n\n450\t\n\n540\n\n1984\n\n10\t\n\n30\t\n\n700\t\n\n880\n\n1,300\t\n\n1,840\n\n1985\n\n10\t\n\n40\t\n\n2,000\t\n\n2,880\n\n2,200\t\n\n4,040\n\n1986\n\n90\t\n\n130\t\n\n2,000\t\n\n4,380\n\n2,300\t\n\n6,340\n\n1987\n\n80\t\n\n210\t\n\n11900\t\n\n6,780\n\n2,700\t\n\n9,040\n\n1988\n\n530\t\n\n740\t\n\n2,600\t\n\n9,380\n\n2,700\t\n\n11,740\n\n1989\n\n520\t\n\n1,260\t\n\n2,500\t\n\n11,880\n\n2,700\t\n\n14,440\n\n1990\n\n2,000\t\n\n3,260\t\n\n2,500\t\n\n11,380\n\n2,700\t\n\n17,140\n\nNOTE:\n\n1) Above figures reflect a market share of 10\xe2\x80\xa2 of cumulative\nequipment installed up to a given year, less conversion to\nP/V in previous years.\n\n2) As a comparison, AMMDA estimates that sales of small gasoline engines (average 5 hp) for agricultural uses is expected to be about 30,000 to 40,000 a year till 1985.\t This is\nequivalent to above 245 MWp /year (at 7 KWp - 5 hp)!\t Since\nthe average cost of the engines is about $400, the total\nThe equivalent cost\nexpenditure is above $14 million/year.\nof P/V systems at the 1985 array price is $2 billion, and\nthe quantity of P/V arrays purchasable for $14 million\namounts to 1.8 MWp at the 1985 price of $7.78/wp (1980 $)\nof arrays.\n\nn\n\n3) 7KWp - 5 hp R 0.746 KW /hp * 8 hours/day /(4.3 peak sunlight\nhours/day).\nt\n\n6-22\n\nTABLE 6.6\nDHR ESTIMATES OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE FOR\nFINANCING P/V SYSTEMS IN THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR\nE\n\nCapital Available from Private and Public\nFilipino Sources (1000 \'s of 1980\t $)\n3CENARIO\n\nYear\n\nMost Likely\n\n1981\n\nNS*\n\n1982\n\n20\n\n200\n\n500\n\n1983\n\n40\n\n600\n\n1000\n\n1984\n\n60\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n1985\n\n120\n\n1600\n\n2100\n\n1986\n\n200\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n1987\n\n300\n\n2200\n\n3200\n\n1988\n\n500\n\n2500\n\n4700\n\n1989\n\n700\n\n3000\n\n6800\n\n1990\n\n1000\n\n4000\n\n10,000\n\nNS\n\nw\t\n\n^\n\nIncreased Activity\n\nNS\n\nnot significant\n\n6-23\n\nOptimistic\nNS\n\nTABLE 6.7\nDNR MARKET SIZE ESTIMATES BASED ON FINANCE AVAILABILITY (XWP)\nSCENARIO\nMost Likely\nYear\n\nAnnual\n\n1981\n\n\xe2\x80\xa22\n\n1983\n\nCumulative\n\n-\n\n1982\n\nIncreased Activity\nAnnual\n\nCumulative\n\noptimistic\nAnnual\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n17\n\n17\n\n43\n\n43\n\n4\n\n6\n\n57\n\n74\n\n96\n\n139\n\n1984\n\n7\n\n13\n\n109\n\n183\n\n164\n\n303\n\n1985\n\n15\n\n28\n\n204\n\n387\n\n268\n\n571\n\n1986\n\n31\n\n59\n\n305\n\n692\n\n382\n\n953\n\n1987\n\n51\n\n110\n\n338\n\n1030\n\n540\n\n1493\n\n1988\n\n95\n\n205\n\n473\n\n1503\n\n890\n\n2383\n\n1989\n\n151\n\n356\n\n647\n\n2150\n\n1466\n\n3849\n\n1990\n\n250\n\n606\n\n1000\n\n3150\n\n2500\n\n6349\n\nr\n\nf\n\nt,\nrt\n\n6-24\n\n-\n\nCumulative\n-\n\nW\n\nMA\n\n6.7 Conclusions\nIF,\t\n\nif the present business practices continue, the market for P/V power\n\nsystems in the Philippines agricultural sector Will be small.\nimportant limiting factor is the limited availability of capital financing\nfor P/V systems. if this constraint could be relaxed, then the cost-effective\nmarket becomes larger by several orders of magnitude. Thus, devising innova-\n\ntive financing schemes and promotional campaigns could have a wry high payoff. The market would be mainly small power applications in the pre-1985\nperiod with sales to affluent individuals or corporations. In the post-1985\nperiod, MIR speculates that the market for larger systems would open up with\nlong-term financing provided by the Philippine banking community.\nAs a cOMWison of Table 6.5 and 6.7 clearly shows, capital availability\nwould be the most constraining factor determining market size. Thus, the\nmarket estimates in Table 6.7 would be representative of what can be expected\nin terms of P/V system sales in the Philippine agriculture sector.\nAdditionally, there are many characteristics of the Philippine agricultural and energy sectors that will influence the market for P/V systems.\nAmong the most favorable factors are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Stated government policy towards promotion of renewable, and\ndispersed power sources.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Financial incentives for the production and use of P/V systems.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High cost of conventional energy supplies such as gasoline and\ndiesel.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Entrepreneurial interest in P/V systems.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cost-competitiveness of P/V systems when coWared to gasoline and\ndiesel power sources in a wide range of agricultural applications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Availability of suitable marketing channels for sale of P/V\nsystems in the agricultural sector.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The shortage of skilled labor for maintaining ca geting gasoline\nand diesel powered systems.\n6-zs\n\n\t\n\nHowever, very significant and serious barriers prevent achieving the technically feasible, cost-competitive market for P/V systems in the agricultural\nsector. These includes The lack of awareness of the possibilities for P/V\nsystemst high first costs of P/V when c=Wared to competing systems; and,\nthe inadequacy of long term capital for financing P/V systems.\n\nv\n\nI\t\n\nt\nL\n\ne\n\n6-26\na\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7.0 DUSIVE" ENVIRONMENT\n7\xe2\x80\x9e1 Level of Public Awareness\nThe OHR team estimated that only about 20 percent of the individuals\ncontacted and interviewed had any substantial knowledge about P/V systems.\nHowever, within the agricultural sector and related organizations or\nagencies contacted by the team, the level crf awareness was higher, as\nalmost all organizations or agencies had one or more persons who were aware\nof what P/V systems were and how they can generally be utilized for power.\nA higher level of awareness and sophistication about P/V systems was found\nin several key agencies outside the Ministry of Energy. For exaWles in\nthe Ministry of Agriculture, the National Grains Authority, and the National\nirrigation Administration people had bcen considering possible applications\nand haj, therefore, educated themselves about P/V systems. However, in most\ninstances where there was such a high level of awareness, the people were\nprofessionals who were actively involved in trying to solve energy problems\nin the agriculture, fisheries, or forestry sectors. \t\nt\nIn summary, the OHR team found that although general awareness was\nlow, that in almost all agencies or organizations it was not difficult to\nfind individuals who had some general knowledge of P/V systems.\nAs a result of extensive meetings with all of the major gown-anent\nagencies related to agriculture (and, therefore having important relationships\nto the future of P/V systems in the Philippines -- see Appendix A), the aHR\nteam felt that there is certainly a strong interest in P/V systems among\nthese government agencies. Even in those instances where awareness was not\nhigh, a simple P/V demonstration or explanation by the OHR team usually resalted in a strong interest to explore P/V possibilities. However, there is\nnot yet a concentrated or strong effort to adopt or utilize P/V systems.\nPresent interest is mainly confined to the demonstration level.\n7-1\n\nE\n\nA number of officials were able to identify initial application where\nP/V systems could be employed---for example, in agency communication systems\nor in field extension operations related to research and development activities. Int"est in research and testing of various applications for example,\nin water pumping, powering fans for dryers, or multiple-use applications.\nInterest also exists for uses such as charging remote batteries, powering\nremote communication equipment, or running media equipment.\nIn moving beyuiv" expurimentation and demonstration, people, especially\nthose involved in energy work within agencies, become skeptical as to the\nappropriateness or match of P/V to their needs. It was repeatedly mentioned\nto the DHR team that their major concern or reservation was based on the high\npresent market cost of P/V systems. This seems to be the key inhibitor to\na more widespread and higher level of interest necessary to move beyond demonstrations. People in the Philippines are taking a wait-and-see attitude\ntoward i\'/V. An improvement in the relative cost of P/V to competing energy\nsources will address this\n\ninhibiting factor,\n\nand create an atmosphere and\n\npossibility of increased interest. At that time, it will be possible to\naddress remaining concerns about P/V performance (e.g., reliability and durability) that can\n\nonly cane\n\nwith user experience\n\nin the\n\nfield.\n\n7.2 Entrepreneurial Interest\nThere is currently an active and enthusiastic entrepreneurial interest\nin photovoltaics by Filipino businessmen. In interviews\n\nwiW both\n\nlarge\n\nand small industrialists, there was the attitude that photovoltaics could\ndevelop as a viable energy industry in the Philippines. Both a large industrial corporation and a large commercial bank have expressed interest\n\n`\t\n\nTo protect the confidentiality of DHR sources, this section presents a\ngeneral overview of DHR impressions of Philippine entrepreneurial interest\nin photovoltaics.\n\nr\n7-2\n\n10f\nr\n\nin financing economically viable photovoltaic projects, as well as establishing a local photovoltaic industry. Smaller firms, presently involved in\nselling flat plate solar collectors, have also expressed an interest in\nestablishing contact with American photovoltaic manufacturers with the purposes\nof either establishing joint manufacturing ventures or marketing of photovoltaic systems.\nIn general, the level of knowledge and sophistication about potential\napplications, markets and photovoltaic systems is high in larger firms. In\naddition, larger firms appeared to be interested in technology transfer\narrangements with the United States, while smaller entrepreneurs expressed\na willingness to act as dealers for photvoltaic systems. A number of entrepreneurs, both large and small, inquired about the possibility of setting up\na regional production facility in the Philippines to service the ASEAN marlet (Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines). These\nentrepreneurs felt that\n\nit may be possible to obtain preferential tariff\n\nduties on an ASEAN photovoltaic facility from the ASEAN community. One firm\nhas advertised small photovoltaic systems in Philippine newspapers. These\nsystems were designed to power radios and electric fans and geared to the\nupper-middle and upper class market. To date this businessmen has not\nbeen able to penetrate this market successfully. One problem (often\ncited by businessmen) is the fact that potential customers are familiar with\nmuch larger systems. For example, farmers irrigating their fields commonly\nuse 4"-6" pumps coupled to 5 to 10 hp gasoline or diesel engines. Smaller\nphotovoltaic systems (below lXW) are viewed with sketpicism by farmers who\nfeel that P/V cannot irrigate as large an area as a gasoline or a diesel\n\n7-3\n\nFinally, there have been a number of foreign and American firms that\ni.\nhave sold photovoltaic systems to the Philippines Hon-Conventional Energy\nCenter and the Philippines Armed Forces for demonstration and testing purposes. Satisfaction with these systems sold to the government and private\nsectors appeared to be high.\n7.3 Overview of Philippine Business Practices in the Electric Generation\nand Transmission &iuipment Areas\nThe bulk of electric generating and transmission equipment sold in\nthe Philippines flows either directly from manufacturers to end-users or\nfrom manufacturers through importer/dealers to end-users. There is also\nwholesale/retail distribution of small electrical items such as switches\nand low-voltage wire, but this distribution constitutes a small portion of\ntotal market value.\nIn the case of imported items, importer/dealers most often act as\nexclusive agents for overseas suppliers and promote the products to endusers. In some cases the importer/dealers will keep stock of items but in\nmost instances, particularly for high-value items, sales are on an indent\nbasis: the importer/dealer makes payment to the overseas supplier and then\ncollects from the customer, or the customer opens a letter of credit, or\nsome other form of payment to the overseas supplier with the overseas\nsupplier reserving a commission for the local importer/dealer. Foreigners\ncannot own retail operations in the Philippines; but can wholesale their\nproducts.\nCredit terms are normally up to 60 days for small equipment items while\nfor large items installment payment terms are often arranged which include\n\n4\n\nNote that a substantial portion of this information has teen taken from\n"Energy Systems Equipment Market Research in the Philippines." Mobius\nResearch, May 1979,and verified through interviews by the DHR project staff.\n\ne\n7-4\n\nto=ms of 25% deposit with the remainder payable in monthly installsients\nover a 2-year period.\nWarranty terms normally range between one and two years. For example,\nin the case of diesel generating sets, typical warranty torsos would be two\nyears for standby units and one year for primary power use. Such a\nwarranty would include parts and labor for repairs arising from equipment\nfaults.\nService is a very important factor in sales of equipment in the\nPhilippines, particularly service and spare parts facilities outside the\nGreater Manila Area. End-users favor dealers who have a plentiful and easily\navailable supply of spare parts in addition to availability of workers\ncapable of undertaking the repairs. For smaller generating systems, service\nis often left to the end-user or to the myriad of small electrical/mechanical\nrepair shops that exist in the larger towns. Larger systems will be\nserviced either by the wholesaler or retailer of these systems. It should\nbe noted that a recent Presidential decree has required all firms that\n\t\nsell equipment to the government or to projects financed by the government\nto maintain a service department and a supply of spare parts that is\ncapable of maintaining all equipment that is sold. Many distributors are\ncurrently finding a shortage of skilled mechanics as a consequence of this\nregulation.\nEnd-users tend to be highly price sensitive and often a price difference\nof It in comparable products will result in the purchase of the cheaper unit.\nThe Japanese have recognized this price sensitivity and have allowed their\ndealers only a 3% mark-up on the cost of the system in order to capture a\nlarger proportion of the market. The Philippine government does try to\nencourage the local production of electrical generation equipment by allowing\nusually a 10\xe2\x80\xa2 premium on these systems before selecting the cheaper unit.\n\n7-5\n\nkj\n\nrr\n7.4 Current Generation Equipment Competition\nPresently, U.S. suppliers lead in the motor generator set field, which\nmay be an advantage to American photovoltaic manufacturers. The three major\nsuppliers are Caterpillar, GM Detroit Diesel and Cummins. Their long history\nin the market, good service organisations and extensive availability of spare\n\nparts puts them in the lead. The sales of those firms are concentrated in\nthe range of diesel generator sets below 1,000 KW, which constitute the bulk\nof the market. For diesel sets above 1,000 KW, major suppliers include European firms such as Mirrlees Blackstone, MAN, and Pielstick mainly because these\nfirms are able to arrange financing for end-uers. In the very small generator set range, gasoline engines are used. Leading suppliers for that range\ninclude Briggs z Stratton, Honda, and Wisconsin. DHR has found that in the\nagricultural sector, the near term competition is most likely to be gasoline\nengines rather than gasoline generators, particularly in irrigation/pumping\napplications.\nIt is common for alternators and motors to be imported separately and\nassembled locally for tariff purposes. Leading alternator suppliers include\nDelco of the U.S., Hawker-Siddley, Brush, and Stanford of the United Kingdom.\nLeading motor suppliers, in addition to Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel and Cummins, include Ford and Lister, both from the United Kingdom, Hercules of the\nU.S., Slanzi of Italy and MAN of West Germany. British suppliers have a\nstrong position in the market as a result of their long history of market\npromotion and frequent visits by their representatives. German motors are\nknown for their quality and reliability. Italian suppliers enter the market\nby quoting competitive prices and liberal credit terms. The Board of Invest-\n\nment (DOI) has also given permission for two firms, Izuzu Motor Co. and West\nGermany\'s MAN to manufacture all ranges of diesel engines in the Philippines.\n\n7-6\n\nV\n\n7.5 Foreign P/v c\'rmo*tition\nAustralian, French, German and Japanese firms have approached local\nentrepreneurs as to their interest in photovoltaic systems. The French\ncurrently have two small 200 watt demonstration systems located in the\nProvince of Bulacan outside of Manila:\' These demonstrations are under the\nauspices of the United Nations Development Program in cooperation with the\nPhilippine\'s Non-Conventional Energy Center and the Farm System Development\nCorporation. The German government has proposed a $4 million photovoltaic\nsystem for the Province of Illocos del *forte for electrifying a village.\nAn agreement in principal has been worked out between the German government,\nthe Non-Conventional Energy Center and the Technology Resource Center.\nThe system is expected to be in place by the and of 1981. AEG-Telefunken\nwill supply the photovoltaic system and train Filipino technicians to operate\nand maintain the system. An Australian firm is selling used American\nsolar panels to a Filipino entrepreneur.\nIn addition to foreign competitors, American photovoltaic manufacturers\nmay also in the future face local Filipino competition. A large, local, industrial firm and a large commercial bank have expressed interest-in investing in\nAmerican photovoltaic firms and establishing an indigenous photovoltaic industry based on American technology. A number of smaller firms and entrepreneurs\nalso expressed an interest in joint ventures with American firms primarily in\nthe importatic,^ of photovoltaic systems. These entrepreneurs have also a p\n-proachedforeignphotvltaicmanufctureswith eposibltyoflca mnufacture of photovoltaic systems.\n*An additional two P /V pumps were supplied by an American manufacturer.\n\n7-7\n\n1\n\nEI{\t\nOf the dealers interviewed, those presently carrying American motor\ngenerator sets appeared to be willing to retail American photovoltaic systems. \t\nHowever, to remain competitive in the field nearly all retailers expressed\nthe belief that American firms must offer liberal credit terms and low dealer\nmargins to prevent the Japanese or Europeans from taking over and controlling the\nmarket. The advantages of using these dealers as part of a Philippine\nmarketing effort is that they are 1) familiar with the electric generation\nmarket, 2) familiar in dealing with American firms, and 3) usually have\na trained core of service representatives knowledgeable about electric\nrepair.\n7.6 Climate for Investment\nThe Philippine government has accorded the local manufacture of\nphotovoltaic systems "pioneer industry" status. All projects under this status:\n\n"...shall be accorded priority by all government-owned\nor controlled financing institutions such as, but not\nlimited to, the Central Bank of the Philippines,\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines, Philippine National\nBank and applications for financial assistance submitted\nfor these projects shall be given preferential consideration in the matter of collateral requirements, rediscounting and other requirements in order to facilitate\nthe early establishment of the projects. Furthermore,\ncosts incurred in the establishment and construction of\nnon-conventional energy conversion facilities or equipment\nduly certified by the Ministry of Energy# may, at the option\nof the taxpayer, be directly chargeable to expenses and\nshall be fully deductible as such from gross income in\nthe year wherein such expenses were incurred."\n\nIn addition to the above, there are also a number of incentives regarding\nFilipino equity, tax exemptions, remittance of profits, etc. that result in\n\nSource: Investment Opportunities in the Philippines, Board of Investments,\nSeptember 1980.\n# Certifying authority is the Center for Non-conventional Energy Development.\n+\t\n\n7.9\n\nR\n\n,\n\n^^--..-na,.-.n,....s^w\xe2\x80\xa2-...-. \t\n\n..\t\n\n-F -R-...^-.-,^v.a.-_...^\t\n\n..-- ,--^+^.r^,^,A,^,IN^,,,,R \t\n\n-^. _ ,.r :..,^ -F...\n\n^.-_--.-.....^,.^^.....^..A...wn..,,,^\n\nan exceptional business climate for investment by foreign firms in the local\nmanufacture of photovoltaics (See Appendix 8).

An additional incentive to locate a photovoltaic\nmanufacturing facility in the Philippines is its membership in ASEAN - a\npotentially large market that could be developed from the Philippines.\n7.7 Standards and Regulations\nGenerally, all U.S.\n\nstandards are acceptable in the Philippines.

The basis of\ndutiable value is described in the Code as follows:\n"The dutiable value of an imported article subject to\nan ad valorem rate of duty shall be based on the home\nconsumption value or price (excluding internal excise\ntaxes) of same, like or similar articles, as bought\nand sold or offered for sale freely in the usual\nwholesale quantities in the ordinary course of trade,\nin the principal markets of the country from where\nexported on the date of exportation to the Philippines,\nor where there is none on such date, then on the home\nconsumption value or price nearest to the date of\nexportation including the value of all containers,\ncoverings and/or packings of any kind and all other\ncosts, charges and expenses incident to placing the\narticle in the condition ready for shipment to the\nPhilippines plus ten (10) percent of such home\nconsumption value or price."\nIn addition to import duties, energy systems equipment imports are\nsubject to a compensating sales tax as specified in the New Sales Tax\nLaw (NIRC). The rate for energy systems equipment as defined in this study\nwould be 10% calculated on a base of the total landed cost plus a 25%\nmark-up. The calculation would be as follows:\n\na\ni\n7-10\n\n\t\nt\n\n(Home Consumption\n\nvalue)\t\n\n+ ( lot of Nam consumption + ( Postage, Commission\nvalue\t\ni Other Charges)\n\n+ (Custom Duty) w Total Landed Cost\n(Total Landed Cost) + ( 25% of Total Landed cost) x 10%\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsales Tax\n\nIt should be noted that photovoltaic & as a pioneer industry would be\n\'f\t\n\nexempted from all taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code, except\nincome tax, on a diminishing percentage. However, it is not clear whether\nimported\n\nphotovoltaic systems would be exempt from import duties and sales\n\ntaxes. It is likely that imported photovoltaic systems would be taxed if a\nlocal photovoltaic manufacturing capacity existed and therefore imported\nsystems would be at a price disadvantage.\nBalance of system components required for photovoltaic systems would be\ntariffed. Presently, dealers of power generation equipment import\nalternators and motors separately from generators to avoid paying the higher\ntariff for the complete system. In all likelihood, American firms exporting\nphotovoltaic systems to the Philippines will have to ship the balance of\nsystem components separately from photovoltaic malules to avoid paying a\nsimilar import duty on the complete system.\n7.9 Conclusion\nPresently, American manufacturers of photovoltaic systems have several\nadvantages in developing the Philippine market. First, there is an established\ndealer/service/wholesaler network that is extensive and familiar with American\nproducts and business practices. Second, photovoltaic systems have been\n\n\xe2\x80\x94=\t\n\ngranted a number of tax incentives in order to promote the use of these\nsystems in the Philippines. Third, there are a number of entrepreneurs\n\n6ti\t\n`r.^ 1\t\nn\n\n\xc2\xb5\t\ni\n\n711\n\nwilling to invest in local production of photovoltaic systems in ;oint\nventures with American firms. Finally, as a pioneer industry photovoltaic\nsystems will be granted priority access to capital from all governmentowned or controlled financing institutions.\nPotential disadvantages to American development of the Philippine\nmarket is the presence by foreign firms currently being established through\ndemonstration projects.\n\ni\n\n4\n7-12\n\nAPPENDIX A\nPhilippine Key contacts\n\nDr. Jose A.

In particular, it focuses upon the incentives that are\navailable and the regulations that one can expect to encounter in producing\nand/or selling photovoltaics in the Philippines.\nThree cases are developed in the course of this discussion, paralleling the three basic types of business involvement for a foreign (non-Filipino owned) firm in the Philippines. The first case looks at a foreign\nfirm producing photovoltaic products outside the Philippines and exporting\nthem to that country. In the second case, the firm both produces and sells\nphotovoltaic goods inside the Philippines. Finally, in the third case,\nthe firm not only produces and sells photovoltaics within the Philippines,\nbut also exports some of the Philippine-produced goods abroad. Incentives\nand regulations differ for these three scenarios, and these differences are\ndelineated in this examination.\nThis discussion is not intended to serve as a comprehensive manual on\ndoing business in the Philippines. Rather, its purpose is to outline some\nof the major incentives and regulations, acting as a springboard from which\nfurther inquiries for more detailed information can ensue. Accordingly,\nadditional references on specific topics will be furnished throughout the\ndiscussion.\nTable 1 provides background information on the Philippines and its\neconomy. More detailed information can be found in the SGV Group\'s Philippines: An Economic Profile 1979. Having briefly examined the Philippines\nin general, we now turn to the first case -- a foreign firm exporting\nphotovoltaic products to the Philippines.\n\nB-1\n\n1\n;\n\nTABLE 1\nGENERAL PHILIPPINES CHARACTERISTICS\n\nPOPULATION: 42.1 million according to the 1975 Census (Average\nannual growth rate of 2.7 \xe2\x99\xa6 since 1970)\nLANGUAGE: Eighty -seven dialects spoken; chiefly\nIlocano, Taaaloa and Cebuano. Enalish\nis also spoken.\nCURRENCY: Peso (P), U.S. $1 - P7.25 (January 1, 1981)\n\nGNP: P86.7 billion, or approximately U.S. $12 billion,\nin 1979 (in 1972 prices) (An average 6.7% real\nannual growth rate between 1972-1979)\nPRINCIPAL INDUSTRIES: Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries (accounted for\napproximately 608 of labor force in 1977)\nLABOR FORCE: Approximately 16.9 million in 1977 (5s growth rate\nsince 1977)\nTAXES: Corporate Income Tax\nIndividual Income Tax\nExcise Taxes\nLocal Taxes\n(plus others)\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT: Total net inflow of foreign equity investment,\naccording to National Census and Statistics Office,\nof P1,599.2 million (U.S. $216 million) in 1977\n(U.S. a major source of foreign investment).\n\nSources: SGV & Co., Philippines: An Economic Profile 1979\nSGV 6 Co., Doing Business in the Philippines 1980\nPrice Waterhouse, Doing Business in the Philippines, March, 1978.\n\nB-2\n\nt\n9.2 Case 1 -- Export to the Philippines\nIn the first case, a foreign firm is exporting photovoltaic product\nto the Philippines. Here, while the firm may choose to set up an office\n\niL the Philippines to coordinate its activity, there is no actual produc\nof goods within the Philippines.\nA firm exporting to the Philippines is subject to a variety of reg%\nlations. For example, it is prohibited from engaging in retail trade. 7\nRetail Trade Nationalization Act restricts retail trade, either direct c\nindirect, to those firms wholly owned by Philippine citizens. I The fire\npermitted to use foreign trademarks in the Philippines, however, such tj\nmarks or tradenames must be registered with the Philippine Patent Office\n(PPO). This registration is valid for 20 years from the date of issuanc\nso long as the registrant files an affidavit of use with the PPO within one\n(1) year following Cie fifth, tenth and fifteenth anniversaries of the registration. However, in order for registration to be granted, the firm\'s\nhome country must grant similar privileges to Filipinos, i.e., reciprocity.2\nMethods of payment for imports are also regulated. Philippine imports\nmay be financed by either letters of credit (L/Cs), documents against\nacceptance (D/A), or open account (C/A) arrangements. The Philippine\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCentral Bank must approve importations maturing beyond 360 days, as such\nimportations are treated as foreign borrowings. 3 Further detail on payment\nprocedures can be found in Price Waterhouse, Doing Business in the Philipp\'nes (March, 1978). \'\ni\nIn order to comply with Customs and International regulations, a number\nof documents are required for import of goods. These include: \t\n\n1 SGV i Co., Doing Business in the Philippines 1980, p. 29.\n2 Guerrero\n\n(\n\n\t\n\ni\n\n6 Torres, Primer on Doing Business in the Philippines 1980. p. 27.\n\n3Price Waterhouse i Co., Doing Business in the Philippines, March, 1978,\np. 43.\nB-3\na\n\nn\n\n6\nE\n}\nt\nt\n\ne\n\nConsular Invoice for shipments over 9500 in export valuer\n\ne Certificate of Origin;\ne Commercial Invoices\ne Bill of Lading;\ne Inward Cargo Manifest;\ne Delivery Permits\ne Central Bank Release Certificate\xe2\x80\xa2\nIn setting up operations in the Philippines, if desired, the firm may\nestablish and register any of the following:\n1)\n\nJoint Venture Corporation\n\n2)\n\nBranch\n\n3)\n\nSubsidiary\n\n4)\n\nRepresentative Office\n\nThe firm may enter into a joint venture corporation with Philippine residents, contributing equity, subject to Philippine participation regulations.\nAlternatively, a branch is considered an extension of a foreign enterprise,\nand is fully controlled by the parent company. All the assets of the firm\nmay be held liable for the operations of the branch. A subsidiary, while\nnormally mostly owned by the parent company, has a juridicial personality\nseparate and distinct from its parent company, with the parent company .\ninsulated from subsidiary liabilities. Finally, the firm can establish a\nrepresentative office, having a maximum of ten personnel of which only two\ncan be expatriates. 5 Tax information of the various forms of operation can\nbe found in SGV i Co., Doing Business in the Philippines 1980.\n\n4SGV i Co., Doing Business in the Philippines 1980, p. 36.\n5Guerrero & Torres, op. cit., pp. 3-8.\n1\nB-4\n\nA\n\nTable 2 provides a summary of the information in the first case.\n\'\t\n\nTABLE 2\t\nCase 1 -- Export to the Philippines\nGeneral Information\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prohibited from engaging in retail trade.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Permitted to use trademarks and tradenames subject\nto reciprocity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Payment for exports via letters of credit, documents against acceptance, or open account arrangements.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Importations maturing beyond 360 days must be approved by the Central Bank.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A variety of documents required for goods to be\nimported (Consular Invoice on shipments over\n#500, Certificate of Origin, Commercial invoice,\nBill of Lading, Inward Cargo Manifest, Delivery\nPermit, Central Bank Release Certificate).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Four types of Philippines business vehicles can be\nestablished -- joint venture corporation, branch,\nsubsidiary, representative office.\nB.3 Case 2 -- Produce and Sell in the Philippines\nIn the second case, a foreign firm is producing and selling photovoltaic products in the Philippines. All goods that are manufactured are sold\nin the Philippines; none of the firm\'s Philippine production is exported.\nPhotovoltaics is considered a "pioneer" area in the Philippines, and\nas a consequence, firms engaged in producing photovoltaic products qualify\nfor special benefits and incentives once registered with the Philippine\nBoard of Investments (BOI). A foreign firm is permitted to possess 100%\nof capital stock in a Philippine photovoltaics firm, whereas only 30% is\ngenerally allowed for firms engaged in non-priority activities. However,\nit should be noted that "pioneer" enterprises are required to attain Filipino status (60% Filipino ownership) within 30 years unless granted a 10year extension by the DOI.6\n\n6Philippine Board of Investments, Questions and Answers on Foreign Investments in the Philippines, June, 1980, pp. 4-5.\na-s\n\nP\n\n\t\nr\n1\n\nPhotovoltaic enterprises also qualify for a variety of benefits under\nthe Investment Incentives Act (R.A. 5186) as amended by Presidential Decree\nNo. 1584. Table 3 summarises the incentives provided to firms; specific\nprovisions of the Act can be found in the B0I\'s, The Investment and Export\nIncentives Act. Further, a firm is able to qualify for additional incentives if it locates its production, processing and manufacturing plants in an\narea designated as less developed. The additional incentives include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tax allowance to the extent of actual investment but not to\nexceed 301 of taxable income;\nExemption from General Banking Act collateral requirement on\nloans against real estate security;\ne Exemption from the payment of filing, processing and all other\nfees of BOI and Security and Exchange Commission if total assets\nare less than 1 million pesos.?\nAs p%rt of its effort to respond to its need for greater self-sufficiency in energy resources, the Philippines extends additional benefits to\nthose cited above to photovoltaic enterprises as part of its 1980 Energy\nPriorities Program. Projects registered under the program are accorded\npriority by all government-owned or controlled financing institutions,\nsuch as the Central Bank and the Development Bank, and are given preferential consideration on collateral, rediscounting and other requirements in\norder to facilitate the early establishment of the projects.8\nFinally, photovoltaic enterprises, as are all foreign investors and\nenterprises, are given several basic rights and guarantees to ensure the\nsafety of foreign investments. These include:\n\n- Y\n\n\t\n?Philippine Board of Investments, Investment Opportunities in the Philipines, pp. 25-26.\n\n\t\na\n\nBPhilippine Board of Investments, 1980 Thirteenth Investment Priorities\nPlan, Sixth Public Utilities Plan and Energy Priorities Program, pp. 13-14.\nr\nB-6\n\n.r-\n\ns\n\nTABLE 3\n\n!\t\n\nCase Z -- Produce and Sell in the Philippines\nSummary of Incentive\ns Under Investment Incentives Act\n\nR:\t\n^.\'\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deduction of organizational and preoperational expenses from\ntaxable income.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deduction of labor training expenses.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Accelerated depreciation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Carry-over as deduction of net operating losses incurred in\nany of first 10 years of operation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Exemption/reduction and/or deferment of tariff duties and compensating tax on importations of machinery, equipment and spare\nparts.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tax credit equivalent to 100% of the value of compensating tax\nand customs duties that would have been paid on machinery, etc.\nhad it been imported.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Tax credit for tax withheld on interest payments on foreign\nloans.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Right to employ foreign nationals in supervisory, technical or\nadvisory positions within 5 years from registration.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Deduction from taxable income of a percentage of undistributed\nprofits.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-dumping protection (i.e., limit imports that compete unfairly\nor unnecessarily).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Protection from Government competition.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Exemption from all taxes under the National Internal Revenue\nCode, except income tax on a gradually diminishing percentage.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Post-operative tariff protection.\n\n-^\t\n\nSource: Philippine Board of Investments, _Investment Opportunities in the\nPhilippines.\n\n8-7\n\n\t\n\nf\t\n\nt\t\n\ns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Basic rights and guarantees under the Constitutions\ne Right to repatriate investments and remit earnings\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Right to remit foreign exchange to service foreign loans and\nobligations arising from technological assistance contractst\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Freedom from expropriation of property except for public use,\nnational welfare and defense upon payment of just compensations\ne Freedom from requisition of investment, except in event of war\nor national emergency and only for the duration thereof and\nwith just compensation.\nP.4 Case 3 -- Produce in Philippines and Sell in Philippines and/or Abroad\nIn the third cases a foreign firm is producing photovoltaic products\nin the Philippines. It may either sell part of its goods in the Philippines and part abroad, or export all of its Philippine pr(,\xe2\x80\xa2du:tion.\nIn an effort to develop the country\'s export trade, the Philippines\noffer benefits and incentives in addition to those delineated in Scenario\n2, to photovoltaic enterprises that produce for export. Photovoltaic\nenterprises that export at least 70 \xe2\x99\xa6 of their total production are allowed\nan additional 10 years to attain Filipino status, 40 years as opposed to\n30 years.

Moreover, if a firm exports 1001 of its production, it need\nnot attain Filipino status.9\nPhotovoltaic firms registered with the BOI as a "registered export\nproducer," also qualify for additional benefits under the Investment Incentives Act and the Export Incentives Act (R.A. 6135) as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1646.

Table 5 summarizes benefits for the three cases we have examined. incentives are\nprovided in many forms, primarily by lowering tax expenses and generating\nan environment conducive to firm operation.\nPhotovoltaics, by virtue of its "pioneer" status, qualifies for most of\nthe incentives offered, as long as goods are produced in the Philippines.\nIn addition, supplemental benefits can be received if the firm exports a\nportion of its Philippine photovoltaics production and if the firm locates\n!\t\n\nits plants in an area designated as less developed. In either case, though,\nfirms are subject to the regulations on registration, Filipino status and\nother matters.that govern doing business in the Philippines.\n\ni\n3\n5-9\n\n\t\n\nTABLE 5\nIncentives to P/V Firms Doing Business in the Philippines\n\nFirm that l\t\nExports to\t\nPhilippines\t\n\nIncentive\n\nFirm that\nFirm that\t\nManufactures in\nPhilippines and\nManufactures\t\nand Sells in Exports some of\nPhilippines\t\nProduct Abroad\n\nDeduction of organizational and preoperational expenses\n\nX\n\nDeduction of labor training expenses\n\nX\n\nAccelerated depreciation\n\nX\n\nCarryover as deduction of net operating losses\n\nX\n\nExemption/reduction of tariff duties\non imports\n\nX\n\nTax credit on value of customs duties\n\nX\n\nTax credit for tax withheld on interest\npayments on foreign loans\n\nX\n\nRight to employ foreign nationals in\nsupervisory, technical or advisory\npositions within 5 years from\nregistration\n\nX\n\nDeduction of a percentage of\ntributed profits\n\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\n\t\n\nundis-\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\nX\n\t\n\nX\n\nAnti-dumping protection\n\nX\n\nProtection from Government competition\n\nX\n\nExemption from all taxes under\nNational Internal Revenue Code,\nexcept income tax\n\nX\n\nPost-operative tariff protection\n\nX\n\n\t\n\nX\n\n\t\n\t\n\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nDeduction of direct labor cost and\nlocal raw materials used in manufacture of exports\n\n"W\t\n\nTax credits on taxes and duties on\nsupplies used in production of\nexported goods\n\nX\n(cont\'d.)\n\nw;\nB-10\n\nF\'\nTABLE 5\n(co4t\'d.)\n\nIncentive\n\nFirm that \t\nExports to\t\nPhilippines\t\n\nfirm that\t\nManufactures\t\nand Sells in\t\nPhilippines\t\n\nFirm that\nManufactures in\nPhilippines and\nExports some of\nProduct A9road\n\nExemption from sales tax on export\nproducts sold to other export proX\n\nducers or export traders\n\nEmployment of foreign nationals within\nS years from operation\n\nX\n\nExemption from export and stabilization tax\n\nX\n\nAdditional incentives depending on\nlocation of plants\n\n1 Note:\n\n\t\nX\n\nAssumed here that firm does not operate Philippine office.\n\ni\n8-li\n\nf ^_\n\nX\n\n\t\n\n_\t\n\n`\xc2\xb0 \'." +^ .: \xc2\xb0"`\'\xc2\xb0\'^\'\'^"",\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0""01,"7"+el^\'T+ ten,. \'\'*\'ir\'7a1^!1\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\'.^.

They accept savings and checking or current accounts and other\nusual bank services like loans and trust holdings, extend domestic and\nexport letters of credit and trust receipt services. They are also\nactive in the money market and in small loans to small and medium-scale\nindustries. In the Philippines, some banks are even involved in credit\ncard operations and financing through a system of sister companies.\nCredits granted by commercial banks consist loans, advances,\ndiscounts, overdrafts, domestic bills, customer\'s liability acceptances\nand export bills.\nOf the P52,510 . 7 million total credits granted by commercial banks\nin 1977, 72.29 percent or roughly 138.0 billion went to private businesses\nand individuals. Credits granted to local governments as well as semigovernment entities reached P6,04P.8 million or 11.52 percent while\nanother 6 . 23 percent or P3,270.0 million was availed of by the national\ngovernment.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Savings and Mortgage Banks\nA savings and mortgage bank is any corporation organized primarily\nfor accumulating the small deposits of the public and reinvesting them in\nbonds, in loans secured by pledge or chattel mortgage certificates, buying\nand selling them or receiving them in payment of loans. However, a savings\nbank cannot engage in foreign exchange trading, nor can it open letters of\ncredit. It can grant all kinds of loans extendable by commercial banks,\nexcept character loans or overdraft lines which are payable on a medium or\nlong - term basis.\nTotal resources of savings banks amounted to P2 , 810.4 million as of\nthe end of 1977. Total loans outstanding of savings and mortgage banks on\nthe other hand, amounted to P1 , 954.9 million broken down as follows:\nagricultural - P200 million; commercial - P2 million; industrial - P22\nmillion; real estate - P1,112 million; consumption - P195 million; and\nsundry - P424 million. Investments in bonds and other securities meanwhile reached P415 . 3 million. Total loans and investments made by the\nsavings banks reached P2,370.2 million in 1977.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rural Banks\n\n\t\n\nRural banks are generally small regional unit banks. In terms of\nassets and size, they are smaller than either the savings or comiercial\nbanks. They perform the same savings and loan services as thrift banks\nbut rural banks specialize in extending small loans to farmers. Some, are\n\ns\nr\n\nk\nG\n\nr-1\n\nalso authorized to accept demand deposits or checking accounts.\nAll rural banks are privately owned, but they receive financial and\ntechnical assistance and incentives from the government. Their\nmain sources of funds therefore are the deposits of rural savers\nand the financial assistance of the government.\nAbout !977.5 million or 47.3 percent of the total loans granted\nwas made under the supervised credit scheme. The balance of\nP1,088.2 million or 52.7 percent was extended under the non-supervised credit program.\nAgricultural loans accounted for 87.1 percent of the total\nloans granted for the year. Commercial loans represented 8.7 percent, while industrial and other loans constituted 2.7 and 1.5\npercent, respectively. Investment in securities on the other hand,\nreached !832.1 million.\nThe rural banking system aims to accomplish the followin g goals\nand objectives: 1) to continue to support the food production program and other developmental projects of the government through\nactive participation in the various special financing programs;\n2) to exert more efforts in mobilizing savings and promoting capital\nformation to be able to provide more and better service to small\nfarmers and producers in the rural areas; 3) to step up participation\nin the fourth Central Bank-International Bank for Reconstruction and\nDevelopment (CB-IBRD) rural credit project to meet the increasing\ndemands of agriculture and industries for medium and long-term\ncredit; 4) to cooperate with the government in devising ways and\nmeans to reduce the percentage of arrearages of the system to a more\nmanageable level; and 5) to pursue a program of developing managerial\nskills and personnel capabilities through sustained training programs\nand seminars, so that rural banks will be in a better position to\ncope with their day-to-day operational problems.\ne Land Bank of the Philippines\nThe Land Bank is charged with Vie responsibility of giving\nfinancial support to three of the more important aspects of the\nagrarian reform program namely: 1) the transfer of ownership of\nagricultural lands covered by the agrarian reform from landlord to\ntenant-farmers; 2) the effort to help farmer-beneficiaries of land\nreform increase their productivity and income; and 3) the redirection\nof land-owner resources to industry or other productive endeavors.\nMoreover, the bank in its capacity as administrator of two agricultural guarantee funds (the Land Bank Agricultural Guarantee Fund\n(LB-AGF) and the Agricultural Guarantee Fund (AGF-R.A. 6390)), extends\ncoverage on certain types of loans granted to farmers by selected\nlending institutions. Through its guarantee operations, the bank\nmakes it possible for farmers with meager resources to undertake productive activities by encouraging lending institutions to extend\ncredit without being too strict about collateral requirements.\n\nD-2\n\na Development Banks\nExcept for the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), development banks are usually small in size and operate as regional banks.\nWhile they rely heavily on local or foreign borrowings through a program\nof bond issues, they are also authorized to generate deposit funds from\nthe public as their source of funds for the loans and financing services\nthey provide.\nDevelopment banks usually provide short-to-long term financing for\nproductive enterprises on a secured basis. Compared with commercial\nbanks which can loan or finance an enterprise without collateral or\nsecurity for the amount borrowed, development banks and thrift banks are\nsecurity or collateral oriented.\nForemost among the development banks is the Development Bank of the\nPhilippines. It is entrusted with the responsibilities of providing\ncredit facilities for the rehabilitation, development and expansion of\nagriculture and industry, the reconstruction of the national economy,\nand the promotion and establishment of private development banks in provinces and cities.\nAs of year-end 1977, total resources of the DBP rose to new levels P15.7 billion as against 112.7 billion in 1976.\nInvestments in securities also increased by P573 million from 92.1\nbillion to 92.6 billion. Of these outstanding investments, 92.12 billion\nor 81 percent are investments in government securities and P503 million or\n19 percent are private securities. Loan portfolio as of December 31, 1977,\nlikewise increased by 91.8 billion or 23 percent from !7,870.2 million to\nP9,665.9 million.\nThe thrust of lending operations of the bank during the period under\nreview continued to be on countryside development as well as on small and\nmedium-scale industry financing. Under the DBP\'s countryside development\nprogram, equal attention is given to agricultural and industrial projects.\nIn agriculture, priority is given to projects geared towards self-sufficiency\nin food, production of raw materials for local industry needs and diversification of agricultural exports.\n0 Non-Bank Financial Institutions\nThe non-bank sector, while extending financial services to the commercial and industrial sectors of the economy, has a different source of funds.\nNon-banks cannot generate deposit funds from the public, thus they generally\nresort to stockholder\'s funds and deposit substitute liabilities to fund\nlending activities. Deposit substitutes are financial instruments held by\nthe non-banking sector as part of its funds. These include commercial\npapers such as stocks and bonds, short and long-term debt instruments, and\nother credit instruments obtained from money market activities. The nonbank sector also borrows funds to finance its services.\n\na\nf\nD-3\n\n(\nr\n\nNon-bank financial institutions include: the National Investment\nand Development Corporation (NIDC), Private Development Corporation of\nthe Philippines (PDCP), BANCOM Development Corporation, Non-Stock\nSavings and Loan Associations, the Government Service Insurance System\n(GSIS), Social Security System (SSS), Agricultural Credit Administration\n(ACA), and Mutual Building and Loan Association (MBLA).\nThe NIDC, PDCP, and BANCOM Development Corporation provide primarily\nlong-term financing for expansion and modernization of productive\nventures and for facilitating short-term placements to commercial\nbanks. Stock Savings and Loan Association contributes to home savings\nand to the growing need for more savings institutions.\n- Government Non-Bank Financial Institutions\nLoanable funds of government non-bank financial institutions\n(comprising the GSIS, SSS, ACA and NIDC) released their funds in\n1977 for the following purposes: agricultural - P40 million; industrial - P40 million; consumption - P893 million; real estate P579 million; public utility - P21 million and other purposes (consisting mostly of notes receivable from financial firms) - P2,359.4\nmillion. Combined, these loans aggregated P3,932.8 million reflecting\nan expansion of 49 percent over the level of the preceding year.\nAccounting for the increase was the !1,619.2 million growth in\nother purpose loans which more than offset the decreases in loans\nfor industrial, consumption, real estate and public utility purposes.\n- Agricultural Credit Administration\nCreated under R.A. 3844, also known as the Agricultural Land\nReform Code, the Agricultural Credit Administration (ACA) was\nspecifically designed to help farmers elevate their living standards\nto make them active factors in the country\'s economic development.\nIts activities are therefore, geared at raising the economic wellbeing of the rural populace by increasing their agricultural production. To achieve this end, it provides the farmers with the necessary\ntechnical guidance and credit assistance for the cost of production\ninputs.\nThe ACA grants six types of loans, namely: production, facility,\ncommodity, marketing, operating capital and poultry loans. A major\nportion of the loans granted from 1960 to 1977 were of the production,\ncommodity and marketing types. These three types of loans, constituted\nan average of 66.7, 6.0 and 21.7 percent respectively, of the total\nloans granted in 1977 of #49.7 million.\n- Private Non-Bank Financial Institutions\n\nc\n\n1\n\nPrivate non-bank financial enterprises showed reduced lending\noperations in 1977 as loans granted totaling !1,410 million declined\nby 28 percent from the previous year\'s figure of #1,969 million.\nThese loans were released by BANCOM, PDCP, MBLA and Non-Stock SLA\nfor various purposes, namely: agricultural - P28 million; commercial - P46.2 million; real estate - P172.3 million; public utility P9.7 million; and others - P707.2 million. Except agricultural\nD-4\n\npurpose loans which expanded by more than two times, other types of\nloans registered decrements ranging from 3 percent to 83 percent\nas against their respective levels in 1976.\n- Investment Houses\nInvestment houses grant medium to long-term loans for capital\nexpansion purposes. The basic function of investment houses,\nhowever, is the underwriting and distribution of securities of\nother corporations. Commissions and serv<.ces from this function\nand earnings from money market activities are their main sources\nof funds.\nFinance companies on the other hand, are authorized to finance\nconsumer durables under installment payment plans. They usually\nextend short-to-medium term credit to manufacturers and merchants\nfor inventory, receivable financing and transport equipment leasing.\nFinancing companies usually rely on stockholders funds and cash\ngenerated from their money market activities to finance their\noperation.\nThe Private Development Corporation of the Philippines is a\ndevelopment finance institution which is committed to encourage\nthe emergence and growth of Philippine productive enterprises by\nproviding technical and financial assistance through the purchase\nof equity investments and expertise.\nThe BANCOM Development Corporation extends assistance to\nprojects which are viewed to be primary contributors to the acceleration of the country\'s economic development. Most of these\nprojects are registered with the Board of Investments and are\ninvolved in the production of essential products like petroleum,\nmining, wood, pharmaceutical, paper, sugar and coconut. Like\nthe PDCP, it also engages in money market operations and it has\nactively engaged in the organization of the Money Market Association of the Philippines.\n\nD-S\n\nAPPENDIX E\nASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nThis appendix lists the methodology, data and assumptions used in\nthe financial and economic analyses described in Chapter S. They reflect\nactual conditions existing in the Philippines in October/November, 1960.\nFuel cost escalations of 319 and 241 for gasoline and diesel, respectively,\nare the average values experienced between 1975 and 1980. A 39 escalation\nrate reflects the generally accepted value of worldwide fuel cost escalations.\n\n1\n\nA discount rate of 211 for the financial analyses if; equal to\n\nthe commercial bank loan rate and reflects the project evaluation criteria\nused by the Development Bank of the Philippines project staff. Sources of\nother data and assumptions are clearly stated at the bottom of each table.\nMethod of Calculating Present Value of Life Cycle Costs (PVLCC)\nAssume an initial cash flow at time zero followed by cash flows at\nthe end of each year, n, where n=1,2,3 -- N; N being the life in years of\nthe system. The various present values, P, to be calculated are defined\nbelow.\n\nE\n\n1) Fuel -- The cost of fuel during the first year is C , its cost escalation rate is E, and the discount rate (or expected after-tax rate of\nreturn on investment) is R.

The cost escalation rate for transportation is T. The present value of fuel transportation is:\n\nR = 0 T L Q\xe2\x80\xa2 PW F (RT, N)\t\nT\n\n(6)\n\nWhere:\n\nRT+ ^ tT\t\n_I\n4)\n\n(7)\n\nInitial Cash Disbursement -- This is the total initial investment.

The country is normally\nvisited by about 20 tropical cyclones (storms and typhoons) annually\ncausing damage to crops and livestock. Your types of climate are characterised by either the length of absence of a dry season, or by the timing\nof maximum rainfall.. The western part has a dry season lasting from December to May. The eastern part has no dry season but a very pronounced\nrainfall from December to February. The central part of the country has\ntwo climates: in the north a short dry season which lasts from 1-3 months;\nin the south rainfall is fairly well distributed throughout the year but\nthe total amount is less than that in the eastern part of the country. The\nmean annual rainfall for the entire country is 2,530mm.\nAgriculture, fishery and forestry contributed, in 1979, 26% of the\ngross national product. Almost half of the Philippine\'s population is\nagricultural (21,529,000). Sixty-five to seventy percent of this population\nare rice and/or maize semi-sufficient farmers. Eight million hectares are\nclassified as arable and permanent cropland, providing less than .4 ha. per\nagricultural caput. Average farm size has been estimated at close to 3h\nhectares. Land is perhaps the biggest constraint in Philippine agriculture;\nnext comes water; then comes labor.\nCentral Luzon is the nation\'s rice bowl, with the bulk of irrigated\nland occurring in this section. The northern regions (Ilocos, Cagayan\nValley and Central Luzon) and the western Visayas are the most important\nareas of intensive crop farming. Large tracts of arable land are left\nfallow in the eastern Visayas and Mindanao. Large-scale operators everywhere are involved in sugar, bananas and pineapple for export, and are\nincreasingly taking over poultry and swine production. Smallholders\nprimarily produce food grains for domestic use and coconut for export.\nLivestock: Most of the cattle are raised by small-scale farmers,\n\neach with one to several head. Meat consumption is low and native cattle\nare raised primarily as work animals, second in importance only to the\ncarabao. This water buffalo plows the rice paddies and other lard, is a\nmain source of transportation, and an emergency source of cash. Carsbaos\nalso account for 2/3 the beef supply. Most animals are maintained by\ngrazing on fallow fields and harvest stubble with a supplementary feeding\n\nF-2\n\n\t\n\n+etr .,..,...,.^._...__ \t\n\n____._\xe2\x80\xa2_^.\n\nof rice straw. \t\n\nI\n\nThe Philippine dairy farming industry is wry limited. Presently\n\n{\t\n\nthere are only a few commercial dairy operations.\nPoultry production ( eggs and meat) has become highly c =arcialized\n(65% of the chicken population) in locations near metropolitan areas,\nand continues to expand. The Philippines is now self-sufficient in\npoultry, and increased development is being hindered by the high cost of\nprotein feed ingredients which are mostly imported.\nCommerical piggeries currently account for 10% of the country\'s pork\nproduction, the balance being in small backyard operations. A few Corporations operate large holdings\n\n( 10,000-15,OOOha.)\n\nand corporations have\n\nset up a few feed-lot fattening businesses to utilize waste from primary\nenterprises. Total number of cattle at a given time is about 6,000 head.\nForestry:\n\nForest products rank among the country \' s top four categor-\n\nies in export value. Mahoganies make up the bulk of lumber exports.\nFishing: Although the Philippines lies in a fertile fishing belt,\n\nthe domestic fishing has remained underdeveloped. Obsolete techniques,\ninadequate refrigeration and marketing facilities, and lack of investment\ncapital have handicapped the industry so that production does not meet\neven domestic needs. The annual fish catch in 1977 totaled 1,510,789 MT\nwhich was wostly anchovies, mackerels, sea bass, sardines, tuna, bonito\nand shark.\nSmall-scale, traditional fishermen in the Philippines use gear not\nrequiring boats, or boats of three tons or less. More than one-third of\nthe fishermen are dependent upon mototized bancas (consuming an average of\n1200\n\nliters of gasoline each every year), but almost all fishing gear is\n\ntotally non-mechanical. (The primary exception to this are the artificial\nlights used in basnig-fishery where fish are guided into surrounding nets\n\t\n\nby the light. Ninety percent of the sardines are caught in this method.)\n\nr\n\nTraditional fishermen fish both inland and ocean waters. There are\napproximately 600,000 traditional fishermen located in some 10 , 000 coastal\nfishing villages throughout the country. They use innumerable techniques\nsuch as brush traps, tubular split bamboo traps, bamboo wiers of elaborate\n\n\t\n\ni\nt\n\nF-3\n\ndesign and size, "Kalaskas" boats which have bamboo and rattan root scaressweepers, dkimming nets, "Sapyan" shoal nets, purse seines, and tiny cover\npots for use in the paddy fields.\nFishing villages are generally without wharves, cold storage facilities, ice plants, or fish markets. In fact, fishermen are dependent neon\nthose who market their catch. The relationship between fisherman and\nbuyer is called "saki." While suki has nutually beneficial aspects,\nfishermen often end up indepted to buyers and boat owners.\nBy presidential decree in 1972, the country undertook the land reform\ntask of transferring ownership of farmland to about half the country\'s\nmillion landless tenants. By September 1979, the Ministry of Agrarian\nReform reported having issued 427,149 Certificates of Land Transfer (CLT)\nto 308,068 tenants cultivating 525,590 hectares.\n(2) Agricultural Development Plans\nThe long tezm development goal is that of achieving self-sufficiency\nin agricultural production. High priority, therefore, is centered upon\nfood production and distribution, fisheries, livestock, and related\nagricultural activities. The main thrust is the production of cheap but\n\nhighly nutritious\n\nfoods that can also generate export earnings. The\n\ngovernment has launched the Bakahang Barangay (backyard cattle raising)\nproject and has implemented a Dairy Industry Development Act to attain\nself-sufficiency in beef by 1985 and cut dairy imports. The Ministry is\nalso making efforts to establish crops traditionally imported, such as\nsoybeans, wheat, and cotton.\nThe Philippines has reached self-sufficiency in rice, and government\nefforts are now on increased production of yellow maize, and sorghum.\nThe Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) has started a program for replanting\nold areas and planting improved hybrid vazieties. A plant for production\nof soybean products is being constructed which will require 500 tons of\nsoybeans during the first three years of operation, 50% of which is to be\nlocally grown soybeans. Banana hectarage are planned for a 25% increase,\nland allocated to producers according to past performance.\n\nw\n\nF-4\n\nI\ni\n4\n\n(3)\n\nincome Distribution\n\na Seventy-four percent of farm families in 1971 did not receive enough\ninoome to meet the food poverty\n\nthreshold, as\n\ncalculated by the Bureau of\n\nCensus and Statistics using A.S. Abrera\'s "Philippine Poverty Thresholds"\ndocument. Poverty distribution was relatively even across all eleven\nislands, only falling down to 60% for farm families in Central Luzon. The\nbulk of those farmers with the lowest incomes were the 40% of the nation\'s\ncultivators who have less than two hectares of land.\n\n(4) Credit, Cooperatives, and Extension Services\nCredit: Most farm investment is financed by non-institutional means\nby the farmer---through relatives, landlords, or private moneylenders.\nProduction credit is granted by rural banks and the Philippine National\nBank (the latter is the main source of credit for sugar planters). An\nagency for small farmer credit, the Agricultural Credit Administration,\naccounted for only 1% of total production credit in 1971. Marketing credit\nis provided by the government-owned Philippine National Bank and by private\ncommercial banks.\nInstitutional credit has been primarily reserved for larger commercial\noperations.\nParticipation in cooperatives has been relatively minor, with most\nactivity taking place in communal irrigation works, purchasing cooperatives,\nor loosely structured organizations owning warehouses and milling equipment.\nThe problem of agricultural marketing in the Philippines is one of distributing products in such a way the farmer gets rewarded for his labor. This\napplies equally to export products. For this purpost. the organization of\nfarmers into marketing cooperatives is being encouraged and even given\ndirect assistance from the government. Farmers are asked to join precooperative groups for training in cooperative principals and practices,\nthen these groups are expected to amalgamate into area marketing co-ops.\nThe main unit of agricultural extension is the Agricultural Productivity Commission (APC) which was integrated as the Bureau of Agriculture\nExtension (BAEX) into the Department of Agriculture and Natural Aetzurces\na\nF-5\t\n\n\'\n\nI\n\nin the early 1 70\'s. Also, the Department of Agrarian Affairs (DAR) still\nmaintains an extension service in the land reform area which now encompasses such of the country. As of 1973, there was only one extension agent\nfor 1,400 farmers.\n\n(5) Storage Methods\nThe Palay (unmilled rice) crop is almost entirely solar dried. This\ntakes place both on the farm and after threshing at the mill. Some mechanical driers exist but poor siting and operating costs leave them underutilized. Losses are high from solar drying because the unequal temperature and humidity causes grain cracking, over-drying, and leaves palay\nsubject to rodents, birds and insects.\nPalay and rice are stored in sacks, with only a few bulk storage\nbins and silos available. Sack storage actually minimizes losses from\nsweating and mold damage, for bulk storage requires a strict control of\nmoisture.\nMaize is stored on the farm as whole ears, shelling it only as it is\nrequired. Little, if any, drying of shelled maize is practiced on farms.\nFew mechanical driers exist, and most mills have concrete floors upon which\ngrain is spread for solar drying.\nMost farmers do not have storage facilities for coconut. Nuts are\nsold to desiccated coconut factories. They have to be hauled to a usually\ndistant road where they are collected by the buyer. Cost of transport is\nhigh and poor road facilities lead to multiple handling of the copra by\na large number of middlemen.\nBecause of the size and dispersion of individual wholesale markets,\nviajeros (truck-buyers) buy most vegetable produce either directly from\n\nthe farmer or from a local assembler. Loosely woven bamboo baskets (an\nimportant cottage industry) are customary containers in all sizes for\nall produce.\nAn increasing share of the marketing of foocgrains, feedgrains, and\npulses has been assumed by the government under the National Grains\nAuthority. Storage facilities are owned primarily by millers as independ-\n\nF-6\n\nent warehousing activities have beco.s financially less attractive due to\nincreasing government control of marketing margins.\n\n(6) Agricultural Production\nModern crop production is generally restricted to sugarcane, pineapple and some rice. These two crops use most of the country\'s fertiliser\nand cultivation/harvesting large and small machinery.\nMost farming is done with human and animal labor. Some farmers may\nintensively plant, using hybrid seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, but\nthese practices are most likely conducted by hand. The greatest percentage\nof farming is semi-self-sufficient farming of mixed crops for domestic\nconsumption, and coconuts (often in affixed cultivation) as a case. crop. If\ncrop rotation is practiced, it is that of fallow fields, or a dry crop is\nplanted on the same piece of land following a wet season crop. A lowland\nrice crop, for instance, may be harvested from November to February, depending upon the variety, and after rice harvest the field may be planted to\ncorn, tobacco, vegetables... or all three.\n\nSugar cane\n\n7\xe2\x80\xa2 of the arable lands a production of 2.4 million MT\nin the 1 78- 1 79 season; 2nd in export value with $168.7\nmullion\n\nSugar cane is the largest user of pesticides, herbicides, and farm\nmachinery in the Philippines. (Quantitative date, however, is lacking.)\n\nI\n\nMechanization, however, is only on the large farms. Over 90\xe2\x80\xa2 of farms\ngrowing sugar cane are under 50 hectares and have little or no mechanical\nequipment. The sugar industry uses all kinds of fuel including firewood.\nIn fact, the largest commercial consumption of firewood is the sugar\nindustry.\nMost sugar farms are in Central Luzon and the western Visayas. Hand\nlabor is still used even on the mechanized farms. Indeed, tise Pakiao\nlabor system is used on nearly 80% of the sugar cane haciendas. This\nsystem consists of setting a flat rate per hectare for a given operation\n(e.g., planting, weeding, or ratooning).\nt\nk\t\nF-7\t\n\nq\n\ni\n\nMilling is dons commercially with so strict scheduling of delivery so\nthat there is a 100 loss of sugar produce between harvesting and milling\nbecause can quality declines rapidly after 49 hours of harvest. Scheduling would necessitate timely land preparation, but farmers with loss than\n\'\n\n50 hectares can ill afford the purchase of a tractor.\t\n\nMT\nCentral Luzon has the greatest wmnt, and best, land for paddy rice\n(good paddy land is now priced at 2,000-5,000 per hectare). Under irrigation with M seed, and with mechanical equipment or extremely high labor\ninput, double and even triple crops can be grown. Production of this type\nis capital intensive until harvest (land preparation, irrigation, seed,\nlabor and fertilizer), then labor intensive. !land tractors save time in\ntillage and speed up cultivation for high yielding varieties, making an\nextra crop possible, but costs are high and despite low wage labor costs\nthe financial results are frequently r or unless subsidies are provided.\nThe use of small power-pumps for utilizing both surface and underground\nwater is increasing.\nThe palsy is almost entirely solar dried before milling. Ten percent\nof the crop is not milled allowing for seed and wastage (including that\nfed to livestock). Milling is generally done off the farm by\n\nMills using\n\neither the Kiskisan or Cono milling machines.\n\nCoconut\n\n42arable land devoted to this crops\n11,661,000 MT production coconut,\n2,600,000 MT production of copra.\n\nAlthough coconut is the number one export crop of the Philippines,\nwith coconut products for export totaling 2740 million in 1979, its\ncultivation continues to be that of a traditional crop. Trees are handplanted, grazing stock generally keeps weeds under control, draft animals\nare occasionally used though mostly for transport, and nuts are processed\ninto copra on the farm.\n\nF-8\n\nLarge coconut fazmers utilise tomato. Tenants provide hand labor\nand guarding, being paid in cash if they do not participate in copra\nproduction or by share of produce and annual crops cultivated under trees\nif they do. Smallholders, however, make up the bulk (70% under 4 ha.) of\ncoconut growers.\nFor making copra, the nuts are husked, cut into halves and dried.\nAfter the first drying, the nut neat is scooped out of the shell and dried\nfor a second time. This is done in the sun (104) or in "taF,ahans".\n(Tapahans are grills over an open fire with coconut shells and husks used\nas fuel.)\nGood quality copra should be :.tied for at least three days to a\nmoisture content of not more than 6%. Often this drying process time is\nspeeded up, drying the copra unequally, scorching it, and the resulting\ncopra is dark in color and susceptible to insect attack and mould. Copra\nkilns are used very infrequently in the Philippines. Inexpensive copvdrying installations used in other countries have not yet been adapted.\n\nmaize\n404 of arable and permanent land devoted\nto this crops 3,167,000 MT production\n\nMaize is grown mostly in the traditional method, even when planted\nas a sole crop. About 654 of the maize is for human consumption usually\nin the form of grits; 154 is fed to animals and poultry on the farms;\nthe remainder is manufactured into animal feed or starch and glucose off\nthe farm. production is centered in Mindanao and Visayss, with the white\nmaize variety comprising 904 of the crop grown. It is grown at all times\nof the year with double cropping being the most ccm nion.\nMilling methods are similar to those for palsy,\n\nmost\n\nmilling done\n\ncommercially. Absence of adequate feeder roads and high transport costs\nfrequently equal 504 of the farmer\'s realised value.\nVery few mechanical shellers exist, and these are owned by millers\nor "first buyers" (miller\'s agents).\n\nF-9\n\nu\n\nPine\n_ apple\n550,000 MT production, 156,600,000 export value\n(canned)\nBanana\n2,500,000 MT production; $70,700,000 export value\n\',bbacco\n82 3 4 MT production; $26,300,000 export value\n,\t\n, 4\n\nThough pineapple, banana, coffee, and tobacco are considerable export\ncrops for the Philippines, they are generally produced by hand and \'Animal\nlabor except for land preparation (and sometimes spraying and fertilizing)\nby those farmers owning tractors.\nPineapple production is expected to increase as a third commercial\ncanning plant begins operation. Bananas are now the third major agricultural export, behind coconut products and sugar.\nTraditional crop production may be better characterized by breaking\nfarmers into five major groups:\n-the indigenous kainginero (shifting cultivator\nupland farmer\n\n-the marginal kainginero\t\n-upland rice/maize farmer\n-paddy rice farmer\n-rainforest shifting cultivator\t\n\nlowland farmer\n\nThe indigenous kainginero is an upland farmer usually exercisinq\nsquatter\'s rights and oftentimes migrating as soil depletion or ego,-lor.\nlovers yields. The farmer cleans, by slash and burn, a hectare at a tame\nand subsists on a variety of annual crops. Most of his income is derived\nfrom the sale cf root crops like cassava, and what upland race isn\'t consumed domestically. He may, as well, raise a few pigs or chickens.\nThe marginal kainginero farms from one to two hectares a:. a time.\nThis farmer clears land by slash and burn to plant annuals and perennials,\noften including coffee a;id fruit trees.\nThe upland maize/rice farmer relies upon plowed land to plant maize\nin the dry season and rice in the wet season. He also cultivates in mixed\n\nF-10\n\n\t\n\ncropping coconuts, bananas, fruit trees and vegetables. Small livestock\n\ni\t\n\noften are included in the farm husbandry. This farmer has more tools and\n\n1\n\nmay even possess a hand tractor or hand thresher.\nt\t\n\nMany gland farmers engage in off-farm work like rattan gathering,\nabaca stripping and copra-raking on lowland farms.\n\ni\nPaddy rice farmers of the, lowland areas grow at least one crop of\nrice a year. Few farmers grow only rice and raise other crops in rotation\nor along with rice. One in three farmers on irrigated paddy cultivates\ntwo rice crops. Farmers on irrigated land generally eat 20\xe2\x80\xa2 of their rice\ncrop, and use 40% to pay for hired labor. Many paddy farmers never receive\nthe full support price of rice because of their inability to adequately\ndry or clean it. (Twenty percent of palay is hand-milled on the farm by\npounding with mortar and pestle.) Most farm units include small livestock\nand permanent fruit trees.\t\n\ns\n\nAn example of the shifting cultivator in the rainforest is the Hanunoo\nof Mindoro. The Hanunoo\'s cultivation includes the astonishing number of\n430 species of intercropped plants. H.C. Conklin, in an FAO report, wrote\nof their farming thusly:\n"At the sides and against the swidden fences there is found\nan association dominated by low-climbing or sprawling legumes\n(asparagus beans, sieva beans, hyacinth beans, string beans,\nand cowpeas). As one goes out into the center of the swidden,\none passes through an association dominated by ripening grain\ncrops, but also including numerous maturing root crops, shrub\nlegumes and tree crops. Poleclimbing yam vines, heart-shaped\ntaro leaves, ground-hugging sweet potato vines, and shrublike\nmanioc stems are the only visible signs of the large store of\nstarch staples which is building up underground, while the\ngrain crops fruit a metre or so above the swidden floor before\ngiving way to the more widely-spaced and less-rapidly maturing\ntree-crops."\n\nSpecial Crop: abaca $19,900,000 export value\nLast year\'s production of abaca has been estimated at 620,000 bales\nof 125 kilos each. This is a banana-like perennial supplying a strong\nresilient fiber commonly ;mown as Manila hemp. Shading and weeding is\n\nt\ni\n\ni\n\nnecessary for this crop (which is both wild and cultivated) until it\nt\nL\n\nreaches saturation. Then the stalk is cut and the sheaths are cut into\nstrips to get out the long fiber inside. The fiber strips are then\ndrawn by hand between\n\nthe edge of a knife blade and a wooden plane. as\n\neach drawing maket, the fiber cleaner and finer, producing a high grade\nhemp is largely a matter of hand labor. (Several machines are now in use,\n\nF t.\n\nthough quality is sometimes sacrificed.) Then-the fiber is sun-dried and\nloosely packed into bundles.\n\nt\nk\n\ni\n\nF-12\n\nLot.\n\n^-\t\n\nPHILIMMS\n\nAgricu l tural development needs\nas .rt:s! ify at= .......................\nrel\n\n^oR si_ble ply applications\n\nPalay almost entirely solar dried, \t\nwith high losses due to unequal\ntemperature and humidity causing\ncracking and over-drying\n\ndriers\n\nlittle bulk storage of rice\t\nbecause it requires strict\nmoisture control\n\nventilating fans\n\nfew mechanical driers for maize,\t\nmaize spread on concrete floors\nfor solar drying\n\ndriers\n\nvery few mechanical maize \t\nshellers exist; large increases\nof maize production is expected\nin Mindanao and Cagayan Valley\n\nshellers, mills, driers\n\nCopra kilns are used very\t\ninfrequently; tapahans often\ndry copra unequally and scorch it\n\ncopra driers\n\nmost people won\'t eat fish that \t\nis not fresh; inadequate refrigeration\n\nrefrigeration\n\n$1 million in AID fish culture \t\nproject\t\n\npumps, aerators for fish\npond aquaculture\n\nF-13\n\nSOS\nAID, 1979 "Agricultural Sector Paper."\nAID, March, 1980 conversation with Philippines desk officer, Mr. Nusbaum.\nAsian Development Bank, Asian Agricultural Survey, 19696\nBrandt, Andres, Fish Catching Methods of the World, Fishing Books Ltd.,\nLondon, 1972.\nBurley, T.M., "Mechanization of Asian Agriculture: Its Potentials and\nPitfalls, World Crops (26/2/63).\nForeign Agricultural Service, USDA, Feb. 1980 "Attache Report."\nInternational Association of Agricultural Economists, World Atlas\nof Agriculture, Instituto Geographico de Agostini, Novara, 1976.\nKurian, G.T.
