Agan\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nM.S. 238-420\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91109\nPhone: (818) 354-3887 FAX: (818)354-6825\n\nABSTRACT\nIn the last decade, the demand for reliable data,\nvoice, and video satellite communication\nlinks\nbetween aircraft and ground to improve air traffic\ncontrol, airline management,\nand to meet the\ngrowing demand for passenger communications has\nincreased significantly. It is expected that in the near\nfuture, the spectrum\nrequired for aeronautical\ncommunication\nservices will grow significantly\nbeyond that currently available at L-band.\nIn\nanticipation\nof this, JPL is developing\nan\nexperimental\nbroadband\naeronautical\nsatellite\ncommunications\nsystem that will utilize NASA\'s\nAdvanced Communications\nTechnology\nSatellite\n(ACTS) as a satellite of opportunity\nand the\ntechnology developed under JPL\'s ACTS Mobile\nTerminal (AMT) Task to evaluate the feasibility of\nusing K/Ka-band\nfor these applications.\nThe\napplication of K/Ka-band for aeronautical\nsatellite\ncommunications\nat cruise altitudes is particularly\npromising for several reasons:\n(1) the minimal\namount of signal attenuation due to rain; (2) the\nreduced\ndrag due to the smaller\nK/Ka-band\nantennas\n(as compared to the current L-band\nsystems); and (3) the large amount of available\nbandwidth.\nThe increased bandwidth available at\nthese frequencies is expected to lead to significantly\nimproved passenger communications - including fullduplex compressed\nvideo and multiple channel\nvoice. A description of the proposed broadband\nexperimental system will be presented including: (1)\napplications\nof K/Ka-band aeronautical\nsatellite\ntechnology to U.S. industry; (2) the experiment\nobjectives;\n(3) the experiment\nset-up;\n(4)\nexperimental\nequipment\ndescription;\nand (5)\nindustrial participation in the experiment and the\nbenefits.\n\ntime and operational costs by optimizing the aircraft\'s\nflight path. The latter are likely to be of concern to\nthe airline companies in order to maintain customer\nsatisfaction and allegiance.\nSince 1991, Inmarsat has provided a single channel\npacket data link at 600 bps, nominally, and a single\nchannel voice, data, or FAX link at 9.6 kbps using\nseveral antenna designs.\nBoth channels are\nestablished at L-band using Inmarsat I and II\nsatellites. The American Mobile Satellite Corporation\n(AMSC) will also be providing these services as well.\nFurthermore, both Inmarsat and AMSC have recently\nbegun offering or plan to offer multiple voice and\ndata channel services.\nAs these systems become implemented and more\nwidely used at L-band, and the benefits provided by\ntheir operation are realized, it is likely that the\ncommunication role envisaged for aeronautical\nsatellite communications will grow. Concepts such\nas providing passengers with an "office in the sky,"\ne.g., voice, data, FAX, and compressed video\nteleconferencing, or real-time news and sports\nbroadcast will expand. Air crew services such as realtime transmission of weather maps or compressed\nvideo transmission from the cockpit or cabin for\nsecurity may become attainable. Additional demand\nfor the planned telecommunication\nservices\nmentioned above as well as for these new services\nwill motivate a need for more spectrum than is likely\nto be available at L-band. The application of K/Kaband for aeronautical satellite communications could\nbe used to enhance the mobile satellite capabilities\nat L-band as these demands increase [1].\n\nIn addition to these commercially oriented needs,\nrecent events in the Middle East (Persian Gulf War)\nand other potential hotspots around the world have\nsuggested that the development\nof this type of\nAPPLICATIONS\ntechnology would be extremely beneficial to our\nnation\'s military efforts.\nFor these needs, the\nemphasis would be on providing compressed video\nThere is presently a demand for high quality, reliable,\nvoice and data satellite communication links between .... imaging from an aircraft back to a fixed terminal, as\naircraft and ground to improve air traffic management\nopposed to the commercial emphasis of a broadcast\nservices and to meet the growing demand for\napplication (compressed video imaging from a fixed\npassenger communication services. The former are\nterminal to the aircraft).\nof importance as they should result in increased\npassenger and crew safety and should reduce flight\n\n205\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nThe ACTS Broadband Aeronautical Experiment has\nbeen designed to not only prove the feasibility of\nK/Ka-band\naeronautical\nmobile\nsatellite\ncommunications, but to design the overall system in\na manner that would allow for easy technology\ntransfer to U.S. industry. The aeronautical system\nconfiguration consists of a fixed (ground-based)\nterminal, ACTS, and an aircraft terminal as shown in\nFigure 1.\nThe fixed terminal consists of a\ncommunications\nterminal mated to the High Burst\nRate Link Evaluation Terminal (HBR-LET)\nRF\nhardware including the 4.7 m antenna. The aircraft\nterminal\'s architecture will be similar to that of the\nACTS Mobile Terminal [2]. In the forward direction\n(fixed station-to-aircraft) the fixed terminal will transmit\na data and a pilot signal to ACTS. ACTS will then\ntransmit these signals to the aircraft terminal while\noperating in the Microwave Switch Matrix (MSM)\nmode of operation (a bent pipe mode). The signal in\nthe forward link will be at a maximum data rate of 384\nkbps. On the return link (aircraft-to-fixed station) the\nsignal transmitted from the aircraft terminal will consist\nof a data signal with a maximum data rate of 112 kbps.\nTwo transponders will be utilized on ACTS for this\nexperiment.\nOne transponder\nwill be used to\nsupport the fixed station-to-aircraft\nforward link\nsignals and the other the aircraft-to-fixed\nstation\nreturn link. The first transponder will be configured\nwith the 30 GHz Cleveland fixed beam for the uplink\nand a 20 GHz spot or steerable beam for the\ndownlink to the aircraft. The second transponder will\nbe configured with a 30 GHz spot or steerable beam\nfor the uplink and the 20 GHz Cleveland fixed beam\nfor the downlink.\nEXPERIMENT\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThe primary objectives for the ACTS Broadband\nAeronautical Experiment are to:\n(1) Characterize and demonstrate the performance\nof\nthe\naircraft/ACTSiAMT\nK/Ka-band\ncommunications link for high data rate aeronautical\napplications.\nThis includes the characterization of\nfull-duplex compressed video, and multiple channel\nvoice and data links.\n(2) Evaluate and assess the performance of current\nvideo compression algorithms in an aeronautical\nsatellite communications link.\n(3) Characterize the propagation effects of the K/Kaband channel for aeronautical\ncornmun|cations\nduring take-off, cruise, and landing phases of aircraft\nflight.\n\n2O6\n\n(4) Evaluate and analyze aeronautical\nsatellite\ncommunication system concepts common to both Lband and K/Ka-band communication systems.\n(5) Provide the systems groundwork for an eventual\ncommercial\nK/Ka-band\naeronautical\nsatellite\ncommunication system.\nThe experimental\nsystem performance\nwill be\nevaluated\nboth quantitatively and qualitatively.\nQualitatively, the principal criterion will be the ability\nto maintain a full-duplex video, or multiple channel\nvoice or data link while the aircraft is in the cruise\nphase of flight, as well as during take-off and landing.\nQuantitatively,\nthe link performance\nis a direct\nfunction of the bit error rate (BER). The BER in turn\nis a function of the received signal to noise ratio and\nits stability, frequency offsets including Doppler and\nDoppler rate, and other effects on the link such as\nphase noise, aircraft shadowing,\nand possibly\nmultipath.\nThe quantitative evaluation of system\nperformance will therefore be presented in terms of\ntwo criteria: (1) the ability to maintain a minimum\ngiven received signal level, which is dependent on\nthe performance of the aircraft antenna system in the\naeronautical environment as well as the scanning (or\nsteerable) beam characteristics of ACTS, and (2) the\nBER performance versus received bit signal energy\nto noise density ratio, Eb/N o with the different\nchannel\ndisturbances\nas parameters.\nThe\nquantitative assessment will include a comparison\nbetween theoretical results (analysis and simulation),\nlaboratory\nmeasured\nresults, and experimental\nresults for various channel conditions encountered.\nThe required BER for video codecs is typically\nbetween 10 s and 10 e, higher than is normally\nrequired for voice communications\n(BER of\napproximately 103).\nWhen\noperating at higher\nBER\'s, most video codecs will have serious audio\ndistortion and intermittent video "tiling" effects.\nTherefore, in order to select a suitable video codec,\na tradeoff between required BER for distortionless\noperation and data rate versus the available link\nmargin will be performed. Currently, there are many\ncommercial video compression products available.\nThese products employ a variety of video\ncompression\ntechniques,\nimplemented\nin a\ncombination of hardware and software.\nIdeally,\nseveral video codecs will be tested in this\nexperiment, as none have been designed for\ntransmission over a channel with time-varying\ncharacteristics such as the aeronautical satellite\nchannel.\nThe aeronautical environment is characterized\n(1) large variations in the elevation angle to\nsatellite in the aircraft frame of reference; and\nblockage of the line-of-sight to the satellite by\n\nby:\nthe\n(2)\nthe\n\naircraft structure. Both effects are due to aircraft\nbanking and changes in attitude angle during flight.\nAn in-depth study of these effects will help in future\ndesigns of aeronautical satellite communication\nsystems. Among the system parameters that will be\nmost directly affected by these characterizations are\nthe antenna\nscanning\nangle,\nthe antenna\nbeamwidth, and the antenna placement on the\naircraft. Measurements will be made to characterize\nthe propagation effects due to clouds, possible\naircraft blockage, rain attenuation on both the uplink\nand the downlink, and other environmental\nconditions during take-off, cruise, and landing\nphases of flight. These measurements will be based\non various transmitted and received beacon and pilot\nsignals. An attempt will be made to categorize and\nseparate the sources of channel degradation (cloud\neffects, aircraft obstruction, rain effects, etc.).\nCumulative fade distributions will be computed for\nthe different channel conditions encountered, and\nthe associated terminal performance identified.\nSeveral general aeronautical system (common to\nboth L-band and K/Ka-band aeronautical satellite\ncommunications systems) concepts will be studied\nduring this experiment including: (1) compressed\nvideo transmission and reception techniques; (2)\nmultiple cabin and cockpit channels with call priority\nassignments; and (3) the aeronautical satellite link\nconnection\nwith\nthe\naeronautical\ntelecommunications network. A thorough study of\nthese system parameters will greatly enhance future\naeronautical\nsatellite\nsystem\ndesign\nand\nperformance.\nA study of the compressed video\ntransmission and reception techniques will assess\nthe performance of the video compression units\nover the K/Ka-band mobile satellite communications\nchannel. These units will further be categorized by\nthe subject of the video transmission (Can the video\ncompression unit handle video teleconferencing?\nHow does the unit handle rapid motion?, etc.).\nAnother system concept that will be looked at is the\nmultiple channel system with priority assignment.\nFor this set-up, several data or voice link lines will be\nestablished, with the highest priority being given to\nthe aircraft cockpit, and the lesser priority being\ngiven to passenger communications.\nFinally,\nrecommendations for the design of the aeronautical\nsatellite communications\nequipment\nwill be\naccomplished in a manner such as to ease the\nintegration of the equipment with the Aeronautical\nTelecommunications Network (ATN).\n\nbut also for the satellite design. Specifications for\nthe performance of the terminal subsystems (e.g.,\nmodem and video compression unit) will also be\nincluded in the recommendations.\nSome of the\nsystem specifications will include typical Doppler\noffsets that a commercial\nsystem should be\nexpected to handle, typical scanning angles of the\nantenna subsystem due to the banking motion of\nthe aircraft, as well as the overall performance of the\nvarious video compression units in the presence of a\nK/Ka-band mobile satellite communications channel.\nEXPERIMENT\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThe necessary equipment for this experiment\nincludes an aeronautical mobile terminal, a fixed\nterminal, an aircraft, and ACTS. The aeronautical\nterminal and fixed terminal architectures are similar to\nthat of the AMT for the land-mobile experiments as\ndescribed in [3]. There are, however, several distinct\ndifferences\nbetween\nthe\ntwo\nterminal\ndevelopments:\n(1) the development\nof an\naeronautical antenna that can track in elevation, as\nwell as in azimuth; (2) the development of a higher\nrate modem (up to 384 kbps as opposed to up to 64\nkbps) than for the land-mobile experiments; and (3)\nthe use of a (several) video compression unit(s) in\naddition to a speech codec.\nA more complete\ndescription of this equipment can be found in [2]. A\ndetailed description of ACTS can be found in [4].\n\nFrom the data collected from this experiment, and\nthe ensuing analysis, recommendations about the\ndesign of a practical and cost efficient commercial\nK/Ka-band aeronautical satellite communications\nsystem will be developed. These recommendations\nwill not only include specifications\nfor the\naeronautical and ground communications terminal,\n\n207\n\nLINK\n\nBUDGETS\n\nThe forward (data only) and return link budgets for\nthe experimental configuration\nare .presented in\nTable 1. ACTS\' west scan sector beam is used to link\nto the aircraft; the EIRP and G/T of the edge of beam\ncontours are taken to be 59.00 dBW and 15.00\ndB/\xc2\xb0K, respectively. The accuracy of these values is\n+/-1.00 dB. ACTS\' Cleveland fixed beam is used for\ncommunications with the fixed terminal. The EIRP\nand G/T at the center of the beam are 69.50 dBW\nand 21.25 dB/\xc2\xb0K, respectively.\nThe aeronautical\nterminal\nG/T assumed\nis -5.00 dB/\xc2\xb0K.\nThe\nmodulation scheme assumed is BPSK with a rate\n1/2, constraint length 7, convolutional\ncode, with\nsoft-decision Viterbi decoding.\nA BER of 10 s is\nassumed to be achieved at an Eb/N o of 4.5 dB. A\nloss of 3.00 dB due to modem implementation,\nphase noise, and frequency offset effects are\nassumed.\nOn the forward link both data and pilot\nsignals (equal power) are transmitted (the link budget\nis shown strictly for the data channel). The total fixed\nterminal EIRP is 68.00 dBW. The resulting forward\n(at 384 kbps) and return link performance margins (at\n112 kbps) are 3.29 dB and 2.89 dB, respectively.\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\nRESULTS\n\nAND\n\nBENEFITS\n\nThe development and execution of this experiment\nwill be accomplished in conjunction with U.S.\nindustrial participation.\nA broadband aeronautical\nworking group is being formed to assist with this\neffort. Members of this working group will come from\na wide variety of interests in U.S. industry including:\n(1) aircraft manufacturers, (2) airline carriers, (3)\nsatellite service providers, (4) aeronautical avionics\nmanufacturers, (5) video compression companies,\n(6) broadcasters, (7) other government agencies,\nand (8) government regulators. Input from these\ngroups during the development of the experiment\nwill shape the experiment in a way that will provide for\nan efficient transfer of the technology and system\nconcepts to a commercial venture. Their input will\ninclude: assistance with the experiment conceptual\ndevelopment, equipment development, use and\noperation of an aircraft, and overall experiment\nexecution.\nActive participation by U.S. industry in\nthis experiment\nwill\nhelp to stimulate\nthe\ncommercialization of this service. It is anticipated that\na commercially operated system that would provide\ncompressed video broadcasts for passengers could\nbe in service as early as the turn of the century.\n\n[3]\nAgan, M.J., et al., "The ACTS Mobile\nTerminal:\nPoised for ACTS Launch," IMSC, June\n1993.\n[4]\nWright, D. and Balombin, J., "ACTS System\nCapability and Performance,"\nAIAA Conference\n1992, ppg. 1135 - 1145.\n\nSUMMARY\nThe ACTS Broadband Aeronautical Experiment will\nhelp verify\nthat\nK/Ka-band\nmobile\nsatellite\ntechnology could be useful in meeting increased\ndemands\nfor aeronautical\nmobile\nsatellite\ncommunication services. T_e-minimal\namount of\nsignal attenuation due to rain during the cruise\nphase of flight, the reduced drag due to the smaller\nK/Ka-band antennas (as compared to the current Lband systems), and the large amount of available\nbandwidth make the development of a K/Ka-band\naeronautical mobile satellite system a logical choice\nfor such non-critical passenger services as live video\nbroadcasts of news and sports events, voice, FAX,\ndata, etc. and other needs. Planned active industrial\nparticipation in this experiment will allow for the\nconclusions, technology, and system concepts to\nbe easily transferred to U.S. industry to develop a\ncommercial K/Ka-band aeronautical mobile satellite\ncommunications system.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\nNguyen, T., et al., "ACTS Aeronautical\nExperiments," AIAA Conference 1992, ppg. 17691781.\n[2]\nAbbe, B.S., et al, "ACTS Broadband\nAeronautical Experiment," ACTS Conference 1992.\n\n208\n\n_\n\nKa-BAND\n\nDATA (29.634\n\nAND PILOT (29._\nK-BAND\n\nDATA (19.914\n\nAND PILOT (19.914\nKz.BAND\n\nGHz +/- 150 MHg)\n\nTS\n\nGHz */- 1.50 MHg)\n\nDATA (29.634\n\nJ\n/\n\nK-BAND\n/\n\nGHz\n\nDATA\n\n19.194\n\n+/- 150 MHz)\n\nGHz +l- 150 MHg)__\n_\'\'__\n\nBR-LET\n\nFigure 1 ACTS Broadband Aeronautical Experiment Set-Up\n\n209\n\nGHt _- 150 MHg)\nGHz +I- 150 MHg)\n\nTable\n\n1 Broadband\n\nAeronautical\n\nExperiment\n\nLink Budgets\n\nFORWARD\n\nLINK\n\nRETURN\n\nLINK\n\nPARAMETER\nTransmitter\nParameters\n65.000\n-0.800\n0.000\n\nPolarization Loss_ dB\nG/T_ dB/K\nPointing Loss, dB\nBandwidth, MHz\nReceived\n\nC/N o, dB-Hz\n\nTransponder\nEffective\nEffective\n\nSNRIN, dB\n\nHard Limiter\nHard Limiter\n\nTransmitter\n\nSuppressionr\nSNRou T, dB\n\n-0.850\n15.700\n-0.320\n900.000\n62.780\n\n10.320\n\nr dB\n\n-213.340\n29.634\n37408.000\n-0.360\n\n-O.130\n21.250\n-0.220\n900.000\n99.860\n\nAtmospheric Attenuation\nReceiver Parameters\n\n34.000\n-0.500\n-O.200\n\n-213.480\n29.634\n38000.000\n-0.360\n\nEIRP r dBW\nPointing Loss r dB\nRadome Loss r dB\nPath Parameter_\nSpace Loss_ dB\nFrequency, GHz\nRange, km\n\n-26.770\n-1.050\n-27.820\n\n-5.00O\n5.320\n\ndB\n\nParameters\n\nEIRP, dBW\nPointing LOSS, dB\nPath Parameters\n\n24.180\n-O.220\n\nSpace Loss adB\nFrequency, GHz\nRanger km\nAtmospheric\nAttenuationr\nReceiver Parameters\n\n-209.890\n19.914\n37408.000\n-0.500\n-O.850\n-0.100\n-5.000\n-0.500\n66.640\n\nOverall\nRequired\n\nF_b/N (AWGN),\no\n\nModem Implementation\nLoss Due to Frequency\nRequired Eb/No, dB\n\nLoss, dB\n.Offsets, dB\n\nLoss Due to ACTS Phase Noise_ dB\nData Rate r kbps\nPerformance\nMargin_ dB\n\n210\n\n4.500\n1.000\n1.000\n6.500\n\n1.000\n384.00\n3.290\n\ndB\n\n60.880\n\n1.000\n1.000\n6.500\n\nC/N o, dB-Hz\n\n27.000\n-0.500\n68.400\n\n4.500\n\nPolarization\nLoss_ dB\nRadome Lossr dB\nGfr_ dB/K\n.Pointing Loss_ dB\nDownlink C/N , dB-Hz\n\n-0.130\n\n66.640\n\ndB\n\n-210.030\n19.914\n38000.000\n-0.500\n\n1.000\n112.000\n2.890\n\nSession\nUser\n\n6\n\nRequirements\n\nand Applications\n\nSession Chair--Deanna\nRobinson,\nPacific Advanced Communications\nConsortium,\nUniversity\nof Oregon, U.S.A.\nSession Organizer--John\nSydor, Communications\nResearch\nCentre,\n\nThe FAA Satellite\nKaren L.
