At least 10 percent of the carbon stars have a mass loss rate that has changed by a factor of 2 during the past 1000 years. The stars that are losing large amounts of mass are generally long period variables. All these results are consistent with a two-step process of mass loss from most of the stars with substantial mass-outflow rates.", "title": "Mass loss from carbon stars", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T17:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860050119, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jura, M."}, "organization": {"name": "California, University", "location": "Los Angeles, United States"}}, "id": "d8272803aa514f5e9df7da86e37ab8d8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860050119, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/164077", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "303", "submissionId": 19860050119, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "92ee51e31edf419383728cb3ac21aead", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1986-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
