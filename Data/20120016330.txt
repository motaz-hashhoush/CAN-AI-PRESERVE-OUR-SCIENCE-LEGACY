The\nthe following detailed description of the best modes for cargovernment may have certain rights in the invention.\nrying out the invention when taken in connection with the\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nio accompanying drawings.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nThe present invention relates to the motion control of a\nhumanoid robot, and more specifically an actuation system\nand packaging for an upper arm of the humanoid robot.\n15\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nRobots are automated devices that are able to manipulate\nobjects using a series of rigid links, which in turn are interconnected via articulations or motor-driven robotic joints.\nEach j oint in a typical robot represents an independent control\nvariable, also referred to as a degree of freedom (DOE).\nEnd-effectors are the particular links used for performing a\ntask at hand, e.g., grasping a work tool or an obj ect. Therefore,\nprecise motion control of a robot may be organized by the\nlevel of task specification: object level control, i.e., the ability\nto control the behavior of an object held in a single or cooperative grasp of a robot, end-effector control, and joint level\ncontrol. Collectively, the various control levels cooperate to\nachieve the required robotic mobility, dexterity, and work\ntask-related functionality.\nHumanoid robots in particular are robots having an\napproximately human structure or appearance, whether a full\nbody, a torso, and/or an appendage, with the structural complexity of the humanoid robot being largely dependent upon\nthe nature of the work task being performed. The use of\nhumanoid robots may be preferred where direct interaction is\nrequired with devices or systems that are specifically made\nfor human use. Due to the wide spectrum of work tasks that\nmay be expected of a humanoid robot, different control\nmodes may be simultaneously required. For example, precise\ncontrol must be applied within the different spaces noted\nabove, as well control over the applied torque or force,\nmotion, and the various grasp types.\nIn order to approximate human movement each joint\nwithin the robot requires at least one actuator for each DOE\nAdditionally, these actuators must be packaged in an arrangement that approximately represents human structure and\nappearance.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nAccordingly, rotary actuator assembly is provided herein\nfor actuation of an upper arm assembly for a dexterous\nhumanoid robot. The rotary actuator assembly includes a\nsupport frame defining an axis and a motor mounted about the\naxis within the support frame. A gear drive is rotatably connected to the motor and is also mounted within the support\nframe about the axis. A torsion spring includes a spring input\nand a spring output. The spring input is rotatably connected to\nan output of the gear drive and the spring output is connected\nto a joint output. The torsion spring is mounted within the\nsupport frame.\nAn upper arm assembly for the humanoid robot includes a\nplurality of arm support frames each defining an axis. A\nplurality of rotary actuator assemblies are each mounted to\none of the plurality of arm support frames about the respective\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nFIG.1 is a schematic perspective illustration of a dexterous\nhumanoid robot in accordance with the invention;\nFIG. 2 is schematic perspective illustration of an upper arm\nfor the dexterous humanoid robot of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is schematic perspective illustration of a support\nframe and rotary actuator assembly for one joint of the upper\narm for the dexterous humanoid robot of FIGS. 1 and 2;\nFIG. 4 is a schematic perspective illustration of a rotary\nactuator assembly for the upper arm of the dexterous humanoid robot of FIG. 1-3;\nFIG. 5 is a schematic cross-sectional illustration of the\nrotary series elastic actuator assembly for the dexterous\nhumanoid robot of FIG. 1-4\nFIG. 6 is a schematic cross-sectional illustration of a motor\nand brake for the rotary actuator assembly for the dexterous\nhumanoid robot of FIG. 1-5; and\nFIG. 7 is a schematic perspective view of a rotational\nposition sensor for the rotary actuator assembly for the dexterous humanoid robot of FIG. 1-6.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\nWith reference to the drawings, wherein like reference\nnumbers refer to the same or similar components throughout\nthe several views, FIG. 1 shows a dexterous humanoid robot\n10 adapted to perform one or more tasks with multiple\ndegrees of freedom (DOE).\nThe humanoid robot 10 may include a head 12, torso 14,\nwaist 15, arms 16, hands 18, fingers 19, and thumbs 21, with\nthe various joints being disposed within or therebetween.

A power supply 13 may be integrally mounted to the\nrobot 10, e.g., a rechargeable battery pack carried or worn on\nthe back of the torso 14 or another suitable energy supply, to\nprovide sufficient electrical energy to the various joints for\nmovement of the same.\nAccording to one embodiment, the robot 10 is configured\nwith a plurality of independently and interdependentlymoveable robotic joints, such as but not limited to a shoulder\njoint assembly (arrow A), an elbow joint assembly (arrow B),\na wristj oint assembly (arrow C), a neckjoint assembly (arrow\nD), and a waist joint assembly (arrow E), as well as the\nvarious finger joint assemblies (not numbered) positioned\nbetween the phalanges of each robotic finger 19.\nEach robotic joint may have one or more DOE For\nexample, certain joints such as the shoulder joint assembly\n(arrow A) and elbow joint assembly (arrow B) may have at\nleasttwo DOE inthe form ofpitchandroll. Likewise, theneck\njoint assembly (arrow D) may have at least three DOE, while\nthe waist and wrist assemblies (arrows E and C, respectively)\nmay have one or more DOE Depending on task complexity,\n\nUS 8,291,788 B2\n3\n\n4\n\nthe robot 10 may move with over 40 DOE.
