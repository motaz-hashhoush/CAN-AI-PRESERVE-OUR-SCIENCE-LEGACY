In terms of the strength of the constituents, this potential is comparable to that of fiber reinforced composites. Many combinations of laminated materials can be envisioned that could be advantageously\nfabricated into parts or components of structures.\nThe potential of laminar composites can be illustrated by the properties of two recently developed\nprototype systems:\nThe first prototype consisted of laminae of the\noxidation resistant alloy Nichrome V alternated with\ntungsten (the reinforcing or stronger phase). These\ncomposites contained nominally 50 volume percent of\neach material as foil or sheets of 0.025, 0.125, or 0.50\nmm (0.001, 0.005 or 0.020 inch) thickness At test\ntemperatures of 1144 K (16000 F) and under all\ntest conditions, these composites had strengths equal\nto or considerably above the values calculated for\nthem using rule-of-mixtures equations, based on the\nindividual strengths of the tungsten and Nichrorne V.\nAt 1366 K (2000 F) for most short-time test conditions\n(less than 10 hours), the composites had strengths above\nthe calculated "rule-of-mixtures" strengths. For 100 hour\nlife, the strength of the thickest (0.5 mm-0.020 inch) laminae composite equaled the "rule-of-mixtures" strength.\nThe second prototype consisted of a laminar composite of 77 volume percent W-Re-Hf-C alloy sheet\nalternated with 23 volume percent Inconel 600 foil.\nThis composite had a 1366 K (2000\xc2\xb0 F) tensile strength\nof 6.83 x 108 N/rn2 (99,000 psi) and an extrapolated\n100 hour stress-rupture strength of about 3.4 x 108\nN/rn 2 (50,000 psi). These values compare favorably\nwith some fiber composite materials which have been\ndeveloped.\n\nThese two prototype composites have demonstrated\nthat laminar metal-metal composites have a potential\nfor high strength and high temperature applications\nsimilar to that demonstrated for metal-fiber-metal matrix\ncomposites. These two composites, intended as demonstration prototypes, were made from available materials\nrather than materials specifically selected for maximum\nperformance as laminar composites; the results, however, indicate that practical high-performance laminar\ncomposites can probably be designed. The results also\nindicate that the development of stronger reinforcing\nlaminae designed specifically for laminar composite use\ncould result in even higher strength composites.\nBecause laminar composites have several valuable\nintrinsic characteristics, they may be more desirable for\ncertain applications than fiber composites. For example,\nthey probably can be made with less in-plane anisotropy\nthan fiber composites without sacrificing maximum\nstrength or modulus. Less in-plane anisotropy should\nenable laminar composites to withstand high transient\nstresses arising from impact, fatigue, etc., while providing a higher safety factor. Generally, too it is believed that laminar composites may be less expensive\nto produce than comparable fiber composites.\nApplications for laminar composites are numerous.\nLaminar composites can be designed or "tailor made"\nfor specific applications, and to have specific properties\nsuch as corrosion resistance, strength, modulus, hightemperature strength, impact resistance, and ease of\nfabrication. One of the most promising potential uses\nfor laminar composites, compared to bulk materials or\nfiber composites, is in high-speed, high-temperature\nturbines. For example, disks for the multiple turbine\nand compressor stages may possibly be made with\nlaminated materials. Other aerospace applications might\n\n.\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
