The\ninverse of barometric\npressure\nwas used as the third dimension.\nSeveral 3DPR animations\nof cloud cover and altitude have been produced.\nII.\n\nImprovement\nof 3DPR capabilities:\nImprovements\nwith was ease of use (A thru D below), next came\nquality\nA.\n\nB.\n\nof the rendering\n\n(F & G below).\n\nOriginal FORTRAN\ncode\nwith pre-computed\n"flight"\nThe VICAR\n\nhave come in 3 categories.\nThe first to be dealt\nspeed of rendering\n(E below) and t\'mally the\n\nversion\n\nfrom Kobrick required\nparameter\ntables.\n\nof render\n\nwas re-written\n\nfixed input\n\nand output\n\nin C and allows variable\n\nimage\n\nsizes along\n\nsized inputs\n\nand\n\noutputs.\n(Largest inputs and outputs used to date are: 20,000 lines by 14,000 samples\ninput,\nand an output image size of 3100 lines by 4200 samples).\nThere are no set size limits.\nC.\n\nInteractive\n\n"Flight" parameter\n\nselection\n\n144\n\nsoftware\n\nwritten:\n\nThe program\n\n3DI\n\n(three-dimensional\ninteractive)\nis used to select the viewing parameters.\n3DI graphically\nrepresents the parameters on a workstation display monitor and allows the user to change\nthem interactively.\nOnce satisfied with the changes, the user can preview the resulting\n3DPR image as calculated from the actual input images to be used for the animation.\nAfter\npreviewing,\nthe parameters and/or previews may be saved for later application.\n3DI is not\nused to generate the movie frames because it works on a scaled down version of the original\ninput image and elevation data. This is done to greatly reduce the amount of processing\nspeed\nDo\n\nneeded\n\nthe previews.\n\n"L.

This represents\na speed-up\nof\n189 times.\nIn addition to the speed up, the animation\nquality was greatly improved\nby\nreducing\n\nF.\n\nhigh frequency\n\naliasing\n\nMultiple\nRays per pixel: For\none) are extended\nfrom the\nintersect\nthe surface defined\nintersects\nwith the surface.\n\nIV.\n\npixei.
