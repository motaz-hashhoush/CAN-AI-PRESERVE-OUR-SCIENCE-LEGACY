This permits the locking balls to drop into\nthe detents and thus free the separation link.\nNotes:\n1. A prototype device has a load handling capability\nto 75,000 pounds. Rescaling would give the device\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\na wide range of applications for retaining and\nquickly releasing loads.\nWith minor modifications this separator could be\nused as a coupling device.\nInquiries concerning this innovation may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nKennedy Space Center\nKennedy Space Center, Florida 32899\nReference: B66-10294\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: D.
