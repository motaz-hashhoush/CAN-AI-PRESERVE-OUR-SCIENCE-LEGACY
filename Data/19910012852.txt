Tentative performance specifications for systems that\nmight be built in the early part of the _enty-first century were established. Fh-eliminarystudies of\nsystem design and missior, prone led to the consideration of the Sun-F_.arthollinear transterrestrial\nc\nlibration point (SEL2) as .theideal ope,ationai location for the system. Moreover, compatibility\nwith current conti_gency plans for technology development in the geostationary orbit suggests that\nfabrication and a:_;emblyof major components of space-based antenna systems that might be built\nin the early part vf the next cemury would most likely take place in that orbit, Consequently,\ndeployment of \'ti\'_cseomponents to the operational location at SEL2 would require, first of all, an\nc\norbit transfer at ._e,>_,]ncbaxmous\naltitude to the ecliptic plane, and then a transfer from the resulting\necliptic geosynchm:Jous departure orbit to the heliocentric operational ,.,,i)itat SEL2. Because both\nmajor comFonents (dish and shield)of the antenna system would have structural configurations (of\nthe shallow..sheEdnd flat-plate type, respectively) that are associated with high v#ues of the area-toa\nmass ratio, the possibility of com[xment deployment in the ecliptic plane by means of solar saJEng\nwas early recognize& A literature review of papers and other publications dealing with Earthorbiting and interplar:etary solar-sailing missions was then conducted; however, relevant\ninformation concerning suiiable attkude-control laws for solar-sai!tng flight to SEL2, and\nassc_iated flight times, could not be obtainS. For this reason, independent studies of ,.heecliptic\nsolar-sailing transfer problem from the geosynchronous departure orbit to SEL2 have been\nconducted in recent years in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Hawaii\nat Manoa. These s,\'._,2 were based en a _eladvely simple mathematical model describing at_tddeies\ncontrolled spacecraf, motion in the ecliptic plane as governed by solar and terr2strial gravitational\nattractions together with ate solar radiation pressure. The resulting equations of n\',otion have been\nintegrated numerically for zxrelevant range of values of spacecraft _ea-to-mass ratio (as obtained\nfrom preliminary estimates for dish and shield established in eaaFer work) and for an appropriate\nspacecr\',fftattitude-control,law known to lead to E,xrthescape (as obtained from perusal of the solarsailing literature). Expcrtmentation with vatyir.giniti.-dconditions in the departure orbiL and with\nattitude-control law modification after having achieve\xc2\xa3 Fzrth escape, has established the feasibility\nof component deployment by means of solar sailing.
