This is especially true with reworked\nlead-free CSP-100, reworked lead-free BGA-225\n\n\xc2\xb7 Combine Environments Testing\nFrom this testing, it appears the selection of component type and lead-free\nsolder combinations should be considered critical factors when considering\nconverting to lead-free solder assembly, especially for surface mount\ntechnology design configurations.\nBoa rd Fini sh\n\nCom\n\nent\n\nManufactured\nTest Vehicles\n\nFini sh\n\nSolder\nSAC305\n\nSAC405\nIm.
