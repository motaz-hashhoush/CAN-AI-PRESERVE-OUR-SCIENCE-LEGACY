Application of these techniques to multi-vehicle control is described. In several operational environments from small drone delivery to air taxi to autonomous cargo, many companies will need technologies that will allow for the operation of an unmanned aircraft (UAS or eVTOL) by a small crew of individuals that are located in a remote network operations center. That is, Multiple operators supervising an increasing Number of vehicles (M:N). This will require a new control/supervisory paradigm where the supervisors team with automation to achieve their joint tasks; Human Autonomy Teaming (HAT). This task will follow the HAT philosophy and tenants (e.g., trust, bi-directional communication, pilot directed interfaces). It will also develop and employ specific HAT tools (e.g., playbook, working agreements, predictive timeline displays, transparent interfaces to build trust). This presentation discusses the future of GCS control stations and need for Human Systems Integration.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20220006208, "endDate": "2022-04-28T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "2657299422a65c7689f30e1e9b32721f", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International", "location": "Arlington, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8ff9a63c996344419b11159a058a5acc", "id": "d4290da75992440c8d293dfb869f07ad"}], "name": "Xponential 2022", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "8ff9a63c996344419b11159a058a5acc", "url": "https://www.xponential.org/xponential2022/Public/Content.aspx?ID=3746&sortMenu=101002&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=XPO22&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7qDJzeTz9gIVGebjBx2v5giSEAAYASAAEgLB3PD_BwE", "startDate": "2022-04-25T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "future.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220006208/downloads/future.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220006208/downloads/future.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220006208/downloads/future.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
