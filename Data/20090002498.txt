b'Historic Partnership Captures Our Imagination\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nT\n\nFamous for its broadcast of greetings on Christmas Eve of 1968 as the crew circled the Moon, Apollo 8 was the first manned\nmission ever to reach escape velocity. This classic photo of Earth and the lunar surface was taken with a 270-millimeter lens on\na Hasselblad camera, and has been heralded as one of the greatest photos of the 20th century by the likes of Time, Life, Sky\nand Telescope, and other magazines. While frequently printed with the Earth above the lunar surface, the orientation is original\nand reflects the view of the crew.\n\n100\t Consumer, Home, and Recreation\t\n\nimeless, beautiful, and haunting images: A delicate\nblue marble floating in the black sea of space; a\nbrilliant white astronaut suit, visor glowing gold,\nthe entire Earth as a backdrop; the Moon looming large\nand ghostly, pockmarked with sharp craters, a diaphanous\ngrey on deep black. Photographs from space illustrating\nthe planet on which we live, the space surrounding it, and\nthe precarious voyages into it by our fellow humans are\namong the most tangible products of the Space Program.\nThese images have become touchstones of successive\ngenerations, as the voyages into space have illuminated\nthe space in which we live.\nIn 1962, Walter Schirra blasted off in a Mercury\nrocket to become the fifth American in space, bringing\nwith him the first Hasselblad camera to leave the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\natmosphere, recently purchased from a camera shop near\nJohnson Space Center in Houston\xe2\x80\x94but not the last. The\ncamera, a Hasselblad 500C, was a standard consumer\nunit that Schirra had stripped to bare metal and painted\nblack in order to minimize reflections. Once in space,\nhe documented the wonder and awe-inspiring beauty\naround him, and brought the images back for us to share.\nThe Hasselblad 500C cameras were used on this and the\nlast Project Mercury mission in 1963. They continued\nto be used throughout the Gemini space flights in 1965\nand 1966.\nSince then, a number of different camera models have\nbeen put to use, but the images taken with the boxy,\nblack Hasselblads have remained true classics. Noted for\nthe amazing sharpness of the photos, the Hasselblads\nstood up to the rigors of operating in space, facing from\n-65 \xc2\xb0C to over 120 \xc2\xb0C in the sun. Many shots have become\nhistoric treasures: the first spacewalk during the Gemini\nIV mission in 1965; the first venture to another celestial\nbody during Apollo VIII, including the iconic \xe2\x80\x9cEarthrise\xe2\x80\x9d\nphotograph; and the first landing on the surface of the\nMoon during Apollo XI. These pictures were published\nSpinoff 2008\n\nThe ELS is a modified 553 ELX, with flash metering removed\nand leatherette replaced with thin metal plates. This camera\nwas used in the early 1990s on the space shuttle missions.\nThe film magazines use 70-millimeter perforated film and\nare equipped with electronic data imprinting, enabling the\nrecording of time and picture number for each exposure.\n\naround the world, and have become some of the most\nrecognizable and powerful photographs known.\nSeveral different models of Hasselblad cameras have\nbeen taken into space, often modified in one way or\nanother to ease use in cramped conditions and while\nwearing space suits, such as replacing the reflex mirror\nwith an eye-level finder.\n\nPartnership\nVictor Hasselblad AB, of Gothenburg, Sweden, has\nenjoyed a very long-lived collaboration with NASA.\nWorking primarily with Johnson, the last four decades\nhave seen a frequent exchange of ideas between Hasselblad\nand NASA via faxes, telephone calls, and meetings both\nin Sweden and the United States. Initially, most meetings\nwere held at Hasselblad headquarters in Gothenburg, to\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the United States\nflag.

Since then,\ncollaboration with NASA has allowed what was once a\nvery small company in international terms to achieve\nworldwide recognition. Hassleblad\xe2\x80\x99s operations now\ninclude centers in Parsippany, New Jersey; and Redmond,\nWashington; as well as France and Denmark.\nOne direct development of this partnership, the\n553ELS, is the space version of the 553ELX model, available commercially for years. This camera has adopted\nseveral key features and improvements, such as: the\nfixation of the mirror mechanism was removed from the\nrear plate to the side walls; aluminum plating replaced\nthe standard black leatherette as the outer covering; the\nstandard 5-pole contact was replaced by a special 7-pole\ncontact equipped with a bayonet locking device; and the\nbattery cover was equipped with a hinge. These changes\nresulted in increased durability and reliability, and the\nELS model has seen frequent use in the shuttle program.\nHasselblad incorporated and refined other modifications by NASA technicians into new models, such as a\n70mm magazine developed to meet Space Program needs.\nCamera modifications included new materials and lubricants to cope with the vacuum conditions outside the\nspacecraft, and often improved reliability and durability\nof the cameras. In addition, technicians modified camera\nelectronics to meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s special demands for handling\nand function, reconstructing lenses and adding large tabs\nto the focusing and aperture rings to ease handling with\nthe large gloves of an astronaut suit in zero gravity.\n\nProduct Outcome\n\nEarth resembles a child\xe2\x80\x99s marble in this amazing photo, taken during the Apollo 17 mission. NASA officially credits the\nimage to the entire crew, Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Jack Schmitt, all of whom took photographic images with the\nonboard Hasselblad.\n\n102\t Consumer, Home, and Recreation\t\n\nFor over four decades, Hasselblad has supplied camera\nequipment to the NASA Space Program, and Hasselblad\ncameras still take on average between 1,500 and 2,000\nphotographs on each space shuttle mission. Just as the\nremarkable pictures on the surface of the Moon defined\nan era, the fine pictures of astronauts at work in and\naround the shuttles and International Space Station (ISS)\nSpinoff 2008\n\nhave helped define the latest era of man\xe2\x80\x99s continued\nexploration of the universe around us.\nLikewise, the commercial line of Hasselblad cameras\ncontinues to incorporate lessons learned from these voyages. Consumer models have enjoyed such refinements\nas the revised fixation of the mirror mechanism\xe2\x80\x94the\nHasselblad 503CW still features the space-influenced\nimproved mirror mechanism\xe2\x80\x94a design change that\ngave far better stability for the mirror assembly, and an\nenlarged exposure button, similar to the one designed for\nthe space models.\nIn October 2001, the Space Shuttle Discovery, in\naddition to transporting modules to the ISS, carried a new\nHasselblad space camera: a focal-plane shutter camera\nbased on the standard commercial version (203FE)\nequipped with data imprinting along the edge of the film\nframe, enabling the recording of time and picture number\nfor each exposure. Since the computers onboard have full\ncontrol over the position of the shuttle, identification\nof the exact location captured in a frame has become\nmuch easier.\nNow that NASA is returning to the Moon and is also\nlooking on to Mars for the next stage of exploration, it\nis without doubt that Hasselblad cameras will be along\nto document the voyages for those of us remaining on\nEarth. The relationship that began in a camera shop in\nHouston, blossomed on the Moon, and matured on the\nspace shuttle, now prepares to reach new heights. As one\nmore small step for a man and giant leap for mankind\napproaches, we anxiously await the photographs. v\n\nOn February 7, 1984, astronaut Robert Gibson used a Hasselblad camera to take this picture of astronaut Bruce McCandless II,\nwhen he became the first person to fly untethered in space. McCandless traveled more than 300 feet from the Space Shuttle\nChallenger, 150 nautical miles above Earth.\n\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\nConsumer, Home, and Recreation\t 103\n\n'
