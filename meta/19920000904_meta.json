The question of appropriate polarization for the spacecraft as well as for the User Terminal Antenna required particular attention and was studied in some depth. Circular polarization seems to be the favored outcome of this study. Another problem that has generally been a complicating factor in designing the multiple beam reflector antennas, is the type of feeds (single vs. multiple element and overlapping vs. non-overlapping clusters) needed for generating the beams. This choice is dependent on certain system design factors, such as the required frequency reuse, acceptable interbeam isolation, antenna efficiency, number of beams scanned, and beam-forming network (BFN) complexity. This issue is partially addressed, but is not completely resolved. Indications are that it may be possible to use relatively simple non-overlapping clusters of only a few elements, unless a large frequency reuse and very stringent isolation levels are required.", "title": "Spacecraft Antennas", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920000904, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jamnejad, Vahraz"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "9e03c82747204eae84bf5bcd17f5bcf7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920000904, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Manshadi, Farzin"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "38f0d1e960694416a68a475f1230dc3e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920000904, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rahmat-Samii, Yahya"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "4948dd16cf654939b5f6f7fcc3f764ed"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920000904, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cramer, Paul"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "8e511035cf1f42b08a92cfce30fafb8b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920000904, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920000904, "id": "808bc8159fca457093b7145e53594ba6", "publicationName": "Personal Access Satellite System (PASS) Study.
