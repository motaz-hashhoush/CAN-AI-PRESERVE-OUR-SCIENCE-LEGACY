Owen\nPrincipal Investigator\nInstitute for Astronomy\nUniversity of Hawaii\n\nFINAL PROJECT REPORT\nOUTER SOLAR SYSTEM NOMENCLATURE\n1\\AGW 2153\n\nThe Principal Investigator\'s responsibilities on this grant fall into two\ncategories according to his participation in the nomenclature work of the\nlnternational Astronomical Union (IAU). , Owen is chair of the Task Group\nfor the Outer Solar System. He is also a member of the IAU\'s Working Group\non Planetary and Satellite Nomenclature (WGPSN), which is composed of\nthe chairs of the several Task Groups plus the presidents of two IAU\nCommissions and several outside consultants. The WGPSN is presider over\nby its President, Professor Kaare Aksnes from the Rosseland Institute for\nTheoretical Astrophysics in Oslo, Norway.\nDuring the period under review, the major activity for the Outer Solar\nSystem Task Group (OSSTG) was the supervision of new nomenclature for\nsurface features on the satellites of Jupiter, required by scientists on the\nGalileo Mission. The Galileo orbiter cameras have detected many features\nnot seen by Voyager that require names. The categories for these names were\nestablished by the Task Group during the Voyager era, and it has been possible\nto maintain these categories for the new features, simply by adding names to\nexisting name banks, except in the case of Io. The number of new features on\nIo has exceeded the capacity of the categories to produce names, so a new\ncategory \xe2\x80\xa2-- names from Dante\'s Inferno --- has been added. All of this work\nwas done in close collaboration with Jennifer Blue of the USGS in Flagstaff,\nAZ, who maintains the official name banks.\nThe OSSTG has approved the use of native American names for\nfeatures on the surface of Titan and suitable :tames from this source must\nnow be found and an appropriate name bank established. It is envisaged to\ninclude names from other pre-European inhabitants of other countries in this\nname bank.\nIn his ca pacity as a member of the WGPSN, Owen played an active role\nin the selection of craters on Mars to commemorate Alfred O. C. Nier, James\nPollac:; and Harold Masursky, ultimately identifying the craters that were\nchosen in each case. He is now working with Mars Task Group Chair,\nBradford Smith to find a suitable feature on Mars to commemorate Carl\nSagan, and with WGPSN president Kaare Aksnes to find a feature on the\nmoon for Eugene Shoemaker.\nOwen organized an informal meeting of the WGPSN in Honolulu in\nOctober 1997 which was attended by Smith, Aksnes and Merton Davies. He\nwill attend the next formal meeting of this group at COSPAIt in japan in July\n1998.\n\nTCO:dst3/6/98\n\n[REPRODUCTION- QUALITY NOTICE\nWe use state-of-the-art high speed document scanning and\nreproduction equipment.
