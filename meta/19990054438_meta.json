It thus is interested in what price a new technology aircraft would carry to make it attractive to the buyer. But what price a given airplane or helicopter will carry is largely a reflection of the manufacturer's assessment of the competitive market into which the new aircraft will be introduced. The manufacturer must weigh any new aerodynamic or system technology innovation he would add to an aircraft by the impact of this innovation upon the aircraft's economic attractiveness and price. The intent of this paper is to give price standards against which new technologies and the NASA's research program can be assessed. Using reported prices for general aviation, helicopter, and transport aircraft, price estimating relations in terms of engine and airframe characteristics have been developed. The relations are given in terms of the aircraft type, its manufactured empty weight, engine weight, horsepower or thrust. Factors for the effects of inflation are included to aid in making predictions of future aircraft prices. There are discussions of aircraft price in terms of number of passenger seats, airplane size and research and development costs related to an aircraft model, and indirectly as to how new technologies, aircraft complexity and inflation have affected these.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "German Democratic Republic", "submissionId": 19990054438, "endDate": "1978-05-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Allied Weight Engineers, Inc.", "location": "La Mesa, CA United States"}}, "meetingId": "3ac56a75db3d41aabf5a7f5f82012772", "id": "238f1321a9e24c9aba8d941b39d234f2"}], "name": "Annual Conference of the Society of Allied Weight Engineers", "location": "Munich", "id": "3ac56a75db3d41aabf5a7f5f82012772", "startDate": "1978-05-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990054438, "id": "5fa93e12419645b69e39d283efbef31f", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
