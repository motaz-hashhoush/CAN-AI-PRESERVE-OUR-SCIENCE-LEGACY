b"Emerging Fuel Cell Technology Being\nDeveloped--Offers Many Benefits to Air\nVehicles\nFuel cells, which have recently received considerable attention for terrestrial applications\nranging from automobiles to stationary power generation, may enable new aerospace\nmissions as well as offer fuel savings, quiet operations, and reduced emissions for current\nand future aircraft. NASA has extensive experience with fuel cells, having used them on\nmanned space flight systems over four decades. Consequently, the NASA Glenn Research\nCenter has initiated an effort to investigate and develop fuel cell technologies for multiple\naerospace applications.\nTwo promising fuel cell types are the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide\nfuel cell (SOFC). PEM technology, first used on the Gemini spacecraft in the sixties,\nremained unutilized thereafter until the automotive industry recently recognized the\npotential. PEM fuel cells are low-temperature devices offering quick startup time but\nrequiring relatively pure hydrogen fuel. In contrast, SOFCs operate at high temperatures\nand tolerate higher levels of impurities. This flexibility allows SOFCs to use hydrocarbon\nfuels, which is an important factor considering our current liquid petroleum infrastructure.\nHowever, depending on the specific application, either PEM or SOFC can be attractive.\nAs only NASA can, the Agency is pursuing fuel cell technology for civil uninhabited aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) because it offers enhanced scientific capabilities, including enabling highaltitude, long-endurance missions. The NASA Helios aircraft demonstrated altitudes\napproaching 100,000 ft using solar power in 2001, and future plans include the\ndevelopment of a regenerative PEM fuel cell to provide nighttime power. Unique to\nNASA's mission, the high-altitude aircraft application requires the PEM fuel cell to\noperate on pure oxygen, instead of the air typical of terrestrial applications.\nFuel cells may also benefit conventional UAVs by providing greater power for payload\nand/or emergency backup. Adding power to current UAV platforms used for Earth\nscience missions would allow more instrumentation, higher data-scan rates, and higher\ndata-transmission rates to enhance scientific missions. Both PEM and SOFC are potential\ncandidates, with SOFC offering the advantage of utilizing a single, conventional liquid\nfuel.\nIn addition, NASA is pursuing fuel cell technology for aircraft power generation on\ncommercial transports. Power for systems necessary to fly the aircraft and accommodate\npassengers traditionally relies on auxiliary power units and power extracted from the main\nengines. Future commercial aircraft will incorporate more electric aircraft architectures\nand will use fuel cells. Challenges remain, however, to successfully apply the technology\nto commercial flight systems. Fuel processing is critical because the commercial\ntransportation sector will depend on hydrocarbon fuel for the foreseeable future. High-\n\ntemperature SOFCs are best suited because of the similarity in operating temperature with\nthe fuel reformation process, and they enable hybrid configurations (SOFC and\nturboalternator) to increase efficiency. There are other challenges with unique aircraft\nrequirements: improving the specific power of the stack, reducing the weight of the\nremaining components, and investigating flight-operation conditions.\nRealizing the full benefits of fuel cells for aerospace applications will require a\ncollaborative effort. Through workshops and technical/programmatic interchanges, Glenn\nhas begun to facilitate and foster the required national partnership with the Department of\nEnergy, the Department of Defense, State governments, academia, and the aerospace and\nfuel cell industries.\nGlenn contacts: Anita D.
