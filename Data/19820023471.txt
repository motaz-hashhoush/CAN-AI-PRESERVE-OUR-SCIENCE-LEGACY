Near first\napogee,the spin axis is reoriented to Apogee Motor Firing (AMF)\nattitude. The spacecraft is a stable spinner throughout transfer\norbit, and no active nutation control is required. Near fifth\napogee, a preburn maneuver is performed to augment the Apogee Kick\nMotor (AKM). AMF occurs near the equator crossing at seventh\napogee, at a longitude of 152 o W. TTS and TTAC tracking stations\nhave ADS before seventh apogee and can see the satellite during\nAMF.\nInjection into transfer orbit occurs 23.5 minutes after lift-off,\nat about D O W longitude. Approximately 37 minutes later, the\nsatellite crosses the horizon at TTS and acquisition procedures may\nImmediately following ADS, telemetry is analyzed to\nbegin.\t\ndetermine spacecraft health and commandability aoi accelerometer\ndata is examined to measure nutation induced by PMF. A\nreorientation maneuver, using a pulsed axial Reaction Control\nSystem (RCS) thruster, begins soon after the reception of Earth\nsensor data.\nNear equator crossing of the fifth apogee, a preburn maneuver of 86\nm/s is executed to augment the AKM motor. This maneuver raises the\ntransfer orbit perigee from 185 km to 808 km, increasing the period\nJust before\nby 12 minutes, and reduces the inclination to 22 0 .\t\nequator crossing at seventh apogee, at 152 O W longitude, the AKM is\nIf errors in the PKM\nfired, placing the satellite into drift orbit. \t\nperformance or pointing cause AMF longitude to be farther west than\n152 0 , AMF may be delayed until the ninth apogee.\nThe AMF occurs just before the equator crossing at the seventh\napogee, unless dispersions cause a delay until the ninth apogee,\nand is a 30-second burn generating 1.625 km/sec of velocity increThe drift orbit which\nment from 510 kg o f solid propellant.\t\nresults has an apogee bias of 555 km, a perigee bias of -500 km,\nand a westward drift rate of -3.70/day.\n\nDRIFT ORBIT\n\nAfter AMF, the nominal drift orbit has the following parameters:\nPerigee Bias of -500 km, Apogee Bias of 555 km, Mean Drift Rate\nof -3.7 0 W/day, and Inclination of 0.020.\n\n6\n\nt IL\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\nAcquisition of geostationary orbit at 104 0 W requires two major\n\nand related procedures: circularization and station acquisition.\nCircularization is a process of removing the apogee and perigee\nbiases from the drift orbit. \t\nIn principle, it is achieved by a\npositive tangential burn at apogee, and a negative one at perigee.\nTo do this, the satellite spin axis must first be reoriented into\nthe orbit plane, in the positive tangential direction, a reorientation of 23 0 . After the first maneuver of the pair, a continuous\naxial burn of 15 a,/s, the drift rate rises to -15 0 /day. The\n\nsecond maneuver, of almost equal magnitude, must be done at\nperigee; i.e., some odd multiple of 1/2 orbit period after the\nfirst maneuver.\nUpon completion of the circularization maneuvers, the satellite will\nbe in a near-circular orbit, drifting toward station at aporoximately -4 0 /day. At thi; p oint, the spin axis can be erected to\norbit-normal by a reorientation through 90 0 . Once thus configured,\n\nthe tracking station (TTAC) has continuous acquisition of the omni\nantenna and deployment and testing may begin. To acquire the\nstation lonjitude of 104 0 W, the drift rate and eccentr;city are\n\ncorrected by pulse firing of the radial thrusters.\nAfter erection, the deployment sequence to final configuration may\nbegin.\t\nNext, squibs are fired to release four launch locks which\nhold the despun shelf to the spun shelf. Despin is effected by two\nmotors, one of which is turned off when the platform rate is equal\nand opposite to the rotor rate. This maneuver takes about 3\nminutes.\t\nNutation control is provided by the Active Nutation\nControl (ANC) system during the above steps.\nNow squibs are fired to release the launch locks which hold the\nantenna reflector down on top of the platform during launch and\ntransfer orbit.\t\nOne of the redundant Anter;na Positioning\nMechanisms (APM\'s) is used to drive the reflector through 70 0 to\n\nits operational position.\nSquibs are fired to release launch locks, and the aft panel is\ndriven down and is locked at the fullest extent of the Solar Drum\nPositioner (SDP) system. On completion of this phase, heaters\nand other hardware are commanded on for on-orbit operation.\nOnce deployed on station, spacecraft wobble is measured and\ncorrected by differential stepping of the SDP. Testing of the\nbus systems and communication system are carried out both in\ndrift orbit and on station to verify that all performance parameters meet their specifications.\n\nPRIM\n\n\t\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nORIGINAL PAC- 4t;\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\nSPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Telesat-G (Anik-D1) spacecraft is a spin-stabilized 24 channel\nsatellite, built by Hughes Aircraft Co.,shown in Figure 3. \t\nIt\nutilizes two concentric cylindrical solar panels,and when the\nouter panel is deployed downward, the combination provides the\npower required by the communication task.\n\nTELESAT-G CONFIGURATION\n\nDESPUN\nANTENNA`.-\n\nSTOWED\nANTENNA\t\n\n%^ J\n\ni\nI\ni\t\n\nI\t\ni\n\nTHERMAL\n\nRAOIATIN\nBANO\n\nI\n\nEXTENOiBLE\t\n\n1.\n\nS:\'LARPANEL^\n\nC\n1\n\nSOLAR PO%\n\n1\nI\n\nARRAY\n\nI\n\n7\t\n\ne\n\nOPERATIONAL C3NFiGURA7\'CN\n\nALNCH CONIF;GURATiON\n\nFig. 3\n\nThe Telesat-G (Anik-01) spacecraft, shown in an exploded view in\nFigure 4, is 85.3 inches in diameter, 2E.7 inches high when the\nsolar panel and antenna are deployed and weighs 2730 lbs. after PAM\nseparation and injection into the transfer orbit.

Each of the 24 transponders or channels is 36\nMHz wide and designed to accommodate either analog FM transmissions\nor digital transmissions.\nA compact antenna system is achieved by positioning two offset\nparaboloids, each 71 inches in diameter and having a 60 inch focal\nlength, one in front of the other so as to share a common aperture.\nThe front paraboloid reflecting surface is a grid of parallel\nconductors (oriented horizontally) which allows orthogonally\npolarized waves to pass through with little attenuation. \t\nThe rear\nreflector has a vertically oriented grid as its reflecting surface.\nGeometries of the two paraboloids are chosen to provide a displaced focus permitting the use of separate feed systems (for\nhorizontal and vertical polarizations) for maximum beam shaping\nefficiency.\nTelemetry and command signals are accessed through a pair of\ndeployable C-band omni antennas. The omni antennas deployment is\ntwo-stage: the first deployment is of the upper mast and occurs\nduring transfer orbit; the second deployment occurs during reflector\ndeployment when the satellite reaches its geosynchronous orbit\nlocation.\t\nThe second deployment is such that the omni antenna mast\nremains parallel to the spin axis during the entire deployment\nmaneuver. Thus, acquisition of telemetry and command signals\nthrough the omni antennas is continuous during all spacecraft\ndeployments and maneuvers.\nThe telemetry, command/track, and ranging subsy stem orovid p s the\nground command capability and the spacecraft p e r formance and status\ninformation required to properly control the spacecraft. \t\nThe\n\n11\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nsubsystem also provides single axis spacecraft communications\nantenna pointing information to the attitude control subsystem\n(ACS) by monopulse tracking the command uplink signal (RF beacon\ntracking function). The subsystems can be configured as a transponder for transfer orbit tone ranging.\nAll RF hardware is located on the despun side of the spacecraft.\nThe baseband telemetry and command (T&C) hardware consists of\nredundant despun command decoders and telemetry encoders and\nredundant spinning command decoders, telemetry encoders, and squib\nand solenoid drivers. The baseband spinning and despun units\ninterface through signal slip rings contained within the bearing\nand power transfer assembly (BAPTA).\nThe spacecraft telemetry subsystem gathers subsystem performance,\nsensor, status, and attitude information necessary for the proper\noperation of the spacecraft. The subsystem provides this\ninformation via an RF downlink during transfer orbit, drift orbit,\nand on-station operation.\nThe subsystem provides independently, on each of two telemetry\ndownlinks, three different types of data (selected by ground\ncommand): pulse code modulation (PCM) data; FM real time attitude\nsensor data; and FM real time nutation accelerometer data. Each of\nthe two data streams is independently commanded to provide the type\nof data desired; thus, it is possible to simultaneously receive FM\ndata on one channel while receiving PCM data on the other channel.\nData are gathered redundantly by two spinning and two despun\nencoders together with two telemetry subcommutators and three\nbattery cell voltage monitor units. \t\nIn the PCM node, spinning\nencoder data is routed via slip rings to the despun encoders using\na biphase modulated 8 kHz subcarrier and hyperpulse major frame\nsync. The spinning PC data are then interleaved with despun encoder\ndata, and the resultant 1 kilobit PCM biphase modulates a 32 kHz\nsubcarrier. When either FM data mode is required, the spinning\nencoder is commanded into the appropriate mode, and the despun\nencoder is commanded off. The FM data modulate a 14.5 kHz subcarrier within the spinning encoder, which is then routed through\nthe off despun encoder.\nThe telemetry/ranging switches accept the 32 or 14.5 kHz telemetry\nsubcarriers from the despun encoders and ranging tones from the Cband command receivers. The two ranging telemetry switches each\nselect either the telemetry stream from the associated encoder for\ntelemetry operations or the output of the associated receiver for\nranging operations.\t\nThe selected baseband signals are then routed\nThe\nto either pair of transmitters via the cross-strap switch. \t\nsignals are p hase modulated on the telemetry carriers at one\nradian peak deviation.\n\n12\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\n4\t\n\nThe two telemetry transmitters transmit thru the communications\nantenna via a hybrid, a harmonic filter and a directional filter;\nand thru the telemetry bicone antenna using a pair of TWTAs which\nare shared with the communications subsystem. On station, the\ntelemetry subsystem shares the communications subsystem antenna\nfeed network. The telemetry transmitter has two power output\nlevels. During transfer orbit,the lower drive level is applied to\neach of the two communications TWTAs. The tube outputs are connected to the telemetry bicone antenna. For on-station operation,\nthe higher power level is fed via a directional filter to the communications subsystem horizontal polarization, odd channel output\nmultiplexer.\nThe modulation input to the telemetry transmitter is selected by\ncommand and is either the output of the telemetry encoder or the\nranging output of the command/track receiver.\nThe telemetry bicone antenna provides a toroidal beam coverage in\ntransfer orbit with a beam width of +20 (at the 2 dB points) about\na plane perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis while the communications antenna provides area coverage on station.\nThe command signal received by the reflector antenna is separated\nfrom the communications signal by a track directional filter (TDF)\nand applied to the command/track receiver via a diplexer. The\ndiplexer consists of two bandpass filters and combining network.\nThe filters are tuned to the two command frequencies. The bicone\nis connected to the other input of the diplexer. The bicone antenna\nremains on when the spacecraft is on station for backup purposes.\nTo minimize multipath effect that would otherwise degrade antenna\npointing accuracy, the signals from the two antennas are discriminated by their frequency separation and orthogonal polarization.\nThe combined signal is filtered and fed to both of the command/track receivers.\nThe command uplinks are frequency modulated with tones in the 5 to\n15 kHz band with the format discussed below. The corresponding\npeak deviation of these tones is 173 to 75 kHz varying with frequency to compensate for the frequency compressive effects of the\ncommand/track receiver\'s frequency-locked-loop. A 100 Hz triangular waveform is also used to frequency modulate the uplink at 5\nMHz peak-to-peak deviation. This FM is used to generate AM waveforms whose amplitudes are proportional to antenna pointing error.\nThe command/track receiver locks to the 100 Hz waveform and uses\nit as a reference for detecting the east-west error signals. The\ncommand tone FM is linearly summed with this track FM waveform (but\nwith much smaller deviation), resulting in the uplink modulation.\nThe receiver simply detects th, command tones, unaffected by the\ntrack FM. As a result, both the command and track functions are\npro4ided simultaneously without degradation to either function.\n\n13\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nThe telemetry and command antennas consist of biconical horns that\nradiate 360 0 in azimuth with 20 0 (2 dB) and 35 0 (2 dB) beamwidths\n\nin elevation, respectively. Dual mode operation of the telemetry\nantenna is achieved by using a 3 dB squarax hybrid. A three-probe\npolarizing se,:tion is used to provide dual mode for the command\nantenna. Six transverse resonant dumbell slots, equally spaced\naround the circumference of a circular waveguide, transmit vertical\npolarization for the telemetry antenna. Eight longitudinal resonant slots, equally spaced around the circumference of a circular\nwaveguide, receive horizontal polarization for the command antenna.\nThe two bicone antennas are coupled to redundant transmitters and\nreceivers through flex cables that run along the omni mast down to\nthe shelf.\nThe command/track RF subsystem provides both single axis antenna\npointing control and the command uplink function. Ths bicone\nantenna provides coverage with a toroidal beam of +35 (at 2 dB\npoints) beamwidths in elevation, respectively. Dual mode operation\nof the telemetry antenna is achieved by using a 3 dB squarax hybrid.\nA three-probe polarizing section is used to provide dual mode for\nthe command antenna. Six transverse resonant dumbell slots, equally\nspaced around the circumference of a circular waveguide, transmit\nvertical polarization for the telemetry antenna. \t\nEight longitudinal\nresonant slots, equally spaced around the circumference of a circular\nwaveguide, receive horizontal polarization for the command antenna.\nThe two bicone antennas are coupled to redundant transmitters and\nreceivers through flex cables that run along the omni mast down to\nthe shelf.\nThe command/track RF subsystem provides both single axis antenna\npointing control and the command uplink function. The bicone\nantenna provides coverage with a toroidal beam of +35 0 (at 2 dB\n\npoints) beamwidth about a plane perpendicular to tl-ie spacecraft soin\naxis. The bicone is used in transfer orbit for command and ranging\nwhile the reflector antenna is used on-station for ground RF\nbeacon tracking, command, and ranging. The command spot beam is\ngenerated by sharing the use of a small segment of the communications receiver feeds.\nThe command subsystem consists of two identical, redundant, and\nsimultaneously operating channels of receiving demodulation and\ndecoding hardware that cont i nually provide complete control\ncapability over all spacecraft states and modes of operation.\nThe command receiver baseband output consists of a 25 bit command.\nThe command is composed of 0 and 1 tones in an RZ tone digital\nformat used for addressing and loading specific commands into a\nselected decoder. A third tone is used for real time execute of\nthe loaded command. Two groups of three tones are used to remove\nreceiver ambiguity; one set is associated with each receiver and\nslip ring combination.\t\nEach spacecraft has unique decoder\n\n14\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\naddresses in this format. The stored command and its execute\nstatus are telemetered every minor frame (512 ms) for ground verification. The command decoders are capable of redundantly providing 255 despun commands and 191 spinning commands. All\ncommanded automatic functions can be overridden by ground command.\nThe command subsystem is also equipped to handle baseband formats\nused for special functions. These are the axial thruster offpulsing and pseudo Earth formats.\nThe command subsystem includes a spinning squib and solenoid driver\nunit, and despun squib drivers located in the antenna positioner\nelectronics (APE). The spinning unit contains squib drivers to\ninitiate pyrotechnic devices for firing the apogee motor and for\nreleasing the despun shelf and solar panel locks. \t\nIt also contains\nvalve drivers for the axial and radial thrusters and the latch\nvalves. The despun squib drivers release the omni antenna mast and\nthe communication antenna reflector. All squib firing commands are\nprovided with separate enable commands and enable status telemetrv.\nSolenoid drivers are used to actuate isolation latch valves and the\nthruster valves in the reaction control subsystem. Each solenoid\ndriver can be actuated by either of two spinning decoders.\nThe communications transponder is a single conversion, channelized\ndesign operating in the 6/4 GHz satellite telecommunication bands.\nEach element of the transponder has associated with it a major\nsystem function and thus determines one or more of the performance\ncharateristics of the system. The transponder elements are grouped\ninto four major sections.\nThe first section of the transponder, the receiver input section,\nconsists of four receivers in a 4 to 2 redundancy switching\narrangement. The receivers are all solid state MIC designs and\noperate over the entire 500 MHz receive bandwidth. The receiver\nestablishes the system noise figure, provides approximately half\nthe total repeater gain, and downconverts the received signals to\nthe transmit frequency band. It operates in a linear mode and\nprovides constant performance over any given channel. The\nreceivers are configured to permit switching between units without communications interruption.\nThe second section consists of 4 channelizing input multiplexers\nwhich separate the receive signals into odd and even channels.\nEach multiplexer utilizes dual mode elliptic function filters in\na circulator-coupled channel dropping arrangement. The filters\nestablish three of the key channel transmission characteristics of\nthe communication subsystem: input out-of-band attenuation, gain\nslope, and group delay.\n\n15\n\n\' w\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nThe third section consists of 24 TWTAs; each TWTA has a nominal\nsaturated RF output power of 11.5 watts. The TWTA provides the\nremainder of the required channel gain and establishes the\ntransponder output power. \t\nAlthough it is a broadband device,each\nTWT is chosen for optimum performance over the channel to which it\nis assigned.\nThe fourth section consists mainly of four output multiplexers\nwhich combine the odd and even channel output signals. \t\nThe output\nmultiplexer establishes the required output out-of-band attenuation\nas well as the attenuation necessary to suppress the harmonics and\nreceive band noise generated by the TWTAs.\t\nTest couolers, which\nare provided to facilitate system test, and the output harmonic\nfilters complete the hardware complement of this section.\n\n16\n\nM-492-201-82-05\n\nPAGE 18,\t\n\nOR\t\n\nPOOR QUM=,\n\nOF\n\nLAUNCH VEHICLE DESCRIPTION\nThe Telesat-G (Anik-D1) spacecraft will be launched by the new\nthrust,-augmented NASA Delta 3920 launch vehicle (Figure 5), The\nDelta 3920 launch vehicle characteristics are shown in Table 3.
