In general, the results show increased margins for the OFT-1 indicators when compared to Mission 3A resutls. The inclusion of element and wing aerodynamic variations on OFT-1, in combination with winds and systems dispersions, resulted in the forward Z (FTO1) attach load indicator exceeding specified limits. The inboard and outboard elevon hinge moment margins (9 percent and 3 percent, respectively) on OFT-1 reflect values consistent with the load relief requirements dictated by elevon hinge moment variations. All other structural load indicators for OFT-1 had margins in excess of 10 percent. The SSV first stage stagnation heating indicators for OFT-1 were about 45 percent less than for Mission 3A. The hydraulic systems demands for both missions were essentially the same. The results also show OFT-1 performance requirements from the consideration of winds and dispersions to be approximately 3,300 lbs greater than Mission 3A.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770023219, "id": "95d6ecdd6fad4201a37b959bbf4c3521", "publicationDate": "1977-08-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770023219.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770023219/downloads/19770023219.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770023219/downloads/19770023219.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770023219/downloads/19770023219.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
