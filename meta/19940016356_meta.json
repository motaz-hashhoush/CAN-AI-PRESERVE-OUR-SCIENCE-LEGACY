The Magellan spacecraft carries a radar instrument that makes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the surface, measures the altitude of the Venusian surface directly below the spacecraft, and obtains radiometric observations of the surface. Radar and radiometric observations of the Venusian surface commenced on 15 Sep. 1990 and continued until 15 Sep. 1992. Gravity observations began on 24 Sep. 1992 and will continue until late May 1993. The radar observations produced SAR images and surface topography for 99 percent of the surface. These radar observations support the objective of improving the knowledge of the geological history of Venus by analysis of surface morphology and the processes that control them. The gravity observations that are being conducted now support the Magellan objective of improving the knowledge of the geophysics of Venus, principally its density distribution and dynamics. Also, Magellan generated more digital planetary image data than all previous planetary missions.", "title": "Magellan Mission", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940016356, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thompson, Thomas W."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "01de7dc277504256af5fa4e3c2ae9ed0"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940016356, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940016356, "id": "49f1bc4954f8492096ddb000b0bcf351", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst., Twenty-Fourth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference.
