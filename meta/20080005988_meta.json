The hold-up power supply provides the flash memory with the power needed to temporarily operate when a power loss exists. This allows the flash memory system to complete any erasures and writes, and thus allows it to shut down gracefully. The hold-up power supply detects when a power loss on a power supply bus is occurring and supplies the power needed for the flash memory system to temporally operate. The hold-up power supply stores power in at least one capacitor. During normal operation, power from a high voltage supply bus is used to charge the storage capacitors. When a power supply loss is detected, the power supply bus is disconnected from the flash memory system. A hold-up controller controls the power flow from the storage capacitors to the flash memory system. The hold-up controller uses feedback to assure that the proper voltage is provided from the storage capacitors to the flash memory system. This power supplied by the storage capacitors allows the flash memory system to complete any erasures and writes, and thus allows the flash memory system to shut down gracefully.", "title": "Hold-up power supply for flash memory", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080005988, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ott, William E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "bc551166f5b64f31ab9497375f39855c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080005988, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080005988, "id": "6f8269ab061b487b8ae1725c142f60e1", "publicationDate": "2004-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080005988.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080005988/downloads/20080005988.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080005988/downloads/20080005988.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080005988/downloads/20080005988.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
