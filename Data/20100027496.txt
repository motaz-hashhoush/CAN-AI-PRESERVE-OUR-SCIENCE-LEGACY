It offers a variety of valuable services to\nfacilitate the transfer of aerospace technology to nonaerospace applications ,\nthus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their investment in\nspace research ; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research have already\noccurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU Program has worked for engineers, scientists, technicians, and\nbusinessmen . And it can work for you.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to any U.S. citizen or organization. It is both a current-awareness medium and a problem-solving tool.\nPotential products ... industrial processes ... basic and applied research .. .\nshop and lab techniques ... computer software ... new sources of technical\ndata ... concepts . .. you will find them all in NASA Tech Briefs . The first section\nhighlights a few of the potential new products contained in Tech Briefs . The\nremainder of the volume is organized by technical category to help you quickly\nreview new developments in your areas of interest. Finally, a subject index\nmakes each issue a convenient permanent reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough many articles are complete in themselves, others are backed up by\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s) . TSP\'s are available without charge and\nmay be ordered by simply completing the enclosed TSP Request Card . Further\ninformation on some innovations is available for a nominal fee from other\nsources , as indicated at the ends of the articles.

Each is\ndiscussed further on the referenced page in the appropriate section in this issue. If\nyou are interested in developing a product from these or other NASA innovations ,\nyou can receive further technical information by requesting the TSP referenced at\nthe end of the full-length article or by writing the Technology Utilization Office of\nthe sponsoring NASA center (see page A4) . NASA\'s patent-licensing program to\nencourage commercial development is described on page A8 .\n\nPortable Solar Radiometer\n\nStack-plume effluents can be\nmeasured with a relatively-inexpensive four-channel instrument. It\nmeasures the density of particles\nand aerosols and the concentration\nof nitrous and sulfurous oxides. The\ninstrument measures the absorption\nof the Sun\'s light at four wavelengths: two in the visible region and\none each in the IR and UV regions . It\nis calibrated by measuring " unobstructed" Sunlight in the region near\na stack plume . The boresighted\ninstrument is easy to use, and tests\nof its effectiveness show agreement\nwith measurements made inside of\nmonitored smokestacks.\n(See page 548.)\n\nIronless-Armature\nBrushless Motor\nA new high-speed torque motor\nhas a low electrical time constant\nand no frictional torques . Resistance\nheating is conducted through the\nhousing rather than through the\nbearings where it could be detrimental . Possible applications include position servos and momentum wheels . The motor utilizes a\nstator containing the windings and a\nrotor comprising 12 permanent samarium cobolt magnets that provide\na high magnetic flux across the\nairgap . Hull devices are mounted\n120 degrees apart on a sensor ring\nfor commutation .\n(See page 530.)\n\nViscoelastic Foam Cushion\nA flexible urethane foam developed for aircraft seats has already\nhad a number of successful applications and has commercial potential\nin many more areas. The foam\nequally distributes applied pressure\nalong the interface , will assume the\ncontour of pressing objects , but\nreturns to its own shape when the\npressure is removed . It strongly\nattenuates vibration and impact\nenergy, being firm under impact yet\nsoft to the touch.\n(See page 582 .)\n\nA10\n\nDirect-Reading Inductance\nMeter\nThe low-inductance values typical\nof miniature coils used in breadboarding RF circuits can be measured directly, using a new TTLimplemented meter. Inductances in\nthis range are normally difficult to\nmeasure and require complex instrumentation . The meter is of\nintermediate accuracy , but is as\n\neasy to operate as a bench ohmmeter and is relatively inexpensive\nto manufacture . The circuit consists\nprimarily of a reference and a\nvariable-frequency oscillator . When\nan unknown inductance is connected in series with larger reference inductance in an LIe tuned\ncircuit, the resonant frequency of\nthe tuned circuit shifts downward.\nFor small inductances , this frequency change is nearly linear\nfunction of the unknown inductance .\n(See page 527.)\n\nIndicated Mean Effective\nPressure Instrument\nPRESSURE\nT,.,t."\'SOUCEA\n\nr-----~~==~--~\n\nReal-time measurement of the\nIMEP and mass flow within an\ninternal-combustion engine cylinder\nis possible with a new analytical\ninstrument. The instrument uses a\nsensor of the shaft angle to determine the instantaneous volume of\nthe cylinder and a conventional\ntransducer to monitor pressure .\nData from these two sources are\nprocessed electronically (using\nread-only memories) to calculate\nthe instantaneous work performed\nby the engine. Using a digital summation technique , the instantaneous\nwork is integrated to give the work\nfor an entire engine cycle . The\nneeded data are available immediately, and no post-run data reduction is necessary.\n(See page 601 .)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nForming Hard Aluminum in\nComplex Shapes\nCOflll.-ouH[).CUftVIEO ALUM IN"\'\'\'\' ~"\'At\nI"\'ITIAU Y SHAI"EO IN AN\nANHUtlED CONDITION\n\nMany of the difficulties normally\nencountered in forming complex\nshapes of aluminum in the hard , T8,\ncondition are overcome using a new\ntechnique. It could allow the use of\nhard lightweight aluminum in applications previously limited by formability restrictions . The procedure is\na straightforward extension of current formin\'g practices and requires\nno special training or equipment .\nAluminum in a soft (TO) condition is\nstretched and marked with gridlines,\nIt is then solution treated, refrigerated , and stretched . The controlled\nstretching induces an intermediate\ntemper that allows the metal part to\nbe brought to the T8 condition, using\nstandard techniques .\n(See page 635 .)\n\nAluminum Transfer Method\nfor Plating Plastics\nA very hard and smooth film of\nmetal can be bonded to plastics,\nusing a new electroless plating technique , It can be used to plate plastic\nparts that are formed in molds .\nWhen the part is cast, a film of\naluminum powder is placed inside\nthe mold; an electroless procedure\nis used to plate another metal , such\nas nickel, onto the plastic. No\nspecial surface preparation is required ; the plate is very smooth and\nfollows the surface detail of the part\nexactly. The process has been\nuseful with cast epoxy resins and\ncould possibly be adapted to other\nproduction methods , such as blow\nmolding and injection molding ,\n(See page 646.)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\nCatalysts for Low-Energy\nAldehyde Processes\nA catalyst for the " oxo" process\n(hydroformulation) , used in industry\nto produce aldehydes , allows the\nprocess to be carried out under conditions much milder than those currently used . If proved effective on a\nlarge scale , this new catalyst could\ncontribute substantial savings in\nboth energy and dollars. The catalyst is a transition metal complex ,\nsuch as dicobalt octacarbonyl ,\nbonded to a polymer such as poly\n4-vinyl pyridine via ultraviolet light.\nWith the catalyst , hydroformulation\ncan be carried out at ambient\nconditions . In addition to producing\naldehydes as end products , the\nprocess could also be useful in the\nformation of intermediates for the\nliquefaction of coal.\n(See page 576.)\n\nbility to old or faded documents. The\nsystem not only improves contrasts\nbut also reduces the relative intensity of " noise" (unwanted black dots ,\nstains , and so forth) . Broken lines\nare restored by digital-logic techniques , and the edges of letters are\nsharpened by using high-pass digital\nfilters . The system includes an\nelectro-optic scanner , a video tape\nand TV screen, and a microprocessor unit that controls the logic\ncircuitry. The enhanced document\ncan be displayed on the TV screen\nand reproduced as hard copy or\nmicrofilm. The potential applications\nmarket in the United States alone is\nestimated at about 50 million pages\nof documents in archives , libraries ,\nmuseums , and law enforcement\nagencies .\n(See page 651 .)\n\nTransducer Bonding Kit\n\nMultiple-Bubble Detector\nA new multiple-bubble detector\nuses a pair of passive replicators in\nconjunction with chevron-stretcher\ndetectors. The addition of the\npassive replicators eliminates problems with stripout that can otherwise\noccur in the start/stop mode. This\ndevice allows outputs to be increased to around 10 mV. The use of\ntwo replicators allows two stretchers\nto be used, thus halving the number\nof elements needed and similarly\nreducing the time needed for\nstretchout. The output can be further\nincreased by adding even more\nreplicator and detector sections.\n(See page 493 .)\nPASSIVE\nA\xc2\xa3P\\.ICArOAS\n\nDocument Restoration by\nComputer Techniques\nA computerized unit combines\noptical image enhancement and\ndigital data analysis to restore legi-\n\n5::z ..,. ".,. ~\n\n~\'.\n\n,,\' "t".\'.-.\'.\n\nA relatively inexpensive kit can\nsave time in affixing transducers to\nsurfaces too large or convoluted to\nallow the use of C-clamps or\nweights. It was developed to bond\nsmall rectangular strain gages to\naluminum or titanium surfaces ,\nusing epoxy resins , but could be\nused with other parts and surface\ntypes . The loading pressure can be\nset precisely and monitored during\ncuring . Nevertheless, the kit is easy\nto set up and use. Adapters allow\nbonding in limited-access areas ,\nand the kit itself can be used on the\nunderside of large planar surfaces .\nA vacuum-hold system attaches the\nkit to the surface, and an adjustablespring clamp is used to set the\npressure .\n(See page 641.)\n\nA11\n\nDifferential-Optoacoustic\nAbsorption Detector\n\nFast Measurement of\nBacterial Susceptibility to\nAntibiotics\n\nOASFII.L LINE\n\nApplications ranging from airborne pollution detection to chemical analysis could make use of a\nnew system for measuring laserexcited components in gaseous\nmixtures . It consists of a laser, an\noptical chopper, a novel double-cell\ngas compartment, and detector\ncircuitry. Devices of this type are\noften referred to as spectrophones ,\nbecause they use a capacitance\nmicrophone to measure pressure\nchanges caused by optical absor~\ntion in a gas . The double cell in this\ndevice allows the measurement of\ndifferential rather than absolute\npressures and thus offers a sensitivity nearly 100 times better than for a\nconventional spectrophone .\n(See page 552 .)\n\nA method has been devised for\nfast measurement of the sensitivity\nof bacteria in body fluids to a variety\nof antimicrobial agents . A luciferase/luciferin assay for ATP is the\nbasis for this technique, which\nreduces the 2- or 3-day delay\nnormally associated with this type of\nanalysis to less than a working day.\nThe technique can be used to\ndetermine the presence of infection\nas well as the susceptibilities to\nseveral antibiotics. The method itself\ncould be incorporated into a marketable system that would have technical capabilities and speed superior\nto currently available technology. A\nsimpler version could be used as an\nATP screening version that could,\nfor instance , reduce the culturing\nrequirements in hospital urinalysis\nby as much as 50 percent . In the\nprocess , nonbacterial ATP is removed to determine the presence of\ninfection; if infection is present, the\nsample is treated with antibodies ,\nincubated , and tested for ATP. The\ngains in time result from the speed\nof the luciferase/luciferin technique\nand the fact that each bacterial\nstrain need not be isolated and\ncultured separately .\n(See page 592.)\n\nImage Intensification of\nDeveloped Photographs\nUnderexposed or other poorquality developed film can be enhanced quickly and inexpensively by\nusing a new autoradiography technique . Formerly, use of this technique was limited because of problems with effectiveness, safety, and\ncost . Basically , the technique consists of treating the developed film\nwith a chemical that contains a\nbeta-emitting radioisotope. The iscr\ntope attaches to the exposed silver\non the film; then the treated betaemitting film is used to expose a new\nnegative. By replacing the usual\nradioisotope solution with an organic\nsulfur compound, (e.g ., a thiourea)\ncontaining S-35, virtually all the disadvantages previously associated\nwith autoradiography can be eliminated. ProceSSing is simplified and\nspeeded up, radiation hazards are\nreduced, and the original film is not\ndegraded.\n(See page 553 .)\n\nPATENT LICENSES RECENTLY GRANTED BY NASA FOR COMMERCIAL USE OF NASA-OWNED INVENTIONS\nThe patent licenses listed below have been recently awarded by NASA as part of its program to encourage the\ncommercial application of its new technology.

The technique was developed for an optical\nstar tracker that uses chargecoupled devices (ceo\'s) as sensors, and accuracy was increased\nfrom one part in a hundred to the\norder of one part in a thousand . The\nsame approach could be adapted to\nother optical sensing requirements\n(e.g., Sun sensors) or nonoptical\nsensing when the sensed events are\nsufficiently numerous to be characterized statistically (e .g., electrons\nor X-rays) .\nThe scheme is a hard-wired\nalgorithm that is kept relatively\nsimple and easy to implement by\ncontrolling the input optics to the\narray of ceo \'s. The distribution and\ninput of a point source sensed by the\narray is characterized by a pointspread function as shown in Figure\n\n1a. The shape of this function\ndepends on the lenses and optics\nused .\nAn algorithm circuit compares\ncharge levels in adjacent chargecoupled elements to determine the\ncentroid of the optical input. However, the array, being a discreteelement device , senses the point\nspread as a discontinuous function ,\nintegrated over discrete intervals\n(Figure 1b).\nThe centroid of the image pointspread function (and thus the position of the source) is determined\nfrom its line-spread function (Figure\n1c) . The point-spread function is\nassumed to be symmetrical , and the\nprocedure is analogous to finding\nthe centroid of a solid of revolution :\nthe integral of the moment (Le . , of\nthe line-spread function) is divided\nby the integral of the density function\n(Le., total flux density) . For the\ndiscrete case, the centroid is determined by the sum of the individual\nmoments divided by the flux for all\nintervals.\n\nThe solution is not straightforward , however, because although\nthe interval sizes are known (the size\nof the ceO), their position relative to\nthe centroid is not known . This\nmeans that in integrating over the\nintervals in Figure 1c , say along the\nX axis, the value of Xc is not known.\n(The position of the centroid, I, is of\ncourse known within an error of D.x,\na CCO element dimension , but the\npoint of the algorithm is to achieve\nbetter resolution.) This problem is\nsolved without using complex and\nexpensive circuitry by requiring that\nthe actual line-spread function be\nnearly linear from edge to edge , or\nin other words, performing a linear\ninterpolation .\nIn practice, there is considerable\ntolerance in how close to linear the\nline-spread function must be. A\ncatadioptric system, in which the\ncenter part of the lens is occluded ,\nhas been found to work well.

In one such\npickup scheme a proportionalcounter (PC) tube is used to convert\nX-ray events to analog Signals,\nwhich are amplified in a GSA before\nbeing processed further in a digital\ncircuit for subsequent event\ncounting and storage. However, the\neffects of noise, pulse pileup, and dc\ninstability (experienced in prior\nGSA\'s) tend to deteriorate amplifier\noutput signal quality.\n\n488\n\nA circuit for a small economical\ncharge-sensitive amplifier is illustrated. It features a Blankenshiptype filter with a frequency response\ncentered at 160 kHz. Although four\ntubes are used, each of which is\ncoupled to a separate GSA, only one\nis shown .\nThe PC is series coupled via the\ntube high-voltage power supply to\nintroduce a positive charge impulse\nto the GSA. The amplifier converts\nthe charge impulse to a voltage\nmode step with a 50-~s decay time .\nSince the signal is sufficiently above\nnoise level, the GSA outputs are\nmultiplexed for economy. The mUlti-\n\nplexer output signal is amplified and\npassed through a band-pass filter\nwhich further attenuates highfrequency noise and low-frequency\nnoise. The band-pass null frequency, 325 kHz, is the operating frequency of the PC supply and serves\nto attenuate this noise source by an\nadditional 30 dB.\nThe output of the filter is a bipolar\npulse with a maximum peak amplitude of 5 V. This is applied to the\nnegative inputs of two high-speed\ncomparators. The comparators\nchange output states only if the\npulse applied to the negative inputs\nexceeds the dc bias voltages refer-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter1976\n\nr-- - - - I\nI\n\n+\n\n-~N;;W-- - - - - ,\n\nI\n\nDISCRIMINATOR\n\nI\n\nANTICOINCIDENCE\nCIRCUIT\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n__ -.J\n\nL __\nWINDOW\nLOWER\nEDGE\n\nWINDOW\nUPPER\nEDGE\n\nDAC\n\nenced to the positive inputs .

It\nshould result in increased replicator\nmargins approaching those of other\nportions of the device .\nThis repl icator design provides a\nreplicate function between the\ndevice storage area and the guardrail detector in order that nondestructive read-out of the memory\ncan be achieved. The use of guardrail detectors in magnetic domain\n(bubble) circuits is a proposed\nmethod of increasing detector signal\noutput by increasing detector size\nwithout dedicating an excessive\namount of device chip area to the\ndetector portion . Bubbles sensed in\na guardrail detector are dumped into\na safe area outside the device region\nand do not return to the storage\narea . While both active (requiring\ncurrent command pulses for operation) and passive (automatically\nreplicating any bubble which passes\nthrough the replicator) replicators\nwill provide this replicate function ,\npassive replicators are desirable\nwhen all bubbles passing through\nare to be detected , since power\nconsumption and number of control\nleads are both reduced .\nAs seen in the illustration, a\nbubble from the main storage area\nof the device is propagated along\nchevron path A. When it reaches\nposition C, it is elongated into a\nlarge strip that simultaneously exists\nin the lower chevron path A to Band\nthe upper chevron path D. This is\naccomplished by the presence of\nlike magnetic poles in both\nPermalloy chevron tracks (for a\nbubble at position C) due to the\ninteraction of the Permalloy chevron\nelements with the in-plane rotating\nmagnetic field used for domain\npropagation . The Permalloy bar (E)\naids in bubble strip-out into the top\ntrack.

The magnetic poles\ngenerated at the ends of these bars\nrepel the elongated strip , forcing it\nto assume the position depicted in\nthe illustration. Whenever the elongated domain is in the depicted\nposition , the repelling (collapsing)\nmagnetic poles generated by the\nrotating field at the bottom ends of\nbars E and F cause the elongated\nstrip to break in the region between\nthe two tracks . Once broken, the\ntwo halves become separate bubble\nstrips . One propagates along Band\nreturns the initial data to the storage\narea , and the other propagates\n\nalong 0 to the guardrail detector.\nWhile replication for detection\nwas used to simplify the operation\ndescription, replicators can be\nemployed to provide data for other\nuses. Also, the exact lengths and\nplacements of Permalloy elements E\nand F and the top chevron element\nin A to B in the area where the two\ntracks overlap are not necessarily\nthose which will be ultimately\nemployed in the finalized device.\nOptimization for best operation will\ndetermine these.\nThis work was done by Thomas R.\nOettinger and Leonard R.

It is an alternative to existing passive replicators ,\nwhich have good margins but\nrequire that the Permalloy-to-garnet\nspacing be smaller than desirable\nfor low-drive field operation. The\nnew replicator uses long bars\ninstead of chevrons to do the\nstretching . The bars are arranged so\nthat at high bias the failure to expand\ninto a strip does not cause hard\nerrors (i. e., the bubble will continue\nto propagate although it does not\nreplicate) .\nThe arrangement in Figure 1 is\nparticularly attractive as the bars\nmay be made quite long. resulting in\na deep potential well at one end\nwhich has a considerable stripping\neffect even at high bias . When the\nbubble does not elongate , it simply\ncontinues propagating in the\nmain chevron track whether the\nPermalloy spacing is large or small.\nMeasurements on a 16-lAm per\nperiod device, of the design shown\nin Figure 1, indicate a bar-to-garnet\nspacing of 0 .58 lAm and a margin of\n12-t0-14 Oe at 50 Oe . The existing\nreplicator design has less than half\nof this margin. About 2 to 4 Oe are\nlost at the low-bias end due to stripping of the bubble from the first\nchevron back to the parallel bars for\nthe field orientation Hstripout as\nindicated .\nStroboscopic measurements\nrevealed that the situation shown in\nFigure 2 occurs at low-bias fields\nand results in a splitoff bubble which\neventually runs down the bar to the\nother end and pops off . There are\nseveral alternatives to prevent this ,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\nand the simplest is to add one or\nmore additional bars as shown in\nFigure 3. In this methods, the repulsive poles closest to the chevrons\nserve to repel the bubble and prevent stripout. Another alternative is\nto rotate the end bar as in Figure 4 to\nretard stripout as low bias .\nAt low bias and small spacings ,\none other observed failure mode\nproduces stray bubbles . This is\ncaused by cutting , due to the bars\nadjacent to the cutter element. It is\nbelieved to be a result of the large\nseparation between chevron tracks\nwhich can be eliminated by moving\nthe tracks closer together. Another\nalternative is to shorten the bars as\nindicated in Figure 5.\nPROPAGAnON DlREcnON\n\nlllllMM\n~~W\n\n,~~\nADDED{~\nBARS\n\n~\n\nFigure 3.

It uses only unipolar control\npulses , which simplifies the matrixing electronics when used in a large\nmultiple-chip system . The detectors\nare removed from the track and can\nbe arranged independently without\naffecting the storage loop. Furthermore , the device can be operated in\nalternative-bit mode which provides\nhigher detector output and less\nbubble interaction.\nIn the present single-loop organization, there are three control functions on a chip (generation, annihilation , and detection) . With the detection circuit in the storage loop,\nthere is a finite separation between\nthe detector and annihilator positions. The generator is located in a\nseparate branch and can be placed\nat the same position as the annihilator, which causes a gap in the\nmemory loop and requires a chipaline mode in a multiple-chip\nsystem . If the generator is alined\nwith the detector to eliminate the\ngap in the memory loop, there is a\ndelay between generation and\nannihilation functions which requires\nadditional electronics to keep track\nof the status and operating mode of\nthe chip.\nAn ideal situation would be to pull\nthe detector out of the track and\naline it with the generator and\nannihilator simultaneously,\neliminating both the data gap in the\nstorage loop and the time delay\nbetween the generator and annihilator. This can be achieved by replicating any incoming bubble into two\nseparate bubbles to maintain nondestructive readout . The existing\nactive replicator requires a bipolar\ncontrol pulse which complicates the\ndriver network.

Computer Analysis of the Switch gives a theoretical isolation\nof 100 dB, with diode forward resistance set to 1 ohm. The diode\nfunction capacitance and bond-wire inductance is indicated for\ncommercially-available Schottky diodes.\n\nMicrostrip switch designs are\nhobbled by the inability to achieve\nhigh isolation and by the inability to\nmaintain a broadband match in all\nswitch positions . High isolation requires the use of several conventional diodes, all electrically\nmatched and mounted in a shunt or\nseries configuration along the transmission line . As the diodes are\nadded to the line, however, input-tooutput impedance matching\nbecomes progressively difficult to\nachieve.\nA new ring diplexer switch\nachieves high isolation and continuous input/output matching by using\nthe resonant coupling structure of\nthe diplexer. Additionally, the dc\nbias network used to control the\nswitch is decoupled from the RF\ninput and output lines. Voltage\ntransients in external circuits are\nthus minimized .\nThe switch uses four microwave\ndiodes (such as gallium arsenide\nSchottky-barrier types) that are configured shunt-to-ground at the four\ncorners of the diplexer ring as illustrated in Figure 1 . The ring diodes\nare dc biased via a quarter-wavelength line bypassed to RF ground at\nthe ring resonant frequency . When\nthe switch diodes are unpowered,\nthey appear to switch elements as\nhigh impedances to RF ground . The\nswitch therefore attenuates the\nmicrowave signal at its operating\nfrequency which is centered at 4.9\nGHz. At this frequency, insertion\nloss is approximately 58.5 dB .\nWhen a positive bias voltage is\napplied to the diodes, the effective\ndiode impedances are lowered, thus\nshorting both ends of the quarterwavelength coupling sections of the\nswitch input arms to ground. This\ndecouples the ring from the input\nand output circuits, passing most of\nthe input energy to the output circuit. Input-to-output insertion loss\nthen is 1.5 dB.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new digital voltage-controlled\noscillator (VeO) provides a relatively\nsimple means of extracting Doppler\ninformation from modulated RF\nsignals . As designed, it may be\nuseful for data communications\nsystems, or it may be modified to\nserve as the information extraction\ncomponent of a microwave or optical system for collision avoidance or\nautomatic braking.\nSeveral methods are known for\nthe extraction of Doppler information\nfrom an RF signal , one of the better\nbeing the vernier technique ; but\neven with this approach there are\nconstraints . For example, the delay\ntime between a count command and\nits execution is dependent on the\ndesired resolution and the Doppler\nfrequency. In applications where\ndelay time is of little importance, the\nvernier technique can provide a\nresolution which is comparable to\nthe limitations imposed by the best\noscillator. However, when a rapid\nresponse is sought , the resolution\nmay have to be degraded intentionally.\nWhen the delay time is important\nand precision is required, a new\ntechnique can be used. The basic\nconcept employs a digitally controlled oscillator in a phase-locked\nloop, which acquires, tracks , and\nmeasures the Doppler frequency.\nThe nominal value of the incoming\nfrequency is represented by a digital\nnumber, which in turn controls the\nreference-frequency synthesizer. At\nphase lock, the incoming frequency\nand the generated frequency are\nidentical, since only a small phase\nerror will exist. The precision of the\nfrequency measurement is unlimited, since it merely requires a few\nmore bits in the control registers to\nsplit one cycle of Doppler to an even\nsmaller fraction . For example , a\n20-bit register could provide a resolution of one-millionth of a Doppler\ncycle .\n\n502\n\nDVCO\n\n,--I\nCLOCK\nFREQUENCY\n(Fo)\n\nI\n1I\n1\n\nL\n\nARITHMETIC\nPROCESS\n\n~\nNR\n\nFREQUENCY\nREGISTER\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nDESIRED\nFREQUENCY\nFs - F(FO , NR)\n\n1\n\nI\n\n- - ~\nFREQUENCY\nSELECTION\n(NR)\n\nFigure 1. A Typical Digital veo as used in the Doppler extraction\ntechnique has no band-limiting devices. Therefore, the output frequency\nis changed almost immediately after the register number is changed.\nThe digital VCO is a frequencysynthesizing device with an output\nfrequency specified precisely by a\ndigital number programed into a\nregister (frequency register). By\nchanging the number in the register,\nthe output frequency is changed\nproportionately. There are several\nmethods of implementing a DVCO,\nbut in general, all of the techniques\nconvert a stable known reference\nfrequency (clock frequency) to the\ndesired output frequency by arithmetic operations on the digital frequency register number and/or the\nclock frequency. Figure 1 is a functional diagram of a typical digitally\ncontrolled oscillator.\nTo extract Doppler information\nfrom a Doppler reference signal , the\ndigital VCO can be phase locked to\nthe Doppler reference in such a way\nthat the feedback error signal controls the frequency register number\nand maintains phase lock. This is\nshown in the block diagram of Figure\n\n2. By monitoring the register\nnumber, the Doppler reference frequency (and hence the Doppler\nfrequency) can be determined. By\ncontinuous monitoring of the register\nnumber, the time history of the\nDoppler frequency can be\ndetermined.\nThe rate at which the frequency\nregister is updated is governed by\nthe bandwidth of the low-pass loop\nfilter . Wide bandwidths allow rapid\nupdates and low phase error\nbetween the register number and the\nDoppler reference frequency . However, they also admit more noise.\nAcquisition of the Doppler reference by the DVCO can be accomplished simply by presetting the\ndesired number in the frequency\nregister. If the Doppler reference is\nknown to within the loop bandwidth,\nacquisition should occur almost\nimmediately. A sweep acquisition\ncan be implemented by periodically\nincreasing (or decreasing) the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1976\n\nLOW-PASS\nFILTER\n\nDOPPLER\nREFERENCE - - "\n\nDVCO\n\nADC\n\nUP\n\nDOWN\n\n.............- ........\n"\'"----t---t A RIT H M ETI C\nPROCESS\n\nFREQUENCY\nREGISTER\n\nL\n\nI\nI\n\n-~\n\nCLOCK-REFERENCE\nFREQUENCY\n\nDOPPLER\nOUTPUT\n\nFigure 2. When the DVCO Is Used as a Doppler Extractor, the phasedetector output error signal is low-pass filtered and fed to an analog-todigital converter. The numerical output of the ADC is used to change the\nfrequency register so that the DVCO output frequency remains in phase\nlock to the Doppler reference signal. At phase lock, the DVCO frequency\nand the Doppler reference frequency are equal. Thus, the digital number\nin the frequency register is proportional (or functionally related) to the\nDoppler reference signal.\nregister number by a constant increment. The DVCO frequency will then\nbe stepped in precise frequency\nincrements. When acquisition\noccurs, the register-incrementing\ndevice can be removed .\n\nThe accuracy of the Doppler\nmeasurement depends on the usual\nexternal parameters . In a one-way\nDoppler measurement, the\naccuracy and stability of the frequency standard is the most serious\n\nlimitation . In two-way Doppler\nsystems with a common transmitand-receive oscillator, this is a\nmuch less serious problem. The\nsignal-ta-noise ratio at the receiver\noutput also affects the Doppler\naccuracy.\nIn general , when the receiver is\nused for voice or data communication , the received power is more\nthan adequate to obtain a high\nsignal-ta-noise ratio on the Dopplershifted carrier component. Residual\ncarrier systems provide this carrier\ncomponent directly, while the newer\nsuppressed-carrier modulation techniques provide strong reconstructed\ncarrier components to allow errorfree data demodulation . A carrier\nsignal-ta-noise ratio of 24 dB or\nbetter is sufficient to achieve a\n0.01-Hz Doppler accuracy in a\n1-second period . The signal-ta-noise\nratio can be controlled by making\nthe loop bandwidth relatively\nnarrow.\n\nThis work was done by Eugene R.\nStarner and Edward J.

The\nsmoothed range word is based on\nthe most recent range word and the\n15 previous range words.\nThe second filter smooths over 2,\n4, 8, and 16 range words, with\nsample-rate options of 2, 4, 8, and\n16 samples/second for any of the\nallowed number of range words. It\ncan be also programed to perform\nother functions. Both filters update\nthe smoothed range word to correct\nfor the time lag resulting when\naveraging over N words.\nThe principal components of the\ncascaded-averaging filter (Figure 1)\nare input/output registers, a 32word memory, and an arithmeticlogic unit (ALU) . Read-only\nmemories containing a programed\nalgorithm direct the various data\nunits which are connected by a data\nbus .\nThe contents of the memory are\nscanned beginning with word 1, the\nmost recent data word . This word,\nalong with the previous 5 data\nwords, is summed by the ALU which\nfunctions as an accumulator. Words\n7 through 12 are read out of memory\nbut are not added by the accumulator. Beginning with word 13, the next\n6 words are read out of memory and\nare sequentially subtracted from the\naccumulated sum which represents\nthe first 6 words . If subtraction\n\n504\n\nthrough zero occurs, the algorithmic\ncomplement is used .\nAfter the weighting function is\nentered, the computed range rate is\nstored in the output range-rate\nregister and in a scratch pad\nmemory for later use in updating the\nsmoothed range word .

The\nsmoothed word is delayed by 8\nsample times from the incoming\ndata word . A correction factor equal\nto half the range rate is added or\nsubtracted from the smoothed word \'\nto update the computed range word,\nwhich is accomplished by retrieving\nthe range-rate word from the\nscratch pad memory and either\nadding or subtracting.\nThe programable filter (Figure 2)\nincludes input/output registers, two\n32-word memories, and two arithmetic units. The memories are segmented into two blocks of 16 words\neach and are identical except that\none memory board has pullup\nresistors for the data bus . The\nmemory labeled "Data and Error"\nstores incoming data words in one\nblock of 16 words; error words are\nstored in the second block which , in\naddition , is used to store computed\n\nrange words and is the unit which\nmakes it possible to implement the\nN-parallel filter concept.\nArithmetic-logic unit 1 is utilized\nfor addition , subtraction, and division. When computing error words ,\nthe results are stored in the error\nmemory as a 15-bit error word. Bit\n16 is the word sign. For negative\nwords the word is automatically\ncomplemented so that the magnitude plus sign is stored . When other\nadd or subtract operations are performed , all 16 bits are used as data.\nArithmetic-logic unit 2 operates\nas an accumulator to compute the\nerror word. The filter scans the error\nmemory twice: On the first scan,\nALU 2 sums up all of the positive\nwords ; on the second pass the negative words are sequentially subtracted from the accumulated sum.\nIf subtraction through zero occurs,\nthe contents of the accumulator are\ncomplemented, and the remaining\nnegative words are added to the\ncomplemented word .\nThis work was done by Harold B.\nKillen and Walter B.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nIn data-transmission systems,\nreceivers must accept a wide range\nof input-signal levels and have errorfree threshold detection. Threshold\ndetection levels must be set low\nenough to recover low-level data.\nHowever, high-level data can drive\nthe receiver stages nonlinear (into\nsaturation and cutoff) and cause\nvoltage offsets at the output in\nexcess of established detection\nlevels. To prevent these problems\nwith high-level data, a clipper stage\ncan be added at the system input to\nkeep signal levels within the linear\noperating range of the receiver.\nAlthough the clipper stage\npresents high-level signal distortion it can result in asymmetrical\npositive and negative threshold\nlevels, which degrades signal detection . This is caused by the bias voltage on the receiver input transistor\nstage and by the asymmetrical\noperation of the transistors and\ndiodes in the clipper itself.\nTo deal with these problems a\ncapacitively-coupled clipper stage\ncan be employed (see figure) . There\nis dc isolation from the bias -V 1 of\nthe input, and therefore there is no\noffset of clipping levels . The input is\nclipped at +E and -E and applied to\nthe receiver input. Due to its\nsymmetry about the bias -V 1, there\nis no unbalance in the input wave-\n\nElimination of Thermally\nGenerated EMF\'s on PC Boards\nOften , PC boards have contacts\nmade of dissimilar metals that\nproduce unwanted thermally generated signals .

The best\nmethod consists of covering the\nsurface of the material with a highly\ndoped semiconductor. In the case of\np-type materials, the usual method\nis to use a Ga solution doped with Ge\nor Zn. However, it is difficult to\nobtain highly doped layers at growth\ntemperatures much below about\n75CJ> C. Also, if Zn is used, it is\nimportant to keep the Zn concentration in the solution to a minimum in\norder to prevent cross-contamination of the other layers in the typical\nmultiple-bin boat.\nIf a Sn solution is used instead of\none of Ga, it is possible to obtain\ngood GaAs growth at low temperatures . The layers are highly p-type,\nand less Zn is needed than with a Ga\nsolution. The procedure can be used\nto form a topmost layer for heterojunction laser diodes on which\nexcellent ohmic contacts can be\nformed. A further advantage to using\nSn is that the lattice parameter is\nexpanded, resulting in a better\nlattice parameter match to\n(AIGa)As . The result is less strain in\nthe structure.\nAn example of this method is the\nformation of the ohmic contact on a\nsemiconductor laser, as shown in\nthe figure, with one surface composed of p-type conductivity\nmaterial . The p material has a wide\nenergy band gap and a large crystal\nlattice. To the surface of the semiconductor device, a degenerate\nregion of semiconductor material is\napplied .

The\ndegenerate region with high conductivity and a narrow band gap provides a surface to which a good\nmetal-to-semiconductor contact can\nbe made.

The\nword " active " means that transmitted power is generated by sources\nassociated with the antenna rather\nthan by the reflection of an incident\nsignal , as in a passive retrodirective\nantenna. This array is also known as\na self-focusing array.\nAll self-phasing transmitting arrays are based on the phase configuration principle ; i.e., each element\nof the array is connectf\'d to a circuit\nwhich transforms the r3ce ived\nphase , wt - (Jr , into transmitted\nphase , wt + (Jr (w is 2n times the\n\nfrequency of the incoming "pilot"\nsignal, r is the distance from the\npilot source to the element , and ~ =\nw/v , where v is the phase velocity in\nthe intervening medium). Since + (Jr\nis the phase of a wave traveling\ntoward r =0, the envelope of all the\nspherical waves radiated by each\nelement is just the incident wave\nfront reversed in direction .\nThe phase conjugation circuits of\nexisting ARA\'s are located at , or\nvery close to , their associated array\nelements . Each phase conjugation\ncircuit requires a phase reference\nwhich must be uniform (i.e ., a fixed\nphase modulo 2n) throughout the\narray . This phase reference is pro-\n\nvided by the pilot Signal received by\none of the elements of the array and\nis distributed to each of the phase\nconjugation circuits associated with\nother elements of the array through\ntransmission lines of fixed electrical\nlength. In order to assure the stability of this phase reference distribution system, the array must be rigid ,\nand therefore (for a given structural\nmaterial) relatively heavy.\nThe new ARA overcomes this\ndifficulty by employing a chain topology for the array. In the topology the\nphase conjugation circuit for the nth\nelement is located at or near the\n(n-1 )th element (the O-th element is\nthe reference element) , and the\n\n,---------------,\nMI\n\nI\n\nM2\n\n(5)\n\n( 7)\n\n(9)\n\n.-.t--~\n\nTO AND FROM\nEL EM ENT\nA T \'2. elc.\n\n(8 )\n\nPHASE CON JUGATI ON ASSEMBLY\nPILOT SIGNALS\n\nW- 20(l1" 2) LEGEND:\nEP CM - Elemental Phase Con jugation Module\nM / W FE - M icrowave Front End\nIF DPX - IF Dlple.e,\nxN PLL - Phase\xc2\xb7 locked M I W source; 2,,13 - Nw\nUS B F - Uppe, Sideband Fille,\nLS B F - Lowe, Sideband Fille \'\n\n\'I\n\n\'\\\n\nSIGNAL PHASE TABLE POINTS :\n\n~\\\n\n(1 ) w I \xc2\xb7 P\'O\n(2) wI \' P\'I\n(3) wi , P\' I \xe2\x80\xa2 "" 0\n\n\'3\nRETRODIRE CTED SIGNAL\n\n(4) 2wl + 2P\'I + 2"" 0 \' 4P,O\n2wl + 2P\' I . 4P,O\n(6 ) w I + 0\'2 + "\'21 \xe2\x80\xa2 2P\'I\n(7) 3wI + P\'2 + "\' 21 . 4P\'O\n(8 ) w I \xe2\x80\xa2 P\'2 \xe2\x80\xa2 "\'21\n(9 ) 2wl + 2P\'2 + 2"\'2 1 . 4P,O\n(5)\n\nFigure 1 .

The phase circuit also functions as a frequency\ndiscriminator to aid in acquiring phase lock.\nphase circuit in reference (originally\nsupplied by the reference element)\nis regenerated at each successive\nphase conjugation circuit in a\nmanner which does not depend on\nthe phase delay of the transmission\nline connecting successive\nelements .\nThe operation of the ARA system is\nshown in Figure 1. Two pilot signals\nhave frequencies f 1 and f 2such that\nf 1 - f 2 = 50 MHz. They are mixed in\nthe microwave front end to produce\nthe incoming IF (intermediate frequency) w = 2n (f 1- f ~ .

The in,\ncoming IF phase is therefore wt ~r I , where ~ = ~1 - ~2 (point 2 in the\nillustration) . This signal is transmitted to the reference element\nwhich is at distance r 0 from the pilot\nsource . At this point (3) the IF phase\nat time t is retarded by the phase\ndelay, -4> 10 , of the transmission line\nbetween the elements at r 0 and r l \'\nThis phase is conjugated and\ndoubled in the elemental phase con-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs.

The transmitted I F phase\n(point 5) is, therefore , correctly\nconjugated. This I F then serves as\nthe reference for a phase-locked xN\nmultiplier which provides an X-band\ndownlink.

The antenna\noperates over the 8- to 50-GHz\nband . The inherent bandwidth for the\nconventional CCH antenna is\n1.75 :1. In the updated design, bandwidth is increased to 3: 1. The range\nis extended by utilizing harmonic\nbands of operation, and side ports\nare added to launch widely spaced\nfrequencies .\nE-plane and H-plane radiation\npatterns vary only a few percent\nover the 8.2- to 26-GHz frequency\nband. A harmonic band of operation\nis located around 40 GHz. When the\nCCH is used with a collimating dielectric lens, efficient focusing of the\nfar-field E-plane and H-plane patterns is obtained for all frequencies\nin the fundamental band with fixed\nhorn and lens spacing . The phase\ncenter of the horn is independent of\nfrequency and polarization .\nIn one application the CCH\nantenna is used with a five-channel,\ndual-polarized radiometer in which\nthe desired channels range over a\n5.6: 1 frequency band . Radiometer\nsystelTls requi re antennas with\nextremely-low side lobes and insertion loss. This radiometer system\nfeed requi red 10 ports (both polarizations at 6.6, 10.7, 18, 21 , and 37\nGHz) , with each port sourcing\nnearly-equal E-plane and H-plane\nwidths for efficient aperture illumination . Feed spillover past the reflector had to be only a few percent\nof its radiated power, with nearlycoincident , well-defined phase\ncenters for all ports and low insertion loss .\n\n516\n\nSIDE APERTURE\n\nVERTEX\nINPUT\n\n\\\n\nRING-LOADED\nCORRUGATION REGION\n\nThe Corrugated, Conical Hom [CCH] antenna is shown above. The ringloaded CCH can be fed through the vertex of the cone with wideband\nwaveguides, such as double-ridged rectangular or quad-ridged circular,\nor simply ring-loaded, corrugated waveguides. This is best for extremely\nwide bands. The antenna is also fed through coupling apertures (or\nprobes) in the side of the cone at appropriate diameters. This is for\nnarrow frequency bands, but multiple elements can be used for\nfrequency bands with wide separations.\nIn the CCH antenna the frequencies are periodic at which the\nsurface impedance produced by the\ncorrugations is capacitive; harmonic\nbands of fast-wave performance\nexist. Actual pattern performance is\nlimited by factors such as: (1) corrugation spacing which should be less\nthan (or at least not equal to) )"/2, to\nmaintain good impedance match\n\nand to avoid higher-order-mode\nexcitation, and (2) the ability to\nlaunch only the fundamental hybrid\nmode with a good impedance\nmatch .\nThis work was done by Kenneth A.\n\nGreen of Microwave Research Corp.\nfor Caltech/JPL.

To detect\nthe correct sequence, two hex\ninverter sets are placed in the output\nof the shift-register stages (in a " 0"\nstate when the pseudonoise word is\nreceived correctly) such that all\n" 1" s are input to the two multiplexers when there is a unity correlation coefficient . An address\ncounter (in the data selector-multiplexer), clocked by lines A, S, and C\nat a frequency higher (X8) than the\nPN shift clock, multiplexes the W\noutput signals to enable the inputs of\na pai r of counters (clocked at the\nsame rates A, S, and C as the multi-\n\nplexers). This accumulates counts\nproportional to the number of "1 " s\noutput from the shift registers over a\nPN clock period. The counters ,\noutput 4-bit words to an arithmetic\nlogic chip (7483-A) . This chip acts\nas a binary adder to generate a 4-bit\nword plus a carry. These 4-bit words\nplus carry are latched (7475-A) over\na PN clock period to give the correlation coefficient for each 1-bit shift\nof the input PN sequence.\nThis work was done by Allan\nLaderman of Caltech/JPL.

The\nprograms perform a two-dimensional\nelectrostatic analysis of the ceo\nstructure to determine whether\ncharge transfer is efficient.\nTwo-channel oxide thicknesses, two\nlevels of metalization, and variable\nchannel doping can be accommer\ndated. One of the programs can be\nused to analyze three-electrode\nceo input/output gates, and the\nother two programs can be used to\nanalyze twerphase structures containing two or four electrodes with\nperiodic boundary conditions .\nIn the past , analyses of ceo\nstructures have been conducted for\nthe ideal mode of operation in which\n\n524\n\nthe channel is depleted of minority\ncarriers except for those which are\ngated into the input end of the\nchannel and transferred by the\nattractive potential produced by the\ntransfer electrodes. In the ideal\noperating mode no barriers exist in\nthe interelectrode gap, and the\nnecessary condition for transfer,\nthat the attractive potential of the\nsucceeding electrode in the direction of transfer must exceed that of\nthe preceding , is also sufficient for\ntransfer. In practice, potential wells\nand barriers may exist and preclude\ncomplete charge transfer. Their\noccurrence depends upon ceo\nstructural parameters such as electrode geometry, oxide thickness,\nand channel dOping. Such phenomena must be investigated by twer\ndimensional analyses .\nThe complexities which arise in\nconSidering a realistic model\nsuggest a numerical approach. In\nthis package an approach based on\nGauss\' law is chosen because it\nallows for the treatment of discontinuities in a straight-forward\n\nmanner. A rectangular cell structure\nis chosen as convenient for the formulation of a discrete problem from\na continuous one. A twerpoint finitedifference formula is used to define\nthe gradient along each boundary of\nthe cell. The result of the model is\ntypically a large system of nonlinear\nsimultaneous equations .

The synchronizer\nnormalizes the system clock to the horizontal and vertical blanking, synchronizes the system according to the\ndigitize and reconstruct timing requirements, and stores the image address. The ALU (arithmetic-logic unit)\ncalculates new image start times and readout speeds. The memory controller selects the correct memory-page\nframe for read and for write. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters are used to interface with the\nvidicon camera and the cathode-ray tube screen.\nAn improved and simplified visual\nsimulator overcomes many of the\nproblems inherent in a previouslyused video trainer. In both the old\nand the new systems a model is\nscaled down in size to make it\nappear distant . It is driven back and\nforth on a track to control the\napparent distance , and its attitude is\ncontrolled by a gimbal drive. A TV\ncamera that records the motion of\nthe object is also gimbaled, to simulate the observer \'s attitude. The relative motions of both the observer\nand the object are displayed on a\nCRT screen.\nIn the conventional system , however , limitations in the track length\nrequired that two or three models ,\nscaled successively smaller, be\nused when the apparent maximum\nobject distance had to be much\ngreater than the minimum object\ndistance . One problem with this\nmultiple-model approach was that a\nseparate accurate gimbal had to be\nconstructed for each smaller model.\nFurthermore , any model changes\nhad to be machined into two or three\n\n528\n\nmodels , and a separate optical system was required to image correctly\neach additional model .\nThe improved system requires\nonly one model and a relativelysimple optical system . Gimbal orientation , raster shrinkage and deflection , and track movement are used\nto simulate attitude and range . For\nsimulation of short distances , out to\n600 ft (183 m) , only gimbal orientation and track movement are used .\nBeyond this range , the gimbal orientation is still used , but electronic\nraster shrinkage is employed for\nsizing the image .\nBecause the same gimbal\ncontrols attitude in both cases , the\nattitude is always mapped onto the\nvidicon faceplate correctly . There is\nno need for a dynamic mapping\ngenerator .\nA key component in the new system is a video digitizer that converts\nthe vidicon camera signal to digital\nform, processes it to reduce the\nimage size , and reconverts the\nprocessed data to an analog signal\nfor display on the CRT. As shown in\nthe block diagram, range informa-\n\ntion is fed to the digitizer from a\ncomputer . There are two memory\npages (frames 1 and 2) ; incoming\ndigitized video is stored in one page\nand is reconstructed from the other.\nThe page functions alternate each\ncycle .\nHorizontal video is reconstructed\nby utilizing the long (1 . 250-~s)\nvertical flyback time to calculate the\nimage size. To center the reconstructed image about the original , an\nimage offset counter signals the\nstart of a new image. The readout\nfrequency and the offset counter are\nboth dependent upon the range\nsignal . The vertical height of an\nimage is reduced by reading out less\nthan the full number of lines from\neach six-line raster segment .

The\nderived data are useful for estimating the limits on the variation of\ngroup delay with frequency or in\ndetermining how much reduction of\ndiscontinuities is necessary to\nachieve a given accuracy in predicting group delay.\nThe theory has been successfully\nconfirmed, using equipment\noperating at a frequency range of\n8.365 to 8.465 GHz; and additional\nsupportive data have been taken,\nusing equipment operating at a\nfrequency range of 2.235 to 2 .325\nGHz.\nThe analysis is mainly useful for\ncoaxial transmission-line problems,\nbut is sufficiently generalized to\ninclude most uniconductor waveguide applications as well. It is not\nassumed that the discontinuities\nmust be shunt susceptanees or that\nthe characteristic impedance of the\ntransmission line is identical to the\ncharacteristic impedances of the\nsystems on either side. Furthermore , it is not assumed that the\nreflections from the discontinuities\nare small or equal; the discontinuities can be lossy or lossless, and\nthey need not obey the reciprocity\ncondition .\nA graph of the limits of ~T(Figure\n1), a function of (3 which varies with\nfrequency, illustrates how the\nmethod works. It is assumed for\nsimplicity that the scattering coefficients t 22 1= nu l (see Figure 2)\nand that TgO = 100 ns . If\nI t 221 I nul ,one can assume\nthat the line has equivalent identical\n\nI\n\n\'*\n\n532\n\nI\n\n5\nc:\n\'"\n\n~\n\n<l\nu.\n\n0\n\nen\n\n2\n\n~\n\n::E\n:J\n+i\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.05\n\n0 .1\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n1 .0\n\nMAGNITUDE OF REFLECTION COEFFICIENT\nOF EACH DISCONTINUITY\n\nFigure 1. Calculated Limits of Cyclical Variation of Group Delay are\nshown for a 1~ns transmission line with identical discontinuities at\neach end. As an example of the use of the graph, assume that a\ntransmission line has a delay of 20 ns and a line attenuation of 5 dB prior\nto adding discontinuities of t\n= 0.4 and n11 = 0.1. Then an\nequivalent discontinuity placed at each end of this line would have a\nreflection coefficient magnitude of v\' (0.4) (0.1) = 0.2. From the graph\none finds that if the reflection coefficient magnitude of each discontinuity is 0.2 and the line attenuation is 5 dB for a 1oo-ns line, the limits of\ncyel ical variation are\xc2\xb12.5 ns. The limits of cyclical variation for the 20-ns\nline thus are\xc2\xb1 (20/1 00) (2.5) ns.\n\nI 221\n\nI\n\nI\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nZo1 1 Zo1\n\nI\n\nI\nlOSSY OR\nlOSS lESS\n2-PORT\n[L)\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI Z02\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nlOSSY OR\nlOSS lESS\n2-PORT\n[N)\n\nI\n\nZo2, y\n\nZ02 1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nZo1 1 Zo1\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\no\n\n8\n\ndiscontinuities at each end where\nthe equivalent discontinuity has a\nreflection coefficient magnitude\nequal to\n\nFigure 2.

The\n50-Hz power input to these units\nis continuously monitored for\nproper voltage and phasing. The\n50-Hz line occasionally experiences\nvoltage surges or spikes (possibly\nfrom transformer or other equipment malfunctions) resulting in\nminute interruptions. When these\noccur, the computer sensing-relay\nsystem immediately shuts down\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nthe system by disconnecting from\nthe line. This is a standard protection measure to ensure against\ndamage to the computer when\nsteady-state power is interrupted.\nWhen auto shutdown occurs,\nstartup is a lengthy process,\nespecially if the system was\nactively engaged with peripheral\ninputs at time of shutdown . An\nalternative involved the installation\nof an uninterrupted battery-backup\nsystem, at considerable cost.\nTests on a working system\nindicated that the great majority\nof 50-Hz interruptions were of less\nthan 1 second duration. Furthermore, the 400-Hz motors were\nable to provide a stable output\nfor at least 1 second subsequent to a 50-Hz input-power\nanomaly.\n\nA time delay relay was added\nto the system to delay sensingsystem cutoff action for 1 second.\nDuring a trial period, starting in\n1973, one facility had experienced\nfrom 15 to 20 short-duration power\ninterruptions during which the time\ndelay relays prevented normal\nshutdown . No damage to any of\nthe processors occurred. Costly\ndowntime was markedly curtailed,\nand requirements for expensive\npower supplies were avoided .\nAppropriate relays and time delays\ncan be selected to match the\nneeds of different computer\nfacilities .\nThis work was done by Clayton\nC.

A digital display of time-averaged signals with amplitudes varying over 11 decades is\npossible.\nFor many years experimenters\nhave been plagued with problems in\nmeasuring low-current signals in the\nampere range of 10-10 to 10-14\nTypical examples include dark\ncurrents of ionization detectors,\naccelerator-beam currents, outputs\nof Faraday cups, and the like.\nMeasured currents often vary 10 to\n50 percent in a few seconds. Previous methods have characteristically used strip-chart recorders\nand other signal-averaging devices\nand have been shown to be slow and\nrelatively inaccurate.\n\n534\n\nA simple method for time averaging and digitizing measurements of\nlow-current signals effectively\ncombines "off-the-shelf" instrumentation. Nuclear counting instrumentation (commonly referred to as\nnuclear instrumentation modules or\nNIM) makes up the bulk of the\nequipment, with the only exception\nbeing an electrometer (see figure) to\nmeasure current. Outputs from the\nelectrometer are switch selectable,\noto 1 Vdc or 0 to 1 mA. The current\noutput is used, thereby making the\nelectrometer essentially a high-gain\ncurrent amplifier.\n\nThe amplified signals are routed\nto a current digitizer (current-tofrequency converter) . The most\nsensitive range of the digitizer is\n10-9 A, so the electrometer must be\nused. The output from the current\ndigitizer are simple pulses, counted\nin the conventional NIM manner with\nselectable integration count times\nand selectable intervals between\ncounts. Scaler outputs are easily\nrecorded on a teleprinter.\nThis work was done by Robert G.\nRichmond of Johnson Space\nCenter.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nPhase-modulated signals with\nphase shifts ranging from 0\xc2\xb0 to 360\xc2\xb0\nmay be received and tracked without\nadjustment , using a new phaselocked detector . The detector,\nimplemented in S-band receivers ,\ntracks residual-carrier Signals ,\nsuppressed-carrier signals , analog\nmodulated signals, QPSK, and\nNPSK.\nThe receiver can track both the\ncarrier component and the series\nsideband component of the\nexpanded input signal , allowing it to\nreceive signals phase modulated\nfrom 0\xc2\xb0 to 3600 . The Signal is filtered\nto pass the carrier component at\npoint 0 in the illustration . The series\nsideband components are converted\nto a carrier signal at point B by\nmultiplying the demodulated Signal\n(point C) and the incoming signal at\nA. The tracking signal is a weighted\nsum of the residual carrier and the\nconverted series sideband carrier.\nIn the detector, a phase shifter is\nused to generate a negative phase\nshift opposing the detected phase\nangle . This produces the converted\nseries sideband and component\ncarrier , with the residual-carrier\nsignal and the converted series\nsideband and component carrier\nadded together to produce the\ntracking-carrier signal .\nBesides being less susceptible to\ncarrier interference (which may\ndegrade tracking), the detector can\ntrack on the converted series\nsideband carrier if the residual\ncarrier drops to zero or is degraded\nby interference .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W lnler 1976\n\nA 1/ 2 1/ P2(YP12 + v2 + 2P1\n/c{\nMULT\n\n--e---oi\n\nVpM (I) =\nAI csi n(wcl + kM(I))\n\ncos\n\nmi) slnwcl}\n\nj_---..\n\nRESIDUAL- 0\nCARRIER ....---.....\nFILTER\n\nX\n\nO\xc2\xb7 10 180\xc2\xb7 +\n180\xc2\xb7 10 360\xc2\xb7 -\n\nSUMMER\nWEIGHTED\nG\n\nB\n\n::: -RESIDUAL-CARRIER\nCOMPONENT sin e(l) SERIES SIDEBAND\nCOMPONENT2 sin 2e(l)\n\nDEMODULA TED\nOUTPUT\n\nThe Phase Lock Loop Detector tracks a phase-modulated signal from\n(1\' to 36(1\' . To track a signal with many phases, the detector, at point C,\ndetects the phase modulation from (1\' to 360" , and the phase shifter, at\npoint A, generates a negative phase shift opposite in angle to the\ndetected phase angle. The result is a stronger tracking signal for the\ndifferent phase angles, since the tracking signal consists of both\nresidual carrier and converted series sideband carrier component.

The compressed data are first coded by a Reed-Solomon coder and interleaver, followed by a convolutional encoder; its output is modulated and transmitted by a modulator/transmitter, wherein antipodal\nPSK-PM modulation of a square-wave subcarrier with S-band or X-band carrier takes place. The signals\ntransmitted are assumed to be subjected to wideband Gaussian noise. The system may include several\nnetwork stations (two shown above). Each station includes a receiver/demodulator that includes a phaselocked-loop coherent demodulator with 3-bit-quantized symbol output, which is decoded by a Viterbi decoder.\nThe output of the latter is decoded by a Reed-Solomon decoder and deinterleaver, located at a central dataprocessing center. The compressed data are decompressed by a data decompressor; its output is used to\nproduce an approximation of the uncompressed data, originally received by the compressor from the source.\nAn advanced imaging communication system has improved the efficiency in transmitting visual image\ninformation from deep space . The\nkey elements shown in the block\ndiagram are :\n-Imaging and nonimaging sensors,\n- Data compressor / decompressor,\n-An interleaved Reed-Solomon (RS)\nblock coder,\n- A convolutional-encoded lViterbidecoded telemetry channel, and\n\n536\n\n-Reed-Solomon decoding.\nData compression provides efficient representation of the sensor\ndata, and channel coding improves\nthe reliability of the data transmission. The interactions of data compression and channel coding are\nconsidered jointly in combining elements to increase system performance.\nWhen Reed-Solomon lViterbi\ncoding is used in conjunction with\n\ncompressed data, the probability of\na block of data being in error\nreduces rapidly for small increases\nin channel signal-to-noise ratio .\nTherefore, a low data-block error\nrate is achieved for error-sensitive\ndata, at nearly the same data rate as\nused for error-insensitive data.\nAnother characteristic of this\ncombination is the tendency of\nerrors to occur as large blocks interspersed between long runs of error-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nfree data . Compressed data are\nusually degraded as much by a\nsingle error as by large blocks of\nerrors . Therefore, when errors\noccur in large blocks instead of\nbeing randomly distributed, it is not\nnecessary to require an extremelylow average error rate to handle\nerror-sensitive data .\n\nAn independent evaluation by\nscientists demonstrated that use of a\nspecific data compressor as an\nelement of this system results in an\n"end-te-end" improvement in information return of four to seven times\nthat of present systems.\n\nThis work was done by Edward E.\nHilbert and Robert F.

Vapor-driven turbines for\ngenerating electricity can be made\nto operate at temperatures around\n3000 C, but the efficiency is much\nless than modern electric generators\ndriven by superheated steam at\n5500 C.\nA scheme based on chemical de-\n\ncomposition and recombination has\nbeen suggested as a technique for\nconverting energy collected at relatively low temperatures (e.g., 300 0\nC) to the higher temperatures\nrequired for efficient operation of\nsteam-driven electrical generators .\n(continued on next page)\n\n541\n\nThe proposed approach would\nutilize one or more of a class of\ncyclical reversible chemical reactions in which a compound is made\nto decompose and absorb thermal\nenergy at a "low" temperature by\nshifting the equilibrium. The decomposed substances, having a higher\nchemical potential than the original\nsubstance, could then be recombined. With the proper choice of reactant, the exothermal recombination will occur at a temperature considerably higher than that required\nfor the decomposition .\nCandidate reactions include the\nfollowing :\n2NH3 ~ N2 + 3H 2\nCH 30H ~CO+ 2H2\n2H 20 ~ 2H2 + O 2\nMgH2 (or other metal hydride)\n~Mg+ H2\nBa0 2 ~ BaO+ 1/2 O 2\nThe processes, of course, are not\nsimply implemented, and reaction\n\nefficiencies and kinetics must be\nconsidered in designing the system .\nFor instance, the decomposition\nshould be carried out at low pressure , and the recombination at high\npressure; the efficiency could be\naugmented by thermal diffusion,\nmolecular skimming , or similar\ntechniques.\nThe concept is illustrated for the\ndecomposition/ recombination of\nammonia . The ammonia working\nfluid would be decomposed as it\npasses through a catalyst-lined tube\nat the focus of a fixed-axis solar\nthermal absorber. This reaction,\noccurring at around 300\xc2\xb0 C, would\nabsorb heat and produce free N 2\nand H2. These could then be recombined to produce heat at a temperature on the order of 500\xc2\xb0 C.\nAlthough considerable development is yet required to produce a\nworking system based on this principle, a laboratory-scale device using\n\nthe decomposition and recombination of H 20 is described in NASA\nTech Brief B75-1 0314 . Although not\na closed system as described here,\nand operating at higher temperatures, it has been shown possible to\nremove hydrogen by diffusion\nthrough selective membranes to\naccelerate the H.p decomposition in\na hydrogen-generating experiment.\nThis work was done by Charles G.\nMiller of Caltech/JPL.

Tracking collectors more efficiently collect solar flux than nontracking versions , but this advantage\nis offset by increased maintenance\ncosts .\nA fixed , but reversible , concentrator with a vacuum tube receiver\nhas been developed which combines\nmuch of the efficiency of a tracking\nconcentrator with the lower cost of a\nfixed design . The trough concentrator can maintain a year-round\nconcentration factor of 2 (or better)\nfor the most significant collection\nperiod of the day, with the factor\nimprovement most noticeable\naround the winter and summer\nsolstices. To date , the trough has\nbeen used with an evacuated receiver and also with a fixed , flatplate collector .\n542\n\nThe concentrator is fabricated\nfrom individual, asymmetrical veeshaped members having two sides,\neach of which presents a different\npreselected slope angle to the Sun.\nInexpensive polished sheet metal or\nplastic-reflector-laminated sheet\nmetal covering most of the solar\ncollection area is used. In one\narrangement, individual members\nare ganged together to form a\nmodular assembly adapted to ease\nreversing their orientation at appropriate intervals. In another arrangement, the concentrator is made up\nof hinged flaps which form opposite\nsides of the vee trough . Corresponding sides of the trough members are\nganged together for operation via\npush rod ; orientation is reversed at\nappropriate intervals by manipulating the rods .\nWhen the vee-trough reflector is\nused with an evacuated-tube energy\nreceiver (absorber) , each absorber\n\nincludes a black plate to which a\ntube is attached . The tubes are supported within an evacuated clearwall cylinder; the lower half of the\nsurface of the cylinder may be provided with a reflector surface to\nreduce rear losses.\nThe plane in which the apparent\nmotion of the Sun takes place is\nperpendicular to the collector plane\n(which is tilted to latitude twice a\nyear on spring and fall equinoxes) .\nThe tilt of this plane during winter\nand summer seasons is less than\n90" or more than 90" , respectively,\nas shown in the figure , whereas\nsymmetric vee-trough reflectors\nwould require collector periodic tilt\nchanges to maintain efficiency. The\nasymmetric reflector, however,\neliminates the need for a collector\ntilt change ; instead, the mirror\nassembly is reversed on the\nequinoxes.

The waste\ntravels upward within the hydrofoil and is ejected into the horizontal vortex that forms near the tip of the\nhydrofoil and trails far downstream.\nA specially-designed hydrofoil\nsystem can be used at any facility\ndischarging waste into naturalflowing waters, such as rivers,\nchannels , or the oceans , to direct\nthe flow of such pollutants and to\ncontrol their dispersion. It could be\nused similarly at offshore oil\nterminals which are susceptible to\noilspills . The hydrofoil works by\nkeeping these pollutants concentrated within a long, trailing vortex\ngenerated by the hydrofoil and either\ndeflecting the vortex \xc2\xb7away from sensitive regions or sweeping it from\nside to side for rapid disperSion. This\nhydrofoil system as illustrated consists of a vertical semispan hydrofoil\nanchored in the water bed and set at\nan angle of attack with respect to the\nambient water flow.\nThe hydrofoil exerts control, for\nan extended time, over the direction\nof flow and dispersion of concentrated pollutants after they have\nentered natural-flowing waters. The\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1976\n\npollutants are confined by the\nvortex , until it breaks up at some\npoint far downstream, and can be\ndeflected horizontally, at angles up\nto about 1C? from the direction of\nthe free stream, by adjusting the\nangle of attack and configuration of\nthe hydrofoil. In this manner the\neffluent flow may be deflected away\nfrom oysterbeds , beaches, and\nother regions where it would be\nharmful. It can also be swept from\nside to side by alternating the settings of the hydrofoil, in order to\naccelerate dispersion of the\npollutant.\nThe point where the effluent is\nreleased can be extended further\ndownstream by placing a second\nhydrofoil at the vortex breakup point\nto regenerate the vortex. With the\naddition of successive hydrofoils,\nthe effluent pipeline can be continued almost indefinitely in water\nwhere the flow direction does not\nvary with time. Minor changes in the\n\nflow direction may be corrected for\nby varying the angle of attack of\neach hydrofoil to keep its vortex\nalined with the next hydrofoil.\nIt is also possible to use a horizontal hydrofoil that is mounted on a\nstreamlined strut and is oriented\nperpendicular to the flow . If set at a\nnegative angle of attack, the hydrofoil generates two trailing vortexes\nthat are deflected upward to the\nwater surface where Sunlight and air\nwould interact with the effluent.\nAlternatively, setting the hydrofOil at\na positive angle of attack would\ndeflect the trailing vortexes and the\neffluent downward to the water bed.\nThis work was done by Robert C.\nCosten of Langley Research\nCenter.

This Multiplexed Data System for monitoring water currents\nat 32 flood-plain locations has a data acquisition unit designed for\nparticular sensors. However, its use of memory is broadly applicable\nwhere one processing unit serves many measurement channels.\nWaterflow rates sensed by pygmy\nmeters at as many as 32 different\nlocations can be continuously measured and recorded by a Single data\nacquisition unit, as shown in Figure\n1. This system, which was developed for flood-plain monitoring ,\nfunctions reliably even when the\nelectrical contacts of the watermeter are submerged . Moreover,\nthe operating life of the contacts is\n\n550\n\nprolonged by the time-division multiplexing in this system . The data\nacquisition unit is inexpensive,\ncompact, and portable and operates\nin open air over wide ranges of temperature and humidity.\nThe water flowing through the\npygmy current meter rotates an\nelement that closes an electrical\ncontact once every revolution , so\nthe rate of flow is measured by\n\ncounting the number of closures in a\ntime interval. For this purpose the\ndata acquisition unit is connected to\nthe electrical contacts of each of the\n32 watermeters by a twisted pair of\nwires. Using a master clock for\ntiming and control , the unit sequentially pulses these sensor lines for 5\nmicroseconds, 100 times per\nsecond. If the contacts are closed at\nthe moment of pulsing , they carry a\nhusky 30D-miII iampere signal, which\nis easily distinguished from the electricalleakage and noise signals that\ncan occur when open contacts are\npulsed.

The major\nfactor limiting the sensitivity of\nacoustic and other spectrophone\ndevices is the spurious signal produced by heating cell windows: the\nabsorption coefficient equivalent to\nwindow heating is about 10-5\nm- 1 /W or higher.\nNow, smaller coefficients can be\ndetermined by using for measurements of absorption a differential\nspectrophone that measures only\nthe difference in pressure between\ntwo cells with a differential capacitive manometer. The background\nsignal is reduced by the balanced\nwindow heating and balanced\ncarrier-gas absorption in the two\ncells.\nTo improve further the differential\nspectrophone, a "folded" optical\npath is used (see figure). This allows\na differential microphone to be\nplaced between two cells with short\nconnecting ports and, therefore,\nreduces unexcited-gas volumes .\nAlso, the cell walls have been\ntapered to conform to the light-wave\nexpansion and thus further reduce\nthe nonexcited volume . The background noise is equivalent to a coefficientof3 .3X10-7 m-1 /W, about\n100 times better than a single-cell\nspect rophone.\nThe body of the differential\nspectrophone is a metal block,\napproximately 4 in .

In general , silver in a\ndeveloped film is converted to a\nradioactive compound . The level or\ndensity of silver in the film controls\nthe optical transmission of the film\nand forms the image. After converting the silver to a radioactive\ncompound, the image is transferred\nto a second film which is sensitive to\nradioactive beta particles.\nConventionally the silver on the\nfilm is converted to a radioactive\ncompound by reaction with sulfides\nor polysulfides consisting primarily\nof sulfur-35, a (J emitter. This\nprocess has had several disadvantages that limited its usefulness,\nsuch as only moderate effectiveness\n\nand the production of toxic and\nradioactive gases.\nThe technique of autoradiography\nhas now been made suitable for\nmuch broader use by a new method\nof chemically activating the film or\nplate with sulfur-35 which bypasses\nordinary toning chemistry. This\nmethod retains the advantages of\nusing the sulfur isotope and virtually\neliminates the disadvantages usually\nexperienced with previous forms of\nfilm autoradiography. The activating\nsolution consists of organic sulfur\nmolecules, such as 2-thiourea-S35 ,\ndissolved in water. A small amount\nof alkali is added just before the film\nis processed . After processing, the\nfilm is simply rinsed with water or\nwater-methanol solutions .\nSome advantages of this process\nare:\n- There are no colloidal compounds\nformed in the solution , and there is\nno problem of colloidal-sulfur settling in the gelatin.\n- It is not necessary to convert the\nimage silver to silver halide prior to\nprocessing . The extra time, inconvenience, inexactness , and the\n\ncolloidal precipitation problems\ncaused by this step are avoided.\n- The original film is not degraded by\nthis process .\n- Sulfur-35 is a pure beta emitter,\nand there is no accompanying\ngamma radiation to fog nearby\nfilms or cause a health hazard.\n- The half-life of sulfur-35 is 88 days .\nIt is long enough for the activating\nsolution to last a reasonable\namount of time and for large quantities of autoradiographs to be\nmade from an activated negative.\nYet, it is short enough that, if\ndesired, radioactive wastes and\nnegatives can be kept in storage\nand allowed to become inactive\nwith time. This eliminates most\ndisposal problems.\nThis work was done by Barbara S.\nAskins of Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

Other advantages to be\ngained are reduced average-power\nconsumption and the Simplicity of\nexposure control.\nIn the modified system , the\ncamera-drive functions are separated mechanically into two groups\nwhich are driven by two separate\nmotors. The first motor, a 90\xc2\xb0\nstepper, drives the rotating shutter.\nThe second , an electronicallycommutated dc motor, drives the\nclaw and film transport. The shutter\nis made of one piece but has twoopenings: one 90\xc2\xb0 segment for slow\nexposures and a smaller opening for\nfast exposu res (see Figu re 1).\nCAMERA\nAPERTURE\n\nFOR FAST\nEXPOSURE\n\nFigure 1. The Dual Shutter as\nviewed from the lens has a 90\xc2\xb0\nopening used for exposure times\nof 1/125 second. The narrow\nshutter opening is used for shorter exposure times with the motor\nrotating continuously through\ntwo steps of 180\xc2\xb0. Speed is\ncontrolled to give the desired\nexposure time.\n\n554\n\nThere is a 1-t0-1 ratio between the\nstepper motor and the shutter. A\nSingle exposure consists of two 90\xc2\xb0\nsteps of the motor, the shutter\nrotates goo and is held in the open\nposition for a time suitable for correct exposure. It then rotates\nanother 90\xc2\xb0 to close the shutter .\nEach succeeding exposure is made\nby reversing the di rection of rotation . For faster exposures, two 180\xc2\xb0\nrotations of the narrow opening are\nemployed.\nOptical sensors determine the\nshutter position (see Figure 2) and\nare used to time pulses that control\nthe stepper motor. The timing of the\ninput pulses to the motor is controlled to keep the change in shutter\nangle constant. This provides a\nuniform exposure . By varying the\npulse voltage, the speed of the\nshutter and thus the exposure time\nmay be changed .\nTo limit overshoot at the completion of the shutter travel a timed\nretarding pulse is applied to the\nstepper motor (see Figure 2) . If this\nwere not done, the shutter would be\nsubject to oscillations at the end of\neach exposure, allowing additional\nlight onto the film plane.\nThe second motor is operated\ncontinuously at high camera speeds\n(frame rates). For low frame rates\nand pulse modes the motor is operated in a start/stop fashion . The only\nrequirement on position is that the\nclaw be brought to rest during the\nportion of the cycle when it is extracted from the film .\nA command from the control\nelectronics starts the cycle, and an\ninternal signal triggered from a predetermined position of the claw\nstops the motor. The master control\nof frame rate is from the regulated\nspeed of the claw drive for the\nhigher frame rates and from the\nelectronics start command for the\nlower frame rates.

For\ninstance, pulsed laser beams are\nalways expanded with negative or\ndiverging lenses. Dust and\nscratches on their surfaces scatter\nthe light, thereby creating "noise"\nthat causes extraneous interference\nfringes to the beam pattern . When\npulsed laser light is used to study\nparticulates, live bacteria, dust, and\nthe like, background light scattering\n- the " noise" - swamps the small\namounts of light scattered from the\ntest objects . Therefore, a spatial\nfilter (one that blocks light coming\nfrom all directions other than the\ndesired direction) is essential to\nsuch studies .\nConventionally, laser beams are\nspatially filtered by focusing the\nbeam through a small pinhole. This\napproach works with any of the gas\nlasers such as helium/neon. However, with a Q-switched solid-state\nlaser such as ruby or neodymium\n(about 1 joule in a tenth of a microsecond) , the intense alternating\noptical-energy fields about the focal\nregion ionize the air and cause a\nbright spark. A preponderance of the\nlaser energy is absorbed by creation\nof the spark. Moreover, the proximity of a metal aperture with a pinhole\nreduces the energy at which breakdown occurs .\nA solution other than the obvious\none of reducing the power in the\nlaser beam was needed.\n\n558\n\nSPATIAL\nFILTER\n\nHORIZONTAL\nLINE FOCUS\n\nA Set of Compound Lenses reduces ionization and sparks that\nfrequently occur around the pinhole aperture in the spatial filter of a\nQ-switched laser. The lens system produces an astigmatic focus near\nthe pinhole, reducing the energy level there below the ionization\nthreshold.\nThis new innovation (shown in the\nfigure) consists of a cylindrical lens\nwhich has finite and infinite focal\nlengths and a pair of lenses having\nfinite focal lengths. This compound\nlens system produces an astigmatic\nfocus close to the aperture of the\nspatial filter and thus reduces the\nhigh optical energy below the level\nthat produces ionization of air.\nThe spatial filter is an opaque\nmaterial (aluminum in this case)\nhaving a 1-mm (O .039-in .) pinhole.\nThis filter is positioned between the\ntwo astigmatic line focuses . Precise\npositioning does not appear to be\ncritical.\nTests with the new spatial filter\nverified that breakdown will not\noccur with the cylinder lens added .\nRemoval of the lens, however, does\nresult in breakdown and a complete\ndisruption of the incidental laser\nenergy. Other combinations of weak\ncylinder lenses with short-focus\n\npositive lenses were also made to\nwork.\nThis technique has been proved\nuseful in large-area holography and\nis probably applicable to all\nQ-switched pulse laser operations .\nThis work was done by Lee O.\nHeflinger and Ralph F.

In this way, a\nlarge source of potential error is\neliminated. Radiometer calibration\nis normally achieved by replacing\nthe antenna with a cooled reference\ntermination and then applying\ncorrections for ohmic and reflective\nlosses of the antenna and for the\nnonideality of the reference termination . However, imprecisions of the\ncorrection process for some applications are unacceptably large.\nThe improved temperature reference is a piece of porous microwave absorber (having a convoluted\nsurface for low reflection coefficient) fitted with a cap of nonporous\nplastic foam. The foam mating\nsurface is the inverse of that of the\nabsorber. The microwave absorbing\nmaterial is then soaked with a\ncryogen such as liquid nitrogen or\nargon; the nonporous cap forces the\nliquid to conform to the shape of the\nabsorbing material. This procedure\nensures that the temperature at\nwhich the microwaves are absorbed\n(and therefore thermally emitted) is\nexactly that of the cryogen, and it\navoids the reflection that would be\nproduced by the dielectric discontinuity of a plane surface of cryogen .\nThe microwave reflection from the\nexternal surface of the nonporous\nfoam cap is very small due to the low\ndensity of the foam. (If necessary ,\nthe external surface of the foam\ncould also be convoluted .) The\nmicrowave loss within the foam is\nalso very small due to the low\ndensity and low intrinsic loss of this\nplastic material.\n\nANTENNA\n\nNONPOROUS\nPOL YURETHAN E\nFOAM\n\nPOROUS MICROWAVE\nABSORBER SATURATED\nWITH BOILING CRYOGEN\n\nINSULATION\n\nThe Precision Reference Load for an S-Band Radiometer uses a\npyramid-shaped absorber placed at the bottom of a thermally-insulated\nmetal box. A cap of expanded polyurethane is foamed over the absorber.\nUnder far-field plane wave conditions the absorber has a specular\nreflectivity of -40 dB. When filled with LN2 to the tips of the absorber,\nthe average VSWR of the reference is 1.020 (2.7 GHz), equivalent to a\npower reflection coefficient of 1x1o-4 (emissivity of 0.9999).\nA calibration reference load for\nS-band radiometers is shown . A\npiece of microwave absorber, 2 feet\n(0.2 m) square, with convolutions in\nthe shape of close-packed square\n\npyramids is placed in the bottom of a\nthermally-insulated metal box, and a\ncap of expanded polyurethane is\nfoamed over it. The foam is then\nmilled flat to a level about 1 in . (2.5\n\n(continued on next page)\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1976\n\n561\n\ncm) above the tips of the absorber .\nVertical ventholes 0.5 in. (1.3 cm) in\ndiameter are drilled into the foam at\nthe positions of the peaks of the\nmicrowave absorber to allow the\nescape of the gas produced by the\nboiling cryogen. The holes also\nensure that all of the absorber is\nsaturated with cryogen .\nTwo vertical holes of 1 in. (2.5\ncm) diameter are drilled near the\ncorners of the box to facilitate filling\nthe unit with cryogen . An arrangement of brackets (made of metal,\nplastic foam, or other material)\nsecured to the side of the box may\n\nbe necessary to prevent the\ncombined assembly of foam cap and\nmicrowave absorber from floating in\nthe cryogen . Strips of expanded\npolystyrene glued with epoxy to the\ninner sides of the box are used.\nThe absorber has a specular\nreflectivity of -40 dB under far-field\nplane-wave conditions . However, a\nfraction of 1 percent of incident radiation may be diffusely scattered in\nrandom directions. For this reason a\nshroud of aluminum foil is used to\nmake electrical contact between the\nradiometer antenna and the top of\nthe metallic box in such a way that,\n\nexcluding the small horizontal ventholes, the total assembly could not\nbe penetrated by external\nmicrowave sources. This ensures\nthat all energy entering the antenna\noriginates in the cooled absorbing\nmaterial .\nThis work was done by Allan W.\nLove, Marinus J. VanMelle, Albert\nC. Jones, and Walter N.

As a consequence, the\nquantum efficiency (ratio of number\nof photoelectrons per photon) of an\nX-ray photocathode is low.\nThe special photocathode\nassembly shown in the figure\nimproves the quantum efficiency by\na dual process . First, a fraction of\nthe incoming X-rays are converted\nto photoelectrons at the photocathode. Second, X-rays that pass\nthrough the photocathode and a thin\nX-ray transparent membrane (e.g.,\nglass or mica) enter a phosphor\nscreen.\nA light-reflecting surface (an\nevaporated-aluminum coating or a\nmirror substrate) backs up the\nphosphor screen to redirect its rearemitted light towards the photocathode.\nThe X-rays absorbed in the\nphosphor screen produce light tha\ntravels back to the photocathode to\nproduce the bulk of the photoelectrons .

The two types share the same\nfocusing lenses and reference\nbeam .\nOptical components are mounted\nto a frame as rigidly as possible . An\naluminum enclosure at one end of\nthe holocamera contains the sliding\nplate and one front surface mirror\n(for the focused ground glass configuration) ; it also serves to anchor\nthe shield between the diffuser and\nthe focusing lens set. The referencebeam prisms are mounted below the\naluminum enclosure on a steel plate\nwelded to the tubular framework.\nThe lens for spreading the reference\nbeam is mounted on the same plate .\nINTERM EDIATE\nFOCUSING LENS\n\nINPUT\nLASER\nBEAM\nREFERENCE\nBEAM\n\nThe Dual-Purpose Holocamera utilizes the same basic structure for a scattered-light and for a bright-field\nholography.

This\nmirror is mounted on a platform that\nis tilted to direct the reference beam\nonto the hologram at an angle of 45\ndegrees (relative to the axis of the\nfocusing lenses).\nThe beam from the illuminating\nlaser is deflected into the holocamera by a right-angle reflecting\nprism. Depending on the position of\nthe sliding plate, the beam either\nilluminates the bright-field holographic arrangement or the darkfield scattered-light holographic\narrangement. The reference path is\nthe same for both the bright-field\nand scattered-light arrangements .\n\nWhen configured as a scatteredlight holocamera, light from a pulsed\nruby laser illuminator is deflected\ninto the holocamera by the prism\nreflector mounted below the tubular\nframework. The light is deflected\nvertically onto a glass-wedge beam\nsplitter which divides it into sceneand reference-beam components .\nThe reference beam is the small\nportion reflected from the first\nsurface of the wedge . The scenebeam component is the principal\namount of light transmitted through\nthe wedge. The intermediate focusing lenses are used to refocus the\nlight just before the hologram.\nWhen in the bright-field arrangement , the portion of the beam passing through the lens hits the front\n\nsurface mirror mounted at the top of\nthe aluminum enclosure. This reflects the light onto the prism plate ,\nwhich directs the beam through the\nfocusing lens set onto the hologram\nphotographic plate .

To extend the\nmagnification range, the field is\nreversed in direction between\nthe object and image planes.\nThis means that the current in\ncoil 3 flows in the oppOSite\ndirection to the current in coil 1 .\nplanes (see Figure 2) . A multiplecoil design of the field-generation\n\nand control section enables the\nmagnetic field to be reversed over\nthe length of the image-electron\npath. Under normal conditions, only\nsmall variations in image magnification are possible; but with the\nmultiple-coil deSign, it can be increased by a factor of 4.\nThis principle could be implemented by the magnifying image\nintensifier shown in Figure 3.

LACOMA\n(Laser Communicator Analysis\n\nProgram) represents a major\nadvance in the optical analysis of\nlaser heterodyne communication\nsystems and also in general opticalsystems analysis, since it includes\nthe effects of gaussian pupil functions . A major difference between\nLACOMA and other programs in this\nfield is that LACOMA utilizes an\nalgorithm that permits specification\nof the number and the location of the\noutput points for the computed\nspread function results. For a given\noptical system or telescope, the\nprogram allows sampling of the Airy\ndisk via grid sizes from 2 by 2 to 101\nby 101 . The program allows the\noptional analysis of transmitter or\nreceiver optiCS. For the transmitter ,\nthe program starts with the data for\nthe specified laser beam and propagates the beam through the optical\ntrain to determine the far-field\nintensity function . For the receiver,\nthe program carries the received\nsignal beam through the optical train\nto the detector. The local oscillator\nlaser beam is also traced to the\ndetector where the two beams are\ncombined , and the various quality\ncriteria are computed. Paraxial\nanalysis, ray trace-optical path difference analysiS , amplitude and\npoint spread function analysis,\nreceiver quality criteria analysis,\nand transmitter quality criteria\nanalysis are performed by the\nprogram .\nSome optical system parameters\nand/ or configurations which can be\naccommodated by LACOMA are:\n-Catoptric systems\n-Catadioptric systems\n-Dioptric systems\n-Spherical surfaces\n-Aspheres\n-Cylindrical surfaces\n-Toroidal surfaces\n-Surfaces with slight cylindrical\nerror or warpage\n-Periodic surface errors\n-Misalined (tilted , and/or\ndecentered) systems\n-Composite vignetting and\nobscuration\n-Afocal systems (via perfect\nimaging lens)\nAny of the analyses can be performed for any of the system parameters\nor configurations.\nLACOMA has been shown to be a\n\nuseful tool for the analysis of\nheterodyne communication\nsystems.

It can\nbe used to evaluate the merit of a\nparticular active optics control\nsystem (or a component subsystem) ; and once the system configuration is chosen, it can be used\nas a design aid to optimize the\nsystem parameters. AOSS is a\nvaluable tool for determining factors\nsuch as the number of required\nactuators, placement of actuators,\nand the mirror-surface improvement\ngained from additional actuators.\nAOSS consists of three major\ncomputer program packages : the\nAuxiliary Program, the NASTRAN\nStructural Analysis Program, and\nthe Active Optics Simulation\nProgram (AOSP). The Auxiliary\nProgram accepts as input an active\noptics structural model expressed in\nterms of engineering parameters\nmeaningful to the designer and\ngenerates a complete NASTRAN\nInput Deck which consists of the\nExecutive Control Deck, Case\nControl Deck, and Bulk Data Deck.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\n567\n\nNASTRAN performs structural\nanalysis on the following components of the optics system:\n-Mirror\n-Backing Plate\n-Actuators\n-Mirror Mounts\n-System Reaction Support\nIn the structural modeling, a lumped\nelement approach is followed . The\ndistributed structural properties of\nthe system are represented by a\nfinite number of idealized elastic\nelements, which are connected by a\nfinite number of grid points . The\nboundary conditions are formulated\nby constraining appropriate degrees\nof freedom at the boundary grid\npoints . Multipoint constraints are\nused to describe linear algebraic\nrelations between two or more\ndegrees of freedom where necessary. The main purpose of the structural modeling is to obtain eigenvectors (mode shapes) for use in the\ncontrol-system equations of the\nActive Optics Simulator Program by\nperforming a real eigenvalue\nanalysis (normal-mode vibration\nanalysis) . In addition, the flexibility\nmatrix of the system is obtained to\nmodel the displacement actuators\nand to calculate static response to\nthermal, inertial, and mechanical\nloading.\nNASTRAN output in card form is\nused as input to the AOS Program,\nwhich consists of six modules to\nsimulate the entire mirror-surface\ncontrol system . The Interpolation\nModule is a curvilinear bicubic\nspline-fit program compatible with\nthe polar coordinate system as required by the circular geometry of\nthe mirror structure. The Control\nLaw Module simulates the modal\ncontrol law using the technique of\nCreedon and Lindgren. The Actuator\nModule includes the effects of backlash, dead zone, saturation of the\nelectronics, and electronic time\nconstants to simulate the force\nactuator.

Ground control\npoints are features or landmarks\nwhich are visible in the image and\nwhose map coordinates can be\ndetermined.

Although\nthey have no known toxic effects,\nthe lignins and their degradation\nproducts add an unesthetic color to\nthe waste water. These highly\ncolored materials prevent light penetration and photosynthesis in\nbodies of water where they are discharged . The problem is appreciable\nbecause over 1.9 trillion gallons of\nwater are discharged into waterways\nby the pulp and paper industry each\nyear.\nA new process that has been\nstudied on the laboratory scale may\nbe able to remove and purify lignins\neconomically enough to encourage\nadoption throughout the industry.\nQuaternary ammonium compounds\nare used to precipitate out the\nlignins from the waste water .\nMethanol is used to recover the\nquaternary ammonium compounds .\nCompared to a lime-precipitation\nprocess currently used, this method\nmay economically recover lignins\nand clean up an objectional waste\nwater problem (Figure 2).\nThe process, as described in\nFigure 1, has been tested with the\nchlorine wash from a sulfite pulp mill\nand with the caustic wash from a\nKraft process pulp mill.

Urea is first converted to NH ..+ and CO 2 by\nenzymatic action . The ammonium\nion is subsequently removed by ion\nexchange. The technique was developed for a closed system in which\nwaste water from two adult bullfrogs\nis recirculated from the aquatic\nhabitat to a treatment tank, through\nan ion-exchange column, and back\nto the habitat. Provision is made for\ncontrol flow, temperature, pH, and\noxygen balance. Bioburden is controlled by filtration through 0.45,..\nMillipore filters or by ozonation for 5\nmin/gal (1.5 min/liter).\nWater in the treatment tank is\ntreated at the onset of a predeter-\n\n572\n\nmined period with urease, a\ncommon enzyme that is known to\ncatalyze the hydrolysis of urea to\nammonium ion and carbon dioxide.\nThe rate of reaction is increased by\nagitation and by control of pH. The\ntreated water is passed through an\nion-exchange column, selected for\npreferential absorption of ammonium ions, and then is returned to the\nhabitat with nontoxic quantities of\nurea and ammonium ion.\nThe results of tests in an aerobic\nenvironment indicate that the\nremoval process functions well at\n16.5\xc2\xb0 and 25\xc2\xb0 C at a flow rate of\nabout 360 ml/min. The decomposition of urea shows little sensitivity to\nvariation in concentrations of\npotassium, sodium, calcium, and\nmagnesium ions in the aqueous\nmedium. The two bullfrogs were\n\nmaintained for 30 days in recirculated water containing all their dissolved wastes.

The mixture\nis placed in a settling tank where the\ndissolved pollutants are adsorbed by\nthe activated carbon, and the\ncarbon and suspended matter,\ncalled sludge, collect on the bottom\nof the tank . A major expense in this\nprocess is the activated carbon that\nmust be added continuously.\nAt some plants costs are reduced\nby collecting the sludge and converting it to activated carbon .\nHowever, it is not possible to prcr\nduce enough carbon to make the\nprocess self-sustaining, and additional activated carbon must be\nadded to make up the deficiency. In\na new process, the supplemental\ncarbon is derived from a coal, such\nas lignite, which costs less than 2\ncents a pound delivered, compared\nto around 25-30 cents a pound for\nthe activated carbon . The coal is\npyrolyzed along with the sludge,\nwhich acts as a catalyst in the activation process. In addition, pyrolysis\nof the coal produces flammable\ngases that can provide part of the\nenergy needed for the process .\nLaboratory-scale studies have\nindicated the feasibility of the\nmethod. Coal was pulverized to -40\nmesh and mixed with an equal\namount of sludge; the pyrolysis and\nactivation conditions were 850" C\nwith steam applied for 20 minutes\nwith about 1 pound of steam per\npound of coal/sludge mixture. The\nresulting activated carbon was 61 .7\npercent ash and had an iodine adsorption of 684 mg/g of carbon.\nAfter a raw sewage sludge sample\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\nRAW\nSEWAGE\n\nACTIVATED\nCARBON\n\nSETILING TANK\n\nDRIED\nSLUDGE\nLIGNITE\n\n::.\n\n~IFILTER\n\nACTIVATED\nCARBON\n\nFLAMMABLE\nGAS FOR\nUSE AS FUEL\n\nPYROLYZING\nFURNACE\n\nThe Lignite-Aided Sewage Treatment is based on the adsorption of\ndissolved pollutants by activated carbon. After settling, the sludge is\nremoved and dried into cakes that are pyrolyzed with lignite to yield\nactivated carbon. The lignite is less expensive than the activated carbon\nthat was previously used to supplement the pyrolysis yield.\nwith a COD (chemical oxygen\ndemand) of 421 was treated with\n521 mg / I of the activated carbon, its\nCOD was reduced to 59. (Treatment\nof the sludge with a commercial\nactivated carbon gave a COD of 60 .)\nFurther tests with bituminous and\nsub-bituminous coals showed that\nlignite was the most effective type,\nalthough it is also the least expensive. Sodium carbonate can be\nadded to the process to fu rther\nenhance the activation.\n\nThis work was done by John D.\nIngham, John J. Kalvinskas, and\nWilliam A.

With all currently-known\nprocesses , however , coalliquefaction cannot yet compete economically with natural oil . Two of the\nprimary reasons are the high processing costs and the low yields.\nAn improved process, developed\nby NASA and Caltech / Jet Propulsion\nLabs, has been tested on a laboratory scale and promises a significant\nreduction in the costs of coalliquefied oils. The basic process that\n\nhas been improved upon is one in\nwhich coal , under high temperature\nand hydrogen pressure, is converted\nto an intermediate product called\nasphaltene . The intermediate is\nfurther processed under less severe\nconditions to yield a mixture of liquid\noils and an insolube residue . The\nyield of usable oils is currently on the\norder of 40 to 50 percent under the\nconditions tested .\nThis yield has been increased to\nabove 80 percent by the addition of a\nnonaqueous surfactant comprising\nhydrocarbon and amine groups ,\nsuch as alkyl polyamine . Such surfactants are already available as\ncommercial products .\n\nThe role of the surfactant can be\nunderstood from the process descriptions in Figures 1 and 2.\nAlthough the exact molecular mechanisms involved have not been\nproven , it appears that the surfactant prevents the asphaltene molecules from clumping together to\nform colloidal particles . The separated molecules present more\nsurface area for the addition of\nhydrogen atoms during the hydrogenation reaction and are also less\nlikely to polymerize to form an insoluble residue.\nEconomically, this proposed\nprocess could lead to reductions in\nboth capital and operating costs by\n\nHYDROGEN\nHIGH-TEMPERATURE\nHEAT\n\nHYDROGEN\nHIGH\nPRESSURE\n\nHEAT\n\nPOLAR\nASPHAL TENE SPECIES\nIN NONPOLAR SOLVENT\n\nPARTICLES FORM\nCOLLOIDS (POLAR\nTO SOLVENT)\n\nPRESSURE\n\nOILS\n\nSOLVENT RECYCLE\n\nFigure 1. Coal-to-Oil Conversion is accomplished by first dissolving the coal in a solvent and decomposing it\nunder high temperature and pressure.

This unknown\ncomposition must ultimately be\nseparated from the starting materials and analyzed to determine its\ntrue composition . A simple technique has been developed for\nobtaining eutectic material for\nchemical analysis in order to determine the composition of the eutectic\nconstituent in an off-eutectic alloy.\nThis technique is particularly useful\nfor finding the eutectic composition\nof a new multicomponent alloy\nsystem in the absence of the alloy\nphase equilibria data . It has been\ndemonstrated successfully on\nseveral multicomponent alloys.\nA cast ingot of a trial melt, made\nwhile seeking the eutectic composition , is placed in a tube crucible. It is\nthen positioned vertically in a\nfurnace as shown in the figure. The\nbottom end of the crucible is located\noutside the furnace hot zone .\nThe sample bar is slowly heated\nunder an inert atmosphere to\nprevent oxidation . As the temperature approaches the melting point ,\nmolten alloy of the eutectic composition characteristically bleeds from\nthe surface of the sample . The\nbleedout runs to the bottom of the\ncrucible where it accumulates in the\nspace between the bar and the\ncrucible wall . The accumulated melt\nis solidified at the bottom of the\nfurnace by air or water cooling.\nWhen the top portion of the bar\ncompletely melts, the furnace power\nis turned off for solidification of the\nentire bar. After the specimen has\ncooled , the bleedout is stripped from\nthe bar and chemically analyzed to\ndetermine eutectic composition .\nThis technique is effective and\neconomical compared with the conventional zone melting technique or\ncomputational method. This tech-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nTUBE CRUCIBLE\n\nFURNACE\n\nINSULATOR\n\nWATER-COOLED\nRING\nBAR INGOT\n\nA Tube Crucible and Furnace are used to separate a eutectic mixture\nfrom a trial-melt ingot.

This molten\nmetal is collected at the bottom of the crucible, where it is cooled to a\nsolid.\nnique does not require the starting\nmaterial to be close to real eutectic\ncomposition. Indeed, eutectic\nmaterial for analysis (1) has been\nobtained from ingots with as much\nas 60 percent pre-eutectic phase\nand (2) can be obtained in a single\nmelting step. While the computational method is usually limited to\nthree components, this new technique may be used for multicomponent systems.\n\nThis work was done by Young G.\nKim of International Nickel Co. and\nRichard L.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nHEAT PIPE\n\nRHEOSTAT\nB\n\nRHEOSTAT\n\nC\n\nProcedure for Determining Total Carbon In Hydrazlne incorporates a modified pyrolysis train. Liquid hydrazine\nsamples are introduced through the injection port and are mixed with an 02 stream. Three rheostats A, B, and\nC, supply heat at 210 0 , 190 0 , and 105 0 C, respectively. Gas samples pyrolyzed in the furnace at 850 0 + 25 0 C\nare collected by the sample receiver until the receiver pressure reaches 34x104 N/m2 (45 psia). The C02\ncontent in the samples is determined by an infrared method.\nThe most common method of\ndetermining the carbon content in\nhydrazine is through the pyrolysis of\nsamples introduced directly into a\nfurnace. The resulting carbon dioxide is absorbed in barium perchlorate solution , and the amount of CO 2\nis determined by coulometric measurement.\nRecently this method has been\nimproved by using a modified procedure. The samples are vaporized\nbefore they are introduced into the\nfurnace, allowing a safer handling of\nthe highly reactive hydrazine. Vaporization permits larger volume\n\n578\n\nsamples to be introduced into the\nfurnace, which reduces errors related to the sample size. The second\nmodification involves direct collection of pyrolyzed sample gases. This\nreduces losses of CO 2 and allows a\nchoice of analytical techniques to\nmeasure the CO 2 content. Also gas\nsamples can be conveniently stored\nfor future reference .\nThe modified pyrolysis train is\nshown in the illustration. A liquid\nhydrazine sample is introduced\nthrough the injection port , using a\nspecially-cleaned syringe needle.\nThe sample is then mixed with an O2\n\nstream , is vaporized , and fed into\nthe furnace. The pyrolyzed gases\npass through a water trap to the\nsample receiver. Infrared\nspectroscopy can be used to\nanalyze the samples for CO 2\ncontent . The procedu re is repeated\nuntil two consecutive results agree\nwithin 0.1 parts per million of CO 2,\nThe water trap must be changed\nwith every new sample.\nThis work was done by E. E.

They are\ngenerally termed thermosetting\nmaterials as they do not attain maximum utility until converted into rigid,\ninfusible systems by means of crosslinking or curing agents. The types of\ncuring agents for epoxies include\nchemical compounds with hydroxyl\ngroups, carboxylic acid groups, acid\nanhydrides, and various amines and\nammonium groups.\nThe use of diaminodiphenylmethane and diaminobenzophenone\ncompounds containing either one\northo amine group together with a\npara amine group or both amines\nmeta to the diaryl connecting group\n(methylene or carbonyl) leads to\nimproved resin strength , as shown\nby higher lap-shear adhesive specimen tests . For example , the use of\nm, m\'-diaminodiphenylmethane with\na commonly used diglycidyl ether\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Wlnter1976\n\nprecursor gives lap-shear values\nwith aluminum that are at least\n33 percent higher than whim\np,pI-diaminodiphenylmethane is\nused to cure the epoxy.\nThe process for producing cured\nepoxides requires the initial mixing\nof the diamines with the cured\nepoxides by one of three methods:\n-The diamine is melted and stirred\ninto the fluid or melted epoxide\nprepolymer.\n-The diamine is dissolved in a lowboiling solvent, and this solution Is\nstirred into the epoxide. The\nsolvent is permitted to evaporate as\ncompletely as possible within the\npot life or working time of the mixed\ndiamine-epoxide system.\n-Finely powdered diamine is slurried\ninto a liquid epoxide prepolymer.\nWhile good results have been\nobtained using this procedure, it is\nthe least preferred of the three .\nThis improvement in strength, in\ntheory, is the result of the greater\ndegree of disorder or nonlinearity of\nthe diaryl diamine molecule when\nthe two amine groups are arranged\nin the fashion previously described.\nIn addition, the ortho-para and\nmeta-meta dlamine arrangements of\nthese curing agents for epoxides\nprovide the advantage of lower\nmelting characteristics than the\nconventional para-para diamine\nisomers. This lower melting behavior\n\nmakes the mixing of the diamine\ncuring agent with the liquid epoxide\nresin faster and more efficient.\nAnother important advantage\nresulting from the more highly discarded diamines is in the lower glass\ntransition (Tg) , softening, or heat\ndeflection temperatures resulting\nfrom resins cured with these special\ndiamines. The lower the Tg of a\nthermoplastic resin , the greater the\ntoughness of the cured polymer.\nLikewise, in thermoset polymers\nsuch as amine-cured epoxies, the\nsame effect will be manifest in the\nlower softening or heat deflection\ntempe ratu re .\nThis work was done by Vernon L.\nBell and Terry L.

The output signal is used to control electronic or electrochemical currents. An\nelectrolysis cell supplies hydrogen that is carried to the furnace by either a water-saturated carrier gas (e.g .,\nnitrogen or argon) to produce hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, or by carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide for\ncarbon-oxygen-hydrogen mixtures. The output of the cell is used to control the current to the electrolysis cell\nand therefore the amount of hydrogen. Carbon/oxygen flow is controlled by needle valves. Feedback circuitry\ndrives a reversible variable-speed motor test that turns the needle valves. The oxygen fugacity may be fixed by\nusing the null output of a meter and feedback circuitry to maintain a preset EMF automatically. The furnace\nmay also be programed to execute a sequence of oxygen fugacity/time states by comparing the cell output\n(from the meter) with a time-varying EMF signal (from multivoltage sources). The actual redox state of the\nsystem and the rate at which it can be varied are a complex function of system configuration , composition ,\nand temperature.\n\n580\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1976\n\nHowever, some investigations have\nindicated that the gas reactions may\nnot come to equilibrium. Therefore\nthe oxygen fugacities during an\nexperiment may not be the same as\nthose computed for the gaseous\nmixture.\nA system that uses a calciastabilized zirconia-ceramic electrolyte in an oxygen concentration cell\ncan directly measure the oxygen\nfugacity in a vertical-quench furnace, redox-control system (see\nfigure) . The system can independently vary temperature and oxygen\nfugacity during experiments , and it\ncan record these parameters as a\nfunction of time.\nO-rings are used to produce gastight seals against the ceramic, permitting enough slippage to accommodate the differential expansion of\nthe components during heating. The\nsensing head of the electrode and\nthe sample are symmetrically disposed about the axis of the furnace ,\nbut in small-bore systems a coaxial\narrangement is necessary.\nOne leg of a thermocouple is used\nas the reference lead for the cell\n\nbecause it simplifies wiring and\npermits the use of heavier lead wire .\nThe heavier wires and contacts\nextend the cell lifetime. The\nprocess-measuring thermocouple is\ninside the cell and protected from\nthe adverse effects of the furnace\ngas. Due to the isolation from the\nfurnace atmosphere , the system\nmust be carefully calibrated under\nactual process conditions to insure\nthat the measured temperature and\noxygen fugacity are the same as\nthose experienced by the sample.\nThe reference for the cell is provided by an oxygen gas purge in the\ninterior of the cell . Oxygen is vented\nto the laboratory from the base of\nthe cell through the holes carrying\nthe lead wi res out of the cell .

Any volatiles that condense on\nthe cell (water from hydrogencontaining mixtures) will flow to the\nbottom of the furnace, and any leaks\nof reference gas from the cell will be\n\nflushed out of the system without\naffecting the charge .\nThe furnaces employed have hairpin molybdenum disilicide heating\nelements that are less expensive\nthan precious-metal wire, are useful\nto higher process temperatures\n[1 ,848 K (1 ,5750 C)] when\ncompared to platinum-wound\nfurnaces , and have a nominal lifetime in excess of 18 months.\nZirconia-based insulators are\nemployed to make the hightemperature furnaces lightweight\nand rugged .\nThis work was done by Richard J.\nWilliams of Johnson Space Center\nand Oscar Mullins of Lockheed\nElectronics Corp.

The pumping speeds,\ngas loads, and conductances are\nallowed to vary in any prescribed\nmanner. The partial pressure of\neach gas species and the total pressure is computed for each compartment at preset time intervals. The\nMTS was developed primarily for the\nthermal-vacuum envi ronmental\nchambers at the Johnson Space\nCenter, but it should find applications in many industries involving the\nuse of vacuum technology. In particular, MTS would be very applicable\nto simulating pumpdown curves, repressurization, sudden changes of\npressure, and contaminant propagation in compartments, as well as for\nfinding leaks and computing conductances between chambers and\nfinding chamber outgassing required\nto reach a specified ultimate\npressure.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\nIn an isolated vacuum vessel, the\nrate of change of pressure is proportional to the difference of pumping\nspeed and pressure and its outgassing rate . For a system of interconnected compartments the rate of\nchange of pressure involves an\nadditional term to account for the\nflux exchange among compartments. Thus, the system can be\nmodeled by a set of differential\nequations which , in general, are\nnonlinear.

It selects the next functional-logic program step (i.e., programable read-only memory information\naddress) based upon data given by sensor inputs, analog-to-digital conversions, time delays, and randomaccess memory (RAM) status data. The CPU is also constantly on the alert for an interrupt signal generated by\none pf the five critical-priority parameter inputs. Upon receipt of a priority interrupt, the CPU initiates a branch\nin the functional-logic software to a priority service subroutine. The RAM is a 64-bit memory that stores\ninformation concerning system status, and its contents are changed during the course of CWS operation. For\nexample, if the CWS functional logic determines that a sensor has failed, this bit of information is written into\nthe RAM so that the CWS will take into account the failed-sensor status every time the CWS interrogates that\nsensor. This memory gives the CWS the ability to "learn" about CWS status during system operation. The\nRAM can be reinitialized under operator control and will relearn the current CWS status at the time of the\nreinitialization.\nA system consisting of several\nsolid-state logic units linked to\nauditory and visual display devices\nand biomedical instruments is\nemployed as a warning and diagnostic system for a life-support system .\nThe caution and warning system\n(CWS) represents a substantial\nimprovement in sophistication over\nearlier systems . Life-support system\nparameters are continuously monitored . If a malfunction occurs in the\nlife-support system, the CWS will\ndetect and display the out-of-range\n\n588\n\ncondition. Proper corrective procedures and present status are automatically presented to an operator.\nThe system circuit design is\nbased upon a digital, bus-oriented\narchitecture, with its accompanying\nSimplicity, flexibility, and noise\nimmunity advantages. The CWS\nfunctional logic is completely contained within a solid-state, electronic PROM (programable read-only\nmemory). This allows the CWS to be\n100 percent reprogramable; that is,\nits operating functional logic can be\n\ncompletely changed by the substitution of the new PROM\'s for the\nexisting PROM\'s.\nAll CWS functional logic is permanently stored on miniature solidstate electronic-memory integrated\ncircuits, which relieves the operator\nof the responsibility of memorizing\nlife-support system operational\ndetails and eliminates extensive\nchecklists . Tests have demonstrated\nthat specific malfunction procedures\ncan be easily and accurately incorporated into a functioning caution\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nand warning system . By utilizing\nlow-power MOS logic, the power\nconsumption is very low. This is a\ncritical parameter since CWS is\ndesigned to operate from batteries .\nEleven different parameters are\nmonitored for 16 different out-ofrange conditions. Some of the\nparameters are input to the CWS as\nsensor-switch closures , and the\nothers are input as analog voltages\nfrom sensor transducers. The\nparameters are monitored approximately 30 times per second . The\nfirst five parameter conditions are\nassigned a high priority and , if detected , will override lower-order\nparameter malfunctions . Some of\nthe parameters monitored are O 2\nflow, O 2 temperature, vent flow,\nbattery volts , PGA pressure (these\nare the five priority critical parameters), feed water pressure , log\nH p , O 2 pressure temperature ,\n\nbattery current, and others.\nIn addition to the continuous\nparameter monitoring , the operator\ncan , at any time , request a status\ncheck on an additional five system\nparameters . If no status check is\nrequested for a fixed time lapse (10\nminutes in the breadboard system) ,\nthe CWS will remind the operator\nthat a status check is in order by\ndisplaying \' \'STATUS CHECK. " The\noperator may then initiate the check\nprocedure at his discretion .\nCWS outputs include the message\ndisplay as well as two different\nwarning tones . Inputs to the CWS\nare in the form of pushbutton\nswitches for " yes" and " no" responses , a button to request a status\ncheck , and a button to shut off the\nwarning tone . A 16-character,\nalphanumeric , light-emitting diode\ndisplay allows the CWS (0 present\nmessages of up to 16 characters in\n\nlength.

The device has\nno moving parts except for a chart\nrecorder that plots the calibrated\ngraph of spectral intensity vs .\nwavelength .\nFor analysis, a test sample is\ntreated with chemicals that cause\nvarious drugs to become highly\nfluorescent fluorophores . After\ntreatment with these developing\nreagents , the sample is introduced\ninto a chromatographic column (see\nfigure) . The column packing and\ndeveloping solvents used are similar\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nto those used in thin-layer chromatography for the specific compounds\nof interest.

It consists of strainsensing elements sealed in a\nstainless-steel housing that can be\nimplanted in a 3.2-mm hole drilled in\nbone . The housing is threaded externally to provide channels for bone\ngrowth after implantation . In order to\nprovide adequate response, the\nstiffness of the stainless-steel\nhousing is carefully selected so that\nthere is compliance with the bone\nstructure .\nThe strain-sensing elements in the\ntransducer are two silicon semiconductor strain gages bonded with an\nepoxy cement to twin berylliumcopper beams. The strain gages are\nin a half-bridge configuration for\naccurate temperature compensation. The copper beams are shaped\nto deflect in tension or compression,\ndepending upon the axis through\nwhich loads are applied .\nThe electronics package, containing a power supply, a radio-frequency switch, and a transmitter, is\nimplanted in the medial thigh about\n15 to 50 cm from the transducer. A\ncable comprised of three stainlesssteel stranded wires wound in a helix\nand potted in a silicone elastomer to\n\nprovide stress relief connects the\ntransducer to the electronics package ; the cable is buried in a subcutaneous incision .\nThe basic telemetry scheme utilizes pulse interval modulation ,\nwhich is relatively insensitive to\ntemperature variations and nominal\nvariations in the power supply. To\nsample information from each strain\ngage , a multivibrator provides a set\nof discrete pulses that successively\nenergizes each strain gage. The\nmagnitude of voltage change associated with strain determines the\ntime between successive pulses so\nthat the intervals are directly proportional to strain. The pulses modulate\nthe FM carrier wave in the transmitter. Signals are received by a\ntuner, are demodulated, and are\ndisplayed as a dc voltage proportional to strain .\nThe transducer operates over a\nrange of \xc2\xb1 4,000 microstrains and\ncan withstand 6,000 microstrains\nwithout damage . System sensitivity\nis such that 40 microstrains produce\n50 mV at the demodulator output.\nResponse is linear, and frequency\nresponse is flat from dc to about 90\nHz. Noise level has been measured\nto be less than 1 percent of full-scale\ndeflection .\n\nPreliminary calibrations are made\nseveral weeks after implantation.\nFor example , axial loads of up to 60\nkg with frequencies up to 10Hz were\napplied through the tibia of 10-kg\nmonkeys . In that configuration,\nloading in the posterior tibia is predominantly compressive . During\nvigorous physical activity, tibial deformations as high as 1,000 microstrains were measured , corresponding to a stress level of 200 kg . More\ntypically, 200 to 400 microstrains\nare observed . As many as three to\nfive events are measured per\nsecond , with a rise time of about 30\nto 40 ms or 0.01 strain/sec .\nThis work was done by Donald R.\nYoung and Wayne H.

Besides\nthe inherent speed of the luciferaseluciferin technique, considerable\ntime is saved because it is not nec-\n\nessary to isolate particular strains ,\nusing this ATP method . It is sufficient to determine whether a particular antibiotic is generally effective\nagainst the dominant strain present\nin the sample under test.\nFor analYSiS , the fluid is first\nconcentrated by centrifuging , and a\ngrowth medium is added . One\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1976\n\nportion of the test sample is\nprepared for an immediate ATP\nassay to determine whether infection is present at all. A detergent and\nan ATP-ase are added to this sample\nto rupture nonbacterial cells selectively and to hydrolyze any free ATP.\nIn addition , membrane-bound ATP\nmust be released into solution where\nit can be hydrolyzed. This can be\naccomplished by the addition of\nmalic acid.\nThe treated solution is concentrated, and the interfering compounds (especially the ATP-ase) are\nremoved. An extracting agent is\nthen added to rupture the bacterial\ncells and free ATP. This solution ,\nafter preparation, is reacted with a\nluciferase-Iuciferin mixture ; the\nemitted light is measured and correlated with a bacteria count to determine whether sufficient infection\nexists to merit further investigation .\n\nSusceptibility of the dominant\nstrains to various antibiotics is determined by separating three\nportions of the test solution for each\nantibiotic to be examined . A broth is\nadded to the fluid, and it is preincubated to get the organisms into a log\ngrowth phase. To one of the three\nsamples the antibiotic is added. This\nsample and one of the other two are\nplaced in an incubator for about 2.5\nhours . The third sample is immediately assayed for the presence of\nATP, following the general\nprocedures for the initial infection\ndetermination . Upon completion of\nincubatjon, the other two samples\nare similarly assayed.\nThe results from all three samples\ncan be used to determine an ATP\nindex, using the relationship\nATP index\n\n= 8t - Ao\n\nAt-Ao\n\nwhere 8t is the light reading for the\nsample treated with antibiotic (incubation time t) , At is the light reading\nfor the sample not treated with antibiotic (incubation time t), and Ao is\nthe light reading for the sample\nneither treated nor incubated.

This information may enable\na diagnostician to evaluate the depth\nof the burn, thereby providing the\nphysician with an early understanding of its character and leading\nto accelerated treatment.\nThe motivation for photography as\na diagnostic tool is based upon the\nability of various wavelengths of light\nto penetrate different depths into the\nskin and upon the different absorptances of each tissue type at different wavelengths . For instance,\nblood absorbs near-infrared light\nmore strongly than does the surrounding tissue, and infrared photography has had some success in\ndelineating the superficial vascular\npatterns for the diagnosis of diseases that result in morphological\nchanges in the superficial venous\nsystem .

In comparison tests, the\nvalues of indicated mean-effective\npressure (IMEP) obtained by the\nnew instrument were found to be in\nexcellent agreement with values\nobtained by previously existing postrun data-reduction techniques.\nThe instantaneous work performed by the engine is the product\nPeN, where P is the cylinder pressure, and V is the swept-cylinder\nvolume. The integral of PdV for one\ncomplete engine cycle divided by\nthe total swept-cylinder volume is\ncalled the indicated mean-effective\npressure (IMEP) . The IMEP has not\npreviously been available as a realtime measurement, severely limiting\nits potential as an analysis tool and\nprecluding its use as a control\nparameter for optimizing engine\nperformance.\nOne early method of measuring\nIMEP was by directly recording on\npaper a pressure-volume (P-V)\ndiagram by using various mechanicallinkages which-connected the\nrecording pen to the piston and\npressure measuring devices. The\nresulting P-V diagram was then cut\nout and weighed to measure the\nenclosed area. Later developments\nincluded the use of mechanical planimeters for measuring this area,\nthe development of electronic\nvolume transducers, the use of\noscilloscopes to display the P-V\ndiagram in real time, and the use of\ncameras to record the P-V diagram\nfor analysis . More recent efforts\nhave been the use of high-speed\ndigital recorders and computerized\nanalysis.\nDespite the relative sophistication\nof recent techniques, all of these\nmethods involve post-run data\nreduction . Present research at the\n\nLewis Research Center in the areas\nof engine efficiency, fuel economy,\npollutant reduction, and overall\nperformance analysis has necessitated the development of an instrument for the measurement of IMEP\nin real time.\nThe new instrument calculates\nIMEP according to the following\nequation:\n\nSince dV Id8 can be determined\nempirically as a function of 8, it can\nbe stored in the instrument. The\ncalculation is then made by measuring e, obtaining the correct value\nof dV Id8 from the stored information, multiplying this value of dV Ide\nby the instantaneous cylinder\npressure, and computing the summation. The crank angle is measured with an optical shaft encoder\nwhich is connected to the engine\ncrankshaft. The cylinder pressure is\nmeasured with a conventional\npressure transducer.\nThe functional block diagram is\nshown in Figure 1. A more detailed\nblock diagram of the instrument with\ncomponents as built is shown in\nFigure 2. The shaft angle encoder\ngenerates a 1O-bit binary code representing shaft angle in (720/1024)\ndegree increments. The eN Ide\nfunction is stored in a preprogramed\nread-only memory. The binary\nencoder crank angle is used as the\naddress to the memory. The output\nof the memory is a binary digital\nvalue of eN Ide for that value of e.\nThe memory output is multiplied by\n\n4rc\n\nJp(~)de\n\n!PeN=\n8=0\nwhere 8 = engine crank angle.\nIn this form the function eN I de\ncan be determined empirically from\nthe engine geometry and does not\nneed to be calculated in real time.\nThe instrument approximates the\ncontinuous integral by the\nsummation\n1023\n\nL\n\nP\n\n(eN)\n\nde ~e\n8=n~e\n\nn=O\nwhere\n\n~e\n\n4rc\n\n= - - rad\n1024\n\nPRESSURE\nTRANSDUCER\n\n\\,\n\nENGINE\n\nCYLINDER PRESSURE, P\n\ne\n\nI - - SHAFT ANGLE\nENCODER\n\ndV (e)\n\nMEMORY\n\ntcie\n\nMULTIPLIER\n\n~(e)\nde\n\nIMEP\nOUTPUT\nTOTALIZER\n\nFigure 1.

The\npressure and volume data are multiplied in a combination 0/ A converter\nand multiplier. After conversion to a digital Signal, the product is integrated by a summation approximation.

Using the experimental\narrangement shown in the illustration, tunable optical sidebands are\nimpressed on the laser beam . These\nare used to track, in the electrical\nfrequency domain, drifts in the\noptical sideband caused by changes\nin the spacing between the resonator mirrors (thus, changes in the\ndimension of the mirror spacers\nunder test) .\n\nWhen the technique is used to\ndetermine thermal expansion, the\nsample is heated. Changes in the\nelectrical sideband modulation frequency required to maintain peak\ntransmittance through the resonator\nare directly related to the expansion\ncoefficient. However, when the\ntechnique is adapted to longerduration experiments to determine\ndimensional stability over time,\ncomplications arise. Specifically,\nany optical phase shifts that occur\nwith time introduce significant error,\nas they do not cancel out but rather\nadd up.\n\nThis problem is overcome by\nusing parts of Fabry-Perot resonators with unequal lengths as shown\nin the illustration . It is then possible\nto evaluate and correct for these\nphase shifts . A valuable byproduct\nof this new technique is a method of\nmeasuring both the stability of\noptical phase shifts upon reflection\nfrom multilayer stacks and the\ndimensional stability of optical\ncontacts .\nThe use of two resonator cavities\nallows optical-phase-shift data to be\nseparated because, in this experiment, the resonator frequency shifts\ndue !9 volume changes are identical , irrespective of cavity length .\nThus, the difference in the two cavity\nresonance frequencies is related\nonly to nonvolume changes . These\ncan be identified as temporal\nchanges in the optical phase shift\noccurring upon reflection plus the\ndimensional change in the optical\ncontacts that attach the mirrors to\nthe sample spacer under test.\nIn performing the experiment, it is\nnecessary to measure or control\nthermal expansion to within 0 .0020\nC. The optical alinement of the\napparatus must be precise and\nreproducible. With these controls\nand a suitably stable laser, size\nchanges on the order of one part in\n109 are measurable .\n\nThis work was done by J. W.\nBerthold III, S. F.

Consequently, a system consisting of a\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\ncommercial ultrasonic flaw detector\nwith a transducer clamped to the\nspecimen and an x-yyl recorder has\nbeen developed to provide a permanent record of crack extension\nwhich results in a clear indication of\nthe onset of cracking that is relatively insensitive to plastic deformation.\nAcoustic energy in the form of\nhigh frequency waves is transmitted\nfrom the ultrasonic transducer into\nthe test specimen in a direction\n\nnormal to the plane of the starter\nnotch (fatigue crack) . The acoustic\nmismatch at the metal/air interface\nof the fatigue crack causes partial\nreflection of the ultrasonic energy\nimpinging on it. The amount of\nenergy reflected from the crack\nback to the transducer is di rectly\nrelated to the crack surface area,\nthe intenSity of the incident ultrasonic wave , and the tightness of the\ncrack.\n\n605\n\nAPPLIED\nLOAD\n\nw\nZ\n\n0\n>~\n\nW\n\nZ\n\n..:\n::>\na.\n~\n\nUW\n->Z--\'\n00\n\nci w>\n<{\n<{\n\n0\n\n--\'\n\nex:\n>--\'\n::>\n\n\'--------+-----\n\nLOAD DISPLACEMENT . mm\nX-YY \' RECORDER\n\nSchematic of System for Monitoring Crack Extension\nA typical transducer/specimen\narrangement is shown in the sketch.\nThe transducer is used both as a\nsender and receiver. A coupling\nagent such as glycerin, silicone, or\npetroleum lubricant is used to\ntransmit energy across the\ntransducer /specimen interface. The\nsignals received from the crack are\namplified and displayed as a voltage\nspike on the cathode-ray tube in the\ncommercial flaw detector. The\namplitude of the voltage spike, after\npassing through a time gate, is\n\nrecorded on the y-axis of the\nrecorder. Specimen displacement in\nthe loading direction is measured by\nmeans of a piston and cylinder\ndevice which incorporates a standard double-cantilever beam-displacement gage as the transducer.\nThe output is recorded on the x-axis.\nThe applied load is simultaneously ,\nrecorded on the yl scale by utilizing\nthe output from a load cell in the\ntesting machine.\nThe ultrasonic output voltage\nversus load-displacement curve is\n\ngenerally composed of three parts.\nThe portion of the curve from 0 to A\nrepresents a rapid increase in ultrasonic voltage level due to the opening of the fatigue starter crack. The\nsecond stage, from A to B, shows a\nless rapid voltage rise, possibly due\nto plastic deformation. At point B,\nthe curve typically exhibits an abrupt\nincrease in slope indicative of onset\nof crack extension . Further application of load to the specimen causes\nincreased crack extension with a\nproportional increase in ultrasonic\nvoltage output due to the increasing\ncrack area. Onset of crack extension at point B was confirmed metallographically by sectioning selected\nspecimens. Note that crack extension is signaled by the ultrasonic\nvoltage output curve long before any\nindication can be observed on the\nload versus load-displacement curve\n(see dashed line).\nThis system can be potentially\napplied to any material part that\ncontains a starter flaw that might be\nexpected to propagate and form a\nlarger crack.\n\nThis work was done by Stanley J.\nKliman, Douglas M.

The method is\nbased on the measurements of electrical conductivity through a layer of\ndistilled water that has been deposited on the metal surface . Since the\nimpurities are soluble in water, the\nwater conductivity increases, indicating that the metal surface is\ncontaminated .\nMetal samples are tested in an\napparatus as shown in the illustration . A sample is placed inside a\nPlexiglas cell resting on a plastic\nplate . The cell is 5 cm (2 in.) in diameter and has O-rings on top and\nbottom for a tight seal. Next, an\nO-ring-shaped Mylar spacer 0.13\nmm (5 mils) thick is placed on top of\nthe sample . Approximately 0.5 ml of\ndistilled water is added to the\nsample surface, and a stainlesssteel plate is placed on top.

Report I, " Proposed and\nPublished Models," describes the\nvarious possible primary-seal\ngeometries, while Report II, " Theory\nof Response to Angular Misalinement," concentrates on face-seal\nangular-misalinement geometry.\nLiquid-lubricated, radial face\nseals are used successfully in\nmany long-life applications. Common examples are water pump\nseals in automobiles, oil-lubricated\naircraft transmission seals, and\nseals in a host of pumps for\nvarious liquids. The long operating\nlife of many of these seals suggests that the primary-seal faces\n(which are in relative rotational\nmotion) are separated by a\nlubricating film .

These hypotheses include angular misalinement,\nsurface waviness, surface asperities, fluid-film boiling , axial vibration, and local thermal deformation.\nHypothetical seal operating models\nwere devised having secondaryseal friction , primary-ring inertia,\nand primary-ring degrees of\nfreedom that simulate actual seal\noperation . These new seal models\nemploy either angular misalinement, surface waviness, or both\nas the mechanism that generates\nhydrodynamic pressure. Stable\noperation was hypothesized for the\nangular-misalinement models and\nthe surface-waviness models . The\nassumptions that apply to thin-film\nlubrication of seal-like configurations were reviewed for the\npurpose of obtaining governing\nequations that apply to hydrodynamic lubrication of the devised\nnew models. Finally, the theories\nof seal lubrication reported in the\nliterature were reviewed with\nregard to their mechanisms of\nlubrication , their governing equations (and corresponding restrictions), and their conformance to\nthe models of seal-operating\nconfigurations as being representative of actual seal operation .\n\n10 to 500 JAs and has a nominal input\nimpedance of 35 kQ.

The analysis did\nnot impose conditions of constant\ncenterline film thickness or fixed\nrelative face misalinement. Rather,\nin the hypothetical seal model the\nprimary ring is free to respond to\nseal-face misalinement, and as a\nresult of secondary-seal friction the\nprimary-seal surfaces take on\nrelative angular misalinement. This\nmisalinement forms, in effect, a\nconverging and diverging film in\nthe circumfe rential direction.\nPositive hydrodynamic pressure is\ngenerated in the converging portion. An analysis of this seal model\n(which is only one of a number of\npossible seal operating models)\nresulted in a closed-form solution\nthat yields values of film thickness\nwhen secondary-seal friction values\nare known or assumed. A deSign\nexample of an actual seal was\nevaluated by using the derived\nmathematical expressions.\nThe analysis in Report" was\nbased on dynamic response of\nthe primary ring and was developed\nfrom a hydrodynamic viewpoint\nonly; that is, hydrostatic effects\ndue to sealed pressure and seal\nbalance are not included. Thus,\nthe model is most directly\napplicable to a class of seals that\noperate with small or no sealed\npressure, such as in helicopter\nand aircraft accessory gearbox\ntransmissions .

Such calculations are\nmost easily and quickly done by a\ncomputer . One component of\ninterest for small gas turbine\nsystems is the radial-inflow turbine.\nThere has been no readily available\ncomputer program, such as this\nnewly developed program, for performing the velocity-diagram\nanalysis required for determining\ngeometry and estimating performance for radial-inflow turbines.\nInput design requirements are\npower, mass-flow rate, inlet temperature and pressure , and rotative\nspeed . The design variables include\nstator-exit angle , rotor-exit-tip to\nrotor-inlet radius ratio, rotor-exithub to tip radius ratio, and the\nmagnitude and radial distribution of\nrotor-exit tangential velocity. The\nprogram output includes diameters,\ntotal and static efficiencies , and all\nabsolute and relative temperatures ,\npressures , velocities, and flow\nangles at stator inlet, stator exit,\nrotor inlet, and rotor exit.\nAn important part of any turbine\ndesign problem is the estimation of\nlosses. The losses accounted for by\nthe internal loss model are the\nthree-dimensional (profile plus end\nwall) viscous losses in the stator and\nthe rotor, the disk-friction loss on the\n\nback side of the rotor, the loss due\nto the clearance between the rotor\ntip and the outer casing, and the\nexit-velocity loss.\nThe flow analysis is one-dimensional at the stator inlet, stator exit,\nand rotor inlet, each of these calculation stations being at a constant\nradius . At the rotor exit where there\nis a variation in flow-field radius , an\naxisymmetric two-dimensional\nanalysis is made using constant\nheight sectors (maximum of 15\nsectors).

The geometry model for the SRB plume structure considers the plume to be\nconstructed of homogeneous\nregions wherein appropriate values\nof gaseous and particle properties\nare defined . These homogeneous\nregions are stacked along the axis\nand the radius of the axisymmetric\nflow field . Regions are bounded\nalong the radial coordinate by concentric conical surfaces that\nemanate from a common vertex.\n\nThey are bounded along the axial\ncoordinate by planes at right angles\nto the conical-surface axes .\nProperties are defined in a cylindrical coordinate system with its origin\nat the vertex of the cones . Average\nproperties for each region are calculated based on assigned properties at the four corners of each\nregion . Any valid definition of the\nspatial distribution of plume properties may be used as input data.\nTwo SRB plumes are considered\nin the model. The plume locations\nare defined in a central Cartesian\ncoordinate system [X(1) , X(2), X(3)]\ncentered between the dual SRB\nnozzles. The X(1) coordinate is\nparallel to the plume Z axis at zero\ngimbal. The X(2) coordinate passes\nthrough the center of the exit plane\nof the two SRB nozzles, and the X(3)\ncoordinate is at right angles to X(1)\nand X(2). Both plumes are considered to be axisymmetric; the distribution of plume properties along the\naxial and radial coordinates are\napproximated by defining homogeneous regions along the axis and\nradius of the plume. The geometry\nmodel allows the SRB plumes to be\ngimbaled parallel to one another in\nthe yaw and pitch planes or to be\ngimbaled independently with different yaw and pitch gimbal angles.\nThe radiative heat exchange\nbetween surfaces is calculated by\nthe Monte Carlo method, which is\nespecially useful when the geometry\nof the exchange surfaces is complex . The assumption required with\nthe Monte Carlo method is that the\nreflector surface is of some reasonable finite size so that the number of\nbits recorded on the surface will be\nstatistically meaningful. The energy\nbundles are emitted from a surface\nuniformly in a cosine distribution.\nThe process involves picking an\nemission site on the surface and\nchoosing a direction of the trajectory. When a large number of energy\nbundles are dispensed, the emission\nsites will be distributed uniformly\nover the emitter surface, and the\ntrajectory directions will be\ndistributed according to the cosine\nlaw.\n(continued on next page)\n\n618\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter 1976\n\nFORTRAN\nUNIVAC 1100IECEC VIII\nMemory requirements approximately 96K 36-bit words\nThis program was written by W.\ne.

It has been\napplied to the problem of preliminary\nanalysis and parametric evaluations,\nas well as to computing side-edge\nsuction forces for both isolated and\ninteracting planforms.

The\nsituation treated includes vortex\nfilaments which have a streamwise\ncomponent interacting with the net\ndownwash at the filament midpoint\nto produce an elemental side force.\nIn the determination of the total lift\ncoefficient, the additional lift contribution caused by the separated\nflow around the edges is estimated\nby the use of the suction analogy.\nFor planforms having sharp edges,\nthe drag coefficient is represented\nas the experimental value of the\ndrag coefficient when the lift coefficient is zero, plus the total lift coefficient times the tangent of the angle\nof attack. The pitching-moment\ncontribution about the Y-axis\nassociated with the side edge\nsuction force is determined from\neach elemental horseshoe vortex,\napplying the suction analogy locally.\nUpdates to the program provide\nfor more accurate thrust results and\nuser flexibility in choosing the\nleading-edge region of the wing over\nwhich vortex lift is assumed to exist.\nFor reliable side-edge loading\nresults, the program is restricted to\nplanforms which do not have sweptforward leading edges.\nComputations for separated flow\naerodynamic characteristics should\nbe only made for wings without twist\nand/or camber.\n\nFORTRAN\nCDC Run Compiler/6OOO Series\nThis program was written by John\nE.

With this program , multiple\nsurfaces can be designed together\nto yield a trimmed configuration\nwith minimum induced drag at\nsome specified lift coefficient. The\nmethod uses a vortex-lattice and\novercomes previous difficulties\nwith chord-loading specification . A\nTrefftz plane analysis is used to\ndetermine the optimum span loading\nfor minimum drag . The program\nthen solves for the mean camber\nsurface of the wing which will\nprovide the required loading .\nPitching-moment or root-bendingmoment constraints can be\nemployed at the design lift coefficient . Sensitivity studies of\nvortex-lattice arrangements have\nbeen made with this program , and\ncomparisons with other theories\nshow generally good agreement.\nThe program is versatile and has\nbeen applied to isolated wings ,\nwing-canard configurations, a\ntandem wing, and a wing-winglet\nconfiguration .\nThe design procedure is essentially an optimization or\nextremization problem. A Lagrange\nmultiplier technique is used to\nperform the spanwise factor\noptimization including lift and\nmoment constraints on bent lifting\nlines in the Trefftz plane. The\nproblem of determining the\nnecessary circulation matrix is\nsimplified by having the chordwise\nshape of the bound circulation\nremain unchanged across each\nspan, though the chordwise shape\nmay vary from one planform to\nanother. The circulation matrix is\nthen obtained by using the\n\noptimized spanwise scale factors\nwith the spec ified chordwise\nshapes. A chordwise summation\nof the lift and pitch ing-moment is\nutilized in the Trefftz plane solution\nbecause of the assumptions that\nthe trailing wake does not roll up\nand because the general configuration has specifiable chord-loading\nshapes.

It is based\non unified, linear aerodynamic ,\nstructural , and dynamic analytical\nmethods valid for a wide variety of\naircraft configurations .\nLow-frequency dynamics of a\nflexible body are merged with lowfrequency unsteady aerodynamics\nto perform aircraft dynamic stability\nanalysis . Empirical or wind tunnel\ndata can be incorporated to modify\nor replace program computed aerodynamic quantities used in the\nstability analysis . Empirical and\ntheoretical corrections can be\nincorporated in the aerodynamic and\nstability analyses.\n\nAircraft stability and control\nanalysis is performed at prescribed\nflight conditions defined by Mach\nnumber, altitude, angle of bank,\npitch , yaw, and roll rates , and either\nflightpath angle or thrust . Using\nlinear equations of motion , the\ndynamic modes of motion are computed together with the associated\nfrequencies and damping coefficients . If the perturbation equations\nof motion are nonlinear (as a consequence of the user supplying nonlinear aerodynamic data or wanting\nto investigate large perturbations) ,\nor if discrete gust disturbances are\ninput , dynamic stability characteristics are evaluated from timehistory plots. Lifting-pressure distributions on the aircraft can be calculated in the course of the solution\nof the trim problem . Also, structural\nloads, deflections, and rotations are\ncalculated at aerodynamic panel\ncentroids .\nThe FLEXSTAB system can be\nused to calculate either the jig shape\nor design point shape of an elastic\naircraft . The effects of configuration\nchanges , such as planform, camber\nshape, structural elasticity, etc. ,\ncan be evaluated by performing any\nof the above analyses for each configuration change. Present FLEXSTAB capabilities can be extended\nthrough interfacing or linking with\ncomputer programs outside the\nFLEXSTAB system . An example is\ntaking the loads or elastic deflections at the structural grid points\ncalculated by FLEXSTAB and inputting them into the NASTRAN Structural Analysis Computer Program to\ncalculate internal structural stresses\nat specified flight conditions .\nThe FLEXSTAB system is written\nin FORTRAN for CDC 6000 and 7000\nand IBM 360.\nThis program was written by Larry\n\nL.

This system can be\nused to supplement a warm-air\nheating system at a saving to the\nhomeowner of approximately 40\npercent of his annual heating bill. All\nof the required materials, from collector panels and heat exchanger to\npaint and screws, can be purchased\nfor approximately $2,000.

Its chief\nadvantage over existing leveling\nplatforms is its relatively simple construction, which reduces the costs\nof parts and machining.\nThe device consists of an\ninstrument platform secured to a\nshaft that fits within a hollow steel\npipe. Three segments of the shaft\nhave different diameters: The upper\nsection (the upper table) is larger\nthan the steel pipe; the middle\nsection fits tightly within the pipe;\nand the lower section is smaller than\nthe inside diameter of the pipe.\nA nylon tension ring secures the\ninstrument platform to the upper\nsection of the shaft tightly enough to\nprevent relative vertical motion of\nthe two parts. A rotary-adjustment\nscrew allows the instrument platform to be rotated about the shaft\nand then locked into place . The level\nof the platform may be set with two\nlevel-adjustment screws. These are\nset in threads bored through the pipe\nat an angle , and the screws fit into a\ncircumferential groove in the shaft.\nBecause of the tolerance between\nthe lower portion of the shaft and the\npipe, the screws may be used to\nforce horizontal motion on the lower\nshaft. Even though the middle\nsection of the shaft fits tightly within\nthe pipe, the upper end of the pipe\nwill be slightly deformed and acts as\na fulcrum for minor adjustments in\nthe platform level. Also, as both\nscrews are tightened, the shaft is\npulled downward, securing the set\nposition.\n\nThis work was done by Robert w.\nDelaplaine and Daniel L. Mossolani\nof Ames Research Center.

Because it was required that the pumping system not\ncontaminate the sample, all samplecontacting surfaces are made of\nstainless steel or polytetrafluoroethylene . The system uses an existing design for a metallic bellows\npump, and a camshaft assures positive mechanical operation of all intake and exhaust valves.\nThe system is a four-stage compressor consisting of four stainlesssteel bellows, each driven by a\nseparate cam . The reciprocating\naction of each bellows is made positive at all speeds by pivoted connecting links that are directly attached\nto individual eccentric cams . Slide\nguides keep the bellows travel linear\nand unaffected by tangential forces\nfrom the connecting linkages .\nIt was shown by analysis that the\navailable pressure-actuated reed\nvalves were incapable of opening\nand closing at the low pressures\nanticipated . Attempts were made to\nprovide positive reed action by\nmeans of actuators driven by cams\nand connecting rods, but only partial\nsuccess was achieved at low operating speeds . However, positive and\nsmooth valve operation at any\npressure and speed was obtained\nwith cam-driven sliding valves which\nopened and closed ports in synchronization with the intake and compression strokes of a bellows system.

The seal\ngets worn down when the ball rubs\nagainst it and particularly when the\nedges of the hole through the ball\nscrape against it. By mounting the\nball so that it turns eccentrically on\nthe valve stem, much of the rubbing\nand all of the scraping can be eliminated. Thus a ball valve with an\neccentric ball has long life.\nThe figure, which is a section\nthrough the ball perpendicular to the\naxis of rotation (valve stem), illustrates the eccentric-ball-valve\noperation. As the stem is turned\nclockwise to open the valve, the ball\nrotates, and the portion of the ball\nthat contacts the seal moves to the\nright. The seal cannot follow the ball\nvery far to the right because of the\nstop, so the ball moves free of the\nseal before the edge of the hole can\nscrape across the seal. Likewise,\nwhen the valve closes, the ball does\nnot make contact with the seal until\nafter the edge of the hole has passed\nbeyond the seal circle.\nAs the ball continues to rotate to\nthe closed position, friction forces\nact on the two parts of the seal\nshown in the plane of the section .\nThe vertical components of these\nforces try to twist the seal clockwise\nabout its point of support at the\nO-ring , and the horizontal\n\nTEFLON\nRINGS\n\nCENTER\nOF BALL\n\nSPRING\n\nThe Ball Moves Away From the Seal as it is rotated clockwise to open\nthe valve because the axis of rotation does not go through the center of\nthe ball. Therefore the ball does not wear down the seal.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAluminum alloys can be heat\ntreated to vary their properties over\na range of tempers from a soft, TO,\ncondition to the hardest, T8, temper.\nThere is a complex interrelationship\nbetween the temper of the metal and\nits formability. Not only can softer\naluminum be formed into more intricate shapes but the strains resulting\nfrom severe forming place limitations on the degree of hardness to\nwhich a complexly shaped part can\nbe tempered.\nThese restrictions have generally\nprevented the use of aluminum for\ncomplex parts requiring the hardest,\nT8, temper. Yet the weight savings\npossible through the use of the lightweight metal have become even\nmore desirable with today\'s\nemphasis on reducing energy\nrequirements. A cost-effective\nsolution to this problem, recently\ndeveloped for the fabrication of aircraft panels, could allow the lightweight metal to be used for other\nintricate components requiring the\nhardness and stress-corrosion\nresistance of the T8 temper.\nThree basic procedures are\ncombined: (1) mill stock (temper T3)\nis softened by annealing and is\nformed to the desired shape; (2) the\npart is cold worked to bring it back to\nthe T3 condition; and (3) it is artificiallyaged (precipitation heat treatment) to the T8 condition . If the\nseemingly more straightforward\nprocedure of heat treating the part\nfrom the annealed (TO) condition\ndirectly is used; the highest temper\nachievable is T6. This three-step\nprocess allows a controlled amount\nof cold stretching to bring the part to\nthe same condition as the original\nmill stock, from which it may be\nhardened to T8.\nIn the first step, as-clelivered\nsheet is annealed by the customary\nheating, soaking, and cooling to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nCOMPOUND\xc2\xb7CURVED ALUMINUM PART,\nINITIALLY SHAPED IN AN\nANNEALED CONDITION\n\nControlled Cold Forming, after annealing and before precipitation heat\ntreatment, is used to bring a complexly shaped part to the T3 temper.\nThe amount of cold forming is monitored by gridlines added after the\ninitial forming step. The lines greatly facilitate measurement of the\namount of elongation induced.\nreach the TO temper . It is then\nstretch formed to the shape of a prefabricated die. Except for minor\nchanges, the part is in its essentially\nfinal shape at this stage.\nFor the second step, the part is\nsolution heat treated and cooled ,\nputting it in the W temper condition .\nUsing the same die, the part is next\nstretched formed a second time to\ncold work it to a minor extent, to put\nit in the T3 condition . The cold work\ncomprises elongation of 1-1 /2 to 2\npercent. The amount of elongation is\nmonitored by a set of gridlines on the\nsurface of the part (see figure).\nThe final hardening is accomplished by heating the part to an\n\nelevated temperature (less than the\nannealing temperature) and holding\nit there long enough for intermetallic\ncompounds to precipitate at the\ngrain boundaries.

For many applications, however, they remain inferior\nto glass lenses because of problems\nin applying antireflection coatings to\nthe low-melting-point plastic. These\ncoatings improve light transmission\nthrough the lenses by reducing the\namount of reflection at the lens\nsurface.\nThe difficulty in applying a conventional antireflection coating of\nmagnesium fluoride lies in the\nelevated temperature required to\nmake the coating adhere properly to\nthe surface of the lens. Although\nthese temperatures (e.g., 300" to\n500" C) are compatible with glass\nlenses, they severely distort plastic\nlenses.\nNow a very satisfactory anti reflection coating can be applied to\nplastic by the low-temperature\nplasma polymerization of perfluorobutene-2. Using the apparatus\nshown in the figure, the polymer can\nbe formed di rectly on the lens at\ntemperatures around 100" C. The\nlens is fi rst cleaned with solvents\nand is further cleaned and activated\nin an oxygen plasma. It is then\nplaced between the electrodes in the\nreactor chamber, and a vapor of\nmonomer is introduced. Under the\nconditions of the reaction , a plasma\nof the monomer is formed ; this\nplasma then polymerizes on the\nsurface of the activated plastic .\nPerfluorobutene-2 (PFB-2) has\nbeen used as the monomer for\npolymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)\nlenses, but other monomers may be\nmore suitable for different plastics.\nWhen the deposition time is about\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\nLENS\nAND\nHOLDER\n\n-C::::~~~=l--tt--- HOT ELECTRODE\nGROUND\nPLASM A -t1rr\xc2\xb7~::::.::uL2:::\'::":::".1L;;"""J....!-}-I-- ELECTRODE\n\n,.---VOLTAGE PROBE\n\n....\n\n\'\n\n:::~I---~\n\n\' - - -....- - 4 ADJUSTABLE RF\nPOWER SUPPLY\n\nCURRENT PROBE\n\nThe Plasma Polymerization Reactor for coating plastic lenses is an\nevacuated chamber containing a grounded electrode and an electrode\nconnected to an adjustable RF power supply.

This process is essential in\nsprayers for plastic foam , such as\nthe polyurethane used for insulation\nand soundproofing , because the two\ningredients of the foam must be\ncombined just before spraying and\nbecause they must be fully blended\nto insure proper hardening and\nadherence.\nThe mixing chamber of the foamdispersing apparatus shown in the\ndrawing contains an insert that\ncauses the flowing material to divide\nand recombine repeatedly .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA hard, very-smooth metallic film\ncan be strongly bonded to the\nsurface of a plastic such as epoxy\nby using a new electroless plating\ntechnique. The film thickness will\nbe uniform , even over sharp\ncorners and in holes.\nElectroless plating is a means of\ndepositing metal through controlled-autocatalytic chemical\nreduction . Since electrical current\nis not involved in the deposition ,\nthe surfaces of nonconductors\nsuch as plastiCS may be plated by\nseeding the surface with a catalyst.\n646\n\nThe growth of the deposit originates from mUltitudinous point\nsources (catalytic centers) on the\nsurface. On a properly prepared\nsurface, the number of nuclei is\nso large that the growth proceeds\nas a plane front parallel to the\noriginal surface.\nThus electroless plating produces a plate of uniform thickness\nwherever the solution may reach ,\nincluding blind holes and sharp\ncorners that give problems in conventional electroplating . Most of\nthe eleC\'troless nickel alloys contain\n\nphosphorus, which results in a very\nhard plate that is comparable to\nchrome . Hardness and abrasion\nresistance can be increased\nfurther by heat treatment at 750\xc2\xb0F\n(399\xc2\xb0G). The nickel-phosphorus\nalloy has a very low thermal\nconductivity that can be used to\ngreat advantage in models\nexperiencing high surface-temperature gradients.\nThe procedure involves casting\nepoxy into a mold containing a film\nof aluminum powder. When the\nepoxy hardens in the mold, the\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\naluminum powder remains on the\nsurface of the epoxy. The aluminum layer permits good\nadherence of electroless-deposition\nhard alloy, yet excellent fidelity of\nsurface detail is maintained.\nThis method results in a plating\nhaving several useful characteristics:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 uniform plate th ickness rega rdless of the surface contour;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 seamless coating over many\n\nmaterials, including plast ics or\ncombinations of surface\nmaterials;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 abrasion resistance;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 low thermal conducti vity; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 moderate cost and less time for\nfabrication as compared to conventional machining methods.\nThis work was done by Winston D.\nGoodrich of Johnson Space Center\nand Charles J.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nWhen a PC board includes contacts of dissimilar metals, they can\nact as thermocouples and produce\nunwanted EMF\'s in the circuit. The\nproblem beComes significant when\nthe dissimilar metals are sufficiently\nfar apart to be at different temperatures .\nThis situation arose on a computer interface board where lead\njunctions between the copper PC\nboard and a Kovar hybrid amplifier\n(for the signal-input pin and the\nsignal ground pins) were physically\nseparated and at different temperatures . The difference in the thermally generated EMF\'s acted as a\nsignal input and caused the amplifier\nto have a high offset. On the same\nboard a similar problem occurred\nwith reference-diode leads.\nIn this and similar cases , the unwanted signal can be eliminated by\nkeeping the dissimilar metals at the\nsame temperature . One successful\nway of doing this is shown in the\nillustration . The copper-to-Kovar\njunctions are removed from the PC\nboard and are mounted on a beryllia\nsubstrate .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFor many applications, purchased\nstrain-gage terminals are bonded to\na structure, and the jumper and\nmain lead wires are individually cut,\ntinned , and soldered to connect the\nterminals from each gage to instrumentation . Under certain conditions , prefabricating the wire\njumpers and main wire leads at the\nmanufacturing site prior to shipment\ncan reduce strain-gage installation\ntime in the field .\nThe prefabricated terminals\nincorporate copper loops of sufficient length to eliminate the measurement, trimming , and soldering of\nthe individual jumpers. Likewise, the\nmain leads now have crimp connectors already installed to reduce\nthe labor required for terminal-toinstrumentation connections .\nThe bondable terminals used are\n1.4 mil (0 .0035 cm) of electrodeposited copper foil with two\ndifferent types of backing or carrier\nmaterial : Teflon-film backing and\nepoxy-bond laminate .

These are:\nElectroformed Idler Cavity. The\ninner walls of the idler cavity have an\nextremely fine finish (10- 5 cm) and\nare free of seams . These smooth\nsurfaces were produced by electroforming the cavity on a polished aluminum mandrel and then dissolving\nthe aluminum .\nScrew-Tuned Idler. The electroformed idler cavity has no movable\nshort circuit that can be used for\n648\n\ntuning, so a hole is drilled in the\nfixed end wall . The hole forms a\nwaveguide beyond cutoff, which\nprovides a reactance that depends\non its length . Therefore the resonant\nfrequency of the idler cavity can be\nraised or lowered by turning a quartz\nor metal screw in the hole.\nLow-Loss Matching Section.\nThe signal circuit, which houses a\ntransformer for matching to the\nvaractor diode in the parametric\namplifier, is specially designed for\nlow losses . To reduce contact\nresistance , the outer conductor is\nscrewed tightly to the varactor\n\nmount, and the transformer is\nscrewed into a stud connected to the\nvaractor ribbon .\nThe completed parametric amplifier represents a substantial advance in low-noise Ku-band amplifiers .

The technology for this process has been\ndeveloped; the before-and-after\nexample in Figure 1 shows how\nsuccessfully information can be\nrecovered from deteriorated\nrecords .\nAs the first step in generating a\ncleaned-up copy, an electro-optic\nscanner automatically measures the\ndarkness of the original document\n(or of a photograph of the document)\neveryO.OOO01 inch (2 .5><10-5 cm) .\nThe darkness of each tiny area is\ngiven a numerical value from zero\n(pure black) to 255 (pure white), and\nthese numbers are recorded on\nmagnetic tape.

This\ntape can be used to control the\nbrightness of the dots on a TV\nscreen; however, the picture just\nreproduces the original illegible\ndocument with all of its flaws .\nTo remove the flaws from the\nimage, and thus improve the legibilityof the copy, the numerical\nvalues recorded on the tape are\nchanged. One simple procedure is\nto change all of the lighter gray\nlevels to white and all of the darker\ngray levels to black.

The LACI E system can\nhandle data from various imaging\nsensors, including the ERTS/\nLANDSAT satellite (both MSS and\nRBV data) , the MSC 24-channel\nmultispectral scanner, the EREP\nS-192 experiment, and the Michigan\n12-channel scanner, and can be\neasily modified to support additional\nsensors .\nThe primary analysis software\npackages in the LACIE system are\nthe "Pattern Recognition" application, which performs multispectral\nanalysis, and the "Image Registration" application . The Pattern\nRecognition application applies\nstochastic processes to digitized\nmultispectral image data to classify\nunknown data into distinct materials.\n\n653\n\n@\n\nOblique Orthographic\nProjections and Contour\nPlots\nGraphical display reduces cost\nof analysis\nStudies based on mathematical\nmodels of structural configurations\nyield large amounts of output data\nwhich must be comprehensively\nanalyzed. Manual reduction of the\ndata is time consuming and sometimes necessitates reducing only\nthose data associated with particular\nregions of the model. Furthermore,\nerrors in the analyst\'s judgment in\nselectively examining the data can\ncause critical regions to be completelyoverlooked .\nNow two computer programs\nhave been developed to operate\ntogether and graphically display\nanalytical information by oblique\northographic projections and contour plots over large portions of the\nmodel. They allow the analyst to\nassimilate accurately and evaluate\nthe data with a consequent reduction in time and manpower cost.\nGenerally, a three-dimensional\nanalytical model consists of a userprepared set of grid points with given\nspatial coordinates (X, Y, Z) and a\nset of elements (e .g., rod, beam,\ntriangular, or quadrilateral elements) connected at the grid points.\nOblique orthographic projections\nallow a model to be viewed in any\nselected orientation . Euler-angle\ntransformations are used to specify\norientation of the model to be projected. This transformation resolves\nthe coordinate system of the model\nto a principal plane (i.e., viewing\nplane) on which the display is to be\nplotted . In addition to plots of the\nundeformed structure, oblique\northographic plots can be used to\ndisplay the deformed structure by\nadding given displacements to the\ncoordinates of the grid points before\ntransformation and subsequent plotting of elements . Exploded plots may\nbe used to check the topology of an\n\n654\n\nanalytical model when the absence\nor presence of elements in the\nmodel cannot be determined from a\nconventional oblique orthographic\nprojection . Another option specifies\nsectioning or cutting planes to isolate a portion of the model for\ndetailed examination .\nThe contour plotting program is\nused to display the distribution of\ndata over an arbitrary planar\nsurface . The contour surface can\nhave an irregular boundary and cutouts . This generality is provided by\nrepresenting the contour surface as\na series of triangular planes with\ntheir vertexes connected at either\nthe grid points of the model or at its\nelement centroids where the data to\nbe plotted are located . A computationally efficient algorithm which\nuses linear interpolation is used to\ndetermine the location of contour\nlines on each of the triangular\nplanes .\nFORTRAN IV\nCDC 6000 Series\nThis program was written by Gary\nL.

Computer technology has aided\nin the solution of this problem, but at\nthe same time has added the need\nfor specialized computer personnel .\nJPLDIS - JPL Data-Management\nand Information System - has been\ndeveloped to provide all the capabilities of data storage and retrieval\nwithout the need of constant pro-\n\ngramer interface between the\ncomputer and the user.\nThe development of JPLDIS has\nbeen from a user\'s viewpoint. To\ncommunicate with JPLDIS the user\nneeds only some basic concepts of\ncomputer data storage and of the\nuser command language. The user\ncommand language consists of unabbreviated English words so that\nthe user can immediately identify\nand easily associate the word to the\ncomputer operation. JPLDIS allows\nthe user to create files, delete files,\ntransfer all or a portion of a file to\nanother file, save files on tape or as\nelements on an EXEC 8 program file,\npunch data files , transfer JPLDIS\nstructured files to data file records\nsuitable for entry to external\nsystems, sort, merge, or update\ndata file records , append and insert\nrecords from other files, and display\nand modify the structure of a file .\nThere are four types of files incorporated into JPLDIS. They are Data\nfiles, Command files, Form files,\nand Memory files . The Data file\naccommodates structured data\nrecords. A record can be composed\nof character fields (254 characters\nmaximum in each field) and numeric\nfields (12 qigits maximum per field).\nThe numeric fields can be in the\nform of integers, decimals, or scientific notation . The Command file\nconsists of modules containing a\nsequence of command statements.\nThey provide the user with a place to\nsave a set of frequently used command sequences and to execute\nthem at will by entering a single\ncommand . The Form file is used to\nretain the format information required to produce a report. The\nMemory file is used to save certain\nconstants of data values which can\nbe used in subsequent calculations.\nThe JPLDIS can be used to solve\nthe present day business problem of\nrequiring up-to-date information at\n" one\'s fingertips " and , at the same\ntime, reduce operational costs . This\nsystem reduces the time required to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\naccess large data files , reduces the\ncost required to store large amounts\nof data, and solves the problem of\norganizing and updating the files .\nThe system was developed for use\non a UNIVAC 1108 with the EXEC 8\noperating system. Approximately\n20K words of core are requi red for\nthe system . The source code\ncontains FORTRAN (76%) and\nAssembler (24%) .\nThis program was written by Jeb\nJ. Long, Jack N.

The objective of CUAS is\nto apply software technology to\nquestions concerning software performance and quality, which historically have been answered by\ndetailed and laborious manual\nmethods requiring considerable time\nand expense .\nThe typical method proposed and\nimplemented for automating program analysis through software\ntechnology involves source code\nmodification , which may become\nburdensome for the user to apply\nand may impose a considerable primary storage overhead. The technique used by CUAS does not involve source code modification;\ninstead the analysis is performed\ndirectly on the executable code generated by machine collection of the\nsource code . Thus , CUAS has a\nsmall constant primary storage ,\n\nwhich for most application programs\nshould be negligible, and affords the\nuser more information than is possible with a typical source code\nmodification technique . The objective of CUAS is realized by providing\nthe user with reports of subroutine\nusage, program errors , and\nsegment loading which occurred\nduring the execution of the application program .\nThe CUAS consists of a preprocessor , a contingency subroutine, and a postprocessor . The first\nstep in the application of the system\nis for the user to collect his program ,\nincluding the CUAS contingency\nsubroutine. The CUAS preprocessor\nis used to prepare the absolute\nelement such that the jump history\nstack file will be created during\nexecution . Once the execution of the\nuser\'s program is complete, the\nCUAS postprocessor is executed to\nprepare the reports from the jump\nhistory stack file .\nThe external usage report consists of three alphabetically ordered\nlists: (1) every external definition included in the application program ;\n(2) every external definition name\nreferenced by an LMJ instruction\nduring program execution and the\nnumber of references to each; and\n(3) all external definitions not referenced by an LMJ instruction during\nprogram execution . The error location report locates the element\nname, the relative location within\nthe element , and the overlay\nsegment name within which a program error occurred . A walk back ,\nwhich traces the calling sequence\nfrom the main program to the element of the error, is also provided .\nThe segment loading report informs\nthe user how many times each segment of an overlaid program was\ntransferred from secondary storage\ninto primary storage during execution of a segmented and overlaid\nprogram . An itemized report details\nthose subroutines that were called to\nresult in the segment being loaded.\n\nThis program has been implemented on a UNIVAC 11100perating\nunder EXEC VIII . CUAS cannot be\nexpected to execute properly under\nany other machine configuration .\nCUAS has a central memory requirement of from 15K to 20K 36-bit\nwords .\nThis work was done by M. A.\nGoodwin and Pat H. Horsley of\nLockheed Electronics Co., Inc., for\nJohnson Space Center.

This evaluation system\ndoes not duplicate compiler functions, but rather it enhances errordetection capabilities.\nFACES is organized into a driver\nsection with three subsystem components . The main driver is responsible for file manipulations and interpreting user commands . The three\nsubsystem components are: (1) the\nFORTRAN Front End Subsystem\n(FFE) , (2) the Automatic Interrogation Routine (AIR), and (3) the\nReport Generator. The FFE analyzes\nthe submitted source code and constructs tables which characterize\nmodule operation . New modules and\nreferences to other modules are\ninserted in a module Directory for\nsystem use. The source code of a\nsubmitted module is captured in a\nSource Code Catalog file for use in\ngenerating reports . Situations which\nlimit processing effectiveness are\nrecorded on a Flag file .\n\n(oontlnued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1976\n\n655\n\n@\n\nThe second subsystem component the AIR, examines the tables\ngenerated by the FFE for the constructions selected by the user. If\nthe specified constructions are\nfound, diagnostic messages are\nrecorded on the Flag file. The third\nsubsystem component, the Report\nGenerator, combines the contents of\nthe Flag file with the module source\ncode to produce user reports .\nFACES is designed to operate in\nconjunction with a compiler to extend its error-detection capability.\nThe compiler is responsible for\npolicing acceptable constructions\nwhich can be executed; FACES is\nresponsible for analyzing syntax\nwhich is compiler acceptable . The\nFACES system provides analysis\nservices for FORTRAN-based software systems not normally available\nfrom system software. For maximum adaptation to FORTRAN dialects, the code presented to FACES\nis assumed to be compiler acceptable and ANSI FORTRAN IV.\nThe FACES system concentrates\non acceptable FORTRAN code\nfeatures which are likely to produce\nundesirable results . Emphasis is\nplaced on the following areas:\n-Interface integrity among modules\n- Misleading code subject to maintenance problems\n-Keypunch errors likely to escape\nthe compilation process\n-Potentially-malformed execution\nsequences\n-Use of compiler-sensitive code\nThe purpose of FACES analysiS is to\nidentify potential trouble areas\nbefore they become execution-time\nmalfunctions .\nTo implement the system, three\ndisk files are required ; two are of a\nfixed length of 9.6 and 8.0 million\nbytes . The third is of variable length\n(the Flag file) and is controlled by\nJCL statements; 50K bytes maximum should be sufficient. A maximum of 260K bytes of core memory\n\n656\n\nis required for execution of the\nlargest module (the Automatic\nInterrogation Routine) on the IBM\n360/65 . The system operates in\nbatch mode, has been implemented\non the IBM 360/65 Release 21 .8\nwith H compiler, and requires the\nIBM SORT / MERGE package\n(Release 21.6).\nThis program was written by John\nD. Capps and Richard Kleir of\nMarshall Space Flight Center.\nFor further information, Circle ~ on\nthe COSMIC Request Card.\nMFS-23539\n\nTransfer-Function\nParameters\nEstimations using frequencyresponse data\nA computer program has been\nwritten which fits a linear-factored\nform transfer function to given\nfrequency-response data. The\nprogram is based on a conjugategradient search procedure that\nminimizes the error between the\ngiven frequency-response data and\nthe frequency response of a\ntransfer function that is supplied\nby the user. The user-supplied\ntransfer function consists of a\nproduct of terms that can include\na gain, an integrator (or differential), a dead time, multiple firstorder leads and lags, and multiple\nsecond-order leads and lags.\nThe program consists of a main\nprogram called MODEL and two\nsubroutines, CGFM and CFG. The\nMODEL program organizes the\ndata, subroutine CGFM conducts\nthe conjugate-gradient search,\nand subroutine CFG does the\nactual work of computing the index\nof performance and gradient.\nThe procedure for use of the\nprogram consists of entering a\ntable of amplitude and phase-shift\n\nfrequency-response data and a\ntrial, factored form transfer\nfunction ; the user also supplies\nroughly estimated parameter\nvalues such as time constants,\ngains , etc. The computer program\nthen iterates on the supplied parameter values until it has optimized\nthe fit to the experimental data;\nthe excellence of this fit is constrained by the form of the usersupplied transfer function . The\ncomputer output consists of the\noptimized parameter values and a\nnumber indicative of the fit error.\nThe program does not change the\nsigns of the user-supplied parameter values or the given transferfunction structures. The user can\n" build" a transfer function by\ntrying a series of increaSingly\ncomplex transfer-function structures using the fit errors as a guide.\nTo reduce the complexity of a\nhigh-order transfer function that\nmight result from a dynamic\nanalysis, an option is provided in\nthe program for entering the\ncomplex transfer functions in\nfactored form to take the place\nof the normal table of frequencyresponse data. The Simpler model\ncan then be "built" by the usual\nprocedure until it is a reasonable\nfit to the more complex model.\nEfficient computer algorithms\nare used for the calculation of the\nindex of performance and gradient\nand the execution of the search .\nThis results in rapid calculations\nand a small program size suitable\nfor running on a minicomputer.\nFORTRAN IV\nIBM 360-67-TSS\nThis program was written by\nRobert C.

MIRADS was designed\nto be used by people other than\ncomputer or programing professionals . The commands are simple\nto use and flexible enough to meet\nmost data-management requirements.

To\ndate, MIRADS has been used for\npersonnel management, manpower\nanalysis , task management, and\nshuttle payload planning and has a\nmyriad of other potential datamanagement applications.\nThe most important aspects of\nMIRADS are its simplified command\nlanguage and flexibility. Flexibility is\nprovided through various options\nsuch as:\n-Data files structured to 8 levels of\nfile subordination, with each level\ncontaining from 1 to 10 different\nrecord types ,\n-Data security provided at the data\nbase file , record, and field levels,\n-User-formatted output displays and\nreports ,\n-Computing capabilities including\ncounting , summing, exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition , and subtraction ,\n-Saved-query sets with text editing ,\n-Ascending/descending sort\nsequences ,\n-Free format user inquiry language\nwith multiple users of multiple files ,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\n-Response time of 3 to 5 seconds\nfor files of 5,000 records through\nthe use of an inverted list indexing\nscheme .\nUNIVAC 1108, EXEC VIII\nCentral Memory Requirement\nApproximately 32K 36-Bit Words\nBatch Mode or On-Line\nThis program was written by J.

The solution procedure applies to the laminar or turbulent, nonsimilar, multicomponent,\nequilibrium boundary layer for axisymmetric or planar flow and for\ngeneral chemical systems . This program should be applicable in many\nindustries which use processes involving boundary-layer reactions .\nThe prorgam BLIMP (Version J of\nthe Boundary-Layer Integral-Matrix\nProcedure) computes the nonsimilar, chemically reacting laminar or\nturbulent boundary layer for\nablating, transpiration cooled, or\nnonablating internal flow configurations in rocket engine thrust\nchambers . The flow can be\nconsidered to be planar or axisymmetric. The program considers\neither local thermodynamic equilibrium or frozen composition for a\ngeneral propellant gas (no restriction on elemental composition).\nMass addition , either by surface\nablation or injection, for as many as\nthree different materials is permitted . A wide variety of surface\nboundary conditions are available\nranging from assigned wall temperatures and mass injection rates to\nsurface equilibrium while satisfying\na steady-state wall energy balance .\nIn this program the mathematical\nmodel of the boundary layer is derived from the usual turbulent-flow\ntechnique of breaking the species .\nvelOCity, and enthalpy fields into\nmean and fluctuating components ;\ntime averaging ; and making the\nappropriate order of magnitude\napproximations . The results of these\n(continued on next page)\n\n657\n\n@\n\nmanipulations are taken as the departure point for the development of\nall the conservation equations. The\nsolution of the boundary-layer equation is obtained by a novel numerical\ntechnique termed an integral-matrix\napproach that was developed specifically for the solution of\nchemically reacting, nonsimilar,\ncoupled boundary layers.

(See NASA\nTech Briefs B72-1 0736 and\nB72-10721 for descriptions of an\nearlier version of this and a similar\nprogram.) The system was originally\n\n658\n\ndesigned as a general thermal\nanalyzer accepting resistorcapaCitor (RC) network representations of thermal systems, although ,\nwith due attention to units and\nthermally oriented peculiarities,\nSINDA will accept RC networks representing other types of systems\n(e .g., electrical networks) .\nThe SI NDA system consists of two\nmain pieces: the preprocessor and\nthe library. The preprocessor is a\nprogram that accepts problems\nwritten in the SINDA language and\nconverts them to the FORTRAN\nlanguage. The preprocessor also\naccepts programlike logic statements and subroutine calls (requesting some particular routine from the\nlibrary) as data. This permits the\nuser to tailor the program to suit his\nparticular problem . The SINDA\nlibrary consists of many prewritten\nFORTRAN subroutines that perform\na large variety of commonly needed\nactions and reduce the programing\neffort required to solve a given problem . These routines are fully\ncompatible with the FORTRAN routines produced by the preprocessor .\nIt should be recognized that the use\nof a preprocessor provides a system\nwith a large capability and considerable flexibility , but because of the\nnumerous options that are generally\noffered , user instructions are more\ndifficult than other thermal analyzertype programs which have less flexibility.\nAs a thermal analyzer, SINDA can\nhandle such interrelated complex\nphenomena as sublimation , diffuse\nradiation within enclosures , transport delay effects , sensitivity\nanalysis, and thermal network error\ncorrection methods. The thermal\nanalysis is performed on thermal\nanalog modes presented in network\nformat. The network represents a\none-to-one correspondence with\nboth the physical and mathematical\nmodels. SINDA has been used in the\nanalysis of networks containing\n\nabout 2,000 nodes without requiring\nunreasonable amounts of computer\ntime . The thermal network can be\ncoupled to an iterative solution of a\nlumped-parameter fluid network.\nNonlinear material properties and\nboundary conditions may be calculated simultaneously as a function of\none or more independent variables.\nThe general fluid-flow capabilities\ninclude extensive valve characterization and the ability to match pump\ncurves and system pressure-flow\ncharacteristics . The valves have\nbeen formulated so that either\ncooling or heating situations may be\ncontrolled with any of the valve\ntypes . Pump options included are\npressure rise as a tabulated function\nof system flow rate and pressure rise\nas a polynomial function of flow rate.\nSpecial subroutines in SINDA facilitate the thermal analysis of systems\ncontaining counterflow heat\nexchangers , parallel-flow heat exchangers , crossflow heat exchangers , condensing heat exchangers, and any heat exchanger with\nan input effectiveness . The flowhybrid method is incorporated\nfor calculating fluid temperatures ,\nwith improved calculation accuracy\nobtained by using fluid enthalpy\nrather than specific heat for the convective term of the fluid temperature equation . To facilitate the\nspeedy analysis of a general flow\nproblem , provisions have been\nmade for the user to divide the flow\nsystem network into subnetwork elements.\nThe use of SINDA is based on a\nlumped-parameter representation of\na physical system . Thus, SINDA\nsolves numerically a set of ordinary\n(in general nonlinear) differential\nequations that represent the transient behavior of a lumped-parameter system or a set of nonlinear\nalgebraic equations representing\nsteady-state conditions . The\nnumerical techniques used by\n\n....\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , W inter1976\n\nSINDA are based on finite-difference algorithms as opposed to\nfinite-element methods. In problems\ninvolving radiation heat transfer and\ncomplex geometric configurations,\nthe finite-element methods have\nbeen found inappropriate due to\nnonlinearities. For user flexibility,\nSINDA provides a number of\nnumerical solution methods. These\ninclude finite-difference formulations of the explicit methods such\nas :\n- Forward-difference explicit\napproximation,\n- Dufort-Frankel approximation,\n- Exponential approximation, and\n- Alternating-direction approximation;\nand formulations of the implicit\nmethods, such as:\n- Backward-difference implicit\napproximation and\n- Crank-Nicolson approximation.\nUNIVAC 1100 Series, EXEC VIII\nStromberg-Carlson SC 4020 Plotter\nControl Memory Never Exceeds 65K\n36-Bit Words\nThis work was done by\nLawrence C.

It scans user-selected portions\nof the system log file whether\nlocated on tape or mass storage and\nsearches for and processes 1/0\n\nerror (Type 6) entries . The several\ndifferent types of output returned by\nthe analyzer are arranged so as to\nassist the installation manager and\nsystems programers in assessing\nthe system performance , gaging\noverall peripheral activity, and distinguishing marginal media from\nfaulty equipment .\nOutputs\n- Type I output consists of individual\nsummaries of the contents of each\n110 error packet encountered\nduring processing . The entry Information is output sorted by subcodelequipment typelsubsysteml\nunit; multiple errors that are similar\nin all respects (except for time\nstamp) are indicated by fields delineating the times of the first and\nlast of such errors that occurred .\nThe information printed out for\neach entry is as follows : device\ntype mnemonic, subsystem , unit ,\nlOCI MSA number, lOCI MSA\nchannel number, CPU channel\nnumber, EI-status-word(s), external function word(s), time of first/\nlast errors of this type, date, reel\nnumber (pack 10) , total number of\nerrors of this type , and total\nnumber of references since last\nerror.\n- Type II output consists of synoptic\nmatrices (SM \'s), one for each subcode/equipment-type (SCI EO)\npair . Each SM tabulates a number\nof fault/status (F IS) conditions\nwhich occurred for each subsystemlunit (SS/U) pair during the\nanalysis of the user-specified portion of the log file . Each FIS type\ncan be masked out by the user at\nassembly time . The software is designed in such a way that each\nmatrix has a self-compacting feature, i.e., any SS/U for which none\nof the preselected FIS conditions\noccurred will not appear as a row,\nand any FIS condition which did\nnot occur for at least one of the\nSS/U pairs will not appear as a\ncolumn . In addition , row totals\n(number of FIS occurrences for\n\neach SSI U) and column totals\n(number of occurrences of each\nFIS type) are output for each SM .\nThis compactness is particularly\nuseful in keeping the SM\'s of reasonable size when they are to be\noutput on scopes.\n- Type III output consists of a set of\neqUipment-independent statistics,\ne.g., mean-time-to-error, average\nerrors per unit time, average references per unit time , and variance\nof error. For convenience in comparing the performance of similar\ndevices, this information is arranged in separate tables, one for\neach SC/EO pair .\nEach page ofType II and Type III\noutput has a header detailing the\ntime range of the data processed\nand a mnemonic indicating the\nSCI EO of the device, e.g. , U16 for\n7-track UNISERVO 16\'s and F40 for\nFASTRAND-formatted 8440 disk.\nAt the present time, the mechanism exists to provide Type II and\nType III outputs for the following\ntypes of equipment: UNISERVOS\nVIIIC , VIC, VIIICB, VICB, VIIIC9,\nandVIC9; UNISERVOS 12, 16, and\n20 (both 7 and 9 track) ; FH-432 and\nFH-1782 Magnetic Drums ; UNIVAC\n8440 Disk; FASTRAND II and III;\nUNIVAC 8460 Disk; UNIVAC 84141\n842418425 Disk; Type 0716 Card\nReader I Type 0604 Card Punch and\nType 0768 and Type 0770 Printers .\nThe header will also indicate\nwhether the user has elected , by the\nuse of options, to process only u~\xc2\xad\nrecoverable (hard) errors or only\nrecoverable (soft) errors .\nInputs\n- Option Letters - By using option\nletters, the user can elect to not\nuse the run-I. D. or reel number\nwhen creating Type I packets (\' I\'\nandlor \'J\' options) , to restrict\nprocessing to unrecoverable or recoverable errors only (\'U \' or \'R\'\noptions) , to print only Type II and\nType III output (\'S\' option), to\nprocess the log file from tape\n\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs , Winter 1976\n\n659\n\nrather than from mass storage (T\noption), and to print out detailed\ninformation about the assignment\nand deassignment of F-Cycles or\nlog tapes during processing (\'Z \'\noption) .\n- Key-ins (Data Cards) - Three keyins are currently implemented :\n(1) The " time range " key-in allows\nthe user to specify a "start time "\nand a " stop time " within which the\nsearch for Type 6 entries is to take\nplace; (2) the " subsystem/unit "\n\n660\n\nkey-in enables the user to restrict\ninvestigations to a particular set of\nsubsystems or subsystem/unit\npairs ; and (3) the " equipment\ntype " key-in allows the user to confine processing to a particular\ngroup of peripherals .\nThe " subsystem/unit " and\n" equipment type " key-ins , when\nused together , operate in an inclusive-or mode . These key-ins are\nparticularly useful in conjunction\nwith the " T" key-in when all types of\n\noutput (Types I, II , and III) are to be\nscrutinized for a suspected faulty\nperipheral . Output of Type I for the\nentire configuration in such an\ninstance would be relatively voluminous and wasteful .\nThis program was written by\n\nEdwin T. Vaughan of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.
