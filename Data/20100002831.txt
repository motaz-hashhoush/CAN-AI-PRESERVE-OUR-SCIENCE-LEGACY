b'Manufacturing &\nPrototyping\nFabrication of Buried\nNanochannels From Nanowire Patterns\nSacrificial nanowires are buried, then etched away to form buried channels.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method of fabricating channels having widths of tens of nanometers in silicon substrates and burying the channels\nunder overlying layers of dielectric materials has been demonstrated. With further refinement, the method might be\nuseful for fabricating nanochannels for\nmanipulation and analysis of large biomolecules at single-molecule resolution.\nUnlike in prior methods, burying the\nchannels does not involve bonding of\nflat wafers to the silicon substrates to\ncover exposed channels in the substrates. Instead, the formation and burying of the channels are accomplished in\na more sophisticated process that is less\nvulnerable to defects in the substrates\nand less likely to result in clogging of, or\nleakage from, the channels.\nIn this method, the first step is to establish the channel pattern by forming\nan array of sacrificial metal nanowires on\nan SiO2-on-Si substrate. In particular, the\nwire pattern is made by use of focusedion-beam (FIB) lithography and a subsequent metallization/lift-off process. The\npattern of metal nanowires is then transferred onto the SiO2 layer by reactive-ion\netching, which yields sacrificial SiO2\nnanowires covered by metal. After re-\n\nmoval of the metal covering the SiO2\nnanowires, what remains are SiO2\nnanowires on an Si substrate.\nPlasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) is used to form a layer\nof a dielectric material over the Si substrate and over the SiO2 wires on the surface of the substrate. FIB milling is then\nperformed to form trenches at both\nends of each SiO2 wire. The trenches\nserve as openings for the entry of chem-\n\nPECVD dielectrics\n\nSiO2 nanowire\n\nThis Scanning Electron Micrograph shows a cross\nsection of a 20-by-80-nm channel formed between a silicon substrate and an overlying layer\nof dielectric material.\n\nicals that etch SiO2 much faster than\nthey etch Si. Provided that the\nnanowires are not so long that the diffusion of the etching chemicals is blocked,\nthe sacrificial SiO2 nanowires become\netched out from between the dielectric\nmaterial and the Si substrate, leaving\nburied channels. At the time of reporting the information for this article,\nchannels 3 \xce\xbcm long, 20 nm deep, and 80\nnm wide (see figure) had been fabricated by this method.\nThis work was done by Daniel Choi and EuiHyeok-Yang of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Diamond machining (including finishing)\nis often used, for example, in fabrication\nof precise metal mirrors.\nA diamond smoothing tool according\nto the proposal would have a smooth\nspherical surface. For a given finish machining operation, the smoothing tool\nwould be mounted next to the cutting\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, July 2007\n\ntool. The smoothing tool would slide\non the machined surface left behind\nby the cutting tool, plastically deforming the surface material and thereby\nreducing the roughness of the surface,\nclosing microcracks and otherwise\ngenerally reducing or eliminating microscopic surface and subsurface defects, and increasing the microhardness\nof the surface layer. It has been estimated that if smoothing tools of this\ntype were used in conjunction with cut-\n\nting tools on sufficiently precise lathes,\nit would be possible to reduce the\nroughness of machined surfaces to as\nlittle as 3 nm.\nA tool according to the proposal\nwould consist of a smoothing insert in a\nmetal holder. The smoothing insert\nwould be made from a diamond/metal\nfunctionally graded composite rod preform, which, in turn, would be made by\nsintering together a bulk single-crystal\nor polycrystalline diamond, a diamond\n\n17\n\npowder, and a metallic alloy at high\npressure. To form the spherical smoothing tip, the diamond end of the preform would be subjected to flat grinding, conical grinding, spherical\ngrinding using diamond wheels, and finally spherical polishing and/or buffing using diamond powders. If the dia-\n\n18\n\nmond were a single crystal, then it\nwould be crystallographically oriented,\nrelative to the machining motion, to\nminimize its wear and maximize its\nhardness.\nSpherically polished diamonds could\nalso be useful for purposes other than\nsmoothing in finish machining: They\n\nwould likely also be suitable for use as\nheat-resistant, wear-resistant, unlubricated sliding-fit bearing inserts.\nThis work was done by Oleg Voronov of\nDiamond Materials, Inc. for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.
