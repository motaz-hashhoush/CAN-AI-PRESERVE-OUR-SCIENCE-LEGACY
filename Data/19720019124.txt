Those weighted values without an\nasterisk were assigned by the Skylab Program Office at the Manned\nSpacecraft Center (MSC) pending receipt of official values from\nPrincipal Investigators. Functional Objectives with asterisks\nwere assigned by the Principal Investigators.\n\nB.\n\nThe data requirements section of the DTO\'s has been eliminated.\nA summary of the Data Request Forms (DRF\'s) has been published\nunder separate cover as Appendix A to the MRD.\n\nC.\n\nATM requirements are not included in this document because a complete revision of the ATM section of this document is currently\nin preparation.\n\nD. The earth resources DTO\'s have been prepared with the best available data. At this time, only the EREP hardware performance\nverification DTO\'s have been defined and appear in Section 3.2.3.\nDetailed test objectives related to EREP applications investigations will be prepared for subsequent issues of the MRD.\nE.\n\nThe lunar topographic camera used on Apollo has been approved for\nimplementation on Skylab as part of the earth resources experiments. The camera assembly has been designated the Earth Terrain\nCamera (ETC) and will be operated as part of the Multispectral\nPhotographic Facility (S190). Experiment S190 has been divided\ninto two parts: S190A Multispectral Photographic Cameras (MPC)\nand S190B Earth Terrain Camera (ETC). Detailed test objectives\nrelated to the ETC will be prepared for subsequent issues of the\nMRD.\n\nF.\n\nThe August 1, 1971 issue of the SL-3 MRD and the September\n27, 1971 issue of the Skylab Flight Plan both reflected the\ncompletion of astronaut maneuvering runs for the M509\n(Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment) and T020 (Foot Controlled\nManeuvering Unit) experiments on the SL-3 mission. Since\nA\n\nthe above scheduling would result in SWS overpressurization\nwith gaseous nitrogen from the experiments and exceeding\nmedical limits on the lower partial pressure for oxygen in\nthe SWS atmosphere, a study was conducted and a decision made\nto reschedule four M509 and five T020 maneuvering runs from\nSL-3 to SL-4. The reduced number of runs for both experiments for SL-3 are reflected in this issue of the SL-3 MRD.\nG.\n\nExperiment M516 (Crew Activities/Maintenance) has been approved\nby NASA/ML for the Skylab Program. This experiment requires no\nunique or additional equipment. Data for M516 evaluation will\nbe provided by film (three 400-foot magazines), TV, spacecraft\ntelemetry, and recorded subjective evaluations and comments of\ncrew activities. A DTO will be included in the MRD when additional information is available.\n\nH.\n\nThe first issue of the combined DTO for Experiments T027 and S073\nincluded in this document is presently undergoing extensive\nrevision. Upon approval, the revised DTO for T027/S073 will be\nissued as a change to this document.\n\nI.\n\nExperiment T031 (Spacecraft Surfaces) has been given contingency\napproval by the MSFEB for assignment to the Skylab Program pending completion of a formal compatability study by the Skylab\nProgram Office. A DTO will be developed for this experiment and\nincorporated in the MRD upon final approval.\nBased upon inputs from the NASA Headquarters, the Program Offices\nare in the process of re-examining the success criteria for Detailed Test Objectives for all Skylab missions. Efforts are now\nunderway to obtain statements of the PI\'s minimum essential requirements to satisfy his experiment. These data are primarily\nintended for real time flight planning. It is the desire and\nintent of the Program Offices to schedule all approved PI requirements that are feasible in the pre-mission flight plan;\nhowever, if problems or anomalies are encountered, it may become\nnecessary to reduce and/or delete some experiments or parts of\nexperiments. The success criteria would be used to gauge whether\nan experiment could be minimally successfully completed under\nthese adverse circumstances or whether it should be discontinued.\nProgram Office personnel will work with the PI\'s to determine\nthese criteria.\n\nJ.\n\nB\n\nI-MRD-OO1E\nVOLUME II\n\nMISSION REQUIREMENTS\n\nSECOND SKYLAB MISSION\nSL-3\n\nFebruary 1, 1972\n\nSKYLAB PROGRAM OFFICES\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\nMANNED SPACECRAFT CENTER\nAND\nMARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER\n\nApproved By\nd\n\nc\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n.

Mission objectives are the ends\ntoward which efforts are directed for each mission.\nMission objectives are specified by the OMSF.\n* Experiments. Experiments are planned investigations\nwhich are conducted in flight during manned space\nmissions, or which are essentially connected with\nthe in-flight situation. These investigations, which\nare approved by the Manned Space Flight Experiments\nBoard and assigned by the Headquarters Program Office\n(ML), are conducted to obtain research information\nwhich can contribute to the advancement of science\nand technology.\n* In-flight System Tests. In-flight system tests are\nthose tests which are conducted to evaluate the performance of a particular system or subsystem to\ndetermine its suitability on future Skylab missions.\n* In-flight Operational Tests. In-flight operational\ntests are those tests involving operational techniques\nor procedures which are conducted to determine the\nmethod of operating systems or subsystems to obtain\noptimum results.\n* Extravehicular Activity. Activity performed in space\nor on a celestial body by an astronaut external to the\nspace vehicle.\n* Intravehicular Activity. Activity with one or more of\nthe adverse characteristics of EVA because of reduced\ngravity and/or pressurized space suit, performed in\nspace or on a celestial body by an astronaut internal\nto the space vehicle.\n\xc2\xb7 Primary Mission. The primary mission is a planned\nmission that satisfies a prescribed set of objectives\nand requirements as defined by the Operations Directives.\ne Backup Mission. A backup mission is a preplanned\nmission flown in place of the primary mission when\nthe decision to change is made prior to CSM launch.\n* Alternate Mission. An alternate mission is a preplanned mission flown in place of the primary mission\nwhen the decision to change is made after CSM launch.\n* Detailed Test Objective. Scientific, engineering,\nor operational objectives which amplify mission\nobjectives or detail a major development purpose or\nfeature of the mission. The accomplishment of a\nDetailed Test Objective will be an important consideration in determining the degree of achievement\nof the mission objective(s).\nxix\n\nt/OrB\n\n_62le\n\n1.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.1\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe Skylab (SL) Program objectives are to extend the duration of\nmanned space flight and to carry out a broad spectrum of experimental\ninvestigations. Of particular importance are a series of medical experiments associated with the extension of manned space flight, a series of\nhigh resolution solar astronomy experiments at the short wavelengths not\ndirectly observable from the surface of the earth and a series of earth\nsurvey experiments.\nThe Skylab missions are designed to support these objectives. Currently, the program includes three low earth orbit missions, designated\nSL-1/SL-2, SL-3 and SL-4. This volume contains mission requirements for\nthe second Skylab Mission (SL-3) only. The Skylab SL-1/SL-2 Mission Requirements are contained in Volume 1 of the Mission Requirements Document\n(MRD). The SL-4 Mission Requirements are contained in Volume III of\nthe MRD. Summaries of the Data Request Forms (DRF\'s) associated with Skylab\nDetailed Test Objectives are contained in Appendix A of the MRD.\nThe SL-3 mission will utilize an orbiting Saturn WorkshoD (SWS). The\nSWS configuration includes a Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA), Apollo\nTelescope Mount (ATM), Airlock Module (AM), and an S-IVB Stage (modified\nas an Orbital Workshop [OWS]), previously launched and inserted into orbit\non a two-stage Saturn V Launch Vehicle for the SL-1/SL-2 mission. The\nSL-3 configuration will be a manned Command Service Module (CSM) launched\non a Saturn IB Launch Vehicle. The SL-3 CSM will rendezvous and dock with\nthe SWS forming an Orbital Assembly (OA) to accomplish a long duration\nmission of up to 56 days.\n1.2 SCOPE AND PRECEDENCE\nThe MRD is prepared in accordance with NASA Headquarters, Office of\nManned Space Flight (OMSF) directives and Skylab specification documents\nas listed in NASA Headquarters Program Directive No. 43A, M-D ML 3200.125,\ndated March 26, 1971 and Cluster Requirements Specification No. RS003MOO003,\ndated August 8, 1969, References 1 and 2 respectively. It defines the\nmission requirements and the functional and performance requirements for\nimplementing the program and mission objectives specified therein. The\nMission Assignments and Flight Scheduling Precedence Numbers for the experiments were assigned by OMSF, NASA Headquarters Program Directive No.\n43A, Reference No. 1. The scope of this document is the definition of\nmission operational requirements for mission SL-3.\nThe MRD shall provide the basis for mission planning and design by\nall elements of the Skylab Program. In the event of conflict between\nthe MRD and other mission planning documentation, the MRD shall govern\nwith respect to mission objectives and requirements.\nThe relationship of the MRD with other program documentation is depicted in Figure 1-1, Skylab Program Specification Tree. Performance and\ndesign requirements for cluster systems to implement mission requirements\nare contained in the Cluster Requirements Specification (Reference 2).\n\n1-1\n\nMany subsidiary mission documents must be prepared to implement the\nrequirements of this MRD. These documents may expand on, but must not\nconflict with the contents of the MRD.\n1.3 PUBLICATION AND REVISIONS\n1.3.1 Publication\nDevelopment of the MRD is the joint responsibility of the Skylab\nProgram Offices at the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) and the Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC). Preparation and coordination of this document will be performed under the cognizance of the Mission Requirements\nPanel with approval and sign-off by both program managers.\n1.3.2 Revisions\nThe document will be revised as required to provide necessary guidelines for supporting activities. All revisions will be handled in the\nsame manner as the basic document and will require joint sign-off by the\nSkylab Program managers at both the MSC and MSFC.\nRequests for changes to the document shall be submitted to either of\nthe Co-chairmen, Mission Requirements Subpanel (P. H. Allen, MSC/KM;\nJ. W. Thomas, MSFC/PM-SL-EI).\n\n1-2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPROGRAM\n_\nSPEC\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nDIRECTIVE\n\nE\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nERD\'S\n\nI\n\nMRD\n\nTRAJ PLAN\nFLT PLAN\nMSN RULES\n\nFigure 1-1.\n\nSkylab Program Specification Tree\n\n1-3\n\n2.0 SKYLAB MISSION SL-3\n2.1\n\nMISSION DEFINITION\nSkylab Mission SL-3 will be the second in a series of missions\nwhich are designed to achieve long duration space flights of men and\nsystems and to perform scientific investigations in earth orbit. The\nSkylab mission phases and major events are illustrated in Figure 2-1. The\nSL-3 mission will consist of one manned CSM launch, rendezvous and docking\nwith the orbiting SWS, and operation of both modules as an OA for up to 56\ndays to accomplish the mission objectives. The SWS will then be prepared\nfor unmanned operations and the CSM will deorbit for recovery.\nThe unmanned phase of Skylab Mission SL-3 will begin when the SL-2 CSM\nand crew separate from the SWS just prior to reentry. The unmanned portion\nof the mission will continue until the SL-3 CSM and crew are launched to\nrendezvous and dock with the SWS. The manned phase of Skylab Mission SL-3\nwill terminate with recovery of the SL-3 CM and crew. Unmanned SWS operations after separation of the SL-3 CSM will be included as part of the\nSL-4 mission.\n2.2 MISSION OBJECTIVES\nThe objectives for the SL-3 mission, as assigned by the OMSF, NASA\nHeadquarters Program Directive No. 43A (Reference 1), are as follows:\n2.2.1 Perform Unmanned Saturn Workshop Operations\n(a) Obtain data for evaluating the performance of the unmanned\nSWS.\n(b) Obtain solar astronomy data by unmanned ATM observations.\n2.2.2 Reactivate the Skylab Orbital Assembly in Earth Orbit\n(a) Operate the orbital assembly (SWS plus CSM) as a habitable\nspace structure for up to 56 days after the SL-3 launch.\n(b) Obtain data for evaluating the performance of the orbital\nassembly.\n(c) Obtain data for evaluating crew mobility and work capability\nin both intravehicular and extravehicular activity.\n2.2.3 Obtain Medical Data on the Crew for Use in Extending the Duration\nof Manned Space Flights\n(a) Obtain medical data for determining the effects on the crew\nwhich result from a space flight of up to 56 days duration.\n(b) Obtain medical data for determining if a subsequent Skylab\nmission of greater than 56 days duration is feasible and\nadvisable.\n2.2.4 -Perform In-Flight Experiments\n(a) Obtain ATM solar astronomy data for continuing and extending\nsolar studies beyond the limits of earth-based observations.\n(b) Obtain earth resources data for continuing and extending\nmultisensor observation of the earth from the low earth orbit.\n(c) Perform the assigned scientific, engineering, technology and\nDOD experiments.\n2-1\n\nHocVNn\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_-\n\n-\n\n7-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n0\n\n--\n\n(,\n4~\n\n??~~~~~~~~\n\na)\n,)\n\nLJ\n\n0\n\nto\n\nzrr.----\n\nMA3AOi3B\nAI)OGNN\n\nc,\n\na)\n\nU,\n\nO\n\n0\n\n-\n\n9\n\nHDNnV1\n\n=\n\nr-:=_--\n\nc-S- -\n\nz\n\nR0\n\na\n\nCM\n\nz\n._\nL\'I\n\nAMAOD3\n) OONN1----.)VoaN1 ---\n\n=\n\nz\n>-\n\n0q-2\n\n<\n\n4,\nz^\n\nHDNnvl -15HMNnV\n1--5s\n\n2-2\n\n2.3 MISSION REQUIREMENTS\n2.3.1 Mission Profile Requirements\n2.3.1.1 Launch Date\nMission planning shall be based upon a launch readiness date for SL-3\nwithin 90 (+6) days after the launch of SL-2.\n2.3.1.2 Launch Planning\nSL-3 shall not be launched until the SWS systems are judged to be\noperating in accordance with the criteria presented in Section 2.3.3.\nMission planning shall optimize selection of launch opportunities\nwhich will provide an "early rendezvous" (i.e., M = 5-8) capability and\nshall be based on a maximum of 700 pounds of SL-3 launch vehicle payload\ndecrement for yaw steering. The basis for the "early rendezvous" requirement is the necessity for crew access to the SWS urine freezer within 24\nhours of CSM launch to preserve urine samples.\n2.3.1.3 Launch Complexes\nSL-3 will be launched from Complex 39B at Kennedy Space Center (KSC).\n2.3.1.4 Insertion Altitudes\nThe SWS will have been previously inserted into a circular orbit of\napproximately 235 n mi measured above the mean equatorial reference radius.\nThe SL-3 CSM will be inserted into an 81 by 120-n mi orbit (measured\nabove the mean equatorial reference radius) by a Saturn IB Launch Vehicle.\nCSM RCS and SWS TACS shall be used to perform orbit trim maneuvers\nfor the purpose of providing controlled repeating orbits for Earth Resources\nexperiments. Where practicable, the method utilized shall be selected to\nminimize contamination to the OA.\n2.3.1.5 Orbital Inclination\nMission planning shall be based on a northerly launch azimuth.\nThe SL-3 CSM will be targeted for rendezvous with the SWS orbiting\nat a planned orbital inclination of 50 degrees.\n2.3.1.6 Rendezvous and Docking\nThe SL-3 CSM will rendezvous with the SWS and will dock to the primary\n(axial) docking port. Launch time of day shall be optimized to obtain proper lighting in the recovery areas, provide early rendezvous for SL-3,\nallow approximately 90-day intervals between the manned launches, obtain\nsufficient deorbit tracking coverage, and to provide (as much as possible)\nproper lighting and tracking coverage for abort situations. The CSM VHF\nranging system will be required from a maximum distance of 300 n mi to a\nminimum distance of 500 feet. The SWS attitude will be such to enhance\nVHF angular ranging requirements for CSM/SWS rendezvous. The SWS shall\ninitiate the rendezvous pointing attitude (Z-LV[R]) rendezvous mode, with\nthe -X axis in the direction of the velocity vector, as early in a given\norbit as orbital midnight and return to the solar inertial mode at orbital\nmidnight after a maximum of two orbits. The Z-LV(R) attitude shall be\nmaintained within 12 degrees about the Y axis and within 6 degrees about\n2-3\n\nthe X and Z axes. The maximum excursion in attitude shall not occur until\nthe end of the second orbit period. The rendezvous mode may occur at beta\nangles up to +73 1/2 degrees. At beta angles greater than 50 degrees, the\nSWS shall be biased about the X axis to a maximum of 23 1/2 degrees from\nthe Z-LV(R) attitude.\nOperational planning shall insure that the SWS Attitude and Pointing\nControl System (APCS) gain changes from the unmanned configuration to the\nCSM docked configuration are implemented within one orbit after CSM docking. Gain changes required to reconfigure the APCS for the unmanned mode\nshall be made prior to CSM undocking.\n2.3.1.7 Orbital Attitudes\nThe attitude requirements for the Saturn Workshop are as follows:\na) Prior to CSM rendezvous - Solar inertial attitude (X-IOP/Z)\n(Note 1)\nb) CSM rendezvous - Z-LV(R) (See Section 2.3.1.6)\nc)\nd)\n\nCSM docking - X-IOP/Z\nWorkshop operations - X-IOP/Z\n\ne)\nf)\n\nEarth pointing experiment operations - Earth pointing attitude\n(Z-LV[E]) (Note 2)\nInertial Measurement Unit alignment - X-IOP/Z\n\ng)\nh)\n\nCSM undocking - X-IOP/Z\nSWS storage - X-IOP/Z\n\nNotes:\n1. X-IOP/Z: The solar inertial attitude is defined as the principal OA\nX axis in the orbital plane with the Z axis coincident with the sun line.\nThe -Z axis points directly toward the sun and, at orbital noon, the +X\naxis is in the direction of the velocity vector. (The OA coordinate system\nis illustrated in Figure 2-2.) The X-IOP/Z mode includes Control Moment\nGyro (CMG) desaturation maneuvers performed each orbit on the "night" side\nof the orbit.\n2. Z-LV(E): The earth pointing attitude is defined as the OA geometric\nX axis in the orbital plane with the Z axis along the geodetic local vertical. The +Z axis points directly toward the earth and the +X axis is\nin the direction of the velocity vector (i.e., CSM leading).\n2.3.1.8 Mission Duration\nThe SL-3 mission duration shall be planned for 56 days from the\nlaunch of the SL-3 CSM.\n2.3.1.9 Recovery Zones\nIt is highly desirable that the mission be planned such that nominal\nrecovery occurs during daylight. All planned landing areas shall be in\nwater.\n\n2-4\n\n.\n\n0\n\n+\n\nE\nai\n4)\n\n0\n\nS)\n\nc\n\nO\nro\n\n4-\n\n0\nO\nx\n\n< U\n>-\n\n:\n\nC)\n\nE\n\nZ r\n\n:\n\n4\')\n\n0\n\nOv,\n\n<UO o(,\nc\n\nr-\n\nO\n0\n\n.0\n\n0\n\n10\n\nexU\no\n\nI\n\nL0\n\nz\n\nL\n\nu\n\nLU\n\n*\n\nId\n\n-J Z\n\nOc\nV} \xc2\xb0 >-\n\nO\n\n0-\n\nz\n\n+\n\n0 \xc2\xabw\n\nX\n\nV) Lu t A\n\nOv,\n\na)\n\n~ON>\n\n-00\n0\nCL\n\ncu\n\n>I\n\nLL\n\nU\nI\n\n:(\nU\n\nN\n\nI\n\n<I\n\no\n\n0\nC")\nLU\n\n2-5\n\nC3~oi\n\n>u-C\n\ni;\no\n\n2.3.2 Operations Requirements\n2.3.2.1 Extravehicular Activity\nThree extravehicular activity periods are planned for this mission.\nThe EVA\'s shall be through the AM EVA hatch. The capability shall exist\nto perform EVA operations during both daylight and dark periods of the\norbit. Each planned operation shall be limited to three hours of actual\nEVA time. Two crewmen shall be capable of EVA during the period.\n2.3.2.2 Rendezvous Lighting\nFlashing lights on the SWS shall be used during CSM rendezvous for:\n(a) acquisition and tracking\'with the Command Module (CM)"sextant to update the CSM state vector prior to rendezvous maneuvers; and (b) tracking\nwith the Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (COAS) prior to terminal phase\ninitiation (TPI). The lights shall provide continuous coverage through\nthe sextant for a maximum range of\'300 n mi during darkness.\n2.3.2.3 CSM On-Orbit Verification\nPeriodic operation/monitoring of the CSM will be required to ensure\na satisfactory deorbit capability.\n2.3.2.4 Deorbit Capability\nThe SM Service Propulsion System (SPS) shall provide the primary deorbit capability for the SL-3 CSM. The RCS shall provide a backup deorbit\ncapability.\n2.3.2.5 CMG Desaturation\nThe CMG desaturation will be automatic (with inhibit capability by\nthe crew or Digital Command System command) and will occur during the\n"night" portion of the orbit (typically about 35 percent of the orbit is\nrequired for CMG desaturation).\n2.3.2.6 Venting and Dumping\nDuring ATM and Earth Resources Experiments Package (EREP) experiment\noperations, all controllable OA venting and dumping will be planned to\noccur early during the "night" portion of the orbit.\n2.3.2.7 Orbital Assembly Attitude Control and Experiment Pointing\nAny OA attitude control shall be performed using either the APCS or\nthe RCS. There shall be no maneuvering of the OA with the SPS.\nThe SWS will provide the capability to perform the following Z local\nvertical attitude (Z-LV) maneuver profiles for earth resources experiments:\na) A maximum of 60 orbital degrees of Z-LV(E) centered about any\norbital location, returning to the solar-inertial attitude at the\nend of the pass. The 60-degrees Z-LV(E) pass may be performed\nduring each of a maximum of two consecutive orbits. When each\nof the consecutive passes is contained within a 120-degrees arc\ncentered about orbital noon, the SWS must remain in the solarinertial mode for at least four continuous orbits before two\nother consecutive Z-LV(E) passes are initiated. When each of the\nconsecutive passes is at any other orbital location, the SWS\nmust remain in the solar-inertial mode for at least five orbits\nbefore initiating additional Z-LV(E) passes. During a given 242-6\n\nhour period, the SWS shall provide a maximum of four continuous\nsequences of one Z-LV(E) pass (a maximum of 60 orbital degrees\ncontained within a 120-degree arc which is centered about\norbital noon), followed by one orbit of solar-inertial mode.\nThe Z-LV(E) pass defined herein is restricted to beta (B) angles\nbetween +50 degrees.\nb) A maximum of 120 orbital degrees of Z-LV(E) centered at any location within the orbit; returning to the solar-inertial attitude\nat the end of the pass. This mode may be performed for only one\norbit at a time and, once completed, the SWS must remain in the\nsolar-inertial mode for four continuous orbits before initiating\nanother Z-LV(E) pass. The Z-LV(E) pass defined herein is restricted to B angles between +50 and -30 degrees.\nThe total series of EREP operations (45 passes on three missions)\nwill consist of a combination of the above maneuver profiles according\nto final target selection and requirements. Approximately one-third of\nthe total EREP passes will be of the 120-degree variety.\n2.3.2.8 OA Internal Activities\nNominal mission planning shall provide for a shirtsleeve environment\nfor initial crew entry into the MDA and the OWS, and for subsequent normal\neveryday activities. Auxiliary face masks and oxygen supplies shall be\navailable, if necessary, to support initial crew entries into the MDA and\nOWS. Additionally, provisions and facilities shall be available to support\nan initial contingency suited entry (IVA) by one crewman from the CSM\ninto the MDA, and one or two crewmen from the MDA/AM into the OWS.\nThere shall be no requirement that a particular module of the OA be\noccupied at all times; however, immediately prior to and during EVA\'s the\nnon-EVA crewman shall be on the CSM side of the AM lock compartment.\n2.3.2.9 ATM Film Stowage\nTo assure return of ATM film in the event of an abort, the ATM film\nshall be stowed in the CM as soon as possible following EVA.\n2.3.2.10 Budgeting of Electrical Power\nPlanning shall provide for operation of the CSM fuel cells until\ncryogenic depletion; however, flight planning shall be based upon the\ncapability of the SWS electrical power system without fuel cell operation.\nThe additional power margin created by operation of the fuel cells may be\navailable for nominal usage during the mission depending on the situation.\n2.3.3 Launch Commit Criteria\nValidation of the following SWS status will be a prerequisite to\nthe launch of the SL-3 CSM. Limits associated with these conditions will\nbe determined in conjunction with the development of Launch and Flight\nMission Rules.\n* Payload shroud position to preclude contact with the\nCSM during its ascent.\n\xc2\xb7 S-II stage position will preclude contact with the CSM\nduring its ascent.\n2-7\n\nManned Space Flight Network/SWS instrumentation and\ncommunications established.\n* Pressure integrity of the SWS verified.\ne APCS operating and solar inertial attitude maintained.\ne OWS and ATM solar arrays operating.\n* The orbital parameters of the SWS must be such that mission\ndurations of at least TBD days based on a 2 a high density\natmosphere will be possible.\n* The SWS thermal control system, electrical power systems,\nattitude control systems and communication and data systems\nare operating within limits required for successful manned\nhabitation.\nIn addition to the above conditions, the space radiation environment\nmust be acceptable for manned orbital activity.\n2.3.4 Guidelines for Experiments and Systems/Operational Tests\nThis section sets forth guidelines to govern the planning and execution of experiments, systems tests and operational tests.\n2.3.4.1 Experiments Assignment\nExperiment assignments for Mission SL-3 are given in Section 3,\nTable 3.2-1, as specified in OMSF Headquarters Program Directive 43A\n(Reference No. 1).\n2.3.4.2 In-flight Systems/Operational Tests Assignment (TBD)\n2.3.4.3 Pre-mission Planning Guidelines\nThe following guidelines, and those in the subsections below are\nrepeated verbatim from NASA Headquarters Program Directive 43A and shall\nbe used in preparing the SL-3 mission plans:\na) Approximately one of every seven mission-days shall be scheduled\nas an off-duty day. Each off-duty day shall include performance\nof Experiments M071 and M073, crew rest and recreation, nominal\nmonitoring, crew planning, and ATM solar flare activity as required.\nb) Scheduling of crew activities shall permit rapid crew response\nto solar flares that may occur when the ATM console is not\nmanned.\n2.3.4.3.1 Group-related Experiments\nThe group-related experiments comprise the ATM, EREP, and in-flight\nmedical experiments.

Pre-mission rescue planning shall consider three plans\nwith respect to utilization of this jettison capability:\n1) jettison the disabled CSM prior to TPI of the rescue vehicle,\n2) retain the disabled vehicle until the rescue CSM docks at the\nMDA radial port and then jettison, and 3) leave the disabled vehicle docked to the axial port (i.e., don\'t jettison). For the\nactual rescue mission, a decision to utilize one of the aforementioned plans (or combinations thereof) will be made based on\nthe specific situation utilizing mission rules.\n2.3.6.2.2 Mission Profile Requirements\na) Trajectory planning for launch through insertion shall be similar\nto that for the nominal SL-4 mission, i.e., based on a northerly\nin-plane launch azimuth from KSC launch complex 39B for insertion\ninto an 81 by 120-n mi orbit.\nb) Total nominal mission duration shall be limited to five days\nfrom launch to recovery.\nc) The OA shall be maneuvered to the Z-LV(R) mode to provide acquisition light support to the rescue CSM during rendezvous.

The following cluster configurations shall\nbe considered:\n1) One CSM axially docked\n2) One CSM radially docked\n3) Two CSM\'s docked\nChoice of a system for cluster control during an actual rescue\nmission shall be made based on an assessment of the specific\nsituation and systems capabilities.\nc) The maximum length of time the rescue CSM may be docked to the\nMDA radial port shall be limited to 15 hours. The combined\nCSM/OWS shall be capable of sustaining five crewmen during this\nperiod.\n2.3.6.2.4 Other Mission Requirements\na) Subsequent to committing the rescue mission and prior to rendezvous/docking operations of the rescue CSM, the SL-3 mission\ntimeline for crew activities shall be re-planned to optimize\nthe scientific data return.\nb) Prioritized experimental data will be transferred to and returned\nwith the rescue CSM consistent with time and other mission constraints including safe reentry and landing loads.\nc) Provision shall be made for removal of ballast from the rescue\nCSM as required, transferred to and stowed in the SWS prior to\nundocking.\nd) Circumstances permitting, the SWS shall be deactivated\nand prepared for nominal revisit prior to crew departure.\ne) A backup capability (assumed axial CSM communications inoperative) shall be provided for communications between\nMCC-H personnel and crew aboard the OWS.\n2.3.6.3 Alternate Missions\nThe SL-3 alternate missions are TBD.\n\n2-12\n\n!\n\nVr~~~~~~~~~r\n\n*1\n~I\n\n;~~,\n\n~Ir~ ~\n\n~~\n\n4\'\nC~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n;\n~~~~~/\n\n: /\n\n/\n\ni\n\n/ /\n/~~~~/\n\nif\n\n/\n\n,\n\n3.0 SL-3 MISSION DETAILED TEST OBJECTIVES\n3.1\n\nGENERAL\nThis section identifies the experiments that\'have been approved by\nthe Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight for implementation on\nthe Skylab Program. In consonance therewith, OMSF, Headquarters Program\nDirective No. 43A has assigned experiments to specific missions, or, in\nlieu of stating specific assignments, has established other instructions\nfor planning and performing the experiments. General guidelines for the\nscheduling of experiments in the mission flight plans are listed in\nTable 3.2-1 and are repeated verbatim from NASA Headquarters Program\nDirective 43A and approved changes thereto. Changes to the guidelines\nlisted in the table require Level I (NASA Headquarters) approval.\nThis section shall constitute the controlling requirements necessary\nfor fulfilling the mission objectives stipulated in Program Directive 43A.\nIt is intended for use by those organizations concerned with flight planning, mission rules, procedures, data and support requirements and mission\nevaluations.\nThe percentages (where shown) with each Functional Objective (FO) in\nthe DTO represent a weighted value of the FO within the DTO. The sum of\nFO weights totals 100 percent. The weights represent that percentage of\nthe DTO which is completed when the respective FO has been satisfied.\nWhere percentages are not indicated, they are TBD. Those weighted values\nwithout an asterisk were assigned by the Skylab Program Office at the\nManned Spacecraft Center (MSC) pending receipt of official values from\nPrincipal Investigators. Functional Objectives with asterisks were assigned by the Principal Investigators.\n3.1.2 Experiment Assignments Table\n3.1.2.1 Format\nTable 3.2-1 places each experiment in one of two groups: inflight\nexperiments and pre and postflight experiments. The inflight experiments\nare divided further into three subgroups:\na)\n\nPassive Experiments - - experiments whose inflight crew support\n\nrequirements are either insignificant or non-existent.\nb)\n\nGroup-related Experiments - - experiments that require signifi-\n\ncant inflight crew support and which are closely related to each\nother either through common study of the flight crew or by integration into a single subsystem.

It has only a minor role in pre-mission planning,\nas Section 2.3.4.3.2 indicates. In real time mission planning, however,\nit may have a substantially more important function. Guidelines for the\nuse of the flight scheduling precedence in real time planning are developed\nin Section 2.3.4.4.\n\n3-2\n\nL0.Z\n\nZ\n\nr-\n\n0\n\n4~~1\n\n0\n*.-O\n*.\nU)\n\n4-n\n._\n\xc2\xb7\n\n(A\n\n4U\n\na)\n\nl\n\n.-\n\n.)o4\n\nE\n\nI\n\n.\n\nE\n\n\' \'-\n\na\n\na)\n0)c0\n\n0,\n\n.O\n\n0\n\nS4-~\nato\n\n~\n\nt/ \'4\n\n.C\n\n()\n\n-\n\nX\nLI\n\no\n"C\nC3\n0\n\nto\n0o\nC.)\n\n4)\n>)\n\nE\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(A- U\n\n:\n\nC\n\n_\n\n4 :\n\nE\n\n-4)\n\n00\n0\nC\nm\n\n0\n\n5\n~4\n\nS-\n\nt_\n\ncm-\n\nc\n.O\n\n5\n\n.C\n0.\n\nI\n\n.\n_\n\nI\n\nC\nt\nx\n\ncs\n\n5\n4)\n\n0.0\n\nw,\n\nC\n\n4--\n\naC\n\n0+\n. --\n\n--\n\n3\n,0E\n\nSMCD\n\nX\n\n0\n\n.\n\nI\n\n0\n\n>0\n4\n\n0l\n\n0\n\nU\n\nto\n\n0\n(L\n. w.\n\n0\n\n0\n\nS-\n\n- (\n\n0\n\n-\n\nLD C-\n\n-_\n\nr0\n\n~\n\nII\' 0.rC\n\n0.\n>\n\nN-\n\n4-_.\n\n44)\n00U)\nS5 C o\n\n0\n\nQ\nC:\nI\n\nF\n0\n\nr\n\n4_\n\n.\n.-\n\n, .\n\n. o\n\n5-\n\nLii\n\nE\n\nC\n\nc\n\n04CO , --\n\n-, :\n-C\n4- \'- --\n\nI\n\n*\n\n0-"\n4)\nr\n\n0\n\no\n\na)\nQ\n\n. 0 --=--Cr r\nI\n\n,\n\nI -\n\nI\n\n0\n\nE 00\n\n-C: CL\nt0\n,-\n\n0)0-\n\n1 0)\n\nC\n\nC\nDL\n\nI-3 --.-\n\n-0\n\nto\nL\n0\nL* c\no\n\n.-\n\n5\n\nvw <\n\nC C\n\n- I 0\n0\n\ni\n\no\n-\n\n4\n\n)\nC)\nv\n\n-\n\n-(\n\nC\n\n.U\n\n0\n\nI\n.\n\nUto\n\n0\n\n0\na\n.,\'t0\nCal~~~~\n\n,\n\nEx4\nS-\n\n4,-\n\nt.m\n\n4E\n\n4-)\n\nE\n\n0-\n\n-\n\na) 0.C\n\nX\n\nan (A\n-)\n\n-4\n\n(\n\n\'1:3\n\n4.\n\nC\n\n-\n\nC_\nI\nQ) . -0\n\noc\n\ni-\n\nrj\n\n.- (\n- I\n\n.\n\n.-\n\n._$0- 0\n0.

In this case, these types of studies may\nbe de-emphasized for future usefulness, but a greater need for\nfuture studies on orbiting and rotating spacecraft would be indicated.\nIf increased susceptibility is accompanied by decreased canal threshold, then an etiological (intralabrinthine) mechanism may be defined\nwhich would indicate the need for artificial gravity in terms of\notolithic modulating activity.\nIf there is increased susceptibility but no change in canal thresholds, then the importance of functional interaction of canals and\notoliths with other physiological systems (cardiovascular, etc.)\nin the production of behavior decrement or malaise would be demonstrated.\nIf there is no change in susceptibility but a definite change in\ncanal thresholds, then insufficient time for the effect to manifest\nitself in whole body response or the role of compensatory mechanisms\nto act would be indicated.\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nPerform Motion Sensitivity (MS) tests using the\n(60%)*\nRotating Litter Chair (RLC) in the rotating mode\nto determine susceptibility to Coriolis forces\nas a function of time in weightlessness.

A method for objectively evaluating sleep is\nto determine the electrical activity of the brain and the motions of the\neyes during the sleep period. On-board analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG), electro-oculographic (EOG) activity, and near real time\ntelemetry of analysis results will provide an objective progressive record of sleep throughout the flight.\nIt has been demonstrated that disrupted patterns of sleep are associated with modified performance capability. Accurate information regarding\nsleep in the space environment is therefore of practical significance and\nmay find useful application in future mission planning.\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nObtain EEG, EOG, and headmovement data from a subject continuously during an 8-hour sleep period for 21 scheduled\nsleep periods.\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nEEG, EOG, and headmovement data will be taken during 21\nregularly scheduled 8-hour sleep periods.

These programs encompass multispectral sensing at\nground level, by low and high altitude aircraft, by unmanned spacecraft,\nand from Skylab.\nSkylab EREP will provide additional and more precise data on\nspacecraft sensing capabilities, allowing a more thorough evaluation of\nsensor techniques and returned data correlation and application. The\nmanned Earth Resources (ER) facility also offers unique features not\npresently possible with automated systems. These are the ability to evaluate test site conditions, to acquire and track uniform small test sites\noff the ground track and to vary the data acquisition activities as systems conditions warrant.\nThe EREP experiments/sensors can be operated individually or as a\ngroup depending on the scientific requirements and other factors such as\nweather and vehicle capability. Data will be recorded on tape and film\nand returned to MSC for initial processing. There are no real time telemetered experiment housekeeping or scientific data.\nThe selection of EREP investigators and associated test sites is\ncurrently underway by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) on the basis of on-going or proposed new correlated activities\nwith the goal of maximizing the benefits from the above objectives. Announcement to the scientific community of the availability of this EREP\nfacility has been made by the Office of Space Sciences and Application by\nthe means of the "Opportunities For Participation In Space Flight Investigations" document. Final selection of the EREP investigators and related experiments for Skylab will be made upon completion of an evaluation\ncurrently underway of proposals received from the scientific community.\nThe present locations of active ER test sites are well known and\ndistributed worldwide. It is fully expected that 60 to 80 percent of the\nfinal ER sites will be collocated with these existing research areas.\nBased on this knowledge, and currently planned sensor and experiment DTO\'s\non EREP, the Skylab Orbital Assembly (OA) will provide reasonably flexible\nZ-LV(E) profiles allowing a limited number of 120-degree and 60-degree\npasses at any location within the orbit, i.e., sunrise, nighttime, etc.\nThis capability is described in Section 2.3.2.10.\n3.2.3.2 EREP DTO\'s\nThe five EREP sensor experiments presently assigned to the SL-3\nmission are:\nS190\nMultispectral Photographic Facility\nS191\nInfrared Spectrometer\nS192\nMultispectral Scanner\nS193\nMicrowave Radiometer/Scatterometerand Altimeter\nS194\nL-Band Radiometer\n3-97\n\nPreliminary flight planning guidelines for EREP have been identified\nand incorporated into the DTO\'s under Test Conditions. General test conditions relating to all EREP DTO\'s are contained in the following section.\nThe EREP DTO\'s are presented in alphanumeric order on later pages of this\nsection.\nIn order to minimize the total number of EREP DTO\'s, there will be\ntwo categories, i.e., hardware performance verification and applications.\nThe first will cover verification of sensor performance over specific\ntarget types and with specific operating modes. The included S190 through\nS194 DTO\'s are this type. These DTO\'s are based on the E-series sensor\nperformance evaluation DTO\'s contained in Reference 3. Additional EREP\nDTO\'s will be developed addressing the utilization of these remote sensors\nto ER disciplines and to a better understanding of possible applications\nof these sensor techniques. These DTO\'s are referred to as scientific\ninvestigations or "experiment" DTO\'s as contrasted to hardware verification DTO\'s and will be organized to cover total disciplines rather than\nindividual investigative areas. These are being developed in at least\nthe following ER disciplines:\nDisciplines\nGeography\nGeology\nHydrology\nOceanography\nForestry\nAgriculture\nAtmospheric Science\n\nLand Use Mapping, Biosphere Measurements\nGeological Mapping\nDetection of Rainfall, Overland Snow Cover\nSea States, Chlorophyll Content\nVegetation Mapping\nCrop Surveys\nSevere Storms, Air Mass Properties\n\nAt present, only the hardware performance verification DTO\'s are included since NASA has not currently selected the investigators for DTO\'s\nof the application category. Although accepted EREP investigation proposals may alter current planning, it is anticipated that vehicle capability is adequate and that many investigations can be accomplished with\nparallel studies and sharing of the same data. Final EREP planning and\nsite overpass scheduling can only be done once all EREP proposals have\nbeen reviewed and accepted for implementation. For these reasons, the\nsites and number of passes shown in individual DTO\'s may have little\nmeaning and often duplicate each other until all EREP DTO\'s are approved\nand a ground site versus sensor scheduling matrix can be constructed.\n(Reference 4 contains a list of preliminary EREP test sites.)\nTo the extent practicable, EREP experiment DTO\'s will appear in a\ncommon format containing general criteria and constraints applicable to\nthe entire group. Functional Objectives (FO\'s) will be identified with\nschedulable sensing of specific test sites where possible and prioritized\nfor incorporation into the Flight Plan in order of importance. Functional\nobjectives may be structured in either an "active" (schedulable entities)\nform requiring crew participation or other Flight Plan timeline scheduling\nconsiderations or a "passive" form not requiring the scheduling of specific mission timeline activity. In either case, provision will be made\nfor the acquisition of suitable data to satisfy the requirements of the\n\n3-98\n\nobjective. Depending on further definition of EREP applications requirements, functional objectives may encompass the acquisition of data through\nsingle or multiple sensing of single or multiple test sites.\n3.2.3.3 General EREP Test Conditions\nThe following test conditions are expected to be applicable to all\nEREP DTO\'s:\na) Distribution of test sites will be 70 to 80 percent in the United\nStates, with the balance in other countries and over ocean areas.\nb) Test Sites will be scheduled on the basis of priority, weather,\nand proximity of ground tracks of pre-selected EREP passes.\nc) Preliminary estimates of test site scheduling will be required\n12 hours prior to test site acquisition. Final selection of\ntest site(s) will be made and passed to the astronauts from one\nto three hours prior to test site overflight via a Pre-Advisory\nData (PAD) message. General format and content of PAD\'s are\ncontained in the mission Flight Plan.\nd) The time of each EREP data taking period will depend on test\nsite characteristics and availability. The number of performances will also depend on the quantity of film and tape\navailable.\ne) The OA drift rate will not exceed 0.05 degrees/second in any\naxis.\nf) The OA attitude will be the Z-LV(E) attitude and maintained\nwithin a pointing accuracy of 2 degrees in all three axes.\ng) Voice annotation on the AM tape recorder shall be made for each\ndata pass of the experiment noting such items as test site\nacquired, meteorological descriptions, unusual occurrences, and\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT) at start and finish of each data pass.\nh) Experiment scientific and housekeeping measurements will be recorded on the EREP tape recorder.\ni) The EREP scientific equipment operations will be conducted in\naccordance with procecures contained in Volume II of the Skylab\nExperiment Operations Handbook.\nj) EREP/ETC experiment data taking will normally require three\ncrewmen.\nk). Free liquid discharges into the OWS waste tank and controllable\nOA venting must be completed 15 minutes prior to experiment\noperation and avoided during experiment performance for S190,\nS191, and S192.\n1) The Best Estimate of Trajectory will be determined in order to\nprovide real time scheduling of EREP passes.\nm) Aperture doors and experiment optics (including their windows)\ncovers must be closed except during the data taking periods of\nS190, S191, and S192.\n\n3-99\n\n3.2.3.4 Sensor Combinations Matrix\nThe following matrix of Roman numeral coded groups versus EREP\nsensors identify the unique combinations of the sensors required for all\nER investigations received to date.\nThe group codes will be incorporated into future EREP DTO\'s through\nassociation with each functional objective. This coding method has been\nindicated in DTO\'s S190 through S194.\nEREP Sensor Combinations Matrix\n\nEREP SENSORS\nGROUP\n\n190\n\n191\n\n192\n\n193\n\nI\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nII\n\nX\n\nX\n\nIII\n\nX\n\nX\n\nIV\n\nX\n\nX\n\nV\n\nX\n\nVI\n\nX\n\nVIII\n\nX\n\nIXl\n\nX\n\nlX\n\nX\n\nXI\n\nX\n\n194\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nXII\n\nX\nX\n\nXIII\n\nX\n\nXIV\n\n3-100\n\nExperiment S190 (E-6/E-10)\n\nMULTISPECTRAL PHOTOGRAPHIC FACILITY\nObtain multispectral photographic data.\n\nPurpose and Background\nThe purposes are to gather Multispectral Photographic Facility data to\nevaluate and calibrate the performance of the multispectral photographic\nsensors and to evaluate the usefulness of a window and viewfinder for crew\nobservations.\nThe objectives are to determine the long and short term spectroradiometric accuracy of the hardware and the resolution and metric capabilities\nof the sensors. Transmission of the photographs will be measured and\ncorrelated with sensitometric data on the film to establish the absolute\nexposure. Both pre-flight and post-flight sensitometry will be applied to\nthe film so that conversion between exposure and film transmission is\ndetermined.\nDue to dynamic effects, a test site of fixed radiance properties should\nbe photographed periodically; the full moon provides such a test site. The\nmoon variation in radiance is a function of the geometry of the sun, moon,\nand earth and is not affected by atmospheric effects. S191 (Infrared\nSpectrometer) and S192 (Multispectral Scanner) data should be taken at the\nsame time S190 is used to photograph test sites. These data will be used\nto evaluate the relative accuracies of the sensors. Both long term and\nshort term variations of the sensors can be determined.\nThe short term variations in spectroradiometric measurements of S190\nwill be determined by taking data over the earth test sites.

The Skylab Radar-Altimeter\nis a pulse radar system which operates in five modes (See Test Conditions)\nover the ocean areas of the earth\'s surface. The main purpose of this instrument is to obtain scientific and engineering data on signals backscattered from the ocean surface. These data will permit a better understanding of the ocean backscatter process which is necessary to design\nvery accurate radar altimeter instruments required in the future. This\ninstrument also measures altitude data which may be used to relate mean\nsea level measurements to the geoid. The radar altimeter will obtain data\nfrom which the following information can be derived:\na) Signal correlation properties as a function of time,\nspace, and frequency\nb) Signal characteristics pertaining to pulse compression\nc) Sea state effects on transient pulse characteristics\nd) Sea surface radar cross-section measurements both at\nnadir and as a function of angle off-nadir\ne) Ocean return characteristics for a coherently coded pulse\nRadiometer/ScatterometerSensor Evaluation (FO 4). The sensors for\nthis Functional Objective (FO) are a microwave radiometer and scatterometer. Both active and passive sensors are combined to meet the two fundamental objectives:\na) System design/performance\nb) Correlation data for prediction purposes\nThe Radiometer is a passive sensor which measures the brightness\ntemperature from a cell on the earth\'s surface as a function of incidence\nangle from the surface normal in the microwave region (13.8-14 GHz). The\nmean value of the earth thermal noise signal is accurately determined by\nlong period observation. The measured quantity is compared to the measured\nmean noise value from two known temperature sources to yield an accurate,\nproportional measurement of the earth cell\'s emission temperature.\nThe Scatterometer measures the backscattering coefficient (sigmazero) of the earth at 13.9 GHz as a function of incidence angle ranging\nfrom zero to 48 degrees. This scattering coefficient is related to the\nroughness and dielectric properties of the scattering surface. Sufficient\nintegration times for both antenna noise and for the scattered return\nsignal (which looks like thermal noise) plus the receiver noise are taken\n3-115\n\nS193 (E-1/E-2)\n\nin order to obtain an accurate measurement of the average return power\nfrom which sigma-zero is calculated. The Radiometer and Scatterometer\nmay operate in various scanning and polarization modes (See Test Conditions)\njointly or separately. Collections of paired values of sigma-zero and\ntotal apparent blackbody temperature for each surface cell will permit the\nseparation of emissivity effects and reflectivity effects. These data will\nbe correlated postflight with sea state and wind conditions.\nRadiometer Sensor Evaluation (FO 5). The Radiometer will be operated as a single instrument in this FO with two combined objectives. The\nsystem design and performance will be evaluated and the feasibility of\nmaking surface emissivity measurements from orbital altitude with the\n13.9 GHz Radiometer will be determined.\nFunctional Objectives\nGroup*\n(VIII)\nFO 1)\nObtain Altimeter Experiment data of the\nfollowing test sites**\na) 149, Sensor Test Site 1\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\nf)\ng)\nh)\ni)\nj)\n\nFO 2)\n\nFO 3)\n\nFO 4)\n\nFO 5)\n\n150,\n151,\n152,\n153,\n154,\n155,\n156,\n157,\n158,\n\n"\n\n"\n"\n\n"\n"\n"\n"\n"\n\n"\n" "\n" "\n" "\n"\n" "\n" "\n\n"\n\n"\n\n"\n\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n,, 9\n" 10\n\nPerform Altimeter Experiment in conjunction\nwith Pulse Shape Experiment (Mode I).

Individual return pulses will be\nsampled and recorded for different sets of system parameters.\nb) Cross-Section Experiment (Mode II) - This mode will\nmeasure the radar backscatter coefficient with the\nantenna pointing at nadir and off-nadir.\nc) Time Correlation Experiment (Mode III) - Mode III\nwill measure the range gated correlation between pairs\nof pulses with variable time spacing. Individual return pulses (pairs) will be sampled and recorded for\ndifferent sets of system parameters.\nd) Pulse Compression Experiment (Mode V) - Mode V will\nmake measurements to compare the ocean return signal\ncharacteristics for a 10-nanosecond uncoded pulse with\nthe return characteristics for a 120-nanosecond coded\npulse compressed to 10 nanoseconds.\ne) Nadir Align Experiment (Mode VI) - Mode VI will be used\nto accomplish on-orbit alignment of the antenna. The\nantenna will be gimbaled automatically in pitch and roll\nto the position where the Automatic Gain Control voltage\nis a maximum. This antenna position will be redesignated as the nadir position (within 0.7 degrees). No\nreturn waveform samples will be obtained in this mode.\nFour altimeter modes will be manually selected by the astronaut in accordance with the test sites and number of\npasses as follows:\nTest Site\nNumber of Passes\nModes\n149\nTBD\nI, II, III\n150\nTBD\nI, III, V\n151\nTBD\nI, II\n152\nTBD\nI, II\n153\nTBD\nIII, V\n\n3-117\n\nS193 (E-1/E-2)\n\nTest Site\n154\n155\n156\n\nNumber of Passes\nTBD\nTBD\nTBD\n\nModes\nII, V\nI, II\nII\n\n157\n\nFO 2)\nFO 3)\n\nFO 1)\nFO 2)\nFO 3)\n\nFO 4)\n\nTBD\n\nI, III, V\n\n158\n\nTBD\n\nI, II, III\n\nOnly Mode I of the altimeter will be used during data\ngathering periods of this FO.\nOnly Mode II of the altimeter will be used during data\ngathering periods of this FO.\nTen data gathering passes per site will be conducted over\nTest Sites 108, 159, and 070.\nThe estimated time to complete each altimeter mode will be\n3 minutes and 30 seconds. The minimum recycle requirements\nfor each mode are TBD.\nMode VI will be initiated by the crewman prior to selected\ndata passes TBD.\nThe altimeter will be calibrated in each mode per procedures\ncontained in Volume II of the Experiment Operations Handbook (EOH).\nDuring the operation of the altimeter, no other portion of\nthe S193 experiment will be operating.\nThe Radiometer andScatterometer will be operated in the\nfollowing four scan modes:\na) In-Track Non-Contiguous Mode - This mode is used for\njoint radiometer/scatterometeroperation. The objective of the mode is the measurement of backscatter and\nbrightness temperature from the earth at five incident\nangles between zero degrees and 48 degrees. The five\ncells, A, B, C, D, and E will be initially viewed at\nantenna gimbal angles of 48, 40.1, 29.4, 15.6 and zero\ndegrees respectively. The antenna is then repositioned\nto 48 degrees and the slew and dwell sequence repeated.\nThe process will be repeated until each cell has five\nsuccessive scans at five successive smaller gimbal\nangles. During each dwell period, measurements are\ntaken for each transmit receive polarization pair:\nvertical/vertical (VV), vertical/horizontal (VH),\nhorizontal/vertical (HV), and horizontal/horizontal (HH).\nRadiometer measurements are also taken at each receive\npolarization (H and V).\nb) Cross-Track Non-Contiguous Mode - The cross-track noncontiguous mode is identical to the in-track noncontiguous mode with the exception that instead of\nscanning in the forward (pitch) direction with no roll\nmotion the scan is-in the cross-track (roll) direction.\n3-118\n\nS193 (E-l/E-2)\n\nThe roll dwell angles are 48, 40.1, 29.4, 15.6, and\nzero degrees. There are three cross-track non-contiguous\nscans available; left scan, right scan, and left/right\nscan.\nc) In-Track Contiguous Mode - The antenna scans continuously from about 48 degrees to zero degrees. The\nscattering cross-section will be measured over 1.6\ndegrees widths near 48, 40.1, 29.4, 15.6, and zero\ndegrees (gimbal angle) while the antenna scans in a\nsmooth manner. The roll angle (cross-track) is zero\ndegrees. In this mode, only one polarization will be\nselected by the astronaut. The choices are: VV, VH,\nHV, or HH.\nd) Cross-Track Contiguous Mode - This mode contains three\nsubmodes: Radiometer/Scatterometer (with one selected\nin-phase polarization pair); Radiometer only (with both\npolarizations); and Scatterometer only-(with both inphase polarizations). This mode provides cross-track\ncontinuous scanning with a zero elevation angle (zero\ndegrees pitch) and a non-zero elevation angle (pitch not\nequal to zero degrees). During the zero elevation angle\nscan (mapping mode), the antenna will scan continuously\nfrom about 29.4 degrees to zero degrees in roll. The\nscattering cross-section will be measured as the antenna\nbeam sweeps +11.375 degrees from one center angle (zero,\n15.6, and 29.4 degrees). The non-zero elevation angle\nscan provides a side to side scan as the antenna beam\nsweeps +11.375 degrees from a zero degree roll position\nat one pitch position (15.6, 29.4, and 40.1 degrees).\nMeasurements will be made for every 1.896 degrees of\nbeam center motion. In the scatterometer and radiometer\nsubmode the astronaut must select the polarization pair\n(VV or HH). In other modes, polarization selection\nwill be automatic.\nThe Radiometer and Scatterometer will be operated in the\nfollowing scan modes in accordance with the number of data\npasses as shown:\nScan Mode\nNumber of Passes*\nIn-Track Non-Contiguous\n8 (6)\nCross-Track Non-Contiguous\n8 (6)\nIn-Track Contiguous\n8 (6)\nCross-Track Contiguous\na) Radiometer/Scatterometer\n8 (6)\nb) Radiometer Only\n8,(6)\nc) Scatterometer Only\n8 (6)\nNote: The number indicated in parenthesis\nreflects the minimum pass requirements.\n3-119\n\nS193 (E-l/E-2)\n\nFO 5)\n\nDuring performances TBD, the antenna will be scanning in the\nin-track non-contiguous mode.\nDuring performances TBD, the antenna will be scanning in the\ncross-track non-contiguous mode.\nDuring performances TBD, the antenna will be scanning in the\nin-track contiguous mode.\nDuring performances TBD, the antenna will be scanning in the\ncross-track contiguous mode.\nPolarization and scan angle selections TBD by the crewman\nwill be performed per procedures contained in Volume II of\nthe EOH.\nFive data gathering passes will be conducted over Test Site\n108 for each S193 scan mode.\nThree data gathering passes will be conducted over Test\nSites 159 or 070 for each S193 scan mode.\nOnly one of the above scan modes may be selected at a time\n(six-position rotary switch).\nDuring the operation of the Radiometer and/or the Scatterometer, the Altimeter will not be operating.\nReflected, emitted microwave data will be obtained of\nTest Site 108 with low sea state condition (4 to 5 foot\nwaves) and no heavy cloud, rain, or storm conditions.\nDense clouds and rain should be avoided during data collection periods (the weather should be relatively uniform over\nthe data gathering areas).\nFour data gathering passes per site will be conducted over\nTest Sites 063 and 070.\nData will be acquired for at least two different cloud\ncover conditions (from totally clear to 100% overcast) and\ntwo different surface-subsurface temperature gradients\n(during clear weather) for Test Sites 063 and 070.\nFour data gathering passes per site will be conducted over\nTest Sites 106, 033, and 105.\nData will be acquired for at least two different cloud\ncover conditions (from totally clear to 100% overcast)\nand two different sea state conditions (from calm to strong\nbreeze) for Test Sites 106, 033, and 105.\nScan angle selections TBD by the crewman will be performed\nper procedures contained in Volume II of the EOH.\nOnly the Radiometer will be operated during data gathering\npasses of this FO.

The data and experience gained\nwill be used to improve ground based simulators and project future AMU\ndesign requirements and mission capabilities. The flying characteristics\nof four different AMU control concepts are provided by an Astronaut\nManeuvering Research Vehicle (AMRV) with four operating modes. Crewmen\npilots will fly various maneuvering tasks inside the Orbital Workshop\n(OWS) to test and evaluate each operating mode described as follows:\nHand Held Maneuvering Unit (HHMU) Mode.

The data obtained from this\nexperiment should be of sufficient accuracy to permit detailed physical\nanalysis of individual stars and nebulae. The experiment observations\nwill also provide a survey of a significant fraction of the Milky Way in\nthe UV wavelengths.\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nObtain selective UV photographs of as many desig-_\n(8.3%)*\nthru\nnated starfields as possible on a single darkside\nFO 12) pass.\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nCandidate starfields will be listed along with pointing\nthru\ncoordinates and recognition maps in the Experiment Log\nFO 12) Book. The potential starfields to be photographed will\nbe updated by computer based upon exact orbital conditions\nof the Orbital Workshop (OWS). The updated starfields,\npointing coordinates (mirror tilt and rotation angles, etc.)\nwill be supplied to the crew 24 hours prior to the experiment session.\nThe spectrograph (consisting of a film canister, optical\ncanister, and mirror system) will be assembled into a\nunit and mounted in the anti-solar Scientific Airlock (SAL)\nand the mirror oriented toward the target starfield per\nprocedures contained in the S019 Experiment Operations\nHandbook.\nOne hundred fifty photographs of 36 starfields are required\nfor this experiment on this mission. It is expected that\napproximately 12 exposures can be made during each night\nside pass; therefore, approximately 12 night side passes\nmay satisfy the experiment objectives. However, the exact\nnumber of starfields to be photographed within the 150\nframe limit and the number of exposures per starfield are\ndependent upon the brightness of selected starfields and\ncannot with any certainty be scheduled prior to real time.\nTo maximize the scientific return of this experiment, it\nis highly desirable that within the constraint of the 150\nexposures, the astronaut be allowed as much flexibility in\nhis choice of stafields and exposure times as possible.\n\n3-143\n\nSO19\n\nIt is highly desirable to have two separate observing\nperiods with an interval of at least 5 days.\nThe duration of any given exposure will be within 10 percent of its programmed duration.\nProgrammed exposure times are 30, 90, and 270 seconds. The\nstarfield brightness will determine which combinations of\nexposure times are used. In some cases only two exposures\nmay be required, in other cases three may be required, and\nwhen the stability of the OWS permits (i.e., where the OWS\nhas a rate of 1/2 arc second/second or less and the direction is within 45 degrees of the direction of dispersion) a\nfourth exposure without the use of the spectral widening\nmechanism may be desirable.\nPre-exposed attitude knowledge of the Orbital Assembly (OA)\nto within 2.5 degrees (in the stellar inertial reference\nsystem) will be required in order to allow the operator to\nlocate designated target starfields.\nIt is highly desirable that the experiment be performed\nduring the dark side passes with durations exceeding 32\nminutes, when the moon is less than half illuminated and\nwhen the OA is in an inertially stable mode, e.g., Solar\nInertial Attitude (X-IOP/Z). The mirror should be erected\njust before sunset and retracted just before sunrise.\nFor each exposure the operator will voice record: a) the\nexposure number, b) target field identification, c) time\nof initiation correlatable to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) to\nwithin 1 minute, d) length of exposure, and e) comments on\nthe quality of image tracking conditions and any other noteworthy conditions relative to the experiment.\nTo minimize exposure time to radiation, the film canister\nmust be demounted and stowed in the film vault between observing periods separated by more than 12 hours. It is\npermissible to have the remainder of the experiment in the\nairlock during this period if the cover is placed on the\noptical canister and the assembly is vented to space. A\ntotal exposure duration to the ambient radiation environment\nthat will exist when out of the film vault shall not exceed\n96 hours for the film canister.\nIf it is necessary to remove the experiment from the airlock\nfor more than 12 hours, all experiment equipment (mirror\nsystem, optical canister, and film canister) must be evacuated to 1 torr or less. Evacuation is to begin within 30\nminutes of experiment disassembly.\nDuring all mission phases other than the experiment operation periods, the film canister will be maintained at a\ntemperature of 90 F or lower.\n0\n\n3-144\n\nSOl9\n\nAmbient temperature conditions are tolerable for the\nduration of experiment operation periods.\nThe UV optical components in the interior of the experiment hardware will be protected by storing in an evacuated\ncondition. Exposure to cabin atmosphere should be limited\nto a short time interval during installation into the SAL\nand again at removal.\nThe fog level on experiment film shall not exceed 0.36\ndensity units during the life of film.\nThe film canister stowed in its Flight Stowage Container\nwill be transferred to the Command Module prior to SL-2\nseparation at such a time as to be compatible with the constraint that the film canister shall not be out of the OWS\nfilm vault for more than 96 hours. All other experiment\nhardware will remain stowed as for launch.\nThe film canister containing exposed film shall be shielded\nfrom exposure to natural environments during recovery. As\nsoon as possible upon recovery, the film canister is to be\ntransferred to a temperature controlled storage area where\n0\ntemperature is to be maintained at no greater than 80 F.\nDuring transferral from the recovery vessel to the film\nprocessing laboratory, the film canister shall be contained\nand protected in a ground support handling container.\nS019 must time share the anti-solar SAL with Experiment S063\n(Ultraviolet Airglow Horizon Photography), S149 (Particle\nCollection), S183 (Ultraviolet Panorama), and T027/S073 (Contamination Measurement and Gegenschein/Zodiacal Light).\nT013 (Crew/Vehicle Disturbances), T020 (Foot Controlled\nManeuvering Unit) and M509 (Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment)\nmust not operate while S019 equipment is installed in the\nSAL.\nDuring experiment operation the following lighting conditions\nwill be required:\na) All interior lights in the spacecraft which could impinge on or scatter light into the spectrograph will\nbe extinguished during exposure periods.\nb) Red operating lights with no significant intensity at\nwavelengths shorter than 5500 A are acceptable without\nrestriction.\nc) All ports or windows from any remaining lighted portions\nof the OA will be covered to prevent light (x< 5500 A)\nfrom scattering into the spectrograph\nd) All exterior vehicle running lights will be turned off.\n\n3-145\n\nSO19\n\nThruster Attitude Control Subsystem (TACS) firings will be\nminimized when the articulated mirror system is extended.\nThere will be no TACS firings during an exposure period.\nMoisture must not be allowed to condense on the S019 mirror\nsystem.\nWaste disposal must not occur during or within 30 minutes\nprior to scheduled experiment operating periods.\nOutgassing which leads to redeposition on optical surfaces\nwill be avoided as much as possible.\nThe quality of the spectra (i.e., the wavelength resolution)\nproduced by this experiment depend critically on the spacecraft rates and spacecraft stabilization. Uniform rates\n(i.e., relatively constant over a period of 1 minute) are\nacceptable and of no concern up to magnitudes of 1 arc sec/\nsec. Rates between 1 and 10 arc sec/sec are acceptable;\nuniform rates in excess of 10 arc sec/sec are unacceptable.\nHigh frequency (approximately 1 hertz and greater) deviations\n(harmonic oscillations or random noise) are acceptable so\nlong as the 1 sigma amplitude of angular displacement does\nnot exceed 20 arc seconds.\nExcursions resulting from random transitory events, such\nas crew motion are acceptable without limitation or magnitude so long as the interval between such events exceeds 2\nminutes. More frequent excursions of this nature are acceptable only if the 1 sigma amplitude of the excursion is\n20 arc seconds or less.\nCrew motions are to be kept to a minimum during S019 exposures. Schedules of crew activities involving violent\nactivity (e.g., recreational activity such as handball,\noperation of mass measurement devices, etc.) are to be\navoided during S019 operation periods.\nIt will be necessary to inhibit momentum dump maneuvers\nduring the period when this experiment is operating since\nthis experiment cannot operate while the spacecraft is in\nmotion.\nSuccess Criteria\nFO 1)\nA minimum of 115 (77% of the 150) UV photographs of TBD\nthru\nstarfields shall be obtained and returned along with the\nFO 12) required support data.\n\n\' 14Ar\n\nSO19\n\nEvaluation\nFO 1)\nthru\nFO 12)\n\nFilm processing will be performed at the Manned Spacecraft\nCenter by the Principal Investigator or his representative.\nData reduction using the original flight film will be performed by means of a photometric film analysis facility at\nthe home laboratory of the Principal Investigator, Lindheimer Astronomical Research Center, Northwestern University.\nAll flight film handling and duplication will be performed\nby the Principal Investigator or his representative.

The spectral\ndata associated with solar flares is of interest in solar flare prediction\nand the effects of solar flares on the quality of radio communications.\nThe ability to accurately predict solar flares will be useful in the planning of manned space flights.\nThe data from this experiment will also be of use-to those in the\nengineering and scientific community with interests in the fields of\nastrophysics and plasma physics, as well as the development of methods\nof thermonuclear power production.\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nObtain photographic data of the "quiet" sun in\n(50%)*\nthe wavelength region from 10 to 200 A.\nFO 2)\nObtain photographic data of the "active" sun\n(50%)*\nin the wavelength region from 10 to 200 A.\n\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nObtain ten preplanned exposures of "quiet" sun per procedures contained in the S020 Experiment Operations\nHandbook (EOH) as follows:\na) 2 exposures of 60 minutes eacht\nb) 2 exposures of 30 minutes each\nc) 2 exposures of 15 minutes each\nd) 2 exposures of 8 minutes each\ne) 2 exposures of 5 minutes each\ntEach 60-minute exposure may be broken down into two\n30-minute exposure periods. It is mandatory that\neach 30-minute exposure be obtained on successive\norbits.\nIt is desirable that one set of each exposure sequence be\nperformed during the early stages of the mission and that\nthe other set be performed near the end of the mission.\nPointing of the experiment line-of-sight to the center of\nthe solar disk must be maintained within 0.25 degrees\nduring the exposure period.\nFO 2)\nPhotography of the active sun is to be scheduled for performance during periods when solar flare activity has been predicted. The 5020 assigned operator is to be on "Flare Watch"\nduring this period. It is not mandatory that the operator\nbe on station during this entire period. He may be engaged\n3-149\n\nS020\n\nFO 1)\nFO 2)\n\nin other activities but must be able to return and operate\nS020 within TBD seconds after a flare alarm occurs.\nDuring the "Flare Watch" period the experiment operator will\nperiodically TBD monitor experiment pointing.\nPointing of the experiment line-of-sight to the center of\nlikely flare activity must be maintained within 0.25\ndegrees.\nTen exposures will be allocated to a flare watch with approximately three exposures per flare. Exposure period will\nvary from approximately 1 minute during flare rise period\nto several minutes during flare decay period.\nA minimum of 48 hours of crew time in increments of 8 hours\nminimum is to be assigned to flare watch activity. A\nperiod of high probability of solar flare activity cannot\nbe predicted with a high degree of accuracy prior to 1 to 2\ndays before the occurrence. It is desirable that the 48hours of flare watch be scheduled with flexibility and the\npossibility of trading airlock time with other experiments\nthat do not have this near real time requirement.\nUpon completion of an exposure sequence for one solar flare,\nthe remaining flare watch periods may be cancelled. If,\nhowever, airlock and crew time is available, it would be\ndesirable to attempt to use the remaining film for either\nquiet sun or solar flares. If no solar flare has occurred\nduring the majority of alloted flare watch time, it would\nbe desirable to use the remaining flare watch time to secure additional photographs of the quiet sun.\nX-ray monitor display of Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) Experiment S054 (X-Ray Spectrographic Telescope) will be in\noperation during flare watch periods.\nIt is desirable that ATM Experiments S082A (Coronal Extreme\nUltraviolet Spectroheliograph) and S082B (Chromospheric Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph) be in operation whenever\nexposures are made of the "active" sun.\nBased on the assumption that experiment pointing will be\nperformed by maneuvering the Orbital Workshop (OWS), an alignment operation to align the S020 principal axis to the sun\nline will be required. This operation will consist of biasing the ATM sun sensor in increments of 0.1 degrees until the\nS020 operator observes the area of likely flare activity\ncentered in the S020 Boresighting Port optical display. A\nbias angle of 1.75 degrees away from Z solar inertial is\npresently the maximum allowable in order that Experiments\nS020, S082A, and S082B may be conducted concurrently.\nThe experiment will be mounted in the solar Scientific\nAirlock (SAL) and pointed toward the sun per procedures contained in the S020 EOH.\n\nq 1;I\n\nS020\n\nThe SAL outer hatch is to be closed for each dark side pass\nand opened at orbital sunrise.\nExperiment S020 uses the solar SAL and must not be scheduled\nconcurrently with S063 (Ultraviolet Airglow Horizon Photography), and T027/S073 (Contamination Measurement and\nGegenschein/Zodiacal Light).\nT013 (Crew/Vehicle Disturbances), T020 (Foot Controlled\nManeuvering Unit) and M509 (Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment)\nmust not operate when S020 equipment is installed in the SAL.\nThe experiment will be performed when the Orbital Assembly\n(OA) is in the solar inertial attitude (X-IOP/Z) solar\ninertial mode. Small angular bias correction may be required to point S020 at the sun since the experiment is\nhard-mounted to the SAL.\nAll contamination events (e.g., urine dump, water dump) will\nbe inhibited whenever the SAL outer door is open and an exposure is in progress.\nExperiment operation will be limited to the period from\nfive minutes after OA sunrise to five minutes before OA\nsunset.\nThe fog level on experiment film shall not exceed 0.2 density units during the life of the film.\nFilm temperature must be maintained between 35 and 75 F,\n\xc2\xb0\n0\n\nexcept that during preflight and reentry the maximum al0\nlowable temperature will be 80 F. Maximum cumulative soak\ntime at TBS\xc2\xb0F may not exceed 2 days.\nFilm canister interiors will not,be exposed to an oxygenrich atmosphere for more than 30 minutes.\nThe film magazines will be stowed in the film magazine\nstowage container (FMSC) which in turn will be stowed in\nthe OWS film vault during experiment non-operational periods.\nOne film magazine will be used at a time in the Spectrograph Assembly during experiment operation. The remaining\nmagazine will remain in the container in the vault.\nThe FMSC will be evacuated for 3 minutes prior to returning\nit to the OWS film vault in between experiment performances.\nAfter the final performance, the FMSC will be evacuated to\n1 torr.\nRequired telemetry measurements will be recorded for subsequent playback and transmission to the ground\n\n3-151\n\nS020\nThe following will be recorded by the astronaut using both\nthe voice recorder and the S020 portion of the crew log\nbook.\na) Vacuum Valve positions: closed, vented, open\nb) Film advance (index position)\nc) The angular offset bias in pitch and yaw required\nto point the experiment at the solar disk. It is\nalso required that the crewman at the ATM control\npanel voice record the angular offset bias input\nto the attitude control system.\nd) Any other comments pertinent to S020 experiment\nsetup, operation and restowage\nSuccess Criteria\nFO 1)\nFilm magazine(s) containing at least one exposure from each\nof the five preplanned exposure sequences shall be returned\nto the Principal Investigator.\nFO 2)\nTBD exposures of one flare shall be returned to the Principal\nInvestigator.\nEvaluation\nFO 1)\nInformation on the solar spectrum in the wavelength region\nfrom 10 to 200 A will be reviewed by the Principal Investigator. Although the total evaluation plan will be controlled\nby the Principal Investigator, the quality of the photographs will be noted, the data will be compared to that obtained by present earth-based and rocket-borne photography,\nand a datum will be established for a "quiet" sun.\nFO 2)\nPhotographic data of the "active" sun will be analyzed by\nthe Principal Investigator, and will include a comparison\nwith the datum obtained in FO 1. The potential effects\nof solar flares on radio communications will be reviewed.\nFO 1) The data from both the "quiet" sun and the "active" sun will\nFO 2)\nbe reviewed to determine if the ability to predict solar\nflares may be enhanced.

These photos, made on\na global scale, will be valuable in the studies of visible and UV mechanisms, and knowledge may also be gained pertaining to upper atmospheric\nmovements which seem to be associated with airglow variations.\nFunctional Objectives\nt FO 1)\nPhotograph the earth\'s ozone atmosphere at UV\n(40%)*\nwavelengths and photograph the earth and its\natmosphere at visible wavelengths.\nt FO 2)\nPhotograph the earth\'s twilight airglow at visible\n(60%)*\nand UV wavelengths. (Red arcs, aurora, and noctilucent clouds will be photographed during twilight airglow photography sessions when possible.)\ntThose functional objectives or parts thereof scheduled and completed on\nSL-1/SL-2 will not be repeated on this mission.\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nExperiment Assembly I (consisting in part of two cameras,\none for taking UV photographs and the other for taking\nregular color photographs) will be used. The UV camera\nwill be mounted at the anti-solar Scientific Airlock (SAL).\nThe color camera will be mounted in the wardroom window of\nthe Orbital Workshop (OWS) and will automatically take\nphotographs simultaneously with the UV camera.\nThree hundred exposures (150 UV and 150 color) are required\nto satisfy this portion of the experiment. It is estimated\nthat 15 exposures per earth pointing attitude (Z-LV[E])\npass can be made; therefore, approximately ten Z-LV(E) passes\nwill be required. These passes may be the same as Earth\nResources Experiment Package Z-LV(E) passes if the crew is\navailable.\nTracking will be accomplished by an astronaut who will keep\nthe optical sight on the UV camera pointed at some feature\non or near the earth\'s surface per procedures contained in\nthe S063 Experiment Operations Handbook (EOH).\nPhotographs will be made:\na) Over the United States to provide values for comparison\nwith ground based observations\nb) Over a variety of terrain, e.g., sea, desert, green\nforests or fields, cities, snow, cloud layers etc. to\nprovide a check on the efficiency of the three-color\nfilter principle.\n\n3-153\n\nS063\n\nc)\n\nOver the entire globe at different seasons and different\nlatitudes to view the ozone concentration as distributed\nover the earth, expecially in areas where no ground stations are available.\nThe optical sighting device will be kept pointed to within\n0.5 degrees on a chosen tracking feature.\nImage motion control (IMC) will be maintained by the experimenter through the duration of the exposure. Required\ntracking rates are functions of orbital position and target\naltitude. Approximate average rates are 1 degree/sec for\nthe ozone photography.\nThe 150 UV photographs will be obtained according to the\nfollowing schedule:\nQuantity 1 )\n\nSun Angle\n\n15(2)\n1515(2)(20\n\n600-40\xc2\xb0\n\n15(2)\n\n60\xc2\xb0-40\xc2\xb0\n\n30( 3 )\n\n40\xc2\xb0-15\n\n30(3 )\n30(4)\n\n40\xc2\xb0-15\xc2\xb0\n15 - 00\n\xc2\xb0\n\n30(4)\n\n15\xc2\xb0 - 00\n\nNotes:\n\n(1)\n\nNominal\nExposure Time\n20 sec.\n\n20 sec.\n\n2800\nlong\n\ni\n\n8 sec.\n\n83\n\n8 sec.\n2 sec.\n\nFilter\n(Angstroms)\n\nmed.\nshort\n\n2 sec. |\n\n3200\n2800\n3200\n2800\n3200\n\nOrbital circumstances may not permit scheduling to obtain\nthe desired number of exposures for each group of sun angles\nlisted. While the best pictures will be made with the angle\nbetween the sun and the local vertical at a minimum, the\nexperiment objectives can be met with longer exposures and\nlarger angles provided that at least 10 sets (20 exposures)\nare made for sun angles between 0\xc2\xb0 and 15\xc2\xb0 .\n\n(2) After each exposure, the camera/sight carriage must be reset to the start position. Exposures are to be made alternately through the two UV filters.\n(3) After each exposure, the camera/sight carriage must be\nreset to the start position. Exposures are to be made\nalternately through the two UV filters.\n(4) These exposures are to be made in pairs. On a given target,\ntwo exposures should be made in rapid succession, one through\neach UV filter.\nFO 1)\nThe 150 color exposures (one taken simultaneously with each\nUV exposure) will have a duration of 1/250 second.\nExperiment Assembly I of S063 must time share the anti-solar\nSAL with Experiments S019 (Ultraviolet Stellar Astronomy),\nS149 (Particle Collection), S183 (Ultraviolet Panorama), and\nT027/S073 (Contamination Measurement and Gegenschein/\nZodiacal Light).\n3-154\n\nS063\n\nFO 2)\n\nQuantity\n30\n30\n20 >.visible\n20\n20\n10\n30\n30\nU\n20\n20\n20\n10\n\nExperiment Assembly II, used for obtaining twilight airglow\nphotographs, will be attached to the solar SAL.\nThe airglow, together with the earth limb and background\nstarfield, will be photographed from the spacecraft night\nposition in the solar direction.\nTwo periods of observing time per orbit are available;\nduring spacecraft evening twilight and the other half during spacecraft dawn.\nThree hundred exposures are required to satisfy this portion\nof the experiment and will generally be divided into three\ngroups: 130 exposures of airglow in the visible spectrum,\n130 exposures of the airglow in the UV spectrum, and 40 exposures oft targets of opportunity consisting of red arcs,\naurora, and noctilucent clouds.\nThe 260 scheduled twilight airglow exposures will be obtained\naccording to the following schedule:\nNominal\nFilter\nExposure Time (sec)\n(Angstroms)\n30\n60\n120\n40\n80\n120\n30\n60\n120\n30\n60\n120\n\n6300\n6300\n6300\n5577\n5577\n5577\n3900\n3900\n3900\n2600\n2600\n2600\n\nThe 40 targets of opportunity exposures will be obtained\naccording to the following schedule.

At spacecraft dawn, the sequence will be reversed, i.e., 120, 60, and 30 seconds.\nWith working times greater than five consecutive minutes,\nit is desirable to obtain a series of alternate 6300 A and\n5577 A exposures with exposure times increasing from twilight and decreasing toward dawn. If less than five consecutive minutes are available, only the red or green\nfilter will be used during an orbit. The same procedures\nwill prevail when the UV camera is in operation; however,\nalternating the UV filters in one orbit is not necessary.\nExposures with any of the four filters can be made whenever\nthe portion of the twilight horizon that is being photographed is not in either the northern or southern auroral\nzone.\nThe internal lights that may cause light to enter the camera\nwill be extinguished during exposure periods.

Additionally, the purpose\nis to determine the persistence of circadian rhythms and the effect of the\nphenomenon of temperature compensation in the vinegar gnat.\nA statistical analysis of all data (ground and flight) acquired will\nbe performed to determine any variance between the circadian rhythms observed in the flight group while in orbit with respect to the circadian\nrhythms observed during the baseline run and those observed in the ground\ncontrol groups. The analysis will be performed by the experimenter at his\nfacilities using computer methods developed for this purpose. A significant digression of either the precision or lengths of the "free running"\ncircadian periods measured in space from those periods measured on earth\nwould constitute evidence of dependency of circadian organization upon\ngeophysical "cues". Conversely, continuance in space of the precise\n"free running" circadian periods measured on the ground would significantly\nreduce arguments in favor of dependency of circadian organization upon\ngeophysical "cues".\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nObtain data to determine the persistence of circadian (50%)\nrhythms in pocket mice.\nFO 2)\nObtain data to determine the persistence of circadian (50%)\nrhythms and the effect of temperature compensation in\nthe vinegar gnat.\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nSix pocket mice, in individual cages that provide living\nspace and food for each mouse, will be placed in orbit in\n,an internal environmental control system that provides a\nconstant atmosphere to the mice.\nMice cage temperature will be held constant within 0.5\xc2\xb0C\n0\nin a temperature range of 20(+2)\xc2\xb0C.\nThe cage pressure will be held constant within +2% in a\npressure range of 700(+60) mm Hg\nThe air composition will be maintained at a near normal atmosphere.\nNo crew operations are required except for removing power\nfrom the experiment upon completion of the experiment.

The largest portion of the impact\nsurface detection area consists of highly polished surfaces that have been\npre-scanned with optical microscopes. The remaining area consists of thin\nfilm. The principle of the multiple film detector system is to allow examination of the layered film as a unit to facilitate identification of\nfilm penetration events.

The data obtained from this experiment will be used in the broad sense to determine galactic structure and\ngalactic evolution. Specifically, the ultraviolet (UV) data of S183 will\nbe combined with previously gathered X-ray, visible infrared, and radio\nspectral data to accomplish this objective. Correlation will also be made\nwith the data of Experiment S019 (Ultraviolet Stellar Astronomy) so that\ncomparisons of the spectra and color indices of certain starfields can be\naccomplished.\nFunctional Objectives\n(8.3%)*\nObtain selective UV photographs of as many designaFO 1)\nted starfields as practical on a single darkside\nthru\nFO 12) pass for each functional objective.\nTest Conditions\nCandidate starfields will be listed along with pointing\nFO 1)\ncoordinates and recognition maps in the Experiment Log\nthru\nFO 12) Book. The potential starfields to be photographed will be\nupdated by computer based upon exact orbital conditions of\nthe workshop. The updated starfields, pointing coordinates\n(mirror tilt and rotation angles), etc. will be supplied to\nthe crew 24 hours prior to the experiment session.\nThe experiment will be operated through the anti-solar\nScientific Airlock (SAL) using the S183 Spectrograph Assembly (S183 SA) and the S019 Mirror System (S019 MS) in accordance with procedures contained in the S183 Experiment\nOperations Handbook (EOH).\nTwo crewmen are required to handle the S183 SA during\nexperiment preparation tasks and post operation tasks.\nThirty-five photographs of approximately 12 starfields are\nrequired for this experiment on this mission. It is estimated that three UV photographs can be taken during one\norbital night side pass; therefore, approximately 12 night\npasses may be required to meet the experiment objectives.\n\n3-165\n\nS183\n\nUV photographs of the starfields will be made on 35 of 36\nphotographic plates contained in a film carrousel (one unexposed plate will be used for control purposes). Simultaneous 16-mm Data Acquisition Camera (DAC) photographs of\nthe starfields will be made.\nThe duration of each exposure will be determined by the\nstarfield brightness and will vary from 20 seconds to 1260\nseconds. The S183 SA will be controlled by internal logic\nafter an operating sequence is started.\nThe experiment will be performed during dark side passes\nwhen the Orbital Assembly (OA) is in an inertially stable\nmode Solar Inertial Attitude (X-IOP/Z). The mirror should\nbe erected just before sunset and retracted just before\nsunrise.\nIn order to be able to correlate experiment data between\nS183 and S019 (photograph identical starfields with similar\ndegradation to film and mirror system) it is highly desirable\nthat at least one sequence of three photos for S183 be obtained on an orbit successive to an orbit where S019 is\nscheduled to obtain starfield photos. If successive orbits\nare not possible, then the closest orbit possible will be\nsatisfactory provided the time span is no greater than 24\nhours.\nThe experiment line-of-sight shall be aligned to within 30\narc minutes of each of the selected starfields utilizing\nthe S019 mirror system.\nS183 will share the anti-solar SAL with Experiments S019,\nS063 (Ultraviolet Airglow Horizon Photography), S149\n(Particle Collection), and T027/S073 (Contamination Measurement and Gegenschein/Zodiacal Light).\nT013 (Crew/Vehicle Disturbances), T020 (Foot Controlled\nManeuvering Unit) and M509 (Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment)\nmust not operate while S019/S183 equipment is installed in\nthe SAL.\nTime correlation to within 1.0 second Greenwich Mean Time\n(GMT) will be required with the "Shutter Open" timing signal.\nIf a Control Moment Gyro desaturation maneuver is performed,\nthe exposure sequence must be stopped and a new exposure\nsequence started when the maneuver is completed. It is,\ntherefore, desirable to inhibit such maneuvers during exposures.\nCrew motions are to be kept to a minimum during S183 exposures. Schedules of crew activities involving violent\nactivity (e.g., recreational activity such as handball,\noperation of mass measurement devices, etc.) are to be\navoided during S183 operation periods.\n\nS183\n\nMoisture must not be allowed to condense on the S019 MS.\nAny waste dumps or TACS firing which would either affect\nS183 viewing or contaminate the S183 and S019 optics must\nbe inhibited when the S019 MS is deployed.\nAny external lights of less than 6000 A which might reflect\ninto the experiment must be off during the operation of the\nexperiment. All ports or windows which might reflect light\nof less than 6000 A into the experiment must be covered.\nThe film carrousel cannot be exposed to more than TBD rads\nand the 16-mm films to more than TBD rads during t~h entire\nlength of the mission.\nOrbital Workshop internal light level of less than 0.5 footcandles is required during experiment sighting periods.\nThe film storage container containing the film carrousel\nwill be evacuated immediately following the film carrousel\nusage and before restowing in order to achieve a vacuum of\n10 torr. The S183 SA will be evacuated following the experiment performance and before restowing in order to\nachieve a vacuum of 10 torr.\nIf it is necessary to remove the S019 MS from the airlock\nfor more than 12 hours, it must be evacuated to 1 torr or\nless. Evacuation is to begin within 30 minutes of experiment disassembly.\nIt is not necessary to remove the experiment from the SAL\nduring the day portion of the orbit. However, the experiment will be demounted and stowed per procedures contained\nin the S183 EOH between observing periods separated\'by\nmore than 12 hours to minimize exposure time to radiation.\nAmbient radiation levels that will be experienced by the\nfilm carrousel while installed at the SAL experiment location\nare acceptable for a total duration of exposure not to exceed 4 days.\nThe film carrousel will be maintained at a temperature not\nto exceed 80\xc2\xb0F during Orbital Workshop (OWS) and Command\nModule (CM) stowage and all phases of the mission, except\nduring experiment operation. Ambient spacecraft temperatures\nduring operation of the experiment are acceptable. The\nthermal requirements of the 16-mm film are TBD.\nThe fog level on experiment film shall not exceed 0.36\ndensity units during the life of the film.\nFor each exposure that operator will voice record: a) the\nexposure number, b) target field identification, c) time\nof initiation correlatable to GMT to within 1 minute,\nd) length of exposure, e) DAC setting, and f) comments on the\nquality of image tracking conditions and any other noteworthy conditions relative to the experiment.\n\n3-167\n\nS183\n\nThe film carrousel in its film magazine storage container\nand 16-mm film magazine are to be transferred to the CM\nprior to reentry.\nIt is necessary for the crewman operating the experiment\nto know when the dark portion of the orbit starts to within\n1.0 minute.\nRequired telemetry measurements will be recorded for subsequent playback and transmission to the ground.\nSuccess Criteria\nFO 1)\nObtain 27 photographs of nine starfields using spectrograph\nthru\nassembly.

A second purpose is to demonstrate the operational\nfeasibility of a manual navigation system consisting of a hand-held sextant (SXT) and stadimeter.\nExperimental measurements of the angle between star pairs and between\nstars and the earth horizon were made using hand-held sextants in Gemini\nExperiments. This experiment will extend the Gemini results to include\nmeasurements of the star/lunar limb angle with a hand-held sextant and\nspacecraft altitude with a hand-held stadimeter.\nMidcourse type navigation measurements using a hand-held SXT will be\nmade during the dark portion of the orbit using star/lunar limb target\ncombinations.

The first element of this program\nis the ground-based zero-gravity simulation facilities which are used to\ncarry out experiment definition, crew training, and engineering evaluation. The second element is the in-flight evaluation carried out in\nthe Skylab Orbital Workshop. In carrying out this coordinated two-phase\neffort, it is expected that a much greater amount of information will be\ngenerated than would be derived from singular independent approaches.\nThe in-flight portion will yield the most accurate zero-gravity evaluation, but is limited by the usable volume within the Orbital Workshop\n(OWS), the relatively short time available for testing, the small number\nof test variables and test subjects, and the high costs involved. The\nground-based evaluation serves to overcome these shortcomings, but is\nhampered to an unknown degree by simulation artifacts imposed by the earth\ngravity environment. By providing a commonality of experiment maneuvering\ntasks for the two elements, the uncertainties regarding the simulation\nvalidity can be reduced, thereby increasing the value of the ground-based\nfacilities as a source of information for possible continued maneuvering\nsystems research and development.\nFunctional Objectives\nFO 1)\nPerform various maneuvers (Mode I) while flying\n(60%)*\nthe Foot Controlled Maneuvering Unit (FCMU) in\nshirtsleeves.\nFO 2)\nPerform various maneuvers (Mode II) while flying\n(40%)-*\nthe FCMU suited.\nTest Conditions\nFO 1)\nMode I maneuvers will be performed by a crewman in experiment runs 1, 2, and 3.\nThe Mode I maneuvers will be performed per procedures contained in the T020 Experiment Operations Handbook (EOH).\nThe crewman will perform in the shirtsleeve mode using the\nbackpack propulsion gas supply.\nThe time for runs 1, 2, and 3 is 15 minutes each for a total\nof 45 minutes in Session I.

Approximately 20 minutes\n(10 minutes each) is actual flying time.\nThe Propellant Supply Subsystem (PSS) and the battery provided with the M509 (Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment) Automatically Stabilized Maneuvering Unit (ASMU) are required\nfor this experiment.\nAll of the maneuvering activities of the experiment will be\nphotographed.\nData Acquisition Cameras (DAC\'s) will be operated at frame\nspeeds of 6 and 2 frames per second.\nFour short DAC sequences of about 60 seconds each will be\ntaken at 24 frames per second to show operation of foot\ncontrols under conditions of minimum input.\nApproximately 10 still photographs will be required showing\nthe general experiment setup.\nSubjective comments and a record of experiment runs will\nbe noted in the astronaut log books for return to earth.\nComments made by the subject and observer during each debriefing session scheduled during the experiment will be\ntape recorded for subsequent playback and transmission.\nRequired telemetry measurements will be recorded on the\nAirlock Module recorder for subsequent playback and transmission.\nThe maximum allowable spacecraft rate about any axis during\nan experiment run will be 6 degrees/minute.\nThe maximum allowable spac craft acceleration is 1.5 x 10-3 g\'s\nalong any axis and 1 x 10- degrees/sec. .\nA near uniform atmospheric airflow is required across the\nOWS floor during the performance of the experiment. The\nOWS diffusers will be adjusted to limit the atmospheric\nflow velocity to an average of 20 feet per minute over the\nperformance area.\nExperiment sessions must be scheduled at least 2 days apart\nto prevent over-pressurization of the workshop which would\nresult in loss of atmosphere gas through the workshop relief valve.\nq 1iQ\n\nT020\n\nExperiments using the Scientific Airlock shall not be in\nplace during T020 operations.\nThe time the crewman will perform in each mode of operations is summarized by experiment run in the following\ntable:\nExperiment Run Time\nSession\n\nRun\n\nTime (Min.)\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n15\n15\n15\n\n2\n\n4\n5\n\n15\n15\nTotal 75 minutes\n\nNOTE: Run times do not include experiment setup or stowage items.\nSuccess Criteria\nFO 1)\nThe crewman shall perform Session/Mode I (shirtsleeve) maneuvers for at least 30 minutes (flying time).

Each time the photometer is used, it measures all of the\nlight in its field-of-view (FOV). Scattered light from contaminant\nmaterial around the OA must be separated from the total measurement to\nanalyze the skyglow, which is primarily zodiacal light and starlight.\nSimilarly, quantitative-study of contamination is not possible without\nknowing the characteristics of the skyglow. Due to this similarity and\n-the fact that both S073 and T027 require knowledge of contamination and\nof starlight and zodiacal light, this DTO combines all the objectives of\nExperiment S073 with that portion of Experiment T027 which employs the\nPhotometer System. A separate DTO covers that portion of Experiment T027\nwhich employs the Sample Array System and which has.the objective to determine the change in optical properties of various transmissive windows,\nmirrors, and diffraction gratings due to the deposition of contaminants\nfound about the OA.\nThe Photometer System will measure three parameters which fully\ncharacterize the radiation from the skyglow and from the OA corona; i.e.,\nbrightness of the total and of the polarized components, and orientation\nof the plane of polarization. Measurements pertaining to the skyglow\n(zodiacal light, gegenschein, starlight, F-region airglow) are best performed on the dark side. Measurements on the sunlit side and at the\nterminator will be used to characterize the contaminant cloud and to\nprovide information on the skyglow.\nThe principal method of collecting photometric data which will\nsatisfy experiment objectives is to scan the areas under study (e.g.,\necliptic plane, anti-solar direction, and other regions of the celestial\nsphere) with the photoelectric polarimeter in the T027/S073 Photometer\nSystem using specific observing programs. These specific observing programs are described below according to the particular mode of programmer\noperation.\n\no)\n\nlm\n\nT027/S073\n\nMode 1.\na.\n\nFixed Position\nI to sun line (contamination)\nThis program is performed with the photometer pointed in a direc\xc2\xb0\ntion 90 from the direction to the sun.\n\nThis direction is\n\nmaintained from program start in the earth\'s shadow (A, below)\nto a position in sunlight (B). At that time other programs can\nbe performed to position C, where the photometer is again pointed\n900 from the sun and 1800 from its position between A and B. At\nposition D in the earth\'s shadow, the program is terminated. All\n10 filters are used and are continuously cycled between points\nA and B and points C and D.\n\nCONTAMI NATION\nPROGRAM\nRE-STARTS HERE.\n\n/\nSUN *\n\nC\n\nE R\n\n\\\n\nnH\n\n_ /B\n_\n\nEARTH \'S\n\ni\n\nSHADOW\nTHE PROGRAM IS STOPPED AT\nTHIS POINT AND OTHER PROGRAMS\nCAN BE INITIATED.\n\nDIRECTION\nOF\nPHOTOMETER\n\nThis program will be performed from the dark side (anti-solar)\nscientific airlock (SAL) and from the solar SAL.\nA change in brightness and, especially, in polarization as the\nspacecraft leaves the earth\'s shadow, is a direct measure of\nthe effect of the level of contamination (i.e., of the optical\nenvironment of the spacecraft). This program is capable of\nproviding near real-time in\'formation on contamination; therefore,\nit should be performed close to the beginning of the mission\n(i.e., before starting the ATM experiments).\nThis same program will be used at different distances (rod extension lengths) from the spacecraft to determine the distribution\nof contaminant material around the OA.\n3-186\n\nT027/S073\n\nAt any time this program is used it can provide information on\nthe zodiacal light at +90\xc2\xb0 elongation (angular distance from the\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nd.\n\ne.\n\nsun). Comparison of oFservations in the ecliptic and at the\necliptic poles then gives a measure of the flattening of zodiacal\ndust toward the ecliptic.\nGegenschein\nThis program is performed with the photometer pointed in the\nanti-solar direction. It starts at position C (see previous\nfigure) and continues through D and A to B, where the program is\nstopped. The program is intended as a monitor of short-term\n(minutes) changes in brightness and of possible changes associated with observing aspect with respect to the earth\'s shadow.\nContamination\nThis program is performed from the anti-solar SAL. A preselected region which includes part of the OA is observed before, during, and after an overboard venting (i.e., the program\nstarts prior to leaving the earth\'s shadow and continues for\nsome time on the sunlit side). - The camera system is an essential\npart of this program.\nEcliptic poles\nThis program is performed from the anti-solar SAL and from the\nearth\'s shadow only. All 10 filters are used. The shortduration dark periods resulting from the high inclination orbit\nare well-suited for this program. The north and south ecliptic\npoles could be observed during successive orbits.\nCelestial poles\nThis program is performed from the anti-solar SAL. All 10\nfilters are used, as in (d) above, but the program has to run\nfor a longer period at the celestial poles. It is not restricted\nto observation only from the earth\'s shadow. This program is\nparticularly important for relating the OA observations to\nobservations being obtained simultaneously from the ground support station. The observing times will be required near new\n:moon, and they must be coordinated with the ground station.\n\n3-187\n\nT027/S073\n\nMode 2.\n\nVertical Circle (A vertical circle is a scan in elevation\nat fixed azimuth)\n\na.\n\nScan in ecliptic\n67.50\n\n112.5 \xc2\xb0\n\nCE\n\nELEVATION\n\n112.5\xc2\xb0\nANTI-SUN\n\nA\n112\n1800\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nSUN\n\nRE FEREN CE\n1125\n\nPOSITION\nAZIMUTH\n\nPLANE\n\nb.\n\n(1) Anti-solar SAL. The photometer scans in elevation from B\nto A (anti-solar point). It then rotates 1800 in azimuth\nwith the shutter open and scans from A to C (see previous\nfigure). Limited space resulted in a packaging design\nthat would not permit continuous scans through 00 elevation.\nThe program is performed in darkness outside the earth\'s\nshadow (e.g., between points D and E of the orbit) to provide information on contamination backscattering and on the\nexistence of a gegenschein parallax.\n(2) Solar SAL. In this program the photometer scans in elevation from 112.50 to within 15 or 200 of the sun. As in\n(1) above, the mount rotates 1800 in azimuth, after which\nit scans in elevation from -15 or -200 to -112.5\xc2\xb0 (refer\nto the last figure). This is performed in the earth\'s\nshadow and is repeated during the daylight portion of the\nsame orbit.\nOther scans\nIn this program the photometer scans in elevation from 112.5\xc2\xb0 to\n150 at the azimuth corresponding to the plane of the ecliptic.\nAt that point, it rotates 900 in azimuth (at northern ecliptic\nlatitudes), and the photometer returns from 15 to 112.50 elevation. This operation is repeated for each of the 10 filters.\n\n3-1 8l\n\nT027/S073\n\nMode 3.\na.\n\nAlmucantar (An almucantar is a scan in azimuth at fixed\nelevation)\nScan J to ecliptic at 90 elongation\n\xc2\xb0\nThis program from the anti-solar SAL is performed from both\ninside and outside the earth\'s shadow. The elevation is pre-set\nto 90\xc2\xb0 and the photometer scans in azimuth through its entire\nrange; i.e., 0 to 3540, 354 to 00, etc.\n\nb.\n\nContamination\nThis program is performed from the solar SAL at octal equivalents\nof elevations 15, 20, 25, and 30 (decimal). The photometer\n\xc2\xb0\nscans clockwise (CW), i.e., increases in azimuth, with one filter, returns CCW with the next filter, etc., through the 10\nfilters - all at the same elevation (see below). The elevation\nis then manually changed to its next position, and the previous\nset of measurements is repeated. It should be possible to complete the program during the sunlit portion of one orbit. It\nrequires the presence of an astronaut for perhaps 1 minute every\n15 minutes to manually change the elevation.\n\nAZIMUTH\nELEVATION\n30\xc2\xb00.\n\n150-\n\n3-189\n\nT027/S073\n\nc.\n\nGegenschein\n\nThis program is similar to the previous program in that it\nscans through the entire range of azimuth at each of two elevations; 2.8 and 4.20 - using all 10 filters. This program is\n\nperformed in order to examine the wavelength dependence of the\ngegenschein before changes in brightness are possible.\n3540 0\xc2\xb0 (AZIMUTH)\n\n(ELEVATION)\n2.8\xc2\xb0\nANTI-SUN\n4.2\xc2\xb0\n\nd.\n\nContamination\nThis program is performed outside the earth\'s shadow from the\nanti-solar SAL. It is similar to the previous program in that\nit scans through the entire range of azimuth at each of two\nelevations: in this case, 112.50 and 110\xc2\xb0 -\'using all 10 filters.\nThe purpose of this program is to examine the wavelength dependence of the OA corona before any change in brightness occurs.\nThe program requires the presence of an astronaut to monitor\nintensity and perhaps to change photomultiplier gain, since high\nlight levels will be seen as the instrument sweeps across the\nOA. This program is performed each time with the mast fully\nextended and with the mast extended two rod lengths.\n\n3540 00 (AZIMUTH)\n\n(ELEVATION)\n110.0\xc2\xb0-\n\nANTI-SUN\n\n112.5\xc2\xb0-\n\n3-190\n\nT027/S073\n\nMode 4.\na.\n\nSky Mapping\nGegenschein\nThis program is performed from the anti-solar SAL, and it involves concentric scans about the anti-solar direction. The\nphotometer scans over the entire range of 3540 in azimuth from\n\nb.\n\n2.8 to 28.0\xc2\xb0 elevation in steps of 2.8 \xc2\xb0. A map is required for\neach of the 10 filters, therefore, it will be necessary to use\nthe orbital counter; i.e., the program can be performed in its\nentirety during a sleep period. It is not essential that the\nmeasurements be performed only from within the earth\'s shadow.\nInner Zodiacal Light/Contamination\nThis program is performed from the solar SAL, and it involves\nconcentric scans about the sun. It is similar to the Mode\n4(a) gegenschein routine except that azimuth scans are performed\nfrom 15 to approximately 70\xc2\xb0 elevation (again, in steps of 2.80).\n\nAs with the previous routine, it will be necessary to use the\norbital counter to obtain the required number of maps (one map\nper filter). It is primarily designed to provide information\non contamination and on the main cone of the zodiacal light,\nincluding high and low galactic latitude regions. This program\nis equivalent to a program used successfully in observations\nobtained at the Haleakala Observatory, and it is essential that\nthose observations be related to the observations being obtained\nfrom the OA.\nMode 5. All-Sky Mapping\na. From the anti-solar SAL. This program is similar to that of\nMode 4(a), except that the elevation steps are 5.60 and the\nscans cover the entire celestial sphere (O to 3540 in azimuth and\n\nelevation scans from 2.8 to 112.50). This program requires the\nuse of the orbital counter.\nb. From the solar SAL. This program is similar to Mode 5(a) except\nthat it maps the entire sunward sky between 15 and 112.50 elevation (at all azimuths). This program also requires the use\nof the orbital counter.\nOther routines\nMode 0 Mode 0 is identical to Mode 1 except that the instrument is\ncapped and the photometer looks at a standard calibration source\nin place of the sky. It is necessary to perform Mode 0 one time\n(10 filters, 2 minutes) prior to the start of every Mode 1 program. One calibration sequence is automatically performed at\nthe conclusion of each sequence of Modes 2 through 5.\n\n3-191\n\nT027/S073\n\nMode 0.\na. System monitor\nThis program is performed from both SAL\'s at any elevation and\nazimuth. The photometer is capped, and the sequence counter is\nused to cycle through the 10 filters continuously throughout an\nentire orbit. This program provides essential information on\nsystem precision and on typical effects of the changing thermal\nenvironment.\nFunctional Objectives\n(20%)*\nPerform 7 photometer data scans from the

These will be made up of\nscanning sequences previously described and scheduled at\ntimes when the orbital and celestial conditions are appropriate for data collection.\nThe experiment will be mounted in the appropriate SAL,\nthe film magazine installed, and the photometer displayed\nper procedures contained in the T027/S073 Experiment Operations Handbook (EOH).\nAn astronaut will set up mode sequences, limit values for\nelevation and azimuth, and other appropriate switches,\nand initiate the scan sequences. It is not mandatory that\nan astronaut be present during scan sequences. However,\nwhen other duties permit, it will be highly desirable for\nan astronaut to monitor detector signal levels and programmer functions and make verbal and/or written record relative\nto experiment operation, particularly any condition which\nmight degrade results, such as changes in the optical environment around the OA.\nThe T027/S073 Photometer System will use both SAL\'s. The\nSAL\'s will also be used by S020 (Ultraviolet/X-Ray Solar\nPhotography), S183 (Ultraviolet Panorama), S063 (Ultraviolet\nAirglow Horizon Photography), S149 (Particle Collection),\nT025 (Coronagraph Contamination Measurements) and S019\n(Ultraviolet Stellar Astronomy). No two experiments can be\nscheduled concurrently at the same SAL.\nT027/S073 shares the extension mechanism with S149 and,\ntherefore, cannot be scheduled concurrently.\nWhen mounted at either SAL, the Photometer System will protrude into the operational volume required by T020 (Foot\nControlled Maneuvering Unit) and M509 (Astronaut Maneuvering Equipment). At the anti-solar SAL it will protrude\ninto the T013 (Crew/Vehicle Disturbances) operational\nvolume. In addition, M509 and T013 will use the tape recorder used to record Photometer System data. Thus,\nT027/S073 should not be scheduled concurrently with T020,\nM509, or T013.\nT027/S073 cannot be scheduled concurrently with M092\n(Inflight Lower Body Negative Pressure), M093 (Vectorcardiogram) and any operational biomedical measurements\ndue to the requirement for 320-sample per second data\nchannels in the Airlock Module (AM).\nT027/S073 should not be scheduled concurrently with\nmaneuvers into and out of the Z-LV(E) earth pointing attitude orientation.\nThe Photometer System temperature must be above the dew\npoint to avoid fog or frost on the optics and to prevent\n\n3-200\n\nT027/S073\n\nacceleration of corrosion due to excess moisture on precision surfaces and delicate components.\nAll exterior OA lights must be turned off and all OA and\nCommand Module windows that would interfere with experiment\noperation must be covered during data collection.\nThe film magazine will be placed in the Orbital Workshop\n(OWS) film vault before and after exposure and returned\nto earth in the Command Module (CM). The film magazines\nmust be kept below 80\xc2\xb0F.\nThe total radiation dosage for each film magazine must not\nexceed 2 rads.\nSolar inertial or any other known inertial orientation is\nmost desirable. Inertial orientation modes with random\nrates below 0.05 degree/second will be preferred. Constant\nrates up to 0.1 degree/second causing secular changes in\norientation are acceptable if they do not result in a loss\nof the designated target. Generally, if the particular\nscan is fixed or moving in the opposite direction to the\nspacecraft, the target could be lost. A back and forth or\ncircular scan probably will not result in a target loss.\nAngular accelerations which result in rates less than 0.05\ndegree/second are acceptable.\nDuring data collection, the maximum allowable rate error\nfrom average scan rates over the total scan range in shaft\nor trunnion, or during stationary pointing is +0.025 degrees\nper second.\nMajor maneuvers of the OA must not occur during experiment\ndata collection.\nAfter applying power to the Photometer System, a 30-minute\nwarmup time is required prior to data collection.\nWhen operating at the solar SAL, the Photometer System\nwill be extended and retracted while the OA is in earth\nshadow.\nThe photometer shall not be pointed within 15 degrees of\nthe moon or the sun.\nThe boom is to be retracted when scan sequences are separated by more than TBD hours.\nWhen the photometer is installed in the anti-solar SAL,\nthe electrical power is to be left on when not in a data\ntaking mode.\nPhotographic data will be obtained from the 16-mm Data\nAcquisition Camera which is in the photometer head of the\nPhotometer System. Photographs will automatically be taken\nby the Photometer System by single frames during an observation program.\n\n3-201\n\nT027/S073\n\nSuccess\nFO\n\nFO\n\nFO\n\nExperiment and spacecraft systems measurements will be\nrecorded for subsequent playback and transmission to the\nground.\nThe astronaut will voice record and time correlate comments\nrelevant to experiment operation.\nFor postflight data reduction, knowledge of the pointing\ndirection of the photometer will be required to within\none-half degree.\nIn addition, in-flight measurements will be required to\ndetermine the pointing direction of both SAL normals to\nwithin one-half degree. These measurements need only to\nbe made one time at each SAL but should be completed early\nin the mission.\nCriteria\n1)\nTBD of the 7 scans shall be completed for a minimum of\ntime as shown and the data delivered to the Principal\nInvestigator:\nScan\nTime\n1.

The\ntransport media vials will be stored in the food chiller\nuntil return of the crew. The vials will be transported\nto earth via the CM Resupply and Return System of the IMSS.\nFO 2)\nFour body samples from each crewman shall be obtained in\ntransport media 16 days prior to the end of the mission,\nstored in the food chiller, and returned to earth via the\nCM Resupply and Return System of the IMSS.\nFO 3)\nTwo air samples shall be obtained from sites TBD and returned to earth via the CM Resupply and Return System of\nthe IMSS.\nEvaluation\nFO 1)\nInitial processing of samples will be performed on the reFO 2)\ncovery vessel. The samples will be returned to the Manned\nFO 3)\nSpacecraft Center for identification of the micro-organisms\npresent and for further study. Technical reports will be\nmade available as appropriate.
