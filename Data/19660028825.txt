Removal and replacement of a prestart solenoid\nvalve on a rocket engine was selected a s the basic maintenance t a s k to be studied.\nT i m e s c o r e s for laboratory performance of the t a s k were compared with scores obtained\nfrom subjects operating on the t a s k during periods of transient weightlessness i n a\nKC-135 aircraft. Modified hand tools, a tool box, and a worker tethering system were\ndeveloped for G s e in the experiment. Major conclusions were (1) the factor contributing\nm o s t t o performance decrement i n space maintenance was space suit pressurization level:\n(2) i n this study, the effect of weightlessness on performance was less than the effect\nof s u i t pressure level, and, in this instance, it would not have been necessary to\nintroduce zero-G conditions to conduct a meafiinghl s t ~ + ~ of space maifitenance\n7\nperformance.\n\niii\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCT I 0\n\n,\n\'\n\nThis report presents the results of a series of preliminary stcdies directed toward\nunderstanding performance problems of space-suited workers in maintaining space\nvehicles under weightless conditions.\nThe data reported pertain only to the full-pressure s u i t designed by the International\nLatex Company (1960) and designated the State-of-the-Art" suit by National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA) The gloves used throughout these studies were supplied\nby the Crew Systems Branch of the Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA. The suit and gloves\nwere designed for seated application at control/display consoles. Since the equipment\nw a s not designed for our operations, it would be unfair to comment on its adequacy for\nthe performance of space maintenance tasks. Whether special suits or gloves will prove\nnecessary for space maintanance remains for others to determine.\n\n.\n\nI\'\n\nOur goal, initially, was to determine i f a high-fidelity ground-based simulation of\nzero-gravity was necessary to obtain valid information on zero-gravity maintenance\nperformance of pressure-suited subjects. Incidental to the overall goal, other problems\npresented themselves and were dealt with. These were\n\na. What performance effects on the selected tasks were attributable to pressure\ns u i t mobility restrictions ?\nb. Were serious measurable performance restrictions imposed by the zero-gravity\nenvironment ?\n\nc. Can a method be devised to quantitatively evaluate psychomotor performance\nof space-suited workers ?\nPROCEDURES\n\nA b a s i c maintenance task was selected which might be representative of the type\nof task required of a space-suited worker during the course of a prolonged space mission. This t a s k consisted of removing and replacing a prestart solenoid valve on a\nModel RL- 10 rocket engine. The engine was mounted within a plywood mockup o t h e\nr\nKC-135 zero-G aircraft (figure 1). Figure 2 shows a closeup of t h e prestart solenoid\n\nvalve.\nInitial performance data were obtained in the KC- 135 mockup at Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, Alabama, and were gained mainly from t h e training\nof subjects i n task performance sequence. Partial simulation of aircraft flight maneuvers was made possible by using a lever and spring scale device to impose 2-G loads\non the subject. The lever was attached to a line which was connected to a hook\nbetween the subject\'s legs. Dry air, conditioned to 1 0 C at a flow of 9.5- 1 1 . 5 cfm\nwas provided for conditioning and pressurization This combination of temperature\nand flow proved adequate to maintain a tolerable s u i t environment. Three subjects\nwere trained and tested in the mockup. One of t h e s e subjects was also tested in the\nKC- 135 zero-G aircraft with two other subjects at Wright-Patterson -Air Force Base, Ohio.\n\n.\n\n1\n\n,I\nI\n\nFigure 1.

Modifications were no more radical than increasing t h e diameter of tool handles, and were\nrequired t o ensure t h a t the tools could be positively grasped and held by hands encumbered by inflated gloves. Wherever possible, handles were made at l e a s t 1 . 5 i n c h e s\noutside diameter. The fiberglass tool box is 1 5 inches long, 10 i n c h e s wide, a n d 4\ni n c h e s thick, and is lined with VelcroF to hold tools in a zero-gravity environment.\nVelcro w a s also affixed t o t h o s e tools which were u s e d on our t a s k . Safety wires,\nu s e d to retain n u t s , were removed from the engine t o negate t h e possibility of puncturing t h e s u i t or gloves. The tool box w a s positioned on t h e front of the subject\n(figure 3) using a system of spring c o i l s and hooks. The box served effectively a s a\ntool receptacle. On occasion, however, it slipped out of its correct position thereby\npreventing the s u b j e c t , under pressurized conditions, from seeing that portion of t h e\nbox c l o s e s t to h i s body. The Velcro material required deliberate acts for removing and\nreplacing tools. T h i s added a control to the t i m e required for t a s k performance. Although no a n a l y s i s w a s performed, we believe the t i m e required for tool removal and\nreplacement was e s s e n t i a l l y the same for a l l s u b j e c t s .\n\n*This system and t h e fiberglass tool box were developed by C a p t a i r ?lusl;i,r a: -v\xe2\x80\x99JriqhtPatterson Air Force Base, Ohio.\n3\n\n~~\n~\n\nDuring ground-based tests, instructions given to the suited subject were identical\nto those he would have received during actual flight and followed, a s closely a s possible, actual flight condition sequencing. This sequence of operations was established\nafter observing t h e preferred performance mode of workers i n shirtsleeves and in the * *\npres Sure suit during preliminary performance trials. Subjects were required to observe\nthe sequence rigidly. In order to remove and replace the prestart solenoid valve, the\nsubjects were instructed to follow the procedures l i s t e d below.\nBegin on command.

In later tests it was necessary to\nrequire subjects to perform the sequence as many a s 31 t i m e s to a s s u r e that it was\nbeing rigidly followed. This procedure was followed because our only performance\nmeasure during the course of t h e s e studies w a s t i m e . It was imperative that minor\nchanges in performance b e kept to a minimum so as not to confound t h i s measure with\nt i m e differences attributable to slight changes i n sequence. Analysis of the t a s k\naccording to the method of Barnes (ref 1) indicated that approximately 100 hand operations had to be learned sequentially by our subjects.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 4 shows the data obtained from the subject who was trained and tested in\nthe mockup and later i n the zero-G aircraft. These data have been confounded by many\nuncontrolled variables and a r e presented only a s evidence of the difficulties of performing this type of research. Obviously, learning had not been completed under any\nof the test conditions.

Spurious measurements were made as indicated i n trials 5 , 6 ,\nand 7 where t i m e s were quite different when taken from a tape recorder and by counting\nf i l m f r a m e s . All subsequent data are based on f i l m f r a m e counts. Analysis of motion\npicture f i l m s of t a s k performance showed that the performance sequence was modified\nfrom trial to trial and t i m e scores could not justifiably be compared. Similar difficulties\nwere present i n the data of the other two subjects tested i n the mockup. The results\nobtained from all three subjects led u s to increase the number of trials required of subsequent subjects for task sequence learning.\nThe t a s k was slightly changed and the experimental procedures were modified for\nzero-G performance to allow u s to place more confidence i n the t i m e measure to b e made.\nA bolt-retaining clip w a s included as one of the tools and the experimenter was instructed\nto retrieve and replace any tools or other objects which floated away from the subject\nduring zero-G flight. The subject was required to retrieve any floating objects himself\nbut, i f an article floated beyond his reach, h e w a s to continue task performance. On\noccasion, parts of tools did float away from the work area, either because they had been\nimproperly placed i n the tool box or because they were inadvertently struck by t h e subject\nduring task performance or because they were too s m a l l to be properly held. The procedures maintained prevented t h e s e occurrences from affecting the t i m e measure. Tool\nloss w a s not a problem peculiar to the weightless condition but occurred on the ground\nalso whenever subjects performed the t a s k while suited and pressurized.\n\n5\n\nTwo subjects were tested extensively at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Figure 5\npresents data obtained from the first of t h e s e subjects under shirtsleeve conditions.\nWhere ground testing is indicated, the subject was t e s t e d with the rocket engine in .,\nposition inside the KC-135 aircraft, while the airplane was stationary on the ground.\nEssentially, except for the imposition of 2-G forces, this was the same as t h e mockup\nperformance. In order to negate the effects of the 2-G maneuvers necessary to achieve\nzero-GI a unique condition was imposed during flight testing. On t h e right s i d e of\nfigure 5 are plotted times for t a s k performance under shirtsleeve conditions for zeroand 1-G. The 1-G trials were conducted a s follows: The aircraft was required to roll\n6 0 " and execute a 2-G maneuver for approximately 20 seconds. When this was completed, the aircraft rolled back to its correct attitude and maintained straight and level\nflight for approximately 25 seconds. It would then repeat the roll and 2-G maneuver.\nTask performance was permitted only for the 25-second level flight period. In t h i s\nmanner, we hoped to control for the effects of the 2-G experiences inevitably included\nin studies dealing with zero-G parabolic flight. When the t a s k had been successfully\ncompleted under these conditions, zero-G parabolic flight was initiated. Zero-G and\n1-G flying alternated until 1 4 trials had been completed under each of the conditions.\nWe had felt that the imposition of the 2-G pullouts for zero-G testing might have\nintroduced a variable, which we will call fatigue, that is not present i n ordinary level\nflight and, since our measure may have been sensitive to fatigue, we attempted to\nequalize its effects for both conditions. Performance changes might have occurred i f\nour subject had been naive to parabolic flying but the t e s t subject used had had about\n2 years of experience i n zero-G flight. Task performance t i m e began to level off after\n180\n\nI0\n6\n\n------\n\n140\nv)\n\nSHlRTSLEEVE/lG/GROUND/CONTlNUOUS\nSHIRTSLEEVE/lG/GROUND/lNTERRUPTED\nSHIRTSLEEVE/lG/AIRCRAFT/lNTERRUPTED\nSHIRTSLEEVE/OG/AIRCRAFT/lNTERRUPTED\n\nI20\n\nQ\n\n2\n\nw\ncn\n\nI\n2\nW\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\n5\n\nIO\n\n1\n5\n\nI\n\n20\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n25\n30 35\nTRIALS\n\nI\n\n40\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\nFigure 5.

Some of t h e s e trials were accomplished under a n interrupted condition.\nThe interrupted condition refers to the fact that the t a s k was performed during 25-second\nwbrk intervals a s opposed to permitting the subject to praceed from start to finish without interruption a s was permitted on trials 1 through 15. Trials i6 through 20 were\nconducted under the interrupted condition. Trials 2 1 through 25 were conducted without\nparabolic interruptions. The difference was not sufficient for u s to consider it a serious\nlimitation of performance under weightless conditions. Results shown on this graph also\n\nl e d u s to conclude that there was no reason to continue imposing interrupted work periods\nbecause no serious differences in performance t i m e were evident.\nI\n\nP\nt\n\nData obtained on the second subject tested at \'vi\'right-Patterson Air Force Ease are\npresented i n figure 6 . Up to this t i m e , our interest concerned the effect of wearing the\npressure s u i t on performance time. The tasks were performed on the ground and no\nflight conditions were imposed. N o t e that on this figure the ordinate begins at 80\nseconds. This subject required loiigzr to perform the task, snder all conditions than\no\nthe previously discussed subject. Task training proceeded f r 20 trials. Although 20\ntrials were actually performed, a f i l m e d record was unavailable for trial number 3 and\na n accurate performance t i m e could not be plotted. Up to trial 30, the points plotted\nwere training trials. The subject, by the end of the training period, appeared to have\nreached o r was approaching 3 lower l i m i t to h i s performance t i m e on the t a s k .

This was called the\nshirtsleeve-equivalent condition. Apparently s o m e relearning was necessary after t h e\ntransition from the shirtsleeve to the shirtsleeve-equivalent condition, The same\ndegree of proficiency was achieved under the s h i r t s l e e v e - e q ~ v a l e n t\ncondition after 10\n-- trials as was achieved in 20 trials under shirtsleeve conditions alone. The three lines\non the right (figure 6) represent performance t i m e per trial under the three suited conditions. The shirtsleeve-equivalent condition was repeated on trial 3 1 . On trial 32,\ngloves and helmet were added to the suit but the s u i t was not pressurized. This was\ncalled the vented condition. Trial 33 required task performance under full suited conditions pressurized to 3.5 psi. Trial 34 repeated the condition of trial 31 and so on. In\nall, 1 2 shirtsleeve-equivalent, 1 2 vented, and 1 2 pressurized task performances were\naccomplished. One full week elapsed between trial 1 and trial 66. The data plotted\nthmugh trial 30 were obtained on the first day of testing and show the results of only\nt h e shirtsleeve and shirtsleeve-equivalent conditions.\nFigiire 7 shows the data obtained for this subject (also on the right of fisure 9)\nconverted to percentage scores. Shirtsleeve performance on trials 14 through 20 w a s\nchosen as 100% performance time. Because performance t i m e was conunually decreasing during t h e training trials, the 100% mean performance t i m e may be high, giving u s a\nbuilt-in conservatism on comparisons. Figure 7 shows that there was a n 8% increase\nin mean performance t i m e under the shirtsleeve-equivalent condition, a 30% increase\nunder the vented conditir?, and a 132% increase in mean t a s k performance t i m e under\nfully suited and pressurized conditions. These data, alone, are not startling, nor are\nthey worth much alone except as they corroborate the opinions of others who are well\naware of the mobility restrictions of pressure garments. They are also confounded, to\na certain extent, by learning which took place under m o s t conditions. However, to our\nknowledge, this is the first t i m e such opinions have been given t h e respectability\nobtainable through quantification. Combined with previous data, which showed t h e\ns m a l l performance restrictions imposed by the weightless condition, the need for\nresearch into methods of increasing pressure- suit mobility seems more apparent than\nresearch into the effects of zero-G. Also, it points out that much of the research which\nh a s gone into the development of cumbersome torqueless tools for the space environment\nmight more productively have been concerned with the integration of ordinary tools into\nthe man-machine system. Of course, the integration of tools into the system depends\nheavily upon tethering systems for u s e i n the weightless environment.\nFurther tests were performed to clarify the relationships between the RL-10 maintenance t a s k and other psychomotor performance measures.\nFigure 8 shows the results obtained from further tests with t h e s a m e subject. These\ntests were conducted on the ground at the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories and\nshow the performance changes which took place under various pressure conditions while\nthe subject sat and worked at a Purdue Pegboard. The results for this subject, perfonning under shirtsleeve conditions, fell at approximately the 50th percentile of h i s normative group. These data again show the increase i n performance t i m e with a n increase in\ns u i t pres s u n zation\n\n.\n\nl\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nThe s a m e subject was tested under pressurized and unpressurized conditions while\nperforming a reaction t i m e experiment. The subject was required to remove h i s hand\nfrom a depressed button in response to a light stimulus and reach and depress other\nbuttons within h i s reach envelope. Results on this performance were only taken for two\ns u i t conditions. Reach t i m e of response was automatically recorded (figure 9).\n9\n\nThese results, converrea IO a percenrciye ~ c i a i a ,c;umuiIieu wlrn i e s u ~ r s [ne\nu1\nPurdue Pegboard performance converted to a percentage b a s i s , plotted along with RL- 10\nperformance data on the same subject show the relationship between suit pressurization\nand performance degradation. This follows from our intuitive impressions of the corn2\nplexity of t h e s e three tasks. It is, perhaps, also a beginning to systematizing our\nmethods of s u i t performance evaluation without the u s e of expensive and complex tasks;.\nsuch as the removal and replacement of a solenoid valve.\n\nW\nv)\n\nt\n\n5 300\ne\n\n---\n\nFINE TASK\n\n----\n\n-\n\nPURDUE PEGBOARD\n\nINTERMEDIATE TASK - R L\nGROSS TASK REACH\n\nI\n\n1.00\n\n-\n\n- 10 ENGINE\n\nI\n\nI\n\n/\n\nI\n\n4.00\nSUIT PRESSURE - P S I\n\n2.00\n\n3.00\n\nI\n\n5.00\n\nFigure 9 . Comparison of Performance T i m e Percentage Increases\nfor One Subject Under Various Suit Pressures for Three Psychomotor T a s k s .\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe greatest contributing factor to performance decrement i n space maintenance\nactivity is space suit pressurization level. This holds true apparently under both\ngravitational conditions involved in this study. Performance decrement here is defined\nas a n increase i n time required to accomplish a given psychomotor t a s k .\nIn this study, the effect of weightlessness on performance w a s less than the\neffect of suit pressure level, and, in this instance, it would not have been necessary\nto introduce zero-G conditions to conduct a meaningful study of space maintenance\nperformance. In future studies, however, the relative effects of various constraints\non performance should be similarly determined since it is not yet possible to predict\naccurately the magnitudes of those constraints.\n\nNo data are available from this study on the effects upon performance of prolonged\nweightlessness. Conceivably, such an environment could introduct other effects and\noonstraints on human performance. Hopefully, such questions c a n be dealt with on\nprojects which permit continuous long-term exposure of personnel to orbital flights.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n1-\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nBarnes, R.

SPONSORING MIL1 b R Y\n\nTlVlTY\n\nAerospace Me&caf%es earch Laboratories\nAerospace Medical Division, Air Force\nSystems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh:\n\nA series of preliminary studies w a s performed to determine i f a high-fidelity\nground-based simulation of zero gravity is necessary to obtain valid information\nabout zero-G maintenance performance. Removal and replacement of a prestart\nsolenoid valve on a rocket engine w a s selected as the b a s i c maintenance task to\nbe studied. The t i m e scores for laboratory performance of the task were compared\nwith scores obtained from subjects operating on the t a s k during periods of transient weightlessness in a KC-135 aircraft. Modified hand tools, a tool box, and\na worker tethering system were developed for u s e in the experiment. Major conclusions were (1)the factor contributirlg most to performance decrement in space\nmaintenance w a s performanqe w a s less than the effect of suit pressure level, and,\ni n this instance, it would not have been necessary to introduce zero-G conditions\nto conduct a meaningful study of s p a c e maintenance performance.\n\nI.\n\nSecurity Classification\n\n'
