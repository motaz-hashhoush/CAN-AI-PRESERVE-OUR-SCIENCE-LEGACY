The CSTI Program was established to provide the foundation for technology development in automation and robotics, information, propulsion, and power. The CSTI High Capacity Power Program builds on the technology efforts of the SP-100 program, incorporates the previous NASA SP-100 Advanced Technology project, and provides a bridge to NASA Project Pathfinder. The elements of CSTI High Capacity Power development include Converrsion Systems, Thermal Management, Power Management, System Diagnostics, and Environmental Interactions. Technology advancement in all areas, including materials, is required to assure the high reliability and 7 to 10 year lifetime demanded for future space nuclear power systems.", "title": "CSTI high capacity power", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T11:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900051141, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Winter, Jerry M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "d5ad61936de24ac1be5d5a6a91377b32"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19900051141, "endDate": "1989-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IECEC-89", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "8a4278992fbd4573b983f5de0167fa59", "startDate": "1989-08-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19900051141, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900051141, "id": "a8d33c19b95b49ba8f1a5413701f5fc7", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
