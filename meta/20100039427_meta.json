Designed primarily for window inspection, PHOWID attaches to a smooth surface with suction cups, and raster scans a small area with an optical pen in order to provide a three-dimensional image of the defect. PHOWID consists of a graphical user interface, motor control subsystem, scanning head, and interface electronics, as well as an integrated camera and user display that allows a user to locate minute defects before scanning. Noise levels are on the order of 60 in. (1.5 m). PHOWID allows field measurement of defects that are usually done in the lab. It is small, light, and attaches directly to the test article in any orientation up to vertical. An operator can scan a defect and get useful engineering data in a matter of minutes. There is no need to make a mold impression for later lab analysis.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100039427, "id": "4d24405737f44103819ed81bcb2a1c8f", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100039392, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, November 2010", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100039427.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100039427/downloads/20100039427.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100039427/downloads/20100039427.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100039427/downloads/20100039427.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
