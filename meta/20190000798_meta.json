In the presence of a time-varying electromagnetic field, the first electrical conductor so-shaped resonates to generate a harmonic electromagnetic field response having a frequency, amplitude and bandwidth. A second electrical conductor includes a loop portion overlapping at least a portion of the spiral. The second electrical conductor is electrically isolated from the first electrical conductor. A radio frequency transceiver capable of transmitting and receiving electromagnetic energy is electrically coupled to the second electrical conductor.", "title": "Antenna for near Field Sensing and Far Field Transceiving", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2019-02-14T13:09:23.7100000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dudley, Kenneth L."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "7dc175604df949c782588e51792a3cd5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Szatkowski, George N."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "5d3d8b5e41c342beb184617ba637c7fd"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wang, Chuantong"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "ff8a863f3f1d4e008f719ca6f2ef7849"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, Laura J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "c5ff26fbd1a94b8eaf02354783156958"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ticatch, Larry A."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "9d111e2abc0c4dfd964328a227509347"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koppen, Sandra V."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "0aa1dd091ee449feb2d5eda58a97be1a"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nguyen, Truong X."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "d395ba0dfbb74a5e8c5c0ba061e405fe"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 20190000798, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ely, Jay J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "689dd4707cf3474b9f1f38bd5c4f8499"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20190000798, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000798, "id": "9e01cca54b60486cad92a6faf86e559b", "publicationDate": "2019-01-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000798.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000798/downloads/20190000798.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000798/downloads/20190000798.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000798/downloads/20190000798.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
