In yet another incremental extension of such work, a\ntransient capillary rise problem is solved for spontaneous flow along an interconnected\narray of open channels forming what is referred to as an \xe2\x80\x98open-star\xe2\x80\x99 section. This\ngeometry possesses several attractive characteristics including passive phase separations\nand high diffusive gas transport. Despite the complex geometry, novel and convenient\napproximations for capillary pressure and viscous resistance enable closed form\npredictions of the flow. As part of the solution, a combined scaling approach is applied\nthat identifies unsteady-inertial-capillary, convective-inertial-capillary, and viscocapillary transient regimes in a single parameter. Drop tower experiments are performed\nemploying 3-D printed conduits to corroborate all findings.\nNASA NNX09AP66A, Glenn Research Center\n\n'
