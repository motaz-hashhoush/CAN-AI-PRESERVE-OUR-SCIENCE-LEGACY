It is shown that atmospheric shear, turbulence, and stratification can provide the dominant mechanisms by which vortex wakes decay. Computations included the interaction of a vortex wake with a viscous ground plane. The observed phenomenon of vortex bounce is explained in terms of secondary vorticity produced on the ground. This vorticity is swept off the ground and advected about the vortex pair, thereby altering the classic hyperbolic trajectory. The phenomenon of the solitary vortex is explained as an interaction of a vortex with crosswind shear. Here, the vortex having the sign opposite that of the sign of the vorticity in the shear is dispersed by a convective instability. This instability results in the rapid production of turbulence which in turn disperses the smoke marking the vortex.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780016101, "id": "5d67139bae394cb8b2d5a1f5998a83d9", "publicationDate": "1978-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780016101.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780016101/downloads/19780016101.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780016101/downloads/19780016101.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780016101/downloads/19780016101.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
