The advantages of\nrun-time control optimization\nand arm reconfiguration\nare\nbecoming increasingly attractive as the complexity and criticality\nof robotic systems continues to progress, this paper presents a\ngeneralized control law for a spatial _\nwith 7 or more degrees\nof freedom (1301=) based on Whitney s resolved rate formulation\n[1]. Results from a simulation implementation utilizing this\ncontrol law ate presented. Furthermore, results from a two arm\nsimulation are presented to demonstrate the coordinated control\nof multiple arms using this formulation.\n\nvendors are marketing hardware with spadal 7-DOF control laws\n[8]). As a result, the focus of this effort is on 1) the spatial\nimplementation of a generalized resolved rate law for a 7 or more\nDOF arm based on Whitney\'s original formulation, and 2) the\nphysical performance characteristics of the control law.\nFORMULATION\nEquation (1) defines the robotic arm POR velocities as functions\nof the joint velocities. This relation may be derived using\nmethods of classical mechanics [9] based on the parameter\ndefinitions depicted in Figure 1"_.\n\nV\n\n(1)\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWithin a resolved rate motion control scheme, the joint motors\nare run simultaneously\nto provide varying joint velocities\nconsistent with constant commanded point of resolution (POR)\nvelocities in Cartesian space. The fundamental relationship\nbetween joint or configuration space and task space velocities is\nthe Jacobian matrix, which maps a linear transformation between\nthe two spaces. For kinematically redundant arms, transforming\ntask space commands (6 DOF) to joint space consistin_ of 7 or\nmore DOFs requires resolving the redundancy, i.e., solving an\nunderdetermined set of equations.\nTwo primary techniques have been proposed to resolve the\nredundancy\nas applied to robotic systems:\nthe method of\nLagrange multipliers and the generalized or pseudoinverse\ntechnique.\nWhitney [1,2] uses Lagranl_e mulupliers with an\noptimality criterion to be satisfied dunng the motion of the\nmanipulator.\nLiegeois [3] utilizes generalized inverse matrices\n(also referred to as pseudoinverse\nmatrices) and adds to the\nsolution a minimization vector representing the deviation from\nthe mean positions of each of the joints. Klein and Huang [4]\nsimilarly incorporate a function minimizing excursion from the\njoint center positions.\nBourgeois [5] implements Whimey\'s\nalgorithm\nwith a weighting\nmatrix to keep joints from\napproaching motion limits during a trajectory. In addition to\nthese efforts, other optimality algorithms have been proposed to\nrOVide avoidance with obstacles [6] and to minirmze torque\nding on the joints in a least squares sense [7].\n\nwhere J, the Jacobian matrix, is defined as\n\nj=[\n\nU,\nUlXR1\n\nU2\nU2xR2\n\n,..\n""\n\nUn\nUnxRn\n\n]\n\nThe Jacobian J is an mxn matrix, where m represents\nthe\ndimension of the task space and n the dimension of the joint\nspace. In the case of a kinematically redundant system, n>m\nand the system of equations is underdetermined,\ni,e., J is\nnon_uare and the inverse of J is undefined, Hence, additional\ncriteria need to be introduced to produce a unique solution.\n\nO\n8" 2\n\n_TASK\n\nDespite\nthese efforts,\nfew results\nhave been presented\ndemonstrating\nthe physical performance characteristics of the\ncontrol\nlaws [3,5].\nFurthermore,\nliterature\non spatial\nformulations and simulation implementations of kinematically\nredundant\narms is scarce (although numerous commercial\n\nU2\n\nR 1_\n2=_\'-"__\n\nSPACE REFERENCE\n\nFRAME\n\nFigure 1 - N DOF Configuration\ni\'Manipulator joint rates 0previously\n\n447\n\nOR\n\nSpace Parameters\ndefined as _\' in [9].\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers [10] can be used to optimize\nan objective or cost function subject to a given constraint. For\nthe problem at hand, the method can be used to "square" the\nsystem of equations, thereby producing an invertible solution to\nEquation (1). The problem can be formulated in the following\nmanner: suppose f and g are vector functions of some joint\nangle vector 0. Iff(O) has a local extrema (minimum or\nmaximum)\n\nat 0o subject to the constraint\n\nconstants (Lagrange multipliers),\nexpression is satisfied,\n\ng(O), there must exist\n\nA, such that the following\n\nv/(_o) = a Vg(Oo).\nWhitney [1,21 introduces\nmatrix form,\n\nthe segments, as if each segment was a 1 DOF system.\nIn\nessence, Equation (3) seems to provide a convenient means to\ninvert the equation set of Equation (1), rather than providing an\nactual physical criterion to minimize or maximize.\n\nthe following\n\n(2)\n\nobjective\n\nfunction\n\nin\nFigure 2 - Physical Interpretation\n\nf(O) = 1/2 [O]TA[0],\n\nof Objective Function\n\n(3)\n\nwhere A is an nxn diagonal matrix of weighting\nconstraint function, from Equation (1), is given by\n\nterms.

Baker and Wampler [11] propose finding\nw\ni\n".,. the joint speeds 0o which minimize some norm of 0, such\nas _T_ or kinetic energy." The actual physicaI interpretation of\nthis minimization criterion is illustrated in Figure 2. If the A\nmatrix contains the moments of inertia of each of the arm\nsegments\nabout their axis of rotation, then Equation\n(3)\nrepresents the sum of the rotational kinetic energies of each of\n\n448\n\nEquations (9) and (10) produce linear, goal oriented command\ninputs to the control law [9]. In other words, for an ideal\nsystem, Equations (9) and (10) will produce linear paths to the\ndesired POR orientation and position, both in a rotational and\ntranslational sense. For an imperfect system (sensor corruption,\nmotor lag, etc.), actual POR paths will have a tendency to "spiral\nin" to the desired orientation and position, always moving\ntowards the goal point regardless of the actual path taken.\nSIMULATION\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nThe control law of Equation (8) is implemented\nwithin the\nRobotics Software Testbed (RST) architecture developed by the\nMission Planning and Analysis Division at the Lyndon B.\nJohnson Space Center. The RST provides a discrete time cyclic\nexecutive with the capability of integrating both hardware and\nsoftware components into a simulation for both ground based\nand orbital applications.\nThe application discussed here is\ngeneralized for seven or more DOF and data driven so that\ndifferent arm configurations\nmay be tested without code\nrecompilation.\nA high level schematic flow diagram of the\nsingle ann simulation is presented in Figure 4.\n\nThe test case scenario used for each run consists of a single POR\nmove from an initial to a final position and orientation in the task\nspace.\nEach of the five simulations\nare identical\nupon\ninitialization except for the weighting of the A matrix. All runs\nare executed with a 12.5 Hz control loop cycle. The specific\ndifferences between the A weighting for each of the runs are as\nfollows:\nRun 1 Run 2 -\n\nconstant unity weighting over duration of the run.\nconstant weighting over duration of run with joint\n6 at two orders of magnitude above a//other joints.\nRun 3 - constant weighting over duration of run with joints\n2 and 6 at two orders of magnitude above all other\njoints.\nRun 4 - varied weighting over duration of run based upon\nactual joint distance from the joint median angle.\nRun 5 - a dual arm simulation with the characteristics of\nRun 1 for both arms.\nThe weighting\nsteps:\n\nalgorithm used for Run 4 performs the following\n\n1) find the minimum and maximum percentage deviations from\nthe median angles among the joints (percentage deviation is the\nactual angular deviation over the actual angular displacement to\nthe joint limit for the join0.\n2) scale the A component\nminimum percentage\nof\ncomponent corresponding\npercentage of deviation to\nproportionally\nbased on\ndeviations.\n\nFigure- Kinematic\n4\n\ncorresponding\nto the joint with the\ndeviation\nto 1.0.\nScale the A\nto the joint with the maximum\n100.0.

Cleghom and Bailey [9] discuss the\ncoordination of 6 DOF robotic arms utilizing the same linear,\ngoal oriented command generation scheme of Equations (9) and\n(10). Run 5 consists of a concurrent implementation\nof two\nidentical RRC arm models as used in Runs 1 through 4. The\narms are configured side by side with the POR of arm 1 placed\nat the tip of the last joint segment (as in Runs 1 through 4), and\nthe POR of arm 2 placed 0.2 feet off the end of the last joint\nsegment and 1.0 feet to the side; this places the POR between the\ntwo arms. The arms are initialized with their PORs at the same\nlocation in the task space, and then given identical POR\nmaneuver commands (the same maneuver executed for Runs 1\nthrough 4).\n\nArm Simulation Schematic Flow Diagram\n\nThe Robotics Research Corporation\'s (RRC) Model K-1607 TM\nseven DOF arm was selected as the test configuration for initial\nanalysis [8]. The arm has a reach of approximately five feet and\na R-P-R-P-R-P-R joint configuration, asdepicted in Figure 5.\nNumerous simulation runs were performed to help analyze the\nresponse of the control law. Specifically, five runs were chosen\nwhich best demonstrate the effects of the ,4 matrix weighting on\ncontrol performance.\n\nRESULTS\nSeveral interesting results are found common to all test runs.\nFirst, there is no appreciable change in the POR trajectory\nbetween the runs. This stability demonstrates the robustness of\nthe control algorithm while performing a maneuver, given a\nwide variety of A weighting\nvalues and joint solutions.\nAlthough the POR trajectories were uniform over the five runs,\nthe joint angle and joint rate histories differed considerably,\n\n7\n\nSecond, the A matrix values are important in a reladve rather\nthan an absolute sense. For example, Run 1 was executed with\n1) all ,4 values equal to 1.0, and 2) all A values equal to\n10000.0. No POR or joint differences were observed between\nthese two cases. Also, Run 2 was executed with 1) the A values\nfor joint 6 set at 100.0 and the remaining values set to 1.0; and\n2) the A values for joint 6 set at 100000.0 and the remaining\nvalues set to 1000.0. For both runs, the ratio of the largest A\nvalue to the smallest A value was 100 (two orders of\nmagnitude).\nOnce again there was no noticeable POR or joint\n\nFigure 5 - Robotics Research Corporation Model K- 1607 TM\n\n6t9\n\ndifferences\n\nwere\n\nthe importance\n\nobserved\n\nbetween\n\nthe two runs.\n\nof the relative magnitudes\n\nThis\n\nshows\n\nof the A values.\n\nThird, as shown by Bourgeois\n[5], increasing\na single value of\nthe A matrix relative to the other values has the effect of limiting\nthe motion of that respective joint. In general, as the ratio of the\nlargest to smallest A values falls below 100, the joint histories\napproach\nthat of the all unity case (Run 1). As the ratio\nincreases\nabove 100, the weighting\ntends to increase the motion\nof all the low A value joints rather than decreasing the motion of\nall the high A value joints.\nWhile all of the five runs exhibit common characteristics,\nthere\nare some\nspecific\nresults\nof the individual\nruns worth\nmentioning.\nIn Figure 6 notice that the acceleration,\nmaneuver\nvelocity,\nand deceleration\nregions of the POR velocity profiles\nare nearly linear.\nThese velocity\nprofiles result in linear POR\nposition\nhistories.\nAlthough\nthe rotational\nvelocity\nvector\ncomponents\nare approximately\nlinear, the orientation\nhistories\nexhibit a slight curvature throughout\nthe duration\nof the run.\nThis can be attributed\nto the fact the velocity\nhistories\nare\npresented\nas a rotational\nvelocity vector in the task space frame,\nwhereas the orientation\nhistories are presented\nas pitch-yaw-roll\n\n4\n\n_.\n\n!\n\n--\n\n3.5 :---1--..\n\n.....\n\n2.5 ....\n2--1\n\n----4_\n\n:\n\n--\n\n7--\n\n---\n\nPOR1.5\n......\nPO$\n1\n\nj\n\n(feet) 0.5\n\n-0._\n\n,\n\n30\n\n--\n\n...... ..>,\n"\n\n15__\n-15\nPOR-30 .........\n:\n\n4.5 6\n\n....................\n\n-75\n\n7.5 9\n\nml\n\n-3\n\n.10,\n10.5 12 13.5 15\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n3\n\n4.5\n\nTIME(mconds)\nA-X\n\no.25 --\n\nO-Y\n\n6\n\n7.5\n\n9\n\n10.5 12 13.5 15\n\nTIME (_x, ond=)\n\nO-Z\n\nA.

As the\njoint travels farther from the median position, the weighting is\nscaled to impede further motion away from the center position,\nwhich is not to be confused with attracting the joint to the center\nposition.

This control law\nwas derived using Lagrange multipliers to optimize a function\nconsisting of squared joint rate terms. This function can be\nphysically interpreted as the summed individual link rotational\nkinetic energies when the A weighting values are set to the link\ninerfias.\n\nAlthough the current analysis is based upon Whitney\'s\nformulation, other formulations\nmight be more applicable to\nminimizing practical kinematic quantities, such as joint travel.\nImplementation\nof additional formulations within the RST will\nbe an immediate subject of future research.\nIntegrating and\nanalyzing collision avoidance and path planning algorithms for 7\nor more DOF robotic arms is also planned.\n\nI _\n\n---\n\nRM8.0175}\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe relative rather than absolute magnitudes of the A weighting\nmatrix are important. Specifically, preliminary results indicate\nthe "magic 100" ratio to be a good engineering\nsolution.\nIncreasing a single value of the weighting matrix tends to limit\nmotion of the corresponding\njoint; however, this effect is\nreduced when applied to a higher number of joints.\n\nRun 5 is included to show the control law\'s ability to enable\nmultiple arm control based on the methodologies proposed by\nCleghorn and Bailey [9]. Figure 9 shows the root mean square\n(RMS) POR position and attitude error between arms 1 and 2\nover the duration of the maneuver. Although the maximum\nerrors of one third of an inch and half of a degree may appear\nslightly large, the proposed goal oriented resolved rate control\nlaw is self correcting. For the kinematic simulation of Run 5,\nthe PORs of the two arms are not constrained to be coincident.\nHowever, for an actual hardware implementation, the PORs of\nthe two arms would be constrained to be coincident while\n\n0o2+\n....\n\nAs an aside, notice that the joint and joint rate time histories for\njoint 4 remain relatively unchanged,\nThis can be explained by\nthe nature of the maneuver, which is primarily translational. For\nthis particular trajectory, joint 4 pitch is critical to attain desired\nPOR translation.\n\nResults from a simulation implementation utilizing this control\nlaw were presented to clarify the effects of the associated\nweighting matrix. Despite the variance in joint angle solutions\nand corresponding\nrates, the linear response of POR in task\nspace is maintained. This ability is ideal for multiple arm control\nimplementations utilizing independent control laws for each arm.\n\n0.0\n\n-180.01-1080.0\n\n0.0\n\ngrasping\nthesame object.
