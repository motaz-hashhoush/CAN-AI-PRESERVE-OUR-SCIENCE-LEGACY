They highlight borders and reveal areas of homogeneity and change. Segmentations are independently helpful for object recognition, and assist with automated production of symbolic maps. Additionally, a good segmentation can dramatically reduce the number of effective spectra in an image, enabling analyses that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive. Specifically, using an over-segmentation of the image instead of individual pixels can reduce noise and potentially improve the results of statistical post-analysis. In this innovation, a metric learning approach is presented to improve the performance of unsupervised hyperspectral image segmentation. The prototype demonstrations attempt a superpixel segmentation in which the image is conservatively over-segmented; that is, the single surface features may be split into multiple segments, but each individual segment, or superpixel, is ensured to have homogenous mineralogy.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009414, "id": "3d5a96ea45db4fda91f4fd8b96f770b1", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2013", "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130009410, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2013", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130009414.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130009414/downloads/20130009414.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130009414/downloads/20130009414.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130009414/downloads/20130009414.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
