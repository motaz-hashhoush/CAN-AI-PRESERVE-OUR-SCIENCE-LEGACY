The m-n.jor tasks\nof this program consisted of 1) fuel cell system studies of a Sp/ace Shuttle\npowerplant conceptual design (designated Engineering Model -1, EM-1)\nsupported by liaison with the Space Shuttle Prime Contractors; 2) component and subsystem technology advancement and; 3) a Demonstrator\nPowerplant (DM-1) test.\nFuel cell system studies, with the EM-1 as the focal point of design\nactivities, included determination of voltage regulation, specific reactant\nconsumption, weight, voltage level and performance characteristics.\nThese studies provided the basis for coordination activities with the\nSpace Shuttle vehicle prime contractor. Interface information, on-board\ncheckout and in-flight monitoring requirements, and development cost\ndata were also provided as part of this activity. Even though the two\nvehicle primes had different voltage requirements (115\' volts in one case\nand 28 volts in the other), it was concluded that either option could be\nprovided inthe fuel cell power system by the electrical hook\'up of the\ncells in the stack.\nComponent and subsystem technology activities included four areas of\ninterest.\nThese were: 1) the high power density cell, 2) reactant\npurifiers, 3) gas driven circulators, and 4) open cycle heat and water\nremoval.\nThe objectives of the high power density cell effort were to extend the\ncell operating life and to provide \'greater energy delivery capability.\nA single cell exceeded the NASA Ioal of 5, 000 hours, having operated\nmore than 10, 000 hours with performance at that time still above initial\nperformance. A 6-cell stack experienced a cell failure at 3, 260 hours,\nhowever, it did exceed the NASA e\'quivalent energy delivery goal.\nThe objective of the reactant purifier program was to provide a reactor\nwhich when used with a scrubber, !would minimize any detrimental effect\non a-powerplant of operating on propellant grade reactant gases containing carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons. Platinum, Palladium and\nRhodium catalysts were tested in a reactor to catalytically;.convert the\ntrace hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide for removal by a scrubber.\nThe\nRhodium catalyst was found to be 1-iost effective.\n\nPAGE Ni. 1\n\nPWA -4363\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nThe objective of the gas driven circulator activity was to provide a hydrogen\npump and a coolant pump which used the stored pressure energy of the supply\nreactants. Their use would eliminate electric motors and parasitic electric\nloads from the fuel cell system. The use of a gas driven hydrogen circulator\nnecessitated the development of a static water separator to remove product\nwater from the recirculating hydrogen stream. An oxygen driven coolant\npump was built and endurance tested. A two stage hydrogen jet pump and\nstatic water separator were built and bench tested.\nThe objective of the open cycle heat and water removal subsystem effort was\nto provide an alternate mode of removing fuel cell powerplant waste heat and\np.roduct water when the Space Shuttle vehicle radiator is inoperative. An\nintercell evaporator which vented steam overboard and a humidity sensing\nh~drogen/water vent system were designed to accomplish this objective. A\nfour cell operating breadboard system test demonstrated the feasibility of\nthis approach.\nThe objective of the DM-1 demonstrator powerplant task was to demonstrate\nthe fuel cell technology at the system level for a 2000 hour period. The\npowerplant demonstrated the ability to operate at low and high reactant supply\npressures, bootstrap (self-start) capability, spike transient capability to\n10.5 kw, open cycle water removal for periods longer than one hour and\nunattended automatic operation. However, the 2000-hour test objective was\nnot met. At 610 hours of operation, the test was interrupted because of a\ngear failure in the Block II Apollo hydrogen pump and at 750 hours the test\nwas terminated by a gas crossover failure of cell number four.\nThe pump problemn was determined to be the result of operation at an undamped\nnatural frequency which caused accelerated gear wear. Teardown inspection\nof the stack revealed a uniform physical distress on the cathodes of all the cells.\nAnalysis of this evidence indicated that the stack had been subjected to an over-pressure condition, however, review of the test data recorded during steadystate operation did not show such an incident. A series of hydrogen, oxygen\nThe\nand coolant overpressure tests were performed on identical cells.\nphysical condition of the DM-1 cells was duplicated by a 45 psi hydrogen overIt was concluded from this that the coupled regulator (breadboarded\npressure.\nwith two Apollo regulators modified to provide remote sensing) produced a\ntemporary pressure imbalance, permanently distorting the electrodes causing\na performance loss and an uneven heat transfer and current density situation.\nThis subsequently caused a localized matrix dryout and reactant gas crossover.\nAlthough it is theorized that the DM-] failure was caused by the regulator and\nthat a reliable, flight quality regulator would have a mruch lower probability of\ncausing such an event, it was decided that follow on activity should be directed\ntoward making the cell ].ess susceptible to reactant crosspressures.\nPAGE NO.\n\n2\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\n2. 0\n\nPWA-4363\n\nFUEL CELL SYSTEM STUDIES\n\nFuel cell system studies, with the Engineering Model (EM-1) conceptual\ndesign as the focal point, evaluated all of the technology advancement\nimprovements such as open cycle heat and water ren-moval, high power\ndensity (HPD) cell, gas driven pumps and static water separator, and\nreactant purifiers,\nThe powerplant was sized for 5 kw sustained power and\n10 kw peak power at \xc2\xb15 per.cent voltage regulation. This design served as a\nbaseline for liaison activities with the Prime Contractors, North American\nRockwell (NR) and McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft Corporation (MDAC), and for\ntechnology program planning.

Either option\ncan be provided in the fue cell power system by the electrical hook-up of the\ncells in the power stack.\nThe open cycle heat and water removal objective of the technology program\nwas to provide an alternate means of heat and water removal during launch\nand re-entry in the event that the spacecraft radiators were inope:rative.\nPrime Contractor studies of preferred vehicle configurations did not conclude\nthat this alternate mode of heat and water removal was necessary for a\nnormal mission. However, there were indications that for some alternate\nvehicle configurations and possible contingency situations, the open cycle\nmode of operation would be desireable.\nAs a resul.t of itas demonstrated\noperation in this program, it was concluded that open cycle heat and water\nremoval is feasible.\n\nReactant gas storage and supply system studies by the Prime Contractors\nindicated a high pressure system was preferable. A high pressure-reactant\nsupply is preferable from a fuel cell powerplant standpoint also in that it\nallows high or low pressure operation and permits the use of either electric\nor gas driven pumps. Studies by the Prime Contractors did not indicate a\nclear advantage for either electric or gas driven pumps. The technology\nassessment or program cost consideration will determine the final choice.\nAn-electrical schematic was produced at program completion to reflect the\nresults of the power system studies/land the integrated effort needed to\nachieve the Space Shuttle on-board checkout and flight monitoring requirements. This is presented in Figure" 2.\nThe significant results of the designsphase are summarized in Figure 3\nand represent design inputs for a follow-on system development program.\n\nPAGE NO/\n\n4\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY\n\nPWA -4363\n\nAIRCRAFT\n\nDON\nMAIN Et IE\n\nTA\n\nL0)\n\nOCLVT INPUT\nFOR STARTUP\n\nUP-ONAL\n\nSIrNA L\nSTARTIUP\n\n_\n\n[\n\n*HEATEROATIC\n\nSART\nE Iff _\nINIPCIRL\n\nCOl],\nHEATER\n\nPTIPONAL\n\nUT\nANEXVOLTAGE\n\nCof\n\n!)PTIONAL\n\nOOTORO\n\n(RIVE M\n\n_5 -L JSSTACK\n\nI_ L It\n_\n_\n\n.IV\n\nX\n\nVAI.A\n.ClCE\nPtOSIH\n\noRleE\n^E\n-\n\nI\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\'\n\nFigure 2\n\n-\n\nLEV-..,\n\nNIN O-CA\n\nPOSTIO\n\nIIN\n\nTEMPSENSOR\n\n0I\nPRESSURE\nPFe\n\nJ\n\nINHIBITOR\n\n_\n\nS\n\nITITITIE W8\nSOI\n\nANUAL \xc2\xb02\n\n%_\n\n%BVEREGULATE\n\n,\n\n.\nVI\n\n.,\n\nTE PST N ;)T\n\nPUMP\n\ni\n\nTE0\n\nCURRENT\nON\n\nIOT\n\nSAEP"AN\n\nR\n\nS_\n\naHPURGE\n\nREGULATED\nVALVE\n\nPRESSURE\n\nShuttle Power System Electrical Schematic\n\nO\n\nTECHNOLOGY COMPATIBLE WITH REQUIREMENTS OF SHUTTLE\nPHASE B CONTRACTORS\n\nO\n\nVOLTAGE LIMITS SHOULD BE AT LEAST \xc2\xb16%\n\n@ OPEN CYCLE COOLING NOT NEEDED INFUEL CELL\n\n@ OPEN CYCLE WATER REMOVAL MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUS\n\n0 CHOICE OF ELECTRIC OR GAS-DRIVEN PUMPS NOT SIGNIFICANT FROM\nSYSTEM VIEWPOINT\nC\n\nVOLTAGE LEVEL DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE LARGE EFFECT ON\nPOWERPLANT WEIGHT OR FUEL CELL PROGRAM COST\n\nFigure 3\n\n-\n\nFuel Cell Systeml\n\nStudies\n\nPAGE NO.\n\n5\n\nI\n\n.\n\n-\n\n..\n\nPWA-4363\n\nPRATT & wMiTNEv A I R C R A F T\n\n3. 0\n\nTECHNOLOGY ACTIVITIES\n\n3. 1\n\nHigh P o w e r D e n s i t y (HPD) C e l l\n\nT h e H P D c e l l d e s i g n w a s d e v e l o p e d for t h i s p r o g r a m , u s i n g t h e P C 8 B\nt e c h n o l o g y a n d m a t e r i a l s a s a b a s e to m e e t t h e NASA g o a l s of i n c r e a s e d\nlife a n d e n e r g y d e l i v e r y .

Early testing indicated high decay of the high\ncatalyst loaded cathode cells which were removed from the stack. Reassembly and subsequent testing indicated a deficiency in the mlatrix/hard\nframe joint design of the unitized electrode assembly resulting in a performance\nloss\'of the cells.\nChanges dictated by these experiences were made to the cell design and a\n6-cell assembly to this design was built and began endurance testing at\nDM-1 conditions early in February 1971 with a 5000-hour test objective. Operation was scheduled on an automatic test stand requiring a minimum of operator\nsurveillance. A performance loss on all cells was experienced following an\nautomatic shutdown due to loss of facility power at 1410 hours.: The performance\nrecovered fully in 500 hours of subsequent cperation although the cause was not\ndefined and the test continued until 3300 hours of operation when failure of cell\n#3 terminated the test. A failure investigation indicated cell #3 failed because\nof a localized matrix dry out and experienced a crossover gas failure.\n\nAlthough the 6-cell rig did not achieve the 5000-hour life, it did exceed\nthe equivalent energy delivery NASA goal. This plus the 10, 000-hour\nsingle cell operation with no decay provide a means of measuring the\npresent design against the NASA program goals.\nAdditional improvements in the cell design are possible by incorporating\nthe results of design support tests also conducted during this program. The\nlife potential of the base cell is known to be affected by the change in the\nelectrolyte carbonate level. This results from reactant gas transported\ncarbon elements and corrosion products of compounds in the cell assembly\nsuch as epoxy and asbestos.\nAn/investiga-ion into alternate frame materials\nidentified NoryD or Aryloli as suitable candidates. The use of EPR as\na bonding agent was also evaluat6d and found to be essentially inactive in\nthis environment. A follow-on program then could expect to make significant improvement in the cell life and energy delivery and possibly in cell\nweight.\n\nPAGg NO. 7\n\n/-\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\n3. 2\n\nPW\\ A-4363\n\nOpen Cycle Heat and Water Removal\n\nOpen cycle heat and water removal was explored in this program to provide\nan alternate nmode of removing fuel cell waste heat and product water when the\nvehicle radiator is inoperative during launch and re-entry.\nA schematic\ndiagram of the system is shown in Figure 5. Heat removal is accomplished\nthrough an intercell evaporator which is shown in Figure 6. Cooling water is\nintroduced into the evaporator through the water pressure regulator on command\nfrom. a reactor stack temperature sensor. The water is converted to steam in\nthe hydrophobic separator by the waste heat from the reactor stack cells and is\nvented overboard. The desired temperature is maintained by the steam vent\nback pressure regulator.\n\n*Proper electrolyte concentration is normally maintained in the reactor\nstack by the closed loop condenser and water separator.\nIn the event that\nadequate cooling is not supplied to the condenser, the humidity sensor will\nsense an above normal. moisture content of the recirculating hydrogen stream\nand will activate an overboard hydrogen/water vent. The valve is operated\ninternmittently as required to maintain the proper electrolyte concentration.\nA design study indicated a condensing type humidity probe would provide\nmaximum system reliability. This probe is shown in Figure 7. In this\nprobe, a cooling coil in the hydrogen gas stream condensed water vapor\nwhich was then wicked to the tip of a wet bulb thermocouple the-reby indicating wet bulb temperature. This signal, coupled with a dry bulb temperature,\nprovided a discrete signal which indicated the cell electrolyte concentration.\nPorous ceramic or fritted glass were selected as prime candidate materials\nfor the wick as they are both inert and have structural stability. The probe\nwas tested on the bench, used in the DM-1 powerplant test and in the 4-cell\nbreadboard power system test.\nThe breadboard power system test used a four-cell stack of 0. 15 ft 2 cells\nwith internal hydrophobic separators or water boilers . This rig had been\nbuilt and tested during an earlier Air Force contract and is shown in\nFigure 8. Difficulty had been experienced in the cell stack in sealing the\ngases, water and steam from overboard leakage prior to completion of the\nAir Force Contract.\nChanges in unitized electrode and hydrophobic separator frames were included and 40 hours of operation were accumnulated which included 21 hours\nof open cycle operation at current densities up to 1000 amps/ft 2 .\nThis\ntesting served to demonstrate that the open cycle heat and water removal\nconcept is feasible, however, the durability of the present frame and seal\nmaterials of the hydrophobic separator and the cell is inadequate. Any\nfollow-on activity on this subsystem, then, should emphasize material\nimprovement.\nPAGE NO. 8\n\nPWA-4363\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nH2 /H2 0\n!

Such devices would reduce the parasite power\nand improve system reliability by eliminating the electric motor drives. The\nstudy indicated an oxygen driven coolant pump could provide sufficient\ncoolant flow to remove the cell waste heat over a very wide range of fuel\ncell power. Likewise, a two stage hydrogen jet pump could circulate water\nbearing hydrogen through the cells proportional to demand power provided\nthe inlet supply pressure was A 200 psi. A static water separator was also\ndesigned and built to be used with the hydrogen jet pump and remove water\nfrom the condenser exit.\nthe oxygen driven coolant pump was a double acting diaphragm pump using\nfuel cell consumed oxygen gas to pump the liquid coolant through the power\n~ystem. The coolant flow rate was therefore proportional to the fuel cell\ngas consumption and hence the cell heat rejection. Figure 9 shows the pump\ndetails. Excellent power turndown capability resulted. The program conducted evaluated pilot valve wear, alternate diaphragm material and construction life capabilities until satisfactory results permitted the initiation\nof an oxygen driven coolant pump operating life test. 2014 hours of operation\nwere demonstrated on this test. Even though difficulties were encountered\nwith test stand contaminates and an early diaphragm design, the test demonstrated the capability of this pump to meet the requirements of the DM-1\npower system.\nDesign studies indicated that a two-stage hydrogen jet pump could satisfy\nthe flow turndown (maximum power flow/minimum power flow) required\nfor the hydrogen recirculation in a Space Shuttle power system. A twostage series hydrogen ejector with a pressure actuated secondary flow\nThis pump is\nvalve was designed to satisfy DM-1 flow requirements.\nshown in Figure 10. In this design, the primary nozzle is always in\noperation. As fuel cell power output increases, the hydrogen gas supply\npressure provided to the pump by the remote sensing regulator increases.\nWhen this pressure exceeds the preset spring pressure of the secondary\nflow valve, the valve will open allowing hydrogen flow to the secondary\nnozzle, thereby providing the required recirculation flow to remove product\nwater from the cells. The pump was built and bench tested. System flow\nand pressure drop requirements were met for a power range of approximately\n1 kw to 10 kw. Below 1 kw, the recirculated flow was below mininmum\nrequirements. Design modifications to improve the low power performance\nof the pump have been identified.\nThe static water separator design required considerable design test support.\nThis activity centered on evaluation of available wick and separator porous\nmaterial to meet pore size, flow rate and bubble pressure requirements in\nFritted glass\naddition to being inert, easily wetted and could be sterilized.\nPAGE NO.\n\n11\n\nPRATT\n\n&\n\nPWA-4363\n\nWHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nFigure 9\n\nOxygen Driven Coolant Pump\n\n-\n\nGAS SUPPLY\n\nSECONDARY\nNOZZLE\n\nPRIMARY\nNOZZLE\n\nSEC ONDAR\nFLOW\nVALVE\nFROM\nSTACK\n\nFigure 10\n\n-\n\nDM-1 Hydrogen Jet Pump\n\nPAGE NO.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTO\nSTACK\n\nPWA-4363\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY A\'RCRAFT\n\nand porous ceramics met these requirements best of all materials tested.\nTests of possible flow path geometries were made to determijne a design\nwith low pressure loss with ma:dmumn tortuosity.

Propellant\ngrade oxygen specifications allow a hydrocarbon content of 55 ppm. If\nthese quantities are experienced, it may be necessary to remove this contaminant from the oxygen used as a fuel cell reactant. This can be accomplished by converting the hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and then scrubbing\nthe carbon dioxide from the gas.\nThis pr gram was to evaluate existing\nCO 2 scrubber technology on multi-cell operating life and DM-1 tests, and\ndevelop design information for al hydrocarbon oxidizer catalyst.\nUtilizing available CO 2 scrubber experience at P&WA, CO 2 scrubbers were\ndesigned, built and installed on the operating life 6-cell test, and on the\nDM-1 Power System. The 6-cell test also had a CO 2 detector available to\ntest its effectiveness. The propellant grade oxygen gas was noted to have\nCO 2 content K 4 ppin and generally much lower. The scrubbers, which\nwere made by Union Carbide, removed cell CO 2 down to 1/2 ppm throughout the testing.\nSelected catalysts were tested us~ing oxygen containing approximately 55\nppm of methane to obtain design information for convertinig the hydrocarbon\nto carbon dioxide. The catalysts tested were:\n\nPAGE NO. 13\n\n/\n\nPWA-4363\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\n.\n*\n\n0. 5% Rhodium on alumina\n0. 5% Palladium on alumina\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\n0. 5% Platinum on alumina\n10. 0% Platinum on alumina\n\nThe activities of these catalysts in converting the methane in oxygen were\ndetermined at various levels within the temperature range of 200\xc2\xb0F to\n800\xc2\xb0F and the pressure range of 0 psig to 60 psig.\nThe Rhodium catalyst was the most active in removing methane from oxygen\n!at each temperature level. The other catalysts either had lower activity\nor decayed more rapidly. Increasing the pressure further increased the\ncatalyst activity.\nIt was concluded that this design approach was feasible for a Space Shuttle\ndesign in the event propellant grade gases are eventually selected for use\nby the fuel cells.\n\nPAGE NO. 14\n\n1.\nPRATT\n\n- A-_---A\n_1-HT\nIA_\n\\\n& WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\n6\nP 1 A --4363\n1T4-\n\nDEMONSTRATOR MODEL TEST\n\n4. 0\n\nThe DM-1 power system was a fully autonmatic 28-volt d. c. 5 kw rated\nelectric power supply. The power system was coupled Awith an automatic\nstart/stop sequencer and an Automatic Data Recording (ADR) system. The\nautomatic start/stop sequencer brought the power system to full operation\nin approximately 15 minutes following actuation of a single start switch,\nand the ADR computer provided automatic purge control and failure and\nwarning detection throughout the test. The DM-1 began testing in May 1971\nto demonstrate fuel cel": technology at the system level for a 2000-hour\nperiod. At 750 hours of operation, the test was terminated by a gas crossover failure of cell number four.\nThe DM-1 schematic is presented in Figure 11.\nREACTOR STACK\nPOWER\nACCUM\n\n,\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\n2~~~~~~~~~~\n\nXSYSTEM\n\n"\'l\n0\n\na\n\n8\n\nrN\n\nRxGENERATOR\n\nE\n\nIi\n\nICOOLANT\n\nE\nI\n\nTe tvlud\n\nrE\n\n-G\n\na\nIIaIe\nH2 VENTI\n\n2\nH\n\nCIr 1 ]\n\nn\n02 OUT\n\n-\n\nowerPRODUCT WATER\nsstem\n\nN\n.0 2 1N\n\nFigure 11\n\np\n\na\n\n\'\n\nCOOLANT IN\n\nPRODUCTIWATER\n\nh\n\n2 + H 2 0 VAPOR\n\nREGULATOR\n\nVAL VE\n\nCOOLANT OUT\n\nE_\n\n\'\n\na\nVC\nVEHICLE\n\nDM-1 Schematic\n\nThe test program evaluated the power system performance and operating\ncharacteristics during bootstrap starts at low and high reactant supply\nconditions. 200 channels of instrumentation provided digital printout of\npressure, temperature, voltage and current for all significant parameters\nduring steady-state operation to 10 kw. In addition, extensive stack tenmperature data uwas collected. Transient recordings of overall voltage and\ncurrent were made during transient load variation between open circuit\nand 10 kw.\n\nPAGE NO. 15\n\nPWA-4363\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nUse of the Automatic Data Recording (ADR) permitted Power\' System\noperation completely unattended for extended periods of time. Furthermore,\ncomputer monitoring similar to that contemplated for the vehicle was\naccomplished by establishing normal operating parameters which when\nexceeded would trigger a shutdown and inerting procedure.\nAnother significant demonstration during the test was uniform cell-to-cell\nperformance of the complete stack with high levels of inerts using an oxygen\nrecirculator.\nIn addition, the oxygen recirculator demonstrated significant\npurge efficiency improvement by increasing the ampere hours between purges\nallowable for any given performance degradation.\nTest anomolies were experienced throughout the test but, with the exception\nof two instances, were identified and corrected during the test period. The\ntwo remaining at the termination of the DM-1 test were the Block II Apollo\nhydrogen pump gear failure at 610 hours of operation, and Cell #4 gas\ncrossover failure at 750 hours. A failure investigation was conducted for\neach at the end of the program. The Apollo hydrogen pump problem was\nthe result of operation of this pump at an undamped natural. frequency\ncondition which resulted in an accelerated gear wear rate and resultant\nfailur e.\nThe Cell #4 failure had been preceeded by an average 85 mv/cell loss on\nall cells following repair of the hydrogen pump at 610 hours. .A complete\nfailure investigation revealed a uniform physical distress on the cathodes\nof all the cell.s. Analysis of this evidence indicated that the stack has been\nsubjected to an overpressure condition, however, review of the test data\nrecorded during steady-state operation did not show such an incident. A\nseries of hydrogen, oxygen and coolant overpressure tests were performed\non identical cells.\nThe physical condition of the DM-1 cells was duplicated\nby a 45 psi hydrogen overpressure.\nIt was concluded from this that the\ncoupled regulator (breadboarded with two Apollo regulators modified to\nprovide remote sensing) produced a temporary pressure imbalance,\npermanently distorting the electrodes causing a performance loss and an.\nuneven heat transfer and currentddensity situation. This subsequently\ncaused a localized matrix dryoutl and reactant gas crossover.\nAlthough it is theorized that the DM-l failure was caused by the regulator\nand that a reliable, flight quality.iregulator would have a much lower\nprobability of causing such an event, it was decided that follow-on activity\nshould be directed toward making the cell less susceptible to reactant\ncrosspressures.\n\nPAG\n\nNO.\n\n!\n\n16\n\n6\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nPWA-4363\n\nSignificant demonstrations of the test program are summarized below:\n750 hours of operation\n16 automatic starts and stops\nOperation at low and high reactant gas supply pressures\nSpike transients at 10. 5 kw\nSustained operation at 10 kw for 6 minutes\nOperation on\'fuel cell and propulsion grade reactants\nOpen cycle water removal for 1 hour\n\n5. 0\n\nCOMPLEMENTARY ENGINEERING\n\nThe reliability program consisted of reliability analyses and trade-off\nstudies conducted during the EM-1 conceptual design and testing phases of\nthe DM-1 prograrn. Results of these analyses and trade-off studies were\nused to direct design efforts toward minimizing the probability of a\npowerplant failure. The analyses also provided criteria for follow-on\nprogram reliability and test planning tasks.\nBoth powerplant and component Failure Mode and Effect Analyses (F\\4E.A)\nwere prepared to a level of detail consistent with the existing design\ndefinition at each particular phase of the program. Special stress was\nplaced on early input to the design concept from the FMEA. The powerplant FMEA was a general study which considered the effects of various\nfailure modes on the powerplant to provide an overview of the conceptual\ndesign.\nThe detailed component level FMEA\'s were performed on the (a) reactor\nstack, (b) hydrogen jet pump, (c) oxygen-driven coolant pump, (d) coupled\nregulator, and (e) humidity sensor probe. The purpose of these FMEA\'s\nwas to evaluate the effect of individual part failure modes on the component\nand on the total fuel cell powerplant. Information from these components\nFMCA\'s served as one source for the derivation of design criteria incorporated in the component design specifications.\n\nComponent level FMEA\'s were also performed on less well defined\ncomponents and on all the remaining ancillary components in the DM-l.\nInformation from these FMEA\'s will serve as a basis for more detailed\nanalysis in subsequent follow-on programs.\n\nPAGE NO.\n\n17\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY AIRCRAFT\n\nPWA -4363\n\nReliability trade-off studies were conducted to provide data for designing\na fuel cell powerplant.

The main\ncontributions to this goal were:\nEstablishment of a line of communication for the\nreporting and dissemination of system safety\ninformation.\nIdentification of potential hazards within early designs.\nGathering and dissemination of pertinent safety\ninformation required for further analyses.\nThe identification of safety action items for resolution\nin subsequent follow-on programs.\n\nPAGE tO.\nt~G\n\'q0\n\n18\n\n'
