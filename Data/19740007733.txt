Renzetti\nMission Support Office\n\nThe objectiws, functions, and organization of the Deep Space Network are\nsummarized. The Dee? Space lnstrurnentation Facility, the Ground Cornmunications Facility, arid the Network Control System are described.\nThe Deep Space Network (DSN), established by the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nOffice of Tracking and Data Acquisition under the system management and technical direction of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is designed for twc-way communications with unmanned spacecraft traveling approximately 16,000 km (l0,OOO mi) from Earth to planetary\ndistances. It supports or has supported, the following\nNASA deep space exploration projects: Ranger, Surveyor,\nMariner Venus 1962, Mariner Mars 1984, Mariner Venus\n67, Mariner Mars 1969, Mariner Mars 1971, Mariner\nVenus-Mercury 1973 (JPL); Lunar Orbiter and Viking\n(Langley Research Center); Piorieer ( Ames Research\nCenter); Helios (West Germany); and Apollo ( Manned\nSpacecraft Center), to supplement the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN).\nJPL TECHNICAL R E\n\n32-1126, VOL. XIX\n\n\'L\'he Deep Space Network is one of two NASA networks. The other, STDN, is under the system management and technical direction of the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. Its function is to support manned and unmanned\nEarth-orbiting and lunar scientific and communications\nsatellites. Although thc DSN was concerned with unmanned lunar spacecraft in its early years, its primary\nobjective now and into the future is to continue its\nsupport of planetary and interplanetary flight projects.\nA development objective ha; been to keep the network\ncapability at the state of the art of telecommunications\nand data handling and to support as many flight projects\nas possible with a minimum of miasion-dependent hardware and software. The DSN provides direct support of\neach flight project through that project\'s tracking and\n1\n\ndata system. This management element is responsible for\nthe design and operation of the hardware and software\nin the DSN which are required for the conduct of flight\noperations.\nBeginning in F 1973 a modified DSN interface has\nY\nbeen established with the flight projects. In lieu of the\nSFOF, a multimission hlission Control and Computing\nCenter (MCCC) has been activated as ;t separate functional and management elexent within JPL. This function, as negotiated with each flight project, will provide\nall computing and mission operations support for missions\ncontrolled from JPL. DSN coniputing support will be\nprovided sepal ately by the DSS. Radio metric, telemetry.\nand command data interfaces with the DSK are a joint\nDSN. MCCC, and flight project responsibility. The\norganization and procedures necessary to carry out\ntnese new activities will he reported in this document\nin the irear future.\nThe DSN function, in supporting a flight project by\ntracking the spacecraft, is characterized by five network\nsystems:\n\n(I) DSN Tracking System. Generates radio metric\ndata; Le., angles. one- and two-way doppler and\nrange, and transmits raw data to niission control.\n\n(2) DSN Telenetry System. Receives, decodes, records,\nand retransmits engineering and scientific data\ngenerated in the spacecraft to Mission Control.\n\n(3) DSK Command System. Accepts coded signals\nfrom mission control via the GCF arid transmits\nthem to the spacecraft in order to initiate spacecraft functions in flight.\n\nthrough the R F link with the spacecraft is known as the\nDeep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF); (2) the\nEarth-based point-to-poi- i voice and data communications from the stations to Mission Control is known as\nthe Ground Communications Facility (GCF); (3) the\nnetwork monitor and control function is known as the\nSetwork Control System (SCS).\n\n1. Deep Space InstrumentationFacility\nA. Tracking and Data Acquisition Facilities\n\nA world-wide set of Deep Space Stations with large\nantennas, low-noise phase-lock receiving systems, and\nhigh-power transmitters provide radio communications\nwith spacecraft. The DSSs and the deep space communications complexes (DSCCs) they comprise are given in\nTable 1.\nRadio contact with a spacecraft usually begins when\nthe spacecraft is on the launch vehicle at Cape Kennedy,\nand it is maintained throughout the mission. The early\npart of the trajectory is covered by selected net=.vork\nstations of the Air Force Eastern Test Range (AFETR)\nand the STDN of the Goddard Space Flight Center.\'\nNormally, two-way communications are established between the spacecraft and the DSN within 30 min after\nthe spacecraft has been injected into lunar, planetary, or\ninterplanetary flight. A compatibility test station at Cape\nKennedy (discussed later) tests and monitors the spacecraft continuously during the launch checkout phase. The\ndeep space phase begins with acquisition by 26-m DESs.\nThese and the remaining DSSs listed in Table 1 pmvide\nradio communications until the end of the mission.\n\n(5) DSN Test and Training System, Generates and\ncontrols\ndata to\nde,,elopment,\ntest, training and fault isolation within the DSN.\nwith flight\nParticipates in mission\nprojects.\n\nTo enable continuous radio contact v ith spacecraft, the\nDSSs are located approximately 120 deg apart in longitude; thus a spacecraft in deep space flight is always\nwithin the field-of-view of at least one DSS, and for\nseveral hou-s each day may be seen by two DSSs. Furthermore, since most spacecraft on dpep space missions\ntravel within 30 deg of the equatorial plane, the DSSs\nare located within latitudes of 45 deg north and south of\nthe equator. All DSSs operate at S-band frequencies:\n2110-2120 MHz for Earth-to-spacecraft transmission and\n2290-2300 hlHz for spacecraft-to-Earth transmission. An\nX-band capability is being readied for future missions\nbeginning in 1973.\n\nThe facilities needed to carry o:i; these ftinctions have\nevolved in three technical areas: (1) the Dcep Space Stations (DSSs) and the telecommunications interface\n\n\'The 9-m (No-ft) h m antema station established by the DSN on\nd\nAscension\nduring 1985 to act in ~c?Ljunction the STDN\nwith\norbital support 9-m ( m - f t ) ciiam antenna station was transferred\nto the STDN in July 1988.\n\n(4) DSN Monitor and Control System. Instruments,\ntransmits, records, a,id displays those parameters\nof the DSN necessary to verify configuration and\nvalidate the network. Provides operational direction and configuration control of the network and\nprimary interface with flight project Mission Control personnel.\n\n2\n\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1126. VOL. XIX\n\nTo provide sufficient tracking capability to enable\nreturns of useful data from around the planets and from\nthe edge of the solar system, a 64-m (210-ft) diam antenna\nsubnet will be required. Two additional 64-m (21U-ft)\ndiam antenna DSSs are under conFtruction at Madrid and\nCanberra and will operatc? in conjunction with DSS 14\nto provide this capability. These stations are scheduled to\nbe operational by the middle of 1973.\nB. CompatibilityTest Facilities\nIn 1959, a mobile L-band compatibility test station\nwas established at Cape Kennedy to verify flight-spacecraft/DSN compatibility prior to the launch of the Ranger\nand Manner \\. enus 1962 spacecraft. Experience revealed\nthe need for a permanent facility at Cape Kennedy for\nthis function. An S-band compatibility test station with a\n1.241 (4-ft) diameter antenna became operational in 1%.\nIn addition to supporting the preflight compatibility tests,\nthis station monitors the spacecraft continuously during\nthe launch phase until it passes over the locaI horizon.\nSpacecraft telecommunications compatibility in tl\ndesign and prototype development phases was formerly\nverified by tests at the Goldstone DSCC. To provide a\nmore economical means for conducting such work and\nbecause of the increasing use of multiple-mission telemetry and command equipment by the DSN, a Compatibility Test Area (CTA) was established qt JPL in 1968.\nIn all essential characteristics, the configuration of this\nfacility is identical to that of the 26-m (85-ft) and 64-m\n(210-ft) diameter antenna stations.\nThe JPL C T A is used during spacecraft system tests to\nestablish the compatibility with the DSN of the proof test\nmodel and development models of spacecraft, and the\nCape Kennedy compatibility test station is used for final\nflight spacecraft compatibility validation testing prior to\nlaunch.\n\nII. Ground Communications Facility\nThe GCF provides voice, high-speed data, wideband\ndata, and teletype communications between the Mission\nOperations Center and the DSSs. In providing these\ncapabilities, the GCF uses the facilities of the worldwide\nNASA Communications Network (NASCOM)*for all long\n*Managed and directed by the Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL RE#)RT 32.1526, V L XIX\nO\n\ndistance circuits, except those between the Mission\nOperations Center and the Goldstone DSCC. Communications between the Goldstone DSCC and the Mission\nOperations Center are provided by a microwave link\ndirectly leased by the DSN from a common carrier.\nEarly missions were supported by voice and teletype\ncircuits only, but increased data rates necessitated the\nuse of high-speed and wideband circuits for DSSs Data\nare transmitted to flight projects via the GCF using\nstandard GCF/NASCOM formats. The DSN also supports remote mission operations centers using the GCF/\nNASCOM interface.\n\n111. Network Control System\nThe DSN Network Control System is comprised of\nhardware, qoftware, and operations personnel to provide\ncentralized, real-time control of the DSN and to monitor\nand validate the network performance. These functions\nare provided during all phases of DSN support to flight\nprojects. The Network Ormations Control Arca is iocated\nin JPL Building 230, adjacent tc tLe locai iviissioii Clpwations Center. The NCS, in accomplishing the monitsr itlid\ncontrol function does not alter, delay, or serially process\nanv inbound or outbound data between the flight project\nand tracking stations. Hence NCS outages do not have a\ndirect impact on flight project support. Voice communications are maintained for nperations control and coordination between the DSN acd flight projects, and for\nminimization of the response time in locating and correcting system failures.\n"be NCS function will ultimately be performed in data\nprocessing equipment separate from flight project data\nprocessing and specifically dedicated to the NCS function. During FY 1973, however, DSN qperations control\nand monitor data will be processed in the JPL 360/75\nand in the 1108. In F 1974 the NCS data processing\nY\nfunction will be partly phased over to an interim NCS\nprocessor, and finally, in F 1975, the dedicated NCS\nY\ndata processing capability will be operational. The final\nNetwork Data Processing Area will be located remote\nfrom the Network Operations Control Area so 3s to provide a contingency operating location to minimize single\npoint of failure effects on the network control function.\nA preliminary description of the NCS appears elsewhere\nin this document.\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

XIX\n\nDSN Command System Mark 111-74\nW.\n\nG. Stinnett\n\nDSN Systems Engineering Office\n\nA general description is presented of the DSN Command Systew softwre\nchanges that are being implemented to support the Helios anti Viking m s i n .\nisos\nComparisons are mude between the present system (Mark 111-71) arid the new\nsystem (Mark 111-74). Included are the reasons for the changes, and the DSN plans\nto phase all mis.&n support ocer to the Mark 111-74 system.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe DSN Multiple Mission Command (MMC)Syatem has successfully supported the Mariner Mars 1971\n(MM71) mission and the Pioneer 10 mission to Jupiter.\nThe system is now supporting the ongoing Pioneer 10 mission, the Pioneer 11 mission to Jupiter, and the Mariner\nVenus/Mercury 1973 (MVM73) mission. All of these missions have been supported with the same DSN hardware.\n\nThe command software provided by the DSN in the\nDeep Space Stations\' (DSSs) telem. try and conimand\nprocessors (TCPs) has been basirally the same from mission to mission. The commant ! requirements for each\nmissin;: have been similar, and thus the software has remained basically the same as that designed for the MM71\nmission (heredftpr referred to as the CSN Mark 111-71\nCommand System).\nJPL TECHDilCAL RlEWR7\' 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nThe DSS TCP is an XDS 920 computer. The DSN implemented the DSS telemetry and command functims\ninto this computer for all the missions. One cf the primary\nproblems in implementing the command portion of the\nsoftware was timing. These timing problems had to be\novercame in the software used during the M r 111-71\nak\ne m All the misa;ons supported during this era required\nthe same transmission rate (1 bit/s\\; thus, the software\ntiming considerations were similar.\nThe DSN is presently implemmting significant changes\nin the DSN MMC System (the DSN Mark 111-74 Command System). The Helios and Viking mission command\ntransmission rates are 8 symbols per sycmd (SPS) and\n4 bitsis, respectively. The software timing considerations\nare significantly increased over tho.= missions supported\nduring the Mark 111-71 era. For this reason, the Comr nd\nSystem is undetgoing extensive software changes.\nI\n\nII. Mark Ill-74-Command System CI 2ges\nA. Transfer of System Functions\nThe increased command transmission rates from the\nhlark 111-71 to the Mark IIJ-74 e n have made it necessary\nto transfer some command functions from the DSS TCP\nto the llission Operations Center (XIOC). Figure 1 shows\na simplificd block diagram comparison of the hlark 111-71\nand thc Mark 111-74Command Systems. One of the prime\ntime-consuming functions provided by the TCP in the\n>lark 111-71 System was command stack manipulation. The TCP sortcd, arranged, and searched the cornmand stack frequently for thn \\lark 111-71 System. The\nMark 111-74 System has transfcrred these functions to\nthe XIOC.\n\nB. MOC Software Changes\nIn the Xlark 111-71 Command Slstem, the MOC software basically providcd a rcmote tcrminal capability to\n\nthe TCP. Under opcrator control, thc Bloc software generatcs high speed d:ita (HSD) blocks of command data.\nThe data arch transmitted to a DSS TCP, whew they are\nplaccd in the TCP command stack. A verification block is\nrcturneci. and the. MOC performs a bit-by-bit comparison with what was transmitted. Failurt to verify results\nin automatic retransmission of the command block. An\nenablc block is gcwmtccl. cithcr automatically after successful verification or under opwator contrd, and transmitted to thc DSS TCP. Again a verification block is\nrvturncd, anc! the MOT softwnrc performs a bit-by-bit\nwrification on thc enable block. After successful transmission of thc commmcl from the DSS to the spaewraft,\nthe TCP constructs a command confirmatian HSD mrssage and sends it to thr MOC. The hIOC softwire displays the coininand confirmation to thc, oprrator.\nla the. >lark 111-71 Commnrid Spsttom, the MOC S(\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x98iwart- provides dirwt controi of the conttwts of the TCP\n\ncommand stack. The .,perator cantrols the contents of the\ncommand q w u e in tile MOC. The MOC software then\ncan, via HSD nirssages, force thr TCP stack contents to be\nconsistent with the command qucui in the MOC. Under\noperator control, commands are entered into the command q w w . \\\\\xe2\x80\x99hen the operator cnablcs command5 in the\nqurue. the commands arc \xe2\x80\x9celigiblc\xe2\x80\x9d for transmission to\nthr DSS TCP. The cominands arc scwt to the DSS TCP\nand placed in the TCP pcr direction in thc HSD message.\nAn acknowlcdgc i.iessagc\xe2\x80\x99 is constructed Pt the TCP and\nsent to the MOC. The data are compared against the contents of the queue. Failurc to compare results in automatic\nretransmission to the TCP. After siiccessfril transmission\nof a command from the DSS to the spacecraf&, message\na\n6\n\nis sent from the TCP to the h4OC. The hlOC coniimes\nthis message with the contents of the queue. The command is then marked \xe2\x80\x9csuccessfully confirmed\xe2\x80\x9d and displayed to the operator.\nThe basic changes to the MOC software are the command queue concept and the ability to directly control\nthe contents of the TCP command stack.\nC. TCP Software Changes\n\nIn the Mark 111-71 Command System, the TCP sorts,\narranges, and searches the commands in the command\nstack. Upon receipt of comm,:rds from the MOC. the\nTCP software sorts priority and timed commands into\nhasically two stackb. Whcn enable message? aie received\nfrom the MOC, the TCP software is required to search\nthe complete stack to ensiire proper command enabling.\nWhen interrupts (every bit time) are received that tcll the\nsoftuare that the hardware is readv to transmit the next\ncommand, the complete stack is searched in an attempt to\nfind a command that is eligible (mabled and \xe2\x80\x99or timed)\nfor transmission.\nIn th, Mark 111-74 Command S - stem, the TCP software is no longer required to arrar,gf and s-vch the TCP\ncommand stack. The MOC software is rcquil.cd to kccn\nthe stack in logical order such that the TCT\xe2\x80\x99 lniy has to\n\xe2\x80\x9clook\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x98it the ton command in the stack. \xe2\x80\x98G1e T\xe2\x80\x98JP stack is\narranged into four modules and an arlive register. The\nstack is loaded by m o h l e via IISE block from the MOC.\nThe MOC software is required to keep thc stack modules\nupdated consistent with thc command queue in the XlOC.\nThe only command c4giblc for transmissioi. to the spacec:aft is the top command in the number onc module.\nNote that an enable message is no longer required from\nthe MOC. There are two types of commands in the\nlfark 111-74 ;ysterbi: (1) timed commands, and (2) nontimed commands. A nontimed command will he transmitted immediately when it ocmpies the top command in\nthe number one stack module. A timed mmmand will be\ntransmitted whrn the GMT reaches the command trans\nmit time and the command occupies the top command in\nthe number one stack module. R e command is transmitted to the spacecraft b y \xe2\x80\x9cmoving\xe2\x80\x9d it to the activc\nregister. LTpon successfill transmission of the commsncl\nfrom the DSS to the spacecraft a HSD message is <.onstruc:ed by the TCP arid sent to the MOC for notification\nof Confirmation.\nThe primary change t o the TCP software for the\nMark 111-74 System is the deletion of stack arranging\nand watching. T ; bas allowed the cspahility for the\nh.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nsoftware to peiform more important functions at the\nhigher command bit rates. The same types of hardware\nc e k provided at 1hit/s for the Mark 111-71System can\nhc\nbe provided for the Helios command rate of 8 SPS.\n\n111. Mark 111-74 Command SystemMission Support Plans\nIt is desirable from an operational and sustaining engineering viewpoint that all missions supported by the DSN\nbe supported by the Same DSN Command System. An\n\nJPL TECHNICAL R m T 32-1526, VOL XIX\nE R\n\'\n\noperational consideration is that two-system operation\ncan lead to confusion when different characteristics exist.\nAnother operational consideration is that personnel training is simplified when one system is used. The sustaining\nengineering consideration is, of course, less cost. For these\nreasons, the DSN plans to phase all mission support over\nto the Mark 111-74Command System. The present plans\nfor phase-over of all support is shown in Table 1. All\nmissions will be phased over after critical events are\ncomplete. The Hdios and , iking test periods and flight\n*\noperations will be supported entirely by the Ma;k 111-74\nCommand System.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nJPL TECHNlCAL\n\n32-lS2& VOL mt\n\nDss E W P Y ANiJCOMM*NDrtOCESSOII\n\nCOw,w.NM,\n\nCOMMAND S T X U\nT M D\n\nn 31 w\nK ( 1\n\nCMDl\nCMD2\n\nCMDl\nCUD2\n\nCMDN\n\nCMDN\n\nI\n\n.\n\nI ITO\n\nDSS E X C I T E ,\nWSMlTlB.\nt\n\nANTENNA\n\nSwsYslEMS\n\nCMD 6\n\nKKNOWZPDGI\n\nI\n\nI\nCQNFMTDN\n\nI\n\nCCMPAm T\nO\n\nIJe\n\nCOWARE T\nO\n\narrtn\n\nI\n\n9\n\nViking Mission Support\nD.

Unique Viking Requirements\n\nThe public-5on of the Sehvork Operations Plan for\nViking 19Z (Ref. 1) constitutes a further milestone marking the initial point at which the DSN operations personnel in general became directly involved with the\nYiking Project. This document interprets all the Project\nrequirc.ments levied on the Deep Spacc Network to support the \\\'ikina 1975 mission. It specifies the required\nhwian and technical interfaces a i d the maimer in which\nthe DSS capabilitie, described in the DSN Preparation\nPlan for Viking 1975 Projcct (Ref. 2), will be employcd hy\nSrhvork Operptions to support Viking pre-launch and\nflight opcrations activities. Finally. this constitutes the\nprim(. refrrcwce regarding the Viking DSN training, trsting. configurations, procedures, and operations, for all\nprsonncl in the DSS Operations Ofc.\nfie\n\nIn pre\\<ous missions, during the limited critical and/or\nestremely high-activity periods, the requirement for hardware failure backup has been met at the Deep Space\nStations by scheduling a second station in parallel and/\nor the use of complete parallel strings of equipment\nreadied in a "standby" state.\n\n10\n\nThe Viking 1975 mission is unique in this respect in\nthat: (1) the critical/high-activity periods will estend for\nup to 5 months continuously, ( 3 )three DSSs 21 each loation will be required for 2 months, 7 days I r week (EO\nbackup stations) (see Fig. l),and (3) \'he 5-month period\nrequires the simultaneous use of six rlemetry l-:.rdware\nstrings out of a total station complement of six strings\n(no backup strings) at each 61-m-antenna DSS.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, YOL \'IX\n\n111.

During planetary oprations,\ntlic conjoint LB-n~DSS (or DSS 11 at Goldstone) would\nnornizlly be schcdulcd to support in parallel to supply\nthe s t a n d uplin:<. At DSSs 43 and 6;3. the rectlivcr output (subcarrier plus data) is hardwired to the SDA at\nDSS 12 or 61, and the SD.4 output is hardwired back to\nthe 64-nj SS.4. At DSS 11/11, t h t w functions are carried\nout via a microwave link.\n\nRandom Landcr orientation\n\nVII. Rationale for Implementationof 1OO-kW\nTransmitter Capability at DSSs 43 and 63\nThe DSN response to the Viking requirement for\nIWkW transmit capability at the overseas DSSs (Ref. 3,\np. 2300.2) i s given in the N.4S.4 Support Plan (Ref. 4,\np 430.1) as follows; -. . .at DSSs 4 ai-d 63,100 h-v trans3\nmitter \\vi11 provide dual links at 10 kw each.\xe2\x80\x9d .4t the\ntime this was written, the requirement and its response\nwere principally oriented toward the need for simultaneous commanding from a single station to two spacecraft\n(Orhiter/Orbiter or Orbiter,\xe2\x80\x99Lander).\nEarly in 1973. the Tracking and Data System met with\nthe Project and indicated that the dualcarrier, sinsletransmitter mode of operation presented technical problems w!rich were not fully understood and recommended\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9cdual-carrier\xe2\x80\x9d mode be considered as a \xe2\x80\x9cinission\ncnhancement\xe2\x80\x9d feature o d y in all future mission plaming.\nThe prime missioii mode \\vas to be based on the use of\ntwo subnrts, with the simultaneous command requirement being met with two stations, i.e., a 64-m and a 26-m\nDSS at cwh longitudr. This decision is reported ii; Ref. 5.\n\nIn preparing thc FYT4fiT5 budget, it was proposed that\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cmission enhancement* feature of Viking support be\ndropped by dciferring the 10O-kW transmitters to a postViking era.\nEvaluation of the consequent impact on the Viking\nmission planning and flight support showed that, irrespective of the dual-carrier requirement, there remained a\nnrcd for a lW-kW transmit capability at DSSs 43 and\n6\xe2\x80\x983, as wrll as thc 400-kW transmit capability at DSS 14,\nto avoid unaccrptable risks and/or constraints to Viking\nLander operations (Mission B particularly) due to any\nof the following causes:\n12\n\n.idvcmch landing slopes (20deg;\n\nHigh-gain antenna or computer malfunction\nSoutherly landing sites (:3O\xe2\x80\x99Si\nSeed for real-time retargetin? of 1ai;ding site\nLate launch in the secondary mission\nThe dominant factor influencing all of the foregoing\neffects is the most recent Lander low-gain antenna patterns measured on a %-scale model. These patterns show\nsevere distortion due to adjaccnt hardware on the Lander\nstructure, which results in large negative gain over\nsubstantial portions of the antenna field of view. Most\nof the conditions described above could result in Earth\nlook vectors which lie in these negative gain areas, and\nhence require a high-power transmit capability to m m pensate for the antenna gain deficiencies.\nTypical low-gain antenna radiation patterns discussed\nabove were analyzed at gain levels of -3 and - 10 dR.\nThew are the levels required to support the command\nlink for 10- and 1oO-kjV transmitters. This analysis is\nsummarized in Fia. 6, which s h o w the Lander cone and\nclock angle regions where the low-gain antcnna covcrage\nis adequate to support the command link.\nThe history of the look vector to Earth as s e w from\nthe Lander for a .30cS latitude landing site is also shown\nin Fig. 6. The dashed line represents the nominal Earth\ntrack as seen from the Lander early in the mission. Time\nticks arc located on the nominal track to provide a relative\ntime reference. The envelope about the nominal track\nconsiders a r20-deg adverse surface slope, $20 deg uncertainty in he landed azimuth of Lander leg 1, and the\nworst case relative Earth/Mars geometry over the W-day\n1andc.d mission.\nThe shaded nreas within the Earth track envelope\nreprcasent those areas where the Lander antenna gain is\nnot sufficient to support the command link with a lW-k\\V\ntransmitter. The area which lies between the shaded\ncontour and the upper contour line is that Lander cone/\nclock angle region where command capability exists with\na 100-kW transmitter but not with 20 k W . Command\ncapability exists with a 20-kW transmitter for the Lander\ncone/clock angle region above the second contour.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL XIX\n\nOb\\iously, the opportunity to command the Lander\nover the low-gain antenn:? is w.~:.!:..:;cliittd ior the 30-S\n\nlatitude landing site. Only one half of the total daily Earth\nview period is available for Landcr command with a\n?O-k\\V transmitter.\nThe command link performance for this same set of\nconditons (30\xe2\x80\x98s latitude) is given in Fig. 7 for no-slope\nconditions and in Fig. 8 for 3 - d e g slope conditions.\nIn Fig. 7, the perforinam.- is shown for the time of day\nwhen Earth has risen to a 15-deg elevation angle above\nthe local horizon. No adverse slop- is considered. .4t this\ntime of day, the Lander cone ansle d the look vector to\nEarth is 105 deg, or conversely, the a s p c i .male of Earth\nas seen from the Lander antenna boresight i s is leg.\nThe c u n r labeled \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d \\vas generated from the\nfree space Lander gain pattern at an aspect angle of\n75 deg. This cun-e shows a margin of approximately 3 dB\nabove that required with 20 kW of transmitter power.\nThe bcs: and worst curves were developed from the\ninstalled %-scale model antema pattern data as follows:\nThe curve labeled \xe2\x80\x9dbest\xe2\x80\x9d was derived from the highest\nLander gain found on the installed patterns at an aspect\nangle of 75 deg. Because of the uncertainty in the landed\nLander azimuth orientation and the desire to place no\nfurther constraint on the time of day at which a command\nsession can occur, the entire Lander clock angle region\n( ; 6 deg) was considered.\na30\n\nThcb c\xe2\x80\x98iirvch labclcd \xe2\x80\x9c\\\\.orst\xe2\x80\x9d \\viis dcrivvd :is c.ipl?ined\nabw.~..\nexcept that the lowest Landcr 9,iin at ;in :ispect\n\xe2\x80\x990\n1\nanqle of 7.5 deg over the total clock angle re&\xe2\x80\x9911 \\vas\nconsidered.\n\nFigure S rcflects the s a ~ n c\nconditions as dcfined for\nFig. 7, except thdt a 20-deg adverse surface slope \\vas\nc o n s i d c d .

Subsystem\nclesign, sy.ptem design, and system wrification tests were paformed at JPL and\nCape CmiceroI.

Introdwtian\nThe initial etforts to establish DSNlMVM73 Spacecraft compatibility consisted of an intensive series of tests\nto determine the Tplemetry and Command Data Handling (TCD) Subsystem performance for MVM73 telemetry modes, The tests were performed in late 1971 at the\nCompatibility Test Station (DSS71), the Compatibility\nTest Area (CTA 211, and the Telemetry Development\nLaboratory (TDL)\nutilizing telemetry simulators and test\nsoftware.\n\nPreliminary design tests utilizing MVM73 Spacecraft\ncomponents were perfomtd at CTA 21 and TDL during\nthe early part of 1979.These tests were accomplished with\nTCD software that consisted of modified Manner M r\nas\n1971 (MM?I) operational software and revised TCD test\nsoftware.\nPhase I of a threc-phase test program to establish DSN/\nMVM\xe2\x80\x9d73 Spacecraft compatibility was performed with\nCTA 21 and TDL starting in September, 1972.

Command and telemetry tests. Formal compatibility\ntesting was changed to informal software checkout and\ndevelopment testing status. This action was the result of\ndelays in acceptance testing of the operational software,\nand was performed over the time period April through\nJuly 1973. Several problems with the software were discovered. Most of these problems were related to the inability to acquire 8 5 bitsis at high signal conditions. O\nf\nlesser significancewas loss of TCD program control when\nselecting a redundant Subcamer Demodulator Assembly\n(SD.4) or initialization of 490 bits s.\n\nHardware problcms uncovered were a possible alignment problem with the SDA and an interference problem\nusing the discrete spectrum from the Planetary Ranging\nAssembly (PRA). With the former problem, one of the\ntwo SD.4s at CTA 21 would not acquire at the projectspecified Jfcwtiry cncounter tclemctry threshold STI, N,,\n(0.63 dB).\n\nA special alignment of the SDA was considered to be\na resolution to the problem. With the latter problem, the\ntelemetry signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimators in both\ntelemetry channels (22.0512.45 kilobits/s) indicated an\nincrcasr in SNR with the PRA discrete spectrum ranging\nas opposed to the Mark I-A continuous ranging.\nJ P l TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, YOL.

Testing was conducted at various sun levels to\nsimulate: (1) 1.0 Sun, (2) 2.0 Sun, (3) 4.8 Sun, and (4) Ambient. Several problem areas were uncovered and are\nlisted below :\n(11 The SD.4 lock indicator would not indicate in-lock\nat threshold, 5 X lo-? data bit error rate (BEH), fcr\n\n93 kilobits s, block coded data.\n( 9 ) For some SDA Symbol Synchronizer Assembly\n(SSA) combinations, insufficient SDA correlation\nvoltage was achieved for 22 kilobits \xe2\x80\x98s block coded\n\ndata to achieve SSA lock.\n\n(3) The Mission and Test Computer (MTC) eqxrie n d difficulty in achieving frame sync at threshold\nfor 32 kilo bits;^, block coded data.\n(4) The operational software (DSN Program Libra?\n\nSoftware No. (DOIsojo-OP) would not achieve\nrehble bit sync lock for 8% hits/s at high signal\nlevel conditions.\nThese problems werc not resolved during the July 1973\ntesting at C T A 21, but were given high priority for continued investigation during the Flight No. 1 testing to be\nconducted at DCC71. All other objectives of the test plan\nfor Flight No. 2 spacecraft were successfiilly completed\nduring this phase.\n\nC. Phase 111 Tests\n1. Flight No. 1 compatibility verification tests. This\ntesting was performed at Cape Caiiaveral on August 26,\n1973. The spacecraft was located in Building A 0 2nd an\nR F link was established to DSS 71; however, Revision A\nof the operational TCD software was not abdilable. Special emphasis was placed on problems uncovered at\nC T A 21 during Flight No. 2 testing. A summary of the\ntrsting and results is as follows:\n\n(1) Command: the DSK Spacvcraft command system\ndesign was declared compatible. There were no\noutstanding problems remaining upon completion\nof this testing.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nRanging: an interference problem in the telemetry\nsignal-to-noise estimator ocuurred when the PRt\\\ndiscrete code was applied to the up-link. This problem was manifested by higher-than-normal S S R\nprintouts. An operational resolution o this conif\npatibility problem was to operate the uplink R F\nsignal at or \xe2\x80\x99below - 100-dB signal levels.\n\nR F tests: all R F tests were successfully completed\nand compatibility was declared satisfactory.\n\n2 Flight No. 2 compatibility verification tests. This test\nwas performed on September 22 and October 23, 1973 at\nCape Canaveral. The spacecraft was located in Ruilding A 0 for the September 23 test, and Launch Complex 36 for the October 23 test. All testing was performed\nvia an RF link and the launch version (Revision A) of the\nTCD operational software was utilized successfiilly.\nTests pwformed on September 22, 1973 cleared an outstanding compatibility problem. For the first time, a video\npicture was sent from the spawcraft to MTC and fully\nreconstructed. Data rate for this event was 22 kilobits./s.\nblock coded. The X26X software module was also successfully exercised during this test. ,411 other objectives of\ntesting on this date were successfully completed.\nFollowing completion of these tests. an operational\nreadiness revitw was held on September 26, 1973 with a\nreport of compatibility status as follows:\n\n(I) Command design compatibility established.\n(2) Telemetry daign compatibility established with\nadditional testing of DOI-5050-OP-Ascheduled for\nOctober 23, 1973.\n\n(3) RF design compatibility es*ablished.\n27\n\n(4) Ranging design compatibility established with\n\nadditional operational testing scheduled for October 23,1973.\n\non October 23, 1973,final compatibi!ity testing was\nconducted with tlie Flight No. 2 sp&craft encaprilated\nin its launch configuration and located at Launch Complex 3 .All cwmpatibility deficiencies encountered during\n6\nthe September 22, 1973 testing were resolved. Therefore,\ncomplete compatibility was established for all elements of\ntho Spacecraft DSN interface.\n\n111. Conclusions\nThe successful conclusion of the foxmal DSN/MVM\xe2\x80\x99T3\ncompatibility program enabicd the establishment of telecommunications compatibility as evidenced by the successful launch of the 51VW73 spacrcraft on November 3,\n\n1973.\nThe importance of the performance of a formal mmpatibility test program is clearly demonstrated hv the\nproblem areas uncovered, verified. and resolved during\nthe DSN 51VM73 testing.\n\nReference\n1.

Thz objective bf these\nexperiments ~LIQSto determine the position of Mars in the VLBI rcfmence frame.\nThis first of tuw articles gives background and describes experimental procedures.\nA subsequent article udl describe the analysis of the data and the result obtained\nfor the differential position.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe technique of very long baseline interferometry,\npresently under rapid development, holds promise of making important contributions to spacecraft navigation.\nThrough VLRI observations of extragalactic radio sources,\nmany of them quasars, it will be possible to determine\nEarths orientation (UTI and polar motion) accurately\nwith respect to the inertial framr formed by these sources.\nOur expectation is that within the next 5 years VLBI will\nbe ablr to provide, for example, measurements of UTI\nroutinely with uncertainty below the 1-ms level, which\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nprojects to a position error of about 10 km at a g-wentric\ndietance of 1 AU (still by no means the theoretical limit of\nthe technology). In order to utilize this accuracy for interplanetary spacecraft navigation, we must know the orientation of the planetary system with iespect to the same\ninertial frame. Since the planets are not themselves suitable targets for VLBI observations, an indirect approach\nis necessary. It was therefore suggested by one of us\n(I.I.S.) that a spacecraft in orbit about another planet\nwould be an appropriate target.\n31\n\nIn bricf, the prccrliure prop0sC.d \\vas to utilizc in.9 c?f\nthe DSN antennas to observe alternately, but in synchronism, the spacecraft and an estragnlactic radio source that\nlies nearby in the sky. with sufficiently stable frequency\nstandards and adequate signal-to-noise ratios, it is possible\nto switch back and forth bet\\vtvn observations of the\nspacecraft and the natural radio source\' so a s to be able to\ndetermint, the time development of the fringe phase for\neach target without the introduction of any 2- ambiguities\nother than the initial one that affects all such observations.\nThe differences in the fringe phases for the two targets\nrepresent extremely accurate observiibles sinct. they are\nfreed, through cancellation, from most instrumental effects. Because the two sources, by drsign. subtend a very\nsmall angle at Earth, the propagation-medium effects tend\nto cancel as well. This txhnique of differential VLBI\n(AVLRI: appears capable, when developed, of the determination of relative positions with an uncertainty at the\nmilliarcsecond level. (Also see Ref. 1.:\n\nThe first opportunity to apply this technique arose with\nthe Mariner 9 spacecraft in January 1972. During this\nprimary portion of the mission, several sets of observations\nwere conducted. Other observations were carried out during the extended mission. Unfortunately. the required first\nlocal oscillator (LO) signal could not be derived from the\nstation frequency standards by integer multiplication hecause of the lack of appropriate instrumentation. Therefore, the first LO chain was driven by a synthesizer signal\nand, as a consequence, sufficient frequency stability with\nthe interferometer was not obtained to allow the fringe\nphase to be \xe2\x80\x9cconnected between observations of either of\nthe two targets without the introduction of 27 ambiguities.\xe2\x80\x99 Therefore, only the fringe rates, which are inherently\nunambiguous although less accurate, were available for\n:he determination of relative position. A detailed description of these experiments is given in the followhg sections;\nthe results will be discussed in the final article of this\ntwo-part series.\n\nII. Experiment Description\nInitially, three sets of observations were taken on\nJanuary 17, ?O, and 25, 1972, during mutual visibility between the 84-m hlars antenna (DSS 14) at Goldstme, California, and a 26-m antenna at \\Yoomera, Australia (DSS\n41). The natural soiirce which was observed alternately\n\xe2\x80\x98Had four antennas been availahle (a pair at each end of the long\nbaseline), observations of each target muld have been carried out\ncontinuously, and this lack of frequency st;bility woull have been\nof no consequence (provided the same local oscillator signal was\nused at each antenna pair).\n\n32\n\n-\n\nwith Mariner 9 \\va> the quasar PO106 01.

Introduction\nIn the last few years, there has been increasing interest\nin developing a system capable of accurately measuring\nthe relative motion of points separated by distances rmging from 100 Inn up to intercontinental distances on the\nEarths crust. Information concerning this far-field motion\nis of critical importance in the development c,f theoretical\nmodels of crustal dynamics. Since crustal motion is about\n3-10 cm/year, the measurement accuracy should be about\n1-3 cm with about 1 week of data. Radio interferometry is\none technique that holds great promise for fulfilling tnis\naccuracy requirement.\n34\n\nIn order to begin devehpment of a radio system with\nfew-centimeter accuracy, a series of interferometry experinrents has been canducted between two mtennas at the\nGoldstone Deep Space Communications Ccmplex. The\nprimary objective of these experiments was to develop\nindependent-station instnimentation capable of making\nthree-dimensional baseline measurements with an accuracy of a few centimeters. A short Goldstme baseline\n(16 km betweea D S 12 and D S 14) was selected so that\nS\nS\ntransmirsion media uncertainties and astronomical parameters would be relatively unimportant compared with\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 3 . 1 6 VOL. x1X\n212.\n\nradio system limitations. These experiments I d to the\nrefinement of a two-channel approach to bandwidth synthesis, a technique for measuring time delay that was\noriginally developed by A. E. E. Rogers (Ref. 1).

Radio Interferometer Technique\n\n4.T\n\nIn the radio interferometry rneasurq-nents d.scribed in\nthis report, two antennas simultaneously receive the radio\nnoise generated by an extragalactic radio source,as shown\nin Fig. 1. Because of a difference in ray paths, a given\nwave front will reach the two antennas at diflerent times.\nT i difftrence in arrival times is called the time delay T .\nhs\nIn this section, the technique for the measurement of this\ndelay is described, while a mathematical model for this\nquantity is discussed in Sectioir 1V.\nSince the radio interferometry method has been analyzed in detail in other papers (Refs. la), will be\nit\ndescribed only briefly in this report. Single-channel interferometry will be reviewed first. followed by an outline of\ntwo-channel bandwidth synthesis.\n\nIn single-channel measurements, each antenna system\nrecords on magnetic tape radio noise centered at fre\nquency with bandwidth W,. t q x s are then carried\nThe\nto a central site for Agital processing.

Experiment Description\nOver the last two years, five separate radio interferometry experiments. which arc siimniarizd in Table I. have\nbeen conducted behvwn DSS 12 and DSS 11 at the\nGoldstone Deep Space Communications Complcs. All\nexperiments invoIved S-band observations. JPL H-maser\nfrequency standards. aid a 44-kHz bandwidth digital\nrecording system developed by D. S. Robertson and\nA. H. Legg of the \\Veapons Research Establishment.\nAustralia. As indicated in Table 1, the various esperimrnts were behvwn iand 14 hours in duration and\ninvo:vcd 13 to 18 radio sources. The sources u s e d in the\nlast four experiments are described in Table 5.\nIn the first Goldstone rsperinient (Ref. &), one narrowband (24-kNz bandwidth\' channel of radio noise \\\\-as\nrecorded, s that only the fringe frequency observable\no\nwss precisely obtained. An analysis of the resulting frequency obsen-ables reveal4 frequency instability at the\n1-mHz level ( J , \' f\n5 X lo-\'?)over severa! hours. \'4s\nindicated iii Ref. 2. the HP5100 synthesizers associated\nwith the first lwd oscillator (LO) signal were the most\nlikely source of this instability. Consequently. in subseiuent experiments. the synthesizers \\vert\' replaced by\nmore stable X7 multip\'iers. which will be described below.\nAfter this first experiment. instrumentation was also\ndeveloped to measure time delay in addition to fringe freqtiency. The technique adopted for delay measurements\nrequired the measurement of more than one channel of\nradin noise. This technique. commonly called bandwidth\nsynthesis (Refs. 1 and 5). comhines, either directly or\nindirectly. the fringe phase information of band-limited\nchannels record4 at frequencies whose separations are\nlargc. compared to that of the siiiglr-channel bandwidth.\n\nIn thc original application of thc bandwidth synthesis\ntechnique (Ref. 1). six channels wcre recorded in a timeshared mode. Howrver, because of signal-to-rloisc ratio\n(SXR improvement and simplification of instrumentation, w c employed instrumrntation that recorded only\ntwo channck Thr only disadvantage of the two-channel\nsystvm is that sufficiently prccisc Q priori delay information is requirrd to avoid 2- ambiguities (Ref. 5). Since\ndelay measuremcnt prwisinn improves as channel separation incrrases. the gcal of the instrumental design was to\nobtain maximum channcl separation within the resticJPL TECHNICAL R E M 32.1526, Y L XIX\nO\n\ntions of the DSK antenna systems. In the final system, the\nmaximum separation \\vas defined by the limits of the\ntraveling wave maser ("IVM, receiver bandpass.\nFor the second experiment, a relatively simplc instrumental configuration was de\\-ised to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the two-channel approach to bandwidth\nsynthesis. In this intermcdiatc. system, which will not bt.\ndescrild here in detail, two channels separated by\n10 JlHz at S-band were heterodyned to intermediate frcqiicncy (IF? and added. This combined sign,al was then\nheterodyned to baseband and continuously samplcbd at a\n1 6 - k i l d d s rutc.. \\Vhile this system pays a price in SNR,\nit avoids the complications of simultaneous rcyorder channel switching at the two stations. This internicdiatr instrumentation demonstrated the feasibility of tlie t\\vo-char~ncI\napproach and hvlped pcrfect the final instniiwntation\ndescribed helob:.\nThc final canfiguration u s e d for bandwidth synthesis is\nshown in Fig. 5. In this system. ;i 10-blHz signal from the\n\nH-maser is converted to a 340-1\\IHz first LO signal by\nusing only multipliers-the standard S1S8 multipliers of\nthe DSK system and a new X multiplier. This S7 multii\nplier, which was constructed\' to a\\.oid the use of a synthesizer, convt-rts the input sinusoid to a square wave, then\nfiltcrs and amplifir; the scvcnth harmonic.\nIn order to achic.ve masinirim channel separation and\nbetter delay prtrision. thc S-hand trawling wave m:iser\nreceiver bandpass \\vas broadewd by retuning the trim\ncoil currents.

Time Delay Model\nThc residual delay AT observed in radio interferometry\nmeasiirements is a sum of geometric, instrumental, and\ntransmission media drlays, as indicated in Eq. (6). This\nsection outlines the model adopted for these terms in the\nobserved delay, starting with :he largest and most important term, the geometric delay.\n\nAs indicated in Fig. 1, a given wave front will reach the\ntwo antennas of the interferometer at daerent times. It is\nreadily shown that the geometric delay is given by the\nexpression (Ref. 3)\n\n(7\xe2\x80\x99)\nwhere B is the baseline vector between the two antennas,\nS is the apparent source direction, V2 is the velocity of\nantenna 2, and c is the speed of light. Note that the geometric delay is essentially the instantaneous geometric\npath dilference multiplied by a small correction that\naccounts for the motion of antenna 2 diiring the wave\ntransit.\nIn the present analysis, tnie equatorial coordinates of\ndate (TECD) are chosen as the coordinate frame for geometric delay calculations. In this Earth-centered righthanded frame, the z-axis is along the instantaneous spin\naxis of Earth while the x-axis is along the tnie equiyx of\ndate. The source vector B and the baseline vector S can\nbe expressed in terms of these coordinates as follows.\nIn TECD, the source vector S is usually characterized\nby two angles-apparent declinations 6 and apparent\n.\nright ascendon a,. These angles lead to the usual expression for the source vector:\n\nThe baseline vector B must include two general features: an Earth-fixed definition and Earth orientation factors. The Earth-fixed vector, B,,:.is defined in t w n s of a\nright-handed coordinate frame with a z-axis townrd the\nConventional International Origin (CIOI pole and X-axis\nalong the Greenwich meridian. It will be represented in\nCartesian m r d i w t e s as follows:\n\nwhere xb.tJ( are the equatorial components and z b is the\n:-component. as schematically indicated in Fig. 1.\nA t this point in the discussion of the baseline vector. a\ndefinition of antenna location is desirable. The effective\nlocation of an antenna depends on antenna structure.\nMost directional antennas ha\\-(, two primary axes of\nrotation that allow antenna orientation. For DSS 14, an\nazimuth /elevation antenna, the rotation axes intersect.\nBy geometrical considerations, one can show that this\npoint of intersection is the efftbctive antenna location.\n\nOn the other hand, DSS 12 is a polar mount. for which\nthe rotation axes are nonintersecting. In this case, the\neffective location is the point at which the hour-angle\naxis orthogonally intersects a plane containing the declination axis. Thercfore, for this polar mol. t, one must\ninclude the correction factor b cos 6 , in delay calculations,\nwhere b is the shortest distance between the twc axes.\nThis correction factor acroiinh for the fact that this type\nof antenna \xe2\x80\x9cstretches toward low-declination objects. For\nDSS 12, the axis separdtion b is 6.706 m and is easily\naccounted for with adequate precision.\nThe baseline vector B rotates in space as R result of\npolar motion and EartL spin. To account for those motions, the Earth-fixed baseline vector is rotated to its\ninstantaneoris orientation in \xe2\x80\x98TECD a b follows:\n\nwhere the Earth spin matrix is given by the expression\n\nA\n\nS = (cos 8 , cos a*, 8, sin a*, 8,)\ncos\nsin\n\n(8)\n\nThe term \xe2\x80\x9capparent\xe2\x80\x9d indicates the presence of a correction to the source direction that accounts for aberration\ndiie to the Earth\xe2\x80\x98s orbital motion (Refs. 3 and 71.

Parameters X, and Y are the\n,\npolar displacements relative to the CIO pole, while a is\nthe polar radius. See Ref. 3 for more detail concerning\nthese Earth orientation factors.\nA\n\nThe expressions above for B and S are easily combined\nto calculate the geometric delay for a given source. It\nshould be noted that the model for the geometric delay\noutlined above neglects general relativistic effects which,\nfor longer ha3elines, may he significant.\nIn these experiments, no corrwtions were made for\nionospheric effects. In all the measurements reported here.\nradio sources werc observed at night when ionospheric\ndelays, inhomogeneities, and turbulence were at a minimum. ,4t S-band, the nighttime ionosphere causes about\na 1-m dclay along a single ray path at a typical elevation angle ( ~ 3 dtg). However, the diference in iono0\nspheric delays along the two iuterferometer ray paths\nis the important quantity in dclay measuremerlts. Since\nnighttime observations involve a relatively homogeneous\nionosphere, this difference for a 16-km baseline will be a\nsmall fraction of a single ray-path delay. As we shall see,\nthe delay residuals in the present experiments stronglv\nindicate that differential ionosphere delays were less than\n6 cm. Below the 6-cm level, differential ionosphere corrections, even if they were available, would be of marginal\nvalue in the present delay measurements. However, as\ndiscussed in Section \\-I, the frequency residuals contain\nan unmodeled noise term at the 0.1-mHz level that could\npossibly be an ionospheric effect.\nThe total troposphere delay for a single ray path is\nribout 4 m for a typical elevation angle. In the present\nwork, small corrections are made to the delay observables\nto remove small known differences ( 515 cm) in tropospheric delays along the two ray paths. These differences\nare a consequence of Earth curvature as well as a slight\naltitude difference (40m) between the two antennas. The\naltitude difference produces a 1-cm difference in the \xe2\x80\x9ddry\xe2\x80\x9d\ncomponent of the zenith tropospheric delay. The Earth\xe2\x80\x98s\ncurvature leads to elevation angle differences that cause\ndifferentialtroposphere corrections as large as 10 cm. It is\nbelieved that, with these CorrecFnns, the differential \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d\ntroposphere delay becomes a negligible source of error.\nThe total \xe2\x80\x9cwet\xe2\x80\x9d troposphere delay for one ray path at\nGoldstone is mly 1&20 centimeters at typical elevation\nangles. For a 16-km baseline with only small changes in\naltitlide, the difference in the wet troposphere between\nray paths should be only a small fraction (<lo$) of the\nJPL TECHNICAL REWRT 3 . 21\n\nXIX\n\nsingle ray path delay. It is estimated that. with the listed\ncorrections, the total troposphere effect in the delay observable becomes a negligible source of error (5 cm).\n3\nFinally, with regard to the present instrumentation,\ntlie instrumental terms (T,, - <b) in the measured delay\n(Eq. 6) can be adequately .*(>deled a constant plus\nas\na linear drift, where the constant and slope are used as\nsolve-for parameters.\n\nV. Fitting Procedure\nAs outlined in Section 11, the reduction of each tapepair gives the residual delay AT and fringe frequency a v\nfor a particular radio source observed for a 12-min interval. In order to extiact the baseline vector, the delay\nand frequency values from many tape-pairs recorded for\nmany radio sources must be sirnultaneoiisly fit by a leastsquares technique using a model for the delay. The construction of a mathematical model for the geometric delay was outlined in Section IV.This section outlines the\nwcighted least-squares fitting procediire used to extract\nthe Goldstone baseline.\n\nIn these short-baseline measurements, uncertainties in\nthe geometric delay due to errors in source location and\nEarth orientation factors (polar motion, UT1, precession,\nnutation) are small compared with instrumental errors.\nThat is, all of these factors have been measured with sufficient accuracy by other methods so that they mav be\ntreated as \xe2\x80\x9cknown\xe2\x80\x9d quantities in delay calculations. For\nthe radio sources in these experiments, source locations\nhave been independently measured with an accuracy of\n0:u).9 Y-c seconds, as indicated in Table 2. The position errors in this table represent approximate external\naccuracy, conservatively estimated in some cases by\nroot-sum-squaring the quoted internal errors with 0.3 arc\nsecond. The adequacy of these measurements can be\ndemonstrated by the following approximnte calculation.\nA typical value for the sensitivity partials in the presmt\nexperiments is approximately 0.1 ns/arc second. When\nthis sensitivity is multiplied by a typical source location\nerror of about 0.5 arc second, a delay error equal to 0.05 ns\n(1.5 ;.m) results. This delay error is small compared with\na typical system noise error of about 7 cm. Similar detailed\ncalculations for all sources in Table 2 indicate that these\nsource positions are adequate for present delay modrl calculations. By similar arguments, one can show that polar\nmotion and UT1, which are known with about 0.03 arc\nsecond accuracy (Ref. 9), also contribute negligible errors\nin delay calculations. The BIH values fo. UT1 - UTC\nand polar motion parameters are listed in Table 3. Finally,\n41\n\nlays are assumed to be a negligible source of error after\nsmall tropospheric corrections. Thus, there are six solvefor parameters in the fitting procedurc: &tb, Ayb, &b, r,,\n\nknown crrors in thc models for precession and nutaEon of\nthe Earths spin axis contribute errors less than 0.2 arc second (Ref. 8). and may be regarded as negligible. Therefor<.. only the three baseline parameters must be regarded\nas solve-for parameters in the geometric delay.\n\nT*.\n\n1\'8-\n\nExtra frequency noise, which is discussed in Section VI,\nreduced the strength of the fringe frequency observables.\nNormally, if only system noise i s present, each channel\ncontributes a statistically independent measure of fringe\nfrequency. The extra frequency noise in the present experiment was almost perfectly correlated between channels.\nThis correlation meant, in effect, that the two channels\nproduced only one independent fringe frequency measurement for each tape-pair.\n\nIn addition to the gcwmetric delay parameters, the observed delay contains unknown offset and linear drift\nterms which are equivalent in effect to a synchronization\nerror and rate difference between clocks. The linear drift\nis due mainly to a small uncalibrated rate difference bet\\vc.en tlir H-maser frcqucncy standards. In the fringe\nfrtquenry observable-. thc, rate difference becomes a constant frequency offset. In principle, thca frequency offset\nand the dc-lay rate offset shoiild he equal. However, as\nwill bc shown, the fringy frequency observable contains\nextra noise considrrahly above the expected system noise.\n111 addition. the frrquency obs(m&lcb contains elements\nof the frequency system that cancel in the delay observable. For these reasons. the two rate factors are varied\nindependently in the fit so that the frequency offset can\nfreely s t ~ k owi level without coupling in a corrupting\nits\nfashion with the delay obsen-able. However, comparison\nof thc two rate offsets is one means of judging the quality\nof these measurcments.\n\nIn order to simultaneouslv fit the delay and frequency\nobservables, the f t i g equations (Eq. and 14) are more\nitn\n13\nconveniently expressed in the following form:\nu=Ap\nwhere\n\nL\'nder thcsc assumptions, the complete models? for the\nresidrinl dclay and fringe frequency ohservables become\n\nand\n\\vhcre AT,.

The system noise contribution to each\nobservable was calculated by a covariance analysis based\non amplitude noise on the fringes. (The fringe signal-tonoise ratio in this experiment is determined primarily by\nthe usual factors: system noise temperature, correlated\nflux. and bit count per fringe point.) The frequency standard noise terms were assigned the following values baspd\non typical JPL hydrogen maser stability ( ~ f /zz 1O-l\'). In\nf\nthe frequency domain, expected H-maser frequency noise\nis about 23 pHz at S-band for 700-s integration times. In\nthe time domain, the effective delay (phase) noise introduced by the oscillators is estimated to he about 0.08 ns\nfor 8 h of data. This delay noise rstimntv is considerably\nbelow the standard estimate (AT, 10.\'\' X 8 h 0.3 11s)\nbecause of tlw least-squares fitting procedure. That is, the\ndelay off set and linear drift parameters contained in the\nfit absorb most of the delay excursions due to H-m::.s:.instability.\n\n1\n\nAfter a given fit, the best estimate of the fit function is\ngiven by\n\n\\\n\\\n\nA\n\nO\n\nIn the absence of a ptiori in nnation concerning the\nmodel parameters, the vector is the best estimate of the\nsolve-for parameters.

In this solution, it is assumed that\nthe noise on a given observable is uncorrelated with the\nnoise on any other observable, so that the off-diagonal\nelements of W are zero. For the present experiments, this\nassumption can be partially justified as follows. Delay and\nfrequency observables are uncorrelated since, as revealed\nb y the fits, the dominant uncertainty in delay is system\nnoise, while in the frequency observab!e, the dominant\nuncertainty is due to some unmodeled noise source, probably unpredictable ionospheric variations. The observables obtained from different tape-pairs are uncorrelated\nwith regard to system noise. It is assumed that the unmodeled frequency noise is also uncorrelated between\ntape-pairs.\n\nThe a priori observable noise was assigned on the basis\nof instrumental factors: system noise temperature and frequency standard noise.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL R E\n\nA\n\nu = Ap\n\n32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nThe fit residuals for this process are given by the difference\nbetween the observables and the fit function:\n\nBefore the final simultaneous fit to both delay and frequency observables, preliminary fits were made independently to each observable type. These preliminary fits\nwere used to establish the actual noise level in each\nobservable type and to check for consistency in the resulting baseline (equatorial component) solutions. In the first\nindependent fit to a given observable type, the weighting\nerrors were assigned the a priori values based on instrumental factors in Eqs. (20) arid (21). On the basis of this\nfirst fit using instrumental error estimates, fit residuals can\nbe calculated for the data type under investigation. The\nnoise exhibited by these residuals can be tested for conformity with the (I priori ermr estimates by means of chisquarc analysis. The fit chi-square is calculated according\nto the standard expression\n\n43\n\nwhere h denotes either the delay or the frequency data\ntype and q,is the a priori error in each Observable.

However, in those cases, the extra\nnoise on the residuals appeared to be uniformly distributed with no trends or singularly bad points.

The least-squares fit was then\nrerun for that data-type and the extra error term (N, N,)\nor\nwas adjusted to make chi-square equal to 1.0. Formally,\nthis procedure assumes that the total observable noise contains, in addition to the expected instrumental noise, an\nextra noise source that affects all tape-pairs equally without correlations between tape-pairs. The principal argument in favor of this error adjustment proceduie is that\nit is the simplest reasonable assumption that one can make\nwhen confronted with large, uniformly random residuals\ndue to an unmodeled noise source. Furthermore, since\nlarge uniform resiJvals indicate degradation of the solution, this procedure, in a gross sense, accounts for this\ndegradation in the fit and in the resulting covariance\nanalysis for parameter errors.\nAfter the observable noise was determined independently for each observable type by means of the chisquare analysis outlined above, the resulting observable\n44\n\n(29)\n\nwhere\n\nIf the preliminary chi-square, based on instrumental noise,\nfalls considerably above this range (> 3 ). then either the\nobservable model is inadequate or the observable noise is\nhigher than expected.\n\nu\n:\n,\n\nk = 1, N,,\n\n( , $ = (ArWA)g\na)\n\nI\n\nO V b , uZb,\n\nu 7 a ~u;,?

Results and Discussion\nThe Goldstone baseline has been measured in five separate experiments by means of radio interferometry. The\nfirst of these experiments, in January, 1971, involved only\nfringe frequency nieasurements. Since that experiment\nhas been described in a previous report (Ref. 2), only the\nresultipq baseline value will be included here. This section will outline the fitting results for the four subsequent\nbandwidth synthesis experiments. The fits to the delay\nobservable will be discussed first, followed by the fringe\nfrequency results.\nThe delays observed in the first bandwidth synthesis experiment are shown in Fig. 6. This set of observations covered about 14 h and involved 15 separate radio\nsources. Each data point represents the delay value obtaiped from one 12-min tape-pair. These delays were measured using two 24-kHz channels separated by 10 MHz\nat S-band with H-maser frequency standards at each station. Note the delay offset and the linear drift that has\nbeen i itroduced by the instrumentation. The scatter in\nthese delay values is due to an intentional 4-m bias in\nthe Q priori baseline that maps into a delay error which\nchanges as the antennas move from source to source. After\na least-squares fit for the baseline vector, delay offset, and\ndelay rate, the delay values in Fig. 6 produce the reduced\nresiduals in Fig. 7. Note that these residuals exhibit a\nfairly uniform scatter and an RMS spread of 4.7 ns.\nDelay values measured in the second experiment\n(8/16/72) are shown in Fig. 8. In this case, the two 24-kHz\nchannels were separated by 40 MHz, as discussed in Section 111. This set of observations covered about 8 h and\nJPL TECHNICAL R E W 32-1826, V\nW XIX\n\ninvolved 15 separate radio sources. Again, the scatter in\ndelay values is due to an intentional error in the u priori\nbaseline. After the least-squares fit, this wide scatter is\nreduced to the small delay residuals in Fig. 9 with an\nRMS spread of 0.5 11s. By contrasting these residuals with\nthe residuals of the IO-MHz system in Fig. 7, one readily\nsees the improved prr.ision of the larger synthesized\nbandwidth (note the scale change).\nFor the 4@MHz system, delay noise due to system noise\ntemperature was 0.1-1.0 ns foi correlated source strengths\nbetween 1 and 10 flux units. H-maser flicker noise ( ~ ff ,\n10-l\') should contribute negligible delay noise ( ~ 0 . 0 ns)\n8\nfor 8-h fit intervals. In the fit to the delay observables in\nthe first 40-MHz experiment (Fig 9), an additional noise\nterm N, equal to 0.25 ns had to be included to bring the\ndelay chi-square value down to its proper range (see Section V for a discussion of observable noise adjustment).\nBecause of this cstra no;se, the instrumentation configuration was checked for possible noise sources. In that configuration, ihe upper channel uas on the wing of the\nsystem bandpass, down 30 dB from the bandpass center.\nIn order to eliminate the possibility of differential phase\ninstability due to this situation, the system bandpass was\nbroadened by removing the S-band preselect3r in the\nDSIF receiver and by adjusting the maser magnetic field\nfor the last two experiments. When the delay data were\nanalyzed for these two reconfigured experiments, no extra\ndelay noise was required to place the delay chi-square in\nits proper range. Ti fitting result is readily ascertained\nhs\ngraphically by nc:ing that the delay residuals for the last\ntwo experiments, Figs. 10 and 11, are less noisy than the\nresiduals in Fig. 9. An upper limit on possible unmodeled\nnoise sources can be established by increasing the noise\nterm N , to the level that causes x\', to fall below 1.0 by 2a.\nFor the last two experiments, the value of N , required for\nsuch a x2 reduction is 6 cm. This result indicates that no\nunexpected (e.g., noninstrumental) noise sources greater\nthan 6 cm were present in the delay observable.\nThe fact that the delay residuals were at the system\nnoise limit places an upper bound on the differential ionosphere delays since the ionosphere effect should exhibit\na fairly random sign and magnitude. That is, as the antennas move from source to source, the interferometer\nray paths pierce areas of the ionosphere hundreds of\nkilometers apart. Since one would expect localized spatial\ninhomogeneities (Ikm) to be dissimilar over such a\n16\nwide range, the differential ionosphere delays are probably fairly random and appear as delay noise. Therefore,\nbecause the delay residuals place a limit on additional\nnoise, the differential ionosphere delays were evidently\nless than 6 cm.\n\nIn the fringe frequency fits, the residuals exhibited a\nrandom distribution with an m spread of 0.1-0.2 mHr.\nAn example of the frequency residtvals is shown in Fig. 12.\nIn all experiments the noise observed in the frequency\nresiduals was considerably above the expected instrumental noise. For example, the exzected instrumental\nfrequency noise due to system noise temperature is 2060 pHz for correlated source streigths between 3 and 10\nflux units. In addition, H-maser flicker noise can contribute an uncertainty of about 25 pHz. However, fer the\nlast bm experiments, the fitting procedure outlined in\nSection V required an additional noise term N, equal to\n0.1-0.2 MHz to bring the frequency chi square down to\nits proper range. The origin of tLs extra noise could easily\nbe the ionosphere. For esample, if thc diilerentia: ionospheric delay changed by 1 CIA in 700 s (one tape-pair),\nthe frequency effect would be 0.15 mHz Lt S-bad. Since\nthe ionosphere delay for a single ray path is 1 m, diqerential delay changn of this magnitude (1%)\nseem :2ssvnable.\nThe baseli.:: compcments p.,duced by all live expcriments are shown in Tablc 4 and in Figs. 13 and \'4. Xote\nthat as the frequency system stadiity mproved and as\nbandwidth synthesis was introduced, the forma1 precision\nin the equatorial components steadily improved from\n30 cm to about 3 5 cw. For the z-compn mt, the impmwment in measuremerrc precision is even mr.e dramatic.\nThe first experiment (January, 72) did not determim the\nz-component, since only fringe freqwncy was measureci.\nThe second experiment (April, 72). with a 10-MHz synthesized bandwidth, measured the z-component with a\nformal precision of 45 cm. The last two experiments,\nutilizing a 40-MHz synthesized bandwidth, determined\nthe z-component with a formal precisic.1 of about 3 cm.\nThe three baseline components are easily combined to\ngive the total length plotted in Fig. 14. Note that for all\nthree components and the total length, all interferometry\nbaseline measurements are in excellent agreement within\nthe formal precision. This agreement indicates that the\nformal covariance errors described in Section V are accurate estimates of actual precision for the present system.\nThe baseline vector between DSS 12 and DSS 14 has\nalso been determined by conventional survey techniques\n(Ref. 11) as indicatcd in Figs. 13 and 14 and in Table 4.\nNote that the length of the baseline vector obtained by\ngeodetic traverse is in excellent agreement with the interferometry result. However, the results for the three components do not agree. particularly the z-component where\nthe disagreement is about 60 cm (30).Both the interfero e r and survey techniques are being investigated to\nmty\ndetermine the source of this disagreement.\n\nVII. Summary and Conclusions\nA series of Goldstone baseline (16-km) measurements\nbave been wnducted to demonstrate the feasibility of\neventually using radio interferometry to monitor tectonic\nmotion. In the course of these experiments, frequencyand phars-stable instrumentation was developed to allow\ndelay measurements by means of two-channel bandwidth synthesis. The final system synthesized a 40-MHz\nhadwidth using a !&kHz bandwidth digital recording\nsystem and H-maser frequency standards. The delay\nmeasurements produced by this system lead to precise\nthree-dimensional baseline measurements. Because of\ninstmmental improvements, the formal baseline precision\nimproved from 30 cm to 4 em with about 8 hours of data.\nIn the last measurements, the delay residuals were found\nto lit at the system noise limit. ??lis fact indicates that\nthose delay observables were free of unmodeled noise\n\nabove the 6-cm leve!. In addition, the three m s pr2ot\ncise baseline measurements were in excellent agreemt-t\nwithin the expected statistics, which indicated a formal\nprecision of 25 cm for the various components. This\nagreement strongly indicates that formal baseline errors\nproduced by covariance analysis were good estimates of\nthe actual precision of the present system.\nSince instrumental precision is independent of baseline\nlength, these Goldstone measurements demonstrate the\nfeasibility of measuring baseline vectors of several thousand kilometers with ultimate accuracies of 1 4 cm. However, attainment of this accuracy for longer baselines will\nrequire additional calibrations for transmission media\neffects and whole-Earth motions such as universal time\n(UTl), polar motion, precession, and nutation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of C.J.

Potter\nCommunications Elements Research Section\n\nIn support of the Mariner VenuslMercuy 1973 (MVM73) X-band expedment\nand planned future Mariner missions, the 64-m antenna network is being supplied\nwith S-and X-band refrer feed systems. The initial instullath, for MWf73, u;as\nimplemented at DSS 14 and prmides satisfactory performance for I .t m s i n\niso.\nThe X-band performance of the dichroic rejlector is, however, not acc ytuble for\nplanned future missions which h u e more stringent X-banrl performance requirements. A new dichroic reflector which grossly reduces the X-band ellipticity and\nnoke temperature degradation has been designed. In this reporting, the thaoy and\ns\nexperimental performance of this new design i reported.\n\n1. Theory of Operation\nThe design and performance of the existing DSS 14\nreflex feed dichroic reflector (plate) was described in\nRef. 1 and is shown in Fig. 1. The plate is 3.576 cm thick,\nwith an array of hexagonally packed 2.273-cm-diameter\nholes drilled normal to the plate surfaces. The center-tocenter hole spacing is 2.388 cm, and the required frequency of operation is 8.415 GHz.\nAs described in Ref. 1, the E-and H-plane plate resonant frequencies (frequencies of complete transparency)\nare displaced because of a difference in the E- and\nJPL TECHNICAL RE#)RT 32-1526, VOL XIX\n\nH-plane free-space-to-circular waveguide transition discontinuity at the (tilted) plate surfaces. Since the plate is\nused with circular polarization, this resonant frequency\ndifference causes a diilerential phase shift between the\nE-and H-plane, resulting in depolarization of the circularly polarized incident wave. Additionally, because the\nplate is not reffectionless for all polarizations (at a fixed\nfrequency), a serious (approximately 2-K)\nnoise temperature contribution results from ground radiation. Actual\ncalculations using the Chen Holey Plate Computer Program (Ref. 2) show that the plate E-and H-plane resonant\nfrequencies (30deg incident wave tilt from normal) are\n8.481 and 8.363 GHz, respectively. At the operation he-\n\nquency of 8.415 GHz, a differentialphase shift of 11.3deg\nair e!Lp&it?- 3f 1.75 JE cxc p ~ & c : d . k t d amisured ellipticity was 1.84 dB. The reflected energy level\nis - 18 dB at 8.415 GHz.\nitid\n\nThe approach taken to cure the dichroic plate depolarization described above was to make the holes slightly\nnoncircular in cross section, thus introducing a daerential\nE- and H-plane phase shift within the plate to counteract\nthe 11.3-deg phase shift. This change is in the nature of\na perturbation on the original design, rather than a redesign; the original plate thickness and hole center spacing are retained. The particular hole cross sectior, selected\nis \xe2\x80\x9cPyleguide\xe2\x80\x9d (Ref. 3). This type of guide, circular with\na pair of flats on opposite sides, is used by JPL in the\n64-m antefina feed system polarizcrs. Pyle\xe2\x80\x99s (1964) analysis\n(Ref. 3) is approximate. It is now practical to numericdly\nsolve the wave equation in a cylindrical waveguide of\narbitrary cross section, yielding highly accul ate guide\nwavelength numbers as a function of geow4ry. An excellent computer program for this purpose * - - developed\nby b u d Pontoppidan, formerly of the Tec!micb University of Denmark (Ref. 4). The Pontoppidan program was\nmodified for use on the JPL Scientific Computing Facility\n(SCF) t\xe2\x80\x99nivac 1108 and set up for Pyleguide calculations.\nFigures 2a and 2b show the cutoff wavelength h , as a\nfunction oI\xe2\x80\x99 Pyleguide geometry for the E- and H-planes.\nThe design procedure for the Pyleguide dichroic plate\n\\vas to adjust the guide gometry (using the Pontoppidan\ncomputer program) until the plate electrical thickness at\n8.415 GHz for the E- and H-planes corresponded to those\nin the original circular hole plate at 8.481 and 8 3 3GHz,\n.6\nrespectively. The resulting geometry is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe hole diameter is 0.013 cm larger than the original\ncircular hole design, and the flat depth is 0 0 3 cm. Thus,\n.4\nthe redesign is only a small perturbation on the original\ndesign.\n\nII. Experimental Results\nThe X-band performance oi the Pyleguide dichroic\nplate sample was measured in the JPL Mesa Antenna\nRange anechoic chamber facility. Complete pattern data\nwere taken at the design (ai ! operational) frequency of\n8.415 GHz; frequency-scanned pattern data were taken in\nthe reflex feed symmetry plane. Optimum performance\nwas observed at the design frequency of 5.415 GHz. No\npattern distortion, grating lobe response, 3r other unexpected behavior was observed.\nFigure 5 shows the radiation pattern of the corrugated\nfeedhom by itself. Figure 6 illustrates the pattern of the\nfeedhornhilted dichroic plate combination in the plant.\ncontaining the horn axis and the plate normal (symmetry\nplane). For these patterns, the horn was circularly polarized and the illuminator was !inearly polarized but rapidly\nrotating about its axis. Thus, at each point in the radiation\npatterns, the ellipticity is displayed as a rapidly modulated signal level. As seen in Fig. 6, the ellipticity nulls\nout at a point 3 deg off axis and is 0.4 dB on axis. From\nsymmetry considerations, the antenna secondary pattern\naxial ellipticity will be nearly the same as the feed system\naxial ellipticity.\nIn Fig. 6, the large lobe in the region of 120 deg is the\nreflection from the horn side of the dichroic plate. This\nreflection gives rise to a mise temperature contribution\nfrom ground thermal radiation when the antenna is at low\nelevation angles. The power-average level for the Pykguide dichroic plate is -24.5 dB, yielding a maximum\nnoise temperature contribution of 0.7 K. The original\nround-hole plate has a power-average reflection lobe level\nof - 18.6 dB, yielding a noise contribution of 2.7 K. This\nlatter figure has been experimentally observed at DSS 14\n(see Fig. 8 of Ref. 1).\n\n111. Conclusion\nTo test the Pyleguide dichroic plate design, a sample\nsection of plate 35 X 53 cm in size was fabricated. The\nholes were made with a broach, allowing tight tolerances\n(+-0.005 cm) to be held on all hole dimensions. Although\nperformance of this type of dichroic plate is relatively\nnoncritical with regard to tolerences, the strict control\nwas imposed both as an experiment in fabrication technique (there were no problems) and also to provide a\ngood check betwer. predicted and measured performance. Figure 4 is a photograph of the sample Pyleguide\ndichroic plate. The following section describes the measured performance.\n56\n\nA different type of hole, \xe2\x80\x9cPyleguide,\xe2\x80\x9d has been incorporated into the reflex feed dichroic plate design to alleviate\npolarization degradation and noise temperature contribution due to plate mismatch (reflection). The plate ellip\nticity degradation has been reduced thereby from 1.8 to\n0.4 dB; the maximum noise temperature contribution has\nbeen reduced from 2.7 to 0.7 K.The ideal hole shape is a\nfunction of its location on the plate. The Pyleguide plate\ntested had all identical holes. Further performance improvement, if required, appears possijle by use of nonidentical holes. The ability to pedorm t i type of design\nhs\nentirely analytically has been demonstrated.\nJPL TECHNlCAL RE=\n\n32-1S26, VOL XIX\n\nReferences\n1. Potter, P.

This ne\' equipmeqt was added to\nDSS 14, Goldstone, California, a n i DSS 43, Canberra,\nAustralia, for the purposr of tracking Pioneer 10 during\nJupiter flyby. It was noted that ranging information could\n5, obtained when the transmitted frcquency was ramped\nby illrans of a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). The\nreturntad signal shows a pattern that is dependent upon\nthe round-trip light time, enabling measurements to be\nmade of the distance from the statior, to the spacecraft.\n\nSince the priiriary purpose of the installation of the\nDCOs was to support Pioneer 10 commanding duririg\nJupiter cncountcr, training exercises were scheduled to\npcricit station oprrators to become familiar with the new\nequipment and to establish working procedures for <he\nJupiter Syby. Data taken from DSS 14 were utiiized\nduring several of these training exercises, and processing\not the data was begun to see if range information could\nbe extracted.

G. Nishimura\nR. F. Systems Development Section\nAn operational DSN S-band receioer having two independent channels was\nmodified to provide capability for coherent reception at S- and X-bands simultaneously. Coherence at both bands was accomplished by usin2 a base-frequency\nmultiplier tchich was common to both the S- and X-band local oscilhtor multiplier chains.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn order to mrrt tht occultation experiment rcquirenirnts for cohcrent downlink phase information from a\nspacecraft at S- and S-bands, the DSN S-band open-loop\nreceiver at DSS 14 was modified. Presently, the openloop rrccivrr has two independent S-band channels.\nChairiiel2 was modified to receive at X-band. This modification was made without disturbing either S-band link.\nTo meet the requirements, Channel 2 was preceded by\nan S- to S-band down-converter. Switching networks\nwere addrd so that in the new S/X-band mode, occultation espcriments can be carried out simultaneously at\nS- and S-bands. Coherence requirements for the two\ndownlink signals were met by utilizing a common basefrequency for both the s-and X-band local oscillator (LO)\nchains. Whenever possible, components and modules\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nalready designed or in DSN use were employed in order\nto minimize replacement spares and cost.\n\nII. Physical Description\nThe S/X open-loop receiver c.:nsists hesicall) nf b:o\nassemblies mounted in the tricone at 9 S S 14. One xsc\'inbly, called the S/X open-loop rewiver panel (pan:,\\),\ncontains the time> -ixteen ( X 18) base-frequency multiplier and other iower-frec,:iency multii)liers to generate\nthe LO signal 101 the exis:iv:g S-band mixers jsec Fig. 1).\nThe panel, morinttr! in receiLr.1 cabinet 9, . 43 cm wide,\ns\n51 cm long, and c, -11. high.\nThe other assembly, S/X open-loop receiver box (box),\nconsists of a weather-resistant enclosure containing the\n71\n\ncomponents required in the generatior and conversion of\nthe higher S-band frequency (Fig. 2). The Box measures\napproximately 41 X 51 i( 15 cm deep.\n\n111. Development\nFigure 3 shows a block diagram of the S/S open-loop\nreceiver. Basically, the system consists of two reference\nfrequency sources which drive frequency multiplier\nchains to supply the LO signals for the existing S-band\nmixers and the new X-band mixer. The X16 basefrequency multiplier, which is common to both multiplier\nchains, has dual outputs. One output provides the drive\nfor the S-band LO chain, while the other provides the\ndrive for the X-band LO chain. Coaxial RF switches select\neither normal S-band operation or the new S/X-band\nmode. In the normal S-band mode, the existing S-band\nLO signals are switched into the existing S-band mixers.\nIn the S/X-band mode, the new coherent S-Land LO is\nswitched to the existing Chaiillel 1 S-band mixers, and\nsimultaneously, the X-band LO is switcIied to the new\nX-band mixer in Channel 2.\nStarting at the upper left in Fig. 3, reference frequency\nsource fl drives the dual output X 16 base multiplier. One\noutput of the X16 multiplier drives a X 3 multiplier,\nwhich generates the nominal 2245-MHz LO for the\nexisting S-band mixers. This LO signal is split by a 3-dB\nhybrid and followed by bandpass filters FL1 and FL2.\nSwitches S1 and S2 are operated simultaneously and, for\nS/X-band operation, select the new coherent LO generated by the X16 and X 3 multipliers. For normal S-band\noperation, S1 and S2 select the existing S-band LO signals.\nEither set of LOs is applied to the existing S-band mixers\nin Channels 1 and 2.\nThe other output from the X 16 base multiplier is used\nto further develop the LO for the new X-band mixer.\nA t the left in Fig. 3, reference frequency source f z drives\na X1/3 frequency multiplier. The output is mixed with\ntlic output from the X16 multiplier. The resultant sum\nfrequency, 2 nominal 765 MHz, is further multiplied by\na X 8 multiplier to provide the 6120-MHz LO drive for\nthe X-band mixer. The LO is procewd through bandpass filters and isolators HY2, FL3, HY3, FL4,and HY4\nbefore being applied to the X-band mixer. The X-band\ndownlink signal, nominally at 8415 MHz, comes in\nthrough the preselector filter and mixes with the 6120MHz X-band LO in X-band mixer M1. The resulting\ndifference intermediate frequency at 2495 MHz is amplified by AR1. Switch S3 operates tcgether with switches\n72\n\nS1 and S2, and when it is in the S/X-\\>and mode, selects\nthe 2295-MHz S-band IF gmerated by the X- to S-band\nmixer. When the switch is in the normal S-band mode,\nit selects the normal 9295-hIHz S-band signal to Channel\n2. The signal is then fed to the S-band mixer in Channel 2. The various signal frequencies are shown in the\ndiagram.\n\nPerhaps the most significant area of development\ndealt with the suppiession of spurious signals generated\nby the 6120-MHz X 8 frequency multiplier in the X - b a d\nLO chain.\nliitermodulatian products are generdted in the mixer\nfollowing the X 8 multiplier due to mixing of harmonics\nand sidebands of the X 8 multiplier output. Since the\nS- and X-bands are coherently related, the X 3 sideband\nat the output of the X 8 multiplier is at the same fret,uency as the I F from the X-band rnixer. In addition,\nthe X 5 and X11 sidebands mix with the X 8 output\nalso to generate an interference signal at the same frcquency. The intcrference signals coulrl mask the real\nsignals if they were not adeq..ately attenuated. Faced\nwith these possibilities, the best approach was to suppress every harmonic of the X 8 input frequency appearing at the multiplier output except the required LO for\nthe X-band mixer.\nBandpass filters FL3, FL-I and wideband isolators\nHY2, HY3, HY4 were used for this purpose. Typical\nmicrowave filters are of the reflective type, wherein high\nvoltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) is exhibited in the\nreject band. The addition of an isolator at the inpa t port\nallows ttc isolator to absorb the out-of-band reflected\nsignals by an order of about 20 dB per unit. The isolator\nalso helps in creatir:; a better match for the in-band\nfrequencies.\nBefore one can realize higher orders of suppression,\nRF leakage must be eliminated or at least minimized.\nTherefore, special precautions were taker in packaging\nthe X 8 multiplier, isolator HY2, and filter FL3 (Fig. 4).\nThe X 8 multiplier and HY2 were mounted within an\nRF-shielded enclosure. The input interface of F\'J was\nmounted flush against one exterior surface of the enclosure, with the input connector protruding into the enclosure through a clearance hole. The two mounting surfa-es\nwere machined smooth in order to minimize leakage. .\nWith this arrangement, the filter input was virtually RFisolated from its output. Skin currcnts a t the input were\nJPL TECHNICAL REWRT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\ncontained within thrb enclosure. Test results confirmed\nexcellent containment of leakag- in the area of the x8\nand FL3.\nBefore the filtering was added, the interference signal\nlevels were approximately -85 dBm following the X- to\nS-mixer. With the addition of HY2 and FL3, this level\nwas rduced to -141 dBm, a reduction of 56 dB. A\nsecond suppression stage, : :misting of HY3 and FL4\nwas added, and this reducec; the spurioas L ~ e l s\nwell\nbelow threshold signal levels. Because of reactive coupling between FL4 and the S-band mixer, HY4 was\nadded to insure a better VSWR.\nCertain precautionary measures had to I J observed\n~\nwhen working with these high attenuation levels:\nConiiectors had to be clean at their mating surfaces. Slight amounts of %reign matter tan easily\ninfluence test results. In this respect, the smaller\nconnectors, such as SMA, are notorious for generating metal flaking from their threads. Both connector ends should always be exznined for\ncleanliness before mating.\nSMA connections easily become loose during the\ncourse of testing and development. Best results\n\nIPL ESHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nwere obtained when thew connections wrre\ntorqued to aboilt 12.4 g.cm (9 in.-lb) brforc\nstarting tests.\n\nIV.

Sintv the maser gain fluctuates at this rate, it is\ndesirable t-. itch Tsat a rate greater than 8 Hz. It is also\nimportant . h o s e a rate that will not cohere with the\no\n1.2-Hz CCR rate.

Thus, the resolution is 0.1K for a\nsingle measurement of T , , from one Y-factor for the\nDSS 13 radiometer. This resolution is improved, by averaging a number of individual measurements. by the factor\n1 1 N. This results in a radiometer system with a mea\'\nsurement resolution on the order of a milli-Kelvin.\nFigure 1 shows a block diagram of the DSS 13 NAR\nsystem. In the figure, SD is the solid-state noise diode in\nan oven. The detector is the unit described in Refs. 1\nand 2. Any detector departure from true square law has\ntwo effects: (1) measurement inaccuracy and (2) susceptibility to gain fluctuation. Thus. all measurements are corrected by a factor Q, as described in Ref. 2, so that the\nmeasurement Y-factor is given by\n\nwhere V, and V,are the detector output voltages with the\nnoise diode off and on, respectively. The I F bandwidth\nat the input to the detector is 5 MHz. The frequency output from the detector is fed to the compv.ting counter.\nThe computing counter is Model H.P. 5360A, and the\ncomputing counter programmer is Model H.P.6376A.\nThese two units comprise a small computing system with\ninput .\'output capability, which is capable of executing\n200 program steps with an average execution time of 15 ps\nper step. It is also capable of accepting input data in BCD\nform, reading an externally generated frequency, and perfonning various external functions by means of "I,-type\nsignal levels. In addition, sixdigit constants are available\nin thumbnheel form for use in the program. The programmer commands the noise source driver which turns\nthe noise diode on and off.\nThe programmed controller, Model 601, commands\nthe computing counter and interfaces with the station\n90\n\nXDS 910 camputer, as shown in the figure. The programmed controller commands the 910 with azimuth and\nelevation offset functions, and the 910 drives the antenna\nservo in the usual way. The programmed controller is\ndescribed in detail in Ref. 4.\n\n111. Method of Operating the NAR System\nThe detector correction factor a is first measured and\nthen set on the thumbwheels as a system coastant for the\nduration of the NAR observing period. To determine the\ncorrect value for the correction factor, the a-thumbwheels\nare first set to zero, the waveguide switch is switched to\nthe ambient load, the NAR is run, and the detected output level is set to 1.8 V, with the noise diode on. The\nambient load is connected to the maser input to ensure\na constant system temperature during the measurement\nof a. There is the possibility of radio sources passing into\nor out of the antenna beam if the maser were connected\nto the horn at this time. The I F input level to the detector\nis then reduced by 10 dB, and a new system temperature\nis computed. If the system temperature at the lower gain\nsetting is lower than the system temperature at the higher\ngain, a greater value for a is required. The correct value\nfor Q is found experimentally by determining that value\nr.f Q which produces the same value of To, for both gain\ns-Kings.\nThe second system constant that must be determined is\nthe correct value for Ts. When this is found, it is entered\nin the second set of thumbwheels and held constant for\nthe duration of the experiment. With the ambient termination on the maser input, the system temperature is\ngiven by\nTop= T p T + T p\nM\n\n+\n\nwhere\n\nT p= physical temperature of the ambient termination\nmeasured with a quartz thermometer probe.\n\nTy= equivalent input noise terrperature of the maser.\nT, = equivalent input noise temperature of the folIowup receiver.\nIf the maser is turned on and off, a Y-factor ratio Y,,,,\nis\nmeasured. This ratii, is given by\n\nWith e knowledge of Tu and T p and a measurement of\nYo,, .,* can be calculated. The system temperature with\nthe ambient termination on the maser input is then known.\nJPL TECHNICAL RE=\n\n32-1126,WL XIX\n\nThe T , thumbwheel is adjusted until the NAR computes\nthe correct system temperature. The maser input is then\nswitched to the antenna. and the NAR computes the system temperature on the antenna.\nThe third thumbwheel constant to be determined is N,\nthe number of measurements which are averaged to yield\nthe output system temperature T o p Since measurement\ncertainty is given by\n\nwhere AT is the measurement resolution as stated above,\na value for N may be chosen that \\vi11 produce the desired\nradiometer resolution. If the antenna is moving in eleva-\n\ntion during the measurement, N should be kept sufficiently small so that the real change in antenna temperature does not exceed the desired A T N S .\nThe noise diode is enclosed in a constant-temperature\n(50\xc2\xb0C) oven.

Clauss and E. Wiebe\nCommunicationsElements Research Section\n\nTwo S-band w e r systenrp with equioabnt input noise temperatures of i 2 K\nhave been supplied to the Deep Space Network. These masers will be med on d - m\nantennas at Deep Space Stations 14 and 4 to meet special requirements of the\n3\nManner Venus/Mercuy (MVM73) mission. The masers use a new shortened and\ncooled Signal input transmission line to reduce noise and are equipped with superconducting magnets to ptooide the best possible stability performance.\n\n1. Introduction\nSpecial requirements far the Mariner Venus/ Mercury\nmission showed a need for S-band masers with improved\nsensitivity and stability characteristics. Two new systems\nfor DSSs 14 and 43 have been built in response to these\nrequirements. The maser systems have new shortened and\ncooled input transmission lines which reduce the noise\ntemperature as compared to previous systems. Superconducting magnets are used to improve maser gain, phase,\nand group delay stability. Optimum maser performance\nis achieved at 2295 MHz; the maser equivalent input\nnoise temperature is 2.1 K at 22% MHz. An overall system temperature of 8.3K was measured during the cvduation of these new systems.\n\nII. Input Transmission Line\nA new signal input transmission line has resulted in a\nsubstantial reduction of maser equivalent input noise ternJPL lECHNlCAL RE#NIT 324526, WH. XIX\n\nperature. Previously reported systems (Refs. 1and 2) were\nmeasured to have maser input noise temperatures of\nbetween 4 and 8 K at the S-band waveguide interface\n(2.1 K was contributed by the signal input transmission\nb e ) . The new signal input transmission line described\nbebw contributes 0.4 K to the mascr noise temperature.\nThe improvement is achieved by coo!ing the center conductor of the coaxial line to 4.5 K, by shortening the line\nlength to I8 cm, and by using a very-low-lossvacuum seal.\n\nThe new transmission line, asscmbld with an S-band\nmaser and closed-cycle helium refrigerator (CCR), is\nshown in Fig. 1. The superconducting magnet, radiation\nshields, and the vacwum jacket cover have been remov,:.\nFigure 2 is a sketch identifying important features of the\nassembly.\nA fused quartz dome provides part of the vacuum seal.\nThe quartz dome is attached and sealed to the WR 430\ninput waveguide with flexible epoxy. An O-ring vacuum\n93\n\nseal is used between the waveguide and the adapter plate.\nThe waveguide and fused quartz dome assembly can be\nreplaced without disturbing other input line m,nponents;\nit is a field-replaceable assembly.\nThe coaxial transmission line outer conductor is made\nof thinwall (0.25-mm) stainless steel tubing; the inside is\nplated with rdO25-mm capper and 0.0003-mm gold. This\ncombination $ves low microwave loss and adequate thermal isolation. Mechanical support for the transmission\nline is obtained by clamping a flange at the room temperature end of the outer conductor, between the adapter\nplate and the WR 430 waveguide. Thermal connections\nto the 80-K and 4.5-K CCR stations are made with flexible\ncapper straps.\nThe transmission line center conductor contacts the\nouter conductor at the 4.5-K SMA connector and at the\nsupport clamp (which is thermally connected to the 4 . 5 4\nCCR station). A vacuum, common to the CCR vacuum\njacket, provides thermal insulation between the coaxial\nline center conductor and its surrounding parts (outer conductor and quartz dome). The center conductor is made\nof gold-plated, polished copper. Refrigeration capacity\nmeasurements show that the total heat transferred to the\n4.5-KCCR station (by radiation to the center conductor and by conduction through the outer conductor) is\napproximately 100 mW. The voltage standing wave ratio\n(VSWR)of the transmission line and waveguide assembly\nis less than 1.15 to 1 from 2050 to 2650 MHz. Q measurements, insertion loss, and temperature gradient calculations were used to determine the 0.4-K noise contribution\nof this transmission line assembly.\n\nThe new transmission line assembly is adaptable to all\nS-band maser systems presently used in the DSN. The conversion requires installation of a superconducting magnet.\n\n111. Superconducting Magnet\nThe use of a superconducting magnet, rather than a\nlarge, external permanent magnet, has several advantages: (1) it improves maser gain, signal phase, and group\ndelay stability (Ref. 3); (2) the overall package weight can\nreduction\nbe reduced from 2oo to m kg; and (3) the\npermits connection of the signa1 input waveguide in close\nproximity to the 4.5-K CCR station. A Block I11 maser\nsystem (Ref. 1) has been retrofit with a superconducting\nmagnet and is currently used for two-way tracking on the\n04-m antenna at DSS 14. (This maser system does not\nhave the new input transmission line.)\n94\n\nIV. Maser for SMT Cone\nThe maser currently in use in the S-band mega..vatt\ntransmit (SMT) conC at DSS 14 uses the new input transmission line and achieves a noise temperature of 2.1 K at\n2295 MHz. The maser comb structure is of the Block I11\ntype, with modified ruby shape (loadingj to achieve a\nwide tuning range. The maser can provide more than\n4 dB net gain at any frequency between 2 and\n0\nm\n2400 MHz. A maximum gainlbandwidth product is obtained when the maser is centered at 2285 MHz. Excess\ngain can be traded for bandwidth by use of field staggering co9s within the supcrconducting magnet. A frequency\nresponse flat within 1 dB from 2270 to 2300 MHz is available at 42 dB net gain.\n\nV. Maser for DSS 43\nA second maser with a noise temperature of 2.1 K has\nbeen built for use at DSS 43. A previouslv built maser\ncomb structure (Ref. 2) was used to save on system construction time and cost. The maser is not capable of the\nlarge gain bandwidth product achieved by the maser for\nthe SMT cone. The maser provides an S-MHz, 1-dB bandwidth at 44 dB net gain at 2295 MHz center frequency.\nThe pump klystron used with the DSS 43 system is identical to those presently used with Block I11 maser systems and does not provide 2388-MHz operation. The low\nforward loss of this particular maser is equal to that of\nthe SMT cone unit, and identical noise performance at\n2295 MHz is a c h i e v d\n\nVI. Noise Temperature Measurements\nComparative system temperature measurements of\nmasers described here have been made. A photograph of\nthe maser/CCR package for the SMT cone, with horn\nand ambient temperature microwave-absorbing material,\nis shown in Fig. 3. Precision power measurements with\nand without the absorber material over the horn resrilted\nin a total operating system noise temperature of 8.4 K.\nBest estimates of noise contributions for the parts of the\nsystem are given in Table 1. Measurements of the maser\nsystem previously used with :he SMT cone showed a total\noperating system temperature of 10.7 K. Laboratory measurements using a liquid-helium-cooled waveguide termk,ation indicated a 4.4-K maser noise temperature for\nthe o?der SMT maser (Ref. 2).\nMeasurements of the maser for DSS 43 gave the lowest\noverall noise temperature values. The system was measured in the same configuration as that planned for inJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1126, O XIX\nVL\n\nstallation on the 64-m antenna at DSS 43. A calibrating\ncoupler and polarizer were included in the waveguide\nsystem. The slight loss of these components was offset by\n\nthe use of a better horn than was used in the carlier\ntests. A total operating system temperature of 8.3 K was\nmeasured.\n\nReferences\n1 Trowbridge, D.

A summary of the zenith qstem\nmise temperature meawremnts for calendar year 1973 for the diplexed S-band\nsystem at DSS 14 is described and plotted.\n\nIn a previous article (Ref. l),system temperature measurements were made at DL:S 14 of the S-band Megawatt\nTransmit (SMT) cone S-bar) I system and the multifrequency X-and K-band (MXK) Lane X-band system. Thebe\nmeasurements were elevatior profiles with the reflex feed\nsystem both extended and retracted. Since these measurements were nade, certain improvements (Ref. 2) have\nbeen made to the maser in the SMT cone, the effect of\nwhich has been to reduce the SMT system operating noise\ntemperature. Other impro-iements since previous reports\n100\n\n(Ref. 3) have included the taping of the 64-mantenna surface. T i article reports recent precision system temperahs\nture measurements made with the X-and the improved\nS-band systems, as they will be used for the MVM73\nmission. The present measurements were made with the\nNoise-Adding Radiometer (Ref. 4) and the ambient lw,d\nterminGtions. Verification tests of the ambient load were\nmade with a microwave absorber over &e horn, and voltage standing wave ratios of the ambient load and horn\nwere checked.\nJ M TECHNICAL REPMn 32-1526. w)L XIX\n\nFigure 1 shows elevation profiles for the S- and X-band\nsystems. The S-band data were obtained with maser serial\nnumber 80S2 in the SMT cone and the X-band data\nwith maser serial 150x2 in the MXK cone. The dichroic\nfeed system was extended, the atmosphere was clear, and\nthe antenna azimuth was fixed at 180 deg. The masers\nwere tuned to 2295 and 8415 MHz, respectively, and the\niollow-up receiver contribution was measured as less than\n0.1 K in each case.\nTable 1is a sun.mary of the system operating noise temperature performance of the SMT and MXK cones.

Parham\nCommunications Elements Research Section\n\nA programmed controller has been designed for opemtion with a Noise Adding\nRadiometer (NAR) for the cartomatic control of certain tracking station functions\nThese fundons include the operation of the NAR, the operation of ux.*-eguide\nswitche, and the control of the pointing of the 26-m antenna. This article desrribes\nthe &sign and operation of the progrcnmed controller.\n\nThe Model 601programmed controller was designed for\nthe automatic control of certain tracking station functions,\nincluhg the operation o the NAR (Ref. l),the operation\nf\nof waveguide switches, and the control of the pointing o\nf\nthe 26-m antenna. The controller provides sixteen timed\ncontact closures. The contact closures and timing are p m\ngrammed by eight-level USASCII punched paper tape.\nThe controller consists of four functional sections: tape\nreader, timer, relay register, and control (Fig. 1).\n\nThe tape reader is a low-cost photoelectric unit with\nstepper motor drive that reads the program tape at\nloo cps.\nThe timer section is a three-digit, double b&ered, preby the time\nfield of the instruction.When c.\xe2\x80\x99-?set the programmed\nto\ntime and started, it decremm3 &t rate of 10 Hz until it\na\nequals zero. The maximum programmable time intend\nis 99.9 s and the idnimum i 0 s.\ns\n\nThe relay register is also double buffered, and provides\nthe outputs in the form of isolated contact closures. It is\nprogrammed by the pattern field of the instruction in the\nform of A 1 for a closed contact and A 0 for an open\ncontact.\nThe control section instructs the tape reader when to\nr e d , and controls the flow of data to the timer and relay\nregister kput b h r s . It recognizes E,P,S, and T as control characters, and the digits 0-9 as data characters. All\nother characters are ignored and not loaded. Additionally,\nall characters including control and data within parentheses are ignored. This allows the program tape, without\ndecting its operation, to contain a title, statement numbers, or any other comments that may assist an operator\nwheu the tape is r..inched or listed on a teletype.\n\nscttalu:e down counter [ha? IS programmed\n\nThe :i character is a multi-purpose control character. If\nthe front panel halt switch is in the enable position, the\ntape reader will stop when an S is read. When the front\npanel reset switch is closed, the tape advances, ignoring\n\nall instructions, and halts on the next S character. At this\npoint, the program may be started by closing the front\npanel start switch. Additionally, an alarm, that can be\nenabled by front panel control, is provided to signal an\noperator that the tape is stop,,d on a halt. With one S\ncharacter located at the beginning of a program tape,\nthese functions allow an operator to load a program tape\nat any position in the program, initialize the program\ntape to the beginning, and execute the program continuously, or once and halt.\nThe contents of the timer snd the relay register are\ndisplayed on the front panel for operation verification. An\nadditional front panel control, the mode switch, is provided to allow program checking. Each time it is closed\nin the step position, an instruction is read and displayed.\nIn normal operation, with the mode switch in the run\nposition, as an instruction is read, the characters following a P character are loaded one at a time into the right\nend of the relay register input buffer. As each new character is read in, the previously loaded characters are\nhs\nshifted left one place. Ti process continues until a T or\nE character is read. The characters following a T are\nloaded into the timer input buffer in the same fashion as\nthe relay register was loaded. Again this action continues\nuntil a P or E character is read.\nWhen an E is read, this indicates the end of the ~ r > s t r u c tion. First, the contents of the timer input buffer are\nloaded into the timer and, at the same time, the relays\n\nare set; then, a few microseconds later, the timer is started\nand both input buffers are cleared.\nThe tape reader continues, reading the next instruction\nuntil another T is read. At this point, the timer is tested.\nIf the timer has reached zero, the rest of the instruction is\nread and executed, and the following instruction is read.\nIf the timer has not reached zero when the T character is\nmad, the tape reader stops and waits. When the timer\nreaches zero, the tape reader restarts and finishes reading\nthe instruction.\nThe program tape is normally in the form of an endless\nloop. The instruction format is flexible in that the time\nand pattern fields may be interchanged, and the data in\neach field are right-justified as they are read. The omission of unnecessary zeros allows the instructions to be\ncompact. Table 1 shows some examples of various program instructions.\nFigures 2 and 3 are phr\xe2\x80\x99 -qaphs of the standard rackmounted Model 601 programmed controller.\nA Model E?: egramnred conti-oller is currently being\nused at DSS lb .o control the operation of an NAR, the\noperation of waveguide switches, and the pointing of the\ncomputer-driven %m antenna. Programs for the codguration include bore-sighting, on-source/off-source tracking, radio source drift curve generation, and radiometer\nhs\ncalibration. T i has been described in an accompanying\narticle (Ref.2).\n\nReferences\n1. Batelaan, P., Goldstein, R.

J. Freiley\nCommunications Elements Research Section\n\nDuring F e b w y and March 1973,the DSS 14 64-m antenna was fitted with\nmaim structural braces, and other structural modifications were made to improue\nlow angle elevation system gain performance at centimeter wavebngths. The neu;\nsystem performance, as defined by the radiometric measurements of M a y 1973, is\ncompared to the previous performance, with rcspect to system &iercy, subreflector focus, and equivalent radio frequent!! ( R F ) surface tolerance. The\nevaluation shows that the predicted efect of ihe structural braces has been\nachieoed; however, either the main reflector M subreflector surface tolerance, OT\nboth, have been degraded. The degradation is well defined at X- and Ku-band\nfrequencies; at S-band the effect is near& negligible.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe radio frequency (RF)performance of the DSS 14\n64-m antenna was measured to evaluate the effectiveness\nof the antenna modifications undertaken during FebruaryMarch 1973. These modifications consisted of the installation of major structural braces and other modifications\nto the structure fnr noise abatement (Refs. 1, 2). To\nobtain the total antenna performance, radiometer measurements of selected radio sources were undertaken at\nX- and Ku-bands prior to and after the modifications.\nThese radio sources were selected to eliminate the uncertainty associated with less accurately known sources\nand to maintain consistency with previous measurements.\nThe results show a pronounced change in the antenna RF\n110\n\nperformance, most likely attributable to a change in\nantenna surface tolerance.\n\n!I. Antenna Modifications\nThree major activities occurred during FebruaryMarch 1973: The first was the installation of the structural\nbraces (Refs. 1, 2) to improve the RF surface tolerance at\nelevation angles between 6 and 45 deg. Another activity\nwas the resetting of the main reflector panels after the\ninstallation of the structural braces. The third activity was\nthe welding of the panels of the subreflector to reduce the\nnoise associated with diplexed high-power microwave\ntransmission.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1126, VOL. XIX\n\n111. Radio Sources\nThc perfarniancc chaiactcristics were measured using\ntwo systems: (1)the S-band qsteni at 8.415 GHz (3.56\ncni)\nand (2) the Ku-band systcni at 15.3 GHz (1.96 cm). The\nradionit1tc.r n ~ ~ a ~ ~ r ~ ~were nmade of SCI 23 m d\nrne ts\nSaturn at S-band and Ku-band, respectively. Noise\nadding racliomrtcrs w e r c used at each frcquency. Table 1\ndescribes the soiirce charactclristics used.\n\nIV. Radiometer Technique\nThe radiometer technique med consists of three parts:\nThe first is the boresighting of the antenna about the\nhalf-power points of the beam. Care was taken tu L w r e\nboth speed and accuracy of the boresights. At these\nfrequenrcies, the axial focus of the system is importapt.\nTherefore, before each set of data was taken, the avtenna\nwas focused in the axial direction. To accomplish this,\nthe analog output of the total power noise adding radiometer (NAR) was displayed on a chart recorder. Whilz\nthe antenna beam was on source, the subreflector was\nslewed from the out position to the in position and back\nagain to determine the optimum indicated position. The\nthird portion of the radiometer technique consists of the\non-off source operating system temperature measurements. From two off source and one on source measurements, the off murce operating system temperature and\nthe source temperature can be determined for a particular\ndevation angle. By knowing the flux density of the\nobserved source, one can calculate the antenna efficiency.\n\ncome greater as the antenna is mowd in elevation. Thcrefore, the axial focus of the antrnnn has become more\ncritical for all users.\nThe off source operating system temperature for clear\nweather was not affected by the antenna modifications\n(Fig. 3). The Ku-band operating system temperature is\n25 K at zenith, and the X-band operating system tcmpe Ature is 33 K at zenith, which includes 1.5 K at zenith\ncontributed by the dichroic feed, used during bqth data\nperiods at band (Ref. 3).\n\n>.\n\nThe intent of the structural braces was to improve the\nRF surfac- *olerance at elevation angles between 6 and\n45 deg, v ch would also improve the RF system efficiency between those angles. The system efficiencies as\nderived from Table 1and the radio metric measurements\nare presented in Figs. 4 and S . The system efficiencies in\nthe figures are as would be ohserved in spacecraft and\nradio science missions; the efficiencies have not been\ncorrected for the atmospheric loss effects (I,,,,)nor the waveguide loss effects (L,) but have been corrected for the\neffect of solwe size. The results following the structure\nmodifications are lower than espected. The modifications\nhave, in fact, generally decreased the system efficiency, as\nsummarized in Table 2. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the\nmodifications have decreased the peak system efficiencies but have improved the change in system cfficiency\nas a function of elevation angle, as was predicted (Ref. 1).\nThe net result is that the peak system efficiency is lower\nbut the system efficiency at 10 deg elevation is about the\nsame as before.\n\nV. Radiometer Data\nThe basr performance of the antenna system is defined\nby measurements made in January 1972 at Ku-band and\nin January 1973 at X-band. The antenna system performance as detcrniined by the May 1973 measurements is\ndirectly comparable. The same sources were observed\nwith the same systems.\nThe antenna axial focus is an elevation angle dependent\nfunction. The fitted curves representing the optimum position for the January X- and Ku-band systems agree very\nwell (Figs. 1, 2 ) . The agreement is within approximately\n2.5 mm indicated control room position. The fitted\ncurves reprcsriiting the optimum position for the May Xand Ku-band systems also agree very well-within\napproximately 5 mm indicated control mom positions.\nSignificant diffcrcnces occur between the January and\nthe May data. The February-March 1973 modifications\nhave caused thc. focal length changc of the system to beJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nThe desirable effect of decreasing the change of system\nefficiency from the peak was offset by a decrease in the\npeak sjvstem efficiency. To determine a possible cause for\nthe effects seen, one should examine the RF surface\ntolerance. By assuming a flat-Earth atmospheric loss approximation and using the information given in Table 3\nfor the calculated system efficiency for 100% efficient\nreflecting surfaces, and by measuring the actual system\nefficiency, it is possible to determine the loss due to the\nsurface telerance. This loss has been converted to an\nequivalent RMS surface tolerance by the method of Ruze\n(Ref. 4) and is represented for all cases in Figs. 6 and 7.\nThe R M S surface tolerance of the antenna before the\nFcbruary-March modifications was 1.15 mm at 45 deg\nelevation, which increascd to approximately 1.65 mm at\n15 deg clevation. After the modifications, the RMS surface tolerance is approximately 1.46 mm, which increases\nto 1.62 mm at 15 deg elevation.\n111\n\nVI. Conclusions\nThe modifications to the DSS 16 64-m antenna accomplished during February-March 1973have been evaluated\nat X- and Ku-bands using radiometer techniques. The\npeak system efficiency at 45 deg elevation angle has\ndecreased at both bands, but the change in system\nefficiency with elevation angle has been improved.\nThe conclusions reached are that (1) the structural\nbraces have decreased the effect of the RMS surface tolerance change with elevation angle, and (2) the combination\nof the main reflector rex: and the welding of the subreflector has increased the overall RMS surface tolerance.\nAnother way of stating this is to say that the dynamic\n\ndistortions (elevation angle dependent gravity induced\ndeformations to the main reflector backup structure) have\nbeen improved; the static distortion component (elevation\nangle independent settir.g precisioii of either one or both\nreflector panels) has been degraded. The reason for the\nincreased axial focus sensitivity as a function of elevation\nangle is not understood.\nThe peak system efficiency at 45 deg elevation angle\nhas been reduced 0.5 dB at X-band and 1.6 d S at Ku-band.\nUsing the surface tolerance values obtained from these\nshort-wavelength observations, a predicted change of\n0.04 dB at S-band at 45 deg elevation angle is obtained.\nThis loss is reduced at lower elevation angles.\n\nRefw-ences\n1, Katow, M.

R. Rodemich\nCommunications Systems Research Section\n\nA problem related to the optimal placement of three tracking stations for purposes of tuv-station tracking is fonnutated and solved.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is k n o w (and easy to see) that three tracking antennas, however they are placed on the globe, cannot\nprovide total coverage of the celestial sphere. However.\nsince most interesting deep-space ienomena (spacecraft\nand natural astronomical objects) have small declinatior,s,\nthis fact is of little practical importance. For example, the\nDSNs 64-m antennas cannot \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d urtain points on the\ncelestial sphere at declinations of 28 deg or so.\nOf course there is typically much overlap in the coverage of the celestial sphere provided by three stations, m\nn\nd\nthis overlap can be used to good advantag since simul-\n\ntaneous two-station tmcking is possible in these Joublycovered regions. Two-station tracking is useful for a\nvariety of reasons. For example, since the diurnal doppler\namplitude is proportional to the cosine ~f the declination,\naccurate determination of space\\: ,aft declination using\ndoppler is quite dificalt at declinations near zero. Two116\n\nstation tracKing ran however be used for accurate goniometry at all declinations. Also, accurate tracking of\ncoirstaritly accelerating spacecraft could best be done with\ntwo stations. Finallv, important astronomical knowledge\ncan be gained from interferometric data.\nThus it is desirabie to have as much of the celestial\nsphere as possible doubly covered. It is easy to see, how.\nevei, that if no point on the celestial sphere is visible from\nall three stations simultaneously, the total area that is\ndoubly covered is always the same. We therefore arrive\nat the question answered in this article: K%at is the maximum overlap possible b&ween the cover.-ges of the celestial sphere provided by two of the antcnnas, given that 311\nthree cover all celestial declinations that are less than a\nR x d imount?\nMore precisely, let us assume that the three antennas\neach cover a circular cap of angular radius p on ?he celestial spherc, and that it is required that h a three C: ,cular\nJPL TECHWlCAC R\nE 32-1526. VOL. XIX\nm\n\ncaps cover all objects with declinations in the range\n[ -a, a ] . Then we \\-ish to maximize the region of intersection of two of the caps.Surprisingly, the optimal configuration does wt aiways have all three stations centered on\nthe equator.\nIn the case of the 64-m net, B = 8 4 O and a is about Bo.\nIt will turn out that there is a configuration of three\na = &Lo circular ( 2 cowring the band of declinations\ns\nbetween +?8O with two of the stations separated by only\nnoon the globe. (This configuration has RUthree stations\non the equator.) However, the closest pair of stations on\nthe 64-m net (Goldstone and Madrid) are separated by\n8 2 O . Thus as far as two-station tracking is concerned,the\n64-mnet is far from optimally arranged.\n\nII. Solution to the Problem\nThree spherical caps of ang-ikr radius p (0 < 19 < 7 \'2)\nare to cover the band on the sphere with latitudts\nbetween - a and P (0 4 ?I < :/2). We want to maximize\nthe area of the region of inter rtion of two of thc caps.\nDenote latitude on the sphere by 8, and let + measure\nlongitude west from some reference point. L t the cap C\ne\nj\nhave center at (8,,+j). Since each cap covers less than\nhalf \'he equator, following the equator around we see\nthe caps in a cyclic order C,, C?, and C, such that\n0 < 41 - +j-, (mod2r) < P. It c a be~shown that the\n~\ncaps a v e r the whole band in the same order that they\ncover the equator: if C, intersects the band in the region\nS i , then the band is the union of six disjoint regions\n\ns, - S, - s , S, n sz, s, - S, - s,, S, n s, S, - S, - s,\n,\n,\n.\n\na covering if 4.

This is\nequivalent to maximizing the cosine of the angle between\nthe centers cf C , and C,, which is\ncos BIZ = cos 6,cos 8?cos (4, - +)\n\n+ sin 8, sin 6,\n\n(2)\n\nThere i an extrema1 covering for this problem, if and /3\ns\nare such that some coverings exist. Hence it is suf6cient\nto consider only those coverings for which there is no obvious variation that increases cos O12.\nIf we move each cap C,to a position centered on the\nequator at (O,+j), we preserve the covering or the band.\nFor, if we denote the points A;, etc., in the new &tion\nare diametxically opposite on the cap,\nby bars, and\nhence\n\nBy symmetry, this is equivalent to\n\nSimilarly\n\nand S, n SI,\neach of which extends across the band.\n\nC, contains the points (8,+) that sahsfy the hequality\nC O S ~ ~ C X X ~ C O S ( +- +j)\n\n+sin$jsh8~.~0~/3\n\nThe boundary of Cj intersects the boundaries of the band\nin b r points A;,Aj.

K. Levitt\nCommunications Systems Research Section\n\nThis paper describes a practical frame synchronization (sync) acquisition and\nmaintenance algorithm based on the Hamming distance met-:.; which is a gmeralidion of the scheme developed for the 1973 Mariner mission to Venus and\nMerccry (MVM73). For the special case of uncoded phase-shift-keyed duta reymti\nceived mer the binary s m e r c channel, formulas are derived for computing an\nupper bound on the probability af false sync acquisition, the mean time to sync\nacquisition, and the mean time to the subsequent loss of sync, as a function of the\nbit error rate, frame length, sync word length, and algorithm parameters. These\nformulas are directly applicable to the uncoded MVM\xe2\x80\x9973 telemety modes, and a\nnumerical example relating to the 117.6 kilobits/s real time TV mode is inc!uded.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe problem of establishing frame synchronization\n(sync) usually involves the identification of received sync\nwords periodically interspersed with random data (Ref. 1).\nFor uncoded binary signals received over the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise channel, the frame sync words are\noften located by finding segments of the raxived data\nthat are highly correlated with the transmitted sync word\n(Ref. 2). Massey (Ref.3) has in fact shown that the optimum sync word seerch requires the addition of a correction term to this correlation rule. If hard decisions are\nmade 011 the received data prior to the acquisition of\nframe synchronuation, the problem is reduced to detecting the sync words in uncoded data received over the\n126\n\nbinary symmetric channel: in this case, the optimum\nframe sync decision is based on the Hamming distance\nmetric.\n\nThis article examines the performance of a practical\nframe sync acquisition and maintenance algorithm for\nuncoded phase-shift-keyed (PSK)data received over the\nbinary symmetric channel. Because the detected PSK data\nnecessarily have a binary phase ambiguity that cannot be\nresolved until frame sync is established, the algorithm\nbases its sync decision on a modified Hamming distance\nrule. Instead of making a hard sync decision over a single\nframe of received data, the algorithm scans the detected\nbit stream, searching for a sequence whose Hamming distance from the sync word satisfies a threshold test. When\nJPL TECHNICAL RE#)RT 32-1=,\n\nWL XIX\n\nthe bit error rate is high and the threshold is stringent, the\nreliability of the sync decision is improved dt the expense\nof delaying that decision for several frames. For additional reliability, a hard sync decision is made only when\ntwo received sequences one frame apart both satisfy the\nthreshold test.\nThe frame sync algorithm described herein is not exceptionally innovative, and variations on the same approach\nhave been used on past Mariner missions. It is in fact a\ntwo-threshold generalization of the particular acquisition\nand maintenance algorithm that was developed for use\nwith the uncoded and biorthogonally coded telemetry\nmodes of the Mariner 10 spacecraft (MVM73\xe2\x80\x98. The principal purpose of this brticle is to document the performance analysis of this algorithm for uncoded PSK data\nreceived over the binary symmetric channel. Markov\nmodels arc employed in this analysis to dcrive formulas\nfor computing an upper bound on the probability of false\nsync acquisition, as well as the mean time to sync acquisition, and the mean time to thc subsequent loss of sync,\nfor arbitrary bit error rates, frame lengths, sync word\nlengths, and thresho!d values. These formulas are directly\napplicablc to the uncoded MVM\xe2\x80\x9973 telemetry modes, and,\nas a numerical example below, they are x e d to determine\noptimum threshold values as a function of the channel bit\nerror rate for the high-rate (117.6kilobits/s) real time TV\ndata modc. It should be noted here that the author has\nextended the algorithm performance analysis to include\nthC MVM\xe2\x80\x9973\ncmP1oYing a\nthogonH1\ncode, although the work has not been published\nto date.

Frame Sync Algorithm\nThc operation of the acquisition and maintenance\nmodes of the frame sync algorithm are detailed in the\nflow diagrams of Figs. 1 and 2. A brief description of the\nalgorithm now follows to establish some notation that will\nhe needed later for the performance analysis.\nAssume that the transmitted information is organized\ninto M-bit frames composed of an L-bit Jync word followed by M - L statistically independent, cqually likely\ndata bits. The detected bit stream contains independent\nbit errors: a particular bit will be incorrect with probability F .\nLet the reccived bit stream bc represented by the\nbinary sequence rI, r2, r , . . . , and define an arbitritry\nJPL TECHNICAL RE#)RT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nL-tuple p,, = (r,,, r,n+l. . . ,r,,,+I,~l). frame s)nc objec.\nThe\ntive is to identify which of the pn,\xe2\x80\x99s are received frame\nsync words. When a binary PSK signal is demodulated\nusing a carrier reference derived from the modulated s i g\nnal, there is an inherent binary phase ambiguity in the\ndetector output: that is, the received bit stream can be\ninverted data (data)with probability %. Consequently, for\nlow bit error rates, if a particular p,,, is in fact a received\nsync word, its Hamming distance d,, from the transmitted\nsync word is equally likely to be near 0 or L. As indicated\nin Figs. 1 and 2, the algorithm threshold test reflects this\nproperty.\nSuppose the receiver is out of sync, and the acquisition mode is initiated. The overlapping L-bit received\nsequences p,, p-, p.<,. \xe2\x80\x98 . are examined in succession, and\nthe corresponding Hamming distances dl,d., d., . . . from\nthe sync word are computed. The algorithm uses two\nthrcshold tests: d,,,4 T,, d,,S L - TI (the latter indiand\ncating the detection of data). If it finds a sequence pk\nwhich satisfies eithor threshold test, and if the sequence\nplAM frame ahead satisfies the same threshold test,\none\nframe sync is established. That is, a hard decision is made\nthat pfi; is a received sync word. the data polarity is deduced accorditrg to which of the two threshold tests was\nsatisfied by pc; and p&M,and the maintenance mode is\nentered.\n\nIf the communication link consisted only ,,f a binary\nsymmetric channel, there would be no need for a frame\nsync maintenance mode. If bit synchronization could be\nmaintained perfectly Once frame sync was\na\nsimple bit counter could maintain frame sync indefinitely.\nUnfortunately, in practice, interface buffers within the\noverall communication link typically result in random\ndeletions and insertions of bits in the received data\nstream. It is the function of the frame sync maintenance\ninode to detect these occurrences, and to signal the resulting loss of frame sync.\nReferring to the flow diagram in Fig. 2, it is seen that\nthe data polarity decision made when frame sync was\nestablished confines the maintenance mode to one of the\ntwo threshold tests, a, 4T,and d, L - T,.\n,\n(Note that\nthe acquisition and maintenance modes use different\nthresholds in general.) In the acquisition mode, it was\ndecided that p l was a received frame sync word, since\n& and\nsatisfied the same T, threshold test. The\nmaintenance mode examines only presumed received\nsync words of the form p$+kY, where k is a positive integer. If T,h T,(see discussion below), d2 and &\n;\n+\nY\nmust\nsatisfy the T, threshold test; consequently, the mainte127\n\nnance mode can start with pfa+2y,as hdicated in the diagram. When two consecutive sequences that should be\nreceived sync words fail the threshold test, the receiver\nis declared to be out of sync, and the algorithm reverts to\nthe acquisition mode.\n\nin this article.) To maximize MTLS, T2 should be as large\nas possible; a threshold near L/4 is compatible with this\nobjective. In conclusion, T , should be near Lj4, and TI\nshould be closer to zero.\n\nThe following design objectives influence the selection\nof the thresholds T I and T,. For convenience, use the\nfollowing terminology:\n\n111.

However, for fixed values of E , L,\nand M, Pr[FS] decreases while MTS increases monotonically as TIdecreases, and the reverse condition also\nholds. So the selection of TI involves a tradeoff between\nFr [ F S ] and MTS. Typically T,is made relatively small,\nfavoring Pr [ F S ] , so that when a frame sync decisiob is\nmade, it: is likely to be correct. Fortunately, it will be evident in the numerical examples below that TI d m not\nhave to be too large for MTS to be near the minimum\nvalue of M.\nWith regard to the selection of T?, should be noir-cl\nit\nthat following the acquisition of frame sync, there are\ntwo situations that would cause the maintenance mode\nto decide that sync is lost. If one or more bits are e m\nneously deleted or inserted into the received data stream,\nthereafter, the received sync words would not coincide\nwith the L-bit sequences examined by the maintenance\nmode. If the sync word is a Barker (Ref. 1)or a NeumanHofman (Ref. 4) sequence, its correlation properties\nwould ensure that the Hamming distances of the L-bit\nreceived sequences from the sync word are likely to be\nnear L/2. In this case, a threshold T , on the order of L,/4\nwould be small enough to signal the loss of s y n On the\n~\ncriiier hand, if the channel state is such that no bit deletions or insertions are occurring, the maintenance mode\nwill still declare a loss of sync, falsely, if two consecutive\nreceived sync words contain more than T , bit errors. It is\nthii, circumstance, relating only to the binary symmetric\nchannel model, that is measured by the parameter MTLS\ndefined above.

This mode has\na frame length M = 7058 bits, and a sync word length\nL = 31 bits (a pseudo-noise or PN sequence). As the\nspacecraft-to-Earth range varies durh, the mission, SO\ndoes the bit error rate C; it is anticipated that during the\nprimary mission, E will not exceed MO. On this mission,\nthe acquisition and maintenance thresholds are identical,\nand are denoted by 7\xe2\x80\x99.For bit error rates in the range\n%J 4E L \xe2\x80\x98hoo, the frame sync algorithm performance is\nsummarized in Table 1. A single TV picture is composed\nof 700 frames of data; one of the design objectives in\nselecting T was that MTLS exceed 700, so that frame\nsync would be likely to be maintained over a TV picture.\nSubject to this c nstraint, as well as the threshold tradeoffs discussed earlier, the recommended vzlues of T are\ncircled in Table 1. It is evident from the table that if T is\nadjusted for changes in E, MTS will be near %, MTLS will\nexceed 700, while Pr [ F S ] is less than 2 X\nfor F less\nthan %.\n\nIV. Summary\nT i paper has considered the problem of acquiring\nhs\nand maintaining frame synchronization in uncoded PSK\ndata received over the binary symmetric channel. To this\nend, a practical algorithm was described that computes\nthe Hamming distances of L-bit segments of the received\n\nblc stream from the L-bit sync word, and applies these\ndistances to a threshold test.\nIn the acquisition mode, the algorithm ensures a reliable frame sync decision by requiring that two consecutive L-bit received sequences one frame apart satisfy a\nstringent threshold test. The maintenance mode is designed to flag the loss of frame sync due to random\ndeletions or insertions of bits in the received data stream;\nat the same time, its threshold test allows sufficient errors\nin the received sync words to pass so that the loss of sync\nis not likely to be declared falsely.\nThe performance of this algorithm was analyzed with\nthe aid of Markov models of the threshold test operation.\nAn upper bound for the probability of false sync acquisition, the mean time to sync acquisition, and the mean\ntime to loss of sync were computed as a function of the\nbit error rate, frame length, sync word length, and algorithm threshold values.\nThis algorithm is a generalization of the scherirc developed to provide frame synchronization on the Manner 10\nspacecraft-to-Earth telemetry link. As a numerical example, the derived formulas were used to predict the\nalgorithm performance for the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s high-rate,\nreal-time TV data mode.\n\nReferences\n1. Barker, R.

In Support o Section 331\nf\nA. PlanetaryRadar\nFor a total of five and one-half hours, DSS 13 supported\nf\nthc ranging o the planet Venus to gather data for use by\nthe MVM73 project. Pseudonoise (PN) code and code\nriming pulses were supplied, via microwave l n , t\nik o\nDSS 14 for use as a modulating signal for the uw)-kW\nRhD transmitter, and to synchronize the demodulating\n\nsystem. In addition to these ranging efforts, five and onehalf hours of special Mercury ranging were supported in\na similar fashion, with 10 data runs being completed.\nAdditionally, preliminary testing, with DSS 14 transmitting and both DSS 14 and DSS 13 receiting, of a proposed\n\xe2\x80\x98active VLBI\xe2\x80\x9d experiment was performed. This experiment, with Greenbank Radio Observatory as the cooperating station, is scheduled for early in 1974.\n\nB. Station Monitor and Control (RTOP-68)\n\nAs part of the work being done -der Researcb and\nTechnology Operating Plan 68 (RTOP-68). the SDS-930\ncomputer and DSS 13 2Bm antenna were used for six\nhours to amtinue testing of a developmental conical\n\nscanning antenna drive program destined to be used at\nDSS 14.\n\nII. In Support of Section 333\nA. Skysurvey\n\nUsing the noise adding radiometer (NAR) and the 26-m\nantenna in a fixed position( usually 180" az and 80-87" el),\ndata are collected on the total antenna system temperature as the Earth\'s rotation sweeps the antenna beam\nacross the sky. This observing, conducted automatically\nduring the hours when the station is closed (nights, holidays, and weekends) collected a total of 534 hours of data\nduring this period.\n6. Faraday Rotation\n\nIn anticipation of the launch of the MVM73 spacecraft,\nit was decided to provide backup for the single receiver\nbeing used to collect Faraday rotation data. Purchase\norders have been placed for two more receivers for evaluation but, pending their arrival, a receiver was obtained\non loa;- from Teledyne Corporation. After extensive\nmodification of the antenna previously used with the\nSmythe receiver, the Teledyne receiver was placed into\nservice and is currently collecting data. Stanford Research\nInstitute delivered and installed a second receiver but\nthe antenna drive mechanism failed and this receiver is\ncurrently not functioning. At the end of the period, both\nthe Teledyne and one Stanford receiver are collecting\ndata from .4pplications Technology Satellite 1 (ATS-l),\ndata that will be used by the MVM73 project to provide\nionospheric correction for the spacecraft ranging and\ndoppler data.\nC. WeakSource\n\nWith the reinstallation of the S-band radar operational\n(SRO) feedcone onto the DSS 13 26-m antenna and the\nrelocation of the maserhefrigerator from the electronics\nroom into this feedcone, the resulting low receiving\nsystem temperature has made it feasible to again measure\nthe strength of weak radio sources. Late in November this\nproject was resumed with 13 hours of data being collected\non radio sources 3C123,3C138,3C147,3C353,NGC7027,\nPO 237-23. and PO 2345-23.\nIn anticipation of full-scale resumption of the associated antenna gain measurement portion of this program,\nthe standard gain feedhorn was removed from the 26-m\nantenna and returned to Section 333 for examination and\ncalibration.\n138\n\n111. In Support of Section 335\nA. X-Band Radar (400 kw)\n\nThe first klystron (VA-949J) was installed into the\nmodified test bed and tested at a power output of just\nover 200 kW. During this testing, three directional couplers failed, two with overheated internal matching loads\nand one with water leaks in the cooling tubing. On\nDecember 6,1973, this first klystron apparently failed and\nwas removed from the test setup.\nA replica of the inside framework of a 64-m-type feedcone has been constructed at D S 13. A 2aal klystron\nS\npower amplifier with combiner, water loads, and couplers,\nas required for complete testing, will be constructed in\nthis replica. Available space is limited and integration of\nthe two klystron power amplifiers into the cone will be\ndifficult. Pending the availability of the actual feedcone,\nthis replica will enable construction, fitting, and testing\nto take place.\n6. Block IV Receiver/Excitcr\n\nWe continued to provide support to the installation\nand checkout of the Block IV receivedexciter at DSS 14.\nInstallation is now complete and, working until the configuration at DSS 14 was frozen for MVM73 launch,\ntesting and checkout were supported with a total of\n273 manhours. The Block IV receivedexciter is now partially operational and is being used to support MVM"73.\nC. Antenna Pointing (26-m)\nInasmuch as we were resuming normal receive capability operation, and reinstallation of the SRO feedcone\nmay have resulted in a change in the agreement of the\nradio frequency axis of the antenna with the mechanical\naxis, some test tracking was done with the scan and\ncorrect using receiver (SCOUR)computer program. In\nthree hours of tracking using Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A\nas sources, a new s e t of preliminary azimuth and elevation offsets was obtained for use during other tracking\nactivities.\n\nD. Receiving System Temperature Improvement (26-m)\nWith the completion of the first phase of the dual\nuplink carrier testing, it was felt that the maser/\nrefrigerator could be relocated from the electronics room\ninto the feedcone and thus improve the receiving system\ntemperature from 29 K to approximately 17 K at zenith.\nThis relocation was effected and the maser compressor\nwas aka reinstalled into the closed cycle refrigerator\nJPL TECHNICAL REFORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\n(CCR) room on the antenna (vice the outboard elevation\nbearing platform). Unfortunately this compressor soon\nfailed and was replaced by the spare. The failed unit has\nbeen repaired and is ready for reinstallation if necessary.\n\nIV. In Support of Section 391\nIn an investigation of its application to spacecraft\npositioning, a diff erential very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) experimcnt was carried out with Pioneer 10\nand a radio source as signal sources; the cooperating\nstations were DSS 13 and DSS 42. A total of 18% hours\non four separate passes were spent observing, in the VLBI\nmode, the spacecraft Pioneer 10 and radio source OW-174.\n\nDuring a routine checkout, the lW-kW DSN transmitter was discovered to be inoperational. With the\nassistance of the DSS 14 steff, DSS 13 personnel replaced\nthe klystron, socket tank and magnet, and restwed the\nsystein to operational condition. Due to schedule requirements at DSS 14, this work was accomplished during four\nconsecutive nighi operations.\nThe previously reported (Ref. 1) difficulty with reflected power on the R&D400-kW transmitter was found\nto be spurious signals caused by a defective radio\nfrequency connector in the input line to the frequency\nmultiplier. Replacement of this connector cleared up the\npoorly transmitted spectrum and full 400-kW operation is\nnow possible without reflected power \xe2\x80\x9ckickoffs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nC. Pioneer 10Tracking\n\nV. In Support of Section 422\nA. Clock SynchronizationTransmissions\nRegular clock synchronization transmissions have not\nyet been scheduled by DSN scheduling but special transmissions were made to DSSs 42 and 43. These transmissions, along with the regularly scheduled maintenance,\ndisclosed some system problems. Marginal radio frequency (RF) drive to the 100-kW klystron way corrpcted\nby replacement of the X 14 multiplier in the exciter chain.\nA synthesizer failcd and was replaced in the programmed\noscillator used for frequency control. A total of nine\ntransmissions have been made during the last two months.\n\nIf the tracking load at DSS 14 can be relieved, a\nplanetary radar experiment is planned with the comet\nKohoutek as a target. It is proposed that DSS 13 take\nover tracking Pioneer 10 for several days during early\nJanuary, 1974. In validation of DSS 13\xe2\x80\x99s capability to\nreceive good data, and with the cooperation of DSS 12\nfor telemetry reduction, a test track was made of\nPioneer 10 with the telemetry subcamer being transmitted to DSS 12 via the intersite microwave link. Good\ndata were obtained with the telemetry S/N ratio being\n2.5 from DSS 13 vs 2.8 with DSS 12 receiving.\n\nB. DSS 14 High-Power Transmitter Maintenance\n\nVI. In Support of Section 825\n\nIn preparation for the launch of the MVM\xe2\x80\x9973 spacecraft, the complex spare 20-kW klystron was installed at\nthe Microwave Test Facility and correct operation\nassured. Some minor tuning was accomplished, then the\nklystron, with a complete set of operational data, was\nshipped to DSS 14 in case of need.\n\nWith the closer approach of Pioneer 10 to Jupiter, a\nstepped-up level of radiation monitoring was provided\nfrom DSS 13. The radiation at 2295 MHz from Jupiter\nwas monitored for a total of 87.5 hours. Radio star calibrators, as tabulated in Table 1, were also observed for\n122 hours.\n\nReference\n1. Jackson, E.

K. Tucker\nR. F Systems Development Section\n.\n\nDesign efort wos started in A p d 1973 to dewlop and fabricate a high-speed\nswitch nwdtale for the Coherent Reference Generator Assembly. The major design\ngaal was to deoelop a high-speed switch capable of switching between frequency\nstandards in less than 400 M in the event of a primary standard failure, thus\nptooiding a constant failsafe I-MP: reference signal to the station cbcks. This\nreport reuiews the merd &sign and prouides a general memiew of the completed module.\nThe engineering model of the Coherent Reference\nGenerator Assembly (CRG)was installed and implemented at DSS 14 during July 1973. Included i this\nn\ninstallation was an engineering prototype of the 1-MHz\nclock reference switch module (switch module), which\nsupplies 1-MHz reference signals to the frequency and\ntiming subsystem (FTS)clock and timing circuits.\nThe following significant features of the Switch Module will be discussed in this report:\n(1) Design objective.\n\n(2) System application\n\n(3) Description.\n\n(4)Present status.\nJ R TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1528, Va xnt\n\n1. Design Objective\nThe major design objective for the switch module w s\na\nto provide a mutant 1-MHzreference to the station\nclock by automatically switching to a backup reference\nsource in less than 400 ns in the event of a primary\nsource failure.\n\nII. System Application (Fig. 1)\nInputs to the CHG are obtained directly from the\nstation frequency standards that, during the next few\nyears, may be two rubidium standards\n\n(Rb) or\n\ntwo\n\nhydrogen maser (HM)\nstandards.\nThe primary input ti, the FI\'S clock system from the\n\nCRG s a failsafe 1-MHzreference derived from either\n141\n\nthe present rubidium standards or the future ultrastable\nhydrogen maser standards. Once a class of standard is\nchosen (either ruhidium or hydrogen maser), the secondar). (ic backup reference is derived from the same\ngeneric type (;,e.,if hydrogen maser No. 2 is chosen as\nthe prime standard. I i ~ ~ r o g emaser No. 1 would be\nn\nthe backup unit).\nBoth the primary and sewndary standard 1-MHz\nreferences are made available to the FTS so that d plicate clocks can be operated for long-term stability an6\nstandard performance determination.\n\n111. Description (Fig. 2)\nThe switch module is housed in a standard Block IV\n\nRF module and has been designed to operate without\noperator adjustment or alignment.\nThe switch module has been designed with a \xe2\x80\x9cfailsafe\xe2\x80\x9d\ndc power system. In the event of a dc power loss from\nthe CRG power supplies, the module automatically\nswitchFs to a battery backup source located in the FTS,\nthus assuring coniinu,,J: 1-MHz references to the station clock.\nTwo input references are selected, within the module,\nby a solid-state multiplexer that is addressed externally\nby the CRG control and monitor panel. The multiplexer\xe2\x80\x99s\nlogic assures that the primary signal is obtained from the\nselected frequency standard and the secondary, or backlip, is derived from the other like standard.\nThe key idea of the overall switch design is to use\ndigital switching techniques to accomplish the highspeed switching. To accomplish this, both the primary\nand secondary standard inputs are passed through\nSchmitt triggers and converted to transistor-transistor\nlogic (TTL) levels,\nTo detect primary standard failure, two parameters\nmust be considered: (1) instantaneous signal presence,\nand (2) the average input power level.\nInstantaneous failure sensing and switching is accomplished through an unusual application of a zero crossover detector circuit, which consists of two voltage\ncomparator integrated circuits interconnected and biased\nto provide full 360-deg signal presence sensing of the\nprimary input signal.\n\nIf the input signal is present, the failure sensor remains\nat a logical \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9dlevel. If ti..: input signal should disappear\n142\n\nfor a time interval in excess of approximately 250 ns, the\nsensor output assumes a logical \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9clevel thus initiating a\nfailure mode signal. The 250-ns decision time is established by a simple resistor-capacitor (X)filter in the\nsensor output, which prevents switch operation on minor\nnoise disturbances.\nThe failure mode signal triggers a one-shot retriggrrable multivibrator circuit initiating the switching gate\nthat gates off the primary signal channel and enables\nthe secondary in its place. The transfer from primary to\nsecondary signal, after primary failure, is accomplished\nin less than 400 ns.\nThe one-shot multivibrator serves an essential function by assuring that once a failure has been sensed and\na transfer between standards effected, approximately a\note-half second delay is required before the circuit can\nrevert back to normal operation. This prevents the switch\nfrom chattering on an intermittent input signal.\nAverage power sensing and switching are accomplished\nby measuring the primary input powcr with a signal\nlevel detector. If the input power remains above a preset level of approximately +9 dBm, the primary level\nsense signal remains at a logical \xe2\x80\x9c1.\xe2\x80\x9d If, however, the\ninput level falls below this preset level, the prir. .ary\nlevel sense signal assumes a logical \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9d state initiating a\nswitching gate to disable the primary channel and enable\nthe secondary in its place.\nLevel monitor logic is also designed to provide continuous module status information to the CRG control\nand monitor panel. Input and output signal power levels\nare monitored in individual level detector circuits and\nare compared in an exclusive \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d circuit. If inputs are\nabove the preset level of approximately + 9 dBm, output\ne\nfrom ihc module must also be present and ai. w +9\ndBm, or the module \xe2\x80\x9coutput failure\xe2\x80\x9d signal will be\ninitiated. If no inputs are present or they fall below the\n+9-dBm level, outputs are not expected and only the\n\xe2\x80\x9cinput failure\xe2\x80\x9d signals will be initiated.\n\nThe TTL signals are filtered at the switch output to\nprovide sine wave outputs, at nordnal %-ohm impedance, so that no changes to the existing FTS are required.\n\nIV. Status\nDocumentaYon is complete and the first production\nmodel of the switch module has been built and tested\nIvstallation at DSS 14 wiil be accomplished as soon as\nthe station operational freeze is lifted.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL.

Introduction\nThe purpose of this artirlr is to describe the experimental setup and preliminary results of a time-scaled\nsimulaticn of a convolutionally ccded, sequentially decoded. coherent telernetry liik. The need for such an\napproach arose when it becime necessary to\nle the\nHelios project as well as future Pioneer projec. with an\naccurate estimate of link performance and design tradeo f at medium data rates.

Finally, scaling up of the\nsimulations to a higher speed than under normal operating conditions is necessary in order to accumulate the\nrequired amount of statistical data 111 a reasonable length\nof hme. For example, to establish with reasonable confidence a bit error probability of l(r requires about\n10s bits. To gather this amount .._ at 100 bits/s would\ndata\ntake over 10 days. Similarly, establishing a block erasure\nprobability (decoder wedow) of le3 blocks of loo0\nfor\nbits, would take 10 days.\n\nII. Scaling the Tests\nThe block diagram in Fig. 1 depict3 the system elements\nwhich require modification to provide a high-speed\nversion of actual behavior at normal operating conditions.\nIt is assumed that the front end noise is wideband, with\na oae-sidJ spectral density N,. Primed variables denote\nscaled versions of the normal iinscded quantities, and x\n+ w t e s the scale factor. There are several ways to achieve\nthe required scaling of the system dynamics. The method\nwe selected may be described as follows:\n\nN: = N o\n,-5= XP,\n\nWideband noise level unchanged\n\nR\' = x R\n\nBit rate scaled up\n\nt\nu\n:\n,\n\n= XWL\n\nTotal signal power scaled up\nLoop bandwidth s c a l d up\n\nf =r\n\nDamping ratio unchanged to preserve relative dynamics\n\n\' =a\na\n\nLimitersuppressim factor unchanged\nto preserve relative dynamics\nPrefiltqr bandwidth increase required\nto mpintain the same input signal-tonoise ratio (SNR)to the limiter for\na? ---\n\nu\n\nLoop SNR unchanged\nBit SNR unchanged\nModulation index unchanged\nLoop filter time constants reduced\nLoop gain increased\nThe above quantities obey &e following relationships,\nwhich are documented by Tausworthe (Ref. 2)\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nand\na = 4pH)\n\nwhere\npfr = (1- m2)PT/Nowrr\n\nm = sin 8, where 6 is the modulation angle\n\nInserting the scaled parameters into the above formulas\nwill verify that all the scale changes are achieved and the\nrelative dynamics preserved where necessary.\nTiiiw-scaling of the subcarrier demodulator and symbol\nsynchronizer assemblies (SD.4 and SSA) is accom2lished\nthrough switch-selectable operating modes which match\nthe actual (Le., upscaled) daia rates. Moreover, the loss^\nin these assemblies are small and relttively insensitive to\nrate changes.\n\nIll. Test Techniques\nThr agproach followed in evaluating the scaled-time\ntelemetry test capability. must minimize the test time\nrequired to build confidence in the correctness of the\nscaled parameters. The first tests therefore measured the\nglohaI static PLL parameters, limiter suppression a, and\nphase jitter variance u&, at specific signal stre* gths and\ncompared these measurements with published results for\nthe 12-Hz DSN PLL. Dynamics cf the PLL behavior\nalso influence strongly the performance of medium-rate\ntelemetry, necessi\'-ting their measurement, in the form\nof the phase jitter :ocorrelation function. In this case,\nboth the 12-Hz DaN PLL and the scaled PLL had to be\nmeasured, as the desired parameters wcre not geneally\ndocumented.\n\n.\n\nThe ultimate criterion f o r acceptance of the results of\nthe scaled telemetry tests is, of course, the equivalence of\nmeasured telemetry pertormance in both normal and\nscaled-time modes. This is most economically used at\nthe mid-range data rates only (e.g., 128 bit&), where\nreasonable duration tests can define the system performance. The anticipated plan is to tmt at 128 bits/s over\na set o modulation indices near optimum, and to spotf\ncheck many data rates at oiie very high modulation\nindex. For each data rate c!wcked in this fashion, the\nmodulation inder will be set wfficiently high for the\n145\n\nnoisy carrier reference to be the dominant source of noiscb,\nand so that performance is poor enough to be measured in reasonable time .vithol;t sca!irig. The total received power level will be set high enough so that\nthe dcsircd lei deletion probability could bc achieved\nwith a lower niodulation indes. -2 successful match of\npiformancc at the high mod-index will, of course, indicate that the noisy reference losses are correctly scaled.\nSince we belive that the additive receiver noises will scale\ncorrectly, successful high inod-index comparison should\nalso indicate overall success of the scaled test setup. Some\nprior test data (Ref. 3) esist for normal-time test: of performance near the optimum mod-index which can be\ncompared against the scaled tcsts to identify any unexpected errors in the scaling assumptions.\nNo plans esist presently to test the scaled-time test configuration for uiicoded tclc~n~tr)..\nSince performancr of\nsequential decoding is very critically dependent upon\nthe adjacent-symbol correlation of the carrier reference\nnoise, correct scaled-time performance of sequential\ndecoding almost certainly implies that scaled-time tests\nof uncoded telemetry will also be correct. Future users\nof the scaled-time test capability for uncoded data will,\nof course, have the option of accepting this hypothesis\nor performing whatever additional tests they might need\nto validate the scaled-time performance for uncoded\ntelemetry.\n\nIV. The Scaled Loop Hardware Design\nand Initial Testing\nThe preceding sections have shown that, by scaling the\nreceiver 12-Hz loop bandwidth, statistical data on bit\nerror rates can be 7btained in a time inversely proportional to the scaling number N used on the receiver. It\nwas decided to scale the ipceiver loop bandwidth by 16,\na factor which allowed a reascnable improvement in the\nspeed of data acquisition WithoLt causing the data rates\n\xe2\x82\xacor the faster bit rates to exceed the capabilities of the\ntelemetry decoding cquipment.\n\nvalues of R,, R,, and C in 11 standard DSN cracking filter\nmodule to provide the new time canstants. The only\nother hardware inodification required w a s the predetection filter amplifier. The b;ind\\\\.idth (BCV) of this anipiifier must be scaled (increased) by the scaling number N.\nFor this test, the bandwidth w a s increased from the\nnormal 12-Hz loop value of 2 kHz to the new cdue of\n32 kHz noise BW. The hardware implementation consists\nof a four-stage, synchronously tuiied amplifier. (The gain\no this filter amplifier must be the same as that of the\nf\nnormal amplifier in order not to disturb the automatic\ngain control (.4GC) performance of the receiver). For\nfuture esperiments, the predetection filter could be a\ncommercial crystal filter. This would enable tighter control of the bandwidth behveen units, as well as better\nbandwidth stability vs. trmperature. The changc \xe2\x80\x99 modules nre identified in Fig. 3.\nIn order to verify that the receiver bandwidth had been\nproperly scaled, several experiments were run. \xe2\x80\x99nput\ncarrier power was set for all tests by the Y-Factor Tecnnique (Ref. 4). First, the limiter suppression (u) characteristic was checked by measuring carrier power at the\nlimiter output vs. loop threshold margin. This measurement was performed by a coherent amplitude detector\nand vacuum tube volt meter (VTVM). The results of the\ntest can be seen in Fig. 4. Ideally, the scaled and unscaled a C U N ~ S should be identical. If the a characteristic\nlevels off at a lower margin in thz scaled case, it vvould\nprobably indicate an I F amplificr or limiter of insufficient\nbandwidth, or an insufficient noise bandwidth iv *he\npredetectim filter amplifier. (If high-scaling numb.m are\nmal, it may be necessary to increase the BW of t h e I F\namplifiers. This will prevent their influencing the predetection bandwidth, which should ideally be determined\nsolely by the predetection filter amplifier). Since the\ncurves for the scaled and unsca!ed cases are nearly\nidentical, it appears that the predetection filter is indeed\nthe determined BW, as desired.\nThe second test consisted of measuring the phase jitter\n(&) of the receiver voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)\n\nFor the scaling number under consideration (16), it\nwas necessary only to scale the tracking filter and the\npredetection filter. (If extremely high scaling numbers\nare used, it may be necessary to increase the bandwidth\nof the IF amplifiers). Since Bt is being scaled, it can be\nand 7 2\nshown that it is necessary to decrease T , by\nby N:where t l = R,C and t? = (R, + RJC in Fig. 2. For\nthe case being evaluated (N = le), T , b m e s 9.887 s\nand T~ becomes 8.5 X\ns. The hardware implementation of the tracking filter consisted of modifying the\n146\n\nas a function of margin. These data were obtained by\nemploying the test translator as a signal source, and the\nUHF doppler detector as a dual phase detector, which\nallowd measuring the variance of the phase noisc\npresent on the VCO. The test configuration for this mea.\nsurement is shown in Fig. 3 The UHF doppler signal\n(zero doppler + phase jitter) is phase d&ected against\nthe station frequency standard. The phase shifter is required to set the reference phase in quadrature (to enable\nFhase detection), with either of the two signals being\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL XIX\n\nphastl cletwtd in the dual phase detector. (The other\nsignal is being amplitudch dvtwttd.) For Ydch data point\n(valuc of margin), both channels are sampled and\nrecorded by thc digital instrumentation system ( DISI.\nTht, n t for sanlplinq both channels arises \\vhcn a cycle\ned\nslip occurs. For each cycle slippcd at S-band, there\nappears a 90-dcg shift in the phase at the W I F doppler\ncktvctor. (This is due to ;3 X 4 multiplication behveen\nthe point at which the L\xe2\x80\x99HF doppler is extracted and the\nS-band local oscillator output.) Therefore, if a cycle is\nslipped, the channel that was phase detecting is now\namplitude detecting and vice versa. To prevent loss of\nphase data following cycle slip, both channels are\nrcmrdccl. \\Vhen the tapes are FrOCeSSed, only the channel that is phase detecting is uscd. From those data, the\nvariance ( 0 : ) is calculated. As can In. seen in Fig. 5, the\nd a b follow wry closely those obtained with the normal\nE-Hz loop. This further indicates that thc rewiver seems\nto be properly scald.\nThe third test consisted of taking the autmrrelation of\nthe phase jitter data. Each autocori-lation plot shows\nthe time response of the loop at a particular margin. By\nplotting T from each of these plots vs. margin, a plot is\nobtained that illustrates loop rpsponse vs. margin. Figure\n6 is such a plot for both the scaled and unscaled loops.\nIf the loop is properly scaled, the scaled loop will have\na value of T equal to 1/N of the unscaled loop at each\nmargin. For convenience, the time ( 7 ) scales of the two\nJata sets shown in Fig. 5 are scaled by the scaling\nfactor A\xe2\x80\x99. Therefore, the two curves will coincide if the\nloop is properly scaled. A s can be seen. there is very close\nagreement between these hvo curves.\nThe results of this group of three tests seem to indicate that the receiver loop bandwidth was indeed scaled\nthe desired amount over the r a q e of loop margins considered.\n\nV. Telemetry Tests\nTesting of the scaled-time telemetry test capability\nusing sequential decoding requires that ceveral decoding\ntest runs be performed using both the 192-Hz loop and\nthe 12-Hz DSN receiver at identical (scaled equivalent)\ntest ccnditions. To be convincing, these test runs must\ncover the rangc of data rates, SNRs, and modulation\nindices for which scaled tests are expected to be used. The\nscaling can be used at data rates of 256 symbols cr\nsrmnd (SPS) (scaled to 4096 SPS) and lower. At scaled\n512 SPS (8192 SPS) an4 above, the data decoder assembly\n(DD.4) cannot operate succ:ssfully.\nJPL TECHNICAL REWRT 32.1526. VOL. XIX\n\nThe test configuration for sequential decding testing\nwith scaling is sho\\vn in Fig. 7. It is identical to the configurations ut for normal DSN tcsting of sequential\nsd\ndtvoding for Pioneer or Helios, rsccpt that the receiver\nniodules for the 192-Hz loop arc substitutcd for those of\nthe 12-Hz DSS receiver PLL. The output from the test is\ns map+c. t a p orisinal data record (ODR) containing,\nfor each data frame processed by the DD.4, the number\nof decoding computations which were used in processins\nit. These ODR tapes are later analyzed off-line to determine the cumulative distribution of computations, which\nis then used to evaluate system performance. In tht DSS\nstation, the tests require the use of the sinw\xe2\x80\x99ation conversion assembly (SC.\\), the test transmitter. the antenna\nmicrowave assemid;., the Y-factor assembly. a receiver\nand SDA. t\\vo telenietq/command processors (TCPs)\nwith SS.4s. and one DD.4. The TCP-DDA4SA string\noperates under control of nonstandard DSIF softwarethe DDA stand-alone-TCP verification program-and\nprovides the ODR end-product of the tests. The second\nTCP-SSA4 string operates with the Ylariner Mars 1971\n( M S I X ) Test Program No. DOI5087-T\xe2\x82\xac and acts as a\nmonitor for the telemetry channel, to ver \xe2\x80\x98y station setup\naccuracy and identify drifts in parame1,:rs.\nThe SCA provides a pseudo-random t lata sequence for\nthe test transmitter. The subcarrier frequency used is\n2,W3 Hz, and data rates of interest range from 16 to\n4096 SPS. The biphase-modulated subcarrier in turn\nphase-modulates the carrier at the test transmitter, with\na modulation inclen which may vary from , to 75 deg,\n%\ndepending upon data rate and other factors. This simulated telemetry signal is then processed by the station\nreceiving equipment, much like the signal from a spacecraft. The \xe2\x80\x9creceived signal strength is set as required\nusing the Y-fa;tor measurement technique (Ref. 4) prior\nto the start of a test. The modulation indices are set by\nprecision attenuators. Extreme care is required in this\nsetup because of the sensitivity of decoding performance:\nthe decoding erasure rate can vary by an order of magnitude with a 0.5-dB change in signal strength. After setup,\nthe Test Program 5087 output monitors charr,rel statistics,\nand when stable operation of the receiver and SDA is\nobserved, the TCP/DDA program is activated to develop\nthe ODR of decoder perfomlance. The format of these\nODR tapes is shown in Fig. 8.\nTests with the scaling test facility have been performed\nand the data analyzed for a real data rate of 25 SPS\n.6\n(scaled for 4096 SPS). The signal strength was set to that\nwhich would provide an STJN, of 2.7 dB at 45-deg\nmodulation index for both scaled and nonscaled tests.\nThis value will produce an erasure rate of between 1W\n147\n\nand 1 W at the opnmum modulation index. Figure 9\nshows t h c x results of tests at several modulation indices.\nThe computation distribution curve shown is a rather\nsensitive measure of channel behavior. The minor differences between comparable curves are well within the setup tolerance on the system, believed to be on the order of\n0.4 dB. The high mod-index cw-es (70 deg) are interesting in that the carrier reference losses are the dominant\nnoise source at this point. If the camer reference losses\nfailed to scale properly, we would expect it to be evident\nfrom these curves; since there is agreement, we conclude\nthat the scaling of the 2.56-SPS data rate is successful. We\nexpect this siiccess to be repeated at lower data rates, but\ntests must yet be performed, lest some unexpected interference signal, or sbme other nonscaled or nonsalable\nartifact of the DSN receiver/SDA/SSA systems, contribo\nute a larger than expected share t the telemetry system\nlosses.\n\nVI. Summary and Future Plans\nThis article has described the motivation for, and development and initial testing of, a scaled-time telemetry test\n\ncapability. The immediate need for this capability is to\nestablish the sequei1ti;i\xe2\x80\x99 decoding perfomlance of the\nDD.4 for Helios and Pioncur, and the present tests have\nbeen aimed at evaluating the suitability of the scaled\nPLL for this task. The relevant parameters of liniitcr\nsuppression, phase jitter \\-ariame, and phase jitter autocorrelation have been measured, and no discrepancy was\nfound behvcen the X16-scaled PLL and the 1.7-Hz loop\nof the DSN 1,ceiver. Comparative sequential decoding\ntests have also been performed for lB-bit/s data; no\ndiscrepancy \\vas found between scaa ? and unscaled h r formance at any modulation index either near-optimum\nor high (70 deg), where the carrier reference noise is\ndominant.\nFurther testing will be performed of the scaled-time\ntelemetry test capability, and productive use made of it,\nat DSS 71, where longduration tests are in progress to\nestablish DDA performance. At each of the Helix data\nrates where x d h g can be used, a ven- high mddationindex comparison test will be run to verify the scaling of\nnoisy reference losses before the planned tests of several\nmod-indices and power levels are run.\n\nReferences\n1.

Anderson\n\nThis article describes the Network Control System (NCS)Standard Computer\nlnterface hardware, including the interface cable, the line drioers, line receitiers\nand line terminating network. I t describes in corrciidrrable detail the timing\nspecificcrtions for the interface timing control signals for continuous &a transfer\nas weU a for asynchronous byte transfer. A set o f control logic which complies\ns\nwith these timing specifications has been designed for and succcssfuUy checked\nout in connection with the Star Switch Controller (SSC). This control logic, which\nincludes .ynchronizationand noise filter operations, is described in detail. Trans~\nfer rates for uariablr table lengths a r listed.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe NCS standard computer interface hardware contains 14 parallel data-transmission lines. Eight of these\nlines are data lines, four are timing and control lines,\nand two are function lines (see Fig. 1\'\nOf the interface timing control lines for asynchronous\ndata transmission, two are unidirectional request line;,\none in each direction; onc is a bidirectional half-duplex\nresponse line; and one is a bidirectional half-duplex ready\nlint. The linear bit operation of these lines and the\noperation of the control logic to perform these operations\nis specified in detail. The control logic synchronizes the\ninput signals to the local service clocks, and filters out\nspurious noise pulses of short duration, Both the control\n\n152\n\nlogic and its operation are described in detail, as are the\ncable, line drivers, receivers, and line termination.\n\n11. Cable, Drivers, Receivers, and Line\nTermination\nThe NCS standard interface cable is a twisted pair\ncable, with line drivers and line receivers, as shown in\nFigs. 2 and 3. \'I ne cable itself is shown in Fig. 4. All connectors, physically and functionally, mate with connectors n r h JS that shown in Fig. 4. Pin assignments for the\ntiming control lines, data lines, and function lines are\nalso shown in Fig. 4. (Figures 2, 3, and 4 are taken from\nJPL Specification ESSO%\'M A, May 1973, a JPL internal\ndw ,In.*.Tit.)\n\nAs shown in the figures, twisted pair, #%-gauge, 100-n\nlines are used. The drivers are 7438 open collector, high\ncurrent TTL-buffer, 2-input NAND-gates, and the receivers are regular 7400 NAND inputs. Both ends of the\nlines are terminated with 150 R to +5V and 330 R to\nground. The common term is terminated on the CND pin\nof the drivrr and receiver chip, respectively.\n\n111. Signal Sync and Noise Filter\nIn order to combat noise and to synchronize the interface timing control signals with the internal service clock\nof the computer, a signal transition is recognized only\nupon the second consecutive sample of the internal clock.\nThis specification is valid for transitions in either direction. Stated differently, a single noise pulse of either\npolarity of a duration of less than two clock periods\noccurring at any time will have no &ect on the true\noperation of the line receiving logic.\n\nIV. Timing Control Line Operation\nFigure 1 shows the selected set of computer interface\ntiming control lines together with eight data lines. The\nrequest-to-transmit line is unidirectional, while the return\nresponse and data lines are half-duplex bidirectional.\nFor ;-ici.t ectional communication, two request-to-transmit\nlilies are theri required, one in each direction, as shown.\nfl\xe2\x80\x99ip,wc 5 is a simple block diagram and timing chart\nwbch show. the detailed operation of the timing control\nlines \xe2\x80\x98R;e Arne sequence for the various control lines,\nwhirh is ripeated for each linear bit or parallel byte, is\nlisted as fo lows:\nAn oidxmnd request line is asserted by the transmitting <,-vice.\nThe assertion of an inbound request line is sampled\nand synchronized by the recipient device.\n\nThe synchronized inbound request signal causes\nassertion of the outbound return response line.\nThe return response line inbound to the transmitting device is sampled and synchronized and\nf\ncauses assertion o the outbound ready line.\nThe ready signal inbound to the recipient device\nis sampled and synchronized, and used to form a\ndata-strobe pulse for sampling the received data.\n\n(6)\nUpon sampling the received data, the inbound\nready signal is used to turn off the outbound\nresponse line.\nJPL TECHN?CAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\n(7) Turnoff of the outbound responsc line will in turn\ncause turnoff of the inbound rcady line.\n(8) Turnoff of the inbound ready line will again cause\nthe outbound response line to turn on, conditional\non the request linc. being on, for receiving of the\nnext character.\n(9) At the end of a block transmission, the request\nline is turned off by the transmitting device simul-\n\ntaneously with the ready line, outbound from the\ntransmitting device, for the last character being\nturned on.\nA. Control Logic Operation\n\nThe operation of a signal synchronizing and noise\ncontrol receiving register for thc transmission interface\ntiming controI signals, in general, and for the ready line\nregister, in particular, is specified as follows:\n(1) A signal change is recognized only if the signal\nremains in its new state for two consccutive clock\n\nperiods after the signal has remained in its prior\nstate for at least two clock periods.\n\n(2) A data strobe will be generated only for a unidirectional change of the input signal.\n(3) Once a data-strobe pulse has begun to form, it will\nbe completed independently, and the fact that it\nwas completed will be independently reported.\nIndependently, as used here, implies independence\nof what is happening on the input signal line.\n(4) A noise spike of either polarity of a duration less\nthan two clock periods occurring at any time must\n\nnot be the cause of a double data-strobe pulse, nor\nshould such a noise spikc interrupt the forming of\na data-strobe pulse or the subsequent r e p r t signal\nthat a data-strole pulse -.vas formed.\n\nB. Request Line Sync Register\nFigure 6 shows the interface timing control logic. The\nlogic is implemented with a SN5495 universal 4-bit, shiftright, parallel-load register with no additional gating.\nThe input signal is used as a mode control and the\nparallel entries are connected so that the register, when\nit is in the parallel load mode, will shift left. The shiftright/shift-left data entries are fixed-wired as \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9c0,\xe2\x80\x9d respectively. The desired output level is achieved\nby correlating the input mode control signal with the\n.i.\nfixed -vid data inputs; e.g., SR = 1, SL = 0, or vice\nversa.\n\nThe output of stage C will change state only if thr\noutput line has been stable for two consecutive clock\npulscs, as described. This is true for transitions in either\ndirection, and it is true in general. There are however,\ntwo spclc.ial cases in which it is not true, and that is if the\nline reverses again bt.t\\vcwn the first and second or the\nstwnd and third clock pulses following a transition.\nThe probability of this special case occurring is deemed\nexceedingly low. The output from stage B is used directly\nas the response term, conditional only on a ready register\nterm. Thth reason that the direct connection is acceptable,\nas opposed to the use of an intermediate storage device,\nis that when the request line is turned off at the same\ntime that the ready line is turned on, for one character\ntransfer or for the last character in a block, the turnoff\nof the responsc line, which in turn causes the ready line\nto turn off, occurs at the same tiwe that the data-strobe\npulse begins to dcvelop. The request line register and\nthe ready line register are connected in much the same\nmanner. Furthermore, if the same type of interface logic\nis used at bcth the transmitting and receiving ends, there\nis the added sync delay at the transmitting end between\nits inbound response line turnoff and the time that its\noutbound ready line is turned off. Stated differently, the\nrcquest line turns off the response line, which in turn\nturns off the ready line. Whether it is for a single character transfer, or for the last character, ihe response line\nis turned off sooner than for a character within a block,\nwhere it is turned off at the end of the data-strobe pulse.\nThe ready line is still turned off one clock period later\nthan completion of the data-strobe pulse.\nC. Ready Line Sync Register\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the ready register is connected to\nshift right in either of its modes. The parallel load entries\nare connected to shift right; however, with mrtain modifications. The input signal is used as mode control; the\ndata entry for shift right in thc serial mode is a fixed 0\nand for shift right in the parallel-load mode a fixed 1.\nBy shifting in one direction only, the vector that generates the data strobe is automatically generated for a\nunidirectional signal change only. The external gating\nshown ill Fig. 2 is intended primarily to prevent oneclock-period noise pulses from generating or regenerating the strobe pulse, or to interfere with its forming, or\nwith the reporting of its having been formed.\nAs shown in the truth table (Fig. 7), the strobe pulse\ncondition is ABC and the strobe pulse completion report\n\n154\n\ncondition is BC, both of \\vliich can occur only for the\nspecified conditions. I n relation to the truth table, :he\nready register connection shown in Fig. 2 is dcrivcd\nfrom the following arguments: \\i7hen the input signal\nis a 1, a 1 is entered to the shift-right connected entry of\nthe register. \\Vhen the signal is a 0, a \xe2\x80\x9c0\xe2\x80\x9d is entered to\nthe serial input of the internally connected shift-right\nregister. The content in B is always entered to C, while\nthe entry to B is a function of the signal and the content\nof the register. The signal is thc mode-control term, and\nwhen it is 0, the shift register is internally connected for\nshift right. What is in A will. in this mode, always be\nshifted to B. When the signal is a 1, c \xe2\x80\x9c1\xe2\x80\x9dis entered to the\ninput of the shift register, which in this mode is connected esternally to shift right to allow for vector modification. Thus, in this mode, what is in A is shifted into\nB in all instances except one: the 011 condition, in which\ncase. a 1 is entered to B instead of the 0 in A.\nD. Response-Ready Register Time Share\n\nThe response and ready lines are both bidirectional\nbut are always energized from opposite ends; the request\nline is always energized first and the response line second. This allows time-sharing a single synchronizing\nreceiving register between these two lines, as shown in\nFig. 8. (Figures 1, 5, 6 7 and 8, are takvn from JPL\nSpecification ES508535 A, Appendix, a JPL internal\ndocument.) Also shown in the figure are the stepring\ngates for time-sharing of the ready-response register\nthrough the synchronized request line. The same line is\nalso used for added interlock of the outbound response\nline and the outbound ready line.\nThe control logic described here is duplicated in each\nend of a transmission path.\n\nV. Data Transfer Rates\nThe bit transfer rate for different length cables has\nbeen tabulated using the type of interface described\nhere, where the assertion and/or release of a line is\nrecognized only on the second clock pulse of an internal\nS-hIHz service clock, and using identical interface logic\nat both ends, with individual service clocks (Table 1).\nA cable delay of 5.90 ns/m is used, and a double roundtrip per byte for continuous transmission is consiclered.\nThe cable length has been limited to 152.4 m so that the\nsignal attenuation will not cause a marginal operation.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL.

McClure\n\nDSlF Digital Systems Development Section\n\nThe outages experienced on the present Ground CommuniaationsFacility (CCF)\n48Wbits/s high-speed &to wbsysten hatie been examined. An outage is defb* I\nas any interval when 10 01 more conrecutfoe high-speed data (HSD) blocks were\nreceitied in err0101 were not receioed at all. For a 3-month period in 1973, outages\nranged from 2.5 s to 4.8 h in length. The median outage wos 15 s. Apprmhately\n16!Z of the outages exceeded 1 min, and only I.% exceeded 15 min duration.\n\n1. Introduction\n\n11. Outages\n\nThe GCF provides high-speed data transmission at a\nrate of 4800 bits/s, using NASCOM circuits and Western\nElectric IEOiJA data sets. Data are divided into 1200-bit\nblocks, transmitted at four blocks per second. If no data\nare available for transmission, the GCF generates and\nsends filier blocks in order to keep the circuit active and\nprovide block synchronous operation. Before transmission,\nan error detection code is calculated and included in the\nblock. At the receiving end, a GCF decoder checks the\nreceived code and sets status bits if transmission errors\nare present. If blocks are not received at all, the decoder\ngoes out of lock (into search) for an integral number of\nblock times until flow is re-establiqhed. The receive cldta\nset carrier failure signal also comes on d u n g local circuit\nfailures.\n\nFor this study, an outage was defined as any interval\nwhen 10 or more consecutive HSD blocks were received in\nerror or not received at all. Intervals of less than ten blocks\nwere considered to be error bursts. This definition is a bit\narbitrary; however, 10 block times (2% is an improbably\nlong error burst, hence there is some justification for this\nchoice.\n\nThe information available from the CCF decoder has\nbeen studied to determine the distribution of the outages\nrm\nexperienced in the data forwarded f o the DSSs to JPL.\nJPL TECHNICAL R E M 3 . 21\n\nVa XIX\n\nI\n\nFor outage study purposes, slightly less than three\nmonths of 1973 data were analyzed. These data were collected f o the normal HSD operational circuits during\nrm\nregular tracking passes. No attempt was made to sort the\ndata, thotigh some data reflecting equipment malfiindions\nwere discarded.\nOutages ranged from IS blocks (2% s), to 17,513 blocks\n(4.8 h) in length, with long outages being in the minority.\nTable 1 lists outage parameters for each of the DSS g e e\n161\n\ngraphical areas, plus a total of all four DSS a r m . Information on the performance of the Ames-JPL circuits is\nalso ;hown.\nAs indicated in the tabulation, the median outages\nranged from 58 to 63 blocks (14.5 to 15.75 s), a very close\nspan considering the widely different transmission distances involved.\n\n111. Distribution\nThe outage distribution for the combined DSSs is shown\nin Fib. 1.On this plot, the abscissa indicates the percentage\no the outages which had lengths equal to or less than the\nf\nX-wordinate value. For instance, 71%of the outages were\n100 blocks or less in length.\n\n162\n\nThe abrupt breaks in the curves in the 30-and 50-block\nareas are caused by data set retrain characteristics. When\na high data ?nor rate condition occurs, the transmit and\nreceive data sets intempt the data flow and perform an\ninternal readjustment sequence to compensate for changed\ncircuit conditions. These interruptions cause data outages.\nThe GCF has a current commitment to restore seMce in\n15 min or less. As measured, only 1 5 of the outages ex.%\nceed 3600 blocks (15 min). In fact, only If%of the outages\nexceed 1 min (240 blocks). A different definition of an\noutage would vary these findings; however, the GCF is\ndefinitely meeting its restoral commitment.\nA future report will dlscuss the burst characteristins of\nfaulty blocks.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL RERWIT 32-1526, VOL.

The PRA installation was necessu). because\nthe Mark 1A lunar rangirrg cannot operate at the signal\nlevels received from spacecraft travelbg at planetdistances. The range data are used to improve :he spacecraftorbit prediction and to provide information concerning the charged particle con:mt o space in the path\nf\nbetween the ground station a t d the spacecraft.\nThe phnetar>. ranzitid as.errlbly contains digital hardware that performs qxxial control and dak collecting\nfurtdions and a s a l general purpose computer that\nml\nhandles scheduling, computation, and data h a t t i n g .\nThe PRA is part of a ranging system that measures the\nie f\nrm\nround-trip t m o a radio signal which trawls f o a\nground tracking station to B spaceaaft and back. A d t d\nJPL TECHNICAL\n\n3-21\n\nWK. XIX\n\nsignal is modulated on an S-band carrier and transmitted\nto the spacecraft, which detects a i d rekdnsmits the signal\nto the tracking ,*tion. The signal received at the tracking\nstation is delayed in time by its mid trip through space\nand is shifted in frequency by the doppler dect because\nof the relative motion between the spacecraft and tracking\nstation. The delay is measured by synchronizing a local\nmodel of the code with the transmitted code and then\nshifting it into alignment with the received signal. In order\nto detect alignment between ths local code (receiver code)\nand the received signal, it is neceSSary to clock the receiver\nd e r at the same bit rate that is present on the received\nsignal. T i is accomplished by adding the frequency\nhs\nofbet due to the L,ppler deet to the clock frequency 3f\nthe transmitted signal. The doppler signal derived fmm\nthe S-band carrier is SCP\' \' md uwd for this purpose.\nAlthough the scaling is exact, there is a slow driit between\nthe receiver d e r and the received signal because the\ncarrier and the modulation are not delayed by the m e\n146\n\namount when they pass through a medium containing\ncharged particles. This difference, called diffrrenced range\nvs integrated doppler (DRVID),is mt.asured and output\nas a data type.\nThe PRA operates at much lower received signal levels,\nand therefore at greater distances, than the lunar ranging,\nprimarily because it is implemented to use the camer\ndoppler signal to keep the receiver coder in step with the\nreceived signal, rather than extracting the d e r clock\ndirectly from the signal. Performance has also been improved by optimizing the ranging code to improve the\nefficiency of detection, and employing a computer to\nnurr,erically average the received signa! 2nd thus extend\nthe signal range over which useful information can be\nrecovered.\nThe elements of the PRA that communicate with the\ncomputer do so using the DSIF Standard 14-line interface. This computer interface is designed to transfer data\nreliably over relatively long distances in the electrically\nnoisv environnient of t5e trackhig station. The use of a\nstandard interface makes the equipment &.sign independent of the computer assigned to it and enables equipment\nconfigurations to be changed more easily.\nThe PR.4 provides capability for ranging with either an\nS-hand receiver or an S-band receiver by using the doppler signal from each receiver to generate a clock signal.\nEither of these clocks may be selected to drive the receiver\ncoder; the other one automatically drives a clock generator\nwhich permits measurement of DRVID only using the\nreceiver not selected for ranging.\n\'4 fixed-frequency relationship must exist between the\n\ntransmitter coder frequency and the S-band camer in\norder for the doppler rate aiding scheme to be workable.\nThe same reference frequency that drives the S-band exciter is used to generate the tiansmitter coder, making the\nratio between the carrier frequency and the transmitter\ncoder frequency a fixed ratio of 1/u)Q8.The clock that\ndrives the receiver coder is dcrived in a similar manner,\nexcept that the doppler adder adds the doppler frequency\noffset, proprrly scaled. A doppler signal to which a bias\nreference frequency has been added is used to avoid the\ncycle detection problems encountered near zero-frequency\ndoppler. The bias is removed digitally by the doppler\n\nadder. High-frequency logic is required to implemcnt the\ndoppler adder, since additions and subtractions must be\nperfornied at an intennediatck frequency (66 mHz) to\nminimize the phase jitter introduccd in the receivcr cndvr\nby the stepwise adjustment of its clock phase. The intermediate frequency is the highest frrqurncy compatihle\nwith the high-speed logic used.\nThe transmitter and receiver coders generate both continuous spectrum and discrete spectrum codes. The code\nt?;pe to be used for the acquisition is selt*ctahle at the\nbeginning of each ranging acquisition to enable each project to specify the code type best suited for its partioilar\nmission. The continuous spectrum code is a pseuJo-noise\ncode composed of six components which are combined\ninto a composite code that is transmitted continuously to\nthe spacecraft. The code power at any one frequency is\nsmall, minimizing the possibility of interference with\nother spacecraft operations; however, only a fraction of\nthe total code power is available to align each of the\nindividual components. The discrete spectrum d e is\ncomposed of 20 square waves whose frequencies range\nfrom approximately 5 liHz to approximately 1 Hz. Each\n0\nof the frequencies is sequentially transmitted to the spacecraft, so that the total code power is available to align it.\nThe discrete spectrum code can therefore be used at\nlowcr received signal levels than the continuous spectrum\ncode. The possibility of interference with other spacecraft\noperations has been reduced hg mixing all components of\nthis code with the highest frequency component.\n\nThe planetary ranging assembly was installed in the\nDSIF to provide range and DRVID data from spacecraft\ntraveling at planetary distances. The measurement of\nrange is used to improve the prediction of the spacecraft\'s\norbit, and the DRVID data disclose information concerning the charged particle content of space.\nRanging at planetary distances is possible because of\nthe performance improvement resulting from the incorporation of doppler rate aiding, code optimi;ration, and\nnumerical averaging of the received signal.\nThe PRA incorporates the flexihility necessary to support future missions by providing both continuous and\ndiscrete spectrum codes which may be used with either\nS-band or X-band carriers.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL RE=\n\n32-11126, VOL.

Xu(\n\nAdjustable Tuner for S-Band High-Power Waveguide\nJ. R. Loreman\nR. F. Systen s Development Section\n\nAs part of an effort to reduce the DSN trancmitter backyntiw ut DSS 14, an\nadjustable S-band icaueguide tuner for use crt 400 k has been dpueloped. The\nW\ntuner will be used to improoe the match of the transmitter waueguide to the\nantenna feed system at DSS 14 in an efort to reduce transmitter back power at\ncertain operating frequencies caused by high uoltage standing waue &io (VSWR)\nin the feed.\n\nbecause of various waveguide modifications to the\ntransmitter waveguide run at DSS 14 (Ref. l),the waveguide match of the run has changed, causing high transmitter back power. Measurements have been conducted\nin an effort tn determine the corrective measures required (Ref. 2). The measurements, as well as reports by\noperating personnel, indicated that the S-band polarization divvrsity (SPD) cone configuration in particular\nrequires an effort to reduce back power at certain operating frequencies. Zigures 1 and 2 show the voltage\nstanding wave ratio plot of the waveguide from the DSN\ntransmitter through the SPD cone in right circular polarization (RCP) and linear polarization, Calculated back\npower for each VSWR has been included on the charts.\nFurther measurements have been made at DSS 14 to\ndetermine the effect of a waveguide ttining section on\nthe VSWR. The tuning section used was a low-power\nbroad wall vane type tuner and, though not of a design\napplicable to high microwave power, its characteristics\napproximate deflection of the broad waveguide wall, a\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. xu(\n\ntechnique frequently used for tuning of high-power\nwaveguides. Figurc 3 shows the match a; low p c w r\nthrough the SPD cone in linear pdarization, with the\ntuner at the transmitter input to the waveguide. The\neffect on the VSWR with respect to frequency is apparent when this figure is compared with Fig. 2. From\nthe testing, it was apparent that a simple tuner based\non the controlled deflectior of the waveguide broad wall\nwould probably have sufficient tuning effect to rfduce\nthe VSWR of the SPD cone configuration to approximatsly 1.12 across the band of 2110 to 2120 MHz.The\nadvantages of such a tuner are simplicity; direct a. ;ilication to the high-power configuration, as the tuner could\nbe easily water-cooled; small size, as no auxiliary cavities\nwould be required; and simple mechanical design. The\nmain disadvantages are felt to be a limited frequency\neffect and limited retuning capability due to workhardening of the copper waveguide. Both of these disadvantages may be crucial to the acceptability of such\na simple design, as the changing of any one of the major\nreactive components in the waveguide run or cone will\n\nbars.

Figure 2 indicates the\ntheoretical coupling as a function of the hole diameter\nwith correction for the waveguide wall thickness (Kef.1).\nWhen the H-plane ann is tminated bv a short circuit,\nthe mismatch introduced into the main waveguide is a\nf\nfunction o the power coupling and the short position.\nFigwe 3 id\' i t a &e theoretical SuSCcPt;dnce variation\n(Ref. i\\ .i!culateci for aperture diameters of 3.81 and\n4.70 &m.

But the most obvious application, and\nthe only one considered here, is to RI\' power sources,\nalthough for our purposes the term "RF source" can be\nvery bnadly interpreted to include any dc (or 60- or\n400-Hz)\npowered source of electromagnetic powcr, P,,\nfrom very low frequency (VLF) to light.\nThe principal advantage of this device over conventional\n\nRF power messurement devices is that it enables "on-line"\nmehsurements, i.e., measurements of radiated power, with\naccuracy hitherto attainable only with dc substitution\n\ncalorimeters (Rtf. 1). It is. in fact, a kind of dc substitution nlorimeter in \\vhich the source itself serves as the\ndc load, but since it does not require an RF load (or an\nexternal dc load for dc substitution), it i s much cheaper\nthan a conventional R F calorimeter. For this reason one\nis tempted to call i a \'\'poor man\'s calorimeter," but we\nt\nwill stick with "no-load calorimeter" (NLC) for the purposes of this a-ticle.\nThe principal limitations on the applicabilit:.r of the\n(1) scurce efficiency must be relativel\\ high to\nobtain good accuracy.

Error Model\nFigure 2 is an approximate lumped equivalent circuit\nfor beat flow in a typical fluid cooled R F source. Most of\nPd,,,, viz PI flows from dissipation sites within the source\n(e.g., a tube anode) through an internal heat exchanger\n(e.g., coolant passages or fins in the anode) to the coolant.\nR , , represents the thermal resis%anceof the internal heat\nexchanger. The coolant then carries PI to an external\nheat exchanger that r e i c e it to an infinite heat sink a; T,\nthrough equivaltnt thermal resistance B I Z If the cooling\n.\nsystem is closed, R,Z is shunted by thermal capacitance\nC, which represents the finite heat capacity of the circulating coolant. Pp is the fluid frictional loss in the internal\nheat exchanger. Heat le;*kage fnn the source is represented by the shunt F.\n;e infinite heat sink at T,.\nFrom Eq. (1) and e1emc:tary\n\ncircuit theory we have\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nis an error term due to P, plus the heat flow between\nsinks at T, and T, through leakage conductance l/R2.\nIn general. T, and To, hence P,, are random variables\nof time.\n180\n\nWe assume that only P,, the heat carried from the\nto the external heat exchanger by the coolant, is\nsensed, so that the output voltaqe, c,,, of :he NLC is\n\nsource\n\nI;, at some time, sa)- t = 0, and at some positive value,\nPdp(0), Pdcr adjust the zero of the P, meter in the\nof\nwe\nmanner described above. we set\n\n11 = a (1 + a)/( + e,,)\n1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere E,, = P,(O)/P,,,(O), and Pr(0) is the value of P, at\nthat time. From Eqs. (2), (4). and ( 5 ) we find that at any\nfuture time, t ,\n\nwhere APr(t) = Pc(t) - P r ( O ) , and we have assumed eo\nsmall enough to write Q = d ( 1 + E,,). From Eq. (3) we\nsee that P r , hence APr(t), is independent of Pa,, hence of\nP,,\nd.,\nSO the two terms of AP, are uncorrelated, and the\nr m value of APn, ntls(APn), assumes its minimum value,\n~\n\nat J d,+.(t) = pdc(0).To minimize rms(AP,,), therefore, one\nbut\nmust not only be able to estimate the value of Pdisn\none must also rezero the Po meter \\\\irtx.everPzinrchanges.\nThe obvious way to get around this difficulty is to add a\nsignal proportional to P,(O) to the analog computation\nof Po as, for example, in the circuit shown in Fig. 3. The\nP,,\nmeter zero is first set with the P, compensation pot,\nRS, at P d r = 0. Then, with Pd, > 0, the Pn meter is again\nzeroed with R2 as previously described. This adjustment\neliminates the Pdr(0) - Pd,,, bias term from Eq. (6).\n\nTheoretically, the Fr compensation enables one to\nt\nrealize nnS(APn) = min [rms(APn)] = m [Ape( ) ] , i.e.,\nelimination of all errors except those due 10 random\nfluctuation of Ti - To. The cost is ;light: one addi..mal\nadjustment making three in all (51, a:rd h3),none of\nIZ2,\nwhich need be repeated when P d c or I\'dins change. On\nthe other haid, the benefit may ilso be slight if, for\nexample, rms [APe(t)] )> ave (Pe), or if instrumentation\nerrors swamp both.\nNote that leakage conductance l/R, enters into the\nerror term P, only through the relatively small gradient\nT i - To, not through the large gradient between the\nJP, TECHNICAL\n\nREPORT 3 2 - 1 a .

This is another\nadvantage the NLC has over a conventional dummy load\ncalorimeter: in the latter, heat leakage contributes\ndirectly to measurement error, and there is no easy or\ninexpensive way to compensate for it, whereas in the\nNLC, leakage coiiductance contributes a small, easily\ncompensatable error, and leakage power itself has no\ndirect effect.\nC, the thermal capacity of the circulating coolant, is\njust one of the many finite heat sinks in a large power\nsource and its cooling system, but it is included in the\nmodel because it tends to be much larger than most of\nthe 3thers. It can contribute a maximum error of\n( R , , / R , ) P , if h is adjusted before C is fully charged. In\nmost large fluid cooled sources, the coolant will be only\n5 to 10\xc2\xb0C warmer than T,,, while the internal heat source\nf\n(e.g., a tube anode) will be hundreds o "C hotter than\nthe m i a n t . This means that R,2 is much smaller than R,,.\nFurthermore, R,, -k R l z , the total thermal resistance of\nthe cooling system, is always much smaller than the leakage resistance R? in any reawnably designed large source.\nThertfore, R,?<<R, and the error caused by premature\nadjustment of b is very small. This rezoning may not hold\nfor small sources that have relatively large heat leakage,\nbut C is proportionally smaller for small sources and the\ntime required to reach thermal steady state is proportionally shorter.\n\n111. Experimental Results\nA breadboard NLC was b It and used to measure the\noutput of a 10-kW average power water cooled klystron\namplifier. The P d i r a signal was provided by resistance\ntemperature sensors that sensed the AT of the combined\ncoolant flows in collector and body. Coolant flow appeared\nto be constant to within the resolution (about 1%) of the\nflowmeter (hac! coolant flow not been constant, a flow rate\nsensor and (flow rate) X ATmultiplier would be required\nto provide the P,,,,, signal). The I\'dc signal was provided by\nanalog multiplication of the voltages appeuing at the\nterminals of beam current and beam voltage meters\ninstalled in the klystron power supply.\nThe P, meter waq adjusted to 2 kW full-scale using\n0\nportable standard meters to measure beam current and\nvoltage. No Calibration data were av.dable for the kilovoltmeter used to measure beam voltage but its accuracy\nwas assumed to be 1.0% on the basis of the manufacturer\'s claims. T i plus the 0.25% accuracy of the beam\nhs\ncurrent ammeter yields an estimated 1.255%accuracy for\nthe P d c calibration.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 3L -526, VOL YIX\n\nTwo kinds of tests WP. used to evaluate the performance of the NLC breadboard. The first was a comparison of simultaneous measurements of RF power by this\ndevice and by a conventional dummy load calorimeter.\nThe second was a test of "zero tr.-:king," i.e., the ability\n.of the NLC to retain its original ?ero reading 3s P,,, is\nvaried over its operational range while the actual RF\noutput remains fixed at zero. The zero-tracking test measures the total error due to nonlinearity and drift. It is,\nof course, incapable of determining what part of this total\nis due to instrumentation errors and what part\nin\nthe heat transfer processes of the source itself.\nThe results of the zero-tracking frst appear in Fig. 4.\nThe transient following each P+ step change is greatly\n5\nexaggerated by iiitcgration of the AT signal ( 7 = 2 s)\nrequired to suppress rapid fluctuations.\nerror is less\nFigure 4 shows that the steady-state P,,\nthan 0.20 kW (= 1.0% of full scale). The Po irieter was\ninitially zeroed at P,Ir = 20 kW. P, compensation was not\nattempted. Were P,(O) appreciable, we would expect to\nsee the error increasing linearly from 0 to 20 kW, but\nFig. 4 shows no clear evidence of such a trend. We conclude that the zero-tracking error is primarilv due to\ntemperature drifts (Ti - 2\'" fluctuations in the simplified\nerror model) within the source and/or instrumentation\ndrift and nonlinearities.\nThe bulk of the error may well be due to the offset\nvoltage at the input of the AT operational amplifier\n(op-amp). The AT op-amp was z e r c d at the beginning\nof the test, but the offset drifted from zero as the ambient\ntemperature changed. We can estimate the temperature\nchange required to produce the observed zero-tracking\nerror as follows.\nThe resistance temperature bridge output, u(AT), is\nabout 1.0 mV/"C. The coolant flow during the test was\n?fL lmin (19 gpm). Therefore, at Po = 0, the constant\nc(hT)/P,, = 0.2 mV/kW. Thus the observed 0.2-kW zerotracking error corresponds to an offset voltage of 0.04 mV.\nThe op-amp\'s offset temperature coefficient specification\nis 15 ;V/"C max, so that the 0.2-kW ezor Auld have\nbeen cniised by an ambient temperature 2hange of only\n2.7"C.Obviously, a Iow-drift op-amp foi AT would have\nbeen preferable, but this breadboard, like most, was built\nof the most avai!able, not the best, compouents.\nThe resiits oZ the no-load vs conventional calorimeter\nmeasurenients are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. Although\n181\n\nnothing was known about its thermal properties, the\ndummy load design appeared to provide excellent thermal\ninsulation between the coolant and the waveguide envelope of the load. The coolant was pure water. Coolant AT\nmas measured with a quartz thermometer, and load flow\nwas measured with a differential pressure flowmeter. The\nvalues recorded in Table 1 are the means of at least nine\nnearly simultaneous readings each of Po and dummy load\nAT at each pO\\ve. lcvel. The dummy load flow appeared\nto be constant throughout the run.\nThe apparent negative bias in the P,(NLC) - P,(CC)\nvalues in Table 1 may not be significant; all but one\ndifference is less than the maximum 0.20-kW error observed in the zero-tracking test, and the largest, 0.23 kW,\nis only slightly larger. In other words, the results of\n\nTable 1 are consistent with the hypothesis that the\nP,,(NLC)- P,(CC) discrepancies are entirely due to the\nprey: Jusly observed zero-tracking errors.\n\nIV. Conclusions\nThe no-load calorimeter enables on-line R F power\nmeasurement< at accuracies otherwise attainable only\nwith much more expensive off -line techniques and ccjuipment. A sin,ple alodel of heat flow in the R F source s h o w\nthat the inherenc accuracy of the no-load calorimeter measurement is limited essentially by random fluctuation in\ntemperature. gradients between heat sinks. Two brief\nbreadboard t s t s yielded consistrnt results. AT op-amp\noffset drift appears to be the major error contributor in\nbreadboard tests.\n\nReference\n1. Ginzton, E.

This work has been reported in detail by\nPetty and Jackson (Refs. 3 and 4).

Summary of DSS 14 Activity\nAs indicated at the close of the last major dual-carrier\nactivity report (Ref. 2), a return to DSS 14 was authorized\nat the beginning of 1973. The initial scope was set at\nthc accomplishment of whatever modifications could be\nmade during the then scheduled station down time in\nFebruary and hlarch. In addition to a work plan for this\nperiod, tests were designed and scheduled for \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\nand after\xe2\x80\x9d interf,Irence performance during January and\nApril-May. As of the end of May, the ten-fold improvement achieved (morc on this in the next section) was\nsufficient to uncover a level and type (spectral quality)\nof interference which pointed strong!!, to the highly illaminated ired coma with their newly installed S/X-band\nhardware. This latter equipment was added during the\naforementioned down time and consists of an ellipsoidal\nrcflector atop the S-Band Megawatt Transmit (SMT) cone\nand a dichroic plate over the Multiple-frequency X-and\nK-Band (MXK) cone (Ref. 14). It had been anticipated\nthat these items with their piece-part construction (rivets,\netc.) and hydraulic retraction mechanisms would prove to\n\xe2\x80\x98>etroublesome in the interference sense.\nBecause of the then approaching Mariner Venus/\nMercury 1973 (MVM\xe2\x80\x9973) preparations and Pioneer 10\nconfigiaration freeze, it was considered inadvisable to\nundertake any modifications to this critical equipment\nfor the purposes of interference abatement. However, in\norder to capitalize on the gains already achieved, a plan\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\nwas devised to remove intact the SNT and hlXK cones\nwith thc primary intent of evaluating the basic antenna\nwith only the relatively simple (externally speaking)\nPolarization Diversity S-Rand (PDS) cone in place. Evaluation in this configuration not only indicated further\nreduction in interference level but uncovered yet new\nclues pointing primarily to the quadripod apex and legs.\nHere again, a work plan was developed to complement\nan already scheduled survey and reconditioning of the\nmain reflector. In order to maintain test c.onfigurations as\norderly as possible, the re-installation of the cones was\ndelayed somewhat, with the hiXK going up sear the first\nof August and the Sl1T about one month later.\nMore test time during and after this effort would have\nallowed more satisfying cause-and-effect conclusiom to\nbe drawn, but thanks to the extraordinary efforts of\nDSK scheduling, station personnel, and key people from\nSections 332, 3 . and 731, additional improvements of\n33\n100-fold and more (30 dB since January) were obtained\nwith sufficient control to firmly establish the re-installed\ncones and related equipment as the limiting interference\nsources.\nTable 1 attempts to summarize these DSS 14 activities\nfor the purpose of establishing a time line for the discussion to follow, which will present the performance\nachieved at each step. The iniportant detail behind the\nmodification summary given above will be reported\nseparately\xe2\x80\x99 (see also Ref. 15).\n\nIV. Performance Results At DSS 14\nConsidering the completion times of Table 1 as the\nabscissa and the IMP mean averaged over the available\ntest periods as the ordinate, we obtain Fig. 1. As noted,\nall performance data are for the standard test conditions\nof dual 40-kW carriers at approximately 6-MHz spacing\n(N = 31)2.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cpre-1973\xe2\x80\x9d data point is typical of observations in\n1972 and prrhaps eariier. The 2- to 3-dR improvement\nindicated in the first intrrval is illustrative i ~ tlic- concept\nf\nthat for many discrete interference sourc\xe2\x80\x99 . eradication\nof less than a majority (assuming equal intensity for each)\nwill result i.1 less than 3-dB reduction in overall level.3\nKeeping Table 1 in mind, we see a 10-dB reduction\nI\n\n*Tobe published.\nis the index of the Nth spectral line above the upper camer\n(Ref. 2).\n3See first part of Ref. 15 for \xe2\x80\x9cpre-1973\xe2\x80\x9d modifications.\n2.\n\n187\n\n9\n\nachieved in the next interval, which represents the addition of the S/X feed cones, down time modifications, and\nreplacement of such internal waveguide items as switches\nand diplexer. While some data were taken in the SMT\ndiplex mode as well as with the PDS cone, which proved\nhelpful on a detailed diagnostic level, in general, the\ninterference performance was essentially the same with\neither cone active (Ref.16). For the purposes of this\narticle, it is sufficient to consider all data as taken in the\nPDS mode.\n\nAs of late May, the IMP mean had not only been\nreduced to typically -150 dBm (from -140 dBm in\nJanuary), it had also taken on a more stable character\n(Le., less variance). Similarly, the single- and dual-carrier\nnoise burst (NB) performance had made proportional\nimprovements (Fig. 2). As noted in the pxceding section,\nthe SMT and UXK feedcones were then removed, with\nan immediate 6 to 10-dB improvt-,ient. By late July,\nminor modifications primarily near the surface of the\nmain reflector, had yielded exceptionally interferencefree performance: IMP means of -170 dBm and kss\nand NB peaks in the 3-K range, except upon mechanical\nagitation of the quadripod apex/scbreflector assemblies.\nAs indicated in Fig. 1,t i effect had first been uncovered\nhs\nduring the prior test period, and wirs a primary consideration in the formulation of the Au,wt wmk plan (see\nTable 1).\nStation commitments forced the re-installation o the\nf\nMXK cone during the August modifications, with a result\nthat prechded the possibility of observing a probably\nstable interference level of -110 dBm or less. Nonetheless, evidence in mid-August stro-Tly indicates that the\nintermittence had been subdued, even though a new\nstable IMP level of - le0 dRm resulted in this configuration. By late August, with essentidy all modifications\ncomplete, the IMP level had apparently risen to\n- 155 dBm. As Table 1 indicates, the main reflector had\nbeen stripped of tape and retaped during this month, but\nwith lry weather in this period, it ic believed that tape\nwas not a fictor in the August p\xe2\x80\x99erformance data.\nTwc a p p m d y unrelated circumstances are of interest\nfor thic period. First, as noted in Table 1, the 400-kW\nklystron f L i l d at about the time the feed cones were\nremove4, and hecause spares had been temporarily consumed by nther high-power transmitter problems, it was\nnecessary LO adopt the 100-kW configuration as planned\nfor DSS 43 and 63. In order to maintain continuity of test\ncondition, dual 40-kW operation with the 100-kW klystron was attempted and just achieved with close monitoring of cperating conditions (i.e.> RF drive, beam\n\nvoltage, etc.). While this mode consi3erably exceeded\nthe 10% per carrier nominal operating power (Ref. 2),\nwith resulting increased level of low-order (uplink) intermodulation sidcbands in the transnritter output, special\ntests were conducted which indicated that tile receiue\nband IMPs were probably typically generated and, if\nanything, this configuration would yield data on the\nhs\nconservative side. T i transmitter configuration prevailed\nthroughout the balance of the year.\nsecondly, beginning at the mid-August tests and continuing thereafter, the prevailing IMP levels of -163,\n- 155, and finally -- 150 dBm in September became consistently more sensitive to carrier operating level. As seen\nin Fig. 3, a 3-dB reduction (to dual 20 kW) produced less\nreceive band IMPs in ratios approaching 30 dB ( - 150 to\n-180 dBm). All prior experience-early 1973 as well as\nboth DSS 13 and DSS 14 in 1972-suggested a cube law\neffect (approximately 9 dB per 3 dB) (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 2).\nThe clear implications here are that the July and August\neffort not only subdued the dual 40-kW intermittent but\nachieved a lasting reduction of the cube law mechanism\nby as much as 20 to 30 dB (referred to the 20-kW level),\nand that the implied interference sources associated with\ncone re-installation are of intrinsically different type from\nthose generally observed prior to that time. This conclusion reinforces earlier hypotheses concerned with loose\nas opposed to tight RF joints and the various intermediate\nsolid-state junctions.\nLargely unresolved a t this time are the weatherdependent characteristics of the IMPs and NBs. Prior\nexperience suggests that the August retaping of the main\nreflector (using latest techniques of insulation between\noverlapping tape junctiow) will improve performance in\nthis respect, but, as indicated by the termination of the\ntop m e of Fig. 2, there has been no opportunity to make\nt i evaluation.\nhs\n\nV. Conclusions\n1. Single- as well as dual-carrier noise bursts have been\ndiminished to insignificance to the benefit of all missions.\nThe only reservations concern the weather {as discwed\nabove) and the presently unknown maintenance requirements (discussed or implied in many earlier reports-Refs.\n3 and 17, in particular).\n2. With the D S 14 antenna and microwave equipment\nS\nin \xe2\x80\x9cas is\xe2\x80\x9d condition (September 1973), the dual-carrier\nperformance at 20 k is more than adequate to support\nW\nthe Viking application, as indicated in Fig. 4. Note that\nthe upper curve is taken from Fig. 3 and that the worstJPL \xe2\x80\x98TECHNICAL RtrORT 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\ncase Viking frequency separation offers additional margin\nover the nominal test conditions (Ref. 2). Reservations are\nas stated in (1) above.\n3. It is possibl, at least for a short period of time, to\n\nvirtually eliminate both internal and external interference\non a large antenna for worst-case excitation in the DSN\ncontext.\n4. It is n t considered possible to maintain the ultimate\no\nimplied by (3) under normal operations for any significant\nperiod of time. It is considered possible, and even feasible, to achieve -160 to -170 dBm IMP means and 3-K\nor less NB peaks for worst-case excitation, given redesign\nand/or elimination of some features of the present\n(DSS 14) S/X-band feed cones and a dedication to the\nrequisite operational care and maintenance.\n\nVI. Recommendations\n1. In order to maintain single-carrier improvements,\nrecommendations of maintenance and modification have\n\nbeen made (Refs. 3, 15, 17, 18) applicable in some degree\nto any antenna, and those at DSSs 43 and 63 in particular.\n2. Further, in support of single-carrier performance, a\nprogram of noise burst monitoring at DSS 14 at 400 kW\nas well as at other nominal operating levels is recommended, especially during the winter and spring months,\nto complement the summer data reported here.\n3. In the event dual-carrier operation is contemplated\nin support of, or for enhancement of, future flight projects, recommendations for more major modihcations for\nthe 64-m network are also included in Refs. 15 and 18.\nThese relate primarily to the external antenna and have,\nin the course of this program, been largely accomplished\nat DSS 14.\n4. Fhally, a firm commitment to dual-carrier operation\nshould, in addition to the above, be supported by a\nthorough evaluation of and response to the S/X-band feed\ncone and maintenance implications of conclusion (4)\nabove.\n\nReferences\n1.

Billings\nNetwork Operations Office\n\nThe Computer Program Copy-Verify and Lwrl Check System cmsists of two\nprograms, D01-5352-SP and DOZ5379-SP. The system asslues the integrity of a\nDSN program tape at two critical points-reproduction and hading. The Mag Tape\nCopy Routine DO15352-SP verifies the tape os it is being copied. The Mag Tape\nLoad Check Loader Program interacts with parts of the Mag Tape Copy Routine\nto check the ualfdity of a h d in progress.\n\n1. Introduction\nSome DSN computer programs have presented a problem to the DSN Program Library because thert! is no\ndirect way of reproducing their tapes. These programs are\nthose which occupy almost all of the 16K memory locations in the XDS 920 computers; they are too large to be\ncopied by a standard mag tape copy routine. This constraint also precludes the verification of a copied tape. The\nloading of these programs has also posed a problem because most of them are mission-criticalreal-time programs\nin which an unrevealed loading error could cause data loss\nor command malfunction. Procedures were needed to\nensure that such tapes were copied accurately and loaded\ncorrectly.\nThe usual procedure for making mag tape copies w a s to\nincorporate a self-dump routine in the program itself; this\nroutine dumped all of core memory as a single r w r d on\ntape. The program was loaded intc memory, and then a\nJPL TECHNICAL RvQllT 32.1826, VOL. XIX\n\nbranch was made to the self-dump routine. The routine\nallowed the program to be dumped as many as nine times,\nbut there was no way of checking that the dump was correct or even whether tke program was loaded accurately\nin the first place.\nA reload routine was also incorporated in the program\nso that another record codd be loaded in the event of a\nbad load or subsequent failure. The capability of reloading\nthe program from the extra records on tape provided some\ninsurance against bad recordings and stretching or other\nphysical damage. However, this insurance did not prevent\nloss of data from program hangups and other failures,\nmany .7f which were blamed on \xe2\x80\x9cbad loads\xe2\x80\x9d for want of a\ndefinite cause, although they could have ster-imed from\ncopj 0~fox-s loading errors.\nor\n\nFrom the point of view of the DSN Program Library,\nthe procedure is unsatisfactory. The Program Library is\n193\n\ncharged with the responsibility for the accurate duplication of mag tapes, and this procedure does not ensure\naccuracy. The self-dump technique provides a means of\nmaking copies of R tape, but, except for parity checkhg\nin the computer and tape units, it does not verify that the\ncopies are 100%\naccurate. To ensure accurate duplication,\nIOOS verification is considered necessary.\nThe self-dump routine .vas therefore rewritten to include a verification sequenc: the new program is titled\nMag Tape Copy Routine DOI.5352-SP and has been distributed to personnel engaged in programming for the\nDeep Space Network XDS 9.20 computers. The program\noccupies 400, locatioiis in memory starting at location\n38oo0,. The program dumps core into mag tape as many\ntimes as requested, rewinds, and then performs a word-byword comparison between core and the records on tape.\nTypewriter messages indicate successful verification or\ncomparison errors; in the latter case, the whole procedure\nis restarted.\nMag Tape Copy Routine DOI-5352-SP also includes a\nload-check routine, which is used in conjunction with Mag\nTape Load-Check Loader DOI-5379-SP to ensure a correct load. Following the load from mag tape, the program\nbranches to the load-check routine, reads another record\nfrom tape, and compares it word by word with the record\nalready loaded in core. Typewriter messages indicate\nwhether or not the comparison (and, hence, the load) is\nsuccessful. Together, these two programs comprise a system which ensures against copy errors and \'"bad loads."\n\nII. Program Description\nM a Tape Copy Routine DOI-5352-SP, written in XDS\nM\ng\n9.20 symbol language, is essentially in two parts: a dump\nsequencl\nwhich a requested number of records is written on tape, and a verify sequence, in which the tape is\ncompared word by word with core memory. The routine\nchecks for buffer errors in the dump sequence and for\ncomparison errors in the verify sequence. If a buffer error\noccurs, the tape erases backwards over the entire record,\nand then erases forward over half the record to get the\ntape quickly by any bad areas. Comparison errors are indicated by an error message; the tape rewinds to load point\nfor another start.\nNo comparison is made of the area in which the copy\nroutine is located (36OOO,-36377,).Since values are chang-\n\n194\n\ning in these locations during the comparison sequence, the\nwhole area is bypassed. Copy errors in this section would\nbe inconsequential because tapes are ordinarily copied\nfrom a single master and not from other copies.\nA feature of this program is that either buffer may be\nconnated to the tape units; the program automatically\ndetermines which buffer is connected and sets up all the\nmag tape instructions accordingly. The buffer test is performed using the end-of-tape test as a pseudo-instructicn.\nIf the tape is not at the end of the reel, a \\V-buffer end-oftape test will cause the next instruction to be executed\nprovided the tape unit is cmnected to the Y-buffer, or it\nwill cause the next instruction to be skipped if the tape\nunit is connected to the \\+\'-buffer.\n\nThe load-check routine is incorporated in this program\nand shares subroutines with the dump and verify sequences as needed. Mag Tape Load-Check Loader DOI5379-SP branches to this routine after loading a program\nfrom mag tape. The load-check routine reads the next\nrecord from tape and compares it word by word with core\nmemory. If the cornparison is successful, a LOADCHECK\nOK message is typed out; if a comparison error is found,\nthe operator is alerted with an error message and the\nprogram branches back to the loader to begin the operation again.\nSome features of Mag Tape Load-Check Loader DOI5379-SP are that it will operate with either buffer, it\nzeroes core memory before loadirlg a program from mag\ntape, it rejects any record on tape that is shorter than\nnormal and reads instead the next record. and it branches\nto location 1 (where it expects to find a branch to the beginning of the program) after loading and verifying that\nthe proper load was achieved.\n\nIll. Conclusion\nThe success obtained with this copv-verify and loadcheck system indicates that it is a feasible and practical\nway of verifying tape duplication and loading. Its use by\nprogrammers is encouraged to provide the DSN Program\nLibrary with a convenient means of verifying that tapes\nare copied accurately and to provide Deep Space Stations\nwith assurance f hat programs are loaded correctly. The\nnext step is to Izxpand the system to include those tapes\nwhich are reco1.ded with subprograms following the main\nrecords and those which are recorded in modular form.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL RE-1\n\n32-1526, VOL.

Lobdell\nNetwork Operations Officc\n\nThiP article presents a description of Network Telemehy System Performance\nTmts that were enecuted throughout the DSE\' in support of the MVM\'73 project.\n\n1. Introduction\nSystem Performance Tests (SPTs)are executed throughout the DSN whenever a modification is made to the Neths\nwork Telemetry System that affects its performance. T i\nis the case when new software or hardware is added, as\nwas required for the support of Marint! 10. The purpose\noi this article is to describe the effort that was undertaken\nin executing telemetry SPTs throughout the DSN and to\npresent the test results. The philosophy and the objectives\nof the SPTs will be discussed so as to demonstrate the\nbenefits gained by performing these tests. A description\nof the telemetry SPTs will be presented, along with a\ndescription of the test procedure and test software. A\nsummary of the results and the status of the Netwoik\nTelemetry System will be presented.\n\nII. Objectives of System Performance Testing\nThe development of test procedures, test softw Ire, and\nthe execution of the telemetry SPTs are performed to\naccomplish certain objectives. The overd objective is to\n1%\n\nguarantee that the Network Telemetry System can meet\nspecifid operational capabilities. These apabilities are\ndefined in various documexits; those of particular importance are given in Refs. 1 through 3. The SPT must verify\nthat the telemetry system configurations and interface\nrequirements are satisfied. They must also evaluate the\nability of the Telemetry System to meet performance\nrequirements.\n\nThe telemetry SPT is designed so that it can be used\nto locate or diagnose system problems. The problems may\noccul during the installation of new equipment or software, or they may be the results of system failures uncovered during DSN real \'ime tracking operations. Some\nof the latter type problems have been discovered when\nportions of the SPT are used during countdown tests.\nUse of SPTs for prepass readiness tests is another objective that requires thkt the SPT procedure be modular.\nThus, the various classes and levels of prepass readiness\ntests can be accomplished by executing the appropriate\nsections of the procedure.\nJPL TECHNML MCORT 32-1526, w)L x1?:\n\nThe modularity feature of the procedure enhances the\ncapability to test modifhations that may deet the capabilities of the Telemetry System. Portions of the test\nprocedures are used to perform onsite (DSN Facility)\nacceptance testing of both hardware and software.\nAn additional objective of SPTs is to aid in the training\nof station personnel. The SPTs are prepared so that the\nconfigurations used are as near as possible to configurations used for real time tracking of the spacecraft. By\nusing the test procedures, s. tion personnel can gain\nexperience in operating the Telemetry System and Telemetry and Command Data (TCD) software. This experience\nis particularly valuable when new equipment, configurations, or software have been introduced.\n\n111. Test Configuration\nShown in Fig. 1 is the general telemetry test configuration. Simulated data are generated in the Simulation\nConversion Assembly (SCA). The simulated data called\nfor in the tests are a 2047-bit psuedo-noise (PN) sequence;\nyet fixed pattern data, such as square wave data, may be\nused if special tests require that the data be recognized\nand validated by visual inspection. The SCA generates\neither a single channel or two channels of data, depending on the telemetry mode being tested. In the case of the\nsingle channel of data, the SCA modulates these data with\na square wave subcarrier. For the two channels, the data\nchannels are modulated with two subcarriers using the\ninterplex scheme. The modulation indices of the subcarriers are set by using the wave analyzer at the receiver.\nThe data on the subcarriers phase modulate a carrier generated in the test transmitter, which is interfaced to the\n1\nDSN Block 1 1 receiver through ambient load and the\n20-dB coupler. The test transmitter signal level is adjusted\ntr, obtain the required signal-to-noiseratio which is accurately measured at the Y-factor detector.\nThe Telemetry and Command Data handling software\n(DSN Program Library Software No. DOI-!XWOP) resides in the Telemetry an1.i Zommand Processor (TCP)\nand in the Data Decoder As;. .?My (DDA), both of which\nare small genera! purpose co*?*!uters. The TCD software\ncan be configured to process data using any one of three\ntelemetry channels. For Mariner 10 support the channels\nare as follows:\n\n(1) Channel 1 (CH1). Low-rate uncoded (LR UNC)\nwith data rates of 8% and 33% bits/s. This channel\ninterfaces the Subrarrier Demodulator Assembly\n(SDA)directly to the software internal bit sync loop\nJPL TECHNSAL MPO#T 32-1526, VOL XIX\n\nresiding in the TCP. The \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x98Ci formats these data,\nrecords them as a digital Original Data Record\n(ODR), and transmits them via high-speed data\n(HSD).\nChannel 2 (CH2). Medium-rate coded (MR C) at\n490 and 2450 bits/s; LR UNC at 8% and 33%bi;s/s.\nThe data from the SDA are synchronized and detected by the Symbol Synchronizer Assembly (SSA).\nThe medium rate coded data are block-decoded\nusing DDA software. These data are formatted and\ntransmitted to the TCP where they are recorded as\nan ODR and transmitted via HSD. Low-rate data\nare accepted by the DDA from the SSA. These data\nare formatted and transmitted to the TCP where\nthey are handled the same as Channel !\xe2\x80\x99 data.\nChannel 3 (CH3). High-rate coded (HR C) at 22.05\nand 73SO kilobits/s; medium rate coded at 490 and\n2450 bits/s; high-rate uncoded (HR UNC) at 117.6\nkilobits/s. The high rate coded and medium rate\ncoded data are decoded by the Block Decoder Assembly (BDA). The DDA accepts the high- or\nmedium-rate decoded data from the BDA or highrate irncoded data from the SSA. These data are\nfw:c..~tted a d transmitted via wide band drta\n(WBD) lines \xe2\x80\x98f they are high-ratecoded or via HSD\nlines if they are medium-rate coded. The formatted\ndata are also recorded on the DDA 9-track highdensity recorder (HDR), creating an ODR.\nThe transmitted data block. (the output of the TCD)\nare described in detail in Ref. 4. The specificationsplaced\non the telemetry system by these requirements are very\nimportant and must be tested.\nThe TCP has a 24bit direct transfer interface with the\nDigital Instrumentation System (DIS). The operational\ntelemetry software uses this interfece to transfer initialization, status and calculation messages to the monitor system (Ref. 5). This interface is tested, but without the DIS\nmonitor operational software.\nThe DIS k used to process the data for the test using\nthe Telemetry and Command System Test Program (DOL\n5409-SP).The data transmitted by the TCP or DDA go to\nthe station communication center and are normally transmitted to the Mission Control and Computing Center\n(MCCC). To use the DIS as the prmessing computer, the\nDDA or TCP HSD/WBD lines must be petched at the\nstation communication center to the DIS HSD/WBD\nlines.\n197\n\nIV. Telemetry System Test Software\n\n(3) Binary time and multisecond clock differences.\n\nThe Telemetry and Command System Test Program,\nDOI-5409-SP, resides in the DIS computer. It contains\ntwo subprograms: a telemetry subprogram and a command subprogram, both under the control of an Executive\nProgram. The progrcm interfaces with the TCD string to\nbe tested through the HSD/WBD on-site GCF equipment\n(station communications center), and the 24-bit monitor\ninterface. By virtue of these interfaces, the TCD and its\noperational roftware are tested in an operational environment. That is, the telemetry system test validatv data as\nthey are transmitted externally from the TCD system.\n\n(4) GCF errors.\n\nThe software receives the monitor data, and formats\nand prints the results selectively on thc DIS 1/0 typewriter or line printer. Due to the greater print speed of\nthe line printer, it is normally used dcring the tests. The\nmonitor data displayed are initialization messages, status\nmessages, and the calculation messages. These messages\nare validated by visual inspection for correctness and completeness in compliance with Ref. 5.\nThe telemetry data HSD\xe2\x80\x99WBD blocks may be displayed on the line printer for visual inspection, although\nnormal operation consists of permitting the software to\noutput the following:\n(1) Standard block header information consisting of\nsource, destination, data-dependent type (DDT),\nuser-dependent type (UDT), spacecraft identifica-\n\ntion, and day of the year and the time of the block\nformation.\n(2) Formatted configuration and lock status with receiver AGC or signal level in dBm, and the TCE\nsoftware channel in use.\n(3) The bit error rate (BER) or word error rate (WER)\nmeasured over a given period; the bit rate and data\nformat.\n\nIn the bit error rate test, the data may be either PN or\na fixed pattern. The test software synchronizes to the data\nand dops a bit-by-bit comparison. The WER/BER accumulation may be over any chosen interval resulting in a\ngrand total, while statistics can be displayed as interim\nsummaries at intervals as required.\nthe test is being executed, the test software\ndetect errms and display error messages as follows:\n(1)\n\nme A\xe2\x80\x99\n\nbetween telemew HSD\xe2\x80\x99WBD blocks are\nnot within specifled tolerances.\n\n(2) Excessive bit error or incorrect data type, as midenced by the inability to achieve synchronizatior:.\n198\n\nThe telemetry system soitware is an invaluable tool,\nwhich has done much to facilitate and ease the execution\nof the Telemetry System Performance Tests.\n\nV. Test Procedure Format\nThe P.etwork Telemetry System Performance Tests for\nMariner 10 were executed using Ref. 6. In this section, the\nformat of the procedure will be presentcd to provide a\ndescription of the tests that are performed at the Deep\nSpace Stations.\nThe overall test is divided into threc main tests. Each\nmodular so\ntest contains a number of su5,ests th,\nthat any test can be run independr\n.is allows the\nprocedures to be used for prepass\ntests, troubleshooting, and new equipment or softu .Ire tests. It also\nallows for reduced testing when resources so demand.\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\nThe three ..sts are the Configuration and Interface\nTests, the Telemetry Performance Tests and the Non-Real\nTime Capability Tests. These tests all call out a Test Preparation Section as needed. The complete test, two TCD\nstrings, can be accomplished in 40 hours.\n\nA. Configuration and Interface Tests\nThe Configuration and Interface Tests are performed\non the three telemetry channels (CH1, CH2, and CH3).\nThey test the telemetry operational software and hardware interfaces using all the operational configurations\nplanned for Mariner 10 support. This test contains HSD.\nand WBD interface tests that verify the HSJ>/WRL\nblocks. The blocks are verified by inspection of the formatted block headers, configuration and lock indicators\nthat are formatted for ease of interpretation, and by the\nabsence of error messages. This section contains a set of\nTCP-DIS mrmitor message verification tests that verify\nthat the initialization, status, and calculation messages are\ncorrect as specified.\nAlthough the AGC,/dBm conversion test and the signalto-noise ratio (SNR) calculation test dre separate sections\nof the test procedure, they are normally run with the\nconfigurat\xe2\x80\x99.on and interface tests. The AGC/dBm cor. ::rsion test verifies that software can perform a correc! conversion from AGC volts to signal level in dBm. The\nconversion parameters are entered in the program, and\naccuracy of the conversion is checked io see t it it is\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nwithin 20.05 dBm. The SNR calculation test verifier the\naccuracy of the software SNR estimator routine. SI 3 of\n15, 10, and 5 dB are set up using the Y-Factor machine.\nThe calculation is verified to bc accurate within kO.3 dB.\n\n(This is also normal operational procedure for supporting\nthe 117.6 kilobits/s mode.) Performance data can then be\nobtained as they were for the other data modes.\nC Non-Real Time Capability Tests\n\nThe important aspect of the configuration and interface\ntrsts is that they insure that the functional capabilities of\nthe Telemetry System exist. (The configurations tested\ncan be found in Fig. 3.)\nB. \';elemetry Performance Test\n\nThe Telemetry Performance Tests determine the capability of thr Tclcmetry System to meet the DSN support\nperformance wquirements. These tests are designed to\nevaluate telemetry performance at threshold SNRs with\nCH1, CH2,and CH3 configured in the Mariner support\nmodes.\n\nThr test measurcs the output data Word Error Rate\n(WER) for coded data and the Bit Lrror Rate (BER) for\nuncoded data given an input data signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe results are compared against predicted BER IVER,\nand if they arc within given tolerances, the pcrformance\nis considered to Iw acceptable. The predictions are based\non :I \'able m;ithrmatical models of the Telemetry System (kicfs. 7 through 10). These models are evaluated\nusiiig a compiitcr program. This program is called the\nTc4cxmr.try Efficiency Program, and is ised primarily to\ngtwrate performance parameters for thv telemetry SPTs.\nA strong signal test is always executed mior to a weak\nGgrd test. The strong signal test is nin to detect gross\ncrrors in tlw HSD WBD blocks that would invalidate the\nweak signal tests, which take much longer to perform.\nThe strong signal test a h confirms thc set up configuration a i d interfaces.\n\nThe weak signal performance tests arc run for all operational configurations and data rates. An accurate SNR is\nsct using tlic Y-Factor machine, and the WEF/BER is\nmrasurrd and rrcordcd. Thr. SNR calculation is also\nchecked for accllrdcy. (The te!emetry modes and performance tolerances can be obtained from Fig. 5 )\n\nDuring the execution of the telenietry perfonnance\ntests, Original Data Records (ODRs) are created to be\nplayed back and validated in the Non-Real Time Capability Tests, with the exception of the ODR for the 117.6\nkilobits s uncoded data mode. Since the WBD lines are\nlimited to a data rate of 28 kilobits/s, it is not possible to\nperform a telemetry performance test in real time, Therefore, the data are recorded, then played back at the wideband rate, with an effective data rate of 22 kilobits/s.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 324526. VOL. XIX\n\nThe ODRs generated in the performance tests are validated in the thud set c;f SPTs. These are the Non-Real\nTime C,ipability Tests. In the first part of these tests, the\nODR plavback demonstration, the digital OD& are\nplayed back using the appropriate playback program, the\n7-track playback program (DOI-mi-OP) or the 9-track\nplayback p ~ c g a m(P9 module of DOI-5050-OP). This\ndemonstrates the ability to play back taYe5, using both the\nTCD and the playback software. The HSD/WBD blocks\nare checked in a manner similar to the configurntian and\ninterface tests, to insure that the tapes were pruperly\nrecorded.\nIn the second part of the Non-Heal Time Capeability\nTests, analog tape playback demonstratior analog tapcs\nare generated at a specific SNR and then played back.\nThe tape oatput SNR is obtained and compxed against\nthe set SNR. The tape output SNR must be no greater\nthan 1 dR. ICW than the set SPIR.\nData reporting is accomplishzd by using fou- data\nsheets. These are presented in Figs. 2 through 5 T w (:ala\nsheets are:\n(1) Data Shret 1: Test Report Log. This i a t I sheer is\nused to keep a record on what tests have been performed throughout the Network (Fig. 2).\n(2) Data S\'ieet 2 : Configuration/\'Interface Tests.

MVM973 NetworkTelemetry\nTest Status and Results\nExecution of network telemetry SPTs for MVM\'73 was\nscheduled to begin in May of this year, with a completion\ndate of 10 August 1973. Unfortunately, these dates here\nnot met due to the late delivery of operational sofware\n199\n\nand hardware. The tests were s t i l l being executed after\nthe Mariner 10 launch; however, all of the Configuration\net\nand Interface Tss plus those capabilities that were required for launch had been completed prior to launch.\nThe tests were required t be perfonned at the following\no\nstations:\nGoldstone, California: CSS 12 and DSS 14.\nTidbinbilla, Australia: DSS 42 and DSS 43; conjoint stations.\nMadrid and Ceberos, Spain: D S 62 and DSS 63.\nS\nThe tests were conducted by station personnel. In a\nnumber of cases the SPTs uncovered station problems,\nwhich, when corrected by the station personnel, required\na rerun of system tests. The station personnel also made\nrecommendations on modifications or corrections of the\nprocedures.\nData taken during the tests were transmitted to the\ntelemetry SCOE. The data were analyzed and saved. To\nevaluate the status of the Telemetry System, a Telemetry\nTest Status Board was created. The most recent data from\neach station are recorded on this Board, and are presented\nin Fig. 6.\nThe Telemetry Test Status Board presents the date that\nthe Cmfiguration and Interface Tests, including AGC/\ndBm and SNR tests, were completed. It also presents the\nresults of the performance tests (1-1 through 7) and the\ndate that these tests were Completed. For the performance\ntests, the data rate, input SNR,allowable WER/SER, and\nallowable SNR with tolerances are presented. The Board\nshows whi-h tests are not completed and due, are out of\nrm\ntolerance, and are not required f o a particular station.\n\nA l of the Configuration and Interface Tests (including\nl\nthe AGC/dBm and SNR tests) were successfully completed prior to Mariner 1 launch. The Telemetry Per0\nformance T s s were not completed. Some of the tests\net\nwere r n but the results were not within tolerance. These\nu,\nresults wwe accepted since they were nearly within specification, and it was deemed that the station resources not\nbe loaded by further testing except on a best e h r t s basis.\nIn some cases, rhta from the tests were not available.\nThese tests were not completed due to hardware problems that were uncovered prior to or during the tests.\nSince the tests were run late, many problems were discovered just prior to Mariner 10 launch. The problems\nr\ncould n : he corrected due to the Mariner configuration\nfreeze,and then the X . r e e r 10 con6guration. The problems are now being correct& a 3 the tests will be run\nafter the termination of the Piorter configuration freeze.\nThe Non-Real Time Tests were executed prior to\nMariner launch with the following results:\n(1)All TCP ODRs were validated.\n(2) DDA OD& at DSSs 14 and 63have been validated.\n\n(3) Hardware problems with the DSS 43 DD! OD%\nhave been uncovered.\n(4)\n\nAll %meter-antenna DSS analog tape ODRs have\nbeen validated.\n\n(5) h h l e m s with the recorder track assignments of the\n&%meter-antenna DSS Analog Tape ODRs have\nbeen uncovered.\nOverall, the performance as demonstrated by the Telemetry SPTs, has been acceptable.\n\nReferences\n1.

Bahadur and P.Gottlieb\nSystems Analysis Section\n\nThis article presents a method for analyzing the efects of training and stGng\npolicies, and for sekcting optimum policies which minimize the expenditures for\ntraining and salaries while maximizing the performance of the tracking station. Two\nmodels haoe been deoeloped which represent increasing levels of sophistication.\nThe first characterizes steady-date behavior under the optimizat& o f training,\naverage capability, and crew size. The second, which is the dynamic model, optimizes the operating policy over a sequence of time segments. Each segmt..,\' is\ncharacterized by a performance requirement (dependent on the phase o f the mission), turnover, and training allocation with a corresponding change in average\nccrpability. With inputs such as required minimum station performance, training\navailability,current crew capability,and expected turnover,the output of the model\nwill be the change in average crew capability, the percentage of time allocated for\ntraining,and thd corresponding minimum cash expenditure for sakzries and training.\n\nI, Introduction\nThis article presents a methodology for analyzing the\nstaffing and training requirements for operating a DSN\ntracking station. This analysis is part of a study made to\ndevelop tools to assist the management of the Deep Space\nNetwork in the planning and operation of the tracking\nstations.\nIn order to meet tracking commitments, the management of the t sacking stations allocates personnel and\nfinancial resources among operations, maintenance, and\ntraining. Training is not only for new personnel and operators of new equipment, but also for upgrading the skills\nof veteran personnel. This article discusses the methods\n\ndeveloped to assess the changing demands in these areas\nand to formulate an operating and training policy to satisfy requirements in a cost-effectivemanner.\nWork is continuing, especially in the area of training\neffectiveness,to represent more characteristicsof the staffing and training policy with our model, and to generate\noptimal training and staffing policies of practical value,\nusing DSS 12 as the main example. The specific acwmplishments expected :rr the near future from these efforts\nare listed in Section IX.\nWe begin with a discussion of the general features of\nthe tracking station represented by our model.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL R E M 32-1526, VOL. XIX\n\n207\n\n. PRECEDING PAGE B W K NOT\n\nF\n\n11. Characteristics of the Model\nOptimizztion of performance. The performance of\nthe tracking station in carrying out the different\ntasks may be measured by certain selected parameters. These parameters are treated as an output of\nthe system, e.g., system availability, data recovery,\nnumber of data outages, etc. A maximization (or\nminimization) of one or more parameters provides\nthe basis for the optimal operating policy.\nRelationship between performance (output) and\ncapability (skills available). There exists a relationship between the capability of the men and the\nquality of the station performance, which in turn is\nexplicitly related to the parameter being optimized.\nThese relationships between capability and performance are dtimately expressed in quantitative\nterms.\nTraining to increase capability. Training methods,\nwhich may be of varying effectiveness, are available\nto increase the capability of the men to perform\ntheir tasks. This may be either through increased\nproficiency in familiar subsystems or the development of proficiency in different or new subsystems.\nConstraints. There are constraints on the system,\nwhich are parameterized and which may vary with\ntime. Typical constraints are the type of training\nmethods available, the amount of time and manpower available for training, minimum performance\nrequirements, and the number of crews required.\n\nHiring is done to either add to, or replace, the people\n- working at the station. The \xe2\x80\x9cworld\xe2\x80\x9d represents the awilable manpower pool, and includes former vmployees.\nThe tracking station (the operating system) transforms\nthe inputs into a tangible, measurable quantity. This is the\noutput or performance of the system.\nTwo methods of training are considered, formal training a d m-the-job training. The employees at the tracking\nstation have the same general background, since they satisfy certain basic selection and hiring criteria. Thus, it is\nassumed in this model that the different training methods\nare mually effective for all employees. Further work is\nnec\xe2\x80\x98 dry to delineate the difference in the effectiveness\nof training by method, background of the individual, and\nthe length of his employment at the tracking station.\n\nIV. The Internal Environment of the\nTracking Station\nThe people at the station may be divided into two\ncategories:\n(1) Administrative personnel. This category includes\nthe station managers, secretaries, schedulers, etc.,\nwho perform the administrative tasks at the station.\n( 2 ) Maintenance and operations personnel. These include the operators and technicians who maintain\nand operate the station equipment.\n\nCosts associated with maintaining and improoing\nperformance. These costs include operating expenses such as salaries, and some forms of capital\ninvestment such as training of new technicians.\n\nHenceforth, for convenience, any reference to an individual at the station will imply an individual from category (2).\n\nThese five features provide the basic structure and interrelationships for constructing the model. Within this basic\nframework, the model attempts to determine the \xe2\x80\x9coperating policy\xe2\x80\x9d which optimizes a given parameter while the\ntracking station is under a speified set of constraints.\n\nStation personnel, both new employees and veteran\npersonnel, receive training to increase their operations\nand maintenance skills in various subsystems. As mentioned previously, two methods of training are considered:\nformal training and on-the-job training.\n\n111. The External Environment of the\nTracking Station\nThe block diagram shown in Fig. 1 illustrates the relationships between the tracking station and its environment. The rectangular area within the dashed line\nrepresents the tracking station. The area outside the rectangle is the external environment of the trackiag station.\nThe significant relationships between the tracking station\nand areas in its external environment are identified.\n\n2oa\n\nFormal training, as the name suggests, consists of\nclassroom-typemultimedia instruction. A group of trainees\nis taught a specific skill by a qualified instructor. Under\nthe present Deep Space Network configuration, the Training Center develops, with the assistance of the Technical\nS t d , h e instruction material and provides the instructors.\nDuring the time that a trainee is undergoing formal training, he cannot participate in station operations. Thus, the\ntrainee performs no \xe2\x80\x9cuseful work\xe2\x80\x9d during formal training,\nand a11 of his time is devoted io tiaixiing.\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nOn-the-jul-, training takes placc. within the station. A\ntrainee working with an already trained man acquires the\niiccessary skills through observation and practice. Experience suggests that half the combined time of trainee and\ntrainer rrsiilts in uscful \\vork. The ot1it.r half is devoted to\nlearning, and consrquently the prorrss of on-the-jobtraining is not a s efficient timewisc ;is formal training.\n\nTo express this distinction. \\ve define the c,ff ectiveness\nof a training method to be the ratio of the time required\nto acquirca the skill with thr give11 method compared to a\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x98Ftandard training mcdiod. For convenience, \\\\\xe2\x80\x99e take the\nmore efficient formal training to be the standard. E v e rienre suggrsts that trainers\xe2\x80\x99 time spent in on-the-job\ntrainin5 is only 40% rffective RS formal training (Ref. 1).\nas\nThe operations and maintenance skills in different subsystems acquircd by an individual througli the process of\ntraining may he transli\xe2\x80\x98ted into a measure called the\n\xe2\x80\x9ccapability\xe2\x80\x9d of tho individual. The division of the tracking\nstation into subsystems may be along hardware lines or\nalong fiinctional 1inc.s as is prrsently the case, with the\nnumber of subsystcms ranging from 14 to 36. Henceforth,\nthe usc of the word capability will hr restricted to the\nabove definition.\n\nThe capability of an individual is measured in terms of\nthe number of subsystems that lie can operate andjor\nmaintain. This measure is \\wightcd by the relative d f i culty factor of each siibsystrm, in the followiag manner\n(Ref. 2),.The number of days of formal training required\nto train a man to opcr,tte and maintain a subsystem is\ndeterminrd. The rapability of an individiial is then determined by the subsystems that he can operate and maintain in terms of fo:mal training days. If an individual has\npartial proficirncy in a subsystem, the corresponding percentage of the total for that siihsystem is added to his\nrapability .\nRrtween August 1971 and June 1972, DSS 12 was\ndividcd into 14 hardware suhsystems. The average training time in a siihsystrm for operations and maintenance\nwas 22 days (u = 15.6)and 70 days (u = 42), respectively.\nDuring this tirnr period, thr average individual capability\nvaried between 191 and 241 days. Let\n\nK; = capability of the ith individual (formal training\n\nthen\n\nFar every \xe2\x80\x9cpass\xe2\x80\x9d (tlir. continuous tracking period of a\ngiven sp,.cecraft), the total amount of data available for\ncollectioo can bc determined irom thc spacecraft tracking\nand testinp schedule. This total represents the maximum\noutput of the system.\nWe define the data acquisition efficiency 71 = (actual\ndata gathered availablt. data) for an averagr view prriod.\nThe two factors which have the grratest influence on data\nacquisition efficiency (Ref. 3) arr\n\n(1) Capability of the statim personnel\n\n(2) Man hours spent in actual operations and maintenance (a<opposed to training)\nThe men at the station are divided into sevrral crews\n(1 to 4). dependiiig on the number of shifts that the station\noperates. If the nirn are divided among the crews so that\nthe total capability of the men in each crew, called crew\ncapability, is the same for all crcws, then\n7 = f (crew capability, percentage of time spent in\noperations)\n\nwhere\n\nhK\n\xe2\x80\x99\ncrew capability = -\n\nnf\n\nM\nand\n\ni ~ n i a\nLet\n\nt , = fractional time spent in operations by the average\nindividiial\nt, = fractional timc spent in formal training by the\naveragc. individual\n\nt , = fractional time spent in on-the-job training by the\naverage individual\nClearly,\n\ndays)\n\nK = average capability of the individuals in the station\n(formal training days)\n\nN = number of men in the station\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.2526, VOL.

This relationship exhibits the characteristic \xe2\x80\x9cknee\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Refs. 4,5,6) of learnins curves, and a saturation effect:\n\nSalaries:\nCF = average salary of administrative personnel times\nnvmber of administrative personnel;\nCF = 12 X 3 = 36 ($K/year)\nCS=CKXN\n\nwhere\n\nin)\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\nal = exponential index\n\nCK = average salary of an individupl of capability K;\n\nF, = performance factor\nWe choose a value of a1 = 0.0034 on the basis of a best\nfit of the historical data.\n\nThis linear relationship between capability and salary\nTo obtain a reasonable functional form for F P ( t l ) ,we\nselect the following empirical relationship based on historical station data:\n\nFp =\n\nHiring and attrition:\n\nCH = cost of hiring cne man (= $500) times number\n\n.

Lost performance can be\nconsidered either in terms of inefficiencyor lost data. For\none optimization policy, we need to parameterize lost data\nhs\nby assigning a value to the available data. T i value of\nthe available data is dependent on the mission, its phase,\nand competing priorities (Refs. 3.8).

If one were interested in\nvalues of 50%and lower, nonlinear factors, which describe\nthe penalty of poor performance, might have to be htroduced.\n\nFigure 3 is a detailed representation of the station\noperating system shown in Fig. 1. Optimization occurs at\ntwo points (Refs. 9, 10):\n(1) Distribution of time between operating and training\n\n(2)Distribution of training time between formal and\n\nThe steady-state requirement implies that the number\nof people hired equals the number that leave and that\nthe new hires are brought U P to the average capability\nthrough the process of training. For convenience of illustration, we make the following additional assumptions:\n\n(2) There are three crews (hi = 3).\n\nThe following examples illustrate the typical results\nwhich can be obtained with the steady state model.\n\nA. Minimum Cash Expenditure to Obtain\na Required Efficiency\n\non-the-job training\nThe allocation of time between the two methods of\ntraining and operating can be optimized according to one\nof the following policies:\n(1) Minimization of the cash expenditure (CE), subject\n\nto a required minimum data recovery efficiency constraint, where cash expenditure is\n\n+ CA + CF + CS + CTexpressed\nin $K/year\n\n(2) Minimization of the overall cost\n\n(CVL):\nwhich in-\n\ncludes the value of lost dzta:\n\nCVL = CE\n\nFor this model, we assume that the station requirements\nand crew capabilities do not change with time. The dynamic model will address the problem of changing capability due to turnover and training.\n\n(1) The time period is 1 year, consisting of 250 working\ndays for each man.\n\nVI. Optimization Technique\n\nCE = CH\n\nVII. The Steady-State Model\n\n+ CF\n\nIn this example, the operating policy is obtained as a\n0,\nresult of minimizing the cash expenditure CE. For a 2 4\nannual turnover, Fig 3 shows the cash expenditure required to provide a minimum data recovery efficiency.\nThis relationship is proyided for a family of values of\nstation size (N\\and average indiviclual capability (K).\nStation size varies from 15 to 36, which corresponds to\ncrew sizes of 5 to 12. A crew size of 5 is typical of the current staffing at DSS 12 under the operating philosophy of\na central console and \xe2\x80\x9coperations engineers.\xe2\x80\x9d (Refs. 11,\n12,13). A crew size of 10-12 was typical at DSS 12 in 1970\nand is also typical of the larger stations, like DSS 14.\n\nTvmover is treated. x ~2 independent parameter (external constraint), either ar a absolute number or as a\ni\npercentage of the total nunrber of men in the station.\n\nAverage individual capability is considered from 50 to\n200 day:.. Though some individuals have capability greater\nthan 200 days, the average is unlikely to exceed that value.\nThus, 200 days is used as thc upper bound. In each figure,\n\nFor convenience of illustration, we have considered the\naverage capability of those that leave to be the same as\nthe station average, and that of people who are hired to\nbe zero. This assumption is in accord with past experience,\nbut the model does have the flexibility to spec* other\nvalues of capability for the departing individuals and the\nnew hires. T i implies that whenever there is turnover,\nhs\nnew hires will have to be given hsining to maintain the\naverage station capability.\n\nIn Figure 4, values of K above 95 are bunched closely\ntogether, which indicates that increasing capability does\nnot increase efficiency for constant N. The reason is\nobvious. At high turnover and high capability, most of the\ntime is spent in training to regain the lost capability rather\nthan in operations. Curves for N = 15 to 18 terminate at\nthe point corresponding to K = 200.\n\nthe comparisons of N and K which p. Jvide the maximum\ninformation are illustrated.\n\nThe policy of specifying a minimum requixd data recovery efficiency is close to the present snacecrait project\nprocedure. It is interesting, however, to perform a more\nglobal optimization by trading off the cost of maktaining\na station of high performance capability against the cost\nnf lost data resulting from poor performance. The following examples illustrate this second rjptirrization policy.\n6. Effect of Crew Size on Minimum Overall Cost\n\nTurnover of three men, year ( v ) and a data value o\nf\n$1200K/year ($) are consldeied in Fig. 5, where the minimum overall cost is plotted against avrrage individua!\ncapability.\nFor average capability less than 150 clays, :I statio11 size\nof 21 is optimal. Between 155 and 175, a station size of 18\nmen is optimal. For average capability greater than 175,\nthe optimal station size is 15men. In general, with increasing capability a smaller station size is indicated.\nThe data value of $ = 1200,l.B million dollars per year,\nis somewhere between what one might choose for +he\ncruise and extended mission phases of a recent Marinertype spacecraft (Ref. 3).\nC. Effect of Data Value on Crew Size\n\nWith turnover of three men/year. the station sizes\nwhich minimize the overall cost are plotted as a function\nof average individual capability, in Fig. 6. These curves\nhelp to quantify the intuitively obvious relationshp (basically inverse) between station size and average capability.\n:\nThe curve for $ = 800 turns around at K 2 40 days, indicating that it is not desirable to operate the station with\naverage capability less than 40 days.\nIn Fig. 6, for an average individual capability of 120\ndays and a data value of $BOOK/year, a station size of\n16 men is indicated. When the data value is inc .eased to\n$1800K/year, the optimal station size increases to 25 men\nfor the same average individual capability.\n\nD.

However, the use of :* f stea\\iy-state\nmodel imposes two restrictions:\n\n(1) There is no net change in statinn capability.\n(2) An averaged value is used for available data.\n\nThe dynamic model, which is an extension of the steadystate model, overcomes both of these difficulties.\n\nVIII. The Dynamic Model\nThe dynamic model exhibits the effects that changing\ndata values, average capability, and tu. :over have on\noperating policy.

The opwating policy, and more\nspecifically, the training policy, is a reflection of the overall\nlong-term needs of thc station rather than the effect of one\nstage alone. This is the esscntial difference from the\nsteady-state I .odel. For example, an extremely high data\nd u r (or required minimum efticiency) in stage 6 may iniuence trnining policies through stages 3 to 5, as in train.\ning in preparation for a launch.

An analysis of the oil presently in use\nwill be done in the near future.\n(9) Figures 1 and 2 show the rotating group of a 6.i-m\nantenna drive motor removed from DSS 42 becausc\nof blown seals and a faulty crossfeed valve. 1ntt.rnal inspection revcaled that a complete separation\nof the rotating group had occurred, resulting in\nsevtw damage to the cylinder block, seizure of one\npiston in the biock, and separation of the piston\nfrom thc shoe. A new rotating group was installed,\nand the motor was tested for smooth operation and\nstatic tested prior to being returned to the station.\nA complete change of pumps and motors is near conipletion at DSSs 11 and 12. Already there has bcen a significant improvement in the contamination levels from\nthese two stations during routine oil analysis.\n\nIn the near future, routine oil analysis will be facilitated for the 64-m antenna systems. The prograin to\nexchange hydraulic components with rebuilt and serialized components will continue until all stations are completed. Then the equipment will be monitored through\noil analysis and recording of operational time on thr\ncomponents. These two factors will determine frequency\nof replacement.\n\nJPL TECHNICAL REPORT 32.1526, VOL. XIX\n\nNetwork Command System Performance Test\nReport for Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973\n6. Falin\nNetwork Operatiorls Office\n\nThis article presents a &scription of Network Command System Perfonname\nin support of the MVM\'73 project.\n\nTests that were executed throughout the DSN\n\nI. Introduction\nThe purpose of this article is to describe the Network\nCommand System Perfoimance Test (SF\'T) conducted at\neach DSN station in preparation for the MI\'hf\'73 mission,\nand to report the status of each station at the time of\nlaunch. The objectives of the performance tests will be\ndiscussed, along with a description of the various sections\nof the test procedure. Problems uncovered and their solutions will also be discussed. The SPT is contained in Section I1 of Ref. 1.\n\nport MVM"13 operational capabilities. These capabilities\nare defined in various documents, such as Refs. 2 and 3.\nA more general statement would be lo v e d y each 5 L tion\'s capability to provide the correct modulation mode,\nphase-shift keyed (PSK) with pseudo-noise (PN) synchronization (sync). More specific objectives are:\n(1) To perform integration testing on telemetry and\n\ncommand processor (TCP)\noperational software.\n(2) To verify station capabilities after hardware or software changes.\n\nII. Objectives\n\n(3)To verify command capability while processing\ntelemetry in the same TCP computer.\n\nThe overall objective of the Network Command SPT\nis to verify that the Network Command System can sup-\n\n(4) To train station personnel with TCP operational\nsoftware.\n\n224\n\nJPL TECHNICAL RE#)RT 324526, VOL. XIX\n\n(5) To provide the stations with a prepass readiness\n\ntest.\nDuring the SPT, the telemetry and command data\nhandling subsystcm (\'TCD) operational program DOI5050-OP Model A, was exrlusively used in the TCP.\n\n111. Test Procedure Format\nIn this section, the format of the SPT, which will provide a description of the tests that were performed, will\nhe presented. The SPT is divided into four main sections:\nCountdown, Manual Mode, Automatic Mode, and Reliability. The complete testing can be performed in approximately six hours per TCD.\nA. Countdown\n\nThe Countdown section is used as a prepass readiness\ntest that is performed prior to the data transfer test wt\nih\nNctwork Oprations. Using the appropriate TCP operational software. commcnd capability is verified in the\nmanual and remote mode of operations. The modulation\nindex is adjusted and measured. Monitor interface is verified. Both timed and nontimed commands are transmitted.\n\n(c) Command register and marker bit failure\ndetection.\n\n(d) PN sync quality.\n(e) Data quality.\n\n(f) PSK data to PN sync ratio.\n(4) Exciter interface alarms and aborts.\n\n(5) Time command accura y.\n\n(6) Stack warnings.\n\n(7) PN generator failure detection.\n0. Reliability Tests\n\nIn the reliability tests, the capability to command and\nto process telemetry in the same computer is demonstrated. Continuous commanding is exercised while\nprocessing telemetry at bit rates of 335,2450, and 117.6\nkilobitsj\'s. Commanding consists of pricrity commands on\n26-s centers and timed commands on 30-s centers. The\nDIS computer is used to generate the command data, to\nprocess the commatd data from the TCP, and to process\nthe telemetry data for errors. This type of testing is performed continuously for four hours per TCD.\n\nB. Manual Mode Tests\n\nIn this section, the samc type of testing is performed as\nin the Countdown section. Additional tests arc performed\non dommand Modulator -4ssembly (CMA) configurations\nand TCP program manipulation. The ability to record .-Id\nrecover command data from an analog tape is performzd.\nC. Automatic Mode Tests\n\nThe automatic test uses the digital instrumentation\nsubsystem (DIS) computer to simulate remote command\noperations. Special ttst software is used in the DIS to\nprocm certain piogrammcd test sequences that can he\ni d y w d e n t l y svlccted I y an opcrator. Each test aequenre\ngenerates the command data, predicts results and verifies\ncommand data from the TCP, by utilizing high-+speed\ndata (HSD) interface to the TCP. These test sequences\nare processed automatidy, and the resiilts are output to\nthe operator. All HSD blocks are automatically checked\nagainst Ref. 2. The programmed test sequences are:\n(1) CMA mode changes.\n(2) Monitor interface.\n\n(3) CMA operational alarms and aborts.\n(a) Synibol rate.\n(b) Sutcankr frequency.\nJPL TECHNICAL RI#wlt 32.1526, WL XIX\n\nAn appendix has beer! added to the reliability section\ngiving the stations the cspahility to test the PN generators\nused to generate the PN sync signal. ;his was developed\nafter detecting bit rate alarms at some sthtions during the\nfirst SPTs. In this peculiar test, the 511-bit PN sequences\ngenerated by the CMA are processed as a 51 \\-bit/s telemetry channel. The processed telemetry is dhecked at the\nDIS for bit errors in the PN sequence. PN sequences containing bit errors are dumped on a 1ir.e printer.\n\nIV. Problems\nIn the following paragraph, .he problems uncovered\nand the solutions to them will be discussed.\n\nA. PSK Data to PN Sync Ratio\nThe majority of the stations did not have the correct\nratio. Analog adjustments within the CMA were made to\nobtain the correct ratio. The repair depot procedures U * L A ~\nchanged to reflect the correct ratio adjustments on the\nCMA analog drawers.\n\nB. Subcanier Frequency Alarms atid Aborts\nTwo stations experienced this problem only during\nreliability testing while processing 2450-bit/s telemetry.\n22s\n\nEngineering change order (ECO) 73-023 was installed in\nthe CMA clock counter interface to eliminate the noise\nproblem on TCP pin/pot h e s .\nC. Bit Rate Alarms and Watch Dog Time Failures\n\nDSSs 12, 14, and 42 experienced this problem. This\ncor?dition was corrected at DSSs 12 and 42 by analog\nadjustments. However, at Station 14, an emergency ECO\nwas installed as a temporary solution. The final solution\nfor all DSSs is currently being implemented by the Cognizant Operating Engineer (COE). During operations, the\nbit rate warning limits are narrow to en2.ble dstection of\n5it *ate errors caused by PN generator failures.\nD. Exciter Confirmation Phass Detector\n\nMost stations reported excessive dc drifting on the out.\nput of the exciter\xe2\x80\x99s confirmatioi rbase detector. The drid\n\nwas more pronounced at some stations. As a result, mmmand confirmation was changed to use the local confirmation within the CMA. During the investigation, a wrong\nvalue capacitor that had been installed at the factory\nwas discovered. Installing a capacitor of the corrxt value\nenabled the 2Em DSSs to meet specifications. ilowever,\na different problem exists at the 64-m DSS with Programmed Oscillator Control Assembly (POCA) installation. The development section is still working on a\nsolution to this problem.\n\nV. Status at Launch\nDSSs 12, 14, 62, 63,and 71 had successfully completed\nand passed all command system tests. DSS 42/43 comof\npleted and passed approximately 80% the command system test. DSSs 11 and 51 were not required to perform\nthe tests.\n\nReferences\n1.
