The sequence of the GRAN concept proceeds as follows: (1) A distress call is initiated by a survivor and consists of the retransmission of Omega tones and a unique identifying code. (2) Signals are frequency translated through the satellite from UHF to SHF. (3) The received signals are processed in real-time using improved skywave correction and lane ambiguity techniques. The results are processed in geographical coordinates, time of day, and unique ID. This information is then relayed to the closest rescue agent. The Omega system is described, and the satellite/GRAN compatibility is discussed. The program plan and schedule are included.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730021607, "id": "e87b3e7e3e2c48548cdabe368c8e3f30", "publicationDate": "1973-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730021607.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730021607/downloads/19730021607.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730021607/downloads/19730021607.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730021607/downloads/19730021607.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
