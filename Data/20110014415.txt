One end of each\naxis and travel pin is fixedly attached to the ball, and the other\nend of each axis pin is lodged into a notch in the first or second\nflange such that the axis pin is allowed to rotate in the notch.\nThe guide sleeve comprises two channels, and one end of\neachtravel pin is situated within one of the two channels in the\nguide sleeve. An outer magnetic cartridge causes the inner\nmagnetic cartridge and guide sleeve to rotate, and when the\nguide sleeve rotates, the travel pins move up and down within\nthe channels in the guide sleeve. The movement of the travel\npins within the channels in the guide sleeve causes the ball to\nrotate, thereby opening and closing the ball valve.\n15 Claims, 27 Drawing Sheets\n\n24\n15\n28\n26\t\n\n13\n\n29\t\n\n-\t\n\n22\n11\n\n28\n\n29\n\xe2\x80\x94 13\t\n23\n25\n27\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 1 of 27\t\n\n4\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n2\n\nFigure 1\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 2 of 27\t\n\nFigure 2\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 3 of 27\t\n\nFigure 3\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 4 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n2\n\nFigure 4\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 5 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n16\n2\n\nFigure 5\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 6 of 27\t\n\nFigure 6\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 7 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n4\n4\n16\n\n-r\n\nFigure 7\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 8 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n2\n\nFigure 8\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\n.r\n\nSheet 9 of 27\t\n\n\t\n\nZ-\n\nFigure 9\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 10 of 27\t\n\n01\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nnn\n\n28\n33\n15\n5\n\n8\n\n5\n\n9\n\nFigure 10\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nSheet 11 of 27\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\n24\n0\t\n\n15\n0\n\n`28\n\n29\n\n26 1\t.-13\n\n\t\n\nX22\n11\n\t\n\\29\n\nX26\n\n25\n27\t\n\n37\n\nFigure 11\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nJul. 5, 2011\n\nSheet 12 of 27\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\na^\n6\n\nO\n\n5\n\n5a\n\n21\n\n30\n\n2\t\n\n^\n\n.g\n\n2\n\n9\n\n2\n\n2\n\nFigure 12\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nSheet 13 of 27\t\n\n00\n0\t\n0\t\n0 0 0\n\n9\n\n0\n\n10\n\n39\n\n2\n\n_mss\nFigure 13\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 14 of 27\t\n\n31\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n7\n\n32\n\n12\n\nFigure 14\n\n12\n\n32\n\n9\n\nFigure 15\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\n\n\t\n\nSheet 15 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n12\n\n6\n\n38\n\nFigure 16\n\n38\n9\n\n^12\n6\n\nFigure 17\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 16 of 27\t\n\n/-I-Ir\n\nFigure 18\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nSheet 17 of 27\t\n\n1,\t\n\ni7\n\n0 \xc2\xb0! q\t\n\n31\n0\n\n27.\n\n\\ - \'4"^I\t\n\n/\t\n\n6\n\nFigure 19\n\n(rmx\\\t\n\n\\ \\ \\ 1)\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\n\n\t\n\nSheet 18 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n14\n\n19\n\n33\n\n33\n\nFigure 20\n\n19\n\n14\n\n14c\n\n4a\n\nFigure 21\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 19 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n33\n\n4a\n\n37\n\n14\n\n19\n\n4a\n\nFigure 22\n\n3\n\n3.\n\nFigure 23\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 20 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nFigure 24\n\n2\n\n0\n\nFigure 25\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 21 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n5a\n\nFigure 26\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 22 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nP<\n36\t\n\n27\n\n36\n\n\\13\n\n0\n7 27\n13\\\n\n36\t\n\n^/\n\nFigure 27\n\n36\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 23 of 27\t\n\nFigure 28\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 24 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\n01\n\n29\n\nFigure 29\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 25 of 27\t\n\nGL\n\nFigure 30\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 26 of 27\t\n\n27\n\nFigure 31\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nU.S. Patent\t\n\nJul. 5, 2011\t\n\nSheet 27 of 27\t\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\nN\nM\n\nLL\n\n\t\n\n1\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n\t\n\nSTEMLESS BALL VALVE\n\n\t\n\n2\n\nchemical process systems.

The second flange 9 also\n7 Outer stop\nhas a threaded aperture 6, which preferably has an inner\n8 Recess (in outer housing)\nso diameter of 0.5 inches. The threaded apertures 6 in the first\n9 Second flange\nand second flanges 1, 9 allow the valve to be hooked up to\n10 Collar\nstandard piping.\n11 Ball\nFIG. 3 is a front view of the present invention with the valve\n12 Ball seal\nfully open. As shown in subsequent figures, a ball 11 lies\n13 Axis pin\n35 between the first and second flanges 1, 9, with a ball seal 12 on\n14 Inner magnetic cartridge\neither side of the ball 11 (see FIG. 19). Axis pins 13 secure the\n14a Recess (around perimeter of inner magnetic cartridge)\nball 11 in place inside of an inner magnetic cartridge 14 that\n15 Channel (in ball)\nlies inside of the inner housing 5 (see FIGS. 10 and 11). When\n16 Ramp (in flange)\nthe handle 3 is turned, the inner housing 5 and first and second\n17 First journal bearing\n40 flanges 1, 9 remain stationary, but the outer housing 2 (which\n18 Second journal bearing\ncomprises a plurality of magnets) rotates with the handle 3\n19 Internal stop\nand causes the inner magnetic cartridge 14 to rotate as well.\n20 Third journal bearing\nThe inner magnetic cartridge 14 in turn causes the ball 11 to\n21 Fourth journal bearing\nrotate.

As shown in this figure, the external stop 7\n25 Second internal retaining ring\nhas moved forty-five degrees (45\') in a clockwise direction in\n26 Pin (of guide sleeve)\nthe recess 8 in the outer housing 2. Similarly, the handle 3 has\n27 Travel pin\n5o been moved forty-five degrees (45\xc2\xb0) in a clockwise direction.\n28 Channel (in guide sleeve)\nThe rotation of the handle 3 causes the ball 11 to rotate,\n29 External appendage (on guide sleeve)\nthereby partially closing the valve.\n30 Fifth journal bearing\nFIG. 5 is a front view of the present invention with the valve\n31 Internal recess (in first flange)\nfully closed. The handle 3 has now rotated ninety degrees\n32 Notch (in first and second flanges)\n55 (90\xc2\xb0) in a clockwise direction, as has the external stop 7 in the\n33 Longitudinal recess (in inner magnetic cartridge)\nrecess 8 in the outer housing 2. Thus, the handle 3 cannot\n34 Inner magnet\nrotate any further in this direction. (Similarly, when rotated in\n35 Outer magnet\nthe other direction, the external stop 7 will prevent the handle\n36 Tip (of axis and/or travel pin)\n3 from being rotated more than ninety degrees (90\xc2\xb0)). The\n37 Circular recess (in inner magnetic cartridge for internal\n60 valve is now in a closed position, with the ball 11 fully\nretaining rings)\ncovering the opening between the two flanges.

In this figure, the valve is in the same position as 5\nshown in FIG. 3.\nFIG. 7 is a rear view of the present invention with the valve\npartially closed. In this figure, the valve is in the same position\nas shown in FIG. 4.\nFIG. 8 is a rear view of the present invention with the valve io\nfully closed. In this figure, the valve is in the same position as\nshown in FIG. 5.\nFIG. 9 is an exploded view of the present invention with the\nfirst flange and first and second journal bearings removed. In\nthis particular embodiment, the first journal bearing 17 lies 15\nbetween the inner housing 5 and the first flange 1, and the\nsecond journal bearing 18 lies between the inner magnetic\ncartridge 14 and the first flange 1; however, the present invention is not limited to any particular number or configuration of\njournal bearings. Journal bearings are used as necessary to 20\nalleviate friction between the various moving parts.\nFIG. 9 shows the internal stop 19 located on the removable\nmagnetic cartridge 14. The mechanism of the internal stop 19\nis illustrated in FIG. 32. FIG. 9 also shows one of the two axis\npins 13 about which the ball 11 rotates. It also shows one of 25\nthe two ball seals 12 on either side of the ball 11 (see FIGS. 16\nand 17 for the positioning of the ball seals 12 inside of the\nflanges 1, 9).\nFIG. 10 is an exploded view of the present invention with\nthe inner magnetic cartridge and third journal bearing 30\nremoved. In thi s embodiment, the third j ournal bearing 20 lies\nbetween the inner housing 5 and the inner magnetic cartridge\n14. As stated above, the present invention is not limited to any\nparticular number or configuration of journal bearings. In this\nfigure, the handle 3, collar 10, fifth journal bearing 30 and 35\nsecond flange 9 have also been removed; these parts are\nshown in FIG. 13.\nFIG. 11 is an exploded view of the inner magnetic cartridge\nand guide cartridge assembly of the present invention. (This\nfigure is an exploded view of the top part of FIG. 10.) The 40\nguide cartridge assembly comprises a first half of the guide\nsleeve 22, a second half of the guide sleeve 23, a first internal\nretaining ring 24, and a second internal retaining ring 25. The\ntwo halves of the guide sleeve are joined together with pins\n26. This figure also shows the two travel pins 27, which 45\nextend from the ball 11 and travel within channels 28 in the\nfirst and second halves of the guide sleeves 22, 23 when the\nvalve is rotated (i.e., when the handle 3 is turned, thereby\ncausing the inner magnetic cartridge 14 to rotate). The two\naxis pins 13 on the ball 11 are situated within notches in the 50\nfirst and second flanges 1, 9 (see FIGS. 14 and 15) such that\nthe axis pins are allowed to rotate within the notches. The first\nand second halves of the guide sleeve 22, 23 each comprises\nan external appendage 29, which fits inside of a longitudinal\nrecess 33 on either side of the inside of the inner magnetic 55\ncartridge 14, thereby holding the guide sleeve stationary with\nrespect to the inner magnetic cartridge 14 and causing it to\nmove in sync with the inner magnetic cartridge 14. When the\nguide sleeve moves in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the travel pins 27 move up or down within the channels 60\n28 in the guide sleeve, thereby causing the ball to rotate,\nwhich in turn opens and closes the valve. In a preferred\nembodiment, the angle of the channels 28 in the guide sleeve\nis such that they allow the valve (handle) to rotate a full ninety\ndegrees (90\xc2\xb0) and the travel pins 27 to move with the direction 65\nof the channel 28 in the guide sleeve (i.e., the angle of the\nchannel 28 facilitates the mechanical movement of the travel\n\n8\npin 27 within the channel 28). The inner magnetic cartridge\n14 preferably comprises two circular recesses 37 into which\nthe internal retaining rings 24, 25 are positioned. The purpose\nof the internal retaining rings 24, 25 is to prevent the guide\nsleeve 22,23 from moving up or down (longitudinally) within\nthe inner magnetic cartridge 14 (see FIG. 18).\nFIG. 12 is an exploded view of the inner housing, fourth\nand fifth journal bearings, and outer housing of the present\ninvention. (This figure is an exploded view of the bottom part\nof FIG. 10.) The fourth bearing journal 21 preferably lies\nunderneath the lip 5a of the inner housing, between the inner\nhousing 5 and the outer housing 2. The fifth j ournal bearing 30\nlies between the inner housing 5 and the flange 9. In a preferred embodiment, there is a ball seal 12 on either side of the\nball 11 (see FIGS. 14 and 15). As shown in FIGS. 16 and 17,\nthe ball seals 12 lie within a recess 38 in the first and second\nflanges 1, 9.\nFIG. 13 is an exploded view of the present invention with\nthe second flange, collar and sixth journal bearing removed.\nThe sixth journal bearing 39 preferably lies between the collar 10 and the outer housing 2.\nThe outer housing 2, inner housing 5 and flanges 1, 9\nshown in FIGS. 1-13 are not limited to the particular shapes\nshown in these figures. For example, although the first and\nsecond flanges 1, 9 are shown as asymmetrical (i.e., they are\nnot the same), they could be symmetrical (i.e., identical). For\npurposes of the present invention, all that matters is that each\nflange 1, 9 has a ramp 16 (see FIGS. 16 and 17), the ball 1 is\nsituated between the two ramps 16, a ball seal lies on either\nside of the ball 11, and each axis pin 13 is fixed in one of the\ntwo flanges 1, 9. Similarly, there must be a guide sleeve 22, 23\nthat is attached to the inner magnetic cartridge 14 and that\ncomprises a channel 28 in which the two travel pins 27 move\n(up and down) as the handle 3 is rotated. There must be an\ninner and outer magnetic cartridge 14, 2 (as shown in FIGS.\n24 and 25, the outer magnetic cartridge is part of the outer\nhousing), the handle 3 being attached to the outer magnetic\ncartridge, that cause the guide sleeve 22, 23 to move when the\nhandle 3 moves, thereby causing the travel pins 27 to move up\nor down within the channels 28 in the guide sleeve 22, 23 and\nthe ball 11 to rotate. The particular shape or configuration of\nthe two flanges 1, 9 (as long as they each have a ramp 16 and\na threaded aperture 6 for attachment to piping), the shape of\nthe inner housing 5 (as long as it lies between the inner and\nouter magnetic cartridges and is fixedly attached to both of the\nflanges 1, 9), and whether or not there is a collar 10, are all\nirrelevant. Similarly, the shape of the outer housing 2 is irrelevant as long it contains the outer magnetic cartridge (see\nFIGS. 24 and 25) and can be attached to the handle 3.\nFIG. 14 is a perspective view of the first flange of the\npresent invention. As noted above, the first flange 1 preferably\ncomprises an external stop 7. It also comprises an internal\nrecess 31, the purpose of which is illustrated in FIG. 32. FIG.\n14 also shows the notch 32 into which one of the two axis pins\n13 is inserted. The other axis pin is inserted into a notch in the\nsecond flange 9 (see FIG. 15). The ball seals 12 are shown\ninside the recesses 38 in the first and second flanges 1, 9 (see\nFIGS. 16 and 17 to see the recesses in the flanges).\nFIG. 16 is a section view of the first flange and one of the\ntwo ball seals of the present invention. As shown in this figure,\nthe first flange 1 comprises a ramp 16 that leads from the\nthreaded aperture 6 to the ball 11 (not shown). Although\nshown as slightly tapered, the ramp does not necessarily need\nto be tapered; it simply serves as a conduit from the threaded\naperture 6 to the ball 11. The inner end of the flange 1 preferably comprises a recess 38 into which the ball seat 12 fits.\n\nUS 7,971,855 B2\n9\nFIG. 17 is a section view of the second flange and one of the\ntwo ball seals of the present invention. Like the first flange 1,\nthe second flange 9 comprises a ramp 16 that leads from the\nthreaded aperture 6 to the ball 11 (not shown). Although\nshown as slightly tapered, the ramp does not necessarily need 5\nto be tapered; it simply serves as a conduit from the threaded\naperture 6 to the ball 11. The inner end of the flange 9 preferably comprises a recess 38 into which the ball seal 12 fits.\nThe ball 11 (not shown) is situated between the two ball seals\n12, with the axis pins 13 lodged into the notches 32 in each of io\nthe two flanges 1, 9.\nFIG. 18 is a section view of the first and second flanges,\nball, and guide cartridge assembly of the present invention.\nAs noted above, the guide cartridge assembly comprises the\nfirst and second halves of the guide sleeve 22, 23 and the first 15\nand second internal retaining rings 24, 25. As shown in this\nfigure, there is preferably a slight gap between the first flange\n1 and first internal retaining ring 24 and between the second\nflange 9 and second internal retaining ring 25. The reason for\nthis slight gap is so that pressure is retained between the ball 20\n11 and ball seals 12 on either side, thereby allowing the ball\nseals 12 to create a seal on either side of the ball 11. (Note that\nthe first and second internal retaining rings 24, 25 are shown\npartially with hatched lines and partially without hatched\nlines because only a portion of the internal retaining rings is 25\nshown in cross section, as represented by the hatched lines.)\nThe position of the inner magnetic cartridge 14 in relation to\nthe other parts shown in this figure is indicated with dotted\nlines.\nFIG. 19 is an exploded view of the ball, ball seals, and first 30\nand second flanges of the present invention. This figure\nclearly shows the orientation of the ball 11 and ball seals 12 in\nrelation to the first and second flanges 1, 9. The guide cartridge assembly is not shown. In a preferred embodiment, the\nangle between the axis pins 13 and the travel pins 27 is 35\nforty-eight (48) degrees, as indicated by angle A" in FIG. 19,\nand the travel pins 27 are twenty-five (25) degrees out of plane\nwith the axis pins 13 and channel 15 in the ball 1, as indicated\nby angle `B" in FIG. 19. Angle "C" represents the angle\nbetween one of the axis pins and the center of the channel 15. 40\nIn this embodiment, angle "C" is thirty-two (32) degrees,\nwhich means that each axis pin is thirty-two (32) degrees\nfrom the center of the channel 15 on one side of the ball and\none hundred forty-eight (148) degrees from the center of the\n45\nchannel 15 on the other side of the ball. \t\nFIG. 20 is a front view of the inner magnetic cartridge of\nthe present invention. This figure shows the two longitudinal\nchannels 33 in the inside of the inner magnetic cartridge 14,\nwhich hold the guide sleeve 22, 23 in place inside of the inner\nmagnetic cartridge 14. It also shows the inner stop 19 that 50\nprotrudes from one end of the inner magnetic cartridge 14.\nThe purpose of the internal stop 19 is illustrated in FIG. 32.\nFIG. 21 is a side view of the inner magnetic cartridge of the\npresent invention. The recesses 14a around the perimeter of\neither end of the inner magnetic cartridge 14 are for holding 55\njournal bearings 18, 20. FIG. 22 is a perspective view of the\ninner magnetic cartridge showing the same parts described in\nrelation to FIGS. 20 and 21.\nFIG. 23 is a section view of the inner magnetic cartridge\nshowing the inner magnets. The inner magnets 34 extend 60\nlongitudinally (parallel with the longitudinal channels 33)\nfrom one end of the inner magnetic cartridge 14 to the other,\nwith the inner magnets aligned parallel to one another around\nthe perimeter of the inner magnetic cartridge 14.\nFIG. 24 is a section view of the outer housing showing the 65\nouter magnets (i.e., the outer magnetic cartridge). The outer\nmagnets 35 extend longitudinally from one end of the outer\n\n10\nhousing 2 to the other, with the outer magnets aligned parallel\nto one another around the inside diameter of the outer housing\n2. As shown in FIG. 25, when the inner magnetic cartridge is\npositioned inside of the inner housing 5 and the inner housing\n5 positioned inside of the outer housing 2, the inner and outer\nmagnets line up with one another in cross section, thereby\ncreating a strong magnetic force between the outer housing 2\nand the inner magnetic cartridge 14.\nFIG. 26 is a perspective view of the inner housing of the\npresent invention. In this particular embodiment, the first\nflange 1 attaches to the lip 5a of the inner housing 5 with\nscrews 4 (not shown), and the second flange 9 attaches to the\nbottom 5b of the inner housing 5 with screws 4 (not shown).\nThe purpose of the inner housing is to provide a stationary\nsurface to which the first and second flanges 1, 9 are attached.\nThus, the handle 3, outer housing 2, inner magnetic cartridge\n14 and guide cartridge assembly all rotate clockwise or counterclockwise (relative to FIG. 3), and the ball 11 rotates, but\nthe first and second flanges 1, 9 and inner housing 5 remain\nstationary.\nFIG. 27 is an exploded view of the ball, pins and sleeve\nbearings of the present invention. As shown in this figure,\neach axis pin 13 and each travel pin 27 preferably comprises\na tip 36. The tips 36 of the axis pins 13 allow them to rotate\nwithin the notches 32 in the first and second flanges 1, 9. The\ntips 36 of the travel pins 27 allow them to move smoothly up\nand down within the channels 28 in the guide sleeve 22, 23. In\na preferred embodiment, the tips 36 of the axis and travel pins\n13, 27 are comprised of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) a/k/a\nTEFLON\xc2\xae or polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE).\nFIG. 28 is a side view of the flanges, ball and travel and axis\npins. As shown in this figure, as the travel pin 27 moves up and\ndown within the channel 28 in the guide sleeve 22, 23 (not\nshown), it actually moves in an upside-down arc, as shown by\nthe dotted line with an arrow on either end. When the travel\npin 27 is in its lowest position within the channel 28, as it is in\nthis figure, the travel pins 27 are in plane with the axis pins 13\nand the flanges 1, 9. (In this position, the ball valve is partially\nclosed.)\nFIGS. 29, 30 and 31 are perspective views of the handle,\nfirst flange, first internal retaining ring, first half of the guide\nsleeve, ball and ball sleeve 12 shown in a fully open valve\nposition, partially closed valve position, and fully closed\nvalveposition, respectively. These three figures correspond to\nthe valve positions shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, respectively.\nFIG. 32 is a perspective view of the first flange and inner\nmagnetic cartridge of the present invention. As illustrated in\nthis figure, the internal stop 19 on the inner magnetic cartridge\nrides fits within the internal recess 31 on the first flange 1. The\ninternal recess 31 extends around the inner part la of the first\nflange 1 by ninety degrees (90\xc2\xb0), thereby preventing the inner\nstop 19 (and the inner magnetic cartridge 14) from rotating\nmore than ninety degrees (90\xc2\xb0). The reason it is important to\nprevent the inner magnetic cartridge 14 and guide sleeve 22,\n23 from rotating more than ninety degrees (90\xc2\xb0) is so that the\ntravel pins 27 will not travel further than the ends of the\nchannels 28 in the guide sleeve 22, 23.\nAlthough the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those\nskilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be\nmade without departing from the invention in its broader\naspects.
