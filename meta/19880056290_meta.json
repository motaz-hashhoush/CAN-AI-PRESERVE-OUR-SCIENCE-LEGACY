Most debris are within 2,000 km of the earth's surface. The average velocity of spacecraft-debris collisions varies from 9 km/sec at 30 degrees of inclination to 13 km/sec near polar orbits. Mathematical models predict a 5 percent per year increase in the large-fragment population, producing a small-fragment population increase of 10 percent per year until the year 2060, the time of critical density. A 10 percent increase in the large population would cause the critical density to be reached around 2025.", "title": "Predicting debris", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T16:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880056290, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kessler, Donald J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "1df6837c985b45568d0949b20c98dd7f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880056290, "publications": [{"volume": "26", "submissionId": 19880056290, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "5403e7fead90403b9306b1d46c78bdaf", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
