This agency-wide study is considering commercial launch vehicles, human transportation, space station logistics, and other space transportation requirements over the next 40 years. Three options are being considered for human transportation: continued use of the Space Shuttle; development of a small personnel carrier (personnel logistics system (PLS)); or development of an advanced vehicle such as a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO). Several studies related to the overall Access to Space study are reported in this document.", "title": "Access to space studies", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T19:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940019961, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Martin, James A."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Tuscaloosa, AL, United States"}}, "id": "101d9c09989749f3aa62a45b45edd801"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940019961, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940019961, "id": "b913661964b440b09f5485cea15e2a22", "publicationName": "Alabama Univ., The 1993 NASA(ASEE Summer Faculty Fellowship Program", "publicationDate": "1993-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940019961.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940019961/downloads/19940019961.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940019961/downloads/19940019961.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940019961/downloads/19940019961.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
