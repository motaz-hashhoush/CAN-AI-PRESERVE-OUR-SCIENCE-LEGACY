The semi-arid climate with slow weathering rates preserved sequences of nested younger moraines within older ones. There is a well established relative chronology and recently exposure dating provided a new set of numerical dates. The moraines span the late Wisconsin (11-25 ka) to the Illinoian (130-190 ka) glaciations. The Mono Basin area was used as a 'calibration site' to establish remote dating techniques for eventual transfer to the more inaccessible but geomorphically and climatically similar moraines of the South American Andes Mountains. Planned polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired by JPL AIRSAR (South American Campaign) and SIR-C (Andes super-site) are analyzed to establish chronologies of previously undated moraine sequences in a study of Pleistocene climatic change in the Southern Hemisphere. The dry climate and sparse vegetation is also favorable for correlation of ground surface roughness with radar polarization signature. The slow weathering processes acting over thousands of years reduce the size, frequency, and angularity of surface boulders while increasing soil development on the moraines. Field observations based on this hypothesis result in relative ages consistent with those inferred from nested position within the valley. Younger moraines, therefore, will appear rougher than the older smoother moraines at scales measurable at AIRSAR wavelengths. Previously documented effects of ground surface roughness on polarization signatures suggest that analysis of moraine polarization signatures can be useful for relative dating. The technique may be extended to predict numerical ages. The data set reported were acquired on 8 Sep. 1989 with the JPL Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) collecting polarimetric imagery at C- (5.6 cm), L- (24 cm), and P-band (68 cm) with a flight-line parallel to the strike of the mountains. Phase calibration was performed on the analyzed scene by setting the co-phase of a smooth lake to zero as described. Absolute amplitude calibration was not possible because corner reflectors were not deployed.", "title": "Preliminary results of polarization signatures for glacial moraines in the Mono Basin, Eastern Sierra Nevada", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940012273, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Forster, Richard R."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "3c6f7fcd405e4a988a7f435f8c4fee1e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940012273, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fox, Andrew N."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "3d767ef0e8a64cd8a5630230bc317368"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940012273, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Isacks, Bryan"}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "118bdd5f83ca41259f0774907ea95237"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940012273, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940012273, "id": "35e87ecc2750448da78283099422f2d5", "publicationName": "JPL, Summaries of the Third Annual JPL Airborne Geoscience Workshop.
