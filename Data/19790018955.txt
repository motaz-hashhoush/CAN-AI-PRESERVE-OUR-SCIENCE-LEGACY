E. ADEN 2-D vectoring nozzle design on the YF-17 fighter in order to provide a\nmanned flight demonstrator of 2-D nozzle technology. In support of this objective, the\nstudy examines the system design modifications required, assesses the expected per\xc2\xad\nformance and IR/RCS vulnerability of the modified aircraft, and provides estimates of\nthe overall program cost. Results indicate the program is feasible and can be accom\xc2\xad\nplished at reasonable cost and low risk.\nThe YF-17 YJ101 engines and aft structure would be modified to integrate ADEN\nnozzles with a thrust vectoring flap deflection range of 100 up to 200 down. This modi\xc2\xad\nfication would increase the aircraft weight 600kg (1325 lbs), or about 5%fully fueled.\nAn additional modification to addcanards just below the canopy requires removal of\nthe forward fuel cell, which offsets the increased weight of the ADEN installation.\nAs a result, no net weight penalty is in curred for the canard-configured YF-17/ADEN;\nhowever, fuel capacity is diminished. IA thrust reverser concept was also defined as\na desirable added capability.\nModifications to the pitch control system were defined to provide the capability\nfor direct lift, aircraft pointing, negative static margin, and enhanced deceleration.\nThe integrity of the modified system was verified for all modes of operation on the\nNorthrop flight simulator. Results are included in the study.\nAnalysis showed unvectored thrust-minus-drag improvements to be minimal,\nwith YF-17 baseline performance penalized for increased weight of the ADEN install\xc2\xad\nation and trim drag of the canard. Vectored thrust performance, however, showed\nsome potential benefits in direct lift, aircraft pointing, handling at low dynamic pres\xc2\xad\nsure, and takeoff/landing ground roll, indicating that vectored thrust operation probably\noffers the most fruitful area for flight research. Inclusion of the reverser would offer\nsignificant additional dividends in combat maneuvering and landing performance.\nFull scale development, testing, and aircraft modification can be accomplished\nin 27 months, culminating in a 12 month flight test program at NASA Dryden. Cost of\nthe program is estimated to be 15. 9 million dollars for the canard-configured version\nand 13. 2 million dollars for the version without canard. It is recommended that the\nprogram be pursued to develop experience in the implementation of 2-D nozzle tech\xc2\xad\nnology, and for the opportunity to evaluate that technology on a full scale manned\nfighter aircraft. The canard-configured version is recommended as the configuration\nto be implemented as it offers the greatest potential technical yieid.\nv\n\n?RECEPING PAGE BLANK NOT FL.\'D\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n\n\nSECTION \t\n\nPAGE\n\n\n\nSUMMARY \t\n\nv\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \t\n\nvii\n\n\n\nLIST OF FIGURES \t\n\nix\n\n\n\nLIST OF TABLES \t\n\nxiii\n\n\n\nABBREVIATIONS, ACRONYMS, AND SYMBOLS \t\n\nxv\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION \t\n\n1\n\n\n\n1.

2-1) vectoring nozzle technology through\nmodification of a YF-17 to incorporate General Electric (G. E. ) ADEN nozzles.\n\nPre\xc2\xad\n\nsented herein are the design modifications required to integrate the ADEN with the\nYF-17 airframe, estimates of the potential system performance, and the program plan\nand cost for follow-on model testing, full-scale design development, fabrication and\nflight test support.\nThe application of 2-D nozzle technology to fighter design has been a subject of\nintense interest in recent years, as it appears to offer a number of potential advantages:\nincreased survivability through reduced IR and RCS signatures, thrust-minus-drag im\xc2\xad\nprovement due to more favorable nozzle/airframe integration, and the expanded air\xc2\xad\ncraft maneuvering capability offered by thrust vectoring and reversing. These benefits\nhave been predicted as a result of numerous model test efforts and analytical studies;\nhowever, full-scale flight verification of these predictions has yet to be accomplished,\nand presents itself as a logical next step in the development of 2-D nozzle technology.\nThe YF-17/ADEN integration, shown conceptually in Figure 1, offers a timely\nand comparatively inexpensive means of demonstrating 2-D nozzle feasibility in that it\nutilizes a currently available high performance fighter that can be modified with relative\nease to accept the ADEN, an existing and proven 2-D nozzle in a notably advanced state\nof development.\n\nBoth Northrop and G. E. have invested considerable effort in 2-1)\n\nnozzle development programs that have yielded results directly applicable to the defi\xc2\xad\nnition of the modifications required to accomplish the integration of the ADEN with the\nYF-17.\n\nUnder contracts to the Navy reaching back to 1972, GE has developed the\n\nADEN concept to the point where a full scale version of the nozzle has been built, and,\nin 1976, tested in combination with the YF-17 YJ1O powerplant (Reference 1).\n\nAs a\n\nresult, the viability of the engine/nozzle combination has been established and valuable\ninformation developed on ADEN internal performance, cooling requirements, and\nactuation loads.\n\n1\n\n"lit\'\n\nFIGURE 1. YF-17/ADEN 2-D NOZZLE TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR CONCEPT\n\nDuring the above-mentioned testing, data was also taken to determine the\ninfrared (IR) emission levels of the ADEN during operation of the YJTO1.\n\nThese data\n\nwere expanded by further testing during 1978 at Navy facilities in Lakehurst, N. J.\n(Reference 2).\n\nG. E. has also defined ADEN radar cross section (RCS) characteristics\n\nthrough testing of a 1/4-scale ADEN model (Reference 3).\n\nA data base has thus been\n\ndeveloped for the prediction of the YF-17/ADEN survivability characteristics against\ncurrent and future threat missiles.\n\nIt is presented in Volume fI of this report\n\n(classified Secret) entitled "YF-17/ADEN IR/RCS Characteristics."\nNorthrop interest in the application of 2-D nozzle technology to the YF-17 led to\ninvestigations of the canard concept as a means of trimming the pitching moment\nproduced when the exhaust jet is vectored.\n\nIn 1977, Northrop model-tested a number\n\nof possible approaches to canard location and mounting which resulted in selection of\nthe final "shoulder" location (Reference 4).\n\nThis configuration was aerodynamically\n\nrefined, and canard planform and sizing information developed in further model test\xc2\xad\ning at NASA Langley in 1977 (Reference 5).\nIn later stages of the YF-17/ADEN concept development, the opportunity arose\nto test the ADEN on a 0. 10 scale model of the F-18 (for which the YF-17 is the proto\xc2\xad\ntype) as part of an investigation of non-axisymmetric nozzle concepts under joint\nNASA/NAVYk/Northrop/GE/Boeing contract NASA 4-2499.\n\nAfter Northrop/GE dis\xc2\xad\n\ncussion on how to most favorably blend the ADEN external contours with the F-18\nafterbody, the resulting integration was then tested at NASA Langley.\n\nWith the jet\n\nexhaust simulated by high pressure internal air supply, the scaled F-18/AbEN inte\xc2\xad\ngration was investigated over a range of representative flight conditions at both un\xc2\xad\nvectored and vectored nozzle settings.\n\nThe results of this test provided the basis for\n\nthe flight performance and analysis section of this report.\n\nDocumentation of the test\n\nis provided in Reference 6.\nA firm foundation has thus been laid for the definition of a full scale YF-17/\nADEN 2-D technology research vehicle.- This report represents Northrop/G. E.\nefforts to provide that definition in sufficient depth to allow a confident assessment\nof the cost for the proposed modification plan.\n\nThe study was performed in five\n\ntasks:\nTask 1: Configuration Design\nTask 2: Control System Design\nTask 3: IR/RCS Suppression Analysis\nTask 4: Flight Demonstration Technology Assessment\nS\n\nTask 5: Program Plan and Cost Estimate for Design, Fabrication, and Flight\nTest\nThe report is organized along similar lines except that the classified results -of\nTask 3 are presented separately in the aforementioned Volume II to allow ease of\nhandling of Volume I.\n\nConsequently, the results of Task 4 are presented in Section 3\n\nof this volume, and the results of Task 5 in Section 4.\n\n4\n\n1.\n\nCONFIGURATION DESIGN MODIFICATIONS\n\n1. 1 Concept Development\nThis section provides a general review of major factors influencing the develop\xc2\xad\nment of the final YF-17/ADEN concept, including applicable previous testing on ADEN\nand on YF-17 modification for non-aidsymmetric nozzles and canards, design decisions\naimed at producing an optimum combination of ADEN with the YF-17, and definition of\nvarious flight performance guidelines to allow effective demonstration of 2-D nozzle\ncapability. Design modifications are discussed more fully in following sections.\n\nFig\xc2\xad\n\nure 2 provides a three-view drawing of the final proposed modification.\nProgram Goals.\n\nThe YF-17/ADEN full-scale modification and flight test pro\xc2\xad\n\ngram has been designed to accomplish the following:\n*\t\n\nDemonstration of the feasibility of design, fabrication, and operation of a\nfull-scale non-axisymmetric-nozzle-equipped high performance fighter.\n\n"\n\nVerification of the integrity of the system during flight operation.\n\n*\t\n\nDefinition of the effects of the non-axisymmetric integration on unvectored\ncruise aircraft performance.\n\n*\t\n\nIdentification of the steady state performance and aircraft maneuvering\ncapability available in the vectored thrust mode throughout the attainable\nYF-17/ADEN flight envelope.\n\n*\t\n\nEstablishment of the in-flight IR/RCS characteristics of the YF-17/ADEN.\n\n*\t\n\nApplication of thrust vectoring to develop short takeoff and landing capability.\n\n*\t\n\nInvestigation of the maneuvering and STOL potential of a thrust reverser\n(optional).\n\nFlight Maneuver Modes.\n\nFour control modes were selected to demonstrate\n\nmaneuvering capability on the YF-17 with canards available to trim vectored\nthrust-induced pitching moments.\n\nThe first "normal" mode covers all vehicle oper\xc2\xad\n\nation with active canard but without vectored thrust.\n\nThe second "lift" mode balances\n\nlift forces on the canard, horizontal tail, and vertical component of vectored thrust,\nsuch that the pitching moments from these forces cancel each other but result in com\xc2\xad\nbined positive lift.\n\nThe third "pointing" mode uses pitching moments from the same\n5\n\nSIDEWIN DER\n\nAILERON\nT.E FLAP\n\nLEFA.\n\nAD 6659 LEXMODIFICATION\nA 66 71 TRUC UR E;O IF IC TIO N\nT\nM\nA\n\n70%\nC\n\nHINGEAC\nHINGEADEN\n\nA G7 Y\nM DF C T O\n0076 YF I?

The fourth "decel"\nmode will use negative horizontal tail deflection to cancel the vertical deflected thrust\ncomponent, producing a deceleration force from the bombined effects of horizontal\ntail drag and diminished thrust along the x-axis due to vectoring. If the canard is not\npresent, the lift mode will not be available and versatility in the normal and pointing\nmodes will be diminished.\nThrust Vectoring Capability.\n\nVectoring capabilities of the YF-17/ADEN will be\ndemonstrated by mechanically deflecting the ADEN upper flap, or VEER (Variable\nExhaust Expansion Ramp) - 100 (upward) and +200 (downward). The -100 upward limit\nis dictated by anticipated onset of separation of the deflected exhaust on the VEER.\nThe +200 downward limit represents the approximate value at which nozzle performance\nbegins to fall off rapidly with thrust vector angle. The full 30\' range will be available\nfor both dry and afterburning power settings.\nThe full-scale YJ1Q1/ADEN demonstrated at Peebles utilized a rotating hood\ncapable of deflecting thrust up to 1100 from the 0* deflection axis in order to provide\nvertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability. As the YF-17 is not designed to utilize\nvectored thrust for VTOL, this feature will be eliminated on the YF-17/ADEN; signifi\xc2\xad\ncant simplifications to the ADEN cooling and actuation systems, as well as to the aft\nfuselage external fairings, are possible as a result.\nDesign Constraints.\n*\t\n\n*\t\n\nEngine/Airframe Loads: The engine case will be designed to withstand\nloads of +10 and -\'3 g. This provides margin over the YF-17 design maxi\xc2\xad\nmum g loads of +7.33 and -3 g.\nNozzle Actuation Rates: The VEER actuation rate selected is 20\xc2\xb0/sec, the\nsame rate used for the A8 control flap, and the rate which proved to be\nsuccessful on the YJ101 round nozzle. The 20\xc2\xb0/sec speed matches favorably\nwith the 15\xc2\xb0/sec YF-17 flap actuation rate.\n\n*\t\n\nYF-17 Fuselage Modification Limits: In order to preserve the YF-17 hori\xc2\xad\nzontal tail actuation system and to minimize the area modified on the aft\naircraft structure, design changes are restricted to the area rearward of\nFS 652.25.\n\nEngine Mount System.\n\nThe engine mounting system is an important engine/\nairframe interface which provides the means of transmitting engine thrust and\n\n7\n\nmaneuver loads from the engine to the airframe structure.\n\nWith the existing YF-17/\n\nYJ101 mounting system, vectored thrust operations would introduce a large bending\nmoment into the engine casing due to the location of the vertical thrust-component -in\nrelation to the engine mounts. A bending moment of sufficient magnitude could result\nin ovalization of the thin-walled outer ducts which in turn will adversely affect engine\nclearances in the turbine and compressor. Therefore,. for the YF-17/ADEN, the mount\xc2\xad\ning system is revised to reduce this bending moment by relocating the top rear center\xc2\xad\nmount to a position further aft.\nADEN Installation in the YF-17. When installed in the YF-17, the ADEN will be\noriented such that its original centerline is cantedrexit-in 2\', and rotated exit-down 60.\nThe 2\' inward cant minimizes base area between the two ADENs, at negligible thrust\nThe 6\xc2\xb0\ndownward cant orients the ADEN hardware envelope to provide the best\'\nexternal aft fuselage closure contours. The ADEN thrust axis is readjusted to 0*\n\nloss.\n\nthrough rescheduling of the VEER and A 8 actuation.\nThrust Reverser Concept.\n\nIt is felt that the availability of in-flight thrust re\xc2\xad\n\nversing capability would greatly enhance the opportunity for investigation of maneu\xc2\xad\nvering options with the YF-17/ADEN. With this inmind, G.E. has identified a block\xc2\xad\nand-turn reverser concept which could be developed and integrated with the YF-17/\nADEN. Details of the concept will be discussed in section 1. 3.\nCanard Development Program.\n\nIn the event that a decision is made in favor of\nthe canard approach for the YF-17/ADEN, the canard will be "shoulder-mounted" as\nshown in Figure 1 with a planform of 5.37 meter 2 (57.8 sq. ft.) exposed area. The\noriginal YF-17 LEX will be removed to eliminate aerodynamic and mechanical inter\xc2\xad\nference with the canard and replaced with a wing root fairing. As the original LEX\nincludes an integral ECS intake, its removal requires a new separate ECS scoop intake.\nThe canard installation shown in Figure 2 represents considerable investigation\non the part of Northrop into the feasibility of integrating a canard with the basic YF-17\ndesign as a means of trimming vectored 2-D nozzle thrust. Figure 3 presents a flow\nchart summarizing a progressive series of tests and requirements that eventually\nestablished the most desirable canard approach in terms of location, planform, and\nexposed area.\nAs shown, the efforts were initiated in 1976 to investigate possible canard loca\xc2\xad\ntions on a .08 scale YF-17 model in the Northrop 2; 13 x 3.05 M (7 x 10 ft) low speed\n\n8\n\nLOW SPEED TEST:\n\nNORTHROP 7x10 FT TUNNEL\n\nMACH = 0.27\n\n\n8% MODEL\n\n\nLOCATIONS: NOSE, SHOULDER, CANOPY,\n\n\nPYLON (SEE FIGURE 4)\n\n\nFORCE AND MOMENT DATA\n\n\nINLET FLOW FIELD SURVEY\n\n\n\nTRANSONIC TEST\n\n!/\n\nNORTHROP 2x:2 FT TUNNEL\n\nMACH = 0.6, 0.8, 1.2\n3% MODEL\nLOCATIONS:\n\nE\n\nSHOULDER, PYLON \n\n\nSHOULDER\nMOUNT\nOCATION\n\nFORCE AND MOMENT DATA\n\n\n\nOO\nEO\n \n\n\nLOW SPEED TEST: NASA LARC 12 FT TUNNEL\n\n15% MODEL\n\n/\n\nLANGLEY\n\nSHOULDER-MOUNT LOCATION\nLANGLEY PLANFORM DESIGN \n\nFORCE AND MOMENT DATA\n\n\n\n10% NEGATIVE STATIC MARGIN\n\nPLNFR\nPAFR\n\n\nEXPOSED AREA=\n\nF NEUTRAL REQUIREMENT\nALTO\n\nFS-\n\n3 0OA\n\nFIGURE 3.

Both concepts exhibited similar lift\ncharacteristics subsonically; at Mach = 1. 2 the shoulder-mounted canard produced the\ngreatest lift. Given the added penalty to pilot visibility with the pylon-mounted canard,\nthe decision was made to concentrate further design development on the shoulder\nmounted concept.\nFurther refinement of the canard design was rendered possible through related\ntests by NASA Langley in their low speed tunnel in 1978 (Reference 5), in which the\naerodynamic consequences of replacing the YF-17 LEX with a closely-coupled shoulder\xc2\xad\nmounted canard were investigated on a 15% scale model. Of somewhat different planform\xc2\xad\n10\n\nNOSE MOUNTED\n\nOVER-CANOPY SPLIT MOUNTED\n\nSHOULDER MOUNTED\n\n\n\nPYLON MOUNTED\n\nFIGURE 4. POTENTIAL CANARD LOCATIONS\n\ndesign than the canard chosen by Northrop, the Langley canard was tested at sev\xc2\xad\neral shoulder locations, with attention directed to flow coupling effects and aircraft\nstability characteristics.\n\nWhen compared to the Northrop canard, the Langley design\n\nexhibited similar overall aerodynamic performance, with a lower actuation hinge\nmoment required.\n\nFor this reason, it was ultimately selected as the final canard\n\nconcept for the YF-17/ADEN.\n\nThe canard pivot point was located at FS 308 to insure\n\nthat the canard will stabilize in neutral position in the event of a failure in the canard\nactuation system.\n1.2 Loads Analysis\nThe use and control of vectored thrust on the YF-17/ADEN will introduce signif\xc2\xad\nicant new loading conditions into the aircraft and YJ101 engine structures.\n\nRevised\n\nload estimates were made to anticipate and design for these conditions in the modifica\xc2\xad\ntion of the engine and the airframe.\n\nFollowing discussions between Northrop and G.E.,\n\na flight condition of Mach= 0. 9, 10, 000 ft., max. power was agreed on as the most\nrepresentative worst case design loading condition for the engine/airframe.\nEngine Loads.\n\nDeflection of the ADEN VEER to vector thrust produces a cor\xc2\xad\n\nresponding vertical thrust component which acts in relation to the existing YJ1O1 mount\xc2\xad\ning system to produce a significantly increased bending moment in the outer engine\ncasing.\n\nFigure 5 shows the magnitude of this increased moment for the selected design\n\nloading condition and illustrates how, by relocating the rear link mount to a point 57.4\ninches aft of its former location, the moment is reduced.\n\nFigure 6 compares the bend\xc2\xad\n\ning moment conditions with the original and revised mount system for the worst case of\nlog loading combined with 200 of thrust vectoring. With the mount redesign, the maxi\xc2\xad\nmum bending moment in the outer duct has changed sign and increased from 1500-1950\nKgM (130, 000 in.-Ib to 170, 000 in. -lb). Preliminary stress analysis indicates that the\nexisting Ti-6A1-4V honeycomb outer duct has adequate buckling strength to withstand\nthis increase while maintaining proper engine clearances.\nThe reaction loads at the engine mounts to weight, thrust (unvectored), inertia\nand gyroscopic loads are compared in Figure 7 for the original and revised mounting\nsystems at unvectored max A/B power for the Mach 0. 9, 3050 M (10, 000 ft) condition.\nThe resulting loads, derived through analytical estimation methods, were used in the\npreliminary design of the aircraft engine support and in modification of the fuselage\nfor the new engine mounting arrangement.\n12\n\nYJ1O1/ADEN WITH 200 VECTORING\n\n\n76950 N\n117,880 N\n\n\n(17,300 LB)\n(26,500 LB)\n\n\n\n(18,800 LB\\\nIf\n600,000\n\n/\n\n/\n\nk\n\nSTANDARD MOUNT\n%\n\n(\n\nJ\n\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n\n400,000\n200,000 -\n\n1,0\n\nRELOCATED REAR MOUNT\n\n2,000\n\ng\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2,000\n\n-200,000\n\n-4,000\n-400,000\n48860 N\n\n\n\n7940 N\n(1,785 LB)\n\n(10,985 LB)\n\n\n(18,800 LB)\n\nFIGURE 5.

ULTIMATE LOADS FOR CANARD DESIGN, S.L.,\n\nM = 0.6, ac = 15a\n\n17\n\nCanard Loads.\n\nThe canard was designed for a loading condition of Mach = 0.6,\nsea level, at a deflection of 150. This condition represented the largest deflection in\nthe severest dynamic pressure (q) environment anticipated for the canard.- Although\nhigher flight Mach numbers and q\'s are anticipated at sea level, less canard deflection\nis required to perform aircraft maneuvers; for Mach = 0.6/150 deflection at higher\naltitudes, the dynamic pressure loading is less severe. The canard actuation system\nitself does not present a limit load problem as the canard is designed to drive to a\nneutral position in the event of a double failure in the system.\n\nFigure 8 summarizes\n\nthe expected canard loads.\nWind Root Fairing. Air loads for design of the wing root fairing which replaces\nthe LEX were developed using data from analysis of the baseline YF-17 with LEX, and\nmodifying the data for application to the wing root fairing. Figure 9 represents the\ndesign loading conditions for the fairing.\nAirframe Loads.\n\nMajor loading changes on the YF-17 airframe will derive from\n\ntransmission of the vectored thrust vertical component through the relocated aft\nmount to the aft structure, and from aerodynamic loading redistributions caused by\nremoving the LEX and adding the canard.\nBased on previously identified critical flight conditions for the baseline YF-17,\nrevised net fuselage loadings were developed for varying load factors at Mach 0. 9 sea\nlevel, at Mach = 0.9, 7620M (25, 000 ft), and at Mach = 1.1, 6100M (20, 000 ft.) At\neach condition the aircraft was trimmed using a combination of stabilizer deflection,\ncanard deflection, and vectored thrust. Comparison of net bending moments at\napproximately 10 stations between the ballast location and the ADEN nozzle established\nthat operation of the airplane to load factors of at least 5.0 would be permissible at all\nconditions analyzed.\nOperational Flight Envelope.\n\nBased on loads analyses presented above, YF-17\n\noperational limits are estimated for the overall aircraft at various canard deflections.\nFigure 10 presents the results, showing the overall aircraft 5-g structural envelope as\nwell as canard load limit curves for deflection angles of 7, 10, and 150. The canard\nload limit curves translate the M = 0.6, sea level, 150 deflection design capacity to\ncomparable loading at different flight conditions for the deflections shown. The loads\nanalyses and envelope presented here should be regarded as preliminary in nature with\nmore extensive analysis, particularly in the high q portion of the envelope, planned for\nthe full-scale development phase.\n18\n\n0.06 -\n\n28\n\n6\t\n\nI\n\n700\n\nVF-17\n\nI\nSLOADS\n005 -\n\n24\n\n\n\nINBODY AXES\n\n5.600\n\n\n\nIS\n\no \t\n\n20\n\nTORSION ABOUT\n\n-j,,\n\nL\n\nFS395 (NEGATIVE)\n\n*\n\n4\n\n-004\n\nco" \t\n\nI\n\no\n\n500 E\n\nI\nI\n\n-,\n\no\n\n16\n16\n\nr\nF-\n\nSHEAR\n\non003\n2\t\n\n2\n\n32\n\nr\n\n- - 400 0\n\n0\n\n<I\n\n\n\n0\n\n2\n2I\n\n2002\n\nBENDING\n\n*\n\nI\n\nMOMENT\n\nI \t\n\n2Z\n\nI\n\n\n2\n\n*8\n\n200 0\n\nw \t\nm\t\n\nI\n\n0.01 \t\n\n1\n\nI\n\n0\n\n100\n\n0I\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nSPAN STATION - IN.\n\nFIGURE 9. \t ULTIMATE AIRLOADS DISTRIBUTION ON WING ROOT FAIRING\n(DWG AD 6659) M = 1.6, 0= 3.90, q = 8788 Kg/m 2 (1,800 PSF)\n\n19\n\n18\n\n60\nYF-17 CANARD STUDY\nW 10800 Kg (23,800 LB)\n16\n\n14\nF-40\n\n12\n\n"C\n\nE\n\no\n1I0\n\n<8\n\n.\n\nD... 30\n\n-\xc2\xad\n\n.\n\n-\n\n<,\nh =10OI\n6E\n\n4\n\n20\n\ni100\n\n2\n01\n\n1\n\n0\n\nI\n\n/,\n\n01\n\n04\n\n06\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n14\n1.2\nMACH NUMBER\n\n1.6\n\n18\n\nFIGURE 10.

As previously discussed, the aft link mount located on the top\nvertical centerline of the engine rear mount ring will be moved 145.8 cm. (57.4 inches)\naft to a point over the nozzle in order to prevent excess bending movements from acting\non the engine casing. The YJ1O1 main mounts located at the mid-frame of the engine\nremain unchanged and consist of two self-aligning bearings on either side of the engine\nat the horizontal centerline that absorb the engine thrust loads, vertical loads and the\ncouple due to side or pitch maneuvers.\nRelocating the rear mount to a point over the nozzle requires minor design changes\nto the front of the augmentor casing and to the augmentor fuel injectors. The forward\nsection of the augmentor casing will be modified to include a small angle conical section\nto increase the local buckling stability (Figure 11). Flow characteristics of the baseline\nYJ101 augmentor will be preserved by adding a sheet metal flow guide in the modified\nsection to duplicate the original bell-shaped geometry.\n\nThe local increase in casing\n\ndiameter caused by this modification will require lengthening of the existing augmentor\nfuel injectors.\nADEN Casing Modifications,\n\nWith the elimination of the VTOL deflecting hood\n\nfrom the YF-17/ADEN, the opportunity for a number of design improvements in\ninternal/external aerodynamics and VEER cooling becomes available, with attendant\nweight reduction benefits. Figure 11 shows both the original and redesigned ADEN.\nAs can be seen, removal of the deflector eliminates the need for the raised arc section\nin the top of the exhaust duct which was required to effectively seal the deflector during\nVTOL operation. With the elimination of the arc, the nozzle envelope can be signifi\xc2\xad\ncantly reduced by tapering the top section of the duct. This modification in turn allows\nthe VEER actuators to be positioned on the top of the duct near the VEER hinge line\nwithout creating local discontinuities or contoured surfaces in the aircraft fairing. It\nalso permits direct ducting of the cooling air from the plenum chamber above the nozzle\nflaps to the VEER as shown in Figure 12.\nOn the original ADEN with deflecting hood the length of the casing sidewall was\nlimited in that it had to fair with the deployed deflector. In the hoodless YF-17/ADEN,\nthe casing sidewall design can now be modified to have external boattailing compatible\nwith the fuselage lines and increased length to provide improved flow containment at\nthe VEER during thrust vectoring.\n\n21\n\nREAR MOUNT\n\n\n\nA 8 CONTROL ACTUATO\n\nREARMNDEFLECTOR\n\n\n\nADEN FOR STATIC GROUND DEMONSTRATOR TEST\n\nRELOCATED A 8 \n\nAUGMENTOR CASING\nCONTROL\nMODIFICATION~TASPERE, ACTUATOR\n\nRELOCATED\n\n\nREAR MOUNT\n\n\nTOP\n\n-LONGER SIDEWALLS\n\nADEN FOR YF-17 FLIGHT TEST\n\nFIGURE 11. COMPARISON OF ADEN DESIGNS FOR THE DEMONSTRATOR TEST AND THE\nYF-17 FLIGHT PROGRAM\nVEER Design.\n\nOn the ADEN Ground Static Demonstrator, the VEER was a boiler\n\nplate design simulating aircraft mounted hardware, because it was anticipated to be part\nof the aircraft wing flap system rather than nozzle hardware.\n\nHowever, in the YF-17\n\ninstallation, with the nozzles at the aft end of the fuselage, the VEER is more ideally\nmounted to the nozzle itself. The elimination of the deflector allows the VEER to be\nhinged directly to the casing as illustrated in Figure 11. Thrust vectoring modulation\n22\n\nFIGURE 12. VEER COOLING FLOW PATHS\n\nwith the VEER from -100 (VEER up) to +200 (VEER down) is provided by three hydraulic\nactuators mounted on top of the nozzle casing.\nThe VEER must be designed to withstand the aerodynamic forces produced by both\ninternal and external flows during thrust vectoring. To accomplish this, data on the\nVEER pressure environment developed during previous ADEN testing and verified in the\nrecent NASA Langley F-18/ADEN wind tunnel investigations were used to identify and\ndesign for the worst-case pressure loads on the VEER.\nIn the initial ADEN Demonstrator tests, cooling air for the VEER was provided\nfrom an external source. During later ground test for IR measurement, flexible hoses\nwere used to duct engine fan air around the deflector to the VEER.\n\nThis arrangement,\n\nalthough not suitable for flight operation, was feasible for the IR ground tests since the\ndeflector remained in the stowed position.\nThe elimination of the deflector resolved the potential in-flight VEER coolant\nsupply ducting problem for the YF-i7/ADEN installation. Instead of flexible hoses, a\ncurved rigid cooling air supply duct connects the air plenum chamber above the nozzle\nflaps with the VEER (Figure 12). The high pressure coolant air flows from the plenum\nthrough the duct into each of the six baffled interconnected chambers of the VEER and\nimpinges on the VEER liner. The spent air then exits through five sets of holes in the\nliner to film-cool the VEER as shown in Figure 12.\nVEER film cooling slots, similar to the cooling slots used in the augmentor liner,\nare being considered as an alternate means of discharging the spent cooling air in the\ndirection of the exhaust jet, thereby contributing to increased thrust performance.\n\n23\n\nBoth ejection methods will be evaluated before making a final selection of the VEER\ncooling design.\nThe total booling flow requirements for the ADEN during afterburner operation\nareshown-in -Figure 1-3.\n\nThe -cooling-flow requirements for the YJ101 with the round\n\nnozzle are also shown for comparison.\n\nWhile a lower cooling requirement is shown for\n\nthe ADEN, it will be seen in the flight performance analysis of Section 3 that cooling\nthe ADEN actually results in an added penalty to the YJ101 performance due to higher\npressure losses through the ADEN cooling system and the unavailability of VEER cooling\nair for added combustion in the afterburner.\nIt should be noted that the 1.1% W8 cooling flow rate used for VEER cooling at\nmax A/B is sufficient to cool the VEER surface to approximately 700\xc2\xb0F during maximum\ndry operation and thus could be used to demonstrate reduced IR signature at max dry\npower settings.\nInstallation in YF-17.\n\nAs shown in the installation drawing (Figure 13) the ADEN\n\n.nozzles were angled inward 20 from the engine centerline to reduce the installed base\ndrag between the nozzles.\n\nThis change, however, resulted in mechanical interference\n\nbetween the inner A8 hydraulic actuators.\n\nA brief study was made to determine the\n\nADEN/YJ101 COOLING FLOW COMPARISON\n%W\n8\n\n%W8\n\nADEN\n\nYJ101\n\nSCREECH\nLINER\nFLAPS\n\n2.16\n4.28\n4.84\n\n4.2\n7.3\n3.5\n\nVEER\n\n1.10\n\n-\n\nTOTAL\n\n12.38\n\n15.0\n\n0.36\n\n"\n\n2.16\n3REECH\n\n2.35\n\nFIGURE 13.

However, the increased actuator\nsize and the resulting increase in the bearing mount size, spline and torque tube loads\nmade this approach unattractive. A more desirable alternative was to relocate the A 8\nactuators toward the top of the nozzle in the transition zone where the duct changes from\ncircular to a two-dimensional cross-section. With the actuators in this position the\nnozzle envelope was reduced by approximately 1.5 inches per engine, an amount suffi\xc2\xad\ncient to provide adequate clearance between engines.\nAll major components of the augmentor/nozzle are common for a right and left\nhand engine configuration. A changeover from one configuration to the other can be\nsimply made by rotating the augmentor duct 1800 to obtain the tequired 20 inward cant.\nA left and right hand engine augmentor fuel supply manifold and electrical cables for the\nignitor and flame detector will be required for the YF-17 ADEN installation to avoid\nadditional modifications to the basic YJ101 engine.\nThrust Reverser Concept. Preliminary investigations were conducted to identify\nthe most promising thrust reverser concept which could be integrated with the YF-17/\nADEN while satisfying the following guidelines:\na\n\nCapable of use in flight and during landing\n\n*\n\n50% reverse thrust\n\n*\n*\n*\n\nVariable reverse thrust\nLow internal performance penalty for forward thrust operation\nNo drag penalty when stowed\n\n*\n*\n\nRapid actuation\nReliable concept\n\n*\n\nLight weight\n\no\n*\n\nCompatible with YJ1O1\nCompatible with ADEN exhaust system and YF-17 airframe structure\n\nThe studies identified a block and turn cascade design as being the most promis\xc2\xad\ning concept. This design would use clamshell blockers to divert the flow and variable\ncascade blades to direct it (Figure 15).\n\nThe blocker and blade positions would be syn\xc2\xad\n\nchronized to provide reverse thrust modulation while maintaining constant total exhaust\narea in order to protect the engine from sudden changes in exhaust duct pressure. The\nuse of folding cascade blades to close the. reverse exhaust ports would result in less\ncompromise to the aircraft structure than an axially sliding cover and additionally,\navoid the risk of buffeting at high flight speeds which afflicts hinge mounted external\n25\n\nto\xc2\xad\n\ntoto\n\n-\xc2\xad\n\nAicl\n\nN~~~~~~ll\n\nJle.\n\necr)o\n\nDdotal\n\nVe\n\nC-\n\n.6\n\n_______ADE\n\nRdcio\n\nRdr[ n.ri\n\nFS\n\nT..1524-.\n\nA\n\n,\n\nB\n\nFIGUR\n\n98UR\n\n6W.2\n\nC\'\nOFTHE\n14.INSTLLATIN\n\nINSALLTIO\n\nSM,,- A\nT\n\nSecio 0.0\nA-A\'\n\nVERPbro\n51k T\n1070\n\nDEN0I0THEYF01\n\nOFtf HFDN NTE\nT\n\nF1\n\njedue\nii\nLeakage loss in the cruise blocker positiols would\nsplit between top and bottom of the duct,\nl.Wth exhaust eqUa\nL ea\nwould be\nt be v\nsposition provides the aft-most\nilb avoided.

A layout of the revised\nstructure is provided in drawing No. 6676, Appendix B.\n\nA verbal description is also\n\nprovided herein.\nRevisions to the YF-17 structure were limited to the area aft of FS 652.25 so as\nnot to affect the horizontal tail pivot mechanism. In modifying the YF-17 to the ADEN\naft end. all existing structure aft of FS 652.25 will be removed and stored for future\nrestoration to the original dual axisymmetric aft end.\nTo withstand the additional loads and high temperatures imposed by thrust\nvectoring, almost all of the non-axisymmetric structural revisions will be made from\ntitanium. Three new machined frames will be located at FS 660.2, FS 667.1, and\nFS 674.5, and connected to spliced extensions of upper and lower longerons and center\nkeel structure which exists at FS 652.25. At the top centerline of each engine bay a\nfitting will be cantilevered from the FS 674. 5 frame to engage the revised rear engine\nmount at FS 686. The mount fitting will be anchored back to the FS 652.25 frame by\nintercostals placed between the new frames and bound by upper and lower sheet straps.\nProvisions are made in the design of the new frames for extension of the ventral\nstructural engine bay access doors to FS 674.5.\nAft fuselage external line continuity from FS 674.5 to the point where ADEN exit\ngeometry becomes the external line close-out is provided by removable side and upper\nnonstructural fairing panel assemblies, and a lower trailing edge piece, for each\nengine/nozzle.\n\nEach upper panel assembly attaches to FS 674.5 and to a nozzle mounted\nupper trailing edge member, utilizing floating nutplates and oversize holes to prevent\nloading from deflections of the engines relative to the YF-17 airframe.

All items, with the exception of the flight test equipment, will be\nstored for future restoration of the airplane to its original configuration.\n\nThe flight\n\ntest equipment will be transferred to the vacated gun bay of the forward fuselage.\n\nIn\n\norder to compensate for the effect on airplane c. g. of the removal of the gun and am\xc2\xad\nmunition drum as well as changes in the aft end, it will be necessary to include a\n2000 lb. ballast package in the gun bay. Removal of the fuel tank will necessitate\ncapping of the fuel and vent pipes connecting to that tank.\nStructure aft of the pilot\'s seat bulkhead will be modifed to accommodate the\ncanard surfaces.\n\nA torque tube, interconnecting left and right hand canard surfaces,\n\nwill be located at FS 314, 71.1 ci (28 inches) above the horizontal reference plane and\npass through holes cut in the aircraft skin. The holes will be surrounded by external\naluminum doublers attached by rivets to exiting fastener locations, including a field\npattern of rivets.\n\nMachined aluminum bearing support fittings and canard actuator\n\nsupport fittings will be installed on FS 310 bulkhead.\n\nThe FS 317 frame will be relieved\n\nto allow actuator control arm movement, and reinforced by adding formed aluminum\nsheet doublers to maintain required strength.\n\nMachine aluminum fittings to anchor\n\nthe actuation system will be attached at the FS 325 frame as shown in Figure 19.\nDwgs 6671 and 6699, Appendix B, detail the structural changes and canard actuation\nsystem controls.\nThe canard panels, symmetrical about the chord plane, will be single spar, full\ndepth honeycomb, bonded assemblies, similar in design to the F-5 horizontal stabilizer.\nA single piece machined steel detail forms the interconnecting torque tube, root rib\nsplice, and inboard spar segment.\n\nThe L. H. and R. H. torque tubes will be taper pin\n\nspliced at the airplane centerline upon installation.

The scoops will be fabricated of molded fiberglass\nlaminate with an erosion protection coating and will be attached to existing fastener\nlocations.

Note that while the canard-configured version actually weighs less due to\nremoval of the forward fuel cell to accommodate the canard actuation system, the\ncell removal also affects flight endurance capability, as will be seen in Section 3.\nBoth breakdowns reflect the relocation of the YF-17 flight test instrumentation package\nto the gun bay; to make room for it the gun and ammunition package is removed and\nreplaced by a more compact 907 kg (2000 lb. ) ballast package to maintain a center-of\xc2\xad\ngravity location similar to the baseline YF-17.\nCenter of Gravity Characteristics.\n\nIn Figures 19 and 20, the extent of travel\n\nof the aircraft center-of-gravity (c. g.) with fuel usage is shown as a percent of mean\naerodynamic chord for the YF-17 with ADEN only (Figure 19) and the YF-17/ADEN/\ncanard (Figure 20).\n\nCurves are shown in each figure for c.g. behavior with and without\nthe flight test equipment. With the canard-configured YF-17/ADEN the forward fuel\ncell must be removed; its c. g. travel is therefore not shown in Figure 20.\nAs a prototype aircraft, the YF-17 is equipped with fuel transfer capability.\nThis offers the possibility of operation over a range of aircraft weight and c. g. loca\xc2\xad\ntions.\n\nThe YF-17 with ADEN only has a stable in-flight static margin similar to that\n\nof the basic YF-17 (1. 5%).\n\nThe YF-17/ADEN with canard will integrate the canard\ninto the pitch control system (as discussed in Section 2) and use it to maintain the same\nmargin; however, with the availability of the canard the aircraft aerodynamic center\ncan now be varied to produce up to -10% static margin with attendant trim drag benefits.\nThis option is exercised in the flight performance estimates of Section 3.\n\n38\n\nTABLE 4.\n\nWEIGHT CHANGES DUE TO YF-17/YJ101 MODIFICATION, Kg (LBS)\nYF-17/ADEN\n11165 (24,616)\n\nBASELINE YF-17\n\nYF-17/ADEN/\n\nCANARD\n\n\n11165 (24,616)\n\nREMOVE\n\n\n-126 (-277)\n\nLEX\nGUN\n\n-273 (-602)\n\n-273 (-602)\n\nAMMUNITION\n\n-127 (-2k.)\n\n-127 (-280)\n\nMISSILES\n\n-156 (-343)\n\n-156 (-343)\n\nFORWARD FUEL CELL\n\n-9\n\nFORWARD FUEL PUMP\n\n-2\n\n(-5)\n\n-671 (-1480)\n\nFORWARD FUEL\nTOTAL REMOVED\n\n(-20)\n\n-556 (-1225)\n\n-1364- (-3007)\n\nADD\nADEN NOZZLES AND\n\n\nAFTERBODY STRUCTURE\n\n+250 (+550)\n+907 (+2000)\n\nBALLAST\n\n+250 (+550)\n+907 (+2000)\n(+170)\n\nCANARD\n\n+77\n\nCANARD CONTROLS\n\n+170 (+375)\n\n+9 (+20)\n\nMODIFIED LEX\n\nNET CHANGE\n\n+1157 (+2550)\n\n+1413 (+3115)\n\n+601 (+1325)\n\nTOTAL ADDED\n\n+49 (+108)\n\n11767 (25,941)\n\nMODIFIED YF-17\n\n11215 (24,724)\n\nLESS USABLE FUEL\nFORWARD CELL\nCENTER CELL\nAFT CELL\n\n-\n\nMODIFIED YF-17 LESS FUEL\n\n-671 (-1480)\n-1415 (-3120)\n\n-1415 (-3120)\n\n-726 (-1600)\n\n-726 (-1600)\n\n8955 (19,741)\n\n9074 (20, 004)\n\n39\n\n26\n\n,671\n\n" "\n\nLB)4\n\nKg()8\n\n25\n\'11.0\n\n\xc2\xb023\n\n726Kg1,600 LB)\xc2\xad\n\n--\xc2\xad\n\n10.5\n\nm\n00\n\nZ\n\nCENTER TANK FUEL\n1415 Kg (3,120 LB)\n\n22\n\n2\n\nC\n10.0;"\n\n_\n\nI\n\nw\n\nw\nFLIGHT\n~~WITH\n\n21\n\n-\n\n.\n\nTEST EQU IP.\xc2\xad\n425 Kg (937 LB)\n\n20\n- 9.0\n\n1-0\n\n19\n\n8\n\n-\n\n-\xc2\xad .5\n8\n\n18\n17\n\n19\n\n21\n\n23\n\n25\n\n27\n\n29\n\nCENTER OF GRAVITY - PERCENT MAC\nFIGURE 20.

The normal mode of operation pertains to any flight condition that\ndoes not employ vectored thrust. In this mode the canard is active and is controlled as\na function proportional to angle of attack in order to maintain as closely as possible the\npitching moment versus angle of attack characteristics of the original YF-17 aircraft.\nFigure 24 diagrams the normal mode, showing a feedback loop added to the existing\nYF-17 control system for canard deflection.\n\nThe canard feedback gain may be adjusted,\n\nif desired, to generate varying degrees of stability, giving the aircraft the capability\nfor operation over a range of negative to positive stability margins.\n43\n\n+q\n\n+\n\n+\n\n?7 z\n\n+\n\nKqM H\n\nKV\n\n-~\n\nSTRUCTURAL\n\nCAS\n\nEerror PNA\nCO TIO S-FILOTAERT UT\nRM\nCT T\nA AO\n\nI ,\xc2\xad\n\n-\n\nYF-17 PCAS\n\n-1\n\nCANARI/VEER CONTROL SYSTEM (CVCS)\n77Z\n\nw\n\nVEER\n\nfNORMAL\n\nVEER. t NORMAL\n\nF4-1\n\nA3\n\nI\nS+1\n\n6+\nr+\n\n+VEER\n\nlo\n\nLiftV\n\nFIGURE 22.

NORMAL MODE BLOCK DIAGRAM\n\nA\n\n\n\nY-17\n\nThe three additional control modes utilize varying inputs and feedbacks from the\nexpanded pitch control system provided by the combination of the horizontal tail deflec\xc2\xad\ntion (dH), the thrust-vectoring VEER deflection angle (6V),\n(6C).\n\nand the canard deflection\n\nThe block diagram for the additional control logic to accomplish this is shown in\n\nFigure 25.\n\nThe three vectored thrust modes are characterized as follows:\n\nLift Mode.\n\nThe purpose of the Lift Mode is to produce a change in the vertical\n\npath of the aircraft without a change in pitch attitude.\n\nTo achieve this, the horizontal\n\ntail and VEER are deflectedtogether, as shown in the vector diagram of Figure 26(A).\nThe resulting moment is trimmed by. the canard.\n\nCanard aerodynamic data indicate\n\nthat the canard produces primarily a moment increment with little net effect on lift.\nMost of the vertical path response is produced by the combined lift of the vertical thrust\ncomponent, the induced lift of the aircraft afterbody, and the horizontal tail lift.\nPointing Mode.\n\nThe purpose of the pointing mode is to produce a change in air\xc2\xad\n\ncraft pitch attitude without a resulting change to the flight path.\n\nThe different pitch\n\nattitude (and angle-of-attack) that results produces a change in wing lift which is com\xc2\xad\npetsated for by a deflection of the horizontal tail and VEER.\nby use of the canard.\n\nMoment trim is obtained\n\nBecause the wing is a powerful lift producer, only small changes\n\nin attitude can be obtained before the trimming surfaces saturate.\ngrams the force moment balance for the pointing mode.\n\nFigure 26(B) dia.\xc2\xad\n\nThe pointing capability can be\n\nincreased slightly by deflecting the flaperon up, thus destroying part of the added lift\ndeveloped by the wing due to higher angle-of-attack.\nDeceleration Mode. The decel mode is designed to produce increased aircraft\ndrag and resultant deceleration at constant engine power while maintaining aircraft\nattitude. *As shown in Figure 26(C), this is accomplished by deflecting the thrust for\nmaximum thrust loss along the wind axis (X) while counteracting the resulting lift and\npitching moment with negative lift on the horizontal tail.\n\nX-axis \'thrust loss and hori\xc2\xad\n\nzontal tail drag produces the deceleration force.\n2.3 Flight Simulator Verification\nApproach.\n\nFollowing identification of the flight control laws required to implement\n\nthe Canard VEER Control System (CVCS) for vectored thrust maneuvering capability,\nthe modified system was modeled on the Northrop Large Amplitude Simulator, Wide\nAngle Visual System (LAS/WAVS) for a brief piloted checkout of the various control\nmodes.\n\nWhereas the control laws were developed using linear optimal control\n47\n\n+\n\nACTUATOR\n\nKLc.0VEER\n\n6vAIRFRAME\n\nGACTUATOR\n\n+ \n\n\nF- 7\n\n)ko-h\n\nKw~h\n\n- DG\n\nFIGURE 25.

CONTROL MODE VECTOR DIAGRAMS.\n\n49\n\nequations, the LAS/WAVS simulator employed a complete and accurate model of the\nreal \tsystem including non-linear aerodynamics and actuator models.\nThe aircraft\'s aefodynamic characteristics were used in the six degree of free\xc2\xad\ndom (DOF) equations of motion to digitally calculate the aircraft response using a\nframe time of 0. 016 second.\ntion system.\n\nThese data were used to drive the piloted, five DOF mo\xc2\xad\n\nThe YF-17 Flight Control System, including the pitch Command Augmen\xc2\xad\n\ntation System (CAS) and the canard/ADEN nozzle control system were modeled on an\nanalog computer which interfaced with the digital computer.\n\nThe time variation of\n\nselected aircraft parameters were recorded by analog strip chart recorders.\nThe flight condition investigated had the YF-17 flying level and initially trimmed\nat 0.9 Mach number at 4570M (15, 000 feet) with the aircraft center of gravity at 0. 30\nMAC.\n\nThis corresponds to a stable, basic airframe maneuver margin of 1. 5 percent.\nTo provide a meaningful tracking reference, a scaled aircraft was projected on\n\nthe earth-sky background view ahead of the pilot.\n\nThe range to the target aircraft was\n\nheld constant at 610 M (2, 000 feet) directly ahead of the YF-17 at the same flight condi\xc2\xad\ntion.\n\nA fixed sight, with a 2 mil pipper and outer 50 mil reticle, was used by an ex\xc2\xad\n\nperienced fighter pilot to tract the target aircraft.\n\nFor each YF-17 configuration\n\ninvestigated, the target aircraft was initially tracked in steady flight, where the pilot\nmaneuvered the YF-17 in pitch relative to the target to evaluate control response.\nAfter 2 or 3 minutes of this type of tracking, ihe target aircraft was given a "roller\xc2\xad\ncoaster" sinusoidal maneuver that had a period of four seconds and a double amplitude\naltitude change that corresponded to six diameters of the reticle vertically.\n\nThis type\n\nof tracking was evaluated for another 2 or 3 minutes.\nSimulated Flight Modes. Seven YF-17 cases were evaluated by the simulator\npilot. Because the modified YF-17/ADEN/canard control system was developed based\non several specific flight conditions, auto-throttle control was used to hold airspeed at\nthe condition being examined, thereby allowing the pilot to concentrate on evaluating the\nmaneuvering characteristics of the aircraft.\n*\t\n\nCase 1: Basic YF-17 - This case corresponded to the YF-17 as it is pre\xc2\xad\nsently flown, with CAS on, and was flown to provide the pilot with a basis for\ncomparison.\n\nPilot comment indicated that the basic YF-17 demonstrated\n\nexcellent tracking characteristics for both fixed and oscillating targets.\n*\t\n\nCase 2: Canards Added - The second case simulated the effect of removing\nthe LEX and adding the canards with a deflection capability of :h15 degrees\nrelative to the fuselage centerline.\n\n50\n\nWind tunnel data indicated that adding\n\nthe canards would not affect the YF-17 lift or drag appreciably but the pitching\nmoment would be influenced by angle of attack (AOA) changes and canard sur\xc2\xad\nface rotation. These effects were integrated into the response calculated by\nthe digital computer.\n\nTo minimize the destabilizing effect of the canards, a\n\nsimple fixed gain control loop was added to the analog calculations such that\nthe canard would be deflected to produce a stabilizing pitching moment in\ndirect response to any AOA change.\n\nUpon completion of the target tracking\n\nevaluation runs, the simulator pilot commented that he could not detect any\nchange in the YF-17 aircraft\'s tracking characteristics.\nPilot commentary was verified by the typical strip-chart recordings of Figures\n27 and 28 for the first two cases of oscillating target tracking evaluation.\n\nComparison\n\nof the traces shows no appreciable change in tracking performance when the canards\nare added.\nFor all the remaining cases, the YF-17 lateral CAS was left oh, but the pitch\nCAS was turned off and replaced by the canard/ADEN nozzle/horizontal tail control\nsystem. In particular, the YF-17 forward loop integration in the pitch CAS which pro\xc2\xad\nvides auto trim was turned off, and the pilot had to assume this task.\nMovement of the pilot\'s center stick now produced control.stick steering by\nblending canard, nozzle, and horizontal fail deflection.\n\nFore and aft stick deflection\n\nwas restricted to 6.35 CM (2. 5 inches) about neutral; a deflection of that magnitude\nproduced a change in aircraft pitch angle of six degrees (0. 1 radian) and a climb rate\nof 10 percent of flight speed 229 CM per sec at 2290 CM per sec (90 fps at 900 fps).\nThe pitch trim button or "coolie-hat" switch on the control grip was utilized to allow\nmechanization of a linear combination of the lift and rotation modes.\n*\n\nCase 3: Pitch Control - This case evaluated the canard/ADEN/horizontal tail\nmodified pitch control.\n\nPilot comment indicated ease of tracking while ma\xc2\xad\n\nneuvering about a fixed target; however, when attempting to follow the\noscillating target, the pilot complained that the nose was not as responsive\nwithout the pitch CAS on, and that it tended to wander.\n\nFigure 29 provides the\n\ntraces for Case 3.\na\n\nCase 4: Pointing Mode - For this case, the "coolie-hat" switch was used~to\ndemonstrate aircraft pointing.\n\nWhen the switch was moved to the aft position,\n\nthe aircraft rotated nose-up 0.5 degree in pitch and when moved to the for\xc2\xad\nward position, 0.5 degree nose-down.\n\nAlthough the pil6t could move the\n\n51\n\nI( UP)\n\n\'w\n\n..\n\n-\n\nERROR.\n\n.\n\n--\n\nf_=-\n\nI\n\nLo\n\n.\n\n..\n\n_u\n\n,f,.f\\\n\n,U\n\n-\n\n. r,; . \\-.\n\n/>\n\n-\n\n0\n\nVELOCITY.\n\n"/\\/-\n\nQ\n\'\n\n/\n\n\\ gi\n\nCM PER S EC\n\nUP)\n(+ \n\n\n.\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nMILLIRADIANS\n\n-3000-\n\n.\n\nAl\n\nPITCH\nTRACKING\n\nVERTICAL\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\'. .\n\n%\n\n-\n\n.\n\n..\n\n..\n\n.\n\n-100\n\n3S5\n\n.\n\n$\n\nVERTICAL\n\n,\n\n\n\n4 -\n\n-\n\n\n-\n\nt\n\n7\n\n-\n\n--f\n\n-V\n\nACCELERATION,\n\nIs.--\n\n.\n\n10\n\n-\n\n.\n\n---\n\n-\n\n-V\n\n- ..\n\n( UP)\n\n.TOHR,,T -t.\n0\n\n\'-: -- _N\n\nDEGISEC\n\n-10\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n-- -L :--,r:\nY\n\n-\n\nc-\n\n..\n\nY"\n-"_ --- ?L\n_____---___,\'_;\'-\n\n"j_\'Tv_\n1\n\n.\n\n20\n\n.. . .\n\nI+ UP)\n\nPITCHANGLE\nDEGREES\n\no\n\n-\n\n---\n\n.\n\n. . ..\n\n-\n\n----\n\n------\n\n-20\n\n+T E.

After tracking\nthe fixed target, the pilot commented that moving the "coolie-hat" gave him\nthe expected pitch response initially; however, he requested that the oscillat\xc2\xad\ning track amplitude be reduced by a factor of three before attempting that\nevaluation. After repeated attempts to track the oscillating target, the pilot\ncommented that he could not adequately perform the task due to too much lag\nin the pitch response. Figure 30,presents a typical response obtained during\nthe tracking of the fixed target.\n*\t\n\nCase 5: Direct Lift - For the fifth case the "coolie-hat" switch was used for\nlift control instead of the pitch control evaluated in the previous case. When\nthe pilot moved this switch to its aft position, the aircraft developed a\n3. 96 \tM/sec (13 fps) rate of climb. With the switch in the forward position,\na 3. 96 M/see (13 fps) rate-of descent resulted. This case was only evaluated\nusing a fixed target. After several runs in both switch positions, the pilot\ncommented that use of the switch did indeed change lift without changing\npitch angle, however the response was sluggish. Figure 31 presents a\ntypical response obtained for this -case.\n\n*\t\n\nCase 6: Direct Lift with Center Stick - The sixth case again used direct lift\'\non the "coolie-hat" switch but in this case the center stickwas also connected\nto the canard/VEERAorizontal tail control system. After tracking the fixed\nand oscillating targets, the pilot acknowledged the lift augmentation but com\xc2\xad\nplained of complications due to the other inputs. Figure 32 presents a typical\n\nresponse for this case.\n" \t Case 7: Deceleration Mode - The seventh case used only the speedbrake\nswitch and center stick. When the speedbrake switch was activated, the\nADEN nozzle was deflected down, the horizontal tail was deflected trailing\nedge up to offset the nozzle lift, and the canrad was deflected to counter\xc2\xad\nbalance the resulting pitching moment. The net effect was an increase in\naircraft drag due to these control surface deflections which caused the air\xc2\xad\ncraft to decelerate at 0. 1 g or 0.98 M/sec 2 (3.2 fps 2). The auto throttle\nwas connected and the pilot used his center stick for trim. This case was\nevaluated using a fixed target. This pilot pointed out that while deceleration\nwas experienced, it was not outstanding. Figure 33 presents a typical re\xc2\xad\nsponse for this case.\nDiscussion of Simulator Results.\n\nDue to schedule requirements, the simulator\n\ninvestigations of the YF-17/ADEN/canard handling characteristics were limited mainly\nto verification of the modified cbntrol system concept.\n\nLift, aircraft pointing, and\n55\n\nPITCHaI\nTRACKING\nERROR.

This serves to confirm that the strengths of 2-D vectored thrust\nlie in the lower q portions of the flight envelope where canard/nozzle/horizontal tail\neffectiveness would be more marked.\ntoward this regime.\n\nFurther simulator activity would be well-directed\n\nUse of a wing flap, aileron, or flaperon to "dump" lift on the wing\n\nshould also be considered as an effective way to increase canard/VEER/horizontal tail\nauthority for aircraft pointing.\n2.4 Control Hardware Implementation\nGeneral Approach.\n\nIn order to handle the expanded control requirements pre\xc2\xad\n\nsented by the canards and the deflecting nozzle Variable Exhaust Expansion Ramp\nVEER), a digital flight control computer will be added to the existing YF-17 control\nsystem to provide the canard/VEER control (CVC).\n\nIn the modified system the canard\n\nand VEER will be used to produce movement in the pitch axis; therefore, the pitch con\xc2\xad\ntrol augmentation computation task originally performed by the baseline system will be\ntransferred to the CVC to facilitate the integration of the canard and VEER computa\xc2\xad\ntional and hardware requirements.\n\nThe CVC computer will provide sensor signal man\xc2\xad\n\nagement, actuation control, and redundancy management/failure monitoring for both\nthe VEER and the canard actuation systems and perform the control law computations\nfor the horizontal tail, VEER, and canard surfaces.\n\nThe conceptual arrangement of\n\nthe modified pitch axis control is shown in Figure 34.\nThe lateral-directional control axes and the maneuvering flap control system will\nremain unchanged.\nYJ101/ADEN Controls and Actuation.\n\nThe engine exhaust nozzle (A 8 ) actuators\n\nwill be of thesame design as those used on the existing ADEN; i.e., cylindrical ram\n60\n\nACCELEROMETERS\n\nPILOT\nCONTROL\nPANEL\n\nRATE\nGYROS\n\nEACTUATOR\n\n37EE\n\nVEER\n\nACTATO \n\nSEER\n\nFSYTEM"\n\n\n\nCCA\n\n\n\nFIGURE 34. MOWIFRED PITCH AXIS CONTROL\n\n\nR\n\nactuators are used, one on either side of the ADEN assembly.\n\nAn electrical position\n\nlinear variable differential transducer (LVDT) provides a feedback signal to the\nelectrical control and to the aircraft.\nThe A8 actuators will be controlled by the existing YJ101 nozzle control system\nwith minor modifications to accommodate actuator differences from the .YI01. The\nactuators will be positioned directly by an engine-driven, variable displacement hy\xc2\xad\ndraulic pump.\n\nThe pump is controlled by a signal from an engine-mounted electrical\n\ncontrol which in turn responds to an input demand from the engine main fuel control.\nBecause the actuator stroke-to-area relationship on the ADEN differs from that re\xc2\xad\nquired for the current YJl01, it will be necessary to modify the nozzle area versus\npower lever cam in the main fuel control, and to modify the electrical control by\nchanging the fan speed-to-min. nozzle area limit schedule, the nozzle area-to-augmentor\nfuel schedule, and the hydraulic pump driver amplifier gain.\nVEER actuation will be provided by three cylindrical ram actuators of the same\ndesign as those used for A 8 control, each with a load capability of at least 21000N\n(4800 Ibs) and a stroke of 6.86CM (2.7 inches).\n\nThese actuators are larger than\n\nnecessary for the VEER but they will fit in the available space and using them will\nminimize program cost and simplify logistics.\nof each actuator to limit the total stroke.\n\nA collar will be added to the rod end\n\nElectrical position transducers (LVDT\'S) will\n\nbe included to provide a feedback signal for control.\nHydraulic power to the three rams will be supplied from the aircraft hydraulic\nsystem and metered by a single, two-stage ele6tro-hydraulic servovalVe.\n\nControl and\n\nfailure monitoring the VEER actuation system will be accomplished by the CVC com\xc2\xad\nputer. In case of failure, the actuation system will revert to a hydraulic bypass/damper\nmode.\nCanard Controls/Actuation.\ncanard actuation system.\n\nFigure 35 provides a perspective view of the proposed\n\nIn order to provide for safety of flight and full time avail\xc2\xad\n\nability of the canard as an active surface, a dual hydraulic series triplex secondary ac\xc2\xad\ntuator used on the F-ill aircraft was chosen to provide the necessary redundancy and\nreliability for fail operational capability. In the event of a complete failure of the actu\xc2\xad\nation system, the canard will fail to a neutral position, thereby avoiding the potential\ncontrol and flutter problems associated with a free-floating failure mode. This actuator\nwill provide the input to two dual hydraulic mechanical input/feedback power actuators\nto rotate the common torque tube and two attached canard surfaces about the canard\n62\n\nCANARD PIVOT\n\nA\n\nTORQUE TUBE\n\nPOWER ACTUATOR\n\n2\nSERVOACTUATOR\n\n-1O\n\n.... ,,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n""\n\n-;,\n\n%J\n\n..\n\n/\n\nI,\'/\n\nFIGURE 36.

The-digital CVd compster will fincor\xc2\xad\nporate all the new and modified pitch axis control functions required by the YF-17/\nADEN system. To minimize design risk, the computer will be synthesized from fully\ndeveloped and proven elements. The basic design will be triplex in order to satisfy the\nredundancy and actuation interface requirements associated with the utilization of canard\nsurfaces. Mode logic, control law computations, and failure monitoring/redundancy\nmanagement will be provided by three synchronous digital processors with nonvolatile\nmemory.\nWith the addition of the triplex canard actuation, the opportunity exists if desired,\nto upgrade the dual redundancy (fail-safe) of the existing YF-17 pitch control augmenta\xc2\xad\ntion actuation to triple redundancy (fail -operational/fail-safe) by providing for transfer\nof the horizontal tail pitch control function to the similarly effective canard and its\ntriplex system in the event of a failure in the existing pitch CAS.\nThe interface to the VEER actuation system on each engine is simplex, with the\nrequired fail-passive characteristics provided by comparative monitoring between left\nand right VEER positions.\nThe proposed implementation would utilize the Sperry Flight Systems Model\nSDP-175 computers currently used in commercial aircraft applications (Figure 36). A\nbrassboard, military version of this computer, Model MK-175, was extensively evalu\xc2\xad\nated in a triplex arrangement on the Northrop Advanced Flight Controls Test Stand with\nexcellent results. The same evaluation also validated the analog circuits involved in\nsensor and actuation interface, and redundancy management.\nSensors. Implementation of the modified YF-17/ADEN control laws will require\nsensing or normal acceleration, pitch rate, and pitch stick position to provide required\nstabilization and dynamic performance. These sensors are currently available on the\nYF-17 in dual redundant packages. To achieve the required triplex redundancy without\nincurring the cost of repackaging, another set of these dual sensors will be added to the\nexisting system. The CVC computer will provide the signal shaping and synthesis as\nrequired; for example, angle-of-attack perturbations that may be required as a feedback\nparameter to compensate for the destabilizing effect of the canard surfaces would be\nsynthesized from normal acceleration and pitch rate.\n\n64\n\nSr\n\n\n\ncpa\n\n\n\nFIGURE 36.

Vernier\ncontrol of the LIFT and ROTATE modes will be provided by a thumbwheel type control\nlocated on an F-18A type throttle lever.

Per\xc2\xad\nformance is shown for the YF-17 modified strictly to integrate the ADEN nozzle (this\nconfiguration will be referred to as "YF-17/ADEN" or "ADEN only") and the canard\nmodification which additionally removes the LEX and adds the shoulder-mounted\ncanards (this configuration will be referred as \'YF-17/ADEN with canard"). To\nprovide background information, the ADEN nozzle/afterbody thrust-minus-drag char\xc2\xad\nacteristics and shoulder-mounted canard aerodynamics are developed first, followed\nby an overall assessment of the aerodynamic performance changes which derive from\nintegration of the ADEN and canard. The additional capability provided by thrust rever\xc2\xad\nsing is illustrated through discussion of two hypothetical combat encounters. Potential\ntakeoff and landing performance improvements available through thrust vectoring are\nalso evaluated.\nBecause the YF-17 performance capability is classified information, flight per\xc2\xad\nformance results presented here are incremented from or normalized to baseline YF-17\nperformance.\n3. 1 ADEN/Afterbody Performance Effects\nThe aeropropulsive consequences of replacing the dual axisymmetric nozzle\ngeometry of the YF-17 with the two-dimensional ADENs were established through the\ninvestigations conducted on the 0. 10 scale F-18/ADEN integration at NASA Langley\n(Reference 6). Due to similarity of the YF-i? and F-18 designs, results of testing on\nthe F-18/ADEN are expected to be fully representative of the YF-17/ADEN modification\nalso.\nThe ADEN configuration, shown installed on the F-18 model in the Langley 16 ft.\ntunnel in Figure 37, was one of three non-axisymmetric nozzle design integrated with\nthe F-18 airframe design and tested over a range of operating conditions. Also investi\xc2\xad\ngated were the GE 2-D convergent-divergent concept and the Boeing AIN variable center\nplug design. Using high pressure air to simulate the jet plumes, F-18/ADEN afterbody\n\n69\n\nFIGURE 37. \t ADEN NOZZLES INSTALLED ON 0.10 SCALE\nF-18 MODEL IN NASA LANGLEY 16 FT.

As an initial step in the Langley investigations,\nthe F-18 dual axisymmetric aft end was tested to establish a reference data base for\ncomparison with the non-axisymmetric integrations. Data obtained generally agreed\nwell with pretest predictions based on previous measurements of YF-17 nozzle/after\xc2\xad\nbody drag.\nFollowing establishment of the dual-axisymmetric reference performance levels,\nmeasurements of the ADEN unvectored thrust-minus-drag characteristics were ob\xc2\xad\ntained. Typical static results for the ADEN and for the dual-axisymmetric aft ends are\nshown in Figure 38 for the cruise nozzle setting, and in Figure 39 for the reheat setting.\n70\n\nFigures 40 through 42 present wind-on data for representative flight conditions of\nMach = 0. 8, cruise nozzle, and Mach = 0.9 and 1.2, reheat nozzle.\nA more general comparison is. presented in Figures 43 and. 44 in terms. of-the\ndrag-oriented parameter CT-D = (FG - D)/ qSw, to gain a better understanding of the\nComparisons of axisymmetric\n\nADEN integration in terms of aircraft performance.\n\nand ADEN thrust-minus-drag characteristics in this form are presented in Figure 43\nfor the cruise nozzle setting,\' and in Figure 44 for the reheat geometry.

The ADEN\nnon-axisymmetric design reduces the number of available pathways for leakage flow\nloss compared to the axisymmetric translating flap convergent-divergent (TFCD)\ndesign, and as a result requires less cooling flow (see comparison, Figure 13, Sec\xc2\xad\ntion 1.) For non-afterburning conditions, this results in slight to moderate performance\nimprovements as shown in Figure 46.\n\nWhen the afterburner is employed, on the other\n\nhand, the ADEN cooling system produces a larger flow pressure loss (with less re\xc2\xad\ncoverable momentum) than the TFCD system.\n\nThis loss, compounded by the unavail\xc2\xad\n73\n\n0.36\n\n0:32 \t\n\n0\xc2\xad\n\n0.28 \t\n\n____\n\nM0.6\n\n/\n\n0.24 \t\n\n0.20 \t\n\n_\n\n/_\n/ 0.8\n\noo.,o \t\n\n/\n\n0.16\n\n09\n\n0.12\n\nINTERMEDIATE\nPWR\n\n0.08\n\n1.2\n0.04\n\nAXISYMMETRIC\n\n-\n\n0\n\n=ADEN\n\nm\n\n.\t\t\n\nAIRCRAFT OPERATING RANGE\n-0.04\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nI\n8\n\nI\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nNOZZLE PRESSURE RATIO\n\n74\n\nFIGURE 43.

Figure 47 shows,\nfor static conditions, how this effect operates to produce varying vector angles with\npressure ratio. Also shown in Figure 47 is the prediction of this effect, based on\nmethod of characteristics approach, that analytically confirms the behavior of the ex\xc2\xad\npansion ramp normal force.\n\nThe effect of this phenomenon in terms of CL variation on\nthe F-18 model metric afterbody is shown in Figure 48 for several representative\noperating conditions.\nVectored Nozzle Performance.\n\nLangley test results of the ADEN at the vectored\n\nsettings predictably indicated the presence of induced lift on the F-18 aft end: This\nphenomenom has been seen in previous testing of 2-D nozzles and can be attributed to\nchanges in airflow, on aircraft surfaces near the nozzle exit, that are caused by deflect\xc2\xad\ning the jet plume.

The data shown have been generated from canard development\ntests conducted by Northrop (Reference 8) and by NASA Langley Research Center\n(Reference 5).\nLongitudinal Characteristics. Figures 50 and 51 present the effect of the canard\non basic untrimmed longitudinal aerodynamics with flaps undefected at Mach numbers\nof 0. 8 and 1. 2. Inspection of the lift curves reveals that the canard configured aircraft\nhas equal or slightly improved lift capability when compared to the baseline YF-17.\nHowever, it can be seen that, at positive deflection angles, the canard generates drag\nwith essentially no increase in lift. This is because the increased downwash of the\ncanard at positive incidence reduces the lift of the main wing panel. As expected, the\naddition of tle canard produces a forward shift of the aerodynamic center which varies\nslightly with Mach number. Positive deflection of the canard is seen to produce a large\n79\n\n1.0\n\n,\n020j\nC- ="i\n\n_0.8\n\n\'.1\nsC=0\n\nsC= 0, 10, 20\n\n0I/F_\n\n0.680=\n\n"I\n\nw\no U-0.6\n\nI\n\nF-177\n\n0,6\n\n0.4\n\n-\n\njYF-17\n\no\n\n0.2/\n\nou\n\n-I\n5\n10\nANGLE OF ATTACK, a., DEG\n00\n\n15 03\n\n"\n\n0.2 O\n0.1\nC\nPITCHING MOMENT COEFFICIENT\n\n-C.1\n\nCM (0.30 :)\n\n1.0\n\n0.6\n\ni\xc2\xad\nz\nIul\n\nw\nU\n\n.-\xc2\xad\n\n7=Y\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nJ\n\n_\n\nI"\n\n{\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n-:YF-17 WITH CANARD\n6 H == \xc2\xb030% MAC\n0\n\n_C.G.\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n0.20\n\n5n/5 f = 0\xc2\xb00\n\n0.24\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n0.28-\n\n0.32.\n\n" D -DRAG COEFFICIENT\n\nFIGURE 50.

Canard and horizontal tail deflection angles, computed for minimum trimmed\ndrag at each lift coefficient, are also shown. Due to the large drag penalties associated\nwith deflection of the low aspect ratio uncambered canard, the computed optimum\ncanard deflection is near zero until moderate to high lift coefficients where the hori\xc2\xad\nzontal tail deflection saturates at -5O. It should be noted that these data are presented\n\nfor the flaps undeflected.\n\nCanard-wing interactions with wing leading and trailing\nedge flaps set to produce nearly optimum camber distribution could conceivably alter\nthe trends developed from the analysis of the flaps-up data.\nWith the canard installed, the forward shift of the aerodynamic center, coupled\nwith the available center of gravity range with the ADEN nozzle installation, will allow\nthe YF-17 ADEN/canard configuration to be balanced at a negative static margin of up\nto -10%, thereby reducing the canard deflection required to trim at a maneuver CL and\nconsequently reducing the trim drag. Optimum trimmed polars for operation at -10%\nstatic margin: are shown in Figures 54 and 55 for the same flight conditions as the 0%\nstatic margin polars of Figures 52 and 53.\nLateral-Directional Characteristics. In order to assess the incremental effect\nof adding a canard to the baseline YF-17 configuration, Northrop low speed tests of a\nshoulder-mounted canqrd were analyzed along with the NASA Langley data of Reference\n5 on three canard configurations run in the LaRC 12 ft. low speed tunnel.\nFigure 56 presents data from the Northrop tests (Reference 7) which show the\neffect on the lateral-directional departure parameter Cn~dynami c of first removing\nthe LEX from the baseline YF-17, and then, the effect of adding the shoulder-mounted\ncanard to the LEX-off configuration. These data are with leading and trailing-edge\nflaps undeflected. Figure 57 presents the same data with the flaps deflected to\n5f = 100/120. In each case, the canard produces a slight degradation in dynamic\ndirectional stabilitybelow approximately 200 angle of attack and a significant improve\xc2\xad\nment at higher angles compared to the baseline YF-17. It should be noted that the\noptimum flap setting for maneuvering on the YF-17 is Sn/Sf = 250/0\', and that with\nthis flap setting, the level of Cndyna*i c for the YF-17 is significantly higher than for\nflaps up or partial flaps. Therefore, the stability levels shown in Figures 56 and 57\nfor the canard configuration can be expected to be similarly improved atan optimum\nflap setting.\n82\n\n1.0\n\nI\n\n4,\n\nu\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nw0.8\n\n/!\n\nI-\n\nU\xc2\xad\n\nui\n\n0.64_____\n\no\n\no\n\n5l\'\nAN GLE OF ATTACK,\n\n1\n70\n,DEG\n\nU-I\n\n0I\n\n5\n\n5\n0\nHORIZONTAL\nTAIL DEFL 85H, DEG\n\n10\n5\n0\nCANARD DEFLECTION,\n6C, DEG\n.\n\n1.0\n2I\nTMAX,\nqSw\nII\n\n0.8\n\nLu\n.6\n\nh =9140 M (30,000 FT)\nYF-7 BASELINE\n\n0.4\n\nw\nLU:E-\xc2\xad\n\nYF-17 WITH CA]NARD\n6V = 0o\nSTATIC MARGIN = (A\n\nt,\n}-//\n2 0.2\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.04\n\n008\n\n0.10\n\n0.16\n\n0.20\n\n0.24\n\n0.28\n\nCD - TR IMMED.DRAG COE FF ICIENT\n\n\nFIGURE 52.

EFFECT OF CANARD LONGITUDINAL POSITION\n\nCU\n\n\n\nSince the previous data are for a canard configuration which is slightly different\nfrom the final or preferred canard configuration, the NASA Langley canard test data\nwere reviewed to determine the sensitivity of lateral-directional stability to changes in\ncanard planform, location and area. Figure 58 presents the effect of longitudinal posi\xc2\xad\ntion of the Langley canard on Cno6dynami c in the stall angle-of-attack region. The data\nare seen to be very sensitive to canard position.\n\nThe most forward canard position\n\ncorresponds approximately to the position of the smaller, lower sweep Northrop canard,\nand the levels of Cn dynamic for these configurations compare well. However, the\nextreme sensitivity to canard placement indicated by the Langley data suggest that\nfurther study of the lateral-directional characteristics of the final canard configuration\nshould be undertaken prior to the design freeze.\n88\n\n3. 3 Effect of Thrust Vectoring on ADEN/Canard Aerodynamics\nLongitudinal Effects.\n\nTrimmed vectored thrust drag polars at Mach = 0. 8 and\n\n1.2, shown in Figures 59 and 60, represent the optimum combination of canard, hori\xc2\xad\nzontal tail, and effective thrust deflection angles for minimum drag. Vectored thrust\nforces include the induced afterbody effects discussed in Section 3.1. Examination of\nthe figures indicates that at low lift coefficients, minimum drag is achieved at very\nsmall positive effective thrust vectoring angles, due to the large drag penalties in\xc2\xad\ncurred when the canard is deflected to trim the aircraft in the vectored thrust mode.\nIn fact, at moderate to high lift coefficients, minimum drag is obtained at a given lift\ncoefficient by vectoring the nozzle to negative angles so that minimum canard deflection\nis always achieved.\n\nOnly after the maximum negative effective thrust deflection angle\n\nof -2 degrees is reached does the canard come into play as a trim device.\nLateral-Directional Characteristics.\n\nVectoring the ADEN nozzle is not expected\n\nto affect the lateral-directional stability of the aircraft.\n3.4 Aircraft Performance Without Vectored Thrust\nIn this section, flight performance without thrust vectoring is evaluated for the\nADEN-only configuration (identified as "YF-17/ADEN" or "ADEN only") and the ADEN/\nSection 3.5 will pro\xc2\xad\n\ncanard modification (identified as "YF-17/ADEN with canard").\n\nvide an analysis of aircraft performance with vectored thrust.\nConfiguration Weights. Replacement of the YF-17 axisymmetric aft end with the\nADEN installation results in a net weight increase of 1325 lbs.\n\nOn the YF-17/ADEN\n\nwith canard, this weight increase is offset by the necessary removal of the LEX and the\nforward fuel cell and contents to allow installation of the canard actuation system.\n\nThe\n\nremoval of the cell compensates for the total increase in weight due to the ADENs,\ncanard actuation hardware, and canard.\n\nConsequently, the performance of the YF-17/\n\nADEN with canard is evaluated at the same aircraft weight as the baseline YF-17.\nOn the YF-17/ADEN, the removal of the forward fuel tank and contents is not\nnecessary and its retention is desirable from the standpoint of flight test endurance.\n(Ah increase in flight time of 10 minutes, from 50 minutes to an hour, has been esti\xc2\xad\nmated as representative.)\n\nPerformance for this configuration is therefore presented\n\nat full fuel capability with the consequent ADEN weight penalty, and also at weight equal\nto the baseline YF-17 (which could be accomplished by off-loading fuel) in order to\nisolate the aerothermodynamic differences for this configuration.\n89\n\n0\n\n.. . . . ...\n\n\n-0.0020\n-0.0040\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2"--STTC MARGIN\n\n__\n\n<1\n-0.0060 \t\n\n0\n\n-- STATIC MARGIN -10%1\n\n-0.0080\n\nI-\n\nR(D\n\xc2\xad\n\nN\n0 .4\n\nw\n\n\'\n\no\n\n-\n\n10\n\n<2\n\n\n2<\n\n\n\n15 \t\n\no\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n-5\n\n_<\n\n1\n\nwL) 15\n>\n\no\n\n___,,,,____\t\t\n\n,D\n\n1\n\n5\n\n_\n\n_\t\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\nfL-i\n\n090\n\n\n0\t\n\n0.6\nTRIMMED LIFT COEFFICIENT\n0.4\n\n0.2\nCL\n\n\'-\n\n0.8\n\nFIGURiE \t59. \t EFFECT OF THRUST VECTORING\nM = 0.8 /9140 M (30K)\n90\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n-0.0020\n-0.0040\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-0.0060\n\n-0.0080\n\n<\n\n[--STATC MARGIN O0i\n-10%\nI --- TAT C\n\no z\n5\n\nw\n\nuw\n\nS10\n0\nz\n<0\n\nW,.a\n\n151\n5\n\n_\n\n_\n\n__\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\nLtl W\nU-\n\nD\n\nLu F\nfn\n\n10\n\n15\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\nCL -TRIMMED\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nLIFT COEFFICIENT.\n\nFIGURE 60.

When the weight penalty is included, the YF-17/ADEN air\xc2\xad\ncraft suffers a noticeable increase in time to reach final altitude at both power settings.\n\'fhe YF-17/ADEN with canard exhibits the effects of the canard aerodynamics shown in\nFigures 50 and 51, requiring a significant increase in time to reach the 12190M\n\n(40,000 ft.) intermediate power climb ceiling, and a moderate amount of additional\n\ntime to reach the 50,000 ft. maximum power climb ceiling.\nAcceleration Performance.

As can be seen in Figures 62 and 63 the same pattern emerges as\ndid for the time-to-climb analyses; that is, for the YF-17 with ADEN only, unpenalized\n.for weight and operating at intermediate power, the acceleration time does not differ\ngreatly from the baseline YF-17.\ntion appears.\n\nWhen the weight penalty is included, some degrada\xc2\xad\n\nWhen this evaluation is made for maximum power accelerations, an\n\nadvantage develops for the ADEN only configuration at the lower altitude which is\n92\n\nINTERMEDIATE POWER\nMACH\n\n=\n\n0.6 TO 0.95\n\nMAXIMUM POWER\nMACH\n\n=\n\n0.6 TO 1.2\n\nADEN\n+ CANARD\n\n(Aw=0)\n\nADEN\n+ CANARD\n\n30\n\n(Aw=0)\n\n25\n\n20\n\n\n\nLU\n\n\n\nADEN\n\n\nONLY\n\n\nAW=600 Kg\n(AW=1325#)\n\n15\n2:\n\nfl~o\nar\n\no\nL-\n\nADEN\nONLY\n\n(Aw=o)\n\n;\n\n"\n.:.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\n\n-:::\n-\n\nONLY\nAW=600 Kg\n(AW=1325#)\nADEN\nONLY\n(AW=0)\nFIGURE 62.,UNVECTORED ACCELERATION PERFORMANCE\n(h = 3050 m (10,000 ft)\n\n93\n\nINTERMEDIATE POWER\nMACH = 0.6 TO 0.95\n\nMAXIMUM POWER\nMACH = 0.6 TO 1.3\n.AD EN\n+ CANARD\n\n20\n\n-\n\nLU\n(Wo\nz\n<\n\n(AW=0)\n\n--\n\n15\nADEN\nON LY\n\n=AWOKg\n\n(AW=1325#)\n\nI- W\n\nADEN\n\nADEN\n\n\n+CANARD\n(AWN600\n\nONLYKg\n\n\nKg\n\n\n(-4W0)\n\n(AW=1325#)\n\nt-\n\nADEN\nLY\n\nADEN\nON LY\n\n(Aw=0)\n\nW\noON\n\n(Aw=o\n\n\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n\n-5\n\n\n\nFIGURE 63.

The YF-17/ADEN With canard exhibits large increases in accelera\xc2\xad\ntion time which is indicative of the increased minimum drag associated with the canard,\nespecially at the higher Mach numbers.\nThe detrimental effect of the canard, it is felt, derives in large part from the\nrelatively rudimentary development the canard-configured concept has undergone to\nthis point compared to the highly refined wing/LEX combination on the baseline YF-17.\nFurther optimization of the canard/wing aerodynamics during the detailed design phase\nis expected to improve the currently-exhibited inferior performance of the YF-17/ADEN\nwith canard.\nCruise Performance.

EXCESS POWER AND MANEUVER PERFORMANCE, MACH = 1.2\n\n1.6\n\n3. 5 Aircraft Performance With Vectored Thrust\nFigure 67 provides a summary of the expanded performance capability that can\nbe expected for the YF- 17/ADEN when the ADEN thrust vectoring capability is\nutilized in combination with the shoulder-mounted canard.\nExcess Lift Development. Excess lift at cruise angle of attack can be developed\non the YF-17/ADEN with canard by vectoring the thrust and increasing the engine\npower.\n\nIn this way, engine thrust available in excess of that required to overcome\n\naircraft drag is used to maintain the thrust-equal-to-drag condition with the hori\xc2\xad\nzontal thrust component while at the same time developing an added lift force with\nthe vertical component.\n\nThis component joins with lift developed on the horizontal\n\ntail, and with lift developed in deflecting the canard to hold the aircraft in its\noriginal trimmed attitude. Employing this mode at the Mach = 0.8, 9140M (30000 ft.)\ncondition, it was found that 0. 5g excess lift could be developed, at which point the canard\nand horizontal tail deflection limits established for th\'s study were reached. (150 and\n50 respectively) At the Mach = 1. 2 condition, these limits were not encountered and\nall the available excess thrust at 200 deflection was converted to obtain 1. 25g\'s of\nexcess lift.\n\nIn analyzing this mode of operation, it was found that the YF-17/ADEN\n\nwith canard actually prefers to develop excess lift on the horizontal tail and canard,\nwith vertical thrust coming into play only at the point the horizontal tail reaches its\ndeflection limit and an alternate trim force is required to balance the canard lift.\nFuselage Pointing Capability. Another advantage in the decoupling of pitching\nmoment from lift generation afforded by the availability of thrust vectoring and\ncanard forces is the ability to use canard/horizontal tail/vectored thrust deflections\n(61/H/6T) - to trim the aircraft at a pitch attitude other than its trimmed angle-of\xc2\xad\nattack flying with unvectored thrust. However, use of 6C\'6H\' and 6T to perform\nthis manuever at Mach = 0. 8 resulted in a fuselage rotation of only 1. 2\'. At\nMach = 1.2, the rotation was essentially non-existent. A prime factor in this limited\ncapability is the strong lift production from the basic YF-17 wing. Rotating the fuselage\nalso rotates the wing and generates large changes in wing lift that must be counter-acted\nto maintain the aircraft in a trimmed condition.\n\nThe authority available through\n\n8 c,6 H\'\n\nand 5T is largely consumed in providing this counter action, leaving little additional\nmoment generating capability for large rotations of the aircraft. It has been suggested\nthat, during the detail design phase, investigations should be made into the possibility\nof using the wing control surfaces to counteract wing lift changes due to angle-of-attack\nchanges, leaving the\n\nc/ H/\n\nT\n\nauthority available for increased pointing capability.\n97\n\n*\n\nEXCESS LIFT AT CRUISE ANGLE OF ATTACK:\n+0.5 g AT 0.8M/9140 M (30,000 FT)\n+1.25 g AT 1.2M/9140 M (30,000 FT)\n\n*\n\nFUSELAGE POINTING CAPABILITY\n1.2 DEG AT 0.8M/9140 M (30,000 FT)\nNEGLIGIBLE AT 1.2M/9140 M (30,000 FT)\n\n*\n\n14-16 KNOT REDUCTION IN MINIMUM SPEED\n\n&\n\nLOW SPEED CONTROLLABILITY IMPROVED\n\n*\n\nNEGLIGIBLE CHANGE IN SUSTAINED TURN RATE\n\n*\n\nTAKEOFF GROUNDROLL REDUCED 61 M (200 FT)\n\n*\n\nLANDING:\nAPPROACH SPEED REDUCED 9.5 KNOTS\nGROUND ROLL REDUCED 11-13%\n\nFIGURE 67. YF-17/ADEN CANARD PERFORMANCE\nSUMMARY, VECTORED THRUST\nMinimum Speed at Partial Power.\n\nBy deflecting the ADENs, the minimum\n\nspeed of the YF-17/ADEN with canards can be reduced by 14 to 16 knots, due to\nsmall induced afterbody lift increments and to direct lift derived from the deflected\nthrust. Speed reduction is limited by the available canard and horizontal tail\ndeflections for trim.\nManeuvering at Low Dynamic Pressure.\n\nFigure 68 demonstrates the contri\xc2\xad\n\nbution that vectored thrust can offer to YF-17 maneuvering during low Mach number,\nlow q conditions.\n\nAs shown, under these conditions angular acceleration produced\n\nin the pitch plane by the horizontal tail alone approaches zero. Use of thrust\nvectoring in this situation allows retention of pitch acceleration capability regard\xc2\xad\nless of horizontal tail effectiveness.\n\nThis is particularly important to an aircraft\n\nsuch as the YF-17 which is capable of trimming out in a high lift/drag attitude at\nlow speeds, thereby undergoing rapid deceleration into the speed regime of\nFigure 68, where, as shown, vectored thrust pitch authority rapidly becomes a\ndesired added capability.\n98\n\nLU\n\nen\n\n4\nz\n0\n\n__\n\n3\n\nLI\n\n_"\n\n\n__\n\n_\n\n2\n\n0\n\nh =4570 M (15,000 FT\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n0.1\nSI\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\nKg per meter 2\nMACH NUMBER - M\n100 200360 500\n1000\nI\nI\n\n\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n01\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n_< \n\n\nI\n\n125150\n\n\n\nDYNAMIC PRESSURE - q #/FT\n\n2\n\n\n\nFIGURE 68.

Although this manuever was eval\xc2\xad\nuated as a rapid means of inducing deceleration by vectoring to maximum deflection\nfor horizontal thrust loss and trimming with negative 6H for additional drag, the\nfact that it is performed at high power settings severely limits the deceleration\nforce produc~d.\n\nIf deceleration capability over and above that offered with the\n\nexisting YF-17 speedbrake is desired, it will be more effectively developed\nthrough implementation of the in-flight thrust reverser concept discussed in\nSection 1.\nEffect of Thrust Vectoring on Takeoff Performance.\n\nTo determine the effect\n\nof thrust vectoring on the takeoff performance of the YF-17/ADEN with canard,\nanalysis was made of the take-off sequence up to main gear lift off (MGLO)\nperformed with and without the utilization of vectored thrust.\n\nTable 5 delineates\n\nthe assumptions for the unvectored thrust takeoff; Table 6 provides the same\ninformation for takeoff with vectored thrust employed.\n\n99\n\nTAKEOFF SEGMENT\nBRAKE RELEASETO NOSEWHEEL LIFTOFF\n\nMAXIMUM\n\nNOSEWHEEL LIFTOFF\n\nMAXIMUM\n\nMAIN GEAR LIFTOFF (0 = 100)\n\nMAXIMUM\n\n8\n\nPOWER\n\n6\n\nH\n\nC\n\n6T\n\n00\n\n00\n\n-12\xc2\xb0/-6\'\n\n00/150\n\n00\n\n-12 0 /-6 0\n\n0 0 /16 \xc2\xb0\n\n00\n\n00\n\nTABLE 5.

As thrust levels\non landing are relatively low, the maximum VEER deflection angle of 20 degrees can be\nutilized without saturating the canard trim capability.\n\nUnder these conditions,\n\ntherefore, the maximum reduction in approach speeds is achieved at the highest\npower setting that does not produce accelerated flight.\n\nThe no-flare landing approach\n\nattitude provides a higher thrust level than a flared landing approach attitude.\nFigure 73 indicates the approach speed reduction which can be achieved at\nthe current maximum allowable VEER deflection of 20 degrees.\n\nAnalysis was\n\nextended to greater angles to determine what further speed reduction could be\nobtained before the canard trim authority was saturated.\n101\n\n0.10\n\n0:075\'\n\n2\n\n0.050\n\n0.025\n\nC N\'\n.0 0E\n\nLIECTION "\nLIIT\n\n,\n\n10\n\n0\n\n20\n\nCANARD DEFLECTION -6C\n\n30\n\n(DEG)\n\nFIGURE 69.

EFFECT OF MAX VEER DEFLECTION ON LANDING GROUND\nROLL DISTANCE\n\nThe payoff in terms of landing ground roll for the maximum VEER deflection\nof 20 degrees is shown in Figure 74.\nA preliminary estimate was also made to determine the reduction in ground\nroll that could be obtained if the thrust reverser were available for use during\nlanding. Assuming deployment of the reverser at touchdown and a nominal reverser\neffectiveness of 60%, it was calculated that the YF-17 ground roll at a typical land\xc2\xad\ning weight on a dry surface could be reduced by approximately 56% with the use of\na reverser.\n\nA reverser becomes even more effective when the landing is being\n\nmade on a wet or icy runway.\n3. 6 Effect of In-Flight Thrust Reversing on Maneuver Performance\nIn order to establish the desirability of incorporating the block and turn reverser\nconcept discussed in Section 1 into the full-scale YF-17/ADEN modification, studies\nwere made to determine the impact of thrust reversing capability on YF-17/ADEN per\xc2\xad\nformance potential.\nBased on test results of a number of similar reverser designs, an inflight\nreversing efficiency of 60% of available gross thrust was used as representative of\nperformance that could be obtained with the proposed concept.\n\nrn-flight deceleration\n\nof the YF-17 employing reversed intermediate power thrust was calculated over a\nrange of flight speeds at altitudes of 3050M (10, 000 ft.) and 10670M (35, 000 ft.) to pro\xc2\xad\nduce the performance shown in Figure 75. For comparison, deceleration performance is\nalso shown at the same conditions for the baseline YF-17 utilizing its speedbrake, with\nthrottles chopped to idle,\n\nAs expected, the thrust reverser offers a much greater\n\ndeceleration capability. The dropoff in speedbrake deceleration force exhibited at\nhigher Mach numbers is due to hinge-moment-limited maximum deflection angles.\nHead-on Engagement. The consequences of the reverser deceleration advan\xc2\xad\ntage were illustrated by analytically simulating a one-on-one head-on engagement of\nthe YF-17 with a high performance threat where both aircraft are initially operating\nat Mach = 1.2, 3050M (10000 ft). The combat scenario assumed that both the threat and\nthe YF-17, upon visual identification, would pull a maximum decelerating turn in an\nattempt to gain a heading advantage.\n\nThis maneuver drives both aircraft to the\n\nvelocity where maximum lift and turn rate are developed.\n\nAfter reaching this point\n\nthe load factor is reduced and engine power increased to maintain speed and minimize\ndecay in the turning rate.

DECELERATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THRUST REVERSEREQUIPPED AND SPEEDBRAKE-EQUIPPED YF-17\n\n106\n\nreverser were evaluatdd for this type of encounter and yielded the results contained\nin Figures 76 through 79.\n\nFigure 76 shows the deceleration rates, and Figure 77\n\nthe turning rates of the three aircraft configurations during the encounter.\n\nIn\n\nFigure 77, it can be seen that the threat (due to an inherently higher drag configura\xc2\xad\ntion) decelerates to is peak turning rate faster than the YF-17 with either speedbrake\nor reverser, but that its peak turn rate is lower.\n\nFigure 76 and 77 illustrate the key\n\ncontribution of the reverser; i. e., it allows the YF-17 to decelerate at the same rate\nas the threat and to reach its peak turning rate earlier than the speedbrake-equipped\nYF-17.\nThe consequences of this performance are shown in Figures 78 and 79; that is,\nthe thrust reverser configuration enters the gunfiring envelope for the threat (within\na range of 3000 feet in a 60 \xc2\xb0 aft cone) in approximately 33 seconds, whereas the speed\xc2\xad\nbrake configuration does not enter the same envelope until over 8 seconds later.\n\nAs\n\nFigure 79 shows, even though the YF-17 enjoys a peak turning rate advantage over the\nthreat, deceleration available with the speedbrake does not allow the aircraft to begin\nconverting this turning rate to heading gains until approximately 20 seconds into the\nencounter.\nIt is also noteworthy that the reverser-equipped aircraft is operating at inter\xc2\xad\nmediate power during this maneuver and can therefore disengage from combat at\nintermediate forward thrust whenever desired by merely stowing the reverser. The\nspeedbrake is used at engine idle power and several seconds are required to transition\nfrom idle to intermediate power for disengagement.\nRear Approach Gunfiring Engagement.\n\nIn another scenario, reverser-equipped\n\nYF-17s were pitted against a speedbrake-equipped defender in a rear-approach gun\xc2\xad\nfiring attack. Figure 80 diagrams a typical encounter with maneuvering initiated at\na range of 914M (3000 ft).\n\nUpon becoming aware of the attacker, the defender, operating\n\ninitially at Mach= 0.9, deploys the speedbrake and enters a 7g level turn in an attempt\nto cause the attacker to overshoot.\n\nThe attacker, conversely, attempts to avoid over\xc2\xad\n\nshoot while tracking the defender for maximum gunfiring opportunity.\n\nAs indicated in\n\nFigure 80, the speedbrake-equipped attacker exceeds the gunsight tracking load limit\nat four seconds into the turn, and at slightly over six seconds reaches the maximum\nturn rate allowed by aircraft structural limits.\n\nAs a higher turn rate is required to\n\nremain within the defender\'s trajectory, the attacker must cease tracking, i. e., over\xc2\xad\nshoot. When equipped with a reverser, however, the YF-17 utilizes the enhanced\ndeceleration capability to maintain gunsight tracking for almost six seconds, and never\n107\n\n1.2\n\n\n(10,000 FT) \t\n\nTHREAT\'\n\nYF-17 WITH SPEEDBRAKE\nYF-17 WITH REVERSER\n\n0.8\n\n0.6 \t\n\ns/B OFFO\nMAX A/B\n\n\'\n\n-MAX A/B\n\n,.\n0.4\n\n. ...... ........ :\n\n\n%_\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nt-SECS\n\nFIGURE 76.

AVAILABLE GUN FIRING TIME FOR VARIOUS INITIAL SEPARATION\nDISTANCES, REVERSER AND ATTACKER EQUIPPED YF-17\n\n3,000\n\ndoes exceed aircraft structural limits that would require departure from the defender\'s\ntrajectory.\nFigure 81 summarizes the results of a number of such analyses for varying\ninitial separation distances at an altitude of 3050 M (10, 000 ft). It is evident that, as\nthe initial range increases, the reverser affords an increased available time for gun\xc2\xad\nfiring before the 6g sight limit is reached. Curves are also shown for elapsed time\nuntil overshoot is imminent due to aircraft structural limitations. Note that, for\ninitial ranges greater than 274 M (900 ft.), the reverser prevents overshoot from\noccurring, whereas with the speedbrake overshoot eventually occurs in all cases\nanalyzed.\nSimilar studies were run at 10670 M (35,000 feet); however, the effects of in\xc2\xad\ncreasing altitude reduce the thrust available for deceleration as well as the aircraft\nmaximum lift capability, and at 10670 M (35,000 feet) the reverser is no longer capable\nof preventing overshoot. The advantages of in-flight thrust reversing therefore would\nappear to be best applied at lower altitudes.\n\n112\n\n4,\n\nPROGRAM PLAN AND COST\n\nThis section describes the program plan and estimated cost for full-scale devel\xc2\xad\nopment, flight qualification, and flight test support of the YF-17/ADEN aircraft.\nThe overall program plan, scheduled to be accomplished in 39 months, is sum\xc2\xad\nmarized in Figure 82. The initial detail design, hardware procurement and fabrication,\nand system verification testing will be pursued independently by G. E. and Northrop on\na coordinated basis.\n\nAs the program progresses, G. E. and Northrop efforts will be\n\ncombined to jointly oversee the integration and preflight checkout of the YJ101/ADEN\nin the modified YF-17. The joint effort will also provide support for the final 12 month\nflight test program to be performed by NASA Dryden.\n\nMONTHS FROM GO-AHEAD\n\n6\n\n12\n\nis\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\n" \tDETAIL DESIGN &\n\n\nDEVELOPMENT TESTING\n\n\nSFABRICATION & AIRFRAME\nMOD.\n\n\nG E.\n \n\n\n" DETAIL DESIGN\n\n\n" NOZZLE FAS.

Estimated program cost break\xc2\xad\ndowns and overall cost are presented at the conclusion of the program description.\n4. 1 G.E. YJ1O1/ADEN Modification Program\nFigure 83 provides a more detailed look at projected G. E. responsibilities dur\xc2\xad\ning the full-scale modification phase of the YF-17/ADEN program.\n\nEfforts during\n\nthis phase will be concentrated on finalizing the various ADEN detail designs, develop\xc2\xad\ning manufacturing drawings, and fabricating and obtaining necessary hardware.\nExhaust Duct and Nozzle Detail Design.\n\nAs shown in Figure 83, GE has pro\xc2\xad\n\njected a twelve month effort to accomplish the detailed design of the ADEN YJ101\naugmentor, nozzle actuators, modified control, and ground support equipment.\n\nPar\xc2\xad\n\nticular attention will be paid to those elements of nozzle mechanical design which\nbecome more critical in a non-axisymmetric, as opposed to an axisymmetric, design.\nThese include:\n"\n*\t\n\nDeflection of flat walls under pressure\nDistortion of flat walls due to thermal gradients in structural ribs\n\n*\t\n\nDimensional stability of flat inner walls due to non-uniform skin temperatures\n(hot streaks)\n\n*\t\n\nEffect of deflections and distortions on operating clearances and leakage\ncontrol sealing effectiveness\n\n*\t\n\nSevere vibration excitation potential in flat panels between ribs and result\xc2\xad\ning fatigue problems\n\n*\t\n\nEfficient distribution and control of cooling flow\n\n*\n\nControl of leakage at the interfaces of moving parts.\n\nThe final product of this detail design effort will be manufacturing drawings\nsuitable for use in fabrication.\nInstrumentation.\n\nEffort will also be applied during the detail design effort to\n\ndefine the instrumentation required on the engine and exhaust system to accomplish the\nfollowing objectives:\n*. \t Monitoring of engine and nozzle operating conditions to assure safe operation\nof the system.\n\n114\n\nI\n\nMONTHS FROM GO-AHEAD\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n42\n\n36\n\nDETAIL DESIGN\n" EXHAUST DUCTAND\nNOZZLE\n\n\n" INSTRUMENTATION\n" CONTROLS AND ACTUATION\nSYSTEM\n\n\n" ENGINE PERFORMANCE\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n\nHARDWARE PROCUREMENT\n& TEST\n" EXHAUST DUCT AND\nNOZZLE\n\n\n" CONTROLS AND ACTUATORS\n \n\n" GROUND SUPPORT\n\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\n\n" ENGINE\nINITIATE AT\n\n\n12\nREFURBISHMENT -.

E. during the detail design\n\nperiod are the control schedule definition and identification of required board modifica\xc2\xad\ntions to accomplish -the one main engine control change and three electrical changes\nidentified as necessary for the control system redesign.\n\nA 8 and VEER actuator designs\n\nwill be finalized; as noted in the review of control system changes, the same actuator\nwill be employed for both applications with a stroke-limiting collar added to the VEER\nactuators.\n\n\nEngine Performance Methodology.\n\nEfforts will be initiated at the start of detail\n\ndesign to develop the data reduction programs needed to calculate engine and nozzle\nperformance during flight test.\n\nThe YJ101 engine cycle deck will be modified to inte\xc2\xad\n\ngrate the results of eventual preflight calibration testing so that it can be used to\nidentify in-flight thrust and inlet weight flow values.\nExhaust Nozzle and Duct Hardware.\n\nAs detail designs become finalized and\n\nmanufacturing drawings become available, hardware procurement and fabrication will\nbegin.\n\nManufacturing metlods and planning will be tailored to produce cost effective\n\ndemonstrator hardware within the allotted time frame.\n\nThe manufacturing effort will\n\nbe closely followed by Design Engineering to assure that the quality and cost objectives\nare maintained throughout the production process.\n\nBecause of the time required to\n\nfabricate a demonstrator nozzle, manufacture of some long lead items are scheduled\nto begin during the detail design phase of the program.\n\nTo accommodate this require\xc2\xad\n\nment, manufacturing drawings of these items will be the first released during the de\xc2\xad\ntail design effort after the final nozzle design is established and approved by NASA.\nThe, basic hardware to be procured to the YJ1O1/ADEN modification will be:\n*\n\n3 YJ101, refurbished\n\n*\n\n3 ADENs, 2 new and 1 modified/refurbished\n\n*\n\n3 augmentor sections, 2 new and 1 modified/refurbished\n\n*\n\n3 VEERS, new\n\n*\n\n3 sets engine/nozzle controls, modified YJ101\n\n*\n\n3 sets (2) A8 actuators, 2 new sets and 1 existing set\n\n*\n\n3 sets (3) VEER actuators, new\n\n\n\nThe three YJ101s are currently being utilized in the YJ-17 flight test program\n\n\nand are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).\n\n\nAs noted, two completely new ADEN nozzles will be fabricated; the third or\n\n\nback-up nozzle will be the existing ADEN demonstrator nozzle designed, fabricated\n\n\nand tested under NAVAIR R&D Project 4566 (Reference 1).\n116\n\nThis nozzle, however,\n\n\n\nwill require modifications including the relocation of the actuators, the addition of a\nVEER, a new mount configuration, the removal of the V/STOL deflector, and addition\nof a tapered upper casing surface as discussed in Section 1. New augmentors complete\nwith a new fuel system will be required for all three engines. A conversion kit to\nchange from right to left hand engine installation will also be required. This kit will\ninclude a fuel supply manifold and electrical leads for the igniter and flame detector.\nControls and Actuation Equipment.\n\nProcurement of controls and actuation hard\xc2\xad\n\nware will begin during the detail design effort to allow adequate time for fabrication\nand testing of the hardware prior to installation on-the engine. The main engine control\nand the electrical control will both be modified as discussed in Section 2. Each unit\nwill then be bench tested. At the same time, actuators for the ADEN and VEER will\nbe manufactured and tested individually. A test will then be conducted on the assembled\ncontrols and action system to assure hardware compatibility and to verify satisfactory\noperation of the system prior to installation on the engine.\nGround Support Equipment.\n\nThree rubber wheeled dollies will be procured for\n\nthe transportation, maintenance, and storage of the augmentor/exhaust nozzle assem\xc2\xad\nblies. The dollies will be existing models modified to accept the YJ101/ADEN assem\xc2\xad\nbly. All other ground support equipment, such as starting carts, already exists at\nEdwards AFB and can be utilized without modification.\nYJ101 Engine Refurbishment. A major consideration and pacing item in the YF17/ADEN program is the refurbishment of the three YJ101 engines that will be required\nin order to pursue the flight test phase.\n\nAt the completion of the current YF-17/YJ101\n\nflight test program in 1981, the engines will have been extended to the limits of their\noriginal intended design life and a major overhaul \'of all three engines will be necessary\nif they are to be further utilized for the YF-17/ADEN program.\n\nBased on a projected\n\nschedule of one hour of flight testing per week for 12 months, (about 50 hours) plus pre\xc2\xad\nflight checkout runs, each refurbished engine must be capable of 50 hours extended life.\nThe refurbishment has been estimated to require from 21 to 27 months and, as indicated\nin Figure 82, if the reworked engines are to be available for the scheduled checkout\ntests, the refurbishment process must be initiated 6 to 12 months prior to the start of\nthe ADEN detail design.\n\n117\n\nThe engine refurbishment is planned to be funded as a separate program. Figure\n5-C provides a detailed schedule of the overhaul process. At the inception of the re\xc2\xad\nfurbishment, the history of the three YJ10 engines will be reviewed and an assessment\nof the remaining life of the critical and long lead time parts will be made. Hardware\nreleases will be made at contract go-ahead for those parts pre-judged as requiring re\xc2\xad\nplacement. Based on teardown/inspection results, additional parts will be identified\nfor procurement or repair.\n\nMONTHS FROM GO-AHEAD\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\n" YJ1O1 ENGINES (3)\n\n\nAVAILABLE, REFURBISH-\n\nMENT BEGINSI.\n* \t PROCURE NEW HARDWARE\n\n\n(6 MONTHS UNCERTAINTY\n\n\n\nFACTOR)\n\n\n" TEAR DOWN AND INSPECT\n\n\nENGINES\n\n\n" REWORK & REFURBISH\n\n\nEXISTING HARDWARE\n\n\n" BENCH TEST/CHECKOUT\n\n\n\nACCESSORIES\n\n\n" ASSEMBLE 3 ENGINES\n\n\n" INSTALL INSTRUMENTATION\n\n\n" PREPARE TEST FACILITY\n\n\n" 10 HOUR ENGINE CHECKOUT\n\n\n" SHIP TO NASA LERC\n\n\n" NASA LERC CALIBRATION\n\n\n" \t FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM\n\n\nBEGINS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 84.

At the completion of the engine refurbishment, a static\nload test of one engine/nozzle will be performed to verify the structural integrity of\nthe engine casing and mount arrangement with the increased span between mounts that\nresults from relocating the rear mount aft to react the thrust vector loads as described\nin Section 1.2.\n\nThe static loads will be applied at the center of gravity of major com\xc2\xad\n119\n\nponents to simulate the "g" loads during flight maneuvering. At the same time, nor\xc2\xad\nmal loads will be applied to simulate thrust vectoring. In addition to the measurement\nof deflections in the engine casing, the engine will be rotated at low speed to demon\xc2\xad\nstrate rub free engine operation under a simulated 10 "g" static loading with vectored\nthrust.\n\n\nEngine/Nozzle Ground Checkout Test. All three engine/exhaust nozzle sets will\ncomplete a 5-10 hour preflight test before being delivered to NASA. These tests will\nbe run at the G.E. Edwards Flight Test Center to demonstrate the following items:\n*\t\n\nThe structural integrity of the engine/nozzle during dry and augmented\noperation.\n* \t The integration and operation of the exhaust nozzle actuator system and\ncontrols.\n* The effectiveness of the nozzle cooling system.\nUpon the successful completion of the preflight tests, the engine/nozzle sets will\nbe given a comprehensive visual inspection.\nDelivery of Hardware. Following ground checkout, the three engine/nozzle\nhardware sets will be shipped intact to NASA Lewis for altitude chamber testing. Each\nengine/nozzle assembly will remain intact for the remainder of the program unless\nthe \tneed for major repairs or overhaul arises. This will minimize changes in\noperating characteristics, thereby providing flight test data of greateraccuracy than\nwould be attainable if engines and nozzles were interchanged.\nNASA/LeRC Calibration Test. NASA Lewis will conduct calibration tests of\neach engine/nozzle assembly in an altitude test chamber. Thrust, inlet weight flow,\nfuel flow, ambient pressure, and engine/nozzle internal temperatures and pressures\nwill all be measured over a wide range of engine operating conditions in the test cham\xc2\xad\nber. During this test the effects of afterburner fuel distribution on surface tempera\xc2\xad\ntures will also be evaluated. General Electric will provide engineering support for the\ncalibration program to assist NASA with test planning, pretest predictions, on-site test\ncoverage to monitor performance and integrity of engine and nozzle hardware, and\ndata analysis to generate the required calibration curves. The test results will be\nused to update the YJ1O1 flight thrust calculation computer program to determine the \'\nihflight engine thrust based on the measured parameters. It will also adjust the\nthrust and fuel flow to a reference (Std) day condition. Fifteen to twenty hours total\ntesting is estimated for each engine nozzle assembly.\n120\n\nPrior to the engine/ADEN calibration tests, instrumentation checkout runs are\nrecommended where the engine is run with a reference (conic) nozzle to provide veri\xc2\xad\nfication that the instrumentation, data acquisition, and data reduction systems are work\xc2\xad\ning properly, and to provide an evaluation of the accuracy of thrust and flow measure\xc2\xad\nments.\n\nAn existing conic nozzle from previous ADEN test programs should be available\n\nfor the checkout runs.\nUtilization of the three-component thrust measurement stand used for previous\nYJ1O1/ADEN testing is planned, with modifications required to adapt the stand to the\nNASA Lewis facility before the scheduled test period.\nFollowing the NASA Lewis calibration tests, the YJ1o1/ADEN assemblies will\nbe ready for installation and checkout in the modified YF-17.\n\nAt this point, G. E. and\n\nNorthrop efforts will combine in a joint support program, reviewed in later sections.\nIn sections immediately following, the Northrop program leading up to the joint support\nphase will be reviewed.\n4. 2 Northrop YF-17 Airframe Modification Program\nAirframe Detail Design.\n\nAs shown in the milestone chart of Figure 85, Northrop\n\nis planning a ten month period to optimize and finalize the detailed designs for the\ncanard, forward fuselage modifications, shortened LEX, modified aft fuselage, modi\xc2\xad\nfied control system, and placement of flight test equipment and ballast.\nsideration in the detailed design will be emphasis on low cost.\n\nA prime con\xc2\xad\n\nEvery effort will be\n\nmade to utilize off-the-shelf and government furnished equipment wherever possible.\nThe detailed designs will also be oriented toward ease of restoration of the aircraft\nto its original configuration after the YF-17/ADEN flight test program.\n\nThe final pro\xc2\xad\n\nduct of the detail design effort will be manufacturing drawings suitable for fabrication\nand procurement of hardware.\nDevelopment Testing. As an initial part of the airframe detail design, the canard\ndesign will be refined and evaluated to thoroughly define the YF-17/canard flowfield\ncharacteristics and consequent altered aerodynamic performance.\n\nUsing an existing\n\n8% model of the YF-17 modified to incorporate the canards, a low speed test will be\nperformed in the Northrop 7 x 10 ft tunnel to refine the canard planform and to obtain\ninlet flowfield characteristics with the canard/short LEX configuration.\n\nThe finalized\n\nconfiguration will then be tested in a large scale government facility (tentatively AEDC)\nto obtain the transonic/supersonic performance characteristics.\n\n121\n\nI-I\n\nMONTHS FROM GO-AHEAD\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\nDETAIL DESIGN\n- FORWARD FUSELAGE\nMODIFICATION\n* REVISED SHORT LEX\n*CANARD\n\n\n*BALLAST\n\n\n*AFT FUSELAGE\nMODIFICATION\nDEVELOPMENT TESTING\n*CANARD LOW SPEED TEST\n* CANARD HIGH SPEED TEST\n\n\n-CANARD FLUTTER TEST\n\n\n*CONTROL SYSTEM BUILDUP\n\n\n& CHECKOUT\nFLIGHT PERFORMANCE\nMETHODOLOGY\n\n\nYF-17 HARDWARE\nDEVELOPMENT\n\n\n* FABRICATION & DETAIL\n\n\nASSEMBLY\n\n\n\n*AIRFRAME MODIFICATION\nENGINE INSTALLATION &\nCHECKOUT\n\n\nFLIGHT TEST\n\nFIGURE 85. NORTHROP YF-17 AIRFRAME MODIFICATION PROGRAM SCHEDULE\n\n42\n\nThe canard design will also be tested for structural integrity. A static test will\nbe run on the full-sized canard to 110% of the design critical loading condition. Wind\ntunnel flutter tests will be run on two 0. 125 scale half-span models of the canard to\ndetermine the subsonic and transonic flutter characteristics.\nTesting is tentatively scheduled for August 1979 in the NASA Ames 9 x 7 tunnel\nto extend the aft end aerodynamic data base developed in the NASA Langley 16 ft.\ntunnel further into the supersonic regime.\n\nResults of the Langley and Ames testing\nwill provide a thorough description of the aerodynamic performance characteristics of\nthe F-i8/ADEN integration. Given the similarity of the F-17 and F-18 configurations,\nplus the extensive storehouse of aerodynamic data available on the YF-17 aircraft with\naxisymmetric nozzles, it is felt that sufficient information is available to predict\nthe YF-17/ADEN aft end aerodynamic characteristics without incurring the cost of\nadditional testing on a completely representative configuration.\nYF-17 Control System Detail Design and Testing.\n\nAs part of the Northrop detail\n\ndesign effort, the modified control laws will be finalized, and software required to im\xc2\xad\nplement the revised control system will be identified through use of the Northrop soft\xc2\xad\nware development facility.\n\nThe finalized system will be built upon the Northrop Ad\xc2\xad\n\nvanced Flight Controls Test Stand to fully establish the hardware requirements and to\nverify control system safety and performance.\n\nFurther flight simulator studies will\n\nbe performed to expand the preliminary simulator investigations of Section 2.3 in order\nto determine how the expanded control system capability might be best utilized during\nthe flight test phase.\nYF-17 ADEN Performance Prediction Methodology.\n\nThe final aerodynamic\n\nperformance predictions for the YF-17/ADEN will be used in conjunction with the modi\xc2\xad\nfied G. E. YJ1O1 engine cycle deck to assess overall aircraft performance during the\nflight test phase.\n\nIn order to do this, a drag bookkeeping system will be defined to\ninsure that Langley and Ames results defining the YF-17/ADEN throttle-dependent\nafterbody drag are properly integrated with baseline throttle-independent drag levels\ndetermined on the canard-modified 8% aerodynamic force model with sting-distorted\naft end.\n\nWhen the bookkeeping methodology has been established, predicted YF-17/\nADEN aerodynamic and engine cycle performance will be generated for the entire flight\ntest envelope.\nHardware Development.\n\nAfter the 10 month design period, Northrop efforts will\nconcentrate on modification of the YF-17 to accept the YJ1Oi/ADEN. The aircraft\nwill be bailed by the Navy to NASA and shipped to Northrop\'s Hawthorne facilities where\na 13 month period is planned for hardware fabrication and airframe modification.\n123\n\nOne shipset of modified hardware will be procured.\n\nThe overall airframe and\n\ncanard hardware requirements have been discussed thoroughly in the configuration\ndesign sections 1.4 and- 1. 5; -the reader is referred to these sections for the specifics\nof these requirements.\n\nEfforts will be made to employ existing tooling and fixtures\n\nwherever possible in the fabrication process.\n\nSoft tooling will be employed to fabri\xc2\xad\n\ncate new hardware that does not lend itself to existing tooling.\nFollowing modification the aircraft will be trucked to Edwards AFB for inte\xc2\xad\ngration of the YJ101/ADEN and joint G. E. /Northrop checkout of the YF-17/ADEN\nsystem over a 4 month period.\n4.3 G. E. /Northrop Hardware Integration and Preflight Checkout\nAs shown in the summary milestone chart of Figure 82, the calibrated G. E.\nYJ101/ADEN assemblies and the modified YF-17 airframe will be available at\nEdwards for the 4 month integration and checkout phase 23 months after program\ngo-ahead.\n\nUnder NASA direction, G.E. and Northrop engineering personnel will\n\ncoordinate the installation of the YJ101/ADENs into the YF-17 to insure proper\ninterfacing of the systems. Following installation, ground tests will be performed\nto verify that all systems are functioning satisfactorily as expected.\n\nA tie-down\n\nthrust calibration test.will be performed at Edwards AFB to verify the predicted\nstatic thrust characteristics of the YJ101/ADEN as installed in the YF-17.\nThe flight control system will be subjected to limit cycle and ground resonance\ntests.\n\nA weight and balance test will also be performed on the assembled aircraft\nsystem. When the YF-17/ADEN has been judged to be performing satisfactorily\naccording to ground checkout testing, the aircraft will be turned over to NASA Dryden\nfor the flight test phase.\n\n4.4 NASA DFRC/Northrop/G. E. Flight Test Phase\nProgram Support.\n\nAs noted previously, YF-17/ADEN flight testing is tentatively\n\nscheduled for one hour per week over a 12 month period.\n\nDuring this phase of the pro\xc2\xad\n\ngram, NASA Dryden will be responsible for flight test planning and prodedure as well\nas on-site maintenance of the flight test aircraft.\n\n124\n\nG.E. will provide an engine/nozzle system flight test engineer for on-site\ncoverage throughout the test program.\n\nIn addition, aeromechanical and controls en\xc2\xad\n\ngineers completely familiar with the YF-17/ADEN program will be on-call to provide\na total of up to 15 man months effort.\n\nThe on-call manpower will be utilized as\nneeded to support the flight test engineer with data analysis, exhaust system\ninspections, troubleshooting, and anticipation of potential problems with controls,\nengine, and nozzle performance/operations.\nNorthrop will provide full-time/on-site support in the person of a nozzle/\nafterbody engineer well-versed in the YF-17/ADEN program, and will have qualified\nengineering personnel familiar with the YF-17/ADEN modified structure, controls\nsystem, and aircraft aerodynamics on-call to provide troubleshooting and support\nas required for a projected total of 24 man-months.\nEngine Nozzle Inspection & Maintenance.\n\nPeriodic inspection of the augmentor/\n\nnozzle will be conducted by G. E. personnel at NASA Dryden to insure the structural\nintegrity of the hardware throughout the flight test program.\n\nThese inspections will\n\nbe made after the first and second flights, at the end of the first, second, and third\nmonths of operation, and every three months thereafter for a total of seven inspections.\nThe inspection will require a partial disassembly of the exhaust system and will in\xc2\xad\nclude a visual inspection of all hardware, including the actuation system, engine\nmounts, cooling linear slots, nozzle flaps, and VEER. Radiographic or dye pene\xc2\xad\ntrant inspection will be recommended for all hardware showing unusual changes or\ndistressed areas that could affect the performance or structural integrity of the\nnozzle.\n\nDamaged or defective parts will be either repaired or replaced.\n\nIn addition to the periodic inspections, selective maintenance of the nozzle will\nbe scheduled to include the lubrication of all nozzle bearings and sliding components\nas required.\nEngine maintenance procedures ordinarily require a periodic evaluation (P. E.)\nfor overhaul of each engine after 50 hours of operation; however, the program\npresented here is structured so that careful scheduling of ground checkout and flight\ntime on the three engines will fulfill the 50 hours of flight time required for the\nprogram while avoiding the need for a P. E. on any of the engines.\n\nThis allows a\n\nsignificant reduction in estimated cost for the G.E. portion of the overall program.\n\n125\n\nYF-17 Extended Flight Test Life - The YF-17 originally performed as the\nNorthrop prototype flight test aircraft for the lightweight fighter competition.\n\nAs such,\n\nit was. designed for a-normal -2000 hour life and initially cleared for 300 hours of flight\ntesting.\n\nAt the completion of the lightweight fighter competitibn, the aircraft had ex\xc2\xad\n\nceeded 300 hours of flight time. A complete safety evaluation of the aircraft was per\xc2\xad\nformed by Northrop at that point under the direction of the Navy, whereupon it was\nrecommended that the allowable life be extended to 600 hours.\nextension, subject to review in 100 hour increments.\n\nThe Navy granted the\n\nThe aircraft has currently been\n\ncleared to 400 hours, and based on that evaluation, no problems are anticipated in the\neventual fulfillment of the 50 hour YF-17/ADEN program.\n4.5 Program Cost\nThe overall program described above will be funded as separate contracts to G.E. and\nNorthrop.\n\nThe engine refurbishment will be funded as a separate NASA program and\n\nas such will not be directly chargeable to the YF-17/ADEN program.\nare provided here for reference, however.\n\nCost estimates\n\nAll costs quoted are in 1978 dollars.\n\nTable 8 shows the estimated cost breakdown for the G.

The time to\naccomplish the required modifications is estimated to be 27 months from go\xc2\xad\nahead, followed by a 12 month flight research program.\n* \t The cost to accomplish the modification and perform a flight research program\non the YF-17/ADEN/canard configuration, including refurbishment of three\nYJ101 engines, is estimated to be 15. 9 million dollars.\n\nThis price is signifi\xc2\xad\n\ncantly lower than estimates advanced for other 2-D technology manned flight\ndemonstrators.\n" \t The integration of the ADEN nozzle design into the .YF-17 aircraft produces\nnegligible thrust-minus-drag improvements over the already low drag dual\naxisymmetric design.\n\nThe minor thrust-minus-drag differences are not suffi\xc2\xad\n\ncient to offset the weight penalty of the ADEN nozzles, and as a result aircraft\nperformance, in terms of cruise range, acceleration, and climb performance,\nis reduced.\n* \t Analysis has established that the incorporation of the ADEN thrust vectoring\ncapability into the YF-17 with deflecting canards available will produce some\nmodest returns in terms of direct lift generation, aircraft pointing capability,\nand takeoff/landing ground roll reduction.\n\nA noteworthy increase in pitch control\n\nat low dynamic pressure is also available.\n\nIt should be recognized that the capa\xc2\xad\n\nbility offered with the ADEN and canard has been defined through analysis of\nseveral preconceived modes of aircraft operation and quantified according to\nclassical energy maneuverability parameters; it may eventually be discovered\nthat these new sources of lift production and attitude control may find their best\n129\n\napplication in as-yet-unconceived maneuvers and tactics, unavailable to conven\xc2\xad\ntional fighters, that will be discovered 6nly through manned flight investigation\non the modified. YF-17.\n* \t With the incorporation of a thrust reverser, the versatility of the aircraft during\ncombat maneuvering will be further enhanced, and the capability will exist for\nsignificantly reducing the landing roll distance.\n* \t Conclusions regarding IR and RCS characteristics are presented in Volume IUof\nthis report; for convenience it will be briefly stated here that the ADEN nozzle\nintegration should offer improved aircraft survivability against both IR and RCS\nthreats through a combination of signature reduction and aircraft maneuverability.\nThe IR analysis indicates that the total hot plume radiation is reduced, that the\nsignature is greatly reduced in most of the upper hemisphere, and that the lower\nhemisphere signature can be maintained equal to conventional axisymmetric\nnozzles with adequate cooling.\nA number of recommendations can be made with regard to follow-on effort in\nthis program:\n"\n\nIt is recommended that the YF-17/ADEN modification program be pursued. The\nprogram offers an excelent and economical opportunity to gain experience in the\npractical aspects of implementing 2-D nozzle technology, and will provide a\nunique manned flight research vehicle for the investigation and evaluation of\nexpanded maneuver capability, improvements in takeoff and Landing performance,\nand IR/RCS signature reductions available through the proposed modifications.\n\n" In settling on a final configuration, the canard-configured aircraft, although more\nexpensive, is recommended as the preferable design in that thrust vectoring\nSTOL benefits and in-flight thrust vectoring air combat tactics could be quantified\nat a relatively small increase in program cost\n* \t Incorporation of a thrust reverser into the ADEN design is also recommended\nfor the additional contribution it provides to combat maneuverability and land\xc2\xad\ning performance. In-flight reversing has long been a candidate for flight research.\n* \t During the development testing planned for the follow-on phase, attention should\nbe directed toward expansion of the canard-configured YF-17 aerodynamic data\n130\n\nbase such that the canard design can be better integrated into the existing YF-17\nconfiguration.\n* \t An area that appears to offer considerable potential for development of innovative\nconcepts is the design and application of the aircraft control system for expanded\nmaneuver capability.\n\nResults of this study have indicated a number of subjects\n\nthat should be considered for follow-on investigation; i. e., optimization of the\ncontrol system loops, feedbacks, and gains utilized in the thrust vectoring and\nreversing modes, wing lift cancellation to amplify pointing capability, and\npotential untrimmed transient aircraft maneuvers, to name several.\n* \t Pending go-ahead for the follow-on phase defined in Section 4, it is felt that some\nnear-term activity would be advisable to sustain investigative momentum in areas\nrelated to this program. In this way, a valuable lead-in is provided to the pro\xc2\xad\ngram of Section 4 while further strengthening the technical foundations upon which\nthe proposed modification plan will rest.\n\nSeveral subjects suggest themselves\n\nfor immediate follow-on investigation:\n* \t Expansion of the canard aerodynamic data base to optimize the canard\napproach on the YF-17/ADEN.\n* \t Further development and quantification of maneuver capability available\nwith thrust vectoring and canards; one-on-one simulation to determine\nhow it can be applied to combat tactics.\n* \t Optimization of the modified pitch control system.\n* \t Preliminary design of the block-and-turn thrust reverser concept;\nidentification of the aerodynamic effects of ADEN thrust reversing\nthrough testing on the 0: 10 scale F-18 model.\n\n131\n\nAPPENDIX A\nMETHOD FOR MODIFYING YF-17 PITCH CAS FOR ADEN AND CANARD\nThe objective of this analysis was to design control modes that would exercise\nthe potential degrees of freedom available with the addition of the Aden nozzle and\ncanard control to the YF-17.\n\nLift without rotation and rotation without lifting were the\n\nmajor degrees of freedom to be investigated.\nYF-17 mode" were to be designed.\nrather than a full.aircraft design.\nAerodynamics.\n\nIn addition, a drag mode and an "identical\n\nThe desire was to have a feasibility demonstration\n\nTwo flight conditions were analyzed.\n\nLinearized aero data at\n\n(30, 000 ft.) were utilized\nM = 0.

Olinger, Dryden Flight Research Center\nThis report covers the unclassified portion of the YF-17/ADEN study. The classified portion, which\ndeals with infra-red/radar cross-section (IR/RCS) data,,is reported in NASA CR-144883.\n16. \t Abstract\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the YF-17\naircraft as a candidate nonaxisymmetric nozzle flight demonstrator.\nThis report summarizes (1) configuration design modifications,\n(2) control system design, (3) flight performance assessment, and\n(4) program plan and cost.\nTwo aircraft configurations were studied. The first was\nmodified as required to install only the augmented deflector exhaust\nnozzle (ADEN). The second one added a canard installation to\ntake advantage of the full (up to 200) nozzle vectoring capability.\nResults indicated that: (1) the program is feasible and can be\naccomplished at reasonable cost and low risk; (2) installation\nof ADEN increases the aircraft weight by 600 kg (1325 ib);\n(3) the control system can be modified to accomplish direct lift,\npointing capability, variable static margin and deceleration modes of\noperation; (4) unvectored thrust-minus-drag is similar to the baseline\nYF-17; and (5) vectoring does not improve maneuvering performance.\nHowever, some potential benefits in direct lift, aircraft pointing,\nhandling at low dynamic pressure and takeoff/landing ground roll are\navailable. A 27 month program with 12 months of flight test is\nenvisioned, with the cost estimated to be $15.9 million for the\ncanard-equipped aircraft and $13.2 million for the version\nwithout canard.\nThe feasibility of adding a thrust reverser to the YF-17/ADEN\nwas also studied.\n17. \t Key Words (Suggested by Author(s)) \t\nPropulsion\nNonaxisymmetric nozzles\n\n\nAirframe integration\n\n\n\n19. \t Security Cassif (of this report)\nUnclassified\n\n18.
