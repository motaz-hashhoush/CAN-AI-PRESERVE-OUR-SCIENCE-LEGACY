Using the World Wide Web (WWW) as a shared space paradigm, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) presents users with images of a lunar colony. Each project has a wing of the colony and each wing has a conference room, library, laboratory, and mail station. In FY95, the VRC development team proved the feasibility of this shared space concept by building a prototype using a Netscape commerce server and several public domain programs. Successful demonstrations of the prototype resulted in approval for a second phase. Phase 2, documented by this report, will produce a seamlessly integrated environment by introducing new technologies such as Java and Adobe Web Links to replace less efficient interface software.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990042214, "id": "39915c39999c46d6ad19d1141baa821d", "publicationDate": "1998-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990042214.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990042214/downloads/19990042214.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990042214/downloads/19990042214.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990042214/downloads/19990042214.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
