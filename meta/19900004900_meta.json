This span-loading aircraft, or flying wing, is capable of carrying extremely large payloads and is expected to be in demand to replace the slow-moving cargo ships currently in use. The spanloader seeks to reduce empty weight by eliminating the aircraft fuselage. Disadvantages are the thickness of the cargo-containing wing, and resulting stability and control problems. The spanloader presented here has a small fuselage, low-aspect ratio wings, winglets, and uses six turbofan engines for propulsion. It will have a payload capacity of 300,000 pounds plus 30 first class passengers and 6 crew members. Its projected market is transportation of freight from Europe and the U.S.A. to countries in the Pacific Basin. Cost estimates support its economic feasibility.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900004900, "id": "748d0c8eeaca4ed1adfbf3160aa6ae56", "publicationDate": "1989-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900004900.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900004900/downloads/19900004900.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900004900/downloads/19900004900.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900004900/downloads/19900004900.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
