The dating is therefore independent of the biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic time scales. Estimated errors of the initiation dates of the volcanic episodes determined from the distributions of the radiometric ages are, approximately, + or - 4 percent. There were 11 distinct episodes during the past 250 million years. Sometimes appearing in pairs, the episodes have occurred quasi-periodically with a mean cycle time of 32 + or - 1 (estimated error of the mean) million years. The initiation dates of the episodes are close to the estimated dates of mass extinctions of marine organisms. Showers of impacting comets may be the cause.", "title": "Flood basalt volcanism during the past 250 million years", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T16:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880062526, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rampino, Michael R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies; New York University", "location": "NY, United States"}}, "id": "9cdfb0e2430e4278bb862037929cf39c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880062526, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stothers, Richard B."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies", "location": "New York, United States"}}, "id": "5254b109f6024405901588030cbb17df"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880062526, "publications": [{"volume": "241", "submissionId": 19880062526, "issn": "0036-8075", "id": "b5c6a1730bb645ddbbad4961ae8d91f5", "publicationName": "Science", "publicationDate": "1988-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
