Layers of Arctic haze were observed in both dry air and moist air. A research flight on March 31, 1983, crossed a previously undocumented Arctic aerosol front structure. Condensation nucleus concentrations of 450/cu cm within the polluted continental air mass south of the front decreased to 80/cu cm within the clean Arctic air north of the front. Aerosols above the Aitken size range decreased one order of magnitude in both number and mass across this same air mass boundary.", "title": "Aerosol distributions and an arctic aerosol front during AGASP - Norwegian Arctic", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840051492, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ratz, W.
