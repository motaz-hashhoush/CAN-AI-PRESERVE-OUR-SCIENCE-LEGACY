After a series of\r\naerobraking and propulsive maneuvers, the spacecraft has\r\nbeen in its sun-synchronous primary science orbit since\r\nSeptember 2006 performing both scientific and Mars\r\nprogrammatic support roles. In addition to MRO\u2019s scientific\r\ninvestigations of Mars, NASA has tasked MRO to provide\r\nreconnaissance of potential landing sites for ongoing and\r\nfuture Mars missions. This paper covers the mission design\r\nand analysis process to characterize MRO\u2019s landing site\r\ncoverage capability for all global locations, with special focus\r\non potential sites for future missions: Gale Crater, Mawrth\r\nVallis, and Noachis Human Exploration Zone.", "title": "Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Landing Site Reconnaissance Capability", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007773, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnston, M.
