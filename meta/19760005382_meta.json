The following requirements or aspects of diversification that must be studied were given: fuel mix and end use patterns for various alternative diversification plans, current status of diversification, advantages and disadvantages of diversification, constraints and criteria, diversification actions and their controls, and means for implementing the chosen diversification strategy. The following advantages resulting from diversification were described: competition, crisis-related situations, local energy production, decentralized plant locations, long range energy policy, and environmental overloads. The major criteria by which a diversification program should be judged, the major constraints affecting the approaches, and the road to diversification, were elaborated.", "title": "Diversification:  Far term (2000 -    )", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T13:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19760005382, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760005382, "id": "3b8716b000954a68adef37cf36d3f7d4", "publicationName": "ECASTAR:  Energy Conserv.
