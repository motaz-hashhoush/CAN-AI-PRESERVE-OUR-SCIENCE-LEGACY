b'September 1970\n\n\t\n\nBrief 70-10349\n\n.\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF\n\nH\n\nNASA Tech Briefs announce new technology derived from the U.S. space program. They are issued to encourage commercial\napplication. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical\nInformation, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Requests for individual copies or questions relating to the Tech Brief program may\nbe directed to the Technology Utilization Division, NASA, Code UT, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\nOpen-Celled Polyurethane Foam\nAn open-celled polyurethane foam has been developed with an 8.3 lb/ft 3 density, and a compressive\nstrength of 295 to 325 psi. The manufacturing of a\nfoam with both a high degree of open cells and\nstrength to withstand over 300 psi compressive load\n\n.\n\nThe general purpose of the rigid, open-cell polyurethane foam is its use as an insulation block. The opencell characteristic of the material allows cryopumping\nof gas from within the cell structure to a cold surface\nor sorbent material. This property permits elimination of gas conduction and convection that normally\noccur within the closed-cell foam.\nAs shown in the figure, the completed foam sections were machined on a lathe and cut with a band\nsaw as required. Both cutting methods produced\nexcellent results. The evaluation of test development\nsamples was accomplished using a vacuum pump,\nbell jar and Hg manometer. The open cell foam that\nresulted from this development program was very\nsuccessful.\n\nNote:\nFoam Insulating Block\n\nis considered a major improvement in foam development. Possessing these advantages over other known\nopen-celled polyurethane foams, the new foam may\nbe useful as a porous spacer in layered insulation and\nas an insulation material in vacuum tight systems.\nIt is expected that wherever rigid polyurethane foam\nis used in a vacuum tight system as an insulation\nmember, the open-cell foam can be evacuated, with\nresultant lower thermal conductivity than obtainable\nwith a closed-cell foam of the same density. Adjustment of the quantity of activator mixed with other\nsubstances to produce the foam can yield materials\nof variable compressive strength and density. The\nfoam may also have possible application as a filter\nelement in various industries.\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
