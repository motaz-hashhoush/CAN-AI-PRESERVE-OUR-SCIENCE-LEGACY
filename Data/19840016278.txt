Sohler\n\t\n\n/89*\n\nCTtMAMA DV\n\nAs Zlways, there exists a great demand for new and improved\nsensors. The requirements set for them are above all reliability,\ninsensitivity to interference by electrical fields and a reasonable\nprice. One of the most recent developments in this direction is the\nfiber optics sensor, a by-product of light guide technology. Meanwhile, ways have been found with which one can in this way measure\nall kinds of physical values, in some cases with extraordinarily\nhigh accuracy. This area has already become quite complex; this\npaper i s intended to provide a survey of the field.\n1.\t\n\nIntroduction\na\n\nThe significant progress in the manufacture of low attenuation\nglass fibers has made a decisive contribution to the development of\nfiber optics sensors [1]. A fiber optics sensor is an optical\n\n3 ^^\n\ndetector which is supplied with light through a glass fiber, and which\nconducts an optical signal, suitably coded according to the\nmeasured magnitude, to a detector, and thereby to signal processing\n\nII\n\nwith displays or regulators, this being done through another fiber\n(which under certain circumstances can be identical to the supply\n\nfiber) , (Figure 1) .\nIn this way, one exploits, for one thing, the advantages of \t\noptical signal transmission through glass fiber cables which are also\nmore and more being put to work in commercial transmission routes.\nk\n\nNumbers in the margin indicate foreign pagination.\n1\n\nI^\n\n\t\n\nr\n\nn\n4^\nORIGINAL PAGE 19\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\t\n\n.j\n\nThe insensitivity of optical transmission circuits to electromagnetic field interference and their isolation from electrical\npotentials have here the greatest significance for fiber optics sensors.\nIn addition, the use of an optical sensor makes possible the direct\nconversion of the measured magnitude into an optical signal without\na second electro-optical conversion as in the case of electronic\nsensors with optical signal transmission. Moreover, (fiber) optical\n\n}\n\nsensors open up new capabilities for measurement; in many cases\nthey can be more accurate, more rugged and cheaper than the usual\nelectronic sensors.\nThe term "fiber optics sensor" nevertheless does not describe\na completely unitary concept: The actual optical sensor (Figure 1)\ncan, for example, "externally" modulate, as a function of the measured\nmagnitude, the transmission in the supply fiber/signal fiber pathway;\nbut it can also be "internally" a part of a specially prepared\nfiber. While most of these sensors are made with multiwave fibers\n(multimode), there are also fiber optics measurement systems with\nsingle-wave (monomode) fibers--in general of complicated design.\nIn the latter, the phase location or the polarization state is\nchanged by the effect of the measured magnitude on the fiber, while,\nin the sensor with multimode fibers, the light amplitude (and\nthereby the intensity) is usually a function of the measured amplitude.\nThese two types of fiber optics sensors will be presented below, using\nsome %xamples.\n\nrn\n\nr--\t\nMeasured \t\nma gnitude\t\n\nr\n\n- --- - - \xe2\x80\x94\n=\nL_\t\nSensor \' _\n\n.;y_a,\t\n\nDisplays\n?\'Regulators\nComputer\n\n\' - ..-^,\t\nLight supply\n\nLamp\n\nFigure 1.

In most cases, here the "external" optical\nsensor varies the transmission in the supply fiber/signal fiber\npathway. A simple light barrier, the position of which is detected\nwith optical fibers, can thus be termed an optical sensor of\nthis type. It is utilized for position determination or for measurement of fill status.\nA reflecting membrane which hooks up the pressure - dependent\nlight from the supply fiber with the signal fiber is a. further example\n[2]. This kind of sensor, even with fiber bundles, still remains so\nsmall that, installed in a catheter, it makes possible pressure\t\n\n/90\n\nmeasurements within the living heart [3]. Fluid crystals [4]\nor semi-conductors [S] between the two fibers serve for temperature\ndetermination; thereby use is made of the fact that the arrangement\nof the fluid crystal and the spectral location of the band-edge\nabsorption of the semi-conductor are temperature dependent. Very\nsmall and sensitive sensors have then alreadv been manufactured;\na possible area of application is hyperthermal cancer therapy [6].\nA phosphor optically activated by UV light through the supply\nfiber can also be termed an "external" optical sensor. Its temperature-dependent luminescent radiation is conducted out through the \t\n\nj\n\nsignal fiber and analyzed to determine temperature [7]. A device with\nthis kind of a sensor is already commerciaily offered in the USA; the\nalmiost punctiform measuring with disappearing heat capacity makes\npossible quite a variety of applications.\n2.2 "Internal" fiber optics sensors\nThe actual optical sensor, in the case of this class, is a\nspecially treated segment of fiber between the supply and the signal\nfiber. It can be a "naked" fiber section (consisting of the fiber\n3\n\na\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 18\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n111\n\ncore only), the aperture of which, and hence the transmission, is\ndependent on the refraction index_ of the surrounding medium.\nSuch a sensor is suitable for the determination of the level of a\nliquid [8] and/or for the measurement of its refraction index\n(Figure 2) [9]. Another example is represented by a segment of\nfiber which is deformed by an external force. Thus are created\ncurvature losses (light decoupled from the fiber) which are a\nmeasure of the applied force (or pressure) [10]. Such a sensor\nalso makes possible indirectly very exact measurement of a displacement. In addition, there are fibers specially doped (for example\nwith ions of rare earths such as neodymium a.nd europium)whose\noptically activated luminescence and transmission are a measure\nof temperature [10].\n\nr\n20\n\n1 10\ny\nC\t\n\nReadine\naccuracy :2^\n\n5\t\n\nPefract. index! `2 Oechsl e deg.\n135\t\n0\t\n\n20\t\n\n40\t\n\n36\t\n6C\t\n\n80\t\n\n1.37\t\n100\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa23ei Refraction index\n120 \xc2\xb0Oecnsie\n\nFigure 2.

Fiber Optics Sensors with Monowave Fibers\nThis group of sensors, the sensitivity of which increases\nproportional to the length of the measurement fiber,has in recent\ntimes been further developed with particular intensity [111. In\nthis way measurement sensitivity has been enormously improved through\nthe employment of ever longer fibers, possibly due to their extremely\nlow attenuation up to < 1 dB/km. Many of these sensors (or sensor\nsystems) promise to become interesting with respect to their\nperformance and their price.\n3.1 Mach-Zehnder and Michelsk n Interferometers\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - With a fiber optics Mach-Zehnder interferometer (Figure 3),\ntemperature differences [121, changes in length [131 and pressure\ndifferences [121 can be detected with particular sensitivity as a\nphase difference between measurement and comparison fiber. For\nexample, a fiber optics hydrophone with long fibers attains such\na high sensitivity that one can measure "sea state zero", the frequency dependent background noise in underw,iter sonar technique [141.\nHere it is of great interest that, on account of the flexibility\nof quartz glass fiber, sensors and sensor systems with directional\n\t\ncharacteristics can be built.\n\n4\n\nBy means of a special "coating" of the fibers it is possible\nnot only to increase the sensitivity of pressure measurements [151;\nbut it also makes possible measurement of other magnitudes such\nas magnetic field and current which do not directly affect the\nphase position of the light in the quartz glass fiber (there is\nan exception in the case of large magnetic fields and special sensor\narrangements due to Faraday effect; see also Paragraph 3.4). For\nexample, the measurement fiber can be coated with a magnetostrictive\nmaterial (e.g., nickel) [161 which when in a magnetic field exercises\nforces on the fiber which then gives rise to changes in length and in\nrefractive index. The cot-responding phase change can be easily\nmeasured.

Design of a fiber optics Mach-Zehnder interferometer.\n,\nlength have been attained [171. Through the known relationship\nbetween magnetic field and current (e.g., in a coil), the current\nstrength can then be determined. The induced phase difference can\namount to up to 100 rad/A x meters of fiber length. Sensors have \t\n\n/91\n\nbeen manufactured with 10 cm long fibers which show a linear relationship beween sensor signal and current strength in the range\nbetween 0.5 pA and 5 mA [171.\nA further possibility for measuring current strength consists\nin the analysis of a corresponding change in temperature. For this,\nthe current is conducted directly to the measurement fiber by a\nJ\n\nmetal coating. The temperature change generated thereby again\nvaries the optical length of the measurement fiber,thus produces\na phase change proportional to the current strength. At 1 Hz\nsensitivities were achieved of 100 rad/A x meters of fiber length and\nat 100 Hz still 1 rad/A x meters fiber length [171.\nAll these measurement capabilities are also present with a fiber\noptics Michelson interferometer which operates with reflective fiber\nends (Figure Q). In many cases with this a simpler, more compact sensor\nis possible.\n\n6\n\nr^ f\n\n3.2 Sagnac_Interferomoter (fiber optics gyroscope)_\nOne of the most extensively developed fiber optics sensor\nsystems is a g y roscope which analyzes as a measurement value the angular-velocity-dependent phase difference between the oppositely\ndirected light waves in a fiber optics Sagnac interferometer\n[34,35]. The sensitivity of the gyroscope can be immensely\t\n\nr\n\nincreased by the use of longer fiber lengths on account of the\n\n)\n\nextremely small attenuation in modern quartz glass fibers.\nToday detection sensitivities have already been attained which\npermit measurement of the rotation of the earth. Despite these\nimpressive results, we are still a long way from the theoretically\npossible detection limit of the fiber optics gyroscope. Estimates\nhave shown that sensitivities of up to around 10 -30 /hr should be\npossible [20]. For this reason, the fiber optics gyroscope will\ncertainly soon start competing with the expensive mechanical\ngyroscope systems which are many times more costly.\n\n3.3 Wave-guide resonators\n\n\t\n\ni\n\nA special kind of interferometric measuring instrument is the\nfiber resonator %Figure 6) [21]. It semi-integrates both arms of\nthe interferometer into itself. It is possible, through the choice\nof the mirror reflectivity, to set in any desired condition between\n"two beam" and "multibeam" interference. In this way an increase in\nsensitivity can be achieved which roughly corresponds to the\nacuteness of the resonator (to about 100).\n3.4 Polarimetric sensors\nPolarimetric sensors form a further class of fiber optics\nsensors with monomode wave-guides. They can be also considered as\ninterferometers which unit both arms into a single fiber. The\nmeasurements are of the relative phase differences between the\n\n7\n\nOR\xe2\x96\xbaG1NAL\n\nPAGS 1,9\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\northagonally polarized components of the transmitted light. Thus,\nthe physical field to be measured must generate and/or modify a\nbirefringence in the fiber. Thereby, the sensitivity is normally\nconsiderably smaller than with the classical interferometer; but\nthe measurement with a single fiber permits the design of m , :ch simpler\nsensors, for example, for temperature [22] or pressure [23] measurement\n\nx.ar\n\nFotod ode\t\n\nPiezo Quarz\n\nReflecting\nM. as, fiber end\n\nLaser\t\n\nBeam\t\nsplatter\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nsurfaces\n\nMirror Objeahve\n\nComparison fiber\n\n^E\n1\n1\n0.5\n\nV 1000\n\n850\t\n\n700\t\n\nU\n0\t\n\n2\t\n\nl\t\n\npm 6\nQA - y\nq\n\nFigure 4.

For this, a long\nglass fiber is wound as a coil around a conductor carrying a\ncurrent. The rotation of the polarization plane is proportional to\nthe linear integral (^ H dr, and thereby to the current strength in \t\nthe enclosed conductor.

To be mentioned here are .:lberfiber couplers [26], fiber polarizers [27], fiber phase shifters [28],\npolarization stabilizer p [29] and birefringent fibers 1201. Alongside these of course are used the components already extensively\n\nh\n\ndeveloped in optical signal technology such as semi-conductor\ni\n\nlasers, luminescent diodes, fiber jacks, wave length multiplexers,\nfilters and detectors. Also, the components of the integrated\nt\n\noptics, which preferably have been developed as monomode structural\nelements, offer great potential for pirely opt-i cal or electrooptical signal processing. To be mentioned as an examp;c would be\nan integrated polarization regulator which can transfor;*I;in\narbitrary polarization condition of the light entering into any\nother polarization condition at emission [311. Pure integrated\noptical sensors have also already been manufactured; an example\nis the integrated optical spectrum analyzer for ver y, high resolution. spectroscopy [32].\nWith all of these coLiponents and with the multiplicity of\nconcepts for fiber optics sensors, a series of useful new measurement\ndevices can be expected in the foreseeable future. Fiber optics gyroscopes, hydrephones, transformers, and temperature sensor y already\nstand on the threshold of industrial use.
