AeroMACS development has progressed from\nrequirements definition through technology definition,\nprototype deployment and testing, and now into national and\ninternational standards development. The first prototype\nAeroMACS system has been deployed at the Cleveland\nHopkins International Airport (CLE) and the adjacent NASA\nGlenn Research Center (GRC). During the past three years,\nextensive technical testing has taken place to characterize the\nperformance of the AeroMACS prototype and provide\ntechnical support for the standards development process. The\ntesting has characterized AeroMACS link and network\nperformance over a variety of conditions for both fixed and\nmobile data transmission and has included basic system\nperformance testing and fixed and mobile applications testing.\nThis paper provides a summary of the AeroMACS\nperformance testing and the status of standardization activities\nthat the testing supports.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Aviation Administration\n(FAA) in conjunction with MITRE-CAASD began\ndeveloping the Airport Network and Location Equipment\n(ANLE) concept. In [2], ANLE is described as a \xe2\x80\x9chigh\nintegrity, \xe2\x80\x9csafety rated\xe2\x80\x9d wireless local area network (LAN)\nfor the airport area, combined with a connected grid of\nmultilateration sensors. The former would provide the\ncockpit with access to appropriate information via a highbandwidth internet-like connection. The latter would use\nthose same transmissions to derive 3-dimensional position\nof the terminal \xe2\x80\x93 position that could then be broadcast via\nthe same data link to provide all users with situational\nawareness on the airport surface.\nAdding simple\ntransmitters to other surface-movement vehicles would\nallow for the development of a high-fidelity complete\npicture of the airport surface environment.\xe2\x80\x9d ANLE was\nproposed for the under-utilized 5091-5150 MHz band,\nwhich was allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation\nservice (ARNS) for implementation of Microwave Landing\nSystem (MLS), but for which no MLS channels had yet\nbeen assigned. The 5091-5150 MHz band, also referred to\nas the MLS Extension Band, also contains an allocation to\nfixed-satellite service (FSS) for use by non-geostationary\n(non-GSO) mobile-satellite service (MSS) feeder uplinks.\nMITRE-CAASD performed initial analyses of the sharing\nof the MLS Extension Band between the MSS feeder links\nand the ANLE system as reported in [3], to validate the\nfeasibility of sharing this band between the two systems.\nThis supported the addition of an aeronautical mobile\n(route) service (AM(R)S) allocation to the MLS Extension\nBand that could support the ANLE system at the World\nRadiocommunication Conference (WRC) 2007. Analysis of\nthe compatibility between the airport surface wireless\nnetwork and MSS feeder links has continued in order to\nestablish the AeroMACS power transmission limits which\nwill ensure, including work by both MITRE-CAASD and\nNASA Glenn Research Center [4,5].\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.

INTRODUCTION\nWireless communications for airport surface safety critical\naviation applications has been considered since the late\n1990s. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) researched\nthe application of multi-carrier code division multiple access\nto enable an Advanced Airport Data Link (ADL) to fulfill\nthe communications requirements of the Advanced Surface\nMovement Guidance and Control System [1]. ADL aimed\nto provide data communications between air traffic\ncontrollers, airport authorities, and airline companies and\naircraft on the airport surface. The possible use of 5000-\n\nIn 2002, the NASA Glenn Research Center considered\npossible communications, navigation and surveillance\nrequirements for the airport surface in formulating a new\nresearch\nproject\neventually\ncalled\nSpace-Based\nTechnologies (SBT).\nAt the Second Integrated\nCommunications, Navigation and Surveillance (ICNS)\nConference in April 2002, the recommendation was made to\n\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.\nIEEEAC Paper # 2342 Final Version 2, updated 21 January 2013.\n\n1\n\nidentify and address research efforts where current work is\ninadequate or underfunded regarding integration of multiple\napplications on the ground, the CNS performance\nrequirements of integrated applications, and the data\nnetworking implications of this integration [6]. As a result,\nthe SBT Project included a major effort in airport surface\ncommunications.\n\nservice, testing was initiated to provide technical results\nupon which national and international standards for\nAeroMACS could be established. A description of the\nAeroMACS system development can be found in [12].\nDuring the past three years, extensive technical testing has\ntaken place to characterize the performance of the\nAeroMACS prototype and provide technical support for the\nstandards development process.\nThis testing has\ncharacterized AeroMACS link and network performance\nover a variety of conditions for both fixed and mobile data\ntransmission.\n\nThe SBT Project studied communications requirements on\nthe airport surface and potential system architectures\nthrough in-house and contracted efforts. The results of\nthese studies [7,8] helped establish the basis for what\nbecame the AeroMACS system.\nFurther studies by\nMITRE-CAASD [9] built upon the SBT Project\nrequirements studies and other analyses enabled the estimate\nof spectrum requirements supporting the MLS Extension\nBand AM(R)S spectrum allocation approved at WRC 2007.\n\nDuring 2012, the first two practical AeroMACS\ndemonstrations have taken place, demonstrating both the\nfixed and mobile aspects of AeroMACS.\nThe first\ndemonstration utilized a Boeing corporation 737 jet\nequipped with an AeroMACS antenna and subscriber\nstation, enabling the evaluation of the AeroMACS\nperformance in bringing safety critical flight information to\nthe cockpit. This event marked the first use of an aircraft\ninvolved in AeroMACS testing, augmenting previous\nmobile testing which utilized a ground vehicle offering\nspeeds and reception characteristics which differ greatly\nfrom the commercial aircraft.\n\nBy 2007, the FAA and Eurocontrol had completed a joint\nstudy called the Future Communications Study,\ninvestigating the future communications requirements for\naviation. Among many outputs, this study concluded that\nthe IEEE 802.16e standard was the preferred technology for\nan airport surface wireless communications network,\nthereby establishing an international consensus that enabled\nAeroMACS standardization to proceed.\n\nThe second demonstration involved the suitability of\nAeroMACS to transmit live safety critical data between\nfixed assets. Live radar data from an Airport Surveillance\nRadar model 9 (ASR-9) was transmitted from the ASR-9\nsite to the air traffic control tower at CLE. This was the first\ndemonstration of broadband transmission of live safety\ncritical data over AeroMACS, and has established the\npotential for AeroMACS to be applied to many airport fixed\nasset communications requirements.\n\nUnder the SBT Project, NASA Glenn Research Center\nentered into a cooperative agreement with Sensis\nCorporation which resulted in the establishment of what\neventually came to be known as the NASA-CLE CNS\ntestbed, located at the NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC)\nand adjacent Cleveland Hopkins international Airport\n(CLE). In this testbed, the feasibility of using wireless\ncommunications networks for integration of surface\nsurveillance was established by interconnecting several\nAirport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE-X) sensor\nunits and transmitting sensor data to a central processing\nstation [10]. Prior to the availability of IEEE 802.16e\nequipment, the surface wireless network was implemented\nusing 802.11 equipment operating in the MLS Extension\nBand.\n\nIn the following sections, the AeroMACS prototype as\ninstantiated in the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed is described,\nfollowed by a summary of AeroMACS performance testing.\nThe focus of the paper will be on describing the most recent\nAeroMACS testing results, including the Boeing 737\naircraft mobility testing and the fixed safety critical data\ntransmission testing.\nThe status of AeroMACS\nstandardization activities will also be provided.\n\nThe SBT Project also developed a measurement campaign\nto characterize the MLS Extension Band propagation\nchannel in the airport environment. Under a cooperative\nagreement with Ohio University, channel propagation\nmeasurements were made at several large, medium and\nsmall airports in the United States [11]. The test results\nenabled the development of path loss and airport channel\nmodels valid for the 5091-5150 MHz band that enabled the\ndevelopment of detailed simulations of 802.16e\nperformance for the airport surface application.\n\n2. AEROMACS TESTBED DESCRIPTION\nOne of the primary goals of the NASA-CLE CNS Testbed\nas initially established was to enable testing of the\ninterconnection of ASDE-X sensors via an airport surface\nwireless communications network [13].\nThe testbed\nincluded assets at three different airports, including CLE,\nCleveland Burke Lakefront Airport, and Lorain County\nRegional Airport to allow testing of wide area\nmultilateration, remotely staffed virtual air traffic control,\nassessment of 4D arrival and departure trajectories, and\nadvanced integrated surveillance. The installation of an\nASDE-X system for testing required the placement of eight\nmultilateration sensors at CLE in order to achieve full\n\nIn 2009, under a cooperative agreement with ITT-Exelis and\nwith funding provided by the FAA, the first AeroMACS\nprototype was established within the NASA-CLE CNS\nTestbed. With the availability of 802.16e equipment,\nincluding base stations and subscriber units, tuned to the\nMLS Extension band now allocated for the AeroMACS\n2\n\nFigure 1 \xe2\x80\x93 AeroMACS Prototype Testbed.\nairport surface coverage. The use of an initial IEEE 802.11\nwireless network enabled the fixed ASDE-X sensors to be\ninterconnected to the ASDE-X processor, allowing real-time\nairport surface surveillance to be established.\n\nThe AeroMACS testbed also includes a mobile element,\ncalled the Aeronautical Research Vehicle (ARV) as shown\nin Figure 2. The ARC consists of a ground vehicle fully\nequipped with a subscriber stations, test and measurement\nsystems, and video camera. The ARV enables testing of\nmany mobile aspects of AeroMACS without the cost and\ndifficulty of using aircraft. However the ARV is limited in\nterms of size, speed and access compared to an actual\naircraft, hence the testing described below was essential in\ndemonstrating\nAeroMACS\nperformance\nfor\nreal\naeronautical mobile applications.\n\nFigure 1 shows a diagram of the current AeroMACS\nprototype testbed.\nBefore the ASDE-X tests were\ncompleted, the prototype AeroMACS system was installed.\nThis system consisted of two base stations and fixed and\nmobile subscriber stations. The fixed subscriber stations\n(denoted by \xe2\x80\x9cSS\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 1) were placed coincident with\nthe ASDE-X sensors, allowing a final set of tests with the\nASDE-X system using the AeroMACS prototype instead of\nthe 802.11 network. These tests proved that AeroMACS\nprovided equivalent performance in support of the ASDE-X\nsystem. After these tests the ASDE-X test system was\nremoved, but the AeroMACS subscriber units remained at\nthe same locations.\nThe location of the two base stations (BS-1 and BS-2 in\nFigure 1) covers the majority of the airport surface of CLE.\nThe base stations communicate with subscriber stations that\nare within their coverage. They also communicate with\neach other through a microwave backhaul link. This\narrangement enables testing of handoffs between base\nstations that is required for mobile AeroMACS connectivity\nas well as for handling cases of temporary obstructions of\nfixed subscriber stations.\n\nFigure 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Aeronautical Research Vehicle (ARV) for\nAeroMACS Testing.\n\n3\n\n3. AEROMACS PROTOTYPE TESTING\n\nFor all of this testing, the AeroMACS prototype network\nparameters are as described in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe primary AeroMACS prototype testing took place\nduring 2010 and 2011 [14, 15]. With the configuration\ndescribed in the previous section, static testing of the\nAeroMACS network using the fixed subscriber stations has\nbeen ongoing since the establishment of AeroMACS\nequipment in 2009. However the mobility requirement for\nAeroMACS is the critical and most difficult one, hence the\nARV was used extensively for these tests. The ARV often\noperated around the perimeter of CLE so as not to interfere\nwith airport operations. Some critical testing also took place\non the airport taxiways and runways when no aircraft\noperations were taking place. These various areas allowed\nboth line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)\nbetween the base stations and the mobile subscriber station.\n\nTesting was performed for three mobile subscriber station\nantenna configurations: single antenna; two antennas\nseparated by one wavelength; and two antennas separated\nby 10 wavelengths.\nBase station transmit power was set to 25 mW, 50 mW or\n100 mW. The vehicle speed was set to 13 knots, 26 knots\nor 40 knots.\nIn general the AeroMACS mobility testing showed robust\nperformance, producing throughput rates ranging from\napproximately 0.5 to 4.5 Mbps, depending primarily on the\ndistance of the vehicle from the base station as well as\nLOS/NLOS condition. This performance was seen in the\nseveral airport surface test regions: Runways (low\nmultipath, high speed); Terminal areas (High multipath and\nLOS/NLOS)); and Service road (Long range, variable\nmultipath, LOS/NLOS).\n\nThe AeroMACS testing consisted of AeroMACS mobility\ntesting; testing of Multiple antenna configurations (multipleinput/multiple output, or MIMO) on the vehicle; and testing\nof vehicle speed effects.\n\nThe MIMO testing validated the use of use of MIMO for the\nsubscriber station receive antenna as it showed improved\nreceiver performance and lower base station transmit power\nrequirements, enabling deployment of additional airport\ninstallations while still remaining below the mobile satellite\nservice feeder link interference threshold.\n\nTable 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Base Station Parameters\nTransmit Power\nChannel Bandwidth\nMaximum Antenna Gain\nAntenna Beamwidth\nAntenna Mode\nMaximum Transmission Unit\nDownlink/Uplink ratio\nHybrid automatic repeat\nrequest (HARQ)\nAAA server\nPKMv2, EAP-TTLS security\nAES-128 air link encryption\n\n21 dBm maximum\n5 MHz\n15 dBi\n90\xc2\xb0 azimuth by 8\xc2\xb0\nelevation\n2x2 MIMO (2Rx, 2Tx)\nMatrix A, MRC\n1440 bytes\n60/40\nEnabled\nEnabled\nEnabled\nEnabled\n\nTable 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Mobile Subscriber Station Parameters\nTransmit Power\nMaximum Antenna Gain\nAntenna Beamwidth\nAntenna Mode\n\nAdaptable - 21 dBm\nmaximum\n8 dBi\nOmindirectional\non\nhorizon\n2x2 MIMO (2Rx, 1Tx)\n\nFigure 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Average Throughput Rate for the Service\nRoad Drive Test\nFigure 3 shows the results of the service road test. The\nMIMO configuration outperformed the single antenna case,\nand the two antenna 10 wavelength spacing outperformed\nthe one wavelength spacing. The one wavelength antenna\nspacing (2.3\xe2\x80\x9d, 5.9cm) performed the same as the single\nantenna case with reduced base station transmit power,\nverifying that the MIMO installation enables a reduction of\nbase station transmit power and potentially more airport\ninstallations.\n\nTable 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Common Base Station and Subscriber Station\nParameters\nModulation\n\nForward Error Correction\n\nAdaptive:\nQPSK,\nQAM-16,\nQAM-64\nAdaptive,\nCTC \xc2\xbd, 2/3, \xc2\xbe, 5/6\n\nThe measured data throughput as a function of vehicle\nvelocity showed negligible difference up to 40 kts velocity.\nAdditional velocity test results are presented in the next\nsection.\n4\n\nterminal and taxi areas and on Runway 24L (see Figure 1)\nas are appropriate for an aircraft using AeroMACS.\n\n4. MOBILE APPLICATION TESTING\nThe first mobile applications testing of AeroMACS was\nperformed using a Boeing 737-700 that was provided by\nBoeing from their corporate fleet.\nThese activities\nconstituted the first use of AeroMACS using an actual\naircraft, including use of an antenna designed for aircraft\nuse [14, 16]. The aircraft tests also differed from the ARV\ntesting by offering significantly greater antenna height\nplacement and vehicle velocities.\nThe activities\ndemonstrated the first two-way AeroMACS data link\nservice providing flight critical data.\n\nThe Boeing 737-700 performance characterization resulted\nin the collection of AeroMACS performance data enabling a\ncomparison with the baseline ARV test data.\nThis\ncomparison revealed that the Boeing737-700 installed\nAeroMACS system had performance characteristics similar\nto the results obtained during the ARC testing. Of interest\nare the aircraft taxi tests as a function of velocity. A small\nthroughput performance dependency with vehicle velocity\nwas measured as aircraft speeds increased above 40 kts.\nTable 4 shows the average throughput as a function of\nvelocity. Figure 5 shows the effects of vehicle velocity as\nthe aircraft travelled down Runway 24L. The effects of\nproximity to the base station are visible in this figure as\nwell, with the base station location approximately one-third\nof the distance from the northeast end of Runway 24 L (see\nFigure 1). These test results indicate that AeroMACS can\nachieve good performance up to 50 kts as required by\nAeroMACS Profile (see Section 6).\n\nThe aircraft was fitted with a Sensor Systems S65-5366-720\n5 GHz antenna, temporarily replacing the standard VHF\nblade antenna as shown in Figure 4. The ARV\xe2\x80\x99s subscriber\nunit, a prototype AeroMACS unit with external antenna\nleads was installed in the aircraft and connected to the 5GHz\nantenna. United Airlines provided hangar facilities for\nmaking the necessary onboard modifications.\n\nTable 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Average Throughput as a Function of Vehicle\nSpeed\nSpeed, kts\n40\n40\n60\n80\n\nVehicle\nARV\nBoeing 737\nBoeing 737\nBoeing 737\n\nAverage Throughput,\nMbps\n4.7\n4.8\n4.2\n3.9\n\nFigure 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Boeing 737-700 Aircraft Used for AeroMACS\nMobility Testing Showing Location of AeroMACS\nAntenna.\nThe AeroMACS subscriber station onboard the Boeing 737700 was configured to associate with base station sector 2-3\nof the base station located at the ARFF facility on the\neastern side of CLE (see Figure 1). The sector offers 60\ndegrees of LOS coverage to the north and south of the\nsectors 270 degree heading.\nTwo activities were performed using this configuration.\nThe first activity consisted of characterizing the\nperformance of AeroMACS onboard a Boeing 737-700 by\nrepeating a subset of the drive test scenarios previously\nconducted with the ARV for the AeroMACS baseline tests\ndescribed in the previous section. Tests were performed\nusing similar airport surface and runway routes at velocities\nup to 80 kts. The second activity further validated the\nperformance of AeroMACS by demonstrating the successful\nuse of safety critical aeronautical mobile applications using\nAeroMACS as the application data link. For both activities,\nthe aircraft remained on the ground in taxi mode in the gate,\n\nFigure 5 \xe2\x80\x93 Effects of Vehicle Velocity on Throughput\nfrom Runway 24L Taxi Tests.\nThe AeroMACS validation activity required a suitable air\ntraffic control or air traffic services application over\nAeroMACS to the Boeing 737-700 as it taxied across the\nairport surface.\nThis effectively demonstrated the\nperformance and feasibility of AeroMACS for safety critical\nmobility applications. The selection of an appropriate\napplication was influenced by operational continuity\n5\n\nconsiderations, including FAA plans to implement early\ndata communications capabilities over VDL Mode 2 as part\nof the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s DataComm Program. Other considerations\nincluded the maturity of the data link service definition, the\nservice availability (whether or not the service currently\nexists or can be suitably emulated), and hardware and\nsoftware integration considerations.\n\n1.44mbps interface to the Internet, had\nimpact upon the demonstration application.\n\nno negative\n\n5. SAFETY CRITICAL FIXED ASSET TESTING\nThe opportunity to test AeroMACS using an actual critical\nfixed application was presented when Cleveland FAA\ninitiated plans for the construction of a new Air Traffic\nControl Tower (ATCT) facility. The optimal location for\nconstruction of the new ATCT facility was determined to be\nin close proximity to the ASR-9 system. As a consequence\nof the new ATCT construction location, the existing radar\nsensor was scheduled for displacement to a location north of\nthe airport. To enable seamless air traffic operations, the\nFAA operates an existing surveillance facility until a new\nradar system is built, optimized and thoroughly tested. The\nscheduled change of surveillance systems at Cleveland\nairport gave rise to the opportunity for testing AeroMACS\nutilizing the radar system scheduled for removal. With the\napproval and cooperation from FAA CLE Radar System\nSupport Center (SSC), a plan was formulated to integrate\nAeroMACS into the communications infrastructure at\nCleveland airport, interface it with the surveillance system\nand subsystems and conduct testing.\n\nThe application chosen to validate the AeroMACS\ntechnology was a navAero T-1000 Electronic Flight Bag\n(EFB) system hosting a weather applications from WSI\nCorporation known as InFlight, capable of presenting\ncockpit staff with critical en-route meteorological data such\nas AIRMETs (Airmen\'s Meteorological information),\nSIGMETs (Significant Meteorological Information), and\nterminal conditions through Meteorological Aerodrome\nReports (METARS).\nFigure 6 illustrates WSI\'s EFB\nshowing a regional radar graphic with textual METARs\ninset for CLE.\n\nIn preparation for testing in a relevant environment,\ncommunications equipment was obtained to conduct initial\nequipment setup and testing at a NASA GRC laboratory.\nLaboratory equipment configuration and layout was\ndesigned to replicate surveillance communications\nrequirements at ASR-9 radar facilities.\nLaboratory\nequipment consisted of AeroMACS subscriber stations,\nCodex 3600 modems, Newbridge 3624 Channel bank\nsystems and media converter equipment. The scope of the\nlaboratory test was to configure modems and channel bank\nsystems to transport information at the correct data rates\nwhile adhering to communication protocols in use.\nAeroMACS uses Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\nProtocol (TCP/IP) for communications exchange. The\ncommunications interface in use by telecommunications\nequipment commonly use T1 or DS-0 levels (1.544Mbps).\nTo enable the exchange of information between the T1\nchannel bank system interface and IP interface provided by\nAeroMACS, a media converter system was used. The\nmedia converter unit was able to packetize T1 channels and\nprovide timing signals for end-to-end channel bank\noperation. In laboratory testing, the AeroMACS system was\nable to transport 24 channels of a T1 system. Error free\nend-to-end bit error rate tests were conducted and the\nlaboratory system configuration was successfully tested\nunder different data rate load configurations and with\ndifferent modem parameters.\n\nFigure 6 - A sample Weather screen showing radar (with\nimpending rain) and a current METAR for CLE.\nThe Inflight system typically consists of a stand-alone\nSIRIUS satellite radio receiver which utilizes a 100BaseT\nEthernet connection to interface the unit to an EFB or\nmultifunction display (MFD). The system is normally\nmeant to be used onboard an individual aircraft, however\nthe intended demonstration consisted of interfacing the\nsatellite receiver unit into the AeroMACS testbed and\nutilizing the wireless data link to provide "last mile"\nservices to the cockpit. Due to a satellite receiver failure, the\nconfiguration was further altered to utilize AeroMACS to\nconnect to WSI demonstration system connected to the\ninternet.\nWSI\'s InFlight EFB weather application caches the\npacketized information broadcast over the Sirius satellite\nsystem. For timely information, the entire system, from\nreceiver to EFB, should be on receiving broadcast updates.\nWith SIRIUS data rates confined to 64kbps and below, the\n4 Mbps average throughput of the AeroMACS system\'s\nwireless data link component to aircraft, or even the\n\nStarting in April of 2012, NASA and FAA personnel\nproceeded to install AeroMACS equipment at the ASR-9\nsurveillance facility and ATCT. The AeroMACS subscriber\nstation was deployed at the radar tower structure and the\nPower Over Ethernet (POE) system and Newbridge Channel\n6\n\nBank were installed in the radar building. The POE and\nAeroMACS SS were connected using Ethernet cabling. At\nthe ATCT, an AeroMACS subscriber station was installed\non top of the Mezzanine building and cabled to the FAA\nequipment room where the Newbridge Channel Bank and\nPOE where deployed. The wireless configuration utilized\nthe base station to connect the subscriber station deployed at\nthe ATCT and subscriber station deployed at ASR facility\nas shown in Figure 7. Although an actual National Airspace\nSystem deployment will not utilize a two-hop configuration,\nthe NASA test bed AeroMACS prototype system did not\noffer a single hop architecture option. Bit error rate tests\nwere conducted employing loading and configurations used\nin the earlier laboratory tests, showing zero bit errors\ngenerated during the data transmission.\n\nevaluation of system latency under high communications\ndemand loading using shared services configuration. The\nfixed asset testing successfully demonstrated that\nAeroMACS is able to meet the requirements for\ntransporting critical surveillance data in a reliable and\nefficient way.\n\nFigure 8 \xe2\x80\x93 AeroMACS-ATCT-ASR-9 Interfaces\n\nFigure 7 \xe2\x80\x93 Wireless Configuration for ASR-9 Safety\nCritical Fixed Asset Tests.\nThe new surveillance system in Cleveland was\ncommissioned in July 2012, thus freeing up the old radar\nsystem for AeroMACS testing. At the ASR-9 location, the\nAeroMACS subscriber station was interfaced to the ASR-9\nRacal modem systems through the existing Data Probe\nswitching system. At the ATCT the AeroMACS subscriber\nstation was interfaced to the corresponding modem systems\nas shown in Figure 8. To monitor the performance of the\ncommunications system, a radar analysis tool (WRTADS)\nwas used to display and record system performance. The\nanalysis tool was deployed at both the ASR-9 and ATCT\nlocations. At the ASR-9 location, the radar analysis tool\nwas connected to the Communications Radar Interface Box\nwhere tracks produced by the radar system could be\nrecorded for post processing. At the ATCT, the radar\nanalysis tool was connected to the Serial Communications\nInterface Panel where received radar tracks were recorded\nfor post processing and comparison with recordings at the\nsensor location. The testing indicated that the AeroMACS\nsystem was successfully able to transport critical radar\ninformation from the radar source to the ATCT. Figure 9\nillustrates the performance of the voice grade line\nperformance. The loss performance from 400 Hz to 3000Hz\nis negligible and illustrates the signal quality being provided\nto the modem system.\n\nFigure 9 \xe2\x80\x93 AeroMACS-ASR-9 Test Voice Grade Line\nPerformance\n\n6. AEROMACS STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT\nWorldwide interoperability is a critical element in the\ndesign of AeroMACS technology. AeroMACS will be\nrequired to provide seamless worldwide communications\nservices while meeting the needs of many different users.\nCollaborative efforts to standardize AeroMACS are\n\nFuture AeroMACS evaluations will include testing of\nsystem performance utilizing a single hop wireless\nconfiguration.\nThis configuration would enable the\n7\n\nconcurrently taking place in the United States and Europe.\nIn the United States Radio Technical Commission for\nAeronautics (RTCA) Special Committee (SC) 223 is\nworking in the development of Minimum Operational\nPerformance Standards (MOPS) and the WiMAX Forum\nhas established a working group to address aviation\ninterests. In Europe standardization efforts are being\naccomplished through EUROCAE Working Group (WG)82 in developing MOPS and MASPS. The International\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working in the\ndevelopment of Standards and Recommended Practices\n(SARPS) and Concept of Operations (ConOps). Common\nAeroMACS standards development in the U.S. and Europe\nhas been requested by ICAO in response to the ANC-11\nrecommendation for global interoperability and to help\nexpedite ICAO approval of international AeroMACS\nstandards. The following sections provide information on\nongoing standardization efforts by these organizations.\n\nthe format of profiles developed by the WiMAX Forum\xc2\xae\nfor commercial and industrial use and is expected to be\nincorporated as one of several WiMAX Forum Certified\nprofiles. Airborne MOPS development started in 2011 and\nis scheduled to conclude in late 2012. MOPS objectives are\nto develop standards for both Airborne Component and\nGround Based base station components of AeroMACS.\nWiMAX Forum\nThe WiMAX Forum is an industry-led, not-for-profit\norganization that certifies and promotes the compatibility\nand interoperability of broadband wireless products based\nupon IEEE Standard 802.16. The WiMAX Forum has\ncreated the Aviation Working Group. The Working Group\nacts as a focal point for Worldwide Aviation Industry\ninterest in WIMAX as a technology for Aviation\nApplications, and promotes WiMAX as the premiere\ntechnology for Aviation Applications on a global basis. In\nAugust of 2010, an ad-hoc joint committee was formed\nbetween RTCA SC-223 and the WiMAX Forum to facilitate\ndevelopment of an AeroMACS profile.\nEUROCAE Working Group 82 (WG-82)\n\nRTCA Standards Development\nRTCA is an organization that through consensus develops\nCommunications, Navigation, Surveillance (CNS) and Air\nTraffic Management (ATM) recommended standards for the\nUnited States Aviation.\nIn 2009 a technology\nstandardization effort for AeroMACS to support future\nmobile and fixed data communication applications and\nservices for both ground/air and ground/ground\ncommunications services on the airport surface was\nproposed to RTCA\xe2\x80\x99s Project Management Committee\n(PMC). On the seventh of August 2009, RTCA PMC\napproved the Terms of Reference (TOR) document to\nproceed with AeroMACS standards development. The TOR\ndocument specified the delivery of the following products:\nAviation System Profiles for Airport Mobile Access\nCommunications Network and MOPS for Airport Surface\nWireless Mobile Access Communications Network.\n\nThe European Commission and EUROCONTROL have\nsponsored work projects under SESAR (Single European\nSky ATM Research) Joint Undertaking (SJU) to progress\nthe design and assessment of all future air/ground data link.\nEUROCAE assigned WG-82 to develop airport surface\nwireless communication standards in Europe. The group\nstarted in January 2010 with the purpose to develop the\nappropriate standards relative to new air-ground data link\ntechnologies including those associated with airport surface,\nand enroute/TMA using terrestrial and satellite\ncommunications (1). The working group is tasked with\ndelivering a total of four documents. The AeroMACS\nProfile and Airborne equipment MOPS documents are\njointly developed by RTCA and EUROCAE and the System\nlevel MASPS and Ground Equipment MOPS documents are\ndeveloped only by EUROCAE.\nEuropean WG-82\nstandardization support includes participation from\nEUROCONTROL, ANSPs (AENA, DSNA, DFS), Industry\n(INDRA, SELEXELSAG, THALES, SAAB, COBHAM,\nHITACHI) and Industry Forums (WMF). WG-82 is\nscheduled to deliver its document at the end of 2013.\n\nRTCA SC-223\nThe RTCA Special Committee on Airport Surface Wireless\nCommunications, SC-223, was established in August 2009\nto develop the AeroMACS profile and MOPS. With support\nfrom industry, government, EUROCONTROL and WG-82\nthe U.S. final draft profile was completed at the end of\n2010. The AeroMACS profile is a joint RTCA and\nEUROCAE development effort based on the WIMAX\ndocument, WiMAX Release 1 System Profile. This airport\nwireless communications technology has been developed\nbased on a specific WiMAX Forum profile of the IEEE\n802.16-2009 standard. Use of an established IEEE standard\nenables the aviation community to leverage extensive\ninternational standards collaboration and commercially\nprovided components and services. The profile document\nspecifies the use of selected 802.16-2009 technical\nparameters that best serve the aviation needs. Parameters\nhave been selected to meet mobile station requirements\nconsidering different users, varied environments and\noperational uses. The AeroMACS profile closely follows\n\nICAO SARPS\nICAO is a special agency of the United Nations responsible\nfor the adoption of standards and recommended practices\nconcerning air navigation. The development of Aviation\nStandards and Recommended Practices is done under the\ndirection of the Air Navigation Commission (ANC) through\nthe formal process of ICAO working group panels. The\nANC is the ICAO technical body. In March of 2012 the first\nAeronautical Communications Panel (ACP) Working Group\nS meeting convened in Montreal, Canada to commence\nstandardization of airport Wireless Communications. The\nTerms of Reference document for Working Group S defines\n8\n\nthe following objectives for the group:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Develop ICAO SARPs and Technical Manuals for\nAeroMACS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Define and describe AeroMACS security\nframework for worldwide interoperability.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AeroMACS addressing and discovery mechanism\nthat is consistent with ATN/IPS for global\ninteroperability while permits local implementation\nflexibility.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Coordination\nwith\ninternational\ntechnical\nstandardization bodies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide input to development of frequency\nplanning criteria.\n\na real weather application representative of safety critical\nservice application. A third set of tests demonstrated the\ntransmission of high rate safety critical radar data over\nAeroMACS. From these results, it can be concluded that\nthe performance of AeroMACS in supporting safety critical\naviation communications for both fixed and mobile\napplications will be sufficient to enable the deployment of\nAeroMACS. The standards required to support future\ndeployments and ensure international compatibility are\nadvancing toward completion.\nAlthough AeroMACS\ntesting and demonstration will continue while standards are\nfinalized, AeroMACS is poised for operational deployment\nin the near future.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAt the writing of this paper the development of SARP\ndocument outline is completed and work to define the\nstandard is progressing with support from different states\nand industry.

Requirements analyses\nprovided the airport surface communications spectrum\nrequirements, and interference and spectrum sharing studies\nproved the feasibility of adding an AM(R)S allocation to the\n5091-5150 MHz MLS Extension Band to accommodate the\nairport surface wireless communications system, which was\naccomplished at WRC 2007. The FAA-Eurocontrol Future\nCommunications Study verified that the IEEE 802.16e\nstandard is appropriate for the AeroMACS system. As this\nstandard supports the well-known WIMAX implementation,\nan aviation profile based on WIMAX has been developed by\nRTCA and EUROCAE, and the name AeroMACS has been\naccepted to refer to the emerging airport wireless\ncommunications\nnetwork.\nChannel\npropagation\nmeasurements have been performed at several airports,\nproviding data for the development of channel models used\nfor simulations of the AeroMACS profile. The availability\nin 2009 of IEEE 802.16e equipment tuned to the MLS\nExtension Band enabled the deployment of the first\nAeroMACS prototype as part of the NASA-CLE CNS\nTestbed located at the NASA Glenn Research Center and\nadjacent Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.\n\n[3] Gheorghisor, I., Hoh, Y.S., and Box, F., \xe2\x80\x9c\n5091-5150 MHz Bandsharing by Airport Wireless Local\nArea Networks and Satellite Feeder Links\xe2\x80\x9d, 25th Digital\nAvionics Systems Conference, October 2006.\n[4] Wilson, J.
