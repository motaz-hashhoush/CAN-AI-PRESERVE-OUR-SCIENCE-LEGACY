Given that the seismic data gathered on\nthe Moon over 40 years ago revolutionized our understanding of the Moon\nand are still being used today to produce new insight into the state of the\nlunar interior, it is no wonder that many future missions, both real and\nconceptual, plan to take seismometers to other planets.\nTo best facilitate the return of high-quality data from these instruments,\nas well as to further our understanding of the dynamic processes that modify\na planet\xe2\x80\x99s interior, various modeling approaches are used to quantify parameters such as the amount and distribution of seismicity, tidal deformation,\nand seismic structure on and of the terrestrial planets. In addition, recent\nadvances in wave\xef\xac\x81eld modeling have permitted a renewed look at seismic\nenergy transmission and the e\xe2\x86\xb5ects of attenuation and scattering, as well as\nthe presence and e\xe2\x86\xb5ect of a core, on recorded seismograms. In this chapter,\nwe will review these approaches.\n\n2\nSite selection for future planetary seismology\nmissions\n\nTypically, a minimum of three seismic stations is required for event location, and a fourth is required for depth determination. On Earth we take\nfor granted that any given event will be relatively well-located, due to the\ncomparative ease of installation of seismometers. For planetary applications,\nwe cannot count on a large distribution of stations. Various factors including\ncost, di culty of installation, instrumentation longevity, and data transmission severely limit the number of instruments that have been or will be\ndeployed on other planetary bodies. In this section, we will review various\nmethods that can be employed to help determine the best landing sites for\nfuture planetary seismology missions, in order to maximize their scienti\xef\xac\x81c\nreturn. We focus here on the Moon and Mars, although many of these methods are adaptable to other planetary bodies.\nKey issues that feed into the site selection of future seismometer deployments include: 1) Theoretically establishing the seismicity and noise environment of a planetary body, including tectonic, volcanic, arti\xef\xac\x81cial, and\nnatural impact sources; 2) Positioning of instruments relative to regions of\nexpected seismic sources to maximize the detectability of important seismic waves that traverse the interior, including body, surface, and normal\nmodes; and 3) Selection of landing sites and surface materials that maximize the longevity of a deployed instrument and minimize the seismic noise\nenvironment.\n2.1 The Moon\nThe installation of seismometers on the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s surface during the Apollo\nera provided a wealth of information that transformed our understanding\nof lunar formation and evolution. Seismic events detected by the nearside\nnetwork were used to constrain the structure of the Moon\xe2\x80\x99s crust and man-\n\n2.2 Mars\n\n3\n\ntle down to a depth of about 1000 km. However, the lack of seismic ray\npaths penetrating the deepest Moon prohibited de\xef\xac\x81nitive identi\xef\xac\x81cation of\nthe Moon\xe2\x80\x99s core.\nThe presence of an attenuating region in the deepest interior, generally interpreted as a core, has been inferred from the paucity of farside\nevents (Nakamura, 2005), as well as other indirect geophysical measurements (Wieczorek et al., 2006). In addition, more recent works have made\nprogress in the recognition of core-re\xef\xac\x82ected phases in the stacked Apollo\ndata (Weber et al., 2011; Garcia et al., 2011). Such phases typically arrive\nin the coda of the main P and S arrivals, hampering their identi\xef\xac\x81cation on\nindividual seismograms.\nBecause the presence of a lunar core has important implications for the\norigin and evolution of the Moon, future missions should focus on re\xef\xac\x81ning our\nknowledge of the deepest interior. Weber et al. (2010) devised a technique to\nmap ideal landing sites for the detection of core-interacting seismic phases\nfrom the known distribution of lunar seismic sources. The work focused on\nre\xef\xac\x82ected (PcP, ScS) and converted (PKP) phases, but is easily adaptable to\nany seismic phase.\nThe method takes into account the predicted ray density and arrival amplitudes (Figure 2.1), as well as the level of seismicity from the known distribution of deep moonquakes. An example for the PKP arrival is illustrated\nin Plate 1A, using the velocity model of Nakamura (1983) modi\xef\xac\x81ed to possess a core with radius 340 km and P-wave velocity of 5.0 km/s. At large\nepicentral distances, PKP is predicted as a \xef\xac\x81rst arrival, and hence should\nbe easily identi\xef\xac\x81able on future seismograms.\n\n2.2 Mars\nThe Viking landers of the late 1970\xe2\x80\x99s both carried a short-period threecomponent seismometer. On the Viking I lander, the un-caging mechanism\nfailed to unlock the instrument. Viking II landed in Utopia Planitia and\nreturned about 19 months of data (Lazarewicz et al., 1981); unfortunately\nbecause the seismometer was not coupled to the ground, it recorded only\nwind events (Anderson et al., 1977). Since Viking, several studies aimed to\nestimate the amount of seismicity that can be expected on Mars, in order\nto optimize future seismic experiments.\nIn general, three questions need to be answered to model a planets seismic\nactivity:\n1. How much deformation occurs in the lithosphere?\n\n4\n\nSite selection for future planetary seismology missions\n\nFigure 2.1 (left) Cross-section of the Moon showing the PKP ray fan for a\nsource depth of 900 km. (right) Predicted arrival amplitudes for a number\nof seismic phases, including core-interacting phases. The dots show actual\nApollo moonquake amplitudes. Note that core-re\xef\xac\x82ected phases fall below\nthe Apollo detection threshold. At large epicentral distances PKP is theoretically detectable by the Apollo seismometers, but such source-receiver\ngeometries were lacking given the limited near-site extent of the array.\n\n2. How does it translate into seismic events?\n3. Where do these occur?\nPhilips (1991) analyzed several possible sources of deformation of the martian lithosphere. As no plate tectonics occur today on Mars, secular cooling\nof the planetary interior is the most important source of deformation, with\nan estimated annual seismic moment release of 4.8 \xe2\x87\xa5 1018 Nm, whereas tidal\nstresses can be neglected. Analyses of the accumulated slip visible on the\nmartian surface today (Golombek et al., 1992; Golombek, 2002) yield moment release estimates of 1017 Nm and 1019 Nm per year.\nKnapmeyer et al. (2006) investigated not only the total amount of moment\nrelease, but also its distribution among individual events and the distribution\nof these events over the planet. Their model is thus not only able to link\nthe seismicity to geodynamic parameters but also able to produce synthetic\nevent catalogs for the evaluation of seismic experiment concepts.\nThe model consists of three main parts. The annual moment release due\nto cooling of the lithosphere is \xef\xac\x81rst estimated. Then the moment-frequency\nrelation (Gutenberg-Richter distribution) is modeled as a truncated pareto\ndistribution, giving the number N of events that exceed a seismic moment\n\n2.2 Mars\n\n5\n\nM0 . Finally, the seismic moment of an individual event is linked to the\nmap length of the fault on which it occurred, by following the assumption\nthat the stress drop is essentially constant for all quakes (e.g. Kanamori\nand Anderson, 1975). Knapmeyer et al. (2006) then mapped visible faults\non the martian surface to distribute the individual event sizes according to\nthe chosen distribution on faults that are long enough to produce them, i.e.\nsmall events may occur on almost any fault while large ones are restricted\nto the longest faults (Plate 1B).\nFive scenarios were named to refer to the annual moment release (strong or\nweak) and the number of events (many or few) resulting from the GutenbergRichter distribution, with an average model that evenly distributed both\nfactors. Translated into end-member magnitudes, the model suggests that\nthe shortest fault (L = 4 km) can produce events with magnitudes up to\nM0 = 4.7, while on the longest one (L = 1445 km), a M0 = 9.6 event is\npossible. In other words, the whole annual budget of the weak/few scenario\nmay be released in a single event on each of the mapped faults, while there\nis no severe restriction for the largest possible event from the size of tectonic\nfeatures. The recurrence times for quakes of di\xe2\x86\xb5erent size, according to the\n\xef\xac\x81ve model scenarios, are given in Table 2.1.\nThis seismicity model and the epicenter distributions derived from the\nmapped faults rely on a number of assumptions that may or may not be\nful\xef\xac\x81lled. The amount of lithospheric contraction considered is based on a\nnumerical simulation of the cooling of the lithosphere alone. Cooling of the\nentire mantle, the core, as well as a possible freezing of an inner core may\nmodify the radius changes. The model for the distribution of events on the\nmartian surface assumes that only the visible faults exist, and especially the\npossibility of deep sources is neglected. The latter is based on the assumption\nthat deep quakes such as those that occur on subduction zones on Earth cannot occur in the absence of plate tectonics, and that the state of the martian\nmantle makes very deep sources similar to the lunar deep quakes impossible.\nThe model by construction assumes that a strongest possible quake exists.\nThe magnitude of this can of course be set to very high values. However, one\nmust not confuse the annual seismic moment budget with the strongest possible event: the largest events observed on Earth release a seismic moment\nseveral times higher than the average annual release. Finally, the possibility\nof seismicity linked to volcanic activity is neglected: volcanism is a mechanism to cool the planetary interior, so active volcanism would change the\ncooling rates, and related events would occur near volcanic centers. These\ntwo e\xe2\x86\xb5ects were ignored because the current rate of martian volcanism ap-\n\n6\n\nSite selection for future planetary seismology missions\n\npears to be too low to be of signi\xef\xac\x81cance for a seismic experiment in the near\nfuture.\nIn addition to tectonic seismic events, impacts can also be used to study\nthe interior of planets, and are expected to be relatively common on airless\nor thin atmospheric bodies throughout the Solar System. For the Moon,\nover 1700 impacts were recorded by the Apollo seismic array, translating\nto approximately one impact/day. Recent high resolution imaging of fresh\ncraters on the surface estimates a similar cratering rate will be present on\nMars (Daubar et al., 2013).\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n7.6\n\nMag.

Therefore, many standard processing\ntechniques used in terrestrial seismology will be ine\xe2\x86\xb5ective for planetary\napplications. Specialized techniques are needed to analyze data from any\nfuture extraterrestrial seismic networks or single-station installations.\n3.1 Event location by P-S di\xe2\x86\xb5erential time and back-azimuth\nFuture seismic missions to the Moon can take advantage of the known locations and depths of the deep moonquake clusters detected by Apollo, which\nare presumably still active today. Future instrumentation will record seismograms from these sources on N stations, and the P and S arrival times\nt(P ) and t(S) from each station will result in N \xe2\x87\xa5 2 unique observations. For\na given event, we expect that with modern instrumentation we can measure\nt(S) t(P ) with an accuracy of 5 seconds, back azimuth with an accuracy\nof 10 degrees, and the di\xe2\x86\xb5erence between the P arrivals at di\xe2\x86\xb5erent stations\nwith an accuracy of 1 second. With this information, we can map the clusters\nthat can be uniquely identi\xef\xac\x81ed using N desired landing sites. An example\nis shown in Figure 3.1 for N = 2.\nMost of the clusters can be uniquely identi\xef\xac\x81ed with the S P time difference and back azimuth. However, the remaining clusters can possibly be\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed by including consideration of the temporal distribution of their\noccurrence times relative to the tidal cycle. All clusters could be identi\xef\xac\x81ed\nuniquely with four or \xef\xac\x81ve stations in reasonable network geometry, simply\nby location. It is important to note that the number of unique identi\xef\xac\x81cations\nstrongly depends on the positions of the stations relative to the clusters. Future landing sites should be chosen carefully to take advantage of established\nseismicity.\n\n3.2 Event location via timing of surface wave orbits\n\n9\n\nFigure 3.1 Number of neighbors with which a given deep moonquake cluster can potentially be confused. A large number of clusters can be uniquely\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed using information from only two recording stations (diamonds).\nThis number increases as the number of seismic stations increases.\n\n3.2 Event location via timing of surface wave orbits\nWith a su ciently large event where multiple orbit surface waves are recorded,\nepicentral distance and origin time can be determined at a single station\nwithout any requirement for an a priori velocity model. In the traditional\nsurface wave numbering scheme, orbits are numbered such that the Rayleigh\nwave propagating along the minor arc is numbered R1, the wave propagating along the major arc is R2, and the wave that propagates along the minor\narc with a complete great-circle orbit is numbered R3. If we \xef\xac\x81lter data containing multiple orbit surface waves using a series of narrow band \xef\xac\x81lters,\nand then measure the times of the R1, R2, and R3 peaks on the waveform envelopes, we can determine the great-circle averaged group velocity\ndispersion, epicentral distance, and event origin time using simple geometry.\nFor terrestrial data, we need events of approximately magnitude 6 in or-\n\n10\n\nSparse network or single-station seismology approaches\n\nder to reliably observe the weakest arrival, R3, but this approach can be\nextended to smaller events for smaller planetary bodies. Mars, for example,\nhas a radius approximately half that of the Earth, and therefore R3 would\nbe expected to be about an order of magnitude larger in amplitude simply due to geometric e\xe2\x86\xb5ects. A planet without an ocean would also likely\nhave lower background seismic noise than the Earth (where the microseismic\nbackground noise is generated via ocean processes), and so multiple orbit\nsurface waves will likely be measurable for magnitude 5 events on Mars with\na high quality broadband seismometer, and possibly to lower magnitudes.\nThis epicentral distance observation can be made independently in multiple\nfrequency bands, which allows for some estimates of the error.\nProvided the surface waves are adequately recorded on the horizontal\ncomponents, we can also determine back azimuth using the elliptical particle motion of the Rayleigh wave by correlating rotated horizontal components with the Hilbert transform of the vertical component. Using such an\napproach with terrestrial data between magnitude 6 and 6.5, epicentral distance was constrained within a degree, and origin time within 30 seconds for\nmost events, despite some biases due to un-modeled 3D structure (Figure\n3.2). While such location errors would be large for the purposes of state-ofthe art terrestrial seismology, initial tests show that they are adequate for\nperforming velocity inversions using small numbers of P and S body wave\npicks, and resolve mantle velocity structure within 5%. Finally, the group\nvelocity dispersion measurements included in this approach can then also\nbe used to constrain shallow mantle structure using traditional surface wave\ndispersion modeling. This shallow structure then can allow better location\nof smaller events using S and P di\xe2\x86\xb5erential times as discussed previously.\n3.3 Deep structure via normal mode analysis\nFor situations in which there is only a single deployed seismometer, another\ne\xe2\x86\xb5ective technique for studying deep structure is to use normal mode frequencies, which do not require knowledge of the source location. The periods\nof free oscillations of a planet are relevant to its structure. In particular the\nstate of the core a\xe2\x86\xb5ects the fundamental modes of free oscillation, with the\ngravest spheroidal mode (0 S2 ) being the most sensitive.\nSpectral peaks that are sensitive to mantle structure (520 mHz) can be\ndetected at a noise threshold level of 10 9 m/s2 /Hz1/2 , well within the capabilities of modern broadband seismometers being developed for planetary\nmissions (Lognonne et al., 1996). A single large quake can excite a planet\xe2\x80\x99s\nnormal modes, or multiple quakes with an equivalent cumulative seismic\n\n3.4 Location capability for future lunar seismic networks\n\n11\n\n8\n\nCount\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\xe2\x88\x921.2 \xe2\x88\x920.6 0.0\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.8\n\nDistance error (degrees)\n\n2.4 \xe2\x88\x9260\n\n\xe2\x88\x9240\n\n\xe2\x88\x9220\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nOrigin time error (s)\n\nFigure 3.2 Histograms of epicentral distance errors (left) and origin time\nerrors (right) for 29 events between magnitude 6.0 and 6.5 recorded at\nBFO in Germany, located by picking R1 R3 arrival times. Positive errors\nrepresent distances that are too large, or origin times that are too late,\nrespectively (Panning et al.; 2012).\n\nmoment can be stacked. Single-seismogram analysis requires a quake with\nseismic moment 1018 Nm, equivalent to a body wave magnitude mb \xe2\x87\xa0 6.\nKhan and Mosegaard (2001) attempted to investigate lunar normal modes\nusing Apollo seismic data recorded from large surface impacts, in order to\nconstrain seismic velocities and densities in the deep lunar interior. Their\nobservations were limited to the period during which the instruments were\noperated in \xe2\x80\x9c\xef\xac\x82at\xe2\x80\x9d mode, i.e. response extended to low frequencies; only \xef\xac\x81ve\nevents during this time were large enough. Su ciently large events on Mars\nare similarly predicted to be rare, with less than one event per year likely\n(Golombek et al., 1992; Knapmeyer et al., 2006); future seismic missions\nmust rely on longevity to detect them.\n\n3.4 Location capability for future lunar seismic networks\nThe traditional method for quake location converges towards the best-\xef\xac\x81t\nquake origin by minimizing the squared mis\xef\xac\x81t between observed and theoretical travel times. This method assumes that arrival time readings are\nGaussian-distributed. This assumption is problematic for data from sparse\nnetworks; a lack of redundancy means arrival time readings with large errors\nare more likely to be included in the solution.\n\n12\n\nSparse network or single-station seismology approaches\n\nThe LOCSMITH event location scheme (Knapmeyer et al., 2008) was\ndeveloped for sparse seismic networks on planets other than Earth. Rather\nthan solving for a best-\xef\xac\x81t location, it divides the solution set into falsi\xef\xac\x81ed and\nnon-falsi\xef\xac\x81ed candidate locations using an adaptive grid search, and accounts\nfor arrival time uncertainty using windows around the true arrival time. The\niterative algorithm starts with an icosahedral grid over all depths of the\nplanet, re\xef\xac\x81ning the grid size on each iteration.\nHempel et al. (2012) applied the LOCSMITH algorithm to the Apollo seismic data. For a candidate set of grid points and detecting stations, theoretical travel times were calculated via ray-tracing using several di\xe2\x86\xb5erent known\nlunar seismic velocity models. The travel times were then compared with observed arrival time windows for both compressional wave (P) and shear wave\nphases (S). The only assumption was that the chosen time window certainly\ncontains the searched arrival, which is adequate for moonquakes given that\nthe \xef\xac\x81rst arrivals are often emergent rather than impulsive.\nIf the gridded theoretical arrival times were found to lie within the arrival\ntime windows for all stations and all phases, the grid point density around\nthe corresponding grid point was re\xef\xac\x81ned for the next iteration. If not, the\ngrid point was considered falsi\xef\xac\x81ed. The solution sets of this algorithm are\ntherefore clouds composed of all non-falsi\xef\xac\x81ed grid points. The cloud size and\nshape depends on the number of observed arrivals. The best located clusters\nhave ball-shaped clouds that are similar to traditional quake location error\nellipses. Less well-located clusters have elongated clouds that resemble cones\nor bananas. The worst located clusters can only be constrained to disks that\nslice through the entire Moon.\nThis correlation between cloud shape and location uncertainty can be used\nto map the detection capability of future lunar seismic networks, assuming\nthe known deep moonquake clusters are still active (and we have no reason not to expect them to be). Plates 1C and 1D shows the global location\ncapability of an Apollo-like network, using a uniform distribution of 10,000\nsynthetic events. For a relatively small-aperture near side array consisting\nof Apollo-era instruments (Plate 1C), only events occurring in the vicinity of the network will be well-located (ball-shaped uncertainty clouds). For\na globally-distributed network consisting of modern state-of-the-art instruments (10 times more sensitive than Apollo), there is a dramatic improvement in the location capability (Plate 1D).\n\n4\nExploring the relationship between lunar seismicity\nand tidal forcing\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 4.5.1.5, deep moonquakes are known to occur periodically, with monthly (tidal) periodicity. To analyze the relationship between lunar seismicity and tidal forcing, several previous studies created\nmodels of the tidal stress \xef\xac\x81eld within the Moon. Solid-body tides are caused\nby the gravitational in\xef\xac\x82uence of the Earth, resulting in the deformation of\nthe Moon such that moonquakes are caused or triggered in the deep interior.\nIn studies of tidal forcing, a key constraint is the focal mechanism: the fault\nparameters describing the type of failure moonquakes represent. Knowledge\nof the failure plane allows us to resolve the tidal stress into its shear and normal components and evaluate the state of stress at the observed moonquake\noccurrence times. The normal stress resolved onto an arbitrary fault plane\ncalculated at the A6 deep moonquake source is shown in Figure 4.1. A6\nmoonquakes appear to occur at or near local minima in the normal stress,\nsuggesting a relationship between moonquake occurrence and unloading on\nthe fault.\nIn terrestrial seismology, the Coulomb stress criterion predicts failure\nwhen a linear combination of the shear and normal stress on a fault reaches\nsome critical value. Weber et al. (2009) attempted to apply a similar criterion to deep moonquakes by searching for a fault orientation such that\nmoonquakes occurred when a linear combination of shear and normal stress\non that fault reached a constant threshold. The results of their attempt for\nthe A1 source are shown in Figure 4.2. Fault orientations were searched in\n10 increments of dip and strike. The linear combination C of normal and\nshear stress was computed on each fault plane such that the variance of the\nratio between C computed at moonquake times and C computed on 1-day\nintervals was minimized. The absolute minimum of this variance ratio over\nall grid spaces was selected as the preferred fault plane.\nThis method worked better for some clusters than others, with a deep\n\n14\n\nExploring the relationship between lunar seismicity and tidal forcing\nnormal stress at A6 moonquake source\n-0.04\n\n(dip, strike) = (60\xc2\xb0,130\xc2\xb0)\n\n-0.06\n-0.08\n-0.10\n-0.12\n-0.14\n-0.16\n-0.18\n1970\n\n1972\n\n1974\n\n1976\n\n1978\n\n\xce\xb4 (degrees)\n\nFigure 4.1 Normal tidal stress calculated at the A6 source location, on\na fault with a dip of 60 and a strike of 130 deg, over the course of the\nApollo experiment.

For others, the de\xef\xac\x81nition of the best\xef\xac\x81t plane was more ambiguous, with a relatively shallow minimum, or several\nnearby minima in the strike-dip grid space. Since deep moonquake failure\nplanes have no surface expression, there is no way to visually verify whether\nthe best-\xef\xac\x81t plane is truly representative of the physical failure mechanism.\nIn addition, the quality of the lunar seismic data combined with the limited\nsource/receiver geometries of the Apollo network prohibit the determina-\n\nExploring the relationship between lunar seismicity and tidal forcing\n\n15\n\ntion of deep moonquake fault parameters using \xef\xac\x81rst-motion polarities, as is\ntypically done in terrestrial seismology.\nAn alternative method for focal mechanism recovery examined the extent to which shear (S) and compression (P) wave amplitude ratios can\nconstrain moonquake fault geometry by determining whether, for a given\ncluster, there exists a focal mechanism that can produce a radiation pattern\nconsistent with the amplitudes measured by the Apollo instruments (Weber\net al., 2012). Amplitudes were read in the ray coordinate frame, directly\nfrom seismograms for which the P and S arrivals were clearly identi\xef\xac\x81able\non all long-period channels of the four Apollo stations. An empirical station\ncorrection accounted for site e\xe2\x86\xb5ects at the four Apollo stations, as well as\nthe di\xe2\x86\xb5erences between P- and S-wave attenuation in the lunar interior.\nInstead of focusing on the best \xef\xac\x81tting solution only (as in Weber et al.,\n2009), the inverse problem was formulated using a falsi\xef\xac\x81cation criterion: all\nsource orientations that do not reproduce the observed S/P amplitude ratios\nwithin an error margin derived from the uncertainty of the amplitude readings were rejected. All others were accepted as possible solutions. Similarly\nto the Weber et al. (2009) method, the inversion was carried out using a grid\nsearch with prede\xef\xac\x81ned step size, encompassing all possible combinations of\nfault strike and dip, but also included slip (the direction of fault motion\nbetween strike and dip).\nSince the de\xef\xac\x81nition of a cluster implies that all events share the same\nsource orientation, a combination of the inversion results of all events from\none cluster reduces ambiguities in the inversion. Using only amplitude information, the fault plane parameter space for a given cluster was reduced\non average by half (Plate 1E).\n\n5\nSeismic wave\xef\xac\x81eld modeling\n\nLunar seismograms di\xe2\x86\xb5er greatly from terrestrial seismograms. The low attenuation of seismic energy combined with the highly scattering environment\nin the shallow subsurface results in recordings that are emergent rather than\nimpulsive, with long ringing coda that obscure all but the primary seismic\nphases. For this reason, it is useful to attempt to better understand the\ntransmission of seismic energy within the Moon through wave\xef\xac\x81eld modeling.\nIn this section we will discuss di\xe2\x86\xb5erent methods for synthetic seismogram\ngeneration, that are useful both for comparison with existing seismograms\n(the Moon) or for the prediction of seismic signals that might be recorded\non other planets (Mars; Europa).\n5.1 Normal mode seismology\nComplete wave\xef\xac\x81elds can be predicted e ciently using summation of normal modes calculated with a priori models of planetary structure. Such an\napproach is not well-suited for high frequency data, as the computations become more expensive and unstable for high frequencies and it is not trivial\nto include the e\xe2\x86\xb5ects of scattering and 3D structure, but they are extremely\nuseful when predicting long period responses. Such calculations can be used\nin advance of particular planetary missions in order to explore likely candidate seismic signals for discriminating between models of planetary interiors.\nFor Europa, a moon of Jupiter, Cammarano et al. (2006) produced a\nrange of possible thermodynamically consistent interior models by varying\nassumptions of initial chemistry, importance of tidal heating, and thickness\nof the ice shell overlying the likely global liquid water ocean (e.g. Kivelson et al., 2000). Panning et al. (2006) used these to create normal mode\ncatalogs complete up to periods of 10 seconds. By analyzing synthetic seismograms from mode summation, it was determined that long period signals\n\n5.2 Re\xef\xac\x82ectivity and full wave\xef\xac\x81eld methods\n\n17\n\nfrom internal events analogous to deep lunar events would be unlikely to be\nrecorded at the surface, but fracturing events in the ice shell would likely\nproduce very strong signals with characteristics strongly dependent on the\nthickness of the ice shell. In the frequency band between 1 and 100 mHz, the\nfundamental mode Rayleigh wave undergoes a transition from a nearly nondispersive wave at high frequencies, to a strongly dispersed \xef\xac\x82exural wave at\nlower frequencies. This \xef\xac\x82exural wave, also observed in terrestrial sea ice at\nhigher frequencies (Press and Ewing, 1951), has a characteristic dispersion\nwith phase velocity proportional to the square root of frequency, and group\nvelocity equal to double the phase velocity. The transition between the nondispersive Rayleigh wave and the \xef\xac\x82exural mode leads to a distinctive peak\nin group velocity at a frequency which depends on the thickness of the ice\nshell. This peak means that identi\xef\xac\x81cation of a surface wave-train, even in\nthe absence of event location, should be able to determine ice shell thickness\nsimply by determining the frequency of the \xef\xac\x81rst-arriving Rayleigh energy.\n5.2 Re\xef\xac\x82ectivity and full wave\xef\xac\x81eld methods\nSeismic energy transmission in the Moon is governed not only by the very low\nattenuation of waves in the surface zone, but also the intense scattering and\nreverberation of waves in the low-velocity lunar megaregolith and regolith.\nThese lowered seismic velocities are similar to those observed near impact\ncraters on Earth, and are related to a high amount of pore space and fracture\ndensity lowering the rigidity and compressibility of impact brecciated materials (Figure 5.1a). Here we discuss methods to reproduce the long duration\nand pronounced coda observed in lunar seismic signals, and implications for\nseismic structure of planets/objects with surface megaregolith layers.\nHigh frequency (>1Hz) synthetic wave propagation techniques are essential for properly replicating long duration codas that relate to scattering\nand reverberation of seismic energy within the megaregolith, which normal\nmode methods don\xe2\x80\x99t capture. Reverberations and trapping of seismic energy\nin a low-velocity wave channel can be achieved with a variety of 1-D wave\npropagation codes, but scattering requires a much more computationally expensive 3-D wave\xef\xac\x81eld simulation, which has only recently become available.\nBelow are two examples of how high frequency wave propagation methods\ncan be used to investigate the e\xe2\x86\xb5ects of low-velocity surface wave guides and\nscattering in planetary surface materials.\nPropagation of waves within the low-velocity surface materials can be\napproximated using a variety of 1-D seismic wave propagation codes. Typically these models allow speci\xef\xac\x81cation of a layer-cake planet and are ef-\n\n18\n\nSeismic wave\xef\xac\x81eld modeling\n\nFigure 5.1 Seismic structure of the lunar crust and megaregolith. A) The\ncrustal velocity model after Weber et al., (2011), showing the geology of\nthe subsurface. The megaregolith extends from the surface to just above\nthe structurally disturbed crust. B) 1-D wave propagation for a model with\na 1 km thick layer of low-velocity megaregolith showing the development\nof surface waves and reverberations trapped in the layer.\n\n\xef\xac\x81ciently run on modern CPUs at frequencies of \xe2\x87\xa01 Hz. One example is\nGEMINI (Green\xe2\x80\x99s function of the Earth by MInor Integration), made available through the SPICE (Seismic wave Propagation and Imaging in Complex media: a European network) project. It solves the equations of motion\nfor seismic source(s) and convolves the result with the Green\xe2\x80\x99s coe cients\ncalculated for layered 1-D media. Source functions can be either empirically\nde\xef\xac\x81ned or from a standard set of basic source types. The code produces seismograms for anisotropic and anelastic media for any 1-D layer-cake model\nstructure; responses are calculated for a user-de\xef\xac\x81ned set of stations at dominant frequencies up to 10 Hz. From 1-D simulations (Figure 5.1b) we can see\nthat surface waves and multiple reverberations become trapped in the low\nvelocities of the lunar megaregolith, serving as a waveguide for energy transmitted into this layer. This simulates the long duration of codas but does not\nfully replicate the scattering properties observed in the lunar megaregolith.\nTo properly address scattering, a high frequency, 3-D wave propagation\ncode, such as WPP (Wave Propagation Program) is required (Petersson\nand Sjogreen, 2010). WPP solves the equation of motion on a 3-D \xef\xac\x81nite\ndi\xe2\x86\xb5erence, non-uniform Cartesian mesh, and is designed to run on parallel\nmulti-CPU clusters. The user may specify elastic structures in 3D, including\ntopography, layering, lateral heterogeneity, attenuation, and multiple sources\nwith varying source time functions. The code is primarily used for regional\nsimulations of wave propagation in complex media, the elastic response of\n\n5.2 Re\xef\xac\x82ectivity and full wave\xef\xac\x81eld methods\n\n19\n\nthe medium is calculated for dominant frequencies up to 10 Hz or greater,\nthough computational resources required grow for higher frequencies.\nIn Figure 5.2, we demonstrate the e\xe2\x86\xb5ect of scattering in the megaregolith\nusing WPP to obtain lunar-like seismograms. By introducing a layer of\nscattering into the low-velocity megaregolith, several lunar-like wave\xef\xac\x81eld\nfeatures, including long duration codas, partitioning of energy on all three\ncomponents of motion, and di\xe2\x86\xb5use surface waves are reproduced. Additionally, body waves entering into the coda layer from below become scattered\nat the surface only. As computational resources grow, fully global simulations at high frequency are becoming available, allowing us to investigate\nthe global e\xe2\x86\xb5ects of scattering at very long distances. Scattering e\xe2\x86\xb5ects will\nvary from world to world, with airless bodies with well-developed megaregoliths (Moon, Mercury, asteroids) having the highest proportion of scattering within their crusts relative to bodies with atmospheres and intragranular\n\xef\xac\x82uids and ices (Mars, Earth, Venus, the outer satellites). WPP is appropriate\nfor any planetary object with a solid surface and can be used to approximate\nthe scattering from rocky and icy worlds.\n\n20\n\nSeismic wave\xef\xac\x81eld modeling\n\nFigure 5.2 Seismic scattering in the lunar crust and megaregolith for an\nimpact source.
