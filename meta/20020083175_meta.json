It was later used to cleanse swimming pools and has now been applied to industrial cooling towers and process coolers. Sensible Technologies, Inc. has added two other technologies to the system, which occupies only six square feet. It is manufactured in three capacities, and larger models are custom built on request. The system eliminates scale, corrosion, algae, bacteria and debris, and because of the NASA technology, viruses and waterborne bacteria are also destroyed. Applications include a General Motors cooling tower, amusement parks, ice manufacture and a closed-loop process cooling system.", "title": "Water Purification", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083175, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083175, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "7e2e3b57aaee4683b2c09de396bbe1db", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083175.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083175/downloads/20020083175.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083175/downloads/20020083175.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083175/downloads/20020083175.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
