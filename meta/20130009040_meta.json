She then takes her laptop out of its case and places it in a separate bin. As the items move through the x-ray machine, the woman waits for a sign from security personnel to pass through the metal detector. Today, she was lucky; she did not encounter any delays. The man behind her, however, was asked to step inside a large circular tube, raise his hands above his head, and have his whole body scanned. If you have ever witnessed a full-body scan at the airport, you may have witnessed terahertz imaging. Terahertz wavelengths are located between microwave and infrared on the electromagnetic spectrum. When exposed to these wavelengths, certain materials such as clothing, thin metal, sheet rock, and insulation become transparent. At airports, terahertz radiation can illuminate guns, knives, or explosives hidden underneath a passenger s clothing. At NASA s Kennedy Space Center, terahertz wavelengths have assisted in the inspection of materials like insulating foam on the external tanks of the now-retired space shuttle. \"The foam we used on the external tank was a little denser than Styrofoam, but not much,\" says Robert Youngquist, a physicist at Kennedy. The problem, he explains, was that \"we lost a space shuttle by having a chunk of foam fall off from the external fuel tank and hit the orbiter.\" To uncover any potential defects in the foam covering, such as voids or air pockets, that could keep the material from staying in place, NASA employed terahertz imaging to see through the foam. For many years, the technique ensured the integrity of the material on the external tanks.", "title": "Terahertz Lasers Reveal Information for 3D Images", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-27T11:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20130009040, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009040, "id": "22b7af36f7d944d386cfdac9852ad658", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2012", "publicationDate": "2013-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130009003, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130009040.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130009040/downloads/20130009040.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130009040/downloads/20130009040.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130009040/downloads/20130009040.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
