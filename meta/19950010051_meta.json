They are xv and pbmplus. The xv image viewer which runs under the X window system reads images in a number of different file formats and writes them out in different formats. The view area supports a pop-up control panel. The 'algorithms' menu lets you blur an image. The xv control panel also activates the color editor which displays the image's color map (if one exists). The xv image viewer is available through the internet. The pbmplus package is a set of tools designed to perform image processing from within a UNIX shell. The acronym 'pbm' stands for portable bit map. Like xv, the pbm plus tool can convert images from and to many different file formats. The source code and manual pages for pbmplus are also available through the internet.
