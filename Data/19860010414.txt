S.\nGovernment and another and may be manufactured and used by or for\ngovernmental purposes without the payment thereon or therefor.\nTechnical Field\nThis invention relates to surgical apparatus for disintegrating\nurinary calculi, and, more particularly, to a cutting head and to an\nultrasonic device for fragmenting or drilling through urinary calculi in\n5 situ.\nBackground Art\nThe incidence of hospitalization for the removal of urinary\ncalculi, commonly referred to as kidney stones, has been estimated to be\nas high as 200,000 cases per year. Stones which are quite small may in\n10 some cases be passed without hospitalization. However, in the\n. remainder, the kidney stones become impacted in the ureter, a muscle\ntube joining the kidney to the bladder. An impacted kidney stone is a\nsource of intense pain and bleeding, a source of infection, and, if the\nstone completely blocks the flow of urine for any extended length of\n15 time, can cause the loss of a kidney. Small stones which are lodged in\nthe lower third of the ureter can be removed non-surgically by using a\ntechnique employing the well known Dormia stone basket. However, basket\nremoval of a kidney stone usually fails if the stone is lodged in the\nupper ureter, is impacted, or is larger than one centimeter in diameter.\n20 In these cases, the only procedure by which the stone could heretofore\nbe removed was through a serious surgical operation called a\nureterolithotomy.\nMore recently, however, a non-surgical method for removing kidney\nstones has been developed. In this technique, the kidney stones are\n25 subject to a vibratory action, such as that provided by an\nultrasonically vibrated wire probe. In one such apparatus, a catheter\nis placed cystoscopically at the site of the stone in the urinary tract,\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n-\n\n25\n\n30\n\nafter which a long wire probe is passed through a lumen of the catheter\nand is brought into contact with the stone. The wire probe is attached\nto the ultrasonic transducer which, when energized, sets the wire probe\ninto lateral and longitudinal vibrations. The vibrational energy is\ntransmitted by the wire probe to the stone, causing it to fracture into\nsmall fragments which the patient can then pass spontaneously after\nwithdrawal of the catheter.\nWhile such apparatus can perform its intended function, a severe\nlimitation has been found to exist due to slippage of the thin wire\nprobe off the kidney stone and its lodgement between the stone and\nurinary tract. Attempts to ameliorate this situation by providing a\nwider tip cutting surface has resulted in premature breakage of the wire\nprobe at the tip exiting the catheter near the kidney stone. This\noccurs because the vibrational energy, typically 20 KHz in frequency, in\nconjunction with the added cantilevered mass of the larger cutting area,\ncauses the wire probe to snap off due to metal fatigue after 10-20\nseconds of operation. This has been found to be insufficient time\nto complete the disintegration procedure, as well as dangerous because\nit leaves metal fragments in the urinary tract. A clear need,\ntherefore, exists to prolong the operational life of the wire probe for\na length of tine adequate for completion of the procedure. A desirable\ntime frame is typically one minute, which is substantially greater than\nthat provided by known prior art apparatus.\nStatement of the Invention\nAccordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a cutting\nhead for surgical use.\nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a cutting\nhead member for an ultrasonically vibrated wire probe.\nA further object of the instant invention is to provide a safer and\nmore efficient cutting head for ultrasonically disintegrating kidney\nstones.\nStill another object of the invention is to provide an improved\nsystem for prolonging the operational life of an instrument for\ndisintegrating kidney stones.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nAnother further object of the present invention is to provide a\ndevice for seating of kidney stones within a cutting head in an\nultrasonic lithotripsy procedure.\nYet another object of the present invention is to greatly enhance\nthe fragmentation of kidney stones when using ultrasonic lithotripsy.\nThese and other objects of the present invention are provided by a\ncutting head which is attachable to the end of the ultrasonically\nvibrated wire probe. The cutting head includes a large diameter cutting\nsection provided with a plurality of teeth formed on the periphency of\none end thereof to present a cup-shaped receptacle to seat a kidney\nstone therein. The member also includes a collar integrally formed with\nthe cutting tip section to reduce stress points along the probe.\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\nThe foregoing, as well as other objects, features, and advantages\n15\nof the invention will become apparent from the following detailed\ndescription when taken in conjunction with the appended drawings in\nwhich like numbers represent the same or similar components throughout\nthe several drawings, and wherein:\nFigure 1 is a side elevational view of state-of-the-art apparatus\n20 - for fragmenting kidney stones;\nFigure 2 is a side elevational view of the cutting head of this\ninvention; and\nFigure 3 is a longitudinal view, partly in section, of the\ncutting head in contact with a kidney stone.\n25\n\n30\n\nDescription of the Preferred Embodiment\nReferring to the drawings, and, more particularly, to Figure 1,\nthere is illustrated an ultrasonic kidney stone disintegration\ninstrument in accordance with the prior art. The purpose of this Figure\nis to provide a better understanding of the invention to be described in\ndetail in conjunction with Figures 2 and 3.\nFigure 1 shows a cystoscope 10 inserted through a patient's urethra\n12 into a bladder 14. A catheter 16 is inserted through the cystoscope\n10, the baddder 14, and into a ureter 18 until its far end 20 comes into\nproximity to a piece of urinary calculi, hereinafter referred to as a\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nkidney stone, 22. A wire probe 24 is inserted through the catheter 16\nuntil its far end 26 contacts the stone 22. The diameter of the wire\nprobe 24 is substantially smaller than the lumen diameter of the\ncatheter 16 so that any movement of the wire probe is not restricted by\nthe catheter material.- The opposite, or near end, 28 of the wire probe\n24 is connected to the tip 30 of a movable ultrasonic transducer\nassembly 32 which is mounted on a base 34. The base 34 includes a\nhandle 36 having a trigger 37 which is connected to the transducer 32\nfor adjusting the position of the wire probe 24 against the stone 22 by\na linear translation of the transducer assembly 32 on the base 34. Base\n34 additionally includes an outward angular support member 38 which\nincludes a connector element in the form of a catheter joint 40 for\nengaging and holding the near end of the catheter 16. The terminal\nportion of the wire probe is clamped to tip 30 of the transducer 32 by\na set screw 42.\nWith the catheter 16 and wire probe 24 inserted into the ureter 18,\nend 26 of the probe is optically guided to make contact against kidney\nstone 22. Thereafter, the transducer assembly 32 is energized to\nprovide lateral motion to the wire probe 24 and the probe is gently\npushed against the stone.\nThis apparatus does not operate as desired when tip 26 of the wire\nprobe slips off the surface of the stone 22 and slides past it as\nillustrated in the dotted line position of tip 26'. In this\ncircumstance tip 26' does not perform its intended function. Increasing\nthe surface area of the cutting tip causes it to break off from the\nprobe 24 at end 20 of catheter 16, at the point of greatest stress where\nit emerges from the catheter.\nWith the foregoing in mind, a cutting tip 44 shown in Figures 2 and\n3 is attached to end 26 of the wire probe to overcome the problem of\nwire slippage and to greatly increase the cutting surface area. Tip\nmember 44 provides two structural features, one of which prevents\npremature breakage of the wire probe at the point of its exiting the\ncatheter 16, while the other assures seating of the kidney stone within\nthe tip member 44.\nMember 44 is of stainless steel construction and comprises two\nintegrally formed coaxial cylindrical sections, an elongate collar\nsection 46 which relieves stress, and a cutting tip section 48.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nMember 44 is also provided with a central circular opening (not\nshown) which extends completely through collar section 46 and through\nmost of cutting tip section 48. The opening has a diameter sufficiently\nwide so that it is just capable of being slid over wire tip 26. By\ninserting wire tip 26 through the opening as far as possible into the\ncutting tip section 48, the end of the cutting tip section is arranged\nto initially abut the kidney stone encountered. Member 44 is thereafter\ncompressed and swaged to the wire probe 24, such as at points 58 and 60\nof the cutting tip section 48, thereby ensuring its permanent retention\nthereon. Additionally, tip 26 can be undercut so as to present a\nrecessed surface, further enhancing the swaging procedure.\nCollar section 46, has an external diameter larger than that of\nprobe 24, but less than the inner diameter of catheter 16 and is of\nsufficient length to insure that it only partially extends out of the\ncatheter when it is in the operational mode, best illustrated in Figure 3.\nCutting tip section 48 has a slightly larger external diameter than\nthe external diameter of collar section 46 but less than the inner\ndiameter of ureter 18. It is provided with a plurality of cutting\nteeth, preferably between three and six. The cutting tip section 48 is\nillustrated in Figure 2 as having four teeth 50, 52, 54, and 56. Teeth\n50, 52, 54, and 56 are formed on the periphery of one end of the cutting\ntip section to provide a cup-shaped receptacle for seating a kidney\nstone 22. Teeth 50, 52, 54, and 56 are machined directly into the end\nof cutting tip section 48 and are desirably provided with flat ends so\nas to preclude the possibility of a pointed tooth surface frcm scraping\nthe urethra. While no specific configuration for the teeth is\nnecessary, it has been found that a suitable arrangement is one where\nthe teeth are equidistantly-spaoed, three-sided with one corner forming\nthe cup-shaped receptacle, and with a tapering cross section.\nWhile not intended to be limiting, the following approximate\ndimensions of the cutting head 44 are presented by way of example only:\nDiameter of cutting tip section 48\xe2\x80\x940.063 inches\nLength of cutting tip section 48\xe2\x80\x940.16 inches\nDiameter of collar section 46\xe2\x80\x940.045 inches\nLength of collar section 46\xe2\x80\x940.233 inches\n\nIn such a configuration, the member 44 attached to the wire probe 24\ntransmits maximum acoustic vibrational energy from the probe to the\nstone 22. The relatively large diameter of cutting tip section 48\nincreases the cutting surface area by a factor of three or more and\n5\ninsures maximum contact between wire and stone 22 as well as prevents\nslippage of the wire past the stone. The cup-shaped end of the tip 48\ninduces seating of the stone 22 on the cutting tip.\nThe four teeth 50, 52, 54, and 56 assure maximum fragmentation of\nthe stone 22. Even if the stone 22 is highly irregular in shape and\n10\ncentering of the tip 48 upon the stone is far from perfect, the stone\nwill fragment when contacted by any portion of the cutting tip.\nThe lifetime of the wire probe 24 is substantially increased by the\nprovision of an elongate collar 46 which partially stays within the\ncatheter 16 while the cutting tip section 48 is extended against the\n15\nstone 22. The collar 46 greatly lessens the mechanical bending loads\nand stress points imposed on the wire 24 by the vibrating mass of the\ncutting tip 48, because the root of the mass is within the catheter 16\nand not cantilevered away from it. Further, by joining the cutting tip\n48 to the wire 24 by a swaged joint 58, 60 rather than by soldering,\n20 - mechanical stresses and fatigue fractures are greatly lessened. The\nlife of the assembly has been found to exceed four minutes when\nvibrating at 20 KHz, thus providing ample time to complete the kidney\nstone disintegration procedure.\nHaving thus shown and described the invention in specific detail,\n25\nthe same has been provided by way of explanation and not limitation and\naccordingly all modifications, alterations and changes coming within the\nspirit and scope of the invention are herein meant to be included.\n\nCUTTING HEAD FOR ULTRASONIC LITHOTRIPSY\n\nABSTRACT\n\nA cutting head for attachment to the end of the wire probe of an\nultrasonic kidney stone disintegration instrument. The cutting head has\na plurality of circumferentially arranged teeth formed at one end\nthereof to provide a cup-shaped receptacle for kidney stones encountered\nduring the disintegration procedure. An integral reduced diameter\ncollar diminishes stress points in the wire and reduces breakage\nthereof.\n\n"
