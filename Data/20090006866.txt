A brief historical perspective is given to aerosol optical depth\n(AOD) measurements over the oceans. A short summary of thc existing data. collected\nonboard ships of opportunity during the NASA Sensor Inter-comparison and Mergcr for\nBiological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Project is presented.\nGlobally-averaged oceanic aerosol optical depth (derived from island-based AERONET\nmeasuren~ents) 500 nm is -0.1 1 and Angstrom parameter (computed within spcctral\nat\nrange 440-870 nm) is calculated to he -0.6.

MAN ship-bascd aerosol optical depth\ncompare well to simultaneous island and near-coastal AERONET site AOD,\n\nIntroduction.\nThe World Ocean produces a large amount of natural aerosols that have a11 impact on the\nEarth\'s albedo and climate. Sea-salt is the major contributor to aerosol optical depth over\nthe oceans\n\nmaho how alder ul. 2006; Chin et a/. 2002; Satheesh et a[. 1999; Winter and\n\nCi7j>lek,19971 and therefore affects the radiative balance over the ocean through the\ndirect [Haywoodet al. 19991 and indirect aerosol effect [O\'Dowdet a / . 19991. Aerosols\nover the oceans (produced marine and advected from land sources) arc important for\nvarious atmospheric processes [Lewis and Schuvartz, 20041 and remote sensing studies\n\n[Gordon, 19971.\n\nRecent publications emphasizing aerosol trends over the oceans based on the long-term\nsatcllitc records [Mishchenko er a/. 2007; Chylek et 01. 2007; Ren7er et (11. 20081 and the\n\nLitc et ul. [2004] in the global validation of two channel AVHRR aerosol optical depth\nretrievals.\n\nIn the current paper we present brief analysis of the historical SIMBIOS ship-borne and\nAERONET island-bascd aerosol optical depth data, describe the concept of MAN, and\nshow first results from the cruises contributing to the Maritime Aerosol Network.\n\nSlMBIOS data\nThe SIMBIOS (The Sensor Intercomparison for Marine Biological and Interdisciplinaly\nOcean Studies) program [Mzcellere/ a/. 1998; McClain and Fargion, 19991 began in\n1997 and through 2003 collected data on aerosol optical depth over the oceans from\nvarious ships of opportunity using Microtops I1 hand-held sunphotometers. Measurement\nstrategy and protocol, ship tracks, and statistics for various aerosol types and regions\nwere presented in the paper by Knobe2spie.sse rt al. [2004]. The SIMBIOS database was\nre-visited in order to bcttcr understand where we still have gaps in our knowlcdgc on\naerosol optical properties over the oceans. Daily averages were computed for all available\ncruises and after some additional screening data were divided into two subsets: oceanic\nand coastal (acquired within 100- 150 lim from the nearest shorelinc). Additional quality\ncontrol (screening) was typically minimal; however during one of thc cruises aerosol\noptical depth demonstrated a consistent unusual spectral dependence, which implied\ncalibration or instrumental problems. As a result these suspect data were removed from\nfurther consideration. Overall 458 measurement days spanning a 6 year period (1997-\n\nof Japan intensively studied during the ACE-Asia experiment, though within a limited\ntime frame (March-April 2001). Figure l b shows relatively stable optical conditions on\nthe West Coast with ~ " ( 5 0 0\nnm) less than 0.20 and a variety of aerosol loadings on the\nEast Coast where optical depth ranged from 0.05 to 0.60. Pollution and dust aerosol\ndominated aerosol optical properties during the ACE-Asia experiment and aerosol optical\ndepth in some instances was over 1.00. The latitudinal dependence shown in Fig. 1b\npresents a clear picture that despite the tremendous effort in data collection the gaps\ndominate and therefore suggests how little we know.\n\nAERONET data\nThe Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) is a world-wide network of sunisky\nradiometers that operates over 300 sites worldwide [Holhen et ul. 19981. Starting in 1996\nAERONET has a number of operational island sites. Several publications based on the\nAERONET data [Hulhen et ul. 2001 ; Eck et rrl. 2001; 2005; Smit-nov el ul. 2000,2002,\n2003a, 2003bl have analyzed aerosol optical properties over the oceans, including\npollution and dust aerosol transport affecting and modifying those properties.\nAccumulated statistics on aerosol optical depth and Angstrom parameter afforded\nestimation of the globally averaged parameters over the oceans (from island-based\nmeasurements). Yearly mean aerosol optical depth and Angstrom parameter for various\nisland sites are shown in Fig. 2 (a and b). Horizontal bars reprcsent plus or minus one\nstandard deviation. Locations of these AERONET sites are shown in Fig. 3, while Table\n1 presents coordinates, measurement period, and number of measurement days used in\n\nAsian dust transport [Eck et rrl. 20051. In fact when the spring (March through May) dust\ntransport months are excluded the remaining 9-month average at Midway -0.09. The\nAERONET rccord for the Atlantic shows a strong latitudinal dependence and optical\ndepth is highly variable. Homsund is located on Spitzbcrgen in the Arctic (77" N) and\nyearly average r,, there (-0.08, this is only for 7 months due to polar night) is very close\nto the remote marine conditions, despite the presence of Arctic haze (from advcctcd\npollutants) in the spring months [Shaw, 19951. Saharan dust transport strongly affects the\naerosol optical properties ovcr Cape Verde and Barbados. Industrial pollution can modify\nmaritime aerosol ovcr Bermuda and the Azores, Seasonal dust and biomass burning\naerosol transport frequently influences the Ascension Island optical depth. The record for\nthe Indian Ocean sites was not as long as for thc Pacific and Atlantic. Optical depth data\nover Kaashidhoo (Maldives) were collected primarily during the dry season when the\nnorthcast monsoon brought heavily polluted air from the Indian sub-continent. A modest\nrccord from other sites in the sub-tropical and mid-latitude Southern Indian Ocean\nyielded average r,, -0.05-0.08.\n\nWe computed globally averaged ~ , ( 5 0 0 and Angstrom parameter a (based on a\nnm)\nspectral range 440-870 nm; computed by log-linear rcgrcssion of 440, 500, 675 and 870\nnm data, except for a few instmtnents that lacked the 500 nm channcl) by simply\nweighting tltc mean optical parameter for a particular ocean with the area fraction of that\nocean basin (see Table 2). Data acquired over Homsund were considered representative\ne\nfor the Arctic Ocean and ship-bascd data reported by S~ninirnov t a / . [2006] were takcn as\n\nThe AERONET-based oceanic globally-averaged s,,(500 nm) 1s -0.11 (o-0.04); this\nvalue is very close to the satellite record reported by Remrr et a/.[2008] (0. I3 for Aqua\nand 0.14 for Terra), Zhang et ul. [2008] (0.12 for NAAPS with the assimilated MODIS\ndata), Mishhcl?enk e al. [2007] (0. I1 for AVHRR), Myhrr et al. [2005] (0.10-0.16 for\nt\nAVHRR, SeaWifs, MODIS), Zhuo e a/ [2005] (0.1 1-0.16 for AVHRR and MODIS).\nt\nCoarse particles of the marine sea-salt and continental dust aerosol reduced the Angstrom\nparameter (mean of -0.6) and made it lower by a factor of two compared to typical a\nvalues (-1.3-1.7) over cont~nental\nregtons that are not affected by desert dust (see c g\nHolben et al [2001]).\n\nMaritime Aerosol Network status\nAccurate knowledge of atmospheric aerosol optical properties is a key to the success of\natmospheric correction over the oceans. The NASA Workshop "Supporting in-situ and\nspace-based measurements" (Montreal, Quebec, October 6-7, 2006) helped to formulate\nscientific questions and research challenges needing to be addressed: current atmospheric\naerosol models should be updated and more data over the oceans should be collected.\nTherefore, the principal question of this workshop could be formulated as follows: what\nis to be done to Improve our knowledge of aerosol opttcal properttes over the oceans and\nfill the existing data gaps. We suggested the establishment of the Maritime Aerosol\nNetwork which would he a component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET),\nand would be affiliated with the AERONET calibration and data processing standards\nand procedures. The proposed activity evolved around hand-held sunphotometer\n\noptical depth in each channel docs not exceed plus or minus 0.02, which is slightly higher\nthan the uncertainty of the AERONET field (not master) instruments as shown by Eck et\nal. 119991. A GPS should be connected to the sunphotomcter to obtain the timc of\nmeasurements and geographical position of thc ship.\n\nEach Microtops instrument is calibrated against an AERONET master-CIMEL sunisky\nradiometer at GSFC, which was calibrated from morning Langlcy plot measurements on\nMauna Loa. As a rulc we put a master-CIMEL in a manual mode that enables it to take\ndirect sun mcasurernents every minutc. The Microtops then takes 20-30 consecutive\nscans within an approximately 5-6 minute interval, side-by-side with the master-CIMEL.\nIt is highly desirable to make inter-calibration measurements in clear (with AOD at 500\nnm less than 0.25) and stable atmospheric conditions to ensure accurate and stable\nresults. Figure 4 presents a calibration window that indicates that standard deviation of\nthe acrosol optical depth during the calibration process (based on the CIMEL\nmeasurements) is less than 0.005. Aerosol optical depths and their standard deviations are\nshown for the master-instrument (top) and calibrated Microtops (bottom) for a timc\nperiod of several minutes. New and old "extraterrestrial signal constants" are displayed\nwith variation coefficients (standard deviation/mcan; in %) for each spectral channcl. The\nlast column indicates the temporal change in calibration coefticients (in %). Aerosol\noptical depth is retrieved by applying the AERONET processing algorithm (Version 2) to\nthe raw data [Sivirlirrzov ei a[. 2004;\n!~tio:,:icroni.!.csfc.~nils~i.z!~~ I-,c h ~ ~ f o z u ~ n tvcrsi!>n2 1iliiic.17iit~].\nI>C\\V\niits\n\npolnts in the group); and a sequence of scrles in a day may be used to compute the daily\naverage.\n\nData quality is assured in the following way. The Level I .O (unscrecned) measurement\nseries are formed from Level 1.O points. The cloud and pointing error screening is applied\nto Level 1.0 data to producc a Level 1 .S data set. The following criteria are examined for\ncloud and pointing errors:\n\n- within a series, the minimum aerosol optical depth for each point is identified at each\nwavelength (r,?\'").\n\n- if the difference ( rUi- T?\n,)\n\nfor each spectral channel is less than the maximum of\n\n{zoimi" *0.05.0.02), then that point within a series is eonsidered cloud-free and pointing\nerror free.\n\nIf the above screening rcmovcs all but one point from a series, then an additional criterion\nbelow is applied to the spectral channels:\n\n- if the Angstrom parameter computed using all available channels between 440 and 870\nnm is greater than -0.1, thcn the point is considered cloud and pointing error frcc.\n\nThe Level 1.5 data series arc raised to Levcl 2.0 (quality-assured) series after final\ncalibration values are applied, spectral channels are evaluated for filter degradation and\nothcr possible instrumental problems or data anomalies; and manual data inspection is\ncompleted for possible cloud contaminated outliers.\n\nauthorship to Pr~nclpal\nInvestigators would be an expected sign of courtesy, however it rs\n\nnot a requ~rement\n\nFigure 7 presents the latitudinal dependence of aerosol optical depth in the Atlantic\nOcean and in Antarctica based on a number of cruises. Cn~ise\ntracks allowed for\nsampling of several aerosol regimes over the Northern and Southern Atlantic. In remote\noceanic areas not influenced by continental aerosol sources the aerosol optical depth is\ntypically below 0.10 at 500 nm. Saharan dust transport in the Tropical Atlantic near to the\ncoast of West Africa significantly increased the aerosol loading. Pollution sources in\nEurope can elevate optical depth in the coastal sampling areas to the north of 30 degrees.\nMeasurements in the Arctic region yielded a low average optical depth -0.05. During the\nAntarctic summer (January 2006 and January-February 2007) aerosol optical depth near\nthe coastline of Antarctica was even lower yet -0.02-0.03.\n\nThe whole data archive is mapped in Fig. 8. Daily averages from various cruises\ncharacterize regional aerosol optical depth and overall coverage of the network.\nObviously vast oceanic areas still have no or very limited coverage (e.g. in the Pacific\nand Indian oceans; near the coast of the South-East Asia; in the Caribbean). Further\nefforts are nccded to evaluate aerosol regimes over those oceanic regions.\n\nShip-based measuremetlts were compared with the AERONET data obtained from the\nisland and coastal sites along the cruise tracks. Island mcasurcments always posed a\nquestion whether data acquired could be considered rcprescntative for the ocean areas or\n\nclimate change and atmospheric radiation budget modeling, satellite validation studies,\nglobal and regional aerosol transport modeling, atmospheric correction and ocean color\nobservations. etc. Employing simple, standard and commercially available\ninstrumcntat~on,\ntraceable calibration, a scientifically sound proccssing scheme and easily\naccessible web-based public data archivc, the network has strong growth potential.\nExpanded spatial covcragc will contribute to enhanced understanding of aerosol optical\nproperties over the oceans and improve our knowledge of physical processes of maritime\naerosol production, transport and distribution. The database may help stimulate rcsearch\nand international collaboration in various scientific arcas.\n\nAcknowledgments.\nThc authors thank Dr. Hal Maring (NASA Headquarters) for his support of AERONET.\nThe authors would like to acknowledge managerial and operational support from\nW.W.Newcomb, MSorokin, A.Scully, A.Tran, D.A.Siegel, K.Knobelspiessc,\nD.Hamilton, L.Rainville, AJayakumar, S.Schick, D.Menzies (USA); N.T.O\'Neil1,\nC.Bourgeault-Bruncllc.
