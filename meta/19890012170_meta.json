These changes are made to Version 3.07 (released February, 1981) and are called Version 4.0. Version 4.0 improvements were performed by Sterling Software under contract to NASA Ames Research Center. The increased capabilities instituted in this version include the breakout of the source code into modules for ease of modification, addition of a more accurate curve fit routine, ability to handle higher frequency data, additional data analysis features, and improvements in the functionality of existing features. These modification will allow DATAMAP to be used on more data sets and will make future modifications and additions easier to implement.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890012170, "id": "cb4331a7b93f4fa09c35ae345a8101b0", "publicationDate": "1989-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890012170.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890012170/downloads/19890012170.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890012170/downloads/19890012170.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890012170/downloads/19890012170.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
