As Harwit's \"Cosmic Discovery\" pointed out, almost all great surprises in astronomy came from new equipment or new uses of equipment designed for other purposes, and many of those had military applications. I will outline prospects for new equipment and discuss how that equipment can be developed and built. Bigger and lighter mirrors, wavefront sensing and control, new detector technology, cryogenics -- each has its own social network, its own special possibilities, and its own funding sources outside science. I will discuss some examples drawn from real-life experience with the James Webb Space Telescope, a telescope that was said to have a \"giggle factor\" when it was proposed in 1995. Now each of the 10 major technologies has been brought to maturity, flight hardware is being built, and launch is planned for 2014. As an instrument builder all my life, I will speculate a little on what may be within our reach over the next few decades.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090032003, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Yale Univ.", "location": "New Haven, CT, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9bee773e49324a8385f27075533edb61", "id": "e208b4c1cda648609b87267d2555e590"}], "name": "Leigh-Page Prize Lectures", "location": "New Haven, CT", "id": "9bee773e49324a8385f27075533edb61"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090032003, "id": "f6fd504f98e6459bbf9e3f2027823c57", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
