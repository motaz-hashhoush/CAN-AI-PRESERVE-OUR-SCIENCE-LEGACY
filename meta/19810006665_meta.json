A spot beam antenna in the 14/21 GHz band which provides contiguous overlapping beams covering CONUS and two discrete beams covering Hawaii and Alaska were designed, developed, and tested. Two reflector antennas are required for providing contiguous coverage of CONUS. Each is comprised of one offset parabolic reflector, one flat polarization diplexer, and two separate planar array feeds. This antenna system provides contiguous spot beam coverage of CONUS, utilizing 15 beams. Also designed, developed and demonstrated was a shaped contoured beam antenna system which provides contiguous four time zone coverage of CONUS from a single offset parabolic reflector incorporating one flat polarization diplexer and two separate planar array feeds. The beams which illuminate the eastern time zone and the mountain time zone are horizontally polarized, while the beams which illuminate the central time zone and the pacific time zone are vertically polarized. Frequency reuse is achieved by amplitude and polarization isolation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810006665, "id": "ed2d45c60e1042119b4a5edc45b8368f", "publicationDate": "1980-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810006665.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810006665/downloads/19810006665.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810006665/downloads/19810006665.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810006665/downloads/19810006665.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
