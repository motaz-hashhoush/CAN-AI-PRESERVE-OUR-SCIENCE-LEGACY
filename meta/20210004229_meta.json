This toolkit provides capabilities for integrating telemetry verification points with predicted spacecraft commands and ground events in the Mission Sequence of Events (SOE) document. This toolkit is designed to greatly simplify the user's ability to access and view telemetry data, and also provide a means to view this data in a context of the commands and ground events that are used to interpret it. This paper will discuss the toolkit implementation, including design trade-offs and future for enhancing the automated capabilities.", "title": "Simplifying Operations with an Uplink/Downlink Integration Toolkit", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aguilera, Christine"}}, "id": "38d78772f4494f8f84d3b1060bbd53d3"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Louie, John"}}, "id": "5cc9418653c045e581584800db60dc82"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Joe, Chester"}}, "id": "5dad12d808ec4a8c91a968b5412a1f5e"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Guerrero, Ana Maria"}}, "id": "9c77b17b97c14bb898f67e784b43fda1"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, Kevin"}}, "id": "05047d2a58104c33a9b0b065a3e9e45b"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004229, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Murphy, Susan"}}, "id": "06b44aa49f174493bb2303509dc15b77"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T04:37:42.8576000+00:00", "id": 20210004229, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/33294", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210004229, "id": "94a7cb653ef74e4da9b809b6647260a5", "publicationDate": "1994-11-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
