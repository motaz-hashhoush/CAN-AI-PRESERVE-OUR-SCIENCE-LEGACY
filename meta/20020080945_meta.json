For some people, this can lead to clinical depression. NASA has conducted research in light therapy and employs it to help astronauts adjust internal rhythms during orbital flight. Dr. George Brainard, a medical researcher and NASA consultant, has developed a portable light therapy device, which is commercially available. The Light Visor allows continuous light therapy and can be powered by either batteries or electricity. Dr. Brainard continues to research various aspects of light therapy.", "title": "Light Visor", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080945, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080945, "isbn": "0-16-042100-4", "id": "9fb4ecc3698545f5b00017a337244c11", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080945.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080945/downloads/20020080945.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080945/downloads/20020080945.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080945/downloads/20020080945.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
