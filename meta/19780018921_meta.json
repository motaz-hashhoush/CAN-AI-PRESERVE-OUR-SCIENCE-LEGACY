This subject is of interest because of the emergence of future intense near equilibrium and blackbody sources, such as the gas core reactor, and electric discharge plasma devices, which are the key to the development of intense broadband radiation sources. The possible use of radiation from solar concentrators in space also fits into this general area. The varied use of photoexcitation of lasers are discussed ranging over direct optical pumping, photodissociation, and photoreionization. In addition, the new uses of laser transitions and chemical reactions is shown. This is accomplished through multiline operation of high pressure tunable lasers which can use the broadband radiation for multiphoton excitation.", "title": "Broadband photoexcitation of lasers", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T16:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780018921, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hess, R.
