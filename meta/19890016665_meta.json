Four concurrent studies, including one in-house at LeRC, are underway to determine the feasibility of performing model validation experiments aboard a free-flying spacecraft (S/C) called Cryogenic On-Orbit Liquid Depot-Storage, Acquisition and Transfer (COLD-SAT), using liquid hydrogen as the cryogen. The technology requirements for the experiments are described along with the initial LeRC concepts for the S/C and an experiment subsystem comprising of cryogenic tankage (a supply dewar and three receiver tanks), gas pressurization bottles (both helium and autogenous hydrogen), their associated plumbing, and instrumentation for data collection. Experiments were categorized into enabling/high priority Class 1 technologies and component/system Class 2 demonstrations. As initially envisioned by LeRC, COLD-SAT would have had a 1997 launch aboard a Delta-2 for a 6 month active lifetime in a 925 km orbit with a pseudo-inertial attitude.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19890016665, "endDate": "1989-07-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "UCLA"}}, "meetingId": "062befc4734243beb82c0558b4293efb", "id": "822c66f910f943e5883457ad8e73bb9c"}], "name": "1989 Cryogenic Engineering Conference and International Cryogenic Materials Conference", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "062befc4734243beb82c0558b4293efb", "startDate": "1989-07-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890016665, "id": "0885a8bb75264f17a2a276345783266b", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890016665.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890016665/downloads/19890016665.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890016665/downloads/19890016665.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890016665/downloads/19890016665.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
