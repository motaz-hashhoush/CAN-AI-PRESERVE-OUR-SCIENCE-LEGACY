An advanced chamber system was developed for acoustics and sample characterization. Sample interaction with an acoustic field was studied. The shaping of liquid drops by acoustic forces was also examined. The acoustic torque as a function of sample position and shape was studied along with levitated sample stability and the effects of feedback systems.", "title": "Containerless processing projects", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910012023, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910012023, "id": "5a738e8080044c67b00396b9d6ff03ba", "publicationName": "JPL, Proceedings of the First Workshop on Containerless Experimentation in Microgravity", "publicationDate": "1990-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910012023.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910012023/downloads/19910012023.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910012023/downloads/19910012023.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910012023/downloads/19910012023.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
