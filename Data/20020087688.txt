b"Inspection\nTools\n\nAt right, a segment of a Space Shuttle Solid\nRocket Motor is being scanned by a motorized\ncontamination sensing device to assure surface\ncleanliness prior to bonding of a rubber liner.\nThe sensor and scanning system are part of\na family of OPlOOO Surface Quality Monitors\ndeveloped by Photo Acoustic Technology Inc.\n(PAT), Westlake Village, California. The monitors are based on an inspection tool and technique known as Optically Stimulated Electron\nEmission (OSEE), invented in the early 1980s\nby Dr. Tennyson Smith of Rockwell International Corporation under contract to Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.\nPAT, which produces the sensors and scanning systems but not the associated robotics,\nwas founded on this technology, which is described as a significant advance in measuring\nthin layer contamination on the surface of a\nmaterial. PAT founders, including Mantosh\nChawla, president and chief executive, learned\nof the technology through an article in Tech\nBriefs, a NASA publication that reports on new\ninventions or innovations developed in the\ncourse of NASA programs to let potential users\nknow of technology available for transfer.\nThat beginning led to the development by\nPAT of the OPlOOO line, a series of non-destructive, non-contact surface contamination detection systems with wide industrial applicability.\nSome examples: inspection of a variety of surfaces prior to bonding, coating, painting, plating, etching, soldering, brazing or welding;\nmeasurement of lubricant thickness in computer hard disks; examination of the surface\nchemistry of printed circuit boards; inspection\nof blank semiconductorwafers prior to processing; and on-line inspection of metal sheeting.\nThe OPlOOO series' realtime pre-processing\ndetection capabilityassures 100percent surface\nquality testing and reduces the need for de-\n\nstructive sample testing after the product process is completed.\nThe OSEE technique involves brief exposure of the surface to be inspected to high\nenergy, low intensity ultraviolet radiation. The\nultraviolet energy interacts with the surface\nlayer, causing free electrons to be emitted from\nthe surface; these emissions are picked up by\nthe OPlOOO system's detector.\nWhere contamination exists, in the form\nof very thin layer substances, it interferes with\nthe electron flow and the degree of interference\nis proportionate to the thickness of the contaminant layer; this enables measurement of\nthe thickness by means of system signal output\nthat is proportional to the electron flow. A high\noutput reading in the system's display window\nindicates a clean or acceptable surface; a low\nreading shows the presence of foreign matter\nand the level of contamination. OPlOOO systems operate in a conventional atmosphere\nand do not require vacuum chambers or strict\ntemperature control; they work on virtually\nany type of material and can detect either\norganic or inorganic contamination.\n\n"
