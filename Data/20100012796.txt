b'tures the bit-to-symbol/symbol-to-bit operations like a tree that forms a portion\nof a Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT).\nMuch like an FFT, the parallel computation may be structured in order to reduce repeated computations. Symmetry\nin the values was noted and allowed for\nthe reduction of the bit-to-symbol mapping by a factor of 2.\nThis method computes bit-to-symbol likelihood mappings for a softin/soft-out decoder that operates over\nM-ary symbols, but receives and transmits bit-log likelihoods. There are two\nbit-to-symbol mappings. The first requires M \xe2\x80\x93 2 operations and log2 M \xe2\x80\x93 1\nclock cycles. The second requires O(M\nlog2 M) operations and log2log2 M\n\nclock cycles. The symbol-to-bit mapping requires log2 M clock cycles and\n3M \xe2\x80\x93 log2 M \xe2\x80\x93 4 operations. In a\npipelined architecture, the reduced\noperation counts also translate into reduced memory requirement.\nThis technology can apply to communications channels that use high-order\nconstellations and decode over symbols\nfrom that constellation. This would potentially include a large number of communications channels, such as cable\nmodems, disk drives, etc., as well as\nbeing a direct improvement to the Optical Communications End-to-End Testbed, which is currently in use to demonstrate, test, and develop deep-space\noptical communications technology.\n\nThis work was done by Bruce E.

(As used here,\n\xe2\x80\x9cconstellation\xe2\x80\x9d signifies, with respect to\na signal-modulation scheme, discrete\namplitude and/or phase points corresponding to symbols to be transmitted.)\nTheoretically, in comparison with traditional constellations, these constellations enable the communication systems\nin which they are used to more closely\napproach Shannon limits on channel capacities. Computational simulations\nhave shown performance gains of more\nthan 1 dB over traditional constellations.\nThese gains could be translated to bandwidth-efficient communications, variously, over longer distances, using less\npower, or using smaller antennas.\nThe opportunity to effect improvements through use of the proposed constellations arises as follows: The introduction of turbo and LDPC codes\nduring the 1990s made it possible to formulate coding schemes that afford nearShannon-capacity performance for binary and quaternary phase-shift-keying\nmodulation schemes. However, in these\nand other channel-capacity-approaching\ncoding schemes, when traditional signal\nconstellations are used, the gap between\nthe achievable performance and the\nShannon or the Gaussian capacity in-\n\n1\n\nPAM\n2\n\nPAM\n32\n\nPAM\n16\n\nPAM\n8\n\nPAM\n4\nTraditional Constellations\nOptimized Constellations\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nCapacity in Bits Per Symbol\n\nGaps Between Parallel Decoding Capacity and Gaussian Capacity [quantified as equivalent signal-tonoise-ratio (SNR) gaps] were computed for optimized and traditional PAM 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-point\nconstellations.\n\ncreases with bandwidth efficiency (in effect, as more bits are packed into each\ntransmitted symbol).

Unlike\nin traditional constellations, both the locations of the points and the bit labels of\nthe points are optimized jointly. In the\noptimization process, they are chosen to\nmaximize either the joint capacity or the\nparallel decoding capacity at a target\nuser data rate. Through numerical capacity computations, it has been shown\nthat except in special cases, no constellations are universally optimal for all code\nrates and that the optimization of a constellation must target a specific code rate.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, April 2010\n\nThe proposed constellations have\nbeen used in a bit-interleaved coded\nmodulation system employing state-ofthe-art LDPC codes.
