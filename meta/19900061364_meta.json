The SSF partners have over the last six years defined user requirements, decided on the hardware to be manufactured, and constructed a framework for long-term cooperation. SSF will be composed of user elements furnished by the foreign partners and a U.S.-supplied infrastructure encompassing the truss assembly, electrical power system, and crew living quarters. The U.S. will also furnish a lab and a polar-orbit platform; ESA, a second lab and the coorbiting Free-Flying Laboratory, as well as a second polar platform. Japan's Japanese Experiment Module shall include an Exposed Facility and an Experimental Logistics module. Canada will contribute the Mobile Servicing System robotic assembler/maintainer for the whole of SFF.", "title": "Freedom is an international partnership", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T12:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900061364, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kohrs, Richard H."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "8693612f6cef49d5bf567328560f8646"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900061364, "publications": [{"volume": "28", "submissionId": 19900061364, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "b772b7a1ce354015babe9b7a017906b7", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1990-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
