Both\ntechnologies tend to\nmake aircraft more\nsusceptible to lightning\ndamage. But research by\n. - . .\nNASA, the rederal\nAviation Administration\n(FAA) and other aviation groups has substantially\nimproved understanding of how lightning affects\naircraft and produced countermeasures that allow\nplane builders to\nincorporate these\nperformance-enhancing\ntechnologies while\nimproving safety.\nNASA played the\nleading role in lightning\ninvestigations with its\nseven-year (1980-86)\nStorm Hazards Research\nProgram, undertaken at\nCongressional direction\n- by Langley Research\nCenter - to determine\nthe dangers of\nthunderstorms to\ncommercial aviation. The\nproject employed a\nspecially-equipped,\nprotected F-106B\nresearch airplane, whose\njob it was to seek out\nthunderstorms in the\n\nI\n\nhope of getting struck by lightning. It was highly\nsuccessful -more than 800 strikes were recorded.\nThe program proved to be a giant step in advancing\nknowledge of lightning hazards and generating\nprotective technology.\nA key player in both the research program and\nthe transfer of the technology to the aircraft industry\nis Lightning Technologies, Inc., Pittsfield,\nMassachusetts, a small engineering and testing firm\nengaged in design and verification of protection\nagainst lightning and other electrical hazards.\nLightning Technologies is a spinoff company. It was\nfounded in 1977 by president J. Anderson Plumer, a\nformer employee of a NASA contractor - General\nElectric Company's High Voltage Laboratory -who\nhad acquired extensive experience in lightning\ninvestigations. Shown at left beside a 1.5 million volt\ngenerator used for lightning simulations, Plumer is an\nexample of the personnel-type of spinoff, wherein\nNASA technology is transferred to the private sector\nby the occupational shift of a scientist or engineer\nonce engaged in NASA research activity.\nIn addition, much of the company's\ntechnological capability stemmed from its work as\nsupporting contractor for the Storm Hazards\nResearch Program, which involved assisting NASA in\n\nplanning the program, improving and vedying the\nlightning protection for the F-106B and, together with\nother organizations, analyzing the data. Both the\ncompany and its president worked extensively with\nthe SAE Lightning Subcommittee,which formulates\nstandards for aircraft lightning protection. The\nexperience and technology thus gained has made the\ncompany a leader in lightning protection for\naerospace systems.\nAmong the findings of the Storm Hazards\nResearch Program, Langley researchers learned that\nmultiple-burst lightning strikes inject a large number\nof randomly occurring electric currents into the\nairplane, producing rapidly changing magnetic fields\nthat can induce erroneous responses, faulty\ncommands or other upsets in sophisticated electronic\nsystems.\nThis led the FAA - and airworthiness cerhfying\nauthorities in other countries -to require, beginning\nin 1987, that aircraft electronic systems which\nperform flight-critical functions be protected from\ndamage or upset due to the effects of the multipleburst lightning environment.\nThe NASA research produced another important\nfinding: that lightning strikes may hit almost any\nspot on an airplane surface, not just - as earlier\n\nbelieved - the plane's extremities, such as wings,\npropeller tips and certain other areas. That finding is\nof great importance to designers employing\ncomposite materials, which are less conductive,\nhence more vulnerable to lightning damage than the\naluminum alloys they replace.\nLightning Technologies uses its NASA-acquired\nexperience and technology to develop protective\nmeasures for both electronic systems and composite\nstructures, including better electrical bonding and\nshielding methods for interconnecting wiring and\nmethods of increasing system immunity through\nimproved computer software and application of\nsurge-suppression devices. The company also\nprovides protection design and verification testing\nservices for complete aircraft systems or their\nindividual components; it numbers most major\naircraft and component manufacturers among its\nworldwide clients.\nThe accompanying photos illustrate some of\nLightning Technologies work: the center photo\nshows a simulated lightning strike on a model of an\nF-106 similar to the one\nused in the NASA\nresearch program; above\nright, a full-size aircraft\ncomponent undergoes a\nhigh-voltage lightning\ntest; at right, a company\ntechnician prepares a\nmodel of an airplane\nfuselage for computer\nanalysis.\n\nMultipleburst\nlightning\nstrikes i?aject\na lace\nnumber of\n\nrandomly\noccurring\nelectric\ncurrents into\nthe airplane\n\n"
