The extension is general, requiring only input data concerning block structure, connectivity, and boundary conditions. Imbedded grid singular points are permitted, but must be prevented from moving in space. Solutions for workshop cases 1 and 2 are obtained on multi-block grids and illustrate both increased resolution of and alignment with the solution. A mesh quality assessment criteria is proposed to determine how well a given mesh resolves and aligns with the solution obtained upon it. The criteria is used to evaluate the grid quality for solutions of workshop case 6 obtained on both static and dynamically adapted grids. The results indicate that this criteria shows promise as a means of evaluating resolution.", "title": "A structured multi-block solution-adaptive mesh algorithm with mesh quality assessment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960011647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ingram, Clint L."}, "organization": {"name": "North Carolina Univ.", "location": "Raleigh, NC, United States"}}, "id": "7b3d1f23a40d4b7b8d0203fde1e3c66c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960011647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Laflin, Kelly R."}, "organization": {"name": "North Carolina Univ.", "location": "Raleigh, NC, United States"}}, "id": "65f1cad568a341e19b4e480806b373b4"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19960011647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mcrae, D.
