The study was sponsored by the following NASA Headquarters organizations: Office of Space Science, Office of Aeronautics\nand Space Technology, and Office of Space Transportation Systems. The NASA Ames Research Center hosted\nthe study and provided administrative support through\nits Life Sciences Directorate. Expert assistance in the\nmany aspects of the study came from NASA Headquarters, NASA centers, universities, industry, and from\nindividual consultan ts.\nThis summer study was the largest and most comprehensive investigation of space manufacturing and habitation to date; forty senior research workers and ten\nstudents participated. The six-week study was preceded\nby several months of planning and preparation, and was\nfollowed by extensive work on manuscript checking,\nreview, and assembly. The study topics reflected the\nresearch areas requiring the most intensive attention as\nofrnid-1977; they were:\nGroup I:\n\nRegenerative life-support systems and controlled environment agriculture.\n\nGroup II:\n\nParametric studies of efficient habitats in\nspace. Time and cost analysis of a space\nmanufacturing program plan.\n\nGroup III: Detection and analysis of special classes of\nasteroids suitable as material resources for\nspace manufacturing; studies of retrieval\nmissions.\n\nGroup IV: Electromagnetic mass drivers for use as interorbital engines, as devices to launch lunar\nmaterial into space, and as tugs for the\nretrieval of asteroidal material.\nGroup V:\n\nChemical processing of non terrestrial material in space; manufacture of metals and glass\nfibers, beneficiation, and design of processing plants.\n\nThese five task groups each produced two or more\ntechnical papers, signed by the contributing members.\nThe papers were subjected to independent peer review\nby scientists not connected with the study. During the\ncourse of the study, frequent formal and informal\nexchanges of information occurred between task groups,\nso that the entire effort evolved in a coherent fashion\nand was directed toward common goals. However, each\ngroup remained responsible for the choice of its topics\nand for its conclusions.\nA listing of all the participants is given on pages vii-x.\nIt would be inappropriate for me to single out particular\npeople or groups for special mention, since all involved\napplied their skills with dedication and enthusiasm.\nInstead, I thank everyone for their contributions to the\nsuccess of the study, and also for making it a united and\nwarmly cooperative personal experience.\n\nGERARD K.

A recommended methodology is also presented as\na basis for future technology-development activities in this area.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES\nThe essentials for human survival are commonly\nreferred to as the life-support system (LSS). Requirements for life support on manned space missions include\nthose provisions and accommodations that are necessary\nto maintain human occupants of the vehicle or space\nstation in a functional state. A functional state is defined\nas the willingness and physical ability to perform assignments effectively and to accept responsibilities for the\nduration of the mission. Thus, in general, the necessary\nprovisions and accommodations consist of a primary set\n(adequate food, potable water, breathable air, and safety\nfrom identifiable hazards) and a secondary set (waste\ndisposal, personal hygiene, medical care, and reasonable\ncomfort). It is recognized that these factors affect the\npsychological, as well as the physiological well-being;\nhowever, the focus of this paper is on physiological\nconsiderations.\nThis report was prepared by the Life-Support Systems Group of the 1977 NASA Ames Summer Study on\n"Space Settlements and Industrialization Using Nonterrestrial Materials." This report summarizes the group\'s\nanalyses and recommendations concerning several issues\nthat were derived from the objectives of the group\'s\nstudy activity. These objectives included:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identification of the areas where partial or complete closure of the life-support system (LSS) loop\nshould be considered\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Development of a sound methodology for identifying, screening, and evaluating candidate biological and physicochemical processing components\nfor regenerative life-support systems applicable to\nspace habitats\nThe 1977 NASA Ames Summer Study was concerned\nprincipally with industrial production in space using\nnonterrestrial materials, housing, and life support for an\nindustrial work force in space, and space settlements per\nse. The study planners reasoned that the earliest industrial activities in space probably will depend on "openloop" life-support provisions, including resupply from\nEarth for food and perhaps some partial regeneration of\natmosphere components and water. However, beyond\nthis early transitional period, it is believed that long-term\nspace settlements for space industrialization will require\nessentially completely regenerative, or "closed," lifesupport systems. Therefore, the charter of the LifeSupport Systems Group for the 1977 Summer Study\nwas to determine the requirements for achieving this\nclosure, including particularly the research that will be\nnecessary over a period of many years.\n\n1\n\nThe group\'s findings during the summer study are\npresented in this paper and its companion, subsequent\npaper entitled "Research Planning Criteria for Regenerative Life-Support Systems Applicable to Space Habitats." The information presented in these two papers\nrepresents interim results on systems analysis, the identification of research options, and the formulation of\nguidelines for the eventual assignment of research priorities. However, follow-up studies are anticipated and they\nwill be reported later with more detailed assessments of\nresearch and development options and recommended\npriorities for resource allocations.\n\nRATIONALE FOR SPECIFYING THE\nEXTENT OF CLOSURE\nWith minor exceptions, life-support functions on\nmanned space missions to date have been accomplished\nby (1) the on-board storage at launch, of food, water,\nand atmosphere components; (2) removal (but not conversion) of trace contaminants and excess carbon\ndioxide; and (3) storage and return to Earth of waste\nresidues. Provisions for personal hygiene and medical\ncare were very limited until the Skylab missions. These\nlife-support procedures to date have at least been inherently reliable and safe if not a source of comfort, convenience, and pleasure for crew members.\nThe principal focus of prior NASA-sponsored\nresearch and development on life-support systems has\ncentered on partial closure of the mass exchange through\nthe use of physicochemical processes for atmosphere\nrevitalization, wash water regeneration (nonpotable use),\nand waste conversion to ventable gases, reusable\n(potable) water, and a storable, compact ash. Food production and regeneration have received very little attention for space-mission applications.\nSeveral trade-off determinations combined to provide\nthe rationale for this orientation of LSS design and\ntechnology development until the present. These include\nthe following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For short-duration Earth-orbit or lunar missions\n(which include all manned missions to date), the\nhigh costs and long lead times required to develop\nand flight-qualify reliable regenerative systems\ncould not be justified for any components of the\nLSS, for these missions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For longer duration missions (up to some undefined total duration) which involve more crew\nmembers (up to some undefined total number),\n\n2\n\nsome regeneration could be justified; particularly\natmospheric revitalization, water recycling, and\nwaste conversion to carbon dioxide (then oxygen),\nusable water, and a compact ash, but all food\nwould still be stored on-board at launch, or\nresupplied periodically.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For the latter, partially closed-system applications,\nphysicochemical processes were perceived to be\nmore attractive because of high reliability and\nenergy efficiency; the design difficulties associated\nwith photosynthetic processes (e.g., the need for\nnatural light would require large transparent ports\nin the vehicle\'s shell, constant orientation toward\nthe Sun, and provisions for light compensation or\ncomplex cycle functions when the vehicle operates\nin the shadow of the Earth); unknown effects of\nlong-duration and low-gravity or zero-gravity exposure on biological systems, etc.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Beyond the undefined thresholds for mission duration and crew size (for which some regeneration\nwas considered to be desirable), it was perceived\nthat food regeneration, and therefore essentially\ncomplete closure of the LSS, very likely could\nbecome necessary, particularly for destinations\nthat are relatively remote from the Earth, and that\nbiological processes might have some potential for\nthis application (possibly performing atmosphereregeneration and water-reclamation functions as\nwell).\nFunding priorities for life-support systems research\nand development are assigned according to projected\ntime frames of need and readiness for mission applications. Therefore, in view of the limited resources that\nwere available for advanced teclmology development in\nthese areas, research on completely closed systems and,\nin particular, biological processing components, received\nlittle or no support, except for minor exploratory efforts\nthat decreased to virtually nothing several years ago.\nCurrent interest in self-sustaining, regenerative lifesupport systems derives principally from the possibility\nthat habitats will be needed in the coming decades to\nsupport missions that could well involve a large number\nof people working in space for long periods of time and,\nin some cases, at sites that are quite remote from the\nEarth.\nThe inputs required to support a person in space are\nshown in table 1. Over the course of a year, the average\nperson consumes 3 times his body weight in food,\n4 times his weight in oxygen, and 8 times his weight in\ndrinking water. Over the course of a lifetime, these items\namount to over a 1000 times an adult\'s weight.\n\nTABLE 1.- INPUTS REQUIRED TO\nSUPPORT A PERSON IN SPACE\n\nType of input\n\nAmounts,\nkg per person per:\nDay\n\nDomestic water\nTotal\n\n0.6\n0.9\n1.8\n2.3\n\n219\n329\n657\n840\n\n15,300\n23,000\n46,000\n58,800\n\n--\n\n5.6\n\nSubtotal\n\nlifetime\n\n--\n\nFood (dry)\nOxygen\nDrinking water\nSanitary water\n\nYear\n\n2,045\n\n143,100\n\n16.8\n-22.4\n\n6,132\n\n429,240\n\n--\n\n8,177\n\n572,340\n\nAs discussed above, for long-term space missions, it\nwill probably be necessary to replenish or recycle supplies on board. The quantities of supplies required\n\nincrease with the duration of the flight and the cost of\nsupplies required for the journey is proportional to their\nweight at launch. At some break-even point it will probably be less costly to send up the equipment to recycle\nthe supplies from wastes than to use up the provisions\non a once-through basis.\nConsider, for example, wash water which is relatively\neasy to recycle because the contaminant levels are low\n(about 350 ppm; ref. 1). A number of processes have\nbeen investigated for wash water recycle, including systems based on muitifiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse\nosmosis, and vapor compression distillation (ref. 2). A\nschematic of a system based on reverse osmosis (RO),\nwith vapor compression distillation to concentrate the\nrejected wastes, is shown in figure 1. Waste water from a\nstorage tank is passed through progressively finer cartridge filters to remove particulates that can foul the\nreverse osmosis membranes. The filtered water enters a\nrecirculation loop of RO modules, where the water that\npermeates the membranes is collected and stored at\npasteurization temperature. The concentrated "brine" is\nsent to a vapor compression distillation unit which\n\n.--------\'---------------1\n\nVAPOR\nCOMPRESSION\nDISTILLATION\nUNIT\n\n30~m\n\nRECIRCULATION\nPUMP\n\nSINK\n\nFigure 1.- Schematic diagram of typical wash-water recycling system (from ref. 3).\n\n3\n\nreduces the contaminants to a concentrated slurry,\neither to be stored on\xc2\xb7board or processed further.\nEven a recycling system such as this requires that\nreplacement filters, membranes, and chemical additives\nbe brought from Earth, with their quantity depending\non the length of the flight. Thus the total weight at\nlaunch of the system increases with flight duration.\nFor a six-person crew, launch weight as a function of\nflight duration is shown in figure 2, for state of the art as\nwell as projected technology. Also shown is the launch\nweight of an alternative system, multifiltration, based on\nsequential filtration with cartridge filters, activated\ncarbon, and ion-exchange resins. Based on current\nknowledge, an RO-type of system for wash water recycle\nwould probably be preferred for a long\xc2\xb7duration mission.\n1.2\n\n\'"\n~\nI\n\n1\n\nX\n\nST ATE OF THE ART\n\n\'"\n-"\n1-\'\n::t:\n~\n\nw\n\nDOMESTIC WATER\nCONSUMPTION;\nONCE\xc2\xb7THROUGH\n\n.8\n\ni:\n::t:\nU\nZ\n\n~ .6\n\nA number of physicochemical techniques have been\nsuggested for recycling oxygen from CO 2 (refs. 6, 7).\nThese methods involve separ\\ltion of CO 2 from air followed by reaction of CO 2 to produce O 2 and carbon\nby-products (methane in the Sabatier process, or solid\ncarbon in the Bosch process). However, processes of this\ntype are not suitable for a closed life-support system for\nflights of long duration. Although oxygen is generated\nfor reuse, the carbon present in the food that was\nconsumed is ultimately converted to a solid form and\nmust be stored. To close the system, the carbon must be\nreturned to the food cycle from which it originated.\nAll of the carbon in human food originates either\ndirectly or indirectly (i.e., through animal consumption)\nfrom vegetation. Thus, to close the system, all of the\ncarbon in the outputs from living components of the\nsystem (e.g., humans, plants, and animals) should be\nconverted back to carbon dioxide so that it can be\nphotosynthesized back into vegetation. In this manner,\nit is possible to satisfy simultaneously the recycle\nrequirements for oxygen and hydrogen. For example, if\nthe average carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen composition\nof vegetation is represented by the formula CHmO n ,\nthen the stoichiometry of net plant growth (photosynthesis less respiration) is:\n\n..J\n\nIZ\n\nW\n..J\n\nCO 2\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n::: .4\n\n(m n)\n4 2\n\nm\n+ - H 2 0 = CH 0 + 1 + - - - O 2\n2\n\nm n\n\n:l\n\no\nW\n\n..J\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nb\nI-\n\n.2\n2\xc2\xb7DAY\nBREAK\xc2\xb7EVEN\n\nFigure 2.- txample of attractiveness of wash-water\nrecycling as mission duration lengthens.\nHuman wastes and other organic wastes (food wastes\nand trash) can be turned into carbon dioxide, water, and\nash by presently available methods. Wet and dry oxida\xc2\xb7\ntion systems have been built and tested on a demonstration scale. In wet oxidation, an aqueous slurry is\n0\n0\ntreated at moderate temperatures (150 -250 C) under\n7\n2\n6\nhigh pressures (8.3X10 to L5XI0 N/m ) (ref. 4). In\ndry oxidation, toilet wastes and aqueous slurries of pulverized trash are first concentrated by evaporation of\nwater, and the concentrate is then incinerated (ref. 5).\nWater vapor and off-gases from the incinerator are\npassed through catalytic oxidizer beds to completely\nconvert organic contaminants to CO 2 and H2 0.\n\n4\n\nA portion of the edible plant output is oxidized back to\nCO 2 and H 2 0 directly by human and animal metab\xc2\xb7\nolism. The remainder of the edible portion is partially\noxidized to products which appear in urine, feces, perspiration, and exhaled breath. If these partially oxidized\nproducts, together with the nonedible portion of the\nplants, are subsequently oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 0, then\nthe net effect of human and animal metabolism plus\nwaste oxidation is the reverse of the net photosynthesis\nstoichiometry. Thus, incorporation of a process like wet\noxidation or incineration for complete conversion of\norganic wastes to CO 2 and H 2 0 simultaneously closes\nthe carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen recycle loop.\nThe logistical basis for the recycling of the wash\nwater, as discussed above and characterized in figure 2,\nalso is applicable to the regeneration of the food supply.\nFigure 3 illustrates that economic break-even or crossover points occur when comparing the alternatives of\neither regenerating food at the space settlement (with\nsome nominal resupply from Earth) or continually\nresupplying all food from Earth (with no regeneration).\nThe ranges of cumulative food-weight transportation\n\nc\n\nTABLE 2.- OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES FOR\nSTORED WEIGHT OF FOOD IN A REASONABLE DIET FOR SPACE MISSIONS\n\n5l\n\n!.\n!.\n~ 10\n\nS\n\nC\xc2\xb7\nw\n\n....\na:\n\nFood weights,\ngrams per person per day\n\nS\n\n0\n<>-\n\n(/)\n\nz\n\n\xc2\xab\na:\n....\n....\nJ:\n\nFood item\n\n6\n\nNatural\n\nDry\n\nFreeze-dried\nand packaged\n\nt:l\n\niii 4\n\n;:\nC\n\n0\n0\n\n...\nw\n\n>\n\n>=\n\xc2\xab\n...J\n::;)\n\n::;:\n\n0\n\n14\n\n16\n\n::;)\n\n<.>\n\nFigure 3.- Comparison of transported weight requirements for alternative modes of food supply.\nrequirements per inhabitant, shown as functions of mission duration (or continuous time in space) in figure 3,\nare based on best available information. The state of the\nart for food storage was taken as 650 kg per person per\nyear, which is approximately that for present Space\nShuttle food-supply planning. This includes thermostabilized and intermediate moisture foods to achieve a\nlevel of palatability and general acceptability better than\nthat of the food used on Apollo missions (about\n400 kg/person/yr). The optimistic estimate for stored\nfoods is about 475 kg per person per year. This is based\non the analysis summarized in table 2, which characterizes a reasonable diet and assumes, optimistically, that\ntechnology developments in the future will be able to\naccommodate the freeze-drying and packaging of these\ndietary components in an acceptable palatable form\nwithin the per-person annual resupply weight value of\n475 kg. It should be noted, however, that foods could be\nchosen differently to minimize the total weight and\nperhaps reduce this optimistic weight-requirement value\nby a factor of 2 (Le., to about 220 kg/person/yr). This\nweight-conserving food supply does not represent conventional terrestrial diets, however, and its acceptability\nmay be limited. For this reason it was not used in this\nanalysis as the optimistic possibility for food storage.\nThe optimistic value for food-regeneration requirements shown in figure 3 was taken as 1500 kg/person\n(total biomass holdup for the self-sustaining, steady-state\ncondition). Therefore, that amount of total foodproducing material must be transported from Earth\nbefore the food regeneration process can reach this con-\n\nTotal\n\n175\n142\n75\n36\n\n154\n114\n75\n33\n\n180\n110\n80\n38\n\n608\n218\n76\n18\n785\n55\n12\n30\n15\n\n535\n88\n18\n6\n103\n12\n30\n15\n\n500\n100\n22\n7\n110\n60\n15\n70\n16\n\n--\n\nCereals\nPotatoes\nSugar\nBeans and nuts\nVegetables\nand fruit\nMeat\nEggs\nFish\nMilk\nFat\nDrinks (dry)\nAlcohol\nSalts\n\n--\n\n--\n\n2,245\n\n1,238\n\n1,308\n\n~55\n\ndition. The slope of this line represents an optimistic\nassumption that only 100 kg/person of resupplied biomass or food must be transported annually from Earth\nto compensate for supplemental requirements, attrition\nof material, etc. The initial supply value of\n1500 kg/person agrees well with the value presented in\nthe Final Report of the 1975 NASA Ames Summer\nStudy (ref. 8), although this figure was derived independently in a more rigorous manner by members of the\nlife Support Systems Group of the 1977 NASA Ames\nSummer Study.\nThe pessimistic value for food-regeneration biomass\nrequirements was estimated to be 4000 kg/person. This\namounts to between 2 and 3 times the optimistic value,\nand was selected only to obtain some estimate of the\nsensitivity of the crossover point to the magnitude of the\nvalue assigned to food-regeneration biomass requirements. Similarly, the slope of the pessimistic regeneration line was chosen to be significantly greater than that\nfor the optimistic regeneration line, to portray sensitivity. This slope represents a pessimistic assumption of an\nannual resupply requirement of 350 kg/person.\n\n5\n\nFigure 3 illustrates several important points:\n1. The point of crossover, on the basis of food\nweight that would have to be transported, is quite sensitive to the requirement for the biomass supply to sustain\nfood regeneration; nevertheless, a crossover occurs on\nthe state-of-the-art stored-food line for both the optimistic and the pessimistic regeneration lines, with a\nrange of about 3 to about 14 years, and an average of\nabout 8 years.\n2. If the optimistic food storage capability can realistically be achieved, food-regeneration technology must\nbe able to provide stable regeneration with a biomass\nrequirement significantly smaller than that represented\nby the pessimistic line; otherwise, crossover will not\noccur at a reasonable mission duration and regeneration\nof food will not be able to compete with food storage\n(or resupply).\n3. Even if the achievable initial per-person biomass\nrequirement for stable regeneration of food is no better\nthan the pessimistic value, but the annual resupply\nrequirement is at least as low as the optimistic regeneration case (i.e., 100 kg/person), it can be shown that\ncrossovers with the state of the art and the optimistic\nfood-storage lines would occur at about 8 and 12 years,\nrespectively.\nAt this point it should be emphasized that the foodstorage versus food\xc2\xb7regeneration comparisons have been\nbased on the required weight to be transported to the\nspace habitat for each case. Assuming transportation\ncost to be the only significant economic factor, this is a\nreasonable basis for direct comparisons. However, in\nreality, the cost of research and development necessary\nto achieve stable regeneration of food, compared with,\nfor example, the amount of importation of supplies\ncharacterized by the optimistic regeneration line in\nfigure 3, might be high enough to greatly change the\ncrossover point to a much longer mission duration in a\ntotal-cost comparison of state-of-the-art food storage\nwith resupply. Nevertheless, since the weight (and cost)\nof subsystems needed to provide atmosphere regeneration and water reclamation are not included for the\nstored-food cases in figure 3, these comparisons are quite\nconservative.\nAnother very significant factor would be the cost of\ntransporting material into space. A greater amount for\nthis cost might significantly offset extensive research and\ndevelopment costs to achieve the optimistic food regeneration capability. Furthermore, consideration must also\nbe given to the extent of transportation cost that might\nbe required to provide equipment for cultivating, harvesting, processing, preparing, and delivering the food in\n\n6\n\na regenerative system, and for the additional waste processing associated with such a system.\nTherefore, the cost-benefit analysis for the comparison of resupply versus regeneration of food is very\ncomplex and cannot be accomplished effectively until\nreliable capability and cost estimates can be made. Even\nmore complex and information-dependent is the selection and design of an integrated regenerative life-support\nsystem for a space habitat. Therefore, the information\nrequirements must be fully understood and then satisfied through careful planning.\n\nPHILOSOPHY OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS\nDESIGN\nIntegrated systems design refers to the process of\ndefining the requirements that must be satisfied by a\nregenerative life-support system, identifying component\nand subsystem options, screening and selecting among\nthese options for integration into an effective system\nthat satisfies all requirements, and then integrating this\nlife-support system design into the overall habitat design.\nBy far the best approach is to accomplish all of this by\nway of a total system analysis and design procedure that\nconsiders all component and subsystem interactions at\nthe same time. The result has been demonstrated extensively to be superior to the outcome of the alternative\nprocedure of fixing or optimizing one aspect of the\ndesign and then trying to retrofit other subsystems into\nthis fixed arrangement such that, typically, the latter\nsubsystems cannot function optimally. The best\napproach requires careful attention to all identifiable\noptions and the eventual selection of a totally optimum\ncombination of components and subsystems that will\nmeet all performance requirements in a stable, safe, and\nreliable manner.\nThis is especially vital for completely regenerative\nlife-support systems which will very likely include biological as well as physicochemical components. The balancing of the input and output streams among the components to maintain stable operation can be expected to\nbe extremely sensitive. This requires detailed consideration of interface constraints inside and outside the\nsystem. The task would probably be much easier if only\nterrestrial conditions needed to be considered. A great\ndeal more is known about the performance of humans,\nanimals, and plants in terrestrial gravity and in an air\natmosphere. Almost nothing is known about the effects\nof long-term zero-gravity or fractional-gravity exposure\non plants and animals. In general, this means that\n\nenough data will be needed, at a minimum, to support\nextensive sensitivity analyses for the various systems\ndesign scenarios that should be considered. This must\ninclude characterization of the effects that choices of\nexternal factors (gravity, atmosphere, adjacent activities,\netc.) can have on the closed life-support system option,\nas well as the effects that each life-support system\noption can have on other elements of the habitat design.\nOverall, this requires that mission planners and conceptual designers remain aware of and give adequate\nconsideration to the sensitivity of the regenerative lifesupport system\'s selection, design, and performance, and\nits potential effect on total habitat design. Otherwise,\nthese will be neglected and the life-support system will\nbe developed in a retrofit mode. This would very likely\nresult in a low probability of optimality in the selection\nor operation of the life-support system. Furthermore,\nthe consequences could well be disastrous.\nAs was discussed earlier in this paper, there are various approaches to and degrees of closure. At the present\ntime not enough is known to support the identification\nof optimum choices. However, a particularly effective\nprocedure for the identification and characterization of\noptions involves the steps shown in figure 4. The procedure begins by selecting a diet scenario which is disaggregated into the types and quantities of food that will\nbe specified to meet the dietary requirements. From this\nlist of required food the resources necessary for producing the vegetables, fruits, and grains on the list are\ndetermined. From the agricultural characteristics of\nthese crops the amount of waste that will be generated\n(i.e., material not consumed by the humans) is estimated. Then the requirements for feed and resources to\nproduce the animal-derived food components of the diet\nscenario are determined, based on the utilization of the\nby-products from the crops. The waste generated from\nthe production and processing of the animal-derived\nfood can be estimated at this point.\nNext, it is necessary to determine the wasteprocessing scheme needed to regenerate .the required\ninputs to the plants and animals (i.e., nutrients, water,\ncarbon dioxide, etc.). Processing requirements for food\nproduction and preparation can be estimated at this\npoint. These include equipment, facilities, and resources\n(e .g., water and energy) for milking cows, processing the\nmilk and its derivative products, baking bread, processing meat and vegetables, refrigeration, packing, and storing, to name a few. Finally, it is necessary to determine\nthe stability characteristics of the proposed system that\nhas been put together conceptually by this procedure,\nand identify requirements for monitoring and control.\n\nSPECI FY DI ET\nSCENARIO\n\n1\nDETERMINE\nCROP\xc2\xb7GROWING\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n1\nDETERMINE\nANIMAL\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n1\nDETERMINE\nWASTE PROCESSING\nREQUIREMENTS AND\nPROCEDURES\n\n1\nDETERMINE\nPROCESS EQUIPMENT\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n!\nDETERMINE\nSTABILITY AND CONTROL\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nFigure 4.- Stepwise procedure for formulation of a candidate regenerative life-support system scenario.\nThis latter step provides the basis for the analysis of the\nsystem\'s sensitivity to perturbations at its internal and\nexternal interfaces.\nThe major internal features of the life-support system\nthat can be varied to generate different scenario options\nare the diet and the method of closure. The method of\nclosure includes both the functions in the system that\nwill be closed and the component biological and\nphysicochemical species that will be employed to accomplish these functions in a closed mode. Although the\noptions that are possible for the variation of these features are many, it would be reasonable to start by\nselecting a diet that closely represents conventional terrestrial choices of food and then determining the component requirements for full closure of the life-support\nsystem. From a baseline case of this type, subsequent\nanalyses can progress to other diet and closure options.\nFor each scenario option, the trade-offs associated with\nit should be examined carefully in comparison with\nother proposed options. Analyses of this type are\n\n7\n\nextremely valuable in identifying research required to\nimprove the data base such that the evaluational comparisons will be more reliable.\nSeveral scenarios have been considered and reported\nto date. The diet associated with the scenarios considered by the 1975 Ames Summer Study team (ref. 8),\nHenson and IIenson (ref. 9), and Soviet lest:archers\n(ref. 10) did not closely represent conventional terrestrial choices of food. A scenario based on a more conventional diet is currently being formulated and evaluated by the Bioenvironmental Systems Study Group on\nNASA Contract No. NASw-298I. The foundation for\nthis diet is presented in the subsequent companion paper\nprepared by the Life Support Systems Group of the\n1977 NASA Ames Summer Study (entitled "Research\nPlanning Criteria for Regenerative Life-Support Systems\nApplicable to Space Habitats").\nIt was mentioned earlier in this report that the lifesupport system also has external "trade-off interfaces."\nThese are defined as environmental or operational conditions that the life-support systems share with other components or systems of the habitat. For example, the\ngravitational force designed into the habitat is an environmental condition that is shared by all systems; any\nconnections or interlocks between the section of the\nhabitat in which the regenerative life-support system\nfunctions and, perhaps, a manufacturing section, would\nrepresent shared operational interfaces. Good systems\nengineering practices require that these interfaces be\nselected with careful attention to, and adequate knowledge of, the effect of the selected conditions on all\nsystems that share these interfaces. The choice is then\noptimized with respect to all these systems through\ntrade-off analyses that are based on a sound rationale.\nTypical external interfaces for a regenerative lifesupport system in a space habitat are discussed below.\nAtmosphere Environment\nThe parameters of atmosphere selection include total\npressure, composition, and the individual partial pressures of the principal constituents (oxygen, carbon\ndioxide, and nitrogen, or other inert diluent). The factors involved in the selection of any atmosphere other\nthan terrestrial air are very complex. Nevertheless, it is\nvery clear that hasty decisions must not be made simply\nfor the convenience of engineering design or other logistical or operational considerations. The health and safety\nof the habitat\'s occupants must come first, and this\nincludes the need for a stabilized and optimally performing life-support system. As stated earlier, there is a\n\n8\n\nserious lack of information about the effects of exposure\nto nonterrestrial atmospheres on humans, plants, and\nanimals. For this reason, pure oxygen or oxygen-rich\natmospheres must be avoided until an adequate understanding of the effects of multigeneration exposure of\nbiological species (including microbiological candidates)\nto such atmospheres has been achieved. Obviously, the\nlength of the time delay and cost incurred in deriving\nthis level of understanding could far outweigh the anticipated benefits from the selection of such an atmosphere,\nand must be considered in any trade-off analyses. Certainly, from Apollo Project experience, it must be\nrealized that use of such atmospheres involves a significant increase in the risk of fire and imposes severe\nrestrictions on the selection of materials that can be used\nin the habitat (refs. 11-13).\nWith respect to the carbon dioxide composition, the\ncurrent maximum limit for manned spacecraft environments is 7.6 mm of Hg partial pressure with a nominal\nlevel of 5 mm of Hg. Research to date by plant\nresearchers in the controlled environments of phytotron\nchambers indicates that this carbon dioxide level is\ngreater than the maximum level of enrichment of carbon\ndioxide in terrestrial air for which plant-growth enhancement has been achieved (refs. 14 and IS). Therefore, it\ndoes not appear that different atmospheric compositions\nwill be required to satisfy the general needs of humans,\nplants, and animals. Nevertheless, the optimal level of\nCO 2 still remains to be determined.\nThe emphasis expressed above on the advantages of\nusing terrestrial air does not entirely limit considerations\nto "one standard Earth atmosphere." Stable ecologies\nexist on Earth at high-altitude locations where the total\npressure of the atmosphere is reduced to about 2/3 the\nstandard Earth atmosphere. However, the ratio of\noxygen to nitrogen is still about 20/80 (ref. 16), not\noxygen enriched. Therefore, these types of atmospheres\nalso qualify for reasonable consideration. The extent of\nthe restrictions, if any, imposed on agriculture (e .g.,\nvariety and productivity), on effects on human health\nand epidemiology, etc., should be investigated thoroughly.\nGravity Environment\nThe effects of zero-g and low-g exposure on higher\nplants and food-producing animals are not known.\nEffects on humans have been documented but not fully\nexplained. This suggests that, at a minimum, the serious\nconsideration of a gravitational environment for the\nhabitat which is other than that on Earth will add\n\nsignificantly to the needed research and development\ntime. Until adequate information can be obtained that\nensures the health and safety of the habitat\'s human\noccupants in such an environment, and the stability and\noptimal performance of its life-support system, only\nterrestrial gravity should be considered for space\nhabitats.\nIllumination\nThe general data base is probably adequate for the\nspecification of illumination requirements for humans,\nplants, and animals. However, these specifications need\nto be formulated to provide guidelines for the design of\nadequate filters or reflectors for the alteration of sunlight, to allow the use of solar illumination in space, or\ncompletely artificial illumination using solar energy as a\npower source. If the habitat must be completely shielded\nwith opaque material to eliminate the cosmic radiation\nhazard, artificial illumination would be necessary. The\nresults of extensive research show that plants grow very\nwell in artificial illumination (refs. 14, 15). Similar information on illumination requirements (e.g., periodicity,\nspectral characteristics, and intensity) that are optimum\nfor humans and food-producing animals needs to be\ncompiled.\nSpecial Constraints\nThese include area, volume and configurational (or\nshape) limits within which the life-support system must\nfunction. Several estimates of area requirements for habitat occupants and their regenerative life-support system\nhave been published (refs. 8, 9), based on different scenarios for regeneration of food. These demonstrate that\nonce the scenario has been quantitatively modeled, various configurations for the arrangement of components\nof the life-support system can be studied and area and\nvolume requirements for each can be determined. The\nprincipal focus of such analyses should be the "packing\nintensity" potential for various components of each candidate design scenario. In this manner, area, volume, and\nshape considerations become combined; otherwise the\nspecification of an area requirement alone is quite meaningless since an effective use of an available volume,\nthrough higher packing density, can reduce this area\nrequirement. Trade-offs arise, of course, in most layout\nplanning studies. For example, if plants are to be grown\nwith a higher packing density, perhaps involving vertical\nstacking, provisions for adequate illumination become\nmore complex.\n\nNevertheless, these problems probably can be\nresolved from state-of-the-art knowledge and design\nmethodology, and do not require extensive research.\nHuman social and psychological aspects of spatial planning are another matter, and these must be considered\ncarefully in habitat design. However, for the purposes of\nthis report these factors are not considered to be within\nthe domain of the regenerative life-support system,\nper se. In a sense, social and psychological factors represent components of a separate system in the habitat\nwhich share certain interfaces with the regenerative lifesupport system.\nRadiation Environment\nThe results of studies on long- and short-term radiation exposure effects show quite conclusively that living\nsystems, particularly humans and animals, must be provided with protection from ionizing radiation that is\npresent in the space environment. Effects of sublethal\noverexposure include genetic and developmental effects,\nthe production of tumors and leukemia in humans and\nanimals, and generalized life-shortening changes in the\nvascular and central nervous systems. Therefore, any\nattempts to reduce the structural weight of a habitat\ndesign must not be allowed to compromise the health\nand safety of human occupants or the stable and optimal\noperation of the regenerative life-support system by\ndecreasing the radiation shield to even a marginally\neffective thickness. Further studies will be required to\nprovide the basis for specifying adequate shielding\nrequirements for space habitats. In general, however,\nlife-support systems studies should assume that the\nradiation environment will not be different from terrestrial conditions.\nAfter several reasonable scenarios for partially or\ncompletely regenerative life-support systems have been\nformulated - based on the selection of internal interfaces, and then analyzed for sensitivity to variations in\nthe external interfaces, perturbations at the internal\ninterfaces (stability characteristics), and the reliability of\nassumptions - trade-off analyses can be performed to\nselect the most promising options for further consideration. Initially, the trade-off studies can be used to identify auspicious areas of research to improve the data base\non performance and stability characteristics. However, as\nthe data\xc2\xb7 base improves as a result of technological developments, the trade-off comparisons should be updated\nregularly. The results can provide a basis for (l) determining cost effectiveness of the research investment to\ndate; (2) redirecting future efforts; (3) predicting and\n\n9\n\ncomparing the time of readiness for use (or "technological maturity") for the various options; and (4) identifying new system-scenario options based on combinations\nof particularly attractive components or subsystems to\nform hybrid groupings.\nThis iterative procedure is strongly recommended as a\ntool to provide effective management of technologydevelopment programs in the multidisciplinary fields\nthat will contribute to the development of a successful\nregenerative life-support system for space habitats.\nMethodology already developed specifically for trade-off\nanalyses for life-support systems components\n(refs. 17, 18) can readily be adapted for the procedure\ndescribed above.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nThis report has summarized criteria for the closure of\nthe life-support system for space habitats and factors to\nbe considered when assessing the relative benefits and\ncosts of closure in comparison with nonregenerative\noptions. In addition, a methodology was specified for\nidentifying, screening, and evaluating candidate processing components for a regenerative life-support system\nthrough an iterative procedure that involves scenario\nformulation and modeling together with trade-off analyses. The procedure also includes guidelines for effectively managing the associated technology-development\nprogram. For all of the above topics of this report, it has\nbeen stressed that the limits of the present data base for\nthe relevant areas of technology preclude a priori conclusions, at this time, regarding the ultimate role that regenerative life-support systems will have as a function of\ntime in space habitats or the optimum choices to be\nmade among potential processing components to formulate an "ideal" system scenario. Therefore, the highestpriority short-term goal of future studies must be the\nidentification of key data-base needs. From there the\nlonger-term research required to satisfy these needs can\nbe specified and prioritized.\nREFERENCES\n1.

It summarizes the group\'s analyses and\nrecommendations concerning the following issues:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A preliminary review of relevant technological\nefforts to date that provide a promising basis for\nidentifying, evaluating, and developing candidate\nbiological and physicochemical processing components for regenerative life-support systems applicable to space habitats\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identification of research and development\noptions based on the above components\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Development of guidelines for establishing\nresource allocation priorities among the options\nThe 1977 Summer Study was concerned principally\nwith industrial production in space using non terrestrial\nmaterials, with housing and life support for an industrial\nwork force in space, and with space settlements per se.\nThe study planners reasoned that the earliest industrial\nactivities in space probably will depend on "open-loop"\nlife-support provisions, including resupply from Earth\nfor food with perhaps some partial regeneration of atmospheric components and water. However, beyond this\nearly transitional period, it is believed that long-term\nspace settlements will require essentially completely\nregenerative, or "closed," life-support systems (CLSS) .\nTherefore, the charter of the Life-Support Systems\n\n13\n\nGroup (LSSG) was to determine the requirements for\nachieving this closure, particularly the research that will\nbe necessary over future years.\nThe efforts of the LSSG were in cooperation with the\nBioenvironmental Systems Study Group (BSSG) of the\nSociety of Automotive Engineers, Inc. (The BSSG is\nsponsored by the Off1ce of Life Sciences, NASA Headquarters, a cosponsor of the 1977 NASA Ames Summer\nStudy.) A major chartered responsibility of the BSSG is\nto develop recommendations concerning the scope of\nNASA\'s future work in regenerative life-support systems\nfor space habitats, including the assignment of research\nand development priorities to most effectively advance\nthe associated teclmology. Our joint findings, which\nmust be regarded as interim results, are presented here\nand in a companion paper, "Systems Engineering Overview for Regenerative Life-Support Systems Applicable\nto Space Habitats." That paper summarizes criteria for\nclosure of the life-support system for space habitats and\nfactors to consider when assessing the relative benefits\nand costs of closure in comparison with nonregenerative\noptions. In addition, it specifies a methodology for identifying, screening, and evaluating candidate components\nthrough an iterative procedure that involves scenario\nformulation and modeling, together with trade-off\nanalyses.\nAs described in the companion report, there are many\nalternative components from which closed-system scenarios can be postulated. For virtually all of these alternatives, a significant amount of research would be\nrequired before any could meet the closure needs of a\npermanent space habitat. Nevertheless, certain scenarios\nmight show more promise, thereby justifying research\nemphasis over other options. Presently, the available\ndata base is not adequate to support a priori selections\nor exclusions from the possible options. In the near\nfuture, followup studies will be carried out by the BSSG.\nTherefore, the review of relevant technology, characterization of research options, and structuring of priorities\namong these options (as discussed here) are ongoing,\niterative processes.\nThe necessary provisions and accommodations\nrequired of life-support systems on manned space missions generally include adequate food, potable water,\nbreathable air, waste disposal, personal hygiene, medical\ncare, safety from identifiable hazards, and reasonable\ncomfort. For this study, the related sub topical areas of\nregenerative life-support system analysis were designated\nto be: (1) the dietary basis for human foodstuffs,\n(2) how foodstuffs are produced (e.g., grown), (3) how\nwaste products are recycled back into forms that can be\n\n14\n\nused as inputs (i.e., for food production as well as water\nand oxygen for humans), and (4) how to develop appropriate controls and protective systems to prevent crosscontamination among subsystems and to stabilize the\noperation of the system. These areas are discussed in\ndetail in subsequent sections.\nThe LSSG recognizes the fact that the development\nof a closed regenerative life-support system is an enormously complicated biological problem, particularly\nwith respect to the fundamental ecological issues that\nmust be solved. However, time constraints imposed by\nthe available work period for the 1977 Summer Study\nrequired that emphasis be placed on the analysis of\nproblems that would be essentially unique to closed\nsystems, specifically for space habitats. Certainly, the\nnumerous unknowns concerning ecological stability of\nclosed systems in general, which would be common to\nterrestrial as well as space habitats, must be addressed in\nsignificant depth before actual systems designs can be\nformulated and developed. The reader is cautioned not\nto conclude from material presented in this paper that\nsuch designs are a straightforward undertaking based on\npresent knowledge and data.\n\nBASIS FOR TECHNOLOGY REVIEW\nThe relevant technology was reviewed so as to delineate the research options. The principal steps in this\nreview procedure were: (1) to identify key technology\nareas involved in closure of a life-support system for\nspace hatitats; (2) to assess current status of applicable\ndevelopments for each area; and (3) to identify major\ntechnological issues and potential problems that must be\naddressed in each area.\nThe basis for identifying key technology areas in\nclosure is illustrated by the qualitative input-output\nmodel in figure 1 (ref. I). Generalized roles for plants\nand animals in closure linkages were assumed in the\nmodel. Figure 2 illustrates loop-closing possibilities for\ndirect and indirect connections among inputs and outputs for animal outputs and human, plant, and animal\ninputs. The direct connections between outputs and\ninputs require little biochemical or phYSicochemical prepro cessing. The preprocesses (or transformations)\nrequired for indirect connections are denoted in figure 2\nby the encircled symbols Ti. Such flow sheets for connections among all human-plant-animal inputs and outputs (prepared by the BSSG) are useful in visualizing\nmajor categories of species subsystems required to\naccomplish the transformations of indirect connections.\n\nINPUTS\n\nOUTPUTS\nFECES\nURINE\nRESPIRATORY\nPERSPI RATION\nOTHER SHEDDINGS\nCARCASS\nFLATUS, ETC.\n\nANIMAL FOOD----~\nPLANTFOOD-----~\n\nATMOSPHERE------t\nWATER: _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nHUMANS\nMINERALS _ _ _ _ _-1\n~~\n\nSUPPLEMENTS-----I\n\nFOOD\nHIDE\nFECES\nURINE\nRESPIRATORY\nPERSPIRATION\nOTHER SHEDDINGS\nCARCASS\nFLATUS, ETC.\nPROGENY\n\nWASTEFOODI-----~~\n\nPLANT FOOD - - - - - + I\nATMOSPHERE------t\nWATER\nANIMALS\nMINERALS _ _ _ _ _-1\nSUPPLEMENTS _ _ _ _- I\n\nFigure 1.- Preliminary qualitative inputoutput model for generalized closed\nlife-support system (ref. 1).\n\nANIMAL & PLANT WASTE\nFOOD\nRESPIRATORY\nSHEDDINGS\nBIOMASS BY\xc2\xb7PRODUCTS\nSEEDS OR STOCK\n\nSUBSTRATE-----~\n\nCHEMICAL NUTRIENTS\nSEEDS OR STOCK----I PLANTS\nATMOSPHERE-----I\nWATER---_ _ _- I\n\nTS\n\n~\n\n&---\n\nr--0\n\nI--FOODJ\n\n\'---WASTE FOOD ....\n\nl\'\n\n-@-\n\nWASTE\nORGANICS\n\nWATER\n\nI--FECES-\n\nSALT\n\n-URINE\n\nMINERALS ....\n\nT3\n\n-EXHALED GAS.--.-i\n\n~ATM.\nH 2O\n\n-ATMOSPHERE-+\n\nANIMALS\n\n--WATER-+\n\n-PERSPIRATION\n\nT\n\n-FLATUS\n-CARCASS\n-HIDE\n\nUREA\n\n1\n\nI--SHEDDINGS~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-@--\n\nI--PROGENYi\n\n~1-""~,,,oo8\n~ATM.\nH2O\n\nMINERALS\n- - - ATMOSPHERE\n\nHUMANS\n\nWATER\n\n\'----RAW ANIMAL WASTE\'"\nL..-4--PROCESSED ANIMAL WASTE_\n,-----CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS_\n\nPLANTS\n\nATMOSPHERE\'"\nWATER ...\n\nFigure 2.- Example loop-closing flow sheet for generalized closed life-support system (ref. 1).\n\n15\n\nThe perceived knowledge and the technological development needs for the major categories of species are discussed in the following sections as the basis for eventual\ncomparison and evaluation of candidate components of\na closed system.\n\nNUTRITION, DIET, AND FOOD PROCESSING\nDiet Selection\nThe first criterion for a successful diet is that it\nprovide all nutrients necessary for long-term maintenance of health and work efficiency. Diet determines the\nagriculture inputs which then flow through the food\nsystem, as shown in figure 3. At present, there is no\ncertainty that all necessary components of a human diet\nhave been identified (ref. 2). It is likely that unrecognized nutrients are contained in the mixed plant and\nanimal diets that have evolved culturally among Earth\npopulations. As engineered foods from a narrow range of\nplant and animal products are being substituted increasingly into a diet that lacks natural diversity, the danger\nof missing some trace element or an unidentified\nnutrient also increases. Thus, the development of diet\nfor closed life-support systems must include long-term\nevaluation of proposed diets that are significantly different from conventional established diet patterns.\n\nNutritional requirements for CLSS could differ from\nthose of similar terrestrial populations. Construction\nwork might proceed in zero gravity (i.e., extravehicular\nor extrahabitat activity), and even leisure hours might be\nspent in only some fraction of full gravity. Therefore, it\nis of concern that crewmen on long-duration missions\nsuch as Skylab showed losses of body mass, water,\ncalcium, and electrolytes, continuing even after months\nin space (refs. 3,4). More research under space conditions is necessary to establish whether changes can be\nnormalized by compensatory diet adjustments. Precise\ninformation is needed on the individual daily requirements of nutrients for space-habitat personnel before an\nentirely adequate selection can be made of basic sources\nof these nutrients. These sources of foodstuffs must be\nknown before the sophisticated existing technology of\nfood processing can be fully utilized to optimize CLSS\ndevelopment.\nIn anticipating the foods necessary for adequate\nnutrition, attention must be given to the criteria used to\nevaluate the complexity of diet that will be acceptable\nfor various periods of time. This is because it can be\nassumed that the longer the period of habitation in space\nthe more complex will be the dietary requirements. Even\nin traditional military environments, dietary changes are\na major psychological factor. Eating preferences show\nthe need for individual flexibility in diet selection as\ntastes become jaded and preferences shift (ref. 5).\nFood Processing\n\n- - - RAW AGRICULTURAL INPUT\nPROCESSED (NOT PREPARED)\n\nI\n\nr-l\nI\nI\nI\n\nAGRICULTURAL INPUT\n\nPROCESSING\n\n.~\n\nPREPARATION\n\n_.

Processing converts raw materials into a\nvariety of individual ingredients of cuisine, such as the\nmany forms of corn from starch, to meal, to fresh-onthe-cob corn, as in the American diet. Also, processing\ncan produce analogs of traditional ingredients from new\nmaterials (e,g., the various "synthetic" products of texturized soy protein). Similarly, nonconventional protein\nsources such as leaf-protein concentrate, yeast, etc., may\nbe incorporated into the diet through processing into\nsubstitutes for traditional food forms (ref. 6). The processes required for such new food sources must be\nselected and developed, and their complications of\nacceptance weighed against the probiems in expanded\nagricultural complexity. As new food sources are incorporated into the diet, research is needed to consider the\nlong-term medical and nutritional tolerances.\nThe conventional technology of food processing has,\nof course, been developed under terrestrial conditions\n\n(ref. 7). Conditions of gravity, atmospheric composition,\nand Coriolis force can affect the heat- and mass-transfer\nprocesses required to process and store food. Research\non specific problems is necessary to anticipate and minimize the need for redesign of processing equipment.\nFurthermore, the existing processing technology must be\nadapted to the specific space habitat conditions.\nIndustrial Support for Food-Processing Industry\nEven if a minimal food-processing option is selected\nfor space settlements, there will be demands to provide\nsolvents, salts, emulsifiers, bleaching agents, antioxidants\n(for contingency storage requirements), and other chemicals to process raw agricultural products into usable\nfoods (ref. 8). Without an in situ "chemical industry,"\nmany standard food-processing chemicals such as the\norganic solvents used to extract soybeans will not be\navailable to a CLSS operation. Alternative methods for\nsupplying or eliminating the need for these chemicals\nmust be evaluated. The effects these food-processing\nalternatives have on the nutritional value of the resulting\nfoods must also be evaluated (ref. 9).\n\nallow individuals to "cook"; that is, to choose from\nprepared or partially-prepared alternatives.\nOn Earth, there is renewed interest in water-saving\nand energy-saving methods of preparation because of\nvarious shortages. Research programs in these areas\ncould be doubly rewarding if planning and design are\ninitiated early. It is essential that food-preparation concepts that are deemed potentially appropriate for space\nuse be tested in space environments since those conditions may affect heating, mixing, etc.\n\nMicronutrients and Mineral Toxicity\nIn closed systems, there exists an added danger\nregarding control of various elements in metabolism.\nSince human requirements for trace minerals have not\nbeen adequately determined on Earth, and there is often\na narrow tolerance between minimum requirement and\ntoxicity, the artificial levels available in a space habitat\nmight be critically difficult to adjust. A better grasp of\nrequirements and tolerances, and an efficient monitoring\nsystem for metals such as copper, chromium, zinc, and\ncobalt, will be required.\n\nFood Preparation\nTerrestrial experience in food service shows that processing, packaging, preparation, and waste disposal\nstreams must all be matched for efficient operation. The\nextreme efficiency of some types of fast-food service\n(e.g., "hamburger-fries-shake" meals) suggests possible\nbenefits in CLSS development. Cafeteria vs home cooking vs vending systems should be considered. Equipment\ninventory and layout, especially if spatial conservation is\nimportant, must be tailored to specific scenarios. Diet\nmodifications, methods of processing, and feeding patterns will have important effects on optimal storage,\nheating, dispensing, and equipment maintenance. A\nmajor problem of present-day food service industries is\nthe lack of adequate equipment for intermediate-sized\noperations, that is, for 1000 to 10,000 people. Hence,\nmethodology that will minimize spatial requirements for\nfeeding a self-contained group of people must be developed (ref. 10).\nThe size and permanence of the cooking staff are also\naffected by the food-service component of a given scenario. If it is determined that, for sound psychological\nreasons, the concept of choice and the principles of\nvariation and change should be built into a system from\nthe beginning, one way to generate these options is to\n\nResearch and Development Options\nNutritional research and development should follow\nthese steps:\n1. Develop diet scenarios of several types and analyze\nthem for nutritional adequacy, suitability to the space\nenvironment, and acceptability to the expected inhabitants.\n2. Test these diets on animals in multigenerational\nexperiments under conditions closely simulating space\nenvironments, and with humans in short-term studies in\nactual space environments, as well as in longer-term\nstudies on Earth.\n3. Reevaluate diets on the basis of data developed in\nstep 2 and retest as necessary, preferably with humans\nunder space-habitat conditions.\n4. All of the above studies must be in close interaction with analysis of the processing, storage, and distribution capabilities of the space settlement.\n5. It may be necessary to accomplish step 1 and\nproceed to step 2 in order to develop new information\non trace nutrients and trace toxicants (e.g., mineral\nrequirements, tolerable levels of recycled heavy metals,\nand special requirements of stress conditions).\n\n17\n\n6. Continue the investigation of various protein\nresources from nonconventional substrates, with attention to extraction, detoxification, acceptance, and longterm tolerance by humans and/or agricultural animals.\n7. In reviewing the various candidate diet scenarios\nfor use in space habitats, consider the complexity and\navailability of suitable processing technology rcquired to\ntransform raw food-source products into acceptable\nfood for humans.\n8. Since schemes used in the United States for largescale processing will most likely be unsuitable for CLSS,\ndevelop processing methods, equipment, and procedures\nthat are adapted specifically for CLSS needs. These\nschemes should be tested under simulated (or actual)\nspace-environment conditions.\n9. Solve specific problems to minimize the need for\nsubsequent redesign; for example, the effect of Coriolis\nforce on heat and mass transfer and on fluid flow in\nequipment, the best use of the available space vacuum,\nand the effects of a lowered boiling point (in cases of\nreduced atmospheric pressure in the habitat).\n10. Analyze the storage and distribution requirements\nof each proposed system scenario and consider needs for\npreservation, protective packaging, and the special storage environment, including inventory and rotation\nsystems.\n11. Adapt preservation methods specifically to CLSS\nrequirements and the types of food to be processed. The\nsame considerations that apply to the development of\nprocessing methods will apply to preservation and storage. For example, special problems to consider include\ndifferent microflora, different entomological hazards,\navailability of free vacuum for freeze-drying, sunlight,\nfree refrigeration on the dark side, and different heating\nsituations.\n12. Analyze the food system, developed and tested\nabove, for its effect on the habitat (e.g., noise,\ng-location, chemical and odor emanations, ease of distribution, energy and water requirements, and nutrient\nlosses).\n13. After this analysis, develop and retest the most\npromising processing systems.\n\nHIGHER PLANT AGRICULTURE\nPlant agriculture is included as an important option in\nplanning CLSS because the photosynthetic process is a\nconventional means of closing the life-support system.\nPhotosynthesis recycles carbon dioxide, produced by\nhuman metabolism, back into organic constituents\n\n18\n\nnecessary for human nutrition and into oxygen necessary for respiration. However, in considering plant agriculture as an integral component of a CLSS, it must be\nrecognized that higher plants are a complex and environmentally responsive system. With their thousands of\ninterdependent physiological and morphological processes, they lack the engineered reliability of mechanical\nand physicochemical systems. Since higher plants are\nalready being grown in con trolled environments with\nboth natural and artificial light, although not in a completely closed system, it can be assumed that the minimum technology for intensive plant culture already\nexists. However, as evidenced by the variability of\nreported growth and yields (as illustrated in table 1),\nthere is little consistency in productivity. If the demands\nof a human population can be sustained by higher plant\nagriculture in a CLSS, then research and development\nemphasis must center on the technology and tolerable\nenvironmental limits for reliable production.\nPlant growth occurs as a result of the processes of cell\ndivision and cell differentiation in the various meristematic centers and apices of the plant, and the capacity\nfor production and translocation of photosynthetic\nproducts to support the expansion of these cells. The\nmorphological and physiological processes are interactively influenced by such environmental parameters as\ntemperature, quality and quantity of light, availability of\nwater and mineral nutrients, atmospheric concentrations\nof carbon dioxide, oxygen, water vapor, gaseous pollutants, and the pres.:nce of certain toxic metal ions in\nthe plant environment (ref. 11). If the technology of\ncrop productivity is to be advanced to the state of\nreliability required for inclusion of higher plant agriculture in a CLSS, the morphological and physiological\nresponses to all combinations of the environmental\nparameters must be precisely documented. This is an\nextensive task when one considers that the magnitude\nand nature of the responses change with plant age and\nspecies.\n\nSimulator Development\nThe only practical means of approaching this technological competence in assessing and predicting plant\nresponses is to develop comprehensive mathematical\nmodels, which would be based on known physiological\nand morphological principles and would describe environmentally and genetically induced changes in plant\ngrowth and development. Modeling would be coordinated with selective experimentation so that the model\n\nTABLE 1.- VARIABILITY OF GROWTH AND YIELD DATA\n\nSpecies\n\nReference\n\nEdible\nharvest,\ng_m""\'2\n\nTotal\nharvest,\ng_m"""2\n\nAverage\ngrowth rate,\ng-m"""2day-l\n\nGrowth\nperiod,\ndays\n\nEdible\nCucumbers\n\ncva\nSoybeans\n\n23\n18\n\n397\n2850\n107\n\n2259\n4350\n45\n\n90\n120\n20\n\n4.4\n23.8\n97\n\n25.1\n36.3\n26\n\n21\n\n446\n1000\n642\n40\n\n1035\n2300\n1689\n38\n\n120\n116\n143\n12\n\n3.7\n8.6\n4.5\n47\n\n8.6\n19.8\n11.8\n43\n\n21\n11\n12\n\n431\n601\n1273\n58\n\n1435\n2360\n4999\n63\n\n100\n63\n104\n25\n\n4.3\n9.5\n12.2\n46\n\n14.4\n37.5\n48.1\n52\n\n12\n18\n\n1328\n1034\n18\n56\n\n1696\n1320\n18\n41\n\n215\n180\n13\n18\n\n6.2\n5.7\n6\n49\n\n7.9\n7.3\n6\n32\n\n22\n22\nCV\nWheat\n\nCV\nTomatoes\n\nCVmean\n\nTotal\n\naCoefficient of variation, in percenL\n\ncould be adj usted to simulate the growth of various crop\nspecies.\nThe development of a dynamic crop simulator is\nrecommended for four reasons. First, it establishes a\npriority for experimental determination of plant\nresponses to environment. The parameters of photosynthetically active radiance (PAR) and temperature form\nthe basis of net carbon fixation; other environmental\nparameters are then incorporated as regulators of photosynthetic production and partitioning. Second, because\npredictive ability can be enhanced as the simulator is\ndeveloped, experimental combinations of environmental\nvariables can be truncated to the few levels necessary to\nestablish and verify a response surface. Similar truncation of environmental combinations are possible for each\nnew growth stage and each species adapted to the\ndynamic simulator. Third, on a longer-term basis, as the\nsensitivity of the crop simulator is increased by experimentation, it can become a feed-forward interactive\nsystem for controlling the plant environment. Thus,\nwhen coupled with the environmental and plantmonitoring system, the crop simulator can project final\n\nyield from attained growth and suggest down-the-line\nenvironmental alternatives to optimize yield. The fundamental logic for such dynamic plant growth models is\nalready being developed (refs. 12-14), including at least\none model capable of multiple crop simulation (ref. 14).\nFinally, the crop simulator will possess the accuracy\nneeded for final reiterations of whatever input-output\nmodel is used for sensitivity studies in developing the\nultimate CLSS.\n\nData-Base Requirements\nCrop simulators can only be as precise as the data\nbase underlying their developmenL Systematic data collection at frequent intervals during plant growth is\nrequired\xc2\xb7 to adapt a crop species to the model. These\ndata must include: (1) accurate monitoring of the physical and chemical environment, (2) detailed plant chemical analysis of inorganic nutrients and organic plant\nconstituents of physiological importance, and (3) thorough descriptions of plant morphological development\n\n19\n\nas functions of selected changes in environmental parameters. Such data sets, although being developed for a few\ncrop species (refs. 15,16), are not available in the literature. However, the controlled-environment research\nfacilities required to generate an adequate data base for\nthe crop simulator are available at the phytotron units of\nthe Southeastern Plant Environment Laboratories at\nDuke University and North Carolina State University\n(ref. 17), the Environmental Research Laboratory at the\nUniversity of Arizona (ref. 18), and the Biotron at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin. Utilization of these existing\nfacilities for fundamental research into plant growth\ndynamics can greatly expedite the development of a\nprototype crop simulator. They can also be used to\ndevelop cultural and nutrient delivery systems (aeroponics, artificial substrates, etc.) for higher plant agriculture in the CLSS.\n\nDevelopment of Completely Closed Facilities\nThe existing controlled-environment facilities are\nopen systems in which some portion of the conditioned\natmosphere is continually replaced from external\nsources. Hence, they do not have the capacity for\nresearch to address three critical questions about the\ntolerance limits of adapting higher plants to a CLSS for\nspace habitats. The first of these questions concerns the\nlong-term tolerance of higher plants to low gravity.\nThere is no available research on the long-term response\nof plants to true low-gravity conditions; hence priority\nmust be given to include on the earliest possible longduration orbiting mission carefully controlled experiments to determine physiological and morphological\neffects of low gravity. (All effects of low gravity are not\nnecessarily deleterious since a reduced gravitational force\non plants may reduce the proportion of nonedible structural biomass.) Meanwhile, attention in terrestrial facilities should be given to the study of proposed hormonal\ninvolvement in geotropic responsiveness of plants\n(ref. \\9) to develop chemical or genetical means for\ncounteracting the deleterious effects of low gravity. A\nsecond limitation of existing controlled-environment\nfacilities is an inability for long-term regulation of composition of the atmosphere, including toxicants, and\nchanges in atmospheric pressure. Tolerance limits for\nboth environmental parameters must be determined.\nSpecial growth rooms must be designed and built for\nsuch experimentation. A third concern is the tolerance\nlevel of plants to ionizing radiation. Although plants\n\n20\n\nmay have a greater tolerance than humans or animals,\nthe long-term effects and resulting requirements for\nshielding must be determined in experiments in space\nenvironments.\nLighting for plants is viewed as a more critical\nresearch problem if natural, rather than artificial light is\nused as the source. Comparisons of growth over\nextended periods (ref. 20) have shown little difference\nbetween natural light, which had a mean daily PAR of\n42 Einsteins 01 2 day-I, and artificial light supplied at\nfluxes above 17 Einsteins m- 2 day-I. Furthermore, plants\nhave been grown for several generations with artificial\nlight sources (ref. 21) with no measurable effects on\ngrowth. Hence, the use of artificial light for plant growth\nappears to pose no serious or unknown constraints on\ncrop productivity.\nOn the other hand, utilization of natural radiation\nwith spectral characteristics unattenuated by the Earth\'s\natmosphere poses questions of possible adverse or mutagenic effects on plants beyond the limits of current\npredictability. In addition, use of natural light poses\nproblems of photoperiodic control necessary for reproductive development of some plant species (ref. 22).\nHowever, problems associated with the use of solar\nradiation in space may possibly be circumvented by the\nuse of spectral shift and selective transmission of glazings\nto provide filtered light that approximates Earth radiation. If glazings are used, control of day length for\nphotoperiodically responsive crops can be provided by a\nsystem of shutters.\nA final question that must be resolved before higher\nplant agriculture can be included as an integral part of\nthe CLSS is whether the plant agricultural system can\nmaintain a specified level of productivity over long\nperiods of time and several generations of plant culture.\nAn Earth-based model CLSS should be established as a\nfinal feasibility study in which all elements of the CLSS\nare present, and in which reliability of productivity and\nthe interactive crop-environment simulator can be evaluated for several years.\nA model evaluation of a CLSS, including linked man\nand plant systems, was attempted in BIOS-3 by the\nUSSR on a modest scale (ref. 23). They reported deterioration of crop productivity over a 6-month test, but\nbecause of their failure to adequately evaluate tolerance\nlimits of plants to changes in the environment, they were\nunable to diagnose the cause of the partial failure. However, the USSR experience underscores the necessity of a\nmodel evaluation of closure in a life-support system.\n\nNovel Concepts\n\ncarefully controlled and coordinated so that they can be\nintegrated into the terrestrial technology base.\n\nIn parallel with a critical evaluation of a CLSS, other\nresearch should be undertaken to broaden the options in\nthe ultimate system. This research should include novel\nconcepts such as cultural or biochemical manipulation of\nplant growth to idealize the plant phenotype of CLSS\nagriculture. Crop plants possess a certain range of morphological plasticity that potentially can be used to\nbreed plants with a more favorable ratio of edible/total\nbiomass in the stable environments of a CLSS (ref. 21).\nSimilarly, manipulation of environmental factors such as\ntemperature, photoperiod, and partial pressure of\noxygen during certain stages of plant development can\nshift the ratio of total/edible biomass (ref. 22). The\nenvironment not only affects the growth and development of the concurrent generation, but also can affect\nthe viability of the seeds and thus that of several subsequent generations (refs. 24, 25).\nHence, the environmental requirements for plant\npropagation (e.g., seed production) must be considered\nseparate from the environmental requirements for foodcrop production. Since traditional agriculture has been\ndeveloped within the constraints of a virtually nonmanipulable environment, the flexibilities of the plant\nsystem for optimization in controlled-environment agriculture have neither been emphasized nor extensively\nexploited.\n\nOther pertinent options for research and development\nare:\n1. Systematic determination of detailed changes in\nplant morphology and chemical composition due to variations in individually-controlled environmental\nvariables.\n2. Use of these data to develop a dynamic crop\nsimulator model with multiple crop capacity and feedforward interactive capabilities for optimizing the plant\nenvironment.\n3. Evaluation of cultural and genetical manipulation\nto idealize plant phenotypes for CLSS agriculture.\n4. Determination of specific environmental requirements for seed production which may be distinct from\nrequirements for edible yield.\n5. Development of an Earth-based model CLSS for a\nfinal evaluation of the feasibility and reliability of higher\nplant agriculture in a closed system.\n\nResearch and Development Options\nConsiderable information is being gathered on the\neffects of environmental systems on higher plant growth\nand development. However, this research has been conducted within the context of terrestrial agricultural\nproblems. Before the technological base and experimental systems can be applied to developmental problems in\nadapting higher plant agriculture to CLSS, three specific\nresearch requirements must be considered: (1) What are\nthe tolerance limits of higher plants to reduced gravity\nand can the possible effects be countered by biochemical\nmanipulation? (2) What are the tolerance limits of higher\nplants to lower atmospheric pressures and gaseous compositions different from those normally encountered in\nterrestrial systems? (3) What are the tolerance limits of\nhigher plants to ionizing radiation and what amount of\nshielding is required for growth?\nResearch and development to resolve these questions\nare critical to a determination of the feasibility of\nincluding higher plant agriculture as an integral part of\nthe CLSS. The design of such experiments should be\n\nANIMAL AGRICULTURE\nThere is some question concerning the need for a\nlivestock component in a CLSS. This fundamental consideration relates to many aspects of CLSS design such\nas mass, area, and volume requirements, waste and atmospheric recycling, epidemiology, and nutritional\nadequacy of the diet provided for humans.\nThe question is difficult to resolve because of the\ncomplexity of the trade-offs involved. Several design\nstudies have shown that the inclusion of animals in the\nfood-production subsystem of a CLSS will increase area\nrequirements substantially. Questions have been raised\nabout the additional complexity of the total system, the\nneed to provide additional plant-growing area for feed\nand forage production and special areas for animal production, as well as the processing and storage requirements for animal products. The use of animals in a CLSS\nwill also place additional burdens on the waste recycling\nand atmospheric regeneration systems. In particular,\ngrave concern has been expressed concerning the additional risk involved in using animals that may serve as\nvectors for human pathogenic organisms.\nThe primary justifications for including animals in a\nCLSS appear to be their nutritional value, dietary variety\nfor humans, and the possibility that animal components\nwill result in a more balanced, stable ecosystem with\nenhanced closure characteristics. Animal products do\nprovide high-quality protein in a very acceptable form.\n\n21\n\nIn addition, milk and milk products provide most of the\nessential minerals, such as calcium, in American diets.\nSince some animal production is possible by feeding\nthem by-products and plant residues from plants grown\nfor human consumption, limited meat and milk may be\nmade available without additional plant agricultural\nrequirements. The extent to which additional animal\nproducts should be included in the diet will be determined by the balance between the esthetic and nutritional value of these products and the cost in terms of\nplant-growth requirements to produce any additional\nfeed required, spatial and equipment requirements for\nanimal culture, etc.\n\nRuminants\nThe primary animal type most suited for converting\ninedible plant material into animal products will be\nruminants; that is, dairy cows for milk production and\nadditional cattle for meat. Swine, chickens, and turkeys\ncan be fed partially from table scraps and noncellulosic\nplant by-products, but most feed consumed by these\nanimals could also be consumed directly by humans (i.e.,\ncompetitive consumption).\nCellulosic materials such as plant roots, tops, brans,\nand hulls, can only be effectively used by ruminants.\nMicroorganisms in the rumen of these animals allow\nthem to digest these fibrous materials and convert them\ninto fatty acids that are absorbed as a primary source of\nenergy for their metabolism. Although the digestion\nprocesses are similar for both dairy and beef animals, the\noverall efficiency of converting feed energy into milk\nenergy is several times greater than feed to beef because\nof the high rate of daily production possible (ref. 26).\nThe efficiency of both dairy and beef animals is\ninfluenced most by voluntary food intake and by the\ndigestibility of the diet. Because of the intense production rate that would be required by agriculture in a\nCLSS, these factors will become increasingly important.\nIncreasing from 45 to 75 percent the digestibility of\nplant residues that are high in lignin and structural\ncarbohydrates can reduce by 40 percent the amount of\nfeed required per unit of milk produced. Of even greater\nconsequence is the concomitant reduction of 73 percent\nin undigested animal waste voided. Improved digestibility would also permit substantially increased voluntary\nintake with a resulting gain in gross efficiency (e.g.,\nincreasing the intake of a growing steer from 5.0 to\n7.2 kg/day would double the rate of edible meat\nproduced).\n\n22\n\nThe removal of constraints on voluntary feed intake\nand rate and extent of digestion of cellulosic materials\nhas high priority in the development of an animal agriculture compatible with the requirements of the space\nsettlement.\n\nAquatic animal resources- As suggested, the animal\ncomponent in space agriculture may perform the functions of a biological recycling agent, converting a portion\nof useless plant wastes to useful protein and releasing the\nremaining plant material as egesta. The egesta from the\nterrestrial animal component of a CLSS must be\nrecycled eventually to plant nutrients and carbon\ndioxide in order to regenerate the food-production\ncycle. The same process must be performed for unconsumed plant material and for human wastes. Conventionally, this recycling can be accomplished by the use\nof some form of physicochemical oxidation process.\nAnother potential option exists, however, to further\naugment protein production in a CLSS by incorporating\nan aquatic production process as a supplementary\norganic recycling system to handle a portion of the\nwastes generated by humans, animals, and plants.\nAquatic recycling processes have been the subject of\nconsiderable research effort in recent years\n(refs. 27-30). This research has demonstrated that such\nprocesses can purify effluents to acceptable standards\nwhile producing valuable, high-protein biomass as a\nby-product. The possible role of aquatic processes for\nfood production and waste recycling in space applications merits additional investigation.\nSmall-animal resources- The possible role of small\nanimals for food production in space settlements should\nbe examined. In many ways, they offer substantial production advantages over the large ruminants. Some small\nanimals that should be considered include milk goats,\nrabbits, ducks, and geese.\nSmall animals have an advantage in production\nsystems because they reproduce more often and reach\nmaturity more quickly. They have a more efficient overall feed/protein conversion ratio because they are maintained only through the exponential growth phase;\ntherefore less biomass is used in maintenance. For many\nsmall animals, feed requirements need only be margin\xc2\xb7\nally competitive with the human diet, consisting\npredominantly of table scraps, vegetable by-products,\nand small supplements of grain or forage. Lastly, smallanimal production components may enhance the safety,\nstability, and reliability by increasing the species diversity of any animal production subsystem.\n\nEpidemiology\nDiseases of domestic animals are an important consideration because they may dramatically disrupt the foodproduction process. Also, in some instances, there exists\na direct danger to the human population from disease\norganisms that may infect both human and animal hosts.\nTerrestrial experience in high-density, confined animal\nhusbandry has documented the need to consider epidemiology and to safeguard animal populations by appropriate sanitation and disease-control measures. At times,\nthe routine administration of antibiotics is recommended. Procedures and facilities should be designed to\nisolate disease outbreaks. All livestock products must be\nroutinely inspected to ensure their safety for human\nconsumption.\n\nResearch and Development Options\nThe currently recognized limitations to the use of\ntotal available plant material by animals must be\nremoved. Voluntary intake of some residues may be\nlimited by use of chemical components that reduce\npalatability. To remove this limitation:\n1. Identify the chemical compounds in specific feed\nplants, and develop techniques for removing or masking\nthese compounds. Voluntary intake and nutritive value\nof residue plant materials are limited by structural carbohydrates that decrease the rate and extent of microbial\ndegradation in the digestive tract of ruminant animals.\n2. Identify plants according to their readily fermentable residue materials and also develop techniques for\nthe appropriate physicochemical treatment of resistant\nresidue materials (e.g., lignin) that limit the rate of\ndegradation.\n3. Examine rumen bacteria for criteria that govern\nthe degradation rate of cellulose and other structural\ncarbohydrates; if applicable, develop methods for providing the rumen bacteria with supplemental minerals\nand nitrogen sources to achieve maximal fermentation\nrates.\n4. Improve food-production efficiency by reducing\nthe ratio of fat/edible carcass; to accomplish this objective, identify the physiological mechanism that regulates\nthe rate of protein deposition.\nS. Examine the management factors and feed additives for their true relationship to the composition and\nrate gain in the growing animal.\n\n6. Identify the potentially toxic and organoleptically\nundesirable compounds that exist in residues of some\nplants grown for human consumption.\n7. Undertake a detailed chemical analysis (i.e.,\nnutrient composition) of candidate plants for CLSS\ngrowing conditions for both human and animal diets.\n8. Explore some unknown aspects of intense animal\nproduction in a CLSS.\n9. Identify the volatile compounds that will accumulate; examine them for their effect on the humans and\nanimals, and remove them by some appropriately developed method.\n10. Develop a minimum-volume system for animal\nproduction. To accomplish this task, minimum-volume\nrequirements must be established, including minimum\nlevels of animal exercise required for efficient breeding\nand milking stock.\n11. Develop adequate health management methods\nto prevent epidemics and catastrophic diseases in CLSS\nanimal agriculture.\n12. Collate and compare data from currently available resources to evaluate the potential of animal agriculture in a CLSS.\n13. Quantify table wastes and food-processing\nby-products, which would be quite acceptable as animal\nfeed; delineate fish culture, which is another viable\noption in a CLSS (ref. 31).\n14. Study poultry excreta as a nitrogen source for\nruminants before consideration for a CLSS.\n15. Analyze more thoroughly the specific nutrient\nrequirements of animals in a CLSS to prevent potential\nnutritional problems.\n16. Describe specific plants to be used as feed\nsources for animal production on the basis of total\ndigestible mass per unit weight of plant growth\nresources; consider the processing requirements of these\nplants for feed, with special reference to CLSS labor and\nmanagement procedures.\n17. Evaluate the advantages of using small animals\nsuch as milk goats, rabbits, and poultry; they have possible competitive advantages over cattle for milk and\nmeat production from vegetable wastes and by-products\n(i.e., noncompetitive with humans).\n18. Review current literature and experience with\naquatic waste recycling to determine its potential relevance to food production and waste recycling for CLSS;\nconsider aquatic microcosms as a possible research tool\nfor exploring the most promising aquatic recycling/foodproduction systems.\n\n23\n\nWASTE CONVERSION AND RESOURCE\nRECOVERY\nThe primary objectives of waste processing in a\nrecycling life-support system are to remove waste materials before they build up to toxic levels and to convert\nthem into life-sustaining inputs. In a CLSS, the gaseous,\nsolid, and liquid outputs of food-producing and processing operations must be dealt with in addition to human\nwastes. Waste can be processed using physicochemical\ntechniques, by bioregeneration, or by some combination\nof these two approaches.\n\nCurrent Physicochemical Alternatives\nAmong waste management concepts, the following\nare relevant to current research objectives.\nWater reclamation technology deals primarily with\nthe processing of lightly contaminated water (humidity\nor condensate, wash water) or highly contaminated\nwater (urine, fecal water). Ongoing research and development activities are focusing on improved reliability of\nthese processes.\nHandling and either storing or treating solid wastes\n(food waste, wet waste, and fecal matter) probably will\nrequire extensive research and development effort. Four\nprocessing approaches have been investigated to date for\nmanned spacecraft (ref. 32). One is a dehydration process using space vacuum to achieve a dried, stabilized\nmass. This method was adapted for use on Sky lab and is\nbeing developed for the Space Shuttle. The other three\napproaches involve oxidation. Two of these combine\nconcentrated waste water with solid wastes, the wet\noxidation (ref. 33) and the RITE process (ref. 34),\nrespectively. Wet oxidation uscs an aqueous slurry contacted with oxygen at elevated temperatures and pressures to produce a stabilized sterile ash and sterile water\nthat requires further treatment. RITE combines solid\nwaste and liquid residues and processes the evaporated\nwater (vapor) by catalytic oxidation. The remaining\nsolid wastes are then pyrolized, incinerated, and their\ngases removed (for subsequent processing), leaving a\nsterile solid ash. The other oxidative process involves dry\nincineration of solid waste which produces a sterile ash\nafter pyrolysis and subsequent oxidation of its vapors\n(ref. 35).\nAny oxidative process offers potentially feasible\napproaches to solid-waste management. Each has been\noperated in the batch mode, but the problems of transporting wastes to the processing units for a continuous\n\n24\n\noperation have not been solved. Significant data are\nlacking on the design and performance of catalytic oxidation units (ref. 32). In addition, applications in CLSS\nwill require specific processes for the selective removal\nand separation of mineral constituents in the solid-ash\nresidue from the oxidation of the wastes. These minerals\nare vital nutrient components for humans, plants, and\nanimals, and they must be made available in acceptable\nform as input constituents.\nBiological Alternatives\nIn addition to the physicochemical methods reviewed\npreviously, there are various bioregenerative systems that\nuse microorganisms, aquatic vascular plants, aquatic animals, and other organisms either singly or in combination (cf. section on Animal Agriculture). This area of\ntechnology has received very little research attention for\nspacecraft applications. Most of the technological developments to date are the products of research and applicational practice relating to municipal waste processing.\nThere is an enormously large body of literature that\nmust be screened eventually to identify any approaches\nthat might offer options feasible for use in CLSS\napplications.\n\nResearch and Development Options\nThe design of waste processing components for CLSS\napplications must be integrated with the design of the\nentire life-support system because it must interface with\nother components and subsystems to satisfy a complex,\ninterrelated set of input and output requirements\n(fig. 2). In general, however, the following options now\nseem to be key data-base expanders that can provide an\nimportant basis for the identification, design, and development of appropriate concepts.\n1. Characterize the average and range of composition\nof gaseous, liquid and solid wastes, and their amounts,\nthat are likely to occur in realistic CLSS scenarios, as a\nbasis for specifying the inputs to waste processors.\n2. Develop methods for effectively and efficiently\nconverting these wastes into useful inputs for the other\nCLSS components. Specifically evaluate the relative\nattractiveness of physicochemical and biological processing techn\'iques, and processes for the selective recovery\nfor reuse of mineral constituents.\n3. Give particular attention to the problem of trace\nelements that may become concentrated to toxic levels\nbecause of the waste recycling process; establish levels of\n\ntolerability and toxicity for all living components of the\nCLSS.\n4. Develop methods for monitoring and controlling\nall phases of waste collection and treatment.\n\nSYSTEM STABILITY AND SAFETY\nResearch options associated with system stability and\nsafety must emphasize those areas of contamination,\nsafety, health, and reliability that are uniquely associated with the design and environmental features of\nCLSS scenarios; for example, confinement with minimum ecological buffering against hazards. Various possible areas of concern, from which research options\nmight be derived, and a preliminary list of options that\nshould be given further consideration during the early\nphases of CLSS scenario analysis, are discussed below.\nMicrobiology\nThe microbial component of the habitat can reside in\nseveral areas: humans, agriculture, water supply, food\nsubsystems, atmosphere, waste processors, and some\nstructural materials of the habitat. The relationships\namong these are very complex and interdependent.\nThese components form inescapable elements of the\necosystem in the form of pathogens, symbionts, and\ncommensals with humans, plants, and domestic animals.\nCompared to terrestrial plant, animal, and soil ecosystems, the habitat will provide a simplified, largely\nsynthetic environment. New biological relationships will\nundoubtedly form. Also, in new or drastically altered\nenvironments, biological change is likely to be abrupt,\ndramatic, and unpredictable (ref. 36).\nHuman, animal, and plant pathogens can, in part, be\ncontrolled in the habitat by the conventional techniques\nof quarantine, screening for carriers, and immunization.\nHowever, some diseases are so common and the carriers\nso difficult to identify that exclusion from the habitat\nmay not be possible. Soviet investigators observed major\nmicrobial changes in enclosed ecosystems intended to\nprovide human life support (ref. 23). Species composition and population numbers changed throughout the\ntime these simulations were in operation and possibly\ndegraded the performance of some components in the\nsystems. Habitat design may involve problems similar to\nthose encountered in hospital design, but with contamination problems intensified by the impossibility of\nbringing in "outside" air from a huge external pool and\nusing it as a sink for contaminants. Rigorous microbio-\n\nlogical security of the water supply will also be necessary\nbecause of the ease with which organisms can reproduce\nin the aquatic environment and the readiness with which\nthey might be transmitted (refs. 23, 37,38).\nOne of the most common methods of microbial control is the use of chemical biocides (e.g., chlorine in\nwater supplies, bacteriocides, fungicides, and algacides in\nindustrial plumbing and tankage, pesticides in agriculture, chemical disinfectants in hospitals and homes, and\npreservatives in foods). However, the hazards associated\nwith the use of any toxic substance in the space habitat\nmust be thoroughly understood before its application\ncan be rationally contemplated.\nToxic Chemicals\nThe fragile, synthetic environment of a habitat will\nprobably be highly sensitive to a large array of hazardous\norganic and inorganic compounds. Since habitats will\nnot have large areas of sediments or volumes of atmosphere to dilute toxic compounds, special measures must\nbe taken to avoid environmental contamination. These\nmeasures may include prohibiting the use of many chemicals. Even though prohibited, toxic inorganics could\naccumulate in the food chain from the processing of\nnonterrestrial materials that contain trace metals. The\nseverity of this problem increases as the ecological\nsystem approaches closure.\nThe current Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nlist of possibly dangerous compounds includes some\n30,000 substances. To analyze the effects, transport, and\nfates of toxic materials in the Earth environment, considerable resources are being committed by EPA, the\nNational Institute of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Cancer Institute, and various\nindustries. A comparable effort is required for the space\nhabitat. Every product, either transported from Earth or\nsynthesized in space, must be evaluated in terms of\nmanufacture, use, and disposal or recycling.\nEnvironmental Monitoring\nBiological systems are difficult to monitor. Sensitive\ndetectors for the rapid measurement of pH, temperature,\nand a variety of compounds such as H2 S, S02 , and CO 2 ,\nand sensors for toxic organic compounds, heavy metals,\nand microorganisms have been developed for on-line\ncontrol. However, much labor-intensive analysis is\ninvolved using routine microbiological techniques and\nmodern analytical chemistry techniques, such as combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, electron\n\n25\n\nmicroprobe, or atomic absorption spectrometry. Because\nbiological transformations occur very rapidly, computercompatible monitoring systems must be developed for\nreal-time analysis of trace quantities of organic, inorganic, and biolOgical components. These computer systems should include anticipatory problem-predictive\ncapabilities so that control measures can be implemented\nwhile there is still time to avert calamity.\nThe computerized monitoring systems may be augmented with sensitive biological indicator species; the\ncoal miner\'s canary is the classical example. It may be\npossible to develop genetic strains that are sensitive to\nspecific toxic conditions. These biological sensors might\nprovide more efficient early warning against specific or\nsynergistic toxic effects than could either electrical or\nmechanical monitoring systems.\nConsiderable interest exists in developing indices of\npathologies for ecosystems comparable to those used by\nphysicians. For example, infrared scanners might be used\nto determine changes in respiration patterns in controlled agricultural systems or shifts in the ratio of\nchiorophyl/carotenoid pigments could be monitored to\nindicate changes in algal populations.\nSome environmental characteristics might be clustered to the extent that only one component may be\nmeasured. The other components may then be predicted\nwith reasonable confidence. By perturbing synthetic ecosystems with known toxins, these diagnostic methods\ncan be evaluated.\nFire Hazard\nIn a large space habitat with a terrestrial atmosphere,\nmany of the conventional techniques of fire protection\ncan be used. However, a priority must be placed on fire\nprevention because even a limited fire could have a\ndevastating effect. An uncontrolled or smoldering fire\nwould pose a serious threat to the structural integrity of\nthe habitat because of the extensive heat and pressures\nproduced. The constraints of habitat design have two\nimportant consequences in fire situations: egress will be\nlimited and few items on board will be expendable.\nAtmospheric contamination will occur from toxic,\ncorrosive, and flammable residuals of combustion and\npyrolysis. Therefore, fire safety will depend on careful\nmaterial selection. Attention must be given to fire resistance, toxicity, and smoke evolution properties of all\nproposed materials. Fire detection and rapid automatic\ncontrol will be the key issues. Combustion products\nfrom sustained burning could overwhelm even the most\nconservatively designed life-support system. This prob-\n\n26\n\nlem normally does not occur on Earth because the\natmosphere provides a means of rapid dispersal. In addition, many conventional flame-retardant materials and\nextinguishing agents are themselves toxic (e.g., halogenated organics) and would pose an added threat to the\nlife-support system.\nRadiation Hazard\nThe wide spectrum of radiation in the space environment will pose a serious health hazard to man and to the\nbiological components of the space ecosystem (as discussed in the companion paper prepared by the LSSB).\nThe shielding requirements for all candidate biological\nsubsystems should be investigated further. Design shortcomings must not compromise the safety and well-being\nof humans functioning in space.\nNoise Hazard\nCurrent EPA noise standards for community and\nindustrial areas are 70 and 90 dB, respectively. In the\nenclosed structure of a space habitat, the propagation of\nsound and vibration throughout the hull will pose a\nunique problem. In addition, the echo effect could be\nsevere. Skylab astronauts experienced both these difficulties and also complained that differential heating of\nthe spacecraft was a major source of noise (ref. 39).\nClearly, a comprehensive design strategy must be\ndeveloped to limit noise pollution aboard a space habitat. This capability is represented by state-of-the-art submarine technology: the use of acoustic material to\ncombat echos, and specially designed equipment mounts\nand foundation structures to isolate sources of vibration\n(refs. 40, 41). Mechanical oscillation can be dissipated as\nheat if the foundation structure is properly damped and\nits resonant modes avoided. In a space habitat, an alternative means to combat the problem of noise would be\nto physically separate industrial and community living\nareas.\nGravitational and Rotational Problems\nThe only practical means for providing pseudo gravity\nto a space habitat is to rotate the habitat structure.\nGreater economy is reached at higher rotation rates\n(ref. 42); however, it has been shown that living in a\nrapidly rotating system can cause severe physiological\ndisturbances due to Coriolis force (refs. 43, 44). Upon\nhead rotation, out of the plane of vehicle rotation,\nsemicircular canal fluids will undergo cross-coupled\n\naccelerations. This can result in motion sickness and\ndisorientation (ref. 43). Vestibular physiologists have\ndetermined that most people can adapt to rotational\nrates up to 4 rpm (ref. 43). Although adverse symptoms\nusually disappear after a few days, some individuals are\nless tolerant. To avoid rotation-rate sensitivity as a constraint in crew selection, a maximum of 1 rpm has been\nadopted as an engineering guideline for large habitats\n(~I06 inhabitants) (1. Billingham, NASA Ames\nResearch Center, personal communication, July 1977).\nThe syndrome of space motion sickness, on exposure\nto zero gravity, is well known from Apollo and Sky lab\nexperience. Susceptible astronauts have required 2 to\n5 days to adjust to zero gravity, during which they\nsuffered from effects similar to motion sickness. This\nillness has been thought to result from conflicts that\narise between perceptions of the visual and vestibular\nsystems. It is not yet known what the effect will be of\nmoving between the rotating and zero-gravity habitat\nregions (ref. 43). Functioning in the two environments\nwill require two modes of vestibular operation. Conceivably, workers involved in extravehicular or zero-gravity\nactivities may have to reside in zero gravity for additional periods to minimize vestibular symptoms.\n\nResearch and Development Options\nEarly emphasis should be placed on the investigations\nlisted below.\n1. Develop a data base for those microbiological\nfunctions that will produce usable end products or generate residuals in quantities large enough to affect\nambient environmental conditions.\n2. Develop a predictive model for the rate of genetic\nchange expected in candidate microbial populations, specifically as they relate to space-habitat conditions. Correlate results with experiments in controlled environments,\ninvolving single and multispecies microcosms.\n3. Review disease control techniques and develop a\nrationale for their application to the space habitat;\ndevelop an interface between disease control specialists\nand habitat design engineers.\n4. Develop a comprehensive data base on Earth-based\ntechnology that .is applicable to space habitats in the\nfollowing areas:\na. Disease control in plants and animals\nb. Aerosol biology and atmospheric contamination control\nc. Aquatic microbiology and water pollution control\n\nd. Food preservation technology\ne. Microbial toxic by-products and microbial\ntransformations of industrial materials\nf. Quarantine and containment methodology\ng. Sterilization and decontamination technology\nincluding both physical and chemical\ntechniques.\n5. Develop, with the aid of the EPA, a list of all toxic\ncompounds and products that contain these toxic compounds; design strategies for controlling toxic compounds released from products.\n6. Develop an on-line, real-time system to monitor\ncritical inorganic, organic, and biological activities;\ndevelop anticipatory problem-predictive computer\nmodels that have adequate response times; test a prototype computer control system in environmental chambers; test advanced systems on the Shuttle.\n7. For long-term space settlements, investigate the\nuse of specimen banks of key organisms, tissues, and\nmaterials so that an adequate environmental baseline\n"library" can be available to facilitate effective control\nmeasures.\n8. Develop genetic strains of micro- and macroplant\nand animal species for use as sensitive environmental\nindicators; test these indicator species in environmental\nchambers that simulate proposed habitat conditions.\n9. Develop monitors and test procedures for environmental pathologies; test these procedures in synthetic\nenvironments that simulate proposed habitat\necosystems.\n10. Develop fire-retardant and extinguishing agents\nto reduce toxicity of combustion and pyrolysis\nproducts; determine which toxic combustion residuals\nare more compatible with candidate life-support\nsystems.\n11. Investigate radiation shielding requirements for\nman, plant, and microbe populations during long-term\nspaceflight experiments.\n12. Investigate human sensitivity to rotating environments, as well as the effects of alternating between\nrotating and zero-gravity systems.\n13. Determine the optimum environmental conditions for plant, animal, microbial, and human components of the habitat; explore the extent to which modularization, for isolation and retreat from catastrophic\nevents (or separate environmental control of sectors),\nwill be more advantageous than an undivided system;\nperform economic and reliability analyses with respect\nto advantages of redundancy over maintaining a single\nintegral system.\n\n27\n\nCRITERIA FOR ESTABLISHING RESEARCH\nPRIORITIES\nA principal conclusion of this study is that it is\npremature to prescribe priorities for resource allocation\namong the research options presented here. However, a\nprocedure was developed to assign priorities in a carefully planned manner. The major elements of this recommended procedure are summarized below.\n1. Scenarios for closed life-support systems, comprised of various promising combinations of biological\nand physicochemical species, should be formulated,\nquantified, evaluated, and compared according to the\nmethodology discussed in the preceding companion\npaper.\n2. The scenarios should consider terrestrial as well as\nnonterrestrial atmospheric and gravitational conditions,\nconventional as well as unconventional diet bases, etc.\nSensitivity analyses should be performed for each scenario to characterize its stability features, poten tial\nproblem areas, and performance limitations in optimum\nas well as nonoptimum modes of operation. The resulting characterizations can then be used to define pacing\nresearch needs.\n3. Potential research and development costs and time\nrequirements should be estimated for each scenario.\nWhere these estimates are very sensitive to the accuracy\nof technical estimates that are not reliable at present,\nresearch requirements to refine these latter estimates\nshould be indicated.\n4. Research priorities should be assigned to studies\nthat show the highest cost-effectiveness potential and\nthe most universally valuable potential results.\n5. A national colloquium of experts in all key technology areas related to closed life-support systems\nshould be conducted as soon as possible to refine the list\nof research options. This will permit planning based on\nlarger representation of relevant expertise than was available during this study.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Spurlock, J.

The purpose of this paper is to quantify the habitat weight and cost penalties associated with this conservative\ndesign approach. These penalties are identified by comparison of conservative Earth-normal designs with habitats\ndesigned to less than Earth-normal conditions. Physiological research areas are also recommended as a necessary prerequisite to realizing these potential weight and cost savings. Major habitat structural elements, that is, pressure shell\nand radiation shielding, for populations of 10 2 , 104 , and 10 6 , are evaluated for effects of atmospheric pressure, pseudogravity level, radiation shielding thickness, and habitat configuration. Results show that broader habitable g-ranges,\nreduced atmospheric pressure, and detached radiation shielding all have a significant effect in reducing habitat costs.\nAlso, a minimum cost per person is discovered for a habitat with a population of about 10 5 , and this cost is independent of habitat configuration.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe design of space habitats is highly dependent on\nboth the physiological conditions needed to support life\nand the psychological conditions conducive to enjoyable\nliving. The physiological requirements for a breathable\natmosphere, cosmic radiation protection, and pseudogravity have a direct effect on the structural weight and\ncost of the habitat. Psychological conditions also have an\nimportant, although less readily assessable, influence on\nweight and cost through variations in habitat configurations and interior design. This paper addresses only the\nphysiological effects on habitat structural designs. The\nresults obtained, however, should support subsequent\nlivability analyses by supplying sensitivities for evaluating alternative habitat configurations and interior\ndesigns.\nThe minimum environmental requirements for shortduration life support in space are fairly well understood.\nLess well known are long-term effects under less than\nEarth-normal conditions. Conceptual space-settlement\nhabitat designs proposed to date have eliminated this\nconcern by use of the conservative design philosophy of\nEarth-normal conditions. The questions which this paper\n\naddresses are: (1) How much does this design conservatism cost from a structural standpoint? (2) Which areas\nof physiological research into less than Earth-normal\nconditions offer the greatest potential decrease in habitat construction and operating costs? (3) Do the combined results of sensitivity studies performed during this\ninvestigation lead to a recommended habitat configuration that offers the best potential for satisfying physiological requirements at minimum cost?\nTo address these questions, the following approach\nhas been taken: First, the established range of human\ntolerance limits has been defined for those physiological\nconditions which directly affect habitat structural\ndesign. Second, these entire ranges, or portions thereof,\nwere set as habitat design constraints as a function of\nhabitat population and degree of ecological closure.\nThird, calculations were performed to determine the\nstructural weight and cost associated with each discrete\npopulation size and its selected environmental conditions. These calculations were performed on the basis of\nhabitable volume equivalence for four basic habitat configurations: sphere, cylinder with hemispherical ends,\ntorus, and crystal palace.\n\n33\n\nSufficient point designs were analyzed to permit\ngraphical comparison of habitat structural weights and\ncosts due to a broad range of environmental and population conditions. Those environmental parameters that\nthen offered the greatest economic benefits when\nreduced to less than Earth-normal conditions (but within\nestablished human tolerance limits) were readily\nidentified.\nIt should be emphasized that the work contained in\nthis paper is not an analysis of a total habitat system;\nrather, it is limited to environmental and configuration\nsensitivity analyses of the habitat pressure shell and\nradiation shielding, plus considerations of habitat illumination and atmospheric composition. Except for their\ngross influence on the basic habitat structural design,\nsuch habitat subsystems as the following have not been\nevaluated or costed as part of this work: internal secondary structures (buildings); furnishings and personal\neffects; life-support equipment such as air conditioning,\nwater supply, sewage treatment, etc.; photovoltaic\npower arrays and waste heat radiators; and spin alignment bearings, hub airlock, and docking facilities.\nDuring performance of work at the 1977 Ames\nSummer Study relating to this paper, two study team\nleaders made significant contributions: Dr. Gerard\nO\'Neill suggested the structural analysis approach used\nfor comparing alternative habitat configurations, and\nprovided an example derivation upon which the generation of structural formulas was based. Dr. John\nBillingham provided guidance on physiological conditions and was an excellent source for reference materials.\nBoth Doctors O\'Neill and Billingham contributed to the\nselection of representative physiological design constraints for the three habitat populations investigated.\n\nPersonal Space and Furnishings\nHabitats must be designed to provide comfortable\nliving, service, social, and recreational facilities. These\nneeds can be analyzed in terms of area, volume, and\ninternal mass requirements per person, as a function of\npopulation size, duration of stay, habitat remoteness,\netc. Three population sizes (10 2 , 104 , and 10 6 ) were\nselected for evaluation to encompass a broad range of\nhabitat volumes. These populations span communities\nranging from early space construction facilities to large,\nrelatively self-sufficient settlements.\nVolume and area requirements for "military-type"\nspacecraft and submersible vehicles have been established for relatively short durations (less than\n12 months) (ref. 2). Use of these data for space settlements would be inappropriate, because these data apply\nto temporary assignments in which personnel return\nhome when the tour of duty is completed. Although this\nsame reasoning also applies to short-duration civilian\nhabitats, a significant increase in volumetric allocation\nper person should be allowed. No real data are available\nfor modern, long-duration (>1 year), remote civilian\nhabitats, but information from the 1975 Ames Summer\nStudy on Space Settlements (ref. 3) was used in conjunction with the existing short-duration data to provide the\ncivilian volumetric requirement curves shown in figure 1.\n\n1000\n\nPHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITIONS\n\n:--l~\n\n34\n\n4 TEKTITE I\n0 0\n_ _ - MILITARY- TYPE HABITATS\n\n.\n\nE~\n\nHuman tolerance limits have been defined for physiological conditions that directly influence habitat structural design requirements. Those environmental parameters which directly affect the habitat structure include\ninternal personal space and furnishings, atmospheric\npressure, and gravitational acceleration. Other environmental features that can influence structural mass due to\nimplementation options are radiation protection and\nillumination techniques. Additional features such as\nnoise abatement or vibration control, which do not\ndirectly influence structural mass, have not been\nincludee in this analysis.

The data point for\na 10 2 population habitat was derived from the same\nsource; table 1 summarizes the details pertaining to both\nconfigurations.\nThe location of these points on the duration abscissa\nin figure 1 was based on space manufacturing population\nbuildup projections (refs. 4, 5). Early habitats with small\npopulations will probably exchange personnel annually\nor biennially. Larger (10 4 ) intermediate habitats are\nexpected to receive Earth-trained personnel who will\nspend their productive years in space, but will return to\nEarth for retirement. Populations one or two orders of\nmagnitude greater will probably spend their entire lives\n(vacations excepted) in the habitats. The transition point\nfrom an Earth-resupplied habitat to one that is mostly\nself-sufficient is expected to occur in the 10 4 to lOS\npopulation range, with substantial on-site foodproduction experiments performed somewhat earlier.\nThe largest volume/person requirements curve in figure 1\nreflects the additional volume needed for food\nproduction.\n\nAs mentioned previously, both volume and area\nrequirements are important measures of habitat livability. When comparing alternative habitat configurations,\nhowever, only one of these measures of personal space\ncan be used as the independent variable. Most previous\nefforts to define habitat configurations have imposed\nvery strict limits on g-level variations (0.9 to 1.0 g), and\nhave used area as the independent variable. For this\ncomparison, wide g ranges will be studied (including\nzero g) which makes area a very poor criterion for comparison (essentially meaningless for zero g). All habitat\npopUlation sizes and geometries have therefore been\nconfigured and analyzed on a volume equivalence basis,\nthat is, a fixed volume per person for each habitat\npopulation, independent of habitat geometry.\nInternal habitat mass per person is a measure of\nhousing and furnishing, and of personal effects allocation. Unfortunately, little appropriate Earth data exist\nto aid in evaluating this parameter because (1) the cost\nof Earth-based housing materials, which comprise the\nlargest percentage of personal habitat mass, is generally\ninversely proportional to their mass, that is, concrete\nand construction lumber, and (2) a large percentage of\n\nTABLE 1.- COMMUNITY AREA AND VOLUME ALLOCA nONS\n100-person habitat\n\n1O,000-person habitat\n\nSurface area\nrequired,\nm 2 /person\n\nEstimated\nheight,\nm\n\nVolume,\nm3\n\nSurface area\nrequired,\nm 2 /person\n\nEstimated\nheight,\nm\n\nResidential\nBusiness\nPublic space\nService industry\nStorage\nTransportation\nMech. subsystem\nMiscellaneous\n\n49\n2.3\n8.4\n2.5\n5\n3.1\n5.5\n3.2\n\n2.5\n2.5\n6\n2.5\n2.5\n2.5\n4\n4\n\n122.5\n5.8\n50.4\n6.3\n12.5\n7.7\n22\n12.8\n\n49\n3.4\n14.2\n4\n5\n12\n5.0\n3.5\n\n3\n4\n36.5\n6\n3.2\n6\n4\n4\n\nSubtotals\n\n79.1\n\n240\n\n96.1\n\nSpace use\n\nAgriculture\nPlant growing\nAnimal area\nFood processing\nAgriculture drying\nTotals\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n79.1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n240\n\n44\n5\n4\n8\n157.1\n\nVolume\nm3\n147\n13.6\n518.3\n24\n16\n72\n\n20\n14\n824.9\n\n15\n15\n15\n15\n\n660\n75\n60\n120\n1739.9\n\n35\n\n-\n\n-\n\nhabitat internal mass will be manufactured from "leftover" lunar material, resulting in designs and material\nuses significantly different from their Earth functional\ncounterparts. The best estimate of habitat internal mass\navailable in current literature is found in the 1975 Ames\nSummer Study (ref. 3). Since the internal mass requirements should be relatively independent of total population size or volumetric allocation, fixed values for\nlimited recycling (43,000 kg/person) and maximum\nrecycling (53,000 kg/person) habitats were selected.\nPseudo gravity and Rotation Rate\nThe physiological effect of long-term weightlessness is\nnot fully understood. The Skylab 4 astronauts, who\nwere weightless for 84 days, experienced progressive\nbone decalcification. It is unclear whether these losses\nstabilize for longer exposures. If they do not, then some\nlevel of artificial gravity will be required to prevent\nsevere osteoporosis (ref. I).\nThe only way to establish pseudo gravity in a space\nhabitat is by rotation. This rotation, however, can cause\ndisorientation and motion sickness due to influence of\nthe Corio lis effect on the vestibular system if the rate of\nrotation is too high. Because studies in rotating rooms\non Earth have shown that most personnel adapt to\nrotation rates of 3 rpm (ref. I), this rate will be chosen\nas the guideline for small, selective, IOO-person habitats.\nFor the adaptability and comfort of a general population\nhabitat (10 6 ), it is generally accepted that rates above\nI rpm should be avoided. Since the 104 habitat will not\nbe as selective as the earlier habitat but more selective\nthan the 10 6 habitat, it is reasonable to consider 2 rpm\nas its rotation rate.\n\nalso been proposed (ref. 3), but are currently speculative\nand require further substantiation. Figure 2 shows the\ngalactic dose rate as a function of passive shielding\nthickness. Since nuclear interactions are the primary\nattenuation mechanism, secondary emission products are\na major concern. These secondary products consist of\nfour main types: cascade protons, cascade neutrons,\nevaporation protons, and evaporation neutrons. Of these\nfour, only the cascade products are significant since the\neffects of evaporation products are approximately two\norders of magnitude smaller than those of the primary\nprotons (ref. 6).\nCurrent U.S. standards for whole-body radiation are\n5 rem/yr for radiation workers and 0.5 rem/yr for the\ngeneral popUlation. Since the inhabitants of the early\nhabitats (100 and 10,000 people) will be selected adult\ngroups with short to intermediate stay times (1 to\n30 yr), we can consider them to be radiation workers\nand design the shielding for 5 rem/yr. To achieve this\nprotection from galactic radiation, 280-g/cm 2 shielding\nis required.\n\n100\n\n/LOWZTOTAL\n\nRadiation and Shielding\nRadiation poses a major problem in space-settlement\ndevelopment because of the constant presence of galactic (cosmic) rays. This type of low-level radiation is\nisotropic and consists of about 87 percent protons\n(low Z) and 13 percent heavier nuclei (high Z). "Z" is\nthe charge on the particle, which determines its ionizing\npower or the quantity of chemical bonds broken by its\npassage through human tissue. The other source of space\nradiation, solar flares, is normally at an insignificantly\nlow level, but can occasionally rise to extremely high\nlevels for periods of a few hours or a few days\n(refs. 6-8).\nThe best protection against radiation is the use of\npassive shields. Active "plasma radiation shields" have\n\n36\n\no\n\nFigure 2.- Galactic dose rates with passive shielding.\n\nThe problem of solar flares, however, must still be\naddressed. Figure 3 shows the total radiation dose as a\nfunction of shield thickness for the proton component\nof an anomalously large flare approximating the intensity of the August 1972 flare. The secondary products\nare included in this calculation, but the dose from alpha\nparticles is ignored. The alpha flux, however, is less than\n20 percent of the primary rem dose (ref. 9). Thus,\n280-g/cm 2 shielding would attenuate the radiation well\nbelow the current U.S. standard for a single emergency\nexposure of 25 rem. However, on 23 February 1956, the\nlargest flare on record took place. It has been estimated\nthat during this flare people shielded by approximately\n500 g/cm 2 would have received 25 rem (ref. 10). Fortunately, a flare of this magnitude occurs only once in\n20 years. Thus, since people will only live in the\n100-person habitat for about 1 year, there would be\nlittle need for any additional protection. However,\nbecause of the longer duration of the 1O,000-person\nhabitat, a flare shelter with an additional 220 g/cm 2 of\nshielding will be necessary.\nThe 10 6 -person habitat has an unselected general\npopulation. Thus the radiation level must not exceed\n0.5 rem/yr. To achieve this, shielding of 550 g/ cm 2 is\nrequired. Not only does this protect against galactic\n\nradiation, but it also attenuates the radiation of the\nlargest solar flare to below the maximum permissible for\na single emergency exposure. A shelter still might be\ndesirable, however, to protect young children and pregnant women.\nAtmosphere\n\nIn considering the structural design of a habitat, the\ntotal atmospheric pressure is important since it is one of\nthe most significant loads. The lowest pressure will result\nwhen the atmosphere contains pure oxygen at a partial\npressure similar to that in Earth\'s atmosphere. Figure 4\nshows the pure oxygen atmospheric pressure required\nfor human lungs to physiologically achieve an equivalent\nEarth altitude. To obtain an Earth sea-level equivalent,\n25.3 kPa of pure oxygen is required. This can probably\nbe reduced to 20.0 kPa for the early 100 person habitat\nsince the personnel will be highly selected and could\nreasonably be expected to function normally in an atmosphere equivalent to 2400 m (8000 ft) above sea level.\nThe inhabitants of the intermediate 1O,000-person habitat would also be selected, but to less stringent criteria,\nso they could operate at an equivalent l200-m (4000-ft)\nlevel or 22.5 kPa pure oxygen.\nThe desire to operate at such low pressures might be\ntempered, however, by the fact that sound does not\ntravel well at low pressure (Refs. 11,12). For instance,\nthe Skylab astronauts, who lived in a total pressure of\n34.4 kPa (0.33 atm) said that the limit of a loud speaking voice was about 5 m. This often left them hoarse\n(ref. 11). Another possible problem with low pressures is\ndiminished effectiveness of the cough mechanism\n(refs. 12, 13).\n\n~\nw\n\n26\n\no\n\'"\nC\n-J\n\n\xc2\xab\n...\no\n...\n\n10\nSHIELDING REQUIREMENTS. 9/cm 2\n\nFigure 3.- Solar flare dose rates with passive shielding.\n\nFigure 4.- Pure oxygen atmospheric pressure at\nequivalent Earth altitude.\n\n37\n\nFor these reasons, and to reduce fire danger, it is\ndesirable to increase the total pressure by adding a\nrelatively inert gas. Considerable experience has been\nobtained with nitrogen, Earth\'s atmosphere diluent, and\nhelium. Although nitrogen is our natural atmospheric\ndiluent, it has one disadvantage: under fast decompression, nitrogen bubbles are released, causing the bends.\nThe best alternative inert gas, helium, reduces man\'s\nsusceptibility to the bends. Helium also inhibits atelectasis, the tendency for lung collapse, better than nitrogen, but since both helium and nitrogen are superior to\npure oxygen, this difference becomes insignificant\n(refs. 13, 14). Because helium is much less dense than\nnitrogen its use could lead to significant reductions in\ntransportation cost. Its major disadvantage is severe\nvoice distortion.\nThe most important function of a diluent gas is to\nreduce fire danger. Fire hazards in O2 -rich environments\nhave been studied extensively. It has been demonstrated\nthat the burning rate of filter paper in 0.2 atm of pure\noxygen is approximately twice that in 1.0 atm of 21 percent O 2 + 79 percent N2 (ref. 15). Furthermore, many\nconventional flame-proofed materials burn readily in\n30 percent to 40 percent O 2 (ref. 16). Helium diluent is\nnot as effective in reducing the burning rate as is nitrogen (refs. 14, 16). The major factor in overall fire safety,\nhowever, is not to control the burning rate but to\nprevent ignition (ref. 17). As the percentage of O 2 in the\natmosphere increases, the minimum pressure required\nfor ignition decreases dramatically.\nFigure 5 shows the components of oxygen-nitrogen\nmixtures that are physiologically equivalent to sea-level\nair as a function of total pressure.

The trade-off between\ndecreased total pressure and increased fire danger must\nbe fully considered before final selection of a space\nhabitat atmosphere is made.\n\nIII umina ti on\nThe most important component of man\'s sensory\napparatus is his visual system. This makes it particularly\nimportant for space-settlement inhabitants to have\nproper lighting in their work, rest, and living areas. One\nof the largest habitability problems aboard Skylab was\nthe lack of proper illumination. In fact, the lighting was\nso poor the astronauts were unable to read a book\n(ref. 11).\nThe amount of lighting required depends on the specific task being performed. Table 2 presents illumination\nrequirements for the 10,000-person habitat. As shown,\nthe maximum power required is 929.7 W/person for\nliving and work areas and 11,210 W/person for agricultural areas. These numbers were calculated assuming that\nthe lights are on constantly. A more useful number can\nbe obtained by calculating the percentage of time a\nparticular area will be used, that is, when lights are on.\nConservative estimates for these requirements are:\n556.7 W/person for living and work areas and\n5692 W/person for agricultural areas - a total illumination requirement of 6248 W/person.\nThese values are conservatively high. The values were\nconverted from lumens to watts by assuming a luminous\nefficacy of 50 lumen/W. Furthermore, the light reflected\nfrom walls, ceilings, and furnishings, which can have a\nsignificant effect on illumination intensity, was ignored.\nThese surfaces become secondary sources of illumination, thus lowering the primary light-source intensity\nrequirement (refs. 18, 19).\nStudies have shown that the best light for reducing\neye fatigue in industrial work is diffused or reflected.\nReflected light depends on the properties of the work\narea surface. Reflection from a matte surface is diffuse\nwhile that from a polished surface is speCUlar. Mirrorlike\nsurfaces tend to glare, which greatly increases eye\nfatigue. Furthermore, the overall color climate of the\nhabitat can have great physiological and psychological\neffect (ref. 19). Thus, the detailed design of a space\nhabitat must consider these factors.\n\nTABLE 2.- ILLUMINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR 1O,000-PERSON HABITAT\n\nSpace\nuse\n\nPercentage\nof time\nspace\nis used\n\nResidential\n\n50\n\nBusiness\nShops\nOffice\n\n50\n50\n\nPublic\nSchools\nHospitals\nAssembly\nRecreation\n\n50\n100\n50\n100\n\nPublic open space\n\n100\n\nService industry\nStorage\n\nRequired\nspace,a\nm 2 /person\n\nLighting\nrequired,\nfe/task\n\nTotal\nwattage,\nW/person\n\nLighting\nrequired,\nW/m 2\n\nmaximum\n49\n\nweighted\n\n50\n\n11\n\n2.4\n1\n\n100\n100\n\n22\n22\n\n52.8\n22.0\n\n26.4\n11\n\n1\n0.3\n\n100\n150\n40\n75\n\n22\n33\n9\n16.5\n\n22\n10\n13.5\n16.5\n\n11\n10\n6.8\n16.5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n4.4\n\n44\n\n44\n\n50\n\n4\n\n60\n\n13.2\n\n52.8\n\n2.6.4\n\n50\n\n5\n\n40\n\n8.8\n\n44\n\n22.0\n\nTransportation\n\n100\n\n12\n\n15\n\n3.3\n\n39.6\n\n39.6\n\nMechanical\nsubsystems\nSwitching\nWater treatment\nElectrical supply\n\n100\n100\n100\n\n0.3\n4.5\n0.2\n\n60\n30\n30\n\n13.2\n6.6\n6.6\n\n4.0\n29.7\n1.3\n\n4.0\n29.7\n1.3\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n100\n\n3.5\n\n50\n\n11\n\n38.5\n\n38.5\n\n929.7\n\n556.7\n\nSubtotals\nAgriculture\nPlant growing\nAnimal\nFood processing\nPlant drying\nSubtotals\nTotals\n\n1.5\n\n1.4\n\n96.1\n\n50\n80\n80\n100\n\n44\n5\n4\n8\n61\n157.1\n\n--\n\n--_.---\n\n250\n10\n10\nIS\n\n539\n\n269.5\n\n11,000\n50\n40\n120\n\n5500\n40\n32\n120\n\n11,210\n\n5692\n\n12,139.7\n\n6248.7\n\naData obtained from table 1.\n\n39\n\nDESIGN CONSTRAINTS SUMMARY\nThe tolerable environmental range for satisfying basic\nhuman physiological needs has now been established.\nThis range was constrained on the basis of total habitat\npopulation. Early construction facilities with small\npopulations will be inhabited by carefully selected crew\nmembers and their mission durations limited by reasonable exchange periods. As the population and size of\nhabitats increase, environmental conditions should be\nchanged toward Earth normal, so increased livability and\ncomfort permit extended stay times. This trend is important since personnel selection criteria will be progressively relaxed, and transportation costs for frequent\nlarge population exchanges will be excessive.\nTable 3 sununarizes the physiological design constraints selected for the three habi tat populations investigated. These populations represent the full growth range\nfrom early construction shacks for space manufacturing\nto large "ecologically closed" settlements for unselected\nspace immigrants.\nTABLE 3.- PARAMETRIC DESIGN\nCONDITIONS\nStay time, yr\nParameters\nlor2\nHabitat population\nMaximum\nrotation, rpm\nRadiation, rem/yr\nAtmospheric\npressure, kPa\nMaximum\nIntermediate\nMinimum\nVolume/person, m3\nLimited\nrecycling\nMaximum\nrecycling\n(agriculture)\nInternal mass/\nperson, kg\nLimited\nrecycling\nMaximum\nrecycling\n\n40\n\n30\n\n80\n\n10 2\n\n10 4\n\n10 6\n\n3\n5\n\n2\n5\n\n101.3\n51.7\n20.0\n\n101.3\n51.7\n22.5\n\n240\n\n825\n\n---\n\n---\n\n1740\n\n2000\n\n43,000\n\n43,000\n53,000\n\n1\n0.5\n\n101.3\n51.7\n25.3\n\n53,000\n\nRotation rates for providing pseudo gravity decrease\nfrom a maximum 3 rpm for a small carefully selected\ncrew to a rotation rate :;;;;1 rpm for a more general\npopulation. Similarly, radiation worker dosages of\n5 rem/yr are constraints for the 10 2 and 104 habitats,\nwhile general population dosage limits of 0.5 rem/yr are\nused for the largest habitat.\nA range of three atmospheric pressures has been\nselected for comparative purposes. Full and approximately half sea-level pressures are the maximum and\nintermediate selections for all three populations. The\nminimum pressure is a 100-percent oxygen physiological\nequivalent to the partial pressure of oxygen at 2400 m\n(8000 ft), 1200 m (4000 ft), and sea level on Earth for\npopulations of 10 2 , 104 , and 10 6 , respectively.\nAll habitats are limited to a maximum g level of 1.0;\nminimum g levels ranging from 0 to 0.7 are used as\ndesign constraints. These minimum g levels, combined\nwith volumetric requirements, serve to define the habitat\ngeometry for each of the four configurations investigated. The appearance of these volumetrically equivalent\ngeometries varies as a function of how close the spherical\nconfiguration approaches the gmax limit at the maximum allowable rotation rate, as shown in figure 6. The\nexample on the left depicts a sphere where the radius\nrequired to obtain the specified habitable volume is not\nclose to the gmax limit. For this case an equivalent\ncylinder does not exist, the equivalent torus has a circular cross section, and the crystal palace has multiple\nlayers. Habitable volume for the torus and crystal palace\nconfiguration is equal to their respective total volumes.\nThe example on the right in figure 6 shows a sphere\nfor which the radius required to meet volumetric\nrequirements would result in g levels exceeding gmax if\nthe sphere were to rotate at the maximum allowable\nrate. To satisfy all design constraints, the radius is\nincreased and the rotation rate decreased until the habitable volume just fits within the gmax/gmin limits. For\nthis case, an equivalent cylinder rotating at the maximum rate does exist, as well as a toroidal design with\ncylindrical walls. The equivalent crystal palace has fewer\nlayers (only one layer is depicted) to remain within the g\nlimits.\nThe appearance of an "equivalent" torus with cylindrical inner and outer walls imposes one additional\ndesigri constraint. To prevent the inside cylindrical wall\nfrom buckling because of atmospheric-pressure-imposed\ncompressive stresses, the "gravity load" on this surface\ncan be made equal to or greater than the pressure load.\nThis can be accomplished by suspending the entire\ninternal mass from the interior wall and/or adding\n\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSES\n9max\n\nSPHERE\n\nI\nRPM\n\nI\n\n= RPM max\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nRADIUS\n\nI\n=\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n8949\n(RPMI 2\n\nCYLINDER\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nBoth mass and cost sensitivity analyses were conducted for selected habitat elements. The structural mass\nsensitivities are presented first, followed by cost sensitivities for structural configurations (pressure shell and\nradiation shielding), atmospheric composition, and\nillumination implementation. All cost estimates were\nbased on common ground rules which assumed use of\nlunar materials, unless the required elements were\nunavailable in lunar feedstock, in which case these materials were obtained from Earth. Asteroidal resources\nwere not considered. Mass estimates were obtained by\nperforming structural analyses of habitat pressure shell\nand radiation shielding configurations as a function of\npopulation, atmospheric pressure, minimum g level, and\nshielding integration techniques.\n\nTORUS\n\nStructural Analyses\n\nCRYSTAL\nPALACE\n\nFigure 6.- Volume equivalence configuration\ncomparison.\n\nattached radiation shielding. An alternative approach\nprovides compressive load-carrying capability by structurally stiffening the interior wall.\nRadiation shielding is required on all habitats to protect the population from cosmic rays and solar flares. A\nchoice exists, however, as to how this shielding is integrated with the structural shell. Direct attachment is\nundesirable because centrifugal loading added by the\nrotating shielding has a major influence on the structural\nshell thickness (and mass) requirements. The alternative\nis to mount the shielding outside the structural shell so\nthat it either remains stationary, or counterrotates at a\nreduced angular velocity to obtain a net zero angular\nmomentum for the entire habitat. This requires that\nalignment/positioning devices (i.e., mechanical bearings)\nbe used to maintain a positive separation distance\nbetween the shell and shielding. To permit structural\ncomparison of these two alternatives, both attached and\ndetached shielding options were investigated.\n\nAs the initial step of the habitat structural design\ntrade, geometries were determined for the sphere, cylinder with hemispherical ends (when applicable), torus,\nand crystal palace on an equivalent habitable volume\nbasis. The geometric relationships used are summarized\nin figure 7. Dimensions and important geometric parameters for the 65 shapes included in this analysis are listed\nin table 4. These characteristics were obtained by applying the design constraints identified in table 3.\nEach of these habitat shapes was investigated for\nstructural effects caused by the full range of established\ndesign constraints. Membrane stress-analysis techniques\nwere used for the spherical, cylindrical, and toroidal\nmonolithic geometries. For the modular crystal palace,\nelement techniques based on O\'Neill\'s work were used\n(ref. 20). The membrane analysis was accomplished by\nresolving all shell loads (atmospheric pressure, skin inertial, internal furnishings inertial, and attached shielding\ninertial) into combined normal and tangential distributed loads. This enabled the required structural material\nthickness to be determined by the relationships:\n\now =\n\nPnormalR\n\n2ts\n\n+\n\nq tangential\n\n(sphere)\n\nts\n\nPnormalR\n\n\xc2\xb0w=\n\naw =\n\n(cylinder)\n\nts\nPnormalr\n\nts\n\n2R-r sin 8\n2(R-r sin 8)\n\n+ qtangential\n\n(torus)\n\nts\n\n41\n\nSPHERE\n\nAXIS OF\nROTATION\n\n-6---1--\n\ny\n\n=\n\ntJ.g\n9\n\nAp = 4"R 2 (1-\n\ny)~\n\nFOR\n\nY ~O.293\n\nAp = 2" R2\n\nCYLINDER\n\nAp = 2"R(1 -y) (L + 2Rv2-;--=-?)\n\ny = tJ.g\n9\n\nTORUS\n\nAS = 4,,2 R, + 4" LR\n\nAOUTER\n= 2,,2 R, + 4",2 + 2" L (R + "\nSURFACE\n\nAINNER\nSURFACE\n\n= 2,,2 R, - 4",2 + 2" L (R - "\n\nAp "\'2"R(L+2"\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE\n\nAINNER\nSKINS\n\n= 2" 2 ,N [ QR + (3Q2 - - , ]\n- 2 Q)\n\nALONGERONS = 4" N, (2 QR + 3Q2 r)\n\nARISERS = ",(N+1)(2QR + 3Q2,)\nLONGERONS\n\nFigure 7.- Habitat geometric relationships.\n\n42\n\nTABLE 4.- DESCRIPTION OF CONFIGURATIONS EVALUATED\nShape\n\ngmin\n\ngmax\n\n,\n\nR\n\nI.Y\n\nN\n\nAplperson\n\nVHIV T\n\nShape\n\ngrnin\n\ngmax\n\n-\n\nSphere\n\n{"\'"\n0\n\nCylinder\n\nr\n\n0.723\n.532\n.394\n.294\n0\n\nSphere\n\n0\n\nCylinder\n\nTorus\n\nCrystal\npalace\n\n70\n.50\n\n1\n\nCO\n\n.50\n.35\n.25\n\nCO\n\n.50\n.35\n.25\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n. ..\n\n0.02\n.04\n.10\n.23\n1.0\n\nSphere\n\n...\n...\n\nCylinder\n\n. ..\n. ..\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n73.61\n54.41\n40.27\n31.09\n\n4.064\n4.727\n5.495\n6.253\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n37.59\n32.32\n27.80\n24.43\n\n69.55\n49.68\n34.78\n24.84\n\n2.952\n2.540\n2.474\n2.500\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n2\n3\n4\n\n27.44\n34.15\n35.90\n35.93\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n201.41\n168.09\n147.92\n137.32\n125.35\n\n--.\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n--.\n\n--.\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n70\n\n.50\n1\n\nTorus\n\nr\nr\n.50\n.35\n.25\n\no\n\nCrystal\n\npalace\n\n.50\n.35\n.25 :\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n24.9\n17.8\n13.7\nt 1.8\n9.9\n\n190.04\n162.50\n134.08\n115.93\n\n1.00\n.97\n.96\n.95\n\n156.50\n111.78\n78.25\n55.89\n\n33.54\n50.72\n55.83\n60.04\n7.452\n8.694\n9.151\n8.731\n\n223.57\n\n...\n\n...\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n.97\n\n190.04\n167.67\n150.91\n136.31\n\n1.00\n.98\n.98\n.97\n\n156.50\n111.78\n78.25\n55.89\n\nSphere\n\n.50\n.35\n\n1.00\n1.00\n.99\n\n.25\n\n0.24\n.41\n.61\n.76\n1.0\n\n.94\n\n{"\'"\n0\n\n0\n\n--.\n--.\n\n--\'\n--.\n\n--.\n\n50.33\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n--.\n\nAplperson\n\nVHIV T\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n31.8\n24.2\n20.1\n18.4\n16.2\n\n...\n...\n\n4.40\n\n...\n\n31.8\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n33.54\n55.89\n72.66\n80.42\n7.424\n8.952\n9.420\n8.976\n\n...\n\n...\n\n0.36\n.55\n.73\n.83\n1.0\n.37\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n27.66\n18.Q9\n14.93\n13.78\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n17\n10\n8\n8\n\n30.12\n18.62\n14.10\n12.33\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n15.67\n10.65\n9.76\n8.77\n7.99\n\n0.36\n.65\n.74\n.87\n1.0\n\n0.36\n.65\n.80\n.87\n1.0\n.42\n.65\n\n164.58\n59.96\n12.14\n\n...\n...\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n--.\n\n--.\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n--.\n\n14.02\n10.36\n9.41\n8.75\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n8\n5\n4\n4\n\n14.24\n8.96\n6.76\n5.90\n\n499.39\n411.80\n394.07\n373.54\n356.63\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n10\' population, VH = 2000 m\' Iperson, I rpm (max)\n\n--\'\n\n--.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n. ..\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n. ..\n\n7.53\n5.12\n4.45\n4.21\n3.84\n\n709.42\n28.83\n\n...\n...\n\n7.84\n5.14\n\n1557.8\n710.24\n450.69\n322.37\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n8.72\n4.88\n3.91\n3.49\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n9\n15\n20\n23\n\n92\n63\n55\n51\n\n8.71\n5.24\n4.02\n3.47\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n3.49\n2.38\n2.03\n1.90\n1.78\n\n0.36\n.65\n.82\n.91\n1.0\n\n0\n\n1.00\n1.00\n.94\n.92\n0\n\n1094.45\n902.51\n841.37\n818.92\n781.59\n\n70\n1..50\n\n1.00\n1.00\n\n894.26\n894.26\n\n...\n\nCO\n\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n\n760.12\n670.70\n603.62\n558.92\n\n134.14\n223.57\n290.63\n335.35\n\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n\n625.98\n447.13\n312.99\n223.57\n\n,\n\n1.00\n.95\n.85\n.79\n\nN\n\n\'10 s population, VH = 19OOm\'/person, 1.5 rpm (max)\n\ni\n\n--.\n--.\n\n225.10\n195.77\n178.65\n170.40\n160.75\n\n1.00\n\n(""\n\no\n\n10 4 population.

The\ncrystal palace "r" radii shown in table 4 are obtained by\nselecting suitable integer values for the number of modules (N and Q) and solving for the required habitable\nvolume.\n\n-\n\n----\n\n-\n\n---------\n\nFSKIN\n\nRd8\n\nt\nRSit/J\n\nvts\n\nFigure 8.- Spherical shell analysis.\n\nSPHERE\nR\nPA\n(1M) 9maxkR\n- - - - - - - 2 - [ 2" + V (1000)\nH\nRP s 9max ksin 8\n1200\n\ntS ;\n\nm\n\n5\nin)2\n- 12 (9 max\n9\n\n+ Prad 9max k t\n1200 R\n\n17 Sin4 8\n20 .\n\nI\n\n.28+\n1\n(9min)S/FOR8>Sin-,(9min)\nSin\n15sin8 9max\n9max\n\nrad\n\nf.R + trad) . 28]\n2\nSin\n\n\\1\n\nCYLINDER\nFOR HEMISPHERICAL ENDS USE SPHERE EQUATIONS\n\n~ffLC9max\n\n+\n\nP rad 9max k\n\n1000R\n\ntrad\n\n(\n\nR +\n\nrad ]\n\nt\n""2)\n\nmfYl ; P s VOL ; 21TPs RL ts\nWHERE\nk\n\n9.80665 m/sec 2 (ACCELERATION OF EARTH GRAVITY)\n\nPA\n1M\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE (kPa) FROM TABLE 3\n\nVH\n\nINTERNAL MASS/PERSON (k9) FROM TABLE 3\nHABITABLE VOLUME/PERSON (m 3 ) FROM TABLE 3\n\nPrad\n\nDENSITY OF RADIATION SHIELDING (k9/m3)\n\ntrad\n\nTHICKNESS OF RADIATION SHIELDING (m)\n\nm,\n\nMASS OF STRUCTURAL SHELL (kg)\n\nFigure 9.- Habitat structural shell formulas.\n\n4S\n\n(j)\n\n+ P,ad t,ad 9max k ( Rmax\n\n"\n\nTORUS\n\n1000 Rmax\n\n(R~ax\n\nR~in)\nR\n\n-\n\n= U2IRmax +\nw\n\nmin\n\nI\n\n) PA\n\nPrad + PIM = PA\n\nWHERE:\n\n~ = _ _ _~~ [(IM)(g~~~m~n~ +\ns\nO"w\n\n+\n\nP s 9m in k Rmin\n\nP\'~O~~;~:~ad.

Sphere or cylinder - Shielding can either be\nattached or detached for all cases, and surrounds the\nstructural shell.\n2. Torus - Circular cross-section toroids can have\neither attached or detached shielding. Torii with cylindrical walls also have an attached/detached option, but\nmust either have sufficient shielding on the inner wall to\nequalize the internal pressure, or additional shell structure must be incorporated to sustain these compressive\nloads. All shielding configurations investigated were\ntoroidal and surrounded the structural shell.\n3. Crystal palace - Only detached shielding was evaluated for the crystal palace. Since the crystal palace\nemploys cables to react centrifugal loads, cylindrical\nrather than toroidal shielding was used.\nAll attached shielding was assumed to be immediately\nadjacent to the structural shell. Detached shielding was\nseparated by 1.5 m. Owing to the increased area of\nseparated shielding, its mass ranges from about 0.2 to\n\n4 percent more than that for attached shielding.

Our analysis shows considerable cost differences owing to overall\nhabitat material requirements, and between terrestrial\nsupplies and the various products manufactured in space\nfrom lunar material. Habitat cost comparison has been\nconducted by assuming that all habitat atmospheric\noxygen, pressure shell structure, and radiation shielding\nare derived from lunar resources. It was also assumed\nthat other items such as lighting fixtures are required in\nsufficient quantity so that they can be economically\nmanufactured from lunar materials. The only materials\nor products imported from Earth are those which are\neither unavailable in lunar resources, or which because of\ncomplicated manufacturing operations requiring expensive facilities coupled with relatively small quantity\nrequirements can be more economically obtained from\nEarth. Since the sensitivity studies in this analysis were\nconducted at a major subsystem rather than a component level, no complicated Earth products of this sort\nwere included. The special ground rules and assumptions\nused for costing of lunar and Earth habitat construction\nmaterials are as follows:\n1. Space processing and fabrication costs are\nobtained from data generated for the II-year space\nmanufacturing buildup period for the construction of\nsolar power satellites from lunar resources (ref. 5). This\ninformation was used in lieu of equilibrium data because\n\nit was obtained by more rigorous methods and is better\ndocumented. This approach is conservative for comparison with Earth imports because space manufacturing\nequilibrium costs should be somewhat lower.\n2. Space processing and fabrication costs are based\non the conversion of 1737 ktons of lunar material into\nuseful products. A total of 5745 man-years and\n$6.45 billion are expended to perform this conversion,\nthat is, personnel cost (including transportation and all\nsupport), equals $1.123 million/man-year.\n3. Material processing costs and fabrication costs\nconstitute 25 and 75 percent of this total expenditure,\nrespectively (R. Williams, personal communication,\n1977).\n4. Costs for each major space-manufactured product\nobtained from lunar material are shown in table 5. The\nconstituents of lunar material shown reflect some lunar\nbeneficiation prior to delivery to the space manufacturing facility (SMF). The processing and fabrication factors reflect the relative difficulty of manufacturing that\nparticular product (R. Williams, personal communication, 1977).\n5. Transportation costs from Earth to the SMF were\nderived for equilibrium conditions using third-generation\nlaunch vehicles. This approach is purposefully optimistic\nso that cost comparisons with space-manufactured products will be more conservative.\n6. A single-stage to orbit vehicle delivers payload in\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) at $47.06/kg, and a heavy massdriver reaction engine provides LEO to SMF transfer at\n$10.16/kg, for a total transportation cost of $57.22/kg\n(J. Engel, Dept. of Systems Engineering, Univ. of Illinois\nat Chicago, personal communication). For most items,\nthis transportation cost will be an order of magnitude\n\nabove the Earth purchase price, which has therefore\nbeen neglected.\n\nHabitat Structural Cost Comparison\nHabitat structural elements included in this comparison are the pressure shell and radiation shielding. Windows for illumination are evaluated later in this paper.\nInternal furnishings were not included because their allocated mass per person was assumed to be equal for all\npopulations within each of the two habitat classes. The\nsmaller habitat class, 10 2 and 104 populations without\nagriculture, used 43,000 kg/person internal furnishings.\nThe larger class, 104 and 106 populations with agriculture, all used 53,000 kg/person.\nTo provide better cost sensitivities for the larger-class\nhabitats, the radiation shielding thickness for the\n104 population configurations with agriculture was\nincreased from 1.08 to 2.04 m. In addition, spherical\nhabitats with 105 and 10 7 populations and shielding\n2.04 m thick were also included in an attempt to establish the habitat size for minimum cost per person. A\ngeometric definition of these added habitats is included\nin table 4.\nThe cost comparison performed assumes that all\nmaterials needed for the structural shell and radiation\nshield are obtained from processed lunar soil. The shell is\nassumed to be aluminum with a working stress of\n218,000 kPa at a cost of $7.05/kg, and the shielding,\nmolded industrial slag at $0.21/kg from table 5. If a\nsignificant percentage of shell alloying elements must be\nimported from Earth to meet the assumed working\nstress, then the shell costs must be increased accordingly.\n\nTABLE 5.- COST OF SPACE-MANUFACTURED MATERIALS\nProduct\nPercent of lunar\nmaterial\nProcessing factor\nProcessing cost,\n$/kg\nFabrication factor\nFabrication cost,\n$/kg\nTotal mfg. cost,\n$/kg\n\nOxygen\n\nShielding\n\n12.67\n2\n\n19.80\n0.5\n\n46.63\n0.1\n\n4.43\n1\n\n5.12\n1\n\n9.10\n1\n\n2.95\n2\n\n2.95\n2\n\n0.74\n0.05\n\n0.15\n\nom\n\n1.47\n1\n\n1.47\n1\n\n1.47\n1\n\n11.16\n\n11.16\n\n0.28\n\n0.06\n\n5.58\n\n5.58\n\n5.58\n\n14.11\n\n14.11\n\n1.02\n\n0.21\n\n7.05\n\n7.05\n\n7.05\n\nGlass\n\nSilicon\n\n2.25\n2\n\nTitanium\n\nIron\n\nAluminum\n\n51\n\nAll cost comparisons shown in figures 23 through 28\nare for habitats with unattached shielding and an intermediate atmospheric pressure of 51.7 kPa. Unattached\nshielding and intermediate atmospheric pressure were\nboth previously shown to result in reduced structural\nshell material requirements. Figure 23 shows the cost per\nperson of the shell and shielding structural components\nfor spherical habitats as a function of habitat size (population) and minimum g level. The shaded bands show the\ncost range from gmin = 0 to gmin = 0.7. It is interesting\nto note that the sltielding cost exceeds shell cost up to a\npopulation of about 10 5 ; for larger populations the\nreverse is true. Similar results were obtained for toroidal\nand crystal palace habitats.\nFigures 24 through 27 show cost as a function of\nhabitat size (population) for various habitat configurations at fixed minimum g values. The smaller-class habitats (radiation shielding thickness = 1.08 m) are characterized by a very wide configuration cost spread at\n102 popUlation, narrowing to $20,000/person difference\nat 104 population for all values of gmin- For the largerclass habitats (radiation shielding thickness = 2.04 m),\n\nSPHERICAL HABITATS\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n=\n\nthe minimum cost per person always occurs between\npopUlations of 10 5 and 10 6 except for the special case\nof zero-g spheres, where the cost per person continues to\ndecrease as population increases. The data for zero-g\nspherical habitats can be obtained by summing the lefthand curves of figure 23. For most values of minimum g,\ntoroidal habitats show a significant cost advantage\n($10,000 to $20,000/person) over spherical and crystal\npalace habitats. It must be noted, however, that both\ntoroidal and crystal palace habitat configurations require\nadditional hub structures, which have not been included\nin this analysis. These hub features include cargo vehicle\ndocking provisions, personnel access structure, and\nshielding alignment support structure, all of which are\ninherently provided by a spherical geometry. Also, as\nnoted previously, the geometric constraints employed\nfor this comparison result in toroids with cylindrical\nsections. With unattached shielding, these inner toroidal\nhabitat cylindrical walls are compressively loaded. The\nadditional structure required to prevent buckling was\nnot included in the "detached shielding" structural\nweights used.\n\ngmin = 0.7\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 51.7 kPa\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n51.7 kPa\n\nz\na\n\ni=\n\n~\n\nRADIATION SHIELDING\nTHICKNESS, m\n\n~~_t2.04\n\n!\n\n1.08\n\n\xc2\xab\n..J\n:::>\nQ..\n\na:\n\nRADIATION SHIELDING\nTHICKNESS, m\n\nt\n\n2.04\n.--~1.08\n\nRADIATION\nSHIELDING\nCOST\n\n40\n\n60\n80\nCOST/PERSON, $1000\n\nFigure 23.- Cost spread of spherical habitat stlUctural\ncomponents,\n\n52\n\n102 L-..--L---!::---llJr-:-::-=--~=---::!::--=--=\'9\no\n40\n80\n240\n280\n\nFigure 24.- Habitat cost comparison for gmin\n\n= 0.70.\n\n0.25\n\n!Im;n =\n\n!lmin\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n= 0.5\n= 51.7 kPa\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 51.7 kPa\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n105\n\n105\n\nZ\n0\n\nZ\n0\n\n>=\n\xc2\xab\n\n>=\n\xc2\xab\n\nRADIATION SHIELDING\nTHICKNESS, m\n\n-\'\n"0\n"-\n\n::;)\n\nt\n\n2.04\n\n10"\n\nRADIATION SHIELDING\nTHICKNESS, m\n\n-\'\n"0\n"-\n\n::;)\n\n104\n\n---!-1.08\n\n1o2L-----L-----L8----L-----~>_~L-----L-~~\n\no\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\nCOST/PERSON, $1000\n\nCOST/PERSON, $1000\n\nFigure 25.- Habitat cost comparison for gmin = 0.50,\n\nFigure 27.- Habitat cost comparison for gmin = 0.25.\n120\n\n110\n\nf\n\\\n\n!lmin\n\n=\n\n0.35\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 51.7 kPa\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n90\n\n\\ \\\n\\. \\\n\'\\ \\\n\n0\n0\n0\n\nI\n\n80\n\nz\xc2\xb7\n0\n\n(I)\n\nRADIATION SHIELDING\nTHICKNESS, m\n\n\\\n\nf\n\n2.04\n\n0\n\n1>\n\n106 SPHERE//\n/\n\n....\nu\n\n?\n\n//\n\n70\n\nw\n\nl!:\n(I)\n\n~-\n\n!\n\na:\n\nI\n\nI?\n\n;;;\n\n\\\n10"\n\nATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE = 51.7 kPa\nSHIELDING THICKNESS\n2.04 m\nSHIELDING UNATTACHED\n\n100\n\n60\n\n1.08\n\n,\n\nI\n\n./ .\n\n104 SPHERE\n\n~/\'.\n\n. -5/\n\n.-~\n\n~/-\n\n/\'/106 CRYSTAL\n/\nPALACE\nI/\n10 6 TORUS&-\n\n?\n\n/\n\n105 SPHERE\n\n--\n\n.I!l-"\n\nfi\n\n;//\n\n//\n\n/1\n\n// I\n\n///\n\nI\nI\n/\n\n/\n\n,,\'"\n\nY\n1020L----~----~----~6LO--~~8LO----~lOO~~~=---~~\nCOST/PERSON, $1000\n\nFigure 26.- Habitat cost comparison for gmin = 0.35.\n\ngmin\n\nFigure 28.- Habitat cost comparison as a function of\nminimum g level.\n\n53\n\nLarge class habitat costs as a function of minimum g\nlevel are shown in figure 28.

Toroidal and crystal\npalace habitats are efficient from an atmospheric volume\nstandpoint, and spherical and cylindrical habitats are\ninefficient since their total pressurized volumes exceed\nthe habitable volumetric requirements of their\npopulations.\nPossible habitat atmospheric compositions of oxygen\nand diluent were previously established as a function of\ntotal pressure and population (see figs.4 and 5 and\ntable 3). The oxygen for the habitat atmosphere will be\nrecovered during lunar material processing at the space\nmanufacturing facility. Since it is produced in large\nquantities at the habitat construction site, the cost of\noxygen is a reasonable $1.02/kg.\nPossible inert atmospheric constituents include nitrogen or helium. During early space-settlement efforts,\nthese diluents will probably be imported from Earth,\nwith a delivery cost of $57.22/kg. Since the cost of\natmospheric inerts is 56 times that of an equal quantity\nof oxygen, their use for large habitats will either be\nlimited or a non terrestrial source will be developed.\nSome scientists have suggested that volatiles may exist in\nfrozen form at the lunar poles, but a more probable\nsource is asteroidal material. It has been estimated that\nup to 0.3 percent of the mass of carbonaceous chondrite\nasteroids could be nitrogen (ref. 21). If nitrogen can be\nrecovered from a convenient extraterrestrial source, its\ncost should be approximately equal to that of oxygen.\nFigure 29 shows atmospheric cost sensitivity assuming that either nitrogen (N 2) or helium (He) diluents are\nimported from Earth. The cost of an 02/He atmosphere\nis significantly lower than an equivalent 02/N2 atmosphere since, at equal pressure, nitrogen is 7 times more\ndense, and is therefore equivalently more expensive to\ntransport. All the curves in figure 29 are for habitats\nwith total volume equal to habitable volume. Spheres\nand cylinders usually have total volumes greater than the\nhabitable volume as shown in the right-hand column of\nta ble 4. For example, a large spherical habitat\n6\n(I0 population), with a 51.7 -kPa atmosphere of O2 /N2\n\n54\n\n~\n\n....\n\n\'"\n8\n\n1,000\n\n/"\'"\n,//\n\n.....---\n\n_ _ 102 (240)\n\n\xc2\xb02 /He\n\n,/\n\n//\n\nI\n\n/\n\nI\n\n100\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\nPRESSURE, kPa\n\nFigure 29.- Habitat atmosphere cost sensitivity to\ncomposition and pressure.\nand minimum pseudogravity one-half Earth-normal, will\nhave a volume 1.5 times greater than shown, or a cost\nreVlSlon from $36,600 (shown in fig. 29) to\n$56,300/person.\nThe primary conclusion reached from this cost comparison is that if a Significant percentage (>20 percent)\nof a settlement atmosphere is imported from Earth, then\nthe cost of these diluents may be a major contributor to\ntotal habitat cost.\nHabitat Illumination Cost Comparison\nThe interior of a space habitat can be illuminated by\neither artificial lights powered by photovoltaic cells, or\nby natural sunlight admitted through windows. This\nstudy evaluated the costs of these alternative lighting\nmethods for one representative habitat configuration.\nSince the natural illumination choice is probably reasonable only for larger habitats, the 10,000-person spherical\nhabitat was selected for this evaluation. This sensitivity\nanalysis was performed only for photovoltaic versus\nnatural illumination, independent of habitat configuration and population variations. Further work should\nconsider possible configuration and population effects.\nArtificial /ighting- Recent solar photovoltaic array\nestimates use a specific power generation factor of\n138 W/kg (ref. 22). To account for power transmission,\n\nconditioning, and control equipment, an efficiency of\n90 percent was assumed for an effective array output of\n124 W/kg. Photovoltaic array cost was based on spacemanufactured components of 30 percent silicon and\nglass and 70 percent aluminum and other metals. The\ncost for light bulbs and fixtures was estimated using a\nspecific weight of 0.03 kg/W of rated fixture output.\nSpace-manufactured components were selected over\nEarth imports owing to the estimated acquisition cost\nratio of 1/6. Table 6 displays the weights and costs for\nthe various illumination system components. These calculations were based on the power requirements\n\nobtained from table 2. Weighted values were used for\narray sizing and maximum values for distribution fixtures. The use of maximum power requirements for\nfixtures reflects the difficulty in moving them as lighting\nneeds vary. As indicated, the cost of illuminating the\nagricultural area is an order of magnitude higher than\nthat for the living area. Of particular interest is the\noverwhelming influence of distribution costs, which\naccount for 88 percent of the total artificial lighting\ncost. If Earth-imported fixtures had been assumed, the\ndistribution cost would have exceeded $200 M, instead\nof the $33.73 Mused.\n\nTABLE 6.- HABITAT ILLUMINATION COMPARISON\nSystem and\ncomponent data\n\nArea illuminated\nAgricultural\n\nTotal\n\n0.56/0.93\n\n5.69/11.21\n\n6.25/12.14\n\nMass, kg\nCost, $M\n\n27,800\n44,900\n0.41\n\n284,000\n459,000\n4.21\n\n312,400\n503,900\n4.62\n\n{Mass, kg\nCost, $M\n\n281,700\n2.58\n\n3,397,000\n31.15\n\n3,678,700\n33.73\n\n3.0\n\n35.4\n\n38.4\n\n1.86\n\n5.69\n\n7.55\n\n610\n84,000\n1.19\n\n1860\n257,000\n3.63\n\n2470\n341,000\n4.82\n\n54,200\n10,800\n0.08\n\n165,300\n33,100\n0.23\n\n219,500\n43,900\n0.31\n\n610\n3,220,000\n0.68\n\n1860\n9,850,000\n2.07\n\n2470\n13,070,000\n2.75\n\n1.95\n\n5.93\n\n7.88\n\n.\n\nLiving\nArtificialligh t\n\nRequirement, kW /person\nPhotovoltaic\narray\nDistribution\n\n{Me., m\'\n\nTotal cost, $M\n\nNatural sunlight\nRequirement, kW /person\nGlass\nwindow\nMirrors\nand other\nequipment\nAdditional\nshield\n\nr,e.,m\'\n\nMass, kg\nCost, $M\n\nr,e.,m\'\n\nMass, kg\nCost, $M\n\n{Me., m\'\n\nTotal cost, $M\n\nMass, kg\nCost, $M\n\n55\n\n2500\n\nNatural illumination- The corresponding analysis for\ndetermining weight and cost of illuminating with natural\nsunlight is more difficult because of the many implementation options available. To reduce weight and the possibility of meteorite damage, it is desirable to minimize\nthe window area. This can be done by concentrating the\nsunlight before it enters the habitat, but the concentration is limited by the 800 K softening temperature of\nwindow glass. It was assumed that the maximum window temperature should be less than 600 K (337 C). To\nmaintain this temperature, the absorptivity of the glass\nmust be balanced by its conductivity. The energy\nadmitted to the habitat is also a function of window\nabsorptivity; specifically (refs. 23,24):\n\n2000\n\nI\n\n"-\n\n~E 1500\nI\n\n;:\n>\'\n\nd\n\nand\n\n/\n\nTOTAL ENERGY ABOVE EARTH\'S\nATMOSPHERE. 1390 W/m2\n\n<.:>\n\nII:\n\n0\n\nHAa=KA~\n\nENERGY IN VISIBLE\nSPECTRUM. 528 W/m 2\n\nE\n\nw\n\n~\n\n1000\n\nII:\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n...J\n\n~\n500\n\nQ = HA(1 - a)\no~~~~----L---~==~==~\n.2\n.5\n2.5\n3\n\nwhere\n\nWAVELENGTH.\n\nH\n\nflux of concentrated sunlight, cal/sec-cm2\n\nA\n\n~m\n\nwindow area, cm 2\n\nFigure 30.- Solar energy spectrum.\n\nvolume = Ad = 0.2 m 3 , where the glass density is\n2450 kg/m 3 \xe2\x80\xa2 This equation is solved simultaneously with\nthe structural equation for a pressure-loaded square plate\nwith simply supported edges:\n\na\n\nabsorptivity of glass\n\nK\n\nthermal conductivity of glass,\n0\n0.0025 cal\xc2\xb7cm 4 /cm-sec- C\n\nt2\n\nwindow temperature, 337 C\n\nt1\n\ntemperature of surrounding structures, 21 C\n\nd\n\nwindow thickness, cm\n\nQ\n\nrequired power in habitat, cal/sec-person\n\n\xc2\xb0max =~\n3.48d2\n\n0\n\nwhere\n0\n\n0max\n\nOnly sunlight in the visible waveband is useful for\nhabitat illumination. This constitutes 38 percent of the\ntotal solar radiation (fig. 30). Admitting energy outside\nthis band into the habitat results in many penalties,\nincluding the requirement for larger windows and\nincreased internal thermal control capacity. It is therefore desirable to use concentration mirrors that selectively reflect sunlight in the visible spectrum into the\nhabitat for illumination. The degree of allowable concentration is influenced by glass thermal limits and absorptivity, which are functions of glass thickness. The thickness of the window is determined by structural\nrequirements. Based on terrestrial manufacturing experience, the practical window weight limit is about 1 ton.\nA weight of 0.5 ton per window was selected or\n\n56\n\nworking stress (16.5 MPa for tempered window\nsheet)\n\np\n\npressure, 51.7 kPa\n\nA\n\nwindow area, cm 2\n\nd\n\nwindow thickness, cm\n\nThe solution resulted in a window 5.65 cm thick with\nan area of 3.5 m2 . The transmissibility of 5.65 -cm-thick\nglass is 0.84 in the visible wavelengths (ref. 25). Since\nthe sum of reflectivity, absorptivity, and transmissibility\nmust equal 1, an absorptivity of 0.16 may be conservatively assumed.\nThe total energy transmitted through the windows by\nselective mirrors is therefore 36.5 kW/m2 . This is equivalent to a solar visible energy concentration factor of 70.\nWindow areas, weights, and costs are delineated in\ntable 6. Illumination requirements were again obtained\n\nfrom table 2 with the following assumptions. Since distribution in living areas may be cumbersome, twice the\nmaximum energy/person allocation was used. Agricultural areas are relatively open and a simple swiveling\nmirror can control light, so the weighted power requirement was used.\nThe mirror estimates shown in table 6 were derived\nassuming 90 percent efficiency, a total concentration\nplus distribution factor of SO, and aluminum mirrors and\nsupport structure weighing 0.20 kg/m 2 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThere are several ways to provide radiation protection\nfor habitat windows: one alternative employs very thick\nglass windows that supply all the shielding necessary;\nthis is undesirable, however, since the thickness must be\n1.02 or 1.92 m to meet the 5.0 or 0.5 rem/yr dose rate\nrequirements, respectively. This increases the total\nabsorptivity, and these windows weigh and cost more\nthan 20 times those that are only 5.65 cm thick.\nAnother approach is to use shielding constructed from\nlunar slag in a chevron configuration to protect thin\nwindows. Comparable thicknesses are still needed but\nmaterial costs are 67 times lower and manufacturing\nrequirements are greatly simplified. Chevron construction requires about twice the amount of normal shielding, but as shown in table 6, the cost remains below that\nfor thin-glass windows.\nThe results of the preceding discussion and a comparison of total costs in table 6 lead to several conclusions:\n1. If natural illumination is used, it should be concentrated with selective mirrors before it is transmitted\ninto the habitat.\n2. Thick glass windows that supply radiation protection are expensive and impractical.\n3. Natural illumination should be used for agricultural areas since its cost is 1/6 that of artificial lighting.\n4. Natural illumination should also be considered for\nIi vi n g/ working areas unless distribution becomes\nawkward or expensive.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe introduction to this paper posed three questions\nto be addressed and, it is hoped, answered by these\nhabitat structural/cost sensitivity analyses. Sufficient\nhabitat options have been evaluated to obtain a quantitative answer to the initial question: How much do\n"Earth-normal" physiological conditions cost when\napplied to a space habitat structural design? Obviously,\nmany "less than Earth-normal" design options are possible, but a representative example should be illustrative.\n\nThe data in table 7 compare 106 population habitats\nhaving identical habitable volumes (2000 m 3 /person),\ninternal furnishings (53,000 kg/person), and radiation\nprotection (0.5 rem/yr). The variables noted in the table\nare limited to habitat configuration, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric composition, and the range of pseudogravity in the habitable volume.\nThe total costs obtained offer some interesting comparisons between conservative and reduced cost designs,\nas well as for alternative configurations. As shown, when\nonly habitat structure, shielding, and atmosphere are\ncompared, the conservative to reduced cost design ratio\nis 7.5, 4.S, and 3.5 for spherical, toroidal, and crystal\npalace habitats, respectively. The answer to the first\nquestion is that design costs associated with Earthnormal conservatism are at least significant and may, in\nfact, be excessive. Also, table 7 cost data shows that the\ncost dispersion for conservative designs varies by more\nthan a factor of 2.2 due to configuration differences, but\nthe dispersion for reduced cost designs varies by only\n1.4. This reduction in configuration sensitivity demonstrated by the lower cost habitat designs is due primarily\nto the reduced effect of their atmospheric costs.\nThe second question asks which "less than Earthnormal" physiological conditions offer the greatest habitat cost savings. Minimum g-level constraints and atmospheric pressure have strongly synergistic effects on\nstructural shell design requirements and costs. The\nselected habitable g range significantly affects the overall\nstructural shell geometry as demonstrated in table 4,\nwhile pressure affects the structural shell thickness.\nWhen evaluated independently, these influences are of\nthe same magnitude. The structural mass difference for a\n106 population spherical habitat is 4.7X 106 tons for a\ngmin range from 0.7 to 0.25. This difference is due to\ngeometry effects; it is not caused by a change in rotation\nrate, which varies only between 0.9 and 1.0 rpm. Similarly, the mass difference over the 76 kPa atmospheric\npressure range is S.lX106 tons and 3.7Xl06 tons for\ngmin values of 0.7 and 0.25, respectively. Similar results\nare obtained for toroidal and crystal palace habitat\ngeometries. Shielding mass and its resultant cost at a\nfixed popUlation and radiation requirement are influenced solely by habitat geometry, which is a function of\nminimum g-level. The relative importance of structural\nshell and radiation shielding costs is also a function of\nhabitat population. Below lOS inhabitants, shielding\ncosts are higher, but above 106 inhabitants, structural\nshell costs are dominant.\nThe quantity of atmosphere diluent imported from\nEarth has the largest potential influence on habitat cost.\n\n57\n\nTABLE 7.- EXAMPLE HABITAT COST COMPARISON\n\nEnvironmental\nparameter\n\nEarth normal\nconservative designs\nSphere\n\nAtmospheric pressure, kPa\nAtmospheric composition\nMinimum g level\n\nTorus\n\nCrystal\npalace\n\nRepresentative reducedcost habitat designs\nSphere\n\n101.3\n02/ N 2\n0.7\n\nTorus\n\nCrystal\npalace\n\n5l.7\n02/ He\n0.35\n\nHabitat }\nstructure\n\nMass, kT\nCost, $B\n\n15,300\n107.6\n\n9,300\n65.3\n\n9,200\n65.1\n\n5,500\n38.6\n\n3,200\n22.7\n\n5,200\n36.3\n\nSoP"\'" }\nradiation\n\nMass, kT\nCost, $B\n\n80,200\n16.8\n\n100,700\n21.1\n\n81,600\n17.1\n\n45,500\n10.0\n\n55,200\n11.6\n\n58,700\n12.3\n\nAtmosphere volume ratio\nCost, $B\n\n2.78\n293.0\n\n1.00\n105.5\n\n1.00\n105.5\n\n1.25\n7.2\n\n1.00\n5.8\n\n1.00\n5.8\n\nTotal cost, $B\n\n417.4\n\n19l.9\n\n187.7\n\n55.8\n\n40.1\n\n54.4\n\nshielding\n\nNotes: 10 6 population; VH = 2,000 m 3 /person; 1M = 53,000 kg/person; trad = 2.04 m (dosage\nlimit of 0.5 rem/yr); atmosphere volume ratio = total volume/habitable volume.\nThe mass which must be imported depends on excess\nhabitat volume, total atmospheric pressure, and the inert\ngas selected. These factors combined produce a cost\nfactor of 40 for the spherical habitat example given in\ntable 7.\nIllumination alternatives also exhibit substantial habitat cost effects. The use of unselected/unconcentrated\nnatural solar lighting results in window plus extra shielding costs similar in magnitude to those for the basic\nhabitat structure. The costs for this technique are two\norders of magnitude higher than for a selected/\nconcentrated natural illumination system.\nThe third question, regarding identification of a\nrecommended habitat configuration, has not been fully\nresolved by the limited analyses conducted during this\ninvestigation. Each habitat shape offers benefits for certain applications, and configuration selection may well\ndepend on design considerations outside the scope of\nthis study. ~hese considerations include implementation\nof life-support functions, power supply, waste heat dissipation, shielding alignment, docking functions, and\nillumination for each of the habitat configurations.\nAlthough an overall best habitat configuration has\nnot been recommended, some interesting configuration\ncomparisons can be made:\n\n58\n\n1. Torus - Offers the lowest habitat basic structural\ncost (pressure shell and detached radiation shielding) for\nalmost all combinations of population and gmin. It is\nalso volumetrically efficient and contains only as much\natmosphere as required. Unfortunately, several parts of\nthe torus structure were not included in this analysis:\nspokes, hub, shielding alignment, and additional stiffening needed in compressively loaded cylindrical sections.\nAlso the distribution of illumination in a torus appears\ncumbersome. These factors will combine to increase the\nbasic torus structural cost so that its cost per person\napproaches that for spherical habitats.\n2. Crystal Palace - Has attributes and disadvantages\nsimilar to the torus. Its basic structural cost always\nexceeds that for the torus and is less than that for\nspheres when gmin exceeds 0.5. It is atmospherically\nefficient but has illumination distribution difficulties\nand requires unestimated spoke and hub structures. The\ncrystal palace cylindrical radiation shielding, which contributes to its high basic structural cost, also offers\nseveral potential advantages. Its flat ends provide structure for spin axis alignment, and also radiation protection for the unpressurized volume within the crystal\npalace\'s inner structural wall. If additional facilities for\n\nspace manufacturing were placed within this volume,\nthey would be provided free radiation protection.\n3. Sphere - Has a basic structural cost which exceeds\nthat of the torus and crystal palace over most of the\npopulation and gmin ranges. It also exhibits an inefficient volume ratio, which results in high atmosphere\ncosts. Its advantages include straightforward illumination\ndistribution and no need for separate hub or shielding\nalignment structure. The sphere\'s excess pressurized and\nshielded volume could become advantageous by locating\nspace manufacturing facilities in this region.\nOne important discovery about habitat configurations\nwas made during this work: based on habitat basic\nstructural cost, the cost per person has a minimum for\nhabitats in the 105 to 10 6 population range. Even more\ninteresting is the fact that this minimum is independent\nof habitat configuration; spheres, toroids, and crystal\npalaces all had minimum costs in this population range.\nThis minimum is obviously dependent on the ground\nrules and scope of this investigation, but an equivalent\nminimum should also exist for revised ground rules and\nfor more extensive habitat subsystem considerations.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nPhysiological research should be concentrated in\nthose areas where less than Earth-normal conditions\noffer the greatest savings in habitat cost. Based on the\nwork conducted during these sensitivity analyses, recommended research falls into two categories: (1) that necessary to validate our assumptions and (2) that highlighted\nby our results. Our assumptions included allowable habitat rotation rates for pseudo gravity , and the use of a\nbroad range of habitable g levels. Since higher angular\nvelocities and broad habitable g ranges result in smaller,\nless massive, and lower cost habitats, it is very important\nthat we fully understand the long-term physiological\neffects of these conditions. Specifically, the following\nresearch is needed:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rotation rates: The angular velocities used for this\nstudy were based on work performed in a 1 g\n(Earth surface) environment. Initial human adaptation, long-duration habitability effects, and transition effects between rotating and nonrotating\nenclosures must be obtained in a reduced g\nenvironment.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 g-level variations: As inhabitants move radially\nwithin a settlement with a broad habitable-g band\n\n(0.25 --+ 1 g), they will be subjected to continuous\nor stepped g-level variations. This effect, with\nspecial emphasis on human adaptation and transition, must be investigated.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low-g tolerance: More knowledge is required on\nlong-duration physiological effects of low- and\nzero-g habitation. Experimental data are limited to\nthose obtained during the 84-day Skylab mission.\nThe results of our sensitivity analyses indicate that\nthe combined influence of atmospheric pressure and\ncomposition have potentially the most significant effect\non habitat cost. Therefore the following research is\nrecommended:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low atmospheric pressure: Perform extended\nduration and adaptability testing for 02/N2 mixtures at less than sea-level pressure. Evaluate\nspeech transmission effects in addition to respiratory effects.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low-density diluent: Conduct tests similar to\nthose above for 02/He atmospheres at less than\nsea-level pressure.\nAs repeatedly pointed out in the preceding text, this\nhabitat sensitivity investigation was limited to. the basic\nhabitat structure (pressure shell and radiation shielding)\nplus some considerations of atmospheric composition\nand habitat illumination. It is recommended that additional habitat sensitivity studies be performed to expand\nthis work.

SHETTLER\n\nA detailed scenario for the initiation of a space manufacturing enterprise using lunar materials to construct solar\npower satellites (SPS) has been developed, with particular attention to habitat design and logistic support requirements.\nIf SPS\'s can be constructed exclusively from lunar materials, the entire enterprise can be initiated in a 7-year period of\nlaunch activity (beginning as early as 1985) using the Space Shuttle and a low-cost, Shuttle-derived heavy lift vehicle. If\nadditional chemical feedstocks must be imported from Earth in significant quantities, it may be necessary to bring the\nnext-generation launch vehicle (single-stage-to-orbit) into operation by 1991. The scenario presented features use of the\nmass-driver reaction engine (MDRE) for orbit-to-orbit transfer of cargos and makes extensive use of the expendable\nShuttle external propellant tanks.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the last 3 years, a number of studies have\nshown the technical feasibility of manufacturing solar\npower satellites (SPS) at a space manufacturing facility\n(SMF) using lunar materials during the next two decades\n(refs. 1-5). These and related studies have provided conceptual designs and analyses for large-scale habitats in\nthe Earth-Moon system, for chemical and metallurgical\nextraction and processing from lunar materials, and for a\nmass driver, an electromagnetic catapult to be installed\non the lunar surface to launch raw materials into space\nat rates up to 600,000 metric tons per year (refs. 6-10).\nIn addition, a bench-top prototype mass driver has been\ndesigned, built, tested, and publicly demonstrated\n(ref. 11).\nHere we report on a study of the logistical feasibility\nof starting such a space manufacturing enterprise within\nthe constraints of the Space Shuttle and of a simple\nShuttle-derived heavy lift vehicle (SDjHLV) of higher\npayload capacity during the period 1985 through 1991.\nIn addition, we have investigated the logistic support\nrequired to sustain such an enterprise in a steady state\nthereafter. This scenario and the dates given above are\n\npurely hypothetical, serving principally to indicate that\nsuch an enterprise need not be relegated to a distant\nfuture and to provide a detailed baseline for trade-off\nstudies.\nA key element in the system is the use of a massdriver reaction engine (MDRE) as an upper stage for the\nSpace Shuttle to carry large payloads from low Earth\norbit (LEO) to high Earth orbits or to low lunar orbit\n(LLO) (ref. 12). Since the MDRE can accept any solid or\nliquid substance as a propellant, it can be optimized to\nuse powder fabricated from the expendable external\nliquid propellant tank of the Space Shuttle. Thus optimized, an MDRE can deliver to lunar orbit the payloads\nfrom nearly 30 Shuttle launches in a round trip of\n6 months duration. The mature Shuttle system is\nexpected to provide 30 launches every 6 months, beginning about 1985. Each MDRE payload to lunar orbit can\nthus total 850 metric tons, expending 1050 tons of reaction mass fabricated from 30 external tanks.\nThe entire space manufacturing system thus consists\nof (I) a lunar mining and launching base to deliver raw\nmaterials into space; (2) a catcher in space to collect the\nmaterials launched from the lunar surface; (3) a space\nmanufacturing facility that extracts useful materials\n\n61\n\nfrom the lunar ores and fabricates solar power satellites\nand other objects required to support and expand the\nsystem; (4) a staging base in LEO that provides an interface between the Earth-launch vehicles and the interorbital vehicles; (5) habitats at each of these locations; and\n(6) logistic support for the entire operation.\nLogistic support includes (1) Earth-launch vehicles\n(beginning with the Shuttle); (2) a fleet of MDRE\'s to\ntransfer cargos between various space facilities;\n(3) chemically propelled orbital transfer vehicles (OTV)\nto transport people between space facilities; (4) chemically propelled lunar transfer vehicles (LTV) to soft\xc2\xb7land\ncargos on the lunar surface and to transport people\nbetween lunar orbit, the lunar surface, and the catcher;\nand (5) passenger modules to carry large numbers of\npassengers in the Shuttle and on the OTV. In addition,\nthe enterprise must have a large infrastructure on Earth\nto provide administration and control, recruitment and\ntraining of personnel, coordination of research and\ndevelopment activities, procurement of materiel and services, and marketing of solar power satellites and maintenance services for them.\nA fairly detailed step-by-step consideration of how\nthe entire operation can be initiated has been carried out\nfor the first 8 years of launch activities. The result of\nthis effort has been to show the logistical feasibility of\ninitiating a space manufacturing enterprise within the\nconstraints of the Space Shuttle, a Shuttle-derived heavy\nlift vehicle, and the MDRE during the period 1985\nthrough 1990, with advanced launch vehicles brought\ninto operational use by 1991; to detail personnel and\nhardware requirements during this initial period; to\ndetermine the habitat requirements for each space facility in the system; to highlight certain key probiems for\nintensive research and development which would facilitate or improve the system; and to provide cost estimates for research and development, for materiel and\nservices procuremen t, for crew selection, training, and\nemployment, for administration and other overhead\ncosts, and for transportation.\nWe are grateful for the assistance of Edward H. Bock,\nFred Lambrou, Jr., and Michael Simon. Joe W.\nStreetman of General Dynamics/Convair Division provided extensive assistance in the analysis of chemically\npropelled vehicles and their missions.\nSCENARIO DEVELOPMENT\nThe scenario for the initiation of a space manufacturing enterprise has been developed around three key\nmilestones:\n\n62\n\n1. Establishment of the lunar base and operation of\nthe lunar mass driver at a launch rate of 30,000 metric\ntons/yr.\n2. Establishment of an initial space manufacturing\nfacility with a processing capacity of 30,000 metric\ntons/yr.\n3. Expansion of the entire system to a capacity of\n600,000 metric tons/yr with a work force of 3000 at the\nSMF producing 2.4 solar power satellites per year, each\nwith a capacity of 10 GW.\nTo minimize the total time and total costs incurred\nbefore investment return, the second milestone is phased\nto coincide with the first delivery of lunar materials at\nthe SMF. Thereafter, the entire system is bootstrapped\nto higher levels by diverting some of the lunar materials\ndelivered to the SMF into reaction mass for the MDRE\nfleet, permitting more rapid expansion of the system\nthan would be possible if the only source of reaction\nmass were the Shuttle external tanks.\nThe scenario was developed by working backward\nfrom each of the major milestones described above. The\ntotal masses required to achieve the first two milestones\nare sufficiently large to justify establishment of an\ninhabited station at LEO where MDRE\'s can be assembled, payloads from Earth-launch vehicles can be reconfigured, and large space structures such as habitats can\nbe built. The establishment of the LEO station is thus a\n"zeroth" milestone.\nThe basic working assumptions used to develop the\nscenario were as follows:\n1. The entire enterprise is self-contained, that is, no\nassumption is made that an essential piece of hardware\n(such as the LEO station) will already be in place as a\nresult of some other space program. Only the basic\nSpace Shuttle system is given.\n2. Once launch operations begin, the entire program\nis to be carried out as rapidly as possible within the\nconstraints of available transportation systems.\n3. Each Shuttle or SD/HLV brings its expendable\nexternal tank into orbit. To the maximum extent possible, these tanks are to be utilized for MDRE propellant\nor for pressure hulls.\n4. Initial masses at each facility are to be kept as\nsmall as reasonably possible.\n5. Research, design, development, and procurement\nare to be paced by deployment schedules, even if this\nresults in higher technical risk due to high levels of\nconcurrency.\nTo describe the scenario and its generation, the following sections will describe the initial operations at the\nMoon, at LEO, and at the SMF.\n\nINITIAL LUNAR OPERATIONS\nA site for the initial lunar base must natu~ally be\nselected before the first crew arrives at lunar orbit to\nbegin soft-landing equipment and supplies. At the present time, the likely site for the initial base is in the\nvicinity of the lunar equator and long. 33.1 \xc2\xb0 E. This\nlocation permits launch of lunar materials via a family of\nachromatic trajectories that arrive with minimum dispersion at a moving spot in space in the neighborhood of\nthe second Lagrange lib ration point L2 some 63,000 km\nbehind the Moon on the Earth-Moon axis (ref. 13). If\nprecise site selection has not been accomplished by prior\nlunar orbiter missions, the first MDRE payload arriving\nat lunar orbit (nearly 1 year before arrival of the first\nlunar crew) can include one or more lunar orbiters\ntotaling several tons. These could provide detailed spectrographic and topographic mapping of candidate sites\nand high-resolution maps (down to 1 m or less) of the\nfinal site.\nThe initial lunar crew, arriving at lunar orbit aboard a\nchemical OTV at the same time as the last MDRE\npayload of initial lunar base supplies and equipment\narrives, begins a series of LTV flights down to the main\nlunar base shortly after sunrise at the main lunar base on\n4 March 1987. (Dates for sunrise and sunset at the lunar\nbase (lunar long. 33.1\xc2\xb0 E, lat. 0\xc2\xb0) were computed from\nref. 14.) During this period of a few days to a week, the\ncrew continues to live in the OTV passenger module\nuntil the lunar base is habitable. The first payload to be\nlanded on the Moon includes the photovoltaic arrays and\nenergy storage systems needed to provide power for the\nlunar habitats throughout the lunar day and night. The\nentire energy system must be deployed rapidly to\naccumulate sufficient energy to support the crew\nthrough the first lunar night. At the present time, fused\nsilica flywheels appear to offer the least massive energy\nstorage system, storing about 0.87 kWhr/kg of flywheel,\nbut trade-off studies against alternatives should be performed. The next task at the main lunar base is to dig\ntrenches for the habitats and to bury them under several\nmeters of lunar soil to provide radiation shielding and\nthermal insulation. Meanwhile, a smaller contingent of\nthe lunar crew soft-lands equipment and supplies at a\nsecond site about 150 km downrange where the velocities of the packages of lunar material launched by the\nmass driver will be fine-tuned in ballistic flight by electrostatic means (ref. 10). A smaller habitat is established\nthere in the same manner.\nDuring the next two lunar days, the crew surveys both\nsites, installs the mass driver and the electrostatic trajec-\n\ntory correction equipment, surveys an initial mining site\nnear the mass driver, and tests the mass driver system.\nThe mass driver would be preassembled at LEO into\n30- or 40-m-Iong sections, thereby minimizing installation time. Initial mining activities consist of one small\nbulldozer and two small trucks working one 8-hr shift\nevery 24 hr during the lunar day, providing 30,000 tons\nof sieved material per year for launch by the mass driver.\nThe downrange crew returns to the main lunar base for\nthe lunar night, using a fleet (for redundancy) of longrange surface vehicles.\nAnalogies with terrestrial excavation and construction\nprojects suggest that this work schedule can be accomplished by an initial crew of 24. The mass budget for the\nhabitats, energy systems, consumables (food; gases and\nwater to make up for losses in recycling through leaks\nand by airlock inefficiencies), lunar surface vehicles, and\nmass driver system components is summarized in table 1.\n(Mass estimates for habitats, energy systems, etc., are\ndiscussed in a later section.)\nSoft-landing this equipment on the lunar surface\nrequires a substantial amount of chemical propellants in\nlunar orbit. No studies have been made to optimize the\ncapacity of a lunar transfer vehicle (LTV); we have\narbitrarily assumed a large cargo and personnel LTV as\ndescribed in table 2. Eleven rour i trips are needed for\nthe main base and two round trips for the downrange\nstation; allowing three more trips between LLO and the\nsurface for unforeseen contingencies, 896 tons of pre pellant are needed to start lunar surface operations.\nThe packages of lunar materials launched by the mass\ndriver must be collected in space with high efficiency. As\ndescribed earlier, the dispersion of packages arriving at\nthe catcher can be minimized by selecting a suitable\nlaunch site and catcher orbit. The catcher orbit thus\nselected is approximately a circle of radius 10,000 km\naround L2 in a plane normal to the Earth-Moon axis. To\ntrack this orbit while compensating for the momentum\nimparted to the catcher by arriving packages, a small\nfraction of the captured lunar materials can be used as\nreaction mass. Either a mass driver or a rotary pellet\nlauncher could be used for this purpose (see ref. 2,\npp. 80, 129-132), but engineering trade-offs remain to\nbe done. The catcher would thus be designed to operate\nautomatically under normal conditions, with remote\nmonitoring and capabilities for remote override and\ncontrol.\nNonetheless, maintenance of the catcher and transfer\nof accumulated lunar materials to a MDRE for transport\nto the SMF requires human operations on the catcher\nfor a few days at a time. The catcher thus includes a\n\n63\n\nTABLE 1.- MASS BUDGET FOR INITIAL\nLUNAR SURFACE OPERATIONS\nMass budget,\nmetric tons\n\nComponent\nMain lunar base (24 persons)\nHabitat (two LH2 tanks, furnished)\nEnergy system (photovoltaic arrays, flywheels)\nSurface vehicles and tools\nSpare parts\nConsumables (3 kg/day/person)\nMass driver and power supply (ref. 12)\nTotal\n\n25\n625\n880\n\nDownrange station (12 persons, part-time occupancy)\nHabitat (one LH2 tank, furnished)\nEnergy system\nSurface vehicles and tools\nSpare parts\nConsumables (lunar day only)\nMass driver trajectory correction system (ref. 12)\nTotal\n\n40\n45\n12\n2\n7\n50\n156\n\nCrew and personal baggage (300 kg/person)\n\nhabitat that can accommodate small crews (up to about\n12). Crews for this work travel to the catcher from the\nlunar surface once a lunar day (13 lunar days per year)\nfor routine maintenance when mass-driver operations\ncease for the lunar night at the main lunar base. A small\nLTV can be used for this purpose, with characteristics as\nshown in table 2. The LTV refuels in lunar orbit both on\nascent and on descent. Allowing two additional contingency flights per year, the propellants required for this\npurpose amount to 186 tons/yr, supplied from LEO\ninitially.\nOne additional system requires chemical propellants\nin lunar orbit, nam~ly, the OTV for personnel transport\nbetween LEO and LLO. Given the advantages of using\nthe MORE for cargo transportation beyond LEO, the\nOTV can minimize its propellant requirements by refueling in lunar orbit for the return trip to LEO. One such\nflight mllst be provided at the end of a I-year tour of\nduty in space for the lunar crew to return to Earth. For\nemergencies and unforeseen contingencies, we have\nallowed two additional flights per year. The OTV specifications assumed are given in table 2. For simplicity, we\nhave assumed a single-stage vehicle; no trade-off has been\ndone against a two-stage vehicle with refueling at LEO\n\n64\n\n72\n128\n25\n\n5\n\n7.2\n\nand at LLO. Total propellants at lunar orbit amount to\n165 tons for the first year.\nThe catcher is delivered to lunar orbit along with\nequipment and supplies for the lunar surface aboard the\nMORE. After delivery of the final payload to lunar\norbit, the MORE carries the catcher out to the vicinity\nof L2 and waits there with the catcher. Initial launch\nbegins at sunrise of the fourth lunar day (1 June 1987)\nat a rate of 30,000 tons/yr. At sunset on the eighth lunar\nday (11 October 1987), the MDRE departs for the SMF\nsite with a cargo of 11,700 tons of lunar materials. The\nMDRE also carries along one empty propellant storage\ndepot whose contents have been expended in softlanding the lunar base equipment and supplies. This\ndepot will be refilled at LEO.\nSince the chemical propellants must be stored in\nspace for periods of many months, suitable long-term\ncryogenic depots must be provided. A Shuttle external\ntank set has a capacity of 703 tons of liquid oxygen and\nliqUid hydrogen propellants. By adding multilayered\ninsulation, reliquefication systems to convert hydrogen\nand oxygen vapors back into liquid form, and eqUipment\ninside the tanks to permit extraction of the propellants\nfrom these tanks in zero-gravity conditions, these tank\n\nTABLE 2.- SPECIFICATIONS FOR CHEMICALLY\nPROPELLED SPACE VEHICLES\nLarge lunar transfer vehicle\nStage mass\nPropellant mass (LLO to surface and return)\nStage mass fraction\nPayload down to lunar surface\nCabin (pressurizable for crew of two)\nFlight time (LLO to surface or return)\n\n7 tonsa\n56 tons\n0.89\n81 tons\n5 tons\n0.93 hr\n\nN.B.

Specific impulse of\n462 sec was assumed for major burns, 400 for midcourse maneuvers, and\n220 for attitude control. (These specific impulses are slightly conservative,\nallowing for some propellant losses by boiloff) A common engine can be\nused for all of these vehicles, except that the engine throttling system\nrequired for the LTV\'s is not installed on the OTV engines.\na All in metric tons.\n\n65\n\nsets can be converted into long-term storage depots.

This includes 125 tons of Shuttle external\ntankage, so that only 2575 tons must be delivered to\nLEO in the Shuttle cargo bay. Since the MDRE can\nobtain the reaction mass for the return leg of its last trip\nfrom lunar materials at the catcher, the propellant mass\nrequired for this leg can be used on the outbound leg for\nabout 150 tons of additional cargo. The total mass of\n2700 tons can thus be accommodated on three MDRE\nTABLE 3.- MASS BUDGET FOR INITIAL\nLUNAR OPERATIONS\n\nComponent\nMass in lunar orbit\nMain lunar base\nDownrange station\nPropellants\nLarge LTV\n896\nSmall LTV\n186\nOTV\n165\nPropellant storage depots (2)\nShuttle external tank set\n33.45\nConversion materials\n4.15\nCatcher ensemble\nHabitat\n45\nEnergy system\n20\nConsumables\n7\nCatcher\n168\nLarge lunar transfer vehicles (2)\nSmall lunar transfer vehicles (2)\nGeneral contingency\n\nMass budget,\nmetric tons\n\n880\n156\n1247\n\n75.2\nINITIAL LEO OPERATIONS\n\n250\n\n24\n14\n63.8\n\nTotal payloads for MDRE\nShuttle external tanks\n\n2700\n-125\n\nTotal payloads for Shuttle\n\n2575\n\nMass at LEO\nOrbital transfer vehicles (2)\nPropellants\nPropellant depot conversion materials\nTotal payloads for Shuttle\n\n66\n\nflights with payloads of 850,850, and 1000 tons, respectively. Once the zeroth milestone has been reached,\n88.8 Shuttle payloads of 29 tons each are required to\nassemble the initial lunar orbit payloads at LEO. The\nliquid hydrogen tanks from four Shuttle external tank\nsets are used to build habitats; two complete external\ntank sets are converted into propellant depots; and\n85.7 external tank sets (including unused portions of\nthose tank sets used for habitat construction) are ground\nup for MDRE reaction mass.\nThe lunar crew must also be transported to lunar\norbit to arrive simultaneously with the third MDRE\nflight, approximately 5 months after departure of the\nMDRE from LEO. During the intervening time, a chemical propellant depot must be prepared at LEO, chemical\npropellants electrolyzed and liquefied from water\nbrought up aboard the Shuttle, and two chemical orbital\ntransfer vehicles brought up from Earth. One OTV is\nsufficient to deliver the initial lunar crew of 24 from\nLEO to LLO aboard a passenger module that can fit\ninside the Shuttle cargo bay, but a second OTV is\nessential for rescue capability. Propellants required for\nthe first year of OTV operations (matching those provided at lunar orbit) total 165 tons. The total mass\nrequired in LEO for crew delivery to the lunar base is\nalso shown in table 3.\n\n13\n165\n4.15\n182\n\nBefore launch of supplies and equipment for the\ninitial lunar operations can begin, facilities must be\nestablished in LEO to provide a staging base for assembly of lunar orbit payloads. During the year and a half of\nShuttle launches required to transport the lunar supplies\ninto orbit, the crew at the LEO station must refurbish\nfour liquid hydrogen fuel tanks into habitats for the\nlunar surface bases and for the catcher; convert two\ncomplete external tank sets into long-term propellant\nstorage depots; grind 85.7 external tanks into powder\nfor MDRE reaction mass; electrolyze nearly 1250 tons\nof water; liquefy the resulting hydrogen and oxygen;\nassemble the lunar mass driver and its enclosing tunnel\ninto sections 30 or 40 m long; assemble the catcher\nensemble; and bolt all of these payloads together into\npredetermined configurations designed for ease of transfer to the LTV, with due consideration for weight and\nbalance limits both of the MDRE and the LTV. Assembly and checkout of the MDRE are also essential tasks\nfor the LEO crew during this period.\n\nSome of this work involves assembly of prefabricated\ncomponents; most of it requires tending and maintaining\nautomated or semiautomated equipment (such as the\nelectrolysis and cryogenics units that produce chemical\npropellants). Refurbishing one liquid hydrogen tank for\na habitat (as seen below in the discussion of habitat\ndesign) is comparable to assembling three prefabricated\nhouses of 1800 ft2 each. a task of a few weeks for a few\nskilled workers. Such considerations suggest that a crew\nof 24 is sufficient during the 18-month period required\nto assemble the initial lunar orbit payloads, with an\naverage productivity requirement of 460 kg/day/worker.\nAs shown below, the work force at LEO must be\nexpanded to about 48 sometime after departure of the\nthird MDRE payload for lunar orbit. Four liquid hydrogen tanks can adequately house this size crew; 6 tanks\nwould be ample, leaving room for further expansion to\n84. We have adopted a six-tank configuration. Construction of the LEO station begins by refurbishing a\nsingle tank, working out of the Shuttle at first. Five\nworkers can ride aboard the Shuttle as passengers on\n6- to 8-day flights, with minimal decrease in cargo bay\npayload capacity. Using the LEO station\'s own solar\npanels to supplement the Shuttle power supply, the\nShuttle would provide life support initially until habitability is established for at least one liquid hydrogen tank.\nInterior fittings such as antislosh baffles must be\nstripped out of the tank, and air-conditioning ducts,\nprefabricated floor and wall panels, and other interior\nfittings must be moved inside. This can be done through\na special hatch installed before launch or cut in the tank\nin LEO for later installation of an airlock. Additional\nholes must be cut for attachment of the environmental\ncontrol/life-support system (EC/LSS) pods; these pods\nand the airlock welded to the hull; photovoltaic arrays\nand radiators mounted; and the entire hull pressurized.\nInstallation of floors, walls, air-conditioning ducts,\nplumbing, electrical wiring, elevators, and furnishings\ncan then proceed in a shirtsleeve environment, with\nstructural attachments made to the interior ribs of the\ntank. Once minimum habitability for 5 has been\nreached, the 5 workers aboard the current Shuttle flight\ncan remain in orbit, the remainder of the initial LEO\ncrew of 24 joining them during the next four Shuttle\nflights. The hydrogen tank can then be separated at\nleisure from the rest of the external tank set which is\nground up into MDRE reaction mass.\nDuring the following weeks, refurbishing of the first\ntank is completed, and work can begin on the other five\ntanks for the LEO station, beginning, in these cases, by\nseparating the hydrogen tank from the rest of the exter-\n\nnal tank set. The hydrogen tanks are connected by a\ntunnel, a docking hub, and cables, and rotated to provide 1 g in the hydrogen tanks themselves. Completion\nof this and subsequent habitats would be facilitated by\nuse of a "space caisson ," a collarlike structure that\nencircles a Shuttle external tank to provide a shirtsleeve\nenvironment for work outside the pressurized tank\nsimultaneously with work in progress inside. The caisson\nhas inflatable cuffs to form an airtight seal with the\nexterior of the tank and contains arc-welding equipment\nand assorted machines and construction tools for cutting\nholes through the tank wall to install view ports, airlocks, and other apertures.\nOther equipment to be launched to the LEO facility\nincludes the pelletizer for chewing up external tanks into\nMDRE propellant; the electrolysis and liquefication\nsystems for making liquid oxygen and hydrogen for\nchemical propellants; consumables for the crew for the\nfirst year; and a set of trusses and booms to provide\ntemporary tiedown storage for Shuttle cargo items and\nexternal tanks and to serve as a basic construction yoke.\nIn addition, the first MDRE must be brought to LEO\nbefore accumulation of lunar cargos can begin in earnest.\nTable 4 summarizes the estimated mass budget\nrequired in LEO to attain the zeroth milestone. The\ntotal mass of 464 tons can be accommodated in 16 full\nShuttle payloads. Six liqUid hydrogen tanks and one\ncomplete external tank set must be reserved for constructing the LEO station. The mass required to complete the interior refurbishing of tanks for expansion to\n48 persons is also shown in table 4, requiring 4.8 additional Shuttle payloads, but no additional external\ntanks.\nThe schedule to attain the zeroth and first milestones\nis as follows:\n1. First Shuttle launch for this enterprise occurs\nearly in January 1985.\n2. Shuttle launch No. 16 completes delivery of equipment and supplies for the LEO station and for the first\nMDRE late in March 1985.\n3. Shuttle launch No. 106 completes delivery to LEO\nof supplies and equipment to be delivered to lunar orbit,\nwith departure of the third MDRE flight to lunar orbit\nin October 1986. (One Shuttle flight in January 1986\nhas been used to resupply consumables for the LEO\nstation.)\n4. The third MDRE flight to lunar orbit arrives there\nearly in March 1987, simultaneously with an OTV flight\ncarrying the initial lunar crew.\n5. The lunar base begins routine launch of materials\ninto space at the rate of 30,000 metric tons/yr shortly\n\n67\n\nTABLE 4.- MASS BUDGET FOR LOW\nEARTH ORBIT STATION\nComponent\nInitial station (24 persons)\nHabitat refurbishing\nEnergy system\nElectrolysis and\nliquefication systems\nPelletizer\nSpace caisson\nCargo tiedown,\nconstruction yoke\nSpare parts\nConsumables (one year supply\nat 3 kg/person/day)\nGeneral contingency\nMass driver reaction\nengine (ref. 12)\nTotal payload for Shuttle\nExpansion to 48 persons\nHabitat refurbishing\nEnergy system\nConsumables (one\nyear supply for 24)\nTotal payload for Shuttle\n\nMass budget,\nmetric tons\n\n142\n16\n25\n25\n25\n10\n5\n27\n15\n174\n464\n\n100\n11\n27\n138\n\nafter sunrise at the lunar base on 1 June 1987, completing the first milestone.\nDeparture of the third MDRE flight from the LEO\nstation does not, of course, imply shutdown of LEO\noperations. Accumulation of supplies and equipment for\nexpansion of the lunar base, for assembly of the initial\nSMF, and for expansion of the MDRE fleet begin in\nmid-November 1986, after nearly five Shuttle payloads\nhave been used to expand the LEO station.\nWe suggested above that the MDRE would remain at\nthe catcher for four lunar days after launch of lunar\nmaterials begins in June 1987 to permit accumulation of\na reasonable cargo of lunar materials for delivery to the\nSMF. Departure to the SMF would then occur on\n11 October 1987, with arrival at the SMF site (discussed\nbelow) in February 1988. The waiting period is arbitrary\nsince no optimization studies have been made. A shorter\nwaiting period would permit earlier SMF operation with\n\n68\n\na smaller supply of raw materials; a longer period would\npostpone initial SMF operation still further by prolonging the time enroute for the MDRE because of its\nincreased payload. The present choice seems reasonable\nbut nonetheless arbitrary.\nIf the SMF is to begin operation in February 1988,\nthe last cargo of equipment and supplies for the initial\nSMF must depart LEO aboard an MDRE in October\n1987. Thus everything necessary for the initial SMF\nmust be delivered to LEO and assembled in about\n11 months (mid-November 1986 to October 1987), with\nseveral Shuttle flights reserved for resupply of consumabIes for LEO, for delivery of the first lunar crew in an\nOTV passenger module, and for additional MDRE\'s. As\nshown below, some 1980 metric tons of payload must\nbe delivered to LEO for the initial SMF alone, equivalent\nto more than 14 months of Shuttle launch operations. It\nis thus appropriate to upgrade the surface-to-LEO transportation system at this stage of operations.\nA relatively inexpensive upgrading of the Shuttle\nsystem can be achieved with a 5-year development program. Some of the basic characteristics of such a Shuttlederived heavy lift vehicle (SD/HLV) are shown in\ntable 5, along with similar data for the Shuttle itself and\nfor a more advanced reusable single-stage-to-orbit\n(SSTO) launch vehicle. Assuming development of the\nSD/HLV begins between 1980 and 1982 as part of the\ntotal R&D effort for the space manufacturing enterprise,\nit is reasonable to expect that a fleet of four SD/HLV\'s\ncould be operational beginning in January 1987, with\n801aunches/yr in parallel with 60 Shuttle flights per\nyear. With this combination of launch vehicles, the mass\ndelivered annually to LEO would increase from 1,740 to\n10,780 tons. This sixfold increase would not, however,\nrequire a sixfold expansion of the LEO crew, for two\nreasons: first, some of the assembly work for the SMF\ncan be postponed until the SMF crew arrives at the SMF\nsite; second, the larger payload capacity of the SD/HLV\nwill reduce the assembly work required per ton of payloads delivered to LEO. Should further study show that\na crew of 48 is insufficient, the LEO station we have\nprovided can accommodate a total of 84 workers, with\nsome adjustments required in payload scheduling to\nbring up more furnishings and more consumables per\nyear.\nWith this expansion in Earth launch capabilities, the\nnumber of expendable Shuttle external tanks also\nincreases from 60 tanks/yr to 140 tanks, providing propellants for delivery of somewhat more than 2.4 times as\nmuch mass per year to high orbit for reasons that will\nemerge below. The MDRE fleet thus must be expanded\n\nTABLE 5.- EARTH-TO-ORBIT VEHICLES\nSpace Shuttle\nConfiguration: airplanelike Shuttle orbiter\ncontains main engines.

The first priority, however,\nis to provide the initial SMF.\n\nDEPLOYMENT OF INITIAL SPACE\nMANUFACTURING FACILITY\nAlthough the objective of the entire space manufacturing enterprise is to produce solar power satellites\nfrom non terrestrial materials, as yet no one has developed a credible SPS design optimized for non terrestrial\nmaterials. In this sense, the end product of the SMF is\npoorly defined so that the designs of the chemical processing plant and of the fabrication plant are subject to\nmajor uncertainties. As a point of departure for logistical\nplanning purposes, we have adopted a conceptual design\nfor the SMF factory developed during the 1976 NASA\nAmes/OAST Summer study on space manufacturing\n(refs. 7,8).\nIn that design, it was assumed that the lunar materials\narriving at the SMF would be completely unselected\n(except for choices between mare and highland soils).\nPresent thinking suggests that it would be much more\nefficient to perform extensive beneficiation operations\non the lunar surface before launch by the mass driver\n(ref. 17). The initial lunar operations would not include\nbeneficiation; equipment for beneficiation would be\nadded during expansion of the lunar base to full capacity\n(as discussed below).\nRaw materials arriving at the SMF would thus consist\nof separate cargos of (I) unselected (but sieved) lunar\nmaterials for radiation shielding or for MDRE refueling,\n(2) plagioclase concentrates from lunar highland soils,\nand (3) ilmenite concentrates from mare soils (ref. 17).\nThe chemical processing plant required to extract\noxygen, silicon, glass, iron, aluminum, and titanium\nfrom these concentrates is far simpler than that\ndescribed in references 7 and 8; nonetheless, for conservatism, we have used the mass estimates given there. For\na processing plant with an annual capacity of\n600,000 metric tons, the chemical processing plant\ntotals 2770 tons; the energy system (photovoltaic arrays\nand radiators), 3852 tons; and the fabrication plant,\n5000 to 6800 tons. The entire factory then totals\n11,600 to 13,400 tons, exclusive of radiation shielding.\nThe first lunar materials delivered to the SMF are\nunselected soil. Approximately 10,000 tons of this material are needed for radiation shielding of the initial\nhabitat, and an additional 4500 tons are required for\nreaction mass for the MDRE fleet to expand the lunar\n\n69\n\nbase and the SMF during the year following initial operation of the SMF. The initial factory includes equipment\nto extract oxygen from the unselected lunar soil by\nreduction with hydrogen, with water vapor collected in a\ncold trap. The hydrogen is recovered by electrolysis, and\nthe oxygen can be used either for life support or liquetied for use in the OTV and the LTV. The factory also\nincludes equipment to sinter the lunar soil into several\nshapes of large slabs for radiation shielding. Most of the\nfactory mass is taken up by chemical processing equipment and fabrication machinery for the production of\nstructural sheets, plates, and beams and of glass to\npermit rapid expansion of the SMF factory and habitat\nas soon as concentrated ores begin to arrive. (This equipment may possibly be used, at much lower efficiencies,\nto extract metals and glass from the unselected soil\nprovided in the early deliveries.)\nTo bootstrap the entire enterprise from a minimum\ninitial mass, as much as possible of the final factory and\nhabitat masses should themselves be manufactured at the\nSMF. Portions of the pressure hulls, photovoltaic arrays,\nradiators, and massive foundry components could be\nfabricated readily with the same equipment used to\nbuild the SPS\'s. As a preliminary (and highly uncertain)\nworking estimate, we have assumed that 9 percent of the\nmass of any finished products manufactured by the SMF\nmust be imported from Earth in the form of complicated components or of raw materials to be used, for\nexample, in alloying structural materials, doping semiconductors, or as special optical coatings (refs. 7,8 estimate about 9 percent imports for the manufacture of\nSPS\'s). Initially, the factory will have only a limited\ncapacity to contribute to its own expansion; as the\nfactory approaches full size over a 3-year period, however, we assume it will approach a 91-percent contribution toward the mass required to complete the SMF\nfactory and habitat. We thus estimate that an additional\n4670 tons of factory components must be imported\nfrom Earth over the 3-year growth period, with\n6900 tons provided by the factory itself from lunar\nmaterials. Similar considerations apply to habitat interior furnishings and airlocks. Shuttle external tanks (as\nshown below) continue to be available for use as pressure hulls until the end of 1990, but detailed trade-offs\nremain to be made to determine whether the optimum\nuse of these tanks is as reaction mass for the MDRE fleet\nor as pressure hulls at the SMF.\nThe estimated masses for the initial SMF and for its\nexpansion over the subsequent 3 years to reach full\ncapacity (600,000 metric tons/hr) are shown in table 6.\nAn initial crew of 150, including administrative, mainte-\n\n70\n\nTABLE 6.- MASS BUDGET FOR THE SPACE\nMANUF ACTURING FACILITY\nComponent\n\nMass budget,\nmetric tons\n\nInitial SMF (30,000 tons/year)\nHabitat (14 LH2 tanks,\npressurized and furnished for\ncrew of 150, expandable to\n\n252)\nEnergy system for habitat\nStructural cable to support\nradiation shielding\nConsumables (1 year supply\nfor 150)\nPropellant depot\nPropellants\nChemical processing plant\n(60,000 tons/year)\nFabrication plant\n(60,000 tons/year)\nEnergy system for factory\nSpare parts\nGeneral contingency\n\n583\n40\n140\n165\n38\n\n294\n\n230\n250\n415\n\n20\n50\n\nTotal MDRE payload\nShuttle external tanks\n\n2225\n-236.5\n\nShuttle or SD/HLV payload\n\n1988.5\n\nExpansion to full capacity\n(600,000 tons/year)\nInterior furnishings for\n154 more LH2 tanks (or\nequivalent)\nEnvironmental control/life\nsupport system (EC/LSS)\nunits; airlock pumps and\nseals\nChemical processing plant\nequipment\nFabrication plant equipment\nMiscellaneous components and\nspecial materials\nShuttle or SD/HLV payload\n\n1650\n\n1320\n860\n3000\n810\n7640\n\nnance, galley, and medical personnel, should be sufficient, with productivity of 100-110 kg/hr/person\nrequired to process 30,000 tons/yr. A modular habitat\n\ndesign using 14 liquid hydrogen tanks from the Shuttle\nexternal tank sets was assumed, with maximum commonality of design with the habitats at LEO and at the\ncatcher. (See the discussion of habitat design below.)\nSuch a configuration readily accommodates 150 persons\ninitially. Completion of interior refurbishing work will\nallow expansion to 234 to 252 persons, depending on\nassumptions about the amount of community space\nrequired and about sharing of private quarters.\nBased on a consideration of the energy and reaction\nmass needed to transport large masses of lunar soil from\nthe catcher to the SMF and to subsequently transport\nsolar power satellites from the SMF to geosynchronous\norbit, a previous study identified the 2:1 resonance orbit\nas a highly desirable site for the SMF (ref. 13). Additional factors, however, must also be included in optimizing the -SMF site, especially in the early stages of a\nspace manufacturing enterprise. Since the MDRE is to be\nused to deliver cargos from LEO to the initial SMF site,\nits operating characteristics must be taken into account.\nA continuous, low-thrust propulsion system (such as the\nMDRE) is ill-suited for orbital transfers between a circular orbit such as the LEO station and a highly eccentric\norbit such as the 2: 1 resonance orbit. Both time enroute\nand total propellant mass for the MDRE will be less for a\ncircular orbit SMF site. Optimization of the SMF site\n(both in the initiai stages of the space manufacturing\nenterprise and in a late, mature stage) will also depend\nstrongly on the ratio of mass that must be imported\nfrom Earth to the mass brought from the Moon to\nproduce SPS\'s, and of these two masses to the mass of\nthe SPS which must be moved to geosynchronous orbit.\nThese factors were not considered in the earlier\noptimiza tion.\nGeosynchronous orbit might seem a natural choice\nfor an SMF; unfortunately, the outer portions of the\nVan Allen radiation belts are sufficiently intense at geosynchronous distance to create serious problems. Without performing the careful trade-off needed to optimize\nthe system, we have somewhat arbitrarily selected a\n2-day circular orbit at 10.6 Earth radii (67,500 km) for\nthe initial SMF site. Should the 2: 1 resonance orbit or\nsome other highly eccentric orbit prove to be the optimum site for the SMF in a mature system, the entire\nSMF can be relocated at leisure, using MDRE "tugs,"\nperhaps 5 or 10 years after initial operation of the SMF.\nOn its way to lunar orbit, the MDRE reaches 2-day\ncircular orbit about 4 months after departure from LEO;\non the return voyage, it passes through this orbit about\n3 weeks before arrival at LEO. An identical MDRE could\nthus depart from LEO with increased payload and\n\ndecreased reaction mass, completing a round trip to the\nSMF in a travel time about 5 weeks shorter than the\n6 months required for the round trip to lunar orbit. The\npropellant requirements for a round trip to lunar orbit\nto deliver 850 tons amount to 30 external tanks\nexpended more or less uniformly over the duration of\nthe flight. If the total mass at departure from LEO is the\nsame for both missions, the MDRE flight to the SMF site\ncan deliver 1025 tons while expending less than\n25 external tanks as reaction mass. Once the MDRE can\nrefuel at SMF (less than 175 tons of lunar materials will\nsuffice to return the unloaded MDRE to LEO),\n1200 tons can be delivered to the SMF using fewer than\n20 external tanks in the same round-trip time of slightly\nless than 5 months.\nRefueling at the SMF can also increase the effective\ncapacity of the MDRE in transporting cargos to lunar\norbit, requiring fewer than 20 external tanks at LEO and\n175 tons of lunar materials at the SMF of the outbound\nvoyage to deliver 1200 tons at the expense of about\n1 week more for the outbound flight. Propellants for the\nreturn trip from the catcher to the SMF would, again, be\nprovided from the cargo of lunar materials.\nFor MDRE flights arriving at the SMF site after\nFebruary 1988, the above improved performance figures\nwere used. In addition, we have estimated that an MDRE\ncan deliver to LEO a cargo of lunar materials for a\nreaction mass equivalent to about 30 Shuttle external\ntanks (1050 tons) in 4 months, expending 850 tons\nenroute. This procedure is a somewhat inefficient way to\nsupplement the supply of external tanks but is occasionally necessary to avoid excessive bottlenecks in orbital\ntransfer. Detailed study is required to evaluate whether\nit would be more effective to reoptimize the MDRE for\nthe SD/HLV\'s higher ratio of payload mass to external\ntank mass.\n\nLUNAR BASE EXPANSION\nThe initial lunar base installation was limited in its\nproductive capacity to 1/20 the capacity of the mass\ndriver, both by the limited power available for the mass\ndriver and by the limited mining equipment. Expansion\nto full capacity (600,000 metric tons launched per year)\nhas been examined in detail by Williams et al. (ref. 17),\nwho estimate that a permanent crew of about 48 will be\nsufficient to mine, process, and launch lunar materials at\nfull capacity. The initial habitat (two liqUid hydrogen\ntanks from the Shuttle external tank sets) must be\nreplicated. Besides the equipment required for the\n\n71\n\nexpanded mining and beneficiation operations, addi\xc2\xb7\ntional photovoltaic arrays must be provided to power\nthe mass driver and the mining and beneficiation equip\xc2\xb7\nment. We have added two more items to the list: an\noxygen extraction plant to replace oxygen lost from the\nhabitats by leakage, and a small factory to spin fiberglass\nsacks for the lunar soil to be launched by the mass\ndriver. The total mass requirements are summarized in\ntable 7.\nWhile most of the mining and beneficiation equip\xc2\xb7\nment is very specialized and has thus been assumed to be\nimported from Earth, more than half the total mass is\nphotovoltaic arrays. As the entire space manufacturing\nenterprise expands, production of photovoltaic cells at\nthe SMF will grow. We have assumed that about\n1225 metric tons (of the 1805 tons total required) can\nbe provided by the SMF, reducing the net payload to be\ntransported to LEO by the Shuttle or the SD/HLV.\nGiving credit for the liquid hydrogen tanks used to\nconstruct the additional habitat facilities, we find that\nthe total equipment to be launched to LEO amounts to\n2271 tons. Chemical propellants and propellant storage\ndepots were not included in this figure, but appear\nelsewhere.\nTABLE 7.- MASS BUDGET FOR LUNAR\nBASE EXPANSION\nComponent\nHabitat (two LH2 tanks, pressurized\nand furnished for crew of 24)\n8 mining trucks\n1 bucket\xc2\xb7wheel extractor\n5 ore beneficiation modules\n2 conveyor belt systems\nMaintenance sheds\nOxygen extraction plant\nFiberglass sack factory\nGeneral contingency and spare parts\nPhotovoltaic arrays\nTotal\nPhotovoltaic arrays manufac\xc2\xb7\ntured at the SMF\nTwo liquid hydrogen tanks\nNet Shuttle or SD/HLV\npayloads\n\n72\n\nMass budget,\nmetric tons\n\n200\n154\n460\n385\n\n96\n100\n125\n125\n\n75\n1805\n3525\n-1225\n-29\n\n2271\n\nWe have not analyzed in detail the relative merits of\nusing lunar oxygen in the lunar transfer vehicles (LTV\'s)\nversus continuing to provide all propellants for LTV\noperations at lunar orbit. Tanking up with hydrogen at\nthe lunar orbit propellant depot and tanking up with\noxygen at the lunar surface would provide a major\nreduction in the total propellant mass required to be\ndelivered to lunar orbit by the MDRE, with hydrogen\ncoming from Earth and oxygen from the SMF beginning\nin 1990. On the other hand, the payload deliverable by\nthe LTV in this mode of operation would be reduced, so\nthat more LTV flights would be required. We have\nconservatively assumed that all propellants continue to\nbe provided in lunar orbit.\nFor the first year of lunar operations, when a crew of\n24 was used to establish the main and downrange sta\xc2\xb7\ntions, a total of 32 tons of consumables was provided\n(25 at the main base; 7 at the downrange station which\nwould be occupied by no more than 12 during the lunar\nday only). With expansion of the lunar base to 48 people\nearly in 1988, the consumables are increased to\n60 tons/yr until oxygen is supplied at the lunar surface,\ncutting the consumables budget in half. Similarly, provi\xc2\xb7\nsions for the catcher habitat initially include 7 tons for\nthe first year of operations. After operations at the\ncatcher have become more routine,S tons/yr should suf\xc2\xb7\nfice, with a further reduction to 3 tons/yr when oxygen\nbecomes available at the SMF.\nWe have assumed that the lunar crews have a 1\xc2\xb7year\ntour of duty in space (i.e., 1 year from launch to LEO\nuntil reentry into the Earth\'s atmosphere). If the lunar\nbase expansion to a crew of 48 is staggered 6 months\nfrom the date of rotation of the first 24, the main lunar\nbase need never be unoccupied. A total of three OTV\'s\n(with passenger modules large enough for 24 to 30 per\xc2\xb7\nsons) is sufficient to provide emergency evacuation capa\xc2\xb7\nbility for the entire lunar crew with one of these OTV\'s\nparked in LEO for emergency backup. The OTV fleet\nused to transport crews to and from the SMF provides\nadditional backup. Thus two OTV round trips must be\nprovided for each year, with contingency propellants at\nLEO and at lunar orbit for two more flights per year.\nThese propellant requirements, together with the propel\xc2\xb7\nlants required for soft\xc2\xb7landing supplies, equipment, and\npersonnel on the lunar surface and the propellants\nneeded for monthly trips with the small LTV to the\ncatcher, are given in table 8.\nFor the first chemical propellant storage depots, we\nminimized the time and labor of converting Shuttle\nexternal tanks by keeping the basic external tank struc\xc2\xb7\nture intact. Once oxygen and hydrogen are supplied\n\nTABLE 8.- PROPELLANT REQUIREMENTS FOR LUNAR OPERATIONSa\nYear of\ndelivery\nto\nLEO\n\nPropellants\nloaded\nonOTV\nat LEO\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n\n60.5\n269.5\n220\n220\n32\n32\n32\n\nPropellants\nloaded\nonOTV\nat LLO\n\nPropellants\nfor\nlarge\nLTV\n\n165\n220\n220\n32\n32\n32\n32\n\n896\n896\n952\n136\n33\n33\n33\n\nPropellants\nfor\nsmall\nLTV\n186\n186\n186\n27\n27\n27\n27\n\nTotal Earthsupplied\npropellants\nat LLO\n1247\n1302\n1358\n195\n92\n92\n92\n\nTotal SMFsupplied\npropellants\nat LLO\n\n-----\n\n----1170\n552\n552\n\naIn metric tons.\n\nfrom different sources (LEO for hydrogen from Earth,\nSMF for oxygen from lunar soil), it is more practical to\nseparate the oxygen and hydrogen tanks and to discard\nthe intertank section, reducing the mass of each complete depot by about 8 tons.\nThe expansion of the lunar base to full capacity\nwould be completed by rnid-1990, with a total of\n4530 metric tons of equipment soft-landed at the two\nsurface stations. Continuation of the lunar surface operations at this level requires soft-landing 30 tons of consumables per year, 14.4 tons of crew and baggage, plus\nan ample allowance of replacement parts and supplies.\nWe have arbitrarily allotted 195.6 metric tons/yr for this\npurpose (about 4 percent of the total installed mass), so\nthat three trips per year by the large LTV will suffice.\nThe mass budget we have provided above will provide\nthe lunar base with the capability of launching\n600,000 metric tons/yr into space with daytime operations only. Some consideration should be given to ways\nof extending lunar base operations through the lunar\nnight. The possibility of several large reflector satellites\nplaced in high-inclination orbits around the Moon to\nprovide full daylight illumination for the lunar base\nshould be examined. Such satellites could be manufactured at the SMF and placed in lunar orbit with minimal\nconsumption of propellants, significantly reducing the\ntotal mass of the energy systems which must be softlanded on the lunar surface, and nearly doubling the\nlaunch capacity of the lunar base (ref. 18).\n\nSMF EXPANSION AND OPERATIONS\nThe final milestone for the space manufacturing\nenterprise considered here is to produce 2.4 solar power\nsatellites per year, each with a capacity of 10 GW. Previous studies of Earth-launched solar power satellites\nestimate that 750 to 800 man-years of assembly work\nmust be done in orbit for each such satellite (H. P. Davis,\nNASA, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, private\ncommunication, 1977). In the case of the space manufacturing system considered here, assembly work should\nbe comparable, but additional labor must be provided\nfor chemical processing and for fabricating basic structural components and active elements (such as photovoltaic cells or thermal-cycle radiators). Chemical processing and basic foundry and milling operations are\ngenerally much more automated (when measured in tons\nproduced per worker per year) than are assembly operations in terrestrial industries. We have thus assumed that\na total of 1250 man-years will be needed at the SMF to\nproduce each SPS. The target of 2.4 SPS\'s per year thus\nrequires an SMF crew of 3000.\nWe have assumed that the SMF crew is initially\nexchanged after a I-year tour of duty, as were the LEO\nstation crew and the lunar base crew. Once the total\ncrew at the SMF reaches 1000, however, we have\nassumed that the tour of duty can be extended to\n2 years because of the larger physical size of the SMF\nand because the larger size of the community affords\nmore opportunity for each person to establish satisfactory social interactions. The schedule of crew buildup\n\n73\n\nand exchange and the numbers of OTV\'s and the masses\nof propellants required at LEO and at SMF for personnel\ntransportation between LEO and the SMF, are shown in\ntable 9. A number of contingency flights have also been\nbudgeted, as well as a number of spare vehicles at LEO.\nAs a minimum, we have ensured that sufficient propel\xc2\xb7\nlants and vehicles are available at the SMF at all times to\nevacuate to LEO all SMF personnel (up to 252) living in\none cluster of 14 converted liquid hydrogen tanks.\n\nLIFE-SUPPORT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS\nA space habitat must provide equipment for extracting potable water from human wastes and washing\nwater; for maintaining atmospheric temperature, humidity, and composition within an acceptable range; and for\nstoring or disposing of waste materials. A modular design\nfor an environmental control and life-support system\n(EC/LSS) was adopted for use in all space habitats in\nthis space manufacturing system. Carbon dioxide is concentrated by a molecular sieve and then reduced to\ncarbon ash and free oxygen by the Sabatier process.\nEach EC/LSS unit, with a mass of 10.4 metric tons,\nsupports 12 people with 100-percent redundancy, and\nfits in a cylindrical pod (3 m in diameter, 2.5 m long)\nlarge enough to provide interior access for repairs and\nmaintenance (E. H. Bock, General Dynamics, Convair\nDivision, San Diego, CA, private communication regarding a design adapted from ref. 19). With efficient oxygen\nrecovery, a space station using such a system would\nrequire about 1.5 kg/person resupply per day (including\nfood as well as water, oxygen, and nitrogen losses\nthrough leaks and during EVA). Without oxygen recovery, such a system would require 2.05 kg/person/day.\nWe have assumed 3.0 kg/person/day for consumables\nimported from Earth until lunar oxygen becomes freely\navailable in 1990, when the consumables resupply is\nreduced to 1.5 kg/person/day. All waste materials are\nstockpiled for later use in agriculture.\nRadiation protection is an important issue in habitat\ndesign. For the LEO station (below the Van Allen belts),\nwe have provided no shielding additional to that\nafforded by the walls and furnishings of the converted\nShuttle tanks. The lunar habitats can be shielded readily\nby burying them under several meters of lunar soil. The\nhabitat at the catcher can be shielded several years after\ninitial operation against cosmic rays and solar flares, but\nthe expense of providing shielding very early would be\ndifficult to justify because of the very limited times\nduring which it will be occupied by small crews.\n\n74\n\nFor the SMF, on the other hand, cosmic-ray shielding\nmust be provided early. This can be done using the\nunselected lunar soils provided in the first few deliveries\nfrom the catcher during the first 6 months of occupancy. Solar flares, however, pose a serious threat to the\nSMF crew during this early period. Stowing the consumabies for the first year around the walls and between\nflooring in the galley and mess hall areas of the communal tanks can provide an adequate shelter for solar\nstorms lasting several days, should they occur before the\nentire habitat is shielded properly.\nEstimates of power requirements per person in space\nstations have been extremely variable. In Skylab, electrical power for life support, environmental control, cooking, refrigeration, and lighting was 2.87 kW/person (average power). Most of the astronauts who flew Sky lab\ncomplained that lighting was inadequate (ref. 20).\nAllowing for the limited EVA of the Sky lab missions in\ncomparison with the space manufacturing enterprise\nconsidered here, we have allowed 9 kW/person (average\npower) throughout the system, except that the main\nlunar base provides only 8 kW/person during the lunar\nnight when little EVA is expected, and the downrange\nstation on the lunar surface provides only 3 kW/person\nduring the lunar night for emergencies, since it is\nexpected to be occupied only during the lunar day.\nPhoto voltaic arrays have been sized accordingly, assuming peak power of 200 W/m 2 under normal incidence of\nfull sunlight and a mass of 1.61 kg/m2. Radiator systems\nto remove heat dissipated by use of electrical power and\nfrom human metabolism were assumed to require\n170 kg/person with a radiator area of 68 m 2/person.\nEnergy storage is provided by flywheels at the lunar\nsurface habitats and at the LEO station, with an energy\nstorage density of 870 W-hr/kg, and a highly conservative 70-percent overall efficiency. Research and development costs for the photovoltaic arrays, radiators, and\nflywheels can be minimized by modular designs sized for\na few persons, just as the EC/LSS pods were sized for\n12 persons, providing maximum commonality throughout the system.\nHABITAT DESIGN\nFor the space manufacturing system described here,\nhabitats are required in four different sets of environments and operational conditions:\n1. LEO station: permanent occupation, minimal\nradiation protection needed, prompt return to Earth\npossible by means of the Shuttle, small crew, frequent\nvisitors\n\nTABLE 9.- CHEMICAL OTV LOGISTICS FOR SMF PERSONNEL TRANSPORTATION\n\nDate\n\nCrew\nat SMF\n\n1987.0\n\nNo_ of\nflights\noutbound\n(fullf\n\n0\n\nNo_ of\nOTV\'sin\nactive\nuse\n\nNo. of\n\nTotal\nspare\ninbound\nOTY\'s\npassengers\nat LEO\n\nNo. of\nflights\ninbound\n(fullf\n\nNo. of\nflights\ninbound\n(empty)b\n\n0\n\n1988.0\n\nCrew\nexchange\n\nCrew\n\nincrease\n\nTotal\noutbound\npassengers\n\nEarthsupplied\npropellants\nloaded\nat LEO\n(metric tons)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n300\n1989.0\n\n--0\n\n300\n\n10+3\n\n300\n\n--91 H,\n5460,\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n10\n\n3\n\n0\n\n0+13\n\n0\n\nEarthsupplied\npropellants\nloaded\nat SMF\n(metric tons)\n\n--91 H,\n5460,\n\nEarthsupplied\npropellants\ndelivered\nto LEO\nfor later\nuse at LEO\n(metric tons)\n\nEarthsupplied\npropellants\ndelivered\nto LEO\nfor later\nuse at SMF\n(metric tons)\n\nSMF-supplied\noxygen\ndelivered to\nLEO for later\nuse at LEO\n(metric tons)\n\n319\n\n441\n\n---\n\n700\n\n852\n\n---\n\n300\n\n840\n\n28+5\n\n231 H,\n13860,\n\n20\n\n5\n\n300\n\n10+5\n\n8\n\n142.7 H,\n856.30,\n\n1500\n\n840\n\n2340\n\n78+5\n\n581 H,\n\n50\n\n5\n\n840\n\n28+5\n\n20\n\n325.2 H,\n\n495\n\n417.6\n\n4286\n\n684\n\n1670\n\n2354\n\n79+5\n\n588 H,\n\n51\n\n5\n\n1670\n\n56+5\n\n22\n\n530.6 H,\n\n489\n\n459\n\n3528\n\n0\n\n1512\n\n1512\n\n51+5\n\n392 H,\n\n51\n\n5\n\n1512\n\n51+5\n\n0\n\n392 H,\n\n392\n\n392\n\n2352\n\n0\n\n1512\n\n1512\n\n51+5\n\n392 H,\n\n51\n\n5\n\n1512\n\n51+5\n\n0\n\n392 H,\n\n392\n\n392\n\n2352\n\n----\n\n. ___ - - . - .

Unused propellants provide additional launch space to LEO in the following year, reducing the numbers shown in the last two columns year\nby year.\n\nb To the extent that outbound flight requirements exceed inbound flights plus increases in the OTV fleet at LEO, some empty flights must be made from the SMF back to LEO, consuming 33 tons of propellants per flight.\n\n-....I\n\nVI\n\n2. SMF: permanent occupation, full radiation shielding required early, rapid return to LEO possible (but\nexpensive) by means of OTV, large crew, no visitors\n3. Catcher: infrequently occupied for short periods\nby very small crews, 40 hr travel time to LLO and lunar\nsurface\n4. Lunar surface: permanent occupation at main\nbase, intermittent long occupations of downrange base,\nsmall crews, prolonged isolation remote from Earth,\n1/6 normal gravity, early protection required against\nradiation and thermal extremes\nBecause the Shuttle external propellant tank is an\nexisting piece of hardware that can be delivered into\norbit at minimal cost and because it was designed to\nsustain very heavy loads under launch accelerations, we\nhave based all our habitat designs on the use of the\nliquid hydrogen tank as the basic structural frame and\npressure vessel. This approach also permits a high degree\nof commonality throughout the system and seems to\nprovide a reasonable compromise between the safety\nfeatures of small modular habitats in the early stages of\ngrowth and the economies of scale of large monolithic\nstructures. The extensive structural ribbing along the\ntank walls provides easy attachment of internal partitions and structures, permitting simple installation of the\nhabitat interiors. (Some years ago, a proposal to use\nspent fuel tanks from Saturn rockets for space station\nshells was considered. The cryogenic insulation for those\ntanks, however, was on the inside of the tanks, and\noutgassing of hydrogen from the insulation for prolonged periods seemed to be a sufficiently severe problem that the proposal was rejected. For the Shuttle\ntanks, there is no such problem since the insulation is on\nthe outside.)\nThe liquid hydrogen tank is 31 m long and 8.5 m in\ndiameter (96 by 27.5 ft). For the orbital habitats, we\nhave adopted a "condominium tower" configuration,\ndividing each tank into 10 levels of circular floor plan,\nwith 2.6 m (8 ft) ceiling heights, leaving more than\n0.5 m of subflooring space for utilities and storage.\n(Reducing the subtloor storage space to 0.2 m would\nallow 11 levels per tank with the same ceiling height.) A\ncentral shaft (l.8 m in diameter) runs the entire length\nof each tank, containing a dumbwaiter-like continuous\nbelt elevator and ladders for access to all levels.\nFor the LEO station and the SMF habitat, several\nresidential tanks would be clustered around a communal\ntank. The lowest level (in the bottom hemispherical\ndome of the tank) of each tank would be used for\nstorage and for maintenance equipment. In the residential tanks, seven of the levels would be divided into three\n\n76\n\nsegments surrounding the elevator shaft to provide three\nstudio apartments per level. Each apartment would have\n17.5 m 2 (188.5 ft 2 ) of floor space, sufficient for one or\ntwo persons. One level (in the middle of the tank) would\nprovide toilet, bath, and laundry facilities, while the top\nlevel (in the upper hemispherical dome) would be used\nas a leisure and social area (game room, observation\ndeck).\nIn the communal tanks, the lowest level would be\nused for storage and maintenance. The next three levels\nup would provide recreational facilities (gymnasium,\ngames, library, music room). A pantry and a galley\nwould follow on the next two levels, with the following\nthree levels used for dining rooms. (The dining rooms\nwould double as assembly halls and movie theaters as\nwell.) The topmost level would be used for EVA preparation, providing lockers for storage of EVA suits and\nfacilities for recharging oxygen tanks and repairing EVA\nsuits.\nThe top level and one lower level of each residential\ntank would be connected to the corresponding levels of\nthe communal tank and of each adjacent residential\ntank. When fully occupied, each residential tank (21 persons) requires two EC/LSS pods (12 persons each).\nThese can be nestled between adjacent hydrogen tanks,\nwith short tunnels connecting each pod to both hydrogen tanks to provide access to the EC/LSS equipment\nfor maintenance as well as to provide alternative emergency passageways between tanks. All passageways\nwould be equipped with airtight hatches to permit isolation of any tank.\nTwo identical clusters of residential tanks and a communal tank can then be assembled with a 140-m-long\ntunnel between them to form a dumbbell-like configuration. Rotation at 3 rpm then provides Earth-normal gravity at the bottom level of each tank and 0.7 g at the top\nlevel. The tunnel is stress-free, the hydrogen tanks being\nsupported from the docking hub at the middle of the\nconnecting tunnel by a set of cables. Each tank has an\nemergency airlock at the top level, with routine entry\ninto the habitat through two airlocks in the hub. One of\nthe dining room levels (of the six provided in the two\ncommunal tanks) would be used instead for a medical\nclinic/emergency operating room.\nThe Shuttle tank sets, designed to carry 700 metric\ntons under launch accelerations exceeding 2 g, are structurally capable of supporting the loads contemplated\nhere with a very large safety factor. The internal loads\nwould be borne by the tank ribbing and by three or\nmore tie bars running the length of the elevator shaft\nwhich transmit their load to the cables suspending the\n\n--------------\n\nentire tank from the hub. With a rotation rate of 3 rpm,\ncrew selection for adaptability to rotation would be\nessential but would not pose a serious problem for most\npeople (ref. 21).\n\nFor the catcher habitat, only one tank need be provided, using a mixture of levels from residential and\ncommunal tanks. A crew of 12 would be amply accommodated by four apartment levels; one toilet and laundry level; one pantry/galley/dining level; one recreation\nlevel; one level for workshops used to maintain and\nrepair the catcher; one storage level; and one level for\nEVA preparation. This single tank does not provide\npseudogravity, so no elevator is installed in the central\nshaft, crew members using ladders instead. The consistent vertical orientation throughout the 10 levels,\nrequired for the rotating habitats at LEO and at the\nSMF, would ease adaptation to the weightlessness of the\ncatcher habitat (ref. 20). The habitat tank would be\nplaced directly behind the catcher itself to protect the\nhabitat from stray projectiles of lunar materials.\n\nFor the LEO station, two residential tanks and one\ncommunal tank would be placed at each end of the\ndumbbell, providing facilities for as many as 84 persons.\nFor the SMF habitat, each end of the dumbbell would\nconsist of six residential tanks encircling a communal\ntank. The top level of the communal tank provides\naccess to both the elevator system within that tank and a\nsecond elevator system running up to the hub. Because\nthe SMF has a lower ratio of communal space to population than does the LEO station, some reallocation of\nspace different from that described above may be necessary. Several levels among the six residential tanks could\nbe changed from apartment levels into communal facilities. The total occupancy might be reduced from 252 to\nas low as 234 or the reduction in space could be compensated by some doubling up of crew members. (Alternatively, the II-level design could be adopted from the\nstart, increasing the total mass somewhat.) Spinning up\nthe SMF habitat dumbbell to 3 rpm requires only\n1 metric ton of propellant, a mass sufficiently small to\nbe omitted from the mass budgets shown in the tables.\n(Figure 1 shows a design for the SMF habitat.)\n\nFurniture and personal belongings for a small one- or\ntwo-person apartment in the United States may total\n1000 to 3000lb (including refrigerator, carpets, and\ndrapes). Instead of attempting to give a detailed breakdown of masses for furniture, toilets, shower stalls, laundry equipment, and galley equipment, we have allowed\n1000 kg (2200 lb) of furniture for each of the nine\nfurnished levels of the residential tanks, and 60 percent\nmore for the communal tanks where galley equipment\nand chairs and tables for dining rooms would require\n\n= - - - - - 1 0 0 m ------i-I\n\n1--1\n\nI\n\nd~\n\n1\n\n12.5 m\n\n8.4m- ,\n\nt-...\n\nLlVIN GACCO MMODATIO\n\n"\'TUNNEL ( 2 )\n\n~\n\n~\n\nHUB\nI\n,\n\n~~~.qr\n~\n3 RPM\nECLSS MODULES (14)\n\nQ\n~\n\n~~-t\n\n7 ET LH2 TANKS\n\nRADIATION SHIELD 1.08 m\n\nFigure 1.- Habitat design for the SMF.

Table 10 summarizes the mass\nestimates for refurbishing the liquid hydrogen tanks for\nthe orbital habitats at LEO, at SMF, and at the catcher.\nFor the lunar surface habitats, a different design\napproach is required because of the necessity of burying\nthe habitats. Instead of a condominium tower configuration, the liquid hydrogen tanks must lie flat on their\nsides. The interior configuration is then a long two-story\nbungalow. Setting ceiling heights at 2.6 m (8 ft) leaves\nample room for storage, ducting, wiring, and plumbing\nalong the full length of the top and bottom of the tank\nand between the two levels in the sub flooring space.\nLeaving space for a companionway the full length of\neach level, with spiral stairways between levels, each\nlevel would provide six studio apartments approximately\n3.1 m by 4.5 m (10 by 14 ft), with about II m of tank\nlength on each level for communal facilities (galley,\ntoilets and baths, laundry, dining room, recreation facilities, and EVA preparation). Each tank would have two\nairlocks, and the two tanks at the initial main lunar base\nwould be connected by a tunnel to make a single habitat\nunit. When the main base is expanded, the third and\nfourth tanks can be similarly connected to the first two.\nEach tank thus provides private space for 12 persons\ninstead of 21. The floor area per person is somewhat\nsmaller, but this is psychologically compensated (in part)\nby daily work on the surface. With only 1/6 Earthnormal gravity, structural masses for flooring are smaller\nthan would be the case in the orbital habitats. We have\nthus estimated only 10 metric tons per tank for structure and furnishings; if two airlocks and one EC/LSS\npod are added, the total mass per tank is 37.5 tons. The\nenergy system to support 12 persons totals 62.5 tons\n(4.5 tons for photovoltaic arrays, 2.2 tons for radiators\n55 tons for flywheels, 0.8 ton for motor/generators and\nfor the control system).\n\nTABLE 10.- MASSES FOR ORBITAL\nHABITAT INTERIORS\nComponent\nCentral shaft for ea(;h tank:\nVertical tie rods (in\ntension)\nContinuous belt elevator system\n\n440\n400\nTotal\n\nF or each level:\nStructural flooring\n(12 panels)\nOuter edging and attachments to tank\nInner ring and attachments\nto tie rods\nRadial beams (12)\nDucting and plumbing\nLighting fixtures\nPartitions and wall\nfinishings\nAcoustic ceiling\nCarpeting or tiling\n\n45\n10\n90\n100\n100\n400\n120\n75\n\nTotal internal shell:\nCentral shaft\n9 floors, at 1740 kg\n\nIn an earlier section, we discussed the logistics of\ntransporting lunar and SMF crews from LEO by means\nof a chemically propelled OTV.

Conditions aboard would be distinctly\ncrowded, but such conditions can be tolerated for a\nvoyage of strictly limited duration. One passenger\nmodule must be provided for each OTV in the fleet. The\npassenger modules used for the lunar crews must differ\nsomewhat from those used for SMF crews because of the\ngreater duration of the lunar transfer, with more extensive galley and toilet facilities, consistent with the reduction in the number of passengers. The OTV passenger\nmodules, however, would seldom be used aboard the\nShuttle since the Shuttle payload capacity is considerably larger than the total mass of a fully loaded passenger module. Most of these modules would be delivered\nto LEO aboard the SD/HLV, with the passenger cabin\nfilled with such cargos as consumables for LEO or SMF.\nDuring the first year or two of launch operations\nbefore the lunar base begins operation, crews for the\nLEO station can ride to and from orbit in the Shuttle\ncabin, 4 or 5 at a time. Later on, when LEO crews and\nlunar crews are exchanged in lots of 24, and the SMF\ncrews are exchanged in groups of 150 or so, this mode of\noperation becomes impossible. Two or three Shuttle-bay\npassenger modules designed for a total flight time of\n1.5 to 3 hr would suffice, with double-deck, high-density\nseating provided for 60 passengers at a time, plus baggage. These Earth-launch modules should be provided in\n1987, and could be expected to weigh no more than the\nOTV modules since the life-support requirements are\nconsiderably simpler.\n\nMDRE FLEET EXPANSION\nOnce the lunar base has been established, the pace of\ntransporting supplies and equipment into orbit is sharply\naccelerated. A second MDRE is added to the fleet late in\n1986, and four more are added in 1987. Because of the\nhigher payload of the SD/HLV, there is a tendency for\npayloads for high orbit to accumulate faster than the\nrequisite external tanks for MDRE reaction mass. Late in\n1987, in anticipation of the arrival of the first cargo of\nlunar soils at the SMF, the first of eight large MDRE\'s\n(LMDRE) is delivered to LEO. Table 11 compares this\nvehicle with the original MDRE, making some assumptions about economies of scale possible for the larger\nmachine.\nThe first LMDRE is delivered to the SMF as cargo\naboard two MDRE flights shortly after initial operation\nof the SMF in February 1988. After assembly and\ncheckout are completed, the LMDRE makes a round trip\nto LEO to deliver 2100 tons of lunar material, enough\nreaction mass for three MDRE flights to the SMF (fully\nloaded with 1200 tons of cargo each time). Since the\nLMDRE is operating far below maximum ~pacity on\nthis flight, only 2400 tons of reaction mass are required\nto complete the round trip in about 2 months. The\nLMDRE is then used to haul larger masses of lunar soil\nfrom the catcher to the SMF since the launch rate at the\nlunar base begins to increase by mid-1988 to rates\nexceeding the capacity of the MDRE fleet.\nDuring 1988, 2000 metric tons of LMDRE components and subassemblies are delivered to the SMF which\n\nTABLE 11.- MASS DRIVER SPECIFICATIONS\nMetric tons\nMDRE\nDry weight at LEO\nReaction mass consumption rate\nReaction mass required for 4-month\ntrip from LEO to SMF with refueling at SMF\nPayload delivered from LEO to SMF\nLMDRE\nDry weight at LEO\nReaction mass consumption rate\nReaction mass required for 4-month\ntrip from LEO to SMF with refueling at SMF\nPayload delivered from LEO to SMF\n\n174 tons\n175 tons/month\n700 tons\n1,200 tons\n\n1,600 tons\n1,700 tons/month\n6,800 tons\n12,000 tons\n\n79\n\ncontributes 1200 tons of manufactured components\n(solar cells, cables, structural members) to complete two\nmore LMDRE\'s. During 1989, assuming that the SMF\ncan now contribute 50 percent of the mass of an\nLMDRE, 4000 tons of imported components and parts\npermit expansion of the LMDRE fleet by five more\nunits.\nThe fleet of eight LMDRE\'s is required to transport\nlunar materials from the catcher to the SMF; to transport liquid oxygen for chemical propulsion from the\nSMF to both LEO and LLO; to transport lunar material\nto LEO for the MDRE and LMDRE fleets; and to\ntransport (if necessary) chemical feedstocks for the manufacture of solar power satellites at the SMF. We have\narbitrarily assumed that 9000 metric tons of raw materials must be imported from Earth for each SPS totaling\n100,000 metric tons when completed. Annual transportation requirements for these chemical feedstocks would\nthen total 21,600 tons, which can be accommodated in\ntwo LMDRE flights. More detailed trajectory analyses\nare required to optimize the MDRE/LMDRE fleet and to\nconfirm some of the mass and flight time estimates used\nhere.\n\nEARTH LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS\nTable 12 summarizes the total launch requirements\nfor the scenario described here. The greatest single\nuncertainty concerns the question of how much mass\nmust be imported from Earth to supplement lunar raw\nmaterials in the manufacture of products such as solar\npower satellites. The lift requirements can be met in\n\nmany ways; table 13 shows an aggressive launch schedule\nusing the Shuttle, the SD/HLV, and the SSTO to meet\nthe milestones on the schedule described here. After\n1987, when a fifth SD/HLV is added, the Shuttle is used\nonly for crew transportation with a passenger module in\nthe cargo bay.\nShould it be possible to manufacture SPS\'s without\nany imports from Earth, the number of launches by the\nShuttle and the SD/HLV would be considerably\nreduced. The right half of table 13 shows the launch\nschedule that results from eliminating the chemical feedstocks column in table 12. Redistribution of the remaining cargos to produce a more even launch schedule has\nnot been attempted, nor have we considered in any\ndetail the changes in MDRE fleet size that would also\nresult. Use of the LMDRE to bring lunar materials to\nLEO for reaction mass would have to be accelerated\nbecause of the reduction in expendable Shuttle tanks.\nTable 14 summarizes the allocation of Shuttle tanks\nover the period 1985 to 1990. Each liquid hydrogen\ntank weighs 14.5 tons, while a complete tank set weighs\n33.45 tons. Thus the tank allocations must be converted\nto "equivalent tanks" to account for use of the rest of a\ntank set for reaction mass after the hydrogen tank has\nbeen converted into a habitat.\nIf the reduced launch schedule shown on the right\nside of table 13 is attainable, deployment of the singlestage-to-orbit vehicle (assumed to operate in a mixed\npassenger and cargo mode) could be postponed indefinitely, although costs per ton would be higher in that\ncase. After a number of years, the increased costs of\nusing the Shuttle and the SD/HLV would begin to rival\nthe discounted costs for development of the SSTO.\n\nTABLE 12.- SUMMARY OF LIFT REQUIREMENTS TO LEOa\n\nEquipment and\nsupplies for:\n\nYear\n\nVehicles\n\nLEO\n\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n\nSMF\n\nLLO\n\n290\n169.2\n70\n86.6\n70\n43\n43\n43\n43\n\n-----\n\n1266\n66.3\n1159.6\n1284.6\n1318\n231.6\n231.6\n231.6\n231.6\n\naMetric tons.\n\n80\n\n4173.5\n3490\n3540\n2980\n1600\n1600\n1600\n\nChemical\npropellants\n\nOTV\n\nMDRE\n\n174\n174\n696\n\n-----\n\nSubtotal\n\n---\n\n9.2\n9.6\n34.4\n203\n464\n1189\n735\n482.4\n482.4\n\n1,739.2\n1,739.6\n10,108.2\n10,471.4\n12,102\n6,107.2\n3,702.5\n3,265\n3,265\n\nChemical\nfeedstocks\n\nTotal\n\nLMDRE\n\n--\n\nCrew and\nbaggage\n\n13\n43.2\n277.2\n250.8\n627\n20.9\n\n-----\n\n---------\n\n1600\n2000\n4000\n\n-----\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n---\n\n1307.5\n. 2331.5\n3130\n2459.2\n1036.6\n\nIon\n908\n908\n\n----621.8\n981.6\n1,838\n8,542.8\n18,797.5\n21,600\n21,600\n\n1,739.2\n1,739.6\n10,730\n11,453\n13,940\n14,650\n22,500\n24,865\n24,865\n\nTABLE 13.- LAUNCH SCHEDULE (EARTH TO LEO)\n\nYear\n\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\nQ\n\nTotal\nQ\npayload\n(including\nchemicals),\nmetric tons\n\nNumber of flights\nSD/HLV\n\nSSTO\n\n60\n60\n60\n7\n16\n41\n\n1,739.2\n1,739.6\n10,730\n11,453\n13,940\n14,650\n22,500\n24,865\n24,865\n\nShuttle\n\n---\n\n1,739.2\n1,739.6\n10,108.2\n10,471.4\n12,102\n6,107.2\n3,702.5\n3,265\n3,265\n\n---\n\n---\n\n1,740\n1,740\n10,780\n11,503\n14,024\n14,749\n22,700\n24,970\n24,970\n\n---\n\n80\n100\n120\n120\n\nTotal\npayloadb\n(excluding\nchemicals),\nmetric tons\n\n---\n\n---\n\nTotal\nlaunch\ncapacity,\nmetric\ntons\n\n100\n110\n110\n\n---\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n-------\n\nNumber of flights\nShuttle\n\nSD/HLV\n\n60\n60\n60\n7\n16\n41\n28\n\n-----\n\n-----\n\n75\n91\n107\n45\n26\n\n-----\n\nTotal\nlaunch\ncapacity,\nSSTO metric\ntons\n\n-------------IS\nIS\n\n1,740\n1,740\n10,215\n10,486\n12,575\n6,274\n3,750\n3,405\n3,405\n\nAssuming 9% terrestrial chemical feedstock requirement.\n\nb Assuming no terrestrial chemical feedstock requirement.\n\nTABLE 14_- ALLOCATION OF SHUTTLE EXTERNAL TANKS\nLH2 tanks for habitats at:\nYear\nLEO\n\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n\nSMF\n\n6\n\n---\n\n-----\n\n28\n28\n28\n42\n42\n\n-------\n\nLunar\nCatcher\nbase\n\n2\n2\n\n---\n\n1\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have examined the logistiC feasibility of establishing a space manufacturing enterprise for the construction of solar power satellites in high Earth orbit, using\nlunar materials, operating within the constraints of\nSpace Shuttle and Shuttle-derived launch vehicle technologies_ Such a system, it seems, could be deployed in\nless than 8 years of launch activities maintained at an\naggressive pace; the launch activities follow 4 or 5 years\nof dedicated development and hardware procurement. If\nthe program commences at full speed in 1980 or 1981,\nthe first IO-GW SPS\'s could be on-line late in 1990; the\nsecond, late in 1991; and the third, early in 1992.\nCrew selection and training requirements and an\neconomic analysis of the program have also been carried\nthrough. These results will be reported elsewhere.\n\nEquivalent\ncomplete\ntanks\n\n4.4\n13.2\n12.4\n12.4\n18.6\n18.6\n\nChemical\npropellant\nstorage\ndepots\n\n3\n3\n3\n14\n\n-----\n\nMDRE\nreaction\nmass\n\nTotal\nexternal\ntanks\navailable\n\n52.6\n43.8\n124.6\n80.6\n117.4\n142.4\n\n60\n60\n140\n107\n136\n161\n\nDepending on a variety of assumptions about interest\nrates, discount rates, costs for competing sources of\nelectrical powerplants, and research and development\ncosts, the total investment for the period 1980 to 1992\n(when the third SPS is sold) lies roughly between\n$50 billion and $100 billion, equivalent (in 1977 dollars)\nto one or two times the Apollo program.\nA key technical problem that must be resolved at an\nearly date is the design of an SPS using only lunar\nmaterials. Should it prove impractical to design such an\nSPS or to design a factory to manufacture such an SPS,\nthe use of asteroidal materials (with a much greater\ndiversity of chemical elements available, especially such\nvolatiles as hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen) would be\nfavored.\nThe use of the mass driver as a reaction engine for\ncargo transportation beyond LEO provides significant\n\n81\n\nadvantages over chemical propulsion systems, as can be\nseen from an examination of the extensive propellant\nrequirements for personnel transportation alone, a small\nfraction of the total mass required to be transported\nbeyond LEO.\nHabitat designs based on use of the Shuttle external\ntank seem to offer numerous advantages and simplifications in the system considered. The orbital habitats\n(except for the intermittently occupied habitat at the\ncatcher) all provide near-Earth-normal gravity from the\nbeginning.\nThe location for the space manufacturing facility\nmust be optimized after the SPS design has been settled.\nDuring the early stages of the en terprise, however, a high\ncircular orbit appears to be strongly favored because of\nlogistic considerations.\nThe detailed scenario presented here is only one of\nmany possible design approaches, but it serves to show\nthat a space manufacturing enterprise is logistically feasible in the Shuttle era, albeit with significant technical\nrisks in such an aggressive program. The feasibility of\nundertaking such a program in the public sector or along\nconventionally organized lines in the private sector has\nnot been addressed here.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

SNOW\n\nA mass driver is an electrical device used to accelerate payloads of any material to a high velocity. Small vehicles\n(called "buckets") containing superconducting coils carry the payloads. These buckets are accelerated by pulsed magnetic fields, timed by information on their position, and are guided by induced magnetic fields set up in a surrounding\nguideway. Upon reaching the correct velocity, the buckets release their payloads, then they are slowed for recirculation\nto be reused. A rationale is presented that leads to a relatively simple and near-optimum design, as well as basic programs for calculating acceleration. The transverse oscillation frequencies are found to be invariant to guideway transverse dimensions. A detailed optimization of system mass and a discussion of all structural questions are presented in\nother papers of this summer study.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe theoretical development of mass-driver designs\nhas intensified since this concept was first published by\nO\'Neill (refs. 1,2). Much recent work is contained in\nunpublished notes. The three papers on mass drivers in\nthis Special Publication are therefore written to summarize the present body of knowledge; this introduction\ncontains references to the main sources of relevant information presently known.\nAfter the first publication on mass drivers, the next\nsubstantial design effort occurred during the 1976\nNASA-Ames Study on Space Manufacturing. In that\nstudy, there was active participation by professionals\nwith experience in linear synchronous motors and magnetic flight.\nTwo mass-driver configurations were considered at\nthe 1976 study: planar and axial. The planar system, a\nflattened, double-sized version of the M.I. T. magneplane\n(ref. 3), had served as the basis for the first mass-driver\nreference design, partly because calculations could be\n\nchecked against existing computer programs. The axial\nconfiguration (fig. 1) was eventually recognized as\nsuperior, particularly for reaction engine applications\ninvolving maximum exhaust velocity and minimum total\nsystem mass. Axial geometry permits tighter inductive\ncoupling between vehicle and drive coils and therefore\nDRIVE COILS\n\no d\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1850\n\nFigure 1.- Axial configuration for mass driver. Two\n\ncoils are used in the bucket; drive coils energized\nseparately to maximize acceleration and efficiency.\n\n87\n\nhigher acceleration for the same total system mass. Basic\nformulas for mass optimization, general enough to apply\nto a wide variety of mass drivers (both planar and axial\ndesigns), are given in references 4 and 5.\nThe 1976 study served to verify and extend the basic\nmass-driver concept, to reveal the advantages of axial\ngeometry, to pruduce the mass-optimization formulas,\nand to develop a method for payload guidance after\nrelease. It yielded the important result that accelerations\nof the order of 104 m/sec 2 are almost certainly realizable in mass drivers of moderate transverse dimensions.\nBuilding on this foundation, substantial advances\nwere made during the 1976-77 academic year. In a series\nof four seminars,l the basic design for a mass driver of\nhigh performance (6,000 to 10,000 m/sec) and low\nsystem mass (100\xc2\xb7200 tons) was developed for application to reaction engines in space. In the seminar series,\nthe transverse oscillation scaling laws were derived, a\nsimple program for calculating acceleration was written,\nand improvements were made in obtaining maximum\ndrive for minimum power loss in the drive windings.\nThese results were summarized concisely, without\nderivations, at the 1977 Princeton/ AIAA Conference on\nSpace Manufacturing (ref. 6). In that paper, the concept\nwas applied to an engine used to move large amounts of\nequipment from low Earth orbit (LEO) to lunar orbit.\nDuring the same period, the first mass-driver model\nwas designed and built at M.l.T.: construction was\ndirected by Henry Kolm and a number of the authors of\nthis paper took part in the assembly and testing. The\nmodel, 2 m long with simplified circuits, demonstrated\nacceleration only; no attempt was made to combine a\ntest of magnetic flight. It operated successfully in the\nacceleration range of tens of gravities and was widely\ndemonstrated. Its design is covered in reference 7 and its\nconstruction, in reference 8.\nThe state of the art of the theoretical design of mass\ndrivers as of September 1977 was summarized at the\nInternational Astronautical Federation Conference of\nthat year (ref. 9).\n\nEARLIER WORK ON AXIAL SUPERCONDUCTING\nACCELERATORS\nIt has come to our attention that, in addition to the\nextensive bibliography listed in reference 5, a "traveling1 O\'Neill, G. K.: Space Flight via Maxwell\'s Equations.\nSpecial Seminar Series, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, M.l.T., 1977 (unpublished work).\n\n88\n\nwave accelerator" for superconducting solenoids was\nproposed and studied earlier by F. Winterberg and\nco-workers at the Desert Research Institute, University\nof Nevada, Reno (refs. 10, 11).\nIn discussing the differences between the mass-driver\nconcept and the Winterberg traveling-wave accelerator,\nwe should note the several key elements of the massdriver system: a linear synchronous motor for acceleration, guidance by magnetic flight, and recirculation of\nthe accelerated vehicle, with only the payload leaving\nthe system. Winterberg\'s system differed from the mass\ndriver in that he made no provision to maintain synchronization by silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) switching\non the basis of position sensing. Instead, the coils and\ncapacitors were selected to form a lumped parameter\ntransmission line having a local phase velocity that provides uniform acceleration of the traveling wave. This\nwas accomplished by making 1/v\'LC (where Land Care\ninductance and capacitance per unit length) equal to the\ncorrect local velocity. Winterberg showed by approxi\xc2\xb7\nmate analysis that phase stability should be achieved. He\nalso found that resonance (in phase) should be confined\nto a very small region at the beginning of the track, and\nthat angular instability should be controllable by the\nrelative position of the center of thrust and the center of\nmass of the accelerated solenoid.\nHe concluded, however, that there will be inherently\nunstable transverse translational motion because, in his\nsystem, the vehicle always rode the front crest of the\ntraveling step function. In the axial mass driver, the\nbucket is first attracted and then repelled by each drive\ncoil. Attraction has a centering effect, while repulsion\nhas a destabilizing effect. The net stability is therefore\nneutral under completely symmetric timing conditions.\nIf, however, the wave form is m, de asymmetric so that\nthe attractive pulse is of larger amplitude than the repulsive pulse, then the net effect will be stabilization of\nlateral motion. In the latest mass-driver circuit design, it\nis easy to achieve stabilizing asymmetry by making the dc\nfeeder voltages (capacitor charge) unequal to the extent\nrequired.\n\nDESIGN RATIONALE\nThere are many possible choices in the design of mass\ndrivers, and optimizations will change both as the result\nof further refinements in design and of improvements in\nmaterials (especially superconductors) and components\n(capacitors and SCR\'s in particular). We do not wish to\nhalt that process of continual refinement, but we feel\n\nthat the present state of knowledge is sufficient to\njustify setting out a "nominal" family of designs, for\nwhich the potential user can calculate performance,\nsystem mass, and sensitivities to changes in materials,\ncomponents, and the main variables of payload size,\nrepetition frequency, maximum velocity, and acceleration. Here we consider the electrical design of a particular family of mass drivers (aXial geometry, with a specified value for the ratio of bucket to drive coil radii) in\nthe approximation that accelerations are calculated for\ncurrents taken to be thin filaments. In reference 12, we\nconsider large-scale structural questions; in reference 13,\nwe present optimization formulas and programs.\nTable 1 presents the nomenclature used in all three\npapers. Where the notation had already been chosen in\nearlier publications, we adopted the same notation. For\neasy reference, table 1 also contains the specific design\nchoices corresponding to our family of designs (discussed below). With our design choices, all main dimensions of the bucket and all transverse dimensions of the\ndrive system are fixed when the drive coil diameter D is\nchosen (where D is referred to as the "caliber," but it is\nnot equal to the clear diameter through which the\nbucket passes; that clear diameter is smaller than D\nbecause of the finite cross section of the drive coil,\nnecessary insulators or supports, and finite thickness of\nthe guideway).\nIn table 1, several approximations are implicit. The\nminimum velocity is approximately zero in calculating\nta , Sa\' Sd, and Stat. Drift space and bucket deflection\nspace (peel-off length) reqUired to separate the bucket\nfrom the payload after release are neglected in calculating Stat. As defined, Stat is the correct parameter to use\nin mass-optimization formulas, but it is smaller than the\nphysical length of the complete mass-driver system. The\nterm Lw is based on a simple calculation of selfinductance and mutual inductance, and does not take\nfull account of the detailed changes in currents in the\ndrive coils adjacent to the coil whose inductance is\ncalculated.\n\nTRANSVERSE SCALING\nFor our family of designs, we have chosen to leave\n0: = r/R fixed at 0.52. This choice is arbitrary; a reasoned\nchoice would require knowledge we do not yet have, as\nwe now show.\nThe magnetic-flight guidance forces are restoring for\nthe two orthogonal position oscillations in the transverse\ndirection and the two orthogonal angular oscillations. To\n\nfirst order, longitudinal motion depends only on the\ndrive currents, and there is no restoring force for the roll\nmode. A practical mass driver might be wound with\nbucket and drive coils slightly non circular to provide a\nrestoring torque for roll.\nWe chose, in our family of designs, to scale all linear\ndimensions of the bucket with caliber D, and now calculate the approximate transverse oscillation frequency for\nD = 5.0 cm. We consider the guideway to be composed\nof eight strips of equal width and approximate the\nbucket coil as octagonal (see fig. 2). Assume that a\nparticular current element of the bucket of length y is\ninfluenced only by the parallel guideway strip nearest to\nit. Thus, for each of the eight bucket coil sides, only a\nsingle image current is needed to describe the force F\nfelt by that side. When the bucket is centered,\n.\n\n2\n\n/lalB y\n\nF= - 21TS\n\nwhere y = 20:D(tan 45\xc2\xb0/2) and /la is the permeability\nconstant. To sum the forces on all sides of the bucket\nwhen the bucket is displaced a distance x from the\ncenterline position, the restoring force that acts to\nreturn the bucket to the centered position is\n. 2\n4\n/lalB XY\n\nF= ---:::21TS2\n\nHere half of the contribution to the restoring force\ncomes from sides 1 and 5, while half comes from sides 2,\n4, 6, and 8. The corresponding spring constant is\n2000 N/m. For S = 0.3 D/2, leaving a distance 0.18 D/2\nfor the finite half-thickness of the drive coils, for insulation, and for the finite thickness of the guide strips, the\nrestoring force for larger displacements is given in\nfigure 3. For bucket mass given by our nominal design,\nthe corresponding oscillation frequency is 37.3 Hz. The\nnotation in this derivation, as in table 1, is that of\nreference 4.\nConsider next the effect on bucket transverse motion\ncaused by scaling mass-driver linear dimensions proportional to D. The dimensions R, r, s, and y all scale\nlinearly with D. The cross-sectional area of the bucket\ncoil is D2. If it is assumed that the current density in the\nsuperconducting bucket coil remains constant, the current flow i B will also scale as D2 .

There is an extensive literature treating such oscillations, as a result of the\n30 years of previous development of particle accelerator\ntheory and practice. At a more sophisticated level of\ndesign knowledge on mass drivers, it will be necessary to\ninvestigate how the misalignments that drive oscillation\nbuildup scale withD. At our present level, we must close\nthe argument at this point with the comments that we\nlack sufficient knowledge to proceed further, and that\nactive feedback should be much easier in our case than\nfor particle accelerators: we are dealing with a macroscopic bucket, of fixed shape, whose position can be\nmeasured to very high precision by optical scanning. The\nbucket moves very slowly compared to the velocity of\nlight, so there is ample time to measure, calculate, and\nfeed back correction currents to steering coils located at\nintervals along the guideway. In reference 13, we show\nthat the mass of a total optimized accelerator changes\nonly slowly as a function of D so long as the mass flow\ndm 1 Idt and vmax are held constant. Therefore, the\nchoice of D does not appear to be critical and can be\ndeferred until a more thorough understanding of misalignments is reached.\n\nkg\n\n160\n\n2R\n\n= 2560 amp\n\n50\n\n140 0\n\nRadius Ratio\n\nf-\n\nW\n\n::>",\n120 ~w\'\n2 40\nw\'\n\nu\n\nDRIVE COIL\n\na:\n0\n\n"(!l\n\n~\na:\n\nPo\n\n30\n\nf-O\n\n100\n\nCLEARANCE GAP\n\nT\n\n= 0.3\n\nWa:\n\n80\n\ntlg\n\xc2\xab",\n\n60\n\n" T\no\n\n~\n\nf-W\n\nwa:\n\no BUCKET COIL\n\n20\n\n~~\n~~\n\nR\n\n"\n\nf-\n\n\'"\na:\n\n.1\n\nII\n\n0\n\nw\n\no\n\nQ~\n\n40\n\n::>\n\n\'"\n\n10\n20\n\no\n\n~~==~\n\n__ __ __\n~\n\n~\n\nL-~\n\n__-+~O\n\n5\n\nTRANSVERSE DISPLACEMENT. mm\n\nFigure 3.- Restoring force profile as calculated in\napproximation represented by figure 2.\n\nyKlmB, will be invariant to the caliber D, and so the\nmaximum tolerable angle of bucket motion relative to\nthe axis will also scale as D.\nIn the absence of active feedback from steering coils\nplaced at intervals along the guideway, the bucket oscil-\n\nTighter coupling would be obtained with a higher\nvalue of the radius ratio rlR. However, this would reduce\nthe clearance gap between bucket and guideway. For\na = 0.52 (from ref. 4) and for bucket and drive coil\nwidths of O.lD, the total allowance for insulation, guide\nstrips, clearance, and thermal insulation surrounding the\nsuperconducting coil is O.l4D, or 0.7 cm for D = 5 cm.\nIt does not seem realistic to reduce clearance by using a\nmuch higher value of a; the dependence of the peak\ngradient of mutual inductance on rlR is shown in\nfigure 4, along with the peak mutual inductance with\nrespect to rlR, which also does not justify a tighter\ncoupling.\n\nBucket Coil Cross Section\nWe chose square coils of width 0.1 D. If the coils were\nmuch thicker, the drive current pulse could not be timed\nto optimize the drive simultaneously on all parts of the\ndrive coil, and therefore the efficiency would be lost.\nOur choice could probably be altered by \xc2\xb125 percent.\n\n91\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n2500\n\nI\nI\n\n.!..\n\n2000\n\nE\n\nJ:\n\n\'"\nb\n\n1500\n\n~\n\n/\n\ni 1000\n-~\n\n~I~\n\nE = n 2 ie (dM/dt)\n\nI\n\n3000\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n//\n\n...--------i\'\\..., )---------,\n\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n\n4\n\nCURR~\n\nI\nJ:\n\n.,\n\n,\n\nI\n\n~\n\nC\n\n~ ""><G<V,I\n\nR\n\n~\n\n.\n~\n\n3~\n::;:\n\nSCR\n\n/,//\n\n500\n\n..,,-\'"\n0\n\n.1\n\n.2\n\n",\'"\n\n.4\n.5\n.6\n.3\n.7\nBUCKET COil RADIUS\na\nDRIVE COil RADIUS R\n\n(1:.)=\n\nFigure 5.- Equivalent circuit for electrical drive; single\ncoil shown represents two adjacent drive coils of one\nphase, connected through a neutral bus.\n\nNOTE: DRIVE COil RADIUS TAKEN TO BE 0.0254m\n\nFigure 4.- Variation of peak value of dm/dx, mutual\ninductance axial gradient, with rlR of bucket/drive\ncoil radii.\n\nSuperconducting Cable Density and Current\n\nadditional generator corresponding to the induced EMF\ndue to bucket motion.

The choice rests on practical operating experience with the MJ.T. magneplane model.\nDrive Frequency, Coil Spacing, and Energy Transfer\nThe instantaneous force on one bucket coil due to\none drive coil is iB(dM/dx)iDCt) , where iD(t) is the value\nof the ampere-turns in the drive coil at time t (ref. 4). In\nreference 6, it was found convenient to integrate the\ndrive force over the x region of drive coil excitation, to\nobtain the total energy change imparted to each bucket\ncoil in traversing each drive coil. During the same interval, the energy loss in the drive coil is proportional to\n!i[/(t)dt. We therefore obtain maximum energy transfer\nto the bucket, at minimum power loss in the drive coil,\nby maximizing l!iB(dM/dx)iD(t)dx]/!id(t)dt. The\nproblem is slightly complicated by the fact that the\ninduced EMF caused by the moving bucket coil in the\ndrive coil affects di D/dt; the current cycle in the drive\nwinding is therefore not exactly sinusoidal when a\ncharged capacitor is connected to the winding.\nAlthough our actual basic drive circuit consists of two\ndrive coils, separated by the spacing of the bucket coils\nand operated in series from a capacitor, that circuit is\nequivalent to the simpler one shown in figure 5; that is, a\nsingle drive coil with its self-inductance, mutual inductance, and internal resistance, across a capacitor, with an\n\n92\n\ni=Ce;C)\nwhere t is time, dM/dt is the time rate of change of the\nmutual inductance between the total current of one\nbucket coil and one turn of the drive coil, and R is the\nresistance of a drive winding having n2 turns. By the\nchain rule,\n\nFor numerical computation, we put these formulas into\ndifference-equation form with Vc and i as functions of x\nrather than of t and solve for 6.i and 6.Vc:\n(6.x)R\n\n6.V = _ (6.x) i\n\nc\n\nvC\n\nfor stepwise integration with a step interval 6.x. The\nvelocity v is considered to be constant over the short\ninterval in x over which one drive coil acts - an excellent approximation for all but the first few drive coils of\nthe accelerator. Cast in this form, dM/dx is an explicit\n\nfunction of x, independent of n2 but dependent on the\ncaliber D. For purposes of calculation, the four constants appearing in the difference equations are called\nsuccessively ai, ao, a3, and a4\xc2\xb7\nThe calculation can be carried out with high accuracy\nby use of a program for dM/dx (see appendix A), combined with a difference-equation routine. Alternatively,\na good approximation is obtained much more compactly\nby a simpler program (see footnote 1) (appendix B).\nThis program carries out the stepwise integration of the\ndifference equations for Vc and i, and yields the total\nenergy transfer to the bucket coil; the program occupies\nless than 50 program steps and so can be run on even a\nsmall programmable calculator.\nBy use of this simple program, it was found in the\npaper in footnote 1 and noted in reference 6 that a very\ngood, although not necessarily an ideally optimized,\nsolution is obtained by matching the peak in the i(x)\ncurve to the peak in the curve of dM/dx (fig. 6). If that\nis done, the sine wave of the drive current is turned on\nwhen the bucket coil is a distance 0.37D before the drive\ncoil. We call the distance 0.185D, the "inductance\nlength," Qm.\ndM/dx CURVE AND DRIVE CURRENT WAVEFORM\n\nX AXIS IS DIRECTION\nOF TRAVEL\n\nTHE DRIVE FORCE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PRODUCT\nOF dM/dx AND id\n\nFigure 6.- Matching of the drive current wave form to\nshape of dM/dx curve, for approximate maximization\nof drive efficiency.\nWe obtain a particularly simple geometry and drive\ncircuit by choosing a spacing between drive coils equal\nto the inductance length. In that case, successive coils\ncarry currents 90\xc2\xb0 apart in phase. Only two independent\ncircuits are needed to feed all coils in a given region of\n\nthe accelerator, one circuit for even-numbered coils,\nanother circuit to feed odd-numbered coils.\nNumber of Bucket Coils\nWith progressive refinement of our understanding, we\nhave adopted a drive system in which each coil is separately excited (ref. 5) through its own switches (SCR\'s).\nFor historical reasons, the number of bucket coils previously chosen was four, in the case of axial symmetry.\nHowever, with each drive coil separately excited, we\nconsider anew the question of the optimum number of\nbucket coils.\nFor stability against pitch and yaw, the minimum\nnumber of bucket coils is two. A possibility (not considered further here) is that one of these two coils might\ncarry most of the total current, the other having low\nmass and current and intended only to provide stability.\nConsider two alternative bucket designs, of the same\ntotal superconductor mass, divided in one case into four\ncoils and, in the other, into only two coils. To provide\nequal total energy transfer to the moving bucket, the\ndrive currents required are the same in both cases\nbecause that energy transfer is proportional to the product of peak drive current, current per bucket coil, and\nnumber of bucket coils. However, for two coils, each\ndrive winding need only be excited for two complete\nsine waves, while for four coils, four cycles of excitation\nare needed. Therefore, the power loss is reduced by\none-half with two coils, for equal drive-winding mass.\nOur choice is thus nc = 2.\nFeeder losses are also reduced in the two-coil case.\nFor full drive in these drive windings, current must\nprecede and follow each bucket coil. In the notation in\nreference 5, the number nw of windings simultaneously\nexcited is reduced from six for four coils to four in the\ncase of two coils. In the section on drive circuit, we\nreduce nw to two. Figure 7 traces the winding currents\nas the bucket moves.\nBucket Length\nThe spacing between the two bucket coils could be\nany multiple of the spacing between drive coils. We\nadopt a specific value, with the note that changing to a\nlonger bucket to accommodate a low-density payload\nwould have little effect on bucket mass and no effect on\naccelerator mass. Given sufficient built-in flexibility in\nthe coil triggering system, it may be possible to accommodate different bucket lengths even in a single\naccelerator.\n\n93\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n2\n\ncb\n1\n\nBUCKET\nCOIL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n2\n\n~\n\n~\n\nQ\n\n1\n\nPHASE OF\nCURRENT\n\nt\n\nFI RST SNAPSHOT\n\nPUSH\n-P-ULL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n2\n\nFEEDER\n\n0\n1\n\nVELOCITY\n\nPHASE\n\nC\nC!:\n\nSE\nI\nPHASE 2\nFEEDER\n\nPHASE\n1\n\n*C\n\nPHASE\n\n~C\n\n2\n\nII I \xe2\x80\xa2 I I \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSECOND SNAPSHOT, 45\xc2\xb0 LATER\nIN PHASE; CURRENTS 0,707 OF PEAK,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDRIVE\nCOILS\n\nSCR PAIR\n\nNEUTRAL\n\no o\n1\n\no\n\nPH~SEVPHASE\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\'--"\n\nBRIDGING BETWEEN ADJACENT SECTORS\n\n2\n\nl----\xc2\xa3s--1\n-;,~ 1\n\nTHIRD SNAPSHOT, ANOTHER 45\xc2\xb0 LATER;\n\n2\n\nFigure 7.- Phase and amplitude of drive currents as\nbucket moves through drive coils.\n\nUmits on Drive-Coil Spacing\n\n(FEEDER)\n\nFigure 8.- Electrical circuit for bipolar two-phase\nsystem, with bridging switches between sectors to\nreduce the optimized mass of capacitors and feeders,\n\nThe fractional induced voltage is approximately\ninversely proportional to spacing. For an actual multiphase system, it is necessary to sum the effects of all\ncoils appropriately phased, as summarized below for\n112\n\nWe have chosen for simplicity a two-phase drive\nsystem, with the spacing between coils equal to \xc2\xa3m. All\ncoils are connected in the same sense, and the bipolar\nfeeder always sends current to two adjacent coils of one\nphase, which are connected by a common neutral\n(fig. 8). From the viewpoint of placing the drive currents\nin the best possible geometric location, drive windings\nshould probably be distributed uniformly, in a thin layer\nforming a continuous solenoidal coil. That alternative\nwill be studied in the future. We consider here the\npractical limits on coil spacing set by the simplicity of\nthe circuit we have adopted, but allowing for the possibility of a multi phase drive (more than two phases).\nIn the mass optimization for the entire mass driver,\nfeeder and capacitor mass can be saved by operating\nwith each drive winding subdivided into n2 turns, with\nfl2 as large as possible, For typical mass-driver parameters, the most serious limit on fl2 is set by the mutual\ninductance MD between drive windings, For drive\nampere-turns iD, the induced voltage from this source is\n(112MD)wLCiD\' This effect increases the SCR standoff\nvoltage by a certain fraction, independent of\nacceleration.\n\n94\n\nI 4o>---P-HA-S-E-l-Ir~\n\n(PHASE 2 IS IDENTICAL)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\no o o\n\nC\n\n= 1.\nDrive coil\nspacing, cm\n1.0\n\nTotal induced voltage as\nfraction of applied voltage\n0.28\n\n.6\n\n.72\n\n.2\n.1\n\n2.24\n4.4\n\nEvidently, the induced voltage caused by current\nchanges in adjacent drive coils limits 112 and also limits\nthe minimum spacing between drive coils.

Much higher values of 112\nwould result in a much-increased standoff requirement\nfor the SCR\'s.\n\nPayload Dimensions\nThe bucket length \xc2\xa3B is chosen as\nspacings (6\xc2\xa3m = \xc2\xa3B = l.1ID).

Thus the clearance gap\nbetween the outer surface of the payload and the bucket\ncoils is O.l2R = 0.06D. The ratio of bucket length/\ndiameter is thus 1.95 (taking into account the finite\nthickness of the bucket coils) and the ratio of payload\nlength to diameter is 3.08.\nFor a payload of density PP\' the caliber D is then\n\nWe assume a nominal Pp\n\n= 2X 10 3\n\nkg/m 3 .\n\nDrive Circuit\nThere are two bipolar feeder lines (two split phases)\nplus one neutral line, and the two feeders are in quadrature, that is, their currents differ in phase angle by 90\xc2\xb0 .\nDrive coils are all identical and are connected to the\nneutral line on one side, their other side being connected\nto the four feeders of alternating side and alternating\nphase (fig. 8). The resulting phasor diagrams are also\nshown in figure 8. Note that there are only four simultaneously excited coils during the passage of one bucket\ncoil, and that there are always two coils connected in\nseries across one bipolar feeder pair, although the coil\nconnections progress in a leapfrog fashion along the\nfeeder pair. Each coil is fired independently by its own\n0\nbipolar SCR, which conducts during one entire 360\ncycle, whose period is matched approximately to the\nlocal velocity by the choice of local LC product.\nBridging SCR\'s connect adjacent feeder pairs so long\nas a bucket occupies one of them. This arrangement\neliminates the need to double the capacitor energy of\nindividual sector capacitors to allow for the fact that\ntwo bucket coils will occupy each sector most of the\ntime. Bridging SCR\'s allow each bucket to derive energy\nfrom two adjacent feeder sectors, and the average conduction distance remains unchanged. Feeder power loss\nis unaffected, and the number of windings simultaneously driven by one sector capacitor nw is reduced to\ntwo.\nThe ringing frequency of the drive circuit (wLC in\nprevious terminology) is chosen to make the coil spacing\nor inductance length equal to one-quarter wavelength:\n\nf\n\n- wLC _ v\n\n_ v\n\n--- --- -21T\n4Q\nQ\nm\np\n\nThe "microduty cycle" defined in reference 6 is now\nunity. The feeders carry continuous current.\n\nSUMMARY\nIn this discussion of mass-driver electrical design,\nseveral small improvements have been made relative to\nour previous studies. The bucket design is Simplified by\nreducing the number of coils to two. That change\nreduces winding losses by 1/2 and feeder losses to 2/3\nthe previous value. Feeders are reduced from three\nphases to two. Bridging SCR\'s offer savings by a factor\nof 2 in the total capacitor energy storage required. Our\napplication of these changes to the reoptimization of\ntotal system mass is treated in reference 13. At a later\ntime, it would be worthwhile to consider a wider class of\ndesigns than those we treat here.

The\nentire program is designed to run on an HP-25 pocket\ncalculator with 49 program steps. Given a larger calculator or computer, one could generalize the program by\nusing a more exact expression for dM/dx or (more usefully) by including the finite cross sections of the drive\nand bucket coils.\nThe simple program consists of four subroutines:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Update x\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Calculate dM/dx\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Solve difference equation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Test for zero current\n\nIn normal use, registers R5 and R7 (summation of\ni(dM/dx) and i) are initialized to zero. Register 6 (Ve) is\nset to the initial voltage on the capacitor. The calculator\nis started, and the program then traces the half-cycle of\noscillation from the starting value of x (normally a\nnegative number stored in Rl) until current i goes negative. The summation is then recalled from R5, and the\ncalculation is repeated with different values of Ve until\nthe correct value of the sum, corresponding to the\ndesired energy transfer to the bucket, is found. The peak\ndrive current i D is then obtained from\n\nRl\n\nInitial value of position x (in m) at which drive\ncoil switch is closed.

Register 2 contains a constant whose integer and fractional parts are both used in the dM/dx\nsubroutine. The step interval LlX appears as a sequence\nof four key strokes in steps 01-04. (All constants are in\nMKS units.) In detail, the registers store information as\nshown in table 5.\n\n98\n\nAs normally used, the program calculates the energy\ntransfer for a half-cycle of oscillation. The total energy\ntransfer for a two-coil bucket, corresponding to the\npassage of both bucket coils through one drive coil, is\nthen (LlX)(4n2iB) (summation ofinM/dx in register 5).\nTypically, a step interval LlX of 1 mm is used, 0.001\nin program steps 01-04. Each step interval requires\n3.75 sec on an HP-25, and about twice that time on an\nHP-67 , so a half-cycle of oscillation with D = 5.0 cm\nrequires a little over 1 min (see table 6).\n\nTABLE 6.- CALCULATOR PROGRAM FOR\nENERGY TRANSFER TO MOVING\nBUCKET\n\n~~}\n\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\n09\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n~~}\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

O\'NEILL,\nand WILLIAM R. SNOW\n\nVarious structural and dynamical problems related to both small-scale forces between the drive coils and within the\nbucket structure as well as the overall combined large-scale dynamical interaction of the bucket stream and MDRE\nstructure are examined. The large-scale dynamics appear weakly stable. Finally, MDRE operation in an inverse-squarelaw gravitational field is discussed and the required curved shape of the guideway is computed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSMALL-SCALE FORCES AND STRESSES\n\nIn the following sections we discuss various structural\nand dynamical problems associated with operation of\nmass drivers. First, because of the very large accelerations (~103_104 m/s2) we are concerned with the\nvarious forces and stresses between the drive coils and\nwithin the bucket; in particular, the stresses on the\nsuper-conducting coils. We then compute the "tear-off\npoint," that point along the MDRE at which the feeder\nstructure alone can no longer support the imposed axial\nstress, and supplemental strengthening must be incorporated, probably in the form of steel cables.\nWe next examine the large-scale dynamical interaction of the bucket stream with the primary load bearing\nMDRE electrical structure. The bucket stream is\nmodeled as a fluid stream whose acceleration along the\nlimp MDRE structure provides the tension force in both\nthe acceleration and deceleration section. The transverse\noscillations of this structure are computed. Finally some\nconsideration is given to the problems of steering a\nMDRE and the requirements for operation in an inversesquare gravitational field. In particular the necessary\nchanges to the nominal straight form of the MDRE in\nfree space are computed for operation in a gravitational\nfield.\n\nMass Driver Structure\nViewed in the macroscopic scale, the mass-driver\n(MD) structure experiences an overall tension which is\ndue to the gross acceleration of buckets down the length\nof the track. Under closer examination, however, the\nforces that act on the support structure between individual drive coils are seen to behave in a manner such that\nboth local compression and local tension are experienced. To determine the stresses to which the support\nstructure between drive coils will be subjected, and\nhence must be designed to withstand, it is necessary to\nfirst determine a time-dependent description of the small\nscale forces acting on any individual drive coil. With this\nin hand, it will then be possible to come to some\nconclusion concerning the forces exerted on the structure between two adjacent drive coils.\nDue to the triggering mechanism in the electric circuit, current is permitted to flow in a drive coil only\nwhen a bucket coil is within a distance of 2Q m from that\ndrive coil. During the period in which it is on, the drive\ncoil will experience inductive forces not only with the\nbucket coil, but also with other neighboring drive coils\nwhich themselves have current flow. Calculations reveal\n\n101\n\nthat the reaction force on the drive coil due to the\nbucket coil is actually an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the reaction forces due to the other neighboring\ndri ve coils.\nThe force interaction between the bucket coil and the\ndrive coil is described by the equation (ref. 1):\n\n. . dM\nF = IBID dx\n\n(1)\n\nwhere iB is the constant current in the bucket; iD is the\ntime-varying current in the drive coil; and dM/dx is the\ngradient of the mutual inductance between drive and\nbucket coils and is a function of distance separating the\ncoils. Figure 1 plots the reaction force felt by a drive coil\ndue to the passage of a bucket coil. While the force\ncalculations presented are made for the specific case of a\nmass driver reaction engine of caliber 0.0508 m (ref. 2),\nthey are nonetheless typical of all mass drivers in terms\nof general behavior (though not necessarily in terms of\nmagnitude). Because of the an tisymmetry of both the iD\nand dM/dx curves, the bucket coil receives twin impulses\nfrom the drive coil - first it is pulled towa rd the drive\ncoil as it approaches, and next it is shoved away from\nthe drive coil as it departs downstream.\nThe second source of forces acting on the drive coil\nresults from inductive interactions with other active\nneighboring drive coils. These forces are described\nequally well by equation (1) if the neighboring drive coil\ncurrent is substituted for the bucket current and a differ-\n\nent dM/dx curve, one applicable to equal radii coils, is\nused.\nOver a short distance (typically several centimeters),\nit is reasonable to assume that bucket velocity V is\nconstant. With a fixed drive coil spacing (Q m ), then, the\ntime the bucket coil takes to travel from one drive coil\nto the next, t, is also constant and equal to Qm/V. The\ncurrent flow in each drive coil is sinusoidal, and designed\nto have a period of 4t. Consequently, any two adjacent\ndrive coils, if active, will be 90\xc2\xb0 out-of-phase with each\nother, and at any particular moment, current will be\nsimultaneously flowing in four contiguous drive coils.\nFigure 2 indicates which drive coils will be active during\neach of four quarter-wave phases of a reference drive\ncoil. The appendix documents the specific force equations and presents a calculator program to solve those\nequations. The results from the appendix are plotted in\nfigure 3.\nThrough the superposition of the force exerted on a\ndrive coil due to passage of a bucket coil and the force\nexerted on that drive coil due to its neighboring drive\ncoils, a complete description of the total force exerted\non the drive coil may be ascertained. A plot of this is\nshown in figure 4, from which it may be seen that the\ncoil experiences forces in both the positive and negative\ndirections.\n\n--1-+\n\n= nOll0UO= ==\n=0\n\nDRIVE COIL 1\nNUMBER\n\n4\n\n3\n\nMORE\n\nI\n\nI\n\n11 = 0.52\nR=0.0254m\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nF=isio~\n\n1m = 0.0095 m\nis\n\n6\n\n~Qm:~\n\nQUARTER - WAVE PHASES\n, I \' II I III I IV I\n\n= 2560 amp\n\nI\n\no\nOF: :\no\n\nis\n\n12\n\nz\n\nI\nI\n\n~ 5\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6\n\nI\n\n,\n\n-I\n\no\n\n-51\n\nFigure 1.- Force on drive coil due to bucket coil.\n\n102\n\n-41\n\n-31\n\n-21\n\nI\n\nI\n\n21\n\n-I\n\n21\n\nTIME\n\n(iomin\n\n":~\':\n\nL---\'---_L---\'---_\'----:---\'~ . .L\n-21\n\nlliolmax\nI\n\nI\n\n~\n\ni:~\n\na:\n\no\n\nI\n\nI\n\n::: 4\no\nu\n\niO\n\nI\n\nI\n\n~,\n:\n~\n\n<Xl\n\n"\n\nI\n\nI\n\nt\n\n~:J\n\n::;: 3\n::>\n\nb\n\n!\n\nI\n\nI\n\n~:\n\n--\n\na: 2\nw\n\n: -:\'-4i-:\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFORCE.

Consider a section of the mass driver\ntrack in which the bucket velocity is substantially less\nthan the speed of sound for the support structure material (for aluminum, approximately 5000 m/sec). If the\nvelocity of the bucket is assumed to be constant, then\neach drive coil will propagate identical stress waveforms\nwith identical periods, and the net force felt by a structural member joining two adjacent drive coils will be the\ndifference in the instantaneous force exerted on each\ncoil individually. Figure 5 graphically displays this difference in force (assuming constant bucket velocity) for the\nexample mass-driver reaction engine. From this figure, it\nmay be observed that the tension to be sustained in the\nmaterial is roughly twice as great as the compression and\n\nIf the bucket velocity is equal to or in excess of the\nspeed of sound for the structural material, then the\nstress wave caused by the passage of a bucket coil will\nnever reach the following sequential drive coil before the\ntime that that coil starts to propagate its own stress\nwave. Considering the bucket velocity to be constant, all\ndrive coils will experience the same forces within the\nsame length of time. Hence, all coils will propagate the\nsame tension waves in one direction and the corresponding compression waves in the other.\nSince these waves all propagate at the same velocity,\nno wave will "catch up" to the one in front of it.\nHowever, tension stress waves traveling in one direction\nwill pass through compression stress waves moving in the\nother direction. The additive behavior of these complementary waveforms will give the maximum stress in the\nlocal structure. This behavior is well understood and\nmaximum stresses are easily predicted.\nUnfortunately, the assumption of constant bucket\nvelocity over significant portions of the mass-driver track\nis not reasonable (indeed, it is contrary to the concept of\na linear accelerator). The velocity increases, and the time\nduring which the forces act on the drive coil decreases.\nConsequently, the stress waves propagated by contiguous drive coils will have increasingly shorter periods.\nAn analytical or numerical analysis of the constructive\nor destructive interference of these stress waves is\nbeyond the scope of this study and considerations of\nhow their effects behave along the length of the track\nmust be left for future study.\n\n103\n\nIn summary, calculation of the forces exerted on any\ndrive coil lead to the conclusion that the structural\nmembers joining two drive coils will be subjected to\nboth local tensions and local compressions. Over small\nlengths of the track, bucket velocity may be taken as\nconstant and hence the stress waves propagated by drive\ncoils will be identical. Over these short regions, forces\nacting on the structural members joining adjacent drive\ncoils can be determined. However, a complete analysis of\nthe structural load forces between drive coils must\ninclude changing bucket velocity and the consequent\ninterference patterns caused by nonidentical stress\nwaves. It must be noted that only the first few coil\nsections will be subjected to a net compression since as\none progresses along the MD the intercoil forces shown\nhere are superimposed on the increasing tension,\nT(x) = mBLfRV2ax.\nBucket Structure\nThe mass-driver bucket is subjected to various forces\nwhich must be evaluated in designing the bucket. Considered here are the forces on the bucket coils: the\n"hoop stress" which keeps the coil in tension, the forces\nbetween the two coils, and the stress associated with\nconnecting the payload to the superconducting coil.\nHoop stress- A radial force in the outward direction\nis experienced by any current-carrYing loop. This force is\nequal in magnitude to d energy/dR = (1/2)/(2L/R)\nwhere 1 = current, R = radius, and L = self-inductance of\nthe loop. The force per unit length is then 12 L/41TR 2\nwhich results in a tension on the wire of 12 L/41TR.\nFor a bucket coil with thickness 0.1 D and radius\n0.26D, L = (6128.46XIO- 9 )D (henries). Current is\n2.5X 108 A/m 2 X (0.1 Di and R is 0.26 D, yielding tension as a function of caliber:\n\nbetween them is always 0.26 D/l.II D, dM/dx is a constant 1.3903X 10- 8 . 1 = 2.5X 10 8 A/m 2 X (0.1 D)2, so\nthe force between bucket coils is:\n\nFor a 0.0508-m caliber model, this force is 0.58 N. For a\n0.5-m caliber machine (larger than any currently being\nconsidered) the force would be 5430 N, less than onethird the force of the accelerated payload mass on the\nbottom of the bucket; this force is not a limiting factor\nin bucket design.\nLoad attachment forces- In order to minimize heat\nloss from the superconducting coil, the bucket coils will\nhave to be attached to the payload at the minimum\npossible number of points with the smallest possible\nconnection. The penalty, of course, is in stress on the\ncoils at the attachment points.\nThe sections of the coil between attachment points\nare comparable to curved, double-cantilevered beams\nwhich are being loaded with a uniform force normal to\nthe plane of curvature. Calculations for such beams have\nbeen done and enable us to deduce that, for a coil\nattached at eight evenly spaced points, the transverse\nshear force at the attachment points will be\nwR (0.3927), where w is the loading in force/unit circumferential length of winding, and R is coil radius. For\na coil attached in only four places, the force is\nwR (0.7854).\nSupposing that one coil had to accelerate the\ntotal combined mass of payload and bucket at an\nacceleration a, then F = (Ml + MB)a = W(21TR);\nml = (D/O.l97)3 and mB = 2.263(D/0.197)3, so\nwR = {l/21T)xax 3.263(D/0.197)3. The force on the\nattachment points is then proportional to D3 and to a.\nF= 53.35XD3 X a\n\nfor four attachment points\n\nF = 26.67XD 3 X a\n\nfor eight attachment points\n\nT= 11723.33 D4 (newtons)\n\nThe stress on the loop material is:\na\n\n= TI(D.1\n\nD)2\n\n= 1.172X 106 D2\n\nPa\n\nEven for a large 0.5-m caliber mass driver, the hoop\nstress is 2.93IXlO~ Pa.\nForce between coils- An attractive force will exist\nbetween two coaxial coils carrying current in the same\ndirection. The magnitude of the force is I l / 2 (dM/dx)\nwhere 1 is current and M is mutual inductance. For the\nspecified bucket geometry, in which both bucket coils\nare of equal radii and the ratio of radius to distance\n\n104\n\nThis force will act upon connections which will probably be kept quite cold, and hence brittle, by their\nproximity to the superconducting coil. Attachment that\nwill distribute the transverse force so as to keep stress\nwithin acceptable limits while minimizing mass and heat\nloss is one of the engineering problems of actual bucket\ndeSign. These considerations affect mass driver design\ninsofar as that the stress placed on the coils increases\nproportionally to D. Once the stress limits of the material have been reached, either the proportion of load\nattachment area must be increased with D for large-scale\n\nmass drivers or acceleration must be decreased (held\nconstant with respect to liD).\nA sample calculation: for a OA-m caliber mass driver,\naccelerated at 1000 g\'s by one coil, with four attachment points which distribute the load equally over four\nsections of the coil, each spinning a 10\xc2\xb0 are, the stress on\nthe coil tubing is about 2.31 X 10 7 Pa.\n\nFor Al 2024 T4:\n\nSteel:\n\nFor OPT-4:\nTear Off Point\n1 + mB/ml = 3.263\nWe compute the "tear-off\' point, that is the position\nalong the MDRE where the stress placed on the feeders\nalone requires additional strengthening to sustain the\naxial tension.\nThe tension is\n\nIn figures 6 and 7, x/L is shown as a function of the\nexhaust velocity Ve for various propellant accelerations\nas computed from the OPT-4 formulas.

Therefore, the curved tube-ball stream structure is dynamically neutral, neither straightening itself nor curving\nitself more strongly.\n\nBucket Stream in a Curved Tube\nTo understand the combined effects of the bucket\nstream on the stability of the mass driver we consider\nthe following sample problem.\n\nAdditionally, one can easily show that the total\ndownward force on the section given on 2/Tu\' is exactly\nbalanced by the total upward force exerted by the ball\nstreams on the tube 4p VB2 u\' where u\' is the slope of the\ncurved tube at the ends. Hence, bending the tube does\nnot give a net upward or downward force, which we also\nknow from Newton\'s Third Law.\nAnother way to arrive at the neutral curvature stability is to consider the moment of the tension and centrifugal forces taken about the center of the curved tube at\n\nA.\n106\n\nA\n\nSo\n\nMew = 2mVR\n\ni\n\n8m\n\n.in 8 dO\n\n= 2mVR(1 - cos 8 )\n\nm\n\nSince these are the same there is no net moment\ntending to bend or straighten the tube-ball stream\nstructure.\n\nLarge-Scale Dynamical Stability\n\nThe clockwise moment of the tension force about the\npoint A is:\n\nThe counterclockwise moment of the centrifugal\nforce due to an element of tube ds =Rd8 about the\npoint A.\n\ndue to the two ball streams is\n\ndMcw = R sin 82J1B 0 ds\nR\n\nMass-driver reaction engine structure- The MDRE\nstructure is typically a very long (3-10 km) and at least\nfor the electrical components, quite thin (";;1 m) structure operating in tension. Transverse oscillations will\ntravel very slowly along the structure at velocities of\n~1O-50 m/sec. Typical payload launch rates are 10 Hz\nand are considered high frequencies. We therefore consider the following as a useful limiting mo~el to describe\nthe combined mass-driver bucket stream interaction for\nlarge-scale, low-frequency dynamical motions.\n1. The mass-driver electrical structure (stringers,\nfeeders, drive coils, capacitors, etc.) is averaged over and\nreplaced by a continuously variable mass per unit length.\n2. Because of the extreme length-to-diameter ratios,\nand because we are interested in the basic stability of the\nprimary load-bearing electrical structure-bucket interaction, we ignore any beam bending moments tending to\nstraighten the overall structure. Thus the MDRE is a\nvariable density "rope ," unable to sustain any buckling\nor compressive forces and must remain in tension to be\nstable. For small-scale, high-frequency phenomena such\nas the transverse impulses imparted to separate the payloads and buckets in the peel section, beam bending\nmoments must be included.\n3. The tension forces applied to the "rope" are supplied by the reaction forces of the drive coils accelerating the buckets and payloads. Since the number of\nbuckets between the zero velocity point and any point\ndepends on the position along the MDRE, the tension\nforces are variable depending on position.\n4. The tension forces appearing in the MDRE accelerate the bucket stream. Since the launch rate is large\ncompared to the natural frequencies of interest for the\nlarge-scale dynamical motion, we replace the discrete\nbuckets with a continuum bucket stream variable having\na position-dependent velocity and mass per unit length.\n\n107\n\nThus the problem to be solved in this approximation\nis that of a variable-tension, variable-mass-per-unit-Iength\nrope, which is tensioned by accelerating a variable mass\nper unit length of a varying-velocity fluid "bucket"\nstream attached to the rope.\n\nm\n\nContinuum treatment of bucket flow- If\n= the\nmass flow of buckets and payloads considered as a fluid,\n= pA V, V = bucket velocity, then IlB = Ap = bucket\nand payload density per unit length.\nFor uniformity accelerated motion\n\nm\n\nV(x) = y2ax\n\nm\nm\n\nUsing fR = bucket repetition rate, Hz,\n= mBUR,\nmBL = bucket and payload mass,\n= IlBV, and\n= IlBY2tiX.

This will leave a u" term in equation (I 6), as will\nan initial tension To at x = 0 due to the bucket turn\naround at finite speed either for insertion into the acceleration section or removal from the deceleration leg of\nthe mass driver.\n3. The eigenfrequencies of the acceleration and\ndeceleration sections can be made the same. Since the\nforce exerted on the buckets is the same, in each section,\nthe acceleration ratio is\n(I7)\nThe requirement for wn to be the same in the two\nsections is\n\nmaccel(n + 1/2)1T\n\nwn\n\n=L\n\nmdecel(n + 1/2)1T\n\n= -----~\n\naccel JlT,accel\n\nLdecel JlT,decel\n\nUsing\n\nthen\nLdecel\n\nJlT,accel\n\nmB\n(18)\n\nwhich is the same as equation (17) provided\nJlT,decel = JlT,accel, generally, Jl\xc2\xbb JlB\xc2\xb7\n4. The solutions Wn(x) form an orthogonal set on x\nusing a new variable z = Vx. Thus, given an initial u(x,O)\nand/or u(x ,0) the constants in equation (16) can be\ndetermined using the Fourier sieve. Since the higher\nharmonics are not integral mUltiples of the fundamental,\nthe overall shape of the MORE composed of a summation of the initial eigensolutions will not repeat itself.\nEach normal node has one more node than the preceding\n\n112\n\nVx\n\n5. Since the variable x occurs as\nin the sine or\ncosine, transverse waves are dispersive, the wave speed\ndepending on frequency. For moderate period waves\n(~1-0.1 Hz) the local wave speed can be written as\n\n= 0.3 46 VX\nfor the asteroid MO discussed in reference 5. The wave\nspeed varies from 10.9 m/sec for x = 1 km up to\n34.6 m/sec at x = 10 km.\n6. We conclude from the weakly oscillatory nature of\nthe solutions to the free space MORE electrical\nstructure-bucket interaction that the MORE is stable.\nThe driving term on the right-hand side of equation (9)\nis proportional to the bucket mass flow and hence the\nexternal truss structure will need to be sized in some\nmanner related to the mass flow.\n7. The most important parameter of the external\nstructure is its mass. From a viewpoint of overall efficiency, the external structure should be as light as possible. When this factor is entered into the overall optimizations, it will undoubtedly tend to shorten mass\ndriver length to decrease overall mass. This has not been\ndone at the present time because of ignorance of appropriate structural mass values.\nEven if we do not have figures on structural mass, we\ncan still determine how these masses will scale with\nchanges in total length. Assume that our mass driver\nexternal structure is made from a long chain of identical\nsections, so that the value of EJ does not change over the\nlength. If we change the total length of the mass driver,\nhow must we change EI so that the deflections are\ngeometrically similar?\nWe will assume that the forces acting on our mass\ndriver are gravitational tidal forces, which will increase\nlinearly with the length. This means that the applied\nforces will also be geometrically similar. The basic differential equation describing the deflection is\n\na2 u = applied moment\n\nEI -\n\nax 2\n\nIf we change the length by a factor \xc2\xa32, the applied force\nat a point increases as Q2, and the applied moment\nincreases as \xc2\xa322. Defining\n\n_ 11\n110 - -\n\nso produced to the very long, basically flexible MDRE to\nproduce the desired overall angular acceleration without\nundue bending, constitutes a major yet unsolved structural problem, probably requiring active structural control. Clearly there will be upper limits of the overall\nangular acceleration and bending that will still allow\npassage of the buckets through the guideway without\ntheir scraping the guideway edges.\nWe dynamically represent the MDRE by a long uniform rigid rod with the propellant and payload masses\narranged as shown:\n\n\xc2\xa3 2\nL\n\nT\nc+t.\n\nthen the deflection is described by the non dimensional\nequation\n\nc-t.\n-d\n\nFor a similar deflection, a2Uo/axo 2 must be the same,\nwhich implies that the factor \xc2\xa3L 3 lEI must be constant.\nBut EI increases as , (transverse size of external structure) to the fourth power. Thus for similar deflection\n\n...L\n\n+-----------------L----------------_.\n\nWe let\n\nmD\n\nBut mass and length of the track increase as ,2. This\nimplies that mass and length of the structure will\nincrease as Qtl 6 and total mass as \xc2\xa3 5/16 \xe2\x80\xa2 So total mass\nincreases with increased length not only because a longer\nstructure is needed, but also because this structure must\nbe more solidly built.\nThis model assumes that the major loads applied to\nthe MDRE are gravitational. It may be that they will in\nfact be due to internal mechanic motions (mating of\npellets, etc.). As long as it is known how these forces\nscale with total length, this kind of analysis can be\napplied.

However, when the\nMDRE is operating in orbit about the Earth or Moon the\nnominal shape will deviate from a straight line. This\narises from the fact that the bucket is moving at a\ndifferent orbital velocity from that of the main structure\nof the MDRE. If left to itself the MDRE would tend to\ndeflect downward (in a rotating coordinate frame) when\nVe is such as to give retrograde elliptical orbits for the\nreleased pellets. Thus, the thrust would not be tangential\nfor a straight MORE and additional forces on the guideway would result in the bucket scraping the walls. Therefore, the nominal shape of the MDRE must coincide\nwith the trajectory of the accelerating bucket with the\nadditional constraint that at release the pellet velocity is\ntangential to the orbit.\nThe reference frame used moves in a circular orbit of\nradius r as shown below.\n\nThen\n\nX)2\na =a Y\n\xc2\xb0\n\n~(\n\n~-1/2\n\n+1\n\nY\n\nNow Hill\'s equations become\n\n0)flO)2\n\n~-1/2\n\nX =a (~ L\\~ + ~\n~\n\n0)2\n\nY"=a~~\n\n2\n\n+ 2ny + 3n x\n\n11-1/2\n\n+\n\n~\n\n- 2nx\n\nwith\n\nwhere\n\nK\n\n= GM = gravity parameter of t,he central body\n\nHORIZON _ _ _ _ _ _--::==-_+...:L:.:;O.::.CAL COORDINATE SYSTEM\n\ny\n\nn\n\n= ANGULAR VELOCITY\nABOUT CENTRAL BODY\n\nCENTRAL BODY\n\nHill\'s equations for the motion relative to a coordinate system in uniform circular motion with the x direction along the radial direction are (ref. 3)\n\nTo obtain tl\\e shape of the MDRE as given in figure 9\nthese two equations must be numerically integrated to\nobtain x and y.

The angular frequency, w\nof the flow will be 21T/period, where the period equals\n4Q m/V with Q being the spacing between drive coils\nm\nand V being the bucket velocity. At any moment, there\nwill be four contiguous drive coils having a current flow\nwithin them. Every current will be 30\xc2\xb0 out of phase with\nthat in each of the adjacent drive coils. Figure 2 illustrates the current flows in neighboring coils during the\nactivation of a particular reference drive coil (coil no. 4).\nThe equations describing the current flows with respect\nto that reference drive coil current are as follows:\nCoil no. I\n\n.\n\n(.)\n\n. (\n\n31T)\n\nID = ID max Sln\\wt + 2\n\nCoil no. 7\n\n.\n\n(.)\n\n. (,\n\nID= ID max Sln\\wt-\n\n31T)\n\n2\n\nThe force experienced by any two active coils will be\ngiven by the product of the instantaneous current in\neach coil multiplied by the gradient of their mutual\ninductance (dM/dx) at the distance of their separation:\n\n.. dM\nFab=la1b dx\nThis force will be attractive between coils with currents\nof the same sign, and repulsive between coil currents of\nopposite sign.\nRefer again to figure 1 and consider the forces acting\non the reference coil no. 4. During its first quarter-cycle\n(-1T.s;; wt .s;;-1T/2), coil no.4 will interact repulsively\nwith coil no. 1, repulsively with coil no. 2, and attractively with coil no. 3. At exactly wt = -1T12, a weakly\nfelt coil no. 1 (a distance 3Q m away) will turn off and a\nmuch closer coil (coil no. 5 only a distance Q away)\nm\nwill be activated. Because the force on coil no. 4 due to\ncoil no. 5 is stronger than was the force from coil no. 1,\na discontinuity in the gradient of the force acting on coil\nno. 4 will exist. During the second quarter-cycle\n(-1T12 .s;; wt.s;; 0), coil no.4 will feel a repulsion from\nboth coils nos. 2 and 3, and an attraction to coil no. 5.\nThrough considerations of symmetry, tpe forces exerted\non coil no.4 in the third quarter-cycle are the negative\nof those exerted during the second quarter-cycle. Similarly, forces felt during the fourth quarter-cycle are the\nnegatives of those experienced during the first quartercycle. Over the complete cycle, then, a drive coil receives\nno net force from its neighboring drive coils.\nThe program listed below is designed to calculate the\nreaction force on a drive coil due to all other active drive\ncoils in its neighborhood as a function of the time from\n\n117\n\nwhich that coil was turned on. It is written to be run on\na Hewlett-Packard HP-67/HP-97 calculator.\nIt is assumed that bucket velocity may be taken as\nconstant during the passage of the bucket through any\nfour successive drive coils (a distance of only a few\ncentimeters). Hence, the angular frequency w will be\nconstant.\n\nThe program is initialized by the input of three pieces\nof information: key in the dM/dx between drive coils\nseparated by a distance Qm; ENTER; key in dM/dx at a\ndistance of 2Qm; ENTER; key in dM/dx for a distance of\n3Q m (ref. 4). Initiate the program by pressing the button\nlabeled [K). Program execution will begin. Very\nquickly, the program will pause for a second and the\ndisplay will show "1.0." During this pause, key in the\nmaximum drive coil current. (This value will default to\n1.0 if no entry is made; in this case, all final answers will\nactually be F/iaib.)\nThe program will then loop, displaying a zero for a\nsecond and then blurring for a second. At any instant\nwhen the machine has paused with a zero showing, key\nin a value of wt and the reaction force of the drive coil\nat that instant will be calculated. The program accepts\nvalues of wt expressed in degrees rather than radians.\n0\n0\nThe range of valid values are - 180 ,;;:; wt ,;;:; 180 \xe2\x80\xa2\nOnce a force has been calculated, the answer (in\nNewtons) is displayed for 10 sec. The program then\nbranches to the zero/blur input mode, ready to have the\nnext value of wt keyed in.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. KolIn, H.: Basic Coaxial Mass Driver Reference\nDesign.

SNOW\n\nThis paper is the last of a series of three by the Mass-Driver Group of the 1977 Ames Summer Study. It develops the\nengineering principles required to implement the basic mass-driver design defined in paper I and as presented previously\nin the literature. Optimum component mass trade-offs are derived from a set of four input parameters, and the program\nused to design a lunar launcher. The mass optimization procedure is then incorporated into a more comprehensive mission optimization program called OPT-4, which evaluates an optimized mass-driver reaction engine and its performance\nin a range of specified missions. Finally, this paper discusses, to the extent that time permitted, certain peripheral problems: heating effects in buckets due to magnetic field ripple; an approximate derivation of guide force profiles; the\nmechanics of inserting and releasing payloads; the reaction mass orbits; and a proposed research and development plan\nfor implementing mass drivers. This paper also considers further optimization that depends on advances in component\ntechnology beyond the present state. It is concluded that significant advantage can be gained in the case of small reaction engines with high emission velocity by developing lightweight packaging technology for silicon-controlled rectifiers\n(SCR\'s).\nINTRODUCTION\nThe fundamental physics of electromagnetic mass\ndrivers and the rationale for the basic design that has\nevolved are described by Arnold et al. (ref. 1, and prior\nliterature referred to there). This paper deals primarily\nwith the engineering principles involved in implementing\nthe basic design, and the application of those principles\nto both mass-driver lunar launchers (MDLL) and massdriver reaction engines (MDRE).\nThis embryonic engineering text represents, of\ncourse, a first approach, subject to perhaps as much\nsubsequent refinement as was the engineering work of\nthe Wright brothers or of Professor Goddard. It is rather\nremarkable that precise engineering principles can be\nformulated at all at such an early stage, considering for\ncomparison the amount of work that had to be done in\nthermodynamics, fluid dynamics, applied metallurgy,\n\netc, before the first text on aircraft turbines could be\nwritten_ Mass drivers are unique in that they derive very\ndirectly from the straightforward and well-understood\nprinciples of electromagnetic theory.\nThis paper first develops the formalism for deriving\nthe optimum trade-off among design decisions for a\ngiven set of four input parameters; then certain peripheral problems that appear to be important are considered. Bucket-heating effects, which result from magnetic\nfield ripple, turn out to be entirely manageable, and\nguide force profiles turn out to rise steeply enough to\nprovide reasonable assurance against physical con tact.\nPayload insertion and release do not appear to present\nserious problems, even at the significantly higher launch\nrepetition rates utilized in the present designs. The conditions for safe (i.e., short-lived) reaction mass orbits\nseem clearly definable.\n\n119\n\nCapacitor mass must be higher than previously\nassumed to permit the high repetition rates imposed by\noptimization conditions, that is, maximum use rate conditions. The higher capacitor masses do not appear to\naffect total system mass very significantly.\nSCR mass, on the other hand, represents a crucial\nproblem that requires further research. Presently available SCR\'s involve package masses from 50 to more than\n1000 times heavier than the silicon wafer masses. This\ncircumstance does not reflect a physical necessity, but\nonly the fact that little attention has so far been paid to\nthis problem. From the viewpoint of mass-driver design,\nthe high mass of SCR\'s is unimportant for lunar\nlaunchers and for the large, low-mission-velocity reaction engines intended for use in asteroid retrieval. On the\nother hand, for high-velocity reaction engines, SCR mass\nhas overwhelming effect. It should be possible to take\nadvantage of the extremely short pulse duration and the\nrelatively low pulse repetition rate involved in order to\ndevelop SCR\'s approaching the actual mass of the active\nsilicon wafers.\nAnother important consideration involving SCR\'s,\nabout which very little data are available, is the effect of\nambient operating temperature on their short pulse\nrating. It turns out that the total mass of power supply\nand radiators could be reduced by 32 percent if the\noverall system temperature were permitted to run at\n400 K rather than 300 K. Unfortunately, this optimum\nsystem temperature is so close to the present operating\nlimit of SCR\'s that their pulse rating would be seriously\nreduced. Thus, there are two substantial incentives for\ndevoting some research to the packaging and rating of\nSCR\'s for space applications. It is quite likely that much\ncould be gained by the development of a heat pipe\ncooling system for SCR\'s, for space applications other\nthan mass drivers.\nThe design procedures, optimization programs, and\nexample design results presented here are Conservatively based on existing component technology. They\nare intended to supply a reliable data base for evaluating\nmass-driver performance and usefulness in relation to the\nentire range of possible missions now envisaged.\nOur conclusions justify a serious development effort\naimed toward the implementation of mass drivers. If\nsuch a program is started immediately, following the\nsuggested baseline scenario, an operational mass-driver\nreaction engine could be launched in 1985.\n\n120\n\nMASS-DRIVER DESIGN PRINCIPLES\nInput Parameters\nThe basic electrical and mechanical design of a mass\ndriver is governed by the choice of three mission-related\nvariables and one internal design variable.\nChoice 1- Mass m (kg) and density Pp (kg/m 3 ) of the\ncylindrical propellant lump or payload carried in the\nbucket. Because the volume of the payload has been set,\nml varies only with the density of the material used. For\nall calculations shown here, we have arbitrarily chosen\nPp = 2X 10 3 kg/m 3 , which is somewhat less than the\ndensity of ordinary rock (about 2.5X 10 3 kg/m 3 ).\nChoice 2- Repetition or launching rate of payload\nmasses fR (sec-lor Hz). The product of fR and ml is\nequal to the mass throughput dm/dt = of the mass\ndriver; fR is known once mand ml are chosen. Mass\nthroughput\nis the relevant parameter for determining\nmission performance, but must be separated into f Rand\nml for purposes of design optimization.\nChoice 3- Exhaust or emission or launch velocity ve\n(m/sec) (ve = V max), that is, the velocity with which\nthe payload masses leave the mass driver. The product\nmVe =fRml ve is equal to the thrust of the mass driver\nwhen it is considered as a reaction engine.\nChoice 4- Acceleration a (m/sec 2 ) imparted to the\nloaded bucket by the magnetic drive force. Once the\nconfiguration has been selected, as was done in reference 1, acceleration is simply proportional to the product of bucket and drive coil currents. The bucket current\nis limited by the critical current density of the superconducting material at the magnetic field and temperature\nconditions prevailing, while the drive coil current represents a trade-off, subject to optimization, between component mass (powerplant and radiators, capacitors, and\nSCR\'s). Assuming equal accelerating and decelerating\nforces, the total length of the mass driver (accelerating\nand decelerating sections) is given by the simple relation\n(1 + (mB/mBL)](v/ /2a), where mB is the mass of the\nunloaded bucket and mBL = mB + ml is the mass of the\nloaded bucket. This relation expresses the very reasonable result that. for fixed Pe \xe2\x80\xa2 the greater the acceleration.\nthe shorter the driver.\n\nm\n\nm\n\nDesign Rationale\nThe mass-driver design flow chart given in figure 1\ntraces the logic that leads the designer from his initial\nchoices of ml .fR. ve. and a to the optimized mass-driver\n\nsystem mass and efficiency. In this section, we discuss in\ndetail the logic tree presented in figure 1.\nFUNDAMENTAL\nDESIGN\nCHOICES\n\n<D - m, andpp : MASS AND DENSITY OF PAYLOAD\n@ -\n\n{@\n\no -\n\n} MISSION\n\nf R : REPETITION OR LAUNCH RATE\nV.:\n\nACCELERATION\n\nOnce the caliber is known, the following design\nparameters with dimensions of length can be determined\nfrom the design decisions defined in reference 1:\n\nEXHAUST VELOCITY\n\na:\n\nVARIABLES\n\n113\n\n= 0.l97 ml\n\nI INTERNAL DESIGN VARIABLE\n\n<D\n\nBucket coil width = build:\nWB = 0.1 D = 0.0197 m~/3\nEffective radius of bucket coil:\nr=0.26D=5.l22XI0- 2 mjl3\nLength of single-turn drive winding:\nQ = rrD = 0.619 mjl3\nw\n\nDRIVE WINDING CALIBER\nCOIL SPACING.

Hence the volume\nof the payload is (in MKS units)\n\nMass of a single bucket coil:\nmBC = VpCPs = 0.566 ml since the density of the\nniobium-tin superconductor is 4.53X 10 3 kg/m3\nFrom these results and design choices mentioned\nearlier, we obtain:\nTotal coil mass per bucket:\nmsuper = 2mBC= 1.132 ml\nEmpty bucket mass:\nmB = 2m super = 2.263 ml\nLoaded bucket mass:\nmBL = mB + ml = 3.263 ml\n\nSince ml = vpP p \' the caliber D can be determined;\nassuming Pp = 2X 10 3 kg/m 3 ,\n\nRatio of unloaded to loaded bucket mass:\nmB/mBL = 0.694\n\n121\n\nCurrent in each bucket coil:\n/3\niB = 2.5XI0 6 D2 = 9.702XI0 4\nA based on a\n8\n2\ncurrent density of 2.5X 10 A ni , achieved in the\nM.LT. magneplane model\n\nmi\n\nThe ringing frequency of the drive circuit, wLC, is\nrelated to the velocity of the bucket and the phase\nlength by\n\nSingle-turn self-inductance of a drive coil:\n\nLs\n\n= 2.004X 10-6 D, H\n= 3.948X 10- m~13 , H\n7\n\nNote that the above inductance value was computed\nusing reference 2 (p. 95), assuming the drive coil cross\nsection to have a width and build each equal to 0.05D. If\nwe assume instead a value of O.lD, then we obtain:\nLs = 1.572X 10-6 D = 3.097X 10-7 mt/3 H, equivalent to\nmultiplying by a factor of 0.78. This alternative will be\nreferred to later.\nFrom reference 1, the equivalent circuit for the electrical drive is a series LRC combination in addition to a\nvoltage generator for the back emf due to bucket passage. The actual drive circuit consists of eight drive coils,\nfour per phase, the two phases being in quadrature. It is\nbeyond the scope of this article to analyze this circuit\ncompletely; the interactions between sine-wave currents\nswitched on for single cycles and of differing phases in\nnearby drive coils require a more detailed analysis. For\nthe circuit given in reference 1 the inductance Lw consists of the self\xc2\xb7inductance of a drive coil and the effect\nof all relevant mutual inductances. In the simplified case\nof only one phase operating, Lw = Ls - M 2 , where\nM2 = mutual inductance between drive coils with a spacing of 2\xc2\xa3m.\nFrom choices 2 and 3: Together with the choice of\nml and PP\' the exhaust velocity ve and the repetition\nrate fR determine the following additional mission\nparameters:\nMass throughput:\ndm/dt = lil = fRml\nThrust:\nIhv e = fRml ve\nKinetic energy of payload:\n\n(l/2)mlv/\nJet power or kinetic power:\n\n(l/2)nlVe 2 = (l/2)mdR ve 2\n\n122\n\nAt\n\nt he\n\nmaximum\n\nvelocity end of the driver,\n= 43.1 vem-11I3 \xe2\x80\xa2\nFrom choice 4: The choice of acceleration together\nwith the choice of ml ,JR\' and ve determine the remaining parameters:\n\nwLC = w max and w max\n\nLength of accelerating section:\nSa = ve 2 /2a (assuming equal accelerating and\ndecelerating forces)\nLength of decelerating section:\n\nSd\n\n= (mB/mBL)(ve 2 /2a) = 0.347(ve 2 fa)\n\nTotal length of mass driver:\n\nTotal number of drive windings per phase:\n\nS\n- tot N W- ~ - 11 .62 ve 2 a-I m-113\nl\n\np\nFinally, the drive current iD (in ampere-turns,\niD = n2i) must be calculated. As described in reference 1, the required drive current is obtained from the\nenergy change !1u which each drive coil must impart to\na bucket. However, an approximate method was used\nin this article (not in ref. 1) to determine iD . Given\nthat !1u =\niB(dM/dx)inCx)dx, the expressions for\ndM/dx and iD(x) were approximated by:\ndM/dx = dM/dx(max) sin [(1Tv/2\xc2\xa3m)x]\nand\niD = iD(max)sin[(1Tv/2\xc2\xa3m)x]\' In this approximation,\nthe integral for !1u can be solved in closed form in terms\nof caliber D. Typically this gives an error of less than\n10 percent from the correct value determined by the\nmethod described in reference 1.\nOnce all the design parameters are computed, the\nmasses of the various electrical components, total system\nmass, power requirements, and system efficiency can be\n\nJ\n\ndetermined. The formulas that give the minimized electrical component masses and total system mass were\nderived in the 1976 Ames Study report (ref. 3). These\nformulas have been modified in certain details because\nof the change from a three-phase to a split two-phase\nsystem and the elimination of the "local duty cycle"\n(now unity).

The program derives\noptimized component masses, total mass, overall length,\npower requirements, and waste power, and efficiency on\nthe basis of the four input parameters that have been\ndefined. One essential parameter does not appear explicitly in this program - the caliber. It depends directly on\npayload mass ml and, as explained in reference 1, is\n\nD = 0.197m: /3\nwhere ml is the payload (in kilograms) and D is the\ncaliber (in meters). This relationship is based on our\nassumed payload density of 2X 10 3 kg/m 3 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe program was used to compute an optimized lunar\nlauncher. Requirements were specified as an annual\nthroughput of 650,000 metric tons, assuming 49 percent\noperating time - which allows for total shutdown during\nthe lunar night and I-percent downtime for emergency\nrepairs. This requires a 42-kg/sec throughput. At a given\nthroughput, the total system mass is found to be quite\ninsensitive to variations in launch frequency and payload\n\nmass, within practical limits. We have therefore arbitrarily chosen payload mass and launch frequency as\n10.5 kg and 4 Hz, respectively. The launch velocity is\n2,400 m/sec, the lunar escape velocity. Acceleration is\nchosen as 1000 Earth gravities or 10,000 m/sec 2 . The\nfollowing optimized parameters are obtained:\nSCR mass\nWinding mass\nFeeder mass\nKinetic power mass\nTotal electric mass\nTotal mass\nTotal length\nWaste power\nTotal power\nEfficiency\n\n5.03X104 kg\n1.08X 10 5 kg\n4.33X 104 kg\n1.69X 10 6 kg\n2.09X 106 kg\n3.13X 10 6 kg\n4.88X 10 2 m\n4.46X 10 6 W\n1.25X 10 8 W\n96.4 percent\n\nNote that if the acceleration is decreased by a factor\nof 10 to 100 gravities or 1000 m/sec 2 , there will be\na 4-percent savings in total mass, the efficiency will\nrise slightly to 97 percent, but the total length of\nthe launcher increases by a factor of 10 to nearly 5 km.\nThe caliber of the assumed launcher is\nD = 0.197m1 /3 = 0.431 m (17 in.).\nThe program can also be used to optimize the mass of\nmass drivers used as reaction engines, subject to the\nslight change in assumed boundary conditions as indicated in the program description (appendix A). However, mass-driver reaction engines must be optimized in\nterms of overall mission requirements and, therefore, the\ninput parameters that form the basis for the present\noptimization no longer represent the independent variables. A more fundamental mission optimization program will therefore be developed in the following\nsection_\n\nMISSION OPTIMIZATION\nIn the preceding section, we solved the problem of\ndesigning an optimized mass driver, that is, one of minimum total mass, on the basis of four input parameters:\npayload mass and density, launch repetition rate (which\ntogether determine mass throughput and required size),\nexhaust velocity, and acceleration. This optimization\nprogram is adequate for the design of lunar launchers,\nbut a more comprehensive optimization process is\nrequired to design the optimized mass-driver reaction\nengine for a given mission in space. We have developed\nsuch a comprehensive mission optimization program,\ncalled OPT-4. The rationale of this procedure is\n\ndescribed here and a number of selected mission performance curves are presented. An HP 67/97 version of the\nOPT-4 program is described in appendix B.\nEquivalent Free\xc2\xb7Space Velocity Increment\nA space mission is characterized predominantly by its\nvelocity increment, which is defined as\n\nLl V =\n\nrtB\nJo a(t)dt\n\n(I)\n\nwhere aCt) is acceleration as a function of time and tB is\nthe total thrusting time. This parameter can be defined\nfor motion in an inverse-square gravitational field in the\nlimit of low-thrust spiral orbits typical of mass-driver\nperformance as follows.\nWe assume the velocity to be equal to the local\ncircular velocity at all times. The total energy per unit\nmass, kinetic plus gravitational, is\n\nE= 0_ ~\n2 r\n\n(2)\n\nwhere K = GMprimary and r is the orbit radius.\n\nv/\n\nThe local circular velocity in an orbit is\n= K/r\n(orbit condition) and, since v = vC\' E=-K/2r. The rate\nof change of energy per unit mass, that is, the power per\nunit mass, is\n\ndE K dr\n--dt 2r2 dt\nIf a = force per unit mass = acceleration, then the power\nsupplied per unit mass is a . jj = dE/dt. Assuming jj parallel to a (tangential thrust) and v2 = K/r, we find:\n\nt!!. = 2ar 312\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nK1I2\n\nas the radial velocity due to the tangential acceleration.\nSeparating variables, we obtain:\n\nrt a dt = Vf- irordr\n2\nr\n\nJ~\no\n\n3/2\n\nand\n\n125\n\nThus, the equivalent free-space 6 V for low thrust spiraling in an inverse-square-law field is the difference in\ncircular velocities for the initial and final orbits. This\nanalysis does not apply for plane-changing or highly\nelliptical orbits.\nAnother quantity of interest is the relation between\n6V, the initial acceleration ao\' and the exhaust velocity\nve. Let M(t) be the overall mass of the vehicle and T be\nthe thrust force, then aCt)\nT/M(t), where\nM(t) = Mo - rilt and Mo is the initial mass.

The drive windings have\na mean diameter (caliber) of 5 cm, with a nominal peak\ndrive current of 15,000 A-turns, corresponding to an\nacceleration of 1000 gravities. For single-turn drive and\nbucket windings, the mutual inductance is 0.015-pH\npeak and the bucket coil inductance is 0,03 pH.\nAn upper limit to bucket heating is the case of the\nbucket coil anchored in position in the plane of the drive\ncoil, which corresponds to the "locked rotor" case of an\nelectric motor. At the ve end of the mass driver, the\ndrive frequency is 2.5XlO s Hz, for ve = 104 m/sec and a\nwavelength of 4 cm (two-pha~e bipolar drive with a I-cm\nspacing between drive coils), We assume that each\nbucket coil is surrounded by thermal radiation shields\nand an outermost unbroken aluminum jacket serving as\neddy current shield. To satisfy electromagnetic principles, the current flowing in the current shield must\ncancel any flux change induced by the drive coils. The\ncorresponding condition is\n\ndiD\ndiB\nM-+L-=O\ndt\ndt\n104\nVa,mls\n\n(b) a = 5,000 m/sec 2 ,\n\nFigure 13.- Concluded.\n\nHEATING EFFECTS IN BUCKET\nLosses due to the drag component of the magneticflight guidance forces occur in the guideway conductors\nrather than in the moving bucket, and so are not considered in this section, As the bucket accelerates, however,\nit is acted on by fields that vary with time, as seen in the\ncoordinate system of the bucket. These time-varying\nfields cause induced currents within the bucket and\ncorresponding losses. We now compute those losses to\ndetermine whether they will cause an unacceptable heat\ninput.\nThere is a question, not investigated here, whether\nthe superconducting windings must be protected from\ntime-varying fields. The fields of the drive coils are not\nvery strong, typically about 500 G (0.05 T), and the\ntime variation in the bucket frame is only a small fraction of the amplitude. Although no protection is likely\nto be required, we take the precaution of providing an\n\n138\n\nwhere iD is the drive coil current, iB is the bucket coil\ncurrent, and t is time. The corresponding current in the\ncurrent shield would be 7200 A, which is intolerably\nhigh, as might be expected in the locked rotor case.\nThe realistic situation is a bucket moving along the\naccelerator, triggering the drive coils at the correct times\nas it advances. If the drive coils were distributed uniformly, corresponding to an infinite number of phases,\nthe bucket coil would ride a moving wave of nonvarying\nmagnetic field in the manner of a surfboard and would\nexperience no change in flux linkage. In the real case,\nthere is some variation due to the ripple in the drive\nsystem. We recall that, for 60 Hz, the ripple frequency is\n120 Hz for single phase or 360 Hz for three phase.\nCorrespondingly, the ripple frequency is four times the\ndrive frequency in the two-phase case. It suffices to\n0\ncalculate the current over 180 of phase at this ripple\nfrequency, half the distance between drive coils. We\nverify that statement by noting that all drive coils act\nidentically, and that their action is symmetrical forward\nand backward, so that the longest unrepeating distance\nalong the machine must be half the distance between\ncoils.\nWe have used the curve for dM/dx to calculate the\nenergy change imparted to each bucket coil by passage\n\nthrough each drive coil. To calculate the ripple, we need\nthe curve for M itself (fig. 14) to obtain the change in\nflux linkage in the absence of current in the current\nshield.\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\nover all coils whose currents are nonzero. Table 1 summarizes the calculation. As expected, the ripple frequency corresponds to a wavelength equal to the drive\ncoil spacing. The peak current is 1/58 of the drive\ncurrent and must be carried by the shield in order that\nthe superconducting coil experience no flux linkage.\n\n.005\n\no\n\n4\n\n5\n\nx, em\n\nFigure 14.- Mutual inductance between drive and\n\nbucket coils vs bucket position for 5-cm caliber\nMDRE, for calculation of field ripple in bucket frame\nof reference.\nWe carry out the bookkeeping of drive currents by\nuse of figure 15, where the current in each drive coil is\nrepresented by the projection onto the y axis of a vector\nof length id rotating at the drive frequency. The vector\nswitches on when = 0\xc2\xb0 (positive horizontal axis), when\nthe bucket coil is two coil spacings (half a wavelength)\nfrom the drive coil. The vector goes through a complete\n360\xc2\xb0 change of direction in the mathematically positive\n\ne\n\n--0-\n\nsense (counterclockwise) and switches off after that one\nrotation when the bucket coil is a half wavelength on the\nopposite side of the drive coil.

For aluminum, 0 = 8.5XlO- s m. The resistance of\na solid shield would be excessive, so the shield must be\nin Litz wire form. In that case, if we devote 1 g of\naluminum to each of the two current shields in the\nbucket, the average power in each shield during acceleration will be 18 W for a shield major diameter of 2.6 cm.\nFor a track 10 km long, the acceleration time is 2 sec,\nand the heat rise is 40\xc2\xb0 C, which is quite tolerable.\nDuring the long, slow return, the shield will have time to\ncool back to room temperature if it is left free to radiate\nto the cold of space.\nWe conclude therefore that no serious heating effects\nwill occur in the bucket as a result of induced currents\nor fields during acceleration so long as accelerations are\nof the order of 1000 gravities. At higher accelerations, in\nthe range of several thousand gravities, such effects\nmight become more serious and might require the use of\na larger number of phases, that is, more closely spaced\ndrive coils.\n\n11.25\xc2\xb0\n\n*\n\n~\n\nThe skin depth 0 in the shield is 0 =.../2plwp., where\nw is the ripple frequency (for 10 6 Hz) and p, the resis-\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 15.- Vector representation of drive cu"ent in\n\nsix drive coils at different values of the phase angle.\n\nGUIDE FORCE PROFILES\nIn reference 1, the guidance or restoring force on the\nbucket was calculated for small displacement from the\nequilibrium trajectory to determine the resonant frequency of transverse oscillations and its scaling with\ncaliber.\nAn equally important consideration is whether the\nrestoring force profile for large displacement from equilibrium rises steeply enough to prevent physical contact\nbetween the bucket and the guideway surface.

Because of the\nphysical size of the superconducting coil and the surrounding thermal radiation shield and eddy current\nshield, contact occurs before the current t1lament\nreaches the guideway. The strength of the repulsion\nforce at contact, or the shape of the restoring force\nprofile, represents the ultimate lower limit on the caliber\nof mass drivers. Ultimately, it will have to be computed\nexactly or determined by inductance simulation methods. At present, however, we shall calculate the restoring\nforce profile from the octagonal approximation and\nexamine its implication for the two design examples\npresented earlier: the optimized lunar launcher and the\n5-cm caliber reaction engine.\nThe octagonal approximation is defined in figure 16.\nThe approach is a fair approximation of reality hecause\nthe guideway will consist of several narrow aluminum\nstrips, possibly eight, located inside the drive coils. These\nstrips might occupy 1/4 to 1/2 the circumference. The\nrestoring force profile must then be scaled accordingly\nfrom our calculation, which assumes complete envelopment.

The limitation\nmight be quite stringent in the 5-cm caliber case, but will\ndepend on the dynamics of the interaction since the\nguideway is far from rigid.\n\nPAYLOAD MANIPULATION\nThe manipulation of buckets and payloads has been\nstudied only to the extent necessary to ascertain that no\nfundamental problems arise, and that the repetition rate\nof 10 launches/sec is a conservative choice.\n\n141\n\nLoading and Feeding\nFor the optimized lunar launcher, buckets that are\n0.478 m long will enter the mass driver at the rate of\n10/sec. This represents a bumper-to-bumper procession\nmoving at 4.78 m/sec or 10.7 mph, which is bicycle\nspeed, or the speed of many assembly lines.\nFor the reference reaction engine design, buckets that\nare 0.056 m long, launched at the rate of I O/sec, would\nenter the mass driver at 0.56 m/sec, which is 1.24 mph, a\nleisurely walk.\nIndividual buckets would be taken out of circulation\nat intervals of perhaps I hr for recooling and readjustment of the superconducting current. The payload could\nbe introduced in the form of a powder or liquid (liquid\noxygen) while the buckets are accelerated to feeding\nspeed, and in tlus case no special containers would be\nrequired. Alternatively, the payload might be compacted\ninto a cylindrical pouch having adequate tensile strength,\nor held in a surrounding structure capable of withstanding the hydrodynamic bursting force under acceleration.\nLoading and feeding do not appear to involve any\nfundamental problems.\n\nThe maximum available deflection force F was calculated in the preceding section.\nFor the lunar launcher,\n\nml\nD\n\n= 10.5 kg\n= 0.431\n\nm\n\nv = 2.4 km/sec\nF= 0.5X10 5 N\nThe def1ection path is found to be z = 4.86 m, compared\nto the headway distance from the following payload of\n240 m - clearly a safe separation.\nFor the reaction engine,\n\nml = 0.0164 kg\nD = 0.05 m\nv=10km/sec\n\nF= 2.9 N\nRelease and Def1ection\nAs the stream of buckets enters the launcher, their\n\nseparation increases continuously until the launch point\nis reached. We must ascertain that the empty bucket can\nbe deflected with sufficient lateral acceleration by the\navailable guidance forces to ensure that it will not be\nstruck by the next payload to be launched.\nAssuming that the empty bucket is deflected with a\nradi us of curvature R, then the distance of travel\nrequired to reach a deflection d is given approximately\nby\n\nWe assume that the deflection required to clear the next\npayload is about equal to the caliber D. The centrifugal\nforce F is related to the radius of curvature R by\n\nmv 2\n\nF=R\n\nor\n\nmv 2\nR=F\n\nthe empty bucket mass mE = 2.263 ml, the payload\nmass. Therefore, the travel distance required to achieve a\ndeflection D is given by\nZ\n\n142\n\n=V2RD = vV4.5mD/F\n\nThe separation path is found to be 358 m, compared to\na headway of 1000 m, still as safe a separation as prevails\non most freeways. In both cases, the available lateral\nforce is based on the assumption of a half-enclosing\nguideway structure.\nIt is clear that, with reaction engines, deflecting the\nempty bucket at high speed will apply a lateral force to\nthe launch end of the mass driver which may produce\nunacceptable effects. To avoid this situation, it would be\nsimple to split the payload longitudinally and separate\nthe two halves laterally by means of a relatively gentle\nspring pressure, while the empty bucket is decelerated\ndrastically before being deflected for the slow return\ntravel. It thus appears that no serious problem is\ninvolved in the launching operation.\n\nREACTION MASS ORBITS\nThe reaction mass ejected by a mass-driver reaction\nengine (MDRE) may be rendered harmless if it consists\nof liquid oxygen or a loose aggregate of fine powder. If\nit is a solid pe lIet, however, it poses a hazard to other\nspacecraft as well as to itself. We shall therefore examine\nthe conditions that must be satisfied to ensure that the\norbit of the ejected reaction mass is short-lived. The\n\nmass-driver reaction engine considered here is thrusting\ntangentially to the orbit as it spirals inward or outward\nfrom the central body. The nominal trajectory of the\nMORE at an instant is a circular orbit.\nWhen departing from low orbit about the central\nbody, the exhaust velocity is opposite that of the circular orbit velocity. This allows for retrograde orbits with\nrespect to the orbiting MORE when ve > vc \' where ve is\nthe exhaust velocity and Vc is the circular orbit velocity.\nWhen ve < vc \' the orbits are posigrade.\nFor the pellets to go into a retrograde parabolic\nescape trajectory,\n\nIn figures 18 to 21, the following values are used:\nEarth:\n\nR = 6378 km\n\nLEO = 200 km altitude\n\nMoon:\n\nwhere K = GM = gravity constant of the central body\nand r is the orbit radius. When ve >YK7Y(.j2+ 1), the\npellets will travel hyperbolic escape trajectories.\nThe cases where the periapsis is equal to the radius of\nthe central body and the orbit radius is equal to the\napoapsis radius constitute the boundaries for central\nbody intersecting trajectories:\nRetrograde limit: ve\n\n=.JKiY [1 + ..j2R/(R + r))\n\nR\n\n= 1738 km\n\nLLO = 100 km altitude\n\nThe two figures for arrival trajectories for the MORE\nshow the limit for parabolic escape only since ve is in the\nsame direction as vc:\n\nPosigrade limit: ve = ..jKjr (1- ..j2R/(R + r)]\nwhere R is the radius of the central body. When\nVe\n\n< $Tr [1 -\n\n35\n\n..j2R!(R + r)]\n\nthe pellets will go into elliptical orbits that will not\ndecay for periods ranging from days to many years.

When\n\nvKTr [I - y2R!(R + r)] < Ve < YKjr [1 + y2R/(R + r)]\nthe orbits are either posigrade or retrograde, but they all\nintersect the central body during the first orbit.

Approximating the temperature of space\nshaded from the Sun as 0\xc2\xb0 and using the fact that the\nApollo radiators, which operated at 300 K, weighed\n0.02 kg/W, the mass of the radiators is found to be\n\nmR = 0.02 (300)4 (l/Tt (kg/W)\nIt is possible that slightly lighter radiators might be\ndesigned for the mass driver since these will not have to\nfunction at the low temperature which forced the\nApollo designers to use special materials with unusual\nthermal properties; however, the above figure is the one\nused in all calculations.\n\nOptimized System Temperature\nThe operating temperature of the mass driver has\nbeen arbitrarily assumed in all previous calculations to\nbe about room temperature, that is, 300 K. Since radiator mass varies significantly with temperature and represents a considerable fraction of the total mass, it must be\nconsidered whether a significant reduction in optimized\ntotal system mass might be attained by allowing the\noperating temperature of the radiators to rise. This could\nbe accomplished either by running the entire circuit at a\nhigher temperature or by using heat pumps to maintain a\nhigher radiator temperature while operating the electrical circuitry at a lower temperature.\nTo do this, one must examine the dependence of\nmass on temperature. Both powerplant and radiator\nmass vary with temperature, powerplant mass being\ndirectly proportional to the power dissipated in the\ncircuit ([2 R, where [ is current and R is resistance).\nRadiator mass, from basic thermodynamics, is inversely\n\nwhere\nspecific powerplant mass; 0.005 kg/W for MDRE\'s\nand 0.014 kg/W for MDLL\'s\n\nmR\n\nradiator mass; 0.02(300/n 4 (kg/W)\n\nR\n\nresistance, proportional to resistivity\np = 2.81XI0- 8 (1.0041)T-300 (for aluminum)\n\nI\n\ncurrent\n\nand Rand mR are functions of T.

The mass\nsavings with increasing temperature are at first substantial, but taper off, with overall mass beginning to level\noff at about 400 K and reaching an optimum at about\n440K.\nlimitations are imposed on the system by the SCR\'s,\nwhich at the present level of technology cannot be\noperated above 400 K. Were the radiators to be operated\nabove this temperature, therefore, heat pumps would\nhave to be used between radiators and SCR\'s. Since the\nmass savings on radiators and power plant become minimal above 400 K (only 3 percent of combined radiator\n\n...\n\n;: 14\n><\n\n!li 12\n\xc2\xab\n::;;\n0::\n\n~10\n\no\n\xc2\xab\n0::\nC\nZ\n\n8\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n!Z\n\n\xc2\xab\n..J\n\n6\n\n0-\n\n0::\n\nw 4\n\n~\n~\n\nc::;\n\n2\n\nW\n\n0-\n\n~ ~OO~~25~O~~30~O~~3~50~~4~OO~-4~5~O~5~O~O--~--~--=\nSYSTEM TEMPERATURE.

Mass-driver design in\nthe future should be based on the assumption that the\nsystem will be run at the highest temperature possible\nfor the circuit components. At present, this appears to\nbe about 400 K.\nHowever, the surge rating of SCR\'s decreases with\nrising temperature and becomes very low at the operating limit of 400 K; no performance data are available in\nthis region. There is clearly a need for research in the\nadaptation of SCR teclUlology to space requirements\n(see SCR section).\n\nCapacitor Technology\nSpecific capacitor mass has been assumed to be\n8XlO- 3 kg/J (or 56.7 J/lb in customary trade units).\nThis is a conservative rating for energy storage capacitors\nof the "high energy density" class.\nWe have never examined, however, whether such\ncapacitors will withstand the act ual operating conditions\nresulting from optimized sector length, and achieve the\nrequired service life of about 10 10 discharge cycles. It\nappears that they will not, and that two alternative\nsolutions to the capacitor problem must be compared:\n1. Use of capacitors designed for continuous ac duty\n(powerline capacitors) at the discharge rate and average\npower flow resulting from optimized sector length, that\nis, optimized capacitor utilization.\n2. Use of high energy density energy storage capacitors, but limiting the sector length to remain below the\nmaximum discharge rate permissible under the particular\noperating conditions.\nThe previous optimizations lead to the following conditions: in a 5-cm caliber orbital transfer driver operating\nat a = 5000 m/sec 2 , ve = 8000 m/sec, launch\nrate = 5 Hz:\nCapacitor mass = feeder mass = associated power and\nradiator mass = 4 percent of total driver mass, or\n12 percent altogether\nSector length = 1.25 m, with 40 coils on each capacitor, discharge rate = 800/sec, ringing frequency =\n1.95XIO s , duty cycle = 4.1XIO- 3\n\n146\n\nIn a 17 -cm caliber asteroid retriever operating at\n\na\n\n= 1000 m/sec 2 , ve = 2400 m/sec, launch rate = 14 Hz:\nCapacitor mass = feeder mass = associated power and\nradiator mass = 10 percent of total driver mass, or\n30 percent altogether\nSector length = 1.4 m, with 15 coils on each capacitor, discharge rate = 412/sec, ringing frequency =\n2.6X 10 3 , duty cycle = 0.156\n\nAn increase in specific capacitor mass would increase\nthe optimum sector length, resulting in even more coils\nconnected to each feeder capacitor, with a corresponding increase in discharge rate. It therefore becomes\nimportant to consider in some detail the performance\ncapability of energy storage capacitors.\nThe Air Force Propulsion Laboratory, Wright\xc2\xb7\nPatterson Air Force Base, Ohio, has already sponsored a\nserious investigation of high-density energy storage\ncapacitors by two leading manufacturers (refs. 5,6). A\nthird source of information is Tobe Deutschman laboratories, Inc. (Canton, Mass.), a small but very innovative\nmanufacturer, and the first to have developed energy\nstorage capacitors for high-voltage, high-rate service\n(T. Deutschman, Jr., personal communication, 1977; he\nconsiders the Maxwell report to be solidly based on\nexperiment, but the TRW report to contain somewhat\nexcessive extrapolations beyond actual testing).\nThe tests in question were made using 0.00017\xc2\xb7in.\xc2\xb7\nthick aluminum foil, separated by four types of\ndielectric:\nPolyester 111m (Mylar, Scotchpar)\nPolypropylene 111m\nPolyvinylidine fluoride (KF polymer)\nKraft paper with castor oil\nand immersed in four types of oil:\nPolychlorinated polyphenyls\nAromatic hydrocarbons\nEster\nSilicon oils\nRepetition rates up to 250/sec were tried where possible, but in most cases burst rates had to be severely\nlimited to prevent excessive temperature rise. The maximum hot-spot temperature permitted was 65\xc2\xb0 C. Test\nvoltages to 12 kY were used. Duty cycles ranged from\n0.1 to 0.004. Reversal voltages of 0 to 31 percent were\nused. Test units were individual pads, I in. in diameter\nand 6 in. long, and completely packaged 500-J units.\nlife expectancy was only 105 discharge cycles, which\nsatisfied Air Force requirements.\n\nResults indicate that the dominant failure mode was\ndielectric puncture at foil edge, and that voltage reversal\n\nhas dramatic effect on life, which varies about with the\npower of -1.83 of the fractional voltage reversal. A\ncurve taken from reference 6 summarizes life as a function of specific mass (fig. 23).\nMYLAR-PAPER/A\n\n108\nK FILM-PAPER/CO\n\n:l\n\no\n\n~\n\nw\xc2\xb7\n\nPOLYPROPYLENE\nPAPER/A\n\nLL\n\n:::;\n\nWestinghouse unit has a specific mass of 2 1/lb. Maxwell\nLaboratories estimate that 400-Hz line frequency units\nmight have a mass of about 1 1 /Ib, which is 50 times the\nassumed specific mass.\nNote, as indicated in reference 6, that no capacitor\nmanufactured to date has come close to performing to\nthe limits of the material used. Failure is always associated with manufacturing defects.\nFinally, we should consider the use of vacuum capacitors. For mass-driver service, they have the advantage of\nvery long life expectancy and frequency tolerance, and\nthey would have a specific mass no greater than that of\npowerline capacitors if one assumes that O.OOI-in.-thick\naluminum foil can be made to support itself. The bulk of\nsuch capacitors has always precluded their use on Earth,\nbut they should be investigated in connection with space\nrequirements in general.\nIt might also be expedient at some point to consider\nthe possibility of using the back surface of solar panels\nas capacitor area.\nSCR Teclmology\n\nA- AROCLOR\nCO - CASTOR 01 L\n\n103L-____~______~__~~L_L__ _~~_ _ _ _~\n10\n20\n40\n60\n80 100\n200\n400\nJOULES/lb\n\nFigure 23.- Pad life vs energy density for commercial\nenergy storage capacitors (from ref. 3 J.\nMaxwell Laboratories (W. White, personal communication, 1977) is now undertaking a new investigation for\nWright-Patterson AFB to cover high discharge rates (to\n500 pps) and longer lifetimes (to 10 9 cycles). They also\nreport having built (for Avco-Everett Laboratory) one\nunit that approaches our requirements and that also\nprovides a tested value of specific mass: a laser optical\npumping unit for laser propulsion studies. The specifications are:\n50-Hz discharge rate, continuous\n25-kV operating voltage, 50-1 unit\n10 9 pulse life expectancy\nSpecific mass: 5 1/lb\nThis represents 10 times the specific mass assumed previously (57 1 /Ib).\nNote that this specific mass approaches that value\ntypical of commercial power factor correction capacitors, rated for continuous duty at 60 Hz, with\n100-percent voltage reversal. A currently available\n\nMass-driver optimizations to date have been based on\na "nonrepetitive peak pulse rating" leading to a typical\nspecific mass of 5X 10 -9 kg/VA peak. They represent\nabout 1/3 the total mass of the 5-cm caliber interorbital\nreaction engine (operating at an acceleration of\n5000 m/sec 2 , a launch velocity of 8000 m/sec, a payload\nof 0.014 kg, and a launch rate of 5 Hz). SCR mass\nrepresents a smaller fraction of the IS-cm caliber\nasteroid-retrieval engine operating at a launch rate of\n14 Hz. However, since individual SCR\'s now fire at a\nrate of 2S pulses/sec (two bucket coils), their duty cycle\nbegins to approach powerline service conditions and\ncontinuous duty ratings must be considered. This suggests a thorough examination of the state of power\nsemiconductor technology.\nThe functional element of power rectifiers, transistors, and thyristors is a silicon pellet or wafer about\nO.OOS to 0.020 in. thick, ranging in size from 1.7 in.\n(44 mm) to 2.S in. (70 mm) in diameter, with 3-in.\n(76-mm) and 4-in. (l02-mm) pellets, presently under\ndevelopment (D. L. Schaefer, unpublished General Electric report, 1977). The packaging of these elements\nrepresents General Electric\'s primary research priority at\nthe present since it has never received sophisticated\nattention. Not only does the package mass completely\novershadow the functional element mass, but it also\nincreases disproportionately with increasing size. For\nexample, a 33-mm-diameter pellet has a mass of 0.75 g\n\n147\n\nand a package of 200 g (factor 267); a 102-mm pellet\nhas a mass of 2.3 g and a package of 3.1 kg\n(factor 1348). The only incentive for making larger\ndevices is to eliminate the difficulty of connecting many\nsmall ones in series or parallel.\nFigure 24 summarizes the specific mass of presently\navailable "Press Pak" or "Hockey-Puck" devices,\nintended to be clamped between heat sinks at bolting\nforces ranging from several hundred to several thousand\npounds (bolts not included in package weight). Note\nthat these ratin~s are based on 1000-V standoff, but that\nIO,OOO-V ratings would not increase the mass substantially; specific mass values can therefore safely be\ndivided by a factor of to.\n"-\n\n2.0 x 10-7\n28mm\n\n2.5\n\n5.0 x 107\n\n10.0 \' - - - - - - - \' - - - - - - - - \' - - - - - - - - " O l t t t 1 + f t t f f i\n20\n40\nPELLET DIAMETER, mm\n\nFigure 24.- Specific mass of packaged, commercial\nSeR\'s vs pellet diameter, for 1000- V rating and\naverage power shown in VA (information supplied\nby General Electric - see tex t).\nThe maximum safe operating temperature of the sili:\n0\n0\ncon pellets is 125 to 150 C (398 to 423 K). As mentioned in the section on optimized system temperature,\nthis limits the temperature of the feeder lines to which\nthe SCR\'s must be connected.\nThe inordinate packaging mass of power semiconductors represents a crude solution to two basic problems:\n(i) making good electrical and thermal contact with the\n\n148\n\npellet surface despite a difference in thermal expansion\ncoefficient by a factor of 7 to 10 (silicon to copper or\naluminum) and (2) preventing voltage breakdown or\nleakage currents at the edge of the very thin pellets.\nThe contact problem is solved by diffusion bonding\nthe silicon wafer to a massive tungsten or molybdenum\npad of low thermal expansion (within a factor of 2\nrelative to silicon), typically 10 times thicker than the\nwafer, and then clamping this bonded sandwich between\ncopper electrodes with maximum possible pressure. The\ndry contact thus achieved is still poor, both electrically\nand thermally. It is likely that a considerable fraction of\nthe heat to be removed is generated not in the wafer\nbody, but ironically at the contact surface.\nThe voltage problem is solved by coating the lateral\nwafer surfaces with silicone compounds and encapsulating the wafer hermetically. In certain exceptional applications (high-energy physics) involving high standoff\nvoltages, the wafers have been immersed in Dow-Corning\nsilicone transformer oil No. 704, one of the few liquids\nfound to be compatible with silicon on the long run.\nIt is clear that a significant mass savings can be\nrealized by finding a more elegant solution to both\nproblems. The subject deserves serious attention, considering the increasing need for power semiconductor\ndevices in space, as well as in airborne terrestrial\napplications.\nFor mass drivers, it seems logical to consider the\npossibility of designing the entire feeder structure as a\nheat pipe, using the aluminum litz wire filaments as a\npossible wick material. The silicon wafers could then be\nimmersed directly in the heat pipe fluid. Instead of dry\ncontact, it seems logical to use a graded bond involving\nseveral metals of progressively increasing expansion coefficient in order to distribute the inevitable strain over\nseveral bonded interfaces with provisions for direct heat\nremoval by immersed fins.\nIt seems reasonable, for the present purposes, to use a\nspecific SCR mass of 10 -7 kg/V A average duty; this\nrepresents 1/10 of the worst case (largest) 1000-V device\nincluded in figure 24.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN\nBaseline Scenario\nNo engineering study is complete without some\nassessment of the cost and time required for implementation. We have attempted to make such an assessment\non a conservative basis. We define a "baseline scenario"\n\nas an all-out effort based on a national commitment. If\nthis effort is started immediately, using the body of\nknowledge and expertise developed to date, a lunar mass\ndriver could begin operating in 1985. The proposed\nbaseline schedule is shown in figure 25.\n78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87\nRESEARCH AND\nTECHNOLOGY\nLUNAR ORBITAL SURVEY\nMORE FLIGHT\nDEMONSTRATION\nLUNAR LANDER SURVEY\nLUNAR MD No. 1\nMORE No.1\n\nv\n\nv\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n16\n150\n\n1 I J\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI 1\n\n36\n500\n\nI\nI J\n\n1480\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nMORE No.2\nMORE No.3\n\nII\n\n1\n\n1\n\n465\n300\n\nJ\n\n165\n$ MILLION\n\nFigure 25.- Mass-driver development schedule according\nto baseline scenario.\nThe program begins with a series of technology\nstudies to define critical development areas and select\ncertain parameters and techniques for the initial design.\nThese studies include the design and demonstration of\ntwo working models of a mass driver, indicated by\ntriangles. The first of these, a 500-g linear superconducting system that is 10m long, is to be constructed by\nPrinceton and M.LT. in 1978-79. The second model\nwould be a prototype interorbital transfer reaction\nengine of 5-cm caliber operating in a vacuum tunnel. The\nrelated research program is outlined in the following\nsection.\nConcurrently, potential installation sites would be\nsurveyed from lunar orbit and eventually explored by a\nmanned or unmanned lander. An excellent review of this\nsubject, as well as the mass catching problem, was published recently by Heppenheimer (ref. 7).\nThe first flight demonstration of a MDRE in LEO\nmight occur in late 1981. Development would continue,\nculminating in the first operational reaction engine in\nmid-1985. This reaction engine might serve to transport\nthe first parts of the lunar launcher, which would be\nready to begin installation at about that time. Second\nand third reaction engines would become operational in\n1986 and 1987.\nResearch and Technology Studies\nThe research and technology studies necessary for the\ndevelopment of operational mass-driver systems have\n\nbeen broken down rather arbitrarily into six broad\ncategories:\nBasic research and technology\n$10 million\n1. Mechanical analysis and design\n$7 million\nPayload loading on LL\nPayload release from LL\nPayload attachment to MDRE\nReaction mass handling on MDRE\nReaction mass sanitization\nBucket recirculation\nLunar installation design\nAssembly techniques in space\n2.

Component improvements\n$6 million\nPower supplies\nCapacitors: dielectric, vacuum\nSCR\'s: alternative packaging and cooling\nSuperconductors: mechanical and electrical\ncontainment\nRadiators and heat pipes\nActuators\nTotal research and technology\n$26 million\nThe first (and costliest) of these categories involves\nseveral detailed design problems that are self-explanatory\nas presented here.\nStructural analysis and dynamics is the first research\narea to be addressed. A structural model is required to\nexplore the limits of static and dynamic stability over\n\n149\n\nthe entire range of possihle operating parameters. Topics\nrequiring attention include interaction of the structure\nwith the stream of accelerating buckets, thrust vectoring,\nbucket steering, stabilization of oscillations and perturbations, and downrange guidance for the lunar launcher.\nElectrical analysis and design includes the important\ntask of optimizing electrical configurations for both\nlunar launchers and reaction engines. Other tasks include\ninductance modeling to determine restoring force profiles, an evaluation of the effects of harmonics in the\ndrive current wave form, oscillation-induced radiation\nlosses, and effects of induced voltages on the SCR\'s.\nStudies must be made to determine optimum techniques\nfor recharging the capacitors, returning regenerated\nbrake energy to the system, and sensing the position of\nbuckets. Finally, it must be determined what effects\npassing through the Van Allen belts will have on the\nsystem.\nThe category of miscellaneous considerations includes\nfirst a detailed systems study, such as the study represented by the very crude first approach of the OPT 4\nprogram presented here. The startup and shutdown of\nreaction engines and lunar launchers have not been considered thus far, but may have a significant effect on the\noverall system design. One final item in the miscellaneous category which merits early attention is the possibility of using the reaction mass or payload as a heat\nsink. Considering the very large fraction of total system\nmass devoted to waste heat radiators, this technique\ncould result in substantial mass reduction, even if it\nshould require the use of a heat pump.\nA basic mass-driver model, built at M.I.T. by some of\nthe present authors, was demonstrated at Princeton in\nMay 1977. Its accelerating section is 2 m long and accelerates a 0.5-kg bucket at 33 g to 36 m/sec. This is a\nsingle-shot (push only) system using aluminum rather\nthan a superconductor, with an ultimate capability of\n100 g.\nThe next model to be built, the Princeton-M.I.T.\nmodel will be 10 m long and will have an acceleration of\nseveral hundred g\'s. It will have a caliber of 13.1 cm,\nwith an evacuated glass tube located between the drive\ncoils and the bucket. The bucket will have two superconducting coils.\nThe third model will be 100 m long and reach\n960 m/sec at 1000 g. It should represent the first prototype for an orbital transfer reaction engine, including\nbucket return loop. If operated in an evacuated tunnel,\nit could serve as a test bed for structural as well as\nelectrical design considerations.\n\n150\n\nAll areas mentioned previously involve the development of mass drivers. It appears that no advances in the\ntechnology involved are required to achieve a practical\nmass driver. There are, however, a number of areas in\nwhich significant advances could dramatically improve\nthe performance of mass drivers (as well as other space\nhardware). For this reason, a modest development effort\nis proposed for component improvement. Components\nthat appear to offer potential for improvement are:\nPower supplies: photovoltaic, nuclear\nCapacitors: dielectric, vacuum\nSCR\'s: alternatives in packaging and heat removal\nSuperconductors and associated cryogenic structure\nRadiators and heat pipes\nMechanical actuators\nIn relation to the proposed flight tests, note that\nthese will be simpler in some respects than terrestrial\ntests. There is no need for vacuum insulation, and prototype systems will have been reduced to a number of\nidentical modules sized for shuttle transportation (20 m\nlong).\nFunding Requirements\nThe funding requirements are estimated below, based\non the optimized system masses derived earlier.\nMASS-DRIVER R&D FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\n(millions of dollars)\nResearch and technology\nBasic design and technology\nComponent improvements\nFlight de monstration\nSite selection for lunar launcher\nLunar orbital survey\nLunar lander survey\nGround test facility\nMDRE no. 1\nMDRE no. 2\nMDRE no. 3\nLunar launcher\nTotal\n\n$\n\n10\n6\n36\n150\n500\n25\n465\n300\n165\n1480\n\n$3137\n\nWe assume development costs and learning curves typical\nof other space projects. Our baseline scenario represents\nan all-out effort and is recognized to be extremely ambitious in terms of both costs and schedule. However, it\ndoes seem to be a realistic objective if a national commitment is made and given the required priority. In\n\nmany respects, the project seems more realistic than did\nthe Apollo program at the time it was embarked upon\njust 10 years ago.\nA very important aspect of the proposed program is\nthe fact that it would provide a badly needed long-term\ngoal. We have not had such a goal for several years. The\nstimulation provided by a long-term goal very often\ntranscends the ultimate value of the goal itself. Pyramids, cathedrals, and manned spaceflight all serve to\nconfirm this assertion.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Arnold, W.;\n\nBowen, S.; Fine, K.; Kaplan, D.;\nKolm, H.; Kolm, M.; Newman, J.; O\'Neill, G.

BENDER, R. SCOTT DUNBAR, and DAVID 1. ROSS\n\nLow-delta- V asteroids are to be found among those which have perihelia near 1 A U. From the 50 known asteroids\nwith perihelia less than 1.5 AU, 10 candidates for asteroid retrieval missions were selected on the basis of low eccentricity and inclination. To estimate the ranges of orbital elements for which capture in Earth orbit may be feasible, a\n0\nsurvey was made of 180 transfers from a set of orbits having elements near those of the Earth to the Earth. For 2 of\nthe 10 low-delta- V asteroids and for an additional one with elements more Earth-like than any yet known, direct ballistic round trips in the 1980\'s were computed. A stay time of several months at the asteroid was used. The results show\nthat the total delta V, including that for rendezvous with Earth upon return, for the known asteroids is above\n14 km/sec. But if asteroids are found similar to the strawman considered, the total delta V could be as low as\n10 km/sec.\nTo obtain trajectories with lower delta V than the direct ballistic cases, three modifications to the trajectories that\nuse gravity-assisted flybys are considered: a lunar gravity assist at both departure and arrival at Earth, Earth- VenusEarth flights which can greatly increase or decrease heliocentric energy, and low-thrust Earth-to-Earth transfers to\nincrease or decrease the V00 at Earth.\nBallistic studies using Earth- Venus-Earth return trajectories were made for 3 of the 10 low-delta- V asteroids. These\nstudies can form the basis for low-thrust return trajectories, but only one low-thrust case was investigated. Low-thrust\nmission results are shown for a direct retrieval of the "Earth-like" asteroid and a gravity-assisted retrieval of 19 77 HB.\nAlthough they have the disadvantage of longer mission times, the gravity-assisted trajectories make available for possible\nreturn a much wider range of targets, as opposed to the severely restricted class of orbital elements required for direct\nmissions; for example, the 1977 HB return requires a delta V of only 3.04 km/sec using low thrust and gravity assists.\nThe final phase of the return of an asteroid is capture by the Earth-Moon system, which is accomplished by a lunar\ngravity assist even though V00 at Earth arrival is as high as 1.5 km/sec. A sample trajectory showing capture into an\norbit near the 2: 1 Earth-Moon resonance is presented.\nWith the discovery of new Earth-approaching asteroids for direct missions and more detailed and exhaustive trajectory studies for gravity-assisted missions, it is felt that asteroid round trips with delta- V values as low as 6 km/sec can be\nfound. This work serves only to demonstrate the feasibility of asteroid return missions and to indicate possible directions for future studies.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMany types of asteroid mISSIons, including flybys\n(refs. 1,2), rendezvous (ref. 3), and sample return missions (ref. 4) have been discussed previously. Recently,\nthe idea of retrieving all or part of an Earth-approaching\nasteroid as raw material for space manufacturing has\nbeen proposed. This paper addresses the problems of\n\ntrajectory dynamics crucial to this scheme and proposes\nseveral techniques for conducting such a mission.\nClearly, only those asteroids accessible with the\nlowest possible delta V to rendezvous will be of interest,\nat least for the time being. Such low-delta-V asteroids\nwill be those crossing or inside the orbit of Mars, with\nsmall eccentricity, low inclination, and a semimajor axis\nnear 1 AU.\n\n161\n\nIn addition to trajectories that travel directly from\nEarth to an asteroid and return, the greatest possible use\nwill be made of gravity assists. Earth escape and capture\nwill be facilitated by lunar-gravity assists. In the solar\nsystem, flybys of Earth and Venus will be used to shape\nthe trajectory, with a consequent reduction in total\ndelta V. Finally, the possibility of low-thrust trajectories\nbetween gravitational encounters will be considered\nbriefly. (However, it was not possible to explore this\nconcept in depth here.)\n\nLOW-DELT A-V ASTEROIDS\nA low-delta-V asteroid is one for which the total\nimpulse to rendezvous, including Earth launch delta V, is\namong the lowest known. In this study, the return of a\nsignificant part of the asteroid is considered and thus the\ntotal impulse to return to Earth, including that for\nrendezvous with Earth, must also be as low as possible.\nGenerally, the outbound and return thrust requirements\nshould be essentially the same, but to return an asteroid,\ncontrary to expectation, the outbound delta V must be\nminimized at the expense of the inbound delta V\n(ref. 5).\nThe low-delta-V asteroids will be found among those\nwhich come near the Earth; such a list is obtained by\narranging all the asteroids by perihelion distance (Ql).\nOrbital elements of the 53 asteroids with perihelion\nunder 1.5 AU are given in table 1. The designation (L)\nafter the name indicates that the asteroid is lost. The\nelements listed are semimajor axis (A), eccentricity\n(ECC), inclination to the ecliptic (lNCL) and aphelion\ndistance (Q2). Two of the 53 asteroids - 1977 HA and\n1977 HB - were discovered in April 1977. In addition,\norbital elements for seven large fireballs (meteoroids)\nare added to indicate a range of orbital elements for\nlarge objects that have intersected the Earth\'s orbit.\nIn selecting the low-delta-V asteroids from this list,\nnote that a delta V of 6 km/sec for Earth escape to\nasteroid rendezvous or for return would allow the spacecraft to reach to ::=1.8 AU for e =0.45 and i = 0, or to\ni = 12\xc2\xb0 for a = 1 AU and e = O. These values, namely\na ~ 1.8 AU, e ,;;;; 0.45, and i ~ 12\xc2\xb0, are used as limits\nin selecting asteroids although by doing so regions\nare included for which the ~ V would exceed 6 km/sec.\nSix asteroids are thus selected from table 1: 1976 UA,\n1977 HB, Toro, 1959 LM, 1973 EC, and Eros. Another\nseven lie near but outside this boundary: Adonis,\nHermes, Apollo, 6743 PL, Geographos, Amor, and Ivar.\nIf the three lost asteroids are excluded from this set of\n\n162\n\n13, 10 may be considered as 10w-delta-V asteroids (see\ntable 2).\n\nBALLISTIC TRAJECTORIES\nTo estimate in a general way the delta-V values for\nreturn of material from asteroid orbits, we first examined the ballistic equivalent trajectories for a general\nclass of objects with orbital parameters near those of\nEarth. The range of semimajor axes was from 0.8 to 1.2;\nof eccentricities, from 0 to 0.4; and of inclination, from\n0\xc2\xb0 to 10\xc2\xb0. These limits approximate those developed\nabove by setting a bound on the delta V at Earth of\n6 km/sec to produce an elliptical orbit or an inclined\norbit. This value is higher than can reasonably be provided by available thrust systems operating on an asteroidal mass, but these limits encompass the ranges of\norbital elements that will be of interest.\nThe delta-V values are computed for 180\xc2\xb0 ballistic\ntransfer from the asteroid orbit to Earth. For no inclination of the asteroid orbit, the total delta V is known to\nbe optimal. Figure 1 shows delta V at the asteroid as a\nfunction of eccentricity and semimajor axis of the asteroid orbit. The contours of constant delta V are marked\nwith the delta V (in kilometers per second) and a symbol\nto indicate whether the departure is from the aphelion\nof the asteroid orbit (number within triangle) or from\nthe perihelion (encircled numbers). The delta Vat Earth\nto yield rendezvous is indicated only for 1.5 km/sec,\nwhich is taken to be the upper limit of the approach\nvelocity for "free" capture with a lunar gravity assist\n( dashed lines).\nFor transfers from inclined orbits to Earth, the first\nimpulse is applied at a node and is assumed to establish a\ntransfer orbit that is coplanar with and tangent to the\nEarth\'s orbit 180\xc2\xb0 from the node. For simplicity, only\norbits with the nodes at perihelion and aphelion are\nconsidered.

Its\nposition is indicated in figure 3, but, because it has an\ninclination of 5.9\xc2\xb0, the delta-V values from the graph are\ntoo smalL In an effort to present an example of a\nmoderate delta-V requirement, a fictitious asteroid,\nAmes SSS 77, is hypothesized with the following elements: semimajor axis, 1.08 AU; eccentricity, 0.18;\ninclination, 5\xc2\xb0; longitude of ascending node, 0\xc2\xb0; argument of perihelion, 45\xc2\xb0; and mean anomaly, 0\xc2\xb0, on\n14 November 1979.\nThe position of this asteroid is also marked in\nfigure 3, which indicates that the delta-V value to depart\nfrom the asteroid to Earth can be as low as 2.3 to\n3.4 km/sec (if the relative positions of Earth and the\nasteroid are those required for the transfer). The capture\nby Earth should ideally require only a small delta V to\nreduce the approach speed to the 1.5 km/sec assumed as\nsatisfactory for lunar-assisted capture.\nSuppose that delta V at the asteroid is limited to\n3 km/sec and the Earth approach speed is limited to the\n"free" capture speed of 1.5 km/sec. Then, from figure 1,\n\nConsider a spacecraft moving in the gravitational field\nof a central body and assume that a moderately massive\nsecondary body is also moving in the field. The spacecraft can be directed to approach the secondary body\nclosely, causing the spacecraft to change its direction\nand magnitude of velocity in the field of the central\nbody. It is assumed to occur essentially instantaneously\nat the position of the secondary body. A gravity-assisted\nflyby uses this change in spacecraft velocity to enhance\nthe mission under consideration.\nFor asteroid sample return missions, and particularly\nfor asteroid retrieval, a gravity assist by the Moon in the\nEarth\'s gravity field would lower the delta-V requirement significantly. It has been shown that capture by\nthe Earth-Moon system can occur for a hyperbolic\napproach velocity to the Earth as high as 1.85 km/sec\n(ref. 6). Similarly, an escape velocity of 1.85 km/sec can\nbe achieved on a parabolic trajectory in the Earth\'s field\nby a lunar flyby on the outbound leg. These cases\nrequire a grazing flyby of the Moon. To provide a safe\nmargin for guidance, V = 1.5 km/sec is used at Earth\napproach or departure. Multi pie flybys of the EarthMoon system with a lunar gravity assist at each could be\nused to capture at a higher velocity (ref. 6), but such\ntrajectories considerably lengthen total mission time\n(1 yr per pass). For two flybys, the upper limit is\n2.58 km/sec. An example of a single encounter capture\nis examined in a section (Lunar Gravity-Assisted\nCapture).\nMultiple flybys of a single secondary body cannot be\nused to change the magnitude of the hyperbolic\napproach speed to that body (if its orbit is circular),\nassuming that no delta V is applied along the trajectory\nbetween encounters. But if the trajectory is modified by\na gravity assist at a different body or by impulsive or\nlow-thrust delta V between encounters, dramatic\nchanges can be made. Bender and Friedlander (ref. 2)\nhave shown that, by means of a Venus-Earth gravityassisted trajectory, almost any asteroid in the main belt\ncan be approached on a ballistic trajectory with lower\nthan direct ballistic energy expenditure. In that study,\n\n165\n\nlaunch velocities of 3 to 5 km/sec from Earth were considered. The Venus flyby modifies the orbit so that the\nsubsequent Earth flyby is at a higher relative speed. The\nEarth return speeds used to reach the asteroid belt and\nbeyond were in the range of 8 to 14 km/sec. Moreover,\ntrajectories were found for dates of the Earth return\nflyby over a large fraction of any synodic period of\nEarth and Venus.\nPresumably, if any asteroid can be reached by an\nEarth-Venus-Earth trajectory, return trips are also possible with arrival conditions at Earth similar to the\nlow-energy launches considered by Bender and\nFriedlander (ref. 2). Additionally, for an asteroid to be\nretrievable by means of Earth and Venus gravity assists,\nthe asteroid must approach Earth or Venus so closely\nthat only a small delta V is required for the first\nencounter.\nA technique little studied to date is to shape a trajectory by low thrust between gravitational maneuvers.\nThis concept is applied here to reduce an Earth flyby\nspeed from 3-5 km/sec at return from Venus to\n1.5 km/sec as needed for the final capture. Table 3\nshows some test results obtained when the flyby speed\nwas reduced by low-thrust propulsion between two\nEarth encounters. EqUivalent delta V is the total delta V\nsupplied by the low-thrust system. Low-thrust propulsion effectively reduces the relative speed at Earth\narrival. Capture by the Earth-Moon system can be managed in 410 days or less at approach speeds from 3 to\n5 km/sec with a low-thrust delta V that provides from\n1 to 2.7 km/sec.\nTABLE 3.- EARTH-TO-EARTH FOR LOWERING\nV 00; FINAL V 00 = 1.5 km/sec\nInitial V00\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nEqUivalent\nt.v, km/sec\n\n0.46\n\n0.96\n\n2.13\n\n2.69\n\nTime, days\n\n370\n\n390\n\n390\n\n410\n\nIf this capture process is combined with Venus-Earth\ngravity assists, a great range of asteroid orbits is opened\nfor asteroid retrieval. The low-thrust system is required\nmainly to provide for the first Earth or Venus encounter\nand the capture phase. The only requirement is that the\ntotal velocity change required to produce a flyby of\nEarth (or Venus) be small. The known candidates are\nlisted in table 2. A Venus encounter requires that the\nperihelion distance be less than 0.72 AU; a crossing of\n\n166\n\nthe Venus orbit plane at Venus\'s distance from the Sun\nis unlikely. An Earth encounter similarly requires that\nthe perihelion distance be less than 1.0 AU. But crossing\nthe Earth orbit plane near 1 AU is very likely since this\nis essentially the condition required for discovering it.\nResults of testing a few asteroids from table 1 indicate\nthat a delta V of about 500 m/sec represents the lower\nrange of values for achieving the first Earth encounter.\nThe total delta V for the return phase of an asteroid\nretrieval will be from 2-4 km/sec, possibly sometimes as\nlow as 1.5 km/sec.\nIf the smaller fraction of the total delta V is needed\nat the start of the retrieval process, it and the navigational delta-V values required to control the flybys\nmight be supplied by a relatively modest mass driver.\nThe final larger delta V, upon Earth return from Venus,\ncould be supplied by a larger mass driver sent to rendezvous with the asteroid in its nearly final and much lower\ndelta-V orbit, provided sufficient time remains to accumulate the required delta V.\n\nBALLISTIC RESULTS\nDirect Retrievals\nBallistic mission studies for asteroid sample return\nwere performed for several asteroids, including some of\ninterest for possible asteroid retrievals. Although there is\nlittle possibility of ballistic asteroid retrieval, ballistic\nstudies do show the relative costs of reaching and bringing back various asteroids. The delta-V values found will\nnot differ greatly from the low-thrust delta-V values.\nActual ballistic round trips to two asteroids 1977 HB\nand 1974 EC are shown in table 4. Additional data are\nshown for the hypothetical asteroid Ames SSS 77\n(table 5) in a later opportunity, which is representative\nof those that might be discovered. The fact that the real\ndepartures and arrivals with a considerable stay time at\nthe asteroid have been required means that delta V will\nbe considerably larger than for the ideal two impulse\ntransfer between the orbits. Table 4 is divided into three\nparts: dates and time intervals, impulses needed, and\norbit elements. The impulse to remove Voo at Earth is\nincluded in the total delta V because the asteroid must\nbe captured. All legs were optimized on total delta V for\nrendezvous. Ecliptic plane projections of the orbits of\nSSS 77 and 1977 HB are illustrated in figures 4 and 5\ndrawn to the same scale so that differences are easily\nobserved. Ames SSS 77 is significantly more accessible\nthan 1977 HB.

If this "free" delta V were 1.5 km/sec, the\ntotal delta V would be reduced by 3 km/sec. Note also\nthat the total impulse required on the retrieval phase for\nAmes SSS 77 is 3.76 + 1.68 - 1.5 or 3.94 km/sec, which\nlies between 3 to 4 km/sec, postulated previously for the\nminimum total delta V to retrieve an asteroid by direct\nflight to Earth.\nEarth-Venus-Earth Gravity-Assisted\n(EVEGA) Retrievals\nAs mentioned in the preceding section, one method\nfor reducing overall delta V during retrieval is to use\ngravity assists by Earth and Venus. In this technique, the\norbital inclination and the high excess hyperbolic velocity at the first Earth encounter can be decreased to\nvalues that are amenable to a relatively easy capture\nmaneuver into high Earth orbit. The cost is the flight\ntime to Venus and back to Earth in one to three revolutions. A basic technique of searching for mission opportunities of this kind has been established but, as\nexpected, a high velocity at the first Earth approach\ncannot be reduced to low values in two or three revolutions for every date. In the data below, no more than\nthree revolutions were considered.\nThe scheme of using an EVEGA trajectory to retrieve\nan asteroid is as follows: (1) the asteroid is driven from\nits orbit by some sort of propulsion system (high or low\nthrust) so as to intercept the Earth, (2) the encounter is\ncontrolled so that the spacecraft flies on to Venus\n(ideally, with no intermediate thrusting during the\nflyby), and (3) it then makes a gravity-assisted flyby of\nVenus, sending it back to Earth for rendezvous. In\nsearching for mission opportunities of this type, each\nseparate leg was analyzed ballistically in hopes of finding\na suitable set of launch/arrival dates so that the hyperbolic excess velocities, V""in and V""out at each boundary point would be matched as closely as possible and\nthe velocity at the second Earth approach would be\nminimized (i.e., from 3-5 km/sec). Given the rough\nboundary dates derived from this survey, the entire case\ncould be run at once and optimized on total delta V\nfrom asteroid to Earth to Venus to Earth. The results of\nfour such cases are given in table 6.\nThese results indicate that the Earth-Venus-Earth\ngravity-assist technique will contribute significantly to\nthe retrieval of asteroid material. The flyby velocity at\nthe first Earth encounter on the return trip is sometimes\ntoo fast and sometimes too slow to match the "best"\nvalue for the gravity-assist geometry that occurs. It is\n\nTABLE 6.- ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF EVEGA RETRIEVAL TRAJECTORIES\nAsteroid\n\n1977 HB\n\nDeparture date\nat asteroid\n\nOct. 1,1986\n\nMar. 19, 1983\n\nFeb. 8, 1990\n\nFeb. 14, 1994\n\nLl V at asteroid\n\n1.06 km/sec\n\n0.61 km/sec\n\n1.18 km/sec\n\n1.43 km/sec\n\nEarth flyby\n\nApr. 15, 1987\n\nOct. 18, 1983\n\nOct. 17, 1990\n\nMay 24,1995\n\nVoo.\n\n12.29 km/sec\n\n12.62 km/sec\n\n11.90 km/sec\n\n7.01\n\nVoo\n\n9.24 km/sec\n\n11.46 km/sec\n\n8.36 km/sec\n\n8.95\n\n3.14 ER\n\n1.66 ER\n\n3.10 ER\n\n1.54\n\nVenus flyby\n\nMar. 10, 1988\n\nOct. 6, 1984\n\nJuly 28,1991\n\nMar. 17, 1996\n\nVoo.\n\n5.47 km/sec\n\n7.43 km/sec\n\n5.00\n\n5.38\n\nVoo\nout\nRad\n\n5.47 km/sec\n\n7.43 km/sec\n\n5.00\n\n5.38\n\n1.61 VR\n\n2.92 VR\n\n6.35\n\n3.06\n\nEarth arrival\n\nAug. 29, 1988\n\nMar. 27, 1986\n\nFeb. 9, 1992\n\nAug. 31, 1996\n\nVoo\n\n3.04 km/sec\n\n6.72 km/sec\n\n5.24 km/sec\n\n3.36 km/sec\n\nBallistic total\nLl Va to rendezvous 6.721 km/sec\n\n8.276 km/sec\n\n9.411 km/sec\n\n7.432 km/sec\n\nTotal time\n\n1104 days\n\n731 days\n\n929 days\n\n1976 UA\n\n1976 UA\n\n1973 EC\n\nIn\n\nout\nRad\n\nIn\n\n698 days\n\naLl Vat Earth used at periapse, and is less than IV00.\n\nIn\n\ntherefore conceivable that, when more asteroids are\nfound, it will be possible to obtain cases for which there\nis a closer match of V 00\' and V00 t at Earth. The earth\nIn\nou\nreturn velocities are sometimes too high, but it is\nbelieved that, if only cases for which this velocity is\nunder 5 km/sec are considered, there will still be many\nopportunities. These are ballistic results and the addition\nof low-thrust techniques to those of gravity assist will\nresult in successful asteroid retrieval trajectories in\nalmost every case. One such case developed from the\n1977 HB results is presented in table 7.\nLOW-THRUST RESULTS\nIt has been shown that the total delta V for retrieving\nan asteroid is likely to range from 2 to 4 km/sec. To\nestimate the capability of a mass driver in supplying such\na delta V, suppose that delta V is supplied at the rate of\n1 km/sec/yr to a 200-m-diameter asteroid with a mass of\n10 10 kg (density = 2.39 g/cm 3 ). The acceleration is\n31.7X 10- 6 m/sec 2 and, if the mass is expelled at\n5000 m/sec, the power required is 792 MW and the mass\nflow rate is 63.4 kg/sec. These are strong requirements\non the mass-driver system and it may not be possible to\n\n-\n\nVoutl.\n\nmeet them. If not, the size of the asteroid would have to\nbe reduced or the flight time increased so that the total\ndelta V would be supplied at a slower initial rate.\nLow-thrust techniques can be used to improve the\nballistic retrieval trajectories in table 6. A low-thrust\ntrajectory can be used from the asteroid to first Earth\nencounter in such a way as to supply the proper magnitude of V00 at Earth. For 1977 HB, this technique was\ncombined with an additional revolution about the Sun,\nthat is, by starting one revolution earlier from the asteroid orbit. The Earth flyby encounter and velocity were\nobtained at a total delta V of 2.04 km/sec supplied in\n653 days. This slightly exceeds the acceleration value of\n1 km/sec/yr adopted as a nominal upper limit. With a\nlow-thrust Earth-to-Earth trajectory at a delta V of\n1.00 km/sec to reduce V00 at capture from 3.04 to\n1.5 km/sec (as in table 3), the return of 1977 HB is\npossible with a total delta V of 3.04 km/sec. As shown\nin table 7, the return begins from the asteroid orbit on\n1 July 1985, with a 653-day low-thrust transfer to\nEarth; "free" flybys of Earth, Venus, and Earth in\nsuccession; and, finally, a 390-day low-thrust trajectory\nbefore final Earth encounter on 23 September 1989.\n\n169\n\nTABLE 7.- RETRIEVAL OF 1977 HB\nEarth launch\n\nApr. 28, 1984\n214 days\n\n(6.32 km/sec)\n\n1977 HB (arr)\n\nNov. 28,1984\n216 days\n\nImp 2.53 km/sec\n\n1977 HB (dep)\n\nJuly 1, 1985\n653 days\n\nLT 2.04 km/sec\n\nEarth (F.

However, the low thrust could possibly be applied\nduring the Earth-Venus-Earth portion to further reduce\nthe total delta-V requirement for capture. (No analysis\nof this variation in the technique was attempted here.)\nFinally, searches were made for suitable gravityassisted opportunities for an outbound trajectory to\n1977 HB. Unfortunately, no satisfactory gravity-assisted\ntrajectories could be found using less than three revolutions about the Sun with significantly less delta V than\nthat of the optimum direct impulsive case. Consequently, the retrieval scenario in table 7 for 1977 HB\ncontains the impulsive data for the Earth-to-asteroid\nportion. The total delta V given in table 7 reflects the\nassumption that V00 = 1.5 km/sec represents the launch\nor capture assistance provided by a lunar gravity assist.\n\n~Vret\n\n7.41 km/sec\n3.04 km/sec\n\nLUNAR-GRA VITY-ASSISTED CAPTURE\n\nAs mentioned previously, it is reasonably safe to use a\nlunar-gravity-assisted maneuver to capture an Earthapproaching body with a V00 relative to the Earth of less\nthan about 1.5 km/sec. At 1.85 km/sec, the capture\norbit is almost parabolic and there is no freedom in\nchoosing the radius of perigee. In considering the capture problem ballistically, it is desirable that the radius\nof perigee of the capture orbit equal the radius of\nperigee of the final desired orbit so that injection into\nthe desired orbit can be accomplished in one maneuver.\nBecause of its stability and favorable gravitational characteristics, the orbit in 2: 1 resonance with the Moon,\ndescribed by Heppenheimer (ref. 7), was chosen for this\nexample (fig. 6). For a sufficient margin of safety and\none that ensures capture of the approaching body into\nEarth orbit, a V00 =\nX lunar orbital velocity\n(= 1.447 km/sec) is considered. The body passes 184 km\nabove the lunar surface, which is considered an adequate\nmargin of safety, and has its orbit relative to the Moon\nbent 89.5\xc2\xb0 and its Earth-relative velocity reduced from\n2.046 to 1.316 km/sec. It is injected into an orbit having\na radi us of perigee of 0.3952 X lunar distance.\nAfter the lunar-gravity-assisted flyby, an impulsive\nvelocity change of 292.3 m/sec at the perigee is sufficient for injection into the 2: I orbit. In practice, since\nthe stability of the 2: 1 orbit depends on the avoidance\nof close lunar approaches by having the body at apogee\n\nv\'2\n\nIt is realized that the total outbound delta V to\nasteroid rendezvous is more important than the return\ndelta V in terms of providing the maximum return per\nunit cost (ref. 5). Unfortunately, the 1977 HB case was\ndeveloped naively on the basis of minimizing the return\ndelta V. The present outbound results remove it from\nserious consideration. None of the other cases in table 6\nwere investigated, but the outbound results for 1977 HB\nwere instructive and indicate that satisfactory cases\nshould be found - especially when more Earthapproaching asteroids are known.\n\n170\n\n,\n\n= 0.005 = 1920 km (184 km AL TlTUOEI. {j = 89.5\xc2\xb0\nPMOON\n\n_---------\n\nLUNAR\nORBIT\nV =1\n\n.........\n\n......... -\n\nT=4.939\na = 2.90\ne = 0.8775\n\'p = 0.3552\n\n~\n\n-- ----\n\n--\n\nVs = ,;2(= 1.447 km/sl\n\nFigure 6.- Trajectory geometry for lunar-assisted capture into Earth orbit.\nwhen the Moon is 90\xc2\xb0 away, injection into the 2: 1 orbit\nwould be a two-stage process. First, a near 2: 1 orbit\nwould be achieved and allowed to coast until a suitable\nrelationship with the Moon had been established and a\nsecond velocity change performed to lock the orbit into\nresonance. For a low-thrust mission, the capture orbit\nwould be gradually changed over several periods to\naccomplish the same thing with a considerably higher\nequivalent delta V.\nThis simple scenario ignores two interesting possibilities. The first is the use of continuous thrust after lunar\nencounter to further retard the body. A body with\nincoming V00 = 2.25 km/sec injected into a hyperbola\nwith perigee at 6 Earth radii may be captured with a\ncontinuous thrust under 5 microgee (5XI0- S m/sec 2 )\napplied during the time the body is within the lunar\norbit. Thus bodies with approach velocities considerably\nhigher than the nominal 1.5 km/sec could be captured\nwith minimal effort.\nThe second interesting consideration ignored by this\nanalysis concerns mUltiple lunar encounters with a lowthrust interplanetary trajectory between the Earth\napproaches. Preliminary investigation indicates this may\nbe very promising, but more thorough analysis is not\npossible at this time.\n\noutbound. This would require a significant increase in\nthe number of known Earth-approaching asteroids such\nthat several with more favorable orbital elements for this\ntype of mission are found. The total delta V for the real\nasteroid 1943 is about 11 km/sec.\nOn the other hand, gravity-assisted trajectories to\nrendezvous with an asteroid and to return it to Earth\nmay have total delta-V values as low as 6 km/sec. This\nrequires fortuitous timing and geometry so that good\nEarth-Venus-Earth trajectories are available for both outbound and inbound flights. However, they do not\nrequire as limited a class of orbital elements for suitable\ntargets as are needed for direct retrieval. In fact, several\ncandidates are known, and every asteroid discovered by\nvirtue of a close approach to Earth becomes yet another\ncandidate. A return trajectory using low thrust for the\nasteroid 1977 HB was found with a delta-V requirement\nof only 3.04 km/sec. Although no satisfactory outbound\nflight arriving at this asteroid less than 1 year before the\nreturn flight was found, it is confidently expected that,\nas asteroids are studied and more are discovered, cases\nwill be found that do indeed provide retrieval for a total\n(round-tri p) delta V of 5 km/sec.\nAnother technique involves the use of Earth-to-Earth\nlow-thrust trajectories. These are used to increase the\nV00 of a spacecraft at launch from 1.5 km/sec to\n3-5 km/sec (or to decrease V 00 for Earth approach from\n3-5 km/sec to 1.5 km/sec).\nFinally, the problem of capture into long-term stable\norbits about the Earth was examined. A satisfactory\nprocedure for entering resonant orbits was developed\nand data presented for entering the 2: 1 resonant orbits\nfor V00 = 1.5 km/sec at Earth approach.\nIt appears from these studies that a significant\namount of asteroidal material can be retrieved by techniques well within the grasp of present technology. More\nwork is needed on the discovery of asteroids, the search\nfor good mission opportunities, and possibly the development of ether useful techniques to return an asteroid\nwhich will be technically and economically feasible. In\naddition, precursor missions to establish asteroid composition and structure are essential.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nREFERENCES\n\nIt has been shown that direct round-trip trajectories\nfor asteroid retrieval missions may be possible with a\ntotal delta V of the order of 7 km/sec, assuming that\nlunar-gravity-assisted flybys are used both inbound and\n\n1.

ROSS, and ROBERT SALKELD\n\nEarlier scenarios for mass-driver retrieval of asteroidal materials have been tested and refined after new data were\nconsidered on mass-driver performance, favorable delta- V opportunities to Earth-approaching asteroids with gravity\nassists, designs for mining equipment, opportunities for processing volatiles and free metals at the asteroid, mission\nscenarios, and parametric studies of the most significant variables. We conclude that the asteroid-retrieval option is competitive with the retrieval of lunar materials for space manufacturing, while a carbonaceous object would provide a\ndistinctive advantage over the Earth as a source of consumables and raw materials for biomass in space settlements\nduring the 1990\'s. We recommend immediate studies on asteroid-retrieval mission opportunities, an increased search\nand followup program, precursor missions, trade-offs with the Moon and Earth as sources of materials, and supporting\ntechnology.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nO\'Neill proposed that lunar and asteroidal materials\nmay be economically mined and processed in space for\nthe construction of high orbital habitats (ref. 1) and\nsatellite solar power stations (ref. 2). The 1976 NASAAmes Summer Study on Space Settlements (ref. 3) corroborated early estimates that these concepts could be\ncarried out on a large scale in the 1990\'s with an initial\ninvestment comparable to that of the Apollo program\nusing present technologies. In the scenario considered,\nan electromagnetic mass driver on the Moon would\npropel lunar material into .free space for subsequent\ntransfer to a space manufacturing facility (SMF) for\nchemical processing and fabrication into large structures.\nThe mass driver would also serve as an orbital transfer\nvehicle, possibly reducing the cost of transport from low\nEarth orbit, where the external tanks for the Space\nShuttle would be pelletized into reaction mass (ref. 4).\nO\'Leary (ref. 5) explored the possibility of using\nmass-driver tugs to move Earth-approaching asteroids at\nopportunities of low-velocity increment to the vicinity\nof the Earth. Carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and free\nmetals, apparently scarce on the Moon, may be abundant on some asteroids; possibly, the retrieval of aster-\n\noidal materials may be cost-competitive with that of\nlunar materials in an early program of space manufacturing. A scenario was developed (ref. 6) where a 100-MW\nmass driver, assembled in space with about 50 Space\nShuttle flights, would retrieve about 22 percent of a\n200-m-diameter (1 X 10 7 -metric ton) asteroid through a\nvelocity increment Ll V of 3 km/sec in 5 years. Many\nsuch objects are believed to be within reach of Earthbased telescopes in ongoing search programs.\nThe current study tests the assumptions made in\nearlier work and refines the existing scenario. Two COllpanion papers describe, in detail, (1) delta-V requirements for favorable round-trip missions to currently\nknown candidates and probable future ones (ref. 7) and\n(2) asteroidal resources and recommendations for\nexpanding the search program, followup for orbital\ndetermination and chemical classification, and identification of precursor missions (ref. 8).\nThis paper describes scenarios for asteroid retrieval\n(1) for a real object (asteroid 1977 HB with gravity\nassists from Earth, Venus, and the Moon) and (2) for a\nlikely hypothetical case, given an increase in the asteroid\ndiscovery rate and improved mission-analysis techniques.\nSeveral topics are discussed: values for delta V, energy\n\n173\n\nrequirements, role of man, design of outbound massdriver system, assembly and attachment to asteroid,\nmining operations, timing and logistics of the retrieval\noperation, the selection of volatiles and free metals, and\noptions for using hydrogen and oxygen processed at the\nasteroid for fuel. The second section places this scenario\nin a parametric context, which will identify the most\nsignificant variables in comparing the economics of\ntransport, into a stable high orbit, of asteroidal, lunar,\nand terrestrial materials. This paper concludes with\nrecommendations for a research and development program designed to provide technology readiness for asteroid retrieval by the mid-1980\'s. An appendix, by Robert\nSalkeld, presents a cost comparison of asteroidal vs lunar\nderived materials.\nWe appreciate the help and advice of many individuals during this study: John Shettler and Edward Bock,\nwho sketched some of the design concepts for asteroid\nretrieval; Stuart Bowen, who provided mass-driver data;\nand David Bender, Fred Mascy, and John Niehoff, who\nprovided valuable insights into trajectories and mission\nanalysis.\n\nGROUND RULES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nFirst, we assume that it is desirable to minimize the\nmass of the equipment required to retrieve the asteroid:\nrendezvous engine and propellants, mining apparatus,\nequipment for preparing reaction mass at the asteroid\nand for successfully returning the asteroid (or portions\nthereof). The mass of the retriever must be kept low\nbecause of the large Earth-to-orbit launch costs (at about\n$700/kg and $240/kg for an upgraded Space Shuttle)\nand equipment costs (assumed to be $400/kg or three\ntimes that of modern aircraft).\nThe selection of an optimal exhaust velocity Ve for\nthe asteroid-retriever mass driver depends on various\nparameters, which were recently revised by the MassDriver Study Group of this summer study. The earlier\nasteroid-retrieval study (ref. 6) considered\nVe - 2 km/sec, which was optimized for maximum\nreturned mass per unit power imparted to the reaction\nmass through a total one-way delta V of 3 km/sec, a\nvalue that appears reasonable for the most favorable\nknown cases (ref. 7). This value suggested commonality\nin design with the lunar mass driver and mass drivers\ndesigned for orbital transfer between high orbits (e.g.,\nlong-term SMF orbits, lunar orbit) and geosynchronous\norbit. A higher-thrust mass driver would act as a booster\n\n174\n\nto spiral the asteroid retriever from low-Earth orbit to\nhigh-Earth orbit, as in the lunar scenario (ref. 4).\nHowever, further consideration of the relationship\nbetween exhaust velocity and mass-driver mass for constant thrust and an analysis of the requirements for the\noutbound leg of the retrieval mission led us to conclude\nthat a single-stage, high-thrust mass driver alone may\nperform the retrieval. For a nominal delta V from Earth\nescape of 3 km/sec, in addition to the 6.4 km/sec\nrequired to achieve escape from low-Earth orbit by low\nthrust, Ve - 8 km/sec appears to be a reasonable value\nfor the mass-driver retriever. Commonality in design is\nagain possible when the former booster becomes the\nretriever itself.\nThe use of the same mass-driver design for diverse\ntasks suggests minimal development costs which would\nbe uniquely attributable to the asteroid retriever. We\nhave assumed that a mass driver would be used for the\nfirst asteroid retrieval because of the common design\nproperty and because the mass driver has some attractive\nfeatures not offered by most alternative propulsion\nsystems: high throughput-to-mass ratio, relative ease of\npreparation and use of asteroidal material as reaction\nmass (the fuel is "free" at the asteroid), high efficiency\nof operations, and near-term technology required for\ntimely development.\nWe have further assumed that the size of the asteroid\nfragment to be retrieved is about 100 m in diameter\n(IX 10 6 metric tons). Such a fragment is at the lower\nend of the size range of objects accessible to telescopic\nsearch programs. It would provide about O.SX 10 6 metric\ntons of material in high-Earth orbit, which is comparable\nto a few years throughput of lunar material in the lunar\nresource retrieval scenario (ref. 3). This size would be\nappropriate for first mission(s) where "one-time" development costs would be in reasonable proportion to total\nmission costs while their sum would be within the scope\nof current NASA planning and would require moderate,\ntemporary use of an upgraded (class II) Space Shuttle. A\nmore quantitative investigation of this assumption is\npresented later. If the best initial candidate is more\nmassive than 10 6 metric tons, it would be necessary to\n.break off a piece for the first recovery.\nWe assume that the first asteroid retrieval mission will\nbe manned. In our opinion, the assemhly and mining\noperations are sufficiently complex, with real-time decisions governing equipment several light-minutes from\nEarth, that an automated mission would be a formidable\ntask. It follows that the total mission time should be\nkept as low as realistically possible, with crew changes\nonly about once a year. Such crew changes could be\n\nconveniently carried out at times of Earth gravity assist\n(described later). A minimum round-trip time for an\nasteroid mission would be about I year, corresponding\nto a one-way Hohmann transfer time of about 6 months\nfrom Earth to the asteroid on an Earth-like orbit. But\nmost optimal transfer times are considerably longer,\nparticularly when gravity assists are used (ref. 7). For the\noptimal retrieval of a 10 6 -metric-ton asteroid, a throughput of about 4 kg/sec of reaction mass would be\nrequired for a 3-year return time.\n\nVOLATILE AND FREE METAL RETRIEVAL\nFROM ASTEROIDS\nMost ordinary and low-grade carbonaceous chondrite\nmeteorites - and, by inference, asteroids - contain\n;GlO-percent free metals, water, and carbon. Water and\ncarbon dominate this phase in carbonaceous objects of\ntypes I and II; metals dominate in ordinary chondrites.\nOne class of carbonaceous objects has appreciable percentages of all three, comprising about 20 percent of the\nbody by weight. At a modest additional cost in the\nmining operations of the asteroid, the free metals can be\nsifted out and magnetically separated and H2 0, and CO 2\ncan be extracted by heating the asteroidal fragments in a\n0\nsolar furnace to about 600 C. After the H2 0 and CO 2\nare extracted, the remaining material would serve as\nreaction mass. This operation would be continuous at\nthe asteroid, corresponding to the nominal throughput\nof 4 kg/sec for a 3-year mission to return about\n0.5X 10 6 tons of material.\nThe SMF site would receive about 100,000 metric\ntons of free metals (mostly Fe/Ni), 50,000 metric tons\nof water, 20,000 metric tons of carbon compounds with\nthe remainder for reaction mass, shielding, and processing into oxygen, ceramics, glasses, and metals.\nThe 1977 Summer Study projected that 3100 persons\ncould be in high orbit by 1991 to process, in space,\nnon terrestrial materials into satellite power stations. If it\nis assumed that 3 kg/person/day is required for con sumabies (half of which is water in "wet" food with some\nadditional nitrogen and oxygen to replace airlock leakage) and about 0.5 ton/person of carbon, hydrogen, and\noxygen imported for biomass to establish farming operations in space, it follows that about 30,000 tons of\nwater, carbon compounds, and nitrogen will be required\nfor the first decade of large-scale production of satellite\npower stations from non terrestrial materials. Unless\ntrapped volatiles are found in permanently shadowed\nareas on the Moon, these materials must come from\n\nEarth or asteroids. Processing a 10 6 -ton carbonaceous\nasteroid for volatiles will provide more than enough\nmaterial for consumables and for establishing space\nfarms.\nA plant will be required to process the appropriate\nalloys and to fabricate them into useful structures, but\nthe power requirements for this are more than an order\nof magnitude less than those for extracting aluminum\nfrom lunar soil.\nThe relative energy requirements to produce structural elements from lunar ore (aluminum oxide) and\nfrom asteroidal ores (iron-nickel metal grains) can be\nestimated from basic chemical data. The energy necessary to reduce iron oxide to metallic iron in a blast\nfurnace is about 17X 10 6 J/kg (metal) and the theoretical lower limit (heat of formation) is about\n7.5X 10 6 J/kg (metal). The energy needed to melt\nmetallic iron (heat of fusion, about 10 cal/g; heat capacity, about 0.15 cal/g, 300-1600 K) is about 9XlO s J/kg\n(metal). The ratio between the energy required to reduce\nan oxide and to melt the metal per unit of metal is about\n8 (independent of efficiency). The heat of formation\nratios to produce metal from an oxide for aluminum\nversus iron is between 2 (Fe2 0 3 ) and 3 (FeO). Thus the\nenergy required to produce metallic aluminum from\nlunar oxide ore is 15 to 25 times higher than that needed\nto melt a metallic asteroidal ore per unit mass of metal.\nThe actual relative energy requirements will depend\non system designs (e.g., melting by means of solar furnace vs electrolysis and associated electricity-producing\nefficiency), the number of melt-freeze episodes necessary to refine the iron-nickel to construction grade alloy,\nand the ratio of metal mass necessary to provide the\nsame structural strength (about 2 to 3 times more favorable for aluminum). The economics should also consider\ntrace element recovery from NiFe (Ni, Co, Ge, Pt, etc.)\nduring the refinement process of iron.\nIf the asteroidal NiFe metal is used, the mass and\ncomplexity of the SMF chemical processing plant may\nbe reduced considerably, reducing the cost of an early\nprogram of non terrestrial material processing. It also\nappears that virtually all the materials required for SMF\noperations - consumables, plastics, graphite for radiators, solar reflectors, and possibly germanium for solar\ncells - would be available. If a lunar program is more\nfeasible at first, the economics of volatile and metal\nextraction from asteroids may be immediately competitive. If serious problems were to develop with the structural dynamics of mass drivers, water could possibly be\nused at the asteroid as fuel (liquid oxygen and hydrogen\nproduced from electrolysis) or as a working fluid to\n\n175\n\nreturn appreciable quantities of asteroidal materials.\nDetails of these concepts are explored later.\nASTEROID\n\nSCENARIO FOR ASTEROID RETRIEVAL\n\nQ\n"\'---\n\nA representative scenario was developed for capturing\na 10 6 -ton asteroid (see fig. 1). A single mass driver is\n\nPLANETARY\nASSISTS\n\nAV = 6.4 km/sec\nTO ESCAPE\n\n1.5 km/sec\nASSIST\n\nASTEROIO\n\n1.5 km/sec\nASSIST\n\nMOON\n\n~\n~\n\nG\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n~;-----\n\nAV = 5 km/sec\n\nL rJ\n\nFigure 2.- Inbound journey.\n\nPLANETARY\nASSISTS\n\n3 km/sec\nTO ASTEROID\nRENDEZVOUS\n\nFigure 1.- Outbound journey.\nused to accelerate the crew and the equipment for\nmining and retrieval to rendezvous with the asteroid.\nThat mass driver is then used to return a large fragment\nof the asteroid to Earth orbit. The scenario chosen uses a\nlow-thrust delta V of 6.4 km/sec to achieve Earth-escape\nspeed, a lunar gravity assist maneuver, and a further\ndelta V of 3 km/sec to intersect and rendezvous with the\nasteroid. Also, in the outbound trip, one or more\ngravity-assisted maneuvers are used with Earth and perhaps Venus (ref. 7).\nReturn delta V is taken to be 5 km/sec, including\ninsertion into a 2: 1 resonant SMF orbit (ref. 7) (see\nfig. 2). A mission to capture a portion of the asteroid\n1977 HB was used as a basic mission (ref. 2). The results\nof this investigation are shown in table 1. In this case,\nwhich was not optimized but was arrived at by trial and\n\nerror, the outbound delta V was intolerably large, even\nwith gravity assist. But the return delta V was between\n2 and 3 km/sec (the lower value obtainable with an extra\nEarth gravity assist). We concluded that, upon further\nanalysis, opportunities will be found for missions to\ncurrently known asteroids in which either the inbound\nor outbound delta V is on the order of 3 km/sec, with\nthe other leg larger. The strategy will be to find opportunities where some combination of both delta V values\nis minimized. The 5-km/sec return delta V was chosen\nbecause lowering the delta V of the initial leg will most\nlikely increase the final-leg velocities. As shown in a later\nsection (Parametric Consideration of Asteroid Capture),\nthese values are not critical to mission economics. Since\nthe primary effort of the mission is to expend moving\nmass out of the Earth\'s gravity well, the cost per kilogram of returned asteroidal material will increase only\nslightly if the delta V values are increased by 2 or\n3 km/sec. Nevertheless, the best opportunities should be\nidentified.\nTwo considerations strengthen the belief that considerably better missions than that shown in table 1 are\n\nTABLE 1.- RETRIEVAL MISSION TO 1977 HB\n(TOTAL MISSION TIME, 1974 DAYS)\nLocation\nEarth\n1977 HB\n1977 HB\nEarth\nVenus\nEarth\nEarth\n\n176\n\nOperation\nDepart high orbit\nArrive\nDepart\nFlyby\nFlyby\nFlyby\nHigh orbit arrival\n\nSMF\nORBIT\n\nDate\nApril 28, 1984\nNov. 28,1984\nJuly 1, 1985\nApril 15, 1987\nMarch 10, 1988\nAug. 29, 1988\nSept. 23, 1989\n\nDelta V required,\nkm/s\n6.32\n2.53\n2.04\n\n1.04\n1.5\n(lunar gravity\nassist)\n\npossible. Missions are found by trial and error and,\ntherefore, finding a good mission depends directly on\nhow many cases are\' considered. Time severely limited\nthe number of cases we analyzed; with more time, the\nstudy of known objects can be extended considerably.\nAn increased discovery rate for this type of object would\nincrease the number of good cases and should therefore\nbe pursued.\nGiven these caveats and uncertainties, we now\ndescribe the scenario. The retrieval of asteroidal material\nincludes the following steps: achieve a low-Earth orbit,\ntransfer to high-Earth orbit, lunar gravity assist and\ndeparture, intermediate gravity-assisted maneuvers, rendezvous operations, including despinning, mining, and\nprocessing operations; and mass-driver coupling and\ndeployment; and return. (Each step is described in detail\nin the following sections.)\n\nLow-Earth Orbit (LEO)\nComponents of the asteroid-retriever mass driver, fuel\nfor the outbound leg, and mining and processing equipment would be Shuttle-launched from Earth and the\ncomponent systems should be assembled and tested in\nlow-Earth orbit. If it is assumed that Shuttle payloads\nare arranged to be mass-limited rather than volumelimited, and if the Shuttle hydrogen tanks (30 metric\ntons) are used as mass-driver reaction mass, about\n55 metric tons may be lifted to 250-km-altitude orbit\nper launch. When the assembly and testing phases are\ncompleted, the crew is Shuttle-lifted to the waiting\nvehicle. This 21-man team would live in one or more\nShuttle hydrogen tanks similar in design to that envisioned for an early space habitat. Escape from near\nEarth space is achieved in two stages: first, with a\ndelta V of about 6.4 km/sec, the asteroid-retrieval package is raised to high-Earth orbit by a slow spiral orbit.\nThis stage requires 2 weeks to complete, using a mass\ndriver (or its equivalent) with an exhaust velocity of\n8 km/sec. The mass driver is optimized to place the\nasteroid retrieval package in suitable orbit for the minimum number of Shuttle flights, and ideally would be\nidentical to that designed for low-to-high Earth orbit\ntransport (ref. 4). Recent data provided by the MassDriver Group of this study, from conservative assumptions made about the component masses and length,\nindicate a total mass of 2500 tons at an acceleration of\n800 gravities. The propellant throughput is 4 kg/sec. The\ncrew and their life-support system have a mass of\n291 tons; the mining facility has a mass of 560 tons. A\n\ntotal outbound delta V of 9.4 km/sec requires the\nlaunch of 10,000 tons to low-Earth orbit. With an\nassumed return delta V of 5 km/sec and an asteroid\nfragment of 10 6 -ton mass, this enables 532,000 tons to\nbe brought to Earth orbit. The second departure phase\ninvolves a lunar gravity assist which gives a 1.5-km/sec\nescape velocity.\nGravity-Assisted Maneuvers\nBesides the lunar-gravity-assisted maneuver, other\npossible maneuvers permit a considerable saving in\ndelta-V requirements and hence in mass lifted to lowEarth orbit. These are described in reference 7 and are\nsummarized as follows. Of the planets, only Earth and\nVenus are suitable for missions to Earth-approaching\nasteroids because the other planets are either too small\nor too far away. The low-thrust EGA technique uses the\nEarth alone and is therefore always available. After\nlaunch from Earth, the mass driver imparts a small\ndelta V to the system and causes it to reintersect the\nEarth with a higher relative velocity than that with\nwhich it departed. These times of close encounter with\nthe Earth offer excellent opportunities for crew rotation, about every 400 days, except during the trips to\nand from the asteroid. This relative velocity is changed\nin direction by the close Earth encounter, and the final\nSun-centered velocity may be altered greatly.\nThe second type of gravity-assisted maneuver, called\nVEGA, uses both Earth and Venus. The mission leaves\nEarth to intercept Venus. A close Venus encounter\nrotates the relative velocity vector and directs the\nretrieval package back to Earth. A second flyby of the\nEarth bends the relative velocity vector and the final\nSun-centered velocity may be greatly increased. The\nmass driver may improve conditions further by thrusting\nduring the Earth-Venus or the Venus-Earth passage. In\nall these ways, a considerable saving in delta V and thus\nin launch mass may accrue. The mission leg from the last\nplanetary encounter will probably require additional\nthrust to intercept Earth and will certainly require thrust\nto match orbital velocities. The return trip may use\nsimilar gravity-assisted maneuvers to further reduce\nthrust requirements.\nAsteroid Rendezvous Operation\nRendezvous with the asteroid includes the following\nevents (fig. 3): orbital matchings, fragmenting, despinning and bagging the asteroid, establishing the mining\nand processing operation, and packaging material for\n\n177\n\nVELOCITY\nMATCHING\n\nLANDING\n\nSEPARATION OF\nEQUATORIAL\nFRAGMENT\n\nDE-SPIN\n\nBAG\n\nESTABLISH\nMINING\nOPERATION\n\nFigure 3.- Rendezvous operations at the asteroid.\nreaction mass and for return. Orbital matching is\nachieved in about 1 day, with a total velocity change of\nabout 1 to 2 km/sec.\nAfter rendezvous, a small jeep will land on the pole\nand its crew will find a suitable fragment of the asteroid\nfor return to Earth. Tlus fragment, wluch will have a\nmass of approximately 10 6 metric tons, will be near the\nequator and will be separated from the asteroid by a\nsmall chemical explosion. The jeep will then land on the\ndetached mass and proceed to despin it. Asteroids rotate\nat different rates, but 4 revolutions/day may be considered representative of asteroids in the 100-m-diameter\nsize range. A jeep will land at the pole of the fragment\nand establish a line of small Y-shaped pylons around its\nequator (fig. 4). These pylons will be either driven into\nSPIN AXIS\n\njeep with a very nlinimal velocity to just escape the weak\nfield of the asteroid would result in the cable being\nunwound as the asteroid rotates. A very tiny thrust from\nthe jeep would be required to keep a light tension on the\ncable (a few Newtons), which would have a minimal\neffect on the despin operation. After 2 days, the cable\nwill be unwound and will start to rewind in the other\ndirection. The jeep will thrust against this with 34 N for\n4 days (fig. 4). For an exhaust velocity of 4 km/sec,\n29 tons of propellant will be used to des pin the asteroid\ncompletely. Cable and pilons will be stored for return.\nAfter despinning, the asteroid fragment will be\nbagged along with the entire processing plant. The bag is\na slightly pressurized covering constructed of I-mm composite material resembling fiberglas plastic-coated to\nmake it gas-tight. This bag, with a volume of 10 6 m 3 ,\ncontains debris and gas produced by mining and processing operations and keeps the surrounding region clean.\nThe asteroid fragment itself is surrounded by a net of\n1 km 2 area composed of O.S-cm aluminum cable spaced\n1 m apart. This net will be preassembled and can be\nrolled out quickly by the crew. The net distributes the\nthrust loads over the asteroid surface and must be able\nto withstand the 32 tons of thrust developed by the\nmass driver. The total mass of the bag and net is\n160 tons. The mass driver is now broUght alongside the\nasteroid and coupled to the net. Considerable adjusting\nwill be required to ensure that the mass driver thrusts\nthrough the center of mass of the system. Care must be\ntaken in processing the asteroid during return so as not\nto misalign the thrust by shifting the center of mass.\n\nMining and Processing Operations\n\n"\'..1- - - -200 m---I~I\nFigure 4.- De-spinning an asteroid.\nthe asteroid (if it is firm enough) or held in place by\nsome kind of anchor.

The design requirements for the\nnlining and processing equipment will depend on the\ncharacter of the asteroidal material being used (ref. 8).\nThree possible types of material containing abundant\nvolatile and/or free metal phases are listed in table 2.\nIn this scenario, a metal-rich carbonaceous material is\nconsidered to be the most desirable material to recover.\nWe also assume that the metals (Ni Fe) and volatiles are\nsufficiently valuable to justify the extra steps necessary\nto extract or concentrate these materials. There are six\nmajor processing steps to follow between the raw asteroidal material and its use as reaction mass in a mass\ndriver: mining, crushing, and sizing; metal extraction and\n\nMETAL\nEXTRACTION\nAND STORAGE\n\nCRUSHING\nAND\nSIZING\n\nf----\n\nMINING\n\nMASS\nDRIVER\n\nI-\n\n!----\n\nDUST\n~\nFABRICATION\n\nVOLATILE\nEXTRACTION\nAND STORAGE\n\nGAS/DUST\nSEPARATION\n\nFigure 5.- Mining operations.\nTABLE 2.- MINERALOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THREE POSSIBLE\nASTEROIDAL MATERIALS\nType\n\nMetal-rich\nMatrix\xc2\xb7rich\ncarbonaceous carbonaceous\n(~C2f\n\nFe c (metal)\nNi (metal)\nCo (metal)\nC\nH2 O\nS\nFeO\nSi0 2\nMgO\nAI 20 3\nNa20\nK20\nP20S\nMinerals\n\np(g/cm 3 )\nMetal grain\nsize\nStrength\n\n10.7\n1.4\n.11\n1.4\n5.7\n1.3\n15.4\n33.8\n23.8\n2.4\n.55\n.04\n.28\n\n(~Cl.C2)b\n\nType 3\xc2\xb74,\nL\xc2\xb7H chondrite\n\n~O.1\n\n6\xc2\xb719\n1-2\n\n...\n.--\n\n~0.1\n~.3\n\n1.9\xc2\xb73.0\n\n~.15\n\n~12\n~2\n\n~1.5\n\n22\n28\n20\n2.1\n\n~10\n\n38\n24\n2.1\n\n~.3\n\n.9\n.1\n.28\n\n.04\n.23\n\nClay mineral\nmatrix\nMg Olivine\nwith FeO\ninclusions\n\nClay mineral\nmatrix\nOlivine\n\nOlivene\nPyroxene\nMetal\n\n3.3\n\n2.0-2.8\n\n3.5-3.8\n\n~.2 mm\nModerately\nfriable\n\n----0.2 mm\nWeakModerately\nmoderately\nfriable\nfriable\n\naData from metal-rich C2 meteorite Renazzo.\nb Data from C2 meteorite Murchison and average\nC l-C2 types.\ncChemical analysis in weight percent.\n\nstorage; volatile extraction and storage; gas-dust separation; and dust fabrication for mass-driver use. Figure 6 is\na schematic diagram of the asteroid processor.\nThe physical situation at the asteroid requires special\ntypes of processing and handling. For an object in the\nmass range of interest, the surface gravity is about a few\nmicrogravities, which corresponds to a surface acceleration of some thousandths of a centimeter per second per\nsecond or a few tens of micrometers per second per\nsecond. Initial acceleration proposed for the mass-driver\nsystem is about 50/lm/sec 2 and increases as the body\nmass decreases. A body of this size in the solar system is\nalmost certainly a collisional fragment (or a portion of\none) and will be strength-limited by internal fractures. A\nrelatively simple netting arrangement should suffice to\nhold it together against the relatively small accelerations\ncontemplated. (This netting was described previously.)\n\nMining- The major problem in any mining scenario is\nto hold the cutting equipment against a surface with\nsufficient force to cut into the fragment. In tunneling\noperations, pressure can be exerted on the walls to\nprovide stabilization, but for fractured, realtively lowstrength rock, tunnels must be spaced to provide relatively thick walls (e.g., about 1 tunnel diameter), which\nlimits the usefulness of this technique, particularly if\nmuch of the material is to be used for reaction mass.\nAn alternate surface technique involves a covered flail\nexcavator that cuts a 5-m-wide, I-m-deep trench. This\nexcavator is held against the surface by anchor rods\ndriven into the ground around it; the excavator pulls\nitself forward with these anchors. The forward progress\nneeded to supply 4 kg/sec is about 0.03 cm/sec or about\n1.3 m/hr. This device delivers appropriately sized fragments (e.g., ~20 cm) through a pipe or conveyor system\nto the main processing facility.\nCrushing and sizing- Because the materials being\nconsidered are relatively soft, crushing them should be\nfairly easy. The crushing device used has a rocking jaw\narrangement for coarse crushing \xc2\xabI cm) and a series of\nrollers for fine crushing (fig. 7). The crushing elements\nare arranged radially in a rotating cylindrical housing to\nprovide a radial acceleration from the hub (input) to the\nfinal powder (~O.l gat 10 rpm of a 3-m-radius device).\nMean particle sizes of about 0.2 mm or slightly less are\ndesirable for metal extraction.\nMetal extraction and storage- After crushing, it is\nprobably desirable to use gasdynamic transport to move\nthe materials. Gas pressure can be quite low (~I millibar) and still be effective for transport in this low-gravity\n\n179\n\nSOLAR MIRROR\n\nASTEROID\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n(\'\n\nI\nI\n\nL\n\nI~\n\nI~\nI~\n\nIi\n(/)\n\nREACTION MASS\nSTORAGE TANK\n\nNiF.

A low gas pressure simplifies system construction since leak rates and material strength require\xc2\xb7\nments are minimized. The carrier gas could be either\nCO 2 or H2 0, both of which are available. Leakage into a\nmoderately contained environment (e.g., the surrounding processing facility) can be minimized by cold-trap\npumping in a passive mode.\nTo extract most of the metallic phase, the gas stream\nand its entrained dust are passed through a magnetic\nfield (fig. 8).

This enriched fraction (metal\nsand) will be diverted to a storage facility (large, relatively weak tank or bag). It is doubtful that any subsequent processing of this metal-rich phase would be economically feasible enroute.\nVolatile extraction and storage- To recover the volatile phases (H 20, CO 2 , hydrocarbons), the material must\nbe heated (fig. 9). The temperatures required depend on\nthe desired recovery rate. Water chemically bound into\nthe clay minerals of C l-C2 matrix material begins to\ncome off near 100\xc2\xb0 C and continues to come off until\nabout 400\xc2\xb0 C. Carbon dioxide is produced by the disassociation of hydrocarbon compounds and by reaction\n\nL\n~\n\nGAS (TO TANKS)\n\nFigure 9.- High temperature volatile extraction.\nof elemental carbon with oxide phases (e.g.,\nC + 2Fe203 ~ CO 2 + 4FeO). Hydrocarbons volatilize or\nbreak down in the range 100\xc2\xb0-700\xc2\xb0 C, releasing a\nvariety of compounds, including methane and\npetroleumlike vapors.\nThe energy requirements depend on the recovery\nrate, which is dominated by the heat of vaporization of\nwater. Considering the various heat capacities of the\nphases, about 200 cal/g are required to raise raw C2\ncarbonaceous matrix material to about 700\xc2\xb0 C and to\nvaporize the volatile components. A 4-kg/sec throughput\nwould require a solar collector about 60 m on a side\nfocused on a collector area about 6 m across. Dust\nentrained in a carrier gas (-2-10 kg/m 3 ) is introduced\ninto a heat-exchange system at the mirror focus for a\nperiod of 30-60 sec. The dust is separated from the gas\nby a cyclonic separation (dust settles rapidly to the\nouter wall of a curved conduit). Counterflow of gas and\ndust is used to heat incoming stream and cool outgoing\nstream. The gas stream is directed to a shaded heat\nexchanger and into a storage tank that also serves as a\nheat exchanger. To condense all products to -200 K, a\n\n181\n\nradiator area must be about 100 m on a side. The heat\nreleased by condensing water may limit the total volatile\nrecovery program. A double condenser system may solve\nsome of this difficulty; the first tank operates near\n250 K and precipitates much of the H 2 0 (depending on\nvapor pressure) and hydrocarbons. A second tank operating near 150 K and at slightly elevated pressure condenses the remaining H2 0 and CO 2 vapors (see fig. 10).\nThe metallic sand is stored in both tanks to increase the\nthermal conductivity of the ices.\n\n\'"\n\nz\nq:\nt,\nSTORAGE TANKS! ~\nCONDENSERS!\n;::\nRADIATORS\nq:\'\n\n1i\nq:\na:\n150 K\n\n250 K\nDARK SKY (-5 K)\n\n!\nFigure 10.- Radiatively cooled volatile storage tanks.\nThe recovery of volatiles is likely to be limited by the\nability to radiate away the heat of condensation of the\nvolatile phases for reasonable tank/radiator mass. In the\nshade, radiating to a dark sky, an optimum value can be\nevaluated.\nDust fabrication for the mass driver- The dust fraction of the cooled product is delivered to a storage tank,\nthen to either the mass-driver loading point or to a\ncentral fabricating facility. The dust is separated from\nthe entraining gas and is stamped or poured into appropriate molds. The character of these mold requirements\nis presently unspecified. However, laboratory experience\nhas shown that relatively low pressures are required to\nform a reasonably solid pellet.\nMass Requirements for Mining, Processing,\nand Storage\nThe cost of feasibility of mining and processing an\nasteroid for reaction mass, volatiles, and metals will\ndepend greatly on the mass and associated costs of\ntransporting equipment to the asteroid to accomplish\n\n182\n\nthese tasks. The necessary equipment includes that for\nmining and processing (crushers, metal and volatile\nextractors), storage containers, radiators, and support\nequipment (piping, blowers, "nets," and "bags"). An\ninitial estimate of the mass of the necessary equipment\ncan be made by fixing a preliminary design for each\ncomponent and by then making a reasonable estimate as\nto the mass of that component. Certain elements of the\nproposed system are sized to a particular mass-flow rate.\nEach component is discussed briefly below and its associated mass is estimated.\nReaction-mass storage and "pumping" facilities\ninclude the system needed to store and feed reaction\nmass for the outbound leg (analogous to a fuel tank).\nFor a throughput of 4 kg/sec, this tank must have a\nstorage capacity of about 20,000 m 3 and is envisioned as\na gas-tight (~I mbar pressure) bag, 20 m in diameter and\n65 m long, opening slightly "downward" with a gasagitated grating at the bottom. The bag material is\nassumed to be a composite (canvas and plastic or appropriate substitute of mass 3.75 kg/m2, e.g., 5-mm-thick\ncomposite or 2.5-mm-thick aluminum) with a mass of\n25 tons. Gasdynamic transport using blowers (five\nblowers at 2 tons each with motor), composite pipes\n(about 1 km, 7 kg/m 2 , and with a 2-m diameter weighing about 22 tons), and a gas-dust separator and bucket\nloader (about 4 tons and 10 tons, respectively). Such a\nstructure would have a mass of about 71 tons, and if we\napply a safety factor, the estimate is 120 tons.\n"Big bag" is a slightly pressured gas-tight covering for\nan entire work area (1 mm of composite), which\nencloses a volume of 10 6 m3 and has a mass of about\n60 tons. The asteroid is enclosed and suspended in a net\n(1 km 2 of 0.5-cm aluminum cable at I-m spacing weighing about I 00 tons).\nThe mass of the processing equipment corresponds\nwith the throughput of material. The 50-kg/sec mass\nflow, considered the maximum case, is discussed here.\n(For other mass-flow rates, estimates are provided\nbelow.) The equipment includes: miners (three at\n50 tons), crushers (two at 75 tons), a magnetic separator\n(10 tons), blowers (five at 2 tons), volatile extraction\nbaker and mirror (200 tons), and volatile storage and\nradiators (two at 350 tons). The total mass requirements\ndepend on throughput as given below: 0 kg/sec,\n300 tons; 4 kg/sec, 560 tons; 10 kg/sec, 650 tons; and\n50 kg/sec, 1500 tons.\n\nAlternatives to the Mass Driver\nOf any presently known system, the mass-driver concept allows an asteroid mission to return to Earth orbit\nwith the largest amount of material. But other devices\nare available that could also return large quantities of\nmaterial. For any asteroid recovery mission, it may be\npreferable to process the material where it is obtained\nand to bring only the most valuable portion back to\nEarth. The disadvantage of a longer waiting time at the\nasteroid may be more than compensated for if processing the asteroid in situ allows either a faster manned\nreturn or the use of a propulsion system that can be\nfully automated. We have indicated that establishing\nmachinery to process volatiles and free metals at the\nasteroid does not impose severe economic penalties.\nTwo schemes suggest themselves for the return flight:\na rocket that uses either water or volatized rock as a\nworking fluid and the solar sail. Solar power could\nconvert water from a carbonaceous asteroid into liquid\nhydrogen and liqUid oxygen by electrolysis. LH z and\nLOX would then be used as fuel and oxidizer in a\nlow-thrust rocket engine that has an extended operating\ntime. Although this is a roundabout way to extract\npropulsion energy from sunlight, the very high efficiency\nof the electrolysis makes it feasible. The conversion\nprocess would be continuous throughout the return\nflight, a factor that might enable the return mission to\nbe entirely automated. To avoid the use of large cryogenic storage tanks, the rocket motor would, ideally,\nalso operate continuously on the return flight. This\nintroduces the complication of a long-thrusting rocket\nmotor that uses LH z and LOX, but the mass of the\nrocket motor is negligible compared to either conversion\nsystem or payload so that several could be used\nsequentially.\nAn in-house General Dynamics study (E. Bock,\nConvair Division, personal communication, 1977) provided the basic figures for the electrolysis and refrigeration plant. It was assumed that, excluding this plant, the\nmass of the supporting structures and the rocket motor\nand its subsidiary systems would not together exceed\n300 tons. This latter figure appears reasonable since, if\nthe payload is stored in the shadow of the solar collector, it will be solid condensate and should not require\nan elaborate bracing system to transfer the modest\nthrust to it. The exhaust velocity, taking into account\nvarious losses, is assumed to be 4400 m/sec and all\nmissions have a I-year return time. The exhaust velocity\nis compatible with low delta-V mission requirements_\nThis type of rocket is well configured for a water-\n\nretrieval nusslOn. Changing the mission time directly\nalters the thrust and collector area requirements, but has\nonly a secondary effect on the mass of the system itself.\nProcessing rates are assumed constant for both outbound\nand return legs and therefore the thrust, but the rocket\noperates only during a portion of the outbound leg.\nSince a conventional rocket may be started or stopped\neasily, this requirement for noncontinuous thrust on the\noutbound leg presents no serious complication.\nCollector area is based on an assumed 10-percent\nsolar collector efficiency and a 95-percent electrolysis\nefficiency. Both are reasonable, and the pOSSibility of\nusing germanium solar cells with a sunlight concentrator\ninstead of silicon may make the first figure conservative.\nCollector areas and power requirements are moderate\nand thrust requirements may be fulfilled with very small\nengines. For equivalent delta-V values up to 8 km/sec,\nthe mission returns more mass from the asteroid than it\nused to reach the asteroid. This is necessary if the\nreturned material is primarily water but is desirable in\nany case. All scenarios ass ume a ret urn payload of\n104 tons of water. For low equivalent delta V values, the\nmass of water in high Earth orbit may be multiplied\nmany times by this device. The same scenario as presented alone is used here - an outbound delta V of\n3 km/sec from high-Earth orbit and a return delta V of\n5 km/sec from the asteroid. Power supply and electrolysis plant scales inversely with mission return time. For a\n2-year return flight, the solar rocket fully fueled in\nhigh-Earth orbit has a mass of 2084 tons. The rocket has\na mass of 1054 tons, 463 tons of which are the power\nsupply and electrolysis plant and 291 tons are the crew\nand their life-support system. The remaining mass is a\nprocessing plant for extracting water and other derived\nmass from the asteroid. For continuous operation, the\npower requirement is a modest 19 MW. For the return\ntrip in this non mass-driver scenario, an initial mass of\n33,000 tons results in 10,000 tons brought to high Earth\norbit, a tenfold increase in the mass of fuel used for the\noutbound journey.\nA second alternative to the mass driver, one that\nfurther reduces the mass brought to Earth by a factor of\n10 but which could more easily be automated, is the\nsolar sail. This device consists of a very large mirror of\nthin metal foil or a microlayer of metal or plastic; it\nrelies on solar radiation pressure - caused by momentum transfer at reflection - for propulsion. Although\nthe maximum force available at Earth orbit is only\n9.3 N/km2, the need for propellant has been eliminated.\nThe recent development of new sail material with\nlightness ratios (ratio of solar radiation pressure to solar\n\n183\n\ngravitational force) of 5 or more has returned the solar\nsail to consideration for low to moderate delta-V lowthrust missions. The lightness ratio is constant regardless\nof distance from the Sun.\nIt is assumed that the structural mass excluding the\nsail is 10 percent of the returned payload. If a\nWOO-met ric-ton (10 6 kg) payload must be returned and\nif it is assumed that 38 percent of perpendicular thrust\ncan be used, lightness ratios of 5 and 1 both yield\nsatisfactory results. For most missions, the sail area\nde pends very little on sail lightness ratio and therefore\nthe sail area can be varied inversely with mission time.\nFor the specific scenario used previously, a 2-year\nreturn time requires a 22.7 -km 2 sail area and a sail mass\nof 7.2 tons for a sail lightness ratio of 5, and a 23.4-km 2\nsail area and a sail mass of 37 tons for a sail lightness\nratio of 1. In both cases, 1000 tons of material may be\nbrought to Earth orbit. If these devices are automated, a\nfleet of these may be launched from a suitable asteroid\nand later retrieved near Earth. While the mass driver\npromises to be very useful in returning large quantities\nof asteroid material to Earth orbit, it is not crucial to\nsuch a mission. Either alternative presented here appears\nfeasible and there are surely other possibilities. The solar\n\nrocket hybrid is within reach of current technology,\nwhile the solar sail is not far beyond it.\n\nPARAMETRIC CONSIDERATIONS OF\nASTEROID CAPTURE\nThe estimated masses of an asteroid mining vehicle\nsized to capture a 10 6 -ton asteroid are shown in\nfigure 11 as a function of mass-driver exhaust velocity.\nAs exhaust velocity increases, the mass-driver mass\nincreases sharply because of increasing power requirements, while the mass of the mining system including\npersonnel accommodations decreases more slowly\nbecause the reaction mass throughput decreases.\nIt is postulated that the asteroid can be captured by a\nSingle-stage mining vehicle starting from LEO, which\nattaches to the asteroid and returns with it to far Earth\norbit. The required start mass in LEO is shown in\nfigure 12 as a function of exhaust velocity for a typical\nmission requiring ideal velocity gain on the outbound\ntrip of 9.4 km/sec (6.4 km/sec for escape and 3.0 km/sec\nfor transit and rendezvous maneuvers) and 3.0 km/sec\non the return trip. Since, in the range of feasible exhaust\n\n(SIZED FOR 106 metric tons ASTEROIDI\n\n~VOUT\n\n= 9.4 km/sec\n\n~vBACK\n\n= 3.0 km/sec\n5r-------,------------------------,\n\n25\n\n100\n\n4\n20\n\n80\n\n1\n\n15\n\n"\n\n.~\n\n"\n""\n"\n\nE\nN\n\nS!\n/\n\n,.\n\n..... .....\n\n..........\n\n~\n\n...\n\n\xc2\xab\n\'"\n\n-"\n\nIII\n\xc2\xab\nIi;\n\n60\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n~\n\n0\n\nw\n\n\'"\n...\n::>\n\n""\n\n40\n\n~\n\nu\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n20\n\n/\nI\n\n5\n\n/\nI\n\nI\n\n/\n\n0\n4\n6\n8\nEXHAUST VELOCITY. 103 m/sec\n\n468\nEXHAUST VELOCITY. 103 m/_\n\n10\n\nFigure 11.- Effects of exhaust velocity on asteroid\nmining vehicle mass.\n\n184\n\nc.

For this value, the captured mass\nis 0.535X 10 6 tons.\nThe sensitivity of LEO start mass and capture - the\nstart mass ratio - to variations in outbound and return\nvelocity requirements is shown in figure 13. Note that\nthe post-escape outbound velocity requirement doubles,\nbut there is no more than about a 45-percent increase in\nLEO start mass and a corresponding decrease in capture\nmass. Also, a 67 -percent increase in return velocity\nrequirement produces only a 21-percent reduction of\ncapture to start mass ratio. Therefore, it can be concluded that a comfortable range of potential asteroid\norbits can be accommodated without severe losses.\nFigure 14(a) is a schematic of the asteroid capture\nmission; it also includes a parametric cost equation\nexpressing total program costs per kilogram of asteroid\ncaptured. Also shown for comparison is a similar expression for the corresponding costs of terrestrial material.\nIn the terrestrial case, it is postulated that the material is\nprocured on Earth, transported to LEO, and then carried\nto geosynchronous orbit by the same mass driver as used\nin the asteroid case, which subsequently returns itself to\nLEO to pick up another cargo.

Several observations were made:\n1. For capture of a 10 6 -ton asteroid, estimated total\nprogram costs are from $12-14 billion or about $24/kg\nof captured mass. If RDT & E are excluded, the captured mass cost reduces to about $4/kg. These values\nassume up-rated Shuttle as the Earth-to-LEO transporter, with transportation costs of $240/kg.\n2. These results are only moderately sensitive to\nEarth-to-LEO transportation cost and reaction mass cost\nbecause of the relatively high RDT & E and hardware\nprocurement costs.\n3. Delivery to geosynchronous orbit (GSO) of a total\nmass of terrestrial materials equal to the asteroid capture\nmass would involve, on the same basis of comparison, a\ntotal program cost of about $663 billion and a delivered\ncost/kilogram of about $355/kg, including RDT & E\ncosts ($343/kg, excluding RDT & E costs).\n4. If the asteroid mass were increased, RDT & E and\nprocurement costs would increase somewhat, but capture mass would increase proportionately with asteroid\nmass, resulting in significant reductions in cost/kg captured. Thus for a 10 6 -ton asteroid, cost/kg captured\nmight be reduced to about 50\xc2\xa2/kg.\n5. While support operations costs are not considered\nhere, it seems likely that their magnitudes relative to the\ncosts considered would be similar for both cases, and not\ndominant.\n= 9.4 km/sec\n= 5.0 km/sec\nEX.

This preliminary parametric assessment confirms\nsuggestions that asteroids may be promising sources of\nmaterials for support of space activities on a growing\nscale in the future, and that this possibility should\nreceive increased attention.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nThe present study has determined that, through the\ntechniques of multiple gravity assists by the Earth,\nMoon, and Venus, the total one-way delta V from Earth\nescape (or capture) to rendezvous (depart from) existing\nasteroids, in favorable cases, is from 2 to 4 km/sec. The\nmission analysis described here indicates that a singlestage, low-Earth orbit to asteroid mass driver with an\nexhaust velocity of about 8 km/sec may be the most\ncost-effective alternative. Minimizing delta V in the outbound leg of the mission was found to be more important than minimizing inbound delta V, in terms of the\namount of Earth-launched mass required to perform the\nretrieval mission. A large delta V for the inbound leg\n(e.g., 5-8 km/sec) increases the mass of the mining\noperation to prepare reaction mass, thereby reducing the\namount of asteroidal material retrievable, but has no\nsignificant bearing on the total mass required to start the\nmission in low-Earth orbit, which appears to be the\nmajor cost driver. But a modest increase in the delta V\nof the outbound leg to values up to 6 km/sec from\nescape would not impose severe penalties. Therefore,\nthere are mission opportunities to existing targets that\ncan be immediately investigated. Further refinements of\nmission-analysis techniques for known objects will\npermit a more precise determination of known opportunities. In addition, opportunities will arise as the\nnumber of known objects increases appreciably over the\ncoming years.\nThe total asteroid-retrieving mass consists of the mass\ndriver, mining equipment, and reaction mass for the\nboost. In the range of delta V values likely to be encountered, the total mass required for launch to low-Earth\norbit to retrieve about half of a 106-ton asteroid is near\n10,000 tons, similar to the lunar case. During the mid-tolate 1980\'s, a cost of about $2 billion, this magnitude of\nmass could be launched by an upgraded (class II) Shuttle\nwith the external tanks used as reaction mass. Development costs (about $10 billion) would dominate and\nwould be absorbed in subsequent, larger-scale asteroidal\nretrievals. Alternatively, reaction mass could become\navailable in low-Earth orbit in the form of lunar materials obtained in an early, modest program of lunar\nmining (ref. 4).\n\nPerhaps the most unique aspect of retrieving asteroidal materials is the availability of large quantities of\nvolatiles (water and carbon compounds) and free metals.\nThese materials may not be available in large quantities\non the Moon. Since about 30,000 tons of consumables\nare required for space settlements that support the construction of satellite power stations, most of these consumables preferably could come from the asteroids\nrather than from Earth. Moreover, free metals separated\nat the asteroid and alloyed at the space-manufacturing\nfacility (SMF) into useful structures may eliminate many\nof the complex chemical processing steps required in the\nlunar case.\nMuch of the 500,000 tons of asteroidal material that\nwould arrive at the SMF could be water and carbon if a\ntype I or II carbonaceous object at a low to moderate\ndelta V could be discovered. It is possible that the Earthapproaching asteroid Betulia is carbonaceous, and statistical considerations suggest that such a discovery, in an\nexpanded search and followup program, is probable at\nsome time over the next few years (ref. 8). Such an\nobject would obviously be a prime target for a precursor\nmission.\nThe retrieval of asteroidal materials for space manufacturing appears to be cost-competitive and contemporary with the retrieval of lunar materials, and considerably less expensive than transporting consumables from\nthe Earth if a type I or II carbonaceous object with\nreasonably favorable delta-V characteristics could be\nfound. Therefore, the asteroid option for space manufacturing should be kept open. We recommend that the\nfollowing studies and programs be carried out immediately to better assess the details of this option:\n1. Continued studies of retrieval mission opportunities: Late in this study, we recognized that gravity assists\nin a low-thrust mission significantly reduce the mass\nrequirements and that the delta V in the outbound leg\nshould be minimized; also the economics of asteroid\nretrieval are not severely affected for moderate delta V\nvalues (one way, about 6 km/sec). From an analysis of\nthe asteroid 1977 HB, the inbound delta V was found in\none case to be from 2-3 km/sec. Many more casesand a scheme for selecting the best ones - must be\nstudied. Several known candidate asteroids can be\nstudied over the next few years, and new ones as they\nare discovered.\n2. Increased asteroid search and followup program:\nThe current inventory of 39 Earth-approaching asteroids\nwhose orbits are known can be increased appreciably\nwith a modest investment in dedicated Earth-based telescopes and perhaps orbital telescopes. The followup\n\nwork of orbital determination and chemical analysis is\nalso important. Such an inventory would identify carbonaceous objects with low-to-moderate delta-V\nopportuni ties.\n3. Precursor missions: Because of the potential\nimportance of obtaining volatiles - and possibly free\nmetals - from asteroids, clearly, a precursor mission to\nthe prime carbonaceous candidate(s) is paramount. Such\na mission is also important to assess mineralOgical structure for designing the mining and processing apparatus.\nWe recommend a new start in the NASA budget aimed\ntoward single- or multiple-asteroid rendezvous and landing missions that would answer these questions for one\nor more objects between 1982 and 1985.\n4. Continuing studies of the potentials of asteroidal\nretrieval: These studies would continue to assess the\ntrade-offs between the retrieval of asteroidal, lunar, and\nEarth materials for space manufacturing in the light of\nnew information as it comes in.\n5. Technology support: Design concepts of asteroidretriever mass drivers and mining and processing equipment must be further developed; technology development milestones must be established in parallel with the\nlunar option.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nPRELIMINARY COMPARISON OF ESTIMATED\nCOSTS FOR ASTEROIDAL AND LUNAR\nMATERIALS\n\nRobert Salkeld\nTo estimate a common-based comparison of asteroidal and lunar materials costs, both are here placed on\nthe same program basis as assumed for the lunar case\n(ref. 9). That is, Earth launches are assumed to begin in\n1985 using the first generation space shuttle (capacity 60 flights/yr), phasing in 1987 to a shuttle-derivative\nheavy-lift vehicle (SD/HLV) for unmanned cargo (capacity - 80 flights/yr), and finally phasing in 1991 to a\nsecond generation passenger-cargo single-stage-to-orbit\n(SSTO) shuttle. Program duration is 10 years\n(1985-1994), during which about 1 million tons of\nasteroid material (from the capture of two I-million-ton\nasteroids) are returned to the space manufacturing facility (SMF), compared with about 2.4 million tons of\nlunar materials.\n\n187\n\nCapture of two asteroids in this time period is based\non the estimate of as-year out-and-back mission time,\nand is consistent with the maximum-paced program\nassumed for the lunar case_ Thus, the first generation\nshuttle launches the asteroid miner and mass driver in\nsections during 1985-86, contributing in the process all\nof its external tanks for mass-driver reaction mass. The\nSD/HVL then phases in to launch a second miner and\nmass driver, and all the remaining reaction mass for two\nasteroid expeditions as well as chemical orbital transfer\nvehicles (OTV) and their propellants for establishing the\nSMF, during 1987-89. The first expedition leaves lowEarth orbit (LEO) early in 1987 and returns in 1992.\nWhen it has successfully reached its target and is homeward bound 1989, the second leaves to return in 1994.\nThe SD/HVL, SSTO and OTV establish the SMF in\n1989-92 so that it is ready to process the first returning\nasteroid. The chemical OTV is used for SMF rather than\na smaller mass driver, to avoid a second mass driver\ndevelopment program, and because the OTV is required\nin any case for SMF personnel transfer. Use of a mass\ndriver for deploying SMF would reduce total program\ncost only slightly.\nThe results of preliminary costing of the asteroid and\nlunar programs are summarized in table 3. A possible\nrequirement for an LEO station has been included as one\n\nconsideration, to maintain as comparable basis as possible with the lunar case. Several observations may be\nmade:\n1. Costs of asteroidal materials are higher in table 3\nthan in figure 15 because of inclusion of the SMF and\nhigher cost launch vehicles in the program, to be more\ncomparable with the lunar case.\n2. Costs of asteroidal materials are not sensitive to\nthe requirement for an LEO station, since its development, deployment and resupply costs are small in the\ntotal picture.\n3. The total program cost for the asteroid option is\nonly about half that of the lunar case including nonrecurring research, development, test and engineering\n(RDT & E) costs; it is only about one-third that of the\nlunar case if RDT & E costs are excluded.\n4. Cost per delivered kg of material is 10-20 percent\nhigher for asteroid materials if RDT & E are included,\nbut 25-30 percent lower than lunar materials on a\nrecurring cost basis. Reasons for this are the relatively\nhigh RDT & E costs, but the lower amount of massdriver throughput for the same delivered mass, for the\nasteroid than the lunar case. In addition, the asteroid\noperation is not burdened with the establishment and\noperation of anything akin to the mass-catcher or lunar\norbit facilities and lOgistics.\n\nTABLE 3.- SUMMARY OF ASTEROIDAL AND LUNAR\nMATERIALS COSTS (10-YEAR PROGRAM-1985-1994)\n\n~\nCosts\n\nstation\nreq\'d?\n\nAsteroidal,\n1.1 X 106 tons delivered\nto SMF\n\nLunar,\n2.4X 10 6 tons\nto SMF\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nRDT&E\nincluded\n\n27.7\n\n31.2\n\n57.0\n\nRDT&E\nexcluded\n\n11.9\n\n12.6\n\n37.0\n\nRDT&E\nincluded\n\n25.2\n\n28.4\n\n23.8\n\nRDT&E\nexcluded\n\n10.8\n\n11.5\n\n1975 $\n\nTotal\nprogram,.\n$ billions\n\nPer kg\ndelivered,\n$/kg\n\n188\n\n15.4\n\n5. These results suggest that for comparable or better\neconomics in terms of cost per kilogram delivered, the\nasteroid option is significantly more attractive than the\nlunar option in terms of front-end "price of admission."\nThe relative attractiveness of the asteroid option would\nof course be further strengthened if asteroidal material\ncompositions are found more favorable than those of\nlunar materials.\nREFERENCES\n1.

GAFFEY, ELEANOR F. HELIN,and BRIAN O\'LEARY\n\nThe very large number of small asteroids in near-Earth space provide many opportunities to transfer material to the\nEarth-Moon system at low cost. On the basis of remote-sensing evidence and meteorite studies, a substantial fraction of\nthese objects should contain abundant volatile (water, carbon, carbon compounds) and/or free metal (nickel-iron)\nmaterials. Although there are only about 40 known Earth-approaching asteroids, this number could be increased by at\nleast an order of magnitude in a few years by a dedicated search program with a large telescope (48-in. Schmidt). A\ndiscovery rate of 20 objects/yr could be expected from a facility costing about $3 million to establish.\nThe material these objects contain should be determined, if possible, during the discovery opposition, because of\ntheir long synodic periods. Relatively high-resolution, broad-wavelength coverage (0.3-2.0 f.1m) reflectance spectra\ncould be made for many of these objects with a large (~lOO in.) telescope and instruments under development. Such\nspectra are necessary for detailed mineralogic, characterizations of these asteroids. Low-resolution survey spectra with\nsimilar wavelength coverage (UBVRIJHK filters) would provide useful characterizations of fainter objects.\nA spacecraft mission should be planned to one or more of these asteroids. Support for programs to \'oc:ate and characterize the near-Earth asteroids is essential to any program of large-scale space operations since asteroidal bodies\nappear to be the least expensive source of certain needed raw materials.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn addition to the four terrestrial planets and the\nMoon, a very large number of minor objects, ranging in\nsize from single dust motes to bodies more than 10 km\nin diameter, are present in the inner solar system. A\nsmall fraction of these asteroids follow orbits that intersect the Earth\'s orbit, and when collisions occur,\nmeteors, meteorites, and impact craters result (depending on the size of the object).\nThese asteroids may offer the nearest (in terms of\nenergy) source of raw materials, certainly the nearest\nbeyond the Moon, for any large-scale space activities.\nThe suitability of these asteroids as a resource base will\ndepend on (1) what types of needed materials are available, (2) how the material can be transferred in a useful\nform to the required area, and (3) how many of these\nobjects have orbits favorable for efficient transfer.\nThis paper evaluates the potential resources available\namong the Apollo-Amor objects (those asteroids that\ncross or approach the Earth\'s orbit). The orbital distribu-\n\ntion of the known Apollo-Amor objects (about 40) and\nof the expected popUlation (about 200,000 with diameters greater than 100 m) are discussed from both empirical (i.e., observation) and theoretical perspectives.\nSeveral programs aimed at locating these bodies are\noutlined, and their relative cost and discovery rate\ndiscussed.\nThe chemical and physical nature of these bodies can\nbe deduced from an analysis of remote-sensing data,\nfrom analysis of meteorites, and from a study of their\nsource regions. A program of telescopic and spacecraft\nobservations to determine the chemical composition and\nphysical characteristics of these objects is outlined. The\ntransfer (delta V) requirements for several members of\nthe Apollo-Amor population were investigated in a separate paper (ref. 1). A scenario for moving a\n10 6 -1 0 7 -metric-ton portion of such an object into\nEarth-Moon space and the requirements for such a transfer were investigated in a second companion paper\n(ref. 2).\n\n191\n\nAPOLLO ASTEROID ORBITS AND\nPOPULATIONS\nIn trod ucti on\nThe distribution of asteroids in general and of the\nApollo-Amor group in particular can be determined\nfrom either observational or theoretical considerations.\nThe distribution of known asteroids as a function of\ndistance from the Sun (semimajor axis a) is shown in\nfigure 1. Between 1.8 and 3.5 AU (asteroid belt), this\ndistribution is probably a reasonable representation of\nthe actual distribution, subject to corrections for observational bias against the more distant and lower albedo\n(fainter) objects in the outer asteroid belt (ref. 3).\nThe population of known objects with a semimajor\naxis <1.6 AU (mostly Apollo-Amor objects) is probably\nnot representative of the population as a whole because\nof the small number of known objects (about 40)\nand because of observational selection effects that have\nfavored the discovery of certain types of objects.\nIncreasing the number of known Apollo objects to several hundred in a systematic search program will provide\na secure basis for evaluating population patterns and for\nidentifying the most suitable bodies for material return.\nBased on the discovery rate of Apollo objects in three\nsystematic search programs, it is estimated that the\nnumber of bodies larger than 1 km should be 800 \xc2\xb1 400\n\nl:\nt-\n\na:\n\xc2\xab\nW\n\na:\n\'"\n\xc2\xab\n~\n\n.\n\n~\n\nN\n\nI\n\n50\n"\'...J\n\n9<\n0>\na: a:\n\nww\n\nt- t-\n\n~~\n~\n\nffi\n\nzOo.\n\n~\n\nNM\n\nc:l\n\nI I\n\n.,\n\nIII\n\nM N\n\nI\n\nI\n\nHistory and Discovery Circumstances of\nApollo Asteroids\nMax Wolf, who had actively pursued a photographic\nsearch of asteroids at Heidelberg during the first three\ndecades of the twentieth century, was succeeded by Karl\nReinmuth.

Elements of the current ApolloAmor group were provided by Williams (personal communication, 1977).\n\n192\n\nsystematic programs were started: one at Mt. Palomar,\nthe National Geographic Sky Survey (1949 - 1965), and\nthe other, the Lick Observatory Proper Motion Survey.\nAs by-products of these two surveys, several more\nApollo asteroids were discovered. It should be understood that any asteroid trails found on these plates were\nconsidered undesirable, flawing the otherwise acceptable\nphotographic plate. It was primarily the diligence of\ncertain individuals, who were sufficiently intrigued by\nthe long trails, that led to recovery and followup of the\nnew objects.\nAfter these two surveys were completed, there was\nanother lull in discovery activity. From the early 1950s\nthrough the early 1970s, four other Apollo objects were\nfound incidentally in other observational programs. The\nfirst systematic search for Earth-crossing asteroids was\ninitiated in 1973 using the 46-cm (18-in .) Schmidt at\nMt. Palomar. The results of this ongoing study have been\nthe discovery of four Apollos, five Mars crossers, and\nanother dozen asteroids from inner regions of the main\nbelt. Figure 2 shows the discovery plate for one of the\nApollo objects (1976 AA).\nThis dedicated program has had an influence on other\nobservers in the astronomical community. By acquainting other observers (particularly the regular observers\nusing the 122 cm (48-in.) Schmidt) with the nature and\nrationale of the search program and its significance,\nanother four Apollos have been discovered . It should be\npointed out that, before the 46-cm Schmidt planetcrossing asteroid search, these asteroid trails were\nignored. These observers, with a better understanding of\nthe importance of reporting these trailed objects , have\nbeen responsible for doubling the total n umber of\nApollo asteroids discovered in the last 4 years.\n\n"-1"1\n..\n... \'.-:~.. *\',\\ ,;:... ,~.... \' :.r, :,..-" \',.\xe2\x80\xa2~._. ....... ..:\n." . . .;,..,. -\'.to .\';\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xb7""\xc2\xb7 \xc2\xb7t:\':\n.....\n: ......\n~,\n\n.. . ..\n\n..,\n\n. .....\n\n.,.\'\\tt .~\n\n. .-;..:.:.-~.. . ..::.\'~ . . \':.~~;\'. :..

Collections of me teo ri c du st from high altitudes provide similar information.\n\n193\n\nInterpretation of reflectance spectra (fraction of sunlight reflected as a function of wavelength) can provide\nmineralogical characterizations of the surface materials\nof objects large enough to be measured through a\nground-based telescope (refs. 10, 11). This information\nis available for several of the brighter Apollo-Amor asteroids (refs. 12-14) and indicates the distribution of\nmaterial types in the Earth-approaching population.\nSince the lifetime of an object in the near-Earth\npopulation is short (about 10 7 years), these bodies must\nbe continuously replenished from some external reservoir of material (e.g., main-belt asteroids, comets, etc.)\n(refs. 6, IS). Studies of the nature of these reservoirs and\nthe source mechanisms provide clues to the general\nnature of the material types present in the near-Earth\npopulation.\nAvailability of Raw Material\nSupplies of certain specific raw materials will be\nrequired to build or maintain an inventory for processing\npurposes. The replenishment requirements for basic raw\nmaterials consumed (e.g., incorporated in long-lived\nproducts, expended, or lost) in large quantities will\ndetermine which types of asteroidal material are most\nuseful. The minerals of major significance found in\nmeteorites (refs. 16,17) and which should be present on\nApollo asteroids include: olivine (iron-magnesium silicate), pyroxene (iron-magnesium-calcium silicate; low\nca 1ci um pyroxenes are termed "orthopyroxenes"\nbecause of their crystal structure), feldspar (calciumsodium-potassium alumino-silicate), clay minerals\n(hydrated iron-magnesium silicate), and metals (nickeliron alloys). The various meteorite types contain different abundances and compositions of these minerals in a\nrange of structural types which reflects their mode of\nformation. Four general classes of meteorites are recognized: chondrites, achondrites, stony-irons, and irons.\nChondrites were named for the presence of small\nspherical inclusions (chondrules). These meteorites contain approximately solar abundance of the nonvolatile\nelements (e.g., iron, magnesium, silicon, etc.) and apparently represent (essentially) unaltered material formed\nduring the accretion of the solar system. The ordinary\nchondrites are composed of olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar with varying amounts of NiFe metal (about\n15-19 percent H (high iron)-type; about 4-9 percent L\n(low iron)-type; about 0.3-3 percent LL (low iron, low\nmetal)-type). The carbonaceous chondrites (c. chondrites), despite their name, are not necessarily characterized by abundant carbon. Type CI-C2 (CI-CM or\n\n194\n\ntype I-II) meteorites do contain relatively abundant\ncarbon (about 1-5 percent) as graphite and tarlike\norganic compounds. The bulk of the Cl meteorites consists of a complex clay mineral assemblage and the C2\nmeteorites contain 15-70 percent olivine as inclusions\nin a clay mineral matrix. These clay minerals contain\nabout 20 percent water in their structure. Type C3\nmeteorites consist mostly of olivine and contain only\ntraces of water and carbon \xc2\xab1 percent). The C4 meteorites consist mainly of olivine and magnetite and are\nessentially devoid of either carbon or water.\nThe achondrites are silicate-rich meteorites apparently formed by igneous activity in their parent bodies.\nThese consist of various mixtures of olivine, pyroxene,\nand feldspar and include eucrites and howardites or\nbasaltic achondrites (pyroxene, feldspar) diogenites\n(pyroxene), nakhlites (olivine, calcic pyroxene), chassignites (olivine) and ureilites (olivine, carbon).\nThe stony-irons consist of mixtures of nickel-iron\nmetal (30-70 percent) with various silicates: pallasites\n(olivine), mesosiderites (pyroxene, feldspar), and several\nother mixtures.\nThe iron meteorites consist of alloys of nickel and\niron ranging from 5 percent to 50 percent nickel with an\naverage near 10 percent Ni. Cobalt (about 0.5 percent)\nand other siderophile elements (Ga, Ge, etc.) are\nenriched in many of these meteorites. The irons often\ncontain several percent silicate inclusions. Mason\n(ref. 16) provides a good introduction to the meteorites.\nWasson (ref. 17) has reviewed and summarized recent\nwork.\nTwo lines of direct evidence define the range of\nmaterials available in near-Earth space. First, the meteorites provide direct samples of such material. Wetherill\n(ref. 6) argues persuasively that most of the meteorite\nspecimens recovered at the Earth\'s surface must derive\nfrom Apollo-Amor group asteroids. Certain select mainbelt asteroids may also be supplying a component of the\nmeteorite flux (refs. 18-20). The pre-encounter orbits\nof at least three recovered meteorites (Pribram and\nLost City, refs. 21-23 and Innisfree, 1977) are consistent with the orbits of members of the Apollo population.\nA second line of direct evidence involves mineralogical characterizations of Apollo-Amor group asteroids\nfrom remotely obtained spectral evidence. Many important minerals exhibit characteristic features in their\nreflectance spectra which can be used to identify their\npresence, composition, and abundance from telescopic\nspectra (refs. 11, 14, and 24-26). Observational data of\nvarying mineralogical significance are available for\n\n12 Earth-approaching or Mars-approaching asteroids.\nThese bodies and the types of materials associated with\neach are listed in table 1. With one exception, these are\nconsistent with mafic-silicate (olivine, pyroxene) or\nmafic-silicate-metal assemblages. The available spectral\nand meteorite evidence indicates that the near-Earth\npopulation is dominated by ordinary chondri tic-type\nmaterials.\nHowever, in the observational case, one is dealing\nwith the statistics of small numbers where a selection\neffect of unknown magnitude is operating (i.e., one\ntends to preferentially discover and observe brighter\n\nobjects such as those with the highest albedo in any\ngiven size range). Anders (ref. 27) noted that it is possible to supply the ordinary chondrites from a very small\nnumber of favorably situated parent bodies. There is an\nadditional bias introduced by atmospheric entry which\noperates against weak structures, such as would be\nexpected for Cl chondrites or cometary debris (ref. 23).\nTherefore, while it is evident that ordinary chondritic\nassemblages are present in the near-Earth population,\ntheir relative abundance and the character and abundance of other types of meteoritic materials cannot be\nascertained on the basis of available data.\n\nTABLE 1.- CHARACTERIZATIONS OF APOLLO-AMOR OBJECTS\nNumber\n\nName\n\nNote a,\nAU\n\nq,a AU\n\nSurface type b\n\nAlbedo c\n\nDiameter,c\nkm\n\n0.17\n\n23\n\n433\n\nEros\n\n1.458\n\n1.13\n\nOlivine, pyroxene, metal (-H Chon)\n(ref. 13)\n\n887\n\nAlinda\n\n2.516\n\n1.15\n\nOlivine, carbon (-C3) (ref. 26)\n\n.17\n\n4\n\n1011\n\nLaodamia\n\n2.394\n\n1.56\n\n"s" -probably silicate or metal-rich\nassemblage\n\n.16\n\n7\n\n1036\n\nGanymede\n\n2.666\n\n1.22\n\n"s" -probably silicate or metal-rich\nassemblage\n\n1566\n\nIcarus\n\n1.078\n\n.19\n\nPyroxene (olivine, metal ?)(ref. 26)\n\n1580\n\nBetulia\n\n2.196\n\n1.12\n\n---\n\n(-35)\n\n.17\n\n1\n\n"c" -opaque-rich assemblage,\n\n6\n\npossibly carbonaceous\n1620\n\nGeographos\n\n1.244\n\n.83\n\n"s" -probably silicate or metal-rich\n\n3\n\n.18\n\nassemblage\n1627\n\nIvar\n\n1.864\n\n1.12\n\n"s" -probably silicate or metal-rich\n\n---\n\n(-7)\n\nassemblage\n1685\n\nToro\n\n1.368\n\n.77\n\nPyroxene, olivine (ref. 12)\n\n1864\n\nDaedalus\n\n1.461\n\n.56\n\n"O"-probably silicate or metal-rich\nassemblage\n\n2.26\n\n1.05\n\n.97\n\n.79\n\n1960 UA\n2062\n\nAten\n\n"U"\n\n?\n\n"S" -probably silicate or metal-rich\nassemblage\n\n.12\n\n3\n\n---\n\n(-2)\n\n---\n\n---\n\n.17\n\n1\n\naperihelion distance for each object.

The diameters in parentheses were derived\nassuming an average albedo for the "C-S" class of the object and should be considered as indicative only.\n\n195\n\nIt is clear, however, that the material-population pattern of the main asteroid belt is not applicable to the\nApollo population. Chapman et al. (ref. 28) evolved an\nasteroid classification scheme that utilizes observational\nproperties (UBV colors, polarization, albedo) which, in\nmodified form, has been used to define general population patterns in the asteroid belt (ref. 3). The types\ndescribed in this system (C = carbonaceous, S = silicaceous or stony-iron, M = metal-rich, etc.) should not be\ntaken as compositional descriptions. Most main-belt\nC-type asteroids turn out to be similar in spectral signature to carbonaceous type I and II meteoritic materials,\nbut a significant minority of these C-type asteroids are a\nquite different assemblage (opaque-rich mafic silicate\nassemblages) (ref. 26).\nHowever, as a classification scheme of limited compositional significance, the CoS system provides some\nimportant information concerning asteroid distributions.\nThe relative abundance of S objects increases to nearly\n50 percent at the inner edge of the belt, while the C\nobjects constitute about 76 percent of all main-belt\nasteroids (ref. 3). Of the 12 objects thus far observed\nthat either cross or approach the Earth-Mars orbits, only\none (1580 Betulia) has the low albedo and neutral colors\nof the C group. It is possible, but by no means certain,\nthat this asteroid is made up of material similar to Cl or\nC2 meteorites. Higher-resolution, broader-wavelength\nspectral data are needed before the composition of this\nobject can be established.\n\nSource Regions and Mechanisms for\nNear-Earth Asteroids\nThe two major candidates for source regions for nearEarth asteroids are the main-belt asteroids and the\ncomets. The major difficulty for an asteroidal source for\nmeteorites (and Apollo asteroids) is to modify the orbit\nfrom that of a main-belt object to an Earth-approaching\nobject in as short a time as indicated by the cosmic-ray\nexposure age of the meteorites, or at a rate sufficient to\nmaintain the Apollo population. The problem is less\nsevere for small (~l m) bodies than for larger bodies.\nCollisional injection of material from a body adjacent to\na Kirkwood Gap into the gap (ref. 19) or into a secular\nresonance with Jupiter (ref. 18) provides a way to transfer this material into Earth-crossing orbits. Momentum\ntransfer from sunlight by an absorption -reradia tion\nmechanism (Yarkovsky effect) may transfer small\nobjects (~l m) into Earth-crossing orbits in relatively\nshort time intervals (~107 yr) and might move larger\n\n196\n\nobjects into a resonance with Jupiter where relatively\nrapid orbital evolution can occur (ref. 29).\n\nAsteroids that approach the orbit of Mars can be\nsubjected to small cumulative perturbations and converted into Earth-crossing objects on a time scale of\n~lXI09 to 2XI0 9 yr (refs. 30,31). This rate is apparently too low to replenish the Apollo-Amor group from\nthe available number of Mars-approaching or Marscrossing bodies (ref. 6). Thus, while material equivalent\nto most meteorite types (except ordinary chondrites) is\npresent in the asteroid belt and mechanisms for modifying these orbits exist, questions can be raised as to the\nrelative importance of this source.\n\nThe capture of comets into the inner solar system by\nJupiter is a well-known phenomenon. Wetherill\n(ref. 6, 20) concludes that, on the basis of dynamical\nconsiderations (refs. 15,32), most (>90 percent) of the\nApollo-Amor objects are of cometary origin. In this\nmodel, to account for the type of assemblages inferred\nto be present on the Apollos, it is plausible to assume\nthat some portion of the material in cometary orbits\nrepresents the return of inner-solar-system material that\nwas expelled by Jupiter during the early postaccretionary period of the solar system. This cometary\nhypothesis is not unanimously accepted (ref. 33).\n\nIf we assume that these two hypotheses are both\ncorrect and that only the relative rates of each are in\ndoubt, then we can define a reasonable qualitative model\nof the near-Earth population. The asteroid belt should\nprovide material from objects adjacent to resonance surfaces which include achondrite, stony-iron, and\nCI-C2 and C3 type assemblages. The Mars-approaching\nasteroids may provide ordinary chondritic or stony-iron\nassemblages based on the relative increase of S-type\nobjects toward smaller semimajor axes. The cometary\nsource could provide ordinary chondritic, achondritic,\nand stony-iron materials (ejected inner-solar-system\nmaterial) and CI material (devolatilized cometary\nnuclei). A degassed cometary nucleus should retain a\nsignificant amollnt of trapped volatiles in its deep interior (water, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia ices)\n(ref. 34). The relative abundance of these types cannot\nbe established until a significant number of Apollo-Amor\nobjects have been discovered and observed with sufficient spectral resolution and wavelength coverage to\nmake mineralogical characterizations.\n\nPhysical Characteristics and Mechanical\nProperties\nThe mechanical properties of an Apollo-Amor object\nare determined by its composition and previous history.\nMost of the meteorite types exhibit a degree of coherency, that is, they tend to have reasonable physical\nstrength and are hard to crush. The irons and stony-irons\nhave the greatest strength. Ordinary chondrites tend to\nbecome stronger with increasing metamorphic grade.\nThe Cl chondrites are quite friable (weak or easily\ndisaggregated), the C2 reasonably coherent, and the C3\nreasonably hard.\nHow the characteristics of a small specimen scale up\nto an object 100 m or larger is somewhat difficult to\nevaluate. Generally, any large fragment resulting from an\nimpact event is likely to be extensively fractured and\nweak on a large scale. This is supported by meteorite fall\nevidence which indicates that most large (e.g., 2 m)\nbodies break up into many smaller ones (-20 cm) very\nsoon after initial atmospheric contact. Typically, a large\nfall will consist of hundreds of individual objects, each\nwith its own fusion crust, indicating breakup early in\nreentry. On a larger scale, doublet impact craters on\nMars and Earth are more common than impact statistics\nwould suggest, and this could be attributed to preatmospheric breakup under differential gravitational\nstress near the planet. It seems reasonable to assume that\nan object 100 m or larger will not withstand significant\ndifferential forces or high accelerations.\nDevolatilized cometary nuclei are likely to be very\nporous "fairy-castle" materials with relatively little\nphysical strength. The low density and low physical\nstrength of fireball meteors, generally associated with\nextinct comets, are evidence of these properties\n(ref. 23). While there may be relatively dense regions in\nthe interior as a result of weak compressional loading,\nthese objects can generally be considered fragile.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR GROUND-BASED TELESCOPE SEARCH FOR ASTEROIDS\nIntroduction\nStatistically, it is estimated that there are about\n1000 Earth-crossing asteroids larger than 1.0 km, many\nof which would be of interest for either missions or as\nthe sources of raw material. Yet, as of July 1977, only\n24 Apollo-type asteroids (Earth crossers) with welldefined orbits are known. Included in this small number,\n\nasteroids 1976 AA, 1976 UA, and 1977 HB are potentially attractive mission objectives. Asteroids 1976 AA\nand 1976 UA, actually the first of a new orbital class,\nwere discovered in the past year. Besides orbit and\ndelta-V considerations, the physical properties of a particular asteroid (e.g., abundance of volatiles and metals)\nwill playa role in the selection process. Therefore, we\nneed to know about the physical and chemical properties of the Apollo group.\nA planned search program, using a 46-cm (IS-in.)\nSchmidt telescope, and the subsequent increased interest\ngenerated in the astronomical community has doubled in\n4 years the number of known Apollo asteroids. It took\n40 years to discover the first 12 members. Since it has\nbeen estimated that at least 10 times as many Apollo\nasteroids should be observed to enable a judicious\nmission/resource selection, then one would estimate\nthat, at the current rate of discovery, approximately\n50 years of diligent effort would be required. This problem can be overcome by employing larger telescopes\nwith more observing time. This approach is addressed\nhere.\nA goal of an order-of-magnitude increase in known\nobjects in 5 to 10 years - a reasonable period for planning optimum use of present Space Shuttle capabilities - can be achieved by use of a 122-cm (48-in.)\nSchmidt telescope 10 days/month with appropriate support at other facilities.\n\nAsteroid Detection Probabilities\nThe probability of detecting an asteroid in a search\nprogram depends on the apparent magnitude or brightness of the object, on the limiting magnitude of the\nsearch telescope, and on the amount of time committed\nto search. Figure 3 shows the surface corresponding to\nan 18th-magnitude detection limit as a function of opposition angle and object size for two reasonable albedos\n(0.15 and 0.04) and corresponding phase functions\n(0.025 and 0.038 magnitude/deg). Figure 4 shows the\ndetection distances for a I-km object with an albedo of\n0.15 and a phase function of 0.023 magnitude/deg. The\nadvantage of searching at or near opposition is evident.\nThe disadvantage of a search at a high opposition angle\n(Sun-object-Earth angle (3) is that the volume searched\nper square degree of plate area decreases substantially\nwith increasing opposition angle. For example, at a limiting 17th magnitude for {3 = 0\xc2\xb0 - 5 .6X 10- 5 (Au 3 /deg 2 ),\n{3 = 10\xc2\xb0 - 3.8X 10- 5 , {3 = 50\xc2\xb0 - 2.1 X 10- 5 ,\n{3 = 70\xc2\xb0 - 1 .6X 10- 5 , and {3 = 90\xc2\xb0 - 1.2X 10- 5 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n197\n\nALBEDO\n\nffi\'"\n\n= 0.15\n\n7\n\n,",CO". ~ \'.m\n\nALBEDO = 0.04\nPHASE FUNCTION = 0.038 mag/deg\n1.0AU\n\n1.0 km\n\nFigure 3.- Detection distances for high- and low-albedo\nobjects as a function of object diameter and opposition\nangle (Sun-Earth-object angle). An 18th-magnitude\ndetection limit is assumed.\n\nFigure 4.- Detection distances for a high-albedo asteroid\n(0.15, 0.023 magnitude/deg), 1 km in diameter as a\nfunction ofmagnitude detection limit, m, and opposition angle.\n\n198\n\nThe probable discovery rate of Apollo asteroids as a\nfunction of telescope size and the characteristics. and\ndistribution of appropriate telescopes are given in\ntable 2. Projected discovery rates increase dramatically\nwith increasing telescope size and limiting magnitude.\nThe 46-cm (IS-in.) Palomar Schmidt is a telescope\ncurrently committed to a search for planet-crossing\nasteroids. The search program has led to the discovery\nof four Apollo asteroids over a 4-year period. Other\nApollo asteroid discoveries have been made with largeaperture Schmidt telescopes (IOO-cm (40-in.) and\nI 22-cm (4S-in.)) plates taken for other purposes. Observations with the IOO-cm (40-in.) ESO Schmidt have\nconcentrated on the Fast-Blue Survey (FBS) of southern\nskies, extending the Palomar National Geographic Sky\nSurvey to declinations below _23\xc2\xb0. The I 22-cm (4S-in.)\nPalomar Schmidt is used for many purposes, but the\nongoing monthly program plates that have recorded the\nApollo asteroids are the Supernovae Program and the\nSolar-System Search. Four Apollo asteroids have been\nincidentally discovered on 122-cm (4S-in.) Palomar\nSchmidt plates. The ESO Schmidt (operated by R. M.\nWest and H. E. Schuster on the FBS) has found one\nApollo, but only after several had been lost because the\nplates were not examined soon enough for followup\nobservations. Too much time had elapsed since the\nplates were taken, and the fleet object was lost.\nIf one or two moderate-sized Schmidts (apertures 24,\n32, and 36 in.) were dedicated to search systematically\nduring a 7-1 O-day period each dark of the Moon or if\nsufficient time were allocated on existing Schmidt telescopes (24- to 4S-in. aperture), the current yearly discovery rate could be increased 5 to 10 times (in the last\n2 years, three or four Apollo asteroids have been discovered each year). Only four of these asteroids were discovered in a search program designed specifically for\ntheir detection. The other discoveries were made on\nplates taken for other purposes. Hence, if one or two\ntelescopes devoted to serious search were available, one\nco u 1d ve ry conservatively estimate an order-ofmagnitude increase in discovered objects. If one uses the\npresent known number of Apollo asteroids (24), it is\nreasonable to estimate that the number could be\ndoubled in a year of concentrated effort. B. G. Marsden\n(Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Harvard University, personal communication, 1975) pointed out that\nthere should be two Apollo asteroids discovered each\nmonth with the I 22-cm (4S-in.) Palomar Schmidt telescope during dark runs. With this increase in known\nobjects, it is reasonable (based on the discovery of\n(I 943), 1976 AA, 1976 UA, 1977 HB, and somewhat\n\nless suitable, 1975 YA) that 5 to 10 percen t of the new\ndiscoveries would prove to have orbital characteristics\nthat would qualify them as favorable mission candidates\n(ref. 35).\n\nAsteroid Search Recommendations Observation\nThe search efforts must be accelerated to ensure a\ndramatic increase in the discovery rate of planet-crossing\nasteroids. The commitment of any instrument for a\ndedicated asteroid search should include the detection of\nall classes of asteroids up to the magnitude limit of the\nsearch instrument. To optimize such a search, a strong\nrecommendation would be to secure the use of or financial support for the construction of a large Schmidt\ntelescope (I 22-cm (4S-in.)). The objective of this search,\nhowever, would be to detect objects of moderate to fast\nmotion (l/3\xc2\xb0 per day, upward) and therefore generally\nclose to the Earth. Using the 46-cm (lS-in.) Schmidt\ntelescope, in which 1/3\xc2\xb0 per day motion was used as a\nlower limit of motion for followup work, has produced\n20 discoveries: 4 Apollos, 5 Mars crossers, 3 asteroids in\nthe Phocaea regions, 2 asteroids in the Hungaria region,\nand 7 others from the edge of the main-belt region. The\n\nlimiting factor for increasing the discovery numbers is\nthe detection limit of a given telescope. The limiting\nmagnitude of the IS-in. Schmidt is about magnitude 15\nfor a moving object.\nBased on current numbers, one might expect that\nabout 5 to 10 percent of the new objects would be of\ninterest for rendezvous or sample return missions. This is\na conservative estimate, based on only the 24 known\nApollos. By committing a large-aperture Schmidt for a\nlO-day /month search, one could optimally expect to\ndiscover about 250 Earth crossers in 10 years or about\n500 Earth crossers in 20 years.\nProposed System of Search\nA search plan should consist of photographing a series\nof standard fields distributed along the ecliptic and\nextending to moderate latitudes north of the ecliptic. A\n122-cm (4S-in.) Schmidt camera plate is 35.5 X 35.5 cm\n(14 X 14 in.) and is 6.6 degrees in effective diameter.\nMonthly (each dark run), a series of fields should be\nphotographed clustered around opposition. Two exposures should be made of each standard field, one of\n12-min duration and one of 6 min. Typical planetcrossing objects can be recognized on the 12-min exposures by the amount of elongation or trailing of their\n\nTABLE 2.- DISCOVERY RATE OF APOLLO ASTEROIDS VERSUS TELESCOPE\n\nTelescope\naperture\nsize,\ncm (in.)\n\nDiscovery\nrate\n(current)\n\nPotential\ndiscovery\nrate by\nincreasing to\n10 nights/\ndark run\n\nThreshold\nmagnitude/size\nfor moving\nobjects\n\nTelescopes\nin\nU.S.\n\nTelescopes\noutside\n\nAvailability\nof equipment,\nnights/yr\n\nCost of\nnew instruments,\n$ millions\n\n>2\n\n15 m = 0.5 kmQ\n\n50 (20)\n\n>2\n\n15~5\n\n1\n\n61 (24)\n\n2-3\n\n15~5\n\n2\n\nSI (32)\n\n3-4\n\n16~5\n\nI\n\n10-15 nights/year\nbut not now in\noperation\n\n>4\n\n16-17m;;;. 0.3 km\n\n1\n\nESO Southern Sky\nSurvey - by-product\n\n2.25\n\n1\n\n---\n\n2.75\n\n2\n\nStandard program\nby-product\n\n3\n\n46 (I S)\n\n100 (40)\n\nI per year;\n4S nights/year\n\n1-2 per year\n(incidental)\n\n105 (42)\n122 (4S)\n\n5-6\nI per year\n(incidental)\n\n>S\n\n17-17~5;;;\' 0.2 km\n\n50-60\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0.25\n\n-----\n\n.3\n.4\n\n.9\n\nQSize estimate corresponds to detection limit of discovery telescope.\n\n199\n\nimages. The 6-min exposures would be used to confirm\nthe detected objects and to determine their direction of\nmotion. Under good seeing conditions, stars to 21 mare\nrecorded in 6-7 min exposures with a variety of plate\nemulsions (e.g., 103 a-o, a-e). The magnitude limit for\ndetecting moving objects is lower; however, fast-moving\nplanet-crossing asteroids fainter than apparent magnitude 17 to 17.5 would only be marginally discernible.\nExposed plates should be developed immediately and\nscanned within 24 hr by microscopic examination. Generally, three observer teams would work shifts\nthrough an observing run; this intensive effort requires\nparticipation by several persons and, if continued\nthrough a lO-l4-day dark run, would require two or\nthree team shift rotations. Fast-moving objects must be\ndetected promptly and followed for several days or they\nwill be lost. Followup observations should also be\nobtained at least through the following lunation, if possible, so that the orbi ts can be computed with sufficient\naccuracy to recover these objects on their second\napparition.\nWith the immediate goal of an expanded search program to accumulate sufficient observations to derive\nreliable orbits, the discovery telescope must continue to\nfollow the new discovery. But it is critical that\nother observatories better located for followup observation be willing to collaborate on securing needed\nobservations.\nAsteroid Search Recommendations - Telescopic\nand Manpower Support\nWith a large Schmidt telescope and with adequate\nsupport, data necessary for the mission/natural resource\nprogram can be obtained within an acceptable time.\nTable 2 shows the presently available telescopes and\nprojected rate of discovery when applied lO nights/\nmonth to this program. To produce the data within a\nfeasible period of time (5 to 10 years), time on a l22-cm\nSchmidt telescope is required. Table 3 shows a cost\nbreakdown for constructing and supporting such a\nfacility.\nOnce a principal telescope is available, there is a\nrelated significant problem, that is, backup and followup\nby other astronomical facilities. This support is necessary to secure orbits, particularly when weather or other\ndifficulties render the discovery telescope inoperable on\nsubsequent nights or when the motion of the object\ncarries it beyond the observational range of the discovery instrument (e.g., to high negative declinations). With\nthe discovery of relatively large numbers of objects, this\n\n200\n\ncould require a significant effort rather than the present\nsomewhat informal effort, often the result of personal\ncontact.\nAn observational clearinghouse should be established\nto collect monthly telescope logs from observatories\nwith suitable telescopes. This could be handled simply the monthly plates of each telescope could be reproduced, punched on cards, and collated on printouts and\ndistributed to interested observers. From this information on known existing plates and their positions, it is\npossible to check for additional observations of a new\ndiscovery either before or after discovery. Locating\nplates that contain needed positions from a review of\nPalomar logbooks has revealed additional positions of\nnew objects, extending the arc from a few days to a few\nmonths. A substantial increase in secure orbits could be\nobtained at relatively low cost by the coordinated use of\nsuch a clearinghouse for long-exposure, wide-angle\nplates.\nTo determine surface compositions, it would be most\ndesirable to discover these bodies before opposition and,\nideally, with several weeks or mon ths of lead time so\nthat observation time could be requested on large telescopes. To do this, it would be necessary to search a\n0\nregion near the ecliptic about 90 from the opposition\npoint (forward for objects beyond 1 AU, backward from\nobjects inside 1 AU). This requirement would decrease\nsomewhat the efficiency of a search program. From the\npoint of view of obtaining compositional characterizations of these objects (spectrophotometric or radiometric observations), it would seem worthwhile to partition a portion of any general search effort into a survey\nof the {3 = 0 to {3 = \xc2\xb190\xc2\xb0 directions. The value of early\ndetection and discovery-opposition spectral work is high\nfor interesting objects whose synodic periods are long\n(>5 years). Failure to achieve a compositional characterization during the discovery opposition means a wait\nequal to the synodic period before such a study can be\nmade.\n\nASTEROID MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATIONSRECOMMENDATIONS\nAny reasonable scenario for asteroidal resource utilization will require a spacecraft survey mission to a likely\ncandidate body selected on the basis of a preliminary\nmaterial characterization from Earth-based studies, Even\nif nonspecific mass is desired, a characterization will be\nnecessary to define the most appropriate recovery program (e.g., type of processing and mining equipment,\n\nTABLE 3.- COST ESTIMATES FOR DEDICATION OF A l22-cm (48-in.)

The available techniques for studying these objects\ncan be divided into ground-based (or near-Earth) and\nspacecraft.\nEarth-based characterizations must depend on information contained in reflected sunlight (reflectance spectroscopy) or reflected man-made radiation (radar) or in\nemitted thermal radiation (thermal infrared, thermal\nmicrowaves). Reflectance spectroscopy is most sensitive\nto surface mineralogy, but a certain minimum spectral\nresolution and wavelength coverage is necessary to\nobtain such characterizations. A spectrum with\nI-percent resolution over the interval 0.3-5 pm could\nprovide detailed information (mineral chemistry, abundance, and distribution) on surface materials. In practice, one almost certainly would not be able to obtain\n\n0.175\n4.035\n\nsuch spectral data for the asteroids in near-Earth space.\nThe photon flux from the observed object (magnitude,\ntelescope size, detector sensitivity, the flux onto\ndetector and atmospheric transmission) are the main\nfactors that control the resolution and coverage of spectral data. Low-resolution data (e.g., broad bandpass UBV\nfilters) can be obtained for very faint objects (i.e.,\n18 magnitude), but are not particularly sensitive to surface composition. High-resolution spectra cannot be\nmade for very faint objects unless longer integration\ntimes or lower spectral precision is accepted. Simultaneous detection over a broad spectral region (e.g.,\ndispersion of the spectrum across an array of detector\nelements - vidicon or CCD spectrometer or interferometer) can alleviate this discrepancy somewhat. Wavelength coverage depends on the additional factors of\n\n201\n\nspectral flux and atmospheric transmission. The spectral\nflux of almost any object reflecting sunlight peaks in the\nmid-visible and decreases rapidly toward the UV and IR\n(e.g., at 1.0-Jim flux, it is down to a third of the peak\nflux and at 2.0 pm, down to 5 percent) following a\nblackbody curve for ~6000 K object (Sun). This flux\nloss must be compensated for by increasing integration\ntimes or decreasing resolution. Atmospheric absorptions\nin the near IR (e.g., H2 0 vapor at 1.4 and 1.9 pm)\neffectively block these spectral regions for faint objects.\nWe recommend a multiple approach to ground-based\nstudies of the near-Earth population of asteroids:\n\n1. A low-resolution, wide-coverage spectral program\n(UBVRUHK). These data can provide some indicative\nco mpositional information on very faint objects\n(~17-19magnitude on large (~lOO-in. or 2.5m) telescopes) in an observing period of several days. The IR\nfilters (RUHK) are essential since they can provide criteria for discriminating metal-rich assemblages from\nsilicate-rich assemblages and may provide a preliminary\nsubdivision of the opaque-rich assemblages.\n2. A moderately high-resolution (~3 percent), widecoverage (0.3-2.0 Jim) spectral program. This program\ncan provide detailed mineralogical characterizations for\nreasonably faint asteroids ( ~l5-16 magnitude) observed\nwith a large telescope (~100 in. or 2.5 m). The instrumentation to make these measurements (vidicon or CCD\narrays) are being developed as astronomical instruments.\n3. Measurements of the thermal IR can be used to\ndetermine the diameter and albedo of faint asteroids\n(~16-17 magnitude) on the large telescopes. The albedo\nprovides an additional compositional discriminant.\n4. Radar reflectances of these asteroids can be\nobtained only when the object is near Earth and\nwhen it is in a portion of the sky accessible to the large\nradio telescopes, such as Arecibo.\n5. Photopolarimetry measurements can be made of\nreasonably bright objects (~14 magnitude). Measurements near opposition which can determine the shape\nand depth of the negative branch of the phasepolarization curve can provide clues on the structure and\noptical density of the surface material.\n6. High-resolution spectroscopy (~3 percent) of the\nthermal infrared should provide indications of silicate\nchemistry, but previous attempts to apply this to telescopically observed objects have not been successful.\nlimiting magnitude (~12 magnitude) is probably not\nfaint enough to be of general interest to this program.\n7. The compositional significance of thermal microwaves and the limiting magnitude is unclear.\n\n202\n\nA program of low- and high-resolution, wide-coverage\nreflectance spectroscopy coupled with broadband thermal IR radiometry should provide a basis for a reasonably precise characterization of asteroid materials. The\nhigh-resolution, wide-coverage reflectance spectroscopy\nis the essential component of such a characterization.\nThe design of a spacecraft system to characterize an\nasteroid or several asteroids depends rather critically on\nthe mission profile. Mission options include single- or\nmultiple-asteroid flybys or rendezvous with either ballistic or low-thrust spacecraft. The asteroid studies that can\nbe done with available spacecraft instrumentation and\ngeneral mission profiles are discussed separately. Experience derived from the design of a state-of-the-art mission for studying the Moon (LPO) is helpful in a discussion of possible asteroid missions.\nExperiments that characterize the "chemical" properties of a planetary surface remotely include reflectance,\nx-ray, gamma-ray, and alpha-particle spectrometers. A\nspacecraft reflectance spectrometer can provide detailed\nmineralogical characterizations of each spatial resolution\nelement on the surface of the asteroid. An x-ray spectrometer detects the x-ray emission lines of lighter elements (Z < 16 and, under favorable conditions, Z :S 30)\nthat have been excited by solar x-rays to obtain elemental ratios such as Mg/Si. A gamma-ray spectrometer\ndetects gamma-ray emission from (1) the decay of\nnatural radioactive elements, (2) the decay of radioisotopes induced by galactic cosmic-ray bombardment, and\n(3) decay of excited nuclei in atoms subjected to galactic\ncosmic-ray bombardment. A gamma-ray instrument will\nobtain elemental ratios for the naturally occurring radioisotopes (U, Th, K40) and the abundant elements (e.g.,\nFe, Mg, Si, 0, etc.) in the surface material. A gamma-ray\nspectrometer can also measure the content of water (H)\nin the surface material of an asteroid. An alpha-particle\nspectrometer measures the energy of alpha particles\nemitted by the decay of daughter products of the U-Th\nseries.\nOther experiments that remotely characterize surface\nproperties include thermal infrared and microwave\nradiometers and radar sounders and altimeters. An infrared radiometer measures the temperature distribution\nacross the asteroid surface, which provides an indication\nof surface (~1-1 0 cm) conductivity (thermal inertia,\ntexture), while a microwave radiometer can characterize\nthe temperature distribution with depth for the top\nmeter or so of the surface material. A radar sounder/\naltimeter can measure the texture (particle size) and\n\nconductivity of the top meter or several meters (depending on wavelength) of the surface material and can\nmeasure the shape of the asteroid with precision.\nAn imaging system is essential both for terminal guidance during approach to the asteroid and in obtaining\nhigh-resolution (~I-1O m) photographs of the body.\nPhotographs are important for locating the ground\ntracks of high-resolution instruments (e.g., reflectance\nspectrometer, thermal infrared, and radar) to relate their\nresults to surface features. Photographs also provide size\nand shape information which can be combined with\nmass determination to obtain bulk density.\n\nSpacecraft tracking during a flyby can provide a mass\ndetermination and, during the orbit about an asteroid,\ncan provide a very precise mass determination, moment\nof inertia, and density distribution measurements that\nprovide information on the internal structure of the\nasteroid.\n\nIn situ measurements can be made by experiments\ndelivered to the surface either by a soft lander or a\npenetrator. Chemical (alpha-particle backscattering, neutron activation analysis, x-ray fluorescence) and mineralogical analysis (reflectance spectrometer, x-ray diffraction) can be carried out on the surface. Monitoring the\ndeceleration of the penetrator on impact provides a\nmeasure of physical strength of materials. A soft lander\nwould be needed to acquire a sample for any sample\nreturn mission.\nThe scientific payload on any asteroid mission will\ndepend on the propulsion systems available and the\nsurvey goals. For a ballistic trajectory and given propulsion system (e.g., Shuttle plus interim upper stage\n(IUS)), the total spacecraft mass launched to an asteroid\n(spacecraft bus, additional propulsion requirements,\nscientific payload) will depend on the orbit of the target\nasteroid. A low-thrust propulsion system (after trajectory insertion) can increase payload capacity or enable\nmultiple asteroid rendezvous mission~. An ideal mission\n(neglecting sample return) would probably involve insertion of the spacecraft into an orbit (or station-keeping\nlocation) near the asteroid for an extended survey mission (months). With a low-thrust propulsion system, the\nspacecraft can be inserted into a new trajectory to a\nsecond or third asteroid.\nWe recommend planning studies to optimize a series\nof spacecraft missi\'Jns based on the propulsion systems\navailable in the near term (1978-1985) and far term\n(post-1985) for various asteroid targets.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

CRISWELL\n\nThe initial lunar supply base should have a mass less than 1000 tons, be deployed by 25 persons in 4 months, and be\nmaintained by 10 persons. Output could be expanded 20 times in 5 years to 600,000 tons/yr by a factor of 10 expansion of the area of the solar array on the lunar surface, using low power soil beneficiation, increasing the fleet of mining\nvehicles, and illuminating the base continuously at night with lunar orbiting mirrors. The space manufacturing facility\n(SMF) will supply most of the mass (solar cells and orbiting mirrors) necessary for expansion. Several devices and procedures are suggested for development which could further reduce the total mass necessary to transport to the Moon to\nestablish the initial lunar supply base.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe ultimate objective of space industrialization is to\ncreate a growing economy in space which can eventually\nbecome self-sufficient. Space industry is presently supported by sales of goods with extremely high intrinsic\nvalues, such as satellites for communications, research,\nnavigation and reconnaissance. Low-volume production\nof exotic goods in the zero-gravity and weightless conditions afforded in near-Earth space may broaden the\nmarket for space produced goods. However, in all these\ncases the cost of transporting the goods or raw materials\ninto low-Earth orbit will add $200-$700/kg to the\nproduct price for a period of 15 years and thus place a\nsharp limit on the ultimate terrestrial market (ref. 1).\nThere appears to be a way of circumventing the present\nhigh cost of launching materials from the Earth into\nspace. This can be done by acquiring bulk raw materials\nfrom the Moon or asteroids and processing them in space\ninto economically valuable products. Initial bulk material costs could be of the order of $25/kg in high-Earth\norbit (Salkeld, p. 187) and the cost would drop with\nexperience. There would be two effects of lower material costs. First, the space economy could begin\napproaching the richness and cost structures of our present terrestrial economy. Secondly, the range of space\nproducts that could be sold for terrestrially-related use\neither in space or on Earth would be greatly expanded.\n\nThe Moon can supply most of the mass needed for\nlarge-scale industry in space. There are two ways to\napproach the proof of this statement. The first is to look\nin detail at the materials needed to construct specific\nproducts in space. At this point in time the production\nof space solar power stations is an attractive candidate\nbecause of the high value per unit mass of such objects\nand because of the large number of stations which could\nbe required (>200 in next 30 years). Analyses even of\ndesigns not optimized for lunar elements reveal that at\nleast 60 percent of the required silicon, aluminum and\noxygen could be obtained from the Moon and the total\nmass lifted from Earth could be reduced about 80 percent by utilizing lunar materials (refs. 2, 3).\nAlternatively, one can compare the nonfuel distribution of nonrecoverable elements (weight fraction) utilized in the industrial economy of the United States with\nelements present in the lunar soil as is shown in table 1\n(ref. 4). The fraction of these elements which can be\nextracted with reasonable and presently available chemical processing techniques from beneficiated lunar ores is\nthe subject of two companion papers by Williams et al.\nand Rao et al. (p. 275 and p. 257, respectively)\ndiscuss extraction of Si, 0, Fe, AI, Ti, and H2 O. Using\nthese and other proposed extraction procedures most of\nthe components of the synthetic molecule of "Demandite" (defined in table 1), which constitute most of the\nnon fuel material inputs to American industry, could be\n\n207\n\nTABLE 1.- NONFUEL DEMANDITE (U.S., 1958) COMPARED TO ELEMENTARY DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOIL AT THE APOLLO-IS LANDING SITE (WEIGHT FRACTIONS)\nNonfuel\ndemanditea\n\nApollo 15\nmare-low Ti\n\nBulk soil (1 unit)b\n\nEnhancement\nrequired\n\nExcess\n\nDeficiency\n-\n\nSi\n0\n\n0.2444\n.4547\n\nFe\nMg\n(Cu,Zn,Pb)\n\n.0479\n.0023\n.0017\n.0020\n\nxd\n\n.0030 L -.0569 0.0189 L -.2951\n\nCae\n\n.1417\n.0095\n.0058\n.0021\n.0019\n\n.0696\n.0023\n.0006\n.0008\n.0005\n\n.0147\n.0083\n.0574\n.0025\n.0001\n\n7.6 (-6)\n8 (-5)\n9.5 (-5)\n6.4(-5)\n.0023\n\n1.0000\n\n1.0000\n\nAI\n\nNa\nS\n\nKe\n\npe\nCl\n\nNe\nCe .!\n\nHI\n\nOther g\n\n0.2158\n.4130\n.1535\n.0546\n.0681\n2.2(-5f\n\n-----\n\n.31\n.04\n.025\n\n0.0286\n.0417\n\n0.1056\n.0523\n.0664\n\n1.13\n1.10\n\n-------\n\n---\n\n90\n.15\n\n.0020\n\n---\n\n.0159\n\n-----\n\n2.0\n4.1\n9.7\n2.6\n3.8\n\n.0721\n.0072\n.0052\n.0013\n.0014\n\n---\n\n-------\n\n1934\n103\n604\n350\n\n.0147\n.0083\n.0573\n.0025\n---\n\n-----\n\n--.03\n\n.0022\n\n(+) 0.2424\n\n(-) 0.2423\n---\n\n----\n\naDemandite data supplied in reference 4.\nbFormula = (Wt. fraction lunar element) - (Wt. fraction demandite).\n\nc(N) == ION.\nd x ~ Mn, Ti, Cr, Ba, F, Ni, Ar, Sn, Br, Zr.\neImportant agriculturally.\nthe smaller grains \xc2\xab50,11).\ngYirtually the complete suite of elements is present in these areas, but their\ncontribu tions (on the ppm and ppb levels) are lost in the errors of the sum over\nthe listed elements.

Beneficiation of soil components to enhance\nand possibly simplify known chemical extraction processes should be achievable using electrostatic, magnetic,\ndielectric and mechanical techniques and careful site\n\n208\n\nselection. Elements such as Cu, Zn, Pb, H, CI, N, C, and\nother trace elements comprise 8.4 percent of the demandite molecule. These elements would be shipped from\nEarth, eventually located from other sources, such as\nnon-Apollo sites, or other materials substituted for\nthem. In any event, it is clear that of order of90 percent\nof the present day inventory of industrial elements can\nbe provided from known lunar soils. Lunar soil processed to provide 90 percent of the demandite complement at $20jkg (i.e., Si, AI, Fe, Mg, Ca, and 0) and the\nremainder supplied from Earth at $300jkg would provide the in-space demandi te molecule at a cost of about\n$50/kg or 17 percent of the direct supply cost (ref. 4).\n\nIt is very clear, however, that substitution of materials, which is being required in the terrestrial economy\neven now, will permit much greater use of lunar materials both in general and for specific products (ref. 5).\nThus, the cost of space "demandite" should approach\nthe cost of the lunar processed materials.\n\nThe economic value to Earth of the Moon or the\nasteroids as a source of raw materials is strongly dependent on the total retrieval and elemental separation costs\nof the raw materials. Figure 1 is a qualitative description\nof the costs of goods or end-use-material on a dollar per\nkilogram basis (horizontal axis) versus the differential\noutput of the total value of goods in the U.S. economy\nin billions of dollars per dollar per kilogram or\n12\n(~109 $/($/kg)) for a total GNP of $10\n(ref. 1).\nMost goods now sell for less than $l0/kg with most\nbetween $0.1 /kg and $2/kg. Transport into low-Earth\norbit (LEO) from the Earth presently adds more than\n$500/kg and thus confines goods produced in space to a\ntiny fraction of the potential terrestrial market (right of\narrow 1 in fig. 1). Solar power stations are estimated to\nbe economically feasible at $140/kg (refs. 3,6). Supplying the bulk of the required construction material from\nthe Moon at $20/kg (arrow 2) would clearly improve the\neconomics and decrease the cost of the power supplied\nto Earth. If sources of industrial feedstock can be developed in deep space with costs of less than $O.5/kg\n(arrow 3) then many of the Earth-produced goods can\n\nY, x\n\nt\n\n(~ \xe2\x80\xa2 10 9 +/kg)\n\nX, S/kg\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n.01\n\n.1\n\n10\nX, S/kg\n\n100\n\nbe considered for potential space manufacture (ref. 1). It\nis conceivable that industrial material can be supplied at\nsuch low costs from the Moon or asteroids assuming\nnormal industrial "learning curve" experience occurs.\nPrevious scientific exploration of the Moon and the\nvigorous ongoing program of lunar sample research and\ntheoretical analyses allows us to study and plan in detail\nfor obtaining lunar materials and chemically processing\nthem. However, additional research is necessary and\nshould be an ongoing component of the lunar base siting\nand operation. A general survey of the Moon is necessary - including the polar regions. There should be a\nclose tie-in of the lunar sample and planetary sciences\ncommunities, with the engineering communities responsible for research and development of lunar bases and\nrefining schemes. Above all, design of the lunar supply\nbase should be approached so as to minimize total cost\nand maximize output to provide useful components of\nthe lunar soil at points in deep space at the lowest\npossible cost per unit mass.\nThe following sections describe one approach toward\na lunar base of minimal size which could be expanded in\nlaunch capacity from 30,000 tons/yr (bulk soil) to\n600,000 tons/yr (beneficiated soil components) over a\n5-year period making maximum use of lunar materials to\nminimize shipping from the Earth.\n\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the support supplied\nby the NASA-Ames Research Center in organizing the\nlogistics and operation of this summer study.

Upon\nco mpletion of the ba se, the three adjustable mirrors\nimmediately to the east , west , and no rth , dominate the\n\nsce ne. Figure 3 is a sca led schemati c of the base which\nwill assist in loca ting the components de scribed in the\nfollowing tour. The solar array (item 6 in fig . 3) is about\n180 m on a side (10 percent efficient cells) with a mass\nof 108 tons . Each of the three side mirrors (1 80 m wide,\n260 m high) is individually adjustable to focus the maximum amount of sunlight onto the so lar array and cat ch\nthe last glimpses of the Sun after local sun set. Most\nimportan tly, it focuses the ren ected sunlight from two\nto four solettas (large mirrors o rbitin g the Moo n) which\nprovide t he equatorial ba se at night with one-ninth the\nfull so lar illumination adequate initially to maintain continuous operation of the mining, maintenan ce , and life\nsyste ms, but no t mass driver o peration.

The reflective area is increased thereafter\nusing aluminum and fiberglass produced at the space\nmanufacturing facility (SMF).\nThis soletta approach seems awkward on first consideration. However, the orbiting mirrors can be constructed in low Earth orbit and solar-sailed to lunar orbit\nwithout using propellant. They may also be capable of\ntransferring significant cargo on a one-time basis. Such\ncapability is not examined in this paper. Of immediate\ninterest is the fact that use of solettas allows one to\neliminate the need for about 400 tons of power storage\nequipment (example - flywheels) for nighttime operation of the base and also the 280 tons of propellant\nnecessary to land the power storage units. Thus, the\nmass one transports to low lunar orbit could be\ndecreased from 2600 tons (table 2 of Vajk et aI., p. 65)\nto 1920 tons. It is conceivable that one can reduce the\nnumber of MDRE trips to deploy the base from LEO to\nLLO to two or even less by use of the solettas for\nillumination and possibly transport.\nRestricting early mass driver operation to the lunar\nday, deploying a directable solar array and utilizing the\nsolettas, enables continuous operations in construction\nand running of the base, minimizes the need for power\nstorage and support machinery (the latter by a factor\nof 2) and greatly ~oderates the thermal day (night\nextremes at the lunar site.\n\nLunar base is on the Earth side of the Moon near a\njuncture region between Mare Tranquillitatis and the\neastward highlands. At night, a pinpoint of light 8.7 km\nacross is centered on the base and is visible from Earth as\na variable star in the dark disk of the Moon. Four large,\nmultifaceted mirrors, each 8.7 km in diameter and\n240 metric tons in mass and in lunar orbits that are\ncontinuously sunlit, can illuminate the base with\nreflected sunlight. These orbiting mirrors are named\nsolettas (refs. 8, 9). Continuous tracking of each mirror\nallows each to be sailed in its orbit about the Moon using\nthe pressure of sunlight, so as to maintain the apolune of\neach soletta directly above the lunar base during the\nnight. As seen from the lunar surface, the mini-suns\nsequentially rise in the west, cross the vertical meridian\njust higher than 30\xc2\xb0 above the horizon, and set in the\neast just after the following soletta rises in the west.\nThus, there is a continuous input of solar energy for\npower, locally warming the extreme cold of lunar night\nand providing illumination for mining. The initial solettas were assembled in low Earth orbit from terrestrial\n\nAlso visible from landing altitude is the 2-km-long,\n5-m-wide mound of excavated lunar soil which covers\nthe top of the tunnel containing the mass driver (item 1,\nfig. 3). A very slight dogleg is visible 200 m from the far\nend where the 3.8 kg slugs of packaged lunar soil are\nejected from the deaccelerating buckets (item Ie, fig. 3).\nThree kilometers beyond is the first "Drift and Stabilization Section" (item If, fig. 3). At the end of the dogleg\nis a 1OO-m-diameter loop wherein the buckets are turned\naround and returned on a passive guideway toward the\nmain tunnel and the loading facility. Almost all other\nfeatures of the base, including the initial strip mine\n(item 5, fig. 3) are difficult to discern because of their\nsmall size, the blending covers of lunar soil, and the\nvisual confusion of permanent disturbance patterns in\nthe lunar soil resulting from the emplacement of the\nbase and ongoing vehicular operations.\nTechnical details of the mass driver are given in a\ncompanion paper. Here the concentration is on layout\nrelated to installation, volume, and mass. The major\nmass driver acceleration sections are assembled from\n23 connected subsections.

All components of the\nmass driver system must be shielded from the extremely\nfine lunar dust. Thermal fluctuations must also be minimized to simplify design of the electronic and mechanical elements, maintain stable operating conditions, and\nprolong component lifetime. Radiation protection\nshould also be provided for maintenance personnel. The\nMD system is laid out in a leveled trench 5 m wide,\nwhich is encased by heavy fiber reinforced Kevlar sheets\nlaid directly on the lunar soil in the trench and supported on the side walls and ceiling by graphite epoxy\nstays (20 m formed hoops of I cm 2 cross section) every\nmeter down the tube. Small openings are provided for\nejection of the slugs and escape of gas from space suit\nand repair operations. The stays and Kevlar mass is less\nthan 20 metric tons. Lunar soil is heaped over the sides\n2\nand top of the trench to a thickness of 4 m (300 g/cm\ncolumn density) thus providing an extremely stable thermal environment of ~ \xc2\xb1I K (ref. 10) and complete radiation protection for repair and maintenance workers.\nPortable pressure chambers are provided which can be\nset up wherever in the tunnel detailed repair or maintenance is required. Accelerator sections can also be\nunplugged and rolled down the tunnel to the maintenance section.\nBags of lunar soil (""3.8 kg) are ejected by the mass\ndriver from the Moon. Downrange adjustment of the\nejection velocity (i.e., velocity trimming) is accomplished by means of two trim stations. Each bag is\nelectrostatically charged as it enters the trim station. In\nthe station, electric fields parallel and perpendicular to\nthe bag\'s velocity vector adjust the bag\'s trajectory and\nvelocity to great precision. The two trim stations are\nlocated 3 and ISO km downrange. It is highly desirable\nto complete most final velocity trim (AV) of the payloads close to the main base (ref. 11). This is\nbecause the trim energy is proportional to 1/2 mvAv\nand will be of the order of 10 kW (m = 26.6 kg/sec,\n80 percent duty cycle; v = 2.4 km/sec, Av = 0.1 m/sec).\nThis power is easy to obtain near the main solar array\nand no storage would be required. By trimming the\ndispersion velocity of the slugs to less than 0.1 em/sec,\nthe radius of the downrange guidance unit could be\nreduced and less energy storage and total station mass\nand complexity would be required at the downrange\nstation than assumed by Vajk et al. (p. 61). Note that\nthe solettas will not provide continuous sunlight at the\ndownrange station.\nTable 2 lists the systems features of the mass driver\ndiagrammed in figure 3.

The mass driver was\nfully tested in vacuum on Earth for 1 year prior to\nshipment. It was constructed in major 20-m sections\nspecifically designed for "plug together" assembly with\nan absolute minimum of detailed work and extensively\nwired for remote (terrestrial or lunar base) monitoring of\nstatus, performance, and adjustments. Major components on each section (e.g., magnets, guide rails, radiators, monitors) were designed for quick plug-in and,\nwhere necessary, mechanical attachment without intricate assembly. Subassembly maintenance was designed\nto be done by removing accelerator units to the pressurized maintenance shop or utilizing portable pressure\n\nchambers. Foundation points for the mass driver are\nprovided by mixing a binding agent 10 percent by\nvolume (imported from Earth) with lunar soil and casting the foundation blocks in situ in lightweight plastic\nforms with the attachment points fitted in the mold.\nLH2 tanks of the space shuttles (8 m diameter, 24 m\nclear length) provide pressure vessels for the four major\nbase units: (1) habitat; (2) loading facility; (3) packaging\nunit; and (4) maintenance shop. Units 2,3, and 4 were\ndesigned as emergency habitats and to accommodate the\nextra workers during the initial emplacement period. All\nthese units are connected by continuously pressurized\ntunnels with airlocks at each end. The loading facility\nand packaging units were sized initially for the full\nproduction capability of the base (l.6X 10 8 slugs/year at\n3.8 kg/slug). In the automatic loading facility slugs are\naccepted from the stockpile bin, weighed, center of mass\n\n213\n\ndetermined, the aluminum charging and tracking pattern\nsprayed on, correctly positioned, a last integrity check\nof the packaging performed and the slug placed in the\nbucket of the mass driver. The loading facility accepts\nbuckets from the return tracks of the mass driver, offloads the buckets, checks each bucket (containment and\nrelease mechanism, superconductor temperature and\nfield, NDT structure check, scan of sleeve in container\nsection, adjust sleeve for payloads of different density\n2-6 g/cm 3 ) and then transfers the bucket to the loading\ncarousels. Subsequently, the bucket and payload are\nrechecked for total mass and center of mass and then\ntransferred to the access section, equipped with a short\nsection of supercon ducting guideway and accelerated\ninto the main portion of the track at a very precise\nacceleration. Velocity is checked just prior to entry onto\nthe main track and, if necessary, buckets not accelerated\nto the preducted velocity are shunted immediately to\nthe return track. As needed, the passive cooling system\nof each bucket is refrigerated to insure the continued\nsuperconducting status of the bucket coils. Initially, the\nloading facility operates for 80 percent of the daytime\nduty cycle. It is expected that tilis will approach 90 percent of the full lunar month after 3 years of operation.\nThe mass of the loading units is 40 tons and they consume 100 kW during initial daytime operations and\n30 kW at standby.\nBetween the loading facility (item 2) and the packaging unit (item 4) is a stockpile (item 3) capable of holding a 10-day reserve of slugs (30,000 ton/yr launch rate).\nThe bins are top-loaded and bottom-emptied by conveyor units that can sort slugs by length corresponding\nto different densities (2-6 g/cm 3 ) of packaged materia\\.\nAll slugs are the same diameter. The bin is about 60 by\n6 m and weighs 40 tons complete with conveyors. This\nunit is not pressurized, but is emplaced in a trench\nroofed with Kevlar over stays and covered by 3 m of\nlunar soil.\nPackaging of each slug is accomplished by compressing 3.8 kg of material to 500 bars pressure (about twice\nthe base-pressure in the slug at 10 4 m/sec 2 acceleration)\nand then sealing in a 2-l1m thick package of Kevlar which\nis then aluminized. Approximately 2 bars of bag tension\nis provided. Material compression requires 17 kW at the\n30,000 tons/yr production rate. All grains packaged are\nless than I mm diameter. It is estimated the packaging\nunit may consume as much as 400 kW during full operation. Each slug is weighed and sized prior to delivery to\nthe stockpile conveyor. In addition, the packaging units\naccept bulk soil from the two excavation trucks, screen\nthe soil to remove non friable rocks larger than 1 mm,\n\n214\n\nand dump the larger rocks by means of conveyors, in a\nsmall crater or returns them as fill to the soil pit.\nThe initial soil pit operation is very small by terrestrial standards. The solettas allow continuous operations\nand one small truck (10 tons inert mass, 30 ton payload) is able to satisfy the 30,000 ton/yr input requirement with 3 to 4 trips per terrestrial day, allowing only\n80 percent availability. Considerable time is available for\nhauling. Three other vehicles are available and are generally involved in site preparation for expansion of the\nbase, including leveling for future solar cell arrays and\ntrenclling for new facilities. Most of these highly repetitive operations are controlled from Earth. These trucks\nwere used extensively in the emplacement operation and\nwill receive far more use as the base expands. A conveyor system is to be introduced to accommodate the\n600,000 tons/yr operation. Naturally, the remotely\noperating machine used for the preparatory excavations\nprior to manual landings has been dispatched on a route\nof unmanned scientific exploration. All the vehicles are\npowered by tlywheels scaled to about 150 kW output.\nRepowering is provided from the main solar array (Vajk\net aI., p. 61).\nMaintenance and repair for the trucks, major sections\nof the mass drivers, and other equipment, is done in a\npressurizable and outfitted hydrogen/oxygen shuttle\ntank (item 7, fig. 3). It is equipped with a large air lock\nwhich can accept 3-m-diameter objects and has a clearable depth of 22 m. The back bulkhead contains an air\nlock and covers a bunk area and control system for\ndepressurization operations and equipment which should\nnot be subjected to vacuum. A 100-m-Iong approach\nramp allows truck access to the main air lock and is\nstabilized with a binder to minimize dust entry to the\nmaintenance facility. Mass of the facility is about\n40 tons and it draws an average 150 kW.\nCryogenics storage (item 9, fig. 3) is provided in the\npermanently shadowed area under the eastward-facing\nmirror attached to the main solar array. Chemical\nrockets touchdown on a 100 m diameter landing pad\n(item 10) of stabilized lunar soil located 5 km to the\nsouth. Stabilization is required to prevent dust disturbance which obscures the landing and might coat the\nsolar array and heat radiators at the lunar base. There are\nstabilized haul roads between the landing PJd, mJintenance and loading facilities, packaging unit and the pit\n(itemll).\nThe Habitat (item 8) is the residence and communications and control center of the base. It houses the\n10 personnel who stay on station for 6 months, but\n50 percent of whom are rotated every 3 months, either\n\nto Earth or to the space manufacturing facility (SMF).\nIn effect, the lunar crew is an extension of a terrestrial\ncontrol center which operates and monitors equipment\nround-the-clock for both site preparation operations by\nthe remotely-controlled excavators and mass-driver operations. No estimate is provided here of the necessary\nterrestrial manning level. It is noted that studies of the\ndegree of possible automation and man-hours/operating\nhours of the major lunar units are required and afford a\nvery real opportunity for spinoff to many economically\nsignificant tasks on the Earth. Possible examples of terrestrial application include development of remote operation of Earth moving equipment for excavation and\nleveling, systems monitoring and control of undersea oil\nproduction or glass production, quality inspection of\nagglomerated materials (encased) by thin films. Joint\nNASA/industry workshops on specific topics would\nclearly be appropriate. There is high bandwidth continuous communications between the terrestrial center and\nthe lunar crew complete with a full-color, wall-sized\ntelevision system for weekly staff meetings between the\nentire lunar crew and the terrestrial staff and, as necessary, the staff at the SMF. Basic functional volumes in\nthe habitat are: (1) communications and control center;\n(2) main (TV screen) and adjacent recreational rooms;\n(3) galley and dining area; (4) 12 private rooms; (5) storage locker; and (6) the life-support room. The habitat is\nsimilar in design to those employed in low Earth orbit\nand at the SMF with modifications necessary for horizontal emplacement beneath the lunar surface.\nTwo unmanned trim stations (items If and 1g, fig. 3)\nare located 3 km and 150 km downrange from the mass\ndriver. Only the long, but lightweight correction tube is\npresent above the surface at each station. Some consideration was given to placing the trim stations behind\nrevetments. However, occasional misses by 3.8 kg slugs\nmoving 2.4 km/sec generate large craters and would\nrequire major revetment repairs. Instead, the supporting\nmechanisms for the initial correction tubes were\ndesigned to pull the correction tubes into a trench and\nbeneath the surface in 1/20 sec if a bag is observed either\nto rupture or to be badly off course on leaving the mass\ndriver. Small blast deflectors are designed into the front\nof each of the trenches to insure that all the debris will\npass over the recessed correction tube.\nThe lunar supply base would offer a viewer a slowly\nchanging scene of mirrors following the Sun during the\nday and the solettas at night. The steady expansion of\nscratch marks on the lunar surface by the mining operation contrast to the occasional quick hops downward by\nthe 100-m-Iong, but lightweight, correction tubes to\n\navoid certain destruction by a direct hit by one or more\nmisejected bags of lunar soil. The fast action, the packaged slugs of soil leaving the Moon at 2.4 km/sec, would\nnot be visible until the launch rate exceeded 4 or 5 per\nsecond. At that time one could stand underneath the\nentry tube to the first trim station and see a sparkling\nline of light, something like a stream of water, wobble its\nway into the mouth of the correction tube. On exiting,\nthe stream would be rock steady and point arrowlike to\nthe eastern horizon and the location of the final trim\nstation. Persistence of vision would tie the thousands of\nseparate slugs into a faint pipeline of light leaving the\nMoon. A strobe light shining across the exit mouth of\nthe initial trim station could be flashed in synchrony\nwith the exiting packages of soil to produce the visual\nillusion at night of a single, slightly blurry bag of soil\nsuspended above the ground. Of course, over the interval\nof 1.25 min the illusion would be composed of the\nreflections from about 1000 soil packets at an ejection\nrate of 600,000 metric tons each year.\n\nIMPLACEMENT STRATEGIES\nFive general considerations influence the design and\noperation of the initial base suggested in this study:\n(l) need for continuous operation in order to minimize\nthe size of the initial and final base; (2) maximum use of\nremote control and assistance from a terrestrial control\ncenter of as much of the process monitoring, equipment\nstatus, vehicle guidance (e.g., mining), administrative\nassistance, and problem analysis as is possible; (3) all\ninitial units should be constructed as separate plugtogether units which are as large as possible and still\nconvenient to land, manipulate, and place and plug\ntogether in the quickest possible time by a minimum\ncrew; (4) the mass driver, sieving/packaging units should\nbe scaled to handle 600,000 tons/yr; and (5) the basic\noperating crew should have as their main functions maintenance and site preparation for future expansions. All\naspects of the design, emplacement, and operation of the\nbase are greatly facilitated if continuous sunlight is available at the base. Thus, four 8.7-km-diameter mirrors in\ncontinuously illuminated orbits about the Moon are\nassumed to be operational before emplacement of the\nfirst major units of the base. These mirrors are discussed\nin the "Soletta" section.\nExpansion of throughput by a factor of 20 (from\n30,000 to 600,000 tons/yr) can be accomplished\nthrough three steps: (1) steady additions of nine more\n7.2 MW solar arrays (each supplemented by three surface\n\n215\n\nmirrors); (2) addition of a mineral separation facility,\nhaul trucks and a fiberglass/aluminum facility for the\nproduction of bags for packaging the soil slugs; and\n(3) enlargement of the orbiting mirror arrays to provide\nconstant solar illumination during the lunar night. Total\nmass of the mature lunar operation should be less than\n3000 tons on the lunar surface and 8640 tons of solar\nreflectors in lunar orbit. Total base personnel should\nincrease to about 50 at the end of the 5-year growth\nphase, requiring additional habitats.\nThe following scenario for deployment of the initial\nbase following site selection is predicated on the extensive development and checkout on Earth and possibly in\nEarth orbit, of the unitized (plug-together) base which is\nshipped as two major freight subsystems from low Earth\norbit (LEO) to low lunar orbit (LLO) by the first massdriver tug. The mass-driver tugs have payloads of approximately 1300 tons from LEO to LLO. Similar problems\nwere faced in development of the petroleum fields on\nthe North Slope of Alaska. Habitats weighing up to\n800 tons were preassembled in Seattle, Washington and\nshipped to the North Slope and installed in 4 months on\nprereadied sites (ref. 12).\nEach freight unit is soft-landed (300 to 600 tons) as a\nsingle unit following LLO insertions (ref. 13). Freight\nunit no. 1 contains two automated (Earth-controlled)\nexcavation units. On landing, these units unload themselves, assist in unfurling from the landing vehicle two\n150 kW solar arrays, which operate electrolysis units for\nregeneration of fuel cell hydrogen and oxygen (or\nrecharging flywheel power units), and then proceed for\nthe next 7 months under terrestrial control to make the\nmajor leveling excavations for the mass driver, processing\nunits, large solar array, and habitats. These excavation\nunits will be operated exclusively for site preparation for\nthe 5-year period of base development. The mass driver\nimmediately returns to Earth after deploying the first\nfreight unit. Freight unit no. 2 and the construction\nforce of 25 persons (personnel transported by chemical\nrocket from LEO) arrive 7 months later and begin\nemplacing the various units over a 4-month period. The\norbi tal mass-driver tug immediately returns to Earth\nafter deploying two catcher/freight units at L2.\nBase construction would consist of the following\ndeployment sequence: (1) on lunar day 1 - habitat and\nmaintenance emplacement and coverage, start of solar\narray emplacement, layout of the 23 major accelerator\nunits and 200 coast sections of the mass driver along the\nexcavation for the track; (2) on lunar day 2 - emplacement of the solar array completed, mass-driver layout\ncompleted, assembly of the thermal and dust tunnel\n\n216\n\nprogresses with mass-driver assembly, assembly of the\ninitial trim-facility completed, and emplacement of the\nscreening/packaging facility completed; (3) on lunar\nday 3 - crew of 6 translates to the site of the final trim\nfacility to prepare the site and emplace the unit (2 lunar\ndays for job), assembly of mass driver is complete and\nalignment and test shots are made following completion\nof work at the remote site and deployment of surface\nmirrors is started; and (4) on lunar day 4 - emplacement\nof surface mirrors and the final trim station is completed\nand full operational tests are conducted. At the end of\nlunar day 4, the remote crew returns to the lunar base\nand the 15 construction workers then return to Earth.\nAt the start of lunar day 5, 1 year after touchdown of\nfreight unit no. 1, the lunar base is ejecting during the\nday bulk lunar soil to the two catcher/transporters\nwhich can transfer 2300 tons/lunar month of bulk lunar\nsoil to the SMF by 1 year after the start of lunar base\nconstruction. This soil will be useful for reaction mass,\nshielding, checkout of the mineral dressing and chemical\nprocessing equipment, oxygen generation, and fiberglass\nproduction.\n\nINCREASING CAPACITY AND DECREASING\nUNIT COSTS\nIncreasing the capacity of useful material ejected to\ndeep space requires: (1) the addition of nine more solar\narrays, (2) introduction of soil separation and beneficiation equipment, (3) an increase in the hauling capacity\nfrom the mining areas to the soil processing unit by a\nfactor of 40 to 60, (4) the emplacement of a waste\nmaterial dump system (very likely a fixed conveyor\ndumping into a small crater), and (5) enlarging the orbiting mirrors by a factor of 9 in area. It is possible that the\navailability of lunar samples will permit the design, construction and deployment of electrostatic separators as\npart of the initial soil sieving and packaging unit. If not,\nthe separation units can be added. Installation of the\nseparation unit will allow one to send only the most\nuseful component (83 percent anorthite, 19 percent\nilmenite) of the lunar soil to space, and thus maximize\nraw material input to the SMF for manufacturing AI, Si,\n0, Ti, and Fe. This will be cquivalent to a factor of 3 to\n4 increase in the delivery rate of economically useful\nmaterials. Trucks and/or conveyor systems necessary for\nincreasing the haulage capacity, can be delivered yearly\nfrom Earth. Trucks and conveyors adequate for the task\nwill have a mass less than 60 tons (Williams et ai.,\np.275).\n\nIt is assumed that most of the solar cells and reflectors (surface and orbital) for the additional power units\nwill be produced at the SMF from processed lunar materials and delivered to the Moon for installation. Preassembly and checkout at the SMF of these units is\nassumed so that only site preparation and deployment\nwill be required of the lunar crews. The costs of all of\nthe additional arrays (factor of 20 increase in power)\nshould be less than the cost of the original 7.2 MW unit.\nIt is possible that the additional solar arrays will be\ncenter-mounted on tall support columns and actively\ndirected toward the Sun. This involves much stronger\nsupport columns than the mirrors, but almost eliminates\nsite preparation, makes tracking of the solettas more\nprecise, and maintains a lower temperature for the array.\nCost per unit ($/kg) of the delivered materials can be\nprogressively reduced by: (I) installation of a plant for\nthe production of a bagging material made of fiberglass/\naluminum composite; (2) use of liquid oxygen produced\nin space from lunar materials and stored in low lunar\norbit for the lunar landing rocket; (3) recovery at the\nlunar surface of hydrogen and oxygen from lunar fines\n(see Williams et aI., p. 275); (4) facility for the fabrication of pressure vessels, structural materials and other\nredundant items from the fiberglass/aluminum composite and locally produced ceramics and glasses (especially foundations and stabilized soils); and (5) increasing the "closure" ratio of the life-support systems. By\nthe end of year 5 of base operations, the operating costs\nshould be dominated by crew rotation costs, salaries and\nmaintenance expenses (excluding capital investment of\nfurther expansion operations).\nApproximately 1 ton of liquid oxygen is required to\nland 1.2 tons of payloads on the lunar surface from low\nlunar orbit and return a lunar shuttle to low lunar orbit\n(Vajk et aI., p. 61). It is not clear at t.his time whether\nthe oxygen production can best take place at the SMF,\nthe lunar base, or both, but any of these options in\neffect increases the useful payload fraction of mass\ndriver freighter to the Moon by a factor of 2. Thus, very\nlarge cost savings are possible by quickly initiating production of liquid oxygen from lunar materials for use in\noperations between the lunar surface and low-lunar\norbit.\n\nPACKAGING OF THE LUNAR MATERIALS\nEach unit of lunar soil ejected from the Moon must\nbe contained in a thin, aluminized packet. This packet\nmust contain the powdery material for mechanical handling, prevent breakup of the slug and dust generation\n\nduring ejection by the mass driver, and accept uniform\nelectrical charging for electrostatic velocity trims and\nhigh radar and optical reflectivity. In addition, there\nmust be uniformity of packaging from one slug to the\nnext with respect to trajectory perturbations by light\npressure, the solar wind, and magnetic and gravity gradients. The packages must break apart uniformly for\nremoval of the encapsulated material, and the packet\nmaterial should be useful for either recycling to the\nMoon or in some other derivative application. Packaging\nmust be done in a vacuum so that no outgassing will\noccur during the coasting phase which would perturb the\ntrajectory of the slug of lunar material. The total mass of\nbagging material used each year (Mb) is related to the\no\ntotal mass of lunar material to be ejected each year (M)\nby\nMb = 2M(p\'/p) \xe2\x80\xa2 (LV\'/y) [(4 + L/R)/(L/R - 2/3)]\n\nfor cylindrical slugs (ignoring slight taper of the cylinder\nof soil) with hemispherical end caps where R is radius of\nthe cylinder, L is the length of the cylinder, LV\' is the\npressure the bag applies to hold the slug of soil together,\nY is the yield stress of the bag material, p\' is the density\nof the bagging material, and p is the density of the\ncompressed lunar soil. Thus, to first order the required\nmass of bagging material is independent of the size of\nthe slugs (m) made of the ejected lunar material. The\nmass of one bag (mb) is simply\n\nwhere N is the number of slugs produced each year.\nBag pressure will be adjusted to about 2 bars (a factor\nof lOin bag yield strength is included for safety), the\nbulk lunar soil compressed to a density of about\n2.2 g/cm 3 , and L/R"\'" 12.66 for the present lunar mass\ndriver. The compression requires a pressure of about\n500 bars and is twice the pressure the lunar material will\nexperience at the base of the slug during the 10 4 m/sec 2\nacceleration from the Moon. There should be negligible\nrebound of the material following acceleration termination or ejection from the bucket. Grinding between soil\ngrains in the bag should provide a sink for vibratory and\ncompressive disturbances during launch and release. A\ncontinuous power supply of about 17 kW is needed for\nthe compression of 30,000 tons/year of slugs. Clearly,\nthe bagging material cannot sustain the full stresses of\nthe 1000 g (\xc2\xb160 g\'s transverse) launch environment. It is\nassumed that the bucket will be designed to securely\ncontain the bag of soil against these accelerations without tearing the bag, permitting a smooth axial release of\n\n217\n\nthe bag at the launch (ejection point) and a means of\ncontaining bags which do not eject.\nIn order to keep the base design and functions simple\nat first, it is appropriate and economically reasonable to\nimport the packaging material from Earth. A high\nstrength synthetic such as Kevlar (Y"" 34,000 bar and\np\' "" 1.5 g/cm 3 ) seems completely adequate. The total\nmass of bagging for 30,000 tons of ejected mass would\nbe about 33 tons. This is an acceptable penalty for initial\noperations. However, as the operations increase in scale,\nit becomes desirable to install a plant on the Moon to\nproduce an aluminum/fiberglass composite sheet. It is\nassumed that the fiberglass will be produced on the\nMoon and the aluminum returned from the SMF by the\nstart of the second year of operation of the lunar base.\nAssuming the composite has a yield stress of about\n10,000 bar (ref. 14), then one must manufacture 2.2 kg\nof packaging material on the Moon for every ton of\nejected materials or 1320 tons/yr for 600,000 tons/yr of\nejected material.\nDetails of lunar fiberglass production from lunar\nmaterials are discussed in a companion paper (Ho and\nSobon). A 10-20 percent increase in the capacity of this\nproduction facility and the addition of fabrication shops\nwould permit the construction of a large number of\nitems for subsequent expansion of the lunar base such as\nlarge pressure vessels, structural fiberglass composites,\nelectrical cable, glass and ceramic structural elements,\npipes, acoustic panels, and so on. A fiberglass production\nfacility adequate to produce 3000 tons/yr of finished\nfiber should have a mass of less than 100 tons. Lay-up\nand fabrication facilities should have a mass of about\n70-100 tons. Refer to Criswell (ref. 15) for a general\noutline of material flow for production of bags on the\nlunar surface.\n\nLUNAR BASE POWER REQUIREMENTS\nIdeally, all operations concerned with the lunar\nmining and mass ejection should be conducted continuously with only scheduled maintenance shutdowns. In\nthis manner the base could be about one-half the size\nrequired for an operation conducted only during the\nlunar day. Continuous opcration is only possible if a\nsource of continuous power is available. Continuous\npower could be obtained by increasing the size of the\nsolar array and storing power for nigllttime operations in\nfuel cells, flywheels, or batteries. Flywheels appear to\nprovide the highest energy density and infinite recycling\nbut impose a weight penalty slightly less than 1.2 to\n\n218\n\n1.3 kg/kW-hr including transport fuel for delivery to the\nMoon (P. Vajk, p.61). Other schemes, such as a nuclear\npower plant (legal problems) or a space power platform\nbeaming microwaves to the Moon (depend on start of\nSPS production) appear less than optimal initially. It is\nsuggested here that mirrors orbiting the Moon and\nreflecting sunlight to the base during lunar night may be\na reasonable solution. First, an overview of the power\nconsumption is presented.\nThe major blocks of power which must be provided\nfor operation of the minimum base are, first, for the\nejection of 30,000 tons/yr (0.967 kg/sec con tinuously)\nof material during the lunar day (0.5 duty cycle of the\nlunar day) and, secondly, for the mining and packaging\noperations which are best conducted continuously\n(Williams et aI., p. 275). Notice that 2.9XI06 J/kg are\nrequired to accelerate material to the 2.4 km/sec ejection velocity. Assuming the mass driver is 96 percent\nefficient in converting electrical energy into ejection\nenergy and 10 percent of the daytime ejection period\n(0.9 operating fraction per terrestrial day) is lost due to\nmaintenance downtime the average input power (P(MD\xc2\xbb\nis:\n6\nP(MD) = (0.967 kg/sec)(2.88\xc2\xb710 J/sec) = 64MW\n(0.5) (0.9) (0.96)\n.\nApproximately 2.2X I 0 9 W-hr are required during each\nlunar day for mass driver operation. It is clear that the\nmass driver control system must be designed to accept a\ncontinuously changing launch rate of payloads in order\nto avoid the penalty of very large power smoothing\nunits. Base operations are anticipated to require the\nfollowing units of power: Habitat ~ (16 kW/person,\n10 persons) "" 160 kW; trucks ~ 250 kW; sieving, packaging, and maintenance facility and miscellaneous power\nrequirement ~ 400 kW for a total continuous input of\nP(B) = 800 kW. About 5.4X I 0 8 W-hr of electrical energy\nare required for operation of the base, exclusive of the\nmass driver, each lunar month. This corresponds to\n20 percent of the total monthly power input of the solar\narray. Thus, the average daytime power requirement is\nPo = 7.2 MW, whereas the nighttime requirement is\nabout an order of magnitude less at P(N) = 0.8 MW.\n\nIt is assumed that the power will be provided by a\nsolar cell array (E = 0.1 efficient in solar to electrical\nenergy conversion efficiency including power conditioning; 15 tons/MW area power density). Two innovations\nare suggested to minimize the size of the solar array and\nthe capacity of power storage devices (e.g., fuel cells,\nflywheels). First, the solar array will be surrounded on\n\nthree sides by three lightweight mirrors which are independently adjustable from the horizontal to 45\xc2\xb0 local\nvertical. These mirrors are of width equal to that of the\nside length Ls of the square array and a length of\nh = 1.414 Ls. Second, two to three orbiting mirrors will\nprovide reflected sunlight during the lunar night adequate to operate the base (0.8 MW), but not the mass\ndriver. By the third year of base operations, these orbiting mirrors (solettas) can be increased in size by a factor\nof 9 using fiberglass and aluminum from the SMF; this\nwill permit operation of the mass driver during the lunar\nnight and thus increase the mass ejection capacity of the\nbase by a factor of 2 with little or no additional ground\ninstallations.\nFigure 4 depicts the power profile for the solar array/\nmirror system augmented by soletta illumination at\nnight. Region 1 corresponds to a sine dependence of the\npower output of the flat solar array, between sunrise and\nsunset. The total watt-hours (WH) output in region 1 is\n(2/n )PoLd (length of lunar day) where Po = 7.2 MW.\nActually, the sine distribution of output power would\nnot be realized due to increasing external reflection and\nscattering of the incident sunlight back to space as the\nillumination angle of the solar cells approached the horizontal (0\xc2\xb0). However, use of the mirrors greatly\nimproves the power input because the sunlight is then\nnever incident on the solar cells at less than 45\xc2\xb0. Continuous adjustment of the elevation angles of the mirrors\non the western and eastern edges of the solar array\nallows the reflection of sunlight onto the array to produce additional power in region 2. Lunar reflectors are\n\n-I-\n\nDAY\n\n15\n\nt, 12\n13\n\n3:\n~\n\n11\n\n:\n\nNIGHT\n\nI\n\nSIN\'E CURVE\nADJUSTED FOR 10%\nREFLECTION\nLOSSES\n\n1-\' 10\n\n~\n\n9\nI- 8\n\n~\n\n7\n\nII:\n\n6\n\n3:\n~\n\n4\n\nw\n\n5\n\neffective whereas times-2 solar concentrators are not\ncompetitive with solar cells alone for space power stations since they can be continuously directed toward the\nSun (ref. 16). The Lunar case is different in that the\n"times-2" concentration need only occur (optional)\nabout lunar noon. Otherwise, the concentrators suggested here simply maintain the solar radiation to the\nsolar array at a high value (;;;\'1 solar constant) throughout the lunar day. Let E (=0,1) be the con version efficiency of solar energy into electrical output of the array\nand allow for 10 percent average reflection losses (c) at\nthe mirrors and the surface of the solar array, then we\ncan estimate the area (As) of the solar array (where\nPs = 1.4XI0 3 MW/km is the solar constant) to be:\n\nFor the stated values of the quantities in the equation\nwe have\n\nAs ~ 0.0327 km2 ,\n\nLs = 181 m\n\nThe mass of the solar array would be 108 tons. The mass\nof the three adjustable mirrors, support beams and hoisting mechanisms would be about 18 tons (E. Bock, Convair, San Diego) using two compression beams and\nside beams for each mirror and cable hoists. Reflectors\nare useful for power conditioning on the lunar surface,\nin spite of the large area of the reflectors, due to low\ngravity and lack of weather and weathering effects. This\napproach would be impractical terrestrially. Major future\nconsiderations in evaluation of this approach are\n(1) effects of running the solar cell array at two solar\nconcentrations for about 1/4 of the lunar day and\n(2) conditioning of the front surface of the solar arrays\nto minimize reflection of sunlight at small angles of\nincidence. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to\ncenter-mount the array (or a segmented array) on a\ntower of height one-half the length of the array and\npoint the array continuously toward the Sun or the\nparticular soletta providing nighttime illumination. Use\nof a tower would allow the solar cells to operate at lower\ntemperatures during the lunar day.\n\n3\n2\n\no SUNRISE\n\nSUNSET\n\nSUNRISE\n\nFigure 4.- Power profile of the lunar base during a com-\n\nplete lunar month (power consumption in megawatts,\nvertical axis; time past sunrise, horizontal axis).\n\nRegion 3 (sunrise and sunset) corresponds to either\nthe east or west mirror viewing the Sun while the general\nterrain is dark. Some power can be received during this\ntime due to the slow rotation of the Moon and the large\nheight of the mirrors (Lh "\'" 260 m). The time interval\n(ti) between sunset at the base and the top of the mirror\nat the equator for a spherical moon is given by\n\n219\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nwhere e ~ 0.53\xc2\xb0 /hr is the rotation rate of the Moon,\nR = 1738 km (radius of the Moon), Lh is the vertical\ndimension of the array, and ct> the angle of the mirror\nwith respect to the direction to the local sunset direction\n(=45\xc2\xb0). Thus, for Lh = 260 m we have ti = 1.57 hI. The\npre-sunrise and post-sunset operations can add as much\nas\n2X(1/2)(7.2 MW)(1.57 hr)\n\n= 0.11 X lOB W-hr\n\nLarge elevation difference are available in the lunar\nhighlands. It is not unreasonable to expect that one\ncould locate mountain peaks within 30 km of the base\nsite which might be 2 km higher than the base. The\npeaks would be exposed to the Sun at least 5.2 hr longer\nthan the base and possibly much longer if the local\neastern and western horizons are significantly depressed\nbelow the horizon of the spherical Moon. Reflectors on\nthe scale of 600 m (length) by 300 m (height) adjustable\nover 95\xc2\xb0\nazimuth could contribute at least\n0.74X 10 8 W-hr to the nighttime power budget or\nincrease the operating time of the mass driver by 3 percent or more. Such surface mirrors could contribute\n2 percent to 14 percent to the estimated nighttime\nenergy budget of 2.7XIOB kW-hr indicated as region 4 in\nfigure 4, depending on local geometry.\nAn interesting option to conventional solar cells may\nbe available for use on the Moon by using photoemission\nand/or thermionic emission. The basic power unit would\nconsist of three aluminum strips which could be vapor\ndeposited on the bottom and sides of a rectangular\ntrench (possibly 3 or 4 cm wide and deep, and about\n1 m long). The trench, one of tens of thousands of\nidentical closely spaced trenches, would be oriented with\nits long axis in the east-west direction. The bottom of\nthe trench would next be evaporatively coated with a\nphotoemissive/thermionic material. Sunlight would produce a now of electrons from the trench bottom to the\nsides evoking a small potential difference which can be\nregulated to control the current flow and thus maximize\nthe power output. The mass of the aluminum and electron emissive materials required would be trivial compared to the equivalent areal mass of solar cells, whereas\nthe mass of ancillary parallel and series hook-up wire and\npower conditioning equipment should be similar to that\nneeded for solar cells. Conversion efficiencies of about\n5 percent are thought to be possible (ref. 17). This\n\n220\n\nphoto-similar effect is likely to operate naturally on the\nMoon in the levitation of lunar dust (refs. 18, 19).\nFurther experimental and theoretical research is needed\nand should be given high priority for application not\nonly to lunar surface operations, but also for possible\nspace power systems which could be constructed largely\nof lunar materials.\nAs noted earlier, about 400 tons of power storage\nunits (1.2-1.5 kW-hr/kg) would be required to power\nthe station over one lunar night. In addition, about\n300 tons of propellant would be required to soft-land\nthe extra mass. Finally, as base activities increased, the\nstorage capacity would increase linearly with the scale of\nnighttime operations. Total mass of power storage units\ncould approach 6000 tons on the lunar surface and\n4000 tons of propellant in LLO for delivery. For these\nr;.!asons, the alternative approach of deploying large\nmirrors in lunar orbit which could power, illuminate,\nand warm the base at night and permit 24 hr a day\noperation even during the lunar night, is suggested.\n\nSOLETTAS\nBillman et al. (ref. 9) and Ehricke (ref. 8) both\nproposed that large mirrors be orbited about the Earth\nto illuminate cities, agricultural regions, ice fields blocking navigation, and solar power installations. Orbiting\nmirrors are far better suited for lunar than terrestrial use\ndue to the absence of a lunar atmosphere, availability of\ncontinuously illuminated lunar orbits, the long period of\nsuch lunar orbits, relatively small change in slant range\nduring the illuminating period, and the option of precessing the apolune of each mirror over the cycle of the\nlunar month in order to keep the apolune over the\nlongitude of the lunar base (David Ross, Stanford Univ.,\nAeronautics and Astronautics Dept., personal communication). The amount of reflective area required in space\nis independent (to first order) of the altitude of the\nsolettas for continuous coverage. The fundamental\ndesign constraint is that the minimum size of spot (Ds)\non the ground is determined by the angular size of the\nSun (0:= 9.3X10- 3 rad) and the slant range (h) between\nthe orbiting mirror and the ground spot where Ds = ho:.\nThe mirrors must be constructed of individual flat\nsegments or submirrors which must be individually\ndirected toward the desired ground spot. Submirror size\nis limited by the required flatness of the mirror surface.\nThe segments can be directed toward a reference laser\nbeam at the receiving site. For one solar constant of\nillumination the mirror must be the size of the ground\n\nspot; therefore, the diameter of the mirror (DM) will\nalso be DM = hOi.. In the lunar case the use of the three\nmovable mirrors on the ground (or a tilting solar array)\nwhich surround each solar array will permit considerable\nsmoothing and effective concentration of the solar\npower to the array in response to non-normal incidence\nof the sunlight reflected to the site by the orbiting\nmirrors. The three ground mirrors become more effective as the maximum viewing angle of the orbiting mirrors above the local horizon increases. Use of ground\nmirrors or tilting arrays avoids increasing the size of the\norbiting mirror above DM = hOi.. However, attention must\nbe given to array spacing on the lunar surface as the\nground installation grows in order to insure that there is\nno significant shadowing of portions of the array by\nforeground units.\nThe suggested lunar system consists of four solettas\ntrailing each other along a high inclination, low altitude\norbit. It is assumed the initial solettas are sized to\nprovide one\xc2\xb7ninth solar illumination (average) to the\narrays to power the lunar base through the night. These\none-ninth solettas would be constructed in low-Earth\norbit from components supplied from Earth. Figure 5\ndepicts the low altitude, high inclination orbit. In this\nexample, the average slant range is 2800 km and\n\n=D M = 26 km. For the initial one\xc2\xb7ninth solar illumination at the base Ds = 8.7 km. A slight increase of the\neccentricity of this orbit would permit overlap of the\nviewing periods (57.2 min; 24.4 percent of the orbit).\nDecreasing the inclination of the orbit increases viewing\ntime but also the slant range to the base and therefore\nrequires an increased mirror size.\nFour mirrors, each about 40 km 2 area (240 tons per\nmirror at 6 g/m 2 ), could meet the overnight power needs\nof the base and prevent the extremely prolonged cold\nsoak of lunar night by providing one\xc2\xb7ninth the full solar\nconstant. For an orbit with a perilune of 500 km, apo\xc2\xb7\n0\nlune of 1610 km, and inclination of 33.3 , each mirror\nwould rise in the southwest (or northwest), attain a\n0\nmaximum elevation of 20 in the south ( or north), set in\nthe southeast, and be visible above the horizon for\n57.2 min per orbit (24 percent of the 3.9\xc2\xb7hr orbit). The\nprojected spot from such a satellite would be extremely\nelongated due to the low sighting angles. However, the\nthree ground mirrors could be continually reconfigured\nto reflect soletta light into the collecting array thus\nobviating the low ill umina tion angle. Assuming the\nlaunch costs ($650/kg) to an Earth orbit of altitude\ngreater than 1000 km dominate the production and\nassembly costs of the mirrors, an investment of\n\nDs\n\n--------------r\n\ns\n\nLUNAR\n---.-----+-----?~~--~r_-L-7~---L----~rl_------~~~~~b_-------J------~ EQUATORIAL\n\nPLANE\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\~~~~~~~~--------------~~--~~~\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\'\\\n\nGIVEN: 2 = 1738 km\nJ...= 500km\nW 1838km\n8 = 30\xc2\xb0\n\n\\\n\n\\~\n1~\n\n2\n\n/\'\n\nTHEN <p = 33.3\xc2\xb0\n9 = 2737 km SEMIMINOR AXIS\n3 = 3348 km\n\'" = 43.9\xc2\xb0 - HALF ANGLE OF\n4 = 555 km\nVISI BI LlTY\n5 = 2793 km (SEMIMAJOR AXIS) @-POSITION OF THE LUNAR\nBASE\n6 = 2122 km (SLANT RANGE AT\nAPOLUNE)\n8= 1055km\nSUMMARY SEMIMAJOR AXIS - 2793 km (a)\nSEMIMINOR AXIS - 2737 km (b)\nECCENTRICITY = cIa = 0.1987\nFOCUS DISPLACEMENT = 555 km\nINCLINATION = 33.3\xc2\xb0\n\nVISIBLE\nPORTION\nOF THE\nORBIT\n1------~~~~~--~---4--__------~\n\nj\n\n87.8\xc2\xb0\n57.2 min\n\nORBITAL\nPLANEOF\nMIRRORS\n\n___ \'::\'_0""\' 0",\'"\n_ __\n\nFigure 5.- Three views of a low altitude soletta orbit about the moon. Four 8.7-km diameter solettas would be\nrequired to provide overlapping illumination of the base with one-ninth solar constant input to the solar array.\n\n221\n\n$624 million would be required for the initial orbiting\nnetwork. This cost could be reduced sharply by utilizing\nthe aluminum in shuttle tanks in the mirror structure.\nSavings in base construction time, continuous equipment\nusage, and minimization of power conditioning and storage should justify the expense. The mirrors would transport themselves by solar sailing from Earth orbit to low\nlunar orbit and might be used to transfer significant\npayloads as well to lunar orbit depending on the time\nconstraints. It will be necessary to continually track and\nsolar-sail the solettas. There must be a con tinual reconfiguring of the individual sub mirrors during the lunar\ndaytime portion of the orbit and when the base is on the\nday side in order to utilize solar pressure to maintain the\nproper orbital elements. Presumably this can be a highly\nautomated process.\nNASA programs for solar-sail development have\nestablished the characteristics of a large space mirror\nconstructed out of aluminum and plastics which could\nbe deployed in the mid-1980\'s. Areal densities as low as\n6 g/m 2 can be expected (refs. 20-22). Thus, one low\naltitude soletta providing full solar illumination at the\nlunar surface would have a mass\nMs = (6 tons/km 2)(rr/4)(26 km)2 = 3185 tons. Extensive\nuse could be made of fiberglass and aluminum from the\ninitial production runs at the SMF to produce the full\nsize solettas for final production expansion of the lunar\nsupply base. If a technique can be developed to produce\nthin-film aluminum without a substrate, then very little\nmaterial would have to be broUght from the Earth. The\nsolettas could be sailed directly from the SMF to lunar\norbit without the expenditure of reaction mass or\nenergy.\nThe relative efficiency of the solettas in providing\nenergy increases as the size of the lunar base increases to\nfill the 26-km diameter of the minimum illuminated\nspot. The initial installation on the lunar surface utilizes\nonly 9X 10-s of the incident sunlight and the\n600,000 tons/yr installation 2X I 0 -3 of the incident sunlight. Thus, a soletta system could support the ejection\nof up to 3.4X 10 8 tons/yr of lunar material with a base\ninstallation of 45 to 50 percent less total mass than\nwithout the orbital reflector system.\n\ncosts, development and deployment times and designing\nhighly automated systems capable of maintaining continuous high throughput of soil into space.

SOBON\n\nA conceptual design is presented for fiberglass production systems in both lunar and space environments. The raw\nmaterial, of lunar origin, will be plagioclase concentrate, high silica content slag, and calcium oxide. Glass will be melted\nby solar energy. The multifurnace in the lunar plant and the spinning cylinder in the space plant are unique design features. Furnace design appears to be the most critical element in optimizing system performance. A conservative estimate of the total power generated by solar concentrators is 1880 k W; the mass of both plants is 120 tons. The systems\nwill reproduce about 90 times their total mass in fiberglass in 1 year. A new design concept would be necessary if glass\nrods were produced in space.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS\n\nFiberglass is an ideal material for use in space construction: It can be used for weaving cylindrical massdriver containers (ref. 1) and for electrical insulation,\nand for manufacturing many lunar and space structural\ncomponents such as reinforced plastic structural panels,\nlarge fiberglass cylinders, and small-diameter tubing for\nstruts. The more desirable properties of fiberglass are\n(ref. 2):\n1. High tensile-strength/weight ratio, with tensile\nstrength ranging from 2X 10 9 to 3.5X 10 9 N/m2\n(300,000 to 500,000 psi)\n2. Excellent stability: durable, dimensionally stable,\nand corrosion-resistant to moisture, most alkalis, and\nacids\n3. Good thermal properties: incombustible, with low\ncoefficient of thermal expansion; most fiberglass maintains 50 percent of its original tensile strength at 700 K\n4. Excellent electrical insulation characteristics: low\ndielectric constants and high dielectric strength\nThe purpose of this study was to show, in concept,\nthat fiberglass can be prepared from lunar materials and\nto define the design of an effective system for such\nproduction.\n\nFiberglass can be produced from materials available\nfrom lunar soil directly and from by-products of aluminum and titanium extractions:\n1. Anorthite, CaAl2 Si 2Os: the main part of the\nplagioclase concentrate obtained by beneficiation of\nlunar soil.\n2. Slag (Si0 2 ~ 75 percent; Al2 0 3 ~ 15 percent;\nCaO + MgO ~ 10 percent): a by-product of aluminum\nextraction from plagioclase based on the following\nreaction:\n\n= 2AlCI 3 (g) + CaCh(s) + 2SiCI 4 (g) + 8CO(g)\nSlag is easily extracted since it is the only solid among\nthe products of this reaction.\n3. Calcium oxide, CaO: a by-product of titanium\nproduction (refs. 3,4):\nCaC1 2(s) electrolysi~ Ca(s) + CI 2(g)\n2Ca(s) + Ti0 2 (s) "* 2CaO(s) + Ti(s)\n\n225\n\n---\n\nThe approximate fiberglass composition (by weight)\nto be used is 82-percent slag, 16-percen t CaO, and\n2-percent anorthite (fig. 1). Since the composition can\nbe varied to obtain fiberglass with different properties\nand since the chemical quality of the slag and anorthite\nmay vary, chemical analysis must be made to determine\nthe exact weight percentage of each material before\nmixing. After mixing, the material could be ground into\nfiner grains of similar size. This would minimize the\nmelting time.\nAccording to an analysis of the lunar material extraction process (ref. 4), one unit of lunar soil may yield\n0.59 unit of material suitable for fiberglass production.\nTherefore, for a projected annual processing rate of\n5.5 X \\08 kg (600,000 tons) of lunar soil, 3.2X \\08 kg\n(350 ,000 tons) of material for fiberglass production may\nbe obtained. This amount is more than adequate for a\nthroughput of 9.IXI0 6 kg (10,000 tons) of fiberglass\nper year - the estimated need for the initial buildup of\nlunar and space bases. The remainder of the yearly slag\nproduction would be used to produce shielding material\n\nare that several small furnaces are used and parabolic\nsolar concentrators are installed horizontally pointing\ndown to the lunar surface (fig. 3) for convenience in\nhandling molten material (ref. 5).\n\nProduction of bubble-free glass for continuous fila ment drawing- The raw material is first melted in a\nsmall furnace by the primary solar concentrator. The\nbatch of molten glass is then transferred by conveyor\nbelts to a smaller solar concentrator for fining and\nhomogenizing. (Fining is defined as the minimum heating time to obtain bubble-free, inclusion-free glass.) This\ntwo-step procedure is used because the power for fining\nand homogenizing is only about 30 percent of that\nrequired for melting, and fining and homogenizing are\ntime-consuming processes (ref. 6). Therefore, it is preferable to use several smaller solar concentrators for fining\nand homogenizing so that the primary concentrator can\nbe used full time to melt raw material.

Since the total mass of the\nsystem is about 110X10 3 kg (120 tons}, it will be able\nto process raw material about 90 times its own mass in\n1 year.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAbundant amounts of fiberglass can be produced\nfrom lunar materials.

LEE\n\nThe fabrication of lunar building materials and the assembly of structures requires the use of adhesives, binders, and\nsealants. These terrestrial materials are usually produced from carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, elements scarce on the\nMoon. One possible approach would be to use inorganic polymer systems synthesized from the available lunar chemical\nelements, viz., silicon, aluminum, and oxygen. This paper considers inorganic polymer systems, their background,\nstatus, and shortcomings, and the use of network polymers as a possible approach to synthesis. In addition, other\npotentially useful considerations were advanced, including glassy metals for unusual structural strength, and the use of\ncold-mold materials as well as foam-sintered lunar silicates for lightweight shielding and structural building materials.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIdeally, structural systems assembled on the lunar\nsurface would be fabricated from available lunar materials. This process might include synthesis of adhesives\nfor use in filament winding, sealants, binders for incorporating into lunar road-bed materials to minimize dust\ngeneration, as well as materials for insulation and radiation shielding. However, lunar materials do not contain\nthe abundance of basic chemical elemental building\nblocks available in terrestrial minerals. The lunar composition is dominated by five minerals - pyroxenes, olivines, feldspars, ilmenite, and spinel - and consists\nmainly of metal silicates and titanates. Terrestrial technology concerned with adhesives, sealants, and binders\nrevolves about the ubiquitous carbon atom. All current\nadhesive systems use macromolecular organic polymeric\ncompounds which are produced from carbon containing\nsmall molecules that contain, in addition to carbon,\nhydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Only oxygen, which is\ncombined as oxides and silicates, is relatively abundant\non the Moon, comprising more than 50 percent by\nweight of lunar materials (ref. 1), while the upper limit\n\nof indigenous organics in lunar samples is about 1 ppb\n(ref. 2).\nIn the absence of lunar materials for fabricating\norganic structures, several alternatives were considered:\n1. The simplest but most expensive alternative would\nbe to transport all needed materials by means of the\nSpace Shuttle. The present proposed method for producing aluminum from lunar ores involves the use of carbon\nand chlorine, which would have to be transported to the\nMoon. However, these elements remain captive within\nthe process and need not be constantly replenished as\nwould be the case if organic polymeric adhesives were\nproduced from carbon starting material.\n2. An alternative would be to "dismantle" a carbonaceous containing asteroid into the desired chemical elements. Towing asteroids to a convenient work area is\nunder consideration.\n3. Another alternative would be to use available\nlunar materials with or without a minimum of terrestrial\nmaterials to synthesize and fabricate the required building materials.\nThe purpose of this discussion is to consider alternative 3 and its ramifications.\n\n233\n\nSTATUS OF INORGANIC POLYMERS\nNearly all synthetic plastics and elastomers in use\ntoday are organic polymers. These consist of very large\nmolecules containing linear or branched chains with a\nbackbone of carbon atoms. However, it has been long\nknown that carbon is not a required component of\nmaterials that exhibit plastic behavior. For example,\nplastic sulfur, glassy selenium, and polyphosphonitrilic\nchloride are totally inorganic substances that demonstrate elastomeric properties at moderate temperatures,\nbut are unstable and cannot retain their potentially\nuseful properties for prolonged periods.\nInorganic polymers are defined here as materials composed of long linear chain molecules that do not contain\ncarbon in the chain but may have carbon in the pendant\ngroups or in the side chain. Polymer systems containing\nboth inorganic elements and carbon in the backbone\nstructure are considered to be semiorganic polymers.\nInorganic polymers have been in use a long time; for\nexample, glass is an inorganic polymer comprised of\nrings and chains of repeating silicate units, as are most\nrocks, minerals (including sapphire and ruby), brick,\nconcrete, and ceramics, which are three\xc2\xb7dimensional\ninorganic polymers (cf. fig. 1). In pyroxene, one of the\nmain lunar minerals, similar chains of silicate units are\nfound. Also, ladder polymers or double chains are found\nin amphibole minerals such as one form of asbestos. In\nthis latter type of structure, the negative charges of the\noxygen atoms are neutralized by positively charged\nmetal ions that tend to bind adjacent chains together to\nform a crosslinked matrix (ref. 3). However, these materials have limited use because of the difficulty in fabricating them into useful objects such as those requiring\nhigh temperature. These materials generally are not flexible, elastomeric, or impact-resistant. However, despite\n\nthe difficulties with naturally occurring inorganic polymers, these facts have not precluded further investigation into synthetic inorganic polymer chemistry.\nFor years, chemists have sought a middle ground\nsomewhere between organic polymers on one hand and\nmineralogical inorganic materials on the other. Generally, organic materials cannot resist heat, while inorganics cannot undergo strain. The better material should be\nbetween these extremes. The desired struct ure required\nis postulated to consist of a linearly structured polymer\nwith nonionic substituent groups to favor flexibility.\nThis is the basic concept behind the design of silicone\npolymers, the most solid claim to commercial success of\nan inorganic polymer. The most widely used silicone polydimethylsiloxane (fig. 2) - consists of a chain of\naltemating silicon and oxygen atoms with two methyl\ngroups attached to each silicon heteroatom, materials\nsimilar to the atomic makeup (not structural) of inorganic materials that occur in nature (quartz, feldspars,\nand zeoli tes).\nThe chemistry required to produce long chains\n(thought necessary to develop "plastic properties"),\nbased on elements other than carbon, is not so highly\ndeveloped as that used to prepare carbon\xc2\xb7based polymers. Many of the polymerization reactions that would\nbe expected to provide high-molecular-weight inorganic\npolymers tend to produce only small cyclic molecules or\nlow-molecular-weight products. Conversely, many inorganic polymer chains, including silicones (above about\n0\n350 C), show strong tendencies to rearrange to lowmolecular-weight polymers or small ring compounds\n\n[ ,;-0 Jx\nCH 3\n\nI\n\nCH 3\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n? ? ?\n\n-O-Si-O-Si-O-Si-O-\n\nR\n\n000\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n-O-Si -O-Si -O-Si -0I\n\nI\n\nI\n\n000\nI\nI\nI\nSILICA\n\n--+-E-r--- o - J\n\n+-x\n\nR\nFigure 1.- Some inorganic polymers.\n\n234\n\nFigure 2.- Polydimethylsiloxane.\n\nupon heating, due, in the case of silicones, to cleavage of\nthe relatively strong silicon-oxygen bonds, while the\nsupposedly less stable silicon-carbon bonds remain intact\n(fig. 3).\nUp to now, inorganic polymer chemistry has generally been approached by investigating the two basic\ntypes: those consisting of chains of a single element\n(homoatom) chain (as in plastic sulfur or black phosphorus) and those having two or more dissimilar alternating elements (heteroatom) chains that utilize metals\n(such as the aluminoxanes). However, despite promising\nclaims made by early workers (ref. 4), the aluminoxanes\nhave been found to hydrolyze easily (which may not be\na lunar problem).\n\n@D SILICON\n\xc2\xa9\n\nOXYGEN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCARBON\n\no\n\nHYDROGEN\n\nFigure 4.- Aluminum metalosiloxane.\nThey reported that double-chain metalosiloxane structures containing aluminum or titanium were stable up to\n0\n590 C, while aluminosiloxanes (chains with alternating\naluminum and silicon atoms separated by oxygen atoms)\n0\nwere stable above 300 C (ref. 9). A priori, these polymers could be potentialIy useful because of the chemical\nelements available on the lunar surface.\nThese metalosiloxane polymers, even though basically\ninorganic, contain some carbon side chains. The carbon\nused to synthesize these materials remains in the final\npolymer and naturally is not available for reuse.\nMetalosiloxanes may be prepared by hydrolyzing\nmetal siloxanic compounds at room temperature. Thus,\na polyorganic silylaluminoxane may be prepared from\nnonaethylaluminoxytrisilane according to:\n\nFigure 3.- Rearrangement of silicone polymer.\n\nPRESENT TRENDS IN INORGANIC\nPOLYMER STUDIES\nMetalosiloxanes\nFew elements have been overlooked in the search for\nnew inorganic polymers. One welI-worn approach systematically replaces the silicon or oxygen atoms or both\nof the basic silicone structure by other elements of\nperiodic groups II and VI. By replacing some silicon\natoms with other metallic atoms such as aluminum or\ntitanium, materials known as metalosiloxanes have been\nprepared (fig. 4).\nThe synthesis and investigation of polymers with\nsiloxane-like structures built with Al, Ti, P, and 0 atoms\nhave been the work of Andrianov and others (refs. 5-8).\n\n2(R3 SiOhAlOH -+ (R3 SiOh AlOAl(OSiR 3)2 + H2 0\n(R3Si0 2 )AlO\n\n[~~!~~]\n\nAl( OSiR 3h\n\nThe resulting polymer contains an Al-O-Al main chain\nprotected by organic substituents (O-Si-R3) which also\nacts as a chain-stopping group. In this scheme, the aluminoxytrisilane is prepared by treating a trialkylsilanol\nwith aluminum. The material can also be obtained by\nreacting trialkyl sodium silenoxide with aluminum trichloride (possibly available from proposed lunar aluminum process).\nThese methods of preparation are not entirely satisfactory since initially they lead to the formation of\nappreciable quantities of cyclic or low-polymerized\n\n235\n\nproducts (as previously indicated in fig. 3) that can be\npolymerized further. A similar problem was observed\nwhen polymer chains containing Al-O-P linkages were\nprepared. In two recent patents, Dow workers\n(refs. 10, 11) succeeded in preparing relatively longchain aluminum-oxygen-phosphorus bond polymers by\nreacting an aluminum compound with an alkyl orthophosphonate or phosphonic and/or phosphinic acid.\nIn another study, inorganic polymers containing\nsilicon-oxygen-metal linkages were prepared over several\nyears (ref. 12) and it was found that various techniques\ncan be used to establish the silicon-oxygen-bond. However, Chamberlain (ref. 12) states that "nothing has been\nfound during this study to indicate that the Si-O-metal\nlinkage can be of great utility in the formation of chemically and thermally sta ble elastomers."\nIn addition to single-chain polymers, the ladderlike\ndouble chains (fig. 5) were synthesized by General Electric. These phenylsilsesquioxanes, or phenyl-T polymers,\nare reported (ref. 13) to have molecular weights up to\n200,000 and even up to 4X 10 6 with branching. They do\n0\nnot melt on heating, they are stable up to 400 C, and\nthey form good films by solvent deposition.\nR\nR\nR\n___ \', _ _ 0 ___ " __ 0 __ \'\n~\n\n~\n\\\n\n/\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n_ _ _ Si _ _\nI\n\nR\n\n/\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n_ _ Si __\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nR\n\n___ 0 ___\n\n~\n\n--0\n\n\\\n\xc2\xb0\n\n_ _ Si _ _ _\nI\n\nR\n\n___\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nFigure 5.- Silicone ladder polymer.\n\nCoordination Polymers\nCoordination or chelate polymers are unique to inorganic chemistry and are formed when certain electron\ndonor atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur donate\nan un shared electron pair to a metal ion that can receive\nthese electrons. The donor atoms may be part of an\norganic molecule, in which case the entire molecule is\nsaid to be coordinated to the metal.\nAttempts to crosslink chelate polymers were undertaken by a Monsanto team to develop semiorganic structural adhesives (ref. 14). However, the products obtained\nwere not homogeneous. It appears that the coordination\nprocess for preparing inorganic polymers is not fully\nunderstood. The problems include the lack of product\nsolubility, infusibility, and de polymerization of product.\n\n236\n\nMiscellaneous Polymers\nSome inorganic polymers that have been synthesized\nshow some promise. For example, polymers of titanium\noxide form strong films and are used in the optical\nindustry (ref. 15), while a mixed product containing silicon and titanium yields materials that can be coldhardened to give strong films suitable as coatings for\nceramic electrical insulators and as a water repellant.\n\nSOME PROBLEMS WITH INORGANIC\nPOLYMERS\nThe outstanding success of polymer chemists in developing organic polymers has been an inspiration to the\ninorganic polymer chemist. However, research has not\nyet revealed an entirely new inorganic polymer system\nother than silicones. The chemistry of inorganic polymers lags a half century behind the chemistry of organic\npolymers_ Since the 1960s, no recent comprehensive\ntexts on inorganic polymers have appeared\n(refs. 5, 16-18). The lag in technology is apparent not\nonly in our lack of knowledge of the polymerization\nprocess, but also regarding bonding of inorganic polymers_ For organic polymers, the general covalent Sop\nsigma bonds and sigma-pi multiple bonds are well characterized. However, the inorganic polymer systems involve\nd-orbital pi-bonding and other less familiar interactions\nof bonding electrons.\nBonding types range from wholly covalent at one\nextreme to ionic at the other. The ability of carbon to\nbond with another carbon or oxygen makes the production and study of monomers simple. These monomers\ncan then be converted to polymers by reactions that\nopen the double bonds to form polymer linking bonds,\naddition-polymerization. However, outside of the first\nraw elements, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, multiple\nbonds of the p-pi type are rare. Multiple bonds involving\np-pi-d-pi orbitals are fairly widespread, but do not react\nby addition-polymerization. As a result, inorganic monomers generally cannot be isolated to study\npolymerization.\nMolecular engineering as applied to inorganic polymer\nsystems might involve the design of molecules with optimum thermochemical bond strengths. However, one\nconsidered factor alone cannot suffice; for example,\nbond energy data may lead one to conclude that polymers based on inorganic elements should be superior to\n\norganic polymers in thermal stability. To determine thermal stability, we must ponder other kinetic considerations, for example, the silicon-oxygen bond in the silicones has a value of 110 kcal/mole, which is 75 percent\nstronger than the silicon-carbon bond (64 kcal/mole).\nYet linear polysiloxanes heated above 600 K yield lowmolecular-weight cyclic siloxanes. This indicates that the\nsilicon-carbon bonds remain intact while the siliconoxygen bonds are broken, which involves a bond\nrearrangement that occurs through a transition state,\nlowering the energy barrier relative to that required for a\ndirect thermal rupture.\nMany inorganic systems tend to polymerize through\ntwo or more units. However, most tend to form oligomers and small cyclic molecules, viz., dimers, trimers,\ntetramers, and other low-molecular-weight polymers\nrather than desired high-molecular-weight materials. Similar results were encountered in the development of silicone polymers, viz., the formation of small cyclic polymers from two to six units (fig. 3). Present technology\nhas circumvented some of the tendencies of silicones\ntoward cyclization. However, much of the product is\nstill obtained in this undesirable form. The formation of\nsmall cyclic units also presents a possible route for\nde polymerization. When higher silicone polymers are\nheated in the range of their upper temperature utility\n0\n350 C-450\xc2\xb0 C, they can depolymerize to these volatile,\ncyclic, low polymers. This phenomenon, observed occasionally in completed systems, is called reversion.\nIn retrospect, it appears that a lack of sufficient background information is the major problem. Previously,\nthere has been a strong emphasis, both commercial and\ngovernmental, for high-temperature-resistant materials,\nwith a resultant concentration on synthetic approaches\nto inorganic polymers, to the detriment of basic\nresearch. Additional studies would be most helpful in\nthe areas of inorganic bonding and polymerization reactions and probably would require a joint effort of both\ninorganic chemists (who understand the inorganic\nsyntheses) and organic polymer chemists.\n\nPOTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS\nGlassy Metals\nFor\nappears\nsuch as\nnatural\ndesired.\n\nextremely high-strength composites, there\nto be a proclivity toward more exotic materials\nwhiskers and wire reinforcements, which are\ncandidates when high structural efficiency is\nIn the same vein of new and unusual materials\n\nare the glassy metals (ref. 19). It is feasible that highstrength structures could be fabricated from these metal\nsupport materials which could be embedded in an adhesive, preferably inorganic, or a metal matrix such as\naluminum.\nNormal metallics, which are malleable, ductile, and\nopaque and are good conductors of heat and electricity,\nhave a crystalline structure in which atoms are regularly\narranged in three-dimensional repeating structures.\nGlasses, because of their covalent bonding, are strong\nand directional. It has long been known that metals can\nexhibit properties other than those of their natural state\nif they are cooled so rapidly that a nonequilibrium state\nis frozen in. The quenching rates required to produce\nglassy metals are usually several orders of magnitude\nhigher than those achievable in normal metallurgical\npractice, that is, by simply plunging the heated metal\ninto water.\nAn ingenious system for producing continuous ribbons of metallic glasses ("metaglasses") was developed at\nthe Allied Chemical Corporation. The process involves\ninjecting the hot metal in liquid form between counterrotating drums that are continuously cooled. Long\nlengths of threadlike ribbon of glassy metal, up to about\n2000 m/min, have been produced. The production cost\nis quite low because, by producing the glassy alloys\ndirectly from metal, it is possible to bypass the otherwise expensive and energy-consuming stages (such as\ncasting, rolling, and drawing) necessary when working\nwith the material in solid form.\nThe most important property of new metallic glasses\nis their unusual combination of strength and plasticity.\nCommon glass, even in the form of a thin filament,\ncannot be strained more than I percent. However, a\nmetallic glass specimen similarly shaped can withstand a\nlocal plastic sheer strength well in excess of 50 percent.\nA five-component alloy with a tensile fracture\nstrength about 3 times that of stainless steel has been\nproduced. Moreover, stainless steels cannot withstand\nstrains similar to the 50 percent observed by metallic\nglasses. Strong and hard metals are expected to be rather\nbrittle; therefore, a material that has both strength and\nductibility is an unusual advance. Another unusual\naspect of these materials is their reported magnetic properties (ref. 19).\nCold-Mold Materials\nPrimary constituents of many electrical and automotive components from 1910 to 1920 are still used in\nlow-voltage switch gear for arc chutes arc-resistant areas.\n\n237\n\nThese are the "transite" cement asbestos composites\nsimilar to some cold-mold formulations (ref. 20). A typical cold-mold composition is a cement asbestos product\nthat is volumetrically loaded in a compression mold,\npressed to shape in a punch-press-like operation, and\ncured in a water or steam-bath oven. Calcium alumino\nsilicate is used to make an asbestos-filled cold compression molded compound cured by steam. These coldmold materials are silicates, not unlike some of the\nminerals found on the Moon. It would be worthwhile to\nstudy techniques for adapting lunar silicates coupled\nwith a synthesized inorganic polymeric binder to form\ncold-mold building materials that could then be used to\nbuild space structures. In addition, the cold-formed\nmaterials could be used in sandwich multilayer construction, consisting of two outer aluminum thin face skins\nbonded to an intermediate thick layer of low-density,\ncold-formed material. The latter material could be a\nfoam type, using available oxygen as the foaming gas.\nAn Approach to Inorganic Polymers Network Type\n\nGlass technologists deal with highly crosslinked network polymers, yet inorganic polymer chemistry is\nalmost entirely concerned with linear polymers.\nResearch into processible network polymers could result\nin major advances in inorganic polymer chemistry.\nMany common inorganic substances are polymers\n(fig. 1). Each compound is composed of large numbers\nof identical structural units linked by covalent bonds,\nbut in these polymers the units are not joined in long\nchains, but instead form three-dimensional networks.\nOver the last three decades, the synthesis of inorganic\npolymers has been based on the belief that the structural\nunits must be linked together into long chain molecules\nsimilar to organic polymers.\nAlthough many novel and scientifically interesting\nstructures have been synthesized, no useful new materials other than silicones have appeared; as a result, interest in this area has greatly diminished in recent years.\nThe silicones have truly achieved fruition and embrace\nan extensive variety of polymers based on chains or networks of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms that\nmatch many of the structures found in the mineral kingdom. But, whereas the polysiloxane skeletons in natural\nminerals are crosslinked by means of metaloxy groups,\nthe corresponding backbones in silicones are isolated by\nsubstitution of organic groups at silicon sites. The siliceous minerals are crosslinked structures so involved that\nthe whole specimen of a pure mineral may be but one\n\n238\n\ncontinuous molecule, insoluble, infusible, and intractable within reasonable temperature limits. On the other\nhand, the silicone chains are lateral1y blocked by organic\nsubstituents and can merely associate with each other by\nweak van der Waals forces. Several organosilicon polymers together with their structural counterparts in the\nmineral kingdom are shown in figure 6 (ref. 16).\nIf the inorganic polymeric network structure is an\naccepted fact in natural inorganic polymers and ceramics, should this type of structure be considered as a logical extension for the synthetic inorganics? This approach\nhas been taken by N. H. Ray (ref. 21 ), who postulated\nthat the pro blem was due to the fact that inorganic polymeric structures must be linear to have the required\ncombination of properties. Strangely, this theory is\nexpounded even though the vast majority of inorganic\npolymers do not contain long-chain molecules but are\ncomposed of two- and three-dimensional networks. In\nfact, long-chain molecules are rare except among carbon\nand silicon.\nWhy ha s re search been restricted to a linear\napproach? The answer probably is processability: most\neasily processible polymers soften reversibly to viscous\nliquids and can be processed by extrusion, injection\nmolding, and vacuum forming.\nAll polymers at low temperatures are rigid solids with\ntheir molecular units bound into a three-dimensional\nstructure either by van der Waals forces or sometimes by\nhydrogen bonds (as for long-chain polymers), or by\ncovalent linkages, or sometimes by ionic forces (as for\nnetwork polymers). If a polymer is to undergo permanent deformation by viscous flow, it must move bodily.\nThis requires that the polymer be a long-chain molecule.\nFor a network polymer, a higher temperature is required\nto achieve viscous flow than for a similar chain polymer.\nHigher temperatures favor more complex reactions and\npossible degradation.\nInorganic network polymers differ from organic polymers in that the network atoms are not joined directly\n(as in graphite) but are united through intermediate connecting atoms that may be oxygen (as in the simple\ncompounds of boric acid or silica). The bonds within\nthese polymers are covalent between oxygen and boron\nor silicon.\nThe search for processible inorganic polymers need\nnot be restructured to chainlike molecules. The use of\nlinear polymers requires that one or more unreactive\nsubstituents be attached to each atom in the chain.\nThese univalent groups are either unstable to oxidation\nor hydrolysiS or are lost on heating. The silicones are\nexceptional because substituents such as methyl, when\n\nMe\n\nMe\n\nPh\n\nPh\n\n"Si./\n\n" Me\n\nMe /\n\nZn -\'0\n\n\'-.. Si/\nPh/\n\n0 ....\n\n\'-..

This process is illustrated by the chemical durability\nof ordinary glass, which is tremendously resistant to\nhydrolytic attack because of its crosslinked network\nstructure as compared to the corresponding linear polymer sodium metasilicate, which is soluble in water and\ndecomposed by acids_\nFactors to consider in design include the expected\nprocessing temperature and the crosslink density as\ndefined by P. J _ Flory (ref. 22).\nThe stability as well as desirability of network structures can be attested to by the fact that network linking\nstructures are used to overcome depolymerization of silicones by use of phenylene structural units_ The phenylene units in this semi-inorganic silicone polymer appear\nto suppress the ordinary de polymerization reaction.\nSome of these materials showed no visible decomposi0\ntion up to 500 C, but measurements indicated some\nweight loss up to 20 percent at these higher\ntemperatures.\nNetwork structures of aluminum-oxygen-phosphorus\nhave been prepared by reaction of orthophosphoric acid\nand aluminum oxide (refs. 23, 24). The products of this\nreaction from these components is a viscous fluid that\ncan be dried to an amorphous material believed to be a\nthree-dimensional network of AI-O-P chains. These phosphate materials have been used as insulating coatings and\nas binders (ref. 25).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n1. Inorganic polymer chemistry has not undergone\nthe tremendous explosion of its organic counterpart.\nThe relegated secondary status could pOSSibly be\nascribed to the synthetic approach thus far taken toward\nthe synthesis of linear inorganic polymers.\n2. Efforts to synthesize lunar inorganic polymers for\nuse as adhesives, coatings, and binders based on current\ntechnology and utilizing lunar materials would prove\nunsuccessful. However, this does not preclude future\ntechnology to alleviate this problem. What is needed is\nnot a continuing study based on the present synthetic\napproach of inorganic polymers but a different, concerted, and positively directed one, possibly using molecular engineered techniques to design inorganic network\npolymeric systems.\n\n240\n\n3. Available lunar silicate minerals are potentially\nuseful for use as cold-mold cement composites. An\neffort should be made to ascertain techniques for utilizing lunar silicates for cold-mold materials and as a core\nin multilayer composites.\n4. Filament wound structures or supports requiring\nextremely high strength could be fabricated from "glassy\nmetals." Ribbons of this very strong, hard, ductile metal\nshould prove a useful adduct for lunar composites.\n5. Another potential by-product of the lunar inorganic polymeric silicates, after subjecting them together\nwith a synthesized inorganic binder mixture to a sintering and foaming process, might be a lightweight building\nmaterial for sandwich construction, building blocks, or\nshielding.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

WILLIAMS\n\nLarge amounts of silicon and aluminum and smaller amounts of other elements will be needed to construct large\nspace structures such as solar power satellites. An analysis of transportation costs indicates that it may be much less\nexpensive to use lunar material. Although bulk lunar soil is not a suitable feedstock for extracting metals, certain minerals such as anorthite and ilmenite can be separated and concentrated. These minerals can be considered as potential ores\nof aluminum, silicon, titanium, and iron. A separation and metal extraction plant could also extract large amounts of\noxygen and perhaps hydrogen from these minerals. Anorthite containing 19 percent aluminum and 20 percent silicon\ncan be concentrated from some highland soils where it is present in amounts up to 60 percent. Ilmenite containing\n32 percent titanium and 37 percent iron can be concentrated from some mare soils where it is present in amounts up to\n10 percent. The ideal mining site would be located at the boundary between a high-titanium mare and a high-aluminum\nhighlands. Such areas may exist around the rims of some eastern maria, particularly Tranquilitatis. A location on Earth\nwith raw materials as described above would be considered an economically valuable ore deposit if conventional terrestrial resources were not available.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nG. K. O\'Neill (ref. 1) points out the potential\neconomic advantage of using non terrestrial resources,\nparticularly lunar resources, in constructing large space\nstructures in Earth orbit. This advantage accrues because\nthe gravitational well of the Moon is only about 1/22\nthat of Earth. For the very large mass of material necessary to build a large space structure such as a solar power\nstation, this difference in gravitational energy represents\na significant savings in launch costs between the Earth\nand the Moon.\nThe construction of a large solar power station will\nrequire thousands of tons of aluminum and silicon. In\naddition, a large mass of shielding is necessary to protect\nthe construction crew from exposure to cosmic rays and\nsolar flares. How much of this material can be derived\nfrom the Moon? Do economically useful materials exist\non the Moon? Can these materials be concentrated and\nprocessed to produce the material necessary for constructing large space structures? In the following\n\nsections, these questions are considered in the context of\nthe extensive lunar data base resulting from the Apollo\nprogram.\nBULK LUNAR SOIL AS A RESOURCE\nBulk lunar soil! contains as major constituents\naluminum, silicon, iron, titanium, magnesium, calcium,\nand oxygen. It has been previously proposed that lunar\nsoil could be used directly as an industrial feedstock\nfrom which all of these constituents could be extracted\nin a single plant using a variety of processes (ref. 2).\nHowever, nearly all commercial metal-extraction plants\nare designed to process a single feedstock con taining a\nsmall number of elements and to extract a single metal\nor, at most, two or three metals. The plants can then be\n\n! The term "soil" is used here to describe the fine-grained\ndebris layer which overlies much of the surface of the Moon;\nthe term "regolith" is also often used for this layer.\n\n243\n\noptimized by a single process designed specifically for\nthe feedstock and the end-product metal. For maximum\nextraction efficiency, the feedstock is usually concentrated by beneficiation processes before it enters the\nextraction plant. A plant designed to extract six or seven\nelements from bulk lunar soil would be extremely complex, it could not be optimized for a single element, and\nit would have to overcome such complex problems as\ncross reactions and blocking reactions.\nExtensive experience has shown that it is nearly\nalways far cheaper to concentrate an ore by beneficiation technique than to use the unconcentrated ore\ndirectly in the energy-intensive chemical processing\nplant. For example, energy used to concentrate iron ore\nis only about 1/10 that used in smelting and refining per\nton of processed iron (ref. 3). Without concentration,\nthe smelting and refining costs would be much greater\nand the processes themselves would need to be\nredesigned.\nBased on these considerations and drawing on the\nextensive experience of commercial metal extraction, we\nsuggest that it is more practical to limit the extraction\neffort to a small number of elements and to concentrate\nlunar materials that contain only those elements. The\nmetal-extraction plants can then be designed specifically\nfor those elements using the least complicated processes\navailable.\nIn follOWing this philosophY, we have chosen aluminum as the primary metal to be extracted from lunar\nmaterial - the mineral anorthite is the primary aluminum resource. In companion papers (refs. 4, 5), the\nmining and ore concentration operations are discussed as\nwell as the chemical processing necessary to extract\naluminum from anorthite. Silicon and oxygen are\nvaluable by-products of this extraction process. Because\naluminum and silicon may not be suitable for some\napplications (e.g., where high structural strength is\nrequired), we will also extract, on a smaller scale, iron\nand titanium from the mineral ilmenite. Again, references 4 and 5 discuss the procedures for mining and\nconcentrating the ilmenite and for chemically extracting\nits metals and oxygen. A by-product of ilmenite concentration may be recovery of solar-wind hydrogen which\ncan then be used for propulsion fuel or for life-support\nneeds when combined with oxygen.\n\nthe mineral anorthite, the aluminum-rich end memher of\nthe plagioclase series. Pure anorthite - CaAl2 Si 2 0 8 contains (by weight) 19.4 percent aluminum metal,\n20.2 percent silicon metal, 14.4 percent calcium metal,\nand 46.0 percent oxygen. Anorthite can be considered\nto be a potential aluminum ore in the sense that it is a\nnaturally occurring concentration of aluminum from\nwhich it may be economically feasible to extract the\nmetal. Bauxite, which contains about 25 percent aluminum, is currently the major terrestrial aluminum ore.\nHowever, terrestrial anorthite has been used in some\ncountries as a commercial aluminum ore (ref. 6). The\nUnited States Bureau of Mines (ref. 7) recently studied\nthe economics of extracting aluminum from anorthite\nusing a lime-soda sinter process. They concluded that the\ncost of extracting aluminum from anorthite was within a\nfactor of 2 of the cost of extracting aluminum from\nbauxite and would become even more competitive as the\ncost of bauxite increased. The Bureau of Mines is currently planning to build a pilot plant to extract aluminum from anorthite (ref. 8). Alcoa Corp., which recently\npurchased a large area of land in Wyoming estimated to\ncontain as much as 30 billion tons of recoverable\nanorthosite (ref. 9), is developing plans to recover aluminum from this source.\nIf anorthite is becoming attractive as a terrestrial\naluminum resource, it is even more attractive as a lunar\naluminum resource. The lunar crust contains a much\nhigher proportion of anorthite than does the Earth\'s\ncrust and the lunar highlands are particularly rich in\nanorthite.\nTable 1 presents Al 2 0 3 data on lunar soils sampled\nby the Apollo and Luna missions (refs. 10-12). Normative anorthite is calculated using a value of 36.6 percent\nAl 2 0 3 for pure anorthite and assuming that all the\nAl 2 0 3 in a regolith will go into anorthite. Normative\nanorthite is a good measure of the theoretical maximum\namount of anorthite that can he present. The true or\nmodal anorthite content will always be somewhat less\nbecause some aluminum will be present in solution in\npyroxenes and glasses. Table I shows clearly that the\nhighlands contain notably more normative anorthite\nthan the mare regions. It is also apparen t that the highlands show considerable variation in normative anorthite\ncontent from site to site and that the Apollo 16 site is\nthe region richest in anorthite.\n\nANORTHITE AS AN ALUMINUM RESOURCE\nANORTHITE IN APOLLO 16 ROCKS\nAluminum may be used extensively to construct a\nlarge solar power station.

The rocks display a\nconsiderable range of anorthite content. Anorthosites\nare richest in anorthite, containing more than 95 percent\nmodal plagioclase that is more than 95 percent of the\nanorthite molecule (An9 d. If we require an aluminum\nore that is more than 90 percent anorthite, then\nanorthosite rocks are an ideal ore. These rocks are represented in the Apollo collection by such rocks as 60015\n(mass, 5547 g), which is more than 98 percent plagioclase of An 96 - 97 ; 60025 (mass, I836g), which is more\nthan 98 percent plagioclase of An9 5 -9 7; 60215 (mass,\n385 g), which is more than 99 percent plagioclase of\nAn 96 - 97 ; and 65315 (mass, 300 g), which is more than\n98 percent plagioclase of An9 7 -9 8 (ref. 13). These rocks\ncontain about 35 percent A1 2 0 3 or 18 percent aluminum metal.\nUnfortunately, anorthosites are not particularly\ncommon among the Apollo 16 rocks. A survey of\n342 rock fragments 2-4 mm in size showed that only\n9 percent were anorthosites (ref. 13). A more abundan~\nrock type of a slightly lower grade is the light matrix\nbreccia_ Light matrix breccias contain about 34 percent\nA12 0 3 , or about 93 percent normative anorthite\n(ref. 14). A study of 31 1-2-mm fragments of light\nmatrix breccias showed a mean modal plagioclase content of 79 percent (ref. 15), or somewhat less than the\n\nnormative anorthite calculated from the Al 2 0 3 content.\nStudies of 2-4-mm fragments at each Apollo 16 station\nshowed a range in the total anorthosite plux light matrix\nbreccia fragments from a low of 25 percent at stations 9\nand 10 to a high of 63 percent at station 11 (ref. 14).\nThe other rock types present at the Apollo 16 site generally contain less anorthite plagioclase than either\nanorthosite or light matrix breccia. These rock types\ninclude feldspathic melt rocks with 62-84 percent\nplagioclase (ref. 16), metamorphosed breccia, and\npoikilitic rocks with 50-55 percent plagioclase (ref. 17).\nConsequently, they are lower grade potential ores of\naluminum.\n\nANORTHITE IN APOLLO 16 SOILS\nLunar soil consists mainly of fine particles formed by\nmeteorite impact communition of lunar rocks (for a\ndetailed discussion of the lunar soil or regolith, see\nrefs. 2,18). Lunar soil has the advantage of being\nalready pulverized with a mean grain size generally\nbetween 40 and 100 pm. From an economic point of\nview, this means that lunar soil is very easy to mine by\nsimple surface mining techniques and furthermore need\n\n245\n\nnot be pulverized before being fed into ore concentration devices_ This is in contrast to the much coarser rock\nor megaregolith that lies beneath the fine-grained regolith_ The megaregolith would require much more elaborate mining processes and would also require energyintensive grinding equipment. Therefore, we conclude\nthat lunar soil is the best source of anorthositic aluminum ore.\nA soil made up of meteorite-pulverized anorthosite\nrock would be the best ore. However, as shown in\ntable I, such soils have not been found and the richest\nsoils contain no more than 79 percent normative anorthite. This normative anorthite in the soil is not all\navailable for the extraction processing plant, however.\nSome of it is dissolved in impact-produced glasses\n(mainly agglutinates) and some of it is intimately intergrown with pyroxene, olivine, and ilmenite and cannot\nbe liberated without pulverizing. The amount of available anorthite that can be physically separated can be\napproximated on the basis of particle counts obtained\nfrom the 90-ISO-Mm grain size fractions of lunar soils.\nThis grain size is close to the mean grain size of immature lunar soils and may therefore be a good average of\n\nthe coarser and finer grain size populations. Table 2\npresents particle counts on 16 Apollo 16 soils from\nreferences 19 and 20. Only the anorthite-rich particles\nand agglutinates are shown. For comparison, the normative anorthite of each soil from data in references 10\nand 21 is also shown.\nColumn I in table 2 shows the percent of individual\nplagioclase grains in each soil. Based on analysis of\nplagioclase grains in the rocks, these plagioclase grains\ncan be expected to be about An9 5 -9 8\' Column 2 shows\nthe anorthosite rock fragments, which are generally\nmore than 98 percent plagioclase. Column 3 shows light\nmatrix breccia which, based on analyses of larger rock\nfragments discussed previously, can be expected to be\nabout 93 percent anorthite. Column 4 represents the\ntotal available anorthite concentrate that can be physically separated from the soils without additional grinding. The mean value for the 16 numbers in column 4 is\n43.5 percent available anorthite concentrate. The purity\nof the anorthite concentrate depends on the relative\namounts of plagioclase and anorthosite at about\n97 percent purity and light matrix breccias at about\n\nTABLE 2.- GRAIN POPULATIONS FOR SELECTED PARTICLE TYPES OF THE 90-150-Mm\nSIZE FRACTION IN SOME APOLLO 16 SOILS a\n\nSample\n\nCore\n\nSTA 1\nSTA 2\nSTA 3\nSTA4\nSTA 8\n\nSTA 11\n\n60009,455\n60009,457\n61161\n61181\n61221\n61241\n62281\n63321\n63341\n63501\n64501\n68501\n67481\n67601\n67701\n67711\n\nPlagioclase\n47.0\n76.2\n14.7\n5.3\n17.0\n12.3\n16.0\n9.6\n12.6\n10.3\n20.3\n12.3\n15.0\n14.0\n21.0\n41.0\n\nAnorthosite\n6.8\n3.8\n4.7\n4.3\n13.6\n5.0\n5.6\n11.2\n5.9\n3.0\n3.0\n1.9\n10.9\n3.6\n33\n4.6\n\nLight matrix\nbreccia\n\nTotal b\n\nNormative\nanorthite C\n\n3.8\n0.8\n13.6\n7.3\n10.0\n18.3\n11.3\n14.0\n14.9\n16.7\n6.6\n29.3\n20.3\n24.0\n34.0\n36.6\n\n57.6\n80.8\n33.0\n16.9\n40.6\n35.6\n32.9\n34.8\n33.4\n30.0\n29.9\n43.5\n45.2\n41.6\n58.3\n82_2\n\n82\n--72\n74\n\n-~-\n\naReferences 19 and 20.\nbYalues represent the total available anorthite of >90 percent purity.\ncCalculated from data in references 10 and 21.\n\n246\n\n77\n74\n73\n79\n79\n76\n75\n73\n79\n79\n78\n80\n\nAgglutinates\n12.5\n2.2\n37.0\n59.6\n6.3\n27.1\n40.0\n32_6\n40.0\n44.6\n51.6\n38.6\n23.0\n36.0\n15.6\n1.6\n\n93 percent purity. For the soils in table 2, the concentrate is more than 95 percent pure anorthite.\nThe Apollo 16 samples are the most anorthite-rich\nsoils of the Apollo missions. They contain 75 percent\nnormative anorthite. An anorthite concentrate making\nup 43.5 percent of the average soil can be recovered\nwi t hout additional grinding. This concentrate is\n95 percent pure anorthite. If soil from only station 11 is\nconsidered, a 58 percent anorthosite concentrate can be\nrecovered. This concentrate is more than 92 percent\npure anorthite. Thus it would appear feasible to obtain\nconcentrates that are more than 90 percent anorthite\nand comprise from about 40-60 percent of the soils.\nEFFECT OF SOIL MATURITY ON\nAV AlLABLE ANORTHITE\nThe amount of available anorthite must always be\nsomewhat less than the normative anorthite. However,\nfor a constant normative anorthite content, the amount\nof available anorthite depends strongly on soil maturity.\nThis relationship is shown in figure 1, where the available anorthite concentrate is plotted against the aggluti-\n\n90\n\n.\n\nw\'\n\n~\n\na:\n\n60\n\no\n\nf-\n\nz\nw\n\nU\n\nz\n\n0\n\n50\n\nu\nw\n\no\n\nf-\n\ni\n\n~ 40\n\no\n\n0\n\n0\n\nz\n\no\n\n<t\n\no\n\no o\n\nw\n\n~ 30\n\n<t\n\no\n\n...J\n\n;;:\n\n>\n<t\n\n20\n\nANORTHITE CONCENTRATION =\n-0.89 AGGLUTINATE + 69.5\n\n10\nIMMATURE\n\no\n\n10\n\n+\n20\n\nSUBMATURE\n\n+\n\nMATURE - - -\n\n30\n\nAGGLUTINATE CONTENT, % - - -\n\nFigure 1.- Relationship between available anorthite and\nmaturity of soil.\n\nnate content for the soils in table 1. Agglutinates are\nimpact-produced glassy aggregates of glass, mineral, and\nlithic grains, The agglutinate abundance has been shown\nto be a useful index of surface exposure age of soil\nmaturity (ref. 22). As agglutinate content increases,\nmore of the aluminum in a soil is incorporated into the\nagglutinates, either in the glass itself or in feldspar grains\nengulfed and buried by the agglutinate glass. This aluminum cannot be concentrated by physical mineral separation techniques, so it is not available as an ore. Equally\nimportant is the dilution effect of the agglutinates on\nthe recoverable anorthite concentrate. As shown in\nfigure 1, a mature soil has less available anorthite concentrate by a factor of 2 to 4 compared to an immature\nsoil. The soils richest in available anorthite concentrate\nare the extremely immature soils with agglutinate contents less than 3 percent. Such soils are created by\nmoderately large impact craters and are found at or near\nthe surface close to fresh large craters.\n\nDO HIGH-GRADE ANORTHITE DEPOSITS\nEXIST ON THE MOON?\nAt all Apollo and Luna sites, it is clear that ore\nbeneficiation by mineral separation techniques is necessary to provide anorthite feedstock that is more than\n90 percent pure for chemical processing. Do areas exist\nwhere the regolith is already more than 90 percent anorthite? If such areas were available as mining sites, there\nmight be no need for ore beneficiation.\nAs discussed above, at the Apollo 16 site, two rock\ntypes have greater than 90 percent normative anorthite:\nanorthosite and light matrix breccia. No large body of\nanorthosite has been found, but a 30-m-thick layer of\nlight matrix breccia is postulated to underlie the region\naround N. Ray crater (refs. 14, 15). If this layer were at\nthe surface, the overlying regolith might be expected to\ncontain 90 percent pure anorthite. However, no surface\nregolith of this grade has been identified in the\nApollo 16 area. Furthermore, no large body of anorthosite has been found at Apollo 16 or any of the other\nApollo or Luna sites.\nThe Apollo 15 and 16 orbital x-ray experiments\nmapped Al/Si ratios over the Command Service Module\nground tract for these missions. Al/Si ratios in highland\nregions ranged from 0,52 for the region west of Fecunditatis to a high of 0.71 for the farside highlands west of\nMendeleev (ref. 23). For comparison, pure anorthite has\na ratio of 0.96, the Apollo 16 site has a ratio of 0.67,\nand the most anorthite-rich surface soil, 67711, has an\n\n247\n\nAlISi ratio of 0.80. A material composed of 90 percent\nanorthite has an AlISi ratio of about 0.90. Consequently, it is clear that no region has been discovered by\norbital mapping which approaches the required concentration. Furthermore, the Apollo 16 area is among the\nmost anorthite-rich areas known, being exceeded only\nby some areas on the far side of those areas mapped\n(ref. 23).\nWe conclude that no large anorthite-rich region is\nnow known. Additional mapping by remote techniques\nwould be desirable to try to locate such areas. Earthbased telescopic spectra sensing has been used to determine iron content in lunar regolith (ref. 24). Since iron\ncontent varies inversely with anorthite content, areas\nextremely low in iron would be rich in anorthite. Additional Earth-based telescopic observations might discover\nsuch areas. Surveys from lunar orbiting spacecraft would\nbe highly desirable.\n\nILMENITE AS A RESOURCE FOR TITANIUM\nAND IRON\nAlthough rutile is more desirable, ilmenite is also\nconsidered to be a commercial ore for producing\ntitanium. Dupont Corp., for example, has used ilmenite\nores on a commercial basis and the United States Bureau\nof Mines has recently reviewed the feasibility of replacing imported rutile with domestic ilmenite as a source\nfor U.S. titanium (ref. 25). Ilmenite - FeTi0 3 - contains 31.6 percent titanium and 36.8 percent iron. In a\ncompanion paper (ref. 5), an extraction process is discussed that recovers titanium, iron, and oxygen from\nilmenite.\n\nTABLE 3.- MODAL (MICROSCOPICALLY\nIDENTIFIED) AND NORMATIVE\n(CALCULATED FROM Ti0 2 CONTENT)\nILMENITE IN MARE BASALTS FROM THE\nAPOLLO MISSIONS a\nModal ilmenite\ncontent, percent\n\nNormative ilmenite\ncontent, percent\n\n14-18\n14-24\n6-12\n7-11\n16-17\n13-22\n\n21.5\n22.4\n17.1\n21.3\n21.5\n22.8\n\nAPII Mean\n\n14.5\n\n21.1\n\n12202\n12021\n12022\n12039\n12051\n12063\n\n8-11\n5-12\n9-23\n8-10\n8-11\n8-10\n\n4.9\n6.6\n9.3\n5.7\n8.9\n9.5\n\n10\n\n7.5\n\n6\n0.5\n1.0\n1-5\n2\n\n4.4\n3.6\n3.4\n4.0\n5.1\n\n2.6\n\n4.1\n\n12-20\n13-37\n15-24\n19-23\n\n20.5\n24.7\n24.7\n24.7\n\n20.4\n\n23.7\n\nSample\n10003\n10017\n10044\n10045\n10049\n10072\n\nAP12 Mean\n15016\n15076\n15475\n15555\n15556\nAP15 Mean\n75055\n70215\n70035\n70017\nAP17 Mean\n\nLUNAR ILMENITE\nIlmenite is a constituent of most lunar rocks but\noccurs only in small amounts in highland rocks. Ilmenite\nis most abundant in mare basalts. Table 3 presents the\nnormative ilmenite identified in each of the large\nreturned mare basalts (ref. 26) and also shows the normative ilmenite calculated from the Ti0 2 content by\nassuming that all Ti0 2 is present as ilmenite. The\nApollo II and 17 basalts are clearly richest in ilmenite.\nThe chemical composition of lunar ilmenite is presented\nin table 4 (ref. 27).\n\n248\n\na Reference 26.\n\nILMENITE IN LUNAR REGOLITH\n\nAs with anorthite, we consider soil as a source for\nilmenite rather than the actual rocks. Again, regolith has\nthe advantage of being easy to mine and of being already\npulverized. The disadvantage is that some of the ilmenite\nis incorporated into glassy agglutinates and cannot be\nrecovered by mineral separation teclmiques. Additionally, some of the ilmenite is present as fine-grained\nintergrowths or rock fragments and cannot be separated\n\nfrom pyroxene and plagioclase without additional grinding, which we hope to avoid. Consequently, the amount\nof ilmenite available without additional grinding is considerably less than the normative ilmenite. Table 5 presents the modal ilmenite in the 90-150-J.Lm size fraction\nfor the Apollo 11 soil and for nine Apollo 17 mare soils\n(A. Basu, unpublished data on 10084, 1977) (ref. 28).\n\nThe normative ilmenite calculated from the Ti0 2\ncontent of the bulk soil is also given. An important point\nto note in table 5 is that the available ilmenite in the\naverage Apollo 17 mare soil is only 1/3 of the normative\nilmenite. All modal data in table 5 are for the\n90-150-J.Lm grain size fraction. How does available\nilmenite vary with grain size?

The overall trend is for more ilmenite to be\navailable at finer grain sizes. This trend is to be expected\nbecause a larger proportion of ilmenite grains are\nliberated from lithic fragments as the overall grain size\napproaches the average grain size of the mineral grains in\nthe lithic fragments. For sizes below 45 J.Lm, no data are\navailable, but more than 6 percent ilmenite grains should\nbe present if the trend continues. Consequently, the\n90-150-J.Lm abundance of 4.6 percent may be a representative average for the whole soil. It appears that\n90 percent ilmenite concentrates from mare soils is feasible. On average such concentrates would comprise about\n5 percent of the soil; possibly as much as 10 percent\ncould be recovered in favorable areas.\n\nSOIL MATURITY AND AVAILABLE ILMENITE\nAs with anorthite, the amount of available ilmenite is\ninfluenced by the maturity of the soil. As soils mature,\nthey generally become finer grained, which should have\nthe effect of liberating more mineral grains. However,\nagglutinates are also formed, which tends to reduce the\nabundance of mineral grains. For Apollo 17 mare soils,\nthe variation in the ratio of available ilmenite to normative ilmenite with agglutinate content is shown in\n\n249\n\nfigure 2. No trend is apparent in this figure and, at least\nfor the 90-150-fJm fraction, the degree of soil maturity\nappears to have little effect on the proportion of normative ilmenite available for mineral separation. This contrasts with anorthite, for which soil maturity strongly\ninfluenced the amount of available anorthite.\nUJ\n\nfZ\n\nUJ\n\n::;: .6\n..J\nUJ\n\no\n\n>\n~\n\xc2\xab\n\no\n\n~ .4\n\no\n\nz\nW\n\nfZ\n\nUJ\n\n::;:\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\no\n\no\n\n.2\n\ntions, mainly around the rims of circular maria (ref. 32).\nThis material contains 8.8 percent Ti0 2 and, in its\ncrystallized form, contains olivine, ilmenite, and other\nminerals. It has been suggested that this material might\nbe a useful titanium ore (ref. 33). However, the crystallized ilmenite is always very fine-grained and tightly\nintergrown with olivine. It is therefore not possible to\nseparate and concentrate the ilmenite unless the material\nwere ground to a grain size approaching 1 Mm, an\nextremely impractical undertaking. The bulk orange and\nblack glass would not make a good titanium ore as it\ncontains slightly less titanium than soils from ilmeniterich basalt regions (such as soil 75080) and contains only\nabout 1/6 as much titanium as ilmenite.\n\no\n\n..J\nUJ\n..J\n\nco\n\n\xc2\xab\n4. 0\n>\n\xc2\xab\n..J\n\nAGGLUTINATE CONTENT. %\n\nFigure 2.- Variation in ratio of available ilmenite to\n\nnormative ilmenite with agglutinate content.\nDO HIGH-GRADE ILMENITE RESOURCES EXIST\nON THE MOON?\nThe most ilmenite-rich mare basalt from the Apollo\nsamples contains about 25 percent ilmenite (table 3),\nand the most ilmenite-rich soil contains about 9 percent\navailable ilmenite (table 5). Is it likely that more\nilmenite-rich rocks and soils exist on the Moon? Ti0 2\ncontent can be approximated from optical spectral data\nusing Earth-based telescopic observations (ref. 29). From\nobservations made by this technique, the high titanium\nbasalts of Apollos II and 17 appear to represent maximum Ti0 2 contents for lunar materials. It is possible\nthat some mare lava flows could have undergone nearsurface fractionation and settling of ilmenite to form\nnear-surface ilmenite cumulates. However, little support\nfor this process can be found from the chemistry of the\nbasalt samples (refs. 30, 31). Most researchers favor the\ntheory that the ilmenite-rich basalts originated when a\ncumulate melted at some depth within the Moon\n(refs. 30, 31). Therefore, near-surface cumulates of\nilmenite may not exist. If they do exist, they have not\nyet been sampled nor have they been detected by\nremote-sensing techniques.\nBLACK GLASS AS AN ILMENITE RESOURCE\nThe orange glass and its partly crystallized equivalent,\nblack glass, are apparently abundant in numerous loca-\n\n250\n\nEXTRACTION OF HYDROGEN AND WATER\nDURING ILMENITE PROCESSING\nIt is well known that lunar soils contain essentially no\nwater, except possibly in permanently shadowed polar\ncold traps. However, more mature lunar soils contain\nsome hydrogen implanted from the solar wind. How\nmuch hydrogen is present, where is it located, and is it\nfeasible to extract it from the lunar soils? Data on\nhydrogen content of lunar materials are relatively sparse\nand mostly limited to bulk soil analyses. Data from\nvarious investigators vary by about a factor of 2 for the\nsame soil sample. Typical analyses by Epstein and Taylor\n(refs. 34-36) and Merlivat et al. (ref. 37) are in the\nrange 30 to 60 ppm with a maximum of 61 ppm.\nFriedman et al. (ref. 38), DesMarais et al. (ref. 39), and\nStoenner et al. (ref. 40) found generally higher values\nranging up to 90 ppm for 10084 (ref. 38), 92 ppm for\npart of the Apollo 15 core (ref. 39), and 145 ppm for\npart of the Apollo 17 core (ref. 40). Eberhardt (ref. 41)\nconsiders 70 ppm to be a typical concentration.\nWithin a soil, hydrogen concentration varies inversely\nwi th grain size. This variation results from the surface\ncorrelation of all solar-wind species; these atoms are\nimplanted and trapped near the surfaces of individual\ngrains. For hydrogen, the only published data on this\nvariation are by DesMarais et al. (ref. 39), who found an\nincrease by a factor of about 2 in going from bulk soil to\nsoil finer than 20 Mm. Data on the variation with grain\nsize of solar-wind helium are more plentiful. The behavior of hydrogen should be roughly comparable to\nhelium, and helium generally shows an increase by about\na factor of 2 in going from bulk soil to soil finer than\nabout 20 Mm (refs. 42,43). The concentration of hydrogen has been measured on individual grains as a function\n\nof distance inward from the surface. The outermost zone\nmay contain 400 to 600 ppm (refs. 44, 45).\nHydrogen content also varies with the type of particle_ Agglutinates in a single-grain-size fraction may contain more than twice the hydrogen concentration of the\nbulk-size fraction and more than 10 times the hydrogen\nconcentration of plagioclase (ref. 40). Although no data\nexist for hydrogen, the mineral ilmenite is known to\nretain helium much more readily than other minerals.\nHintenberger et al. (ref. 46) found for some Apollo 17\nsoils that, in the 35-54-pm grain size, the ilmenite grains\nwere enriched in 4 He by a factor of about 3 to 6 over\nthe bulk material in that size range. Eberhardt et al.\n(ref. 47) found that for soil 12001, the II-pm ilmenite\nconcentrate was enriched in 4 He by a factor of nearly 22\nover the bulk 4 He content of the soil. If hydrogen shows\nthe same enrichment factor as helium in ilmenite, the\nII-pm grain size fraction of ilmenite in 1200 I might be\nexpected to contain 22 times the bulk hydrogen content\nof 44 ppm (ref. 48). The fine-grained ilmenite would\nthen contain about 1000 ppm hydrogen. If the bulk soil\ncontained 100 ppm hydrogen and if the 22x enrichment\nfactor occurred, the fine-grained ilmenite would contain\nover 2000 ppm hydrogen. Whether hydrogen actually\nfollows these trends of extreme enrichment in ilmenite\nremains to be shown. Only the lighter rare gases show\nthis enrichment; actually, argon, krypton, and xenon\nshow a depletion in ilmenite compared to bulk soil.\nBecause of the enrichment of helium in ilmenite, soils\nshow a correlation between Ti0 2 content and helium\ncontent. Mare soils are up to an order of magnitude\nricher in helium than highland soils. The available hydrogen data do not show such a great difference. However,\nrelatively few mare soils have been analyzed for\nhydrogen_\nMaturity also influences hydrogen content. Immature\nsoil 62221 contains only 8 ppm hydrogen and the\nextremely immature orange glass sample 74220 contains\nonly 0.2 ppm hydrogen (ref. 36).\nIn summary, solar-wind hydrogen is present in some\nmature lunar soils in amount exceeding 70 to 100 ppm.\nThe hydrogen is not homogeneously distributed but is\nconcentrated in the finer grain sizes, by a factor of about\n2 for the grains of less than 20 pm. Hydrogen is also\nconcentrated by a factor of about 2 in agglutinates. The\nlargest concentration, however, may be in ilmenite\ngrains. For solar-wind helium, finer-grained ilmenite may\ncontain more than 20 times as much helium per gram of\nilmenite compared to a gram of bulk soil. Whether\nhydrogen follows this trend is yet to be determined. If it\ndoes follow the trend, however, the finer-grained\n\nilmenite or mature mare soils may contain as much as\n1000-2000 ppm hydrogen. Concentrates of this ilmenite could conceivably constitute a hydrogen ore. If this\nhydrogen were converted to water during the extraction\nprocess, the ilmenite concentrate would yield I to 2\npercent water. Particularly as a by-product of the concentration of ilmenite, hydrogen might be extracted\nfrom ilmenite on the Moon with little additional effort.\nIt should be emphasized however that the amount of\nhydrogen extracted from any concentrate must always\nbe less than the hydrogen present in the bulk soil from\nwhich the concentrate came. A thermodynamic analysis\nof the amount of hydrogen that could be extracted and\na discussion of the method and conditions for extraction\nare found in reference 4.\n\nSELECTION OF A MINING SITE\nFrom the previous discussions, a set of criteria can be\nconstructed for selecting the optimum lunar mining site\nfor AI, Si, Ti, Fe, and H2 ores:\n1. The site should be rich in anorthite, preferably as\nrich as the Apollo 16 site.\n2. The anorthite deposit must consist of relatively\nimmature regolith to increase the amount of available\nanorthite.\n3_ The site should also be rich in high Ti0 2 mare\nbasalt regolith.\n4. The mare basalt regolith should be relatively\nmature to increase the hydrogen content.\n5. The site must be suitable for the location of a\nlunar mass driver to transport the ore to space (ref. I).\n6_ The site must be flat enough to allow easy surface\nmining.\nThe requirement for an area rich in both anorthite\nand ilmenite can only be met at a boundary between a\nmare region and a highland. region_ In addition, the mare\nregion must contain a high Ti0 2 basalt. These requirements are met at many places on the front side of the\nMoon, namely, around the margins of the high Ti0 2\neastern maria. The requirement that the highland area be\nvery rich in anorthite rather than, for example, KREEP\nor highland basalt, places an additional restriction on the\nsite. The Descartes highlands area near the Apollo 16 site\nmeets this requirement as determined from the returned\nsamples and from the relatively high AI/Si and low Fe of\nthe orbital x-ray experiment (refs_ 23,49). Whether this\nhigh AI region continues northward to Mare Tranquilitatis is not clear from the orbital data. Mare Tranquilitatis is relatively high in its southwestern quadrant near\n\n251\n\nthe lobe of highlands extending north from the Apollo\n16 region. Consequently, this margin of Tranquilitatis\nmight be an excellent site.\nHowever, mass-driver siting seems to require a location farther east, preferably at long. 33\xc2\xb040\' E and lat.\n10 44\' N in southeastern Tranquilitatis (ref. 50). This\nregion appears to be lower in Ti0 2 and the closest\nhighland region appears somewhat lower in Al/Si ratio\n(ref. 23). More detailed remote data are needed to\nchoose the optimum site for high Ti0 2 and high Al/Si.\nThe requirement that the highland site be relatively\nimmature is an important one, but one which can fairly\neasily be met by location near a relatively large fresh\ncrater that has ejected a large quantity of fresh, immature soil. Mature mare regions should also be easy to\nlocate as they predominate in areas away from fresh\ncraters.\nMost mare sites should be flat enough for easy surface\nmining. A problem might arise with the highland area\nbecause highlands at the boundary of mare basins often\nhave a mountain front. However, experience from\nApollos 15 and 17 has shown that highland soils are\neasily accessible in talus slopes or debris aprons at the\nbase of highland mountains. At the Apollo 17 site,\nrelatively pure mare soil (80 percent mare, 20 percent\nhighland material) was located at station 5 within 7 km\nof highland soil (92 percent highland, 8 percent mare\nmaterial) at station 2 (ref. 51). Even over the 4 km\nbetween station 6 and the 1M, the character of the soil\nchanged from 70 percent highland to 70 percent mare.\nAt the Apollo 15 site, mare soil at station 9 was about\n85 percent mare material although it was only 4 km\nfrom the highland front (ref. 52). It would appear that a\nseparation of about 5 km between a highland and mare\nmining pit would be sufficient to provide a reasonably\nclean separation of soil types. Even less distance might\nbe appropriate for properly chosen sites. A debris apron,\ntypically about 300 m wide, usually separates highland\nfronts from mare areas (ref. 53). Mining pits separated\nby only 300 m might be sufficient if located on either\nside of a debris apron.\n\nAnorthite contains 19.4 percent aluminum and\n20.2 percent silicon. It has been used commercially as an\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\naluminum ore and will be used more and more in the\nfuture as the supply of bauxite declines. For titanium\nand iron, lunar ilmenite would be an excellent ore.\nIlmenite contains 31.6 percent titanium and 36.8 percent iron. Chemical processing of both anorthite and\nilmenite can produce abundant oxygen as a by-product.\nMineral separation techniques should be used on the\nlunar surface to concentrate the anorthite and ilmenite\nores before shipping. Mining and ore beneficiation are\ngreatly assisted by the fine-grained nature of the lunar\nsoil, which eliminates the need for blasting, crushing,\nand grinding. An anorthite concentration mill located at\nthe Apollo 16 site could recover 40 to 60 percen t of the\nsoil as a 90 percent pure anorthite concentrate. An\nilmenite concentration mill on a high Ti0 2 mare soil\ncould concentrate 5-10 percent of the soils as 90 percent pure ilmenite concentrate. These numbers are based\non the available soil data. However, more accurate figures are necessary and can be determined only if lunar\nsoil is analyzed specifically for extractable anorthite and\nilmenite content.\nThe ilmenite concentrate may be rich in solar-windderived hydrogen, perhaps containing as much as\n1000-2000 ppm hydrogen in the fine-grained ilmenite.\nThis quantity of hydrogen is equivalent to nearly\n1- 2 percent water. This water could be extracted from\nthe ilmenite concentrate with little additional effort\nbeyond that needed to mine and concentrate the ilmenite.\nHowever, actual analyses of hydrogen in ilmenite are\nnecessary before the hydrogen concentration in ilmenite\ncan be known with any certainty. In any case, hydrogen\nextraction would probably only be worthwhile as a\nby-product of ilmenite concentration processes.\nThe ideal mining site must be near both an immature\nhighland area and a more mature Ti0 2 mare area. Such\nsites exist around the margins of some of the eastern\nmaria including Tranquilitatis. The southeastern margin\nof Tranquilitatis is also ideally suited for a mass-driver\nlocation. Additional chemical and soil maturity data are\nneeded to determine whether acceptable mass-driver\nsites and acceptable geological sites coincide.\n\nWe have discussed reasons why bulk lunar soil is not a\nsuitable raw material for chemically extracting metals.\nOn the basis of considerable terrestrial experience, it is\nmuch more desirable to concentrate minerals containing\nthe desired metals and then to use extraction techniques\nspecifically designed for these minerals. A suitable lunar\nore would be anorthi te feldspar for aluminum and silicon.\n\nAfter candidate sites are located by Earth-based and\nlunar-orbiter remote techniques, detailed geologic prospecting, mapping, surveying, and sample analysis would\nbe necessary before a site could be certified for mining\noperations. Such a site, if transported to Earth, would\nhave such abundant and easily accessible anorthite and\nilmenite as to make it a valuable terrestrial ore body, if\nconventional terrestrial ores did not exist.\n\n252\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

CHANG\n\nThe suitability of existing terrestrial extractive metallurgical processes for the production of AI, Ti, Fe, Mg, and O2\nfrom non terrestrial resources is examined from both thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. Carbochlorination of\nlunar anorthite concentrate in conjunction with Alcoa electrolysis process for AI; carbochlorination of lunar ilmenite\nconcentrate followed by Ca reduction of Ti0 2; and subsequent reduction of Fe203 by H2 for Ti and Fe, respectively,\nare suggested. Silicothermic reduction of olivine concentrate was found to be attractive for the extraction of Mg\nbecause of the technological knowhow of the process. Aluminothermic reduction of olivine is the other possible alternative for the production of magnesium.\nThe large quantities of carbon monoxide generated in the metal extraction processes can be used to recover carbon\nand oxygen by a combination of the following methods: (1) simple disproportionation of CO, (2) methanation of CO\nand electrolysis of H 20, and (3) solid-state electrolysis of gas mixtures containing CO, CO 2, and H20. The research\nneeded for the adoption of Earth-based extraction processes for lunar and asteroidal minerals is outlined.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe success of the space activity depends directly on\nthe successful processing of non terrestrial resources to\nobtain essential structural and life-support materials. A\nvariety of structural materials is needed for the construction of solar power stations, mass-driver units, solar flare\nshelter and for the inside structures of the habitat.\nAluminum was considered to be one of the essential\nmetals needed for the construction of such space facilities (ref. 1). It was suggested that an extensive workshop\nmust be provided as a fabrication facility so that many\nof the heavy components of a rolling mill, extrusion\npresses, casting beds and other equipment may be made\nat the space settlement rather than brought from Earth\n(ref. 1). It is, therefore, imperative that metals such as\niron, titanium, and silicon, be available for steel manufacture. Finally, oxygen is one of the most essential\nelements needed for the life support.\nThe chemical and physical nature of lunar soils has\nbeen described by Levinson and Taylor (ref. 2). The\n\nlunar highlands consist mainly of anorthosite (ref. 3).\nLunar rocks and fines also contain high titanium content\nand most of the titanium is present as ilmenite (FeTi0 3 )\n(ref. 4). Based on the analysis of some meteoroids it is\nexpected that asteroids may contain considerable\namounts of olivine (T. Bunch, NASA-Ames Research\nCenter, private communication). Chemical compositions\nof these non terrestrial resources reveal that aluminum,\niron, titanium, and magnesium can be recovered in\nspace. The possibility of manufacturing these elements\nin space has also been considered in previous studies on\nthe utilization of non terrestrial resources (refs. 1,4,5).\nIn this study, the suitability of existing terrestrial\nextractive metallurgical processes for the production of\nAI, Ti, Fe, Mg, and O 2 in space is examined from both\nthe thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. However,\nthe processes for extracting these elements from the\nnonterrestrial sources must be different from those conventionally used on Earth for the following reasons:\n1. It is estimated that recovery of these elements is\nmore economical in space than transporting them from\n\n257\n\nEarth. The conventional hydrometallurgical operations\nare therefore not feasible because of the lack of water\nand hence suitable pyrometallurgical operations must be\noptimized.\n2. Because of the load constraints of the space\nshuttle, only elements such as hydrogen, carbon, and\nchlorine, are suitable reductants. These reductants are to\nbe carried from Earth.\n3. There is a definite need for a process whereby the\nreactant carried from Earth can be recycled indefinitely.\nThus, the reduction processes must be carefully considered to avoid irrecoverable losses of reductants.\n4. The reduction processes must be specially suited\nfor the conditions of space, viz., low gravity and high\nvacuum.\n5. Since the source of oxygen is mainly the oxide\nminerals, the effluent gases from the reduction processes\nmust be reprocessed to yield oxygen.\nThese constraints pose enormous problems and\ndemand new processes. This paper evaluates suitable\nbeneficiation processes for lunar and asteroidal minerals\nand indicates research efforts that must be extended to\nascertain the feasibility of these processes. Some of them\nare based on thermodynamic evaluations and appear to\nbe feasible, but no relevant industrial information exists.\nSuch processes should be further investigated experimentally to identify optimal process conditions.\n\nALUMINUM\nThe main source of aluminum in the lunar soil is the\nplagioclase concentrate which contains mainly anorthite,\n\n(Ca,Na)(Al,Si)40s\' On Earth, aluminum is not normally\nproduced from anorthite, although such resources are\nbeing seriously considered because of depleted supplies\nof bauxite ores (ref. 6). The chemical composition of\nanorthite is compared with the usual clays and bauxite\nresources of Earth in table 1. The major difference\nbetween anorthite and other minerals is the calcium content, which might prove to be a considerable problem in\nthe extraction of aluminum.\nThe only processes known on Earth for the beneficiation of anorthite is the soda-lime sintering process\n(developed by the Bureau of Mines), which was tested\nboth in the laboratory and by pilot plant operation\n(ref. 7). The general reaction of this process is represented by:\n\nThe reaction products are treated to obtain alumina.\nIn the lime-soda sintering process, it is evident from\nreaction (1) that large amounts of calcium and sodium\ncarbonates are required. Each mole of anorthite consumes 3 moles of CaC0 3 and 1 mole of Na2 C0 3 , which\nare not readily available on the Moon. Additionally,\nlarge amounts of water are needed for various leaching\noperations and water is very limited on the Moon. All\nthese constraints lead one to search for other suitable\nprocesses. The major processes considered are: carbothermic reduction, carbo chlorination , aluminum monohalide process, and electrolysis. Out of these processes,\ncarbochlorination, followed by the electrolysis of chlorides, was considered most attractive since a great deal is\nknown about this process.\n\nTABLE 1.- COMPARISON OF THE CHEMICAL\nCOMPOSITION OF LUNAR ANORTHITE WITH\nTHE TERRESTRIAL ALUMINUM MINERALS\nPercent dry basis\n\nBauxite\n\nClay\n\nAnorthite\n\nAl 20 3\nSi0 2\nFe203\nTi0 2\nCaO\nMgO\nIgnition loss\n\n258\n\nAlumina\n\n100\n\n-----\n\n14.28\n\n40\n44\n0.5\n0.7-2.5\n0.1\n--14\n\n34\n45\n1\n\n-----\n\n40-58\n9-25\n0.5-3\n\'V2\n0.1\n\n-----\n\n---\n\n--19\nI\n\n---\n\nCarbothermic Reduction of Anorthite\nIn carbothermic reduction, the oxide reacts with\ncarbon to produce metal and carbon monoxide:\nMxO/s) + yC(s)\n\n-*\n\nxM(s,Q) + yCO(g)\n\n(2)\n\nSince all constituent oxides of anorthite are highly\nstable, the reduction must be carried out at elevated\ntemperatures (\'\\..2500 K). At these temperatures, other\ncompounds such as SiC, Al4 C3 , Al4 0 4 C in the condensed phase, and Al 2 0, SiO, Al, Si, and Ca in the\ngaseous phase are invariably present. Because of these\nphases, a reaction of the type (2) is very complicated.\nMost recently, Grjotheim et al. (ref. 8) explained the\ncomplications in the carbothermic reduction of alumina\nand reviewed the aluminum-producing reactions. Metal\nlosses in the carbo thermic reduction do occur because of\nthe substantial vapor pressures of Al2 and Al. Gitlesen\net al. (ref. 9) calculated the partial pressures of Al, Al2 0\nand CO in the \'system Al4 0 4 C - Al4 C 3 - Al, where\nAl4 0 4 C and Al4 C 3 are the condensed phases formed\nduring the carbothermic reduction of alumina. It is fairly\nconclusive from their calculations that the aluminum\nand aluminum suboxide pressures are so high below\n1900\xc2\xb0 C that liquid aluminum cannot be formed at\nnormal operating pressures. Any liquid aluminum added\nto the system would be consumed by the reactions\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nAl(Q)-*Al(g)\n\n(4)\n\nto maintain the equilibrium compositions of the gas\nphase. Above 2100\xc2\xb0 C, the solid aluminum carbide\ndecomposes to aluminum and carbon. Also, carbonmonoxide partial pressure increases rapidly with respect\nto Al and Al 2 0, favoring the formation of aluminum.\nHowever, metal losses through Al(g) and Al 2 0(g) would\nstill be Significant unless special conditions are\nmaintained.\nStroup (ref. 10) explained the special conaitions for\nthe carbothermic smelting of aluminum. In this process,\nthe presence of a layer of molten aluminum saturated\nwith carbide floating on a layer of molten oxycarbide\nand oxide in the electric furnace was taken to advantage.\nBoth layers were electrically conductive, so the process\nwas operated in a submerged arc or resistance furnace.\nBoth the electrode and the raw charge pass through the\nmetallic aluminum layer in operation. In the present\nprocess, the aluminum layer is allowed to saturate with\n\nAl 4 C3 at 2000\xc2\xb0 C, which reduces the activity of aluminum and maintains the temperature high enough to\nhinder back-reaction with carbon monoxide. The reaction between alumina and aluminum is also minimized\nwhen alumina is converted to oxycarbide.\nStriplin and Kelley (ref. 11) studied the feasibility of\nforming aluminum-silicon alloys by electrothermal\nreduction of clays and coke. To produce this alloy, the\nclay composition should contain at least 30 percent\nSi0 2 . Although this process appears to be feasible provided the conditions are carefully chosen, several unexplained problems make the process unattractive:\n1. The extent of reduction of Ca, Mg, Ti, Mn, and Cr\nand their distribution in the slag and vapor phase is not\nwell established.\n2. The formation of carbides, oxycarbides, and suboxides complicates the reaction mechanism which\nrequires detailed study of the proper temperature and\nproportion of carbon-to-silicate ratio in the feedstocks.\n3. Pilot plant operation with alumina and silica\nshowed that the formation of carbides and oxycarbides\nmade it impossible to obtain a melt of Al and Si below\n2000\xc2\xb0 C. Even at 2300\xc2\xb0 C, the extent of metal losses\ndue to promotion of products into vapor phase is not\nwell established. The metal losses are promoted when\nthe process operates under high vacuum conditions existing in space.\n4. Anorthite contains Significant amounts of CaO,\nwhich further complicates the process. At 2000\xc2\xb0 C, CaO\nis also reduced, yielding a Ca-Al-Si alloy that must be\nfurther purified.\n5. Separation of CaO before the reduction process\nincreases the amount of capital investment and requires\nlarge amounts of materials not readily available on the\nlunar surface.\n6. Despite several years of research, no plant for\nproducing aluminum through carbothermic reduction\nexists.\nCarbo chlorination Methods\nIn view of the potential problems anticipated in the\ncarbothermic reduction of anorthite to produce aluminum, a low-temperature carbo chlorination with Ch followed by an electrolysis of the aluminum chloride produced appears to be more promising. A carbochlorination method using AlCI 3 is considered first.\nHigh-temperature carbochlorination with A1Cl 3 - A\nvariation of carbochlorination recently tested by Peacy\nand Grimshaw (ref. 12) was based on an original proposal by Mitterbiller and Fruhwein (ref. 13). In this\n\n259\n\nprocess, aluminum monochloride produced by\ntemperature reduction of bauxite with carbon and\nis shock-quenched to obtain AI containing\namounts of Si. The process can be essentially\nsented by:\n\nhighAlCI 3\nsmall\nrepre-\n\nAl203(S) + 3C(s)\n\nfree. Anorthite contains significant amounts of CaO, and\nany chlorination process for anorthite must consider the\nformation of highly stable CaCl 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 Fortunately, CaCI2 is\na very useful by-product of the carbo chlorination of\nanorthite. The various steps in the chlorination process\nare illustrated in figure 1.\nThe following reaction equilibria are to be considered\nin the thermodynamic analysis of the process.\n\n+ AlCh(g) T=1800\xc2\xb0 ~ 3AlCI(g)\n\n+ 3CO(g) Shock Quenc~ 2Al(Q) + AlCI 3 (g)\n\n(5)\nCaO(s) + C(s) + CI 2 (g) --+ CaCI 2(s) + CO(g)\n\nIf this process is used to extract Al from anorthite, many\nproblems will arise. Because of the reduced activity of\nalumina, much higher temperatures are needed to obtain\na reasonable yield of AlCl. This high-temperature process\nwould pose severe problems such as corrosion of the\nreactor material compared to a low-temperature carbochlorination process. Further, substantial amounts of\nSiCl 2 and CaCI 2 will be present in the vapor phase from\nanalogous reactions with Si0 2 and CaO in anorthite,\nresulting in an aluminum alloy that contains significant\namounts of Ca and Si with some minor impurities. An\nadditional purification step would then be required to\nrecover the individual metals.\nThis process has been demonstrated only on a bench\nscale with bauxite. The only other attempt with a nonbauxite alumina ore is a single test (conducted at U.S.\nBureau of Mines, ref. 14) in which carbochlorination of\nclay with AlCl 3 in the presence of lampblack and sugar\ndid not yield any metal at 1300\xc2\xb0 C. This process is\nuntested and also is not economically feasible compared\nto a low-temperature carbochlorination process followed\nby low-temperature electrolysis. Hence, the other alternative - low-temperature carbochlorination with Cl 2 is a better method for extracting aluminum from lunar\nanorthite.\nLow-temperature carbochlorination with el 2 - This\nmethod is essentially the same as the first step in Toth\'s\nprocess (ref. 7) in which AlCl 3 obtained from a lowtemperature carbochlorination of ores that contain\nalumina is reduced to aluminum by manganese at about\n0\n250 C. The Mn content in AI obtained usually exceeds\nthe theoretical value by 1 weight percent. Because of\nvarious technical complications (i.e., a very slow reduction of AICI 3 by Mn), AlCI 3 obtained from the first step\nof Toth\'s process will be used to extract Al by an\nelectrolysis route.\nPrevious studies of low-temperature carbochlorination of ores that contain alumina have been mainly\nconfined to bauxite and clays which are essentially CaO-\n\n260\n\n(7)\n\nSi0 2(s) + 2C(s) + 2CI 2 (g) --+ SiCI 4 (g) + 2CO(g)\n\n(8)\n\nThe net reaction is\n\n+ 2AlCh(g) + 2SiCI 4 (g) + 8CO(g)\n\n(9)\n\nIn the original Toth process of CaO-free ores containing alumina, the optimum temperature for carbochlorination was 975\xc2\xb0 C. However, for chlorination of anorthite, a lower operating temperature is required because\nCael 2 is liqUid above 772\xc2\xb0 C, which introduces problems\nin operation. An optimum temperature between\n0\n675\xc2\xb0 _770 C is preferable for anorthite chlorination.\nIn addition to the above mentioned equilibria, chlorination reactions involving some of the alkali, alkaline\nearth oxides, as well as FeO, MgO, and Ti0 2 , must be\nconsidered since most of these are present as impurities\nin lunar plagioclase concentrate. Most of the resulting\nchlorides are volatile and are condensed along with\nAlCl 3 . Thermodynamic calculations reveal that the\nvapor phase contains very little CaCl 2 or complexes of\nAlCl 3-CaCI 2 -FeCl 3 . Since the recovery of Si0 2 is\nimportant for many glass-formation processes, the\nchlorination of Si0 2 in anorthite can be prevented if the\nrequired amounts of SiCl 4 are used along with C1 2 .\nAlCl 3 in the gas phase can be recovered by successive\ncondensations to remove other volatile chlorides. Initially, FeCl 3 in the gas phase is condensed to a solid by\ncooling to about 225\xc2\xb0 C in a heat exchanger/condenser.\nAlCl 3 and chlorides other than SiCI 4 and TiCI 4 are\n0\ncondensed in a second stage at 90 C, while the latter are\n0\nrecovered in a subsequent stage at -30 C. The reactor\nresidue is heated above 775\xc2\xb0 C to liqUify CaCl 2 , which\ncan be separated from Si0 2 -rich residue by centrifuging.\nThe estimated composition of the residue should contain\nat least 75-82 weight percent Si0 2 and no more than\n\n800\xc2\xb0C\nCARBOCHLORINATION\n\nREACTOR\nRESIDUE\n\nCaCI 2\n\n+\n\nCENTRIFUGE\n\nSi0 2\n\nEFFLUENT\nVAPORS\nM = Fe,Na,K,Ti,Ge,Mg\n\nHYDROLYSIS\n\nCONDENSER - 1\n\nCONDENSER - 2\nTITANIUM)\n( EXTRACTION\n\nCONDENSER - 3\n\nALUMINUM\nELECTROLYSIS\n\nOXYGEN\nAND\n( CARBON\nRECOVERY\n\nFigure 1.- Aluminum processing.\n5-10 weight percent Al 2 0 3 and 10-15 weight percent\nCaO.

The chlorine and water can be recycled further.\nPertinent thermodynamic calculations along with\nheat and mass balance are given in the appendix (see\ntables 4-6).\nAlcoa Electrolysis Process\nThe electrowinning of aluminum from the electrolysis\nof AICl 3 dissolved in a mixture of alkali and/or alkaline\nearth chlorides was attempted as early as 1854. These\nvarious early attempts are summarized in reference 8.\nThe most successful process to date is the one devel\xc2\xb7\noped by Alcoa (at a cost of $25 million and 15 years of\nresearch). Since most of the problems encountered in\nelectrolysis were solved by Alcoa and a plant producing\n15,000 tons/yr is in operation, we selected this method\nfor producing Al from the AlCl 3 obtained by carbo-\n\nchlorination. The Alcoa process has some distinct advantages over the classical Hall-Heroult process for electrowinning of aluminum: the working temperatures are\nsubstantially lower, relatively high current densities are\nused, carbon anodes are not consumed, and a much\nsmaller plant area is required. The electrical energy\nconsumed is claimed to be only 70 percent of that used\nin the Hall-Heroult process, mainly because of the higher\nelectrical conductivity of the electrolyte and the small\ninterpolar distance of Alcoa cells.\nBecause the technical details of the process are proprietary, only a brief outline and a discussion are given\nhere. Figure 2 shows typical electrolyte cells. The feed\nconsists of 3-10 weight percent of purified AlCl 3 along\nwith the required amounts of alkali and alkaline earth\nchlorides. Electrolysis is performed under inert conditions in a sealed cell consisting of 20 to 30 bipolar\ncarbon electrodes stacked vertically at an interpolar\ndistance of 1 cm. Each bipolar electrode behaves as a\ncathode on its top surface and as an anode on its bottom\nsurface. During normal operation, all electrodes remain\n\n261\n\nELECTROL YTE FEED\n(AICI 3 + ALKALI AND\n\nLID WITH\nREFRACTORY\n\nto the cell; chlorine gas is also recycled into the carbochlorination step.\n\n"""" """ \'""I~Aii:\n\nTITANIUM AND IRON\nGRAPHITE\nELECTRODES\nELECTROL YTE\n\nSTEEL MANTLE\nWITH REFRACTORY\nLINING\n\nGRAPHITE\nCOMPARTMENT\n\nFigure 2.- Alcoa\'s bipolar cell for electrolysis of aluminum trich10 n\xc2\xb7de.\nimmersed in the electrolyte at an operating temperature\nof 700\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb1 30\xc2\xb0 C. A current density of 0.8-2.3 A/cm 2\nand a single-cell voltage of 2.7 V are typical operating\nconditions in the Alcoa process. Two typical compositions of the electrolyte (in weight percent) are:\nAlCI3(5), NaCI(53), liCI(40), MgCI 2(0.5), KCI(0.5), and\nCaCI 2 (1); and AICI 3 (5 \xc2\xb1 2), NaCI(53), and LiCI(42 \xc2\xb1 2).\nThe aluminum chloride concentration must be carefully controlled to ensure trouble-free operation. The\nAlCI 3 concentration must be above a certain limit to\nprevent the discharge of alkali ions, which are detrimental to the electrodes as they form inter chelation\ncompounds with graphite. An upper limit is set by the\nhigh pressure of AlCI 3. Also, the oxide content of the\nelectrolyte must be as low as possible to prevent significant anode consumption with an attendant formation of\nan insoluble oxychloride sludge. An operating life of\nnearly 3 years is claimed for the electrodes when the\noxide content of the electrolyte remains below 0.03\nweight percent. The energy consumption of the cell is\n9 kWhr/kg of aluminum produced.\nA useful feature of the cell is that the chlorine gener\xc2\xb7\nated at the anode sweeps the aluminum away from the\ncathodes and enhances the coalescence of Al droplets.\nThe pumping effect of the chlorine bubbles maintains a\ncontinuous electrolytic How across the cell, thus preventing the formation of Al pools on the electrodes.\nChlorine collects at the top of the cell while molten\naluminum falls countercurrently to the chlorine gas into\na graphite compartment at the bottom of the cell.\nliquid aluminum is passed through a filter to separate it\nfrom any excess electrolyte. The electrolyte is recycled\n\n262\n\nThe main source of titanium and iron for nonterrestrial extraction is the ilmenite concentrate obtained\nfrom the lunar soil. The lunar ilmenite is of fairly high\ngrade when compared to the terrestrial deposits. The\nchemical composition of lunar ilmenite concentrate is\nshown in table 2.\nTitanium is commercially produced on Earth from\nilmenite by a chlorination process and was described in\nan earlier study (ref. 5). In this process, iron is separated\nfrom Ti0 2 by leaching with sulfuric acid after reducing\nilmenite with coke or hydrogen at high temperatures.\nThe residue (Ti0 2 ) is chlorinated in the presence of\ncarbon to form TiCI 4 which is further reduced by magnesium to yield titanium sponge. This process eliminates\nleaching at the final stages so that the dissolved hydrogen and oxygen content is minimum in the titanium.\nThis helps to sustain the mechanical properties of\ntitanium as well as to get pigment grade titania. While\nthis is the most accepted process on Earth, and can be\nadapted for space operation; other alternatives are listed\nbelow.\nNaOH Treatment\nThe ilmenite can be treated with molten NaOH\naccording to the process patented by Hoekje and\nKearley (ref. 15). During tlus treatment, Ti0 2 is preferentially dissolved in NaOH leaving Fe203 which is\ninsoluble in NaOH. The undissolved Fe203 is separated\nand the liqUid is leached with hot water. This process also\nremoves impurities such as aluminum and chromium.\nSince the leaching process uses water instead of acid, the\nprocess is easier to perform. However, this process has\nbeen tested only on a bench scale.\nCarbochlorination Process\nThe other promising process appears to be the one\npatented by Daubenspeck and Schmidt (ref. i6) (fig. 3).\nThe ilmenite is treated with CO at 650\xc2\xb0-1000\xc2\xb0 C to\nreduce Fe(lII) to Fe(II) (this step may be unnecessary\nfor lunar material). In this process the ilmenite is added\nat a rate of 5 kg/hr to a tube (4 in. in diameter X 48 in.\nlong) containing 90-95 weight percent Ti0 2 and just\nenough carbon to reduce FeO. It is then chlorinated at\n\nTABLE 2.- BULK COMPOSITION OF PLAGIOCLASE,\nILMENITE AND OLIVINE CONCENTRATES a\nSpecies\nSiOz\nTi0 2\nAl 2 0 3\nCr203\nFeO\nMnO\nMgO\nCaO\nNa20\nK 20\nP2 0 S\nS\nEnrichment factor\nAl 2 0 3\n\nPlagioclase b\n\n44.90\n0.05\n33.67\n>0.01\n1.09\n>0.01\n1.35\n18.59\n0.45\n0.16\n0.03\n>0.01\n1.96\n\nI1menite b\n\nOlivine c\n\n3.78\n48.10\n1.07\n0.49\n43.28\n0.03\n1.29\n1.07\n0.04\n>0.01\n>0.01\n>0.02\n\n36\n\nEnrichment factor\nTi0 2 3.7\nFeO\n2.2\n\n--2\n0.3\n9\n0.2\n23\n2\n1\n0.2\n\n---\n\n-------\n\naNinety percent mineral and 10 percent residue.\nbLunar source.\nc Asteroidal Source (based on the analysis of Meteoroids (T.

A\nprocess reported by Chertien and Wyss (ref. 17) was\nchosen. In this process, a mixture of powders of calcium\nmetal and Ti0 2 is pelletized at 71,000 Ib/in.2 and\nheated for 2 h at 925\xc2\xb0-950\xc2\xb0 C. The titanium produced\ncan be recovered by preferentially leaching CaO with a\nweak-acid wash solution. The main advantages of the\nprocess are that the leaching is minimal and all reagents\ncan be recovered and recycled. The calcium metal can be\nobtained by processing calcium chloride, a by-product in\nthe extraction of aluminum from anorthite.\nThe production rate of titanium can be enhanced by\nscaling up the process to handle 69,000 tons of ilmenite\nper year. Alternatively, several reaction tubes can be\nemployed to process the reqUired ilmenite. Some TiO z\nhave to be brought to the space manufacturing facility\n\n(SMF) for the initial charge of the first tube. Ti0 2\nproduced subsequently can be used to charge the other\ntubes.\nThe processes described in this report involve minimum leaching operations but at th(l final stages so that\nsome hydrogen and oxygen might dissolve in titanium.\nTitanium thus produced either by this method or by the\nprocess described earlier (ref. 5) must be melted to\nobtain an ingot. Because of the high vacuum and very\nlow oxygen activity in space, it is expected that the dissolved oxygen and hydrogen will be partly removed\nduring vacuum melting operation.\nIron extraction- The ferric chloride obtained from\nthe carbo chlorination of ilmenite can be treated further\nto extract iron. It can be reduced to metallic iron\ndirectly by H2 at about 700\xc2\xb0 C. Hydrogen chloride is a\nuseful by-product and can be used in the chlorination\nprocess. Alternatively, FeCl 3 can be oxidized in a fluidized bed at 300\xc2\xb0-350\xc2\xb0 C to produce Fe2 0 3 , which can\nbe reduced with either Cor H2 below 1000\xc2\xb0 C to obtain\nlow-carbon steel or iron.

From a technical\nstandpoint, calcium carbide is less attractive compared\nto ferrosilicon, but it was used as a reducing agent for\nmagnesite before and during World War II.\nThe overall reaction for the process is\n\nSilicothermic Reduction of Olivine\nThe production of magnesium through silicothermic\nreduction of dolamite is well known (refs. 20-23). The\nreducing agent used in industry is ferrosilicon containing\nusually about 75 to 80 percent Si. The basic reaction of\nthis process is represented as:\n2MgO(s) + 2CaO(s) + SiCs)\n\n-+\n\n2Mg(g) + Ca2Si04(s)\n\n(13)\n(18)\nfor a mixing ratio of 1:2 (olivine:calcium carbide). Reaction (I3) does not represent a valid equilibrium scheme.\nReaction (13) is obtained by combining reactions (14)\nand (15):\n\nHowever, Ca-Si alloy is expected to form as an intermediate when the reaction temperature is above\n0\n1000 C:\n\n+ 2CaO(s) + SiC(s) + 3C(s) (14)\n\n(19)\n\n265\n\nwhere n indicates the silicon-to-calcium ratio in the\nliquid alloy. The equilibrium reaction for the production\nof magnesium is then:\n2CaO(s) + 2MgO(s) + Si(sol) --> 2Mg(g) + Ca2Si04(s)\n(20)\nFor processing asteroidal resources, the raw material is\nolivine rather than dolomite. The corresponding reactions for olivine are:\n\n(21 )\n4CaO(s) + (2n + I )Si(s)\n\n-->\n\n2CaSi(so I) + Ca2 Si0 4(s)\n(22)\n\n2CaO(s) + 2MgO(s) + Si(sol) --> Ca2 Si04 + 2Mg(g)\n\nnon terrestrial mineral agglomerates such as lunar raw\nmaterials. Further, to maintain the life process in space,\nhumans require an atmosphere of acceptable composition and pressure. The desired composition of the atmosphere given below (ref. 24) is said to be the minimum\npressure needed to meet the criteria for atmospheric\nsafety:\n\nRelative humidity = 50 \xc2\xb1 10 percent\n\nkPa 22.7 26.6\n\n1.0\n\n<0.4\n\nThe total atmospheric pressure is maintained at about\nhalf that at sea level on Earth (50.8 kPa).\nIn the following sections, various methods of recovering O 2 and C from the by-products of metal extraction\nprocesses are examined.\n\n(23)\nThe main reaction that yields magnesium (23) is the\nsame as for dolomite (20) and hence the magnesium\npressure for the two processes is identical. The reduction\nof olivine by silicon in the presence of calcium oxide has\nbeen studied by Grjotheim et al. (ref. 19). They found\nthat the absolute magnitudes of the calculated and\nobserved pressures are in fair agreement. They also\nfound that the slope of log PM vs I/T was in rather\ngood agreement between the ixperimental data for\nolivine reduction and the various data for dolomite\nreduction. The establishment of magnesium pressure\nover the mixture of olivine, calcium oxide, and silicon\nwas observed to be sluggish. The reaction rate was adequate when calcium fluoride of 5 weight percent was\nadded as a catalyst.\nSince the Pidgeon process has been used successfully\nto produce magnesium from dolomite commercially, the\nsame technology could be profitably used for olivine\nreduction. Calcium oxide and silicon necessary for this\nprocess can be obtained from the by-products of anorthite processing.\n\nOXYGEN\nThe most basic requirement for a space habitat is the\navailability of oxygen, which must be extracted from the\n\n266\n\nExtraction of Oxygen, Water, and\nMethane From CO\n\nAs a by-product of the aforementioned metal extraction processes, large amounts of carbon monoxide are\ngenerated which can be profitably used to recover solid\ncarbon and to generate O 2 , H2 0, and CH 4 . For such\nrecovery, three interdependent processes are envisioned\n(as illustrated in fig. 5). One simple method is to generate CO 2 and deposit carbon by the disproportionation\nof CO on a suitable catalyst that uses the well-known\nBoudouard reaction:\n2CO(g) catalyst CO 2 (g) + C(s)\n\n(24)\n\nMolecular oxygen and carbohydrates can be further\nobtained by photosynthesizing CO 2 , On the other hand,\nCO can be reduced with H2 in a catalytic reactor to\nproduce water and methane:\nCO(g) + 3H2(g)\n\n--> C~(g)\n\n+ H2 0(g)\n\n(25)\n\nThis reaction has been used widely for many years in the\npetrochemical industry. Water is removed in a condenser\nand electrolyzed in one of several industrial electrolysis\ncells to obtain hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can be\nrecycled to the catalytic reactor for further reduction of\nCO.\n\nCARBON MONOXIDE\nFROM\n\nCATALYST\n\nH2\nSOOoC\n\n700\xc2\xb0C\nDISSOCIATION\nOF\nCARBON MONOXIDE\n\nMETHANATION\n\nC\n\nQ\n2SoC\n\nELECTROL YSIS\n\nFigure 5.- Oxygen and carbon recovery processes.\n\nRosenberg et al. (ref. 25) investigated the methanation kinetics in the presence of nickel-on-kieselgator\n0\ncatalyst at 250 C. They outlined reaction conditions\nthat resulted in the quantitative conversion of CO to\nmethane and water in a single pass without the formation of by-product carbon or CO. Certain factors must\nbe considered carefully: catalytic poisoning by the\nimpurities in the gas feed, flow rate of gases, catalyst bed\ndepth, and precisely controlling the temperature of the\nbed. Rosenberg et al. (ref. 25) reported complete conversion of CO to methane even with a space velocity of\n2000 hr- 1 at a H2 /CO ratio of 4. At a lower H2 /CO\nratio, bed pressures up to 6 atm were required for higher\nconversion rates.\nRecently, Cabrera et al. (ref. 26) compared the\ncatalytic properties of cobalt, nickel, and lunar dust for\nthe CO methanation reaction. For similar specific\nsurface areas, the reaction rate constant was found to\ndecrease in the order Co > Ni > lunar dust. Although Co\nand Ni catalyzed the reaction at temperatures near\n0\n200 C, detectable quantities of methane appeared only\n0\nabove 440 C with the lunar dust as the catalyst. At\n0\ntemperatures near 800 C, the catalytic activity of lunar\ndust is increased significantly. In view of the abundance\nand low cost of lunar dust compared to Co and Ni,\nfurther research should be conducted to correlate the\ncatalytic activity with different lunar soil samples of\nvarying grain sizes.\n\nAnother convenient method of recovering oxygen\nfrom the by-product gases is by solid-state electrolysis.\nThis technique essentially involves the high-temperature\nelectrolysis of the gas mixture consisting of CO, CO 2 ,\nand H 20 using a solid oxide electrolyte permeable to\noxygen ions only. Since this recent technique has considerable potential, it is discussed in detail in the next\nsection.\nSolid-State Electrolysis for the Recovery\nof Oxygen and Carbon\nOxygen can be generated at the anode by the electrolysis of a gas mixture containing CO 2 , CO, and H2 0\nusing a solid electrolyte cell of that type:\nPt, O2 / Solid electrolyte / CO 2 , CO, H 20, Pt\n\n(0 2-)\nThe less stable gas species (e.g., CO 2) will decompose\nfirst, followed by the more stable ones (e.g., CO). The\nhalf-cell reactions can be written:\nAt cathode:\n2C0 2 (g) + 4e - -7 2CO(g) + 20 2-\n\n(26)\n\n2H 2 0(g) + 4e - -7 2H2 (g) + 20 2-\n\n(27)\n\n267\n\nAt anode:\n(28)\nThe net reactions are\n(29)\n2H2 O(g) ~ 2H2 (g) + O2 (g)\n\n(30)\n\nThe solid electrolyte can be a well-established one\nsuch as calcia-stabilized zirconia or yttria-stabilized\nthoria. On the other hand, Ce0 2 doped with 5 percent\ny 203 might be a better choice since recent investigations (refs. 27, 28) have shown that it has a much higher\nconductivity than CaO-stabilized zirconia and remains\npurely an ionic conductor down to 10-13 atm oxygen\n0\npotential at 600 C.\nCarbon and hydrogen can be removed if electrolysis is\nperformed to remove all oxygen from the gas mixture.\nHowever, to completely remove oxygen, the oxygen\npotential at the cathode must be reduced below the\nelectrolyte conduction domain of Ce02 materials. It is\nproposed, therefore, to carry out the electrolysis in two\nsteps: first, the oxygen potential in the gases is reduced\nby decomposing the less stable oxygen-bearing species\nusing Ce02 -based electrolytes; in the second stage of\nelectrolysis, Y203"stabilized tho ria can be used to completely remove the oxygen.\nThe following characteristics of the solid electrolyte\nsystem for oxygen reclamation are important in any\nsolid-state electrolysis study:\n1. Stable gas-tight high-temperature seals\n2. Electrolyte stability in terms of vaporization and\ndegradation\n3. Stable long-life electrodes\n4. Compatibility between the coefficients of thermal\nexpansion of the electrolyte and the cell structure\nThe only oxygen reclamation investigation based on\nthe solid-state electrolysis is that of Weissbart et al.\n(ref. 29). They used calcia-stabilized zirconia as the electrolyte and conducted long-term electrolysis experiments with CO 2 and CO 2 -H 2 0 gas mixtures. Thev found\nthat small amounts of H 2 0 are needed to catalyze the\nreaction. For instance, the yield of oxygen with pure\nCO 2 is only one-fourth that obtained with CO 2 and a\nsmall amount of water vapor. Typically, the oxygen\nyield was 1 mole/min/W. Based on the results of\nextended tests, the following conservative design param-\n\n268\n\neters for a one-man operated prototype CO 2 electrolyzer\nwere suggested by Weissbart et al. (ref. 29):\n0\n1. Operating temperature of 850 C\n2. Current density of 100 mA/cm 2\n3. O 2 Faradaic efficiency = 100 percent\n4. Electrolysis power, 250 W\n5. Electrolysis power efficiency, 50 percent\n6. Conversion of CO 2 to CO and O2 of 35 percent\nper pass\n0\n\nAt 850 C their cell ran for 200 hr at 100 percent\ncurrent efficiency without apparent degradation. They\nfound that the glass-ceramic sealing was effective up to\n1000 hr of electrolysis. Precious-metal seals and porous\nPt electrodes appear to be reliable for runs of 2000 hr\nand probably much longer. Further experiments are\nneeded to resolve some of the anticipated problems in\nlarge-scale, solid-state electrolysis for oxygen recovery.\nFor instance, the cell operation at high temperatures\nposes certain problems concerning materials, sealants,\ncell structure, power to maintain high temperatures,\nincreased cell weight, and volume required for\n"insulation. "\nOn the other hand, the oxygen recovery by solid-state\nelectrolysis offers substantial advantages over conventional methods:\n1. Since the electrolyte permits the transfer of\noxygen ions only, the separation of oxygen from the gas\nmixture in a sealed cell is excellent.\n2. The problem of gas-liquid phase separation at zero\ngravity is not encountered since there are no liquids in\nthe electrolyte cell.\n3. Unlike the fused salt electrolysis, only a few construction materials are needed for the cell since solid\nelectrolyte is noncorrosive.\n4. The continuous electrolysis of CO 2 or H 2 0 or a\nmixture of CO, CO 2 , and H 2 0 is possible.\n\nASSESSMENT OF FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDS\nSome of the processes described here have not been\ntested thoroughly, even for terrestrial applications on a\nlaboratory scale. A few processes, such as AI electrolysis\nand methanation of CO, have proved to be commercially\nfeasible and plants based on such processes are in operation. Although a partial list of problems likely to be\nencountered in various processes is given under respective sections, general and specific research areas are outlined here.\n\nMetal Extraction Processes\nBefore any experimental work is undertaken, the\nvarious experimental factors, phase relations, and volatilization reactions must be identified. Once these\nfactors are identified, a systematic method of representing the various reaction equilibria must be devised.\nStability field diagrams in which the chemical potentials\nof the system components are represented as a function\nof temperature or of a specific species offer one such\napproach. Hence, as a first step in the experimental\nprocess, it is proposed to construct such diagrams for\nvarious tenary systems (Mj-MrX j and M-X j -X 2) and\nquaternary systems (M j -M2 -Xj -X2\' M-Xj -X2 -X 3 ) of\ninterest in the extraction processes of AI, Mg, Si, and Fe;\nM denotes a metal (Ca, Fe, AI, Si, or Mg) while X\ndenotes a nonmetal (0 2 , C1 2 , or C). Some of the experimental data needed to construct such diagrams are\nalready available in the literature.\n\nIn view of the importance of rate processes in the\nextraction of metals, the next logical step would be to\nundertake a systematic and thorough investigation of\nkinetics and mass-transfer situations. By performing\nbatch segregation tests, the effects of various factors\nsuch as reagent additions, particle size, and temperature\ncan be investigated. Based on these results for a single\nprocess, a kinetic model can be set up which, in turn,\ncan be used to predict process yields from limited data\ngathered by different processes.\n\nCarbochlorination of anorthite- There have been\nfew, if any, studies done, either thermodynamic or\nkinetic, on the low-temperature carbochlorination of\nanorthite. The first step in the investigation is the\nsynthesis of plagioclase concentrate (90 percent anorthite + 10 percent rock) with its bulk composition\nclosely identical to that of lunar material. Experimental\ninvestigations must be performed with the following\nobjectives in mind:\n1. Analyze vapor phase, preferably by a mass spectrometer modified for high-pressure sampling\n2. Analyze the reactor residue\n3. Determine the extent of deviation from thermodynamically calculated values for both condensed and\nvapor phases\n4. Adjust feed rates of various reactants to the fluid\nbed reactor to selectively remove AI 2 0 3 as AlCl 3\n5. Separate CaCl 2 and Si0 2 from the reactor residue\nand determine the composition of the residue\n6. Evaluate chemical engineering aspects of the\nprocess as related to lunar or extraterrestrial conditions.\n\n7. Reinforce initial bench scale investigations with\npilot plant studies\nAlcoa electrolysis process- Since most of the technical aspects of this process for extracting Al from AlCl 3\nhave already been worked out, further studies should be\ndevoted to finding an electrolyte composition more\nsuited to lunar conditions. The aluminum chloride\nobtained from the carbochlorination of lunar anorthite\nwill contain some alkali and alkaline earth chlorides.\nInstead of purifying the chlorides, an electrolyte composition compatible with these chlorides must be\nobtained. This new composition might be obtained by\nonly slightly modifying the electrolyte composition\nrecommended in the Alcoa process for terrestrial\nconditions.\nExtraction of Ti and Fefrom ilmenite- The processes\nfor extracting Ti and Fe from ilmenite have already been\nworked out on a laboratory scale. The processes must be\ntested on a commercial scale. As in the Al extraction\nprocess, the first step in extracting Ti and Fe is the\nchlorination of ilmenite in a fluidized bed reactor. The\nkinetic model set up for anorthite chlorination might be\nuseful in evaluating the process yields based on the\nlimited data concerning ilmenite chlorination.\n\nExtraction of Mg from Olivine- Of all the pyrometallurgical processes for the extraction of magnesium from\nolivine, silicothermic reduction is the well-investigated\nprocess. However, the role of calcium silicide as an\nintermediate in the overall reduction process needs to be\nstudied.\nThe following areas need to be investigated for choosing the other alternatives:\n1. Kinetics of olivine reduction with aluminum as the\nreducing agents. and\n2. The optimum ratios of reducing agent (AI) needed\nfor the reduction processes.\n\nOxygen and Carbon Recovery\nThe kinetics, engineering design, and feasibility of\ncontinuous recovery of carbon and oxygen, vital for\nextraterrestrial activities, have not been thoroughly\ninvestigated. Some potential areas of research in the two\nproposed processes for the reclamation of oxygen and\ncarbon from by-products of metal extraction processes\nare outlined here.\nMethalZation of CO- Further investigations are\nneeded to clarify the chemical role of lunar and interstellar dust as a catalyst for the methanation reaction of\nCO and H2 to produce CH 4 and H20. If the catalytic\n\n269\n\nactivity is proportional to the radiation damage sustained by lunar dust in addition to their higher surface\narea, fine-grained particles might be a better catalyst\nbecause they are exposed to radiation longer than\ncoarse-grained particles. The necessary submicron-sized\nlunar dust, because of its persistent internal polarization,\ncan be effectively separated by electrostatic purification.\nStrong research efforts should be undertaken to verify\nthe grain-size correlation of the catalytic effect, which, if\nproven correct, would lead to a very inexpensive way of\ncatalyzing methanation without resorting to currently\nused industrial catalysts such as cobalt and nickel.\nSolid-state electrolysis- This recent area of research\nhas potential for the recovery of oxygen and carbon\nfrom the effluent gases of metal extraction processes. In\nsolid-state electrolysis, the power requirements become\nexcessive as the operating temperature is lowered\nbecause of higher cell resistance at lower temperatures.\nHence, it is desirable that the cell temperatures be\ndecreased as far as possible, consistent with high Faradiac efficiency. In view of the recent synthesis of solid\nelectrolytes, such as Y z 0 3 doped CeOz with high ionic\nconductivities compared to the conventional ZrOz -CaO\nand ThO z -Y 20 3 electrolytes, it might be possible to\noperate the cells at lower temperatures with considerable\nsavings in energy. Hence, the experiments should be\nconducted with the following objectives in mind:\n1. To test the feasibility of CeOZ-YZ03 electrolyte\n\n2. To establish the optimum conditions for long life\nof the cells\n3. To improve the existing design of the metalceramic seals\n4. To select an optimum temperature - the lowest\ntemperature of cell operation consistent with acceptable\nIR loss in the electrolyte\nAPPENDIX\nSUGGESTED EXTRACTION PROCESSES\nFrom the several possible methods for extracting\nmetals and oxygen from the lunar and asteroidal\nresources, the following are considered best suited for\nnon terrestrial conditions:\n1. Carbochlorination of lunar plagioclase concentrate\nin conjunction with Alcoa electrolysis for Al\n2. Carbo chlorination of lunar ilmenite concentrate\nfollowed by Ca reduction of TiO z and subsequent reduction of FeZ03 by Hz for Ti and Fe, respectively\n3. Silicothermic reduction of asteroidal olivine concentrate for Mg\n4. Methanation of\\ CO and electrolysis of Hz 0 and/or\nsolid-state electrolysis of gas mixture containing CO,\nCOz and Hz 0 for oxygen\nThe principal reactions of interest in the metal and\noxygen

BUNCH\n\nThe beneficiation of lunar plagioclase and ilmenite ores to feedstock grade permits a rapid growth of the space\nmanufacturing economy by maximizing the production rate of metals and oxygen. A beneficiation scheme based on\nelectrostatic and magnetic separation is preferred over conventional schemes but such a scheme cannot be completely\nmodeled because beneficiation processes are empirical and because some properties of lunar minerals have not been\nmeasured. To meet anticipated shipping and processing needs, the peak lunar mining rate will exceed 1000 tons/hr by\nthe fifth year of operation. Such capabilities will be best obtained by automated mining vehicles and conveyor systems\nrather than trucks. It may be possible to extract about 40 kg of volatiles (60 percent H 2 0) by thermally processing the\nless than 20-}1 ilmenite concentrate extracted from 130 tons of ilmenite ore. A thermodynamic analysis of an extraction\nprocess is presented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIt has been proposed that lunar rocks and soils will be\nuseful raw materials for manufacturing materials for use\nin space construction (refs. 1,2). Many factors relating\nto the use of lunar materials as industrial feedstocks have\nbeen discussed previously (ref. 3). However, a major\ntopic of considerable practical importance to the utilization of lunar resources, the beneficiation of ores, has not\nbeen fully discussed in view of recent work on lunar\nsamples and in lunar science. This paper examines the\npotentials for the mining and beneficiation of lunar\nmaterials.\nThe beneficiation of ores to an industrial feedstock\ngrade is always desirable before such material is chemically processed, both because it reduces the size and\nenergy requirements of chemical processes and because\nit can significantly reduce the complexity of such processes while increasing their efficiency (ref. 4). Also,\nsince beneficiation usually requires only differentiation\nof components by physical properties, it is a relatively\nlow-energy process (refs. 5, 6).\nThe physical and chemical properties of lunar ores are\ndescribed elsewhere (refs. 3, 6). (The use of the word\n\n"ore" here is somewhat unusual, but we are assuming\nthat the economic benefit of the use of these materials is\nestablished.) The availability of lunar materials rich in\nplagioclase and ilmenite (ref. 6); the proposal of chemical processing schemes to obtain Al and Si0 2 from\nplagioclase and Fe and Ti from ilmenite (ref. 4); the\ndesire to produce CaO-MgO-AI2 0 3 -Si0 2 fiberglasses\n(ref. 7); and the recognition that fine-grained \xc2\xab20}1)\nilmenite is a potential source of lunar H2 (ref. 6) have\ndetermined the type and scale of mining and beneficiation schemes discussed here.\nTwo very simple mass-flow economics by which lunar\nmaterials might be converted into useful products are\nillustrated in figure 1. Mining is, of course, confined to\nthe lunar surface. Shipping carries material from the\nlunar surface to a manufacturing facility located in\nspace; shipping includes packaging materials for transport, launch from the lunar surface, and transport within\nspace from the Moon to the manufacturing facility.\nLaunching and transportation are assumed to use "mass\ndrivers" (refs. 1,2). At the manufacturing facility\n(labeled "process" in fig. 1), the ores are converted to\nuseful products. Neither the shipping nor the processing\nportions of these models is considered in any detail here.\n\n275\n\nPROCESSING G5\n\nB.\n\nFigure 1.- Mass flow for two mining and beneficiation,\nshipping, and processing schemes.\nAlthough the locations of mining and manufacturing\nare defined, beneficiation can occur either after (fig. 1,\nroute A) or before (fig. 1, route B) shipping. Beneficiation on the lunar surface is developed here because, for\na given shipping capacity, the removal of waste by beneficiation before shipping allows a larger mass of products\nto be produced. A consequence of this choice is that the\nmining output is larger than it would be for the model A\nin figure 1. Note that if the manufacturing were also on\nthe lunar surface, an even larger mass of products could\nbe shipped from the lunar surface. Here we consider\nonly model B in figure 1, where mining and beneficiation occur on the lunar surface; the results of other\nstudies (refs. 1-4, 6, 8, 9) are used to set the scales of\nthe lunar surface operations.\n\nBENEFICIATION SCHEMES\nFortunately, lunar soils are generally fine-grained\n\xc2\xab100/1; ref. 3) and crushing is therefore unnecessary.\nHowever, disaggregation and size separation are preliminary steps in the beneficiation process. Subsequent beneficiation might involve the separation of a nonmagnetic\nphase from a weakly magnetic waste for plagioclase ore\nor of materials with different electrical properties and\ndensities for ilmenite ores. We have proposed two\nschemes for doing this, one based on established avail\xc2\xb7\nable technology and the other on extrapolations of exist\xc2\xb7\ning phenomena and technology.\nPresent Technology\nThe flow sheet for present technology is shown in\nfigure 2(a). The ilmenite ore is a mature mare soil\n(ref. 6). The ore is first passed through a coarse sieve to\n\n276\n\nremove fragments larger than 1 cm. After sieving, the\nmaterial must pass through an airlock; it is then treated\nwith an air cyclone that disaggregates the soil and\nremoves the <20-/1 particles. (No commercial,\nindustrial-scale cyclones of this type exist.) These particles are separated into ilmenite and tailings by magnetic separators. The coarse fraction is separated for\ndensity on a pneumatic table and the dense fraction is\nmagnetically refined to yield the ilmenite concentrate.\nAll tailings and products must be transferred out\nthrough an airlock for shipment. Plagioclase ore is\ntreated in much the same way, except that magnetic\nrefinement is used to concentrate the plagioclase. In a\npractical system, several parallel systems will be needed\nto handle the volume of ore. The cyclones that both\ndisaggregate and separate according to size require large\nvolumes of high-velocity gas (ref. 5). The use of air as a\nfluid medium for the beneficiation of the ores requires\nthat large amounts of material be transferred from the\nvacuum of the lunar surface into an atmosphere and\nthen returned to that vacuum. To do this with large\namounts of materials at high rates (up to 1000 tons/hr,\nsee below) without significant losses of air (if only as\nadsorbed gases) is a formidable technical problem.\nAdvanced Technology\nAn advanced technology system was designed and\nanalyzed (fig. 2(b )). The ilmenite ore is coarse screened.\nThe ore is sized and disaggregated by an electrostatic\ndevice in which the soil is charged and then separated for\nsize based on its trajectory in an electrostatic field under\nlunar gravity. Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of this\ndevice; rand p are ranges for lunar materials (ref. 10),\nand E, for terrestrial minerals (ref. 5).\nThe device was scaled using lunar gravity and the\nprinciples of electrostatics. The primary velocity for\nparticles is supplied by falling in the lunar gravity field;\nthe charging electrodes must supply an electrostatic field\ngradient in the direction of flow. Separation is achieved\nby diverting the particle flow into a tangential stream\nand nullifying a portion of the gravity force with electrostatic force. The resulting particle trajectories should\npermit separation based on particle size. The feed will\nvary in all three fundamental parameters (r, p, and E)\nand thus 100 percent efficiency of separation is not\npossible. Only rand p are well known for the various\nmaterials that make up lunar soil; E is known only for\nbulk soils and rocks. The range of r is much greater than\nfor p and thus, if E is not the controlling parameter, size\nseparation should be possible. The discharge surfaces are\n\n-- --\n\n,,\nCOARSE SCREEN\n\n"\n\nILMENITE ORE\n\nPLAGIOCLASE ORE\n\n--------------lr----------\n\nT\nA\nI\nL\nI\n\nN\nG\nS\n\no\n\nSHIELDING\nMASS\nAIR LOCK\n\n(a) Present technology, using fluid media for disaggregation and separation.

We note that, in principle,\nthe ilmenite could be beneficiated by a two-step magnetic separation process with fields of different intensities. However, since usual magnetic separators are\nsomewhat heavier and consume more power than electrostatic systems (refs. 5, 13-15), we prefer electrostatic\nsystems.\nPlagioclase ore is treated similarly except the electrostatic refinement is unnecessary and the <20-/1 fraction\nis collected for use as mass-driver reaction mass and as\nshielding at the space manufacturing facility (SMF).\n\nResults of Beneficiation\n>20011\n\nEo::cr 2 ;\n\nFcx: pr3\nDC\n\n[f-prl\n\nF\n\nGRAVITY FORCE\n\nE\n\nELECTROSTATIC FORCE\n\np\n\n:.

An interesting alternative might be to use elec\xc2\xb7\ntrostatic levitation of the particles as a "frictionless"\ntransport mechanism throughout the rest of the system.\n(A laboratory device that uses electrostatic fields to\nseparate lunar soils according to size is discussed in\nref. 11. However, to our knowledge, such a device does\nnot now exist as commercial equipment.) After sizing,\nparticles >20011 and those <20/1 are first subjected to\nmagnetic separation in a weak field to remove about\n50 percent of agglutinitic glasses and, finally, ilmenite is\nelectrostatically refined from the remaining silicates in\nsepara te streams.\nAlthough electrostatic separation of a light fraction\nfrom a dark fraction has been demonstrated on lunar\nmaterial (ref. 12), no quantitative data exist for lunar\nminerals from which to derive operating parameters and\n\n278\n\nThis advanced system is analyzed in figures 4 and 5 in\nterms of fractions, efficiencies, and ore grade. Table 1\npresents the parameters used in the analysis. The fractions (j) and grade (g) are based on lunar soil data\n(refs. 3,6), the efficiencies (e) are estimates. In the\nabsence of specific data on the electrostatic and magnetic properties of lunar minerals, efficiencies based on\nthese properties can only be estimated. We also note that\nterrestrial beneficiation operations are also largely\nempirical (ref. 5). It is obvious that primary data should\nbe collected and bench tests conducted.\n\nI\n\n--- ---\n\nI\n\nI ---I\n\nMa- ORE\nMINED\n\n...\n\n- ---\n\nCOARSE SIEVE\n\nI\n\nTAILINGS\n\n[f" e,l\n\nI\n\n>200 J1\n<20 J1\n\nI\n\nELECTROSTATIC\nSIZING\n\nPYROXENE,\nOLIVINE,\nGLASS\n\n[fe\' eel\n\nl\n\nMAGNETIC\nSEPARATION\n\nI\n\nJ\n\n[f m , eml\n\nI\n\nrna - PLAG.\nCONC.\n\nI\n\nTa\n\nFRACTIONS IN ORIGINAL ORE\nMASS EFFICIENCY OF SEPARATION\nGRADE OF ORIGINAL ORE\nM\n\nMASS OF ORE MINED\n\nT\n\nMASS OF TAILINGS\n\nrn\n\nMASS OF CONCENTRATE\n\nE\n\nOVERALL MASS EFFICIENCY\n\nSUBSCRIPT:\na PLAGIOCLASE\n\nFigure 4.- Development of parametric approach to\nplagioclase are beneficiation.\n\nTAILINGS\n>1 em\n\n[f"\n\n\',1\n>2001\'\n\nELECTROSTATIC SIZING\n\n1 - - - - - - + - - - - - - - - - - + 1 MAGNETIC\n1-----+1 MAGNETIC\n\'---"""T"""----\' [f~, .~ I\n\nPYROXENE,\n\n1--_ _- \\ O~~V~~,\n\nTable 2 presents the calculated chemical composition\nof the ilmenite and plagioclase concentrates.

The products\nof such processing are shown in table 3. It appears that\nthe production of fiberglass will require about 4 percent\nof the total capacity; therefore, the data in table 3 are\nnOllllaliLcu to this factor. The residue, a rather complex\nsilicate-oxide mixture, is assumed to be an adequate\nshielding material.\nFurthermore, 20 percent of the shipped mass is al1ocated for use as reaction mass to move mass-driver tugs\nfrom L2 to the SMF. We assume that the mass for the\n\n280\n\n100\n\n_100L-____L -____L -____L -____~____~__~1\n\no\n\n2\n3\n4\nTIME, yr, SMF frame of reference\n\n6\n\nFigure 7.- Distribution of mass type shipped to SMF as\na function of time in the SMF frame of reference.\n(See text for assumptions.)\n\nthat excess mass accumulates at the SMF during years 2\nthrough 5 (the values are yearly mass budgets that are\nnot cumulative) and that the 20-percent reaction mass is\nsimply an assumption that has not been tested or optimized. After year 5, waste will simply accumulate at the\nSMF unless further growth occurs; this may present\nproblems if a static future is assumed.\nThe production from chemical processing is summarized in figure 8. The percentages are normalized to\nexclude residues. These production data and the beneficiation analysis (figs. 4 and 5) can be back-calculated\nto scale the mining operations (fig. 9) and waste/useful\nmass data (fig. 6). Finally, the data are presented in\nnumerical form in table 4. The mining rate was derived\nfrom a 3700 hr/yr work time, which is based on the\nlunar day/night cycle, a loss of one shift at the beginning\nfor startup and one at the end of each day for shutdown,\nand 7.5-hr production for each 8-hr shift.!\n\n4\n\n3\n\nW\n\n0:\n\na\n\nw\n\nto-\n\nZ\nw\n\n::;:\n....J\n\n~2\n::;:\no\nw\nz\n\ni\n\n300\nWT\n\n%\n\nr PRODUCTS (l03n\n\nO2\nSi\n\n36.4\n24.0\n17.2\n9.7\n8.4\n4.3\n\n344\n220\n158\n89\n77\n39\n\nAI\n\n;; 200\n\nFe\nTi\nGI\n\nRAW\nMASS\n\n0\n\nvi\n\no\n\ntoU\n\nTIME, yr, lunar reference frame\n\n=>\n\n0\n\na\n\n0:\n\nFigure 9.- Mined lunar mass divided into ilmenite and\nplagioclase ores as a function of time.\n\n""\nLL\n\n0\n\n\'"\n\xc2\xab\n\'"\n\n::;: 100\n\nQuantification of Mining/Beneficiation System\nOXYGEN\n\no\n\n234\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTIME, yr, SMF frame of reference\n\nFigure 8.- Mass of products produced at SMF by chemical processing using thermodynamic efficiencies to\nscale the outputs.

A potentially more severe\nproblem, however, is the recovery of equipment from the extreme\ncold of the lunar night.\n\nThe mining rates can now be converted to a rough\nmap of the area to be mined (fig.

Table 5 gives\nestimates of the size, mass, and power of the processing\nmodules. These values are based on data from references 5 and 12-14, but, in the absence of experimental\ndata on beneficiation of lunar ores, they should be\nconsidered no more than order-of-magnitude estimates.\nMasses could be Significantly less on the Moon. The\nmasses of conveyors, supports, and module housing were\nnot considered in table 5. Each module in table 5 is sized\nto accept over 220 tons/hr; they should meet the maximum mass flow need with about 10 percent excess\ncapacity. The module in table 5B handles a <20-11\nilmenite fraction; only one should be needed even at\n\n281\n\nTABLE 4.- LUNAR MINING AND BENEFlCIATIONS SCENARIO, YEARS 1 THROUGH 6\n\nYear\n(lunar\nframe)\n\nShipped mass, 10 3 tons\n(reaction mass;\nshielding; processing)\n\nMined mass, 103 tons\n(ilmenite ore;\nplagioclase ore)\n\nBeneficiation, 10 3 tons\n(ilm. cone., plag. cone.,\nfines) (tailings)\n\nMining rate ,a\ntons/hr\n\n1\n\n30\n(6; 24; 0)\n\n30\n(0; 0)\n\n---\n\n8\n\n2\n\n150\n(30; 25; 95)\n\n717\n(464; 253)\n\n3\n\n300\n(60; 0; 240)\n\n1800\n(1160; 640)\n\n4\n\n450\n(90; 0; 360)\n\n2726\n(1769; 957)\n\n5 and 6\n\n600\n(120; 0; 480)\n\n3656\n(2349; 1277)\n\n717\n(16; 79; 55)\n(567)\n1800\n(40; 200; 60)\n(1500)\n2726\n(61;299;90)\n(2346)\n3656\n(81; 399; 120)\n(3056)\n\nMined area,b\n104 M2\n(plagioclase;\nilmenite)\n\n0.1\n( ---)\n\n194\n\n24\n(8; 16)\n\n486\n\n60\n(21; 39)\n\n737\n\n91\n(31;59)\n\n988\n\n122\n(43;79)\n-\n\na Assumed 3700 hr; plagioclase ore/total = 0.35; rounded to nearest ton.\nb Assumed 2 m depth; p = 1.5 g/cm 3 ; rounded.\n\nMARE PIT\nILMENITE\nORE\n\nSHIFTABLE\nCONVEYOR\n\n4\n3\n\nO\n\nBENEFICIATION\nPLANT\n\n2\n3\n\nPERMANENT\nCONVEYORS\n\n5\n\nPLAG/ILM\nORE\nMODULES\n\nHIGHLAND PIT\nPLAGIOCLASE\nORE\n\nr-2km--j\n\na.\n\n282\n\nFINE-GRAINED\nILMENITE\nMODULE\n\n~10m-i\n\nb.\n\nFigure 10.- Schematic maps of the lunar mining (a) and\nbeneficiation operations (b).

Although the separation of fine-grained ilmenite is primarily dictated by its\npotential as an H2 ore, its separation does supplement\nilmenite production by about 25 percent and thus its\nearly emplacement is favored.\nFigure 1O(b) also illustrates another recommended\npart of a mining system - stockpiles. Space must be\nprovided for stockpiles since they are essential so that, if\na subsystem breaks down, the entire system will not be\nautomatically crippled. The locations of the packaging\nplant and mass driver were not indicated in figure 10.\nAlthough we are certain that optimum sites for a mass\ndriver and mining operations can be found and developed, we are not as confident that both will exist within\na few hundred meters of each other. A connecting\ndelivery system should be considered in any final base\nplans, but cannot be adequately quantified until site\nlocations are defined. Finally, a problem implicit in\nfigure 6 must be considered briefly. Considerable waste\nmass will be generated during these operations\n(3X 10 6 tons, Le., ~3X 10 6 m 3 /yr at maximum mining\nrates). Although conveniently located craters can be\nfilled with wastes initially, back-filling the mine site is\nthe only feasible long-term solution. We have not analyzed this problem fully.\nTable 6 presents an analysis of bottom scraper design\nin terms of load, size, speed, mining rate, and haul\n\ndistance. The minimum pit separation that can be\nexpected is 300 m (ref. 6); we have used this value and\nthe pit sizes (table 4) to compute minimum haul distance and thus to compute trucking needs for lunar\nmining (table 7). Such vehicles would require about\n100 kW per vehicle, within the range of fuel cell systems\nof reasonable size and mass. However, it is obvious that,\nfor large-scale mining, the vehicles and mass involved\nbecome very large and are probably not feasible even\nwithout considerations of haul road construction and\nmaintenance.\nSince it is more likely that the pits will be several\nkilometers apart (fig. lO(a), ref. 6), trucks will probably\nnot be a feasible option, and a conveyor system, such as\nthat shown in figure 10(a), will be required. However,\nbecause of the general mobility and utility of trucks,\nseveral should be included in any base design. For comparison, an equivalent conveyor system is presented. The\nmasses reported are for one belt system of equivalent\nlength; power requirements will be about 100 kW/km.\nFinally, N\' represents the number of 50-ton capacity\nloaders necessary to load the conveyor, derived by\nextrapolating to zero-haul distance for the parameterization in table 7.\nAn automated mining system of the required capacity\ncould be developed: possibly a moderate-sized bucketwheel excavator (ref. 19) that would feed a shiftable\nconveyor system (ref. 18).

Since\nmuch of the mass is structural support, a lunar excavator\nwould be less massive. Experience indicates that bucket\nwheels on the excavator would last about 150-200 hr\n(ref. 19); however, a longer lifetime could be expected in\nexcavating loose soil. Replacement parts and facilities\nfor refitting and retooling must be available near the\nmine site. Maintenance and repair requirements must be\nconsidered in any advanced mining and beneficiation\nmodels.\nA mature mining operation would proceed as follows:\na shiftable conveyor would parallel the strip to be mined\n(fig. 1O(a)). The bucket-wheel excavator would mine a\n\n284\n\n50-m-wide strip parallel to the belt. After the strip had\nbeen mined to a depth of 2 m, the excavator would\nmove to the other pit and follow the same pattern. The\nunworked pit is backfilled with tailing from beneficiation. The shiftable belt would be pulled 50 m radially\ninto its new location by trucks (fig. 1O(a)). Each strip\nshould be mined in 12.524-hr days. The remaining\n1.5 days of the lunation would be used to startup and\nshutdown the operation. It will take almost 10 years to\nmine the two 2-km pits shown in figure lO(a) at\n1000 tons/hr. Stripping to depths greater than 2 m\nshould be possible; however, we have used 2 m for\nanalysis because regoliths of this depth can be expected\nat almost any location on the lunar surface.\n\nSummary of Mining and Beneficiation Scenario\nTable 8 summarizes the lunar mining and beneficiation scenario and the mass and installed-power requirements. The mass and power estimates were presented\nearlier and are subject to the constraints as noted. To\nstart the scenario, year -1 was chosen to display the\npre development mapping required. A rational mining\nand beneficiation scenario cannot be developed without\nthis step. Mining output for year 1 is too small to be\nanalyzed in the present context: it is quite literally a\ndump-truck and shovel operation that can be handled by\nthe base construction vehicles.\n\nAlthough much of the mining and beneficiation\noperation is amenable to automation, it cannot be\nunmanned. An integral part of the operation will be to\nclear boulders and hazards and to survey the mining cuts\nso that the excavator can be used to its fullest. The basic\ndevice used will probably be a clamshell shovel and\nbulldozer derived from the base construction vehicles; it\nwill probably be manned. Additional personnel will be\nrequired to maintain the machinery and to ensure\nquality control of the ore and concentrates. We estimate\nthat at least 10 men/shift (30 total) without support\npersonnel will be required, even with automation.\n\nTABLE 8.- MINING AND BENEFICIATION SCENARIO\nYear\n(lunar)\n-1\n1\n\nActivity\n\n~\n\nMass,\ntons\n\n~\n\nPower,\nkW\n\nDetailed mapping and exploration\nof site\n30,000 tons/yr, unbeneficiated\nOnly coarse sievesa\n\n2\n\n2\n\n10\n\n100\n\nOne plagioclase/ilmenite module a\n\n77\n\n272\n\nTwo 2-km permanent conveyor\n\n40\n\n400\n\nTwo large truck systems\n\n40\n\n200\n\nOne tine ilmenite module a\n\n77\n\n115\n\n154\n\n544\n\n40\n\n400\n\n77\n\n272\n\n460\n\n715\n\n-77\n1054\n\n272\n-3492\n\nMining by base construction\nVehicles\n2\n\n3\n\n717 ,000 tons/yr, beneficiated\n\n1,800,000 tons/yr, beneficiated\nTwo plagioclase/ilmenite modules a\nTwo shiftable conveyor systems\n\n4\n\n2,726,000 tons/yr, beneficiated\nOne plagioclase/ilmenite module a\nOne bucket wheel excavator a\n\n5\n\n3,656,000 tons/yr, beneficiated\nOne plagioclase/ilmenite module a\n\naMass not scaled for reduced gravity.\n\n285\n\nTABLE 9.- LUNAR GAS\nEXTRACTOR\n\nEXTRACTION OF VOLATILES FROM\nFINE-GRAINED ILM ENITE\nMuch of the beneficiation effort will be expended in\nobtaining a fine-grained ilmenite concentrate because of\nits potential as a hydrogen ore (ref. 6).

The released volatiles react amon g themselves and with the powder to\nreduce some ilmenite to iron ; the hyd roge n and ca rb on\nare ox idi ze d to water , carbon dioxide, and carbon\nmonoxide. Sulfur reacts with iron to form FeS which\nred uces sulfur gas species to negligible levels. Nitrogen\nand helium are unre acted. The partial pressure of water\nis great enough to cause liquid water to form in V 2 ; this\nextraction of water from the vapor ca uses mos t of the\nhydro ge n to react to water.

Such systems\nare commercially available for terrestrial use and are\namenable to high degrees of automation. However, the\nneed for maintenance and for clearing and surveying\noperations suggests that the installation will be manned.\nThe beneficiation of lunar plagioclase and ilmenite\nores is possible with existing technology. However, more\nadvanced techniques based on electrostatics and magnetics should be developed; these techniques require a\ndetermination of the properties of lunar minerals and\nbenchtop testing of devices on lunar materials or their\nsimilants. Beneficiation produces a system which is\nmaximized in terms of useful mass that reaches chemical\nprocessing. The beneficiation of lunar ores on the lunar\nsurface is useful and possible, but a full analysis must\nawait the results of laboratory studies.\nThe mining and beneficiation of lunar materials is\nneither an enormously large operation nor is it a small\noperation. Consequently, it is difficult to evaluate the\nsensitivity of economic models of non terrestrial industries to these operations. Further study, particularly of\nother models and optimization, should be undertaken.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. O\'Neill, Gerard K.: Testimony on Solar Power from\nSatellites.
