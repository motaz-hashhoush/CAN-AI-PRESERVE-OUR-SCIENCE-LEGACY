As an example, when\nadditional weight is applied to one end of the beam and\nthe piston rod exerts a force on the other end of the\nbeam, the beam often swings past its balanced position\ndue to the inertia of the beam. This movement of the\nbeam will be picked up by the control system and interpreted as a change in weight rather than an overcon10 t&. When this happens a change will be made which\nCT OF THE DISCLOSURE\nwill reduce the force applied to the beam by the piston\nThe invention is a pressure balance that employs a\nrod and permit the beam to swing back th~oughto an\npivotally mounted beam.

Beam 10 has a\nplatform 14 mounted on one end thereof which provides\na pedestal upon which weights 16 of varying values can\nbe placed. A rod 18 extends from a piston 20 slidably\ndisposed in a cylinder 22. Rod 18 engages end 24 of\npivotally mounted beam 10 and normally exerts a force\nthereon sufficient to balance weights 16. End 24 of beam\n10 is positioned between a pair of switch mechanisms\n26 and 28 so that pivotal movements of the beam will\nresult in actuation of one of the switch mechanisms.\nSwitch mechanism 26 consists of Slow In and Fast In\ncontrol contacts connected through a valve control means\n30 into Slow and Fast In solenoid valves 34 and 36 via\nlines 38 and 40. The valve control means include various\nrelays, a transformer, and two time delay circuits which\nare schematically illustrated in FIGURE 3 and more\nfully discussed hereafter. The Fast and Slow In valves\nadmit air from a high pressure source 42 and regulator\n44 into surge tank 46. The surge tank is in direct cornmunication with cylinder 22 through conduit 47 and a\nnormally opened valve 48. Also, the surge tank is connected to the instrument being calibrated (not shown)\nvia a line 49.\nSwitch mechanism 28 is very similar in structure and\noperation to switch mechanism 26 except that it functions\nto vent pressure from the surge tank and thus reduce the\npressure within cylinder 22 and reduce the force applied\nto beam 10. Switch mechanism 28 is connected through\na suitable valve control means 50 into Slow and Fast Out\nvalves 52 and 54, via lines 56 and 58 which vent surge\ntank 46 to the atmosphere.\nAs mentioned above, surge tank 46 is in direct cornmunication with cylinder 22 through normally open valve\n48. ~ h u s the pressure within the surge tank is the same\n,\nas that within the cylinder and a pressure gauge connected into the surge tank pressure via line 49 should\nindicate a pressure which agrees with a calculated Pressure for cylinder 22. It is a relatively simple matter to\ncalculate the Pressure within the surge tank since the\nweight 16 applied to platform 14 is a known quantity and\nthe cross sectional area of piston 20 is also known.\nby appropriate calculations the pressure within the cylinder can be calculated, which calculated pressure should\nagree with the pressure reading of the gauge being tested\nif the pressure gauge is accurate.\nthe drawing where\nReferring\nswitch mechanism 28 is illustrated. Since switch mechanism 26 and 28 are identical, a decription of One will\nsuffice for both. Switch mechanism 28 includes an outer\nhousing 60 in which contact plungers 62 and 64 are slidably mounted by means of suitable collar and bushing\nmeans, discussed hereafter. End 66 of contact plunger 62\nwhen the beam beis contacted by end 24 of beam\ncomes overbalanced in a counter-cloc~wise direction.\nContact plunger 62 is held in position by a collar 68 that\nis threaded into the top of housing 60. ~\nl portion\n~\n70 of contact plunger 62 abuts one end of collar 68 to\nlimit the upward travel of plunger 62 and also serves as\na surface against which spring 72 encircling the contact\nplunger can react to bias the contact plunger in an up-\n\nwardly direction. Spring 72 is retained in a position about\nthe contact plunger by means of a retainer collar 74\nthreadably mounted to an interior surface of housing\n60. It is readily apparent from considering the switch\nmechanism that the biasing force of spring 72 is controlled by the vertical position of retainer 74. Collar 68\nis locked into position by a setscrew 76 which threads\ninto housing 60 and jams collar 68. Likewise, retainer 74\nis locked into position by a similar setscrew 78, however; setscrew 78 also functions as an electrical contact\nto which a lead 80 is attached by suitable means such as\nsoldering. End 82 of contact plunger 62 extends below\nretainer 74 in a position where it can engage upper end\n84 of lower contact plunger 64 and end 82 also has an\nelectrical lead 79 connected theert0.C ontact plunger 64 is\nheld in position by a retainer nut 88 threaded into housing 60 and a second retainer nut 90 threaded into recess\n92 in retainer nut 88. Contact plunger 64 has a flanged\nportion 94 formed thereon which limits upward movement of plunger 64 by bottoming in recess 92. Spring 96\npositioned around contact plunger 64 reacts against flange\n94 and retainer nut 90 to bias contact plunger 64 in an\nupward direction. Again, it is readily apparent that the\nclearance between ends 82 and 84 of the contact plungers\nis controlled by the positioning of retainer nut 88 and\nthe biasing force spring 96 exerts on plunger 64 is determined by the position of retainer nut 90 within retaining collar 88. An electrical lead 95 is attached to the\nlower end of contact plunger 64.\nThe operation of the switch mechanism is as follows:\nWhen beam 10 of the pressure balance is sufficiently rotated about its pivot point in a counter-clockwise direction,\nend 24 of the beam will engage end 66 of the contact\nplunger. If the engagement is slight it results in only a\nsmall pressure being applied to plunger 62 and the plunger\nwill not be depressed enough to engage end 84 of contact\nplunger 64. In this instance a circuit will be completed\nwhich consists of beam 10, contact plunger 62 and lead\nline 80 in electrical contact with plunger 62. If the engagement of beam 10 with plunger 62 causes end 82 of plunger\n62 to engage end 84 of plunger 64 then the circuit described above will be completed and also a circuit will\nbe completed consisting of lead 79, contact plunger 64,\nand lead 95. The significance of the two circuits will be\nmore fully appreciated when FIGURE 3 is discussed.\nSuffice it to say presently that completion of the first circuit\nactuates the Slow Out valve to slowly vent the surge tank\nwhereas completion of both the first and second circuit\nwill actuate both the Fast Out valve and the Slow Out\nvalve. When the pressure in the surge tank is vented and\nthe force exerted on contact plunger 62 by beam 1 0 is\n1\nlessened, the plunger will be biased upwardly by spring\n72 and break contact with contact plunger 64, thus, opening the circuit which closes the Fast o u t\nthe\nsurge tank continues to vent through the Slow Out valve,\nthe force exerted on end 24 of beam BO will continue to\ndecrease until beam 10 swings out of contact with contact\nplunger 62. When this occurs of course the circuit actuating the slow o u t valve will be broken and venting of\nthe surge tanks will cease.\nSwitch mechanism 26 is identical to switch mechanism\n28 just described except that when actuated this switch\nmechanism functions to admit pressure to the surge tank\nvia the ~~~t\nand slow In valves which are connected\nto a supply of pressurized air through pressure regulator &.\nof the drawing is an\nto\ntrical schematic for the invention, the schematic will be\ndescribed by discussing the sequence of operation that occurs after a weight has been removed from beam lo and\nthe beam is unbalanced in a counter-clockwise direction\n~\n~\n~\nd\ndue to the action of piston rod 18 on end 24 of the beam.\nThis pushes the beam against contact plunger 62 which\nconnects lead 80 to beam 80 and thus completes a circuit\nwhich energizes Slow Out relay 800 to close normally\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n3,472,059\n5\nopen contact points 102. It should be understood that\nrelay 100 is shown only schematically and that it includes a coil (shown) surrounding an iron core (not\nshown) to form an electromagnet, and normally open\ncontact points 102. Contact points 102 would include a\nspring (not shown) or spring action that would normally\nbias the points to an open position. However, when the\ncoil of relay 100 is energized the core (not shown) becomes a magnet that generates sufficient magnetic force to\novercome the spring force normally opening the contact\npoints and thus close the contact points. This is the norma1 mode of operation of simple relays and such relays\nare available with either normally open or normally\nclosed contacts. Closing of contact points 102 energizes\na Slow Out solenoid 104 which in turn activates Slow Out\nvalve 52 to vent the surge tank. It will be noted that one\nside of contact points 102 are connected to the 110 volts\nAC side of isolation transformer 103 through line 105 and\nthe other side of contact points 102 is connected to the\nother side of the 110 volt AC source through Slow Out\nvalve 104 and also through a time delay circuit 106 via\ndiode 108. When the time delay circuit 106 is energized\nthe normally closed contacts 110 are opened and capacitor 112 is charged. When the time delay circuit is\nde-energized, the capacitor discharges across time delay\nrelay 113 to hold contact points 110 open for a suitable\ntime period of, for example, three seconds. Controls to\nadmit air to the surge tank and cylinder cannot be actuated during this time period of three seconds. The reason\nfor this time delay will be more clearly apparent when the\nSlow In portion of the circuit is described.\nFurther rotation of beam 10 in a counter-clockwise\ndirection will result in contact plunger 62 being depressed\nsufficiently to engage contact plunger 64 thereby completing a second circuit by connecting electrical lead 79 to\nlead 94. When this occurs a Fast Out relay 114 is energized to close contact points 116 and energize Fast Out\nsolenoid 115 which in turn opens Fast Out valve 54 to\nrapidly vent surge tank 46. As the pressure within the\nsurge tank is decreased, the amount of force applied to\nthe beam by piston rod 18 is reduced and thus the beam\ncan rotate in a clockwise direction to permit contact\nplunger 62 to become disengaged from contact plunger\n64 and thereby de-energize the Fast Out portion of the\nsystem. Further venting of the surge tank will result in\nthe beam 10 becoming disengaged from contact plunger\n62 and the entire venting portion of the system will become inactive. Should beam 1 pivot in a clockwise direcO\ntion a sufficient amount to engage the Slow In switch\nmechanism, either because of an added weight applied to\none end of the pivot beam, or due to inertia of the beam\nas it swings up to a balanced position, a circuit will be\nclosed by connecting end 24 of beam 10 to leadline 118.\nThis will, assuming contact points 110 are closed, energize coil 120 in Slow In relay 122, to close normally\nopened contacts 124. It will be noted that coil 120 is connected to the 110 volts provided by a half wave rectifying\ncircuit 101 connected to one side of transformer 103\nthrough contact points 110 of the time delay circuit. Thus\ncoil 120 cannot be energized nor contact points 124 closed\nwhen contact points 110 are open. Contact points 110\nare normally closed except when the time delay relay\n113 is actuated as occurs when the Slow or Fast Out relays are actuated or during the time delay period when\ncapacitor 112 is discharging through the time delay relay\nafter circuit 106 has been de-energized. The circuit 106\nis de-energized when the Slow and Fast Out relays are\nde-energized due to clockwise movement of the pivotally mounted beam. Thus, the Slow In relay cannot be\nenergized and contact points 124 closed for a period of,\nfor example, three seconds after the venting or Out portion\nof the system has been de-energized and therefore a time\ndelay is introduced that permits system conditions like\nair temperature and spring forces to stabilize so as to prevent over controlling of the beam.\n\n6\n\nThe closing of contact points 124 completes a circuit to\nconnect Slow In solenoid 126 to the I10 volt AC power\nsupply. Closing of the contact points 3124 also causes time\ndelay circuit 128 to be energized via diode 130. Actuation of the time delay circuit results in the trnle delay\nrelay 132 being energized to open normally closed contact points 134. In addition, capacitor 136 is chaiged\nso that when the time delay circuit is de-energized it wii!\ndischarge across time delay relay 132 to holcl contact\n10 points 134 open for a period of, for example, three seconds. It will be noted that the coil of the Slow Out relay\nis connected to the 110 volts DC through contact points\n134. Thus, when contact points 134 are open the Slow\nOut relay cannot be energized.\nFurther clockwise rotation of the pivotall) n~ouilted\n15\no\nbeam will result in lead 138 being connected t lead 140\nto complete a circuit which results in coil 142 of Fast In\nrelay 144 being energized to close contact points 146 and\nthus energize Fast In solenoid 148 which will in turn\n20 actuate Fast In valve 36 and result in a rapid increase in\nthe pressure in surge tank 46. This plessure iaci ease will\nbe communicated to the interior of cylinder 22 and result in piston rod 18 exerting additional force or; the bean1\n10 to overcome the rotational effects ef any wcight placed\n25 thereon. Every component and leadline of the circuit\nshown in FIGURE 3 has not been labeled, but the circuit\nhas been described in sufficient detail, it is believed, to\npermit an understanding thereof.\nReferring now to FIGURES 4 and 5 of the diawings\n30 there is shown an alternate embodiment of a switch\nmechanism that detects an unbalanced cond~t~on a\nof\npivotally mounted beam and completes control circuits\nthat actuate various components of a system t rebalance\no\nthe beam. Switch mechanism 150 is drfferent in structure,\n35 but similar in function to the switch rnechar~sl-n28 discussed heretofore. However, switch mechanism 100 is\nsomewhat more elaborate in that it makes possible fast,\nintermediate and slow control rather than only fast and\nslow control as did switch mechanisnl 28. The switch\n40 mechanism includes a housing 102 having a c c ~ t r a l\naperture 154 formed therein which accommodates one end\nof a pivotally mounted beam 156. Housing 152 has a\nplurality of switches 158 through I63 mounted therein\nwhich are actuated by movement of beam 156. Each of\n45 the switch mechanisms are identical in structure, but\nthey are calibrated differently depending upon whether or\nnot they are used to actuate the slow, intermediate or\nfast portion of the control circuit to which they are connected. Since the switch mechanisms are substantially\n50 identical only one will be described in detail. Switch 158,\nfor example, includes (see FIGURE 5 ) a houslng 865\nhaving a contact plunger 167 slidably disposed therein\nDownward movement of contact plunger 167 is limrted\nby flange 169 formed thereon and the plunger is biased\n55 downwardly by coil spring 170 encircling the contact\nplunger. The contact plunger is retained within housing\n165 by spring 170 acting on flange 192 and a retaincr cap\n174 threaded into bore 176 of housing 165. It is believed\nreadily apparent from a consideration of FIGURE 5\n60 that the preload on spring 170 can be adjusted by vertical\nmovement of retainer cap 174. The retainer cap is locked\ninto position by locknut 176.\nReferring again to FIGURE 4, it can be scen that the\nlower ends of the contact plungers 167 are spaced from\n65 the surface of beam 156 an increasing amwnt from left\nto right. This is necessary since opposed switch mechanisms 160 and 161 actuate Slow In and O ~ ivalves whereas\nt\nswitch mechanisms 159 and 162 actuate Intermediate ~n\nand Out valves and switch mechanisms 158 and 163\n70 actuate Fast In and Out valves. The spacing of the ends\nof contact plungers 167 from the bea~nbas been considerably exaggerated in FIGURE 4 for purposes of clarity.\nIn actual practice the spacing variation wollld be very\nslight and proper operation of the various switching\n75 mechanisms would be accomplished not only by spacing\n\n359\n\n7\n\n8\n\nof the contact plunger from the beam, but by h e adjustment of the preload on spring 170.\nThe operation of this switch mechanism, which is believed readily apparent, is as follows: assuming that a\nweight has been applied to the beam so as to cause end\n156 of the beam to be pivoted in an upward direction as\nviewed in FIGURE 4. The beam would first engage the\ncontact plunger of switch mechanism 1B to actuate the\n6B\nSlow In portion of a system so as to increase the force\napplied to beam 156 by the piston rod. If the weight applied to beam 156 is sufficient, the upward deflection of\nthe beam will be great enough to actuate both switches\n159 and 158. As the piston rod exerts an increasing force\non the beam due to increased pressure within the piston\nand cylider apparatus, the beam will become disengaged\nfrom contact plungers 167 of switch mechanisms 158,\n159 and 160 in order as the beam approaches a balanced\nposition.\nReferring now to FIGURES 6 and 7 of the drawing, a\nparticular application of the invention will be discussed\nalong with the advantageous mode of operation made\npossible by the rapid and precise control of the pivotally\nmounted beam. In FIGURE 6 a pressure balance is connected into a manifold 176 to provide a desired pressure\nlevel therein. The manifold is connected to a series of\npressure instruments 178 through valves 188. The pressure instruments are in turn connected to a launch or\nspace vehicle 182 undergoing, for example, fabrication\nand test on a static test stand. Valves 184 are normally\npositioned between each one of the pressure instruments\n178 and a component being monitored within space vehicle 182. A launch vehicle has a large number of pressure responsive or actuated components and it is necessary to continually monitor these components during\nfabrication and test of the vehicle. Likewise it is necessary\nto frequently check the pressure instruments used to\nf\nmonitor these components to assure their accuracy. I\nthe instruments 178 are being used to monitor components within the space vehicle, valves 180 are closed and\nvalves 184 are opened. When it is desired to test the\ninstruments valves 184 are closed and valves 180 are\nopened to admit pressure from manifold 176 to the instruments. The pressure within the manifold is regulated\nover a range of pressures in a manner discussed heretofore and this range of pressures is communicated to the\npressure instruments via valves 180. One of the pressure\ninstruments T is connected into a recorder 184 which\nmonitors and prepares a record (see FIGURE 7) of the\npressures applied to instruments 178. The actual pressure vs. time trace made by recorder 184 when monitoring a pressure balance would appear as the trace labeled\n186 in FIGURE 7 and would not include the trace labeled\n188. Trace 188 is included to show the record which\nwould be obtained when monitoring a pressure balance of\nthe type available heretofore. It will be noted that trace\n186 does not overshoot and then fall below (oscillate)\neach of the pressure levels labeled A and B as does trace\n188. It is obvious that the time required to stabilize the\npressure balance at each pressure level has been greatly\nreduced and thus the time required to test a pressure instrument over a range of, for example, 100 pressure levels,\nis considerably lessened. More significant is the fact that\nthere is no overshoot or oscillation at each pressure level.\nThe characteristic of recording instruments are such (hysteresis for example) that a test may have to be run\nover if there is any overshoot at any pressure level during the test.\nWhat is claimed is:\nI An apparatus for calibrating pressure instruments\n.\ncomprising:\n(a) a pivotally mounted beam adapted to have a predetermined weight placed on one end thereof and\na force applied to the other end thereof that precisely counters the rotational effects of said weight and\nbalances said beam;\n\n(b) a fluid pressure source;\n(c) pressure actuated means that includes a cylinder\nconnected into said fluid pressure source and positioned adjacent said other end of said beam, a piston\nand piston rod slidably disposed in said cylinder with\nsaid piston rod extending from said cylinder to engage said beam for applying force to the other end\nof said beam;\n(d) a plurality of valve means that includes slow and\nfast acting valves connected between said fluid pressure source and said pressure actuated means;\n(e) said plurality of valve means including:\n(1) a first slow valve for slowly increasing the\npressure in said cylinder and thus the force\nexerted by said piston assembly upon said beam;\n(2) a first fast valve for rapidly increasing the\npressure in said cylinder and thus the force\nexerted by said piston assembly upon said beam,\n(3) a second slow valve for slowly venting said\ncylinder to reduce the force applied by said piston assembly to said beam; and\n(4) a second fast valve for rapidly venting the\npressure in said cylinder to reduce the force applied by said piston assembly to said beam;\n(f) electrical switch means positioned adjacent said\nother end of said beam and operatively associated\ntherewith for sensing the position of said beam and\nselectively actuating said plurality of valve means\nto increase and decrease the pressure in said pressure\nactuated means and thereby change the force applied\nto said beam;\n(g) means for communicating the pressure in said\npressure actuated means to a pressure instrument\nbeing calibrated;\n(h) time delay means connected between said electrical\nswitch. means and said valve means for delaying the\nactuation of said valve means to increase the pressure in said pressure actuated means for a predetermined time period immediately after the pressure in\nsaid pressure actuated means has been decreased and\nalso for delaying the actuation of said valve means\nto decrease the pressure in said pressure actuated\nmeans for a predetermined time period immediately\nafter the pressure in said pressure actuated means has\nbeen increased.\n2. The apparatus recited in claim 1 wherein said electrical switch means comprises:\n(a) a first electrical contact plunger adapted to engage\none side of the other end of said beam when the\nother end of said beam is deflected upwardly by a\nweight applied to the one end thereof, thus completing a circuit that results in actuation of said first\nslow valve;\n(b) a second electrical contact plunger adapted to be\nengaged by said first contact plunger to complete a\nsecond circuit which results in actuation of said first\nfast valve;\n(c) a third electrical contact plunger adapted to engage the other side of the other end of said beam\nwhen the other end of said beam pivots downwardly\ndue to removing some of the weight applied to the\none end of said beam; whereby a third circuit is completed that results in actuation of said second slow\nvalve;\n(d) a fourth electrical contact plunger adapted to be\nengaged by said third contact plunger to complete\na fourth circuit which results in actuation of said\nsecond fast valve, said first and second fast valves being actuated only when said beam is deflected to a\ngreater extent than that required to actuate said first\nand second slow valves.\n3.
