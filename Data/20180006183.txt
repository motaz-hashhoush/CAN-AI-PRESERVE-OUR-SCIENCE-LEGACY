The present\nreport examines the resultant electric aircraft possibilities and opportunities\nincluding technologies to reduce requisite battery size and weight via airframe\nperformance improvements, the benefits of electric propulsion and the enablement\nof a massive new aeronautics market for affordable, safe personal air vehicles that\noperate off of local streets.\nIntroduction\nThe Major initial driver for electric transportation, including electric aircraft,\nhas been the reduction of emissions. Renewable energy for charging and operating\nelectric transportation is developing rapidly. Renewable energy comprises 25% of\nall electric generation [ref. 1] and 62% of all new generation [ref. 2]. Costs are\nreducing rapidly and efficiency and storage technologies are improving across a\nwide range of renewable sources. Therefore going forward, to the extent that ever\nmore electrical generation is from renewable sources, electric transportation should\nbe nearly emission-less. What electricity replaces in transportation is largely\nheavy transportation fuels, mainly petroleum. Additionally, electric motors for\ntransportation propulsion are far more efficient by a factor of two or more, lighter\nweight, contain far fewer parts, cost less and are easier to maintain than internal\ncombustion (IC) and gas turbine engines (GTE) [ref 3]. The usual approaches to\nreducing aircraft emissions is via either improving performance to reduce fuel use\nor through using hydrogen fuel. The former is only a partial solution and would\ntake decades of development to achieve incremental improvements. The latter\nproduces water above the tropopause and forms thin cirrus clouds that reflect\noutgoing infrared radiation back to the surface of the Earth. Battery Electric\nPropulsion constitutes a solution to all of the emissions issues, NOx, CO2 and\n\n1\n\nwater. The latter, estimated as the most worrisome climate impacting emission,\nwould be eliminated by battery and airframe developments, market pull, the rise of\nrenewable energy production and cost reductions.\nElectric Aircraft propulsion can be envisaged for all classes of aircraft, from\nsmall drones and personal air vehicles to long haul and supersonic transports. The\nissue of long standing for electric aircraft has been what to do about the long\nextension cord: i.e. the size, weight, and functionality of the electricity source. The\nextensive battery research and development instigated by the development of\nelectric ground vehicles has direct application to, and has created a renaissance in\nelectric aircraft, both with respect to applications and design. The nominal battery\ngoal for widespread electrification of aircraft is the energy density of chemical\nheavy transportation fuels. We are now approaching system parity via the\nextensive research on lithium-air, lithium-metal and solid-state batteries coupled\nwith highly efficient electric motors along with vehicle weight and drag reductions.\nResearch has now resulted in Li-Air batteries achieving 15 times the energy\ndensity of lithium-ion batteries [ref 4], and other research has achieved 750\nrecharge cycles [ref 5]. Also there is the announcement of a 500Wh/kg lithiummetal battery on the market in the nearer future. When coupled with electric\nmotors that are two times more efficient and a more efficient airframe, system\nlevel parity can be envisioned. Therefore, in the current discussion it is assumed\nthat the combination of greatly improved airframes via the concepts and\ntechnologies presented herein combined with the ongoing battery research could in\na decade or less produce electric aircraft approaching system level parity with IC\nand GTE. This parity will open the entire speed range for electric aircraft\ntransportation, up to and including supersonic speeds. Electric power does have\nthe drawback of a fixed, or increasing, propulsion energy weight versus the weight\nreduction achieved as transportation fuels are burned. For long flights, this can\nproduce up to a 20% range reduction unless mitigated by the many technologies\nand design approaches discussed herein [ref 6]. Indicated herein is a synopsis of\ntechnology approaches which could be applied to further improve the performance\nof electric aircraft, and reduce the required battery capacity to achieve system level\nparity.\nThere are two issues, besides battery capability, that will dictate the future of\nelectric aircraft. First is the massive societal shift to tele-everything and virtual\nreality, including tele-travel. The second issue is the time scale to produce the\nrequired infrastructure, including certification, to accommodate the recharge\ncapability and the air traffic control (ATC) and Information Technology (IT)\ncapabilities required. The enabling ATC and IT systems for the extraordinarily\n\n2\n\nlarge numbers of expected autonomous personal air vehicles is particularly\nchallenging. Their numbers will also require designing for as near to \xe2\x80\x9ccrash-proof\xe2\x80\x9d\nas possible while ensuring trusted autonomy for both the vehicles and the ATC\nsystem.\nAdvantages of Electric Propulsion\n\xe2\x80\x90 No motor gear boxes\n\xe2\x80\x90 Regenerative energy recovery during descent and landing\n\xe2\x80\x90 Battery heat production could be utilized for cabin heating, deicing, or\nregeneration via thermoelectric generators\n\xe2\x80\x90 Higher altitude operation feasible\n\xe2\x80\x90 Reduced cooling drag\n\xe2\x80\x90 Quieter\n\xe2\x80\x90 Reduced vibration\n\xe2\x80\x90 Fewer inspections\n\xe2\x80\x90 No engine flameouts or restarts\n\xe2\x80\x90 No fuel explosions during crashes\n\xe2\x80\x90 Power train efficiency greater than 90%, nominally twice or greater than IC\nand GTE chemically fueled propulsion\n\xe2\x80\x90 Much lower energy costs\n\xe2\x80\x90 No power lapse with altitude at high temperatures\n\xe2\x80\x90 Continuously variable transmission\n\xe2\x80\x90 High reliability\n\xe2\x80\x90 High efficiency over most of the power envelope\n\xe2\x80\x90 Up to six times motor power to weight compared to combustion engines\n\xe2\x80\x90 Reduced maintenance\n\xe2\x80\x90 Far fewer parts\n\xe2\x80\x90 Less expensive\n\xe2\x80\x90 Higher torque\n\xe2\x80\x90 No vehicle emissions\n\xe2\x80\x90 Distributed, scalable propulsion\nSee ref 7 for a cogent discussion of the history and potential outlook for\nelectric aircraft.\nTechnologies Which Could Reduce the Electrical Power Requirements via\nLighter Weight and/or Lower Drag\n\n3\n\nFlow Control, or Designer Fluid Mechanics [ref 8] - Designer Fluid Mechanics\nsubsumes a large number of flow control approaches and applications. These\ninclude laminar flow control (LFC): i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d, pressure gradient induced at low\nsweep, and forced or controlled; mixing enhancement;, separated flow control\nespecially for high lift, inlets, shock and boundary layer interactions; vortex control\nincluding managing the wake vortex hazard and maneuverability; turbulence\ncontrol and drag reduction; favorable wave interference and drag reduction and\ndesigner fluids for internal systems. Flow control at cruise to allow inviscid\nperformance optimization, smart controllers for load alleviation and trim drag\nreduction along with residual drag cleanup require additional study and\noptimization. A vast number of flow control methods are available that have been\ntried and sometimes applied to experimental aircraft designs. These methods\ninclude suction, injection, various body forces, surface motions, localized energy\nrelease, additives, surface permeability and heating or cooling. Research in this\narena has for some two decades been moving from passive control approaches to\nfirst active and then reactive. Due to systems and applications considerations, by\nfar the bulk of the flow control applications have been passive devices. The now\ndecades long development of smart, multi-functional materials might alter this\nconventional propensity toward passive flow control for applications. Considering\nLaminar Flow Control, this has been under active research since the 1930\xe2\x80\x98s with\nmost applications thus far being of the pressure gradient, \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d laminar flow\nvariety at relatively low chord Reynolds number on General Aviation (GA)\naircraft. Until the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s LFC was bedeviled by issues of insect remains and other\nroughness and waviness. As improved materials and approaches mitigated these\nconcerns it was the relatively low fuel cost that prevented forced LFC from\n\xe2\x80\x9cbuying its way\xe2\x80\x9d onto the aircraft in spite of numerous research flight experiments\ndemonstrating feasibility and performance. With the advent of the issue of battery\nweight for electric vehicles, LFC is again under active consideration, to reduce the\nrequisite battery capacity. Another issue, which has delayed the adoption and\nutilization of some flow control devices, has been facility capability shortfalls. In\nparticular, except for the National Transonic Facility/European Transonic Wind\nTunnel (NTF/ETW), a lack of Reynolds number to simulate the wake vortex\nhazard has hampered the further development of devices and approaches to\nmitigate the hazard. The vortex dissipation in the typical low Reynolds number\nfacility causes quite a different vortex behavior and decay than in the high\nReynolds number flight case. Also, the lack of low disturbance transonic facilities\nhas been a problem not yet overcome for certification of LFC systems for long\nhaul transports. For turbulent drag reduction, especially with respect to the\nfuselage, a critical flow control arena once drag due to lift (DDL), and wing\nfriction drag, minimized via LFC are reduced, the options, aside from\n\n4\n\nrelaminarization, are few currently. Obviously shorter and wider fuselages,\nwithout incurring wave drag, reduce wetted area. Riblets have been flight tested\nand can provide an approximate 8% turbulent skin friction reduction. There is an\nopportunity to somehow operationalize the research observations that oscillatory\ntransverse wall motions can reduce turbulent viscous drag in air flow up to the\norder of 45%. Overall, electric propulsion proffer the possibility of straightforward\ndistributed energy and effector distribution and location, especially for flow\nseparation control.\nAero/Propulsion Synergies [ref 9] \xe2\x80\x93 Conventional design practice in civilian\naeronautics is to essentially separate the aerodynamics and the propulsion system.\nThe military, for over half a century has in many cases utilized synergistic\ncombinations of aero and propulsion to obtain improved functionality, often for\nenhanced high lift performance. Such synergistic combinations are equivalent to\napproaching the overall aero design problem in an open thermodynamic system\nwhere energy and mass properties are added to the overall design space. Examples\nof such aero-propulsive synergies include the following:\n\xe2\x80\x90 Circulation Control Wings: produce up to a factor of four increase in Cl to\nnearly the theoretical 4Pi maximum, potential reduced cost and part count\nfor high lift and improved control and maneuverability.\n\xe2\x80\x90 Boundary Layer Inlet: Ingesting lower momentum air, where the fuselage\nand other aero skin friction reduction technologies has already produced up\nto 10% to 15% propulsion efficiency increase.\n\xe2\x80\x90 Wing Tip Engines: As discussed in the subsequent drag\xe2\x80\x90due\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90lift reduction\nsection, placing the engines on the wing tip can for short span wings, reduce\nthe drag\xe2\x80\x90due\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90lift experimentally by up to 40%. The engine nacelle acts as\nan endplate, the engine energy and mass addition change, to first order, the\ndynamics of the wing tip vorticity rollup and also reduces the wake vortex\nhazard. Wing strut and truss bracing are conducive to wing tip engine\nplacement. A related aero-propulsion interaction approach is wing tip\ninjection, which also reduces the wake vortex hazard and drag-due\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90lift.\n\xe2\x80\x90 Thrust Vectoring: Placing the engines at the rear of the fuselage and utilizing\nthem for aero controls in lieu of the weight and drag of the empennage is a\nmajor performance enhancer.\n\xe2\x80\x90 Goldschmied Thrusting Cowl: Goldschmieds\xe2\x80\x99 research indicated that\nplacing a cowl around engines in the back, with boundary layer inlets,\nessentially puts potential flow sinks inside the body and increases the\npressure on the back of the cowl, acquiring additional thrust in the process\nvia aero\xe2\x80\x90propulsion synergy. Research is underway to verify this assertion.\n\n5\n\nThe submarine community, which utilizes such shrouded pump jets quite\ncommonly, have accrued some additional performance benefits. The issues\nappear to be whether the benefits claimed by Goldschmied, up to some half\nof the fuselage friction drag, are obtainable. The boundary layer inlet\npropulsion improvements are the zeroth order effect of such a cowl.\n\xe2\x80\x90 Hybrid Laminar Flow with leading edge suction utilized for high lift\nseparation control: The suction from the engine used for Hybrid wing\nLaminar flow at cruise can be used for skin friction reduction during takeoff\nfor flow separation control during the high lift configuration.\nWave Drag Reduction [ref 10] \xe2\x80\x90 The usual linear theory engendered\napproaches to wave drag reduction (WDR) include wing sweep, area ruling and\nreduced thickness as well as wing twist, camber and warp. More recently,\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) nonlinear methods have been applied,\nresulting in further optimizations. Classical non-linear WDR techniques include\nuse of nose spikes, either physical or via forward projection of energy, gases,\nliquids or particulates to extend effective body length. This is particularly useful\nfor blunt nosed bodied vehicles for sonic boom reduction, and for base blunting\nwhich reduces the strength of the base recompression shock.\nAll of the WDR methods mentioned thus far involve weakening the shock.\nThere is another whole class of approaches, which utilize favorable shock\ninterference. The fundamental approach is simple in concept \xe2\x80\x93 utilize shock\nwaves, via reflection or interaction, to create a favorable interference either for\nbody thrust or lift, or both. Generally volume distributions are utilized to\nsynergistically create lift, and lift distributions are utilized to cancel volume drag.\nRealizations of favorable interference include ring wings and the related parasol\nwings; multiple bodies: fuselages, control surfaces, wing pods; and propulsion\nsystem interaction. For nonlifting bodies a ring wing can cancel, at the designed\nMach number, the volume wave drag of the body, e.g. Busemann\xe2\x80\x99s Biplane. This\nis however, at the expense of an increased wetted area, weight, etc. For the lifting\ncase the parasol wing provides both partial cancellation of the body and nacelle\nvolume wave drag and an efficient lifting surface. The application of favorable\ninterference would be facilitated by flow separation control and active controls\nfacilitated by electrical actuation or pumping. Various experimental evaluations of\nfavorable wave interference have resulted in far less than the expected inviscid\nperformance levels due to the detuning and drag associated with flow separation\ncaused by the concomitant shock wave-boundary layer interactions. The plethora\nof flow separation approaches currently extant, if employed at cruise conditions,\nshould enable favorable nearly inviscid performance levels. One such approach is\n\n6\n\nthe use of passive porous surfaces. Flow separation control utilized during cruise\ncould also greatly increase the percentage of lift carried on the upper surface as\nexpansion waves, as opposed to the conventional lower surface shock wave rider\napproach. The use of active flow control would allow both enhanced on-design\nand improved off-design performance via shock locus tailoring. As an order of\nmagnitude estimate, parasol favorable interaction Supersonic Transport [SST]\nwings can provide on the order of a 20% improvement in overall lift-to-drag ratio\nat cruise.\nDrag\xe2\x80\x90Due\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90Lift Reduction [ref 10] \xe2\x80\x90 Classical linearized theory indicates that\nelliptical loading, increased aspect ratio and span, lower lift coefficient values and\nreduced weight are the primary approaches to vortex drag-due-to-lift reduction\n(DDLR). Obviously increasing aspect ratio and span beyond a certain point\nbecomes inefficient overall due to structural penalties. While decreased lift\ncoefficient entails larger wings and both weight and wetted area as well as viscous\ndrag increases. The application of the extensive alternative solution set for vortex\nDDLR has been relatively sparse, with the exception of winglets. This is due to\nmany reasons including, depending upon the approach, structural weight, parasitic\ndrag and/or power. This has been addressed in many cases via creative overall\naircraft configuration design - e.g. truss braced wings. Relaxing the assumptions\nof classical linear theory (i.e. closed body, no energy addition, planar vortex sheet\netc.) provides alternative vortex DDLR possibilities. In particular, the use of nonplanar lifting surfaces, such as distributing the lift vertically through various\napproaches including upswept tips and multiple, vertically spaced wings can\nprovide sizable reductions, on the order of 15% . In addition to conventional nonplanar tips or span there are several interesting natural observations related to the\nmorphology of Avians and Nektons. These observations which may relate to\nDDLR include serrated trailing edges, leading edge bumps, and shark caudal fin\ntips and sheared tips. The vortex which forms at, and downstream of, the wing tip,\ncaused by the tip up wash from the high pressures on the lower surface, affects a\nsmaller percentage of the wing as aspect ratio increases. A characteristic feature of\nthis vortex formation is flow which is at an angle to the free stream. Devices can\ntherefore be inserted into this flow to produce or recover thrust and/or energy from\nthis tip flow. This is the fundamental rationale behind at least four devices which\nreduce DDL. These devices can obviously also have an influence upon the vortex\nformation process itself and thus may directly influence DDL. These devices\ninclude tip turbines for energy extraction, winglets, vortex diffuser vanes, tip sails\nand a plethora of other tip devices such as wing grids, spheroid and c-tips. The\nvortex diffuser vane is supported by a spar behind the wing tip to allow the vortex\nto concentrate before interception. These devices work quite well, depending upon\n\n7\n\nwing design and tip region loading and produce on the order of 5% to 15%\nreductions in DDL at CTOL conditions. Major application issues for these\ninclude, along with the usual concerns stated previously, their possible utilization\nas control devices. The following DDLR techniques are based upon either\neliminating the tip altogether or adding mass and/or energy in the tip region.\nEliminating the physical wing tips can be accomplished either via use of ring\nwings or joined wings and tails. Mass addition at or near the tip can be carried out\neither via tip blowing or through the use of wingtip engines, resulting in a sizable\nDDLR of up to 40%, depending upon wing design. Passive tip blowing could\npossibly be approached via wing leading edge ingestion allowing for increased\nwing thickness, with subsequent tip blowing. This can be used to tailor the\nproduction of, and modulated to excite, virulent tip vortex instabilities at landing\nand takeoff in order to ameliorate the wake vortex hazard. Positioning engines at\nthe wingtip requires aerodynamic theoretical developments in an open\nthermodynamic system since this is adding energy and species as well as mass.\nAlso, the engine nacelle can function as a tip device. Oscillatory span load\ndistributions have also been employed to reduce or obviate the wake vortex hazard.\nThis same approach could well yield interesting levels of DDLR and should be\ninvestigated for such. Other design options that need evaluation and possible\noptimization for DDLR include distributed propulsion and circulation control of\nfront and rear wing stagnation points, the latter to investigate the possibility of\nrotating the lift vector into the thrust direction. The truss braced wing, as currently\nconceived, reduces DDL 75% by the simple expedience of doubling the span. This\nis enabled by the structural characteristics of the external truss, creating a wholly\nnew set of optimization parameters and approaches. Additional DDLR concepts\ninclude formation flight and utilization of alternative sources of lift including\nbuoyancy, and thrust vectoring. The latter begins to be effective at high supersonic\nspeeds and is beneficial at hypersonic cruise. Buoyant lift typically replaces DDL\nwith a huge increase in wetted area and skin friction, producing an overall high\ndrag with, due to the large sizes and areas, undue sensitivity to weather.\nLanding Gear Weight Reduction \xe2\x80\x93 To a first approximation, landing gear is\n33% the weight of long haul transport fuselages and 63% the weight of SST\nfuselages. Therefore they constitute a target rich environment for vehicle weight\nreduction. Typically gear includes large, heavy brakes for refused takeoff. The\nmilitary has evidently used parachutes to handle refused takeoff, thereby accruing\nsizable weight reductions. The structure of the gear itself is typically sized for high\nimpact landings. Such landings could probably be minimized in frequency and\nimpact strength via autonomous operations, slaving the lift system to the ground\nproximity and descent rate. Also, the revolutionary materials currently at a lower\n\n8\n\nTRL level would, along with reducing the weight of other structures, reduce gear\nweight.\nRevolutionary Materials and Structures - There are several extant, but low\nTRL, approaches to significantly reducing the dry weight of aircraft via\nrevolutionary materials and structures. Now that we are printing at the nano scale,\nthe technology is developing to produce superb material microstructure, with far\nfewer dislocations and grain boundary problems, greatly improving the material\nperformance. Thus far a factor of order five has been achieved in some metal alloy\nsystems. These microstructure problems are largely produced during the historical\nmaterials processing approaches, which degrade performance by, in some cases, up\nto a factor of 20. Therefore a five time\xe2\x80\x99s improvement may not be the upper limit\nto the art of the possible. Another approach for ultra-performance materials is to\nattempt to merge nanotubes into a contiguous structural material. There are several\napproaches, with estimates of performance improvements in the 3X to 8X range.\nThere are also continuing efforts, with respect to composites, claiming 10X the\nperformance of aluminum. Also, there is work on storing electrical energy in\nstructures and skins [refs 11, 12], thus far using capacitor approaches to turn the\nwing surface into an energy storage device. In addition, additive manufacturing\ncan result in overall weight as well as cost reductions. Then there are the\ndevelopments in multifunctional, morphing materials for controls as well as\ntransitional flight modes along with materials with imbedded cellular micro\nstructures. Finally, Inflatable wings might be an interesting approach for some\nconfigurations, especially with respect to the transition between vertical and\nforward flight but also for inner sections of largely unswept thin truss-braced\ntransport wings. Revolutionary structures approaches include externally truss\nbraced wings along with going windowless, using viewscreens instead of windows\nexcept for emergency exit locations.\nElectric Aircraft Applications\nDrone/UAS/ODM/UAM/PAV \xe2\x80\x93 The Nearly concomitant development of IT\ncapabilities writ large - navigation, computing, automatics-to-autonomy,\nubiquitous sensors, and now electric propulsion and additive manufacturing has\nspawned a rapidly growing market in electric aircraft drones and UAS for many\napplications and functionalities [refs 13]. This in turn has instigated the now very\nrapidly developing efforts for what has been termed On Demand Mobility (ODM),\nincluding Urban Air Mobility (UAM). On Demand Mobility is initially piloted but\neventually becoming autonomous UAS carrying human passengers. The various\napproaches to accomplish this are nicely summarized in an UBER Elevate report\n\n9\n\nof 2016 [ref 3]. The initial markets targeted are centered on the city commute and\nat least initially would be fee-for-service and multi-passenger. Beyond the current\nUAM efforts lie electric autonomous Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) which operate\nout of the street in front of an individual holding. The estimated worldwide\nmarkets for PAV plus UAS, ODM, and UAM is in excess of a Trillion\ndollars/year, largely the current auto market.\nThe metrics for these include:\n\xe2\x80\x90 acquisition and operation costs,\n\xe2\x80\x90 safety,\n\xe2\x80\x90 ease of use,\n\xe2\x80\x90 acoustics,\n\xe2\x80\x90 close proximity operations,\n\xe2\x80\x90 reliability,\n\xe2\x80\x90 ride quality,\n\xe2\x80\x90 emissions,\n\xe2\x80\x90 range and efficiency\n\xe2\x80\x90 certification,\n\xe2\x80\x90 all weather operation to the extent possible or feasible,\n\xe2\x80\x90 crash proof\nIn addition to the enabling autonomous operational and ATC systems to\nprovide airspace access for many millions of vehicles.\nThe developed nations entered the 1900\xe2\x80\x99s with a transportation system, for people,\ncentered upon the horse, the railroad and the steamship, with associated travel\ntimes on the order of hours\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90days or weeks, depending upon distance. The\nautomobile has long supplanted the horse and the fixed wing aircraft has nearly\ndriven the railroads and steamship companies from the long-haul passenger\nbusiness. Travel times have shrunk to minutes\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90hours. These newer approaches\nhave also had a profound influence upon the structure of modern societies. In the\nU.S., cities have expanded out of 18th century seaports and 19th century railheads,\nwhere much of the developed region was, by necessity, within walking distance of\nthe transportation terminals, into tremendous automobile\xe2\x80\x90enabled suburbs with\nattendant reductions in crowding and increased opportunity for individual home\nownership. This section considers future possibilities/options for the\nnontransoceanic transportation spectrum, with emphasis upon the range from 10\xe2\x80\x99s\nto 100\xe2\x80\x99s, even thousands of miles. The current dominant transportation mode for\nthis mission into the hundreds of miles range is the automobile, which, possibly\nmore than any other single technical achievement, has enabled the current life style\n\n10\n\nenjoyed by the developed nations. In this process, the auto has created massive\nsafety problems, on the order of 40,000 deaths/year in the U.S. due to highway\naccidents \xe2\x80\x90 which is the order of the U.S. casualty count for the entire Vietnam\nWar. - Additionally, the automobile has been responsible for the expenditure of\ntruly prodigious sums on roads and bridges as well as being a source of pollution\xe2\x80\x90\ninduced health and material degradation requiring remediation and intervention of\nthe legal system. The current status of the auto infrastructure is that we continue to\nclear and pave more of the watershed, contributing to air pollution, flooding,\ndesiccation, the formation of heat islands and wildlife habitat degradation. Also,\nthe average trip time is increasing due to suburban expansion and increased\ncongestion, causing non\xe2\x80\x90trivial changes in family life as travelers attempt to utilize\nnon\xe2\x80\x90traditional time slots, or suffer long, nonproductive commutes. Society\ncannot, easily or otherwise, continue to bear the costs imposed by almost sole\nreliance upon the automobile for short\xe2\x80\x90to-intermediate passenger transport.\nAlternatives are necessary for the future, both for the developed societies and those\nthat desire to or are actively developing. Probably the most commonly advocated\nalternatives involve some form of mass transit, which have along with tremendous\ncapital costs, several other drawbacks such as passenger wait time, weather\nexposure and lack of privacy, security, pride of ownership and personal stowage.\nAdditional drawbacks are the fact that they are not portal\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90portal and there is no\nguarantee of having a seat, as well as an inherent assumption and economic realism\nregarding required population density and concentration. Undoubtedly, the future\nmix of short\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90intermediate transport systems will include both mass transit and\nautonomous automobiles. There is, however, both a need and an emerging\nopportunity to include in the transportation mix a personal air vehicle which would\nprovide, percentage\xe2\x80\x90wise, the same increase in speed compared to the auto in\ntraffic, as the auto provided over the horse. Personal air transportation usable by\neveryone is both revolutionary and the next logical step in the development of\nhuman infrastructure and corporal communication. The increased speed and\npotential safety improvements of such a capability, along with the greatly reduced\ncapital requirements in terms of highways and bridges, should allow significant\nincreases in the quality of life as well as reduced state and national public works\nbudgets. Specific benefits include distribution of the population over a much\nlarger area allowing a more peaceful and less damaging co\xe2\x80\x90existence of man and\nnature, along with improved transportation safety. The vision is of multilevel\nhighways in the sky, controlled and monitored by inexpensive and reliable\nelectronics and communications as opposed to narrow, single- level, exceedingly\nexpensive ribbons of concrete. Such air systems and vehicles could also obviously\nbe used for long(er) haul, as are automobiles today, e.g., travel of 500 miles or less\nis currently usually accomplished via auto. With a faster personal air vehicle this\n\n11\n\ndistance could be the order of 1500 miles or more. This in turn would have a\nmajor impact on domestic scheduled commercial air travel, 90 percent of which is\ndistances of 1500 miles or less. The various wait times associated with\ncommercial air travel, along with the inefficiencies in terms of transit time of the\nhub and spoke system, mitigate in favor of reduced overall trip time for possibly\nslower, but more direct, travel via personal aircraft when compared to the faster\ncommercial jet. Various options exist for personal aircraft systems. Certain\nrequirements and desirements are common to any personal transportation\nvehicle/system. These include, besides affordability, short transit time, high speed,\ndirect portal\xe2\x80\x90to portal, privacy and security, constant availability, personal stowage,\nsafety and a suitability for use by the non\xe2\x80\x90pilot. The latter necessitates from the\noutset that an obvious, and probably attainable, goal should be an autonomous\npersonal air transport system, autonomous with respect to navigation, air traffic\ncontrol and operation. The technology to accomplish this is either currently\nemployed by the long-haul air transport application, or in the research application\npipeline via civilian investments in ODM/UAM and military investments in\nRPV\xe2\x80\x99s, AAV\xe2\x80\x99s, UAV\xe2\x80\x99s, UTA\xe2\x80\x99s, UCAV\xe2\x80\x99s, MAV\xe2\x80\x99s, Drones, UAS etc. Such\nautonomous operation could provide vastly improved safety, as the preponderance\n(70 percent to 80 percent) of air transport accidents have historically been due to\nhuman error [Ref. 14]. In addition, it makes personal air vehicle transportation\navailable to the general public, as opposed to the few who have the opportunity,\nwealth, and physical characteristics and health to become pilots, as well as\nreducing the unit cost by an order of magnitude or more due to the concomitant\nvast increases in production rate and market. To be competitive with the\nautomobile, a personal VTOL converticar, PAV, should have an acquisition cost in\nthe vicinity of a quality automobile or less. Although in terms of the current main\nline helicopter industry, this is a ridiculous target. The advantages of a production\nrun of millions instead of hundreds and printing; along with the current offerings of\na single seat helo for $30K and a two\xe2\x80\x90seat gyroplane for $20K, all at small\nproduction runs, makes the outlook to achieve such a goal possible, if not probable.\nThe current ODM/UAM efforts could be greatly leveraged for PAV Application.\nAs near as possible to all\xe2\x80\x90weather operation is also a requirement, the same all\xe2\x80\x90\nweather capability or better, via flow control, one now has in an automobile, which\nis by no means absolute. Extremely heavy rain, extreme winds, ice and snow will\nall either slow or stop the auto, and similar restrictions will probably hold for the\nPAV although technologies to greatly improve the current aviation weather\nimpacts are certainly possible going forward via materials, flow control and AI.\nObviously, the evolving detect-and-avoid technology could be utilized, either on or\noff board, to increase safety vis\xe2\x80\x90a\xe2\x80\x90vis extreme weather. Over the years, particularly\nsince the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, there have been suggestions, and in some cases strident calls, for\n\n12\n\nthe development and mass marketing of personal aircraft. Although general\naviation has made considerable advances, the aircraft for the masses never really\ncaught on for a variety of reasons, mainly involving cost, lack of requisite\ntechnology readiness and an absolute requirement that the operator be a pilot, e.g.\nnon\xe2\x80\x90automatic operation. History is replete with examples of concepts which are\ngood ideas and which keep resurfacing until the technology base and market are\nready. Since the last personal aircraft campaign in the late 40\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9050\xe2\x80\x99s, major strides\nhave occurred in several enabling technologies. These include light weight,\nminiature, inexpensive and tremendously capable electronics and computing\nhardware, lightweight composite materials with nearly infinite fatigue life,\ncomputational fluid mechanics, smart-to\xe2\x80\x90brilliant materials and skins, flow control\nof several types, active controls and load alleviation, additive manufacturing, AI,\nand electric propulsion. Such advances significantly change the personal aircraft\nfeasibility discussion. There are several systems level issues and critical choices\nregarding the personal aircraft which serve as key discriminators in the selection of\na particular personal aircraft design. The first such issue is whether the personal\naircraft, either fixed or rotary wing, should be a separate air vehicle, or a\nconverticar, i.e., a combination automobile and air vehicle capable of economically\nperforming both missions.\nEconomics and utility strongly favor the converticar option. There are numerous\nelements common to both the air and ground vehicles, such as passenger\ncompartments, electric motors, etc. Therefore, since it is technically feasible to\nreduce the weight of an auto to what is reasonable for an air vehicle, a single\nvehicle should be considerably more economical in terms of initial cost and\nmaintenance than buying and maintaining two separate vehicles. Simple estimates\nof the flight\xe2\x80\x90specific component weights indicate a value of less than 1000 pounds,\nand therefore with shared utilization of common systems, the all\xe2\x80\x90up weight of the\nconverticar could be in the reasonable range of 3000 pounds or less. From an\noperational viewpoint a single vehicle should be much more convenient, obviating\nthe need for a rent\xe2\x80\x90a\xe2\x80\x90car in the vicinity of one\xe2\x80\x99s destination. Once the converticar\noption is selected, some decision has to be made regarding the provision for the\nair\xe2\x80\x90unique components, particularly the lift\xe2\x80\x90producing surfaces which require, for\nreasonable levels of drag\xe2\x80\x90due\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90lift, non\xe2\x80\x90trivial span and aspect ratio. Options\ninclude towed trailored wings utilized in early versions of the converticar, fixed\nwings of inherently low aspect ratio for roadability, airport rent\xe2\x80\x90a\xe2\x80\x90wing\nconcessions where the wings are attached prior to, and removed at the conclusion\nof flight and telescoping or folding wings. The present author favors the\ntelescoping or folding option as offering the best compromise between\nconvenience and performance. The next critical choice is between conventional\n\n13\n\nfixed wing operation and a rotary wing device or compound machine. VTOL or\nSuper STOL option would allow development and usage of currently undeveloped\nnations or regions at a fraction of the cost of the roads and bridges usually required\nfor such development, and at much less disruption to the environment. To avoid\nthe swarm problem the vehicle would probably be constrained to operate in the\nground vehicle mode in currently highly congested areas and only allowed to go\nairborne in lower population density areas unless they are over\xe2\x80\x90flying. Eventually\nsuch a vehicle could change current land use patterns and allow reduced population\ndensity, with an effect on the current built\xe2\x80\x90up suburbs similar to that of the\nautomobile upon the central cities.\nSimilarities between the horse\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90auto transition and potential auto\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90PAV include\noccurrence in the early part of the century (~ 100 years apart), both provoke major\nchanges in land use and ecology, lead to atrophy of concentrated population\ncenters, revolutionize the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy and builds upon nation\xe2\x80\x99s technological\nstrengths, and have an equivalent percentage increase in speed and personal action\nradius or freedom of action and privacy. Differences between the two are\nfavorable to the converticar, which should enhance safety and for which the\ninfrastructure is largely in place. We do not have to clear and pave the watershed\nat prodigious cost, as required by the auto. The safety issue for the converticar can\nbe approached via autonomous operation and a combination of vehicle parachutes\nand energy absorbing, crash worthy structural material design. It is not clear\nwhether such a vehicle would make sense economically, technically and society\xe2\x80\x90\nwise for those areas, such as parts of Europe, which are densely populated, and for\nthat portion of the human race who prefer to live in crowded conditions. The IT\ntelepresence revolution appears to be removing much of the economic rationale for\nsuch population concentration. Particularly enticing converticar markets include\nplaces with few intercity roads such as island nations Indonesia and Malaysia,\nSiberia, Northern Canada, Parts of Africa and Alaska. These machines will and in\nfact are being developed because the technologies are now ready, we can now do\nthis, for cost avoidance in terms of infrastructure, because the telepresence\nemerging lifestyle requires such connectivity. The carnage on the roadways and\nincreasing auto trip times and aggravation and the huge markets, extremely\ninteresting business cases makes this potential future possible. Congress in the\nU.S. has allowed access into the NAS for UAS making the likelihood of PAV,\nUAS carrying passengers, access into the NAS likely in the near future.\nThe current ODM and UAM efforts are investigating, building and flying\nprototypes of alternative approaches to the VTOL needed for urban, focused\nODM/UAM. With electric propulsion, distributed propulsion and flow control the\n\n14\n\nliterature is rife with large numbers of non-helo VTOL devices and approaches\nwith several to many lift fans. The many issues and drawbacks of helo approaches\nare well known and documented. These newer, evolving VTOL approaches are an\nadvance over helos, with some utilizing tilting components and utilizing some of\nthe fans for cruise propulsion. Typical benefits include lower noise, drag,\nvibration, cost, maintenance, and greater safety. As the costs of renewables for\nelectrical generation continue to drop and the batteries continue to improve, it is\nincreasingly feasible to unload the lift fans for improved acoustics. Not yet\nevidently seriously considered for ODM/UAM or PAV for VTOL operation is a\nstacked, stopped rotor for efficient cruise lift fan. This could possibly reduce drag\ndue to lift via a biplane effect, with the stacked, stopped rotors distributing the lift\nin the vertical direction. For super STOL operation there is the channel wing with\ncirculation control, and for lower cruise speed STOL various flavors of auto gyro.\nFor PAV, electric propulsion eliminates engine exhaust noise, enables\ndistributed propulsion and flow control and lighter engines, along with many more\nof the many benefits of electrics stated earlier.\nAnother serious metric for PAV, UAS and ODM is safety. In particular,\nscheduled airlines are a very well developed system, have a very low accident rate.\nIf that low accident rate is applied to the number of PAV, UAS and ODM vehicles,\nan increase in number from thousands to millions, there will obviously be many\nmore crashes. If now we discount the increase in the crash rate from scheduled\nairline experience for vehicles which may not have the same extreme design and\nmaintenance and regulation lavished upon commercial transports to the PAV,\nUAS, and ODM vehicles then even more crashes would be expected. Therefore\nsome means of economically ensuring functional crash proof operation for such\nvehicles needs to be developed. There are two obvious mitigation approaches to\nconditions which could result in a crash, either somehow enable the vehicle to keep\nflying or enable a successful landing that is not a crash. To keep flying or even to\nland successfully in a suitable location requires thrust and controllability. So some\nredundancies would need to be included in the vehicle designs. The current\napproach involves the historical solution space of using a parachute for the vehicle,\nwhich does not provide thrust, but does supply the other functionalities of drag,\nspeed reduction and controllability and provides a modicum of capability to keep\nflying, for some period of time, along with reducing impact velocity.\nThe ATC system required for the anticipated huge growth in the number of\nsmallish flying things, well into the many millions from the thousands, will have to\nbe quite different. To avoid the cost and latency of human controllers and provide\n\n15\n\nthe requisite raw capacity, it will have to become autonomous, and going forward\nit will control autonomous aircraft. The system will probably initially be\ndeveloped as a simulation to check out all the component parts and their system of\nsystems interactions, using data from, but not interacting with, the existing ATC\nsystem. The simulation could then be utilized to run a physical test out in\ncontrolled airspace and after such successful demonstrations the simulation\nhardware becomes the ATC system. The existing system must work constantly, as\nsuch trying to do a massive change to it is not really feasible. An entirely new\nsystem must be developed. Such a new, autonomous ATC system is essential\ngoing forward to enable PAV. The simulation would be utilized to develop and\nprove out and incorporate into a usable system the critical components.\nCommunications, sensors, actuators, navigation, software, computers, AI,\narchitectures, and redundant capabilities will be necessary to ensure resilience in\nthe face of weather and equipage malfunctions of both ATC and vehicles. The\nNASA Smart NAS approach is a start on such a simulation.\nElectric Long Haul Transports \xe2\x80\x93 A truss braced wing design is proffered an\nexample of what may be possible for an electric long haul aircraft design [ref 15],\nuse of an external wing truss provides major structural benefits, and allows\nreduced wing weight, thickness and sweep, resulting in a tremendously enhanced\nand easily maintained, with reduced sensitivity to roughness, insect remains, ice\nclouds, and reduced cross flow extent of natural\xe2\x80\x90to\xe2\x80\x90easily forced low drag laminar\nflow, along with increased span. The latter allows a reduction in wing chord,\nfurther enhancing the extent of laminar flow, as well as a reduced vortex hazard.\nPlenninger\xe2\x80\x99s designs for such aircraft yielded L/D values in the 40\xe2\x80\x99s, over twice\ncurrent levels with one of his studies which included a laminar fuselage yielding a\nmachine with L/D = 100, 700 Pax and 200,000 Km range. The concept was not,\nhowever, adopted primarily because the extensive wing span did not fit the FAA\n80-meter box requirement for airport gate compatibility, and the disbelief that a\ntransonic strut or truss braced wing could be designed with acceptable shock drag\nand obtain laminar flow on the strut or truss. Obviously strut\xe2\x80\x90bracing is routinely\nemployed on lower speed aircraft. The latter objection is probably not valid in\nlight of today\xe2\x80\x99s CFD capabilities. In general, we build what we can compute and\nwe have been too long constrained in aircraft design to linear theory and the\nconsequence is linear thinking. Indeed, lack of adequate or believable first\nprinciples estimation methods for not only performance but cost, maintenance and\noperability, etc. are a major reason why work on advanced aero concepts has\nlagged. Much of our current systems methodologies are essentially extrapolation\nand interpolation procedures based upon, and therefore largely restricted to,\nempirical data from the current paradigms. Improved computing machine\n\n16\n\ncapabilities and mod\xe2\x80\x90sim developments are changing such considerations and\njudgements in real time. The span of a truss\xe2\x80\x90braced configuration can probably be\ndoubled and a hinge already studied and applied in industry could be utilized to\nconform to the 80-meter gate requirement. Doubling the span would halve\nReynolds number on the wing and reduce drag due to lift on the order of 75%.\nCombining this DDL reduction with the extensive wing laminar flow results in\nmost of the remaining vehicle drag being fuselage friction drag. Such drag can be\naddressed in several ways. The most dramatic is to apply boundary layer\nrelaminarization just downstream of the cockpit or forward door. The aircraft nose\nregion with the radome, probes, windshield, wipers etc. will be turbulent, and\ntherefore need to ingest or take aboard greater than 150% to entrain the turbulent\nsuperlayer of the local fuselage turbulent boundary layer and reestablish laminar\nflow. The increasing use of personal view screens versus windows greatly eases\nthe task of maintaining laminar flow downstream. The air taken aboard can be slot\ninjected into the wing\xe2\x80\x90fuselage turbulent flow wedge to accrue local skin friction\nreduction. The electric motors can be moved to the rear of the fuselage,\nsurrounded by a Goldschmied shroud. This would enable several interesting and\nuseful functionalities. The propulsion exhaust flow could be thrust\xe2\x80\x90vectored,\nobviating the weight and drag of the empannage. The shroud provides copious\nvolume for acoustic treatments. The propulsion system ingests the fuselage\nboundary layer accruing a sizable propulsion improvement. Then there is the oft\nmentioned but still under study Goldschmied effect [ref 16] that purportedly could\ncancel a sizable portion of the fuselage friction drag. The thought is that possibly\nputting sinks inside the body using the cowl could convert the back of the cowl\ninto a stagnation region, thereby producing what Goldschmied called favorable\ninteraction static pressure thrust.\nThe gear weight could be reduced in several ways. One is to utilize parachutes\ninstead of super heavy brakes for refused takeoff. Another is to utilize wholly\nautonomous landings with the controls slaved to the altitude or ground proximity\nand decent rate to take out the impact loading. Yet another is to employ imbedded\nhydraulics in the gear structure to provide rigidity only when needed versus\ncarrying the weight throughout the mission. All of these benefits reduce overall\nvehicle weight, which along with clever vortex flow control can reduce the wake\nvortex hazard. The advanced materials mentioned previously could be applied,\nfurther reducing dry weight. The computed L/D for these configurations is in\nexcess of 40 or higher, vice the current values the order of 20 or less. It should be\nnoted that we have no detailed studies of truss braced wing truss optimization. The\nstudies thus far have been at the systems, not the detailed design level. We have\nnever been here before. Obvious options include pre\xe2\x80\x90stressing, hydraulic dynamic\ninternal pressurization, laminar elements, arching, Y-intersections with the wing to\n\n17\n\navoid supercritical flow regions, optimizing the overall number, nature, positioning\nof the elements, etc. The truss could be carried out beyond the wing hinge\nposition; all of these options and far more are forward work.\nElectric Supersonic Transports \xe2\x80\x93 Electrics for SSTs is a major enabler. They\nfly above the tropopause where, even using bio or hydrogen fuels, the water in the\nexhaust is a major climate problem, in fact is thought to be more serious such than\nCO2. The only realistic way to solve emissions for SSTs is to go fully electric.\nAlso, the increased efficiencies enabled by electric propulsion could provide the\nrequisite solid economic case, especially when compounded by the several other\nconcomitant breakthroughs, including materials, manufacturing, and supersonic\nthrough-flow fans. Compared to existing SST aero designs, with an L/D in the 10\nrange, a strut braced extreme arrow configuration could provide the order of 16\nL/D.\nThus far SST\xe2\x80\x99s have not been particularly successful, either conceptually or in\nactual realizations. The Concord was a technological marvel for its time but not\ncommercially successful. Similar remarks hold for the TU\xe2\x80\x90144. The basic SST\nissues are confounded by the addition of serious wave drag, higher fuel fractions,\nhigher temperatures, and greater weights, all driving up vehicle cost. Then there\nare the high-altitude emissions problems, far more incident radiation, and the sonic\nboom, the latter causing anti\xe2\x80\x90SST legislation. The sonic boom affects both people\nand things. There has been success in reducing the N\xe2\x80\x90wave peaks that affect\npeople but reducing the low frequency rumble that affects buildings, etc. is a much\nmore difficult task. Taken together, the various and in some instances rather\nextensive studies over the years since Concord of SST potential viability,\nespecially economic viability, have not been optimistic. There are concentrated\nstudies ongoing of SST Business jets as such smaller vehicles both reduce the\nmassive investment level required to field such machines and also reduce the sonic\nboom, which is first order dependent upon weight. Advanced Configuration SSTs\ncome in five major categories, unswept, thin natural laminar flow wings, parasol\nwing with favorable interference, multi stage aircraft, yawed wings and the\nPfenninger extreme arrow strut braced wing [ref 17]. The multi\xe2\x80\x90stage approach\nusually involves a stage which includes the capability to get off the ground with\nacceptable noise and high lift and then separates and returns to the airfield. The\nportion of the aircraft that lands at the end of the flight weighs far less, allowing\ncarriage of lighter weight gear and high lift systems. In\xe2\x80\x90flight refueling is another\nmulti\xe2\x80\x90stage aircraft option. The yawed wing approach uniquely provides a low\nsupersonic Mach number option that is nearly boomless and extremely efficient.\nOf these, the Pfenninger extreme arrow strut braced wing appears to have the\n\n18\n\ngreatest SST potential, essentially doubling the Concord L/D of 7.3ish. The best\nNASA did in the HSCT/HSR program of the late 90\xe2\x80\x99s was an L/D in the range of\n9.5. The Pfenninger designs proffer values in the range of 14 to 16 plus. The\nextreme arrow wing minimizes wave drag due to lift and wing wetted area as well\nas providing a credible span for vortex drag minimization. The short wing chord\naids suction laminar flow control. There are mid\xe2\x80\x90wing fuel canisters for favorable\nwave interaction and load alleviation with the possibility of natural laminar flow\non the forward regions of the fuel canisters and the fuselage. Several approaches\nutilized to optimize the truss braced CTOL design can also be applied to this SST\nincluding gear weight reductions via automatic landings and parachutes for refused\ntakeoff and C\xe2\x80\x90Wing tips to reduce DDL. The serious takeoff jet noise issue can be\naddressed via an essentially new approach by disabling or reducing the causative\nturbulence dynamics versus reducing the jet velocity via entrainment using heavy\nmixer-ejectors. Experiments and some theory indicates that the injection of liquid\nwater jets, suitably tailored for effectiveness and minimal water mass flow can\nplace water droplets in the mixing region of the external jet which reduces\nturbulence intensity and noise. The water injection produces additional thrust\nversus the mixer\xe2\x80\x90ejectors that reduce thrust and is a way of staging the aircraft, the\nwater is only utilized during takeoff, and does not have to be carried throughout the\nflight as does the mixer\xe2\x80\x90ejector. Having such a high L/D provides the margins\nnecessary to address the myriad SST problems. Probably next\xe2\x80\x90in\xe2\x80\x90line in terms of\nefficient SST configuration approaches would be the oblique or yawed wing and\nwork on a bi\xe2\x80\x90directional flying wing concept and the NASA N+3 SST studies. The\nformer is due to R.T. Jones and is well discussed in the literature. The bi\xe2\x80\x90\ndirectional approach is circa 2011 [ref 18] and involves a design based upon 90degree rotation of the configuration for supersonic versus subsonic flight. The\ndesign thereby provides major alterations in aspect ratio for each speed range,\nenabling true bi\xe2\x80\x90modal performance with excellent aero performance for both\nsupersonic over water and subsonic over land. The overall approach is similar in\nphilosophy to the variable sweep and yawed designs, but executed in a wholly\nnovel fashion, with efficacy still to be determined. Such bi\xe2\x80\x90modal aero\nperformance improves the overall performance for the mission and reduces\nrequired energy.\nElectric propulsion for SST\xe2\x80\x99s could involve a quite different approach from that for\nfueled aircraft. Instead of a combustor and a turbine to drive axial flow\ncompressors, very light weight, very efficient electric motors would drive them.\nThe initial stages of compression could involve supersonic through flows. Rather\nthan combustion providing the cycle enthalpy increase, batteries would provide\nsuch, primarily as compression, with thrust produced via subsequent flow\nexpansion out the nozzle. Such engines should be more efficient than GTEs, with\n\n19\n\nmany other benefits as discussed previously. To further increase efficiency the heat\nproduced by the compression, the stagnation of the supersonic free stream and the\nmotors could be regenerated and used to produce additional electricity to propel\nthe aircraft. There are a plethora of extant energy conversion approaches to enable\nthis including thermal electrics, pyroelectrics, sterling cycle heat engines, etc. It\nalso may be possible to efficiently radiate heat from the wing surface to cold space\nvia specific wavelengths [ref. 19].\nElectric propulsion for SSTs is in an early research stage, with ideation, and R&D\noptimization required especially for such as propulsion cycles, boundary layer\ncontrol, including shock-boundary interactions to increase compressor stage\nloading and to obtain favorable shock wave interference, minimization of shock\nlosses in the inlet and compressor stages, along with further work on supersonic\nthrough flow fans and possibly morphing blades. A selected precis of research\nopportunities includes the revolutionary materials, e.g. the 5X, 1300 C MIT\nmaterials, which would both reduce the requisite cooling and weight. The\ncombination of greatly improved materials and aero performance, coupled with\nelectric propulsion could conceivably successfully address all of the extant major\nSST issues, emissions, efficiency, cost, and due to the resultant battery weight and\ndry weight reductions even sonic boom.\nConcluding Remarks\nAs is the case with the current acceleration of renewable energy\ndevelopment, the combination of cost reductions, and serious climate impacts is an\naccelerator for electric transportation writ large, including electric aircraft across\nthe speed range. There are a plethora, cited herein, of very sizable cost and\noperational benefits which accrue from switching to electric propulsion for air\ntravel. The emission benefits include obviation of water addition above the\ntroposphere, the most serious current aircraft emission with respect to climate\nimpacts, along with eliminating CO2 and NOx. Given the rapid development of\nrenewable energy to recharge the batteries, electric aircraft would be increasingly\nemission-less. The single most serious impediment to electric aircraft development\nis the energy density of batteries. Recent research indicate the potential for 750\nrecharges and 15 times lithium ion battery energy density for lithium air batteries.\nAlso, there is the announcement of a 500 Wh/kg lithium-metal battery on the\nmarket in the nearer future. This research has, advanced to the point where, at the\nsystem level, parity with combustion engines coupled through mechanical drive\ntrains can conceivably be achieved over the next decade.\n\n20\n\nContained herein, are a large number of approaches to reduce energy\nrequirements and battery weight by reducing aircraft empty weight and reducing\ndrag. Revolutionary aircraft concepts, configurations and technologies would\nmake electric aircraft even more feasible and desirable and their development\nenabled sooner.\nOverall, gas turbine engines, heavy transportation fuels may be approaching\na pivotal game changing moment in their history, enabling in the process the\nUAS/ODM/UAM/PAV revolution in human and material transportation, this time\non the personal level, as well as enabling viable SSTs, while also greatly reducing\nthe climate impact of aviation...\n\nReferences\n1.

SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES\n14. ABSTRACT\n\nClimate concerns have instigated serious research for weight critical batteries to enable what are termed EVs, electric vehicles, initially for ground\ntransportation. This research has now advanced to produce lithium air batteries, which are essentially at chemical energy density, with thus far 750recharge capability. Concomitantly, renewable electric generation, which would enable essentially emission-less EVs, has via cost reductions, efficiency\nimprovements and storage research advanced to producing some 25% of electrical generation and some 62% of new generation capability. The present\nreport examines the resultant electric aircraft possibilities, opportunities across the speed range including the many , besides emissions reduction,\nbenefits of electric propulsion and the enablement of a new massive Aero market for affordable, safe personal air vehicles that operate off of local\nstreets.\n15.
