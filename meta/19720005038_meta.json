The calculations are based on a cascade model which was first adjusted until it agreed with measurements made with protons at an accelerator. Modifications of the model used for protons include the incorporation of the probabilities for fragmentation of heavy nuclei into lighter nuclei, alpha particles, and nucleons. Mean values and fluctuations of the equivalent numbers of particles in the cascades at various depths in an iron absorber are presented for protons, carbon, and iron nuclei over the 30 to 300 GeV/nucleon energy range.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720005038, "id": "4795cf98c27a4b54aa1d4c29536e43b7", "publicationDate": "1971-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720005038.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720005038/downloads/19720005038.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720005038/downloads/19720005038.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720005038/downloads/19720005038.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
