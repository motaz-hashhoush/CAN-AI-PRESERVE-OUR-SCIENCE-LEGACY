b'Active Debris Removal\nOrbital debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is an international problem that threatens\nthe success of future space ventures. An analysis of a wide variety of alternative\nsolutions for active debris removal (ADR) has been performed. The solution\nselected is an efficient, effective, and executable solution to remove large debris\nin LEO, primarily spent rocket bodies. Removing large debris objects is a critical\nstep in reducing the hazard from orbital debris, because of the large amount of\nmedium and small debris created through large body collisions.\nBased on the analysis of alternatives, the concept and design for a vehicle which\ncould efficiently address the debris hazard by disposing of several large objects\nper mission has been developed. This concept establishes a comprehensive,\ndetailed technical approach for an actual end-to-end, on-orbit ADR solution to\nremove large debris. This robust solution enables the start of solving the\nproblem of debris removal before it reaches a critical and potentially irreversible\nstate by \xe2\x80\x9cgetting there as soon as possible, as economically as possible, with the\nmost capability\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n'
