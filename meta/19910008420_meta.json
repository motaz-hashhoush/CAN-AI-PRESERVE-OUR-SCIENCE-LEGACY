Although based on a cubic grid structure, NASCAP/LEO accepts object definition input from standard computer aided design (CAD) programs so that a model may be correctly proportioned and important features resolved. The potential around the model is calculated by solving the finite element formulation of Poisson's equation with an analytic space charge function. Five previously published NASCAP/LEO calculations for three ground test experiments and two space flight experiments are presented. The three ground test experiments are a large simulated panel, a simulated pinhole, and a 2-slit experiment with overlapping sheaths. The two space flight experiments are a solar panel biased up to 1000 volts, and a rocket-mounted sphere biased up to 46 kilovolts. In all cases, the authors find good agreement between calculation and measurement.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008420, "id": "b51d3234535f4822b571abb506eeef55", "publicationName": "NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, Current Collection from Space Plasmas", "publicationDate": "1990-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19910008400, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Current Collection from Space Plasmas", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008420.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008420/downloads/19910008420.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008420/downloads/19910008420.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008420/downloads/19910008420.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
