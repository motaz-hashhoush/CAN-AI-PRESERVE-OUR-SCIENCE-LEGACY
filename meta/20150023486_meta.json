This can be explained by two reasons: first, a very large number of unconstrained parameters are involved in accurate parameterizations, and second, a detailed description of semi-volatile organics is computationally very expensive. Even organic aerosol properties that are known to play a major role in the atmosphere, namely volatility and aging, are poorly resolved in global models, if at all. Studies with different models and different parameterizations have not been conclusive on whether the additional complexity improves model simulations, but the added diversity of the different host models used adds an unnecessary degree of variability in the evaluation of results that obscures solid conclusions. Aerosol microphysics do not significantly alter the mean OA vertical profile or comparison with surface measurements. This might not be the case for semi-volatile OA with microphysics.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150023486, "endDate": "2015-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "California Univ.", "location": "Davis, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "43059735b7ff497c826f663f31a2cad9", "id": "ffb294a5b9fe4577b183ecac3cfbc352"}], "name": "IAMA CONFERENCE 2015", "location": "Davis, CA", "id": "43059735b7ff497c826f663f31a2cad9", "startDate": "2015-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150023486, "id": "956a106541734ed0913c4d1ecb1e0da2", "publicationDate": "2015-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150023486.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150023486/downloads/20150023486.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150023486/downloads/20150023486.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150023486/downloads/20150023486.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
