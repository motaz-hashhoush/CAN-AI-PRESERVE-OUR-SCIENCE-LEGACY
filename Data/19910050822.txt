International alliances will result in a more rapid diffusion of\ntechnology, increasing pressure on U.S. aerospace companies to push forward with new\ntechnological developments and to take steps that maximize the inclusion of those\ntechnological developments into the research and development (R&D) process.\nTo remain a world leader in aerospace, the United States must improve and maintain\nthe professional competency of its aerospace engineers and scientists, enhance\ninnovation and productivity, and maximize the integration of recent technology into\nthe R&D process. How well these objectives are met, and at what cost, depends on.\na variety of factors, but largely on the ability of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists\nto acquire and process the results of NASA! DoD funded R&D.\nThese circumstances emphasize the need to understand the aerospace knowledge\ndiffusion process with respect to federally funded R&D; to recognize that STI emanating\nfrom federally funded aerospace R&D is a valuable strategic resource for innovation,\n\n* Direct all correspondence to: Tho,nas \xc2\xa3 Pinelli, NASA Langley Research Center, MS 180A, Hampton,\nVirginia 23665-5225.\n\nGovernment Information Quarterly, Volume 8, Number 2, pages 219-233\nISSN: 0740-624X\n\n220\t\n\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 8/No. 2/1991\n\nproblem solving, and productivity; and to remove the major barriers that restrict or\nprohibit the ability of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists to acquire and process\nthe results of federally funded aerospace R&D. However, as Solomon and Tornatsky\npoint out, "while STI, its transfer and utilization, is crucial to innovation [and\ncompetitiveness], linkages between [the] various sectors of the technology infrastructure\nare weak and/or poor defined."3\nThe conditions also intensify the need to understand the production, transfer, and\nutilization of knowledge as a precursor to the rapid diffusion of aerospace technology\nand as a means of maximizing the aerospace R&D process. Maximizing the aerospace\nR&D process begins with an understanding of the information-seeking habits and\npractices of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists. As Menzel states,\nThe way in which (aerospace] engineers and scientists make use of the information\nsystems at their disposal, the demands that they put on them, the satisfaction\nachieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their future work are among\nthe items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise planning of S&T information\nsystems and policy.4\n\nThe ability of aerospace engineers and scientists to identify, acquire, and utilize\nscientific and technical information (STI) is of paramount importance to the efficiency\nof the R&D process. Testimony to the central role of STI in the R&D process is found\nin numerous studies. 5 These studies show, among other things, that aerospace engineers\nand scientists devote more time, on the average, to the communication of technical\ninformation than to any other scientific or technical activity. 6 A number of studies have\nfound strong relationships between the communications of STI and technical\nperformance at both the individual 7\'8\'9 and group levels.\' 0" 1" 2 The "role of scientific\nand technical communication is thus central to the success of the innovation process,\nin general, and the management of R&D activities, in particular." 13\nIn terms of empirically derived data, very little is known about the diffusion of\nknowledge in the aerospace industry, both in terms of the channels used to communicate\nthe ideas and the information-gathering habits and practices of the members of the\nsocial system (i.e., aerospace engineers and scientists). Most of the channel studies have\nbeen concerned with the transfer of aerospace technology to non-aerospace\nindustries.\'4"5\nMost of the studies involving aerospace engineers and scientists have been limited\nto the use of NASA STI products and services and have not been concerned with\ninformation-gathering habits and practices.\' 6"7 Although researchers have investigated\nthe importance of technical communications to engineers, it is not impossible to\ndetermine from the published results if the study participants included aerospace\nengineers and scientists.\' 8"9 An understanding of the process by which STI in the\naerospace industry is communicated through certain channels over time among the\nmembers of the social system would contribute to increasing productivity, stimulating\ninnovation, and improving and maintaining the professional competence of U.S.\naerospace engineers and scientists.\n\nThe NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project \t\n\n221\n\nTHE FEDERAL AEROSPACE KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION PROCESS\n\nA model (Figure 1) that depicts the transfer of federally funded aerospace R&D is\ncomposed of two parts\xe2\x80\x94the informal that relies on collegial contacts and the\nformal\nthat relies on surrogates, information products, and information intermediaries to\ncomplete the "producer to user" transfer process. The producers are NASA and the\nDoD and their contractors and grantees. Producers depend upon surrogates and\ninformation intermediaries to complete the knowledge transfer process.\nWhen U.S. government technical reports are published, the initial or primary\ndistribution is made to libraries and technical information centers. Copies are sent to\nsurrogates for secondary and subsequent distribution. A limited number are set aside\nto be used by the author for the "scientist-to-scientist" exchange of information at the\nindividual level.\nSurrogates serve as technical report repositories or clearinghouses for the producers\nand include the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), the NASA Scientific\nand Technical Information Facility (NASA STIF), and the National Technical\nInformation Service (NTIS). These surrogates have created a variety of technical report\nannouncement journals such as TRAC (Technical Report Announcement Circular) and\nSTAR (Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports) and computerized retrieval systems\nsuch as DROLS (Defense RDT&E Online System) and RECON (REmote CONsole)\nthat permit online access to technical report databases.\nInformation intermediaries are, in large part, librarians and technical information\nspecialists in academia, government, and industry. Those representing the producers\nserve as what McGowan and Loveless 20 describe as "knowledge brokers" or "linking\nagents." Information intermediaries connected with users act as "technological\nentrepreneurs" or "gatekeepers." 2 \' The more "active" the intermediary, the more\neffective the transfer process becomes. 22 Active intermediaries take information from\none place and move it to another, often face-to-face.

Ample evidence\nsupports the claim that no one researcher can know about or keep up with all the\nresearch in his! her area(s) of interest. Like other members of the scientific community,\naerospace engineers and scientists are faced with the problem of too much information\nto know about, to keep up with, and to screen\xe2\x80\x94information that is becoming more\ninterdisciplinary in nature and more international in scope.\nTwo problems exist with the formal part of the system. First, the formal part of the\nsystem employs one-way "supply side" transfer procedures that do not seem to be\nresponsive to the user context. 26 Rather, these efforts appear to start with an information\nsystem into which the users\' requirements are retrofit.27 The consensus of the findings\nfrom the empirical research is that interactive, two-way communications are required\nfor effective information transfer.28\nSecond, the formal part relies heavily on information intermediaries to complete the\nknowledge transfer process. However, a strong methodological base for measuring or\nassessing the effectiveness of the information intermediary is lacking. 29 In addition,\nempirical findings on the effectiveness of information intermediaries and the role(s) they\nplay in knowledge transfer are sparse and inconclusive. The impact of information\nintermediaries is likely to be strongly conditional and limited to a specific institutional\ncontext.\nFurthermore, most Federal approaches to research utilization have been ineffective\nin stimulating the diffusion of technological innovation. 30 According to Roberts and\nFrohman, numerous Federal STI programs are "highest in frequency and expense yet\nlowest in impact" and that Federal "information dissemination activities have led to\nlittle documented research utilization." Roberts and Frohman note that "governmental\nprograms start to encourage utilization of research only after the R&D results have\nbeen generated" rather than during the idea development phase of the innovation\nprocess.\nNASA/DoD AEROSPACE KNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION RESEARCH PROJECT\n\nThis cooperative effort is sponsored by NASA, Code RF and Code NTT, and the DoD,\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Deputy for Scientific and Technical\nInformation. The research project is a joint effort of Indiana University\'s Center for\n\nThe NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project\t\n\n223\n\nSurvey Research and the NASA Langley Research Center. As scholarly inquiry, the\nproject has both an immediate and a long-term purpose. In the first instance, it provides\na practical and pragmatic basis for understanding how the results of NASA! DoD\nresearch diffuse into the aerospace R&D process. Over the long term, it provides an\nempirical basis for understanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process itself and\nits implications at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels.\nDespite the vast amount of scientific and technical information (STI) available to\npotential users, several major barriers to effective knowledge diffusion exist. 3 \' First, the\nvery low level of support for knowledge transfer in comparison to knowledge production\nsuggests that dissemination efforts are not viewed as an important component of the R&D\nprocess. Second, there are mounting reports from users about difficulties in getting\nappropriate information in forms useful for problem solving and decision making. Third,\nrapid advances in many areas of S&T knowledge can be fully exploited only if they are\nquickly translated into further research and application. Although the United States\ndominates basic R&D, foreign competitors may be better able to apply the results. Fourth,\ncurrent mechanisms are often inadequate to help the user assess the quality of available\ninformation. Filth, the characteristics of actual usage behavior are not sufficiently taken\ninto account in making available useful and easily retrieved information.\nThese deficiencies must be remedied if the results of NASA! DoD funded R&D are\nto be successfully applied to innovation, problem-solving, and productivity. Only by\nmaximizing the R&D process can the United States maintain its international\ncompetitive edge in aerospace. The NASAl DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion\nResearch Project will provide descriptive and analytical data regarding the flow of STI\nat the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. It will examine both\nthe channels used to communicate information and the social system of the aerospace\nknowledge diffusion process. The results of the project should provide useful\ninformation to R&D managers, information managers, and others concerned with\nimproving access to and utilization of STI.\nProject Assumptions\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rapid diffusion of technology and technological developments requires an\nunderstanding of the aerospace knowledge diffusion process;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Knowledge production, transfer, and utilization are equally important\ncomponents of the aerospace knowledge diffusion process;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding the channels; the information products involved in the production,\ntransfer, and utilization of aerospace information; and the information-seeking\nhabits, practices, and preferences of aerospace engineers and scientists are\nnecessary to understand aerospace knowledge diffusion;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The knowledge derived from federally funded aerospace R&D is indispensable\nin maintaining the vitality and international competitiveness of the U.S. aerospace\nindustry and essential to maintaining and improving the professional competency\nof U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The U.S. government technical report plays an important, but as yet undefined,\nrole in the transfer and utilization of knowledge derived from federally funded\naerospace R&D; and\n\n224\n\n\t\n\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 8/No. 2/I 99\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Librarians, as information intermediaries, play an important, but as yet\nundefined, role in the transfer and utilization of knowledge derived from federally\nfunded aerospace R&D.\nProject Objectives\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the individual,\norganizational, and national levels, placing particular emphasis on the diffusion\nof federally funded aerospace ST1;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding the international aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the\nindividual and organizational levels, placing particular emphasis on the systems\nused to diffuse the results of government funded aerospace STI;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding the roles played by the NASA!

As scholarly inquiry, the project has\nboth an immediate and a long-term purpose. In the first instance, it provides a pragmatic\nbasis for understanding how the results of NASA! DoD research diffuse into the\naerospace R&D process. Over the long term, the project will provide an empirical basis\nfor understanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the individual,\norganizational, national, and international levels. An outline of the descriptive portion\nof the project is contained in Table 1 as "A Five Year Program of Research on Aerospace\nKnowledge Diffusion."\nPhase 1 of the 4-phase project is concerned with the information-seeking habits and\npractices of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists, with particular emphasis being\nplaced on their use of federally funded aerospace STI products and services. A number\nof studies have indicated that researchers\' information input and output activities are\nrelated or, at least, associated. Their communication behavior can be viewed as a system\nof information input and output activities and characterized as a series of complex\ninteractions affected by a variety of factors. These factors influence the use and\nproduction of information and can be used to understand and explain the use and\nproduction of information sources and products (e.g., NASA! DoD technical reports).\nThe conceptual model shown in Figure 2 assumes a consistent internal logic that\ngoverns the information-seeking and processing behavior of aerospace engineers and\nscientists despite any individual differences they may exhibit. This logic is the product\nof several interacting structural and sociometric factors, the purpose for which the\n\nThe NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project\n\n.2\n\n.\t\n\n0. !\n\n0\n\n.0 -\n\n.\n\na\n\n0.\n\n.\n\nV\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n.L.__\n\n.\t\n\ni 1. .11\n.\n\n-\n\n.\n\n-\t\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\na\n\nui\n\nV\n\'C\n\ncn\n\nI\n\n0.\n\n.2\n\n____\np\np\n\nG\n\nV\nCt-\n\nI\n\n2\n\n8\n\n0\nDO\n\nC\n\nh t\n\n0\n\nF\'\n\nifli\n\n\'6\nb0. -\n\n6.E\n\na\n\n1\n\n.\n\n.\n\na.\n\n.9\ng\n\n.0U\n\ng\nz\n.\n\n.5\np\n\nv\n\np\n\n____\xe2\x80\xa2\n\np\n\na)\np\n\np\t\n\np\n\n\xc2\xa3\np\n\np\n\np _____________\n\n0\n-c\nU\n5a)\n\'I.\'\na)\n\nI\nC.\t\n\n.\n\nC\n2\n\n.9\n\nC..\n\n0.\n\n.0\n\nbo\t\n\n0.\n\n.2\t\nC\n\nC\n\n.\n\n-\n\nI\n\n.-\t0 .

The model is shown as a flow chart consisting of several functions and actions,\nincluding an evaluation function and a reinforcement function that provide feedback.\nThe results of the Phase 1 pilot study indicate that U.S. aerospace engineers and\nscientists spend approximately 65 percent of a 40-hour work week communicating STI.\nThe types of information and the information products used and produced in\nperforming professional duties are similar, with basic STI and in-house technical data\nmost frequently reported. STI internal to the organizational is preferred over external\nSTI, which includes NASA! DoD technical reports, journal articles, and conferences!\nmeeting papers. Respondents identified informal channels and personalized sources as\nthe primary method of STI seeking, followed by the use of formal information sources,\nwhen solving technical problems. Only after completing an informal search, followed\nby using formal information sources, do they turn to librarians and technical\ninformation specialists for assistance.\nPhase 2 focuses on aerospace knowledge transfer and use within the larger social\nsystem, placing particular emphasis on the flow of aerospace STI in government and\nindustry and the role of the information intermediary (i.e., the aerospace librarian!\ntechnical information specialist) in knowledge transfer. In Phase 2, the process of\ninnovation in the U.S. aerospace industry is conceptualized as an information processing\nsystem which must deal with work-related uncertainty through patterns of technical\ncommunications.\nInformation processing in aerospace R&D (Figure 3) is viewed as an ongoing\nproblem-solving cycle involving each activity within the innovation process, the larger\norganization, and the external world. For purposes of this study, the innovation process\nis conceptualized as a process of related activities or units beginning with research on\none end and service and maintenance on the other.\n\nEXTERNAL INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT\nFederal - - Supply-Push\nGovernment\t\n\n__..TECHNOLOGlCAL\t\nINFORMA11ON P4FORMATJON \t\n\n-\n\nDemand-Pull .- - Federal\nGovernment\n\nThe Aerospace Organization\nA\t esearC\t\n\nDesign &\t\nh__j4Develo ent\t\n\nManulactunng\t\n& Production\t\n\nMarketing\t\n& Sales\t\n\nService &\nMaintenance\n\n--sy-1+-Technical Information Center.\n\nINTERNAL INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT\n\nFigure 3. The Aerospace Innovation Process as an Information Processing System\n\n228\t\n\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 8/No. 2/1991\n\nThese activities or units are highly differentiated, however. They operate on different\ntime frames, with different goals, and with varying professional orientations.32 These\ndifferences in norms and values also carry with them different internal coding schemes\nwhich suggest that each unit may possess specific and unique information requirements\nand information processing patterns. In addition, each unit is likely to have different\nsources of effective feedback, evaluation, and information support.33\nFor any given task, each activity or unit within the innovation process "must [based\non open system theory] effectively import technical and market information from the\nexternal information world." 34 New [external] and established [internal] information\nmust be effectively processed within the work area; decisions, solutions, and approaches\nmust be worked on and coordinated within each activity and within the organization;\nand outputs, such as decisions, processes, products, and information, must effectively\nbe transferred to the external environment. The outputs of this process create conditions\nfor another set of activities, thereby initiating another information processing cycle.\nThroughout the process, organizations must be sensitive to the differences between the\nactivities or units that comprise the innovation process. Specialized feedback,\nevaluation, and support may be required to process new information from internal and\nexternal sources.35\nIt is, however, the nature of organizations engaged in innovation to isolate themselves\nfrom the outside world, to erect barriers to communication with their external\nenvironment, and to rely on information internal to the organization. 36 This behavior\noccurs because of the need for organizations to exercise control over those situations\nin which they interact with the "outside" and to reduce uncertainty, and because these\norganizations are frequently involved in activities of a proprietary nature. 3738 Numerous\nstudies have found a strong relationship between successful innovation, idea\nformulation, and information external to the organization. 39\'40\'4 \' The danger, then, for\norganizations engaged in innovation is to become isolated from their external\nenvironment and from information external to the organization.42\nPhase 3 focuses on knowledge use and transfer at the individual and organizational\nlevels in the academic sector of the aerospace community. Faced with shrinking\nenrollments, particularly at the graduate level, university aerospace programs must find\nways to maintain the talent pooi that will advance aerospace technological development\nand guarantee U.S. competitiveness. To prepare future aerospace engineers and\nscientists, academic programs must have access to "state of the art" STI. Consequently,\nNASA and the DoD must ensure the effective and efficient delivery of federally- funded\naerospace STI. An understanding of individual information-seeking behavior, the flow\nof aerospace STI, and STI transfer system in academia should provide NASA! DoD\nwith important insights for program development.\nPhase 4 examines knowledge production, use, and transfer among non-U.S.\nindividuals and aerospace organizations, specifically in Western Europe and Japan. As\nU.S. collaboration with foreign aerospace technology producers increases, a more\ninternational manufacturing environment will arise, fostering an increased flow of U.S.\ntrade. At the same time, however, international industrial alliances will result in a more\nrapid diffusion of technology, prompting the U.S. aerospace industry to forge ahead\nwith new technological developments. To cooperate in joint ventures as well as to\ncompete successfully at the international level, U.S. aerospace industries will need to\n\nThe NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project\t\n\n229\n\ndevelop methods to collect, translate, analyze, and disseminate the best of foreign\naerospace STI. Therefore, an understanding of the process by which non-U.S. aerospace\nengineers and scientists communicate at the individual and organizational levels\nbecomes essential.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe President\'s Commission on Industrial Competitiveness concluded that "we must\nbe able to compete [internationally] if we are going to meet our national goals." 43 Since\n1965, however, seven of our ten U.S. high technology industries have lost world market\nshares. The major exception to this rule is the aerospace industry which continues\nto be the leading positive contributor to the United States balance of trade among all\nmerchandise industries.45\nIn his study of the commercial aviation sector of the aerospace industry, Mowery\nconcludes that R&D investment resulted in dramatic productivity increa^es. Mowery\nfurther states that "total factor productivity in this [commercial aviation sector) industry\nhas grown more rapidly than in virtually any other U.S. industry during the postwar\nperiod."46\nIndeed, the U.S. aerospace industry leads all other industries in expenditures for\nR&D. The National Science Foundation estimates that total R&D expenditures on\nU.S. aerospace projects reached $24 billion in I988. However, the U.S. aerospace\nindustry, in particular the commercial aviation sector, is in the midst of profound change\nand now faces a significantly more challenging competitive and global environment.48\nThe MIT Commission on Industrial Productivity reinforces this position, stating that\n"federal regulatory policy and foreign competition has dramatically altered the\nmarketplace for the U.S. commercial aviation sector."49\nNumerous factors contribute to the economic growth, prosperity, and performance\nof a nation. Studies performed by economists reveal that from 40 to 90 percent of the\nincrease in economic growth can be attributed to technological innovation, gains in\nknowledge, diffusion of technology, or similar innovation-related factors. 50\'5 \' Although\nthe precise amount of their contributions to economic growth, prosperity, and\nperformance remain unresolved, the consensus is that technological innovation has\ncontributed significantly to the economic growth of post-World War II United States,\nin general, 52 and the U.S. commercial aviation industry, in particular. 53 Economists,\nsuch as David, point out that "technological innovation is the primary, if not the only\nmeans of improving industrial productivity. It is the force propelling the American\neconomy forward and a process [that is) inextricably linked to knowledge transfer and\ndiffusion."54\nThe importance of the U.S. aerospace industry to the American economy is illustrated\nin the following commentary offered by the Aerospace Industries Association:\nIn 1987, U.S. aerospace exports totaled nearly $32 billion. Imports of similar goods\nwere approximately $10 billion for a positive sector trade balance of $22 billion. This\nwas a net improvement of $4 billion over 1988. In fact, the U.S. sectoral trade balance\nin aerospace products has improved every year since 1984. The contrast to other U.S.\nmanufacturing industries is striking. The trade trend for high-tech U.S. industries, such\nas computers and automobiles, has been steadily negative. For such industries the goal\n\n230\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 8/No. 2/1 991\n\nis reversing these persistent negative trends; for U.S. aerospace, the goal is to maintain\nits positive trade balance. 55 In spite of its importance to the U.S. economy and the\nbalance of trade, very little is known about technological innovation and the diffusion\nof knowledge in the aerospace industry, either in terms of the channels used to\ncommunicate the ideas and the information-gathering habits and practices of the\nmembers of the aerospace social system. Therefore, it is likely that an understanding\nof the process by which aerospace STI is Communicated through certain channels over\ntime among the members of the aerospace social system would contribute to stimulating\ntechnological innovation, maximizing the R&D process, increasing R&D productivity,\nand improving and maintaining the professional competence of U.S. aerospace\nengineers and scientists.\n\nPROJECT PUBLICATIONS\n\nBlados, Walter R., Thomas E.
