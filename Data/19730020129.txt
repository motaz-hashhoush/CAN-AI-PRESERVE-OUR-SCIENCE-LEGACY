This objective was carried out by:\n(1) examining the nature of currently planned and new evolutionary geosynchronous programs; (2) investigating alternate ways of conducting these\nmissions and defining the required logistics support; and (3) developing concepts for new systems to support geosynchronous programs in an effective and\neconomical manner. The resulting data will contribute to a planning base\nfor future space activities.\nThe development of low-cost concepts that meet necessary levels of performance is paramount in today\'s economic environment. Toward this end,\ngeosynchronous programs offer the potential of grouping adjacent payload\nfunctions in a manner which retains their earth access geometry. Payload or\nfunction grouping offers potential economies through reduced individual spacecraft inventories and their attendant transportation costs. Additional\nbenefits from on-orbit servicing are also possible. Serviceable spacecraft\nconcepts are currently being explored by NASA and the industry to determine\ntheir potential application to low-cost program approaches. Added logistics\nbenefits are possible through the concentration of servicing operations into\nfew orbiting elements.\nPotentially dramatic growth projections for geosynchronous operations\ncontributed to the need for this study. Major growth is forecast for both\ndomestic and international communications relay services. Enhancement of\nastronomy and earth-observation programs is envisioned with payloads in geosynchronous orbits. Other useful benefits, such as navigation and traffic\ncontrol, can best be provided by means of geosynchronous elements. Also, new\nand advanced geosynchronous concepts for space power and light have been\nidentified. The delivery and operating economies resulting from space shuttle\nand reusable tug operations will accelerate these geosynchronous orbit\nactivities. Such growth projections raise questions concerning the possibility\nof overcrowding this limited natural resource if all functions continue to be\nperformed by individual satellites. Planning to avoid such a condition is\nvital. Progress in achieving the benefits available from space must not be\nimpeded by the lack of timely planning information.\nAPPROACH AND SCOPE\n\nThe basic approach taken in this study was to define two geosynchronous\ntraffic models and to develop a logical pattern of subsequent analyses leading\nto the definition of system requirements and conceptual platform designs for\n_each model. The first, called the "baseline traffic model" was based upon\n\'current NASA mission planning information, notably the updated NASA Mission\nModel, 6 June 1972. The second, the "new traffic model", was derived during\n\n1-1\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nthe study from forecasts and demand models of individual user functions.\nmodel was separately analyzed with the following objectives:\n1.\n\nTo determine the nature and degree of satellite congestion\nit represented\n\n2.\n\nTo determine the grouping capability of geosynchronous payloads\ninto multifunction units\n\n3.\n\nTo define system level requirements, including variations in\non-orbit servicing modes\n\n4.\n\nEach\n\nTo establish representative platform conceptual designs\n\nAlternative geosynchronous programs were defined using various configurations\nand operational modes, which were then evaluated to determine a recommended\ngeosynchronous program approach. Later, attention was focused on transportation interfaces in order to define the desired match between geosynchronous\nplatforms and transportation system elements.\nAs shown in Figure 1-1, the study was divided into six basic task areas,\nfive of which were further organized into two parts for the two traffic\nmodels. The principal task flow is sequential within each set of traffic\nmodel oriented analyses as depicted by the solid arrows linking study blocks.\nA lesser relationship, mostly task methodology, exists between the two traffic\noriented parts of each task as depicted by the dashed arrows. This pattern of\ntask interrelationships preserves the traceability of platforms and programs\nto the baseline traffic model which has received widespread use throughout\nNASA as a planning and analysis tool.\nTask 1.0 comprised all the efforts leading to the construction of the\nnew traffic model. Task 2.0 provided basic geosynchronous orbit characteristics\nand EM spectrum utilization data for use in other task areas. Orbit saturation\nanalyses were conducted in Task 3.0. Satellite distributions for each traffic\nmodel were analyzed for low crowding and potential physical or EM interference\nconditions. Task 4.0 produced functional grouping options and resultant system level requirements for space platforms including remote and manned on-orbit\nservicing modes. Physical, functional, and operational interface requirements\nbetween platforms and the transportation system were also determined. Conceptual platform designs were synthesized in Task 5.0. Emphasis was on configuration features favoring evolution from auto-remote to manned servicing\nconcepts. Preferred concepts for platform/transportation interfaces were\nestablished. Program options and evaluations utilizing the platform configurations and servicing modes derived in the study were structured in Task\n6.0. Evaluation results, along with key findings from all study tasks, were\nused for the derivation of a recommended geosynchronous program approach.\nThe study was accomplished and documented during the 12-month period\nfrom 26 June 1972 to 29 June 1973. The study results are recorded in seven\nbasic volumes.

From\nthe study evaluations and from earlier traffic analysis and platform synthesis\nactivities, the following principal conclusions and findings were derived:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSelected groupings of functions/payloads on platforms are\nfeasible and desirable.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor each major function, single platform designs capable\nof operating with any of three servicing modes (remote,\nEVA, shirtsleeve) appear feasible.\n\n0\n\n\xd1\x84\n\nBoth remote-serviced and man-attended programs with multifunction platforms offer significant cost savings over\nconventional programs with expendable satellites, even\nwith the high servicing levels assumed.\nPlatforms are cost effective because of hardware commonality and reduced inventories.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStandardized packaging is feasible for all platform subsystems and most mission equipment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWith appropriate functional grouping, a single utilities\nsupport module design can economically support all defined\ngeosynchronous payloads. It also offers the likely capability of supporting development and technology payloads\nthat are yet to be defined.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe new traffic model is more representative of the full\npotential for geosynchronous operations than the baseline\nmodel. It is based on global demands, and provides\nincreased utilitarian benefits to mankind.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSatellite physical contention is not likely to be a\ncritical problem through the 1990 time period, even\nwithout retrieval.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGeosynchronous EMI contention will likely occur before\n1990 if wider spectrum usage is not employed by\ncommunications relay systems. Platforms using both Cand K-bands would eliminate this problem.\n\n2-1\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nS-band EMI problems currently exist among users in all\norbits and will be compounded by increased space traffic.\nGeosynchronous platforms would aid in reducing these\nproblems by lowering the number of traffic elements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCooperation and planning will be required on both\nnational and international levels to preclude physical\nand EMI contention.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWith relatively minor modifications, the baseline shuttle\nand tug capabilities* can meet the transportation needs of\nthe geosynchronous programs defined during the study.\n\n9\n\nApplication of a solar electric propulsion stage to geosynchronous platform programs is feasible and offers\nincreased payloads, but only at the expense of operational\ncomplexities associated with payload exchange operations\nand long trip times.\n\nRECOMMENDED GEOSYNCHRONOUS PROGRAM APPROACH\n\nThe more significant conclusions of the study are that grouping of functions or payloads is feasible and that on-orbit servicing offers potential\ngains in shuttle/tug utilization efficiency, and further, that it is possible\nto design platforms offering the flexibility of operating with all three\nservicing modes, mechanical-remote, EVA/IVA man-attended (pressure suited),\nand shirtsleeve man-attended. Thus, a program approach which emphasizes\nselected groupings of payloads, tailored to standardized support levels and\nrelated hardware packaging, and which offers the flexibility for accommodating\nvarious servicing modes, is recommended. This holds open the option for\nfuture decisions on preferred servicing modes based on added experience in\nboth serviceable spacecraft design and actual servicing operations. The\ninherent capabilities of man in situ may prove to be the dominant factor in\nestablishing the preferred servicing concept.\nThe pre-Phase A study shows only the basic characteristics of the desired\nprogram approach. Future efforts are required to translate this general\napproach into specific development activities. Geosynchronous traffic and\nrelated mission equipment must be better defined, payload grouping options\nmust be refined and further developed, common support requirements must be\nsized to match the improved traffic definition and the new grouping options,\non-orbit servicing techniques must be developed and,the corresponding modularized hardware designs must be synthesized.\n\nShuttle payload is 65,000 pounds. Tug round-trip payload to geosynchronous\norbit is 3225 pounds.\n\n2-2\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n3.0 GEOSYNCHRONOUS MISSION CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe general characteristics of geosynchronous missions were defined\nand examined so that earth coverage, spectrum utilization phenomena, and\nrelated operational features required in other task areas could be determined. Basic parametric data and analytical relationships governing these\nphenomena were derived for application to the specific missions and functions\ncontained in the traffic models. The resulting fundamental data are intended\nto be useful for other advanced mission planning activities as well as the\nones in this study. These data were organized and documented separately in\nVolume III, which emphasizes the derivation and use of the data.\nThe defined mission data include the ground-trace and earth-coverage\ncharacteristics of geostationary, inclined, and other related geosynchronous\norbits. Line-of-sight geometries were determined, along with preferred\nsatellite locations for various representative surface aim points and coverage zones. Earth-sun-satellite geometry patterns were defined which affect\nsolar noise levels in communication links and which define periods of solar\noccultation where solar array power output is reduced or terminated. Orbit\nperturbations were defined and their effects on orbital motions summarized.\nDelta-V requirements to offset these perturbations were also derived.\nMission profile characteristics were constructed depicting all the major\nevents required to place payloads at any specified location in geosynchronous\norbit. Both placement and retrieval.were considered, along with their\nrespective delta-V budgets. Spectrum data included the definition of the\nusable spectrum in terms of natural phenomena effects (atmosphere and weather),\nfrequency allocations through international agreements, and available technology. Important coverage enhancement and improved spectrum utilization\nfactors were developed through frequency reuse techniques.\nMISSION CHARACTERISTICS DEFINITION\n\nFundamental mission characteristics data were developed for both geosynchronous and related orbits. In the context of this study, geosynchronous\norbits are defined as circular orbits that have a period equal to the mean\nrate of rotation of the earth. Included within this family of orbits are\nboth geosynchronous equatorial (geostationary) and inclined circular orbits.\nNoncircular "24-hour" orbits were considered to be within the family of\nrelated orbits.\nThe basic relationships defining the characteristics of geosynchronous\norbits are derived, fundamental characteristics are discussed, and specific\ndata for selected cases are presented in Volume III.\nThese data constitute\n\'the fundamental geosynchronous mission characteristics that were used throughout the study for (1) defining preferred satellite locations for a variety of\nspacecraft types and/or mission functions, (2) defining the number of spacecraft required to satisfy earth-spacecraft line-of-sight requirements,\n\n3-1\nSP 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n(3) developing the time-phased geographic distributions of the satellites\ndefined in the study traffic models, and (4) conducting geosynchronous orbit\nsaturation analyses.\nOrbit and Earth Coverage Characteristics\nThe general characteristics of geosynchronous orbits are most simply\ndefined in terms of the ground trace of the subsatellite point. These\ncharacteristics, plus the general earth-viewing geometry, define the earth\ncoverage which is achievable. A representative family of geosynchronous orbit\nground traces are shown in Figure 3-1, in which a geographic longitude of the\nascending node of zero degrees is assumed. As can be seen from the figure,\nthe ground trace is, in general, described by a "figure eight" with the\nlongitudinal excursion of the trace increasing with increasing inclination.\nAlso, the absolute value of the latitude extreme is equal to the orbit\ninclination. The only exception is a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero degrees. Spacecraft in these geostationary orbits appear to\nhave no relative motion with respect to a stationary observer on the earth.\nLATITUDE, DEGREES\n\ni.ll\'.J.

As can be seen from\nthe earth-spacecraft viewing geometry, the viewing characteristics are\ndependent upon the minimum allowable surface incidence angle (<*). (For earthspacecraft communications, the surface incidence angle corresponds to the\nground station mask angle.) For example, all points on the earth within a\nminor circle defined by an earth central angle of 152.67 degrees will be\n\n3-2\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFigure 3-2,\n\nEarth-Spacecraft Viewing Characteristics\n\nwithin line of sight with a surface incidence angle greater than or equal to\n5 degrees. Increasing the minimum allowable incidence angle to 10 degrees\nresults in a decrease in the total earth coverage which is achievable. For\nthis case, the total earth coverage is described by a minor circle defined by\nan earth central angle of 142.87 degrees.\nRepresentative earth coverage characteristics are shown in Figure 3-3 for\na geosynchronous equatorial ( t = 0) orbit. For this figure, the spacecraft\ngeostationary location was arbitrarily assumed to be at a geographic longitude\nof 100\xc2\xb0W. The coverage provided by other geostationary satellites can be\nobtained by translating the coverage traces along the equator.\nMultiple geostationary satellites provide overlapping coverage with the\nmagnitude of the overlap dependent upon the longitudinal separation of the\nspacecraft. The coverage overlap can be defined in terms of the maximum\nlatitude of overlapping coverage as illustrated in Figure 3-4. From this\nfigure, the maximum latitude of continuous coverage can be determined as a\nfunction of the number of spacecraft in a multiple spacecraft network assuming\na uniform longitudinal distribution. For example, a four-spacecraft network\nwith a spacecraft separation of 90 degrees can provide total and continuous\ncoverage between 70.5\xc2\xb0S and 70.5\xc2\xb0N with a minimum surface incidence angle of\n5 degrees.\n\n3-3\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFigure 3-3.

Latitude Limits for Overlapping Coverage ( t = 0)\n\n3-4\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nAs can be seen from Figure 3-3, coverage of the polar regions cannot be\nprovided by geostationary satellites. It is necessary to utilize nongeostationary orbits for coverage of the polar regions. As shown in the\ndiscussion of the ground trace characteristics of geosynchronous orbits, the\nground trace of a non-geostationary orbit appears to describe a figure eight.\nTherefore, the coverage characteristics are a function of time, and the timephased coverage characteristics vary with inclination.\nThe general pattern of earth coverage characteristics provided by inclined geosynchronous orbits is illustrated in Figure 3-5. Four basic types\nof coverage generally exist. A region of continuous coverage (Q) exists\nwith dimensional characteristics dependent upon the orbit inclination and the\nground station mask angle. The second region ((2)) is that surface area which\nis never within line of sight. The remaining regions ((|)and (4)) are peridoically within line of sight, with the duration of visibility dependent upon\nthe orbit inclination, the mask angle, and the relative location within the\nregions. Ground stations (or terrestrial traffic elements, ships, aircraft,\netc.) in region y) are within line of sight during a single continuous\nperiod of less than 24 hours each day. Ground stations within region 0\nhave two periods each day when a geosynchronous satellite will be within line\nof sight. The two daily periods are, in general, unequal, the exception being\nsites along the equator viewing a satellite in a circular, inclined 24-hour\norbit. These sites will be within line of site during two equal periods each\nday.\n\nj REGION 0)\n1 REGION QD\n1\nREGION \xc2\xa9\n- REGION (4)\n\nCONTINUOUS COVERAGE\nNO COVERAGE\nPERIODIC COVERAGE (SINGLE DAILY CONTACT)\nPERIODIC COVERAGE (TWO DAILY CONTACTS)\n\nFigure 3-5.

For inclined geosynchronous orbits, the duration of\nline of sight must also be considered since the earth coverage characteristics\nof inclined orbits vary with time.\nThe fundamental geometric considerations for establishing preferred geosynchronous satellite locations are illustrated in Figure 3-6. The resultant\nallowable relative longitude is shown in Figure 3-7 as a function of the geographic latitude of the ground site for a range of surface incidence angles.\nFor a surface incidence angle (\xc2\xb00 of five degrees, the limiting earth central\nangle (\xd1\x82 /2) is 76.33 degrees. Therefore, a geostationary satellite, or an\ninclined geosynchronous satellite when at either the ascending or descending\nnode, will be within line of sight of points on the earth equator between plus\nor minus 76.33 degrees of the subsatellite point. Also, the maximum latitude\nthat will be within line of sight is also 76.33 degrees at a relative longitude of zero.\nThe allowable geographic longitude limits for geostationary satellites\nwere developed for a representative set of geographic locations within major\nworld-wide geographic areas. For example, 14 locations were used to grossly\ndefine the limiting geographic boundaries of Canada and the United States\n(including Alaska and Hawaii). The basic characteristics and utility of these\ndata are illustrated in Figure 3-8. For this illustration, three specific\nsites have been chosen: Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada; St. John\'s,\nIsland of Newfoundland; and London, England. In this example, a Canadian\ndomestic satellite (Domsat) must be located between 122 degrees west longitude\nand 83 degrees west longitude if total coverage of Canada, from Inuvik to\nSt. John\'s, is required. Canadian Domsats which are west of this longitude\nband will exclude coverage of the western parts of Canada. The other example\nshown in Figure 3-8 illustrates the required geographic longitude of an international communications satellite (Intelsat) for communications between\nSt. John\'s, Canada, and London, England. Communications between St. John\'s\nand London can be provided via an Intelsat satellite located anywhere between\n78 degrees west longitude and 17 degrees east longitude. If a more westerly\nCanadian ground site is required, the allowable eastern limit of the satellite\nlocation must be decreased. Also, if more easterly sites within Europe must\nbe considered, the western limit quoted above must be decreased.\nA summary of the preferred satellite locations for world-wide coverage\nis shown in Figure 3-9. The satellite locations are representative only,\nsince they will be dictated by the particular earth coverage requirement.\n\n3-6\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFigure 3-6.

The tesseral harmonic term produces an apparent longitudinal\n"drift" about one or two stable points (75\xc2\xb0E and 105\xc2\xb0W longitude), with the\namplitude of the drift being equal to the initial displacement from the stable\npoint. The luni-solar perturbations produce long-term variations in orbit\ninclination with specific characteristics dependent upon the initial orientation of the orbital plane. Solar pressure perturbations produce a cyclic\nvariation in the orbit eccentricity.\nThe perturbations produced by the tesseral harmonic term in the earth\npotential result in an effective geographic longitudinal oscillation about\nthe major axis of the earth and a radial oscillation about the mean geosynchronous altitude. These effects are as illustrated in Figure 3-10, assuming\n,no spacecraft initial position or velocity errors. As illustrated, the\nspacecraft longitudinal oscillation about the equatorial major axis (stable\naxis) has an amplitude equal to the initial longitudinal displacement from\nthe stable axis (located at 75\xc2\xb0E or 105\xc2\xb0W longitude). The approximate period\nof the oscillation varies from two to eight years depending upon the initial\ndisplacement from one of the stable points.\nALTITUDE DEVIATION^.

Tesseral Harmonics Perturbations\n(Residual Velocity Error = 0)\n3-9\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nThe radial oscillation about the mean geosynchronous altitude has the\nsame period as the longitudinal oscillation and its amplitude is a function\nof the initial displacement. As shown in Figure 3-10, the maximum radial\noscillation amplitude is approximately VI8 nautical miles with respect to\nthe mean geosynchronous orbit altitude and occurs when the initial displacement from one of the stable points approaches 90 degrees.\nLuni-solar perturbations cause a long-term oscillation of the geosynchronous orbit inclination. Because of the long period of the cycle\n(over 50 years), luni-solar perturbations of geosynchronous orbits are usually\napproximated as a simplified secular motion. The mean geosynchronous orbit\nmotion due to these perturbations is similar to the regression of the orbit\nof the moon due to the gravitational effect of the sun. For geosynchronous\norbits, however, the orbit regression is with respect to a reference plane\ninclined approximately 7.3 degrees with respect to the equatorial plane.\nThe resultant orbit inclinations are illustrated in Figure 3-11 for two\ninitial orbit inclinations. The inclination of an initial equatorial orbit\n(t 0 = 0) would be 7.3 degrees with respect to the reference plane and would\nretain this inclination. As a result, the inclination with respect to the\nequator varies from zero to a maximum of 14.6 degrees and back to zero in\napproximately 53 years. The variation in the inclination with respect to the\nequator of initially non-zero inclination orbits (LO ? \xc2\xb0) is dependent upon\nthe initial right ascension of the geosynchronous orbit ascending node. For\nthe worst-case initial orientation, the inclination varies from LO + 14.6\ndegrees over a period (>53 years), which is a function of the initial inclination (t-o)- This characteristic is illustrated in Figure 3-11 by the case in\nwhich the initial inclination is 5 degrees and the initial right ascension of\nthe ascending node is 180 degrees. As can be seen from the figure, the\ninclination with respect to the equator will reach a maximum of 19.6 degrees\nafter approximately 27 years.\nSolar pressure produces a cyclic orbit-eccentricity perturbation whose\nmagnitude depends upon the satellite area-to-weight ratio. Since the direction of the perturbing force sweeps through 360 degrees as the earth orbits\nthe sun each year, the maximum eccentricity deviation occurs six months after\nthe end of active (stationkeeping) operations. The perturbing force sweeps\nthrough the opposite hemisphere and nulls its effects during the last half of\nthe year, and the orbit is again circular after the full year.\nThe eccentric orbits produce an apparent longitudinal libration with\nrespect to the earth, since the angular motion of an eccentric orbit is not\nconstant. The libration magnitude is also dependent upon the satellite areato-weight ratio and occurs when the eccentricity perturbation is maximum.\nFor an Intelsat IV, the area-to-weight ratio is approximately 0.006 ft 2 /lb,\nwhich results in a maximum longitudinal libration of less than 0.1 degree.\n\n3-10\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n-..\n\neot-\n\n\xd0\xa3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .: -TIT:\n\nALTITUDE = 19,323 I..M.\'\n\ni\n\nIIIITIAL RIGHT ASCEHSIOli\nOF ASCEHUIUG IIODE (\xd0\x9f\xe2\x80\x9e)\n(DEGREES)\n\ni - LJ.J\nFigure 3-11.\n\nMean Geosynchronous Luni-Solar Perturbation Effects\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM UTILIZATION\n\nUtilization of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum as the communication\nlink between earth and geosynchronous satellites is limited by many factors\xc2\xbb\nsuch as frequency allocations, atmospheric and environmental effects, and\ntechnology availability. This section of the report defines these factors and\ntheir effect on spectrum utilization. Improvement of spectrum utilization can\nbe obtained by modulation and spatial-discrimination techniques that allow\nmultiple use of the same frequency bands. These techniques are outlined, and\ntheir limitations are discussed. The data are developed into a format that is\nuseful to planners of geosynchronous missions. Frequency bands may be selected\nand systems conceived that will support geosynchronous missions within the\nlimitations defined.\nSpectrum Allocations\n\nThe first set of data presented depicts the total range of the frequency\nspectrum from low frequency (LF, 100 kHz) through the gamma ray region to 20\n10\nHz. A series of eight charts (refer to Volume III) was developed to show\nworld-wide frequency allocations for various services and specific propogation\ncharacteristics. To date, no frequency allocations have been made above 275\nGHz.\n\n3-11\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpecific frequency allocations for space services were tabulated,including\nall frequency allocations established for world-wide use by the World Administrative Radio Conference in mid-1971. These allocations became effective as\nof January 1973. A summary of these allocations for fixed satellite and intersatellite service is shown in Table 3-1. Of particular interest to this study\nare the fixed satellite service allocations usable for data relay-type\nmissions. Data relay missions are the most extensive users of the available\nfrequency spectrum.\nTransmission Phenomena\nHigher frequency bands are needed to support the large quantities of data\n(and, therefore, bandwidth usage) forecast during the time period of interest\nto this study. Presently, C-band (3.7 - 4.2 GHz downlink, 5.9 - 6.4 GHz uplink) is being utilized for data relay missions. To support the presently\nprojected requirement, frequency bands above 10 GHz will be needed. Although\nthese bands allow much greater data link capacity, atmospheric effects are\nmore severe and must be carefully considered to provide high-quality communications. Data were compiled defining the atmospheric attenuation effects and\nidentifying the atmospheric windows.\nWeather effects are more severe as the operational frequencies increase\nabove 7 to 8 GHz. Geosynchronous missions must account for increased signal\nmargins in the communication links to ensure reliable signals during bad\nweather periods. Above 12 GHz, these margins approach 15 to 30 dB. A series\nof charts was constructed to define variations in signal attenuation with\nfrequency and rain levels. Statistical rainfall data for different geographic\nareas were included to provide an indication of the likelihood of encountering\nadverse conditions. These data are useful in conducting link operational\nassurance/reliability studies. Also included were data illustrating the\nadvantage of ground station geographical diversity under bad weather conditions.\nAvailable Technology\nTechnology limitations were postulated for the upper ranges of allocated\nfrequencies. State of the art of microwave and millimeter-wave hardware,and\nthe limitation in providing space-proven equipment with the necessary performance,will constrain the use of frequencies during the 1990 time period to\napproximately 30 GHz. As shown in Table 3-2, this capability is sufficient\nto support the 1985-1990 projected traffic. Use of the 11/14 GHz and 20/30\nGHz bands for data relay functions increases the usable bandwidth by a factor\nof eight over the presently used C-band (4/6 GHz). With the addition of\nfeasible and proven techniques for "frequency reuse", the data rate per degree\nlongitude of orbital space will approach 10 x 109 bps. This compares favorably\nto the 1.5 x 10^ bps per degree projected for the new traffic model. Use of\nmulti-beam spacecraft antenna systems, orthogonal polarization RF propogation,\nnarrow beamwidth ground antennas, and multiple access modulation techniques\nallows simultaneous frequency operation up to six times at the highest frequency band, 20/30 GHz.\n\n3 12\n\n\'\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 3-1.\n\nWARC-ST Allocations Above 10 GHz\nLink\n\nFrequency Band (GHz)\n\nBandwidth\n\nFixed Satellite Service\n\nSpace to\nEarth\n\nEarth to\nSpace\n\n(MHz)\n\n2.5 to 2.535\n2.655 to 2.690\n\n35\n35\n\n2, 3\n2, 3\n\n(GHz)\n\n3.7 to 4.2\n5.925 to 6.425\n\n0.5\n0.5\n\nX\n\n7.25 to 7.75\n7.90 to 8.40\n10.95 to 11.2/11.45 to 11.7\n11.7 to 12.2\n12.5 to 12.75\n14.0 to 14.5\n\n0.5\n0.5\n\nX\n\n0.5\n0.5\n0.25\n0.5\n\n40.0 to 41.0\n50.0 to 51.0\n\n1.0\n1.0\n\n92.0 to 95.0\n102.0 to 105.0\n\n3.0\n3.0\n\nX\n\nto\nto\nto\nto\n\n2.0\n2.0\n\nX\n\n140.0\n150.0\n220.0\n265.0\n\n142.0\n152.0\n230.0\n275.0\n\nX\nX\nX\n2*\n1, 3*\n\n1, 2\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n10.0\n10.0\n\nInter-Satellite Service\n54.25\n105.0\n170.0\n185.0\n\nto\nto\nto\nto\n\n8.95\n25.0\n12.0\n5.0\n\n58.2/59.0 to 64.0\n130.0\n182.0\n190.0\n\nindicates world region for this link.\nin the WARC documents.\n\nThere are three regions defined\n\n3-13\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 3-2.

Multiple-beam radiation techniques were limited to pointing\nseparations of approximately two or three beamwidths. Orthogonal polarization\nradiation was found to provide up to 30 dB isolation between radiated signals,\nthus allowing double use of the frequency. Ground antenna discrimination by\nuse of narrow beamwidth antennas will allow closely spaced satellites operating\non the same frequency. Such operation provides the greatest potential for\nfrequency reuse.\nFigure 3-12 illustrates the orbital spacing that can be accommodated with\ndifferent size ground station antennas. This data was generated for C-band\noperation to illustrate antenna sizes necessary to remain within the allowable\nCCIR limits of inter-satellite interference. The interference model was based\non an eleven-satellite cluster equally spaced. Examination shows that a 60foot ground antenna would allow a spacing of 4.6 degrees between satellites\nat C-band. Spacing could be closer for the higher frequencies (KLO - \xd0\x9f/\xd0\x98\nGHz and Km " 17/30 GHz) with feasible ground antenna sizes (30-foot diameter).\nThe total data transfer capability via geosynchronous operations could, therefore, be even greater than indicated in Table 3-2, with the use of the higher\nfrequency bands and spacing closer than 4.6 degrees. Thus, it is technologically feasible to support the traffic requirements projected through the 1990\ntime period using available frequencies below 31 GHz.\n\n3-14\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nD/X =\n\n3000\n\n364319 225 158\n9785\n\n60\n\n42 ANTENNA DIAMETER-FT\n\n2000 -\n\nINTERFERENCE\nNOISE POWER -\n\nFOR 11 SATELLITES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ALL SAME "C" BAND FREQ\n\xe2\x80\xa2 24 CHANNEL TRANSPONDERS\n\n200-\n\n100\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nSATELLITE SPACING -DEGREES\n\nFigure 3-12.

The first, called the baseline traffic model, was derived from\ncurrently planned geosynchronous missions. It was structured from mission\nplanning and source material widely familiar to the NASA and the total aerospace community and thus provides a convenient comparison and traceability\nof study results to other past and on-going industry activities. The second\nmodel, the new traffic model, was derived by a totally different approach.\nIt was based on a "bottom-up" approach utilizing quantitative forecasts of\nuser demand levels. Traffic is correlated to the utilitarian benefits it\nprovides to mankind.\nThe new traffic model reflects the dynamic growth in satellite communications and other space applications which are just beginninq to emerge. It is\nintended to represent the full potential for geosynchronous traffic through\nthe 1990 time period. Both of these traffic models form the basis for defining\nthe nature, numbers, and schedules of geosynchronous mission activities which\nare utilized as basic study tools providing key input data to other study tasks.\nThe new model defines the time-phased distribution of satellites necessary for\nassessment of orbit saturation conditions; geosynchronous functions and mission\nschedules are defined for use in functional grouping analyses and the determination of platform requirements; geosynchronous program objectives and capability levels are established for use in developing alternate program approaches,\n\nBASELINE TRAFFIC\n\nThe construction of the baseline traffic model was centered around the\ncompilation and review of related mission planning and systems definition data.\nDescriptive mission material from all sources were reviewed and correlated in\norder to group pertinent data into specific mission/functional categories.\nThe principal source for the baseline traffic definition was the "Updated\nNASA Mission Model" (6 June 1972) in Reference 4-1. This model identifies the\ncurrently envisioned space missions from 1973 through 1990 for seven basic\ncategories as listed below:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nAstronomy\nSpace physics\nEarth observations\nEarth and ocean physics\n\n5. Communications and navigation\n6. Life science\n7. Space technology and\nmaterials science\n\nHowever, the model did not explicity identify those spacecraft which would\nbe expected to operate in geosynchronous orbit. It was necessary, therefore,\nto review additional data from the "Fleming" Model in Reference 4-2 and other\nmission planning and definition material from References 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5\nto establish a final pattern of geosynchronous missions.\n\n4-1\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nThe original seven mission categories were changed to five. Categories\n2, 6, and 7 were deleted as not appropriate to geosynchronous orbits. Their\nobjectives could be more economically achieved through other, lower-altitude\norbits. A "Non-NASA Operational Satellite" category was added to account for\ncommercial communications and other non-developmental satellites. After\nthese basic categories of geosynchronous missions were defined, specific\ndelivery schedules were constructed for the individual satellite types in each\ncategory.\nThe fundamental schedule structure was derived from two principal sources\n(References 4-1 and 4-2), and additional information from other sources was\nutilized as necessary to fill in important missing elements. The resulting\ndelivery schedule for the baseline traffic model is shown in Table 4-1 in\nthree parts, each reflecting a different prime information source. Delivery\nschedules for satellites in the first four mission categories (Part A) were\nobtained directly from the NASA Mission Model (Reference 4-1). This covers\nall satellites in these categories for the entire period from 1973 through\n1990.\nHowever, the NASA Mission Model did not treat the expected non-NASA\noperational missions (fifth category) for which the NASA would provide launch\nsupport. To fill this void, the non-NASA operational spacecraft schedules\ndefined in the "Fleming" Mission Model (Reference 4-2) were utilized. This\nmodel covered only the time period from 1979 through 1990 (Part B). The\nremaining delivery schedules in the 1973 through 1978 time period (Part C) for\nthe non-NASA operational spacecraft were obtained primarily from information\navailable in the open literature.\nAs shown in Table 4-1, a total of 180 satellites was identified in the\'\nbaseline traffic model, with the majority (118) being non-NASA operational\nspacecraft. Peak traffic densities, in terms of the number of deliveries per\nyear, range from 14 to 16. The resultant average delivery rate for the 18-year\nperiod is 10 satellite deliveries per year.\nTo complete the definition of the baseline traffic model, the time-phased\ndistributions of satellites were derived. Preferred placement criteria and\nlocation rationale for each satellite type were developed from the payload\nand mission descriptive material contained in References 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5.\nThese criteria are based primarily on earth-viewing or line-of-sight access\nconsiderations. In general, the astronomy and NASA communications and navigation payloads are located such that direct communications and in some cases,\nviewing of the contiguous United States, is possible. The non-NASA operational\nspacecraft have, in general\xc2\xbb a world-wide distribution with specific locations\ndependent upon access to each of the continental regions. These location\ncriteria were applied to each satellite type, along with quantitative earth\ncoverage data from Volume III to define bands of permissible locations. They\nare shown in Figure 4-1 and are discussed briefly below.\nMany of the NASA programs require access to the contiguous United States\nfor simpler data links and/or domestic data-gathering purposes. The programs\ninclude astronomy, earth observations, and some of the communications and\nnavigation satellites. Satellite locations between 55 and 135 degrees west\nlongitude satisfy these requirements.\n\n4-2\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n\xd1\x88\n\xe2\x80\xa2\no\n\xd0\xbe\n\n(\xd0\xb2\n\n<u\n\nCO\n\nCVJ\n\nr^\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbb\n\n\xd1\x8e \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\nin\n\nu-i\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n__\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\x93>\xd1\x87\n\n<N\n\nCM\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 CO\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\nm\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n0 <\xd0\xbc >\xd0\xbb \xd0\xbe- \xd1\x81\xd0\xbc \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n_\n\n-\n\n-\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 CO\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-\n\n,-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-\n\n- -\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n_\n-\n\n-\n\n--\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 CM \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n4-3\n\n^\n\n^_\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\'\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xc2\xab\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xbe.\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5.\n\n\xd0\xbe_\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xc2\xab\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xbe_\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nCO\n\nCM \xd0\x9e \xe2\x80\x94 ~-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n^\n\n\xd0\xbe <> tx \xd0\xbe m \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n^\nCM CM\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 CM \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM CM \xc2\xabM\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 ^~\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 c\xc2\xab\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM \xd0\xae \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2~ c\xc2\xbb\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc \xd1\x87)-\n\nCM CM CM \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 CM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 4> \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 CM CM \xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\nCM\n\nCM CM \xe2\x80\x94 ^\n\nCM CM M CM\n\nCO\n\nCM \xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM CM\n\nMf \xe2\x80\xa2-\n\nCOMMUNICATION SATELLITE\nU.S. DOMESTIC COMMUNICATION\nFOREIGN DOMESTIC COMMUNICATION\nNAVIGATION AND TRAFFIC CONTROL\nSYNCHRONOUS METEOROLOGICAL\nSYNCHRONOUS EARTH RESOURCES\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nSD 73-SA-Q036-2\n\nNON-NASA\nOPERATIONAL\nSPACECRAFT\n\n_l\n\n!i\n\n1\n\nj\n\n1\n\n(\nD\n\nS\nS\n\ns\n\n4)\nOO\n\n\xd0\x93\xd1\x87\nOO\n\n\xc2\xabn\n\nOO\n\n3 -\n\ns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2>\n*-* 5\n\nJi5\n\n\xc2\xab\xd0\xbb J\n\nae\n3\n\nIU >\n\nCM\nOO\n\nOO\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n00\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n-\n\n1 EARTH AND OCEAN\nGEOPAUSE\nI PHYSICS\nCOMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS TECHNOLOGY SATELLITE\n& NAVIGATION\nCOOPERATIVE APPLICATIONS SATELLITE\nSMALL APPL.

Two active satellites are\nplaced such that direct communications with a single ground station is possible\nand an on-orbit spare is located midway between the two active satellites.\nThe applications technology satellite (ATS) locations are dependent upon\nmission objectives yet to be defined and thus are shown as a dashed line\nindicating potential placement anywhere.\nThe non-NASA satellite location bands followed similar patterns. The\ncommunications satellites were placed in three location bands centered over\nthe Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. These permit world-wide international communications between the major land masses. U.S. domestic communications is, of course, limited by access to the continental U.S., Hawaii, and\nAlaska. Foreign Domsat communications were located to provide coverage for\nCanada, Central and South America, Europe/Africa, and Asia. The non-NASA\nmeteorological and earth resources satellites were configured to be sets of\nfour equally spaced satellites that provide global surveillance capability.\nTheir specific locations were the result of compromises between good viewing\nof weather patterns and low-incidence viewing of agricultural and other land\nmass regions.\n. Examination of the resulting overall pattern of distributions revealed\nthat the functional coverage bands tended to be grouped into six separate\nzones. The criterion for defining these zones was simply that the coverage\nbands could not extend across the zonal boundaries. Six longitudes were found\nwhere this criteria was met. These zones are identified by vertical dashed\nlines in Figure 4-1. Zone 1 provides coverage of Europe and Africa. Coverage\nof Asia and Australia is provided by Zone 2. Zones 3, 4, and 6 provide coverage\nof the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, while Zone 5 provides .coverage of North and\nSouth America. Although there is some potential overlap in coverage between\nadjacent zones, the identified zones were found to be useful in constructing\nthe time-phased distributions of satellite population histories.\nSatellite population histories were determined for each of the six\nzones. Representative mission lifetimes for each type satellite were\nutilized in conjunction with the satellite delivery schedule in Table 4-1 to\nconstruct these population histories. Payload and mission descriptive material\nfrom References 4-3 through 4-7 was reviewed, along with inputs from the open\nliterature on commercial communications satellite plans to establish mission\nlife. Values ranged from one year for the small applications technology satellite to seven years for the commercial communications satellites. The most\ncommon lifetime values ranged from three to five years. Specific data are\npresented in Volume IV, Part 1.\n\n4-7\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nThe resulting active satellite populations are summarized in Figure 4-2.\nPopulation levels are shown for each satellite type along with the total\npopulation in each of the six zones defined above. Population construction\ndetails for each satellite type, including delivery year, period of active\nmission life, and location bands for each delivery, are shown in Volume IV,\nPart 1. Both active and inactive satellite populations are summarized.\nNEW TRAFFIC MODEL\n\nAs indicated earlier, the construction of the new traffic model was based\non a new and different approach. Briefly, it was a "bottom-up" approach which\nincluded: (1) the identification of geosynchronous mission objectives in terms\nof candidate user functions; (2) the formulation of U.S. user demand profiles\nfor each function; (3) the extrapolation of U.S. demand profiles to world-wide\nmodels; and (4) the determination of the number of traffic units required in\nterms of equivalent satellites to those appearing in the baseline traffic model.\nCandidate functions applicable to geosynchronous satellite systems are\nlisted in Table 4-2 under three major categories. Communications and data\nfunctions are those which are applicable to international and domestic\ncommunications satellites. Science and applications functions are principally\ndata-gathering operations supporting both terrestrial resource management and\nbasic research. Also included are the major new functions of space power and\nlight which offer vast benefits to mankind. National defense includes global\ncommunications and sensor functions necessary for national security. While\ngross estimates of DoD traffic were treated in the orbit saturation analyses,\nno attempt was made to analyze the grouping capability or integration of these\npayloads with other non-DoD functions in the definition of space platforms.\nDetailed forecast models were constructed for each of the above functions.\nCurrent traffic levels and projected growth rates from major communications\nindustry sources were utilized. Long-distance traffic was the principal base\nfor these projections. However, further consideration was given to the ratio\nof satellite traffic to total long-distance traffic. The percent of the longdistance traffic projected to be handled via satellite ranged from 1.6 percent\nin 1970 to 30 percent in the year 2000. An example of the resulting forecast\nmodels is presented in Figure 4-3, which shows projected U.S. telephone use\nup to the year 2000. These data reflect both the expected growth in the\nbasic telephone service and the introduction and growth of videophone service,\nwhich utilizes greater increments of data rates. More than an order of\nmagnitude growth in satellite traffic is predicted by 1990. Specific models\nsuch as this were constructed for each of the communications functions. Together they compose a U.S. traffic model.\nThe U.S. traffic forecasts were extended to a world model by ratioing\nuser populations. Census data and population growth rates were obtained for\nvarious world areas. These were refined to include only the literate populations\ngreater than 14 years of age, which were considered to be the principal users\nof the communications functions. These were then ratioed to the U.S. population\nprofile to produce the extrapolation factors for the world-wide communications\n\n4-8\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFigure 4-2.

An example of these concepts is presented in Figure 4-6, which shows a geosynchronous energy relay\nsystem. Terrestrial power generators, favorably located for energy source\nand/or away from already polluted population centers, are depicted beaming\ntheir power via a geosynchronous relay station to the major industralized\nareas of need. Since solar and geothermal power sources could be utilized\nwith this concept, the burden of chemical fuel sources and the amount of\ncombustion pollutants would be reduced. Nuclear power sources could be\nremotely located for safety and for utilizing the vast heat sink capacity of\nthe colder, higher latitude regions. Although these concepts require very\nlarge space installations with attendant needs for advanced, economical space\ntransportation, the potential benefits they offer to mankind are enormous.\n\n4-15\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n4-16\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n5.0 ORBIT SATURATION ANALYSIS\nThe preceding traffic models were analyzed to determine the nature and\ndegree of satellite congestion likely to occur in geosynchronous orbit if\nthe current approach of launching individual payloads is continued through\nthe 1990 time period. The objective of this effort was to determine whether\nsatellite interference is likely to reach levels sufficiently high that a\nneed for multifunction platforms is created purely on a technological basis.\nOther portions of the study (Volume VI) treat the economic and logistics\nadvantages of grouping payloads into space platforms. The orbit saturation\nanalysis included satellite physical contention and electromagnetic interference (EMI) for both active and inactive satellite populations.\nACTIVE SATELLITE CONGESTION\n\nFor the active satellite populations, it was determined that east-west\nstationkeeping capability was the dominant factor influencing the allowable\nphysical spacing between satellites. All satellites placed in geosynchronous\norbit utilize east-west stationkeeping to offset the effects of the tessera!\nharmonic perturbations. Without stationkeeping, these perturbations would\nproduce long-period (2 to 8 years), cyclic,east-west motions carrying the\nsatellites many thousands of miles away from their intended operating locations.\nIn addition to these effects, luni-solar perturbations cause a slow orbit\ninclination drift (approximately 0.9 degree per year) and a nodal precession\nrate of -6.8 degrees per year from an initial nodal position near the vernal\nequinox. Orbit inclination produces a figure-eight ground trace pattern with\nnorth-south latitude excursions equal to the inclination; i.e., an inclination\nof one degree produces latitude excursions of +1.0 degree. Nodal precession\naffects the phase relationship of the satellites within their fiqure-eight\npatterns (their location within the figure-eight pattern as a function of\ntime of day). Neither of these effects poses a serious problem for geosynchronous\nsatellites in meeting their earth coverage requirements. Thus, none of the\nsatellites in the two traffic models defined for this study include north-south\nstationkeeping maneuvers to control these perturbations.\nThe orbit trends of geosynchronous satellites are illustrated in Figure\n5-1. A sequence of three adjacent satellites launched one year apart is\ndepicted. All are presumed to perform east-west stationkeeping within their\nrespective "deadbands" which are shown as shaded bars in the figure. The orbit\ninclination increase with time is also shown along with its effect on the\nfigure eight ground-trace patterns. Since the nodal separation between the\nadjacent satellites is small (6.8 degrees), the relative phase relationships\na,re synchronized to nearly the same time. The satellites nearly parallel each\nother around their figure-eight pattern, maintaining approximately the same\nlateral spacing as at the equatorial crossings. Thus, the allowable physical\nspacing is principally governed by east-west stationkeeping and related\ntolerances. Typical current stationkeeping deadbands range between +0.1 and\n\n5-1\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nOrbit Geometry\n\nGround Traces\n\n-TU\n\n0 /\n\nTime * 0\n\nEquator\nStationkeepino\n"Deadband"\n\n\xd0\xb4 Lat \xc2\xab 0.9\xc2\xb0\ni = 0.9\xc2\xb0\n\xd0\xb4 Lat * 0.9\xc2\xb0\n\ni - 1.8\xc2\xb0\n\ni Lat = 1.8\xc2\xb0\n\nt\n\n>\n\ni "T\n\n\'/ -j\n\ni\n\nI\n/\n5 > \'\n\n5 <;\n\n\'".\n\n,\'\n\'.\n"\n\nLr\'\n\nNodal\n\n5\n\nL=4m.

Applying a 50 percent margin to an average of these values\nproduces an allowable safe spacing criteria of 0.40 degree longitude between\nadjacent satellites. This value was utilized to assess the degree of physical\ncontention existing within the satellite distributions projected for the\ntraffic models in this study.\nIn addition to physical spacing considerations, the active satellite\npopulations were investigated for potential EM interference. A survey of the\nbaseline and new traffic models shows the most populous satellite type, with\nthe highest local satellite concentration to be the communications relays\nwhich operate in the 3.7 to 6.4 GHz, C-band frequencies. To analyze the interference potential for these satellites, a simplified but conservative model was\nconstructed. A system of eleven uniformly spaced statellites, all with the\nrespective RF characteristics shown in Table 5-1, was postulated. These produce\na pattern of wanted and unwanted signal paths such as that depicted in Figure\n5-2. The contributions from all unwanted signal paths were combined into a\ntotal noise power value. Satellite spacing and ground antenna diameter were\nvaried parametrically to determine their effects on total noise power.

For the 60-foot diameter ground\nantennas currently being considered for domestic communications systems, satellites could be safely operated with a minimum spacing of 4.6 degrees longitude\nUse of larger, 97-foot ground antennas would reduce this spacing requirement\nto approximately 3.0 degrees. Thus, EMI contention poses a more serious constraint to geosynchronous operations than physical proximity. It requires\n4.6-degree spacing compared to 0.4 degree required for physical spacing.\nTo evaluate the nature and degree of physical and EMI contention which\ncould exist within the active satellite populations, additional satellite\ncharacteristics were defined and detailed distributions were established for\neach satellite type. An example of these distributions is presented in Figure\n5-4 which shows individual satellite locations and pertinent coverage bands\nfor 1990 traffic in the new traffic model. Satellites operating in different\nfrequency bands were interspersed in such a way as to maximize the spacing\nbetween satellites operating at the same frequency.

This procedure\nresulted in the widest spacing possible for potentially interfering satellites,\nHowever, closer physical spacing was induced between some configurations of\ndiffering bands than simple uniform distributions of all satellites within\ntheir respective coverage bands.\nThe resulting satellite spacing characteristics are summarized by zone\nin Tables 5-2 and 5-3 for the baseline and new traffic models, respectively.\nNowhere was the physical spacing criteria of 0.4 degree violated, even for\nthe high traffic levels predicted by 1990 in the new model. However, in all\nsix zones the high traffic levels in the new model severely violated the 4.6degree , C-band EMI spacing criteria defined above. Even the least crowded\nzones, 3 and 4, required 2.4 degrees spacing to fit all of the satellites\nwithin their coverage constraints. This exceeds the EMI spacing criteria by\na factor of nearly two. Other zones were even more critical.\nTable 5-2. 1990 Satellite Spacing for the Baseline Traffic Model\nZonal Spacings (degrees)\nTraffic Type\n\xd0\xa1- band communications\nrelay satellites\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7.5\n\n15\n\n15\n\nNo Cband\n\n6\n\n11\n\n8\n\n5.4\n\n30\n\n6\n\n3\n\n3\n\nS-band satellites\n\n7.5\n\nIT\n\nOverall physical proximity\n\n3.8\n\nNo Sband\nsat.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nsat\n\nTable 5-3. 1990 Satellite Spacing for the New Traffic Model\nZonal Spacings (degrees)\nTraffic Type\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nC-band communications\nrelay satellites\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\n2.0\n\n1.7\n\nS-band satellites\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\n9.5\n\n10.0\n\n8.5\n\n\xd0\xae.1\n\nOverall physical proximity\n\n0.75\n\n0.4\n\n]\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\nr2\n\n5-6\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n0.85\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nS-band traffic was sufficiently dispersed in both models that no interference between geosynchronous S-band satellites was predicted. It was determined, however, that S-band interference between geosynchronous satellites and\nsatellites in other orbits is likely, and would pose a problem in both traffic\nmodels. This was confirmed in discussions with SAMSO representatives on DoD\nplans for geosynchronous operations. S-band is used by both the NASA and DoD in\ntheir STDN and SGLS networks for operation of deep-space and low-earth orbit\nmissions as well as geosynchronous operations. Although the scope of this\nstudy was limited to geosynchronous missions, the geometric interrelationships\nwith S-band users in other orbits were recognized as sources of intermittent\ninterference. Coordination and cooperation between the NASA and DoD will be\nrequired in both the planning and "real-time" control of these missions.\nINACTIVE SATELLITE CONGESTION\n\nSince all satellites in geosynchronous orbits must employ east-west\nstationkeeping to control the effects of tesseral harmonic perturbations,\nonce they become inactive (either through failure or depletion of mission\nconsumables) and are without stationkeeping capability, they drift freely\nand are subject to perturbing influences which totally dictate their orbital\nmotion. Thus, orbit perturbations become the dominant factor in assessing\npotential physical contention among the inactive satellite populations.\nThe orbit perturbation effects interact to produce small altitude\ndeviations, particularly the tesseral harmonics and solar pressure. This,\ncoupled with the inclination excursions and nodal regression, results in a\ntotal "swept volume" of space approaching 3 x \xd0\xa2\xd0\x9e\xd0\xae nm3. This is illustrated\nby the shaded region in Figure 5-5. When the entire population of geosynchronous satellites projected to exist through the 1990 time period is applied to\nthis volume, extremely large average volumes per satellite results. Total\npopulations, including estimated foreign and DoD satellites, are 295 and 499\nfor the baseline and new traffic models, respectively. (These conservative\nfigures include both active and inactive satellites.; Average volumes\noccupied per satellite range from 60 x 106 nm3 to 100 x 106 nm3 for the new\nand baseline traffic models, respectively. These enormous volumes reduce the\npossibility of collision hazards to negligible levels.\nWhile average volume would be a true indication of collision probability\nonly for purely random comditions, it is felt to provide a strong indicator\nin this case, particularly in light of the magnitude involved. The year of\ninitial satellite placement, the placement location, and the residual conditions at the end of life, all interact with the perturbing forces to influence\nthe exact time histories of satellite motion during free drift. They all\nintroduce spreading effects on the individual satellites. While these factors\ndo not produce equal spacing effects, their overall influences are dispersive\nin nature. Thus, the average volume per satellite is felt to be an adequate\nmeasure of the collision hazard.\n\n5-7\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n11,400 n mi\n\nAh ayg = 18 n mi\n\nFigure 5-5. Total "Swept" Volume of Space Occupied by\nFree Drifting Geosynchronous Satellites\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe following principal conclusions and key study findings were derived\nfrom the orbit saturation analysis and its related traffic definitions.\n. The baseline traffic model-appears conservative, particularly\nduring the 1985-1990 time period, and does not pose serious\nphysical or EMI contention problems within the geosynchronous\nsatellites defined.\n. The new traffic model represents the full potential for geosynchronous operations. It is based on global demands and\nprovides increased utilitarian benefits to mankind. Satellite\nphysical spacing was found to be acceptable within the new\ntraffic model, but severe EMI interference was identified.\n. Overall, satellite physical contention is not likely to be a\ncritical problem through the 1990 time period, even without\nretrieval.\n. Geosynchronous EMI contention is likely to occur before 1990 if\nwider spectrum usage to reduce the number of satellites\noperating at the same frequency is not employed by communications\nrelay satellites.\n. S-band EMI problems currently exist among users in all orbits and\nwill be compounded by increased space traffic.\n. Cooperation and planning will be required on both national and\ninternational levels to preclude physical and EMI contention.\n5-8\nSO 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n6.0\n\nPLATFORM REQUIREMENTS AND CONCEPT SYNTHESIS\n\nThe operational, functional, and performance characteristics of the satellites that composed the traffic models were defined to establish a data base\nfor the derivation of two types of platforms: (1) multifunction and (2) single\nfunction or utility. The multifunction concept consisted of grouping nonrelated\nmission equipment into one orbital element. The utility concept was derived\nfrom a common support module that could be used by the discrete payloads of\nthe mission models for all support function (e.g., power, stability, data\nmanagement, etc.).\nOn-orbit servicing was a primary consideration in establishing the\nplatform and modular packaging concepts. Servicing of up to three platforms\nin a region by one shuttle-tug mission was considered to be practical.\nThree servicing modes (auto/remote, pressure suited, and shirtsleeve)\nwere evaluated. Platforms tailored for each servicing mode were considered,\nbut this approach appeared impractical. If within the span of ten years, the\nplatforms were replaced twice because of a change in the servicing mode, the\ntotal number of platforms would approximate the satellites in the traffic\nmodel. Also programmatic flexibility to vary the servicing mode would be quite\nlimited. In the preferred approach and configuration that was developed,\nthe initial platform structure placed on-orbit can be serviced by all three\nmodes. The only on-orbit modification required is to install a docking\nadapter to reduce a 7-foot-diameter opening, which is required for auto/remote\nservicing, to a standard tug-shuttle docking port for manned access.\nShirtsleeve servicing offers the greatest flexibility and capability\nto cope with maintenance, repair, and refurbishment activities, both planned\nand unplanned. Projected pressure suit technology indicates that a man in an\nEVA servicing mode can accomplish almost all of the activities that can be\nperformed in a shirtsleeve mode. Articulation device development, such as\nthat associated with the space shuttle manipulator, indicates that auto/remote\nservicing operations during the 1980\'s could approach the proficiency of\nmanned attendance for preplanned activities. However, it is highly probable\nthat servicing operations will become progressively more complex and less\nsubject to planning during the mission life of platforms. Therefore, an\nevolutionary on-orbit servicing approach appears to be highly desirable,\nand perhaps even a necessity.\nSubsystem trades were conducted to define an approach that would accommodate the entire range of required support. In some cases an incremental design\n.approach was defined which would permit addition/substitution of assemblies as\na function of the level of support required (e.g., solar arrays, batteries,\n\n6-1\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\npropellent, etc.). It was determined that the support system concepts were\nequally applicable to the multifunction platform approach and the discrete\npayload approach.\nThe derived platform configurations all utilized a series of toroids as\nthe basic structure. Inside changeout of replaceable modules was required to\nfacilitate shirtsleeve servicing operations.\nThree classes of multifunction platforms were developed: (1) data relay,\n(2) earth observation, and (3) astro-physics. One toroid ring on each of the\nplatforms was a common support module. Additional toroid rings were added to\nhouse the mission equipment of the three types of platforms.\nThe mission equipment for each of the data relay platforms could be\naccommodated within one toroid ring. The only significant difference between\ndata relay platforms was the complement of antennas and RF electronic equipment.\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the earth observation platform was\na 1.5-meter telescope, which was required to achieve adequate resolution of\nground targets from geosynchronous orbit. Three toroid rings were required to\nhouse the mission equipment associated with earth-observation activities.\nIncompatibilities in mission equipment and/or orientation resulted in the\ndefinition of four separate platforms for the astro-physics disciplines. They\nare stellar astronomy, solar astronomy, plasma physics, and high-energy physics.\nBoth astronomy platforms included telescopes, a complete toroid ring for\nmission equipment support functions, and a partial ring to house the equipment\nthat is directly associated with viewing through the telescopes. The plasma\nphysics platform required only one toroid ring for its mission equipment. Some\nof the mission equipment associated with the high-energy physics platform\n(total absorption counter, Cerenkov counter, and magnetic spectrometer) require\nunique installations. The length of the required mission equipment structure\nis about 15 feet, but only one toroid ring can be used to house mission equipment. A separate design is required for the remainder of the 15-foot structure.\nFUNCTIONAL GROUPING\nI\n\nThe analysis of the satellite inventories of the traffic models revealed,\nsome fundamental operational requirements that any equivalent platform concept\nwould have to meet. These requirements were:\n1.\n\nObservation of weather sources\n\n2.\n\nGlobal data relay capability\n\n3.\n\nMulti-path international data relay\n\n4.\n\nTransoceanic data relay\n\n5.\n\nInternational data relay via a single platform\n\n6-2\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n6.\n\nMaximum coverage of low earth orbiting satellites to a single\nground station\n\n7.\n\nFixed local vertical, scanning local vertical, or inertially\npointing orientations\n\nThe approach taken in the platform synthesis procedure was to assume that\nonly a single platform or space element was required. Additional elements\nwere identified only if the operational requirements so dictated.\nGUibal Coverage\nThe first five operational requirements all relate to plobal coverage\nfrom geosynchronous orbit. If a 5-degree mask or elevation angle is assumed,\nthen ground intercept contours for platforms located at 68\xc2\xb0 and 172\xc2\xb0E and\n6\xc2\xb0 and 110\xc2\xb0W longitude are as in Figure 6-1. All weather sources are covered;\nand the national, international, and transoceanic data relay requirements are\naccommodated with this four-platform concept.\n\n90\n\n60\n\n90E\n\n180\n\nREGION IV V5"\n\nREGION III\n\n90\n\n90E\n\nFigure 6-1.\n\nGlobal Coverage Regions\n\n6-3\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSolar Noise Outage\nDuring the vernal and autumnal equinox periods, a juxtaposition of the\nsun, platform, and a ground station will occur for several minutes a day over\nan approximate two-week interval. The noise density at the ground antenna\nincreases by approximately 85 dB during the juxtaposition period. This precludes communications from the platform.\nAdmittedly, the duration of noise outage is only of the order of six\nminutes (precise duration is dependent on orbit inclination and ground station\nlatitude), but it is still considered intolerable. In the 1980 time frame.it\nis predicted that a major portion of all communications will have become\ndependent upon geosynchronous orbit relay. A single platform per global region\nwould result in, for example, a main communications artery to/from Washington\nD.C. being disabled for about six minutes a day for four weeks a year. Clearly,\nthis situation would be unacceptable.\nInclusion of two data relay platforms in each global region spaced at\nleast 10 degrees apart in longitude can circumvent the solar noise outage\nproblem. Figure 6-2 illustrates the relative positions of the sun, platforms,\nand ground station. Note that only a discrete section of a global region is\naffected by the juxtaposition at any one time. The sun included angle is only\nabout 0.5 degree; the included angle from geosynchronous orbit to a 5-degree\nmask angle is 17.33 degrees.\nReallbcation of real-time data relay channels will permit the division\nof channel capacity between the two platforms in each region rather than\nduplication of the total regional requirements on each platform. When service\nto a particular ground station is interrupted by solar noise, the channels\naffected can be reassigned to other links. The channels servicing the other\nlinks from the second platform can, in turn, be assigned to the affected\nground station for the duration of the outage period.\nUnique Placement\nOperational requirement Number 6 imposes unique platform placement\nrequirements. The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TORS) system is designed\nto provide maximum coverage of low earth orbiting satellites via geosynchronous\norbit to a single ground station. Figure 6-3 illustrates parametrically the\ngeosynchronous element spacing and inclination as a function of the altitude\nof the low-orbiting element. To allow for north-south drift of the TORS elements, a spacing of 130\xc2\xb0 in longitude is recommended. Thus, all space elements\nabove an altitude of 700 nautical miles are capable of continuous communications\nvia TORS to a ground terminal.\nA candidate TORS concept locates the TORS elements at 11\xc2\xb0W and 141\xc2\xb0W\nlongitude. The single ground contact is at Rosman, North Carolina. The\ncones of exclusion at low altitudes with this TORS configuration are illustrated\nin Figure 6-4. Satellites within the region extending from about the middle\nof India to the middle of Australia at altitudes of 100 nautical miles or less\nwould not be within the line of sight of a TORS element.\n\n6-4\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n6-5\n\nSpace Division\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\n\xd0\xa8\n\nCM\n\n(\xd0\x9e\n\ns-\n\n+J\n13\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa8\nCD\n03\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xa8\n\xd0\xbe\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFINAL ORBIT\n^INCLINATION\n\nUSER\nALTITUDE\n\n102 NM\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\nNOT CONTINUOUS\n\nCONTINUOUS\n\nNOT CONTINUOUS\nTORS SPACING VS\nORBIT INCLINATION\nFOR CONTINUOUS GROUND\nSTATION VISIBILITY\n\nTORS SPACING VS\n.

Cones of Exclusion\n\n6-6\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nReduction of the longitudinal spacing of TORS elements to conform to the\napproximate 90-degree spacing of the data relay would result in an unacceptably\nlarge cone of exclusion of low-orbiting satellites. Therefore, TDRS platforms\ncan not be grouped with data relay platforms because of their unique placement\nrequirements.\nOrientation Considerations\nObservation of weather sources is only one role of the earth-observation\nclass of geosynchronous spacecraft. Earth resources survey, hydrology,\nmeteorology, etc., are also integral parts of this class. In order to obtain\nadequate resolution from a geosynchronous altitude, a telescope of the order\nof 1.5 meters is required. This, in turn, requires a local vertical scan\nthrough the 17-degree included angle from geosynchronous orbit. Global coverage requires a minimum of four platforms, but operationally they are not\ncompatible with data relay platforms. The data relay links require fixed\nlocal vertical pointing to within 0.2 degree. The earth observation platform\nmust scan through a 17-degree angle.\nAstronomy-space physics operations require the capability for 4\xd1\x82\xd1\x82\nsteradian pointing. Inertial hold for long durations (days) is mandatory.\nThis class of space elements is incompatible with both the data-relay and\nthe earth-observation functions. The relative size of the vehicles that\nhouse the various functions precludes any reasonable design that would\naccommodate dual orientations to the required accuracies (arc second/second\nstability for- earth observations and astro-physics payloads).\nDevelopmental Payloads\nSeveral of the payloads identified in the mission models for the 1980\'s\nconsisted of sensor/system concept evaluations. At this point in time, it\nis unrealistic to attempt to define these payloads to a level that might\npermit integration into a multifunction platform. In addition, grouping\nexperimental equipment with operational equipment that the world population\nhas become dependent upon is highly questionable because of the potential\nrisk factors, A more realistic approach is to design a developmental orbital\nfacility which would provide flexibility in both the mission equipment complement and operational capability. It may be feasible that the basic structure\nand support systems of the operational platforms could be used in the\ndevelopmental facility for as yet undefined developmental payloads. This is\nthe approach taken in this study.\nNavigational and Traffic Control\nThe new traffic model identified navigation aids to aircraft and ships,\nas well as traffic monitoring/communications functions. Also, coverage of\nthe polar routes was required. Therefore, a platform for each global region\nis inadequate to fulfill these requirements. One proposed concept is\nillustrated in Figure 6-5. A constellation of five satellites, one at\ngeostationary and four in inclined geosynchronous orbits, is required in each\nglobal region. Obviously the elements in the inclined orbits cannot be\ngrouped. The element at geostationary could be combined with a data relay\n6-7\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n0\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n20 40 60\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 4 0 1 6 0 1 8 8 1 6 0 1 4 0 1 2 0 1 0 0 8 0 60\n\n80 100 120 140 160 180160 140 120 100 80 60\n\nFigure 6-5.\n\n40\n\n20\n\n40\n\n20\n\nNacsat Platform Orbital Tracks\n\nplatform. However, because this element is essentially the same as those in\ninclined orbits, it was decided that there were fewer advantages to grouping\nthe geostationary functions. The primary comprison was:\n20 almost identical navigation and control platforms and the\ndata relay platforms\n\nand\n16 identical navigation and control platforms,\n4 combined navigation-traffic control/data relay platforms,\nand the remainder of the data relay platforms\nAlthough the latter concept requires four fewer elements, it would require\nthree development programs instead of the two required by the first alternative.\nIt is believed that the first approach would be more cost effective.\nSummary\n\nThe functional grouping analysis indicated that six types of platforms\nare required.

One concept accommodated auto/remote servicing; the other concept accommodated both pressure-suited\nand shirtsleeve servicing operations. Weights and volumes were estimated for\nthe ancillary equipment in order to establish the available payload weight for\nplatform module replacement. Manned servicing required a tandem tug concept\nbecause the crew module alone exceeded the roundtrip capability of a single\nstage tug.\nGross timelines for servicing operations in all three modes were developed.\nThe constraint on the operation was the seven-day mission duration limit of the\nspace shuttle model used in this study.\nAn evaluation of the feasibility of multi-platform visits on a single\nmission was conducted on the basis of mean weights of replaceable modules\nand a mean number of modules per platform. Within the limits of the model\nused, it was determined that a 25-percent replacement of the modules of three\nplatforms could be accomplished on a single mission. The first constraint\nreached in the auto/remote servicing mode was weight. Ample mission time\nwas available for the required module replacement operations. In the model\nused, it was assumed that two 8-hour shifts by ground controllers would be\nemployed. If need be, a third shift could be implemented. Conversely,\nfor the manned servicing modes, time was the first constraint reached; weight\nwas not as significant. Only a single crew (two or three men) was hypothesized\nfor on-orbit servicing. The dual tug configuration for manned attendance\nresults in a major increase in allowable payload weight.\nAncillary Equipment^\nThe baseline concept for interchange of platform modules in the auto/\nremote servicing mode consisted of a toroid ring(s) and a manipulator assembly.\nA second manipulator with a TV camera is also included. The concept is\nillustrated in Figure 6-6. Weight estimates of both one and two-tier concepts\nare listed in Table 6-2.\n\nFigure 6-6.

The baseline space shuttle used in this study was sized\nfor a seven-day mission. Nominal timelines for the entire servicing mission\nwere developed to establish any potential constraints. Twenty-four hours\nwere allocated for the initial and final phases of the mission (liftoff to\ntug-platform dock and tug-platform separation to touchdown, respectively).\nAlso, 24 hours were allocated for the 5-degree orbit transfer between\nplatforms. Thus, the total times available for servicing platforms based\nupon a seven-day mission are:\nOne platform\nTwo platforms\nThree platforms\n\n120 hours\n96 hours\n72 hours\n\nA step-by-step operational sequence for platform module interchange was\ndeveloped for each of the three servicing modes.

Mean weights and numbers\nof replaceable modules for the platforms were used. Figure 6-9 illustrates\nthe capabilities. All three modes can accommodate a three-platform, 25-percent\nmodule interchange mission. .A 50-percent interchange can be effected on a\ndual- or two-platform servicing mission.

Auto/remote servicing time was based\non two 8-hour shifts for ground controllers. If in practice the time limit\nshould present a problem, it could be resolved (with some shuttle payload\npenalties) by extending the on-orbit stay time of the shuttle.\nThe apparent weight constraint associated with the auto/remote servicing\nmode is indicative of the single tug logistics concept. The weight capability\nfor tandem tug-dual shuttle launch operations comparable to the manned servicing mode is also indicated on Figure 6-9. Only a three-platform servicing\nmission would be efficient for a dual tug-auto/remote configuration.\nServicing Mode Limitations\nAlthough a platform could be optimally designed for each servicing mode,\nall three modes have inherent practical limitations. Shirtsleeve servicing\nprovides the greatest flexibility in operations. Unanticipated problems can\nbe more readily resolved; repairs to a much lower level of assembly can be\naccomplished; and hardware, including the wire harness, can be refurbished.\nThe limitation to shirtsleeve servicing is that it cannot accommodate the\nreplacement/repair of platform appendages that cannot be enclosed in a\npressurizable environment. The EVA servicing mode alleviates the problem of\nplatform appendage servicing, but the lack of dexterity and restriction of\nmovement in a pressure suit preclude some operations that man can accomplish\nin a shirtsleeve mode. The principal advantage of the auto/remote concept is\nthe removal of man from a hazardous environment. Also, only a single shuttle/\ntug flight is required for the servicing mission. However, the major disadvantage to auto/remote servicing is the relative inflexibility for contingencies and unexpected problems.\nThe projected technology associated with pressure suits indicates that\nduring the 1980\'s, a pressure-suited man will be able to accomplish from 90 to\n95 percent of the activities that a man can perform in a shirtsleeve environment. The small delta could be the difference between on-orbit refurbishment\nof a platform instead of replacement of the space element. The primary\ndifference between platform designs for EVA and shirtsleeve modes would be a\npressure shell, required for the shirtsleeve mode, which would increase the\nplatform weight by approximately 200 pounds. The impact on the servicing\nsystem would be the delta equipment for storage and control of the atmosphere\nfor making the platform habitable, the servicing system weight increasing by\nabout 50 pounds. Storage volume requirements increase less than one cubic foot.\nThe advancing technology associated with articulation devices such as\nthe space shuttle manipulator indicate that it would be feasible to accomplish\nmodular assembly replacement by remote control. More complex operations could\nalso be accomplished if adequately defined and an appropriate manipulator end\neffector and force feedback control system were developed. However, the\nproblem is to identify such operations as platform repair and/or refurbishment in time to permit the necessary development. It should be noted that the\nmore complex the auto/remote operation, the more significant is the 0.1-second\ncommunication time delay between geosynchronous orbit and a ground control\n\n6-15\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nstation. The principal advantage associated with the auto/remote concept is\nthe simplification of the logistics system, since only a single tug/shuttle is\nrequired. Both man-attendance modes require dual tug/dual shuttle operations.\nIt appears that an evolutionary servicing concept is appropriate for a\nplatform program. Initial module replacement can be achieved by the auto/\nremote concept. As the platform program progresses, repairs and refurbishment\nwill probably be required and more complex and intricate operations will be\nnecessary. This type of activity is more amenable to man attendance. Further,\nthe projected development of the tug supports the evolutionary concept. Initial\nIOC of the shuttle and unmanned tug supports the early phase of on-orbit\nservicing of platforms at the modular interchange level. Approximately five\nyears after initiation of platform operations, a man-rated tug is planned.\nThis timing would support potential refurbishment of platforms utilizing the\nshirtsleeve mode.\nSUBSYSTEMS AND PACKAGING\n\nOne of the prime drivers in the selection and synthesis of subsystems and\npackaging concepts was the desire for maximum commonality across all platforms.\nIt is believed that one of the keys to a cost-effective space program is a\nreduction in customized design approaches for each space element and repair/\nresupply/refurbishment/reuse of space elements. The approach taken in this\nstudy was to select the design concept that satisfied the most stringent performance requirements and facilitated both auto/remote and man attendance\non-orbit servicing.\nSupport Requirements\nThe performance requirements of the individual satellites of the traffic\nmodels and gross platform concepts were analyzed to establish the operating\nranges that a common support module would be required to accommodate. In\nselected cases, performance plateaus were also defined. Although the main\nemphasis was to establish a singular concept for each support function, the\nquantity of a particular type platform requiring a less stringent capability\n(and thus less costly equipment) may justify a separate development. Table 6-6\nsummarizes the performance ranges.\nThe performance plateaus that were specified for concept development\nwere as follows:\nElectrical power system\n\n500; 1000; 1500; 2000 watts\n\nAttitude stabilization and control\nPointing\n0.1 degree; 0.1 arc second\nStability\n0.1 degree/sec; 0.1 arc second/\nsecond\nPropulsion\nOrientation\n\n12,000 Ib-sec; 19,000 Ib-sec\nFixed local vertical; inertial\n\n6-16\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 6-6.

Both the solar arrays and the battery pack are\nreplaceable modules, and various power capacity designs could be structurally\ninterchangeable. The preferred attitude stabilization and control concept\nvaries significantly between performance levels. The less stringent requirements are associated with data relay platforms, which require a fixed local\nvertical orientation. On the basis of current technology-developed hardware,\na two-reaction, wheel-momentum, bias-horizon scanner is preferred. The more\nstringent requirements, coupled with inertial orientation, dictates a 3-reaction\nwheel system and star trackers. The two concepts/assemblies are not readily\ninterchanged.\nElectrical Power Subsystem (EPS^\nDesign concepts for the three major functions of the EPS were evaluated.\nA synopsis of the alternates is shown in Figure 6-10.\nThe preferred power generation concept was solar arrays. The selection\nwas based upon relative cost, weight, and availability of hardware. For\nexample, an advanced solar array will yield more than four times as much\nwattage per pound than either the radioisotope or nuclear concepts.\nConsideration of the servicing modes also favored the solar array concept.\nBecause manned servicing is included, significant increases in shield weight\nand safety features are required with either the nuclear or radioisotope\nconcept.\n\n6-17\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSOLAR\nPOWER\nGENERATION\n\nRADIOISOTOPE\n\nNUCLEAR\n\nBATTERIES\n\nEPS\n\nREGENERATIVE\nFUEL CELLS\n\nENERGY\nSTORAGE\n\nFLY WHEELS\n\nSERIES\nREGULATION\nPOWER\nCONDITIONING\nSHUNT\nREGULATION\n\nFigure 6-10. EPS Concept Trades\nThe selected energy storage concept was NiCd batteries. Because of the\nnature (duration and frequency) of the eclipse periods of a geosynchronous\nplatform, it is believed that batteries can be effectively used for long mission\ndurations. The depth of discharge and discharge cycles at geosynchronous orbit\nare significantly less than at low earth orbit.\nThe other two candidate concepts, regenerative fuel cells and fly wheels,\nare classed as emerging technologies. The fly wheel concept consists of an\nintegrated power and attitude control system (IPACS). During the sunlight\nportion of the orbit,solar array power is used by an electric motor to increase\nthe speed of a fly wheel that is part of a control moment gyro assembly. During\neclipse periods, energy is taken from the wheel to operate a generator to supply\npower to the loads. Depending upon the rate of development, either one of\nthese alternates could be preferred by the 1980\'s. Both concepts have higher\nwatt-hour/pound ratings than batteries. However, the uncertainty in component\n\n6-18\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\ndevelopment for these two concepts for long-duration missions and the potentially\nhigher costs precluded their selection.\nThe series regulation concept has been and is being used on many space\nelements. Its primary disadvantage is the 10 to 15 percent power losses\nincurred by channeling all of the\'load power through the regulator. A shunt\nregulator approach, the direct energy transfer concept, is currently being\nconsidered for advanced communication satellites. It includes a central\ncontrol that modulates the operation of a shunt regulator, battery charge\nregulators, and a battery discharge regulator. Continuously regulated power\nis provided without an in-line conditioning element. Bus voltage regulation\nof +. 1.0 percent (28 volts bus) is readily obtainable. The reduced weight\nand higher efficiency of the direct energy transfer concept are the primary\nreasons for its selection as the preferred approach.\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command Subsystem (TT&C)\nThe most significant trade study conducted for TT&C functions was that\nassociated with the carrier frequency used for data transfer between ground\nstations and platforms. Use of S-band (2.1 to 2.3 GHz) for this function has\nseen the approach in the vast majority of the space programs for a decade.\nWorldwide S-band ground terminals have been established for low-orbit\nsatellite programs. These same stations could be used for geosynchronous platforms also. However, just the predicted increase in low-orbit satellite traffic\nwill severely tax the capacity of the S-band system. Only a single ground\nterminal is required for data transfer to/from geosynchronous platforms; it is\nnot mandatory that the link be compatible with the current worldwide S-band\nsys tern.\nThe majority of the geosynchronous platforms are data relay types.\nBecause of mission equipment bandwidth requirements, C- and K-band frequencies\nare used. It is anticipated that the user ground station would perform the\nstatus-monitoring as well as the payload-utilization function. In order to\nmaximize the commonality of both platform and ground station equipment, either\na C- or K-band TT&C carrier frequency is preferred. The increasing demand for\nchannels and thus bandwidth will probably result in K-band mission equipment\non all data relay platforms. Since the beamwidth at K-band is smaller than\nthe beamwidth at C-band for the same antenna size, K-band is preferred. The\nnarrower beam will reduce potential interference with other ground stations.\nUp-command communication link calculations were made for both S-band and\nK-band TT&C systems. Although the K-band system requires 14.5 times the power\nof the S-band system for the same performance margin, the level is only about\n500 milliwatts. Thus the K-band system was selected for TT&C purposes to\nmaximize commonality of equipment and minimize RF interference problems.\nAttitude Stabilization and Control Subsystem (ASCS)\nThe key elements of an ASCS are the torque-source and attitude-reference\nassemblies. The low-disturbance torques encountered at geosynchronous orbit\nsuggest momentum storage/transfer system (MSTS) concepts as a prime candidate\nfor cyclical torques.\nSlew rates for the platforms are relatively low\n\n6-19\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n(0.1 degree/second), so that reaction wheels are applicable. Secular\ntorques plus stationkeeping requirements establish the necessity also\nfor an auxiliary propulsion system.\nFor attitude determination, sun, stellar, horizon, and inertial sensing\ninstruments are available. However, platform control necessitates a moderate\nbandpass requirement, and many of the potential combinations of sensors and\ntorques require an inertial reference system (gyros) also. Depending upon the\ncontrol accuracies required, integrated ASCS concepts are available that preclude a separate attitude reference assembly.\nThree types of platforms that have distinct ASCS requirements were evaluated: (1) data relay, (2) earth observation, and (3) astro-physics. The datarelay platform had the least stringent requirements, and thus the simplest\nsystem was selected as the preferred concept. It consists of a "T" momentum\nbias configuration in which an earth horizon sensor is scanned by the\nmomentum bias wheel. The earth-observation platform is subjected to the most\nsevere disturbance torque environment and has the most stringent cyclic\nmaneuver requirements. However, its near local vertical orientation also\npermits the use of a momentum bias concept, a two-degree-of-freedom gimbaled\nreaction wheel. Performance accuracies require a star tracker system for\nattitude determination. The variable inertial orientations associated with\nastro-physics platforms result in the requirement for a conventional triad\nmomentum wheel configuration for the MSTS. A star tracker concept is also\nrequired for this type of platform to achieve the required pointing accuracies.\nA comparison of the ASCS concepts for the three types of platforms is\npresented in Table 6-7. Although the concept for the astro-physics platform\nwould be rated lowest in all categories, it is the only one of the three that\nis applicable to all three platforms.\nThe difference between the astro-physics and earth observation platform\nASCS concepts can be attributed to the additional reaction wheel required for\nthe former platform. The relatively low cost of the data relay ASCS concept\nreflects the off-the-shelf availability of horizon scanners and the integral\npackaging of the momentum wheels and the scanner. This could be misleading\nfor two reasons: (1) complexity of installation in a platform, and (2) inprocess development of change-coupled device (CCD) star trackers.\nInclusion of a horizon scanner in a standardized platform concept presents\nsome unique problems. All the sensors (antennas) associated with data relay\nplatforms are earth pointing. The associated electronics hardware should be\nlocated as close as practical to the antennas to reduce line losses. Thus a\nsupport function (ASCS) would be intermingled with mission equipment in order\nto also achieve earth viewing. The ASCS could not be located in a common\nsupport module unless the horizon sensor was \xe2\x80\xa2 extended on a boom beyond the\nmoldline of the platform.\n\n6-20\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 6-7.\n\nASCS Concept Comparisons\n\nEstimated\n\nMission\n\nSystem\n\nAverage Peak\nRelative\nWeight\nPower Power\nCost\nMb) (\'Mvatts) (\'watts)\n(X)\n\nData relay\n\n"T" momentum bias\n& wheel-scanned\nhorizon sensing\n\n66\n\n45\n\n236\n\n43.7\n\nEarth observati on*\n\nTwo-degree-offreedom gimbaled\nmomentum wheel &\n\n105\n\n62\n\n296\n\n96.5\n\nThree orthogonal\n149\n80\nreaction wheels &\nstrapdown star\nsensors\n*System also accommodates data relay requirements\n\n406\n\n100.0\n\nstrapdown star\nsensors\n\nAstro-physics**\n\n**Compatible with requirements of all missions\nThe CCD is essentially a solid-state digital imaging sensor, its\ntechnology is emerging and may have applications in commercial television.\nPrototype hardware has been developed, and system feasibility studies have\nbeen conducted. The primary factor in the higher estimated costs for the\nearth observation and astro-physics ASCS concepts is the uncertainty of the\noperational status of the CCD concept. Current interest in the devices\ncould accelerate their development to the point that they would be cost\ncompetitive with horizon scanners.\nThis concept was selected as the preferred control system approach for\ngeosynchronous platforms on the basis of the universal applicability of the\ntriad reaction wheel-CCD ASCS concept and the potential low-cost availability\nof the CCD\'s.\nPlatform impulse requirements range from 10K to 20K Ib-sec. For the\nrequirements range, a monopropellant hydrazine concept was selected over cold\ngas or earth storable liquid propellents on the basis of system weight, cost,\nexisting technology, and ease in propellent handling. The maximum propellent\nrequirement was established by the astro-physics platforms (82 pounds). Two\ndiametrically opposite modules, with eight 1-pound-thrust engines each, could\nprovide the necessary momentum dump, orientation, and stationkeeping maneuvers.\nThe structural concept for the common support module will accommodate up\nto four propulsion modules. The initial concept for data relay platforms did\nnot include a requirement for north-south stationkeeping.\n(It has not been\nestablished that this is a firm operational requirement.) But by including the\ntwo additional propulsion modules, up to 2.5 years of north-south stationkeeping\n\n6-21\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nof data relay platforms can be accomplished before propellent replenishment is\nrequired. Analyses in other non-related studies that pertained to ground\nstation concepts indicated a strong preference for north-south stationkeeping\nof data relay elements. On the basis of this preference and the potential\nincrease in reliability and mission duration, the four-propellant module\napproach was selected for the common support module.\nFigure\nis a hinged\nestablished\nreplacement\n\n6-11 illustrates the propulsion module concept. Also illustrated\nengine assembly cover. Upon closing the cover, a pressure seal is\naround a cutout in the basic structure. Shirtsleeve maintenance/\nis thus feasible from within the support module.\n\nFigure 6-11. Reaction Control System Concept\n\nThermal Control Subsystem (TCS)\nThe structural configuration of geosynchronous platforms directly affects\nthe selection of the TCS concept. Shirtsleeve maintenance requires a pressurizable structure and inside changeout of modules. Thus, a heat transport system to conduct the heat from a module to an external radiator is required. A\nheat pipes system was selected for two reasons: (1) it is a passive system\nand thus highly reliable, and (2) the design concept can readily accommodate\nlarge power (thermal) turndown ratios. Although data relay platforms will\noperate at full power almost continuously, both earth observation and astrophysics platforms will operate cyclically at power levels ranging from as low\nas 100 watts to as high as 2000 watts.\n\n6-22\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nOne minor problem associated with on-orbit changeout of modules is\nmaking and breaking the thermal interface between the module and the IPS\ncol dpi ate. The recommended approach was to include a thermal grease packet\nin the coldplate interface for all modules requiring greater than 100 watts\npower dissipation. Upon installation of the module the packet is crushed and\nthe thermal connection is adequately established.\nA radiator area of approximately 22 square feet (in two sections) is\nrequired for the common support module and the mission equipment rings for the\ndata relay platforms. The power dissipation requirements of the mission equipment rings for earth observation and astro-physics platform vary considerably.\nThe largest radiator requirement was for one of the equipment rings for the\nearth observation platform; it required 72 square feet of radiator. The\nstructural concept can readily accommodate two 36-square-foot panels.\n\nEnvironmental Control Subsystem (ECS)\nInclusion of ECS provisions in a geosynchronous platform was evaluated.\nBecause of the potentially long duration (years) between servicing visits and\nthe ECS capabilities of a manned tug, it was deemed to be impractical to include ECS equipment as part of the platform.\nThe delta manned tug ECS requirements to facilitate shirtsleeve servicing\nof platforms were defined. Table 6-8 summarizes these requirements. Pressure\ntanks and the air supply are expressed parametrically because they both are a\nfunction of the number of platforms that will be visited on a servicing mission.\nIn order to provide service mission flexibility without penalizing the basic\ntug, it was recommended that all ECS equipment (especially the pressure tanks)\nassociated with making the platform habitable be installed in the storage compartments of the servicing unit, instead of in the basic tug ECS subsystem.\nTable 6-8.

The one guideline\nof this study that makes the configuration definition unique is the requirement\nfor an evolutionary concept that will progressively accommodate auto/remote,\npressure-suited, and shirtsleeve servicing. The most practical configuration\nfor shirtsleeve operations in an orbiting space element is a cylinder. The\nmaximum diameter of the element must be compatible with the space shuttle\ncargo bay -- 15 feet. Interchange of modules must be accomplished from the\ninterior in the shirtsleeve servicing mode. Auto/remote servicing could be\naccomplished by various articulation devices. Cartridge-type mechanisms\ncould be used for external changeout. Manipulators similar to those of the\nspace shuttle could be used for either inside or outside changeout. No\nspecial structural provisions other than restraints were identified for\npressure-suited operations.\nAn evolutionary concept can be one that minimizes design changes as a\nprogram progresses; either the basic unit is updated or replaced with the\nupdated configuration. The evolution of servicing modes was assumed to occur\nthrough the 1980\'s. But one of the prime drivers for on-orbit servicing is\nto extend the usable life of a space element up to ten years. Therefore, the\napproach for this study was to define a platform configuration that could be\nadapted on-orbit to the three servicing modes. Replacement of the basic space\nelement was not considered to be an acceptable solution.\nSince conversion from a non-pressurizable to a pressurizable volume on\norbit was determined to be impractical, the preferred shape of the platform\nconfiguration was cylindrical. Also, inside changeout of modules was required.\nAuto/remote servicing of inside changeout modules imposed requirements for\nclearance and articulation of the manipulator and attached modules. An\nunencumbered 7-foot-diameter volume in the center was selected for the interchange operation.\nConsideration of appendages (jets, hinge points, rolled-up solar arrays)\nand module sizes indicated that a reasonable compromise for the outside\ndiameter of the platform structure was 12 feet. This size allowed a 1.5-foot\nclearance in the shuttle cargo bay and accommodated 12 radially mounted\nreplaceable modules 24 by 20 by 24 inches. The resulting toroid configuration\nof the basic platform structure is illustrated in Figure 6-12.\nStandardized modular packaging was selected to simplify the replacement\noperation. If all modules are the same size, then the servicing unit needs\nonly one empty storage compartment at mission initiation. Customized packaging would require either two manipulators, a temporary holding fixture, or\nmultiple empty storage compartments that would be resized for each specific\nmission. Also, one more opportunity for potential cost savings from commonality\nwould be forfeited.\n\n6-24\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nFigure 6-12. Basic Platform Structural Configuration\nReplaceable Module Packaging\n\nConceptual design of each of the support system assemblies was performed\nto establish their physical characteristics. Grouping of subassemblies\nwas based upon servicing considerations, volumetric requirements, power dissipation, and interface complexity. The resultant grouping and the rationale\nfor it are presented in Table 6-9.\nA total of 12 replaceable subsystem modules are identified. The data\nprocessing and tracking/telemetry assemblies are packaged in one module, referred\nto as the central processor. Included in the 12 modules are the two attitude\ncontrol or propulsion modules that are in excess of the basic requirements as\nexplained in the preceding attitude stabilization and control description.\nAll of the assemblies can fit in the standard 24 by 20 by 24-foot modular\nenvelope.

The mission equipment provisions for these\nplatforms were analyzed for both traffic models.\n\n6-28\nSD 73-5A-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nData Relay Platforms\nIncluded in the general category of data relay platforms are the\nComsat (Intelsat), Domsat, Traffic Control, Navigation, and TORS satellites.\nComsat, Domsat, and traffic control functions identified in the baseline\ntraffic model can be grouped. The navigation functions identified in the\nnew traffic model require unique placement of geosynchronous elements and\ncan be grouped only with the traffic control functions of the new traffic\nmodel. The TORS function is the same for both traffic models. Foreign as\nwell as United States TORS elements are reflected in the new traffic model.\nUnique geosynchronous element placement is required to maximize the coverage\nof low-earth-orbiting space elements and to provide a data relay link to a\nsingle ground station within a specific country. In the new traffic model,\nthe international data relay function was referred to as Intelsat rather\nthan Comsat. This function could be grouped with the Domsat function, but\nthe projected data transfer requirements of the new traffic model required\nmultiple platforms because of frequency spectrum (bandwidth) limitations.\nBecause both functions require wide area coverage, which is a characteristic\nof the C-band frequency, it was decided that a more efficient platform network\ncould be synthesized by incorporating only the Domsat or Intelsat function\nin any single platform. In this manner, C-band use can be maximized for\nboth functions with minimum RF equipment complexity.\nIn order to provide worldwide Comsat, Domsat, and traffic control data\nrelay capability commensurate with the satellites of the baseline traffic\nmodel, four global regions were defined. The centroids of the regions are\n6\xc2\xb0W, 110\xc2\xb0W, 68\xc2\xb0E, and 172\xc2\xb0E longitude. The first region encompasses Europe,\nAfrica, the Middle East, Atlantic Ocean, and South America. The second\nregion includes all of the Western Hemisphere. The third region provides\ncoverage of Africa, the Indian Ocean, and the majority of Asia. The fourth\nregion includes eastern Asia and the Pacific Ocean. The regions were selected\nto maximize contiguous single platform coverage for all nations and single\nplatform links between any two countries. The only exceptions to the selection criteria are the links between Central and South America to the East\nAsian nations.\nThe satellites of the baseline traffic model were analyzed to establish\nthe data relay channel requirements for each global region. Table 6-11 summarizes the requirements. Two platforms were "required as a minimum in each\nregion in order to avoid solar outage of a ground station-platform link.\nTherefore, the regional requirements were equally divided between two platforms.\nThe selected transponder complement for each platform is also listed in\nTable 6-11. The capacities of the platform in Regions II, III, and IV are\ngreater than the minimum requirements. A commonality in assemblies is\nreflected; for example, 12 channels of C-band are readily grouped into\none assembly. Development of a unique 6-channel transponder for Region II\nwas not considered to be an economical approach.\n\n6-29\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 6-11.

L-band was used as the carrier\nfrequency. An 8.75 by 8.75-foot phased array was selected as the antenna for\nthe platform. The concept will transfer 250 Kbps of data and is compatible\nwith existing TACAN equipment currently used by commercial aircraft.\nFigure 6-14 illustrates the Comsat/Domsat/traffic control platforms for\neach region. The platform weights and power requirements are also identified\non the figure.\nThe channel requirements for each region that are commensurate with the\nnew traffic model in the year 1990 are listed in Table 6-12. The maximum\nnumber of channels that can be accommodated on a single platform without frequency reuse are 216 (24 C-band, 24 K[_o-band, and 168 \xd0\x9a\xd1\x89-band). Orthogonal\npolarization of alternate channels is included in the totals to compensate for\nthe overlap of the passband of adjacent carrier frequencies in each band.\nThus, in Region I a minimum of four Domsat and two Intelsat platforms are\nrequired. Region II requires a minimum of six Domsat and two Intelsat platforms. A minimum of five Domsat and two Intelsat platforms are required in\nRegion III. No Intelsat requirements were defined for Region IV, but at least\nfour Domsat platforms are required in this region.\nThe implementation concept is also listed in Table 6-12. The Domsat\nplatforms for Regions II, III, and IV have a larger capacity than their respective aggregate requirements. However, to maximize the commonality of\nassemblies standardized 12-channel, 24-channel, and 84-channel C, KLO, and \xd0\x9a\xd1\x89band transponders were utilized. Intelsat requirements were accommodated by\nusing only C- and \xd0\x9a\xd1\x89-band transponders. The apparent 48-channel shortage in\nRegion II Intelsat capacity can be alleviated either by using the surplus 48\nchannels in the Domsat platform of Region II or reuse of frequencies in widely\nseparated \xd0\x9a\xd1\x89-band beams.\n\n6-30\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nROLL UP\nSOLAR ARRAY\n/(2 PLACES)\n\n^.^^\n( Y^\n\nC-BAND\n\nANTENNA\n(3 PLACES)\n\nC-BAND MODUL\n\nKHI-BAND MODULE/x\xe2\x80\x94_\n\n- BAND ANTENNA (2 PLACES)\n\nL-BAND MODUL\n\nL-BAND MODULE^ V\n\n:CTION A-A\nL-BAND\nPHASED\nARRAY\n\nMISSION\'\nEQUIPMENT\nRIN6\n\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT\nMODULE\n\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\n\nWEIGHT\n(LB)\n\n770\n\nC-BAND ANTENNA\n(4 PLACES)\n\n600\n\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT MODULE\n\n1989\n\n218\n\n2759\n\n818\n\nTT&C ANTENNA\n\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\n\nRING\n\nL-BAND\nPHASED ARRAY\n\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT\nU MODULE\n\n1285\n\n1080\n\n1989\n\n218\n\nTOTAL\n\nREGION III DATA RELAY PLATFORM\n\nC-BAND MODULES\n\n3274\n\n1298\n\nK^-BAND ANTENNA (2 PLACES)\n\nC-BAND ANTENNA (2 PLACES)\nKLO-BAND ANTENNA (2 PLACES)^\n\nC-BAND SHAPED ANTENNA\nL-BAND MODULE\n\nPOWER\n(WATTS)\n\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT MODULE\n\nREGION I DATA RhLAY PLATFORM\n\nA\n\nWEIGHT\n(LB)\n\nSECTION A-A\n\nTOTAL\n\n\xd0\xa2\xd0\x93&\xd0\xa1 ANTENNA\n\nC-BAND MODULE\n\nPOWER\n(WATTS)\n\nKLQ-BAND MODULE:\n\nK UT BAND MODULE\n\nHI\n\nL-BAND MODULE\nC-BAND MODULES\n\n5ECTION A-A\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\nC-BAND\nANTENNA\n(4PLACES\n\nTT&C ANTENNA\n\nL-BAND\nPHASED ARRAY\n\n>\n\nRING\n\nF4\nJjl\n1/\n\nSUPPORT\nMODULE\n\nWEIGHT\n(LB)\n\nPOWER\n(WATTS)\n\nWEIGHT\n(LB)\n\nSECTION A-A\n\n997\n\n1200\n\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT MODULE\n\n1989\n\n218\n\nTOTAL\n\n2986\n\n1418\n\nPOWER\n(WATTS)\n\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT MODULE\nC-BAND ANTENNA\n(3 PLACES)\n\nREGION II DATA RELAY PLATFORM\n\n1989\n\n218\n\nTOTAL\n\nTT&C ANTENNA\n\n1846\n\n3835\n\n1723\n\nREGION IV DATA RELAY PLATFORM\nFigure 6-14.

The specific complement of antennas varies from region\nto region because of the geographic variations. Also, KLo-band equipment is\nincluded only in the Domsat platforms. The nominal power and weight characteristics of the platforms are also indicated on the figure.\nThe simplest mechanization would be to pre-assign specific channels to\nspecific links. But this approach is not considered realistic. Accurately\npredicting traffic demands five to ten years in advance is not feasible. Also,\nfluctuations in daily business and the occurrence of special events, such as\nthe Olympic games, could significantly alter the required channel assignments.\nTherefore, a channel reallocation technique that can be accomplished in real\ntime via ground command was incorporated in all Domsat and Comsat/Intelsat\nplatforms. Any channel within a frequency band can be switched to any antenna\nof that band.\nIn order to minimize the microwave connections that will be interrupted\nduring on-orbit servicing operations, the transponder chain for a frequency\nband set including the switching matrix was packaged within one replaceable\nmodule. No problems were encountered in packaging the transponder chains for\nthe baseline traffic model platform equivalents. However, some of the Domsat\nand Intelsat platform equivalents of the new traffic model required up to 16\n\xd0\x9a\xd1\x89-band antennas. For the proposed channel reallocation flexibility, an\n84 by 16 microwave switching matrix is required. In this case, the total\ntransponder assembly measured 25 W by 20 H by 36 inch D. Thus the assembly\nprotrudes 12 inches into the 7-foot-diameter center of the toroid ring. By\ninstalling the \xd0\x9a\xd1\x89-band transponder assemblies in compartments that are 60\ndegrees apart, adequate clearance is maintained for chanqeout in the most\ncritical mode, auto/remote servicing.\n\n6-33\nSD 73-5A-0036-2\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n- BAND MODULES\nKHI - BAND ANTENNAS\n(8 PLACES)\n- BAND ANTENNA\n(3 PLACES)\nC-BAND ANTENNA\n(2 PLACES)\n\n- BAND MODULE\n\nC-BAND MODULE\nSECTION \xd0\x90-\n\nC-BAND SHAPED ANTENNA\n(3 PLACES)\n\nCOMMON SUPPORT MODULE\nWEIGHT\n(LB)\n\nMISSION EQUIPMENT RING\n\nPOWER\n(WATTS)\n\nMISSION\nEQUIPMENT\nCOMMON\nSUPPORT MODULE\n\n2016\n1989\n\n218\n\nTOTAL\n\n4005\n\n1603\n\nFigure 6-15.

In essence, the\nplatform is a repackaging of the mission equipment of the satellite to facilitate\non-orbit servicing and the replacement of the customized support equipment with\nthe common support module.\nThe navigation and traffic control platforms corresponding to the satellites of the same name in the new traffic model are illustrated in Figure 6-17.\nThis platform also consists of a repackaging of the satellite mission equipment and the use of the common support module.\nThe definition of the mission equipment for the earth resource, meteorology,\nand astronomy satellites of the baseline traffic model was inadequate for\ngrouping analyses. As part of the synthesis procedures representative series\nof earth observation and astronomy-physics payloads was defined. The payloads\nwere based upon space station experiments, low-altitude satellites, and the\nNASA "Blue Book" of space science experiments. Scaling factors were used to\nadjust from low altitude to geosynchronous orbit. A total of 22 payloads was\ndefined.\nThe operational requirements and mission equipment characteristics of\neach payload were analyzed to determine reasonable groupings. All of the earth\nviewing payloads were grouped on an earth observational platform, shown in\nFigure 6-18. Four such platforms are required to obtain the required global\ncoverage. The primary assembly of the platform is the 1.5-meter telescope,\nwhich.is required to achieve acceptable resolution of ground targets. Two\nmission equipment rings are required. The ring on the +Z axis contains those\nsensors that view the earth directly. Sensors requiring the resolution and\nnarrow field of view of the telescope are mounted in the ring on the -Z axis.\nThe common support module and the direct viewing equipment ring serve as a\nsun shade for the telescope.\nFour astro-physics platforms were required because of incompatibilities\nof mission equipment and/or required sensor orientations. The four are:\nsolar astronomy, stellar astronomy, plasma physics, and high-energy physics,\nas illustrated in Fiqures 6-19, 6-20, 6-21, and 6-22. The new traffic\nmodel included both foreign and U. S. astro-physics geosynchronous elements.\nBecause of the lack of definition of the equipment of the foreign satellites,\nthe approach taken was to assume that the foreign astro-physics mission\nequipment would be essentially the same as the U.S. equipment. Thus, the\nastro-physics platforms for foreign nations are identical to those synthesized\nfor the U.S. space program.\nCONCLUSION\nIt is feasible and reasonable to group the functions of several geosynchronous satellites in a single, on-orbit serviceable platform. One platform configuration can accommodate auto/remote, EVA, and shirtsleeve servicing.\nThat configuration, a toroid, can be utilized for both support function\nmission-equipment assemblies.\n\n6 37\n\n\'\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n6-38\n\n\xd0\xbe: \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x88 1\xe2\x80\x94\n0\xc2\xab=\xd0\xa1\n\xd0\xbe. 2\n\n\xd0\xacCD CQ\ni\xe2\x80\x94i 1\nLU\n\nSpace Division\n\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e\n\nCM\n\n00\n\n**\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n3\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n<\xc2\xa3>\n\nCL\n\n(\xd0\x9e\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nCM\n\n01\nCO\ncr>\n\nCM\n\nUD\n\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb7\n\n1\n\nLU\n\n\xd0\xbe \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xb3 \xd0\x81\xd0\x95\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n210.\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\nQ\n\ni i QCO i\xe2\x80\x94i\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\nz\n2: \xd0\xa8\n\xd0\xbe s:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xd1\x87 \xd0\xa1\xd0\xa3\n21 UJ\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\nI\n\xd0\xbe.\n\nL\n\n\xd0\x9e \xd0\xa8\n\n6-39\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\xd0\x9e.\nD.\n1\n3\n\n1/1\nJ\nJ\n1\n\n\xd0\xbe ^c\n\n\xd0\x9e\xd0\x93\xd0\xae\nUXI\xe2\x80\x94\n\nO_ 2\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\nCTCQ\n\nlt\ni\n\n\xd0\x97\xd0\x93/\n\n-J\' -1\nQi-i \xd0\x9e\n\xd0\x93) Z\n\xd0\x9e" \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\'\nUJ \xd0\x9e\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\xbe s:\n\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\n1\xd0\x9b\n\xc2\xab\xd0\x9b\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\n2!\n\nLO\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\xa71\n\n^\n\n\xd0\x9e\nCO\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\xa2z.\n\nOS\n1\xe2\x80\x941 Q.\n\nt/1 >\xe2\x80\x941\n\nC\\J\n\n00\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb3>\n00\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb3>\n\nLU\n\nQ\n\nCO\n\nn\n\xc2\xaba-\n\n^.\na\\\nCM\n\ngj\nH-\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\n. .. t\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd0\x97\xd0\x95\xd0\xa2 DO \xd0\x93\xd0\xad\n\xd0\x9e 1\xd0\x9b\n\n3\n\xd0\xa17)\n\n\xd1\x88\n\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb5\n\n\xd1\x87-\n\n\xd1\x88\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n>\nre\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\nre\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n-\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\nre\n\n\xd1\x87re\n\ng\n\n(X\n\nre\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94i \xd0\xa1\xd0\xa3\n\ns: uj\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nPage intentionally left blank\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nION TEMPERKTURE\n\nSCO*\xc2\xbb P\\_KmoCM SENSOR.\n\nCOSMIC DOST DETECTOC.J ELECTRONICS\n\nPARTICLE DETECTOR i BOOM\n\nTRANSCEIVER\nAKJTE.WWA\nOUTER STRUCTURAL SHfLL\nTELESCOPE STRUCTURE\n\nVLP\n\n"id\'\n\nMICROWAVE\n\n^AOIOWETER.\n\nANTENfJA\n\nPOLDINO ANTENNA\n\nTT AMD C. 6.NTTE.NN\xc2\xbb (S DIP^\n\n\\\n\nUX.GATE MAGNETOMETER. \' \xd0\x92\xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\xd0\x93\xd0\x9b\nRESOUUTIOrJ IR CAMERA\nI.S Mtrtr TCLESCOPe \xd0\x90\xd0\x97\xd0\x97\xd0\x93\n\xe2\x80\x94 PbSSvME.

Emphasis was\non the special requirements imposed by platform operations, particularly onorbit servicing. Physical, functional, and operational interfaces were\nidentified for all mission modes. Mission profiles and timelines were constructed to define significant events and to establish mission duration\nrequirements for each mode. Platform interface requirements were established\nand compared to the available support from the defined transportation systems.\nRequirements for additional interface provisions were identified. Alternate\nmethods of satisfying these additional interface needs were evaluated, and\nthe changes imposed on the transportation systems were identified.\nIn addition, the applicability of solar electric propulsion (SEP) to\nplatform programs was briefly investigated. Payload performance, operational\ncompatibility, and potential program cost impacts were evaluated.\nTRANSPORTATION INTERFACES\nInterface Requirements\n\nThe interface requirements between platforms and transportation systems\nare primarily a function of operational modes rather than specific platform\nconfigurations. This is because of configuration similarities among all of\nthe platform types considered in the study. All are supported by a common\nsubsystems/utilities module which contains most of the interface provisions\nfor the transportation system. Thus, while wide variations in mission equipment appear within the platform inventories, the platforms offer a relatively\ncommon physical interface to the transportation elements. Hence, the major\ninterface variables are dependent upon differences in functions and operations.\nThe following spectrum of operational modes were selected for analysis.\nPlatform placement\nAuto/remote servicing\nPlacement plus auto/remote servicing\nManned servicing\nPlacement plus manned servicing\nAscent profiles and mission timelines were developed for these five\nmission modes. Basic trajectory events and tug operations were taken from the\nTOPS study recently completed by Space Division. Platform-related operations,\ndeployment, servicing, etc., were derived from pertinent configuration, subsystems, and servicing definition data contained in Volumes IV and V. The\ndetails for each mission mode were developed to a level of depth sufficient to\nidentify the orbital transportation system (OTS) platform interfaces. For\n\n7-1\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nexample, Figure 7-1 relates the time history of the major functions required\nfor the OTS/platform interface for an unmanned placement and servicing mission\nprofile. The mission intervals during which each interface function is active\nare identified and interface combinations are correlated to the various mission\nphases and operations. These functions were analyzed to a lower level of detail\nto determine their method of implementation. The mission durations developed\nfor the five modes were used to assess the impact of consumables requirements\nresulting from the OTS/platform interface. Required mission durations are\nsummarized in Table 7-1.\nFrom the above mission and configuration data, all physical, operational,\nand functional interfaces between the platform and OTS were identified for\neach of the five operational modes. These are shown in Table 7-2.\nInterface provisions for placement missions require only "one-way"\nseparation and electrical disconnects. Servicing missions add requirements\nfor "two-way" attachment (separation and docking) and remating of electrical\nconnectors. Similar additions are required for electrical power, ground\ncommunications, and hardwire data links. A further requirement is imposed by\nservicing missions in that docking is accomplished via the servicing unit\nrather than the tug; and manned servicing also entails atmosphere control.\nThese principal interface requirements are summarized in Table 7-2.\nThe platform interface requirements were compared to the tug payload\ninterface and support capabilities to determine additional interface needs.\nRepresentative capabilities for transportation system elements were obtained\nfrom current sources.\nThe unmanned tug configuration was the high-technology tug defined for\nthe Tug Operations and Payload Support Study (TOPSS), recently completed by\nRockwell International. It was designed principally for the delivery and\nretrieval of payloads with emphasis on autonomous operations. It was sized\ntoward the maximum payload performance capability which could be packaged\ninto the shuttle cargo bay while leaving sufficient space for typical payload\nvolumes and shapes. Payload interfaces were simplified in confonrance\nwith the emphasis on autonomous operations.\nGuidance and control subsystems were mechanized for the autonomous delivery\nand deployment of payloads with placement accuracies of 30 to 50 nautical miles\nin geosynchronous orbits. Attitude stabilization and payload separation\ntip-off dynamics were designed for expected systems needs. Onboard capability\nfor rendezvous and docking was provided for payload retrieval and return to\nthe shuttle. Electrical power was provided to the payload for thermal control\nand safety monitoring functions. Tug overall mission life was sized for a\nnominal six-day mission profile plus one day for contingencies. These\ncapabilities are summarized in Table 7-3,along with the added interface\nneeds imposed by platform configuration and operations.\n\n7 2\n\n"\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nGO\n\na\nQ.\n\nfO fc\n\n> \xd0\xbe\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2- \xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb8\n4-*\n\n4->\n\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\x9e\n0\xd0\xbe8\n\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e\n\n4->\n\xd0\xa1\n\n<\xd0\xab\n\n\xd0\x95\n>>\n0\n\n\'\xd0\xbe.\n\non\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5.\n\xd0\xbe\n\nGO\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94\n> \xd1\x874J\n+J\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb8 \xd1\x82\xd0\xb7\nS\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\n1\n\'\xd0\xbe.\n\xd0\xbe>\nGO\n\xd0\xbe \xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\n\n\xd0\x95 \xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb-) \xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\n7-3\n\n0\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n\xd1\x81\n\xd1\x81\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb8\n\xd0\xb8\n0)\n\n\xd0\xbe;\n\xd0\xbe\n\nS\xd0\x9e)\n\n01\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe.\n\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nro\n\nOJ\n\nSV\n\n\xd0\xb8\n\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e\nU\n\n\xd1\x81:\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xa1 \xd0\xac-\n\n4-\xc2\xbb I\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e \xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd1\x87- \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\n-\xd0\xb8\n\xd0\xbe \xd1\x81\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2- \xd0\xbe\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xb3- (\xd0\x9b\n4J (\xd0\x9b\n\n\xd1\x81 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xbe) s:\n-\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\n\n\xd0\xb3-\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n\xd1\x81\n\n\xd1\x84\n\n01 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xd0\xbe. \xd0\xbe\n\nI\xe2\x80\x94 <U\n\n+\xe2\x80\xa2>\n\n\xd1\x87- \xd1\x81\n\n\xd0\x9e -!->\n\n\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd TD\n\n0) \xd0\xa8\n\xe2\x80\xa2(J \xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\n\nt- S-\n\n\xd0\xbe \xd0\xbe\n(\xd0\x9e -I\xd1\x87- >\n\n\xd0\x9e\xc2\xbb -I-\n\n\xd1\x81\n\n1-\xd0\xbd \xd0\x9e>\n\n4-> U\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^ \xd0\x93\xd0\x9e \xd1\x81\n\'i \xd0\x9e\n4->\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n4->\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\nIV\n\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xb8\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nto < \xd1\x81\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nTable 7-1.\n\nMission Duration Summary\n\nDuration, hours\n\nOperational Mode\nUnmanned\nPlatform placement\nAuto/remote servicing\nPlacement + auto/remote\nservicing\n\n73\n148\n140\n\nManned\nManned servicing\nPlacement + manned servicing\n\n144\n143\n\nThe high-technology tug selected the probe and drogue docking mechanism\nto meet the requirement for interfacing with spinning payloads. Alternate\nprovisions are required with platforms to permit internal access for servicing\noperations.\nThe electrical interface provided power to the payload principally for\nthermal control during transit. Power for servicing operations must also be\nprovided in the case of platform programs.\nThe capability of the tug to deploy a payload in geosynchronous orbit\nwithin 25 nautical miles altitude, 0.1-degree inclination, imparting no more\nthan 0.1-g acceleration or 1 degree-per-second tip-off rate is adequate\nfor platform operations.\nStability and pointing accuracies provided by the tug are adequate for\nestablishing and maintaining uninterrupted communication between the platform\nand earth.

Adequate power levels\nof up to 700 watts support the platform needs, but the energy capability is\ninsufficient to support a full placement/servicing mission.\nThe contamination interface between the platforms and the tug is missionsensitive and is resolved on an individual basis.\nThe manned tug configuration was based on extrapolation from the unmanned\nhigh-technology tug capabilities. In the derivation of its characteristics\nit was assumed that manned tugs would be designed principally for on-orbit\nservicing missions. Man\'s presence was deemed unnecessary for simple deployment and retrieval operations. Thus, the manned tug was postulated to include\nprovisions for manned servicing operations including basic crew support. It\nwas also assumed to provide at least the same levels of payload support as\ndefined for the unmanned tug. Table 7-4 summarizes the comparison analysis\nbetween the manned tug capabilities and the platform interface needs.\nThe manned tug docking mechanization must.be compatible with the shuttle\ndocking interface to permit crew ingress and egress. The electrical\nconnector interface is a general-purpose interface adaptable to a multitude\nof satellites including the platform. The manned tug is designed for the\npurpose of servicing satellites and, therefore, possesses a general-purpose\ndata management, monitor,and control subsystem. It can be linked to payloads\nthrough a specials-purpose data interfacing adapter. Its communication with\nthe ground in support of servicing will be identical to the method established\nfor the unmanned tug.\n\nInterface Implementation\nInterface trades and related analyses were conducted to determine the\npreferred concepts for each of the interface requirements defined above.\nTable 7-5 summarizes the interface additions required by platforms, identifies\nthe options available for satisfying these requirements, and presents the\nselected concepts. The following discussion highlights the principal evaluations and results.\nThe communication link between the servicing unit and ground control may\nbe implemented by the following three options:\n1. Direct to the service unit\n2. Via the tug communication subsystem\n3. Via the tug communication and data management subsystem\nFigure 7-2 depicts Option 1, the direct communication link between the\nservice unit and ground. This option provides a completely independent\n\xe2\x80\xa2communication link paralleling the tug ground communication link. Both links\nmust be used concurrently during servicing operations, since the tug provides\nthe propulsion, attitude and stabilization control, and power management during\ndocking, servicing, and separation activities. This option provides the\nsimplest hardwire interface between the remote servicing unit and the tug,\n7-7\nSD

impacts the total system by requiring two separate communication links,\nwhich double the subsystems power and weight, ground communication loads, and\nequipment costs.\nOption 2 as depicted in Figure 7-3 modifies and utilizes the tug communication link to provide the necessary service unit RF ground control link. This\noption utilizes the existing tug communication television transmission capability for both the docking and the servicing operations by coax switching and\nrouting of the television signals to the transmitter. An independent service\nunit telemetry data link is provided by adding a subcarrier modulator PCM data\nlink to the tug RF multiplexer. Data rates up to 25 kbps are easily accommodated by the present-day state-of-the-art S-band communication subsystems.\nThe tug two-kbps command uplink is used for both the tug and remote servicing\nunit control by interleaving coded digital commands on the single RF carrier.\nThe added communication equipment is located in the tug to simplify the interfacing and operations of the RF equipment.\nOption 3 interfaces the ground control of the service unit through the\ntug communication and data management system as depicted in Figure 7-4. This\noption minimizes the addition of equipment, but maximizes the modification of\ntug subsystems. This is particularly evident in the software and data management subsystem, as well as in the added ground operation complexities in the\nsoftware integration and simulation impacts.\nOption 1 minimizes the impact to the baseline tug, but Option 2 is preferred because it results in the least impact to the total program.\nPower was sufficient from both the manned and unmanned tug subsystems,\nbut the energy available from the unmanned tug was insufficient to conduct the\npotential maximum number of platform servicing missions. Adding approximately\n10 pounds of fuel cell reactants to the tug satisfied the requirement with\nless weight impact than extra batteries.\nThe electrical umbilical and the docking aid on the platform were located\nto be compatible with both of the defined OTS vehicles (unmanned and manned).\nEvolution from unmanned servicing to manned concepts will require a\ndocking adapter which allows the smaller docking mechanism of the manned system to dock with the larger unmanned docking port. The large diameter on the\ncommon support modules is required for articulation of manipulator arms during\nauto-remote servicing operations. The docking adapter consists of two concentric docking mechanisms. The inner system is approximately five feet in\ndiameter and is compatible with the space shuttle docking system. The outer\nmechanism is approximately seven feet in diameter and mates with the common\nsupport modules of the geosynchronous platforms.\nShuttle-to-platform hardwire interfaces are required to monitor and\ncontrol platform subsystems while the platform and the tug are in the shuttle\ncargo bay. The options for this interface include: (1) hardline direct to\nthe shuttle; (2) hardline through the tug to the shuttle; and (3) utilization\nof the established payload/tug monitor and control interface with the signals\n\n7-11\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nGO\n\n2:\n\xd0\xbe\n\n7-12\n\nSpace Division\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n<\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xb0)\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n3\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n3\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nto\n\xd0\xb8\n\nl/l\n-Q\n\n\xd0\xa9\n4-\xc2\xbb\n(\xd0\x9b\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n<c\n2:\nz:\nLJ\n\ni\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nV\nfl\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\nQ.\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n.\nCO\n\noo Q\n\n00 *\n\n:\xd1\x8d \xe2\x80\x94I\n\nOQ \xd0\x9e\n\na:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2=c \xd0\xbe\n\nQ \xd0\x9e\n\nQi\n\n7-13\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\nCO\n\n\xd0\xbe;\nLU\n\xd0\x9e\n\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\nor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-" \xd0\xbe\nS <c\n\n\xd0\xa8 Q\n\n\xd0\xa8 t- 1 <J\nCO\n\nQ\n\n<c\n\nOO\n\n1\n\xd0\xad\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9b\n\nCO\nUJ\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n3\nO>\n\n2\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb7\n\n1\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x82\xd0\xb7\n\xd1\x81\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nOO\n\n(\xd0\x9b\n-Q\n\n+->\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa8\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nOO\n\nz\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\nQ\n\nto\n\nCO\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n*\n\nH-\n\nr>\n\n45\n\nQ\n\n5 5\n5\nCJJ\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\ncarried to the shuttle via the tug data management subsystems. Option 3\nwas selected since these provisions are required to support mission requirements after separation from the shuttle. However, this approach can be\napplied only to the unmanned system. On-orbit assembly requirements for\nthe defined two-stage, manned tug eliminate the tug-involved options. During\nassemblyjthe payload must remain in the shuttle cargo bay while the two\npropulsion stages are joined. Thus, for manned operations, only Option 1,\ndirect hardline to the shuttle can satisfy the monitor and control interface\nneeds.\nSOLAR ELECTRIC PROPULSION (SEP) APPLICABILITY\n\nAs a further factor in the analysis and understanding of transportation\nsystem interfaces and requirements, the applicability of a solar electric\npropulsion stage (SEPS) to platform programs was briefly investigated.\nAlthough previously considered primarily for interplanetary flights, SEPS is\napplicable to the geo-orbital regime. The use of a geosynchronous SEPS\n(called Geoseps) in conjunction with the shuttle and tug was investigated in\nReference 7-1. As part of the geosynchronous platform study, an evaluation\nof the applicability of Geoseps to geosynchronous platforms was evaluated.\nGeoseps stage configuration and performance characteristics from Reference\n7-1 were utilized.\nGeoseps Configuration and Operational Concept\nThe Geoseps has the unique combination of a very high ISn and a highdensity, non-cryogenic Mercury propellent. The nominal Isp of 3000 seconds\nand the propellent density of 13.5 times that of water result in a design in\nwhich the propel1 ant and tankage are not dominant elements, as they are in\nchemical propulsion stages. The basic Geoseps design is depicted in Figure\n7-5. The key elements are the large deployable solar arrays, power conditioner\npanel, ion thruster array, central compartment, and docking mechanism. The\nsolar arrays are 260 feet, tip to tip, and generate an initial total power\nof 25 kilowatts at 200 to 400 volts. Of this a maximum of 21 kilowatts is\nprocessed by power conditioners to operate seven 30-cm thrusters generating\ntotal thrust of 0.206 pounds. Two additional thrusters are included in the\narray to extend total thrust life through shared usage.\nThe most effective use of Geoseps for geosynchronous missions is in conjunction with a high thrust chemical stage such as the reusable tug. Direct\nascent from the shuttle orbit using Geoseps alone would require extremely long\nmission times (several hundred days). Also, lengthy passage through the highintensity Van Allen radiation belts would result in severe solar cell degradation,\nIn the preferred approach (see Figure 7-6), the tug is used to deliver\nthe Geoseps and payload to an intermediate orbit, called the changeover orbit,\nfrom which the Geoseps propels the payload into the desired geosynchronous\norbit. After placing the Geoseps into the changeover orbit, the tug returns\nimmediately to the shuttle. Once boosted into the changeover orbit by the\ntug, the Geoseps performs a series of round trips between changeover and geosynchronous orbits exchanging returned payloads for new payloads to be delivered.\nAfter depletion of its propellant (536 days of thrusting operations) the Geoseps\n\n7-14\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nEIGHT 3-KW\nPOWER CONDITIONERS\n(FOUR ON EACH SIDE)\n\nDOCKING\nMECHANISM\n\nCENTRAL\nCOMPARTMENT\nNINE 30-CM\nTHRUSTER\nARRAY\n\nSTAR SENSORS (4)\n\n12.5 KW\nSOLAR ARRAY\n\nFigure 7-5. Geoseps Configuration\nmay be abandoned in space or returned to the ground for refurbishment. The\ninter-orbital operations with this mission concept are depicted in Figure 7-6.\nAlthough the reference mission shown consists of five round trips ranging from\n81 to 154 days, flexibility exists to trade numbers of trips, trip time, and\npayload weight. Payloads in excess of 10,000 pounds can be delivered or\nreturned. Round-trip payloads exceeding 6000 pounds can also be achieved.\nApplicability Assessment\nThe applicability of Geoseps to platform programs was assessed in terms\nof payload capability, mission flexibility, compatibility with on-orbit servicing operations, and potential program cost impacts. The Geoseps payload\ncapability greatly exceeds the requirements for platform delivery and servicing\nmissions defined during the study. Maximum platform weights were less than\n8500 pounds, compared to the more than 10,000-pound Geoseps capability defined\nabove. Geoseps further offers the flexibility and performance capability for\nconducting widely- spaced servicing missions, but introduces operational and\ndesign complexities for implementation; for example, the payload exchange\noperations in the changeover orbit. Also, the long trip times are incompatible\nwith manned servicing modes.\n\n7-15\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nGEOSEPS ROUND TRIPS\nSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT\n\nOLD\nSTAGE\nLEFT IN\nORBIT\n\nMULTIPLE UP PAYLOADS:\n(4850 LB TOTAL/LEG)\nMULTIPLE DOWN PAYLOADS:\n(4850 LB TOTAL/LEG)\nCHANGEOVER ORBITS:\n(a) 10,853 x 10,853 NMX \xd0\x9f.\xd0\x93\n(b) 15,929 x 15,929 NM X 6.2\xc2\xb0\nHIGH TECHNOLOGY TUG\n(FULL SIZE 35 FT)\nSHUTTLE ORBITINTERORBITAL FLIGHTS\n\nFigure 7-6.\n\nReference Mission Schematic\n\nThe above combination of high performance and operational flexibility\npotentially offers reduced transportation costs through reduced numbers of\nshuttle/tug flights. To evaluate this potential, a representative platform\nprogram was selected from the program options derived in this study (see\nTable 8-1).\nThe selected reference program has several key features. It covers the\nbaseline traffic model for the years 1981 through 1990. It-is the multifunction platform program option, with remote servicing and a 50-percent\nmodule replacement every two years. The program comprises 18 platform\ndeliveries and 72 update/servicing operations. When this program is used,\n56 shuttle/tug flights and 2 remote servicing units are required to meet the\nresulting traffic and servicing needs. Total programs costs are $2784 M.\nAn equivalent program was constructed for the shuttle/tug/Geoseps\ncombination. Platform deliveries and servicing schedules were held fixed as\nwere the shuttle/tug performance and volumetric constraints. However, the\nextra payload capability and on-orbit life of the Geoseps were considered in\nthe construction of a new transportation usage model. The resulting traffic\ncharacteristics are summarized in Table 7-6. Briefly, 16 missions involving\nmostly platform deliveries were performed by the shuttle and tug alone. An\nadditional 19 missions were flown with the shuttle/tug/Geoseps. These were\nmostly servicing missions, but included the delivery of three TORS platforms.\nA total of 35 shuttle flights was required, along, with a cumulative Geoseps\noperating time of 4250 hours. With a thrust life of 536 hours, eight Geoseps\nwere required. Also, two extra remote servicing units were required (a total\nof four) because of fleet impact effects associated with the long trip times.\n\n7-16\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe_\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\n\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n-\xd0\xb0\n\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xbf\xd0\x97\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\n\n\xd1\x88\n\xd0\xbe\nS-\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x87\xd1\x8e\nD-\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n.\xd0\xb0\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\x9f\xd0\x97\n4-*\n\xd0\x9e\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd1\x81\xd1\x82.\n\nCTl\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\x93-\xd1\x87\n\n00\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\nin\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n00\n\n_\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n(\xd0\x9b\n\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\nin i\xe2\x80\x94\n1\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\nI\nD\n\n"~\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n00\n\n\xd0\xae\n4->\n\n\xd0\xa1\n\xd0\x9f\n\n.\xd1\x81\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\nLI-\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\n3\n\xd0\xac\\\n\n(\xd0\x9b i\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xb3- \xd1\x81:\nST \xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f >,\n3 i_ CU\n1\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\x9e) \xd0\x9e\n\n4->\n4->\n3\n-\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\x9e) -\xd0\xb3- >\n\n\xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94 5\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f \xd0\x9e) \xd0\x9e)\n\xd0\xa1 Q \xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\n\xd1\x87-\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xb3-\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 CM f\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94 \xd1\x81\xd0\xbc \xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c \xd0\xa8 \xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e \xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n* *\ni\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n\xd0\xa8\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\nVD\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n~\n\n(^^\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n\xd0\xb3^\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x8e\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\x9f\xd0\x97\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb7\xd1\x87\n*~~\n\n^-\n\n*>\n*~\n\n*\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\xd0\xb3\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xd0\xb8_\n\ni\xd0\xa8\n\nJ-\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\xd0\x9e\n\n-\xd0\xbe\n1\xd0\x9b \xd0\x9e\xd1\x88 ^\xd1\x8d\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n(\xd0\xa2\xd0\x97\n"D\n\n\xd1\x82\xd0\xb7\n\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xb8\xd0\x9f\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n~\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x86_\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x88\n\n\xd1\x81\n\xd1\x88\n\xd0\xbe\n-\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n\'5\n\n\xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e)\n\n\xc2\xab\xd0\xbb\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\n\n0\nCD\n\n>>\n\n\xd1\x88\n\n"\xd0\x9e\n\n01\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n!\n\nto\n\n-\xd0\xbe\n\n0\n4->\n^\n\xd0\x9b\xd0\x97\n\n*\n\n\xd1\x88\ni1\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n\nQ\n\n\xd1\x81\xd1\x85\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xb0:\nr\xe2\x80\x94\n\n>\n-^\n3\n\n+->\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd1\x88\nQ\n\n4J\n\n\xd0\xbe)\n\xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\n\n4->\n\n-\xd1\x81\n\n4J\n\n\xd0\xbe\n1\xe2\x80\x94 \xd0\x9d-\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xac-\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\n\xd0\x93--\xc2\xbb\n\noo \xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\nLO\n\nin\n\nr-\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n*f\n\n\xc2\xab\xd1\x8d-\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\n<3-\n\n\xd0\xb3-\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 LO\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n\xd0\xa8\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n00\n\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xb3-\n\n|~~\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\n4\n\n\xd0\x93 *.\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\nto\n\n\xd1\x88\n\n\xd0\x95\n\n+J\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\n0\n\n\xd0\x9e \xd0\x9e\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8 \xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\n\n-\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\xa8\n\n\xd0\x93\xd0\x9e\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xae\n\n-\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9f\n\nt-~\n\n-\xd0\xb3-\n\n1\xd0\x9b\n4-J\n\n.\xd1\x81\n\xd0\xa1\n\nen\n4->\n\xd0\x9f\xd0\x97\n1-\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\nU.\n\n-\xd0\xb3-\n\n(\xd0\x9b > >\n\xd0\x9e- i- i-\n\n1\xe2\x80\x94\n\n4- \xd0\xae 1/1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2i- \xd1\x81\xd0\xb8 01\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\x9c \xd0\xa1\xd0\x9e\n\xd0\xa1 + +\n\n\xd0\xa2\xd0\x97\n\n\xd0\xbe\xc2\xbb \xd1\x81\xd0\xbf\nCL\n3\n\xd0\xbe\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\\\n\n\xd0\xb7\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe ^i- in\n0 >, >,\n\xd1\x81\xc2\xa3&-&-\xd1\x88\xd0\xb0)\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\n\n0) \xd0\x9e) \xd0\x9e \xd0\x9e \xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\x9e- i\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd0\x9e) 4->\n\xd0\xac\xd0\x9e\n4->\n\n>>\xe2\x80\xa2!\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2!- -1-\n\nQ.-I\xe2\x80\xa2!->>>\nOil \xe2\x80\x94 i\xe2\x80\x94 i- i- i( \xd0\x9b \xd0\xa8 \xd1\x84 \xd0\xa8 \xd0\xa8 \xd0\xa4\n\n\xd1\x88\n\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb7\n\n\xd0\xae\n\n\xd1\x88\n\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb7\n\n7-17\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nShuttle and tug alone, rather than with the Geoseps, were used for the\ninitial platform deliveries because they fit existing cost models and do not\ninvolve the unknown factors associated with long-delivery programs. For this\nreason,, direct tug deliveries were used in the comparative Geoseps program\nabove. Cost impacts with the Geoseps program are summarized in Table 7-7.\nThe use of Geoseps results in $121.5M savings in recurring transportation/\nservicing costs, which is 17 percent of the equivalent costs without Geoseps.\nNet savings are dependent upon the method employed for sharing Geoseps\ndevelopment costs with other programs and range between $57M and $87M for the\nbaseline traffic model. Extrapolation to the new traffic model predicted that\nnet savings up to $265M are possible.\nConclusions\nThe key findings from the above analysis are summarized as follows.\n.\n\nThe Geoseps offers wide flexibility in the delivery and return\nof payloads to and from geosynchronous orbits. Various modes\nmay be employed, and trip time can be traded against payload\nweight.\n\n.\n\nGeoseps offers long on-orbit life and performance flexibility\nfor conducting widely-spaced servicing operations and can\nprovided up to 20 kilowatts of electrical power for servicing\noperations.\n\n.\n\nImprovements in transportation system performance due to the\nabove factors result in significant program net cost savings,\n$57M to $87M (baseline traffic model) or up $265M (new traffic\nmodel).\n\nThese advantages must be weighed against the following considerations.\n.\n\nThe platform programs defined in this study do not require the\nextra payload capability offered by the Geoseps if a high\ntechnology tug is available. However, lower tug performance\nwould require reconfigured platforms to reduce their weight or\nsupplemental payload capability such as that offered by Geoseps.\n\n.\n\nThe use of Geoseps adds the operational complexity of payload\nexchange operations between the tug and Geoseps. Long trip\ntimes with Geoseps compound the mission control and fleet\noperation problems associated with on-orbit servicing.\n\nIt is concluded that the use of Geoseps for geosynchronous platform programs is feasible and offers significant potential cost savings as well as\nunique operational flexibilities. These factors must be weighed against\nadded mission complexity, and must be analyzed in greater detail, and the\napplication of Geoseps broadened to fully understand the implications of its\nuse with other elements in the total National Space Program.\n\n7 18\n\n"\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nCO\nO-\n\noi\n(\xd0\x9b\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\x9e)\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\x9e)\n1\xd0\x9b\n\nin\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\xa2.\n\xd1\x81\n\nto\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\nI/I\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe.\ns\xd0\xbe\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe_\n\n\xd0\xb3-i\n\xd0\x9e)\n\n\xd0\xa52\n(\xd0\x9e\n\nto\n\n\xd0\x9e \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 -\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2!->\n\n\xd0\xbe 2:\n<o \xc2\xab\xd0\xbbcu\n\nQ\n\n-!->\n3 CO\n\n0 0-\n\n.c ij\ni\n+-> CO\n\n3\n\n.\xd1\x81 \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n4-> 0\xe2\x80\xa2r- UJ\n\n3 \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\nto\nJ_\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nM\n0\n\n<o\nu_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nH\nto\n0\n\nt_>\n\nVD\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n+\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n+\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbc\n\xd1\x8e\ni\n\n^a-\n\nCM\n\n\xd1\x81\xd1\x85\xd1\x8d\n\nt\n\nCM\n\nUD\n\nin\n\nun\nco\n\n3\n\nQ\n-\n\nto\n+J\n\xe2\x80\xa2i\n\n^z\nO)\nr\xe2\x80\x94\n\n*ftO JZ\n\ncu ^->\n\n"O\n\n^:\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n^~^\n\n3 \xd0\x9e\n\xd0\xae\n\n"\xd0\x9e \xd0\x93^\n\ncr\xc2\xbb^^\n+J \xd0\x9e\n\xe2\x80\x94 (\xd0\x9e\n\n(\xd0\x9b\n\ni- \xe2\x80\xa2\n-i- \xd0\xbe\n\n3 -C\n\n-4-J\n\ncu \xe2\x80\xa2\nto in\n\ncu\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xb3*^\nJ_ \xe2\x80\x94\n\n3 ID\n\n\xd0\x9e\xd0\x9e\n\ncu\n^a\n\xd0\xb7\n-Zi\n\n\xd1\x81\nfc\n\nDC.\n\n\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\n\n\xe2\x80\x94i\n\xe2\x80\x94J\n\n\xd1\x8e\n\nCU 1\xd0\x9b\n\ns:\n\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\nCU\n\n_c \xe2\x80\xa2\nto \xd0\xb5\xd0\xbc\n\n\xd0\xbe ^\n\xd1\x87-\xe2\x80\x94\n\nto cu\na.\ncu s:\n\n\xd0\xbe\xe2\x80\x94\n\xd1\x87- ^\n\nb-\n\ncu cu\nr\xe2\x80\xa2i-> 2:\n\ni-\n\ncu\n_a\n\xd1\x81\n\xd1\x81\n\xd1\x8d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2Z.\n\n7-19\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\n\xd0\xaa\xd0\x9e-\n\nIT)\nCO\n\xc2\xab\xd0\x9b-\n\n\xd0\x93^\nLO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2si s:\n\nCM\ni\xe2\x80\x94\n1\n\ns: m r^\n\xd1\x8e \xd1\x8e \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\nt\xe2\x80\x94 i\ni\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2f>\n\n4->\n\nCU\n\n-(->\nQ.\n0\n\n\xd1\x81\n\nto\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xa1\xd0\xa2.\n\xd0\xa1\n\n>\n\n\xd0\xa1\n\n\xd0\x9e\n\nto\n\nJ-\n\n-\xd0\xbe\n\n3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2!\n\nCU CD\n\n\xc2\xa3 \'cu\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xa8\n\n>\n\xd0\xae\nto\ntO\n\xd0\x9eCU\n1\xd0\x9b\n0\n\nS-\n\nCJ -Z.\n\ncu cu\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2->\n\n\xd0\xae\n4->\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\xd1\x88\n\nQ\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n8.0 PROGRAM EVALUATION\n\nThe characteristics of alternate geosynchronous programs were examined on\nthe basis of the geosynchronous platform configurations, servicing concepts,\nand equipment definition discussed in Section 6.0. The purpose of this examination was to develop a recommended geosynchronous program approach utilizing\nthese systems. Specifically, the shuttle/tug traffic characteristics necessary\nto carry out these programs were determined. Variations in servicing levels\nand frequency were also considered. The costs of the resultant programs were\nthen defined and the alternate program approaches compared. Programs using\nconventional expendable satellites were also defined and examined only to the\nextent necessary to permit the comparison of these programs with on-orbit\nserviced platform programs. Equal time-phased, on-orbit operational capabilities\nwere maintained within the program options for each traffic model. Platform\nschedules were structured to provide a total capability at least equivalent\nto the satellite programs they replace. However, the higher unit capacities\nof platforms produced slight surpluses of capability during their early years\nof service.\nPROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY\n\nThe overall program evaluation methodology, including the identification\nof the necessary input data, is illustrated in Figure 8-1. A detailed discussion of the methodology and the data developed during the evaluation are contained in Volume VI, Geosynchronous Program Evaluations and Recommendations.\nThe basic input data necessary to conduct the evaluation analyses were the\ntraffic models and the satellite population histories discussed in Volume IV,\nthe platform configurations and servicing concepts discussed in Volume V, and\nthe space transportation system characteristics and capabilities discussed in\nVolume III.\nThe traffic models, plus the satellite population histories, provided the\ndefinition of the time-phased on-orbit operational capability which must be\nprovided by the platform programs. These data, with the definition of the\nplatform configuration concepts, provided the basis for the development of\nplatform delivery schedules. The resultant schedules are analogous to the\nspacecraft delivery schedules defined by the traffic models and, as such, only\nidentify when platforms must be delivered to retain at least the equivalent\non-orbit operational capability. Multi-mission opportunities were considered\nto determine the required shuttle/tug traffic characteristics.\nThe basic program options treated in the study are outlined in Figure\n8-2. The principal programs considered were the on-orbit serviced geosynchronous platform programs including both single function and multifunction platforms. For each platform class, both remote and manned servicing\nwere considered. In order to parametrically assess the impact of the\nservicing operations on the total program costs, a limited set of alternate\n\n8-1\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nl\ni\n\n\xd1\x86\xc2\xbb ui\n\n85\n\n8-2\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\n\xd0\xb0\n55\n5\n\n<_) \xd0\xbe \xd0\x9e-\n\nOf. >\n\n\xd0\x9e1\n\n00\n\nCTi\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe.\n\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n<\xd0\x9e\n>\n\n4J\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xa2\xd0\xad\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nSpace Division\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nREMOTE\nSERVICING\n\nSPARES:\n25% PER YEAR\n\nMANNED\nSERVICING\n\nSPARES:\n25% PER YEAR\n\nSINGLEFUNCTION\nPLATFORMS\n\nSPARES:\n25% PER YEAR\nSPARES:\n50% PER YEAR\n\nREMOTE\nSERVICING\n\nSPARES:\n50% PER 2 YEARS\n\nMULTIFUNCTION\nPLATFORMS\n\nSPARES:\n25% PER YEAR\nMANNED\nSERVICING\n\nSPARES:\n50% PER YEAR\nSPARES;\n50% PER 2 YEARS\n\n\xd0\xb3\n1\n\nI\n\n~\nEXPENDABLE\nSATELLITES\n\nI\n\n(DELIVERY ONLY)\n\nL\n\nFigure 8-2.\n\nProgram Alternatives\n\n8-3\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nservicing levels and frequencies were examined. The values examined were\nselected for the purpose of establishing the impact and program sensitivity\nto the servicing level and frequency, and do not necessarily represent the\nvalues which will ultimately be required in an operational program. Relatively\nhigh servicing levels and frequencies were selected to ensure that the impact\nof these considerations would be evident.\nThe basic set of program alternatives resulted in the definition of eight\nprogram options. When both the baseline and new traffic models were considered,\na total of 16 programs was examined. An indication of the sensitivity to\nthe level of traffic was obtained by consideration of both traffic models. In\naddition to the platform programs, conventional expendable satellite programs\nwere briefly examined for the purpose of providing a point of comparison with\nthe platform programs. Since the fundamental purpose of this study was the\ndefinition of geosynchronous platform programs, the conventional expendable\nsatellite programs are provided for reference only.\nThe shuttle/tug launch schedules required to initiate and support the\nprogram alternatives identified in Figure 8-2 were developed in light of the\nplatform physical characteristics and the physical and performance characteristics of the space transportation systems. During the development of these\nlaunch schedules, multiple-purpose shuttle/tug flights were included when the\npayload requirements did not exceed the dimensional and performance constraints\nof the space transportation systems. For example, payload deliveries were\ncombined with on-orbit servicing missions whenever sufficient volume was\navailable in the shuttle cargo bay and when adequate tug performance capability\nwas available.\nTotal program costs were developed on the basis of these schedules and\nthe definition of the platform concepts. The costs of programs using conventional expendable satellites were also developed for the purpose of providing a comparison base. These data provided the basis for evaluating the\nalternate program approaches and developing a recommended approach.\nPROGRAM COMPARISONS\n\nThe fundamental comparisons of the alternate program approaches are shown\nin Tables 8-1 and 8-2 for the baseline and new traffic models, respectively.\nThe comparisons shown in these tables consider the following: (1) the total\nnumber of shuttle/tug flights; (2) the maximum annual shuttle/tug launch\nrates; (3) the worst-case traffic distributions in the four geographic regions\ndefined in Section 5.0; (4) the total number of hardware end items; and (5)\nthe total program costs for the alternate platform programs. Also shown, for\ncomparison purposes, are the corresponding characteristics for the related\nconventional expendable satellite programs.\nAs can be seen from Tables 8-1 and 8-2, the platform programs involving\nremotely serviced multifunction platforms result in the lowest total program\ncosts due to lower numbers of hardware end items and fewer shuttle/tug flights.\nThe single function platform programs require more spacecraft on orbit than the\nmultifunction platform programs, which cause an increase in the recurring\nspacecraft costs. Also, the single function platform programs require more\n8-4\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\n<\xd0\xb2\n3\n\n\xd1\x81.\n\xd0\xbe\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe.\n\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n(\xd0\x9e\n\n\xd0\xbe>\n\xd0\xbe\nD-\n\n\xd1\x88\n-\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n\xd0\xbe\n(\xd0\x9e\nS-\n\n\xd0\x9e)\n(\xd0\x9b\n\n\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb5\n\n00\n\nI\n\n00\n\xd0\x9e)\n(\xd0\x9e\n\nt/>\n\no:\n\n\xc2\xabt\nCD\n\nQ\nLU\n\nj\nj\n\n_J LU\n\nQ !\nj\nZ \xe2\x80\x94I\nLU LU\n0 h\n.

The total costs of the manned servicing\nprograms are greater than the remotely serviced programs primarily due to the\nincreased number of shuttle/tug flights. The manned servicing missions require\ndual shuttle/tug launches for delivery and return of the manned servicing\nsystem. Also, total program costs are sensitive to the level and frequency of\nservicing. Although alternate servicing levels were not examined in detail for\nthe single function platform programs, the trends exhibited by the multifunction platform programs are considered to be representative of the trends\nwhich can be expected.\nAlthough costs must be a fundamental consideration in the development of\na recommended program approach, other factors must also be examined. These\ninclude the programmatic flexibility provided by the platform design approach,\nthe complexity and operational capabilities of the servicing systems, and the\noperational demands imposed on the space transportation systems. The impact\nof these considerations, which were also factors in the platform synthesis\nactivities, are discussed briefly below.\nA single platform design approach has been identified which permits a\nhigh degree of programmatic flexibility. The selected design approach, discussed in Section 6.0, will satisfy the utilities support requirements of both\nthe baseline and new traffic models with mission functions/payloads accommodated\neither singularly or in judiciously selected combinations. Many important\ndifferences do exist in the integration of the various mission equipment sets,\nbut they fall into the same general support requirements range. Therefore, a\nsingle utilities support module can be developed which will provide the necessary support for a variety of payloads. In addition, it has been determined\nthat standardized packaging of all subsystems is feasible. These fundamental\nstudy conclusions result in the elimination of platform size as a significant\nprogrammatic variable. The selected platform design approach also provides\nthe programmatic flexibility for an evolutionary on-orbit servicing approach\nfrom remote to manned, either suited or shirtsleeve, while minimizing the\ninitial platform design impact.\nThe ability to fully exploit the potential capabilities of the selected\nplatform design approach will depend upon a number of programmatic considerations during the operational era. An important consideration includes the\npotential complexities associated with the integration of mission equipment\nfrom multiple users into a single payload. This consideration extends into\nthe payload operation when several users are involved in the operation of\nmultiple-mission equipment sets on a single platform.\nAs a result of these programmatic considerations, the operational program\nmay shift toward the single function platform concept which retains "user\nidentity and control". User identity and control is of particular importance\nfor international and domestic (U.S. and foreign) communications functions. In\norder to fully utilize the "communications commonality" potential of multifunction platforms, both international and national, particularly in the U.S.\n(with private ownership), cooperation will be required. Such cooperation will\nalso be required to ensure that electromagnetic (EM) interference does not\n\n8-7\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\nbecome a problem. As discussed in Section 5.0, EM contention is likely to\noccur before 1990 if wider spectrum usage is not employed by communications\nrelay satellites.\nAlthough the multifunction, remotely serviced, platform program approach\nresults in the lowest total program costs, the ability to fully realize this\npotential cost savings will depend upon the ability to design, develop, and\noperate the remote servicing system. The principal design driver for remote\nservicing systems will be the ability to clearly define servicing functions\nthat must be performed and the level of operational flexibility that must be\naccommodated. The manipulator system developed will only be as "smart" as\nthe original design ingenuity.\nOf the platform programs considered, the manned servicing alternatives\nimpose the most severe demand on the space transportation systems. The high\ndemands are imposed primarily because of the requirement for dual shuttle/tug\nlaunches for servicing missions. Even when combined payload delivery and\nservicing missions are considered, the manned servicing programs still impose\nthe most severe demands. If the shuttle/tug system is considered as a national\nresource, the manned servicing alternative requires a major commitment of this\nresource, on a yearly basis, to support an active geosynchronous program.\nIf, during the operational era, the requirement for crew rescue is imposed,\nthis requirement would create an even greater demand on this resource. However, man brings unique capabilities to the realm of servicing operations,\nincluding flexibility for dealing with the unexpected. Until future experience\ndetermines the true nature of on-orbit servicing needs, the capabilities\ninherent with man-attendance modes must be held as a viable option.\n\n8-8\n\nSD 73-SA-0036-2\n\nSpace Division\nNorth American Rockwell\n\n9.0 REFERENCES\n\n4-1\n\nUpdated NASA Mission Model, from AAD/Deputy Associate Administrator\n(June 6, 1972).\n\n4-2\n\nStatement of Work for Geosynchronous Platform Definition Study,\nAppendix A, "Fleming" Mission Model (March 23, 1972).\n\n4-3\n\nIntegrated Operations/Payloads/Fleet Analysis, Aerospace Corporation\nReport No. ATR-72(7231)-1, (March 31., 1971).\n\n4-4\n\n"Mission Model", Tug Operations and Payload Support Study (TOPSS),\nRevision 1 (June 15, 1972).\n\n4-5\n\nKincade, R.
