A feature found at 2.1 eV loss energy is attributed to an excitation from occupied surface states into unoccupied surface states of energy within the bulk band gap. A surface band gap of approximately 1 eV is estimated. This result supports a previous suggestion for unoccupied band gap states based on core level energy loss spectroscopy. Using the valence band excitation energy loss spectrosocpy, it is also suggested that hydrogen is removed from the as-polished diamond surface by a Menzel-Gomer-Redhead mechanism.", "title": "Diamond /111/ studied by electron energy loss spectroscopy in the characteristic loss region", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830044457, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pepper, S.
