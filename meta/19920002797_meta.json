This facility serves as the focal point for real time flight control operations supporting the shuttle, spacelab, and selected payload systems. MCC upgrade accomplishments are as follows: replaced 5 mainframe computers and the associated input/output data interfaces; developed and installed a distributed data system with 81 workstations, 5 LANs, data drivers, and a fiber optic distribution subsystem; developed over 1.5 million lines of code to support new distributed system; developed new digital voice system which provides the MCC capacity to handle th Shuttle programs demands and growth potential to handle Space Station; replaced failing digital TV equipment with digital generation equipment; replaced obsolete center screen projector; and provided the platform for the multiprogram control center.", "title": "Space shuttle Mission Control Center upgrade", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920002797, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Duffin, Pat"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lyndon B.
