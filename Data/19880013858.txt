They were not able to develop a\nsuitable 6-DOFforce-moment transducer, however, so they recorded vibration\nlevels at the attachment points of each experiment and calculated the forces\nusing their knowledge of the dynamics of the experiment frame and the supporting structure.\nThis was not an accurate method because of the estimation\ninvolved in determining the dynamic characteristics\nof the structures.\nSome6-DOFtransducers have been developed that are apparently suitable for dynamic measurementof robot base reactions to the desired accuracy. The direct\nmeasurementof reactions is preferable and will be used in the demonstration.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SMALL SPACECRAFT ACCELERATIONS NOT A MAJOR CONCERN UNTIL THE ADVENT\nOF laG EXPERIMENTS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 REDUCING SOURCES OF FORCE IMPROVES laG ENVIRONMENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HOW CAN WE MEASURE SMALL DYNAMIC FORCES?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ACCELEROMETERS--REQUIRE PRECISE KNOWLEDGE OF DYNAMIC OF TEST ARTICLE\nAND SUPPORTING STRUCTURE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF FORCE USING 6DOF TRANSDUCER\n\nCD-88-31732\n\n1-224\n\nSIX-DOFTRANSDUCER\nCONSTRUCTION\nThe construction of a 6-DOFtransducer involves constructing a structure with\npredictable stiffness to forces applied at the attachment point and then\ninstrumenting it to determine the strain or displacement in enough (six minimum)directions to fully determine the load.\nStrut-type transducers attempt to resolve all forces and momentsinto purely\naxial loads in struts supporting an attachment flange (load application point).\nOne popular type of robust transducer uses eight flexures to measure the horizontal and vertical forces in perpendicular planes. This type may be stiff\nand strong but will have more crosstalk than a strut-type transducer.\nAny shape of flexure may be used, as long as at least six orthogonal components of displacement can be measured with sufficient\nresolution.\nThe previous types of fixtures are successful because they contain areas of high enough\nstrains to allow use of electrical\nresistance strain gages.\nHigh-precision displacement measurementtechniques may present opportunities\nto use unconventional flexure designs.\n\nMULTIPLE FLEXURE\n\nSTRUT TYPE TRANSDUCER\n\nTRANSDUCER\nCD-88-31735\n\n1-225\n\nBASEREACTION EASUREMENT\nM\n- DATAREDUCTION\nMeasurementof forces arising from the motions of the manipulator and its payload are complicated in an earth-bound laboratory by the presence of static\nloads due to gravity.\nIn the case of a manipulator, the static momentsin the\nplane of the floor (M and My) are determined by a nonlinear function of the\nx\njoint angles. This static component of the measured load must be subtracted\nfrom the total measured reaction:\nRt(t,@) = Rd(t) + Rs(e)\nwhere Rs(e) must be known for all\n\npossible points in the joint\n\nspace.\n\nThe interpolation error caused by using a lookup table with a reasonable\nnumber of points (<I0 000) will be excessive, so we need to develop an equation for the Rs(e). This equation is a function of e, having as parameters\nthe mass distribution\nof the arm segments. Wewill eliminate having to estimate the massdistributions\nby fitting\nan equation of the proper form to experimental data.\nThe present demonstration does not include real-time feedback of reaction,\nthis may be possible if processing resources are sufficient.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 STATIC BASE FORCES DUE TO GRAVITY MUST BE IGNORED\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GRAVITY MOMENT IS A NONLINEAR FUNCTION OF JOINT ANGLES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 NEED TO KNOW GRAVITY MOMENT AT ALL POINTS IN JOINT SPACE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LOOKUP TABLE IS IMPRACTICAL\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PARAMETERS IN EQUATIONS CANNOT BE EXACTLY DETERMINED ANALYTICALLY\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ANSWER: USE PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION TECHNIQUES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 EQUATIONS ARE COMPUTATION INTENSIVE...\nREAL-TIME REACTION FEEDBACK MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROCESSOR\n\nCD-88-31736\n\n1-226\n\nbut\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nANDBENEFITS\nThis demonstration will provide proof of concepts that will reduce robot base\nreactions by optimizing joint trajectory.\nAdditionally,\nit will contribute\nexperience with controls and hardware for microgravity manipulation to a knowledge base that will benefit designers of hardware for space experiments.\nThe force measurementsystem and computer system will be available after\n4-DOFdemonstration for research using other types of manipulators.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 KNOWLEDGE BASE WILL BENEFIT DESIGNERS WHO REQUIRE\nREACTION LIMITATION\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 FORCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM AND CONTROL DATA FACILITY\nWILL BE AVAILABLE TO TEST FUTURE MANIPULATORS AND\nACTUATORS\n\nCD-88-31737\n\n1-227\n\nthe\n\n'
