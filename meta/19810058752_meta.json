Selected propfan aircraft realized 21-percent fuel savings and 15-percent lower DOCs relative to advanced turbofan aircraft. While both the propfan and turbofan aircraft satisfied current federal noise regulations, the propfan aircraft had smaller noiseprints at 90-EPNdB noise levels but larger noiseprints at lower noise levels. Several techniques for reducing the propfan aircraft noiseprints were explored; some of these contribute substantial reductions in noiseprint areas. Also, a propfan aircraft for the C-X role was studied.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19810058752, "endDate": "1981-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "73a1779ab4014861bd62ef813c4aac6e", "id": "b5d0a6e797fe426cbbbaffdc78f99e5f"}], "name": "Aircraft Systems and Technology Conference", "location": "Dayton, OH", "id": "73a1779ab4014861bd62ef813c4aac6e", "startDate": "1981-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810058752, "id": "022b71e3bdee4dc396cc0c9f5c440e23", "publicationDate": "1981-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
