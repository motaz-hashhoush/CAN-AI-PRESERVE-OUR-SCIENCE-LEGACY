Called the Model 206AU, the system is lightweight and portable. It is comprised of three sections. The \"pulser\" section injects ultrasonic waves into the material under test. A receiver picks up the simulated stress waves as they pass through the material and relays the signals to the acoustic emission section, where they are electronically analyzed.", "title": "Testing Composites", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030005016, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030005016, "id": "255eca250e994f1f9267e90025813df5", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1981", "publicationDate": "1981-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030005016.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030005016/downloads/20030005016.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030005016/downloads/20030005016.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030005016/downloads/20030005016.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
