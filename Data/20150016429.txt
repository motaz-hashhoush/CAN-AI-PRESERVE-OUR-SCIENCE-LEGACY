properties are established for selections from a large master list of launch\nvehicle systems, subsystems, propellants and fluids.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mass calculations are based on mass estimating relationships (MERs) that are\nautomatically generated from a large database of MERs that is built into the\nprogram.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Program mass calculation accuracy for existing and historical launch vehicles\nhas been verified to be well within 5%.\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 LVA is a MSFC-developed tool that provides fast launch vehicle\nstructural design and analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It supplies detailed analysis by using time proven engineering methods based\non material properties, load factors, aerodynamic loads, stress, elastic stability,\ndeflection, etc.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This tool and its predecessors have been in use at MSFC for over 25 years.\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 POST is an industry-standard trajectory optimization tool.\n\xef\x81\xb5 Once a candidate configuration is developed in INTROS, these tools\nare used iteratively to converge on viable design solutions.\n\nHow Has Use of M&S Helped SLS Early?\n\xef\x81\xb5 Prior to SRR/SDR, analyzed items such as these using

The model is needed anyway; the requirements are not.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Avoids the experience of having a system design that works, models that\naccurately show its behavior, but having to negotiate what the detailed\nrequirements should be and how to verify them.\n\xe2\x80\x92 e.g. TVC model works, but in standard approach would negotiate detailed TVC\n\nrequirements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduces resulting conservatism\n24\n\nKey Points used in determining which\nParameters to Elevate to a Requirement\n\xef\x81\xb5 If the System is Sensitive to the Model Parameter Limits and the\nLimits are a design driver, ELEVATE\n\xef\x81\xb5 Not elevating a Model Parameter saves resources\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determining the \xe2\x80\x98hard\xe2\x80\x99 limits for parameters can be an intensive analytical\neffort\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Debates on adequate margin included in a requirement can be prolonged\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Each additional requirement adds documentation and tracking\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 The program accepts the additional Risk when a requirement is not\nelevated\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cost/Schedule Risk if we have to set a new requirement to get a model\nparameter \xe2\x80\x9cback in the box\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Or technical risk of accepting the model parameter as is\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\n04_J.Hutt_SRB STEP 2 Kickoff.25\n\nExamples of which model parameters are\nelevated to requirements\nElevated to Requirements\n\nModel Output Parameters\n\nMass Properties\n\nDry Mass, Prop Load Limits\n-Rationale: directly affects SLS\nrequirements, clear limits\nknown\n\nTime dependent Cg\nRationale: Vehicle can\naccommodate multiple\nsolutions, just needs to know\nthe correct values\n\nThrust Vector Control\n\nCore Stage Gimbal range and\nrate\nRationale: Limits are significant\ndriver in Core Stage design\nand limits are needed for\ndesign to proceed\n\nBooster Gimbal range and\nrate:\nRationale: Parameters are\nbased on heritage and little risk\nthat model outputs will become\nunacceptable.\n\nInertial Navigation System\n\nVehicle Position Accuracy\nRationale: INS design and the\nnavigation accuracy are highly\nsensitive to this parameter and\nlimits are needed for design to\nproceed.\n\nVehicle Position\nRationale: Producing this\noutput is part of the functional\ndesign definition of the INS\nand an auditable parameter\n\nInertial Navigation System Example\nTraditional Requirements\nfor INS System could result\nin 230 Shall Statements\n\n\xef\x81\xb5Anti-Aliasing Filter Implementation Model in Code\nModel Input Data:\nTF_method\n\nenableTFdyn_w\nomega_w_hz\nzeta_w\nTF_T_w_hz\nenableTFdyn_a\nomega_a_hz\nzeta_a\nTF_T_a_hz\n\n\xef\x81\xb5Requirements for antialiasing portion:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The inertial measurements\nshall be anti-aliased\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-alias filter shall have a\nbandwidth of 29.5 Hz\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-alias filter shall execute\nat a minimum sample\nfrequency of 250 Hz\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-alias filter shall have a\nmaximum phase lag of 5\ndegrees at 1 Hz.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-alias filter shall have a\nmaximum gain of +/- 2e-3 dB\nat 1 Hz\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anti-alias filter shall have a\nminimum attenuation of 6 dB\nat 20 Hz\n\n3\n\n1\n29.5\n0.6\n250.0\n1\n26.5\n0.6\n250.0\n\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n\n2nd order TF method:\n1) continuous with Euler integration,\n2) continuous using MAVERIC integration,\n3) discrete with Tustin transform\nenable 2nd order transfer function\nGyro bandwidth frequency (Hs)\nsecond order damping factor\nSampling freq for discrete filter (Hz)\nenable 2nd order transfer function\nAccel bandwidth frequency (Hz)\nsecond order damping factor\nsampling frequency for discrete filter (Hz)\n\n}\n\n\xef\x81\xb5 Implementation in Code \xe2\x80\x93 little ambiguity in intent or\nassumptions\n\xef\x81\xb5 Alternate implementations are available.

Using the approach of\nmany detailed requirements, the contractor is led to a\nspecific INS solution or has to change many\nrequirements in order to change the system. With the\nmodel-based approach, if the new model meets the\nvehicle needs, changing to the new system is much\neasier.\n\n31\n\nModels May Not Work Best in All Cases\n\xef\x81\xb5 For example, slosh damping requirements\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Model is a complicated characterization of slosh behavior\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Requirement characterization is simple, and exceeding the required value is all\nthat is needed (see figure)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A model is still necessary\n\nLOX DAMPING RATIO\n\nPredicted LOX\nDamping Ratio\n\nRequired Minimum\nDamping Ratio\n\nFLUID LEVEL FROM BOTTOM OF TANK, INCHES\n\nThe Design Model Delivery Standard\n\xef\x81\xb5 SLS-STD-038 uses a streamlined subset of the Credibility Assessment Factors\ndefined in the NASA Modeling and Simulation Standard (NASA-STD-7009)\n\xef\x81\xb5 Model verification and validation, for this specific use, are thus established and\nuncertainties reported before a model is baselined\n\xef\x81\xb5 Reassessed with each model delivery or update\n\n8/25/2015\n\nDesign Models Meta Data\n\xef\x81\xb5 The meta data controlled with the design models\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bookkeeping (Identifier, Version, Release Date, Model Name, SLS\nElement/Subsystem, Dependencies on other models, Milestone applicability)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Statement of Intended Use\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Technical Description of Model spells out the required system inputs, outputs,\ntest cases\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Assumptions\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Operational Phase (applicability)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Verification\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Validation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Results Uncertainty (identifies and quantifies uncertainty of model output)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Results Robustness\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Limitations (provides boundaries on the set of parameters for which a model result\nis valid)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Input Pedigree (includes the uncertainty of input data)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use History\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Conservatism\n\xe2\x80\x92 So that an evaluation can be performed when the design is sensitive to the model, and so\n\nthat conservatism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get piled on top of conservatism.\n\nConclusion\n\xef\x81\xb5 Modeling and Simulation has enabled SLS to\n\xe2\x80\xa2Reduce cost\n\xe2\x80\xa2Find issues sooner\n\xe2\x80\xa2Provide higher fidelity results\n\xe2\x80\xa2Allow more design flexibility\n\xe2\x80\xa2Reduce excess conservatism\n\xe2\x80\xa2Provide for increased mission success and crew safety\n\n'
