The capability of the computer code to resolve the flow near solid surfaces without using a wall function assumption was demonstrated. In view of the complex nature of the flow field in the vicinity of the slot, this approach is considered essential. The results obtained from these calculations provide valuable design information, which would otherwise be extremely difficult to obtain. The results of the axisymmetric calculations indicate the presence of a region of reversed axial flow at the aft-edge of the slot and show the over-pressure in the slot to be only about 10 psi. The results of the asymmetric calculations indicate that a pressure asymmetry more than two diameters downstream of the slot has no noticeable effect on the flow field in the slot. They also indicate that the circumferential pressure differential caused in the slot due to failure of a 15 deg section of the castable inhibitor will be approximately 1 psi.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880015291, "id": "3222b805d97448d7a6848a709a0a4435", "publicationDate": "1987-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880015291.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880015291/downloads/19880015291.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880015291/downloads/19880015291.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880015291/downloads/19880015291.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
