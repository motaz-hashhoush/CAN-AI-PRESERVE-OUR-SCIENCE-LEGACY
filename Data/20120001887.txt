b'Software Innovations Speed Scientific Computing\nNASA Technology\n\nW\n\nhat causes the Sun to change? And what\nare the impacts on our planet and our daily\nlives?\nThese are some of the top questions that the\nHeliophysics Division of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Science Mission\nDirectorate is seeking answers to through a variety of\nmissions to study the Sun. The most recent, the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO), launched in 2010, beams\nback 150 million bits of data per second\xe2\x80\x94almost 50\ntimes more science data than any other mission in NASA\nhistory. As a result, SDO\xe2\x80\x99s instruments are giving solar\nscientists an unprecedented look at the Sun.\nOn a similar mission, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Reuven Ramaty High\nEnergy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) launched\nin 2002 to gather a wealth of data to construct images\nof the Sun. To create meaningful visualizations out of\nthe vast data, much of it has been deciphered using a\ncomputer programming language called Interactive Data\nLanguage (IDL). In addition to studying the Sun, there\nis widespread use of IDL throughout NASA to process\ndata, analyze images, perform computations, and make\nsimulation models.\nAs NASA missions continue to produce an increased\namount of data, and as computational procedures become\nincreasingly complex, NASA requires ever greater computing power.\n\nPartnership\nTo help reduce the time needed to analyze data from\nmissions like those studying the Sun, Goddard Space\nFlight Center awarded a Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) contract in 2004 to Tech-X Corporation\nof Boulder, Colorado.\nThrough Phase I and II SBIRs, Tech-X demonstrated\nsoftware capable of running IDL applications on linked\ncomputers, or cluster systems. The computers worked\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are very innovative people on\nthe Agency side who see the potential of\ntechnologies and, in collaboration with\nsmall businesses, can make leading-edge\ntechnologies happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94Peter Messmer, Tech-X Corporation\ntogether to form a single system, without requiring significant modification to the original program.\nBy enabling IDL to work on clusters, Tech-X created\na technology that increased performance in a familiar\nprogramming environment for NASA scientists, while\nreducing the time needed to analyze large amounts of\ndata. Today, this software is available in Tech-X\xe2\x80\x99s commercial product called FastDL.\nAfter the demonstration of FastDL for NASA, something unexpected happened. \xe2\x80\x9cToward the end of the\nPhase II SBIR, we started to redirect the proposal to\ninvestigate the usability of graphics processing units to\nhelp scientists accelerate their data analysis tasks,\xe2\x80\x9d explains\nPeter Messmer, vice president of the space applications\ngroup at Tech-X. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the beginning of the GPULib\nproduct that we are now offering at Tech-X.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the time, graphics processing units (GPUs) were\nmainly used for 3D gaming graphics, but the technology\nwas becoming more commonly used to accelerate scientific computing. Messmer says Tech-X wanted to use one\npiece of hardware\xe2\x80\x94a GPU\xe2\x80\x94rather than several pieces, to\nmake the computations faster.\nToday, Tech-X attributes the initial development of\nGPULib, which makes available a library of mathematical functions to facilitate the use of GPUs for scientific\ncomputing, to its work with NASA. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are very innovative people on the Agency side who see the potential\nof technologies and, in collaboration with small businesses, can make leading-edge technologies happen,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nMessmer.\n\n142\t Information Technology\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nSpinoff 2011\n\nBy 2008, NASA scientists were using Tech-X\xe2\x80\x99s parallel\ncomputing tools to process large quantities of visual data\nfrom the RHESSI mission 10\xe2\x80\x9340 times faster than they\ncould previously. In applying FastDL to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory, Tech-X processed data more\nthan seven times faster on a cluster of 12 processors.\nOver the past 5 years, government contracts and\nproducts including FastDL and GPULib have helped the\ncompany to double its number of headquarters employees\nto 70. Commercially available for 6 years, FastDL has\nearned about $90,000 in revenue for Tech-X. GPULib,\navailable for 2 years, has earned about $100,000 in\nrevenue.\nMessmer says that what makes these products so\nunique is that they target IDL, which is widely used by\nengineers, scientists, analysts, and other technical professionals in satellite, medical, and astrophysical imaging.\nUsing FastDL, scientists and developers can run IDL\nvisualization and analyses applications using several computers at once to shorten the time required to get results.\nBecause not every visualization and analysis problem can\nbe solved using the same parallel computing paradigm,\nFastDL includes two components: TaskDL (for independent computations) and mpiDL (for interdependent\ncomputations).\nThe other NASA-derived product, GPULib, supplies a\nmathematical library that simplifies access to parallel computing on a GPU. It brings high-performance numerical\noperations to everyday desktop computers with an easyto-use interface. According to Tech-X, the time it takes\nfor implementations of common mathematical operations\nis 5\xe2\x80\x9340 times faster using the technology.\n\nAvailable under two licensing arrangements, Messmer\nsays there have been close to 10,000 downloads of\nGPULib from Tech-X\xe2\x80\x99s website.\nScientists in a variety of fields can benefit from\nthe increased execution speed allowed by GPULib in\napplication areas such as structural and fluid mechanics,\nEarth sciences, biosciences, medical and diagnostic\nimaging, and financial engineering. Current applications\nfor simulation and modeling include computational fluid\ndynamics, tsunami modeling, galaxy formation, and\nneural-tissue simulations. In data analysis, applications\ninclude image enhancement, deblurring, real-time image\nprocessing, hyperspectral imaging, astronomical imaging,\nmedical imaging, and seismic data processing.\nAt the Department of Radiation Oncology at Loyola\nUniversity in Maywood, Illinois, the software is used for\naligning patients on a treatment table before and after\nX-ray imaging, a computationally-demanding application that needs to be performed quickly. John Roeske,\nDirector of Radiation Physics at the university, says,\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrdinarily, the approach would take 5\xe2\x80\x9310 seconds.\nUsing the GPULib we feel we can get the alignment to\nbetter than a second.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlongside medical imaging, Tech-X is focusing on\nproviding custom products for applications in remote\nsensing and gaming. \xe2\x80\x9cThe future as we see it is to provide\ndomain-specific programs for different applications,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nMessmer.\nWhat will come next? And what are the impacts on\nprocessing speed?\nThese are some of the top questions that Tech-X is\nseeking answers to through additional SBIRs with NASA\nto reveal more about Earth and the universe. v\n\nNASA requires increased computing power to process\nimages like this one of the Sun, created by the Solar\nDynamics Observatory in September of 2010.\n\nSpinoff 2011\t\n\nInformation Technology \t 143\n\nInformation\nTechnology\n\nBenefits\n\n'
