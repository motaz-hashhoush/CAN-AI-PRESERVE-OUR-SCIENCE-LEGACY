Before I go into details of\nmy experiences at Swamp Works, I would like to take a moment to explain what I discovered Swamp\nWorks to be. Swamp Works is a family of hardworking, dedicated, and driven people from various\nbackgrounds and skill sets. These people all work to advance technologies and make science fiction\nscience fact through means of rapid prototyping. They support and encourage failure as an option when\nlearning new things, as long as lesson learned from said failure. In fact, their motto states "Fail, Fast,\nForward." What this means is, not if but when one fails he or she must do so quickly and spring forward\nfrom the failure so that his or her progress is not delayed. With this acceptance, it provided me the\nconfidence to dive into a multitude of projects working in various fields and with a wide range of skill\nsets.\nThe first project I joined was Badger. My motivation for taking on this project was the\nopportunity I would have to obtain valuable experience working with 3D modeling and 3D printing\ntechnologies. Badger was a digging apparatus to be used in a highly dusty environment in a material\nknown as Regolith. Regolith is a scientific term for the dirt or top soil found on planetary bodies.\nRegolith contains a large quantity of sediments less than lOppm and as a result poses a challenge of\nkeeping it out of any cracks and crevices. Furthermore, regolith can create high levels of electrostatic\nenergy, which can prove damaging to sensitive electrical hardware. With these characteristics in mind, I\ndecided to take on the task of designing and manufacturing a dust proof cover for the sensitive electrical\nhardware. When I began this project, I did not have the slightest idea as to how to use 3D modeling\nsoftware or a means of manufacturing a viable product. As I went along with variants of the design, I\nbecame very proficient with a 3D modeling program known as CREO 2.0. Upon completion of my 3D\ndesign, I then had the task of manufacturing and having, in my hands, a usable model. To do this I had to\nwork with additive printing technologies also known as 3D printing. Through my experiences working\nwith Badger, I realized that 3D modeling is the focal point in much of engineering. With this in mind, I\nhave embraced this fact and decided to further my experience with this software so that I may become\na more valuable asset to any firm later in my career.\nMid-way through work with Badger, I picked up another project in which I found much interest. I\nha~\n\nthe opportunity to work side by side with a materials and composites guru in manufacturing carbon\n\ncomposite coupons (test strips) for performing stress, strain, and sheer analysis on. Being from a surfing,\nkiteboarding, and other water sport background I have always been interested in board design. With\nthis in mind, it is no wonder why I found interest in such a project. I had the opportunity to refine Mold\npreparatory, composite layup, and composite curing techniques. Following manufacturing of these\ncomposite strips, I then performed various stress tests and logged my results. With these results, future\nteams could create lighter, stronger, and more cost effective composite structures for use in varieties of\napplications. After my experiences with materials and composites testing, I have obtained crucial\n\nappreciation for detailed documentation and analysis that material sciences involve. However, as\ninteresting as composite materials testing has been, I do not feel this is where my future career lies.\nAnother, more on the side, project I have been involved in is building a 626 cubic foot regolith\ncontainment chamber for doing full scale testing of robotic systems. This chamber is built of high\nstrength aluminum scaffold materials, 80/20, and massive panels of Lexan. Once the chamber is\ncompleted, it is be filled with 120 tons of regolith and dubbed the largest regolith test chamber in the\nworld. Through my experiences with building "Big Bin" as we called it, I discovered my demand for\nengaging and hands on activities.\nThrough all of my incredible experiences working with the Swamp Works at Kennedy Space\nCenter; I have obtained crucial knowledge, insights, and experiences that have fuelled, shaped, and will\ncontinue to drive me toward my ultimate goal of obtaining not only a degree in Engineering, but\nobtaining a job that I can call a career. I want to give much thanks to all of those who mentored me\nalong my journey, and to all who made this opportunity a reality.\n\n'
