The Laser Thermal Control System (LTCS) is designed to maintain the lasers onboard Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) at their operational temperatures. In order to verify the functionality of the LTCS, a thermal balance test of the thermal hardware was performed. During the first cold start of the LTCS, the Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) was unable to control the laser mass simulators temperature. The control heaters were fully on and the loop temperature remained well below the desired setpoint. Thermal analysis of the loop did not show these results. This unpredicted behavior of the LTCS was brought up to a panel of LHP experts. Based on the testing and a review of all the data, there were multiple diagnostic performed in order to narrow down the cause. The prevailing theory is that gravity is causing oscillating flow within the loop, which artificially increased the control power needs. This resulted in a replan of the LTCS test flow and the addition of a GSE heater to allow vertical operation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140009179, "endDate": "2014-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Corp.", "location": "El Segundo, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ed0ccd0711ad41769ab27fb6a4ddc940", "id": "2e3ae2798310443fa6477a955e25ea01"}], "name": "Spacecraft Thermal Control Workshop", "location": "El Segundo, CA", "id": "ed0ccd0711ad41769ab27fb6a4ddc940", "startDate": "2014-03-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140009179, "id": "ca6f1232d8104c37a41f199525341dcd", "publicationDate": "2014-03-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140009179.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140009179/downloads/20140009179.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140009179/downloads/20140009179.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140009179/downloads/20140009179.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
