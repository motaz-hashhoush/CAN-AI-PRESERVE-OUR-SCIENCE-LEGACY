SERVIR, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/ United States Agency for International Development (USAID) joint program strives to \u201cconnect space to village\u201d and to reduce through the use of geospatial technology and data. Partnerships with organizations, such as Mercy Corps, are important for connecting to the village level and ensuring that our work is benefiting the most vulnerable communities. Mercy Corps is a global non-governmental, humanitarian and development organization operating in transitional contexts that have undergone, or have been undergoing, various forms of economic, environmental, social and political instabilities. Through the Mercy Corps and SERVIR partnership, we are able to bring together the remote sensing and geospatial technology expertise of SERVIR and the on-the-ground expertise of Mercy Corps. In this talk we will provide additional background of this partnership as well as provide examples of how we have collaborated thus far in the partnership. The partnership spans engagement from connecting one another with our various partners to in-depth collaboration on specific projects. Additionally, we will discuss some of the various goals and outcomes of the partnership that help frame our work together in the present and future.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180008669, "endDate": "2018-12-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU)", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "51289f672c394d43905fb56d24885ad7", "id": "dff84b886ce2461a9e28c060afbc1f9a"}], "name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "51289f672c394d43905fb56d24885ad7", "startDate": "2018-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180008669, "id": "c3fccb8ab5f1490a96647cc032deaf9c", "publicationDate": "2018-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180008669.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180008669/downloads/20180008669.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180008669/downloads/20180008669.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180008669/downloads/20180008669.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
