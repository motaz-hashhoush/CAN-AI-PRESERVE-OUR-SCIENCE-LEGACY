invention\nfully assembled. This figure shows the first flange 1, the outer\nhousing 2, the handle 3, and the screws 4 that secure the first\nflange 1 to the inner housing 5 (not shown). The handle 3 is\npreferably secured to the outer housing 2 with screws (not\nshown). This figure also shows the threaded aperture 6 in the\nfirst flange 1. The threaded aperture 6 preferably has an inner\ndiameter of 0.5 inches.\nFIG. 1 also shows the outer stop 7 on the first flange 1 and\nthe recess 8 in the outer housing 2 in which the outer stop 7\ntravels. As the handle 3 is turned, the outer housing 2 rotates\nwith respect to the inner housing 5 and first and second\nflanges 1, 9 (both of which are fixedly attached to the inner\nhousing 5), and the outer stop 7 moves in a clockwise or\ncounterclockwise direction (depending on which way the\nhandle 3 is turned) within the recess 8 in the outer housing 2.\nThe recess 8 preferably extends roughly ninety degrees) (90\xc2\xb0)\naround the perimeter of the outer housing 2 (the recess actually extends ninety degrees) (90\xc2\xb0) plus the width of the external stop 7). The outer stop 7 and recess 8 prevent the handle 3\nfrom being turned (and the valve rotating) more than ninety\ndegrees (90\xc2\xb0), which is important because it prevents the\ntravel pins 27 from being dislodged from the channel 28 in the\nguide sleeve 22, 23 that encircles the ball 11 (see FIG. 11).\nFIG. 2 is a rear perspective view of the present invention\nfully assembled. This figure shows the second flange 9, the\nouter housing 2, the handle 3, and the screws 4 that secure the\nsecond flange 9 to the inner housing 5 (not shown). A collar 10\n\n8\nlies between the inner housing 5 and the outer housing 2\ndirectly beneath the second flange 9. The second flange 9 also\nhas a threaded aperture 6, which preferably has an inner\ndiameter of 0.5 inches. The threaded apertures 6 in the first\n5 and second flanges 1, 9 allow the valve to be hooked up to\nstandard piping.\nFIG. 3 is a front view of the present invention with the valve\nfully open. As shown in subsequent figures, a ball 11 lies\nbetween the first and second flanges 1, 9, with a ball seal 12 on\nto either side of the ball 11 (see FIG. 19). Axis pins 13 secure the\nball 11 in place inside of an inner magnetic cartridge 14 that\nlies inside of the inner housing 5 (see FIGS. 10 and 11). When\nthe handle 3 is turned, the inner housing 5 and first and second\n15 flanges 1, 9 remain stationary, but the outer housing 2 (which\ncomprises a plurality of magnets) rotates with the handle 3\nand causes the inner magnetic cartridge 14 to rotate as well.\nThe inner magnetic cartridge 14 in turn causes the ball 11 to\nrotate. This mechanism is illustrated more fully in subsequent\n20 figures.\nFIG. 4 is a front view of the present invention with the valve\npartially closed. As shown in this figure, the external stop 7\nhas moved forty-five degrees) (45\xc2\xb0) in a clockwise direction\nin the recess 8 in the outer housing 2. Similarly, the handle 3\n25 has been moved forty-five degrees) (45\xc2\xb0) in a clockwise\ndirection. The rotation of the handle 3 causes the ball 11 to\nrotate, thereby partially closing the valve.\nFIG. 5 is a front view of the present invention with the valve\nfully closed. The handle 3 has now rotated ninety degrees)\nso (90\xc2\xb0) in a clockwise direction, as has the external stop 7 in the\nrecess 8 in the outer housing 2. Thus, the handle 3 cannot\nrotate any further in this direction. (Similarly, when rotated in\nthe other direction, the external stop 7 will prevent the handle\n3 from being rotated more than ninety degrees (90\xc2\xb0)). The\n35 valve is now in a closed position, with the ball 11 fully\ncovering the opening between the two flanges. The dotted\nlines illustrate the perimeter of the ball 1 and the channel 15\nin the ball 11. When the valve is open (either fully or partially), fluid is allowed to travel through the channel 15 in the\n4o ball 11. When the valve is fully closed, fluid is prevented from\npassing from one flange to the other by virtue of the fact that\nthe ball 11 is rotated so that the channel 15 is not aligned with\nthe ramps 16 in the flanges (see FIGS. 16 and 17) and also\nbecause of the ball seals 12 on either side of the ball 11 (see\n45 FIG. 19).\nFIG. 6 is a rear view of the present invention with the valve\nfully open. In this figure, the valve is in the same position as\nshown in FIG. 3.\nFIG. 7 is a rear view of the present invention with the valve\n50 partially closed. In this figure, the valve is in the same position\nas shown in FIG. 4.\nFIG. 8 is a rear view of the present invention with the valve\nfully closed. In this figure, the valve is in the same position as\nshown in FIG. 5.\n55\nFIG. 9 is anexplodedview ofthe present invention with the\nfirst flange and first and second journal bearings removed. In\nthis particular embodiment, the first journal bearing 17 lies\nbetween the inner housing 5 and the first flange 1, and the\nsecond journal bearing 18 lies between the inner magnetic\n60 cartridge 14 and the first flange 1; however, the present invention is not limited to any particular number or configuration of\njournal bearings. Journal bearings are used as necessary to\nalleviate friction between the various moving parts.\nFIG. 9 shows the internal stop 19 located on the removable\n65 magnetic cartridge 14. The mechanism of the internal stop 19\nis illustrated in FIG. 32. FIG.9 also shows one of the two axis\npins 13 about which the ball 11 rotates. It also shows one of\n\nUS 8,132,786 B2\n9\n\n10\n\nthe two ball seals 12 on either side of the ball 11 (see FIGS. 16\nnot the same), they could be symmetrical (i.e., identical).
