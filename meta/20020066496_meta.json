High-temperature oxidation-resistant thruster materials are being produced in order to achieve high-temperature capability without sacrificing reliability. These thruster materials lead to an estimated three-percent improvement in propulsion system performance. To develop this material, Ultramet used a process called chemical vapor deposition (CVD). CVD involves heating precursors for metals, like iridium and rhenium, to temperatures at which they become gaseous. They are then deposited onto a mandrel, or spindle, layer-by-layer to produce high-density, highly resistant materials from the inside out.", "title": "Giving Bigger Satellites a Boost", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020066496, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020066496, "isbn": "0-16-050462-7", "id": "31239f606dc34c80ae3557295c563ce6", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2000", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020066496.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020066496/downloads/20020066496.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020066496/downloads/20020066496.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020066496/downloads/20020066496.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
