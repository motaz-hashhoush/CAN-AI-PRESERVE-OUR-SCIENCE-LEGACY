In particular, we discuss a new iterative approach for describing the dynamics of\nan isolated astronomical N-body system in metric theories of gravity. To do this, we generalize\nthe Fock-Chandrasekhar method of the weak-field and slow-motion approximation (WFSMA)\nand develop a theory of relativistic reference frames (RFs) for a gravitationally bounded\nmany-extended-body problem. In any proper RF constructed in the immediate vicinity of\nan arbitrary body, the N-body solutions of the gravitational field equations are formally\npresented as a sum of the Riemann-flat inertial space-time, the gravitational field generated\nby the body itself, the unperturbed solutions for each body in the system transformed to the\ncoordinates of this proper RF, and the gravitational interaction term. We develop the basic\nconcept of a general WFSMA theory of the celestial RFs applicable to a wide class of metric\ntheories of gravity and an arbitrary model of matter distribution.\nWe apply the proposed method to general relativity. Celestial bodies are described using a perfect fluid model; as such, they possess any number of internal mass and current\nmultipole moments that explicitly characterize their internal structures. The obtained relativistic corrections to the geodetic equations of motion arise because of a coupling of the\nbodies\' multiple moments to the surrounding gravitational field. The resulting relativistic\ntransformations between the different RFs extend the Poincare group to the motion of deformable self-gravitating bodies. Within the present accuracy of astronomical measurements\nwe discuss the properties of the Fermi-normal-like proper RF that is defined in the immediate\nvicinity of the extended compact bodies. We further generalize the proposed approximation\nmethod and include two Eddington parameters (7, /?). This generalized approach was used\nto derive the relativistic equations of satellite motion in the vicinity of the extended bodies.\nAnticipating improvements in radio and laser tracking technologies over the next few decades,\nwe apply this method to spacecraft orbit determination. We emphasize the number of feasible relativistic gravity tests that may be performed within the context of the parameterized\nWFSMA. Based on the planeto-centric equations of motion of a spacecraft around the planet,\nwe suggested a new null test of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). The experiment to\nmeasure the corresponding SEP violation effect could be performed with the future Mercury\nOrbiter mission. We discuss other relativistic effects, including the perihelion advance and\nthe redshift and geodetic precession of the or biter\'s orbital plane about Mercury, as well as\nthe possible future implementation of the proposed formalism in software codes developed for\nsolar-system orbit determination. All the important calculations are completely documented,\nand the references contain an extensive list of cited literature.\n\nIll\n\n"PAGE MISSING FROM AVAILABLE VERSION"\n\nContents\n0 Notations and Definitions\n1 Introduction and Overview\n1.1 The Motivation and the Structure of the Report\n1.2 The Problem of Relativistic Astronomical Measurements\n1.3 The Qualitative Description of the Astronomical Systems of Interest\n1.4 Different Methods of Constructing the Proper RF\n2 Parametrized Post-Newtonian Metric Gravity\n2.1 An Isolated One-Body Problem\n2.2 The Limitations of the Standard PPN Formalism\n2.2.1 The Simplified Lagrangian Function of an Isolated N-Body System ...\n2.2.2 The Simplified Barycentric Equations of Motion\n3 WFSMA for an Isolated Astronomical N-Body System\n3.1 The General Form of the N-Body Solution\n<.\n3.2 The Post-Newtonian KLQ Parameterization\n3.2.1 The Properties of the Coordinate Transformations in the WFSMA ...\n3.2.2 The Inverse Transformations\n3.2.3 The Coordinate Transformations Between the Two Proper RFs\n3.2.4 Notes on an Arbitrary Rotation of the Spatial Axes\n3.3 The Definition of the Proper RF\n4 General Relativity: Solutions for the Field Equations\n4.1 The Solution for the Interaction Term\n4.2 The Solution of the Field Equations in the Proper RF\n4.3 Decomposition of the Fields in the Proper RF\n5 General Relativity: Transformations to the Proper RF\n5.1 Finding the Functions KA and Q^\n5.1.1 Equations for the Functions KA and Q^\n5.1.2 The Solution for the Function KA\n5.1.3 The Solution for the Function Q%\n5.2 Finding the Function LA\n5.2.1 Equations for the Function LA\n5.2.2 The Solution for the Function LA\n5.3 Equations of Motion for the Massive Bodies\n5.4 The Proper RF of the Small Self-Gravitating Body\n5.5 The Fermi-Normal-Like Coordinates\n6 General Relativity: The Proper RF for the Extended Body\n6.1 The Extended-Body Generalization\n6.2 Conservation Laws in the Proper RF\n6.3 The Solution for the Function 6w%0\n7 Parameterized Proper RF\n7.1 Parameterized Coordinate Transformations\n7.2 Equations of the Spacecraft Motion\n7.3 Gravitational Experiment for Post-2000 Missions\n7.3.1 Mercury\'s Perihelion Advance\n7.3.2 The Redshift Experiment\n7.3.3 The SEP Violation Effect\n7.3.4 The Precession Phenomena\n\n1\n1\n1\n7\n18\n21\n27\n27\n29\n30\n32\n35\n35\n39\n40\n41\n43\n44\n46\n51\n51\n57\n59\n63\n64\n64\n64\n66\n68\n68\n70\n72\n73\n77\n81\n81\n88\n96\n99\n99\n103\n107\n109\n110\n110\n112\n\n8 Discussion: Relativistic Astronomical RFs.\n8.1 The Geocentric Proper RF\n8.2 The Satellite Proper RF\n8.3 The Topocentric Proper RF\n8.4 Discussion\nAppendix A: Generalized Gravitational Potentials\nAppendix B: Power Expansions of the General Geometric Quantities\nB.I.

This is usually done by measuring the spacecraft\'s coordinates and then by correcting\n(fitting and adjusting) the predicted spacecraft trajectory using those measurements. There are\nthree different types of measurements that are used in spacecraft navigation: radiometric (range\nand Doppler), very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), and optical (Standish, 1995). As well\nas serving navigational needs, high precision Doppler and laser and radio range measurements\nof the velocity of and the distance to celestial bodies and spacecraft are presently the best ways\nto collect important information about relativistic gravity within the solar system. Combined\nwith the technique of ground- and space-based VLBI, these methods provide us with a unique\nopportunity to explore the physical phenomena in our universe with very high precision. Most\nremarkable is the increase in accuracy of the modern VLBI observations, especially in applications\nto problems of modern geodesy (Soffel et al., 1991; Herring, 1995). Thus, the delay residuals\nare presently of the order of 30-50 picoseconds (ps), which corresponds to an uncertainty in\nlength of ~ 1 cm. In the navigation of interplanetary spacecraft, the short arcs of spacecraft\nrange and Doppler measurements, reduced with Earth orientation information referred to the\nInternational Earth Rotation Service\'s (IERS) celestial system, lead to a position determination\nin the extragalactic RF with an accuracy on the order of ~ 20 milliarcseconds (mas). At the\nsame time, the VLBI observations of the spacecraft with respect to an extragalactic radio source\nenable one to measure directly one component of the spacecraft position in this extragalactic RF\nto an accuracy of about ~ 5 mas (Border et ai, 1982; Folkner et al, 1994). As a result, the\n\nuse of such precise methods enables one to study the dynamics of celestial bodies and spacecraft\nwith an unprecedented accuracy.\nIn addition to these line-of-sight methods, the computer revolution of the 1990\'s has revived\ninterest in the classical approach for determining the gravity field based on the spherical harmonics representation. It is now believed that the use of spherical harmonics to high degree\nand order, where only high frequency noise is present in the raw Doppler residuals, is one of\nthe best reduction approaches because it allows a fully three-dimensional analysis. Thus, the\ngravitational spherical harmonics of the Earth gravity field are currently known up to the 70th\ndegree and order for the solutions based upon the spacecraft tracking data only, and to the 360th\ndegree and order with surface measurements included (Rapp et al, 1991; Nerem et al., 1995).\nLet us mention that currently there exists the possibility of determining the Venus gravity field\nto 120th degree and order (Konopliv et al., 1995). It should be noted that the determination\nof the multipolar structure of the Newtonian gravitational field of the Earth and planets with\nsuch high resolution and accuracy enables one to take into account the relativistic corrections to\nthe gravitational field of these bodies. Then, by using modern techniques of data reduction, one\nmay generate highly precise solutions that have applications beyond that of serving the geodetic\nneeds (Hellings, 1986; Herring, 1996). For example, these very important results are widely in\nuse as the necessary foundation for studies of many modern scientific problems, such as\n(i). The problem of developing a more precise definition of the masses and the multipole structure of the Sun, Earth, other planets, their satellites, and asteroids (Standish, 1992; Standish, 1994; Schubert et al., 1994; Konopliv et al., 1995).\n(ii). The establishment of better values for gravitational and other astronomical constants, as\nwell as the testing of the hypothesis of their dependence on time that was predicted by a\nnumber of modern theories of gravity (Dirac, 1937; Anderson et al., 1986; Will, 1993).\n(iii). The study of the dynamics and the evolution of the solar system, aimed at a better understanding of its metrological characteristics. This will help to solve some cosmogonical\nproblems, such as determining whether or not there is a second asteroid belt (the Kuiper\nbelt) behind the Saturnian orbit (Anderson et al., 1986), giving better numerical estimates\nof the quantity of dark matter in the solar system (Braginsky, 1994; Anderson, et al., 1995),\nand determining whether or not our Sun has a companion star.\n(iv). Experimental tests of modern gravitational theories in the WFSMA (Damour, 1983; Will,\n1993; Lebach, et al, 1995; Anderson et al., 1996), including the establishment of upper\nlimits on the amplitude and energy density of gravitational radiation (Anderson et al.,\n1986). Also, the search for gravitational waves, their detection, and studies of mechanisms\nof wave generation, as well as their propagation and interaction with matter. These studies\nwill increase our knowledge of the early age of the universe, its cosmological evolution, and\nthe behavior of stellar systems, as well as further confirming the hypothesis of the existence\nof unseen matter in the universe (Anderson, et al., 1995).\nThe modern approach to conducting these different scientific studies should be based upon\nthe use of a well established common relativistic framework for both collecting and interpreting astronomical observations. Until recently, this task had been done by taking into account\nonly the post-Newtonian corrections to the solar static spherically symmetric (Schwarzschild)\ngravitational field. The basic relativistic effects, such as Mercury\'s perihelion advance, gravitational light deflection, redshift, and time delay (the Shapiro effect), have been calculated with\n\npost-Newtonian accuracy by a number of authors, and the corresponding results are well known\n(Brumberg, 1972; Misner et al, 1973; Will, 1993). It should be noted that during the last 10 years\nthe precision of theoretical predictions of satellite motion has increased considerably. This has\nhappened because some of the leading static-field post-Newtonian perturbations in the dynamics\nof the planets, the Moon and artificial satellites have been included in the equations of motion\n(eq.m.) and time and position transformation (Moyer, 1971; Moyer 1981; Dickey et al., 1989;\nHuang et al, 1990; Dickey et al, 1994; Habib et al, 1994; Williams et al, 1996). However, due\nto enormous progress in the accuracy of astronomical observations at the present time, we must\nnow take into account the much smaller relativistic effects caused by the post-post-Newtonian\ncorrections to the solar gravitational field as well as the post-Newtonian contributions from the\nlunar and planets\' gravities. Moreover, it is also well understood that the effects due to the nonstationary behavior of the solar system gravitational field as well as its deviation from spherical\nsymmetry should also be considered (Kopejkin, 1988). The successful solution of these problems\nrequires a detailed critical review of modern observational methods and the development of a\nconsistent and physically well-founded theory of relativistic celestial mechanics and relativistic\nRFs. This theory should provide one with reliable physical grounds for theoretical studies of the\nnew relativistic gravitational phenomena as well as meet the needs of practical astronomy.\nIt has long been considered that such a theory already exists in the form of the parameterized\npost-Newtonian formalism (PPN) (Nordevedt, 1968a,b; Will, 1971; Will & Nordtvedt, 1972; Will,\n1993). However, based on the present understanding of the problem, this point of view is not\ncorrect. Indeed, the foundation of the PPN formalism is based upon the existence of an exclusive\nset of inertial RFs. Usually, the origin of such a frame either coincides with the solar system\nbarycenter or it may be transformed to one by the post-Galilean coordinate transformations\n(Chandrasekhar & Contopulos, 1967; Kopejkin, 1988; Will, 1993). The resultant barycentric\ninertial RF is perfectly suited for analyzing both light ray propagation in the proximity of the\nSun and the motion of the planets around the Sun. However, it does not address some very\npractical needs of modern astronomy, such as providing a description of a satellite\'s motion\naround the Earth (or other planet), studying properties of the Earth\'s rotation, or collecting\nand interpreting data from satellite laser ranging (SLR), lunar laser ranging (LLR), or groundor space-based VLBI. These difficulties are caused by the fact that the planet\'s center of mass,\nin general, does not move along the geodesic line. The corresponding deviations are very small\n(Misner et al, 1973; Brumberg, 1972; Will, 1993) and a product of the coupling of the planet\'s\ninternal multipole moments to the external gravitational field. It is well-known that geodesic\nmotion in the general theory of relativity, for example, can be is viewed as free fall. Moreover,\nin the immediate vicinity of the free-falling body, one may introduce a local quasi-inertial RF.\nIn this RF, an external gravitational field should manifest itself in the form of tidal forces only\n(Synge, 1960; Bertotti & Grishchuk, 1990). However, the PPN coordinate system, with its origin\nat the center of mass of the planet, does not satisfy this last condition, and therefore it may\nnot be treated as a quasi-inertial RF (Kopejkin, 1988). However, from the practical point of\nview of collecting and interpreting experimental data, one needs to use a set of RFs with welldefined geometrical and physical properties. Thus, it has been shown that a poor choice of\ncoordinate transformations for defining the proper RF may lead to unnecessary complications\nin the equations of motion. These equations may appear to contain non-physical (or fictitious)\nforces acting on the bodies in the system. Although these forces are simply a result of a \'bad\'\nchoice of RF, their appearance in the equations of motion may make the scientific interpretation of\nthe collected results much more difficult. For example, the term with an amplitude of about one\nmeter in the relativistic theory of motion of the moon (Brumberg, 1958; Baierlein, 1967) has no\n\nreal physical meaning when built on the basis of the proper coordinates. The appearance of this\nterm is an artifact of the choice of coordinates and, therefore, the one-meter term is not observable\n(Soffel et al, 1986; Kopejkin, 1988). This example suggests that a clear understanding of the\ndynamic properties of a chosen RF will help make the separation between physically measurable\nquantities and coordinate-induced ones and, hence, will simplify the analysis of the data obtained.\nFrom this standpoint, the detailed construction of a relativistic theory of astronomical RFs\nis greatly needed. It is especially important because at present almost all the astronomical\nobservations (such as optical, radio, Doppler, laser, etc.) are performed and/or processed by\nexperimental equipment placed on the Earth\'s surface. Moreover, there is great demand for\nreliable relativistic navigation in outer space for near-future space missions, such as space-based\ngravitational-wave astronomy. Let us also note that there are near-term plans for launching\nseveral drag-free satellites with GPS receivers onboard: Gravity Probe B (GP-B) (Bardas et al.,\n1989), LAGEOS III, a satellite test of the equivalence principle (STEP), and the Mercury Orbiter\nmission, which has been proposed by the European Space Agency as a cornerstone mission under\nthe Horizon 2000 Plus program (Anderson, Turyshev et al., 1996). There exist plans to include\nthe post-post-Newtonian contributions to the light propagation effects coming from the solar\ngravitational field and the post-Newtonian gravitational perturbations by the planets of the\nsolar system (Klioner & Kopejkin, 1992). In particular, one of the most promising projects is the\ndeployment into Earth orbit of a precision optical interferometer (POINTS). This satellite will be\ndesigned to be able to measure the arcs between the pairs of stars separated on the sky by the\nright angle with an anticipated accuracy on the order of a few microarcseconds (/zas) (Chandler\n& Reasenberg, 1990). These plans encourage the development of orbit determination algorithms\nthat would enable one to process the data with the required relativistic accuracy. This alone\nwill require substantial work to be done in development of a number of theoretical and practical\nquestions, such as\n(i). The construction of a dynamic inertial RF and a more precise definition of the orbital\nelements of the Sun, Earth, moon, planets, and their satellites (Standish et al.; 1992,\nChandler et al, 1994; Dickey et al, 1994; Williams et al, 1996; Standish, 1995).\n(ii). The construction of a kinematic inertial RF, based on the observations of stars and quasars\nfrom spaceborne astronomical observatories (Fukushima, 1991a; Standish et al, 1992).\n(iii). The construction of a precise ephemeris for the motion of bodies in the solar system to support reliable navigation in the solar system (Denisov et al, 1989; Standish et al, 1995; Standish, 1995). The construction of precise radio-star catalogs for spacecraft astro-orientation\nand navigation in outer space beyond the solar system.\n(iv). The comparison of dynamic and kinematic inertial RFs, based on the observations of spacecraft on the background of quasars, pulsars, and radio stars, as well as the verification of\nthe zero points of the coordinates in the inertial RF (Jacobs et al, 1993; Folkner et al,\n1994; Fukushima, 1995).\nTherefore, the motivation for this research is quite natural: In order to propose the necessary recommendations for corrections to existing software codes, we will re-examine the basic\nconcepts of high-precision navigation in the solar system. The principal goal of this report is to\nprovide one with a solid theoretical foundation for the relativistic astronomical measurements\nin the curved space-time. To reach this goal we, by using the methods of the WFSMA, will develop\n\na new approach to the relativistic treatment of the satellite orbit determination problem. This\napproach will be based upon a new theory of coordinate transformations (i.e., the theory of\nrelativistic RFs) and measurement models in relativistic celestial mechanics. The outline of the\npresent report is as follows:\nThe next subsection contains a brief historical introduction to the problem of motion of\nN weakly interacting self-gravitating extended bodies. To specify our theoretical studies, we\nwill present a qualitative description of the astronomical N-body systems of interest. In order\nto provide a solid motivation for this research, we will analyze the different methods used to\napproach this problem and will present their advantages and the encountered difficulties.\nIn Section 2, we discuss the conventional PPN barycentric approach, which is based on the\nsolution to the gravitational one-body problem. Recognizing that the generalization of the obtained results into a general case of motion of an arbitrary N-body system is not straightforward,\nwe analyze the conditions necessary to derive the restricted solution for the motion of the general\nN-body problem. We also discuss ways to obtain the complete multipolar solution to the problem\nin the general case.\nSection 3 is devoted to a general description of the new method proposed to overcome the\nabove mentioned problems. We discuss a new iterative approach to describing the dynamics of\nan isolated astronomical N-extended-body system in the metric theories of gravity. The N-body\nsolution of the gravitational field equations in the proper RF^ originated in an arbitrary body\n(A) is formally presented as a sum of the four following terms: (i) 7j$, which is the Riemann-flat\ninertial space-time: #4nst(7w) = ^ (n) hmn , which is the gravitational field generated by the\nbody (A) itself; (iii) tihm , the perturbations caused by other bodies in the system (B ^ A);\nand, finally, (iv) the gravitational interaction term h\xe2\x84\xa2f n . This method is presented in its most\ngeneral form and, hence, it is valid for a number of metric theories of gravity. We discuss the\ngeneral properties of the post-Newtonian non-rotating coordinate transformations and present\nthe straight, inverse, and mutual coordinate transformations. As a possible way of generalizing\nthe results obtained, we discuss the use of the rotational coordinate transformations. In addition,\nwe discuss the necessary conditions for constructing a proper RF with well-defined dynamical\nproperties. Physically, these conditions should provide one with an additional inertial force acting\non the body in its proper RF such that the body will be in a state of equilibrium. Mathematically,\nthese conditions required that the total dipole moment of the system of the fields produced by\nmatter, the field of inertia, and the gravitational field taken jointly will vanish for all times.\nIn Section 4, we apply the proposed formalism to the case of general relativity. The celestial\nbodies are assumed to consist of a perfect fluid and possess any number of the internal mass and\ncurrent multiple moments that characterize the internal structure of such bodies. We present\nthe physical and mathematical definitions of the proper RF in the WFSMA. We find the explicit\nsolution for the interaction term. This enables us to construct all the necessary expressions\nfor the metric tensor in both the barycentric inertial and the arbitrarily parameterized proper\nquasi-inertial RFs.\nIn Section 5, we present the general solution for the global and local problems, as well as\nshow the general solution for the functions of the coordinate transformation in the case of bodies with a weak external gravitational field. In particular, within the present accuracy of radio\n\nmeasurements, we discuss the generalized Fermi-normal-like proper RF, which is defined in the\nimmediate vicinity of such extended bodies.\nIn Section 6, we generalized the results obtained on the case of a system of N arbitrarily\nshaped and deformable extended bodies. To do this, we study the existence of the conservation\nlaws in the proper RF. It turns out that the existence of these laws in the WFSMA may be\nshown explicitly in the case of well separated celestial bodies. This allows us to evaluate the\nsurface integrals on the boundaries of the domains occupied by the celestial bodies and present\nthe explicit coordinate transformations between the different RFs in the WFSMA of the general\nrelativity. These results are the extension of the post-Galilean transformations obtained by\nChandrasekhar and Contopulos (1967) on the case of a system of interacting celestial extended\nbodies. We discuss the properties of the corresponding quasi-group of motion and its application\nto the study of the dynamics of an arbitrary N-body gravitational problem.\nSection 7 is devoted to future relativity missions in the solar system. In order to provide\nthe framework to study relativistic gravity for a number of gravitational theories, our previousderivations will be generalized on the case of the tensor-scalar theories. As a result, we include\nin the analysis the two Eddington parameters (7, /3), which allows us to develop a parameterized\ntheory of astronomical RFs. By analyzing the equations of motion in the two-parameter Ferminormal-like RF, we have obtained an interesting result: that although some terms in the planetocentric eq.m. of the spacecraft around the planet are zero for the case of general relativity, they\nmay produce an observable effect in scalar-tensor theories. This allows us to propose a new null\ntest of the SEP. Also in this section, we discuss the other relativistic gravitational experiments\npossible with the future Mercury Orbiter mission, which has been proposed by the European\nSpace Agency as a cornerstone mission under the Horizon 2000 Plus program. The motivation\nfor this research is to determine what scientific information may be obtained during this mission,\nhow accurate these measurements can be, and what will be the significance of the knowledge\nobtained. We present there both quantitative and qualitative analyses of measurable effects such\nas Mercury\'s perihelion advance, the redshift experiment, and the precession phenomena of the\nHermean orbital plane.\nIn Section 8, we present the hierarchy of the celestial RFs, including the four frames that are\nwidely in use for the practical needs of modern relativistic astronomy. Thus, in a compact and\nexplicit form, we show the coordinate transformations between the barycentric and the geocentric\nRFs, between the geocentric and the satellite RFs, and between the geocentric and the topocentric\nRFs. This presentation contains the two Eddington parameters, (7, /3), which makes the obtained\nresults valid for a wide class of metric theories of gravity. In the discussion, we present a number\nof possible areas for immediate practical application of the theory of astronomical RFs developed\nin this report. We present our conclusions and recommendations for future research on relativistic\ngravity in the solar system and beyond.\nIn order to avoid cumbersome calculations and to simplify the presentation of the main results in the text, some expressions and intermediate relations will be presented in appendices.\nIn Appendix A, we present the generalized gravitational potentials. Appendix B is devoted to a\ndiscussion of the structure of the post-Newtonian power expansion of general geometrical quantities such as the metric tensor, gmn; the Christoffel symbols; and the Riemann tensor, Rmnki,\nin coordinates of an arbitrary RF with respect to small parameters. Appendix C contains the\ngeSeral theory of relativistic coordinate transformations. We discuss there the transformation\nof the base vectors for different coordinate transitions. In Appendix D, we present the features\n\nof the transformations of different equations and quantities, such as the covariant gauge conditions, the Ricci tensor, the gravitational field solutions, and the energy-momentum tensor.\nThe transformation rules for the generalized gravitational potentials under the post-Newtonian\ncoordinate transformation are presented in Appendix E. The Christoffel symbols in the proper\nRF are calculated in Appendix F. The calculation of the form of the inertial part of the metric\ntensor in the proper RF and the form of the interaction term, as well as the components of the\nRiemann tensor in this frame, are presented in Appendix G. In Appendix H, we present some\nuseful identities that are used in Section 6 to study the existence of the conservation laws in an\narbitrary proper RF. And, finally, in Appendix I, we have presented the astrophysical parameters\nused for estimations of the magnitudes of the gravitational effects in Section 7.\n\n1.2\n\nThe Problem of Relativistic Astronomical Measurements.\n\nClassical Newtonian mechanics is based upon the principles of Euclidean geometry. The physical\nexperiments, within the accuracy available at that time, had confirmed the two basic postulates\nof this geometry: that time is absolute and homogeneous and that space is also absolute and,\nnot only homogeneous, but also isentropic. These properties of time and space were discovered\nbecause, for the then-known physical forces,1 the corresponding eq.m. of Newton\'s mechanics\npreserved their form under the Galilean group of motion. These properties may be written for\ntwo different RFs moving relative to each other with constant speed v as\nt\' = t + a,\n\nf\' = f - b - v t ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere parameters a and b are the constant time shift and the displacement of the origin of\nthe coordinate system, respectively. This form-invariancy suggested that, independent of the\nstate of motion of these RFs (they may be either at rest or uniformly moving along a straight\nline relative to each other), all the mechanical phenomena will behave exactly the same way in\nany such RF. This principle has become known as the principle of relativity (Poincare, 1904).\nNote that transformations (1.1) are given in Cartesian coordinates. One may choose another\ncoordinate system (CS) in the same RF without changing its state of motion (say x) by simply\nrotating the coordinate axes: ra = THZxP, where 72.2 is a constant orthogonal rotation matrix.\nThus, Newton\'s mechanics had introduced into physics notions both of an absolute distance\nbetween two points in three-dimensional space and of absolute time. In other words, he asserted\nthat time and coordinates are directly measurable quantities. Because of this, the theory of\ngravitational measurements in celestial mechanics long was based upon the three laws of Newton\'s\nmechanics and coordinate transformations, (1.1). From the practical point of view, there were\ntwo astronomical RFs of primary importance: the barycentric frame (BRF), which is related\nto the barycenter of the solar system, and the geocentric frame (GRF), whose origin coincides\nwith the Earth\'s center of mass. Because of the recent progress in the relativistic treatment of\nan isolated N-body system, there is now clear and unambiguous agreement on an asymptotical\nBRF (which is valid even through the post-Newtonian level of the WFSMA). By assuming that\nthe solar system as a whole is completely isolated, one may put its barycentric RF to be nonaccelerated (or to say \'at rest\') and absolutely non-rotating. The latter condition implies (i) the\nabsence of the centripetal and Coriolis forces (dynamical inertiality) and (ii) that the coordinate\ndirections to the remote light sources (such as quasars) must be constant (kinematic inertiality).\nIn addition, the absence of any external sources of gravity enables one to consider only the proper\n1\n\nThere were only two known natural forces at this time: gravity and elasticity. The first one was described by\nNewton\'s gravitational law and the second by Hooke\'s law.\n\n(or \'inertial\') gravitational field of the solar system. As a result, such an RF was used for a long\ntime as the basic tool for solving almost all the problems in practical astronomy (even relativistic\nones).\nAs far as the GRF is concerned, the situation turns out to be more complicated. If one\nattempts to describe the local gravitational environment of some extended body from an N-body\nsystem (for example, the Earth in the solar system), first of all, based on the results of a study of\nthe existence of the energy-momentum conservation laws, one generally defines the barycentric\ninertial RF: (t\',r\'). Then, one may introduce a non-rotational accelerated GRF (t, f), which is\ndefined at the center of mass of the extended body under study by a coordinate transformation\nsimilar to that of (1.1):\nwhere fb(i) is the Newtonian barycentric radius vector of the body.\nTo analyze the gravitational environment of the body under consideration, one presents the\neffective potential in the body\'s vicinity in the form\n\nwhere UQ is the body\'s own gravitational potential. The influence of the external bodies in the\nchosen frame manifests itself in the form of gravitational tidal forces only. The corresponding\ntidal gravitational potential, t/tld, may be given by\nU tid (r) = U***^ + f) - U ext (f 0 ) - (f- Wext(r0)) .\n\n(1.3&)\n\nThis potential is searched for as the solution of the usual Poisson equation in the form\nAC7tid = -47rpSxt\n\n(1.4a)\n\nwith the boundary conditions\nW tid (f 0 ) = 0,\n\n[7 tid (f 0 )=0,\n\n(1.46)\n\nwhere PQ* is the mass density of the external gravity in the vicinity of the body under study.\nAs a result, the theory of astronomical observations becomes inseparable from the problem of\ndetermining the motion of celestial bodies, because the Newtonian eq.m. for the body\'s center\nof mass is determined as follows:\nt\n(r 0 ).\n(1.5)\nOne may also verify that, in the proper RF for an extended body constructed this way,\nthe body\'s own center of mass will be at rest during the time of the experiment. Indeed, by\nintegrating the local eq.m. of the Newtonian hydrodynamics (Fock, 1955),\nfll)\n\n>\n\n___\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb\n\nPo17 = -poVC/ + Vp,\nat\n\n(1.6)\n\nover the body\'s compact volume, one obtains the desired result: rh^ = 0, where m^ is the body\'s\nfirst (dipole) mass moment. In the body\'s vicinity, the external gravity produces negligibly small\ntidal perturbations of the local motion, which are presently well known (Standish et al., 1992).\nThis leads to so-called \'quasi-inertial\' properties of GRF. The kinematic advantage of these local\n8\n\ncoordinates, (t, f), is that the RF, when obtained this way, moves with the considered body.\nTheir dynamic usefulness comes from the fact that coordinate transformations (1.2) allow one\n(to some extent) to decouple the motion of the studied body from the global dynamics of the\nsystem as a whole (Pars, 1965; Brumberg, 1972; Damour, Soffel &; Xu (here and after, DSX),\n1991). These are the reasons why this proper RF (or GRF) has become very useful for studying\nlocal physics in a body\'s vicinity.\nThe situation changed drastically when, by generalizing Faraday\'s thoughts on electric and\nmagnetic phenomena, Maxwell discovered a set of equations describing electromagnetic fields.\nThese equations successfully described the two then-\'new\' forces corresponding to electromagnetic and optical phenomena. However, it turned out that the famous Maxwell-Lorentz equations of electromagnetism were not form-invariant under the Galilean transformations, (1.1).\nThis was an indicator that either the laws of Newtonian mechanics were incomplete or these\ntransformations were wrong. From the other side, recall that transformations (1.1) were a simple consequence of the laws of Newton\'s mechanics. It became clear that even if some other\nset of equations were substituted for these laws, transformations (1.1) may not provide a forminvariancy for this new set. Thus, it became obvious that the principle of relativity must have\na more fundamental character. In the Poincare interpretation this principle was reformulated so\nthat the physical laws should be the same for two particular observers, one being at rest and\nthe other one being in the state of steady straight-line motion so that there is no means to find\nout whether or not the second observer is moving. The significance of this principle was that\nit stated that there are no such things as absolute space or time and, moreover, it implied the\nimpossibility of an absolute motion in the general law of nature.\nAs we know now, the understanding of this theory sparked a revolutionary change in the\ncourse of theoretical physics in the beginning of the 20th century. The answer to this problem\nwas given in a series of works by Poincare (1904) and Minkowski (1908) (see also Lorentz et\nal., 1923): that space and time must be united together to form a four-dimensional pseudoEuclidean geometry. The coordinates of two points in this four-dimensional manifold are denoted\nas (ct, r) \xe2\x80\x94> xn = (x\xc2\xb0,x a ), where n = 0,1,2,3 and c is the speed of light. The square of\nthe geodesic distance ds2 between the two infinitely close points of this space-time (interval)\nis given by the four-dimensional analog of the Pythagorean theorem: ds2 = \xe2\x80\xa2ymn(x}dxmdxn.\nThe function 7mn(z) is the metric tensor, which has become the main object for defining the\nstructure of studied space-time (Eisenhart, 1926). These metric coefficients only (as referred to\na particular coordinate system), together with the coordinate differentials, will provide one with\nphysically measurable quantities. In Cartesian coordinates of the Galilean (inertia!) RF, for all\nthe points of the pseudo-Euclidean space-time, this metric function may be chosen in the form of\nthe Minkowski metric: 7mn = diag(l, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x941). As a result of such a change, the coordinates\nlost their absolute meaning and could not be used for direct physical observations. Even the\ndifferentials do not have a physical sense, because they are not directly connected with either\nthe distance between two points in three-dimensional space or with the temporal evolution of\nthe physical processes.\nBy analyzing the Maxwell-Lorentz equations of the electromagnetic field and the interval\nin the form ds2 = jmndxmdxn, Poincare was the first to point out that the set of these field\n\nequations and the quantity ds2 are form-invariant under Lorentz\' transformations, which form\nthe Poincare group of motion:\n\nf \' = f + (7 - 1)-\n\n- 7^,\n\n(1.76)\n\nwhere v is the constant relative speed between the two RFs. Thus, the study of electromagnetic\nphenomena led to the discovery of a new theory of the structure of space-time.\nThe form-invariancy of the metric tensor under transformations (1.7) has suggested a more\ngeneral physical property, namely: for all the possible coordinate transformations between the\ntwo arbitrary RFs, which preserve the form of the metric tensor 7mn, the physical phenomena in\nboth obtained frames will behave in exactly the same way. As a result, the principle of relativity\nbecomes simply a consequence of the latter property. The next logical step was to generalize.\nthe equations of Newton\'s mechanics based on this new four-dimensional relativistic treatment.\nThe resultant set of equations of motion has become known as the relativistic mechanics of\nPoincare (Sard, 1970). This theory was formulated in a covariant form which allows one to study\nthe physical processes in any physical HP. Note that, independently of Minkowski and Poincare,\nEinstein had also formulated a new theory of space-time \xe2\x80\x94 the special theory of relativity (Lorentz\net a/., 1923; Landau &; Lifshitz, 1988). However, this theory was formulated based only on the\nPoincare group of motion and was constrained to the class of inertia! RFs only.\nThe discovery of the pseudo- Euclidean geometry had finally undermined any absolute meaning\nof finite time or finite distance and had substituted instead a purely relative one. Now the interval\nds2 \xe2\x80\x94 the square of the infinitesimal distance in four-dimensional manifold \xe2\x80\x94had become the only\nabsolute quantity. For example, based on the Lorentz transformations, the time in two different\nRFs was no longer the same, but rather depended on the relative speed between the frames:\n\nt0\n\nMoreover, the length of an object in two RFs was also no longer invariant. Thus, a rod, which\nhas a length dlo in a rest frame, will experience the length contraction in an inertially moving\nframe in the direction n \xe2\x80\x94 v/v, parallel to the speed of motion v:\n(1.86)\n\nIt should be stressed that formulas (1.8) are simply the consequence of the properties of pseudoEuclidean geometry. It should be noted that, together with the properties of this geometry,\nthe language of the \'microscopic\' (or field) description has appeared in theoretical physics as the\nnecessary tool for theoretical studies of physical processes. This \'field\' terminology deals with the\ndensities of physical quantities in a relativistic coordinate-independent way, rather than providing\na coordinate-dependent (or RF-dependent) regular \'macroscopic\' treatment, and it has become\na very powerful substitution for the latter. As a result, for the special relativistic treatment of\ngravitational observations, contrary to Newtonian mechanics, one should always appeal to the\nnotion of the \'proper\' quasi-inertial RF of a body in order to correctly define the body\'s mass,\nits barycenter, and the intrinsic multipole moments.\n10\n\nFor a long time, it was thought that the special theory of relativity, and hence the relativistic\nmechanics of Poincare, were theories that described the physical processes solely in different\ninertial RFs (which may be linked to each other by the Lorentzian transformations, (1.7)). From\nthe other side, real astronomical phenomena unavoidably involve descriptions based on noninertial RFs, which, by a misunderstanding (partially based on the Equivalence Principle), were\nconsidered as a prerogative of the general theory of relativity only. However, this is not true.\nBased on the discovery of the pseudo-Euclidean space- time made by Poincare and Minkowski, one\nmay use an infinite class of admissible RFs, both inertial and non-inertial, in order to describe the\nphysical phenomena in the real world. Indeed, the Riemann curvature tensor, which defines the\nintrinsic geometry of space-time, is zero in any of these frames. However, observing any physical\nprocess enables one to confidently distinguish the situations when an experiment is performed\nin an inertial or in a non-inertial frame. This means that the following generalized principle\nof relativity (Logunov, 1987) is valid: Independent of the state of motion of the RF chosen for\nthe experiment (either inertial or non-inertial), one may define an infinite set of other RFs for\nwhich the physical phenomena will behave in exactly the same way. Moreover, one may not\nestablish, by any means, in which RF from this equivalent set the experiment is performed. As a\nresult, by defining the admissible coordinate transformations that leave the metric tensor in the\nchosen RF form-invariant, one defines the entire infinite set of physically equivalent RFs. Thus,\nfrom Poincare \'s equations of relativistic mechanics and the requirement of the form-invariancy of\nthe metric tensor, one may find another fundamental group of motion in the pseudo-Euclidean\nspace-time, namely, the relativistic group of uniformly accelerated motion of a monopole particle.\nIndeed, for a particle with mass mo moving under the influence of a constant force / = (/, 0,0),\nthe law of motion is given by\n\n(1.9)\nwhere a = f/mo is the corresponding constant acceleration. The interval of the two-dimensional\nspace-time in the co-moving RF takes the form\n2at dtdx\n\n2\n\n-dx.\n\n(1.10)\n\n+\n\nFrom this it is easy to show that the corresponding two-parametric group of motion for the\nuniformly accelerated RFs may be presented as follows:\n\nvx\na\n\nc \xe2\x80\x94v\n\nT/\n\n*0+ \xe2\x80\x94 + 2\n\nc\n\na\n\nwhere IQ and XQ are the group constants.\nOne can see that, in order to preserve the form-invariancy of the metric tensor for the time\ntranslation (given by a parameter to) contrary to the Poincare group, (1.7), this nonlinear group\nof motion requires the transformation of spatial coordinates as well. Thus, the non-inertiality of\n11\n\nthe RF makes the physical analysis more difficult than in the case of inertial RFs. The situation\nbecomes even more complicated if one decides to describe the motion of an extended object. This\nis because the bodies in this case, besides the \'usual\' Lorentzian relativistic contractions, will\nexperience other dynamic effects generated by the properties of the RF chosen for the analysis.\nIn practice, one is usually faced with the problem of extracting the RF-induced effects. As the\nproperties of the pseudo-Euclidean space-time are well established, this problem may be solved\nin a satisfactory manner by constructing a quasi-inertial RF in the vicinity of the body under\nconsideration. The vanishing of a Riemann curvature leads to a maximum possible number of the\nKilling vectors in this geometry (N=10), which enables us to separate physically observable and\ncoordinate-induced quantities in a satisfactory manner. Note that the corresponding theoretical\nmethods of the classical mechanics of Poincare are presently well tested in different experimental\nsituations, and they are used extensively in many areas of modern relativistic physics, such as. high-energy physics, theoretical astrophysics, and solid-state physics. Astronomers, however,,\npreviously had not fully accepted these methods into real astronomical practice, as there was\nlittle observational data with relativistic accuracy.\nThis situation has changed dramatically during the last two decades, and now that the accuracy of astronomical observations enables us to perform studies of the physical processes in\nthe universe with much higher precision, the problem of relativistic gravitational measurements\nhas become very important. This has led to numerous experiments testing different hypotheses\nthat have laid the foundations for a number of recent theories of gravity (Will, 1993). Gravity, however, remains the last yet unexplored frontier of modern theoretical physics (Hawking\n& Israel, 1987; Damour & Schafer, 1991; Damour & Taylor, 1992). This is mainly because\nthe weakness of the gravitational interaction in the solar system presents great difficulties when\nplanning and performing gravitational experiments. The other reason is that the discovery of\nthe field equations of the general theory of relativity has changed our physical conceptions once\nagain. According to this theory, not only are space and time united together by forming a\nfour-dimensional Riemann manifold with the general metric tensor gmn, but also it is matter\nthat is responsible for generating the properties of this space-time. In other words, space-time\ntells matter how to move and matter tells space-time how to curve (Misner et al., 1973). There\nare many other gravitational theories currently under consideration, but the metric theories of\ngravity have taken a special position among all the possible theoretical models. The reason is\nthat, independent of the many different principles at their foundations, the gravitational field\nin these theories affects matter directly through the metric tensor of Riemann space-time gmn,\nwhich is determined from the field equations of a particular theory of gravity. In contrast to\nNewtonian gravity, this tensor contains the properties of a particular gravitational theory and\nalso carries the information about the gravitational field of the bodies themselves. This property\nof the metric tensor enables one to analyze the motion of matter in one or another metric theory\nof gravity based only upon the underlying principles of modern theoretical physics.\nThe situation with relativistic measurements has become even more complicated. Because\nit is well known that in the Riemann space-time one cannot have an explicit mathematical\ndefinition for the proper RF, it is permissible to introduce any coordinate system. As a rule,\nbefore solving these equations, four restrictions (coordinate or gauge conditions) must be imposed\non the components of the gmn- These conditions extract a particular subset from an infinite set\nof space-time coordinates. Inside this subset, the coordinates are linked by smooth differentiate\ntransformations that do not change the coordinate conditions being chosen. In general relativity,\nfor example, there exists no absolute time or Euclidean space. Besides, one may not, in the\n\n12\n\ngeneral case, introduce some \'privileged\' RF in space-time. Contrary to the Newtonian theory\nof gravity, coordinates in curved space-time have no physical meaning and cannot be measured\ndirectly by astronomical observations.\nNevertheless, there are some special cases in which one may speak about privileged coordinates in general relativity. One such case is space-time having a weak gravitational field and\nslowly moving matter. The density of the total non-linear Riemann metric tensor gmn of such\nspace-time may be linearized and presented as a sum of the density of the pseudo-Euclidean background metric 7mn plus the small perturbations caused by the physical gravitational field hmn:\n^J^ggmn = 1/:::77mn + hmn. Then, in the Galilean inertia! RF, such a space-time may be covered\nby coordinates that differ only slightly from the absolute time and Cartesian space coordinates\nof the Newtonian theory of gravity. We shall call these space-time coordinates quasi-Cartesian.\nThese quasi-Cartesian coordinates are the most convenient coordinate system for developing a\nrelativistic theory of astronomical RFs inside the solar system. They are also used in the case of\nan isolated astronomical system that consists of N well-separated and extended bodies possessing\na weak gravitational field and moving with slow orbital and rotational velocities (such as our\nsolar system).\nThe solution of the field equations of general relativity in the WFSMA for an isolated distribution of matter is presently well known (Will, 1993). There have been a number of attempts\nto describe the motion of different gravitationally bounded astronomical systems. This problem of describing the motion of a system consisting of N massive monopole particles was first\nconsidered by Einstein et al. (1938); the rigid uniform rotation of the bodies was included by\nPapapetrou (1948, 1951), Fock (1955), etc. It was shown that the post-Newtonian equations of\nEinstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann (EIH) governing the motions of N mass points allow the same ten\nclassical integrals as the equations of Newtonian gravity, namely, those expressing conservation\nof energy, linear momentum, and the uniform motion of the center mass of the body. Moreover,\nChandrasekhar & Contopulos (1967) had shown there exists a way to introduce the notion of the\n\'center of mass\' of such a system, which enables one to construct the barycentric inertial RFoThus, by studying the problem of the form-invariancy of the metric tensor and the corresponding\npost-Newtonian EIH eq.m., they had shown that both of these expressions are invariant under\nthe following \'post-Galilean\' coordinate transformations that establish a correspondence between\nframes with uniform relative motion:\n\nB\n\n(1.126)\nwhere va is the constant velocity of the uniform motion, ms is the post-Newtonian rest mass of\nthe distribution of matter under study, and a is some arbitrary constant. One can see that both of\nthe equations in (1.12) contain additional terms beyond those obtained by expanding the Lorentz\ntransformation, (1.7). The last term in eq. (1.12a) is the contribution that is unique to general\nrelativity, and it is this term that gives transformation (1.12) its non-Lorentzian character. The\nother additional term in eq. (1.12b) represents an arbitrary infinitesimal rotation that may be\nsatisfactorily explained in terms of the Poincare group. As a result, the obtained post-Galilean\ntransformations are generalizations of the Lorentzian transformations, (1.7), in the gravitational\ncase.\n\n13\n\nThese post-Galilean transformations, (1.12), are of little use for astronomical observations\nas they were obtained in order to demonstrate the existence of the barycentric inertial RFo\nand they are not suited for the construction of an astronomical RF for even massive monopole\nbodies. This is simply because such proper RFs generally will not be inertial, but rather quasiinertial. Moreover, expressions (1.12) do not account for the multipolar structure of the extended\nbodies. However, we need some transformation that will work, since, in order to present all the\nnecessary expressions for the metric tensor and the equations of motion with the same postNewtonian accuracy, one must have a physically grounded definition of the transformation rules\nbetween the RFs. To find this transformation, one must expand the Newtonian contributions in\nterms of the intrinsic mass and current multipole moments of the bodies (Damour, 1983, 1986).\nThe greater the required accuracy, the larger the number of these terms that must be taken\ninto account. It is known that the fully relativistic definition of these moments may be given\nin the proper quasi-inertial RF only. Such a definition replaces that which was given in the rest\nframe of the one-body problem.2 In presenting these transformations, one should also take into\naccount that, due to the non-linear character of the gravitational interaction, these moments\nare expected to interact with external gravity, changing the state of motion of the body itself.\nFock (1955) was the first to notice that in order to find the solution of the global problem (the\nmotion of the N-body system as a whole), the solution for the local gravitational problem (in the\nbody\'s vicinity) is required. In addition, one must establish their correspondence by presenting\nthe coordinate transformation by which the physical characteristics of motion and rotation are\ntransformed from the coordinates of one RF to another. Thus, one must find the solutions to\nthe three following problems (Damour, 1987; DSX, 1991):\n(1). The global problem:\n(i). We must construct the asymptotically inertial RF.\n(ii). We must find the barycentric inertial RFo for the system under study. This is primarily\na problem of describing the global translational motion of the bodies constituting the\nN-extended-body system (i.e., finding the geodesic structure of the space-time occupied by the whole system).\n(2). The local problem:\n(i). We must establish the properties of the gravitational environment in the proximity of\neach body in the system (i.e., finding the geodesic structure of the local region of the\nspace-time in the body\'s gravitational domain).\n(ii). We must construct the local effective rest frame of each body.\n(iii). We must study the internal motion of matter inside the bodies as well as establish\ntheir explicit multipolar structure and rotational motion.\n(3). The theory of the RFs:\n(i). We must find a way to describe the mutual physical cross-interpretation of the results\nobtained for the above two problems (i.e., the fine mapping of the space-time).\n2\n\nNote that, due to the breaking of the symmetry of the total Riemannian space-time by realizing the 3+1\nsplit (Thorne et al., 1988), these moments will not form tensor quantities with respect to general four-dimensional\ncoordinate transformations in the WFSMA. Instead, these quantities will behave as tensors under the sub-group\nof this total group of motion only, namely, the three-dimensional rotation. This is similar to the situation in\nclassical electrodynamics, where electric E and magnetic H fields are not true vectors, but rather components of\nthe 4x4 tensor of the electromagnetic field Fmn = (\xc2\xa3 \xc2\xae H) (Landau & Lifshitz, 1988).\n14\n\nBecause the solutions to the first two problems will not be complete without presenting the rules\nof the coordinate transformations between the global and the local (or planeto-centric) RFs chosen\nfor such an analysis, the theory of astronomical RFs becomes inseparable from the problem of\ndetermining the motion of the celestial bodies. Prom the other side, if one attempts to describe\nthe global dynamics of the system of N arbitrarily shaped extended bodies, one will discover\nthat, even in the WFSMA, this solution will not be possible without appropriate description of\nthe gravitational environment in the immediate vicinity of the bodies.\nConcerning the problem of astronomical data reduction, first of all, one must find the connection between the coordinate quantities and the physically observable ones. Until quite recently,\nrelativistic reduction of astrometric observations was based on the use of the barycentric RF and\ncovariant definitions of observables (Zel\'manov, 1956; Synge, 1960; Misner et al., 1973; Ivanitskaja, 1979; Soffel, 1989; Brumberg, 1991a,b; Nordtvedt, 1995). Thus, interval ds2 in terms of\nobservable coordinates dXn = (cdr, dr a ) is taken to be diagonal, and it is usually presented in\nthe form of pseudo-Euclidean Minkowski space-time in the Galilean RF as follows:\nds2 = gmn(x)dxmdxn = jrnndX\xe2\x84\xa2dX* = c2dr2 - dr2 ,\n\n(1.13)\n\nwhere the physical time dr and the three-dimensional physically measurable distance dr2 are\ngiven by\ndr = v\xc2\xbbi\n\n+ \xc2\xa32f*\xc2\xa3,\n\ndr2 = ( - gap + *\xc2\xabM W\xc2\xabfa/>.\n\n(1.14)\n\n900\n\nIn this method, the directly measurable quantities by definition are the tetrad components (or\nbase vectors) an of the null wave vector of a photon projected onto a space-like hypersurface\nbeing orthogonal to the four- velocity of an observer un: an = P\xe2\x84\xa2k l , where P\xe2\x84\xa2 = 6\xe2\x84\xa2 + u m u n is\nthe projection operator that satisfies the conditions Pg = 2 and P\xe2\x84\xa2P% = P\xe2\x84\xa2. By definition,\nthe physically observable components of the vector an in the locally orthonormalized tetrad\nbasis of an observer has only the spatial components aa, while the temporal one, a\xc2\xb0, is equal\nto zero. Contraction of the components an with the basis vectors A\xc2\xa3, i.e., ap = A\xc2\xa3crn, is a\ncovariant quantity that is independent of the choice of RF. This gives the procedure of relaying\nthe coordinate quantities dxp to the observable ones dX? = (cdr, dra} as follows: dX? =\nFrom equation (1.13), we can find the following relation:\nds2 = TpndXVdX" = XllXPnj-Spdxmdxn = gmndxmdxn,\n\n(1.15)\n\nwhich provides one with the necessary equation for finding the components of the tetrad:\ngmn = A^A^p.\n\n(1-16)\n\nFrom this equation and with the help of relations (1.14), one, in principle, may find all the\nnecessary basis vectors A% (Logunov, 1987; Soffel, 1989). Using this technique as well as the\nspecial methods of the Riemann geometry, one may establish the relationships between the\nbasis vectors and transform the measurable components on = (0, aa} to the coordinates of the\nbarycentric RF. However, the reduction formula obtained this way has been proven to contain\na non-observable coordinate-induced contribution in the relativistic terms (Klioner &: Kopejkin,\n1992). For example, the barycentric velocity of the astrometric spacecraft orbiting the Earth is\nnot directly observable and cannot be derived with the requisite accuracy with this barycentric\nmethod. To solve this and some other problems unavoidably arising in the solely barycentric\napproach, a consistent relativistic theory of astronomical RFs is needed.\n\n15\n\nAs we have mentioned earlier, a well-defined proper RF must be linked with the inertial RFo\nby relativistic coordinate transformations that introduce no spurious terms into the metric or the\nequations of motion of the relativistic local problem. However, the precise definition of the quasiinertial proper RF in a curved space-time (even in the WFSMA) is not quite straightforward.\nWe know that in freely falling inertial frames, the external gravitational field appears only in\nthe form of tidal interactions. Up to these tidal corrections, freely falling bodies behave as if\nexternal gravity were absent (Synge, 1960; Bertotti & Grishchuk 1990). The general theoretical\nconsideration in this case is usually based on the geodesic equation\nn\n\n\'.\n\n(1.17)\n\nThis equation may be interpreted as if on the left side we have the four-acceleration of the\nparticle, while on the right side is the force acting upon the particle. By careful choice of the\ncoordinates, one may make the Christoffel symbols F^ vanish in the immediate vicinity of the\nbody\'s world line, which will put this force equal to zero (Fermi, 1922a,b; Landau & Lifshitz,\'\n1988). This allows one to use the analogy of inertial motion and, as a result, the four- velocity\nmay be parameterized by the natural parameter s along the geodesic: un = ans + \xc2\xa3>n, with an\nand bn being the arbitrary constant parameters. The analysis shows that in the vicinity of the\nworld line of the origin of this well-defined RF^, the coordinate transformation from the inertial\nRFo (xn) = (x 0 ,^) to the physically justified RF^ (y^) = (y^y^) must nave the structure of\na Taylor expansion with respect to the powers of a spatial coordinate y^ (Manasse & Misner,\n1963; Manasse, 1963; Misner et al, 1973):\n\nwhere the function x^0(y^) represents the world line\'s description of the origin of the coordinates\n(y^)> and *ne functions e^ and ^A^Q are coefficients of expansion. This relativistic transformation should replace the post-Galilean transformations (1.12) as well as the special relativistic\ngroup of motion of the uniformly accelerated RFs, (1.7), allowing them both to be generalized\nin the case of a system of N arbitrary extended self-gravitating bodies.\nIt should be noted that the use of the approach described above was based upon the geodesic\nequation (1.17), but, as we know, extended bodies do not move along the geodesic lines. Instead,\nthe interaction of their intrinsic mulipole moments with external gravity causes deviation of their\nmotion from the geodesic. This means that this geodesic method is valid only for the case of\nmonopole structureless test particles. In order to provide the dynamic definition for the proper\nRF, one should obtain the eq.m. of the extended bodies and require that the acceleration of the\nbody will vanish in its proper RF. One way to do this is to generalize the Fock-Chandrasekhar\napproach in derivation of the eq.m. for the extended bodies, which is based upon the equation\nof the conservation of the density of the energy-momentum tensor Tmn in the form VmTmn = 0.\nOne may expect that the correct transformations will modify the structure of expressions (1.18)\ni j/\\\nin the higher-order terms of the spatial coordinates: ~ yA , where (k > 3).\nWe should mention here that in the scientific literature, in addition to the expression \'reference frame,\' the notion of a \'coordinate system\' (CS) has recently come into use (Kopejkin,\n1988; Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a,b; DSX, 1991-1994). This confusion in terminology partially\ncame from a misunderstanding of the basic principles of the theory of relativistic observables\nin the curved space-time developed by ZePmanov (1956). In accord with his chronogeometric\n16\n\nclassification, one should distinguish between these two physically different concepts. Thus, the\nRF is an arbitrary set of four coordinates chosen to define the position of the body under study.\nAs we know, in order to properly describe the motion of the N-body system, one should have\nat least N+l of these RFs (DSX, 1991). The CS is the coordinates one may choose to describe\nthe physical processes in the vicinity of the body in its proper RF. A coordinate system is a\nparticular code for labeling points in an RF by some numbers. However, once the RF has been\nchosen, one may not make the choice of the CS arbitrarily. In order to introduce the CS one\nmust fulfill the chronogeometric requirements, which basically state or say that, while introducing the CS, one shouldn\'t change the state of motion of the RF already chosen for solution. In\nother words, the choice of the CS should provide one with a new RF that should be physically\nequivalent to the old one. In practice, one usually may introduce an infinite class of CSs without\nviolating this equivalency (Zel\'manov, 1956; Logunov, 1987; Denisov &: Turyshev, 1989). From\nthe other side, it is well known that in curved space-time there are no inertial RFs even in the\nWFSMA; instead one may introduce only quasi-inertial ones. Moreover, a non-optimal choice\nof the CS may change the dynamic properties of the RF and may significantly complicate the\neq.m. of the bodies, leading to the wrong conclusions (Kopejkin, 1988). This means that a clear\nphysical definition for the RF is very important. Such a definition should enable one to study the\nform-invariancy of the corresponding metric tensor. As a result, one may reconstruct the group\nof motion, which leaves this metric tensor form-invariant, and which will provide one with the\nclass of admissible physically equivalent coordinate transformations in the RF of interest. We\nwill keep this relativistic terminology, and in our further discussion, we will distinguish between\nthe CS and the RF.\nAs we noted before, the properties of the proper RF should be based primarily upon the\nstructure of the metric tensor and the equations of motion of the local problem. For practical\nreasons, in order to establish the physical characteristics of the proper RF^ constructed for a\nparticular body (A) from the system, it is best to use the well-known properties of the freely\nfalling RFs as a first approximation when examining the interaction between the bodies. Thus,\nthe expected properties of a physically well-defined proper RF^ may be expressed as follows:\n(i). The gravitational field solutions for both relativistic global and local problems should be\nobtained with the same covariant gauge conditions. At least up to the terms describing the\nmotion of the mass monopoles, the metric tensor and the eq.m. of the local problem must\nnot depend on the \'absolute\' velocity of the motion of the origin of the proper RF^ relative\nto the inertial RFo- Both the tensor and the eq.m. in this case may admit the dependence\non the relative velocities of the bodies only (Fock, 1955; Kopejkin, 1988). The body\'s own\ntranslational motion in its proper RF should vanish.\n(ii). This field in the local region must be made up of four physically different contributions,\nnamely, the proper and external gravitational fields, the field of inertia, and the gravitational interaction term. The proper gravitational field outside the body should be describable by the set of mass and current intrinsic multipole moments including the monopole,\nthe dipole, etc. (Thorne & Hartle, 1985; Kopejkin, 1988). The gravitational field of the\nexternal bodies must be presented in .the proper RF^ solely in the form of tidal terms\ngenerated by mass and current multipole moments of these bodies (Fermi, 1922a,b; Synge,\n1960). The field of inertia is due to the specific properties of the coordinate transformations\nchosen for the construction of this RF. The interaction term describes the mutual coupling\nof the three above-named terms.\n\n17\n\n(iii). Coordinate transformations between the different RFs should be homogeneous functions\nomitting the infinite number of non-singular partial derivatives. These functions should\nnot violate the gauge conditions chosen for the problem and must be completely defined\nby means of the local gravitational field at the origin of the coordinates of a particular\nquasi-inertial proper RF.\nFor a long time it was thought that the physically adequate local RF must physically resemble a\nframe that falls freely in the background field created only by external bodies (Kopejkin, 1988).\nHowever, this is not true. This effect is due to the presence of the gravitational interaction\nterm, which reflects the non-linear nature of gravity. When describing the motion of a monopole\nparticle, one may use this analogy and describe the motion of the body as if the external gravity\nwere absent, but, in the general case of the extended self-gravitating body, one must take into\naccount the coupling of the body\'s intrinsic multipoles to the external field. The existence of\nthis coupling should be reflected in the form of the transformation functions. As a result, one.\nshould not think that the \'good\' proper RF may be realized as a locally inertia! RF for a massless\ntest body (Manasse & Misner, 1963; Misner et al., 1973; Ni, 1977; Ni & Zimmerman, 1978).\nPhysically, we are looking for an RF where one may effectively separate the local physics from\nthe external gravitational environment. This is why we would like to apply such an elegant\nand simple Newtonian tidal approach to the post-Newtonian physics of the WFSMA. From the\nmathematical standpoint, we are looking for a solution to the local problem for which the resultant\nspace-time in the proper RF^ will be tangent to the total effective space-time generated by all\nthe bodies in the system, including the body (A). It was shown that the solution with these\nproperties could be found only at the immediate vicinity of the body and that the smaller the\nRiemann curvature of the effective space-time, the further out would be the boundary of validity\nof this solution (Brumberg &; Kopejkin, 1988). Note that the existence of a well-defined proper\nRF has been more or less explicitly assumed by many authors (see, for example, Misner et ai,\n1973; Li & Ni, 1978, 1979a,b; Will, 1993; Nordtvedt, 1995).\n\n1.3 The Qualitative Description of the Astronomical Systems of Interest.\nIn order to provide a quantitative description of the relativistic motion of an astronomical\nN-body system, let us first qualitatively define the small parameters involved in the description\nof such a system. It is known that there are several major methods for studying the dynamics\nof such systems (Damour, 1983, 1986), depending on the relationships between the astrophysical\nparameters characterizing the orbital motion; rotation; gravitational field inside and outside the\nbodies; their sizes, shapes, and internal structures; and the distance between the bodies. We\nshall investigate a structure of space-time for the case of a gravitationally bounded and isolated\ndistribution of matter. We will restrict our attention to only N-body systems, such as our solar\nsystem, which have slowly moving matter and weak gravitational fields both outside and inside\nthe bodies. Let us assume that non-gravitational forces are absent and that the bodies are well\nseparated. Our assumptions then are that the velocities of the orbital motion of the bodies,\nVB, are non-relativistical ones (i.e., considerably smaller than the speed of light c, VB <C c)\nand that any two arbitrary bodies in the system are at distances TBAO tnat are considerably\ngreater than their radii, LA and LB\'- TBAQ > LA,LB- Note that the motion of the bodies at\ndistances TBAO ~ TgA >r9B > where rg is the gravitational radius of the body, has a highly unpredictable character and will require very different mathematical techniques (Shapiro &: Teukolsky,\n1986a,b; Thorne, 1989). Furthermore, let us denote the following quantities for each body in\nthe system: ms is the mass of the body (B); r#0 is the Newtonian barycentric radius vector of\n18\n\nthis body; LB is its mean radius; DB is the minimal distance between the body under question\nand its nearest companion in the system; UB is the internal velocity (rotational vrot and plus\noscillatory vosc) of the element of the body\'s matter in the proper RFs; MB is the frequency of\nits rotation in this RF.B; /jj and SB \' are its internal mass and current moments of the kth\norder, respectively; and, finally, MO and LQ denote the mass and maximal diameter of the entire\nsystem.\nThen, making use of the definitions above, we will concentrate our attention on a solution\nof the problem of motion of such a gravitationally bounded astronomical system of N extended\nbodies in the WFSMA. This approximation may be used successfully if the system of interest\nadmits the existence of the following four groups of small parameters induced by the local and\nglobal of the bodies in the system (denoted with the (I) and (g) subscripts, respectively):\n(1). The shape- and size-induced parameters. We presume that for each body in the system the\nfollowing parameters of a pure geometrical nature may be introduced:\n(i). 8g ~ sup[8^ \xe2\x80\x94 LB/DB] -C 1, which describes the quasi-point structure of each body\nin the system;\n(ii). 81 ~ sup[5f = IB \'/mBl^g] <C 1, which characterizes a dimensionless measure of\nthe deviation of the distribution of the body\'s matter from a spherically symmetric\ndistribution.\n(2). The special relativistic parameters. The orbital and rotational motions of the bodies in the\nsystem generate the following dimensionless parameters:\n(i). eg ~ sup[e^ = VB/C] -C 1, characterizing the speed of the orbital motion of the bodies;\n(ii). e; ~ sup[ef = UB/C] ~ SQ \' /m^I/BC ~ WB.LB/C <C 1, describing the slowness of the\nrotational motion of the bodies.\n(3). The general relativistic parameters. The gravitational field produced by the bodies in the\nsystem may be characterized as follows:\n(i). T)g ~ sup[rjg \xe2\x80\x94 C\'^GTUB/DB} = T 9B /DB <S 1, which describes the weakness of the\ngravitational field outside the bodies;\n(ii). rji ~ sup[r)f = c~2GmB/Ls] = irgB/LB <S 1, which describes the weakness of the\ngravitational field inside the bodies.\n(4). The background-induced parameters. For an isolated system, the absence of initial inhomogeneity of space-time caused by in-fallen radiation, external gravitational sources, or\ncosmological evolution may be characterized by the parameters\n(i). h ~ Hg^T^ ~ 7mn||/(Mo/Lo) "^ *\' w^cn describes the smallness of the maximal deviation of the background metric g^\' from the Minkowskian metric jmn everywhere\nin the system.\n(ii). cr ~ h/<jJB <^ 1, which describes the quasi-stationary behavior of the background\nmetric.\n\n19\n\nWe shall assume that any processes in the system may be considered to be adiabatic (~ 1 yr)\nin comparison to the characteristic time scale of the cosmological evolution of this background\nspace- time (~ 1010 yr) (as described by the Robertson-Walker solution). Moreover, asymptotic\nregions of the isolated N-body system are presumed to be in a state of free fall. This means that\nthe influence of the rest of the matter in the universe on the local dynamics is of the order 10~24,\nwhile the relativistic gravitational perturbations in the system are expected to be in the range of\n10~5 - 10~21 (Will, 1993). With these expected accuracies, the influence of the rest of the matter\nin the universe on the local dynamics of the bodies in the system may safely be neglected. Let us\ndenote this background space-time as 7mn- Although in the general case this background metric\nmay have arbitrary properties, for the case of an isolated system of astronomical bodies and for\nthe WFSMA, one may take this metric in the form of space-time with a constant curvature or\nintroduce flat Minkowski space-time in the vicinity of the system under consideration. These\nassumptions are necessary in order to justify the existence of a barycentric asymptotically inertia!\nRF.\nWith these assumptions and consequences, the dependence on the background-induced parameters h and a in the corresponding eq.m. of the extended bodies may be neglected. The\nequations in this case may be schematically presented as follows (Damour, 1987):\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94^jrB^^^.^^^.^^^\n\n^ 19)\n\nThis expression may be formally expanded with respect to powers of the remaining small parameters, which may be given by\n=\n\n\xc2\xa3\n^mn Pq -^\\^rf g nl\nk,l,m,n,p,q>Q\n\n(1-20)\n\nDepending on the relations between the parameters in any particular problem, there exist several\nbasic approximation methods. Our approach uses an assumption of a weak gravitational field\ninside and outside the bodies as well as an assumption about the slowness of the dynamic\nprocesses in the system. For this case, some of the parameters introduced above are linked\nby equalities or inequalities. Thus, the first relation may be written as 77^ = S^rf, which\nautomatically gives 77^ < 6j* >C 1 or, for the entire system, rig < Sg -C 1. Since we are considering\na gravitationally bounded N-body system in the WFSMA, there should exist relations linked by\nthe virial theorem u^/c2 ~ r gB /DB and v%sc/c2 ~ r 5B /L# (Fock, 1955; Chandrasekhar, 1965),\nsuch that the parameters eg and r)g are equivalent and connected by the following relation:\ne\nq ~ ^g- The parameters ef and rjf are different and vary from body to body in the system.\nOne may also limit the behavior of matter forming the bodies such that \'arbitrary bodies\' must\ne\nhave slowly changing internal mulipole moments: /^ I IB\nf* \' kus, Sg ~ ^flg \xe2\x80\xa2 By\nassuming this, we exclude from this analysis such systems where the bodies are rapidly changing\ntheir multipole structure with time. Fortunately, all the celestial bodies in our solar system\nsatisfy these conditions.\nMoreover, each body studied in this report will be supposed to be isolated, i.e., the immediate\nvicinity of the body is devoid of matter and non-gravitational fields, and the distance, DB (the\nscale of homogeneity of the space-time), is large compared with the body\'s size, LB- For such\nan isolated body, one may split space-time up into three regions as measured in the body\'s\n\'instantaneous\' proper RFs (Misner et al, 1973; Thorne & Hartle, 1985; Kopejkin, 1988): the\nlocal region, which contains a world-tube surrounding the body and extending out to some radius\n\n20\n\nri > LB\', the buffer region, extending from radius ri to some large radius T-Q < DB\', and the\nexternal region, located outside the distance TQ. In the local region, the body\'s own gravitational\nfield dominates, but in the external region, gravitational fields of other bodies become important.\nThe buffer region is placed in the vicinity of the distance r* ~ D^mB/Mo)1/3 from the body,\nwhich is defined from the condition that the body\'s gravitational influence is approximately\nequal to the gravitational influence of the external masses. The buffer region plays the role of\nan asymptotically.flat space-time region for the gravitational field of the body in question. In\nother words, the total three-dimensional volume Vjv, which is occupied by the N-body system\nunder study, may be split into N non-intersecting domains defined around each body in the\nsystem plus the buffer domain do. The situation is similar to that in the problem of the study\nof stellar stability of the solar system (Gladman & Duncan, 1990; Holman &; Wisdom, 1993).\nWithin each domain ds where the gravitational influence of a particular body (B) is dominant\nover external gravity, the orbits of massless test particles will be stable and remain well inside\nthis domain. In the buffer domain, the trajectories of particles are unstable. As a result, the\nset of small parameters defined above, in the case of the local problem, should be supplemented\nby another parameter, namely the parameter of geodesic separation, XB = \\ys\\lDB < 1, where\nLB 5:2/B < T* is the distance from the world line of the body (B) to the current point of interest\ninside the domain ds- This interpretation enables us to evaluate the surface integrals at the\nboundaries of these interacting domains as well as to define the boundary of validity of the\nexpansions with respect to the small parameter A^.\n\n1.4 Different Methods of Constructing the Proper RF.\nThe metric approach in the theories of gravity permits one to choose any RF to describe the\ngravitational environment around the body under question. As we know, a poor choice of the\nnew coordinates may cause unreasonable complications in the physical interpretations of the\ndata obtained (see the related discussion in Kopejkin, 1988; Soffel & Brumberg, 1991). Recently,\nseveral different attempts were made to remove these complications and consequently improve\nthe present solution to the N-body problem in the WFSMA (see, for example, Ashby & Bertotti,\n1984, 1986; Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a,b; Kopejkin, 1988; Klioner, 1993; DSX, 1991-94).\nAlthough these methods represent a significant improvement in our understanding of the general\nproblem, not one of them gives a complete \'recipe\' to overcome the difficulties stated above.\nThe methods differ in their physical and mathematical treatment of the three problems,\nwhich constitute the general problem of motion of a gravitationally bounded astronomical Nbody system (the global and the local problems and the theory of the RFs). One such method\nwas proposed by Bertotti (1954) and has been further developed in a number of publications by\nAshby and Bertotti (1984, 1986), Bertotti (1986), Ashby and Shahid-Saless (1990), Shahid-Saless,\nHellings, and Ashby (1991), and Shahid-Saless (1992). An equivalent method was proposed and\ndeveloped to the extent of practical applications by Fukushima (1988, 1991a,b, 1995a,b). In\nthese works, the \'good\' proper RF is constructed within the first post-Newtonian approximation\n(1PNA) of general relativity for a specific form of the EIH metric (Einstein et al, 1938). The\nEIH metric was obtained in the inertia! RFo and describes the gravitational field only outside\nthe bodies, which may be regarded as massive point particles or spherically symmetric and\nnon-rotating extended bodies (Fock, 1955).\nIn the Bertotti-Fukushima method, the construction of the local RF is based upon finding the\nbackground external metric for the body under consideration. The external metric is obtained\nfrom the complete EIH metric by dropping all of the divergent or undefined terms on the body\'s\n21\n\ncenter of inertia world line. Then, a local Fermi-normal-like frame (Fermi, 1922; Manasse & Misner, 1963; Misner et a/., 1973) is denned in the body\'s vicinity using the background metric with\nrespect to which the body moves along the geodesic. After that, the coordinate transformation\nbetween the Fermi frame and background metric is obtained. The transformation is applied to\nthe complete EIH metric and, thus, the \'good\' proper RF is obtained. The body\'s gravitational\nfield in this proper RF is spherically symmetric (Schwarzchild) and the gravitational field of distant bodies appears only through the curvature tensor of the background metric, i.e., through\nthe tidal effects.\nThe Bertotti-Fukushima method is conceptually simple. It confirms our expectations that the\nphysically adequate proper RF exists and gives an insight into the structure of transformations\n(1.18). However, this method of construction of the Fermi normal coordinates for massive bodies\nhas some drawbacks (Kopejkin, 1988), namely:\n(i). The background external metric was not derived by solving the gravitational field equations. \xe2\x80\xa2.\n(ii). There are physical and mathematical ambiguities in the way of constructing the external\nmetric. These ambiguities are caused by the terms describing the back action of the gravr\nitational field of the body under consideration on the external gravity produced by other\nbodies (Thorne & Hartle, 1985).\n(iii). The method under review cannot be used for derivations of the eq.m. of bodies, i.e., their\nworld lines. A choice of the body\'s center of inertia world line as a geodesic is justified only\na posteriori and with the help of quite a different technique (EIH, 1938; Papapetrou, 1948,\n1951; Brumberg, 1972; Damour, 1983; Thorne & Hartle, 1985; Kopejkin, 1985, 1987).\n(iv). The method has been elaborated only for the special case of spherically symmetric and\nnon-rotating bodies. It is completely unclear how one might construct the Fermi normal\ncoordinates in real astronomical situations that are considerably more complicated. This\nmethod is inapplicable even to the Earth itself, which has oblateness and rotation that may\nnot be ignored (Kopejkin, 1988).\n(v). The proposed coordinate transformations between the RFs are incomplete, which significantly limits the applicability of the results obtained in real astronomical practice.\nAn important method of construction of the \'good\' proper RF was proposed by Thorne and\nHartle (1985) (see also Fujimoto & Grafarend (1986)) and developed to some extent by Zhang\n(1985, 1986) and Suen (1986). The Thorne-Hartle method is conceptually elegant and has\nproduced the largest corrections to the geodesic law of motion and the Fermi-Walker law of\ntransport (Misner et al, 1973). The method consists of determining the metric tensor from the\nHilbert-Einstein equations under the condition that one satisfies the properties of the well-defined\nproper RF that were mentioned above. Thus, the metric in this method is derived entirely in the\n\'good\' proper RF. The solutions of the gravitational field equations are searched for in a vacuum\nregion of space-time under de Bonder (harmonic) gauge conditions in the body\'s neighborhood\nwhere the gravitational field is weak. The metric tensor is represented in the form of an expansion\nin powers of the small parameters rriB/r,r/R, etc., where ms is the body\'s mass, r is a distance\nfrom the body, and R is an inhomogeneity scale (distance between the bodies). The coefficients of\nthe expansion are the internal and external multipole moments of the gravitational fields created\nboth by the body under consideration and the external gravity, respectively. In this method, the\ninformation about the properties of the chosen RF is completely contained in the set of these\nmultipole moments.\n22\n\nAlthough the Thorne-Hartle method represents an important progression in our understanding of the motion of unisolated bodies and their interaction with the external universe and\nprovides an important insight into the physical structure of a multipole expansion of the metric\ntensor in different RFs, it cannot be used immediately in ephemeris astronomy. The main reasons\nfor this are as follows:\n(i). The finding of the solutions of the Hilbert-Einstein field equations and the matching of\nthe asymptotic expansions were done formally. Since the goal of the paper was to find the\nlargest corrections to the laws of motion and precession only, the method does not provide\na complete multipole treatment of extended bodies. As a result, the internal multipole\nmoments are not presented as integrals over the volumes of the sources and therefore have\nno clear physical meaning (Kopejkin, 1988).\n(ii). The authors have not presented the coordinate transformation between the RFs used for\nthe analysis. They have constructed only the \'instantaneous\' proper RF, which coincides\nwith the body\'s center of inertia at a particular moment of time. As time goes on, the origin\nof the \'instantaneous\' proper RF propagates along a geodesic, but, in the general case, the\nbody\'s center of inertia world line does not. The deviation from the geodesic is caused by\nthe interaction of the body\'s own intrinsic multipole moments with the external gravity.\nThis leads to a drifting of the \'instantaneous\' proper RF from the body\'s center of inertia,\nwhich is not acceptable for astronomical practice (Soffel & Brumberg, 1991; Williams et\nal, 1991).\nAnother method of constructing of the \'good\' proper RF was proposed by D\'Eath (1975a,b)\n(see also papers by Kates (1980a,b) and Damour (1983)). These papers are devoted to the\nderivation of the eq.m. of compact, strongly gravitating astrophysical objects such as black holes\nand neutron stars. The authors have applied an interesting mathematical method of matched\nasymptotic expansions, which was not developed to be used in practical astronomical applications for the more common case of weakly gravitating bodies. There have been many works in\nwhich construction of the \'good\' proper RF has been accomplished with the help of infinitesimal transformations (Fukushima et al., 1986; Hellings, 1986; Vincent, 1986). Unfortunately, the\nmethods used in these works may not be considered to be satisfactory since they are based upon\nheuristic principles rather than exact theory (Kopejkin, 1988).\nThe critical breakthrough in construction of a relativistic theory of RFs appropriate for astronomical practice was achieved by Brumberg and Kopejkin (for a detailed description see\nKopejkin, 1985, 1987, 1988; Brumberg &; Kopejkin, 1988a,b; Voinov, 1990; Brumberg, 1991a,b,\n1992; Klioner & Kopejkin, 1992; Brumberg et al., 1993; Klioner, 1993; Klioner & Voinov, 1993).\nThe relativistic theory developed by Brumberg and Kopejkin combined the basic ideas of Fock\n(1955) on the post-Newtonian approximation scheme; Thorne (1980) and Thorne & Hartle (1985)\non multipole formalism; and D\'Eath (1975a,b), Kates (1980a,b), Kates & Madonna (1982), and\nD\'Eath & Payne (1992) on matched asymptotic expansions.\nThe Brumberg-Kopejkin method was the first to develop the three sub-problems of the gravitationally bounded astronomical N-body system. The authors identify the metric tensor of the\nrelativistic global problem with the solution of an isolated distribution of matter in the inertial\nRF obtained in the 1PNA of general relativity (Fock, 1955; Brumberg, 1972; Will, 1993). The\nsolution of the local problem is formally presented as an isolated one-body solution corrected\nby electric-type and magnetic-type external multipole moments (Thorne, 1980). The form of\n23\n\nthese moments reflects the properties of the proper RF chosen for the analysis of the gravitational environment of the body under study. The structure of these moments as well as the\npost-Newtonian coordinate transformations between the inertial and the quasi-inertial RFs are\nderived by matching both solutions in the body\'s neighborhood.\nThis method demonstrates a notable progression in the theory of astronomical relativistic\nRFs developed to describe the motion of a system of N extended bodies in the WFSMA. However,\nthis method also has some drawbacks:\n(i). The authors have made ad hoc assumptions about the various multipole expansions of the\nmetric tensor and coordinate transformations that are only partially justified by some later \xe2\x80\xa2\nconsistency checks (DSX, 1991).\n(ii). The method to derive the solution to the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational field equations of\nthe general theory of relativity based on the Anderson-DeCanio approach (Anderson &,\nDeCanio, 1975; Anderson, J. L. et al, 1982) is not covariant. In particular, based only on\nthis method, it is not possible to derive the explicit solution to these field equations in an\naccelerated proper RF linked to the body\'s center of inertia. As a result, the introduced\n\'external\' multipole moments do not have a clear physical meaning.\n(iii). The obtained relativistic coordinate transformation between the different RFs is incomplete\nas it contains only contributions from the leading intrinsic multipoles of the body (the mass\nmonopole and dipole and the current dipole). The contributions from the other intrinsic\nmultipoles are hopelessly mixed with the external moments in the structure metric tensor\nof the local problem. Thus, the transformation does not take into account the non-linear\ncoupling of the body\'s own gravitational field to external gravity even at the Newtonian\nlevel. As a result, the origin of the proper RF coincides with the center of inertia of the\nbody at a particular moment in time only, and, as time goes on, they will drift apart.\n(iv). The method under review does not provide us with the necessary microscopic description\nof relativistic phenomena in terms of densities of the gravitational fields. Thus, the mass of\nthe bodies, the momentum, and the angular momentum were never explicitly defined. The\nparameters introduced to substitute these quantities were never checked as to whether or\nnot they correspond to the integral conservation laws in the proper RFs of the bodies. In\naddition, the mass density of the gravitational field in the local region at the Newtonian level\nis given solely by the body\'s own mass density. But the local gravitational field contains\ntidal terms due to the external bodies. As a result, the theory does not admit a special\nrelativistic treatment of the N-body problem in the sense of the mechanics of Poincare.\nRecently, a very powerful approach to this problem has been elaborated by Damour, Soffel,\nand Xu (DSX, 1991-1994), Blanchet et al. (1995), and Damour &; Vokrouhlicky (1995). It\ncombines an elegant (\'Maxwell-like\') treatise of the space-time metric in both the global and local\nRFs with the Blanchet-Damour multipole formalism (Blanchet &; Damour, 1986). This approach\nallows one to relate the multipole expansions of the gravitational field to the structure of the\nsource of gravitation. This method, though very promising and attractive, still requires extensive\ndevelopment to make it useful for practical astronomical applications. Besides this, the method\nunder review has some problems that should be worked out in a more physically grounded way.\nThese include the following:\n\n24\n\n(i). The Blanchet-Damour \'external\' multipole moments were defined in the rest frame of an\nidealized isolated distribution of matter, so they must be modified in order to take into\naccount the non-inertiality of the proper RF as well as the interaction of the body\'s proper\ngravitational field with external gravity.\n(ii). The proposed relativistic coordinate transformation between the different RFs is incomplete\nbecause it does not take into account the terms due to interaction of the body\'s own\ngravitational field with external gravity. Moreover, the suggested coordinate transformation\ncompletely neglects the precession term and does not include the terms due to interaction\nof the body\'s intrinsic multipoles with the external gravity. This means that the proper RF\nconstructed with these transformations in the case of monopole structureless particles does\nnot end up with an RF defined on a geodesic line, which is guaranteed by the Principle of\nEquivalence. It should be noted that the origin of the proper RF, in the general case of\nextended bodies, coincides with the center of inertia of the local field in the initial moment\nof time only, and it drifts away as time progresses. This leaves the quantities, calculated\nwith respect to such a proper RF, physically ill defined (Damour & Vokrouhlicky, 1995).\n(iii). The solutions of the Hilbert-Einstein equations in the different RFs were obtained using\nnon-covariant gauge conditions. This does not provide one with a clear understanding\nof what part of the solution of the local problem is due to the gravitational field, what\nis caused by the contribution of the inertial sector of the space-time, and how these two\ninteract with each other.\n(iv). At this time, the method under review may not be extended for analysis of the WFSMA of\nother metric theories of gravity.\nIn light of this, the principle purpose of the present report is to develop a classic field approach\nto the problems of astronomical measurements in the WFSMA of a number of modern metric\ntheories of gravity. This approach will combine the well-established methods of the relativistic\nmechanics of Poincare with the Fock-Chandrasekhar treatment of the relativistic many-extendedbody gravitational problem (Fock, 1955, 1957; Chandrasekhar, 1965). One of the main goals of\nthis research was to develop a foundation for extending the applicability of the PPN formalism,\nwhich has become a very useful framework for testing the metric theories of gravity.\n\n25\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\n2\n\nParametrized Post-Newtonian Metric Gravity.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the status of the problem of constructing a solution to the gravitational field equations for a gravitationally bound astronomical N-body system. Within the\naccuracy of modern experimental techniques, the WFSMA provides a useful starting point for\ntesting the predictions of different metric theories of gravity in the solar system. Following Fock\n(1955, 1957), the perfect fluid is used most frequently as the model of matter distribution when\ndescribing the gravitational behavior of celestial bodies in this approximation. The density of\nthe corresponding energy-momentum tensor Tmn is as follows:\nTmn = ^([po(l + n) +p]u"V -pgmn),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere po is the mass density of the ideal fluid in coordinates of the co-moving RF, uk = dz k /ds\nare the components of invariant four- velocity of a fluid element, and p(p) is the isentropic pressure\nconnected with p by an equation of state. The quantity pH is the density of internal energy of an\nideal fluid. The definition of II is given by the equation based on the first law of thermodynamics\n(Fock, 1955; Chandrasekhar, 1965; Brumberg, 1972; Will, 1993):\n\nwhere p = ^/^pou0 is the conserved mass density. Given the energy-momentum tensor, one\nmay proceed to find the solutions of the gravitational field equations for a particular relativistic\ntheory of gravity. The solution for an astronomical N-body problem is the one of most practical\ninterest. In the following subsections, we will discuss the properties of the solution of an isolated\none-body problem as well as the features of construction of the general solution for the N-body\nproblem in both barycentric and planeto-centric RFs.\n\n2.1 An Isolated One-Body Problem.\nThe solution for the isolated one-body problem in the WFSMA may be obtained from the linearized gravitational field equations of a particular theory under study. As we mentioned above,\na perturbative gravitational field tiTR in this case is characterized by the deviation of the density\nof the general Riemmanian metric tensor ^/\xe2\x80\x94ggmn from the background pseudo-Euclidian spacetime 7mn, which is considered to be a zeroeth order3 approximation for the series of successive\niterations: ^/I::ggmn - x/^i"\xe2\x84\xa2 = Kffi, or equivalently,\n(2.3)\n\n9mn = 7mn + ^-\n\nThe search for the solution of the field equations is performed within a barycentric inertial RFo\n(xp) that is singled out by the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions imposed on the h$n(zp]\nand dkh$n(zp) (Fock, 1955; Damour, 1987; Will, 1993):\nlim\n\n(xp); r\n\n/ l\n\no\n\ni ( x\n\nP\n\n) +\n\n:/loi(lP)\n\n_\n\no,\n\n(2.4)\n\nr2 = --\n\nx\xc2\xb0 + r = const,\n3\n\nFor most non-radiative problems in solar system dynamics, this tensor usually is taken to be a Minkowski\nmetric (Damour, 1983, 1987; Will, 1993).\n27\n\nIn order to accumulate the features of many modern metric theories of gravity in one theoretical scheme, to create a versatile mechanism to plan gravitational experiments, and to analyze\nthe data obtained, Nordtvedt and Will have proposed a parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN)\nformalism (Nordtvedt, 1968a,b; Will, 1971; Will & Nordtvedt, 1972). This formalism allows one\nto describe the motion of celestial bodies for a wide class of metric theories of gravity within a\ncommon framework. The gravitational field in the PPN formalism is presumed to be generated\nby some isolated distribution of matter that is taken to be an ideal fluid, (2.1). This field is represented by the sum of gravitational potentials with arbitrary coefficients: the PPN parameters.\nThe two-parameter form of this tensor in four dimensions may be written as follows:\nftg) = -2U + 2(/3 - r)U 2 + 2V + 2r($2 - $w) + (1 - 2z/)x,oo +O(c~6),\nhg> = (2i + 2 - v C = 2^(7\n\nr)Va + (v + r}Wa + 0(c~5),\n- r}U - 2rUal3 + 0(cT4),\n\n(2.5a)\n(2.56)\n(2.5c)\n\nwhere jmn is the Minkowski metric.4 The generalized gravitational potentials are given in Ap-*\npendix A.\nBesides the two Eddington parameters (7,/?), eq.(2.5) contains two other parameters, v and\nT. The parameter v reflects the specific choice of gauge conditions. For the standard PPN\ngauge, it is given as v = i, but for harmonic gauge conditions, one should choose v = 0.\nThe parameter r describes a possible pre-existing anisotropy of space-time and corresponds to\ndifferent spatial coordinates that may be chosen for modelling the experimental situation. For\nexample, the case of T = 0 corresponds to harmonic coordinates, while T = 1 corresponds to the\nstandard (Schwarzschild) coordinates. A particular metric theory of gravity in this framework\nwith a specific coordinate gauge (v, T) may then be characterized by means of two of the abovementioned PPN parameters (7, /3), which are uniquely prescribed for each particular theory under\nstudy. In the standard PPN gauge (i.e., in the case when v = \\,T = 0), these parameters\nhave clear physical meaning. The parameter 7 represents the measure of the curvature of the\nspace-time created by the unit rest mass; the parameter (3 is the measure of the non-linearity\nof the law of superposition of the gravitational fields in the theory of gravity (or the measure\nof the metricity). Note that general relativity, when analyzed in standard PPN gauge, gives\n7 = j3 = 1, whereas, for the Brans-Dicke theory, one has /? = 1,7 = |^j, where u is an\nunspecified dimensionless parameter of the theory.\nThe properties of an isolated one-body solution are well known. It has been shown (Lee et\na/., 1974; Ni & Zimmerman, 1978; Will, 1993) that for an isolated distribution of matter in\nthe WFSMA there exist a set of inertia! RFs and ten integrals of motion corresponding to ten\nconservation laws. Therefore, it is possible to consistently define the multipole moments characterizing the body under study. For practical purposes, one chooses the inertial RF located in\nthe center of mass of an isolated distribution of matter. By performing a power expansion of the\npotentials in terms of spherical harmonics, one may obtain the post-Newtonian set of \'canonical\'\n4\nDo not mix the post-Newtonian parameter 7 and the Minkowski metric tensor f m n distinguish the determinant det||7mn|| with the special symbol.\n\n28\n\nAs necessary, we will\n\nparameters (such as unperturbed irreducible mass I^,L and current S^,L multipole moments)\ngenerated by the inertially moving extended self-gravitating body (A) under consideration:\nT\n2 W\n\n_ [ f fj3 J fOO( >P\\ \'W]STF\nJ \'\n\nA(0) - [ /.

As a result, the corresponding gravitational field h^ may\nbe uniquely represented in the external domain as a functional of the set of these moments.\nSchematically this may be expressed as\n\nwhere the functional dependence, in general, includes a non-local time dependence on the \'past\'\nhistory0 of the moments (Blanchet et al., 1995). However, by assuming that the internal processes\nin the body are adiabatic, one may neglect this non-local evolution. As a result, an external\nobserver may uniquely establish the gravitational field of this body through determination of\nthese multipole moments, for example, by studying the geodesic motion of the test particles in\norbit around this distribution of matter (Misner et al., 1973).\n\n2.2\n\nThe Limitations of the Standard PPN Formalism.\n\nIt turns out that the generalization of the results obtained for the one-body problem into a\nsolution of the problem of motion of an arbitrary N-body system is not quite straightforward.\nThus, the studies of post-Newtonian motion of extended bodies in PPN formalism begin by\nexpanding the generalized gravitational potentials in the metric tensor and the corresponding\neq.m of these bodies with respect to deviation from Newtonian motion. As a final result, one\nneeds to have the generalization of expression (2.66) for the case of the N-body problem. However,\nthis generalization is usually done by using Galilean coordinate transformations similar to those\nof (1.2) from the Newtonian mechanics (Fock, 1955; Will, 1993):\nx\xc2\xb0 = y\xc2\xb0B + 0(c-2),\n\nxa = y\xc2\xabBo(y\xc2\xb0B) + y% + O(c~*},\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere 7/3 is the Newtonian barycentric radius vector of the body (B) under study. It was\nnoted that this accuracy is enough for the post-Newtonian terms in these eq.m. (Brumberg,\n1972), but it is insufficient to account for the necessary special relativistic and gravitational\ncorrections. Thus, as we know, if the body is spherically symmetric in the proper RF, in the other\nframe it will experience both the Lorentzian contraction (linked to the relative velocity between\nthese frames) in the direction of velocity between these RFs and gravitational compression (or\n\'Einsteinian\' contraction, which is linked with the external gravity) (Kopejkin, 1987). However,\ntransformations (2.7) ignored completely these Lorentzian and gravitational contractions, as\nwell as the relativistic geodetic precession and effects of the curvature of space-time. All these\nkinematic and dynamic effects appear in the expressions for the metric tensor and eq.m. of the\nlocal problem, where they are shown as terms depending on both (i) the \'absolute\' velocity of the\nbody\'s center of inertia with respect to the barycentric inertia! RFo and (ii) the absolute value\nand first spatial derivative of the external gravitational potential C/ext. As a result, the relativistic\neq.m. of the local problem differ essentially from the Newtonian eq.m., which do not depend on\nthe \'absolute\' velocity and contain only the second spatial derivative of \xc2\xa37ext, i.e., the tidal terms.\n5\nGravitational radiation problems are not within the scope of the present report and, hence, the set of multipole\nmoments, (2.6a), are used for both tensor and scalar-tensor theories.\n\n29\n\nThe correct way to describe these phenomena is to use the appropriate coordinate transformations\nbetween the different RFs in the WFSMA. These transformations should generalize the expressions\nof the Poincare group of motion, (1.7), for the problem of motion of the gravitationally bounded\nN-extended-body system. However, the standard PPN formalism was formulated once in the\ninertial RF and there is no way to construct such a transformation for the quasi-inertial proper\nframes of the bodies. This lack of transformation between the different RFs is a major limitation\nof this otherwise very useful method.\nNevertheless, by putting some additional restrictions on the shape and internal structure of\nthe bodies, one may generalize the results presented above in the case of an N-body system.\nThe assumption that the bodies possess only the lowest multipole mass moments considerably\nsimplifies the problem. It has been shown (Fock, 1955; Lee, Lightmann & Ni, 1974; Ni &\nZimmerman, 1978) that for an isolated distribution of matter in the WFSMA it is possible to\nconsistently define the lowest conserved multipole moments, such as the total rest mass of the\nsystem, MQ; its center of mass, ZQ ; the momentum, p$ ; and the total angular momentum, SQ ,.\nof the system. The definitions for the mass MQ and coordinates of the center of mass of the^\nbody ZQ in any inertial RF are given by the following formulae (for a more detailed analysis see .\nDamour (1983) and Will (1993) and references therein):\n\nMo =\n\nJ\n\ndV \xc2\xa3\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb0(z\'P),\n\nzg(t) =\n\n- dV i\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb0(z/JVa,\nMO J\n\n(2.8a)\n\nwhere the energy density <\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0(x\'p) of the matter and the gravitational field is given by\n\ni\xc2\xb0 V) = p[i + c-2(n - it/ - i\xc2\xabx) + <^~4)] ,\n\n(2-86)\n\nwith p being the conserved mass density. In particular, the center of mass ZQ moves in space with\na constant velocity along a straight line: ZQ(I} = PQ \xe2\x80\xa2 t + ka, where the constants p% = dzft/dt\nand k1^ are the body\'s momentum and center of inertia, respectively. Moreover, it was shown by\nChandrasekhar & Contopulos (1967) that, in the case of point-like massive particles, the form\nof metric tensor (2.5) and the corresponding EIH eq.m. are invariant under coordinate transformations (1.12). This form invariancy justifies the word \'inertial\' for harmonic RFs constructed\nunder the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions (2.3). One may choose from the set of inertial\nRFs the barycentric inertial RFo for such a system. In this frame, the functions ZQ must equal\nzero for any moment of time. This condition may be satisfied by applying the post-Galilean\ntransformations (1.12) to the metric (2.5), where the constant velocity and displacement of the\norigin should be selected in a such a way that PQ and ka equal zero (for details, see Kopejkin,\n1988; Will, 1993). The solar system barycentric RF0, constructed using general relativity for\nthe system of point-like massive particles, is widely in use in modern astronomical practice, for\nexample, in the construction of planet ephemerides (Moyer, 1971; Lestrade and Chapront-Touze,\n1982; Newhall et al, 1983; Akim et a/., 1986; Standish, 1995). Moreover, the coordinate time of\nthe solar system barycentric (harmonic) RFo must be considered as the TDB time scale, which\nis extensively used in modern astronomical practice (Fukushima, 1995a).\n2.2.1\n\nThe Simplified Lagrangian Function of an Isolated jY-Body System.\n\nIn order to extract the information about the gravitational field of an N-body system, one should\nstudy the ,motion of light rays and test bodies in this gravitational environment. However, the\nstandard methods of the PPN formalism (Will, 1993) do not enable us to develop the correct\n30\n\ntheoretical model of the astrophysical measurements with the accuracy necessary to identify\nthe multipolar structure of the gravitational fields of the bodies. In particular, it was noted\nthat taking into account the presence of any non-vanishing internal multipole moments of an\nextended body significantly changes its equations of motion due to the coupling of these intrinsic\nmultipole moments of the body to the surrounding gravitational field. For example, for a neutral\nmonopole test particle, the external gravitational field completely defines the feducial geodesic\nworld line that this test body follows (Fock, 1955; Will, 1993). On the other hand, the equations\nof motion for spinning bodies contain additional terms due to the coupling of the body\'s spin to\nthe external gravity through the Riemann curvature tensor (Papapertou, 1948, 1951; Barker &\nO\'Connel, 1975).\nAn \'absolute\' limit of the PPN formalism takes into account the lowest multipole moments\nof the bodies only, such as the rest mass mA of the body (A), its intrinsic spin moment SA,\nand the quadrupole moment IA. The general solution with such assumptions is also known (see\nDamour, 1986, 1987 and references therein, and Turyshev, 1990). In order to analyze the motion\nof bodies in the solar system barycentric RFo, one may obtain the restricted Lagrangian function\ndescribing the motion of N self-gravitating bodies, which may be presented as follows:\nL\n\n^-^ m,A\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e/\n\n1\n\nu\\\n\nv^ v^ mAinn ( 1\n\n,\n\n0\n" = 2^ -o-^/i^" (i - -7VA^} -2^2^ \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94B ~ + (3 + 7 -\n\nA\n\n4\n\nA B\xc2\xb1A\n\nAB\n\n\\\n\n1\n3\n1\n-(7 -T+ -)v Af ,v A ^ + (7 - r + -^VA^VB^ - (- +\n\n(2.9)\nA\n\nwhere mA is the isolated rest mass of a body (A), the vector r\xc2\xb0^ is the barycentric radius vector\nof this body, the vector r\\B = r\'B \xe2\x80\x94 rcA is the vector directed from body (A) to body (B), and the\nvector n%\xc2\xa3 = r\'AB/rAB is the usual notation for the unit vector along this direction. It should be\nnoted that expression (2.9) does not depend on parameter i^, which confirms that this parameter\nis the gauge parameter only. The tensor 7^" is the STF (Thorne, 1980) tensor of the reduced\nquadrupole moment of body (^4), defined as\n\nThe tensor Sjf is the body\'s reduced intrinsic STF spin moment which is given as:\n= \xe2\x80\x94 I d?z\'ApA(z\'A}[vK ~ &\n"tA J A\n\nwhere u^ is the velocity of the intrinsic motion of matter in the body (A). Finally, the quantity\nEA is the body\'s gravitational binding energy:\n\n\\ZA\n\nA\n\n31\n\nZ\nA\n\nLet us note that the Lagrangian function is obtained with the condition that, in the proper\nRF of each body (A) in the system, the body\'s dipole mass moments vanish:\n=\n\n=\n\n= 0,\n\n(2.13a)\n\nwhere \xc2\xa34\xc2\xb0 is denned by the following expression:\n\n- l-UA - \\v^)\n\n+ C?(c-4)] .\n\n(2.136)\n\nExpression (2.13a), together with the condition m\\ = 0, may be considered as an indirect\npost-Newtonian definition of the proper RFyi in the PPN formalism.\n2.2.2\n\nThe Simplified Barycentric Equations of Motion.\n\nIn this subsection, we will present the barycentric equations of motion that follow from the\nLagrangian function (2.9). The assumption that bodies in the system possess the lowest intrinsic\nmultipole moments enables us to obtain only the corresponding simplified equations of motion.\nThus, with the help of the expressions (2.9), for an arbitrary body (A), these equations will read\nas follows:\n\n(2(3 + 2j-2r + l}mA + (2/3 + 27 - 2r)mB}] +\nn\nTAB ^\n\xc2\xa3\n\nm*mc^BC + 0(c-6),\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere, in order to account for the influence of the gravitational binding energy Eg, we have\nintroduced the passive gravitational rest mass MB (Nordtvedt, 1968b; Will, 1993) as follows\nMB = mB (l + (3 + 7 - 4(3}EB + 0(<T4)) .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe unit vector UAB must also be corrected using the gravitational binding energy and the tensor\nof the quadrupole moment 7^ of the body (A) under question:\n= "AS l + (3 + 7 ~ ^)EA + 5nAB),nABlM^- + 1nABp-\xc2\xb1- + O(c~4}.\nV\n\nT\n\nAB \'\n\nT\n\n(2.16)\n\nAB\n\nThe term A^B in expression (2.14) is the orbital term, which is given as follows:\n\n~ (27 - (7 + 1 + r)v A BxVAB - 3T(n ABx v AB X ) 2 - 2 (\xc2\xabABA^) 2 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe spin-orbital term B^B ^L8tS\n\n32\n\n(2-17)\n\n= (\xc2\xa7\n\n(2.18)\n\nThe term C^B is caused by the oblateness of the bodies in the system:\nC*AB = 2nAB/3I\xc2\xb00 + 5n^BnABXnABflI^.\n\n(2.19)\n\nAnd, finally, the contribution T>%bc to the equations of motion (2.14) of body (A) (caused by the\ninteraction of the other planets (B^A, C^A,B) with each other) is presented as\n\n-IS\n\nwhere A^B = rf-" + n^sn^B and\noperators, respectively.\n\n= ry^" +\n\nare the projecting and the polarizing\n\nThe metric tensor (2.5), the Lagrangian function (2.9), and the equations of motion (2.14)(2.20) define the behavior of the celestial bodies in the post-Newtonian approximation in the\nPPN formalism. These equations may be simplified considerably by taking into account that\nthe leading contribution to these equations is the solar gravitational field. With such an approximation, they are used to produce the numerical codes in relativistic orbit determination\nformalisms for planets and satellites (Moyer. 1981; Huang et al, 1990; Ries et al., 1991; Standish\net al., 1992) as well as to analyze the gravitational experiments in the solar system (Will, 1993;\nPitjeva, 1993; Anderson et al., 1996). It should be noted here that in the present numerical\nalgorithms for celestial mechanics problems (Moyer, 1971; Moyer, 1981; Brumberg, .1991; Standish et al., 1992; Will, 1993), the bodies in the solar system are assumed to possess the lowest\npost-Newtonian mass moments only, namely, the rest masses and the quadrupole moments. The\ncorresponding barycentric inertial RFo defined in the harmonic coordinates for general relativity\n(7 = /? = l;^ = T = 0) has been adopted for the fundamental planetary and lunar ephemerides\n(Newhall et al., 1983; Standish et al., 1992).\nHowever, if one attempts to describe the global dynamics of the system of N arbitrarily shaped\nextended bodies, one will discover that even in the WFSMA this solution will not be possible without an appropriate description of the gravitational environment in the immediate vicinity of the\nbodies (Kopejkin, 1988; DSX, 1991). Thus, one needs to present the post-Newtonian definition\nfor the proper intrinsic multipole moments for the bodies in order to describe their interaction\nwith the surrounding gravitational field as well as to obtain the corresponding corrections to\nthe laws of motion and precession of the extended bodies in this system. This could be done\ncorrectly only by using the theory of the quasi-inertial proper RF with well-defined dynamic and\nkinematic properties. In the next section, we will discuss a new perturbative method for finding\nthe solution for the relativistic N-extended body problem and will formulate the corresponding\ntheory of relativistic astronomical RFs in curved space-time.\n33\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\n3\n\nWFSMA for an Isolated Astronomical N-Body System.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the principles of a new iterative method for generating the solutions\nto an arbitrary N-body gravitational problem in the WFSMA. This formalism will be based upon\nthe construction of proper RFs in the vicinities of each body in the system. Such frames are\ndefined in the gravitational domain, dg, occupied by a particular body (B). One may expect\nthat, in the immediate vicinity of this body, its proper gravitational field will dominate, while\nthe existence of the external gravity will manifest itself in the form of the tidal interaction only.\nTherefore, in the case of the WFSMA in the closest proximity to the body under study, this\nproper RF should resemble the properties of an inertial frame, and the solution for an isolated\none-body problem h^m should adequately represent the physical situation. However, if one\ndecides to perform a physical experiment at some distance from the world tube of the body,\none should consider the existence of the external gravity as well. This is true because external\ngravity plays a more significant role at large distances from the body, and this should be taken\ninto account. As we noticed earlier in Section 1, the physically adequate description of this\nnature of gravity could be made in the well-justified proper RF only. Let us mention that the\ndynamical properties of the inertial frames presently are well justified and correctly modelled\nboth physically and mathematically. In particular, the properties of the barycentric inertial RFo\nare based upon the properties of an N-body generalization of an unperturbed isolated one-body\nsolution of the gravitational field equations in an inertial RF given by (2.5). These properties\nare well established and widely in use in modern astronomical practice (Moyer, 1971; Moyer,\n1981; Brumberg, 1991; Will, 1993). However, as we discussed earlier, this N-body generalization\nis based on the assumption that the bodies in the system possess the lowest intrinsic mass\nand current multipoles only. In order to account for the influence of higher-order multipoles,\nthe coordinate transformations to the proper RF are necessary. This proper RF should take\ninto account both Lorentzian and Einsteinian features of the motion of extended bodies in the\nexternal gravitational field. In the next subsection, we will concentrate on formulating the basic\nprinciples of a new method for constructing such transformations for a wide class of metric\ntheories of gravity.\n\n3.1 The General Form of the JV-Body Solution.\nIn order to construct a general solution for the N-body problem in a metric theory of gravity,\nlet us make a few assumptions. First of all, let us assume that there exists a background spacetime 7mn with the dynamic and cosmological properties discussed in the Section 1. Note that\nthese properties do not forbid the existence of incoming and outgoing gravitational radiation.\nWe will discuss this case further. We shall assume that the solution of the gravitational field\nequations h!$n for an isolated unperturbed distribution of matter is known and is given by\nrelations (2.5). We further assume that for each body (B) in the system, one may establish a\nunique correspondence to each such solution: (B) ^ hmn \xe2\x80\xa2\nWith these assumptions, we may construct the total solution of the global problem gmn in an\narbitrary RF as a formal tensorial sum of the background space-time metric 7mn, the unperturbed\nsolutions /4nn plus the gravitational interaction term h^n. Thus, in the coordinates xp = (x\xc2\xb0, xv]\nof the barycentric inertial RFo, one may search for the desired total solution in the following form:\n\n35\n\nwhere the coordinate transformation functions yqB = yqB (xp) are yet to be determined.\ninteraction term h^n will be discussed below.\n\nThe\n\nIn order to describe the matter distribution, let us assume that the corresponding Lagrangian\nfunction 1$ may be given as\nN\nriot\n\\^ L (0)B\nT\nT int\nM - Z^ M + LM >\nB\n\nL\n\nwhere Lffi is the Lagrangian describing interaction between the bodies. Then, the total energymomentum tensor of matter in the system may be presented as follows:\n2\xc2\xb0 (xs] = 2\n\nT^(VR(X S }} + 2\n\n= \\ ^\n\n(3 2)\n\nFor the case of compact and well separated bodies, we may take into account that the mutual\ngravitational interaction between the bodies affects their distribution of matter through the metric tensor only. Therefore we can neglect the second term in the expression above6. Then without\nany loss of accuracy, we obtain the total energy-momentum tensor of the matter distribution in\nthe system in the following form:\n\nB=l\n\nB=l\n\nwhere T$ is the energy-momentum tensor7 of a body (B) as seen by a co-moving observer.\nThe unperturbed solution hmn for the field equations in the WFSMA is presented in the\nform of the double power series with respect to two small scalar parameters: the gravitational\ncoupling constant G and the orders of c"1. It is clear that a similar set of small parameters\nmay be used in order to construct an iterative N-body solution at least at the post-Newtonian\nlevel in the WFSMA. This means that all the functions and fields involved in the perturbation\nscheme (such as the interaction term h^, the coordinate transformation functions yqB = y B (x p ),\nthe energy-momentum tensor T^n, etc.) are also power expanded with respect to these small\n6\n\nIt is also true, if one recalls the result, that the interaction between the gravitational fields in the 1.5 postNewtonian physics will appear in the poo component of the metric tensor only and will have an O(c~4) order of\nmagnitude.\n7\nAs a partial result of representation (3.3), one can see that the Newtonian mass density PB of a particular body\n(B) is defined in the sense of a three-dimensional Dirac delta function. Thus, in the body\'s proper compact-support\nvolume, one will have PB = TnB<5(t/J3)> so that\n\n1.\nwhere SAB is the three-dimensional Kronekker symbol (63 = SAB\\ SAB = 1 for A = B and 0 for A =\xc2\xa3 B). Then in\nany RF^, the total density ~p of the whole N body system will be given by the expression p(y^) = yig pB(y^).\nThis representation allows one to distinguish between the local and integral descriptions of the physical processes\nand, hence, provides correct relativistic treatment of the problem of motion of an astronomical N-body system.\n\n36\n\nscalar parameters. At this point, the actual form of the energy-momentum tensor Tmn is not\nof great importance. We prefer to keep this arbitrariness in our further calculations. The only\nrestriction we will apply to the possible form of this tensor is based on the physical expectations;\nwe will limit ourselves to such tensors which have the components of the following orders: TOO ~\nOne may establish the properties of solution (3.1) with respect to an arbitrary coordinate\ntransformation simply by applying the basic rules of tensorial coordinate transformations. In\nparticular, in the coordinates if A (x q ) = (y^, y^) of an arbitrary proper RF^, this tensor will take\nthe following form:\n\n(3-4)\nThe expression for Tmn(y^) could be obtained analogously to that given by equations (3.3). To\ncomplete the formulation of the perturbative scheme, we need to introduce the procedure for*\nconstructing the solutions for the various unknown functions entering expressions (3.1)-(3.4),,\nincluding the four functions of the coordinate transformations yqB = y^(y^) and the interaction,\nterm\nWe will construct the four functions of the coordinate transformations by applying the relativistic theory of celestial RFs in a curved space-time. To do this, we will use the most general\nform of the post-Newtonian non-rotating coordinate transformation between the bary centrical\n(inertial) coordinates (zp) and the bodycentrical (quasi-inertial) coordinates (y^):\n(3.5a)\n(3.56)\n\nwhere y^0(y^) is the Newtonian radius vector of body (A). Transformations (3.5) should complement the post-Galilean coordinate transformations (1.12) in the case of the curved space-time\ngenerated by an arbitrary N-body system. Note that transformations (3.5) are presented as being parametrized by the set of three unknown functions, KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^. This is an example\nof that which will be referred to as the KLQ parameterization for the WFSMA. The functions\nKA,LA, and Q^ are expected to contain the information about the specific properties of the\nquasi-inertial RF^ associated with the body (A). The form of these functions will be determined\nby the iterative procedure for constructing the quasi-inertial proper\nThe way to construct the solution for the interaction term hl\xc2\xa3fn \'is quite straightforward: It\nis sufficient to require that the metric tensor in the form of eq.(3.1) or (3.4) will be the explicit\nsolution of the gravitational field equations in the corresponding RF. Note that the second term\nin eq.(3.1) is linear with respect to the unperturbed solutions h\\^ and that the transformation\nfunctions between the different RFs are determined by means of the external gravitational field in\ntheir origins. Only the interaction term should contain the information about the dynamic nonlinearity of the gravitational interaction. The form of this term should depend on the physical\n37\n\nfeatures of the RFs chosen for the analysis. It should be noted that the search for the solution in\nthe barycentric RFo is physically and mathematically more appropriate then in the bodycentric\none. Moreover, to date no analysis has been made to propose a covariant boundary condition for\nthe case of the non-inertial RF rather then the \'classical\' Fock-Sommerfeld one. It is known that\nthese conditions are applied asymptotically to the entire gravitational field from the system at\nthe infinitive distance from the latter and are valid for the isolated distribution of matter. This\nmeans that making use of the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions (Brumberg &; Kopejkin,\n1988a; DSX, 1991-1994) in a proper RF is mathematically weakly founded in order to find the\ngeneral solution of the field equations in this frame. Based on this conclusion, we will perform\nthe search for the /i\xe2\x84\xa2\xc2\xa3 in the coordinates of the barycentric inertia! RFoBy taking into account that all the functions and fields in expressions (3.1)-(3.5) are presented in the form of a power expansion with respect to the set of small parameters, one may\norganize an iterative procedure in order to obtain the general solution for the problem. The two\nprinciple steps of this procedure are the supplementary conditions necessary for the solution of\nthe gravitational field equations, which may be expressed by both the covariant gauge conditions ..\'\nand the boundary conditions.\nIn the proposed formalism, these conditions are taken to be as follows:\nThe covariant gauge, conditions. The solutions of the field equations are assumed to satisfy..\nthe covariant harmonical de Bonder gauge, which, for an arbitrary RFB, may be written as\nfollows:\n0,\n(3.6)\nwhere T>% is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric 7^n(2/jg) of the inertial Riemannflat (R^midmnd/B^} = 0) space-time in these coordinates.8 For most of the interesting practical\nproblems in the WFSMA, this metric may be represented in quasi-Cartesian coordinates as the\nsum of two tensors, the Minkowski metric jmn and the field of inertia <\xc2\xa3mn:\n\n(3.7)\nNote that the term <j)mn appears to be parameterized by the coordinate transformation functions\nKA, LA, and Q% defined in eqs.(3.5); thus, we have <^mn(y^) = (j)mn[KA, LA, QA], a formulation\nthat will be referred to as the KLQ parameterization in the WFSMA.\nThe advantage of using these gauge conditions is that they allow us to construct the solutions\nto the field equations in a unique way without applying the technique of the, so-called, \'external\nmultipole moments\' (Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a; DSX, 1991). The conditions of eqs.(3.6) do\nnot fix the harmonic RF in a unique way and, in definition of coordinates of this frame, some\narbitrariness may still exist. Indeed, the coordinate transformation y\'g = ifB + C\xc2\xa3(T/|) with\nthe function (^ satisfies the equation 9mn(ypB)\'D^Pn CB(J/B) = 0 does not violate the chosen\nconditions (3.6). In all the particular cases, the remaining freedom of the harmonic RF might be\n8\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates of the inertial Galilean RF0, the flat metric 7^n can be chosen as 7mi =\ndiag(l, -!,-!,\xe2\x80\x94 1), so that the Christoffel symbols T^S\' = 0 all vanish and conditions (3.6) take the more familiar\nform of the harmonic conditions\nwhich are equivalent to setting v = T = 0 in eqs.(2.5).\n\n38\n\nfixed by choosing the specific CS associated with the proper RFs for describing the dynamics of\nthe N bodies in the system.9\nThe boundary conditions. The search for the general solution for h^(xp) is performed in\na barycentric inertial RFo, which is singled out by the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions\nimposed on the hmn and dkh mn -\xc2\xbb\n\nt + - = const,\n\n0,\n\n(3.8a)\n\nwhere r2 = \xe2\x80\x94 7J\xc2\xab/ x^z". Note that conditions (3.8) must be satisfied along all past Minkowski\nlight cones. Thus, these conditions define the asymptotically Minkowskian space-time in a weak\nsense, consistent with the absence of any flux of gravitational radiation falling on the system\nfrom an external universe (Damour, 1983, 1986). Moreover, one assumes that there exists such\na quantity h\xe2\x84\xa2?? = const (for the solar system, this constant is of the order of \xc2\xab 10~5) for which\nthe condition\nhmn(xp) < h\xe2\x84\xa2\n(3.86)\nshould be satisfied for each point (x) inside the system: |x| < Lp. Note that any distribution\nof matter is considered isolated if conditions (3.8) are fulfilled in any inertial RF (Damour, 1983; \'\nKopejkin, 1987, 1988).\nBy making use of conditions (3.8), we have an opportunity to determine the interaction term\n^mn(xP) m a UQique waY while solving the gravitational field equations of a metric theory of\ngravity.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Post-Newtonian KLQ Parameterization.\n\nIt is well known that for practical description of the translational and rotational motions of\nthe N-body system, one should introduce at least (N + 1) different RFs (Brumberg & Kopejkin,\n1988; DSX, 1991). It is desirable that one of these frames be the inertial barycentric (RFo)\nwith coordinates denoted as (xp) = (X\xc2\xb0,X M ). The origin of these coordinates is located at the\ncenter of the field of the entire N-body system. This particular RF will be used to describe\nthe global dynamics of the whole system. The other N frames should be convenient for the\ndescription of the local gravitational environment in the immediate vicinity of the particular\nbody (B) under consideration. The origins of corresponding coordinate grids, (?/^) = (y^, y^),\nshould be associated with the centers of the local fields of the interacting bodies of interest.\nIn this subsection, we will establish the general relationships describing the straight, inverse,\nand mutual coordinate transformations between the different quasi-inertial RFs. We will show\nthat, in the WFSMA, all these different types of coordinate transformations may be parametrized\nby the same set of functions, KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0(. As a result, we will reconstruct in the general form\nof the post-Newtonian non-linear group of motion the background pseudo-Euclidean space-time\nfor the WFSMA.\n9\n\nOr equivalently, by choosing some specific form of gmn (Thorne, 1980; Hellings, 1986; Fukushima, 1988) and\nthe internal and \'external\' moments in a vacuum power expansion of the metric tensor gmn in a set of multipoles\n(Kopejkin, 1988; DSX, 1991).\n\n39\n\n3.2.1\n\nThe Properties of the Coordinate Transformations in the WFSMA.\n\nAs we mentioned above, in order to construct the relativistic theory of the RFs in celestial mechanics, one should not only solve the global and local problems, but also one should establish the\nrules of the coordinate transformations between these solutions that belong to the different RFs.\nTo do this, let us discuss the expected physical and mathematical properties of the coordinate\ntransformations given by expressions (3.5) in the form\nx\xc2\xb0 = y\xc2\xb0A +\n\nThese coordinates are expected to cover space-time in the immediate vicinity of the body\nunder consideration. It is clear that such a mapping of the space-time may be performed by both\nthe barycentric and bodycentric coordinates. This suggests that these coordinate transformations1\nshould be reversible. The functions K A ,L A , and Q\xc2\xb0^ should contain the information about thespecific physical properties of the RF chosen for analysis. It is generally believed that, in order\nto produce the transformations to the physically justified proper RF, the following properties of\nthese functions should be satisfied:\n(i). The functions K A ,L A , and Q^ should be completely defined by means of the external\ngravitational field at the origin of the coordinate system of the proper RF^ of body (A)\nfor which the physically adequate proper RF is constructed. These functions should not\ncontain any terms caused by the pure gravitational field of body (A) besides those with the\ncoupling of the internal multipole moments of body (A) to the external gravitation.\n(ii). In order to obtain reversible transformations, the transformation functions should be homogeneous and infinitely differentiable. Then, based on assumptions about the properties\nof a well-justified proper RF (given in the Section l), the functions KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^ should\nadmit an additional Taylor expansion in power series of the spatial coordinate y^. For\nconvenience, these series may originate on the world line of the center of the local field in\nthe vicinity of body (A), so that these functions could be expressed as follows:\n\nfA(y\xc2\xb0A, y^ = \xc2\xa3 lfA{L}(y\xc2\xb0A} \xe2\x80\xa2 y{AL},\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere function /A^AIJ/A) \'s anv function from K A ,L A , or Q^. As a result, the second\nderivatives taken from these functions will not depend on the order of the derivative\'s\napplication, namely,\n\nwhere the brackets are the usual notation for the commutator: [a, 6] = ab \xe2\x80\x94 ba.\n(iii). At the limit when gravitation is absent (G \xe2\x80\x94> 0), the theory becomes Poincare-invariant\nand transformations (3.5) should coincide with those of Poincare (between two frames in\nuniform relative motion with a velocity v plus transition of origin and arbitrary rotation),\nwhich are given by eqs.(1.7).\n\n40\n\n(iv). At the other limit, when N \xe2\x80\x94> 1, and the problem may be described by the one-body gravitational field solution (2.5), the transformations should coincide with that of ChandrasekharContopulos, (1.12), for the uniform motion between the two RFs in the isolated one-body\nproblem.\n(v). For the gravitational theories, whose foundations are based upon the Equivalence Principle,\nthe physical properties of constructed RFs should be generic for all the bodies in the system.\nOtherwise, the possible violation of this principle (which may be induced by the possible\ndependence of the gravitational coupling on the shape/size/composition of the bodies)\nshould be taken into account while the proper RF is constructed.\n3.2.2\n\nThe Inverse Transformations.\n\nThe transformations given by eq.(3.5) transform space and time coordinates from the barycentric\nspace-time RF (xp) to space and time coordinates in the proper RF^ (y^)- However, in practice\none needs to make the comparison between the proper time and position in different RFs and,\nhence, it is necessary to have the inverse transformations to those of eq.(3.5) and the mutual\ntransformations between the two proper quasi-inertial frames as well. The existence of the\nsmall parameters and the assumptions in (3.9) and (3.10) make it possible to generate these\ntransformations in a general form as well as to construct the group of motion for the problems in\nthe WFSMA. Thus, the general condition of the inreversibility of transformations (3.5) is given\nas usual:\n\nExpressions (55) from Appendix B enable us to present this condition in an arbitrary RF obtained\nwith the WFSMA as follows:\n\n\xc2\xab + 0(c~<) jt 0(c~a).\n\n(3.116)\n\nNote that this condition is satisfied for most of the problems in modern celestial mechanics. A\nsimilar analysis has been made by Brumberg & Kopejkin (1989) for the dynamics of the planets\nin the solar system. It was shown that the determinant vanishes at the distance r* ~ (? /\\O,E\\ ~\n7.5 \xe2\x80\xa2 1020 cm from the center of mass of the Earth. From this it follows that, in spite of an\ninitial construction of a geocentric RF in the region lying inside the lunar orbit, it is possible to\nsmoothly (without intersecting) prolongate the spatial coordinate axes of the geocentric RF for\nmuch larger distances beyond the orbit of Pluto.\nWe will search for the post-Newtonian transformations that will be inversed to those of eq.(3.5)\nin the following form:\ny\xc2\xb0A = x\xc2\xb0 + c-2KA(x\xc2\xb0, xe) + c-4LA(x\xc2\xb0, x\xc2\xa3) + O(c~&}xQ,\nVA = *a ~ 2/20(z\xc2\xb0) + c-2QaA(x\xc2\xb0, xe] + 0(c-4)xa,\n\n(3.12a)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(3.126)\n\nwhere the functions K A ,L A , and Q% are unknown at the moment. One can show that in\nthe WFSMA, these functions may be expressed in terms of functions KA, LA, and Q\\ written in\n\n41\n\ncoordinates (xp) of the barycentric RFo- In order to find the expressions for KA, LA, and Q\\, let\nus substitute relations (3.5) into eqs.(3.12) and then expand the obtained relations with respect\nto the small parameters: G ~ c~2. Thus, for the spatial components we will obtain\n(y\xc2\xb0A(x\xc2\xb0: xa)\n(c-4)y%.\n\n(3.13)\n\nThis equation enables us to find the expression for Q^(z\xc2\xb0, xe) in terms of functions Q0^\nand KA. By expressing the arguments of the transformation functions yA (y^(x\xc2\xb0,x a )} and\nQ%(y^(\xc2\xa3\xc2\xb0, z a ), yA(x\xc2\xb0, x a )J in terms of coordinates (xp) and expanding the obtained relations in\nthe power series of the small parameter c"1, we will get\n0(c-4)xa,\n\n,x<) + 0(c-4)xQ,\n\n(3.14q), .\n\n(3.146)\n\nwhere\n\nA\n\nThen, by substituting eqs.(3.14) into eqs.(3.13), we will obtain the expression for the function\n<%(zV\xc2\xa3):\n(55(x\xc2\xb0,xe) = -Q a A (x\xc2\xb0,x\xc2\xab - y"Ao(x\xc2\xb0)) - v%0(x\xc2\xb0) \xe2\x80\xa2 K A (x\xc2\xb0,x<) + O(c~*}xa.\n\n(3.15)\n\nBy repeating this procedure for the temporal components of transformations (3.12), we may\nobtain the expressions for functions K A (x\xc2\xb0,x f ) and L A (x\xc2\xb0,x e ) as well:\n,x*} = -K A (x\xc2\xb0,x< - y \xc2\xa3 Ao (x\xc2\xb0)) + O(c~V,\n\n(3.16)\n\nL A (x\xc2\xb0, ze) = -LA x\xc2\xb0, x* - y^(x\xc2\xb0) -\n\n, a f) + 0(c^x0.\n\n(3.17)\n\nMaking use of the resulting expressions for functions KA, LA, and Q^, which are given by relations\n(3.15)-(3.17), from equation (3.12) we finally obtain the inverse transformations between proper\nand barycentric kinematically non-rotating RFs in the most general form:\n\n42\n\ny\xc2\xb0 = x\xc2\xb0-- c -A =\n\n2\nA\n\nx\xc2\xb0 , x -<\n\n0x\n\n\xc2\xb0 + c-4[ -\n\nC-\n\n6\n\n)x\xc2\xb0\n\nC?(c-4)xa-\n\n(3.18a)\n\n(3.186)\n\nNote that the method used to derive expressions (3.18) corresponds to finding such coordinate\ntransformations y^ = y^(x9) which transform the space- time j\xc2\xa3n of the proper RF^ to that of\nthe barycentric inertial RFo with the Minkowski metric jmn in Cartesian coordinates. The latter\nmay be presented as follows: ds1 = ^^(y^dy^dy^ = c?dt2 - dx2.\n\n3.2.3\n\nThe Coordinate Transformations Between the Two Proper RFs.\n\nThe ability to make the power expansion with respect to the small parameters allows us to\norganize the iterative procedure for constructing the mutual coordinate transformation between\nthe two different proper RFs, namely RF^ and RF#. The definition of the proper RF, (3.5), was\ngiven based on the clearly defined physical properties of the barycentric inertial RFo for the entire\nN-body system. The transformation functions connecting the two proper RFs are easy to find by\napplying the same procedure that was used for the construction of the inverse transformation,\n(3.18). Thus, by making use of expressions (3.5) and (3.18), we may find the following relations\nfor the mutual coordinate transformation:\n= \xc2\xb0\n\n-2\n\n-*\xc2\xb0\n\n-*\xc2\xb0 A ,\n\n(3.19a)\n\n(3.196)\nwhere functions KB A, LBA, and Q%A are given as follows:\n(3.20a)\n\n(3-206)\n\n(3.20c)\n\n43\n\nRelations (3.5) and (3.18)-(3.20) represent the necessary expressions for developing the perturbation theory in the WFSMA for the problems of the dynamics of an astronomical gravitationally bounded system of N self-gravitating arbitrarily shaped extended bodies. The transformations are presented in a functionally parameterized form by the two scalar functions, KA and\nLA, and one three- vector function, Q^. Assuming all the bodies in the system are described by\nthe same model of matter, one may conclude that the form of all these functions should be the\nsame for any RF. This property of the transformations reflects the fact that a proper RF may\nbe defined in a general way for each body in the system. Moreover, one can see that expressions\n(3.19)-(3.20) represent the group of motion that preserves the form-invariancy of the metric tensor 7^ of the background pseudo- Euclidean space-time for any proper RF. This means that the\nRFs, constructed this way, should be equivalent and, hence, the physical phenomena will behave\nexactly the same way in all of them.\n3.2.4\n\nNotes on an Arbitrary Rotation of the Spatial Axes.\n\nIn this subsection, we will show how one may generalize the results obtained on the case of the\ntransformations between dynamically rotational coordinate RFs. The need for such a coordinate\nsystem may appear, for example, in the case when one will relate the VLBI, LLR, and the planetary ephemeris RFs as well as in the case of relating the celestial and terrestrial frames (Folkner \xe2\x80\xa2\net al., 1994; Sovers & Jacobs, 1994). The most general form of post-Newtonian transformations\nbetween the coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFo to those (y^) of the proper RF^,\nwhich are undergoing the rotational motion of the spatial axes with an arbitrary time-dependent\nrotational matrix 72.^ (y^), may be presented in the following form:\n\nO(C-e}y%\n\n(c^}y%\n\n(3.21o)\n\n(3.216)\n\nThe matrix T^^/A) represents both the rotation and the time-dependent deformation of the\nspatial axes:\n*%(&) = <(&>\n\n+ *%(&),\n\n(3-22)\n\nwhere the first term is symmetric, a^ = cr^, and it represent the rescaling of the coordinates\nwith respect to time. The second term is anti-symmetric, u/^" = \xe2\x80\x94u1^, and it describes the\nrotation of the spatial axes of the coordinate grid in the proper RF^. Besides this, the tensor u)^\ncontains the information about the precession and nutation of the spatial coordinates (Kopejkin,\n1988; Fukushima, 1991; Folkner et al, 1994; Sovers & Jacobs, 1994).\nIn the case when det ||7\xc2\xa3^"|l ^ 0, one may find the inverse transformations to those given\nby expressions (3.21). To do this, we may repeat the same iterative procedure discussed above.\nMaking use of this method, one may easily obtain these inverse transformations in the following\nform:\n= x\xc2\xb0- KA x\xc2\xb0, x< - yV\xc2\xb0)\n\n44\n\n+ L\'A(x\xc2\xb0, ze) + O(cT V,\n\n(3.23o)\n\n"\'\n\ns fr*L \xe2\x80\x94 I \\ /v /\n\n11 \\\n\n/\n\nu\n\n11\n\n/\n\nM\\ \\\n\nw\n\n/\n\nII\n\nc\n\nc\n\n/\n\n\\\\\\ \\\n\n.\n\nf** s\n\n_ A\\\n\n/v\n\n/OOOLN\n\nwhere the function L"A is given as\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 QxA(x\xc2\xb0, x< 0(c-6)x\xc2\xb0\n\n(3.23c)\n\nwith the differential operator fj,(x\xc2\xb0, x\xe2\x82\xac] taking the form\n\n-^O^A 1 )^\n\nNote that if we neglect the rotation (i.e., will take the rotation matrix in the form of the Kronekker symbol, 72/^(2\xc2\xb0) = 6% ), the differential operator eq.(3.24a) becomes\n(3-246)\n\nand the coordinate transformations (3.23) coincide with those of eq.(3.18) for the dynamically\nnon-rotating case.\nFor most practical applications in modern astronomy, one may neglect the effects due to the\ntime-dependent deformation of the axes and assume that the body is undergoing rigid threedimensional rotation with the rotational matrix taken in the form "^^"(y^) = ^"(S/A)- ^n ^e\nproper RFA of an isolated rotating body, the following equation describes the dynamic properties\nof the tensor\n\nwhere VA = e^w^ is the vector of the angular velocity of rotation of the body (A). Usually, for\nmost of the problems in relativistic celestial mechanics, one assumes that the angular velocity\nof the rotation of the celestial bodies is of the following order of magnitude: VA ~ G(c~2}vAQ,\nwhere VA is the barycentric velocity of the translational motion of the body (A) moving along\nits world line (DSX, 1991). Then, taking this condition into account, one may neglect the time\nderivative terms from the transformation matrix in relations (3.23) and make use of the standard\ntheory of coordinate transformations with rigid spatial rotation of the proper KFA. Otherwise,\nfor a general case with an arbitrary rotation, one should keep these terms in the post-Newtonian\nparts of transformations (3.23).\n45\n\nFollowing the procedure depicted above, we may obtain the mutual transformations between\nthe coordinates of two rotating RFs. Furthermore, one may extend the results obtained above to\nthe case of the non-uniform rotation of an elastic body (B) with the rotational matrix taken in\na general form, Ttf\xc2\xa3(i/B,y6B). However, for the problems of celestial mechanics in the WFSMA,\nthis generality is not necessary. Moreover, in 1991 the IAU made the recommendation that, in\norder to avoid the appearance of the fictitious forces (Coriolis-like) acting on a observer in the\nproper RF, all coordinate transformations for astronomical applications should not introduce any\nrotation of the spatial axes at all (Fukushima, 1991; Brumberg, 1991; Klioner, 1993). For this\nreason, we will limit ourselves in our further discussion solely to the case of the non-rotational\ncoordinate transformations, leaving the problem of rotation for other publications.\n\n3.3\n\nThe Definition of the Proper RF.\n\n-:\n\nIn this subsection, we will finally present a way to find the transformation functions necessary for\nconstructing a proper RF with well-defined physical properties. As one can see from expressions\n(3.4), in the WFSMA the main contribution to the geometrical properties of the proper RF^\nin the body\'s immediate vicinity comes from its own gravitational field, hmn \xe2\x80\xa2 Then, based on\nthe Principle of Equivalence, the external gravitational influence should vanish at least to the\nfirst order in the spatial coordinates (Synge, 1960; Manasse & Misner, 1963). The proper RF^,\nconstructed this way, should resemble the properties of a quasi-inertial (or Lorentzian) reference\nframe and, as such, will be well suited for discussing the physical experiments. Note that the\ntensors limn, and h^n represent the real gravitational field that no coordinate transformation\ncan eliminate everywhere in the system. In the case of a massive monopole body, one can\neliminate the influence of external field on the body\'s world line only. However, for an arbitrarily\nshaped extended body, the coupling of the body\'s intrinsic multipole moments to the surrounding\ngravitational field changes the physical picture significantly. This means that the definition of the\nproper RF for the extended body must take into account this non-linear gravitational coupling.\nIn order to suggest the procedure for the choice of the coordinate transformations to the\nphysically adequate proper RF^, let us discuss the general structure of the solution 5^(2^)\ngiven by expression (3.4). Thus, in the expressions for g^n, one may easily separate the four\nphysically different terms. These terms are:\n(i). The Riemann-flat contribution of the field of inertia 7^n given by expression (3.7).\n(ii). The contribution of the body\'s own gravitational field /4nn \xe2\x80\xa2\n(iii). The term due to the non-linear interaction of the proper gravitational field with an external\nfield.10\n(iv). The term describing the field of the external sources of gravity. This term comes from the\ntransformed solutions /4rm and the interaction term h^.\nThe first contribution depends on the external field in the gravitational domain occupied by\nthe body (A) and appears to be \'parametrized\' by transformation functions (3.5). Note that\nfor any choice of these functions, by the way they were constructed, the obtained metric g^n\n10\n\nThis contribution is due to the Newtonian potential and the potential $2 in expressions (2.5). These interaction\nterms show up as the coupling of the body\'s intrinsic multipole moments with the external field.\n\n46\n\nsatisfies the gravitational field equations of the specific metric theory of gravity under study.\nFurthermore, based on the properties of the proper RP^ discussed above, one may expect that\nthe functions KA,LA, and Q\\ should form a background Riemann-flat inertial space-time j^n\nin this RF that will be tangent to the total gravitational field in the vicinity of the body (-A)\'s\nworld line, 7^. Moreover, the difference of these fields should vanish to first order with respect to\nthe spatial coordinates (i.e., the \'external\' dipole moment equals zero (Thome &: Hartle, 1985)).\nThese conditions, applied to moving test particles, are known as Fermi conditions (Fermi, 1922;\nManasse &: Misner, 1963; Misner et al, 1973). We have extended the applicability of these\nconditions to the case of a system composed of N arbitrarily shaped extended celestial bodies.\nIn order to obtain the functions KA,LA, and Q^ for coordinate transformation eq.(3.5), we\nwill introduce an iterative procedure that will be based on a multipole power expansion with\nrespect to the unperturbed spherical harmonics. To demonstrate the use of these conditions, let\nus denote #^n(y^) as the local gravitational field, i.e., the field that is formed from contributions\n(ii) and (iii) above. The metric tensor in the local region in this case can be represented by the\nexpression ffmn (y^) = Jmn + H^^y1^). Then the generalized Fermi conditions in the local region\nof body (A) (or in the immediate vicinity of its world line, 7^) may be imposed on this local\nmetric tensor by the following equations:\n(3.26a)\n,\n\n(3.266)\n\nwhere 7 is the world line of the point of interest and the quantities Tmn (y^) are the Christoffel\nsymbols calculated with respect to the local gravitational field, 9mn (y^)- Application of these\nconditions will determine the functions KA,LA,<indQ^, which are as yet unknown. Moreover,\nthis procedure will enable us to derive the second-order ordinary differential equations for the\nfunctions J/^O^A) an<^ Q^(y% 0)> or> m \xc2\xb0tner words, to determine the equations of the perturbed\nmotion of the center of the local field in the vicinity of body (A).\nRelations (3.26) summarize our expectations based on the Equivalence Principle about the\nlocal gravitational environment of the self-gravitating bodies. By making use of these equations,\nwe will be able to separate the local gravitational field from the external field in the immediate\nvicinity of the bodies. However, these conditions only allow us to determine the transformation\nfunctions for the free-falling massive monopoles (i.e. only up to the second order with respect\nto the spatial coordinates). Transformation functions (3.5) in this case will depend only on the\nleading contributions of the external gravitational potentials UB and Vg and their first derivatives\ntaken on the world line of body (A). The results obtained will not account for the contribution\nof the multipolar interaction of the proper gravity with the external field in the volume of the\nextended body. This accuracy is sufficient for taking into account the terms describing the\ninteraction of the intrinsic quadrupole moments of the bodies with the surrounding gravitational\nfield, but some more general condition, in addition to eq.(3.26), must be applied in order to\naccount for the higher multipole structure of the bodies.\nThus, as we shall see later, conditions (3.26) enable one to obtain the complete solution\nfor the Newtonian function KA- Functions LA and Q^ may be defined up to the second order with respect to the spatial point separation, namely LA, Q\'A ~ ^(|2/2I 3 )\' so the arbitrariness\n\n47\n\nof higher orders (k > 3) in the spatial point separation will remain in the transformation. In\norder to get the corrections to these functions up to the kth order (k > 3) with respect to the\npowers of the spatial coordinate y\\, one should use conditions that contain the spatial derivatives\nof the metric tensor to the order (k \xe2\x80\x94 1). The mathematical methods of modern theoretical\nphysics generally consider local geometrical quantities only and involve second-order differential\nequations. These equations alone may not be very helpful for constructing the remaining terms\nin functions LA and Q\xc2\xb0^ up to the order k > 2. However, following Synge (1960), one may apply\nadditional geometrical constructions, such as properties of the Riemann tensor and the FermiWalker transport law (Misner & Manasse, 1963; Ni, 1977; Ni &; Zimmermann, 1978; Li &; Ni,\n1978, 1979a,b). Another possibility is to postulate the existence of so-called \'external multipole\nmoments\' (Thorne, 1980; Blanchet &; Damour 1986; Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a; DSX, 19911994). However, those moments are defined through vacuum solutions of the Hilbert-Einsteiri\nfield equations of general relativity in an inertial RF, while the influence of external sources of\ngravity are ignored. Defining the moments in this way is essentially equivalent to defining the\nstructure of the proper RF for the body under question.\nThe most natural approach for defining the desirable properties of the proper quasi-inertial\nRFs for the system of extended and deformable bodies is to study the motion of this system in .\nan arbitrary KLQ-parametrized frame. There are two different ways to do that, namely: (i) to\nstudy the infinitesimal motion of each element of the body, or (ii) to study the motion of a whole .\nbody with respect to an accelerated frame attached, for example, to the center of inertia of the\nlocal fields of matter, inertia, and gravity. In our method, we will use the second way and will\nstudy the dynamics of the body in its own RF. Our analysis will be directed toward finding the\nfunctions KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^ with the condition that the Riemann-flat inertial space-time i\ncorresponding to these functions will be tangent to the total Riemann metric grand/a)\nentire system in the body\'s vicinity. Physically, one expects that this inertial space-time will\nproduce a \'fictitious\' (or inertial) force with density fxLQ acting on the body in its proper RF.\nAt the same time, the body is under the influence of the overall real force due to the local fields of\nmatter and gravity with density fg. Thus, the condition for finding the transformation functions\nKA, LA and Q^ is conceptually simple; the difference between these two densities, F = fo\xe2\x80\x94/KLQ,\nshould vanish after integration (or averaging) over the body\'s compact volume:\nSF = / d?y\'A? = I d3y\'A(f0 - f KLQ ) = 0.\n\nJA\n\nJA\n\n^\n\n\'\n\n(3.27)\n\nNote that the notion of \'the center of mass\' in this case loses its practical value, and one should\nsubstitute instead \'the local center of inertia.\' Thus, the force /KLQ should provide the overall\nstatic equilibrium for the body under consideration in the local center of inertia, which is defined\nfor all three fields present in the immediate vicinity of the body, namely: matter, inertia and\ngravity. Let us mention here that in practice it is not possible to separate these two forces, /o\nand fKLQ, from each other. Fortunately, we will be able to obtain the difference between them,\nf. This will considerably simplify the further analysis.\nIn order to construct the necessary solution for functions KA, LA, and Q^ in a way that will\nbe valid for a wide class of metric theories of gravity, one must first analyze the conservation\nlaws in an arbitrary KLQ-parameterized RF. This could be done based on the conservation law\nfor the density of the total energy-momentum tensor T7"71 of the whole isolated N-body system:\nV^rmn(^) = 0,\n48\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere V^ is the covariant derivative with respect to the total Riemannian metric g^nti/A) m\nthese coordinates. Then, by using a standard technique for integration with the Killing vectors,\none will have to integrate this equation over the compact volume of the body (A) and one can\nobtain the equations of motion of the extended body (Fock, 1957; Chandrasekhar, 1965; Will,\n1993). Then the necessary conditions, equivalent to those of (3.27), may be formulated as the\nrequirement that the translational motion of the extended bodies vanishes in their own RFs.\nThis corresponds to the following conditions applied to the dipole mass moment m^ = JTJ^ :\n\nwhere the quantity m\\ is calculated based on the total energy-momentum tensor matter, inertia,\nand gravitational field taken jointly (similar to the condition of eq.(2.12)). These conditions may\nalso be presented in a different form. Indeed, if we require that the total momentum P\xc2\xa3 of the\nlocal fields of matter, inertia, and gravity in the vicinity of the extended body vanish, we will\nhave the following physically equivalent condition:\ndPa\n\n= ^=0.\n\n(3.296)\n\nThese conditions finalize the formulation of the basic principles of construction of the relativistic\ntheory of celestial RFs in the WFSMA.\nThis method is demonstrated to be a useful tool in practical analytical and numerical calculations for a number of metric theories of gravity (Turyshev et a/., 1996). Thus, the properties\nin the derivation of the unperturbed solutions for a number of metric theories of gravity11 may\nbe used in order to produce the general solution for the problem of motion of an N-body system.\nIn each particular case, for a specific theory of gravity there exists the common strategy for\nconstructing the iterative procedure, which may be expressed as follows:\n1. One should first choose the particular model of matter distribution, Tmn, and define the\nsmall parameters relevant to the particular problem under consideration. The next step\nis to perform the power expansion with respect to these parameters for all the functions\nand fields entering the gravitational field equations of a particular metric theory of gravity\nand, by using the standard methods of the WFSMA (Fock, 1955; Will, 1993), to find the\nunperturbed solution for an isolated distribution of matter, n^m2. Then, by using the obtained unperturbed solutions and the WFSMA theory of the coordinate transformations (developed in Appendix B), construct the general form of the\nsolution for the total metric tensor from the anzatz eqs.(3.1)-(3.4). Then, by using the\ngeneralized de-Donder harmonical gauge and the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions,\n(3.8), construct the interaction term, h^, and present the solution in coordinates of inertial\nbarycentric RFo and in an arbitrary, KLQ-parameterized quasi-inertial RF.\n3. In order to find the functions KA,LA, and Q\\ of the coordinate transformation to the\ncoordinates of the proper RF/i and fix the remaining coordinate freedom, one should apply\nthe procedure for constructing the proper RF. First of all, find the solution for these functions by implementing the conditions of eqs.(3.26) in a local region of the body. Then by\n"The solutions for an isolated distribution of matter (the global problem) are well known, and one may find\ntheir general properties in Will (1993).\n\n49\n\ngeneralizing the obtained result on the case of an arbitrary extended body, integrate the\nlocal conservation law (3.28) over the body\'s volume, in order to obtain the general form\nof the coordinate transformations from conditions (3.29).\n4. In order to obtain the final multipolar solution for the astronomical N-body problem, one\nshould substitute the obtained transformations into the generalized gravitational potentials.\nThen, by making the expansion of these quantities in the triple power series with respect\nto small parameters (gravitational constant G, the inverse powers of the speed of light c"1,\nand the parameter of the geodesic separation A^ ~ y^/lj/BAol)) one wiM have obtained the\ndesired representation for the metric tensor and the corresponding equations of motion.\nIn the following sections, we will discuss the application of the proposed perturbation formal-:\nism for the solution of the problem of motion of an arbitrary astronomical N-body system in the\ngeneral theory of relativity.\n\n50\n\n4\n\nGeneral Relativity: Solutions for the Field Equations.\n\nIn this section, we will apply the iterative formalism discussed in the previous section to construction of solutions for the problem of motion of the system of N extended bodies in the theory of\ngeneral relativity with a perfect fluid as a model for matter distribution. In this section, we will\nobtain the solution for the Hilbert-Einstein field equations and a perfect fluid model of matter\ndistribution in its application for solving the problem of motion of N extended self-gravitating\nbodies in the WFSMA. We will present these solutions in both barycentric inertial and proper\nquasi-inertial RFs. To do this, we must obtain all the necessary transformation rules under the\ngeneral coordinate transformations discussed in the previous section. In order to simplify the\ndiscussion in this section, all these rules were obtained in a general form and are presented in\nthe appendices, which will be referred to as necessary.\nThe gravitational field equations of the general theory of relativity were discovered in 1915\nand presented by Einstein (1915a,b) (for more details see Misner et al. (1973)) as follows:\n\n= -- ^-\n\n(fmn - ^9mnT) \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(4.1)\n\nLet us mention that these equations were independently obtained and studied also by Hilbert\n(1915). At the present time, there exists confidence that a relativistic theory of astronomical RFs\nmust be founded on the equations of the general theory of relativity, (4.1). The mathematical\nelegance of the field equations as well as the simplicity of the physical foundations of this theory\nmade it particularly easy to perform and analyze the relativistic gravitational experiments. Thus,\ngeneral relativity has passed many serious tests both in the weak gravitational field of the solar\nsystem (Will, 1993) and the strong-gravitational-field test based on the data obtained from the\ncontinuous observations of the double pulsar PSR 1913+16 (Damour, 1987; Damour & Taylor,\n1992). It should be noted that presently the analysis of high-precision measurements of the\nlight deflection and the delay of propagation time of radio signals in the solar gravitational field\nconfirms the WFSMA of the general theory of relativity with an accuracy on the order of 1.5%\nand 0.5%, respectively. Concerning the practical applications, we must mention that most of\nthe modern methods for relativistic data reduction as well as the solar system ephemerides are\nbased upon the predictions of equations (4.1) with the perfect fluid model of matter (2.2). This\nis why we begin the application of the new method for construction of the relativistic theory of\nthe RFs in the WFSMA from the general theory of relativity.\n\n4.1\n\nThe Solution for the Interaction Term.\n\nLet us assume that the non-gravitational forces are absent, the bodies are well separated, and\nthe bodies\' matter may be described by the model of a perfect fluid with the density of energymomentum tensor Tmn, given by expressions (2.1)-(2.2). As we have previously discussed, all\nthe field equations and the boundary and initial conditions for this problem are much better\ndefined mathematically in the coordinates of the inertial RFo, so it is quite natural to begin the\ndiscussion within this reference frame. In Section 2, we assumed that the general solution for\nthe gravitational field equations gmn in coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFo may be\nwritten as follows:\nB\nBB\np\\ _ -, (~p\\ , Vs\nh^ B (ifl (TP^ -4- h int\nVB\n^ B (ifl (TP^ -4- hi\nkl\n) \xe2\x80\x94 7mn(.X ; -t- 7 j JTm~Q V\n^^\n>\'\nB=1\n\n51\n\nAt this point, we already have all the necessary \'tools\' to construct the metric tensor gmn(xp}.\nLet us recollect all the gained knowledge, which is necessary to obtain this tensor, namely:\n(i). The unperturbed solution for the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational field equations, hkl , for\nan isolated distribution of matter with the perfect fluid model of matter distribution presented by the energy-momentum tensor, Tmn, eq.(2.1), in coordinates of inertial RFo has\na simple form and in terms of the tensor, hmn , it is given by expressions (2.5) with the\nconditions 7 = / ? = l , i / = r = 0.\n(ii). The general transformation rules of these solutions under the coordinate transformations\n(3.5) with the transformation matrix as in eqs^CQ) are established in the form of relations\n(D7).\n(iii). The transformation properties of the gravitational potentials, which are defined in Appendix A, are given by expressions (E9a), (E14a], (El5a), and (El6a).\nBy substituting all these expressions into formula (4.2), we will obtain the following expressions\nfor the metric tensor gmn in the coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFo:\n\n, (4.3a)\naA^(*P) + 0(c~5),\n\n(4.36)\n\nB\n\n(4.3c)\n\nwhere interaction term hl^<4> is the only term that hasn\'t yet been specified. In order to find\nthis term, one should use the Hilbert-Einstein field equations, eq.(4.1), written in the coordinates\nof inertial RFo and expanded with respect to the small parameter, c"1.\nThe necessary expansions for the Ricci tensor, Rmn-. eq.(B9), and for the modified energymomentum tensor, Smn, which is defined by eqs.(512-B13), are given correspondingly by the\nexpressions (.D3) and (-DH) in this CS. By making use of these expressions, one may obtain\nthe linearized Hilbert-Einstein field equations for an N-body system. Finally, by equating the\nexpressions with the same orders of magnitude, with respect to powers of the small parameter,\nc"1, we will obtain the following equations:\n\n52\n\nvA\n\n<2>\n\n7\n\n,-4\\\n\nT"s?s?\xc2\xabS><*\'> = 8">\n\n+\'\n\n:^3>(*p) = -\n\n7\n\ni/A\n\n.z\n+\n\n(4.46)\n\n+\n\n(4.4c)\n\n--AAI.\n>x^\n\n^\n\nx^l =\n\n(4.4d)\nB\n\nBy substituting into these equations the expressions for the metric tensor gmn(xp} given by\nrelations (4.3), one may see that the first three equations from (4.4) are automatically satisfied\nfor the components g^>(xp},g^>(xp), and 9oa>(a;p) of the metric tensor. However, the last\nequation from this system, eq.(4.4d), written for the component 5ob4>, produces the necessary\nequation for the determination of the interaction term h^<4> as follows:\n\n7\n\nx\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2]-\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe general solution to this equation is easy to obtain and it may be written as follows:\n\n53\n\nB\n\n0\n\xc2\xb0\n\n+PB,\n\nn,\n\nx\xc2\xb0, x7" - y\xc2\xa30(z\xc2\xb0) UB(x\xc2\xb0, x\'\xc2\xbb)\n\n+ W<*>(x\xc2\xb0, x") + C?(C-6),\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere summations over both (B) and (B\') are from 1 to N. The only requirement on the arbitrary\nfunction W^)4> is that it should satisfy the ordinary Laplace equation:\n\nThe solution to equation (4.7) has terms with both possible asymptotics: one falling off at infinity\n~ l/r k and the other divergent, i.e., ~ rk. The choice of the solution should be made in order\nto account for cosmological, galactic, or gravitational wave contributions to the behavior of the\nmetric tensor gmn at large distances from the system. If there is no incoming radiation falling on\nthe system from outer space and the background metric is accepted as having been satisfied for\nthe cosmological conditions of the PPN gauge,12 then the Fock-Sommerfeld boundary conditions\nof eq.(3.8) enable us to choose the past-stationary and asymptotically Minkowskian solution to\nthe field equations of general relativity (Damour, 1983). However, for further calculations we\nwill retain the function W(^4> as unspecified.\nBy substituting the obtained result for the interaction term /ioot<4> in *ne expression for the\ntemporal component of the metric tensor, eq.(4.3a), we could write the final solution for the\nHilbert-Einstein field equations in coordinates (zp) of the inertial barycentric RFo as follows:\n\n(4.8o)\n12\n\nThe main requirement is that the cosmological evolution of the background metric be described by the\nRobertson-Walker cosmological solution at large distances from the system of the bodies under consideration\n(Will, 1993).\n\n54\n\ng0a(x\xc2\xb0,x\xc2\xbb) = 4\xc2\xa3>*A^(xp) + 0(c-5)}\n\n(4 86)\n\nB\n\n+ 2\xc2\xa3;t/B(zp)) + 0(cT4).\n\n(4.8c)\n\nB\n\nThe obtained expressions, (4.8), are the usual form of the general solution for the global problem in general relativity of the isolated distribution of matter, which was first obtained by Fock\n(1957) (see also Fock, 1955; Damour, 1986; Kopejkin, 1989; Will, 1993). It is easy to see that the\ngeneral solution for the N-body problem in the barycentric inertial RFo, eqs.(4.8), demonstrates\nthe property of linear superposition of unperturbed fields hmn boosted by transformations (3.18)\nin components g^>(xp},g^p>(xp}, and 9o\xc2\xa3>(xp) of the metric tensor. The non-linear contribution due to the motion of the bodies and their gravitational interaction with each other appears\nbeginning in component g^o > (x p } through the interaction term /ioo\'<4>) which is given by relation (4.6). One may note that the interaction term contains three groups of terms with physically\ndifferent origins, namely:\n(i) . The first seven terms are due to the boost of the isolated unperturbed solutions hmn by\ntransformations (3.18).\n(ii). The eighth term is due to the mutual gravitational interaction between the bodies in the\nsystem.\n(iii). The last term, W0^4>, is caused by the possible inhomogeneity of the background spacetime.\nIt is clear that the terms of the first group are frame dependent (or coordinate dependent).\nHence, these terms are responsible for the coordinate dependence of the quantity /i0ot<4> in\ngeneral. This implies that this term depends on the properties of the proper coordinate system\nchosen for description of the internal problem in the vicinity of a body (B) in the system. We\ncan continue the analysis of these terms in the barycentric inertial RFo. However, for further\ncalculations, it will be more convenient to shift the discussion to the proper\nThe transformation properties of the interaction term are given by the relations (-D9). These\nrelations suggest that, in the first post-Newtonian approximation, the form of the interaction\nterm in the coordinates (y^) of the proper RF/i could be obtained by taking into account the\ntransformation properties of the gravitational potentials only. Thus, by making use of the direct\ntransformations (3.5) with the transformation matrix (Cl), one may write the interaction term\nin the coordinates of the proper RF^ as follows:\n\n0(c~e),\nwhere the following notations have been accepted:\n\n55\n\n(4.9a)\n\n-2v Aox (y\xc2\xb0 A )\xc2\xab^(yO )\n(4.96)\n\n=4\n(4.9c)\nd*y\' APB y% y\'A + y\xc2\xbbB\n\nUB(ypA}- axBo(y\xc2\xb0A) \xe2\x80\xa2 - y\xc2\xbbBAo(y\xc2\xb0A)} \xe2\x80\xa2 UB(lft\n\n+ O(c~*},\n\n+PB\'(y\xc2\xb0 A ,y\'X - y U B\' A M))u B (y 0 A ,y\'X)\\ + O(C-e).\n\n(4.9d)\n\n(4.9e)\n\nThe physical meaning of these new functions is quite clear. The functions /i^t<4> and /iBlt<4> are\nthe post-Newtonian contributions of the unperturbed solutions hmn for body (A) and all the rest\nof the bodies (B^A) in the system, boosted by transformations (3.5) and (3.20). The function\n^AB<4> ^s *he contribution describing the gravitational interaction of the body (A) with the rest\nof the bodies in the system. And the last term, /i^f4^ is the function, physically analogous to\nthe previous one, but describing the gravitational field generated by the gravitational interaction\nof the rest of the bodies in the system (B, B\' /A) with each other in the vicinity of the body (A).\nThe advantage of using conditions (3.8) is that they provide an opportunity to determine the\ninteraction term /i^(xp) in a unique way. It should be stressed that the corresponding solution\n56\n\n9mn(xp) in the barycentric iiiertial RFo resembles the form of the solution for an isolated onebody problem, (2.5). The only change that should be made is to take into account the number\nof bodies in the system: p \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xbb \xc2\xa3B PB, where PB is the compact-support mass density of a body\n(B) from the system. However, both the interaction term /i^n(2/a) an(i the total solution for the\nmetric tensor gmn in the coordinates (y^) appear to be \'parameterized\' by the arbitrary functions\nKA, LA, and Q0^. This result reflects the covariancy of the gravitational field equations as well\nas the well denned transformation properties of the gauge conditions, (3.6), used to derive the\ntotal solution. This arbitrariness suggests that one could choose any form of these functions in\norder to describe the dynamics of the extended bodies in the system. However, as we noticed\nearlier, the unsuccessful choice of the proper RFA (or, equivalently, the functions KA,LA, and\nQ\xc2\xb0\xc2\xa3) may cause an unreasonable complication in the future physical interpretations of the results\nobtained.\n\n4.2\n\nThe Solution of the Field Equations in the Proper RF.\n\nOnce the interaction term hl^<4> has been defined, one may easily obtain the form of the\ngeneral solution to the Hilbert-Einstein field equations gmnd/^) in the coordinates of the proper\nRF.A- This solution may be obtained directly from the tensor gmn(xp) by the regular tensorial\ntransformation law as follows:\ndxk dxl\n- -\n\n, .,\n9kl(x\n\nD..\n\ndxk dxl\n\nIn order to obtain the final result for the metric tensor gmn in the coordinates of the proper\nwe should establish and then make use of the transformation properties of all the quantities\npresented in expression (4.10).

The transformations of the unperturbed solutions hmn from the coordinates (y^) of the\nproper RF# to those of the RF^ are presented by relations (D8).\n(Hi). The transformation properties of the interaction term tiff were established and discussed\nin the previous subsection, where they were given by relations (4.6) and (4.9).\n(iv) . The transformation properties of all the potentials, which enter the above-named formulae,\nare given by eqs.(\xc2\xa396), (\xc2\xa3146), (\xc2\xa3156), and (\xc2\xa3166).\nBy substituting all these quantities into relations (4.10), we will obtain the components of\nthe metric tensor gmn(y^\\) in the coordinates of the proper RF^ as follows:\nQ\nA) -\n\n2 \xc2\xa3 UB(ypA)+\n\nB\n\n57\n\n-\n\n(4.116)\n\n= la/3 + \'<JA OQ (y A )v Ao0 (y 0 A ) +\n\nwhere the post-Newtonian term #o54> in the component ^oo(y^) of equation (4.11a) denotes the\nfollowing expression:\n\n\xc2\xa3 l[ \xc2\xab\n\n*(!&(\xc2\xa3))J\n\n+ ^i<4>(^) + ^4>(^) + *#>(\xc2\xa3).\n\n(4.i2a)\n\nThe latter expression may be presented in terms of the generalized gravitational potentials as\nfollows:\n\n-4\n\n(4.126)\nThe first three terms in expression (4.12a) describe both the unperturbed gravitational field of\nthe body (A) , boosted by the coordinate transformations (the terms h0QA\nand /i^t<4> ) , and the\ngravitational field produced by the interaction of this field with one produced by the rest of the\nbodies in the system (the term /i^B<4>)- These are the terms that govern the local gravitational\nenvironment in the immediate vicinity of the body (A), producing the major contribution to the\nequations of motion of the test particles orbiting this body. The next three terms in expression\n(4.12a) are the terms that are due to the boosted unperturbed gravitational fields produced by\nthe rest of the bodies in the system and the gravitational field caused by their interaction with\neach other, presented in the coordinates of the proper RFA. This external gravitational field\nshould appear in the equations of motion of the test particles around the body (A), written in\nthe coordinates of the proper KFA, in the form of a tidal interaction only (Synge, 1960). Note\nthat the approach discussed here is the generalization of the concept of the neutral test particle\n58\n\nfreely falling in the external gravitational field. It is known that, up to these tidal corrections,\na freely falling test particle will behave as if external gravity is absent (Bertotti &; Grishchuk,\n1990). In our case, the extended body (A) is not moving freely; instead, as we will see later,\nits internal multipole moments are couples to the external gravitational field through the terms\n^wt<4> an(j ^jnt<4> -j^is COUpiing produces a force that results in the deviation of the center of\nmass of this body from the support geodetic line along which it would move if it were a neutral\ntest particle (Denisov & Turyshev, 1989). The presence of this term and its significance for\nsolving the local problem has been pointed out by a number of authors (see, for instance, Thorne\n& Hartle (1985); Kopejkin (1987)); however, to our knowledge, the interaction term has never\nbeen previously presented in a closed relativistic form.\nBy straightforward calculation, one may check that the obtained metric tensor gmn(y^) satisfies the Hilbert-Einstein field equations written in the coordinates of the proper RF^- To do\nthis, let us note that the covariant de Bonder gauge is singling out these coordinates according to\nconditions (C2). This gives the expressions for the Ricci tensor Rmn in the form of eqs.(C4). The\nmodified energy-momentum tensor Smn in this coordinate system is given by expressions (C12).\nBy collecting all these expressions together, one may obtain the linearized Hilbert-Einstein field\nequations, eq.(4.1), presented in the coordinates of the proper RF^- Finally, the substitution\nof the relations of eqs.(4.11) in the obtained linearized equations will complete the proof of the\ncorrespondence between the metric tensor gmn(y^) and the field equations.\nThus, metric (4.11) is the KLQ parameterized solution of the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational\nfield equations in the coordinates of the proper RF^. The nature of this result is basically the\npost-Newtonian boost of solution (4.8) (obtained in the inertia! RFo) to the new non-inertial\ncoordinate system defined in the vicinity of an arbitrary body (A). It is well known that the\nRiemann metric tensor gmn(y^) contains ten degrees of freedom and could not be transformed\nto the Minkowski tensor for the entire space-time by any choice of a coordinate transformation\nthat has only four degrees of freedom. This transformation could be done at one point of the\nspace-time only (Eisenhart, 1926) or along the geodesic line (Manasse & Misner, 1963; Misner et\nal., 1973; Landau & Lifshitz, 1988). Such an RF is called a quasi-inertial or \'locally Lorentzian\nframe.\' Our future discussion will be based on the form of the metric tensor in the proper RF/i\ngiven by relations (4.11). In the next section, we will implement the conditions for construction\nof a \'good\' quasi-Lorentzian proper RF as discussed in Section 2, which will enable us to find the\nunknown transformation functions KA, LA, and Q^.\n\n4.3 Decomposition of the Fields in the Proper RF.\nConcluding this section, we would like to emphasize that the solution to the Hilbert-Einstein\nfield equations gmn in the vicinity of the body\'s (A) world line in the coordinates (y^) of its\nproper RF^ in the first WFSMA may be decomposed into the following three major groups:\n(4.13)\n\nwhere the notations for these groups and their meaning are as presented below.\n(i) . The first term, 7^n, is the local inertial (or Riemann-flat) field that is presented by eqs.(B4).\nThis term is also convenient to split into two parts as shown by the relation\n\n59\n\nwhere jmn is the usual Minkowski metric in the coordinates of the proper RF^. The\nsecond term here, 7mn N> i 1S *^e KLQ-parameterized post-Newtonian contribution to this\nlocal inertial field at the vicinity of the body\'s (A) world line.\n(ii). The second term in eq.(4.13), H\xc2\xa3n, is the local gravitational field, which is given as follows:\n\n0(c-4),\n\n(4.15a)\n\nwhere the terms hmn are the components of the unperturbed proper gravitational field of\nthe body (A), the term hoo>f4> (given by eq.(4.9b)) is the contribution due to the boost of\nthis unperturbed field to the accelerated coordinates of the proper quasi-inertial RF^, and\nthe last term, /i^g<4> (which is presented by eq.(4.9c)), is caused by the interaction of the\nproper unperturbed gravitational field with the external gravitation. Thus, the component\nhas the form\n\n}}\nJ\xe2\x80\xa2 uA(ypA] -\n\n+4 Y, (u A (y p A )U B (y p A ) - JA ,f y \' A , v .p A (y%y\' A }U B (y^y\' A ]\\ + O(c~^\nj y\n(4.156)\nB*A V\n\\ A -y A \\\n)\nwhere the subscript (A) for the integral sign means that the integration is performed over\nthe volume of that body for which mass density is integrated, namely: fA d?y\'ApB =\n(m). The last term in eq. (4.13), H^n, is the external gravitational field, presented as follows:\n\n-0(<T 4 ),\n\n(4.16a)\n\nwhere the first two terms in the component HQQ are the result of the boost (see eq. (4.9d))\nto the coordinates (y^) of the RF^ of the unperturbed solutions h^\' for the bodies (B)\n60\n\nin the system (besides (A)); the third term, h^gg? (given by eq.(4.9e)), is due to the\nmutual gravitational interactions of these external bodies with each other; and, finally,\nthe last term is due to existing inhomogeneity of the background space-time in which the\nconsidered system is embedded. The component iir^<4>(j/^) may be given as follows:\n\nB\'^A\n\n(4.166)\nwhere the potential $25 (I/A) entering the term ^B(]/A) ^s defined as\n\n\'A) + 0(c-6).\n\nB\n\n(4.i6c)\n\nThe decomposition presented by eqs.(4.13)-(4.16) may be successfully continued to the next\n\'post-post-Newtonian\' order; however, the obtained accuracy is quite sufficient for most modern\nastronomical applications. The results obtained in this section will become a useful tool in the\nnext section for constructing a proper RF with well-defined physical properties.\n\n61\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\n5\n\nGeneral Relativity: Transformations to the Proper RF.\n\nIn this section, we will present the construction of a \'good\' proper RF for an arbitrary body (A).\nThis procedure should enable one to obtain the yet unknown transformation functions KA, LA,\nand Q^. It is clear that one may choose any form of these functions for the description of\nthe gravitational environment around the body under question. The analysis presented in the\nprevious section shows by the results in eqs.(4.12) that, in order to solve the local problem, it is\npermissible to separate the contributions in the metric tensor gmn(]/A) mto seyeral terms. The\nfirst contribution is due to the inertial sector of the local space-time, the second is produced\nby the body itself, the third term is caused by the external sources of the gravitational field,\nand the last one is due to the interaction of the body\'s multipole moments with this external\ngravitational field. It is well known that if the body (A) is a neutral monopole test particle, this\nexternal gravitational field will define the parameters of the geodesic line that this test body\nwill follow (Einstein et ai, 1938; Fock, 1957; Will, 1993). The equations of motion for spinning\nbodies are different from the latter by additional terms due to coupling of the body\'s spin to\nthe external gravitational field (Papapetrou, 1948, 1951). It was noted that the presence of nonvanishing internal multipole moments of extended bodies significantly changes their equations of\nmotion, and several attempts have made to account for these effects (see, for example, Ashby &\nBertotti, 1986; Shahid-Salees et al., 1991; Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a; DSX, 1991-94). In this\nreport, we will introduce a new approach based on the KLQ parameterization discussed in the\nprevious section.\nThe general idea for constructing the \'good\' RF^ in terms of the functions KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^ is\nto choose these functions in such a way that the corresponding Riemann-flat inertial space-time\nTmn (which is the background space-time for the proper RF^) will be tangent to the total metric\ntensor gmn in the vicinity of the world line of the body (A). These conditions, when applied to\ninertially moving test particles, are known as the Fermi conditions (Misner et al., 1973). We\nwould like to extend the applicability of these conditions to the case of a system of extended\nself-gravitating and arbitrarily shaped celestial bodies. To do this, let us recall that the relation\nfor the local gravitational field Smn (y^)> which is based on the decomposition eqs.(4.13), may\nbe given as follows:\n(5-1)\n\nThen the generalized Fermi conditions in the local region of body (A) (or in the immediate vicinity\nof its world-line 74) may be introduced by equations (3.26) as follows:\n(5-2a)\n\niA\n\n1\n\nlA\n\n\' IA\n\n|),\n\n(5.26)\n\nwhere the quantities Fmn (y^) are the Christoffel symbols calculated with respect to the local\ngravitational field pmn (l^) given by eq.(5.1). These relations summarize our expectations based\non the Equivalence Principle about the local gravitational environment of self-gravitating and\narbitrarily shaped extended bodies. These conditions enable us to separate the local gravitational\nfield from the external gravitation in the immediate vicinity of the body (A). This separation\nis possibly due to the remaining arbitrariness of the transformation functions KA,LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^.\nThe conditions of eqs.(5.2) will give the differential equations for these functions, the solutions of\nwhich will correspond to the specific choice of the background inertial space-time in the proper\n63\n\n- To obtain these equations, one should substitute the relations for the metric tensor in the\nform (4.11) in the expressions for the Christoffel symbols (.F2) and then make use of conditions\n(5.1).\n5.1\n5.1.1\n\nFinding the Functions KA and QA.\nEquations for the Functions KA and Q^.\n\nTo obtain the equation for the function KA, one should substitute into conditions (5.1) the\nrelation for the component r(j0(?/^) of the connection coefficients given by eq.(F2a). This will\ngive the following result:\n\nE\n\n(5.3)\n\nB+A\n\n7/1\n\nThe components r0Q(y^) and rg^y^), which are given by eqs.(F2b}and(F2d~), correspondingly,\nwill provide us with the following equation:\n\n= e?(c-4).\n\n(5.4)\n\nB+A\n\nFrom the components r^(y^) of the connection coefficients that are given by eq.(F2/), one may\nobtain the first equation for the function QA:\n\n\xc2\xa3\n(5.5)\nThe components rQy3(y^) of eq.(F2e) will give the second and last equation for the second\nunknown transformation function:\n\n(5.6)\n\n5.1.2\n\nThe Solution for the Function KA-\n\nIn order to find the solutions to the differential equations above, let us first denote the limiting\noperation from expressions (5.2) for any non-singular function f(ypA} as follows:\n\n= Jim\n|JM|-*O\n\n(5.7)\n\nIt is important to note that operation (5.7) commutes with the time derivative but not with the\nspatial derivative.\n\n64\n\nThen, using this new notation, we may formally integrate eq.(5.3) over time y^ as follows:\n\n(5.8)\nwhere \xc2\xa3M is an arbitrary function of the spatial coordinates yA. To continue the solution, let us\nrecall the relation for the function KA given by eq.((756) in the following form:\n\nwhere the subscript (TO]) denotes that the operation (5.7) was used to derive the result (5.9) for\nthe functions KA and VA^ \xe2\x80\xa2 One may notice that the dependence on the spatial coordinate in\nthis relation for KA disappears completely on a world line of the body, so the function CiA(y^)\nis a true constant, i.e., CIA(J/A) = CIA = const. Then, from these two relations, (5.8) and (5.9),\none may obtain the differential equation for the function P^(y^) as follows:\n\nIf we formally integrate this last equation over time y\\ and for the function KA, we will obtain\nthe following final solution:\n\n(5.11)\nEquation (5.4) provides us with the usual relation for the Newtonian acceleration a^\ncenter of inertia of a body (A) as follows:\n\nof the\n\nThus, we have obtained the form of the first transformation function KA, eq.(5.11), which\ndescribes the Newtonian corrections to the proper time yQA. These corrections should be made in\norder to take into account the external gravitational field and the Lorentzian time contraction\ncaused by the motion of the origin of the proper RF^ with the velocity VA relative to the\ninertial barycentric RFo- This correction was first obtained by D\'Eath (1975a,b) by the method\nof matched asymptotic expansions while studying the motion of black holes. In astronomical\napplications for the relativistic VLBI measurements, this effect was independently obtained and\nstudied by Hellings (1986). The only new term in the expression in eq.(5.11) is the constant\nCj4, which is the free parameter entering the post-Poincare group of motion. This parameter\nrepresents the possibility of the time shift in proper RF^ and is responsible for the energy\nconservation in the immediate vicinity of the massive test particle moving along the geodesic.\nThe acceleration, eq.(5.12), is the contribution of the monopole into the equation of motion of\nthe extended body. The contributions of the other multipoles to the results in (5.11) and (5.12)\nwill be obtained and discussed further.\n\n65\n\n5.1.3\n\nThe Solution for the Function\n\nThe solution for the function Q\\ requires slightly more sophisticated calculations. One may\nexpect that the function Q\\ behaves at least quadratically while approaching to the origin of\nthe body\'s world line (i.e., QA ~ y^y" \xe2\x80\xa2 f(y A ], where f(y\xc2\xb0A] is some time-dependent function).\nLet us look at the solution to the equation (5.5) for the function Q\xc2\xb0^ in the following form:\n\nJ\nwhere Ci and 02 are the constants, unknown for the moment. The function ^i^(y%y A ) behaves\nlinearly in the vicinity of the body\'s world line: ^(y^,^) ~ 2/M \xe2\x80\xa2 /(?/A)- By substituting the.\nexpression of eq.(5.13) into equation (5.5), we will find that these constants are c\\ = 1 and\nC2 = \xe2\x80\x941/2 and that the function \xc2\xa32^ should satisfy the equation\n(5.14)\nBy making use of these results, we may write the solution to eq.(5.5) as follows:\n\nBjtA\n\nFurther calculations require somewhat more sophisticated approach. After some algebra, eq.(5.6)\nmight be rewritten as follows:\n\n(5.16)\nB+A\n\nBy integrating equation (5.16) over time y\xc2\xb0A, we obtain\n\n= cr\n\n+7o\n\n= const.\n\n(5.17)\n\nThen the function fi^t from eq.(5.15) may be represented in the following form:\n(5.18)\n\nfl,lfi) = - E yA\n\nwhere F% is some unknown function. By substituting the expression of eq.(5.18) into eq.(5.17),\nwe will define the function Q as follows:\n\n66\n\n- - E W \xe2\x80\xa2 <f }\xe2\x80\x9e- r\n+\n\n-5\xc2\xbbV"m\xc2\xbb\'\xc2\xbb5 ^t\xc2\xbbS,yS),\nwith t h e condition o n t h e function\n\n(5.W)\n\nF:\ndypA\n\nFrom the expressions of eqs.(5.6),(5.18), and (5.20), one may write the equation for the function\nF% in the vicinity of the body\'s (A) world line as\n\n+2 \xc2\xa3 [(ff\xc2\xbbVBfl)o - (W)J.\n\n(5.21)\n\nThis last equation, eq.(5.21), may be solved together with eq.(5.20) as follows:\n\ni fOt\n\xc2\xbb A-fj\n\nft\n"A\n\nI\n\nOL (\n[Ol\n\n0 \\\n-A/\'\n\n(c OO^\n\\ "\n/\n\nwhere the constants cr^ and /A are connected as faB + faa = aa/3- r^^ie tim6-dependent function\n\xe2\x80\xa2A] is unknown at the moment.\nW\nFinally, by collecting the obtained relations from eqs.(5.19) and (5.22), we will obtain the\nfinal solution for the second transformation function, Q^, as follows:\n\nJ+\n\nI 3 )-\n\n(5.23)\n\nThus, we have obtained the second transformation function, Q^, which is the first function to describe the post-Newtonian coordinate transformation to the proper RF of a moving\nmassive monopole body. The only function that is still unknown in expression (5.23) is the\nfunction w% , which defines the post-Newtonian correction to the radius vector y% . This\ntime-dependent function will be obtained later. Besides the usual Lorentzian terms of the\nlength contraction (caused by the velocity of motion of the coordinate origin), the expression\nabove contains terms caused purely by gravity. The first two terms are due to the acceleration\n\n67\n\nof the proper RF^ caused by the external gravitational field. The third term is the length contraction caused by the external gravitational field. The fourth term with the integral sign is the\ngeneralization of the expression for geodesic and Thomas precession of the coordinate axis (see\nThomas, 1927). A similar expression was obtained by D\'Eath (1975a,b). In astronomical practice, this result was introduced by Brumberg &: Kopejkin (1988) (see also Ries et al, 1991; DSX,\n1991). The obtained relation is different from the previous results in that it contains a generalized representation of the term containing the precessions. In particular, the obtained relation is\ndefined explicitly and does not contain an arbitrary multiplier q as in the Brumberg-Kopejkin\nmethod. This suggests that the precession term should always be present in the expressions\nfor the coordinate transformations and neglecting this term will correspond to the RF, which\nis deviating from the geodesic world line even for the massless test particles, and will lead to\nthe SEP violation. In addition to this, expression (5.23) has an arbitrary group parameter f A g .\nThis parameter represents the angular momentum conservation law at the immediate vicinity of\nthe world line of the body (A) in its proper RF^. Besides this, we have studied separately the\npost-Newtonian part of the radius vector of the body (A), WA , which was never done before.\nThe contributions of the other multipoles to the result in (5.23) will be obtained and discussed\nin the next section in a manner similar to the case of the function KA, (5.11), and the Newtonian\neq.m., (5.12),.\n\n5.2 Finding the Function LA.\nIn this subsection, we will consider the problem of finding the function LA, which is the last\nunknown function for transformations (3.5). This function corresponds to the post-Newtonian\ncorrection to the transformation of barycentric time to time in the proper RF. As we shall see,\nthis function will depend on the model of matter distribution taken to describe the internal\nstructure of the bodies in the system. In contrast to the functions KA and Q^, the analog of\nthe function LA has never previously been obtained, which makes the results here particularly\ninteresting.\n\n5.2.1\n\nEquations for the Function LA-\n\nThe relations in (F2) and conditions in eqs.(5.1) enable us to obtain the equations for the function\nLA- Thus, from the components r\xc2\xb0j3(y^), which are given by eq.(F2c), we will have the first\nequation for this function as follows:\n\n-j(LA(y 0 A,y\xc2\xbb A )\n+ E\n\n(5.24)\nThe second necessary equation may be obtained from the expression for the components F\neq.(F2b), by simply making use of the solution for the function KA given by eq.(5.11) and the\nresult of the acceleration of the center of mass eq.(5.12). This equation has the following form:\n\n68\n\n(5.25)\nwhere the function HQQ > is given by eq.(4.166). From the relations for the components TQO\neq.(F2d), and with the help of the expressions in eqs.(S.ll), (5.12), (5.17), and eq.(5.24), one\nmay obtain\n9 f ni d\n\n(5.26)\n\n+4\n\nThis last equation may be formally integrated over time as follows:\n^ d\n\nBjtA\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(5.27)\n\nwhere we have separated the integrating constant a^. Using the relations for the components\nFo0(y^), eq.(F2a), and the solutions (5.11),(5.12), and (5.27), one may obtain the last equation\nfor the function LA as given below:\n\n(5.28)\n\n69\n\nThus, we have obtained four equations necessary to determine the last unknown transformation function LA, namely, eqs.(5.24)-(5.26) and (5.28).\n5.2.2\n\nThe Solution for the Function LA-\n\nThe determination of functions KA and Q\xc2\xb0^ helps us find the solution for the function LA as\nwell. In order to do this, let us look for the function LA in the following form:\n\nThen from eq.(5.24), one may easily obtain the unknown constants fci, fo, o,ndk^ and the condition\non the function B^ as follows:\nki = 2\'\n\n^2 = -2,\n\n\xc2\xa33 = 1;\n\n0.\n\n(5.30)\n\nThe unknown function Bf may be determined from eq.(5.27) by making use of the expressions\nof eqs.(5.11),(5.23), and (5.24). Thus, the intermediate solution for the function LA may be\npresented as follows:\n\nB^A\n\nE\n\n\'\nh B^(y^),\n\n(5.31)\n\nwhere a A is a constant, and the unknown time-dependent function B\xc2\xa3 may be obtained from\neq.(5.28). In order to do this, let us first integrate eq.(5.28) over time y\xc2\xb0A:\n\n70\n\nA\n\n4TA\n\n+\n\ntf + 0(c ~ 7 >-\n\n<5\'32)\n\nThen, the function B\xc2\xa3 may be determined from equation (5.32) with the help of eqs.(5.11),\n(5.23), and (5.31) in the following form:\n\n-\n\nE (*\n\n-\n\nE\n+\n\no"\n\nM\n\n(0] -\n\n(5-33)\n\nFinally, by collecting the results in obtained eqs.(5.31) and (5.33) together, we get the following\nexpression for the transformation function LA in the coordinates (j/^) of quasi-inertial\n\n0\n\nB^A\n\n-4\n\nCM+\n\n(5-34)\n71\n\nThus, we have obtained the last function, LA, for the post-Newtonian transformation in the\nWFSMA. Notice that this function is the only one that depends on the model of matter chosen\nfor description of the bodies in the system through the term H(JQ<4>. This function contains\ntwo new parameters of the group of motion, namely: the parameter \xc2\xa3A, which is the extension\nof the Newtonian parameter \xc2\xa3A on the post-Newtonian order, and the parameter a^, which\nrepresents the time-dependent Poincare rotation. The function LA demonstrates the non-linear\ncharacter of the obtained group of motion. This non-linearity is due to the interaction of the\nproper gravitational field of the body (A) with the external gravitation. Thus, the Newtonian\npotential UA and its gradients influence the dynamic of the proper RF^ in the case when some\nof the parameters from the ten parametric group (\xc2\xa3A, (,A\\ aA; fA) are not zero.\nIt is worth noting that some parts of the expression (5.34) were obtained by D\'Eath (1975a,b),\nwhose method has been used in the Brumberg-Kopejkin formalism (Brumberg &: Kopejkin,\n1988a,b). However, this is the first time the function LA has been obtained in the form of the\nexpression above. This function describes the post-Newtonian corrections to the proper time and,\nbesides the usual Lorentzian contributions, it contains the purely gravitational terms caused by\nthe external gravitational field. The only unknown function in this expression is the function\nWA , which will be discussed in the following subsection. Let us mention that knowledge of the\nfunction LA will be required for analyzing the results of the proposed post-Newtonian redshift\nexperiment planned for the Solar Probe mission (Anderson, 1989). This effect on the necessary\naccuracy was studied by Krisher (1993), who had formulated the frequency shift of the spacecraft\nclock to the order of c~ 4 . However, his formulation appears to be very simplified and does not\ninclude the dynamical effects due to proper accelerated motion of the spacecraft in close proximity\nto the Sun, which is the crucial phase of the experiment. We believe that the correct derivation\nof the corresponding effect should be based upon the relativistic theory of the astronomical RFs,\nso that the function LA, (5.34), will provide one with all the required corrections, including both\nkinematical and dynamical effects. Moreover, in Section 7, we will obtain the parameterized form\nof this function which will enable one to include in the analysis alternative tensor-scalar theories\nof gravity.\n\n5.3\n\nEquations of Motion for the Massive Bodies.\n\nBy finding the form of the function LA, we determined almost all of the functions for the coordinate transformation between RFs. However, one quantity still remains unspecified: the function\nWA in expressions (5.23) and (5.34). This function might be obtained from the last unused\nequation, namely eq.(5.25). By substituting the relations obtained for functions KAandQ\'A given\nby eqs.(5.11) and (5.23) into eq.(5.25), and making use of the expression for the function LA\ngiven by eqs.(5.34), one obtains the following ordinary differential equation for the last unknown\nfunction w^, ,:\n\n).\n\n72\n\n(5.35)\n\nWe may check that this equation is the post-Newtonian part of the acceleration A\xc2\xb0^ of the center\nof the field of the body (A) with respect to the barycenter written in its proper coordinate system.\nIf we perform the coordinate transformation from the coordinates (y^) of the proper RF^ to those\n(xp] of the inertial barycentric RFo of all the functions and potentials entering in eq.(5.35), we\nobtain the well-known geodesic equation for the test body written in coordinates (xp) of the\nbarycentric inertial RFo- To do this, let us first combine the two parts of the acceleration A^\nas follows:\nJ\\.\n\nA\n\n[0]\n\nI l7 A I\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2"\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\xe2\x80\x94\n\nQf A\n\n( \\1 A I\n\n[0] \xc2\xbb<^-**-\'\n\n~\\~ ItJ\n\nA\n\nI I/\n\nA )\n\n[0] ^^ **\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\n~T~ \\J\n\nI \xc2\xa3\n\nv\n\n/ *\n\n/\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n( 0 \xc2\xabOO )\n\n\\\n\n/\n\nwhere the terms in this equation are given by relations (5.12) and (5.35). Then, by using the\ntransformation rules from Appendix E, we may obtain the following result for acceleration A^\ntransformed into the coordinates of the inertial barycentric\n-,,^\n\n\xc2\xabJ -4 \xc2\xa3 UB,(x*>))B\'^A\n\nB+A\n\n+ 0(c-6),\n\n(5.37)\n\n"/A\n\nwhere the quantities in the right-hand side of this expression are taken at the world line of the\ntest body (A). Equation (5.37) is the usual form of the geodesic equation (Will, 1993; Brumberg,\n1991) in the coordinates of an inertial RFo. This result proves the previous conclusion that\nrelation (5.35) is also the geodesic equation, simply written in the coordinates of the proper\nquasi-inertial\n\n5.4\n\nThe Proper RF of the Small Self-Gravitating Body.\n\nIn this subsection, we will discuss the transformation functions for the massive rotating test\nbody with the small proper dimensions obtained in the previous parts of this section. In order to\ndo this, let us note that the generalized Fermi conditions, eqs.(5.2), involve the first derivatives\nfrom the metric tensor, which gave us the differential equations of the second order on the\ntransformation functions KA-, LA, and Q%. The expected form of the post-Newtonian expansions\nof the metric tensor in the proper RF^, which resulted in condition (B3a), enabled us (with the\nhelp of conditions (5.2)) to obtain the complete solution for the function KA- However, the\nfunctions L and Qa were only defined up to the second order with respect to the spatial point\nseparation, namely: LA,Q\xc2\xb0A ~ ^(Iy2l 3 )- This means that the arbitrariness due to the highest\norders of the spatial point separation caused by the multipoles of higher orders than quadrupole\n(k > 3) should be included in the expressions for these functions. Taking these notes into account,\nwe should include in the final expressions for these functions the higher-order terms with respect\nto the spatial point separation. Then, the solutions for these functions, presented by relations\n(5.23) and (5.34), respectively, should be extended as follows:\n\nQaA[0] (y% yl} = Q a[0]0 (ifl, tfi) + \xc2\xa3 <Kw (i&) \xe2\x80\xa2 y + <?(lrf+ :),\nA\n0\n73\n\n(5.38)\n\nLA[O] (y\xc2\xb0A, y"A] = LA[0] (y% ft) + \xc2\xa3 LA{L}(y\xc2\xb0A) . yjf > + O(|^|fc+1).\n\n(5.39)\n\nl>3\n\nAs a result, the post-Newtonian dynamically non-rotating coordinate transformations from\nthe coordinates of barycentrical inertial RFo to those of the proper quasi-inertial RF^ will take\nthe following form:\n*\xc2\xb0 = y\xc2\xb0A + c-2KA[0] (y\xc2\xb0A, y*A] + c-4LA[0] (y\xc2\xb0A , y\\) + O(C-6)y\xc2\xb0A,\nx" = VA + y\\0] (ifi) + c-2QaAlo] (y% V\xc2\xa3A) + O(c-^y%\nThe transformation functions K A ,Q^ and LA are given as follows:\nK A0 (& VA) =\n\nt\' E\n\nVB ~ V A\n\nO\n\nV\n\nO\n\n+ tf - V AO \xe2\x80\xa2 f A + O(c^}y^\n\n(5.40a)\n(5.406)\n\n(5.41a)\n\n(5.414)\n\nE\n\n(5.41c)\n74\n\nwith the equations for both time-dependent functions yA (j/^) and WA (yQA] denned by equations\n(5.12) and (5.35), respectively.\nAt this point, we are ready to present the general form of the metric tensor in the proper\nUFA defined with the generalized Fermi conditions. Thus, by substituting the solutions obtained\nfor the functions KA-, LA, and Q^ into the general form of the metric tensor gmnti/A) in a proper\ngiven by the relations in eqs.(4.11), we will obtain this tensor in the following form:\n\ndUB\n\nk\n\n\'E\n1>Z\n\n(5.42o)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Q0A{L}(y\xc2\xb0A}}\n\n) \xe2\x80\xa2 y{AL}+\n\nJ>\n\nwhere the subscript (A) for the components of the metric tensor specifies that this tensor was obtained by making use of the specifically denned transformation functions (5.41). The expressions\nfor the functions WA and Wg were obtained by substituting the solutions for the transformation\n\n75\n\nfunctions into the relations for #oo<4> and HJQ<4> given by eqs.(4.14) and (4.16), correspondingly. These functions have the following form:\n\n[0]\n\n+2 \xc2\xa3 (uA(ypA)UB(ypA} - I\nB^A\n\nJA\n\nd3y\'\'*PA(y\xc2\xb0\nyA\n\xe2\x84\xa2A ~ y A \\\n\nA ,y\'Z)U B (y%y\'X))\n\n\'\n\n(5.43o)\n\ny\'A\n\n{L} _\n\ni{L}\n\n(5.436)\n\nExpressions (5.42) are the general solution for the field equations of the general theory of\nrelativity, which satisfies the generalized Fermi conditions, eqs.(5.2), in the immediate vicinity of\nbody (A). This solution reflects the geometrical features of the proper RP^ with respect to the\nspecial properties of the motion of the kth multipoles of the unknown functions\nfor I > 3, which will be discussed further.\nThe transformation functions in eq.(5.41) correspond to non-rotating coordinate transformations between different RFs in the WFSMA. They were obtained by applying the generalized Fermi\nconditions in eqs.(5.2). The set of the resulting formulae, eqs.(5.41) together with eqs.(5.12) and\n(5.35), represents the generalization of the Poincare group of motion to the problem of practical\ncelestial mechanics. The arbitrary constants \xc2\xa3A = c~\'2^A + c~4^A, cr^, and /^ correspond to the\nmaximal number of Killing vectors (M = 10) in the background pseudo-Euclidean space-time,\nand the expressions (5.40)-(5.41) represent the ten-parameter group of motion constructed for\nthe dynamic of the celestial bodies in the WFSMA. The non-zero parameters describe the shift\nof the origin of the coordinate system, the constant spatial rotation of the axes, and the relativistic Poincare rotation. These parameters represent the offset of the origin of the coordinate\nsystem from the center of the field of the body under consideration, which may vary from body\nto body. Moreover, these parameters lead to the appearance of the proper gravitational potential\n\n76\n\nUA and its gradients d a UA in the function LA (5 Ale). A contribution of this sort could be a\nuseful tool for some practical applications of the atomic time comparison (Brumberg, 1991a).\nThis dependence indicates the fact that the constant part of the proper gravity of the body\n(A) is also affecting the definition of its world line. This contribution may be neglected if one\nwill choose these constants in such a way that this influence of the proper field will vanish. In\naddition, let us mention that the component of the metric tensor ^Jo also becomes dependent\non these quantities describing the proper gravitational field, which violates the conditions on\nthe metric tensor and the coordinate transformations to the proper RF^ given in Section 1.\nTherefore, without losing a generality, in our future calculations, we will eliminate this offset and\nwill set all of these parameters to be zero:\nCA = c-2tf + c-4tf = o% = ff = 0.\n\n(5-44)\n\nIn order to find the unknown functions Q^tj\\(y^) and LA{L}(I/A} UP to *ne kth (k ^ 3) order,\none should use the conditions that will contain the spatial derivatives from the metric tensor of\nthe (k \xe2\x80\x94 1) order. Moreover, one expects to obtain the recurrent formulae that would connect\nthe features of transformation of an arbitrary kth term with those for the previous (k \xe2\x80\x94 1) terms.\nThus, following Synge (1960), one may want to apply some non-local geometrical constructions,\nsuch as Jacobi equations (Manasse & Misner, 1963) or both Jacobi equations and the FermiWalker transport (Li & Ni, 1979a,b). However, these constraints generally are not related to the\nparticular theory under consideration, so their application should be justified for the particular\ntheory of gravity under question. Another method is to use the \'external\' multipole moments\nas they were defined for the gravitational wave theory by Thorne (1980) or Blanchet & Damour\n(1986, 1989). Indeed, one could show that the functions Q^{I/}(y^) and LA^VA) in the WFSMA\nmay be chosen in such a way that the metric tensor in a proper RFyi, eqs.(4.11), corresponding\nto this choice will accept the desired form. The presentation of the transformation functions in\nterms of the \'external\' multipole moments simply corresponds to the specific RF for which KLQ\ndynamical parameterization is strictly defined by this choice.\n\n5.5 The Fermi- Normal-Like Coordinates.\nAs we noticed above, in order to determine the metric up to the kth multipole contribution, one\nshould apply some additional conditions that enable us to define the specific properties of the\nreference frame with which we will be dealing. For example, we might obtain these functions for\nthe case of the motion of the monopole test particle up to the second order of a spatial point\nseparation. Assuming the motion of that particle is described by the geodesic equation and the\ndeviation of geodesies is governed by the Jacobi equation, we might easily obtain the metric\ntensor in the generalized Fermi normal coordinates (Misner and Manasse, 1963; Li &; Ni, 1979;\nDolgov, Khriplovich 1983; Ashby &; Bertotti, 1986; Marzlin, 1994) up to the second order of the\nspatial separation and present it as follows:\n,\n\n(5.45a)\n\n(5.456)\n\n77\n\nare\n\nwhere /\n\n*^e components of the Riemann tensor, eqs.(G9), which is calculated with\n\nrespect to the external gravitational field H^n and taken on the world line *yA of the body (A)\nunder consideration.\nLet us mention that if the proper gravitational field may be neglected and the effects due\nto acceleration of the proper RF.4 are also negligible, the obtained metric tensor (5.45) will\ncorrespond to that of, so-called, Fermi normal coordinates constructed in the immediate vicinity\nof the world line of an inertial observer (Misner et al, 1973). However, for the general case of\nnon-vanishing contributions of the proper gravitational field and accelerated barycentric motion,\nthe form of the metric tensor, g^n (5.45), and the corresponding proper RF is what will be\nreferred to as the Fermi-normal-like coordinates. From these expressions for the metric tensor\ng^n, one may see that, in order to obtain this form of the metric tensor, it is necessary to perform\nthe coordinate transformation that should contain the terms with the third order of the spatial\npoint separation (Li &; Ni, 1979a,b; Zhang, 1985, 1986). We will obtain the necessary equations\non these functions by making use of the components of the Riemann tensor Rmnkid/^ expanded\nwith respect to the spatial separation from the world line of the body (A) and then equating the\'\ncoefficients proportional to ~ y A y A Thus, the components of the Riemann tensor calculated with respect to the external gravitational field Hmn from the relations in eqs.(G9) might be presented on a world line of the body\n(A) as follows:\n\n<L\\/ 9 U B -\\ -\n\n(5 466)\n\n-\n\nTo find the necessary corrections of the third order of the transformation functions Q% and\nLA, let us look in the following form:\n\n/\n\nO^A\n\nCi \xe2\x80\xa2 \'y\n\nyfyAiiDA \' ( ~r\\\n\no\n\nQy^A y\xc2\xb0A\n\n/\n\n~l~ P2 \xc2\xb0 yAaA^A \' (\n\nJI\n\n5T /\n\n\\dy A dy A \'Qj\n\n78\n\n~^~ ^(l^/Al )\'\n\n(5.47fl)\n\nM = Z, [\xc2\xab.\n-VAttg \' ^Ql|0](rf,^) + 0(l\xc2\xbbil"),\n\n(5.476)\n\nwhere the constants ci,C2 and 91,92 are unknown at the moment.\nThe expressions for the components of the metric tensor g^n. eqs.(5.45), and those for the\nRiemann tensor, eqs.(5.46), will enable us to obtain the equations for the determination of the\nconstants Ci,C2 and 91,92- Thus, from the component g\xc2\xa3g, eq.(5.45c), and the relation for the\n> eq-(5.46c), we will have\n\n2ci + l = -,\n\n2(ci + c2) = --,\n\n2c2 = -,\n\nwhich will give the following values for these constants:\nci = \xe2\x84\xa2,\n\nc2 = -.\n\nO\n\n(5.48)\n\n0\n\nAnalogously, from the component c^, eq.(5.45&); the relation for (R^u,acr} , eq.(5.466); and\n\\ ^ /o\nthe solution for function SV3Q%M given by eq.(5.46a), with the obtained c\\ and 02, eq.(5.47), we\n"10]\n\xc2\xb0btain\n\n2 Q l - l = -24\n\n292 = -^;\no\n\nl\nqi +\n\n- = 2-\n\n4\n92 +n 2=-\n\nO\n\n=> 9i = l\n=>\n\n2\n92 = --.\n\n,r An.\n(5.49)\n\no\n\nTaking these results into account, the corrections up to the third order with respect to the\nspatial point separation to the solutions for QaA and LA., presented by eqs.(5.47), will take the\nfollowing form:\n\n\xc2\xb0A, yA) = - :\n\n-4 \'\n\n,^\n- 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 tfri -\n\n+\n\n0(\\y^.\n\n(5.506)\n\nBy substituting these solutions into the expressions of eqs.(5.42), one might get the metric tensor\nin a proper RP^ of the moving extended body (A) with accuracy up to the second order of the\nspatial point separation. Thus, assuming that all the integration constants satisfy eq.(5.44), one\nmay get the following form of the metric tensor in the generalized Fermi normal coordinates:\n\n79\n\n2WA(ypA)+\n\n,\n(5.51o)\n\n> J+\n(5.516)\n\nThus we have obtained the form of the metric tensor in Fermi-normal-like coordinates and the\ncoordinate transformation, which leads to this form as well. These transformations are defined\nup to the third order with respect to the spatial point separation.\nA more detailed analysis of the coordinate transformation for the extended self-gravitating\nbodies will be performed in the next section.\n\n80\n\n6\n\nGeneral Relativity: The Proper RF for the Extended Body.\n\nIn this section, we will generalize the results obtained for the relativistic coordinate transformations (5.40) and will extend their applicability to the problem of motion of a system of\nN extended bodies in the WFSMA. The relations (5.40) were obtained by using the generalized\nFermi conditions (3.26) and, hence, they are well suited to describe the motion of the system of\nN self-gravitating bodies, omitting only the lowest intrinsic multipole moments. To generalize\nthese results in the case of arbitrarily shaped extended bodies, we must use the more general\ndefinition of the proper RF given by expressions (3.29). This definition is based on the study\nof the existence of integral conservation laws for metric theories of gravity, (3.28). The studies\nof the existence of the conservation laws in general relativity were performed by a number of\nscientists, notably by Fock (1955) and Chandrasekhar (1965), whose methods were developed\nin application to the motion of the more general N-body systems in the framework of the PPN\nformalism (Lee et al, 1974; Denisov & Turyshev, 1989; Will, 1993). It should be noted that the\nsearch for the conservation laws in these methods was performed in the barycentric inertia! RFo\nand, in particular, it was shown that general relativity in the WFSMA has all ten conservation\nlaws for the closed system of fields corresponding to energy of the system, its momentum, and\nangular momentum. The difference of the present research from that cited above is in the fact\nthat we will study the problem of existence of the integral conservation laws in an accelerated\narbitrary KLQ-parameterized proper RFyi. As a result of our study, we should find the conditions necessary to impose on the transformation functions KA,LA, and Q^L, so that the general\nrelativity in the coordinates of this RF will preserve the existent conservation laws for the entire\nsystem under consideration.\n\n6.1 The Extended-Body Generalization.\nIt is well known that in all metric theories of gravity the Lagrangian density of matter is the same\nfunctional of metric of Riemann space-time gmn and the other fields of matter if} A- Then the\napplication of the method of infinitesimal displacements (Bogolyubov &; Shirkov, 1984; Logunov,\n1987) to the action function of matter in these theories, together with the condition that the\neq.m. for the fields t/U are satisfied, leads to the same covariant equation for the conservation of\ndensity of the energy-momentum tensor of matter in Riemann space- time:\nVfcf\xe2\x84\xa2* = dkTmk + T%Tlp = 0.\n\n(6.1)\n\nNote that this result is independent of the choice of RF. In the case of a system of bodies formed\nfrom an ideal fluid with the individual density of energy-momentum tensor Tg"1 of an arbitrary\nbody (B), which is given in the coordinates of its proper RFs by the expression (2.1) as\n(6.2o)\nthe total density of the energy-momentum tensor of the system of N bodies in the coordinates\nof the proper RF^ of a particular body (A) may then be composed as follows:\n\n(6.26)\nwhere Jg is the Jacobian of the corresponding coordinate transformation:\n\n\'firi\n81\n\n(6.2c)\n\nIn addition, from equation (6.1) for an ideal fluid model, (6.2), we may also obtain a covariant\nequation of continuity in the coordinates (y^) as follows:\n\n,\n\n(a,)\n\nwhere V^ is the covariant derivative with respect to metric tensor g\xc2\xa3n of the proper RF^. The\ntotal conserved mass density of the entire system in coordinates (ify is denoted as\n,\nB\n\ndy\n\nB\n\n(6-4)\n\nA\n\nwhere PB is the conserved mass density of the body (B) and all the quantities on the righthand side of this expression are transformed to the coordinates (3^) using the standard rules\nof relativistic transformations of the mechanics of Poincare (Fock, 1955). Equations (6.1) and\n(6.3) together with the metric tensor give all the expressions necessary for the construction of\nthe eq.m. of the extended bodies composed from ideal fluid and for analysis of various general\nquestions.\nIn order to generalize the results obtained in the previous section, in the case of arbitrarily\ncomposed extended bodies, we shall first construct the components of the density of the energymomentum tensor of matter Tmn to the required accuracy. Thus, from the definition in (6.2),\none may get these components in the Newtonian approximation as follows:\n(6.5a)\n(6.56)\n\n.\n\n(6.5c)\n\nAs a result, the covariant conservation equation (6.1) for m = a transforms into the Euler\nequation for an ideal fluid, while for m = 0 it transforms into the equation for the internal energy\nII of the local fields in the vicinity of the body (A):\nJ.a\n\n,\n5\n\n),\n\n(6.6a)\n\n(6.66)\n\nwhere the total time derivative with respect to the proper time y\xc2\xb0A is given by the usual relation:\nd/dy^ = d/dy\xc2\xb0A + v^d/dy1^. The total Newtonian potential of the system in these coordinates\nwas denoted as\nIn order to apply the conditions (3.29), one must substitute the expression for the total\nNewtonian potential U into (6.6a) and integrate this equation over the body (A)\'s compact\nvolume. However, if we do so for the potential from the solution in (5.42), the conditions in\n\n82\n\n(3.29) will not be satisfied. Indeed, the total Newtonian potential C/[0] may be identified as the\nterms of order c~2 in expression (5.42a) for the 500 component of the metric tensor as follows:\n\nu[0] =\n\nB\n\nIf one substitutes this potential into equation (6.6a) and integrates the resultant expression over\nthe body (A)\'s compact volume, one obtains\n\n- --r E\nBy expanding the integrand in the expression above in the Taylor series with respect to the\nspatial deviation from the supporting world line 7,4 (which is given as A^ ~ yA/\\yBA 0 \\), one may\nbring this result to the following form:\n\nB^AI>1\n\nIt is easy to see that this result does not satisfy the requirement for the \'good\' proper RF even\nin the Newtonian order. The origin of the RF, defined this way, coincides with the center of\ninertia of the local fields in the vicinity of the body under question in one particular moment\nof time only and will drift away from it as time progresses. Exactly the same situation was\nencountered with the solutions in both the Brumberg-Kopejkin (Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a,b)\nand the Damour-Soffel-Xu (DSX, 1991-1994; Damour &; Vokrouhlicky, 1995) formalisms. In\nboth of these methods, the translational motion of extended bodies in their proper RFs does not\nvanish in the Newtonian limit, but rather non-linearly depends on the coupling of the intrinsic\nmultipole moments with the external gravitational field. To solve this problem, the authors\nof both formalisms have introduced \'external\' multipole moments in order to compensate for\nthe terms on the right-hand side of expression (6.8b). However, this substitution may not be\nconsidered as a satisfactory solution to this problem. The reason for this is that the authors\nin both approaches were trying to describe the motion of extended bodies using methods that\nwere developed to treat the motion of point-like test bodies. As we already know, to overcome\nthis problem, we should develop a microscopic treatment of the matter, the gravitational field,\nand the field of inertia in the immediate vicinity of the bodies (i.e., in their local region) in the\nsystem.\nIn our method, the only step we have to make in order to the take into account the extent of\nthe bodies is to change the limiting procedure {..)0 defined by expression (5.7) to an averaging\nover the bodies\' volumes.13 We define this new procedure {..)A, which, being applied to any\nfunction f(y^), will denote an averaging of this function over the body (A)\'s three-dimensional\ncompact volume in accord with the following formula:\n(6.9a)\nmA=\n\ndVA$0(s#) + 0(c-4),\n\n13\n\n(6.9fr)\n\nNote that this situation is similar to that from the electrodynamics of continuous media, where one has to\naverage the field over the body\'s volume (Landau & Lifehitz, 1987).\n\n83\n\nwhere fl\xc2\xb0(y\'A) is the component of the conserved density of the energy-momentum tensor of\nmatter, inertia, and gravitational field in the local region of the body (A) taken jointly. It is easy\nto see that in the case of a system of N massive particles with the total mass density taken to be\np(y^) = ^B rn B^(y%yA + yBAo), this new procedure coincides with the procedure {..)0 defined\nby the expression in eq.(5.7). Note that the new operation (..}A given by eq.(6.9), contrary to\nthat of eq.(5.7), does not commutate with the operation of time differentiation.\nBecause of this change, the total gravitational potential U(yA}, which in the vicinity of the\nbody (A) is composed from the local Newtonian potential generated by the body (A) itself and\nthe tidal gravitational potential produced by external sources of gravity, will now have the form\n\n- E [ y A ( j - ) + (UB)A}+o(c-*).\n\nB\n\n(6.10)\n\nOne may make sure that expression (6.10) is what we need in order to have the origin of the\nproper RFA coincide with the local center of inertia. Indeed, by substituting this result for the\ntotal Newtonian potential U into equation (6.6a) and integrating the resultant expression over the\nbody (A)\'s compact volume, one finds that m^Q = 0(c~4). Thus, the center of inertia of the local\nfields, defined as the dipole moment of the fields in the immediate vicinity of the body (A), moves\nalong a straight line as given by the formula "i^o(y^) = A a +B a y\' A +O(c~ 4 ), where AaandBa are\nconstants. One may perform an additional infinitesimal post-Galilean transformation (similar to\nthat of (1.12)) in order to make them vanish: Aa = Ba = 0. This means that the origin of the\nproper EFA will coincide with the center of inertia of the local fields and, hence, the constructed\nframe will satisfy the definition of a \'good\' proper RF discussed in Section 3.\nAs a result, the general form of the coordinate transformations between the coordinates (xp)\nof RFo and those (y^) of a proper quasi-inertial RF^ of an arbitrary body (A) for the problem\nof motion of the N-extended-body system in the WFSMA may be presented as follows:\n\nwhere the barycentric radius vector r^Q of the body (A) in the coordinates of the proper RF^ is\ndecomposed into Newtonian and post-Newtonian parts, which are given as follows:\n/e\\ , /-^\\f \xe2\x80\x944\\\n\nIA) ~T~ ^(c\n\n)\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nfa i n\\\n\nv.O-l\'S)\n\nThe transformation functions KA, Q^, and LA, in this case will take the following form:\n(6.13o)\n\n= - E (vZA \xe2\x80\xa2 (d0u*)A ~ y^yA(dauB)A + yaA(uB) J+\n\nJ)-\n\nB^A\nk\n\nA} + E^A{L}(?/A) \xe2\x80\xa2 V ( A } + #(l^l fc+1 ) + O(c~^y%\n1=3\n\n84\n\n(6-136)\n\n>\nE\n\n+ ^(c-6)-\n\n(6.13c)\n\nOne may verify that in the case of the free-falling massive test particle with conserved mass\ndensity given as /^(y^) = m^^y^), functions (6.13) will correspond to the coordinate transformations to the proper RF defined on the geodesic world line. (5.41).\nNote that we have changed the notation /A[O\\ to /AO in the new expressions, eqs.(6.11)-(6.13).\nThis is because all these quantities are now defined with the procedure eq.(6.9), which takes into\naccount the internal structure of the bodies. As a result, the Newtonian acceleration of the\nextended body (A) with respect to the barycentric RFo now is given as\n\n*%>(V\xc2\xb0A> = -^\n\nE\n\n+ ^c-4).\n\n(6.14)\n\nFurthermore, in order to take into account the extent of the bodies and the influence of this\nextent on the post-Newtonian dynamics of the N-body system, the time-dependent function w^\nhas been replaced by the new function w^Q :\n^o(3/A) = ^o + ^0>\n\n(6-15a)\n\nwhere the function w^ is determined as the solution of the following differential equation:\n\n+ 0%,\n)\n\nand the function Sw^ is unknown at the moment. This function will be determined later, when\nwe will apply conditions (3.29) in order to make the total momentum of the matter, the inertia,\n85\n\nand the gravitational field calculated in the coordinates of the proper RF.4 vanish in the volume\nof the body (A).\nAs a result, the \'averaged\' components of the metric tensor g^n in the coordinates (y^) of\nthe proper RF^ take the following form:\n\n= 1-2U\n\n+2 E [d0LA{L}(y\xc2\xb0A) + vAo0d0Q0A{L}(y0A)] \xe2\x80\xa2 y{AL} + C?(|^lfc+1) + O(c~e),\n\n(6.16o)\n\n(LA(L}(yQA) + vAof3 \xe2\x80\xa2 QpA{L}(y\xc2\xb0A })--] \xe2\x80\xa2 y{AL}+\ny\nA\n\nl\n\n) + G(c-5},\n\n(6.166)\n\n+ 0(c-4),\n\n(6.16c)\n\nwhere the total gravitational potential U at the vicinity of the body (A) is composed of the\nlocal Newtonian potential generated by the body (A) itself, and the tidal gravitational potential\nproduced by the external sources of gravity is given by expression (6.10). This potential may\nnow be obtained from (6.13a) as follows:\n\n+ (UB) A ] + O( C ~ 4 ).\n\n= E VB(y\'B(fi\xc2\xbb ~ E [ A ( j )\nB\n\n(6.17)\n\nThis potential is the solution of the corresponding Poisson equation in the coordinates\n\nwhich is searched for together with the following integral boundary conditions:\n(U) A = f d*y\'A pA(y\'Z)U(y\'D = I d*y\'A pA(y\'$UA(y\'A)\nJA\n\nJA\n\nuyA\n86\n\n- = 0.\n\n(6.19o)\n\n(6.196)\n\nThe quantity Va(y^) in the expressions in (6.166) is the total vector potential produced by\nall the bodies in the system as seen in the coordinates (j/^) of the RF^. The averaging procedure\n(6.9) enables one to define this potential as follows:\n\n\xc2\xbb(c-4).\n\n(6.20)\n\nIt is interesting to note that the vector potential now depends on the coupling of the intrinsic\nmotion of matter in the body (A) to the gradient of the external gravitational field. Thus, it\ncan be seen from expression (6.13) for the function QaA that this coupling contributes to the\ncorresponding precession term of the coordinates in this RF relative to the barycentric inertial\nframe. This potential also satisfies the usual Poisson equation of the form\n\nMoreover, due to the covariant equation of continuity, (6.3). both quantities (6.17) and (6.21)\nare connected by the following relation:\n\nau\n\n=\n\nav\n\n~\n\n(6 22)\n\n\'\n\nAnother quantity we have introduced in expressions (6.16) is W(y^}. This is the postNewtonian contribution to the component 500 of the effective metric tensor in coordinates\ngiven by (6.16a). This contribution is given as follows:\n(6.23a)\nB\n\nThe solution (6.23a) repeats the structure of the tidal representation of the Newtonian potential\n(6.17), so it could be considered as the generalized post-Newtonian potential in this RF. The functions WA and WB in expression (6.23a) are given by relations (5.43), and they fully represent the\nnon-linearity of the total post-Newtonian gravitational field in the proper RF^. These functions\ncontain contributions of two sorts: (i) the gravitational field produced by the external bodies in\nthe system (B^A), and (ii) the field of inertia caused by the accelerated and non-geodesic motion\nof the proper RF^. This happens due to the coupling of the proper multipole moments of the\nbody (A) to the external gravitational field as well as to the self-action contributions that are\ngiven by the terms with Q\\sj\\ m expressions (5.43). One may obtain the corresponding Poissonlike equation for this potential as well. Thus, directly from the gravitational field equation (4.4d),\nthis last equation will take the form\n\n2\n\nE\nB\n\n-2 E E <%{L}(VA) KA^B \' ^ + WB \xe2\x80\xa2 dxdx]y(AL} + C(|i\xc2\xa3|fc+1) + O(c~&}.\n87\n\n(6.23ft)\n\nWe have not yet presented the last function that is necessary to complete the coordinate transformation for the extended bodies, namely: the function Sw^Q from (6.15). To find this function,\none needs to apply the procedure for constructing a \'good\' proper RF with full post-Newtonian\naccuracy. In order to do this, one must perform the study of the existence of conservation laws\nin the proper RF^ and define the conserved quantities that will correspond to the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the local fields. Then, after integrating these quantities over\nthe body\'s compact volume, one must find the form of the eq.m. for the extended bodies in their\nproper RFs. These equations will contain the time derivatives of the only unknown function,\n<5tf/ij[o, which should be chosen in such a way that conditions (3.29) will be satisfied.\n\n6.2\n\nConservation Laws in the Proper RF.\n\nAs we have stated before, our goal is to construct a formalism that will be useful for calculations in\na number of the metric theories of gravity. This is the reason why in our further discussion we will\nuse the method developed for analysis of the conservation laws in parametrized post-Newtonian\ngravity developed by Fock and Chandrasekhar (Fock, 1955; Ehlers, 1967; Denisov &; Turyshev,\n1989; Will, 1993). It is known that the most important question for any metric theory of gravity\nis the presence or absence of laws of conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum\nfor the closed system of interacting fields. Strictly speaking, the solution to this question requires\ndetailed information regarding the structure of each metric theory of gravitation. It is necessary\nto know what geometric object has been chosen to describe the gravitational field, what geometry\nis natural for it, and what is the form of the equation connecting the gravitational field and the\nmetric of the Riemann space-time. Using the standard methods of theoretical physics, it is then\npossible to give an exhaustive answer to this question. However, such an analysis cannot be\ncarried out in a general form for all metric theories of gravity at once. This leaves us with only\none option: attempt to obtain some information regarding the possibility of the existence of\nconservation laws in these theories by proceeding only from the eq.m. of matter in the WFSMA.\nIt should be noted that conditions obtained in this way are necessary but not sufficient to prove\nthe existence of integral conservation laws for matter and the gravitational field taken jointly in\na particular metric theory of gravitation. It is altogether possible that, although the necessary\nconditions are satisfied for some theory of gravitation, there nevertheless may not be conservation\nlaws for a closed system of interacting fields. The reason for this situation is that quantities that\ndo not depend on time, obtained on the basis of post-Newtonian equations of motion, may not\nhave the character of integrals of motion for a closed system and hence also have no physical\nmeaning. Therefore, in resolving the question of whether or not conservation laws are present in\na particular theory of gravitation, the last word can be said only after a complete analysis of the\ntheory has been performed.\nIt is known that general relativity in the WFSMA possesses the integral conservation laws for\nthe energy-momentum tensor of matter and the gravitational field taken jointly. It means that\nthe covariant equation of conservation of the energy-momentum tensor of matter in Riemann\nspace-time, (6.1), can be identically represented as the covariant conservation law of the sum of\nsymmetric energy-momentum tensors of the gravitational field t\xe2\x84\xa2n and matter i\xe2\x84\xa2 in space-time\nof a constant curvature:\nV k f mk = 0 =0 Pfe (t\xe2\x84\xa2k + t^fc) = 0.\n(6.24)\nIt should be especially emphasized that, since in an arbitrary Riemann space-time the operation of integrating tensors (with the exception of scalar density) is meaningless from a math88\n\nematical point of view, it follows that the presence of some differential conservation equations\nin this case does not guarantee the possibility of obtaining corresponding integral conservation\nlaws. The possibility of obtaining integral conservation laws in a Riemann space-time is entirely\npredetermined by its geometry and closely connected with the existence of Killing vectors of the\ngiven space-time. Namely, only an equation of the form of (6.24) guarantees the existence of all\nten integral conservation laws for a closed system of interacting fields. Indeed, since, in a spacetime of constant curvature the Killing equations T>mTjn + /Dn\'nm = 0 are completely integrable and\ntheir solutions contain the maximal possible number, M= 10, of arbitrary parameters (Eisenhart,\n1926), we have ten independent Killing vectors in this case. Multiplying (6.24) successively by\neach of these vectors %, we obtain\n= -==d k [r,m (t\xe2\x84\xa2k + iff) ^\\\n\n= 0.\n\n(6.25)\n\nSince the left side of this expression is a scalar, we can integrate it over a three-dimensional\nvolume (Logunov, 1987) and obtain all ten (the number of independent Killing vectors) integral\nconservation laws for a system consisting of matter, inertia, and a gravitational field taken jointly.\nThus, in general relativity, which possesses the integral conservation laws, expressions for the\nintegrals of motion of an isolated system can be determined also from the equation of motion\nof matter, eq.(6.1). We shall find a necessary condition that the post-Newtonian expansions of\nthis theory in the proper quasi-inertial RF must satisfy and obtain post-Newtonian expansions\nof integrals of the motion required for subsequent computation. For this we should transform\nthe covariant conservation equation (6.1) to the form of eq.(6.24), after which, multiplying this\nrelation by the corresponding Killing vectors of a space of constant curvature and integrating over the volume, we may easily obtain the desired expressions. Since the metric tensor of\nRiemann space-time in the absence of matter (po = p = 0) should have as its limit the pseudoEuclidean Minkowski metric, the covariant conservation equation (6.1) should be transformed to\nthe conservation law (6.24) just in the pseudo-Euclidean space-time. Then in the quasi-Cartesian\ncoordinates of the barycentric inertia! RFo, expression (6.24) will take the form\nV k f mk = dk (t\xe2\x84\xa2k + t^k) = 0.\n\n(6.26)\n\nWe expect that the \'good\' proper RF will resemble the properties of the inertia! RFo; then in the\ncoordinates of this proper RF, the expression, analogous to that of (6.24), should take the form\nof the conservation law of the total energy-momentum tensor of the fields of inertia, matter, and\ngravity taken jointly:\nfc\n\n+ Cfc+tMfc=0-\n\n(6.27)\n\nKnowledge of the metric (6.16) to a post-Newtonian degree of accuracy makes it possible\nto determine the components of the energy-momentum tensor in the next approximation. Indeed, using the definition for Tmn) (6.2); the metric (6.16); the expressions for the four-velocity,\neqs.(.E4) and (.5136); and also the covariant components of the metric tensor, (55a), we obtain\nthe following expressions for the components of the density of the energy-momentum tensor in\nthe post-Newtonian approximation in the coordinates of the proper\nU + 0(c-4) ,\n\n=p[l\n\n89\n\n(6.28a)\n\n= pva l + n -\n\nt7X +\n\n+ tf + 0(c-4) ,\n\n(6.286)\n\n+ n - lt,X + ? + Z7] - PTQ/?+\n4\n\n) + 0(\\y\xc2\xbb A \\ k + i ),\n\n(6.28c)\n\nwhere the total conserved mass density of the entire system p is given by (6.4).\nFurthermore, by using the solutions for the transformation functions (6.11) and (6.13), from\nthe expressions (F2) one may obtain the Christoffel symbols of the Riemann metric in the proper\nKFA in the form\n\n- W-U +4\n\n-\n\n^\n\n+\n\n7y^AMa^OA+\n\n(6.29.)\n\nWriting (6.1) for m = 0 and substituting (6.28) and (6.29) into it, we obtain\n\nThus, to bring this relation to the form of (6.27), it is necessary to transform the last two terms\nby extracting from them the partial derivatives with respect to time and the three-dimensional\ndivergence. Such a transformation cannot be carried out in a unique manner. Therefore, using\n90\n\nequations (6.18) and (6.21), we rewrite the given terms in the most general form reflecting this\nambiguity:\n\n(6\n\n4?r\nwhere ai and 02 are arbitrary numbers. With consideration of this relation, and collecting like\nterms in (6.30), we get\nyA\n\nwith the following expressions for the (00) and (Oa) components of the density of the total\nenergy-momentum tensor:\n\n(6.326)\n\nir\n\n^a _day^\n\n+\n\np0(c-5)\n\n4?r\nWriting expression (6.1) for n = a and substituting (6.28) and (6.29) into it, we have\n\np9QF - pd\'w + paQl/(n - 2l^u" +p=\nV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2A)+E[<\na\n\n[**A{L}{yA)\xc2\xb0 A-f\nE \\n^ (v\xc2\xb0.M^ T ^\n*\n\n91\n\n(6 32c)\n\nOne may note that these expressions are not dependent on the function LA.IL} with / > 3. This\nmeans that, in the post-Newtonian order, the function QA/X} ^h ^ \xe2\x80\x94 3 only is responsible for\nthe existence of the integrals of motion in the RF^ under consideration.\nTo reduce this equation to the form of (6.27), we use the identities presented in Appendix H.\nSubstituting these into (6.33) and collecting the like terms, we obtain\n\n5\n\n),\n\n(6.34)\n\nwith the following expressions for the (aO) and (a/?) components of the density of the total\nenergy-momentum tensor:\n\n47T\n\nOl/\n\n-\n\na\n\nv\n\nTT\n\n(6.35)\n\nj.a/3 , +a0\\ _ pa/3\n7 r _ -ry\nl\nw\ng + 1 M) - L\n\\u\n\ny\n\nuyA\n\nu\n\ny~A\n\nu\n\n_ + [d\xc2\xbbva yA\n\n+\\\n\n(6.36)\n\nIt can be shown that the expression on the right-hand side of relation (6.34) cannot be represented as four-dimensional divergence of any combination of generalized gravitational potentials\nand characteristics of the ideal fluid. Then for arbitrary functions Q^/^i, the expression (6.33)\n92\n\ncannot be reduced to the form of (6.27). However, since general relativity possesses all conservation laws, such a reduction is always possible, and it follows that we must require that all the\nfunctions Q * J \\ with / > 3 vanish:\n0,\n\nVZ>3.\n\n(6.37o)\n\nIn addition to this, as we have noticed earlier, the functions LA{L} with (I > 3) do not\nenter the eq.m. in (6.33) at all and any choice of these functions will not affect the dynamics of\nthe system of the extended bodies in the WFSMA. This suggests that these functions may be\nconsidered as the infinitesimal gauge functions and, without losing generality of the description,\nwe may set these functions to be zero:\nLA{L}(y\xc2\xb0A) = 0,\n\nVJ > 3.\n\n(6.376)\n\nMoreover, in correspondence with the definition in (6.27), in metric theories of gravitation\nthat possess all conservation laws, expression (6.36) must then contain the components of the\ncomplete energy-momentum tensor of matter and gravitational field in pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Since below we shall mainly be interested in the components ta\xc2\xb0 of this tensor, comparing\nthe expressions for it given by (6.32c) and (6.35), we can see that tf\' + tf\' + tftf \xc2\xb1 tf\xc2\xb0 + tf + t^.\nTherefore, although it is possible to obtain the conservation laws of energy and momentum, it\nis not yet sufficient for obtaining the remaining conservation laws for which it is required that\nthe components of the complete energy-momentum tensor of the system be symmetric. For\nour purposes, in order to ensure the symmetry of the complete energy-momentum tensor of the\nsystem, we should set\n,\nai = -2,\na2 = 0.\n(6.38)\nThus, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the existence of all conservation laws in any\nmetric theory of gravitation is that relations (6.37) and (6.38) should hold.\nWith consideration of these equalities, the component t\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 of (6.32a) of the complete energymomentum tensor will have the form\n3tf)\n\n(6.39)\n\nThis expression can be used to describe the energy distribution of the system in space, while the\ncomponent taQ of (6.35) can be used to describe the density of momentum. Integrating expression\n(6.39) for the energy-momentum tensor over the body (A)\'s volume space and using the trivial\nrelation\n/ (Py\'^Ud^U = -47T / d3y\'ApU + <j> dSA Ud^U,\n(6.40)\nJA\nJA\nJA\nwe obtain the following expression for the energy P\xc2\xb0 of the system of matter, inertia, and\ngravitational field defined in the vicinity of the body (A) as usual:\nP\xc2\xb0 = mA = JA d*y\'A(t\xe2\x84\xa2 + tf + i\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0) .\nThis corresponds to the following result for the total mass of the fields in this\n\n93\n\n(6.41a)\n\nmA = I d3y\'Ap(l + II - \\VlsP - \\U] + 1- <f dSA Ud^U =\nJA\n\n=\n\n^\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n4\n\nd3y\'ApA i + n - i^x1 - uA + L.\n\n\'\n\nO7T J A\n\nd5M\n\n3^2 + mAO(c-3}\n\n(6\n\nThe obtained result may be presented in terms of the unperturbed mass mA(Q) of the body (A)\nas follows:\n7\nr\nmA = mA(0) + \xe2\x80\x94 j dSA d^U2 + mAO(C-3),\n(6.42)\nwhere the second term represents the contribution of the coupling of the proper gravitational field\nof the body under study to the external gravity. This term is zero in the case of an isolated body,\nbecause one may move the boundary of integration to infinite distance. Taking into account that\nthe integrand behaves as r~ 3 , one makes the conclusion that this integral is zero. One loses\nthis useful option in the case of the N-body system, and, due to this reason, we must take into\naccount such \'surface\' effects in order to correctly describe the perturbed motion of the bodies\nin the system.\nThe momentum PA of the system of fields in the coordinates of this RFA is determined in an\nentirely analogous way: by integrating component ia\xc2\xb0 of (6.35) of the complete energy-momentum\ntensor over the compact volume of the body (A),\n+ tf + $.\n\n(6.43a)\n\nA\n\nThen for momentum PA we obtain the following expression:\nPA= I d3yA\nJA\n4?r\n\n+ -dJj(daVv - dvVa}} + p0(c-5).\n^\n\n(6.436)\n\nFinally, the requirement of (3.29) may be fulfilled by integrating equation (6.34) over the\nvolume of the body (A) and choosing the function 6wAo such that the corresponding momentum\nPA in the RF^ will vanish for all times. However, as we will see later, this requirement is\nnot easy to satisfy. The problem one is faced with is that the system of the fields and matter\noverlapping the body (A) is not a closed system. This system is a part of a bigger ensemble\nof celestial bodies that was initially taken to be a closed N-body system. The definitions for\nthe energy and momentum of the system may not be given in the local form; instead these\nquantities are non-zero in all regions of the system. As a result of such a non-locality, one loses\nthe possibility of eliminating the integrals from the three-divergences. Thus, in the analysis of the\nconservational laws in the gravitational one-body problem, one can integrate such divergences\nby using the Stokes theorem and moving the surface of integration at the infinite distance (Fock,\n1959; Denisov &: Turyshev, 1989; Will, 1993). In the case of coordinates originated with the\nquasi-inertial proper RF, such an integration is meaningless. Instead, one may integrate the\ncorresponding quantities on the surface of the body under consideration. As a result, one may\nsee from expressions (6.32) that the mass in the proper RF is not a constant anymore. Thus, by\nintegrating expression (6.32a) over the body (A)\'s compact volume, we obtain\nJL \xc2\xa3 dSA [Mfijjr + ^(ffVf, - dpV)} + mA0(c-5).\n94\n\n(6.44)\n\nThe integral on the right-hand side of the expression above vanishes in the case of an isolated\ndistribution of matter, but for the N-body problem in the quasi-inertial RF it depends on the\nmagnitude of the fields on the surface of the body under study. Analysis of the conservation\nlaws is the only way to correctly define the important physical quantities, such as the mass,\nmomentum, and angular momentum of the field in the local region of the body. One expects\nthat, in the immediate vicinity of the origin of the coordinate system in the \'good\' proper RF, the\nform of these laws should resemble that which was developed by Fock (1955) and Chandrasekhar\n(1965) for the inertial frames. Therefore, we will use the technique that was developed for the\nbarycentric approach by modifying it for the case under consideration.\nHere we must mention the following circumstance. It follows from eq.(6.35) and eq.(6.43)\nthat, in \'the post-Newtonian approximation, the density of the total momentum of the system,\nin contrast to the barycentric RFo, can be written in the coordinates of the proper RF only in\nthe non-local form of (6.35) when the components ta\xc2\xb0 are non-zero, generally speaking, in the\nentire space. Unfortunately, this expression cannot be written in the local form that would be\nnonzero only in the region occupied by the body (A) because of the presence of external sources\nof gravity. Comparing (6.32a) and (6.40), we can draw an analogous conclusion regarding the\nenergy density of the system. Since the total momentum and total energy of the system in the\npost-Newtonian approximation do not depend on the form in which one chooses to write them,\nthe momentum and energy of the gravitational field, which are non-local by their nature, can\nbe effectively considered in this approximation by adding local terms to the energy density of\nmatter. The latter circumstance is especially convenient in computing the motion of complex\nsystems, since it lets us distinguish in explicit form the total momentum and energy of each of\nthe bodies of the system.\nTherefore, we shall henceforth use the following expression for the density of the total momentum of matter, inertia, and the gravitational field in the volume occupied by the body:\n\nTT\n\n^\n\n\'J\n\n(6.45)\n\nand for the total energy density, we shall use the expression\n(6.46)\nThe relationships obtained will be used in order to define the eq.m. of the extended bodies\'\nforms with respect to the coordinates of the proper RF/i. Note that by integrating expressions\n(6.45) and (6.46) over the compact volumes of the bodies in the system, one may obtain the\nmass and the momentum of these bodies measured with respect to the proper RF^. Such relative\nquantities may be very important in the analysis of the relativistic gravitational experiments in\nthe solar system that we will discuss in the next section. In order to complete the formulation\nof the coordinate transformations to the \'good\' proper RFyi, we should present the function that\nwas not yet determined, namely the function 6w^Q.\n\n95\n\n6.3\n\nThe Solution for the Function 6w%0.\n\nTo obtain the equation of motion of extended bodies in the gravitational field, we must first\nbring the covariant conservation equation (6.33) to the form\n(g 47)\n\nwhere ta\xc2\xb0 is defined by (6.45), and .P* represents the entire remaining part of (6.33) and can\nbe considered the force density acting on matter. This is exactly the force we have mentioned\nin Section 3 while discussing expressions (3.27). After performing identity transformations using\neqs.(6.3) and (6.6), we obtain from eq.(6.33):\n\n- pdau(n - Zt \xc2\xabx + ^\nf\n^\n\n(6.48)\n\nThe eq.m. of each body can be obtained if (6.44) is integrated over the volume occupied by this\nbody. In order to find the function Sw1^ , we should start with finding the eq.m. of the body (A)\nrelative to its own RF. Integrating (6.48) over the VA, we obtain\nr1Pa\n\n=n(&),\n\n(6.49)\n\nwhere P\xc2\xa3 is given by expression (6.436) and\n\n\'1\').\n\n\'\n\n(6.50)\n\nIn order to define the function <5uM 0 (yA)> we w^^ require that the momentum of the body (A)\nin its proper RF will vanish. This requirement may be fulfilled if the equation for 8wA 0 (y ( A> *s\nchosen in the following form:\n\n(6.51)\n96\n\nAs a result, one may obtain the differential equation for the total post-Newtonian acceleration\nw^0 from (6.13), which is necessary to apply in order to hold the extended body in the state of\nequilibrium in its proper RF. Thus, with the help of expressions (6.15) and (6.51), we obtain the\nfollowing equation:\n\nf \xc2\xabx + f +\n\n(6.52)\n\nFor practical purposes, one may find the value of the surface integrals in expression (6.52) by\nperforming the iteration procedure. Thus, it is easy to show that the lowest multipole moments\nof the bodies will not contribute to this surface integration. However, the general results will\nfully depend on the non-linear interaction of the intrinsic multipole moments with the external\ngravity in the local region at the vicinity of the body under consideration. This additional\niterative option will make all the results obtained with the proposed formalism easy to use in\nthe practical applications.\nAs one may see, we have reconstructed the post-Newtonian non-linear group of motion for\nthe WFSMA. Thus, the straight transformation is given by eqs.(6.11)-(6.13). Substitution of the\nresults obtained for the transformation functions in relations (3.18) will give the inverse transformation. Finally, the common element of this group may be obtained by making use of relations\n(3.19)-(3.20). These results generalize and specify those obtained by Chandrasekhar & Contopulos (1967) and given by (1.12). In this previous work, the post-Galilean transformations that\npreserve the invariancy of the metric tensor were obtained. In contrast to these, our transformations, eqs.(6.11)-(6.13), in general, transform the coordinates in different non-inertial RFs and\nwere specifically defined for a system of self-gravitating extended and arbitrarily shaped bodies.\nComparison with the Poincare group of motion, (1.7), expanded similarly in inverse powers of c\nshows the following:\n(i). The spatial part of the transformations up to the terms O(c~2) includes the Lorentzian\nterms and allows, in addition, infinitesimal rotations, uniform motion, the shift of the\norigin, and the terms due to the gravitational coupling of the internal multipoles of the\nextended bodies with the external gravitation.\n\n97\n\n(ii). The temporal part of the transformation includes the Lorentzian terms up to O(c 4) plus\nadditional terms of a purely gravitational nature, as well as the terms due to precession of\nthe spatial axes. It is the presence of these gravitational terms in both spatial and temporal components of the transformation that gives the transformation its non-Lorentzian\ncharacter.\nAs one can see, the obtained coordinate transformations are in general the non-local ones.\nAs such, they represent an important and powerful way to study the nature of the multipolar\nstructure of a system of extended bodies and their gravitational interaction in the WFSMA of\nthe general theory of relativity. In the next section, we will discuss the generalization of theobtained results to the case of the scalar-tensor theories of gravity.\n\n98\n\n7\n\nParameterized Proper RF.\n\nIn this section, we will further generalize the results obtained for the coordinate transformations\nand the metric tensor in the proper RF, which were obtained in the previous section. In order\nto generalize the results obtained, we have applied the presented formalism to the scalar-tensor\ntheories of gravity. It should be noted that considerable interest has recently been shown in the\nphysical processes occurring in the strong gravitational field regime. However, many modern\ntheoretical models that include general relativity as a standard gravity theory are faced with\nthe problem of the unavoidable appearance of space-time singularities. It is well known that the\nclassical description, provided by general relativity, breaks down in a domain where the curvature\nis large, and, hence, a proper understanding of such regions requires new physics (Horowitz &;\nMyers, 1995). The tensor-scalar theories of gravity, in which the usual general relativity tensor field coexists together with one or several long-range scalar fields, are believed to be the\nmost interesting extension of the theoretical foundation of modern gravitational theory. The\nsuperstring, many-dimensional Kaluza-Klein and inflationary cosmology theories have revived\ninterest in so-called \'dilaton fields,\' i.e., neutral scalar fields whose background values determine\nthe strength of the coupling constants in the effective four-dimensional theory. However, although the scalar field naturally arises in theory, its existence leads to a violation of the strong\nequivalence principle and modification of large-scale gravitational phenomena (Damour et al.,\n1990; Damour & Taylor, 1992; Damour & Esposito-Farese, 1992; Damour & Nordtvedt, 1993;\nBerkin &; Hellings, 1994; Turyshev, 1996). Moreover, the presence of the scalar field affects the\nequations of motion of the other matter fields as well (Turyshev, 1996), which makes it interesting to study the opportunities for advanced dynamical tests of these theories in the WFSMA\nbefore they will be applied to the strong-field-regime research. Therefore, the motivation for the\npresent work was to perform a similar full-scale analysis of the WFSMA for some tensor-scalar\ntheories of gravity in order to generalize the results obtained previously.\n\n7.1 Parameterized Coordinate Transformations.\nIn this subsection, we will present the results of the relativistic study of the Brans-Dicke theory\nof gravity (Will, 1993). However, due to the length of the expressions and also in order to avoid\nunreasonable complication of the discussion in this section, we will not present here the details\nof these calculations. Instead, we have introduced the two Eddington parameters (7, (3) in order\nto present the obtained relations in a more compact form valid for a number of modern metric\ntheories of gravity. This gives us a chance to present the final results only. One may repeat the\nnecessary calculations using the technique of the general post-Newtonian power expansions in\nthe WFSMA developed in the appendices.\nBy taking into account the properties of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, and by applying the\nrules for constructing the proper RF presented in Section 2, one may obtain the set of differential\nequations on the transformation functions K.A, Q% and LA- As a result, the relativistic coordinate transformation between coordinates (xp) of RFo to those (j/^) of the proper quasi-inertial\nof an arbitrary body (A) may be given as follows:\n\n*\xc2\xb0 = VA\nOne may obtain the necessary corrections of the third order with respect to spatial separation\nfor functions (7.2) in a manner analogous to that used for the derivations in Section 5. Then the\n99\n\nparameterized coordinate transformation functions 1C A, Q% and LA. may be given as follows:\nvAov - y\\ + O(c^)y^\n\n(7.2a)\n\nSitfAM = -i E (y%\n\n>o + ft + 1)E [<^} +\n+ O(c^)y%\n\n(7.26)\n\n= E\n\nB^A\n\n"\n\nL\\\n\nI A\n\n\\\n\n~ I 4J }\n\n[(7\n\nB+A\n1\n\nV"^\n\ng\n\n/\n\n//\n\nT,\n\nft\n\n^ VAV^VA\n\nI\n\nI i \'W \\ v v p v & / n\n\n-^W\n\n(7.2c)\n\nNote that, in order to distinguish between the PPN parameter 7 and the Minkowski tensor 7mn,\nwe are using new notation for this tensor, namely: r]mn = 7mn = diag(l, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x941). The timedependent functions Q\xc2\xb0ASI\\ and LA{L} in expressions (7.2) are the contributions coming from\nthe higher multipoles (I > 3) (both mass and current induced) of the external gravitational field\ngenerated by the bodies (B^A) in the system. These functions enable one to take into account\nthe geometric features of the proper RF^ with respect to three-dimensional spatial rotation.\nThe form of these functions may be chosen arbitrarily. This freedom enables one to choose any\ncoordinate dependence for the terms with I > 3 in order to describe the motion of the highest\nmonopoles. Moreover, one may show that, even though the total solution to the metric tensor\n9mn(xp) m the barycentric inertial RFo resembles the form of the one-body solution, eqs.(2.5), if\none expresses this solution through the proper multipole moments of the bodies, it will contain\nthe contributions coming from the functions Q^r L \\(y^) and LA{L}(y Q A>- AS a resmt) the metric\n100\n\ntensor in the proper RF^ fully represents the tidal nature of the external gravity in the coordinates\nof this frame.\nThe quasi-Newtonian acceleration of the body (A) with respect to the barycentric RFo may\nbe described as follows:\nA\n\n+ <Xc-6).\n\n(7.3a)\n\nWith the accuracy necessary for future analysis, we present the equation for the time-dependent\nfunction w.<Ao(y\'A) with respect to the time yQA as follows:\n\n+\n0(c~6).\n\n(7.36)\n\nExpressions (7.3) are the two parts of the force necessary to keep the body (A) in its orbit (world\ntube) in the N-body system. These expressions are written in the proper time and, if one performs\nthe coordinate transformation from coordinates (y^) to those of (xp) for all the functions and\npotentials entering both equations. (7.3), and takes into account the lowest intrinsic multipole\nmoments of the bodies only, one will obtain the simplified equations of motion for the extended\nbodies, (2.14)-(2.20), written in coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFoFinally, the metric tensor, corresponding to the coordinate transformations (7.1)-(7.3), will\ntake the form of the Fermi-normal-like proper RF^ chosen to study the physical processes in the\nvicinity of the body (A):\n\nB+A\n\n101\n\ni7 E h\n\xe2\x80\xa2 yAyA + 0(|j\xc2\xa3|3) + 0(c-4),\n\n(7 Ac)\n\nwhere the total Newtonian potential U in the vicinity of the body (A) is given by expression\n(6.17). Both functions WA and WB are parameterized by the two Eddington parameters 7 and\n/3 as follows:\n\n24, -\n\n-(37 + 1-2/3) /\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2MtoX- J/A\n\n+ib E fn^V(\xc2\xabi\xc2\xbbo\n\n-(37 + 1-2/3) / /^\n(y%\nJB \\y A \xe2\x80\x94 y A \\PB\n\ny\xc2\xb0A,\n<<>A\n\n- "A\n\nB,\n\nI\n\nThe functions WA and WB fully represent the non-linearity of the total post-Newtonian gravitational field in the Fermi-normal-like coordinates of the proper RF. As a result, we have obtained\nthe metric tensor in the Fermi-normal-like coordinates and the coordinate transformations leading to this form. These transformations are denned up to the third order with respect to the\nspatial coordinates. Let us note that, as a partial result of the analysis presented in the previous section, we have shown that the Fermi-normal-like coordinates do not provide one with\nthe conservation laws of the joint density of the energy-momentum of matter, inertia, and the\ngravitational field in the immediate vicinity of the body under consideration. However, taking\ninto account the expected accuracy of the radio-tracking data from the future Mercury Orbiter\nmission, we can neglect the influence of the corresponding effects and, therefore, use the Ferminormal-like coordinates for our theoretical studies. As a result, we will analyze the motion of\nthe spacecraft in orbit around Mercury from the position of parameterized relativistic gravity.\n\n102\n\n7.2\n\nEquations of the Spacecraft Motion.\n\nWe will now obtain the equations of the spacecraft motion in a Hermean-centric RF. To do\nthis, we consider a Riemann space-time whose metric coincides with the metric of N moving\nextended bodies. We shall study the motion of a point body in the neighborhood of the body\n(A). The expression for the acceleration of the point body a?0^ can be obtained in two ways\xe2\x80\x94\neither by using the equations of geodesies of Riemann space-time dun/ds + T^nkumuk = 0 or\nby computing the acceleration of the center of mass of the extended body and then letting all\nquantities characterizing its internal structure and proper gravitational field tend to zero. In\neither case, one obtains the same result (Denisov & Turyshev, 1990).\nIn order to obtain the Hermean-centric equations of the satellite motion, we will write out\nthe equations of geodesies to the required degree of accuracy. For n = a, we have\n\n+ 21^11 V + r^<V = e>(c-6).\n\n(7.6)\n\nWe consider the metric tensor of Riemann space-time to be given by expressions (7.4) in this\ncase. It is then possible to find the connection components of Riemann space-time needed for\nsubsequent computations:\n\n, (7.7o)\n\n= 7^\n\n+ (7 + 1) \xc2\xa3\n\na\n\n+ (7\n\n- v\n\n}\n\nU\n\nB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 y\xc2\xbbA + 0(\\ytf} + O(c\'5},\n\ny* + O(\\y\xc2\xbb A \\ 2 ) + O(c^}.\n\n(7.7b)\n\n(7.7c)\n\nTo reduce the equation of geodesic motion, (7.6), we shall use both the expressions above and\nthe definition for the four-vector of velocity in the form\n\n103\n\nU\n\nThen by taking into account that d/ds = uQd/dy\\ (with the components of the three-dimensional\nvelocity vector of the point body denoted as v?Q^ = dy^/dy^) and by using the Newtonian\nequation of motion of a point body as\n\nwe may make the following simplification:\n\nSubstituting this relation into the equations of motion, (7.6), we find the acceleration a?Qv of the\npoint body:\n_\n\njD -jc jH\n\n- (27 -\n\n+2(7\n\nBy expanding all the potentials in (7.8) in power series of I/J/BAO and retaining terms with\ny a /\\yBA 0 \\ only to the required accuracy, we then obtain\n+ O(c~6):\n\n(7.9)\n\nwhere the post-Newtonian acceleration ^a/\xe2\x84\xa2 due to the gravitational field of the body (A) only\nmay be given as\n\n104\n\nA\n\n= 2(7 + /3)UAd\xc2\xb0UA - (7 + bda$lA + (2/3 - \xc2\xa3\n\n+(1 - 7)#a$4A + daAA - (27 + I)if0) W\n-2(7 + lKo>\xc2\xab5\xc2\xbb W* - 2(7 + lho)\n-2(7 + 1)\n\n^^J5\n\nS"V2 - daVA\n\n- 1(47 + 3)\n\nThis term is known and reasonably well understood (Denisov & Turyshev, 1990). The term\nSABa?0\\ is the acceleration due to the interaction of the gravitational field of the extended body\n(A) with the external gravitation in the N-body system:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ((2/3 + 7 - 1)^ + 2(3/3 + 7 - 1)JV|\n5NBAo\xc2\xa3NBAoX}\n\n+ O(|y^| 2 ) + O(c~^ (7.11)\n\nwhere 5^e is the reduced spin moment of the body (A) and P^\\ = r]e\\ + 3NsAocNBAox is tne P\xc2\xb0larizing operator. Note that the combination of the post-Newtonian parameters in the first term\nof expression (7.11) differs from that for the well-known Nordtvedt effect (Nordtvedt, 1968b,c;\nWill, 1993). This may provide an independent test for the parameters involved. The reason that\nour third term in this expression differs from the analogous term derived in Ashby & Bertotti\n(1986) is that, in order to obtain this result, (7.9)-(7.11), we used the consistent definitions for\nthe conserved mass density in the proper RF^. Moreover, in constructing the Fermi normal coordinates previous authors used incomplete expressions for the spatial coordinate transformations,\nwhich differ from eq.(7.2) (specifically in the third order of the spatial coordinates). Note that\nif we decide to use our definitions, the result cited above will take the form of (7.11). The next\nterm, 630.^, is the post-Newtonian acceleration caused by the other bodies in the system on the\norbit of the body (A) (the effect of the post-Newtonian tidal forces):\n- 16/3 - 17))\n\n(4/3 - 7 -\n\n105\n\n+f\n\n+ C?(|^|2) + 0(c-6).\n\n+2(7 + l i b B A o ^ - wg^]\n\n(7.12)-\n\nFinally, the last term in expression (7.9), SBC^Q)-, is the contribution to the equation of motion of\nthe non-linear gravitational interaction of the external bodies with each other, given as follows:\n\n[3(7 - VP2\n\nE tf y\n^\xc2\xa5-\n\n?A,B\n\n\\ BAo VCAo\n\n+(2/3 - l)N%AoNCA0\xc2\xbb - NSAoNBAo J] +\n\n1\n\na\n\nmBmc\n3\n\n1\n\n!4l2) + 0(c-6).\n\nL[(2/3 - 37 + i)^\n\n^\n\n3\n\n(7.13)\n\nThus, the equations presented in this subsection are represent the motion of a test body in\nthe Fermi-normal-like coordinates chosen in the proper RF of a body (A). Together with the\ncoordinate transformations, (7.1)-(7.3), this is the general solution of the gravitational N body\nproblem.\nWe present here the restricted version of the equations, which is consistent with the expected\naccuracy for ESA\'s Mercury Orbiter mission. This limited accuracy permits us to completely\nneglect contributions proportional to the spatial coordinates yA. The planeto-centric equations\nof satellite motion around Mercury can be represented by a series of I/|J/BA O | as follows:\n\n- 37 B+A\n\n(7.14)\n106\n\nwhere index (A) denotes the planet Mercury, and the post-Newtonian acceleration SAO,^ is due\nto the gravitational field of Mercury only.\nThus, the formalism presented in this section could significantly simplify the general analysis\nof the tracking data for the Mercury Orbiter mission. We have presented the Hermean-centric\nequations of satellite motion, the barycentric equations of the planet\'s motion in the solar system\nbarycentric RF, and the coordinate transformations that link these equations together. In particular, our analysis has shown that in a proper Hermean-centric RF the corresponding equations\nof the satellite motion depend on Mercury\'s gravitational field only. This set of equations is well\nknown and widely in use for studying the dynamics of test bodies in the isolated gravitational onebody problem. The existence of the external gravitational field manifests itself in the form of the\ntidal forces only and also determines the dynamic properties of the constructed Hermean-centric\nproper RF. Note that within the accuracy expected for the future Mercury Orbiter mission, one\nmay completely neglect the post-Newtonian tidal terms. However, while constructing this RF,\nwe went further than the expected accuracy of the future experiments. Indeed, the last term\nin equation (7.14) is due to the coordinate transformation to the Fermi-normal-like RF, which\nmay be chosen in the planet\'s vicinity. One may neglect this term for the solar system motion;\nhowever, if one applies the presented formalism to the problems of motion with a more intensive\ngravitational environment, one will find that this term may play a significant role. The application of the results obtained here to the problems of motion of the double pulsars is currently\nunder study and will be reported elsewhere.\nIt should be noted at once that the coefficients in front of the two terms in the second line\nof the expression in eq.(7.14) prove the correctness of the decomposition of the local fields in the\nproper RF/i, which we performed at the end of section 4. Indeed, if even one of these terms had\nhad a non-zero value, this would have meant that the metric tensor of the local problem would\nnot depend on the external gravity through the relativistic tidal-like potential, which is of the\n/2\\\nsecond order with respect to the spatial coordinate ~ y\\ , but instead this dependence would\nbe at least of the order ~ y\\ . As a result, this new dependence may lead to a violation of\nthe Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). There are certainly no worries for the general theory\nof relativity for which the PPN parameters have the values 7 = /? = 1. However, the theories\nhaving a different means of 7 and /? may predict new effects in motion of the satellites due to\nthe corresponding SEP violation. At this point, we have all the necessary equations in order to\ndiscuss this and other gravitational experiments with the future Mercury Orbiter mission.\n\n7.3 Gravitational Experiment for Post-2000 Missions.\nMercury is the closest to the Sun of all the planets of the terrestrial group, and because of its\nunique location and orbital parameters, it is well suited to relativistic gravitational experiments.\nThe short period of its solar orbit allows experiments over several orbital revolutions, and its\nhigh eccentricity and inclination allow various effects to be well separated. In this section, we will\ndiscuss possible gravitational experiments for the Mercury Orbiter mission. Analysis performed\nin this section is directed toward the future mission, so we will show which relativistic effects\nmay be measured and how accurately.\nIt is generally considered that the processing of data from orbiters is more complicated than\nthat from landers. This is because of the need to convert from the measured Earth-spacecraft\ndistance to the desired Earth-planet distance. This involves determining the orbit of the space-\n\n107\n\ncraft about the planetary center of mass, which requires solving from the tracking data for a\nnumber of spatial harmonics of the gravitational field and for radiation pressure and other such\neffects. The other non-gravitational perturbations, such as firing attitude control jets, which\nhave unbalanced forces, are also frequently present, which further complicates the analysis. The\norbit determination of the Mariner P, for example, was substantially affected not only by these\nfactors, but also by the fact that the spacecraft was placed on the 12 hr period orbit with low\nperiapsis. Thus, in order to precisely describe the motion of the Mercury Orbiter relative to\nEarth, one should solve two problems, namely: (i) the problem of the satellite motion about\nMercury\'s center of inertia in the Hermean-centric frame, and (ii) the relative motion of both\nplanets\xe2\x80\x94Earth and Mercury\xe2\x80\x94in the solar system barycentric RFo- Our analysis is intended to-.\nprovide a complete solution of these two problems.\n;..,\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .\nIn order to study the relativistic effects in the motion of the Mercury Orbiter satellite, we\nseparate these effects into the three following groups:\n(i). The effects due to Mercury\'s motion with respect to the solar system barycentric RFo(ii). Effects on the satellite\'s motion with respect to the Hermean-centric RF.\n(iii). Effects due to the dragging of the inertial frames.\n\n, -\n\nThe effects of the first group are standard and, with the accuracy anticipated for the future\nMercury Orbiter mission, most of them may be obtained directly from the Lagrangian function\n(2.9) or from the equations of motion, (2.14)-(2.20). The effects of the second group can be\ndiscussed based on equations (7.14). And finally, the effects of the last group can be discussed\nbased on the coordinate transformation rules given by the eqs.(7.2). In the last case, however,\nwe employ a simplified version of these transformations, due to the limited expected accuracy\n(~ 1 m) of the Mercury ranging data. Thus, in the future discussion, we will use the following\nexpression for the temporal components:\n\nt\' -\n\nVAo\n\n+ <9(c-4),\n\n(7.15)\n\nwhere J^" represents the STF intrinsic quadrupole moments of the bodies. Note that the terms\ncontained in the function CA ~ 0(c~4) will contribute to the post-Newtonian redshift. However,\nit will not be possible to perform the redshift experiment with the accuracy anticipated for\nthe mission, and therefore this term was omitted. The corresponding expression for the spatial\ncomponents of the coordinate transformation is given by\n\n[ fy\xc2\xb0A\nJ\n\n108\n\n,\n\nwith the precession angular velocity tensor fi^ given as follows:\n\n(7.166)\nwhere 5^I/ is the STF intrinsic spin moment of the bodies.\nWe mention that, by means of a topographic Legendre expansion complete through the second degree and order, the systematic error in Mercury radar ranging has been reduced significantly (Anderson et al., 1995). However, a Mercury Orbiter is required before significant\nimprovements in relativity tests become possible. Currently, the precession rate of Mercury\'s\nperihelion, in excess of the 530 arcsec per century (" /cy) from planetary perturbations, is\n43,13 "/cy with a realistic standard error of 0.14 " /cy (Anderson et al., 1991). After taking\ninto account a small excess precession from solar oblateness, Anderson et al find that this result\nis consistent with general relativity. Pitjeva (1993) has obtained a similar result but with a\nsmaller estimated error of 0.052 "/cy. Similarly, attempts to detect a time variation in the gravitational constant G using Mercury\'s orbital motion have been unsuccessful, again consistent with\ngeneral relativity. The current result (Pitjeva, 1993) is G/G = (4.7 \xc2\xb14.7) x 10~12 yr"1.\n7.3.1\n\nMercury\'s Perihelion Advance.\n\nBased on Mercury\'s barycentric equations of motion, one may study the phenomenon of Mercury\'s perihelion advance. The secular trend in Mercury\'s perihelion14 depends on the linear\ncombination of the PPN parameters 7 and (3 and the solar quadrupole coefficient JZQ (Nobili &:\nWill, 1986; Heimberger et al, 1990; Will, 1993):\n-l),\n\n"/cy\n\n(7.17a)\n\nwhere aM-, n Mi^M-, and CM are the mean distance, mean motion, inclination, and eccentricity of\nMercury\'s orbit. The parameters /*0 and RQ are the solar gravitational constant and radius,\nrespectively. For Mercury\'s orbital parameters, one obtains\nn = 42"98 [|(2 + 27 - 0) + 0.296 \xe2\x80\xa2 J2Q x 104] , "/cy\n\n(7.176)\n\nThus, the accuracy of the relativity tests on the Mercury Orbiter mission will depend on our\nknowledge of the solar gravity field. The major source of uncertainty in these measurements is\nthe solar quadrupole moment J?Q. As evidenced by the oblateness of the photosphere (Brown et\nai, 1989) and perturbations in frequencies of solar oscillations, the internal structure of the Sun\nis slightly aspherical. The amount of this asphericity is uncertain. It has been suggested that\nit could be significantly larger than calculated for a simply rotating star and that the internal\nrotation rate varies with the solar cycle (Goode & Dziembowski, 1991). Solar oscillation data\nsuggest that most of the Sun rotates slightly slower than the surface with the possible exception\nof a more rapidly rotating core (Duvall &; Harvey, 1984). An independent measurement of\n14\nIt should be noted that the Mercury Orbiter itself, being placed in orbit around Mercury, will experience the\nphenomenon of periapse advance as well. However, we expect that uncertainties in Mercury\'s gravity field will\nmask the relativistic precession, at least at the level of interest for ruling out alternative gravitational theories.\n\n109\n\nperformed with the Mercury Orbiter would provide a valuable direct confirmation of the indirect\nhelioseismology value (2 \xc2\xb1 0.2) x 10~7. Furthermore, there are suggestions of a rapidly rotating\ncore, but helioseismology determinations are limited by uncertainties at depths below 0.4 solar\nradius (Libbrecht & Woodard, 1991).\nThe Mercury Orbiter will help us understand this asphericity and independently will enable\nus to gain some important data on the properties of the solar interior and the features of its\nrotational motion. Preliminary analysis of a Mercury Orbiter mission suggests that JZQ would be\nmeasurable to at best ~ 10~9 (Ashby et al., 1995) or about 1% of the expected J%Q value. This\nshould be compared with the present 10% solar oscillation determination (Brown et al., 1989).\n7.3.2\n\nThe Redshift Experiment.\n\nAnother important experiment that could be performed on a Mercury Orbiter mission is a test\nof the solar gravitational redshift. This would require that a stable frequency standard be flown\non the spacecraft. The experiment would provide a fundamental test of the theory of general\nrelativity and the Equivalence Principle upon which it and other metric theories of gravity are\nbased (Will, 1993). Because in general relativity the gravitational redshift of an oscillator or\nclock depends upon its proximity to a massive body (or more precisely the size of the Newtonian,\npotential at its location), a frequency standard at the location of Mercury would experience \'\na large, measurable redshift due to the Sun. With the result for the function K,A given by\neqs. (7.2a) and (7.15) in hand, one can obtain the corresponding Newtonian proper frequency\nvariation between the barycentric standard of time and that of the satellite (the terms with\nmagnitude up to 10~12), given as\n+ 0(cT4),\n\n(7.18a)\n\nwhere 0/(m,y(o)) are *^e ^our coorcunates of the spacecraft in the Hermean-centric RF and V(\nis the spacecraft orbital velocity. One can see that the eccentricity of Mercury\'s orbit would be\nhighly effective in varying the solar potential at the clock, thereby producing a distinguishing\nsignature in the redshift. The anticipated frequency variation between perihelion and aphelion\nis to the first order in eccentricity:\n.\n\nJO \'eM\n\n(7.186)\n\nThis contribution is quite considerable and is calculated to be (<5///o)eM = 1-1 x 10~8. Its\nmagnitude, for instance, at a radio wavelength AQ = 3 cm (/o = 10 GHz) is (Sf}&M = 110 Hz.\nWe would also benefit from the short orbital period of Mercury, which would permit the redshift\nsignature of the Sun to be measured several times over the duration of the mission. If the\nspacecraft tracking and modelling are of sufficient precision to determine the spacecraft position\nrelative to the Sun to 100 m (a conservative estimate), then a frequency standard with 10~15\nfractional frequency stability Sf/f = 10~15 would be able to measure the redshift to 1 part in\n107 or better. This stability is within the capability of the proposed spaceborne trapped-ion\n(Prestage et al, 1992) or H-maser clocks (Vessot et a/., 1980; Walsworth et al, 1994).\n7.3.3\n\nThe SEP Violation Effect.\n\nBesides the Nordtvedt effect (for more details see Anderson, Turyshev et al. (1996)), there exists\nan interesting possibility for testing the SEP violation effect by studying spacecraft motion in\n110\n\norbit around Mercury. The corresponding equation of motion is given by eq.(7.14). As one\ncan see, the two terms in the second line of this equation vanish for general relativity, but for\nscalar-tensor theories, they become responsible for small deviations of the spacecraft motion from\nthe support geodesic. Both of these effects, if they exist, are due to non-linear coupling of the\ngravitational field of Mercury to external gravity. They come from the expression for WA given\nby eq.(7.5a), which is the local post-Newtonian contribution to the poo component of the metric\ntensor in the proper RF.\nThe first of these terms may be interpreted as a dependence of the locally measured gravitational constant on the external gravitational environment and may be expressed in the vicinity\nof body (A) as follows:\n\nGA = Go [l - (4/3 - 87 - 1) \xc2\xa3 -^-]\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(7.19)\n\nIn the case of a satellite around Mercury, the main contribution to this effect comes from the\nSun.15 Because of the high eccentricity of Mercury\'s orbit, the periodic changing of the Sun\'s local\ngravitational potential may produce an observable effect, which can be modeled by a periodic\ntime variation in the effective local gravitational constant:\n(7.20)\nwhich gives the following estimate for this effect on Mercury\'s orbit:\n[VI\n\nL(jJ period\n\n~ (4/3-37 - 1) x 1-52 x lQ- 7 sm<f>(t)\n\nyr"1.\n\n(7.21)\n\nNote that this effect in eq.(7.21) is fundamentally different from that introduced by Dirac\'s\nhypothesis of possible time dependence of the gravitational constant (Pitjeva, 1993). As one\ncan see from expression (7.21), the characteristic time in this case is Mercury\'s siderial period.\nThis short period may be considered as an advantage from the experimental point of view. In\naddition, the results of the redshift experiment could help in confident studies of this effect.\nRecently a different combination of the post-Newtonian parameters entering in the Nordtvedt\neffect, 77 = 4/3\xe2\x80\x947\xe2\x80\x943, was measured at r\\ < 10~4 (Dickey et al., 1994). This means that, in order to\nobtain comparable accuracy for the combination of parameters in eq.(7.21), one should perform\nthe Mercury gravimetric measurements on a level no less precise than [G/G]period \xc2\xab 10~u yr"1.\nRecently a group at the University of Colorado analyzed a number of gravitational experiments\npossible with future Mercury missions (Ashby et al, 1995). Using a modified worst-case error\nanalysis, this group suggests that after one year of ranging between Earth and Mercury (and\nassuming a 6 cm rms error), the fractional accuracy of determination of the Sun\'s gravitational\nconstant, m0G, is expected to be of the order ~ 2.1 x 10"11. Moreover, even higher accuracy\ncould be achieved with a Mercury lander as proposed by Ashby et al. (1995). This suggests\nthat the experiment for determination of the effect in eq.(7.21) may be feasible with the Mercury\nOrbiter mission.\n15\n\nNote that this combination of PPN parameters differs from the one presented for a similar effect in (Will, 1993).\nThe reason for this is that, in this case, the transformations in the form of eqs.(7.2) let us define transformation\nrules of the metric tensor between the barycentric and proper planeto-centric RFs and, hence, obtain the correct\nand complete equations of geodesic motion in the quasi-inertial Hermean-centric RFM-\n\n111\n\nAnother interesting effect on the satellite\'s orbit may be derived from eq.(7.14) in the form\nof the following acceleration term:\n6a(0}SEP = 2(/3 - i) K\n\nyM\n\n(NM - n(n \xe2\x80\xa2 NM)),\n\n(7.22)\n\nwhere RM is Mercury\'s heliocentric radius vector and NM is the unit vector along this direction.\nThis effect is very small for the orbit proposed for the ESA\'s Mercury Orbiter mission. However,\none can show that there exist two resonant orbits for a satellite around Mercury, either with\nthe orbital frequency u^ equal to Mercury\'s siderial frequency MM, ^(o) ~ ^M, or at one-third\nof this frequency, o>(0) ~ wjw/3. For these resonant orbits, the corresponding experiment could\'\nprovide an independent direct test of the parameter /3.\n7.3.4\n\nThe Precession Phenomena.\n\nIn addition to the perihelion advance, while constructing the Hermean proper RF^, one should\ntake into account several precession phenomena included in transformation function 0% and\nassociated with the angular momentum of the bodies. As one may see directly from eqs.(7.2&) and\n(7.16a), besides the obvious special relativistic contributions, the post-Newtonian transformation.\nof the spatial coordinates contains terms due to the non-perturbative influence of the gravitational:\nfield. This non-Lorentzian behavior of the post-Newtonian transformations was discussed first\nby Chandrasekhar &: Contopulos (1967) for the case of post-Galilean transformations. Our\nderivations differ from the latter by taking into account the acceleration of the proper RF and\nby including the infinitesimal precession of the coordinate axes with the angular velocity tensor\n&M giyen as follows:\n=\n\n\xc2\xa3\n(7-23)\n\nwhere, as before, the subscript (M) stands for Mercury and summation is performed over the\nbodies of the solar system. This expression rederives and generalizes the result for the precession\nof the spin of a gyroscope SQ attached to a test body orbiting a gravitating primary. Previously\nthis result was obtained from the theory of the Fermi-Walker transport (Will, 1993). Indeed,\nin accord with eq.(7.16a), this spin (or coordinate axes of a proper Hermean RFM) will precess\nwith respect to a distant standard of rest, such as quasars or distant galaxies. The motion of the\nspin vector of a gyroscope can be described by the relation\n= [JTM x so].\n\n(7.24)\n\nBy keeping the leading contributions only and neglecting the influence of Mercury\'s intrinsic spin\nmoment, we obtain from expression (7.23) the angular velocity &M in the following form:\n= (7 +\n\n1)jj-[RM\n\n-n-M\n\nx VMO] - (7 + l ) - r [\xc2\xabM x VQ]+\n\n-\xc2\xab-M\n\n+ ( 7+ 1 ) - S 0 - 3 ( S N M ) N M ,\n\n112\n\n(7.25)\n\nwhere VMO and VQ are Mercury\'s and the Sun\'s barycentric orbital velocities and SQ is the solar\nintrinsic spin moment.\nThe first term in eq.(7.25) is known as geodetic precession (De-Sitter, 1916). This term arises\nin any non- homogeneous gravitational field because of the parallel transport of a direction defined\nby SQ in (7.24). It can be viewed as spin precession caused by a coupling between the particle\nvelocity VMO and the static part of the space-time geometry. For Mercury orbiting the Sun, this\nprecession has the form\n&G = (7 + \\}jj-(RM x vMo).\n2 K\nM\n\n(7.26)\n\nThis effect could be studied for the Mercury Orbiter, which, being placed in orbit around Mercury,\nis in effect a gyroscope orbiting the Sun. Thus, if we introduce the angular momentum per unit\nmass, L = RM x VMO, of Mercury in solar orbit, equation (7.26) shows that QG is directed along\nthe pole of the ecliptic, in the direction of L. The vector S^G has a constant part\nn0 = 1(1 +\n2,\n\n27)\n\n(LM\n\n=\n\n. 0.205 "/yr,\n\n6\n\n(1.110)\n\nwith a significant correction due to the eccentricity &M of Mercury\'s orbit:\nfiieosuMt = -(l + 2-y) fJ " 3UJM e M cosu M to=\n2\n\ndM\n\n"t\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 0.126 cos uMto "/yr,\n\n(7.276)\n\nwhere U>M is Mercury\'s siderial frequency, to is reckoned from a perihelion passage, and au is\nthe semimajor axis of Mercury\'s orbit.\nGeodetic precession has been studied for the motion of lunar perigee, and its existence was\nfirst confirmed with an accuracy of 10% (Bertotti et al., 1987). Two other groups have analyzed\nthe lunar laser-ranging data more completely to estimate the deviation of the lunar orbit from the\npredictions of general relativity (Shapiro et al., 1988; Dickey et al., 1989). Geodetic precession\nhas been confirmed within a standard deviation of 2%. The precession of the orbital plane\nproposed for the ESA\'s Mercury Orbiter (periherm at 400 km altitude, apherm at 16,800 km,\nperiod of 13.45 hr, and latitude of periherm at +30 deg) would include a contribution on the\norder of 0.205 "/yr from the geodetic precession. We recommend this precession be included in\nfuture studies of the Mercury Orbiter mission.\nThe third term in expression (43) is known as Lense-Thirring precession, &LT- This term gives\nthe relativistic precession of the gyroscope\'s spin, SQ, caused by the intrinsic angular momentum\nS of the central body. This effect is responsible for a small perturbation in the orbits of artificial\nsatellites around the Earth (Tapley et al., 1972; Ries et al, 1991). However, our preliminary\nstudies indicate that this effect is so small for the satellite\'s orbit around Mercury that will be\nmasked by uncertainties in the orbit\'s inclination.\n\n113\n\n8\n\nDiscussion: Relativistic Astronomical RFs.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss some questions of the practical application of the results presented\nin this report. Let us mention that presently radio sources seem to be able to provide one\nwith the more stable and precise reference measurements needed for reliable navigation in outer\nspace. This makes it reasonable to construct the future astronomical RFs based upon the radio\nsource catalogues that are expected to be an essential part of future relativistic navigation in\nthe solar system and beyond (Standish, 1995). Moreover, as we know, the accuracy of VLBI\ntiming measurements has improved rapidly over the last few years and is presently a few tens\nof picoseconds (ps). It is important in precise measurements such as these that inadequate\nmodelling not contribute to the inaccuracy of the results. We believe that the results obtained\nin this report are ready to be used directly in application to this and many other problems of\nrelativistic observations in the solar system.\nThe KLQ parameterized theory of astronomical RFs discussed in this report enables one to\nperform the necessary calculations in the most arbitrary form valid for many theories of gravity.\nThe different physical aspects of choosing a well-defined local RF in a curved space-time has been\ndiscussed in many publications. In summary, in modern astronomical practice there are two\nphysically different types of relativistic RFs that are extensively in use, namely:\n1. The set of inertia! RFs, which includes\n(i). The asymptotic inertial RF.\n(ii). The barycentric inertial RF.\n2. The set of the observer\'s quasi-inertial proper RFs, which consists of\n(i). The bodycentric RF, constructed for a particular extended body in the system.\n(ii). The satellite RF, defined on the geodetic world line of a test particle orbiting the body\nunder consideration.\n(iii). The topocentric RF, which is defined on the surface of the body under study.\nThe main difference between these two classes of RFs is that, unlike the frames of the first\ntype, which are inertial, the observer\'s frame is, in general, non-inertial. Such a hierarchy of\nframes in the WFSMA, if needed, may be extended to a larger scale of motion. The barycentric\nRFo could also be used (with some cosmological assumptions) as an analog of the rest frame\nof the universe for the description of the galactic and extra-galactic motion. One may find a\nmore detailed discussion of this hierarchy of the RFs in applications to problems of modern\nastronomical practice in (Brumberg, 1991; Voinov, 1994; Folkner et al, 1994). Theoretically, the\nRF and the set of coordinates selected may be arbitrary. The relativistic terms in the equations\nof motion, the light time equations, and the transformation from coordinate time to physically\nmeasurable time will vary with the RF and coordinates selected. In general, the numerical values\nof various constants, obtained by fitting the theory to observations, will also vary. However,\nthe numerical values of the computed observable are independent of the RF and the CS selected\n(Moyer, 1971).\nWhile the properties of inertial RFs from the first set of the frames listed above are well\nunderstood and widely accepted in many areas of modern astronomical practice, below we shall\n115\n\nconcentrate our attention on the properties of the relativistic RFs from the second set, namely,\nwe will be interested in construction of the geocentric, the satellite, and the topocentric frames.\nThe logic of construction of these frames is quite simple: Due to the fact that the geocentric\nframe was previously well justified physically and explicitly constructed from the mathematical\nstandpoint, the construction of the two remaining frames will be made based on these established\nproperties of the geocentric RF. Indeed, the proper RF^ of an extended body (A) contains all the\ninformation about the proper gravitational field of the body (A) as well as the explicit information\nabout the external gravity. Then, considering that the properties of the geocentric RF are already\nknown, we will give the definitions of the satellite and the topocentric RFs. Moreover, we will\npresent the results generalized on the case of the scalar-tensor theories of gravity and will include\nin the analysis the two Eddington parameters (7,/?)-\n\n8.1 The Geocentric Proper RF.\nThe properties of construction of the geocentric RF were discussed in Section 6 of the present\nreport, and below we will present the final results only. Thus, the form of the coordinate transformations between the coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFo and those (y^) of a proper\nquasi-inertial RF^ of an arbitrary body (A) for the problem of motion of the N-extended-body\nsystem in the WFSMA was obtained as follows:\n\n) + O(c^}.\n\n(8.16)\n\nWe will present the results corresponding to the coordinate transformations to the RF, which\nhas all ten parameters \xc2\xa3 A ,ff A and f^ of the constructed group of motion vanish and which is\ngiven by eq.(5.44) as\na\n\na\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e<*\nf@\nn\nn\xe2\x80\x941/-A , \xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x94 4,*.A\n= C Cl + C C2 = \xc2\xb0A = /A = \xc2\xb0-\n\nMoreover, we shall be interested in such RFs that preserve all ten existing conservation laws of\nthe local gravity, inertia, and matter, so that we require that the conditions of eqs.(6.37) hold,\nnamely:\n\nVZ>3.\nWith these conditions, the transformation functions KA, Q^, and LA take the following form:\n(8.2o)\n\n=7\n\n-^\n\n(8.26)\n\n116\n\n\xc2\xb0AM= E (-y|\n\nE (%) x - 2(7+ 1) E\n^A\n\nB^A\n\n[ E <WB}A + \\( E {%)A - U0/Xo)2 + *>+> A CO] + 0(c-6)y\xc2\xb0A.\n\n(8.2c)\n\n^\n\nThe equations for the functions a^ and WAO were given previously by equations (7.3) and (6.52),\nrespectively.\nThe transformations, eqs.(8.2), produce the metric tensor g^n of the geocentric RF with the\nfollowing components:\n0(c-6),\n(8.3o)\n(c-5),\n\n(8.36)\n\n0(c-4),\n\n(8.3c)\n\nwhere for the brevity of the future discussion we introduced the following notations for the\ngeneralized gravitational potentials in this local frame:\n\n- E yAj\n\n+ (U B } A ,\n\n(8.4a)\n\nB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2AoA<,-(27-l)a*\n\n9\n\n+ E \xc2\xa3D-(^^CT<%> ,-(7 + l)[(5(^B/3)) +(v ( ^U B ) I) ],\n\n\'A;\n\n/\n\nwhere both functions W/i and WB are given by the expressions of eqs.(7.5).\n\n117\n\n(8.46)\n\nThe expressions presented for the geocentric proper RF take into account the proper gravitational field of the body (A), the external gravity, and the dynamical properties of the inertial\nsector of the local space-time. This presentation of the local metric, eqs.(8.3), will enable us to\nsimplify the discussion of the results obtained for the two other important quasi-inertial frames\nthat are widely in use for many practical applications of modern astronomy\xe2\x80\x94the satellite and\nthe topocentric ones.\n\n8.2\n\nThe Satellite Proper RF.\n\nThe motion of an artificial satellite may be presented as the motion of a test particle that is\nmoving along the geodetic world line in the effective space-time with the metric tensor given\nby eqs.(8.3). This means that, in order to define the coordinate transformations and the metric\ntensor of a satellite RF(o)> we can aPply *ne conditions of eqs.(3.26) or those of eqs.(5.2). By\nperforming the same calculations as in Section 5 for the test particle, we can obtain the postNewtonian dynamically non-rotating coordinate transformations linking together the coordinates\n(y^) of the geocentric quasi-inertial RP^ and those (zp) of the proper quasi-inertial RF(o)- These.\ntransformations may be obtained in the familiar form:\ny\xc2\xb0A = z\xc2\xb0 + c-2K(0}(z\xc2\xb0, zv] + c-4L(0)(z\xc2\xb0, z\xc2\xa3) + O(<T V,\nyaA = z\xc2\xb0 + *?0)(*\xc2\xb0) + c ~ 2 Qfo)(*\xc2\xb0> *") + 0(c-V.\n\n(8.5a)\n(8.56)\n\nThe solutions for the transformation functions K( 0 ),Q?y, and L(0) were chosen with the same\nconditions as those for the functions of eqs.(8.2), namely: the corresponding group parameters\nC(o)>\xc2\xb0"(o) and /^? are taken to be zero and the requirement of preserving all the conservation\nlaws in the satellite\'s local vicinity is fulfilled. The resultant functions were obtained as follows:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 *" + 0(<r V,\n\n(8.6a)\n\n(8.66)\n\n0(c-6),\xc2\xb0,\n\n(8.6c)\n\nwhere the quantities vfa and a9Q-, are the geocentric velocity and acceleration of the spacecraft,\nrespectively. The notation //)\n\n, analogously to that of eq.(5.7), denotes the limiting procedure\n\nof taking the value of the function f(zp} on the geodetic world line of an artificial satellite, where\nza \xe2\x80\x94> 0. The equations for both time-dependent functions z/jU and wfa may be determined\n\n118\n\nsimilarly to those presented in Section 5. Thus, eq.(5.4) provides us with the usual relation for\nthe Newtonian acceleration a^ of the center of inertia of a test body:\n\n. f\xc2\xbb /.\n\n,n, + 0(c~4).\n\n(8.7)\n\nAnalogously, the function w?Q is determined as the solution of the equation below:\n\nwhere function 7\xc2\xa3 ~ O(c~4) is denned in the same way as functions WA and WB in eqs.(5.43)\nfrom the result of the fields decomposition in the local quasi-inertial RF(0) of a satellite. By\nrepeating this decomposition as it was presented in Section 4, one may obtain this function as\nfollows:\nttOO = W(**) + 2af0) \xc2\xa3 J^XB(Z\xc2\xb0, *") + 0(c-6).\n(8.86)\nB \xc2\xb0Z\n\nAt this point, we may present the form of the metric tensor in the proper RF(0) of an artificial\nsatellite defined on the geodetic world line with the generalized Fermi conditions (3.26). Thus,\nby substituting the solutions obtained for functions K^ , Qfa , and L(0) into the general form\nof the metric tensor gmn(zp} in the expressions for the metric in a proper RF(0) given by the\nrelations in eqs.(4.11), we will obtain this tensor in the following form:\n+ 0(cr6),\n\n(8.9o)\n\nc-5),\n\n(8.96)\n\n0(c-4).\n\n(8.9c)\n\nExpressions (8.9) are the general solution for the field equations of the general theory of relativity,\nwhich satisfy the generalized Fermi conditions in the immediate vicinity of a dimensionless test\nbody. By definition, the proper gravity of the test body is negligibly small, then the effective\nNewtonian potential in the vicinity of the satellite may be presented as follows:\n\nIn addition, functions 7\xc2\xa3(o) and V(0) were obtained in the following form:\na (0)A afo)\n\n-(27 - 1)0(0)^(0)0 + 0-fl (\'W/tfaTo\n\nand\n/Q\n\n\' )\n\n\\+"f~\\zazp\ng\n\n/(o)J\n(0)J\n\n119\n\n4V\n\n6\'aZ,,z>J\'}dl\n\n2 P ** J <\n\n8.3 The Topocentric Proper RF.\nThe construction of the topocentric RF requires a little bit more sophisticated analysis. Thus, we\nhave to specify where this frame is located on the surface of the extended body and what point will\nbe considered as the origin of the coordinates. In order to find the dynamical conditions necessary\nfor construction of the transformation functions (analogous to those given by eqs.(3.26)-(3.29)),\none should make an explicit relativistic analysis of the constrained motion of the tracking station\nplaced on the Earth\'s surface. This analysis should provide one with a detailed description of\nthe problem of static equilibrium of a test particle on the surface of an extended body whose\ninterior is characterized by the energy-momentum tensor Tmn and the corresponding equation\nof state p(p). It is likely that the present accuracy of the topocentric radio-metric measurements\ndoes not require this level of generality. This permits us to neglect the geometry of the tracking\nstation and its weight, and instead, to consider the law of relativistic motion of an atomic time\nstandard only. Then the answer to the second part of the above question is simple: the origin\nof the coordinates of the topocentric RF coincides with the atomic time standard that is used\nas the physically measurable time r. The world line of the clocks may be considered as the.\ngeodetic line of the massless test particle. This suggests that, in order to find the form of the\ncorresponding coordinate transformation functions, one can apply the same generalized Fermi\nconditions (3.26).\nAs a result, the general form of the coordinate transformations between the coordinates\nof the geocentric RFA and those (Cp) = (r, \xc2\xa3") of a topocentric one in the WFSMA may be\npresented as follows:\ny\xc2\xb0A = r + c-*KSo(r, C\xc2\xa3) + c^LSo(r, O + O(c~6},\n\n(8.13o)\n\nyaA = C + ao(r) + c-2Qg0(r, Ce) + 0(c-4),\n\n(8.136)\n\nwhere we, as before, have neglected the associated group parameters C5\xc2\xb0; \xc2\xb0s0\' an<^ fso an<^ require\nthat the constructed frame should preserve all the conservation laws in its immediate vicinity.\nThe transformation functions KSO, Q^, and LSO in this case will take the following form:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 C" + 0(c-4)r,\n\n(8.14a)\n\n(8.146)\n\n-4\n+\n\n\\((U}S> ~ \\V^A}2 + V^A]\n\n120\n\n+ 0(c-6)r,\n\n(8.14c)\n\nwhere the new quantities Vgo and a^Q are the geocentric velocity and acceleration of a particular\npoint So on the surface of an extended body under question. The notation (/}\nreflects that\n\\ /So\nthis quantity was denned in a particular point, SQ, on the surface, SA, of an extended body (A).\nThe Newtonian acceleration of the clock with respect to the geocentric RF^ is given as\n\n<&\xc2\xab--\n\nrd^-KXO-\n\n(8.15)\n\nFurthermore, the function w^0 is determined as the solution of the following differential equation:\n\nSo\n\n\xc2\xb0\\\n\nS0\n\ndr\\\n\nSo\n\nwhere the function Z ~ C?(c~4) was denned similarly to the function 7\xc2\xa3 from eqs.(8.86):\n+ 2<4 2 ~XB(r^ C) + 0(c~6).\n\n(8.17)\n\nAs a result, the components of the metric tensor g^\xc2\xb0n in the coordinates (\xc2\xa3p) = (r, ^") of the\ntopocentric RF take the following form:\nSoo (Cp) = 1 - 2i75o + 2ZSo + 0(c-6),\nc-5),\n0(c-4).\n\n(8.18a)\n(8.186)\n(8.18c)\n\nThe obtained expressions, (8.18), represent the general solution for the field equations of the\ngeneral relativity on the surface of an extended body in the WFSMA. The effective Newtonian\npotential in the vicinity of the antenna may be presented as follows:\n\nThe functions ZSQ and VSo were obtained in the following form:\n\n+ (R) J + i<"\n-(27= V(r. O - [C"{|^)So + < V) J + 7!\n\n121\n\nIt should be stressed that more detailed analysis is necessary for the final solution of the\nproblem of relativistic astronomical measurements performed from the topocentric RF. However,\nwe believe that the presented general approach, incorporated in the new formalism, enables\none to construct the topocentric proper reference frame with well-defined physical properties.\nMoreover, the accuracy of the theoretical expressions obtained here is far beyond that achieved\nin real astronomical practice. This suggests that the presented formulae could be used for quite\na long time before practical needs will require theoreticians to reconsider the presented results\nin order to achieve higher accuracy of the physical modelling of the relativistic measurements.\n\n8.4\n\nDiscussion.\n\nIt is generally understood that any RF is not a physical substance but rather a conventional\nartifact. The main reason we need RFs is that they are convenient in exchanging the observational\ndata and one\'s discoveries and opinions, which are the starting points in doing scientific research.\nIn this sense, the most important character of the RF is that it is widely accepted and is related\nclearly with the other existing references. In addition, it is desirable to represent the actual\nphenomenon precisely. If the first point is respected, what we should do in these days of an\nadvanced electronic/computational environment is to move toward standardization, which never\nmeans the exclusion of other points of view. Rather it should be understood as only a scale that\nenables us to express observation/theoretical quantities in a concise manner.\nAn application of atomic frequency standards is the establishment of atomic time scales.\nInternational Atomic Time is the official basis by which events are dated. However, the need to\ndistinguish between theoretical times and their realizations, the need for a relativistic treatment,\nand the survival of previous astronomical times generate a complex situation. Specific problems\nraised by time scales and the relationships they have with one another and with the successive\ndefinitions of seconds in different RFs should be examined in more detail. Thus, currently\nemployed definitions of ephemeris astronomy and the system of astronomical constants are based\non Newtonian mechanics with its absolute time and absolute space. To avoid any relativistic\nambiguities in applying new IAU (1991) resolutions on RFs and time scales, one should specify\nthe astronomical constructions and definitions of constants to make them consistent with general\nrelativity. However, up to this time, the VSOP theories of the motion of the planets were\nconstructed on the base of integration of Lagrange\'s differential equations (Brumberg et al.,\n1993). The development of the perturbative function included the mutual perturbations of the\nbodies and was performed up to the third order of the perturbative masses using the Newtonian\nperturbative function. The relativistic contributions to the equations of motion were limited to\nthe Schwarzschild problem. The accuracy reached by such solutions is only a few mas for the\ninner planets and less for the outer ones. Due to the fact that the present astrometric accuracies\nhave reached the mas level, the mutual relativistic perturbations of the planets must be included\nin the ephemeris constructions.\nIn this report, we addressed these and other problems of modern astronomy and have presented the theoretical foundation necessary for conducting relativistic measurements in curved\nspace-time in the WFSMA. Our approach naturally incorporates the general properties of the\ndynamical RF into the hierarchy of the relativistic RFs and the time scales. Moreover, we obtained the new relation between the time scales, which was obtained to the fourth order in 1/c,\nc being the velocity of light in a vacuum. The accuracy of these expressions is at the ps level,\nwhich is the future requirement in many different applications. Thus, this formulation leads\nto improved relations between barycentric and geocentric quantities. These expressions will be\n122\n\nuseful in converting the numerical values of some astronomical constants determined in the old\nIAU time scale to new scales. The obtained results naturally contain exhaustive information\nabout the multipolar structure of the gravitational field in the N-body system and enable one to\nmodel the experimental situation with very high accuracy. Because of this, we anticipate that\nthe results presented in this report may be immediately applied in the following important areas\nof modern astronomy and astrophysics:\n(i). Precise VLBI timing measurements,\n(ii). Precise radiometric navigation of future space missions and the corresponding data analysis.\n(iii). More precise analysis of the binary system dynamics, including modelling of the coalescing\nexperiments and studies of the gravitational wave physics.\nLet us mention that there are some problems that remain to be solved. It is known that\nthe rotational motion of extended bodies in general relativity is a complicated problem that has\nno satisfactory solution up to now. Moreover, modern observational accuracy of geodynamical\nobservations makes it necessary to have a rigorous relativistic model of Earth\'s rotation. The\ncurrently employed solution for the Earth\'s rotation problem is valid for restricted intervals of\ntime. Moreover, there is an urgent necessity to elaborate a theory of nutation-precession matching the accuracy of very modern techniques, such as VLBI and LLR. To do this, one would have\nto model the transfer function leading to theoretical determination of the nutation coefficients\nwhen including predominant geophysical characteristics (elastic mantle, coupling at core-mantle i\nboundary, free core nutation, free inner core nutation, etc.). Furthermore, reductions of measurements included relativistic corrections, effects of propagation of electromagnetic signals in the\nEarth\'s troposphere and in the solar corona with simultaneous evaluation of the parameters of\nthe corona model from general fitting. The presented formalism provides one with the necessary\nbasis for studying this problem from very general positions and could serve as the foundation for\nfuture theoretical analysis.\nAs a result, an astronomical reference system may be defined as a set of the transformation\nfunctions and constants including the physically well-defined set of RFs and their mutual relationships, time arguments, ephemerides, and the standard constants and algorithms. The extragalactic, or radio, RF will be the basic frame for the development of the future ephemeris (Standish,\n1995). Achieving milli- to micro-arcsecond accuracies at optical wavelengths will reduce the\ndisparity between optical, radar, and radio RF determinations. Thus, the relationships and identifications of common sources should be much more accurate. Another significant change should\nbe the ability to determine distances and, thus, space motions on a three-dimensional basis,\nrather than the current two-dimensional basis of proper motions. Improvements in ephemerides\nprovide the opportunity to investigate the difference between atomic and dynamical time, the\nrelationship between the dynamical and extragalactic RF, and the values of precession and nutation. Also, the relationships between the bright and faint optical catalogs, the infrared, and\nthe extragalactic RFs should be better determined. The theory of relativistic astronomical RFs\npresented in this report was developed in order to serve exactly the above-mentioned needs, and\nit will be used the future analysis of these problems of fundamental importance.\n\n123\n\nIn order to accomplish these goals, our future efforts will be directed to finalizing the transcription of the results obtained on the language of the practical applications. We will establish\nthe necessary relativistic measurement models and will implement these results into existing\ncomputer software codes, as well as performing detailed analysis of the real data from the space\ngravitational experiments. The analysis of the above-mentioned problems from the new positions\nof the presented theory of relativistic astronomical RFs will be the subject for specific studies\nand future publications.\n\n124\n\nAppendix A: Generalized Gravitational Potentials.\nThe generalized gravitational potentials for the non-radiative problems in the WFSMA are given\nin Will (1993) as\n_ f <*Vpo(\n~J\n\n\\zv_z,\n\nA(z") =\n\n*(zP)\n\n= -(7\n\nwhere the other potentials axe given as follows\n\nIn order to indicate the functional dependence in the potentials introduced above, we have used\nthe following notation: (zp) = (z\xc2\xb0, z"). Then for any function /, one will have /(zp) = /(z\xc2\xb0, z")\n\n125\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nAppendix B: Power Expansions of the General Geometric\nQuantities.\nIn this appendix, we will present the expansion of some physical quantities with respect to powers\nof the small parameter c"1. We will use these expansions for linearizing the gravitational field\nequations of the metric theories of gravity in the WFSMA.\nB.I. Expansion for the Metric Tensor gmn.\nThe post-Newtonian expansion for the metric tensor gmn with respect to the powers of the small\nparameter c~l in the coordinates (zp) of an arbitrary RF (either a barycentric inertial RFo or a\nproper RF>i non-inertial one) may be presented as follows:\nO(c~^\n\n90* = c-3g\xc2\xa3> + c-5gg> + 0(c-7),\nO(c~6),\n\n(Bla)\n\n(Bib)\n(Blc)\n\nwhere 7a/j is the spatial part of the background metric 7mn- The notations g^^t (k = 1, 2, 3...)\nat the right-hand side of expressions (Bl) are the terms of the expansion of gmn with the order\nof magnitude ek ~ c~ k , respectively. In some calculations, we will omit the multipliers c~k in\norder to achieve brevity in the expressions. It should be noted that reversing the sign of the time\nz\xc2\xb0 \xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xbb \xe2\x80\x94 z\xc2\xb0 corresponds to the change of the sign of the small parameter e. Because of this, in the\nexpressions for poo (Bla) and gap (Blc), only the terms with even powers of the small parameter\nc-1 have been taken into account, and in the expressions for <?oa (Bib), only the odd ones are\nused. The fact that in expression (Bib) the term g^^ is absent is quite natural. Indeed, even\nthe main expansion for goa (Newtonian) should not be less than the second order with respect\nto the small parameter c~l (Will, 1993). In our further calculations, we will not be investigating\nthe processes of generating the gravitational waves by the system of astronomical bodies, so our\nexpressions for the component 500 in expressions (.61), do not contain the term of order O(c~5).\nHowever, one may easily reconstruct all the calculations to account for this term as well.\nB.2. Expansion for the det [gmn] and gmn.\nIn some calculations, we will need the relations for the determinant of the metric tensor g =\ndet\\g mn ] and the inverse metric g mn .

Expansion for the gmn = ^Pggmn.\nFor some practical applications, we will need the expansions for the components of density of\nthe metric tensor gmn = ^/:::ggmn as well. One may easily obtain those from the expressions of\neqs.(52)-(.B4) in the following form:\ng\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 = l + g<2>0\xc2\xb0 + y<4>0\xc2\xb0 + 0(c-6),\n\nwith the components of gmn given as\n-<2>oo _ .,<2>oo ,\n9\n\xe2\x80\x949\n+ r-\n\n-<3>0a _\n\n<3>0a\n\n-<5>0a _\n\n_\n\na\ni?\n\n<5>0a , \\ <3>0a 4<2>\n\n,\nO\n\nIn expressions (556), we have introduced the following notations:\n\n128\n\nn\n\n9oo\nn\n\n5oo\n\nn <2>\n\xe2\x80\x94 9n ~ 522 ~ 533\n\n_ n<4>\n\n9n\n\n+51<i2>52f> + 5if ^\nl2\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 522\n\n~ 533\n\n+ 52<22>53f>,,\n\nl3\n\n/DCN\n(Bo)\n\n- 523\n\nB.4.

The relations of eqs.(B5)-(B6) enable one to find the expressions\nfor linearized gauge conditions (Bib}. Thus, for n = 0, we will have\n75\n\n- 5o1,2>) - -T *\np\n\n) = 0(c-5).\n\n(B7c)\n\n) = 0(c-4),\n\n(Bid]\n\nFor n = a, we will obtain\n\np\n\nwhere 7%l(z ) is the components of the Christoffel symbols with respect to the Riemann-flat\nnon-inertial background metric 7mn(.zp) in coordinates (zp). One may easily see that for any noninertial RF these components may produce a non-vanishing contribution to the gauge conditions\n(B7). This property will be of use in order to write the field equations in an arbitrary RF.\nB.5. Expansion of the Christoffel Symbols.\nOne could easily find the expansion of the connection components F^n with respect to the small\nparameter c"1 and present those in terms of expansions <?mn> \xe2\x80\xa2 Thus, defining F^,n as usual:\n\n129\n\nwhere dn = d/dzn in coordinates (zp) of an arbitrary RF from the relations\nwe will have the following expressions for the components of the Christoffel symbols with respect\nto the powers of the small parameter c"1:\n\n+ O(c~\\\n\n(B8a)\n,\n\n9<2>a^g^> + 0(c-6),\n\n(586)\n\n(B8d)\n0(c~5),\n\n(B8e)\n\n0(c-4),\n\n(B8/)\n\nwhere 7^ is the Christoffel symbols in coordinates of the Galilean inertia! RF. One may make\nthem vanish by choosing quasi-Cartesian coordinates.\nB.6. Expansion for the Ricci Tensor\nBy making use of the expressions of eqs.(58), one may also find the relations for the expanded\ncomponents of the Ricci tensor Rmn(zp) in coordinates (zp) of an arbitrary RF. This tensor is\ndefined as follows:\n\nThen, in quasi-Cartesian coordinates of an arbitrary RF, one may obtain the expanded components of the Ricci tensor as follows:\n\n(B9a)\n\n130\n\n0(c-4).\n\n(59c)\n\nB.7. Expansion of an Arbitrary Energy-Momentum Tensor T^n.\nAt this point, the precise definition for the energy-momentum tensor of the matter distribution\nT^n is n\xc2\xb0t important. For future analysis, we will accept the most general assumptions concerning\nthis quantity. Namely, we will work with such energy-momentum tensors, T^n, the temporal, the\ntemporal-spatial, and the spatial components of which may be presented in terms of the order\nof magnitude as follows: T^n(y^) = (0(1), O(c~ l ), 0(cT 2 )).\nThe construction of the iterative scheme is required to perform the power expansion of the\nenergy-momentum tensor of matter Tmn as well. Suppose that Tmn may be expanded with\nrespect to the small parameter c"1 as follows:\nT00 = T<0>00 + T<2>00 + 0 (c-*) t\n\n_ r <l>0a + T<3>0a + O(c~5^\n\n(5106)\n\n^-6^\n\n(BlOc)\n\nThen, by taking into account expressions (Bl) and with the help of relations (510), we will\nget the inverse tensor Tmn as follows:\n^c-4),\n\n.\n\n(5110)\n\nTOQ = T^> + r0<3> + 0(cr5),\n\n(5116)\n\n+ T<*> + 0(c-6),\n\n(Bile)\n\nwhere\no-.<2> _ J\nT-.<2>00 , o ^<2> T-.<0>00\ni\n\n-\'oo\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nTa<2> =\n\n131\n\n+ ^ 9oo\n\nConcluding this part, we will present the expression for the right-hand side of the HilbertEinstein field equations, eqs.(4.1), which is given as follows:\n"->mn\n\n=\n\n-\'mn\n\n7^9\'mn \xe2\x80\xa2* \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nv"")\n\nBy substituting the expressions of eqs.(Bl)and(Bll) into definition (B12), we obtain the\nexpansions for the quantity Smn in the WFSMA:\nSoo =\n\nr<\xc2\xb0>00 +\n\n(r<2>\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 + 2 g$> r<\xc2\xb0>\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0 -\n\nTMA T<\n\nS0a = 7aA r<3>OA + 0(c-4),\n\n2\n\n>^) + G(c-4),\n\n(J513a)\n(B136)\n\nT<\xc2\xb0>00\n(B13c)\n\n132\n\nAppendix C: Transformation Laws of the Coordinate Base\nVectors.\nIn this appendix, we will present the transformation rules for the coordinate base vectors under\nthe general post-Newtonian coordinate transformations, which were discussed in Section 3.\n\nC.I. Direct Transformation of the Coordinate Base Vectors.\nAccording to the transformation rules of the solutions of the field equations hT^ and an arbitrary\nenergy- momentum tensor Tmn given by eqs.(3.1)-(3.4), in order to develop consistent perturbation theory for the N-body problem in the WFSMA, one needs to have the post-Newtonian\nexpansions for the following derivatives:\ndxk\ndy%\'\n\ndylB\ndx n >\n\ndykB\ndy%\'\n\nThese derivatives form the transformation matrix A* of the coordinate bases while the transition\nbetween the different coordinate systems is performed. Thus, for the transition from the barycentric RFo coordinate base e.m \xe2\x80\x94 d/dxn to the body-centric one e^ = d/dy\xe2\x84\xa2, the transformation\nmatrix is defined as usual: em = e\xc2\xa3dxP/dy\xe2\x84\xa2 = e^)fAm. Then, making use of the transformations\nof eqs.(3.5), it is easy to get\n\n(C16)\n\n7nt = 6"\nBy using expressions (Cl), one could obtain the determinant of this transformation matrix\nas follows:\n\nThe condition det | A^m(y^)l = 0 gives the boundary of validity of these transformations in their\napplication for constructing a proper RF.A.\n\nC.2. Transformation of the Background Metric\nRelations (Cl) are a useful tool for calculating the metric tensor 7$(y^) of the background\nspace-time in the non-inertial proper RP^ from the eqn.(3.4). The transformation rule for these\ncomponents is given by the usual expression:\nfc Q_J\n\n(C3)\n133\n\nThen, with the help of relations (Cl), the temporal-spatial components of the background metric\ncould be presented as\n\n0(c\'5).\n\n(C4)\n\nExpression (C4) contains the terms of two orders of magnitude: c~l and c~3. However, as we\ndiscussed in Appendix B, in the post-Newtonian approximation for any arbitrary RF, one expects\nthese components of the background metric tensor to be of the order goa(y^) ~ C*(c~3)- This\ngives the following condition for the function KA:\n\nThen, by formally integrating this last equation, we may find the following expression for the\nfunction KA:\n\nKA(y% y"A] = PA(y\xc2\xb0A) - VA^ \xe2\x80\xa2 y\\ + O(c-^y\xc2\xb0A.\n\n(C5b)\n\nThe result (C5) considerably simplifies the calculation of the transformation rules between the\ndifferent RFs. Thus, taking into account relation (C3), one may obtain the following expression\nfor the tensor\n\n(C6a)\n\n(C66)\nA\nV Aoa V Ao0 +\n\n(C6c)\n\n134\n\nRelations (C6) are the KLQ parametrization of the metric 7^n, which forms the background\nRiemann-flat space-time in the proper RF,4:\n-Rfc/mn(7s1) = 0.\n\nThe functions KA, LA, and Q\xc2\xb0^ will be chosen in order to separate the forces of inertia from the\ngravitational forces that are measured by the observer in this RF.\nRelations (C5) are a useful tool for simplifying the result (C2) as well. Thus, for the determinant of the transformation matrix, we will get following expression:\n\nC.3. Inverse Transformation of the Coordinate Base Vectors.\nUsing the transformation rule for the base vectors, e?A = d/dy^, of the proper RF^ to those\nof the inertia! barycentric RFo, ep = d/dx?, given by expressions (3.18), one easily obtains the\ninverse transformation matrix A^5fl(xp) = dy^/dx\xe2\x84\xa2 for this transition as well:\n\n(C8a)\n\n(C8b)\n\n(C8c)\n\n(C8d)\n\n135\n\nwhere we have partially taken the result of (C56) into account in a form of the relation\n\xc2\xb0A,ft) + 0(c-3) = -^0(x\xc2\xb0) + O(c^).\n\nC.4. Mutual Transformation Between the Two Quasi-Inertial RFs.\nThe expressions for the transformation of the base vectors between two quasi-inertial RFs\nand (e1^) may be obtained from relations (3.19).

From these expressions, (C9), one may obtain the determinant of the transformation matrix ^BAm(yA) for the\ntransformations between two different proper RFs as follows:\n\n(CIO)\nThe condition det \\^ B A m (y A )\\ = 0 gives the boundary of validity of these transformations.\n\n136\n\nAppendix D: Transformations of Some Physical Quantities\nand Solutions.\nIn this appendix, we will present the transformation laws for the gauge conditions, the components of the Ricci tensor, and the components of an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor of\nmatter of the matter distribution Tmn for the unperturbed solutions of the field equations hmn\nand for the interaction term h^, eqs.(3.1)-(3.4), under the general coordinate transformations\ndiscussed in Section 3 of this report.\nD.I. Transformation of the Gauge Conditions.\nWith the help of eqs.(Fl) and the expansion of the metric tensor gmn given by eqs.(\xc2\xa37), we may\nobtain the relations for the gauge conditions expanded in a power series of the small parameter\n\n(i). In Cartesian coordinates of the inertial RFo, the background space-time may be taken in\na simple form of the Minkowski metric: 7^n = (1, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x941, \xe2\x80\x94!)\xe2\x80\xa2 Then the power expansion\nof the gauge condition of eqs.(jB7) may be presented for n = 0 as follows:\ncp) = O(c~5),\n\n(Dla)\n\nand for n = a as follows:\n\n:p) = O(c~4}.\n\n(Dlb)\n\n(ii). In an analogous manner, one may obtain the expressions for the gauge conditions in coordinates (y^) of the proper RF^ of body (A). For n = 0,\n\nand for n = a,\n\nD.2. Transformation of the Ricci Tensor\nWith the help of the expansion for the components of the Ricci tensor, eqs^BQ), one may obtain\nthis tensor in coordinates of the different RFs.\n\n137\n\n(i). Thus, by making use of the relations for the covariant de Donder gauge conditions in\ncoordinates (xp) of inertial RFo, eqs.(Dl), one may present the components for the Ricci\ntensor in the following form:\n\n0(c-5),\n\n-\n\n(D3b)\n(mc]\n\n(ii). From relations (D2) and with the help of the expressions for the Ricci tensor given by\neqs.(.B9), one may get this tensor in coordinates (y^) of the proper RF^ as well:\n\nD.3. Transformation Law for an Arbitrary Energy-Momentum Tensor Tmn.\nIn this subsection, we will present the power expansion for the components of 5mn = T mn \xe2\x80\x94\\g mn T\ndefined by equation (\xc2\xa312).\n138\n\n(i). By assuming that each body (B) in the system may be described by the reduced energymomentum tensor S^n, one may easily obtain the total energy- momentum tensor Smn for\nthe entire system. Thus, in the coordinates of the inertia! RFo, this tensor may be presented\nas follows:\n\nThen, with this relation above and from eqs.(.B10)-(.Bll), (-B13), and (C6) for the coordinate transformations to the barycentric inertial RFo, we will obtain the following result:\n\n- [2-- 0 K B (x\xc2\xb0,x\xc2\xbb - yBo(z\xc2\xb0))\n\n(ii). One may obtain the relation for the energy-momentum tensor of the entire system in the\ncoordinates of the proper RF^ as follows:\n01 fc\n\n9ufc dvlr, cB/0,9\n?3/B \xc2\xb0ya D\n\n\xc2\xb0 \'\n\nThen, making use of the formula above and from eqs.(510)-(Bll) and (B13), the expression for the quantity Smn in coordinates (j/^) of the proper RF^, with the help of eqs.(C7),\nmay be presented as follows:\n\n+2\n\n139\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nD.4.

Transformation for the Energy-Momentum Tensor of a Perfect Fluid.\nLet us define the model of matter distribution of a body (B) in its proper RFs by the tensor\ndensity Tg"1 given by\n\n141\n\nwhere all the quantities entering the formula above are calculated in the coordinates (y^) of the\nnon-inertial proper RF^g. Then, one may obtain the following post-Newtonian expansion of the\ntensor Tg1" in coordinates (y^) of the proper\n= PBO [l - \xc2\xabX + n + 2( \xc2\xa3 UC -\n\n= PB0va l - \xc2\xabX +n + 2 ^ ^ - -\n\n-\n\n*o\n\n+\n\n+ <?(c-4) ,\n\n(Dllb)\n\nThen, by using these relations, one may easily obtain the expressions for the right-hand side\nof the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational field equations in the form of the quantity 5mn, defined by\neqs.(4.1), (513), and (D5)-(L>6).\n(i). From eqs.(\xc2\xa3>5) and with the help of the expressions of eqs.(Z)lO), we obtain components\nof the quantity Smn in coordinates (xp) of the barycentric inertial RFo as follows:\n\n- 2 ^ UB> - 2tv(zPK(:cp) +\np\nB\'\n\n+ O(c~4} ,\n\n^(x\xc2\xb0, x" - j\xc2\xa30(x\xc2\xb0)) [ V \xc2\xa3 (x p ) + O(C-3)] ,\n\n(D12a)\n(D126)\n\nB\n\n(\xc2\xa3>12c)\nB"\nwhere the total mass density of the system is denoted as\n\n(ii). In an analogous manner, but with the help of the expressions of eqs.(\xc2\xa3>6), we may get the\nrelations for tensor Smn in the coordinates (y^) of the proper\n\nM<0\n\n+\n\n+ 0(c~4)] ,\n\n(D13a)\n\nB\n\nB\n\nIt should be noted that the functional dependence of the densities in expressions (D12)-(\xc2\xa3)13)\nreflects the positions of all the bodies with respect to different RFs in the sense of Dirac\'s delta\nfunction.\n142\n\nAppendix E: Transformations of the Gravitational Potentials.\nTo establish the transformation properties of the unperturbed solutions for n^n (given in Appendix A) for transitions from coordinates (y^) of the proper RF^ to those of the barycentric\nRFo (and backwards), one should take into account that these solutions contain the integrals\nover the three-dimensional volumes of the bodies. For this reason, we should first derive the\ntransformation laws for generalized gravitational potentials. The powerful technique for obtaining these rules was elaborated for some special cases of transformations earlier by Chandrasekhar\n& Contopulos (1967) (see also Brumberg & Kopejkin, 1988a; Will, 1993). It was noted that the\ntransformation of the integrands should include the point transformation combined with the Lie\ntransfer from one hypersurface to another. This transfer should be produced along the integral\ncurves of the vector field of the body matter\'s four- velocity. The most sophisticated transformation at the post-Newtonian level is required for the Newtonian potential UB \xe2\x80\xa2 We will extend this\ntechnique to the general case of the coordinate transformations, which was discussed in Section\n3 and in Appendix C.\nFor the transformation from the proper RF.4 to the barycentric one, RFo> with the help of\nexpressions (3.18), one may establish the relationship between the observer\'s spatial coordinates\nand those of the integrating point as follows:\n(XP _\nv -\n\n(Ela)\nBy using the same procedure as above, from eqs.(3.19)-(3.20) we may obtain the expression for\nthe observer\'s spatial coordinates and those of the integrating point while the transformation\nbetween two proper RFs (corresponding to the bodies (A) and (B)) is being performed:\n\n1\n\n\'\n\n1+\n\n, y\'A])\n\nFor the transformation of the integrand, we should take into account the property of the\ninvariant elementary volume (Kopejkin, 1988; Will, 1993):\nV),\n\n(E2)\n\nwhere \\/\xe2\x80\x94g is the determinant of the metric tensor and u\xc2\xb0 is the temporal component of the\ninvariant four-velocity.\n143\n\nProm expressions (B2) and the components of the metric tensor of the order ~ c\ndifferent RFs (given by (4.8) and (4.11)), we will get\n\n2\n\nin the\n\n(\xc2\xa33a)\n\n= I+2\nand\n/\n\n-9(ypA) =\n\nThe components of the invariant four-velocity are denned as follows:\n\xc2\xab V)\n\n= v k (zP) [9oo(zp} + 290e(z?)vf(z*>) + gve(z*>)v* (z*>)vv (z*>}\\ ~^\'\\\n\n(\xc2\xa374)\n\nwhere v k (z p ) = dz^/dz0 = (1,25).

Thus, for\ns = 1 and s = 2, this formula is trivial. For s = 3 and s = 4 from the right-hand side of equation\n(G2), one may check that these relations hold as well.\nIndeed, by straightforward calculation, we have the following result for 5 = 3:\n(G"i _ &"iXa"2 - b"2)(a"3 -b" 3 )- a"1 (a"2 -a"2 (a"3 - 6"3 ) (a"1 - 6"1 ) - a*3 (a"1 - 6"1 ) (a"2 -&"*)+\n+aI/1a"2(a"3 - &"3) + a1/2aI/3(aI/1 - &"1) + a1* a"1 (a1* = a"1 a"2 a"3 - fc"1\nAnd for s = 4,\n\n-(a"1 - d^Xa*2 -fc^X^3-fc^Xa"4- &"4) + a"1 (a"8 - 6I/2)(a1/3\n+a\'/2(a\'/3 -fc^Xa"4- 6I/4)(a1/1 - 6l/2)(al/3 - t1\'3) - a1\'1 a"2 (a"3 - 6I/3)(al/4 - 6"4) - a"1 a*3 (a*2 - 6I/2)(oI/4 - b1\'4)* - 6"3) - aI/2aI/3(a1/1 -fe^)^174- 6"4) - o^a"4^"1 - ^^(a1\'3 - &"3)- V2} + a"1 a"2 a*3 (a"4 - &"\xc2\xab) + aI/2al/3a1/4(aI/1 -ft1\'1)+ a^a"4a^ (a"2 -\n\n152\n\nThen by induction, one may extrapolate the validity of expression (G2) for any s > 4.\nMaking use of the relation (G2), we will simplify the form of some expressions for the metric\ntensor in the proper RF>i and the interaction term in the coordinates (xp) of the barycentric\ninertial RFo.

This suggests that one may extend the1\ngeneralized Fermi conditions in the local region of body (A) (or at the immediate vicinity of its\nworld-line 7.4, given by relations (5.2)), as follows:\n,\n\n(Gl2a)\n\nwhere superscript ext denotes the external sources of gravity. Relations (G12) summarize our\nexpectations based on the Equivalence Principle about the local gravitational environment of the\nself- gravitating and arbitrarily shaped extended bodies.\n\n156\n\nAppendix H: Some Important Identities.\nIn this appendix, we will present some identities necessary to reduce the expressions in Section 6.\nWe will use the definition for the total mass density of the system p in the coordinates (y^) as\ngiven by (6.4); for the total Newtonian potential U as given by (6.17); and for the total vector\npotential of the system V as given by expression (6.20). Then, one may obtain the required\nidentities simply by using the eq.m.
