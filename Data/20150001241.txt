Abell7\nNASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX 77058, USA\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently studying an\noption for the Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM) that would capture a multi-ton\nboulder (typically 2-4 meters in size) from the surface of a large (~100+ meter) Near-Earth\nAsteroid (NEA) and return it to cislunar space for subsequent human and robotic\nexploration. This alternative mission approach, designated the Robotic Boulder Capture\nOption (Option B), has been investigated to determine the mission feasibility and identify\npotential differences from the initial ARRM concept of capturing an entire small NEA (4-10\nmeters in size), which has been designated the Small Asteroid Capture Option (Option A).\nCompared to the initial ARRM concept, Option B allows for centimeter-level\ncharacterization over an entire large NEA, the certainty of target NEA composition type, the\nability to select the boulder that is captured, numerous opportunities for mission\nenhancements to support science objectives, additional experience operating at a low-gravity\nplanetary body including extended surface contact, and the ability to demonstrate future\nplanetary defense strategies on a hazardous-size NEA. Option B can leverage precursor\nmissions and existing Agency capabilities to help ensure mission success by targeting wellcharacterized asteroids and can accommodate uncertain programmatic schedules by\ntailoring the return mass.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA\n\nkey component of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA\xe2\x80\x99s) Asteroid Initiative is the\nAsteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM). Following the 2011 Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS)\nfeasibility study1, NASA initiated a feasibility study of a mission to capture an entire small (approximately 4-10\nmeters in size) Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) and redirect it to cislunar space where astronauts will explore it and\nreturn samples from it. The ARRM leverages a high specific impulse (Isp=2,000-3,000 s), high-power (40-50 kW)\nSolar Electric Propulsion (SEP) system in development by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Technology Mission Directorate\n(STMD).2 An alternative ARRM option also being studied by NASA would capture a multi-ton boulder (typically 24 meters in size) from the surface of a larger (~100+ meter) NEA and return it to cislunar space for subsequent\nhuman and robotic exploration.3 Additionally, one or more planetary defense (PD) demonstrations would be\nperformed while at the NEA. This mission approach, which is depicted in Fig. 1, has been designated the Robotic\nBoulder Capture Option (Option B) and a preliminary assessment has be performed to determine the mission\n1\n\nSenior Space Systems Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch, E402/Mail Stop 462, Senior Member AIAA.\nAerospace Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch (E402), Mail Stop 462, Senior Member AIAA.\n3\nSenior Mechanical Engineer, Mechanical Systems Branch (D202), Mail Stop 432.\n4\nAerospace Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch (E402), Mail Stop 462, Senior Member AIAA.\n5\nAerospace Engineer, Space Mission Analysis Branch (E402), Mail Stop 462, Member AIAA.\n6\nProject System Engineer, Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office (5990), Mail Stop 408, Senior Member AIAA.\n7\nLead Scientist for Planetary Small Bodies, Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate (KR111),\nMail Stop KR.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n2\n\nFigure 1: ARRM Robotic Boulder Capture Option (Option B)\n(Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\nfeasibility and identify potential differences from the initial ARRM concept, which has been designated the Small\nAsteroid Capture Option (Option A). This mission approach provides NASA the option to trade potential return\nmass for centimeter-level characterization over an entire large NEA, the ability to select the NEA\xe2\x80\x99s composition\ntype (i.e., a water/volatile-rich carbonaceous target), the ability to select a well-characterized, science community\nselected sample with geological context, additional experience operating at a low-gravity planetary body including\nextended surface contact critical to future human and robotic missions, and the ability to demonstrate future\ndeflection strategies on a NEA of a relevant size which will inform strategies to defend our home planet.\nThe ARRM, with a planned launch date in 2019, is one of three components of the Asteroid Redirect Mission\n(ARM). The second component is the Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) in which astronauts aboard\nNASA's Orion spacecraft launched on the Space Launch System (SLS) will rendezvous with the returned asteroid or\nboulder in a Lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit (LDRO), conduct spacewalks to collect samples, and return the samples\nto the Earth for analysis. The ARCM is planned for the mid 2020\xe2\x80\x99s. The third ARM component, which is currently\nbeing conducted, is an observation campaign to identify and characterize candidate NEAs using ground-based\nfacilities including optical telescopes, radar facilities, and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), and spacebased assets, such as NASA's Spitzer Infrared Space Telescope and Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (NEOWISE) Space Telescope. The same assets are being used to help catalog the general population of\nNEAs and identify those that are a threat to impact the Earth.\nThe capabilities, systems, and operational experience developed and implemented by the ARRM, ARCM, and\nsubsequent missions to the returned asteroidal material will advance NASA's goal of sending humans beyond lowEarth orbit (LEO) and on the path to future missions to Mars. The extensibility of these missions is discussed in\nfurther detail in Section X.\n\nII. Stakeholder Benefits\nThe ARRM Option B approach addresses the needs of a broad set of stakeholders, including human exploration,\nplanetary defense, science, and commercial and international partnerships. Additionally, the mission approach\nleverages precursor missions and existing Agency capabilities to enable mission success. This mission option\nsupports future human exploration by addressing multiple Mars-forward technology and operations gaps including\noperations around and on the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos. The approach also provides a well-characterized,\naccessible, multi-ton boulder for astronauts to explore and return samples from, while also being robust to\nprogrammatic uncertainties.\nIn addition to providing a near-term destination for crews to explore, Option B advances various aspects of\nrobotic systems and autonomous operations critical to human exploration and robotic missions. The SEP system,\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwhich is used by both options, will enable a wide range of human missions in cislunar space, to NEAs, and to the\nMars system, as well as robotic exploration of the solar system. The ARRM systems, subsystems, and technologies\ncan be evolved to facilitate more demanding missions through both modularity and scalability.\nIn the area of planetary defense, Option B permits the demonstration of one or more orbital deflection techniques\non a relevant, hazardous-size NEA. Although Option A permits the demonstration of deflection techniques on a very\nsmall NEA that can be verified more rapidly, these small NEAs are not a significant threat to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants\nas atmospheric entry will typically completely ablate NEA\xe2\x80\x99s less than 10 meters. Additionally, Option B provides\nthe opportunity to test a kinetic impact technique, utilizing the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) as an observer\nspacecraft, and provides extended surface interaction with a hazardous-size NEA, both of which are likely critical to\nfuture efforts to deflect or disrupt an Earth-impacting asteroid or comet.\nScience community interest is focused on primitive, water/volatile-rich carbonaceous targets that could provide\nvaluable information on the formation of our solar system and the origins of life on Earth. Option B allows the\nreturn of a well-characterized, science community selected sample with geological context from a NEA of a known\ncompositional type (i.e., a large carbonaceous boulder and one or more parent body surface samples). The mission\noption also provides numerous opportunities for mission enhancements to support science objectives, including:\nrobotic arm sample collection (e.g., drilling, coring, surface sample collection, and caching); the ability to host and\ndeploy free-flyers or surface rovers/hoppers; and additional scientific instrumentation for in-situ or remote\nobservation of a large NEA. Additionally, the advanced SEP technologies, instrumentation, and low-gravity body\nautonomous operations will help enable more capable future robotic missions.\nThe mission option offers important benefits to commercial and international partners, by providing critical\noperational experience interacting with a large, low-gravity body and collecting multiple tons of asteroidal material,\naccess to a large surface area of potentially volatile/water-rich carbonaceous material, and the opportunity for hosted\npayloads including In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) experiments and demonstrations. The return of many tons of\ncarbonaceous material to cislunar space would significantly accelerate the efforts of the fledgling asteroid mining\nindustry, which in turn will aid humanity\xe2\x80\x99s expansion into the solar system by tapping the vast resources available\nfrom asteroids.\n\nIII. Flight System Overview\nThe ARRM Option B flight system shares many similarities with the initial ARRM approach of returning an\nentire small NEA. Only minimal modifications are required for Mission Module and SEP Module on the Asteroid\nRedirect Vehicle (ARV), and the required sensor suite is also very similar. Conversely, the capture system and the\nproximity operations are significantly different. Due to the coherent nature of the boulder that will be collected,\nencapsulation of the asteroidal material is not required and several autonomous manipulator-based capture system\noptions have been investigated. The lack of encapsulation also facilitates exploration and sample collection after the\nboulder is returned to the Earth-Moon system. The current capture system design has focused on accommodating a\nfree-standing boulder that is one to four meters in size (up to a mass of ~70 t), but the design can be scaled to\naccommodate up to at least 10 meter boulders. This allows the capture system to be tailored to handle the maximum\nmass returnable from the selected asteroid. Currently, there are no target NEAs that provide the higher mass-return\nopportunities needed for these larger sizes in the timeframe being considered for the ARRM.\nThe Option B ARV is designed in a modular fashion to both enable reduction in the schedule required for\nintegration and test (see Section IX) and to allow for module design re-use in the future. The spacecraft flight system\nconsists of the following three modules: 1.) SEP Module; 2.) Mission Module; and 3.) Capture Module. Some of the\nOption B module characteristics and how they differ from Option A are identified in Fig. 2. Depicted is a capture\nsystem option that utilizes a space frame structure for both the capture and contact arms. Section VI provides details\non additional Capture Module options investigated.\nThe ARRM Option B approach utilizes the same SEP Module concept that as Option A. The SEP Module\nincludes a pair of solar arrays that generate 51 kWe at beginning of life at 1 AU. Two possible solar array\nconfigurations are shown in Fig. 3. The upper configuration is the Roll-Out Solar Array (ROSA) being developed by\nDeployable Space Systems (DSS). Each wing is approximately 4.5 meters wide and 14 meters long. The lower\nconfiguration is ATK\xe2\x80\x99s MegaFlex solar array and consists of two circular arrays that are each approximately 9.6 m\n(32 ft) in diameter. The SEP Module Electric Propulsion System (EPS) is designed for 40 kWe input power that uses\na 300 V Power Processing Unit (PPU) architecture and 4 or 6 magnetically shielded hall thrusters that operate with\nan Isp between 1,800 and 3,000 s and are 50-55% efficient depending on input power. Body-mounted, louvered heat\npipe radiators provide thermal control. The SEP Module also includes the xenon feed system for each thruster and\n12 xenon tanks capable of holding a total of 11.1 t of xenon (including 11% margin). The SEP Module also includes\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nCapture\nModule\n(New)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Avionics and sensors required for terrain relative\nclosed-loop navigation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vision processing, data compression and storage\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Capture system (capture and contact arms) and\ncontrol \xe2\x80\x93 Removal of inflatable capture bag\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simple interface with Capture Module\n\nMission\nModule\n(Modified)\n\nSEP Module\n(\n(Unmodified)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Removal of winch actuators\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Removal of sensors\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Removal of proximity and capture control\nrequirement\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Possible change in RCS thruster size and location\nto accommodate larger boulders\n\nFigure 2.

Possible ARV Solar Array Configurations (Image Credit: NASA/JPL).\na Reaction Control System (RCS) with a 400 kg mono-propellant tank and 4 thruster pods which are currently preintegrated. For very large boulders (greater than ~70 t) larger RCS thrusters may be required to facilitate ascent from\nthe surface of the selected NEA. At the aft end of the SEP Module is docking interface that allows the Orion MultiPurpose Crew Vehicle to attach to the ARV during the ARCM.\nThe SEP Module is controlled by the Mission Module, which provides the main command and data handling\ncapability for the overall vehicle. The Mission Module is responsible for ground communications and ranging, and\ncontrol of the vehicle actuators (SEP and chemical thrusters in the SEP Module and momentum wheels in the\nMission Module). During the asteroid proximity operations phase, the Mission Module receives onboard navigation\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ninformation from the Capture Module, executing an autonomous sequence to descend to the surface, collect the\nboulder, and return to a safe trajectory. To support the crewed phase, the Mission Module hosts a tool stowage box\nand provides crew translation aids between the Orion spacecraft and Capture Module. Together, the SEP Module\nand Mission Module form a functional spacecraft bus that can be utilized for a variety of future missions.\nThe Capture Module provides all functions necessary to perform the onboard asteroid-relative and boulderrelative navigation, asteroid surface interaction, boulder capture, boulder restraint during the ascent and return flight.\nIt also provides enhanced hardware to support crew extra-vehicular activity (EVA), including robotic preparation of\nthe work site prior to crew arrival and between EVAs, and potentially robotic caching of boulder surface and subsurface samples for crew evaluation, collection, and return to Earth. Additional details on the Capture Module are\nprovided in Section VI.\n\nIV. Target Selection and Mission Design\nCharacterization of a candidate NEA is a critical aspect of the asteroid being selected as the target for the\nARRM. High-quality remote characterization utilizing ground-based and space-based assets can be extremely\nbeneficial, allowing Option B targets to be selected based on sufficient knowledge about the NEA (size, spin state,\ncomposition type, presence of boulders, etc.). However, remote characterization has limitations and in-situ\nreconnaissance from a precursor mission can provide the detailed information that can help ensure mission success.\nOf the four asteroids larger than 100 m that have been or may be visited by robotic spacecraft, three could be\npotential targets for the ARRM mission.\nWhile numerous Near-Earth Asteroids larger than 100 m have been discovered and remotely characterized, only\nItokawa (visited by the Japanese Hayabusa spacecraft in 2005) and Eros (visited by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Near Earth Asteroid\nRendezvous (NEAR)-Shoemaker spacecraft in 2000-2001) are currently well-characterized. Itokawa, which is a\nstony (S-type) NEA, provides an attractive destination for Option B by providing hundreds of candidate boulders of\nvarious dimensions (see Section V). Itokawa\xe2\x80\x99s orbit and the desire to return the boulder to cislunar space by 2025\nlimit the return mass to approximately 5 metric tons. Extending the return date by as little as one year can increase\nthe return mass by a factor of approximately four. Eros is not a viable candidate due to the lack of opportunities to\nreturn mass in the timeframe being considered for the ARRM.\nBased on Hayabusa\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Itokawa, it has been utilized to develop a detailed mission design to\nassess options and risks associated with proximity operations and to understand spacecraft design requirements.\nHowever, it is not the only candidate NEA for Option B with the possibility of extensive precursor reconnaissance.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx)\nspacecraft will visit Bennu in 2018 and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (JAXA\xe2\x80\x99s) Hayabusa 2 spacecraft\nwill rendezvous with 1999 JU3 in 2018. Both will provide detailed characterization of their physical properties. One\nadditional candidate, 2008 EV5, has been highly characterized by ground-based radar (signal-to-noise ratio > 5000)\nand in the infrared wavelengths with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft. Based on groundbased reconnaissance, all three of these NEAs are carbonaceous chondrite targets (C-types) and are believed to be\nwater/volatile-rich and may contain significant amounts of organic materials.\nIn addition to these four potential Option B targets, there exists the possibility that additional NEAs could be\nidentified and sufficiently characterized using radar observations prior to mission launch. A scan using a ranking\nparameter and a thrust-limited, multi-revolution Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s solver identified numerous asteroids with ballistic\ntrajectories with a low velocity change (\xe2\x88\x86V) needed for significant mass return. Both the Mission Analysis LowThrust Optimization (MALTO) tool and the Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG) software tool were\nused to perform global searches for low-thrust, gravity-assist trajectories to potential targets.4 Trajectories to over 60\nOption B target NEAs with upcoming radar observations were found, but opportunities for observations with high\nsignal-to-noise ratios are limited. The existence of a well-characterized target (Itokawa), three high-value\ncarbonaceous chondrite targets (two with planned precursor missions), and the possibility of additional targets being\nidentified and remotely characterized provides a robust set of target NEAs for Option B.\nThe ARRM trajectory design is complex for a variety of reasons and an overview of the Option B mission design\nand comparison with Option A is provided in Fig. 4. While the ARV\xe2\x80\x99s SEP system offers the propellant efficiency\nrequired to return a massive asteroid boulder to an orbit in cislunar space, it is only capable of relatively low-thrust\n(< 2 N). Thus, long periods of thrust are required to achieve the necessary \xe2\x88\x86V for a mission, and low-thrust\ntrajectory optimization is necessary to identify feasible trajectories composed of long-thrust arcs. Additionally, for\nany candidate NEA the return mass is subject to the interdependence between mission duration, launch date, launch\nvehicle capacity, and spacecraft performance. The return mass is maximized in the interplanetary trajectory and used\nto inform proximity operations analysts regarding the largest boulder mass that can be captured and redirected. The\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nprogrammatic desire to return the ARV to the Earth-Moon system for crew availability by the end of 2024 places a\nstrict upper bound on the mission time of flight and eliminates trajectory options that might allow for more optimal\nphasing with a later return date, which would allow a higher return mass. In addition, extended ARV operations at\nthe NEA (e.g., one year or more) for characterization and planetary defense operations decreases trajectory options\ndue to the reduced time available to thrust. Later return dates, later launch dates, and reduction in stay time have also\nbeen assessed to illustrate the effect of programmatic decisions and uncertainties on the maximum boulder return\nmass.\nDesign space complexity is increased by the possible inclusion of a planetary gravity assist to reduce \xe2\x88\x86V\nrequirements. NEA boulder retrieval missions can benefit from energy- and plane-altering flybys of Earth, Mars, or\nVenus, warranting a thorough search for gravity assists on both the outbound and inbound legs. This design space\ngrows significantly when considering target asteroids in addition to those that have had or will have precursors\nbefore launch.\nFor ARRM Option B missions launched on a Falcon Heavy or Delta IV Heavy, a pair of lunar gravity assists\nincreases the departure characteristic energy (C3) from -2 km2/s2 to 2 km2/s2.5,6 Interplanetary trajectory modeling\nwas simplified by assuming a maximum Earth departure mass based on the launch vehicle capability to a C3 of -2\nkm2/s2 and an upper bound on the departure C3 of 2 km2/s2 with a declination between +/- 30 degrees. For the\nFalcon Heavy, the maximum spacecraft mass was approximately 13.2 t. These values include mass decrements for\nthe propellant assumed to be necessary for any maneuvers to compensate for launch vehicle insertion errors and\nperform phasing before lunar flybys. The ARV dry mass plus the reaction control system (RCS) propellant limits the\navailable xenon for low-thrust propulsion. The ARV dry mass plus RCS propellant was 5.2 t for the 2,000 s Isp EPS\nconfiguration and 5.0 t for the 3,000 s Isp EPS configuration.\nOnce at the NEA, the ARV will conduct proximity operations to characterize the asteroid, collect the boulder,\nand conduct planetary defense demonstration(s). The time required for characterization is dependent on whether a\nprecursor mission has already been conducted, with less time required for a previously characterized asteroid such as\nItokawa. The time allocation for boulder collection includes a budget for five collection attempts at up to three\ndifferent locations on the NEA. Time is also budgeted for PD demonstration operations and measuring the change in\nthe NEA\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. Specifically, a gravity tractor demonstration using the captured boulder to augment the mass of the\nARV has been assumed as the primary PD demonstration (see Sections VII and VIII). This planetary defense\ndemonstration is dependent on the mass of the NEA, the mass of the collected boulder, and the ARV thrust\n\nFigure 4: Option B Mission Design Overview and Comparison with Option A.\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ncapability. It needs to be conducted long enough to perturb the orbital state of the NEA outside of the navigation\nuncertainty bounds of the nominal, unaltered orbit, along with enough elapsed time for the perturbation to reach a\nmeasurable level and for the Earth-ARV orbital geometry to permit this measurement. For Itokawa, the minimum\nstay time at the asteroid was determined to be 400 days for a conservative design. This stay time is also used as an\nestimate for the other asteroids examined with the understanding that the stay time would change after a detailed\nproximity operations design for each particular target NEA is performed. Additionally, a reduced stay time of 120\ndays was also examined as the likely lower limit for boulder collection and a shortened planetary defense\ndemonstration.\nTrajectories were generated for Itokawa, Bennu, 1999 JU 3, and 2008 EV5 for Delta IV Heavy, Falcon Heavy,\nand SLS launch vehicles. The maximum boulder return masses in metric tons for three different Earth system\ndeparture periods (2019, 2020, and 2021) and six different Earth system arrival periods (2024-2029) with a Falcon\nHeavy launch are shown in Table 1. The one year launch periods are defined assuming a launch window that opens\nno earlier than June 1st, resulting in the ARV leaving the Earth-Moon no earlier than September 23rd when utilizing\nlunar gravity assist. The arrival period in the table is defined as one year starting on January 1st of the listed year.\nThe highest return mass identified is reported in Table 1, where both 2,000 s and 3,000 s Isp electric propulsion\nsystems were investigated in conjunction with both direct and gravity assist options.\nTable 1. Maximum Boulder Return Mass (metric tons) for\nCandidate NEAs with a Falcon Heavy Launch Vehicle.\n\nAn Earth Gravity Assist (EGA) on the return leg frequently increased the maximum return mass for missions\nwith total duration greater than 5 years. EGAs are especially beneficial for asteroids with relatively high\ninclinations, where the Earth flyby can effectively enable a propellant-free plane change. In the case of 2008 EV5,\nwith an inclination of 7.4 degrees from the ecliptic, an EGA improved the maximum boulder return mass by 80% for\nthe dates shown. Fig. 5 shows the boulder mass and size for a June 2019 launch and crew availability in cislunar\nspace between February-May of 2025 for the three launch vehicles and four candidate asteroids assessed. The size\n\nFigure 5. Comparison of Boulder Size and Mass Return for Candidate Launch Vehicles and NEAs.\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nof boulder is significantly larger for the three carbonaceous targets due to both the higher return mass and the lower\ndensity assumed for these targets (1.62 g/cm3 vs. 3.22 g/cm3). An example of the interplanetary trajectory for a\nBennu boulder return mission launching in 2019 and returning to the Earth-Moon system in 2024 is plotted in Fig. 6.\nThis trajectory assumes a 120 day stay time, the use of the SLS and an ARV utilizing an EPS with an I sp of 2,000 s.\nThe red lines represent the three-dimensional EPS thrust direction at different point in the trajectory represented in a\ntwo-dimensional plot.\n\nBennu\nArrive Earth\n1/19/2024\n\nArrive Bennu\n4/23/2021\nSun\nEarth\nOrbit\n\nBennu\n\nSun\n\nDepart Bennu\n8/21/2021\n\nDepart Earth\n9/23/2019\n\nEarth\nOrbit\n\nOutbound\n\nInbound\n\nFigure 6.

NEA and Boulder Characteristics\nNEAs are generated through various dynamical and collisional interactions within the asteroid main belt, and\nrange from objects as small as a few meters to several tens of kilometers in diameter. The NEA population of objects\nhas a wide range of physical properties and characteristics as understood from the information obtained from the\nanalysis of meteorites, ground- and space-based observations of small bodies, and robotic spacecraft missions. Many\ndifferent types of compositions are thought to exist among the NEA population, and it is estimated that there may be\nin excess of at least 100 different parent bodies from which these objects originated.7 In addition to the\ncompositional variety, NEAs also appear to have a wide range of shapes, internal structures, and configurations. 8\nThese objects can be intact polygonal monoliths, heavily-fractured but coherent prolate bodies, or highly porous\nrubble piles. Some of these objects even form as binary or ternary systems. NEAs also have a wide range of possible\nspin rates and states. The NEA targets identified for Option B possess rotational periods of approximately 4-12\nhours, compared to possible rotational periods as short as two minutes assumed for small NEAs targeted by Option\nA.\nThe best observations of NEAs and their physical properties have been made by robotic spacecraft flyby or\nrendezvous missions (e.g., NASA\xe2\x80\x99s NEAR-Shoemaker, Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Hayabusa, and China\xe2\x80\x99s Chang\xe2\x80\x99e 2). These missions\nhave allowed a much better understanding of the surfaces and internal characteristics of NEAs. One of the most\nsuccessful NEA missions to date has been the Hayabusa mission to Itokawa. Hayabusa determined that Itokawa has\na porosity of ~40% and is a rubble-pile asteroid.9 Images from the Hayabusa mission, as shown in Fig. 7, indicate\nthat ~20% of the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is smooth terrain. These terrains are wide, flat areas with relatively few hazards,\nbut contain many boulders. One of the largest areas is the Muses Sea region, which is approximately 60 m across\n(smooth region visible in the lower image of Fig. 7). These areas are dominated by pebble size particles and stereo\nanalysis suggests that some boulders in these regions are not embedded. 10 Boulder counts from the Hayabusa images\nhave identified thousands of boulders on Itokawa's surface as shown in Fig. 8, which plots the observed number (N)\nof boulders (also referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cblocks\xe2\x80\x9d) per square kilometer greater than a particular diameter (D) for the lowlands\nand highlands, along with the global distribution of boulders greater than six meters.11 The total surface of Itokawa\nis approximately 0.4 km2, so Itokawa possesses hundreds of candidate boulders, many of which are located in very\naccessible regions. The presence of boulders on the surface of NEAs and the mechanism by which they are produced\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nis thought to be relatively common based on the data from the Hayabusa mission, remote sensing observations, and\ndynamical modelling. To date, boulders have been seen on every NEA visited by spacecraft.\nRecent radar observations of Bennu suggest the presence of boulders on its surface which will be confirmed by\nOSRIS-REx well before the launch of the ARRM.12 No radar observations have yet been made of 1999 JU3, but\nHayabusa 2 will be able to observe and characterize any boulders on its surface, also before launch of the ARRM.\n2008 EV5 was considered as the prime target of the European Space Agency\xe2\x80\x99s (ESA\xe2\x80\x99s) Marco Polo-R sample return\nmission and has been well-characterized via ground-based assets. The planetary radar observations of this target\nsuggest that it also has numerous boulders on its surface, which would make it attractive target for Option B.13 The\nmanner in which these boulders are generated and their evolutionary history implies that they are relatively coherent\nobjects. The composition of the NEA also plays a factor into the inherent strength of the boulders on its surface.\nItokawa has been determined to have an LL ordinary chondrite composition (LL stands for Low iron and Low\nmetal) based on samples returned to Earth in 2010 via the Hayabusa mission. 14 Such objects have compressive\nstrengths on the order of a few tens to hundreds of megapascals (MPa). Other NEAs under consideration as potential\ntargets likely have compositions with lower strength, but even carbonaceous chondrite targets have compressive\nstrengths from 0.3 to 50 MPa. Hence these boulders are unlikely to fragment during the collection process given the\nmagnitude of the forces applied by the capture system mechanisms.\n\nFigure 7: Itokawa and Boulders (Image Credit: JAXA).\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 8. Observed Boulder Population on Itokawa (Credit: Ref. 11).\n\nVI. Capture Module Design and Options\nThe Capture Module provides all of the functions necessary to perform the following key functions: 1) asteroid\nand boulder characterization; 2) onboard asteroid- and boulder-relative navigation; 3) asteroid surface interaction; 4)\nboulder capture; 5) boulder restraint during the return flight; and 6) enhanced support of crew extra-vehicular\nactivity (EVA), including robotic preparation of the work site prior to crew arrival and between EVAs, and potential\nrobotic collection and caching of boulder surface and sub-surface samples for crew evaluation, collection, and return\nto Earth. Further details on the capture system design options investigated for Option B can be found in Ref. 15.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, several boulder collection options have been considered that focus of surface contact\noperations and actuator type. The two surface interaction options investigated are sustained contact (or \xe2\x80\x9clanding\xe2\x80\x9d)\nand hovering. In the contact option, the Capture Module provides relative navigation information to the Mission\nModule, which commands SEP Module chemical thrusters to descend to the boulder site with the contact arms (or\n\xe2\x80\x9clegs\xe2\x80\x9d) straddling the boulder, and thrusters maintaining continuous contact with the asteroid surface. The capture\narm(s) are then used to collect the boulder.\nIn the hover option, the Capture Module provides relative navigation information to the Mission Module, which\ncommands SEP Module chemical thrusters to hover over the boulder, while the capture arm(s) secure the boulder.\nThis option removes the need for landing legs, but also stresses the vehicle Guidance, Navigation and Control\n(GN&C) subsystem more, and increases the potential for regolith/dust ejection from the asteroid surface due to the\nincreased requirement for thrusting towards the surface.\nThe actuator type options shown in Fig. 9 are Spaceframes, robotic arms, and a hybrid system including both. In\nthe Spaceframe only configuration, 3- or 4-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) trusses articulated by linear actuators are\narranged in two configurations (legs and capture arms) of three appendages each to perform the surface contact and\nboulder capture functions. In the arm-only configuration, identical 7-DOF arms are used. The hybrid configuration\nuses both systems, with three Spaceframe surface contact arms and two robotic capture arms.\nThe hybrid version of the Capture Module includes the following subsystems to perform the functions described\nabove: Relative Navigation Subsystem; Robot Subsystem; Contact and Restraint System (CRS); Avionics\nSubsystem; and Mechanical Subsystem. Current mission refinement efforts are focused on the hybrid option, which\nis discussed in detail below.\nThe Relative Navigation Subsystem (RNS) consists of a highly capable sensor suite, and data processing\nalgorithms (hosted in the Avionics Subsystem\xe2\x80\x99s SpaceCube computers) to perform both the machine vision and\nfiltering required for onboard Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN). The fully redundant sensor suite consists of three\nhigh-definition cameras with differing field of views and a 3D LIDAR. The Narrow Field of View (NFOV) and\nMedium Field of View (MFOV) cameras are located on a side mounted two-axis gimbal to provide high-resolution\nmapping during asteroid flybys and extended horizon views for onboard navigation during the descent and planetary\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9: Proximity Operations and Capture Module Options (Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\ndefense demonstration phases. The Wide Field of View (WFOV) and LIDAR are fixed to the nadir deck of the\nCapture Module to provide imagery of the boulder though descent and capture. Fig. 10 describes the sensor\ncapabilities and architecture as it pertains to the Proximity Operations, which are discussed in Section VII.\nThe Robot Subsystem design consists of two 7-DOF arms currently under development at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Satellite\nServicing Capabilities Office (SSCO) for use on proposed satellite servicing missions. The arms take advantage of\nan extensive development program and include a new SSCO-designed Advanced Tool Drive System (ATDS).16 The\nATDS includes tool change out capability, several tool drives, and two pointable cameras to provide imagery of the\nboulder and robotic workspace. The boulder capture end-effector tool is the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) Microspine\nGripper, which uses hundreds of fishhook-like spines to opportunistically grab the surface features of natural\nobjects.17 Fig. 11 shows the configurations of the 7-DOF Arm and Microspine Gripper (different scales). The robot\nsubsystem also allows for boulder examination and sample preparation while in transit to cislunar space. After\ncollecting the boulder and ascending from the surface, the arms position the boulder for restraint in the Contact and\nRestraint Subsystem (CRS), which is described below, and then can stow the Microspine tool and acquire other tools\nfor boulder characterization and sample collection and caching. The crew\xe2\x80\x99s EVA time during the ARCM will be\nvery limited and any site work done before the crew\xe2\x80\x99s arrival will relieve the crew of the need to perform lengthy\ncoring and other sample gathering tasks.\nThe Contact and Restraint Subsystem (CRS) is required to arrest the descent of the spacecraft and stabilize it on\nthe surface of the asteroid, as well as providing the means of departing the surface using a mechanical push-off. This\napproach has been investigated to avoid directly pluming the surface of the NEA with the RCS so as to minimize\ncontaminating the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s solar arrays and other sensitive components with dust or larger particles. The CRS\ndesign shown in Fig. 12 consists of a set of three Spaceframe arms, each with three degrees of freedom and contact\npads at their tips. The contact pads accommodate geological/geographical context sample collectors to accompany\nthe captured boulder.\n\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 10: Option B Proximity Operations Sensor Suite and Operations.\n\nd Micro\nFigure 11: 7-DOF Arms and Microspine End Effector at Different Scales (Image Credits: NASA/JPL).\nWith the micro-gravity environment and the centrifugal force due to the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s rotation it was also assumed\nthat \xe2\x80\x9clanding\xe2\x80\x9d would be preferred for stability and operational simplicity with the RCS firing to provide additional\nforce against the surface to further accommodate the reaction forces of capturing the boulder. To reduce the\nlikelihood of pluming the surface with the RCS while descending, the contact arms are designed to absorb the\nmomentum of the spacecraft using electrically driven linear actuators. Those same actuators are used to provide the\npush-off force needed to depart the surface with the captured boulder.\nThe CRS is shown in its extended position after launch in Fig. 12 and consists of three segments each built from\naluminum tube stock of welded construction to form a no-wall open truss, or space frame. Segment rotation joints\nconsist of spherical bearings providing rotational freedom with axial constraint while allowing for structural\ndistortion from thermal expansion and contact with the irregular surface of the boulder. Flight heritage linear\nactuators are used to provide the high forces needed to drive the lengthy segments against the boulder and for the\ncontact arms during descent and ascent. The boulder restraint requirement poses a challenge due to the wide variety\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 12: CRS in Extended Position (Post Launch).\nof sizes and shapes of boulder it has to accommodate. The requirement of having to capture and restrain a spheroidal\nshape with various aspect ratios and ranging in major dimensions from 1 to 4 meters required numerous design\niterations. The result is three identical arms with three different length segments and three different joint angle\nranges all driven by three identical actuators. The design is a minimalistic method requiring no end effectors and is\nanalogous to a large three finger end effector mounted to the nadir face of the spacecraft. The CRS also provides a\nladder-like structure that can be used to assist in crew translation, stabilization and tool tethering while performing\nEVAs.\nThe Avionics Subsystem consists of three SpaceCube 2.0 data processors, one Vision Distribution and Storage\nUnit (VSDU), and one Remote Interface Unit (RIU). The SpaceCubes host all relative navigation and robotic\ncontrol software in a 2-for-3 redundant configuration. The VSDU provides image storage and compression, and\nserves as a video router for all of the sensors, transmitting live, raw imagery to the SpaceCube and live or stored\ncompressed video and other high speed telemetry to the Mission Module communications system for transmission to\nthe ground. The RIU provides power switching services and miscellaneous other services to the payload.\nThe Mechanical Subsystem consists of the Capture Module structure, thermal hardware (heaters and payload\navionics radiators), and all other miscellaneous hardware required to perform the Capture Module-allocated\nfunctions.\n\nVII. Proximity Operations\nThe proximity operations for Option B consist of four phases: 1.) Approach and Characterization; 2.) Dry-runs;\n3.) Boulder Collection; and 4.) Planetary Defense Demonstration via the Enhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT) method.\nThese operations are summarized here and are discussed in further detail in Ref. 18. For the Itokawa case study\nthese operations require 400 days that include 50 days of asteroid and boulder characterization, 20 days of\noperations for the initial boulder collection attempt, 50 days of contingency operations in the event the initial\nboulder collection attempt is not successful, 260 days for demonstration and verification of EGT technique, and 20\ndays of margin. While the timeline for the main operations is shorter than the proximity operations for other robotic\nasteroid missions (e.g., OSIRIS-REx and Hayabusa), ARRM Option B relies heavily on the experience gained from\npreviously flown missions and the extensive research and planning that has already been conducted during the\npreparation of future missions. Purposefully drawing from this knowledge minimizes mission unique operations and\nsubsequently reduces mission risk. This was necessary in part because the operations timeline is also constrained by\nthe competing desires to demonstrate a measureable deflection of an asteroid using a slow-push/pull technique,\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwhich takes significant time, and the desire to maximize the returned mass. As discussed earlier, any additional stay\ntime at the asteroid for proximity operations reduces the return time of flight, which in turn reduces the boulder mass\nthat the ARV EPS is capable of returning by the desired return date.\nThe Approach and Characterization Phase is depicted in Fig. 13 and begins at a range of around 1,000 km where\nthe incoming trajectory will follow a straight line with a 45 degree Sun-Asteroid-ARV angle to 100 km and will last\n14 days. During this time the lighting angle allows for good optical tracking by the NFOV cameras in order to refine\nthe asteroid ephemeris and shape models. This phase also facilitates an update of the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s attitude and spin\nstates from previous knowledge. In the case of Itokawa, this prior knowledge is fairly precise and would require\nonly minor updates. However, if the target is a previously unvisited asteroid with only ground-based information,\ndetailed shape and spin models will need to be developed in real time.\nAfter the global characteristics are determined, detailed mapping of the surface, potential boulders, and the\ngravity field is conducted through a series of fly-bys. The fly-bys each have a close approach distance of about 1 km\nand close approach velocities decreasing from 1.0 m/s to 0.1 m/s. Targeting different areas of the asteroid and\ndifferent lighting conditions, the NFOV and MFOV cameras on the 2-axis gimbal will map the entire surface to\nidentify landmarks to be used by the TRN system while targeting close approach imaging on potential boulder\ncollection sites. During these close approaches the cameras will provide centimeter-level resolution of the potential\ntarget boulders and the surrounding terrain. Seven days are allocated between each close approach to allow for\ndownlink, ground processing, and uplink of targeting updates for the next fly-by.\nReducing the speed of the fly-bys allows more imaging time at higher resolution and also helps to refine the\nknowledge of the gravity field. Four fly-bys will provide adequate imaging time and gravity knowledge for Itokawa\nand other targets that have precursors, providing quality gravity models and imagery to identify potential target\nboulders. For previously un-visited NEAs, additional fly-bys will be needed to refine shape and spin models,\ndevelop detailed gravity models, and identify potential target boulders.\nFollowing the fly-bys, the primary boulder target will be selected based on all the imagery and data collected. At\nthis point the dry-run sequence will begin. In order to set a common point for each dry-run and descent trajectory to\nfollow the same path a \xe2\x80\x9cHome Point\xe2\x80\x9d was designated at a range of 5 km and a 45 degree sun angle. Rather than hold\nposition at this point, The ARV will simply pass through it at the beginning of each sequence. Once the command to\nbegin the first dry-run is received, the ARV will maneuver to this point and then it will begin a passively-safe\ntrajectory toward Waypoint 1 (WP1), which is defined to be outside of the bounding sphere of the asteroid and will\nbe the point where, after passing through it, the ARV will begin targeting the surface. As shown in Fig. 14, an\nIntermediate Waypoint (IWP) was added for Itokawa due its highly non-spherical shape. This allows a passivelysafe trajectory from the Home Point to Waypoint 1 through this Intermediate Waypoint regardless of the spin state\nof Itokawa. This conservative operation is not needed as asteroids become more spherical.\nOnce the ARV arrives at Waypoint 1, the first dry-run is complete and the ARV completes a \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out Of\nDodge\xe2\x80\x9d (GOOD) Maneuver that is a scripted, previously loaded maneuver to send the ARV on a slow drift\ntrajectory away from the asteroid. Over the next seven days, the ARV will downlink telemetry data and imagery that\nwill provide sub-centimeter resolution of the boulder and surrounding terrain, as well as updates to the boulder-local\ngravity field.\nThe ARV will then proceed back to the Home Point (HP) where it will begin the second dry-run by following\nthe same path to Waypoint 1. From here the ARV will proceed to Waypoint 2 (WP2), which is at an altitude of 50 m\n\nFigure 13: Approach and Characterization Phase.\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 14: Dry-Run and Descent Trajectories.\ndirectly above the target boulder. In order to validate the closed-loop TRN and control algorithms, the ARV matches\nthe asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s spin rate and performs a short hold at Waypoint 2 while maintaining position directly above the\nboulder. This hold also allows the collection of additional high-resolution images under lighting conditions that will\nbe seen during final descent and local gravity models to be validated. After the hold, another GOOD maneuver is\nexecuted, the data is downloaded and the ARV returns to the Home Point for the beginning of the boulder collection\noperations.\nThe boulder collection sequence begins by following the same path from the Home Point to Waypoint 2, at\nwhich point the ARV begins a vertical descent maintaining position directly above the boulder to Waypoint 3 (20 m\naltitude). This descent, as well as the descent from Waypoint 3 (WP3) to the surface, will rely solely on closed-loop\nTRN from the nadir-pointing WFOV camera and LIDAR tracking the boulder, as well as the side-looking NFOV\nand MFOV cameras that will be tracking other surface landmarks. At Waypoint 3 the vertical velocity may be nulled\nand from this point down to the surface there will nominally be no thrusting toward to the asteroid to prevent\npluming contamination and debris creation. For a slow spinning asteroid such as Itokawa, the gravity is enough to\novercome the centripetal acceleration and slowly pull the ARV towards the surface. For faster rotators, the ARV\nmay need to use RCS jets to overcome the centripetal acceleration in order to descend to the surface while\nmaintaining position directly above the boulder.\nUpon contact, the CRS will attenuate the residual velocity and bring the ARV to rest on the surface. For Itokawa,\nthis residual velocity was less than 5 cm/s for a collection site on the Muses Sea. For faster spinners which require\n15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nthrusting to descend, the contact velocity can be tailored even lower. While on the surface and throughout the\ncollection operations, the RCS thrusters will provide a net ~1 N of thrust above what is required to maintain contact.\nThis will provide additional stability and keep the thrusters warm should additional thrust be needed due to forces\nexperienced during boulder collection.\nAfter the boulder is securely captured, the CRS will be used to push off the surface to break the cohesion\nbetween the boulder and the surface and to impart an initial velocity to the combined ARV and boulder system.\nNominally this velocity will be slightly above escape velocity to put the ARV on a slow drift trajectory away from\nthe asteroid. If escape velocity is not met, RCS thrusters will be used to add the required impulse. During the first 50\nmeters of ascent, the ARV will use the RCS sparingly only to null any tip rates in order to ensure the solar arrays\nwill not contact the surface. Past this point the RCS will remove the residual motion to achieve a sun-pointing\nattitude.\nAt this point the boulder has been captured, full solar power has been restored, a high-bandwidth\ncommunications link with Earth is established for downlink, and the ARV is on a passively-safe trajectory away\nfrom the asteroid. Prior to any significant maneuvers, a series of small burns will be executed in order to refine the\nmass properties of the combined system. For the hybrid capture system, the CRS then performs the restraint\nsequence as the ARV with updated mass properties maneuvers to complete the ascent phase.\nWith the boulder restrained, the ARV begins a three-week orbit determination period to refine the postinteraction asteroid orbit prior to the planetary defense demonstration. The baseline planetary defense technique for\nOption B is the Enhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT) technique. As shown in Fig. 15, the EGT technique investigated\nuses a halo orbit around the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s orbital velocity vector ( ) with the SEP thrusters throttling to match the\ngravitational force and maintain a constant separation. The gravitational attraction along the radial vector ( ) results\nin a net force along the velocity vector. The halo orbit is designed with a radius (y) to maintain a safe minimum\ndistance from the NEA and eliminate pluming of the surface (325 m for Itokawa operations). The halo orbit\neliminates the need for large thruster gimbal angles that would be required if the ARV maintained position along the\nvelocity vector to avoid pluming on the NEA and negating the gravitational attraction between the ARV and the\nNEA. For Itokawa with a nominal 7 t boulder, 90 days of tractoring is required in order to achieve a measurable\ndeflection with 3- certainty. The nominal timeline and propellant budget includes 180 days of tractoring to provide\nmargin for any contingencies periods where the ARV would enter into a safe mode and temporarily halt tractoring\nactivities. The estimated tractoring period required to achieve a measurable deflection if no boulder is collected is\nachievable by increasing the tractoring time to 180 days.\nFollowing the tractoring activities, the ARV will maneuver to a safe distance and wait for the achieved\ndeflection to propagate and for proper orbital alignment with Earth for verification of the deflection. The verification\nwill be achieved through direct range measurements of the ARV combined with the relative range measurements\nbetween the ARV and the asteroid.\n\nFigure 15: EGT Demonstration Orbital Geometry (Itokawa Image Credit: JAXA).\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nVIII. Planetary Defense Demonstration Options\nOne of the key findings of the 2010 National Research Council Committee report titled \xe2\x80\x9cDefending Planet Earth:\nNear-Earth Object Surveys and Hazard Mitigation Strategies\xe2\x80\x9d was that \xe2\x80\x9cno single approach to mitigation is\nappropriate and adequate for completely preventing the effects of the full range of potential impactors, although civil\ndefense is an appropriate component of mitigation in all cases. With adequate warning, a suite of four types of\nmitigation is adequate to mitigate the threat from nearly all NEOs except the most energetic ones.\xe2\x80\x9d19 Besides civil\ndefense as a mitigation technique, the three planetary defense techniques highlighted in the report were gravity\ntractor as a slow push/pull technique, along with kinetic impactor and nuclear detonation as rapid \xe2\x80\x9cimpulsive\xe2\x80\x9d\ntechniques.\nAs mentioned above, the primary planetary defense demonstration proposed for ARRM Option B is the\nEnhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT), which uses the collected boulder to augment the mass of the ARV. Additional\napproaches, such as a Kinetic Impactor (KI) or Ion Beam Deflection (IBD) can also be performed during the\nmission. The KI demonstration requires the addition of a secondary impacting spacecraft to be launched with the\nARV or separately, along with the coordination of the impactor to strike the NEA near the end of the NEA visit. A\nKI demonstration in this manner is not applicable to Option A. The IBD approach utilizes the ion plasma from the\nSEP thrusters to impinge against the NEA\xe2\x80\x99s surface and impart a force on the target. The effectiveness of the EGT\nand IBD approaches for a given size NEA primarily depends on the mass of the collected boulder and the SEP\nthruster plume divergence, respectively. Additionally, the collection of engineering data during surface interaction\nand the potential for testing some of the hardware and operations that would be applicable to a nuclear detonation is\nalso possible for Option B.\nThere are a number of reasons for selecting EGT for demonstration on Option B of the ARRM. First, the\napproach minimizes additional mission costs and risks to demonstrate a viable PD technique by leveraging the\ncollected boulder mass, which is nominally being acquired. Second, it is relevant to hazardous-size NEAs with an\nefficiency that increases as the boulder and NEA masses increase. For an NEA the size of Itokawa, EGT requires\nless time than IBD to impart a specified \xe2\x88\x86V on the target if a sufficiently massive boulder is captured, and uses\napproximately half the propellant required for IBD (~300 kg vs. ~600 kg) since the IBD approach requires\npropulsive capability to compensate for the reaction force of the plasma beam directed at the NEA. Fig. 16 provides\na comparison of the EGT with 10 t and 20 t boulders and the IBD to impart a 0.1 mm/s \xe2\x88\x86V on a range of NEAs\nsizes. Finally, the EGT technique allows the ARV to maintain safe, constant distance from NEA after retrieval while\ndemonstrating extended proximity operations near the asteroid.\n\nFigure 16. Enhanced Gravity Tractor Compared to Ion Beam Deflection to Impart \xe2\x88\x86V=0.1 mm/s.\n17\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe use of the mass collected in-situ and the ability of multiple ARVs to orbit in formation to provide the\nnecessary velocity change greatly increases the applicability of the EGT technique, which allows, with sufficient\nwarning time the EGT technique to be used to divert hazardous NEAs. For an actual deflection mission to avoid a\nfuture Earth impact, the collected NEA material, which could be a single boulder, multiple boulders, or regolith,\nwould not need to be returned to Earth. Therefore, significantly more mass could be collected to provide mass\naugmentation than cannot be achieved during the ARRM. With the current thrust levels available from the EPS,\nimparting a V of 0.5 cm/s on an Itokawa-size NEA (~320 m equivalent diameter) with a single ARV could be\naccomplished with the collection of ~275 t of asteroidal material and would require ~3.4 years of tractoring and ~6 t\nof xenon propellant. However, two ARVs working in tandem would only require ~1.7 years and ~3 t of propellant\neach. Without the collected mass, a single ARV would need 120 years and ~15 t of xenon propellant to impart the\nsame velocity change. It should be noted that these estimates are based on a fixed ARV mass. In actuality the ARV\nmass would change as the propellant load is consumed, but it would still be dominated by the mass of the collected\nmaterial.\n\nIX. Programmatic Robustness and Development\nThe ARRM Option B mission and flight system have been designed to allow the mission to be robust\nprogrammatically. The robust target set and scalability of the capture system allows the mission to be robust to\nlaunch date, providing NASA with flexibility in when and how to execute the mission. The functions have been\ndistributed within the modular flight system and Capture Module in ways that allow the schedule risk to be\nminimized while also accommodating the use of different providers for each module. The Capture Module cost and\nschedule reserve allocations are also appropriately sized for a mission in formulation, with schedule reserves\ncomplying with established design principles and cost reserves margin in excess of 34% for all three Capture\nModule concepts.\nThe NEA target set available to the mission allows a multi-ton return mass for a wide range of departure and\nreturn dates, as shown in Table 1 in Section IV. This rich target set availability provides NASA with flexibility in\nterms of when the mission is provided with authority to proceed and the planned development duration, allowing the\nmission to more easily accommodate potential budget profiles and reducing the impact of potential budget\nuncertainties. In addition, once design and development has started, the availability of multiple targets provides\nmission management options in the event of new information attained from planned precursors or unforeseen issues.\nOnce launched, boulder target selection and return mass can be also adjusted, providing the mission with the\nflexibility to increase the value in response to internal or external factors. For example, in the event of changes to the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s planned crew launch cadence after an ARMM Option B launch, the mission could pursue the capture of\nlarger boulders by slipping the planned return date.\nThe design, build, integration, and test schedule for the ARRM Option B Capture Module has been structured to\nallow an integrated test of the Capture Module to occur prior to system-level Integration and Test (I&T), and\nminimize the impact of many of the module subsystems on the module critical path. The desire for an integrated test\nof the Capture Module led to the modular structure described in Section III, with the Capture Module functionality\nincluding all critical capture systems. For the Hybrid and Spaceframe options, the Spaceframe capture/contact arms\ndesign, development, integration, and test activities are the Capture Module\xe2\x80\x99s critical path. To minimize the duration\nof that path, the module I&T plan, shown in Fig. 17, has been structured so that the other module subsystems will be\nintegrated and tested prior to the integration of the Spaceframe arms for final module I&T.\nCapture Module I&T (Part 1)\nMechanical, Avionics, & Prox Ops\nSubsystems; 7-DOF Robot Arms\n\nCapture Module I&T (Part 2)\n+ Spaceframe Arms\n\nSEP Module Fab & Integration\nARV System Integration\n\nARV System Test\n\nMission Module Fab & Integration\n\nFigure 17. ARRM Option B I&T Approach for Hybrid Capture Module.\n18\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nX. ARRM Extensibility\nThis Asteroid Redirect Mission includes aspects of extensibility related to both the robotic and crewed segments.\nThis paper summarizes the extensibility of the ARRM. Please refer to Ref. 20 for a detailed discussion of ARCM\nand ARRM extensibility. For the ARRM, extensibility falls into three general categories for both future human and\nrobotic missions. The first is Extended Missions where the ARV, as designed, is used for post-ARCM human and\nrobotics missions by NASA, commercial, academic and/or international partners. Included in this first category\nwould also be an \xe2\x80\x9cend-of-life mission\xe2\x80\x9d where the ARV by itself or along with any remaining asteroidal material\nwould perform a final mission of interest near the end of its operational lifetime. An example of this would be the\nuse of the ARV and leftover asteroidal mass to demonstrate the kinetic impactor technique on an asteroid or comet.\nThe second category is Augmented Missions where the ARV is used in conjunction with additional\nvehicles/modules to enhance the available capabilities. An example of this would be the addition of a pressurized\nmodule to provide additional habitable volume for crewed visits in cislunar space. A second example of an\naugmented mission would be to utilize a modified version of the Capture Module with existing SEP and Mission\nModules to return a boulder from one of the Martian moons as depicted in Fig. 18. This second example assumes\nthat sufficient propellant is available to conduct this mission. Having the option to refuel the ARV (RCS and SEP)\nwould be extremely valuable and provide the ability maximize the benefits and use of the ARV for both of these\ncategories. The final category is Evolved Missions where advanced versions of the ARV modules and subsystems,\nincluding higher power SEP would be used to perform future robotic or human missions which require significantly\nincreased capabilities. A robotic mission to the Martian moons could also be included in this category as a follow-on\nmission to ARRM using an evolved version of the ARV (e.g., additional power and xenon propellant). A second\nexample of this would be the use of a higher power SEP Module and Capture Module subsystems to deliver a\nhabitat to surface of Phobos to support a human mission to the Mars system as depicted in Fig. 19.\n\nFigure 18. Extensibility of ARV to Boulder Retrieval at Phobos (Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\n\nFigure 19. Concept for Evolved ARV Integrated with a Phobos Surface Habitat\n(Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\n19\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nA. Solar Electric Propulsion\nThe ARV, with 50 kW solar arrays and a 40-kW electric propulsion system with the capacity to hold\napproximately 10 metric tons of usable xenon propellant, is a spacecraft that is very capable for use in future human\nand robotic exploration missions. These missions are wide-ranging and include supporting long-duration human\nmissions in cislunar space to interplanetary robotic exploration of the solar system. The ARV modules and\nsubsystems, through modularity and scalability, can be evolved to facilitate more demanding missions such as cargo\ndelivery and human missions to Mars. Human Mars missions will require higher power solar arrays and electric\npropulsion systems. The current ARV and/or its subsystems could be used in a modular manner or upgraded as the\ntechnologies advance. The solar array systems being developed are planned to be extensible to 125 kW per wing.\nThis increased power can either be combined with a greater number of EPS strings at the current power and thrust\nlevels or with more capable electric propulsion systems. Current solar array and electric propulsion systems\ntechnology maturation efforts by STMD for the ARRM will advance these critical technologies to enable moredemanding NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions in the future and will advance high-efficiency in-space propulsion that can be\nincorporated into commercial spacecraft.\nB. Capture Module\nThe use of Capture Module\xe2\x80\x99s subsystems to interact with an asteroid and capture a boulder from its surface has\nmany applications to future NASA missions as well as commercial companies and international partners. The\nextensible activities include satellite servicing and refueling, providing surface contact and manipulation for a future\ncrewed mission to NEAs or the Martian moons, and providing critical experience operating around and on a lowgravity planetary body. The use of planned routines with fault tolerance for asteroid surface contact and boulder\ncollection operations will be required for future autonomous operations in deep space. In addition, the Microspine\ntechnology can be used for future robotic exploration of lava tubes on the Moon and Mars, Martian cliffs, and lowgravity bodies like NEAs, Phobos, Deimos, and Ceres. The hybrid approach optimizes functionality and maximizes\nextensibility of the concept. Fig. 20 provides a depiction of how the Capture Module subsystems could be utilized as\npart the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) on the surface of Phobos.\n\nFigure 20. MMSEV with ARV Capture Module Subsystems on the Surface of Phobos\n(Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\nC. Asteroid Resource Utilization\nWater is a critical resource for future human space exploration and can be used for a variety of purposes,\nincluding propellants, radiation shielding, thermal control, human consumption, as well as a variety of non-potable\napplications (cleaning, plant growth, etc.). Carbonaceous asteroids may contain up to 20% water by mass in the form\nof hydrated minerals and a similar mass percentage of other extractable volatiles (e.g., carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and\ncarbon monoxide). Carbonaceous asteroids also have low compressive strength. This property simplifies cutting,\ncrushing, and processing, which could be a key target attribute for resource extraction and recovery. Oxygen from\nmineral oxides, metals (e.g., iron, nickel, and platinum group metals), and bulk materials that can be used for\nradiation shielding and the construction of various structures are also plentiful in NEAs.\nDetermining the composition of the target NEA is critical and targeting a large, well-characterized carbonaceous\nNEA in Option B significantly increases the potential for returning water/volatile-rich material. Returning the right\ntype of asteroidal material to cislunar space would allow ISRU demonstrations to be conducted to determine how\n20\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nsuccessfully the bulk asteroidal material may be converted into useful products. This would be enabling for future\nhuman exploration of the solar system and could be critical in advancing commercial efforts to mine asteroids. In\naddition to resource extraction, the analysis and understanding of water and water-bearing minerals from asteroids is\nextremely important to our understanding of solar system formation and the origins of life on Earth.\nD. Planetary Defense\nAlthough slow push/pull planetary defense techniques, such as gravity tractor and ion beam deflection, may be\ndemonstrated as part of both ARRM options, the relevance and extensibility of the techniques are significantly\nimproved by conducting a mission to a hazardous-size NEA. The size of NEA targeted by the Option A is below the\nthreshold that can typically survive entry through the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, and therefore is not of a hazardous-size.\nOption B provides critical planetary defense experience by operating at a large NEA, both through sustained orbital\noperations and extended surface interactions. It also allows the demonstration of the Enhanced Gravity Tractor\n(EGT) that can be used to significantly reduce the operational time needed for this approach to be effective against\nan actual impactor. Finally, the option to demonstrate a kinetic impact technique, which is the most likely option for\nan impactor with limited warning time, is only available with Option B.\nThe additional extensible approach for planetary defense that can be derived from the ARRM is the use of the\nARV and the captured boulder to act as a kinetic impactor against an asteroid or comet threat. This option needs\nfurther investigation to determine the extent of its applicability, but with sufficient xenon propellant reserves, or the\nability to refuel the ARV, having this asset in the Earth-Moon system could provide a basic \xe2\x80\x9con call\xe2\x80\x9d planetary\ndefense capability. The reality is that that no dedicated planetary defense system exists and funding one is unlikely\ndue to the infrequency of Earth impacts. Developing the technologies, systems, and operational approaches for\nefficiently moving large amounts of useful asteroidal material and for facilitating its processing and utilization also\nhelps us to be prepared to divert a future impactor. The ARRM provides a critical first step to an integrated solution\nto planetary defense by leveraging the resources of NEAs and their economic potential.\n\nXI. Summary and Forward Work\nThe Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission is a critical component of NASA's Asteroid Initiative. The mission\noption of robotically capturing a multi-ton boulder from the surface of a larger NEA and returning it to cislunar\nspace best addresses a broad set of stakeholder interests, including human exploration, science, planetary defense,\nand commercial and international partnerships. Option B can leverage precursor missions and existing Agency\ncapabilities to provide an attractive set of candidate NEAs that are robust to changes in launch and return dates. The\noption provides centimeter-level characterization over an entire large NEA and sub-centimeter level characterization\nof multiple candidate boulders prior to selection and capture. Option B also provides the opportunity for hosted\npayloads from commercial, academic, and international partners. This ARRM option provides critical experience\noperating at a low-gravity planetary body, including extended surface interactions and the ability to demonstrate\nmultiple deflection strategies on a hazardous-size NEA, including the option to test a kinetic impact approach.\nFinally, targeting a large, well-characterized NEA significantly increases the potential for returning water/volatilerich material from a carbonaceous NEA, which could be instrumental in advancing the fledgling asteroid mining\nindustry.\nWork on the ARRM Option B approach is continuing through a series of risk reduction tasks combined with\nadditional mission design and analyses. A multi-center NASA team is currently focused on the design of the hybrid\noption, refining the proximity operations, performing expanded mission design for candidate NEAs, and testing key\naspects of the approach. These activities are being conducted in preparation for a mission downselect between\nOptions A and B planned in December of 2014 and a Mission Concept Review in February of 2015.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the entire cross-Agency team for the tremendous amount of work that has been\nperformed on the Robotic Boulder Capture Option for ARRM.
