An example of NASA/university cooperation is the work of the Space Technology Center at the University of Kansas (KU) and the KU Center for Research, Inc. (CRINC). Directed by Professor Bill G. Barr, the Space Technology Center is one of 27 interdisciplinary centers established as part of a NASA plan to set up a network of advanced facilities across the nation. Since 1981 CRINC has been involved in a technology transfer program supported by the NASA Technology Utilization Division and by industry. The objective of the technology transfer program is to encourage industrial innovation through utilization of NASA technology through improved industry/university cooperation. At KU, research is conducted by the Industrial Innovation Laboratory and the Computer Integrated Manufacturing Laboratory which utilize graduate students in engineering and computer science as research assistants. A new project of the Space Technology Center is one designed to advance NASA objectives in \"augmented telerobotics.\" A telerobot is programmed to respond to commands from a human operator, or to mimic the movements of its human operator. The project is being conducted under the guidance of Langley Research Center.", "title": "NASA/University Technology Cooperation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086929, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086929, "id": "8b7b1513f1e44c9faf70582e38cb7d5f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086929.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086929/downloads/20020086929.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086929/downloads/20020086929.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086929/downloads/20020086929.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
