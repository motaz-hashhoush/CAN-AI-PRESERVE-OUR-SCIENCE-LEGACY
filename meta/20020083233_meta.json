Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully developed a non-chemical system that not only curbed scale and corrosion, but also offered advantages in water conservation, cost savings and the elimination of toxic chemical discharge. In the system, ozone is produced by an on-site generator and introduced to the cooling tower water. Organic impurities are oxidized, and the dissolved ozone removes bacteria and scale. National Water Management, a NASA licensee, has installed its ozone advantage systems at some 200 cooling towers. Customers have saved money and eliminated chemical storage and discharge.", "title": "Technology for Water Treatment (National Water Management)", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083233, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083233, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "cda29c203daa43d196d1a99870fcb774", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083233.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083233/downloads/20020083233.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083233/downloads/20020083233.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083233/downloads/20020083233.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
