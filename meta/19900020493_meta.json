S&P acquires and tracks the position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity of a slowly spinning satellite, and sends tracking data to the MCM subsystem. MCM grapples the satellite and brings it to rest, controlling the arms so that no excessive forces or torques are exerted on the satellite or arms. A 350-pound satellite mockup which can spin freely on a gimbal for several minutes, closely simulating the dynamics of a real satellite is demonstrated. The satellite mockup is fitted with a panel under which may be mounted various elements such as line replacement modules and electrical connectors that will be used to demonstrate servicing tasks once the satellite is docked. The subsystems are housed in three MicroVAX II microcomputers. The hardware of the S&P Subsystem includes CCD cameras, video digitizers, frame buffers, IMFEX (a custom pipelined video processor), a time-code generator with millisecond precision, and a MicroVAX II computer. Its software is written in Pascal and is based on a locally written vision software library. The hardware of the MCM Subsystem includes PUMA 560 robot arms, Lord force/torque sensors, two MicroVAX II computers, and unimation pneumatic parallel grippers. Its software is written in C, and is based on a robot language called RCCL. The two subsystems are described and test results on the grappling of the satellite mockup with rotational rates of up to 2 rpm are provided.", "title": "Autonomous sensor-based dual-arm satellite grappling", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900020493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilcox, Brian"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "b073e43e3daa4dbba632ff3e40803585"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900020493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tso, Kam"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "873f776f7ddb44d2918c2d85bacd5c60"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900020493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Litwin, Todd"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "c74d23c7a9f0454eba387ffbc2c7add7"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19900020493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hayati, Samad"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "19150212881f4f8cbcfbb69393444121"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19900020493, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bon, Bruce"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "391ae818db994dd297b228214fd3ffb1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900020493, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900020493, "id": "e478f0a2ace5452d827e89e8a0c63cca", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the NASA Conference on Space Telerobotics, Volume 3", "publicationDate": "1989-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900020493.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900020493/downloads/19900020493.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900020493/downloads/19900020493.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900020493/downloads/19900020493.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
