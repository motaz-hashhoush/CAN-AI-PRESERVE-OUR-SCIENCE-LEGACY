At the time of this writing, SpaceX has completed 14 missions to ISS with each returning to Earth via water landing. After each mission, a team from the NASA Johnson Space Center performs an inspection of the exterior surfaces of the Cargo Dragon spacecraft for hypervelocity impact damage features. Data from these inspections are collected into a database that includes impact feature dimensions as well as the location on the vehicle. Additional details on the type and size of particle that produced the damage site are pro-vided when sampling data and definitive spectroscopic analysis results are available. Observation data can be compared with impact estimates from risk assessment codes as a check on the micro-meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) environment predictions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190002583, "endDate": "2019-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Hypervelocity Impact Society", "location": "Austin, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "0dd7c2b25e70468d9e92d970aa3bda48", "id": "24a0b3c5c37e4071a6594b44b73a84e8"}], "name": "2019 Hypervelocity Impact Symposium", "location": "Destin, FL", "id": "0dd7c2b25e70468d9e92d970aa3bda48", "startDate": "2019-04-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190002583, "id": "3b6415bb6bbd4d2485f007503427993d", "publicationDate": "2019-04-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190002583.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190002583/downloads/20190002583.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190002583/downloads/20190002583.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190002583/downloads/20190002583.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
