The\nphoto to the left shows the results of\nwelding 0.0025"-thick sheets of\ncopper-nickel alloy foil. Used in aerospace, automotive, and many other\nindustries, the material was welded\nwith a Synrad Evolution\xe2\x84\xa2 125-watt\nlaser. The weld was made at a velocity\nof 110" per minute with a 2.5" focal\nlength lens having a spot size of\n0.004". Argon gas, at 2 psi, was used\nfor shielding.\n\nA weld created using a Synrad CO 2\nlaser on copper-nickel foil.\n\nThe key to achieving virtually no\nheat defonnation and a uniform weld\nbead is in selecting proper pu lsing\nparameters for the laser. In this case, a\npulse frequency of 685 Hz and a pulse\nlength of 880 microseconds provided\nthe weld characteristics desired.\nChanging the thickness or width of the\nweld bead is simply a matter of\nexperimenting with variations in beam\nvelocity, pu lse frequency, or pulse\nlength.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laser Cutting Urethane Bushings\nThe 2.5"-thick urethane bushing\nshown to the right was cut in nine\nseconds while being rotated underneath\na 240 watt CO 2 laser beam. Although a\nslight discoloration is present, no charring of the urethane material occurs.\nTo cut the material, a 7.5" focal\nlength lens with a 0.5" depth of focus\nand a 0.012" spot size was used. The\nbushing was rotated at 140 rpm during\ncutting, which took nine seconds (21\nrevolutions). Nitrogen assist gas at 20\npsi was used whi le cutting.\n\nThis Urethane Bushing was cut with\na 240 watt Synrad laser.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laser Marking Fast Bar Codes on Inked Paper\nThis 24 character Code 128 bar\ncode, including human-readable text,\nwas marked on inked paper in only one\nsecond! The bar code, measuring 1.5"\nlong by 0.5" high, was marked by a\nmarking head and Synrad laser driven\nby WinMark Pro\xe2\x84\xa2 laser marking\nsoftware. 20 watts of laser power were\nused to achieve a velocity of 250" per\nsecond.\n\nDiscover more CO2 laser applications!\nSign up for our monthly online\n\nApplications Newsletter at\nwww.synrad.com/signup1\n\nUsing a Synrad 25 watt marking\nsystem. these codes were\nmarked at 250" per second!\n\nAll applications on this page were\nprocessed at SYllrad\'s Applicatiolls\nLaboratory.

Hewlett-Packard\nused ALGOR\'s Mechanical Event Simulation (MES) software to\nanalyze the behavior of the magnetic recording tape as it is wound\nthrough a Hewlett-Packard LTO Ultrium back-up drive.\n\nThe Challenge\n\nA Hewlett-Packard engineer, Paul Poorman , modeled the magnetic\ntape with isotropic shell elements and the drive assembly using\nkinematic elements. In the MES, the tape wraps around two rollers\nand across a tape head and is then pulled into a take-up reel. The\nMES results showed the motion of the tape and resulting stresses.\nThese results helped Hewlett-Packard find a proprietary solution that\nkeeps the tape on track while reducing stresses on the edge of the\ntape, thus extending the life of the back-up tape. Paul Poorman\nreports, \'\'The first generation of Hewlett-Packard Ultrium drives is\ncurrently in the market and performing w~II."\n\nHewlett-Packard\'s challenge was to optimize the LTO drive to\nincrease tape durability while maintaining tape path stability. To study\nthe tape\'s behavior, the software had to simulate motion, contact\nbetween parts in an assembly, large displacement, elastic material\nbehavior and stresses.\n\nFor this complete story and others, visit\nhptapedrive.ALGOR.com\n\nautodesk\n\nauthorized deVfloper\n\nPTe\n\nEn_\n\n......\n\n----.-\n\nAll trademarks may be trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nUSA/Canada\n1.800.48.ALGOR\n\nALGOR.\nALGOR, lnc.\n150 Beta Drive\nPittsburgh , PA 15238-2932 USA\nPhone\n1.412.967.2700\nFax\n1.412.967 .2781\nhptapedrive@algor.com\nhptapedrlve.ALGOR.com\n\nFor Free Info Visit www.nasatech_\ncom/513 or Enter No. 513 at www.nasatech.comlrs\n\nFrance\n0.800 .918.917\nItaly\n800 .783.132\nSingapore\n800.120.3775\nUnited Kingdom\n0.800.731 .0399\n\nContents continued\n,gl\n~\n\nSystem for Detecting Hazardous Gases at Multiple\nLocations\n\n52\n\nTemperature-Compensation Method for HighTemperature Strain Gauges\n\n55\n\nInformation Sciences\n\n55\n\nWindowed Revocation of Public-Key-Encryption\nCertificates\n\n56\n\nBooks and Reports\n\n56\n\nMechanical Event Simulation for MEMS Design\n\n56\n\nNarrowband Tunable Optical Filter Using Fiber Bragg\nGratings\n\n56\n\nTechnical Background of Special Bus-Driver Software\n\n60\n\nMotion Control Tech Briefs\n\n60\n\nAdvances in Cooperative Transport by Two Mobile Robots\n\n62\n\nak\n\nPhysical Sciences\n\n52\n\nt)\n\n52\n\nMagnetostrictive Motor and Circuits for Robotic\nApplications\n\nPRODUCT\n\ncommercial product, process, or activity identified in this publication.\n\nTHE\n\nMONTH\n\nThe DGx~ digital recording system from\nRGB Spectrum, Alameda, CA, captures,\ncompresses, stores, and plays back\ncomputer, radar, and video images in\nhigh-resolution digital format.\n\n14\nON\n\nThis document was prepared under me sponsorship of me aliona!

We crystallize biological\nmacromolecules that are important in\nunderstanding how diseases are cau ed\nand how they can be stopped. From xray analysi of the crystals and a lot of\nhard work, we can get a picture of the\nmacromolecule.\nIn collaboration with Dr. Gloria\nBorgstahl at the University of Toledo, we\nhave been studying how the better ordering occurs and what ph ical effects that\nhas on the o-ystals. We have been looking\nat in ulin and developed new techniques\nto characterize the mi rogravity improvements rapidly and tali tically. ASA has\nprovided a grant to Dr. Borgstahl for this\nresearch, which has provided the eed\nfunding for further investigations into\nother macromolecules, notabl orne repon ible for cancer.\nNTB: What are the advantages of\ngrowing crystals on the International\nSpace Station?\nDr. Snell: Back in 1981, a sounding\nrocket wa used to grow a protein in microgravity while it was filmed with a special camera. During the hort period of\ngrowth, clear differences were een in\nthe growth from that on the ground.\nThe film showed mooth fluid flow\naround the crystal compared to turbulent convection on the ground. Our own\nstudies with six microgravity and six\nground-grown insulin crystals gave mi-\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\ncrogravity cry tals averaging 34 times\nlarger volume with even-fold improvement in cry tal quality, resulting in improved tructural detail.\nWe could grow the insulin Cl-ystal on\nthe hort duration of the huttle mision, but many crystal growth experiments need a longer time. The Space\nStation gives us thi time. It al 0 allow\nthe potential for a much more exciting\nexperiment. At present, when we grow\ncrystals in the laboratory, we look at the\nresults and start a new experiment u ing\nthe knowledge from our observations to\noptimize the crystal. Our first crystal\nmay not be uitable for X-ray analy i\nand several iteration may be needed.\nWith the shuttle, ou had to wait until it\ncame back, analyze the re ults, and wail\nuntil the next mission. With the long-duration missions of the Space tation we\nmay be able to do cience as we do it in\nthe laboratory. Our experiments are very\nsmall; over a hundred could fit in a hoebox. The potential from them is very\nhigh depending on the ample being\ntudied, which makes them ideal for microgravity.\nNTB: What will this research mean for\nthe treatment of cancer and diabetes?\nDr. Snell: tructural cry tallography\nprovide the picture of tl1e macromolecule. Once scientists have the picture,\nthey can understand how the macromolecule works and can design a drug to\ntop or aid its function. A lot of work has\ngone into improving the quality of life\nfor diabete patients. The in ulin we are\nstudying i part of that work. Work on\ncancer, for which Dr. Borgstahl has ju t\nreceived funding, will advance the\nknowledge of that di ease. With enough\nknowledge come tl1e treatment or cure,\nbut we\'ll have to wait a while, unfortunately. The whole proces from crystal to\ntructure, and maybe a new drug, takes\nmany years.

These fuel cells exploit the electrochemical oxidation of organic fuel\n(usually methanol) in air. Whereas\npower sources based on state-of-the-art\nlithium-ion batteries have specific energie of no more than =150 Wh / kg,\npower sources based on the present developmental fuel cells are expected to\nhave specific energies between 500 and\n1,000 W\xc2\xb7h/ kg. Moreover, whereas one\nmust often wait for batterie to be\nrecharged before using them, a fuel cell\ncan be refueled and used immediately.\nConventional fuel-cell assemblies include bipolar plate stacks, pumps, blowers, and other ancillary items that not\nonly contribute to cost but also add bulk\nand complexity, thereby posing considerable impediments to miniaturization.\nIn the pre ent developmental fuel cells,\nthe flat-pack configuration is part of an\noverall improved design that eliminate\nmuch of the bulk and complexity.\nA flat-pack fuel-cell assembly can include one or more fuel cells electrically\nconnected in serie and/ or parallel to\nobtain the required current and/ or voltage rating. A typical basic flat-pack fuelcell assembly (see figure) contains a single polymer electrolyte membrane that\nserves multiple cells. The cathodes of all\nthe cells are located side by side in the\nsame plane on one side of the membrane, while the anodes of all the cells\nare imilarly located on the other side of\nthe membrane. A fuel-feed manifold\nand a wick deliver fuel in regulated\namounts to the anodes. The cathodes\nare expo ed to air in a manner similar to\nthat of metal/ air batteries.\nSeries electrical connections between adjacent cells are made in the\nform of po ts that extend through the\nmembrane. These posts are made from\nsuch corrosion-re istant, electronically\nconductive materials as graphite, platinum, and/or gold, along with (if\nneeded) an appropriate table polymeric binder. Alternatively or in addi30\n\ntion , parallel and/or series electrical\nconnections among cells can be made\nin the form of thin edge connector\nplates that include egmented strip\nconductors made of gold or graphite.\nFabrication of a multiple-cell membrane/electrode assembly like that\nshown in the figure involves the application, to the membrane, of catalyst layers\nand backing structures for the anodes\nand cathodes. The techniques of fabrication include the use of catalyst inks\nand either the use of pre-coated electrodes or else sputter deposition of the\nelectrodes. Gas-diffusion backing layers\nare preferably bonded to the membrane\nby hot pressing. Optionally, nonbonded\nbacking layers can be used instead of\nbonded ones.\nThe preferred anode catalyst is Pt-Ru;\nthe preferred cathode catalyst is Pt. The\nanode structure is made hydrophilic so\nthat an aqueous olution of liquid organic fuel can readily flow to the cataly t\nlayer and the carbon dioxide product\n\ncan readily leave the anode surface. The\ncathode i made hydrophobic to exclude water and thereby facilitate the\nflow of air.\nThis work was done by S. R Narayanan,\nT. l.

Previou\nversions of the method provided for the\nevaluation of "crisp" topologie were\npreci ely specified by open/ closed\n(on / off) interconnection switches. The\npre ent, augmented version provides for\nevaluation of topologies specified by\nswitche that upport partial degree of\nopening. These "fuzzy" topologies with\npartly open, partly closed switches have\nbehaviors very similar to tho e obtained\nby a combination of "crisp" topologies.\nIt is almost as if everal "crisp" topologies\nare uperimpo ed on each other, and\nare evaluated imultaneously when the\nfuzzy topology is evaluated. Like the previous ver ion , the pre ent version is expected to enable the synthe is of a variety of digital and analog circuits with\nde ired functional re ponses.\nPrevious, di crete-topology ver ions of\nthe method were de cribed in "Reconfigurable Arrays ofTran istors for Evolvable\nHardware" (PO-20078) , I\\:A Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 25, o. 2 (February 2001),\npage 36; and "Evolutionary Automated\nSynthe is of Electronic Circui " ( P 20535), II\nTech Briefs, Vol. 26, o. 7\nQuly 2002), page 33. To recapitulate:\n"Evolution" is used here in a quasi-genetic en e, ignifying the onstruction\nand te ting of a sequence of population\nof circuits that fun tion as incrementall\nbetter olutions of a given de ign problem. The circuits are implemented either in oftware simulations or in hardware. Evolution in hardware involves the\nuse of electronically reconfigurable arra of tran i tors as analog switche for\nthe elective, repetitive connection and\ndi connection of tran i tor and other\ncircuit building blocks. The evolution i\nguided b a search-and-optimization algorithm (in particular, a genetic algorithm). At each tep of the evolutionary\nproces , the circuits are ranked according to how clo e their behaviors come to\nthe de ired behavior. A new population\nof circuits i generated from a selected\npool of b t circuits in the previou generation , ubject to uch genetic operators\nchromo om cro over and mutation .

The hardware implementation would involve the use of\n\nfield programmable transistor arrays\n(FPTAs) , which contain T-gate transistors\nas analog switches. These switches differ\nfrom the switches of the discrete-topology\nversion of the method in that instead of\nbeing limited to "on" or "off\' states, their\nresistances would be continuously variable\nbetween low values (tens to hundreds of\n\nReLiabLe \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nAnytime.

The superposition of circuit\ntopologies would be characterized as\n"fuzzy" becau e it would blur the borders among distinctive circuit topologies: the resulting circuits would belong,\nonly to certain degrees, to discrete\ntopologies, in each of which any two\ngiven components are either connected\nor not. In effect, a fuzzy topology would\ncontain many "seeding" topologies with\nsuperimposed effects. The role of evolution would be, in part, to isolate the\nmost promising one of the seeding\ntopologies present. In till other words,\nevaluation of a fuzzy topology would be\nomehow equivalent to imultaneous\nconcurrent evaluation of several superimposed circuit configurations.\nThe genetic algorithm would specify\nwhether each switch would be in a low-\n\nor high-resistance state, but in a proce\nsomewhat reminiscent of annealing, the\nnumerical meanings of "low" and "high"\nwould change gradually as a function of\na temperature-like parameter. Initially\nthe temperature-like parameter would\nbe high, causing the "low" and "high"\nswitch status to have values close to each\nother. Gradually (typically over ",,100 generations to ensure quasi-static response),\nthe temperature-like parameter would\nbe made to decrease, causing the switch\nresistances to become polarized to their\nextreme high ("off") and low ("on) values. This annealing-like proces would\ninduce modification of the circuit to be\nevolved. The evolutionary effect of this\nannealing-like process is what is meant by\n"morphing through fuzzy topologies."\nTests both in simulations and in hardware by computational imulation have\nled to the preliminary conclusion that in\ncomparison with a discrete-topology version of the method implemented with\nbinary switches , morphing through\nfuzzy topologie is about an order of\nmagnitude more efficient as a means of\n\nsearching for a desired circuit topology.\nPromi ing individuals (with higher fitness) have been found much earlier in\nthe search.\nIf the goal in a given situation is to obtain a discrete topology, then morphing\nthrough fuzzy topologies can accelerate\nevolution toward the goal. On the other\nhand, in orne cases, the degrees of\nopening of the witches could be regarded as extra degrees of freedom for\ndesign problems, thereby making possible increased numbers of olutions.\nThis work was done by Adrian Stoica\nand Carlos Salazar-Lazaro of Caltech for\nNASA\'s J e t Propulsion Laboratory.

Heretofore, the\nevolutionary automated ynthesis of electronic circuits has been accomplished by\nuse of either software simulations or hardware, but not both. Evolution in oftware\nhas been called "extrinsic," while evolution in hardware has been called "intrinsic." Because evolution by the pre ent\nmethod involves both intrinsic and extrin ic elements, it is called "mixtrinsic."\nPart of the trouble with oftware evolution is that when some evolved circuits\nare implemented in hardware, their behaviors differ greatly from tho e predicted in the simulations. Similarly, part\nof the trouble with hardware evolution is\nthat orne circuits evolved in hardware\nbehave differently when they are analyzed in computational imulations. The\ncause of these mi matches is the limited\naccuracy of the mathematical circuit\nmodel embodied in the software. To\nsome extent, the accuracy of the circuit\nmodel can be increased at the co t of\nincreased simulation time. However,\nsome information about circuits depends on fabrication proce s and cannol\n32\n\nbe included in the model. In addition,\nit can be desirable to evolve circuits that\nexhibit behaviors independent of the\ndetails of fabrication processes.\nAnother important and related i ue is\nthat of robustness and portability of sol utions. In each case, evolution finds the\n"easy way out," optimizing for whichever\nraw material (mathematical model or\nhardware components) i given. The inability to port a software olution to hardware renders the oftware solution useIe in a commercial or other practical\nsetting. On the other hand, the inability\nto analyze an evolved hardware olution\nin a software simulation reduces confi-\n\ndence in the hardware intrinsic solution\nbecaus the olution cannot be shown to\nwork outside tlle operating region used\nin the evaluations during evolution.\nThe limited range of applicability of a\nsolution is of pecial concern if the solution exploits very specific effects. Such a\nsolution could be characterized as a "point\ndesign." What is needed is a "domainwide" design that could constitute a solution within a large envelope of operating\nparameters. Examples of such parameters\ninclude temperature, poweHupply voltage, and measures of ionizing radiation.\nIn mixtrinsic evolution, one use populations of mixed individuals - some\n\nt\nMixed Population of Candidate\nHardware and Software Solutions\nSearch-and\xc2\xb7Optimization\n(Genetic) Algorithm\n\nIso~are I I\n\nHardware\n2\n\nI I\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSoftware or\nHardware n\n\nI\n\nI\nIn M ixtrinsic Evolution for the automated synthesis of electronic circuits, mixed populations of\nboth hardware and software are evaluated or each individual is evaluated both in hardware and\nin software.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nASA Tech Briefs, August 2002\n\nevaluated in software simulations and\nsome in real hardware (see figure). In a\nvariation of the technique, each individual is evaluated both in hardware and in\nsoftware and i as igned an averaged\nmeasure of goodness. Mixed populations\nconstrain the evolution to a solution that\nboth perform well in hardware and can\nbe well simulated in software. Such a solution exploits characteristic included\nin the software model for producing the\nde ired behavior but does not rely on the\n\nspecial characteristics of a specific hardware implementation. Solutions based\non hardware properties outside the software model are eliminated by evolution,\nbecau e during evolution, each solution\ncan be randomly assigned for evaluation\nin either hardware or software. As a result, solutions are robust; in addition,\nthey are likely to be patentable and in accordance with common de ign rules.\nThis work was done by Adrian Stoica of\nCaltech for NASA\'s J et Propulsion Labo-\n\nratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nSeveral improvements in the designs of\nflip-flop circuits that are parts of logic circuits have been proposed to reduce the\nincidence of logic errors associated with\ningle-event up ets (SEUs) [bit flips\ncaused by incident energetic ionizing particles] . Traditionally, radiation-hardened\nintegrated circuits have been manufactured on special proce lines, with emphasis, variously, on immunity to latchup\nand EUs for outer-space application or\non total-<iose hardne for military applications. The pre ent improvements are\nintended to confer latchup and EU immunity of a degree and type suitable for\nouter pace applications, but unlike in the\ntraditional approach, the improved designs could be implemented on ordinary\ncommercial compl mentary metal oxide\nemiconductor (CMO ) proce line.\nA complete de cription of the propo ed improvements and of the hi tori-\n\ncal background prereqUlSlte to understanding the improvements would\ngreatly exceed the space available for\nthis article; only a brief summary can be\ngiven here. Hi tori cally, guard ring\nhave been used to prevent latchups. In\ntheory, SEU can be eliminated via redundancy, but conventional redundancy involves at least 3 copies of all\nbasic logic circuitry plus additional logic\ncircuitry in the form of an infallible\nvoter circuit. One patented cherne calls\nfor dual redundant flip-flop circuits,\ncalled "Whitaker cell " after their inventor, in which what i known about the\npo ible directions of up ets in n- and pchannel device i utilized to enable the\ncell to recover from upsets. umerous\nother prior developments involve u ing\nextra delay \\vithin the flip-flop to reduce its usceptibility to glitche .

The minimum number\nof extra inverter stage de cribed in\nprior art i 2 pair, or 4 extra inverter.\nThere are also other non-Whitaker\nschemes involving dual flip-flops crosscoupled in some novel way to avoid or\nreduce up et.\nIn the dual flip-flop cherne, dual rail\nlogic may be used to drive the pair of flipflops. In the Whitaker cherne, single rail\nlogic may also be used, with the second\nflip-flop data provided through a delay\nequal to the worst-case glitch time for the\nlogic family, which eliminate the po ibility of a glitch arriving imultaneously on\nboth flip-flops. The worst-case time i approximately the propagation time for a\nfully loaded node on the slowe t gate. All\ngate must be de igned with balanced rise\nand fall time for this to work.

The two extra inverters together with the normal gating transistors provide three independent delay stages for absorbing glitches, the minimum theoretically required. Glitches are absorbed whether generated internally, or whether coming in on the Data or ciock (GB) lines, as long as the timing guidelines are followed .

Nor do these prior developments provide for asynchronous preset\nand clear operations.\nThe proposed improvements are summarized as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Optimized transistor sizing is used to\nmake th e shortest possible delay ele-\n\nments in a delay-based design, without resorting to passive components\nor more than one extra pair of inverters within the flip-flop. This requires fewer transi tors than prior\ndelay-based designs, and far fewer\nthan any of the dual flip-flop designs.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some of the delay is distributed into\nexisting transistors within the flip-flop\nin order to control the glitch times\nwhich can be generated within the flipflop, while absorbing external data or\nclock line glitches.\n\nthe accuracy of Rubidium ...\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The same delay-based technique\nwould be used to enable asynchronous preset and clear.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Only one guard ring with allowed\npolycrystalline-silicon crossings would\nbe used.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multistage balanced rise and fall times\ninside an ordinary flip-flop would be\nused to absorb glitches without changing state of the flip-flop.\nCircuits that incorporate the propo ed improvements could be simpler,\nmore compact, and more functional,\nrelative to prior SEU-immune circuits\nbased on dual flip-flops or more costly\ndelays. The delays involved, approximately one to two gate delay time in\noperation of the flip-flop, are comparable or less than the delays introduced\nin all prior forms of radiation-tolerant\nflip-flops (except the expensive and\ncomplicated case of dual flip-flops\nd riven by dual-rail logic).\nThis work was done by Robert Shuler,\nofJohnson Space Center .\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been jil\xc2\xa3d.

Examples of\nsuch electromagnets could include the actuators in magnetic bearings in advanced\ngas turbines.\nThe primary distinction between these\nwires and previously commercially available high-temperature wires lies in the\nelectrical insulation, which is intended to\nwith tand operating temperatures in the\nrange from 800 to 1,300 O (",,430 to ",,700\nF\n0c). The commercially available wires\nfeature tubular sheaths filled with insulating materials; while such insulation is\n\neffective, it is too bulky for electric-coil\napplications in which there are tringent\nlimitation on the sizes of the coils\nand/ or on the spacing between turns.\nThe present wires feature improved in ulation that is thinner, making it possible\nto fabricate coils that are smaller and\nmore closely wound.\nThe starting wire material for a coil of\nthis type can be either a nickel-clad, ceramic-insulated copper wire or a bare silver wire. The tarring wire is either primarily wrapped with S-glass as an\ninsulating material or else covered with another in ularing material wrapped in S-\n\niOh!!\nTough DSP Jobs are No Match for The Matador Series\nToro AID: 16 Non\xc2\xb7Muxed Channels . 16-bit- 2SQI(Hz\n(onejo AID: 4 Non\xc2\xb7Muxed Channels - 14-bit\xc2\xb7 lOMHz AID\nDelfin AID: 32 Non-Muxed Channels - 24-bit -192kHzA/D\nVista Video: 4Channels - NT$(, PAL Video I/O\n\nD : 16 Channels - l6-bit \xc2\xb7 250kHz\n/A\nD : 4 Channels - 16-bit - lOMHz\n/A\nD : 6 Channels- 24-bit -192kHz\n/A\nAudio: 2Channels - 16-bit -48kHz Audio 1/0\n\nFutures of the Matador Series of DSP Boards\nDigital Signal Processor\n~ 64-bitl32-bit, 3JV/SV, 33MHz PCI interface\n~ Ultra-flexible tngger modes with hardware event log built in logic\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SyncUnklClod<link interface for easy multi-board synchronization\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DSPIBIO devia-drivm for board ptriphfrals\nS\n~ (++ dIss IiIIraries 10 acaIem! code development\n~ Texas Instruments\' TMS32OC67ll\n\nglass prior to the winding proce . A ceramic binding agent is applied as a slurry\nduring the winding process to provide further insulating capability. The turn are\npre-bent during winding to prevent damage to the insulation.

ARSG is based on the\nAutomated Scheduling and Planning Environment (ASPE ) computer program,\nwhich has been described in several\nNASA Tech Briefs articles in recent years.\nGiven high-level scientific and engineering activitie required of a rover, ARSG\nautomatically generates a sequence of\ncommands that can be executed by the\nrover within resource constraints and in\ncompliance with flight rules. An automated-planning-and-scheduling oftware\nsubsystem encode rover design knowledge and uses search and reasoning techniques to automatically generate low-level\ncommand sequences while (1) re pecting\nrover operability constraints, scientific\nand engineering preference, environmental predictions, and (2) adhering to\nhard temporal constraints. By enabling\ngoal-driven command of planetary\nrovers, this software can reduce the need\nfor highly skilled rover engineering personnel, thereby reducing the co ts of mission operations. ARSG enables faster responses to changes in the state of a rover\n(e.g., malfunctions) or to scientific discoveries by eliminating the time-consuming manual validation of command equences and enabling rapid "what-if\'\nanalyses.\nContributors to this software include\nRobert Sherwood, Tara &tlin, Darren Mutz,\nGregg Rabideau, Steve Chien, Paul Backes,\nJeff Norris, Brian Cooper, and Scott Maxwell\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The program performs a unified analysis of the thermal, radiative,\npower-generation, and orbital-mechanics\naspects of operation because these aspects\nare interdependent The power-generating capacity of the solar panel of the satellite depends on both the impinging radiation and its temperature, which, in turn\ndepends on both its power output and the\nradiative environment. The radiative environment depends on the trajectory and\nattitude of the satellite relative to the positions of the Earth and Sun. Only by conidering all of the aforementioned phenomena together can one predict the\ntemperature and power generation of the\nsolar panel and the battery charges, currents, and voltages. Then the radiation\nforces are calculated from the re ults of\nthe foregoing unified thermal/ power/ radiative analysis.

The apparatus would\ninclude a track along which the spa ecraft would ride on a sled. Hundreds\nof small water jets energized by compressed-air pack would be located\nunder, and at small intervals along, the\ntrack. Each jet would be activated in\nturn a the sled pa sed by, aiming a\n\nhigh-speed\n(possibly\nuper onic)\nstream of water at baffles on the underside of the led. The force of water\nimpinging on the baffles would provide levitation and accelerate the sled\nalong the track. Unlike a previously\nproposed launch-assisting linear electric motor, the water-jet apparatus\nwould function without need for expensive electric-power-conditioning\nequipment. Unlike another launch-assist concept involving a piston driven\nalong a pneumatic tube, the present\n\nconcept does not present problem 9f\nhow to (1) couple the piston to the\nsled and (2) exert fine control over acceleration. Another advantage of the\nwaterjet concept is redundancy: even\nif several wat r jets were to malfunction, the remaining many functional\nwater jets hould uffice .\nThis work was done by Robert Youngquist\nand Frederick Adam.s of Kennedy Sp ace\nCenter.

Internal-Combustion Engines With Ringless Carbon Pistons\nEfficiencies would be higher and weights lower than those of conventional engines.\nLangley Research Center; Hampton, Virginia\nInternal-combustion engine would\nbe constructed with cylinder and ringle pi tons made of lightweight carbon/carbon composite material, according to a proposal . This proposal is a\nlogical extension of previous research\nthat howed that engines that contain\ncarboni carbon pistons with conventional metal piston rings running in conventional metal cylinders perform better\nthan do engines with conventional aluminum-alloy pi tons. The ob erved performance improvement (measured as\nincreased piston life during high-performance operation) can be attributed\nmainly to the low thermal expansion of\nthe carbon-carbon composite. Carboncarbon pistons can continue to operate\nunder thermal load that cause aluminum piston to seize or u tain scuffing damage due to excessive thermal\ngrowth and thermal di tortion.\nIn addition to having an extremely low\ncoefficient of thermal expan ion, carboncarbon is about 30 percent lighter than\naluminum which provides the benefit of\nreduced reciprocating mass (lower reciprocating mass can potentially reduce vibration forces and increase r/ min. capability) . Carbon-carbon composite al 0 has\nthe advantage over aluminum that it fully\nretain room-temperature strength and\nstiffness at high temperatures.

Although\ncold-clearance can be reduced omewhat by substituting a carbon-carbon piston, rings will still be needed to obtain\neffective sealing. An advantage i potentially achievable in a four-stroke engine\nbecause a tighter pi ton fit reduces the\no-called "crevice volume" or the gap between the pi ton and the cylinder wall\nabove the top ring. Fuel mixture which\nenters thi gap i not combu ted and is\nexhau ted as unburned hydrocarbon. If\nthe metal block were to be fitted with a\ncarbon-carbon leeve, the cold clearance\ncould be funh r reduced, but minimum\nclearance might be difficult to achieve\nbecau e the sleeve hape could be affected by thermally-induced distortion\nin the urrounding metal block (there\nare al 0 issues as to how the sleeve might\n\nbe contained in the block). If, on the\nother hand, the metal cylinder block\nand sleeve were to be replaced with a\ncylinder block made entirely of carboncarbon, the thermal expansion differential between the pi ton and cylinder materials would virtually be eliminated, as\nwould the potential for thermal di tortion of either component. The clearance could then be reduced to the absolute minimum. Operation without\nrings, which would eliminate a source of\npower-robbing friction, can now be considered an intriguing po sibility. Rings\nmay ultimately be required in the fourstroke application to minimize combu tion-gas blow-by and / or control oil consumption; however, the crevice volume,\nwhich is a major cau e of hydrocarbon\nemissions, would be eliminated over the\nengine\' entire operating temperature\nrange and ring performance could potentially be improved becau e ofle s pi ton rocking in the bore. Ringles operation would appear to be particularly\nattractive for high-r/ min two- u\xc2\xb7oke engines where oil-wiper rings are not required and relatively more blow-by may\nbe tolerable.\nFor implicity, the figure illu trate a\none-cylinder, air-cooled, two-stroke internal-combu tion engine that might\n\nbe built according to this concept (multicylinder and four-stroke engine are\nalso possible). The cylinder barrel\nwould be made of carbon-carbon compo ite sandwiched between an aircooled metal head and a meta l\ncrankcase. This as embly would be he ld\ntogether by long head bolts, which\nwould pa s through the head and\nthrough (or along ide) the carboni carbon cylinder barrel into threaded holes\nin the crankca e. The carbon/ carbon\ncylinder barrel could be sealed to the\ncrankcase with an O-ring and to the\nhead with a head ga ket.\nThe cylinder block could be fabricated with one or more of many possible configurations of fibers in the carbon / carbon material. The simplest\nand most economical configuration\nwould be a stack of plies in which all\nfibers are aligned perpendicular to the\naxis of the cylinder bore. The inherently low interlaminar trength of the\ncarboni carbon block would not be a\nmajor concern because the clamping\nforce applied by the head bolts would\nnegate cros -ply tensile stresses in the\nlaminate.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nLow-plasticity burni hing (LPB) ha\nbeen developed as an affordable means\nof imparting re idual compre sive\ntres es to urface layers of metal parts\n(especia \\1y engine components) in\norder to increa e their fatigue live.\nHeretofore ,\nurface\ncompressive\nstresses to enh ance the fatigue lives\nhave been produced, variou Iy, by shot\npeening or laser shock peening. nfortunately, thermal relaxation has been\nfound to re ult in 1 s of the needed\n0\nsurface-layer com pre sive stre se , with\nconsequent hortening of component\nlives and reduction of engine performances. Hence, what is needed is a\nmeans of imparting thermally table\nurface com pre ion.\nIn the LPB proce s, a smooth, fre rolling spherical ball i pressed against\nand ro lled along the surface of the\nworkpiece to be burni hed. The ball\nmust be hard, and it must h ave a high\nmodulu of ela ticity and a high yield\ntrength. To en ure free rolli ng, the\nbaH is supported in a spherical- ocket\nfluid bearing (ee figure) with ufficient fluid pres ure and flow to maintain the ball out of contact with the\nocket. The force with which the ball is\npressed against the urface is made\nlarge enough to deform a surface layer\nof material into a stale of compre ion ,\ntaking account of any tensile u\'ess that\nmight exist in the workpiece prior to\nburnishing.\nBy use of the po itioning capability\nof a computer numerically controll ed\n(C C) machine tool, the ball i moved\nalong the surface in a ra ter or other\nsuitable pattern to cover the urface in\na erie of passes at a controlled separation cho en to obtain maximum\ncompre sion with minimum cold working. LPB is not limited to Oat workpieces: In the case of a complexly\nshaped workpiece, the positioning capability of a multiaxis C C machine\ntool can be exploited to move the ball\non any desired path acros the surface,\na in a typical multiaxi C C machining operation.\nLPB produce minimal cold work,\nimparting greater (in comparison with\n\n50\n\nshot peening and laser shock peening\nwhen performed with multiple shocking cycles) resistance to thermal relaxation at high temperature . The resulting greater retention of surface\ncom pre ion at engine operating temperature re lilts in sub tantial increa es in fatigue lives and in retardance of the growth of pre-exi ting\ncrack. In addition, LPB increases resistance to damage by impacts of foreign\nobjects.\nLPB costs les than does laser shock\npeening and offers greater depth and\nstability of the compressive layer, relative to shot peening. Because LPB can\nbe performed easily during manufacturing by use of conventional C C machine tools, there is no need to ship\ncomponents to eparate facilitie for\nLPB. The proces can be readily accommodated in an existing machine hop\n\nenvironment. Both the capital co t of\nLPB equipment and the unit co t of\ncomponent processing typically are an\norder magnitude les than for la er\nh o k peening.\nThis work was done by Paul S.

A method for accurately measuring structural static strain in hars h environments is an important requirement\nfor future flight re earch of hypersonic\nvehicles and ground test articles. Sturdy,\nflight-worthy train sen ors mu t be developed for attachmen t to uperalloy,\nnew compo ite material, and tllermalprotection y terns. With little deviation\nfrom standard Rokide flame-spray\ninstallatio n procedures, pre liminary\ntests indicate viable data can be produced to operating temperatures of at\nleast 1,700 O (927 \xc2\xb0C).\nF\nIn the pre ent meth od, the temperature-compensation element is encapsulated and insulated in alumina by the\nRokide fl ame-spray process and used as\nan inactive element in a half-bridge\nconfiguration. An inactive element, or\ngauge, is often also referred to as a\n"dummy gauge" because it does not\n\n52\n\nsen e surface trains; in other\nwords, there i no mechanical strain\ntransfer from the substrate to the\ngauge filament. The temperaturecompen ation element i mounted\nin close proximity to the attached,\nor active, train gauge. Adequate\nsurface contact of the compensation\nelement to the test article must be\nachiev d in order to maintain good\nthermal conductivity. H owever, unlike the active strain gauge, the temperature-compen ation element is\nnot rigidly attached to the substrate\nwhich is to be measured; instead,\nthe temperature-compensation element ( ee Figure 1) is attached flexibly to the substrate using\nnickel/aluminum-alloy strap.\nConfigured as a half-bridge, the\ntemperature-compen ation element\nis connected in an arm of a Wheattone btidge adjacent to an arm containing tile active train gauge.

These keys are u ed LO\nprotect the privacy of communications\nvia the Internet.

The performance of a s stem\nthat uses implicit revocation is limited\nby the co t of acquiring certificates:\nsupplying real-time information on revocation tatus during each acqui ition\ni computationallyexpen ive.\nWindowed revocation involve a hybrid of explicit and implicit revocation\nthat affords the de ired calability. In\n,vindowed revocation, the i uer\nerts\nrevocation in two different ways at two\ndifferent time: (1) implicitly during initial acquisition of a certificate, and thereafter (2) explicitly through periodically\npubli h d RLs.

By bounding the time during\nwhich each revoked certificate mu t be\nincluded in the periodic CRLs, revocation windows limit the sizes of CRLs and\ntlm the costs of distributing them.\nWindowed revocation is s cure, and its\ncorrectne has been rigorously mathematically proved.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA magneto trictive motor and its drive\ncircuit and control system have been deigned to be e pecially suitable for robotic\napplications in which there are requirements for preci e, high-force linear actuators. The motor includes a laminated armature made of the magneto trictive\nalloy TbO.27DyO. 73F 0.2. The amlature is\n\nsandwiched between two double-layered,\nthree-phase stators, which are energized\nto make the armature move lin early in\n"inchwoml" fashion .

This or almost any other magneto trictive motor presents a highly inductive load to its drive circuit and therefore\noperates at a low power factor in the absence of correction. As in other elecu;cal\napplication , a low power factor is undesirable because it give ri e to the need\nfor a greater drive potential or drive current t.han would otherwise be needed to\ndeliver a given amount of power. At its\nresonance frequency of 470 H z, the\nmotor windings exhibit a power factor of\n0.352, but the eries combination of the\ncapacitor and the motor windings exhibits a power factor of 0.989 - clo e to\nthe ideal value of 1.\nBecause the speed of the inchwotm\nmotion depends on both the amplitude\nand frequency of the drive current, the\ncontrol system include one controller\nthat holds the frequency constant and\nvat;e the amplitude and anothel- controller that hold the amplitude constant\nand varies the frequency. Both controllers utilize proportional + integral\ncompensation and implement an illtegrator-antiwindup cheme to limit accumulation of po ition-error signals.\nThe control y tem include a po ition\nensor and a 12-bit analog-to-d igital\n( / D) converter that proces e the ensor output. Becau e the output swing of\nthe position sensor is only one quarter of\nthe input range of the\nD converter,\none could utilize only 10 of the 12 bits\n(con-e ponding to a po ition resolution\nof 49 pm ) if o ne were to feed the raw senor output to the converter. Therefore,\nto make use of fu ll 12-bit 1- solution of\nthe / D converter, the en or output i\nfed to the converter via an amplifier\nstage gain of 4. Another amplifier stage\nwith a gain of 39 is also includ d to\ndemonstrate a capability of preci e po itioning; a po ition re olution of ",l.25\npm is achievable when this amplifier is\nincluded in the signal path.\nThis work was done by James H.
