Volcanic and tectonic landforms observed from imaging experiments show that Mars must have been a seismically active planet in the past and there is no reason to discount the notion that Mars is seismically active today but at a lower level of activity. Models are explored for present day Mars seismicity. Depending on the sensitivity and geometry of a seismic network and the attenuation and scattering properties of the interior, it appears that a reasonable number of Martian seismic events would be detected over the period of a decade. The thermoelastic cooling mechanism as estimated is surely a lower bound, and a more refined estimate would take into account specifically the regional cooling of Tharsis and lead to a higher frequency of seismic events.", "title": "Martian seismicity", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920001515, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Phillips, Roger J."}, "organization": {"name": "Southern Methodist Univ.", "location": "Dallas, TX, United States"}}, "id": "54eed56399e44133a7e89dd66d1f797b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920001515, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grimm, Robert E."}, "organization": {"name": "Southern Methodist Univ.", "location": "Dallas, TX, United States"}}, "id": "a9a4f7b7fa5447e1b7788bea169c6118"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920001515, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920001515, "id": "fa50a93a034b45a4a0acd035656bffb5", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Reports of Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program, 1990", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920001515.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920001515/downloads/19920001515.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920001515/downloads/19920001515.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920001515/downloads/19920001515.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
