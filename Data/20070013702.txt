Commonly\nadopted mitigation measures, such as limiting postmission orbital lifetimes of satellites to less than 25\nyears, will slow down the population growth, but will be insufficient to stabilize the environment.\nTherefore, to better limit the growth of future debris population to protect the environment, the\nremediation option, i.e., removing existing large and massive objects from orbit, needs to be considered.\nThis paper does not intend to address the technical or economical issues for active debris removal.\nRather, the objective is to provide a sensitivity study to quantify the effectiveness of various remediation\noptions. A removal criterion based upon mass and collision probability is developed to rank objects at the\nbeginning of each projection year. This study includes simulations with removal rates ranging from 5 to\n20 objects per year, starting in the year 2020. The outcome of each simulation is analyzed and compared\nwith others. The summary of the study serves as a general guideline for future debris removal\nconsideration.\nINTRODUCTION\ngrowth3-5. However, this mitigation measure will\nbe insufficient to prevent further growth of the\nEarth satellite population. To better preserve the\nnear-Earth environment for future space\nactivities, other alternatives must be considered.\n\nRecent numerical simulations on the evolution of\norbital debris populations in low-Earth orbit\n(LEO, 200 to 2000 km altitude) indicate that the\npopulation has reached a point where the\nenvironment is unstable and population growth is\ninevitable1-2. The main conclusion from the two\nstudies is that even if no further space launches\nwere conducted, the Earth satellite population\nwould remain relatively constant for only the\nnext 50 years or so. Beyond that, the debris\npopulation would begin to increase noticeably\ndue to the production of collisional debris. In\nreality, the satellite population growth in LEO\nwill undoubtedly be worse than the studies\nindicate, since spacecraft and their orbital stages\nwill continue to be launched into space and\nunexpected major breakups may continue to\noccur. Postmission disposal of vehicles, such as\nlimiting postmission orbital lifetimes to less than\n25 years, can certainly slow down the population\n\nConcepts for removing large debris from LEO\nhave been proposed for more than 25 years.\nEarly ideas for using the U.S. Space Shuttle,\neither directly or in conjunction with an orbital\ntransfer vehicle, were found unattractive due to\nsafety, availability, cost, and policy issues.\nNumerous independent robotic concepts, ranging\nfrom classical space-based garbage scows to\nmomentum and electrodynamic tethers, drag\naugmentation devices, solar and magnetic sails,\nand other exotic techniques, have also been\nconsidered. However, reviews by panels of\ninternational experts have repeatedly failed to\nidentify a single plan which is both technically\n\n1\n\nThe long-term F10.7 projection8 was a repeat of\na sixth-order sine and cosine functional fit to\nSolar Cycles 18 to 23. A simple smoothing\nfunction was used to interpolate the two solar\nflux components during the short- to long-term\ntransition. Explosion probabilities of rocket\nbodies and spacecraft were based on an analysis\nof historical explosions between 1988 and 1998.\nObjects with non-zero explosion probabilities\nwere classified, by origin and type, into nine\ncategories. Each category was assigned a timedependent explosion probability for up to 10\nyears (since launch). Only objects 10 cm and\nlarger were included in collision consideration.\nThis is also the same size threshold for objects to\nbe discussed in the following analysis. After\neach breakup, fragments were generated with the\nNASA Standard Breakup Model, which\ndescribed the size, area-to-mass ratio, and\nvelocity distributions of the debris9.\n\nfeasible in the near-term and economically\nviable.\nNonetheless, in late 2006 the International\nAcademy of Astronautics (IAA) initiated a new\nstudy to determine if a nexus of technology, cost,\nand policy might lead to an achievable means of\nremediating the near-Earth space environment in\nthe foreseeable future. Although the IAA study\nwill not be completed until late 2008 or 2009, the\npurpose of the present paper is to describe the\npotential effectiveness of debris removal\noperations under various scenarios.\nThese\nresults, in turn, could influence the development\nof efficient debris removal techniques.\nThis paper summarizes a sensitivity study on the\neffectiveness of active debris removal (ADR). A\nnon-mitigation scenario where the historical\nLEO population was simulated, then projected\n200 years into the future, was adopted as the\nbenchmark scenario. A simple selection criterion\nbased on collision probability and mass of each\n10 cm and larger object was developed.\nNumerical simulations of three ADR scenarios\nwith different removal rates were carried out and\ncompared with the benchmark population. The\nresults demonstrated that with a reasonable\nselection criterion active debris removal could be\na very effective way to limit the growth of future\ndebris populations.\n\nA key component of LEGEND is its collision\nprobability estimation module.\nCollision\nprobabilities among orbiting objects are\nestimated with a fast pair-wise comparison\nalgorithm, Cube7,10. Since objects are evaluated\nindividually, it becomes possible to develop\nselection criteria for ADR studies. For any\nobject i that has a finite collision probability with\na second object j, within the same cube at time t,\nits collision probability can be expressed as:\n\ndPi (t ) = s i s j Vimp \xcf\x83 dU dt ,\n\nMODEL DESCRIPTION\nThe tool used in the study is the NASA orbital\ndebris evolutionary model LEGEND (a LEO-toGEO Environment Debris model). It is a high\nfidelity, three-dimensional, physical model.\nLEGEND is capable of simulating the historical\nand future debris environment from LEO to the\ngeosynchronous orbit (GEO) regions (Liou et al.\n2004; Liou 2007). The focus of the present study\nis the LEO environment. Each test scenario\npresented included 100 Monte Carlo simulations\nwith a projection period of 200 years. Future\nlaunch traffic was simulated by repeating the\n1999-to-2006 launch cycle. The solar flux F10.7\nvalues used in the projection period had two\ncomponents: a short-term projection (2006-2007,\nobtained from NOAA Space Environment\nCenter) and a long-term projection (2008-2206).\n\n[1]\n\nwhere si and sj are the spatial densities of objects\ni and j in the cube, respectively, Vimp is the\nrelative velocity between the two objects, \xcf\x83 is the\ncombined collision cross-sectional area, dU is the\nvolume of the cube, and dt is the time interval.\nThe default parameters used in LEGEND include\na time step of 5 days, and 10 km \xc3\x97 10 km \xc3\x97 10\nkm cubes.\nThe first step in an ADR study is to develop a set\nof selection criteria so that objects selected for\nremoval will have the most effect in reducing the\nlong-term growth of the LEO debris population.\nObjects with perigee altitudes above 2000 km, or\nwith eccentricities greater than 0.5, were not\nconsidered for removal in this study. Payloads\n\n2\n\n2206 (future projection). Each curve represented\nthe average of 100 Monte Carlo runs.\n\nlaunched after 2006 were assumed to have 8-year\nmission lifetimes, and were not considered for\nremoval until after the end of the mission. For\nany object i which was eligible for removal\nconsideration, a simple criterion, Ri, was\nadopted:\n\nRi (t ) = Pi (t ) \xc3\x97 mi ,\n\nFigure 1 shows the effective numbers of objects,\n10 cm and larger, in LEO from the four\nscenarios. The effective number is defined as the\nfractional time, per orbital period, an object\nspends between 200 and 2000 km altitude. Each\ncurve represented the average of 100 Monte\nCarlo runs. The business-as-usual scenario\npredicted a fast non-linear growth of the future\nLEO debris population in the next 200 years.\nThe three ADR scenarios, on the other hand,\npredicted a much slower increase in the\nenvironment. A simple parameter, Effective\nReduction Factor (ERF), can be calculated to\nquantify the effectiveness of each ADR scenario\nusing the non-mitigation scenario as a\nbenchmark. ERF is defined as:\n\n[2]\n\nwhere Pi(t) was defined by Equation (1), and mi\nwas the object\xe2\x80\x99s mass. Debris removal was\nimplemented at the beginning of each projection\nyear after the year 2020. Once the Ri values for\nobjects with non-zero collision probability were\ncalculated, they were sorted in descending order.\nA pre-defined number of objects with the highest\nRis were removed from the simulated\nenvironment immediately.\nACTIVE DEBRIS REMOVAL\nCASE STUDY\n\nERF = [total no. of objects reduced in 2206] /\n[no. of objects removed via ADR through 2206].\n\nFour test scenarios were selected for this case\nstudy. The first one was a non-mitigation\n(\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness-as-usual\xe2\x80\x9d) scenario. The other three\nscenarios assumed ADR was implemented in the\nyear 2020, with annual debris removal rates of 5,\n10, and 20 objects, respectively (these three\nscenarios were referred to as 2020/5, 2020/10,\nand 2020/20 throughout the rest of the paper).\nEach scenario was carried out with a 200-year\nprojection period and 100 MC runs.\n\nThe ERF for the ADR 2020/5 scenario is 36. It\nmeans for every object that is removed (via\nADR) from the environment, a total of 36 objects\nwill be reduced by the end of 2206. Table 1\nsummarizes the ERFs of the three ADR\nscenarios. The overall result indicates that\nEquation (1) is indeed a good objective selection\ncriterion to identify objects which have the\ngreatest potential of contributing to the growth of\nthe future debris population. The trend also\nshows that, as expected, not all objects contribute\nequally to future collision-fragmentation\nactivities. Once the worst potential contributors\nare removed, the effectiveness of ADR will be\nreduced.\n\nEffective Number of Objects (>10 cm, LEO)\n\n70000\nNon-mitigation\n60000\n\nADR (2020/5)\nADR (2020/10)\n\n50000\n\nADR (2020/20)\n\n40000\n\n30000\n\n20000\n\n10000\n\n0\n1950\n\n1970\n\n1990\n\n2010\n\n2030\n\n2050\n\n2070\n\n2090\n\n2110\n\n2130\n\n2150\n\n2170\n\n2190\n\n2210\n\nYear\n\nFigure 1: LEGEND-simulated LEO debris populations (objects 10 cm and larger) between 1957\nand 2006 (historical), and between 2007 and\n\n3\n\nADR 2020/5\n\nADR 2020/10\n\nADR 2020/20\n\nNUMBER OF OBJECTS REMOVED VIA ADR\nTHROUGH\n2206 (A)\n\n935\n\n1870\n\n3740\n\nREDUCTION IN LEO OBJECTS IN 2206 (B)\n\n33,337\n\n40,907\n\n44,712\n\nERF BY 2206 = (B) / (A)\n\n36\n\n22\n\n12\n\nTable 1.: The ERFs of the three active debris removal scenarios.

They are summarized in Table 2.\nThe last row of the table is the ratio of objects\nremoved, via ADR, to the reduction in\ncumulative collision probability by 2206. In the\n2020/5 scenario, for every 9.5 objects removed\nvia ADR, one collision is reduced by 2206. This\nnumber increases with an increasing removal\nrate. Again, the trend is a reflection of how ADR\nis implemented in the study \xe2\x80\x93 the worst potential\noffenders are removed first from the\nenvironment.\n\n2.5E-07\n\n2206 (Non-mitigation)\n2206 (ADR 2020/05)\n\nSpatial Density (no/km3)\n\n2.0E-07\n\n2206 (ADR 2020/10)\n2206 (ADR 2020/20)\n2006\n\n1.5E-07\n\n1.0E-07\n\n5.0E-08\n\n0.0E+00\n200\n\n180\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900 1000 1100 1200 1300 1400 1500 1600 1700 1800 1900 2000\n\nAltitude (km)\n\n160\n\nNon-mitigation\n\nFigure 3.

The top\nfour cures are the masses in LEO as functions of\ntime from the four test cases. The total mass in\nLEO is calculated based on the mass of each\nLEO-crossing object weighted by the fraction of\ntime the object resides in LEO. Although the\nbreakup of a massive object adds a significant\namount of debris to the environment, and\nincreases the impact risks to other orbiting\nsatellites, it does not lead to any increase in mass\nin LEO. For the non-mitigation scenario, there is\na constant increase in mass as a result of the\nimbalance between objects being launched and\nobjects naturally decaying. When ADR is\nimplemented, significant amounts of mass are\nremoved (the bottom three curves), and total\nmass in LEO is kept more or less constant\nthrough 2206. The mass factor will need to be\ncarefully evaluated when a cost/benefit analysis\n\nADR 2020/10\n\nNumber\n\n400\n\nADR 2020/5\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nAltitude (km)\n\nFigure 5.

Bottom three curves:\ncumulative masses of objects removed from the\nthree ADR scenarios.\n\nOne possible modification to improve Equation\n(1) is to include the longevity factor. When two\nobjects have similar \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d values, it is obvious that\nremoving the object which has a longer orbital\nlifetime would have a more positive impact on\nthe environment. The difficulty here is how to\nproperly incorporate the lifetime dependence into\nthe equation. Since orbital lifetime does not\nincrease linearly with increasing altitude, a linear\ndependence of orbital lifetime to \xe2\x80\x9cR\xe2\x80\x9d may result\nin the removal of all objects at higher altitudes,\ne.g., 1500 km, before any objects at lower\naltitudes are considered. The present study\naddressed the near-term (i.e., next 200 years or\nso) environment concerns. ADR scenarios based\non the selection criterion of Equation (1)\neffectively reduce the population in regions\nwhich have the greatest potential of growth in\n200 years (see Figure 3). If the objective is to\naddress the population growth over a much loner\nperiod of time11, e.g., thousands of years, the\ndirect implementation of orbital lifetime into the\nselection criterion may be further justified.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe test cases described in the previous section\nrepresented the first step to evaluate the\neffectiveness of ADR. The scenarios were\ndesigned to demonstrate and quantify, in a\nrelative way, how ADR could reduce the growth\nof the future debris population in LEO. The\nassumptions made in the simulations were\nreasonable, but certainly not perfect. The nonmitigation scenario was selected as a benchmark\nfor comparison. Since mitigation measures (such\nas limiting postmission orbital lifetimes of\nsatellites to less than 25 years) have been\nimplemented, although not 100% by major space\nagencies, the assumption of \xe2\x80\x9cnon-mitigation\xe2\x80\x9d\nmight be too conservative. Other scenarios,\nincluding the \xe2\x80\x9cno new launches\xe2\x80\x9d2 and\n\xe2\x80\x9cpostmission disposal\xe2\x80\x9d5, can also be considered\nfor benchmarks to test the effectiveness of\nvarious ADR strategies.\nQuantitatively the\nresults would be different. It is expected that\nfewer objects would be required to be removed\nper year to achieve the same reduction factor.\nQualitatively, however, ADR scenarios would\nstill be an effective way to control the population\ngrowth. Another assumption in the ADR\nsimulations was that once an object was selected,\nit was removed from the environment\n\nThe year selected to implement active debris\nremoval in the three ADR scenarios was 2020. It\nwas assumed that by then the technical and cost\nchallenges would be addressed to make ADR a\nreality. Moving the starting time somewhat\n\n6\n\n7.

However, if\nADR is not implemented before the population\nreaches a much faster or even exponential growth\nrate, the cost-to-benefit ratio of ADR would be\nsignificantly increased.\n\n8.

Additional issues,\nsuch as ownership, liability, and policy need to\nbe addressed as well. However, if the mitigation\nmeasures currently adopted by international\nspace agencies and industry are insufficient to\nlimit the growth of the future debris population,\nactive debris removal must be seriously\nconsidered as an option to preserve the nearEarth space for future generations.\n\n9.
