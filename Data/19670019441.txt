X R\nUIO:\n\n.\n\nL Weidenbaum\n.\n\n.\nMurray L Weidenbaum is Chairman of the Department of\nEconomics and Director of the NASA Economic Research\nProgram at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri.\nHe has previously served as the Corporate Economist\nfor the Being Company and Executive Secretary of the\nPresident\'s Committee on the Economic Impact of Defense\nand Disarmament.\nMr. Weidenbaum has authored various studies on defense\nand space marketing, including The Military Market in\nthe United States, published by the American Marketing\nAssociation in 1963. He received his Ph. D from\n.\nPrinceton University. This research was supported by\nNASA Grant NsG-342 to Washington University.\n\nSTRATEGIES FOR DIVERSIFICATION\n\nOF DEFENSE/SPACE COMPANIES\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to offer specific guidelines for defense/space\ncontractors that wish to utilize their specialized capabilities to diversify\ninto other markets, From the viewpoint of the country as a whole, such diversification seems highly desirable. It would represent a major method of accomplishing the transfer of space and defense technology to the commercial and non1\ndefense economy, which is so highly desired as a matter of national policy.\nFrom the viewpoint of the individual company, such diversification also could\nbe extremely beneficial. It would broaden the customer base, thus reducing\ndependence on two fairly closely related government markets\nA l s o , it would introduce a different set of uncertainties\n\n-- defense and space.\n\n-- the private sector\n\nbusiness cycle in addition to the public sector budget cycle. Although not\nnecessarily, the fluctuations in these two market areas might at times offset\neach other. Finally, by using the by-products of the basic defensetspace product\nlines, the companies may be getting an added return on an investment which already\nhas beeii\n\nm t e aid writteo o f f ,\nai\n\nOf course, those familiar with the actual diversification experiences of\nthe leading defense and space companies know, on the basis of very sad experience,\nthe gap between the ideal and the reality. Analyses to date conclude that the\n\n-\n\nmajor successes in market diversification on the part of the large defense/space\ncontractors have been within the aerospace market itself\n\n-- that is, horizontal\n\na\n\nnot lateral diversification. However, some of the most dismal business failures\nalso occurred in this same area\n\n-- the 202 and 404 piston transports, the Electra\n\n8\nturboprop, and the 8 0 and 990 jets, among others.\n\n%or an example of accomplishments and future lines of endeavor, see Richard\nL Lesher and George J. Bowick, Assessing Technology Transfer, Washington, D C.,\n.\n.\nU S Government Printing Office, 1967, 121 pp.\n. .\n\n2\n\nAlmost all of the smaller diversification efforts fall within one of the\nfollowing categories: ( ) they have been abandoned, ( 2 ) they have been cut\n1\nback and are providing rather marginal returns, (3) they are so recent that\nthe returns are not yet in, and\n-\n\n(4) perhaps the most popular condition, manage-\n\nment has not yet faced the decision to go beyond the initial study and exploratory\ndevelopment stage.*\n\nDeapite all of this, efforts to utilize defense and space\n\ncapabilities in other markets still continue.\nA key assumption underlying this study is that such efforts at market\n\ndiversification will continue to be made.\n\nHence, it should be useful to see\n\nwhat objective assistance can be given to such attempts. The positive approach\npresented here consists of a blend of two elements, ( ) the lessons from\n1\ndefense/space marketing and diversification experiences of the past, coupled with\n(2) the concepts and methodology of modern business planning.\n\nThis analysis is built upon a simplified five-step model of the business\n()\nplanning pro~ess:~ 1 external orientation, setting forth\nforecasting\n\n-- assuming or\n\n-- the external environment in which t h e business e n t e q r i s e v i U\n\nbe operating during the planning period, (2) targeting, establishing long-term\ngoals and objectives for the enterprise, ( 3 )\n\ninternal orientation, analyzing\n\nthe capability of and resources available to the enterprise, (4) development,\n\n-\n\nchoosing the key programs and major undertakings on which the company will embark,\nand (5) evaluation, closing the loop by checking the adequacy of the development\nprograms to meet the goals and objectives in the anticipated environment.\n\n.\n2Murray L Weidenbaum, "Adjusting to a Defense Cutback: Government Policy\nToward Business", Quarterly Review of Economics and Business, V o l . 4, No. 1,\nSpring 1 6 , pp. 7-14,\n94\n3\n\nThis model is based upon M L Weidenbaum, The Role of Economics in Long\n. .\nRange Planning f o r an Aerospace Company, Washington University, Department of\nEconomics, January 1967, 33pp.\n\n3\nEach of these f i v e steps w i l l be taken up i n turn t o see how they a r e\nnecessary f o r formulating d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n s t r a t e g i e s .\nEXTERNAL ORIENTATION\n\nThe analysis of the external environment i s the area i n which most analysts\nhave erred i n the past\n\n-- e i t h e r planning\n\nf o r catastrophe ( o r disarmament) o r\n\nf o r Valhalla, where the military budget r i s e s each year a t an accelerating rate.\nThe most sensible course of action may be t o assume, with Adam Smith, t h a t t h e\ncost of defense "grows gradually more and more expensive, as the society advances\nin civili~ation".~\nSpecifically, it may be assumed t h a t the basic Communist\nobjective of world domination w i l l continue.\n\nAlthough the nature of the t h r e a t\n\nmay change, and the American response t o it, the underlying demand f o r security\nsystems t o counter t h a t t h r e a t w i l l p e r s i s t .\nMore specifically, it may be useful t o r e l y on a statement by a distinguished\nmember of the s t a f f of the U S. Bureau of the Budget:\n.\n\n...\n\n"Outlays f o r defense and international purposes\nhave been\nstimulated by a number of unforeseen shocks and have exhibited an\ne r r a t i c s t e p l i k e upward growth i n the post-World War I1 period i n\nThis s t e p l i k e movement may well\nresponse t o Soviet challenges\nbe t h e p a t t e r n over the long-run future, as long as the cold war\nremains with us, but there need not be upward steps every year.115\n\n...\n\nWith regard t o the space program, the present i s t r u l y a \' p e r i o d of decision.\nAlready t h e resources devoted t o Apollo a r e beginning t o diminish, even though\n\n.\n\nthe expected lunar landing i s several years away.\n\nTotal employment on Apollo,\n\nincluding both NASA and company personnel, i s estimated t o decline from a peak of\n300,000 i n 1966 t o 240,000 i n 1968, a drop of 20 percent.\n\n6\n\nThe major uncertainty\n\n4Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Nw York, The Modern Library, 1937, p. 668.\ne\n5 S a u e l M.

Apollo" , International Science and Technology, March\n1967, P. 32.\n\n4\n\nhere, from a business planning viewpoint, i s the nature of post-Apollo applications\n\n.\n\nAnalysts of the NASA program generally concur t h a t any major space e f f o r t\nf o r t h e next 25 years w i l l probably be based upon one or more of the following\nf i v e objectives : (1) continuation of the unmanned s c i e n t i f i c exploration of\nspace, including near e a r t h space, t h e near planets, the sun, the outer planets,\nand t h e space between,\n\n(2) continuation of programs f o r s a t e l l i t e s t h a t have\n\np r a c t i c a l benefits, such a s communication and meteorology,\nresearch and engineering laboratories,\n\n( 3 ) manned o r b i t i n g\n\n(4) continued exploration of the moon,\n\nfollowing the i n i t i a l Apollo landing, and\n\n( 5 ) a manned exploration of one of\n\nthe near planets, probably Mars. 7\n\nIt is generally agreed t h a t these are the a l t e r n a t i v e d i r e c t i o n s the space\n\nprogram can go.\n\nWhat i s not generally agreed are the p r i o r i t i e s t h a t should\n\nbe given each of these objectives, p a r t i c u l a r l y i n competition with other non-\n\ndefense programs, such a s anti-poverty, urban transportation, environmental\ncontrol, education, and oceanographic research and development.\n\nThis is an\n\nuncertainty which cannot r e a d i l y be resolved by any amount of objective analysis.\nSumming t h i s combination of assumptions and uncertainties y i e l d s the following\nresults :\n1 The most prudent course of action f o r a company o r division of a large\n.\n\nconglomerate corporation which now i s primarily oriented t o the military, space,\nand r e l a t e d government markets i s t o count on t h e continued existence of a l a r g e\naggregate volume of business i n t h i s f i e l d f o r the foreseeable future.\n2\n.\n\nI n conjunction w i t h t h i s belief i n the r e l a t i v e permanency of t h i s\n\ngovernmental market f o r high-technology products and services, there should be\nthe deep understanding of the inherent v o l a t i l i t y , the abrupt s h i f t s , the peak\n\nand v a l l e y nature of t h i s market and, even more p a r t i c u l a r l y , of the analyses\nwhich a r e made of the short-term outlook of t h i s market area.\n\n3.\n\nAlong with i t s v o l a t i l i t y , there i s the secular expansion i n the range\n\nof products being purchased i n t h i s government market.\n\nAside from the arsenals\n\nwhich themselves a r e i n the public sector, u n t i l recently it has been primarily\nthe a i r c r a f t industry which was the branch of the private sector devoting the\nbulb of i t s e f f o r t s t o the government market.\n\nWith the r i s e of missile, space,\n\nand r e l a t e d requirements, the governmental product mix was broadened t o cover\nelectronics, propulsion, and instrument companies o r divisions, as well as small\n\nR and D companies themselves.\n\nHence, p l o t t i n g the number of companies and\n\ni n d u s t r i e s which a r e primarily oriented t o t h e government market a s a function\nof time results i n a positively sloping trend l i n e .\n\nThus, t h e t h i r d basic finding\n\nf o r defense/space companies i s the belief t h a t t h e i r market w i l l continue t o\nwiden, t h e SST and oceanographic e f f o r t s being the most recent cases i n point.\nSome s t a t i s t i c a l perspective may be obtained by examining the market and\nproduct s h i f t s experienced by the members of the Aerospace Industries Association.\nThis group of companies may be taken as a f a i r l y good proxy f o r the defense/space\nindustry, a s the membership includes the suppliers of major a i r c r a f t , missile,\nand space systems, a s well a s leading producers of propulsion, electronics, and\ninstrumentation subsystems.\nA s seen i n Table 1, commercial sales of the aerospace industry have r i s e n\n\nfrom $3.8 b i l l i o n i n 1960 t o an estimated $6.7 b i l l i o n i n 1967.\n\n"his 76 per-\n\ncentage growth compares quite favorably t o t h e 46

reason f o r opposing such r u l e s of thumb i s t h a t , more often than\nnot, they run counter t o the more fundamental profit-maximizing concern of the\nshareholders.\n\nThe choice between competing f o r a m i l i t a r y o r space o r other\n\norder should be governed primarily by the expected p r o f i t , r a t h e r than merely\nhoping t o contribute t o some a r b i t r a r y s a l e s a l l o c a t i o n target.\n\nAlthough it\n\nmay a t t i m e s be forgotten i n the excitement of product development and marketing,\np r o f i t a b i l i t y i s the basic purpose of business enterprise.\nHence, maximization of the return on t h e stockholders investment can be\ntaken a s the basic goal and objective of the f i r m .\n\nThis general goal may take\n\nsuch s p e c i f i c forms as maintaining the growth r a t e of the past decade i n t o t a l\n\n8\nprofits or earnings per share or return on net worth. At times a more ambitious\ngoal can be set, in terms of a rising return.\nINTERNAL OFUEN\'JWITON\n\nThe third step in the business planning process is analyzing the capabilities\nand resources of the enterprise as a guide to the kinds of things that it can do.\nThe following list is suggested, not as exhaustive but as indicative of the\ncharacteristics of the typical defense/space firm:\n1 Strong engineering design and development capability.\n.\n2\n.\n\nStrong manufacturing capability for exotic materials and close tolerances.\n\n3.\n\nDetailed knowledge of military/space markets and contractual procedures.\n\n4 Unique systems management capability.\n.\n5.\n\nAbility to bring together and work with a multitude of firms in a wide\n\nvariety of industries.\nSome negative characteristics of defense and space companies also need to\nbe noted:\n1\n.\n\nLack of broad marketing and distribution capability.\n\n2\n.\n\nLack of experience on mass production (an automobile market measured in\n\nmillions of automobiles versus sales of a few hundred jet transports a year).\n\n3.\n\nRelatively low capitalization in relation to sales.\n\n4.\n\nLack of experience in designing, producing, and servicing consumer and\n\nindustrial products.\n\n5 Highly limited and specialized equipment.\n.\nAfter such a frank evaluation of a company\'s true assets and liabilities,\nthe business planner can proceed to the development stage. It should be noted\nthat the assets and liabilities are relative to the tasks to be undertaken.\nThe seller\'s lack of a vast distribution network is of little concern to the\n\n9\nmilitary customer which maintains a substantial system of supply depots of its\nown.\n\nThe lack of mass production experience is of little interest to a civilian\n\nspace agency oriented to the design and development of relatively few numbers\nof new systems. Rather the absence of these unneeded capabilities may tend to\nkeep overhead down and to orient the company to uniquely meeting the needs of its\ngovernmental customers.\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nThe fourth step is the heart of the matter, choosing among the many different\nthings that a company can or should attempt to do in the future. I n the most\ngeneral terms, the two key questions are: What do you choose? And how do you\nchoose? Perhaps the second question should come first. On the basis of the\nsecond step of the planning process\nobjectives\n\n-- quantifying the company\'s goals and\n\n-- the choice among alternatives should be made on the basis of their\n\nrelative expected profitability in relation to the company\'s investment in them.\nThe selection of products, of course, depends on the immediately preceeding\nstep\n\n-- the analysis of the capabilities and limitations of the enterprise.\n\nAs\n\none defense industry executive commented after viewing a staff diversification\nanalysis, "I don\'t care if corn flakes are a growth industry, they\'re not for\n\nUS".\n\nViewing the long series of unsuccessful performances at commercial diversification, many defense/space companies have thrown up their hands at any\nfurther attempts. It is not surprising that company managements are reluctant\nto move from fields they have mastered, and feel at home in, to lines of business\nquite alien to them. Their lack of knowledge of non-defense/space markets is\n\n,\n.\n. .\n8See M. I Weidenbaum and A B Rozet, Potential Industrial Adjustments to\nShifts in Defense Spending, Menlo Park, California, Stanford Research Institute,\n\n1963, 74 PP.\n\n8\n\n10\n\npervasive\n\n-- covering products, production methods, advertising and distribution,\n\nfinancial arrangexents, funding of research and development, contracting forms,\n\nand the very nature of the customer\'s demand.9\nThe real strength of these companies is their technical capabilities. The\nstrong and often unique characteristics of the defense/space corporations are\nengineering accomplishment, technical systems management, meeting major national\nrequirements, and serving governmental markets. How to mate these capabilities\nwith the requirements of non-defense business is both the challenge and the\nproblem.\nIt may be that the limitations of defense/space companies are not controlling\nin some carefully selected segments of the civilian economy. This may be the\nca~e\nfor new product and market areas involving advanced technology, rather\nthan in established fields, where the competition is with well-entrenched firms.\nThere are many persons who believe that, at least in the long run, there must\nbe a useful commercial return on the large national investment in defense/space\nresearch and development. The most frequently cited examples of such potential\n10\n\napplications are in five areas:\n\n1 Improvements in surface forms of transportation. The alternatives here\n.\ninclude mass urban transportation systems, integration of existing surface\ntransportation systems, highway safety and traffic control systems, modernizing\nthe merchant marine, and developing an alternative to the passenger automobile\nfor personal transportation. In some of these cases the most difficult barriers\nmay not be technological but political, social, and institutional obstacles to\n\n.\n\nchange\n\nr\'\no\nF\n\'\nan earlier analysis along these

In all\nprobability, the result is the almost inevitable "planner\'s gap".\n-.\n--\n\nThat is, if\n\nthe projection is far enough into the future, the most optimistic sales line\nbegins to sag and to fall behind the postulated targets. On the other hand,\nmechanically adding up all the possible systems and products which are recommended\nby the various divisions results in a major share of the future growth of the\nnation\'s GNP being absorbed by company X.\nThis last phase of the business planning process involves closing the loop.\nThe reasonableness of the goals and targets set earlier can themselves now be\nchecked against the likely accomplishments of the enterprise in view of its\nresources and capabilities. Necessary modifications may then be made in the goals\nand targets as well as in the programs to accomplish them.\n\n16\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nO the basis of the foregoing analysis, the following guidelines a r e suggested\nn\nf o r developing d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n s t r a t e g i e s f o r defense/space companies.\n1 Put f i r s t things f i r s t\n.\n\n-- devote\n\nthe bulk of the firm\'s resources and\n\nenergies t o the basic defense/space product l i n e s .\n\nPerheps t h i s guideline should\n\nbe rephrased t o read, "do not t r y t o diversify unless the top management i s\nconvinced t h a t it r e a l l y has to".\n\nThe past h i s t o r y of defense/space industry\n\ncommercial d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n i s surely l i t t e r e d with a vast a r r a y of f a i l u r e s .\nDiversification, i f anything, i s exploration i n t o the r e l a t i v e l y unknown, a\nrisky and r e l u c t a n t l y undertaken, although often rewarding, a c t i v i t y .\n\n2\n.\n\nPlan and a c t on diversification plans when the company i s " f a t and happy".\n\nHence, engage i n t h i s venture when the corporation i s i n the strongest position\nt o bear the r i s k and additional investment required.\n\nTraditionally, b u r s t s of\n\nenthusiasm f o r d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n occur when a defense cutback i s already upon the\nindustry o r when an individual company loses a major competition.\nexception t o the trend should be noted (perhaps a new trend).\n\nA recent\n\nMcDonnell acquired\n\nDouglas as it was approaching the peak o f i t s s a l e s and earning power, not when\nit already faced a plateau o r decline.\n\nIt i s , of course, too e a r l y t o evaluate\n\nt h e success of t h i s break with tradition, but the expectations a r e high.\n\n3.\n\nDo not be a d i l e t t a n t e\n\no r none a t a l l .\n\n-- e i t h e r make a major e f f o r t a t d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n\n\nSo many defense/space companies do exploratory work on a v a r i e t y\n\nof commercial p o s s i b i l i t i e s , because they can afford to.\n\nPerhaps it a l s o soothes\n\nt h e concerns of shareholders who are distressed over the narrow product and\nmarket base of the company.\n\nHowever, i n s o many cases management l a t e r backs o f f\n\nfrom making the major commitment of development funds on the basis of f a c t o r s it\nwas w e l l aware of before the i n i t i a l e f f o r t ever s t a r t e d .\ntype of corporate games-playing o r wheel-spinning.\n\nThis i s an expensive\n\n4 Concentrate on applications and extensions of the company\'s basic\n.\ncapabilities. The successive moves from aircraft to missiles to space represented, in retrospect, fairly clear extensions of the basic capabilities of\naircraft and electronics companies. Nuclear energy and oceanographic efforts\nseem to follow in that tradition. Educational systems, new towns, and foreign\neconomic development just do not, at least at present, seem to possess that\nclear and close connection t o the basic strengths and capabilities of defense\nand space companies.\n\n5.\n\nDo not expect too much too soon. Few defense/space companies win as\n\nmuch as one out of every three maJor competitions they enter. Yet, these same\nfirms often expect their first diversification effort to be a success. There\nmay be a learning curve here too; diversification may be something that a company\nhas to learn after many trials and errors.\n\nCharacteristically, defense/space\n\ncompanies are farsighted in planning and development efforts in their basic product lines, expecting many years of exploratory research, development, and\nmarketing effort to precede a successful competition. In contrast, the time span\nset for evaluation of commercial diversification is often far shorter.\n\nUpon\n\nreflection, the penetration of a new market would be expected to be a more rather\nthan less time-consuming process than product development in the company\'s basic\nmarkets\nAs\n\na concluding note, it might be appropriate to make proper mention of the\n\npatron saint of business planning, whose spirit no doubt is present at all\ndiscussions of defense/space industry diversification. It may not be generally\nknown, but the patron saint of business planning is the famous Scottish poet,\nthe late Robert Burns. Of course, his claim to this position is based on a single\nline of his poetry which can be translated into contemporary English as "the best\nlaid plans of mice and men still can get fouled up".\n\nAppendix\nREPRESENTATIVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE UTILIZED\nSPACE CR D F N E TEXXI?OLOGY I u OTHER FIELDS\nEX S\np\'\n\nAerojet-General Corporation\nAerojet primarily supplies the propulsion portion of missile and space\nsystems.\n\nIt a l s o produces torpedos, nuclear equipment, and oceanographic research\n\nvessels.\n\nIt has attempted a great number of non-defense and space d i v e r s i f i c a t i o n\n\ne f f o r t s requiring i t s engineering force.\nengineering work f o r several c l i e n t s .\ne parcel s o r t i n g system f o r the U.\n\nI t s Atlantic Division performs systems\n\nThese have included designing and i n s t a l l i n g\n\nS.

One example is the plasmagun system, which provides\n\n-\n\nan economical means of coating many comon materials, extending their useful\napplications and increasing their durability. Another example is a series of\nshock test machines, originally developed as part of the Titan missile program,\nwhich have been sold to aircraft companies to simulate and check landing shocks\nfor commercial aircraft production.\nIt appears that during most of the post-World War I1 period AVCO has attempted\nas company policy to expand its commercial work. Major corporate impetus appears\nto have been present during periods of slack military business.\nAVCO is in a state of transition. In 1963, 76 percent of its sales and\n\n60 percent of its profits came from government work. In 1966, about 70 percent\nof earnings are expected to come from commercial operations. In part, this shift\nrepresents a number of acquisitions involving little if any transfer of personnel\nfrom government to commercial work at least at the present time. For example,\nsince 1964 it acquired the Bay State Abrasive Products Company, the Delta Acceptance\nCorporation, radio stations W W E , AM and FM, television station WOAI, and the\n\nt\nIowa Finance Company. I also formed a new corporation, Meredith-Avco, Inc., to\nengage in the community antenna television field.\nBoeing Companx\nBoeing is a producer of long-range bombers (B-52\'s, now modification work),\nmilitary and commercial jet transports, I I Ms space boosters, gas turbines, and\nC3 \'\nnavy hydrofoil vessels.\n\n727\n\nIts major diversification effort has been the 707\n\n- 737 line of commercial jets.\n\n- 720 -\n\nThis was derived from the same company-financed\n\nprototype--the so-called dash 80--on which the KC-135 military tanker was based\nand drew on the company\'s extensive experience with large military jet aircraft\n\n21\n\n(B-47\'s end B-52\'s).\n\nThe 7 7 family represents the major comercial utilization\n0\n\nof Boeing engineers.\nA much smaller effort was the line of gas turbines, which is now being\n\nphased out.\n\nOriginally developed for the Navy as auxiliary power for minesweepers,\n\nthese small gas turbine engines also were used on fire engines and light aircraft,\nbut sold in disappointing numbers.\nBoeing Associated Products attempt to market a great number of by products\nof the basic aerospace product line, including medical devices (such as electrocardiographs, respiration meters, thermometers, and electroencephalographs), a\nfluidized bed furnace, and thickness gages. However, this division of the company\nwent the licensing route and utilized perhaps a handful of engineers for product\nevaluation and marketing efforts.\nThe commercial share of being\'s sales has risen from an insignificant\n0\n96\nportion in 1958 to about 5 percent in 1965 and exceeded that in 1 6 . The 707\n\nprogram was designed and developed as an integral part of Boeing operations.\nHence, the flow of personnel back-and-forth between commercial aircraft and\nmilitary work was both continuous and commonplace.\nCurtiss-Wright Corporation\nThe company manufactures rocket motor cases, propellers, simulators and\nother components for aerospace and industrial products.\n\nCurtiss-Wright is the\n\nunfortunate example of a major defense company that tried so hard to diversify\nthat it lost most of its military business but also was unable to make a success\n\nof its commercial ventures. Most of the latter were acquisitions, many of which\nhave been sold off.\nMost of Curtiss-Wright\'s transfer of technology and employees from government\nto commercial work results from its subcontracting position in the aircraft\nindustry.
