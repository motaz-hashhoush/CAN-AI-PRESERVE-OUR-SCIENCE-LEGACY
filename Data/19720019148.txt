This\ndocument has been prepared under NASA/ARC Contract NAS 2-6523 and submitted in\nresponse to contract Specification and Work Statement A-17193 and related specifications and attachments.\nThe objective of the study was to use the baseline preliminary design developed\nfor the Bioexplorer spacecraft under the previous NASA/ARC Contract NAS 2-6027,\nand devote further study effort in areas of thermal control, attitude control and power\nsubsystem design, and evaluate the use of the Space Shuttle Vehicle (SSV) as a potential\nlaunch and recovery vehicle for the Bioresearch Module (formerly called Bioexplorer).\nThe results of the study are to include: a refinement of the baseline design definition of a Bioresearch Module as a Scout-launched payload to accomplish Missions I and\nII as defined in the specification; an evaluation of the design impact of using the SSV to\nlaunch the Bioresearch Module for Missions I, II and III and recover Missions I and II;\nand a preliminary definition of the Space Shuttle Vehicle/Bioresearch Module interfaces\ninvolved in the conduct of the missions defined.\nThe Final Report is submitted in three (3) volumes. Volume 1 contains the results\nof the technical work performed during the study in accordance with the contract work\nstatement. Volume 2 presents the updating and modifications to the Preliminary Spacecraft Development Program Plan developed under Contract NAS 2-6027, as influenced\nby the results of the changes or revisions to the design, development, fabrication and\ntest programs as determined and evaluated during the conduct of this Bioresearch\nModule Study. Volume 3 - the Management and Funding Plan - provides a description\n\nIII\n\nI-1\n\nof the proposed project organization; communications; documentation and reports;\nproject planning, direction and control; related experience and facilities; and cost\nestimate data and options for the implementation of the Bioresearch Module development program.\nThis volume is Volume 3 - Management and Funding Plan.\nThe experienced systems engineering and design and analysis personnel, as well\nas senior quality assurance, manufacturing and test personnel, who were available at\nGE-RESD from the recently completed NASA Bioexplorer Study Program were utilized\nto conduct and support the study phase and spacecraft development planning for the\nBioresearch Module Project.\nBesides- fulfilling the final report requirements of the Bioresearch Module Study\nContract, GE-RESD hopes that the material furnished in these three volumes can\nserve as a basis for continued work and planning leading to the crystallization and\nimplementation of a viable and on-going Bioresearch Program. To any future development phases, GE-RESD offers its unique resources of experienced technical and\nmanagement personnel, facilities and flight-proven hardware designs resulting from\nthe development and flight of numerous space systems programs, including its demonstrated performance and directly applicable experience from NASA\'s series of Biosatellite space biology missions.\nGE-RESD welcomes the opportunity to be of additional service to the Bioresearch\nModule Project in terms of preparing and/or conducting presentations and proposals\nwhich NASA/ARC may consider useful to the interpretation of the material furnished\nherein or to the contribution of follow-on program implementation planning.\n\nIII\n\nI-2\n\nI. MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\nA. SUMMARY\nThe General Electric Company has been in business for almost eighty years and has\nevolved a diverse product line involving many technologies. Because of the corporate\nstructure, the resources of the total company are available to assist in the successful implementation of the Bioresearch Module Program.\nThe Re-entry and Environmental Systems Division is uniquely qualified to manage and\ndirect the Bioresearch Module Program because it has broad experience in space\nsystems ranging from re-entry systems to orbiting spacecraft, thus involving all of\nthe technology areas associated with the space program. In addition, it is currently\ninvolved in non-aerospace areas of work actively applying space technology to such\nthings as water and air pollution, housing, ocean systems, and medical and health\ncare problems.\nGE-RESD offers the capability of the team that developed the Biosatellite spacecraft/\nexperiment system for the conduct of the Bioresearch Module Program. This team\nbenefitted from six years of design, development, integration, and operations experience\nin conjunction with the NASA/Experimenter team. A considerable portion of the funds\nexpended on this program were devoted to development of the team capability to perform the specialized task of biological experiment/spacecraft equipment design,\ndevelopment and operations. This team is now on the most cost-effective portion of\nthe learning curve required to perform the Bioresearch Module Program.\n\nm\n\n1-1\n\nFrom the Biosatellite Program, GE-RESD has learned how to provide the management\nand technical resources to meet the stringent requirements of space biology flight\nmissions. In the process, rapport and respect between the engineer and biologist has\nbeen established which greatly enhanced the efficient implementation of this space\nbiological research program.\nThe management plan furnished herein includes the proposed project organization\nfor the conduct of the Bioresearch Module Program, communication and documentation procedures, methods for controlling project planning and direction, and additional\nGE-RESD qualifications in terms of related experience and facilities. The funding plan\nprovides time-phased funding requirements for various elements and options of the\nproposed program compatible with: (1) the Bioresearch Module designs modified from\nthe baseline Bioexplorer preliminary design, as discussed in Volume 1; (2) the Bioresearch Module Development Program Plan furnished in Volume 2; and (3) the Cost\nAnalyses Guidelines provided in NASA/ARC Letter PEF-204-5(169L), dated September\n3, 1971.\n\nB.

The flow\nchart shall include components, subsystems, and systems, as well as covering interface compatibility and verification tests. The ITPP shall also make reference to procedures for special testing required by such items as "one shot" devices (e. g.,\nbatteries, pyrotechnics, etc. ) or for the effects of shelf life, diagnostic performance\ntests or similar screening. On approval of the ITPP, all revisions, deletions or\nadditions will also require NASA review and approval.\n3.0 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RELIABILITY PLANS\nPlans for implementing both Quality Assurance and Reliability procedures for the\nBioresearch Module shall be prepared and submitted within 90 days from contract\nfor NASA review.\n4. 0 INTERFACE DEFINITION AND CONTROL\nIn conjunction with NASA/ARC, General Electric will designate a point of contact to\nbe specifically responsible for developing interface definition and control procedures\nfor the Module/Experiment interface and the Module/Launch Vehicle interface.\nAuthority will be vested in the GE representative to accept, by signature, the defined\n\nIII\n\n1-7\n\ninterfaces or changes thereto and, should untimely changes affect existing design and\nfabrication schedules and thereby increase costs, it shall be the responsibility of the\ninterface control representative to obtain and report such affects to NASA in lieu of\naccepting the proposed change to the interface.\n5. 0 TECHNICAL REPORTS AND DATA\nAll technical reports, specifications and data pertaining to the development of the\nBioresearch Module shall be forwarded to NASA/ARC for review and/or approval.\nSuch documents include system, subsystem and component specifications, drawings,\nanalyses, test data and discrepancy reports. A listing of such reports categorizing\nthose requiring NASA approval, as opposed to those forwarded for information, shall\nbe negotiated on award of contract.\n6. 0 TECHNICAL PROGRESS REPORTING\nInformal Monthly Technical Progress Reports shall be prepared and forwarded to\nNASA/ARC for each month from the start of the contract through completion. Such\nreports shall contain a summary of the work accomplished covering significant events,\nproblem areas, proposed resolution of problems, and planned work. A final technical\nreport covering the complete development of the Bioresearch Module program shall be\nprepared and submitted within 90 days from program completion.\n7.0 TECHNICAL MEETINGS AND REVIEWS\n7. 1 Design Reviews\nTwo major and comprehensive design reviews shall be held at GE-RESD for NASA/\nARC approval during the Bioresearch Module design phase. The Preliminary Design\nReview (PDR) shall be held approximately 3 months from contract award; a Critical\nDesign Review (CDR) shall be held approximately 10 months later. Two weeks prior\n\nmI\n\n1-8\n\nto each design review, a data package,- consisting of the technical material to be\npresented at the meeting, will be forwarded to NASA/ARC for their information.\nAction items resulting from the meeting shall be assigned, scheduled, tracked, and\nreported through the Project Manager\'s office.\n7.2 Technical Direction Meetings\nTechnical Direction (T. D. ) Meetings shall be held at 8 to 10 week intervals starting\n90 days from contract award and held alternately at GE-RESD and NASA/ARC.\nItems to be presented and an agenda for the meeting will be recommended by General\nElectric to NASA two weeks prior to the meeting date. Minutes of the meeting, including all assigned action items and agreements, shall be prepared by GE and issued\nwithin two weeks following the meeting.\n7.3 Pre-Ship Review\nOn completion of the Bioresearch Module testing, and prior to shipment from GE-RESD,\na Pre-Ship Review Meeting will be held at GE-RESD for NASA/ARC.\nAll credentials for acceptance of the Bioresearch Module will be presented, reviewed,\nand supported by inspection and test data. The cognizant quality assurance manager\nshall co-chair the meeting with the project manager to provide complete supporting\ndata for NASA review.\nD. PROJECT PLANNING, DIRECTION, AND CONTROL\n\nThe Bioresearch Module Project Manager\'s responsibility for planning, direction, and\ncontrol will be greatly facilitated by the team concept, which will permit efficient\ncentralized planning, scheduling, and program execution in one location.\nA key feature of this one-location team concept is that the Project Manager c\'an, by\ndirect communication with his team members, plan and implement the varied tasks\n\nIII\n\n1-9\n\ninvolved to produce a well-integrated engineering design. The walls of this centralized\narea will be utilized for network charts similar to those employed for the Biosatellite\nControl Room (scoped, of course, for the Bioresearch Module Program requirements).\nA logic network of significant events, along with contractual schedule constraints,\nwill be developed from which optimum schedules for program tasks can be determined, as well as identification and interdependencies of critical paths. The system\nprovides excellent visibility on status, progress, and problem areas, is easily modified and updated and provides an excellent method for defining, planning, and identifying\naction plans to ensure their compatibility with overall objectives and requirements.\nTwo basic documents, issued and controlled by the Project Manager, will be used to\nprovide and confirm official planning for program objectives, requirements, execution,\nand cost control. These documents are as follows:\n(1) Program Planning Instruction (PPI) - This document defines what is to be\ndone and when, in accordance with contractual and specification requirements. It provides the overall Program guidelines and baselines to the\nfunctional organizations for their detailed planning. The detail planning, in\nturn, is fed back to the Project Manager for review and updating during the\nlife of the program.\n(2) Program Directives (PD) - These directives are issued to the functional\norganizations to provide definition of the work to be performed, the time\nperiod during which it is to be done, and the authorized funding level. The\nPD\'s establish the shop order structure, tasks to be performed, milestone schedule, and time-phased funding to provide an integrated control\nfunction between the Project Manager and the performing operations. The\nPD is the official document by which the Project Manager exercises cost\nand schedule baseline definition and control.\nIn addition, the Project Manager will receive weekly manpower and financial reports\nfrom which he will determine variances in manpower and costs and in turn initiate\nand implement any corrective actions necessary to fulfill the requirements of the PPI\nand PD.\n\n1-10\n\nE. RELATED EXPERIENCE AND FACILITIES\n\n1. 0 INTRODUCTION\nGE-RESD has extensive experience and capabilities in spacecraft design, development\nand flight operations. In addition, the Division may draw upon the many specialized\nresources of the Company thus broadening these capabilites and assuring the fulfillment of program requirements in an expeditious manner.\nThe facilities required are currently available and include those necessary for office\nand laboratory space, manufacturing, assembly and test.\nThis section provides a summary of related experience and the facilities available.\n2.0 RELATED EXPERIENCE\n2. 1 Systems Management\nGE -RESD has been involved in the space program for fifteen years and has in-depth\nexperience in the design, development and operation of complex systems. Programs\nhave included the development and production of both ballistic and re-entry (or\nout-of-orbit) systems.\nDuring this period, contracts for more than 30 separate flight vehicle programs were\nawarded and involved more than 500 spacecraft flights. The breadth of experience\ngained in these programs is summarized in Figure I. E-1.\nSystems management has been a key factor in many of these programs. For example,\non the Air Force 698BJ Recoverable Satellite Program, GE-RESD was responsible\nfor design integration of the payload, vehicle and Agena Booster, command and control\nsystems, engineering qualification tests, vehicle flight test program, reliability program, personnel subsystem, MAB systems test, operational mission support, onstation AGE, recovery support and data reduction.\n\nIII\n\n1-11\n\nIF\n\n8J\n\nII\nII\nII\n8\n8\nII\n\n>\'\n\nI\n\nz\n\nII\nII\nII\nII\nIq\nS\nt\nI\n\n=13L:\n\nI8\n00000055\n\nt4543\n-,\nI\n\n2\no .F _\n5< < 5 5 5\n,a\n855082555I\n\n605<0<000\n\nEI\n4-a\n\n8$\n\n8ni<<\n.<8\n5(\'\n\n.0\n\n>, oo~t06\n\n>\n\n55a88\n\n-4-\n\n4--\n\n-\n\nI5I\n\ni\na\n\n.\n<..0\n\n-o\n\n& ?\n\n<25585z\n80\n\nP~~~oo<\n\n-0\n\n0000\n\n,z000\n\n-\'\n\n<0j\n\n0\n\n-\n\n00<:\n\n<\n\nC.)\n\n0\n\n~\n\n~\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n5=~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5\n&M\nPC\n\n~\n\nC)\nC1)\n0\n\n5\n\n4\n\nI\n\n~\n\n;rtB,s\nI\nA\n--\n\nI-\n\nla\n\n~\n\n4->\n\nII\n\n~ ~ ~\n\n0\n\n~\n\nag~\n\n0<\n\n2~\n\nE\n\nE\nle\n\n5<~ao\n\n~~e\n\n--,, 8-~~~~~~~7,\n\n8<8<< \'~" 0 s0\n<\'\xc2\xabS 58\n\n45E:"3\n\n=<<<~=\n\nr--\n\n-:3 WI-\n\na\n\n_C) ;\no 0\n0 -4\n\nI\n\n.\n\nI\nl-\n\n-~~ 8 2 5\n\nIC)\n\nd\n0 \'\n< 0\n\n0 _\n02\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\nX-\n\n100\n\nz> XF52\nSx\n8 888-\n\n8\n\n_\n\n-_8a>EpoEo8\n\ni\n0\nI\n\n05\n\nzE.\n\n9""~S~\n\no.\n\n~ ~~\n\n=~\n\n<8d\n\nU\n\n-oI\n\n8H8a\n\n~\n\n--\n\no,,r\n\n8\noH\n\n6<\n\n8\niSt\n5\n\n<-\xc2\xbc\n\'\n\nHU~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n8\n\nI.UA\n\no~\n\n5555s88~\n\n5<<<o-<\n\n2O5\n\n-S0\n\nLuj\n=0 I\n\n~\n\n<\n\n-C-\n\ncn\n\nC)9i\nPT,\n\nM\n\n.4\n\n<06\n\nI d\nU-.5~\n\n0 0\n2\n\n58\n\ni\nII\n\n8\n\n026&\n\nf\nE\n\n5-<_QY<L\n\n60006\nZ\n\nz\n\nsj\n\n4-i\n\n_5o0\n\nLI\n\nU\n\n6$~~s\n\n=~\xc2\xb7iB0\n\n0888H2F-0505- \xc2\xb0\nt; 3 \'\n0_<\ng\n83\n80 5556.525 _5\n-\n\n5\n\nI\n4A\n\n-5.0\n\n<0P\n\n~>~F\'\n\nIW\n\nI\n\n5~\n\n655<20\n\ng~~r~g~802250<0.0.0<\n\n=5WCY~F\n58YY\n\nU2\n\nf.%32~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nh ct\n\n0*\n\n0\n\n~~00<0\n\n0\n\n-"\n\n00=oo8\'.<6\n-~6\n\no~5o\n868<\n\na0\n\n;raE.~\n\n250.\n\n4X\n\n-\n\n-\n\n0\n\n5o00\n\n,28\n\n<s=\n000\n\n0\n\n~\xc2\xb7L\n\n-<\n55<\n\n.00\n<0<00005:\n<:-~.\n<<>.<\n_\n_\n_\n\n__\n\n_ odyiC"\n_\n\n88<8o-\n\n<ogoO\n____\n\n____\n\n_\n\nSz\n\n\'oooao~o\noooo200<\n_\n____\n\no.,.o\n\n0000\n___\n\nO\n___\n\nw\n\nC\n\n4\ntA1#\n\n-\n\nII\n05\n\n7r\n\n0\n\n:\n\n2:-\n\nL\nI\n\n--\n\n0-C\n\nII\n\n0 tIC\n-\n\n888 0\n\n4 .0\n0\n\nI8\n\nH5\n\nF.\n\n0\n\no~~~~\n\no\n\n2 3\n\n<00\n\n59 <\n\n---- <\n00\n\n-\n\noo.56oo\n\n-<o~~o;~~5~~\n\ni0\n\n0\n\n05\n\n.5~\n\n6- o\n\n-\n\n0<5\n\n~\n\n\'As\n\n~\n\nn\n\no s\n\n12 11\n55\n\n56855\n\n~~\n\n~\n\ns855\n\n~\n\ns-\n\n<\n0< <<~0\ne~~\n_\n<<00<055\n\no08\n000\n000\n<00<0\n\n0\n\n00=5<\n\n0\n=0\n\n=5a\n<o\n00\n\na\n\ns\n\n852\n\n0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n55k65 00\n51\n58~\'~\n85ru\n\n<0\n\n8\n\n000s~Z\n0~\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n<<<<<~>..\n1a\nd~S~4F4_~\n<055555.5\n\n~s;\n\n0\n*5o\n\no~;:55\n\no~o~o8559\n\n3~~-\n\n5\n\n0\n<082\n0\n<5<\nOE\n\nS~\n8\n\n5\n\n0~\n\ni2\n\n2<~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n_~s~e~~~\n\n0\n0<6\n-o\n\n~\n\n<0\n2z\n\n5\n\ns5<<\n\nE~ 5<5ooo\n8\n3\n;s~5s5\xc2\xbe\n000~0\n0000<o<00\n\n<<0000~\n<38o558\n.\n8~~~~$\n\n~\n\n~\n\nj~~"\'"\n\n8mj\n0\n\n5<0\n\n<o08\n\n__<88~\n\n000\n\n548\n\nt7\n\nI5\n\n0<00~~ss89\n\n=<0 <0\n55<523~\n\n000\n888<.=5\n\n58U\n\n~\n\n<0\n\n00<0000~\n\n~825~\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~2\n\n~\n\n<ooo\n\ns068=\n8~s\n\n00\n5~~~~~~~~~88858\n\nE~~~B\n\n25885\n-\n\n00\n\n~ ~~\n~\ng ~~~sE~000\n~~~~~00<<05\n34"\'\n~\n~~ ~ X~8\n~\n\np\n\n4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0\n\n5\n\n~~sg\n\ns 6 .5 0\n0< 0\n0\n000\n<0<00\n0<OSHOSH< 88\n0\n\n0 < H=895\n\nEE\n\n5\n\nt3\n\n0\n00<0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~d\n0~Ub~ .\'\n8555.58.\n06a~tbP"\n0\nKI\nC\n\n20\n=X~8~\n\n~\n\n5\n0\n\n=\n\n5 <<\n6E~g-e\n\nY,~~~~~~~~~~o0\n\nLI\n\n5\n\n\'5oro\n\n00000<<0<o\n\nO2oSo\n\n~\n~~~~~0\n~ ~\n\n8\n\n<<5&508555<o~\n\n~ ~\n\nu\n\n88\n\n<880<O85005<\nO\n<0 <~~a~\no\n58\n<0\noo\n\n~\n\n<g45\n\n5\n\na~-\n\n-\n\n8\n\n0<00<006600000o<\n\n<60\n\no~es~\n0<0\n\nn~~~~B\n\n-\n\ns-\n\n0<~~~~ <<os\n\na\n\nE 58\n\n80<g\n\n0\n\n~~a4\n92~~~~~~~~~"";\'\n\n555\n\n08\n\n<\n\n0\n\n<0<006000<<.<.\n<o\n0\n\n0<0=0<800\n\na~~~q~~\n0\n\n<52 t\n\n--\n\n08~~s"~\n<00\n\n2585588<58\n\n<5\n<58\n\n-4\n\n<85I\n\n-ys\n\n<0\n..\n\n0 05<\noS\n\n5<\n\n_\n\n0 <0F 5\n8<I\n\na~~~~~~~r~~~ubn~~~~~E-g2E^\n\n<o<.505\n\n~;~s~~~pq;$\n\n9Y_\n\nbI < E.

In the\nNASA Biosatellite Program, GE-RESD designed and built a number of space laboratories to study the effects of relatively long-duration flights on a wide variety of plant\nand animal specimens in controlled environments that could not be duplicated on\nearth. Ames Research Center managed this project for NASA.\nFlights were made in December 1966 and September 1967 to study the effects of\nweightlessness and radiation on several simple organisms. A third flight was made\nduring June and July 1969 to study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on a primate; specifically, its brain functions and performance, cardiovascular functions,\nmetabolic functions, and the bone density changes in various sites of the skeletal,\nanatomy.\nThe primate mission of Biosatellite was fully successful throughout every subsystem,\nalthough the well-being of the primate necessitated deorbit and recovery of the capsule after 8 days in orbit. The service module, or adapter, continued to perform\nall functions completely satisfactorily for 38 days while exercising all operating\nconditions. The Biosatellite spacecraft had a 40-inch base diameter recovery capsule\nwith a suspended weight of 325 pounds at recovery. The service module or adapter\ncontaining the telemetry, command, power, tankage, attitude control, and basic\nenvironmental control subsystems, extended the length of the spacecraft to 82 inches\nwith a 55-1/2-inch diameter at the base. Other than the Apollo Command and Service\nModules, Biosatellite is the most sophisticated spacecraft yet flown by the United\nStates.\n2.2.2 Discoverer Orbital Re-entry/Recovery Spacecraft\nThe Discoverer recoverable satellite, designed, developed, and fabricated by GERESD, was the first space vehicle in the world to be recovered from orbital flight.\n\nIII\n\n1-13\n\nThe Discoverer vehicle was 33 inches in diameter, 40 inches long, and weighed approximately 300 pounds. The design consisted of an outer ablating heat protection\nsystem and an inner recoverable capsule system. The payloads varied from instrumentation to a complete, active, closed-loop life support system for biological\nsubjects. The Discoverer successfully flew in August 1960, and the program subsequently demonstrated a 99-percent recovery success score.\n2.2.3 NIMBUS\nUnder contract to NASA-GSFC, GE\'s Space Division was responsible for the design\nand development of selected vehicle subsystems (e. g., attitude control and structure),\nvehicle integration and overall systems testing of the fully oriented Nimbus weather\nsatellite. This program has been highly successful with in-orbit operations exceeding\nthe six-month requirement by many months.\n2.2.4 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory\nGeneral Electric was responsible for the design and development of the stabilization\nsubsystem on a subcontract to Grumman for the NASA Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO). This highly precise subsystem has performed very successfully on OAO\nflights.\n2.2. 5 Mariner \'71 Attitude Control\nGE\'s Space Division has completed a subcontract with JPL for the Mariner \'71 attitude\ncontrol subsystem.\n2.2.6 ERTS.- A and B\nThe design and development phase for the Earth Resources Spacecraft system is in\nprogress at GE Space Division which is scheduled for first launch in 1972 under\ncontract to NASA/GSFC.\n\nIIm\n\n1-14\n\ni\n\n2. 3 Manned Systems\n2. 3. 1 Space Shuttle Vehicle (SSV)\nAnother project organization under the Space. Re-entry Systems Programs Section\nof GE-RESD is the Space Transport Systems Programs which has been actively teamed\nwith the North American Rockwell Corporation under NASA contract for the Phase B\nSpace Shuttle Vehicle Studies. The prime area of responsibility of the GE project\nteams is the design/development of the reusable surface protective insulation paneling\nfor the SSV Orbiter. This also affords a current knowledge of the SSV mission planning,\noperational scheduling and orbiter configuration as applicable to the Bioresearch\nModule.\n2. 3.2 Space Manipulator\nThe Cybernetics Automation and Mechanization Systems Operation is a Schenectady,\nN. Y. based section of GE-RESD reporting directly to Mr. Walter D. Smith, General\nManager of Space Re-entry Systems Programs. This organization has been actively\ninvolved in the development, design and application of several manipulator and handling\nsystems. A current NASA program is a Man-Mate boom for use in a NASA simulation facility. This system will be used to demonstrate the feasibility of handling\nmajor assemblies in space such as in-orbit assembly or servicing of spacecraft or\nthe transfer or retrieval of material by the Space Shuttle Orbiter Vehicle. Such programs afford an insight to the SSV manipulator system configuration and capability\nas applicable to the Bioresearch Module.\n2.3.2 Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL)\nGeneral Electric was an associate prime contractor for the Air Force MOL, with\ncomplete responsibility for experiment integration. Of particular interest to the\nBiopayload Integration Task is the work done in the areas of crew man-mission timeline analysis and simulation. In addition, General Electric developed techniques for\ndynamic computer control of experiment execution.\n\n1-15\n\nWork on the MOL began in September 1965 and continued until project cancellation\nin May 1969.\n\nAt its peak, approximately 2, 500 GE people were engaged on the project.\n\n2. 3. 4 Space Station Integration\nGeneral Electric\'s Space Division at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is a team member\nand major subcontractor to the North American Rockwell Space Division in the conduct\nof the Phase B Space Station Study. General Electric\'s effort involves two major tasks:\nexperiments definition and integration, and information management. In addition, GE\nis responsible for certain other subordinate subsystems, such as waste management,\nsolar and/or nuclear power, and control moment gyros.\nGeneral Electric\'s experiment definition and integration responsibility encompasses\nall scientific disciplines. On the advice of NASA, candidate experiments are selected\nfrom the "Blue Book" for conceptual hardware implementation and integration into the\nstation complex. In the context of experiment definition, General Electric has complete responsibility for biomedical and behavioral measurement studies.\n2.3.5 TEKTITE I andII\nThe Tektite undersea exploration program is conceived for a dual purpose. The\nfirst is to establish the feasibility of manned operations for long duration in confined\nenvironment, investigating both physiological and psychological problems. The\nsecond is concerned with the conduct of a comprehensive marine biological research\nprogram.\nTektite I was a highly successful 50-day program, concluded in April 1969.\n\nFour\n\naquanauts were "housed" at 50-foot depth off St. John in the Virgin Islands. The\nhabitat was supplied and partially outfitted by GE-RESD.\n\nThe Navy Department,\n\nNASA, and the Department of the Interior participated in the program.\n\nIII\n\n1-16\n\nTektite H, the successor program, involved a much broader governmental and academic institutional support. The program was of seven-months duration, with seventeen separate "missions" accomplished during this period. Although overall objectives\nwere the same, research was more sophisticated and far broader in scope. The\nDepartment of the Interior was the lead governmental agency in Tektite II.\n\nGE-RESD\n\nagain supplied personnel and the underwater "habitat" at 50-foot depth.\n2. 4 Biomedical Programs\n2. 4. 1 Patient Monitoring Study\nGE -RESD recently completed a study of the application of bio-space technology to\npatient monitoring systems under contract to NASA. In this study, NASA-developed\ntechnology was applied to cardiovascular and pulmonary patient monitoring in order\nto improve the availability, reliability, and utility of data for medical diagnosis and\ntraining. General Electric has been working in conjunction with the Lankenau Hospital and Hahnemann Hospital to develop the specific equipment and techniques for\nsuch a system. A portion of the study was devoted to a survey of existing patient\nmonitoring systems currently in operation at various hospitals. The merits of each\nwere then analyzed and the requirements established for an advanced system which\nutilizes bio-space technology. Currently a supplementary program is in progress to\nadapt and evaluate a urine transport, measurement and storage system based on the\nBiosatellite Primate Urine System.\n2.4.2 Health Communications System\nImproved health care communication systems have been proposed for several states\n(e. g., Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Missouri) for the demonstration and implementation\nof communications systems which will link remote areas of the state to medical centers\nlocated in the metropolitan areas. These systems utilize space-developed technology\nto improve health care in areas with more limited medical personnel or diagnostic\ncapabilities.\n\nIII\n\n1-17\n\n2.4.4 IMBLMS\nGeneral Electric has been performing on a NASA/MSC contract to develop an Integrated\nMedical and Behavioral Laboratory Measurement System (IMBLMS).\n\nIMBLMS is\n\nintended for use in early space station complexes and the subsequent space, lunar,\nand inter-planetary craft that progressively evolve. The IMBLMS will be initially\nused in the conduct of biomedical and behavioral experiment measurements, and with\nnormal evolution, will progressively develop diagnostic, therapeutic, and remedial\nmeasurement capability for systems incorporation.\nPhase B-3 (NASW-1630), completed in February 1970, was for the design, fabrication, and delivery of a functional breadboard. Included in the contract were tasks\nfor the limited testing, data analysis, and delineation of requirements for design of\nan engineering development unit.\nIMBLMS Phase B-4 (NAS-9-10741), started in May 1970, is intended to produce preliminary flight design and planning in sufficient depth that the C and D phases can be\naccurately costed. The system not only includes capability for some 130 medical,\nbehavioral, and laboratory analysis measurements, but also through its biopotential\nsignal conditioners, data acquisition and display subsystem, and computer, provides a\ncapability for supporting bioscience experiments. This phase is presently nearing\ncompletion and follow on work is anticipated.\n2. 5 Program Support Capability\n2. 5. 1 Quality Assurance and Reliability\nGE-RESD procedures relating to quality assurance and reliability are fully compliant\nwith the NASA requirements contained in the NCP 200 series and NPC 250-1.\n\nThese\n\nprocedures were instituted at GE-RESD in 1963 in anticipation of the Biosatellite Program and have been continually refined and further elaborated while in use in the\nensuing period.\n\nIII\n\n1-18\n\nGE-RESD has available, the Biosatellite Quality Assurance, Reliability, and Test\nEvaluation team, procedures, facilities, and equipment that demonstrated a successful Biosatellite Primate Mission, including a no-hold countdown to launch, under the\ndifficult restraints of the experiment integration. This capability was developed\nfrom the quality and reliability of the system from the component level through system\ntests and prelaunch checkout of the spacecraft.\n2.5.2 Fabrication\nGE-RESD has fabricated the basic structural components and heat shields of more than\n30 re-entry and recovery vehicle systems developed over the last 15 years. In\naddition, the Division makes its own electrical harnesses, components, sensors,\nand aerospace ground equipment. Extensive experience has been gained in integration\nand assembly of complex subsystems and systems; this experience is further enhanced\nby electronic miniaturization programs currently underway that result in considerable\nsavings in weight and power requirements. The Biosatellite Program, because of its\nhigh degree of sophistication, added immeasurably to these highly developed experiences\nin fabrication and assembly. The life support system, along with its detailed requirements for gas management, food and water supplies, and waste handling, further\ndeveloped the RESD capabilities in material selection and handling, process developments including sterilization, and meticulous fabrication and assembly techniques\nfrom piece-parts through components and subsystems to the system itself.\nAll of the plans and procedures developed during the accumulation of this extensive\nfabrication and assembly experience will be directly applicable. It is envisioned that\nan optimum Bioresearch Module Development Plan will result from using these proven\nplans and procedures in a sound and efficient manner.\n2.5.3 Testing\nThe General Electric Company has organized progressive test programs for its\nsystems to establish confidence and eventual flight readiness. The testing of the\n\nIII\n\n1-19\n\nBiosatellite spacecraft is an example of a progressive test program starting with\ndevelopment testing through qualification testing. On such programs, the test plan\nis used to define the test building blocks, and test specifications are developed to\nprovide the instructions for implementation. Data processing requirements are\ndefined to provide the best formats for analysis and evaluation of the test results.\nOn the Biosatellite Program, these programs included high-speed reformatting,\nlimit checking, high-speed printer display, and automatic changing of limits according to the test requirements. The systems are analyzed in a Failure Modes and\nEffects Analysis, and any component failures during test are studied, firstly, from\nthe aspect of component quality/reliability; and secondly, from the potential operational impact in a Mission Critical Function Analysis. From these evaluations, confidence matrices are developed for each critical and major function as the basis for\npre-launch and in-flight contingency plans.\nAn Integrated Test Program Board is always organized by General Electric to have\ncognizance over all qualification testing including the design of the test plan and test\nspecifications, and the implementation, data analysis, and acceptance. These inplace test plans and procedures which are use-proven from the cited extensive test\nexperience can be directly tailored to the Bioresearch Module Program.\n3.0 FACILITIES\n3. 1 General\nGeneral Electric Re-entry and Environmental Systems Division (GE-RESD) maintains\na variety of facilities which have been used for many study, analysis, research, and\ndevelopment activities and which are available for continuing application to spacecraft,\nre-entry systems, urban systems, ocean systems, health systems, and aerospaceoriented programs. The same basic facilities used for the Biosatellite Program would\nbe allocated to the Bioresearch Module.\n\nmi\n\n1-20\n\nThe GE-RESD Center, located at 3198 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nserves as the Division\'s headquarters. The Center provides approximately 670, 000\nsquare feet of laboratory, developmental manufacturing, test and office area. GERESD also maintains 385,000 square feet of offices and laboratories in the nearby\nsuburbs at the GE -owned Valley Forge Space Center, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania,\nand the Cabot, Cabot and Forbes Industrial Park, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\nExtensive technical and specialized facility resources of the General Electric Company are available to support the diversified activities of GE-RESD. These facilities\ninclude such well-known organizational components as General Electric\'s Space\nSciences Laboratory, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; General Electric\'s Research and\nDevelopment Center in Schenectady, New York; and the Electronics Laboratory,\nSyracuse, New York.\n3.2 Laboratories\nThe Division operates a number of specialized laboratories which conduct research\nand exploratory development in support of various programs.\nThe Environmental Sciences Laboratory provides support in the areas of bio-medical\nresearch, environmental pollution, weather prediction, lasers, radiation and shock\nphysics, oceanography, and hypervelocity flight.\n\nrU.\n\nThe Experimental Biology and Biochemical Laboratory has, in addition to standard\nbiological and chemical investigation equipment, a complex of biological, chemical\nand radiobiological equipment. Work is currently being conducted in the areas of\nbacterial sensors, coliform detectors, electron capture gas chromatographic analysis,\nand electrocoagulation of waste water.\n3.3 Manufacturing and Assembly\nGE-RESD maintains a modern manufacturing, fabrication and assembly capability\nwhich is equipped and staffed to meet the quality and reliability standards for space\nprograms.\n\nIII\n\n1-21\n\nA machine shop, sheet metal shop, and heavy machining area are all tooled to\nsatisfy the requirements for hardware at typical R&D production rates. Other manufacturing facilities include; a complete plastics fabrication and bonding facility, an\nelectronics wiring and assembly shop, and a model and template fabrication shop.\nSupporting these activities are; manufacturing engineering, production control, tool\nand equipment design, purchasing, stock control, and the traffic and shipping units.\nAssembly of the Bioresearch Module will be done in the former Biosatellite assembly\narea. This is a laminar flow facility. An air conditioning and absolute filter bank\nsystem, separated from other building systems, maintains a positive pressure within\nthe area preventing the inward flow of particles and other contaminants. Maximum\ncleanliness levels are attained by performing assembly operations adjacent to the air\ninlet filter bank with personnel and equipment downstream from the hardware.\nDressing rooms are separated from the assembly area and access to the assembly\narea is via an air shower.\n3. 4 Test Facilities\nThe test facilities required for the development and qualification testing of the Bioresearch Module system and its components are currently in existence at GE-RESD,\nwith the exception of a centrifuge suitable for conducting the acceleration tests. For\nthis test, it is recommended that a centrifuge located at the Sandia Corporation in\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico, be used. General Electric has used this facility on several\nre-entry vehicle programs in the past.\nIn addition to the environmental facilities that are required, system tests will be\nconducted in the clean manufacturing assembly area mentioned previously.

FUNDING PLAN\nA. GROUND RULES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe ground rules and assumptions are as follows:\n(1) The funding requirements were estimated for the design, development, test,\nqualification, pre-launch and launch support and operational flight support for\ntwo each Type I Bioresearch Modules and two each Type II Bioresearch\nModules.\n(2) Launch of the four modules is to be accomplished by use of the Scout Launch\nVehicle at one year intervals starting in February 1975, with the Type I to\nbe launched first and second in the series and Type II to be launched third\nand fourth in the series.\n(3) Prototype system design, development, test and systems qualification cost\nestimates are furnished for the Type I system; for the Type II mission, the\nattitude control subsystem would be qualified as a subsystem module.\n(4) The design and development definitions and requirements for estimating\npurposes were based on the following sources:\na.\n\nThe baseline design of the Bioexplorer spacecraft as defined under the\nprevious Contract NAS 2-6027, modified by the results of this Bioresearch Module Study as documented in the Design Review Reports Nos. 1\nand 2 of this contract and Volume 1 of this final report.\n\nb.\n\nThe updated development program plan as defined in Volume 2 of this final\nreport.\n\nc.\n\nThe overallnetwork schedule for the prototype Bioresearch Module development\nprogram as presented in Section II-B of this volume.\n\n(5) Assumed program go-ahead is July 1, 1972, with completion of the prototype\nsystem qualification by May 31, 1974. (Note: Attitude Control Subsystem\nModule qualification extends to June 30, 1974).\n(6) Pre-launch support at Wallops Island has been estimated for a maximum of\nsix weeks prior to each launch, and flight support estimates are for an\naverage of four months per flight at NASA/ARC and NASA/GSFC.\n\nIII\n\n2-1\n\n(7) Mission III requirements serve as a design commonality restraint, but\nestimates for Mission III peculiar tasks are not included.\n(8) The program schedules presented in Section II-B of this volume, reflecting\nvarious program milestones, events and activities, were used to time-phase\nthe funding requirements.\n(9) No estimates are furnished for any Bioresearch Module AGE once the Module\nis attached to the last stage of the Scout and turned over to the launch vehicle\ncontractor for final pre-launch processing.\n(10)\n\nThe S-band system-is the baseline for the TT&C subsystem for all missions.\nFor in-house testing, it is planned to utilize the MK-12 S-band ground station.\nFor field testing, it is assumed that a GFE S-band ground station will be\nmade available.\n\n(11)\n\nEstimates for Experiment AGE and handling equipment are not included.\n\n(12)\n\nFour program options for flight Bioresearch Modules fabrication, assembly\nand acceptance testing were identified, analyzed and evaluated as presented\nin Section II-B of this volume.\na.\n\nOption I - Conduct the program through prototype system qualification,\nretain the prototype as a ground system, fabricate and procure all the\nparts and components for four flight modules during the same early period,\nand assemble and test the four flight modules on the most efficient accelerated schedule.\n\nb.\n\nOption II - Same as Option I except assemble and test the four flight\nmodules consistent with the yearly launch schedules.\n\nc.\n\nOption III - Same as Option I except that the prototype system would\nserve as the first flight Module. (The remaining three flight modules\nwould be processed on the accelerated schedule.)\n\nd.\n\nOption IV - Same as Option III, except the remaining three flight modules\nwould be processed consistent with the yearly launch schedules.\n\nNote: The four optional plans are presented for purposes of report\ncompleteness. However, at the Bioresearch Module Design Review No. 2\nconference, held at NASA/ARC on November 9, 1971, it was jointly\ndetermined that Options II and IV should be actively considered, and that\nno further investigations or evaluations of Options I and III be conducted.\n\nIII\n\n2-2\n\n(13)\n\nFor the Bioresearch Module development and qualification test program, a\nGFE experiment package simulator will be provided; and for system flight\nacceptance testing, a GFE flight experiment package will be furnished.\n\n(14)\n\nFor vendor items, quotes were updated from the data acquired during the\nprevious Bioexplorer Study in response to seventeen (17) individual work\nstatements and specifications prepared for each of the following items\ncurrently planned for procurement:\nRate Gyro\nMomentum Wheel\nSun Sensor\nDeployable Rods\nSolenoid Valve\nLatch Valve\nRegulator\nFilter\n\n(15)\n\nHi-Pressure Transducer\nLo-Pressure Transducer\nNitrogen Tank\nDecoder\nReceiver, S-Band\nTransmitter, S-Band\nTracking Receiver\nData Storage Unit\nSolar Cell Panels\n\nFunding requirements were estimated by calendar quarter, by labor class,\nand by material.\n\n(16) The ground rule established for qualification testing is that such tests will be\nconducted on the component and system levels. The acceptance testing program ground rules are:\na.\n\nComponents: In-process, functional performance, and operability\nassurance (OA) testing.\n\nb.\n\nSubsystems:\n\nc.\n\nSystem: In-process, functional performance, and operability assurance\n(OA) testing.\n\nIn-process and functional performance testing.\n\n(17) For estimating purposes, the following component hardware requirements\nground rules were utilized.\na.\n\nNew Design Components\nQuantity\n\nTotal\nmI\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\n1\n9\n\nPurpose\nComponent Development Test\nSubsystem and System Development Test\nComponent Qual Test\nSystem Qual Test\nFlight Units\nSpare\n\n2-3\n\nb.\n\nMajor Modification Components\nPurpose\n\nQuantity\n1\n1\n1\n1\n4\n1\n9\n\nTotal\nc.\n\nComponent Development Test\nSubsystem and System Development Test\nComponent Qual Test\nSystem Qual Test\nFlight Units\nSpare\n\nExisting or Minor Modification Components\nPurpose\n\nQuantity\n1\n1\n4\n1\n7\n\nTotal\nd.\n\nSubsystem and System Development Test\nSystem Qual Test\nFlight Units\nSpare\n\nStructure\nPurpose\n\nQuantity\n\nTotal\ne.\n\n1\n1\n4\n1\n7\n\nMock-up\nSubsystem and System Development Test\nFlight Units\nSystem Qual Test\n\nHarnesses\nPurpose\n\nQuantity\n\nTotal\n\n1\n1\n4\n1\n7\n\nMock-up\nSubsystem and System Development\nFlight Units\nSystem Qual Tests\n\n(18) Major Equipment Requirements\na.\n\nMock-up Unit - Early model built to engineering sketches using soft\ntooling.
