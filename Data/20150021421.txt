ABSTRACT TITLE\nSLS Scale Model Acoustic Liftoff Acoustic Environment Test Results and Comparisons\n\nII. ABSTRACT (PLEASE ENTER ABSTRACT OF 200 WORDS OR LESS.\n\nENCLOSE ATTACHMENTS AS NEEDED)\n\nThe liftoff phase induces acoustic loading over a broad frequency range for a launch vehicle. These external acoustic environments\nare then used in the prediction of internal vibration responses of the vehicle and components which result in the qualification\nlevels. Thus, predicting these liftoff acoustic (LOA) environments is critical to the design requirements of any launch vehicle. If\nthere is a significant amount of uncertainty in the predictions or if acoustic mitigation options must be implemented, a subscale acoustic\ntest is a feasible pre-launch test option to verify the LOA environments.\nThe NASA Space Launch System (SLS) program initiated the Scale Model Acoustic Test (SMAT) to verify the predicted SLS LOA\nenvironments and to determine the acoustic reduction with an above deck water sound suppression system. The SMAT was conducted\nat Marshall Space Flight Center and the test article included a 5% scale SLS vehicle model, tower and Mobile Launcher. Acoustic\nand pressure data were measured by approximately 250 instruments. The SMAT liftoff acoustic results are presented, findings are\ndiscussed and a comparison is shown to the Ares I Scale Model Acoustic Test (ASMAT) results.\n\nIII.
