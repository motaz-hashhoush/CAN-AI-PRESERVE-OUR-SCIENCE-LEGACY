This presentation will discuss some of the various AM processes, components, testing and development efforts for spaceflight applications at NASA used on launch vehicles and propulsion systems. \n- AM process comparisons and selection for spaceflight applications.\n- Novel alloy development, characterization, and maturation for extreme environments.\n- Infusion and maturation of AM components into development and flight applications.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20220009298, "endDate": "2022-06-24T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "866942f982f94dfd8497b61f4b0d8770", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Marcus Evans Group", "location": "Chicago, Illinois, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a1fb5a0009b14d029556240f8988fc21", "id": "d6d4f478e81c45c096ca905ff5e32152"}], "name": "Aerospace & Defense Manufacturing & R&D Summit", "location": "Las Vegas, NV", "id": "a1fb5a0009b14d029556240f8988fc21", "url": "https://www.aerospacedefensesummit.com/", "startDate": "2022-06-23T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220009298, "id": "e161c1b5d26b4417b6141d3a4f331bef", "publicationDate": "2022-06-23T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Metal Additive for Spaceflight_AeroDef_June2022.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220009298/downloads/Metal%20Additive%20for%20Spaceflight_AeroDef_June2022.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220009298/downloads/Metal%20Additive%20for%20Spaceflight_AeroDef_June2022.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220009298/downloads/Metal%20Additive%20for%20Spaceflight_AeroDef_June2022.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
