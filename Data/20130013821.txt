b'individually packaged components for\ncompactness. Each transceiver was designed on a single PCB with a custom enclosure providing interior walls and compartments\nto\nisolate\ntransceiver\nsubsystems from radiated interference.\nThe enclosure also acts as a heat sink for\nthe voltage regulators and power amplifiers inside the system. The PCB transceiver design produces transmit pulses of\n\n2 W with an arbitrary duty cycle. Each\ntransceiver is fed by an external 120-MHz\nsignal transmit and two 1,140-MHz local\noscillator signals. The received signal is\namplified and downconverted to 120\nMHz and is fed to the data processor. The\ntransceiver dimensions are approximately\n3.5\xc3\x9711.5\xc3\x970.6 in. (9\xc3\x9729\xc3\x971.5 cm).\nThe PCB transceiver design reduces\nthe volume and weight of the DBSAR\n\ninstrument while maintaining the functionality found in the original design.\nBoth volume and weight are critical for\nairborne and flight remote sensing instrumentation.\nThis work was done by Matthew McLinden\nand Rafael Rincon of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

The software treats each\nprocessing step in either a communications or navigation modulator or demodulator system as an independent,\nthreaded block. Each threaded block is\ndefined with a programmable number\nof input or output buffers; these buffers\nare implemented using POSIX pipes. In\naddition, each threaded block is as-\n\n10\n\nsigned a unique thread upon block installation. A modulator or demodulator\nsystem is built by assembly of the\nthreaded blocks into a flow graph,\nwhich assembles the processing blocks\nto accomplish the desired signal processing. This software architecture allows the software to scale effortlessly between single CPU/single-core computers or multi-CPU/multi-core computers without recompilation.\nNASA spaceflight and ground communications systems currently rely ex-\n\nclusively on ASICs or FPGAs. This software allows low- and medium-bandwidth\n(100 bps to \xe2\x89\x8850 Mbps) software defined\nradios to be designed and implemented\nsolely in C/C++ software, while lowering\ndevelopment costs and facilitating reuse\nand extensibility.\nThis work was done by Greg Heckler of Goddard Space Flight Center.
