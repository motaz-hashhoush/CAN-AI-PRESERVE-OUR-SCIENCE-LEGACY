b'Katherine Yarbrough\n\n10/29/2015\nRisky Business\n\nDuring my internship I worked on two major projects, recommending improvements for the\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Risk Management Workshop and helping with the strategic planning efforts for Safety and\nMission Assurance (S&MA). The risk management improvements is the key project I worked on this\nsemester through my internship, while the strategic planning is the secondary assignment. S&MA\nBusiness Office covers both aspects in its delegation, getting both spans some of the work done in\nthe office.\nA risk is a future event with a negative consequence that has some probability of occurring. Safety\nand Mission Assurance identifies, analyzes, plans, and tracks risk. The directorate offers the Center a\nRisk Management Workshop, and part of the ongoing efforts of S&MA is to make continuous\nimprovements to the RM Workshop. By using the Project Management Institute\xe2\x80\x99s (PMI) Standard\nfor Risk Management, I performed a gap analysis to make improvements for our materials. I\nbenchmarked the PMI\xe2\x80\x99s Risk Management Standard, compared our Risk Management Workshop\nmaterials to PMI\xe2\x80\x99s standard, and identified any gaps in our material. My major findings were\npresented to the Business Office of S&MA for a decision on whether or not to incorporate the\nimprovements. These suggestions were made by attending JSC working group meetings, HSE panel\nreviews and various risk review meetings. The improvements provide better understanding of risk\nmanagement processes and enhanced risk tracking knowledge and skills. Risk management is an\nintegral part of any engineering discipline, getting exposed to this section of engineering will greatly\nhelp shape my career in the future. Johnson Space Center is a world leader in risk management\nprocesses; learning risk management here gives me a huge advantage over my peers, as well as\nunderstanding decision making in the context of risk management will help me to be a well-rounded\nengineer.\nStrategic planning is an area I had not previously studied. Helping with the strategic planning efforts\nin S&MA has taught me how organizations think and function as a whole. S&MA is adopting a\nbalanced scorecard approach to strategic planning. As part of this planning method strategic\nthemes, objectives, and initiatives are formed. I attended strategic theme team workshops that\nformed the strategy map for the directorate and gave shape to the plan. Also during these\nworkshops the objectives were discussed and built. Learning the process for strategic planning has\nhelped me better understand how organizations and businesses function, which also helps me to be\na more effective employee.\nOther assignments I had during my internship included completing the Safety and Mission Assurance\nTechnical Excellent Program (STEP) Level 1, as well as doing a two week rotation through the Space\nExploration division in S&MA, specifically working with a thermal protection systems (TPS) engineer.\nWhile working there, I learned about the Orion capsule and the SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. I\nattended meetings to prepare the engineers for the upcoming Critical Design Reviews for both\ncapsules and reviewed test data. Learning risk management, strategic planning, and working in the\nSpace Exploration division has taught me about many aspects of S&MA. My internship at NASA has\ngiven me new experiences and taught me numerous subjects that I would have otherwise not\nlearned. This opportunity has expanded my educational horizons and is helping me to become a\nmore useful engineer and employee.\n\n'
