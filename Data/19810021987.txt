b'SOLAR BRAYTON WGINE/ALTERNATOR SET\n\nL Six and R. Elkina\n.\nGarrett Turbine Engine Company\nPhoenix, Arizona\nABSTRACT\nGarrett\'s work on the Mod 0 solar Brayton engine/alternator set is\nbeing redirected to utilize solarized components of the automotive\nadvanced gas turbine (AGT) being developed by Ford and Garrett under\ncontract to NASA. The new configuration is referred to as the Mod I.\nCommercialization of solar Brayton engines thus should be enhanced not\nonly by relating the design to an engine expected to reach the high\nquantity, low cost production rates associated with the automotive\nmarket, but also by the potential the AGT components provide for\ngrowth of efficiency and power rating. This growth would be achieved\nthrough use of ceramics in later versions making operation possible at\ntemperatures up to 2500\xc2\xb0F.\nThe longer program duration and higher\ncost of the Mod I is considered compatible with the extended schedule\nof the application and the system test program for which the Brayton\nengine/alternator set is first intended. Subject to fuading availability, the initial solarized AGT should be under test by Nov 1981,\nand a complete Mod I engine/alternator set d=liverable approximately\none year later.\nThe Mod I will operate at 1500\xc2\xb0F turbine inlet temperature (TIT). and\nproduce 23 kw shaft output power at about 32 percent shaft efficiency.\nGrowth versions incorporating ceramic parts will be capable of operation at 2100 to 2500\xc2\xb0F TIT and should develop 51 to 7; kw shaft power\nat efficiencies from 40 to 48 percent.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper will report the status of the design, procurement and test\neffort by Garrett under NASA/DOE Contract DEN3-181.\nThe purpose of\nthis effort is to provide Brayton engine/alternator set hardware for\ndemonstration of parabolic dish solar electric power modules.\nWhen conunercialized, the solar power modules will be the building\nblocks of dispersed solar power plants ranging in size from a few\nkilowatts to systems up to 10 megawatts. The concept of a dispersed\npower plant consists of combining the electrical output from the\nrequired number of identical solar power modules. The modules would\nbe controlled from a conveniently located substation where any final\npower conditioning also would be performed. Each module would comprise a concentrator, a receiver, and an engine/alternator (E/A) set\nsometimes referred to as a power conversion subsystem (PCS). The E/A\nset hardware being procured under Contract DEN3-181 is expected to be\n\nevaluated at JPLgr Parabolic Dish Test Site at Edwards Air Force Base,\nCalifornia. The E/A set will be part of an experimental solar power\nmodule that also includes a test bed concentrator m d a Garrett so7ac\nreceiver.\nDurinu the period from February to July of 1980 the analysis aSld\ndesign of the Mod 0 engine/alternator set was essentially completed.\nThe resulting configuration which is shown in Figure 1 reflectabd the\ninitial guiielines, a low risk approach with minimuq program cost and\nschedule. The Mod 0 design was based on use of the turbocompresssr\nfcorn the GTP36-51, a high performance state-of -the-art gas t u ~ b i r ~ e\nrecently designed for producticn rates up to 1000 per year as an Army\ngenerator set, two GT601 truck gas turbine pr~duction configuratinn\nrecuperator cores, acd an off-the-shelf Bendix 400 Hz alternator. At\nthe lSOO\xc2\xb0F TIT limitation, set by the intended use with a metallip\nsolar receiver, the estimated Mod 0 shaft efficiency was 30 percent.\nRedirection of the contract effort to a Mod I design was initiated in\nJuly 1980 to replace the Mod 0 components with more advanced components designed with lower cost higher production rates in mind. The\nMod I design selected by JPL includes solarized versions of the turbocompressor and regenerator from the automotive advanced gas turbine\n(AGT) under development by Ford and Garrett on NASA Contract DEN3-167\nand a new permanent magnet alternator (PMA). This selection was made\non the basis that these components would reduce the overall cost and\nschedule for achievin~ a commercialized Br ayton engine for the solar\npower market in the 1990\'s.\nThis Mod I engine/alternator set (see Figure 1)\nwill operate at\n1500\xc2\xb0F and produce 23 kw of shaftpower at about 32 percent shaft efficiency in the initial metallic version.\nWhen ceramic AGT housings\nbecome available from the automotive program, the solarized version\nwith a ceramic receiver should be capable of operation to 2100 to\n2500\xc2\xb0F where the shaft output power and efficiency should be 51 to 7 1\nkw and 40 to 48 percent respectively.\nMOD I COMPONENTS\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the key design changes made to improve the commercialization potential of the Brayton engine generator set.\nThe\nsolarized GTP36-51 turbocompressor and GT601 truck recuperator cores\nwere replaced by the solarized P G turbocompressor and regenerator.

The slab gearbox and off-the-shelf 400 Hz Bendix alternator\nwere replaced with a direct driven permanent magnet alternator to be\ndeveloped specifically for this solar application. The PYA will be\ndesigned to also perform as a synchronous starter motor when supplied\nwith suitable power from a dual converter. The dual coq-.verter is so\nnamed because it also serves as the output power conditioning element,\ncontrolling and converting the alternator high frequency output to\n60 Hz ac during periods of power generation. This alternator start\ncapability wiil eliminate the need for a separate starter such as the\nhydraulic starter, included for reasons of expediency, in the Mod 0.\nMOD I PERFORMANCE\nThe range of possible maximum power design points for the Mod I engine\nis plotted on Figure 4 with two illustrative choices\n"A" and "B"\nidentifi-d. When ceramic housinqs and a 17-meter dish become available, the maximum rated shaft power can be 51 kw with the engine\noperating at 2100\xc2\xb0F and 90,600 rpm, (Point "B").\nAt this desigr,\npoint, the use of a gearbox will probably be required since the power\ndelivered at engine shaft speed is too great for present day direct\ndrive permanent magnet alternator technology. Initially, for use with\nthe existing 1500\xc2\xb0F metallic solar receiver and the 11- to 12-meter\ndishes, the engine design point (Point " A " ) will be 23 Rw and 80,200\nrpm. For reference, the Mod O design point (Point C) also is shown on\nthe figure.\nThe 80\xc2\xb0F sea level design speed for Point "bn was chosen to allow\nadequate margin for operation at other ambier~t conditions.\nFor\ninstance, if the same enqine/alternator set were installed at\n5000 feet and operated on a clear hot day, the engine speed must\nincrease to absorb the concentrator heat output from 90,600 rpm to\napproximately 100,000 rpm, which is the AGT turbocompressor design\nlimit.\nPart -load characteristics of the Mod I engine corresponding to the two\npreviously identified des\'gn Points " A " and "Be are shown on Figure 5.\nCurrently, the part load control strategy is to hold the variable\ni?let guide vane (IGV) angle constact at about 20 degrees from full\nopen for a 1500\xc2\xb0F rating and reduce engine speed to match reduced\nthermal outputs from the solar concentrator and receiver. Note that\nthis control strategy results in mu\nhigher part load efficiency than\ndoes holding the speed constant. From Figure 5, it is apparent that\nthe efficiency is essentially constant over the 100 to 50 percent\npart-load power range.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates other changes that were incorporated to upgrade\nthe Mod I concept to more closely represent a commercialized configuration. The slab gearbox and off-the-shelf 400 Hz Bendix alternator\nwere replaced with a direct driven permanent magnet alternator to be\ndeveloped specifically for this solar application. The PMA will be\ndesigned to also perform as a synchronous starter motor when supplied\nwith suitable power from a dual converter. The dual converter is so\nnamed because it also serves as the output power conditioning element,\ncontrolling and converting the alternator high frequency output to\n60 Hz ac during periods of power generation. This alternator start\ncapability will eliminate the need for a separate starter such as the\nhydraulic starter, included for reasons of expediency, in the Mod 0.\nMOD I PERFORMANCE\n\nThe rang.; of possible maximum power design points for the Mod I engine\nis plotted cn Figure 4 with two most probable choices "A" and "B"\nidentified. When ceramic housings and a 17-meter dish become available, the maximum rated shaft power will be 51 kw with the engine\noperating at 2i00\xc2\xb0F and 90,600 rpm, (Point "B").\nAt this design\npoint, the use ~f a gearbox will probably be required since the power\ndelivered at engine shaft speed is too great for present day direct\ndrive permanent magnet alternator technology. Initially, for use with\nthe existing 150G\xc2\xb0F metallic solar receiver and the 11- to 12-meter\ndishes, the engine design point (Point " A " ) will be 23 kw and 80,200\nrpm. For reference, the Mod 0 design point (Point C) also is shown on\nthe figure.\nPoint "Bn, the 80\xc2\xb0F sea level design point for 2100\xc2\xb0F, was chosen to\nailow adequa~emargin for operation at other ambient conditions. For\ninstance, if the same engine/alternator set were installed at\n5000 feet and operated on\nclear hot d a y , the engine speed must\nincreese to absorb the concentrator heat output from 90,600 rpm to\napproximately 100,000 rpm, which is the AGT turbocompressor design\nlimit.\nPart-load characteristics of the Mod I engire corresponding to the two\npreviously selected design Points "A" and "B" are shown on Figure 5 .\nCurrently, the part load control strategy for the Mod I is to hold the\nvariable inlet guide vane ( I G V ) angle constant at about 20 degrees\nfrom full open and reduce enqine speed to match reduced thermal outputs from the solar concentrator and receiver. Note that this control\nstrategy results in much higher part load efficiency than does holding\nthe speed constant. From Figure 5, it is apparent that the efficiency\nis constant over the 100 to SO percent power range.\n\n.".,*.11\n.*120..\n\n~ . n r t7\n~\n\nF i g u r e 4.\n\nI\n\nRPM x 1000\n\nDesign P o i n t Performance\n\nROTOR SPEED,\n\nGEARBOX DRIVEN ALTERWATOF\n\n-\n\n-----\n\nI\n\nDIRECT DRIVE ALTERNATOR COMPATIBILITY\n\nI\n\nLOCCOIII*C~\n\n72 METER Dl3\n\no ,) 8 0 * 0 ~ *\nl\n\nGARRETT TURBINE ENOINE C O M P A N Y\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFigure 5 .\n\nPart-Load Performance.\n\nTHERMAL INPUT POWER TO ENGINE, QE (bt)\n\ni\n\nAGT, MOD I 80\xc2\xb0F SEA LEVEL\n\nPROGRAM APPROACH AND SCHEDULE\n\nI program has been structured to accommodate vagaries of funds availability.

Therefore, redirection of the Mod 0 prog r a a was initiated by JPL. The object of the redirection was to utilize the added time and funds to upgrade the Mod 0 design to a Mod I\nconfiguration, allowing incorporation of design features that would\nenhance the ultimate commercialization of Brayton engine/alternator\nsets. The more important of these Mod I design features are summarized as follows:\nA\n\nlow cost, high production rate automotive design\n\n0\n\nA potential for growth to 40-48 percent shaft efficiency\n\n0\n\nApotentialfor growth to 5 1 - 7 1 k w s h a f t p o w e r\n\nThe Mod I program has been restructured to provide for achievement of\nmeaningful milestones consistent with the expected incremental nature\nof future funding. Two major milestones are now defined as follows:\nFirst test, solarized AGT\n\n-\n\nNcvember 1981\n\nDelivery, first Mod I E/A Set\n\n-\n\nMarch 1983\n\nThese milestones should be periodically reviewed to evaluate whether\nthey are adequate and timely for requirements such as the EE-2a ar.1\nMX-RES\n\n.\n\nPROGRAM APPROACH AND SCHEDULE\nAs shown on Table 2, the Mod I program has been structured to accommodate vagaries of funds availability.
