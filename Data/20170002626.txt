Innovation Research Technology Into Aeronautics\nResearch Mission Directorate Projects for 2016\nHung D. Nguyen and Gynelle C. Steele\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nAbstract\nThis report is intended to help NASA program and project managers incorporate Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR) technologies into NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate\n(ARMD) projects. Other Government and commercial project managers interested in ARMD funding\nopportunities through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SBIR program will find this report useful as well.\n\nIntroduction\nIncorporating Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)-developed technology into NASA projects\nis important, especially given the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s limited resources for technology development. This overview\nof the SBIR program\xe2\x80\x99s targeted research areas can help small businesses and Aeronautics Research\nMission Directorate (ARMD) project managers form partnerships to incorporate SBIR technologies into\nNASA programs and projects. For example, when ARMD program managers identify specific SBIR\nsubtopics that are likely to generate technologies that could apply to their programs or projects, the SBIR\noffice can provide information about previously developed technologies that could be incorporated into\ntheir work. Principal investigators (PIs) for small businesses can also benefit from understanding NASA\nprogram and project needs, increasing the likelihood that technologies developed by their small\nbusinesses will be integrated into ARMD projects. SBIR solicitations for the current fiscal year are posted\nat http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/solicitations.\nThe SBIR program\xe2\x80\x99s original intent was for technologies that had completed Phase II to be ready for\nintegration into NASA programs. Now the SBIR program supports its small business partners with three\npost-Phase II options that focus on creating opportunities for commercialization as well as technology\nintegration. The Phase II Enhancement (Phase II\xe2\x80\x93E), Phase II Expanded (Phase II\xe2\x80\x93X), and\nCommercialization Readiness Program (CRP) options also provide opportunities for Phase II\ntechnologies to be integrated and tested in the NASA system platform or in the space environment.\nDetails on Post-Phase II initiatives and opportunities, including funding options, may be found at\nhttp://sbir.nasa.gov/content/post-phase-ii-initiatives.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Fiscal Year 2016 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Aeronautics\nResearch Mission Directorate (ARMD) topics and subtopics.\n\nFiscal Year 2016 SBIR Subtopics and Subtopic Summaries\nFigure 1 shows ARMD topics and subtopics for fiscal year 2016; SBIR descriptions for each ARMD\nsubtopic follow here. Research topics and subtopics for all directorates are listed in Chapter 9 of the\nPhase I SBIR/STTR Program Solicitation for fiscal year 2016, available at\nhttps://sbir.nasa.gov/solicit/56329/detail?data=ch9&s=56316.\n\nA1.01 Structural Efficiency\xe2\x80\x94Aeroelasticity and Aeroservoelastic Control\nThe technical discipline of aeroelasticity is a critical ingredient necessary in the design process of a\nflight vehicle for maintaining optimal performance while ensuring freedom from aeroelastic and\naeroservoelastic instabilities. This discipline requires a thorough understanding of the complex\ninteractions between a flexible structure and the steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the\nstructure, with interactive control systems for flight vehicle performance and stability. This fundamental\naeronautics work is focused on active/adaptive aerostructural control for lightweight flexible structures,\nspecifically related to load distribution, flutter prediction and suppression, gust load prediction and\nalleviation, and aeroservoelasticity for ultra-efficient and supersonic commercial vehicles.\n\nA1.02 Quiet Performance\xe2\x80\x94Propulsion Noise Reduction Technology\nTo reduce noise emissions from aircraft, tools and technologies are needed to design aircraft that are\nboth efficient and low noise. Developments and improvements in noise reduction technology, noise\nprediction tools, and flow and noise diagnostic methods are necessary to mitigate the environmental\nimpact of aircraft noise. The focus of this call is on aircraft propulsion noise, and innovations are solicited\nin three areas: (1) Noise Reduction, (2) Noise Prediction, and (3) Noise Diagnostics.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n2\n\nA1.03 Low Emissions/Clean Power\xe2\x80\x94Combustion Technology/Emissions Measurement\nTechniques\nAchieving low emissions and finding new pathways to cleaner power are critical for the development\nof future air vehicles. Vehicles for subsonic and supersonic flight regimes will be required to operate on a\nvariety of certified aircraft fuels and to emit extremely low amounts of gaseous and particulate emissions\nto satisfy increasingly stringent emissions regulations. Future vehicles will be more fuel efficient, which\nwill result in smaller engine cores operating at higher pressures. Future combustors will also likely\nemploy lean burn concepts, which are more susceptible to combustion instabilities. Fundamental\ncombustion research coupled with associated physics-based model development of combustion processes\nwill provide the foundation for technology development critical for these vehicles.\n\nA1.04 Aerodynamic Efficiency\xe2\x80\x94Active Flow Control Actuation Concepts\nActive flow control (AFC) technology has the potential to be a key contributor to achieving NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\naeronautics goal of revolutionizing the energy efficiency and environmental compatibility of fixed-wing\ntransport aircraft. AFC is the on-demand addition of energy into a boundary layer for maintaining,\nrecovering, or improving vehicle performance. When integrated into a transport aircraft, AFC would\nresult in smaller control surfaces, creating less drag and thereby less fuel consumption during flight. This\nsolicitation is for robust, energy-efficient, reliable actuation systems with the control authority needed to\ncontrol turbulent separation, thus improving circulation on simply hinged flaps systems and other aircraft\ncontrol surfaces during the subsonic portion of the flight regime and/or to control shock-induced\nseparation on vehicles in cruise during the transonic portion of the flight regime.\n\nA1.05 Physics-Based Computational Tools\xe2\x80\x94Stability and Control/High Lift Design Tools\nDeveloping higher-order, more accurate tools suitable for conceptual design is a difficult challenge.\nTo perform the configuration trades and optimization typical in conceptual design, runtimes measured in\nseconds or minutes, instead of hours or days, are required. Additionally, because it is not possible to\nmodel every detail of the design and account for all the underlying physics in the problem formulation, it\nis difficult to predict the \xe2\x80\x9cas-built\xe2\x80\x9d characteristics with physics-based methods alone. Finally, the gap\nbetween the analysis capability and the maturity of the design being analyzed currently limits the\nusefulness of high-order analysis in conceptual design. Physics-based tools for conceptual design are\nneeded that can rapidly and accurately predict the as-built characteristics of unconventional aircraft\ndesigns while remaining consistent with the amount of design knowledge that is available at the\nconceptual design stage.\n\nA1.06 Vertical Lift\xe2\x80\x94VL Measurement Techniques and Condition-Based Maintenance\nThis subtopic is primarily interested in two areas: (1) health management of drive systems for vertical\nlift (VL) vehicles and (2) accurate measurements of lift systems and blade aerodynamics.\n(1) Health management of drive systems for VL vehicles is critical to reliable operations and safety.\nPredictive Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) improves safety, decreases maintenance costs, and\nincreases system availability. A topic of interest in CBM includes analysis capabilities and models to\nsimulate operating drive systems and components, including the modeling of realistic anomalies and\nfaults that can help design and qualify CBM systems and test their utility in making maintenance decisions.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n3\n\n(2) Accurate measurements of lift systems and blade aerodynamics are key to developing and\nvalidating high-fidelity analyses and designing next-generation high-performance vertical lift systems.\nA topic of interest is instrumentation and measurement techniques for assessing blade boundary layer\nstate (e.g., laminar flow, transition, and turbulent flow) of a rotating blade system in hover and forward\nflight conditions.\n\nA1.07 Propulsion Efficiency\xe2\x80\x94Turbomachinery Technology for Reduced Fuel Burn\nSystem and technology studies have indicated that advanced gas turbine propulsion will remain\ncritical for future subsonic transports. Turbomachinery includes the rotating machinery in the high and\nlow pressure spools, transition ducts, purge and bleed flows, casing, and hub. We are interested in\ntraditional gas turbine turbomachinery and in innovative concepts such as exo-skeletal engines,\nintercooled gas turbines, cooled cooling air, and waste heat recovery. NASA is looking for improvement\nin aeropropulsive efficiency. Areas of interest include improved components of current architectures and\ncycles, novel components and cycles to improve cycle limits, and novel architectures to improve mission\nefficiency limits.\n\nA1.08 Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ground-based test facilities play an integral role in the design, development, evaluation, and\nanalysis of advanced aerospace technologies and vehicles. These test facilities include low speed,\ntransonic, supersonic, and hypersonic wind tunnels; hypersonic propulsion integration test facilities;\nair-breathing engine test facilities; and simulation and loads laboratories. In addition to design databases,\nthese facilities provide critical data and fundamental insight required to understand complex phenomena\nand support the advancement of computational tools for modeling and simulation. The primary objective\nof the Aeronautics Ground Test and Measurements Technologies subtopic is to develop innovative tools\nand technologies that can be applied in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ground-based test facilities to enhance testing and\nmeasurement capability and improve utilization and efficiency.\n\nA1.09 Vehicle Safety\xe2\x80\x94Inflight Icing Hazard Mitigation Technology\nNASA is concerned with the prevention of encounters with hazardous in-flight conditions and the\nmitigation of their effects when they do occur. Under this subtopic, proposals are invited that explore new\nand dramatically improved icing mitigation technologies and research tools related to in-flight airframe\nand engine icing hazards for manned and unmanned vehicles. Technologies of interest should address the\ndetection, measurement, and/or mitigation of the hazards of flight into supercooled liquid water clouds\nand flight into regions of high ice crystal density. Of particular interest are technologies that can address\nemerging icing issues of advanced aircraft configurations (N+2/N+3 aircraft, as well as vertical lift and\nunmanned systems).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n4\n\nA2.01 Flight Test and Measurements Technologies\nNASA continues to see flight research as a critical element in the maturation of technology. This\nincludes developing test techniques that improve the control of in-flight test conditions, expanding\nmeasurement and analysis methodologies, and improving test data acquisition and management with\nsensors and systems that have fast response, low volume, minimal intrusion, and high accuracy and\nreliability. By using state-of-the-art flight test techniques along with novel measurement and data\nacquisition technologies, NASA and the aerospace industry will be able to conduct flight research more\neffectively and also meet the challenges presented by their respective cutting-edge research and\ndevelopment programs.\n\nA2.02 Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology\nMultiple technological barriers restrict greater use and application of Unmanned Aircraft Systems\n(UAS) in NASA research and in civil aviation. These barriers include, but are not limited to, a lack of\nmethods, architectures, and tools that enable (1) verification, validation, and certification of complex\nand/or nondeterministic systems; (2) operation of multiple UAS with minimal human oversight; (3) multivehicle cooperation and interoperability; (4) high-level machine perception, cognition, and decision\nmaking; and (5) inexpensive, secure, and reliable communications. This solicitation is intended to break\nthrough these and other barriers with innovative and high-risk research.\n\nA3.01 Advanced Air Traffic Management Systems Concepts\nThis subtopic addresses user needs and performance capabilities, trajectory-based operations, and the\noptimal assignment of humans and automation to air transportation system functions, gate-to-gate\nconcepts, and technologies to increase capacity and throughput of the National Airspace System (NAS).\nRelated concepts and technologies will seek to achieve high efficiency in using aircraft, airports, and\nen-route and terminal airspace resources while accommodating an increasing variety of missions and\nvehicle types, including full integration of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operations.\n\nA3.02 Autonomy of the National Airspace Systems\nThis subtopic encourages the development of concepts or technologies focused on increasing the\nefficiency of the air transportation system within the midterm operational paradigm (2025 to 2035\ntimeframe) in areas that would culminate in autonomy products to improve mobility, scalability,\nefficiency, safety, and cost-competitiveness. Proposals in product-oriented research and development are\nsought in (but not limited to) the following areas: (1) autonomous and safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) operations for the last and first 50 ft under diverse weather conditions; (2) autonomous or\nincreasing levels of autonomy for networked cockpit management, traffic flow management, airport\nmanagement, or metroplex management; (3) autonomicity-based (or self-management-based)\narchitectures for the entirety, or parts, of airspace operations; and (4) autonomous systems.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n5\n\nA3.03 Future Aviation Systems Safety\nThe Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) has concluded the successful Aviation\nSafety Program (AvSP). The Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP) is succeeding AvSP\xe2\x80\x99s\nsignificant achievements and stepping up to lead the ARMD research in the area of Real-Time SystemWide Safety Assurance (RSSA). ARMD sees its future safety-related research focused in a forwardlooking, more comprehensive, and system-wide direction. ARMD\xe2\x80\x99s RSSA will focus on the current and\nfuture National Airspace System (NAS), toward a gate-to-gate trajectory-based system capability that\nsatisfies a full vision for the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and beyond. The\nultimate vision for RSSA would enable the delivery of a progression of capabilities that accelerate the\ndetection, prognosis, and resolution of system-wide threats.\n\nPhase I Contract Awards\nFigure 2 indicates the number of ARMD-associated Phase I contracts awarded in fiscal year 2016.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Fiscal year 2016 Phase I contract awards associated with the Aeronautics\nResearch Mission Directorate (ARMD).\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942017-219458\n\n6\n\nARMD Program and Project Summaries\nARMD topics and subtopics strategically align with ARMD programs and projects and support the\nDirectorate\xe2\x80\x99s current needs and objectives.
