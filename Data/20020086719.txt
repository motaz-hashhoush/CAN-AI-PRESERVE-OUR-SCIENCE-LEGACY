b'Water Filters\n\nright is an Aquaspace \xc2\xae\nhe black cylinder at\nindustrial filter used\nby a pharmaceutical\ncompany to ensure the purity of\nthe water it uses. It is one of\na line of filtration products\nmanufactured\nby Western\nWater International\n(WWI),\nForesrville, Maryland. Below,\ncompany founder and president Paul M. "Mike"\nPedersen is shown in\nWWI\'s\nlaboratory sampling\nwater filtered by a WWI\nsystem.\nAquaspace\n\nfilters combine\n\ncompany technology with\nNASA technology developed\nto sterilize the drinking water of the Apollo spacecraft.\nThe filters provide clear,\ngood tasting water by removing toxic contaminants,\norganic chemical compounds, chlorine and other\nwater processing agents,\nunpleasant taste, color and\nodor.\nThe key is Aquaspace\nCompound,\na proprietary\nWTWI formula that scientifically blends various types of\nglandular activated charcoal\nwith other active and inert\ningredients.\nThe filtration\nmaterial is shown at top\ncenter around the base of a\ntypical filter system.\nAquaspace systems remove some substances\nchlorine,\n\nfor example\n\nby\n\natomic\n\nadsorption,\nother\nof organic: chemicals\nmechanical filtration, and\nstill other substances by\ncatalytic reaction.\nSeeking to find a more\neffective method of filtering\n\nPedersen\n\nEnvironment\n\nlearned\n\nhad conducted\n\nthat\n\nNASA\n\nextensive\n\nre-\n\nsearch in methods of purifying water on board manned\nspacecraft. He obtained a\nnumber of NASA technical\nreports concerning that research. NASA information\nthat contributed\nimportantly\nto the development\nof\nAquaspace Compound,\nPedersen states, included\ntechnology\n\nI04\n\nby\n\nrelated\n\nto the use\n\nof ions as filtering agents and\nmethods dealing with the\nabsorption and adsorption\nof\norganic compounds.\nAquaspace filters are finding wide acceptance in industrial, commercial,\nresidential and recreational\napplications\nin the U.S. and\nabroad. WWI produces a\nwide range of systems to\nmeet these various needs,\nfrom a simple Apollo Pocket\nFilter that works like a\n\ndrinking straw to high\ncapacity units for communities in developing nations\nwhere the water is highly\ncontaminated.\nExamples include the\nVoyager \xc2\xae filter for camping\nand traveling use (left); the\nAquaspace Counter Top Filter (below); and the Aquarius Under-the-SinkFilter\n\n(right). At right below is a\nwhole-house\nunit installed in\na laundry room. A special\nadvantage of whole-house\nfiltration in contaminated\nwater areas is protection\nfrom diseases that occur\nthrough topical absorption\ncontaminants\nthrough the\nskin and through inhalation.\n\nof\n\n\xc2\xaeAquaspace and Voyager are registered\ntrademarks of Western Water International Inc.\n\nEnvironment\n\nI05\n\n'
