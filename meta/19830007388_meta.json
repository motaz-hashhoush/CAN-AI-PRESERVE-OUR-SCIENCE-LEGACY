Axial movement of the mating seal parts was recorded by a digital data acquisition system. The coning of the tungsten carbide primary ring ranged from .51 micro-m to 5.6 micro-m. The torque of the coned face seal balanced to 76.3% was an average 42% lower, the leakage eleven times higher, than that of the standard flat face seal. The reduction of the balance of the coned face seal to 51.3% resulted by decreasing the torque by an additional 44% and increasing leakage 12 to 230 times, depending on the seal shaft speed. No measurable wear was observed on the face of the coned seals.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830007388, "id": "6ff62a7b6bcb4ebdbc1a6dfbaa2f4020", "publicationDate": "1982-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830007388.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830007388/downloads/19830007388.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830007388/downloads/19830007388.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830007388/downloads/19830007388.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
