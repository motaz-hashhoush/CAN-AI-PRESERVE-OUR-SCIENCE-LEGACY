Thus, a need exists for a new meter or apparatus,\ncapable of sensing gas flow at low rates, which is not\nlimited by the disadvantages, characterizing similar, prior\nart meters.\nOBJECTS AND SUMMARY O F TH*EINVENTION\nA primary object of the present invention is to provide\n15 a new improved fluid flow rate meter.\n\nA gas low pressure, low flow rate meter finding parAnother object of the invention is to provide a relaticular application in respiration rate studies, is disclosed.\ntively simple and reliable meter to sense low flow rates of\nIt includes a tubular member connected in the path of air\na fluid.\nor oxygen, supplied to a user from an appropriate source.\nA further object of the invention is the provision of an\nAn exciter wire is located in the tubular member.
