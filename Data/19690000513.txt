In such an assembly\nthere are as many as 70 to 75 individual flange seal\ninstallations throughout the system. Each of these installations is subject to possible leakage and requires\na careful leak detection test to ensure functional integrity. Previously, each individual flange had to be leak\nchecked by means of a flowmeter, resulting in considerable time loss and inconvenience.\n\nThe solution:\nThe new method replaces the time-consuming\nflowmeter approach with a simple, readily available\nburst diaphragm leak detector assembly mounted to\nall of the drain ports. This allows simultaneous leak\ndetection of all flange seals under actual operating\nconditions.\n\nAssembled Flexible Burst Diaphragm\n\nHow it's done:\nThe leak detector consists of a standard reducer of\nthe proper size, two stainless-steel ball seat washers,\na B-nut, or bushing. A properly sized metal diaphragm\n(nickel, silver, gold, or aluminum) with corresponding\nburst valve is inserted between the ball seat washers\nafter LOX-safe lubrication has been applied. The\nassembly is then torqued to some given value, followed\nby a 30-psig, liquid nitrogen functional leak test using\na soap solution. Any number of detectors can then be\ninstalled into flange seal leakage ports. During actual\nengine running, any leakage due to defective seal or\nflange creates a pressure buildup, ultimately causing\nrupture of the diaphragm.\n\nNotes:\nI. This information may be of interest to personnel\nengaged in the tests for leak detection in which a\ngreat number of sealed flanges require simultaneous leak checking.\n(continued overleafl\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
