The most\nmeaningful way to compare two response functions is on the\nbasis of their response to a standard spectrum over the\nsame energy range. It would be preferable to use omnidirectional response functions in order to make a meaningful\ncomparison. The monodirectional response function can only\nbe used to give an indication of the relative response. In\napplication the response function was multiplied by the\ndifferential particle spectrum and the resulting differential\ncount spectrum was integrated over its entire energy range\nto give a count total. The resulting count totals were compared.\nThe tests entailed exposing the EPS to protons from the Variable\nEnergy Cyclotron of Texas A&M University, College Station,\nTexas, and the Synchrocyclotron of Harvard University, Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, and to electrons from the 4.0 MeV Van de Graaff\nAccelerator at the National Bureau of Standards, Gaithersburg,\nMaryland.\n\n2\n\n2.0\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESPONSE FUNCTIONS\n\nAn experimental calibration program was undertaken to determine\nthe omnidirectional proton and electron response functions of\nthe various EPS sensors.\n\nSelected data from this calibration\n\nprogram were utilized to construct a monodirectional response\nfunction for each of the channels to be used as a standard\nagainst which the end-to-end test data could be compared.\n2.1\n\nProton Response\n\nProtons were obtained at two cyclotrons for the purpose of\ncalibrating the various EPS sensors.\n\nLow energy protons,\n\nfrom 8 MeV to 43 MeV, were obtained from the Texas A&M\nUniversity Variable Energy Cyclotron, College Station, Texas.\nHigher energy protons, from 52 MeV to 153 MeV, were obtained\nfrom the fixed energy Harvard University Synchrocyclotron,\nCambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nMeasurements were made at several\n\ndiscrete energies at the desired angle of incidence.\n\nIn\n\neach case, specific energies were obtained by degrading and\nscattering selected beam energies.\nFigure 1 is a diagram of the beam scattering configuration\nand proton flux calibration detector.\n\nThe solid state detector\n\nused for flux calibration is a 2.0 mm thick lithium-drifted\nsilicon detector.\n\nThe collimator is a simple brass collimator\n\nwith sufficient thickness to stop the incident protons and\nwith a hole large enough to make any collimator effects\ninsignificant relative to the transmitted beam.\n\nCommercial\n\nelectronics, suitable for use with high quality solid state\ndetectors, were utilized to amplify and count the detector\n\n3\n\nS0o\n4-)\n\na,\na,\n\n0\n0\nC\n\nI\n\nL..\nLu\n\nO\n\no\n\n.\n\n-r)\n\n-J\n\n0\n4)\n\n\'m)-1\n\nro\n-I.OL\n\ncm\n\nU0\n\n.-\n\nI\n\nz\n\nI\n\nc-U) --\n\nm\n\nct <\n\nS.-\n\nM V) LL\n\nmo\n\n0,\nUr\ncO\n\na)\nc.o\n4-)\n\nc4-\n\nLL\n\na\n\ncr\nQLU\nO: uj\n\n.X0\n\nwwCSD\n\nO\n\n~4-n\nZ\n=\nm: 3\n\nOI-~\nLULL\nL c\nu\nt\n\n4\n\nE\n.\n\noutput pulses.\n\nA bias of 500 V was applied to the detector\n\nand a pulse shaping time constant of 1.0 psec was utilized\nin the amplifier.\n\nAt Texas A&M a pair of stacked 5.0 mm\n\nlithium-drifted silicon detectors, operated at 1000 V, were\nused for proton energy determination.\n\nA 4096 channel pulse\n\nheight analyzer was used to record the output spectra of the\ndetectors.\n\nIn order to prevent pile-up of pulses in the\n\nelectronic apparatus a low flux of protons was maintained.\nEnergy calibration was achieved at Harvard University by range\nmeasurements utilizing calibrated aluminum foils and rangeenergy tables.\nFor each beam energy configuration, a calibration run was made\nto determine the beam energy and particle flux at the experimental location.\n\nAfterwards, the calibration detector was\n\nreplaced with the EPS calibration sensor for an experimental\nrun as shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe EPS calibration sensor consists\n\nof one of five shields made to the same specifications as the\nshields used on the flight system and a 2.0 mm cubical detector\nselected from the test detectors undergoing testing and\nevaluation.\n\nA special electronics system was built to have\n\nthe same specifications as the preamplifier and amplifier of\nthe flight system plus a special pulse stretcher to allow\nanalysis by commercial electronics.\n\nThe detector was operated\n\nat a bias of 350 V and a pulse shaping time constant of 360 nsec\nwas used.\n\nThe multichannel analyzer was used to record the\n\noutput spectra of the detector.\n\nA fast threshold monitor was\n\nused to provide a correction for pulses lost due to analysis\n\n5\n\n0\nV)\nc\no\n\nTO\n0\nz )0\n\nLU\n\nca\n\nCD ~\n\n.,J\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nv-\n\n1r.1.\nto\n\nTor~0\nc)\n\nw0~\n\nz\n\nCDIC\n\nC) =\nO\nC)\nC-)\n\nC,\n\nZ\n\n-)\nS\n\nU\nC)\n\n0a0\n\nEq\n\nS.OW\n\n=\n\nU*u\nIL\n\nk=\nF-\n\nCD)\n\nc:_ D=\n\n6\n\ndead time.\n\nSpectra were recorded for each of several energies\n\nwith each shield.\n\nThe pulses greater than 2.0 MeV (and 1.0\n\nMeV in channel 6) were totalized in each spectrum and divided\nby proton flux to provide a basis for comparison with the\ndiscriminator output of the Engineering Test Unit in the Endto-End Test.\n\nThe data values are given in Table I.\n\nThe\n\nresponses are plotted for each of the channels in Figures\n3 -

The Engineering Test\nUnit (ETU) was used for the tests. Five 2.0 mm cubical\ndetectors were selected from the detectors undergoing testing\nand evaluation and installed in the ETU. For the purposes\nof this test, protons and electrons were allowed too impinge\nupon each of the ETU sensors, in turn, normal to the top\nsurface of the detectors.\n3.1\n\nProton Test\n\nProtons were obtained at the two cyclotrons listed in section\n2.1, viz, at Texas A&M University and at Harvard University.\nThe various channels of the ETU were exposed to essentially\nthe same energies that were used in the calibration tests,\nbut not as many values were used. Figure 16 is a diagram of\nthe proton beam scattering configuration and the ETU. The\nEnd-to-End Test was run concurrently with the EPS calibration\nprogram, hence it was possible to use the same beam calibration\ndiscussed in section 2.1. Since the EPS has its own data\nprocessor built in, no pulse height spectra were available.\nThe processor accumulates counts above a predetermined discriminator level (2.0 MeV for channels 1 - 5 and 1.0 MeV for\nchannel 6) for a predetermined length of time. The number of\ncounts is available upon interrogation. The beam intensity\nwas monitored for the same period of time to permit calculation\nof the channel response in counts/particle/cm. The results\n2\nare given in Table III. The responses are plotted as individual\ndata points for each of the channels in Figures 17 - 22. The\ncalibration response for each channel, determined in section\n2.1, is plotted on the same graphs as a solid line for comparison.\n24\n\nQ/\n\n.4-\n\ntL\nCD\n\nz\n-I-4c.\n\nCD\nZ\nZ- L\n\nbOz\n\nLU\n\nV),\n"\'-\'\n\nI\n\no\n4-\n\nL)\n\nI\n\nm\n\nL.\n\n.
