It is an all-composite drum-rotor engine in which conventionally heavy shafts and discs are eliminated and are replaced by rotating casings that support the blades in spanwise compression. Thus the rotating blades are in compression rather than tension. The resulting open channel at the engine centerline has immense potential for jet noise reduction and can also accommodate an inner combined-cycle thruster such as a ramjet. The exo-skeletal engine is described in some detail with respect to geometry, components, and potential benefits. Initial evaluations and results for drum rotors, bearings, and weights are summarized. Component configuration, assembly plan, and potential fabrication processes are also identified. A finite element model of the assembled engine and its major components is described. Preliminary results obtained thus far show at least a 30-percent reduction of engine weight and about a 10-dB noise reduction, compared with a baseline conventional high-bypass-ratio engine. Potential benefits in all aspects of this engine technology are identified and tabulated. Quantitative assessments of potential benefits are in progress.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040040170, "endDate": "2003-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "76f37631e060408ab11d0cfbc2f821d0", "id": "f216cca9d6ad4b108ab6dcacfcc96888"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Gas Turbine Inst.", "location": "Unknown"}}, "meetingId": "76f37631e060408ab11d0cfbc2f821d0", "id": "df2f07c4f4b54228bf7f5378868cff7c"}], "name": "Turbo Expo 2003", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "76f37631e060408ab11d0cfbc2f821d0", "startDate": "2003-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040040170, "id": "207da7809fd34324883326c92ac24943", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040040170.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040040170/downloads/20040040170.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040040170/downloads/20040040170.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040040170/downloads/20040040170.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
