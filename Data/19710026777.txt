As a large, comprehensive, nonproprietary, general purpose,\nfinite element computer system for structural analysis, NASTRAN is finding\nwidespread acceptance within NASA, other government agencies, and industry.\nNASTRAN is available to the public at a cost of about $1,700, which covers\nreproducing and supplying the necessary system tapes and documentation.\nFurthermore, NASA has provided for the continuing maintenance and improvement\nof NASTRAN through the establishment of a NASTR.AN Systems Management Office\nlocated at the Langley Research Center. At present, NASTRAN is in use at over\nsixty locations, including NASA centers, other government agencies, industry,\nand commercial computer data centers.\nBecause of the widespread interest in NASTRAN and because of a desire to\nbetter serve the comm.unity of NASTRAN users, the NASTRAN System Management\nOffice organized a NASTRAN Users\' Colloquium at the Langley Research Center,\nSeptember 13-l5, 197J.. The colloquium was planned to provide to everyone concerned an opportunity to participate in a comprehensive review of the current\nstatus of NASTRAN use, including the rate of user acceptance, unique applications, operational problems, most desired modifications including new capability, and comparisons with other less comprehensive applications programs.\nIndividuals actively engaged in the use of NAS\'l\'RAN were invited to prepare\npapers for presentation at the colloquium. These papers are included in this\nvolume. Only a limited editorial review was provided to achieve reasonably\nconsistent format and content. The opinions and data presented are the responsibility of the authors and their respective organizations.\nJ.P.

Weidman,\nand Howard M. Adelman\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nNASTRAN, as the largest, most comprehensive, nonproprietary, general\npurpose, finite element computer system for structural analysis in existence\ntoday, is finding widespread acceptance wi thin NASA, other government agencies,\nand industry. The purpose of this paper is to describe the present status of\nNASTRAN (NASA Structural Analysis) and to outline goals and objectives for i ts\nfuture maintenance and development by the NASTRAN Systems Maintenance O\nffice .\nSTATUS\nBackground\nNASTRAN was developed under the direction of Mr. T. G. Butler, NASAGoddard Space Flight Center, during the years 1 965 to 1970. Upon completion of\nthe development phase, the management of NASTRAN was transfe rred to the Langley\nResearch Center. The NASTRAN Systems Management Office (NSMO) was e stablished\nin the Structures Division at Langley October 4, 1970, and the first public\nrelease of NASTRAN was in November 1970.\nThe requirement for centralized management of NASTRAN is dictated by its\nrange of complex system software features and extensive capabilities. As the\nl argest, best documented, user-oriented, general purpose finite-element\ncomputer program for structural analysis, NASTRAN is without a peer in providing capability for the integrated analysis of complete aerospace vehicle\nstructures. Twelve prepackaged "rigid formats" permit the analy3is of one and\nthe same structural model f or a wide variety of static and dynamic loading\nconditions, including buckling, steady state frequency res\xc2\xb7p onse, transient and\nrandom response behavior. NASTRAN consists of over 151,000 Fortran statements\nwhich translate into over 1,000,000 machine language statements. It is\nmachine independent and operates on the IBM 360, CDC 6000 series, and the\nUNNAC 1108 machine. Perhaps the most unique fe ature of NASTRAN is its executive system for data scheduling and overall system control. Briefly, NASTRAN\nis as l arge and complex- in a computer software sense-as the operating systems\nfor the three machines with which it interfaces. It is, in fact, a facility,\nwith complete documentation, whi ch presently is in operation throughout the\nUnited States at over 60 differe nt machine i nstallations, with an estimated\nf amily of users numbering nearly 1,000 persons. The communal aspects of\nNASTRAN are obviously far-reaching.\n\nRole of NSMO\nThe management of NASTRAN is the respons ibility of the NASTRAN Systems\nManagement Office (NSMO). The \xc2\xa3\'unctions of this office span the spectrum of\nNASTRAN act i vit ies from maintenance to research and development.\nSpecifically, these \xc2\xa3\'unct i ons include:\nCentralized Program Deve l opment\n(Advisory Committees )\nCoordinating User Experiences\n(NASTRAN Bulletin)\nSystem Maintenance\n(Error Correct i on and Essent i al Improvements)\nDevelopment and Addition of New Capab ility\nNASTRAN-Focused Research and Development\nSIGNIFICANT M\nILESTONES\nOctober 1970 - September 1971\nWhen NSMO was established in October 1970, there exi sted a dire need for\nmaintenance of the NASTRAN system. With the cooperation of Goddard Spa ce\nFlight Center, an interim maintenance contract was negotiated with Computer\nSciences Corporation through a contract in effect at GSFC. This contract\nprovided for the essential function of error correction until a contract for\nfull time maintenance could be negotiated through an open competit i on. The\ninterim maintenance activity was restri cted to the correction of over 75 errors\nreported to NSMO , together with all assoc i ated documentat i on changes . New\nthermal bending and hydroelast i c elements previ ous l y deve l oped by the MacNealSchwendler Corporation under contract to GSFC were a lso i nstalled. Levels 13\nand 14 were created for government test i ng and evalvation. The next vers i on of\nNASTRAN to be relea sed to the publi c through COSMIC* will be built upon the\nresults of this i nterim maintenance act ivity and wi ll be des i gnated Level 15.\nI n June, a contract for full time maintenance of NASTRAN was awarded to\nthe MacNeal-Schwendler Corporat i on. An offsite offic e near the Langley\nResearch Center has been opened by MacNeal-Schwendler, and work on many items\nof maintenance and development has commenced.\nIn addition to the mai ntenance contract, a contract for the development of\nnew elements and a thermal analyzer capability was awarded i n June t o the Bell\nAerospace Company.\n*Computer Software Management Information Center , Barrow Hall,\nUniversity of Georgi a, Athens, 30601 .\n2\n\nAdditional milestone accomplishments include holding the First Annual\nNASA NASTRAN Users\' Colloquium at the Langley Research Center, September 13-15,\n1971, and publishing in August of Vol. 1, No. 1, of the NASTRAN Users\'\nBulleti n-a bimonthly publication of interest . to the family of NASTRAN users.\nMAINTENANCE\nFor the purpose of the present discussion, maintenance is defined to\ninclude error correction i n both the NASTRAN code and documentation, support\nof all ut i lity routines such as the linkage editor and conversion routines,\nand enhancements to the NASTRAN execut i ve and matrix routines which will result\nin increased speed, effi ciency, and convenience of operation. Maintenance i s\na systems r ather than a new capab i lity or element- oriented activity.\nUt i l i ty Routines\nRouti nes for creating new levels of NASTRAN as well as routines for\nconverting NASTRAN from the CDC 6000 series (parent machine) to versions that\nwill run on the I BM 360 and UNIVAC 1108 must be constantly updated as new or\nmodi fied comp i lers and operating systems become available for any of the three\nNASTRAN machi nes. Automat i c update rout i nes are requi red to i mplement a patch\nto a given level. For example, a patch is presently available from COSMI C to\nupdate Level 12.0 to 12 .1. The update routines are required to enable NASTRAN\nusers to incorporate error correct i ons, supplied by the maintenance contractor,\nin a timely fashion.\nError Correction\nError correcti on is perhaps the s i ngle most important maintenance activity.\nErrors i n ei ther the code or the manual s for the standard level of NASTRAN are\nr eported to NSMO, together wi th card decks and annotated output for evaluat i on\nand pri or i ty ass i gnment. The mai nten ance contractor then di agnoses, i solates,\nand corrects the error and further validates the fix with appropriate demonstration runs. When ful l y corrected and vali dated, the correction card deck,\ntogether with card decks for other corrected errors, is made available by NSMO\nas a patch to the current level of NASTRAN. By faithfully reporting known and\nsuspected errors, each member of the NASTRAN fami ly of users benefits both\nhimself and potentially many others. A constantly updated computerized data\nbank of all known NASTRAN bugs will be estab lished by the maintenance\ncontractor for NSMO. A sor t may be per formed at any time by rigid format,\nmodul e, or some other s i gnifi cant system parameter to determine the status of\na previous l y reported bug t o determi ne the nature of any uncorrected bugs in a\nroutine of i nterest . Thi s coor dinated, mutually beneficial, centralized error\ncorrection act i vi ty should result in a relatively trouble-free operation for\nNASTRAN users.\n\n3\n\nEnhancements for Efficiency\nSeveral systems modifications to obtain greater operational speed and\nefficiency are presently in progress. These enhancements include:\nSubstructuring capability to allow the solution of larger\nproblems than is presently practical.\nImproved multiply/add (MPYAD) routines to reduce running time.\nUser-specified single precision for the CDC machine.\nMuch faster general input/output (GINO) routines.\nMore efficient matrix packing routines.\nIt is anticipated that these and other system improvements will decrease\naverage run times for the next public release of NASTRAN (Level 15) by\napproximately a factor of three.\nDummy Element\n\nA user-oriented dummy element capability is under development by the\nmaintenance contractor. This important convenience will allow the incorporation of the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices for a new element for test,\nevaluation, and use in the NASTRAN environment.\nNASTRAN Users\' Bulletin\nAn important aspect of NASTRAN maintenance is timely communication with\nNASTRAN users concerning important developments and system improvements. The\nNASTRAN Users\' Bulletin is designed to satisfy this requirement. Issued\nbimonthly, it will contain a statement from NSMO, significant user notes, news\nof recently reported bugs, information on the next level to be released, and\nunique applications of NASTRAN.\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF NEW CAPABILITY\nSignificant new capability is under development for NASTRAN in addition to\nthe system-oriented activities of the maintenance contractor. The contract\nwith Bell Aerospace previously alluded to provides for the development of\nseveral new elements and a comprehensive capability for thermal analysis. The\nevaluation and selection of new capability for NASTRAN requires the cooperation\nof NASA Centers, other government agencies, and industry. For example, the\nsystem modifications, new elements, and thermal analyzer capability were\nselected from a prioritized compilation of items supplied by all of the NASA\nCenters. P:n~ference has been given to the highest priority items, although\nsome deviation is necessitated to achieve the greatest capability within a\n\n4\n\ngiven cost constraint. The following selected list of new element capability\nis under development with public release planned for early 1973:\nNonprismatic Beam Element\nTriangular and Trapezoidal Cross-Section Rings with Nonaxisymroetric\nDeformation\nGeneral Element defined by stiffness matrix\nMultilayered Triangular and Quadrilateral Plate Elements\nTriangular and Quadrilateral Shell Elements\nRigid Body Element\nTriangular and Q;uadrilateral Plates with Membrane/Flexure\nCoupling\nCurved Beam Element\nHigher Order Shell of Revolution Element for Nonaxisymmetric\nloading\nHigher Order Triangular and Quadrilateral Plate Elements\nIn addition , the following heat transfer capability is also planned:\nTransient and steady-state conduction, convection and radiation with automatic\nconversion of the temperature history to displacement and stress history.\nNo attempt has been made to include with the new capability discussed\nabove numerous other act i vities at other NASA centers or within industry\nitself. Various nonstandard experimental or parochial versions of NASTRAN\nexist. When new capability tested in an experimental NASTRAN environment is\nfound to be a valuable addition to the standard level of NASTRAN, it will be\nincorporated by NSMO.\nFUTURE LEVELS OF NASTRAN\nNew levels of NASTRAN will be released when the number of error correction\npatches, system improvements, and new elements becomes excessive and dictates\nthe generation of a complete new level. Ease and s i mplicity of bookkeeping and\nlocal management are prime drivers in this situation. Although no firm\ncommitment i s possible, it is anticipated that future releases of NASTRAN will\noccur and will include new capabil ity general ly somewhat as follows:\n\n5\n\n1972\n\nLevel 15\nError Corrections\nSub structuring\nEnhancements for speed:\nGINO\nMPYAD\n\nSingle Optional Precision (Limited)\nMatrix Packing\nDummy Element\n\nThermal Analyzer\n(Steady State Conduction)\n\n1973\n\nLevel 16\nError Corrections\nComplete Single Precision\nNew Elements Developed By\nBell Aerospace\nComplete Thermal Analyzer\n\nLater levels will include incremental additions to the comprehensive\ncapability if this activity receives funding support.\nSUMMA.RY\nThe maintenance and development of NASTRAN has been centralized at the\nLangley Research Center in the NASTRAN Systems Management Office (NSMO ).\nSeveral important system improvements are i n progress which will result in a\nsignificant reduction of average computer run t ime. The maintenance\ncontractor, MacNeal-Schwendler, is also engaged in the addition of comprehensive substructuring capability. A dummy element capability which allows the\ntest, evaluation, checkout, and temporary use of a new element in the NASTRAN\nenvironment is also underway and planned for i nclusio n in Level 15.\nSeveral new elements and a comprehensive heat transfer capability are in\ndevelopment under a contract with the Bell Aerospace Company. These\nenhancements are planned for inclusion in Level 16.\n\n6\n\nIn summary, NASTRAN has emerged as a powerful , generalized facility for\nthe analys i s of compl ex aerospace structures and is r api dly gai ni ng acceptance\nfrom the community of aerospace and industrial users. NASA i s , therefore,\ncommitted to manage and mai ntain the NASTRAN system as a valuable nat ional\nresource.\n\n7\n\nCALCULATION OF STRESS CONCENTRATION DUE TO A HYPERBOLOID\nCAVITY IN A THIN PLATE USING NASTRAN\nBy Phillip R. Wilcox\nNASA Ames Research Center\nSUMMARY\nNASTRAN has been used to solve for the stress concentration in a\nplate due to a hyperboloid cavity under biaxial loading. Details concerning the usage of the program, modeling of the structure, and a comparison between experimental and theoretical results are presented.\nINTRODUCTION\nAt the time NASTRAN was released to Ames Research Center, an experimental program was underway to determine the stress concentration caused\nby the presence of a surface cavity in a plate under uniform biaxial\ntension. Both hyperboloid and hemispherical cavities were then analyzed\nwith NASTRAN, and the comparison with experimental and other theoretical\nwork was presented in reference 1. However, since this work represents\na good example of the application of NASTRAN to three dimensional problems,\ndetails concerning the usage of the program and results for one cavity\nshape are given herein.\nSYMBOLS\n\na\n\nradius of cavity at surface of plate\n\nd\n\nplate thickness\n\nh\n\ncavity depth\n\nK\n\nstress concentration factor at bottom of cavity\n\np\n\napplied radial pressure\n\nr\n\nradial coordinate\n\nz\n\naxial coordinate\n\n9\n\nradial stress component tangent to surface\ncircumferential stress component\nPROGRAM INPUT AND OUTPUT\nLevel 11.1 .0 rigid format series 1, adapted to the I.B.M. 360-67\nwas used in the analysis. The cavity s hape that will be discussed here\nis a 1.047-radian hyperboloid cavity and is shown in Figure 1.\nTrapezoidal and triangular ring elements were used in the analysis\nwithin the limitation of the program. NASTRAN requires, using the\nnotation in Figure 2:\n1. r ~ 0 for Gl & G4 of the trapezoidal element\n2. r > 0 for G2 & G3 of the trapezoidal element\n3. r > 0 for Gl, G2, & G3 of the triangular element\n4. if r = O, the grid point must be restrained because of symmetry\nin all but the z direction, i.e. 12456\n5. if r # O, the grid point restraints are 2456\nThe program outputs were:\n1. displacements of all grid points\n(a) radial (b) axial\n2. stresses for all elements (a) radial (b) circumferential\n(c) axial (d) shear\n3. nodal forces at all grid points (a) radial (b) circumferential\n(c) axial\n4 . load vectors\nThe trapezoidal stress outputs were for the 4 grid points and centroid,\nwhile the triangular stress outputs were for the centroid only.\nThe plate was first modeled with 413 elements with 804 degrees of\nfreedom as shown in Figure 3(a) and (b). Smaller elements, Figure 3(c),\nsubsequently were used in the neighborhood of the cavity to avoid the\nlarge discontinuity in stresses for the same grid point of four adjoining\nelements as shown for the coarse grid in Figure 4. This continuity in the\nstresses implied that we had arrived at a reasonable size for the elements.\nThis refinement increased the model to 497 elements wi th 948 degrees of\nfreedom. To vary the ratio of cavity depth to plate thickness (h/d)\nelements were either added or removed from the back surface of the plate.\nIn all there were six different model configurations run. These\nconfigurations are listed in Table I. The largest one was for a h/d = .25\nwhich had 1,033 elements with 1930 degrees of freedom and required 1151\ninput cards .\nA compressive load equal to 6.895 x 10 6 N/m 2 (1000 psi) was applied\nthrough the grid points at the edge of the plate. The method used to\n\n10\n\ncalculate the load vector is illustrated in Figure 5 and summarized as\nfollows:\nUniform load= Pressure *2nr\nLoad vector = Uniform load *6z\nexcept for the edge grid points, for which\nLoad vector = Uniform load *6 z\n\n2\nCOMPARISON OF NASTRAN SOLUTIONS WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND ANALYTICAL RESULTS\nFigure 6 shows the comparison between the experimental and computer\nsolution of the cavity surface and back surface stresses for h/d = .51.\nThe experimental stress concentration factors at the bottom of the cavity\nwere within 4% of that calculated by NASTRAN based on two experimental\nplates. NASTRAN was also compared with the analytical work that R. A.\nEubanks did in 1954 for a hemispherical cavity in a semi-infinite solid\n(ref. 2). The stress concentration factor, K, calculated by Eubanks was\n2.23 and that obtained from NASTRAN 2.3. Here again the stress concentration factor was within 4%. Since the agreement was so good, the rest\nof the experimental program was cancelled and the desired quantities\nobtained using NASTRAN.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe results obtained here indicate that ac.c urate values of stresses\ncan be obtained for three-dimensional axisymmetric problems even in regions\nwhere the stresses are rapidly varying. Of course as the stress gradient\nincreases the grid size must be decreased to maintain the same accuracy,\nbut the use of variable size elements allows one to confine the small\ngrid size to the region of rapidly varying stresses.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nReed, Robert E.

Bar c lay, Stuart L . Hanlein,\nJohn Sween, Jr . and Paul H. King\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nNASTRAN, NASA\'s finite-element structural analysis computer program, was used\nto calculate lateral deflections of a very weak spacecraft antenna boom, essentially a\nvertically-hung cantilever beam, under laboratory loading. The non-linear effect of\ngravity was included.\nThe purpose of the test was to determine the boom stiffness at extremely small\nstrains thus simulating the strain conditions produced by dynamic lateral deflections in\norbit.\nThe calculated deflections indicate that the determination should be possible; however, large hysteresis effects were found to be present and no stiffness results have\nbeen obtained in time for inclusion by publication date.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn July 4, 1968, the Radio Astronomy Explorer satellite was launched. Its principal\nradio astronomy antennas and principal structural feature consist of four 22 8.6-meter\n(750 feet) tubular booms in an " X\' \' configuration. Each boom was formed of beryllium\ncopper tape which had been prestressed to curl lenghwise into a tube. For storage the\ntape was forced flat and wound onto its drum. In orbit, the tape is dispensed from the\nstorage drum whereupon it -immediately assumes its tubular shape. There is a seam\nrunning the length of each boom which contains interlocking teeth to limit overlapping\nand so improve torsional rigidity.\nThe " RAE" spacecraft is " gravity-gradient" stabilized which means that it orbits\nthe earth always "pointing" toward the center of the earth. This result is caused by the\nfact that on the near-earth side of the spacecraft\'s center-of-gravity orbit the pull of\ngravity on the spacecraft structure is larger than the centrifugal reaction force. The\nreverse is true outside the center of gravity where the centrifugal reaction is larger\n\n17\n\nthan the gravity force. These forces acting on the spacecraft tend to pull it into the\nearth-center-pointing attitude. Disturbances can cause rocking, i.e., librating, about\nthis attitude.\nAfter the spacecraft was fully deployed in orbit it was soon noticed that the observed libration frequencies were lower than calculated. Because the libration motion\nalso causes a bending action in the booms , boom stiffness affects the libration frequency.\nFrom this it was postulated that the booms might be less stiff in orbit than had been\nmeasured in the laboratory where larger-than-orbit strain conditions were present. In\nother words, the low-strain stiffness might be different (possibly lower) than the stiffness measured at higher strains due to the overlapping, tab-meshing construction of the\nbooms.\nThe main difficulty in a low-strain measurement is that the gravity load is much\nlarger than the required low- strain loading.\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nNASTRAN rotation about axis perpendicular to x-y plane\nNASTRAN displacement in x direction\nNASTRAN displacement in y direction\nE\n\nYoung\'s modulus\n\nEI\n\nstiffness\n\nI\n\ncross section moment of inertia\n\nX\n\nNASTRAN x axis (longitudinal boom axis)\n\ny\xc2\xb7\n\nNASTRAN y axis (transverse boom axis)\n\nTEST METHOD\n\nThe boom was mounted as a cantilever beam in a vertical position with the fixed\nend at the top. (See Figure l.) Loading was produced by attaching a thin stick of balsa\nwood at the free end perpendicular to the boom. A small weight was hung on the balsa\nstick thus producing a moment and a downward force.\n\n18\n\nThis technique of loading was chosen so as to produce deflection with a large, and\nsomewhat uniform radius of curvature along the boom.\n\nNASTRAN CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBecause the gravity forces on the boom are large as compared with the applied load\nit was necessary to consider their effect even for very small deflections. For this purpose the NONLINEAR provision of NASTRAN was used. The R 3 quantity multiplied by\nthe segment weight yields (for small angles) the bending moment produced by gravity as\nthe boom moves out of the vertical position.\nUsing the NONLINEAR provision requires the use of rigid format 9, Direct\nTransient Response. In order to reduce the time required to reach steady state,\ndampers were attached at the grid points and the load was applied gradually. See Figure 2 for NASTRAN input.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 3 shows the NASTRAN-calculated deflections.\nFigure 4 plots stiffness against tip deflection.\nDuring laboratory testing, the unloaded shape of the boom was found not to be\nstraight and changed when the boom was twisted ever so slightly. This effect may be\nimportant in explaining the in-orbit dynamic behaviour.\nA loading sequence was carried out in which the boom returned to the unloaded\nshape after the l oad was removed. Hopefully, this data can eventually be made to yield\na stiffness determination. However, since the test involved a starting shape that was\nnot straight, a different length, and a different load, da:ta reduction has not been completed at this time.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nLarge inelastic effects and non- straight conditions exist in this boom material.\n\n19\n\nFUTURE RE SEARCH\n\nUsing relatively long lengths and precision measuring techniques it should be possible to measure some of these unusual properties of the boom material.\n\n20\n\n~ \\ ----~YAXIS(T 2 )\n\nl~ORIGINATEND OF CANTILEVER\nBUILT-IN\n1\n1\n\n~\n\nI ,___\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nGRID POINTS\nWITH GRAVITY FORCE ACTING\n(ACTUALLY 15 POINTS)\nBOOM UNDER TEST\n\nTRANSVERSE GRAVITY COMPONENT=\nGRAVITY FORCE x R3 (SMALL ANGLE THEORY)\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nLONGITUDINAL GRAVITY COMPONENT\nNEGLIGIBLE BENDING EFFECT\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nANGLE--,-\xc2\xb7\\\nR3\n\nI\n\n,\n\nI\n\n..,.)\n\nl....- ......\n\n-\n\n\\. \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nTEST\nLOADING\n\nt\n\nX AXIS (T1 )\n(VERTICAL IN LABORATORY TEST)\n\nFigure 1 \xe2\x80\xa2 Loading Schematic.\n\n21\n\nN\n\nl .J\n\nAPP\n\nA\n\n5\n\nT h:\n\n;,,.\n\nr.\n\ni~\n\nX .::.\n\n....\n\n~\n\nT\n\nV E\n\nC\n\nccr-.TRGL\n\nc:\n\nC K\n\nCJ C TO d ER:\n\n1 \'i 7 0\n\nHAt-<C LnY , i< A L.L.

Viall\nTeledyne Brown Engineering\nHuntsville, Alabama\nSUMMARY\nApollo Telescope Mount (ATM) and Orbital Workshop Stage (OWS)\nstress analysis models are discussed relative to why and how NASTRAN\nwas used. The models discussed are for Rigid Format (SOL 1, 0) type\nanalyses of space frames, stiffened cylinders, complex stiffened bulkheads, and simple panels with complex loading.\nThe discussions show that NASTRAN has many features that simplify\nrigid format static analyses. These features include grid-point sequencing,\nmultiple coordinate systems, user master files, restart, bar-offset vectors,\nsufficient element catalog, and boundary condition options.\nThe quality and timeliness of stress analyses performed on Skylab\nhardware at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) would not be possible\nwith the current program library except for NASTRAN.\nINTRO DUG TION\nThis paper discusses some of the Skylab I flight hardware stress\nanalysis models and states how and why NASTRAN was used in .their ana;iyses.\nThe discussions briefly describe the hardware and models used, but no\nattempt is made to cover the modelJ.ng details, NASTRAN input, NASTRAN\noutput , or quality of analysis. Reasons for using NASTRAN in lieu of other\ndisplacement method programs are stated; these reasons include both\noperational and analytical considerations. Operational considerations\ninclude ease of manipulating models, loads, and sequencing within\nNASTRAN, while analytical considerations include element selection,\nboundary conditions, and modeling geometry.\nThe plots included for the models discussed show general configuration,\ncomplexity, and boundary conditions .\n\n27\n\nModels considered for the Apollo Telescope Mount are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nATM Rack Model\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nATM Canister Sun End Bulkhead Models\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nATM Cable Tray Model\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nATM Components Test Panel Models.\n\nModels considered for the Orbital Workshop Stage are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTank Wall Edge-Weld Model\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTank Wall Center-Weld Model.\n\nThe models discussed in this paper are limited to static analysis using\nthe NASTRAN rigid format SOL 1, 0. The hardware configuration includes\nmany types of structures such as space frame, skin stringer, torque box,\nhoneycomb panels, and complex stiffened bulkheads.\nAPOLLO TELESCOPE MOUNT RACK MODEL\nThe ATM Rack (Figure 1) is an octagonal space frame with shear panels.\nThe primary structure is the upper and lower octagonal rings and the eight\nvertical beams connecting the rings. During flight and some handling\nconditions the rack is supported by four sets of four- bar outriggers that\nintersect at nodes 13, 14, 15, and 16. During transportation the rack is\nsupported by the Solar Array Support Ring which is below the lower ring.\nThe Solar Array Support Ring is attached to the vertical beam extension\nbelow the lower ring and is braced to the lower ring by diagonal bracing.\nTwo intercostals are located in each of the four outrigger bays and attach to\nthe vertical beams. Four diagonal braces are located in the non-outrigger\nbays, and they attach to the upper and lower rings at alternate vertical beam\nattach points. Equipment panels that act as shear panels are located in each\nof the eight vertical bays and either fill, or partially fill, these bays. These\npanels are either attached to the flanges or to the webs of the vertical beams,\nas well as to the inte rcostals. Gyro support structure is located in three of\nthe four outrigger bays in the upper half of the vertical bay.\nThe rack was de signed for flight and orbital loads. Evaluation of orbital\nloads showed them to be non-critical, so they have since been excluded.\nThe flight design loads were:\n\n1.\n2.\n\n28\n\nSaturnIB lift-off with 95 percent ground wind (10 cases)\nSaturn V lift-off with 95 percent ground wind (1 case)\n\n3.\n\nSaturn V maximum acceleration (10 cases)\n\n4.\n\nSaturn V separation and cutoff ( 1 case)\n\n5.\n\nS-II separation and cutoff (not critical)\n\n6. Saturn V max q-a (not critical).\nAdditional loads applied to the rack were transportation (4 cases),\nhandling and erection (5 cases), and test (11 cases). These load conditions\nwere not to impact the design, but they had to be considered during analysis.\nA total of 42 different load cases was applied to the rack model; 31 of\nthese cases (all except for test load cases) were run with the rack dead\nload times some load factor. To simplify reanalysis when the loads (dead\nload and load factors) changed, six unit load cases were defined:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThree one-G loads in three mutually perpendicular directions\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThree one-a loads in three mutually perpendicular directions.\n\nThe ATM Rack model has been run in a multitude of configurations with\nrespect to boundary conditions. For the flight cases the rack was supported\nat each outrigger by three bars that simulated the spring rates of the support\nstructure, and for the transportation cases the rack was rigidly supported\nat the Solar Array Support Ring. For the handling and erection cases the\nrack was placed in the proper orientation, and the handling and erection\nequipment was modeled and added to the rack model.\nThe ATM Rack model has been developed by continually refining the\nlatest model to suit the current analysis requirements. All the structural\ncomponents cited above are included _ lus the simulated solar panels\np\nsupport frames in the folded position, simulated ATM canister and canister\nsupport structure, simulated gyros, and handling equipment for handling\nload cases only.\nThe current rack model runs in 29. 6 min with 28 load cases and has\n245 nodes, 590 bars, 28 rods, 20 triangles, 8 shear panels, and 16\n\nquadrilaterals.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe addition and scalar multiplier capability of the LOAD card\nallowed the use of six unit loadings from which loads for any\ncombination of load direction and load factors could be obtained.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe User Master File (UMF) capability allows the major portion of\nthe bulk data deck (3000 cards) to remain at the computer facility\non tape, so only a small UMF modification and case control deck\nwas required.\n\n29\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe restart capability of NAST RAN allows storage of inverted\nstiffness matrices for each type boundary condition. This saved\n20 min per run and permitted timely recycling of analysis\nfor revision to the loading conditions. The recycling required\napproximately 1 min per load case .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe ATM Rack load paths do not all intersect at member centroids.\nThe offset vector allows the inclusion of these eccentricities without\nthe use of additional nodes. Approximately 60 bars were offset which\nresulted in a saving of 120 nodes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAnalysis of the ATM Rack for handling loads with handling fixtures\nincluded in the model showed that the first set of fixtures was\nunstable. Modifications to the fixtures still produced a mathematically\nunstable stiffness matrix but the use of SUPPORT boundary constraints\nprovided the necessary constraints to the fixtures which acted as a\nmechanism .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe grid sequencing allowed optimization \xc2\xb7of run time and continual\nupdating and refining of the model.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMaterial allowable input and Margin of Safety calculations considerably\nreduced the engineering man hours required for the complete analysis .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe multiple coordinate system capability allowed the rack-tohandling fixture and rack-to-simulated solar array panel orientations to be varied to define the highest stress levels. The capability also allowed this structure to be modeled in its own coordinate\nsystem.\n\nThe ATM Rack test results for transportation load cases agreed well\nwith the analysis results. At the time this paper was written the flight tests\nwere in progress and preliminary data evaluations indicate that analysis\nstresses are slightly higher than test data. The analytical displacements\nwere much lower than predicted, since the outrigger support structure used\nfor the test is much softer than that used in the model.\nAPOLLO TELESCOPE MOUNT CANISTER SUN END BULKHEAD MODELS The ATM Sun End Bulkhead is a machined, integrally stiffened, circular\naluminum bulkhead that acts as a mounting surface for electronic packages\nwhile in a low pressure environment. A stiffened fiber glass sun shield is\nattached to the aluminum bulkhead by fiber glass support posts which are\n\n30\n\n2 in. long and are bonded to both the bulkhead and sun shield with Epon\nEpoxy bond. The bulkhead is attached to the experiment package canister\nwhich is a longitudinally stiffened circular cylinder. The bulkhead design\nis based on the following three load conditions:\n\n1.\n\nGround Purge ultimate pressure (0. 625 psi)\n\n2.\n\nFlight lift-off acceleration loads (-4. 7 G)\n\n3.\n\nFlight cutoff acceleration loads (3. 5 G).\n\nSince the fiber glass sun shield was not available at the time the tests\nwere scheduled, a structural qualification test was performed on an\nexperiment package without the sun shield attached to the bulkhead. The\ntests structurally qualified the bulkhead, but deformations of the bulkhead\nindicate that the sun shield support posts might become overstressed at the\nbonded joints.\nTwo models were planned for the analysis. The first model was the full\naluminum bulkhead with test loads. The results of this model were compared\nwith test data. The second model was the same as the first model with the\nfull sun shield added and with design loads applied. This model was too large\nfor optimum turnaround time, so a third model was used which was one-half\nthe second model with appropriate boundary conditions applied to the cut\nsection. All three models had a portion of the longitudinal stiffened canister\nincluded to provide proper bulkhead boundary conditions.\nThe basic description of the three models follows:\n\n1.\n\nFull Bulkhead Model (Figure 2). This model was supported at the\nlower end of the simulated canister. Figure 2 shows the vertical\nstiffeners but omits the vertical panels for clarity. The supports\nwere applied in the plane of nodes 234, 239, 243, 247, 251, 255,\n260, and 264. Figure 3 shows a top view of the bulkhead model.\nThe three design conditions stated above were applied fo this model.\nThis model runs in 16. 0 min for 3 load cases and has 267 nodes,\n383 bars, 469 triangles, arid 67 quadrilaterals.\n\n2.\n\nFull Bulkhead Model with Sun Shield (Figure 4). This model has\n475 nodes, 563 bars, 668 triangles, and 155 quadrilaterals. It was\nnot run because of the long anticipated run time.\n\n3.\n\nBulkhead with Sun Shield Half Model. This model has the three\nload conditions stated above and 245 nodes, 300 bars, 297 triangles, and 80 quadrilaterals. At the time this paper was being\nprepared it had not been run.\n\n31\n\nNASTRAN was used to analyze the canister bulkhead for the following\nrea\xc2\xb7sons:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe grid sequencing capability of NASTRAN allowed the development\nof the bulkhead model followed by the addition of the sun shield with the\nfinal model optimized for run time.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMaterial allowable input and Margin of Safety calculation capabilities\nreduced the amount of hand stress analysis required to perform the\ntotal analysis of the bulkhead.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBar-offset vectors allow all eccentric stiffeners to be properly\nlocated and their effect on bending of the bulkhead properly included\nin the analysis.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe complex stress .p atterns inherent in the bulkhead caused by the\ncutouts, stiffeners, and normal loads are better approximated with\nthe plate-bending capabilities of the NASTRAN elements.\n\nThe stress and deflection results of the canister Sun End Bulkhead\nanalysis were very close to test results for the model without the sun shield.\nAt the time this paper was written the results of the one-half bulkhead with\nsun shield attached were not available for comment.\nAPOLLO TELESCOPE MOUNT CABLE TRAY MODEL\nThe ATM Cable Tray {Figure 5) is a stringer-stiffened, torque-box type\nstructure that supports all cable and wiring running from the ATM Rack to\nthe experiment canister. The cable tray design is based on four flight and\nfour transportation load conditions which are combinations of vibration and\ndynamic load factors. The Cable Tray is supported by hinges on both sides\nof the forked end and is fixed to a rotating drum at the other end with a hinge\nin the plane of the tray.\nThe cable tray NASTRAN model consists of 170 nodes with 66 bars,\n10 triangles, and 100 quadrilaterals. The model runs on the UNIVAC 1108\nin 9. 0 min for 8 load cases. The matrix has a B equal to 158, a C equal to\n0, and decomposes in 146 sec.\nThe cable tray is loaded so that it experiences high bending and torsional\nloads. The boundary conditions and loading are such that the tray exhibits\nlarge differential displacements.\nNASTRAN was used to analyze the cable tray for the following reasons:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n32\n\nDisplacements had to be determined to define clearance problems,\nand NASTRAN would allow the application of accurate boundary\n\nconditions on the cable tray and drum and a gross simulation of the\nvery stiff drum with multipoint constraints.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe high redundancy of stringer-stiffened, torque-box construction\nand the odd cable tray configuration required that plate bending of the\nbox panels be considered to determine displacements accurately.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLoad distribution at discontinuities in the cable tray load paths were\nmore realistic with plate-bending and bar-stiffener elements than\nwith the standard shear panel modeling techniques used for analysis\nof torque boxes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLoad distribution at discontinuities in the cable tray load paths were\nmore realistic with plate-bending and bar-stiffener elements than\nwith the standard shear panel modeling techniques used for analysis\nof torque boxes.\n\nThe NASTRAN cable tray stress and stiffness analysis proved to be\nvalid during the cable tray structural test program.\nAPOLLO TELESCOPE MOUNT COMPONENTS TEST PANEL MODELS\nThe ATM Equipment Panels are either honeycomb sandwich or sheet\nstringer panel type structures that carry equipment packages, power\nsupplies, and electronic "black boxes" in support of the ATM experiments.\nThe panels are supported by the ATM Rack vertical beam webs and flanges.\nThe panel attachments are continuous supports along three edges.\nBasic flight, transportation, and erection and handling loads analyses\nwere performed on these panels using the ATM Rack Model, but test loads\nanalyses and predictions were performed on separate and more detailed\nmodels. Accurate data predictions and definition of all possible high stress\npoints for the test loads were necessary, since the panels were attached\nto the 4-S ATM hardware and panel failure during the panel tests would have\ncaused considerable delay in the total ATM test program.\nThree component panels were modeled:\n\n1.\n\nThe Honeycomb Quarter Panel Model (Figure 6) was supported along\nthe sides and upper edge. It was loaded at the load fixture attach\npoints with the test load that simulates the worst combination of\nvibration and dynamic load factors defined by previous analyses.\nThe model runs on the UNIVAC 1108 in 9. 5 min for 1 load case and\nhas 281 nodes, 27 triangles, and 208 quadrilaterals.\n\n33\n\n2.\n\nThe Honeycomb Full Panel Model ( Figure 7) was supported along the\nsides and upper edge. The model runs in 9. 0 min for 1 load case\nand has 292 nodes, 61 triangles, and 214 quadrilateral panels.\n\n3.\n\nThe Skin-stringer Full Panel Model was supported along the sides\nand upper edge. The model has 2 73 nodes, 54 triangles, and 162\nquadrilateral panels.\n\nNASTRAN was used to analyze the components test panels for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe components\ndetail to provide\nmodels were the\nMSFC computer\n\ntest panels had to be modeled with considerable\na fine stress pattern for the test loads. The resultinf\noptimum size to obtain quick turnaround through the\nfacility.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe CQUADl element available in the NASTRAN element library is\nan absolute idealization of the honeycomb panels.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe plate-bending capability of the CQUADl element was necessary\nsince the major test panel loads were out of plane.\n\nThe NASTRAN analyses used on these panels have been used to predict\nstrain gage and displacement data for the test loads. At the time this paper\nwas being prepared the Components Panel Tests had not been performed,\nand correlation with test data was not possible.\nORBITAL WORKSHOP STAGE TANK WALL\nThe Orbital Workshop Stage (OWS) tank wall is an integrally milled,\n45\xc2\xb0 waffle-stiffened tank of 660. 4 cm (260 in.) diameter. It is an S-IVB\nstage with the following structural modifications: addition of two floors, two\nscientific airlocks, an astronaut window, and an access door. The floors\nare suspended by a truncated cone that attaches at the upper end to the wall\nat the stiffener intersections and at the lower end to the outside fl o or ring .\nThe floors are an isogrid beam system with isogrid grating attached.\nThe scientific airlocks are used to pass experiments through the tank\nwall; they have a 21. 29 cm (8. 38 in.) by 21. 29 cm (8. 38 in.) opening.\nThe astronaut window is a double-paned window with a diameter of\n45. 72 cm ( 18 in.). The window fits into a frame which, in turn, fits into a\nhole with a 46. 53 cm (18. 32 in.) diameter in the tank wall.\nThe access door is a 145.14 cm (57.14 in.) by 103. 23 cm (40. 64 in.)\nopening with semicircles at top and bottom; the semicircles have a diamete r\n\nof 103. 23 cm (40. 64 in.). The access door bolts to a frame which fits in a\n146. 41 cm (57. 64 in.) by 104. 50 cm (41.14 in.) hole in the tank wall.\nThe OWS tank is composed of 7 similar 682. 50 cm (_268. 7 in,) by\n296 . 42 cm (116. 7 in.) panels rolled to a 330 . 20 cm (130. 0 in.) radius\nand welded longitudinally along the long edges to form the circular tank. The\npanels vary structurally for the four holes specified above. The forward\nand aft ends of the tank are welded to Y-rings which are also attached to\nbulkheads and skirts.\nThe OWS tank design conditions are max q-a and ground wind load\ncases. At max q-a the tank is pressurized, has axial, shear, and bending\nmoment loads applied to the top of the tank, and tank gravitational dead\nloads. For the ground wind load case, the access door is removed, and\nthe tank is unpressurized, has axial, shear, and bending moments applied\nto the top of the tank, and the tank dead loads are in a 1-G environment.\nThe floor loads portion of the OWS tank dead loads are not uniformly\ndistributed around the circumference. The two design conditions must be\nsatisfied at any point around the circumference of the tank.\nTwo general types of ;models were developed for this analysis. The\nfirst type of model, called the Edge-Weld Model (Figure 8), is a model of\none-seventh of the tank with one-half of the welds on the edges of the model\nThis basic Edge-Weld Model has 600 nodes, 801 bars, 180 triangles,\n411 quadrilaterals, and runs in 58 min for 4 load cases. This model was\nplaced on a User Master File (UMF) and modified for the three panels with\ntank wall penetrations. These three models are the scientific airlock\nmodel, the astronaut window model, and the access door with scientific\nairlock model.\nThe second type model, called the Center-Weld Model (Figure 9) is a\nmodel of one-seventh of the tank with the weld located at the center of the\nmodel. The basic Center-Weld Model has 536 nodes , 801 bars, 222 triangles,\n349 quadrilaterals, and runs in 52 min with three load cases. This model\nwas also placed on a UMF and modified for the four panels with tank wall\npenetrations. These models are the right side astronaut window model,\nleft side astronaut window model, right side access door model, and left\nside access door model.\nThe models were developed in cylindrical coordinate systems with the\npositive z-axis being in the forward direction at the centerline of the panel\ncurvature.\n\n35\n\nThe tank wall cross section consists of the integrally milled, internally\nstiffened aluminum skin with insulation tiles in the pockets that also cover\nthe stiffening. These insulation tiles are covered with one or more layers of\nfiber glass liner. The internal surface is a very thin layer of gold liner.\nThis composite section is bonded together. The individual pocket panels\nare modeled as plates, and each discrete stiffener is modeled as an offset\nbar. One of the models was used to determine the plate and fiber glass\nliner combined axial and bending stiffness. This combined stiffness did not\naffect the stresses so only the aluminum skih was used for the panel\nproperties.\nBoundary conditions for the max q-a loading were radial and meridional\nrotation and tangential displacement constraints a\xc2\xb5plied to the\nlongitudinal edges of the models. The top edge has the radial displacement\nand radial and tangential rotations fixed. The bottom edge has an imposed\nradial displacement and tangential rotation as well as being fixed in all\nother directions.\nThe boundary conditions for the ground wind load case are the same as\nmax q-a, except the imposed deformations at the bottom edge are removed.\nThe bottom edge imposed radial displacements and tangential rotations\nwere obtained from another program that analyzes shells of revolution. The\ntop edge in reality should have boundary conditions similar to the bottom edge,\nbut these were not applied since the top is the least stressed portion of the\ncylinder.\nThe unsymmetric loading caused by the varying floor loads means that\nthe side boundary conditions are not totally correct; therefore, the stresses\nin bars and panels along the edge of all models are not correct. For this\nreason overlapping models were used in the analysis and only the stresses\nand deformation in the center one-half of the models were used.\nNASTRAN was used for the analysis of the OWS tank wall for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe OWS tank wall analysis required that stresses be determined for\neach pocket and compared with local buckling stress of the pockets\nand general instability buckling stress of the total tank. This was\nobtained by separating the \xc2\xb7loads in the skin and stringers by\nmodeling each stringer discretely. This analysis could not be\nperformed without considerable hand analysis if the offset vector\ncapability of NASTRAN were not available.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBulk data for all variations of each type model were stored on the\nsame UMF. These bulk data included unit loads for pressure body\nloads, and shell gravitational loads. The variable floor loads were\nalso included for each separate model. The LOAD card permitted\nthe combination of these unit load and special loads for any combination of pressure and G loads.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe GRAV card capability allowed a simulated value to be used to\ninclude the change in vehicle bending moment in the longitudinal\ndirection. This silnulated G value was combined with the gravitation\nload factor to obtain a total G value.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe models for the flight-tank configuration are being changed over\nto the test tank configuration by changing the properties on 18\nPBAR, PTRIA2, and PQUAD2 cards per model. This modification\nis simpler for NASTRAN than for other programs available.\n\nThe results of the flight tank analysis showed that the tank was not\noverstressed. The results also showed where the critical high stress points\nwere, and test instrumentation was defined from this analysis. Currently,\nthe test tank models and test loads are being run to predict the test data for\napproximately 1000 channels of data for 9 test conditions and 2 load points\nper test condition.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis survey of some of the analyses performed on Skylab I hardware\nshows that NASTRAN has the capability to analyze many different types of\nstructure by utilizing the Rigid Format SOL 1, 0 static analysis.\nThe examples presented indicate that considerable detail and versatility\nof analysis is available, thereby reducing both engineering man hours and\ncomputer run time whil e producing a better product.\n\n37\n\nUpper Ring\n\nn\xc2\xb7\niagonal\n\nB race\n\nIntercostals\nLower R.\n1ng\nSun Shield R\xc2\xb7\n1ng\n\nn\xc2\xb7\niagonal\nVertical B earn\n\nFIGURE I.\n\nATM RACK\n\nB racing\n.\n\nFIGURE 2.\n\nATM SUN END BULKHEAD\n\nFIGURE 3.\n\n40\n\nATM SUN END BULKHEAD--TOP VIEW\n\n.\n\n-,,; ,\n\n/\n\n?t.\n\n- 0-p,~ - - -~-:>\xe2\x80\xa2- ---- -\n\nFIGURE 4.\n\n?\xe2\x80\xa25\n\nA TM SUN END BULKHEAD WITH SUN SHIELD\n\n/\n1\n\n?11 ._\n~\n\n<i\n\nDrum\n\nNode 1 Free\nto Rotate\n\n4\n\n5\n\n3\n\n--=--2\n\nMultipoint\nConstraints\n\n~H1nge L"\n1ne\n\nNote:\nNodes 1 through 5 and 168 through\n1 71 are the drum support structure .\nNodes 2 through 5, 161, 163, 165,\nand 167 are fixed to the ATM Rack.\n\n167\n165-163\n\n161\n~H1nge L"\n1ne\n\nFIGURE 5.\n\n42\n\nATM CABLE TRAY\n\n~\n\n~\n\n\\/\n\n7\n\nI\n\n"\'\nFIGURE 6.\n\nA T M H ON E YC O M B Q UARTER P ANEL\n\nTop Edge\n\n.,\n\n......\n\n/,\n\nv"\n....\n\n~\n\nJ\n\n2\n\nI/\'~\n\n/,\n\nI\n\nI__\\ J"\'\\\n\n,\n\n\'\\\n\n~\n\n\\/\nI\n\nT\n\nK..\n\nf/11\n,,,\n\nBottom Edge\n\nF I G U R E 7.\n\n44\n\nATM HONEYCOMB FULL PANEL\n\n-~-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n~ --\n\n- - - --\n\n- - - -- - -- --\n\n- - - - - - -- -\n\nCi, Weld\n\n<i, Weld\nPanel Boundary\n\nFloor\nSupport\nCone\n\nBottom Edge\n\nFIGURE 8.\n\nOWS EDGE-WELD MODEL\n\n45\n\nCi, Panel\n\n<r,\n\nPanel\n\nCi, Weld\n\nBar\n\nPanel\nBoundary\n\nFloor\nSupport\nCone\n\nBottom Edge\n\nFIGURE 9,\n\n46\n\nCENTER-WELD MODEL\n\nSOME ASPECTS OF NASTRAN SOLUTION ACCURACY\nby Gernot W. Baggerunacher, Lockheed-California Company\nIntroduction\nVarious aspects of the accuracy of a NASTRAN solution for static and\nstructural stability analysis have been explored by a series of specific\nexamples,and the results have been evaluated.\n\nThe following problems were\n\ninvestigated, using examples for which closed-form solutions were available.\n1.\n\nNumerical accuracy of the static solution using the example of a\ncantilever beam.\n\n2.\n\nAccuracy of column buckling.\n\n3.\n\nHydrostatic buckling of an arch.\n\n4. Plate buckling in compression.\n5.\n\nAccuracy of membrane and plate element elastic properties.\n\nINVESTIGATION OF NA,STRAN SOLUTION CAPABILITIES\nSeveral investigations were made in 1970 on the adequacy, accuracy, and\nlimitations of NASTRAN static analysis solutions.\n\nThe principal results are\n\ndiscussed below.\nLimitation of Solution Accuracy\nIn the displacement method the accuracy of the inte.r nal forces demands a\nvery high numerical accuracy in the displacements.\n\nThe present NASTRAN on the\n\nI:EM 360-91 uses double precision arithmetic to determine displacement, but only\nsingle precision when deriving internal forces.\n\nThe single precision accuracy\n\nof the CDC 6600 system is about twice that of the IlM 360-91.\n\nTo explore the\n\neffect of this numerical precision, a simple cantilever beam, shown in Figure l,\nconsisting of caps, stiffeners, and shear panels, was used.\nThis beam was analyzed for a range of span to depth ratios (b/a), yarying\nthe number of spanwise fields from 50 to 1000 to observe the behavior of numerical accuracy.\n\nExamples were run on the in-house IBM 360-91 system, as well as\n\non a CDC 6600 system through the courtesy of the MacNeal-Schwendler Corp.\ndigital accuracy available in these two machines is shown on Table l.\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\ndeterioration of the solution accuracy with the increase in beam span is shown\nin Table 2.\n\nIt illustrates that the solution of the displacements can be very\n\nsatisfactory, while the corresponding stresses deteriorate earlier.\nb/a\n\nAt\n\n= 100 the shear flow in the tip panel becomes erratic, and is useless\n\nabove\n\nb/a = 200\n\nrect up to\n\nfor the IBM 360-91, while the result on the CDC 6600 is cor-\n\nb/a = 1000.\n\nThis is due to insufficient numerical accuracy of the\n\nI:EM 360-91 single precision in the calculation of element strains from the\nvery high tip deflections of the large-span beam.\n\n48\n\nStatic Stability\nThe capability of NASTRAN rigid format 5 to perform static stability analyses (bi:fu:rcation type) has been investigated by a series of tests.\n\nUsing\n\nproblems for which theoretical closed-form solutions exist permits the determination of the accuracy of the numerical analysis and gives a good indication\nof how related problems, for which no theoretical solution exists, can be\nsolved.\n\nThe conclusions drawn from these buckling analyses apply similarly to\n\nthe corresponding beam-column type solutions.\n(1)\n\nColumn buckling.\n\nComparisons of NASTRAN results with those of the\n\nclassical Euler Column Theory\n\nwere ma.de, using BAR elements to represent the column.\n\nThe errors\n\nwere below 0.1 percent when using five (5) or more BAR elements per\nhalf-wave of the buckling mode.\n\nThis capability, however, does not\n\ninclude torsion-bending failure of open sections.\n(2)\n\nStability of circular arch under hydrostatic pressure.\n\nThe results of\n\na NASTRAN analysis were compared with the closed-form solution\n\n4crit\nin which\nR\n\n= radius\n\n4crit = critical pressure o:f the arch in lb/inch,\nof the arch,\n\nI= moment of inertia\n\nE\n\n= elastic\n\nmodulus, and\n\nof the cross section.\n\nThe results obtained from rigid format 5 were wrong.\n\nThe reason for\n\nthi~ error was that the current version of rigid format 5 of NASTRAN can\nonly analyze the stability of structures under conservative load systems.\n\n49\n\nThat is, the direction of the load vectors is invariant during buckling.\nThis restriction that the load vectors remain invariant during buckling\nexcludes such load situations as hydrostatic pressure, and would cause\nconsiderable error if this rigid format is used as it is.\n\nA solutidn to\n\nthis type of problem was adapted to the NASTRAN stability analysis by\nusing auxiliary matrix instructions (Appendix).\n\nThe numerical solutions\n\nobtained with this modified procedure compared very well with the theoretical values; the error was only 0.2 percent when using 20 BAR elements\nper half-wave length of the buckling mode.\n\n(3)\n\nPlate buckling.\n\nVarious types of plate compression problems were\n\nsolved with NASTRAN and are summarized in Table 3.\nBuckling loads calculated by these methods should, preferably,\nbe consistently higher than theoretical values, by not mo~e than 5 to\n10 percent in the case of crude representation.\n\nThe tabulated results\n\nshow that the analyses of relatively long plates ran into serious\ntrouble .\nness.\n\nThis led to a detailed investigation of plate element stiff-\n\nThe following restri.ctions must be observed in the application\n\nof NASTRAN version 11.1.3 to plate problems:\na)\n\nThe use of NASTRAN QUAD plate elements must be restricted to side\nratios between 1:1 and 1:1.5.\n\nb)\n\nDo not use the TWIST element.\n\nc)\n\nPlate-buckling networks must have a nearly s~uare mesh.\n\nThe structural models as shown in Table\nsimply supported and free boundaries.\n\n3 have various combinations of\n\nThe constraints which were imposed\n\nat the grid points to represent the various types of boundary conditions\nare shown in Figure 2.\n\n50\n\nThe "theoretical solution\n\ncrTH" as li$ted in\n\nTable 3 is the buckling stress evaluated from the appropriate one of the\nfollowing equations:\na)\n\nSquare plate, simply supported along all fou;r edges\n\nb)\n\nRectangular plate, simply supported along bot h compressed ends\nand one side, with the remaining side free\no:\n\nj6 (l\n\n=\n\nTH\n\n[\n\n- v) + b27 rc2D\nrc2\na~\xc2\xb0t)2t\n\nc)\n\nColumn, simply supported at both ends\n\nd)\n\nFlange of angle, simply supported at compressed ends\n0 TH=\n\n~\n\n( 1 - V)\nb2~\n-.....,,....-+- rc2D\nrc2\na2 b 2 t\n\nIn these equations,\n\xc2\xb7 Et3\nl2 ( l - v2) \'\n\nD\n\nrepresents the flexural rigidity of the plate\n\na - length of the plate\n-\n\nt = pl.ate thickness,\n\nb = width of the plate,\n\n\'\n\nv = Poisson\'s ratio, and E = elastic modulus.\n\nQuadrilateral and Triangular Plate Elements\nWhen the plate element QU.Aie was used to investigate plate buckling problems, some of the results were much too high.\n\nThis touched off a series of\n\ninvestigations into the details of the behavior of this element .\n\nSince all\n\nQUAD elements are built up from simple superposition of the TRIA element, these\nelements may haye similar t~oubles.\n\nThus a series of single-element test struc-\n\ntures were set up to evaluate the plate flexibility variation with the plate\naspect ratio.\n\nIn Figure 3 the basic one-element model is shown supported as a\n\n51\n\ncantilever at grid points land\n\n4.\n\nThese test structures were loaded by yarious\n\nsimple unit loads at the free end, and the displacements at these grid points\nwere compared.\n2,\n\nSix different values of aspect ratio\n\na/b\n\nwere evaluated:\n\nl,\n\n4, 8, 16, and 32.\nSame of the important findings presented in Figures 4 through lO are the\n\nfollowing:\n(l)\n\nThe free-end displacements for S<;lllle of the load conditions (Figures 4\nthrough 6) increase monotonicalJ.y as given by the theory.\n(Figures\n\n7 through\n\nFor others\n\nlO), the consistency breaks down rapidly for aspect\n\nratios above l.O; that is, the element becomes too rigid with increased\nlength.\n(2)\n\nThe plate-bending portion of the QUAD element (which is the same as the\nQUPLT element) behaves well for bending and transverse load (Figures 5\nand 6) but deteriorates rapidly for torsion and twist (Figures 7\nand lO).\n\n(3)\n\nThe membrane portion of the QUAD elem,ent is correct over the whole\nrange for constant axial load (Figure\n\n4)\n\nbut too rigid for an in-\n\nplane force-couple (Figures 8 and 9).\n\n(4)\n\nThis irregular behavior of the QUAD2 element demonstrates that\nQUAD2 &. Q,DPLT cannot be used above\n\na/b = l.5\n\nand that QUAD2 &.

ARCH UNDER HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE\n\nA NASTRAN BUCKLING ANALYSIS OF A LARGE STIFFENED\nCYLINDRICAL SHELL WITH A CUTOUT\nBy Richard H. Brolliar\nTeledyne Brown Eng ineering\nHuntsville, Alabama\nSUMMARY\nA buckling analysis of the Skylab Workshop (SWS) cylinder window\nregion is presented. The Skylab Workshop is a waffle - stiffened cylinder\n6.81 m (268 in.) long with a radius of 3.30 m (130 in.). The circular\ncutout in the cylinder for the window is 45.7 cm (18.0 in.) in diameter . The\ncriterion used in deciding how large a portion of the cylinder to model and\nwhat degree of grid refinement to use is explained. Test cases are presented\nwhich show that NASTRAN has the capability to h a ndle cylindrical panel\nbuckling problems if a sufficiently fine grid point pattern is used. The problems encountered in obtaining eigenvalues for large m a trices (up to 2200\ndegrees of freedom) are discussed, and the importance of restraint of rotation\nabout the radial axis at each grid point is explained.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe crew compartment of the SWS is a waffle-stiffened cylinder\n6.81 m (268 in . ) long with a radius of 3.30 cm (130 in.). It was manufactured by modifying a tank of the Saturn V S-IVB stage. A window 45. 7 cm\n(18 in.) in diameter was cut in the cylindrical wall of the waffle-stiffened\ntank. Figure 1 shows the window region of the tank. The window is\ndesigned to be non-load bearing. The basic wall of the SWS is shown in\nFigure 2. It is insulated with polyurethane foam which is covered on the\ninside with a fiber glass and metal foil liner.\nThe SWS cylindrical wall is subjected to axial compressive loads during\nground wind prior to launch and during boost to orbit. The load distribution\nin the window region [s nonuniform, since the load is being sheared around\nthe cutout. This makes the window region a difficult area to analyze for\nbuckling.\n\nInitial buckling analyses of this region were made using the static\nanalysis portion of NASTRAN to determine the average stress level at each\nindividual waffle pocket, including the adjacent stiffeners. The bending\nstiffness of each pocket area around the window was then increased until the\narea showed a positive margin for buckling. In analyzing the pocket for\nbuckling, the pocket and its adjacent stiffeners were imagined to be part of\nan entire cylinder with identical properties which was subjected to the same\nstress level that the individual pocket area experienced. The shell bending\nstiffness was increased where necessary by locally increasing the thickness\nof the fiber glass liner. Although this type analysis approach has been used\nsuccessfully in the past for analyzing cylindrical walls and bulkheads, it is\nquite subjective and could be unconse rvative.\nTherefore, it was decided that, if possible, NASTRAN should be used to\nmake a more exact buckling analysis. In making this decision it was felt\nthat this would be a good problem to use to see how well NASTRAN performed\nfor curved shell buckling problems.\nNAST RAN CYLINDRICAL PANEL BUCKLING TEST CASES\nBefore using NASTRAN for the Skylab problem, it was necessary to\ndetermine if the results obtained would be valid. To do this two groups of\ntest cases were analyzed.\nThe first group was composed of cylindrical panels 34. 11 cm ( 13. 43 in.)\nwide and 170. 6 cm (67. 175 in.) long. The second group was composed of\ncylindrical panels 20. 7 \xc2\xb0 wide and 102. 4 cm (40. 3 in.) long and cylindrical\npanels about 40 \xc2\xb0 wide and 2. 3 9 m ( 94. 0 in.) long. The panels in both groups\nhad a radius of 3. 30 m ( 130. 0 in.), and all were loaded in axial compression.\nThe minimum buckling load for all of the models examined was found by\nusing an eigenvalue starting point considerably below the lowest possible\neigenvalue.\nAxisymmetric Buckling Cases\nFigure 3 shows the four NASTRAN models of the panels in the first\ngroup. These curved panels were modeled using the flat quadrilateral and\ntriangular NASTRAN elements. These models and all those discussed later\nwere modeled in a cylindrical coordinate system, and all of the global\ndegrees of freedom were in cylindrical coordinates. The models were\nsimply supported at the top and bottom and loaded in axial compression. So\nthat only axisymmetric motion would be allowed, all of the grid points were\nconstrained for tangential displacement, rotation about a radial axis, and\nrotation about a longitudinal axis. The first cases analyzed in this group\n\n66\n\nwere monocoque cylinders, identical to those shown in Figure 3, only without the stiffening ribs. These cylinders had skin thicknesses of 0. 312. cm\n(0. 123 in.), 0. 749 cm (0. 295 in.), and 1.14 cm (0.45 i.n. ).\nThe skin thickness of 0. 749 cm (0. 295 in.) was chosen so that this\nmonocoque cylinder would have the same buckling half-wave length in the\nlongitudinal direction as the waffle-stiffened shell which will be discussed\nlater.\nTable I, Cases 1 through 12., shows the shell geometry and buckling\nresults for these three skin thicknesses and four grid patterns. The results\nare compared with those calculated for the axisymmetric mode using the\ncomputer program given in Reference 1. As can be seen, the results improve markedly with increased grid refinement. These axisymmetric\nmonocoque results are also shown in a different form in Figure 4. The data\nis plotted in this manner to show the good correlation between the eigenvalue\naccuracy and the number of grid points per half-wave. Interestingly, the\nresults are almost independent of skin thickness for the cases examined.\nA plot such as Figure 4 is useful for estimating the required degree of\ngrid refinement needed to get results of the accuracy desired. To do this,\none must first know approximately what the buckling half-wave length is in\nthe longitudinal direction.\nA waffle-stiffened cylinder with a skin thickness of 0. 312 cm (0. 123 in.)\nwas also analyzed as a part of the first group. This cylinder was analyzed\nfor axisymmetric buckling, again using the four grid patterns shown in\nFigure 3. The shell geometry and buckling results for the four grid patterns\nare shown in Table I, Cases 13 through 16. The results are compared with\nthose calculated for the axisymmetric mode using a computer program based\non the theory given in Reference 2. These results are also plotted in\nFigure 4.\nNotice how the stiffened shell converges to the correct result more\nrapidly and with less grid points per half-wave than the monocoque cases.\nThis improvement appears to be directly caused by the presence of the beam\nelements. The differential stiffness derivation assumptions of the NASTRAN\nbeam element are considerably more refined than those of the NASTRAN\nplate -element. Thus, the presence of the beam elements causes a more\nrapid convergence to the correct buckling load.\nCases 1 through 16 show that accurate results can be obtained for\naxisymmetric buckling of monocoque and waffle-stiffened cylindrical shells\nif a sufficiently fine grid pattern is used.\n\nNon-Axisymmetric Buckling Cases\nThe second group to be analyzed contained wider cylindrical panels.\nThese panels were simply supported on all four sides so they would buckle\nin non- axisymmetric modes.\nFigures 5 and 6 show the two grid patterns used to analyze a 20. 7 \xc2\xb0 -wide\ncylindrical panel. This panel was first analyzed as a monocoque shell\nwithout the stiffeners shown in Figures 5 and 6. The two skin thicknesses\nexamined were 0. 749 cm (0. 295 in.) and 1. 14 cm (0. 45 in.). The skin\nthickness of 0. 312 cm (0. 123 in.) was not analyzed because there would not\nhave been sufficient grid points per half-wave for the two grid patterns\nbeing used. All of the interior grid points in each model were free for all\nsix degrees of freedom. It did not appear necessary to restrain rotation\nabout the radial axis, as would be necessary for a flat panel, because the\nfour quadrilateral elements meeting at a grid point were not co-planar.\nSince these panels met at a slight angle at the grid point, they produced a\nstiffness for rotation about the radial axis. The grid points at the top\nboundary of the model were restrained for radial displacement, tangential\ndisplacement, rotation about a radial axis, and rotation about a longitudinal\naxis. The bottom gi:.-id points were restrained the same as the top, with the\naddition of restraint for longitudinal displacement. The side grid points\nwere restrained for radial displacement, tangential displacement, rotation\nabout a radia.l axis, and rotation about a tangential axis.\nTable I, Cases 17 to 20, gives the results for these monocoque panels.\nThese results are compared with buckling loads calculated using the computer\nprogram in Reference 1. In obtaining the buckling load from the computer\nprogram in Reference 1, only mode shapes that would give an integer\nnumber of half-waves across the panel were considered, i.e., nine or a\nmultiple of nine circumferential full waves for a complete cylinder. The\nfour points show no major trend other than an improvement in the eigenvalue with increased grid refinement. Also, the results are not as good\nas those obtained for the same skin thicknesses for axisymmetric buckling.\nA waffle-stiffened cylinder with a skin thickness of 0. 312 cm (0.123 in.)\nwas also analyzed, using the two grid patterns shown in Figures 5 and 6.\nThe results for this cylinder are shown in Table I, Cases 21 and 2\xc2\xb72.\nInterestingly, the accuracy of the eigenvalues was as good or better than\nthose obtained for axisymmetric buckling of the same cylinder with the\nsame size grid. This is just the opposite of the monocoque results. Again,\nthis shows the marked effect of the beam elements.\n\n68\n\nAs a part of this second group, a larger stiffened model was also\nanalyzed using the two grid patterns shown in Figures 7 and 8. This model\ncaused some unexpected difficulties. The lP grid gave a buckling load\nbelow the correct value, whereas all preceding cases had given buckling\nloads above the correct value. In addition, a detailed examination of the\nresults showed the eigenvector (buckling mode shape) to have large tangential\ndisplacements and large rotations about the radial axis. The 4P grid model\nhad 2227 degrees of freedom and a semi band width of 168. It took 3 1 /2 hr\nof Central Processing Unit (CPU) time for a single buckling decomposition.\nThis was on a UNIVAC 1108 with 65, 000 words of core. It appeared that in\nrunning this model the computer would very like ly go down during the time\nspent in the Real Eigenvalue Analysis-Displacement (READ) Module.\nTherefore, NASTRAN was modified to print out each iteration in determining\nthe eigenvalue and to leave READ after the first eigenvalue was obtained.\nAll the program output was printed on tape as it was obtained, so that it\nwould not be lost if a machine failure occurred. The eigenvalue and eigenvector were finally obtained after 7 3/4 hr of CPU time and 28 1/2 hr of\nwall clock time. Unfortunately, these results showed the same low eigenvalue and unusual eigenvector as the IP grid model.\nAfter a thorough review, it was concluded that the strange results,\nwhich only appeared for this large model, were probably caused by the low\ngrid point stiffness for rotation about the radial axis. A study was initiated\nto determine if the correct results could be obtained by restraining all grid\npoints for rotation about the radial axis.\nThe study showed that restraining the rotation about the radial axis\nincreased the buckling load for the IP and 4P 20. 7 \xc2\xb0 -wide models less than\ntwo percent. This small change was desirable since these small models\nwere already giving reasonable results. Restraining the rotation about the\nradial axis produced a dr a matic improvement in the eigenvector and a\nsignificant improvement in the eigenvalue for the large models.\nTable I, Case 23, shows the results obtained for the lP 41. 4\xc2\xb0-wide\nmodel. Before running the 4P 40 \xc2\xb0-wide model, it was changed from\nquadrilateral to triangular elements. The quadrilateral model grid points\nhad been sequenced in horizontal rows so that its matrix had the minimum\npossible bandwidth with no active columns. Changing from quadrilateral\nelements to triangular elements reduced the vertical coupling in the model\nfrom two rows to one row. This change reduced the semi band width of the\nmatrix by 50 per c ent and reduced the C P U time required to run the model by\n78 percent. Figure 9 shows the triangular element model. The results for\nthis model with the rotational restraint are given in Case 24 of Table I. The\nskin moment of inertia in this model includes the bending stiffness of the\nfiber glass liner.\n\nRestraining the rotation about the radial axis corrected the problems in\nthe eigenvector for both models and brought the eigenvalues into a reasonable\nrange. For some currently unexplainable reason, the eigenvalues for both\nthese large models wer e not as close as those obtained for the 20. 7 \xc2\xb0 -wide\nmodels, but the buckling results and run times obtained for the 4P triangular\nmodel meant that the SWS window model could be run successfully. The\nconclusion of the study on restraint of rotation about the radial axis was that\nall future cylindrical panel models should be run with this restraint.\nSWS WINDOW ANALYSIS\nAll of the large models were sized so that a quarter segment of the SWS\nwindow could be placed in the lower corner of the model. Figure 10 shows\nthe SWS window model. The shaded area around the window is where the\nfiber glass liner was ,increased in thickness to raise the buckling capability.\nAround the edge of the window is a ring which is :relatively stiff for any\nmotion normal to the shell. Both the structure and loading are symmetric\nabout the right side and bottom of the model. A complete window was not\nmodeled because it was felt that accurate results could be obtained with a\nquarter segment. Also, a complete model w ould have four times the number\nof degrees of freedom, double the semiband width, and an unacceptably long\nrun time.\nThe model length was sized to allow at least three buckling half-waves\nabove the region with the increased stiffness and to allow a uniform load to\nbe applied at the top. The model width was sized so that the effect of the\nload shearing around the window would die out and so that the boundary\ncondition along the left edge would not appreciably affect the buckling load.\nThe window model was simply supported along the top edge and left\nside. Ideally, to obtain all possible buckling modes with a quarter segment\nmodel that would be obtainable from a complete model, the quarter segment\nmodel should have a symmetric boundary condition along the bottom and\nright side for the static analysis. This static analysis would be used to\ndetermine the loads on each element. These element loads would be used\nto calculate the differential stiffness matrix. Then the stiffness and\ndifferential stiffness matrices would be supported for four buckling boundary\nconditions. The four buckling boundary conditions are the four possible\ncombinations of symmetric and antisymmetric boundary conditions along the\nbottom and right side. Unfortunately, this dual boundary condition capability--one boundary condition for the static analysis and a second for the\nbuckling analysis - -is not currently available in NAST RAN. Therefore, for\nthe problem at hand, a compromise was made, and the four buckling boundary conditions were used for the complete analysis .\n\n70\n\nThe results of the buckling analysis of the window model for the four\nboundary conditions were good from an engineering standpoint but were\nrather unexciting from a research standpoint. All four boundary conditions\nshowed the buckling radial displacements to be occurring in the basic shell\nat the top of the model. For all four cases the radial displacements attenuated upon entering the area of increased stiffness around the window. Also,\nall four boundary conditi ons gave buckling loads within one percent of each\nother. The conclusion of the analysis was that the increase in bending\nstiffness was sufficient to prevent buckling around the window. Also, the\nbuckling capability of the basic shell adjacent to the area of increased stiffness was not lowered.\nSIMILAR BUCKLING ANALYSES IN PROGRESS\nThe SWS has a second major cutout in its cylindrical wall: the access\ndoor shown in Figure 11. As mentioned previously, the SWS is subjected\nto axial compressive loads during ground wind prior to launch and during\nboost to orbit. The access door is removed for the first condition and\ninstalled for the second condition. Figure 12 shows the access door model.\nThe buckli_ng analysis of this model for door-in and door-out conditions is\ncurrently in progress.\nIMPROVEMENTS TO NASTRAN\'S BUCKLING CAPABILITY\nAs previously mentioned, the assumptions used for the NASTRAN plate\nderivation are somewhat crude. To compensate for this shortcoming, fine\ngrids and longer run times are required to get accurate results. A second\nitem that causes run times to be longer than necessary for most problems\nis the use of an unsymmetric decomposition routine in the READ module.\nFor the 4P 40 \xc2\xb0 -wide quadrilateral element model the unsymmetric decomposition routine, which is used in the buckling analysis, to ok 23 times\nas long as the symmetric decomposition routine used for the static analysis.\nThis is unfortunate since the eigenvalue can be determined using a symmetric\ndecomposition. Also, the dual boundary condition is not available at present\nin NASTRAN. To facilitate the solution of the remaining Skylab buckling\nproblems and future buckling problems, Marshall Space Flight Center\n(MSFC) currently has a contract with the Mac Neal-Schwendler Corporation.\nTheir contract task is:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto develop an improved plate element for buckling\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto incorporate this plate element into the MSFC version of NAST RAN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto incorporate the dual boundary condition option into NASTRAN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nto provide a READ module with a symmetric decomposition routine\nfor NASTRAN.\n\n71\n\nThis contract should be completed this fall, and it is the author\'s understanding from talking with the NASA Contracting Officer\'s Representative\nfor this contract that the improvements to NASTRAN from the contract will\nbe made available to the NASTRAN Systems Management Office.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nTest cases have been presented which show that NASTRAN has the\ncapability to handle cylindrical panel buckling problems if a sufficiently\nfine grid point pattern is used. A good correlation has been shown between\neigenvalue accuracy and grid points per half-wave for axisymmetric buckling\nof monocoque and stiffened cylindrical panels. The importance of restraint\nof rotation about the radial axis at each grid point has been shown for\ncylindrical panels buckling in non-axisymmetric modes.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nDickson, J.

Bennett\nVought Aeronautics Company\nA Division of LTV Aerospace Corporation\nSUMMARY\n\nComparisons of internal member loads and stresses as generated by\nthe NASTRAN Differential Stiffness and Static Analysis methods are\npresented for a tandem side opening canopy. A description of the structure analyzed and the load condition for which it is analyzed are included\nalong with several computer and hand generated plots. The comparisons of\nthe two methods show a general decrease in the internal member loads obtained by the Differential Stiffness method of analysis over the Static\nmethod of analysis.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe magnitude of the design operating stresses in a canopy structure\nmust be reliably known to insure both minimum weight and structural integrity. Minimum weight is required since the canopy ejection thruster\nsize increases as the canopy weight increases. And, when pilot ejection\nthrough the canopy glass is required, the glass thickness must be as thin\nas possible. Determination of the stresses is complicated by the wide\nvariation in material properties over the service temperature range. The\ncomplex shape of a canopy and the varying external pressures acting on a\ncanopy structure also make the method of analysis difficult. The advent\nof structural analysis finite element computer programs has greatly eased\nthe task of obtaining internal member loads in complex structures and has\nincreased the accuracy of the solutions. However, to avoid unwarranted\nconservatisms in the design of a canopy the geometric non-linearity of\nthe structure should be taken into account. Since the stresses in a canopy\nglass are directly proportional to the radius of curvature of the glass\ncross-section, any great changes in shape during loading will greatly alter\nthe stresses in the glass and in the frames and side rails pf the structure.\nThrough the simultaneous consideration of large non-linear motions and the\napplied loads, NASTRAN generates a Differential Stiffness solution based\non the linear terms in the equations of motion of an elastic body. (Refer\nto the NASTRAN Theoretical M9.nual, ref. 1). Comparisons between the NASTRAN\nDifferential Stiffness Analysis and the Static Analysis of a tandem side\nopening canopy show significant reductions in member loads when the differential stiffness theory is applied to the solution.\n\n85\n\nSYMBOLS\nE\n\nYoung\'s modulus of elasticity\n\nG\n\nShear modulus of elasticity\n\n\xc2\xb5\n\nPoisson\'s ratio\n\nA\n\nCross-sectional area\n\nI1\n\nMoment of inertia about a.xis 1-1\n\nI2\n\nMoment of inertia about a.xis 2-2\n\nJ\n\nTorsional moment of inertia\n\nDESCRIPI\'ION OF THE STRUCTURE\nThe structure described is a tandem side opening canopy which was\nanalyzed during a recent company sponsored design program. The canopy\nconsists of two pieces of stretched acrylic 0.25 inches thick, three frames,\nand two side rails. The frames are located at each end and at the center\nof the curved acrylic. The side rails are located at the bottom edges of\nthe canopy acrylic and provide support for the frames and for the acrylic.\nBoth the frames and the side rails are constructed of 7075-T6 aluminum\nalloy in this application. This canopy is designed to open to the pilot\'s\nright and is supported by four hinges on the right side rail. When in the\nclosed position, the left hand side rail is latched at four points for side\nand vertical loads. Two shear pins, also located on the left side rail,\nextend into fuselage framing members and provide fore and aft restraint\nfor the left side of the canopy. A left side view of the canopy structure\nis given in Figure 1. Figure 2 includes a top view of the structwe and\nthe properties of the stretched acrylic. The side rail cross-section is\npresented in Figure 3 along with the section properties. Figure 4 includes\nthe cross-section and properties for the forward, mid and aft frames.\n\nEXTERNAL LOADING\nThe external loading applied to the canopy is a symmetrical flight\ncondition with an internal cabin pressure of 5.0 psi. The combined aer odynamic and internal pressure distribution is plotted aver the top view\nof the canopy in Figure 5. During the actual design phase, five separate\nload conditions were investigated. The most critical load case was an\nunsymmetrical flight condition. However, to accomplish the objective of\nthis paper the simpler of the load cases will suffice. To apply the\n\n86\n\nselected load condition to the equivalent structural model, the pressure\ndistribution of Figure 5 wa? plotted on a plan form view of the canopy\nacrylic. The pressure acting at the centroid of each finite element representing the acrylic was determined and applied to the element.\n\nNASTRAN FINITE ELEMENT MODEL\nThe finite element model representative of the canopy structure consists of 384 triangular bending plates and 203 six degree of freedan beams.\nThe finite element plates represent the canopy acrylic and are located\nat the center plane of the acrylic. The finite element beams represent\nthe side rails and the frames. The side rail elements are l ocated at the\nshear center of the actual structural side rail. This is done so that \xe2\x80\xa2\nthe reactions along the canopy side rails will be in a proper l ocati on.\nThe frame elements are located at the bending center of each frame. The\nfinite elements representing the side rails and the frames are tied to the\nelements representing the acrylic by short beams. These beams do not\nexist in the actual structure and are used only to transfer loads from\nthe acrylic to the frames and side rails. A stiffness of twice that of\nthe side rails was used for the beams. The geometry of the structure\nis defined by 360 grid points yielding a total of 2118 degrees of freedom. There are actually two coordinate systems used to define the structure. The XYZ coordinate system shown in Figure 6 is used to define all\nthe grid points except those at which the external reactions are located.\nThe reaction points are defined by the coordinate system X\' Y\' Z\' which is\nrotated 10.5\xc2\xb0 (counterclockwise when viewed from the left) about the Y\naxis of the XYZ coordinate system. The rotation places the X\' axis in the\nplane fonned by the canopy side rails and makes the Z\' axis perpendicular\nto the rails. The external reactions thus obtained are either in the\nplane of the side rails or perpendicular to the plane and represent the\nactual structural reactions between the canopy and the fuselage. The\ncanopy to fuselage tie points occur at 10 discrete points along the side\nrails. Referring to Figure 6, the reaction points 1, 2, 3 and 4 lie along\nthe left side rail and are Y\' and Z\' reacted. Tie points 1 thr ough 4\nrepresent the canopy latch points. Tie points 5 and 6 are also l ocated\non the left side rail and are reacted through scalar springs in the X\'\ndirection. The springs represent the stiffness of the shear pins. Reaction points 7, 8, 9 and 10 are located on the right side beam and represent the hinges of the canopy. These points are reacted in the X\' Y\' and\nZ\' directions.\nCcmputer generated plots showing the top, side and end views of all\nthe finite elements in the model are included in Figure 7, 8 and 9.\nFigure 10 is an orthographic three dimensional plot showing the canopy\nacrylic separated from the side rails, frames and standoffs.\n\nCOMPARISONS OF THE SOLUTIONS\nReferring to Figure 11 through 18 the following comparisons between\nNASTRAN generated solutions (with and without differential stiffness) for\ninternal member loads and stresses are presented.\nAcrylic Longitudinal Stresses\nFrom Figure 11, it is seen that the longitudinal stresses at the\ncenter plane of the acrylic are reduced by the application of differential\nstiffness theory. The maximum reduction occurs between the front and mid\nframes along longitudinal cut B. The 65% reduction in the static solution\nstress is accompanied by an 85% reduction in the displacement. (Fig. 12)\nAcrylic Hoop Stresses\nFigure 13 indicates only small changes in the acrylic hoop st resses.\nFrom a typical cross-section deflection plot (Fig. 14) it is seen that the\ncross-section is near circular to start with and when loaded, only small\nchanges in curvature are created. From membrane theory, the hoop stress\nis directly proportional to the radius of curvature. Therefore, only\nsmall changes in stress are expected when the initial section is near circular and near uniform loading on the section is present. The hoop stresses\nin the acrylic are distributed to the side rails and act as a running load\non a continuous beam. Since there is little change in the hoop stresses\nit is also expected that the reactions along the side rails will change\nproportionally. Figures 15 and 16 bear out this expectation.\nSide Beam Loads\nA noticable effect occurs when the geometric non-linearity of the\ncanopy is considered. The mid-frame effectiveness in supporting the\nside rails for vertical loading increases. From the vertical deflection\nplots in Figure 15 it is seen that the mid-frame creates an inflection\npoint between the two mid supports when differential stiffness theory\nis used. The bending moments in the side rail just above the vertical\nreactions increase and the mid span moments decrease when differential\nstiffness is accounted for. The maximum increase is 122% over the linear\nsolution at the front support. The maximum decrease occurs at mid span\nbetween the front support and the second support. The decrease is 66%\nover the linear solution. Figure 16 indicates only minor differences\nbetween the linear and non-linear solutions for the torsion and side\nloadings.\n\nMid-Frame Member Loads\nThe axial load in the mid-frame just above the side rail to mid-frame\njoint increases 90oo/o from the linear solution to the non-linear solution.\nThis increase in axial load indicates that the mid-frame is more effective\nin constraining the vertical motion of the side rails when differential\nstiffness theory is applied to the structure.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe comparisons made between NASTRAN generated solutions with and\nwithout differential stiffness for the canopy structure have lead to the\nfollowing conclusions:\nThe changes in geometry of a canopy cross-section greatly effect the\ninternal member loads within the structure. In order to obtain correct\ndesign operating stresses within a canopy, deformations of the canopy\nunder loading must be accounted for. The NASTRAN Static Analysis with\ndiffer\xc2\xb7e ntial stiffness offers a practical means for calculation of the design\noperating stresses.\nThe initial cross-section of the canopy influences the amount of\ndifference between a linear and non-linear solution. These differences\nare reduced as the section approaches a circular shape.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nMacNeal, Richard H., "The NASTRAN Theoretical Ma.nual, 11 NASA SP-221,\n\n1969.\n\n89\n\nFORWARD FRAME\n\n\\\n\n\\AFT FRAME\n\nMDl FRAME\n\n-\n\nZ 20.2\n\n-\n\nZ 37.9\n\n- - - Z 17.4\n\nz o.o\nI\n. .\n\nI\n\n. .\n\n..::t\n\n0\n\n0\n\nco\n\n0\n\nl.[\'\\\n,-j\n\nI\n\n. .II .

Schmitz\nSperr y Rand Corporation\nSpace Support Division\nHuntsville , Alabama\nABSTRACT\nThe NASTRAN program was used to perform a structural analysis of the\nApollo Telescope Mount (ATM) Solar Array Wing. A high fidelity model\ncontaining 8286 DOF was used for the launch (cinched) and orbital (deployed)\nconfigurations. Extensive use was made of the multi - point constraint\nfeature of NASTRAN to obtain proper load paths for the launch configuration\nand of the local coordinate feature to define subassemblies within the global\ncoordinate system. Changes in configuration from deplo yed to cinched\nwere obtained by rotating and translating the local coordinate systems.\nStatic and Differential Stiffness Solutions (Formats 1 and 4) were obtained.\nComparisons were made between these results and static load tests performed\nat NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper discusses the application of the large displacement theory\n(Differential Stiffness Format) of NASTRAN to the structural anal ysis of\nthe Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) Solar Array. Two dimensional (2D) and\nthree dimensional (3D) finite element models were developed for analysis.\nThe results are compared with test data, and a discussion of the results\nis included.\nThe analyses were performed by the Engineering Anal ysis Department of\nthe Sperr y Rand Space Support Division and sponsored by NASA Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC), Astrionics \xc2\xb7 Laboratory, under contract NASS-20055.\nThe tests were performed by MSFC Test Laboratory.

This model\nwas used for detailed stress analysis of the array in both the cinched and\ndeployed configurations.\nTwo dimensional Mod elThe 2D finite element model o f the ATM Solar Array (W ing) is shown i n\nFigure 4.\nIt co ns ists of 21 grid points and 20 bar eleme nts.\nThis model\nrepresents the bending, axial and shear stiffness of the outboard beam and\nscissor.\nThe model has 62 degrees of freedom (DOF) and a very narrow bandwidth,\nresulting in in-core decomposition and static solutions. The validity of\nthe model is bas e d upon the assumption that, for out-of-plane loads, the\nwing behaves as a cantilever beam and the panel side rails and the scissor\nmembers react the loads.\nSince the model does not contain in-plane stiffness\nelements, only out-of-plane loads were examined with this model.\nThree dimensional ModelThe three dimensional (3D) finite element model of the deplo y ed W\ning\n(Figure 5) contains 1443 finite elements composed of bar, rod and quadrilateral plates, and 1381 grid points.\nThe complete assembled stiffness\nmatri x, K99 , has 8286 DOF .\nThere are 7 54 DOF constrained through boundar y\nconditions and constraint equations (SPC\'s and M\nPC\'s), leaving 7532 DOF in the\nanal y sis stiffness matrix, K11\nFigure 6 illustrates the detailed model of a typical panel and scissor\nsubstructure.\nAmong the many NASTRAN modeling features used to develop\nthis model were :\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEach panel and scissor gridpoints were defined in separate local\ncoordinate systems (11 total).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAl l loads were applied in the basic coordinate s y stem and all\ndisplacements were recovered in the local coordinate systems\n( 1, 2, etc. ) .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multipoint constraint equations wer e used to attach the scissor\nto the supporting structure (Mounting Structure).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hinge connections between each panel, between each scissor and\nbetween scissor and panels, were modeled using the pin release\nfeature of the bar elements.\n\nl09\n\nThe honeycomb modules were coarsely modeled using four CQUAD2\nelements for each module .\nThe following properties were used :\nFacing,\n1010 N/m2\n\nEf\n\n=\n\n6.8946\n\nX\n\nGf\n\n=\n\n2.62\n\n10\n\npf\n\n=\n\n10,308. kg/m\n\npf\n\n=\n\n13458. kg/m\n\nE\n\n= 6.8946\n\nX\n\n1010 Nlm 2\n\nX\n\n10\n\nX\n\n10\n\nN/m\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n(107 lb/in 2 )\n(3.8\n\n3\n(0.3724 lb/in )\n3\n.

P oor agreement was\nobtained using the 3D model for both theories , wher eas , the 2D model gave\nacceptable results for both.\nSeve ral characteristics of the model and\nactual wing are apparent from the displacement results:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n110\n\nThe fixity which occurs at the 2nd and 4th hinges, during +Z loads,\nis apparent from th e continuit y of slope at these hinges; while\na large discontinuit y occurs at both the 1st and 3rd hinges\nwhere no fixity exist.\nThe change in tip deflection from linear to lar ge displacement\ntheory, was -11 percent for the 2D model and -6 percent for the\n3D model.\nIn the case of the 2D model this change was approximatel y\nthe same as the accurac y of the test data, !6 percent.\nIt is\ninconclusive, based upon the displacement results alone , whe ther\nlarge displacement theor y is necessar y.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The 3D model is too flexible for out-of-plane loads. The tip\ndeflection was 44 percent greater than test. Studies to determine\nthe source of the increased flexibility are currently being\nperformed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Due to the large displacement hysteresis observed during the\ntest, the displacements are not the best criteria for comparing\ntest and theory.\nThe scissor moment diagrams for the linear and large displacement\ntheories are compared in Figure 9. Figure 9 contains the result~ for\nthe 2D and 3D models and test data. The panel moment diagrams are shown\nin the same figure. The moment at the intersection of a panel and scissor\nis statically determinant and the total moment at any intersection is equal\nto the sum of the scissor moment and panel moment (Figure 10). From the\ntest data, super-imposed on Figure 9, it is shown that a large fraction\n{33 percent) of the total moment is carried by the panels. The large\ndisplacement theory predicted 17 percent of the moment in the panels,\nwhile the linear displacement theory predicted only 0.2 percent.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs acknowledged by the NASTRAN authors, Reference 4, the Differential\nStiffness format does not account for changes in the load distribution\nresulting from geometry changes. In the problem discussed in this paper\nthe radial displacements of the wing, due to large rigid body movement, were\nnot predicted by the large displacement theory. The movement inboard due to\nthe large out-of-plane motion is not accounted for, and the reduction\nin the scis sor and panel bending moments resulting from the geometry change\nwere not calculated. This inaccuracy along with known errors in the test\ndata accounts for the difference between test and large displacement theory\nresults of the 2D model. The errors in the 3D model are more serious and\nadditional study as to the source is currently being :performed.\nThe most significant result of this study was the prediction of large\nbending moments in the panel by the large displacement theory, which were\nnot predicted by the linear theory.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nGreer, A.T., "Results of A1M Solar Wing (Development Model) Deployment\nTests", NASA, MSFC, S&E-ASTN-TF-10-71, March 1, 1971.\n\n2.\n\nVaught, E.W., "A1M Solar Array Docking Loads Test Evaluation," Sperry\nSpace Support Division, Sperry Rand Corp., SP-209-0519, August 1971\n\n3.\n\n"Structural Analysis of A1M Solar Array Assembly", Bahos, D.

Smoot Katow\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nSUMMARY\n\nProgressing from a space frame analysis (STAIR) using only prismatic\nbars connected at frictionless pin joints and one quadrant of input data, the\nstructural model of the 64-m-diameter reflector structure was upgraded with\nthe use of the NASTRAN program. Bars with bending resistance (CBARS) and\nplates (CQDMEM, CTRMEM and CSHEAR) were added at appropriate locations. The deflection results computed for the gravity loading case are closely\ncorrelated to field measured values and operational RF tests. Expansion of\nthe input data to I /2 structure permitted studies of minor structural modifications which, if implemented, should result in lower deformations from gravity\nloads. Procedures used to check for correct input data are noted.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe NASA/JPL (National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory) Deep Space Instrumentation Facility (DSIF) 64-mdiameter antenna system with an azimuth-elevation axes type mount (figs. 1\nand 2) commenced operation in April, 1966, at Goldstone, California. In\nJune, 1963, the Rohr Corporation was awarded the contract to accomplish the\nfinal design, fabrication and erection.\nDetermining with precision the distortions of the paraboloidal reflective\nsurface supported by the reflector structure under the environmental loads i\'s\na prime requisite in correctly predicting the radio-observing efficiency of the\nantenna system (ref. 1). The discussion in this paper will be limited to the\ncalculation of distortions from gravity loading only. Specifically, these distortions are caused by the gravity loading that results from an elevation angle\nchange from the 45\xc2\xb0 surface setting angle to the zenith look angle. At 45\xc2\xb0,\nthe surface panels are adjusted or set to fit the design paraboloid.\n\n*This\n\npaper presents the results of one phase of re search carried out at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\nContract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration.\n\n123\n\nThe calculation that results in precise distortion numbers requires\nrigorous mathematical models (matrices) of structures. Their solutions\nrequire the use of electronic computers. In reference 2, the results from one\nsystem of matrix interpretive routine (STAIR, ref. 3) applied to the 64-m\nreflector structure are reported. The solutions were based on a one-quadrant\nstructural model truss using bar members with pin - jointed connections. In\nthis report, the structural model i\'s upgraded by using a true 1/2 section comprised of some bars with bending stiffness where appropriate; plates, where\nused, are mathematically modeled. This analysis used the NASTRAN program (ref. 4). It is shown by comparisons to field data that predictions of\ngravity loading distortions can be made precisely with the use of NASTRAN.\nOne requisite to precise answers is accurate input data that describes the\nstructure correctly. Also , the data must satisfy the key punching formats\nrequired by NASTRAN . To prevent obvious wasteful computing time,\nNASTRAN internally provides a large number of data checking algorithms.\nHowever, due to the existing computer costing formulas applicable to the 1108\nExec 8, this checking can result in excessive costs that are principally the\nresult of multiplying the largest amount of core used by the CPU time . Suggestions made by others that the dry-run checking of input data may be economical is seconded. Some algorithms developed .for dry-run checking of\nSTAIR and SAMIS input data are suggested for possible use in checking\nNASTRAN input data.\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nRMS\n\nroot-mean- s quare sense of the RF pathlength errors\n\nRF\n\nradio frequency waves\n\nSC4020\n\nStromberg-Carlson Photo Plotting Machine\n\n6 4-m REFLECTOR STRUCTURE ANALYSIS HISTORY\n\nIt was in the later months of 1961 that the 64-m antenna project developed\na need for a large structural analysis program suitable for engineering use.\n\nAt JPL, our Spacecraft Design Section had a need for rigorous mathematical models and their solutions to satisfy exotic requirements. The section I s\nmain interest was the analysis of the vibrational forces on a spacecraft during\nthe launch operations. This need resulted in the development of the JPL/\nSTIF-EIG program (ref. 5) by the middle of 1961. Later, the SAMIS program\n(ref. 6) was developed for structures larger than the maximum size of 130\ndegrees-of-freedom of STIF-EIG.\nThese JPL developed programs could not satisfy the static analysis requirements of the 64-m reflector structure because a large matrix solution\n\n124\n\nwas necessary with the resultant prohibitively long computing time. The\nwavefront concept was not developed at this time. An algorithm for effectively\ndecreasing the matrix size before the decomposition was needed to analyze\nlarge antenna structures.\n\nIn late 1958, Lincoln Laboratory commissioned the Civil Engineering\nDepartment of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop the STAIR\nprogram (ref. 3). Although limited to analysis using bar members with pin\njoints, the problem inherent in a large matrix solution was avoided with the\nuse of a solution algorithm that required the division of the structure into\nsmaller units, which resulted in smaller matrices to invert. By provisions\nfor reducing matrix sizes and the addition of matrices with further reduction\nof the summed matrix, it was pas sible to solve large structures that included\nsome bar members with large bandwidth.\nPIN-JOINTED/ONE-QUADRANT STRUCTURAL MODEL\nThe distortion results for the 64-m reflector structure under the gravity\nloading case of interest are reported in reference 2. The analysis program\nused was STAIR.where the bar members are limited to pin-jointed ends. The\nquantity of input data converted to the sizes of the dimension statements in the\nload generating portion of STAIR was close to the limits of the 7094 core\ncapacity. Larger data would have necessitated supplemental computer runs\nwith subsequent data processing definitely not desirable.\nThe computations proceeded with one quadrant of input data and restraints\nat the symmetry planes as developed by complying with the conditions noted by\nNewell (ref. 7). Even with one quadrant of input data modeling all the members, there were 750 GRIDs and 2565 CONRODs (using NASTRAN terminology).\nWhen FORCE cards were included, the total card count reached almost 6000\ncards at times. For three loading conditions, the 7094 computing time\nstarted at 90 minutes initially, which was reduced to 55 minutes after some\ntime studies resulted in more efficient use of the chain subroutine with the\n7094 computer.\nThe principal difficulties in STAIR analysis were (1) the satisfying of the\nmany rules of arranging the many structural units and (2), common with all\ncomputing programs, the generation of correct input data. When Lincoln\nLaboratory added a dry run checking program, this program was expanded at\nJPL to generate the loading program data. Further expansion resulted in a\nSC4020 structural plotting capability with viewing angles limited normal to the\nthree planes of the coordinate system.\nTo predict matrix singularities caused by planar joints (since the member\njoints are frictionless), STAIR initially included a vector analysis algorithm\nfor spotting planar joints of the internal nodes of each unit only. This checking scheme was expanded to check the complete\xc2\xb7 structure with the effects of\nconstraints included ( see Appendix). Also, it was pas sible to count and output\nthe number of bars conpected to each node, and this information proved to be\nenlightening at times where symmetrical structures were checked.\n\n125\n\nAlthough the planar condition at each node can be checked as determined\nby the connecting bars, the frame can still be unstable, and the whole structure can exist in a 11 flying 11 condition by not being tied to "ground. 11 For checking matrix singularities caused by instabilities at the nodes, we are suggesting that it may be possible to check for bending stiffnesses at the nodes for\nframes using CBARs.\nFor large structures, we found that it was easier to check the individual\ntree 11 (BAR) in a "forest" (STRUCTURE) by sequencing the bar node numbers,\nfirst with respect to the first node against the second node, then sequencing\nwith the first node followed by a sequenced second node for bars with the same\nfirst node numbers. In this way, undesirable wrong bars and duplicate bars\ncan be spotted.\n11\n\nFurther checks in a dry-run program can be made by computing and printing the gravity generated load vectors and the center of gravity, particularly\nhelpful with symmetrical structures. (NASTRAN provides this with parameter GRDPNT and OLOAD cards.) Furthermore, the true bandwidth of the\nnodes can be easily computed by sequencing, renumbering, and differencing\nalgorithms.\nWith the availability of the SEQGP cards in NASTRAN, the bandwidth as\nwell as conversion to active column node numbers may be changed to suit.\nR. Levy of JPL has converted bandw idth re-numbering routines to produce\nSEQGP cards directly by computer analysis.\nAs input data were being prepared for the one-quadrant data for the first\ntime, some apprehension as to the answers arose so it was decided to analyze\nthe 1/4 reflector structure alone, for accuracy checking, without the elevation\nwheel assembly. To do this, the structure was revised to be symmetric about\nthe 45-degree line or plane and the structure was computed for a Z direction\ngravity loading with only one Z support at C as shown on figure 3. Symmetric\nconstraints were used at the YZ and XZ planes. As you can see, the symmetry of the deflection results, which also include the NASTRAN solution,\nshow$ that the deflection answers are precise enou~h for engineerin~ use. It\nshould be noted that several trials were needed to obtc3:in this symmetry as this\ntype of structure with the constraints and the single support is very sensitive\nto a slight lack of symmetry.\n\nNASTRAN 1/2-REFLECTOR ANALYSIS\n\nOur interest in upgrading the structural model from 1/4 to 1/2 reflector\nhad continued because of ( 1) the discrepancies in performance as predicted\nand as resolved by RF operating tests using radio stars in February 1968\n(fig. 4 and ref. 8) and (2) the desire to improve the gravity loading distortion\nby rearrangement of some truss members that could only be checked with a\n1/2-structural model. The 1/2-model input data using pin-jointed members\nwere generated and some test runs were made during the development of\nNASTRAN when the NASA contractors were using the computers located at\nJPL.\n\n126\n\nThe plan view of the structure is shown on figure 5 with the elevation\ncross-sectional view on figure 6.\nSince the short rib trusses between the\nmain rib trusses at the outer edges served as frames for supporting the surface panels, they were removed and replaced with equivalent weights or\nFORCE cards. To distinguish the nodes that serve to connect the reflector\nstructure to the elevation wheel assembly, these nodes were shown as\nenlarged "dots" on figures 5 and 6. These nodes plus the elevation wheel\nnodes were then numbered with large GRID numbers. Hence, the stiffness\nmatrix values for these large numbers place them in the active column spaces.\nAs shown in Table 1, the model was upgraded starting with analysis using\njust pin-jointed bar members (CONROD) to finally a structural model with\nbars with bending resistance (CBAR) and plates (CSHEAR, CTRMEM,\nCQDMEM).\nThe pin-jointed input data totaled a little less\xc2\xb7 than 8000 cards or 4 boxes;\nthese were transferred to the User\'s Master Tape by the NASA contractor for\ntheir use and then transferred to us. With their use an unknown number of\ntimes plus our use of at least 20 times in a span totaling 3 years, the one\nUser\'s Master Tape has remained usable. On the other hand, some NASTRAN\nexecutable tapes have become unreadable in 6 months.\nBy using the REPCASE card, the displacement of the top nodes of the\nreflector structure were requested for punched card output. These data then\nbecame input to the best fitting RMS program (ref. 9) that computes the RMS\nof the pathlength errors and outputs contour level plots using the SC4020\nplotter controlled by tapes generated by the RMS plotting subroutines in the\n1108.\nUsing the method described in reference 2 to compute the RMS surface\ndistortion at various elevation angles with the surface panel set to nominal\nparaboloid at 45 degrees elevation, the computed values for the one-quadrant\nSTAIR and the 1/2-reflector NASTRAN analyses are shown on figure 6 for\nevery 15 degrees. Overlaid are the RMS results as determined from radio\nmeasurements (ref. 8) showing the mean and standard deviation limits that\ninclude only the measurement scatter. The 64-m antenna configuration used\nthe mono-cone RF set-up for these test values.\nAs figure 4 shows., predictions of the RMS surface distortion based on\nmatrix analysis using NASTRAN with the upgraded structural model are\nclosely correlated to the measured values using the field theodolite and to the\nvalues based on radio-observed measurements.\n\nWhen the 64-m antenna was reconfigured with the Tri-Cone RF feed system in January 1970, as shown in figure 1, the field measurements were remade for the first time since the antenna was placed into operation. An\nimproved technique was used for the theodolite measurements. Figure 7\nshows the comparisons between the computed, using the improved model, and\nthe field measured values. The sharp imaging of the contour levels outlines\nare apparent.\n\n127\n\n64-m STRUCTURE UP-GRADE\n\nWith the availability of the 1/2-reflector model, it was possible to study a\nrearrangement of the connections between the reflector structure and the elevation wheel assembly. The existing knee bars shown dotted in figure 8 were\nremoved and replaced with new reaction bars that, at first glance, appear to\ndestroy symmetry. However, the n.ew reaction bars are loaded only by the\nanti- symmetric force component as in the horizon look-gravity loading case.\nIn the symmetric loading case, these bars provide only balancing forces.\nThe improvements for full loading of the antisymmetric gravity component resulted in a reduction distortion by a factor of 3. 5; the symmetric loading distortion also decreases slightly (ref. 10).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt can be concluded that truss-type reflector structures can be precisely\nanalyzed for distortions resulting from gravity force, and for wind forces and\ntemperature loading if the forces and temperatures can be accurately de scribed;\nthis analysis can be performed by the NASTRAN structural computing program\nwithin reasonable cost and time.\nA separate dry-run program for checking input data should be useful for\n1108 Exec 8 operation in reducing computer costs since the cost computing\nalgorithm, at present, penalizes programs that occupy large amounts of working core space.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nRuze, J.: Antenna Tolerance Theory - A Review, Proceedings of the IEEE,\nVol. 54, No. 4, pp. 633-640, April 1966.\n\n2.\n\nKatow, M.

Cook\nCommunications Satellite Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe COMSAT General Antenna Package (GAP), when used in conjunction with the NASTRAN Structural Analysis Program, provides\nthe capability for directly determining the effects of structural distortions on reflecting antenna patterns.\nAn important feature of the GAP program is that the data\nformat for coordinate systems, element definitions, grid point\nlocations and displacements is identical to that of the NASTRAN\nprogram, thereby eliminating the necessity for data conversion\nand minimizing the ambiguity which often arises in the description of a program in two distinct engineering disciplines.\nThe analysis procedures in GAP are specifically designed to\naccommodate finite element data in an efficient manner.\nIn\nparticular, a displacement function is assumed for each surface\nelement which is completely analogous to that used in the finite\nelement derivation.\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of NASTRAN-GAP as an\nanalysis tool, the radiation pattern from a parabolic reflector\nis calculated for both gravity and thermal loads.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe difficulties of transferring information between two\ndistinct engineering disciplines are readily apparent when\nattempting to trace radiation fields through reflecting antennas\nwhose deflections are determined by means of a finite element\nprogram. For example , due to the size and complexity of the\n\n141\n\ndata involved, any conversion is prone to errors and misinterpretations. But more importantly, the techniques commonly used\nin tracing the radiation field fail to take advantage of the\nspecial properties of finite element output data (e.g., the\nspecification of grid point rotations and the capability for\nhandling faceted surfaces). As a consequence, such techniques\nrequire the conversion of finite element data to a more tractable form, with a resulting loss in accuracy.\nIn order to create \xc2\xb7an efficient general purpose antenna analysis capa.bility, it was recognized that these problems had to be\novercome. There\xc2\xb7f ore, when work was begun on the COMSAT General\nAntenna Package in August 1970, the NASTRAN data format was\nadopted as the medium of communication between the two programs.\nCapabilities of the GAP program include calculation of\ncurrents on each reflector, the radiation field at any point in\nthe system, and far-field radiation patterns and gain, as \' well\nas the generation of correcting subreflectors. A broad range\nof user options and convenience features is provided.\nThe fields in the vicinity of the reflecting surfaces are\nfound by means of a ray trace procedure in which the second\nderivatives of the wavefront are calculated for each ray. This\ninformation is used in determining both the divergence factor\nassociated with each ray, and the second derivatives of the\nphase which are required by the wavefront integration scheme, a\nfast and accurate technique for determining the far-field\npattern.\n\nPROGRAM CAPABILITIES\n\nThe General Antenna Package provides the capability for\ntracing a radiation field (either transmitted or received)\nthrough a reflecting antenna system.\nIn the case of transmission, the far-field radiation pattern may be determined, along\nwith associated measures of antenna performance. User options\ninclude the calculation of the field on a specified aperture\nplane and the current distribution over any reflecting surface.\nAn additional capability is provided for the generation of\ncorrecting subreflectors.\n\n142\n\nThe input format is designed for maximum flexibility and\nconvenience to the user. For example, up to twenty arbitrary\ncoordinate systems (either rectangular, cylindrical or spherical) may be defined by the user for specifying radiation fields\nor reflecting surfaces.\nThe data are divided into three sections: A Control Deck,\na Bulk Data Deck and a Deformation Deck. Bulk Data cards defining coordinate systems, grid points and element connections\nare identical to those in the NASTRAN deck, while the Deformation Deck consists of the NASTRAN punched output defining the\ngrid point displacements.\nEach radiation field in the vicinity of the antenna is\nrepresented by a collection of rays. There is no restriction\non the number of rays defining a radiation field.\nEach ray is\ndefined by its point of origin, direction, amplitude, _associated\narea, phase, cumulative path length, and the second derivatives\nof the wavefront. When polarization is considered, the field\ncomponents in two mutually perpendicular directions are also\nincluded.\nEach reflecting surface is defined by specifying the coefficients of a polynomial equation, of which several types\nare provided. Alternately, the surface may be defined by an\narray of grid points connected by discrete triangular or quadrilateral elements, each of which corresponds to a finite element\nused in the structural analysis. The details of this formulation are discussed in the following section.\nGiven a description of the reflecting antenna system and\nthe radiation field at any point in the system, the field at\nany subsequent point may be determined. This process involves\nfinding, for each ray in the field, its point of intersection\nwith the succeeding surface and then updating the ray origin,\npath length, amplitude and associated area accordingly.\n(The\nlatter two items are functions of the divergence factor, which\nis in turn a function of both the distance traveled and the\nwavefront derivatives at the previous surface.) Now, knowing\nthe first and second derivatives of both the incident wavefront\nand the reflecting surface, the corresponding derivatives of the\nreflected wave.f ront may be found.\nThese quantities determine\nboth the direction of the reflected ray and the curvature of the\nreflected wavefront.\n\nAt the user\'s option, the far-field radiation pattern of a\ntransmitting antenna may be found by integration over the aperture field or over the current on the primary reflector.\nSeveral\nalternate aperture plane integration schemes are provided. The\nwavefront method involves a simple summation of the effects of\neach ray in the aperture field.\nThe accuracy of this method\nrelies on the fact that all first and second derivatives of the\nwavefront (and hence the phase) have been previously computed.\nTwo additional methods are available for determining the far\nfield; the first is based on the Fast Fourier Transform and the\nsecond on a technique developed by Ludwig (reference 1).\ncalculated field and current information may be output in\nprinted tabular form, plotted in contour form or as cuts through\nspecified planes, or else stored on cards or disk for subsequent\nrestart.\nThe principal options available to the user are summarized\nin the following table:\nSINGLE EQUATION\nSURFACES___/\n\n~\n\nDISCRETE ELEMENTS\n\n--<\n\nDEFORMED\nUNDEFORMED\n\nUNPOLARIZED\nFIELD TYPE\n\n-<\n\nPOLARIZED\n\nPLANE\n\n<\n\n------c\n\nELLIPTICAL\n\nCONSTANT\nFIELD AMPLITUDE \\\n\nVARIABLE (DIVERGENCE FACTOR)\nCURRENT\nINTEGRATION\n\n144\n\n/\nLUDWIG\n~APERTURE-------<WAVEFRONT\nFFT\n\nDISCRETE ELEMENTS\nThe discrete element formulation is designed to accommodate\ndeformed surfaces analyzed by finite element structural analysis\nprograms (specifically the NASTRAN program), surfaces defined in\nterms of measured data, and surfaces composed of many segments,\neach represented by a separa~e equation. This latter category\nincludes the special case of faceted surfaces composed of a large\nnumber of flat plates.\nIn the discrete element approach, the surface is defined by\ngiving the locations of grid points in arbitrary coordinate\nsystems, and by defining triangular or rectangular surface elements connecting those points. Each surface element is defined\nby listing the three or four grid points to which it is connected\nand by selecting the equation defining the surface over that\ntriangular or quadrilateral region.\nThe ray trace procedure for surfaces composed of discrete\nelements differs from that for smooth surfaces in the following\nrespects:\n1)\n\nFor each ray in the field, a search is made through\nthe element list to determine which element the ray\nintersects.\n\n2)\n\nEach element points to an equation describing the\nreflecting surface over the element.\nIn the\n"undeformed" mode of analysis, the ray trace is\nperformed in the usual manner, using the equation\nassociated with the intersected element as the\nsurface equation.\nIn the "deformed" mode, the\ngrid point displacements specified in the Deformation Deck are used to find a polynomial approximation to the deformed element surface.\n\nThe mathematical details involved in finding the intersected\nelement and in approximating the deformed surface are shown below. Other aspects of the ray trace have been discussed briefly\nin the previous section and are not of concern here.\nFor each element defining the\nment" coordinate system (x,y,z) is\ngrid point lies at the origin, the\ntive x axis, and the third lies in\n\nreflecting surface, an "eledefined, such that the first\nsecond lies along the posithe x-y plane.\n\ny\n\ny\n\nX\n\nX\n\nThe element coordinate systems for both triangular and\nquadrilateral elements are shown in the diagram above.\nIn the\nundeformed mode, the original grid point locations are used7 in\nthe deformed mode, the grid point locations are incremented by\nthe translations prescribed in the Deformation Deck.\nThe incident ray is then converted from the basic system\nto the element system, and the intersection of the ray with the\nx-y plane is determined. This point is denoted (xa, Ya>\xc2\xb7\nIt\nnow remains to determine whether (xa, Ya) lies within the\nboundaries of the element, a straight-forward process which will\nnot be belabored here.\nIf the ray does not intersect the element, the next element in the list is selected and the process\nis repeated.\nFor quadrilateral elements, one additional step is required.\nEach quadrilateral may be considered to contain two triangular\nregions, bounded by grid points 1 - 2 - 3 and 1 - 3 - 4, respectively. The triangular region in which (xa, Ya) lies is treated\nas a triangular element in the remainder of the analysis.\nIn the deformed element coordinate system, the deformed surface is approximated by the polynomial\n\n(1)\nNotice in equation (1) that the coefficients of the x 2 y\nand xy 2 terms have been made equal. Some assumption of this\nkind was necessary, since the coefficients are evaluated in\nterms of nine displacement components (three at each corner)\nand, hence, cannot exceed nine in number.\nIt should be\n\n146\n\nemphasized that an expansion of this type was chosen quite arbitrarily, and that alternate representations may well yield\nmore accurate results.\nThe coefficients may be evaluated in terms of the values\nof z, oz/ox and oz/oy at each corner point, which are obtained\nby transforming the undeformed surface equation to the deformed\nelement system, and adding in the effects of the grid point rotations in the x-y plane. We define,\n\n=\n\n1.\n\n1,2,3\n\n( 2)\n\nwhere i indicates the grid point number as in the diagram above.\nNotice that x 1 = y 1 = y 2 =- 0, because of the manner in which the\nelement coordinate system was defined. By differentiating\nequation (1) with respect to x and y,\n\n(3)\n\nand by evaluating equations (1) and (3) at each corner point,\nthe following values of the coefficients are obtained:\n\na2\na3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nas\n\n=\n\nao\nal\n\nZ1\nZxl\n\nzyl\n\n-\n\n_l_(Z2\nX2\n\n1_\n\n2\n;d\n\n[zx2\n\n-\n\nZ1\n\n-\n\nZx X2\n]\'\n\n=\n\na4\n\n=\n\nZx~\n\nasX2 3)\n\n- ,L(z2 -\n\nZxl\n\nX2\n\na7\n\n-\n\nZ1\n\n-\n\n( 4)\n\nzxrx2\n\n>]\n\nX2\n\n-\n\nzx 1\n\n.!_(zy2 X2\n\n-\n\n2a3\n\ny 3 (zy 2 - zy 1 )/x2 - 3a6 x 3\n(-y3X2 + 2x3 Ys + Ys 2 )\n\nZYl\n\n-\n\nx3\n\n-\n\n2\n\na7X22)\n\n147\n\nas = 2\n3\nY3\n\n[-t\n\nZ3 + Z1 + Zx X3 + Zyl Y3 + a3X3\nl\nY3 (zy - z Y1 - a4X3\n3\n2\n\n-\n\na7 (X3 2\n\n2\n\n+ a 4 X3 Y3\n\n+ 2x3 Y3))\n\n2\n3\n+ a5X3 + a7 (X3 Y3 + X3 Y3 2 )]\nas = - 1 [z y - 2y\n2y3\n3\n\nl\n\n-\n\na4X3\n\n-\n\na7 (X3 2 + 2x3 Y3)\n\n-\n\n3aay32J\n\nWe now wish to approximate the surface equation at point\n(xa,Ya).\nTo do so, we will need an expression for the second\nderivatives of the surface7 hence, from equation (3) ,\n\n(5)\n\nNow,\ngives ,\n\na Taylor series expansion about the point (x a,Ya)\n\nz ~ za + (x - xa)Zxa + (y - Ya) zya +\n+\n\n(x - xa) (y - Ya) zxya +\n\n\xc2\xbd\n\n\xc2\xbd\n\n(y - Ya)\n\n(x - xa)\n2\n\nzyya\n\n2\n\nzxxa\n(6)\n\nor expressed in an equivalent form:\n\n( 7)\n\nwhere,\nbo\n\n=\n\nZa\n\n-\n\nXa 2 xa\n\n-\n\nk 2\nYa 2 ya + 2xa 2 xxa\n\n+ XaYa 2 xya + k 2 2 yya\n2Ya\nbl\n\n2 xa\n\nb2\n\n148\n\n=\n=\n\nZya\n\n-\n\nXa 2 xxa\n\n-\n\nYa 2 xya\n\nYa 2 yya\n\n-\n\nXa 2 xya\n\nb3\n\n=\n\n-1\n\nb4\n\n=\n\n\xc2\xbdzxxa\n\nbs\n\n=\n\n\xc2\xbdzyya\n\nbs\n\n=\n\n0\n\nb7\n\n=\n\n2\n\nbe\n\n=\n\n0\n\nxya\n\nb9 = 0\nNow, equation (7) approximates the deformed sur.face in the\nvicinity of point (xa, Ya), which is the point where the incident ray intersects the plane through the three corner points of\nthe element.\nThis equation may be used to determine the point\nwhere the ray strikes the deformed surface as well as the properties of the reflected ray.\nThe approximation of equation (1) by equation (7) was\noccasioned solely by the availability of software for handling\nsecond order polynomials. More accurate results would doubtless\nbe obtained by the direct solution of equation (1).\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nPARABOLIC REFLECTOR WITH DISTORTIONS\n\nThis example demonstrates the manner in which a distorted\nreflecting surface is handled by the General Antenna Package\nwhen the surface deformations are determined analytically by\nNASTRAN. No attempt has been made to compare the results with\ntheoretical or experimental data.\nA comparison between GAP\nresults and experimental measurements for an actual antenna may\nbe found in reference 2.\nIn this example, we wish to find the characteristics of a\nradiation field reflected from a deformed parabolic reflector,\nknowing the structural properties of the antenna and the nature\nof the applied load. We will examine two cases of particular\ninterest: distortions due to a gravity load on the structure ~\nand those due to a known temperature distribution.\n\n149\n\nThe finite element model of the reflector is shown on the\nfollowing page7 in the interests of simplicity, the support\nstructure has not been modeled~ and is represented only by the\nconstraints at grid points 40, 44 and 48. The direction of the\ngravity load is at 45\xc2\xb0 to they axis, as shown on the left of\nthe diagram. Thermal distortions are to be calculated for the\nsimple temperature distribution indicated on the right-hand\nview7 the shaded portion of the surface is 20\xc2\xb0 F warmer than the\nnon-shaded portion.\nThe NASTRAN input data for this problem are listed below.\nAll grid point and element data were generated by the AXIS program.*\nThe gravity load applied to the structure\nis automatically calculated by NASTRAN based on the geometry\nand density of the material, and on the direction of the gravity\nvector .

This deck becomes the Deformation\nDeck in the GAP input data.\nIn addition, all Bulk Data Cards containing grid point, element and coordinate system information may be included directly\n.in the GAP Bulk Data Deck.\nBoth types of data are included in the GAP input listing\nbelow, which is for the thermal case only. Additional information required by GAP includes the specification of a feed field\n(see the TABLE card in the Bulk Data Deck) and the equation of\nthe undeformed surface -- in this case, a parabola of the form,\n-100.0z + l.0x 2 + l.0y 2 = O\nThe coefficients of this equation are defined on the EQN\ncard in the Bulk Data Deck.\nThe "deformed" mode of analysis has been selected, indicating that the grid point displacements in the Deformation Deck\nare to be used to modify the surface equation over each element.\n\n154\n\nGAP Input Data\n\nTITLE= DEFORM El) PARABOLIC DISH\nAMP LITUUE=C ONSTAN

W. Bergmann\nNorth American Rockwell Space Division\n\nand\nJames C. Robinson and Howard M. Adelman\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThe analysis of hot structures by the finite element method poses the\nproblem of adequate structural modeling within the scope of existing computer\nprograms for severe thermal gradients and also modeling provisions for thermal\nexpansion. The paper describes an approach to the modeling and the subsequent\nanalysis of a hot elevon test article. Solutions were obtained by the ASKA\nand the NASTRAN programs to evaluate some of their performance characteristics.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe thermal environment of the Space Shuttle missions requires the design\nof major structural components either as thermally protected structures or as\nhot structures. From a series of trade and feasibility studies at the North\nAmerican Rockwell Space Division, a particular design concept for a hot\nstructure has evolved with sufficient potential to warrant its validation\nwithin the Space Shuttle Phase B Structural Test Program. For test purposes,\nthe design concept has been applied to a section of the orbiter elevon.\nIn order to determine potential weaknesses of the design concept prior\nto the test, the structural response of the test article to mechanical and\nthermal loads was analyzed by the finite element displacement method. For\ncomparison of performance characteristics of computer programs, solutions\nwere obtained for essentially similar structural models with approximately the\nsame number of degrees of freedom by both the ASKA program (ref. 1) operated\non an IBM 360/85 and by the NASTRAN program (ref. 2) operated on a CDC 6600.\nHOT ELEVON STRUCTURE\nTest Article\nThe test article is 200 cm wide and 225 cm long and varies in depth\nlinearly from 90 cm at the front to 50 cm at the rear. The overall configuration of the test article is shown in figure 1.\n\nThe structure consists basically of three ribs, a front and a rear spar,\nand sandwich-type top and bottom cover p~nels. The spars and ribs have\ncorrugated webs and welded-on caps. The cover panels are connected to the\nspar and rib caps by riveting one flange of a Z-section to the edge of the\ninside face sheet, and the other flange of the Z-section to the rib or spar\ncap. The outside face sheet bears against, but is not fastened to, the caps.\nDetails of this connection are included in figure 2.\nThe bending stiffness of the elevon is developed primarily by the rib\nand spar caps which are spliced at their intersections. Torsional stiffness\nis provided largely by the box-beam action of the rib and spar webs and the\ninside face sheets of the cover panels. The continuous connection to the caps\nand the stiffening effect of the core promote full utilization of the shear\nstiffness of the inside face sheets.\nThe ribs and spars and all Z-sections are made of Rene 41. The sandwich\npanel at the top as the elevon is mounted on the wing has 6Al-4V titanium face\nsheets and 3Al-2.5V titanium core. The bottom sandwich panel or hot surface\nconsists of Rene 41 face sheets and I nconel 625 core.\nThe external supports of the structure are provided through fittings at\nthe top and bottom cap of the center rib, and through a support at the rear\nof the center rib to prevent sidesway.\nThe design concept reduces thermal stresses by holding temperature\ndifferences in adjacent parts of the structure to a minimum and by allowing\nunconstrained thermal deformations where temperature differences cannot be\navoided. The thin outside face sheets, in particular, experience more severe\nthermal strains than the adjacent rib caps, but will deform more or less\nfreely by virtue of their floating attachment and by the presence of the\nexpansion slots indicated in figure 1.\nThermal strain compatibility between the inside face sheets of the panels\nand the more massive rib and spar caps is approached by spreading out the\nmaterial in the cap configuration and by choosing the core depth such that the\ncap and inside face sheet temperatures increase at comparable rates. The fact\nthat the cap temperatures rise slowly because of the heat sink property of the\ncaps, and that the inside face sheet temperatures tend to lag because of the\nshielding effect of the outside face sheet, is of prime importance since the\nmost severe temperature differences occur when the temperatures in caps and\nface sheets are still low, and the allowable stress levels accordingly high.\nThe flexibility of the Z-sections adds to the relief of the thermal stresses\nin the face sheets. Thermal stresses in rib and spar webs are alleviated by\nthe use of corrugations.\nAnalytical Model\nThe modeling of the structure was guided by the need to depict adequately\nthe critical aspects of the design concept with a reasonable expenditure of\ntime and effort. Ac cordingly, the hot Rene side of the structure was modeled\n164\n\nin considerable detail to investigate, in particular, the thermal-stressrelieving effect of the expansion slots, the attachment of the sandwich panels\nto the rib and spar caps, the flexing of the Z-sections, and the interact ion\nbetween the Z-sections and the caps. The similarly constructed but much cooler\ntitanium side, and the corrugated rib and spar webs, were conceived as support\nstructures for the hot side. Their idealization was attempted in relatively\ncoarse form as a series of membrane plates with flange members along their\nedges to represent the lumped rib and spar caps.\nFigure 2 shows typical cross sections of the actual structure and figure 3,\nthe idealized counterparts. Following standard practices, the face sheets of\nthe sandwich panel were represented by quadrilateral membrane elements. The\nmodeling of the core, lumped into a series of plates of equivalent thickness,\nas well as that of the corrugated webs, poses a more intricate problem. The\nindividual elements must be capable of assuming curved shapes, such as that\nassociated with pure bending, without exhibiting normal or shear stresses.\nThis requirement precludes the use of quadrilateral membrane elements composed\nof constant-strain triangles, and, hence, quadrilateral membrane elements with\nlinear stress fields were used in ASKA and rods and quadrilateral shear panels\nin NASTRAN. The bending stiffness of the idealized corrugated webs is simulated by suppressing the cap rotations about the intersections of caps and\nwebs. In the modeling of the structure, no direct advantage of symmetry was\ntaken. For simplification, however, the model was extended over only one of\nthe two bays of the structure, but the complete center rib was included. For\nthe analytical studies and the idealization shown in figure 3, the hot surface\nis the upper surface.\nBoundary Conditions\nThe external supports of the structure require that, at the front end of\nthe center rib, those translational degrees of the rib caps which do not\ninterfere with free thermal expansion, be suppressed. Therefore, the upper\ncap in figure 1 is constrained against translation in all three directions\nand the lower cap is constrained against displacement in the pl ane normal to\nthe stiffener connecting the upper and lower caps. At the rear end of the\ncenter spar, only the translation normal to the web is constrained to avoid\nsidesway under load.\nLoading Conditions\nThe loading conditions are thermal and mechanical and were applied without change of the boundary conditions. In loading case 1, the model was\nsubjected to the temperature field indicated in figure 3. The cross section\nshown is typical for both the transverse and longitudinal direction. In\nloading case 2, the outside face sheet temperature of the panel was raised\n222 K relative to the rest of the structure. Loading case 3 simulated a\nuniformly distributed pressure load on the panel. In loading case 4, a single\nconcentrated load was applied at the rear end of the center rib; and in loading\n\n165\n\ncase 5, a torsional moment was applied through two concentrated forces acting\nat the front and rear end of the outside rib.\nThe analysis was directed primarily at the response of the structure\nunder loading condition 1. For economic reasons, the material properties\nwere adjusted to these temperatures and maintained for all other loading\nconditions.\nANALYSIS BY THE ASKA PROGRAM\nThe analytical model consisted of (1) a sandwich panel with a slotted\noutside face sheet, (2) a frame combining the Z-sections and the rib and spar\ncaps, and (3) a box assembly representing the rib and spar webs and the bottom\nside of the structure. The three parts were analyzed separately as substructures and subsequently reassembled as a hyperstructure.\nFinite Element Model\nSandwich panel.- For the representation of both the face sheets and the\nlumped core, quadrilateral membrane elements with linear strain fields were\nchosen. The fineness of the nodal point grid was largely dictated by the\naspect ratio limitation of the orthotropic core elements which retained good\naccuracy up to an element length-width ratio of 8. Pertinent details and a\nCRT plot of the modeled sandwich panel are shown in figure 4.\nFrame assembly.- The frame assembly was modeled by triangular plate\nbending elements with cubic displacement fields for bending, and linear displacement fields for membrane deformations. The elements account for temperature differences through their thickness. In accordance with figure 3, only\na portion of the caps was modeled as a plate, and the other portion lumped\ninto a set of flange elements. The Z-section was simplified into an angle\nwhich is rigidly connected to the bottom of the cap. Figure 5 contains a CRT\nplot and other details of the modeled frame assembly.\nBox assembly.- In close analogy to the sandwich core representation, the\nmodeling of the corrugated rib and spar webs requires elements which can\naccommodate the extensional flexibility of such structures. Because of their\ntaper and the varying temperature between the top and bottom caps, the modeling of the corrugated webs leads to additional problems which are most readily\novercome by the use of linear-strain type quadrilaterals with orthotropic\nproperties. These elements accept linear temperature variations between\ncorner points and probably give reasonable accuracy even with relatively few\nnodal points. All of the rib and spar caps at the bottom side, including\nthe Z-sections, were lumped into flange elements. By the nature of the at t achment of the bottom sandwich panel, the inside face sheet as the major loadcarrying component of the bottom panel, is represented by quadrilateral\nmembrane elements. A CRT plot of the box assembly is shown in figure 6.\n\n166\n\nHyperstructure.- In the subsequent joining process, the webs of the box\nwere connected to the frame along the center line of the rib and spar caps,\nand the bottom face sheet of the sandwich panel to the horizontal leg of the\nframe angles. In both instances, membrane elements are tied to plate elements\nby declaring only the translations as common degrees of freedom. The top face\nsheet is not connected to the rib and spar caps. The structural stiffness\nmatrix of the hyperstructure is of order 360 and almost fully populated.\nResults\nAll ASKA computations were performed on the North American Rockwell Space\nDivision\'s IBM 360/85 system in double-precision arithmetic. The maximum core\nrequirement did not exceed 296,000 bytes.\nPreceding the analysis of the composite model, a series of test runs was\nperformed for the sandwich plate substructure to assess some of its\ncharacteristics .\nIn run 1, a temperature difference of 222 K between the face sheets of\na nonslotted panel was imposed in the absence of any boundary constraints.\nThe center deflection of the panel as determined by ASKA was 7.70 cm, which\ncompares well with the value from the exact solution of 7.73 cm. Virtually\nno normal or shear stresses occurred in any of the elements. The solution\ninvolved a stiffness matrix of order 1,150 with semibandwidth of 129, and\nrequired a total of 155 CP seconds. In run 2, the analysis was repeated after\nproviding knife-edge supports along the four edges of the panel. Even though\nthe order of the stiffness matrix was reduced to 1,094, the solution required\n164 CP seconds. Run 3 was performed after slotting the outside face sheet\nof the panel as indicated in figure 1. The additional nodal points were\ndeliberately numbered such that the semibandwidth of the resulting stiffness\nmatrix of order 1,292 increased to 1,205. The CP time for this case increased\nto 288 CP seconds. In run 4, finally, the semibandwidth was reduced to 174\nthrough an internal renumbering routine and the solution obtained in\n210 CP seconds.\nThe solution of the composite model was performed with restart provisions\nafter the reduction of each of the substructures. The complete solution,\nincluding stress printout for all loading conditions, was obtained in 1,185 CP\nseconds. Figure 7 shows a summary of the CP requirements for the major\nprocessor steps.\nThe accuracy of the solution was tested against external equilibrium\nchecks for loading conditions 4 and 5. In loading condition 4, the horizontal\nreactions at the front end of the center rib were found to deviate from the\nvalues required for equilibrium by 2.7 percent. In loading condition 5, the\nhorizontal .reactions were calculated with 0.9 percent deviation and the shear\nreaction with 0.2 percent deviation.\nFigure 8 shows typical deflections of the analytical model under loading\nconditions 4 and 5, and the defl ections calculated for the sandwich plate for\n\nloading condition 2 are depicted in figure 9. The numbers in parenthese s were\nobtained from NASTRAN; the results obtained from ASKA wil l be compared to the\nresults obtained from NASTRAN in a subsequent section.\nANALYSIS BY NASTRAN\nFinite Element Representation\nThe finite element representation used in the NASTRAN analysis is based\non that of the ASKA analysis. Substructuring capability was not available\nin NASTRAN; consequently, the complete structure was analyzed in a single\npass. However, for purposes of comparison with the ASKA model, the NASTRAN\nidealization of each of the three components will be discussed separately.\nSandwich panel.- The model of the sandwich panel is similar to that of\nfigure 4. The grid spacing is exactly twice as fine as that of figure 4\nbecause the ASKA element is a linear strain element, whereas the NASTRAN\nelement is a constant strain element, which requires a fin er grid for comparable accuracy. The face sheets are represented by constant strain quadrilateral\nmembrane element~ and the core is represented by quadrilateral shear elements\nand rod elements. The latter elements provided the stiffness against vertical\ndeformation of the core. The representation consists of 352 membrane elements,\n426 shear elements, and 258 rod elements.\nFrame assembly.- The frame assembly is modeled by triangular plate\nelements having both flexural and membrane stiffness, and by rod elements.\nThis representation is identical to that used in the ASKA model (fig. 5).\nThe plate element (CTRIA2) has first-order polynomials for the in-plane\ncomponents of displacement and a third-order polynomial for the normal component. Temperature differences through the element are not accounted for.\nThe frame representation contains 548 plate elements and 33 rod elements.\nBox assembly.- The webs of the box assembly are modeled by a combination\nof shear elements for the vertical shear members and rod elements for the\nremaining vertical members. This representation consists of 38 shear elements\nand 38 rod elements. The bottom surface of the box assembly is modeled by\n60 quadrilateral membrane elements and 33 rod elements.\nHyperstructure.- The components are joined by assigning the same grid\npoint number to points which are attached . Boundary conditions are specified\nby use of single point constraints. After application of the constraints,\nthe number of degrees of freedom in the structural model was 3179.\nResults\nAll NASTRAN computations were performed on the Langley Research Center\nCDC 6600 computing system using a core allocation of 49152 (140,000 octal)\n60-bit words. Two versions of NASTRAN were used. Level 12.1.0 is completely\n\n168\n\nin double precision and level 11.1.2, a nonstandard CD C 6600 version, use s\nsingle precision arithmetic, except in the stif fness matrix generation, where\ndouble precision is used.\nA test run, similar to run 1 described i n the ASKA discussion, was made\nwith NASTRAN for a temperature difference of 222 K a cros s t he unslotted. sandwich panel. The center deflection obtained by NASTRAN was 7.87 cm. This\ncompared well with the prediction by ASKA of 7.70 cm and the exact solution of\n7.73 cm. The finite element model had 1234 degrees of freedom and the solution required 360 central processor (CP) seconds using level 11.1. 2 and\n440 CP seconds using level 12.l.O.\n\nThe solution of the complete elevon model was performed in one pass. The\nresults for the reaction forces were checked by a simple static force balance\non a desk calculator and were correct to at least five significant figures.\nSome results of the NASTRAN analysis are shown (in parentheses) along with the\nASKA results in figures 8 and 9.\nSome deformations of the elevon for load case 5 shown in figure 8(b)\nagree reasonably well with the ASKA results at the rib and spar intersections,\nbut appear to differ appreciably at the ends of the ribs. The deformations of\nthe upper surface of the sandwich panel for load case 2 are shown in figure 9,\nIn this case, the difference between the ASKA and NASTRAN results at the point\nof maximum deformation is about 12 percent. The reasons for the difference\nbetween the two solutions had not been determined at the time of publicat i on\nof this paper, but it is felt that some difference existed in the models as\na result of converting the input data from ASKA to NASTRAN.\nThe total computer central processor time required for the analysis of\nthe complete elevon structure using NASTRAN level 11.1.2 was 2,zr6 seconds.\nThe time required for each of the major steps is shown in figure 10. The\ntotal time of 1868 CP seconds (exclusive of the 408 seconds required for\nplotting) is roughly half again as much as the 1185 seconds required for the\nASKA solution. The two analyses were run on different computers, which\ncertainly has some influence on a Jirect time comparison. However, it appears\nthat for the problem studied herein, ASKA was appreciably faster, perhaps\nbecause of its substructuring capability. It is, therefore, felt that this\ncapability would be a desirable addition to NASTRAN.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nA static analysis was performed by both the ASKA computer program and\nNASTRAN to determine the deformation of a space shuttle hot elevon test article\nunder thermal and mechanical loads. Detailed comparisons were made between\nrunning times of the two programs and also between results predicted by the\ntwo programs.\n\nIn general, the results from the two programs are in reasonably good\nagreement (with differ ences on t h e order of 12 percent) , although some great er\n\ndiscrepancies were noted. At publication time, the reasons for the differences have not been ascertained. It is felt, however, that small undetected\nerrors may have accrued in the process of converting the input data from the\nASKA format to that of NASTRAN.\nThe results of this study suggest that the substructuring capability of\nASKA is helpful in reducing run time which justifies the current NASA plans\nto include this capability in NASTRAN.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nSchrem, E.; and Roy, J.

The normal modes of a single component are synthesized to\nrepresent different single-component and multi-component structures. The results are compared for\naccuracy with the analytic structural solutions. Guidelines for finite-element structural modeling are\ndeveloped which determine the minimum number of elements required to obtain specified levels of\naccuracy in normal-mode analysis and synthesis. The finite-element modeling studies are implemented\non NASA\'s NASTRAN structural analysis computer program. Modeling techniques that represent a\npart of a structure by its normal modes in a computer structural analysis are presented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nProblem Statement\nThe normal-mode method of structural analysis has been developed into a powerful tool in the\nanalysis of large and complex aerospace structures. The value of this method lies in the fact that the\nsimultaneous differential equations of motion which describe the linear dynamic characteristic of a\nstructure are decoupled into independent differential equations when the displacements are expressed\nin terms of the normal modes. A normal or natural mode of vibration occurs when each point in the\nstructure executes harmonic motion about a point of static equilibrium, with every point passing\nthrough its equilibrium position at the same instant and reaching its maximum displacement at the\nsame instant. The form of the displacement of a structure is known as the normal-mode shape, and\nthe frequency of the harmonic motion is known as the normal-mode frequency. Additionally, normalmode shapes and frequencies are used to compute the modal properties of generalized mass, stiffness,\nand structural damping associated with the modes. NASA has prepared a general review and useful\n181\n\nbibliography of normal-mode analysis (Reference 1). Application of this method of analysis to space\nvehicles and a bibliography of both analytical and applied references are presented in References 2, 3,\nand 4.\nThere are basically two numerical methods of approach to the problem of determining the normal modes of structural systems: An exact problem formulation solved approximately and an approximate formulation solved exactly. For certain simple systems the exact solution for normal modes can\nbe obtained by analytical methods. For \xc2\xb7complex structures, an approximate model of the problem\ndefined by finite elements can be solved for an exact solution by using digital computers.\nThe technique of normal-mode synthesis is a process whereby the dynamic characteristics of the\nseveral components of the system are calculated separately and then brought together to evaluate the\ndynamic characteristics of the entire system, thereby increasing computer efficiency. Another major\nadvantage of the normal-mode-synthesis technique is that the modal data may come from such diverse\nsources as analytic solutions, finite-element analyses, and vibration tests designed to determine normal\nmodes. Thus, one structural analysis using modal synthesis can incorporate the representation of individual substructures analyzed by completely different techniques by separate engineering groups that\nmay never have conferred about the complete structure.\nThe concept of modal synthesis is founded on the principle that a substructure is completely ( or\nadequately) represented by its primary modes; if this is true, then the connections of these substructures at their interfaces can be described in terms of the modal quantities of the components. A set of\nequations can be written with coordinates in terms of normal-mode shapes and modal factors of the\ncomponents. Solving these equations for the amplitude factors and multiplying by the component\nmodes yields system modes.\nSeveral investigators have developed complete methods of analysis by substructures; these methods incorporate the concept of normal-mode synthesis. Gladwell (Reference 5) developed the branch\nmode method of vibration analysis, which involves the imposition of a sequence of constraints on the\nsystem so that in each constrained system or branch only a few adjoining components vibrate in\nmodes, called branch modes. These branch modes and appropriate rigid-body modes are used in a\nRayleigh-Ritz analysis of the complete system. Craig and Bampton (Reference 6) extended the branch\nmode method to systems having highly r~dundant substructure boundaries.\nHurty (References 7 and 8) presented the method of component-mode synthesis in which the vibration modes of the composite structure are synthesized from generalized coordinates that are defined\nby a finite number of displacement mod es for each component structure. These displacement modes\nare generated in three categories: Rigid-body, "constraint" modes, and "normal" modes.\nMacNeal (Reference 9) devised a general solution to the problem of representing a part of a structure by its vibration modes when some or all of its connection points to the rest of the structure are\nrestrained during measurement or calculation of substructure modes. This procedure is incorporated\nin the present study.\nIn this report the basis of normal-mode analysis and normal-mode synthesis is presented and modeling studies using finite elements and modal synthesis for structural problems are evolved, performed\n182\n\non NASTRAN* (Reference 10), and compared to known analytic solutions for accuracy. The purpose\nof these studies is threefold:\n( 1) To compare the results of the normal-mode solutions of structural problems analyzed by\nfinite-element and other methods for accuracy.\n(2) To develop guidelines for efficient finite-element modeling so that required accuracies will\nresult from the analysis.\n(3) To investigate modeling techniques in representing a part of a structure by its normal modes\nas implemented on a structural-analysis computer program.\n\nMETHOD OF ANALYSIS\nNormal-Mode Analysis\nIn the normal-mode or modal method of dynamic problem formulation, the vibration modes of\nthe structure in a selected frequency range are used as.the degrees of freedom. Thus the number of\ndegrees of freedom is reduced while the accuracy in the selected frequency range is maintained. In the\ndirect method, the degrees of freedom are simply the displacements at connection points between\nsubstructures.\nThe advantage of the normal-mode method lies in the fact that the differential equations of motion of the structure are decoupled when the displacements are expressed in terms of the normal\nmodes. Thus, a structure with n degrees of freedom may be expressed by n independent differential\nequations rather than by a system of n simultaneous differential equations.\nThe modal method of dynamic problem formulation is important in maximization of computational efficiency in certain types of problems. This method will usually be more efficient in problems\nwhere a small fraction of the modes are sufficient to produce the desired accuracy in the range of interest and where the stiffness matrix used in the direct method is not well banded. For problems without dynamic coupling, i.e., for problems in which the matrices of the modal formulation are diagonal,\nthe modal method will frequently be more efficient, even though a large fraction of the modes are\nneeded (Reference 10).\nEigenvalue Analysis\nEigenvalue analysis yields structural vibration modes from the symmetric mass and stiffness matrices, [Maa] and [Kaa], generated by static analysis. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues produced by this\nanalysis may be used t o generate modal coordinates for further dynamic analysis.\nThe general form of the eigenvalue problem for vibration modes is\n(1)\n*NAsa STRuctural ANalysis.\n\nw;\n\nwhere {u0 } is the displacement vector and the eigenvalues Xi =\nare the squares of the natural frequencies. The results of the calculation are the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, {\xc2\xa20 J, normalized so that the largest element of each eigenvector is unity.\nThe eigenvalue extraction method used in the present analysis is called the inverse power method\nwith shifts, a particularly effective method of analysis for problems formulated by the displacement\napproach when only a fraction of all of the eigenvalues are required. Section 10.4 of Reference 10\ngives a complete description of the theory and application of this method as implemented in\nNASTRAN.\nNormal-Mode Synthesis\nThe normal-mode synthesis technique in structural analysis permits part of a structure to be described by its orthogonal vibration modes. In some instances structural information may not be available in other forms. Thus, normal-mode information derived from diverse sources, including vibration\ntests and other analyses such as energy methods and finite elements, may be combined in one structural analysis. Normal-mode synthesis has been found useful in many practical situations (Reference 2).\nSection 14.1 of Reference 10 develops the modeling technique utilized in the present study,\nwhereby a part of a structure is represented by its vibrational modes. This development is summarized\nbelow.\nDescription of part of a structure by vibration modes requires knowledge of how the connection\npoints between parts of the structure were supported when the vibration modes were measures or\ncomputed. Three cases are distinguished:\n( 1) All connection coordinates free.\n(2) All connection coordinates restrained.\n(3) Some connection coordinates free and some restrained.\nThe first conditi_ n is usually employed in vibration tests or analyses of large parts. Often it is\no\nnot possible to achieve effectively unrestrained test conditions; however, unrestrained conditions can\nbe obtained from calculated modes. For Case 1, the required data are the vibration mode frequencies ,\nwi, the mode shapes of eigenvec.tors, j \xc2\xa2i} , and the mass distribution of the part, expressed by the\nmass matrix [MP]. The eigenvectors need not be normalized in any particular manner. Let the degrees\nof freedom at the points of connection to the remainder of the structure be designated by the vector\nl Then the motions of these points are related to the modal coordinates, l ~i} , of the part by\n\nuJ.\n\n(2)\n\nThe columns of [\xc2\xa2cil are the eigenvectors, {\xc2\xa2i}\' abbreviated to include only the degrees of freedom at\nthe connection points, {uc}. The usual approximation of including only a finite number of eigenvectors\nin [ \xc2\xa2 ci] produces an idealized model for the part that is too stiff. Specification of the part is completed\n\n184\n\nby calculation of the generalized mass, mi, stiffness, ki, and damping, bi, associated with each modal\ncoordinate, t;, as follows:\nm; ={\xc2\xa2;}T[Mp]{<P;},\n\n(3)\n\nki = w;m;,\n\n(4)\n\nbi= gimiwi,\n\n(5)\n\nand\nwhere gi is a damping factor for the ith mode. Frequently gi will not be accurately known.\nThe equation of motion for the generalized coordinate, t;, is\n(mip2\n\n+ bip + k;)t; = {\xc2\xa2ci}T{fc}\'\n\n(6)\n\nwhere p is the differential operator, {fJ is the vector of forces applied to the substructure at the connection points, and {\xc2\xa2ci} is the eigenvector {\xc2\xa2i} abbreviated to include only the degrees of freedom at\nconnection points.\nEquations (2) through (6) contain all of the information required to describe the part. In the\nconstruction of the idealized model, each of the rows of Equation (2) is regarded as an equation of\nconstraint between a constrained degree of freedom, uc, and the generalized coordinates, {ti}. The\ngeneralized mass, stiffness, and damping elements connected to ti are m;, ki , and bi , respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the interconnection of the elements in diagrammatic form.\nThe derivation of an idealized model for Cases 2 and 3, in which some or all of the connection\npoints are restrained during measurement or calculation of the substructure modes, is considerably\nmore involved. A general solution devised by MacNeal (References 9 and 10) is developed in Section\n14.1 of Reference 10.\nMODELING STUDIES\nNormal-Mode\nDescription\nThe structural problem chosen to compare the accuracy of solutions obtained by different methods is the determina_\ntion of the normal modes of vibration of a constant-property beam with various\nend conditions. Vibration transverse to the axis of the beam is considered in only one plane. Damping and axial vibration are neglected.\nThe analytic method for the determination of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of a\nbeam and a detailed derivation of the corresponding characteristic functions are given in standard\ntexts (References 11 and 12) on structural dynamics. Young and Felgar (Reference 13) tabulated the\nsolution of the characteristic functions of this problem, with vibrations governed by the well known\ndifferential equation\n(7)\n\nwhere x and y are the coordinates parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the longitudinal axis of\nthe beam; tis time; Eis the modulus of elasticity; I is the moment of inertia; and p is the mass per\nunit length of the beam. Each of the functions for a given beam satisfies the differential equation\n(8)\n\nand also satisfies the boundary conditions corresponding to the end conditions of the beam. In\nEquation (8) ~n is the characteristic number and </>n (x) is the characteristic function for each type of\nbeam. The natural circular frequency of the nth mode of vibration of the beam, wn, is given by\nW\n\nn\n\n= ~2 . @ = (~\nn\n\nVP\n\nn\n\n/)2\n\n@\nVpz4,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere l is the length of the beam. These results are assumed to be the "known" solution to which the\nfinite-element results are compared for accuracy.\nThe specific element used in the present modeling study is identified in NASTRAN by the\nmnemonic, CBAR, denoting the "connection, bar" element (Figure 2) that undergoes extension, torsion, bending in two perpendicular planes, and the associated shears. Section 5.2 of Reference 10 presents the detailed analytic description of this finite element.\nThe uniform beam is represented by four different finite-element models consisting of 5, 10, 20,\nand 40 elements, respectively, to ascertain the effect of the number of elements upon the accuracy of\nre~;ults. For ease in correlation of finite-element and differential equation results, beam proper~ies\nwere chosen to reduce to 1 the value of the terms within the radical in the second expression for w in\nEquation (9). Figure 3 shows the four beam models. Thus, the natural frequency in radians per second of the nth mode resulting from the eigenvalue analysis of the finite-element formulation is directly\ncomparable to the term (~n !) 2 of Equation (9) as tabulated in Reference 13 for various beam types.\nFree, supported , and clamped beam end conditions are combined to obtain six different types of\nbeams: (1) Free-free, (2) free-supported, (3) free-clamped, (4) supported-supported, (5) supportedclamped, and (6) clamped-clamped.\nImplementation\nThe normal-mode modeling study is implemented on the NASTRAN computer program, Release\n11.1, which is operational on the IBM System 360/95 at Goddard Space Flight Center. NASTRAN\nembodies a lumped-element approach, whereby the distributed physical properties of a structure are\nrepresented by a model consisting of a finite number of idealized substructures or elements that are\ninterconnected at a finite number of grid points, to which loads are applied. All inputs and outputs\npertain to the idealized structural model.\nThe structural problem is defined by encoding the coordinate-system definition (CORD2R)*,\n*NASTRAN mnemoni cs.\n\n186\n\ngrid-point definition (GRID), element connections (CBAR), element property and materials (PBAR,\nMAT I), and method of eigenvalue extraction (EIG R), as prescribed by Reference 14.\nThe problem thus defined undergoes eigenvalue analysis using the inverse power method with\nshifts, which computes the following for each of the modes analyzed: eigenvalue, eigenvector normalized to the maximum displacement, natural frequency in radians per second and cycles per second,\ngeneralized stiffness, and generalized mass.\nNormal-Mode Synthesis\nGeneral\nThe results.of the normal-mode analysis provide a basis for solution of the following problems by\nsynthesis of the normal modes of the constituent parts, i.e., by representing a part of a structure by\nits vibration modes. The eigenvectors and generalized properties of the first i modes of the beam with\nfree-free end conditions are used in the application of the theory developed earlier for normal-mode\nsynthesis.\nSingle-Component Structure\nThe structural problem chosen to demonstrate the synthesis of normal modes and to investigate\nthe accuracy of the technique is the determination of the normal modes of a uniform cantilevered\nbeam, i.e., a beam with fixed-free end conditions. The beam consists of a single component modeled\nby the modal properties of a beam with free-free end conditions. The first i free-free normal modes\nare selected to model the beam, where i must include the first two modes that are rigid-body modes.\nThe generalized stiffness given by Equation (4) is zero for rigid-body modes since the natural frequency is zero. The various values of i selected include the two rigid-body modes plus arbitrarily selected flexible modes. The source of the modal information is the four finite-element models used in\nthe normal-mode analysis, which consisted of 5, l 0, 20, and 40 elements, respectively. Thus, for example, in the IO-element model the first i modes were used, where i = 3, 5, 6, 9, and 11. The following section presents the numerical results and compares them to known solutions for the modes of the\ncantilevered beam.\nImplementation of the normal-mode synthesis on the NASTRAN program requires the declaration of the following for each mode used to model the structural part: (1) Scalar point (SPOINT),\nwhich is a point in vector space at which one degree of freedom is defined, (2) scalar mass (CMASS4)\nand stiffness connection (CELAS4) elements whose values are the generalized mass and stiffness, and\n(3) the coefficients of the matrix [\xc2\xa2ci] of Equation (2), the columns of which are the eigenvectors of\nthe ith mode, truncated to include only the degrees of freedom at the connection points. The scalar\npoints become the generalized coordinates and degrees of freedom for the analysis. The relationship\ngiven by Equation (2) is declared in NASTRAN by a multipoint constraint equation (MPC).\nSimulation of restrained end conditions of the beam is most easily accomplished by the connection of a spring (CELAS2) of very large spring constant, e.g., l 0 12 N/m (10 10 lb/in .), at the connec-\n\ntion points between ground and the restrained degrees of freedom. Figure 4 shows a representation of\nthe model used for normal-mode synthesis of a single cantilevered beam.\nMultiple-Component Structures\nThe modeling techniques described for a single-component structure are extended to structures\nwith multiple components. In each problem formulation, the required modal information for each\nsubstructure is identical to that required in the preceding structure. Boundary conditions of the\nmultiple-substructure problem are handled in the same manner as the end conditions of a singleelement cantilever beam. Connections between adjoining substructures are made by declaring a scalar\nspring element (CELAS2) with a very large spring constant between appropriate translational and rotational degrees of freedom.\nStructural normal modes are obtained by the normal-mode-synthesis technique as applied to the\nfollowing structures, each divided into more than one substructure: (1) Three beams in series, cantilevered, (2) three beams in parallel, cantilevered, and (3) three beams in a portal arch. Figure 5 shows\nsketches of these structures. The next section presents the comparison of the results of the modeling\nstudy and the known solution as given by Equation (9) for the first and second structures and by a\n120-finite-element model for the third structure.\n\nANALYSIS OF MODELING STUDIES\nNormal-Mode Analysis\nValues and units for the parameters required for the finite-element models described in the\nprevious section are chosen as follows:\n\nModulus of elasticity\n\nE = 6.9 X 10 11 N/m 2 (10 8 lb/in. 2 ).\n\nPoisson\'s ratio\n\nV\n\nMass per unit length\n\np =\n\nArea moments of inertia\n\n= 0.3.\n\n6.9 X 10 3 N-sec 2/m 2 (1.0 lb-sec 2 /in. 2 ).\n\n11, 2 = 41.6 cm 4 (1.0 in. 4 ).\n\nCross-sectional area\n\nA= 6.5 cm 2 (1.0 in. 2 ).\n\nTorsional constant\n\nJ\n\nLength\n\n= 41.6 cm4 (1.0 in. 4 ).\nl = 254 cm (100 in.).\n\nThus, the four models of the uniform beam consist of 5, 10, 20, and 40 bar elements, whose elemental lengths are 50.8, 25.4, 12.7, and 6.4 cm (20, 10, 5, and 2.5 in), respectively (Figure 3). As\npreviously stated, this choice of parameter values permits direct comparison of the results of the eigenvalue analysis with those tabulated in Reference 13.\n\n188\n\nThe complete matrix of problems studied consists of the four finite-element models solved for\neach of the six end conditions: ( 1) Free-free, (2) free-supported, (3) free-clamped, (4) supportedsupported, (5) supported-clamped, and (6) clamped-clamped. Table I lists the numerical results of the\neigenvalue analysis for the free-free end condition; Reference 15 records the numerical results for the\nremaining five conditions. Recorded data include(1) Mode number, i = 1, 2, 3, ... 20.\n\n(2) Natural circular frequency of the ith mode of vibration of the beam in radians per second for\nthe known solution given in Reference 13.\n(3) Accuracy, A, defined as the ratio of the finite-element solution to the known solution. This\ndefinition of accuracy shall be maintained throughout the analysis of results.\nIn general, if n is the number of unrestrained, independent degrees of freedom of the problem,\nthen n normal modes exist. For example, six grid points are required to model the 5-element beam.\nFor the free-free type beam, n = 6. These consist of two rigid-body modes and four flexible modes.\nSupporting one end of the beam reduces n by one and results in one rigid-body mode and four flexible\nmodes. Clamping one end prohibits rigid-body motion. In Table I, only flexible modes are recorded.\nTable I-Uniform beam with free-free end conditions.\n\xc2\xb7-\n\nMode\nnumber\n\nI\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nFrequency\nof known\nsolution\n(rad/sec)\n22.373\n61.673\n120.90\n199.86\n298.56\n416.99\n555.16\n713.08\n890.73\n1088.1\n1305.3\n1542.1\n1798.7\n2075.1\n2371.2\n2687.0\n3022.6\n3377.9\n3752.9\n4147.7\n\nAccuracy, A\nN=5\n\nN= 10\n\nN = 20\n\nN=40\n\n0.893\n.838\n.796\n.734\n\n0.970\n.951\n.933\n.916\n.900\n.883\n.857\n.815\n.743\n\n0.992\n.987\n.982\n.977\n.972\n.967\n.962\n.957\n.951\n.945\n.939\n.930\n.919\n.905\n.886\n.860\n.826\n.783\n.730\n\n0.998\n.997\n.995\n.994\n.993\n.992\n.990\n.989\n.988\n.986\n.985\n.983\n.982\n.980\n.979\n.977\n.975\n.973\n.971\n.969\n\n189\n\nFigure 6, a representative of the data recorded for the six end conditions, shows the normal-mode\nresults for modes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 15 of the free-free type of beam. The coordinates of the figure\nare the number of finite elements in the model, N, versus the accuracy, A, of modal frequency, defined above. In general, accuracy approaches 1.0 asymptotically from below as the number of elements increases. The plot passes through the origin, since zero finite elements result in zero accuracy.\nThis relationship is expressed by\nN\n\n= tan [Af(i , c)] ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere N is the number of elements in the model, f(i, c)"is a function of the mode number, i, and c is\nan angular constant.\nEquation (10) can be used to estimate the number of finite elements required to model the beam\nfor selected values of mode number, i, desired minimum accuracy, A, and beam end conditions. For\nexample, for the beam with free-free end conditions, when\n\nN> i + 2,\n\n(11)\n\nthese parameters determined by curve-fitting the empirical data are defined as\nf(i,\n\nand\n\nC)\n\n=C + i\n\n(12)\n\nc = 87 .7 deg.\n\nFor A = 0. 90 and i = 2, Equation ( 10) yields N\nThis estimate is verified by Figure 6.\n\n= 6.1 ; when rounded to the next highest integer, N = 7.\n\nA comparison of accuracies for both mode numbers and finite-element models as recorded in\nTable 1 reveals a general trend in the accuracy of the finite-element solution. For a specific mode\nnumber or for a specific number of finite elements in the beam model, a reduction in the degrees of\nfreedom at the ends of the beam results in increased accuracy of the solution. This observation is explained by the fact that a decrease in freedom of the structure at the boundary requires a given number of elements to describe less complex displacements in the eigenvector, i.e., less difference in the\nend displacements of individual elements. Therefore, Equations (10), (11 ), and (12), when applied to\nbeams with increased end fixity, represent overestimates of the minimum number of elements that will\nyield specified accuracies in the eigenvalue solution.\n\nNormal-Mode Synthesis\nSingle-Component Structure\nNumerical results of the single-component problem discussed earlier are shown in Figure 6. They\ncorrespond to the 5-, 10-, 20-, and 40-element beam models, respectively, used as sources of the substructure normal modes. The normal modes are computed for free-free end conditions. The first i\nmodes are used to model the substructure. Data shown in Figure 6 include the number of normal\nmodes, i, used to synthesize the model, the known solution, and the accuracy, A, of the modal fre190\n\nquency defined as the ratio of the synthesized result to the known solution, as in the normal-mode\nanalysis.\nRepresentative data are shown in Figure 7a, which plots i versus A for the first , second , third , and\nfifth modal frequencies of the uniform cantilevered beam. Curves are included for the normal-mode\nsource beams consisting of 5, 10, 20, and 40 elements.\nFigure 7 b shows the effect of varying i to represent a substructure in a plot of i versus A for modal\ndata for the normal-mode source model consisting of 20 finite elements.\nThe following generalizations are drawn from the plotted data for this structure modeled by\ncomponent modts:\n(1) There is nearly constant accuracy in modal frequency for the i - 2 modes where the first i\n\nnormal modes are used to represent the substructure.\n(2) Accuracy of modes i and i - l are extremely poor, i.e., inaccurate by more than an order of\nmagnitude.\n(3) For the minimum number of synthesized normal modes used to model the substructure, best\naccuracy for a specific normal mode, i\', of the structure is obtained when i = i\' + 2. Thus, for a specific i\', a nontruncated set of normal modes represents a substructure more accurately than does a\ntruncated set of modes.\nMultiple-Component Structures\nThe several problems described in the earlier section exercise the normal-mode-synthesis technique\nfor structures with more than one separable substructure.\nEach structure is composed of three uniform beams previously discussed and analyzed by the\nnormal-mode method. Each component beam is represented by the first 12 normal modes, i.e., two\nrigid-body modes and 10 flexible modes evaluated by the 40-element beam analysis for free-free end\nconditions. The 40-element source beam produces the most accurate results, therefore it is used to\nminimize error in the component modes. Stiffness connection elements (CELAS2), i.e., springs with\nvery large spring constants, are used to couple the degrees of freedom of the substructures that are\nunrestrained when their normal modes are computed. Similarly, these fictitious springs provide the\nmeans to fix boundary conditions by connecting the appropriate degrees of freedom to ground.\nThe first structure studied is a cantilevered beam whose length is 3!, composed of three uniform\nsegments, each l in length, in series (see Figure 5). Substitution of 3! for l in Equation (9) yields the\nknown solution for modal frequency. Reference 15 presents the known solutions and the accuracy ,\nA, of normal-mode-synthesis results as a function of the number of modes, i, used to model each component; Figure 8 shows these data plotted as i versus A for representative normal modes of the complete structure. The curves approach an accuracy of 1.0 asymptotically from above as the number of\nnormal modes synthesized for the substructures increases. The accuracy of the synthesized-structure\nmodal frequency varies over a narrow range of values for modes numbered from 1 to nearly 2i. For\nexample, when seven modes are used to model each substructure, accuracy of the modal frequency\n191\n\nvaries between 1.07 and 1.16 for all the structural modes numbered from 1 to 15. The model frequencies are inaccurate by an order of magnitude for structural modes greater than 2i. As i increases, the\nrange of values for A narrows and approaches 1.0. Reasonable engineering accuracy, e.g., within 10\npercent, is obtained by use of a moderate number of component modes in the model. For example,\n10-percent accuracy is obtained in the first mode when i = 6 and in the second mode when i = 7. When\ni = 12, all of the first 20 modes of the structure are computed with less than 10-percent error.\nFor the second structure, three parallel beams are fixed at one end and connected at the other.\nTable 2 gives data similar to that for the preceding structure. The known solution is the same as that\nfor the single cantilevered beam, since the 3\'s cancel in the numerator and denominator of the term\nwithin the radical of Equation (9). Connections between con:iponents are made by the technique\ndiscussed for the previous structure. Normal-mode synthesis yields three computed modes corresponding to each mode of a single cantilevered beam. In the first synthesized mode all three parallel beams\nmove in the same characteristic mode. In each of the other two synthesized modes, two beams move\nin the same cantilevered mode, while the third parallel beam takes a different mode shape. Good accuracy in modal frequency is obtained for structural modes in which each of the three components are\ncharacterized by the same substructure mode. This problem formulation demonstrates the ability of\n\nTable 2-Normal-mode synthesis of three parallel beams fixed at one end and mutually connected\nat their other ends.

Here the fictitious springs connect the appropriate degrees of freedom (see\nFigure 5). Rotations at the ends of adjoining beams are connected to maintain continuity of displacement between substructures. Transverse displacements at the top of the two vertical-support beams\nare connected, since longitudinal extension of the horizontal beam is neglected. Table 3 tabulates\nthe following data for this structure: The known solution for normal modes, the mode number and\ntype with respect to symmetry, and the accuracy, A, of the normal-mode-synthesis technique. The\nresults of a finite-element, normal-mode analysis are assumed to be the known solutions. This model\nconsists of 40 bar elements for each of the three constituent beams. Accuracy is poor for the first\nsymmetric and antisymmetric modes, i.e., approximately 55-percent error. However, accuracy improves with higher mode numbers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this report, the bases in finite-element analysis of the normal-mode method and the normalmode-synthesis technique were presented and their features, applications, and implementation with\nNASTRAN were discussed. A normal-mode modeling study of a uniform beam resulted in guidelines\nfor prediction of accuracy in analysis compared to a known solution for the problem. Modal data\nfrom this modeling study were used to represent substructures in a modeling study of the normalmode synthesis. One single-component structure and three multiple-component structures demonstrated normal-mode synthesis and its modeling techniques as implemented on NASTRAN.\nThe limited examples treated in the present study are intended to investigate accuracy obtained\nby the analyses and to demonstrate the application of these techniques on NASTRAN. Accuracy\n\n193\n\nguidelines can be applied judiciously to similar structures, e.g., tapered beams. Though normal modes\nmay be synthesized from many diverse sources, the analyst should be cautioned to use extreme care in\ndynamic partitioning techniques, especially when truncating the modes used to represent a substructure.\nThe selection of an adequate number of finite elements needed to model a structure yields good\naccuracy in the solution obtained by normal-mode analysis. The synthesis of components represented\nby their normal modes yields more accurate results for the entire structure when the component\nmodes are characteristic of the modal contribution of the substructure than when these modes are not\ncharacteristic of the modal contributions. Further study of the reason for the less accurate results\nmay lead to a better understanding of the general applications and limitations of normal-mode synthesis.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Archer, J.

Evaluations are made of eigenvalue accuracy\nwith respect to the relative numbers of retained indicator degrees of freedom.\nWhen a relatively small number of indicator degrees of freedom are employed,\nsolutions are likely to be inaccurate unless prior knowledge of the mode sh a pes\nis used in sele cting these degrees of freedom.\nOne improvement for recovering the lowest modes is to supplement\nthe indicator displacements with static loading displacement functions. A further, and more powerful remedy is to perform iterative repetitions of the\nsolution procedure by extending Stodola\' s method of matrix iteration, which\noperates with one eigenvector at a time, to a block iteration operating on a\ngroup of vectors simultaneously. This de-emphasizes the need for a judicious\nselection of indicators, since it is shown that an arbitrary selection of n indicators will eventually produce solutions that converge to n exact modal solutions. Great improvements in accuracy can be achieved with only a few iterative cycles and relatively small numbers of retained degrees of freedom.\nThis method is effective when only a few valid modal solutions are required\nand the order of the matrix is so l a rge that the computational time without reduction would ordinarily be prohibitive.\n\nCONVENTIONAL CONDENSATION METHODS\n\nProcedures to condense the order of the eigenvalue problem solution\nfor structural analysis are frequently useq for computa tional efficiency and\neconomy. As an exa mple, the well known Guyan reduction (ref. 1) procedure,\nwhich is incorporat ed within NAST RAN, is particularly attractive whenever\nth e order of the s y s t e m of e quati o ns to be solv ed is large and the soluti on is\n*This paper p r e sents the results of one phase of rese a rch c a rried out a t th e\nJet Propul s ion L a b o rato r y, C a lifornia Institute of Techno logy, un d e r Contr a ct No. NAS 7-100, sponsor e d by th e National Aerona utics and Spac e\nA d ministr a ti o n.\n201\n\nrequired for only a relatively small number of natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes. Equivalent conventional procedures are de scribed in\nreferences 2 and 3.\nWith a discrete idealization of the structure, the order of the eigenvalue solution needs to be only as large as the number of degrees of freedom\nwith non- zero entries in the mass matrix. The number of elastic degrees of\nfreedom is given by the order of the stiffness or flexibility matrix, and is\nequal to or greater than the mass degrees of freedom. Therefore, because\nthe size of the eigenvalue problem depends upon the size of the mass matrix,\ncondensation procedures have been referred to as mass matrix reduction\nmethods. Although specific descriptions and details of implementations vary,\nconventional approaches to condensation could often be considered as RayleighRitz approximation techniques (ref. 4). These are employed in solving the\nfollowing homogeneous system of N equations for the unknown displacements\n\n{x }:\n\n[M] {x} + [K] {x}\n\n{o}\n\n=\n\n(1)\n\nwhere [M] is the mass matrix and [K] is the stiffness matrix. The solution\nfurnishes the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues, which are\nmeasures of the modal natural frequencies.\nA reduction in the order of the system from N to L ( L < N) can be\neffected by the transformation\n\n{x}\n\n=\n\n[Y] {s}\n\n( 2)\n\nwhere [ y] is an assumed transformation matrix of order N X L and { S} is a\nset of generalized coordinates associated with the transformation. This reduces the order of the problem to L, and the equations to be solved are\n\n[M] {~} + [K] {s}\n\n=\n\n0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n(3a)\n\nand\n\n(3b)\n\n202\n\nThe solution to equation (3) produces the eigenvalues and the modal\nmatrix of eigenvectors [ cp associated with the set of generalized coordinates.\nThe set of L eigenvectors of order N for the original system can be recovered\nfrom\n\nJ\n\n[x]\n\n=\n\n[y] (cp]\n\n( 4)\n\nThe transformation matrix, which is the key to the procedure, can be\nconsidered as a set of L N-component vectors, with each vector equivalent to\nan assumed displacement function. The approximation of the solution depends\nupon how closely the assumed displacement functions (or linear combinations\nof them) agree with the actual eigenvectors. Whenever a displacement function is the true eigenvector, the resulting solution for the corresponding mode\nwill be exact. Nevertheless, it is one of the advantages of the Rayleigh-Ritz\nmethod that the approximations of the solution tend to be less severe than the\napproximations of the assumed functions. On \xc2\xb7the other hand, there is no\nassurance that gross inaccuracies will not occur as a result of unfavorable\nchoices for the transformation matrix.\nA simple way to generate a set of displacement functions for the\ntransformation matrix is to make a selection of a set of L "indicator" degrees\nof freedom, and then to develop static displacement vectors consistent with\neither unit displacements (ref. 1) or unit loads (refs. 2 and 3) at each indicator. Whether displacements or loads should be used to gene rate the displace ment functions is theoretically immaterial; the logical choice depends upon\nconvenience of execution for the available software. Consequently, the major\nrequirement in proceeding with a condensed solution is the selection of suitable indicator degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, only a minute amount of\nguidance is available to assist in the selection, and even this guidance is of\nquestionable value. Possible guidelines are the following:\n1.\n\nSelect the degrees of freedom that have the largest entries in the\nmass matrix.\n\n2.\n\nSelect the degrees of freedom that have the largest movements\n(components of the eigenvector) in the modes of interest.\n\nThe first guideline can be defended in the limiting case: when the\nmagnitude of one particular mass is overwhelming with respect to the sums of\nthe magnitudes of the remaining masses, the system is then essentially\nequivalent to one uncoupled degree of freedom for each elastic degree of freedom at the predominant mass. There is no clear defense for this guideline 1n\nthe very practical and common case in which there is no single mass that\npredominates.\nThe second guideline allows the solution to develop good approximations to the true eigenvectors by means of linear combinations of the\n\n203\n\nindicator -gene rated displacement functions. The principle is clearly sound,\nbut successful application depends upon knowing part of the answer in advance. In the case of regular classical structures, such as beams or strings,\nthe true mode shapes are well known and the application is clear. However,\nfor practical structures of irregular geometry and properties, identification\nof the important degrees of freedom approaches guesswork. Therefore, success can depend upon chance.\n\nACCURACY TESTS OF CONVENTIONAL METHOD\n\nThe accuracy of condensed solutions was assessed for the analytical\nmodels of two structures used in the field of radar antennas. These particular models are of interest because they represent practical illustrations of\nirregular structures, and depart considerably from classic al examples.\nThe first model is of an experimental structure built to simulate a\n30-deg sector of a 26-m-diameter reflector. Its framing is shown in figure 1. The structure mass is about 2400 kg and consists of structural steel\ntees and angles. The reflecting surface comprises an additional 360 kg of\nnon-structural panels supported on the top chords of the trusses. Joint connections were idealized as pinned, with the exception of a few cases in which\nrelatively stiff members were continuous across the joints. The mass matrix\nfor the full model represents 190 translational degrees of freedom. The order\nof the stiffness matrix is slightly larger because of a few rotational degrees\nof freedom.\nThe second model is of the pedestal that provides the support and\ndriving mechanism for the polar wheel of a 26-m-diameter reflector. Figure 2 shows a view of the framework. Bearings on the polar shaft support the\npolar wheel; the polar drive is by pinions at the drive skid. The mass of the\nframing members - steel angles, tees, pipes, and wide-flange beams - is\nabout 42, 000 kg. Additional concentrations, which total 18, 000 kg, are dis tributed to joints in the vicinity of the drive skid and at the upper and lower\nbearings of the polar shaft. The mass matrix for the full model has 165\ntranslational degrees of freedom. The stiffness matrix, with rotations included, contains 195 degrees of freedom.\nThe orders of both of these models were so small that it was feasible\nto solve the eigenvalue problems without condensation. After this, the solution accuracy for the first four frequencies and mode shapes was tracked\nthrough successive condensation solutions with diminishing numbers of indicator degrees of freedom. These indicators were originally chosen as carefully as would be expected in ordinary practice, and with reference to the\nguidelines stated previously.\nFigures 3 and 4 show the errors in frequency plotted against the percent of degrees of freedom retained. This percentage is for the ratio of the\nnumber of indicator degrees of freedom to the order of the uncondensed mass\nmatrix. Quick comparisons of mode shapes were also made for the cases\n\n204\n\nrepresented in these figures by examining the eigenvector components with the\nlargest magnitudes. It was found, in general, that the eigenvector errors\nwe re considerably larger than the frequency errors. In some instances, the\nmode shapes from condensed solutions with small frequency errors were\nfound to be unrelated to the mode shapes from the full solution. Usually, if\nfrequencies were in error by more than about 3 to 5%, the mode shapes were\nno better than poor; frequency errors greater than 10 to 15% were accompanied by mode shapes that were rated from very poor to completely unrelated\nto the full-solution mode shapes.\nAccording to a conventional rule of thumb, the ratio of the number of\ndegrees of freedom in the model to the number of accurate modes in the solution is between two and three. Therefore, according to this rule, the first\nfour modes should be reproduced for either of these two models by retaining\nless than 10% of the full number of degrees of freedom. From another standpoint, it would not seem reasonable to consider condensation procedures to be\nhighly effective unless accurate solutions for several modes could be obtained\nconsistently with at least an order of magnitude reduction in the solution size.\nWith these anticipations in mind, the results presented in figures 3 and 4,\nwhich show large errors for retentions greater than 10%, were highly\ndisappointing.\nHowever, the procedure was not abandoned at this point; instead, an\nentirely different approach was used for selection of the indicator degrees of\nfreedom. This was an after-the-fact selection, in which the mode shapes\nfrom the uncondensed solutions were inspected to select the degrees of freedom that actually had the largest motions. Trial-and-error changes were also\nmade in the retained set of indicators, as the number of indicators in the set\nwas being reduced, in an attempt to identify and retain certain key degrees of\nfreedom that apparently controlled solution validity.\nThe results of the modified selection of indicators,\n5 and 6, are a substantial improvement. For both models,\nmodes have been recovered with the order of the condensed\nlem solution (as given by the number of indicators) equal to\nthe order of the uncondensed mass matrix.\n\nshown in figures\nthe fir st four\neigenvalue probless than 10% of\n\nEVALUATION OF RESULTS OF CONVENTIONAL METHOD\nThe success achieved for the modified selection confirms the theoretical validity of the conventional method but is of little practical help to the\nanalyst. Although it was found that a selection of indicator degrees of free dom that included the degrees of freedom with the largest modal displacements tended to produce a substantial improvement in the validity of the solution, to make such a selection would require either clairvoyance or prior\nknowledge. By examination of the degrees of freedom that were eventually\nretained in the successful sets of indicators, it was also found neither nece ssary nor sufficient to choose degrees of freedom with the largest entries in\nthe mass matrix.\n\n205\n\nAnother unfortunate property of the conventional method is the failure\nto converge toward improved accuracy. Addition of indicators to a poorly\nchosen set would sometimes closely reproduce the current inaccurate solution. The danger here is that the consistency of the results could be misinterpreted as evidence of accuracy . Accuracy appears to depend upon the\nchoice of a set of indicators (not necessarily a large set) that contains key but\nelusive degrees of freedom. In some instances, the omission or addition of a\nsingle key indicator triggered the loss or recovery of a complete mode.\nOne more difficulty of the conventional method is that success or\nfailure may be model-dependent. Better success was observed here in original selections for the reflector model than for the pedestal model. One reason for the difference may be the separation of the natural modes . It seems\nthat the best results are obtained for analytical models in which the modes\nhave the widest frequency separation.\n\nMODIFICATIONS FOR CONVENTIONAL METHOD\n\nTwo modifications to the conventional method are effective in inc re a sing reliability and removing some of the dependence upon the analyst\'s\nintuition or prior knowledge. The first consists of augmenting the indicatorderived displacement functions with up to six additional " static loading " dis placement vectors . The second involves improving accuracy by iterat ive recycling of the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure.\nIterat ive soluti ons within a reduced space have been proposed previously . Jennings and Orr (ref. 5) described a simultaneous iteration method\nthat employs an orthogonal set of trial vectors, and they also indicate an extension that can be used for solutions of unconstrained structures . \'Ojalvo and\nNewman (ref. 6) proposed a reduced-space solution employing a recursion\nalgorithm to generate sequences of trial vectors. Whetstone and Jones\n( ref. 7) used an initial Rayleigh-Ritz method based upon a selection of static\nforce and rigid-body displacement vectors as the starting point for a reducedspace Stodola method solution that generates orthogonal eigenvectors one at a\ntime. More recently, Dong, Wolf, and Peterson* employed iterative repetitions of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. The iterative Rayleigh-Ritz method, which\nis possibly the simplest of all to implement within existing analysis systems,\nis examined here with respect to accuracy and economy for practical applications. Additional displacement functions for the first modification can be developed within the context of a standard matrix i nterpretive analysis formulation such as the SAMIS program. The recycling modification, which also\nappears to have more potential, has been readily incorporated within both the\nSAMIS and NASTRAN programs.\n\n*In an article to be published in the Int. J. Numer . Meth. Eng.\n\n206\n\nAugmented Displacement Function Modification\nThe additional displacement functions are developed by first determining the six rigid-body displacements of the structure for independent unit\nmotions (three translations and three rotations) of the foundation. A loading\nmatrix is derived by post-multiplying the mass matrix by the N X 6 matrix of\nrigid-body dis1;lacements. That is, let [P] be the set of rigid-body displacements and let LP] be the loading matrix; then\n\n[P]\n\n=\n\n[M][p]\n\n( 5)\n\nThis loading is applied to the structure, and the corresponding displacements\nare added to the displacements constructed from the indicators. The resulting set of displacement functions becomes the transformation used in the condensed solution. Thus, let [ yR] be the additional static -loading displacement\nfunctions, and let [ y ] be the displacement functions generated by indicators;\n1\nthen [ y R is found from the solution of\n\nJ\n\n( 6)\n\nand\n(7)\n\nFrom this point on, the solution proceeds in the conventional way\n(see eq. 2 ). The order of the condensed eigenvalue problem is now L + 6. If\nL is small, the increase can be readily accommodated in the solution; if\nLis large, the increase is relatively small. Therefore, the increase in the\nsize of the solution and the computation time caused by the additional functions\nis not significant. In a limited number of evaluations of the relative accuracy\nimprovement, it appears that the rigid-body translations have a larger influence than the rigid-body foundation rotations. Hence, the effort in gene rating\nprogram input to define foundation rotations may not be worthwhile.\nThe added displacement functions constructed from the rigid-body\ntranslations are proportional to the displacements that result from loading the\nstructure with its own weight applied sequentially in the directions of the\nfoundation motions. In fact, the suggested additional displacement functions\nwere motivated by typically successful applications of Rayleigh\'s method in\nrecovering first-mode frequencies with the assumption of a single static selfweight loading displacement function. Therefore, the modification will ordinarily ensure the recovery of the fundamental frequency, and thereby remove\nat least one defect that has occasionally been noted in the conventional r:nethod.\n\n207\n\nRecycling Modification\nThe recycling modification is applied after an initial solution using\nindicator functions (optionally augmented by the static loading functions).\nThe initial mode shapes for the full N degrees of freedom are recovered as\nin equation (4) and are then applied as in equation (5) (in place of the rigidbody displacements) to generate new loading vectors; e.g.,\n\n[xo]\n\n=\n\n[Yo] [ c\\>o]\n\n(8)\n\n[P 1J\n\n=\n\n[M] [x 0 ]\n\n(9)\n\nAfter this, the transformation matrix for the first additional cycle\nis constructed by solving\n\n( 10)\nThe eigenvalue problem solution is then regenerated according to\nequation (3) . This procedure can be repeated iteratively until convergence\nto within a specified criterion is achieved. Equations (8), (9), and ( 10) are\napplicable with incremented superscripts at each subsequent cycle. A\nschematic o f the NASTRAN program adjustments to incorporate this modification is shown in Appendix A. A mathematical proof of eventual cyclic\nconvergence need not be supplied; it is only necessary to consider this as an\nextension of Stodola\'s procedure of matrix iteration (ref. 4) , for which convergence is readily established (ref. 8). That is, instead of iterating on\none trial modal vector at a time, the present modification is an extension\nto a block iteration that operates upon several vectors simultaneously.\nHere, the eigenvalue problem is solved repeatedly in a greatly reduced\nspace, which is in contrast to the classical uncondensed solution procedures\nthat perform only one solution of the problem in the full space of the original\nmass matrix. Therefore, to achieve solution economy, the emphasis is\nnow placed upon efficient performance of the operations leading to the\nformation of equation (3) rather than upon the procedures used in obtaining\nsolutions to this equation.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF MODIFICATIONS\n\nThe effects of the mo- .ifications to the procedures for the pedestal\nd\nmodel are shown in figure 7. Three curves are included for each mode:\ncurve A is for reference - to show the accuracy for the conventional initial\nsolution with indicator functions only; curve B shows the accuracy for the\nfirst modification - that is, six static-loading functions have been added to\nthe indicator functions of curve A; curve C represents the accuracy obtained\nwith the addition of only one new iteration cycle and starting with the mode\nshapes associated with the points of curve B. It can be seen in comparison\nwith the conventional solution that solutions with the six new displacement\nfunctions are often several times more accurate, and that solutions from\n\n208\n\nthe iteration cycle are typically more accurate by more than one order of\nmagnitude.\nMost of the indicators selected for the curves of figure 7 were from\nthe after-the-fact selection, and consisted of a relatively small set. In a\nfew cases, the addition of one iteration to the initial solution for larger\nsets of indicators produced excellent accuracy for relatively larger numbers\nof natural modes. In some of these examples, the particular set of indicators had produced invalid results on the initial cycle.\nTwo 5-cycle tests were performed for this model: the first was\nfor six indicator functions with no static-loading functions; the second was\nfor six static-loading functions with no indicator functions. Both tests revealed the four lowest frequencies with less than O. 6% error and with mode\nshapes rated between excellent (first mode) and fair (fourth mode). The\nindicator functions did not produce the first mode until the third cycle (50\nand 10% errors at first and second cycles, respectively). The staticloading functions produced the first-mode frequency with less than O. 1%\nerror at the second cycle, starting from 2. 0% at the first cycle. At each\ncycle, in both of these cases, the errors in frequency diminished monotonically for all six of the modes.\nMost of the iterative solution tests that have been made so far have\nbeen for analytical models of less than 200 degrees of freedom. For these\nmodels, the Givens method in NASTRAN rapidly provided the solutions for\nall modes of the uncondensed models. Hence, for these relatively small\nmodels, there were no large gains in computation times to be achieved through\niterative procedures. However, for larger models, the Givens method becomes impractical, and the solution is best obtained in NASTRAN via the Inverse Power method. If the problem size is large enough, the computation\ntime required to find a few modes becomes substantial. It would then be\nmore economical to solve the eigenvalue problem using the Givens method\nwithin a reduced space to perform a few iterative cycles.\n\nIn one example, an Inverse Power method solution was obtained\nwithout condensation for an analytical model of an antenna reflector that contained about 1300 degrees of freedom. Only the first modal solution was\ngenerated, which required about 32 min of computation time (Univac 1108Exec 8 computer) in the eigenvalue solution phase. After this, a Guyan\nreduction solution was performed with 29 indicator degrees of freedom and\ncontinued through five additional iteration cycles. The initial solution was\ncompleted after 15 min, the first iteration required 13 min, and each of the\nfour subsequent iteration cycles took 8 min. The changes in modal frequencies at each cycle diminish approximately according to a geometric progression. This relationship was used to extrapolate the modal frequencies at\nconvergence. Figure 8a shows the numbers of natural frequencies obtained\ncyclically with respect to limiting percentages of variation from the extrapolated convergent frequencies. Figure 8b indicates the estimated computer\ntime saved if the same number of modes that were obtai-ned with less than\n0. 05% variation from the convergent frequencies had been derived by the Inverse Power method on the uncondensed model. The Inverse Power method\n\n209\n\ntime was estimated as 32 min for the first mode and 24 min for each additional\nmode. Since the first mode from the initial Guyan reduction had a variation of\n1. 6% and the remaining modes had higher variations, the corresponding computation time at the zero 1th cycle on the figure is represented as a loss.\nCONCLUSION\nThe two new modifications tend to make results of condensed eigenvalue solutions considerably more reliable and accurate by removing some of\nthe emphasis on the difficult and subjective choice of the indicator degrees of\nfreedom. The modification that consists \xc2\xb7 of adding the new static-loading\ndisplacement functions will usually add very little to the solution time. The\ncycling modification will require significant additional solution time for each\ncycle; (of the same order as for one cycle of the conventional method).\nIterative cycling provides the analyst with several approaches. He\ncan select L indicators (po~sibly at random) and, with a sufficient number of\ncycles, be assured of recovering the first L natural modes to within some\nspecified convergence criterion. Alternatively, a selection of a multiple of\nL indicators should be capable of producing the same L modes with a smaller\nnumber of iteration cycles. It has been found that the time for each iteration\ncycle tends to be proportional to the number of displacement functions employed; therefore another possibility for improving solution efficiency is to\nconsider truncating the set of displacement functions used for the later cycles.\nFinding the best ways to exploit these opportunities requires additional tests.\nNevertheless, until these are provided, it is clear that one additional cycle\nin itself is very useful, even if only to establish the validity of a conventional\ncondensed solution.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nGuyan, R.

K. Gieseke\nSenior Dynamics Engineer\nConvair Aerospace Division of General Dynamics\nSan Diego, California\nSUMMARY\n\nThe development of analytical dynamic models for the Space Shuttle system is traced from\nsimplified early versions through current models of complex representation. The sequence of\nmodels also displays changes in design that have occurred during configuration definition and\ndevelopment activities. Alterations to the analytical models for accuracy of representation and\nimproved graphical display are explained. A discussion is included that examines the program\ncharacteristics of NASTRAN, particularly as it operates within the environment of the computer\nmonitor system and influences the analysis procedure.\nINTRODUCTION\nSpace Shuttle is a substantial departure from currently employed concepts of space launch vehicles.\nNot only does it represent a change in operational technique - a fully reusable system rather than\na totally expendable one \xc2\xb7- and open the door to a meaningful manned earth orbit program, it also\npresents new and challenging technical problems.\nThe shuttle concept of operations provides for a booster vehicle providing power to lift the\nsystem to high altitude and an orbiter vehicle to complete the mission of carrying men and supplies\nto an earth-orbiting destination. The two vehicles are mated in piggyback fashion during the boost\nphase. At an optimum point in the trajectory, the orbiter is separated from the booster and, under\nits own power, continues into orbit, carrying the payload. The booster begins a cruiseback phase,\nand once back in the lower atmosphere, uses jet engines to effect a powered horizontal landing.\nThe orbiter, when it returns from its mission, re-enters the atmosphere and lands in a similar\nfashion. Following a period of refurbishment, booster and orbiter vehicles are ready for another\nearth-to-orbit mission.\nSeveral variations of Space Shuttle configurations, representing different operational concepts,\ncurrently exist and are being examined. The discussion that follows reviews the history of modal\nanalysis via NASTRAN for the Space Shuttle during recent configuration definition and\ndevelopment activities, beginning with unsophisticated beam system representations and progressing\nthrough successive levels of complex structural modeling.\nSince the work reported here has been done by a potential booster vehicle contractor,\nemphasis is placed on the booster portion of the Space Shuttle system. Thus, while both vehicles\nare included in the studies, booster behavior is the principal area of interest.\nEARLY ANALYTICAL MODELS\nIn the initial stages of development of a program such as Space Shuttle, mission requirements and\nvehicle configurations tend to change rapidly. Structural analysis during this period is generally\nlimited to gross design factors; dynamic considerations more often than not are defined only as\nload factors, often based solely on judgment and simple hand calculations.\n\n221\n\nWhen all but a few candidate configurations have been eliminated, structural analysis of some\ngreater depth may begin. Structural dynamics models for this phase are generally quite simple, since\nsignificant design changes are inevitable and the effort required to achieve extreme accuracy cannot\nbe justified.\nThe first Space Shutde analytical model constructed for use with NASTRAN simulated an\norbiter mated to a V-tail configured booster. An artist\'s rendition of this booster design is shown in\nfigure 1. Estimates of EI, AE, and GJ distributions along the lengths of the fuselage, wings, and tail\nprovided approximate section properties for uniform beam segments (NASTRAN\'s BAR elements)\nused to represent these components of the booster vehicle. Elastic characteristics of the orbiter\nwere not available at the time of this study; consequently, a rigid orbiter simulation was used. The\nmodel takes advantage of the symmetry of both vehicles in the pitch plane and represents the left\nside of the mated configuration only (figure 2).\nAt the time of this analysis, the arrangement of the booster-orbiter attachment linkages and\ntheir elastic properties was not firmly defined. Consequently, spring rates were assigned to the links\nso as to give the desired minimum 2.0 Hz frequency of response for rigid vehicles. Representation\nof the attachment links (figure 3) in the NASTRAN model was by scalar springs (ELASi).\nConnection of the various components was achieved through the use of dependency equations,\nor, in NASTRAN terminology, equations of multipoint constraint (MPC). The BAR elements\nrepresenting the booster fuselage were located along the booster fuselage centerline. Wing and tail\nroots were located at the periphery of the fuselage cross-section, one fuselage radius away from the\nfuselage BAR segments. Additional grid points were located on the fuselage center line at the same\nfuselage station as the neutral axes of the wing and tail at their respective roots. Rigid links were\nintroduced into the model connecting booster fuselage elements to wing and tail roots. These rigid\nlinks permitted the motions of wing and tail root grid points to be defined in terms of the fuselage\ngrid points adjacent.\nThe ends of the booster-orbiter attachment springs were likewise located at a geometric offset\nfrom both vehicle center lines. Dependency equations were employed here also, expressing motions\nat the spring ends as functions of the motions of points on booster and orbiter center lines. For\nthe booster, these points were in the transverse plane of the spring ends; for the orbiter, the center\nof gravity was used as the reference grid point. (Since the orbiter was rigid, there can be only one\nindependent grid point in the model.)\nFor graphical display purposes, plot elements (PLOTEL) were included to show the fictitious\nrigid connection links between components and the attachment springs. The rigid orbiter center line\nwas also displayed through the use of plot elements connecting grid points at nose and tail. These\npoints were rigidly connected to the orbiter center of gravity by multipoint constraint equations.\nThis first Space Shuttle model contained 34 grid points, but the various constraints imposed\non it reduced the number of degrees of freedom of the eigenvalue problem to about 100 for a\ngiven symmetry boundary condition. Since no coordinate elimination procedures (OMIT cards)\nwere employed, the stiffness matrix remained reasonably well banded, with a semi~bandwidth of 30\nto 40. Modal data was extracted with a minimum of effort and expense.\nWhen the V-tail concept was replaced with a conventional vertical tail version (figure 4), the\nmodal model was accordingly revised (figure 5). This change provided an opportunity to introduce\ncertain changes in modeling concept.\nThe first area of model improvement was the introduction of a new representation of\nlongitudinal behavior for the booster fuselage. Earlier studies ( ref. 1) have developed a spring-mass\nanalogy to account for the interaction of fluids and their tanks under longitudinal excitation. The\npresence of large amounts of propellants in the booster fuselage invalidates any simulation of\nlongitudinal behavior based on structural characteristics alone, hence the necessity for a distinct\n222\n\nfluid-tank longitudinal model (figure 6). Models such as this have been shown to give good\napproximation to the first longitudinal mode of fluids in elastic tanks.\nThe fluid-tank mo_ was incorporated into the Space Shuttle model by ( 1) defining the new\ndel\nbooster fuselage longitudinal description using scalar points and scalar springs; (2) constraining all\nlongitudinal degrees of freedom in the booster fuselage beam representation; and (3) rewriting all\npertinent multipoint constraint equations, substituting the appropriate scalar degree of freedom in\nthe new model for the previously used fuselage longitudinal degree of freedom.\nSecondly, with the earlier model, it was impossible to display wing and tail torsional\nresponses. To overcome this deficiency, grid points were added to the model on the leading and\ntrailing edges of wing and tail surfaces directly in line with the existing grid points located on the\nneutral axes of those components. The aerodynamic surfaces were still idealized as beams, so these\nnew grid points were not used for any elasticity or mass definition. However, by assuming that the\ncross-sections of the surfaces remained rigid when deforming, the motions of the edge points could\nbe defined (through the use of MPC equations) in terms of the motions of the corresponding points\non the neutral axes. Plot elements connecting the edge points permitted the neutral plane of the\naerodynamic surfaces to be displayed in the structure plots, and more accurate evaluation of the\ncharacter of the modal distortions was possible.\nThe eigenvalue problem resulting from this simulation is not significantly larger than that of\nthe first described model, although, with the addition of grid points on the edges of the\naerodynamic surfaces, the initial order of the problem (NASTRAN\'s g-size) is increased by over\n200. At the moderate cost involved in handling the additional dependent degrees of freedom, a\nmuch more meaningful display of modal distortions is achieved (figure 7).\nAnalysis of the model just described revealed that the configuration had a fundamental elastic\nmode under antisymmetric boundary conditions of 0.82 Hz. At this frequency, coupling of\nstructural responses with nonstructural dynamic effects such as slosh or rigid body control\nfrequencies, becomes possible. The mode shape associated with this frequency indicated that the\ntwo vehicles were yawing in opposition with very little bending. The potential energy of the mode\nshape was found to be concentrated in the attachment springs and in torsional distortion of the\nbooster fuselage. Since neither orbiter flexibility nor booster fuselage local flexibilities had been\nincluded in the model, the actual frequency for the design would be substantially lower than that\ncalculated, and adverse coupling problems would be a near certainty.\nFUSELAGE MODEL REFINEMENT\nTo accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the fuselage structural redesign initiated to raise the\nfundamental antisymmetric frequency, a detailed structural model of the booster fuselage was\ndeveloped for the next configuration in the sequence, a delta wing version (figure 8). In\nanticipation that this model would later be incorporated into a complete system dynamic model,\nNASTRAN was chosen to be the analytical tool to be used in the loads analysis to take advantage\nof its capacity for both static and dynamic studies. The portion of the booster fuselage modeled as\na stiffened cylinder included the region from the forward orbiter attach point to the leading wing\nspar, some 1-1/3 diameters aft of the rear orbiter attach point. This region incorporates the\nintertank structure plus the forward portion of the LH2 tank (figure 9). Major strength frames such\nas those supporting the attachment fittings were modeled directly, using six BAR elements of\ndifferent section properties, each representing a 30-degree segment of a half-frame. Other stiffening\nframes were modeled in a similar manner after first combining several into one equivalent frame.\nLongitudinal stiffeners at 30 degrees around the fuselage circumference were given section\nproperties to duplicate the axial load carrying capacity of the actual stiffeners plus the effective\n\n223\n\nskin areas. Rectangular shear panels completed the fuselage model. The orbiter attachment links\n(which, by this time, had been designed) were represented by axial load carrying (ROD) elements.\nBy fixing the aft-most frame and applying loads to the orbiter side of the attachment links, a\ndetailed stress analysis was carried out. This model provided a good evaluation of the flexibility of\nthe booster fuselage local structure supporting the orbiter attachment links as well as the links\nthemselves. As design changes have been made, the model has been revised and used to evaluate the\neffect of such changes on the flexibilities of the region.\nTo use this cylindrical model for evaluation of modal properties of the mated configuration\nrequired both integration of the model into the simulation of the rest of the structure and adding\nmass information in an effective manner.\nThe remainder of the booster fuselage, both fore and aft, was still defined only in terms of\nstiffness and mass versus fuselage station; the beam simulation approach previously employed was\nagain used for these regions. The problem of compatibility between the beam representation and\nthe detailed skin-frame model is accomplished by defining grid points located at the intersection of\nthe planes of the first and last frame modeled, and the fuselage center line. The adjacent beam\nelements connect directly to these grid points.\nFigure 10 shows a cross-section of a frame of the fuselage model. Displacement coordinates\nare shown to be in a cylindrical system (direction 1 is radial; 2 is tangential; 3 is normal) for\nexterior grid points 1 through 7 and rectangular for the center grid point, 0. Rotation about a\ncoordinate direction, i, is identified as component i + 3. Let uiU) represent motion component i for\ngrid point j. Then a set of compatibility expressions can be written as\nul (0) = (u3(l) + u3(7))/2\n\n(1)\n\nuz(O) = (-ul (1) + u2(7))/2\n\n(2)\n\nu3(0) = (u1 (1) - ul (7))/2\n\n(3)\n\nu4(0) = (u2(l) + uz(7)/2r\n\n(4)\n\nu5(0) = (u1 (1) - ul (7))f2r\n\n(5)\n\nu6(0) = u3(4)/r\n\n( 6)\n\nTo reduce the size of the modal problem as far as practical, mass distribution in the fuselage,\nincluding propellants, was defined in terms of fuselage station. Concentrated masses were assigned\nto fictitious grid points located on the fuselage center line at each frame of the model. Application\nof the compatibility equations ( 1) through ( 6) at each frame related these masses to the elasticity\nof the fuselage structure.\nThe delta wing design of this new configuration does not lend itself to simple beam simulation\nof aerodynamic surfaces. Efforts were made to incorporate flexible aerodynamic surfaces into the\ndynamic model, but for reasons that will be discussed below, attempts to do so were unsuccessful.\nThe critical concern at the time was the frequency of the lowest elastic mode. Previous work had\nsuggested that for the lowest modes, little strain energy would be found in the aerodynamic\nsurfaces. Consequently, it was decided to proceed with the analysis using rigid representation of the\naerodynamic surfaces.\nOrbiter stiffness and mass distributions versus longitudinal station were obtained and a flexible\nbeam model made for it. The assembled dynamic model is shown in figure 11. The unrestrained\n\n224\n\nsize of the system (g-size) is 7 50. Application of boundary constraints and dependency equations\n(SPC and MPC cards) reduced this order to 501. All remaining degrees of freedom without mass\nproperties were removed by static condensation procedures (OMIT cards), leaving an eigenvalue\nproblem size of 58. The fundamental antisymmetric mode obtained (figure 12) had a frequency of\n0.9 Hz or 0.08 Hz more than the earlier, simplified model. The additional flexibility contained in\nthe new model due to the local structure effects is compensated for by increased stiffness due to\nredesign, hence the negligible change in frequency.\nThe wing and tail of the booster generate large loads that are reacted into the fuselage\nimmediately aft of the region modeled in detail. The transformation from cylinder to beam\nrepresentation used in this study was inadequate:: to transmit these loads properly and excessive\nmodel distortions resulted in this region. If the stiffened cylinder form of representation for the\nbooster fuselage were extended further aft, the proper paths for loads from the aerodynamic\nsurfaces could be developed and more representative modal displacements would result.\nThe model described above is inadequate if higher modes of the structure are to be obtained,\nsince rigid aerodynamic surfaces were used. As the frequency approaches that of the aerodynamic\nsurfaces alone, their contribution becomes more significant and an elastic representation becomes a\nnecessity.\nMODELING OF FLEXIBLE AERODYNAMIC SURFACES\nThe design of the aerodynamic surfaces - wing, tail, and canard - of the Space Shuttle booster\nwas assigned to the engineering staff at the Fort Worth operation of Convair Aerospace. An\nanalytical model of each surface was prepared and analyzed at that facility using a computer\nprogram other than NASTRAN. The elastic characteristics of the three components were\ntransmitted to the San Diego operation of Convair Aerospace in the form of an unrestrained\nstiffness matrix on cards. Concentrated weight distributions and geometric data were supplied in\nprinted form. These latter two classes of data were easily reformatted into NASTRAN form, the\nweight data as CONM2 cards and the geometric data as GRID cards.\nThe procedure chosen to enter the elasticity information for the aerodynamic surfaces into the\nNASTRAN simulation was to use DMIG cards to input the stiffness matrices directly, then add\nthem to the stiffness matrix generated by NASTRAN for the remainder of the structure. Once the\nmatrix additions are accomplished, the analysis continues in the normal manner.\nThe stiffness matrices for the canard, wing, and tail are respectively of order 42, 98, and 42,\nand essentially full due to earlier static condensations. Using small field form exclusively, some\n7,000 card images are required to enter the data. The limitation of eight characters per field where\nexponential form is necessary degrades the accuracy of the data to a degree that adequate\ndescription of the characteristics of the aerodynamic surfaces could not be achieved in this fashion.\nOne possible remedy is the use of large field format for the DMIG cards, but this was rejected as a\nsolution due to the cost and hazards associated with processing 14,000 bulk data cards.\nThe technique currently being implemented for introducing the elasticity of the aerodynamic\nsurfaces involves the use of the general element (GENEL). Using static condensation techniques, the\ndegrees of freedom in each stiffness matrix have been reduced to a number more appropriate to the\ntask of obtaining total vehicle modes. The mass matrices have also been reduced using the same\nGuyan techniques as in NASTRAN. For the canard, wing, and tail, these reduced orders are 5, 40,\nand 10 n;spectively. Inversion of the stiffness matrices, after determinate constraints are applied,\nproduces the flexibility matrix required for the general element definition. Use of the general\nelement enables the elastic properties of the aerodynamic surfaces to be entered into the analysis\nby using only 300 cards. And, as the theoretical discussion- of the general element points out, for\n\n225\n\nthe same number of significant digits, the flexibility matrix contains more accuracy since the rigid\nbody components have been removed.\nThe modal amplitude at all grid points on the aerodynamic surfaces can be recovered if the\ngrid points are included in the initial description of the system. The deleted degrees of freedom are\nindicated as fixed on the GRID card, so that the eigenvector resulting from the eigenvalue\noperation will indicate zero amplitudes for these elements.\nThe condensation process has performed the following operation\n\n(7)\nwhere\n[Kred.J is the condensed stiffness matrix and [Krr] ,[~d] ,[Kdd], and[Kdr ]are partitions of the\noriginal matrix with subscripts r and d indicating retained and deleted degrees of freedom,\nrespectively. Defining\n(8)\n\nfrom the theory upon which the condensation is based\n(9)\n\nwhere {ud} is the vector of deleted degrees of freedom and {ur} is the vector of degrees of freedom\nretained.\nThe g-size eigenvector matrix produced by modules READ and SDRl can be partitioned into\nnonsurface degrees of freedom, surface degrees of freedom retained, and surface degrees of freedom\ndeleted.\n( 10)\n\ncp\n\n{\xc2\xa2}\n\n=\n0\n\nIf the recovery matrix, [G ], is entered into the analysis via DMIG cards, it will be given an\norder equal to the g-size, with zero fill where appropriate. Thus, it can modify the eigenvector\nmatrix via matrix algebra to obtain the modal amplitude of the deleted surface degrees of freedom.\n\n( 11)\n\nI\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\nI\nI\n\n0\n\n- - - - I- - - I\n\n0\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\nI\n\nG\n\nI\n\n0\n\n-+ - - I\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\n0\n\n--- ~ - - - -i --\xc2\xa2d\n\n226\n\n0\n\nI\n\ncp\n\nI\nI\n\n\xc2\xa2r\n\n0\n\nThe final eigenvector, including all coordinates on the aerodynamic surfaces, is\n\n{\xc2\xa2} =\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\n0\n\n+\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\n0\n\nThis procedure will be applied to the current Space Shuttle model, shown in figure 13. This\nmodel with flexible booster aerodynamic surfaces and detailed modeling of the entire booster\nfuselage, is expected to yield much useful information about the dynamic characteristics of the\nSpace Shuttle vehicle.\nPROGRAM-ORIENTED CONSIDERATIONS\nAll analytical investigations are idealizations of reality, influenced among other things by the nature\nof the analysis tools available. The characteristics of NASTRAN, particularly when situated in the\nenvironment of the Computer Laboratory at \xc2\xb7the San Diego operation of Convair Aerospace, have\ninfluenced the analyses just described in several significant ways.\nThe current configuration of the Scientific Data Processing Laboratory at the San Diego\nfacility consists of a CDC 6400 system that includes a central processor of 65,00010 - sixty-bit\nword capacity. It currently uses the SCOPE 3.2 monitor system. About 140,0008 words at core\nstorage are available to the batch job user. To restate the size of available core in terms that may\nbe more meaningful to NASTRAN users, for this facility the matrix decomposition routines of\nNASTRAN are limited to semiband widths of 140 to 160 for symmetric decomposition and 70 to\n80 for unsymmetric decomposition if spill logic is to be avoided.\nNASTRAN has not been constructed to operate most effectively in such a confining\nenvironment and consequently, comparisons with other programs are often unfavorable. The\nplanned single precision option will substantially improve NASTRAN\'s performance on CDC\ncomputers, both in terms of speed of operation and in practical problem size. Further, the use of a\nsymmetric matrix decomposition \xc2\xb7procedure for normal mode extraction would further enhance its\nattractiveness to structural dynamicsts.\nA computer user cost algorithm that assigns progressively high er scaling factors to larger field\nlength jobs has forced users to experiment with minimum field length requests when using\nNASTRAN. For the size and character of problems being analyzed, experience has shown that\nnearly . all functional modules can operate at a field length of 120,0008 cells or less. One regularly\nused module that needs more memory is the Structural Matrix Assembler, phase 1 (SMAl), which\nnormally requires an additional 10,0008 cells. Operations involving matrix decomposition have\xc2\xb7 field\nlength requirements more directly dependent on the order of the matrices involved. To reduce the\ncost of a NASTRAN analysis, the execution of the sequence of functional modules may be\narbitrarily broken into three or more segments of different field lengths. For example, modal\nanalysis problems have been solved in three separate p asses : first, at a field length of 130,0008\ncells, to get past SMAl; the second, at a field length of 12 0,0008 cells, to continue the analysis to\nthe eigenvalue module, READ; and lastly, at a field length of 140,0008 cells, the execution of the\nREAD module, which involves an unsymmetric matrix decomposition, and final output of\neigenfunctions . Plotting, if desired, is acquired in a fo u rth run, at 120,0008 cells of core storage.\n\n227\n\nBut by far the most difficult problem associated with using NASTRAN is the fact that it has\nnot been possible to access the source code. The CDC version of NASTRAN was coded for the\nstandards of the Langley Research Center CDC facility, which has a unique version of the CDC\nRUN compiler. As a consequence, NASTRAN source code cannot be compiled using the standard\nRUN compiler or the San Diego operation RUN compiler. Further, no correction or modifications\ncan be made and when a program error is found, the only recourse is to redefine the solution\nprocess so that the error is not encountered. All potential resolutions to this problem have thus far\nbeen judged unacceptable or have encountered difficulties in implementation. A source code based\non standard RUN compiler FORTRAN for future versions of NASTRAN would substantially\nimprove the task of program maintenance at the various CDC installations having the program.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nRose, R.G., Staley, JA., and Simson, A.K.: A Study of System-Coupled Longitudinal\nInstabilities in Liquid Rockets - Part I, Analytical Model.

N. Jabbour\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, the problem of determining the normal modes of RAE booms and\nspacecraft for in-flight configuration is analyzed. The solution is based on the use of a\nfinite element model of the booms and spacecraft along with NASTRAN\' s normal mode\nanalysis. The inverse power method of eigenvalue extraction was utilized.\nThe results are presented as a summary of real eigenvalues and plots of the six\nrigid body mode shapes, the eight first mode shapes, and the eight second mode shapes.\nThe study showed that considerable care must be exercised when using NASTRAN\nin the solution of complex problems.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe objective of the RAE satellite project is to measure the intensity of radio\nsignals from celestial sources. To achieve this objective the spacecraft employed a\npair of long "V" antennas back to back, thus forming a large "X\'\' with central hub of\ninstrumentation at the juncture of the antennas (fig. 1). The antennas (or the booms)\nare tubular structures which were deployed from the central body once the spacecraft\nwas in 6000 km circular orbit. Gravity-gradient attitude stabilization was used so that\none set will always point toward the earth.\nThe problem of determining the in-flight boom shape is an important one because\nthe interpretation of the experimental data requires an accurate knowledge of the antenna\npattern at the time of observation (see refs. 1 to 7). The booms in orbit are under the\ninfluence of gravitational, inertial, and solar pressure forces and thermal bending.\nThe purpose of this study is to generate a NASTRAN model to determine the normal\nmodes of RAE booms in a field free of gravitational, inertial, and thermal forces.\n\n237\n\nFigure l \xe2\x80\xa2 RAE booms geometry.\n\nCOMPUTER SIMULATION\nThe RAE booms were modeled using CBAR elements with coordinate systems\nparallel to the booms. Multipoint constraint (MPC) cards were used to express the\ninextensibility of the booms in the longitudinal direction. CONM2 and SUPORT cards\nwere used to model the central hub and its fictitious support. Figure 1 shows the finite\nelement model for RAE booms and spacecraft.\n\nA reasonable and accurate way of modeling the booms necessitated the use of\n37 grid points having 144 degrees of freedom. The computer time required for a\nnominal run was between 8 and 12 minutes using an IBM 360/95. The plots shown in\nfigures 2 to 5 were generated using a Stromberg-Carlson 4020 plotter.\nThe parameters involved in this study, as used in the bulk data, are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n\nTube diameter = 0 ,58 inch\nWeight = 0,017 lb/ft\nEffective Stiffness, EI = 2000 lb-in 2\nLength = 450 to 750 feet\n"V" angle = 60\xc2\xb0\nCentral Hub Weight = 425. 73 lb\nCentral Hub Inertias:\nI xx\nI yy\nIzz\nI xy\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n81,046,56 slug-in 2\n931.5276 slug-in2\n81, 761.04 slug-in 2\n3,924.336 slug-in2\n\nx, y, and z axes are defined as shown below:\n\nz\n\ny\n\nBOOMS\n\nBOOMS\n\n239\n\nCOMPUTER RESULTS\nThe following table summarizes the RAE booms real eigenvalues, frequencies, and\nperiods for 450\' length.

Additional views of RAE booms mode shapes .\n\nThe comparison between the results of this study and the results obtained in\nreference 1 are not conclusive because the assumptions used in both analyses are\ndifferent. However, a check was made using the same boom stiffness and mass. The\nresults compared well for the first six modes where the maximum difference was less\nthan 7 .2%. Greater discrepancy was found in modes 13 and 14. No second modes were\nobtained in reference 1.\n\nFUTURE RE SEARCH\nThis study was initiated to test NASTRAN\' s capabilities to extract closely spaced\neigenvalues of small magnitude. The work was concluded with success, although some\ndifficulties were encountered in the early runs. Since then, it is felt that additional\nwork should be initiated to complete this study through the inclusion of gravitational,\ninertial, and thermal effects. The extension of this work will yield more meaningful\nresults which can be easily compared with some of the results in references 1 to 7.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe first computer runs for the RAE booms and spacecraft normal mode analysis\nwere performed between August and November 1969. Therefore, some of the\ndifficulties which were encountered at that time may have been resolved now. Some of\nthese were:\n\n1. Difficulty of interpreting some of the NASTRAN messages concerning the\nreasons for termination of the eigenvalue analysis.\n2. Non-uniformity in the computer time required for\nrun required about 43 minutes while other runs of\nvalue search region is slightly different) required\nthe matrix decomposition time estimate, given by\n119 seconds and 34 seconds.\n\nsimilar runs. At least one\na very similar deck (eigenabout 13 minutes. Moreover,\nNASTRAN, varied between\n\n3. Difficulty in judging the need for multipoint constraints.\nIt should be noted that the runs performed recently were consistent in the decompo sition time estimate and the required computer time. However, this study showed\nthat considerable care must be exercised when using NASTRAN in the solution of\ncomplex problems. It is recommended that the results be checked, whenever possible,\nusing different model and/or independent analysis.\n\n248\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Keat, J.

L. Huang and H. Rubin\nNaval Air Development Center\n\nSUMMARY\nA static stress analysis and a dynamic modal analysis of the horizontal stabilizer of the F-14A aircraft has been conducted at the Naval\nAir Development Center employing the NASTRAN program. The structural model\ncontains 1518 elements including bars , rods, shear panels and orthotropic\nand isotropic membrane elements with 1357 degrees of freedom. Static deflection and stresses, including thermal stresses, under maximum load at\nroom and at elevated temperatures are calculated and results are in good\nagreement with experimental data. Through application of "Guyan Reduction"\nthe number of degrees of freedom used in the dynamic analysis is reduced to\n137 . The frequencies and mode shapes for the first two modes are obtai ned .\n\nNOMENCLATURE\nE\n\nModulus of elasticity in tension and compression\n\nG\n\nModulus of elasticity in shear\n\nV\n\nPoisson\'s ratio\n\nx,y , z\n\nLaminate material coordinates\nNormal components of stress parallel to x- and y-axes\nShear component of stress in x , y\n\ncoordinates\n\n251\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe horizontal stabilizer is an all movable surface pivoting about a\nshaft integral with the fuselage. Surface actuation is by hydraulic actuator mounted within t,he fuselage and acting on the stabilizer horn fitting.\nThe entire assembly is depicted schematically in figure 1. The stabilizer\nis composed of four major structural parts: the main panel, leading edge,\ntrailing edge and tip. The main load carrying component is the main panel\nassembly; the other three components resist aerodynamic pressure and transfer it to the main panel. The leading edge, trailing edge and tip assemblies are of full depth aluminum honeycomb core with aluminum skins. The\nmain panel is of sandwich construction with aluminum honeycomb core and\nboron-epoxy composite cover skins. Composite skins are structurally optimized with laminates of various constructions, orientations and thicknesses\ntailored to local strength requirements. Titanium is used for root and\nintermediate ribs, forward and rear closure beams, and intercostal pivot bearing-support beams. The skins in the pivot area are titanium to enable\nfastening to the titanium substructure. The boron skins are attached to\nthe titanium by means of bonded splice joints.\nSTRUCTURAL IDEALIZATION\nThe idealized structural model is shown in figure 2. It is a NASTRAN\ncomputer-drawn plot showing the geometry, the individual elements and the\ninterconnection of the model. The model includes the main panel but excludes the leading and trailing edges and the wing tip. The honeycomb core\nhas been compressed into discrete spar and rib shear panels of equivalent\nshear stiffness and rods of equivalent compressive stiffness. The metallic\nskins are represented by isotropic quadrilateral membrane elements, and the\nboron-epoxy laminated skins are represented by orthotropic triangular membrane elements. There are additional rod elements to represent axial load\ncarrying material along the ribs and beams. The pivot shaft is represented\nby bar elements which carry axial and shear loads as well as bending moments. The end of the pivot shaft supported by the fuselage is assumed to\nbe fixed. The bearings are simulated by radial rods connected to the shaft.\nFree bearing rotation is simulated by eliminating the connections between\nthe rotational motions of the bars and rods at the connecting grid points.\nThe structural model consists of 673 membrane elements, 444 shear\npanels, 399 rods and two bars for a total of 1518 elements interconnected\nat 453 grid points. The total number of degrees of freedom is 1357.\n\n252\n\nSTATIC ANALYSIS\nStatic Load\nThe idealized structure was analyzed for the critical loading condition, maximum bending. Results were obtained at room temperature and at\n422\xc2\xb0K. The distributed aerodynamic load was replaced with concentrated\nforces acting at the grid points. These concentrated forces were computed\nfrom static test loads and are statically equivalent to the static test\nloads. Since the wing tip and the leading and trailing edges are absent\nfrom the idealized structure, test loads applied to these parts were replaced with statically equivalent loads acting at adjacent grid points.\nTo react to the applied loads and provide static equilibrium the idealized\nstructure is supported by a cantilever beam (the pivot shaft) passing\nthrough the two bearings. The stabilizer is constrained from rotation by\na pin-ended rod connecting the pivot horn to a fixed point.\nProblems Encountered and Solutions\nThe major problems encountered while running the static analysis\nusing rigid format 1 of NASTRAN version 11.1 included:\n1.\n\nLefthanded coordinate system which is not compatible with NASTRAN.\n\n2. Meaningless results for shear panels with two sides parallel and\nthe other two nearly parallel.\n3. Isotropic quadrilateral membrane element with all three material\nproperties E, G and v independent of each other gives meaningless results.\n4. Erroneous NASTRAN calculated stiffness and stresses for orthotropic quadrilateral membrane element resulted from incorrect transformation of local material properties.\n5. Error in transforming coefficients of thermal expansion to local\ncoordinates.\n6. Total number of different orthotropic materials exceeded the\nnumber permitted in the program.\nFollowing actions were taken to resolve the above problems:\n1.\n\nSwitch to righthanded coordinate system.\n\n2. Reassign one of the nearly parallel sides of the shear panel as\nthe side connecting local element grid points Gland G2.\n\n253\n\n3. Avoid the use of isotropic quadrilateral membrane element with\nall three material properties independent.\n4. Employ orthotropic triangular membrane element instead of orthotropic quadrilateral element.\n5. Adjust input values for coefficients of thermal expansion such\nthat upon the erroneous coordinate transformation the results yield correct\nvalues for the coefficients of thermal expansion in the particular local\ncoordinates.\n6.\n\nKeep the total number of orthotropic materials to less than 100.\nNASTRAN Results and Comparison with Test\n\nThe structural model for the F-14A horizontal stabilizer was statically analyzed for the loading condition described above using NASTRAN program\nversion 11.1 on an IBM 360/65 computer. A typical run takes 24 minutes in\nCPU time.\nIn this analysis the following numerical data were output:\nDisplacements at all grid points\nStresses for all elements\nElement forces\nA computer drawn pictorial representation of the stabilizer deformation at\nroom temperature under the prescribed loading is presented in figure 3. It\nshows superimposed orthographic views of both the deformed and the undeformed structural model. To provide a clear separation between the two views,\nthe displacements of the stabilizer are deliberately exaggerated (approximately 50% larger than actual size). Numerical values of the vertical components of the displacements (displacements normal to the planform of the\nstabilizer) at selected points are tabulated in Table I. Also shown are\nthe comparable test deflection reported by the contractor.\nIn general, the correlation between the NASTRAN calculated deflections\nand the test results are reasonably good.\nFigures 4 and 5 are plots of laminate skin stresses at room temperature\nalong two chordwise sections R-8 and R-13,respectively. Physical locations\nof these sections are shown in figure 2. Test stresses calculated from experimental measurements are presented for comparison. There is good agreement for the dominant stress\n(normal stress in the direction of laminate\nmaterial axis). In general, NASTRAN stresses are slightly higher than the\nexperimental data. Internal forces and moments have been calculated for\n\nthe NASTRAN stresses along section R-8. These were checked for static equilibrium with the externally applied forces and found to be in close agreement. On the other hand, internal forces and moments estimated from\nmeasured stresses are lower than the externally imposed forces and moments.\nSkin stresses at elevated temperature are different from their corresponding values at room temperature, as a result of differences of thermal\nexpansion coefficients of the various structural materials including the\ndifferences between the various laminate constructions. Since no valid\nexperimental results are available for comparison, the trend and the magnitude of the changes in stresses from room to elevated temperature were carefully examined on the basis of the thermal elastic properties of the entire\nstructure and found to be correct.\nDYNAMIC ANALYSIS\nReduction of Stiffness and Mass Matrices\nIn a dynamic analysis of a structure fewer grid points are needed to\ndescribe the inertia properties of the structure than those needed to\ndescribe the elastic properties in the static analysis of the same structure\nfor a comparable degree of accuracy. Carrying out a dynamic analysis with\nmore grid points or degrees of freedom than fs needed will result in increased computational time and cost with little gain in accuracy.\nRather than construct a new structural model for dynamic analysis, the\nmodel used in the static analysis was employed in the following dynamic\nanalysis with the degrees of freedom reduced by the application of Guyan\nReduction, a procedure incorporated in NASTRAN. This procedure is essentially a rational redistribution of the inertia properties of the stabilizer to a\nset of selected grid points uniformly distributed over one surface of the\nstructure. With only one degree of freedom at each grid point retained,\nnamely the displacement component normal to the stabilizer planform, the\nresulting number of degrees of freedom in the dynamic analysis is 137.\nProblems Encountered and Solutions\nNASTRAN rigid format 3 with inverse power method is used to obtain the\nfirst few natural frequencies and mode shapes of the stabilizer.\nAs described in the static test, the stabilizer is considered to be\nsupported by the pivot shaft, and constrained from rotation by a control rod\nconnectin~ the pivot horn to a fixed point. Unlike in the static analysis,\nproblems encountered in the dynamic analysis are few and relatively straightforward. These include:\n\n255\n\n1. Insufficient file storage even though three (3) disc packs from an\nIBM 2314 unit were provided.\n2. Error occurred during a restart run. The NASTRAN program attempted\nto partition out rigid body supports, a procedure which is not called for in\nthis particular computer run of the rigid format.\nThe first problem was solved by storing several data blocks on tapes and rev:fsingthe procedure library such that unused data storage allocations are\nreleased. The second problem was circumvented by using appropriate ALTER\nstatements to jump over DMAP statements between 73 and 81 where the unwanted\nmatrix partition is executed.\nNASTRAN Results and Comparison with Test\nTwo normal modes of vibrations, one bending and one torsional, were\nobtained using a cold start plus two restarts. The total CPU time used was\n150 minutes of which 104 minutes were required for the stiffness and mass\nmatrices reduction. The natural frequencies associated with the two modes\nare 2\\.4 and 39.2Hz for the bending and the torsional modes of vibrations,\nrespectively. Mode shapes are depicted in figures 6 and 7. Experimental\nmode shapes are in general agreement with the corresponding NASTRAN calculated results. The corresponding natural frequencies determined experimentally are 15.5 and 35.4 Hz.\nThe large discrepancy in natural frequency between\nthe NASTRAN calculated and the experimentally determined bending vibration is\nprimarily attributed to the difference in the bending stiffness of the pivot\nshaft including its boundary support between the structure model analyzed and\nthe experimental test set-up.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe application of NASTRAN to solve static and dynamic problems of\ncomplicated structuresis convenient and powerful. There are, however, many\npitfalls and errors. Hence, results from NASTRAN must be scrutinized very\ncarefully whenever a new application is undertaken. In view of the substantial computational effort required in reducing the stiffness and mass matrices with Guyan Reduction it may be advantageous in some instances to construct a new structural model with fewer grid points for dynamic analysis.\n\nTABLE I.- COMPARISON OF NASTRAN AND TEST VERTICAL DEFLECTIONS\n\n--\n\nPoint\n1\n2A\n\n2B\n3A\n\n3B\n4\n5\n6\nI\\)\n\n\\Jl\n--.J\n\n,,\n\n/\n\n/\n\n- -- - - - - --9\n\n6\nI., _ _ _ _ _ -\n\n-- ;;;;:-?\n\n-\n\n.-<:\'-\n\nVertical deflection, cm\nR.T.\n422\xc2\xb0 K\nTest NASTRAN Test NASTRAN\n40.4l\n38.1\n35.8\n37. 72\n40.89\n41.7\n43.89\n---- 48.84 52.l 52.63\n48.44\n45.u\n45.7\n------- 43.26 48.8 46.38\nl8.64\n20.3\nl9.6l\n24.9\n28.4\n24.66\n23.32\n29.5\n28.30\n31.8\n34.5\n29.92\n\n----\n\nPoint\n7\n8\n9\nlO\nll\nl2\n\nl3\n14\n\nVertical deflection, cm\nR.

Jones and Larry D. Pinson\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nA normal mode analysis of the complete Viking launch vehicle (stage 1shutdown configuration) using a modification of NASTRAN version (11.1.0) on the\nCDC 6600 computer system is presented. The operational and logistics problems\ndiscussed in this paper are typical of those encountered in the use of NASTRAN\nfor any large problem. The vehicle is divided Into three basic substructures\nwhich are modeled and checked separately, then joined to yield a complete,\nunreduced model of the system. Eigenvalues are extracted using the inverse\npower method. The results of this study demonstrate the broad versatility of\nNASTRAN for simultaneously modeling structures by direct matrix input, general\nelements, and rigid links along with the standard library of finite elements.\nIt also indicates the large computer time requirements of NASTRAN for extracting\nroots of large order matrices.\nINTRODUCTION\nAssembly of a complete finite element model of the Viking launch vehicle\nand spacecraft system yields a relatively large composite model (greater than\n900 elastic degrees of freedom and 500 dynamic degrees of freedom). Eigenvalue\nanalyses of such large models with unreduced dynamic degrees of freedom have\ntraditionally led to excessive computer run times and core storage requirements.\nHence, a modal synthesis (substructuring) procedure (reference 1) was adopted\nby the Viking project as the baseline approach for modal analyses.\nModal synthesis does not offer the degree of accuracy, the visibility of\nthe overall model definition, nor the ease of model changes afforded by a\ndirect use of the complete, unreduced model. A direct approach was selected\nfor the work being performed at the Langley Research Center (LRC) in support\nof the Viking project. This decision was based partially on the availability\nof the NASTRAN program (refs. 2, 3, and 4) which was formulated for treating\nlarge systems such as the Viking space vehicle. The objective of using the\ndirect approach was to provide a means for accurately and easily performing\ndynamics studies requiring parametric model changes and to provide a backup\nfor modal synthesis. The configuration analyzed was the Titan/Centaur/Viking\nspace vehicle at stage 1 shutdown.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present the LRC experience gained during\nthis invest igation on the application of NASTRAN to the eige nvalue analysis of\nthe Viking space vehicle. Particular emphasis is given to the flexibility of\n\nNASTRAN in synthesizing a composite structural model from substructure models\nwhich were generated independently.\nIt was known at the outset that for large problems, the current version of\nNASTRAN (11.1.0) would require excessive computation times on the Control Data\nCorp. (CDC) 6600 computers at LRC. The primary reason is that NASTRAN was\nwritten in double precision to yield 14-16 digits of accuracy. On the CDC 6000\nseries computers single precision gives about 14 digits of accuracy. The\nNASTRAN double precision code, thus, imposes unnecessarily large arithmetic\ncomputation times and storage requirements upon the CDC system. Further, the\nNASTRAN code uses an unsyrrmetric decomposition in the inverse power method of\neigenvalue extraction. This also produces a penalty for symmetric eigenvalue\nproblems because of unnecessary computations and storage requirements.\nBecause of the characteristics of the CDC computer, conversions were made\nin NASTRAN to utilize single precision arithmetic operations in the multiplyadd (MPYAD) routine, the equation solution (FBS) routine, and the symmetric\ndecomposition routine (SDCOMP). In addition, symmetric decomposition was\nadded to the inverse power method for root extraction. A complete account of\nthe modifications and their effects on storage and run times is given in\nreference 5. The output and input for the modified version of NASTRAN (11.1.2)\nused in the present study is identical to that of the standard version (11.1.0).\nAlthough none of the concepts used in this analysis are new, it is believed\nthat several of the adaptations are of general interest. The features of\nNASTRAN used in the modeling of the structure are discussed along with the\nproblems encountered.\nSYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nIn this section, a description of the physical system analyzed is given\nalong with a description of the finite element models used to represent the\nsystem.\nSystem Components\nThe Viking Space Vehicle at stage 1 shutdown is composed of the booster\nand the Viking spacecraft as shown in figure 1. The booster consists of the\nTitan I I 1-D first and second stages, the Centaur D- lT, and the shroud. The\nbooster weighs approximately 609 kN (137,000 lb) and is 48.13 m (157.9 ft)\nlong, including the length of the shroud.\nThe Viking spacecraft consists of the Centaur-Truss Adaptor, Viking\nTransition Adaptor, Viking Spacecraft Adaptor, Orbiter Bus, Viking Lander\nCapsule Adaptor, and the Viking Lander. This assemblage weighs approximately\n32 kN (7200 lb) and is 5.786 m (227.8 in.) in length, including all adaptor\nsections.\n\n266\n\nSubstructure Finite Element Models\nFor the purpose of this NASTRAN analysis the Viking Space Vehicle was\ndivided into three substructures. Referring to figure 1, the Viking Lander is\nconsidered as one of the substructures. Another substructure, the Viking\nOrbiter, constitutes the remainder of the Viking spacecraft. The third\nsubstructure, the booster, is considered to be made up of the expended Titan\nfirst-stage, the Titan second-stage (fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer), the\nCentaur, and the shroud.\nLander model.- The finite element dynamic model of the Viking Lander was\ngenerated from an existing "Mar\'tin-Denver Space Frame Program" finite element\nmodel\nOf the three substructures comprising the Viking Space Vehicle, the\nMarti~ Marietta Corp. (MMC) lander model lent itself to the most straightforward\nadaptation to NASTRAN. This model is made up of 73 grid points, 42 massless\nrods, 87 massless bars, 111 concentrated translational masses, and 21 inertias.\nOrbiter model.- The finite element dynamic model of the Viking Orbiter w~s\n11\ngenerated from an existing Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Stru~t~ral Analysis\nand Matrix Interpretive System" (SAMIS), (references 6 and 7), f1n1te element\nmodel\nThe JPL model consists of 180 grid points, 106 massless rods, 57 massless bars, 109 rigid links, and read-in mass and stiffness.matrice 7\xe2\x80\xa2 The\nread-in stiffness matrices were used to represent the torsional stiffness of\nthe packing between the bus rings and the combined stiffness of the\nTransition and Centaur Truss Adap~ors. The total mass of the elastic Orbiter\nand rigid Lander was represented by a read-in mass matrix.\nThe SAMIS technique for rigidly linking two points is through the use of\nSAMIS substitute grid points." Since this technique is not avanable in\nNASTRAN, multipoint constraints (discussed in a subsequent section) were used\nas a replacement.\n\n11\n\nBooster.- The NASTRAN finite element dynamic model of the booster was\ngenerated from two sources -- a finite element model developed by MMC and basic\ndata (AE, El, GJ). Grid points were located on the booster centerline and\nwere connected with general elements or, where possible, with bar elements.\nStructural mass was lumped at the grid points and each geometric grid point\nwas allowed six degrees of freedom (d.o.f.). The basic structural model is\nillustrated in figure 2. Since the shroud encapsulates both the payload and\nthe Centaur stage, the centerlines of both these components coincide. In\nfigure 2 the shroud model is shown offset from the centerline for clarity.\nIn addition to the basic structural model shown, spring-mass systems were\nattached to the geometric grid points in order to represent branch components\nsuch as engines and sloshing liquids. The nonsloshing portion of liquid in\npropellant tanks was distributed to the geometric grid points as though it\nwere structural mass while the sloshing portion of liquid was attached to the\nappropriate geometric grid point through a spring. These masses were presumed\nto act in pitch and yaw. Longitudinally, a different spring-mass system was\nused to represent the liquid. In this direction the entire liquid mass within\na tank was lumped and springs were attached between that mass and grid points\n\nat both ends of the tank. The engines were attached at appropriate geometric\ngrid points in pitch, yaw, and roll by use of a six-by-six mass matrix. In\nthe longitudinal direction, engines were attached to these grid points through\nsprings.\nThe resulting model of the booster consists of 49 grid points, 13 general\nelements, 35 bar elements, 23 scalar springs, 75 scalar (1 d . o.f.) masses and\n63 concentrated (6 d.o.f.) masses. Various combinations of scalar and\nconcentrated mass were used to define the total mass at the grid points.\nNASTRAN MODELING PROCEDURES AND INNOVATIONS\nThe formulation of the composite Viking Space Vehicle was divided into\ntwo phases. The first phase consisted of defining, in terms of NASTRAN input,\nacceptable models representing each of three substructures. Secondly, these\nmodels were combined into one model representing the composite space vehicle.\nBoth phases included the use of global and secondary coordinate systems,\nmultipoint constraint relations, read-in matrices, general elements, and bulk\ndata logistics strategy.\nSelection of Global Coordinate System\nThe three right-handed rectangular coordinate systems used in this\nanalysis are shown in figure 3. These are the same coordinate systems used by\nthe contractors in the development of the substructural models. The system\ndescribing the Orbiter was chosen as the global and displacement coordinate\nsystem. This selection eliminates the requirement for transforming the\n11\nread-i~ 1 stiffness and mass matrices associated with the Orbiter.\nBulk Data Logistics\nThe combined model of the Viking Space Vehicle was described by 4447 bulk\ndata cards. This volume of input data increases the likelihood of errors and\nthe logistics of bulk data handling can become, at best, time consuming.\nMany of these logistics problems were eliminated by the methods discussed in\nthe following sections.\nElement numbering.- A reduction of the overall modeling complexity was\nachieved by breaking the model down into three substructures which could be\nmodeled and checked out independently. Unique blocks of numbers were assigned\nto each portion of the structure to label the elements.\nThe existing grid point sequencing of each substructure started with grid\npoint one. Since each grid point must have a unique number, a block of numbers\nfrom 1 to 10,000 was assigned to the booster and shroud; 10,001 to 20,000 to\nthe orbiter; and numbers greater than 20,000 to the lander. By adding 10,000\nand 20,000 to the existing grid point labels for the Orbiter and Lander,\n\n268\n\nrespectively, the initial grid point labeling of all three substructures was\npreserved as the three right-hand digits, Large gaps existed in the grid\npoint numbering, however, this did not create any problem because of the dual\ninternal-external grid point labeling system of NASTRAN.\nIn addition to a unique numbering system for grid points, all bulk data\ncards (material, property, mass, continuation identifications, etc.) were\ngiven unique identifications using a similar block numbering scheme.\nSubstructure orientated bulk data cards.- There are certain bulk data\ncards which can be used to supply repetitive input, One such card is the\n11\nBAROR11 card which allows all bar elements indicated to have the orientation\nspecified on this card. Another bulk data card, the 11 WTMASS 11 parameter,\nscales all mass entries by the multiplier indicated, Both devices can\neffectively be used to define a complete structure, However, these features\nwere avoided in the modeling of substructures because they were not applicable\nto each substructure of the composite model.\nMultipoint Constraint Relations\nExtensive use was made of the multipoint constraint (MPC) relationship in\nthe substructure model of the Orbiter and in the composite structural model.\nBoth the use and method of formulation are discussed in the following sections.\nUse of multipoint constraint relations.- The use of multipoint constraint\nrelations in the formulation of the analytical model served two functions.\nThe first use consisted of defining rigid links to represent portions of\nstructure. This procedure was used extensively to model solar panels, links\nbetween elastic grid points and mass entries (figure 4-a), and structural\noffsets (figure 4-b).\nThe second use consisted of providing a means of joining the substructural\nmodels together. The juncture at the Viking Orbiter/Lander interface is made\nat three locations. The MPC relationships were written with coefficients\nobtained by redefining the juncture coord-inates of the Lander in the displacement coordinate systems. This procedure is always used to obtain coefficients\nfor MPC relationships when joining structures with grids not defined in the\ndisplacement coordinate system. It should be emphasized that this procedure\nis not discussed in the NASTRAN manuals.\nThe juncture of the Orbiter to the booster model was different since the\nbooster is essentially a stick model. Points at the base of the Centaur Truss\nAdaptor were rigidly linked to a point along the centerline of the booster.\nThis point was, in turn, rigidly linked to the elastic grid representing the\ntop of the Centaur.\nFormulation of multipoint constraint relations.- To facilitate the use of\nMPC\'s in the representation of rigid links and to minimize input errors, a\ncomputer program was written, Input to this program was in the form of NASTRAN\nbulk data grid cards and a list of both the independent and dependent grid\n\npoints. The program output provides punched MPC bulk data cards for direct\nuse in NASTRAN.\nThe computer generated MPC equations are linear and are of the general\nform\n( 1)\n\nwhere An is the coordinate coefficient of the displacement un. The\nindependent coordinate is always written in terms of the dependent coordinate.\nA rigid link joining two points in space can be described by a set of six\nlinear equations involving coordinates of the related points -- three\ntranslation equations and three rotation equations.\nFigure 5 shows two points in space, A and B. These two points are linked\n11\ntogether rigidly with point 11 A chosen to be dependent on the motion of\n11\n11\n1\npoint B.\nThe translation of 11 A r in terms of t1B 11 is expressed by,\nUXA - UXB + Ug\n\nUYA - UYB + Ug\n\nUzA - UzB + ug\n\nand the rotation of\nug\n\nUg\n\n270\n\nXA\n\nYA\n\n11\n\nYs\n\n2B\n\nXB\n\n(ZB - ZA) - Ug\n\n(XB - XA) - ug\n\n{YB - y A) - Ug\n\n11\nA in terms of\n\n- ug\n\n- U9\n\nXB\n\nYB\n\n11\n\nZB\n\nXB\n\nYB\n\n(YB - YA)\n\n=0\n\n(Zs - ZA)\n\n=0\n\n(2)\n\n(XB - XA) = 0\n\nB11 is expressed by,\n\n=0\n= 0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the X, Y, Z refer to the coordinatesof the indicated point; ux, uy, uz\ndenote the translational displacement in the X, Y, Z directions; ug , ug ,\nX\n\nug\n\nz\n\ny\n\ndenote the rotational displacement about the X, Y, Z axes, respectively.\n\nFor the composite model 109 grid points were rigidly linked in this\nfashion in all six directions, and 22 grids were linked rigidly in five\ndirections. This results in a reduction of 764 independent degrees of freedom.\nRead-In Matrices\nNASTRAN rigid format 3 (normal mode analysis) does not provide for matrices\nto be 11 read-in11 directly. A part of the data describing the Viking Orbiter\nstructure was supplied as stiffness and mass matrices. A DMAP alteration\nallowing direct matrix input was therefore made and is shown in the example\nbelow.\nALTER 26,29\nMTRXIN, ,MATPOOL,EQEXIN,SIL,/STIF,WTRl,/V,N,LUSET/V,N,NOMl/V,N,NOM2/\nC,N,O $\nSMAl\nCSTM,MPT,ECPT,GPCT,DIT/KGGY,,GPST/V,N,NOGENL/V,N,NOK4GG $\nADD\nKGGY,STIF/KGGX/C,N, (1.o,o.o)/C,N, (1.0,0.0) $\nCHKPNT KGGX,GPST $\nSMA2\nCSTM,MPT,ECPT,GPCT,DIT/MGGl,/V,Y,WTMASS=l.O/V,N,NOMGG/\nV,N,NOBGG/V,Y,COUPBAR=-1 $\nSAVE\nNOMGG $\nADD\nMGGl ,WTRl/MGG/C,N, (1.0,0.0)/C,N, (1.0,0,0) $\nENDALTER\nThe stiffness matrix to be 11 read-in 11 is labeled 11 STI F11 and the mass\nmatrix 11 WTRl.\' 1 Both of these matrices are coded on 11 DMIG11 and are "read-in"\nthrough the instruction entitled 11 MTRXIN." The output from the stiffness\nmatrix generator is relabeled KGGY rather than KGGX in order to avoid relabeling\nof the stiffness matrix several times later in the DMAP sequence. KGGY is then\nadded to STIF, the read-in stiffness, with the resulting summation being the\nsame size of KGGY. Since neither KGGY or STIF is to be scaled the real portion\nof the matrix multiplier is unity. The output from this module is then checkpointed. A similar procedure is followed in the addition of the internally\ngenerated mass matrix 11 MGGl" and the read-in mass matrix WTRl.\nThe two read-in stiffness matrices describing the Orbiter model were\ncombined and read-in as a single matrix having 1809 nonzero terms. The readin mass matrix had 196 nonzero elements. Input of the nonzero matrix elements\nto nine significant figures (including signs and decimals) was accomplished\nusing the large field DMIG bulk data cards. A total of 2206 bulk data cards\nwe re requ i red.\n\n271\n\nGeneral Element\nIn order to compare the NASTRAN booster model with the existing MMC model\nit was desirable to maintain the same grid points. General elements were,\ntherefore, used to replace the nonuniform bar elements in the MMC model. This\napproach eliminated the need for placing additional grid points at each\nlocation corresponding to a change in the properties of the cross section.\nFlexibility matrices for the general elements were generated by using\nNASTRAN rigid format l (static analysis). Each variable-property beam was\nmodeled as a series of stepped uniform beams cantilevered between the MMC grid\npoints. The flexibility matrices for all the general elements were generated\nin a single run by coding the data for all the cantilever substructures as\nthough they were one structure. Four subsets of unit loads were simultaneously\napplied to all substructures, yielding four solution vectors. Only four\nsubsets were needed instead of six because of pitch-yaw symmetry. Each solution\nvector, therefore, contained one column of the flexibility matrix for each\ncantilever substructure.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSignificant results of the analysis are presented and discussed in this\nsection. Data which support the eigenvalue correlation between contractor\nanalyses and NASTRAN results are examined. In addition, eigenvalue data are\npresented for the composite model along with selected structural plots for\nboth the undeformed and modally deformed models. Finally, operational problems\nencountered in the analysis are discussed along with methods for alleviation.\nSubstructure Eigenvalue Correlation\nThe basis for establishing confidence in substructure modeling is the\ncomparison of eigenvalues obtained from contractor finite element analyses with\nthose eigenvalues calculated with NASTRAN. The modal synthesis approach used\nby the MMC employed cantilevered modes for both the Lander and the Orbiter\n(with an attached rigid Lander). Further, free-free modes were employed for\nthe booster (with an attached rigid spacecraft). These same conditions were\nduplicated in the eigenvalue analyses of the NASTRAN substructure models so\nthat the comparison would be direct. The results obtained for each substructure\nmodel are discussed in the following subsections.\nLander model.- The cantilevered model of the Viking Lander contains 402\nelastic degrees of freedom and 132 dynamic degrees of freedom, i.e., degrees\nof freedom with mass. The 270 degrees of freedom associated with the massless\ncoordinates were eliminated by the Guyan reduction method leaving a total\nsystem of order 132.\nAll eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors for the first 40 modes were\ncomputed using the Givens method. A tabulation of the first 28 frequencies\n\n272\n\ncalculated by MMC and by LRC using NASTRAN is given in table I. Note the\nexcellent overall agreement between the frequencies with maximum deviation of\napproximately 4.6 percent for the 16th mode based on the MMC value. In general,\nthe NASTRAN results gave slightly higher frequencies with exact agreement to\ntwo place accuracy for seven of the 28 modes given. This close agreement\nsupports the validity of the NASTRAN model.\nOrbiter model.- The Givens method of root extraction was also used in the\nNASTRAN formulation to compute all eigenvalues and the first 25 eigenvectors\nfor the cantilevered Viking Orbiter. The system was represented by 148 dynamic\nd.o.f. and 219 elastic d.o.f. The original system of equations had 764 dependent\ncoordinates eliminated by the MPC equations and 71 massless coordinates\neliminated by the Guyan reduction.\nShown in table II is a comparison of the frequencies from the NASTRAN\nanalysis with those obtained from the JPL SAMIS analysis. Again, very good\n\xc2\xb7 agreement is indicated by the frequency comparisons with the exception of the\nfirst two frequencies. These frequencies are associated with localized solar\npanel motions and do not represent major structural modes. This correlation\nfor the Orbiter substructure model validates the procedure for DMAP\nalterations discussed in a previous section entitled 11 Read-ln Matrices.i 1 In\naddition, the validity of the MPC representation of rigid links is verified.\nBooster model.- The free-free model of the Viking booster has 310 elastic\nd.o.f. and 236 dynamic d.o.f. The inverse power method was used to extract\nthe first 35 eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors.\nA comparison between the natural frequencies generated using NASTRAN and\nthose generated by MMC using modal synthesis is shown in table I I I. Good\nagreement is indicated except for two double frequencies which were not\npredicted by NASTRAN. These correspond to two lateral modes. Discussions\nwith the contractor and comparison of mode shapes indicates that the\ndiscrepancy is due to different methods of treatment of the liquid propellants\nin the second-stage. This correlation tends to verify the modeling of the\nnonuniform bar elements with general elements. These results are also\nindicative of the accuracy of the modal approach used by MMC.\nPlotting.- Structural plots, both undeformed and modally deformed proved\nto be very useful in the development of accurate mathematical models. Initially,\nplots were made of each substructure and of the composite structure in order\nto verify geometry. Figure 6 illustrates the undeformed computer plot for\nthe combined Viking Orbiter and Lander model. From this view and several\nothers, the complete geometry was checked.\nAn important finding was observed from a plot of the first major\nlongitudinal mode of this structure as shown on figure 7, Note that excessive\ndeformations are exhibited by the Bioshield separation ring in the upper area\nof the Lander. This plot resulted in a MMC revision in the modeling of that\npart of the structure to eliminate the unrealistic elastic deformation.\n\n273\n\nComposite Structure Eigenvalues\nThe complete NASTRAN model of the Viking Space Vehicle was synthesized _\n..\nfrom the substructure models representing the Orbiter, Lander, and Booster.\nThese components were merged by using MPC relationships and coordinate\ntransformations. The combined model is represented by 931 elastic d.o.f. and\n516 dynamic d.o.f. Eigenvalues for 45 modes (all less than 16 Hz) were\ncalculated using the inverse power method and are listed in table IV. No\ncomparative data is available for the exact configuration analyzed. However,\nsome measure of confidence in the results is obtained by correlating the\nfrequencies of the composite model with those of the substructure. For\nexample, the first eight roots of table IV (all below 2 Hz) agree very closely\nwith the eight roots (four double roots) of table Ill. This good agreement\nis due to the near rigid body behavior of the spacecraft below 2 Hz. In\naddition, the ninth root of table IV, which is associated with localized\npanel motion on the Orbiter is the same as the fundamental Orbiter root\ngiven in tab 1e I l \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe Givens method was not used for the eigenvalue analysis of the\ncomposite model since its size exceeded the storage capacity of the LRC\ncomputers. In addition, a Guyan reduction was not used to reduce the size\nof the problem to its dynamic d.o.f. since run times increased when this\nprocedure was attempted.\nOperational Problems\nSeveral NASTRAN problems were encountered which dealt with either\nprogram errors, or large computing times. These problems are discussed in\nthis section along with possible measures for avoiding such problems.\nRun time requirements.- Perhaps the most significant problem encountered\nin the course of this study is the long times required by NASTRAN to compute\neigenvalues and eigenvectors. Using the modified version of NASTRAN (11. 1.2)\nand approximately 40 percent of the CDC 6600 digital computers storage, the\ncentral processing time (cpu) was in excess of three minutes for each root\nextracted. Practically, this situation allowed only a few eigenvalues and\neigenvectors to be computed since approximately 27.3 hours (cpu) would be\nrequired to find all the roots. It is noted that large time requirements are\ninherent in the tracking method for root extraction rather than in the NASTRAN\nsystem. Therefore, in order to reduce time requirements, a substantial reduction\nin the size of the matrices representing the model would be required.\nCheckpoint dictionary omissions.- A checkpoint dictionary problem has been\ndetected which is associated with secondary restarts. Not all tables and\nmatrices are transferred from the old problem tape to the new problem tape.\nNeither are all the required tables which are not transferred, regenerated\nwithout specific DMAP alterations. This presents problems in such areas as\nplotting. For example, if plots are to be made from secondary restart tapes,\nthe DMAP instruction 11 Geometry Processor 2, 11 might be reexecuted to develop\nthe 11 Element Connection Table." A check can be made from the checkpoint\n\ndictionary listing prior to reexecution, to determine if needed information\nis on the old problem tape. In the event a needed table does not appear in the\ncheckpoint dictionary, it can be regenerated by 11 alterating ou~ 1 the DMAP\nstatement which generated the table initially and replacing it with the\nstatement which was eliminated.\nImplementation of the General Element\nIt was found that errors were present in certain modes of operation\ninvolving use of the general element. Incorrect results are generated when the\nrigid body matrix is input directly. However, when NASTRAN is allowed to\ngenerate its own rigid body matrix correct results are obtained. Also, NASTRAN\nwould not execute if the number of general elements used was even. As a\nconsequence when the Titan model, with an odd number of general elements (11),\nwas combined with the shroud (3 general elements) and Centaur models (the\nCentaur model had no general elements), the resulting booster model with an\neven number of general elements would not execute. To circumvent this problem,\none general element was approximated with a series of three bar elements at\nthe top of the shroud. The resulting booster model with an odd number of\ngeneral elements (13) executed correctly.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nExperience gained with the application of NASTRAN to the Viking Space\nVehicle in the stage l shutdown configuration has been presented. The more\nimportant aspects of this study are presented.\nComputing time associated with eigenvalue extraction for the composite\nmodel (approximately 900 elastic d.o.f.) made computation of more than a few\nroots impractical. Even with the speed improvements incorporated into NASTRAN\nversion (11.1.2), the direct eigenvalue analysis of large unreduced structural\nproblems is not a practical approach. Use of the Guyan reduction to eliminate\nonly the massless d.o.f. did not alleviate this time problem. However, a\nreduction in computing time might be achieved by a larger reduction to 200300 dynamic d.o.f. This reduction procedure is the only alternative presently\navailable in NASTRAN to modal synthesis.\nThe modeling flexibility of NASTRAN was demonstrated by use of adaptations\nin the program of several rather specialized features found in other finite\nelement programs. In the present application, the ability to incorporate\nscalar masses, scalar springs, flexibility coefficients, direct input matrices,\nand rigid links was exercised. The ability to represent several portions of a\ns tructure in different coordinate systems is found to be an extremely useful\nfe ature .\nPlotting of the undeformed mode l, in the highly versatile manner allowed\nby the program, provides a che ck on the geometric representation. In addition,\nthe modally deformed plots provide a qualitative evaluation of the physical\nproperties of the elements comprising the model.\n\n275\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nHruda, Richard F.: Modal Coupling Program and Report.

Herting, Jerrard A Joseph, Loren R. Kuusinen,\nand Richard H. MacNeal\nThe MacNeal-Schv:endler Corporation\nSUi-\'i:,,f>.RY\n\nThis paper describes an approach to the solution of acoustic modes in\na cavity containing both axisymmetric regions and evenly spaced radial\nslots.\n\nA finite element approach is used with degrees of freedom taken as\n\nthe harmonic coefficients in a Fourier expansion of the pressure.\n\nIf the\n\nassumptions are made that the radial slots are evenly spaced around the\ncircumference and that the circumferential pressure gradient within each\nslot is negligible, the equations for the harmonic coefficients become\nuncoupled.\n\nFormulas are derived by which the finite element stiffness and\n\nmass matrices may be computed.\n\nIn addition, special terms are derived to\n\naccount for rapid expansion of the flew in the opening between the slots\nand the circular cavity .\n\nResults are given for three operational solid\n\nrocket motors having four, six, and t1-1elve radial slots respectively.\nComparisons with other analytic results and with experimental results are\ngiven where these data are available.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThroughout engineering history the different disciplines of applied\nmechanics have borrowed formulations and methods from each other in a\ncross pollinization process known as the mathematical analog.\n\nIn partic-\n\nular, structural dynamicists have freely used the methods of electrical\ncircuit analysis to formulate their equations and they have employed\nelectric analog computers [l] to solve their problems.\n\nWith the advent\n\nof the digital computer, the methods used in structural analysis have been\nimproved to the point where a very sophisticated capability now exists in\nstructural analysis computer programs.\n\nIt is therefore, appropriate to\n\nconsider using that capability for the solutions of analogous problems in\nother disciplines, including electromagnetics, fluid dynamics, and heat\ntransfer.\nThe subject of this paper is the solution of acoustic problems using\nfinite element methods adopted from structural analysis.\n\nThe NASTRAN\n\n(NASA STRuctural ANaly sis) program [2] has been modified to solve acoustic\nproblems by substituting pressure for displacement, and fluid particle accelerations for the components of internal structural force.\n\nThe NASTRAN program\n\nis basically a system for solving matrix equations of high order.\nmass, damping, and st iffn ess matrices in its solutions.\n\nIt uses\n\nWhen a fluid is\n\nanalyzed instead of a structure, its properties produce analogous matrices\nhaving different physical meaning, but with the same form.\n\n286\n\nThus NASTRAN\n\nprovides the capability to solve linear fluid problems with hundreds or\nthousands of degrees of freedom including statics (potential flow),\nnormal modes, frequency response, and transient response.\n\nThe modifications\n\nof NASTRAN that provide the capability are documented in additions to the\nNASTRAN Manuals, [2], [3], and [4], and in an applications report, [5],\nwhich gives detailed instructions for using the new acoustic capability.\nAlthough the fluid models presented in this paper are restricted to\na locally homogeneous compressible fluid having small motions, the capability\nis present to expand the sophistication of the solution to include additional effects, such as those caused by solid parti~les suspended in the\nfluid, and by finite ambient flow velocity (Mach Number effec t).\nThe immediate motivation for the work described in the paper was the\nneed for a better means to calculate the vibration mode frequencies and\nmode shapes of the interior cavities of solid propellant rocket motors.\nThe cavities in functional rocket motors generally have complex shapes\nthat include a number of symmetrically placed slots (or fins) cut into the\npropellant, whose purpose is to increase the area of the burning surface.\nThe acoustic analysis of these cavities could be modelled with three\ndimensional finite elements that fill the entire cavity.\n\nSince solution\n\ncosts increase roughly as the cube of the number of finite elements, there\nis good reason to use symmetry properties to reduce problem size.\nThe approach that will be described reduces the problem from three to\ntwo dimensions by means of assumptions regarding the variation of the\npressure in the circumferential direction.\n\nWithin the central axisymmetric\n\ncore of the cavity the pressure is expanded in a finite Fourier series with\nrespect to the circumferential coordinate, having a number of terms equal\nto the number of slots.\n\nThe pressure in the slotted region is also expended\n\nin a Fourier series but within each slot the pressure gradient in the\ncircumferential direction is assumed to be zero.\n\nWith this assumption, and\n\nwith appropriate approximations to the boundary conditions at the interface between the central cavity and the slots, the Fourier pressure coefficients become uncoupled from each other.\n\nThey are, of course, functions\n\nof the (r,z) coordinates in a radial plane.\n\nThe solution for each coeffi-\n\ncient may, accordingly, be accomplished with two dimensional finite element s .\nThe reduction from three to two dimensions is beneficial because it\nreduces complexity and solution cost.\n\nIt also introduces the concept that\n\nthe vibration modes may be separated into groups according to the number\nof waves (n) in the circumferen~ial direction.\n\nDue to the assumption of\n\nzero circumferential pressure gradient in the slots, the approach is more\naccurate for n small than for n large and also more accurate for narrow\nslots than for wide slots.\n\nNo meaningful information at all is produced\n\nfor n larger than half the number of slots.\napplication.\n\nThus the approach has limited\n\nIt has, however, been tested by solving a variety of realistic\n\nproblems and comparing solutions with experimental results from cold flow\nmodels.\n\nThese solutions will be presented after the theory has been\n\ndescribed in greater detail .\n\n288\n\nTHEORY\n\nAcoustic vibrations are governed by the wave equation, which can be\nstated in terms of the pressure fluctuation pas\n2\n1 a P\n--2\nB cH\n\nV\xe2\x80\xa2 ( _!_ Vp)\np\n\n(

that\n\nhave no direct connection to the central cavity may be attached to the slot\nregion.\n\nThe entire cross section is covered with triangular and quadrilateral\n\nfinite elements connected to grid points at which the pressure is defined.\nAlong boundaries between the slot region and axisymmetric cavities, two\ndegrees of freedom are defined and interconnected by the stiffness matrix\ngiven in Equation (48).\nThe input data to the computer consists of the locations and identifications of the grid points, the identification of the finite elements and\ntheir connections to grid points, and the physical properties, p, B, and\nslot width w, all of which may vary with position.\nNo special procedures are required to account for the boundary condJtions at rigid surfaces, which is an important aspect of the finite element\nmethod.\n\nAt nozzles and at other boundaries where the normal velocity\n\ndepends on the pressure, the relationship between velocity and pressure\nmay be represented by lumped impedance elements, see, for example, Ref. [8).\nThe complete analysis of a problem requires a solution for each set of\nterms in the Fourier series of pressure about the circumference.\n\nEach case,\n\nwhich is selected by the input value, n,

the validity of the theory and the correctness of\nthe implementation, a series of problems we re solved with the modified\nversion of NASTRAN.\n\nThese included a relatively simple test problem used\n\nto assess the accvracy of the assumptions for the radial slots, and three\nrealistic rocket motor cavities, with four, six, and twelve slots\nrespectively.\nThe test problem is illustrated in Figure 5; it consists of a central\ncavity and four slots .\n\nThe pressure distribution was assumed to be inde-\n\npendent of the location along the z axis and only l~teral modes (n = 1)\nwere considered.\n\nThe problem was solved with three different methods:\n\nMethod 1 used the theory described in preceding sections including the\nslot-cavity interconnection matrix.\n\nFifteen finite elements were located\n\nin a radial line, including nine in the slot region.\n\nMethod 2 used the\n\nsame data except that the interconnection stiffness matrix was replaced by\na rigid connection.\n\nIn Method 3, one-quarter of the cross section normal\n\nto the z axis was cut up into 94 two dimensional elements, see Figure 6.\nThe pressure along they axis was set equal to zero in order to provide\nthe proper boundary condition for lateral modes.\nThe lowest mode shapes and frequencies obtained with the three methods\nare comp~red in Figure 7,\n\nThe difference in frequency between Methods 1 and\n\n2 indicates that the slot-cavity correction matrix has\n\na\n\nmodest effect (5%).\n\nThe comparison between Methods 1 and 3 validates the approach used in\nMethod I for cavities with cross sections similar in shape to the test\nproblem.\n\nNo firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the magnitude of the\n\nerror in Method 1, because Method 3 is also an approximate method which is\nknown to give frequencies that are too high.\n\nThe first of the actual solid rocket motor cavities to be analyzed\nis the Minuteman III, Stage III, shown in Figure 8, together with the\nfinite element model used in its analysis.\n\nAs may be seen, it consists\n\nof six slots and a long slender central cavity of irregular shape.\nfinite element model contains approximately 130 grid points.\n\nThe\n\nThis motor\n\ncavity had previously been analyzed [9] with a finite element model based\n\non an electrical network analogy [10].\nmeasured in a cold-flow model~\n\nIn addition, vibration modes were\nVibration mode frequencies for two\n\ndifferent harmonic orders (n = 0 and n = 1) and for cavity dimensions\ncorresponding to two different burn times (t = 0 and t = 3 sec.) are\ncompared in Table 2.\nment.\n\nIt is seen that all results are in excellent agree-\n\nPressure distributions for two of the modes are presented in\n\nFigure 9.\nThe second rocket motor cavity is the Minuteman II, Stage III, shown\nin Figure 10.\n\nThe cavity includes four conical nozzle ports with attached\n\nconstant width slots, and a central cavity.\n\nThe treatment of the relatively\n\nbulbous nozzle ports as variable width slots constitutes a fairly severe\nstrain on the assumption of zero circumferential pressure gradient.\n\nThe\n\nentrance to the nozzle port is assumed closed in order to match available\nexperimental measurements on a cold flow model.\n\nThis assumption could be\n\nreplaced by an assumption of zero pressure or by an impedance relationship\nbetween pressure and normal velocity.\n\nThe configuration shown in Figure 10\n\nalso assumes that a two inch layer of propellant has burned away from the\nsurface of the cavity.\n\n307\n\nTable 2.\n\nNatural Frequencies for the Third Stage, Minuteman ill, Motor\nCavity\n\nBurn\nTime\n(sec.)\n\nFrequency, Hz\nHarmonic\n\nMode\nRef.\n\n[

Clary\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThis paper discusses the successful application of the NASA structural\nanalysis (NASTRAN) computer program for calculating the vibration characteristics of a variety of plate configurations. Calculated natural frequencies and\nnodal patterns are generally in good agreement with measured data for (1)\nresearch filamentary composite material plates, (2) wing flutter models fabricate~ with metal reinforced with composite material, and (3) a metal plate\nsupported on an elastic boundary.\nINTRODUCTION\nApplication of new design concepts and materials to structural plates\nwhich are employed in modern aircraft, spacecraft, and propulsion systems\nrequires the analysis of the vibration characteristics of a wide variety of\nplate configurations. These plates may be constructed with isotropic or\northotropic materials and may involve combinations of dissimilar materials.\nBoundaries may be free, fixed, or elastically restrained, and there may be\ninternal supports.\nIn an effort to determine the effectiveness of the NASTRAN program for\ncalculating structural vibration characteristics of plates, NASTRAN has been\napplied to a number of different plate configurations. This paper presents\nsome results from three of these studies summarized as follows:\n1 . Composite material plates.- An analytical and experimental study was\nmade on a series of filamentary composite material plates with all layers having\nthe same filament orientation . Natural frequencies and mode shapes were\nobtained as the filament orientation was varied from along the longest dimension of the plate to transverse to the longest dimension of the plate. This\nstudy is discussed in detail in reference 1 .\n2. Laminated wing models.- Analytical and experimental results have been\nobtained for a series of metal wing models reinforced with filamentary composite\nmaterial and for a series of bare aluminum wi ng models. The filament orientation was varied from along the wing chord to along the wing span. These\nmodels were fabricated for a program being conducted by Dr. Paul Cooper to\ndetermine flutter characteristics of composite material wing models.\n\n325\n\n3. Metal plate with a variable elastic boundary.- The influence of an\nelastic boundary condition on the vibration characteristics of a metal plate\nwas investigated using classical theory under a University Grant. These\nresults are presented in references 2 and 3. Results were obtained using the\nNASTRAN program and compared with results from the classical theory.\nEXPERIMENTAL AND .ANALYTICAL MODELS\nUnidirectional Composite Material Plates\nThe unidirectional composite material plates are illustrated in figure 1.\nThe plates were built up from layers of prepreg tape consisting of an epoxy\nmatrix reinforced with boron filaments. The tape was oriented so that all\nfilaments of each plate lie at the same angle with respect to the long axis of\nthe plate. The filament angle 0 was varied from o0 to 90\xc2\xb0 and the number of\nlayers n was varied from 6 to 24. This type of lay-up results in a highly\northotropic plate where Young\'s modulus in the direction of the filaments is\neight times that in the direction transverse to the filaments. Each plate was\n46.2 cm long and 7 cm wide. Tests were conducted with the plates having\nsimulated free boundary conditions.\nThe plates were represented mathematically as an assembly of quadrilateral\nplate (CQDPLT) elements (fig. 1) having consistent mass matrices (PAR.AM=\nCOUPMASS). In the analytical formulation underlying the NASTRAN elements, it\nis assumed that the element material is homogeneous. The orthotropic material\nproperties of each element were described by the material property matrix\n(MAT2 CARD). Material properties were taken from experimental data published\nin the literature. The mathematical model had 165 elements and 204 grid\npoints. The in-plane rotations and displacements were constrained to be zero.\nThe resulting model had 612 degrees of freedom. The inverse power method of\neigenvalue extraction was used to obtain the first 9 to 10 natural frequencies\nand mode shapes. A rough approximation of the frequency range of interest was\nobtained in advance using beam theory. The program computed all modes in the\nspecified range in one pass and gave three very good rigid body modes (near\nzero eigenyalues). This required approximately 2500 seconds of central\nprocessing time (CPU) and a total time of approximately 6700 seconds on the\nCDC 6600 computer.\nReinforced-Aluminum Wing Flutter Models\nA sketch of the reinforced plate models is shown in figure 2. Each plate\nwas tested with its root clamped in a massive backstop to simulate a fixed\nboundary condition. The plates were constructed with six layers of boron/epoxy\nplaced on each side of an aluminum plate. The boron/epoxy was laid up in a\nsymmetric manner about the aluminum core with the filament angle of the layers\nalt ernating between +8 and -8. Plates were constructed with filament angles\nof o0 , \xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0, and 90\xc2\xb0. Each plate was 106.7 cm wide at the root and 80.5 cm\nlong. An aluminum plate to be used as a control specimen and having the same\nplanform dimensions and a thickness of 0.64 cm was also tested and analyzed.\n\nThe plates were represented mathematically as an assembly of quadrilateral\nplate (CQDPLT) elements, and triangular plate (CTRPLT) elements having consistent mass matrices (PARAM = COUPMASS). It may be of interest to note the special way in which t he stiffnesses of these elements were put into NASTRAN. As\nstated previously, in the analytical formulation underlying the NASTRAN elements\nit is assumed that the element material is homogeneous. Thus it is not\npossible to input directly the properties of each layer of a laminated structure. For a homogeneous material, the plate flexural rigidities are obtained\ninternally in NASTRAN by multiplying the material modulus matrix by the inertia.\nFor these laminated plates, the flexural rigidities were calculated externally\nusing laminated plate theory. The rigidities were input to NASTRAN in place of\nthe material modulus matrix and the inertia was input as unity. It should be\nnoted that this procedure does not provide a means for obtaining stresses\nin each layer directly from NASTRAN as would be desired for detailed stress\nanalysis of laminated structures. There exists a need for special elements if\nNASTRAN is to be used efficiently for complete analysis of laminates.\nThe mathematical model had 48 elements and 58 grid points. The in-plane\nrotations and displacements were constrained to be zero. The resulting model\nhad 174 degrees of freedom. The Givens\' method of eigenvalue extraction was\nused to obtain all the natural frequencies and the first ll mode shapes. As a\npoint of interest, it is noted that it was not necessary to OMIT the rotational\ndegrees of freedom because consistent mass matrices were used. When lumped\nmasses are used, zero inertias are associated with the rotations and OMITS are\nrequired .if the NASTRAN Givens\' procedure is to succeed. The time for the\neigenvalue solution was approximately 330 seconds of central processing time\nand the total time was approximately 1270 seconds .\nIsotropic Plate With Elastic Restraints at Boundary\nA sketch of the plate with three edges simply supported and one edge\nelastically restrained is presented in figure 3. The plate is 76.2 cm long,\n38.1 cm wide, and 0.32 cm thick. Three edges were simply supported and there\nwere elastic restraints at the other edge. The plate was represented mathematically for NASTRAN as an assembly of quadrilateral plate (CQDPLT) el ements\nhaving consistent mass matrices. The mathematical model had 225 elements and\n256 grid points. The in-plane rotations and displacements were constrained\nto be zero. The resulting model had 768 degrees of freedom. The elastic\nrestraints were represented as 16 springs (CELAS2 CARD) evenly spaced along\none edge. The inverse power method of eigenvalue extraction was used to obtain\nthe first five natural frequencies and mode shapes. The frequency range of\ninterest was obtained in advance from results published in reference 3. The\nprogram computed all modes in the specified range in one pass. This required\napproximately 1600 seconds of central processing time and the total time was\napproximately 4200 seconds.\n\n327\n\nPRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nUnidirectional Composite Material Plates\nMeasured and calculated nodal patterns were classified as either beam type\nor plate type. Typical patterns for the first and second beam-type and platetype modes are presented in figure 4. In all cases, the nodal patterns were\nhighly dependent on the filament angle 8 (see ref. 1). For the beam-type\nmodes, the slope of the node lines varied as much as 45\xc2\xb0 as the filament angle\nwas varied. For the plate-type modes the nodal patterns varied from a combination of straight lines intersecting each other to curved lines sloping away\nfrom each other. In all cases, there was very good agreement between the\nmeasured nodal patterns and those calculated by NASTRAN.\nThe natural frequencies were also highly dependent on the filament\nangle as shown for the beam-type modes in figure 5 and the plate-type modes in\nfigure 6. These data are for plates having 24 layers of composite material but\nsimilar data were obtained for plates with 6 and 12 layers. The natural\nfrequencies of the first four beam-type modes decreased significantly (approximately 60 percent) as the filament angle increased from o0 to 60\xc2\xb0. There was\nlittle change in frequency with a further increase in filament angle up to\n90\xc2\xb0. In general, there was good agreement between the measured and calculated\nfrequencies for the beam-type modes.\nThe natural frequencies of the first two plate-type modes increased by\napproximately 90 percent as the filament angle increased from o0 to 30\xc2\xb0 and\ndecreased with a further increase in filament angle. In general, there was\ngood agreement between the measured and calculated frequencies. However, it\nshould be pointed out that for the plates having 6 and 12 layers with a filament angle of o0 the agreement was not quite so good.\nReinforced-Aluminum Wing Flutter Models\nThe first wing model studied was the aluminum control panel. The\nmeasured and calculated natural frequencies and nodal patterns are presented in\nfigure 7. There is very good agreement between the measured and calculated\ndata. The maximum error between the calculated and measured frequencies of\nthe first 10 modes is 8.3 percent. Only one set of patterns is presented since\nthere were no discernible differences between the measured and calculated\nnodal patterns.\nResults for the aluminum panels reinforced with boron/epoxy material are\nshown for filament angles of o0 , \xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0, and 90\xc2\xb0 in figure 8. In cases where\nthere were no discernible differences between the measured and calculated\nnodal patterns only one set of patterns is presented. For the panel with\n8 = 90\xc2\xb0 (fig. 8(a)), there is good agreement between the measured and calculated frequencies. All of the calculated frequencies are higher than those\nmeasured. The average error for the first 10 modes is 6.3 percent. The\ncalculated nodal patterns are in very good agreement with the measured nodal\n\n328\n\npatterns for the first six modes. For the higher modes, there are some\ndifferences between the calculated and measured node lines but, in general,\nthe overall patterns are very similar.\nFor the\nin very good\nthe first 10\ngenerally in\nences in the\n\npanel with 9 = \xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0 (fig. 8(b)), the calculated frequencies are\nagreement with the measured frequencies. The average error for\nmodes is only 5.2 percent. The calculated nodal patterns are\nvery good agreement with the measured patterns; with some differsecond, seventh, ninth, and tenth modes.\n\nFor the panel with 9 = o0 (fig. 8(c)) the calculated frequencies show\nonly fair agreement with the measured frequencies. The average error for the\nfirst 10 modes is 11.l percent. For the third mode the error is 27.4 percent.\nThere are also significant differences between the calculated and measured\nnodal patterns but, in general, the overall patterns are similar. The reason\nfor these discrepancies has not been determined at this writing. However, it\nshould be noted that for some of the unidirectional composite material plates\nhaving a filament angle of o0 similar discrepancies were present.\nPlate With Elastic Restraints at Boundary\nEffects of the elastic edge restraints on the natural frequencies of the\nfirst three modes of the plate are shown in figure 9. When the elastic edge\nrestraint is zero, the edge is free; as the restraint is increased, the\nboundary condition approaches a simply supported condition. The natural\nfrequencies calculated using the NASTRAN program are in very good agreement\nwith those predicted with the closed-form solution using classical plate theory.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nComparison of results obtained with the NASTRAN computer program with\nresults from experiments and classical theory showed NASTRAN to be very effective in calculating the vibration characteristics of isotropic and orthotropic\nplates with free, fixed, and elastically restrained edges. Good results were\naJ..so obtained for plates laminated with dissimilar materials. However, there\nexists a need for special elements to improve the effectiveness of NASTRAN in\nanalyzing laminated structures.\n\n329\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nClary, Robert R.: Vibration Characteristics of Unidirectional Filamentary\nComposite Material Panels.

Grand.le and Carl E. Rucker\n\nNASA Langley Research _\nCenter\nSUMMARY\nResults obtained using a NASTRAN normal mode analys is of a nine-bay skinstringer panel 68.58 cm (27 inches) by 93,98 cm (37 inches) of typical aircraft construction are presented.\nThe aluminum panel was made up of a plate, Z section stringers, and\nchannel section frames and was assumed to have fully fixed edges. Stress and\nmode shape data for the lower order modes obtained from a NASTRAN analysis of a\n266-grid-point division of the panel are presented and compared with experimental data.\nINTRODUCTION\nAs part of Langley\'s research on the response and fatigue of aircraft\nstructures due to acoustic loading, programs are underway to determine the\neffectiveness of varying the substructure to control the response and sonic\nfatigue of skin-stringer type structures. In these programs, analytical\nmethods to evaluate response due to incremental changes in structural design\nare very useful. Among analytical methods used in these programs are NASTRAN\nand a special-purpose finite-element program. The finite-element program was\ndeveloped by the Lockheed-Georgia Company as part of an analytical/experimental\nstudy conducted under contract to the Langley Research Center. This study was\nmade on a typical aircraft type structural panel and the NASTRAN program was\napplied to obtain modes and stresses for this panel design.\nThis paper describes the nine-bay skin panel used in the study and presents\nthe results obtained from the experiments, the special-purpose analysis, and\nthe NASTRAN analysis. Presented are comparisons of the modal frequencies and\nstress values obtained from NASTRAN with those obtained from the experiment.\nAlso, the modal frequencies obtained from the NASTRAN are compared with those\nfrom the special-purpose program.\nDESCRIPTION OF PANEL STRUCTURE\nA flat aluminum skin-stringer panel constructed from channels and Z\nstringers bonded to the plate was used as the test structure. The panel was\n93,98 cm (37 inches) by 68.58 cm (27 inches), as shown in figure 1 . The skin\nthickness was 0.081 cm (0.032 inch), the channel thickness 0.122 cm (0.048 inch),\nand the Z stiffener thickness O.io16 cm (o.o4o inch). The stiffeners, whose\n\ndimensions are shown in figure 2, were bonded to the face plate using a structural adhesive. The substructure stiffeners consisted of two 93.98 cm long\nchannel frames and two 68.58 cm long Z section stringers framing a 25.4o cm\n(10 inches) by 38.10 cm (15 inches) center bay.\nThe stiffeners introduced some asymmetry into the structure because the\ncross sections of each pair "faced" in the same directional sense, rather than\nbeing oriented symmetrically about lines of midlength and midwidth.\nEXPERIMENTAL TESTS\nThe experimental tests were performed in the facilities of LockheedGeorgia. The panel was supported around the perimeter by a steel frame and\nattached by two rows of machine screws, spaced 8,t 2. 54 cm ( 1 inch) to approximate fixed edge conditions.\nA photograph of the test panel is shown in figure 3, which indicates\nstrain-gage locations and panel attachment points to the test fixture. The\nstrain gages located in the center of the panel had a grid length of 0.9525 cm\n(0.375 inch), the others had a 0.47625 cm (0.1825 inch) grid length. From\nthese strain gages, stresses were determined using the acoustic excitation\narrangement of six speakers as shown in figure 4. The speakers in this system\ncan be phased independently. The modes in this paper were determined by two\nphase conditions shown in the lower part of the figure. All of the modes,\nexcept the 127-Hz mode, were determined using the in-phase arrangement indicated\nin the lower left of the figure. The 127-Hz mode used the configuration in the\nlower right of figure 4. All NASTRAN results corresponded to an in-phase type\nexcitation.\n\nANALYTICAL S0LU1rI0NS\nFinite-Element Solution\nThe special-purpose finite-element program is based on a displacement\nmethod and uses modeling of the stiffness and consistent mass matrices for thinwalJ.ed open section beams. This method involves modification of a rectangular\nplate bending element to include a fundamental interior mode for the element\nas a generalized coordinate. This program, which has not been published, was\ndeveloped by Mr. Fred Rudder of Lockheed-Georgia Company.\nNASTRAN Solution\nNASTRAN modeling of the panel consisted of a simple division of the panel\ninto 5.08 cm (2.0 inch) square elements. In order to accomplish this division,\n1.27 cm (0.5 inch) of the panel perimeter, which has no effect on the experiment\nor analytical response properties, was neglected. The panel was divided into\n\n344\n\n234 CQUAD2 elements with a corresponding 266 grid points as shown in figure 5.\nThe stiffeners were modeled with CBAR elements which were also 5.08 cm long and\nattached to the nearest grid point. The Z stringers were modeled with 13 elements\neach and the channels with 18 elements each. The inertia properties of the Z and\nchannel stiffeners were input for the inertial properties of the CBAR elements. The\nrotational inertia was input as zero and no attempt was made in this model to aline the\nprincipal axis of the CBAR elements with the actual principal axis of the stiffeners.\nTherefore, rotational coupling of the stiffeners was deleted in this model.\nThe panel was oriented in the x-y plane of a rectangular coordinate system\nwith the lower left corner of the plate (grid point 1) as the origin. In order\nto approximate the clamped edge conditions of the panel, all external grid\npoints were fully fixed and all perimeter CQUAD2 elements of figure 5 were\ngiven the properties of steel to simulate the support. The panel was analyzed\nby using the rigid format 3 normal modes analysis. The problem was run with\nthe inverse-power method for solution of the eigenvalues using the standard\ndouble-precision arithmetic, and also using single-precision arithmetic of\nlevel 11.1.2 which shortened the solution times. During some runs, only the\nrotation about the Z axis was constrained for the interior grid points while\nfor other runs the in-plane X and the Y translation components were\nconstrained as well. The inverse-power method was employed using coupled mass\nand generalized mass normalization. Solution times, grid point degrees of\nfreedom, and modal frequencies are listed in Table I. From this table it can\nbe seen that for the same constraints, the decomposition times and total CPU\n(central processor unit) time is much less using singl e-precision arithmetic\nfor the same number of modes. The constraining of three degrees of freedom\ninstead of one had a similar effect on the run times for the same number of\nmodes. This reduction in the number of degrees of freedom resulted in less\nthan a 1-percent change in modal frequency and little change in mode shapes and\nstress ratios. The modes were plotted by using the NASTRAN structure plotting\nroutine in order to determine which modes were of interest for acoustic fatigue\nand response determinations. The quadrilateral and bar elements were plotted\nseparately to allow them to be examined in better perspective. The default view\nangle was used and the time required to generate the plot tape in a restart for\nseven modes and 14 plots was 148 seconds CPU time and a total time of 1081\nseconds (sum of CPU and PPU times). Lockheed reported only four modes from\ntheir experimental work and all of these are compared to NASTRA:N modes which\nwere obtained at comparable mode numbers and shapes.\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS\nA frequency comparison is shown in figure 6 from the three studies used\nfor these four modes. The four mode shapes defined during the experiments are\npresented in figures 7, 9, ll, and 13, as formulated by the NASTRA:N structure\nplotter. Outer fiber bending stresses for CQUAD2 element obtained from NASTRA:N\nare compared with experimentally determined stresses in normalized form in\nfigures 8, 10, 12, and 14. The undeformed locations of the stringer are also\nshown. The stresses were normalized for each mode to the maximum interior\n\nstress within each set of data (experimental set and NASTRAN set). Normal\nstress ratios are plotted corresponding to the strain-gage measurement\ndirections.\nThe first panel mode was found at 63.906 Hz by NASTRAN and is shown in\nfigure 7. This mode is basically that of a single panel in which most of the\ndeflection occurs in the center bay. NASTRAN stress distributions are compared\nwith experimental distributions for the first mode in figure 8, and are seen to\nbe in generally good agreement. Figure 9 shows the second panel mode, and\nfigure 10 the corresponding stress distribution at 81.949 Hz. Agreement between\nthe two methods is not quite as good as for the first mode although the frequencies correspond almost precisely. Two conditions which may account for these\ndifferences may be lack of rotational coupling in the stiffeners and the larger\nsize of the quadrilateral element relative to the strain gage. The third panel\nmode from the NASTRAN analysis is presented in figure 11 at 94.129 Hz. The\nthird experimental mode compared is at 110 Hz, and a comparison of the calcuJated\nwith measured stresses is shown in figure 12 and is noted also to result in poor\nagreement. There is a wide variance in the frequency for this third mode among\nthe three methods used and the reasons for this are probably due, again, to the\nlack of rotational coupling in our model as well as a slight alteration of the\nmodal participation or coupling between panel bays in the experimental case.\nThe first stiffener mode (the fourth panel mode) is so termed because it is the\nlowest frequency mode that has appreciably large motion of the stiffeners. Its\nNASTRAN calculated frequency is 125.539 Hz. The first stiffener mode is shown\nin figure 13 at 125.539 Hz. Panel and bar modal deflections are shown separately in figure 13. The agreement evident in the stresses for this mode are\nshown in figure 14, and was not expected since the experiment was conducted\nusing the out-of-phase acoustic excitation discussed previously and illustrated\nin figure 4. The stringer influence prevented the panel from being excited,\nexperimentally, with the in-phase excitation; but apparently the stiffener\ninfluence improved the data for this case as the in-phase motion of the\nstiffeners has an effect on the panels.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe results presented in this paper are judged satisfactory even though\nthe NASTRAN and experimental results were determined separately witnout\nopportunity for refinement through repeating experiments.\nNASTRAN was found to be a good, but slightly unwieldy, analytical tool for\nevaluating response and stress due to incremental changes in structural design\nof skin-stringer panels. For this type of problem, it was found that computer\nrunning time was reduced significantly by decreasing the number of degrees of\nfreedom per grid point without an appreciable loss in accuracy of the results.\nAlso, the time was further reduced by the use of level 11.1.2, where singleprecision arithmetic is used without noticeable change in the results, if the\nproblem is run on a computer with at least a 60-bit word.\n\n346\n\nTABLE I\nCOMPARATIVE NASTRAN RUN DATA\n\nPreci sion\n\nDegrees\nof freedom per\ninterior\ngrid point\n\nNumber\nof\neigenval ues\n\nTime in\nseconds\nper decomposition\n\nTotal\nCPU\ntime\n( sec )\n\nTotal\ntime\nseconds\n\nBandwidth\n\nSt art\npoi nts\n\nSingle\n\n3\n\n7\n\n19\n\n1928\n\n4787\n\n46\n\n2\n\n10\n\n101\n\n103.85 to\n126.24\n\nSingl e\n\n5\n\n2\n\n50\n\n1132\n\n3212\n\n72\n\n2\n\n3\n\n21\n\n63.90 to\n81.95\n\nSingl e\n\n5\n\n5\n\n50\n\n2188\n\n5688\n\n72\n\n1\n\n6\n\n52\n\n94.12 to\n104.20\n\nDouble\n\n3\n\n1\n\n97\n\n583\n\n1872\n\n46\n\n1\n\n2\n\n12\n\n81.99\n\nNo. of\nt riangul ar\ndecomposition\n\nNo. of\nvector\niterations\n\nFrequency\n(Hz)\n\n~ - - - - 9 3 . 98 cm (37. 0 in. ) _ _ _ _ _\n.,_.I\n27. 90 cm\n(11. 0 in.)\n\n38.10 cm\n(15. 0 in.)\nX\n\n.\n\n,.....,_\n\n8\nu\n\n"SI\'\nLC:)\n\nC\'J\n\n__ _L_\n\nI\n\ns\nu\n\n_ _J\n\n0)\nLC:)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ntC\'J\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n~\n\n..__,,\n\n-\n\nEdge of\n\n7. 68 cm\n(3. 0 in.)\n\ny\n\n1.- Skin- stringer panel overall dimensions.\n\n-\n\ns\nu\n\nco\n\n. .\n\n........

Schmitz\nSperry Rand Corporation\nSpace Support Division\nHuntsville, Alabama\nABSTRACT\nThis paper deals with the application of the NASTRAN program to structural dynamic response of electronic packaging and support structure. The structure modeled and analyzed was the Experiment Support System Assembly (ESS) of the SKYLAB\nOrbital Workshop. The analys is used three rigid formats: Eigenvalue Analys is\n(Format 3), Frequency Response (Format 11) and Static Analysis (Format 1). The\nsame model was used for each analysis using NASTRAN\'s checkpoint/restart/format\nchange capability. Geometry plotting and xy plotting were used to illustrate the mode\nshapes and acceleration response.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper illustrates a technique used to analyze electronic assemblies and\nsupporting structure subjected to random vibration loads using the NASTRAN program,\nReference 1. In addition, NASTRAN\'s Checkpoint/Restart/Format change capability\n(Reference 2) is illustrated and an overview is given to the full analysis.\nThe Experiment Support System (ESS) of the Skylab Orbital Workshop (OWS),\nshown in Figure 1, was used to illustrate the technique. The original analysis was\nperformed for NASA, MSFC Astrionics Laboratory under Contract NASS - 20055 by the\nEngineering Analysis Section, Sperry Rand Space Support Division. The effort was\ninitiated in September 1969 and completed December 1970. During this period various\ndesign concepts were evaluated.

The dynamic loads are\ntransmitted from the OWS floor and ceiling through the side rail and ESS Enclosure\ninto the subassemblies. To analyze the subassemblies in detail it is necessary to\npredict the amplification and/or isolation of the input load resulting from the intermediate structure.\nTo develop working finite element modes which are accurate yet sufficiently small\nto permit efficient use of computer time and analysis techniques within NASTRAN, it\nwas necessary to substructure the ESS. Inspection of the structure reveals three\n"levels" of structures with sufficiently different stiffness that they may be uncoupled\nand modeled independently. They are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSide Rail\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nESS Enclosure\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nElectronic Subassemblies\nFinite Element Models\n\nSide Rail. A NASTRAN finite element model of the Side Rail (ESS enclosure\nsupport structure) was developed to predict the amplification of loads between the\nfloor/ceiling and the ESS Enclosure. The model consists of 69 grid points connected\nby 107 bar and 45 shear panel elements. The stiffness of the ESS Enclosure was modeled as a rigid body using constraint equations to transfer load through the enclosure\n\n366\n\nstructure. The weight of the enclosure was distributed as lumped masses at each\nattach point.\nOmit coordinates were used to obtain a dynamic model containing 66 degrees of\nfreedom (DOF). The analysis set, Kaa\xe2\x80\xa2 inc hides each boundary grid point where the\nESS Enclosure is attached and mass concentrated. The model was used only for\nfrequency response analysis . The checkpoint / restart capability was used, however,\nto obtain a complete set of acceleration responses for the three loading cases (1 g\nin the x, y, and z directions). This model is shown in Figure 4.\nESS Enclosure. A NASTRAN finite element model of the ESS Enclosure, shown\nin Figures 5 thru 7, was developed for static and dynamic analyses. The model consists of 178 grid points connected by 270 bar, 26 triangular plate, and 90 quadrilateral elements. The model resulted in a total structural stiffness matrix, Kgg, with\n1068 DOF which was used for static analysis. This matrix was further reduced to 72\ndynamic DOF for normal mode and frequency response analyses, see Figure 8.\nEach electronic subassembly was modeled as a rigid body using rigid, massless\nbar elements connecting the concentrated mass of the subassembly from its c. g. to\nthe attached points on the ESS Enclosure.\nESS Electronic Subassemblies. The primary power supply (PS) was included in\nthis paper as representative of the other assemblies. It illustrates the prediction of\nthe vibration environment and the calculation of stresses on the lowest "level" structure. A NASTRAN finite element model of the PS, shown in Figure 9, was developed\nfor static and dynamic analyses. The model consists of 154 grid points connected by\n156 plate elements. The model resulted in a total structural stiffness matrix, Kgg,\nwith 924 DOF, which was used for static analysis. The matrix was further reduced to\n39 dynamic DOF for normal mode and frequency response analysis (Figure 9).\nOverview of Analysis\nAn overview of the complete analysis follows:\n1.\n\nA frequency response analysis of the Side Rail structure was performed\nusing lg base excitation, for each of the three axes (three subcases).\nThe results are summarized in Table II.\n\n2.\n\nA normal mode analysis of the ESS Enclosure was performed. Typical\nmode shapes are illustrated in Figures 10 thru 13.\n\n3.\n\nThe response frequencies of the two structures were compared. The\nside rails were found to have a low first resonant frequency ( 44 hertz)\ncompared with the enclosure (245. 5 hertz). The assumption that the\n\nESS Enclosure can be treated as a rigid body supported by a flexible side\nrail structure was confirmed.\n4.\n\nA Restart/Format change was made on the enclosure model from normal\nmode to static. The static equivalent loads (GRAV loads) were calculated using the gains and resonant frequencies calculated for the side\nrail model. Equation (1) was used to calculate these loads; the results\nare also included in Table II.\n\n5.\n\nA Restart/Format change was then made o~ the enclosure model from\nnormal mode to frequency response. The frequency response analysis\nwas performed using lg base excitation for each of the three axes (three\nsubcases). The response for each electronic subassembly is summarized in Table m. A typical acceleration response plot of the PS node\nis contained in Figure 14, for x-axis excitation. The random response\nat each of the electronic subassemblies was calculated in the same computer\nrun. A typical acceleration PSD plot for the PS is shown in Figure 15.\n\n6.\n\nA normal mode analysis of the PS was performed. Typical mode shapes\nare illustrated in Figure 16 thru 18.\n\n7.\n\nThe resonant frequencies of the PS were compared with those of the enc losure. The lowest frequency was found to be 542 hertz, thus confirming\nthe rigid body assumption used in the enclosure model.\n\n8.\n\nA Restart/Format change was made on the PS model from normal mode\nto static. The static equivalent loads (GRAV loads) were calculated\nusing the gains and resonant frequencies calculated from the side rail\nand ESS Enclosure models. Since the resonant frequencies of the power\nsupply were all above the Vehicle Dynamic criteria defined in Table I,\nonly the random criteria is of interest. The resulting static equivalent\nloads are summarized in Tab le IV.\n\n9.\n\nA Restart/Format change was then made on the PS model from normal\nmodes to frequency response. The frequency response analysis was\nperformed using lg base excitation, for each of the three axes (three\nsubcases). The acceleration response and phase for a grid point associated with a critical electronic component is shown in Figure 19.\n\n10.\n\n368\n\nA detailed stress analysis was performed on all structural components\nof the ESS Enclosure and PS using the element forces and stresses\npredicted by the static solutions.\n\nApplication of Special NASTRAN Features\nRigid Body Simulation\nSubstructures which are relatively stiff compared with their supporting structure\nwere modeled as rigid bodies. In the model of the side rail, the ESS Enclosure was\nmodeled using multi-point constraint equations. These equations enforced displacements between attach points. The weight of the enc lo sure was distributed as lumped\nmasses at each attach point.\nThe electronic subassemblies located within the ESS Enclosure were simulated as\nrigid bodies within the enclosure model by lumping the mass of each subassembly at\nits c. g. and then attaching this lumped mass to the enclosure subassembly interface\nusing massless rigid bar elements (stiffness ~ 100 x ESS Enclosure frame stiffness).\nFigure 8 illustrates the finite element model of the Enclosure structure and the bar\nelements used to represent the subassemblies.\nBase Acceleration Excitation\nSince NASTRAN is limited to applied forces in the frequency response format,\nseismic masses (approximately 105 x weight of the structure) are attached at each\nexcited grid point. A force is then applied, equal to the seismic mass, which results\nin a lg sinusoidal acceleration at these grid points. The use of very large masses\nand forces reduces to a negligible amount the feedback to the excited grid points from\nthe resonating structure.\nCheckpoint/Restart/Format Change\nThree rigid formats were used in this analysis, Formats 1, 3, and 11. Unfortunately the use of base excitation precludes using the same geometry and constraint\nbulk data for all three formats. This minimizes the benefit of the Restart/Format\nchange feature of NASTRAN unless care is taken to checkpoint the proper model.\nWhen using base excitation, the normal mode format should be the first format\ncheckpointed. The boundary eondition will be a free-free structure, where the single\npoint constraints are not specified in the case control deck and SUPORT\'s are used\nto remove the rigid body modes. The seis mic masses are included in the model\nduring this checkpoint run. A 11 bulk data cards necessary for the static and frequency\nresponse restarts may be included at this time.\n\nWhen the restart is made for the static analysis the SUPOR T and OMIT cards are\ndeleted from the bulk data and the SPC card added to the case control deck. This will\neffectively ground out all seismic masses used for the frequency response analysis.\nThe GRAV cards are added to the bulk data and LOAD cards to the case control deck.\nThe change from SUP ORT to SPC constraints requires a new decomposition for the\nstatic Restart, however, the reactions may be recovered, and are not available using\nSUPORT constraints. The time lost due to geometry changes in this format restart is\nmore than compensated for in the restart of the frequency response format.\nWhen restarting the frequency response format from the normal mode format,\nno changes are required to the geometry or constraint bulk data. Therefore, the\nproblem will restart at the module DPD and skip over modules SMPl (Guyan reduction)\nand READ (real eigenvalue extraction) saving a significant amount of time, see Figure\n20.\n\nSubsequent restarts of the frequency response format are normally required to\nobtain acceleration and random response plots for multiple subcases. The first frequency response analysis should be checkpointed. Subsequent restarts for new print\nand plot output normally take very little time (typically less than 3 minutes on the\nUnivac 1108).\nA restart of the normal mode analysis is often required to obtain all of the modes\nof interest. In addition, a good check on the accuracy of the model is obtained by\ncalculating the lowest natural frequency of the structure without the use of OMIT cards\nand compare this result with the result obtained using OMIT cards. Changes can then\nbe made, if necessary, to the OMIT set before the time consuming frequency response\nanalysis is performed.\nRandom Analysis\nA unit input acceleration is required for random analysis to satisfy the condition\nthat the output acceleration be equal to the magnification factor, H ( w). The output\nPSD (Sj) then can be solved from the following equation\n\nfor acceleration PSD the units of this equation become,\n(m/sec 2 )2\nhertz\n\n370\n\n= [(m/sec)2]\ng\n\n2\ng2\nhertz\n\nor\n\n(in/sec 2 ) 2\nhertz\n\n= [(in/sec)2]\ng\n\n2\n\ng2\nhertz\n\nRun Time Summary\nA summary of the total run times and significant time spent in specific modules\nare illustrated in Figure 20 for the ESS Enclosure model.\nThe accumulated cpu time (Univac 1108, NASTRAN Level 12. 1. 002 MSFC) is\nplotted as a function of DMAP instruction number, and where large times are accumulated in one module the name of the module is given. Gaps in the curves indicate\nDMAP instructions which were skipped during restart/format change (Formats 1 and\n11).\nBandwidth, DOF and run time comparisons are contained in Table V, for the\nsymmetric decomposition (SDCO), matrix reduction (SMPl) and eigenvalue extraction\n(READ) of the three finite element models discussed in this paper.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n"The NASTRAN Theoretical Manual,\nOctober 1969.\n\n2.\n\n"The NASTRAN User\'s Manual," McCormick, C.

Jones\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe performance of the NASTRAN modal random response\nanalysis, rigid format 11, was inve stigated using a hypothetical stiffened cylindrical shell excited by a simulated\nturbulent boundary layer pressure field. The cylindrical\nshell (2.54 meters in diameter, 3.353 meters in length) was\nsimply supported at both ends. In order to assess the effect\nof the model detail on the results, two models were developed.\nOne model had 360 degrees of freedom and the other 720 degrees\nof freedom. The real part of the forcing function (cospectral density) was represented by an exponentially decaying\ncosine function and the imaginary part of the forcing function\n(quad-spectral density) was represented by an exponentially\ndecaying sine function. Problems associated with NASTRAN\noperations were encountered, but to a large extent, were\nsuccessfully resolved. Only the random response (displacement\nspectral density) obtained for the 360 d.o.f. model is\npresented in this paper. No response data for the complex\nmodel (720 d.o.f.) is presented inasmuch as this portion of\nthe investigation is still in progress.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe analytical prediction of the structural response of\naerospace vehicles to random forces is of key concern to\naerospace engineers. The designer must assess the structural\neffects of the random input forces in an effort to achieve an\nad equate structural design. The task of d e termining analytically the structural response to distributed random forces is\nin general quite involved and time consuming.\n\n393\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to describe the use of\nNASTRAN in determining the dynamic response of a cylindrical\nshell excited by a simulated turbulent boundary layer pressure\nfield. One result of this effort is an assessment of how well\nthe modal random response portion of NASTRAN performs.\nAlthough all dimensions, loads and results are expressed in\nSI units in the paper, the calculations were performed using\nEnglish units.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM\nThe hypothetical structural system used in this\nanalysis was a 2.54 meter diameter, 3.353 meter long shell\nthat was simply supported at both edges. The shell structure\nwas assumed to be constructed of aluminum honeycomb (.0254\nmeter thick core with .002 meter face sheets), together with\nintegral longitudinal an~ circumferential stiffeners (.0254\nmeter square, .002 meter thick wall, aluminum tubing). The\n--longitudinal stiffeners were spaced every 36 degrees around\nthe cylinder and the circumferential ring stiffeners were\naxially spaced .559 meters apart.\nThe random forcing function was selected so as to approximate, at least in form, a turbulent boundary layer loading\nfunction (Ref. 1). For a given pair of grid points u and v,\nthe spectral density (PSD) of the loading function was defined\nas:\n2\nO.

The real part\n(co-spectral density) was represented by a decaying cosine\nfunction and the imaginary part (quad-spectral density) by\na decaying sine function. Note that in matrix formulation\nthe loading function leads to a hermitian spectral density\nmatrix which is required by the physics of the problem.\nThe structural damping constant was assumed to be .02\n(i.e. Q = 50) for this investigation.\n\nNASTRAN ANALYSIS\nThe NASTRAN analysis flow diagram is illustrated in\nFigure 1. The analysis was performed in four steps.\n1.\n\nFinite element models of the shell structure were developed.\n\n2.\n\nModal analyses (rigid format 3) were performed using\nNASTRAN and a restart tape and deck were generated.\n\n3.\n\nA computer program was written to generate a NASTRAN\ninput tape that contained the NASTRAN executive deck,\ncase control deck, and required random input deck.\n\n4.\n\nUsing as input the tapes generated in the previous step\nand the NASTRAN restart tapes from the modal analyses, the\nNASTRAN random response analyses (rigid format 11) were\nperformed. Note that the normal NASTRAN JCL had been\nmodified so as to accept tape input rather than cards.\n\nTwo NASTRAN finite element models (Figure 2 and 3) of\nthe same axisymmetric shell structure were developed in order\nto assess the effect of the model detail on the results. The\nsmall model (model 1) consisted of 70 grid points, 360 degrees\n\n395\n\nof freedom, 100 CBAR structural elements and 60 CQUADl\nstructural elements. The large model (model 2) had 140 grid\npoints, 720 degrees of freedom, 140 CBAR structural elements,\nand 120 CQUADl structural elements. Note that the grid\npattern in model 1 follows the stiffener pattern in the shell,\nand that the model 2 grid pattern has twice the number of\ncircumferential grid points as has model 1. The edge grid\npoints in both mo\'dels were constrained so as to simulate a\nsimply supported condition. Due to the symmetry of the input\nforce field and the structure, the response at 3 grid points\n(2, 3 and 4) for model 1 and at 6 grid points (2, 3, 4, 9, 10\nand 11) for model 2 were sufficient to define the response of\nthe entire structure.\nThe modal analysis (step 2) was accomplished with little\ndifficulty and the results summarized in Table 1. Shell model\n1 was found to have 12 modes in the frequency range of interesr.\n(100 - 300 Hz); however, due to the axisymmetric character of\nthe structure only 7 distinct modes were obtained. Shell\nmodel 2 was found to have 20 modal frequencies and 10 distinct modes in the 100 - 300 Hz band. As can be seen from\nTable 1, there was a considerable difference in the modal\nfrequencies obtained from the analyses of the two models.\nWhile the modes of the complex model (720 d.o.f.) more\naccurately reflect the dynamic properties of the shell;\neither modal set may be used with equal validity in determining NASTRAN\'s ability to calculate random response.\nAn auxiliary Fortran program (step 3) was written by the\nauthor that would:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGenerate the random input loads for all the unconstrained\ngrid points from the basic equation of the loading spectral\ndensity.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGenerate a digital tape having the appropriate case control, executive control and random loading cards necessary\nto execute NASTRAN rigid format 11.\n\nThe requirement for this program was due to the large number\nof random loading cards used as input into NASTRAN. The model\n1 NASTRAN deck contained 1275 random loading cards (RANDPS)\nand the model 2 deck contained 5050 random loading cards.\n\nStep 4 in the analyses, the NASTRAN modal random response\n(rigid format 11), makes use of modal data to derive a dynamic\ntransfer function for a set of input frequencies and then using\nth e input random loads to calculate the structural response at\nthose frequencies.\nWhil e steps l, 2 and 3 were performed with little difficulty, considerable difficulty was encountered in performing\nthe random analyses (step 4). To enumerate the problems with\nNASTRAN in the sequence that they occurred :\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe first computer runs with rigid format 11 were made\nto determine the response of model 1 at 49 frequencies\nusing level 11.1 NASTRAN. The result in all cases was\nan O~O error occurring in the matrix multiplication\nroutine (MPYAD). The OCO, which is an IBM System 360\nerror code , indicates an imprecise interrupt which can\nbe due to a variety of program errors.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLater runs, using level 12.0 NASTRAN to solve the same\nproblem, yielded a B-37 error in the SDR2 module. The\nB-37 which also is an IBM System 360 error code, indicates that not enough peripheral (disk) storage space\nwas available to execute the desired operation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReducing the number of frequencies from 49 to 14 for\nthe model 1 analyses resulted in wrong values of random\nresponse being given by the program. This problem was\ntraced to an error in the "method 2" routine in the\nMPYAD module in NASTRAN. By reducing the number of\nfrequencies to 9 or less, apparently correct answers\nwere obtained inasmuch as this change caused the\n"method l" routine in MPYAD to be used.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the random response of\nmodel 1 was obtained using NASTRAN. The analysis of the\nrandom response of model 2 has encountered problems similar\nto, but more severe than those of model 1.\nTo be specific, for the model 2 analysis , it appears that\na maximum of only 3 frequencies can be input per computer run\nif one is to avoid using the "method 2" routine in the MPYAD\nmodule. At this stage in the investigation, the random\nresponse of model 2 has been obtained for only a few frequencies.\n\n397\n\nPresented in Table 2 are the computer run times for the\nvarious size rigid format 11 analyses. Note that it is most\nefficient from the computer-run-time point of view to input\nas many frequencies as possible per run; however, as long as\nthe "method 2" routine of the MPYAD module gives the wrong\nanswers, the analyst is severely limited in the number of\nfrequencies that can be input in any one computer run.\n\nDISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES\nThe random response (i.e. displacement spectral density)\nof shell model 1 {360 d.o.f.) obtained using NASTRAN is presented in Figure 4. Due to the problems mentioned in a\nprevious section, the analysis of the complex shell model\n(model 2, 720 d.o.f.) has not yet been completed, thus no\ndata for this configuration will be presented even though\nthe output spectra at a few frequencies have been determined.\nNo experimental data or closed form solutions were available to check the results obtained for the shell response,\nhowever, checks with relatively crude hand calculations\nindicated that the NASTRAN calculated response seemed reasonable. With one exception, the responses at the 3 grid points\nwere quite similar. At grid point 4, there apparently was no\nresponse for modes in the frequency range of 258 - 260 Hz.\nThis peculiarity was attributed to the fact that these modes\nhave node points at grid point 4.\nThe effect on the response spectral density of the quadpart of the input loading spectral density was numerically\nassessed by setting this part of the input equal to zero for\none computer run. Comparison of the response spectrum for\nthe zero-quad run and non-zero-quad runs indicates that the\ninput quad spectral density had little effect (""\'1%) on the\noutput displacement spectral density.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nBased upon this \xc2\xb7 investigation, the following conclusions\nwere reached:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe use of NASTRAN to determine structural response to\ndistributed random force fields is practicable, provided\n\nlevel 12.0 NASTRAN is used and the use of "method 2" in\nthe MPYAD module is avoided.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe capability of NASTRAN to analyze large structural\nresponse problems would be considerably enhanced if the\n"method 2" routine in the MPYAD module is debugged.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn effort should be made to determine the feasibility of\nincluding in NASTRAN an automated scheme to generate the\nrequired random input data.

Howlett\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThis paper demonstrates that the NASTRAN computer program can be used to\nanalyze the coupled fluid and structural responses of multibranch pipes as\noccur in aircraft hydraulic systems. The techniques used to model hydraulic\nlines with NASTRAN are explained. Example problems are presented which demonstrate the validity of the analytical model for a simple standpipe system and\nwhich demonstrate that the technique is promising as a basis for detailed\ndynamic analysis of hydraulic systems of actual aircraft.\nINTRODUCTION\nModern high-performance aircraft require increasingly efficient hydraulic\nsystems in order to perform effectively. These hydraulic systems operate at\nmuch higher static pressures than in the past and the piping and other associated equipment is usually designed to obtain minimum weight. These conditions\nof high operating pressures and minimum weight, together with pressure ripples\nand surges introduced by pumps and other items of equipment, produce coupled\nfluid-structural vibrations which must be considered in the design of the\nhydraulic system. Although much work, both experimental and analytical, has\nbeen done on hydraulic systems (for example refs. 1 to 5), previous workers in\nthe field have largely neglected the coupled fluid and structural vibrations .\nSome research has been done in this area (refs. 2 to 4, for example), but\npresent capabilities fall far short of the necessary ability to accurately\npredict coupled responses in practical situations.\nThis paper presents the initial results of a research effort to develop\nanalytical procedures for predicting the coupled fluid-structural responses of\naircraft hydraulic systems. The NASTRAN computer program has been an important\npart of this effort. The bar elements in NASTRAN have been used to develop an\nanalytical model of a piping system filled with fluid. This analytical model\nincludes the coupled interactions between the motion of the fluid and the motion\nof the pipes, as well as the effects of joints where several sections of pipe\nare joined. The flexibility of NASTRAN in allowing the user to specify multipoint constraints is an essential ingredient of the analytical approach. The\npaper presents a structural analogy which is the basis for the analytical model ,\ndescribes the implementation of this analytical model on the NASTRAN computer\nprogram and then concludes with some examples which demonstrate the validity of\nthe approach and indicate how the method can be applied to the analysi s of\nhydraulic systems on realistic aircraft.\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nA\n\ncross-sectional area\n\nB\n\nbulk modulus of fluid\n\nC\n\nspeed of sound in fluid\n\nE\n\nYoung\'s modulus\n\np\n\npressure\n\nu\n\naxial displacement of pipe\naxial displacement of fluid\ndensity\n\np\n\nSubscripts:\n\n1,2,3,4\n\nstations in standpipe configuration\n\nANALYTICAL MODEL\nThe purpose of this section is to explain the techniques used to model\nhydraulic lines with NASTRAN. The analogy between the motion of a column of\nfluid and the longitudinal motion of a bar is developed and the implementation\nof this structural analog on the NASTRAN computer program is described.\nStructural Analogy\nAn idealized section of hydraulic system line is shown in figure 1, where\nsolid lines are used to represent the pipe and dashed lines are used to represent\nthe fluid inside the pipe. The equation of motion satisfied by the column of\nfluid inside the pipe is the classic one-dimensional wave equation\n\n( 1)\n\nwhere\n\ns\n\n=\n\nlongitudinal displacement of fluid\n\nx = longitudinal distance along pipe\nC\n\n=~\n\nB = bulk modulus of fluid\np = fluid density\nEquation (1) is the same equation as that for longitudinal motion of a bar where\nc\n\nis the speed of sound in the bar or\n\n408\n\n--Jf,\n\nE\n\nis Young\'s modulus and\n\np\n\nis the material density of the bar. This structural analogy is used to\nrepresent the fluid inside the pipe. Thus the coupled fluid-pipe system is\nrepresented as a bar within a bar. The fluid bar is considered to have axial\nstiffness only,whereas the pipe is considered to have both axial and bending\nstiffness. For the fluid bar, the value of the bulk modulus B is used in\nplace of Young\'s modulus E and the fluid density p is used in place of the\nmaterial density.\nIn the axial direction, the pipe and the fluid are uncoupled, except for\ncapped ends, bends in the pipe, or points at which two or more different pipes\nare joined. In the lateral direction, the fluid is constrained to move with\nthe pipe so that the mass of the fluid does affect the bending motion of the\npipe.\nFluid pressure is analogous to stress in a bar. The following table\nsummarizes and compares end conditions for some cases of interest.\nTABLE 1.- END CONDITIONS ON FLUIDS AND PIPES\n\nFluid\n\nBar\nIFree end:\n\nstress\n\nClamped end:\n\n=\n\nu = 0\n\ncm\n\n-E dx\n\n= 0\n\nOpen end:\n\npressure\n\n=\n\nB\n\ncs\n\n- dx\n\nCapped end of rigid pipe:\nCapped end of elastic pipe:\n\n= 0\n\ns=\n\n0\n\ns=\n\nu\n\nAt joints in the piping system the structural analogy breaks down to some\nextent,and special equations of constraint must be written to describe the\ncoupling between the various parts of the system. The sections of pipe are\njoined with the standard structural constraints. The fluid in any section of\npipe moves with the pipe laterally as discussed above. The equations of\nconstraint for the fluid are equality of pressures at the joint and the conservation of mass in the joint. If conservation of mass is imposed at the\njoint and the principle of minimum energy is used to obtain the equations of\nmotion, then the equality of pressures emerges as a natural boundary condition.\nThus the equality of pressures at the joint need not be specified as an additional constraint and only the conservation of mass is required. In the present\nanal.ysi~the joint is assumed to be a small section in which the constrained\nfluid at any instant of time is incompressible. This assumption implies that\nthe conservation of mass in the joint becomes conservation of volume. The\nvolume of fluid flowing into the joint must equal the volume of fluid flowing\nout of the joint.\nConsider, for example , the configuration shown in figure 2. Let Ai and\nAr be the cross-sectional area of the fluid in the left and right-hand pipes,\n\nrespectively. Similarly, let uz, sz and ur, sr be the axial displacements\nof the pipe and fluid of the left and right-hand sections at the joint. Assume\nthat u 1 , s z are positive coming into the joint and ur, sr are positive\ngoing out of the joint. The equation for conservation of volume at the joint i s\n\nor\n(2)\nFor the spec ial case of a rigid pipe the motion of the pipe does not enter into\nthe problem and the constraint at the joint which corresponds to equation (2) is\n\n(3)\nEquation (2) is readily generalized for the case where several pipes come\ntogether at a joint.\nNASTRAN Model\nThe analytical representation of the interaction of fluid-pipe motion as\ndescribed previously is accomplished with NASTRAN by using CBAR elements. A\nstraight section of pipe filled with fluid is shown in figure 3, together with\na finite element breakdown and the associated NASTRAN grid points. As indicated\nin figure 3, the same finite element breakdown is used for both the fluid and\nthe pipe. Distinct grid points are used for fluid elements and pipe elements,\nalthough the grid points for the pipe elements are at the same physical locations as the grid points for the fluid elements.\nConsider, first , the NASTRAN representation for the fluid. Each fluid\nelem\nent is represented by a CBAR element , with the bulk modulus of the fluid\nbeing input to the program in plac e of Young\'s modulus and the fluid density\ninput in place of the density of the structural material. In order to give\nthese fluid elements zero bending stiffness, the moments of inertia are input\nas zero. The fluid elements in a straight section of pipe are joined the same\nway as structural elements are joined; that is, a common grid point is used\nat the juncture between elements.\nThe pipe is represented in NASTRAN in the standard way. It is important\nto remember that the grid points for the pipe are distinct from the grid points\nfor the fluid although they have the same physical locations.\nThe fluid and pipe are coupled by using multipoint constraints. Except\nfor the displacement in the axial direction, the fluid grid points are\n410\n\nconstrained to have the same displacements as the pipe grid points. In the\naxial direction, the fluid and pipe are uncoupled, except at capped ends and\njoints. At a capped end, the fluid displacement is equated to the pipe displacement (see Table 1). At each joint, equations of constraint expressing\nthe conservation of volume are imposed (see, for example, equation (2)). It\nshould be noted that this method of modeling joints requires that a distinct\ngrid point must be used for each end of each column of fluid entering the\njoint. In order to simplify bookkeeping, a separate grid point is also used for\nthe end of each pipe entering the joint. Then the following three conditions\nare imposed by the use of the NASTRAN multipoint constraint feature:\n1.\n\nConservation of volume at the joint\n\n2.\n\nEquality of lateral motions of fluid and pipes at the joint\n\n3.\n\nDesired compatibility between the structural elements entering the joint\nAPPLICATIONS\nStandpipe System\n\nTo demonstrate the validity of the approach which has been described, a\nsimple standpipe system was analyzed (fig. 4). The structure is steel pipe\nwith 2.54 cm outside diameter and a wall thickness of 0.305 cm. One end of the\nhorizontal pipe is open; the other end of the horizontal pipe and also the\nupper end of the vertical pipe are capped. The open end of the horizontal pipe\nis clamped and the downstream end is restrained from moving vertically at a\npoint 0.203 m from the capped end. The fluid in the pipe is water and the speed\nof sound in water is taken to be l478 m/s. The system is viewed as six separate\nparts which are joined as previously described. Each of the three fluid\ncolumns and each of the three pipes is represented by lO CBAR elements in\nNASTRAN. The fluid is forced at the open end of the main pipe with a harmonically oscillating pressure of amplitude 6900 N/m2. The system was analyzed\nfirst consideri ng the pipes to be rigid. Frequency response results were\ncomputed using rigid format 8 and the pressure ratios P2/Pl, P3/P1, and p4/pl\nare compared in Table 2 to exact values obtained by using the equations\npresented in reference 4. The NASTRAN values have been faired to obtain the\npressure at the ends of the elements since NASTRAN outputs the average axial\nstress (pressure) in an element. As the table indicates, the agreement is\nquite good.\nPressure distributions throughout the system with rigid pipes, computed at\na frequency of 485 Hz, are shown by the solid curves in figure 5. For convenience, the three sections of pipe are shown separated in the figure . The\nforcing frequency, 485 Hz, is of particular interest because it is the first\norgan pipe frequency of the standpipe. As is well known for the case of a\nrigid structure, the pressure in the main line downstream of the standpipe\nshould be zero at this frequency. As shown by the solid curves in figure 5,\nthis phenomenon is predicted by the present analysis.\n\n411\n\nTABLE 2.- COMPARISON OF PRESSURE RATIOS PREDICTED BY NASTRAN TO THOSE\nPREDICTED BY EXACT THEORY FOR THE CASE OF A STANDPIPE\n\nP2/P1\n\nf, Hz\n\nP4/P1\n\nP3/P1\n\nNASTRAN\n\nExact\n\nNASTRAN\n\nExact\n\nNASTRAN\n\nExact\n\n375\n\n-0.26\n\n-0.26\n\n-0.38\n\n-0.38\n\n-0.76\n\n-0.76\n\n400\n\n-.21\n\n-.21\n\n-.32\n\n-.32\n\n-.77\n\n-.76\n\n450\n\n-. 1\n\n- .1\n\n-.18\n\n-.18\n\n- .9\n\n-.89\n\n485\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1. 16\n\n-1. 16\n\n500\n\n.07\n\n.07\n\n.14\n\n.14\n\n-1.39\n\n- 1 .38\n\n550\n\n1.28\n\n1.27\n\n3.35\n\n3.39\n\n-6.03\n\n-6.04\n\nFigure 5 also shows results for the pressure distribution when the pipes\nare considered to be elastic. The distribution is slightly different than that\nfor a rigid structure, as shown by the dotted curves. For instance, the\npressure in the main line downstream of the standpipe, although relativel y\nsmall, is no longer precisely zero. The overall pressure distributions are not\nmuch different for the two cases. However, there definitely is coupling\nbetween the motion of the fluid and the motion of the structure. The effect of\nthis coupling is shown in figure 6, which presents a plot of the lateral\ndisplacement of the structure along the various lengths of pipe. As indicated\nin the figure, the structure does undergo bending deformation due to axial\nforcing of the fluid at the open end of the pipe. If the frequency of the\nforcing function happened to be near a natural frequency _of the system, the\nstructure would oscillate at large amplitudes. This demonstrates the importance\nof considering the coupled fluid and structural motion of hydraulic systems.\nRealistic Airplane Hydraulic System\nFigure 7 shows a sketch of the pressure distributions predicted by the\nanalysis for a large segment of the hydraulic system on a n actual devel opmental\nfighter a i rpl ane. Although the system was model ed i n three dimensions, the\npiping is shown straightened and flattened out for clarity of presentation. The\nstructure is assumed to be rigid and 277 el ements were used to model the fluid\nin NASTRAN. The sections indicated as filter module (FM) and pressure module\n(PM) were actually rather compl icated compon ents of the hydraulic system but\nwe re modeled as short sections of pipe with diameters much l arger than those\nof the main line. The analytical model includes approximately 14 m of p i pe\nwith a total of six different diameters. The ends of the pipe are assumed to be\ncapped at the positions indicated as direct l ift control (DLC) and high lift\ngear box (HLGB). The forcing function is a harmonically osci llating pressure\nat a frequency of 700 Hz having an amplitude of 6900 N/m2 at the pump outlet.\n\n412\n\nOne limitation of this method is the large size of the problem when the\ncomplete hydraulic system is analyzed. In the present case, for example, only\na rigid structure is considered and the problem has 277 degrees of freedom.\nIf the elasticity of the structure is included, the size of the problem increases\nby about a factor of 6, and the analysis would become expensive. One possible\nmethod of avoiding this difficulty is to consider only part of the structure as\nelastic, although such a procedure has some obvious drawbacks and should be\nused with care. Another technique which could be very useful in solving\ncoupled fluid-structural problems is the use of substructuring. The present\nmethod is well adapted to substructuring because of the small number of\ndegrees of freedom at the joints. Incorporation of substructuring capability\ninto NASTRAN could provide an efficient way to analyze aircraft hydraulic\nsystems.\nThis example does demonstrate the potential of the method for analyzing\nthe effects of pressure ripples on large sections of hydraulic lines of actual\naircraft. As figure 7 shows, at a frequency of 700 Hz the large volume of\nfluid in the filter module significantly attenuates the pressure downstream,\nexcept in the short line leading to the direct lift control. The pressure\nmodule further attenuates the downstream pressure. This attenuation of pressure\nby a large volume of fluid is in qualitative agreement with well-known classical\nresults.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThis paper has demonstrated that the NASTRAN computer program can be used\nto analyze the coupled fluid and structural responses of multibranch pipes\nas occur in aircraft hydraulic systems. The multipoint constraint feature of\nNASTRAN is an important part of the analytical approach. Example problems\nhave been presented which demonstrate the validity of the analytical model for\nthe case of a simple standpipe system and which demonstrate that the technique\nis promising as a basis for detailed dynamic analysis of hydraulic systems of\nactual aircraft. Much work remains to be done, both analytically and experimentally, to develop techniques for using the approach to model parts of\nhydraulic systems other than the lines - such as pumps, manifolds, filters,\nvalves, and structural joints.\nREFERENCES\nl.\n\nDavis, Don D., Jr.; Stokes, George M.; Moore, Dewey; and Stevens, George L.,\nJr.: Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Mufflers With\nComments on Engine-Exhaust Muffler Design.

A. Thornton\nOld Dominion University\nSUMMARY\nA NASTRAN analysis of the normal modes of a 1/15 scale\nspace shuttle dynamics model is described.\nFuselage and wing\ncomponents were analyzed first in a free-free condition and\nthen assembled to give the complete model. The finite element\nidealization employed bar elements, concentrated masses, general\nelements and modeled rigid connections using multipoint equations of constraint. A Guyan reduction was used, and the\neigenvalue problem for the complete model was solved using the\nGivens method.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe determination of the dynamic characteristics of a\nspacecraft structure is always an important step in the development of . the overall spacecraft system. This is particularly\ntrue for the space shuttle since a new concept in space vehicle\ndesign is being used.\nThe space shuttle will be comprised of\na parallel arrangement of the launch vehicle and space vehicle\nduring the launch phase. This arrangement raises the possibility of dynamic effects not previously encountered.\nTo initiate dynamic studies of the space shuttle, Langley\nResearch Center (LRC) designed and procured a 1/ 15 scale model\nof proposed straight wing and delta wing configurations of\nthe shuttle. The vibration characteristics of this model are\nbeing analytically and experimentally investigated.\nDuring an 11 week period at Langley Research Center in the\nsummer of 1970, the author, under the NASA-ASEE Summer Faculty\nFellowship program, was involved in NASTRAN computations to\nestablish pre-test frequencies and mode shapes for the straight\nwing configuration of this model.\nSome of the results of this\nwork and some preliminary experimental results were presented\nat the NASA Space Shuttle Technology Conference held at LRC\nin March, 1971 , (reference 1) .\n\n421\n\nThe present paper describes the NASTRAN analysis of the\nnatural frequencies and mode shapes of the delta wing configuration of this model.\nDESCRIPTION OF MODEL\nThe space shuttle dynamics model is a parallel beam-type\nstructure that is dynamically representative of the stiffness\nand mass properties of an early Manned Spacecraft Center\nconfiguration of the shuttle. The model is shown schematically\nin Figure 1. Scaled simulated propellant masses can be varied\non the booster and orbiter to simulate desired flight times. An\nimportant feature of the model are two elastic interfaces\njoining the booster and orbiter. These were designed with\nremovable spring leafs which permit varying the nominal spring\nconstants in the pitch and yaw planes. Four nominal sets of\nspring leafs were designed.\nThe booster fuselage spar was fabricated from thin walled,\ntapered aluminum cylindrical sections reinforced by internal\nbulkheads.\nThe orbiter fuselage spar is similar except that\nover a major portion of its length the diameter is constant.\nEach fuselage component has foam ballast weight holders used to\nsupport lead weights which simulate the propellant. The orbiter\nfuselage includes a lead nose mass to simulate the payload.\nEach wing has three spars which were designed to give the\nproper bending stiffness distribution for the wing.\nThe wings\nare clamped to the fuselages at three locations through mounting\nbrackets welded to each spar. Outboard of the mounting bracket,\neach spar cross section tap ers linearly from the fuselage to the\nwing tip.\nThe three spars are connected by forward-aft members\nwhich are generally angle bars except at the wing tips where\nflat bars were used.\nNASTRAN IDEALIZATION\nIn this section the NASTRAN idealization of the model will\nbe described first.\nThen two methods of representing the elastic\ninterfaces will be described.\nFinally, a description of the\nmethod of representing the fuselage-wing interfaces will be\ndiscussed.\n\n422\n\nFuselage Components\nThe booster fuselage was idealized by an assembly of ten\nconcentrated masses and nine beam elements. The concentrated\nmasses were represented in NASTRAN using the bulk data card\nCONM2, and the beam elements were represented by CBAR elements.\nThe idealization of the booster fuselage is shown in Figure 2.\nSince the CBAR beam element is uniform, the cross-sectional\nproperties used were average values based on the diameter at\nthe mid-point of each ele~ent.\nAdded weights 2 and 4, (See Figure 1) being distributed\nover relatively short lengths, were represented as concentrated\nmasses at grid points 5 and 8, respectively. Added weights 1\nand 3 were distributed uniformly over elements 2 and 3 and\nmodeled as non-structural mass (NSM).\nConcentrated masses were\nused to model local distributions of mass, such as reinforcing\nbulkheads. The mass moment of inertia Ixx about the roll axis\nof the fuselage was represented by concentrations at each grid\npoint.\nThe orbiter fuselage was idealized in a manner similar to\nthe booster fuselage.\nSeven beam elements and eight concentrated masses were used.\nThe idealization of the orbiter\nfuselage is also shown in Figure 2. The two added weights of\nthis component were distributed over their supporting beam\nelements and modeled as NSM. The payload was modeled as a concentrated mass.\nWing Components\nThe booster delta wing is shown schematically in Figure 3.\nThe wing was idealized using 55 CBAR elements.\nFor the spars\nwhich are tapered the average properties of the elements were\nused.\nThe lower half of the fuselage mounting brackets (not\nshown) which are weld ed to the wing spars wer e represented as\nconcentrated masses.\nThe bending stiffnesses of these\nbrackets were neglected.\nThe orbiter delta wing is shown schematically in Figure 4.\nThe wing was idealized using 29 CBAR elements. As for the\nbooster wing, average values were used for the tapered portions.\nEqual concentrated masses were located at grid points 1-9 to\n\n423\n\nrepresent the fuselage mounting brackets (not shown).\nElastic Interface\nThe elastic interfaces were idealized in two ways.\nIn the\nfirst idealization the interface was represented using simple\nlinear springs with the nominal spring constants in the pitch\nand yaw planes. These were input as bulk data through the use\nof the CELAS2 card.\nIn the second representation of the elastic interfaces the\ngeneral structrual element GENEL was used. The element describes\nthe elastic interface through a six by six flexibility matrix\n[Z] and a six by six rigid body transformation matrix [S], (See\nreferences 2 and 3).\nFor the four nominal cases of the elastic interface stiffnesses, the flexibility matrix [Z] was calculated external to\nNASTRAN making use of a FORTRAN program.\nFor one nominal case\nof the interfaces, experimental data for the flexibility\ncoefficients was used as input to the general element.\nFuselage-Wing Interfaces\nEach fuselage-wing interface was assumed to be rigid.\nThese rigid connections were modeled by writing equations of\nconstraint between the displacement components at the grid\npoints of interest. These equations were written in the form\nof multipoint equations of constraint\n\nwhere Aj are coefficients determined from geometry and Uj are\nthe displacement components. The coefficients of the constraint\nequations were input as bulk data using MPC cards.\nThe wings were attached to the fuselage by assuming a rigid\nconnection between six grid points at the outboard edges of the\nmounting brackets on the wing spars and the nearest grid points\non the fuselage.\nThus the wings were "cantilevered" from the\nfuselage with the cantilever points below and outboard of the\nfuselage centerline.\n\n424\n\nFor the booster fuselage-wing \xc2\xb7 interface grid points 6, 8 ,\n9 on the booster fuselage were connected to grid points 34-39\non the booster wing. A total of 36 equations of constraint\nwere written for the booster fuselage-wing interface. The\norbiter fuselage-wing interface was modeled in a similar way.\nFor this interface, 36 equations of constraint were also written.\nRESULTS\nIn this section the results of the analysis will be presented and discussed beginning first with frequencies and mode\nshapes of each component. Then the results for the elastically\nconnected fuselages will be described.\nFinally the frequencies\nand mode shapes for the complete model will be described.\nComponent Modes\nFuselages\nThe booster fuselage has 60 degrees of freedom (DOF) with\nall displacements permitted; the orbiter has 54 DOF permitting\nall displacements . The consistent mass matrix option was specified, and the eigenvalue problems were solved by the inverse\npower method. The natural frequencies of the booster and orbiter\nfuselages are tabulated in Table I. For comparison, some preliminary experimental data obtained at LRC are also listed.\nTable I\nNatural frequencies of booster and orbiter fuselages.\nBooster fuselage\nMode\n\nfa, Hz\n\nBending\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n36.8\n117.2\n198.7\n\nTorsion\n\n1\n2\n\n114.3\n243.4\n\n1\n\nfe, Hz\n36.3a, 36.8b\n95.2a, 98.8b\n181.9a,177_3b\n\nOrbiter fuselage\nfa, Hz\n\nfe , Hz\n\n240.2\n\nAxial\n\n103 . 5\n229.7\n460.3\n\n103.4a, 102 . 7b\n201b\n205a\nI\n\n88.9\n161. 8\n\naPitch excitation\nbyaw excitation\n\n425\n\nThe e xperimental freq uenci es tend to confirm the predicted\nv alues particularly in the lower modes. The agreement b ecomes\npoorer in the higher modes. Better agreement with the experimental values for the higher modes could possibly be found by\nincluding the rotatory inertia of the added weights and by\nfurther subdivision of the fuselages using more beam elements.\nBecause of the reasonable agreement of the lower modes these\nsteps were not pursued.\nWings\nIn a free-free condition with all grid points having 6 displacement components the booster delta wing has 198 DOF, and\nthe orbite r delta has 162 DOF. To reduce the size of the\neigenvalue problems the lumped mass opti on was selected for\neach wing, and the rotational displacement components were\ndeleted from the eigenvalue problem through the use of the bulk\ndata card OMITl . This reduced the size of the eigenvalue\nproblems for the booster and orbiter wings to 99 and 81 DOF,\nrespectively . Both of these eigenvalue problems were solved\nus i ng the Givens method.\nThe predicted frequencies of the\nfirst ten modes are compared with preliminary experimental data\nin Table II.\nTable II\nFrequencies of free-free booster and orbiter wings.\nBooster wing\nMode\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\nOrbiter wing\n\nfa, Hz\n\nfe , Hz\n\nfa, Hz\n\n24.6\n26.4\n27.3\n28.0\n49.4\n54.4\n65.0\n69.4\n69.6\n96.1\n\n26.4\n24.8\n26.4\n26.0\n\n26.3\n29 . 3\n31 . 0\n61 . 3\n63.2\n67.5\n69.1\n73.4\n\n60 .4\n73.8\n\nfe, Hz\n\n28.5, 32.2\n66.9\n74.5\n100.7\n112.5\n\nThe e xperimental frequencies show reasonable agreement with\nthe predicted values; however, a number of the theoretical modes\nwere not detected in the vibration tests . This may be due to a\nnumber of reasons including the fact t hat some of t he frequencies\n\ntend to be very closely spaced.\nThe NASTRAN structural plotter was used to generate mode\nshape plots for the wing components.\nThe first three modes of\nthe booster wing viewed in this manner are shown in Figure 5.\nIn\nthe plots, each wing is viewed from an aft position at an angle\nof 23\xc2\xb0 above the plane of the wings.\nElastically Connected Fuselages\nThe frequencies of the elastically connected fuselages were\nfirst calculated with scalar springs with axial and roll displacements prohibited. A consistent mass matrix was selected, and\nthe inverse power method was used t o solve the eigenvalue\nproblem. Frequencies for the elastically connected fuselages\nwere also calculated using the general element to represent each\nelastic interface by its theoretical flexibility matrix.\nThe\nlumped mass approach was taken and rotational components of displacement in the XZ and YZ planes were omitted. Each grid point\nwas thus permitted to have all three translational components\nof displacement and a rotational component of displacement about\nthe X axis. The resulting eigenvalue problem involved 72 DOF\nand was solved by the Givens method.\nThe frequencies were also\ncalculated with this approach using the experimentally determined\nflexibility matrix. These results are compared with the frequencies for the nominal spring constants and the theoretical flexibility matrix in Table III. Experimental frequencies are also\ngiven for comparison.\nAs Table III indicates, the scalar spring idealization of\nthe interface predicts the frequencies of the pitch and yaw\nmodes to be identical. The pitch frequencies for the first\nfour modes were predicted fairly well, but the yaw modes and\nthe combined pitch-axial modes were poorly predicted. The\nagreement between the frequencies predicted by the flexibility\nmatrix representations of the interface and the experimental\nfrequencies is generally good.\nThe only significant error\noccurs for the combined pitch-axial mode. The reas on for the\nlarge difference for this mode is not known.\nComplete Model\nThe final representation of the complete model was obtained\nby joining the wings to the fuselages with the equations of\nconstraint. With 6 DOF permitted at all grid points the complete model possessed 432 DOF after the multipoint constraints\nwere imposed.

All rotational coordinates on the wings\nwere omitted as well as rotations in the XZ and YZ planes on\nthe fuselage except at wing attachment points. Roll rotations\nwere permitted on both fuselages.\nThe Givens method was used\nto solve the final matrix eigenvalue problem with 246 DOF.\nThe\ntotal computational time (CPU) on an LRC CDC 6600 computer was\n2924 seconds to calculate all eigenvalues and twenty-five eigenvectors.\nFor the elastic interface considered, there were forty modes\npredicted with frequencies less than 200 Hz. Of the first thirtytwo modes, eight modes involved coupled motions between the\nfuselages, and twenty-four modes involved uncoupled wing vibrations. Computer plots of the mode shapes were used to classify\nthe modes according to their predominant motion. The plotter\nview of the undeformed model is shown in Figure 6. Since the\nwings were attached to the fuselages by constraint equations, no\nelement connections are shown between the fuselages and wings\nin Figure 6b. The general element representation of the interfaces is also not shown by the plotter.\nTwo typical modes are\nshown in Figure 7.\nCorrelations with experimental data are currently being\nmade at LRC. NASTRAN predicted the first mode experimental\nfrequency of 10.9 Hz correctly; however, a comparison of the mode\nshapes for the higher modes will be necessary before any definite\nconclusions can be reached.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nA NASTRAN normal mode analysis of a space shuttle dynamics\nmodel has been made proceeding from free-free component analyses to an analysis of the complete model. Agreement with\nexperimental vibration results was generally good for the\ncomponents.\nCorrelation with the test data for the complete\nmodel has not yet been completed but the lower modes appear\nto be in agreement.\nThe results of the study showed NASTRAN to be an effective\nanalysis method for the model.\nComputational times generally\ntended to be long on the LRC CDC 6600 computer. The program,\nhowever, was relatively convenient to use because of its\nthorough documentation. The structural plotter was particularly\neasy to program and proved to be a valuable asset in obtaining\na visual representation of the comparatively complex modes of\nthe model.\n\n429\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nLeadbetter, S.

Marshall Space Flight Center\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1970, NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center initiated a study to determine the possibility of spinning the Skylab (this nation\'s first manned orbiting space station). The purpose of the spin would be to provide an artificial\ngravity environment to assess and compare the physiological and mental ramifications of prolonged zero-gravity and artificial-gravity environments. Several\nstudy teams were formed at the Marshall Space Flight Center. The co-authors of\nthis paper comprise a portion of one of the study teams that have been designated\nto conduct this study until conclusive results have been obtained. It is anticipated that the results of the study would be appropriate not only for Skylab\nbut also for analysis of future spacecraft, particularly those that are combined\nof several connected bodies with attached flexible appendages (such as Skylab).\nIn spinning the Skylab, it would be necessary to spin the vehicle about\na principal axis of intermediate moment of inertia in order to keep the solar\npanels pointed nominally toward the sun. Since it was hoped that passive\nstability could be achieved , it became necessary to consider deploying masses\neither on cables or extendable booms so that the principal axis of maximum\nmoment of inertia could point in the same direction as the normal to solar\npanels.\nTo study the stability of motion of a spinning Skylab, the method of\nhybrid coordinates developed by Dr. P. W. Likins (ref. 1) of the University\nAcknowledgment: The assistance and advice of Mr. D. W.

F 9 and Ts are the sum of the external\nand connection force and torque vectors, respectively. H8 is the angular momentum vector and i denotes differentiation in the inertial frame of reference.\nFor a rigid body of an appendage spinning nominally in the steady state\nwith an angular velocity ~ (fig. 1), the expression for acceleration is written as\nbd2\nAs = -:-2 (c +\nW X (~ X (\xc2\xa3. + :!:!_s ) ) + ~ X (~ X !:s )\ndt\n+\n\ni\n\nd w x (_c + u\n\ndt -\n\ns\n\n+ r8\n\n-\n\ni\n\n+ ~ R\n\n)\n\n(2)\n\ndt -\n\nTs = id (Is \xe2\x80\xa2ws) = id (Is \xe2\x80\xa2(W +\ndt - dt id\nbd2\n= Is \xe2\x80\xa2 [-- W +-- Rs + W\n.\ndt - dt2 ~\n+\n\nw\n\nX\n\nl \xc2\xb7~ +\n\nw\n\nX\n\nl8.\n\nbd\ndt\n\nX -\n\n:i t\n\nAS]\n\n~\n\n+ bd\n\nJi\'S\'\n\nX\n\nIs \xe2\x80\xa2 w\n\n(3)\n\ndt\n\nwhere\xc2\xa3. is a vector representing the location of the mass center at time \'t\'\nwith respect to its steady state position. :!:!.s and Ji6 are vectors representing\nthe displacement and small rotation, respectively, of the sth rigid body from\nits steady state configuration. !..s is a vector representing the location of\nthe sth rigid body of the appendage in its steady state configuration measured\nfrom the steady state mass center location. rs is the inertia diadic of the\ns th rigid body.

(2), which is\ndue to coriolis acceleration, gives rise to a skew-symmetric matrix; whereas,\nthe third term, which is due to the centripetal acceleration, yields a symmetric\nmatrix. The fourth term represents a steady state centripetal acceleration\nwhich describes the steady state configuration and stretching forces which, in\nturn, gives rise to the second order geometric stiffness matrix. In the absence\nof angular acceleration, the fifth term vanishes. If rotational dynamics are\nthe primary concern, the effect of translation of the orbit is disregarded and\nthe last term also vanishes. The fourth term on the right hand side of eq. (3)\nrepresents the steady state rotation, and the last two terms will cancel each\nother if the inertia matrix is diagonal with all the terms having the same\nmagnitude.\nConservation of linear momentum provides the relation\nc = -\n\nl\n\ni:\n\nM s=l\n\n(4)\n\nms us\n\nwhere Mis the cumulative mass of all appendages and the central rigid body, and\npis the total number of masses representing all of the appendages.\nThe set of equations of motion of all of the rigid bodies representing the\nappendages is obtained by substituting eq.

(8) is being used because it has the advantage of requiring less\ncomputer storage core than eq. (5) and because it uses a NASTRAN generated mass\nmatrix. However, this approach has the disadvantage that the matrix [Ke+ Kg]\n[T]-1 is non-synnnetric. The eigenvectors of eq. (8) are obtained and transformed\nby eq. (7) to yield the eigenvectors of eq. (5).\nSince it is not possible to uncouple either the set of eq. (5) or the set\nof eq. (8), they are reduced to the state space formulation in several steps.\nThis leads to the uncoupled set of eq. (10) which are amenable to truncation.\nThe first step is to write the state space equation,\nAq + Bq = L\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nA =\n\n[:\'\nI\n\n:,J\nII\n\nK =K\n\nB =\n\n[_::\n\n:].\n\nL =\n\n{:}\n\n[q} = lu}\nu\n\n+ Ke + Kg,\n\nThe eigenvectors of eq.

To obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, eq. (8) are programmed. However, with only a minor change in TIMAP instruction, eq. (5) can\nbe programmed as an alternate approach.\nExample\nThe eigenvalue problem associated with solar panels attached to the Skylab\nApollo Telescope Mount and Orbital Workshop is idealized into a 102 degrees-offreedom system and solved. So that the results can be more easily studied,\neigenvalues of an L-beam with six-lumped masses and 36 degrees-of-freedom shown\nin fig. 2 are illustrated here.\nThe results are tabulaDed in Table No. 1. Also, to show the effect of\nretaining the geometric stiffness matrix, two cases for each spin rate are\nshown. The results show that it is important to retain the geometric stiffness\nmatrix. The lowest natural frequency corresponds to the vibrations of the\nmasses in the plane of rotation. It is this frequency which is substantially\naffected by, the spin rate, even with \xc2\xb7a relatively slow spin rate which is less\nthan the fundamental natural frequency. The second natural frequency corresponds\nto the vibrations in the vertical plane. The last column shows the case where\nthe spin velocity is higher than the first two natural frequencies.\nCONCLUSION\nThe effect of rotation on the structural and dynamical behavior of a\nspinning body with flexible appendages can be significant, as shown by example.\nTo adequately include this effect in a digital simulation requires a complex\neigenvalue solution to a fairly high order system. The feasibility of such an\napproach is indicated in the papeT.\n\n445\n\nREFERENCE\n1. Likins, P.

Giles\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nJohn H, Dutton\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri\nSUMMARY\nAn analytical study of a space shuttle orbiter structure is being made\nat NASA Langley Research Center using NASTRAN as the analysis program, The\nanalysis starts with a finite element model with over 3000 joint degrees of\nfreedom, which was developed by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation (St. Louis)\nduring its Phase B studies of the orbiter. The model has structural members\nsized using the fully stressed design procedure in the Automated Structural\nDesign (ASD) program. To date, conversion to the NASTRAN format of the\ntopological ASD input data for the complete vehicle and conversion of eight\nwing loading conditions has been completed, In addition, a structural\nanalysis of the orbiter wing has been completed, The effort required to\nconvert the data is discussed, and basic differences in the two finite element\nprograms are described. Also, the performances of the NASTRAN and ASD\nprograms are compared in terms of calculated quantities such as stresses and\ndisplacements, and in computational times required for a single analysis cycle\nof the orbiter wing structure,\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCalculations for an entire shuttle orbiter under a variety of loading\nconditions are being made at the Langley Research Center on the Langley CDC\n6600 computer system using the NASTRAN program (ref. 1) as the analysis tool.\nThe calculations are b eing made to gain experience in the analysis of a large\ncomplex structure with realistic loading conditions. The particular structure\nwas chosen for analysis because it has previously been analyzed by the\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation and its finite element model was available.\n\nThe finite element model, which had over 3000 joint degrees of freedom, was\ndeveloped during Phase B studies of the orbiter. A fully stressed design of\nthis model was obtained by McDonnell Douglas using the Automated Structural\nDesign (ASD) program described in reference 2. Their calculations were made\non an IBM 360/85 computer system. The purpose of the present paper is to\nreport on the initial phase of the study and to discuss results obtained\nto date.\nDESCRIPTION OF FINITE ELEMENT MODEL\nPrincipal structural components of the space shuttle orbiter considered\nin this study are shown schematically in figure 1. The finite element\nstructural model (fig. 2) of this vehicle was developed by the McDonnell\nDouglas Corporation. The model is symmetrical about the centerline of the\nvehicle so it was necessary to represent only half of the model in the\nanalysis. The half-model contains 1388 joints and 3154 joint degrees of\nfreedom. Rods, bars, and shear panels are the finite elements used to\nrepresent the structural members. A total of 2636 rods, 27 bars, and 1355\nshear panels are included in the model. Approximately five man-months were\nneeded to generate the topological definition of the model (i.e., joint\nlocations and specification of finite elements connecting the joints).\nAlternate structural arrangements were tried until proper load paths were\nestablished during this period of time. Sizes of the elements were then\ndetermined using the fully stressed design procedure in the ASD program.\nThe model consists of eight discrete modules which are assembled into a\nsingle structure (fig. 3). The eight modules are: (1) main wing box, (2)\nforward wing, (3) nose, (4) main propellant tanks, (5) crew compartment, (6)\nupper fuselage, (7) aft fuselage, and (8) vertical tail. This method of\ndefining the structure permits the assignment of a particular module to the\ngroup responsible for its design.\nAlthough the data are prepared in many smaller sets, the assembled\nstructure is analyzed by the ASD program in a single computer run, as is done\nin the 12.1 version of NASTRAN. Thus, substructuring was not used in the\nanalysis and the use of modules merely provided a convenient method of bookkeeping for the voluminous quantities of input and output data generated in\nthe analysis of a large structure. However, the complete model can be\ndivided into several modules which can be analyzed alone, replaced by modified\nor alternative configurations, or changed to improve detailed definition in\nan area of particular interest, without affecting the overall model.\nConversion of the topological ASD inout data to the NASTRAN format produced a bulk data deck containing 19,143 cards. In addition, eight load\nconditions which act only on the wing (modules 1 and 2, fig. 3) have also\nbeen converted. However, input data for five external loading conditions\n(concentrated forces and pressures) and two thermal condi t ions for the\ncomplete vehicle have not yet been converted.\n\nCOMPARISON OF ASD AND NASTRAN PROGRAM FEATURES\nAny comparison of two computer programs is generally rather nebulous.\nThe original purpose of the programs, types of analyses they will perform,\ntypes of finite elements available, maximum size of problem, computer systems\non which the programs are operational, ease of use, etc., can vary widely and\ncan have a significant impact on the quantity that is being compared, usually\ncomputational time for a given problem. Since NASTRAN is a widely used\ngeneral purpose structural analysis program and its features are well known\nand documented, it is inevitable that it will be compared with other programs.\nThe comparisons presented in this paper will tend to emphasize the desirable\nfeatures of the ASD program with the thought that such comparisons might\nprovide guidance in the continuing future development of the NASTRAN program.\nIncorporation of such features must, of course, be weighed against compromising the original purpose of the NASTRAN program.\nThe Automated Structural Design (ASD) program uses a "combined" method\nof analysis rather than either of the traditional force or displacement\nmethods; NASTRAN uses the displacement method. In the combined method, all\nof the equilibrium and compatibility equations are combined into a single set\nof simultaneous equations which are solved in a single operation for all\nforces or stresses and displacements. The apparent disadvantage of solving\nthe resulting large set of equations (twice the order of the force or displacement method) has been resolved by the development of an efficient\nbookkeeping system which handles only the non-zero elements of the matrix\nduring the analysis. This procedure is not affected appreciably by the\n"band-width" of the matrix, a very desirable feature that makes the modular\narrangement of the structural model feasible. Some penalty in computational\ntime will be involved when using NASTRAN to analyze the model in this study\nbecause running time of version 12.1 of NASTRAN is band-width dependent.\nNASTRAN was designed to be open-ended in the size of problem it can\nhandle; ASD can accommodate large problems also, the only limitation being a\nmaximum of 65,535 degrees of freedom for the structure. Thus, either program\ncan handle the size problems being run currently in industry.\nThe version of the ASD program described in reference 2 is limited to\nstatic analysis but also includes a fully-stressed element resizing procedure.\nIterations of analysis and resizing can be made until the desired tolerance\non member sizes from consecutive iterations is obtained. The capability for\nmember resizing is a desirable feature for a finite element program,\nparticularly for use in preliminary design. A recommendation that this feature\nbe incorporated into the NASTRAN program cannot be made at this time, however,\nsince it is not clear whether improved versions of NASTRAN will be economically\ncompetitive with existing programs in such design applications (refs. 2 to 4).\n\nRods, bars, and shear panels are the only finite elements available in\nASD and were thus the elements used to define the -model considered in the\npresent study. The ASD rod and bar member s can be either single-segment as\nin NASTRAN or double-segment. The double-segment member has a node at the\ncenter and can have different cross-sectional areas for the two segments.\nEither all single-segment or all double-segment rods and bars can be used in\na given structure, but not both types. The shear panels must correspond to\nthe types of rod and bar members in a given structure. When shear panels are\nused with a double-segment member a connection is made to the rods or bars\nat the center of each side of the panel.\nThe orbiter structure (fig. 2) was modeled with double-segment members,\nand since NASTRAN does not contain such finite elements, the areas of the two\ns egments in a member were averaged and converted to a rod or bar element of\nconstant area along its length. Hence, the finite element representation of\nthe structure as analyzed by ASD is not the same as the one analyzed by\nNASTRAN. This modeling difference will affect the numerical results obtained\nin this study.\nIt is often desirable to isolate portions of a complex finite element\nstructural idealization in order to examine these smaller segments in greater\ndetail. Plots or printed output can be assessed for the selected portion of\nthe structure without being confused with the remainder of the s tructure.\nThis can be done in NASTRAN by specifying a SET of grid points and/or elements\nthat define that portion of the model to be considered. The ASD program has\na similar capability and in addition allows the user to specify sectioning\nplanes which cut through and isolate portions of a structure to be plotted.\nFor example, sectioning planes could be defined on each side of a fuselage\nframe so that a plot of the single frame would result. Incorporation of ~his\ncapability into NASTRAN, with an option to generate internally SET definit ions\nfrom sectioning plane specifications, would greatly reduce the burden on the\nanalyst of preparing SET cards.\nCONVERSION OF ASD INPUT DATA\nTO NASTRAN FORMAT\nIn the present study, computer routines were written to convert the ASD\ninr, 1t data to the NASTRAN format. In this section of the paper, some of the\ndifficulties encountered with the conversion are indicated, and procedures\nto circumvent these difficulties are described.\n1\n\nIn the ASD data, the grid points or joints in each individual module of\nthe structure are numbered sequentially s tarting with the number 1. Direct\nconversion of grid points would have resulted in more than one grid point with\nthe s ame number. Since NASTRAN does not require sequential grid numbering, it\nwas possible to convert the points to unique numbers by using the scheme\n(NASTRAN grid number)= (ASD module number) x 100,000 + ASD grid number,\n\nA similar procedure was used for the element connection, element property,\nand material type identification numbers. Such a numbering procedure is\nuseful in general finite element analyses as an aid in bookkeeping of large\namounts of data.\nThe wing modules (1) and (2) were defined in a different coordinate\nsystem than the other modules. All modules were assigned a different\ncoordinate system number and the modules were made compatible using the NASTRAN\nbulk data card CORDlR. A similar method of defining various parts of the same\nstructure in different coordinate systems is included in the ASD program and\nwas used to produce the module definition plot shown in figure 3. The eight\nmodules are automatically connected by the ASD program; multipoint constraints\n(MPC bulk data cards) were used to connect the modules for the NASTRAN input\ndeck.\nThe principal difficulty encountered during the conversion of the data\nwas that of incorporating structural constraints which are internally determined by the ASD program. The ASD program assigns degrees of freedom to each\ngrid point after investigating the geometry of the rod and bar elements at the\ngrid point. If all rod and bar members intersecting at a grid point lie in a\nplane, constraints prohibiting displacement of that grid point out of the\nplane are automatically generated. These constraints, which remove singular ities in the stiffness matrix, must be supplied as input data to the NASTRAN\nprogram since it does not automatically provide any constraints of this type.\nTo generate these constraints, procedures were incorporated in the conversion\nroutines which (1) determined all the rods or bars connected at each grid\npoint, (2) calculated the volume of the largest parallelepiped that would be\nconstructed between unit vectors colinear with any three members at the\njoint, and (3) if the volume was less than a small specified value (zero\nvolume would indicate all members were exactly in the same plane) generated a\nmult ipoint constraint which would restrict displacement out of that plane.\nThe relatively large number (19,143) of cards generated by the conversion\nof data were put on a NASTRAN users master file (U.MF) to minimize the handling\nof such a large bulk data deck. Since the modules were converted one at a\ntime, poor ordering of the cards resulted and, hence, a computer time of 20\ncentral processor (CPU) minutes and 50 peripheral processor (PPU) minutes on\na CDC 6600 were required to generate the U.MF. Experience using the U.MF with\nthis data, which was grouped in modules , indicated the desirability of being\nable to call and execute bulk data from several problem decks assigned to\nthe same or different users master files. This would allow division of a\nlarge data deck into smaller decks, thus facilitating bookkeeping procedures.\nAlso, a bulk data printout could be requested using ECHO selected portions of\nthe data, rather than the complete deck with the corresponding large amount\nof printed output.\n\n455\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\nA NASTRAN analysis of the entire orbiter had not been made at the time\nof the preparation of this paper since all external loading conditions have\nnot been converted to the NASTRAN format. A structural analysis has been\nmade by McDonnell Douglas using the ASD program for eight design conditions\nconsidering both symmetrical and antisymmetrical loads applied to half the\nstructure having the appropriate boundary conditions. The results were combined to obtain the asymmetrical behavior of the complete vehicle. The\ncomputer time required for an analysis-resize-analysis cycle was 21.6 CPU\nminutes and 80.6 PPU minutes. A NASTRAN analysis for the same conditions\nwill be performed during a later phase of the study to obtain comparative\ncomputational time.\nAn analysis of the wing has been completed using both ASD and NASTRAN.\nThe finite el ement model contained 255 grid points and 759 degrees of freedom.\nThe wing was supported along the root rib of the 3-bay main wing box (module\n1) and at the intersection of the leading edge spar and the root rib of the\nforward wing section (module 2). The loadings considered in the analysis\ncorresponded to a 2.5g subsonic pullup maneuver, vertical ascent max aq\nloading, engine thrust, main gear landing, main gear braking, turning,\ntaxiing, and hoisting. These eight load cases were applied to the wing and\ndeflections and internal stresses were determined.\n\nThe normal displacements obtained with ASD and NASTRAN for the orbiter\nwing along the rear spar and tip rib are compared in figures 4 and 5 for the\n2.5g subsonic pullup maneuver, The solid curves correspond to ASD results\nand the symbols to NASTRAN results. Excellent agreement between results is\nobtained even with the differences in modeling mentioned earlier in the discussion of the differences between the ASD and NASTRAN programs. Note that\nthe scale in figure 5 has been exaggerated for clarity. The maximum difference found between displacement values obtained by these two programs was\n2 percent.\nSpar cap axial stresses on the upper surface at the wing root are shown\nin figure 6 for the 2.5g subsonic pullup case. The ASD rod and bar elements\nare connected at their midpoints to the adjacent shear panels. Thus, the\nstresses in the two segments of a rod can have different values. These two\nvalues were averaged to compare the stress data with the NASTRAN stresses,\nwhich are constant along the length of the rod or bar. The agreement is poor\nfor some of the spars. These spars are probably in regions where considerable\nstress redistribution is occurring, and a significant amount of load is being\ntransferred at the midpoint connections of the rod and shear panels. A more\nrealistic comparison would be obtained if the total load being transferred\nacross a particular section of the models were calculated; it i s anticipated\nthat such results would be in considerably better agreement.\n\nThe ASD program required appr oximately 0.8 minut es of CPU and 2.0\nminutes of PPU time on an IBM 360/85 computer for a single analysis with all\neight loading conditions, while N\nASTRAN used 9.4 minutes CPU and 13.7 PPU\ntime on a CDC 6600 computer.\nSince the model was generated for the ASD program, which is band-width\nindependent, some penalty of computational time is undoubtedly encountered\nin the NASTRAN computation over what would be required if a numbering scheme\nwhich gives minimum band-width had been used . However, even with this factor\naccounted for, it is expected that the ASD program, which has been tailored\nfor efficient use during preliminary design, would still be significantly\nfaster than the NASTRAN program for solution of this problem.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe NASTRAN program is being used to analyze a space shuttle orbiter\nfinite element model which was developed by the M\ncDonnell Douglas Corporation.\nUser experience and numerical results obtained during the initial phase of\nthis study were described. The structural members of the model were sized by\nM\ncDonnell Douglas using the fully stressed design procedure in the Automated\nStructural Design (ASD) program. The effort required to convert the input\ndata for the ASD program to the format required for the NASTRAN program was\ndiscussed, basic differences i n the two finite element programs were described,\nand desirable features of each program were indicated.\nStresses and displacements from an analysis of the orbiter wing structure\nwere obtained for eight loading conditions. Result s for one l oading condition\nwere compared with ASD result s at selected l ocations on the wing. Excellent\nagreement was obtained between wing displacements calculated with the NASTRAN\nprogram and with the ASD program; agreement between wing root spar cap\nstresses obtained from the two programs was not a s good, but the difference\ncan b e attributed to the use of double-segment finite elements in the ASD\nanalysis, which are not available in NASTRAN. The computational time required\nfor the NASTRAN anal ysis of the wing structure using a CDC 6600 computing\nsystem was mor e than a factor of 10 greater than that required by the ASD\nprogram on an IBM 360/85 computing sy s tem.\n\n457\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nButler, Thomas G.; and M\nichel, Douglas: NASTRAN, A Summary of the\nFunctions and Capabilities of the NASA Structural Analysis Computer\nSystem.

Loendorf**\nABSTRACT\nThe use of NASTRAN as the analysis tool in a structural design process\nis described. A section of an aircraft fuselage type structure with rings,\nstringers and skin idealized by 408 finite elements and 858 degress of freedom\nwas optimized in an analysis - evaluation - redesign closed cycle.\nNASTRAN was employed in the "analysis step", with the "evaluation" and\n"redesign" steps supported by separate programs, and data transfer was\ncarried out by hand. This procedure proved to be workable with turn-around\ntime for one redesign cycle requiring one day. Approximately five redesign\ncycles were needed to converge to an optimized design.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe success of any structural design procedure hinges upon the efficiency\nof the analysis tool used for the repetitive computation of stresses and deflections following each structural modification. Many standard computer\nprograms exist for structural synthesis, yet they are often not readily available to engineers who may need to occasionally perform structural optimization.\nFurthermore, substantial time is often required to learn to use them efficiently. For some users, NASTRAN may be the only comprehensive structural analysis\ntool available to be used in a design process. A procedure found useful in\nsuch cases is reported in the present paper wherein NASTRAN has been used in\na structural design mode supported by a small programmable desk top calculator.\n\n*\n**\n\nAerospace Engineer, NASA, Langley Research Center\nAerospace Engineer, Langley Directorate, U.S. Army Air Mobility\nR & D Laboratory.\n\n465\n\nAUTOMATED DESIGN PROCEDURE\nBasic Objective\nThe subject of the design is a cantilevered cylindrical shell simulating\nthe aft section of an aircraft fuselage. The shell shown in Fig. 1 is stiffened\nby rings, stringers and floor members and carries a load uniformly distributed\nalong the floor to approximate a cargo load in a_ pull-up maneuver.\nThe objective of the design process is to reduce the weight of the shell\nby repeated application of the fully stressed design (FSD) procedure to stringers\nand skin panels in presence of reinforcing rings of different in-plane bending\nstiffnesses. Considering ring bending stiffness as a variable parameter an\ninvestigation of the following phenomena was carried out:\n-influence of the ring bending stiffness on the bending stress distribution\nacross the fuselage section.\n-influence of the ring bending stiffness on the behavior of FSD as an\niterative method.\n-distribution of the stringer cross-sectional areas and panel thicknesses\ngenerated by FSD for different ring stiffnesses.\n-relationship between the minimum weight resulting from FSD and the ring\nbend i ng stiffness .\nComputational Procedure\nThe design procedure consisted of an initialization and the arrangement of\nthe following three steps in a repetitive sequence:\n1.\n\nthe use of NASTRAN for stress and deflection analysis\n\n2.\n\nthe use of a FSD method to correct stringer areas and skin thicknesses\n\n3.\n\nthe use of a ring sizing program to select the lightest possible ring\nsection for a given moment of inertia, and internal forces.\n\nAn initial design consisting of assumed cross-sectional areas for stringers,\ncross-sectional areas and moments of inertia for rings and thicknesses for skin\nwas chosen and the information flow proceeded as shown in Figure 2.\nInput for NASTRAN was generated automatically, using a specially written\nprogram (block 2, Fig. 2), and placed on tape for subsequent reading by NASTRAN.\nNASTRAN (block 3, Fig. 2) analysis was performed using a finite-element model\nof the fuselage as shown in Figure 3. The stringers were modeled by ROD\nelements(tension/compression), the rings were idealized as polygonal frameworks\n\n466\n\nusing CBAR elements (tension/compression and bendipg) and the skin was approximated by the CQDMEM elements (membrane state of stress)*. To insure that a\nreasonable mesh size was used around the circumference, convergency experiments\nwere carried out by varying the angle a (Fig. 3) from 30\xc2\xb0 to 15\xc2\xb0 to 7.5\xc2\xb0. An\na= 30\xc2\xb0 was chosen as a compromise between the desire to keep NASTRAN execution\ntime at a minimum yet retain accuracy requirements. Therefore the fuselage\nmodel used contained 156 RODS, 132 BARS and 120 CQDM\nEMS with 858 unknown degrees\nof freedom. In view of symmetry of the load and structure, the above figures\nwere reduced approximately one-half in the actual computation.\nThe FSD method (block 4, Fig. 2) used to design the ROD and CQDMEM elements\nwas as follows:\nnew stringer\ncross-section\n\nold stringer\n\n=\n\ncross section\n\narea\n\nX\n\nold thickness\n\nallowable stress\n\narea\n\nnew thickness\n\nstress in old stringer\n\nof a membrane\nplate\n\n=\n\nof a membrane\nplate\n\nequivalent stress\n\nX\n\nin old plate\nallowable stress\n\nThe equivalent stress in CQDMEM elements was computed according to the Hubervon Mises formula. Ring spacing was selected, based on Shanley\'s criterion\n(ref, 2). The ring cross-sections were assumed to be of the channel type,\nconstant in circumferential direction. They were dimensioned by the ring sizing\nprogram (block 5, Fig. 2) which performed a constrained minimization (ref. 3)\nof the ring cross-section area in a way so as to make its moment of inertia\nequal to the given value while accounting for: buckling of the free flange,\nyielding, minimum gage for thickness and minimum flange width. The internal\nforces for stress constraint evaluations were available at this stage from\nNASTRAN analysis in step 1. Torsional stability of the ring cross-section was\nassumed to be provided by stringers which in the real structure intersect the\nring in relatively close spacing. The ring spacing, shown in Figure 3, remained unchanged for all experiments, as the Shanley criterion was satisfied by\na large margin for all values of the cross-sectional moment of inertia. The\nflow of computations shown in Fig. 2 was executed for several ring crosssectional moments of inertia.\n\n*For detailed description of the finite elements see NASTRAN manual (ref. 1).\n\n467\n\nTo conclude the description of the flow chart (Fig. 2) components, one has\nto mention that block 6 represents engineering judgment rather than an automatic cut-off criterion.\nThe computational power used in blocks 2, 3 and 5 was supplied by a CDC\n6600 computer while the FSD structural modifications block 4, were made using\na Hewlett-Packard 9100 B programmable desk top calculator. All data transfer\nwas done manually except for the transfer from block 2 to block 3 which occurred\nvia tape within the CDC computer.\n\nCOMPUTER EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nThe numerical ex periments have been carried out adopting the load intensity\nand shell dimensions shown i n Fig. 1, 3 respectively as representative of the\nnumerical values which occur in the design of transport aircraft. The\nstructure was assumed to be all-aluminum alloy with an allowable stress of\n1 9 . 61 x 104 kN/m2 (2000 kgf/cm2) .\nInfluence of Ring St i ffness On Stress Distribution Across Fuselage\nThe influence of the ring in-plane bending stiffness on the bending stress\ndistribution over the fuselage cross-section was investigated by assuming\nuniform stringer cross-section areas (5.2 cm2) and membrane plate thickness\n(0.1 cm) throughout. A single NASTRAN analy sis (blocks 1, 2, 3 in Fig. 2) was\ncarried out for each of the ring moments of inertia; low, medium and high\ncorresponding to 1.3, 65, 650 cm4 respectively. The low end of this range of\nvalues is characteristic of a typical transport fuselage design.\nFigure 4 shows stresses in stringers in the root bay obtained from this\nexperiment. It is clear that an increase in the ring bending stiffness causes\nthe stress distribution to approach that of elementary beam theory. Conversely,\na loss of stress occurs in comparison with that theory near the extreme crosssection fiber for low stiffness ring. This loss has an obvious adverse effect\non the structural efficiency in bending.\nInfluence Of Ring Stiffness On FSD Behavior\nHaving demonstrated the above relationship, attention was focused on the\nFSD behavior in the presence of varying ring bending stiffness. This was\nmotivated by the fact that FSD is currently being frequently used as a -tool\nin the structural design of fuselages. In this experiment, the computation\nillustrated by the flowchart in Fig. 2 (all blocks) was repeated for the\nfollowing five values of the ring cross-sectional moment of inertia: 1.3, 25,\n65, 200, 650 cm4. Figure 5 illustrates how the typical stringer area and plate\nthickness varied over five FSD iterations. Figure 5 also shows the stress being\nas ymptotically driven toward the allowable.\n\n468\n\nOne may note the so-called abnormal behavior of FSD in the 4th iteration\nfor the membrane plate in presence of the medium and high ring stiffnesses.\nThe thickness increased in this iteration, but so did the effective stress.\nThis occurs when the increased element stiffness attracts more force than may\nbe offset by the increment of the cross-sectional dimensions, resulting in\nlarger stresses in the element. This phenomenon usually signals ill-behavior\nof the FSD and is one of the shortcomings of that method. However, in this\nparticular case this abnormality was weak, barely discernible on the graph, and\ntherefore did not destroy FSD convergency. Figure 5 also shows that stringer\nand plate dimensions converge to different asymptotical values for different\nring stiffnesses.\nDistribution Of M\naterial For Different Ring Stiffnesses\nFigure 6 shows the stringer areas and the plate thicknesses as they\nresulted after five iterations of FSD in the presence of rings of low and high\nin-plane bending stiffnesses. The stringer/plate material distribution is\ndistinctly different for the two cases. For high ring bending stiffness, the\nlargest stringer is the one most distant from the neutral axis, while, the\nloss of stress in that stringer for low ring bending stiffness, illustrated\nin Fig. 4, causes the material to shift toward the neutral axis for such a low\nstiffness ring and as a result stringer No. 2 becomes the largest.\nAs one may expect, the former distribution is more efficient than the\nlatter (more material away from neutral axis) and, indeed, the total weight of\nstringers and plates for high ring stiffness amounts to 83% of the corresponding weight for the low ring stiffness.\nThis result suggests that increasing the ring stiffnesses has a beneficial\neffect on the structural efficiency of the stringer/plate assembly in bending.\nThe ring stiffness increase, however, carries a certain weight penalty which\nhas to be balanced with the stringer/plate weight reduction. This trade-off\nsituation indicates a possibility of the existence of an optimal ring stiffness.\nRelationship Between Minimum Weight And Ring Stiffness\nThe trade-off between stringer/plate weight and ring weight, determined\nfrom the ring sizing program (block 5, Fig. 2), is shown in Figure 7. This\ntrade off is consistent for all ring stiffnesses since the ring sizing program\nproduces the lightest possible ring for given set of constraints while, on the\nother hand, the stringer/plate weight is pseudo-optimalized by FSD. The\nreduction of stringer/plate weight, curve 1, and the increase of ring weight,\ncurve~. are both due to an increase in the ring stiffness. The total weight\nof the fuselage vs. the ring stiffness is shown by curve 3, which is the sum\nof curves 1 and 2. For this particular fuselage example, curve 3 shows a\ndistinct minimum in the vicinity of a ring bending stiffness equal to 25 cm4\nFor this case, a total reduction in fuselage section weight of approximately\n9% - may be realized or traded for about 7% to 10% of payl oad increase when\nconsidering the structural weight to payload ratio.\n\n469\n\nThe experiments described heretofore were based on a single load condition\nillustrated in Fig. 1. Two additional load conditions were analyzed without\nFSD application, to preliminary assess their effects on the above findings.\nThey were: internal pressure and tail vertical load. It was found for the\ninternal pressure (0,75 atm) case that stresses are negligible compared to\nthose generated by the load shown in Fig. 1. The tail load case analysis\nresulted in fuselage bending stresses which conformed to the elementary beam\ntheory regardless of the ring stiffnesses, due to the reinforced diaphragm\nthat closes the tail end of the fuselage. Thus the ring optimality problem\nin the sense defined in this paper cannot be posed for this loading case,\nThis statement may be elaborated upon as follows. The essential difference between the tail load and the load distributed as shown in Fig. 1 is\nthat the former does not have the gradient of the shear force on the fuselage\ncross-section in the longitudinal direction which is present in the latter and\nnecessary for the ring stiffness effects to appear. This may be explained as\nfollows. The stress distribution in the fuselage for the low ring stiffness\nappears to be similar to shear-lag in a torsion box. This shear-lag phenomenon\nin a torsion box is due to panel deformations in shear only, while in the\nfuselage, it is amplified by in-plane bending deformation of the rings. This\nin-plane bending will occur only when there exists a longitudinal gradient of\nthe shear force on the fuselage cross-section. In the present case, this\ngradient was due to the concentrated floor loads along the length of the\nfuselage section.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe following conclusions result from the above experiments. The in-plane\nbending stiffness influences the stress distribution over the fuselage\ncross-section when the loading case is such that a gradient of shear force on\nthe fuselage cross-section exists in the longitudinal direction. For rings\nwith low bending stiffness, there is a loss of stress in the fibers most\ndistant from the neutral axis.\nIncrease of the ring stiffness increases the ring weight and decreases\nthe stringer/plate weight which results in the existence of a minimum in the\ntotal weight function. A total weight reduction of up to 9% has been demonstrated by selecting an optimal ring stiffness. The optimal ring stiffness\nwas found to be considerably larger than the one required for overall stability\nof the stiffened shell according to Shanley 1 s criterion.\nNumerical experiments such as those described in this paper undoubtedly\nrequire a fast, reliable and convenient-to-use program to carry out repetitive\nstructural analysis. NASTRAN turned out to be such a tool, with the convenience\nof its input - output formats helpful in assembling other auxiliary programs\naround it.\n\nComputation times for one passage through the flow chart (F ig . 2) were:\n-NASTRAN analysis 106 CPU sec. 825 PPU sec.\n-Hewlett-Packard\n\n"on the machine time"\n\n5 min.\n\n-Manual data transfer 10 min.\n-Turn around\n\n1 day.\n\nThe conclusion is that the speed, reliability, and operational convenience\noffered by NASTRAN encourages its incorporation as a "black box" into computer\nprogram systems created specifically for a given purpose and that good\npractical results may be achieved in very realistic calendar time even without\na 11 hands off" interface between NASTRAN and its companion programs.\nAnother resulting suggestion is that the potential of such NASTRAN\ncentered computer program systems would gain enormously had there been a way\nto fully integrate NASTRAN with other programs into a repetitive loop.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nMcNeal, R.H.: The NASTRAN Theoretical Manual NASA SP-221.\nSept. 1970, chapter 5,\n\nNASA, OTU,\n\n2.\n\nShanley, R.

Courtney\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe practical application of NASTRAN in the structural analysis and design optimization of spacecraft structures includes the statement of design objectives, definition of\nloading conditions, creation of NASTRAN models capable of meeting the design objectives, and evaluation of numerical results to achieve the final design. Two approaches\nto modeling spacecraft structures are suggested. Specific examples of load definition,\nNASTRAN -modeling techniques, and methods of interpreting results are drawn from the\nanalyses of several spacecraft under study and design at Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC). These examples show that NASTRAN can be of practical use in designing an\noptimum structure in the initial phase of a spacecraft program.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nStructural analysis and design optimization of spacecraft begins with conceptual\nlayout drawings representing the configuration that best satisfies the systems requirements as defined by the members of the design team. The general arrangement of\nsignificant components and primary structure should be identified. Structural details\nsuch as material selection, cross-section design, and arrangement of secondary structure are the subjects for analysis and optimization.\nEarly introduction of NASA\'s NASTRAN program into the design process provides\na strong analytic basis for evaluation of options, knowledge of structural behavior, and\nimplementation of specific design objectives.\n\n479\n\nDESIGN OBJECTIVES\nA clear statement of the objectives for a specific design aids the structural analyst\nusing NASTRAN in developing the best mathematical models of the problem to obtain the\ndesired results. The degree of planning and of modeling detail is a function of the purpose for studying the structure.\nDesign objectives can range from merely establishing the adequacy of an existing\ndesign to requiring that the current configuration be evolved to one having minimum\nweight, minimum deflections, and evenly distributed loading for all significant static\nand dynamic loads.\nEach objective suggests very different approaches. For example, the analyst may\nchoose to demonstrate design adequacy of a spacecraft concept by verifying only certain\ncritical structural members by hand calculations or coarse-grid math models.\nRequiring an optimum spacecraft design suggests that the analyst must create both\na family of math models of the entire structure to demonstrate efficient load paths, and\na series of models of significant components to compare design alternatives, deflections, stresses, and loads.\nAssociated with defining design objectives is establishment of acceptance criteria\nfor evaluating analytic results of NASTRAN models, such as acceptable stress levels of\nmaterials , maximum deflection limits for critical - alignment components, and the desired structural behavior under load. Application of appropriate acceptance criteria to\nanalytic results guides the analyst to an acceptable design.\n\nDESIGN LOADS\n\nDesign loads used in the initial evaluation of spacecraft concepts are defined by a\ncombination of dynamic launch-environment loads including acceleration, vibration,\nand spin. To permit these loads to be applied statically to the primary structure of the\nspacecraft , its lowest resonant frequencies in both thrust and lateral directions are\nassumed initially to be at least a factor of two above those of the launch vehicle. This\nassumption is verified by frequency analysis of the NASTRAN model of the spacecraft.\nIf spacecraft and launch-vehicle resonant frequencies coincide, several approaches are\navailable:\n(1) Modifications to the structure may be required to change the spacecraft reso nance or to withstand increased loads.\n(2) The math-model results justify a coupled dynamic analysis of spacecraft and\nlaunch vehicle, which may result in a notching of the vibration spectrum of the launch\nenvironment.\n\n480\n\nTable 1 summarizes a set of static design loads that are typical of a Delta launch\nvehicle with a spin-stabilized third stage. These worst-case loads are based upon a\n2-sigma (2-cr) range of measured-flight loads multiplied by a 1. 5 factor of safety for\ndesign.\nIncreased symmetry in the environmental loads relaxes the requirement for complete NASTRAN modeling. The model must be adequate to react only to the most general load to be applied. For example, conditions 1 and 2 in Table 1 are axially symmetric with respect to the thrust and an arbitrary lateral axis.\nConsider a spacecraft symmetric about its thrust axis during launch, a frequent\nconfiguration for spin-stabilized spacecraft; then, a NASTRAN model needs to include\nonly half of the spacecraft divided by its plane of symmetry. Use of the proper boundary conditions at the cut plane simulates the symmetric reactions of the omitted half.\nThe axial load of condition 3 in Table 1 could be applied to the NASTRAN model of the\nsmallest segment of symmetric geometry, e.g., a one-eighth segment of a structure\nwith eight symmetric compartments.\n\nTable 1-Typical design loads for the Delta launch vehicle.\nLoad\nCondition\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nAxis\n\nSource\n\nLoad\n(g)\n\nThrust\nAny\nlateral\n\n3.0\n\nFirst and second\nstage\n\nThrust\nAny\nlateral\n\n15. 8\n\nThird stage\n\nThrust\n\n17. 4\n\nSpin\n(rpm)\n\nLift-off\n\n0\n3.5\n\n0\n3.0\n90\n\nCREA TING THE NASTRAN MODEL\n\nApproaches\nThe major problem in using NASTRAN to solve structural problems is the creation\nof a math model that sufficiently represents the structure to obtain accurate results\nwhile reducing the size of the problem to run efficiently on general-purpose computers.\nPractical experience has shown that complex NASTRAN problems requiring large\namounts of core and long time requests receive low priority on the computer, causing\n\n481\n\nlong dead times in the analysis. All modeling techniques should be directed toward\ncreating an individual problem to achieve the design objectives while running efficiently\nwith minimum core and time requests on nondedicated machines.\nTwo approaches used to answer specific design questions have been developed for\nstructural analysis of spacecraft: (1) creation of a family of NASTRAN models of the\nentire spacecraft with components differing between problems in arrangement and properties, and (2) development of NASTRAN models of individual structural components.\nIn the former the scope and complexity of the problem require structural features\nto be coarsely modeled with few elements and interconnections. Gross effects of loads\non the structure, such as load path and total deflection, are compared for successive\nconcepts to arrive at a final, evenly loaded configuration. Figure 1 shows as an example the half-spacecraft NASTRAN model of the Planetary Explorer spacecraft recommended in its Phase A study. * A GSFC document* * describes in detail the development\nof this concept-evaluation model.\nFor the second approach individual structural components can be modeled with\nadequate elements and connections yielding detailed values for local stress and deflection, thus permitting evaluation of subtle structural changes in a single component.\nLoads can be defined by the spacecraft design loads or derived from the results of the\ncoarse model of the entire spacecraft. Figure 2 shows the NASTRAN model of onetwelfth of the main platform for the Planetary Explorer consisting of 243 CQUAD2 elements. t This segment of the platform, represented by only two CQUAD2 elements in\nthe half-spacecraft model (Figure 1), was used to determine an arrangement of\nplatform-support struts to minimize midspan deflection and to investigate the structural impact of imbedding heat pipes in the core of the sandwich-material platform.\nTwelve platform-support struts were recommended for the entire platform. Addition\nof three circumferential heat pipes reduced deflection of the unsupported midspan by a\nfactor of two compared to the platform without heat pipes.\n\nModeling Techniques\nCoordinate Systems\nConvenient coordinate reference systems for the spacecraft are generally established at its interface with the launch vehicle, where input loads are defined and\n\n*\n**\n\nMarcotte, Paul G. , dir. : Planetary Explorer, Phase A Report and Universal Bus\nDescription.

Definition of reference systems at interfaces of components\nsupplied by various contractors can simplify exchange of structural data and models.\nAdditional coordinate axes can easily describe symmetric geometry, e.g., use of a\ncylindrical coordinate system only to define the truncated conical section of a spacecraft centerstructure.\nGRID-Point Patterns\nGRID points (the connection points of structural elements) are arranged in patterns to suit the purpose of the model. Coarse spacing permits load-path analysis,\nwhereas fine spacing accommodates modeling of structural details. Solution accuracy\nis directly related to the fineness of GRID arrangement. Regions of a structure for\nwhich detailed results are desired may be finely modeled, and regions of less interest\nmore coarsely represented.\nThe pattern of GRID points for surfaces modeled by plate elements should strive\nfor square quadrilaterals and equilateral triangles. The ratio of height to base should\nnever exceed 3: 1, because basic assumptions used to develop these elements are violated at higher ratios.\nBy preassigning different blocks of numbers for GRID-point identification to each\ncomponent of a spacecraft, the unmodified bulk-data decks of individual problems can\nbe merged to create a model of the entire structure, thus averting much of the tedious\njob of developing the bulk-data deck.\nProper sequencing of GRID-point identification numbers by initial assignment or\nresequencing with the SEQGP card minimizes computer storage and time requirements.\nThe decomposition of the coupled structural stiffness matrix, described in Reference 2,\nis simplified by reducing the bandwidth of coupled degrees of freedom and eliminating\nor greatly reducing the number of off-diagonal terms. In the NASTRAN model the\nanalyst strives to minimize the following:\n(1) The number of GRID points, each having six degrees of freedom, between successive sets of similar geometry.\n(2) The incidence of connections between sets of similar geometry to a common\nGRID point.\nA typical scheme for GRID-point sequencing of a similar set of structural geometry\n(Figure 3) begins with GRID - point numbers at the top of the structure, continues downward through significant connections of structural members, and ends at the point of\nconnection between adjacent sets of similar geometry. The initial bandwidth for this\nmodel is the number of degrees of freedom per GRID point multiplied by the number of\nGRID points in a set of similar geometry plus one, i.e., 6 x (18 + 1) = 114. This\ngrid pattern repeated at 13 stations at 15-degree intervals about the centerline forms\n\n483\n\nthe half-spacecraft model shown in Figure 1. The connection between GRID points 10\nand 500 represents the off-diagonal term that is treated as an active column in the\ndecomposition of the coupled-structure stiffness matrix.\nElement Selection\nThe structural analyst decides upon the desired behavior of each component and\nselects the appropriate NASTRAN finite element to implement that design. If a long and\nslender structural member transmits only torsion, tension, and compression, the\nCTUBE element should be chosen rather than the more general CBAR element, which\nincludes bending.\nThe following points have been very useful in the practical modeling of spacecraft:\n(1) Triangular plate elements provide the required transition between regions\ncoarsely and finely modeled by quadrilateral elements.\n(2) Lumped-mass elements (CMASS) conveniently represent undefined or illdefined components for which weight and mass properties are assumed or known.\n(3) Multipoint constraint (MPC) equations should be used to connect certain concentrated mass elements to the rest of the structure; however, these are complex and\ntedious to implement. A practical alternative is to provide the desired connection by\nfictitious CBAR elements with properties of high stiffness relative to the rest of the\nstructure, and no mass. A rigid connection is provided without adding weighted elements to the structure. This technique was used to connect the solid propellant motor\nto the center structure for the Planetary Explorer model, GRID points 500 and 10, respectively (Figure 3).\n(4) Use of NASTRAN utility programs described elsewhere* to generate coordinate,\ngeometry, connection, and property cards for certain restricted geometrical shapes\ngreatly reduces the tedious job of bulk-data encoding.\nProperty and Material Definition\nProperty and material characteristics must be defined consistently with mass\nunits, or with weight units used with the appropriate value for the parameter WTMASS\ndefined on the PARAM card.\n\n* Cook, William L.: Automated Input Data Preparation for NASTRAN. NASA GSFC\ndocument X-321-69-237, April 1969.\n\n484\n\nBoundary Conditions and Single-Point Constraints (SPC)\nWhen spacecraft symmetry permits the modeling of a segment of the entire structure, care must be exercised to constrain to zero the appropriate degrees of freedom\nalong the cut plane to represent balanced reaction by adjacent segments for loads acting\nparallel with the cut plane. Figure 4 shows that degrees of freedom 2, 4, and 6 in a\ncylindrical coordinate system are balanced and therefore set equal to zero for GRID\npoints along the cut plane of the hemicylinder.\nA major source of NASTRAN-job failures for a new model is GRID-point singularities arising from unconnected degrees of freedom. Degrees of freedom connected to\nelements for which no stiffness exist are conveniently set equal to zero by SPC cards,\ne.g. , rotation in the plane of a plate element is not permitted.\n\nEVALUATING THE NASTRAN RESULTS\n\nNumerical Results\nSeveral approaches can be taken in evaluating the numeric results of a successful\nNASTRAN job. For the math model of the entire spacecraft that has been modeled\nrelatively coarsely, specific results should be compared between several NASTRAN\nmodels representing structural alternatives to discern trends and effects caused by the\nmodification in structure. The significant observation is the change in value of a\nparticular parameter between configurations, not its absolute value, since its source\nis a relatively coarse model.\nIn the numeric results of a fine-grid math model of a structural component, primary emphasis is placed upon the absolute value of a parameter, e.g. , stress and\ndeflection. The criteria of acceptance defined by the analyst is applied directly to the\nnumeric results to determine the value of the analyzed design. The designer verifies\nthat the spacecraft-design criteria have been met, e.g., stress or deflection limits\nhave not been exceeded while ensuring that the member is contributing efficiently to\nan overall lightweight design.\nOne problem the structural analyst has is the volume of numeric results computed\nby NASTRAN. Additional evaluation techniques are required to communicate NASTRAN\nresults to other members of the spacecraft-design team for decision upon the final\nrecommended configuration.\n\n485\n\nNASTRAN Graphics\nStructure and xy-plotting generated by NASTRAN are extremely useful aids in\ninterpreting analytic results. Principal uses of structure plotting in spacecraft design\ninclude(1) Identifying modeling errors of geometry definition, element connection,\nboundary specification, and omission of elements, as shown in Figure 5 for a spacecraft configuration.\n(2) Visualizing relative displacements of complex models under combined loads.\nNASTRAN structure plotting capability used alone and in conjunction with a shadowing computer program, reported in Reference 3, provides a valuable tool in several\nnonstructural analyses required in spacecraft design. The desired spacecraft configuration is modeled only by geometry definition and PLOTEL elements, which merely\nconnect two points graphically when plotted. Varying the projection angles of the model\ncreates a series of plots that are analyzed to optimize the configuration. Thermal,\npower, and attitude control systems are aided, respectively, through depicting shadowing of one component by another, projected solar-array area, and center of pressure.\nAlternate configurations are compared by modifying geometric definition of the spacecraft model. A NASTRAN model (Figure 6) consisting of only PLOTEL elements was\nused to evaluate solar-a rray configurations for the Small Applications Technology\nSatellite study.\n\nUser Graphics\nOccasionally the user must create special graphic displays to augment those of\nNASTRAN for comparison of numeric results and communication with other members\nof the spacecraft-design group. A sketch (Figure 7) of the structural configuration\nwith loading, deflection, and forces for one of many configurations studied provided a\nconcise basis for evolving an optimum configuration for the Planetary Explorer study.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo aid the analyst, the following additions to the capabilities of NASTRAN are\nrecommended for implementation:\n(1) Provision for automated multipoint-constraint (MPC) equations calculated from\nthe initial configuration of specified degrees of freedom.\n(2) An option for a diagnostic computer run of the complete structural problem\nwithout execution of time-consuming mathematics.\n\n486\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nTypical conclusions from NASTRAN analysis of spacecraft structures include the\nfollowing:\n(1) A recommended structural arrangement for optimal loading and efficient\nstructural components evolved through concept-evaluation models of the entire spacecraft.\n(2) Specific values of engineering-design parameters (e.g. , stress and deflection)\nfor selected structures determined through models of individual components.\nNASTRAN has been an important practical tool in the structural design and analysis\nof spacecraft during the initial phase of certain spacecraft programs at GSFC. To ensure efficient design of spacecraft structures, the use of NASTRAN on current and\nfuture NASA programs should be encouraged and required.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Haggenmacher, Lockheed California Company\n\nCONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nANALYSIS, PURPOSE, AND STRUCTURAL MODEL\nDESCRIPTION\n\n2.\n\nDATA ORGANIZATION\n\n3.\n\nSELECTED STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS\n\n4.\n\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE USE OF NASTRAN FOR LARGE\nAIRCRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis report presents a brief evaluation of the NASTRAN system\nbased predominantly on a large airframe analysis performed for NASA\nAMES. In addition to this analysis NASTRAN has been used in the past\ntwo years for a variety of airframe structure analyses in support of\nprojects.\nThe NAST RAN system has been found to be very versatile, fairly\neasy to use when following the rigid format, with many outstanding\nfeatures.\n\n493\n\nWithin the scope and purpose of this paper, it is hardly avoidable\nthat the discussion can only point out selected features which were particularly helpful. Apart from this it is felt that an emphasis on problems,\ndifficulties and errors encountered in this work will be more helpful in\nthe further development of the system.\nThese applications were made in a production environment which\nincludes the use of unskilled help as well as skilled personnel with no finite\nelement experience. The effort was directed by a small staff with more\nthan ten years background in the field, which include the SST, Ll 011,\nand S3A operations and the use of other program systems. This forms\nthe background on which this use of the system was measured.\nPartly NASTRAN fulfilled and improved on many of our advanced\nrequirements; in other parts it does not have capabilities which we were\nused to; thirdly, and naturally, it still \xc2\xa3alls short of our pipe dreams.\n\n1.\n\nANALYSIS, PURPOSE, AND STRUCTURAL MODEL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe YF12 structural model analysis which is the main source for\nthis paper was performed under contract to NASA AMES, with three\n\npurposes in mind:\na)\n\nThe principal purpose of the work was to provide a detailed\nstructural model for internal load-stress analysis, as well as\nfor dynamic (model) analysis, to support an extensive test\nand flight test program.\n\nb)\n\nA second purpose is to use this analysis for an evaluation of the\npractical aspects of using NASTRAN for a large and complex\n\xc2\xb7a irframe analysis, and of the problems which may arise from\nusing the same detailed model for dynamic analysis. (Modal\nand flutter analysis .)\n\nc)\n\nA third purpose was to make such modifications to NASTRAN as\nwould either be necessary to accomplish the purpose or add\nconsiderably to the efficiency of the analysis. This aspect is\ndiscussed in a separate presentation.\n\nThe analysis model was developed in close cooperation between\nNASA AMES and the Lockheed California Company. It was deliberately\ndesigned to be somewhat more elaborate than what might be considered\nadequate \xc2\xa3or this type of aircraft. to more properly serve the purpose.\nIndeed the complexity of the model was doubtless very instrumental in\npointing out certain strong and weak points of the NASTRAN system.\nThe statistics of the model and a general view of the airplane it\nrepresents are shown in figure 1. The model may be considered rather\nelaborate for this type of craft and construction. The number of freedoms and elements used for the analysis of modern airliners may\nhowever easily exceed those of the present model.\nA top view of the total airplane model is shown in figure 2. It is a\nsymmetrical half-structure, with proper boundary constraints for symmetrical and anti-symmetrical conditions at the symmetry plane. The\ndetail includes all wing beams, wing ribs, nacelle frames and major\nfuselage frames. Secondary fuselage frames (2 for each main frame}\nare omitted. Additional chordwise wing caps, without ribs, are used\nto represent chordwise stiffness of the wing surface structure.\nElements used are exclusively:\nROD\n\n-\n\nelements for longerons, beam caps and chordwise\nsurface caps\n\nSHEAR\n\n-\n\npanels for skin and bulkhead shear\n\nBAR\n\n-\n\nelements for frames and selected longero.ns\n\nOn the fuselage and .nacelle all principal longerons are represented\nby Rod elements. To adequately define the circumferential contour of\nthe shell, additional points with longitudinally connecting rods and surface Shear panels are used. These secondary rods represent only a\nnominal axial stiffness of the fuselage and nacelle skin to adequately\nsubdivide the shell shear panels.\nThe fuselage frames do not coincide with the wing-beams~ note the\nexception of the two beams bounding the main gear well.\nThe wing-beam nacelle-frame joint fittings are modeled very\nclosely as trusses, the remainder of the nacelle frame is modeled by\nbar elements with offsets to represent the rather deep frames. The\ntransition from the truss to the BAR\' s is made by MPC equations.\n\n495\n\nA very large mnnber of MPC equations were used for a variety of\nproblems; more of this later. Membrane elements were not used for two\nmain reasons.\na)\n\nThe wing surface of the aircraft is designed for chordwise and\nshear-stiffness , very low spanwise stiffness and approximately\nzero Poisson\'s ratio.\n\nb)\n\nTriangular and quadrilateral constant strain membrane panels are\nnot sufficiently accurate in a widely spaced, non-square mesh\narrangement.\n\nFigure 3 shows a complete wing-beam nacelle-frame model assembly\nas plotted by NASTRAN. Detailed plots of this nature were used extensively\nwith great success for checkout. Overall plots of everything are very\nimpressive but of limited practical use. Model beams consist of an i nner\npair of RODS for main caps , and an outer pair presenting the (rather low)\nspanwise skin effectiveness. Plots of the outer wing and the aft fuselage\nare shown in figures 4 and 5.\n2.\n\nDATA ORGANIZATION\n\nFor an analysis project of this size , and with a large number of people\ninvolved in the data preparation phase, a tight organization of data preparation and checking is a key to success.\nTo achieve this an elaborate data numbering system was set up ab initio\nwhich proved a great help in org,anization, checking and cross referencing\nof the data . The NASTRAN BULK DATA ID system made it possible to\ncompletely integrate the NASTRAN identification into this reference system.\nA number of standard tabular forms were established for GRID- PS,\nSPC, MPC, and CBAR inertias and pin flags, to aid in the or.ganization,\nbookkeeping, cross referencing and data checking. For a large structure such\nas this, the property identification must be identical to the connection\nidentification. Approximately 15 different materials were used, and 6\ncoordinate systems for different parts of the aircraft.\n\nAll data identification numbers include a key which identifies the\nstructural part and the model-fuselage station where it belongs. That\nsame key is used for model drawing numbers and paragraph and page\nnumber for all back-up data and calculations.\n\n3.\n\nDISCUSSION OF SELECTED STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS\n\nThis section discusses the representation of some particular\nstructural problems using NAST RAN program features, other than the\nmore or less routine use of structural elements.\n\n3. 1\n\nMULTIPOINT CONSTRAINTS\n\nThe NASTRAN Multipoint Constraint Equation (MPC) is a very versatile\nand necessary tool. The equation\n\nrelates the dependent nodal displacement {ud}\nto the independent displacements {ui}\nSuch relations are needed in many places to express "rigid connections".\nUsually it is most convenient to visualize the relation directly in\nterms of displacements (equation 3. 1-1).\nThere are situations where determination of [Cd] and [Ci] in terms\nof nodal displacements runs into difficulties. Another relation than 3. 1-1\nmay be helpful.\n\nLet\n\n(3. 1-2)\n\nthen\n\n(3. 1-3)\n\nCorresponding to the transformation of displacements (equation -1 or\n-3), the transformation of the applied nodal forces is performed according\nto the following equation:\n(3. 1-4)\nIn many cases the matrix [c]T in equation (3. 1-4) is easy to form on\nthe basis of equilibrium considerations, replacing the load applied in a\ndependent freedom, {Pd)\n, by a set of loads ( Pi<:}\nin the independent\nfreedoms, which are in equilibrium.\n\n(3. 1-5)\nThe matrix [C] established by equation (3. 1-5) is then used to write\nthe NASTRAN MPC equation as in equation (3.1-3).\nAn example of the latter type is the relation of the displacement of\nthe engine CG, as dependent freedoms, to the displaceme.n t of the connection nodes. The relation (3. 1-5) is easy to form in terms of reaction\nat the engine mounts due to unit loads (and moments) at the engine CG.\nSee figure 6.\n\n3. 2\n\nACTUATOR SETS\n\nAnother practical example of the use of MPC equations are sets of\nactuators. A set of actuators for one control surface, operating on a\ncentral pressure source p cannot be represented by independent ROD\nelements. The YF model contains three actuators for the inboard elevon,\nsix for the outboard. (See figure 7.)\nAll actuator forces of a system of n actuators are linearly dependent\nupon a single variable, the basic pressure p ; they are rarely exactly\nparallel.\nThe actuator forces are:\n(3.2-1)\n\nwhere\n\nlAi} are the piston areas\n[p] is the system pressure\n\nThe forces acting on the structural points j from the actuator system\n{FjA}\nare related to the actuator forces\nAi} by the transformation\nmatrix [Ejd (c, n)\n\n[F\n\nThe actuator nodal forces are therefore\n\n(3. 2-2)\n\nCorresponding to the single pressure variable p (lb /in2)\na displacement variable ~ (in 3 } ls defined which represents the complete system (volumetric) displacement resulting from hydraulic fluid\ncompressibility and all hardware deflection as a function of the pressure.

In\nthe present case, as well as to represent torsion boxes in a CBAR\ngridwork, the NASTRAN CTWIST is not applicable, since it is\nexpressed in terms of moment vectors at the corners. What is needed\nis a torsion element leading to nodal forces as shown in figure 8.\nThis was accomplished (for two elements required only) by the\nsame principle as shown in 3. 2, expressing by equation 3. 2-2 the\nnodal forces due to the torsion moment, and the scalar element to\nrepresent the torsional stiffness.\n\n501\n\n4.\n\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE USE OF NASTRAN FOR LARGE AIRCRAFT STRUCTURES\n\nThe preparation of the YF12 model and data have led to a munber\nof observations which are critical of the system in its present form.\nSome of them appear to be serious necessities for the large scale aircraft use and demand solution more urgently than others which can be\nclassified more as luxuries. Their present status costs manpower and\ndelays; weighing them must determine the urgency with which we are\nto attack the solution of these problems. And while for many of these\nproblems the theoretical solutions are available to us, it would go far\nbeyond the scope of this report to enter into their discussion.\nThe observations are based on large aircraft analysis, such as\nthe one shown, as well as on a project environment and a large\nnumber of participants (non-expert).\n(See fig. 1.)\nMost of the criticisms involve inconsistencies, inconveniences,\ncost in manpower; few are lack of capabilities.\nCriticism does not necessarily imply that the NASTRAN programmer disregarded certain requirements or misjudged\nnecessities, but rather that within the framework and budgeting\nof the NASTRAN release a certain level has been achieved\nwhich leaves room for many significant improvements and\n"conveniences". Even at the present time some may already\nbe worked on by NASA or the maintenance contractor, some\nare worked on at our company.\n4. 1\n\nELEMENTS\n\nA detailed critique of the NASTRAN element library is not within\nthe scope and purpose of this presentation. We would however like to\nmake the following general comment concerning the element library\nsystem.\nThe wider the intended and actual user community of NAST RAN,\nthe more difficult, if not impossible, will it be for NASA to keep abreast\nwith all product requirements for finite elements. Also, as a central\nissuing agency NASA will likely be very deliberate before officially\nintroducing new elements. For the individual user the capability to\nreact with special elements to a given situation can acquire an urgency\nentirely different than NASA\'s or may have special element requirements of limited use for others.\n\n502\n\nIn the opinion of the author it is urgent to review the NASTRAN\nelement handling system with the goal to drastically simplify exchange\nor addition of new element types, not only for the purpose of element\ncheckout, but for productive use. Suggestions are\nA standard NASA issued element library similar to the present.\nExchangeable library packages for specialized users.\nUsers element package, with all elements controlled by the\nuser without NASA approval.\nAll elements should be usable together, where technically feasible.\n\n4. 2\n\nCHECKING FEATURES\n\nThe NASTRAN input data diagnostic is in most aspects very\nsatisfactory.\nSome rather time- consuming problems were discovered:\n1.\n\nMultipoint constraint equations. The diagnostic does not discover if a degree of freedom is used twice in the same equation,\nor the same D. O. F. is dependent in two MPG equations. The\nequation apparently is written incorrectly and the problem\nterminates during MPG equation reduction, without specific\nindications.\n\n2.\n\nA major problem arises from the gridpoint singularity checking\nprocedure. It is unfortunately quite inadequate, misleading,\nand thus requires a high degree of experience to be evaluated\nbecause it often gives an entirely wrong message.\na)\n\nThe check does not take into account stabilization by MPG\nequation.\n\nb)\n\nOnly single point sin,gularities (instabilities), relative to\nall other points being fixed, can be discovered, but not\nmultilinkage instabilities.\n\nc)\n\nIt frequently gives a singularity message for freedoms\nwhich are elastically perfectly stable.\n\n503\n\n3.\n\nSingularity of the complete K matrix is only discovered and\nlocated, if the singularity resulted in an absolute "zero" of\nthe pivot element. It should be possible to store the values of\nthe pivot elements in the process of reduction, and calculate\nthe values\n\n{s}\n\n=\n\n{KP}\n{KD}\n\nWhere\n{_KP}\n\nis a column vector of all pivot values coming up\nduring reduction.\n\n{KDJ\n\nis a column vector of all values on the diagonal of\nthe unreduced K Matrix\nan element by element division of the values in tKP3\nby the values in {_KD\\ .\nThe values in {s} will provide valuable information\non details of the "behaviour" of the K Matrix, and\non the location of singularities which result in very\nsmall pivot values.\n\n4.\n\nThe use of the NASTRAN Plot package for systematic pictorials\nof parts of the structure is a very valuable aid in checking the\ncorrect shape and element connections of the model structure.\nThe only drawback is the inability to provide titles identifying\neach plot.\n\n5.\n\nThe BALANCE OF EXTERNAL LOADS\nThe correct balance of an external load condition \'::PJ>lied by\nmeans of the various NASTRAN BULK DATA cannot presently be checked through the program except at the end of a run\nfrom the values in the static supports. It should be made\npossible to check the sum of all load components, and the\nresultant location, using the BULK INPUT for LOADS and\nGRIDPOINT COORDINATES only, before investing in a complete solution.\n\n504\n\n4. 3\n\n4. 3. 1\n\nBULK DATA USE\n\nThe philosophy of the NASTRAN data set appears to be that\nall load and constraint information needed to analyze the structural model under a great variety of loading, constraint, and\nthermal environment, is provided for on BULK DATA cards\nwith proper SET identification.\nThe rigid format, EXEC & CASE control cards then provide\nthe means of specifying the load and constraint condition for\nwhich provisions were made in the BULK data. These features\navoid a considerable amount of error-prone data card shuffling.\n\n4.3.2\n\nAn unfortunate exception to this principle is the SUPORT card,\nwhich is used to define fictitious supports, needed for\nstatic analysis with inertia relief. Only one card is provided\nfor in the BULK data; it has no identification and cannot be\ncalled for in CASE control.\nTherefore, it is not possible to make an inertia relief analysis\nfor different constraint conditions, such as symmetric and antisymmetric, from the same BULK deck (and thus from the same\nUMF tape) because it is necessary to exchange the SUPORT\ncard to replace fictitious supports for a symmetric freebody\nby those for an anti-symmetric freebody.\n\n4.3.3\n\nFor large number of load conditions as occur frequently for\nproject airframe analysis, the present CASE control system\nand stress recovery and output system practically excludes the\nuse of NASTRAN for the production analysis of the mass of flight\nmaneuver, gust and ground conditions involved in a complex\naircraft system.\na)\n\nIt is presently not possible to analyze more than 20 conditions in one run.\n\nb)\n\nA SUBCASE definition in CASE control is required for each\nnon-zero load column in the load matrix {P}\n\nc)\n\nOutput space is wasted in cases of displacement vectors\n(loads) zero, which causes a full set of output of zero\'s.\n\n505\n\nThese items are important under production environment of computer-mechanized design load formulation.\nIt should become an operational option that without any individual\nCASE control the displacement vector and stress output is produced\nfor every non-zero column (and only for those) of an input load matrix.\n\n4.3.4\n\nThe unique NAST RAN BULK DATA identification system\npermits the data ID numbering to be well integrated into an\nall encompassing identification system of model drawings,\nworksheets, backup data and cross references.\nThe pas sibility to group the input data into Subject-logical\nblocks is disturbed by the alphabetic order of the sorted\n"Echo", whereas the first letters of the card-code have not\nbeen used to group related data.\nCOORD system cards amidst the CONNECTION cards, Scalar\nPoints not with GRID points, BAROR-card not with CBAR 1 s\netc. This renders checking the 11 Sorted Echo 11 somewhat\nawkward.\n\n4.4\n\nMULTIPLE COORDINATE SYSTEMS\n\n4.4. 1\n\nThe capability of inputing gridpoint coordinates in a multitude\nof different coordinate systems proved to be a great advantage\nfor gridpoint coordinate input on the complex structure of the\nYF12, making it possible to use directly drawing measurements. The fuselage is in the basic system, the wing is\nrotated about the y axis, the elevons are measured relative to\nthe hinge lines, the nacelle relative to the engine CL, the\nrudder relative to its middle plane, rotated about the engine CL.\nA total of seven coordinate systems were used for input,\navoiding at that level a lot of work and errors.\nAnalogous however, any MPC, SPC, CBAR-OFFSET\nwould be most easily established, and input in the system\nused for the coordinates. Unfortunately NASTRAN requires\ninput for. above items in the global system which is chosen\nfor deflection output requirements, usually one standard\ncoordinating syst~m for the whole airplane.\n\n506\n\nThis requires large amount of manual transformation for MPG\nand OFFSET data, which are prone to errors. SPG, by its\nnature, is logically applied in the global system if nodal displacements are specified.\nFor the large number of MPG and GBAR OFFSETS used in the\npresent analysis, these proved to be the single largest headache\nin data preparation, errors and checking.\nAn MPG generator of considerable flexibility will considerably reduce work and errors.\nBending element offset, the majority would most conveniently\nand logically be specified in the local element system (particularly for shell frames and rings). An additional optional GBAR\nelement formula would be helpful.\nIn connection with the remarks above, experience has shown\nthat the single precision for the coordinate transformations is\non the IBM 360 system only marginally satisfactory. For\ncoordinates of the order of 2540 cm (1000 in.) or more (Fuselage\nStations), six digit accuracy results in some SPG and MPG\nleakage which is detrimental to checking reliability.\n\n4. 5\n\nTEMPERATURE\nSpecification of temperature at nodal points is\nfrom two points of viewt\n\n11\n\nwrong 11 input\n\na)\n\nTemperature is in the material and thus in the element,\nnot at the node. It is difficult to get realistic input on a\nmodel under these circumstances.\n\nb)\n\nIn thermal-finite element analyses the necessary input is\ndirectly produced from element data (not nodal data).\n\n507\n\n4. 6\n\nALTERS AND\n\nDMAP\n\nThe NASTRAN rigid formats are great convenience for a\nlarge munber of routine work, so is the ALTER capability to interrupt and reenter a rigid format string, a well designed feature, which\nis an absolute necessity for .a-p.y_of the more complex operations. The\nDMAP Modules and DMI ,Ma~rix input can be used for operation\nsequence inserted into a ri"gid format in this fashion. The DMAP\nsystem has however some major drawbacks:\n1.\n\nThe modules available for matrix operations and particularly\nmanipulatious are rather limited.\n\n2.\n\nThe format of DMAP instructions is rather cumbersome\ncompared to other matrix algebra instructions.\n\n3.\n\nThe direct matrix input card format, although quite general,\nuses a large number of cards, and is quite inconvenient for\nsparse matrices.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe analysis of the YF12 structure and the corresponding\nevaluation of NASTRAN has been the result of very satisfying teamwork, and a stimulating cooperation with the NASA AMES and\nEDWARDS personnel involved with the contract.\nIt was quite impossible within this report to touch on all\ninteresting experiences with the analysis system. The c r itical part\nof this review is intended as a constructive contribution by a team\nwhich is concerned with an intensive persuit of the further development of the NASTRAN system as a practical tool for large scale\naircraft analyses.\n\n508\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GRIDPOINTS _ _ _ _ _ 2700\n\ne ELEMENTS _ _ _ _ _ _ 7600\ne DEGREES OF FREEDOM..,......__\n\n_\n8000\n\ne HALF BANDWIDTH \xc2\xb7_ _ _ _ 270\n\xe2\x80\xa2 BULK DATA CARDS _ ____.18,000\n\nFIGURE 1\n\\J1\n0\n\\0\n\nNASTRAN MODEL STATISTICS YF-12\n\n\\Jl\nf-J\n0\n\nCl\nNACELLE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI I\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI:\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n: I;\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI ~___.__~_._-\'--..... 1_..__..........+-H.......U---..+-J+.-~~~..jj........j.U-U--1~-\'-\'\n:\n\nFUSE.

Douglas\nComputer Sciences Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper traces the background of NASTRAN documentation (i.e., the steps that preceded\nthe big push at final documentation) and analyzes the management and technical approaches to the\ndocumentation process. The management approach to NASTRAN documentation is reviewed to\nconsider how the whole effort might be improved if we were doing it again; and the technical\napproach is discussed with emphasis on specifications and standards. Some lessons learned from the\ndocumentation experience and the difficulty of putting these lessons into practice are then described .\nThe maintenance of NASTRAN documentation is reviewed with respect to the two updates already\nmade, and we conclude that because of proper planning the maintenance of NASTRAN\ndocumentation is off to a solid start. The paper ends with some thoughts on automated aids to\ndocumentation and some suggestions for the future. The Appendix provides a list of the style and\nformat specifications used in NASTRAN documentation.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn a seminar on automated documentation at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), organized\nby Mr. Darrin Gridley about a year ago, it was remarked that software documentation can be\ngenerally divided into two types. In Type 1 documentation, top level specifications are developed\nwhich describe in detail what the program is going to do (requirements analysis) and approval is\nobtained from the powers-that-be that this is the desired approach. The design is then broken up into\nsuccessively smaller segments, until the parts of the design are small enough that they can be assigned\nfor coding~ A document describing the design is generated before any code is written. In such a\nsituation, the program documentation is almost automatically generated prior to the writing of the\nprogram itself.\nType 2 documentation, on the other hand, arises when a computer programmer looks at a\nproblem, considers what the program is supposed to accomplish, writes the program, checks it out,\nand satisfies himself that the program does substantially what it is supposed to do. At that point, he\ncustomarily turns his back and starts to walk away, whereupon his supervisor shouts, "Stop, wait a\nmoment; you haven\'t finished yet- -you haven\'t documented!" "Oh, that\'s right," he says, and\nproceeds to pull together such notes as he can lay his hands on, supplement them with a couple of\ngeneral writeups to cover the more glaring omissions that he may note in the resulting sheaf of\npapers, and then toss them all onto his boss\'s desk with the air of one who has shown remarkable\n\n517\n\npatience to do such a job at all and should not be pushed too far. Noting this, his supervisor usually\ndoesn\'t complain too much. For one thing, he hasn\'t looked the document over carefully enough to\ncriticize it (even if he has the qualifications to judge). For another, he has already assigned the\nprogrammer to another crash program; and anyway , in many cases, the programmer has already left\nto join another organization. In today\'s depressed programmer market, especially in the aerospace\nindustry, the prima donna attitude of the Type 2 documenter and that "another organization" are\nbecoming things of the past- -but slowly, very slowly.\nThe NASTRAN documentation effort can be pointed out as an example of substantially\nType 1 documentation. Its beginnings were especially solid.\nIn January 1966, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) was awarded a contract for the\nprogram definition stage of what was then called the General Purpose Structural Analysis (GPSA)\nProgram. This definition stage consisted of the development of program requirements by NASA and\nthe generation of preliminary program designs by two teams of contractors, one of which was headed\nby CSC. The preliminary designs, documented in the form of Technical Evaluation Reports, were\ncompleted in April 1966.\nIn June 1966, GSFC awarded the development contract, NASS-I 0049, to the team headed by\nCSC, with the MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation the principal subcontractor. A document-as-you-go\n(Type 1) policy was initiated, with two main document types- ~the Mathematical Specification (MS)\nand the Functional Module Mathematical Specification (FMMS). In an MS, the analyst lays the\ngroundwork and then derives, in mathematical or logical terms, the necessary raw material that will\neventually find its way into the programming system. In an FMMS, the raw material of an MS is\ndeveloped to the "medium rare" point, so that a programmer can use it as a design and coding\nspecification.\nIn general, the writer of an MS was not required to be knowledgeable about the software\narchitecture. The FMMS writer, on the other hand, had to understand the analysis as well as its\nimplementation in the system. The FMMS contained a definition of the inputs to the module (or\nalgorithm if the specification spanned less than a module) and of the outputs, as well as a detailed\ndiscussion of the method , equations, logic, and restrictions.\nMS\'s were eventually used in large part as the raw data for the Theoretical Manual (TM); and\nFMMS\'s were heavily used as the raw data for the Programmer\'s Manual (PM). The data for the User\'s\nManual (UM) was gathered from various sources, including the static training course manuals, Input\nData Card Format documents, Output File Specifications documents, and Program and Data Flow\ndocuments.\nIn addition to the MS\'s and the other allied design documents, a variety of other materials were\nused in development of the manuals. In addition to the source code, these were:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n518\n\nThe rigid formats, evolved over the period of contractual performance, which described\nall data blocks and the modules from which they were output. They provided data for\nSection 2 of the PM and, of course, constitute much of Section 3 of the UM.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe descriptions of utility routines such as GINO and the packing routines. These\nbecame the basis for the subroutine descriptions that make up Section 3 of the PM.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA glossary of terms which was maintained on IBM cards as the project developed and\nwhich formed the basis of the NASTRAN Dictionary in Section 7 of the UM.\n\nMANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL APPROACH\n\nManagement Approach\n\nIn the fall of 1968, a schedule of incremental deliveries, on a section-by-section basis, was\nestablished for both the Preliminary Version and the Final Version of the three NASTRAN manuals.\nAt this time, I was appointed NASTRAN Documentation Manager, in which capacity I was\nresponsible for the quality and timely delivery of all three manuals. Additionally I was appointed\nEditor of the Programmer\'s Manual. Dr. Richard H. MacNeal and Professor C. W. McCormick of\nMacNeal-Schwendler Corporation were appointed Editors of the Theoretical Manual and User\'s\nManual, respectively. Figure 1 shows the organization of the documentation effort.\nThe writers for the three manuals (the programmers and analysts who had designed and\ndeveloped the system) spanned the three corporations in the NASTRAN consortium at that\ntime: Computer Sciences Corporation, the MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation, and Bell Aerospace\nCompany. This was matrix organization at its wildest and wooliest- -editors were screaming at editors,\neditors at writers, and writers at editors. Yes, Virginia, matrix organization implies teamwork through\nconflict (Reference I ).\nBecause of the very tight schedules imposed on the documentation staff, we sometimes went\nwithout such luxuries as typed drafts. Our biggest problem was Type 2 documentation symptom\nnumber 1- -we started too late. We began so late, in fact, that, in order to have a chance at making the\ndelivery schedules, we decided to eliminate the normal cycle through the technical publications\norganization and handle those functions ourselves, to the extent we could, in parallel with the actual\nwriting of the manuals. The TM and the UM would be done at the MacNeal-Schwendler facility in\nPasadena; the PM would be done at CSC\'s facility in El Segundo, thirty miles away.\nBecause of my two-hat role as Documentation Manager and Editor of the Programmer\'s\nManual, as well as the very tight schedule, one role had to dominate; and the Editor of the\nProgrammer\'s Manual won out. One might think that this would have caused many incompatibilities\namong the manuals. These incompatibilities, however, were kept to a minimum for two reasons: the\nunifying internal design document, MS-47, (Reference 2)- -see Technical Approach; and the\nunflinching dedication to NASTRAN documentation excellence on the part of Tom Butler, GSFC\'s\nNASTRAN Project Manager, and his staff. On the whole, therefore, the manuals were much more\ncompatible than might have been expected ; for example, one of the more conspicuous incompatibilities between the PM on the one hand, and the TM and the UM on the other, is the use of the word\n\n519\n\nNASTRAN\nDOCUMENTATION\nMANAGER\n\nTHEORETICAL\nMANUAL\nEDITOR\n\nUSER\'S\nMANUAL\nEDITOR\n\nFigure I. NASTRAN Documentation Organization\n\n520\n\nPROGRAMMER\'S\nMANUAL\nEDITOR\n\n"section" in the text when cross-referencing (e.g., "see Section 4.1.3"). The PM (incorrectly) uses a\nlower case "s" for section ; the TM and the UM correctly use "Section."\nI think, in retrospect, that it was a big mistake to have no professional writers assigned to the\nNASTRAN documentation team. In fact, if I had to do it all over again, I\'d opt for three editors,\neach supported by a full-time technical writer. Leading my organization would be a part-time\ndocumentation manager, assisted by a part-time technical writing supervisor, who would insure\ncompatibility of style across all three manuals.\n\nReview Cycle\n\nFor the PM, the sequence of events that led up to publishing the Preliminary Version of the\nmanual was:\xc2\xb7\n1.\n\nThe Editor developed major section outlines (sometimes these were annotated).\n\n2.\n\nThe Editor developed writing assignments and schedules.\n\n3.\n\nTechnical Staff personnel submitted handwritten material which was edited by the PM\nEditor.\n\n4.\n\nThe material was typed and Xeroxed (no proofreading was done by the typist).\n\n5.\n\nThe Editor proofed and performed a light re-edit of the Xeroxed copy.\n\n6.\n\nThe Editor returned a copy to the author for further proofing and changes.\n\n7.\n\nThe author returned his copy to the Editor, who in tum reviewed it and gave it to the\ntypist for corrections.\n\nWhen a major section was completed, five Xerox copies were sent to Tom Butler at the\nNASTRAN Project Office at GSFC for a two-week review. Tom and the Project Office staff reviewed\neach section microscopically and conducted round-table discussions. After the review was completed,\nTom Butler sent the Editor written comments which usually consisted of general comments\nembodied in a letter and specific comments annotated on one of the copies. Most often the\ncomments could be implemented by mortising the original typescripts.\nWhen there were serious disagreements between the Editor and Tom Butler, a phone call\nfollowed by a written confirmation usually settled them. The thoroughness and dedication of the\nGSFC review team were the necessary eohesive forces that eliminated the majority of inconsistencies\nin the Preliminary Versions of the Manuals.\nIt\'s interesting to note that although the writers and reviewers were separated by 3000 miles,\nan average of one phone call per week, of duration of from one to two hours, provided, in most cases,\n521\n\nadequate time for clarifications, explanations and, in some instances, negotiations. For isolated cases,\ndisagreements were settled in meetings between Tom Butler and the Editor when they happened to\nbe in the same place. However, disagreements never caused travel.\n\nTechnical Approach\n\nSpecifications for NASTRAN manuals were set during a six-month period of correspondence\nbetween Professor McCormick, Project Manager for the MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation and later\nEditor of the User\'s Manual, and Tom Butler. These specifications were published as an internal\ndesign document, MS-4 7 (Reference 2 ). They are presented in the first part of the Appendix of this\npaper, so that those who wish to update the manuals to reflect their own enhancements may conform\nto a single, well defined format. The first 29 items in the Appendix are, with some light editing, the\ncontents of MS-47. Items 30 through 41 are additional specifications that either evolved over the\nperiod of documentation or were tacit assumptions from the outset.\nAlthough the MS-4 7 format specifications were indispensible, standards for the typing of\nmathematical expressions and for flowchart symbols were lacking. Correct typing of mathematical\nexpressions is a difficult task; some of the principal roadblocks in achieving this are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA set of procedures for doing this specialized work is usually lacking.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThere are great variations in writers\' notations (how many ways are there to write the\nGreek letter "alpha"?).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMany typists have an ingrained prejudice against typing mathematical expressions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMany managers are unwilling to pay the price for quality mathematical typing.\n\nA good standard for mathematical typing is Reference 3. Even this reference, however, doesn\'t\nmention one of my pet peeves about the matrix notation in Section 3 of the User\'s\nManual- -namely, that the transpose operator, like the inverse operator, should be placed outside\n([A]T) rather than inside ([AT]) the matrix brackets. Why did I allow this notation to remain? The\nanswer is simple: to change it would have meant an increase in cost and a slippage in schedule that\ncould not be tolerated.\nNo standards for flowchart symbols were imposed on NASTRAN manuals. Writers and editors\nalike relied on what they recalled from past experience; and the subject of standards, as I recall, was\nnever brought up.\nIn some recent work of mine for GSFC, in which I am leading an effort to produce a Quality\nAssurance Handbook for the Telemetry Computation Branch of GSFC\'s Information Processing\nDivision, I recommended the adoption of the American National Standards Institute\'s (ANSI)\nstandard X3 .5 for flowchart symbols (Reference 4). An excellent tutorial by Ned Chapin in the use\n522\n\nof this standard is given in Reference 5, and I recommend it to anyone interested in software\ndocumentation standards.\n\nLESSONS LEARNED\n\nManaging the NASTRAN documentation effort taught me many lessons; among the most\niMportant are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProfessional technical writing guidance and support are needed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProofreaders independent of the author, the editor, and the typist are needed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCloser liaison among editors is needed. Better still would be either (a) a documentation\nmanager who doesn\'t have day-to-day editorial responsibility; (b) a centralized\nproduction shop of typists and proofreaders; or (c) both (a) and (b).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThere should be early agreement on format and subject matter.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStandards must be firmed up early. These include a dictionary, a style guide, standards\nfor mathematical expressions and flowchart symbols, and technical dictionaries or\nglossaries.\n\no\n\nModularity of documentation is essential.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProgramming (especially coding) standards should be integrated with documentation\nstandards.\n\nThese points are further discussed below.\nThe primary lesson I learned was: let the technical publications people do their thing. Because\nof the service orientation of such an organization, the range of capabilities can be quite extensive, and\nthis variance can be used to advantage. In other words, a set philosophy vis-a-vis the technical\npublications department isn\'t necessary; the manager can select those services that he needs or can\nafford.\nI think that the degree to which a project manager uses a publications organization will depend\nheavily upon his attitude (and, of course, that of his customer) towards the written word. If he\nbelieves it is extremely important to his effort (as I do), he is best advised to lean heavily on the\npublications department, even if some of his authors are frustrated junior Hemingways. I mean this\nfrom an editorial or technical writing point of view and not necessarily from an organizational point\nof view, although I don\'t exclude the latter.\n\n523\n\nMy experience has shown that proofreading cannot be accomplished adequately by the person\nwho typed the document; and to have the author do proofreading of his own is both inadequate and\nwasteful- -he can be doing something else. A junior editor should be assigned to this function.\nAs indicated previously, I fulfilled two roles. A better allocation of manpower would have been\nto keep the functional boxes in Figure 1 unchanged but to have different persons in each box. An\nadditional aid to uniformity would have been a typing and proofreading team centrally located and\ndedicated to NASTRAN documentation in general, rather than geographically spread out with\ntypists dedicated to only one manual.\nEarly agreement on format is necessary so that the impact of nonstandard items (e.g.,\ntypewriters, oversized mats) can be absorbed in the schedule. I was very fortunate to have MS-47 at\nmy disposal in plenty of time before writing and final typing began. However, we did not have an\nearly agreement on the contents of the manuals. This would have been much more of a problem if we\nhad not had the MS\'s, FMMS\'s, and other functional specifications.\nMy votes for standards go to: The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, the\nGPO Style Manual, A Guide to the Ty ping of Mathematical Notation (Reference 3), the ANSI X3 .5\nStandard Flowchart Symbols (Reference 4) and Datamation\'s "ADP Glossary" (Reference 6).\nDocumentation that will change often, as will NASTRAN\'s, must be designed modularly. I\nthink the manuals serve as good examples of modular documentation. A specific example is\nSection 2.3 of the PM. There, the functional organization of grouping data blocks output from a\nmodule, along with the technique of starting a new page for each module, allows the document to be\nupdated easily and in such a way as to preserve the current format.\nCoding standards can be established so that the code not only is self-documenting but also fits\ninto documentation standards. The only way to implement this idea is to design the\ndocumentation at the same time one designs the system.\n\nPUTTING THE LESSONS LEARNED INTO PRACTICE\n\nMost of the lessons learned from my NASTRAN documentation experience point up the fact\nthat quality documentation costs money, and lots of it. Reference 7, Manned Space Flight Center\nDocumentation Cost Guide, lists ten types of documents (handbooks, procedures, tech manuals, etc.)\nwith costs per page for each type. Costs include both preparation and production costs. These (total)\ncosts range from a minimum of $35 per page for a "normal" procedure to a maximum of $315 per\npage for a "complex" specification. The cost guide, which serves as a reference point for evaluating\nthe estimated cost of technical or management data of various types, does not define what\nconstitutes each type of manual. However, intuitively categorizing the NASTRAN manuals as\nhalfway between handbooks ($92 per page minimum, $171 per page maximum) and tech manuals\n($141 per page minimum, $233 per page maximum), and the degree of complexity as halfway\nbetween "normal" and "complex", then the cost of NASTRAN manuals should have been\n524\n\nsomewhere around $159 per page. Although I have no statistics to back it up (I didn\'t have access to\nthe NASTRAN accounting records, and even if I did , time spent developing preliminary specifications\nsuch as the MS\'s was not segregated from other tasks), I believe we did NASTRAN documentation\nfor less than this average price tag. I like to think it was done for less, not because of inferior quality,\nbut because of superior talent.\n\nMAINTENANCE\n\nProper maintenance of the manuals requires an intimate knowledge of both the manuals and\nthe system. Therefore, an integrated approach to NASTRAN maintenance is absolutely necessary ;\nthat is, corrections to the system must be reflected in the manuals concurrently . I think the\npublication of manual updates concurrent with the release of a new level of the system is a most\nnecessary postulate for orderly dissemination of NASTRAN. Experience has shown us that this is the\ncase.\nThe manuals have been updated twice, and the update procedure worked out as part of MS-4 7\nhas worked well. The original issue of the manuals was in October 1969 and corresponded to the\nso-called Phase I system. The six Phase II items were documented as manual updates dated\nJanuary 1, 1970, and March 1, 1970. These updates, along with document maintenance items\ncompleted under CSC\'s first NASTRAN maintenance task under Contract NAS 5-11723 , were\npublished in September 1970 as part of level 12.0, the general release level.\nUnder a second, recently completed NASTRAN maintenance task, also under NAS 5-11723,\nCSC produced over I 000 pages of changes and additions to the NASTRAN manuals. These\nincluded: the changes due to the MacNeal-Schwendler effort to develop and implement hydroelastic\nand thermal bending capability (NAS 5-11780); incorporation, as Section 6.8 of the PM, of the\n(NAS 5-10049) Fourteenth Quarterly Report which described the programming interfaces necessary\nto add structural elements; addition to the PM of a new section, numbered 7 and entitled Support\nPrograms (7.1 is an introduction, 7.2 gives programming details for the CDC 6000 Linkage Editor and\nSegment Loader, and 7 .3 describes the source conversion program.that generates a CDC 6000 source\ntape from a UNIVAC 1108 source tape) ; and a list of effective pages for each of the manuals .\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nOne of the most interesting facts that struck me when reflecting on my NASTRAN\ndocumentation experience was the difference between what we documented and how we\ndocumented it. The NASTRAN system is one of the largest scientific batch processing (as opposed to\nreal-time) systems known. The bulk of its code is machine independent, and the system runs on the\nthree third-generation computers most widely used for scientific applications. In contrast to the\nsystem, the documentation exists on camera-ready typescripts (mats)- -a production process that has\n\n525\n\nchanged little since World War II. Intuitively one feels that there must be a better way to update the\nmanuals- -automation naturally immediately comes to mind.\nOne tool that shortens the composing cycle for documents is IBM\'s Magnetic Tape Selectric\nTypewriter (MTST) system. The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation began using an MTST system to\nplace the Preliminary Version of the User\'s Manual on tape so that changes precipitated by the GSFC\nProject Office review could be incorporated easily. The use of the MTST system was discontinued\nearly, however, because the number and types of changes requested by GSFC were such that, in order\nto save valuable calendar time, mortising the Preliminary Version mats was chosen over the\nalternative of updating tapes and playing them back onto new mats.\nSince the format and style of the NASTRAN manuals are less fluid now than they were when\nthe MTST experiment was tried, it can perhaps be tried again, or better still, simulated and compared\nwith other automated aids to documentation that are available.\nUNIVAC has two automatic documentation systems that operate under Exec 8: the DOC\nproce_sor and UNADS, the UNIVAC Automatic Documentation System. I have seen only one\ns\nexample of a document produced by the DOC processor and one example produced by UNADS\n(which is the documentation of UNADS itself). There is no comparison; the UNADS document won\nhands down. A nice feature of UNADS is that it allows the user to construct an index automatically.\nAn overall index would be a welcome addition to each of the three manuals. Other additions\nI\'d like to see in the manuals over the months to come:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn index in Section 2.3 (Case Control Deck) of the UM that would list, in alphabetical\norder, each case control card mnemonic along with the alternative spelling, if any, and\nthe functional group (e.g., applied loads, constraint selections, etc.) to which the card\nbelongs.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn index in Section 2.4 (Bulk Data Deck) of the UM that would list, in alphabetical\norder, each bulk data card and the functional group (e.g., element definition, coordinate\nsystem definition, static load) to which it belongs.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA complete description in Section 5 of the PM of how to generate the absolute\nNASTRAN elements from the source tapes available from COSMIC.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransformation of Section 4.87 of the PM into a section of its own- -say, Section 8.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA table (in matrix form) in Section 4.87 of the Programmer\'s Manual which shows all\nelements versus capability (e.g., stiffness, lumped mass, coupled mass, output of\ncomplex stresses).\n\n526\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nSpecifications for NASTRAN Manuals\n1.\n\nOriginal image area will be 8-1/4 x 10-3/4 inches plus page number.\n\n2.\n\nFinal size will be 80 percent of original size.\n\n3.\n\nManuals will be printed on both sides of 8-1 /2 x 11 inch paper and punched for standard\nthree-ring loose-leaf binders.\n\n4.\n\nText will be typed on a 12-pitch IBM Selectric using LETTER GOTHIC ball number 005.\nCarbon ribbon will be used.\n\n5.\n\nMathematical symbols and Greek characters will be typed using SYMBOL IO ball number 061.\n\n6.\n\nDouble-spacing will be used except where groups of a few single-spaced lines separated by\ndouble-spacing for the groups is more desirable for clarity or appearance.\n\n7.\n\nParagraphs, including indented paragraphs, will be separated by 2-1/2 spaces.\n\n8.\n\nSection and subsection titles will be separated from the text and from each other by\ntriple-spaces.\n\n9.\n\nMajor section (e.g., 10.) and major subsection (e.g., 10.4) titles will be typed with uppercase\nletters.\n\n10.\n\nMinor subsection titles (e.g., 10.4.2 and 10.4.2.4) will be typed with lowercase letters, initial\ncapitals, and underlined.\n\n11.\n\nMajor sections such as\n10.

Hansteen\nThe Boeing Company\nRenton, Washington\n\nSUMMARY\nDuring the last five years Boeing Commercial Airplane\nDivision has heavily utilized very large capacity finite\nelement computer programs in production analyses 0f the 747\nand SST airframes.\nThis experience has led to the development of programs to assist the using engineer in preparation\nand interpretation of finite element data and to the development of algorithms with high capacity and efficiency to handle\nthe data processing requirements.\nIt is believed that what\nhas been learned is generally applicable to large finite\nelement problems and that any computer code, such as NASTRAN,\nmust eventually be configured to provide or interface with\nthe requirements described in this paper.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe information presented in this paper is the result\nof experience accumulated by members of the Boeing Commercial\nAirplane Division Structures Staff of which the authors have\nonly been a part.\nIt should be mentioned that the original\ndevelopment of the region and set algebra commands was the\nwork of Mr. Steve Komjathy of the SST engineering staff.\n\n533\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIt soon becomes obvious to any user of finite element\ncomputer codes that the data associated with the analysis is\nextremely voluminous.\nThe finite element analysis Boeing\nperformed on the SST airframe serves to illustrate this point.\nThe division of aircraft by substructures is shown in Figure 1.\nThe wing-body intersection was analyzed as a single elastic\nstructure because of ~he redundant attachment between wing and\nbody.\nThis required an interaction procedure to couple the\nseven substructures forming the idealization of the wing-body\nregion.\nSize characteristics for these seven substructures\nare given in Figure 2.\nEach substructure required ~n average\nof 60,000 input items to describe grid point loading.\nThis\ntotals to approximately two million input items for all\nsubstructures.\nThere were twelve internal load values computed\nfor each beam element and fifteen for each plate element.\nSymmetrical half structure was used requiring that both a\nsymmetrical and antisymmetrical boundary condition be processed.\nThere were forty generalized unit load conditions in the\nsolution.\nThese conditions were expanded to two hundred\nconditions by superposition.\nThe combined output for these .\nseven substructures contained over 100 million stress values.\nCab, forward body, aft body and empennage sections were also\nanalyzed.\nHence, the total volume of stress and displacement\nitems available for the airframe in a single analysis was in\nthe order of hundreds of millions.\nThe statistics given above may seem exaggerated to the\nuser who has never applied finite elements to large structures.\nHowever, considerably more data than that described is\ngenerated to complete the airframe design.\nFor example,\ngeometry, section properties and loads are updated and stresses\nand deflections recomputed for each succeeding configuration of\nthe airframe.\nIn addition, flutter and dynamic analyses are\nmade using response data generated from the finite element\nstiffness models.\nComputer codes are now available with capabilities,\ncapacities and efficiencies adequate for the analysis of\nany size structure Boeing is now producing or contemplating.\nIndeed, the present ability to produce stresses and deflections\nhas far exceeded the engineers\' ability to assimilate them\nwithout the assistance of the computer.\nComputer code for\ngenerating data, plotting, data checking and generating of\nreports has, in the past, been looked upon as a luxury.\nIn\nfact, they are . an absolute necessity if the engineer is to\n\n534\n\neffectively utilize the finite element method in analyzing\nproblems of the size and complexity of the SST airframe.\nA finite element capability may be viewed from two distinct\nvantage points.\nFirst is the finite element theory and computer\ncode.\nIn just one decade theory and codes have developed from\na few severely limited mistrusted programs to the high capacity,\nhighly efficient and universally accepted structural analysis\ncapability of today.\nThird generation computers, efficient\nmatrix arithmetic algorithms and substructuring technology have\ngiven capacities that are essentially limited only by economics.\nHowever, the development of theory and computer code is of\ninterest to the production analysis and design engineer only\nto the extent the code is reliable and to ~he extent he understands the theory and the preparation and interpretation of\ndata.\nThe application of finite element capability on production aircraft has brought pressure for the development of\ncomputer codes to assist in the preparation and interpretation\nof data.\nIt has also brought a change in the administration of\nthe analysis work.\nThe massive amounts of data and the\nunforgiving nature of the computer have produced a requirement\nfor assembly line like production and control methods.\nAlso,\nunlike hand analysis methods where answers are forthcoming\nalmost on demand depending on how much the engineer is willing\nto assume, the finite element programs do not yield any answers\nuntil they yield all answers.\nHence the second vantage point is\nthat of the production engineer and his management.\n\nManagement and the production engineer have learned that substructuring is a necessary tactic for:\n(1)\n\nDivision of structural analysis responsibility between\ncontractors\n\n(2)\n\nDivision of the structure according to group responsibility\n\n(3)\n\nDivision of the analysis by major structural assembly\ncomponents\n\n(4)\n\nIterating a single substructure for configuration and\ndesign studies while using contiguous substructures\nas boundary conditions\n\n(5)\n\nRefining the grid of a subregion for a more detailed\nanalysis while using the response of the entire region\na s boundary conditions for the subregion\n\n535\n\n(6)\n\nComputer code and hardware capacity and reliability\nconsiderations\n\n(7)\n\nImproved bandwidth or equation conditioning.\n\nOnly the last two are associated with the computer.\nSubstructuring has the added advantage of allowing parallel\npreparation and processing of data and of permitting\ncommunication of technical information between contractors\nin a precise and mutually understood form.\nThe subject is much too broad to cover in a single\npresentation.\nRather, some comments on data generation,\nchecking and interpretation are given followed by a\nformulation for substructure analysis and a discussion\non some associated matrix arithm e tic algorithms.\n\n536\n\nDATA PUPAJltATION AND INTERPUTATION COMPlrl\'El\\ CODF.S\nData Generation\nGeometry and element generation schemes depend upon the regularity of\nthe structure. Code for automated generation of total data sets is desirable\nand necessary for analysis of solids .because of extensive repetitiveness and\nbecawse the three dimensional arrangement makes it difficult for the engineer\nto visualize the grid points and elements. Automated generation of tot&l.\ndata sets also serves well in space structures that have perfect (or near\nperfect) symmetry. Many structures, however, appear regular but, in fact,\nare highly irregular structurally. Aircrai\'t, for example, appear regu1ar for\naerodynamic reasons. In actuality, the supporting airframe is grossly\nirregular because of access and lightening holes, equipment installations and\nthe like. For this type of structure, it is effective to provide repeat\nfactors and short segment generators in the bulk data language. For example,\nstatene~ts of the type\nl\\\xc2\xa2Dl 1\n*+3 1\n\n5.6/\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\n.2/\n\nexpand to\n~\xc2\xa2Dl\n!\xc2\xa2D2\n:rt\xc2\xa2D3\nl\\\xc2\xa2D4\n\nl\n3\n\n3\n\n7\n\n7\n9\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5.6/\n5.8/\n\n6.o/\n\n6.2/\n\nsuccessively adding the factors in the second statement to those in the\nfirst statement. The* and+ identify the statement type and give the\ndirection of the increment. Many other statements are easily developed.\nThese data statements can easily be interpreted and expanded as they are\nread, resulting in a f\'ully expanded data set.\n\nby\n\nThe advantages of these statements are:\n(1)\n\nthey reduce volUlle\n\n(2)\n\nthe reduction in data volU11e reduces the incidence of error\n\n(3)\n\ndata errors extend over a larger number of statements when expanded\nand are therefore more detectable.\n\n(4) they are easily included in the bulk data statements.\nVery large analysis tasks, such as the SST airframe, typically require\nthat many engineers access essentially the same input data. If each engineer\nresearches or computes his own, the arbitrary choices that inevitably present\ntheJ11Selves result in some differences in the same data produced by different\nengineers. In this instance, it is advantageous to create master files of\n537\n\ndata including the entire airframe. Such a master dimension file was\navailable for geanetry data on the SST. Section property data could\nsimilarly be provided and updated for succeeding design iterations. The use\nof master data files ensures that the entire engineering group is accessing\nidentical infoI\'llatioa. Hence, load and stress groups and groups aodeling\ninterfacing substructures voul.d use compatible data.\nAnother useful. concept is substructure extraction.\nbeen applied in two ways:\n\nThis concept has\n\n(1)\n\nSubstructure Division - In this procedure the data for the entire\nstructure is prepared and checked as a single data set. A computer\ncode is then used to divide the set into consistent substructure\ndata sets c011plete with correspondence tables necessary for\ninteraction and backsubstitution. The extraction process eliminates\nerrors in coordinates at substructure interfaces. It also provides\na ready aeans of redefining substructures.\n\n(2)\n\nAnalysis of a Subregion - In this procedure, a data subset is\nextracted from the substructure data set after the substructure\nanalysis has been completed. Hence the data subset is extracted\ncomplete with deflection boundary conditions. If the deflections\nfor every freedo\xe2\x80\xa2 computed in the larger substructure are applied\nas specified deflections at every freedom in the data subset,\nreactions are obtained around the boundary of the subregion\nresulting in an equilibriWD freebody. This is a surprisingly\nefficient procedure for obtaining fret,!bodies. The efficiency 1s\nobtained because the reactions are computed by a direct :matrix\n\xe2\x80\xa2ultiplication without having to solve a system of equations.\n\nLoads generation computer codes essentiall.y convert loads originally\ncomputed for airloads panels, cargo, pressure, etc., to a statically\nequivalent set of grid point loads. The volume of loads data nearly alwaye\nexceeds the volume of grid point and element data. Airframe loads are\nc011puted for a balanced aircraft (all load conditions S\\111 to zero). Hence\n\xc2\xb7a loads generation computer code is essential for redistributing the loads\nand maintaining the force balance.\nData Checking\nThe volume of data in large structures works against hand checking\nbecause of the hypnotizing effect that page after page of tabular data has\nupon the human mind. Computer code can be generated to assist. However, in\na complete sense, data checking is beyond the capability of the computer\nbecause it does not have access to the total set of information used to\ncreate the data, nor is the computer able to exercise judgement. Hence,\ndifficult as it is, the only complete check is an item-by-item review by\nsomeone using the familiar red and blue pencil.\n\n538\n\nTo be effective in assisting the checking process, several different\ncapabilities should be available. Sane of those used at Boeing are:\n(1)\n\nFormat check - Computer code is used to report data items that are\nincorrectly formated.\n\n(2)\n\nGeometry and element connectivity check - Plotting is the only effective\nmethod of detecting errors of this type. The selection of view and\nsea.le is critical to remove hidden lines and to bring the small.est\nallowable error within the resolution of the plot.\n\n(3) Consistency check - Computer code is used to detect such items as\nduplica~e grid point identifiers, re-entrant corners in quadrilateral\nplates, warped quadrilateral plates, unacceptable definitions of beam\nprincipal planes, radii shorter than one ha.lf the distance between\ncurved beam end points, and the like. Computer code is a.lso used to\ncheck coordinate matching across substructure interfaces.\n\n(4) Accuracy check - Errors are detected by placing bounds on the data item.\nFor example, Young\'s modulus for most meta.ls is greater than one\nmillion lb/in2 and less than 50 million lb/in2. Values outside this\nrange can be detected and a warning message printed. Errors within the\nbounds are more difficult to check and genera.lly yield only to an\nitem-by-item hand check.\nThe form in which data errors detected by computer code are presented to\nthe user is important. It is poor practice to print an error number\nreferencing a fuller description in a manual. It is much better to (1)\nprint a descriptive statement that is accurate and complete and (2) print\nthe precise card image or location in which the error occurs.\nIdeally, data checking\nThis is not possible if the\nlost. Good recovery can be\nreadily identifiable header\ncan search for in the event\n\ncode should locate all errors in a single pass.\nerror is such that the1 data checking code becomes\nprovided, however, if the data is divided by\ncards or delimiters that the data checking code\nit becoaes lost.\nData Updating\n\nLarge volumes of data cannot be managed by- hand in card deck form.\nSimple activities such as reading the card decks into the computer or\ncorrecting data by inserting new cards have an intolerable error probability.\nA better procedure is to place the data on magnetic tape or permanent disk\nfil.es. This requires an updated program with the\nfollowing\ncapabilities:\n(1)\n\nSorting - Large data sets are necessarily keyed. for sorting. This\nrequirement stems from creating the data in separate sets and then\nmerging them into a single canplete data set.\n\n539\n\n(2)\n\nUpdate Functions - Update functions a.re based on sorting keys. Sorting\nkeys may be simple ascending numbers in columns 73-8o; a composite\nnumber in columns 73-80 based upon grid point, element, loadcase and\ncard function; or the grid point, element and load.case identifiers\nthemselves. A workable set of update functions includes DELETE, CO~T,\nREPLACE, INSE!tT.\n\nThe result of the update operation is a new master data tape containing\nupdated card images. The old :master data tape is preserved unaltered.\nInteractive Data Checking and Updating\nIf a computer with permanent files and time sharing is available,\nconsiderable engineering nowtime can be saved by error checking and\ncorrecting from an interactive terminal. A simple text CKT terminal is\nadequate and can be located in the engineering work areas because of its\nsilent operation. Working copies of updated files can be obtained by batch\nprinting from the terminal. As data is read, the checking prograll detects\nerrors and displays a descriptive message along with the offending card image.\nThe correction is ma.de directly from the terminal keyboard. Data updates\nmay be made directly by paging to the appropriate location and using the\nupdate commands.\nProcessing Cheeks\nExcept for the basic truth that the finite element input data must be\nprocessed to obtain deflections, stresses, etc., the processing of data is\nof no interest to the engineer. His interests lie simpzy in the translation\nof structure into coded data and the interpretation of results.\nBeyond answers, the engineer requires two things from the processing\nstage. First, if the processing fails because of data errors (such as\nequation dependency) not detectable in the initial data checking,"the engineer\nneeds to knov the exact location of the error in the data. Traditional\nconditioning numbers giving overall evaluation of the stability of an\nequation set have little practical value. Equations of the order of many\nthousands are being routinely solved. The detection of specific dependencies\nin such large sets and the association of these dependencies with the\noriginal finite eleaent data is a practical necessity in the production\nenvironment. Boeing has successfully implemented an algorithm that detects\ndigit loss on an equation-by-equation basis. The offending equation is\nspecifically identified with the corresponding grid point and freedom. This\ncheck has proven invaluable to production engineers in locating conditioning\nproblems stemming from dependencies or nea.r dependencies.\nThe second item required by the engineer is an equilibrium check of\nloads and reactions. Although there are limitations to the validity of this\ncheck, its existence at least gives the engineer the assurance that the\nloads have been carried through the structure to the support points. \xc2\xb7 Thus\nhe has more than faith and hope to support the accuracy of the solution.\n\n540\n\nPostprocessing\nThe task of analyzing and interpreting the data output from the\nprocessing stage is formidable even for small structures. For structures of\nthe size being discussed here, aost of the ve.lue of the analysis is lost\nwithout the assistance of the computer in extracting, manipulating and\ndisplaying pertinent data. Plot programs that show deflections, stress\ncontours, bending manent curves and the like are invaluable. However, the\ngreat voll.Dlle of data available in comparison with the relatively small. amount\nof data required by each engineer makes the continual massaging of the total\ndata set inefficient. Boeing is currently developing a postprocessing\ncomputer code in an attempt to cope with this problem.\nThe postprocessor is designed to accept data generated by other programs\nand to manipulate, interpret and display this data a.s directed by userdefined instructions through the control program. The postprocessor is\nprovided with a read interface for each program the postprocessor interfaces.\nOther than at the read interface, data stored on postprocessor files is\nindependent of the data source.\nExtraction\nThe extract capability allows the mer to extract those specific items\nof data from the finite .element output that are of interest to him.\nEspecially designed accessing_ and mapping routines are used to locate and\nextract data items in an economically efficient manner from large volumes of\ndata. The extract capability immediately reduces the volume of data to that\nparticular subset needed by the user. All types of data ~ be extracted\nand placed on the postprocessor files including data from different finite\nelement processors, different substructures, coordinates, deflections,\nstiffness properties, internal loads, etc. AlJ. data items placed on the\npostprocessor files are identified in postprocessor dictionaries and may be\naccessed singly or in groups using the dictionary entries.\nKeport\n\nThis module allows the engineer to print tabular reports by naming items\nto be printed and giving their location on the page. The report module\nallows the insertion of titles, page headings, page footings and column\nheadings.\nPlot\n\'?his module allows the engineer to plot data stored on postprocessor\nfiles.\nSuperposition\nThis module allows the engineer to scale and canbine data.\n\nSpecial. Functions\nThese include modules to cal.cul.ate Mc/I! P/A, transform coordinate\nsystems, determine maximum or critical. conditions, computer margins of\nsafety, dump buckl.ed plate loads into adjacent frames, etc.\nltegion Commands\nThe region commands are a method of extracting data groups from specific\ngeometric regions of the structure rather than naming the data item by item.\nScne typical. commands and their result are as follows:\nname/PLANE Nl N2 N3 BY width/INCLUDE string/EXCLUDE string/\nThis camnand identifies a region identified by "name" consisting of a\nplane defined by grid points Nl, N2 and N3 with a thickness of "width". The\nplane extends to infinity. All grid points lying within this region will be\nextracted. Grid points outside the plane~ be included or those inside\nexcluded from the set using the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE commands. A "string" is\ngiven in the form Nl THltU N2 BY N3 where Nl is the beginning identifier, N2\nis the ending identifier and N3 is the step size. The statement may be of\nthe form Nl THRU N2 BY N3 or Nl THRU N2 or Nl. Any number of statements may\nbe included in the string, separated by commas as:\nNl TlfflU N2 BY N3, Nl THRU N2, Nl, Nl, Nl THRU N2, etc.\n\nOther region commands are of the form:\nname/ CYLINDER Nl TO N2 BY radius/ INCLUDE string/EXCLUDE string/\ndefining a circular cylinder with end points and centerline defined by grid\npoints Nl and N2 and radius as specified.\nname/TUBE Nl TO N2 BY string/INCLUDE string/EXCLUDE string/\ndefining an irregular cylinder the same as the circular cylinder except the\noutside boundary is defined by a string of grid points projected paral.lel to\nthe tube centerline defined by Nl and N2.\nname/LIST string/\ndefining a list of grid points making up the set. Specific data is extracted\nfrom the regions by commands such as the following:\nFETCH name BF.AMINLD MXl MX2 FXl FX2\n\nresulting in beam internal loads MXl, MX2, FXl, FX2 being extracted for all\nbeams with the region previously defined as "name".\n\nSet Algebra\nSets of data extracted by the region commands may be combined using set\nalgebra instructions of the form\n\nJUK\n\n(union of sets J and K)\n\nJI K\n\n(intersection of sets J and K)\n\nCJ\n\n(complement of J)\n\nThe commands may be combined as\n\n(JU K) (C (MIN) U J)\nInstructions are interpreted left to right and from innermost to outermost pairs of parentheses. Typically, data is divided into many small sets on\nthe postprocessor files. Set algebra commands allow the user to combine sets\nin a variety of ways.\nSummary of Observations\nThus it is seen that large fini t e element problems create the need for a\nrange of data handling computer programs to ensure that the management of the\ndata is accurate, reliable and efficient.\nSubstructuring has also been shown to be a necessary tactic for the processing of large finite element problems. Central to the effectiveness of a\nsubstructuring technique is the efficiency of the formulation and the supporting\nmatrix arithmetic/storage algorithms.\n\nSUBSTRUCTURING\nGeneral\nThe analysis of structures by the finite element method\ninvolves the generation and solution of (large) iystems of\nlinear equations.\nThese equations represent equilibrium\nconditions at the nodes of the structure, and are expressed\nin terms of the nodal displacement - force relations.\nWhether a structure is analyzed by a substructure technique\nor a total structure approach, the system o~ equations to\nbe solved is essentially the same provided an identical\nelement idealization has been made.\nThe actual difference\nbetween the two approaches is expressed by the sequence in\nwhich the equations are generated and solved.\nIn the total\nstructure approach generation of all the equations is\ncompleted before a solution is carried out.\nIn the substructure analysis several subsets of the complete system\nof equations are first established independently.\nA\npartial solution is performed on each subset by eliminating\nequations which do not couple with equations in other subsets.\nThe remaining equations are then combined and a final solution\nis carried through.\nThe results of the two approaches would be identical if\ncomputations were to be carried out with infinite accuracy.\nHowever, since computers can only perform finite precision\narithmetic, the two solutions will in fact differ _\nsomewhat.\nThe discrepancies in the results will in the majority of\ncases be outside the range of practical importance.\nM\nethod\n\nThe substructure analysis consists of the following four\nmajor phases:\nIdealization -- The structure is divided into a number of\nsubstructures which in turn are being idealized by a finite\nelement representation.\nIn each substructure there will be\nsome grid points which connect to other substructures; these\ngrid points are referred to as "interact" grid points.\nOther\ngrid points will be unique to one substructure.\nThese grid\npoints are called "internal" grid points.\n\n544\n\nReduction -- The equilibrium equations for each substructure\nare independently formed and a partial solution is carried\nthrough with respect to the displacement components at the\ninternal grid points.\nThe reduced system of equations\nrepresent modified equilibrium relations for the interact\ngrid points.\nInteraction -- The total structure is connected by enforcing\ncontinuity conditions along the substructure interfaces, and\nby adding the equilibrium equations for the interact grid\npoints.\nA solution for the displacements at these grid points\nis then carried out.\nBacksubstitution -- In the backsubstitution phase the displacements\nat the internal grid points of a substructure are\ncomputed.\nWhen all displacements are known, the element\nstresses may be calculated.\nFormulation\nThe basic systems of equations for a substructure may be\nexpressed by the following matrix relations:\n\nK\n\n00\n\nK\n\nT\nK\n\nK\n\nT\nK\n\nK\n\nOS\n\nOS\n\nA\n\nK\n\nu0\n\np\n\nOS\n\noa\n\nK\nas\n\nua\n\np\n\nas\n\nK\nss\n\nus\n\np\n\noa\n\n0\n\n(1 )\n\na\ns\n\nmore compact form for the same relations is:\n\nKU = p\n\n(2)\n\nIn the above equations the following notation has been used:\n\nK\n\nThe stiffness matrix of the structure\n\nu\n\nThe vector of grid point displacements\n\np\n\nThe vector of grid point loads\n\nu0\n\nThe set of displacements at the internal grid\npoints.\n\nua\n\nThe set of displacements at interact grid points\n\nu\n\nThe set of displacements which have a prescribed\nvalue\n\ns\n\nA partial solution of equation (1) is carried through with\nrespect to the U0 displacements.\nFrom the first matrix equation\none obtains:\n\nu0\n\n= K\n\n-1\n\n(P\n\noo\n\no\n\n-\n\nK\n\noa\n\nU\n\nu )\na -

(13) will generally be\nlarge and must be located on secondary storage devices such\nas disks or magnetic tapes.\nTransformations on the matrices\nare carried out in a piece-wise manner by bringing relatively\nsmall subpartitions of the matrices into the central unit of\nthe computer at the same time.\nThis strategy may require\nrecycling of matrices through the central memory area a large\nnumber of times.\nFor this reason the requirement of an\nefficient data transfer strategy becomes a major concern.\nThe primary goal of this strategy should be to minimize\nthe total amount of data that has to be transferre~.\nIn the\ncase of matrix multiplications substantial benefits can be\nobtained by studying the storage format of the product\nmatrices (row-wise or column-wise representation), and the\nrelative sizes of the subpartitions of the product matrices\nand the result matrix.\nOther factors that should be considered\nare overlapped transfer on separate storage units and overlapping of incore processing and data transfer.\n\n548\n\nFigure I.

Carlson\nTechnology Utilization Office\nNASA Headquarters\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration established in 1962 a\nformal program to transfer the results of its research and development activities to applications in non-aerospace sectors of the economy. The program is\ninstitutionally operated by the Technology Utilization Office at NASA Headquarters and by TU Officers within each of the NASA Field Centers. When the\nprogram got underway, and technological developments began to be reported by\nNASA employees and contractors, it became clear that one particular kind of\ntechnological product was developing which should be handled a slightly different way than other R&D work sponsored by NASA. Accordingly in 1966, NASA\nestablished a focal point to evaluate and disseminate its computer programs.\nThe Computer Software Management and Information Center (COSMIC) is operated\nfor NASA by the University of Georgia at Athens, Georgia.\nCOSMIC is interesting because it is the only element of the Technology\nUtilization Program which combines the functions of evaluation and dissemination of new technology; traditionally these functions have been separated because the capability to do the two tasks generally does not reside within the\nsame organization. Generally when new technological developments are reported\nby NASA scientists and engineers as well as contractor employees, they are\nevaluated according to criteria including novelty, significance, technical adequacy, and potential for non-aerospace application. In general, the same criteria hold true for our evaluation of computer software. Over the years, our\nevaluation techniques and procedures have become more specific and refined as\nour experience grew; and as a better understanding of documentation requirements and evaluation procedures developed within the data processing industry\nand in the multiplicity of standards groups in existence. The requirements for\ncomplete and thorough documentation are probably more demanding for our purposes\nthan in any other kind of function, since every program disseminated by COSMIC\nmust be capable of third party use; i.e. by people who may have no knowledge of\nthe specific nature of the R&D program which necessitated the original software\ndevelopment. Other criteria for computer program acceptance in the COSMIC inventory have also changed over time: one of the obvious changes is that since\nthe inventory has now grown to a level where we have over 900 programs available for dissemination, we now receive programs which are substantially identical to items already in the inventory, and must make a judgment as to whether\na new software submission has enough unique features to merit its inclusion.\n\n551\n\nThe COSMIC program has evolved into a successful dissemination activity\nwhich currently provides a significant number of programs to users who are able\nto benefit from the existing investment in the Nation\'s space program. In\ncalendar year 1970, COSMIC disseminated over 2500 software 1,ackages. Traditionally, our software dissemination has been limited to the public and private\nsector organizations in the United States. However, we have just completed negotiations for our first international exchange of software on a quid E.!\xc2\xa3_ quo\nbasis. NASA programs, of course, have always been available to foreign organizations engaged in joint research proj_ects with NASA, however this is the first\ninstance where the exchange has taken place based on purely economic and technical considerations, i.e. the trading of programs judged to have approximately\nequal value and utility. This exchange involves two NASA programs, which were\ntraded for two programs developed by the Tokyo Research Laboratory of the\nJapanese firm, Hitachi Ltd. The two NASA programs are now being transmitted to\nJapan, and we will soon be receiving the Japanese programs in return. The exchange process in this case was long and rather laborious negotiation of successive steps to determine continuing mutual interest, but we look forward to\nfurther exchanges, many of which are now in the early stages of negotiation,\nwith a somewhat simplified exchange procedure. Thus, we will now have a situation where two Japanese programs, previously unavailable in the U.S., will be\navailable to U.S. users at no more than the cost of reproduction of the program\nand documentation, in exchange for two NASA programs which have already been\npublicly available in the United States for several years.\nAs many of you know, COSMIC programs are announced to potential users\nthrough the Computer Program Abstracts Journal which is published on a quarterly\nbasis by NASA. When programs are received and evaluated by COSMIC, abstracts\nand technical descriptions of machine and language requirements, program size\nand price, are prepared by COSMIC and forwarded to our printing and composition\nfacility for inclusion in CPA Journal. The Department of Defense joined NASA\nin the COSMIC effort in 1968, and after some initial delay, their programs are\nnow beginning to flow into the Center, and are also announced in the Journal.\nWe feel that there is clear evidence that users in the American public and\nprivate sectors have already gained significant economic and technical benefits\nfrom the public availability of this software, originally developed in response\nto NASA mission requirements. One of the best examples which illustrates this\npoint is the public availability of NASTRAN. Since many of you have now had\nsome experience in developing NASTRAN applications, I am sure you can attest to\nthe significance of having available to you, a program for which the original\ndevelopment cost has been estimated at over $3,000,000. As new applications of\nNASTRAN continue to be developed, whether here at Langley under the guidance of\nthe NASTRAN Systems Management Office, or in industrial or other governmental\napplications, we will do what we can to help in the exchange of information\nabout useful applications, to continue to make the most of this opportunity to\ncapitalize on an existing investment in research and development. I hope that\nmany of you will continue to take an interest in NASA technological developments, and will investigate other programs,. as well as NASTRAN, which we are\nmaking publicly available on a continuing basis through the Technology\nUtilization Program.\n\n552\n\nNASTRAN EXPERIENCES OF FORT WORTH OPERATION,\nCONVAIR AEROSPACE DIVISION OF GENERAL DYNAMICS\nby Mer le Allen\n\nProject Structures Engineer\nConvair Aerospace Division, General Dynamics\n\nSUMMARY\nThe preliminary and updated versions of NASTRAN have been\nacquired and implemented on the facility\'s IBM-360 computing\nsystem. After implementation of the preliminary version (level\n8.1.0), a series of small exploratory problems were solved to determine the procedure\'s accuracy, usability, and economy. Seven\nof the rigid formats and DMAP were used. Structure and x-y plots\nwere obtained. The results indicate that NASTRAN is easy to use\nand is accurate. It is not economical for small problems because\nit is both general \xc2\xb7purpose and programmed for large problems.\nFollowing the high degree of success realized with the small\nproblems, . the procedure was released for general internal use .\nNASTRAN familiarization courses were prepared and taught in-plant\nby this writer. Two significant F-111 problems, consisting of\nbuckling of the wing carry-through box cover plates and canopy\nnormal modes, were analyzed.\nThe updated version (level 12.0.0) was acquired in December\n1970 and implemented on an IBM 360/65/65/50 at a cost of 40 programming manhours and 1.0 computer hour. It is currently being\nused in a NASA study on Advanced Transport Technology.\nINTRODUCTION\nBoth the preliminary and updated versions of NASTRAN have\nbeen acquired and implement~d on the Convair Aerospace Division,\nFort Worth Operation\'s IBM-360 computing system. The preliminary\nversion implemented was level 8.1.0; the updated version was\n12.0.0. Acquisition was from the Computer Software Management and\nInformation Center (COSMIC), a National Aeronautics and Space\n553\n\nAdministration (NASA) sponsored non-profit facility located at the\nUniversity of Georgia.\nImplementation of the \xc2\xb7 preliminary version was completed 5 May\n1970. It was accomplished by members of the company\'s professional programming staff for a cost of 180 programming manhours and 3\nIBM-360 computer hours. Approximately half the computer time was\nused to solve some of the sample problems obtained with the procedure. Most of the implementation cost was incurred because of two\ndifficulties encountered; these are discussed below.\nThe updated version was acquired 21 December 1970, and its\nimplementation was finalized 12 March 1971. Again, the task was\naccomplished by company programmers and the costs were 40 manhours\nand 1 computer hour.\nBecause of their large size, both versions of NASTRAN have\nbeen loaded onto (and operate from) a reserved disk pack (IBM\n2316).\nTwo significant operational problems were encountered during\nthe implementation of the preliminary version. The first involved\nthe input data, which require IBM 7090 graphics. The keypunch\npersonnel normally punch IBM 360 graphics and use equipment designed for that purpose. When IBM 7090 graphics are required \xc2\xb7\n(only four characters are different from the IBM 360), the same\nequipment is used and a special switch is depressed to obtain the\nIBM 7090 characters whenever they are encountered. Because the\nkeypunch personnel rely on their memory to obtain the IBM 7090\ncharacters, numerous errors were made, which led to NASTRAN aborts.\nThis first difficulty was circumvented by coding a small pro~edure that reads the input data in either IBM 360 graphics, 7090\ngraphics or a mixture of both and converts it to IBM 7090 graphics\nwherever required. It acts as a front step to NASTRAN and executes automatically with it whenever NASTRAN is used. Hence, the\ninput data may now be keypunched in IBM 360 graphics.\nThe second difficulty involved the magnetic tapes which\nNASTRAN produces for the Stromberg Carlson 4020 plotter. NASTRAN\nproduces a 7-track tape; the Fort Worth Operation plotter requires\na 9-track tape. This problem was resolved by coding a small procedure which operates independently and converts the NASTRAN-produced 7-track tape to the 9-track used in plotting. It possesses\nthe disadvantage of requiring an extra computer run; presently, it\n554\n\nis being used on an interim basis since it is planned that NASTRAN\nwill be modified at a future date.\nPRELIMINARY EVALUATION\nFollowing the implementation of the preliminary version\n(level 8.1.0), NASTRAN was used to solve a series of small exploratory type problems. This approach was taken because of the\nlimited budget and time available and the necessity of validating\ncertain facets of the procedure before releasing it for general\ninternal use. The problems were thus tailored toward the objective of validating:\n1.\n\nthat the implementation was successful\n\n2.\n\nthat those finite elements and modules most likely to\nbe used in aircraft type analysis were operational and\naccurate\n\n3.\n\nthat the problems could be solved without undue user\ndifficulty.\n\nBoth static and dynamic problem types were solved. The static\nproblems consisted primarily of performing a stress analysis on a\ncantilevered beam, a wing spar, and an anisotropic membrane, all\nunder mechanical loads or predeformed; solving for internal loads\nof a pressure-loaded isotropic plate; performing a column buckling\nanalysis; and solving for stresses of a skin-stringer arrangement,\nloaded thermally. In all cases, answers were made available for\ncomparison with NASTRAN, either through solution on a desk calculator or by other finite-element procedures. Multiple load conditions were used in some cases.\nThe finite-element types used included the bar, rod, shear\npanel, quadrilateral and triangular membranes, the triangular\nhomogeneous plate encompassing both membrane and bending, the\nquadrilateral bending homogeneous plate, and the quadrilateral\nnonhomogeneous element encompassing both membrane and bending\ndegrees of freedom.\nThe results indicate the existence of two procedure errors.\nFirst, solutions were not obtained (in one computer pass) for all\nload conditions when a load condition change included changes in\n555\n\nthe boundary\npass for all\nconditions.\nsequent load\nrection.\n\nconditions. Solutions were obtained in one computer\nload conditions prior to the first change in boundary\nRestarts were then made to obtain solutions for subcases. This situation was reported to NASA for cor-\n\nSecond, the anisotropic-membrane problem was first idealized\nby use of the quadrilateral membrane element. This element yielded\nincorrect loads and stresses. However, this error had already\nbeen catalogued by COSMIC so that its use in a problem of this\ntype was inadvertant. A switch in elements to the triagular membrane yielded accurate results.\nThe dynamic problems solved consisted of calculation of\nnatural modes of vibration and associated frequencies and frequency and transient response. Natural (normal} modes were calculated\nfor a fixed beam, a free beam, and a composite plate through use\nof rigid format 3. DMAP was used to calculate normal modes and\nfrequencies for a structure, where the stiffness and mass matrices\nhad been calculated in procedures foreign to NASTRAN. Both the\ndeterminant and inverse-power methods were used. Resulting modes\nwere plotted successfully through use of the SHAPE and VECTOR\nfunctions, but superposition of the two was not successful. Natural-frequency calculations were compared against results obtained\nwith closed-form solutions for the beams and against test for the\nplate. Accuracies were well within engineering requirements in\nall cases.\nThe subject of both the frequency and transient response\nanalyses was a simple beam. In each case, both the model and\ndirect approaches were used. For the frequency-response problem,\nthe load type was discrete. The distribution of load along the\nbeam span was arranged to have the same shape as that of the first\nmode; hence, only the first mode contributed to the response. The\nload magnitude varied linearly with frequency. A solution to this\nproblem was manually obtained on a desk calculator and the NASTRAN\nmodal and direct results were compared against it. Results showed\nthe NASTRAN solutions to be correct; however, the answers were\nprinted in magnitude and phase-angle format (per user instructions) and were mislabeled \xe2\x80\xa2~eal/Imaginary\'\' in accordance with the\nCOSMIC catalogued discrepancy. Split-frame x-y type plots were\nobtained, but the data plotted was incorrect after having been\ncorrectly printed. Plot requests were for magnitude on the upper\nframe and phase angle on the lower, both plotted versus frequency.\n556\n\nTransient response results were not obtained by other means\nfor comparison with NASTRAN. However, the modal and direct results compared closely and appeared reasonable. Displace.ments,\nvelocities, accelerations, and element loads were plotted versus\ntime in NASThAN. The plots were correct.\nFAMILIARIZATION AND APPLICATION\nFollowing the high degree of success realized with the small\nexploratory-type problems, the preliminary version was released\nfor general use. A NASTRAN familiarization course was prepared\nfor structural analysts and was taught in-plant after normal working hours by this author. The course was given twice so that all\nthe interested personnel were accommodated. Each course spanned\nseven weeks, with classes held twice weekly. Class duration was\none hour, for a 14-hour-lecture course. Thirty-two analysts completed the course.\nNASTRAN has now been utilized in analyzing the F-111 airplane\nin two significant problem areas. The first consisted of a static\nstress and buckling analysis of the upper and lower cover panels\non the wing carry-through box structure. In the lower-panel problem, 150 elements and 150 joints (639 degrees of freedom) were\nused. It executed in 1888 central processing unit (CPU) seconds.\nIn the upper-panel problems, 250 elements and 138 joints (602\ndegrees of freedom) were used. It executed in 1895 CPU seconds.\nThe NASTRAN r .e sults compare closely with results previously obtained by other means, with NASTRAN yielding slightly higher buckling loads. Lower cover results were about 3 percent different;\nupper-cover results were less than 10 percent different, the exact\namount being dependent on the boundary conditions used.\nThe second F-111 problem for which NASTRAN was utilized consisted of obtaining the natural modes for an updated-type canopy\npreparatory to a flutter analysis. In this problem, 118 elements\nand 75 grids (135-size dynamic matrix) were used. The CPU time\nfor the first three modes (obtained by the Inverse Power Method}\nwas 1354 seconds. A restart was then made for additional modes\nand frequencies. No other results were available for comparison.\nThe flutter analysis, which used the modes, indicated a stable\nstructure, without cockpit pressurization; subsequent flight flutter tests confirmed the analysis.\n557\n\nAt this writing, NASTRAN (level 12.0.0) is being used in a\nNASA study of Advanced Transport Technology.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe following conclusions are predicated on the results of\nthe small exploratory problems and the F-111 applications to date:\n1.\n\nBy virtue of the 12 rigid formats and DMAP, the versatility of NASTRAN far exceeds that of other existing\nprocedures.\n\n2.\n\nIt is surprisingly easy to use for so large and complex\na procedure. The numerous usability features (such as\nthe diagnostics, restart, tailoring of the printed output, and plotting) make it easier to obtain solutions,\ninterpret results, and present data.\n\n3.\n\nEngineering accuracy requirements are satisfied for\nthose modules and finite elements exercised, with some\nexceptions as noted.\n\n4.\n\nComputer run-time requirements (on a single computer-pass\nbasis) are not competitive for small problems but should\nbe competitive for large problems. Utilizing the rather\nextensive restart capabilities of NASTRAN could easily\nmake it more economical for moderate-sized problems,\nrelative to other finite-element procedures.\n\n558\n\nA SPECIAL NASTRAN PROGRAM FOR INPUT CHECKING AND\nUNDEFORMED STRUCTURE PLOTTING\nBy Willianna W. Smith\nNASA Langley Research Center\nINTRODUCTION\nThe NASTRAN computer program, which has become a very frequently used tool\nfor structural analysis, requires a vast amount of data preparation for its\ninput. Errors in data occur which the user must find and correct before he\ncan get a successful computer run. Extensive diagnostics are provided within\nthe NASTRAN program, but due to the impact of the large field length (amount\nof central memory) required for execution on the multiprograming/multiprocessing\nmode of computer operation, turn-around time can be rather lengthy. This, of\ncourse, causes the user considerable delay in the completion of his analysis.\nThis paper describes a program for the CDC 6000 computer which helps the user\ndebug his input cards more rapidly; the i deas are applicable to other NASTRAN\ncomputers.\nREQUIREMENTS\nAn investigation was launched to determine the possiblity of providing\nthe user, in a considerably smaller package than the regular NASTRAN program,\nthe capabilities of having his input data deck checked and a plot of the\nundeformed structure produced.\n\nBecause of the queuing priorities for operating systems built around\nmultiprograming techniques and the hardware requirements for execution (core,\ndisk storage, etc.), a maximum of 28,672 words (70K octal) of central memory\nwas chosen as a desirable field length to attain. A program of this size would\nnot only allow for more rapid access to the computer, but would permit job\nsubmittals through remote terminal facilities.\nIn addition, the program was to be generated from the current level (12.0)\nof NASTRAN in such a way that it could be easily updated for future levels,\nif necessary.\nPROGRAM AREAS INVESTIGATED\nA DMAP sequence to accomplish the input data analysis and plotting is\nillustrated in the NASTRAN User\'s Manual, page 5.4-3 and requires execution\nof the following NASTRAN modules:\n\n559\n\nA.\n\nExecutive Preface Modules\n1.\n2.\n\nInput File Processor, Part 1 (IFPl)\n\n3.\n\nExecutive Bulk Data Sort (XSORT)\n\n4.\n\nInput File Processor (IFP)\n\n5.\nB.\n\nExecutive Control Section Analysis (XCSA)\n\nInput File Processor 3 (IFP3)\n\nFunctional Modules\n1.\n\n2.\n\nGeometry Processor - Phase 2 (GP2)\n\n3,\n\nPlot Set Definition Processor (PLTSET)\n\n4.\nC.\n\nGeometry Processor - Phase 1 (GPl)\n\nStructural Plotter (PLOT)\n\nExecutive DMAP Modules\n1.\n\n2.\nD.\n\nSAVE\nSet Values (SETVAL)\n\nOutput Module\n1.\n\nPrint Message (PRTMSG)\n\nLink 1 and Link 2 of the regular NASTRAN program contain all modules\ninvolved but 32,768 (100K octa~ words of core are needed to load the routines this is exclusive of buffers and work area necessary for execution.\nIn an effort to reduce core requirements, subroutine descriptions were\nscrutinized to determine which, if any, could be excluded from the overlay\nstructure. Open core r equirement s for the various modules were reviewed\nand SYSTEM par ameters defining the length of buffers and indexes were examined\nas poss i ble areas for increasing available core.\nALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO THE REGULAR NASTRAN PROGRAM\nBased on the preliminary findings, the decision was reached that the\ndesired goal could be accomplished and construction of the necessary overlay\nstructure was begun.\n\n560\n\nThe Special NASTRAN program has a s its basis Links O, 1, and 2 of the\nregular NASTRAN progr am. All modules not required for the DMAP sequence have\nbeen r emoved and subroutines dealing with checkpointing, restarting and\nxy- pl otting h ave been eliminated from the links.\nAfter the required object decks and control cards for the overl ay\nstructure ( see figs. 1.0, 1.1, 1. 2, and 1.3 ) were processed by the Linkage\nEditor, computer runs were made using an arbitrary existing rigid format statements not needed having been eliminated with ALTER cards - and the NASTRAN\ncard for changing system parameters at execution time. Parameters varied were\nMAXFIL (maximum number of files to be added to FIAT), NBRMST (length of master\nindex), NBRSUB (length of subindex) and SYSBUF (number of words in a GINO\nbuffer).\nWhen t he desired results were obtained efforts were directed towards\nmaking all alterations invisible to the user. The following changes were\nmade at the source level and new object decks produced.\n1. Input and output buffer length set to 201 (octal) on progr am card of\nthe Fortran program NASTRAN.\n2. Punch file declaration removed from program card of the Fortran\nprogram NASTRAN.\n3, In the principal Block Data program for NASTRAN ; MAXFIL reduced from\n32 to 18, NBRMST reduced from 62 to 10, NBRSUB reduced from 126 to 50 and\nNBRCBU reduced from 530 to 30,\n\n4 . Length of a GI NO buffer, defined in subroutine BTSTRP, reduced from\n1166 to 140 .\n5, DMAP s equence made into Displacement Rigid Format 18 containing 15 DMAP\ninstructions. This required writing subroutine LD50 (fig. 2.0) to create the\nDMAP and Decision Records for the Executive Table XCSA.\nAll other existing LDi routines RENAMED LD50 - at the SUBSYS level - so\nthe us er does not have to change his solution number in order to use the special\nprogram.\nCAPABILITIES OF THE SPECIAL NASTRAN PROGRAM\n1.\n\nAnalyzes all input data cards.\n\n2 . Provides a plot of the undeformed structure, if so directed by the\nproper structural plotter control cards.\n3.\n\nExecutable in 28,672 (70K octal) words of central memory.\n\n561\n\nLIMITATIONS OF THE SPECIAL NASTRAN PROGRAM\n1.\n\nDisplacement Approach must be used.\n\n2.\n\nDoes not contain checkpoint or restart capabilities.\n\n3.\n\nPlotter output restricted to the DD 80 B microfilm plotter.\n\n4.\n\nNo punch output available.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThe Special NASTRAN program, in meeting the intended goal of\nchecking and undeformed structure plotting within 28,672 words of\nas its input the data deck of a regular NASTRAN run. This allows\nto utilize both programs without intermediate changes in his data\n\ninput\ncore, accepts\nthe analyst\ncards.\n\nLINKEDIT LET,OUTFILE=NAST(T),PARAM(4)=20, PARAM(51=50,\nPARA~(6)=6000,PARAM(2) =1200\n.\nLI BR ARY I\\ASTOBJ\nLINK O\nSPLKCOOl\nRENAME SYSTEM= SYSTE~.\nSPLKOOC2\nRENA~E\nPEXIT = LII\\K20.\nSPLK0003\nRENAME MSGWRT = LII\\K20.\nSPLK0004\nRENAME GINOIO = 1066CC\nSPLK0005\nRENAME XBACKSP = XBKR EC\n$ COULD BE REMOVED POSSIBLY\nSPLK0006\nRENAME RWUNLD = RETLRN\nSPLK0007\nRENA~E XRE~O(I06600)=REAOX\nSPLK0008\nRENAME XWRITE(l06t00)=WRITEX\nSPLK0009\nINSERT SYSTEM, XI\\STRN\nSPLKOOlO\nINCLUDE I\\ASTOBJ(BLKDATA(T[ME))\nSPLKOOll\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(NA\xc2\xb7STRAN,\nBLKDATA(GIN066) ,CONMSG)\nSPLK0012\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(IC6600,GINO,DUMP,RETURN,OPEN,BCKREC,CLOSE,EOF,FWORECI\nSPLK0013\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(READ,REWIND,SKPFIL,WRITE,XGINO,XEOT,TMTOGO,WRTTRL,RDTRL)SPLKOOl4\nINCLUDE I\\ASTOBJ(WRTTRLZ,MESAGE,FNAMEI\nSPLK0015\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(OPNCGR,WRTCOR)\nSPLK0016\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(RDCCR,CPNCORZ,PRELOC,LOCATE,PRELOCZ,SS~TCH,GOPEN)\nSPLK0017\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(FREAD,CLSTABI\nSPLKC018\nENTRY NASTRA~\nSPLK0019\nEND\nSPLK0020\n\nF igur~ 1. 0\n\nLINK l\nRENAME\nSETC = RETURN\nRENA~E NTRAN=DUMP $ 11ra DECK ONLY\nRENAME SEARCH=DUMP $ NGT USED ON THE t400/6600\nRENAME\nSYSTEM= SYSTEM. $ RENA~E T~E CDC SYSTEM ROUTINE tALLS\nRENAME\nPEXlT = L H,K20.\nRENA~E XCR\n= XCRF\nRENAME\nLDOl = LOSO\nRENAME\nL002 = LOSO\nRENAME\nL003 = LOSC\nRENAME\nL004 = LOSO\nRENAM!:\nLOOS = LOSO\nRENAME\nL006 = LOSO\nRENAH\nL007 = LOSO\nRENAME\nLOOB = LOSO\nREN AME\nL009 = LOSO\nRENA~E\nLOlO = LOSC\nRENAME\nLDll = LOSO\nRENAME\nL012 = LOSO\nRENAME\nL04S = LOSO\nREI\\AH L046\n= RETURN\nRENAME L047\nRETURN\nRENA~E LD48\n= RETURN\nRENAME LD49\n= RETURI\\\nRENAME LDSl\n= RETURN\nREI\\A~E\nTTLPGE = RETURN\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(XSE~l,GNFIST,TAPBIT,PAGE,PAGE1,PAGE2,PAGEZZZ)\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(BLKCATA(XSRTBD)I\nOVERLAY Al\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(MSGWRT, USRMSGI\nOVERLAY Al\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ ( er STRP I\nENDSYSZ,ENDSYS,BGNSYSI\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(\nINSERT ZENDSYS\nOVERLAY Al\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(BLKCATA(XSFAll,XCEl,XPOLCK,XFILPS)\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(XPURGEI\nINCL UDE NASTOBJ( XSAVE I\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(XPLECK,XPOLCKZ,XSFA,XCLEAl\\,XPUNP,XOPH,XSOSGNI\nINSE RT XSFAl,ZXPGLCK\nOVERLAY ESFA\nINSERT ESFA\nOVERLAY Al\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(BLKCATA(IFPXOl,BLKDATA(IFPXll,BLKDATA(U~FZZZ),SEMINTl\nINSERT IFPXO,XOLDPT,IFPXl,UMFZZZ\nOVERLAY DD\nINCLUDE I\\ASTOBJ( XRCARD\nOVERLAY D\nINCLUDE I\\ASTOBJ(GI\\FIAT,XCSA,XRGDFMl\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(XSBSETl\nOVERLAY El\nINSERT XCSABF\nOVERLAY El\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ(LCSOI\nOVERLAY D\nINCLUDE NASTOBJ (SORT, BLKOATA( IFP lAl, FNDPL Tl\nINCLUDE:.

McCormick\nThe MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\nThe experiences of The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation in NASTRAN installation and training are reviewed. Experiences in installation cover a wide\nvariety of computers and a number of different operating systems. Training\nperiods have varied from one or two days, directed at specific applications,\nup to two weeks or more covering both static and dynamic analysis.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation has participated in the installation\nand/or training in the use of NASTRAN for 35 different organizations. Included\nin the 1 ist of clients are seven NASA Centers, several aerospace organizations\nand other industrial users, primarily in turbine manufacturing and atomic power\nplant applications. Most of the clients own or lease their computers. However, several of the users have solved their problems on computers at commercial data centers. In these cases, access to the computer has been through the\nuse of computer terminal facilities located some distance from the central\nprocessor.\nNASTRAN has been operational at the CDC Cybernet Data Centers for several\nmonths. The data center operation makes NASTRAN available to many organizations\nthat would otherwise not be able to use the program. Since, in general\nNASTRAN runs more efficiently on large computers and larger computers provide\nmore computing power per dollar spent, it is usually much less costly to run\nproblems on large computers, particularly the larger problems. Although\nindividual users can rarely afford large computers, the data centers almost\nalways use the largest computers available in conjunction with multiprogramming\noperating systems. The design of NASTRAN permits the user to request only that\nfraction of the available hardware that is needed for his particular problem.\nIt is anticipated that the use of remote terminals and other data center\nservices wil 1 increase substantially as NASTRAN becomes more widely used. Data\ncenters can also serve as training centers for new NASTRAN users.\n\nNASTRAN INSTALLATION\nInstallation Procedures\nNASTRAN installation is defined as the transformation of a standard\nexecutable version of NASTRAN on a physical tape into an operating version for\nthe user at a particular installation. The following three general tasks are\nassociated with the installation operation:\nl.\n\nProvide direct access storage for the program.\n\n2.\n\nCheck NASTRAN interfaces with resident operating system.\n\n3.\n\nProvide operating system control cards for the user.\n\nSome form of direct access residence must be provided for the executable\nversion of NASTRAN. At some installations permanent space is provided on\neither disks or drums. In these cases, the first part of the installation\nmerely involves the transfer of the executable NASTRAN from tape to direct\naccess storage with the aid of the available operating system utilities. At\nother installations, permanent residence on direct access devices is not permitted. In these cases, the transfer of the executable NASTRAN from sequential\nto direct access storage must be performed for each execution. This transfer\nis a rather expensive operation, and for very small problems, may require as\nmuch computer time as the problem solution.\nA preliminary check on possible conflicts between NASTRAN and the resident\noperating system can be made by discussing this question with the programmer\nresponsible for maintaining the operating system at each installation. A final\ncheck is made by attempting to execute NASTRAN. These conflicts arise because\nof local variations in the standard operating systems. Fortunately, the number\nof interfaces between NASTRAN and the resident operating system isl imited to a\nfew well-defined areas. The interfaces that are most 1 ikely to give difficulty\nare associated with the dynamic use of main and secondary storage. One important interface is associated with the definition of the secondary storage files\nat the beginning of each NASTRAN execution. A related interface is associated\nwith the use of the secondary storage files for intermediate results during\nproblem solution. Another important interface is associated with the determination of the amount and location of main storage that has been assigned to\nNASTRAN by the resident operating system.\nThe operating system control cards are related to the definition of\nsecondary storage files, requested amount of secondary storage, and definition\nof input streams. In many cases the operating system control cards are defined\nin a procedure library and the user needs only to execute this procedure and\noverride any defaults that he wishes. Typical overrides are to request additional main storage and request physical tapes for one or more secondary\nstorage files.\n\n570\n\nDue to the limited use of the Univac EXEC 8 operating system outside of\nNASA centers, The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation has not had any experience\nwith variations in this operating system. There have been some discussions\nrelative to the modification of NASTRAN to run under the EXEC II operating\nsystem. However, this is a substantial task, and requires a number of modifications to the operating system, particularly the loader, and the development\nof new NASTRAN routines for transferring data between main and secondary\nstorage.\nIBM Installations\nThe MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation has used NASTRAN on the following\nmodels of the IBM 360/370 series: 50, 65, 75, 85, 91, 95, 155, and 195. Most\nof the operating systems have used the MVT (Multiprogramming with a Variable\nnumber of Tasks) job scheduler. A few of the smaller systems (models 50 and\n65) have used the MFT (Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks) job\nscheduler. Although the single-task environment (PCP) was used on a model 50\nduring the development of NASTRAN, this form of job scheduler has not been\nencountered recently.\nIn addition to the various job schedulers, a number of different job\nsupervisors have been encountered. These are operating systems that extend the\ncapability of the basic 0S/360 by control] ing one or more computers that in\nturn are using any one of the job schedulers - MVT, MFT, or PCP. The IBM\nreleased job supervisor is cal led the Attached Support Processor (ASP). A\nnumber of other local job supervisors have been encountered such as HASP, LASP,\nand a special triplex system.\nIn all of these experiences with IBM hardware and operating systems, only\nmodest difficulties have been encountered in the use of NASTRAN. Moreover,\nwhen difficulties have been encountered, the problem has usually been solved\nwith the use of control cards at execution time, rather than by making coding\nchanges in NASTRAN. Although there were some problems associated with early\nreleases of NASTRAN and 0S that required coding changes, no such difficulties\nhave been encountered recently.\nDirect access storage for the executable NASTRAN program is provided on\nthe 2314 disk storage device. Approximately one-third of a disk pack is\nrequired for the NASTRAN program. At some installations, space is provided on\npermanently mounted packs, whereas other installations use private packs that\nare mounted on request for each NASTRAN execution. The executable load module\nis copied from a magnetic tape to the disk pack using standard system utility\nprograms.\nDifferences in options that are used when a particular operating system is\ngenerated (SYSGEN) will affect the amount of space needed in the NASTRAN\nexecution region for operating system routines. For example, at one installation one of the operating system routines was marked nonree ntrant. Consequently, a fresh copy of the routine was loaded when any of the NASTRAN links\n(currently 13 in number) were loaded. Moreover, each new copy required\n\n571\n\nseparate main memory space for storage. If insufficient space is provided for\nsystem routines, the operating system will terminate the job with an error\nmessage (80A) indicating this fact. Additional space can be provided for\noperating system routines by changing the value of SYSTEM(31) on the NASTRAN\ncard at execution time.\nOne of the main tasks in adapting NASTRAN to a particular operating system\nand a particular hardware configuration is to design a procedure for the\nPR0CL I B to provide most of the necessary operating system control cards. The\nmajority of these cards are associated with the definition of the secondary\nstorage files. The buffer sizes for these files should be selected with due\nregard for the fact that larger buffers are more efficient, but requi\'re additional main memory space. The buffer size must not be greater than a single\ntrack on the 2314 disk pack, and for efficiency, an integral number of buffers\nshould fit on a single track of the disk storage device. The initial allocations should be adjusted to fit the average size problem contemplated, with\nprovision made for overrides at execution time for larger problems.\nCDC Installat i on\nThe MacNeal-Schwend l er Corporation has used NASTRAN on a number of\ndifferent CDC 6000 series machines using local variations of the SC0PE 3 operating system . The main diff i culties on these machines have been associated\nwith the XB00T routine and local variations in the operating system library\nroutines. The XB00T routine is the interface between the SC0PE loader and the\nNASTRAN loader. In many cases, minor modifications have been made to XB00T to\naccommodate local variations in the SC0PE operating system. Based on these\nexperiences, an executable version of NASTRAN can now be generated that will\nrun on all operating systems that have been encountered for CDC 6000 series\nmachines.\nThe NASTRAN executable program usually exists as a sequential file on\ntape. The first few records of the file contain an initial load program\nproduced by the special NASTRAN 1 inkage editor. The remainder of the file\ncontains the NASTRAN executable program produced by the NASTRAN linkage editor .\nThe NASTRAN program is initiated by executing an operating system control\nstatement that causes the CDC loader to load th e initial program and transfer\ncontrol to XB00T. The XB00T program reads the remainder of the file, writes it\non the disk in indexed form, reads the first part of the NASTRAN program into\nmain memory, and transfers control to NASTRAN.\n\xc2\xb7\nSome installations permit NASTRAN to remain on the disk in indexed form.\nIn these cases, the execution of NASTRAN only requires a control statement\npointing to the NASTRAN permanent file on the disk. At some of the CDC Data\nCenters, NASTRAN is kept in indexed form on mountable disk packs. In these\ncases, the user only needs to requ es t a disk pack mount in order to have\nNASTRAN available in direct access form.\n\n572\n\nAt the Langley Research Center, NASTRAN is resident on a data eel l. The\nuser requests the NASTRAN program by including a FETCH control statement in his\ndata deck. This statement causes NASTRAN to be fetched from the data cell and\nplaced on the disk in direct access form. Once NASTRAN is fetched it is\nallowed to remain in residence on the disk as long as the space is not needed\nfor other programs in execution. If NASTRAN is already in residence on the\ndisk, the operating system skips the fetch step and proceeds directly to the\nexecution of NASTRAN.\nSince only a few control cards are required to execute NASTRAN on the\nCDC 6000 series, no special catalog procedures are required. No control cards\nare needed to define the secondary storage files as these definitions are\nhandled internally by the NASTRAN executive system . The secondary storage\nspace is allocated by the operating system as needed during execution.\nOne of the troublesome variations in the SC0PE operating system is the\nmanner in which the main memory field length is adjusted during execution. In\nmany cases, a control card (RFL) is provided that permits the user to request\na field length of his choice. In other cases, the field length is reduced to\nthat needed for the first program loaded. This latter situation causes trouble\nbecause the dynamic use of main memory in NASTRAN does not permit the use of a\ndimension statement that includes the working space. Unless a control card\n(N0RFL) is provided to prevent this reduction, all main memory space beyond the\ncode in the initial load program is returned to the operating system, and\nNASTRAN is unable to continue beyond the execution of the initial program. If\nthe field length is reduced and a N0RFL control card is not present in the\noperating system, it is necessary to modify the initial load program in order\nto protect the main memory space.\nNASTRAN TRAINING\nUser Training\nUser training is herein defined as preparing a person already experienced\nin finite element modeling to use NASTRAN for the analysis of structures subjected to static and dynamic loads. Basic training sessions have usually\nextended over a period of one week. The usual format has been classroom\nsessions in the morning and problem solution sessions in the afternoon. The\nactual experience of preparing a NASTRAN data deck and submitting problems\nfor solution is an important part of the NASTRAN training. Shorter periods of\ntraining have been used, but most people find the more intensive training less\ndesirable, unless they are experienced in the use of other finite element\nprograms. In some cases, the basic training has extended over a two,-week\nperiod. In these cases, it has been found desirable to conduct two sessions\nof one week each, separated by a period of about two weeks.\nMany organizations find it desirable to supplement the basic training\nwith some form of continuing assistance . This additional help is usually\nsupplied on an on-call basis as needed for special problems. In some cases,\n\n573\n\nadvanced training courses of up to one week duration have been conducted,\ncovering such topics as techniques for the solution of very large problems and\nadditional training in the use of direct matrix abstraction procedures (DMAP).\nBasic training courses usually emphasize the use of rigid formats with little\nor no discussion of matrix abstraction programming. There will be a continuing need for modest amounts of additional training when new capabilities are\nadded to NASTRAN.\nMany users have learned to use NASTRAN without the benefit of formal\ntraining. In most cases, these people were already experienced users of other\nfinite element programs. Probably the biggest problem associated with selfhelp operations is the lack of a training manual. The User\'s Manual is organized as a reference manual, and as such it is difficult for untrained persons\nto use. Perhaps funds will someday be allocated for the preparation of a selfhelp training manual. It has even been suggested by some that a training movie\nwould b~ a useful vehicle for NASTRAN training.\nProgrammer Training\nProgrammer training has varied from a few hours to several days or even\nlonger when programmers have been given a complete working knowledge of\nNASTRAN. All programmer training has been conducted as on-the-job training,\nrather than formal classroom instruction. This approach has been found to be\nthe most effective as usually only one or at most a few programmers are\ninvolved at any one time.\nThe m1n1mum programmer training consists of a brief description of the\nNASTRAN program structure, along with instruction in the operation of NASTRAN\non a particular hardware configuration with a particular operating system.\nThis will include a discussion of the provision of direct access storage for\nthe executable version of NASTRAN, and the development of a set of operating\nsystem control cards along with a cataloged procedure if desirable. The\nprogrammer is also instructed in variations of the operating system control\ncards that are required for checkpointing, restarting, plotting, use of tapes\netc. Some instruction in the interpretation of NASTRAN error messages and\npossible difficulties with the particular operating system being used are\nincluded in the minimum programmer training. In open shop installations, the\nuser is frequently responsible for the operation of NASTRAN, and hence, in\nthese cases, the user is given the minimum programmer training.\nThe next level of programmer training is to learn the procedures for\nusing the source and object libraries to make changes in NASTRAN and link edit\na revised executable version. This level of training will permit the programmer to correct errors and make modifications to the program. Many installations will want to develop this operational capability in order to take advantage of known error corrections between standard C~SMIC releases of NASTRAN.\n\n574\n\nOnly a few inst~llations desire the highest level of programmer training.\nComplete training in the development of new NASTRAN code requires several weeks\nof on-the-job training. There is little need for this level of training unless\nan organization wishes to actively make contributions to the development of\nNASTRAN, either for their own use or as a contractor.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nExperiences gained in a wide variety of NASTRAN installations has made it\npossible to generate a single version of NASTRAN that will run on all known\nversions of a given operating system. User training of one week and programmer\ntraining of a few hours seems to be satisfactory for the usual NASTRAN operations. More extensive user training is required for the solution of large\nproblems and more extensive programmer training is required if one wishes to\ndo program development work with NASTRAN.\n\n575\n\nNASTRAN INSTALLATION:\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS\n\nAND POSSIBLE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED\nBy Howard E. Dielmann\nComputer Sciences Corporation\nSUMMARY\nNASTRAN, from its inception, was designed to operate on several\ndiverse computer systems.\nIt is currently installed and operating\non the CDC 6600, the IBM 360, and the UNIVAC 1108. This paper discusses the steps found by CSC to be necessary in installing NASTRAN\non a computer system and the possible obstacles that might be encountered in undertaking NASTRAN installation. Reference is made to\nactual problems that arose during installation on the above machines.\nWith a knowledge of what has happened to date in setting up NASTRAN,\nthe future user wi 11 be better able to cope with and understand the\nimplications of installing NASTRAN on his computer.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe NASTRAN program had as its primary directive to design and\ndevelop NASTRAN in such a manner that it could be easily implemented\non several different machines.\nThese machines were the IBM 7094\nunder IBSYS, the UNIVAC 1108 under EXEC II and EXEC 8, the IBM 360\nunder OS, and the CDC 6600 under SCOPE. The problems associated\nwith machine dependence were given considerable attention during\nthe initial phases of NASTRAN\'s development.\nAn attempt was made\nto utilize a subset of FORTRAN IV that was compatible with th~ specified machines (reference 1), and to - avoid dependencies on machine\ncharacteristics such as 36-bit words or 6-bit characters. Despite\nthe planning devoted to avoiding dependencies, many obstacles arose\nwhenever NASTRAN was implemented on a computer system. These obstacles generally occurred because of the enormous size of NASTRAN, 1\nits extreme and varied demands on the operating system, or the lack\nof capabilities of the particular operating system involved.\n\n1\n\nNASTRAN\n145,000\n900,000\nof over\n\nconsists of over 700 subroutines and comprises some\ncards. The compiled object code contains approximately\nwords, and the absolute or executable program consists\n1,800,000 words (IBM 360 statistics).\n\n577\n\nEarly in the development of NASTRAN, the hardware capabilities\nand to some extent, the software capabilities of the second generation IBM 7094 and UNIVAC 1108 EXEC II were taxed excessively, and\nNASTRAN evolved into a third generation system. The third generation systems are better equipped to meet NASTRAN\'s hardware requirements, but no operating system to date has been able to sufficiently\nsatisfy all of the software requirements of NASTRAN. These third\ngeneration operating systems are not designed to give to any one\napplication program the total resources that NASTRAN requires (core,\nfiles, etc.) without limiting the execution of NASTRAN or affecting\nthe operation of the computer system.\nThe intent of this paper is to identify both the steps and the\nobstacles that might be encountered in installing NASTRAN. The\nparticular problems encountered in adapting NASTRAN to other computer systems cannot, of course, be addressed by this paper, since\nthese will vary from one computer system to another.\nHowever, a general observation can be made that will apply to\nthe implementation of NASTRAN regardless of the particular computer\nsystem involved. The observation is this: that a comprehensive and\nflexible operating system greatly aids in the installation effort.\nMany of the obstacles we encountered in installing NASTRAN involved\nservices related to the operating system, such as library editing,\ncompiling, loading, and I/O control.\nIf the proper facilities\neither were not available, or were insufficient, programs had to\nbe written to provide these services. We therefore feel that the\nfollowing features of an operating system are either necessary or\ndesirable: (1) a source and object library editing capability,\n(2) a standard and efficient FORTRAN IV compiler, (3) a sophisticated loader capable of handling large overlays, (4) an extensive\ncontrol language that allows multiple file definitions, dump specifications, etc., and (5) macro-level I/O calls.\nThis paper is presented in the general order of the steps\nemployed in installing NASTRAN:\n1.\n\nHardware evaluation\n\n2.\n\nSoftware implementation\na.\n\nSource language creation\n\nb.\n\nFORTRAN compilation\n\nc.\n\nSource and object library updating\n\nd.\n\nMachine-dependent deck conversion\n\ne.\n\nAbsolute program creation\n\n578\n\nf.\n\nNASTRAN execution\n\ng.\n\nTailoring of NASTRAN to the computer system\nHARDWARE EVALUATION\n\nThe initial question to be resolved when considering the\ninstallation of NASTRAN on a computer system is whether the hardware configuration will support NASTRAN. The primary requirement\nof NASTRAN is a large amount of core. NASTRAN can operate on as\nlittle as 45K words of core (UNIVAC 1108), but problem solving\ncapability can be limited even with 65K words.2 For large problems,\nat least lOOK words should be available.\nThe second question is\nwhether sufficient auxiliary storage space is available.\n(This\nallocation can be provided through disk, drum, or other available\nstorage devices.) A minimum of 30 files must be defined, each\nrequiring a space allocation of SOK to SOOK words.3 As problem\nsize increases, so does the need for auxiliary storage.\nFor convenient operation, the hardware should be configured with at least\nfive tape drives available to NASTRAN.\nIf only a minimum hardware\nconfiguration is available, _NASTRAN will operate, but it will be\nlimited as to the size of a problem that it can solve.\nMoreover,\na problem run on a larger system will usually take considerably\nlonger to run on a smaller configuration, since insufficient core\nstorage may cause spill in matrix operations. Other hardware\nfeatures such as the number and speed of I/0 channels and the speed\nof the auxiliary storage devices will also affect the operating\nefficiency of NASTRAN.\nSOFTWARE\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nSource Language Creation\nWhen we began to code NASTRAN and create source decks, it soon\nbecame apparent that card decks were too bulky.\nIBM 7094 IBSYS provided a card to tape utility, and NASTRAN card image source tapes\nwere used.\nCompilations were made from the tape and the tape was\nupdated via a CSC-written update program as new or modified decks\nwere added.\n2 For example, a 45K system should be able to solve a 175-order\ncomplex eigenvalue problem; a 65K system, a 900-order problem;\nand a lOOK system, a 2,100-order problem.\n3 For example , a single 1 , 000 order double precision matrix that\nis 25 percent dense requires 500,000 words of storage.\n\n579\n\nWhen the first NASTRAN system was to be developed on the UNIVAC 1108\nEXEC II, a corresponding source tape was needed.\nA utility program\nto convert the IBM 7094 tape to UNIVAC 1108 EXEC II format was\nwritten.\nOnce converted, this tape was acceptable as input to the\nFORTRAN compiler.\nEventually, corresponding programs were written\nto provide input source tapes to the UNIVAC 1108 EXEC 8, the IBM 360,\nand the CDC 6600.\nThe first step in putting NASTRAN on a computer is to obtain\nor create a source tape that can be used as input to the sytem\'s\ncompiler.\nIn all likelihood, this will require creating a program\nthat converts a current UNIVAC 1108, IBM 360, or CDC 6600 source\ntape to the required format.\nHowever, some operating systems may\nalready have the capability to handle this task (the RCA SPECTRA 7,\nfor example, accepts IBM 360 tape) and eliminate this step.\nFORTRAN Compilation\nThe next step, and supposedly the easiest, is the compilation\nof all of the source language decks.\nSurprisingly, however, this\nstep has activated numerous problems in the past. This situation\nno doubt has been due to the large number of source decks (700 subroutines, 145,000 source statements) and the variety and complexity\nof the code involved; if any errors exist in the target computer\'s\nFORTRAN compiler, they usually show up while the NASTRAN subroutines\nare being compiled. These errors appear either as a compilation\nabort, extraneous error messages, or incorrectly generated object\ncode.\nIncorrect code may occur when optimization of the object\ncode is selected.\nIf this occurs, the use of optimization should\nbe avoided.\nIf other compiler errors are identified, they can\nusually be circumvented by rewriting the FORTRAN code.4\nAnother and potentially more serious problem relates to the\ndefinition of standard FORTRAN.\nCSC in attempting to avoid this\nproblem defined a subset of the ASA standard FORTRAN IV that was\nto be used.\nThis meant that certain features available under one\ncompiler could not be used unless those features were available on\nall compilers.\nAs a result, octal or hexadecimal data statement,\nfor example, could not be used. However, in spite of our efforts,\nit was impossible to define a subset that was compatible on the\n~DC 6600.\nThat system\'s compiler required a different format for\nnonstandard returns and did not allow multiple entry points.\n4 For example, it was found that EXEC 8 failed to compile properly\nwhen a deck with one entry point contained nonstandard returns. An\nadditional dummy entry point was inserted into decks having one\nentry point and nonstandard returns, and correct code was thereafter generated.\n\n580\n\nWhen it became necessary to implement NASTRAN on the CDC 6600, a\nprogram was written to convert the source decks to 6600 compiler\nformat.\nThis program, similar to the FORTRAN II to FORTRAN IV SIFT\nprogram, modifies the format of nonstandard returns and eliminates\nmultiple entry points.\nWith a strong background in working with FORTRAN, and with\ndata on the integrity of the FORTRAN compiler involved, the degree\nof difficulty in compiling NASTRAN can be measured.\nIf a given\ncompiler is known to have errors, it should be avoided - presuming,\nof course, that a choice of compilers is available.\nIf optimization\nhas caused problems in the past, it should not be used.\nIf the\nFORTRAN IV language differs from the standard that NASTRAN has used,\na SIFT-type program may have to be developed. Overall, however,\nwith a competent system, this task should be a purely mechanical\none, consisting of a string compilation of all decks.\nSource and Object Library Updating\nInherent in the compilation of source language decks is the\ncreation of an object library tape.\nIn order to maintain library\ntapes, a source and object library edit and update program is necessary.\nIn the case of the IBM 7094, a source and object library\nedit and update program did not exist, and such a program therefore had to be written. Although a third generation system generally has such a capability, the capability is sometimes cumbersome\nto use.\n(For example, the IBM 360 object tape has to be edited to\nprovide control section names for input to the Linkage Editor.)\nBy using library edit features, changes to source programs\ncan be made by simply specifying in an update deck the changes that\nare to be made to the library source program.\nWhen this deck is\ncompiled, the source and object libraries are automatically updated.\nA sophisticated library edit capability in a target system\ncan greatly facilitate compilation and subsequent updates to the\nsystem.\nDesirable features of an edit program include the following: (1) an update option for inserting, deleting, or adding cards,\n(2) the capability of allowing source and object libraries to be\nmaintained on random access devices, (3) the ability to automatically update the source and object libraries when a deck is recompiled, and (4) the capability of listing and identifying all decks\nby time and date compiled.\nMachine-Dependent Deck Conversion\nOnce the FORTRAN decks have been compiled, the machine-dependent\nprograms must be converted . These machine-dependent programs consist\nof several assembly language decks, some Data Block decks, and some\nFORTRAN decks.\n\nThrough a concerted effort, assembly language coding was kept\nto a minimum, since CSC considered it more important to provide\neasily convertible FORTRAN code than to obtain the increase in efficiency provided by assembly code. The few assembly language programs that do exist consist of function-type subroutines (AND, OR,\nLSHIFT, etc.) and operating system-type interface routines (CPU\nclock, time of day clock, console message, etc.). Of the assembly\nlanguage subroutines, some can be simply converted (i.e., AND, OR,\nLSHIFT), while others must be implemented according to the interface\nwith the system (i.e., reading the CPU clock). Generally, the operating system provides subroutines that return the time of day, that\nreturn the elapsed CPU time, and that send messages to the computer\noperator.\nUnder these circumstances, the only change required in\nthe NASTRAN decks is to code a routine that calls the system subroutine providing these capabilities.\nDuring NASTRAN\'s development, block data programs that contained system parameters were defined. These parameters include\nmachine characteristics, and various subroutines utilize this\ndata.\nIn installing NASTRAN, the system parameters must be modified to identify such characteristics as computer word size, number of bits per character, number of characters per word, timing\ninformation, etc.\nThe application subroutines utilize this inform~tion to accomplish such tasks as extracting a character from a\nword, based on the character and word length definitions contained\nin the data base.\nThe third set of decks that must be changed are the machinedependent FORTRAN decks. These decks generally handle some of the\nNASTRAN-operating system interfaces.\nOne of these decks is GINOIO,\nwhich contains the physical 1/0 calls to the system output devices.\nPreferably, GINOIO should contain macro-level 1/0 calls, but can\ncontain FORTRAN READ/WRITE calls, although such calls are extremely\ninefficient. A second deck that must be modified (and that may have\nto be in assembly language) is GNFIAT, which must identify and transmit to NASTRAN the number and name of all files allocated to the run.\nSeveral smaller decks that accomplish initialization and link switching must also be changed.\nTo accomplish the conversion of these machine-dependent programs usually requires persons knowledgeable in both the intricacies of NASTRAN and the internal aspects of the operating system.\nAbsolute Program Creation\nOne of the most difficult tasks required in installing NASTRAN\nis the creation of the overlays and the generation of the absolute\n(executable) elements, since no two loaders of third generation computers are even remotely similar.\nIn addition to this problem, most\nloaders are not equipped to handle an overlay as large or as complex\n\nas that of NASTRAN.\nFairly early in the development of NASTRAN,\nwe exceeded the capacity of the IBM 7094 loader, and subsequently\nexceeded a size limitation on the UNIVAC 1108 EXEC II due to fixed\ntable sizes.\nHowever, even the third generation loaders have not\nbeen well equipped to handle the NASTRAN overlay.\nNASTRAN is divided into 14 separate links, each with its own\noverlay tree structure. These links can be created independently\nand can be thought of as separate programs. Therefore, if a deck\nis changed in one link, only that link has to be regenerated. Communication between the links is handled via data contained on external storage. The EXEC 8 overlay loader handled the structuring of\neach link extremely well.\nOnly those decks that defined origins\nhad to be explicitly named, while all other subroutines were included\nautomatically.\nHowever, EXEC 8 failed in providing a convenient\nmechanism for crossing between links. This was eventually solved\nby using external control cards to determine the link to be executed,\ncalling the link in, and passing control to it. On the IBM 360, the\nlinking concept is entirely different and consists of a super link\noccupying a region of its own.\nThe functional links are loaded into\na second region, with the super link program responsible for passing\ncontrol between functional links.\nIn addition, the execution time loading characteristics between\nsystems differ. The UNIVAC 1108 has a segment loader, which causes\na segment of an overlay to be loaded only when the segment is explicitly called. The IBM 360, on the other hand, has a string loader,\nloading the segment called and all other segments between it and the\nmain link. This caused problems; a job might run for example, on\nthe IBM 360 but not the UNIVAC 1108 because the same segments were\nnot loaded into core at the same time.\nWhen we began the installation of NASTRAN on the CDC 6600, we\nencountered a loader with such limited capability that implementation was impossible.\nIt was therefore necessary to write a loader\nto handle NASTRAN\'s requirements.\nA loader was written for the\nCDC 6600 (primarily in FORTRAN), and was patterned after the IBM 360\nLinkage Editor/Loader.\nThe difficulty of establishing NASTRAN on a system depends on\nthe capabilities of the system loader.\nIf other large programs\nrequiring overlays have been implemented successfully on the target\ncomputer, then NASTRAN can probably be installed. As mentioned\nearlier, if the operating system has a sophisticated loader capable\nof handling large overlays, the problems connected with NASTRAN\ninstallation will be minimal.\nIf, however, the required loader\ncapabilities do not exist, a new loader may have to be written.\nSince most third generation systems possess competent loaders, however, the likelihood of having to write a new loader is not great.\n\nNASTRAN Execution\nOnce the absolute programs have all been created, NASTRAN is\nready for execution. The control stream for executing NASTRAN must\nnow be constructed by the user.\nNASTRAN requires a large number\nof separate I/0 files (more than 30) with a significant amount of\nperipheral storage allocated to each file.\nThese files are defined\nby means of the operating system\'s control language 5 . and are identified by FORTRAN logical unit numbers. 6\nThe operating system\'s control language js also used to specify\nthe location of absolute programs (i.e., if t h e y are catalogued on\npermanent storage) or to cause the programs to be read from tape.\nIf sufficient auxiliary storage is available, the NASTRAN absolutes\nshould remain resident, rather than be reloaded from tape for each\nrun. The control stream must also identify under what abnormal end\nconditions a dump is to be taken, what portions of main core storage\nare to be dumped, and with what format .\nThis, of course will not be the first time in implementing\nNASTRAN on the target computer that extensive use has been made of\nthe operating system\'s control language. Throughout the initial\nstages of NASTRAN generation, the compilations and library edits\nrequired the use of many control language features.\nFrom our experience, we found that a control language should be sophisticated\nenough to perform the necessary tasks, but not so detailed that it\nbecomes cumbersome to use and difficult to understand.\nTailoring of NASTRAN to the Computer System\nAt this point, NASTRAN should be operational on the target\ncomputer. However, the installation should not yet be considered\ncomplete.\nIdeally, NASTRAN should be tailored to the particular\ncomputer system. This customizing includes setting up standard\nprocedures to reduce the effort required to operate NASTRAN and\nextend its flexibility.\nMany things can be done to simplify the control stream required\nto execute NASTRAN. One of these, already mentioned, is to catalog the NASTRAN system on a permanent file that is available to all\nusers.\nAnother means might be to group the many control cards necessary to define the files into one data set that is callable by a\nsingle control card.\nIt may be possible to include in this call a\n5 For example, on the IBM 360 DD cards are used to define the unit\nnumber, physical device (tape, disk, etc.,) and space allocation.\n6 For example, the integers 8, 9, 10, 11, etc.\n\n584\n\nparameter that defines the space allocation.7 It may also be possible to specify a region size on the run card, and therefore to\nprovide a flexible NASTRAN system in terms of core and file size.\nBy implementing the above suggestions, it is likely that the number of control cards needed can be reduced to as few as four or five.\nSeveral changes can also be made to improve the run efficiency\nof NASTRAN. The NASTRAN buffer size can be tailored to fit the\nparticular random access devices used. That is, buffer size can be\nset to correspond to half-track or full-track.\nSince data buffers\nshould not cross track boundaries, such tailoring can improve the\nefficiency of the 1/0 and provide better utilization of auxiliary\nstorage.\nMachine timing characteristics such as internal arithmetic\nspeed and 1/0 speed are stored in the data base, and are used to\nmake logical decisions concerning the most efficient means of decomposing a matrix. Timing studies can be made to refine the data\nbase times and thus to enable the decomposition routines to make\nproper decisions.\nA longer range goal might include the conversion of some of\nthe time-critical FORTRAN routines to assembly language, since conversion of \xc2\xb7these routines can lead to a substantial savings in\nmachine time. Here, the 1/0 and PACK/UNPACK routines are good\ncandidates for conversion. Also, if macro-level 1/0 was not used\ninitially in GINOIO, it is well worth considering it at this point.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe user who intends to install NASTRAN on a computer should\nnow have a reasonable idea of the nature of the task before him.\nHe also has an outline of the necessary steps to install NASTRAN.\nHowever, each computer is unique, and the problems as well as the\nsolutions that he encounters in implementing NASTRAN may be distinctly different from those of the past.\nUsers about. to install NASTRAN can reduce the magnitude of\nthe installation effort if three resources are available: first, a\ncapable and well checked out operating system; second, a person\nknowledgeable in the use and internal workings of that system; and\nthird, a person experienced in the use and internal design of\nNASTRAN.\n\n7on the IBM 360, for example, a PROC was set up to define the DD\ncards. A parameter included in the PROC defines the space allocation for each file.\n\nREFERENCE\n1.

A general-purpose program like NASTRAN, however,\nis more difficult to evaluate in that it must also be tested for complex builtup structural analysis problems. This can be accomplished using known\nexperimental results or solutions from existing general-purpose programs\nlike FORMAT that have been extensively tested for a variety of structures.\nThe present paper evaluates current NASTRAN (Levels 8. 1. 0 and 11. 1. 0)\ndiscrete element models for semi-monocoque and monocoque structures using\ncomparative results from FORMAT, special-purpose programs, and closedform solutions. In particular, comparisons are provided for a multi-cell\nswept wing, a water bottle storage rack assembly on the Skylab vehicle, and\ntwo common structural shapes. The accuracy of the NASTRAN results are\nof primary interest, but the question of program efficiency also receives\nattention.\nGeneral-purpose code comparisons are made for semi-monocoque\nstructures using NAST RAN rigid formats one (statics) and three (normal\nmodes). In the case of the swept wing problem, only static results are available; however, these include both force method and displacement method\nsolutions by FORMAT. The Skylab storage rack problem is analyzed for\nstatic deflections and natural modes using a reduced dynamic model (Guyan\nreduction option) for the symmetric modes and the unreduced model for antisymmetric modes. The FORMAT solutions are obtained using the force\nmethod and a matrix condensation procedure equivalent to Guyan reduction.\nModeling differences between the force method and displacement method\nidealizations of the storage rack structure are described. Special-purpose\ncode comparisons are made for monocoque structures using NASTRAN rigid\nformats one (statics), three (normal modes), and nine (direct transient\nresponse). A simply supported cylinder under external pressure is analyzed\nusing the CQUADZ plate element. These results are compared with curved\nshell element solutions from the STACUSS and SLADE special-purpose codes.\nAn orthotropic elliptic plate loaded by an external pressure is also analyzed\nusing NASTRAN plate elements and the results compared with the Lekhnitskii\n\n588\n\nclosed-form solution. Comparisons are also made with a new parametric\ndiscrete element code. The final problem considered is the transient response\nof an impulsively loaded free ring segment. The structure is modeled using\nbeam elements and the response compared with results from the BOND and\nUNIVALVE ring codes. These data and data from the preceding problems\nprovide detailed information on the current modeling capability of NASTRAN\nfor monocoque and semi-monocoque structures.\n\nGENERAL-PURPOSE CODE COMPARISONS FOR\nSEMI-MONOCOQUE STRUCTURES\n\nGeneral-purpose discrete element programs are designed. primarily for\nthe analysis of complex built-up structures. Irregular construction and\ngeometry make it difficult, if not impossible, to analyze these structures by\nother methods and it was this capability in NASTRAN that was first to be\nevaluated at MDAC. A very large percentage of the total analysis cost for\nsuch structures is associated with development of the discrete element model\nfrom engineering drawings and a large percentage of this cost is associated\nwith the generation of grid coordinate data. NASTRAN has no built-in capability in this area although user coded modules can be added to provide a\nbasic capability such as that in FORMAT (see ref. 1, pp 91-92). Ideally the\ncomputer graphics used in the actual design (ref. 2) should be available to\naid in the construction of the analysis model.\nThe NAST RAN Level 11. 1. 0 results, compared. in this section with\nFORMAT-III results, were obtained on the CDC 6500 in double precision. The\nFORMAT-III results were obtained in single precision on the UNIVAC ll08 and\nthe CDC 6500. This difference in computational precision did not significantly\naffect the accuracy comparisons, although it did increase the NASTRAN central\nprocessor unit (CPU) times.\n\nSemi-monocoque Swept Wing\nThe swept wing problem is taken from the FORMAT User\'s Manual\n(ref. 1). and features many items common to built-up structure. These\nincluded. oblique reactions, thermal loading, skewed element geometry,\ntapered sections, and multiple materials. The wing (see fig. 1) has a O. 5236radian sweep angle, a multi-rib outer section, and a tapered root section.\nThe two sections have a gap between them and are connected by the front and\nrear spar caps. The discrete element idealization of the front spar has bending\nstiffness in two planes outboard of node 33 (see figs. 2 through 4). The\nstructure is basically aluminum with a number of steel stiffeners and is\nsubjected. to both mechanical and thermal load conditions. The NAST RAN and\nFORMAT displacement idealizations use similar elements although the element\nmatrices are slightly different.\nThe FORMAT force method model of the wing\nuses the same grid points but different plate and panel elements as described\nin reference 1. The fi rst load condition i s a 4 . 448 - Ne w ton lift fo r ce on the\nfront spar wing tip (see fig. 1, vector 37) and the second load condition is a\n\ntemperature increment of 111. 1 \xc2\xb0Kat nodes 5, 6, 7 and 8 (see fig. 2). Comparative results for the mechanical load condition (see figs. 5 through 9) show\ngood agreement with the largest differences occurring in the displacement\ndirectly under the load. The maximum displacement difference between\nNASTRAN and either FORMAT solution is 7 percent. The comparison of\ninternal bar forces is actually better, as figure 7 demonstrates, with the\nmaximum difference between NASTRAN and either FORMAT solution being\n3. 5 percent. Results from the thermal load condition (see figs. 10 through\n13} show smaller differences than for the mechanical load condition. The\ncomputational performance of NASTRAN Level 11. 1. 0 was significantly better\nthan that of FORMAT-III. The CDC 6500 NASTRAN solution for five load\nconditions required 171 CPU seconds, 3 64 PPU seconds, and 218 SS seconds.\nThe PPU time includes 200 seconds required to copy NASTRAN from tape to\ndisk which can be avoided by using permanent disk storage. This solution was\nin double precision, a waste of time and core on CDC 6000 series computers.\nThe single-precision FORMAT displacement solution required 1320 seconds\non the UNIVAC 1108 which executes FORMAT in very nearly the same time\nas the CDC 6500. The size of this problem is relatively small (N=232} and the\nmajority of the CPU time is not spent solving the equilibrium equations.\nNASTRAN used only 21 seconds and FORMAT 60 seconds. The principal\nreason for the computational difference in this problem is the use of a preprogrammed rigid format by NAST RAN.\n\nSkylab Storage Rack- -Statics\nThe Skylab vehicle has a water bottle storage rack assembly (see figs.\n14 and 15) consisting of 3 built-up frames, with 10 cylindrical water tanks\ndistributed around the circumference between the 2 lower frames, 25 storage\nracks distributed around the upper frame, and a conical skirt connecting\nthe assembly to the Skylab primary structure. The water containers hold\n3044 kg of water, the contents of the storage cabinets has a mass of 1361 kg\nand the total mass of the structure is 6976 kg.\nA NAST RAN idealization that uses one plane of symmetry was generated\nfor half the structure (see fig. 16) using an earlier FORMAT-III idealization\nwherever possible. Some modeling differences occurred because the\nFORMAT-III force method shear panel has mid-side nodes and the associated\nbar (rod} element has mid-length reactions, while the NASTRAN shear panels\nhave nodes at the corners. A summary of the FORMAT-III and NASTRAN\nidealization for half the structure is presented in table 1. Heavy use of bars\nand shear panels to represent bulkheads in the force method model is de signed\nto keep the number of redundants small. This situation does not occur in the\ndisplacement method and membrane elements were used in the NASTRAN\nidealization of the bulkheads. The most serious deviation from the FORMATIII modeling occurred in representing the conical skirt support for the storage\nrack assembly. The FORMAT-III idealization used direct input flexibility\nmatrices at the support reactions to represent the conical skirt while in the\nNASTRAN model the vertical and tangential displacements were prescribed to\nbe zero at the outer circumference of the lower ring frame. This modeling\ndifference could have been removed using the general element feature in\n\n590\n\nNAST RAN; however, this was not done for budgetary reasons.\nNASTRAN solutions for static unit loads were obtained and compared with\nexisting force method results obtained from the FORMAT-III program.\nFigure 17 indicates good agreement between FORMAT-III and NASTRAN\nLevel 11. 1. 0 for the upper ring frame and water container support structure,\nwhile at the lower ring frame the NASTRAN model is too stiff because of the\nmodeling of the supports. The lack of correlation with Level 8. 1. 0 of\nNASTRAN, shown in figure 17, is due to an error which occurs in this early\nrelease for a special class of multipoint constraint equations. The swept\nwing problem for example also used multipoint constraint equations but no\nsignificant differences in the Level 8. 1. 0 and Level 11. 1. 0 results were\nobserved. The computational performance of NASTRAN was again superior\nto FORMAT. The module times listed in table 2 indicate, surprisingly, that\nthe multipoint constraint eliminator took longer than decomposition of the\nstiffness matrix. These results were obtained after renumbering the grid\npoints using BANDIT (see ref. 3) to reduce the bandwidth of the stiffness\nmatrix. Prior to renumbering, the semi-bandwidth was 289 with 26 active\ncolumns and the problem 11 spilled 11 badly. Excessive data transfer (i.e.,\nspill) occurs on the CDC 6000 series when the sum squared of the semi-bandwidth and the number of active columns exceeds the working core storage\navailable. NASTRAN estimated over 5000 CPU seconds to decompose the\npoorly sequenced matrix and terminated the run on its time-to-go check. Only\n91. 3 CPU seconds were used by BANDIT to save over 5000 CPU seconds. In\ngeneral, bandwidth minimization will not always be the best strategy because\nof the active column feature; however, it is a good baseline strategy used\nof ten at MDAC.\n\nSkylab Storage Rack- - Vibration\nNASTRAN solutions for the natural vibration characteristics were also\nobtained and compared with those obtained from the FORMAT-III program.\nThe FORMAT-III model for structural and nonstructural mass consisted of\nconcentrated (lumped) masses for 250 dynamic degrees of freedom :i.n the\ncomplete structure. A matrix reduction. procedure similar to "Guyan reduction\' \' was used to condense the static discrete element model to these 250\ndegrees of freedom before computing vibration modes. The same mass\nidealization and dynamic degrees of freedom were used in the NASTRAN model\nexcept for the conical skirt modeling differences and the use of structural\nsymmetry in the NASTRAN model. This resulted in a 115 degree of freedom\nmodel after Guyan reduction, since some of the degrees of freedom at the\nsupports were restricted by the support conditions.\nThe NASTRAN results for the symmetric modes were computed for the\nreduced system using the Givens method. The lowest antisymmetric mode\nwas obtained by inverse iteration for the unreduced system, with the mass\nrestricted to 115 degrees of freedom, after applying antisymmetric boundary\nconditions at the plane of structural symmetry. The frequency comparisons\nbetween FORMAT-III and Level 11. 1. 0 given in table 3 for the first 10\nstructural modes, indicate that the NASTRAN results were consistently higher\nby from 3. 6 to 7. 8 percent which is in keeping with the too stiff boundary\n\n591\n\nconditions. The mode shapes for the complete FORMAT model were either\nsymmetric (modes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10) or antisymmetric to the precision of the\nprintout, which was seven significant digits. The mode shapes agree very\nwell away from the boundary (see figures 18 through 20) and in every case the\ndegree of freedom having the maximum displacement was the same.\nThe computational performance of NASTRAN was only average. The\nproblem used 40 minutes of CDC 6500 CPU time which is broken down for the\nmajor modules in table 4. The direct matrix reduction from 571 to 115 degrees\nof freedom required just under 20 minutes, which is not particularly efficient.\nIn this problem, the omitted coordinates have no mass so that reduction of the\nmass matrix is trivial. Apparently NASTRAN did not detect this situation.\nModule SMP 1 operates on both the stiffness and mass matrices simultaneously\nwhich can also cause inefficiencies on restart. Changes in mass data on a\nrestart run, for example, will cause the stiffness matrix to be reduced all\nover again. Another inefficiency in SMPl is the direct matrix reduction of\nthe m ass matrix. Sequential reduction such as that used in DYNAL (ref. 4)\nhas reduced problems from 600 to 105 degrees of freedom in under 5 minutes\nof equivalent CDC 6500 time. The computational performance of inverse\niteration (see table 4) on the unreduced problem could also be improved . A\nsignificant inefficiency in this routine is the use of an unsymmetric matrix\ndecomposition for symmetric matrices, This not only increases the number\nof computations; it reduces by nearly one-half the size problem that can be\nsolved without matrix spill. The vibration rigid format also ignores direct\nmatrix input data without printing a warning message. This is not only an\ninconvenience it can be dangerous.\n\nSPECIAL-PURPOSE CODE COMPARISONS FOR\nMONOCOQUESTRUCTURES\n\nSpecial-purpose codes usually are restricted to a particular geometry\nwhich they represent exactly. General-purpose codes, in contrast, often\napproximate curved structures as a series of initially straight discrete\nelements. As a result special-purpose codes tend to be not only faster but\nmore accurate for a given problem size. The analyst must weigh these\nadvantages against the disadvantage of having to learn the operating characteristics of several different programs and having to maintain them. Comparative\nresults are presented in this section that should assist the analyst in evaluating\nthe relative merits of NAST RAN for certain structural shapes. Thes e include\ncircular shells, elliptic plates, and curved beams.\n\nSimply Supported Cylinder\nST AC USS and SLADE are recently developed special-purpose codes\n(refs. 5 and 6) that can analyze shells of revolution with cutouts using general\ncurved shell discrete elements. At pre sent NAST RAN must model general\nshell structures using flat plate elements and it is important to have estimates\nof the loss in accuracy, hence efficiency, incurred using NAST RAN for these\n\n592\n\nstructures. To provide such data, a cylinder simply supported in w, with\nu=v=0 boundary conditions, is analyzed under a uniform pressure. The decay\nlength for boundary effects is approximately L/4 so that shell bending is\nimportant in the solution. Using axial symmetry, a 10-degree strip of 10\ncurved elements model the structure in ST ACUSS and SLADE, while a double\nstrip of 20 elements (20 degrees) is needed by NASTRAN to model the curvature\neffects. In general the number of elements can be the same, even for\nsymmetry models. The STACUSS elements have the same number of degrees\nof freedom per node as the NAST RAN elements while the SLADE element has\n16 additional u, v displacement degrees of freedom. This allows the influence\nof curved elements and high order elements to be separated. Results for\nmeridional moment, meridional displacement, . and normal displacement (see\ntable 5) indicate that curved shell elements can improve the maximum moment\nprediction by 16 percent, the maximum meridional displacement by 10 percent,\nand the maximum normal displacement by 3 percent. These percentages are\nbased on a reference shell-of-revolution discrete element solution using 50\nelements over the length of the cylinder. The well-known Timoshenko solution has different u boundary conditions. The STACUSS and SLADE results\nagree very well indicating that higher order u, v displacement functions are\nnot needed in this problem, If the applied load had a meridional or circumferential component, this conclusion rn,ight well change. The NASTRAN and\nSLADE solutions were obtained on the CDC 6500 and required 97 and 45 CPU\nseconds, respectively. The STACUSS solution was obtained on the IBM 360/65\nand required 79 CPU seconds. In all cases the majority of the CPU time was\nspent generating the matrices for the problem. The time spent solving\nequilibrium equations was very small. Recalling that the NASTRAN model\nused twice as many elements as the SLADE or ST AC USS models, the re will be\nlittle computational difference, in general, even though there is an accuracy\ndifference for the same grid. To summarize, the NASTRAN comparisons\ndemonstrate that flat plate elements can yield static shell solutions with\nreasonable accuracy but available curved shell elements offer a significant\nimprovement.\n\nOrthotropic Elliptic Plate\nTriangular and quadrilateral plate elements do not model the geometry\nefficiently in many plate problems. A simple example is a circular plate, or\na plate with a circular hole, where a straight-sided bending element models\nthe deformed geometry better than the undeformed. Discrete elements with\nvariable edge geometry, called parametric or isoparametric elements, can\nimprove solution accuracy for these problems in much the same way as curved\nshell elements improved the cylinder results. To estimate the potential\nimprovement, an orthotropic elliptic plate was analyzed using NASTRAN and\na parametric element code developed at MDAC. The plate is simply supported\na nd loaded by a uniform pressure of 36. 895 N/m 2 . A closed-form solution for\nthis problem is available (see ref. 7) to establish accuracy. Comparative\nresults between stra ight - sided NASTRAN elements and curved edge parametric\nelements are presented in table 6 for several grid refinements. The NASTRA\nresults for the 4x4 grid (see fig. 21) have converged to within 8 percent of the\nmaximum displacement and 12 percent of the maximum stress. (The centerpoint element stresses were interpolated and extrapolated to obtain the grid\n\n593\n\npoint stresses.) The parametric element results for the 2x2 grid have converged to within 5 percent of the maximum displacement and 6 percent of the\nmaximum stress. These data demonstrate that straight-sided elements can\nrequire over four times as many variables for similar accuracy. The\nNASTRAN 4x4 grid solution also required more CPU time than any of the\nparametric element solutions. As with the curved shell element comparisons,\nthe NAST RAN results are of acceptable accuracy but the curved-edge plate\nelement results offer a significant improvement.\n\nDynamic Response of Curved Beam\nThe planar response of an impulsively loaded, free ring segment having\na 0. 8238 radian arc was computed using rigid format nine of NASTRAN. TF.te\nring segment had an outside radius of 12. 7 cm, a thickness of 1. 016 cm, and\na width of 2. 54 cm, a Young 1 s modulus of 2. 068 x 10 4 N/m2 and a density of\n1. 64 gm/cm3 with an initial velocity of 4. 79 m/sec. One-half the beam was\nmodeled using 12 straight beam segments with the coupled mass formulation\nand no transverse shear. The linear elastic results for bending moment and\naxial force at the centerline were compared with solutions obtained from the\nMDAC BOND code (ref. 8) and the UNIVALVE code (ref. 9).\nThe BOND code is based on the general numerical method outlined in\nreference 10, and uses a lumped-parameter, spring-mass model to determine the dynamic elastic plastic response of soft-bonded layered rings. Only\nthe linear elastic option is used for the present problem. A semicircular\nsegment was modeled using 120 lumped masses in two rings connected by\nradial and tangential springs. To model the arc segment, all masses located\nin the outer ring and those in the inner ring beyond the actual arc segment\nwere prescribed to be very small. The actual model for half the circular arc\nsegment was thus represented by 8 of the 120 lumped masses. The BOND\nresults are for a location 0, 02618 radian from the centerline.\nThe UNIVALVE code computes the two-dimensional, large deflection\nresponse of arbitrary planar beams and rings using finite differences in space\nand time. The material may be elastic -plastic and exhibit strain hardening\nand rate sensitivity; however, these were not used in the present problem.\nThe ring was modeled using both 12 and 24 mesh points along half the curved\nring segment, and the results from the 12 point model were compared with\nNASTRAN.\nA comparison of the axial force at the centerline (fig. 22) shows good\nagreement for all three analyses. A comparison of the centerline bending\nmoment (fig. 23) indicates that the NAST RAN peak moment is 17 percent\nhigher than the UNIVALVE solution, although there was good correlation in\nfrequency. The NASTRAN peak moment was 5 percent greater than the BOND\nresult, which had a slightly higher frequency. The use of a lumped mass\nidealization resulted in a 7 percent reduction in the NASTRAN peak moment\nwhich occurs at 45 \xc2\xb5sec.\n\nWhen a low transverse shear modulus of 2. 068 x 103 N /m2 was introduced, the NASTRAN results agreed closely with the UNIVALVE results.\nTable 7 lists the maximum force for the first 100 \xc2\xb5sec, and summarizes the\nnumerical integration run times. It is noted that the NASTRAN program\nemploys an implicit integration scheme, while the BOND and UNIVALVE\nsolutions employ an explicit scheme. In addition the number of degrees of\nfreedom and time steps varied for the different solutions, which makes a\nmeaningful comparison of solution times difficult.\nThe NASTRAN solution was run on the CDC 6500 with the transient\nresponse module TRD requiring 259 seconds to execute 500 time steps for the\n37 degree of freedom model. The solution was obtained using a 1-\xc2\xb5sec time\nstep with the results printed out every fifth step. There was little change in\nthe solution when the step size was reduced to O. 5 \xc2\xb5sec.\nThe UNIVALVE program determines a mesh size for the time variable\nbased on the mesh size for the space variable. A separate run was made with\ndouble the number of mesh points, with the solution changing by about 1\npercent. A large number of time steps were required for the BOND program\nto insure solution stability. In summary, the NASTRAN results are of\nacceptable accuracy but the solution time is excessive in comparison to\nUNIVALVE. The time required by the transient response module in NASTRAN\nwas only 26 percent of the time shown in table 7. This means implicit versus\nexplicit integration was not the principal reason for the longer NAST RAN run\ntime.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe general elements in NASTRAN, Level 11. 1. 0, were found to adequately model semi-monocoque and monocoque structures for linear static and\ndynamic analyses. However, the modeling efficiency of NAST RAN can be\nsignificantly improved with the addition of general curved shell elements and\nvariable -geometry parametric discrete elements. This change should include\nmodification of the matrix assembly modules to eliminate the present six\ndegree of freedom per grid point restriction. These conclusions are based on\ncomparisons with both force method and displacement method solutions using\na variety of discrete elements. The early NASTRAN release, Level 8. 1. 0,\nwas found to have a serious error in the multipoint constraint eliminator that\nis not present in Level 11. 1. O. This error caused an erroneous solution of a\nSkylab component test case.\nThe computational performance of the static analysis rigid format was\nsuperior to FORMAT-III; however, NAST RAN Level 11. 1. 0 has no substructuring capability, The sparse matrix routines and the restart monitor\nperformed well although multiple restarts occasionally produced missing\nfiles. The structural plot module is easy to use but needs a larger character\nset to make the title legible. The vibration rigid format, by comparison, was\nrelatively inefficient, especially the Guyan reduction portion. The direct\ntransient response rigid format was also relatively slow. In part, this is the\n\n595\n\nresult of using double precision on the CDC 6500. A single precision option is\ndefinitely needed for CDC 6000 series computers. In conclusion, it should be\nnoted that NASTRAN contains many features not reviewed in this paper.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors are indebted to several colleagues at MDAC for providing the\nFORMAT and BOND results and to the Kaman Nuclear Corporation for providing the UNIVALVE results.

Levy\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nS. Wall\nComputer Sciences Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn large-capacity computer programs for structural analysis , computational efficiency is improved and core storage requirements are reduced by\ntaking advantage of the typical sparseness in the stiffness matrix. In the past,\nthe goal of reordering has been to minimize stiffness matrix bandwidth. An\nalternative reordering procedure has the goal of reducing matrix wavefront.\nWhen applied to the NASTRAN Program, this is equivalent to the reduction of\nthe number of active columns for zero bandwidth. Comparisons are supplied\nthat show the relative compactness that can be achieved for practical structural models with wavefront sequencing and with bandwidth sequencing.\nExamples show that wavefront sequencing can produce savings in the time\nrequired for subsequent decomposition of the stiffness matrix.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLarge-capacity computer programs for structural analysis operate most\nefficiently when the computational procedure is formulated to capitalize on the\ntypical sparseness of the structural stiffness matrix. Sparseness is used to\nadvantage by confining the computational operations to a compact region that\nis densely populated with nonzero coefficients and by omitting operations for\nthe empty region in which the coefficients are zero. Consequently, it is often\ndesirable to reorder a given stiffness matrix to make the region for computations as compact as possible and to make the empty region as large as possible. Traditionally, the compactness of the stiffness matrix has been measured by the matrix bandwidth, but an alternative equation- solving approach\n(ref. I) performs the computations within the region delineated by the matrix\nwavefront. The wavefront approach is attractive because the maximum\n\n*This\n\npaper presents the results of one phase of re search carried out at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\nContract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.\n\n627\n\nwavefront is often considerably less than the maximum bandwidth, and it can\nnever be greater.\nEfficiency and storage requirements of the NASTRAN stiffness matrix\ndecomposition procedure depend upon both the bandwidth size and the number\nof active columns. Wavefront and active columns are related because the\nnumber of active columns is equal to the wavefront reduced by the number of\ncolumns within the bandwidth; when the bandwidth is zero, the wavefront\nequals the number of active columns. However, in NASTRAN the emphasis\nfor efficiency is directed towards bandwidth processing rather than active\ncolumn processing. Consequently, preprocessor programs have been used in\nthe past to generate sequence cards that reduce the bandwidth of large-order\nstiffness matrices independently of possible reductions in active columns.\nNevertheless, it will be shown subsequently that practical difficulties in obtaining NAST RAN solutions for structures that have been bandwidth- sequenced\ncan sometimes be overcome by wavefront sequencing to reduce the number of\nactive columns with no regard for bandwidth.\n\nCOMPARISONS OF BANDWIDTH AND WAVEFRONT SEQUENCING\n\nAlgorithms described in references 2, 3, and 4 have been designed to\nreorder nodes for bandwidth reduction. More recently, wavefront reduction\napproaches have been given in references 5 -and 6. Resequencing procedures,\neither for bandwidth or wavefront reduction, \xc2\xb7.do\xc2\xb7 not ensure achievement of the\noptimal sequence. Results can be conside.red acceptable if there is an improvement from an initial sequencing in . a local optimum sense rather than\nconvergence to an absolute minimum in a global sense. For this reason, it is\nsometimes useful to perform resequencing several times, with each cycle\nstarting from a different initial sequence. This provides the opportunity of\nselecting the most favorable of the several local minimums that will be developed from the various cycles.\nIn one test of wavefront resequencing for an analytical model with about\n500 nodes, the initial sequencing had been developed by inspection and study of\nthe connectivity. The maximum wavefront was 43. One resequencing computer cycle reduced the initial maximum wavefront to 30. In another test, the\ninitial sequencing was scrambled at random, which produced a maximum\nwavefront of 92. One computer cycle reduced this to 40. Subsequently, as the\nresult of the best of six additional computer cycles, the maximum wavefront\nwas reduced to 27. In these, the starting node for each cycle was chosen at\nrandom.\nTable 1 shows comparisons of resequencing tests to reduce either wavefront or bandwidth. These tests we re performed for the analytical models of\nstructural components used in ground- based radar antenna systems. The\ntable shows that, after sequencing, the wavefront tends to be less than half the\nbandwidth, which can provide computational advantages in subsequent analysis.\n\n628\n\nDECOMPOSITION TIME COMPARISONS\n\nWe first used wavefront sequencing in NASTRAN when an eigenvalue solution was unable to proceed because of insufficient core. The problem contained 1300 unconstrained degrees of freedom and had been originally sequenced for bandwidth reduction. To process one column of the stiffness\nmatrix for NASTRAN decomposition, the minimum core storage requirements\nconsidering only the predominant terms are given approximately by the following relations:\n\nss\nSU = 3 \xc2\xb7 C \xc2\xb7 B + C\n\n2\n\nwhere\nSS is the storage for symmetrical decomposition (statics solution)\nSU is the storage for unsymmetrical decomposition (eigenvalue solution)\nB is the _bandwidth\nC 1s the number of active columns\n\nThe initial approach to find a remedy w as to experiment with changes in\nthe NASTRAN algorithm that attempts to allocate a favorable combination of B\nand C to be used for the decomposition. From this, the best result would have\nallowed a solution to proceed with B = 135 and C = 35, with 60 min as the\nestimated decomposition time.\nHowever, before attempting the solution, we noticed the strong dependence\nof the formula for unsymmetrical decomposition upon the product of active\ncolumns and bandwidth. Therefore, an alternative remedy to reduce storage\nwas to reduce this product term by forcing the bandwidth to be small while\nincreasing the number of active columns. The objective was to produce a net\ndecrease in the SU storage and to permit more efficient processing by allowing\nmore of the matrix to remain in core, eliminating some of the expensive outof-core spilling. Consequently, the problem was resequenced for wavefront\nreduction, le ading to a successful execution with a bandwidth of 3 and 102\nactive columns. The actual decomposition time was less than 11 min.\nTable 2 contains a summary of a few cases where the NASTRAN decomposition times have been determined for alternative types of sequencing. The\nstatics problems show about 20% savings for wavefront sequencing; the eigenvalue problem saving is considerably greater.\n\n629\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nExamples sho w savings in the NASTRAN decomposition times w hen use is\nmade of wavefront sequencing, which reduces the number of active columns,\nrather than sequencing which reduces the bandwidth. It appears that the relative inefficiency in processing active columns by NASTRAN compared with\nprocessing bandwidth columns is more than offset by the relatively smaller\nnumbers of active columns that can be achieved by sequencing.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nMelosh, R.

Hurwitz and Michael E. Golden\nNaval .Ship Research and Develop~ent Center\n\nABSTRACT\nA major concern of NASTRAN users is the lack of sophisticated\nelements in the NASTRAN element library. Adding a structural element to\nNASTRAN requires detailed familiarity with various parts of the program.\nThis paper describes a NASTRAN preprocessor, a new element definition\ncapability, which an analyst may use to generate the NASTRAN tables and\nroutines required for a new element. This preprocessor is written in the\nstring-manipulation language SNOBOL.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAlthough NASTRAN\'s system design is quite good, its present library\nof finite elements leaves something to be desired. The NASTRAN System\nManagement Office here at Langley has taken steps to greatly improve the\nlibrary of elements, but it would be very advantageous for an analyst to\nuse his own special or experimental element in NASTRAN. However, implementing his element into NASTRAN is a task the analyst may not wish to\nundertake, since it requires detailed familiarity with NASTRAN internal\nstructure, such as its variables, tables, routines, structure, and\nrestrictions.\nTherefore, we have written a NASTRAN preprocessor, a new element\ndefinition capability, with which an analyst may implement his own element\ninto NASTRAN relatively easily. This preprocessor will take the user\'s\ninput, given in symbolic form, and will generate the FORTRAN subroutines\nand BLOCK DATA subprograms which NASTRAN requires to use the new element.\nThe preprocessor is written in the SNOBOL language and is, therefore, a\nSNOBOL program which generates FORTRAN routines. After the analyst inserts\nthese generated routines into NASTRAN, the new element is ready for use.\n\n633\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREPROCESSOR\nPresently, the preprocessor is set up so that a new element may\nuse the entire NASTRAN capability except the Differential Stiffness\nand Piecewise Linear Analysis Rigid Formats.\nThe input to the preprocessor is divided into sections which we\ncall packets. The presently available data packets are\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPreliminary Data Packet\nGlobal Variable Packet\nStiffness Matrix Packet\nMass Matrix Packet\nViscous Damping Matrix Packet\nThermal Loading Vector Packet\nStress Matrix Packet\nStress and Force Calculation Packet\nOutput Packet\n\nEach packet except the Preliminary Data, Global Variable, and\nOutput packets will cause the preprocessor to generate a FORTRAN\nsubroutine which will calculate the appropriate quantity for the new\nelement. For example, the user will specify in the Stiffness Matrix\nPacket, through matrix and scalar expressions, the method by which the\nstiffness matrix for his element should be calculated. The preprocessor\nwill then generate the subroutine, conforming to NASTRAN\'s rules and\nrestrictions, to perform these calculations. Naturally, if a particular\nquantity is not needed for the new element (a viscous damping matrix or\nthermal loading vector, for example), the packet corresponding to that\nquantity need not be specified.\nThe Global Variable Packet contains definitions of variables which\nmay be used in several subsequent packets. The Preliminary Data and\nOutput packets will cause the preprocessor to generate BLOCK DATA subprograms which contain updates to present NASTRAN tables.\nTwo examples will provide some idea of the capabilities of the\npreprocessor. If we wish to define the vector v\nas follows:\n12\n\n=\n\nthen the preprocessor statement\nVl2, 3, 1, TERM\nindicates that\n\nv12 is a 3xl matrix and is to be defined term-by-term.\n\nThe statements\nVl2\nl,l,X2-Xl\n2,l,Y2-Yl\n3,l,Z2-Zl\nprovide the actual definition for Vl2. (Of course, Xl,Yl,Zl,X2,Y2, and\nZ2 had to be defined previously. These variables could have been defined\nby the user, or they could be some of the many variables predefined by\neither the preprocessor or NASTRAN.)\nAs a second example, we might wish to define the matrix\nC =\n\nC by\n\nATB\n\nwhere\n\nAT is the transpose of a previously defined matrix A, and\nB\nis a previously defined matrix.\nIf A is a 2x3 matrix and if B is also a 2x3 matrix, then the following\ntwo sets of statements wi ll define C.\nC, 3, 3, EQUA\nand\n\nNotice, then, that matrix as well as scalar operations are recognized\nby the preprocessor.\n\nSAMPLE PROBLEM\nAs a sample problem we prepared the input required by the preprocessor to produce routines corresponding to the triangular membrane\nelement presently in NASTRAN. All packets listed previously, except the\nViscous Damping Matrix Packet, were used. All the FORTRAN subroutines\nand BLOCK DATA subprograms were generated in 11 minutes (CPU) on the\nCDC 6400 central processing unit of the CDC 6700 computer. Preliminary\nresults indicate that the computer-generated routines are nearly as fast\n\n635\n\nas the handwritten routines. We expect more extensive comparisons,\nas well as more efficient routines, to be available later.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe feel that the new element definition capability described in\nthis paper is a good vehicle for augmenting NASTRAN\'s element library\nrelatively easily . With it, the analyst need not involve himself with\nNASTRAN\'s internal structure, and yet he will have the NASTRAN\nsystem capability available for his own element. Work is continuing to\nproduce a more efficient program, to produce more efficient gene rat ed\nroutines, and to increase the preprocessor\'s capabi lity.\n\nVIBRATION STUDIES OF A FLAT PLATE AND A BUILT-UP WING\nBy James H. Starnes, Jr.\nNASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\n\nThe natural vibration frequencies of a clamped flat plate and a built-up\nwing were computed by two different finite element computer programs and\ncompared with existing experimental data. The results of this study indicate\nthat by using a finite element program it is possible to obtain the accuracy\ndesired for parametric design studies even for complex built-up structures.\nHowever, the differences in central processing unit execution times between\nthe two programs revealed that it is economically feasible to develop automated\ndesign procedures or make parametric design studies involving many iterations\nonly if computer programs tailored for very efficient operation are available.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the flutter analysis of aircraft wings, it is standard practice to use\nthe natural vibration modes and frequencies as input data to aeroelasticity\nprograms which determine a wing\'s flutter characteristics. As a result of the\nrecent development of large finite element structural analysis computer programs,\nrealistic complex wing structures can now be readily analyzed to obtain such\ndata. However, in the development of automated design procedures involving many\ngeometric and structural iterations during preliminary design, it is necessary\nthat the finite element program used to provide the natural modes and frequencies\nnot use excessive computer time and hence make the whole concept of automated\ndesign prohibitively expensive. To determine the feasibility of using existing\nprograms as the analysis tools in automated design studies, finite element\nmodels of two representative structures were \xc2\xb7formulated and the first few\nnatural frequencies of these structures were determined by the use of the NASA\nStructural Analysis (NASTRAN) finite element program summarized in reference 1.\nAs the number of dynamic degrees of freedom and the complexity of the structure\nincreased it was found that the central processing unit (CPU) execution times\nbecame prohibitively large for making parametric studies. Therefore, it was\ndecided to determine if there was an available finite element program that could\ncompute the natural frequencies of the structures in significantly shorter CPU\ntimes and, consequently, make parametric design studies economically feasible.\nOne logical candidate program was the dynamics version of the Structural\nNetwork Analysis (SNAP) finite element program (ref. 2), which was specifically\ntailored for very efficient operation. This version of SNAP has recently\nbecome available, and uses different programing techniques and solution\nstrategies than NASTRAN.\n\n637\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare natural frequencies and CPU times\nfor SNAP and NASTRAN for a clamped flat plate and a free-free built-up wing.\nSince SNAP is not operational at the Langley Research Center at present,\nW. D. Whetstone of the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Huntsville, Alabama,\nprovided the SNAP solutions by the use of Lockheed Hrmtsville\'s Univac 1108\nExec 8 computer system. The NASTRAN solutions were obtained from the Langley\nResearch Center CIC 6600 computer system. The calculated results from the\ntwo computer programs were also compared with experimental results for the\ntwo types of structures.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE MODELS\nThe models selected for this study represented two characteristic wing type\nstructures. A simple t wo-dimensional topology and a straightforward dynamics\nproblem are represented by a clamped flat plate. As an example of such a model,\nthe 8.64 mm thick 45\xc2\xb0 delta magnesium plate with a 15.24 cm root chord studied\nexperimentally in reference 3 was described by two grid point networks which\nwere numbered to give the minimum bandwidth for the matrices associated with\nthe finite element problem. The first network had 10 spanwise and 10 chordwise\nelements (10 by 10), and the second had 30 spanwise and 30 chordwise elements\n(30 by 30) as shown in figure 1. The structural elements were modeled with the\ncombination bending and membrane plate elements of NASTRAN (CQUAD2 and CTRIA2)\nand the corresponding elements of SNAP. Although the structural model is simple\nenough conceptually, the dynamics problem becomes more demanding as the number\nof grid points increa ses . For t he 10 by 10 network t he model ha s 66 grid points\nand 165 dynamic degrees of freedom, while for the 30 by 30 network there are\n496 grid points and 1395 dynamic degrees of freedom.\nThe second model selected for analysis was the free-free built-up wing\nstudied experimentally in reference 4. This model represents a more complex\ntopology than the flat plate, is representative of a realistic aircraft wing\nstructure, and has the additional dynamic phenomenon of rigid body modes.\nThe wing was manufactured to close tolerances and each component was carefully\nweighed and measured. It is felt that an accurate enough definition of this\nwing\'s geometry and mass distribution existed to establish this model as an\nacceptable standard for comparison with analytical results. A photograph of\nthe final fabricated wing is shown in figure 2, and the details of the wing\nconstruction are shown in figure 3, This wing consists of ribs, spars, caps,\ncover panels, and external spanwise stringers. All components of the wing were\nmade from 2024 aluminum alloy. The grid point network used to model the right\nhalf of the wing was selected so that the four node cover panel elements would\nbe square, as shown in figure 4. The grid point network was numbered to provide\nminimum bandwidth matrices for the finite element problem. The finite element\nmodel used for the NASTRAN analysis consisted of membrane elements for the\ncover panels (CQDMEM and CTRMEM); shear panel elements for the ribs and spars\n(CSHEAR); and rod elements (CROD) for rib and spar caps, the external spanwise\nstringers, and the intersections of the ribs and spars. The corresponding\nelements were used for the SNAP model, however, it should be noted that there\nare some differences in the formulation of the membrane and shear finite\n\nelements used in the two programs. The nonstructural masses (rivet heads) were\napplied to the rod elements. For the convenience of input preparation, two\nexternal spanwise stringers were lumped at each of the two spanwise grid lines\nbetween the spars. Also, the two ribs located 35.6 cm and 4o.6 cm from the\nroot chord (fig. 3) were lumped at 4o.6 cm from the root chord. While the\nmodel did vary slightly from the actual wing geometry, the masses of the actual\nwing and the model were virtually the same (92.66 kg vs 92.92 kg). In an\nattempt to reduce the CPU execution times for the NASTRAN solution, the top and\nbottom grid points were tied together by multipoint constraints (MPC\'s) so that\nthe depth distribution remained constant for the resulting wing. The NASTRAN\nmodel has 234 grid points, but because of the MPC\'s and constraints on the\nin-plane degrees of freedom introduced with OMIT cards it only had ll 7 ~.ynamic\ndegrees of freedom. The SNAP model was not constrained to have a depth distribution which remained constant and did have in-plane degrees of freedom.\nTherefore, the SNAP model had 650 dynamic degrees of freedom for its 234 grid\npoints. Advantage was not taken of midplane symmetry in the SNAP model; if\nit had been, only 325 dynamic degrees of freedom would have been required.\nDISCUSSION OF THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS\nThe finite element programs used in this study are based on different\nsolution strategies and programing techniques. NASTRAN (refs. 5 and 6) is\nbased on matrix solution techniques which are dependent upon matrix bandwidth\nand active matrix columns . It performs its matrix operations such as assembling\ninitial matrices, applying multiple and single point constraints, and matrix\ndecomposition in a sequential fashion, while storing data on peripheral equipment between each step. The desired natural frequencies for this study were\ndetermined by using NASTRAN\'s Inverse Power Method with Shifts option. The\nNASTRAN solutions were obtained by the use of the Langley Research Center COC\n6600 computer system using NASTRAN Level 11.1.2, a version of NASTRAN which has\nsome CDC 6600 single precision operations.\nSN.AP is based on sparse matrix solution techniques and uses programing\ntechniques which minimize secondary data storage requirements (refs. 7 and 8).\nThe desired natural frequencies were determined by a matrix iteration technique which sweeps out the lower modes. The SN.AP solutions were obtained from\nthe Univac llo8 Exec 8 computer system at the Lockheed Missiles and Space\nCompany, Huntsville, Alabama,by the use of the SNAP Dynamic Analysis Version\nV70E (ref. 2) which allows Univac 1108 double precision operations.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nThe results of the analyses and experiments for the clamped 45\xc2\xb0 flat\nplate are presented in Table I which gives the natural frequencies, degrees\nof freedom, and the CPU times for the computer solutions. Based on these\nresults it is possible to compare the first three natural vibration frequencies\nof the plate and the amount of CPU execution time required by each computer\n\n639\n\nprogram. The maximum difference (approximately l.l percent) between the\ncorresponding computed results from the two computer programs occurs for the\nthird frequency of the lO by lO grid point network model. The difference\nbetween the computed results of the lO by lO and 30 by 30 networks is a result\nof the finer structural modeling for the 30 by 30 network. To test for solution convergence, a 20 by 20 grid point network was analyzed by NASTRAN and the\nresults were within approximately 0.5 percent of the 30 by 30 network solutions .\nTherefore, the 30 by 30 network results are considered to be the converged\nanalytical solution. The discrepancy between the analytical and experimental\nresults is attributed to the difficulty in providing a true clamped boundary\ncondition for the experiment.\nThe results of the analyses and experiment of the built-up wing are\npresented in Table II which gives the natural frequencies, degrees of freedom,\nand the CPU times for the computer solutions. Again it is possible to compare\nthe analytical and experimental results and the CPU execution times for the\ntwo analytical results. The results presented are the first four antisymmetrical frequencies of the wing which are actually the second, fourth,\nsixth, and eighth natural frequencies. The differences in the analytical\nresults from SNAP and NASTRAN for the two lower frequencies are attributed\nto the previously mentioned differences in the formulation of the membrane and\nshear finite elements of the two programs and in the number of in-plane\ndegrees of freedom. The two lower analytical frequencies compare very well\nwith the experimental results, while the two higher frequencies begin showing\nnoticeable differences of the order of up to 7 percent. These differences\nare attributed to the approximations made in modeling the structure for the\nfinite element solutions.\nFor both analytical models there was a one-to-one correlation between\nthe structural components used in the modeling of the structures for the two\nfinite element programs. The automatic grid point and element generating\nfeatures of SNAP were not used. The most significant difference between the\nsolutions provided by the two computer programs was the CPU execution times\nrequired to obtain the corresponding solutions. Even though the programs\nwere run on different machines at different facilities, as was pointed out\npreviously, the factor of l5 between the CPU execution times of the two\nprograms for the 30 by 30 grid point network flat plate model cannot be\nattributed primarily to machine or system differences. Rather, the factor of\n15 decrease in CPU execution time must be attributed to the differences in\nprograming techniques and solution strategies of the two programs. It is\nalso woith noting that the ratios of the CPU execution times for the two\nprograms are not constant with problem size. As the number of degrees of\nfreedom increases, the ratio of NASTRAN CPU time to SNAP CPU time increases\n(compare the ratio of 4 for the lO by 10 network and the ratio of l5 for the\n30 by 30 network of the clamped flat plate). It is noted that SNAP has been\nused in a number of applications (ref. 9) to compute the modes and frequencies\nof models which had 4000 to 8000 dynamic degrees of freedom and were substantially more topologically complex than the 30 by 30 flat plate model. Typical\nCPU times to get 5 to lO modes for these large order models were on the order\nof 60 minutes. Although the CPU time for SNAP is less than the CPU time for\nNASTRAN for the built-up wing calculation, the difference would be even greater\nif the two models had had the same number of degrees of freedom.\n\n64o\n\n\xc2\xb7Another difference in the two program solutions, which becomes very\nimportant when the size of the structural model becomes large, is the core and\nauxiliary storage unit requirements. For the largest problem considered in\nthis study (the 30 by 30 flat plate) SN.AP required approximately 0.75 million\nwords of storage to solve the problem, while NASTRAN required approximately\n3.25 million words to solve the same problem.\nThe results of this study suggest that parametric design studies involving\nthe calculation of natural modes and frequencies of large complex structures\nare economically feasible only if use is made of large scale finite element\ncomputer programs specifically tailored for operating efficiency. In addition,\nthe results indicate that use of sparse matrix solution techniques, such as\nemployed in SNAP, can provide order of magnitude decreases in CPU time compared\nto programs, such as NASTRAN, which use more conventional matrix solution\ntechniques, that are dependent on matrix bandwidth, and sequential matrix\noperations. Such reductions in computing time can greatly influence the\nselection of analysis tools for automated design procedures. Although work is\ncurrently underway to improve the operating efficiency of NASTRAN, it remains\nto be seen whether such improvements can significantly close the gap and make\nNASTRAN competitive with the highly efficient programs that now exist.\nIt must also be pointed out that CPU execution time is not the only factor\ninfluencing the cost of running a computer program. Peripheral processing\nunit (PPU) time will also contribute to computing costs, but since the method\nof computing PPU time varies from system to system a comparison of PPU times\nwas not made.\nIt would have been more meaningful to have run the two different programs\non the same machine, but unfortunately SNAP Dynamics is currently available\nonly on the Univac ll08. Conversion of SNAP Dynamics to the COC 6600 is\ncurrently in progress, and once this conversion has been completed, a true\none-to-one comparison between NASTRAN and SN.AP Dynamics for calculating\nnatural modes and frequencies can be made.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nTo explore the feasibility of using large finite element computer programs\nto develop automated design procedures or to make parametric design studies\ninvolving many iterations for aircraft structures, vibration calculations for\ntwo representative wing structures were made using two available finite element\ncomputer programs, NASTRAN and SNAP. These programs are based on different\nprograming techniques and solution strategies. Results for the first few\nmodes from the two computer analyses were compared with existing experimental\ndata, and found to possess the accuracy desired for parametric design studies\neven for complex built-up structures.\nThe central processing unit (CPU) execution times for each of the computer\nprograms were compared, and it was found that there were significant differences\nin the times required to find solutions for the two computer programs, with\n\n641\n\nNASTRAN requiring more time. Although the use of different computers and facilities could have had some effect on the differencs in computing times between\nthe two computer programs used in this study, the time differences are so large\nthat other factors must be the primary cause. Therefore, the differences in\nCPU execution times between NASTRAN and SNAP observed in this study are\nattributed to the differences in the solution strategies and programing techniques between the two programs.\nBased on the results of this study, it is concluded that parametric design\nstudies involving the natural modes and frequencies of large structures are\neconomically feasible only if use is made of large scale finite element computer\nprograms tailored for very efficient operation. At this time, the use of\nNASTRAN for such studies would be severely restricted because of the high and\nprobably prohibitive cost associated with the correspondingly high CPU\nexecution time.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nButler, Thomas G.; and Michel, Douglas: NASTRAN, A Summary of the Functions\nand Capabilities of the NASA Structural Analysis Computer System.\nNA.SA SP-260, 1971.\n\n2.\n\nWhetstone, W.

Reynolds\nConvair Aerospace Division of General Dynamics\nSan Diego, California\n\nSUMMARY\nAn in-house program (MIDAS IV) was recently developed to determine the transient response of an\nelastic structure under the influence of numerous complex boundary constraint conditions. With the\naid of a small intermediate Fortran processor, the output from MIDAS IV was input to NASTRAN.\nUnder the control of a user-developed DMAP set of instructions, NASTRAN produced SC-4020\noutput, suitable for 16mm projection, of the time-varying motion of a continuously deforming\nstructure.\nINTRODUCTION\nA recent redesign effort required that a highly redundant, reliable nose fairing jettison technique be\ndeveloped for the Atlas/Centaur launch vehicle. The costly nature of nose fairing jettison tests\nsimulating the many possible off-nominal conditions that might exist during a flight dictated that\nanalytic techniques be used to evaluate proposed jettison systems. The analysis would be required\nto simulate all possible conditions during a nominal jettison to develop structural loads and\ndeflections. More importantly, the analysis would be used to predict whether or how a nose fairing\nwould jettison if a constraint were momentarily imposed. The constraint devices were assumed to\nbe the separation fittings holding the nose fairing halves to each other and the launch vehicle.\nThe planned jettfaon sequence consists of the time-sequenced firing of 16 separation fittings. In\nthis operation, the two fairing halves are unlatched from the launch vehicle and each other. Two\nseparation spring cartridges, located in the forward area of the nose fairing, then push against the\nreleased half fairings, allowing the fairings to rotate away from the launch vehicle. Their jettison\ntrajectory is controlled by a hinge-release mechanism at the aft end of each fairing half. Figure 1 shows\na typical nose fairing.\nAn analysis was performed to determine if it were possible to constrain one or more separation\nfittings so that by absorption of the potential energy stored in the separation spring cartridges, the\nconstraint would be removed but insufficient energy or proper momentum vector would exist to\njettison the nose fairing. Such an analysis required the description of the elastic behavior of a shell\nstructure under the influence of time-dependent and deflection-dependent forcing functions.\nUnder the pressures of a high-priority investigation, it was necessary to select or develop an\nanalysis tool that could accommodate rigid and elastic modes and time-dependent and\ndeflection-dependent forcing functions with discontinuous boundary points. The tool would be\nrequired to handle the behavior of a separation fitting as it was time-released or as it broke in\ndirect tension or bending - i.e., under a deflection-dependent behavior. Also, once a constrained\nfitting failed by violating a deflection criterion, a reduction of the controlling deflection should not\nre-engage the fitting.\n\n647\n\nConsidering the many discontinuous parameters involved in the analysis, it was decided to use an\nin-house version of MIDAS, (Modified Integration Digital Analog Simulator, Ref. l ), known as MIDAS\nIV, to perform the basic analysis. As its name suggests, the program is a digital simulation of an analog\ncomputer and it readily provided the logic/switching capability and integration routines necessary to\nperform the transient analysis. To minimize the awkward matrix algebra aspect of the problem in such\na simulation, the structure definition was limited to seven generalized coordinates for each fairing half:\nfive rigid-body, one symmetric, and one antisymmetric. An evaluation of this abbreviated structural\ndefinition showed that for this analysis, the seven generalized coordinates per half could adequately\ndescribe the structural behavior. The analysis was more sensitive to the description of the boundary\nconditions than it was to extensive elastic definition. NASTRAN was considered for the basic analysis,\nbut was set aside due to inexperience with the transient analysis modules of NASTRAN, lack of\nverification of the operational status of the nonlinear force capability, and uncertainty in the\ntechnique to handle complex logic/switching problems.\nAs might be imagined, many different constraint possibilities were suggested and analyzed. The\nabove description is a considerable simplification of the jettision simulation. Typical MIDAS IV\noutputs involved monitoring more than 200 response functions; time-dependent printed and plotted\noutput of those individual response functions were obtained. It soon became apparent that, while\nvolumes of computer output were being generated and many very enlightening individual\ncharacteristi~s were being observed, an overall feel, or evaluation, of the influence of a particular set of\nconstraints on the elastic vibrating structure was lacking. At this point, it was decided to generate\nmotion pictures of th-e .deforming elastic structure under the influence of the more plausible constraint\nconditions.\nINTERFACING WITH NASTRAN\nThe Sdentific. Data Processing Laboratory at the San Diego operation of Convair Aerospace consists of ~\na CDC 6400 operating under the SCOPE 3.2 monitor system with the core storage available for batch\njobs being approximately 1400008 words. The level 1 I. 1.0 version of NASTRAN is operational on\nthis facility. The comments and restrictions discussed should be considered in light of the NASTRAN\nversion level and operating environment defined herein. The Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 is available\noffline and is used as an output device by both NASTRAN and in-house programs to generate 16mm\nand 35mm plots.\nThe task of generating the desired motion pictures consisted of four major steps:\n1. Run the desired MIDAS IV simulation to generate time-dependent generalized coordinates\non a recoverable storage device.\n2. Run an intermediate processor to develop the elastic deformations of the structure from the\navailable generalized coordinates as a function of time and output the information in a\nformat suitable for NASTRAN.\n3. Run NASTRAN to generate the time-varying deformed structure plots using as input the\ndata from Step 2.\n4. Convert the standard SC-4020 file output from NASTRAN to a form suitable for framing\non 16mm film and process the data to film.\nThe MIDAS IV simulation-generated magnetic tape output of the time histories of user-selected\nresponse functions include, in this case, the generalized coordinates of the modes used to describe the\nbehavior of the structure. With this file of data, an intermediate processor was developed to transform\nthe generalized coordinates to spatial motion of selected nodes on the structure and output these\n\n648\n\nmotions in a format suitable for NASTRAN. It was decided to introduce the data to NASTRAN using\nthe DTI bulk data input card format. The selected DTI data block name would then be referenced in\nthe appropriate DMAP instruction for plotting a deformed structure.\nThe original thought was to use the double-field input format due to uncertainties in the\nmagnitude of the motion. At first glance, it was not apparent that any selected (Fortran) F field\nformat in an eight-column wide field would be adequate to handle all motions from the nominal\nfairing jettison simulation to a highly constrained simulation, the maximum deformation ranging from\napproximately 254 cm (100 in.) to 1 cm (0.4 in.).\nIn developing the large-field (16 column wide) formatted data, an implicit restriction in\nNASTRAN was disclosed. A DTI NASTRAN logical record of data was formatted in 16-column fields.\nBy chance, the data was punched in an odd number of physical cards. When this information was\nsupplied to the NASTRAN input processor, unrelated fatal diagnostics occurred. The problem was\nthat NASTRAN defines a logical card as one containing eight fields of data, which in large-field\nformats requires two physical cards. Thus, for the above case of an odd number of physical cards per\nlogical record, the last physical card of the first logical record was only the first half of the last logical\ncard and the input processor read the first physical card in the next logical record as the second half of\nthe previous logical card. At this point, all input processing stopped because NASTRAN realized that\ncontinuation identifiers were inconsistent and data form was not correct. The moral is that logical\nrecords should contain integer multiples of eight fields of data in any combination of large- or\nsmall-field formats.\nIn spite of the pains taken to learn the above lesson, it was later decided to use the simpler small\nfield format. The problem here was that the desire was to make a 200-frame film. For the size of\nstructure considered, 20 physical cards of small-field formatted DTI data would be required per frame\nor a total of 4,000 cards of input - most being continuation cards. On the available computer facility ,\nthe NASTRAN input file processor required eight minutes of central processor time to digest a data\ndeck of this bulk (approximately 50 GRID and PLOTEL cards were also processed). This processor\ntime was attributed to the large number of continuation cards involved. Others at this facility have\nexperienced similar time expenditures when inputting large logical records of DMI and DMIG cards.\nThus, the thought of processing 8,000 large-field formatted data cards was dropped.\nThe intermediate processor between MIDAS IV and NASTRAN was thus configured to generate\nthe small field DTI data and action was taken to minimize the Fortran F format problem. Since the\nDTI data would, in general, be quite voluminous, an additional feature was added to the processor to\nmerge the data directly into a skeleton NASTRAN input data deck containing the desired Executive,\nCase Control, and other bulk data cards in a sorted manner. This disk or magnetic tape file of\ninformation would serve as the input to NASTRAN and alleviate punching large volumes of cards.\nThe second lesson learned was that the use of the "NASTRAN Card", described in Section 6.3.1\nof the NASTRAN Programmer\'s Manual, to redefine the system input/output (I/O) files on this\ncomputer facility is ineffective. It was necessary to make modifications to the NASTRAN routine,\nXBOOT, a CDC version peculiar routine, so that I/O file redefinition was available to the user through\nthe CDC control card causing execution of NASTRAN.\nThese difficulties overcome, it was now possible to acquire the desired execution of NASTRAN\nfrom the output of a user-developed processor.\nThe output for the SC-4020 plotter was designed to consist of some n frames of undeformed\nstructure, followed by deformed structure plots. Input parameters to the intermediate processor\ndictated the sampling frequency of the data; these parameters were varied, depending upon the nature\nof analysis simulation and the desire to view different response frequencies. The DMAP set of\ninstructions assembled to provide this output, along with a typical Case Control and abbreviated bulk\n\n649\n\ndata setup, is shown in Table 1. The data block defining the transient motions is labelled RVEC.\nIsometrics of the idealized fairing are shown in Figure 2 in the closed and partially jettisoned positions\n- the latter corresponding to approximately the top-dead-center of rotation of each fairing half above\nthe hinge axis. The structure\'s global coordinate system has been superimposed to interpret the Case\nControl and GRID cards.\nThe view for the motion picture production was selected to be the projection on the global x, y\nplane; i.e., a top view. In the analysis, the box structure representing the cylindrical portion of the\nfairing has a uniform cross-section, but for a top view, depth perception was desired. Since the\nperspective projection plot option is incorrect on this computer facility, the base of the box structure\nwas arbitrarily drawn 16% smaller than the frame at the cone/ cylinder intersection. This produces the\ntapered appearance of Figure 2. The benefits of this strategy are shown in Figure 3.\nExperimentation was necessary to devise the proper form of DTI header information so that the\ndata block could be interpreted in the context used in generating time-varying deformed structure\nplots.\nThe structure contained 26 nodes; thus, it was necessary to provide motion definition relative to\nthe undeformed structure for 26 x 6 or 156 degrees of freedom. As is evident in Table 1, the rotation\nterms were ignored and arbitrarily set to zero. Other integer data in the O DTI record defined the form\nof the data provided. The remaining DTI records defined the nodal motion in a time-slice manner.\nData contained in a typical DTI logical record is:\nSubcase number\nTransient response flag\nLoad set number\nTime value\nRow position of first element\nElement type\n3 unused integers\n156 data points of motion\nEnd of column mark\nEnd of logical record mark\n\n1\n3\n1\n\nt\n1\n1\n\n5989,6036,6065\nreal, single precision\n\n16777215\nENDREC\n\nThe only peculiarity noted is that the number of nodes defined in set I had to be greater than 26;\notherwise, the NASTRAN fatal error message 3003 appeared stating "Attempt to read past the end of\na logical record in data set SIL (File 107) in Subroutine FREAD."\nHaving provided a suitable data input format to NASTRAN, it was then possible using the DMAP\ninstructions shown in Table 1 to generate the desired SC 4020 plotted output. The Case Control cards\nshown in Table 1 are typical of those used to generate 20 frames of undeformed structure plots, one\nblank frame and 200 frames of deformed structure plots when the DTI data were input at\n0.005-second intervals of analysis simulation. Typical computer running times were:\nInput Processor (of approximately 4,000 cards)\n20 Undeformed Structure Plots\n200 Deformed Structure Plots\nGeneral NASTRAN Overhead\nTotal Central Processor (CP) Time\nTotal Peripheral Processor (PP) Time\n\n650\n\n500\n20\n220\n20\n760\n360 sec.\n\nThe standard mode of operation was to submit as one batch job to the CDC 6400 a two-step setup,\nconsisting of the execution of the intermediate processor, costing typically 20 CP seconds, generating\na disk file of the NASTRAN input, followed by execution of NASTRAN with the appropriate input\nfile redefinition via CDC control card.\nWith computer cost algorithms and efficient core utilization as primary motivations, it was found\nthat the above described job would execute in the same CP and PP times at 1200003 words of core\nstorage as at 1400003.\nSC-4020 TAPE PROCESSING\nExecution of the above NASTRAN job produced about forty pages of printed output (if the bulk data\necho were suppressed), containing informative messages from the plot module and a magnetic tape\nsuitable for processing by the SC-4020. Standard output from the SC-4020 consists of 35mm film,\nwhich is processed to obtain paper copy. Since 16mm sprocketed film was desired, special handling by\nthe SC-4020 operator was necessary. Two areas of difficulty occurred here.\nThe NASTRAN-generated magnetic tape included data directing film frame advance to the\nstandard SC-4020 software for producing 35mm film. When this facility\'s standard movie program for\ngenerating 16mm film was loaded, the NASTRAN-provided frame advance information was\nincompatible and a minor software modification to the movie program was necessary.\nThe second difficulty involved the scaling algorithm used by NASTRAN in sizing the structure\nfor plotting. Though user override is available, the default mode is to assume a square region for\nplotting. The structure is sized for plotting based on the MAXIMUM DEFORMATION information\nprovided in the Case Control. For this application, it was desirable to have a continuous display of the\nsame size structure throughout the film; thus, the same MAXIMUM DEFORMATION was used to\nscale both the undeformed and deformed structure plots. Since a nominal nose fairing simulation\nwould include considerable rigid body motion, additional care was needed in scale selection to avoid\nhaving the deformed structure plotted off the frame. Unfortunately, a I 6mm frame has a 4 wide by 3\nhigh aspect ratio. To accommodate the film size, the top view of the structure was selected for\nplotting with the principal motion being along the horizontal direction. Then by proper positioning of\nthe camera in the SC-4020, the operator was able to center the plotted data on the 16mm frame,\nthereby eliminating the loss of data due to off-frame projection during SC-4020 processing. A display\ncomparing the 16mm film framing of a horizontal and vertical jettison is shown in Figure 3 as it was\ngenerated by NASTRAN.\nRESULTS\nThe results of this exercise provided an output display of a continuously deforming structure. The\ntypical reaction of engineering personnel to such a display was significant comprehension of the\nsimulation results and a "but of course it behaves that way" exclaimer when many long hours studying\nindividual responses produced more questions than answers. It was necessary only to generate a few\nmotion pictures of the more plausible constraint conditions in the analysis to educate and inform the\nviewers of the scope of the problem being studied and the influence of selected boundary conditions.\nWhile it is difficult to evaluate the worth of the overall display in aiding analyst comprehension of the\nproblem, it became apparent that one hour spent studying the details of the information provided in\nthe motion picture was easily worth one or two days studying time-history plots of individual\ndeflections. For larger and more detailed structures, the benefits would be even more dramatic.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS\nThis task provided the opportunity to establish an important communication link between in-house\nprograms and NASTRAN. It defined the restrictions associated with large field bulk data input,\nrevealed the obstacle to CDC users in redefining I/O files, disclosed the costly nature of large bulk data\nsets where many continuations are involved, and provided an important tool in understanding the\ntransient response of a deforming structure.\nTo improve the efficiency in running NASTRAN in this mode it is apparent that more efficient\nmeans must be devised to input large blocks of bulk data where numerous continuation cards are\ninvolved. This may be achieved through modification to the NASTRAN input processor or by the user\ngenerating a properly configured user mast_ r file or old problem tape containing the desired\ne\ninformation. Should the need for 16mm plots from NASTRAN become more common, it would also\nbe desirable to modify the NASTRAN plot module to provide such capability as a user-requested\noption and avoid the need for special handling by the SC-4020 operator.\nREFERENCE\n1.\n\n"The SCI Continuous System Simulation Language (CSSL)", Simulation, Volume 9, No. 6,\nDecember 1967, pp. 281-303.\n\n652\n\nTable 1.

This\npaper describes such a program applied to NASTRAN that has resulted in cost savings\nin model checkout and increased flexibility in the use of NASTRAN. Shortcomings in\nusing the NASTRAN structure plotter and advantages of an on-line interactive graphics\nprogram are discussed. Program features such as arbitrarily oriented three-dimensional\nviews of beams, quadrilaterals, loads, constraints, and member sizes are describe.9-.\nPreliminary results are presented to indicate the flexibility of the interactive approach\nto model checkout. Future additions to the CDC 6400 program for reviewing analysis\nresults are indicated.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOn-line interactive computer graphics consists of a cathode-ray tube (CRT) for displaying information, a light-sensing device called a "light pen" for communication, and\na computer program that provides the information. The program first displays a list\nof instruction commands or options, called a 11 menu", from which the user makes a\nselection. The menu items or individual commands that cause program execution are\ncalled 11 1ight buttons." The program responds to user commands initiated by holding the\nlight pen over a "display item" or light button on the CRT and depressing a switch on\nthe pen. Upon receipt of the command the program displays further menus, performs\ncalculations, displays plots and diagrams, etc. , depending on the nature of the command\nand the type of program. In this fashion the user directs desired operations and responds\nto displayed information.\nInteractive computer graphics offers several improvements over the normal digital\nmode of operation. Turnaround time is reduced by the ability to display 11 immediately 11\nthe results of computation, modify the data, and recompute. Several iterations of the\nsubmit job, compute, look at printout, correct data, and resubmit process can be\ncompressed into one session at the display device. Judgment and insight to the problem\n\n659\n\nare enhanced by using the graphic display. Rapid comparison of various designs or\nanalyses, often essential during preliminary design or "panic" redesign, are readily\naccomplished.\nOne application area for the first interactive computer graphics system at Convair\nAerospace was the finite-element analysis of structures, for which a graphics program\nwas prepared to interface a large analysis program. The analysis program handled up\nto 2,160 degrees of freedom, and the preparation and checkout of data decks was a large\nand costly task. The interactive graphics program was successful in significantly\nreducing the cost and time for checking out the model and for understanding the results,\nand it became operational about the time NASTRAN was acquired. The success of the\noriginal graphics program, plus the limitations of the NAST RAN structure plotter, soon\nled to developing a similar program for NASTRAN.\nThe structure plotter in NASTRAN has several disadvantages. The technique of\nrepresenting three- and four-sided members by plotting their edges is confusing when\ncutouts are present or other elements are plotted. There is no provision for displaying\nmember properties, material properties, or applied loads. A given set of NASTRAN\nplots may be unsatisfactory due to errors in the request or poor viewing angles. If a\ngiven view is incorrect, another submittal of the NASTRAN job is required, and this can\nbe costly and time consuming. Interactive graphics does not have these limitations\nsin ce the user immediately views the requested plot and can correct errors in the plot\ns el ection.\nSeveral ground rules were defined at the start of developing NASTRAN graphics:\n1.\n\nNASTRAN graphics should be compatible with NASTRAN as far as input data\nis concerned, allowing a NASTRAN user to take his complete data deck,\nincluding restart cards and old problem tape, and enter them in the graphics\nprogram without change.\n\n2.\n\nThe graphics program should be modular and easily expandable to meet\nadditional requirements.\n\n3.\n\nThe graphics program process should be tutorial and relatively easy for a user\nto learn.\n\nThe graphics program has two primary functions. The first is to debug the structural\nmodel. This implies that the user should be able to display in a meaningful fashion as\nmuch of the information contained in the data deck as is feasible for a visual check for\nerrors. This includes geometry and a representation of all NASTRAN connection cards\nat arbitrary orientations. This function is being enlarged to display member properties\nsuch as cross section area, moments of inertia, and thicknesses, to display vectors\nshowing the applied loads, and to plot stress-strain curves and other tabular\ninput data.\n\n660\n\nThe second function of the program is to display analysis results. Deformed\nstructure plots for statics, buckling, mode shapes and transient response constitute a\nminimum capability as an output device. This second fuootion is being enlarged to display\nplots of internal loads on a portion of the structure, time histories of response functions,\nand the deformed structure at a selected time.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM\n\nThe NASTRAN interactive graphics program consists of two parts. The first is a\npreprocessor composed primarily of selected NASTRAN modules from Links 0, 1, and\n2. The function of the preprocessor is to read the user\'s data deck from cards and the\nold problem tape, and to generate a special file for use by the graphics program. The\nNASTRAN error-checking process during input has been left intact, allowing the user\nto obtain a printout containing the standard error checks associated with reading the\nexecutive and case control decks and the bulk data deck. Certain executive functions\nassociated with restarting and DMAPing have been omitted. This allows running an\nuntried data deck through the preprocessor for graphics before making an initial run on\nNASTRAN, without losing the error-checking capability of NAST RAN. It then allows using\nthe graphics program to visually check the model. If results of a previous NASTRAN\nanalysis are to be plotted, the preprocessor finds the appropriate data block on the old\nproblem tape and stores it on the file used by the graphics program. The bulk data cards\nlisted in Table 1 comprise the cards currently stored for graphics display. Others will\nbe added as required.\nThe second part is the graphics program, beginning with a menu of options (Figure 1).\nFrom this menu the user selects with the light pen the first option he desires for his first\nplot. The program then displays information concerning the selected option and waits\nfor further direction. When all the options for a given plot have been selected the user\n"picks" the PLOT lightbutton. The program then computes and displays the plot of the\nstructure according to the selected options (Figure 2). As each plot is displayed it may\nbe given a title by the user and stored. At a later time any combination of previously\ntitled plots may be redisplayed. This is particularly useful for overlaying undeformed\nand deformoo. plots (Figure 3). To create another plot the user picks a button that\nreturns the program to the menu of options .\nThree options are used to select which kind of connection elements are to be displayed.\n"One-Dimensional Elements" asks the user to select from this list of one-dimensional\nelements: CBAR, CONROD, CROD, CTUBE, or PLOTEL. All elements of the selected\ntypes will be plotted. Similarly "Three-Sided Elements" offers a choice of CTRBSC,\nCTRIAl, CTRIA2, CTRMEN, or CTRPLT. "Four-Sided Elements" offers a choice of\nCSHEAR, CQUADl, CQUAD2, CQDMEN, CQDPLT, or CTWIST. For all three of the\n\n661\n\noptions, if a particular bulk data type is not present in the data, its name does not\nappear in the list. Figure 4 shows an aircraft bulkhead composed of CSHEAR and\nCONROD elements.\nSince a given model may contain many grid points, and plots of the whole structure\nmay become confusing, two options are available to limit the portion of the model from\nwhich the connection elements will be displayed. One option allows the user to select a\nset of predefined grid points, called a substructure, to be plotted. These substructures\nare defined by card input for the preprocessor program and can be used to define parts\nof the structure the user wishes to view separately, such as a rib, bulkhead, or wing.\nThese substructures can also be defined from the CRT. The other option limits the\nportion of the model to be viewed by entering geometric limits on the model axis, thus\ndefining a subspace. Elements that extend beyond this subspace are not plotted. Figure\n5 is a geometric limitation of the model shown in Figure 2.\nAn option is available for the user to annotate the grid points with the grid ID or a\nsymbol, and four line - style options are available for plot construction. Selection of the\nlatter will result in the plot being constructed with solid, broken, dashed, or center\nlines. An undeformed plot can be constructed with solid lines and overlaid with a\ndeformed plot drawn with dashed or broken lines for easier distinction (Figure 3). The\nmodel may be viewed at any arbitrary orientation. This orientation is initially defined\nby inputting the projected angles between the model basic system and a display tube,\ntwo-dimensional coordinate system. After the model has been displayed at the initial\norientation, the user can rotate the model about any of the model axes through any\narbitrary angle. This permits altering the viewing angles at will.\nMagnification factors can also be input to stretch the model along any axis, for\nbetter visibility of members that might be hidden by other members.\nSelecting the PLOT light button with the light pen results in a plot of the structure,\nin 5 to 10 seconds, conforming to options the user has selected. It takes from one to\nthree minutes to select all the options required for a typical plot. The plots can be\nstudied at the tube or photographed for later use.\nDeformed plots are produced by first selecting the load s et, mode number, or time\nincrement for statics, modes or buckling, and transient response, respectively. The\nmaximum desired deformation is input and the procedure continues as for: any plot.\n\nHARDWARE-SOFTWARE\nThe graphics program uses 20,000 words out of a 65,000 (60-bit) word central\nmemo ry on a CDC 6400 computer operating under the Scope 3. 2 operating system. The\ntwo 274 CRT display consoles are each driven by a CDC 1700 computer, which can handle\n\n662\n\nup to six CRT \'s. One of the 1700 computers also acts as a remote job entry terminal\nto the 6400. If two graphics programs are run concurrently, they time share the same\ncentral memory in the 6400 computer. Scientific batch work runs in the background.\nThe program is written in Fortran IV using the CDC Interactive Graphics System (IGS).\n\nFUTURE ADDITIONS TO THE PROGRAM\n\nExpansion of the program in several areas is being considered, such as adapting\nan existing graphics program for general X-Y plotting. This would enable the user to\nproduce plots of tabular input data, such as transient forces or material thermal\ndependencies for debugging purposes, and X-Y plots of NASTRAN output data such as\ntransient response results. The user would be able to display time history plots and\nthen the deformed structure plot for any particular time.\nAn additional debugging capability for input data also is desired. Such items as\ndisplays of applied loads, member properties, and material properties would be useful.\nOnce items are displayed it is logical to desire to modify and add to the data at the\ndisplay console and punch out update cards for the NASTRAN data deck. Software to\ndo this could be written, as it was for a similar program at Convair Aerospace. The\nfeasibility of implementing this capability is being studied.\nThe capability to display more results is of immediate interest. Plots of internal\nloads, for example, can be superimposed on views of portions of the structure-shears,\naxial loads, moments, etc. - and can be easily understood if presented properly.\nMonitoring and control of automatic data generating programs can also be done with\nthe display tube. The user can see that the data generated is correct; if not he can\nregenerate the data.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAn interactive graphics program has been written for NASTRAN that produces\nundeformed and deformed plots of a structure without the limitations of the NASTRAN\nplotter. All the NASTRAN connection elements can be displayed. Plots can be saved\nand overlaid for comparison. The existing program is the first part of a program to\nreview more thoroughly the NASTRAN input data and also to display much of the\nNASTRAN output. Use of this program will result in cost savings during model checkout\nand in greater insight to using NASTRAN to solve structural problems.\n\nTable 1.

Ice\nBoeing Computer Services, Inc.\nSUMMARY\n\nThe following features have been incorporated at Boeing to make the\nusage of NASTRAN easier and less susceptible to error: 1) automatic\ngeneration of finite element input, 2) BCD/EBCDIC input transparency, and\n3) additional symbolic parameters in the NASTRAN user procedure.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe NASTRAN user interface, i.e. the communication linkage between\nthe user and NASTRAN, is a very important part of the NASTRAN system.\nNaturally the user must first correctly describe his problem to NASTRAN\nbefore he can expect NASTRAN to solve the problem. Therefor e it is important that the user interface allow quick and convenient pr eparation of\nthe problem with a minimum chance for input error. The feature s presented\nin thi s paper have been incorporated at Boeing to significantly improve\nthe standard user interfac e for the IBM 360 version of NASTRAN. These\nfeatures have significantly increased the usability of NASTRAN while\nreducing the chance of input error. They have also reduced the amount\nof training necessary for Boeing engineers to learn to use NASTRAN.\nSAIL/NASTRAN LINKAGE\nSeveral years ago a revolutionary finite element input capability\nwas developed at Boeing. This capability, called SAIL (Structural\nAnalysis Input Language), is a language used to describe basic finite\nelement input data such as gridpoints, element connections, loads, etc.\nHowever, unlike the usual finite element input schemes, SAIL does not\nrequire the user to explicitly input each logical item of data (i.e. each\ngridpoint, structural element, load, etc.). Instead, simple s traightforward techniques are available within SAIL for the user to describe\nalgorithms to generate blocks of data. In this manner, the user can take\nadvantage of patterns and sequences which may occur in his data. Usually\nstructures can be described within SAIL using only a fraction of the\ncards that would otherwise be required if each item of data were explicitly\ninput. It is not unusual for input card volume to be reduced by factors\nof four, ten, or even twenty.\n\n669\n\nSAIL Data Generation Techniques\nWhile a detailed description of the SAIL input capability will not be\ngiven here (more information is given in reference 1), the three major\ndata generating concepts employed by SAIL will be briefly described.\nIncremental Indexing. This feature is perhaps the most powerful and\nuseful of the SAIL data generating techniques. Looping and indexing\ntechniques similar to the Fortran "DO" loop are applied to finite element\ninput statements. To make use of the incremental indexing feature, statements to establish gridpoints, structural elements, loads, etc. are placed\nwithin loops such that they are "executed" a number of times, with each\nexecution establishing a new item of input in the series being described.\nAn example of this technique is given in Table l where the 65 gridpoints\nand 48 quadrilateral plates of the parabolic dish shown in figure l are\ninput with only 18 SAIL statements.\nSubstructure Transformation. This technique involves considering a\nset of input data to be a logical group (a substructure). This set of data\nis then translated and rotated to form other sets of data (other substructures).\nFigure 2 illustrates some possible uses of substructure transformations.\nExternal Data Generators. This concept is completely analogous to the\nconcept of subroutines in Fortran programming. Here data generating subroutines are written using SAIL statements and are "called" from the main\nstream of data input to generate desired sets of data. For example, an\nexternal data generator could be written which generates a rectangular\nstiffened panel when called. The inputs to the generator, or "calling\nsequence", might be the panel dimensions, panel thickness, and coordinates\nlocating one corner of the panel. The user could then build up a structure\nof stiffened panels by merely making several calls to the panel generator,\nsupplying a correct set of inputs for each call.\nThe SAIL data generating techniques will probably be somewhat obscure\nfrom these very brief descriptions. However, the important thing is that\nmost structur es can utilize these data generating techniques to reduce\ninput data volume. It should also be noted that data which is automatically\ngenerated will be uniformily correct - no isolat ed keypunch errors can\noccur.\nImplementation of SAIL/NASTRAN\nNaturally it was desired to utiliz e the SAIL input techniques for\nNASTRAN analyses. The implementation of the SAIL/NASTRAN linkage involved\nmodifying SAIL such that NASTRAN Bulk Data cards could be produced from\nthe basic finite element data s tored within SAI L. While ther e was not\na one-for-one corr espondenc e between SAIL and NASTRAN for all possibl e\ninput items, a basic set of data could easily be translated from the\n\nSAIL format to the NASTRAN Bulk Data format. This set includes gridpoints,\nelement connections, element property lists, material tables, loads,\ntemperatures, and single point constraints.\nTo complete the implementation of the SAIL/NASTRAN linkage. additional\njob steps were added to the NASTRAN user procedure to accommodate the SAIL\ncapability. The data flow was arranged so that the user supplies a\nstandard NASTRAN deck consisting of Executive Control, Case Control,\nand Bulk Data. Optionally, he may supply SAIL input also. In this case,\nthe Bulk Data which results from the SAIL input is appended to the set\nof Bulk Data supplied in the standard NASTRAN deck. This allows the\nuser to use SAIL as applicable and to supply the remainder of the input\nvia standard Bulk Data cards.\nAdvantages of .SAIL/NASTRAN\nOne obvious advantage gained by establishing the SAIL/NASTRAN linkage\nis that the powerful data generating techniques of SAIL can be used to\ninput NA.STRAN data. Another advantage is that Boeing structural analysts\ncan more easily learn to use NASTRAN because of their previous familiarity\nwith SAIL. The final advantage, and a very important one, is that a\nstructural problem which has been described with SAIL input can be\nsolved by using Boeing\'s own structural analysis programs or by using\nNASTRAN. This allows backup problem solving capabilities and provides\nindependent analyses for checking results.\nThe SAIL/NASTRAN linkage has also been valuable in acquainting\nBoeing engineers with the NASTRAN program. A typical engineer naturally\nprefers to use Boeing\'s own programs because he is much more familiar\nwith them. However, occasionally during the course of analysis, a\ncapabil ity is required which does not exist in the Boeing program, but\ndoes exist in NASTRAN. The engineer is then quite ready to consider NASTRAN,\nespecially since he does not have to re-program his input data. Soon he is\nfamiliar with NA.STRAN and incorporates it into his repertory of structural\nanalysis tools.\nSAIL/NASTRAN Applications at Boeing\nThe following NASTRAN applications at Boeing have relied upon the\nSAIL/NASTRAN linkage for success.\nNASTRAN Evaluation. Shortly after receiving the NASTRAN program,\nBoeing conducted an evaluation and familiarization study of NASTRAN.\nThe SAI L/NASTRAN linkage allowed many "off the shelf" problems to be\nrun on NASTRAN.\n\nBuckling Check. A large deflection analys is of a three dimensional\ntruss was conducted using Boeing\'s Advanced Structural Analyzer (ASTRA).\nThe results of this analys is showed structural collap se at a much lowe r\nload t han anticipated. A buckling analys i s was then made with NASTRAN,\nu sing the same input deck that was u sed in the ASTRA analysis. The\nbuckling load predicted by NASTRAN agr eed with the collapse load determined by ASTRA.\nHeat Shield Buckling. A buckling analys i s was r equir ed for a heat\nshi eld on the Burner IIA missil e. The shield was conical in shape , and\nthe analysis was required as quickly as possible. The entire problem was\ncoded within a few hour s u s ing SAIL,and the NASTRAN buckling results we re\nobtained by the next day.\nBCD/EBCDIC INPUT TRANSPARENCY\nNASTRAN norma lly expe cts input dat a to b e prepar ed u s ing the BCD\ncharacter set. The u se of BCD characters on Boeing\'s IBM 360 installation (where the EBCDIC character set is standard) is inconvenient and\nincre ases the chance of keypunch error. Therefore a simple procedure\nwas incorporated which eliminated the need for the NASTRAN user to\ndi stinguish between BCD and EBCDIC in preparing NASTRAN input.\nA separate job step was added at the begir..ning of the NASTRAN procedure.\nThis step execut es a small, simple Fortran program which reads each card\nin the NASTRAN input deck, substitutes BCD characters for EBCDI C\ncharacters as nec essary (only left and right parentheses, equal sign , and\nplus sign need be considered), and then writes the card into a data set\nwhich wi ll become the input t o NASTRAN.\nThis method of providing BCD/EBCDIC input transparency was very\neasy to incorporate and required no change to the NASTRAN program. The\nfew a dditional se conds of computer time r equired to proc ess the input\ndeck are more than offse t by the increa sed u se r conveni enc e and input\nerror r eduction. Note also tha t the added step can easily be discarded\nwhen N\nASTRAN has its own BCD/EBCDIC transparency.\nAUGMENTED NASTRAN USER PROC\nThe basic NASTRAN u ser procedure which i s delivered with the 360 version\nof NASTRAN provides the us er the ability to automatically obtain all the\nn ec essary JCL (Job Control Language ) for making a N\nASTRAN run u s ing no\nmagnetic tap es . However, if the us er wi shes to make a NASTRAN run which\nr equir es tapes ( e .g. a checkpoint run or a r es tart run), he must supply\nJCL to override the procedure and call for the proper tapes to be mounted.\n\nSince the construction of error-free JCL s tatements tends to be\ndifficult and confusing to the average engineer using NASTRAN at Boeing,\nthe NASTRAN user procedure has been augmented with some additional symbolic\nparameter s. These parameters allow the NASTRAN u se r to obtain JCL to\nmount tapes by merely coding keywords on the "EXEC NASTRAN" card. No\nother JCL is required. The augmented procedure makes NASTRAN much m\nore\nconveni ent to u se and practically eliminates the chanc e of a JCL error.\nThe complete list of parameters added to the user procedure includes:\nT = tt.\n\nA parameter for specifying the CPU time limit of the\nNASTRAN step.\n\nR = rrrK.\n\nA parameter for spe cifying the r egion size for the\nNASTRAN step.\n\nNEWPROB=.\n\nA parameter to call for a tap e to b e mounted on the\nNASTRAN unit for writing a new problem tape.\n\nOLDPROB=, OLDPTP=nnnnnn.\nSC4020=.\n\nA parameter to call for a tap e to be mount ed for generation\nof sc4020 plots.\n\nUMF=,UMFTP=nnnnnn.\nNUMF=.\n\nParameters to call for tap e nnnnnn to b e\nmounted as an old problem tape.\n\nParameters to call for tap e nnnnnn to be mounted\nas a user master file.\n\nA parameter to call for a t ap e to be mounted on the NASTRAN\nunit for writing a new User Master File .\n\nTo use thes e parameters, the us er merely cod es the applicable keyword s,\nin any order, on the EXEC NASTRAN card. For example, suppose a check-point\nrun i s to be made. The EXEC ca rd i s:\n\nII\n\nEXEC\n\nNASTRAN,NEWPROB=\n\nThe keyword "NEWPROB=" activates JCL to call for a tape to be mounted on\nthe NASTRAN unit for the new problem tape. Likewi se , if a re s tart run i s\nbeing made to us e a tape (serial number= 012345) which was generated on\na previous checkpoint run, the EXEC card could be written as:\n\nII\n\nEXEC\n\nNASTRAN,OLDPROB=, OLDPTP=012345\n\nNo additional JCL is required to mount the restart tape. If on the above\nre start run the user wished to specify a time limit and region s iz e and\ncreat e plots, he could code:\nEXEC NASTRAN,OLDPROB=,OLDPTP=012345,\nT=l5 ,R =560K,SC4020=\n\n673\n\n(Note: The EXEC card is continued in the normal manner of JCL continuation.)\nAgain no additional JCL is required.\nThe revi s ions r equired to incorporate these parameters into the NASTRAN\nprocedure are shown in figure 3. These revisions are, of cour se, for the Boeing\nfacility, but should require little modification for other 360 installations.\nJCL to incorporate the BCD/EBCDIC preprocessor discussed earlier is also\nshown in Figure 3, but the JCL necessary to implement the SAIL capability\nhas been omitted.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe features added to the NASTRAN u ser interfac e presented in this\np aper have all proven to be cost effective. The co st of implementing each\nitem has been more than offset by the increased NASTRAN usability and the\ndecreased input error potential. The NASTRAN program itself has not been\nmodified at all. Instead, JCL has been modified and peripheral programs\nhave been included in the NASTRAN system.\nREFERENCES\nl.\n\nGreene, Herness, Ice, Salus, and Strome, "ASTRA-Boeing\'s Advanced\nStructural Analyzer" published in "Structures Technology for Large\nRadio and Radar Telescope Systems", MIT Press, Mar and Liebowitz,\neditors.\n\nSAIL Statements\nCOORDINATE SYSTEM= CYLINDRICAL\n\nNotes\nSet coordinate sys t em to "cylindrical" .\n\nLOOP 1 FOR I= 1,13\n\nSTART\n\nSTART LOOP 2 FOR J = 1,5\nID = ( I-1)*5 +\nR\n\nJ\n\n= (J-1 )~ + 3 .0\n\nZ = (10. / 729.)*R*R\n\nLoop s to generate thirte en groups of five nodes\neach.

Giles\nNASA Langley Research Center\nand\nCharles L. Blackburn\nAVCO Aerostructures Div., Nashville, Tennessee\nSUMMARY\n\nAuxiliary computer routines which automatically generate input data for a\nwide variety of aerospace vehicles and graphically display output data in the\nform of contour plots have been developed for use with the NASTRAN analysis\nprogram. These routines offer a significant savings in man-hours requirei to\ndevelop a finite element model and to interpret the data resulting from an\nanalysis.\nThe input data routines provide a capability for developing large reliable\nfinite element models from a minimum amount of basic data pertaining to the\nexternal shape of the vehicle. For preliminary design studies, design changes\ncan be accomplished with substantial time reductions by using such routines.\nIn addition, the contour plots of the output data allow for rapid evaluation of\nthe voluminous results obtained in such studies.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe calendar time required for a finite element analysis results primarily\nfrom preparation of input data to describe the structural model. Weeks or\nmonths are often needed to prepare input for a structure containing a large\nnumber of elements, while the analysis can be performed in minutes or hours of\ncomputer time. A reduction of this input preparation time would expedite the\ntime required for an overall design process and reduce the manpower costs\nrequired for each analysis. Furthermore, as pointed out in reference 1, the\nprovision for automated data input is important for preliminary design in\nparticular since excessive time for input preparation could negate the\neffectiveness of efficient analysis and design procedures.\nAn important aspect of data generation routines, especially when the finite\nelement model contains a large number of nodes and elements, is the accuracy\nthe automated routine provides in dimensioning the nodes, numbering the nodes\n\n679\n\nand elements, and connecting the elements at the correct nodes, Even the most\ncareful finite element analyst has experienced difficulties with errors in such\ndata when the input is hand generated. Another arduous task in finite element\nanalysis is the evaluation of the multitude of results or output for the\nstructural response of large aerospace vehicles. Since the evaluation of\nvoluminous amounts of tabulated output data is very time consuming, the analyst\ntends to investigate only that data associated with areas of a structure\nbelieved to be critical, and actual critical locations may be overlooked.\nAuxiliary computer routines which automatically generate the input data and\ngraphically present the output data for the NASTRAN computer program are\ndescribed in this paper. These routines were developed for use in preliminary\ndesign studies where many simplified but widely varying external shapes and\ninternal structural configurations must be considered. Although the routines\nhave been exercised primarily on space shuttle orbiter configurati~ns, they are\nsufficiently general for application to a wide variety of aircraft configurations including hypersonic cruise vehicles and advanced technology transports,\nThe input data generation routines require a minimum amount of user prepared\ndata to generate a detailed finite element model. The basic input data\nrequired is geometric information which numerically describes an external\nshape. A fuselage, wing, and/or empennage structure can be automatically\ngenerated within this external shape.\nTo assist in data analysis and also to reduce the possibility of missing\ncritical design areas, NASTRAN oriented computer routines have been developed\nfor presenting the output in the form of contour plots. These contour plots\nare particularly useful for presenting stress distributions, deformation\npatterns, and vibration or buckling mode shapes. For structural optimization\nstudies, the thickness variation of skins, panels, or plates can also be shown\nby such plots.\nINPUT GENERATION\nIn order to perform a structural analysis of a complex aerospace vehicle,\nit is first necessary to construct a mathematical model of the vehicle structure\nfrom engineering drawings in a form amenable to the method of solution. For a\nNASTRAN analysis, the model is an idealized network of finite structural\nelements, A finite element model of any large structure, particularly a very\ncomplex configuration, may contain errors due to human judgment, mispunched\ndata cards, or incorrectly transcribed data. The following discussion\ndescribes two input data generation routines which substantially reduce both\nthe effort required to generate finite element models and the chances for\ninput errors in the models.\n\n68o\n\nFuselage Input Data Generator\nAlthough the fuselage input data generator was developed for fuselage type\nstructures, it is applicable to virtually any type of stiffened shell structure.\nThe structure is modeled as a series of stiffened shells referred to as fuselage segments . Since a complete fuselage is usually of considerable length with\nlarge .c ross-sectional dimensional variations, these segments allow the engineer\nto work with smaller and more uniform structural components, For example, it\nis common practice to reduce the fuselage into three segments: namely forward,\nmid, and aft fuselage sections ;\nEach segment of. the fuselage model contains a prescribed number of equally\nspaced frames which can differ from segment to segment . The perimeter of the\nframes is dictated by the cross sectional dimensions of the fuselage external\nshape. The present routine approximates a given external shape with elliptical\nsections and straight lines, This approximation adequately represents the\nshape, requires minimum basic input data, and permits easy determination of the\nframe\'s grid point coordinates. Presently, the frames are structurally modeled\nwith straight beam elements capable of withstanding axial, shear, and bending\nloads. Only minor modifications of the routine are required to implement a\nproposed generalization to p~rmit representation of the frames as deep beam\nmembers modeled with shear web and cap (or rod) elements .\nThe number of grid points about the circumference of a frame is dictated\nby the number of longerons, The desired number of longerons (and hence frame\ngrid points) is basic input data and is constant for all fuselage segments,\nbut the spacing of the longerons (and hence the length of the frame elements)\nis determined within the program. To obtain an adequate geometric representation the spacing of the longerons is closer in the regions of maximum curvature\nof the frames and the spacing widens with decreasing curvature. Similarly,\nthe straight beam elements used in the frame modeling are shortest in the areas\nof increased curvature, and they lengthen with decreasing curvature. The\nlongerons are idealized as axially loaded rod element s of length equal to the\nframe spacing,\nWith the shape of the frames determined and the number of longerons and\nframes specified the mesh size or nodal network of the finite element model\nis readily determined for a particular fuselage segment , The location of each\ngrid point within the overall fuselage structure is defined by a numbering\nscheme which identifies the segment , frame, and longeron position corresponding\nto the point, The coordinates of the grid points so determined by the routine\nare output on punched cards in the proper format for incorporation into the\nNASTRAN computer program,\nTo complete the finite element model the surface or skin of the fuselage\nis represented by plate membrane elements. The size of these elements is\ndictated by the mesh generated for the frames and longerons. Although the\nfuselage input data generator does not consider the offset of the rod and beam\nelements relative to the plate elements \' midplane, it could be readily modified\n\n681\n\nto account for the offset by using features within the NASTRAN program. Finally,\nthe connecting data for the entire set of structural elements is generated and\npunched on cards with a NASTRAN format.\nThe method described in reference 2 is used to define the external\n(aerodynamic) shape of an aerospace vehicle. A finite element structural model\nis generated inside this shape using the data generation routines. Figure 1\nshows the external shape definition of one concept of a space shuttle orbiter\nconfiguration and the corresponding finite element model of a segment of the\nfuselage structure containing 1400 degrees of freedom. User prepared input was\n70 cards to define the external shape of the fuselage, and 15 cards for the\nstructural model description. The resulting NASTRAN input deck that was\nautomatically generated and punched contained 1513 cards. The effort required\nto generate the model from engineering drawings using the methods of this paper\nwas less than 4 man-hours.\nWing and Empennage Input Data Generator\nAs in the case of the fuselage data generator a simplified input option is\ndesired for describing the structural arrangement of the wing within an external\naerodynamic shape. Such a program would serve as input data generator for both\nwing and empennage structures (horizontal and vertical tail) since the\nstructural arrangements of these components are similar. For the sake of\nbrevity only the wing will be referred to in the description of this routine.\nFigure 2 shows a structural arrangement for the wing and carry through\nstructure corresponding to the shuttle orbiter external wing shape shown in\nfigure 1. The numbered points indicate the corners of various substructures\nhaving quadrilateral (for example, 8, 11, 12, 9) and triangular (for example,\n3, 7, 4) planforms which are used for describing the total wing planform. The\ncorner point locations of the substructures are physically specified by values\nof percent chord and fraction of semispan. In general, these substructures\ninclude many finite elements used to represent the actual structural members\ncorresponding to ribs, spar, and cover sheets.\nFor the particular configuration shown, certain interior spars intersect\nthe leading edge spar, whereas all ribs are parallel to the orbiter centerline.\nThe number of ribs and spars in a substructure are specified by the user utilizing a numbering scheme for the corner points. TLis numbering scheme is based\non a five digit number in which the first two digits represent a particular\nrib, the second two digits represent a parti cular spar, and the fifth digit\ndesignates whether the corner point is on the upper or lower surface (1 for\nupper, 2 for lower). The ribs and spars are numbered consecutively from inboard\nto outboard and from leading to trailing edge, respectively. For exampl e ,\ncorner point number 8 of fi.gure 2 would be designated as 10071 corresponding\nto the intersection of the tenth rib and seventh spar on the upper surf ace .\nFrom the numbering scheme the program can det ermine the number of spars or ribs\nwhich intersect the sides of the substructure. These spars and ribs are then\nequally spaced along the sides and their grid points are calculated from the\n\n682\n\nphysical dimensions of the corner points. The elevation or z-coordinate\nvariation of the wing (indicating twist or camber) is determined from the\nexternal shape definition. The program yields this data in punched card form\nwith a NASTRAN grid card format.\nHaving generated the nodal network for the wing, the routine automatically\ngenerates the appropriate NASTRAN element cards. The finite element model\nconsists of plate membrane elements for the upper and lower wing skins and\nplate shear elements for the ribs and spars. Presently, the program does not\naccount for cap members or vertical stiffeners attached to the ribs and spars.\nIn order to maintain stability of the shear plate elements, a NASTRAN multipoint constraint card is generated to give equal vertical deflections for\nsimilar grid points on the upper and lower surfaces. To account for\nvariations in thickness of the various elements, appropriate NASTRAN property\ncards are punched for each finite structural element.\nFor the structure shown in figure 2, which has 911 degrees of freedom,\n30 basic data cards were required to describe the external shape and 38 cards\nwere required to generate a NASTRAN input deck of 1577 cards. Less than 2\nman-hours were required to generate the finite element model.\nGRAPHIC OUTPUT\n\nAlthough the NASTRAN program has a capability for making plots for both the\nundeformed and deformed structures, one must resort to the tabulated output to\ndetermine the magnitude of the displacements. It is sometimes difficult to\nvisualize the node lines from such plots of higher order vibration and\nbuckling modes. Furthermore, only the tabulated data for the stresses acting\non each structural element is available in the NASTRAN output.\nThe interpretation of NASTRAN output data can be facilitated by presenting\nthe data in the form of contour plots. Such plots make it possible for the\nknowledgeable design engineer to identify im~ediately the critical design areas,\nand they greatly facilitate evaluation of the large amounts of data generated\nin a typical NASTRAN analysis. The following discussion describes a routine\nfor efficiently generating displacement and stress contour plots directly from\nNASTRAN punched input and output data for surfaces with irregular boundaries\nrepresentative of current aircraft wing planforms.\nContour Plot Program\nAll NASTRAN output data are given with respect to a grid point or\nstructural element. The locations of the grid points or elements are specified\nin the NASTRAN input data deck, and for the most general case the locations are\ndescribed by three-dimensional coordinates. Therefore, to form contour plots\nfor a particular surface or planform, only output data corresponding to grid\npoints or elements on that surface or planform would be used. In the following\ndiscussion the grid point or centroid of the structural element will be called a\n\n683\n\ncontrol point for convenience of description. Also, the NASTRAN output data such\nas stresses, displacements, and mode shapes will be referred to as the magnitude\nor elevation of the contour surface.\nSince contour plots represent lines of constant elevation or magnitude of\na surface with respect to a datum plane, it was first necessary to develop an\nanalytical model that adequately described the contour surface. The model\nchosen was based on a series of connected triangular planes having coordinates\nat each vertex coincident with both the two dimensional control point\ncoordinates and the magnitude of the contour variable. These triangular planes\noffer two distinct advantages: namely, (1) a simple analytical expression for\ndescribing the flat plane and (2) easily obtained coordinates of the plane\nusing NASTRAN input and output data for triangular and/or quadrilateral plate\nelements. The quadrilateral elements are idealized as two triangular\nelements for development of the contour surface. Another advantage, due to\nthe formulation of the problem, is the increased accuracy of the surface as\nthe mesh size decreases to obtain a desired accuracy for the structural analysis.\nW\nith the contour surface idealized as a network of triangular plane\nsegments, the contour lines can be developed in a straightforward manner using\nthe following computation scheme. For a finite element analysis calculated\ndisplacements are associated with the actual grid points. Hence, for a certain\ntriangular contour plane the maximum and minimum elevation (values of\ndisplacement) at the vertices (grid points) are determined from the NASTRAN\ndata corresponding to the particular element. These maximum and minimum values\nand the specified contour inte r val are used to calculate the number of contour\nlines and their magnitude occurring in the triangular plane. Area coordinates\nare used to determine the intercepts of the contour lines with the edges of the\ntr i angular plane . By proper manipulation of the area coordinates the intercepts\nof the previously calculated contour lines with the edges of the triangular\nplane can be determined in terms of the datum plane coordinates. A contour\nline will have intercepts at two edges of the triangle, and the plot routine\nconnects a straight line between these intercept points. This method is then\ngeneralized to calculate all the contour lines within a triangular plane for\nevery triangular plane of the contour surface contained in a prescribed\nboundary.\nThe stress data resulting from a finite element analysis is associated\nwith the elements rather than the actual grid points. For data reduction the\nstresses are assumed to be acting at the centroid of the element. In addition\nto the control points located at the elements centroid, other control points\ncoinciding with the grid points are also used. The magnitude of the stress at\na particular grid point is determined from a weighted average of the appropriate\nstress values associated with those elements connected at the grid point. This\nincrease in the number of control points results in a finer mesh of triangular\nplanes for describing the stress surface than for the displacements. These\ntriangular planes are constructed in such a way that each interior element\ncontains a weighted stress value at one of its vertices. For those\ntriangular planes adjacent to tQe structure\'s boundary two vertices are based\non weighted data; hence~ near a boundary the contour lines are of questionable\naccuracy.\n\n684\n\nIllustrative Examples\nTo illustrate the potential value of these contour plots for numerically\nrepresenting the deformed structural shape, a NASTRAN static and vibration\nanalysis was performed for the space shuttle orbiter type wing shown in figure\n2. The wing carry-thru structure was allowed to deflect only in a direction\nnormal to the plane of the wing along the orbiter center line (line 1-2> fig. 2).\nThe leading edge tip of the wing root (point 3, fig, 2) and the intersection of\nthe wing and wing carry-thru (line 5-6, fig. 2) were constrained to have zero\ndeflection normal to the plane of the wing, The displacement pattern for the\nwing static displacement under a uniform pressure distribution on the exposed\nwing box is presented in figure 3. Vibration mode shapes for the first six\nmodes are presented in figures 4 to 9. These results show the relationship\nbetween two different methods of graphic output . The upper drawing in each\nfigure is a contour plot of the displacement. The lower drawing in each figure\nis the corresponding NASTRAN oblique plot of the deformed structure. Note that\neven the complex shape of the sixth mode is well represented by the contour\nplot. The magnitudes of the contour labels have been scaled for ease of\npresentation and hence show only relative magnitudes. The contour charts make\nit possible to perform an innnediate numerical evaluation of the NASTRAN\ndisplacement data. These contour plots present the essential data from\napp roximately 90 pages of tabulated data. A planned revision of the program will\nemphasize the node lines (zero deflection) by dashed lines for contour plots of\nvibration or buckling modes .\nA stress distribution based on the von Mises effective stress criterion is\nshown in figure 10 for the upper surface skin of the wing structure shown in\nfigure 2. This stress contour plot represents 3 pages of tabulated data.\nAgain, the magnitude of the contour lines have been scaled for ease of presentation. The contour chart readily identifies stress concentrations and regions\nof maximum stress. Since the membrane stress of a plate element is proportional\nto the element\'s thickness, a plot similar to figure 10 could be used for showing the thickness variation resulting from structural optimization studies.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nAuxiliary computer routines which automatically generate input data for a\nwide variety of aerospace vehicles and graphically display output data in the\nform of contour plots have been developed for use with the NASTRAN analysis\nprogram. These routines offer a significant savings in man-hours required to\ndevelop a finite element model and to interpret the data resulting from an\nanalysis.\nThe input data routines provide a capability for developing large reliable\nfinite element models from a minimum amount of basic data pertainint to the\nexternal shape of the vehicle. For preliminary design studies, design changes\ncan be accomplished with substantial time reductions by using such routines.\nIn addition, the contour plots of the output data allow for rapid evaluation\nof the voluminous results obtained in such studies.\n\n685\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nGiles, Gary L.: Procedure for Automating Aircraft Wing Structural Design.\nJournal of the Structural Division, ASCE , Vol. 97, No. STl, Proc.

Furuike and S. Yahata\n\nNorth American Rockwell, Space Division\nSUMMARY\n\nPresent finite element structural analysis capability has progressed to\nsuch a point that complex structures are described by tens of thousands of\ndegrees of freedom. This places an incre,asing burden on the engineer in terms\nof quantity of data (both input and output). The nature of the design process\nrequires the ability to update and change during the analysis. Pre processors, post processors and multiple level substructuring programs, in support\nof the general finite element program, partially fulfill these needs. The use\nof these auxiliary programs indicates a need for further developments to\nNASTRAN .\nINTRO DUCT ION\n\nThe Shuttle Program is a good example of a large complex structural system\nconsisting of multiple bodies, (namely the booster and orbiter vehicles),\nthat requires the model-modal-loads-stress (MMLS) solution. It would take\nmany tens of thousands of degrees of freedom with extremely wide, sparsely\nbanded stiffness matrices to have a fairly detailed mathematical model of\nthe vehicles. The NASTRAN (Refs. 1-3) program is a general purpose digital\ncomputer program for the analysis of large complex structures. There are\nmany other existing structural analysis computer programs that are not as\ngeneral as NASTRAN. Use of the NASTRAN program without aid of various pre\nand post processors is likely to lead to many human errors. The NASTRAN\nDMAP option to include auxiliary programs does exist. The data handling\nproblem increases at a more rapid rate than the increase in degrees of\nfreedom. The generation of satisfactory mathematical models will be assured\nwith a greater degree of certainty with the aid of these auxiliary programs.\nFurthermore, the use of programs like NASTRAN without the availability of\nmultiple level substructuring for analyzing the mated configuration will be\ncostly in money and schedule time.\n\n697\n\nIn order to help the engineer in performing structural analysis, an automated\ncomputer program logic to determine the model-modal-loads-stress (MMLS)\nsolution is presented in Figure 1.\nPRE PROCESSOR DATA HANDLING\n\nFinite Element Model\nAs the structure becomes large and complex, the need for pre processor\ndata management becomes very important. Initially, an automated stress model\nis generated by the finite element modeling computer program called NARFEM\n(North American Rockwell Finite Element Model) (Ref. 4). The mod~l generation\nprovides for an accurate production detail model, assists manual check,\nreduces and eliminates many human errors and provides models compatible with\npreliminary and finalized design. The NARFEM program (see Figure 2) is an\nessential tool to obtain the necessary output data for a minimum amount of\ncommand input. These data may represent hundreds or thousands of input cards\ndescribing the finite element model (geometry, mesh topology, element\ndescription).\nThe topology need not be well ordered. The automated modeling generator\nreduces the data handling by using the following: (a) an internal numbering\nsystem to take advantage of any regularity even in highly irregular\nstructures; (b) an internal computation of coordinates of many nodes from a\nminimum of geometric parameters; (c) mesh topology generation by taking\nadvantage of the regularity of the internal numbering sequence; (d) simply\ncontrolled renumbering systems that convert topology to irregular actual\npatterns. In order to provide a visual check, the NARFEM program produces\nCRT plots of each model. The options provided include the capability of\ngenerating various line diagram representations of the mesh topology. For\nexample the "beams only" plots can be separated from "triangular and\nquadrilateral elements only" in order to help the engineer check of missing\nelements.\nThe NARFEM program can read in existing modeling data which the user may\nwish to modify in order to study alternate design concepts on any portion\nof the original model. Figure 3 shows a typical structure in which the\n"erase" and "patch" features of NARFEM were applied to a detailed door model.\nHere the program performed the changes in the third quadrant and then rotated\n90\xc2\xb0 to formulate the desired fourth quadrant. Figure 3 also illustrates a\ntypical CRT plot of the automated node numbering of the door section.\n\nSUPPORT PROGRA...\\fS\n\nCONTRACT\nREQUI!l,:Y.ENTS\n\n\'sJ\n....\n~\n\ngi\n\ne\n\n~\nS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nC\n\no VInAC\n\no DYN LAND\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSTIFFNSSS CALC.\nDYNAMIC\nMODEL\n\n& TAXI\n\no JD DIAL\n0\n\nJD\nLA\n\nRr::GL\n1\n\nMODAL ANALYSIS\n\nSTABIUTY ANALYSIS\n\nNARSTRESS\n\nINTERNAL LDS\nSTRSSS,M.S.

Here only the symmetric half of the model is generated. The\nlarge dots shown in the figure indicate the points on the model which were\nretained for the dynamic model.\nPrint out review may reveal situations in whi9h the nodes should be\nrenumbered. NARFEM can renumber nodes and elements to reduce the unwanted\nwide banded matrices. The program can also remove any extraneous nodes or\nchange the numbering order. The model generator provides punched card output\nwhich can be used as input to programs like NARSAMS (Ref. 5). The output\ninformation includes element description, coordinate or grid cards, etc.\nFrom these and other control cards the stiffness matrix in free-free or\nreduced state is generated.\nThe NARSLAGS program (North American Rockwell Structural Loads Analysis\nGrid System) will generate loads for the stress model from input data of\nselected points. Figure 5 shows a typical illustration of the aerodynamic\ninput to create the loads idealization for the dynamic and stress models.\nIn general the dynamic model requires fewer degrees of freedom than the stress\nmodel. The NARSLAGS program also generates the loads due to structural\nweight. Both distributed mass and concentrated mass can be handled to\nformulate the mass matrix. The output of the structural loads program is\navailable on cards, tape, and/or printed form.\nMultiple Level Substructuring Approach\nMany configuration requirements almost dictate the necessity of a\nmultiple level substructuring analysis program. This can help reduce the\ncost of the MMLS analysis, to reduce errors, and to meet contract schedule\nrequirements of various components, subassemblages and assemblages. For\nintermediate structures, the need for single level substructuring may be\nsatisfactory. Reference 6 suggests the need of a substructuring program as\nan auxiliary processor to NASTRAN. The NARSESA program (which stands for\nNorth American Rockwell Structural Elastic Substructuring Analysis) is a\nmultiple level substructuring program (see Refs. 7 and 8). The multiple\nlevel analysis of reference 7 is an extension to reference 9. Many user\'s\noptions exist. The program can be used for substructuring as well as a\nmatrix manipulator for reordering, gathering, decomposing, and reducing\nlarge matrices that must be handled in and out of core.\n\n702\n\n~\xc2\xb7\n-\n\nFigure 4 -\n\no.o\n\n1W\n\n"\'5.0\n\nRZ\n\n--0\n\nTYPICAL THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL Il.LUSTRATING A ROTATED CRT\nPIDT VIEW\n\n703\n\n,,\n\'\n\n\\\n\n\\ \\\n\n\\\\ \\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\nI\n\n,\n\n\\\n\n\'--~\xc2\xb7\n\nSTRESS MOOEL & LOADS\nIDJ~ALTZATION\n\n\\\n\\\n\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\nDYNAMI\'; MODEL & LOADS\nIDr;A T.I ZA TION\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\nAERODYNAMIC LOAD~\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\n\\\n\n\'\n\n\\\n\nVarious product matrices obtained during the subset development are\nsaved for future substructuring steps. Since a great portion of the computer\ntime is spent on the decomposition, considerable effort was made to have an\nefficient matrix algorithm. A partitioned blocked data set technique was\nused to decrease the input/output data handling. The same blocking\ntechnique was applied for the forward and backward sveeps in the\nCholesky-reduction routine.\nThe NARSESA program performs an automated coordinate description check\nbetween mating substructures prior to any assembly to assure that the mating\nnqdes are compatible in spatial coordinates. The node numbers are generally\nnot the same at mating boundaries since each substructure may be numbered\nindependently of one another. An option was included to either manually\norder the rows or let the program automatically order the rows during\ngathering. This renumbering essentially reduces the combined assembly\nboundary matrix bandwidth. Hence, the computer time for decomposition\ndecreases sharply. The substructuring program will automatically keep\ntrack of all degrees of freedom at all levels and assemblages. Printouts\nhave a table of equivalence or an 11 Mcode" table to correlate user node\nnumbers to program computer numbers for every substructure at every level\nand assemblage.\nThe static solution for the substructuring boundary is determined at the\nhighest substructure level for each load vector. These boundary displacements are then automatically distributed back to the lower level\nsubstructures in order to compute the interior displacements. The cycle is\nrepeated automatically until all of the displacements are determined. Here\nagain the output displacements for each substructure are in the user\'s\noriginal notation.\nThe substructuring program is also used as a reduction routine to\nformulate the dynamics model from the s~tics model. The first level\nsubstructuring can be used to perform the assemblage and reduction. In\ngeneral, the modal characteristics solution of each substrucuure will\ngive indications as to obvious errors in either the mass matrix or\nstiffness matrix. Hence, considerable computer and modeling support time\ncan be saved by correcting any errors, human or otherwise, before\nproceeding onward.\n\n705\n\nPOST PROCESSOR DATA HANDLING\nThe post processor data handling on the MMLS solution involves the\ndetermination of the loads and stresses. Additional input data on the\ncontrol system, aerodynamics, propulsion, trajectories, impact loads, and\nconstraints are used during the dynamics stability and POGO investigations.\nHowever, these are usually analyzed by themselves in their functional area.\nIn the event that the structure is unstable, then a resizing of the mathematical model is performed. If the structure is stable, the internal loads\nand stresses are computed from the NARSAMS program by the STOM job option.\nThe NARSAMS program options include START, MTOS and STOM. The START jobs\nread in model data and compute deflections, internal loads and stresses.\nThe MTOS jobs read in model data and generate the stiffness matrix and loads\nvectors, renumbering identification, and restart information. The STOM\njobs read in model data and deflections for all nodes (obtained from another\nprogram such as NARSESA) to compute the internal loads and stresses. Only\na few cards are changed from the MTOS job. The stresses are computed based\nupon the plain stress, quadratic field, and/or best-fit fonnula for the nodes\n(as in reference 10). A user option to compute the stresses at each node\nof an element exists, however the stresses for sand\'Wich elements are\ncomputed per element rather than per node. The stresses in the facing\nsheets and the shear stresses in the sand\'Wich core are determined. A user\noption also permits computing stresses at only certain portions of the\nstructure. Another option is to choose the quantity of specific nodes and\ntheir numbers. Similar options for sandwich elements are also available.\nThe post processor \'Will print the output in meaningful fashion for direct\ndocumentation into a report. In order to eliminate the data handling of\nthousands of pages, and automated data search is being incorporated. The\nmaterial allowable data will be used to compute the margin of safety.\nDISCUSSION\nToday\'s structures engineer must have insight into modeling techniques,.\ndata disposition (either by cards, tapes, and/or disk packs), and be cost\nminded. More and more the engineer\'s use of general purpose and auxiliary\nprograms also requires some programming knowledge. The adaptation of\nvarious post, intermediate, and pre-processor programs now developed can be\nmade to large computer programs like NASTRAN and ASKA.

McDonough\nComputer Sciences Corporation\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThere are numerous options and features included in the NASTRAN plot package that\nare available to the user. To provide the analyst with a visual presentation of his\nresults, the basic static, modal, and transient analyses plots may be enhanced and\nclarified with the aid of model or lay-out specifications. As described in the NASTRAN\ndocumentation, the program is compatible with five plotter manufacturers\' equipment.\nThe results presented here were obtained from a Stromberg-Carlson model 4020 plotter.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecent development work on NASTRAN has produced significant improvements in the\nplotting software, not the least of which is a better understanding of how to more\neffectively use the three basic programmed modules: e.g. the. Structural Plotter (PL0T),\nX-Y Plotter (XYPL0T), and the Matrix Plotter (SEEMAT). The intent of this paper is\nto demonstrate some of the more important plotting improvements and techniques for\nbetter use of the graphic routines.\nNASTRAN, as described in references 1 and 2, provides the capability for generating\non any of several different plotters the following kinds of plots:\na.\n\nUndeformed geometric projections of the structural model,\n\nb.\n\nStatic deformations of the structural model by either displaying the deformed shape (alone or superimposed on the\nundeformed shape), or displaying the displacement vectors\nat the grid points (superimposed on either the deformed or\nundeformed shape),\n\nc.\n\nModal deformations (sometimes called mode shapes or\neigenvectors) resulting from real eigenvalue analysis by\nthe same options stated in \'\'b" above,\n\n709\n\nd.\n\nTransient deformations of the structural model by\ndisplaying either vectors or the deformed shape for\nspecified times,\n\ne.\n\nX- Y graphs of transient response or frequency response,\n\nf.\n\nTopological displays of matrices.\n\nThe plots presented here include those which are possible because of corrections to\nLevel 12. O and those which result from capabilities inaugurated for Level 14. 0.\n\nNASTRAN PLOTTER SOF1WARE OVERVIEW\n\nFigure 1 shows the five common software functions performed by all the plot generating\nroutines in NASTRAN to provide the above capabilities. Each of these major functional\nareas has been the source of errors or difficulties experienced by the users either\nbecause of misunderstanding of instructions and supporting documentation, or due to\nproblems with the hardware and software. A short discussion of each major function\nfollows in order to place in context the error avoidance techniques and enhancements\nimplemented in later versions of NASTRAN. These are the subjects of subsequent\nsections of this paper.\nParameter definition refers to the various plot request packet card entries and calling\nsequence parameters covered in the User\'s Manual respectively under Structure\nPlotting, X- Y Plotting, and matrix pictures generated by the utility Module SEEMA T.\nIn general, the parameters define the plotter name and model as well as the physical\nconstraints and modes of operation. In most cases default options are allowed.\nThe program structure itself is common with creation of one DMAP parameter (PLTNUM)\nfor passing the plot number, and two named common blocks which contain the values of\nall other physical parameters. Typical problems that have been encountered in the\nparameter definition area include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ncreation of extraneous lines when plotting structures or\ncurves containing over 100 distinct lines,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n710\n\nspecifications for time and eigenvalues greater than 10 8 ,\n\nthe misunderstanding and misuse of the MAXIMUM\nDEF0RMA TI0N card and the maximum deformation field\non the PL0T card,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nexcessive computer time for creation of complicated\nplots.\n\nParameter initialization refers to the programmed instructions that set various counters,\nswitches, and addresses to zero or other starting values at the beginning or other prescribed points in the computer program. In the NASTRAN case, two subroutines\ninitialize all parameters in two common blocks and provide the capability of the system\nto default to standard plotter and model indices as well as initializing such parameters\nas paper size and plot tape buffer size. Once initialization is complete, none of the\nparameters in the common blocks can be changed without repeating the initialization\nstep. A case in point was that in the event of a failure in module PL0T (or PRTMSG)\nand a subsequent restart, then the entire plot DMAP sequence had to be removed by\nthe ALTER capability in order to obtain proper initialized parameters. Additional\nparameters have been added to NASTRAN in Level 14. 0 to overcome such troublesome\nproblems as obtaining vectors without an underlay structure. This is achieved by a\nnew parameter \'\'N" which may be initialized by the VECT<;i1R option on the PL0T card,\nand thereby not draw any shape(s), but allow all other plot options to be exercised.\nPlot initiation follows parameter initialization and refers to starting the plotter. Prior\nto the start, the plot number is incremented. The actual starting is accomplished by\none subroutine which, when appropriate, will select the proper medium, generate an\nidentification plot, and insert the specified number of blank frames. A typical problem\ninvolving this area involved obtaining plots sequentially numbered on rigid formats 8\nand 11 if both structure and X-Y plots were requested. A particular rigid format ALTER\nwas required in the executive control deck to obtain the sequentially numbered plots.\nPlot creation in NASTRAN is accomplished by seven subroutines for performing the\nvarious tasks: e.g. AXIS, LINE, PRINT, SYMB0L TIPE, TYPFLT, TYPINT. There\nare three operating modes defined in these subroutines:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\naxis mode,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nstraight line mode,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ntyping mode.\n\nThese three m odes are totally independent of each other and are mutually exclusive.\nThis implies that only one mode can be active at any one point in time. Subroutine\nAXIS operates in the axis mode ; subroutine LINE operates in the straight line mode.\nThe problem s with this area of NASTRAN plotter s oftware have been relatively minor\nbased on the numbe r of reports from the user community and involve such things as\np eculiarities with particular plotter pens.\n\n711\n\nThe final common function of NASTRAN graphic program modules is terminating the\nplot. This is a relatively simple function and is accomplished by the same subroutine\nthat initiated the plot. The routine, upon sensing a negative argument, will terminate\nthe current subset of plot commands (as appropriate), skip to a new frame, and, if\nnecessary, write an end-of-file mark on the plot tape.\n\nTHE TEST PROBLEM\n\nThe test problem chosen to illustrate the three types of rigid format plotting is the delta\nwing. The problem itself, i.e. the bulk data, is the same as the standard NASTRAN\nDemonstration Problem 1-1, which is described in reference 3. Figure 2 is a simplified\nsketch of the original model but is the configuration used during the plotting exercises\npresented here. The bulk data is essentially unchanged since it resides on the deliverable\nNASTRAN User\'s Master File Tape. Since the object of this presentation is to demonstrate\nplot output (as opposed to specific numerical results), no adjustment was made to convert\nthe problem\'s existing English system units to international units. Therefore, where\ndata changes were required in order to perform the run, these data were in English units.\nData input in accordance with the allowable options and requirements of the program was\nchosen to obtain the desired responses in each of the three rigid formats used: rigid format 1 (static analysis), rigid format 3 (modal analysis), and rigid format 12 (transient\nanalysis).\nThe delta wing model is composed of membrane, shear panel and rod elements. Due to\nthe existence of symmetry or antisymmetry in the structure and loading conditions, only\none-quarter of the wing needs to be modeled. The midplane of the wing (the plane dividing\nthe wing into upper and lower halves) is a plane of symmetry as is the center plane that\ndivides the wing into left and right halves). The loading conditions are antisymmetrical\nwith respect to the midplane of the wing and symmetric with respect to the center plane.\nThe surface skin of the wing is modeled with membrane elements while the ribs and spars\nare modeled with a combination of shear panels and rods. The shear load carrying\ncapability of ribs and spars is represented by shear panels. The bending stiffness of the\nribs and spars is modeled with rod elements placed in the plane of the skin surface.\nSince a quarter model is used, the loading conditions require that an antisymmetric\nboundary be provided on the midplane and a symmetric boundary must be provided on the\ncenter plane. These boundary conditions are provided by constraining all grid points on\nthe m idplane in the X and Y directions and all grid points on the center plane in the X\ndirection. Supports for the structure are provided by constraining grid points 13, 33, 53,\n73 and 93 in the Z direction. Since no rotational rigidity is provided by the elements used\nin the model, all rotational degrees of freedom have been removed by the use of the\nGRDSET bulk data card.\n\n71 2\n\nstatic Rigid Format Plots\nThe first series of examples, of primary consideration here, is the static loading of the\nsample delta wing at two points on the wing tip. The first load is applied at point 16 on\nthe trailing edge, which is called subcase 1, and the second load is applied independently\nat point 36 on the .leading edge, which is called subcase 2. The loads are both equivalent\nto 2230 newtons, although 500 pounds is the actual value used during the computer run.\nThe major cards in the case control deck for the rigid format 1 plots are:\nSPC = 1\nSUBCASE 1\nSUBCASE 2\n\nreferencing the constraints previously discussed\ncontaining the load set 1\ncontaining the load set 2\n\nThe set definition cards are:\nSET1=1THRU17\nSET 2 = 18 THRU 22\nSET 3 = 50\nSET 4 = 1 THRU- 22\nSET 5 = 1 THRU 22, 50\n\nthe upper surface\nthe trailing surface\nthe tip surface\n\nEach set is individually plotted in its undeformed shape such as:\nFIND SCALE, 0RIGIN 1, SET 5\nPLQ)T SET 5, Q)RIGIN 1, DENSITY 2, SYMBQ)LS 6, LABEL GRID P<oINTS\nThis is shown in figure 3 at the default values for AXES and VIEW.\nTo view the sets at other than default values, the AXES and VIEW cards are used. For\nexample:\nAXES Z, X, Y\nVIEW 0. 0, 0. 0, 0. 0\nFIND SCALE, Q)RIGIN 2, SET 1\nPLQ)T SET 1, Q)RIGIN 2, DENSITY 2, SYMBQ)LS 6, LABEL GRID P0INTS\nThe top surface is shown in figure 4 rotated from the original bulk data orientation to the\nplotter orientation so that a truely scaled orthographic projection results. The other\ndefined sets may be positioned by similar orientation commands.\nThe set chosen for plotting deformed shapes is the trailing surface of the wing because\nthe effects of the tip loads can be seen with respect to the line of action.\nA maximum deformation parameter is required for scaling by the program:\n\n713\n\nMAXIMUM DEFORMATION 30. 0\nSince the plots depend on orientation, new AXES and VIEW cards are used:\nAXES Y, X, Z\nVIEW O. 0, 0. 0, O. 0\nFIND SCALE, ORIGIN 5, SET 2\nTo this point the set and orientation are defined and all following commands apply to the\nsame definitions:\nPLOT STA TIC DEFORMATION O, 1, 2, ORIGIN 5, SET 2, DENSITY 2,\nSYMBOLS 6, LABEL GRID POINTS, VECTOR Z, SHAPE\nThis command results in a deformed plot with an undeformed underlay for both subcases\n1 and 2. The plot obtained from subcase 1 is shown in figure 5. The original location\nof the grid points are marked with an asterisk and the final location with the chosen\nsymbol (the open circle). The vectors appear to be double density but this is a result\nof two grid point displacement vectors being colinear. These same plots could have\nbeen obtained without the subcase integers if the integer O were used alone because all\nsubcases are default.\nPLOT STATIC DEFORMA TI(JN 1, 2, ORIGIN 5, SET 2, DENSITY 2,\nSYMBOLS 6, LABEL GRID POINTS, VECTOR Z, SHAPE\nFigure 6 is the resulting plot for the subcase 1 load. This is similar to the preceding\nplot except that the underlay flag, integer 0, is missing so the result is only the deformed\nshape. This kind of plot could be obtained without the subcase integers or the SHAPE\noption because the deformed shape for all subcases is default. However, because the\nVECTOR option was used without the O integer, the direction of the vectors is reversed.\nPLOT STA TIC DEFORMA TI0N O, 1, 2, ORIGIN 5, SET 2, SYMBOLS 6,\nLABEL GRID POINTS, VECTOR Z\nOne of the resulting plots, shown in figure 7, is the undeformed structure with vectors\nfrom the original grid point positions to the deformed positions. The same plot could\nbe obtained without the O integer. The vectors can be omitted by either not using the\nVECTOR option or using VECTOR N.\nPLOT STATIC DEFORMATION 1, 2, ORIGIN 5, SET 2, DENSITY 2,\nSYMBOLS 6, LABEL GRID POINTS, VECTOR NZ\n\n714\n\nThe plot for subcase 2 is shown in figure 8. The structure is not plotted but the vectors\nare shown at their deformed and undeformed positions. The original positions are\nmarked with an asterisk and the final positions are marked with the chosen open circles.\nThis plot can also be obtained with the integer O.\nPL0T STATIC DEF0RMATI0N 1, 2, 0RIGIN 5, SET 2, DENSITY 2,\nSYMB(jLS 6, LABEL GRID P0INTS, VECT0R NZ, SHAPE\nFigure 9 is the plot obtained from subcase 1 conditions. The structure is not plotted\nbut the vector directions are reversed from the previous example.\n\nModal Rigid Format Plots\nThe second series of plots obtained are those due to the unloaded wing whereby the\nnatural vibration frequencies are calculated and the normalized mode shapes are plotted.\nThe method chosen to extract the eigenvalues from the dynamic matrix equation\n[ K - 11, M] { u} = { 0 } is the Givens method. (In the above equation K is the stiffness\nmatrix, M is the mass matrix, and u is the displacement matrix. The quantity, 11,,\nrepresents the eigenvalues which are the squares of the natural frequencies.) The\neigenvector normalization method chosen is normalization to unit generalized mass.\nThe delta wing is an 86 order problem, and as expected, the Givens method outputs all\neigenvalues at once. Only ten eigenvectors are chosen for consideration as optioned on\nthe EIGR bulk data card.\nIn order to produce the desired results the case control deck is constructed to conform\nto the adjusted bulk data deck. Specifically, the two forces from the static case are\ndropped and an eignevalue method is adopted. Everything else remains the same.\nIn addition, the case control deck output requests are set up so that the eigenvectors\n\nreference a subcase by use of the M0DES card.\ntechnique:\nSUBCASE 1\nM(jDES = 2\nDISP = N0NE\nSUBCASE =- 3\nDISP = 1\nSUBCASE 5\nDISP = N0NE\nSUBCASE 7\nDISP = 1\nSUBCASE 8\nDI~P = N0NE\n\nThis is accomplished by the following\n\nimplies two subcases (modes)\nno output for the first two modes\noutput for the third mode for a selected set\nimplies fourth mode displacements after subcase 3\nimplies sixth mode suppression after subcase 5\n\nno output beyond the seventh mode\n\n715\n\nThe plot package contains the upper wing surface element set selection:\nSET1 = 1THRU17\nA maximum deformation is set:\nMAXIMUM DEF0RMA TI0N 25. 0\nThe command\nFIND SCALE, 0RIGIN 1, SET 1\npositions the plotter and scales the object.\nThe plot from the command\nPL0T 0RIGIN 1, SET 1, DENSITY 2, SYMB0LS 6, LABEL GRID P0INTS\nis shown in figure 10.\nThe plots resulting from\nPL0T MQ)DAL DEF0RMA TI0N 3, 4, 7, 0RIGIN 1, SET 1, DENSITY 2,\nSHAPE\nare shown in figures 11 and 12.\nThese two plots indicate a need for further investigation because they are not as expected.\nIt is suspected at this time that a problem exists in the subcase counting method because\nof the following table of results:\nSUBCASE\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n\n10\n\nOUTPUT\n\nPLOT\n\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nYES (ok)\nYES (no)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nYES (5th mode)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\n\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nYES (no)\nYES (3rd mode)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nYES (5th mode)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\nNO (ok)\n\nIt can be seen that the modal deformations, however selected, yield a mode shape for\na particular eigenvalue.\n\n716\n\nTransient Rigid Format Plots\nThe final series of plots are obtained from the transient analysis of the\xc2\xb7 wing which is\nsubjected to a time dependent force. The dynamic matrix equation employed in\ntransient analysis is [ p 2 M + pB + K] {u} = {P} where P represents a force, sinusoidally\nvarying with time, p is the differential operator d/dt, B is the damping matrix, and the\nother quancities are as previously defined.\nThe case control deck parameters required to augment the adjusted bulk data deck include\nthe omission of the static forces and the use of a dynamic force, a damping force, and a\ntin,e step flag. The eigenvalue selection method is the same as that employed previously.\nThe dynamic force used is one described by the equation associated with a TLOAD2 bulk\ndata card. After certain options, obtained with the aid of a DAREA bulk data card, the\nloading e\'luation evolves to P(t) = 50. 0 cos [2 ,r (40. 0) t + 45\xc2\xb0] applied at point 36 in the\npositive Z direction. The peak amplitude force of 223. 0 newtons (50. 0 pounds used), at\na forcing frequency of 40. O hertz is 45\xc2\xb0 out of phase from the undamped natural frequency.\nIn addition a structural damping force linearly varying with frequency is described by:\n\nl\n\nO.Olf\nG = 0.1 f\n1.0 f\n\nOSf<lO.O\n10. 0 S f < 100. 0\n100.0 Sf< 1000.0\n\nand appears on a TABDMPl bulk data card. A TSTEP card describes ten time steps,\none second apart and the LFREQ and HFREQ PARAM cards were the other cards added\nto the bulk data deck.\nSince both the structure plotter and the X-Y plotter are employed for this series, the\ntwo sections of the plot package are separated by the output requests 0UTPUT(PL0T)\nand 0UTPUT(XYPL0T) respectively. Other parameters related to the SC 4020 X-Y\nplotter will be discussed later.\nThe upper surface of the wing is chosen as the plot package set:\nSET 1 = 1 THRU 17\nThe deformation and scale initializations are:\nMAXIMUM DEF0RMATI0N 25. 0\nFIND SCALE, 0RIGIN _ SET 1\nl,\nThe command\nPLOT TRANSIENT DEF0RMA TI0N TIME O. O, 10. O, SET 1, 0RIGIN 1,\nDENSITY 2, VECT0R Z, SHAPE\n\n717\n\nresults in ten plot frames for each of the ten time steps chosen but only nine plots\nresult. This is because the SHAPE option suppresses the undeformed shape and no plot\nresults for time zero. Figure 13 shows the plot at time of 1.0 second.\nThe command\nPLOT TRANSIENT DEFORMATION, TIME 0.0, 10.0, SET 1, ORIGlN 1,\nDENSITY 2, VECTOR Z\nresults in the ten plot frames with a plot in every frame. Since the SHAPE option was\ndropped, all ten plots are in the undeformed shape. Figures 14 and 15 show the plots at\ntime zero and time of 1.0 second.\nFor the X-Y plotter package, some of the parameters are stated in a different manner\nfrom the structure plotter.\nThe microfilm plotter DENSITY 2 option which appears in all the structure plotter commands is now changed to a separate card:\nDENSITY = 2\n\nThe frame skip counter is optional to suppress the default skip of one between each\nframe with\nSKIP = 0 (or SKIP BETWEEN FRAMES = 0)\n\nIt should be noted that in the structure plotter case, the skip between each frame is\nalways zero except between the undeformed and deformed plots (where the skip is one),\n\nso skip commands in that series were not necessary.\nIn the case of the SC 4020 plotter the equipment flag must be set to choose the option of\nplotting on paper only. Thus CAMERA= 2 suppresses the creation of a film strip.\nOne plot frame (figure 16) is produced to demonstrate the various options available in the\nX- Y plotter package:\nXYPL<;jT DISP / 36 ( T3, T3 )\nThe command itself provides an X-Y plot of the displacement (response by default) of\ngrid point 36 (the loaded point in the example). There is one frame with two graphs (one\nupper and one lower), both depicting the response in the Z (T3) direction. With the exception of the symbols , the upper graph plot was obtained completely by the defaults available in the X- Y plotter package.\n\n7l8\n\nThe parameters which define the graphs of the upper and lower half frames are summarized in the following table:\nLower Half Frame Commands\nXBAXIS = \xc2\xb7 YES\nXBGRID LINES = YES\nYBGRID LINES = YES\nYBV AL UE PRINT SKIP = 1\nYBDIVISIQ\'NS = 10\nYBTITLE = RESPQ\'NSE\n\nUpper Half Frame Defaults\nNo\nNo\nNo\n0\n5\n\nNone\n\nThese commands provide that the lower graph has an X-axis, grid lines parallel to the\nY-axis, grid lines parallel to the X-axis, values placed on tick marks with one tick\nskipped between labels along the Y-axis, 10 tick divisions along the Y-axis, and Y-axis\ntitle, respectively. By default the maximum and minimum values along the Y-axis are\nobtained to accommodate all values on both graphs and the X-axis is drawn at y = 0.\nSince symbols placed on the curves is not separable, one command\nCURVELINESYMBQ\'L = 2 places the symbol X on both graphs at plotted points.\nThe maximum deflection occurring at time of 1.0 second is of the order 10-5 while all\nother values from time 2.0 to 10.0 seconds are so small, they appear nearly equal to zero.\nCLOSURE\n\nThe static analysis rigid format plot package presently seems the most versatile. Aside\nfrom the problem encountered in the modal analysis plot it remains for further study to\ninvestigate the possibility of employing all the static plot features to the two dynamic plot\nrigid formats.\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

The procedure has been programmed to operate as\na postprocessor to determine response changes from sets of displacements\ndeveloped for the initial structure by an independent structural analysis system. Examples given show substantial savings in computation time when\noper a ting in conjunction with the NAST RAN structural analysis system.\nINTRODUCTION\nEfficient methods of reanalysis are useful to assess the changes in\nstructural response as a function of modifications to the properties of the\nindividual member components of the structure. The applications encompass\nall design phases through inception and future alteration, particularly in\nconjunction with the implementation of the techniques for structural\noptimization.\nCurrently, a number of diverse procedures for reanalysis have\nevolved to operate within the overall formulation chosen for analytical solution of the response problem. Some have been designed to be used in conjunction with force method, displacement method, or mixed formulations.\nAdditional alternatives depend for their attractiveness upon whether or not\nthe number of members for which modifications are considered form a relatively large or a relatively small set, or possibly whether or not the modified\nmembers can be readily localized to occur within restricted regions of the\nstructure. Reference 1 describes several of the currently prevalent and useful reanalysis procedures.\n\n*This paper presents the results of one phase of research carried out at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under Contract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.\n\xc2\xb7\n\n737\n\nSome procedures are mathematically exact in the sense that the s olutions will be exactly equivalent to solutions that would be obtained from analysis\nof the modified structure ab initio. Others develop approximate solutions that\nare sufficiently accurate to serve during intermediate stages of structural optimization techniques. All methods usually appear to fall within either of two\nclasses:\n(1)\n\nGiven the inverse of-the stiffness matrix for the initial structure,\nthe inverse for the modified structure is developed by perturbation (refs. 2, 3 , and 4), An alternative to avoid dealing with the\ninverse of the stiffness matrix is to operate in terms of its decomposition ( ref. 1).\n\n(2)\n\nThe solution for the modified structure is developed as a linear\ncombination of solutions for the initial structure (refs. 5, 6,\nand 7).\nPROPOSED METHOD\n\nIn the following, an exact method of solution will be described that\ndevelops displacements and member forces for the modified structure from\nlinear combinations of displacement function solutions developed for the initial\nstructure. Conceptually, the method is based upon a parallel element approach.\nFor each component member to be modified, a h ypothet i cal parallel member\nis postulated . Cross -s e ctional properties of the parallel member are taken as\nexactl y equal to the changes in properties of the parent (original) member and\nthe connectivity is duplicated. The final member forces for the modified\nstructure are the sums of the member forces on parent and parallel members.\nA condition of the solution is to maintain compatibility of the parent and parallel member distortions. Figure I illustrates the approach for compatability\nenforcement and displacement superposition for a plane truss structure subj ected to a single loading condition and with only one member to be changed,\nIn this case, the member distortion consists of the axial extension.\nReanalysis is performed by a postprocessor computer program that\nuses input displacement functions developed previously by an independent\nstructural analysis program. Because the only computed data that are input\nare the displacement functions, the analytical formulation procedure used to\nprocess the initial structure and develop these displacements is immaterial.\nThe present implementation of the program is designed to accept input specifically in the format of the NASTRAN analysis system. A present limitation\nis the restriction to process only changes in the cross-sectional area property\nfor one-dimensional bars. This limitation, however, is compatible with the\ndesign requirements of space-truss structures, such as the frameworks of\nantenna reflectors. Nevertheless, it is feasible to extend the procedure to\ninclude beam-type bars. The advantages of this method are the simplicity of\nprogram operation and input requirements and the efficiency with which parameter studies can be developed for the response as a function of a spectrum\nof property changes for particular bars. Entirely new members can be added\n\nby parallel members, and original members can be completely removed by\nassigning duplicate properties of negative magnitude to the parallel member.\n\nMATHEMATICAL FORMULATION\n\nAt first, we will make the conventional assumption that the change in\nexternal loading caused by the changes in the weights of modified bars need\nnot be considered. Subsequently, an adjustment to include these effects will\nbe indicated. Consequently, the displacements of the modified structure UM\nare obtained by superposition of displacements of the initial structure UI\n(assumed as invariant with respect to property changes) and the displacements\n.6.U caused by the internal forces of the parallel members acting as loads on\nthe initial structure. That is,\n(1)\n\nThe order of the matrices in equation (I) ism X k, where mis the number of\nunconstrained degrees of freedom and k is the number of external loading\nvectors.\nTo evaluate .6.U, it is convenient to express these displacements as\nthe product of the displacements for unit values US of the parallel member\nforces postmultiplied by the forces R of the parallel members, or\n[.6.U]\n(m X k)\n\n= [US]\n\n[R]\n\n(2)\n\n(m X b) (b X k)\n\nIn equation (2), the index b is equal to the number of property changes summed\nover all the members.\nTo enforce compatibility, let\n\n= final distortions of parent members = distortions of parallel\nmembers\n= initial distortion of parent member for the external loads\n= distortions of parent member for unit values of forces of the\nparallel members\n= distortions of parallel members \xc2\xa3or unit forces\n\n739\n\nTherefore, from superposition\n\n+\n\n[es]\n\n[R]\n\n(3)\n\n(b X b) (b X k)\nBut eF can be determined directly as the distortions of the parallel members,\n(4)\n\nAfter combining equations (3) and (4) and rearranging, R can be obtained by\nsolving\n(5)\n\nThe solution of equation (5) for R can be obtained readily in many instances\nbecause the order of the coefficient matrix is equal only to the total number\nof property changes.\nExamination of equation (5) shows that relatively little additional computational effort is necessary to process more than one property change for a\ngiven member. This can be done by saving the es and e matrices in equation\n1\n( 5) and repeating only the relatively minor effort in regenerating new e matri 0\nces. In this manner, the responses for sequences of property changes for\ngiven members can be obtained efficiently .\nAfter combining equations (1) and (2), the final displacements of the\nmodified structure are obtained from\n\n=\n\n+ [us]\n\n[R]\n\n(6)\n\n(m X b) (b X k)\nThe final _ ember forces can be found either by summing forces on parent and\nm\nparallel bars, or else by expanding the indices of equation (3) to cover all of\nthe members of interest and then applying the internal force-distortion relationship for these members.\nIn the limited case of one-dimensional bar members, the member\ndistortion is the extension of a bar along its axis and is given by\n\nS.L.\n1\n\n1\n\nei = A.E.\n1\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\nwhere S., L., A., and E. are, respectively, the member force, length, area,\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nand modulus of elasticity for the ith member. As an alternative to equation (7),\nthe present implementation computes the extension from the grid coordinates\nand displacements associated with the bar as follows:\n\n740\n\ni = 1,2,\n\nb\n\n(8)\n\nw here q?\' is the difference in displacements of the terminal nodes of the bar in\n1\nth\nthe direction of the a\naxis of Cartesian coordinates, H~ is the projection of\n1\nth axis, and\nthe bar axis along the a\n\n( 9)\n\nThe computations for equations (8) and (9) are performed by using the\nmember connection cards to define the terminal nodes and the grid cards to\ngive the nodal coordinates. These data can be duplicates of the input for the\noriginal structural analysis program. The displacements used to generate the\ne set are the responses to the applied loading. The displacements that gen1\nerate the es set are obtained by applying a pair of unit loads directed towards\neach other at the terminal nodes associated with each parallel member; each\npair of loads forms one loading vector and contributes one column of displacements to the u matrix, which is used to compute one column of distortions in\n8\nthe es matrix. The US columns are readily produced by NASTRAN using\nFORCEl bulk data cards to define the loadings.\nThe unit loads that produce the es set are equilibrated by corresponding unit loads that extend the parallel member.\n\nConsequently, the e\n\n0\n\nmatrix is\n\na diagonal matrix of distortions for unit tensile loads, with each diagonal element of the form\n\nL.\n\n1\n\neO = A.E .\n1\n\n( 10)\n\n1\n\nwhere A. is the change in area for the i th member and this can be positive or\n1\nnegative, depending upon whether the area of the i th member is to be increased\nor decreased.\nThe foregoing procedures can be adjusted to include changes in loading caused by modified member properties. To do this, additional loading vectors that are the result of unit areas for the parallel members are processed\nby the initial analysis program. The corresponding new displacement functions\n\n741\n\nare supplied to the postproces sor program, which multiplies these by the\narea currently being processed for the parallel member and adds the result\nto the UI displacements. Consequently, in equation (5), it is necessary to\ngenerate a new eI vector for each property change in a sequence.\nPROGRAM EXECUTION AND CONCLUSIONS\nA flow chart of the reanalysis program described for invariant external loading is shown in figure 2. The program is developed either to process\nproperty changes for individual bars or common property changes to groups of\nbars.\nTable 1 contains a summary of the central processing unit times for\nprogram operation (Univac 1108 Exec 8 computer) for two different structures\nthat have been reanalyzed by this program. For both structures, the input displacements were read from a tape which was created by suppressing NASTRAN\noutput punch card images by means of the executive breakpoint feature of the\n1108 computer. The central processing unit (CPU) times shown include, in\naddition to computation time, the time used for data input (card and tape reading) and a substantial amount of printed output.\nTwo NASTRAN runs were made in each case of table 1. The first run\nwas made independently of reanalysis requirements. The purpose was to check\n_ tability of the analytical model and to provide some insight into which members\ns\nwere the most desirable candidates for revision. When the checking can be\neliminated and the members to be changed are known in advance, reanalysis\ncan start from the second run, which generates all needed information. The\ntime used for the first run, however, gives an indication of the time required\nto process one additional group change of member properties in lieu of using\nthe reanalysis postprocessor program.\nTable 2 illustrates the advantages in computation total time that can\nbe obtained by using the reanalysis procedure to process up to four property\nchanges for a given bar group for the two structures. The tabulations show\nthe time to analyze each modification as a new structure by using NASTRAN\no:!1.ly and the time to process the modifications by the reanalysis program.\nThe 11 NASTRAN only 11 column does not consider program restarts, because\nexperience does not show significant economies in restarting when the basic\nstructure is modified. Although table 2 shows substantial advantages for reanalysis postprocessing when at least two changes are considered, the benefits would be even more pronounced whenever the first NASTRAN run is eliminated and only the second NASTRAN run (table 1) is used.\nBecause the number of computations depends upon the number of\nchanges, computational time savings are the largest when the number of members with changes is a relatively small proportion of all of the members.\n\nWhenever a large number of members are jointly to be given a small number\nof changes, the advantages of reanalysis tend to diminish. For example, if\nall members were to be changed, the time to generate the US displacements\nwould be equivalent to the generation of the full flexibility matrix. In addition,\nit has been found that when changes in the external loadings are included, th.e\npostprocessor program takes about 50% more computation time. Therefore,\nthe relative efficiency of complete reanalysis within the initial program should\nbe considered.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nKavlie, D., and Powell, G.

Wilkinson and Robert E. Fulton\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe procedure of approximating thin elastic shells with flat plate finite\nelements has been accepted practice for several years, and the initial version\nof the NASTRAN program is restricted to this procedure for the analysis of\ngeneral shell shapes. The present paper investigates the convergence properties\nof the QUAD2 element contained in NASTRAN for approximating shell structures.\nApplication is made to the stress analysis of cylindrical and conical shells,\nand NASTRAN results are compared with those obtained from classical shell\ntheory. The results converge monotonically to the exact shell theory results\nas the mesh size is reduced . They also indicate that, for the cylindrical\nshell, the flat plate approximation has a principal truncation error of the\norder of the square of the element size.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe procedure of approximating thin elastic shells with flat plate finite\nelements has been an accepted structural practice for several years (see, for\nexample, refs. 1-4). Partly as a result of this practice, the initial version\nof the NAS TRAN system (ref. 5) contains only flat elements to model general\nshell structures.\nThe present work investigates the quality and convergence of results obtained by using the NASTRAN flat elements to model shell structures for static\nstress analysis. The element used in the modeling is the quadrilateral plate\nelement designated in NASTRAN as the QUAD2 element. This element contains both\nbending and extensional behavior and could be considered a reasonable model\nfor approximating shell bending behavior.\nThe procedure used in the study is to compare NASTRAN finite element\nresults for decreasing element sizes with results obtained with classical shell\ntheory. Two isotropic shell problems are studied which undergo asymmetric\nbehavior and for which the essentially exact solution can be obtained. The\nfirst is a simply supported cylindrical shell subjected to normal pressure which\nis harmonic in both the axial and circumferential directions . The second is a\nsimply supported conical shell subjected to normal surface pressure which varies\nharmonically in the circumferential direction.\n\nSYMBOLS\nshell radius (figs. 1 and 6)\n\nA,B,C\n\ndisplacement amplitudes in equations (1)\n\nE\n\nYoung\'s modulus\n\nL\n\nshell length (figs. 1 and 6)\n\nm\n\ncircumferential harmonic\n\nM\n\nbending stress resultant in the axial direction\n\nN\n\nnumber of elements in the axial direction\n\nN\n\nmembrane stress resultant in th e axial direction\n\nX\n\nX\n\np\n\nnormal pressure loading (perpendicular to shell surface)\n\nr\n\nerror measurement of deflections or stresses\n\nt\n\nshell thickness\n\nu,v,w\n\naxial, circumferential, and radial displacements\n\nu,v,w\n\nfunctional coefficients in the conical shell problem defined in\nequations (2)\n\nX\n\naxial coordinate\n\n\\)\n\nPoisson\'s ratio\ncircumferential stres5\ncir cumferential angle\nA subs cript\n\ns\n\nindicates the variable is obtained u s ing Sa nders\' theory.\n\nCYLINDRICAL SHELL EXAMPLE\nConsider an isotropic circular cylinder described in the cylindri cal\ncoordinate system shown in figure 1.

This problem has several\nattractive features for comparing shell modeling results . It includes both\naxisymmetric (m = 0) and asymmetric deformations (m 2 1). It also includes\ndeformations wh ich are predominantly membrane (m = 0) and those which are\nprimarily inextensional (m = 2).\nThe general shell behavior is modeled by QUAD2 elements and the calculations are simplified by taking advantage of symmetry in both the axial and\ncircumferential directions. Using this symmetry, one-quarter of the cylinder\nwas modeled with the four grids shown in figure 2. This grid refinement provides a finite element model which has a constant aspect ratio of arc length\nto axial length and lends itself to ex trapolation procedures,\nThe shell properties in the example are :\na=\n\n76,20 cm (30 in.)\n\nL\n\n4.572 m (180 in.)\n\nt\n\n= 2 . 540 cm (1.0 in.)\n\n6\nE = 206.8 GN/m2 (30 x 10 psi)\nV\n\n= 0,3\n\nThe finite element results are compared with two shell solutions to the cylindrical shell, A highly accurate solution to Sanders \' shell equations (ref. 6)\nbased on finite difference techniques was obtained with the SAL0RS shell of\nrevolution program (ref, 7).* A second solution was obtained from an ex act\nsolution to the Flugge theory (ref. 8), taking advantage of the harmonic\ncharacter of the solution. In NASTRAN, the finite element results provide\ndisplacements at node points and stresses at each element \' s centroid . The\n*A sufficient number of finite difference stations was taken to ensure\nthat the SAL0RS results had converged to an essentially exact solution .\n\n751\n\namplitude of the finite element results can be compared with the amplitude of\nthe results obtained from the exact solutions since for the example problem\nboth results are doubly harmonic in the x and 0 directions.\nResults are given in figures 3-5 for the ratio of the amplitude of the\nfinite element results to the amplitude of the Sanders theory results obtained\nfrom SALORS for the four grid sizes N x N where N is the number of elements in\neach direction and has the value 3, 6, 12, or 24. Results are given for the\namplitude of the lateral and longitudinal displacement and the circumferential\nstress on the outside surface cr~. The abscissa of these plots is the square\nof the ratio of m, the circumferential harmonic, to N, the grid size parameter.\nIn the special case of ax isymmetric loading where m = 0, the abscissa is\ntaken to be (l/ N)2.\nThe results show that, as the element size is reduced, the finite element\nresults for both displacement and stress converge to the exact shell theory\nresults. Furthermore, as the exact result is approached the plots appear to\nbecome linear; thus the convergence rate becomes of the principal order of the\nsquare of the element size denoted herein as g_uadratic converg_\nence.\nTo further investigate the convergence, the four NASTRAN solutions have\nbeen ex trapolated using the Richardson h6 extrapolation procedure (ref. 9)\nand the results are given in table 1 together with the results obtained with\nthe Sanders and Flugge shell theories , In all instances, application of this\nextrapolation procedure to the data virtually eliminates any error in the\nnume r ical resu l ts when compared with either shell t heo ry . Thus, the results\ncorroborate the error analy sis of reference 10 and show that the NASTRAN\nQ\nUAD2 elemen t has quadratic convergence properties for this problem.\nCONICAL SHELL EXAMPLE\nAs a second example consider the conical shell shown in figure 6 loaded\nwith a normal pressure\np = cos m0\nThe ends are geometrically constrained against motion; that is,u = v = w = 0 at\nx = O and x = L, and the meriodional moment also vanishes.\nFor this problem\nthe displacements in cylindrical coordinates are of the form\n\nw\n\nu\n\nV\n\n752\n\n= w(x)\n\ncos m0\n\n(2a)\n\n=\n\n~(x) cos m0\n\n(2b )\n\n=\n\nv(x) sin m0\n\n(2c )\n\nwhere the coefficients w, u, and v are functions of the axial coordinate x.\nTaking advantage of symmetry in the circumferential direction half of the\ncone is modeled with finite elements using mesh sizes N x 2N where N = 2, 4, 8\n(see fig. 7). Finite element results were compared with converged results from\nSanders\' shell theory obtained with the SALORS program for the following\nproblem:\nal\n\n=\n\n25.4 cm (10 in.)\n\na2\n\n=\n\n101.6 cm (40 in.)\n\nL\n\nt\n\n101.6 cm (40 in.)\n=\n\n0.254 cm (0.1 in.)\n\nE = 206.8 GN/m2 (30\nV =\n\nX\n\n10\n\n6\n\npsi)\n\n0.3\n\nThe NASTRAN solutions for this cone problem have a harmonic variation in\nthe circumferential direction and a nonharmonic variation with x along the\n.meridian. Thus, to understand the difference between the finite element and\nexact results, one must compare the axial function coefficients, for example,\nthe w(x) of equation (2a), with the corresponding NASTRAN output . Similar\nfunctions may be compared for each stress component.\nSeveral of these function coefficients for the radial displacement and the\ncircumferential stress at the outer surface have been plotted in figures 8\nthrough 10, The figures demonstrate the convergence of the NASTRAN solution\nto the shell solution. Note that the results from the NASTRAN model generally\napproximate the shell solution but have significant error near the shell ends.\nThese errors could be significantly reduced by using a finer grid mesh near\nthe shell boundary, but such grid refinements are inconsistent with the\npresent uniform convergence study.\nTo investigate the convergence of the results, it is convenient to reduce\neach function coefficient to a single scalar quantity. The procedure used\nis to calculate the error measurement\n\nr =\n\n753\n\nwhere ws is the radial displacement obtained from the SALORS solution.\nquantity r is equal to unity only when the NASTRAN and Sanders theory\nsolutions are identical.*\n\nThe\n\nThese error ratios for both the deflections and stresses shown in\nfigures 8 - 10 are given in table 2 and plotted in figure 11. The results show\nthat in all cases the error ratios tend toward unity as the grid is refined.\nHowever, it is apparent they are not as accurate as occurred for the cylinder,\nFurthermore, the fact that these plots have pronounced curvature indicates that\nthe principal terms in the convergence rate of r are not quadratic. A\npossible explanation for this behavior is contained in reference 10 where it was\nshown that adjacent elements had to be the same size in plate problems in\norder for the convergence to be quadratic. This condition is clearly violated\nwith the model of this cone problem.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nA study has been carried out on the use of the NASTRAN quadralateral\nplate element to model the behavior of shell structures for static stress\nanalysis. Results have been obtained for cylindrical and conical shell examples. The results indicate that a simply supported elastic cylinder can be\nsuccessfully modeled with the QUAD2 flat plate finite elements of NASTRAN.\nSeveral forms of harmonic pressure loading were investigated. As the grid was\nreduced the finite element solutions of the cylindrical shell examples\nconverged monotonically to the shell solution with quadratic order of error\nterms. A similar investigation of a simply supported elastic cone also\nproduced results which compared favorably with classical theory\xe2\x80\xa2 however the\n.\n\'\nmagnitude o f error was substantically greater than the cylinder \' for a comparable mesh size. Furthermore, although convergence was monotonic it did not\nappear to be quadratic. These studies suggest that the QUAD2 flat plate finite\nelement contained in NASTRAN can be used to model the general behavior of thin\nelastic shells and, if sufficient elements are used, will be expected to converge to results obtained with classical shell theory.\n\n*Application of this error measurement to the previous cylinder problem\nproduces the same error values as those previously cited. This occurs because\nboth the exact and NASTRAN solutions are doubly harmonic in the x and 0\ndirections.\n\n754\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nB. E. Greene, D. R. Strome, and R. C.

R. Groorm ands. Yahata\n\nSpace Division, North American Rockwell\nSUMMARY\n\nA brief sketch of the method of substructuring is given. \'!he benefits\nwhich accrue from using this method of anaJ..ysis \xc2\xb7 on complex structures are\ndiscussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nWhile substructuring, in principle, is not really a new idea its application has not been widespread. Substructuring has probably been in use for at\nleast two decades althougtl the mathematical fotmdation was published by\nPrzemieniecki in 1963 (Reference 1). A somewhat different method has been\npresented by Rosen and Rubinstein (Reference 2). Explanations of the method\nalso can be found in several other places (References 3 and 4). In structural\nengineering (as well as roost other branches of engineering) too often the\nproblem is forced to fit the existing analytical tools rather than developing\nthe tools to solve the problem. \'!his particular phenomenon seems to account\nfor the minimal use of substructuring.\nThe shuttle vehicle basically consists of two mated elastic bodies; the\nbooster and the orbiter. \'Ihe structural analysis of this vehicle lends itself\nvery naturally to nrul tiple level substructuring. \'Ihis approach inherently\nresolves some of the m:>re troublesome problem that occur when an analysis of\na conplex structure like the shuttle vehicle is undertaken. The main\nadvantages of using substructuring are:\n(1)\n\nInvestigation of various configurations\n\n(2)\n\nI:esigp studies\n\n( 3)\n\nSefgl\'ented model verification\n\n( 4)\n\nEase and cost of solution\n\nEach of these items is discussed in detail in a separate section of this paper.\nWhile N.ASTRAN does not explicitly include substructuring, it has all the\nmatrix routines necessary to accooplish it. \'!hat is, with some effort, N.ASTRAN\ncould perform substructuring. Substructuring could also be performed by using\nN.ASTRAN in conjunction with an existing substructuring program such as NARSESA\n(Reference 5).\nIn order to make some of the later concepts discussed in this paper clear\na brief outline of the computations involved in substructuring (using the\ndisplace!lEnt irethod) is now given. A stiffness matrix (free-free) is generated\nfor each of the substructures. Each of these ( K(r) , where the superscript\ndenotes the substructure nunber) is then partitioned:\n\n[ Kt!] [ Kri; ]\n\n[Kt/] [Ktl]\n\'Ihe subscript i denotes interior nodes while the subscript b stands for\nboundary nodes (nodes that tie to other substructures). A reduced matrix,\nK(r) , is then obtained using\n\nOperations are also performed with the load and displacement vectors but the\ndetails, because of space considerations, are not included (see Reference 1).\nAfter reduced boundary ma.trices are obtained for each of the substructures\nthese reduced ma.trices are then superposed. \'Ihis is done in the following\nmanner:\n\n~\n770\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-~\n\nThe double cross-hatched region represents the ties between substructures.\n.\ntotal ] , can then be inverted (decorrposed) and\nThis final reduced matrix, [ Kb\nused with the transformed load vectors to obtain boundary deflections. These\nboundary deflections are then used along with the substructure stiffness\nmatrices to compute deflections for the entire structure.\n\nINVESTIGATION OF VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS\nFigure 1 shows a sketch of the mated booster-orbiter. Figures 2 and 3\nshow finite elerrent models for the orbiter and booster, respectively.\n\n\'Ihe analysis of the shuttle vehicle consists of analyzing three distinct\nstructures: (1) booster alone, (2) orbiter alone, and (3) orbiter and booster\nmated. Under the one-pass (i.e., without substructuring) system of analysis\nthree separate mathematical nodels would be required. \'Ihe computational effort\nrequired to obtain these three solutions could be considerable.\nHowever, if substructuring (multiple-level) were used, a significant\nreduction in the computational effort would occur. \'Ihe booster and the orbiter\ncould each be formulated as large substructures and solved individually. Then\na great portion of the corrputations required to analyze the third configuration\n(booster and orbiter mated) would have already been done and saved. This is .\nillustrated by Figure 4. Specifically, the Kb matrices for the booster and\norbiter will already be available and can be readily supe?1)osed (after partitioning, etc.) to yield a Kb matrix for the mated configuration. \'Ihus the\nwork required to obtain a solution for configuration 3, after configurations 1\nand 2 have been handled, is relatively minimal.\n\nIESIGN STUDIF.S\nWhen design changes are made they usually dictate that a whole new analysis\nbe perfon-red. Consider the case where the three configurations enumerated in\nthe previous section are of interest. A portion of the orbiter wing is changed\n(e.g., different stiffener size). If a one-pass solution had been obtained for\neach of the configurations then two (orbiter and orbiter and booster mated) of\nthe three analyses would have to be corrpletely redone.\nIf the rultiple level substructuring scheme outlined in Figure 4 is used\nthen for configuration 2 the following computations have to be redone: lu and\n3b . For configuration 3 computations lu, 3b, and 4a have to be redone. For\nconfiguration 1 none of the cO!ll)utations have to be redone.\nThe use of substructuring makes the process of structural optimization\n(e.g., mininrurn weight, fully stressed, etc.) rore feasible than it has been.\nDifferent designs (anything can be varied except location of tie points) can\nbe investigated without requiring a corrplete reanalysis.\n771\n\nSEGMENTED MOIEL VERIFICATION\nFbr the analysis of a large conplex structure such as the shuttle vehicle\nthe prevention and rectification of nndeling errors is a huge task. If a onepass analysis is undertaken a considerable ntmber of conplete runs might be\nrequired before all nndeling errors could be detected and eliminated. Since\nthese runs would probably be fairly long, the cost of verifying the ITB.thernatical\nm::idel could be enornous. However, if substructuring were used the nndel could\nbe verified by making much smaller runs - analyzing each substructure separately\nbefore forming the assemblage. Also, it is quite possible to have each\nsubstructure nndeled by a different individual and hence reduce the calendar\nt1.Ire required for the analysis.\nPn analysis of each substructure with its boundaries (tie points) fixed\n,.(r); - 1\nrequires few additional conputations. An inverse for each substructure, [l\\iJ ,\n\nwill have been conputed and can be used with any load vectors to obtain denections. Gross nndeling errors should becoire apparent when these denections are\nstudied.\n\nEASE AND COST OF SOLUTICN\nWhen a .one-pass solution is attempted the analysis of a structure with\nappendages (e.g. , space shuttle vehicle) can :cause considerable difficulties .\nIf the vehicle were nndeled without using substructuring, the bandwidth of\nthe stiffness matrix might be very large . . With the use of substructuring the\nvehicle could be divided into several substructures where each of these has a\nreasonable bandwidth. Therefore, it can be readily shown that for certain\nclasses of structures the solution using substructuring can be cheaper than a\none-pass solution.\nAlso, when a one-pass solution of a large structural problem is attempted\na great deal of faith is inherently put in the reliability of the computer.\n\'Ihis can be hazaroous when the tire required for a particular step is longer\nthan the usual "up" tire of the ma.chine. Substructuring helps to reduce this\ndanger by doing the computations in relatively small independent portions.\nAdditionally, depending on the particular installation, it is usually easier\nto run many small jobs instead of one large job.\nAn analysis was performed at Space Division, North American Rockwell, of\nthe Space Shuttle vehicle. \'Ihe orbiter (Figure 2) and the booster (Figure 3)\nwere each divided into a ntmber of substructures. Table 1 g1 ves the total\nnurrber of degrees of freedom (OOF) , max1mum semi-bandwidth (SBW), and a\ndescription of each of the substructures in the booster. Table 2 gives similar\ninformation for the orbiter. Because of symnetry only half of each structure\nwas nndeled. Fbr comparison purposes, the size and ma.x.1nrum semi-bandwidth of\nthe booster and orbiter (for a one-pass solution) stiffness rratrices are given\nin Table 3. Substructures 2, 6, 8, 9, and 11 were joined .as one assemblage\n(Figure 4) in order to easily investigate the effects of varying the bulkhead\n\n772\n\nthicknesses and linkage stiffness.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nA dis cuss ion of the reasons for applying substructuring to large corrplex\nstructures has been given. These reasons, when considered together, form a\nstrong argument for including such a capability in a general purpose program\nsuch as NASTRAN.

Harder*, Richard H. MacNeal*, and Robert V. Doggett, Jr.**\n*The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation\n**NASA Langley Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThis paper summarizes a study whose results are presented in detail in\nreference l. The purpose of the study was to define the modifications required\nto add aeroelastic capability to NASTRAN. A preliminary design for the new\ncapability was developed, including the subdivision of the task into functional\nmodules, the specifications of the mathematical content of the modules, and the\narrangement of modules into flow diagrams for new NASTRAN rigid formats. The\ndevelopment _ the preliminary design revealed the existence of a number of\nof\ncomputational problems to whose solution particu \xc2\xb7l ar attention was directed .\nThe mathematical and computational details of the stud~ are contained in\nreference 1.\nPRESENT NASTRAN CAPABILITIES\nThe NASTRAN digital computer program for structural analysis is a finite\nelement program with an extremely broad range of applications. Its problem\nsolving capabilities are, at present, separated into the following twelve\n"rigid formats," each of which entails a predetermined sequence of calculations\nthat are performed by "functional modules" under the control of a flexible\nexecutive system :\nStatic Analysis\nl.\n\n(Basic) Static Analysis\n\n2.\n\nStatic Analysis with Inertia Relief\n\n3.\n4.\n\nStatic Analysis with Differential Stiffness\nPiecewise Linear Analysis\n\nElastic Stability\n\n5.\n\nBuckling\n\nDynamics\n\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nVibration Mode Analysis\nDirect Complex Eigenvalue Analysis\nDirect Frequency and Random Response Analysis\n\n779\n\n9.\n\nDirect Transient Response Analysis\n\n10.\n\nModal Complex Eigenvalue Analysis\n\n11.\n\nModal Frequency and Random Response Analysis\n\n12.\n\nModal Transient Response Analysis\n\nIt will be noted that dynamic response and complex eigenvalue problems may\nbe solved either by a 11 direct 11 method or by a 11 modal 11 method. In a direct\nmethod the degrees of freedom are physical components of displacement. In a\nmodal method the degrees of freedom are generalized modal coordinates. Like\nal 1 other general purpose structural programs, NASTRAN employs the finite\nelement approach. The structural model that is analyzed consists of 11 elements 11\nsuch as beams, plates, and concentrated springs, that are connected together at\na finite number of 11 grid points . 11 The equilibrium equations of the niode f are\nex~ressed and solved in terms of the components of motion at grid points. The\nsolution of large problems, with hundreds or thousands of structural elements,\nis emphasized in thi design of NASTRAN. It is, in addition, a highly useroriented program with a large number of convenience features including automatic load generation, plotting, and restart capabilities. It also includes\nprovisions for incorporating nonstructural components, such as control systems,\nin the structural model.\n\xc2\xb7\nAt present, the solution of aeroelastic problems is accomplished in\nNASTRAN by means of 11 direct input 11 matrices which may be real or complex and\nwhich may be added to the structural mass, damping, or stiffness matrices and\nincluded in the solution of any of the seven dynamic rigid formats . This\nprovision is regarded as inadequate \xc2\xb7 for the followi ng reaso ns :\na.\n\nIt requires the use of separate computer programs for the generation\nof the aerodynamic input matrices, thereby causing delays and increasing the frequency of errors.\n\nb.\n\nIt places the burden of achieving geometric compatibility between the\naerodynamic forces and the structure entirely on the user of the\nprogram.\n\nc.\n\nIt provides very 1 ittle static aeroelastic capability and it automates\nnone of the specialized features of aeroelastic analysis, such as the\nselection of control surface deflections for trimmed flight, and the\nplotting of V-g flutter curves.\nOBJECTIVES\n\nThe purpose of the study was to define the modifications that will be\nrequired to make NASTRAN an effective tool for aeroelastic analysis. Due to\nits modular character, the addition of new capability to NASTRAN is not inherently difficult. The modifications required to add a particular new capability\nmay involve changes in existing functional modules, the generation of new\nfunctional modules, or the compilation of new rigid formats. All of these\nmeasures will be required to add aeroelastic capability.\n780\n\nOne of the major objectives of the study was to define an aeroelastic\ncapability for NASTRAN which will provide a degree of automation and a range\nof application comparable to that which presently exists for the solution of\npurely structural problems. Advanced aerodynamic configurations, such as the\nSpace Shuttle, indicate a need for a more soph;sticated approach to aeroelasticity in order to cope with the attendant structural and aerodynamic complexities. Our study of these matters has led to the following 1 ist of requirements\nfor a general purpose aeroelastic program:\n1.\n\nBroad Application\na.\nb.\n\nMany aerodynamic configurations\n\nc.\n\nSubsonic to hypersonic flow regimes\n\nd.\n\nMany classes of static and dynamic analysis\n\ne.\n2.\n\nMany types of structures\n\nCompatibility with other aspects of structural analysis, such as\nstress analysis, and control system interaction\n\nSophistication\na.\nb.\n\nAccurate and efficient computational procedures\n\nc.\n\n3.\n\nAbility to use advanced aerodynamic theories\nMany degrees of freedom\n\nAutomation\na.\nb.\n\n4.\n\nMinimum user effort, for both clerical and intellectual tasks\nCheckpoint and restart capabilities\n\nEase of modification to include new or improved features\n\nThe requirement for broad application is important from an economic viewpoint, because it reduces the number of separate computer programs, and, therefore, reduces development cost. It also eliminates the time that the user\nwould spend in learning to apply several separate programs, and in preparing\nseveral different sets of input data.\nThe qualities 1 isted under Sophistication and Automation are the qualities\nthat are usually associated with large user-oriented computer programs, and\nthey are now largely taken for granted in structural analysis, if not yet in\naeroelastic analysis. Ease of modification to include new or improved features\nis particularly important due to the long length of the development cycle for\nlarge scale computer programs, and the rapidity of recent technical progress.\nThe heart of an aeroelastic analysis is the theory used to calculate\naerodynamic forces, and the requirements listed above for the complete computer\nprogram can also, very largely, be applied to the selection of aerodynamic\ntheories. Since no existing theory has the desired range of application, the\n~l\n\nability to include several different aerodynamic theories, perhaps even in the\nsame problem, is recognized as a requirement. Advanced theories should be\nincluded, and also simple theories which are usually better from the standpoint\nof computational efficiency. One of the tasks undertaken in the study was to\ninvestigate candidate unsteady aerodynamic theories with respect to their range\nof application, accuracy, efficiency, user convenience, and general compatibility with a finite element approach to aeroelastic analysis.\nCLASSIFICATION OF AEROELASTIC PROBLEMS\nIt is expected that aeroelastic capability will be implemented in NASTRAN\nby a number of different rigid formats with names such as 11 Divergence, 11\n11\nFl utter, 11 and 11 Frequency Response 11 that correspond to different types of\nanalysis. A first task, before discussing the proposed measures for including\naeroelasticity in NASTRAN, is to classify aeroelastic problems according to \xc2\xb7\ntype of solution. The classification will be separated, for convenience, into\nstatic aeroelastic problems, flutter, and dynamic response problems.\nStatic Aeroelastic Problems\nA static aeroelastic problem may be defined as a problem involving the\nresponse of a flexible structure to aerodynamic loading in which terms proportional to the velocities and accelerations of the structare are assumed to be\ni ndepe nden t of t ime. Thus, ine r tia forces, if they enter at all, are assumed\nto be constant irr time. The three common types of static aeroelastic problems\nare\na.\n\nCalculation of static response, including loads and stresses in the\nstructure.\n\nb.\n\nCalculation of stability and control derivatives, i.e., the calculation of the changes in the aerodynamic loading (and, more particularly,\nof the changes in its resultants) due to small changes in the motions\nof the vehicle and of control surface deflections.\n\nc.\n\nDivergence, which is an idealized stability problem in which the\ndeterminant of the stiffness matrix, including both structural and\naerodynamic terms, vanishes.\n\nEach of the above static aeroelastic problems may be further classified as\nto whether the structure is supported or free to move. If it is free to move,\nthe inertia forces due to (steady) accelerations must be taken into account.\nAn additional distinction occurs in the determination of the static\nresponse of a freely movi~g structure, with respect to the manner in which the\nvelocity components and the control surface deflections of the structure are\ndetermined. In some cases the analyst specifies all of the components of\nvelocity and the control surface deflections and accepts whatever accelerations\n\n782\n\nthey produce. He may, on the other hand, request that some of the velocity\ncomponents and control surface deflections be evaluated so as to put the forces\non the vehicle into equi 1 ibrium, i.e., into a trimmed flight condition.\nThe general task of formulating and classifying static aeroelastic problems for solution in NASTRAN is addressed in Appendix B of reference l. It is\nshown there that all of the problem types mentioned above may be solved with\nthe following three rigid formats:\nAeroelastic Divergence\nUntrimmed Static Aeroelastic Response\nTrimmed Static Aeroelastic Response\nIn particular, the calculation of stability and control derivatives is\ntreated as a subcase of static , aeroelastic response.\nFlutter\nFlutter is the dynamic aeroelastic stability problem and it is appropriately analyzed as an eigenvalue problem. It is, however, a multiple eigenvalue\nproblem because the speed and altitude at which the oscillations become\nunstable are desired items of information. The unsteady aerodynamic forces are\nfunctions of reduced frequency (or Strouhal number), Mach number, air density,\nand perhaps of other parameters. A standard general approach to flutter\nanalysis is to evaluate the frequency of the oscillations and their damping\n(or equivalently the structural damping required to make them neutrally stable)\nfor different values of the parameters, and then to cross-plot the results to\nfind stability boundaries in the parameter space~ Several variations of the\ngeneral approach are explored in reference 1, resulting in the recommendation\nthat two different methods of flutter-eigenvalue analysis be implemented in\nNASTRAN. These methods, which are the conventional reduced frequency method\nand the Hassig P-K method, reference 2, can be implemented with the same rigid\nformats.\nThe ab i 1 i ty to have both 11 d i rect 11 and 11 moda l II methods of solution., noted\nearlier as an existing NASTRAN capability, is also important for flutter\nanalysis, although the modal method is usually more efficient. Separate\n11\ndirect 11 and 11 modal 11 rigid formats are proposed for flutter analysis.\nDynamic Response\nThe steady state response of an aeroelastic system to sinusoidal exc itation can provide the basis for the calculation of deflections and stresses due\nto loads caused by oscillatory vibration, random vibration, and transient\nexcitation . The frequency response calculation requires the solution of a\nsystem of simultaneous complex algebraic equations . The transfer functions\nthat result from the calculation can be used to compute the statistical properties of the response of 1 inear systems to stationary random excitation. In\n\naddition, Fourier integral transform theory provides the basis for using\nfrequency response data to compute the response of linear systems to transient\nexcitation.\nThe latter ability is particularly important for aeroelastic analysis\nbecause all advanced unsteady aerodynamic theories are formulated in the\nfrequency domain. Their conversion to the time domain in order to numerically\nintegrate the equations of motion appears to be prohibitively awkward unless\ngioss approximations are made. For this reason, the study concludes that\ntransient aeroelastic response calculation should be implemented by the Fourier\nIntegral Method only, at least initially.\nDynamic aeroelastic response, therefore, results in four NASTRAN rigid\nformats corresponding to frequency response analysis and transient response\nanalysis (by the Fourier Integral Method) using either a direct or a modal\nformulation. Random analysis is treated, as in the present NASTRAN rigid\nformats, as a subcase of frequency response.\nTHE MAJOR TASKS\nThe process of solving al inear aeroelastic problem with the aid of a\nstructural analysis computer program is conceived as consisting of the following steps:\n1.\n\nDefine the properties of the structure in terms of matrices of stiffness, mass and (perhaps) damping coefficients that refer to the components of motion at structural grid points (or to generalized modal\ncoordinates in a modal formulation).\n\n2.\n\nCompute a matrix of aerodynamic influence coefficients, relating\nforces to motions, at a set of aerodynamic control points.\n\n3.\n\nTransfer the aerodynamic influence coefficients to the structural\ngrid points (or to modal coordinates) and combine them with the\nstructural matrices.\n\n4.\n\nSolve the resulting matrix equations by whatever methods are appropriate for the type of results desired, e.g., by eigenvalue extraction\nfor a flutter analysis.\n\n5.\n\nRecover stresses, aerodynamic forces, etc., by means of equations\nrelating these quantities to the degrees of freedom evaluated in\nStep 4.\n\nIn the above 1 ist of steps,\nStep l requies no modification of NASTRAN;\nSteps 2 and 3 are wholly new;\n\n784\n\nStep 4 requires some new solution techniques to accommodate special\nfeatures of aeroelastic analysis;\nStep 5 requires modification of NASTRAN only to the extent of adding\nroutines to recover aerodynamic quantities.\n_\nMajor emphasis was placed, during the study, on formulating an approach for\nthe implementation of steps 2 and 3. The foremost objectives were to provide\na broad range of options with respect to configuration parameters and available theories, and to minimize user effcrt.\nStep 2 was divided into two tasks: first, subdivision of aerodynamic\nsurfaces into subregions (called aerodynamic elements) and the definition of\ntheir geometric properties; and second, the calculation of aerodynamic matrices\nfor the selected aerodynamic theories. By restricting the range of permitted\naerodynamic element shapes and orientations, the design of a module to perform\nthe first task is made independent of the second\xc2\xb7 task. The work required to\nadd new aerodynamic theories is thereby minimized for theories that conform\ngeometrically to the restrictions that are imposed. For this reason considerable attention was paid in the study to the geometric requirements of current\naerodynamic theories.\nStep 3 was divided into four tasks as fol lows, each performed by a\ndifferent functional module:\n\n3. 1 Generate a transformation matrix that linearly relates djsplacements\nat aerodynamic control points to displacements at structural grid\npoints. Calculation of the transformation matrix involves the use\nof interpolation procedures, for which a variety of options were\nproposed in the study.\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\nCompute aerodynamic matrices as seen at the structural grid points (or\nmodal coordinates) for a selected 1 ist of aerodynamic parameter sets\n(reduced frequency and Mach number), using the transformation matrix\nfrom task 3. 1, the aerodynamic matrices generated in step 2, and, if\nneeded, the matrix of structural eigenvectors.\nInterpolate the aerodynamic matrices to other values of the aerodynamic parameters.\n\n3.4 Combine the aerodynamic and structural matrices in the functional\nmodule that generates each particular type of solution.\nThe accomplishment of step 4, solution of matrix equations, will require\nnew routines for flutter analysis, divergence and static aeroelastic response.\nIn our judgement, the existing NASTRAN procedures are not adequate to accommodate the special features of these analysis types, although in all cases the\nnew routines resemble existing routines.\nThe effort required to formulate computational procedures for the above\ntasks resulted in some innovations that may be worthy of conside r ation in other\n\ncontexts. These include the use of elastic plates for surface interpolation,\nreference 1, appendix E, and the derivation of a kernel function, reference 3,\nthat permits extension of the subsonic aerodynamic theory known as the DoubletLattice Method, reference 4, to supersonic speeds.\nFLOW DIAGRAMS\nA computer program consists of a set of instructions that are organized to\nsolve a variety of mathematical problems. The problems themselves are described\nby parameter values supplied by the user of the program. The computational\ntask is subdivided into steps that are performed by discrete blocks of code\ncalled "Functional Modules." In NASTRAN, calls to functional modules are controlled by the "Executive System." A number of sequences of module calls,\ncal led "Rigid Formats," are stored in the program. Each rigid format is\ndesigned to solve a particular class of problems such as "Basic Static Analysis,"\n"Buckl ing, 11 "Modal Transient Response Analysis," etc.\nThe subdivision of computational steps into Functional Modules is arbitrary at least to the degree that the dividing points that they insert in the\nsequence of calculations can be placed arbitrarily. In some cases it is also\npossible to rearrange the order of calculations. Computational efficiency\n(and common sense) dictates the insertion of division points at places where\nthe data transmitted across the interfaces are minimal (NASTRAN requires that\nall data blocks transferred from one module to another be first placed in\nperipheral storage). Other factors, such as the requirement that restarts can\nonly be scheduled at the beginning of a module, or that certain calculations\nare useful in several different types of problems, influence the subdivision\ninto Functional Modules.\nThe subdivision of aeroelastic analysis into NASTRAN Functional Modules\nand Rigid Formats, as recommended by the study, is summarized in the following\nexhibits:\nTable 1:\n\nSimplified Flow Diagram for Dynamic Aeroelastic Analysis\n\nTable 1 presents a sequence of functional module calls for all forms\nof dynamic aeroelastic analysis. It also provides a very brief statement\nof the operations performed by each module and indicates whether the module\nis an existing module or a new module.\nTable 2:\n\nSimplified Flow Diagram for Static Aeroelastic Analysis\n\nTable 2 is analogous to Table 1.\n\n786\n\nTable 3:\n\nNew Functional Modules\n\nTable 3 lists the names of the new functional modules contained in\nTables 1 and 2 in three categories:\nA.\nB.\n\nModules used in both static and dynamic analysis.\nModules used only in dynamic analysis.\n\nC.\n\nModules used only in static analysis.\n\nTable 4:\n\nNew Rigid Formats\n\nTable 4 lists nine new rigid formats for the solution of aeroelastic\nproblems. Each rigid format corresponds to a particular type of aeroelastic analysis and, in the case of dynamic aeroelasticity, to a particular method of analysis. Additional rigid formats will b~ required for\ntransient analysis with aerodynamic forces represented directly in the\ntime domain, but this topic has not been researched sufficiently. The\ndifferen\xc2\xb7t rigid formats correspond to alternate paths in the flow diagrams of Tables 1 and 2, or to the deletion of some modules, or, in some\ncases, simply to alternate paths within modules. Separate rigid formats\nare provided for direct and modal dynamic analyses, which is consistent\nwith existing NASTRAN practice for structural dynamics. A separate rigid\nformat does not exist for the calculation of stability derivatives,\nbecause this task can be accomplished with Format No. BA, Untrimmed Static\nAeroelastic Response.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe addition of aeroelastic capability to NASTRAN is seen to be a sizeable\ntask involving the generation of nine new rigid formats and seventeen new\nfunctional modules. The magnitude of the task is inherent in the breadth of\nthe subject matter and in the requirements for automation and generality that\nwere assumed. NASTRAN itself is relatively easy to modify.\nThe question remains as to whether or not the recommendations of the study\nshould be implemented. The answer to this question depends in turn, on the\nanswers to the following three questions.\n1.\n\nIs there a requirement for an aeroelastic ana)ysis capability with the\ndegree of automation and the range of application that were assumed in\nthe study?\n\n2.\n\nDoes any existing computer program meet the requirements?\n\n3.\n\nIs NASTRAN the best program to use as a basis for the new capability?\n\nThe first question can be answered by even a brief examination of the\nconfigurations proposed for the Space Shuttle, all of which are characterized\nby a multiplicity of interfering aerodynamic surfaces and a high degree of\n\nstructural complexity. As was mentioned earlier, the examination of the aeroelast ic properties of the Space Shuttle and of other advanced configurations\ngenerated the list of requirements that were assumed in the study.\nThe answer to the second quegtion is that no computer program exists in\nthe public domain that even remotely approaches satisfaction of the requirements. The closest approach is probably the COFA series of computer programs\nfor flutter analysis, reference 5, developed under sponsorship of the Naval\nAir System Command, which includes capability for the entire Mach number range\nbut which is severely configuration limited.\nThe answer to the third question depends mostly on one\'s op1n1on of NASTRAN\nrelative to other available general purpose structures programs. Certainly\nthere can be little question that the modularity and sophistication provided by\ngeneral purpose programs are needed, or that the largest and most advanced\ngeneral purpose programs have been developed for structural analysis. NASTRAN\'s\nchief competitor would appear to be F0RMAT I I, reference 6, developed under\nAir Force sponsorship. It seems 1 ikely at this date that aeroelastic capability\nwill be added to both programs.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nHarder, R. L.; MacNeal, R. H.; and Rodden, W.

Practical experience is currently rather limited. It is anticipated that most immediate principal\napplications will be for stress analysis. This paper presents coding considerations for implementation of general isoparametric solids into a displacement method analysis program. The user interfaces (input and output)\nwith such a program are discussed. The thoughts presented herein have been\nor are being implemented into ATLAS, Boeing\'s integrated structural analysis\nand design program. No discussion of structural synthesis using solid\nelements is presented here, nor does this paper concern itself with axisymmetric elements or contain any new theoretical developments.\n\nI NTRODUCTION\nA constant strain tetrahedron was introduced by Argyris (ref. 1) in\nGeneral solid elements using three degrees of freedom per node include the 4 corner tetrahedron, the 6 corner wedge and the 8 corner brick\n(fig. 1) with nodes coinciding with the corners as well as higher order\nelements with additional nodes along the edges, on the boundary surfaces or\nin the interior. General elements with more than three degrees of freedom\nper node have also been introduced, see ref. 2. Such elements will not be\nconsidered in this paper. Reference 3 contains a recent state-of-the-art\nreview of solid elements and a comparison of some isotropic tetrahedra and\nhexahedra. This reference points out clearly the advantage of elements with\nvarying strain capability over those with constant strain for stress analysis.\nThis effect is more pronounceQ in three- than in two-dimensional problems.\n\n1965.\n\nThe family of isoparametric solid elements represents the current\nstate-of-the-art for three-dimensional analysis, using the displacement\nmethod with translational freedoms only. (In this paper, "isoparametric"\nconnotes shape functions identical to coordinate mapping functions and\nthus includes volume coordinate representations). All but the simplest of\nthe members of this family are capable of inclusion of varying strain.\nThey all have an inherent monotonic convergence to the true solution\n(assuming no numerical problems) and the element derivation is concise and\nelegant and lends itself to a powerful, general purpose coding. The use of\nnumerical integration should be considered only a minor disadvantage that\n\n797\n\ncan be offset by efficient coding but the ability of higher order members of\nthe family to conform accurately to curved boundaries is a major asset.\nFor the initial implementation of solid elements into NASTRAN, the\nisoparametric brick, tetrahedron and wedge should be chosen (in that order\nof priority). The coding should be arranged to recognize commonalities\nbetween the different topological types and the principles of the "deviation\nfrom linearity" technique should be used for easy implementation of higher\norder elements. Generation CF-times are relatively high for these elements\nand major areas of CP-time consumption (c9ngruent transformations) should\nbe identified and coded as separate, general routines that can be replaced\nwith FORTRAN callable routines coded in assembly language which can reduce\nthe run time by recognizing the particular hardware characteristics. This\nprinciple applies to all types of element generation but is becoming more\nimportant for higher order isoparametric solid elements.\nAlthough it is assumed throughout this paper that the reader is familiar\nwith isoparametric elements, some derivations for the 8 vertex brick are\ncontained in Appendix A to establish referenceable notations. The ideas\npresented in this paper are applicable to all solid isoparametric elements\nbut expressed specifically for the 8 corner brick.\nNOTATIONS\n\nB\n\nMatrix transforming elemental nodal displacements into strain\n\nD\n\n6 x 6 matrix transforming strain into stress in local (material)\nreference frame\n\nD\'\n\n6\n\n6 matrix transforming strain into stress in global reference\nframe\n\nf\n\nMatrix of body force loads\n\nI\n\nUnit matrix\n\nJ\n\nJacobian matrix (3 x 3)\n\nK\n\nElemental stiffness matrix, transforming elemental global\ndisplacements into elemental global loads\n\nN\n\nMatrix of displacement shape functions\n\nx\n\nDisplacement shape function\nBody force interpolation matrix\nSurface load interpolation matrix\n\nNt\n\nThermal load interpolation matrix\n\nEO\n\nN\n\nInitial strain interpolation matrix\n\np\n\nM\natrix of surface loads\n\nR\n\nElem\nental structural nodal loads\n\nRf\n\nNodal loads equivalent to body forces\n\nRp\n\nNodal loads equivalent to surface loads\n\nRt\n\nNodal loads equivale nt to thermal loads\n\nRE\n\nNodal loads equivalent to initial strain\n0\n\nr\n\nMatrix of elemental nodal global displacements\n\nr\'\n\nM\natrix of elemental nodal local displacements\n\nr.\n\nElemental nodal global displacements in the x. direction\n\nT\n\nCoordinate transformation\n\nt\n\nMatrix of thermal loads\n\nl\n\nu.\nl\n\nk\n\nl\n\nmatrix\n\nDisplacement in the x. direction\n].\n\nu.\n].\n\nNodal value (at node k) of u .\n\nw\n\nIntegration weights\n\nx.\n].\n\nGlobal coordinate\n\na\n\na\n\ne\n\n].\n\ne\n\n- 8 is number of edge nodes\n\na. - a\nl\n\na\n\ns\n\n- a\n\nS\n\ne\n\nis number of interior nodes\nis number of boundary surface nodes\n\ns\n\nMatrix expressing deviations from "earlier displacements",\nsee appendix A\n\ny\n\nMatrix transforming r into r\'\n\nE\n\nMatrix of elemental strain\n\nE\n0\n\nMatrix of initial strain\n\ns.\n\nLocal coordinate\n\nn\n\nMatrix of thermal expansion coefficients\n\n].\n\n799\n\nMatrix of element stresses\n\nCT\nCT\n\nm\n\nStress matrix\nCODING ORGANIZATION\n\nThere are three areas of major concern for the coding of matrix\ngeneration for solid isoparametric elements. They are (a) the number of\narithmetic opera~ions involved, particularly for the congruent matrix\ntransformation B D\'B that is required at each integration point of the\nstiffness matrix generation; (b) the amount of core storage required for\nhigher order members of the family of solid elements that may make the\ngeneration phase core storage critical (which it may be anyhow) if the\ntraditional (and simplest) approach with a core contained generation is\nused; (c) the desire to be as general as possible by recognizing commonalities between different solid elements and organize a library of "element\ngeneration support routines". To illustrate\xc2\xb7 points (a) and (b) above let\nus examine how I!la.)1,Y ~tiplications and words of storage the congruent\ntransformations y ( B D\'B) y require if we disregard matrix sparseness.\n\n8-node\n\n20-node\n\n32-node\n\nN mult\n\n40000\n\n680000\n\n3300000\n\n6600 CP time\n\n.3 s\n\n4\n\n20s\n\nStorage\n\n1500\n\n7500\n\nN int. points\n\n8\n\ns\n\n27\n\n20000\n64\n\nFor timing purposes etc., values typical for a Control Data 6600 computer\nwill be used through this paper. The central processor (CP) times are\ncomputed assuming 6 microseconds (\xc2\xb5s ) /mult and add for matrix multiplications which is typical for FORTRANTgenerated code. The storage is what\nis required to hold D\', B, y, K, B D\'B in core simultaneously. It is quite\nobvious from the table that both the storage requirement and the computer\ntime increase rapidly with the number of nodes. It is also quite obvious\nthat an integration technique should be used which requires as few integration points as possible for a certain level of accuracy. Gauss\' method\n(ref. 4) meets this requirement.\nTo decrease the computer CP-time there are two possible improvements\nto make: avoid zero operations and use assembly code for the most critical\noperations. The number of non-zero multiplications is approximately 50%\nof the total number (B and y are approximately "half-populated") and the\nCP-time per multipli cation can be reduced to 1 \xc2\xb5s/mul t with appropriate\n\n800\n\nCOMPASS code. Thus the CF-time reductions due to fast "inner loops" in\nthe matrix multiply operations are much more pronounced than those of\ncoding for non-zero "custom-made"* arithmetic. For this reason and because\nthe assembly-coded routines will be more generally applicable, they should\nbe preferred to "custom-made" FORTRAN code. However, a vector innerproduct subroutine will still be less than optimum since the inner products\nare very short for the bulk of the operations (6 or 3 depending upon if\nzeros are recognized or not) and calling times of 20-30 \xc2\xb5s are typically\nrequired for such subroutines, Therefore a FORTRAN-callable routine to\nmultiply a matrix by a vector should be used.\nNo out-of-core generation should presently be considered for the\nreasons that: (1) the performance of higher order elements is now known\nwell presently and they may prove to have in some cases the deficiencies\nthat least square fits with higher order polynomials quite often display\n(2) analyses using higher order solids will normally require so much\narithmetic that they will be performed on hardware on which sufficient\ncore should be available. However,the allocation of core for the elemental\nmatrices should be dynamic (typically using the FORTRAN idea of blank\ncommon) to allow for execution on smaller core when lower order elements\nare used,\nTo make the code for stiffness matrix generation as general as possible\nthe following steps should be recognized:\nl,\n\nSet up vectors of integration coordinates and weights\n\n2.\n\nSet up D\' = T\n\n3,\n\nFor each integration point,\n\n-l\n\nDT\n\nclN.\n\n3a.

Establish B\n3d, Add EBTD\'B\n\n4.\n\nFinally after the loop compute\nK = yT(IBTD\'B)y\n\nThe number of integration points (which may be different in different\ndirectioqs) should be set to default values that are consistent with the\nelement order. The user should have the option to overrule these default\nvalues, Successful numerical integration using only a few integration\npoints has been reported (ref. 4).\n\n*\n\n"custom-made" means that the code is organized t o recognize the particular features of the problem, i.e. locations of zeros in matrices, etc.\n801\n\nUse of fewer points for the shear term contributions is not recommended\nsince it is undesirable to bias an element intended for general application\ntoward any strain energy component.\nFor other types of isoparametric elements, only step 3a of the proposed\ncoding sequence needs to be modified in essence. Further it is noted that\nvariable material properties are available by forming D\' (step 2) inside\nthe integration loop (step 3).\nSix rows of the stress matrix are obtained from the matrix product DTBy,\nwhere the B-matrix (and D, if variable material properties are used) must\nbe evaluated at the point where the stresses are to be determined. This\nia done simply by coding step 3 of the stiffness matrix generation so that\nc)L~.\n\na~~ may be obtained at any point.\n\nThe coding in steps 4 and 5 then apply\n\ndi~ectly to the stress matrix generation. As a default option, stresses\nshould be generated at the corner nodes (48 stress components); but,\nevaluation at other points should also be available at the user\'s option.\nEquivalent nodal load matrices should be generated using\nshape functions to describe the loading that are used for the\nFor most practical applications there are relatively few load\nthe nodal load matrices should be kept inside the summation,\nis performed as for the stiffness matrix generation.\n\nthe same\ndisplacements.\ncases and\nIntegration\n\nDynamic core allocation is recommended both for stress matrices and\nequivalent nodal loads matrices.\n\nINPUT\nConvenient input data formats are important for any structural analysis\nprogram. The problem of devising simple but powerful formats is particularly pronounced for (higher order) solid elements since only a few elements\nsuffice to describe the total structure and each element will require a\nsubstantial amount of information, Many users think this information should\nbe determined by the program itself, In this section we shall study the 8\ncorner brick element with edge nodes only but what is stated applies in\nprinciple to other bricks and to tetrahedra and wedges as well. Both direct\nelement input requirements and some thoughts on a grid generator for solid\nelements are presented. Data generation by modified repetition etc. is\nnaturally desired and normally available in a state-of-the-art program but\ndoes not apply to solid elements in particular and will not be discussed.\nDirect Input\nFor stiffness matrix generation one needs the element type, its user\nidentification, node numbers and material data (code, property orientation\nand temperature). Input formats for this except the node list are trivial.\nThe list of nodes should begin with the eight corner nodes in the order\n\n802\n\ndefined in fig. 2 and contain additional nodes if t here are nodes on one or\nmore edges of the brick. The following formats of nodal input are proposed:\n1)\n2)\n3)\n\n... , NB,\n... , NB,\n\np\np\np\nNE \' NE\' \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2.\' NE\n1\n2\n12\nNodes on E , N , Nodes on E , N ,\nNl, N2\'\n1\n2\n2\n3\nNodes on E , N.\n12\nl\nNl\' N2\' \xe2\x80\xa2.. \' NB RNC\nNl\' N\n2\'\n\n... \'\n\nwhere N , \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 , N denote corner nodes; E , \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 , E\nstand for edge 1\n1\n8\n12\nthrough edge 12 (with directions defined, see !ig. 2).\nIn 1) there are\nexactly p nodes in each set N~- (p = O, \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 ). Thus the total number of\nnodes input is 8 + 12p.\n\nZe ro ~nd fill in N~- is used to degenerate the edge\n\nto a lower order form. In the second formatlwhich uses delimiters (the end\ncorner of the edge) zero fill within the edge node lists is not allowed.\nThe program should distinguish between formats 1 and 2 by checking for occurrence of corner nodes in the nodes following N . Format 3) contains\n8\nonly corner nodes and a radius ~C (real) which instructs the program to\ninclude all nodes enclosed within a cylinder with the given radius along\nstraight lines defining the edges.\nIf non-default stress generation is desired (default is stresses\nwith respect to material axes at the eight corners), additional information is needed. Available optiona would be stresses computed at any node\nor at any specified coordinate (global). In each case 6 stress components\nwill be computed at each user specified point and in the order they are\nspecified by the user (order of rows of the stress matrix). Input of\nstress generation information should be done in a separate record in which\nnode numbers (integers) are mixed with triplets of floating point numbers.\nThe program should distinguish the type of the number input.\nElement loading input is more complex. Primarily due to the input\nvolume, it should not be contained in the basic element input record.\nThermal loads, initial strains and body force loads require exactly as\nmany values per load case as there are nodes (input in the nodal data\norder). One input value by default refers to constant loads (strains)\nwhile 8 input values refer to the corner nodes and imply that the basic\ncorner shape functions should be used as load interpolation functions.\nSurface loading is input as nodal values surface by surface. The surface\nis identified by an integer between 1 and 6 and the nodal values are input\naccording to edge order (from lower to higher, last node on edge not included). For any one load component, there should be default options of\none or four values available indicating constant load or load at the four\ncorners. Loading values refer to intensities per actual area of the surface.\nDue to the large amount and complexity of input data for solid brick\nelements, it is important to define and implement as many data checks as\npossible. Such checks would include tests for\n\n803\n\n(a) reentrant corners and warping of the 6 quadrilaterals formed\nby the eight corners\n(b) determining that intermediate edge nodes fall within a user\ndefined cylinder between corner nodes\n(c) determining that each element defined is topologically\nfeasible (has a single interior)\n(d) determining that points where stresses are to be computed\nlie on or within the element\nGrid Generator\nA typical feature of input data for solid elements is that many of the\nnodes are not used to define the geometrical configuration of the structure\nbut rather to obtain a certain refinement of the results. Thus a grid\ngenerator for solid elements should prove to be very efficient. The user\nonly needs to input the surface geometry and the desired grid refinement\nand the grid generator can then produce nodal and elemental data. If a\ngrid generator is used for nodes and elements, it is imperative that it be\nextended to element loads, nodal loads and boundary constraints as well;\nsince the user loses control over details of the produced data. Some work\nhas been in progress within Boeing over the past year to generate data for\nsolid finite element analysis. Currently a simple grid generator for\n8-node bricks is available. The basic principle used is that any body that\nis topologically equivalent to a brick can be assigned a rectangular user\ngrid (and thereby "userbrick" elements) to define its geometry. Within\neach "userbrick" the nodal refinement and any nodal loads may be defined.\nKnown deficiencies are the requirement of topological equivalence to a\ncube, that grid refinements do not utilize higher order elements and that\na grid generator is not very useful unless there is a post processor\navailable for the results, since there is no detail user control over node\nand element numbers,\n\nOUTPUT\nPreparation of input data for analysis with solid elements is quite\ncumbersome but the interpretation and use of the output (primarily\nstresses) is even more so if non-selective printout of stress components\nin global coordinates is the only available option. Selective display\nof stress data is necessary for efficient analysis of solids, at least\nthis is strongly indicated by recent experience within The Boeing Company.\nIf a grid generator is used for data preparation, selective output for\ngeometrically defined regions is imperative.\nThe reason that extraction of stresses is the most valuable output\nfeature is the fact that no or little additional processing is needed\nfor the stresses. However other options such as computation and display\n\n804\n\nof principal stresses and their directions would also be valuable. Of\nparticular interest is the employment of some yield or failure criteria\nsuch as Hill\'s yield function (ref. 5) to allow for a computerized search\nfor critical conditions. To simplify fatigue analysis it would be useful\nto have the program find the maximum tensile stress in certain surfaces\nof the structure.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n"Matrix Analysis of Three Dimensional Elastic Media, Small and Large\nDisplacements", Argyris, J.

G. Butler\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nINTRODUCTION\nEven in the face of a prodigious amount of structural\nanalysis capability by finite element methods, some organizations are generating new programs which essentially duplicate\nthe characteristics of current programs.\nThe purpose of this\npaper is to examine the effects of proliferation. Arguments\nare presented which will show that the benefits derived from a\nreduction in proliferation result in better communication,\nreduced cost, and increased dissemination of capability.\nLarge finite element programs are expensive to generate\nbecause they contain great volumes of code.\nTechnology is moving\nso fast in the mechanics of finite elements, in numerical analysis\nin finite fields, and in computer hardware and software, that\nthese large finite element programs rapidly become outdated.\nThe combinations of paths through large programs are so great that\nwe can say that they will never be fully checked out, so they\nare constantly in need of servicing as usage broadens.\nTo stay\nabreast of technology changes and error discoveries, large finite\nelement programs should be maintainable and should be maintained\nin order to achieve user confidence.\nMaintenance is costly but\nmuch less so than complete program replacement in both dollars and\ntime.\nAnything that would compound the cost of providing finite\nelement analysis capability to the structural community would be\nconsidered undesirable; therefore, proliferation is bad.\nThere\nare many other factors besides cost that would determine an attitude\ntoward proliferation, but cost is a sufficient basis.\nBefore we can champion a cause, we have to get definition of\nit.\nWhat constitutes proliferation of finite element programs\nin the eyes of structural analysts?\nIf a known capability exists\nand an effort is initiated to duplicate that capability, there\nis proliferation so long as there is not something unique that is\nbeing offered with respect to the following general characteristics:\n\n813\n\nProblem size\nObject of the analysis\n\nf Special\nGeneral\n\\_\n\npurpose\npurpose\n\nMethod of approach\nSolution capability\nMode of operation\n\nf Applications\n\n\\_ Experimentation\n\nAccurac y\nEfficiency\nConvenience\nLet us also get a definition of proliferation from a negative\nsense. In no wise is there an implication that existing programs that are in use which have overlapping capability constitute proliferation in the sense of this discussion. Programs\nsuch as Boeing\'s SAMECS, Jet Propulsion Lab\'s SAMIS, or Wright\nField\'s FORMAT have been in use long enough to have proven themselves as production tools. In terms of efficiency for certain\nt ypes of problems it would take analysts, who have become expert\nat operating these existing programs, much longer to convert\nto a new program than to continue using those with wh ich they are\nfamiliar . Only when analytical needs exceed the capabilities of\nthe older programs should the analyst be coaxed toward programs\nwith prospects for extensive longevity. It becomes proliferation\nonly when attempts are made to put new capability into programs\nthat are not readily maintainable. Programs with limited capability which are costly to modernize should be allowed to phase\nout in favor of the maintainable programs when the technological\nadvancements render them out - of-date.\nMAINTAINABILITY\nThe policy which I hope to convince you of is that with a\ngood, modular, maintainable program any characteristic which is\nfound to be insufficient can be arighted by directly modifying\nthe offending portion. Since this is a NASTRAN User\'s Colloquium,\nit is forgivable if we examine the suitability of this policy\nwith respect to NASTRAN as being representative of a good, modular, maintainable program. Its suitability will be examined\naccording to the above set of characteristics.\n\n814\n\nProblem Size\nRight now NASTRAN does a creditable job handling problems\nfrom 100 to 10,000 degrees of freedom. For problems under 100\ndegrees of freedom the overhead cost of arraying the large amount\nof general purpose software onto the computer and stepping through\nthe options accounts for over 95% of the central processing unit\n(CPU) charge time.\nIf one is confronted with heavy traffic in\nsmall sized jobs it would definitely pay to abandon a general\npurpose program and go to a special purpose program. The overhead\ncost of NASTRAN on various sizes of computers is tabulated as\nfollows:\nComputer\n\nCPU Overhead Time\n\nIBM 360 Model 95\n\n20 Sec\n\nIBM 360 Model 85\n\n20 Sec\n\nIBM 360 Model 75\n\n35 Sec\n\nIBM 360 Model 65\n\n52 Sec\n\nIBM 360 Model 50\n\n217 Sec\n\nCDC 6600\n\n12 Sec\n\nCDC 6400\n\n18 Sec\n\nUNIVAC 1108\n\n17 Sec\n\nA problem in statics or eigenvalues for a small problem of less\nthan 100 degrees of freedom using a special purpose program\nshould take about 3 seconds on the 360/95. General purpose programs cannot compete with special purpose programs on small sized\nproblems.\nFor very large problems a computer strategy of breaking\nthe problem up into pieces and condensing the pieces before joining them to represent the total structure is called structural\npartitioning. Experimental versions of structural partitioning\nfor NASTRAN are already working, so the extensions to very large\nsized problem is already established for both statics and dynamics.\nType of Computer\nThe scheme for making NASTRAN adaptable to many different\ncomputers was to make the program modular. Some modules deal\nonly with the management of the program and are called executive\n\n815\n\nmodules, while other modules deal with the operation of the\nsolution process and are called functional, mathematical, and\nutility modules. All except some of the executive modules are\nmachine independent, so the problem of adapting NASTRAN to a\nnew computer is to rewrite only certain of the executive modules\nwhich are machine dependent. The feasibility for making an\nadaption was demonstrated in the pilot conversion that was done\nfor the IBM 360 Model 67 computer operating under time sharing\noperating system. The adaptability is further being attested\nby the work that is currently underway to convert NASTRAN to\nthe Honeywell 635 computer. Active interest is being shown in\nadapting it also to the Xerox Sigma class of computers.\nObject of the Analysis\nA program can be designed for general purpose operation or\nfor special purpose solutions. NASTRAN is obviously already a\ngeneral purpose program, and, if it is not already obvious, it\nwill be amply shown subsequently that it can be extended into\nfurther generalization. The real question is what can we do\nabout special purpose needs? Can one truncate the program?\nCan one strip out the options? The answer to both of these ques tions is yes. Take for example, the need for a special purpose\nsub program to solve truss-like statics problems for large bridges\ndescribed in rectangular coordinates, subject to point force loads\nat grid points only. The source code would be culled of all executive control functions except restart. The case control would\nretain only labelling; subcases for regulating: load sets,\nboundary sets, multi-point constraint sets, output sets of forces,\ndisplacements, and stresses; and plots of only rod elements. The\nexecutive routines would be reduced to a skeleton amount of input\ndata checking, a fixed assignment of data blocks to discs and\ntapes instead of dynamic assignment, a fixed OSCAR (operating\nsequence control array) with a few variable flags instead of\nvariable arrays, and a small parameter table. The bulk data cards\nwould consist of a GRID, a CONROD, a MAT 1, a FORCE, an SPC, an\nMPC, a delete, and an OMIT. The organization into links would\nbe abandoned but an overlay structure would probably be kept.\nThe beauty of having the rigid formats written in DMAP\nlanguage is that the logic of reducing the program to special\npurpose form can be tested by operating it in the environment\nof the existing general organization by using ALTER cards to\neliminate batches of operations. Plot routines would be kept,\nbut their framework would be whittled to necessities. Analysts\ninvolved in production-like repetitive analyses of the same\ntype may want to do a scaling down operation like this as a\nroutine matter.\n\n8~\n\nThere is even another kind of special reduction in which\na given structure is frozen into the program and the only variability that is retained is in the type of load or the solution\ncase type. Thus all sorts of unneeded data checking routines\nand decomposition routines could be eliminated in favor of\nload vector formation and forward-backward pass operations.\nRecapitulating then, it is possible to strip out generality\nfrom the code to reduce some portions to a minimum of operations\nand options. The remaining portions of the code could successfully function in special purpose form to gain the advantages\nof tailored programs.\nMethod of Approach\nProvision was made originally in NASTRAN to solve finite\nelement problems by the displacement method, the force method,\nand by DMAP (direct matrix abstraction). One whole link is\nstill reserved for the force method that never did get integrated. If a new force method such as an approach via stress\nfunctions were developed it could be incorporated by locating\nit in the reserved force link or by adding entirely new links,\nbecause the organization is open-ended with respect to links.\nEntries would have to be made in executive tables and to output processors, but these tables and processors are also openended. This implies that distinct new approaches to finite\nelement analysis can be added or existing ones can be replaced\nby improved ones because of the modularity and open-endedness\nto the overall program design.\nSolution Capability\nIf a better method of decomposition is found, if an improved\neigenvalue routine appears, or if a differential equation i n tegration routine has a special feature, one of two possibilities\ncan be invoked in each instance. The existing routine can be\nreplaced by the candidate routine within the respective modules\nor new logic can be introduced to allow an option between the\nexisting routine and the added capability. The second alternative will involve additional new entries in case control and\nbulk data. The fact to note here is that the new routines can\nbe entered without disturbing the code outside of the module.\nTurning our attention to the next level of complexity above\na subroutine to a module, it is possible to replace modules\nwithout disturbing any other part of the program. Each module\nhas a prescribed interface with the executive only and definitely\neschews any interaction with any other module . A module c an be\ndrastically overhauled and will cause no repercussions outside\nof this module so long as the replacement module retains the\n\nsame inte rface with the executive that the previous module did.\nA particularly convenient facility called a dummy module has\nbeen provided in NASTRAN to test out a new module within the\nNASTRAN environment without disrupting anything. All entries\nfor dummy modules have been made in tables and lists. When a\nmodule is ready to be tested, the symbolic dummy entries are\nreplaced by named quantities pertaining to the new module.\nIn this test mode, the final grooming can be worked on with\nimpugnity. Its ultimate performance after integration can be\nprecisely predicted from its performance in the dummy module\nmode.\nGoing back now to the topic of routines, there is a new\ncapability being developed called a Dummy Element. Input cards,\ntable entries, parameter entries, material calls, and plot calls\nwill all have symbolic dummy entries. This will soon allow\na new element routine to be added or be substituted in a fashion\nsimilar to the dummy module by simply providing named quantities for the symbolic dummy entries at the time of inserting\nthe element routine code. Element routines are the only routines\nbeing provided for testing in a specific dummy fashion. If one\ndesires to test other routines in dummy fashion the module for\nwhich it is destined can be copied except for the new routine\nand be operated as a separate dummy module so that the new and\nold can be directly compared.\nAt the highest level of complexity a complete rigid format\n(i.e. a structural case type) can be created and can be entered\nas an additional solution string. The number of rigid formats\nlike many other systems in NASTRAN is open-ended. DMAP language\nis used to write the rigid format operations. Entries are made\nin the executive solution table, the executive module property\nlist, and the catalog of restart options is put in. All of\nthese new features operate distinctly from any other solution\nstrings, so they can be added or deleted with freedom.\nAs proof of this power to add rigid formats, the ability\nto solve hydro-elastic problems was implemented as several new\nrigid formats. Aero-elasticity solutions are being contemplated\nas several more. Thermal analyzer modules may eventually occupy\nover five rigid formats. Existing rigid formats will be revamped\nto include structural partitioning. What is indicated here is\nsolid activity in replacing and augmenting the number of rigid\nformats, proving that the claim to maintainability is really so.\nMode of Operation\nPrograms can usually be classified as either for applications work or for developmental work. Some excellent development work is being carried out at the University of Wales, Brown,\n\n818\n\nLiege, Cornell, Vermont, Ar i zona , Hawaii, M.I. T., and California.\nMost of the well known programs, however , are applications type.\nIt was the intention also that NASTRAN be an application program; but because of its link structure, a link can be devoted\nentirely to developmental purpos es without imped ing any of the\napplications features. A link can be organized to have counter part operations overlaid at the same level wi th an option to\nchoose between them for comparison purposes. All of the applications links will be entirely insensitive to all of the features\nwithin the experimental link. Therefore, unless the experimentation would involve executive operations, NASTRAN can readily\nprovide a handy vehicl e for module experimentation, and thus\nobviate the expense of generating experimental programs.\nI must not overlook the impractical aspects of using NASTRAN\nas an experimental program in its present form. There is an\nexpensive, fixed overhead in its present form. It would be folly\nto exercise the whole program in an experimental mode for an\nextensive schedule of experimental work.\nIt would be better\nto strip the unnecessary routines out of the executive to minimize the overhead, and to condense all operations into a single\nlink program for conserving storage space. In some respects\nthe distilling of an experimental version from the complete\nprogram is akin to separating out of a special purpose program.\nThe amount of work to extract an experimental version from\nNASTRAN is much smaller than writing an entirely new program\nand worry through a check-out phase.\nA distinct mode of operation within the realm of applications programs, is the on-line, direct-interaction mode\noperating from a cathode ray scope command terminal. There\nis no techni cal impediment to wards adapting NASTRAN to an online mode. M y is needed to subsidize such capability, but\none\nprior to this, a design study should be conducted in order to\ndetermine (a) the suitability of relative sizes of core residency between the scope graphics and the analysis program, (b)\nthe degree of antiquity of recallable, prior analyses, (c) and\nthe organization of scope displays for rapid interpretation\nand subsequent analysis commands. Such on-line operation is\nthe apogee toward wh ich a completely general purpose program\nshould aim.\nHere we have shown that the link/overlay/modular construction allows for adjusting to a desired mode of operation.\nAccuracy\nThere are times when routines or modules have poor convergence properties except for particular ranges of parameter\nvalues . There is continual activity t o r emove these imperfections.\n\n819\n\nWhen algorithms with improved accuracy are perfected a proper\ncourse of action would be to expedite its incorporation into\nappropriate modules of a maintainable program like NASTRAN.\nIt is insupportable to make an isolated advancement in the\nstate of the arts the basis to launch into a competitive or\nredundant venture. Recent activities along these lines to\ncreate all new code are unjustified and should be interdicted.\nEfficiency\nLarge, maintainable programs are being scrutinized from\nmany different points of view. The multiplicity of paths\nversus the independent range of parameter values can produce\ninstances of sluggishness. Such instances should be rectified\nand not be made occasions of scorn. The stamp of inefficiency\ncan be affixed to an algorithm when improvements in numerical\nanalysis or supporting software admit of designs of swifter\nexecution. In this event the module containing the offending\ncode should be replaced with due haste. There is current\nactivity along these lines in NASTRAN. Inefficiencies in\nplotting, matrix packing, reading a matrix into core, and multiplications are being attended with consequent individual running time reductions by factors of 2 up to 10 and in combination as high as 40. Such instances are not surprising. In fact\nit is expected that attention to efficiency will be a continuing\nmaintenance activity.\nConvenience\nNeeds of analysts in organizing input data, in successive\nmanipulations of incremental solutions, and in the production\nof plots are as mutable as slang in a modern language. Dissatisfaction with an existing method of treating a situation is\nno cause for abandoning a maintainable program in favor of the\ndevelopment of a new program. The very word maintainable\nimplies that replacements are possible and economically feasible.\nUsing NASTRAN as an example again, a basic policy was\ndecreed towards generation of input data. The format of bulk\ndata input was to be as convenient yet general as possible.\nOn the other hand automatic generation of input data was not\nto be made part of the basic program. Generator programs were\nto be auxilliary and separate. The rationale behind this policy\nwas an attempt to keep things manageable. NASTRAN was a sizeable\ntask to manage without having to burden it with data process or s .\nMore important, however, was the prospect that small generat or\nprograms were expected to spring up frequently and would very\nlikely have short lives. Rather than incorporate these programs\ninto the mainbody of NASTRAN and require a link editing of the\n820\n\noverlay structure every time one of them became supplanted,\nit appeared much more logical to require these generator programs to be distinct entities that would be simple to operate.\nReturning to the topic of convenience within the program,\nthere has been a recent rash of improvements in diagnostics.\nA major revision of curve plotting has been proposed to give\nmore versatility . A modification to the eigenvalue rigid\nformat to allow multiple subcases for boundary value changes\nhas been put forward. All such convenience features and service code are readily implementable because of the modular nature\nof NASTRAN. Constant attention to items of convenience will\nbring about remarkable streamlining.\nHopefully, it has been demonstrated that a large general\npurpose program like NASTRAN is maintainable in each of the\ncategories deemed important. Thus it should be possible to\nstay abreast of the state-of-the-arts by continual enhancement\nof a maintainable program without having to recreate entirely\nnew programs as technology advances.\nBENEFITS\nOne of the strongest arguments to inhibit duplication of\neffort is the amount of direct benefit that would be derived.\nThe argument is based on the assumption that finite element\nstructural analysis is needed and that the many different\norganizations which do analysis would have access to the generally accepted programs.\nThe first benefit would be in communication. Engineers\nworking on the same mission and doing analysis with the same\nprogram can feed data between each other in situations where\none analysis needs to have information supplied from several\nsources. An example of this would be a vibration analysis of\na space mission launch configuration. The vibration analyst\ncould draw on analysts who had used the common program to study\nthe rocket, the spacecraft, the shroud, and the experiments\nmounted within the spacecraft. Models of each of these components could already have been on magnetic tape. The vibration analyst need only read the structural modelling data from\nthe tape resulting from each portion of the launch configuration and add a few control cards to his computer run to do an\nanalysis for finding the important frequencies and mode shapes\nof the entire structure at launch. To make things go smoothly\nit would be well to anticipate such an overall analysis so\nthat the interface compatibility conditions could be provided\nfor in advance of the final analysis. General Purpose programs\nwhich are adaptable to many computers can provide this communication vehicle.\n821\n\nThe second benefit would be cost savings. Big, general\npurpose, finite element programs are expensive to build and\nto maintain. Rather than have each organization that does\nanalysis bear the cost of developing its own finite element\nprogram and continue to pay for maintenance, a well subsidized,\nsingle development and maintenance effort to provide a program that meets the requirements of the individual organizations, would suppress the unnecessary duplication of expense.\nThere can be an obverse to this expense picture in that organizations can save their fellow organizations new development\ncosts. Consider the situation in which a program in wide use\nhas a published program of planned enhancement. Consider also\nan organization that has need of a capability earlier than it\nis scheduled in the enhancement plan. If this organization\nwere to accelerate the development of the subject capability\nby doing it or paying to have it done in time for its own use,\nthis cost could be amortized against the budget for the mission\nneeding the analysis. This added capability could then be\ndonated to the general program for distribution to all users,\nthus freeing funds, earmarked for this particular capability,\nto be reassigned to augment some other facet of the program.\nThe third benefit would be the rapid dissemination of\nadvancements in analytical tools. Many active program developers might consider this dissemination a handicap rather than\na benefit. Let me frame the argument for dissemination on\nthe basis of what our Ad Hoc Group found when it canvassed\nthe aerospace industry in 1964. Most programs were proprietary\nin 1964 and each company was anxious to hoard its advantage.\nAs a result each company\'s program had some remarkably attractive features, but each also had a great many defects, considering all three disciplines. The whole aerospace industry\nsuffered from analyses not being up to their full potential,\nbecause of mismatches within these programs. No doubt the pr,ospect of a technical advantage was a spur to some of the advancements that were made in that period. In the future we should\nturn to other spurs to stimulate technical break-throughs.\nNineteenth century Europe awarded prizes and other prestigious\nrecognitions. Possibly the honor associated with such awards\nfrom their peers would inspire men to equal or more lofty pursuits than before. The point to be made here is that dissemination of the latest finite element analysis capability\nbenefits not just aerospace, but machinery, automotive and\nbuilding segments of the structures community. It will lift\nthe calibre of analytical determinations with the ultimate effect\nof raising the stature of our profession.\nIf I have been persuasive on the merits of reducing proliferation, it will establish a credo for us, but it falls short\nof how to put the credo into practice. Our problem is similar\n\n822\n\nto the practice of eugenics. We know that we want to preserve\nand promote only the best. But, who does the choosing? Who\ndeclares what is worthy and what shall be expended? To give\nthe problem even more reality, here in alphabetical order by\norganization are the important, extant finite element programs :\nOrganization\nBell Aerosystems Co.\nBoeing Co.\nBrown University\nUniversity of California\nControl Data Corp./MRI\nConvair/San Diego\nCornell University\nDouglas Aircraft Co.\nGeneral Electric Co.\nGrumman\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nUniversity of Liege\nLockheed Aircraft Co.\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nMartin Co.\nMassachusetts Inst. of Tech.\nNational Aeronautics & Space\nAdministration\nUniversity of Stuttgart\nUniversity of Wales\n\nProgram Name\nMAGIC\nCOSMIC\n{ SAMECS\nASTRA\nPedro Marcal\'s Experimental Program\nWilson Code\nStardyne\nDYNES\nDick Gallagher\'s Experimental\nProgram\nDEMON\nMASS\nASTRAL\nSAMIS\n{ ELAS\nF.

I\ncan only speak for NASA in trying to assuage your fears. An\nattitude that has been expressed at NASA Headquarters has urged\nthat NASA should not force anyone to use NASTRAN. The attitude\nis that if NASTRAN is a good program, people will use it voluntarily; if it is not, people will disregard it.\n\n823\n\nI will let our host the NASTRAN System Management Office\n(NSMO) at Langley Research Center speak for themselves, but I\nhave their assurance that they want to see active competition in\nfuture NASTRAN improvements. After all, in the six years since\nthe design was set until today when long range maintenance has\nbegun, there have been steady technological strides made that\nhave inevitably invalidated some of the NASTRAN code. There\nis a need for reworking a sufficient number of modules and\nroutines that there is room for all to compete and contribute.\nIn fact the spirit in which NSMO was set up was very much in\nthe spirit of partnership between government and industry that\npertained in the old NACA days. In this spirit Dick Martin of\nConvair/San Diego several years ago expressed an industry opinion\nto me that is distinctly in this partnership vein. He said,\n"At first I was opposed to government incursion into the industry province of analysis program development. The longer I\nreflected however, the more I began to realize that there is a\nproper role for government here. The quantity of analytical\nroutines that have achieved competence is so great today compared to several years ago that the cost of developing these\nbig, general purpose finite element programs is so great that\nindividual companies can no longer afford to write their own programs. I think it is a proper role for government to shoulder\nthe cost and responsibility for our modern finite element programs and serve all industry with such up-to-date analytical\ntools. It doesn\'t make sense any more for everyone to go his own\nseparate way. I personally endorse what you are doing in the\nNASTRAN project."\nI have somewhat begged the question by a tangential excursion into government programs. To get back, regardless of\nwhich are chosen, the method of how we should practice our computer program eugenics is the knotty question. I would suggest\na committee. Horrors, some are no doubt saying. I developed\na confidence in decision by committee after my experience with\nthe dedicated, hard work that the NASA Ad Hoc Group on Computer\nMethods in Structural Analysis did over the years. A committee\nwith representatives from the finite element community including government, industry, and universities should set up criteria\nof suitable program maintainability, solution commensurability,\nuser convenience, and machine independence that a program should\nhave to be recognized as maintenance-worthy. A criterion is\nalso needed for an acceptable rate of modernization with respect\nto the rate of state-of-the-arts advancement for budgetary purposes. Finally, a criterion is needed for obsolescence of analysis\nstate-of-the-arts compared to synthesis state-of-the-arts so\nthat there won\'t be an unnecessary commitment of maintenance\nto a passe discipline.\n\n824\n\nOnce the committee has promulgated \' its set of criteria,\nthen that committee should scrutinize all extant finite element\nprograms to determine which of them qualify as maintainable.\nIf these findings receive general acceptability by all segments\nof the analytical community that are concerned then the remaining task is to obtain a solid commitment from a reliable source\nto subsidize the maintenance activity - with the participation\nof an advisory group, of course.\nIt could very well be that a more sage approach to the whole\ntopic of proliferation of programs may be to let nature take\nits course. There could very well be a law of natural selection\nat work which should be allowed to work. Those programs which\nbecome outdated for lack of maintenance (for whatever reason)\nmight naturally be ignored by analysts and only those that\nsatisfy the continuing needs would survive.\nCONCLUSION\nThere is one fundamental precept f or which I would plead.\nSo long as there is no revolutionary break- t hr ough in c omputer\ntechnol ogy; there are enough goo d, maintain able programs in\nexistence today to vitiate against the inaugurati on o f any new\nprograms. Proliferation should subside as the number of programs that are properly maintained reduce t o a vigorous few.\nProliferation impedes the benefits of good communication, economy, and dissemination which can be derived from maintaining\na small number of programs. Before any of today\'s programs are\nretired, however, there should be a concensus within the pro fession as to how best to proceed in the future.\n\nNASA-Langley, 1971 -\n\n32\n\n1- 7980\n\n825\n\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRA1 ION\nWASHINGTON,\n\nD.
