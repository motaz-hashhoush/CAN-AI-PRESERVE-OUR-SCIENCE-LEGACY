At the 1993 Sonic Boom Workshop, improvements to the low-boom design methods were described and early results of two low-boom configurations -935 and -936) were presented. Now that the low boom design methods are reasonably mature, recent design activities have broadened somewhat to explore refinements to the -935 and -936 designs. In this paper the results are reported of a detailed systems study and performance sizing of the -935 (Hybrid sonic boom waveform) and the -936 (Flat-top waveform). This analysis included a second design cycle for reduced cruise drag and balance considerations. Another design study was of a small-wing version of the -935. Finally, some preliminary results of the recent LARC UPWT test of the -935 configuration are given, along with a proposed alternative method for extrapolating wind tunnel pressure signatures to the ground. The various configurations studied is also summarized. The topics covered by this paper are as follows: Systems study results of the Baseline -939 and low boom configurations -935 and -936, Small wing derivative of the -935, Wind tunnel test results of the -935, Test-derived F-function and propagation to the ground, and Future considerations (boom-softened baseline, overwater issues, and operations).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000027445, "id": "c68b73351764471383607e2314a8ac7b", "publicationName": "High-Speed Research: 1994 Sonic Boom Workshop.
