The particular application we illustrate here is social network\nmodeling to support the countering of improvised explosive devices.\n\nnature of the modern battle space. And\nwhile there is no such thing as an optimal\ndecision in a system where the enemy has\na role, data farming allows the decision\nmaker to more fully understand the\nlandscape of possibilities and thereby make\nmore informed decisions. Data farming also\nal lows for the discovery of outliers that may\nlead to findings that allow decision makers\nto no longer be surprised by surprise.\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nData farming uses simulation modeling,\nhigh performance computing , experimental\ndesign, and analysis to examine questions\nof interest with large possibility spaces.\nThis methodology allows for the\nexamination of whole landscapes of\npotential outcomes and provides the\ncapability of executing enough experiments\nso that outliers might be captured and\nexamined for insights. In this paper we will\nprovide an overview of data farming and\ndescribe the six domains of data farming.\nWe will also illustrate data farming in the\ncontext of application to questions inherent\nin military decision-making, in particular\nsocial network analysis related to countering\nimprovised explosive devices.\n\nData farming continues to evolve from initial\nwork in a USMC effort called Project Albert\n(Hoffman and Horne 1998) to the work\ndocumented in the latest edition of the\nScythe (Horne and Meyer 2010)\ndocumenting International Data Farming\n\nWorkshop (IDFW) 20 held in March 2010 in\nMonterey, California. The Scythe is the\npublication of the International Data\nFarming Community that contains the\nproceedings of the IDFWs. IDFW 21 is\nscheduled to take place in Lisbon , Portugal\nin September 201 O.\n\n1.1 Overview of Data Farming\nData farming uses simulation in a\ncollaborative and iterative team process\n(Horne 1997, Horne and Meyer 2004). Thi s\nprocess normally requires input and\nparticipation by subject matter experts,\nmodelers, analysts, and decision-makers.\n\n1.2 The Six Domains of Data\nFarming\nThe discovery of surprises and potential\noptions are made possible by data farming.\nBut many disciplines are behind these\ndi scoveries and their use in the overall data\nfarming process evolved over a period of\n\nData Farming focuses on a more complete\nlandscape of possible system responses\nand progressions, rather than attempting to\npinpoint an answer. This "big pi cture"\nsolution landscape is an invaluable aid to\nthe decision maker in light of the complex\n\n74\n\ntime. In this section we give a brief account\nof this development.\n\ndata farming , gridded designs, where every\nvalue is simulated , are unwieldy.\n\nSix realms or domains were incorporated\ninto the data farming methodology from\n1997 to 2002. Initial data farming efforts in\nthe 1997\xc2\xb798 time frame relied upon mo\nbasic ideas:\n\nThus, using efficient experimental designs is\nessential and The Naval Postgraduate\nSchool in Monterey, California joined\nProject Albert researchers in the early\n2000s with their expertise in this area. And\nNPS researchers have collaborated with\nothers worldwide as well (see Kleijman,\nSanchez , Lucas , and Cioppa 2005).\n\n1. Developing models, called distillations,\nwhich may not have a great deal of\nverisimilitude but could be focused to\nspecifically address the questions at\nhand. (Horne 1999)\n\nFinally , collaboration must take place at\nmany levels if the full power of data farming\nis to be brought upon any question.\nCollaborative processes help to integrate\nthe other five domains of data farming\nthrough interdisciplinary work in creating\nmodels and data farming infrastructure and\nduring the iterative process of prototyping\nscenarios and examining output from model\nruns . Collaboration also takes place\nbetween people from different organizations\nand nations sharing information and\nperspectives at various points in\napproaching common questions.\n\n2. Using high performance computing to\nexecute models many times over varied\ninitial conditions to gain understanding\nof the possible outliers , trends , and\ndistribution of results\nThe models need not be agent\xc2\xb7based\nmodels, but because of the ease with which\nthey can be prototyped , agent-based\nmodels were used during this beginning\ntime period . This rapid prototyping facilitated\nthe iterative nature of the approach the use\nof high performance computing to execute\nmodels many times over varied initial\nconditions to gain understanding of the\npossible outliers, trends , and distribution of\nresults. Also, the huge volume of output\nfrom the simulations made possible by the\nhigh performance computing resulted in a\nneed to develop visualization tools and\nmethods commensurate with this\ntremendous amount of data. Thus ,\nvisualization of simulation data and rapid\nprototyping of scenarios became important\nto data farming efforts in the 1999-2000\ntime frame.\n\nWith the addition of design of experiments\nand collaborative processes in 2001\xc2\xb72002 to\ndata farming efforts , much attention then\nfocused on the defense applications\ndiscussed in the next section . The six\nrealms , or domains, discussed above that\ncontribute to the data farming process are\ndepicted in Figure 1.\n\nThe simulations that defense analysts use\nare often large and complex. An evaluation\nof complete landscapes is extremely time\nconsuming , sometimes not even possible.\nAlso, even the smaller more abstract agentbased distillations referred to above can\nhave many parameters that are potentially\nsignificant and that could take on many\nval ues. Thus, even with high performance\ncomputing and the small models used in\n\nThe Six\n\nRealm .. of\nData rarmmg\n\nFigu re 1. The Six Domains of Data Farming\n\n75\n\n1.3 Defense Appli cations\n\na team effort with international and interagency participation, is explori ng methods\nof extracting , analyzing , and visualizing\ndynamic social networks that are inherent in\nmodels with agent interaction . This effort is\nbeing conducted in order to build tools that\nmay be useful in examining and potentially\nmanipulating insurgencies . The team\nstarted with a simple scenario that evolves\ncliques via interactions based on shared\nattributes. This simple model is the initial\nbasis for the team\'s investigations and is\nbeing used to examine the types of network\nstatistics that can be used as MOEs and\npointers to unique and emergent behaviors\nof interest.\n\nSince the incorporation of the above six\ndomains into the process we call data\nfarming, several arti cles have captured the\nfundamentals of data farming (e.g. Horne\nand Meyer 2005) . But the key tenet in the\ndata farming process has been the focus on\nthe questions and since 2002 many\napplication efforts have been documented.\nFor example, at the Naval Postg raduate\nSchool many theses have been completed\nwhich have used data farm ing. And over the\npast decade, over 150 international work\nteams have formed around questions at\nInternational Data Farming Workshops .\nThese 150 work teams fall into areas , or\nthemes, which include: Joint and Combined\nOperations (e.g. C41SR Operations,\nNetwork Centric Warfare, Networked Fires,\nand Future Combat Missions), Urban\n\nThe team \'s initial goals were to extend this\nvery basic scenario with simple variations\nand to test candidate tools and prototype\nmethods for data fa rming the scenario,\nextracting ner.vork data, analyzing end-ofrun ner.vork statistics , and visualizing\nnetwork behaviors .\n\nOperations, Combat Support (e.g. UAV\nOperations, Roboti cs, Logistics, and\nCombat 10), Peace Support Operations, the\nGlobal War on Terrorism , Homeland\nDefense, Disaster Relief, and others.\n\nSocia l Network Analysis (SNA) techniques\nwere explored in detail to determine which\nnetwork metrics would be most beneficial\nfor analyzing the types of networks\nproduced by the agent-based scenario.\nDeveloping these tools and methods, and\ndelineating applicable metrics will allow the\nexploration of questions rega rding C-IED\nissues-including insurgent network\nevolution and adaptation.\n\nThe types of questions in these areas\ntypica lly do not have precisely defined initial\nconditions and a complete set of algorithms\nthat describe the system being considered .\nThese questions address open systems that\ndefy prediction . Data farming is used to\nprovide insight that can be used by\ndecision-makers. As an illustrative\nexample, we now describe how data\nfarming is being integrated with other\ntechniques in the context of countering\nimprovised explosive devices.\n\nInsu rgent networks can be categorized into\ntwo groups of interest to C-IED efforts: lED\nEmplacement Networks (consisting of\npersonnel that are directly involved with lED\nusage) and lED Enabling Networks\n(consisting of communities that indirectly\nsupport and enable the lED Emplacement\nnetworks). This study is identifying tools\nthat can be used to explore patterns that\nmight provide valuable insights into\nemergent behaviors of interest for both of\nthese classes of networks.\n\n2.0 ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATION :\nSOCIAL NETWORK MODELING TO\nSUPPORT THE COUNTER-lED FIGHT\nThi s work represents results from an\nongoing study to examine the utility of\ndisti llation modeling in the Counter-lED\n(Improvised Explosive Devices) fight.\nUnderstanding social networks, their nature\nin insurgencies and lED networks, and how\nto impact them , is important to the Counter-\n\nlED (C-IED) fight. This study, conducted as\n\n76\n\n2.1\n\nBackground\n\nfarming output provided from previous\nwork.\n\nIn previous work related to the use of agent\xc2\xb7\nbased modeling in the C-IED work, task\nplans aimed at addressing specific C-IED\nquestions were developed. The current\nwork is aimed at producing capabilities that\ncan address these tasks. Tasks topics\nincluded: methods of indirect network\nattack; identifying important link layers for\nimpacting the insurgent networks in specific\nenvironments, identifying important\nindividuals, emergence of insurgent cells,\neroding popular support for insurgent\nnetworks.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDelineated the data requirements for the\nvarious types of networks that might be\nextracted from various modeling.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEstablished and documented software\nand processes for applying these\ncapabilities to detecting and analyzing\nemergent networks.\n\nThis work has lead to the study team\'s\nconviction that additional work needs to be\naccomplished in order to address C\xc2\xb7IEDoriented problems. Generalized SNAIdata\nfarming tools that can be applied to output\nfrom various model types should have the\ncapability to:\n\nFrom this set of tasks the study team\nselected a set of candidate tasks for followup study and analysis. It was concluded that\nboth data farming and SNA concepts and\ntechniques needed to be applied to address\nthe candidate tasks and that the current set\nof tools and methods available in these\ndomains was not up to the task required .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetect the presence of a network or\nnetworks.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe study team is working on developing\nthe necessary tools and methods. In this\neffort we have:\n\nDistinguish different networks and\ndifferent classes of networks.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetermine if and when networks\nachieve equilibrium .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDemonstrated the ability to extract\nsocial netvolork data from an existing\nscenario that included agent interaction,\nbut that did not explicitly define a\nnetwork. In this scenario the network\n"emerged" or evolved from the basic\nagent interactions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetermine which model inputs have\nsignificant impact on the state and\nbehaviors of the network.\n\nData farmed this initial scenario and\nestablished the need to simplify the\ntarget scenario in order to more closely\nexamine cause and effect relationships\nto SNA statistics.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV\'vtlat do insurgent networks look like?\nV\'vtlo is in the neMlork? V\'vtlo is not?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHow do we distinguish networks that\nshould be attacked, networks that\nshould be attritted or that should be coopted?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nV\'vtlo are the High Value Individuals\n(HVI) and what are their identifiable\ncharacteristics?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\/ViII removing specific nodes destabilize\na network?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpecifically, the intent is to use these\ncapabilities to be able to address a variety\nof social neMlork questions such as:\n\nDeveloped a new base scenario,\ndelineated a simple illustrative design of\nexperiment (DOE), and data farmed the\nmodel to provide a sample data set for\nfurther exploration .\nExamined the utility of and approach to\napplying specific SNA statistics ,\nmethods, and concepts using the data\n\n77\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\f\\Jhat are the 2nd and 3rd order effects\nof network manipulation?\n\nvarious SNA measures and analysis\ntechniques .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\f\\Jhat are the potential unintended\nconsequences?\n\nPythagoras can provide multiple views of\nagent state data. A spatial view showed the\nphysical relationship between entitities and\nwhere connections or bonds were formed.\nThe inclination space view sorted the\nentities by colors. This color space view is\nused to illustrate the homophilic state of the\nparticipating entities in the simulation .\n\n2.2 Abstracted Illustrative Scen ario\nand DOE\nThe Pythagoras agent-based model\ndevelopment environment was used for the\ninitial scenarios. The first phase of acti vity\nwas based on the Pythagoras distribution\n"Peace" scenario with some minor\nmodifications of the source code to support\nthe extraction of network interaction data.\nData farming of this scenario demonstrated\nthe ability to extract inherent emergent\nnetwork data. Initial analysis of the results\nled to the development of a more basic\nscenario in order to test basic network\nconcepts.\n\nA very basic full-factorial design space was\nused to data farm the scenario.\nTable 1.

CC has a single agent class with\n100 instantiated agents that are uniformly\ndistributed across Pythagoras\'s red and\nblue color spaces . The agents\' only\n\'\'weapon" is "Chat" which induces a relative\ncolor change on other agents with which the\nagent interacts. As the scenario is executed,\nentities move through various color states ,\nbecoming "more" red or "more" blue\ndepending on the interactions with other\nred-"ish" or blue-"ish" entities. States will\nchange depending on whether two entities\nengage in "chatting" and form a connection.\nThe more any two agents interact, the more\n"alike" they become .\n\n\'"\n\nn\n\n..\n\n"\n"\n."\n"\n"\n"\n\'"\n"\n"\n"\n"\n"\n"\n\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n,\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\'"\n\nR ~atr.ea.ange\n\n00\n00\n00\n00\n00\n\nw\nw\nw\nw\n\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\'"\n,\n\ntnnuenceRng\n\nFrIef1dThrKh\n\n"\n"\n"\n\n\'00\n\n\'00\n\'00\n\'00\n\n\'\'"\n\'\'"\n\'\'"\n"\n"\n\'00\n"\n\'00\n\'00\n\nm\n\'\'"\n""\n"\n"\n\n\'00\n\'00\n\' 00\n\'00\n\'00\n\n"\n\n\'00\n\n\'00\n\n\'00\n\n\'\'"\n""\n""\n\n\'00\n\n\'00\n\'00\n\n\'"\n\nEnemyThrKh\n00\n\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\nw\n\'"\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\'"\'\nw\n\'"\n00\n00\n\n00\n00\n00\n00\n\n\'"\'\n\'"\n\nThe design matrix (Table 1) reflects four\ninput parameters that will influence the\ncomposition of the resulting networks:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFriendThresh - Agents within this range\nare considered "linked. "\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n78\n\nInfluenceRng - Maximum distance of\nchat.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe focus of the scenario selection was to\nrepresent dynamic homophi ly and use the\nresults to explore the various analysis tools\nunder study. Multiple excursions and\nreplications of the Pythagoras-developed\nClique Creator scenario were used to\nproduce the data for analysis with the\ncandidate tools . This baseline provided a\nmeans for the team to experiment with\n\nReJativeChange - Percentage relative\nchange of color when "chatted."\n\nEnemyThresh - Dependent variable ; is\ncalculated as FriendThresh plus 55, in\norder to preserve the same Friend to\nEnemy Distance (equivalent to the\n"neutral" range) as was present in the\nbase scenario .\n\nFigure 2 shows four time-steps of an\nw\ninclination"-space view. In this image the\nlocation of the agents is based on thei r\nlocation in color space. The "redness" (0255) of the agent is represented on the x\naxis. The "blueness" (0-255) of the agent is\nrepresented on the y axis. As the scenario\nproceeds left to right, top to bottom , note the\ncongregation of agents into color groups.\nThese groups do not represent the cliques\nformed though , because the spatial aspect\nis not represented .\n\nThe CC scenario can be considered as a\nmetaphor for a group of people establishing\nrelationships based on shared interests or\ndesires (color space proximity) and physical\nproximity (relative agent location). Agents\nare drawn toward agents with similar color\nand move away from agents of disimilar\ncolor. The closer agents are in location, the\nmore frequently they "chat" each other, and\nthus , the closer they grow in color space.\nEventually, cliques of "like-interest" agent\nform and are impacted by other agents and\ncliques. The input parameters varied in the\ndesign matrix affect these behavioral\nprocesses in straightforward ways.\n\n.\n\no\n\nI. \xe2\x80\xa2 .... :-.

CC Scenario - Static Graph View\n\nFigure 3 shows a static network layout\nrepresentation of one of the CC time-steps\nusing the default SNA layout algorithm . The\nSNA R package plots each time-step\nindependently, not accounting for the layout\ndefined in the previous time-step. The\nlayout of each time-step is independent and\nas a result , the dynamic evolution is difficult\nto examine.\n\nSNA statistics fall into two classes: node\nstatistics and network statistics. Node\nstatistics include: betweenness, closeness,\neigenvector centrality , and degree. Network\nstatistics include: number of components,\nnumber of cliques , and average path length.\nThe study team decided to focus on node\nstatistics initially and produced time-series\noutput for every node of betweenness ,\neigenvector centrality and degree. Although\ndata for 27 excursions of data farming was\ncollected, it was decided to do an intial\ncomparison of three excursions , where the\nprimary variation was the color distance that\ndefined what is considered a friend (a\nhomophilic link). Excursions 0, 1, and 2\nwere examined.\n\n/\n\nFigure 4. CC Scenario - Dynamic Graph View\n\nFigure 5 represents one replication each\nfrom excusions 0, 1, and 2 as delineated in\nTable 1. The three plots represent the\ndegree of each agent over time . The vertical\naxis is degree (the number of links\nassociated with a node), the horizontal axis\nis time , and the axis going into the page is\nagent number. Figure 5 was generated\nusing the PlotGL plugin to R.\n\nFigure 4 shows a single time-step using the\nSoNIA application. SoNIA is designed to\nsupport dynamic time-series network data.\nAs a result, the layout of any timestep can\nbe based on the previous time step as a\nstarting point. The result is a layout which\ndisplays the evolution of the network, but\n\n80\n\n--\n\nwith in color space leads to increased\ninstability in terms of clique formation. The\ninitial assumption was that this would affect\nthe size of the cliques and number of\ncomponents. The unexpected result is that\nthis increase prevents the stabilization of\ncliques and network components. Rather, it\nappears that this increase results in groups\nbeing able to "steal" members from other\ngroups more easily.\nA nother interesting behavior is the\nExcursion 0 (Figure Sa) degree variation\nthat occurs before equilibrium. In this case it\nappears that larger components are formed\nintially, but that they devolve into smaller\ngroups over time. The team intends to\ninvestigate the set of replicates associated\nwith this excursion to determine whether\nthis behavior is consistent for this level of\nFriendThresh.\n\n3.0 SUMMARY AND WAY AHEAD\nSignificant insight was gained by team\nmembers in delineating capabilities needed\nin a tool kit for the extraction and analysis of\ndynamic social data from models. The\nfollowing capabilities wi ll be needed for\nongoing data farming research of basic\nsocial networks:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 5. Centrality for Excursions 1\xc2\xb73\n\nIn Figure 5, various pattern differences,\nrelated to the evolution and devolution of\ncliques and components, can be discerned\nThere are obvious differences between the\nexcusions, with 0 and 1 appearing to reach\ncovergence, but 2 never converging. It can\nbe seen that some agents reach a steadystate and maintain it for some time, while\nother groups of agents particpate in\nbehaviours which lead to the growth and\nreduction of degree for groups of agents.\n\nSynching of Visualization : Various\nrepresentations of the dynamic network\nare useful, but examining multiple views\n\nof the network time-step synced would\nprovide powerful relational insights.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEquilibrium Time: Determining whether\nequilibrium occurs and how long it takes\nis often the first step in analysis.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nData Fanning Time Window\nReduction Size: Dynamic network\nanalysis requires defining what\nconstitutes a link, for example , a single\ninteracti on or multiple interactions over\nsome time window.
