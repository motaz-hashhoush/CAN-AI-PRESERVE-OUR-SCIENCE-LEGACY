Ashen Light is most often reported when Venus is in the evening sky, when the evening terminator of Venus is toward the earth. It is argued that the local time asymmetry is too great to be explained by terrestrial effects alone. It is argued that Venus lightning is the only known phenomenon that shows a marked dawn-dusk asymmetry on Venus and which could also explain the occurrence of Ashen Light. The following factors appear to affect the visibility of Ashen Light from earth: the distance of Venus from the earth, the length of time Venus is above the horizon, and the local time distribution of the Ashen Light source on Venus.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "10", "submissionId": 19900030862, "issue": "5 19", "issn": "0273-1177", "id": "398d6d279b3f483689e55e036198411b", "publicationName": "Advances in Space Research", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
