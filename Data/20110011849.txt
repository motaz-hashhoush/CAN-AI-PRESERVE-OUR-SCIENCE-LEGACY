The construction of all systems will be completed by the end of 2011. The project was named Korea VLBI\nsystem for Geodesy (KVG), and its main purpose is to maintain the Korea Geodetic Datum. In case\nof the KVG system, an observation room with an H-maser frequency standard is located in a building\nseparated from the antenna by several tens of meters. Therefore KVG system will adopt a so-called\nround-trip system to transmit reference signals to the antenna with reduction of the e\xef\xac\x80ect of path\nlength variations. KVG\xe2\x80\x99s round-trip system is designed not only to use either metal or optical \xef\xac\x81ber\ncables, but also to measure path length variations directly. We present this unique round trip system\nfor KVG.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe round-trip system used in the frequency distribution system is a system to transmit a\nreference frequency signal to a remote place separated by a few tens to hundreds of meters from\na signal source such as an H-maser frequency standard while diminishing the e\xef\xac\x80ect caused by\nthe change of transmission cable length. The reference frequency distribution system supplies\nreference frequency (10 MHz or 100 MHz) and timing signals (1 PPS) generated by the H-maser\nfrequency standard to devices that require these reference signals. Such devices are located not\nonly in the observation room close to the H-maser frequency standard, but also in the receiver\ncabin of the antenna separated from the observation building by several tens to hundreds of meters.\nTherefore, a system is needed to transmit reference signals to the receiver cabin in a stable manner.\nBuried cables or \xef\xac\x81bers at a depth of 1\xe2\x80\x932 m o\xef\xac\x80er the greatest stability of the transmission path\nto the antenna. Path length variations are directly related to the accuracy of geodetic VLBI\nmeasurements, so they should be kept as small as possible. The e\xef\xac\x80ect of these path length variations\ncan be diminished by using a round-trip system as a reference frequency transmitting system.\n\n2. Principle of Round-trip System\nFigure 1 shows a schematic block diagram of a round-trip system. The system consists of a\nreference signal generator, an oscillator, and transmission cables (metal co-axial cable).\nA signal with a frequency of f0 (= f1 + f2 ) is generated by H-maser frequency standard and\nput into the system at A. The signal is mixed with signal f2 transmitted from B to form signal\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\n449\n\nHongjong Oh et al.:\n\nRound-trip System\n\nFigure 1. Schematic block diagram of a round-trip system.\n\nf1 . This signal is transmitted to B. At B, signal f1 is mixed with signal f2 , which is a locally\ngenerated signal, to form the sum frequency f1 + f2 (= f0 ). This is a reference signal transmitted\nto B. Signal f2 is also transmitted to A.\nThe principle of operation can be expressed as follows. Signal at 1 can be expressed as\nS1 = (sin2\xcf\x80(f1 + f2 )t + \xcf\x860 )\n\n(1)\n\nS5 = sin(2\xcf\x80f2 t + \xcf\x86osc )\n\n(2)\n\ntherefore signal at 2 is given by\nL\n) + \xcf\x86osc )\n(3)\nv\nwhere \xcf\x85 is the velocity of signal transmission in a cable. Signal at 3 is a low-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered\nsignal of products of S1 and S2 , which is\nS2 = sin(2\xcf\x80f2 (t \xe2\x88\x92\n\nS1 \xc2\xb7 S2 = (sin2\xcf\x80(f1 + f2 )t + \xcf\x860 ) \xc2\xb7 (sin(2\xcf\x80f2 (t \xe2\x88\x92\n\nL\n) + \xcf\x86osc )\nv\n\n(4)\n\nHence\nL\n1\nS3 = cos(2\xcf\x80f1 t + 2\xcf\x80f2 + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86osc )\n2\nv\nTherefore signal at 4 , is given as\nL\nL\n1\nS4 = cos(2\xcf\x80f1 (t \xe2\x88\x92 ) + 2\xcf\x80f2 + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86osc )\n2\nv\nv\nSignal at 6 is a high-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered signal of products of S4 and S5 .\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nL\nL\n1\nS4 \xc2\xb7 S5 = cos(2\xcf\x80f1 (t \xe2\x88\x92 ) + 2\xcf\x80f2 + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86osc ) \xc2\xb7 sin(2\xcf\x80f2 t + \xcf\x86osc )\n2\nv\nv\n1\nL\nS6 = sin(2\xcf\x80(f1 + f2 )t + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 ) )\n4\nv\n450\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\nHongjong Oh et al.:\n\nRound-trip System\n\nNote that the phase of an oscillator does not appear in the output. We focus on two components,\nwhich are frequency and length of cables. The phase di\xef\xac\x80erence between signals A and B is given\nby comparing Eq (1) and (9) as\nL\n(9)\nv\nHence the change of cable length from L to L + \xe2\x88\x86L results in the change of phase as follows,\n\xcf\x86 = 2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 )\n\n\xe2\x88\x86L\n(10)\nv\nWhen a signal is transmitted directly at f0 = f1 + f2 , the phase change due to cable length\nchange is given by\n\xe2\x88\x86\xcf\x86 = 2pi(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 )\n\n\xe2\x88\x86L\n(11)\nv\nTherefore phase variation due to the cable length change can be suppressed to the level of\n(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 )/(f1 + f2 ) compared with the case of that signal being directly transmitted at a frequency\nf0 (= f1 + f2 ). The round-trip system developed for the VERA project, which is the Japanese\nVLBI project dedicated to astrometry, adopts f1 = 690M Hz, f2 = 710M Hz (i.e., f0 is 1400\nMHz). In this case the change of phase is suppressed by |690 \xe2\x88\x92 710|/1400 = 0.014. Phase variation\nis suppressed about 1% level compared with the case of direct transmission.\n\xe2\x88\x86\xcf\x86 = 2\xcf\x80(f1 + f2 )\n\n3. Detection of Phase Variation\n\nFigure 2. Schematic block diagram of round-trip system designed for measurement of phase variation.\n\nA round-trip system as described in Section 2 is the system dedicated to suppress phase variation due to cable length change as much as possible. Therefore it does not intend to measure the\nphase variation itself.\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\n451\n\nHongjong Oh et al.:\n\nRound-trip System\n\nIn order to monitor phase change directly, we consider the system shown in Figure 2. At side\nB, signal f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 is generated. This signal is a low-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered signal of products of S4 and S5 in\nthe previous section (in this section written as S45L ).\n1\nL\nS45L = \xe2\x88\x92 sin(2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 )t \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 ) + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86osc )\n(12)\n4\nv\nThis signal is injected to a metal cable through a directional-coupler then transmitted to A.\nS45L(A) thus becomes\nL\n1\n(13)\nS45L(A) = \xe2\x88\x92 sin(2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 )t \xe2\x88\x92 2 \xc2\xb7 2\xcf\x80(f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 ) + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x86osc )\n4\nv\nAt side A, the same frequency signal is generated independently of S2 and S3 in the previous\nsection. The signal is a low-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered signal of the product of S2 and S3 . Therefore it is\nexpressed as follows,\n1\nL\nS23L(A) = \xe2\x88\x92 sin(2\xcf\x80f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 t + 2 \xc2\xb7 2\xcf\x80f2 + \xcf\x860 \xe2\x88\x92 2\xcf\x86osc )\n4\nv\nHence the phase di\xef\xac\x80erence between S23L and S45L(A) is given by\n\n(14)\n\nL\n(15)\nv\nTherefore the change of cable length from L to L+\xe2\x88\x86L results in the change of phase as follows,\n\xcf\x86 = 2 \xc2\xb7 2\xcf\x80f1\n\n\xe2\x88\x86L\n(16)\nv\nThis corresponds to the double of phase change at frequency. In the case of VERA, the\nfrequency was set to f1 = 690M Hz, f2 = 710M Hz, and f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 = 20M Hz. In the case of KVG, it\nwas set to f1 = 689.9M Hz, f2 = 710.1M Hz, and f1 \xe2\x88\x92 f2 = 20.2M Hz. This frequency signal can\nbe sampled by using the K5/VSSP32 VLBI sampler, which has a maximum sampling frequency\nof 64 MHz. We will reduce the sampling frequency; we can use 2 MHz, 1 MHz, and even 500 kHz\nas a sampling frequency. So that phase can be monitored digitally by using this sampler.\n\xe2\x88\x86\xcf\x86 = 2 \xc2\xb7 2\xcf\x80f1\n\n4. Application to KVG System\nIn the KVG system, we develop a round-trip system that can use both metal cable and optical\n\xef\xac\x81ber (not simultaneously but exclusively). Our plan is that the manufacturing will be \xef\xac\x81nished in\nJune 2010 and that we will proceed with testing in July.
