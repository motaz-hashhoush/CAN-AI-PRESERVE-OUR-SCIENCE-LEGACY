The achievements of seismological source theory and data analyses, mechanical modeling of fault zone behavior, and advances in space-based geodesy are reviewed, with emphasis on realizable contributions of space-based geodetic measurements specifically to seismology. The fundamental relationships between crustal deformation associated with an earthquake and the geodetically observable data are summarized. The response and spatial and temporal resolution of the geodetic data necessary to understand deformation at various phases of the earthquake cycle is stressed. The use of VLBI, SLR, and GPS measurements for studying global geodynamics properties that can be investigated to some extent with seismic data is discussed. The potential contributions of continuously operating strain monitoring networks and globally distributed geodetic observatories to existing worldwide modern digital seismographic networks are evaluated in reference to mutually addressable problems in seismology, geophysics, and tectonics.", "title": "Seismology and space-based geodesy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T14:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940035953, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tralli, David M."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "c2f0504ef57b4ddda924ac0aa54eaf60"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940035953, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tajima, Fumiko"}, "organization": {"name": "Texas Univ.", "location": "Austin, United States"}}, "id": "d6fe4e3bff4647e3bd8f9548012d8e28"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940035953, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940035953, "publisher": "Academic Press, Inc.", "id": "ec4271e71c1e4720916ba9d1595ffa77", "publicationName": "In: Advances in geophysics.
