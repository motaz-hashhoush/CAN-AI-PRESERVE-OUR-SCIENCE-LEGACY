The need to control the thickness of the plasma deposit led to the development of advanced optical gaging techniques to monitor and control plasma spray build-up on blade surfaces. The techniques led to computerized optical gages for inspecting aircraft, industrial turbine blades, etc. MMTC offers 10 standard commercial robotic gages. The system also generates two dimensional profiles for assessing status and specifying repairs to the electromechanical cathodes used to make the parts. It is capable of accuracies to a ten-thousandth of an inch. An expanded product line is currently marketed. The gages offer multiple improvements in quality control and significant savings.", "title": "Manufacturing Aids", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020087651, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087651, "id": "b1d98ec725b24efe9e5791bab55dfc8c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1989", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020087651.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020087651/downloads/20020087651.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020087651/downloads/20020087651.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020087651/downloads/20020087651.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
