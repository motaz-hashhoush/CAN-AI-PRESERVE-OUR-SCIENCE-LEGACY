Samples of aluminum 2024 were polished and etched in different reagents. Optical micrographs (at 500X) of samples etched in Keller's reagent revealed grain boundaries as well as some particles present in the microstructure. Normal x-ray scans of samples etched for different intervals of time in Keller's reagent indicate no significant variations in diffraction peak positions; however, the width of the rocking curve increased with the time of etching. These results are consistent with the direct dependence of the width of the rocking curve on the range of grain orientation. Etching removes the preferred orientation layer of the sample produced by polishing; thereby, causing the width to increase.", "title": "Fatigue damage study in aluminum-2024 T3 alloys", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930007578, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ferguson, Milton W."}, "organization": {"name": "Norfolk State Univ.", "location": "VA, United States"}}, "id": "adc849e7ab044c518818e465ef3bd4e5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930007578, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930007578, "id": "106d38a085d64920adbc99f7f919aaf8", "publicationName": "Hampton Univ., NASA(American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program 1992 p 97-98 (SEE N93-16760 05-80)", "publicationDate": "1992-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930007571, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA/American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Summer Faculty Fellowship Program 1992", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930007578.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930007578/downloads/19930007578.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930007578/downloads/19930007578.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930007578/downloads/19930007578.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
