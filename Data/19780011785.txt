b'SUMMARY REPORT OF COMMITTEE A\nCharles H. Sprinkle\nNational Weather Service\nCommittee Composition: (See Table 4 , page 11 )\nI. Session with Standing Committee on Aircraft Design\nIt was stated that current procedures for designing\nstructural (strength) components with respect to turbulence\nforcing functions are adequate; however, it was emphasized\nthat we must be sure to separate structural (strength)\ncomponents and control components in our discussions.\nEngineering procedures - adequate (aircraft do not break\nare\nup in flight). It was agreed that there is sufficient\nturbulence data available to do adequate modeling; however,\nit may be well to look into an updated discrete gust model.\nNewer, more sophisticated aircraft do not behave like the\nold aircraft.\nSpectral models are an improvement over discrete gust\nmodels. Spectral models give you everything the discrete\ngust model gives you, plus more. The amount of effort is\nidentical; however, the numbers may need updating--at least\nsomeone should take a look at it. We\'re in a better position\nto give better numbers now.\nA need to update meteorological data below 2,000 Et. was\nexpressed. The atmosphere is very different below 2,000 ft.\nWe need more information on low level eddies, also need more\ninformation on the patchiness of turbulence at all levels.\nThere is a lack of correlation at low altitudes in the U, V,\nand W components at the same time. Rolling effects should\nbe considered in aircraft design. Information is also needed\non wind shear for design purposes. Need wind profiles, and\nthey should be incorporated into specifications. For thunderstorms and other severe weather we can\'t design for the worst\n\n309\ni\n\ncases. A s for wind shear, it\'s not a design (structure)\nproblem, it\'s a control problem!\nWith respect to lightning, more detection design work\nis needed. Data are not sufficient and not fully understood.\nWe really don\'t know the impact of lightning on onboard\ndigital systems.\nThe state of the art for forecasting meteorological\nelements is sufficient for design purposes.\nSession with Standing Committee on Simulation\nThere are no standard models. In fact, there are\nseveral within one company. There are several types of wind\nand turbulence models. Some models are better for some\nthings than others. Models are generally oversimplified.\nSimulator models cannot take care of all cases. There must\nbe a bounds placed on the simulation (average, extreme, and\nmoderate).\nIn reference to turbulence model studies, authors should\nbe encouraged to include mathematical methods for solution\nin their papers. Frequently it\'s not readily apparent as to\nhow to arrive at the solution.\nThe persons more deeply involved in simulation stated\nthat current turbulence simulation models are adequate. Also,\nthe meteorological data is sufficient to simulate the effects\nof icing, temperature variations, humidity variations, etc.\nIt was pointed out that a wealth of data is currently\nbeing collected in the form of profiles in the lower atmosphere. The FAA (NAFEC) will be the principal source of this\ndata. It will be possible to have this new data available\nshortly (within the next year).\n11.\n\n111. Session with Standing Committee on General Services\nAt the outset, it was agreed that the ultimate goal of\naviation weather services is the delivery of accurate and\ntimely information to the cockpit flight crew.\n\n310\na\n\nThere were several items raised which demand action to\nprovide better service. They were:\nMore frequent updates of the Transcribed Weather\nBroadcasts (TWEB)--make it a higher priority job\nwithin the Flight Service Stations (FSS) (need\nsomeone from the FSS side of the house within FAA\nto speak to this problem);\nSIGMET\'s not being broadcast on VOR;\nNAMFAX circuit has too much information moving on\nit that does not support aviation (NWS will examine\nthe circuit and attempt to remove some extraneous\ncharts).\nOther items and questions raised were:\nThere is a need for a pilot\'s satellite "handbook"\nto aid the pilot in the interpretation of satellite\ninformation.\nWith regard to the dependability of data, the\nquestion was asked, "How much are you willing to\n\'pay\' for small improvement in an already good\nsystem?" This was unanswered.\nWith respect to the shortage of personnel in meteorology and aviation weather services, little hope\nwas offered for increased personnel. The aviation\nW\nindustry pointed out to N S that quality control\nof products and services is vital and should be\nsought at every opportunity.\nAs far as weather training as a service, it was\nis\nnoted that forecaster-to-pilot briefing - an\neducation to both of the participants in the exercise.\nThe responsibility for aviation weather research\nwas noted to be splintered among many agencies.\nN O M , DOD, FAA, NASA, etc., all appear to be\n0\n\n311\n\ndoing something. To what extent are the programs\ncoordinated? It was felt that the role of the\nFederal Coordinator should be brought more into\nplay, defining the content and quality of R&D as\nwell as defining the direction we are heading.\nQuestion was asked concerning follow-ups of\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations--who has the authority? FAA pointed\nout that there is now a specific office within FPA,\nformed recently, that is bird-dogging NTSB recommendations.\nDiscussion concluded with recommendations on a future\naviation workshop :\nA more structured meeting in 1-2 years;\nAttempt to include representatives from some\ngroups absent from this initial effort;\nInclude persons with decision-making authority;\nand\nA more complete package to participants in advance\nof the workshop (some important inputs could be\ngathered before coming to the meeting).\nSession with Standing Committee on General Aviation\nThe initial item under discussion centered around education. How do you make pilots aware o f what is available\nand where to get it (films, etc.)? A publication (such as\nthe Airmen\'s Information Manual) could list available information. Also, some feeling was expressed that student\npilots should be given some actual in-flight experience with\nbad (IFR) weather (under proper supervisions, of course).\nEducation should also pass from the pilot to others. Pilots\nshould be informed that they have the responsibility of\npassing weather information to the tower, UNICOM, etc., in\nIV.\n\n312\n\nregard to wind shear, winds not as forecast or not as\nindicated, etc. There is a real need for timely exchange\nof safety information between all concerned.\nSeveral other items were touched upon briefly. They\nincluded :\nToo much background noise on ATIS (Automatic\nTerminal Information Service) --difficult to understand;\nTWEB/PATWAS updating not frequent enough--"Updating\n"WEB is 9 or 10 on the FSS priority list";\n927 airports have instrument approaches without\nobservations;\nNeed an FAA publication on good practices of UNICOM\noperations (should include altitude restrictions\non UNICOM);\nIn the A.I.M., the section on good operating\npractices should be examined for things that do\nnot apply to all aircraft and airports. A rewrite\nis needed to bring them in line with the real\nworld;\nNot enough emphasis is placed on the human factor\nin accident investigation--especially in general\naviation accidents ;\nWhat are the time definitions of ocnl, vrbl, etc.\n. . . (the definitions are available in NWS and\nFAA publications).\nIn conclusion, it was pointed out the importance of\nproper attitude in pilots. Proper attitude must be instilled\n--you cannot legislate common sense!\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n313\n\n'
