Today, human flight experience extends only to Low-Earth Orbit (LEO), and should problems arise during a mission, the crew can return to\nEarth in a matter of minutes to hours. The next logical\nstep for human spaceflight is to gain flight experience\nin the vicinity of the Moon. These cis-lunar missions\nprovide a \xe2\x80\x9cproving ground\xe2\x80\x9d for the testing of systems\nand operations while still accommodating an emergency return path to the Earth that would last only several\ndays. Cis-lunar mission experience will be essential for\nmore ambitious human missions beyond the EarthMoon system, which will require weeks, months, or\neven years of transit time.\nMission Description: NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Asteroid Redirect\nMission (ARM) consists of two mission segments: 1)\nthe Asteroid Redirect Robotic Mission (ARRM), the\nfirst robotic mission to visit a large (greater than ~100\nm diameter) near-Earth asteroid (NEA), collect a multiton boulder from its surface along with regolith samples, and return the asteroidal material to a stable orbit\naround the Moon; and 2) the Asteroid Redirect Crewed\nMission (ARCM), in which astronauts will explore the\nboulder and return to Earth with samples. NASA originally proposed a robotic mission concept to capture an\nentire small asteroid (4-10 m in size) that would leverage several key ongoing activities in human exploration, space technology, and planetary defense. Subsequently, an alternate approach to collect a boulder from\na large asteroid was also proposed. NASA evaluated\nboth mission approaches, to determine their feasibility,\nidentify the important differences between them, and\nevaluate the key risks and figures of merit for each\nconcept. On March 25, 2015, NASA announced the\nselection of the boulder capture option for the robotic\nsegment of ARM. The ARRM is planned to launch at\nthe end of 2020 and the ARCM is scheduled for late\n2025.\nMission Objectives: The Asteroid Redirect Mission is designed to address the need for flight experience in cis-lunar space and provide opportunities of for\ntesting the systems, technologies, and capabilities that\nwill be required for future human deep space operations. A principle objective of the ARM is the devel-\n\nopment of a high-power Solar Electric Propulsion\n(SEP) vehicle, and the demonstration that it can operate for many years in interplanetary space, which is\ncritical for deep-space exploration missions. A second\nprime objective of ARM is to conduct a human spaceflight mission involving in-space interaction with a\nnatural object, in order to provide the systems and operational experience that will be required for eventual\nhuman exploration of Mars, including the Martian\nmoons Phobos and Deimos. The ARCM provides a\nfocus for the early flights of the Orion program, which\nwill take place before the infrastructure for more ambitious flights will be available. Astronauts will participate in the scientific in-space investigation of nearly\npristine asteroid material, at most only minimally altered by the capture process. The ARCM will provide\nthe opportunity for human explorers to work in space\nwith asteroid material, testing the activities that would\nbe performed and tools that would be needed for later\nexploration of primitive body surfaces in deep space.\nThe operational experience would be gained close to\nour home planet, making it a significantly more affordable approach to obtaining this experience.\nTarget Asteroid Candidates: NASA has identified the NEA (341843) 2008 EV5 as the reference target for the ARRM, but is also carrying three other\nNEAs as potential options [(25143) Itokawa, (162173)\nRyugu, and (101955) Bennu]. The final target selection\nfor the ARRM will be made approximately a year before launch, but there is a strong recommendation from\nthe scientific and resource utilization communities that\nthe ARM target be volatile and organic rich. Three of\nthe proposed candidates are carbonaceous NEAs. Specifically, the reference target, 2008 EV5 is a carbonaceous (C-type) asteroid that has been remotely characterized (via visual, infrared, and radar wavelengths), is\nbelieved to be hydrated, and provides significant return\nmass (boulders on the surface greater than 20 metric\ntons). It also has an advantage in that the orbital dynamics of the NEA fall within the current baseline mission timeline of five years between the return of the\nrobotic vehicle to cis-lunar space and the launch of the\nARCM. Therefore, NEA 2008 EV5 provides a valid\ntarget that can be used to help with formulation and\ndevelopment efforts.\nRecent Community Input to ARM: In the fall of\n2015, NASA established the Formulation Assessment\n\nand Support Team (FAST), which was chartered by\nNASA to provide timely inputs for mission requirement formulation in support of the ARRM Requirements Closure Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) in\nmid-December of 2015, to assist in developing an initial list of potential mission investigations, and to provide input on potential hosted payloads and partnerships. The FAST included eighteen participants that\nwere selected from exactly 100 applications received\nfrom highly qualified individuals representing academia, industry, NASA, non-profit research institutes, and\nother organizations, and explored several aspects of\npotential science benefits and knowledge gain from\nARM. Expertise from the science, engineering, and\ntechnology communities was represented in exploring\nlines of inquiry related to key characteristics of the\nARRM reference target asteroid (2008 EV5) for engineering design purposes. Specific areas of interest\nincluded target origin, spatial distribution and size of\nboulders, surface geotechnical properties, boulder\nphysical properties, and considerations for boulder\nhandling, crew safety, and containment. In order to\nincrease knowledge gain potential from the mission,\nopportunities for partnerships and accompanying payloads were also investigated.\nFAST Report and Inputs: The FAST report and\nassociated public comments will be used to support\nmission requirements formulation and serve as an initial inquiry to the science and engineering communities\nrelating to the characteristics of the ARRM reference\ntarget asteroid. This report also provides a suggested\nlist of potential investigations sorted and grouped on\ntheir likely benefit to ARM and relevance to NASA\nscience and exploration goals. These potential investigations could be conducted to reduce mission risks and\nincrease knowledge return in the areas of science, planetary defense, asteroid resources and in-situ resource\nutilization (ISRU), and capability and technology\ndemonstrations. Participation in the FAST by non-civil\nservice personnel was limited to providing nonconsensus, non-voting input. The report represents the\nFAST\xe2\x80\x99s final product for the ARM. The FAST report\nwas divided into several sections with the first section\nproviding details about the purpose of the FAST, an\noverview of ARM, a summary of the study request, and\ninformation about the FAST selection process and\nmembership. The second section includes responses to\na set of high-priority questions that were derived from\nthe ARRM engineering team\xe2\x80\x99s risk analysis and were\nneeded to help design and develop the ARRM mission,\nspacecraft, and capture system. The questions were\ngrouped into seven topics and the major findings for\neach question listed. In addition, this report includes\nan initial list of potential investigations that could be\n\nperformed by ARM (ARRM and ARCM) resulting\nfrom brainstorming activities by the FAST. Many of\nthe identified investigations require additional sensors,\nsubsystems, or operations, which are beyond the scope\nof the current program. These inputs are not intended\nto be inclusive of all possibilities, but were meant to\naid formulation and development of the ARRM, and\nreflect the FAST members\xe2\x80\x99 experience and expertise in\nsmall body missions and knowledge related to science,\nplanetary defense, asteroidal resources and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU), and relevant capabilities and\ntechnologies. The last two sections of the report includes a list of additional findings by the FAST in\ncombination with public input and a summary of relevant public inputs and comments received by the\nFAST. All public inputs directly relevant to ARM,\nincluding any additional comments received in response to the posting of this draft version, will be\nsummarized in the final version of the report and will\nbe posted in their entirety on the FAST website:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/feature/arm-fast.\nSupport of Future ARM Activities: As of December 2015, the FAST has been formally disbanded.\nHowever, plans have been made to stand up an ARM\nInvestigation Team (IT), which will be formed in mid2016 with a call for membership expected in April of\n2016. The multidisciplinary IT will assist with the definition and support of mission investigations, support\nARM program-level and project-level functions, provide technical expertise, and support NASA Headquarters interactions with the technical communities\nthrough mission formulation, mission design and vehicle development, and mission implementation.\n\n'
