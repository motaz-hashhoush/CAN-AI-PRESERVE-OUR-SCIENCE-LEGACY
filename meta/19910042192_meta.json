The FACE is supposed to be a 14-ft long articulate structure with 4 degrees of freedom, consisting of shoulder pitch and yaw, elbow pitch, and wrist pitch. Kinematics of the FACE was simulated to obtain data on arm operation, function, workspace and interaction. Payload capture ability was modeled. The simulation indicates the capability for detailed kinematic simulation and payload capture ability analysis, and the feasibility of real-time simulation was determined. In addition, the potential for interactive real-time training through integration of the simulation with various interface controllers was revealed. At this stage, the flexibility of the arm was not yet considered.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19910042192, "endDate": "1990-02-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS"}}, "meetingId": "71dd685c9b934c0c9377903f0c4f9b98", "id": "4a3d5c7d1751407dbfab4ed2773f933b"}], "name": "Annual Rocky Mountain Guidance and Control Conference", "location": "Keystone, CO", "id": "71dd685c9b934c0c9377903f0c4f9b98", "startDate": "1990-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910042192, "id": "4c0ce2894eb84cceab94e33c0666c616", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
