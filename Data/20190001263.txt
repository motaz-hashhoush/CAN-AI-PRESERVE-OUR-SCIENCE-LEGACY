BARBARA\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nThe gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and icy giants (Uranus and\nNeptune) are \xef\xac\x82uid planets with atmospheres primarily made\nof hydrogen and helium. The part of their atmospheres accessible to remote sensing occupies only a small fraction of their\nradii (0.05%). Clouds and hazes form around the 1 bar altitude\npressure level and extend vertically, according to the thermochemical models, in a layer with a thickness of \xe2\x88\xbc200\xe2\x80\x93500 km\nwhere temperature increases with depth (usually known as\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cweather layer\xe2\x80\x9d). Clouds made of NH3 , NH4 SH, H2 O (in\nJupiter and Saturn), with the addition of CH4 (in Uranus and\nNeptune), cover the planet in strati\xef\xac\x81ed layers that are mixed\nwith unknown chromophore agents. Dynamical phenomena in\nthe weather layer shape different cloud patterns that de\xef\xac\x81ne the\nvisible appearance of these planets. In the thermal part of the\nspectrum clouds act as opacity sources providing brightness\ncontrasts. The ensemble of cloud morphologies in terms of\nshapes, sizes and albedos allows their use as tracers of the\natmospheric motions in the weather layer (Fig. 4.1). This is\nthe main tool employed so far to study the winds on these four\nplanets. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 present their relevant orbital and\nphysical properties.\nThe atmospheres of these planets extend to a substantial part\nof their volume. Hydrogen is mostly in its molecular form\n(H2 ), but at high pressures inside the planet (pressures above\n\xe2\x88\xbc1.4\xe2\x80\x933 Mbar) the separation between H2 molecules is of the\norder of their size, and hydrogen becomes an electrical conductor (a \xef\xac\x82uid metal). At p \xe2\x89\xa5 3 Mbar, dissociation of the\nmolecule leads to an atomic metallic state (liquid). At much\nhigher pressures theoretical calculations predict that hydrogen\nbecomes a degenerate plasma. At the centre of these planets a rocky core is expected to exist according to some formation scenarios (Pollack et al., 1996; Guillot, 2005). Both\ntheory and measurements of their gravitational \xef\xac\x81elds indicate\nthe presence of cores of 5\xe2\x80\x9310 Earth mass for Jupiter and 10\xe2\x80\x93\n20 Earth mass for Saturn. According to current models (see\nGuillot, 1999), the neutral atmosphere of Jupiter (a hydrogen\nand helium mixture) extends down to about \xe2\x88\xbc15 000 km in\nJupiter (0.2 of its radius) and in Saturn down to \xe2\x88\xbc30 000 km\n(0.5 of its radius). Uranus and Neptune are less massive than\nthe two gas giants, and models of their interiors indicate that,\nbelow the molecular atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, at\npressures around 0.1 Mbar (T \xe2\x88\xbc 2000 K), a transition occurs\nwhere a mixture of ices (water, ammonia and methane) in ionic\nstate is predicted, perhaps mixed with some heavier material.\nAccordingly, the neutral atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune\n\nTable 4.1.

Because of this\ngeometry two de\xef\xac\x81nitions of latitude are used: planetographic\nlatitude (\xcf\x95g ), de\xef\xac\x81ned by the angle from the perpendicular to the\ntangent to the surface intersecting the semi-major axis of the\nellipse, and planetocentric latitude (\xcf\x95c ), relative to the centre of\nthe ellipse (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2011). The two are related by the\nformula\ntan \xcf\x95g =\n\nRe\nRp\n\n2\n\ntan \xcf\x95c ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere Re and Rp are the equatorial and polar radius, respectively.

Earthproximal spacecraft, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope and\nHerschel Space Telescope, have also made sensitive measurements of disk-averaged thermal emission spectra that have\nbeen inverted to determine or constrain temperatures. Spatially\nresolved measurements of thermal emission have also been\nmade from ground-based observatories that track not only the\nvariability of temperatures spatially, but their variability in time.\nSimilar to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, the structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets can be divided into distinct regions,\nincluding the troposphere, where energy transport by winds\n\ndominates over radiative transport, and the stratosphere, where\nradiative transport dominates over convective transport. Above\nthe stratosphere is the thermosphere, a region where conduction becomes the dominant means of energy transport and\nmolecular diffusion takes place. Above the thermosphere is the\nionosphere, a region that includes charged particles among the\nneutral atmosphere. Below, we discuss our knowledge of temperature structures \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the bottom up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnlike the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s troposphere, where meridional transport\nprevents the atmosphere from becoming fully adiabatic, the\nlapse rates of outer-planet tropospheres appears to be fully consistent with adiabatic conditions. Because of their rapid rotation\nrates and large radii, Coriolis forces dominate convection, and\nmeridional \xef\xac\x82ow is much slower than zonal \xef\xac\x82ow. In addition,\neach of the outer planets except for Uranus emits more total\nenergy than it receives from the Sun and thus energy is dominated by thermal upwelling from below. Thus, in the absence of\ncondensation and latent heat effects, and assuming the perfect\ngas law, the lapse rate is\ndT\n\xe2\x88\x92mg\n=\n,\ndz\nCp\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere m is the mean molecular weight, g the local gravitational\nacceleration, and Cp is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure. The primary constituent of these atmospheres is molecular\nhydrogen, and its heat capacity is a function of temperature both\nbecause of its rotational degrees of freedom and because it is\na homonuclear molecule with two states with proton spins\nparallel (ortho-H2 ) and antiparallel (para-H2 ). Helium is the\nsecond most abundant molecule and, as a monatomic molecule,\nhas only translational degrees of freedom and a \xef\xac\x81xed molar\nspeci\xef\xac\x81c heat. For the deeper atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn,\nwhere water vapor condenses, and for Uranus and Neptune,\nwhose atmospheres are cold enough for methane to condense,\nthere are signi\xef\xac\x81cant changes to the lapse rate arising from latent\nheat release. Ammonia also condenses in these atmospheres,\nbut its latent heat effects are relatively small because of its\nsmall mixing ratio and small latent heat. The Galileo probe\nentered an anomalously dry and cloudless region of the atmosphere and temperatures measured during its descent through\nthe troposphere clearly traced the expected dry adiabat (Seiff\net al., 1998). Magalh\xc3\xa3es et al. (2002) used the Galileo probe\ntemperature measurements to derive a static stability that varies\nbetween 0.0 and 0.2 K km\xe2\x88\x921 in the 1\xe2\x80\x9322 bar region, with a measurement uncertainty of \xe2\x88\xbc0.1 K km\xe2\x88\x921 , although these values\nmay be unique to the anomalously dry region into which the\nprobe descended.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 74 \xe2\x80\x94 #96\n\n74\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nFigure 4.3 Giant planet imaging methods in time.

The weather layer, where wind data are available, is\nhighlighted by the red rectangle.\n\nFor the outer planets, the demarcation between the troposphere and stratosphere is particularly easy to delineate\n(Fig. 4.2). The stratospheres of all the outer planets have\nan \xe2\x80\x9cinverted\xe2\x80\x9d structure, with temperature rising with altitude. Thus, the temperature minimum of each planet (around\n100 mbar) is usually described as the tropopause, although\nit may be as much as a scale height higher than the location where the lapse rate becomes smaller than the adiabatic\none (around 400 mbar pressure). The rise in temperatures is\ncaused by radiative equilibrium with absorbed sunlight: ultraviolet radiation absorbed by gaseous photodissociation reactions,\nvisible radiation by stratospheric aerosols, and near-infrared\nradiation by methane gas absorption bands. This heating is balanced by radiative cooling in the mid-infrared by hydrocarbons,\nchie\xef\xac\x82y acetylene and ethane, byproducts of photodissociation\nof methane, as well as methane itself. The stratospheric temperature pro\xef\xac\x81les of the outer planets generally correspond to\nthe absorption characteristics expected of these sources of solar\nenergy deposition, to the extent that they can be measured independently. The rise of temperatures at even lower pressures in\nthe thermosphere is documented by ultraviolet occultation measurements and is not well understood, but is expected to be at\nleast partially the result of deposition of energy by breaking of\nupwelling waves.\n\ntwo planets and was the \xef\xac\x81rst constraint on the planet rotation,\nalthough representing atmospheric motions. However, to transform these rotation periods to wind velocities it is necessary to\nintroduce a reference frame linked to the true planet rotation.\nThe rotation rates of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are\ntaken to be those of their magnetic \xef\xac\x81elds, which are assumed\nto be tied to the deep planetary interiors and represent the bulk\nrotation of the planet (Table 4.2). The rotation of the magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld can be measured indirectly by means of the modulated radio emission produced by accelerated charged particles\ntrapped in the \xef\xac\x81eld lines. This rotation system is known as\nSystem III in the four gaseous planets. In the case of Saturn,\nthe rotation axis and magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld are closely aligned, making\nit dif\xef\xac\x81cult to establish the radio rotation period. In addition,\nit has been found that Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s rotation System III, based on\nthe radio rotation period, varies with time (on the order of\n15 minutes) and splits into different values in the northern and\nsouthern hemispheres, apparently due to complex interactions\nin its ionosphere and magnetosphere that are not fully understood (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2005; Gurnett et al., 2010). Theoretical\nestimates using the shape of the planet (Anderson and Schubert,\n2007), potential vorticity (Read et al., 2009) and gravitational\nmoments (Helled et al., 2015) produce rotation periods that\nare 5\xe2\x80\x937 minutes faster than the Voyager measurement. Until\na de\xef\xac\x81nitive rotation rate is obtained, the recommended value\nfor Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s rotation rate is that measured during the Voyager \xef\xac\x82ybys in 1980 and 1981 to make previous atmospheric\ndynamic studies coherent. The zero longitude for System III on\neach planet is also arbitrary, but is de\xef\xac\x81ned by the International\nAstronomical Union (Archinal et al., 2011).\n\n4.3 PLANETARY ROTATION AND REFERENCE\nFRAMES\nIt has been established since early in the twentieth century that\nthe motions of cloud features in the Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres are east\xe2\x80\x93West (zonal), and that their rotation periods in\nthe space frame (the time needed to make a full rotation around\nthe planet) are shorter at the equatorial latitudes than for the rest\nof the planet.

Wind measurements of Saturn were restricted to the occurrence of large-scale\nstorms only at a few latitudes. Therefore, the details of the wind\nsystems of both planets remained poorly known until Voyagers 1 and 2 \xef\xac\x82ew past Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980\xe2\x80\x9381.\nAccurate and tabulated zonal winds for Jupiter and Saturn have\nbeen published by Limaye (1986) and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n(2000) respectively. The Galileo Probe entered Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere in 1995, allowing in situ measurements of velocities at a\nsingle equatorial location (Atkinson et al., 1998). Observations\nfrom the Galileo orbiter led to precise measurements of Jovian\nwinds over some localized areas near the equator and large\nvortices like the Great Red Spot (Vasavada et al., 1998). The\nCassini spacecraft obtained further high-resolution observations of Jupiter in 2000 (Porco et al., 2003) \xe2\x80\x93 see below. The\nNew Horizons mission to Pluto \xef\xac\x82ew by Jupiter in 2007, providing high-resolution wind data for particular latitudes (Reuter\net al., 2007). Cassini has been successfully observing Saturn\nfor several years, obtaining several full zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les at\n\ndifferent cloud altitudes (Porco et al., 2005; Vasavada et al.,\n2006; Choi et al., 2009; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2011b).\nFigure 4.3 and Tables 4.4 and 4.5 summarize the available\nsources used to obtain wind data for the giant planets. Intermediate periods of time between the different space missions have\nbeen partially covered by observations obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The \xef\xac\x81rst Jupiter image set from\nHST was obtained in 1991, and zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les have been\nobtained over several years as summarized in Table 4.4. Hubble also observed Saturn before Cassini arrived at the planet,\nand the HST results are summarized by S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n(2003, 2004).\nAdditionally, high-resolution ground-based observations of\nthe giant planets have become possible in recent times with the\nadvent of fast CCD and CMOS cameras that allow \xef\xac\x81lming of the\nplanet to obtain a stream of frames that can be selected in terms\nof their quality and coregistered into a high signal-to-noise ratio\nimage that can reveal small-scale cloud features. This \xe2\x80\x9clucky\nimaging\xe2\x80\x9d technique (Law et al., 2006) is currently used by a\nbroad community of amateur observers resulting in frequent\nobservations of Jupiter and Saturn with successful retrievals\nof full zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les for Jupiter (Barrado-Izagirre et al.,\n2013) and detailed studies of storms and large-scale disturbances (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2012).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 76 \xe2\x80\x94 #98\n\n76\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nVoyager Data\nThe NASA Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft performed the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand\nTour\xe2\x80\x9d of the outer solar system. Voyager 1\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory was\nplanned for encounters with Jupiter (March 5, 1979) and Saturn (November 12, 1980), and Voyager 2 performed \xef\xac\x82ybys of\nJupiter (July 9, 1979), Saturn (August 25, 1981), Uranus (January 24, 1986) and Neptune (August 25, 1989). Data were gathered over about three months centered on the encounter date.\nWind studies were essentially done with two instruments.\nImaging Science System (ISS) This consisted of narrow-angle\n(focal length = 1502.4 mm, f/8.5, instrument FOV = 0.424\xe2\x97\xa6 ) and\nwide-angle (focal length = 200.5 mm, f/3.5, instrument FOV =\n3.169\xe2\x97\xa6 ) vidicon cameras with a photoconductive Se\xe2\x80\x93S detector.\nBecause of the optical distortion, a grid-dot pattern was used\nwith appropriate software for navigation (camera pointing). The\nnarrow-angle camera was equipped with a set of six broadband\n\xef\xac\x81lters covering the spectral range 0.28\xe2\x80\x930.64 \xce\xbcm, and the wideangle camera incorporated seven \xef\xac\x81lters covering the spectral\nrange 0.35\xe2\x80\x930.64 \xce\xbcm but incorporating a narrow sodium line \xef\xac\x81lter and a methane absorption band \xef\xac\x81lter at 619 nm. Details of\nthe instrument can be found in Smith et al. (1977).\nInfrared Spectroscopy and Radiometry Investigation (IRIS)\nThis consisted of two Michelson interferometers covering the\nspectral ranges 17\xe2\x80\x93170 \xce\xbcm and 1.4\xe2\x80\x9310 \xce\xbcm, and a radiometer\ncovering the range 0.4\xe2\x80\x931.2 \xce\xbcm. They shared a 50 cm Cassegrain\ntelescope with a circular \xef\xac\x81eld of view of 0.25\xe2\x97\xa6 (Hanel et al.,\n1977). Because of a small misalignment during the cruise phase,\nthe IRIS on Voyagers 1 and 2 operated only in the spectral\nrange 4\xe2\x80\x9355 \xce\xbcm, with a lower responsivity at some wavelengths\nin the Voyager 2 case. This instrument provided infrared spectra\nthat allowed, among others, temperature measurements used to\nretrieve thermal winds (see Section 4.7.3).\n\nCassini Data\nThe NASA/ESA spacecraft Cassini\xe2\x80\x93Huygens \xef\xac\x82ew past Jupiter\non a near-equatorial trajectory in late 2000 / early 2001, with\nthe closest approach to the planet around 136 Jupiter radii on\nDecember 30 (Porco et al., 2003). Between October 1, 2000 and\nMarch 22, 2001 it obtained sevaral long sequences of observations of the planet. During Cassini\xe2\x80\x99s approach to Jupiter, most\nof the hemisphere visible to the spacecraft was illuminated by\nthe Sun. This provided an excellent opportunity to monitor the\nevolution of the whole atmosphere at visible wavelengths over\na two-month period up to the closest approach, which was done\nusing the narrow-angle camera. Such continuous global observations could not be taken by the Galileo spacecraft and will\nnot be possible with the forthcoming Juno spacecraft either.\nCassini went into Saturn orbit on June 30, 2004. The Saturn\napproach period from February to June 2004 and the \xef\xac\x81rst orbit\nfrom June to October 2004 provided relatively low-resolution\nmulti-spectral images at moderate phase angles. The best imaging sequences for winds were from 2005 and 2007, when\nlow to moderate phase-angle orbits provided high-resolution\nhemispheric or near-global coverage. Brief moderate-resolution\nimage sequences have been obtained in most other years. The\n\nCassini Saturn Orbiter includes three instruments that provide\ninformation on Saturn zonal winds.\nImaging Science Subsystem The ISS (Porco et al., 2004) is a\nnear-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared imaging system with\nwide- and narrow-angle cameras covering a range of wavelengths from 200\xe2\x80\x931100 nm. The narrow-angle camera has a\n0.35\xe2\x97\xa6 \xef\xac\x81eld of view (\xe2\x88\xbc6 \xce\xbcrad/pixel), and the wide-angle camera has a 3.5\xe2\x97\xa6 \xef\xac\x81eld of view (\xe2\x88\xbc60 \xce\xbcrad/pixel) with its lower\nwavelength limit at 380 nm. The \xef\xac\x81lters (see Table 8 in Porco\net al., 2004) include wide-bandpass \xef\xac\x81lters over the whole range\nof frequencies, and narrow-bandpass \xef\xac\x81lters at speci\xef\xac\x81c wavelengths of interest such as methane bands at 619, 728, and\n889 nm, and H-\xce\xb1/lightning at 656 nm. Visible images correspond primarily to re\xef\xac\x82ected light from Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s\ncloud tops and methane band \xef\xac\x81lters are sensitive to hazes in\nthe upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The clouds and\nhazes can be tracked between images using manual feature\ntracking, line displacement correlation tracking or automated\nfeature tracking methods to retrieve estimates of wind speeds\nat each altitude. For Jupiter, a subset of the Jupiter ISS images\ntaken near closest approach have been preprocessed, mapped\nonto a longitude\xe2\x80\x93latitude grid and made generally available for\nanalysis via the NASA Planetary Data System (Vasavada et al.,\n2008). This dataset spans almost four Jupiter rotation periods in\nmid-December 2000 covering the time when the Sun\xe2\x80\x93Jupiter\xe2\x80\x93\nCassini angle was close to zero. These images were taken in\nthe 455 nm blue BL1, 750 nm continuum CB2, and 727 nm\nand 889 nm methane MT2 and MT3 \xef\xac\x81lters, every 63 min as\nthe planet rotated below the spacecraft. Several authors have\nused this dataset to track clouds and study various features of\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and zonal jets (Salyk et al., 2006; Choi and\nShowman, 2011; Galperin et al., 2014b), as will be discussed in\ndetail later. An example of this kind of analysis is shown in\nFig. 4.4 from Galperin et al. (2014b).\nSeveral studies of Saturn jets based on Cassini ISS images\nare also available (Porco et al., 2005; Vasavada et al., 2006;\nDel Genio et al., 2007; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2007; Garc\xc3\xadaMelendo et al., 2009, 2010, 2011b; Del Genio and Barbara,\n2012), with data obtained on different dates for different latitudes, and with relevant results for the vertical structure of\nthe jets and assessments of their temporal stability and possi-\n\nFigure 4.4 Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s cloud-level velocity \xef\xac\x81eld as observed by Cassini\non December 11\xe2\x80\x9312, 2000.

Complete tabulated wind pro\xef\xac\x81les in the\ncloud deck and upper hazes based on \xef\xac\x81ve years of Cassini ISS\ndata are given by Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al. (2011b).\nVisual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer The VIMS\n(Brown et al., 2004) is also used for feature tracking but at the\ndeeper ammonium hydrosul\xef\xac\x81de cloud level in 5 \xce\xbcm images\n(Baines et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2009). Unlike ISS, which can\nimage for multiple Saturn rotations near apoapsis, VIMS can\nonly produce images suitable for tracking during brief periods\nnot far from periapsis. Near-global VIMS mapping of Saturn\nwas performed in 2006, with speci\xef\xac\x81c latitude bands sampled in\nfeature tracks at other times during the mission.\nComposite Infrared Spectrometer The CIRS (Flasar et al.,\n2004b) derives latitudinal temperature gradients in the upper\ntroposphere and stratosphere from thermal infrared spectral\nradiances (Flasar et al., 2004a, 2005; Fletcher et al., 2007, 2010;\nLi et al., 2013), from which mean zonal winds can be derived\nusing the thermal wind equation. CIRS is a Fourier transform spectrometer sensitive to wavenumbers 10\xe2\x80\x931400 cm\xe2\x88\x921\n(7 \xce\xbcm to 1 mm wavelengths) with a spectral resolution of 0.5\xe2\x80\x93\n15.5 cm\xe2\x88\x921 . The far-infrared range (10\xe2\x80\x93600 cm\xe2\x88\x921 ) is covered by\na polarization interferometer, and the mid-infrared range (600\xe2\x80\x93\n1400 cm\xe2\x88\x921 ) by a Michelson interferometer. In both cases the\n\xef\xac\x81eld of view is much smaller than the ISS. CIRS has two\nfar-infrared detectors with a 3.9 mrad \xef\xac\x81eld of view and ten\nmid-infrared detectors with a 0.273 mrad \xef\xac\x81eld of view. The\ninstrument can take data in both nadir and limb viewing modes.\nCIRS data can be used in two main ways relevant to zonal jets.\nThree-dimensional temperature \xef\xac\x81elds can be combined with\nwind data and the thermal wind equation to derive winds at\nlevels where none can be retrieved directly (see Sections 4.7.2\nand 4.7.3; e.g., Flasar et al., 2004b). The temperature \xef\xac\x81elds\nobtained from CIRS data can also be used \xe2\x80\x93 in principle \xe2\x80\x93 to calculate heat transport diagnostics such as u T and v T . These\ndiagnostics are used to determine the potential energy transfer\nterms in the Lorenz atmospheric energy cycle (Lorenz, 1955),\nwhich can be used to determine how important different instabilities are in driving the zonal jets.\n\nFigure 4.5 Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s bands.

Red is for thermal IR radiation from the\nnight-side of the planet. Green and blue correspond to solar radiation\nin near-infrared wavelengths re\xef\xac\x82ected from the southern hemisphere\nof the planet and its rings. Credit: NASA/JPL.\n\n4.5 JUPITER AND SATURN:\nMETEOROLOGICAL FEATURES\nThe visible appearance of both Jupiter and Saturn is dominated by the presence of zonal (east\xe2\x80\x93west) bands of alternating\nalbedo, axisymmetric with the rotation axis. This pattern is\nformed by \xe2\x80\x9cwhite\xe2\x80\x9d (high-albedo) bands called \xe2\x80\x9czones\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9creddish\xe2\x80\x9d (lower-albedo) bands known as \xe2\x80\x9cbelts\xe2\x80\x9d that remain at\napproximately \xef\xac\x81xed latitudes year to year (Fig. 4.5). A similar\npattern is replicated at lower levels, as observed in thermalinfrared images (Fig. 4.6). Immersed within the bands is a\nplethora of cloud structures, some coherent, some turbulent or\nchaotic, from small and short-evolution timescales to large and\nlong-evolution timescales (Fig. 4.7). Discrete meteorological\nfeatures can be classi\xef\xac\x81ed accordingly in the following basic\ntypes (Fig. 4.8).\n\nFigure 4.7 Horizontal and temporal dynamical scales observed on\nJupiter and Saturn. The relevant length scales are the planetary radius\n(Rp ), Rossby deformation radius (LD ), Rhines scale (L\xce\xb2 ) and vertical\nscale height (H). See S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega (2011) for de\xef\xac\x81nitions.\n\nCoherent Vortices Large-scale and long-lived stable oval\nspots, most of them with anticyclonic vorticity, such as the\nGreat Red Spot or the White Ovals (later BA) on Jupiter, or\nthe Brown Spots (BS) and North Polar Spot (NPS) on Saturn.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 78 \xe2\x80\x94 #100\n\n78\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nFigure 4.8 Meteorological features on Jupiter (a\xe2\x80\x93d) and Saturn (e\xe2\x80\x93h).

(h) Normal vortices on Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s south hemisphere. All images are false color. Credit: NASA/JPL/ESA.\n\nCoherent cyclones are in general more elongated with shorter\nlifetimes, such as the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbarges\xe2\x80\x9d on Jupiter.\nConvective Storms Rapidly evolving spots that change their\nbrightness and size (from small to large features) in a matter\nof few days, indicative of strong moist convective storms with\nassociated lightning that can be observed on the night-side of\nthe planet for Jupiter (Little et al., 1999; Gierasch et al., 2000)\nand Saturn (Dyudina et al., 2010), and in extreme cases also\nin the day-side (Dyudina et al., 2013). On Jupiter, the storms\nand adjacent areas constitute the only locations where clear\nspectroscopic signatures of water (Simon-Miller et al., 2000)\nor ammonia ices have been found (Baines et al., 2002; Reuter\net al., 2007). On Saturn, the large Great White Spot of 2010\nand 2011 (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2011; Sayanagi et al., 2013)\nprovided a clear indication of ammonia and water ice particles\n(Sromovsky et al., 2013). Models of moist convection for the\nstrongest storms on both planets (Hueso and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega,\n2001, 2004) require water condensation instead of ammonia\ncondensation as the energy source for the storms in order to\nexplain their cloud-top altitude and observed phenomonology.\nPlanetary-Scale Disturbances These are the most impressive features on Jupiter and Saturn since they can change\nthe entire aspect of a zone or belt. The atmospheres of both\nplanets develop atmospheric perturbations that can grow into\nplanetary-scale disturbances that grow to cover a full latitudinal\nband of the planet. Jupiter presents such disturbances in its\nNorth Temperate Belt (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2008a, 2017)\nand South Temperate Belt (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 1996); see\nFig. 4.9. Both start with one or several convective features that\nproduce fresh white clouds that are sheared by the zonal winds\n(Fletcher et al., 2017). Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere develops larger disturbances about once every 30 years in eruptions called \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\n\nWhite Spots\xe2\x80\x9d (GWS) or Great Storms (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 1994).\nThe 1990 GWS occurred at the equator of the planet and was\nobserved with the HST (Barnet et al., 1992) and from groundbased telescopes (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 1991) showing the\ninteraction of the bright storm nucleus with the ambient winds.\nThe last GWS started in December 2010 at north mid-latitudes\n\nFigure 4.9 Large-scale disturbances on Jupiter and Saturn. (a) Double\neruption in the North Temperate Belt in 2007 (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.,\n2008a) with two convective features producing a turbulent wake in the\nfastest zonal jet on Jupiter.

(c) Set of Cassini ISS\nobservations of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s Great White Spot evolution (Sayanagi et al.,\n2013).\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 79 \xe2\x80\x94 #101\n\nGas Giants\nand its evolution was followed in detail from Cassini observations (Sayanagi et al., 2013) and high-temporal sampling from\nthe ground (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2011; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.,\n2012). The disturbed atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn take\nabout a year to restore to their normal appearance, and the\ndisturbances seem to modify only slightly the zonal jets at their\nlatitudinal location.\nWave-Like Features At the equatorial boundary of the North\nEquatorial Belt of Jupiter there is a system of 10\xe2\x80\x9312 large-scale\ndark projections (high emission at 5 \xce\xbcm, called \xe2\x80\x9chot-spots\xe2\x80\x9d) that\nhave been interpreted as a large-scale trapped equatorial Rossby\nwave (Allison, 1990; Arregi et al., 2006; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al.,\n2011a). Other large-scale wave systems on Jupiter are observed\nin the South Equatorial Belt (Simon-Miller et al., 2012), in the\nNorth Equatorial Belt (at 15\xe2\x97\xa6 N) (Li et al., 2006) and in the\npolar hazes in both hemispheres (Sanchez-Lavega et al., 1998a;\nBarrado-Izagirre et al., 2008). Short-scale waves have also been\nobserved in the equatorial region of the planet since the Voyagers (Hunt and Muller, 1979) and have been interpreted as\ngravity waves (Flasar and Gierasch, 1986; Reuter et al., 2007;\nArregi et al., 2009). Other similar wave systems observed at\nthe equator during the New Horizons \xef\xac\x82yby (Reuter et al., 2007)\nhave been interpreted as either gravity waves or Kelvin waves\n(Simon et al., 2015), or as equatorial Kelvin waves (Simon\net al., 2015). Planetary waves on Saturn are long-lived and well\nlocalized in latitude, the most notorious being in the northern hemisphere: the \xe2\x80\x9cribbon\xe2\x80\x9d (Smith et al., 1982; Sromovsky\net al., 1983; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2002; Sayanagi et al., 2010b)\nand the polar hexagon (Godfrey, 1990; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.,\n2014).\nPolar Cyclones At visible wavelengths and latitudes above\n87\xe2\x97\xa6 , both poles of Saturn show strong cyclonic vortices that\nenclose a region less cloudy than their surroundings (S\xc3\xa1nchezLavega et al., 2006; Dyudina et al., 2008; Antu\xc3\xb1ano et al., 2015;\nSayanagi et al., 2017); see Fig. 4.8.\n\n4.6 WIND MEASUREMENTS FROM CLOUD\nMOTIONS\nThe wind \xef\xac\x81eld at cloud-top level for Jupiter and Saturn has\nbeen inferred by tracking the motions of cloud features in a\ntime sequence of images. This assumes that the cloud features behave as passive tracers. Passive cloud tracers must\npreserve their integrity over the time interval used to measure their motion. Since the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn have zonal jets, large synoptic-scale vortices and large\nstorms, the motions of features in different meteorological structures at the same latitude can be quite different.\nLarge details such as synoptic-scale vortices, convective\nclouds or turbulent regions may introduce spurious components in velocity measurements of the zonal jets and must\nbe avoided (Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2001),\nbut high-resolution images of those structures can resolve\ntheir internal motions (Choi et al., 2007; Hueso et al.,\n2009).\n\n79\n\nZonal winds can be measured for individual cloud tracers\nat the same latitude by measuring their longitudinal position at two different times. These measurements assume a\nparticular rotation frame for the planet, which is usually\nSystem III for Jupiter and Saturn, de\xef\xac\x81ned by their respective angular velocities (\xce\xa9III Jup = 870.5366420\xe2\x97\xa6 day\xe2\x88\x921 and\n\xce\xa9III Sat = 810.7939024\xe2\x97\xa6 day\xe2\x88\x921 ; Seidelmann et al., 2007). If the\nimages have been adequately navigated to minimize position\nerrors, the tracer is at a latitude \xcf\x95c , the initial and \xef\xac\x81nal longitude positions are \xce\xbb 1 and \xce\xbb 2 (in degrees), and the respective\nmeasurement times are t 1 and t 2 , then the velocity with respect\nto the reference rotation frame is\n2\xcf\x80R(\xcf\x95c ) cos(\xcf\x95c ) \xce\xbb 2 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb 1\nu(\xcf\x95c ) =\n.\n(4.4)\n360\xe2\x97\xa6\nt2 \xe2\x88\x92 t1\nEstimated errors in the measurement of u(\xcf\x95c ) are given by\nthe quotient between longitude measurement errors and the time\ndifference t 2 \xe2\x88\x92t 1 . Therefore, the larger the time base, the smaller\nthe velocity error. However, small cloud features are usually\ndeformed and destroyed by horizontal wind shear, interactions\nwith other tracers, and other dynamical processes, and the time\nbase usually cannot be arbitrarily extended for more than a single planetary rotation. Manual pointing of individual cloud tracers is also prone to subjective errors in identifying the position\nof a small feature, but these misidenti\xef\xac\x81cations are usually obvious once the wind vectors are examined in the context of nearby\nfeatures. If the tracer is long-lived, a much better procedure to\nestimate zonal velocity is to obtain several longitude measurements to extend the time base as much as possible, and then\nestimate the quotient (\xce\xbb 2 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb 1 )/(t 2 \xe2\x88\x92 t 1 ) by linear regression,\nsubstantially reducing errors associated with the drift velocity.\nThe bigger downside to manual measurements is the low density of measured vectors.\n4.6.1 One-Dimensional Brightness Correlation\nAutomatic methods for extracting zonal velocities have been\nhighly successful in the measurement of wind \xef\xac\x81elds in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. For time intervals short enough,\nmost of the cloud tracers at a given latitude will survive more\nor less intact but will be shifted in longitude according to the\nbackground zonal wind. Images can be cylindrically projected\nonto rectangular maps, usually correcting the atmospheric limbdarkening by using either a Lambert function, an empirical\nMinnaert correction (Minnaert, 1941) or a high-pass \xef\xac\x81lter. The\ncomparison can be performed using the cross-correlation function\nN\n\nR f g (\xcf\x95, \xce\xbb j ) =\n\nf \xcf\x95 (\xce\xbb i )g\xcf\x95 (\xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb j ),\n\n(4.5)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere f \xcf\x95 (\xce\xbb i ) and g\xcf\x95 (\xce\xbb i ) are the albedo functions at the discrete\nlongitude values \xce\xbb i at the speci\xef\xac\x81c latitude \xcf\x95.\nThe maximum of the cross-correlation function gives us the\nlongitude shift due to zonal wind motion, and the zonal \xef\xac\x82ow\nspeed is measured from Eq. (4.4). This procedure produces an\naverage zonal mean velocity, and the set of retrieved velocities\nat a given pressure level for a complete set of latitudes is usually called the average zonal mean velocity pro\xef\xac\x81le. Figure 4.10\nsketches the procedure. Variations of this technique have been\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 80 \xe2\x80\x94 #102\n\n80\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nFigure 4.11 Two-dimensional image correlation.

This technique works with cylindrical or polar projections of high-resolution images, which can be compared using a\ntwo-dimensional version of the cloud correlation algorithm. A\nsketch of how this procedure works appears in Fig. 4.11. The\n\xef\xac\x81rst image is divided into small subimages f with N \xc3\x97 M pixels, ideally large enough to contain identi\xef\xac\x81able cloud features\nbut small enough to obtain high-resolution results.\nOnly data provided by spacecraft observations of Jupiter\nand Saturn and by some HST observations of Jupiter with the\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and WFPC2 and WFC3\ninstruments have the required spatial resolution. Typical results\ninclude measurements of well-de\xef\xac\x81ned cloud features with obvious outliers that are removed from the data using different criteria. Outliers can be produced by laminar elongated features\nor by the correlation coef\xef\xac\x81cient of a pixel box match being too\nsmall.

Selection of elongated boxes in the \xef\xac\x81rst image renders a\ntwo-dimensional cloud correlation algorithm similar to the onedimensional correlation algorithms discussed above.\nMeasurement errors scale roughly as the image resolution\ndivided by the time interval used, and the main uncertainties\ncome from small errors in image navigation and temporal evolution of the cloud features. Typical time separations are of the\norder of one planetary rotation (10 hr), allowing wind speeds to\nbe resolved to a level of 1 m s\xe2\x88\x921 . Images separated by 1\xe2\x80\x932 hr\ncan also be used to retrieve the internal wind \xef\xac\x81eld of large vortices, and high-resolution images (15 km per pixel) with short\ntime separations as small as 20 min have been used in a few\ncases (see, for instance, Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2013). In the latter cases error measurements of an individual tracer are of the\norder of 10 m s\xe2\x88\x921 , but using a larger time separation between\nimages is not generally possible since turbulent cloud features\ninside the large vortices of Jupiter rotate and distort severely in\njust one planetary rotation. The zonal average can be retrieved\nwith higher precision from statistics of the individual features.\nThere are other alternatives to direct image correlation.\nThose tested in Jupiter are a streamline method applying\none-dimensional correlation over streamlines (Sussman et al.,\n2010) and advection-corrected correlation image velocimetry\n(ACCIV), which has been tested successfully in Jupiter images\nseparated by 10 hr (Asay-Davis et al., 2009). Larger time differences at high spatial resolution are not possible due to the\nstrong distortion of cloud features in the turbulent atmospheres\nof Jupiter and Saturn in those timescales. The \xef\xac\x82uid dynamics\nliterature is very rich in iterative image deformation methods\nused in image velocimetry applications; the interested reader\nis referred to Scarano (2002) and references therein. Globally,\ntwo-dimensional correlation methods give a greater number of\nwind vectors than cloud tracking, although results generally\nrequire very high-quality data and averages along a latitude\nband are usually necessary to measure the zonal winds with the\nhighest possible precision.\n\n4.7 JUPITER AND SATURN: MEAN WIND AT\nCLOUD LEVEL\n4.7.1 Upper Cloud Level\nJupiter has between seven and eight jets per hemisphere at\nthe nominal ammonia cloud level (\xe2\x88\xbc700 mbar), as shown in\nFig. 4.12. Its distribution is not symmetrical and is dominated by a strong equatorial jet with maximum velocities of\n140 m s\xe2\x88\x921 . A particular feature of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s zonal wind system\nis the presence of a strong eastward jet at 24\xe2\x97\xa6 N with measured\nmaximum velocities between 120 m s\xe2\x88\x921 and 180 m s\xe2\x88\x921 (Maxworthy, 1984; Limaye, 1986; Simon, 1999; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo\nand S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2001; Asay-Davis et al., 2011; BarradoIzagirre et al., 2013; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2017; Tollefson\net al., 2017). There is no southern counterpart for the 24\xe2\x97\xa6 N\njet, only a \xe2\x88\xbc60 m s\xe2\x88\x921 jet at \xe2\x88\x9227\xe2\x97\xa6 S, very close to the location\nwhere the GRS sits (\xe2\x88\x9223\xe2\x97\xa6 ). Perhaps the GRS presence accounts\nfor the wind pro\xef\xac\x81le asymmetry at \xe2\x88\xbc \xc2\xb124\xe2\x97\xa6 latitudes, but the\nreason is unknown. Before the Cassini encounter with Jupiter\nin 2000, the equatorial jet always presented, from manual and\n\n81\n\nFigure 4.12 Jupiter zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les.

Detailed analysis of spacecraft and groundbased images after the year 2000 showed that Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s equatorial jet is actually symmetric with maximum velocities of\n140 m s\xe2\x88\x921 , but that the apparent asymmetry of the equatorial jet\nis due to the superposition of the westward phase velocity of a\ntrapped Rossby wave (Asay-Davis et al., 2011; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo\net al., 2011a; Barrado-Izagirre et al., 2013).\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst detailed zonal pro\xef\xac\x81les for Saturn were retrieved\nfrom Voyager data at optical wavelengths (Ingersoll et al., 1984;\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2000). The use of broadband color \xef\xac\x81lters did not allow an accurate determination of the pressure\nlevel that corresponded to the wind retrievals, but probably they\nwere close to the 500\xe2\x80\x93700 mbar level (probably the upper top of\nthe ammonia cloud; P\xc3\xa9rez-Hoyos and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2006a).\nHST observations produced partial data that was dif\xef\xac\x81cult to\ninterpret due to the presence of strong convective activity at the\nnorth equatorial region (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2003). Cassini\norbital insertion around Saturn in 2004 allowed the retrieval\nof detailed measurements of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s wind pro\xef\xac\x81le from pole\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 82 \xe2\x80\x94 #104\n\n82\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nto pole at several well-de\xef\xac\x81ned wavelengths, from the thermal\ninfrared at 5 \xce\xbcm to the main methane absorption bands and their\nadjacent continuums. This was followed by soundings of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le until the present time.\nFigure 4.13 summarizes the obtained zonal winds for Saturn\nfrom Voyager and Cassini data in optical wavelengths at the\ncloud-top level. Saturn shows an almost symmetric distribution\nof about six jet streams in each hemisphere. In contrast with\nJupiter, Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s equatorial jet is more intense and broader, with\nwind speeds that reach 400 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at the ammonia cloud level\n(\xe2\x88\xbc500 mbar) according to measurements derived from Cassini\ndata since 2005 (Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2011b). Measurements\nmade during the Voyager \xef\xac\x82ybys reveal that the equatorial\njet was possibly stronger then, with a peak velocity close to\n500 m s\xe2\x88\x921 . Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s wind distribution has other unique features\nnot found in Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s zonal wind system. While both planets\nhave similar broad eastward equatorial jets with a double symmetric peak structure, Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s equatorial jet is more complex\nwith the presence of an equatorially centered, narrow-peaked\njet that increases in intensity with altitude (Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo\net al., 2010). While the broad equatorial superrotation drops\nfrom \xe2\x88\xbc400 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at the ammonia cloud top deck (500 mbar) to\n300 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at the tropopause at 60 mbar between \xc2\xb120\xe2\x97\xa6 around\nthe equator, the narrow equatorial jet increases its strength\nfrom 380 to 440 m s\xe2\x88\x921 and might also be connected to a highaltitude stratospheric jet (Li et al., 2008). Temporal variability\nand strong vertical shears have been reported recently (S\xc3\xa1nchezLavega et al., 2016). This indicates that the equatorial dynamics of Saturn is more complex than that of Jupiter. Vertical\nwind shear was also detected at other jet peaks at mid-latitudes,\nbut with lower intensity due to the smaller pressure difference\nidenti\xef\xac\x81ed by the Cassini narrow-band \xef\xac\x81lters (between 100 mbar\nand 350 mbar; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2009). Another distinctive characteristic of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s zonal wind system is the presence of two strong vortices centered at the poles with maximum\nwind speeds of \xe2\x88\xbc120 m s\xe2\x88\x921 (north) and \xe2\x88\xbc160 m s\xe2\x88\x921 (south) at\n\xc2\xb188\xe2\x97\xa6 (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2006; Dyudina et al., 2008; Baines\net al., 2009; Antu\xc3\xb1ano et al., 2015; Sayanagi et al., 2017). The\nSouth Polar Vortex (SPV) presents an eye free of clouds and\na warm core mimicking some aspects of a terrestrial hurricane\n(Dyudina et al., 2008).\n4.7.2 Middle Cloud Level\nBelow the main upper cloud, wind measurements are more\nscarce. Cassini VIMS data at 5 \xce\xbcm are especially useful here\nbecause of its potential to probe deeper layers of the atmosphere. At 5 \xce\xbcm, Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s deep atmospheric cloud features are\nseen \xe2\x80\x9cbacklit\xe2\x80\x9d against the infrared emission, indicating that\nthese features are located anywhere in between the top of the\natmosphere and the 5 \xce\xbcm emission level. At this wavelength,\ncloud opacity is dominated by the NH4 SH cloud located at\nthe 2\xe2\x80\x934 bar altitude level (Baines et al., 2005; Momary et al.,\n2006), whereas the emission level is close to 5 bar (Bjoraker\net al., 2007).\nChoi et al. (2009) undertook an analysis of VIMS data of the\nSaturnian atmosphere from Cassini and adapted an automated\ncloud feature tracking algorithm to construct the zonal wind\npro\xef\xac\x81le of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere from VIMS data (Fig. 4.14).\n\nFigure 4.14 Scatter plot of zonal wind velocity vs latitude for\nSaturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere constructed from VIMS data (Choi et al., 2009).\nFor comparison, two other pro\xef\xac\x81les are shown: the blue line is from\nVoyager images (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2000), and the red line is\nfrom Cassini ISS images (Vasavada et al., 2006). Uncertainties for the\nVIMS measurements are \xc2\xb110 m s\xe2\x88\x921 , and are dependent on the amount\nof latitudinal wind shear.\n\nGenerally, the zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le from 5 \xce\xbcm VIMS data is\nroughly in agreement with the jet location and magnitude of\nprevious zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les from Voyager and Cassini, but\nmany substantial local differences appear at low and high\nlatitudes.\nVIMS images provide evidence for rapid equatorial \xef\xac\x82ow at\nthe jet core: clouds just north of the equator \xef\xac\x82ow at \xe2\x88\xbc500 m s\xe2\x88\x921 ,\nand perhaps even faster. This suggests that the near factor-oftwo reduction in speed relative to Voyager measurements for\nthe equatorial jet could be con\xef\xac\x81ned to the upper troposphere,\nand that VIMS may be sensing deeper levels of the jet at these\nlatitudes. However, some caution is needed with measurements\nof rapid \xef\xac\x82ow at the jet core (i.e. the cluster of points with\nu > 500 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at \xe2\x88\xbc1\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x97\xa6 N and 7\xe2\x97\xa6 S), as the equatorial region\ntypically lacks discrete high-contrast cloud features. Choi et al.\n(2009) noted that it is possible that the highest speeds could\ncorrespond to a local disturbance and may not be characteristic\nof the zonally averaged \xef\xac\x82ow. It seems clear that the equatorial\njet speed exceeds \xe2\x88\xbc400\xe2\x80\x93450 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at the pressure sensed by\nVIMS 5 \xce\xbcm images.\nAt higher latitudes, jets in the VIMS data are in remarkably\ngood agreement with zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les of the upper clouds\nfrom Voyager and Cassini. However, differences exist in the\npeak speeds measured at the jet cores, with the exception of\nthe jet near 45\xe2\x97\xa6 N, where the derived speeds from VIMS are\nnearly identical to those from Voyager. Furthermore, there is no\nuniversal increase or decrease of the peak velocities across all\njets between VIMS and the other wind pro\xef\xac\x81les. The jet cores at\n75\xe2\x97\xa6 N and 50\xe2\x97\xa6 S appear to be \xef\xac\x82owing faster than in the previous pro\xef\xac\x81les. The measurement at 75\xe2\x97\xa6 N is attributed to a cluster\nof clouds located north of a large dark spot feature, and these\nclouds appear to be embedded in a relatively wide westward\xef\xac\x82owing jet. At 50\xe2\x97\xa6 S, a cloud feature that is embedded in a\ndark stripe (presumably corresponding to a narrow jet stream)\nis the likely source for the VIMS measurement. It is unclear\nhow closely the motion of these features represent the ambi-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 83 \xe2\x80\x94 #105\n\nGas Giants\nent zonally averaged zonal \xef\xac\x82ow. The measurement at 60\xe2\x97\xa6 S also\nsupports the presence of apparent wind shear compared with\npast pro\xef\xac\x81les, though this measurement is less convincing from\nthe lack of repeat observations. One of the starkest differences\nbetween the VIMS zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le and previous pro\xef\xac\x81les is\nthe jet at 65\xe2\x97\xa6 N, which appears to be \xef\xac\x82owing at nearly half of\nthe speed of the jet at that latitude as seen by Voyager.\nUsing information gleaned from the ISS and VIMS zonal\nwind pro\xef\xac\x81les, and assuming that they originate from different\ndepths, constraints about the latitudinal temperature gradient\nof Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere can be obtained. Choi et al. (2009)\nassumed that the features tracked by ISS and VIMS are separated by a scale height. By using an uncertainty estimate of\n\xc2\xb110 m s\xe2\x88\x921 for the winds at both levels, they estimated an upper\nbound of \xe2\x88\xbc0.5 K/1000 km for \xe2\x88\x82T/\xe2\x88\x82 y. When extrapolated over\n5000\xe2\x80\x9310 000 km, the zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81les rule out latitudinal\ntemperature contrasts exceeding 2\xe2\x80\x935 K throughout most of the\natmosphere.\nHowever, apparent wind shear is present at certain jet cores.\nFaster wind speeds are found at deep levels at the equator and at\nthe 48\xe2\x97\xa6 S jet core. S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al. (2007) used methane\nand near-infrared \xef\xac\x81lter images from Cassini ISS and observed\nhigher-altitude features \xef\xac\x82owing at a slower speed compared to\nfeatures at the main cloud deck (\xe2\x88\xbc700 mbar), yielding a vertical\nwind shear \xe2\x88\x82u/\xe2\x88\x82z \xe2\x88\xbc 40 m s\xe2\x88\x921 per atmospheric scale height H\n(\xe2\x88\xbc50 km at the equator). Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al. (2009) extended\nthat work to show that vertical wind shear (estimated at 10 m s\xe2\x88\x921\nper atmospheric scale height H) is present at several southern\nhemisphere zonal jets (see also S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2016).\nHowever, if the features tracked by ISS and VIMS are separated by a scale height, the \xe2\x88\xbc100 m s\xe2\x88\x921 difference at the jet cores\nimplies a shear that is greater than the estimate from S\xc3\xa1nchezLavega et al. (2007) by a factor of 2\xe2\x80\x933. The wind shear implied\nby Choi et al. (2009) is also well above the \xe2\x88\xbc25 m s\xe2\x88\x921 per atmospheric scale height at the 500 mbar level estimated from CIRS\nthermal data by Flasar et al. (2005).\n\n83\n\ntudes can be estimated by applying the thermal wind equation\nusing knowledge of the meridional variability of temperatures\nand the wind pro\xef\xac\x81le at the cloud level. Since Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s winds are in geostrophic balance (Ro\n1), the vertical\nshear of the horizontal wind speed is related to the horizontal\ntemperature gradients by the thermal wind equation:\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x82vg\nR \xcb\x86\n=\nk \xc3\x97 \xe2\x88\x87pT\n\xe2\x88\x82p\npf\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere vg is the geostrophic wind, p is pressure, R is the speci\xef\xac\x81c\ngas constant, f is the Coriolis parameter and T is the temperature. For purely zonal motions in hydrostatic equilibirum this\nequation takes the form\nf\n\ng \xe2\x88\x82T\n\xe2\x88\x82u\n\xe2\x89\x88\xe2\x88\x92\n.\n\xe2\x88\x82z\nT \xe2\x88\x82y\n\n(4.7)\n\nThus, except for a narrow band near the equator where the\ngeostrophic approximation breaks down, measurements of the\nmeridional temperature gradient above the upper cloud layer\nallow us to determine the vertical structure of the geostrophic\nwind from the \xe2\x88\xbc1 bar altitude level (where the measured wind\npro\xef\xac\x81le from cloud tracking is used as reference) to the 1 mbar\naltitude level. From the thermal wind equation and thermal data\nfrom the IRIS instruments on the Voyagers (Gierasch et al.,\n1986; Magalhaes et al., 1990) and the CIRS instrument on\nCassini (Flasar et al., 2004a, 2005; Simon-Miller et al., 2006;\nLi et al., 2008), the zonal wind structure of Jupiter and Saturn\nshould largely decay some 3\xe2\x80\x934 scale heights above the level of\nthe cloud-tracked winds (Fig. 4.15).\n\n4.7.3 Winds Above Clouds\nCloud features detected in broadband images in the visual range\nare located at approximately the same altitude (although this\ndepends on latitude). A mean altitude pressure level of 750 mbar\ncan be considered as a reference for both planets (West, 2004),\nand differences in cloud tops for different features span much\nless than one scale height (H). However, at ultraviolet wavelengths (250\xe2\x80\x93350 nm) and in the deep methane absorption\nbands (890 nm and 2.3 \xce\xbcm), the upper hazes dominate the visual\naspect of the planet. Tracking the motions of discrete features\nin these images allows direct measurements of the zonal winds\nup to a scale height above the main cloud deck and evaluation\nof the vertical shear of the zonal wind \xe2\x88\x82u/\xe2\x88\x82z (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega\net al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2011b).\nAdditionally, tracking of the debris left at higher altitudes by\nlarge impacts in Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere in 1994 (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega\net al., 1995) and 2009 (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2010) have been\nused to derive the zonal and meridional components of the wind\nabove the main cloud up to 20 mbar altitude level.\nIn the absence of detectable particles in the stratospheres and\nupper atmospheres of the giant planets, zonal winds at these alti-\n\nFigure 4.15 Vertical meridional cross-section of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s thermal\nwind (upper panel) and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s thermal winds above cloud-top level\nin the northern (left) and southern (right) hemispheres.

Conrath et al. (1990) calculated stratospheric heating through absorption of solar radiation\nby CH4 gas alone. They predicted that the residual mean circulation, also known as the diabatic circulation, in the stratospheres of all the giant planets would consist of air rising over\nthe sub-solar latitude and descending over the poles. For all the\ngiant planets except Jupiter, whose obliquity is very small, this\nimplies that the latitude corresponding to the location of rising\nair would be seasonally dependent. West et al. (1992) considered additional heating by absorption of ultraviolet sunlight by\nstratospheric hazes near Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s poles. In their model, air rises\nover the poles above the 10 mbar level and descends at the equator. At lower altitudes, air descends over both poles. This model\nthus predicts equatorward motion above the 10 mbar level and\npoleward motion below this level. Another study, by Moreno\nand Sedano (1997), used revised haze and methane absorption\nmodels to yield a meridional \xef\xac\x82ow structure closer to those of\nConrath et al. (1990). Clearly these models are highly dependent on the properties and distribution of absorbing gases and\nhazes. Thus, we would expect a similar sensitivity to gases and\nhazes for Saturn, but less so for Uranus and Neptune, which do\nnot have signi\xef\xac\x81cant UV-absorbing polar hazes.\nThe deposition of particles into the stratosphere and upper\natmosphere of Jupiter by the collision of several fragments of\nComet Shoemaker\xe2\x80\x93Levy 9 in 1994 provided an unexpected\nchance to trace circulation high above its tropospheric cloud\ndeck (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 1995; Beebe, 1996). All of the\nmodels of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere discussed above predicted poleward motion of air between the 10 and 100 mbar pressure levels,\nwith cometary debris at the 45\xe2\x97\xa6 S impact latitude expected to\ndrift southward (Friedson et al., 1999). Instead it drifted toward\nthe equator, reaching a latitude of 20\xe2\x97\xa6 S by 1997 (SanchezLavega et al., 1998a), and trace gases introduced by the impact\ndrifted past the equator (Lellouch et al., 2002).\nDetailed summaries of stratospheric and upper-atmospheric\ncirculation are given by Irwin (2009) and recent reviews of\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmospheres by Ingersoll et al. (2004) and Moses et al.\n(2004) and of Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere by Del Genio et al. (2009).\n4.7.4 Deep Winds\nWe have almost no direct information about the vertical structure u(z) of zonal winds for the two gas giants Jupiter and\nSaturn. The only direct experimental result was obtained by\nthe Galileo Probe Mission on July 13, 1995, which entered\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere at a planetographic latitude of 7.5\xe2\x97\xa6 N and\nsent information, among other magnitudes, of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s vertical wind structure down to the 21 bar level (Atkinson et al.,\n1998); see Fig. 4.16. Measurements indicated that at that latitude, Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s zonal wind speed increased up to 180 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at\n5 bar, but then it remained more or less constant down to 21 bar.\nIt is not clear whether these results are representative of the\nvertical wind shear at other Jupiter latitudes. The atmospheric\nprobe was released into a 5 \xce\xbcm hot spot, a particular region\ndominated by the presence of a planetary-scale Rossby wave.\nNumerical experiments suggested that wind measurements may\nbe affected by the presence of the Rossby wave and therefore it\n\nFigure 4.16 Vertical pro\xef\xac\x81le of the wind speed as measured by the\nGalileo probe (Atkinson et al., 1998) that entered a \xe2\x80\x9chot spot\xe2\x80\x9d region \xe2\x80\x93\nthe circle in the bright area in the inset image (Orton et al., 1996).\n\nis not representative of the whole planet (Showman and Dowling, 2000).\nIndirect evidence of slightly increasing winds under the cloud\ntops, in the upper tropospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, are given\nby observation of planetary-scale convective storms. These\nare supposed to originate at the water cloud level at \xe2\x88\xbc6 bar\non Jupiter (Hueso and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2001), and \xe2\x88\xbc10 bar\non Saturn (Hueso and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2004). Simultaneous\nknowledge of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s wind pro\xef\xac\x81les and storm\ndynamics at the times of different planetary-scale disturbances\n(the 2007 North Temperate Belt Disturbance on Jupiter and the\nSaturn 2010 Great White Spot; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2008a,\n2011) suggest that winds at the water cloud level moved, in\nabsolute terms, about 10 m s\xe2\x88\x921 faster than those at the cloud-top\nlevel (Fig. 4.17).\nFurther exploration of the vertical u(z) structure in the\nweather layer can be performed by numerical modeling of the\ndynamical interaction between the cloud-top atmosphere and\nmeteorological features that extend in depth like planetaryscale storms and large-scale vortices for both Jupiter (Garc\xc3\xadaMelendo et al., 2005; Legarreta and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2008;\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2008a; Morales-Juberias and Dowling, 2005) and Saturn (Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2007, 2013; del\nR\xc3\xado-Gaztelurrutia et al., 2010; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2011).\nFor this purpose, the dry-air global circulation EPIC model\n(Dowling et al., 1998) has been intensively used. For an adiabatic atmosphere like in the EPIC model, potential vorticity\n(PV) is conserved following the motion of \xef\xac\x82uid parcels. In\nmany simulation experiments, PV has been successfully used\nas a proxy for the observed small-scale structure of the visible cloud-top ammonia clouds. The vertical structure of the\nzonal winds does not need to be uniform at all latitudes for\nboth giant planets, but most numerical experiments are able to\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 85 \xe2\x80\x94 #107\n\nGas Giants\n\nFigure 4.17 Zonal velocity of the convective storm plumes in\n(a) Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s 2007 NTBD (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2008a) and\n(b) Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s 2010 GWS (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2011). Different lines\ncorrespond to the zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le for different periods of time\nfollowing the evolution of the planetary-scale storm.\n\ncorrectly reproduce the observed morphology and dynamics. In\nthe case of Jupiter, good results are obtained with non-decaying\nwinds well below the solar penetration level in most simulation\nexperiments, whose magnitude ranges between \xe2\x88\xbc4 m s\xe2\x88\x921 H \xe2\x88\x921\nand \xe2\x88\xbc15 m s\xe2\x88\x921 H \xe2\x88\x921 at 6 bar, depending on the point of the zonal\nwind pro\xef\xac\x81le being considered. In the case of Saturn, simulations\nagree on constant or slightly decaying winds between 0.5 bar\nand 10 bar, when vortices or the 2010 GWS storm are simulated (see references above). In all these cases vertical wind\nshear is about \xe2\x88\x925 m s\xe2\x88\x921 H \xe2\x88\x921 , and depends on the latitude being\nconsidered. Nevertheless, the wind may be slightly increasing\nwith depth at the jet peaks, as suggested by numerical works by\nSayanagi and Showman (2007) and Sayanagi et al. (2010b).\n\n4.8 JUPITER AND SATURN: EDDY WIND\nCOMPONENTS AT CLOUD LEVELS\nThe zonal jets on Jupiter and Saturn are the result of the competition between processes that supply momentum to and remove\nmomentum from the jets. The jets are remarkably stable over\nlong time intervals (Section 4.9), implying that momentum\nsources and sinks are in approximate balance. Modeling studies\n\n85\n\nhave suggested a variety of physical mechanisms by which the\njets might be maintained. These include momentum transport\nby the mean meridional circulation and by covariances between\ninstantaneous local \xef\xac\x82uctuations (\xe2\x80\x9ceddies\xe2\x80\x9d) in the zonal wind\nand the meridional or vertical wind components.\nDeviations of instantaneous horizontal zonal (u ) and meridional (v ) wind velocities from the zonal mean were \xef\xac\x81rst\nretrieved for Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s visible cloud levels from manual tracking of cloud features in Voyager 1 and 2 \xef\xac\x82yby images by Beebe\net al. (1980), Ingersoll et al. (1981) and Mitchell (1982). Eddy\nzonal and meridional wind speeds were 10\xe2\x80\x9320 m s\xe2\x88\x921 and 5\xe2\x80\x93\n10 m s\xe2\x88\x921 in the zonal and meridional directions, respectively.\nThe zonal mean covariance u v , indicative of the horizontal\nmomentum transport, was found to be positively correlated with\nthe latitudinal shear of the mean zonal wind d u /dy, indicating\nthat eddies transport momentum into the eastward jets and out\nof the westward jets. Sromovsky et al. (1982) raised questions\nabout this result because of human target selection bias and the\npresence of outlier wind vectors that may have contributed disproportionately to the covariance. Salyk et al. (2006) made use\nof images from the Cassini \xef\xac\x82yby of Jupiter and an automated\ncloud tracking program to revisit these questions. The automated technique dramatically increases the number of vectors\nand provides a less biased sample. Several tests were run to\nremove potential sources of bias, and concluded that none of\nthese signi\xef\xac\x81cantly affect the result, lending con\xef\xac\x81dence to the\nconclusion that eddies supply momentum to Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s jets. For\nan assumed 2.5 bar depth of the weather layer (see Fig. 4.2),\nSalyk et al. (2006) found that the rate of conversion of eddy\nto zonal mean kinetic energy was 0.7\xe2\x80\x931.2 W m\xe2\x88\x922 , about 5% as\nlarge as Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s thermal energy \xef\xac\x82ux to space. By comparison,\nthe eddy\xe2\x80\x93zonal energy conversion rate on Earth is only about\n0.1% of its emitted thermal \xef\xac\x82ux (Ingersoll et al., 1981).\nSaturn has been a more dif\xef\xac\x81cult target for observations of\ntropospheric dynamics because of its thick upper tropospheric\nhaze (Karkoschka and Tomasko, 2005; P\xc3\xa9rez-Hoyos et al.,\n2005), which limits feature contrasts at deeper levels and thus\nresults in fewer reliable targets to track than for Jupiter. Several unsuccessful attempts to derive eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82uxes\nwith a small sample of manually tracked wind vectors in visible\nwavelength images were made with the Voyager Saturn dataset\n(Ingersoll et al., 1984; Sromovsky et al., 1986). However, the\nCassini ISS instrument (Porco et al., 2004) carried near-infrared\ncontinuum \xef\xac\x81lters that permitted better partial seeing through\nthe Saturn haze to the ammonia cloud-top level (Section 4.4.1).\nThese \xef\xac\x81lters reduce the contribution of Rayleigh scattering and\nthus improve the contrast of features at higher levels. Using an\nautomated tracking technique, this allowed an order of magnitude more wind vectors, with relatively unbiased sampling,\nto be obtained for Saturn than had been the case for Voyager.\nCassini Saturn data in the 750 nm continuum band showed that\nu v was positively correlated with d u /dy, just as for Jupiter,\nbut with about half the energy conversion rate estimated for\nJupiter (Del Genio et al., 2007; Del Genio and Barbara, 2012);\nsee Fig. 4.18.\nDel Genio and Barbara (2012) found that the u v source\nfor jet momentum and the corresponding energy convergence\nrate are larger for the eastward jets than the westward jets. Furthermore, by tracking features in 727 nm methane absorption\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 86 \xe2\x80\x94 #108\n\n86\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\nmeridional circulation is thermodynamically indirect, with rising poleward of the eastward jets, sinking equatorward of the\njets, and an equatorward mean meridional \xef\xac\x82ow v in the upper\nbranch of the mean circulation. The Coriolis force on this\nmeridional \xef\xac\x82ow may then be the momentum sink that balances\nthe eddy source, i.e., to \xef\xac\x81rst order, \xe2\x88\x92 f v = \xe2\x88\x92d u v /dy, where\nf is the Coriolis parameter. The meridional wind required to\nmaintain this balance (\xe2\x88\xbc0.02 m s\xe2\x88\x921 ) is much smaller than that\ndetectable in cloud-tracked winds (Del Genio et al., 2007).\n\n4.9 JUPITER AND SATURN: TEMPORAL\nVARIABILITY OF WINDS\n\nFigure 4.18 Composite latitudinal pro\xef\xac\x81les of mean zonal wind and\neddy momentum \xef\xac\x82ux for three eastward jets and four westward jets on\nSaturn (Del Genio and Barbara, 2012). The solid curves are from\ncontinuum \xef\xac\x81lter images that sense the mid-tropospheric ammonia\ncloud level, and the dotted curves are from methane absorption band\nimages that sense the upper troposphere.\n\nband images, which sense features several hundred millibars\nhigher up in the upper troposphere haze, they demonstrated that\nthe eastward jets weaken and broaden upward, accompanied by\na weakening of u v , as expected for eddy-driven jets (e.g.,\nDritschel and McIntyre, 2008). No similar vertical variation is\nseen in the westward jets. This is consistent with the staircase\nlatitudinal pro\xef\xac\x81le of potential vorticity derived by Read et al.\n(2009), with the \xe2\x80\x9csteps\xe2\x80\x9d at the eastward jet cores where air\nmixed from opposite sides of the jets meets. The decrease in\nu v upward on Saturn suggests eddies that are driven at or\nbelow the continuum cloud level, perhaps by a process such\nas baroclinic instability, as suggested by Godfrey and Moore\n(1986). However, models simulating such instabilities are not\nyet able to reproduce propagation characteristics of observed\nwave-like features such as the ribbon wave (Sayanagi et al.,\n2010b) \xe2\x80\x93 Fig. 4.8 \xe2\x80\x93 and the relative roles of baroclinic and barotropic conversion have yet to be determined. The magnitude of\nthe implied energy conversion rate severely limits the depths\nof the eddies, seemingly ruling out a deep convective cylinder source for at least the extratropical jets (Liu and Schneider,\n2010). The upward decrease in u v also seems to rule out\nradiative driving for Saturn, where solar heating is concentrated\nin the upper tropospheric haze (P\xc3\xa9rez-Hoyos and S\xc3\xa1nchezLavega, 2006b). Driving by differential insolation as suggested\nby Liu and Schneider (2010) may be more tenable for Jupiter,\nwhere there is no thick haze and sunlight penetrates deeper.\nIn the absence of radiative driving, the most likely energy\nsource for the eddies maintaining the jets may be lateral temperature contrasts due to the latent heat released by water condensation (Lian and Showman, 2010), although many aspects\nof this idea remain to be fully explored. On Jupiter, and to at\nleast some extent on Saturn, deep convective clouds are most\ncommon in the cyclonic shear zones (Ingersoll et al., 2000;\nPorco et al., 2003; Del Genio et al., 2007), implying that these\nare regions of moisture convergence near the deep water condensation level, positive deep temperature anomalies and net\nlarge-scale rising motion above. This then implies that the mean\n\nOverall, the zonal jet systems of Jupiter and Saturn have been\nstable since the beginning of detailed spacecraft observations.\nSome changes have been detected in the intensity of a few jets\nin Jupiter and Saturn, but not in their latitudinal location. A\nlarge part of the detected variations may be due to vertical wind\nshear and variations in the pressure level of the clouds used as\nwind tracers.\nIn the case of Jupiter, Simon-Miller et al. (2000) performed\na systematic search of Voyager, HST and Cassini wind data\nfor periodicities in the jet wind velocities, but found only a\nfew latitudes with potential variability near the equator at 0\xe2\x97\xa6 at\n10\xe2\x80\x9312\xe2\x97\xa6 N and at 14\xe2\x80\x9328\xe2\x97\xa6 S planetographic latitudes, but inad-\n\nFigure 4.19 Upper panel: Changes in the 24\xe2\x97\xa6 N Jovian jet between\n1979 and 1997.

More robust changes (without a clear asssociated\nperiodicity) have been detected in the the 24\xe2\x97\xa6 N eastward jet\nand in the North Equatorial Belt at 7\xe2\x97\xa6 N. In the \xef\xac\x81rst case,\nintensity \xef\xac\x82uctuations go from 180 m s\xe2\x88\x921 at the time of the Voyagers (Maxworthy, 1984) to 120 m s\xe2\x88\x921 in modern times (Simon,\n1999; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2000); Fig. 4.19. These changes\nof the jet peak speed are associated with morphology changes\nand large-scale convective disturbances that cause considerable turbulence and might develop hydrodynamic instabilities\n(Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2000; Barrado-Izagirre et al., 2009;\nTollefson et al., 2017). However, the general structure of the jet\ndid not change during these large-scale disturbances (S\xc3\xa1nchezLavega et al., 2008a). Changes in the North Equatorial Belt\nin the north part of the equatorial jet have also been reported\nseveral times (Asay-Davis et al., 2011; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al.,\n2011a; Barrado-Izagirre et al., 2013). These changes are possibly not real but caused by the superposition of the true zonal\nwind with the motions of large-scale dark equatorial projections interpreted as the manifestation of an equatorially trapped\nRossby wave moving with a certain phase speed (Allison, 1990;\nArregi et al., 2006; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2011a; Ortiz et al.,\n1998; Showman and Dowling, 2000).\nFor Saturn, the most conspicuous change is found in the\nequatorial jet. During the Voyager encounters in 1980\xe2\x80\x9381 the\njet reached peak velocities of \xe2\x88\xbc480 m s\xe2\x88\x921 in green-\xef\xac\x81ltered\nimages (Ingersoll et al., 1984; S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2000).\nWhen the zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le was measured in high-resolution\nHST images in the 890 nm methane-band \xef\xac\x81lter (1994\xe2\x80\x932000),\nmaximum velocities were 200 m s\xe2\x88\x921 slower (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega\net al., 2003). Analysis of Cassini ISS observations in the 890 nm\nmethane band and the adjacent continuum were able to sense\npressure levels of 60 mbar and 300 mbar respectively, detecting\na vertical wind shear of 100 m s\xe2\x88\x921 between both levels and\npartially explaining the difference (Porco et al., 2005; Vasavada\net al., 2006; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2011b). However, the wind\nspeed at 300 mbar was 100 m s\xe2\x88\x921 slower than Voyager measurements. Voyager images sounded the \xe2\x88\xbc300\xe2\x80\x93400 mbar levels\n(P\xc3\xa9rez-Hoyos and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega, 2006b), but some cloud\nfeatures used as tracers in Voyager images might be rooted at\ndeeper levels. In fact, thermal infrared measurements with the\nCassini VIMS instrument suggest that winds may increase by\n100 m s\xe2\x88\x921 below the 2 bar level (Choi et al., 2009). The 1990\nGreat White Spot (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 1991) might have\naffected the equatorial jet at the visible ammonia cloud level\n(S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2003; Sayanagi and Showman, 2007).\nIt has recently been shown that strong vertical shear and temporal variability occurs at Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s equator (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega\net al., 2016).\n\n4.10 WINDS OF URANUS AND NEPTUNE\nThe atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune have comparatively\nsimple circulations, both highly zonal and each characterized by\na broad retrograde equatorial jet and high-latitude prograde jets.\nThe circulations are surprisingly similar considering their very\ndifferent spin-axis inclinations and internal heat sources, and\ntheir winds surprisingly strong considering their weak absorbed\n\xef\xac\x82ux of sunlight. Their circulations have been measured mainly\n\n87\n\nby tracking discrete cloud features, with some additional constraints provided by radio and stellar occultations. Discrete\ncloud features provide the most detailed information about\natmospheric motions, but complicate our understanding by\nnot always following the local mass \xef\xac\x82ow. Examples of such\nbehavior in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere are the orographic clouds in\nstationary waves formed by air \xef\xac\x82owing over mountain ranges\n(and through the clouds). A similar kind of cloud is thought\nto accompany large features on Uranus and Neptune, the most\nprominent of which is the Great Dark Spot (GDS) on Neptune, which had many \xe2\x80\x9ccompanion\xe2\x80\x9d clouds that moved at the\nsame rate as the GDS, even though they were displaced by\na signi\xef\xac\x81cant distance in latitude. There is also a segregation\nof features by lifetime. Some features, especially on Neptune,\ndo not even last for a complete revolution of the planet, while\nothers, especially on Uranus, seem to last for decades. Another\nstrange characteristic of these planets is that there is a great deal\nof small-scale latitudinal banding that seems to have no connection to any feature of the measured circulation. This is quite\nunlike Jupiter, for which cloud bands and zonal wind changes\nare strongly correlated. Although little is known about the weak\nmean meridional motions or eddy motions, the motions of discrete features are often not purely zonal. Oscillations in latitude\nand longitude of many features have been observed on both\nplanets, some of which appear to be due to inertial oscillations,\nsome possibly Rossby waves, and some appear to be related to\nmeandering jet \xef\xac\x82ow along streamlines stationary with respect\nto the interior.\nVoyager visited Uranus in 1986, initially detecting only eight\ndiscrete cloud targets. It visited Neptune in 1989, \xef\xac\x81nding an\nabundance of discrete cloud targets, large vortices and interesting dynamical phenomena. The clouds of Uranus were of very\nlow contrast at the wavelengths available to the Voyager camera\nsystem, and details of its circulation had to be \xef\xac\x81lled in many\nyears later using primarily near-IR adaptive optics (AO) imaging by the Keck II telescope. HST imaging has also contributed\nto our knowledge of both circulations since 1994. A very\nrecent reanalysis of Voyager imagery by Karkoschka (2015)\nuncovered many very low-contrast features that provided new\ndetails of the 1986 southern hemisphere circulation of Uranus\nthat could not be characterized by ground-based observations.\nThe circulation of Uranus appears to have a small, but persistent, mid-latitude hemispheric asymmetry, but a rather large\nhigh-latitude asymmetry. Polar motions are only known in the\nsouth polar regions of Neptune, because the north has remained\nhidden from view.\nIn the following, we \xef\xac\x81rst discuss measurements of the circulation of Uranus, followed by a similar discussion of measurements of Neptune. In each case we summarize the published\nobservations, and discuss their relationship to each other. This\nis followed by a discussion of the vertical extent of the zonal jets\non both planets, based on analysis of their gravitational \xef\xac\x81elds.\n\n4.11 ZONAL JETS OF URANUS\n4.11.1 Uranus Wind Datasets\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst wind observations of Uranus (Smith et al., 1986)\nwere based mainly on tracking features observed in Voyager 2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 88 \xe2\x80\x94 #110\n\n88\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nimages of Uranus acquired during the 1986 \xef\xac\x82yby. All of these\nwere measured in the southern hemisphere, which was pointed\ntowards the Earth at the time of the \xef\xac\x82yby. The only point in the\ndark (at that time) northern hemisphere was obtained by radio\noccultation (Lindal et al., 1987). The single point obtained in\nthe south polar region was from a very subtle feature in UV\nimages, and the motion of that feature was inferred from the\nrotational displacements in a sequence of images required to\nmaximize the contrast of that feature in the average of the displaced images. The remaining targets were seen best at longer\nvisible wavelengths, and all were of low contrast. These and\nall subsequent winds were de\xef\xac\x81ned relative to a frame rotating\nwith the adopted 17.24 hr period of Uranus (Seidelmann et al.,\n2002), which is based on radio measurements with an uncertainty of \xc2\xb10.01 hr (Warwick et al., 1986).\nThe next big improvement in Uranus wind measurements\n(Karkoschka, 1998) was obtained from near-IR images obtained\nby the HST NICMOS instrument, which showed a number\nof cloud features that had high contrast at 1.6 \xce\xbcm. Some of\nthese were visible in the northern hemisphere, as Uranus moved\ntoward its 2007 equinox. Further additions were made by an\nanalysis of HST observations through 2000 (Hammel et al.,\n2001), a remeasurement of 2003 Keck results (Hammel et al.,\n2005; Sromovsky et al., 2009), Keck results from 2003 and\n2004 (Sromovsky and Fry, 2005), 2005 Keck results (Sromovsky et al., 2007) and 2006 Keck results (Hammel et al.,\n2009).\nA signi\xef\xac\x81cant addition was made by Sromovsky et al. (2009)\nfrom analysis of intensive observations carried out near the\n\nFigure 4.20 High signal-to-noise 2012 Keck II NIRC2 near-IR\nH-band (1.62 \xce\xbcm) image from July 25, 2012. Over 100 images were\naveraged and high-pass \xef\xac\x81ltered after individual images were processed\nto remove planetary rotation and wind displacement between images\n(Fry et al., 2012b). The north pole is at about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The\nscallops seen left of center are just south of the equator. For further\nexamples from the 2012\xe2\x80\x932014 period see Sromovsky et al. (2015).\n\ntime of the 2007 equinox of Uranus, when clouds in the north\npolar regions of Uranus became visible at wavelengths where\nno clouds had ever been seen in the southern hemisphere.\nThe 2007 observations were \xef\xac\x81nally able to detect cloud features up to 70\xe2\x97\xa6 N, and obtained precise wind measurements\nup to 62\xe2\x97\xa6 N (planetocentric) latitude, for the \xef\xac\x81rst time showing the beginnings of a northern prograde jet peak with a\nspeed near 250 m s\xe2\x88\x921 . Taking advantage of better views of the\nnorthern hemisphere and special high signal-to-noise observing techniques (Fig. 4.20), further additions to the Uranus\nwind database were made by Fry et al. (2012a), based on\nHST WFC3 observations, and by Sromovsky et al. (2012a,b,\n2015), based on Keck and Gemini observations at near-IR\nwavelengths. This resulted in a much better characterization of the north polar jet and identi\xef\xac\x81ed a region from the\njet peak towards the pole that was in precise solid-body\nrotation.\nA very signi\xef\xac\x81cant recent addition to the Uranus winds\ndatabase was made by Karkoschka (2015), who reprocessed\n1986 Voyager 2 images of Uranus to remove artifacts and\nimprove nonlinearity corrections, making it possible to average large numbers of images to greatly improve signal-to-noise\nratios. This enabled detection and tracking of very low-contrast\ncloud features in the southern hemisphere of Uranus, \xef\xac\x81lling in\nlarge gaps in latitude coverage.\n\n4.11.2 Uranus Zonal Wind Pro\xef\xac\x81les\nTo provide a smooth pro\xef\xac\x81le, Sromovsky et al. (2012b) carried out Legendre polynomial \xef\xac\x81ts to combinations of observations from 2009 and 2011, and also \xef\xac\x81tted a more extensive\nset of observations that included the highest-accuracy observations from 2007. They \xef\xac\x81tted the angular (longitudinal) drift\nrates rather than wind speeds because the observations are most\nconsistent with a constant angular drift rate at high latitudes.\nThey also added the 1986 Voyager measurement at 71\xe2\x97\xa6 S (Smith\net al., 1986) and arti\xef\xac\x81cial measurements of 4.3\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 westward\nat both poles to better constrain high latitudes. The angular rate\n4.3\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 was chosen to match the nearest observed point. The\nVoyager point was not needed for \xef\xac\x81ts that were constrained to\nbe symmetric. Because both of these \xef\xac\x81ts are more symmetric than the \xef\xac\x81t obtained to the 2007 data alone, the possibility that the circulation of Uranus is actually close to symmetric\nmotivated them to carry out \xef\xac\x81ts in which only the even Legendre polynomials were used, insuring \xef\xac\x81ts that were symmetric\nabout the equator. More recent zonal pro\xef\xac\x81le \xef\xac\x81ts to 2012\xe2\x80\x932014\nKeck and Gemini observations were provided by Sromovsky\net al. (2015). These latter observations were consistent with\na precise solid-body rotation rate of 4.1\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 westward from\n62\xe2\x97\xa6 N to at least 83\xe2\x97\xa6 N. Sromovsky et al. (2015) noted a discrepancy between near-equatorial motions of wave features and\nsmall discrete features, which moved eastward at 0.4\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 and\n0.1\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 respectively. Sromovsky et al. (2015) provided three\nsymmetric \xef\xac\x81ts: one which combined all the new observations,\none which excluded near-equatorial wave motions, and one\nwhich excluded near-equatorial discrete features and kept the\nwave motions. They also provided separate \xef\xac\x81ts to asymmetry\ncharacteristics.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 89 \xe2\x80\x94 #111\n\nGas Giants\nAll these Legendre expansions were of the form\nn\n\nCi \xc3\x97 Pi (sin(\xcf\x86g )),\n\nd\xce\xbb/dt =\n\n(4.8)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere Pi (sin(\xcf\x86g )) is the ith Legendre polynomial evaluated at\nthe sine of the planetographic latitude \xcf\x86g , d\xce\xbb/dt is the longitudinal drift rate in \xe2\x97\xa6 W hr\xe2\x88\x921 and the Ci are the coef\xef\xac\x81cients tabulated\nfor \xef\xac\x81ts given by Sromovsky et al. (2009, 2012b, 2015). The drift\nrates are converted to wind speed using Eqs. (2.4) and (2.11),\nsubstituting the equatorial and polar radii of Uranus given by\nArchinal et al. (2011) as 25 559 km and 24 973 km, respectively.\nFor the symmetric \xef\xac\x81ts, the summation over i is only over the\neven polynomials. The model coef\xef\xac\x81cients were found by minimizing \xcf\x872 , but with error estimates for the observations modi\xef\xac\x81ed as described in the following paragraph.\nVery accurate measurements of drift rates at nearly the same\nlatitude often did not agree within their uncertainties, and often\ndiffered by many times the value expected from those uncertainties. Sromovsky et al. (2012b) offered several possible reasons:\n(1) the circulation is not entirely steady; (2) the measured features do not all represent the same atmospheric level; or (3) the\ntracked cloud features are not always at the same latitude as the\ncirculation feature that is moving with the zonal \xef\xac\x82ow. Examples\nof the latter possibility are the companion clouds to Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s\nGreat Dark Spot, which traveled with the spot even though\nseparated by nearly 10\xe2\x97\xa6 in latitude (Sromovsky et al., 1993).\nLess extreme examples have also been seen on Uranus (Hammel et al., 2009; de Pater et al., 2011). If highly accurate measurements are included, and weighted by their estimated accuracy, they can dominate the \xef\xac\x81t, leading to unreasonable variations in regions where there are less accurate measurements.\nSince these high-accuracy measurements clearly do not all follow the mean \xef\xac\x82ow, Sromovsky et al. (2012b) added an additional uncertainty to characterize their deviations from the mean\n\nFigure 4.21 Adopted zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le (solid curve) from\nSromovsky et al.

The\nsize of the representation error was adjusted to make the \xcf\x872\nvalue of the complete asymmetric \xef\xac\x81t approximately equal to\nthe number of degrees of freedom (number of measurements\nminus the number of \xef\xac\x81tted parameters). This representative\nerror was approximately 0.1\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 for both the 2009\xe2\x80\x932011 and\n2007\xe2\x80\x932011 datasets. Sromovsky et al. (2015) obtained values\nbetween 0.125\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 and 0.147\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 , depending on which nearequatorial datasets were included.\nThe current best estimate for the zonal wind pro\xef\xac\x81le of\nUranus is the composite pro\xef\xac\x81le shown in Fig. 4.21 from Sromovsky et al. (2015). The pro\xef\xac\x81le was constructed starting with\na symmetric ten-term Legendre \xef\xac\x81t (up to 18th order) to their\n2012\xe2\x80\x932014 dataset, consisting of over 850 wind measurements\nsampling latitudes from 47\xe2\x97\xa6 S to 85\xe2\x97\xa6 N. To this they added a\nmid-latitude asymmetry function \xef\xac\x81tted to a dataset including\nobservations back to 1997. For latitudes south of 47\xe2\x97\xa6 S they\nadopted the same pro\xef\xac\x81le adopted by Karkoschka (2015), which\nis based on his reanalysis of 1986 Voyager images. This combination, shown as the solid curve in Fig. 4.21, is available in\ntabular form at 1\xe2\x97\xa6 intervals (Sromovsky et al., 2015). The dotted curve is the re\xef\xac\x82ection of the solid curve about the equator,\nrevealing small mid-latitude and large high-latitude asymmetries between hemispheres. The open circles in the \xef\xac\x81gure are the\nresults of averaging the 2012\xe2\x80\x932014 results in 2\xe2\x97\xa6 latitude bins.\nThe dispersion of the binned results near the equator is a result\nof differences between the motions of waves and the motions of\nsmall discrete features.\n4.11.3 Symmetry Properties\nSromovsky et al. (2012b) provided individual \xef\xac\x81ts to the 2009\nand 2011 datasets combined, and for the 2007, 2009 and 2011\ndatasets combined. They showed that these datasets alone cannot distinguish between symmetric and asymmetric models.\nThey also combined the data from 1997 through 2005 (see\nSromovsky et al., 2009, and references therein), selecting only\nthose with wind errors < 10 m s\xe2\x88\x921 and latitude errors \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5\xe2\x97\xa6 ,\nand then combined these with the high-accuracy winds from\n2007\xe2\x80\x932011, which yielded a total of 125 observations (127,\nincluding synthetic polar points). A comparison of the asymmetry properties of the 2007\xe2\x80\x932011 observations and those of\nthe earlier observations shows that the new \xef\xac\x81ts are more symmetric than prior \xef\xac\x81ts. Although the new observations make the\nentire dataset somewhat more symmetric, the remaining asymmetry is better de\xef\xac\x81ned. The 2012\xe2\x80\x932014 symmetry results of\nSromovsky et al. (2015), shown in Fig. 4.22, don\xe2\x80\x99t change this\npicture very much. It is not clear whether the true asymmetry of\nthe zonal winds has changed slightly or whether the new observations are just sampling a different statistical variation in target\nmotions. The better de\xef\xac\x81nition of asymmetry obtained from the\nlarger combined dataset depends on the earlier observations,\nwhich are better distributed in latitude and contribute more\nmeasurements in the southern hemisphere. The Berg feature is\nresponsible for many of those observations; as it traveled from\n33\xe2\x80\x9334\xe2\x97\xa6 S to 8\xe2\x97\xa6 S (Sromovsky et al., 2009; de Pater et al., 2011) it\nprovided samples of drift rates within that range, though unfortunately sampled too sparsely to provide a detailed pro\xef\xac\x81le. It\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 90 \xe2\x80\x94 #112\n\n90\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\n50\n\n40\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\nPlanetographic latitude, o\n\n60\n\n50\n\nPlanetographic latitude,\n\n70\n\n60\n\nlarge gradients in drift rate (Karkoschka, 2015).

If this\nis a seasonal effect, then this combination is not an appropriate rendition of the current state of the Uranus circulation, and\nbig changes in circulation might be observed between now and\n2030, when the northern hemisphere will reach its next summer\nsolstice and might be expected to attain at that time the circulation pro\xef\xac\x81le indicated by the dotted curve (a re\xef\xac\x82ection of what\nwas seen at the southern hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s summer solstice).\n\n90\n80\n\n70\n\no\n\n90\n80\n\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n-20\n-30\n-40\n\n-50\n\n-50\n\n-60\n\n-60\n\n-70\n-80\n-90\n\nA\n-0.4 -0.2 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\no\nDrift rate difference from even fit, /h\n\n-70\n-80\n-90\n\n4.11.4 Long-Lived Feature Tracking\nB\n\n-0.4 -0.2 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\no\nDrift rate difference from even fit, /h\n\nFigure 4.22 (A): Wind differences from a symmetric model \xef\xac\x81tted to\nhigh-quality wind observations from 1997\xe2\x80\x932014. (B) Differences that\nexclude observations from 2012\xe2\x80\x932014. Adapted from Sromovsky\net al. (2015).\n\nis clear that because high-accuracy winds do not always represent the mean zonal \xef\xac\x82ow with similar accuracy, the asymmetry\ninformation in a sparsely sampled dataset can easily be misleading. With the large numbers of samples obtained by combining\nall observations from 1997 onward, this is less of a concern.\nCombining observations between 1997 and 2005 with those\nup to 2011 provides an approximate representation of the circulation pattern near the 2007 equinox (the mean year of these\nobservations is \xe2\x88\xbc2006). If the asymmetry is actually a longdelayed seasonal effect (with a phase shift near 90\xe2\x97\xa6 ), then it\nshould be re\xef\xac\x82ected about the equator at the prior equinox, and\nnear the midpoint of the transition in 1986, when Voyager\nobservations were made. However, Sromovsky et al. (2012b)\nfound that the 1986 Voyager measurements were not measurably different from their grand-average pro\xef\xac\x81le, nor from the\n2007 equinox results alone (Sromovsky et al., 2009). This further enhances the probability that the mid-latitude asymmetry\nmay be a relatively stable feature over a long period, perhaps\nmore than a Uranian year. While this seems to violate our\nexpectations of symmetry in the annual average (over the Uranian year), there are other examples of persistent asymmetry in\nzonal circulation pro\xef\xac\x81les, namely those of Jupiter and Saturn.\nSromovsky et al. (2012b) also suggested alternative interpretations for the lack of change in asymmetry of the wind pro\xef\xac\x81le.\nFor example, if the phase shift were closer to 45\xe2\x97\xa6 and had a\nsinusoidal variation, then the asymmetry might be the same at\nboth equinox and solstice, with maxima in between. Another\npossibility is that the symmetry variation does not proceed in a\nuniform or sinusoidal fashion, but achieves most of the change\nby the solstice, and changes little between solstice and the next\nequinox. Further observations over many years will be required\nto distinguish these possibilities.\nThe mid-latitude asymmetry pales in comparison to the dramatic high-latitude asymmetry revealed by the most recent wind\nresults (Fig. 4.21). While the northern hemisphere has a broad\nregion (from 62\xe2\x97\xa6 N to at least 83\xe2\x97\xa6 ) of solid-body rotation (Sromovsky et al., 2015), the southern hemisphere has a much\nsmaller region of solid-body rotation and much larger region of\n\nSome cloud features on Uranus have extremely long lifetimes\nthat permit studying motions on longer timescales. Karkoschka\n(1998) noted that over the 100-day period covered by his 1997\nand 1998 NICMOS observations, all eight of the features he\ndetected were visible whenever they were on the sunlit side of\nUranus. A bright high-altitude cloud feature seen near 30\xe2\x97\xa6 N\n(Sromovsky et al., 2007) was tracked for more than a year. The\nlarge \xe2\x80\x9cBerg\xe2\x80\x9d feature was observed to oscillate between 32\xe2\x97\xa6 S\nand 36\xe2\x97\xa6 S for many years, which it may have been doing since\n1986, then observed to drift northward beginning in 2005 (Sromovsky and Fry, 2005; Sromovsky et al., 2009; de Pater et al.,\n2011), \xef\xac\x81nally dissipating as it approached the equator near the\nend of 2009. Additionally, Sromovsky et al. (2009) were able to\ntrack eight features for well over a month (1055\xe2\x80\x932250 hr) during the intensive equinox observing period. Another long-lived\nbright feature near 30\xe2\x97\xa6 N was tracked from July 26, 2011 until\nDecember 16, 2011 (Sromovsky et al., 2012a). More recently,\nSromovsky et al. (2015) identi\xef\xac\x81ed six long-lived discrete features that were tracked over time intervals of \xef\xac\x81ve months, more\nthan a year, and more than three years. Most features move as if\ncarried by the zonal mean \xef\xac\x82ow. However, bright clouds associated with dark features appear to move as companions to dark\nfeatures, following the zonal \xef\xac\x82ow at the latitude of the dark feature. Several of these features exhibited equatorward drifts and\nsome oscillated in latitude and drift rate.\n\n4.11.5 Altitudes of Uranian Cloud Features\nThe most extensive set of effective cloud pressures were\nobtained from post-equinox observations in July and October\nof 2011 by Sromovsky et al. (2012b) using the spatial modulation technique. Most of the tracked cloud features were near\nthe 1.2 bar methane condensation level or deeper. Several features in the northern hemisphere were found to be well above\nthe methane condensation level, one reaching close to 400 mbar.\nAccording to Sromovsky et al. (2007), the brightest feature ever\nseen on Uranus reached estimated pressures near 300 mbar for\nits highest component, with other parts found between 400 mbar\nand 600 mbar. Another unusually bright feature, though much\ndimmer than the brightest feature, had estimated effective pressures ranging from 390 mbar to 690 mbar (Sromovsky et al.,\n2012a). During the same period a second bright spot was found\nat nearly the same latitude, but had a signi\xef\xac\x81cantly higher effective pressure of 1\xe2\x80\x931.3 bar. The clouds comprising the Berg were\ninvestigated by de Pater et al. (2011). They found that the\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 91 \xe2\x80\x94 #113\n\nGas Giants\n70\n60\n\n70\n\nA\n\n60\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n4.12.1 Neptune Wind Datasets\nThe discovery of multiple periods in Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s light curve (Belton et al., 1981) strongly suggested that Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s winds varied with latitude. The \xef\xac\x81rst wind measurement based on discrete\ncloud tracking was made using ground-based methane-band\nimages by Hammel and Buie (1987), although only one feature was visible in the low-resolution images that were obtained.\nVoyager 2 images acquired during its 1989 encounter with the\nplanet provided the \xef\xac\x81rst detailed views of its fascinating cloud\nfeatures. Neptune proved to be much more active than Uranus,\ngenerating many bright cloud features that were of decent contrast even over the limited wavelength range of the Voyager\ncameras. The \xef\xac\x81rst results, published by Smith et al. (1989),\nestablished the existence of the retrograde equatorial motions as\nwell as a mid-latitude jet, but were somewhat misleading in two\nrespects: (1) the largest wind speeds were obtained from unreliable cloud targets with large uncertainties, and (2) the motions\nof clouds in the region of the south polar feature were assigned\nthe group velocity rather than the velocity of individual cloud\nfeatures, which were not resolved in the early measurements.\nThe follow-up paper by Hammel et al. (1989) \xef\xac\x81xed the \xef\xac\x81rst\nproblem, but the second was not \xef\xac\x81xed until the more detailed\nanalysis of high-resolution Voyager images by Limaye and Sromovsky (1991), which showed that the South Polar Features\nappeared nearly stationary at low resolution, but at high spatial resolution individual cloud elements were seen to form at\none edge of the region of formation, move rapidly through that\nregion, and dissipate as they exited the region. These clouds\nwere also clouds that cast shadows, suggestive of strong vertical\nconvection. This work provided what remains the most detailed\nwind dataset.\nThe Voyager wind results for Neptune are plotted as zonal\ndrift rate in \xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 vs planetographic latitude in Fig. 4.24A,\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\x9210\n\n\xe2\x88\x9210\n\n\xe2\x88\x9220\n\n\xe2\x88\x9220\n\n\xe2\x88\x9230\n\n\xe2\x88\x9230\n\n\xe2\x88\x9240\n\n\xe2\x88\x9240\n\xe2\x88\x9250\n\n\xe2\x88\x9260\n\n4.12 ZONAL JETS OF NEPTUNE\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x88\x9250\n\nbrightest parts of the feature, which is the only part of the feature that could be seen in K images, had effective pressures in\nthe 550\xe2\x80\x93750 mbar range, while the main part of the feature was\nmuch deeper, ranging from 1.7\xe2\x80\x933.5 bar.\n\nB\n\n50\n\n40\n\nPlanetographic Latitude, o\n\n50\n\nFigure 4.23 Voyager 2 images from 1989 of Neptune (north up) with\nclear and orange \xef\xac\x81lters, illustrating major cloud features, of which\nonly the SPF seems to still be present.

These are consistent with the current IAU working group recommendations (Archinal et al., 2011).

One interpretation, that these are wave features generated by (and moving with) circulation features at deeper levels\nof the atmosphere, contradicts the inference from Voyager IRIS\nobservations that the zonal winds decline with altitude rather\nthan increase, although IRIS senses much higher altitudes than\nreached by either the small or large cloud features that were\ntracked.\nAn especially interesting result obtained by Sromovsky et al.\n(1993) is that the region of South Polar Feature (SPF) formation\nand the central longitude of the DS2 oscillation, though separated by 20\xe2\x97\xa6 of latitude, remain at opposite sides of the planet in\nphase-locked synchronous rotation. Because of the long period\nof observation, this complex had a very well-de\xef\xac\x81ned rotation\nrate of 15.9699\xc2\xb10.0002 hr, based mainly on the more accurate DS2 observations. This is 200 times more accurate than\nthe initial determination of the radio period of 16.11\xc2\xb10.05 hr\n(Warwick et al., 1989). It seemed unlikely that these two structures could be phase-locked unless they were both connected\nto the interior, leading Sromovsky and Limaye (1992) to suggest that their joint rotation might be a better rotation period of\nthe interior than the radio period itself. However, the difference\nbetween the two periods was several times the uncertainty in\nthe radio period of Warwick et al. (1989) and nearly 23 times\nthe uncertainty in the revised period of Lecacheux et al. (1993).\nIt was not until Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s radio period appeared to vary (Gurnett\net al., 2005) that this idea was given new life by Karkoschka\n(2011), which will be discussed later.\nEarly observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in late\n1991, before the spherical aberration was corrected, produced\nthe \xef\xac\x81rst post-Voyager additions to the circulation of Neptune.\nSromovsky et al. (1995) were able to identify and track eight\ndiscrete cloud features, most of which were quite consistent\nwith the Voyager wind pro\xef\xac\x81le. After the spherical aberration\nwas \xef\xac\x81xed, HST observations became more proli\xef\xac\x81c. Hammel\nand Lockwood (1997) analyzed HST images obtained in 1994,\n1995 and 1996, \xef\xac\x81nding dark spots in 1994 and 1995, and bright\nspots at latitudes where none had previously been seen, which\nmade it possible to \xef\xac\x81ll in some gaps in the Voyager pro\xef\xac\x81le. From\n1995 HST data they obtained wind speeds from six long-lived\nfeatures, three of which were at new latitudes. Sromovsky et al.\n(2001a) analyzed HST observations from 1996, adding 18 new\nwind measurements, also \xef\xac\x81nding generally close agreement\nwith the Voyager wind pro\xef\xac\x81le, except for features associated\nwith a northern great dark spot. They also obtained winds from\narchived HST observations from June (9 vectors) and November of 1994 (14 vectors) and September 1995 (8 vectors). About\nhalf of the November vectors deviated by large amounts from\nthe Voyager pro\xef\xac\x81le, moving as companions to what is thought\nto be an unseen vortex, perhaps formerly associated with a dark\nspot. The south polar dark band, with a wavenumber-1 latitudinal variation, was seen in these Hubble images, as it was in\nVoyager images.\nAn additional 19 wind measurements were obtained by Sromovsky et al. (2001b) from 1998 HST images. These were\nmostly consistent with the Voyager wind pro\xef\xac\x81le, again with\nexceptions related to bright companion clouds. They also combined 1995, 1996 and 1998 observations to determine new\nzonal and vorticity pro\xef\xac\x81les, obtained by \xef\xac\x81tting densely sam-\n\npled latitudinal regions with special functions. A special effort\nto track dark spots and associated companion clouds by Sromovsky et al. (2002) provided a few very accurate long-term\ndrift rates, and evidence for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal variations, and for companion clouds at latitudes substantially displaced from the associated vortex. Similar efforts have been\nmade recently analyzing multi-year and multi-telescope data\nshowing a new dark spot and associated bright companion\n(Hueso et al., 2017b).\nKeck AO imaging at near-IR wavelengths provided very\ndetailed views of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s cloud features, but only a limited\namount of published wind data has resulted. The most accurate\nresults seem to be those of Fry and Sromovsky (2004), based on\nthree two-night Keck II/NIRC2 imaging runs from August 2003\nand July and August 2004. Images from August 2003 are shown\nin Fig. 4.25 in linear and logarithmic enhancements to show\nboth high- and low-contrast cloud features. Fry and Sromovsky\n(2004) tracked a total of 212 cloud features, 160 with uncertainties less than 80 m s\xe2\x88\x921 and 37 with errors less than 20 m s\xe2\x88\x921 .\nBinning and averaging results in 2.5\xe2\x97\xa6 latitude bins (plotted as\nred points in Fig. 4.24) resulted in remarkably good agreement\nwith the Voyager pro\xef\xac\x81le from 40\xe2\x97\xa6 S to 72\xe2\x97\xa6 S, but considerable\ndispersion away from that pro\xef\xac\x81le was seen at other latitudes,\nwhere it seemed that the Voyager pro\xef\xac\x81le was an upper bound\nto the wind measurements. This might be due to wave interactions that produced features that did not follow the local zonal\n\xef\xac\x82ow. Even more dispersion was found in results of Martin et al.\n(2012), based on 2001 Keck II AO observations with the NIRSPEC imager, but because individual measurements with estimated errors were not published, it is dif\xef\xac\x81cult to incorporate\nthese results into a more comprehensive analysis. They also\nfound what appear to be periodic variations in wind speed that\nwere not seen in any prior cloud tracking work, including the\ndetailed Voyager analysis that is based on data of much higher\nspatial resolution, and thus these variations might well be due to\nsome artifact. A signi\xef\xac\x81cant dispersion of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s zonal winds\nwas also found from an analysis of July 14 and 16, 2009 Keck\nAO images by Fitzpatrick et al. (2014), but was limited to tracking time spans of a few hours or less. This study provided a\nmore detailed error analysis and a generally smaller dispersion\n\nFigure 4.25 Keck II/NIRC2 near-IR color composites using J\n(1.26 \xce\xbcm), H (1.62 \xce\xbcm) and K (2.3 \xce\xbcm) images for R, G and B\ncomponents respectively.

From Karkoschka (2011). In this model,\njets are not purely zonal, but follow a meandering sinusoidal path\naround Neptune.\n\nrelative to Voyager results, especially for winds measured in\nthe K spectral band, which senses higher-altitude features than\nthose measured in the H band. More Keck observations would\ncertainly help to understand these deviations.\nInteresting new results have been derived from a comprehensive analysis due to Karkoschka (2011). He used Voyager\nand Hubble observations of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s South Polar Wave and\nSouth Polar Feature to establish a baseline of \xe2\x88\xbc20 years, arguing\nthat their rotational period over that interval (15.9663\xc2\xb10.0002)\nis the true interior rotation period of Neptune instead of the\nradio period of 16.108\xc2\xb10.006 (Lecacheux et al., 1993). He also\npresented a picture of zonal \xef\xac\x82ow along stationary streamlines\nthat followed wavenumber-1 latitudinal variations, generating\nmeridional wind speeds modeled as v(\xce\xbb, \xcf\x86) = vmax (\xcf\x86) \xc3\x97 sin(\xce\xbb),\nwith vmax (\xcf\x86) peaking at 7 m s\xe2\x88\x921 between 67\xe2\x97\xa6 S and 82\xe2\x97\xa6 S. This\npicture of stationary (in Karkoschka\xe2\x80\x99s System II frame) streamlines, and mass \xef\xac\x82ow that follows them in a wavenumber-1\nmeander of amplitude that varies with latitude, achieves a very\ngood consistency with the oscillations found by Sromovsky\net al. (1993) of the DS2 and \xe2\x80\x9cScooter\xe2\x80\x9d (a bright cloud near\n42\xe2\x97\xa6 S), for which there has been no viable alternative explanation. Karkoschka also found and tracked high-latitude features that \xef\xac\x81lled in missing information at 89\xe2\x97\xa6 S and 86\xe2\x97\xa6 S, and\nan asymmetry that was used to de\xef\xac\x81ne a period for 82\xe2\x97\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9386\xe2\x97\xa6 S.\nThese high-latitude data points seem to rule out the possibility\nof near-polar solid-body rotation at an angular rate of several\n\xe2\x97\xa6 hr\xe2\x88\x921 relative to the interior, as seems to be present on Uranus.\nInformation about the vertical wind shear has been inferred\nmost directly from 1985, 1988 and 1989 stellar occultations of\nNeptune (French et al., 1998), which are in good agreement\nwith each other and with vertical wind shear inferred by Conrath et al. (1989) from horizontal temperature gradients measured by IRIS (and the thermal wind equation).\n4.12.2 Altitudes of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s Clouds\nThe effective pressure at which Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s discrete cloud features occur are generally much lower than those of Uranus,\nwith many cloud features apparent in near-IR K images,\n\n93\n\nwhile Uranus images in that \xef\xac\x81lter rarely show any discrete\nclouds. However, the effective pressures do vary considerably from cloud to cloud. Sromovsky et al. (2001a) found\naltitudes of 60\xc2\xb120 mbar for the brightest northern cloud feature, 230\xc2\xb140 mbar for a large bright feature near 45\xe2\x97\xa6 S, and\n190\xc2\xb140 mbar for a smaller and dimmer feature near 30\xe2\x97\xa6 S. Roe\net al. (2001) obtained 84\xc2\xb126 mbar for a northern cloud and\n140+50 mbar for a southern feature. Gibbard et al. (2003) found\n\xe2\x88\x9230\neffective pressures of 20\xe2\x80\x9345 mbar for features between 30\xe2\x97\xa6 N\nand 45\xe2\x97\xa6 N, and 100\xe2\x80\x93270 mbar for southern features between\n30\xe2\x97\xa6 S and 50\xe2\x97\xa6 S. These are in general agreement that northern cloud features are found at higher altitudes than southern\nfeatures, and also in agreement that all of the discrete clouds\nextend well above the methane condensation level near 1.4 bar,\nbut rarely get above the tropopause level near 100 mbar. These\nclouds are likely formed of methane ice. Two-wavelength color\ncomposite images of Neptune make it clear that clouds of different altitudes are also present at the same latitudes. The level\nto which Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s wind measurements refer are thus somewhat uncertain, but likely average somewhere between 100 and\n200 mbar. The vertical wind shear in this region at low latitudes\ncan reach 30 m s\xe2\x88\x921 per scale height. The scale height in this\nregion is about 22 km, and the altitude difference between 100\nand 200 mbar is about 15 km. Thus, at low latitudes, where wind\nspeeds reach up to 400 m s\xe2\x88\x921 , the vertical wind shear might contribute a variation up \xe2\x88\xbc10% from the measured mean.\n\n4.13 URANUS AND NEPTUNE: EFFECTS OF\nLATITUDINAL VARIATIONS IN METHANE\nMIXING RATIOS\nIn 2002, using observations with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS), which included the key spectral region\nfrom 815 nm to 835 nm where methane and hydrogen absorptions have comparable but different spectral absorption signatures, Sromovsky et al. (2014) showed that the north polar\nregion of Uranus was depleted in methane by amounts comparable to those inferred for the south polar region by Karkoschka\nand Tomasko (2009) and Sromovsky et al. (2011) from 2002\nSTIS observations. An approximate variation with latitude is\nshown in Fig. 4.27. This is derived assuming that the variation\nin methane mixing ratio has the same vertical variation as at\nthe equator, except for a scale factor, and is parameterized by\nthe deep mixing ratio inferred from the scale factor variation.\nThe actual variation appears to be concentrated in the upper\ntroposphere. With the deep mixing ratio assumed constant at\nthe equatorial value, the latitudinal variation appears to be limited to pressures less than approximately 3\xe2\x80\x934 bar (Sromovsky\net al., 2014). A similar latitudinal variation of the effective\nmethane mixing ratio was observed on Neptune (Karkoschka\nand Tomasko, 2011), although high northern latitudes were not\naccessible to measurement and thus its north\xe2\x80\x93south symmetry can only be surmised by analogy with Uranus. The pattern\ninferred from STIS observations is suggestive of a downwelling\nof atmospheric motions near the polar regions and upwelling at\nlow latitudes. Microwave observations (de Pater et al., 1989;\nHofstadter et al., 2007) seem to prefer polar downwellings\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 94 \xe2\x80\x94 #116\n\n94\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nFigure 4.27 Latitudinal variation in the effective upper tropospheric\nmixing ratio derived from analysis of 2002 and 2012 STIS spectra.\nThe relative variation is scaled by absolute determinations using full\nradiative transfer model results (plotted as \xef\xac\x81lled circles). From\nSromovsky et al. (2014).\n\nreaching much greater depths than indicated by STIS results,\nand a recent multi-wavelength study of Neptune (de Pater et al.,\n2014) suggests rising motions at mid-latitudes and downwelling\nat both equator and polar regions, as suggested by earlier analysis of Voyager thermal spectra (Flasar et al., 1987). In any case,\nthe methane mixing ratio cannot be expected to be independent\nof latitude. In the following we consider one implication of such\na variation on dynamics.\nAlthough methane is a minor constituent (2\xe2\x80\x934% in volume\nmixing ratio) of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune, its\nmolecular weight is so large that variations of the mixing ratio\nwith latitude can have a signi\xef\xac\x81cant in\xef\xac\x82uence on the zonal\nwind, depending on the depth to which the latitudinal gradients\nextend. A latitudinal gradient in atmospheric density on isobars\nimplies a vertical wind shear satisfying the relation (Sun et al.,\n1991)\n\xe2\x88\x82ug /\xe2\x88\x82p =\n\n1 \xe2\x88\x82 1\n,\nf \xe2\x88\x82y \xcf\x81\n\ndyn\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere ug is the geostrophic zonal wind speed, p is pressure, f is\nthe Coriolis parameter, \xcf\x81 is density and y is the distance along\nan isobar in the direction of increasing latitude. This expression\nis a shallow atmosphere approximation. A more general expression can be found in Pedlosky (1987a).\nSince density variations can be produced by temperature\nor compositional variations, it is useful to separate these two\neffects. The following approximate separation was given by Sun\net al. (1991):\nRd\n\xe2\x88\x82ug /\xe2\x88\x82p =\n\xe2\x88\x82T/\xe2\x88\x82 y + CT \xe2\x88\x82q/\xe2\x88\x82 y ,\nfp\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere Rd is the gas constant for dry (methane-free) atmosphere,\nC = (1 \xe2\x88\x92 )/ , with = mc /md and mc and md are molecular weights of dry and condensable gas (CH4 ) respectively,\nq = \xcf\x81c /\xcf\x81d is the mixing ratio of condensable gas, and T is\ntemperature. According to these relationships, if the zonal wind\nvelocity increases with altitude, density must increase with latitude. Conversely, the decrease of density with latitude towards\nthe Uranian poles (due to methane depletion) should produce a\nnegative vertical wind shear.\nUranus\xe2\x80\x99 rotational north pole is actually its IAU south pole,\nso that the density gradient being negative in that direction\nshould make the vertical wind shear negative (i.e. opposite to\n\nFigure 4.28 The dynamical contribution to J4 (\xce\x94J4 ) as a function\nof an e-folding decay height (H) of the zonal winds for (a) Uranus and\ndyn\n(b) Neptune.

This means that\nif the vertical wind shear acted from a zero value at signi\xef\xac\x81cant depths (still only a small fraction of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s radius),\nit would integrate to a large eastward wind that would tend to\noppose the observed westward jet present in both hemispheres\nof Uranus.\n\n4.14 URANUS AND NEPTUNE: GRAVITATIONAL\nCONSTRAINTS ON THE DEPTH OF ZONAL JETS\nHow deep the cloud-top winds extend into the depths of the\natmosphere is key to understanding their overall dynamics. The\nexistence of the strong jets at the cloud-top level has been\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 95 \xe2\x80\x94 #117\n\nGas Giants\nrelated to shallow atmospheric processes within a few orders\nof magnitude of the cloud-top pressures on Uranus and Neptune (Read, 1987; Liu and Schneider, 2010; Lian and Showman, 2010), but also to processes that extend very deeply into\nthe interior (e.g., Aurnou et al., 2007). If the zonal jets extended\nto great depths they would affect the gravity \xef\xac\x81eld of the planet,\nand thus gravity measurements provide a constraint on the depth\nof the circulation (Hubbard, 1999; Kaspi et al., 2010).\nHubbard et al. (1991) used Voyager measurements of cloudtop winds and of the gravitational harmonics of Neptune to\nconclude that the differential rotation of Neptune can only\ninvolve the outermost few percent of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s mass. More\nrecently, Kaspi et al. (2013) have shown that the measured\nfourth-order gravity harmonic, J4 , constrains the zonal \xef\xac\x82ow to\nno more than the outermost 0.15% of the total mass of Uranus\nand the outermost 0.2% of the total mass of Neptune. Therefore, the dynamics appear to be con\xef\xac\x81ned to a thin weather layer\nno more than about 1000 km deep on both planets, or to within\nthe top few thousand bar rather than the previously estimated\ntop few hundred thousand bar. This analysis was obtained by\nplacing an upper limit on the difference between the observed\nJ4 and the J4 contribution of a static planet over a wide range\nof interior structures, and comparing this difference to the maximal possible contribution to J4 from dynamics (Fig. 4.28).\nPlacing such constraints for Jupiter and Saturn in a similar\nmethod using the known low-order harmonics such as J4 is\nimpossible, due to the much stronger latitudinal variation of the\nwind structure on those planets. This therefore requires better\ndetermination of the odd- and high-order gravity harmonics, as\nwill be obtained by the Juno and Cassini spacecraft for Jupiter\nand Saturn respectively in 2017.\n\n4.15 THEORIES AND MODELS FOR ZONAL\nJETS ON GIANT PLANETS\n4.15.1 Jet Structure\nBecause the giant planets rotate rapidly, the \xef\xac\x82ow at large scales\nis expected to be geostrophically balanced, implying a Rossby\nnumber Ro = U/ f L\n1, where U is a characteristic wind\nspeed, L is the characteristic \xef\xac\x82ow length scale and f = 2\xce\xa9 sin \xcf\x86\nis the Coriolis parameter. As a result, geostrophic balance is\nexpected to hold on large scales; this implies that, in the horizontal momentum equation, the dominant force balance is\nbetween pressure gradient and Coriolis forces. In such a \xef\xac\x82ow,\nthe balance equation for the three-dimensional vorticity reads\n(e.g. Pedlosky, 1987a, p. 43)\n2(\xce\xa9 \xc2\xb7 \xe2\x88\x87)v \xe2\x88\x92 2\xce\xa9(\xe2\x88\x87 \xc2\xb7 v) = \xe2\x88\x92\n\n\xe2\x88\x87\xcf\x81 \xc3\x97 \xe2\x88\x87p\n,\n\xcf\x812\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere \xce\xa9 is the planetary rotation vector, v is the threedimensional velocity vector, \xcf\x81 is density and p is pressure. Casting this equation in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on\nthe rotation axis yields\n2\xce\xa9\n\n\xe2\x88\x87\xcf\x81 \xc3\x97 \xe2\x88\x87p \xcb\x86\n\xe2\x88\x82u\n=\xe2\x88\x92\n\xc2\xb7 \xce\xbb,\n\xe2\x88\x82z\xe2\x88\x97\n\xcf\x812\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere \xce\xa9 is the rotation rate, u is the zonal wind, z\xe2\x88\x97 is the coor\xcb\x86\ndinate parallel to the rotation axis and \xce\xbb is the unit vector in the\n\n95\n\nzonal (longitudinal) direction. It can be shown that, to a good\napproximation, this equation is equivalent to (e.g., Kaspi et al.,\n2009; Showman et al., 2011a)\n2\xce\xa9\n\n\xe2\x88\x82u\ng \xe2\x88\x82\xcf\x81\n\xe2\x89\x88\n\xe2\x88\x82z\xe2\x88\x97\n\xcf\x81 \xe2\x88\x82y\n\n(4.13)\np\n\nwhere g is gravity, y is northward distance, and the derivative is\ntaken at constant pressure \xe2\x80\x93 see Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10).\nEquation (4.13) implies that if the \xef\xac\x82uid is barotropic \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that density does not vary on isobars \xe2\x80\x93 then the zonal wind\nwill be constant along coordinate surfaces parallel to the planetary rotation vector. This is similar to the standard Taylor\xe2\x80\x93\nProudman theorem (e.g. Pedlosky, 1987a) but is more general,\nbecause no assumption of constant density is required; indeed,\nEq. (4.13) holds for a barotropic, geostrophically balanced \xef\xac\x82uid\neven if the density varies by orders of magnitude across the\nsystem (as it does on Jupiter). On the other hand, if density\nvaries on isobars \xe2\x80\x93 as is observationally known to occur above\nthe cloud levels on all four giant planets, for example \xe2\x80\x93 then\nthe zonal wind will vary along surfaces parallel to the rotation axis. This is similar to the standard shallow-atmosphere\nthermal-wind equation (e.g. Holton, 2004, p. 70).\nGiven this framework, early studies suggested two possible\nscenarios for the structure of the zonal jets on the giant planets.\nConvective mixing tends to homogenize the entropy, and it is\ntypically assumed that this will lead to deviations from a barotropic state that are small in the interiors of the giant planets.\nIf so, the zonal wind should be relatively constant on surfaces\nparallel to the rotation axis \xe2\x80\x93 Eq. (4.13). In one scenario it is\ntypically assumed that these deep winds are small relative to\nthose measured in the cloud layer, and that the zonal jets die\nout within several scale heights of the cloud layer (e.g., Hess\nand Panofsky, 1951; Ingersoll and Cuzzi, 1969). This would\nrequire signi\xef\xac\x81cant variations of density on isobars within and\nimmediately below the cloud level \xe2\x80\x93 Eq. (4.13) \xe2\x80\x93 which might\nresult from latent heating or radiative effects such as absorption of sunlight or IR cooling to space that differs between belts\nand zones. Other studies, however, argued that the fast winds\nobserved at the cloud level continued in a nearly barotropic\nfashion on cylinders through the interior (e.g. Busse, 1976). As\nemphasized by Vasavada and Showman (2005), hybrid scenarios are also possible where signi\xef\xac\x81cant thermal wind shear in the\nstably strati\xef\xac\x81ed portion of the atmosphere is superposed on fast,\nnearly barotropic zonal jets in the interior.\nOf course, convective transport of the interior heat \xef\xac\x82ux on\ngiant planets implies that ascending and descending convective\nplumes have differing temperatures and therefore that the interior is not in a barotropic state. Is is worth asking how strong the\ndeviations from barotropicity will be. This question is currently\ndif\xef\xac\x81cult to address with direct numerical simulations, because\nthree-dimensional models of convection in the interior of the\ngiant planets are overforced, meaning that they adopt heat \xef\xac\x82uxes\nmuch too large, which may lead to density variations much\ngreater than those occurring in the interiors of the giant planets.\nMotivated by this dif\xef\xac\x81culty, several authors have applied scaling\nlaws to estimate the density variations and hence, via Eq. (4.13),\nthe thermal wind shear in the deep interior. These estimates suggest that, at heat \xef\xac\x82uxes relevant to the giant planets, the zonal\nwinds in the deep molecular envelope are indeed nearly baro-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 96 \xe2\x80\x94 #118\n\n96\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\ntropic, with variation of zonal wind throughout the interior (on\nsurfaces parallel to \xce\xa9) that are small compared to the typical\namplitude of wind observed in the cloud layer (Liu et al., 2008;\nShowman and Polvani, 2010; Showman et al., 2011b; Showman and Kaspi, 2013). Nevertheless, these scaling arguments\nremain tentative; careful numerical simulations and extrapolations to the Jovian regime may allow better assessments of the\npossible amplitudes of wind shear in the interior.\n\n4.15.2 Mechanisms for Driving the Jets\nVasavada and Showman (2005) provided a detailed review of\ntheories and models for driving the jets on the giant planets;\nhere, we recap only the key points and summarize developments over the past eight years or so. Two categories of model\nhave been invoked to explain the jets on the giant planets. In\none, dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cshallow forcing\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, the jets are driven\nby baroclinic instabilities, moist convection or other processes\nin the outermost layers of the planet. These scenarios have\ntypically been investigated with atmospheric models adapted\nfrom the terrestrial geophysical \xef\xac\x82uid dynamics (GFD) community. In another, dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cdeep forcing\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, convection throughout the molecular envelope (a layer \xe2\x88\xbc104 km thick)\ndrives differential rotation in the interior, which manifests as\njets at cloud level. These scenarios have been investigated with\nBoussinesq and anelastic convection models that share signi\xef\xac\x81cant heritage with models used by the geodynamo community.\nObservations on Jupiter and Saturn indicate that eddies at the\ncloud level transport momentum into the cores of the zonal jets\n(Salyk et al., 2006; Del Genio et al., 2007; Del Genio and Barbara, 2012) \xe2\x80\x93 see Section 4.8. The amplitude of this forcing is\nsuf\xef\xac\x81ciently large that the eddies must be atmospheric in nature,\ni.e., the amplitudes of u v associated with these eddies cannot extend more than a few bar into the interior. Thus, shallow, cloud-level forcing is strongly implicated in driving the\njets. Eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82uxes in the deep interior could also contribute, but observations are not yet able to assess this issue.\nIt is important to emphasize that the issue of shallow or deep\nforcing of the jets is distinct from the issue of shallow or deep\nstructure of the jets (Vasavada and Showman, 2005; Showman\net al., 2006). Even if the eddy accelerations that drive the jets\nare localized to the atmosphere, the jets themselves could potentially extend deep into the interior (Showman et al., 2006; Lian\nand Showman, 2008). On the other hand, some recent models of convection in the deep interior suggest that the jets may\nbe strongest toward the outer layers of the planet (e.g. Kaspi\net al., 2009). A related point is that the issue of deep versus\nshallow forcing, as de\xef\xac\x81ned above, is not equivalent to the issue\nof whether the jets are driven by \xe2\x80\x9csolar heat\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinternal heat.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor example, moist convection is a fundamentally atmospheric\nprocess; condensation of water occurs at pressures of \xe2\x88\xbc6\xe2\x80\x938 bar\non Jupiter, and models of this process suggest that it generates\nmomentum \xef\xac\x82uxes localized to the upper troposphere (Lian and\nShowman, 2010). However, most sunlight is absorbed at pressures less than several bar (P\xc3\xa9rez-Hoyos and S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega,\n2006b), so the heat \xef\xac\x82ux transported by moist convection \xe2\x80\x93\ndespite its shallow nature \xe2\x80\x93 is primarily linked to the interior\nheat \xef\xac\x82ux. Dietrich et al. (2017) have recently studied the effects\n\nof thermal gradients and thermal winds in the upper layer with\ngeostrophic zonal \xef\xac\x82ows.\n4.15.3 Jets from Shallow-Layer Forcing\nAtmospheric jet formation scenarios generally assume that the\njets result from the interaction of large-scale atmospheric turbulence with the \xce\xb2 effect arising from the gradient in the Coriolis parameter with latitude. A hierarchy of models have been\nexplored. One-layer systems that have been applied to the giant\nplanets include the horizontally nondivergent two-dimensional\nmodel, the one-layer quasi-geostrophic (QG) model and the\nshallow-water model. Most of the three-dimensional investigations have adopted the primitive equations, although a few\nmulti-layer QG investigations of giant planet atmospheres have\nalso been carried out.\nIn one-layer models, the turbulence that drives the \xef\xac\x82ow and\norganizes into jets must be injected by hand; this is typically\nperformed by introducing small-scale sources of vorticity to\nparameterize the effect of convection or baroclinic instabilities\non the cloud-layer \xef\xac\x82ow. Under the rapidly rotating conditions\nappropriate to the giant planets, such models typically show\nthat multiple zonal jets and vortices can form from small-scale\nforcing (see Vasavada and Showman, 2005, for a review). Typically, the meridional jet width is close to the Rhines scale,\n(U/ \xce\xb2) 1/2 . Most work to date has been done using the twodimensional, horizontally nondivergent model (Fig. 4.7). This\nsystem provides the simplest and cleanest environment in which\nto understand the interaction of atmospheric turbulence with the\n\xce\xb2 effect, but it ignores buoyancy effects, lacks gravity waves\nand exhibits a Rossby deformation radius that is in\xef\xac\x81nite (in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn, where the deformation is a few percent of the planetary radius). While numerical simulations with\nsuch models can generate zonal jets, these jets do not exhibit the\nequatorial intensi\xef\xac\x81cation of the jet speed that occurs on Jupiter\nand Saturn (e.g., Nozawa and Yoden, 1997; Huang and Robinson, 1998, and many others). When strong jets are present, such\nmodels typically also do not reproduce the rich array of stable,\nlong-lived vortices occurring on Jupiter. This may result from\nthe absence of a deformation radius in this system. This class\nof model is best viewed as a process model of jet formation in\na simple environment rather than realistic circulation models of\nJupiter and Saturn.\nOne-layer shallow-water models provide a more realistic\nrepresentation by including buoyancy effects (in the form of\na spatially variable layer thickness), which allows the existence of gravity waves and other buoyancy-related effects while\nstill ignoring the details of atmospheric vertical structure. The\ndeformation radius is \xef\xac\x81nite, and thus this model and the related\none-layer QG model are the simplest models that can explore\nthe effects of the deformation radius on the atmospheric \xef\xac\x82ow.\nAt present there are only a few forced\xe2\x80\x93dissipative studies of jet\nformation on the giant planets using the shallow-water equations. Showman (2007) forced the \xef\xac\x82ow by introducing localized\nmass sources, intended to represent the mass transport by moist\nconvection (i.e., thunderstorms) into the upper troposphere.\nScott and Polvani (2007) introduced a more globally continuous forcing in an otherwise similar study. Both investigations\nshowed that multiple zonal jets like those on the giant planets\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 97 \xe2\x80\x94 #119\n\nGas Giants\ncan result from the small-scale forcing. Li et al. (2006) used\na one-layer QG study, adopted localized forcing and likewise\nshowed the emergence of multiple zonal jets. Unlike most twodimensional nondivergent investigations, Jovian-like vortices\noccur naturally in these shallow-water \xef\xac\x82ows. Extending earlier\ntheoretical work in the QG system, Okuno and Masuda (2003)\nand Smith (2004) showed how zonal jets can be suppressed\nwhen the deformation radius is suf\xef\xac\x81ciently small, leading to a\n\xef\xac\x82ow dominated by vortices instead.\nInterestingly, unlike the two-dimensional nondivergent system, forced\xe2\x80\x93dissipative shallow-water turbulence naturally produces an intensi\xef\xac\x81cation of the jet speed at the equator relative to mid-latitudes. Under Jovian conditions (Ro \xe2\x88\xbc 0.01 and\ndeformation radii a few percent of the planetary radius), most\nshallow-water studies produce a westward equatorial jet (Cho\nand Polvani, 1996a; Iacono et al., 1999; Showman, 2007; Scott\nand Polvani, 2007). This may provide a reasonable description\nof the dynamics on Uranus and Neptune, but is inconsistent with\nthe equatorial superrotating jets on Jupiter and Saturn. More\nrecently, however, Scott and Polvani (2008) presented shallowwater simulations demonstrating the emergence of a strong\neastward equatorial jet from small-scale forcing and large-scale\ndamping under Jovian conditions. They argued that the de\xef\xac\x81ning\ningredient allowing the eastward jet in their model is the use\nof radiative rather than frictional damping, but this is inconsistent with the results of Showman (2007), who found westward\nequatorial jets in models that were radiatively damped. It seems\nlikely that particular combinations of both forcing and damping\nare necessary. However, the speci\xef\xac\x81c dynamical mechanism that\nallows the emergence of the eastward equatorial jet in the Scott\nand Polvani (2008) model remains to be identi\xef\xac\x81ed, and it is not\nclear from their model why one would expect eastward equatorial \xef\xac\x82ow on Jupiter and Saturn but westward equatorial \xef\xac\x82ow on\nUranus and Neptune. Future work would be useful to clarify the\nmechanisms controlling the equatorial jet in the shallow-water\nsystem and to assess its relevance to the equatorial jets on the\nfour giant planets.\nThe stability of the zonal jets is an intriguing topic that\nremains incompletely understood. At most latitudes, the\nobserved zonal jet patterns on Jupiter and Saturn have remained\nremarkably constant in time, exhibiting little change in the\nspeed or latitudes of the jets between the Voyager \xef\xac\x82yby and\nCassini observations (Fig. 4.13). The main exception is Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s\nbroad equatorial jet, which seems to have exhibited a slowdown\nbetween the Voyager and Cassini eras, although a few of the\nJupiter and Saturn off-equatorial jets have also exhibited modest changes. This overall constancy of the zonal jets on decadal\ntimescales argues that the jets are dynamically stable or perhaps\nclose to neutral. In this regard, a puzzling observation is that,\nat certain latitudes, the zonal-mean value of \xce\xb2 \xe2\x88\x92 Uyy changes\nsign on both Jupiter and Saturn, implying that the jets violate\nthe barotropic stability criterion. Calculation of Ertel\xe2\x80\x99s potential vorticity is more dif\xef\xac\x81cult because it requires knowledge of\nthermal structure in addition to vorticity. Nevertheless, recent\ndata analyses by Read et al. (2009) show that the meridional\ngradient in zonal-mean PV seems to exhibit sign changes at several latitudes, implying that the jets violate the Charney\xe2\x80\x93Stern\nstability criterion for baroclinic instability as well. Technically,\nsince these are only necessary (but not suf\xef\xac\x81cient) conditions for\n\n97\n\ninstability, violation of these stability criteria does not imply\nthat the \xef\xac\x82uid is unstable, but rather simply that the stability\ncriterion provides no information. Nevertheless, numerical simulations of atmospheric turbulence using two-dimensional and\nshallow-water models generally produce jet pro\xef\xac\x81les that are\nstable against these criteria, which suggests that the violation\nof the criteria on Jupiter and Saturn is a real issue that needs\nexplaining.\nDowling (1993, 1995a,b, 2014) and Read et al. (2009)\nargued that Jupiter and Saturn are close to neutrally stable with\nrespect to another stability criterion due to Arnol\xe2\x80\x99d, despite the\nobserved sign reversals in the meridional PV gradient. One way\nthat a \xef\xac\x82ow can be stable in the presence of sign reversals of\nthe PV gradient is if the zonal jets are underlain by a nonzero\nzonal \xef\xac\x82ow in the deeper troposphere. In the context of a 1.5layer shallow-water model, this would be equivalent to assuming that the abyssal layer contains nonzero zonal jets, which\nthen in\xef\xac\x82uence the stability properties of the overlying weather\nlayer. Indeed, if the jets in the weather layer are neutral to\nArnol\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99s second stability criterion, it is possible to infer the\nstructure of the jets in the underlying abyssal layer from the\nobserved jet properties, given information (or plausible assumptions) about the vertical strati\xef\xac\x81cation (Dowling, 1993, 1995a).\nThus, these stability-criterion arguments provide tentative evidence that the off-equatorial zonal jets (to which Arnol\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99s stability theorems apply best) extend at least some considerable\ndistance into Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s interior. Nevertheless, these 1.5-layer stability arguments have yet to address the question of whether\nor how the required abyssal-layer jets are stable; thus, rather\nthan solving the stability puzzle, these investigations are essentially shifting the puzzle one layer deeper into the atmosphere.\nLian and Showman (2008) presented three-dimensional turbulent models of tropospheric dynamics in which the jets tend\ntoward neutrality with respect to Arnol\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99s second stability criterion, including in some cases reversals in the sign of the PV\ngradient. This is encouraging, but more work is needed in this\narea.\nIngersoll and Pollard (1982) suggested a modi\xef\xac\x81ed stability\ncriterion due to the interior dynamics being controlled by convectively driven columns which have effectively an opposite\nbeta effect (due to columns being stretched as they move poleward, rather than squeezed in a thin atmosphere). They derive a\nmodi\xef\xac\x81ed stability criteriion where \xe2\x88\x923 \xce\xb2 \xe2\x88\x92 Uyy becomes the condition for barotropic instability, and indeed the jets on Jupiter\nand Saturn do not violate this stability criterion. Using a twolayer model with a deep abyssal layer with such a negative beta\neffect, Kaspi and Flierl (2007) showed that under such con\xef\xac\x81guration, multiple stable, barocliniclly driven, jets emerge; as on\nthe real planets, these jets violate the condition that Uyy \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb2 does\nnot change sign, but are stable in reference to the Ingersoll and\nPollard (1982) stability criterion.\nThree-dimensional models have the advantage that they allow\nvortex stretching and baroclinic effects that can play a major\nrole in determining the properties of macroturbulence and the\njet structure. The injection scale of baroclinic instability, for\nexample, is proportional to the Rossby deformation radius\n(Eady, 1949; Rhines, 1979; Salmon, 1978; Merlis and Schneider, 2009). If energy is halted at the Rhines scale, then the scale\nseparation between the Rhines scale and the Rossby deforma-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 98 \xe2\x80\x94 #120\n\n98\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\ntion radius, which follows the QG supercriticality (Held and\nLarichev, 1996), can imply the importance of inverse energy\ncascade and eddy\xe2\x80\x93eddy interactions in the atmosphere (Jansen\nand Ferrari, 2012; Chemke and Kaspi, 2015a). Both analysis\nof Jupiter observations (Theiss, 2006) and three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of Jupiter (Sayanagi et al., 2008) suggest that the latitude where supercriticality equals one plays\nan important role in determining turbulence isotropy: regions\nwhere supercriticality is larger than one will be more isotropic\nand dominated by vortices, while equatorward regions where\nsupercriticality is less than one are dominated by jets. Chemke\nand Kaspi (2015a) found that poleward (equatorward) of the\nlatitude where supercriticality equals one, eddy\xe2\x80\x93eddy (eddy\xe2\x80\x93\nmean) interactions are most dominant in maintaining the jets.\nYet, despite the apparent importance of eddy\xe2\x80\x93eddy interactions\nin the process of jet formation, Chemke and Kaspi (2015a)\nshowed that even in three-dimensional simulations where eddy\xe2\x80\x93\neddy interactions are omitted, Rhines scale multiple jets form\nand can reach to high latitudes where their stability is maintained by eddy\xe2\x80\x93mean interactions.\nSigni\xef\xac\x81cant advances have been made over the past few years\non fully three-dimensional atmospheric models of Jovian dynamics. Following on from early work by Williams (2003b) and\nothers, Lian and Showman (2008) presented three-dimensional\nprimitive equation models showing that baroclinic instabilities\nin the cloud layer \xe2\x80\x93 driven by meridional temperature contrasts\nassociated with the latitudinal insolation gradient and/or beltzone temperature variations \xe2\x80\x93 can generate multiple zonal jets,\nand that these jets can penetrate far below the level of the forcing. The statistical distribution of eddy accelerations (e.g., the\ndistributions of u v ) in their model exhibits a strong resemblance to the distributions of u v measured on Jupiter and Saturn. Like the jets on Jupiter and Saturn, the Lian and Showman (2008) models exhibited pro\xef\xac\x81les of zonal-mean potential\nvorticity that violate the Charney\xe2\x80\x93Stern stability criterion and\ntrend toward neutrality with respect to Arnol\xe2\x80\x99d\xe2\x80\x99s second stability criterion (Dowling, 1995b). Moreover, when sharp meridional temperature gradients are introduced near the equator,\nequatorial superrotation emerged, consistent with earlier results\nby Williams (2003b).\nSeveral global atmospheric models have now been published\nthat explain the overall features of the atmospheric circulation on all four giant planets, including multiple zonal jets\nin the mid-to-high latitudes of Jupiter and Saturn, the threejet patterns on Uranus and Neptune, the existence of equatorial superrotation on Jupiter and Saturn, and the existence\nof equatorial subrotation on Uranus and Neptune. Lian and\nShowman (2010) introduced a hydrological cycle to test the\nidea that large-scale latent heating plays a crucial role in the\ncloud-level circulation (e.g. Ingersoll et al., 2000). Figure 4.29\nshows an example of their results. In addition to explaining the\noverall circulation patterns of all four planets and the transition in equatorial jet direction between Jupiter/Saturn on the\none hand and Uranus/Neptune on the other, the Jupiter and\nSaturn models by Lian and Showman (2010) produce localized \xe2\x80\x9cstorm\xe2\x80\x9d features that bear a strong qualitative similarity\nto moist-convective storm events observed on Jupiter and Saturn (see Section 4.5). Schneider and Liu (2009) presented dry\nprimitive-equation models for Jupiter, forced by a meridional\n\nFigure 4.29 Atmospheric \xef\xac\x82ow on the giant planets in\nthree-dimensional circulation models from Lian and Showman (2010).\nThe globes depict the zonal wind (given in scale bars in m s\xe2\x88\x921 ) for\nsimulations of Jupiter (top row), Saturn (middle row) and a case\nrepresenting Uranus and Neptune (bottom row). The left column\nshows an oblique view and the right column shows the view looking\ndown over the north pole. In these models, the circulation is driven by\nlarge-scale latent heating associated with condensation of water,\nwhich is assumed to be 3, 5 and 30 times solar in the Jupiter, Saturn\nand Uranus/Neptune models, respectively. Consistent with\nobservations, numerous zonal jets including equatorial superrotation\nemerge in the Jupiter and Saturn models, while a broad jet pattern\nincluding equatorial westward \xef\xac\x82ow and high-latitude eastward \xef\xac\x82ow\nemerges on Uranus and Neptune. These are the \xef\xac\x81rst models to\nself-consistently capture the dichotomy in equatorial jet direction\nbetween Jupiter/Saturn on the one hand and Uranus/Neptune on the\nother in the context of a single model.\n\nsolar-heating gradient and by a simple dry-convective parameterization, that show the emergence of equatorial superrotation\nand multiple off-equatorial jets under Jovian conditions. Liu\nand Schneider (2010) subsequently extended this model to all\nfour giant planets; this, like Lian and Showman (2010), shows a\ntransition from equatorial superrotation on Jupiter and Saturn to\nequatorial subrotation on Uranus and Neptune. Taken together,\nthese models are major successes and show how atmospheric\nturbulence can explain observations at the cloud levels of the\ngiant planets. Nevertheless, some details, such as the existence\nand locations of major vortices like the Great Red Spot and the\ndetails of the zonal jet pro\xef\xac\x81les versus latitude, were not reproduced, so additional work will clearly be useful.\n\n4.15.4 Jets from Deep Forcing\nAround the same time as when the mechanisms for jet formation on giant planets by shallow geostrophic turbulence\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 99 \xe2\x80\x94 #121\n\nGas Giants\nemerged (e.g., Rhines, 1975, 1979; Williams, 1978, 1979), a\ncompletely alternative approach suggesting that the observed\njets are a surface manifestation of concentric cylinders parallel to the axis of rotation also emerged (Busse, 1976, 1994).\nThese theories were based on the fact that if the interior convection homogenizes entropy gradients, then the interior may\nbe nearly barotropic (the right-hand term in Eq. (4.13) is zero),\nthus allowing the formation of Taylor columns in the interior.\nThe nonlinear interaction of these convectively driven columns\nhas been shown to generate equatorial superrotation and possibly high-latitude jets. The theories discussing this mechanism\nare summarized in a review by Busse (2002) and are discussed\nin detail by Vasavada and Showman (2005).\nModels of jets formed by interior convection generally investigate the idea that convectively generated Reynolds stresses in\nthe molecular envelopes of the giant planets can cause largescale, organized differential rotation within the interior, which\nmanifests at atmospheric level as multiple zonal jets. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, advances were con\xef\xac\x81ned mostly to analytic studies, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations\nin the linear or weakly nonlinear regime. Only over the past \xe2\x88\xbc15\nyears have computational resources been suf\xef\xac\x81cient to explore\nfully three-dimensional convection in rotating spherical shells\nunder strongly nonlinear conditions relevant to the giant planets. Most such models to date have been Boussinesq models\nthat adopt a constant basic-state density and an incompressibility continuity equation, \xe2\x88\x87 \xc2\xb7 v = 0. Over the past \xef\xac\x81ve years, however, several authors have investigated anelastic models, which\nallow the basic-state density to vary radially and adopt a continuity equation \xe2\x88\x87 \xc2\xb7 ( \xcf\x81v), where \xcf\x81 is the speci\xef\xac\x81ed basic-state\n\xc2\xaf\n\xc2\xaf\ndensity that is a function of radius. Both classes of model \xef\xac\x81lter\nacoustic waves from the dynamics, which is reasonable under\nJovian conditions.\nPublished Boussinesq models of convection in rotating spherical shells applicable to the giant planets are generally performed with constant-temperature boundary conditions (hot at\nthe inner boundary, cold at the outer boundary) and also assume\nthat the thermal expansivity and other \xef\xac\x82uid properties are constant with radius. When the Rayleigh number (vigor convection) is suf\xef\xac\x81ciently large and the Ekman number is suf\xef\xac\x81ciently\nsmall, these models produce strong zonal \xef\xac\x82ow with speeds that\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cantly exceed the convective velocities. When carried\nout in spherical geometry, the equatorial surface \xef\xac\x82ow is eastward in these models, consistent with Jupiter and Saturn but\ninconsistent with Uranus and Neptune. Early models adopted\na thick shell, with an inner to outer radius ratio of 0.7 or less\n(e.g., Christensen, 2001, 2002; Aurnou and Olson, 2001). These\nthick-shell models generally produce only a few zonal jets with\nan equatorial jet that is much wider than those on Jupiter and\nSaturn. The equatorial jet width in these models is directly controlled by the shell thickness; at the equator, the zonal-wind\nspeed varies smoothly from a peak eastward speed at the outer\nboundary to a peak westward speed at the inner boundary,\nwhich means that the latitude of the westward jet closest to the\nequator is equal to the latitude at which the so-called \xe2\x80\x9ctangent\ncylinder\xe2\x80\x9d outcrops at the surface.\nMotivated by this, Heimpel et al. (2005) and Heimpel and\nAurnou (2007) showed that, if the shell is thin (with an inner\nto outer radius ratio of \xe2\x88\xbc0.9), then the equatorial jet width is\n\n99\n\nFigure 4.30 Zonal winds in a three-dimensional model of convection\nin a thin spherical shell from Heimpel et al. (2005). The ratio of the\ninner and outer radii in the model is 0.9. The model is Boussinesq and\nthus ignores the increase of mean density with depth that occurs on the\ngiant planets. Equatorial superrotation and multiple off-equatorial jets\nemerge, qualitatively similar to those on Jupiter.\n\ncomparable to those on Jupiter and Saturn, and the \xef\xac\x82ow inside\nof the tangent cylinder organizes into multiple zonal jets. The\nsimilarity of these zonal-\xef\xac\x82ow pro\xef\xac\x81les to those on Jupiter and\nSaturn is a major success (see Fig. 4.30). Still, the fact that the\n\xef\xac\x82ow behavior is so strongly controlled by the lower boundary\n\xe2\x80\x93 a boundary that does not exist on Jupiter and Saturn \xe2\x80\x93 raises\nsome questions about the extent to which these exquisite results\ncarry over to Jupiter and Saturn themselves. These models also\nnaturally produce a greater heat \xef\xac\x82ux at the poles than at low\nlatitudes, which may help explain the near constancy of the total\n(solar + interior) heat \xef\xac\x82ux with latitude on Jupiter and Saturn\n(Aurnou et al., 2008).\nOn Jupiter and Saturn, the mean density varies by more than\nfour orders of magnitude from the 1 bar level to the deep interior, and this density variation almost certainly will exert important effects on the dynamics. Recently, several anelastic models\nhave been published that incorporate radial density variations\nand explore their role in controlling the jet properties. These\nmodels started with two-dimensional models in the equatorial\nplane, whose goal is to understand how the compressibility\nhelps control the emergence of differential rotation (Evonuk and\nGlatzmaier, 2004, 2006, 2007; Glatzmaier et al., 2009) These\nstudies have suggested a mechanism for differential rotation\nwhere local generation of vorticity is produced by the expansion of convectively rising \xef\xac\x82uid and contraction of sinking \xef\xac\x82uid.\nConservation of potential vorticity governs the rate at which\nvorticity is produced as \xef\xac\x82uid rises and sinks in the strati\xef\xac\x81ed density \xef\xac\x81eld.\nKaspi (2008) developed the \xef\xac\x81rst three-dimensional anelastic\ngeneral circulation model for giant planets. The model, based on\nthe nonhydrostatic MITgcm, accounts for the full four-order-ofmagnitude variation in density in the interior of giant planets,\nand uses a realistic equation of state designed for hydrogen\xe2\x80\x93\nhelium high-pressure interiors (Saumon et al., 1995). They have\nfound that, as in the Boussinesq case, conservation of angular\nmomentum constrains the \xef\xac\x82ow to be only along cylinders concentric to the axis of rotation; however, in the anelastic case, this\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 100 \xe2\x80\x94 #122\n\n100\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nazimuthal \xef\xac\x82ow develops shear along the direction of the spin\naxis. This shear is due to the fact that entropy gradients generated by the internal convection drive the system away from a\nbarotropic state resulting in baroclinic shear, Eq. (4.13) becoming\n2\xce\xa9 \xc2\xb7 \xe2\x88\x87u = \xce\xb1 s \xe2\x88\x87s \xc3\x97 g,\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere s are the entropy perturbations from an adiabatic state,\n1\nand \xce\xb1 s = \xcf\x81 \xe2\x88\x82\xcf\x81 is the entropy expansion coef\xef\xac\x81cient along\n\xe2\x88\x82s p\nisobars (Kaspi et al., 2009). Since this expansion coef\xef\xac\x81cient\nvaries signi\xef\xac\x81cantly with depth, so does the rate of the shear\nalong the direction of the spin axis. Anelastic models using ideal\ngas equations of state in which such an expansion coef\xef\xac\x81cient is\nconstant have shown only weak shear in the interior (e.g., Jones\net al., 2009; Gastine and Wicht, 2012; Cai and Chan, 2012).\nAll three-dimensional anelastic GCMs exhibit superrotation\nat the equator, similar to the Boussinesq models. The mechanism involves Reynolds stress convergences, that is, convergences of eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82uxes in the meridional plane, as a\nresult of correlations between the zonal velocity and the radial\nand/or meridional velocity component. In this sense, the process\nfor developing superrotation in three-dimensional convective\nmodels is analogous to that occurring in strati\xef\xac\x81ed shallowatmosphere models (although the speci\xef\xac\x81c physical mechanism\n\nFigure 4.31 Snapshots in the equatorial plane of two anelastic,\nthree-dimensional simulations illustrating how the correlation between\nthe convective velocity components depends on the supercriticality\n(from Showman et al., 2011b, Fig. 5). Each slice shows half of the\nequatorial plane of one simulation (note, however, that the simulations\neach span 360\xe2\x97\xa6 of longitude). Color depicts streamfunction, and the\narrows denote the velocity component in the equatorial plane. The left\nsimulation is weakly supercritical; the strong correlation between\noutward and eastward velocity components is obvious. The right\nsimulation is strongly supercritical; the correlation between the\noutward and eastward velocity components is weaker because of the\ncomplex, turbulent convective structure. In both cases the momentum\n\xef\xac\x82ux convergence leads to equatorial superrotation.\n\nfor inducing the velocity correlation differs between the cases).\nHere, in the three-dimensional case, convection columns which\nform parallel to the direction of the spin axis are tilted eastward and outward (Fig. 4.31) due to refraction by the background planetary vorticity (Kaspi, 2008). This tilt leads to a\npositive correlation between the zonal eddy velocity and the\nvelocity component in the direction toward or away from the\nrotation axis (Showman et al., 2011b). This is analogous to\nthe zonal/meridional velocity correlations that occur in a twodimensional \xef\xac\x82ow on the surface of a sphere (caused in that case,\nfor example, by generation, meridional propagation and breaking of Rossby waves; see, e.g., Vallis, 2006, Section 12.1). In\nboth cases, meridional and/or radial momentum convergence\nand the formation of zonal jets results.\nAnelastic simulations that are relatively shallow show similar\nbehavior to the Boussinesq simulations where the depth of the\nlower boundary controls the latitudinal extent of the superrotation region. However, anelastic simulations with a deeper bottom boundary (i.e., an inner to outer radius ratio that is signi\xef\xac\x81cantly less than 1) have shown that the location of this region of\neddy momentum \xef\xac\x82ux convergence and superrotation is almost\ninvariant to the location of the bottom boundary, but rather is a\nproperty related to the strati\xef\xac\x81cation of the \xef\xac\x82uid (Kaspi, 2008;\nCai and Chan, 2012). Thus, in the anelastic simulations the\nconvective columns form at a characteristic depth which then\ncontrols the region of eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82ux convergence and\nsuperrotation.\nSeveral studies have explored the transition between the rotationally dominated regime (exhibiting Taylor columns equatorial superrotation) and a buoyancy-dominated regime (generally\nlacking equatorial superrotation). Aurnou et al. (2007) suggested that this transition is what separates Jupiter and Saturn\nfrom Uranus and Neptune, where the latter are in the buoyancydriven regime where convection columns parallel to the axis\nof rotation do not form and therefore equatorial superrotation does not occur. However, Uranus and Neptune are both\nrapidly rotating planets (\xe2\x88\xbc17 and \xe2\x88\xbc16 hr, respectively), where\non Uranus the interior heat \xef\xac\x82ux is very weak and on Neptune\nit is almost twice as large as the total solar heat \xef\xac\x82ux. Therefore, there seems to be no simple reason why Uranus and Neptune would be in a regime different from that of Jupiter and\nSaturn. Kaspi et al. (2009) presented a series of experiments\nwhere the ratio between the rotational and convective timescale\nwas varied systematically, and showed that for a Jupiter-like\nplanet the transition from a superrotating equator to a subrotating equator will be around a rotation period of 50 hr. Gastine et al. (2013) presented similar simulations showing the\ntransition between the rotational and buoyancy-driven regimes.\nHeimpel et al. (2016) presented simulations combining deepseated zonal jets and the formation of vortices in a shallow\nlayer.\nA major challenge regarding all internal convection models\n(both Boussinesq and anelastic) is that in order to simulate\nturbulent convection at high Rayleigh numbers these models\nmust be over-forced by 5\xe2\x80\x9310 orders of magnitude in order to\ncompensate for the high numerical viscosity required in such\nsimulations. Christensen (2002) attempted to bridge this gap\nby suggesting a scaling to the real Jupiter regime, but from the\nBoussinesq model it is dif\xef\xac\x81cult to reliably extract the expected\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 101 \xe2\x80\x94 #123\n\nGas Giants\n\xef\xac\x82ow velocities in the interior. Using an anelastic model, Showman et al. (2011b) showed that the \xef\xac\x82ow behavior can be divided\ninto three distinct circulation regimes: two are controlled by\nthe balance between the viscosity and thermal forcing of the\nmodel; in the third, at suf\xef\xac\x81ciently large heat \xef\xac\x82ux, or at suf\xef\xac\x81ciently small viscosity, the wind speeds become independent\nof the viscosity and might be representative of the dynamics\nof the real planets. However, this third regime can now only\nbe barely achieved by numerical simulations. Since simulations with any realistic heat \xef\xac\x82ux will be impossible in the near\nfuture, any interpretation of deep models to the planets will\nrequire scaling laws to bridge over these regimes. Nonetheless, these models serve as excellent process models to study\nthe behavior of three-dimensional turbulence in giant planet\ninteriors.\n\n4.16 FUTURE RESEARCH\nCurrent and future goals in giant planet research are split into\ntwo broad areas. First, there are new observations and associated proposed spacecraft missions; second, the modeling\nand theoretical work required to understand these and past\nobservations.\n4.16.1 Observational Goals\nMany aspects of giant planet atmospheres remain poorly understood, particularly the nature and behavior of the atmosphere\nat depth, below the visible cloud tops. Future observations are\nbased around two approaches: new instrumentation to probe\ndeeper into planetary interiors, and higher-resolution observations at the cloud level and above.\nAt depth, probably the most important question for the two\ngas giants is to determine the depth of the jets and whether the\njets at cloud level are a shallow \xe2\x80\x9cweather layer\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon,\nreaching down to a few tens of bar, or the intersection between\nthe planet\xe2\x80\x99s surface and counterrotating cylindrical columns\nthat extend throughout the whole \xef\xac\x82uid envelope (Busse, 1976).\nThis question was recently resolved in favor of a shallow\nweather layer for both Uranus and Neptune (Kaspi et al., 2013).\nFor Jupiter and Saturn it requires more accurate measurements\nof the gravitational moments or new techniques for probing\nbeneath the cloud deck.\nFor all four giant planets the deep water abundance is still an\nopen question. Future observations should aim to measure this\nand the lowest condensation level for all four planets. The water\nabundance constrains possible energy sources for moist convection and latent heating, which are thought to be responsible for\ninjecting energy into the \xef\xac\x82ow to drive the eddies and jets. The\nGalileo probe recorded an unexpectedly low water abundance\nin Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere (Niemann et al., 1998), thought to be a\nresult of entering the atmosphere in a 5 \xce\xbcm hot spot (Showman\nand Dowling, 2000). It is not known whether this is characteristic of the planet as a whole.\nAt the cloud level, increased observational resolution along\nwith greater temporal and spatial coverage is required to understand several aspects of the dynamics. High-resolution measurements of winds are required for evaluation of the eddy\n\n101\n\nmomentum \xef\xac\x82ux and, combined with higher-resolution temperature measurements, the other terms in the Lorenz (1955) energy\ncycle. These measurements will determine how important baroclinic conversion processes are on the giant planets. A capability is also desired for observing winds at deeper levels to\nsuf\xef\xac\x81cient accuracy to measure barotropic conversions, which\ncan be linked to those measured at the visible cloud levels and\npotential vorticity pro\xef\xac\x81le features retrieved for the upper atmospheres (of Jupiter and Saturn, so far). Dedicated long-term\nhigh-resolution continuous monitoring of atmospheric cloud\nmotions will allow the time variability of the eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82ux to be measured, along with other turbulent diagnostics requiring long time-averaging. Available high-resolution\ndatasets for Jupiter exist over a much shorter time period than,\nsay, the radiative timescale, and while Saturn has seen longtimescale observations, instantaneous coverage has not been\nglobal. Such high-resolution observations would also be useful\nfor studying atmospheric waves and their role in transporting\nenergy, and wind variability in regions containing large-scale\nmorphological changes such as the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 storm on Saturn (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al., 2011; Garc\xc3\xada-Melendo et al., 2013;\nSayanagi et al., 2013); see Fig. 4.9.\nFully three-dimensional wind \xef\xac\x81elds incorporating the stratosphere are desirable. Above the visible cloud deck winds can be\nestimated using the thermal wind equation, but Doppler imaging would allow winds to be measured directly from the cloud\nlevel into the stratosphere.\nIt is unknown whether cloud tracking techniques that purport to produce instantaneous two-dimensional velocity \xef\xac\x81elds\nare actually capable of producing information content down\nto spatial scales and velocity perturbation amplitudes needed\nto truly characterize the eddy kinetic energy spectrum over a\nuseful range of wavenumbers. Some effort has been made to\naddress these concerns in the context of arti\xef\xac\x81cial data produced\nby numerical models of Saturn (Sayanagi et al., 2010a), but this\nis ongoing.\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s poles have recently been imaged at high resolution\nby the Juno mission (Bolton et al., 2017; Orton et al., 2017),\nand Cassini has observed rich meteorology at Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s poles\n(Fig. 4.8); a comparison between the polar dynamics of both\natmospheres deserves closer attention. The ongoing Juno mission will provide further images of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s poles, which will\nallow better understanding of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s high-latitude dynamics.\nFollowing the 2009 impact on Jupiter (S\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.,\n2010; Hammel et al., 2010) there has been increasing interest\nin more systematic surveys of the planet in methane absorption\nbands where the debris left but an impact can be easily identi\xef\xac\x81ed and its evolution studied. Such observations are not key for\nunderstanding atmospheric dynamics, but are interesting if the\nimpacts left debris that can be used as tracers of stratospheric\nmotions.\nBetter measurements of the winds of Uranus and Neptune\nare certainly possible from the ground using large ground-based\ntelescopes with adaptive optics and using near-IR wavelengths\nin methane absorption bands that provide high contrast for\nbright cloud features. For Uranus especially, it is also important\nto use high signal-to-noise methods to reveal low-contrast cloud\nfeatures in regions of latitude and longitude away from major\nstorm regions, which have been undersampled by prior observations. As Uranus continues to move towards the northern hemi-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 102 \xe2\x80\x94 #124\n\n102\n\nS\xc3\xa1nchez-Lavega et al.\n\nsphere\xe2\x80\x99s summer solstice, we will be treated to better and better\nviews of the polar circulation of that planet, and the numerous\ncloud features that have appeared there will greatly facilitate\naccurate measurements. New measurement should also reveal\nwhether the large high-latitude north\xe2\x80\x93south asymmetry is seasonal or permanent, as large changes should occur in the polar\ncirculation if the former is true. To better de\xef\xac\x81ne meandering\njets, such as appear to exist on Neptune, and better understand\nthe dispersion of wind speeds on Neptune derived from recent\nground-based observations, as well as episodic storm systems\non Uranus, more time continuity in the observations would be\nextremely valuable, but the limited access provided by current\nobservatories that can achieve the required high spatial resolution makes this a dif\xef\xac\x81cult task.\n4.16.2 Launched and Approved Missions\nCassini will end its tour of Saturn with the Grand Finale in\nSeptember 2017, and Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016\n(Bolton, 2010; Bolton et al., 2017). The ESA mission JUICE\nwill orbit Jupiter and Ganymede in 2029 and later.\nJuno\xe2\x80\x99s primary mission is to determine the internal structure of the planet by measuring Doppler shifts in the X and\nKa bands used by the radio experiment. This has allowed measuring Juno\xe2\x80\x99s gravity \xef\xac\x81eld up to J10, including measurment of\nnonzero J3, J5, J7 and J9, which indicate north\xe2\x80\x93south asymmetries in the planet\xe2\x80\x99s gravity \xef\xac\x81eld (Bolton et al., 2017; Folkner\net al., 2017; Iess et al., 2018).\nThis will allow measuring Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s gravity moments up to at\nleast J12, which should help to settle the question of whether\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s zonal jets are deep or shallow (Hubbard, 1999; Kaspi\net al., 2010; Kaspi, 2013, 2018). This measurement is based on\nthe idea that if the jets on Jupiter penetrate deep enough, then\nthey should produce a measurable perturbation to the gravity\n\xef\xac\x81eld of the planet. More models connecting the jet structure\nto the gravity \xef\xac\x81elds are required to build a complete picture of\nthe relations between the wind and the resulting gravity \xef\xac\x81eld.\nJuno will also provide for the \xef\xac\x81rst time measurements of the\nodd harmonics of Jupiter (Kaspi, 2013), which, if they exist,\nwill provide information about north\xe2\x80\x93south asymmetries in the\ndeep wind structure, which should also help in constraining theories for the formation of the jets. Juno will also use microwave\nsounding to detect thermal radiation from deep below the visible cloud deck (to at least 100 bar, possibly to 1000 bar according to Bolton, 2010, Fig. 2). This will constrain the vertical\ntemperature pro\xef\xac\x81le and the water abundance at depth. There are\nno current plans to measure the deep water abundance on the\nother giant planets. How the temperature pro\xef\xac\x81le changes with\nlatitude will allow the atmospheric circulation and wind speeds\nto be constrained to much greater depths than was possible\nusing the Galileo probe (22 bar). There is a visible-wavelength\ncamera on the spacecraft, primarily for outreach and public\nengagement purposes, but it will also image Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s poles and\nlow latitudes. With a resolution of 15 km per pixel at closest approach, investigations of small-scale features should be\npossible.\nCassini\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Finale at Saturn includes 22 proximal orbits\n(polar orbits within the rings) with periapse altitudes of about\n5000 km, which will allow measurements of the gravity \xef\xac\x81eld\n\nup to J12. Similarly to the gravity measurements planned by\nJuno at Jupiter, this should allow resolution of the question of\nwhether the observed cloud-level jets are a thin atmospheric\nlayer phenomenon or re\xef\xac\x82ect deep cylindrical dynamics. These\nmeasurements by Cassini will also likely allow better constraints to be put on Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s rotation rate (Helled et al., 2015).\nIn combination with the known gravity constraints for Uranus\nand Neptune (Kaspi et al., 2013), these gravity measurements\nby Juno and Cassini should enable us to \xef\xac\x81nally narrow down the\npossible mechanisms driving zonal jets on giant planets within\nthe next few years.\nJUICE is to be launched in the early 2020s (Dougherty et al.,\n2011) and due to arrive in orbit around Jupiter in 2029, where\nit will primarily study Europa, Callisto and Ganymede, going\ninto orbit around Ganymede in late 2032. JUICE will combine\na large spectral range in its instrumentation with surveys of a\nwide range of space- and timescales afforded by the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s\norbit and proposed planetary tour, in particular detailed coverage of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s poles during the high-inclination phase. It will\nbe able to map the planet with global coverage at high resolution (\xe2\x88\xbctens of kilometers) over a long period, important for\nunderstanding jet variability, eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82uxes, the relative importance of barotropic and baroclinic processes, and the\nroles of storms, waves and other nonglobal phenomena. Using\nthe on-board Ultra Stable Oscillator, JUICE will be able to perform occultation measurements of Jupiter with unprecedented\naccuracy and global coverage. This will allow mapping of the\natmospheric winds and composition down to a level of several\nbar. Using high-resolution submillimeter spectroscopy it will be\npossible to measure winds in the stratosphere via direct Doppler\nmeasurements.\nWhile a Uranus mission has not yet been selected, there is\nconsiderable interest in such a venture. Such a mission would do\nthe same for those planets as for Jupiter and Saturn, moving our\nunderstanding of these planets\xe2\x80\x99 interior and atmosphere, along\nwith their satellites and rings, from exploration to characterization. This is particularly important due to the large numbers\nof Neptune-type exoplanets that have been discovered over the\npast several years, and for which Uranus and Neptune serve as\nprototypes.\nAs well as orbiters, a desired goal for future missions to the\ngiant planets is to put a probe into Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, as was\ndone with the Galileo probe for Jupiter. Like the Galileo probe,\nthis would focus on the chemical composition of the planet\nand noble gas inventories, fundamental for understanding Solar\nSystem formation, but also for atmospheric dynamics (Mousis\net al., 2014).\nIn terms of continuous monitoring of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s\natmospheric dynamics, there is interest in a dedicated small\nspace telescope to monitor the dynamics of these planets\xe2\x80\x99 atmospheres in the visible and near-infrared bands (Wong et al.,\n2009). In the absence of such a mission (or complementary to\nit), there are an increasing number of amateur observers who are\nable to produce regular observations resulting in a global monitoring of the giant planets\xe2\x80\x99 atmospheric activity (Hueso et al.,\n2010). Laboratory experiments and models of deep zonal \xef\xac\x82ows,\nsuch as those recently presented by Cabanes et al. (2017), will\nallow better understanding and simulation of the giant and icy\nplanets\xe2\x80\x99 zonal jets.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9781107043886book\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 2018/9/28 \xe2\x80\x94 17:02 \xe2\x80\x94 page 103 \xe2\x80\x94 #125\n\nGas Giants\n4.16.3 Modeling and Theory\nFuture work in numerical modeling is primarily focused on\nincluding processes relevant to the energy sources driving the\nzonal jets. In particular, these include small-scale convective\nand moist processes, and how these interact with the strati\xef\xac\x81ed\natmosphere. With more sophisticated models it should be possible to determine whether baroclinic instability can be driven\nby condensation-related temperature differences just above the\nwater condensation level, and whether this translates into the\njets and eddy momentum \xef\xac\x82uxes we see at the visible cloud\nlevels at higher altitude. More sophisticated cumulus cloud\nparameterizations will be required in such models with plausible triggering, heating, cooling, and moistening and drying\npro\xef\xac\x81les. Similarly, the role of moist convection has become\nan important topic of study (e.g., Zuchowski et al., 2009); in\nparticular, whether it can provide the requisite energy to drive\nthe jets by itself.\nConversely, the processes responsible for dissipation also\nremain poorly understood. How important is radiative heating\nand cooling in regulating the tropospheric jets in a model with\nrealistic heating pro\xef\xac\x81les? Magnetohydrodynamic drag is a dissipative process often included in models. Whether it puts an\neffective upper lid on the in\xef\xac\x82uence of deep convective turbulence such that \xe2\x80\x9cweather layer\xe2\x80\x9d models terminating at some\nmodest depth capture the processes directly relevant to maintaining the jets remains unknown.\nIn deeper models, is there a plausible (i.e. in a compressible atmosphere with realistic forcing and dissipation) deep\n\n103\n\nconvective cylinder explanation for observed giant planet jets?\nIf so, does it apply only to the equatorial jets on these planets or\nto higher-latitude jets as well?\nImprovements in computing power should make longer integration times more plausible in the future. The realism of current giant planet models is plagued by very long timescales\nthat are impractical to simulate on today\xe2\x80\x99s computers, as actual\nradiative and frictional timescales are much longer than are currently achievable. Substantially longer integration times would\ngo some way towards helping, although the timescales required\nare several orders of magnitude longer than is currently possible, particularly at depth, so this will not be a completely satisfactory solution.\nUnlike Earth modeling work, there is not necessarily an everincreasing drive towards greater horizontal resolution, although\nsome of the scales responsible for important processes such as\nmoist convective events are not yet fully resolved in global models. The vertical extent of three-dimensional \xe2\x80\x9cweather layer\xe2\x80\x9d\nmodels has been quite limited, typically limited to pressures\nbetween a few bar and a few mbar. A point will be reached\nwhere coupling between deep interior models and \xe2\x80\x9cweather\nlayer\xe2\x80\x9d models is required, or shallow models will attain a\nsuf\xef\xac\x81ciently deep domain such that the (arti\xef\xac\x81cial) distinction\nbetween deep and shallow models is no longer necessary. Juno\xe2\x80\x99s\nobservations of Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s interior structure and the depth of its\nweather layer will be important in determining which of these\ntwo paradigms should be followed in the future in modeling\nJupiter\xe2\x80\x99s zonal jets in particular.\n\n'
