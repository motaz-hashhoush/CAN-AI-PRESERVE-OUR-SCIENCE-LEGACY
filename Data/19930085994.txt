The data are given in\ntime-history form.\nINTRODUCTION\nA B-5A airplane has been made available to the NACA for\nloads investigation. The airplane has been instrumented with\ngages for measurements of the horizontal-tail, vertical-tall,\nloads and with additional instruments for measurement of the\ntion which occurs in the elevators, stabilizers, and fuselage\naerodynamic and inertia loads.\n\na tail-.\nstrain\nand wing\ndeformadue to\n\nSome immediate results obtained from the first flight, which was\nprimarily a pilot familiarization and instrument check flight, are\npresented in this paper. Loads on the horizontal tail, vertical tail,\nand wing and the structural deformation of stabilizers, elevators, and\nfuselage during right and left aileron rolls with rudder fixed at an\naltitude of 15,000 feet and a Mach number of 0.60 are presented in\ntime-history form. Time histories of a steady-flight run, two pull-ups,\nand a turn have previously been reported in reference 1.\nClassification Changed to\n\nGONPOENTIAL\nthorit\n\n\'ate\n\n[MAR 3i9M\n\nA\n\n2\t\n\nNACA RM 19128a\nSYMBOLS\n\nSymbols used in this paper are defined as follows:\nM\t\n\nMach number\n\nhp\t\n\npressure altitude\n\ng\t\n\nacceleration due to gravity, 32.2 feet per second per\nsecond\n\nUp loads on the horizontal stabilizers, elevators, and wing are\nconsidered positive. Positive loads on the vertical tail act to the\nright when looking forward. Other sign conventions used are defined\nin the figures.\n\nAPPARATUS AND TESTS\nThe airplane used for this Investigation is a B-45A (No. 7021).\nFigure 1 is a three-view drawing of the airplane showing the approximate locations of the load and deflection-measuring devices.\nStandard NACA photographic recording instruments are used to\nmeasure airspeed and altitude, rolling, pitching, and yawing velocities,\nsideslip angle, accelerations, control forces, and control positions.\nThe normal, transverse, and longitudinal accelerations are measured at\nthe airplane center of gravity and at fuselage station 71 14 (approximately the one-quarter chord of the horizontal tail). Measurements of\nnormal accelerations are also made at the midsemnlspan and tip of both\nhorizontal stabilizers.\nThe airspeed. boom is mounted at the left wing tip with the airspeed head approximately 1 chord length ahead of the leading edge.\nThe results of a flight calibration of the airspeed system for\nposition error and the analysis of available data for a similar\ninstallation Indicate that Mach number is correct to \xc2\xb10.01. The\nsideslip-angle recorder Is mounted on a boom extending approximately 1 chord length ahead of the right wing at the tip.\nElectrical resistance strain gages are installed on each spar\nfor shear and bending-moment measurements at stations 18 and 114 on\nthe horizontal and vertical tails, respectively, and at station 71 on\nthe wing. In addition, strain gages Installed, on the elevator and\nrudder hinges and torque tubes permit measurements of loads and torques\non these control surfaces. Twist bars installed in the horizontal\n\nNACA RM L9128a\t\n\n3\n\nstabilizers are used to measure the twist of the stabilizer niidsemispan and tip with respect to the root. Control\xe2\x80\x94position transmitters\nmounted at the root and tip of each elevator are used to measure the\nelevator twist. The transmitters are wired so as to give no response\nwhen the elevator is deflected without twisting. In flight, these\nmeasurements refer to twist of the elevator relative to the stabilizer.\nThe right and left elevators are warped at the tip 1.00 and 1.5 0 trailing\nedge up, respectively. To obtain total elevator twist, the elevator\nbuilt\xe2\x80\x94in twist must be added to the flight measurements. Additional\ncontrol\xe2\x80\x94position transmitters installed at the root of the elevator are\nused to measure the elevator position. The positions of the tabs, rudder,\nand ailerons are also measured by control\xe2\x80\x94position transmitters.\nAn optigraph mounted at the rear spar of the wing (fuselage\nstation 423) is used to record the vertical motion of small lights\npositioned in the fuselage at the approximate location of the front.\nand rear spare of the horizontal tail (fuselage stations 699 and 759).\nFrom this installation a time history of the structural deflection of\nthe rear portion of the fuselage can be obtained. A \xe2\x80\x94secon\xc3\xa2 time\npulse was used to correlate data from all recording instruments.\nThe data reported herein were obtained in right and left rolls at\nan altitude of 15,000 feet and M = 0.60.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe loads presented are aerodynamic loads. The estimated reading\naccuracies for the quantities measured are shown in table I.\nPresented in figure 2 are time histories of quantities measured.\nIn the right roll with the airplane in the clean condition at a Mach\nnumber of approximately 0.60 at 15,000 feet. Time histories of\nmeasurements made during a left roll at approximately the same altitude\nand Mach number are shown in figure 3. There was no appreciable variation in airspeed or altitude during either maneuver.\nIt can be seen from figure 2 that the horizontal\xe2\x80\x94tail\xe2\x80\x94load\ndissymmetry during a right roll is small, the greatest being 400 pounds\nmore down load on the left tail. The horizontal\xe2\x80\x94tail load varies\nbetween 2700 pounds and 3800 pounds in the down direction. Elevator\nloads are up and small and are less than 400 pounds.\nAt the start of the ran the airplane is in steady 2 0 left sideslip, and at the time of greatest vertical\xe2\x80\x94tail load the sideslip angle\n- CONFflNTIL\n\nNACA RM L9128a\n\n4\t\nA\t\n\n&\n\nis approximately zero. The maximum rate of roll is 0.14 6 radian per\n.\nsecond. The elevator angles are practically constant at 2.00 down\nduring the maneuver.\nThe vertical-tail load in the right roll is small. The fin load\nis 1420 pounds to the right at the start of the run with a load\nof 950 pounds to the left occurring at the time of zero sideslip. The\nrudder load. is to the left throughout the maneuver and is always less\nthan 200 pounds. The rudder angle Is zero.\nRight and left wing loads are presented. The differential rigging\nof the ailerons accounts in part for the unsymmetrical appearance of\nthe curves. Maximum total aileron deflection for this maneuver (sum of\nright and left deflections). is approximately 18 0 . The maximum total\naileron angle available is 450.\nRight and left stabilizers twisted approximately 0.20 nose down\nwhile the 0.16-inch tail-down bending of the fuselage at station 699\nwas reduced 0.03 inch during the roll. Measured twist of the left\nelevator is 0.750 trailing edge up while the twist measured on the\nright elevator is 1.5 0 trailing edge up. The difference in measured\ntwist of right and left elevators in flight may be attributed to the\nelevator built-in twist.\nFigure 3 shows that the greatest horizontal-tail-load dissymmetry\nin left roll is 750 pounds. At the same time the sideslip angle\nincreased from 1.70 left to 4.4 left. Total horizontal-tail loads\nincreased positively from 3800 pounds down to 2000 pounds down.\nElevator loads are less than 14.00 pounds in the up direction.\nThe maxiinuni rate of roll In the left roll is 0.56 radian per\nsecond. The elevator angles are constant at approximately 2.00 down.\nThe greatest total aileron angle is 230.\nIt is seen that the increment in fin load is 1600 pounds with a\nmaximum load to the right of 2000 pounds, which occurs at approximately\nthe time of peak sideslip. The rudder load is small and varies\nfrom 100 pounds to the left to 40 pounds to the right. The rudder\nangle is zero.\nThe right and left wing loads are approximately symmetrical about\na mean which follows the trend of the center-of-gravity normalacceleration curve. Stabilizer and elevator twists and fuselage defleotion are similar to those shown in figure 2. This similarity is to be\nexpected since horizontal-tail loads in both right and left rolls were\nfound to be comparable.\n\ncwWIfrn4,\n\nNACA RM L9128a \t\n\n5\n\nThe results obtained indicate that loads on the fin and rudder of\nthe test airplane are small during right and left aileron rolls with\nrudder fixed at M = 0.60 and an altitude of 15,000 feet. The increment in sideslip angle of 2.70 was obtained using a total aileron\ndeflection of approximately one\xe2\x80\x94half the available aileron travel. The\ngreatest load dissymmetry on the horizontal tail occurred during the\nleft roll where the right tail carried 75 0 pounds more down load, than\nthe left.\n\nLangley Aeronautical Laboratory\nNational Advisory Comniittee for Aeronautics\nLangley Air Force Base, Va.\n\n1.
