In recent decades, centralized aeronautics has become a mature discipline, which raises questions concerning the future aviation innovation frontiers. Three transformational aviation capabilities, bounded together by the development of a Free Flight airspace management system, have the potential to transform 21st Century society as profoundly as civil aviation transformed the 20th Century. These mobility breakthroughs will re-establish environmental sustainable centralized aviation, while opening up latent markets for civil distributed sensing and on-demand rural and regional transportation. Of these three transformations, on-demand aviation has the potential to have the largest market and productivity improvement to society. The information system revolution over the past 20 years shows that vehicles lead, and the interconnecting infrastructure to make them more effective follows; that is, unless on-demand aircraft are pioneered, a distributed Air Traffic Control system will likely never be established. There is no single technology long-pole that will enable on-demand vehicle solutions. However, fully digital aircraft that include electric propulsion has the potential to be a multi-disciplinary initiator of solid state technologies that can provide order of magnitude improvements in the ease of use, safety/reliability, community and environmental friendliness, and affordability.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100033501, "endDate": "2010-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "30f18cf8d3d243a2867d730adb03de36", "id": "50119c98a8474b9f8054389ad82c5a82"}], "name": "10th AIAA Aviation Technology, Integration, and Operations (ATIO) Conference", "location": "Fort Worth, TX", "id": "30f18cf8d3d243a2867d730adb03de36", "startDate": "2010-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100033501, "id": "e271e913b61b49509cab73ce0cad9031", "publicationDate": "2010-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100033501.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100033501/downloads/20100033501.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100033501/downloads/20100033501.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100033501/downloads/20100033501.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
