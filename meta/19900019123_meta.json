However, the efforts to privately finance these seven projects did not increase the commercial sector's involvement in space to the extent desired. The General Accounting Office (GAO) determined that the projects selected were not a fair test of the potential of increasing commercial investment in space at an acceptable cost to the government, primarily because the projects were not properly screened. That is, neither their suitability for commercialization nor the economic consequences of seeking private financing for them were adequately evaluated before selection. Evaluations and market tests done after selection showed that most of the projects were not viable candidates for private financing. GAO concluded that projects should not be removed from NASA's budget for commercial development until after careful screening has been done to determine whether adequate commercial demand exists, development risks are commercially acceptable and private financing is found or judged to be highly likely, and the cost effectiveness of such a decision is acceptable. Premature removal of projects from NASA's budget ultimately can cause project delays and increased costs when unsuccessful commercialization candidates must be returned to the budget. NASA also needs to ensure appropriate comparisons of government and private financing options for future commercialization projects.", "title": "Space Projects: Improvements Needed in Selecting Future Projects for Private Financing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900019123, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900019123, "id": "8d950d7bc1a64594836e8f8de5bbcf85", "publicationDate": "1990-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900019123.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900019123/downloads/19900019123.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900019123/downloads/19900019123.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900019123/downloads/19900019123.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
