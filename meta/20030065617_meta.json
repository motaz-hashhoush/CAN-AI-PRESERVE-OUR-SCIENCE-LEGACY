Through planned upgrades and spiral development, it is also capable of satisfying the Nation's evolving space transportation requirements and enabling the national vision for human space flight. The OSP System, formulated through rigorous requirements definition and decomposition, consists of spacecraft and launch vehicle flight elements, ground processing facilities and existing transportation, launch complex, range, mission control, weather, navigation, communication and tracking infrastructure. The concept of operations, including procurement, mission planning, launch preparation, launch and mission operations and vehicle maintenance, repair and turnaround, is structured to maximize flexibility and mission availability and minimize program life cycle cost. The approach to human rating and crew safety utilizes simplicity, performance margin, redundancy, abort modes and escape modes to mitigate credible hazards that cannot be designed out of the system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030065617, "endDate": "2003-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition", "location": "Dayton, OH", "id": "e619c66cf40b403a9b65e920812009ea", "startDate": "2003-07-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030065617, "id": "6f87aae51c56463aabccb502b450ce5a", "publicationDate": "2003-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030065617.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030065617/downloads/20030065617.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030065617/downloads/20030065617.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030065617/downloads/20030065617.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
