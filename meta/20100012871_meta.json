Improper requirements generation, undocumented user expectations, conflicting design decisions, and anticipated / unanticipated world states are representative of these volatility factors. Combined, these volatility factors can increase programmatic risk and adversely affect successful system development. This paper proposes that a Bayesian Network can be used to support reasonable judgments concerning the most likely sources and types of requirements volatility a developing system will experience prior to starting development and by doing so it is possible to predict the level of requirements volatility the system will experience over its lifecycle. This assessment offers valuable insight to the system's developers, particularly by providing a starting point for risk mitigation planning and execution.", "title": "Assessing Requirements Volatility and Risk Using Bayesian Networks", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T22:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20100012871, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Russell, Michael S."}, "organization": {"name": "Booz-Allen and Hamilton Inc.", "location": "United States"}}, "id": "43302d0926424618a76dd996be402aca"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20100012871, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100012871, "id": "6cdf0b70093c4405b417a1c925586b72", "publicationName": "Selected Papers Presented at MODSIM World 2009 Conference and Expo", "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100012837, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Selected Papers Presented at MODSIM World 2009 Conference and Expo", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100012871.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100012871/downloads/20100012871.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100012871/downloads/20100012871.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100012871/downloads/20100012871.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
