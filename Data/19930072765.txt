We have\nawakened a national interest in the importance of high quality\nand productivit y in all aspect ; of work, and we have\nemphasized that quality and productivit y improvements will\ndrive America\'s abilitv to com p ete successfull y in the\nL\nincreasingly competitive world market. To further emphasize\nquality, we will hold our sixth annual conference during\nOctober, which is National Quality Month, and we will\nannounce the recipient or recipients of the NASA Excellence\niwward for Quality and Productivit y at the conference.\nThe theme of the Fifth Annual NASA/Contractors\nConference, "Qualit y - A Commitment to the Future," echoes\nare ideal that is shared by NASA and contractors alike. This\nsummary report highlights the key points discussed at the\nconference. It is our hope that it will be useful to the\nrecipients and serve to strengthen their commitment to\nquality, productivit y , a, , d excellence.\nI commend the NASA.\'contractor team on its diligent efforts\ntoward meeting those goals, for NASA and for America.\n\nmes C. Fletcher\n\nISO NASA\'s Commitment to Qi\n1.1 Introduction\nDale D. Myers, Deputy Administrator,\nNASA Headquarters\nWhile quality has always been a hallmark of NASA\'s\noperation, it assumed new significance after the Challenger accident. Several significant organizational\nchanges were instituted at that point to ensure optimum conditions for all aspects of quality control. At\npresent George Rodney, Associate Administrator for\nSafety, Reliability, Maintainability and Quality Assurance, reports independently, directly to the Administrator. Increased emphasis is placed on strategic\nplanning, an activity that is led by Richard Reeves,\nDirectoi of Planning. New technical expertise has\nbeen brought into the various NASA centers, and at\nNASA Headquarters the Mana.-emcnt Council is\ntaking a harder look at key issues and costs.\nA very beneficial change was made in flight readiness\nreviews. In the past such reviews were often too\nremote, not providing direct contact with personnel\nactually involved inthe work. In-person-reviews now\nallow increased communication and a much fuller understanding of pertinent issues. Two other areas of\ncommunication are newly stressed; (1) Cross communication between the centers, and (2) communication up and down the organization with civil service\nand contractors. The following presentations describe\nin greater detail the key elements of this new emphasis\non quality and communication.\n\n1.2 Strategic and\nLong-Range Planning\nRichard A. Reeves, Director of Planning,\nNASA Headquarters\nStrategic and long-range planning are vital to ensuring that NASA maintains its tradition of high-quality\nproducts. Such planning is a complex, detailed\n\nprocess that involves input from the entire organization and that must be fully integrated with the Quality\nand Productivity Improvement Program. Certainly\nthe direction of the agency is much more clearly\ndefined than one would believe from reports carried\nby the media. A number of very sound plans are in\nplace, they are well documented, and detailed\nprograms are being evolved from them. In many ways\nthe NASA planning activity is a model one, containing\na number of unique features and geared to both nearfuture and far-future goals. There is a growing integration among the various plans, including center\nplans, which support our technological base and related infrastructure. The intention is to have plans that\nare elastic enough to allow for necessary near-term adjustments without compromising basic long-term\ngoals.\nAlthough criticisms of NASA planning may be overstated, they indicate that there is still work to be done\nin the planning area, a large part of which is communication of our vision. In addition to the many established individual plans, we need to develop a comprehensive overall plan, and we need to clearly define\nthe relationships between the plans. Through such a\ncomprehensive approach, our long-term direction can\nbe effectively communicated. In the past, plans have\nbeen developed by organizational elements, resulting\nin many separate plans. These will soon be combined\nin an Integrated Planning Summary. We have an advantage in that our basic goals and objectives have\nbeen in place for some time, they have stood the test\nof time, and they continue to be valid at this point. Our\nchief task is now to convey them clearly to the policy\nmakers, the media, and the public.\nNASA\'s most recent planning activities have drawn\nupon many resources, including Sally Ride\'s study and\nthe input of some talented new personnel. Newcomers\nwant to be part of the evolving culture, and they are\nuseful for testing the validity of NASA\'s vision. The\nplanning activity will evolve through consensus, first\nwith NASA management, and then with the Administration. When the comprehensive plan is complete, major themes will be identified and theme targets established to define the best way to achieve an\nintegrated overall approach.\nThe teaming concept is strong at NASA Headquarters. It is an essential part of strategic and longterm planning, both: in terms of drawing upon the\n\ni\n{1\nL\n\nsons learned, and engineering judgment. These have\nserved us well, but the projects ahead such as the Space\nStation, will make new demands on our risk assessment\ncapabilities. In the future we will undoubtedly make\ngreater use of trend analysis, which is a useful tool, although it cannot replace sound engineering judgment.\nAlso, we will need to gear our system so that the right\nproblems are brought to the attention of the right level\nof management. Great emphasis was placed on this\nreporting system as we worked to achieve a safe return\nto shuttle flight; now that has been realized, and we\nmust institute a long-term program that will meet the\nneeds of the many, very expensive, "one-shot"\nprograms scheduled fr,- the near future.\nThe success of any safety and reliability effort begins\nwith the initial phases of a project, with obtaining the\noptimum design and engineering. But even in the\npresence of these elements, we cannot become complacent and when a failure occurs, the responsibility\nmust always be borne in part by SRM&QA because it\nshows a deficiency in our process. In SRM&QA we\nrealize many mutual benefits by working closely with\ncontractors. Certainly we depend on industry to make\ncritical upgrades so that together we can realize the ultimate benefit to the work force - the experience of the\nquality ethic.\nQuality and productivity enhancement is not easily\nprescribed; it is not merely a buzz word or slogan, and\nit is not realized in a series of uniform systems. It is a\nperspective that must be flexible and pervasive, continually adjusting to the requirements of a rapidly\nevolving technology. In order to be first, we must\nachieve excellence in fact and in perception.\n\nresources of the entire work force and of addressing\nthe needs and talents of civil service and contractor\nemployees.\n\n1.3 Quality Commitment\nGeorge A. Rodney, Associate Administrator\n,for Safety, Reliability, Maintainability and\nQuality Assurance, NASA Headquarters\nThe conference theme, "Quality - A Commitment to\nthe Future," is a challenge both as a matter of personal\nphilosophy and as it translates into leadership. At\nNASA, quality culture must extend tothe full range of\noperations, including hardware and software development, services, and strategic planning. All phases of\nthe agency\'s operation must be geared to continuous\nimprovement in light of a single prime consideration,\nmeeting the user\'s requirements.\nThis objective is the basis upon which the NASA Ofrice of Safety, Reliability, Maintainability and Qual\'.ty\nAssurance (SRM&QA) operates. To achieve it,\nSRM&QA must have a line of direct access to\nmanagement, must operate as a tool of a given\nprogram (i.e., be useful to the program), and must be\nsupported by adequate resources.\nAfter the Challenger accident, these elements\nreceived a great deal of attention. However, now that\nwe have returned successfully to shuttle flight, we can\nexpect a drgree of complacency to build up.\nSRM&QA must guard against such complacency by\nclearly identifying program risks and making them\nvisible at the appropriate levels of management. Part\nof doing this involves long-term build-up of the technical stature of SRM&QA through recruitment of new\ntalent. It is gratifying to see an increasing number of\nyoung and senior engineers recognize the tremendous\nchallenges available in SRM&QA because we are very\ndependent upon a dedicated work force that is fully\ncommitted to quality.\nQuality assurance of hardware is an area of special\nconcern, particularly in regard to materials certification. These days programs are more sophisticated and\nwe need sophisticated support technology to certify\nhardware. We know how to assess metallics, but a\ngreat deal remains to be learned about non-metallics.\nTraditionally we have relied upon qualitative assessment, but we now need to develop a method for making\na quantitative assessment of risk. In the past we have\ndepended on a multi-series of technical reviews, les-\n\n1.4 Risk Management\nTames R. Thompson, Jr., Director, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center\nThese are good times at NASA when, after having\nreturned successfully to shuttle flight, we are beginning\nto make a detailed analysis of the data that were\nbrought back and plan for future flights. It is also a time\nto reflect over the last 21/2 years and ask ourselves what\nactions have added value to our programs. Certainly\nin the future we cannot react as we did to the Challenger accident and continue to maintain the program.\nThe recent downtime was extremely useful for making\ncorrections, but with improved risk management we\nshould not have to experience another such lapse in\n\n2\n\nshuttle flights. Optimum risk management is essential\nbecause our missions arc very dependent upon how it\n\nis handled, especially in the critical area of propulsion\nin which \'Hl% of the risk exists. Risk can never be\neliminated, but we must develop the best possible s y stem to identif y it, and we MUSS further formaliic the infrastructure of\'risk management. A number of\'%ery cffccli%e measures have been instituted over the past"- I",\nyears to maximize Our risk management, but Ac need\nto continue our efforts to address the evolving tcchnology of the next 20 years of shuttle flights. During this\nspan of time, we will be working with new people and\nthere may be some loss of corporate memor y ; we need\na s y stcrn of risk management that will enable those of\nus wk ho arc presently in ,.A cd and those who will be in%ohed \'Al the future to work smarter.\nThe magnitude of the risk management task can be\ndescribed in part b y projecting the occurrence of topprionly risks, which are referred to as Criticalit y 1\nRisks. Based on our cxpct lend to date, we can es-\n\ntimate that in the next 20 y cars of shuttle (light we will\n\nhe called upon to address tj nalf million Criticalit y 1\nRisks. Our goal is to achic%c 99"; reliahi l it y :a shuttle\nflights, at present we arc at\'W"t reliability, which is\ngood, but it has to be impro%cd.\nIn planning ahead for risk management, we must expect that we will be greatly affected by funding constraints. Resources will be increasingly limited, and\nthe loss of a shuttle represents, in addition to the immeasurable loss of human live\xc2\xad an enormous loss of\nsophisticated equipment, worth approximatel y $6 to\n$7 billion. Hence, the public will rightfully expect that\nNASA demonstrate excellence in all aspects of risk\nmanagement. It should he made clear to everyone that\nrisk cannot be eliminated, but that it can be effccti%cIv managed.\nSpccial attention should be given to risk. management\nin areas such as those for which there is a history of\nproblems because very few in-flight failures occur\nwithout any prior indication of difficulties. Attention\nmust also be given to areas in which nondcstructi%e\ntesting is lacking, some of which will invoke the\ndevelopment of new, risk assessment technology.\n(lose attention to risk management of the main\npropulsion system is essential because of its inherent\npotential hazards. We have the people in pla:c lr\nhandle the job. but the process controls and the risk\nassessment technology must be further developed.\nMuch of this development should not be %cry. costly,\nbut it must occur soon, certainl y before the launch of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. The focus is on the future. This is a time to reexamine our approaches,\nmake appropriate changes, and build upon what we\nhave accomplished so far.\n\nNASA Depurn\' Administrator Dale I).

The cells were\nconceived of and equipped by NASA and are staffed\nby civil service personnel and engineers and technicians representing prime contractors. Most of the\nproductivity enhancement cells are involved with\ndevelopmental work pertaining to the External Tank,\nSolid Rocket boosters, and the main engine of the\nshuttle. The cells arc supported by CAD/CAM,\nkinematic simulation, optical and tactile sensing\ndevices development, advanced robotic processing\ndevelopment, high heat flux testing,\nhydroproof/hydroburst analysis, and kinematic algorithm down-loading capabilities.\nFunding for the effort is not included in the Science\nand Engineering Directorate budget but is obtained\nfrom the Space Shuttle Project Offices on a competitive,return-on-investmentbasis. For each dollar spent\nin the facility, 15 dollars are returned from cost savings,\ncost avoidances, and reduced maintenance costs. An\nexample of the teamwork established in this effort is\nseen in the development of the backup repair for the\nshuttle vent valve leak at the PEF, which involved a\nteam of 150 people from NASA, Rocketdyne, Martin\nMarietta, and USBI.\nThe facility has resulted in significant technology accomplishments as well as substantial benefits of teamwork and enhanced working relationships.\n\n2.1.1 Managing in Partnership\nRichard A. Reeves, Director of Planning,\nNASA Headquarters\nThe recent successful shuttle flight is indeed a tribute\nto the working partnership of NASA and its contractors. In previous NASA/Contractors conferences the\nimportance of this partnership : has been discussed, and\ncertainly we have made some good strides in working\ntogether. But the time has come to move from partnership rhetoric to partnership reality, a part of which is\nmutually addressing some of the remaining barriers to\nteamwork. An example of such a barrier is the archaic\ncivil service/contractor relationship controlled by law\nand regulation. This is a sensitive issue and not easily\nresolved; however, I believe there are steps that would\nfacilitate a stronger partnership between the two\ngroups. In the long term, we must seek modifications\nof the Space Act to eliminate artificial boundaries between civil servants and contractors. In the near-term,\nwe should explore devices such as the Contractor\nCouncil that is presently op :rating at Ames Research\nCenter, which could be used as a model for groups in\nother areas to foster positive civil service/contractor\nrelationships. Third, a creative brochure should be\ndeveloped along the lines of one produced by the\nAmes Research Center to provide a set of practical\nguidefi=s and suggestions (do\'s and don\'t\'s) for civil\nservice and contractor personnel.\n\n2.13 Building a NASA/Contractor\nTeam for Long Term Mission\nSupport\n\n2.1.2 Productivity Enhancement:\nA NASA/Contractor Team\nEffort\n\nMichael E. Plett, Program Manager SEAS,\nSystem Sciences Division, Computer\nSciences Corporation\n\nRichard R. Holmes, Supervisor,\nExperimental Manufacturing Techniques,\n\nThe recent successful shuttle mission is certainly\nmost gratifying; but a great deal of work remains to\nbuild a NASA/contractor team for long-term mission\n\n5\n\nr\n\nThe selection of a compatible teaming partner is vital\nto the success of a contractor/contractor alliance.\nOnce a workable team is formed, there will be advantages in the proposal preparation as well as in the\nlater stages of contract satisfaction. A good teaming\nrelationship will be at risk if an organization becomes\nallied with a company with which it is competing elsewhere at the same time. Other impediments to successful teaming are an unsatisfactory interface system\nand added layers of management with accompanying\nadded costs. A final and overriding prerequisite to\nteaming is that it must make sense to the customer.\nThe success of a contractor/contractor team basically\nhinges on a single condition: Unity of purpose.\n\nsupport. We cannot succeed without one another.\nThe problems inherent in building a NASA/contractorteam stem from the fact that the relationships tend\nto be adversarial. Recent increased administrative\noversight has resulted in increased overhead costs. Effects of this increased oversight are pervasive; they extend beyond the administrative area and lead to significant barriers in technical interfaces. Another\nproblem exists in the fact that support contracts can be\ndetrimental to productivity. They frequently inhibit\ninnovation by mandating a day-by-day direction that\nimplies lack of trust in the contractor. A part of this\nresults from insufficient long-term planning that clearly identifies what a contractor may and may not do and\nwhat is ultimately expected of him. Government and\ncontractor people have equal talent; advantage must\nbe taken of the productive ideas from both groups, or\nthe program will suffer.\nObviously there is a need for mutualtrust and respect\nupon which a team can operate with free exchange of\ninformation and a willingness to consider new ideas.\nThree major areas affect such team building: (1) Personal interactions - contractor management must be\nencouraged to express their concerns o penly; possibly they may be enabled to do so through an award fee\nbased on problem disclosure and resolution; personel\ninteractions might also be enhanced by opportunities\nfor social interaction (e.g., working lunches, NASAsponsored events); (2) The task order environment a more direct approach in this area is needed; (3)\nChanges in the award fee policy - contractors become\ndefensive to protect their fees; if it is perceived that\npersonal service is favored over teamwork, contractors\nbegin to distrust NASA. We all recognize that the administration of award fees is costly, but high awards\nmust be attainable.\nIn summary, if contractors are willing to be more candid with NASA and if NASA is willing to do less policing of contractors, we will have made a very significant\nstep toward achieving teamwork.\n\n2.2.2 Space\n\nShuttle\n\nSafe\n\nEnough or\n\nToo Safe\nAllan J. McDonald, Vtce President,\nEngineering, Morton Thiokol\nThe redesign of the field joint was a team effort in\nwhich Marshall Space Flight Center and Morton\nThiokol teams worked in parallel with the Marshall\nteam located in Utah. Based on this parallel activity,\nthe best elements of each redesign were adopted. It is\ninteresting to note that the redesign had five to six\ntimes more testing than the original design and was accomplished in half the time. Testing took place both\nat Utah and Huntsville on a test article that was shown\nto produce the same results as those recorded for the\nChallenger. Subcontractors were brought in to\nprovide expertise in this effort in which old hardware\nwas modified and new items (such as a joint heater)\nwere added. The J-joint insulation design successfully prevented gas and water from passing through the\ninsulation on STS-26. This redesign has increased the\noverall reliability of the field joint by a factor of 7000.\nIn regard to the redesign, an item of interest and possible concern is that the cost of the new O-rings increased by a factor of 10 because of added quality\nchecks (x-r ays went from 0 to 100 percent, 1500 laser\nmicrometer measurements as opposed to 15 handheld micrometer measurements formerly made, and\nnewly instituted resiliency and physical property testing on every O-ring). However, because of the\nredesign, these new O-rings will probably never come\ninto contact with hot gas. Is this too much safety? At\nthis point the shuttle program must reassess the\nreliability to determine at what point we are over-inspecting the hardware. The point at which we can\n\n2.2 Contractor/Contractor\nTeaming\n2.2.1 Success in Team Approach\nFrancis L. Shill, lice President, Aerospace\nDivision, Pan Am World Services, Inc.\n\n6\n\nM1\n\nback off has yet to be decided. It is clear that concerted teaming efforts can makesubstantial accomplishments. However, they will reduce the cost\ncompetitiveness of the shuttle if we do not eliminate\nunnecessary reliability. Quality by design is always a\nbetter approach than quality by inspection.\n\n2.3 Space Station Teaming\n23.1 The Space Station Freedom\nAssociate Contractor\nAgreement\n\n2.23 Ames Contractor Council A Success in Contractor\nTeaming\n\nJames M. Sisson, Deputy Director, Space\nStation Freedom Program\nThe Space Station Freedom Associate Contractor\nAgreement structure was initiated to simplify the\nprogram integration process. With a multitude of\nmanagement interfaces between government and contractors, a set of contractor-to-contractor agreements\nwill greatly facilitate communication of information as\nweli as hardware/software deliveries among the\ndevelopment contractors, while maintaining governmentvisibility into this process. These agreements will\ntake the form of negotiated and definitized contract\nmodifications with an appropriate fee structure and\nperformance evaluation criteria. Emphasis will be\nupon work package commonality, with provision for\nuniqueness where deemed desirable. The chief\nbenefits are cost avoidance, better use of resources, increased efficiency, and reduced program risks.\n\nLibby E. Party, Site Manager, Bionetics\nCorporation\nFor the past 1 1 /2 years the Ames Research Center\nContractor Council has brought Ames contractor representatives together to solve common problems and\nproduce mutual benefits. It is geared to excellence in\nperformance and to quality in products and services.\nIt receives strong support from Center management\nand profits from participation of the Ames Productivity Focal Point who is a member of the group. The\ngroup, limited to on-site contractors, represents 55%\nof all Ames contractor employees, with one vote allowed for each contractor. It meets every other week\nfor 1 1 /2 hours with contractor companies paying for\ntheir employees\' Council participation. Every six\nmonths the Council chairmanship is rotated.\nThe projects undertaken by the Council include identifying roadblocks to teaming, improving the new\nemployee orientation, developing an Ames services\nhandbook, including contractor yellow pages in the\nAmes telephone book, and a Productivity Improvement and Quality Enhancement (PIQE) plan geared\nto contractor employees. The Council\'s goals for 1989\nare to develop a centralized contractor job openings\nlist, an integrated employee suggestion program, and\nto make the Ames Employee Assistance Program\navailable to contractors. The Ames Contractor Council has been a significant force in the development of\nteam spirit at the Center.\n\n2.3.2 Program Support Contract\nTeaming/Integration\nFrederick W. Raise. President, Space Station\nvision, Grumman\nProgram Support Di\nCorporation\nThe Program Support Contract (PSC) is ateam comprised of Grumman Corporation as prime contractor\nwith teammates Ford Aerospace, Booz-Allen and\nHamilton, Wyle Laboratories, Inc., Barrios Technology, Inc., and LSAT. The team was formed on the\nbasis of a capabilities review designed to bring\ntogether the best match of strengths. Roles and\nresponsibilities were carefully assigned to allow clear\naccountability, a forum through which each company\ncould express its mission and accomplishments, and\nelimination of an added overhead burden of tiered_\ndown award fee evaluation s. The NASA Award Fee\nEvaluation is used for all the organizations, and the\n\n7\n\nteam has contracted to share a common award fee\npool, which enhances teamwork and mutual support.\nThe team operates as a seamless organization, identified as the Program Support Contractor rather than\na group of individual companies. This is exemplified\nin the fact that a common benefit package was once\nconsidered, although itwas not enacted because no increase in value would have been realized. All routine\nfunctions and meetings involve the entire team, including staff meetings, Horizontal Integration Meetings,\nFireside Chats, and an annual picnic. There is one\nnewsletter and a standard PSC viewgraph format and\nstationery. The telephone directory makes no individual company identification. Award programs are\napplied to the entire team and all members use the\nsame NASA-PSC badge. The only company-unique\nfunction is personnel administration. The teaming effort has resulted in a strong sense of mission, high\nmorale, and performance excellence.\n\ntegrable and testable, and it must meet Freedom\'s requirements. The SSE must be available early enough\nto support the work package contractors as they come\non board, and an interim system is required 30 days\nafter the contract start. Teamwork from four contractors was required to provide a 75% system at the 30day time frame. In building this system, both linkage\nand autonomy were important considerations.\nThe key element of long-.haul teamwork depends on\ntrust relationships rather than legalities. Important\nelements of building the SSE team were development\nof an integrated management team, a single badging\nsystem, and equal access to equipment and facilities.\nAt Lockheed the performance score Bows down to all\nsubcontractors except one. Teaming has made it possible for many companies to be involved in and contribute to NASA activities. It provides a diversified\nresource base, with long-term benefits to both NASA\nand its contractors.\n\n2.3.3 The SSE: Getting a\n\n23.4 Technical and Management\nInformation System (TABS)\nTeaming/Integration\n\nTechnological Head Start\nthrough Teaming\n\nR.

This way everyone shares the responsibility\nfor contributing to productivity improvement.\nRocketdyne has involved its total work force, all\nlevels and all functions, in the commitment to excellence. The program has included a formalized system\nof goal setting and monitoring for each person on the\nexecutive staff, expanded training and recognition\nprograms, PIQE teams that were tasked with implementing change, and a long-term program for\nautomation and computer integration of all functions.\nAmong numerous improvements, the institution of\nCAD/CAM, robotic welding, and on-machine inspections have been significant in achieving Rocketdyne\'s\nquality goals. A Supplier Prcduct Integrity Assessment was introduced as a rigorous review of supplier\nfacilities, as well as a supplier rating system and\nmethod of information sharing with suppliers. The\nreview is actually multi-functional, often including\nRocketdyne\'s customers; it is hardware-oriented and\nis conducted "on the floor." It is gratifying that the\nprogram results in higher quality products, reduced\ncosts, enhanced data access and management controls, and improved communication both internally\nand with outside organizations.\n\n3.1 NASA Excellence Award\n- Hardware\n3.1.1 Introduction\nRichard M. Davis, Corporate Tice President\nand President, Manned Spuce Systems,\nMartin Marietta Corporation\nLess than two weeks ago, America and the world witnessed the most compelling reason to incorporate excellence into every aspect of work at NASA; the launch\nof the Discovery and America\'s return to manned\nspace flight. However, this recent success should not\ndull the realization that without a process or method\nfor reviewing the way we do business, we can invite\ncomplacency and the chance for failure.\nThe NASA Excellence Award provides a process to\nassess our products and services and an opportunity\nfor improvement, and there is always room for improvement. The companies that have been selected as\nfinalists in this award process are those companies that\nstrive to achieve the goals of excellence, accomplishment, and mission success.\n\n3.1.3 Sustaining Excellence During\nReorganization\n\n3.1.2 The Total Effort to Achieve\nExcellence\n\nPeter L. Kujawski, General Manager,\nScience and Application Programs, General\nElectric Company\n\nRichard Schwartz, President, Rocketdyne\nDivision, Rockwell International\nCorporation\n\nWhen General Electric and RCA were merged,\nmany challenges were met in combining two different\nmarkets and two different work cultures. The resulting reorganization was made along product lines so the\nfunctional organizations formed the basis of the\nmerger.\nBoth GE and RCA had policies that strongly emphasized quality, and the essence of these was retained\n\nAn organization can only achieve excellence in all\nphases of operation if key management is firmly committed to quality performance and products. At\nRocketdyne, vivid demonstrations, such as stopping\nproduction lines to check quality, have conveyed this\nmanagement message to employees. However, com-\n\n11\n\nteams have been effectively employed by all division\norganizations and have demonstrated significant dollar savings.\nThe challenge of resuming productuon of a Space\nShuttle Orbiter after a period of minimum activity has\nalso been addressed by special management actions.\nManufacturinglTesl Readiness Reviews focus on the\npreparations in place as specific work milestones are\napproached. These efforts have prevented problems\nby assuring that facilities, equipment, work instructions and people fare ready for the work to be done.\nAn essential part of the process is acknowledgment\nof accomplishments. Employee recognition takes\nmany forms, from verbal praise and awards to\nAstronaut presentations and the prestigious Manned\nFlight Awareness Honoree Award. These provide the\npositive feedback that encourages continued, increased participation and builds the icam spirit that\nmakes the Space Shuttle Orbiter possible.\n\nas a single, simple quality policy. The success of the\nmerger was measured in terms of production (shop\ndefects declined steadily) and interfaces (valuable\nrelationships with suppliers were maintained). A\nmanagement approach to productivity was developed\nwith asystem of establishing goals in view of maintaining a competitive position in the marketplace.\nEmphasis was placed upon management training,\nand quality and productivity was emphasized in\nmaterial distributed from the division staff. A degree\nof leverage was achieved by merging corporate resources so that costs to the customer decreased. Attention\nwas given to sustaining programs for employee motivation, a part of which involved having NASA speak\ndirectly to the employees on its quality and productivity goals. Noontime briefings by management,\nprovision of fitness facilities, open houses at each site,\nshuttle buses between locations, and awards programs\nwere all effective in maintaining a high level of\nemployee motivation during the reorganization.\n\n3.2 NASA Excellence Award\n- Support Services/Launch\nProcessing\n\nMA STSD Team Excellence Pays\nOff\t\n\nSeymour Z. Rubenstein, President, Space\nTransportation Systems Division, Rockwell\nInternational Corporation\n\n3.2.1 Introduction\n\nRockwell International\'s Space Transportation Systems Division is meeting the challenge of maintaining\nhigh quality and reducing costs by involving personnel in a program geared to team excellence. This\nprogram is designed to support the diversity of\nRockwell\'s business activity, and it takes a balanced\napproach toward excellence, seeking to estabish a center of shared values. It focuses on three basic areas;\nmanagement involvement, implementation of actions,\nand acknowledgment of participants. Management\ntakes the lead in initiatives to produce better products\nand lower costs. Regular reviews are essential in order\nto measure progress being made in all areas of the organization.\nTrue success of a quality mprovement effort involves\nparticipation of the entire organization. At STSD, opportunities are provided for all emplo yees to contribute as individuals or teams in identifying-and implementing change to improve operations. Especially\neffective are the Employee Action Teams, people\nfrom a work unit trained in the group problem solving\nprocess, who examine their own processes and\nproduct for better ways of doing business. These\n\nI.

Since\nStennis is a Center whose primary product is service,\nits measure of excellence is in its people. The Quality\nand Productivity Improvement Program is directed\ntoward technology innovation, management initiatives, and employee motivation and recognition. One\nimportant element of the technology innovation effrots\nat Stennis is development of techniques for monitoring the health of a rocket engine during test firing.\nWork in this area not only provides increased\nreliability for shuttle missions, but has resulted in exciting spinoff advances in contaminant detection.\nRecent management initiatives have included sponsorship of management work retreats, strategic planning, and the inclusion of a quality representative on\nthe Performance Evaluation Board of major contracts.\nEmployee teamwork and motivation are fostered\nthrough a variety of interdisciplinary teams. These\n\n12\n\n3.23 LESC\'s Corporate Culture\nEmpowers Excellence\n\nteams, some of which have a combined government/contractor membership. allow personel with\nvarious skills to pool resources in developing a project\nform concept to the implementation stage. Numerous\nimprovements have been implemented at the Center\nthorough the teams. Training for performace enhancement has been done utilizing the Investment Excellence Series and has been given to approximately 300\nemployees. Stennis also has an active recognition\nprogram and awards are given to those who make Significant contributions in cost savings and improved\nwork processes.\nWe believe that excellence is possible in support services and that excellence is in the people who perform.\nIt is gratifying to note that five of the eight NASA Excellence Award finalists are support contractors. This\nis clear evidence that commitment to teamwork results\nin quality performance.\n\nRobert B. Young, Jr., President, Lockheed\nEngineering and Sciences Company,\nLockheed Corporation\nLockheed Engineering and Science Company is unique in that it is made up of a primarily technical work\nforce, many members of which have advanced degrees.\nThe company\'s headquarters provides basic policy\nand oversight, but rncouragcs a large degree of\nautonomous operation throughout the organization.\nThis type of loose/tight control is based upon a matrix\nmanagement system with a focus on flexibility to meet\nthe needs of the various customers. Operational\nautonomy is facilitated by minimizing the number of\ncontracts and work orders.\nThree areas of focus are evaluation, compensation,\nand communication. Preference is given to promotion\nfrom within the organization. High levels of training\nare offered, and there is significant management involvement in the training program. Overall standards for\ncompensation do not exist; these are determinedon an\nindividual basis, in consideration with the local environment. The Lockheed culture is a proactive one;\nthere is a great deal of interest in leadership, which at\nLockheed is understood to be a particular attitude or\nmethod by which one operates. Leadership has no organizational or level limit. It is determined\'byperspective, language skills (how one relates to the arena of\ndesign and structure), and stretch factors (how one\nmakes sense of change and deals with uncertainty).\nLeaders are people who are able to recognize their risk\ntolerance and work on the edge of it. Most of our work\nactions are directed to fulfilling immediate work requirements and, in general, competency is measured\nby the degree to which these requirements are met.\nHowever, excellence is often measured by the amount\nof action taken on far-sighted, long-range projects.\nTeam building at Lockheed is accomplished through\na combination of NETS and LETS (Lockheed\nEmployee Teams). Many awards are made for team\naccomplishments through the National Management\nAssociation. A sense of team spirit is also fostered\nthrough participation in community activities, playing\ntogether (including pursuit of well being in companyprovided exercise facilities and programs), and periodic social events and celebrations.\n\n3.2.2 LSOC Quality and\nProductivity Through the\nUse of Advanced Technology\nP. EdwardAdamek, Lockheed Space\nOperations Company, Lockheed\nCorporation\nLockheed Corporation has been involved in a range\nof initiatives focused on quality and productivity imprevenient such as laser and voice data tools that\nmeasure gap and step dimensions on the orbiter tiles,\na low-power laser and scanning device, a voice recognition system, and new applications of video processes. In many cases these new tools have eliminated\nprocesses that were cumbersome, time-consuming,\nand susceptible to human error. In other cases, they\ngreatly extend our capability. This is exemplified in the\nCobra borescope, which provides access to many areas\nof hardware that were once inaccessible. Advanced\nmeasurement and analysis techniques afford new\ndegrees of safety and reliability for launches. Lockheed is dedicated to providing the highest quality and\ngreatest value to its customers through increasing\nquality levels, streamlining work methods, and improving productivity.\n\n13\n\nThe Lockheed program is built on people. Its success is clear evidence of the fact that excellence comes\nfrom a commitment to people.\n\n3.3 NASA Excellence Award\n- Mission Services\n\n3.2A Applying the Q/PIP Process\nin a Diverse Task\nEnvironment\n\n33.1 Introductory Remarks\nDale Compton, Deputy Director, Ames\nResearch Center\n\nA. B. Gorham, Jr., General Manager, Pan\nAm World Services, Inc.\n\nQuality evaluation criteria for a research organization such as Ames need to be more clearly understood.\nSome elements, such as zero defects, may be the same\nas those applied to a hardware production environment. However, in research it must be acceptable to\nfail. Hence the quality/productivity improvement effort must be geared to protect the special climate of\nthe research organization.\n\nThe Pan Am World Services effort to build a work\nethic into it- organization has been different from that\nof other companies because of Pan Am\'s unique enviromnent and its diverse work. Initially, barriers were\nidentified: competition existed between some groups\nin Pan Am, some groups felt a lack of challenge, and\nthe work force as a whole did not perceive a common\nmission. In response to the national impetus to increase quality and productivity and the needs of an expanding work force, an incentive fee was added to the\ncontract between Pan Am and NASA.\nThree phases of the evolution of the Quality and\nProductivity Improvement Program (Q/PIP) occurred: (1) pilot period, marked by orientation of\nmanagement, development of teams, and increasing\nautomation, (2) period of acceptance and refinement,\nmarked by continuous championing of the program,\ngradual acceptance of Q/PIP principles, and establishment of key rel tionships, and (3) institutional\nperiod marked by expanding self-motivation. In\nretrospect, it has been noted that three groups of\nemployees were not adequately prepared for conversion to Q/PIP: (1) middle management, which needed\nmore training in Q/PIP principles, (2) supervisors who\nfeared a loss of control, and (3) tenured employees\nwho resisted new patterns. However, as the program\ngot underway, the results in terms of improvement in\nindividual performance were remarkable.\nThe performance objectives matrix is used very effectively at Pan Am. Currently 40% of the organization\nis .involved in -employee teams, with increased incidence of self-managed teams. The program has\nresulted in significant cost savings as well as immeasurable improvements in employee attitudes. The\nmost valuable assessment of its success is in customer\nfeedback.\n\n33.2 Managing Quality in a\nDynamically Changing\nEnvironment\nGerald L. Johnson, Project Manager,\nComputational Mission Services, Boeing\nComputer Support Services, Inc.\nBoeing Computer Support Services operates at Marshall Space Flight Center to provide computer support\nfor the shuttle missions. This critical activity is affected by a high rate of technological change that\nmakes great demands on the work force. Dealing with\nchange is an ever-present challenge, because as soon\nas a system is in place, it is not unusual to receive a\nwhole new set of requirements. The key to Boeing\'s\nsuccess in this environment is having diverse strategies\nfor attaining quality, all geared to meeting the needs\nof the customer. Among these strategies are measurement, communication, an integrated decision system,\na flexible work force, meaningful recognition systems,\nand a "total" system view.\nThe customer-oriented cu\' ure is one that seeks continuous improvement (increasing the productivity\ndelivered for the customer\'s dollar), two-way communication, problem identification (which can save\nthousands of workhours), delegation down to the\nlowest possible level, effective teamwork, and involvement of the entire work force. Measurements should\n\n14\n\ni\n\nM\nai\n\nThe BFEC quality process centers on results through\nthe interaction of all organizational elements. Goals\nset by management are communicated through the organization and are made more specific at each level.\nThese goals form the basis for the yearly quality and\nproductivity plan, which is designed to make a substantial impact on the department in terms of customer\nsatisfaction,. quality improvement, and cost savings.\nThorough Productivity Enhancement Teams\n(PETs), employees prove that "working smarter" is a\nreality at BFEC facilities around the globe. As PET\nmembers, employees voluntarily and actively participate in small groups to identify and solve problems\nand work on projects that increase quality, productivity, organizational efficiency, and cost effectiveness.\nAn indication of the success of BFEC\'s quality and\nproductivity improvement efforts is the awarding of\nthe Network and Mission Operations Support\n(NMOS) contract at the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. On NMOS, BFEC and its subcontractor assumed responsibility for the consolidated operations\nof what had been six distinct contracts. The NMOS\nchallenge involved the blending of an experienced\nworkforce from several other contractors with the\nBFEC working smarter culture. The transition\nmanagement process involved educating management; establishing measures, baselines, and goals;\ncommunicating goals; involving the workforce; and\nmeasuring progress and results.\nThe BFEC commitment to quality has received\nrecognition from the community as well as customers.\nBesides being a finalist for the 1987 NASA Excellence\nAward for Quality and Productivity, BFEC was named\nthe recipient of the first Goddard Excellence Award,\nand was awarded the 1988 U.S. Senate Productivity\nAward for Maryland.\n\nbe used to track what the customer wants and enable\ncontinuous improvement. When uncertainties arise\nabout work processes, the Boeing default option is to\nmeasure, which is frequently a very useful wayto clarify\nissues. Requirement definitions developed with great\ncare to maximize full understanding of issues.\nProblems are fully documented to assure their resolution, and changes in management procedures are\nmade visible to all concerned.\nIndividual achievement of excellence is linked to involvement of the work force through communication\nsystems, employee development, and recognition initiatives. An executive interview program allows\nemployees to meet annually with the supervisor two\nlevels above to discuss work issues. Daily 15-minute\nstand-up meetings are held each morning to brief the\nwork force on the status of the program.\nThis total program of varied elements has enabled\nBoeing to meet demanding customer requirements\nand make substantial contract cost savings.\n\n333 Are You Smarter Today\nThan Yesterday?\n\nJerry Barsky, Deputy Program Manager.\nNetwork and Mission Operations Support,\nBen& Field Engineering Corporation\nThe Bendix FlAd Engineering Corporation (BFEC)\ncommitment to quality is based on doing things right\nthe first time, the ultimate purpose of which is to\nprovide optimum customer support.

One\ntends to get the kind of behavior that is rewarded.\nDouglas Aircraft views goals in terms of short-term\nand long-term priorities, taking a decentralized approach that empowers the entire work force. An effective measurement program is dependent upon four\nelements: (1) a systems approach, (2) adequate skills,\n(3) positive consequences, and (4) adequate feedback.\n\n4.1 Overview of Quality\nMeasurement\n4.1.1 Making Measurement Work\nat Douglas Aircraft\nDavid R. Braunstein, Director of Quality\nand Productivity Improvements, Douglas\nAircraft Company\n\n4.1.2 Measurement Initiatives at\nBoeing Computer Services\n\nIn 1980 McDonnell Douglas Corporation undertook\na self-renewal program based on implementation of\nstrategic thinking, employee participation, human\nresource development, quality and productivity improvement, and ethical decision-making. These elements have since been incorporated into a Significant\nBusiness Issue (SBI) project, whereby one area of each\ncomponent of the corporation is identified for extensive evaluation and improvement.\nDouglas Aircraft Company selected "satisfy your customer with first-time quality" as its SBf. This represented a totally different company goal and a new way\nfor employees to approach their jobs. Employee work\ngroups spend approximately six to ten months going\nthrough a five-phase quality/productivity improvement process that begins with a two-week training\nprogram for approximately 100 people. The process\nphases are: (1) establish an improvement commitment, (2)specify the process, (3) talk to customers, (4)\ndevelop goals/measurements, and (5) reinforce the\ncommitment.By the end of October 1988, 10,000\nemployees will have gone through this program, which\nwill eventually be extended to the entire work force\nand the supplier team.\nThe results of the program exceed initial expectations: Douglas Aircraft has undergone a cultural\nchange. Managers now are working as partners with\ntheir employees to achieve quality and productivity improvement goals. The \'boss" is now perceived to be\nthe customer.\nIn effecting this cultural change, Douglas Aircraft\navoided the use of slogans; a great many slogans were\nused in the past, and the work force had become skep-\n\nDavid L. Nelson, Manager, Statistics for\nQuality, Boeing Computer Services\nEffective measurement is a basis for action to support continuous quality improvement of products, services, and processes.

Measurements are a tool whereby the role\nof employees, suppliers, and customers may each be\naddressed in terms of input requirements (what we expect of our suppliers) and output requirements (what\nour customers expect of us). Measurements are used\nto ascertain differences between what is expected and\nwhat is delivered, and they are made by attaching\nmeters at specific points in the work process. A good\nunderstanding of statistics is essential to evaluate\nmeasurements. Once the measurements have been\n-valuated, controls can be applied, and the differences between special causes and common causes can be\nidentified. The goal is a standardized level of excellence; variation is the enemy.\nSince Boeing Computer Services has no specific\nproduct, its measurements arc Scared to how well it is\nachieving a mission. A bottom-line question "why are\nwe here?" leads to responses in terms of "to increase,\nto decrease, to reduce, to improve, to eliminate, to enhance." Statistical answers may not be entirely valid;\n\n\t\n17\n\ni\n\none must not become entirely dependent upon\nnumerical definitions.\nOnce a mission statement is clear and accurate,\nvarious possible measurements become evident. The\nmission statement itself is subject to measurement. If\nrelated activities are underway, their progress can be\nmeasured. Both hard measurements (such as customer surveys) and soft measurements (such as assessment of how things are done) are useful. A measurement matrix provides agood overview of the information collected. However, quality must always be\nmeasured in the eye of the customer, especially because the customer always knows something that we\ndon\'t know. You have to keep asking the customer,\n"How am I doing?" Any negative input that is received\ncan be viewed as useful data. Whatever the defined\nproduct, measurements should lead us to achieving\nmore of it at a lower cost. This goal is reached by\nfocusing on elements of the work process rather than\nthe ultimate product.\nA cost of quality must be assignedto external failures,\nprevention of defects, and internal failures. These will\nvary, but certainly the greatest cost is that associated\nwith the delivery of poor quality to a customer.\nObviously the ways one measures manufacturing are\ndifferent from how one measures R&D efforts. It is\neasier to make measurements on the factory floor, but\nin all cases the key is to keep the mission statement\nclearly in mind. A great many cost savings can be realized from improvements in administrative areas, all of\nwhich will depend on effective measurements. The\nquality management concept must permeate the white\ncollar segment of the work force. Once management\nassimilates the quality/productivity improvement\nprocess, it will filter down to lower levels. This will involve just-in -time training and a willingness to turn off\nunusable management systems.\nThere are questions still to be answered about the\npurpose of measurements, who will measure what,\nwhen, and how; we are still learning about how to construct an ideal measurement report, about which\npeople should receive it, and what they will be able to\ndo with it. We need to strive for (1) simple measurements, (2) ease of data gathering, (3) assurance of data\nvalidity, (4) attention to measurement of intermediate\nsteps, (5) use of existing data whenever possible, and\n(6) selection of measurements that will be worthwhile\nover a period of time. Implementation of measurement a continuous learning process that will ultimately be of great benefit to the quality/productivity\nimprovement effort.\n\n4.2 Measurement\nTechniques and\nMethodologies\n4.2.1 Introduction\nR. Ross Bowman, Vice President, Safety,\nReliability, and Quality Assurance, Motion\nThiokol, Inc.\nMeasurement is an essential step in achieving quality\nand productivity improvement. Morton Thiokol set\nbold goals to reduce flight set non-conformances and,\nby providing the proper resources and tracking\nprogress with measurements, has allowed employees\nto succeed in reaching the goals. Measurements make\nit possible for people to win.\n\n4.2.2 Lessons Learned in\nImplementing the Objectives\nMatrix and Using the Data\nfor Corrective Action\nDean R. Lee, Director, Quality/Productivity,\nSystems Support Croup, Unisys Corporation\nAs part of an overall process aimed at quality improvement at the Unisys Corporation, an objectives\nmatrix is used to measure progress in reaching established goals. This toot assists managers in tracking and\nreporting improvement initiatives and was introduced\nas one part of a total effort to make the work force\naware of management\'s commitment to and involvement in quality enhancement.\nPitfalls to the introduction of white collar measurement are characterized in ce-nments to the effect that\n"you don\'t understand our work area" and "you can\'t\nmeasure our kind of creativity." Perfect measurements are probably not achieveable, but very good\nmeasurements are possible if simplicity and consistency are maintained. The cost of quality improvement\nmay be difficult to establish; however, the Unisys\nprogram is dedicated to making improvements even if\nthey don\'t result in cost savings. The Unisys Quality\nCouncil includes one representative from each depart-\n\nis\n\n4\n\nF\n\nra.,\n\nAccurate data are essential for meaningful measurements, but collecting it can be difficult because of\nmanagers\' rather natural inclination to build buffers\ninto schedules and resource requirements. Human\nresources was the first area to be put into the system,\nfollowed by the financial system, and then the facilities\narea. The financial system governs the MY database\neffectively, and there is a continuing effort to include\ngreater depth of information detail. The most vital ingredient in the success ofMZP2 is management\'s commitment to use it, to expend the energy to measure\nresource utilization and to act upon the lessons\nlearned.\n\nmenl and from the administrative area; this group\noversees departmental teams that establish measurements and corrective actions. The objectives matrix is\nformed on the basis of first identifying elements that\nreflect work quality. Criteria for achieving these elementsare then specified, prioritized, and broken down\ninto mini-objectives for which appropriate measurements are determined. Selected objectives are challenging and perhaps optimistic, but potentially obtainable. A numerical system of tracking improvement is applied to the matrix, which provides project\nmanagement with a standardized method of reviewing\nand reporting on the status of work activities. Corrective actions are recommended as part of the objectives\nreview process. Success of the objectives matrix at\nUnisys has depended upon its gradual implementation, beginning with areas which were expected to be\nmost receptive, and a recognition that efforts for improvement should be set aside when an objective has\n"peaked out." It can be effectively supported by available software, and it is excellent for brinlgng issues into\nfocus and enabling significant improvements.\n\n4.3 Successful Measurement\nApplications\n\n43.1 Measurement at Ford\nAerospace & Communications\nCorporation\n\n4.23 Multi-Mission Production\nPlanning System - Lessons\nLearned\n\nDavid L Blanchard, Director, Space\nSystems Engineering Operations, Ford\nAerospace & Communications Corporation\n\nDavid E. Peterson, Manager, Planning\nSystems, Rockwell Shuttle Operations\nCompany\n\nThe implications measurement became critical to\nFord when it was discovered that power transmissions\nwhich met all engineering quality design specifications\nwere causing a significant number of problems in actual operation. This was a clear indication that customer needs were not being met and that current\nmeasurements were inadequate. In investigating the\nproblem, Ford discovered that the transmissions were\nacceptable from a component standpoint, but that the\nsystem design and manufacturing process was faulty.\nThe problem was satisfactorily resolved, and new insight was gained on the importance of diverse\nmeasurement approaches.\n\nThe Multi-Mission Production Planning Systems\n\n(WP2) is a very useful database tool that integrates\n\nand measures project schedules and costs of the complex flight production process. Because the process\ninvolves highly detailed planning and preparation for\neach shuttle flight, numerous organizations and\nproducts, frequent scheduleand manifest changes,\nand critical resources, as well as coordination of multiple flight agendas, precise measurements are essential.\nThe M2P2 is used to monitor the overall process and\nto provide data regarding specific requirements and\nimpacts of individual tasks, including the amount of\nmanagement visibility, schedule constraints, and f iture adjustments. Building and implementing the tool\ni\nwere initially expected requ re about an wqual effort;\nin fact, about 20% of the effort has gone into developwent, and the greater challenge has been gathering\ndata, designing procedures, and training personnel.\n\n19\n\n43.3 The Importance of\nMeasurements to Support a\nTotal Quality Effort at Florida\nPower and Light\n\n43.2 Performance Measurement;\nThe Key to Productivity\nRobert J. Keymont, Vice President of\nProduction Operations, Missile Systems,\nMartin Marietta Corporation\n\nMichael L. Fedotowsky, Laboratory\nSupervisor, Florida Power and Light\nCompany\n\nIn early 1986, the production operations function of\nMartin Marietta\'s Missile Systems began implementation of a series of performance measurement techniques and team initiatives to create an environment in\nwhich quality was the top priority. A key element of\nthis effort was the establishment of Performance\nMeasurement Teams (PMTs), which were composed\nof all the hourly workers in each manufacturing work\ncenter, the area supervisor who acted as the team\nleader, and representatives from Manufacturing Engineering; Industrial Engineering, Planning and Control, and Product Quality who were assigned to support the area.\nTo provide focus for work center involvement in\nquality performance, a performance measurement\nsystem was established which provided weekly performance measurement on shop yield, scrap, performance to schedule, performance to standard, overtime, and lost time at the manufacturing work center\nlevel Goals were established for each measurement\nand all data was placed on special PMT boards in each\nwork center.\nToday, in conference rooms dedicated for PMT use,\nwork center PMTS hold mandatory weekly meetings\nto review their own performance and resolve issues\nthat impact the work center performance. Issues that\nare "too big" for the work center teams to resolve are\nelevated up the existing departmental chain of command for action. The commitment and involvement of\nmid-level and upper management is key to the success\nof the process. Outstanding team performance is\nrecogncRd through Team-of-the-Month and Teamof-the-Year competitions.\nTh- PMT process has helped the company to meet\nand surpass customer requirements. The Martin\nMarietta experience is that, once the quality and\nproductivity improvement process is underway and\nproblems resolved, measurable objectives will be met,\nexceeded, and new objectives established..\n\nA system of total quality control has been successfullyimplemented at Florida Power and Light Company.\nThe basic measures were derived from strategic goals.\nThe company was a very good provider of service in\ncomparison with other utilities in the United States,\nbut it did not rate well on world-wide scale. Management realized that a visionto be one of the world\'s best\ncould only be achieved by setting out very specific\nquantitative, measurable goals. The company sought\nto improve the reliability of electric service to customer facilities by avoiding service interruptions,\nreducing the number of customer complaints and work\ntime lost due to injuries.\nFlorida Power and Light\'s experience is that if a\nvision is established, if management is totally committed, and if the tools, techniques, and action plans\ncanbe implemented, positive results are ensured. The\nresults may not beattained immediately, but with constant visibility and attention to problem areas, they\neventually may even exceed the original expectations.\n\n20\n\nPanel C1 -Overview of Quality Measurement: (from left to right) David L.

Williams, Langley Research Centcr\n\n22\n\n5.0\t\n\nCreating a Quality Environment\nThe Rockwell International strategic planning\nprocess involves all organizational levels, including\ncorporate, operations, divisions, and business segments. It begins with corporate visibility, direction,\nand interaction, and involves each level\'s (1) management responsibility and authoritative control, (2) optimum use of staff and resources, and (3) knowledge\nof opportunities and limitations. Since activities are\ninitiated within the business segment of the organization, an early part of strategic planning must be geared\nto defining business segments, customers, products,\ncompetition, and business issues as well as providing\nfor synergistic functional grouping and\nentrepreneurial management.\nQuality is an inherent consideration in each portion\nof Rockwell\'s strategic plan because survival and\ngrowth of the organization will be determined by the\namount of value provided to the customer. Although\ncustomer value is determined both in terms of value\nand cost, one of the most effective ways to achieve stepby-step improvement in corporate performance is to\nfocus on quality. At Rockwell this quality focus is\nreflected in the Division President\'s annual Quality\nand Productivity Review with the Chairman and CEO,\nthe annual All-Division Quality and Productivity Conference, and the Rockwell credo. The credo, "What\nWe Believe," states that (1) maximizing the satisfaction\nof customers is vital to warranting their continued\nloyalty, (2) superior value to customers is measured in\nterms of high technology, fair prices, exceptional service, and (3) organizational success is dependent upon\nmarket leadership and the highest standards of ethics\nand integrity.\n\n5.1 Strategic Planning Implications for Quality\n5.1.1 Strategic Planning - The Basis\nfor Quality Performance\nLouis R DeAngelis, Director, Human\nResources and Organizational Development,\nNASA Headquarters\nTraditionally the driving force in NASA has been the\nbudget process, an activity for which you program\nrather than plan, Recently NASA has realized that\nthis budget process does not permit a long-term\nperspective or the integration of programmatic and institutional requirements. It is strategic planning that\nsets the basis for quality, ensuring that the right things\nare being done and that resources are allocated to\nachieve the fundamental purposes of the organization.\nStrategic planning provides the context to determine\nif we are doing the right things, to define quality and\nproductivity, to balance cost and quality, and to identify the things we should elect not to do.\nStrategic planning can promote organizational success when used as atool to establish clear, challenging,\nand exciting goals and to foster (1) an open, creative\nenvironment, (2) teamwork, (3) a strong scientific and\ntechnological base, (4) public and Congressional support, (5) a world-class institution, and (6) clear, efficient lines of organizational authority and accountability.\n\n5.1.3 Quality - The Business\nStrategy\n\n5.1.2 An Approach to Strategic\nPlanning - Reinforcing the\nImportance of Quality\n\nJames A. Warren, Director of Product\nAssurance, RockwellAutomotve Operations\n\nRichard F. Stehle, Director, Business\nPlanning and Development, Rockwell\n\nCompanies these days must move away from\nplatitudes to real, meaningful initiatives with which the\nwork force can identify. This is not an easy transition;\nthe slogan "no pain, no change" would aptly describe\nit. Quality is a term that we use to refer to the strategy\n\nInternational Corporation\n\n23\n\n4\n6\n\nt\n\nmaterials supplied, product design, employee dedication, and customer adherence to prescribed procedures. Lincoln\'s approach has been to hire the best\npossible work force, to prepare employees to be fully\nproductive, and to develop latent abilities. The hiring\nresponsibility ultimately is borne by upper management which makes final approval of all new hives.\nEmployees are paid for piecework, and approximately 50% of the pay is in the form of a year-end bonus.\nEach employee is responsible for his own quality and\nattendance. These practices reflect the Lincoln belief\nthat hard work is healthy, whereas unemployment or\nlack of control over one\'s work is unhealthy. Internal\npromotions are common, and management maintains\nan open-door policy. An advisory board composed of\nfactoryworkers meets every other weekwith the President and Chairman of the Board. Production quality\naccounts for 25% of an employee\'s merit rating, with\nautomatic merit penalties associated with some customer rejections. This emphasis on individual responsibility minimizes the need for direct supervision; Lincoln has one foreman for approximately 100\nemployees.\nLincoln\'s program allows employees to work with individual responsibility for quality production and incentives for advancement; it has made the company a\nleader in its field, both nationally and internationally.\n\nusedto improve our product and lower our cost. Planning should be based on what the customer wants,\nrather than what the engineer wants, and it should\nwork to drive the voice of the customer down through\nthe organization. We need to get away from the viewpoint that "you get what you pay for" and from product\nredesign late in the process and move forward, increasing customer satisfaction and reducing development time. The added value of the management team\nis the creation of a culture that affects the work force\nso as to stimulate discretionary effort.\n\n5.1.4 Establishing an Environment\nfor Quality\nNathaniel B. Cohen, Director, Strategic\nPlanning andAnalysis, NASA Headquarters\nNASA strategic planning is an effort that has been\nunderway for about three years. IL has proven very\nsuccessful so far, but much work remains to be done.\nBasically, NASA\'s strategic planning is geared to establishing an agency mission, setting standards and\ncriteria for quality, and developinga culture with\nmotivation and commitment that will produce excellence at all levels. This planning is based on statutes,\npolicies, and agency themes that promote excellence\nin programmatic and institutional goals. It is an effort\nthat cascades up and down at all levels, including\nprogram offices and NASA field centers. It has\nbrought about improved communication, coordination, and integration.\n\n5.2.2 Managing the Change to Total\nQuality\nW. N. Moore, Manager, Corporate Quality\nPrograms, Westinghouse Productivity and\nQuality Center, Westinghouse Electric\nCorporation\n\n5.2 Quality Culture at All\nLevels\n\nAt one time the products we used were typically\nmade in the United States. However, this period of\nhigh inventories and high tolerance of error was destined to end as quality, low-cost Japanese products\nbecame increasingly available. We have had to make\na radical change in our industrial model. For the\nWestinghouse Electric Corporation, a large, diverse,\ndecentralized operation, a total quality perspective\ncame to be defined as leadership in meeting customer\nrequirements by doing the right things right the first\ntime.\nSince 1981 activities at the Westinghouse Productivity and Quality Center have focused on defining the\nconditions of total quality, which depend upon four\n\n5.2.1 Quality Culture at Lincoln\nElectric Company\nRichard S. Sabo, Assistant to the Chief\nExecutive Officer, Lincoln Electric Company\nLincoln Electric is awelding company that meets the\nexacting standards of its high -technology customers.\nAttaining quality depends upon the excellence of\n\n24\n\n2a\n\ngiven to what needs exist and what resources are available that aren\'t being fully used. Integration and affordability are the principal obstacles. Since an old\nsystem has been in effect for a long time, change will\nrequire a great deal of effort. The bottom line has to\ndo with adopting an effective mechanism for rewarding contractors for quality performance. Eventually it\nwill be recognized that delivering quality, not meeting\nschedules, is the most critical element.\nUnderstanding our role is essential in determining\nwhat we have to do. As part of the management\nprocess to make the most of resources, we must tell the\ncontractors what we as customers need from them.\nThe Systems Command has quality improvement test\nprograms underway; based on experience with them;\nthe effort will be extended into other areas. At this\npoint, it is clear that there is a very positive link between quality and value.\n\nbasic areas of focus: (1) customer-oriented\nphilosophy, (2) excellence of human resources, (3) optimum product process, and (4) visibility of management leadership.\nTotal Quality Fitness Reviews of work areas are held\nby cognizant management with participation of peer\nmanagers from other areas to identify improvement\nopportunities. Usually the reviews first address\nmanagement and personnel issues and then deal with\nproduct problems. Measurement of improvement is\nthe final step, owe thatWestinghouse is just nowbeginning to undertake. The review approach has resulted\nin cost reduction, improved morale, increased system\ncontrol, and quality improvements.\n\n5.2.3 Quality and Cost: The Vital\nLink\n\n5.2.4 Ford Motor\'s Quality-1\n\nLieutenant Colonel Tames C. Daugherty,\nUSAF, Chief, Producibility, Quality and\nStandardization Division, Headquarters, Air\nForce Systems Command\n\nCraig Koontz, Quality Action Team\nFacilitator, Ford Electronics and\nRefrigeration Plant\n\nQuality management practices are essential to the\nAir Force Systems Command in meeting its responsibility to spend the taxpayers\' dollars wisely and to\ndeliver high performance systems to the field. A\nphilosophy of continuous improvement means that\nmerely "doing business as usual" is no longer acceptable. Understanding the role of quality has required\nserious reevaluation by the Systems Command because participants in a high technology effort tend to\nthink chiefly in terms of functions. Schedules appear\nto drive operational support and costs, and yet the\nproblem may be with a poor design or poor manufacturing process. Therefore, achieving quality requires\nconsideration of the total production operation.\nThe Systems Command plan for instituting Total\nQuality Management is based on steps geared to (1)\nfoster awareness, (2) remove barriers and develop performance incentives, (3) develop tools and techniques,\n(4) implement programs, and (5) assess results. By the\nend of this year, all systems managers will have gone\nthrough the Deming training. Thus, we know about\nthe tools; it remains to learn what will work in this\nspecific case.\nBasically, the Systems Command is working in accordance with a master DOD plan, which calls for a\nrevision of the acquisition process over the next seven\nyears. As part of the revision, consideration is being\n\nQuality and productivity improvement initiatives at\nFord Motor Company have been instituted through a\nQuality-1 Program which came into being in part as a\nresult of pressure to compete with the Japanese\nautomobile manufacturers. The quality of a product\nis determined by the degree to which it satisfies customer needs. The quality improvement process is a\nfundamental one at Ford. A Ford division may petition management to review it for the Quality-1 award.\nReceiving the award is both a valued recognition and\nan assurance that the division will continue its work\nfunction. When a plant decides to go for the award, it\nfirst undertakes a self-evaluation that includes surveying its customers; it then determines if it meets the\ncriteria, and requests management approval of its candidacy. After this, independent assessments are\nmade, including those of the plant\'s customers, and\nmanagement conducts an on-site assessment. If the\naward is denied, the plant must wait 12 months before\ncompeting for it again. The status of Quality-1 plants\nis reviewed annually and may be rescinded, most\nnotably at a customer\'s request. Criteria for the award\ninclude participative management, employee morale,\nutilization of new talent, and housekeeping.\nEmployees are fully involved in the application for\n\n25\n\nLevel 3 task includes satisfying and verifying the\nprogram plan. Authority is delegated down to the\nlowest level practical and commensurate with\ndemonstrated, real accountability.\nAs part of the planning process, the life-cycle cost will\nalways be a key decision driver, starting with development cost The TMIS will be the basic Space Station\nmanagement tool, so its development is critical to the\noverall program. In addition to the teamwork and\ntools that are so vital to the Space Station, the importance of individual responsibility is continually\nstressed. We say that every person in the Space Station organization must think and perform as a systems\nmanager, taking the broadest possible view of the\nprogram objectives. It is only with this kind of apwill\nproach that we\nachieve our goal of mission success.\n\nQuality-1, and are informed regularly about the status\nof the evaluation.\nIn the case of the Ford Electronics and Refrigeration\nPlant, train was a critical factor in receiving the\naward. At this site, employees were involved in\nregular, mandatory business meetings and also took\npart in task forces that worked overtime on avolunteer\nbasis to study and resolve specific problems. Participative management was also afactor in winning the\naward; this was facilitated through the communication\ngenerated through a newsletter. Union support was\nalso a vital factor. Ford Motor Company\'s CEO has\ncalled\'foranimproved corporate culture, with all areas\nachieving Quality-1 status by 1990. Beyond Quality-1,\nFord\'s Total Quality Executive Award.is given to those\nwho are most excellent among the Quality-1 winners.\n\n53.2 Boeing\'s Design Build Team\nApproach to WPOI\n\n5.3 Designing for the Future\n- Space Station\n\nJohn B.

These teams provide the productivity\nmechanism for translating large organization resources into small organization responsiveness and pride\nof personal involvement\nOptimum systems engineering at Boeing is based\nupon use of proven methods, a large engineering\nmaster database, automated design capability, consistency with paperless initiatives, functional modeling,\nand suitability for support analysis. Benefits of such\nengineering are realized in streamlined interface coordination, common sources for requirements and\nspecifications, available data to support simulations,\nuser access to pictures and data sources, traceability\nfor design compliance verification, and cost\navoidance.\n\nJames B. Odom, Associate Administrator for\nSpace Station, NASA Headquarters\nThe United States has a clearly defined space policy\nthat calls for development of the Space Station as a\npermanent, manned international effort with flexible\ncapability for the future. Space Station development\nhas been ateam effort, and all Space Station managers\nare aware of their obligation to create an environment\nthat fosters teamwork. The team includes a "silent\nwork force," those who will never make the headlines,\nbut who have contributed in many vital ways.\nThe Space Station guiding principles are all directed\nto the top priority, mission success. Quality is planned\nin, designed in, and built in, not inspected in. Emphasis is upon keeping things simple, and this includes\nminimizing organizational and hardware interfaces.\nWe seek to maximize clear hardware and software accountability, margins, and redundancy while maintaining full management control. When automation,\nrobotics and Al capability are not built in, the policy\nis to accommodate them by hooks and scars.\nLevels of management responsibility are clearly\ndefined Levels 1 and 2 develop and manage the\nprogram, and Level 3 and the prime contractors\ndesign, develop, and fabricate the Space Station.

In Space Station development, this toplevel commitment is communicated to and implemented within the various distributed systems that address basic flight elements. Three tools have been useful for achieving productivity and quality, improvements: ( 1) electronic data development, which allows\nexpanded versatility in design and elimination of many\ncostly engineering mock - ups, (2) development teams,\nwhich ensure that all disciplines are represented and\nprovide input at the design formation stage, and (3)\nrisk management concepts, which establish a method\nfor identifying, assessing, and resolving (statusingrisks.\n\nGeorge J.

Since the contractor\nparticipates in the award fee establishment process, he\nis kept aware of the determining factors. All contract\npersonnel feed into an SRM&QA monitor who\nreviews the information, the Performance Evaluation\nBoard recommends a fee amount, and the Deputy\nCenter Director gives final approval.\nA number of useful revisions were made in the safety\nreporting system in areas such as hazard analysis,\nmishap reporting, modeling analysis, the governmentlindustry data exchange program, discrepancies\nin materiel review, and defects found in hardware post\ndelivery. These improvements, combined with effectively administered award fees, will help us meet our\nmission challenges and keep the NASA/contractor\nwork force motivated and committed to performance\nexcellence. Management has to be the leader and\nshare its enthusiasm for potential achievements.\n\n6.1 NASA\'s Approach to\nContract Incentives\nLeroy E. Hopkins, Deputy Assistant\nAdministrator for Procurement, NASA\nHeadquarters\nUntil recently NASA has not had clear value engineering policies because this area was felt to apply\nto production engineering rather than R&D efforts.\nNow, however, the substantial potential benefits of\nvalue engineering for both NASA and its contractors\nare recognized; for example, it resulted in a $9 million\nsavings in a contract with Martin Marietta for the external tank. A major OMB policy change this year requires that value engineering clauses be included in\nnearly all NASA contracts and that a NASA value engineering department be established. This is a challenging new activity, one that will be demanding in\nterms of resources and effort, but that will include\nbasic elements of quality and productivity improvement and that should provide us with a useful avenue\nby which to reach our goals.\n\n6.3 Task Force Report from\nthe Fourth Annual\nNASA/ Contractors\n\n6.2 SRM&QA Criteria in\n\nConference\n\nAward Fee\nAleranderA.

We had to get away from the old\n\nA broad-based Task Force was established after the\nFourth Annual NASA/Contractors Conference to\nmake recommendations concerning quality and\nproductivity improvement ( Q/PI) contract incentives\ndiscussed at that conference. The Task Force gave\nconsideration to all proposals and solicited input from\ncontractors, NASA Headquarters, and the NASA\n\nContract Incentives Review Task Force,\nLewis Research Center\n\ncenters.\n\n29\n\n=^aX.iu.\n"\'^Smrs.ve\xe2\x80\xa2.:\xc2\xab:X_a;VV^ e\xc2\xbb^-d:\'ust\'"sor\n\n,r...als..uvyre:.v\t\n\n,we.u^^.E\'d\xc2\xb11^.eANFC.Y^rel " \'lfk^rcY^r -a..\xc2\xbb.i^m s \t\n\n.. -\n\n[i\nf\n\nr\nt\nt\n\nFee. The Task Force felt that gainsharing should involve investment from both the government and contractor. Fast Payback was discussed as a means to\nreward contractors for long-range improvements\nwhich would require up- front funding. Rewards could\nbe provided either through Award Fee or a shared\nsavings mechanism; Fast Payback improvements\n,:ould likely require a downward adjustment to contract target cost.\nBased on the Task Force rccomm mdations, NASA\nhas agreed to amend the NASA FAR Supplement to\nconsider soliciting and evaluating offerors\' Q/PI approaches as part of the source selection process for appropriate contracts. Evaluation criteria could include\ncontract specific criteria as well as generic; potential\nfactors could include projected benefits to the Eovcrn-\n\nThere were several objectives cited for Q/P1 incentives. They provide; a way to achieve assessable\nbenefits to the government by rewarding contractors\nfor improvements in quality, productivity and/or\ntimeliness above and beyond what would normally , be\n\xc2\xad xpcctcd under a contract. These incentives should\nflow down the government\'s Q/PI objectives\nthroughout the contractor\'s organization and to subcontractors, and share the benefits of improvements\nequitably with the contractor. Finally, Q/PI incentives\nshould cncouragc continuous irnpro , ; ment efforts as\nwell as tangible results.\nThe keys to success in u , ing Q/PI incentives were\ndeemed to be up-front agreements and understandings about the expectations of all parties involved, and the selection of the propc.- incentivc(s) for\nthe contract. These incentives should be part of contract negotiations. Potential incentives discussed by\nthe team included Award Fee Pools for Q; P1; Gainsharing; Fast Payback; Integrated Suggestion\nPrograms (which allow contractors and civil scr ants\nto be rewarded for suggestions made concerning each\nother\'s operation); and manv others.\nAward Fee was the most highly weighted Q,TI incentive, and could ins olve establishing a separate pool\nunder the Award I-cc. Flexibilit y was considered critical, and the performance evaluation plan should\nchange to reflect prospective changes in emphasis.\nGovernment to contractor gainsharing was deemed to\nhave good potential as a n ow down mechanism for\nQ,/PI objectives - especiall y if combined with Award\n\nment, management of the Q/PI effort, creating an enNironmcnt for improved qualit y and productivit y , and\nactive invol y mcnt in Q`Pl and quality program:, of\nsubcontractors. It is hoped that this will help to estabIt an up-front meeting of the minds, and addre:,s the\nissue of Q/PI objectives "flow-down."\nIn addition, NASA has agreed to dcveli 7n training\nprograms for both government and contractor p:\xe2\x80\xa2 r"i. rincl concernine Q/P1 criteria; Q/Pl contr^xl incentive\nmechanisms; and incorporation of Q,\'Pl into the\nAward Fee process.

Future software environments will demand that\nwe (1) share work products, (2) support basic software\nengineering principles, (3) define, capture, and\nmeasure processes, (4) automate process tasks, and\n(5) improve process task analysis. Software quality\nand reliability can\'t be addressed in a vacuum; they\nmust be designed in to be fully responsive to the needs\nof the customer.\n\n7.1 Introduction\nMarilyn W. Bush, Section Manager,\nSoftware Product Assurance, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory\nWith a 10 to 1.00-fold software quality improvement\nexpected in the next 10 years, development of good\nsoftware quality plans is essential. Effective software\nquality planning and management depend upon a\nstrong leadership commitment to make optimum use\nof available and proven software methodologies and\ntools.\n\n7.3 Improving Software\nQuality and Reliability\nin Different\nEnvironments\n\n7.2 Software Quality\n\nat IBM\n\nIlene Birkwood(, lice President, Corporate\nQuality, Tandem Computers\n\nEnterprise Systems\n\nTraditionally, the main elements of software quality\nhave been identified in terms of performance,\navailability, responsiveness, supportability, and user\nfriendliness. However, we now see that the quality of\nsoftware can be greatly enhanced by appropriate training and automation, follow-up by consultants, meaningful measurements, and publicized successes.\nAutomation will not be effective if it is applied to a\nprocess that is faulty or to one where there is no control. A program should not be implemented\neverywhere at once; implementation should start \xc2\xb56th\nthe people who are most receptive, building on their\nexperience to continue the implementation. Selling\npeople on new methods is the secret to 5wceess. Resistance to the introduction of soTaare is resistance to\nthe fact that there are going to be different ways of\ndoing things. Typically people are comfortable with\nthe old methods, which are well understood and do get\nresults; converting to new methods requires a great\ndeal of user education. Training must be carried out\nby designated individsals; if the trainers can not be\nreadily identified, training probably is not occurring.\nThe opportunities for training in non-threatening environments should not be overlooked. Frequently this\nis accomplished informally when those more ex-\n\nRichard B. Butler, Director of System\nProgramming, IBMEnterprise Systems\nWhen implementing a software quality plan, consideration should be given to (1) the nature and\ncriticality of work for which it will be used, (2) quality\nbased on conformance to requirements, (3) early\nelimination of problems, (4) the need for a rigorous\nprocess, (5) the inevitability of human error, and (6)\nlessons learned from defects encountered. Development of present IBM operating systems has been underway for 25 year; decisions, therefore, have longterm effects, and we must build in quality as a legacy\nfor the future.\nIBM software that is being developed for such critical areas as medical analysis and aircraft design must\nhave the highest level of quality and reliability. Since\nquality means conformance to customer requirements, accurate definition of these requirements is an\nimportant initial step. Once the requirements are fully\nspecified, each phase of system development must be\ncarefully analyzed; finding the bugs in a system early\non will mean tremendous cost savings. IBM\'s product\ndevelopment objectives are aimed at zero defects, im-\n\n31\n\nperienced in a Particular software function share their\nexperti..\t\nh novices.\nFinally, a variety of measurements should be made.\nThe choice of measurements should be haled upon\nwhat information would be most useful to know. A\ngood time to measure is when one is at a decision point.\nOnce the measurement information is gathered, it can\nserve both as a guide to subsequent software irnplementation and as a record of experience from\nwhich to publicize process improvements.\n\nPanel F - Software Quall y and Rcli,thility: (from Icft to right) Walter P.
