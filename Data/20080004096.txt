During baking, the film must be held down\nagainst a flat or other surface to which the final sheet is\nto conform, to avoid curling of the sheet into a brittle\nunwanted shape. A vacuum hold-down can be used to\nhold the sheet while it is baked. However, it is found\nthat the sheet is subject to cracking as it shrinks, due to\nthe vacuum holding all portions of the original sheet in\ntheir original positions. A device for holding thin workpieces against a surface, which enabled the workpieces\nto change dimensions while they continued to be held\nclosely against the surface, would be of value in the\nforming of the sheets described above as well as other\nthin workpieces that had to be heat treated.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present\ninvention, a hold-down device is provided for holding a\nthin workpiece while it undergoes dimensional changes,\nwhich permits creep of the workpiece to enable dimensional change thereof without deformity while continuing to hold the workpiece closely against a support\nsurface. The wall which forms the support surface has a\nmulitiplicity of holes arranged in a plurality of zones. A\nmeans for applying vacuum to the holes to hold the\nworkpiece against the surface, is constructed to repeatedly stop applying the vacuum to different of the zones\nat different times while continuing to apply the vacuum\nto other zones. At the time the vacuum is interrupted at\nthe zone, the portion of the workpiece at that zone can\ncreep along the support surface, and yet that zone of the\nworkpiece is held substantiallyto the support surface by\nthe vacuum applied to adjacent zones.\nThe novel features of the invention are set forth with\nparticularity in the appended claims. The invention will\nbe best understood from the following description when\nread in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n\n10\n\nl5\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n3o\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION O F THE DRAWINGS\nFIG. 1 is a perspective view of a vacuum hold-down 55\nconstructed in accordance with one embodiment of the\npresent invention.\n.\nFIG. 2 is a view taken on the line 2 2 of FIG. 1\nFIG. 3 includes a series of graphs showing the variation of pressure with time at each of the zones of the 60\napparatus of FIG. 2\n.\nFIG. 4 is a perspective view of another hold-down\ndevice of the invention.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\n65\nEMBODIMENTS\nFIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a vacuum hold-down device\n10which can hold a thin workpiece 12 against a support\n\nsurface 14 while the workpiece undergoes a change in\ndimensions. Such change is usually a result of heat treating of the workpiece, as by heating and cooling it within\nan oven 15.The device includes an upper wall 16 which\nforms the support surface, and a multiplicity of holes 18\nin the upper wall for applying a vacuum to the workpiece resting on the support surface to hold the workpiece tightly against the surface. A group of conduits\n21-24 couple a vacuum source 26 to corresponding\nplenums 31-34 that lead to the holes to apply vacuums\nto the holes.\nIn prior art vacuum hold-downs, the vacuum was\napplied continuously while the workpiece was heat\ntreated. Where the workpiece undergoes a significant\nchange in lateral dimensions L and W (which are perpendicular to the thickness dimension T of the thin\nworkpiece) while its temperature changes or a solvent\nof the like is driven from the workpiece, damage can\noccur to the workpiece. If the workpiece contracts,\nthen tears can arise in the workpiece as the different\nportions draw apart, while if the workpiece expands,\nlocalized areas may develop wrinkles.\nIn one manufacturing operation for producing thin\nsheets, often referred to as tapes, for use in manufacturing oxygen membranes, dielectrics for capacitors, etc., a\nslurry is laid in a thin sheet and dried. The dried sheet\nhas the consistency of rubber, and is then placed on a\nsurface where it is heat treated in an oven, where it\nbecomes brittle. During such heat treating, the tape or\nmembrane shrinks. It is necessary to hold down the\nmembrane during heat treating, or else it will curl away\nfrom the surface and will not have a flat or predetermined curved shape which is required in a particular\napplication. A vacuum hold-down device is effective in\nholding the membrane to a predetermined configuration such as in a flat sheet, but it was found that the sheet\nwould develop tears as it tended to shrink while being\nf m l y held by a vacuum against a support surface.\nIn accordance with the present invention, creep of\nthe workpiece 12 is permitted while it continues to be\nheld to the support surface 14 by vacuum. The multiplicity of holes 18 in the upper wall 16 of the device is\narranged in a plurality of zones. In FIGS. 1 and 2,the\nholes are arranged in four zones 41-44 that are in the\nform of circles or rings at different spacings from a\ncenter or axis 46 of the device. The holes in each zone\nare coupled to a corresponding one of the plenums\n31-34 by a corresponding one of the four conduits\n21-24. Each of the conduits is coupled through a valve\nmeans or device 50 to the vacuum source 26.The valve\ndevice 50 operates to interrupt or relieve the vacuum at\nthe holes in at least some of the zones, so the pressure\nunder the workpiece in each such relieved zone is substantially equal to atomospheric pressure, or ambient\npressure where the furnace is at other than atmospheric\npressure. Such vacuum relief allows the portion of the\nworkpiece in the relieved zone to creep, either radially\ninwardly or outwardly.\nBy alternating the vacuum relieved zones among\nmost or all of the zones, such creeping can progress\nacross substantially the entire area of the thin workpiece, to allow it to change dimensions. The fact that\nthe vacuum continues to be applied to some of the zone\nwhile one or more of the others is relieved, results in the\nworkpiece being held down to the surface at a location\nnear the relieved zone, so that the workpiece cannot\ncurl or bend more than a very small distance away from\n\n3\n\n4,721,462\n\n4\n\nthe support surface at the relieved zone. Then, when the\nThus, the invention provides a vacuum hold-down\nvacuum is reapplied to the previously relieved zone, the\ndevice which permits a thin workpiece to undergo a\ndimensional change in its width and/or length, espeworkpiece is again held down to the support surface at\nthat zone. By repeatedly altering the relieved zone,\ncially as the temperature of the workpiece changes, to\ncreeping can continue throughout heat treating, to pro- 5 avoid tearing or wrinkling of the workpiece. This is\nduce a workpiece whose shape closely conforms to that\naccomplished by repeatly relieving the vacuum at difof the support surface, but which can be free of tears\nferent zones at different times during the change in\nand wrinkles.\ndimensions of the workpiece.\nIn FIG. 2, the valve 50 includes a blocking member\nAlthough particular embodiments of the invention\n52 that rotates in a direction 54, to relieve the pressure 10 have been described and illustrated herein, it is recogin conduit 24, then conduit 23, then conduit 229 and\nnized Ehat modifications and variations may readily\nfinally conduit 21. Thus, the relief zone progresses radioccur to those skilled in the art9 and consequently, it is\nally inwardly to permit the workpiece to shrink radially\nintended that the claims be interpreted to cover such\ninwardly towards the axis 46.It may be noted that since\nmodifications and equivalents.\nthe centermost zone 41 is at the center, it may not be 15 What is claimed is:\nnecessary to repeatedly relieve the vacuum thereat.\n1 A vacuum hold down apparatus for holding a thin\n.\nworkpiece comprising:\nWhen the valve member 52 is blocking a particular\nconduit such as 23, air from the outside 56 is allowed to\na wall which forms a support surface defining a pluleak into the plenum 33 through a small leakage hole 58\nrality of zones, said wall having a plurality of holes\nleading from the environment at the same pressure as 20\nwith at least one hole in each of said zone;\nthe area above the workpiece, into the plenum 33.
