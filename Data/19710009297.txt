BY applying step pulses\noscillator and directional pulses to one of the flip-flops, 25\nthe motor is made to move in one direction or the other.\nThis invention described herein was made by an employee\nthe United States Government and may be 30\nmanufactured and wed by Or for the Government for\ngovernmental purposes without the payment of any\nroyalties thereon or therefor.\nBACKGROUND O F THE INVENTION\nStepping motors have found widespread use in various\nenvironments. They are used to control the movement\nof plural contacts in switches so that various predetermined circuit connections can be made. Stepping motors\nare also used to control various mechanical movements\nin machines. In addition, stepping motors are used on\nboard space vehicles to perfoim many functions, such\nas pointing a telescope or moving a spectrometer, for\nexample.\nVarious prior art means have been proposed and are\nin use for controlling the stepping action of stepping\nmotors. The most widely used prior art means excite each\nwinding of the stepping motor in sequence directly from\na DC power source. The primary disadvantage of this\nmeans is that it makes inefficient use of the motor windings. In addition, the stepping motor must be specially\nwound if the DC voltage source is on standard DC voltage source. A further disadvantage of this type of prior\nart means is that large peak currents flow because the\nmotors are generally operated by low voltage level amplifiers. Moreover, the peak currents usually flow in unbalanced common return lines during the excitation of\nthe motor windings and introduce noise into the amplifiers. Noise may cause erroneous motor stepping action.\n~ u r t h e r ,because a direct connection between the D c\nvoltage soulce and the wlndings 1s used, there is no way\nto obtain condrritlve rrolaiiorl betvieen rhc Iow level Ini-itlt\nsignal to the motor control ~ircliitzild the ~ l i t p power\n~t\napplied to the motor. And, wrillotit rsoldtion, the low\nlevel circuits in the overall system are vulnerable to nol-e (,i\nfrom the power bus and the common power return.\nTherefore, lt is an object of thls Invention to prov~de\na new and improved stepping motor control circuit.\nIt is also an object of this invention to provide a new\nand improved stepping motor control circuit wherein the\nwindings of the motor are not directly connected to the\nDC power source.\n\n3,532,948\nPatented Oct. 6 , 1070\n\nIt is a fuither object of ihis irrvenriori 10 urovide a new\nand improved stepping motor control circuit wherein the\nD C voltage can vary over a predetermined range without adversely affecting the operation of the stepping\nmotor.\nIt is another object of this invention to provide a new\nand improved stepping motor control circuit that has\nbetter noise immunity than prior art circuits.\nIt is a still further object of this invention to provide\na stepping motor control circuit having isolatibn between the input signal to the control circuit and the\noutput power applied to the motor.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn accordance with a principle of this invention, an\napparatus for controlling a stepping motor is provided.\nThe apparatus includes a core array module that senses\nand "remembers" the prior direction of motor movement.\nThe apparatus also includes flip-flops for sensing the remembered state of the cores of the core array module\nand for sensing input signals. The flip-flops, through\nappropriate amplifying and gating means, control the\napplication of power to the\nwinding? so that the\nmotor steps forward or backward upon the receipt of\nappropriate directional and stepping pulses.\nIn accordance with another princi~leof this invention.\nthe core array module includes a plbality of linear and\na plurality of non-linear cores.\nIn accordance with a further principle of this invention, the flip-flops are connected so as to be immune\nfrom noise, thereby preventing noise from creating false\nstepping signals.\nIn accordance with yet another princi~leof this invention, bidirectional current is pGovideh so that all\nmotor (windings may be driven simultaneously to allow\nthe motor to operate in a forward or reverse direction\nfrom a uni-directional DC power supply.\nIt will be appreciated from the foregoing summary\nof the invention that an apparatus for controlling the\ndirection of movement of a stepping motor that overcomes the problems of prior art apparatus is provided.\nThe system has inherent reliability due to the use of magnetic logic and memory circuits in the form of a core\narray module. In addition, because the actual motor\nwinding current is sensed to determine the state of the\njust prior motor excitation, i.e., the last direction of\nmovement, a still more reliable system is provided. Further, because the system is isolated, coupling from adjacent circuits in an overall systein is reduced. Furthermore, the invention operats so as to use a non standard\nDC voltage source to control a standard stepping motor.\nThis flexibility is provided without sacrificing efficiency\nin the voltage conversion necessary for motor operation.\nIn addition, the system provides immediate motor reversal upon the application of the first stepping pulse\nfollowing a change in direction input.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe fo~egoingobjects and many of thc attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appieciated as the same becomes better understood by\nto the ioliowing cietnile~descrIpiioll wilen\ntaken\nthe acGompanylne\n:vhc-reln.\nFIGS. l a and ih ~ilustratea partially block and partially schematic diagram of a preferred embodiment of\nthe invention;\nFIG. 2 is a legend for FIGS.

The foregoing operative embodiment required each\nwinding to have 30 milliamperes so that a total of 240\nmilliampere-turns is on the selected core, l-his\nof excitation switched the cores in about 5 mic~oseconds~\n35\n~h~ core array module 13 of the embodiment of the\ninvention illustrated in the figure operates in the following manner: first assume that the motor has been driven\non the preceding step and one of the B motor windings. 40\nfour current cornbinations was applied to the A\nFurther, assume that the currents through the ~1 and\n~2 windings were from the left to the right as the windings are illustrated in the figure. under these conditions\nthere is an excitation of 240 milliampere turns into the\nnon-dot ends of the windings on core AB, a net excita- 45\ntion of 0 on cores XB and AB and a net excitation of\n240 milliampere turns into the dot ends of the windings\non core dB.\nThis particular current combination only switches core\nremanent state to produce an Output\nAB to the\nsignal when a readout impulse is applied to the W3 windings\' The flux in the Other \'Ores remain in the same\nremanent state as that produced by the W3 readout winding.\n55\nIt\nbe understood from Ihe\nset forth in\nthe preceding paragraph that for the other three possible\ncurrent combinations, the flux in only one core switches\nfor each combination. Hence, the core array module effectively stores motor current polarity information in one\nof the four non-linear cores. The selected core remains\nin its state of information storaye indefinitely, ready to\nbe switched when the next readout puise is appiied to the\nW3 windings.\nm e n a readout pulse appears on the W3 windings, 65\nthe previously selec\'icd core switches and a pulse is produced on tire W4 and W5 oiitptrl windings tin that c o r e\nThis prrise carices a current Aow in one of lire two lines.\ni.e.~\nW4 Or W5. The line\nis determined by the\nstate of FF-C at the time of the readorit. For example,\nif core ~ 1 is switched, there is a choice of producing\n3\nar?d E or A and E: depending\noutputs on linear cores\nupon the desired direction of motor rotation. The direction of motor rotation is determined by the condition of\nFF-C. That is, FF-C controls the charge on C5 and C6 15\n\nx,\n\n8\nwhich in turn controls itre liow t l i ~ o t ~ pW4 or W5 J i i e to\nil\nthe passage of current through the ckiodes D4 and B5 for\nthe AB switching condition. The other non-linear core\noutputs operate in a sinliiar manner to place FF-A and\nFF-B in the proper states to rotate thc motor one step in\neither direction.\nThe choke L1 limits the current that flows when the\nnoise flux switches in the three unselected non-linear cores\nduring thc readout interval. Preferably, the value of this\ninductor is chosen to be just large enough t o present a\nhigh impedance load to all of the unselected cores during\nthe noise flux switching interval bat, small enough not to\neRect the switching of the total flux in the selected core.\nThe use of the choke results in a greatly reduced amplitude of noise voltage on the outputs of the linear cores.\nFor example, it has been found that the signal and noise\np~llse outputs from the linear core measured six volts,\n1.0 microsecond and 0.5 volt, 0.4 microsecond, respectively, with the choke. The noise voltage was 2 volts, 0.5\nmicrosecond vlit\'lout the choke.\nIn the actual embodiment of the invention previously\ndiscussed, the non-linear cores were formed of commercially available 0.000125 in. thick hlo-permalloy tape\nwound on a stainless steel bobbin toroid core measuring\n0.2 in. outside diameter and 0.094 in. inside diameter and\n0.105 in. high, exhibiting a total flux (-B, to +B,) of\n22 maxwells with a noise flux of less than 4% of this\nvalue. All of the flux in a core of this nature switches in\n10 n~icrosecondswith an excitation of 150 milliampereturns. For the same embodiment, the four linear cores\nwere formed of commercially available 0.0005 in. thick\nMo-Permalloy tape wound on a stainless steel bobbin\ntoroid core measuring 0.2 in. outside diameter, 0.094 in.\ninside diameter and 0.105 in. high exhibiting a total noise\nflux (Br to Bm) maxwells. All of the flux in a core of this\nnature switches in 1.0 microsecond with an excitation of\n240\nThe system illustrated in FIGS. l a and l b operates in\nthe following manner: when power is applied FF-A,\nFF-B, and FF-C come up in one or the other of their\ntwo states. Thereafter, FF-C is ~ u l s e d applying a pulse\nby\nto either input terminal 55 or 57 to give a desired rotational direction. Then, a step pulse is applied to the motor\nstepping input terminal 53 which triggers the blocking\noscillator 1 and the first amplifier 12. For the foregoing\n1\nexample of winding turns and energy levels for the core\narray module, the input step pulse triggers the blocking\noscillator 1 and first amplifier 12 "on" for 5 microsec1\nonds. The output of the first amplifier 12 switches one of\nthe cores in the non-linear array that was previously\nswitched by the pulse currents through the motor windings\nduring the preceding step of the motor as hereinabove\ndescribed. Switching that core produces an output on two\nof the four linear cores (the pair selected depends upon\nthe state of FF-C) and places FF-A and FF-B into the\nrequired states to produce the proper voltage polarities\nfor the motor windings to\n*he desired\ndirection of rotation.\nthe end of the five microseconds,\nFF-D, which is a motor drive pulse width\nflip-flop\nis reset.\nResetting of FF-D causes the first gate 1 4 to open\nLvhich starts the oscillator and applies an input\nto the second. third, fourth, and fifttl amplifiers 19, 21,\n23, and 25. Opening of the first gate 14 also furnishes\na 1 9 bins ;he second, tliird, lourih and fifth e,iCes 27,\n~\n29; 31 and 31. Two of\nsecond\nfii:h\nare gated or] by the comhirreci outputs of tilt: first gate 14\nand FF-A and FF-R. The output of lllese amy.lifcrs is\nan-Iplified\nand rectified by tile\nf:ower amplifier\nand rectifiers.The power\nand rectilciersdrive the\ntran,is(or switches so that voltages of Given polarities are\napplied to the motor viindings A and B.\nThe excitation of winding A and winding R causes\nthe nlotor to step and, at the same time, switches current\nthrough the VJ1 and W2 windings of the non-linear cores\n\n3,532,948\n9\nthe cere array rnodn!e. The cwrent iiow throilgh the\nVVl and W2 windings ideniifies which orie of the four\npossible pulse combinations has just been applied lo the\nmotor. This pulse combination is stored in the manner\nheretofore discussed. The stored information is used to\nswitch two of the four lilnear cores in the core array\nmodule to set up FF-A and FF-B when the cycle is\nrepeated for the next motor step. The particular pair of\nlinear cores that are switched when the next step occurs\ndepends upon the state of the motor direction flip-flop\nFF-C at the time of application of that step pulse.\nThe duration of the motor excitation pulse depends\nprimarily on the time constant of RC circuit 20, the magnitude of the reference voltage at the junction between\nR14 and R17 and the magnitude of the +V5 source. 15\nRectifiers D l 7 and D l 8 provide a feedback voltage to RC\ncircuit 20 comprising RZ6 and C13. As the feedback\nvoltage increases, C13 charges to the comparison voltage\nmore quickly and results in a shortening of the duration\nof the motor excitation pulse. For example, the circuit 20\nmay be set up initially so that the motor steps p r o p e r l ~\nwith a +V5 voltage of 16 volts. Then, as this voltage\nincreases, the motor drive pulse width decreases linearly\nto provide a means of maintaining a constant energy\ninput to the motor. The clamp 18 conilected to RC cir- 25\ncuit 20 returns the voltage across the capacitor to zero\nat the end of each drive pulse. Hence, the clamp establishes the same reference voltage at the beginning of each\ntime interval, regardless of the stepping rate.\nIt \\vili be appreciated from the foregoing description 30\nthat the invention operates from a power source (+V5)\n22\nfor\nthat may vary Over a wide\nvolts. Even though it varies over this range, the energy\ninput to the motor maintains constant level thereby allowing the motor to be used efficiently.\n35\nPreferably, in the example of an actual embodiment\nof the invention heretofore discussed, the isolated power\nsupplies (i.e., +V1, +V2, +V3, and +V4) are 5 volts.\nOf course, any voltage that is compatible with the choice\nof resistors, capacitors and transistors could be used. 40\nThe power amplifier and rectifiers operate from the noisy\n+V5 power suppl~r(i.e., the one that fluctuates over a\nrange, such as 16 to 22 volts, for example). In order to\nmaintain the isolation of the 5 volt supplies, it is preferred\nto trigger the blocking oscillator 1 and the set and 45\n1\nreset inputs of FF-C through isolation transformers,\nespecially if these signals are to be conducted over a\nlong distance.\nThe second, third, fourth and fifth gates controlling\nthe second, third, fourth and fifth amplifiers are, as illus- 50\ntrated and heretofore described, made up of transistors\nwith their emitters connected together and returned\nthrough the first gate consisting of Q3. This manner of\nconnection places the common emitter return of the\namplifier transistors Q8 and Q9 through the coilector to s~\nemitter resistance of two transistors in series. If a 50\nkHz. signal is generated by the osciIlator and applied\nto the base of the amplifier transistors, it will not appear\nacross the T%.\nprimary winding unless both of the seriesconnected gate transistors Q3 and Q1O are on. Because\nthe oscillator common return is also connected to the\ncollector of Q3, power required by the oscillator, gates\nand amplifiers is only consumed when it is needed, i.e.,\nduring the duration of the motor pulse.\nT 2 serves to col~cluciively\nisolate the -+VL ihrcjugh c ; j\n+V4 sonrces from the noisy conlmon and lo irnpcdcnce\nmatch the oscillator signal from the amplifier siages to\nthe power nnrplifier portion of the power amplifiers and\nrectifiers. In order to minimize the capacitive co~pling\nbetween the windings of these transformers, the second- 70\nary winding is preferably segment-wound from the primary windings. This method of construction eliminates\nmost of the siray coupling between the windings, however, there may still be a very small differentiated signal\npresent in the secondary winding even with the gate tran- 75\n11\n\n1\n0\nsistor of!\'. This sigaa!, if it exists, is catrsed b y the f::si\nrise and fall time of the oscillator square wave appearing across the primary and coupling through the smaH\nremaining primary to secondary capacitance. This signal is eliminated by Imgthening the rise and fall time of\nthc oscillator square wave with C-14.\nThe following is a description of a single step of motor\noperation. The step is described by tracing the sequence\nof events from the application of the motor stepping input\npulse at terminal 53 to the termination of the motor\nexcitation pulse width. A step pulse is applied to the\nblocking oscillator input terminal 53 and causes Q1 to\nconduct until the core of T 1 saturates. This period may\nbe 5 microseconds, for example. When Q l conducts, it\napplies a positive signal to the base of Q2 which causes\nQ2 to conduct and connect the W3 windings of the core\narray module to the isolated common return. If it is\nassumed that the motor has been pulsed o n the preceding step with currents in the W2 windings from right to\nleft and the W1 windings from left to right, the flux in\nthe core of A B has been reset. When the W3 windings\nare connected to the isolated common through Q2, a\ncurrent flows from the positive of C3 through the W3\nwindings and back to the isolated common. The flux\nin the core of AB switches and a voltage appears across\nthe w4 and ~5 windings of AB.\n~ i t ~4 ~ ~~5 energizes two of the w8 windings,\nh or\ndepending upon the desired motor direction. If it is as,\nsumed that FF-C is in the appropriate state to reverse\nhias DT, then D6 is zero biased and a pulse of current\n\nin the W8 windings of B and B. This current\ncauses a voltage to be produced on the output windings\nof Zi: and B, i.e., on the WBO windings of the Zi: and B\nlinear cores. Hence, FF-A and FF-B are reset. Resetting\nand FF-B causes the Zi: and\nOutputs\nthese\nflip-flops to become positive and Q I O of gate 29 and Q10\ngate 33 to turn on. Preferably, all of the foregoing\noperations occur during the first microsecond of the 5\nmicrosecond operation of the blocking oscillator ~ u l s e .\nAt the end of the\nthe\nof\nthe blocking oscillator causes FF-D to be reset and fi\nbecomes positive. When 5 becomes positive, the first\ngate transistor 4 3 conducts and connects the return of\nthe oscillator to the isolated common and returns the\nemitters of Q10 of the other gates to the isolated common. This operation applies an oscillator signal to the\ninput of the second, third, fourth and fifth amplifiers,\nhowever, only the third and fifth amplifiers respond because only their Q8 and Q9 transistors are returned to\nthe isolated common. The third and fifth amplifiers drive\ntheir respective amplifiers and rectifiers so that an oscillator frequency square wave voltage appears on the secondaries of their saturable transformers T3. This voltage is rectified by diodes D l 3 and D l 4 to provide a\nnegative D C voltage to the sides of windings A and B\nto which these diodes are connected. Diodes D l 5 and\nD l 6 supply a negative voltage between the emitter and\nthe base of switch transistors Q13 which turns these transistors on and connects a positive polarity voltage through\nthe W1 and W% windings of the core array module and\nthrough the center taped primaries back to the other\nterminals of winding A and winding B. This connectiorl\nresults in the application of a DC voltage polarity to the\n"OiOE\' windings and causes the motor to step.\nThe third secontiaxy winding of T 3 provides a sqilarc\nwave voltage that is rectified by Dl7 and D l 8 and applied as a voliage across the RC circuit 20.\nThe absolute value of this voltage depends upon the\nactual value of the +V5 voltage applied to the primary\nwinding of the T3 transformers. C13 charges through\nR26 until the voltage across it rises to a value slightly\nlarger than the reference voltage at the junction between\nR14 and R17. When this condition occurs, Q6 begins\nto conduct and Q4 is turned on. Turning on Q4 causes\n\n3,53,\n948\n\n11\nFF-D to be set which closes the i i i c r pair fransf\\tor Q3\nto stop the oscilIator and termmate the motor excitation.\nA positive voltage is applied to the bace of Q7 when\nFF-D is set v~hlch\ndischarges C13 In piepalation foi the\nnext motor stepping pulse.\n5\nIt vviil be appreciated that tlie time required for :he\nvoltage across C43 to reach the reference voltage level\nis a function of the feedback voltage, i.e., the higher this\nvoltage, the shoiter the time. This manner of opelation\nresults in the application of a relatively constant energy\nper step to the motor even thou& the +V5 voltage level\nvaries. It is also obvious that the length of the pulse with\na given power supply volage may be adjusted by changing the value of the reference voltage applied to the base\nof 44. D12 is included in the circuit for temperature 15\ncompensation, i.e., this diode changes the ieference voltage in the same direction and amount as reciifier diodes\nDl7 and D l 5 change the feedback voltage with ambient\ntemperatures variations. ZD1 and ZD2 are included in\nthe system to prevent transient voltages from occurring 20\nand destroying the transistor switches 413.\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, a frequency of 50 kHz. was chosen for the oscillator f ~ e quency in order to be able to use small size transformers\nand keep the weight of the ove~allunit to a minimum. 25\nIn that embodiment, the core of T2 is a ferrite toroid\nmeasuring 0.375 inch outside diameter, 0.188 inch inside diameter, and 0.125 inch thick. The coie of T3 is\na \'/z mil thick Mo-pe~malloytape wound on a stainless\nsteel bobbin toioid measuring 0.320 inch outside diam- 30\neter, 0.134 inch inside diameter and 0.160 inch thick. The\nefficiency of the overall circuit using items having the\ndimensions herein described operating from a 16 to 22\nvolt power supply was found to be 80%.\nI t will be appreciated from the foregoing description 35\nthat the invention provides an apparatus for controlling\nthe stepping of a stepping motor that has various advantages over prioi art apparatus. For example, the apparatus\nhas low stand-by power and conductive isolation between\nhigh and low voltage circuits. That is there is isolation 40\nbetween the high level +V5 circuits and the low level\n+VB to +V4 circuits. In addition, constant energy pulse\nexcitation can be applied over a wide range of +V5 voltages. Moleover, the circuit is inherently reliable due t o\nthe use of magnetic logic and memory circuits. Further, 45\nthe invention distinguishes over the prior art because it\nuses the actual motor winding current to determine the\nphase of motor excitation, making the sensing and powering circuits integral rather than separate. In addition,\nbalanced and isolated power excitation to the motor re- 50\ndnces noise coupling between adjacent circuits in an overall system that includes a stepping motor controlled by\nthis invention. Finally, there is immediate reversal of\nmotor direction upon the application of the first step\n55\nwlse following a change in direction input pulse.\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and\notheis that the foregoing has described a preferred embodiment of the invention, however, other embodiments\nof the invention fall within the scope of the description.\nFor example, the invention could be extended to excite 60\nmotors of any number of phases rather than just two\nrsbases.
