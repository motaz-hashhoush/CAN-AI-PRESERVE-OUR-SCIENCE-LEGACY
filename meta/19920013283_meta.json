In general, the sensors are used either to measure to response of an engine component to the imposed environment. Locations of concern are generally within the gas path and, for the most part, are within the hot section of the engine. Since these sensors are used for research testing as opposed to operational use, a sensor lifetime of the order of 50 hr is considered sufficient. The following discussion presents a sample of this work, describing programs to develop a dynamic gas temperature measuring system, total heat flux sensors, a variety of thin-film sensors, and high-temperature strain measuring systems.", "title": "Research sensors", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920013283, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Englund, David R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "4f4c8d719aad44e480e9996344b2f18e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920013283, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920013283, "id": "43a2977d2c7140388a86354e98706de0", "publicationName": "Aeropropulsion 1987", "publicationDate": "1990-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920013283.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920013283/downloads/19920013283.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920013283/downloads/19920013283.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920013283/downloads/19920013283.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
