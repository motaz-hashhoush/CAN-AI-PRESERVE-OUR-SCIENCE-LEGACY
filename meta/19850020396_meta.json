The turbulence is presumed to vary only along the flight path of the vehicle but not across the vehicle span. The addition of the realism of three-dimensionality is a worthy goal, but any such attempt will not gain acceptance in the simulator community unless it is computationally efficient. A concept for adding three-dimensional realism with a minimum of computational complexity is presented. The concept involves the use of close rational approximations to irrational spectra and cross-spectra so that systems of stable, explicit difference equations can be used to generate the turbulence.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850020396, "id": "81d065465a364a81a5a844acc47a524d", "publicationDate": "1985-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850020396.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850020396/downloads/19850020396.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850020396/downloads/19850020396.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850020396/downloads/19850020396.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
