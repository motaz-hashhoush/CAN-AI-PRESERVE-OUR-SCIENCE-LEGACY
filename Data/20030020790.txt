b'Finite volume met hods: foundation and analysis\nTimothy Barth\xe2\x80\x99 and Mario Ohlberger2\nN A S A Ames Research Center, Information Sciences Directorate, Moffett Field, California, 94035, USA\nInstitute of Applied Mathematics, Freiburg University, Hermann-Herder-Str. 10, 79104 h i b u r g , Germany\nand CSCAMM, University of Maryland, 4127 CSIC Building, College Park, Maryland, 20742-3289, USA\n\nABSTRACT\nFinite volume methods are a class of discretization schemes that have proven highly successful in\napproximating the solution of a wide variety of conservation law systems. They are extensively used\nin fluid mechanics, porous media flow, meteorology, electromagnetics, models of biological processes,\nsemi-conductor device simulation and many other engineering areas governed by conservative systems\nthat can be written in integral control volume form.\nThis article reviews elements of the foundation and analysis of modern finite volume methods.\nThe primary advantages of these methods are numerical robustness through the obtention of discrete\nmaximum (minimum) principles, applicability on very general unstructured meshes, and the intrinsic\nlocal conservation properties of the resulting schemes. Throughout this article, specific attention is\ngiven to scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws and the development of high order accurate\nschemes for discretizing them. A key tool in the design and analysis of finite volume schemes suitable for\nnon-oscillatory discontinuity capturing is discrete maximum principle analysis. A number of building\nblocks used in the development of numerical schemes possessing local discrete maximum principles are\nreviewed in one and several space dimensions, e.g. monotone fluxes, E-fluxes, TVD discretization, nonoscillatory reconstruction, slope limiters, positive coefficient schemes, etc. When available, theoretical\nresults concerning a priori and a posteriori error estimates are given. Further advanced topics are then\nconsidered such as high order time integration, discretization of dffision terms and the extension to\nsystems of nonlinear conservation laws.\nKEY WORDS: finite volume methods, conservation laws, non-oscillatory approximation, discrete\nmaximum principles, higher order schemes\n\nContents\n\n1 Introduction: Scalar nonlinear conservation laws\n1.1 Characteristics of scalar conservation laws . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.2 Weaksolutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.3 Entropy weak solutions and vanishing viscosity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n1.4 Measure-valued or entropy process solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n2 Finite volume (FV) methods for nonlinear conservation laws\n2.1 Godunov finite volume discretizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n2.1.1 Monotone schemes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n....\n....\n\n2\n\n.\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n10\n\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.

An essential feature of nonlinear conservation laws is that, in\ngeneral, gradients of u blow up in finite time, even when the initial data uo is arbitrarily\nsmooth. Beyond some critical time to classical solutions of (la-lb) do not exist. This behavior\nwill be demonstrated using the method of characteristics. By introducing the notion of weak\nsolutions of (la-lb) together with an entropy condition, it then becomes possible t o define\na class of solutions where existence and uniqueness is guaranteed for times greater than to.\nThese are precisely the solutions that are numerically sought in the finite volume method.\n1.1. Characteristics of scalar conservation laws\n\nLet u be a classical solution of (la) subject to initial data (lb). Further, define the vector\n\nA characteristic ry is a curve (x(t),t) such that\nz \' ( t ) = a ( u ( z ( t ) , t ) ) for t\nx(0) = y .\n\n>O ,\n\nSince u is assumed to be a classical solution, it is readily verified that\n\nd\n- u ( x ( t ) , t ) = atu + x\'(t)Vu = atu + a(u)Vu= atu + v . f (u) 0 .\n=\ndt\nTherefore, u is constant along a characteristic curve and\n\nis a straight line since\n\nz \' ( t ) = a ( u ( s ( t )t,) ) = a(u(x(O), = a(u(y,0)) = a(uo(y)) = const .\n0))\nIn particular x ( t ) is given by\n4 t >= y\n\n+ ta(uo(y)).\n\nThis important property may be used to construct classical solutions. If x is fixed and y\ndetermined as a solution of (2), then\n\nu ( x , t ) = \'ILo(Y) .\nThis procedure is the basis of the so-called method of characteristics. On the other hand,\nthis construction shows that the intersection of any two straight characteristic lines leads to a\ncontradiction in the definition of u(x,) . Thus, classical solutions can only exist up to the first\nt\ntime t o at which any two characteristics intersect.\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.

Weak solutions\nSince, in general, classical solutions only exist \xe2\x82\xacor a finite time to,it is necessary to introduce\nthe notion of weak solutions that are well-defined for times t > t o .\nDefinition 1.1 (Weak solution) Let uo E L w ( R d ) . Then, u is a weak solution of (la-lb)\ni f u E Lw(Rd x I%+) and (la-lb) hold in the distributional sense, i.e.\n\nWd W+\n\nWd\n\nNote that classical solutions are weak solutions and weak solutions that lie in C1(Rdx R+)\nsatisfy (la-lb) in the classical sense.\nIt can be shown (see Kruzkov, 1970; Oleinik, 1963) that there always exists at least one\nweak solution to (la-lb) if the flux function f is at least Lipschitz continuous. Nevertheless,\nthe class of weak solutions is too large to ensure uniqueness of solutions. An important class of\nsolutions are piecewise classical solutions with discontinuities separating the smooth regions.\nThe following lemma gives a necessary and sufficient condition imposed on these discontinuities\nsuch that the solution is a weak solution (see for example Godlewski and Raviart, 1991; Kroner,\n1997). Later a simple example is given where infinitely many weak solutions exist.\nLemma 1.2 (Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition) Assume that Rd x R+ is separated by\na smooth hypersurface S into two parts Rr and R,. Furthermore, assume u i s a C1-function\no n 01and G,., respectively. Then, u is a weak solution of (la-lb) i f and only i f the following\ntwo conditions hold:\ni) u is a classical solution in 0 and R,, respectively.\n1\nai) u satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, i.e.\n[u]s = [f(u)]\n.v\n\non S .\n\n(4)\n\nHere, (v,- s ) ~denotes a unit normal vector f o r the hypersurface S and [w] denotes the jump\nin w across the hypersurface S .\nIn one space dimension, it may be assumed that S is parameterized by (c(t),t)\nsuch that\ns = u\xe2\x80\x99(t) and v = 1. The Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition then reduces to\n\nExample 1.3 (Non-uniqueness of weak solutions) Consider the one-dimensional Bwgers\xe2\x80\x99 equation, f(u) u 2 / 2 , with Riemann data: uo(x) = u f o r x < 0 and U O ( X ) = u, f o r\n=\n1\nx 2 0.

This is easily checked since u is\nu\npiecewise constant and satisfies the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition. This elucidates a onei\nparameter family of weak solutions. In fact, there is also 0 classical solution whenever u ur .\n\n<\n\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics. Edited by Erwin Stein, Ren.6 de Borst and Thomas J.R.

Consequently,\nadditional conditions must be introduced in order to single out one solution within the class\nof weak solutions. These additional conditions give rise to the notion of a unique entropy weak\nsolution.\n\n{\n\n1.3. Entropy weak solutions and vanishing viscosity\nIn order to introduce the notion of entropy weak solutions, it is useful to first demonstrate\nthat there is a class of additional conservation laws for any classical solution of (la). Let u be\na classical solution and 7 : R -+ R a smooth function. Multiplying (la) by ~ \xe2\x80\x98 ( u ) , obtains\none\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0 = ~ \xe2\x80\x99 ( u ) & u ~ \xe2\x80\x99 ( u ) Vf (u)= & q ( ~ ) V .

This reveals that for a classical solution u, the quantity q(u),\nhenceforth called an entropy function, is a conserved quantity.\n\nDefinition 1.4 (Entropy - e n t r o p y flux pair) Let\nand F : R -+ IR a smooth function such that\n\n:R\n\n+ R be a smooth convezfunction\n\nF\xe2\x80\x99 = $f\xe2\x80\x99\n(9)\nin (8). Then (7, ) is called a n entropy - entropy j7ux pair or more simply an entropy pair for\nF\nthe equation ( l a ) .\nNote 1.5 (Kruzkov entropies) The family of smooth convex entropies 11 may be\nequivalently replaced by the non-smooth family of so-called Krmzkov entropies, i.e. qK(u) E\n(u K. I for all K. E R (see Kroner, 1997).\nUnfortunately, the relation (8) can not be fulfilled for weak solutions in general, as it would lead\nto additional jump conditions which would contradict the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition\nlemma. Rather, a weak solution may satisfy the relation (8) in the distributional sense with\ninequality.

Measure-valued or entropy process solutions\nThe numerical analysis of conservation laws requires an even weaker formulation of solutions to\n(la-lb).

Finite volume (FV) methods for nonlinear conservation laws\nIn the finite volume method, the computational domain, R c Etd, is first tessellated into a\ncollection of non overlapping control volumes that completely cover the domain. Notationally,\nlet 7 denote a tessellation of the domain R with control volumes T E 7 such that U T ~ T F E.\n=\nLet hT denote a length scale associated with each control volume T , e.g. hT 5 diam(T). For\ntwo distinct control volumes T and Tj in 7 ,the intersection is either an oriented edge (2-D)\ni\nor face (3-D) eij with oriented normal vij or else a set of measure at most d - 2. In each control\nvolume, an integral conservation law statement is then imposed.\n\nDefinition 2.1 (Integral conservation law) An integral conservation law asserts that the\nrate of change of the total amount of a substance with density u in a fixed control volume T is\nequaZ to the flux f of the substance through the boundary dT\n\nThis integral conservation law statement is readily obtained upon spatial integration of the\ndivergence equation (la) in the region T and application of the divergence theorem. The\nchoice of control volume tessellation is flexible in the finite volume method. For example, Fig.\n\n0\n\nstorage location\ncontrol volume\n\na. Cell-centered\n\nb. Vertex-centered\n\nFigure 1.

Error estimates and convergence rates. There are two primary approaches taken to\nobtain error estimates for approximations of scalar nonlinear conservation laws. One approach\nis based on the ideas of Oleinik and is applicable only in one space dimension (see Oleinik,\n1963; Tadmor, 1991). T h e second approach which is widely used in the numerical analysis of\nconservation laws is based on the doubling of variables technique of Kruzkov (see Kruzkov,\n1970; Kuznetsov, 1976). In essence, this technique enables one t o estimate the error between\nthe exact and approximate solution of a conservation law in terms of the entropy residual\nR ( n , u , , @ ) introduced in (44). Thus, an a posteriori error estimate is obtained. Using a\npriori estimates of the approximate solution (see Section 2.2.1, and Theorems 2.9, 2.10),\na convergence rate or an a priori error estimate is then obtained. The next theorem gives\na fundamental error estimate for conservation laws independent of the particular finite\nvolume scheme (see Eymard, Galluoet and Herbin, 2000; Chainais-Hillairet, 1999; Kroner and\nOhlberger, 2000).\nTheorem 2.16 (Fundamental error estimate) Let uo E BV(Rd)and let u be a n entropy\nweak solution of (la-lb).

(ii) TVNI schemes are monotonicity preserving, i.e. the number of solution\nextrema is preserved in time.\n\nProperty (i) follows from the L1 contraction property of monotone schemes. Property (ii) is\nreadily shown using a proof by contradiction by assuming a TVNI scheme with monotone\ninitial data that produces new solution data at a later time with interior solution extrema\npresent.

A general family of TVD discretizations with 5-point stencil is the\nMonotone Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) discretization of van\nLeer, 1979; van Leer, 1985. MUSCL schemes utilize a n-parameter family of interpolation\nformulas with limiter function Q(R) : R I+ R\n\nwhere R is a ratio of successive solution increments\nj\n\nThe technique of incorporating limiter functions to obtain non-oscillatory resolution of\ndiscontinuities and steep gradients dates back to Boris and Book, 1973. For convenience,\nthe interpolation formulas (60) have been written for a uniformly spaced mesh although the\nextension to irregular mesh spacing is straightforward. The unlimited form of this interpolation\nis obtained by setting Q(R) = 1. In this unlimited case, the truncation error for the\nconservation law divergence in (la) is given by\n\na3\n\nTruncation Error = - ____ (Ax)2- f ( u ) .\n(\xe2\x80\x99 4\nax3\nThis equation reveals that for K = 1/3, the l-D MUSCL formula yields an overall spatial\ndiscretization with C?(Az3) truncation error.

Note that in practical\nimplementation, all three limiters (83), (84) and (85) require some modification to prevent\nnear zero division for nearly constant solution data.\n\n3.2.3. Linear reconstruction operators on simplicial control volumes. Linear reconstruction\noperators on simplicial control volumes that satisfy the cell averaging requirement (64b) often\nexploit the fact that the cell average is also a pointwise value of any valid linear reconstruction\nevaluated at the gravity center of a simplex. This reduces the reconstruction problem to that of\ngradient estimation given pointwise samples at the gravity centers. In this case, it is convenient\nto express the reconstruction in the form\n\nRy(x;h ) l T j = uj -k (vuh)Tj.

As was exploited in the linear reconstruction\ntechniques for simplicial control volumes, linear reconstructions satisfying (64b) on general\ncontrol volume shapes are greatly simplified by exploiting the fact that the cell average value\nis also a pointwise value of all valid linear reconstructions evaluated at the gravity center of\na general control volume shape. This again reduces the linear reconstruction problem to that\nof gradient estimation given pointwise values.

(Compact support) The reconstruction in a control volume Tj should only depend of cell\naverages in a relatively small neighborhood surrounding Tj. Recall that a polynomial\nof degree p in Rd contains (":d) degrees of freedom. The support set for Tj is required\nto contain at least this number of neighbors. As the support set becomes even larger\nfor fixed p , not only does the computational cost increase, but eventually the accuracy\ndecreases as less valid data from further away is brought into the calculation.\nPractical implementations of polynomial reconstruction operators fall into two classes:\n0\n\n0\n\nFixed support stencil reconstructions. These methods choose a fixed support set as\na preprocessing step. Various limiting strategies are then employed to obtain nonoscillatory approximation, see for example Barth and Frederickson, 1990; Delanaye, 1996\nfor further details.\nAdaptive support stencil reconstructions. These ENO-like methods dynamically choose\nreconstruction stencils based on solution smoothness criteria, see for example Harten\nand Chakravarthy, 1991; Vankeirsblick, 1993; Abgrall, 1994; Sonar, 1997; Sonar, 1998\nfor further details.\n\n3.2.6. Positive coeficient schemes on unstructured meshes Several related positive coefficient\nschemes have been proposed on multi-dimensional simplicial meshes based on one-dimensional\ninterpolation. The simplest example is the upwind triangle scheme as introduced by Billey\net al., 1987; Desideri and Dervieux, 1988; Rostand and Stoufflet, 1988 with later improved\nvariants given by Jameson, 1993; CournBde, Debiez and Dervieux, 1998. These schemes are\nnot Godunov methods in the sense that a single multi-dimensional gradient is not obtained\nin each control volume. The basis for these methods originates from the gradient estimation\nformula (91) generalized to the calculation of flux divergence on a median dual tessellation.\nIn deriving this flux divergence formula, the ,assumption has been made that flux components\nvary linearly within a simplex yielding the discretization formula\n\nwhere V j k is computed from a median dual tessellation using (90). This discretization is the\nunstructured mesh counterpart of central differencing on a structured mesh. Schemes using\nthis discretization of flux divergence lack sufficient stability properties for computing solutions\nof general nonlinear conservation laws. This lack of stability can be overcome by adding\nsuitable diffusion terms. One of the simplest modifications is motivated by upwind domain\nof dependence arguments yielding the numerical flux\n1\n\ngjk(uj,uk)\n\nwith\n\najk\n\n= T(f(uj) + f ( u k ) )\n\n1\n\n\'Vjk\n\n- Tlaljk Ajku\n\n(92)\n\na mean value (a.k.a.

With suitable modifications of a j k near sonic points, it is then possible\nt o produce a modified numerical flux that is an E-flux for all data, see Osher, 1984.

Further Advanced Topics\nThe material presented in previous sections gives a brief overview of the derivation and analysis\nof finite volume methods. For simplicity and brevity of the presentation, exclusive attention has\nbeen devoted to scalar nonlinear conservation laws in divergence form. In this overview, special\nconsideration has been given to the formulation and stability analysis of higher order accurate\nschemes since these developments have had the largest impact on development of industrial\ncomputer codes in use at the time of this writing. The remainder of this chapter will consider\nseveral extensions of the finite volume method. Section 4.1 considers a class of higher order\naccurate discretizations in time that still preserve the stability properties of the fully-discrete\nschemes using Euler time integration. This is followed by a discussion of generalizations of the\nfinite volume method for problems including second order diffusion terms and the extension\nto systems of nonlinear conservation laws.\n4.1. Higher order tame integration schemes\n\nThe derivation of finite volume schemes in Sect. 2 first yielded a semi-discrete formulation\n(21) that was later extended to a fully-discrete formulation (22) by the introduction of first\norder accurate forward Euler time integration. These latter schemes where then subsequently\nextended to higher order accuracy in space using a variety of techniques. For many computing\nproblems of interest, first order accuracy in time is then no longer enough. To overcome this\nlow order accuracy in time, a general class of higher order accurate time integration methods\nwas developed that preserve stability properties of the fully-discrete scheme with forward Euler\ntime integration. Following Gottlieb, Shu and Tadmor, 2001 and Shu, 2001, these methods will\nbe referred to as Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) time integration methods.\nExplicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods were originally developed by Shu, 1988; Shu and Osher,\n1988 and Gottlieb and Shu, 1998 and called TVD Runge-Kutta time discretizations. In a\nslightly more general approach, total variation bounded (TVB) Runge-Kutta methods were\nconsidered by Cockburn and Shu, 1989; Cockburn, Lin and Shu, 1989; Cockburn, Hou and Shu,\n1990; Cockburn and Shu, 1998 in combination with the discontinuous Galerkin discretization\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.

Kuther, 2000 later gave error estimates for second order TVD Runge-Kutta finite\nvolume approximations of hyperbolic conservation laws.\nTo present the general framework of SSP Runge-Kutta methods, consider writing the semidiscrete finite volume method in the following form\nd\n-U(t) = L ( U ( t ) )\n(93)\ndt\nwhere U = U ( t ) denotes the solution vector of the semi-discrete finite volume method. Using\nthis notation together with forward Euler time integration yields the fully-discrete form\nUnfl = U" - At L(U") ,\n(94)\nwhere U" is now an approximation of U(tn). As demonstrated in Section 2.2, the forward\nEuler time discretization is stable with respect to the Lm-norm, i.e.\n\nIIU"+llloo 5 IlU"Ilm\n\n(95)\n\n7\n\nsubject to a CFL-like time step restriction\n\nAtsAto .\n(96)\nWith this assumption, a time integration method is said to be SSP (see Gottlieb, Shu and\nTadmor, 2001) if it preserves the stability property (95), albeit with perhaps a slightly different\nrestriction on the time step\nAt 5 c At0\n(97)\nwhere c is called the CFL coefficient of the SSP method. In this framework, a general objective\nis to find SSP methods that are higher order accurate, have low computational cost and storage\nrequirements, and have preferably a large CFL coefficient. Note that the TV-B Runge-Kutta\nmethods can be embedded into this class if the following relaxed notion of stability is assumed\n\nllunflllco5 (1 + Q(At))llUnllm .\n\n(98)\n\n4.1.1. Explicit SSP Runge-Kutta methods. Following Shu and Osher, 1988 and the review\narticles by Gottlieb, Shu and Tadmor, 2001; Shu, 2001, a general m stage Runge-Kutta method\nfor integrating (93) in time can be algorithmically represented as\n\nu\n\n-0\n\n:= U"\n\n,\n\n1-1\n\n0 :=\n\'\n\n(alkok\n\n+ at L ( o k ) ) ,\nPlk\n\nCl\'lk\n\n3 0,\n\n1 = 1,..., 772\n\n,\n\n(99)\n\nk=O\n\nUn+l\n\n:= o m .\n\nTo ensure consistency, the additional constraint\n\nall,\n\n= 1 is imposed. If, in addition, all\n\nPlk:are assumed to be non-negative, it is straightforward to see that the method can be written\nas a convex (positive weighted) combination of simple forward Euler steps with At replaced\nby &At. From this property, Shu and Osher, 1988 concluded the following lemma:\n\nLemma 4.1.,If the forward Euler method (94) is Lm-stable subject to the CFL condition (96),\nthen the Rung-Kutta method (99) with ,&k 2 0 is SSP, i.e. the method is Lm-stable under the\ntime step restriction (97) with CFL coefficient\nc = m i n -b l k .\nl,k\n\nalk\n\n(100)\n\nIn the case of negative P l k , a similar result can be proven, see Shu and Osher, 1988.\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.

Gottlieb, Shu\nand Tadmor, 2001 [Proposition 3.11 show that the maximal CFL coefficient for any m-stage, mth order accurate SSP Runge-Kutta methods is c = 1. Therefore, SSP Runge-Kutta methods\nthat achieve c = 1 are termed \xe2\x80\x9coptimal\xe2\x80\x9d. Note that this restriction is not true if the number\nof stages is higher than the order of accuracy, see Shu, 1988.\nOptimal second and third order nonlinear SSP Runge-Kutta methods are given in Shu and\nOsher, 1988.

Discretization of elliptic problems\nFinite volume methods for elliptic boundary value problems have been proposed and analyzed\nunder a variety of different names: box methods, covolume methods, diamond cell methods,\nintegral finite difference methods and finite volume element methods, see Bank and Rose,\n1987; Cai, 1991; Suli, 1991; Lazarov, Michev and Vassilevsky, 1996; Viozat et al., 1998;\nChatzipantelidis, 1999; Chou and Li, 2000; Hermeline, 2000; Eymard, Galluoet and Herbin,\n2000; Ewing, Lin and Lin, 2002.

In addition, the analysis is extended to general elliptic\nproblems in divergence form including convection, reaction and singular source terms.\n\n4.3. Conservation laws including diffusion t e r m s\nAs demonstrated in Sect. 1, hyperbolic conservation laws are often approximations to physical\nproblems with small or nearly vanishing viscosity. In other problems, the quantitative solution\neffects of these small viscosity terms are actually sought. Consequently, it is necessary in these\nproblems to include viscosity terms into the conservation law formulation. As a model for these\nlatter problems, a second order Laplacian term with small diffusion parameter is added to the\nfirst order Cauchy problem, i.e.\n(104a)\n(104b)\nHere u(z, t ) : Rd x R+ + R denotes the dependent solution variable, f E C(R) the hyperbolic\nflux and E 2 0 a small diffusion coefficient. -4pplication of the divergence and Gauss theorems\nto (104a) integrated in a region T yields the following integral conservation law form\n\nat L u d x +\nd\n\nk,\n\nf (u) .du -\n\nA first goal is t o extend the fully-discrete form (22) of Sect. 2 to the integral conservation law\n(105) by the introduction of a numerical diffusion flux function d j k ( u h ) for a control volume\nTj E 7 such that\n\nWhen combined with the general finite volume formulation (22) for hyperbolic conservation\nlaws, the following fully-discrete scheme is produced\n\nIn this equation, the index m may be chosen either as n or n\nor implicit discretization.\n\n+ 1,corresponding to an explicit\n\n4.3.1.

The\nreconstruction using piecewise constant gradients is relatively straightforward if the control\nvolumes are vertex-centered, or if the cell interfaces are perpendicular to the straight lines\nconnecting the storage locations (see Fig. 10).\n\nVertex-centered finite volume schemes.

In the case of cell-centered finite volume schemes where\nan underlying primal-dual mesh relationship may not exist, a simple numerical diffusion flux\ncan be constructed whenever cell interfaces are exactly or approximately perpendicular to the\nstraight lines connecting the storage locations, e.g. Voronoi meshes, quadrilateral meshes, etc.\nIn these cases, the reconstructed gradient of zbh projected normal t o the cell interface ejk can\nbe represented by\n\nwhere xi denotes the storage location of cell Ti.

Utilizing these techniques, convergence of finite volume\nschemes (uniform with respect to E + 0) was proven in Eymard et al., 2002 and a priori\nerror estimates were obtained for viscuous approximations in Jakobsen and Karlsen, 2001 and\nEymard, Gallouet and Herbin, 2002.

Even so, the solution of the Riemann problem is\nboth mathematically and computationally nontrivial. Consequently, a number of alternative\nnumerical fluxes have been proposed that are more computationally efficient. These alternative\nnumerical fluxes can be sometimes interpreted as approximate Riemann solvers. A partial list\nof alternative numerical fluxes is given here. A more detailed treatment of this subject is given\nin Godlewski and Raviart, 1991, Kroner, 1997, and LeVeque, 2002.\n0\n\n0\n\nOsher-Solomon flux (Osher and Solomon, 1982). This numerical flux is a system\ngeneralization of the Enquist-Osher flux of Sect. 2. All wave families are approximated in\nstate space as rarefaction or inverted rarefaction waves with Lipschitz continuous partial\nderivatives. The Osher-Solomon numerical flux is of the form\n\nwhere [AI denotes the usual matrix absolute value. By integrating on m rarefaction\nwave integral subpaths that are each parallel to a right eigenvector, a system decoupling\noccurs on each subpath integration. Furthermore, for the gas dynamic equations with\nideal gas law, it is straightforward to construct m-1 Riemann invariants on each subpath\nthereby eliminating the need for path integration altogether. This reduces the numerical\nflux calculation t o purely algebraic computations with special care taken at sonic points,\nsee Osher and Solomon, 1982.\nRoe flux (Roe, 1981). Roe\xe2\x80\x99s numerical flux can be a interpreted as approximating all\nwaves families as discontinuities. The numerical flux is of the form\n\nv)\nwhere A(v;u, is the \xe2\x80\x9cRoe matrix\xe2\x80\x9d satisfying the matrix mean value identity\n\n(f(v) - f)\n(\n.\n\n.v\n\n= A(v;21, ) (v -).\n.\n\nwith A ( v ;u, = A(v;u). the equations of gas dynamics with ideal gas law, the Roe\nu)\nFor\nmatrix takes a particularly \xe2\x80\x98simpleform. Steady discrete mesh-aligned shock profiles are\nresolved with one intermediate point. The Roe flux does not preclude the formation of\nentropy violating expansion shocks unless additional steps are taken near sonic points.\nSteger-Warming flux vector splitting (Steger and Warming, 1981). Steger and Warming\nconsidered a splitting of the flux vector for the gas dynamic equations with ideal gas\nlaw that exploited the fact that the flux vector is homogeneous of degree one in the\nconserved variables. From this homogeneity property, Euler\xe2\x80\x99s identity then yields that\n\nf(u) v = A ( v ;u) Steger and Warming then considered the matrix splitting\n.\nu.\n\nA = A+ + A - , A* E XA*X-\xe2\x80\x99\nwhere Ah is computed component wise. From this matrix splitting, the final upwind\nnumerical flux function was constructed as\ngsw(u, W ) = A+(v;u) + A-(v; W ) v .\nu\n\nAlthough not part of their explicit construction, for the gas dynamic equations with ideal\nfau has eigenvalues that are all nonnegative and the\ngas law, the jacobian matrix dgSW\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.

The matrix splitting leads to numerical fluxes\nspecific heats y lies in the interval [l,\nthat do not vary smoothly near sonic and stagnation points. Use of the Steger-Warming\nflux splitting in the schemes of Sect. 2 and 3 results in rather poor resolution of linearly\ndegenerate contact waves and velocity slip surfaces due to the introduction of excessive\nartificial diffusion for these wave families.\nVan Leer flux vector splitting. Van Leer, 1982 provided an alternative flux splitting for\nthe gas dynamic equations that produces a numerical flux of the form\ng V L ( w ) = f.\n-)\n(\n\n0\n\n+ f+W\n\nusing special Mach number polynomials to construct fluxes that remain smooth near\nsonic and stagnation points. As part of the splitting construction, the jacobian matrix\ndgsw/bu has eigenvalues that are all nonnegative and the matrix agSw/dv has\neigenvalues that are all nonpositive. The resulting expressions for the flux splitting\nare somewhat simpler when compared to the Steger-Warming splitting. The van Leer\nsplitting also introduces excessive diffusion in the resolution of linearly degenerate contact\nwaves and velocity slip surfaces.\nSystem Lax-Friedrichs flux. This numerical flux is the system equation counterpart of\nthe scalar Lax-Friedrichs flux (27). For systems of conservation laws the Lax-Friedrichs\nflux is given by\n1\n1\nSLF(",V) = Z(f(4 + f(w)) . v (v - I\n.\nwhere a ( v ) is given through the eigenvalues Xk(v; w) of A(v;w)\n\nThe system Lax-F\'riedrichs flux is usually not applied on the boundary of domains since it\ngenerally requires an over specification of boundary data. The system Lax-Friedrichs flux\nintroduces a relatively large amount of artificial diffusion when used in the schemes of\nSect. 2. Consequently, this numerical flux is typically only used together with relatively\nhigh order reconstruction schemes where the detrimental effects of excessive artificial\ndiffusion are mitigated.\nHarten-Lax-van Leer flux (Harten, Lax and van Leer, 1983). The Harten-Lax-van Leer\nnumerical flux originates from a simplified two wave model of more general m wave\nsystems such that waves associated with the smallest and largest characteristic speeds\nof the m wave system are always accurately represented in the two wave model. The\nfollowing numerical flux results from this simplified two wave model\n\nwhere\n\nWhen compared to the Lax-F\'riedrichs flux, this flux can be considerably more accurate\nin flow situations where 0 < I(Qmax Q m i n ) / ( a m a x - a m i n ) [ < 1. Using this flux, full\nupwinding is obtained for supersonic flow. Modifications of this flux are suggested in\nEinfeldt et al., 1998 to improve the resolution of intermediate waves as well.\n\n+\n\nEncyclopedia of Computational Mechanics.
