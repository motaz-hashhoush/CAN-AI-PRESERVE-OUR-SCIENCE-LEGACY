b'Deveiopment of the COMmereial kperiment Transpoder\n(COMEV\nBy Joseph F. Pawlick, Jr.\nAssistant Director for Commercial Space Transportation\nCenter for Advanced Space Propulsion\nNovember &I990\nOverview\n\nIn order to commercialize space, this nation\nmust develop a well defrned path through which the\nCenters for the Commercial Development of Space\n(CCDS\'s) and their industrial partners and\ncounterparts can exploit the advantages of space\nmanufacturing and processing. Such a capability\nrequires systems, a supporting infrastructure, and\nfunding to become a viable component of this\nnation\'s economic strength.\nThis paper follows the development of the\nCOMmercial Experiment Program (COMET) from\ninception to it\'s current position as the country\'s\nfirst space program dedicated to satisfying the needs\nof industry: an industry which must investigate the\nfeasibility of space based processes, materiaIs, and\nprototypes. With proposals now being evaluated,\ns\nmuch of the COMET story i yet to be written,\nhowever concepts and events which led to it\'s\ncurrent status and the plans for implementation may\nbe presented.\n\nFunding for this program was provided by\nNASA Headquarters Office of Commercial\nPrograms through the Center for Advanced Space\nPropulsion Grant NAGW-1195.\n\nT i concept would not have come to\nhs\nfruition were it not for the support of Dr. George\nGarrison, Mr. E.G. Allee and those CCDS\nmembers who make up the COMET team.\nInvaluable assistance was provided by Messrs. N.\nBowles and D. Lang of the Department of\nTransportation\'s Office of Commercial Space\nTransportation.\nProgram Initiation\n\nAt the May, 1989 Quarterly CCDS\nDfectors Meeting, Mr. R. Ott, Director of\'\nCommersial Development Division of the NASA\n\nOffice of Commercial Programs (Code C)\npresented the results of his office\'s investigation into\navailable spaceflight opportunities for CCDS\npayloads. While the short range forecast showed a\nsuitabIe number of flight opportunities, the quantity\nof commercial payloads for the outyears, were seen\nto outstrip Shuttle Get Away Special Canister (GAS\nCans) and mid deck locker availability. Mr. James\nT. Rose, NASA Associate Director for Commercial\nPrograms suggested that a "service" CCDS wuld be\ncreated which would investigate, optimize, and\nprovide transportation opportunities to all CCDS\'s\nrequiring spaceflight support.\nWhile the Directors saw many benefits in\na\nsuch an approach, it w s believed that the necessary\nskills existed within the present 16 CCDS\'s to\naccomplish this task. Mr. Rose asked the Directors\nto present their alternative approaches at the\nNovember, 1989 meeting at Houston, Texas.\nBased on inputs from the Directors during\nthe ensuing three months, Mr. Rose approved a\nstructure for developing transportation and\ninfrastructure in support of CCDS needs. Dr.\nLundquist was nominated as the Chairman of the\nCommercial Space Services Procurements\nSubcommittee.\nMembers added to the\nSubcommitteeincluded Dr. G. Garrison, Director of\nthe Center for Advanced Space Propulsion, Dr. R.\nAskew, Director of the Space Power Institute, Dr.\nAD. Patton, Center for Space Power, Dr. M.\nLuttges, BioServe Technology, Dr. J. Wallace,\nCenter for Materials for Space Structures, and Dr.\nA. Ignatiev, Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center.\nDuring the next three months Drs.\nGarrison, Speer, Mr. E.G. Allee and the author, all\nof CASP, met with the ELV Subcommittee. These\nprinciples evolved:\n\n1. Short progams are more successful\n&an their long lived counterparts.\n\nCCDS would be funded to accomplish it\'s technicd\nmonitoring and contraa observation role.\n\n2. Procufemenl of systems isn\'t neeessq\nif only services are desired.\n\nAn alternative was presented by Dr. M.\nLuttges of BioServe, University of Glorado,\nBoulder. The BioServe proposal consisted of a\nseries of flights which would take advantage of the\nremaining Discoverer recovery capsules and be\nlaunched from a Pegasus ELV. BioServe\'s selected\ncontractors would procure the hardware and\naccomplish the first mission in 1991.\n\n3. The provider must be ultimately\nresponsible for defining system quality and\nreliability.\n4. Shuttle\'s man rating requirements place\n\nextreme demands on commercial\nexperiments and prototypes.\n\n5. The program must result in a U S\n..\nbased commercial infrastructure which\noffers total services to its customers.\n6. Commercial approaches to procurement\nwill result in lower costs.\n\n7. CCDS\'s would be actively involved in\nthe management of the program but not in\nit\'s technicaI decisions nor as\ncontractor "monitors".\nA survey of potential CCDS and\ncommercial payloads was accomplished by CASP.\nOnce the scope of physical attributes and\nexperiment support needs were characterized, it\nbecame evident that an approach could be\nformulated which would satisfy the diverse needs of\nthe CCDS\'s and their commercial partners. A\nconcept of an ELV launched, commercially\ncontrolled vehicle which would be recovered on land\nwithin the continental United States evolved. If\nsuccessful, a competitive procurement could yield,\nlow cost service could be provided by U S industry.\n..\nWith a strawman approach identified, work areas,\ncosting, and procurement strategieswere developed.\n\nAt the February, 1990 CCDS Directors\nQuarterly Meeting, an overview of a three tier\nsupport approach was presented to CCDS and Code\nC personnel. Consisting of a progression of\ncapabilities ranging from a "micro-busw,a system\ncapable of supporting a 200# package of\nexperiments to a 8000# "factory in spacew, the\nconcept was based on currently designed systems\nwhich could be formed into a commercial venture to\nservice the spaceflight needs of the CCDS\nexperimenters. It was proposed that funding would\nbe made available via augmentation to exisljng\ngrants to fund service contracts. Each participating\n\nDr. Lundquist\'s committee was asked to\nreview al aspects of the two plans and present a\nl\nconsolidated approach to Code C for their\nconsideration. Since the BioServe variant provided\nthe same capability as the micro-bus already\nconsidered by the Subcommittee, the microbus was\neliminated and a plan was prepared which included\nBioServe\'s Commercial Interim Recovery Capsule\n(CIRC), and a mid-range system termed COMET.\nThe high end, factory in space variant was\neliminated since emphasis was placed on solving the\nnear term problem of insuEcient flight\nopportunities for CCDS payloads.\nSince the two remaining systems would be\ncompeting for limited funding in the earlier years,\nit was decided to proceed with planning for a\nsystem which would place at least 6 cubic ft. of\nCCDS payloads into a 250 to 350 IW.equatorial\norbit. Other non-recoverable.experimentswould be\nhoused in the payload adapter and termed the\n"Service Module". All aspects of the procurement\nwould be completed by the CCDS\'s and, if required,\nNASA would have the opportunity to review the\nfind COMET selections during the subcontract\nreview which would be completed by the Grants\nOfficer prior to contract signature.\nTi\nhs\nconsolidated plan was presented to Mr. J. Rose on\nMay 20, 1990. Four days later Mr. Rose notified\nthe COMET Program Manager of his decision to\npursue the COMET plan.\n\nLess than two months later, a draft RFT\nwas released, followed two weeks later by a\ndiscussion with industry. Less than Three months\nfrom it\'s activation, the COMET Team put out an\nRF\'F\' for a l aspects of the program. On October 3,\nl\n1990, fourteen prime contractors placed proposals\nwith CASP for COMETS various work areas.\nProposal evaluation is beiig accomplished by the six\nCCBS\'s vvho make up the COMlET Management\n\nteam. A goaI of July, 19% has hen. set for\n\n&st\n\nfight.\n\nMarket Anaiysis\nIn a 1989 study commissioned by NASA\'s\nOffice of Commercial Programs, SAIC Inc. surveyed\na number of commercial experimenters to\ndetermine the size, type, and requirements of\npayloads they might wish to put into space. F i e s\n1and 2 are extracted from that study and show the\nweight distribution and number of flights for\npayloads which could fly between 1989 and 2000,\nThese two figures portray parameters which have\ngreat impact on system development: weight to orbit\nand total potential markets.\n\nF IIQMS B e t m n 4989 ana ZOO0\n\nI\n\nF\n~\n..-........ ................-...................S.............\n- F I ~ S ~I I ~ ~only -\n\nF i e 1indicates that the largest number\nof commercial payloads will weigh less than 50\nkilograms and that a system capable of orbiting 3CW3\nkg. of experiments will be able to s e ~ c almost\ne\n85% of the identified payloads.\nFigure 2 shows that a large number of\npayloads are not single flight experiments. Rather,\nmany are to be refrned through successive flights as\nthe decade progresses. Note that the data exhibits\na bow wave pattern which seems typical of a\nschedule for projected systems of any type but in\nparticular, spacecraft and boosters. Of equal\nimportance to the total numbers identified is the\nindication that some experiments are ready to fly\nnow while many will become ready for flight when\nties are available. SAIC study data\nfurther noted that one third of all experiments\nrequire recovery. These experiments cannot achieve\nresults without the final product in hand,\nid. crystals from a macromolecular crystal growth\nexperiment, layered substrate from epitaxial growth,\n\nFigure 2\n\nand finished product from materials processing\nwork. Others, not requiring recovery may be on\nELV\'s to satisfy their primary objectives.\nWhile the SAIC statistical sample included\nCCDS payloads, it was difficult to determine the\nstatistical presence of the CCDS\'s in the data.\nAdditionally, it was believed that some CCDS\'s\nmight respond more positively if they were given the\nopportunity to participate in structuring a\ncommercial space program. CASP initiated a\nfollow-up survey shortly before Christmas, 1989.\nhs\nResults of t i survey identified needs for power,\nthermal, micro "g", and other salient experiment\nparameters and provided weight and physical\ndimensions.\nF i e 3 superimposes the results of the\nCASP survey on the weight proEile generated by\nSAIC. Each ( ) represents a CCDS payload whose\n1\ndata was taken from this survey and clearly shows\nthat the CCDS requirements are a subset of the\nlarger data base. Given experiment maturation, all\nportions of the SAIC c w e could reasonably be\nexpected to be reproduced by CCDS sponsored\npayloads.\nFor example, payloads at the right of\nFlgure 3 represent the University of Houston\nEpitaxial Growth and Clarkson Crystal Growth\nexperiments. These are most like experiments\nwhich can evolve into a commercial "factory in\nspace". In one sense, Figure 3 can be segregated\ninto three major categories of payloads based on\ntheir weight and objectives: to the left are those\n\nand q u a l i ~\nneed not be &dated since these are,\nW f l y rquiremenb of the supplier, not of the\nruI ,\npurchaser.\nWe expect to bring forth new\napproaches to support sf space systems.\nDeveloping an inPrastrust;ure dong the lines of\ncurrent aerospace models would force us to repeat\nmany of the less efficient aspects of prior programs:\nthose in which regulation, intricate cost\naccountabity systems and numerous quality\ncheckpoints drown out technical excellence and\nprofessionalism.\n\nFigure 3\n\ninvolving commercial experimentation, to the center\nare those who\'s goals are to refrne the earlier\nexperiments into commercial prototypes, those on\nthe right are directed at commercial production.\nIt appears that the needs of those\ncommercial payloads which reside on the left of the\nweight scale might be met with current, "off the\nshell" technology. Those in the central area can be\nsatisfied by systems already designed but not flown\n(within COMET capability) and those to the far\nright require systems which require Shuttle support\nor ELV systems which are beyond the weight\nc a p a b i l i t y envisioned for COMET.\nCommercialization will ultimately involve all three\nsegments but funding availability will focus our\nattention on the first two.\nWhile systems must be capabIe of\nsupporting commercial spaceflight needs, an\nindustrial capacity in space requires that an\ninfrastructure be developed: one which facilitates\nthe prmss of getting experiments and prototypes\ninto space, gives investigators latitude to optimize\nthe materials and processes of their experiments,\nallows them to influence mission planning, interact\nwith their orbiting experiments, gather data when\nneeded, and finally, have access to their\nexperimental apparatus shortly after its return.\nInfrastructure must be supported by\nsystems which W the needs of the commercially\ni\noriented experiments.\nSuch systems must\naccommodate the spectrum of commercial payloads\nat a low cost and acceptable reliability. Reliability\n\nSince COMET will purchase the services of\nsuppliers rather than their hardware or components,\ninteractions with the supplier will be restrained. In\ncontrast to an aerospace program under government\ncontract, this more commercial approach dictates\nthat providers will insure themselves against failure.\nIn support of this tact, the COMET team\'s\napproach wilI be to review contractor progress to\nthe extent necessary to assure the COMET team of\nthe supplier\'s ability to meet major program\nmilestones. In depth safety, quality, reliability, and\nmaintainability reviews and procedures can give way\nto "best commercial practiceN.\nFinally, if the program is to make an\nimpact on the established way of doing business,\nthere must be opportunities for new, emerging,\n"fledgling"companies to demonstrate their technical\nprowess. .\nIn summary, a coherent approach to\ns e ~ c i n g commercial development requires a\nprogram, not a project. To be of continuing value,\nthe program must be capable of growth: a growth\ndictated by products which are derived from\nexperiments in space and lead to production in\nspace. Our continuing objective must be to develop\nan infrastructure which outlasts current needs, even\ncurrent vision, and allows this country to move\nsteadily and surely toward a fully commercial\napproach to accessing space.\nMission Concept\n\nSupporting the diverse elements of space\ncommercialization brings with it a need to serve a\nwide spectrum of users. Low weight, low power\nexperiments may be all that\'s required to serve a\ncrystal growth investigation while commercial\nprototyping of a materials processing technique may\ngreatly increase the levels of power and tHemal\nsystems need. To adequately support the broad\n\nspectrurn of requirements and build on successes,\nhardware capabili~ must expand to satisfy\ninareasingly larger and more complex payloads.\nHowever, regardless of the size of payload, the\nconcept of a CCDS monitored, contractor operated,\nlaunch and recovery program provides the most\nviable method for creating an infrastructure.\nTo avoid unnecessary program complexity,\nCOMET will make use of expendable launch\nvehicles (ELV\'s) rather than Shuttle. The talents of\nas many as five hardware and one systems\nengineering contractor will be combined to launch,\ncommand, control, re-enter and recover commercial\npayloads. CCDS members will structure statements\nof work and evaluation criteria, select the most\nresponsive proposals, monitor contract performance\nand observe technical compliance.\n\nI\n\nCOMET CONCEPT\n\n1\n\nFigure 4\nAs shown in Figure 4, experiments will be\nmoved directly from investigators to the Payload\nIntegration contractor\'s facility. They will be\nmatched with other compatible experiments, mated\nto a payload structure and integrated into a\ncommon command and data system.\nThe\nexperiments will be checked out and the payload\nintegration contractor will insure that the built-up\npayload assembly meets the necessary interfaces\nwith the FreeFlyer.\n\nA checked out payload assembly will be\ntransported to the Recovery System contractor\nlocation where the Recovery System (R/S)\ncontractor will mate the payload to the R/S. After\nsubsystem operability is confirmed, the Senice\nModule will be mated to the R/S. The Systems\nEngineering contractor will assure proper\nperformance of the integrated R/S, Payload, and\nS e ~ c eModule checkout.\nUpon successful\ncompletion of these tests, the ReeFlyer will be\n\nmoved to the launch site where the Launch Vehicle\ncontractor will mate the FreeFlyer to the launch\nvehicle.\nProvisions will be made wherein\nexperiazenters d have ascess to theis packages up\nto three hours before launch.\nA successful launch will leave the FreeFlyer\nin a . orbit of approximately 300 nm. and at a\nnominal inclination of 4 " Either of these orbital\n0.\nparameters will be modified to match experiment\nneeds, however, land recovery at a suitable\nsoutheast U.S. locations dictates an inclination of at\nleast 38".\nOnce in orbit, the OrbitaI Operations\ncontractor will activate FreeFIyer systems and\ncommand the FreeFlyer as required by the\nexperimenters. Data recorders, real time telemetry,\nand experiment control will be commanded by the\nOrbital Operations team. Automated power,\nthermal, and attitude control systems will be\nprovided by the Recovery System and Service\nModule and will be monitored by the orbital\noperations team along with experiment health and\nstatus.\nUpon successfd completion of mission\nobjectives (a minimum of 30 days), the R/S\ncontractor will calculate the necessary commands\nwhich must be sent to the FreeFlyer to allow the\nR/S and it\'s payloads to re-enter and land at the\ndesignated landing site. This information will be\nprovided to the Orbital Operations team who, after\nassuring that payloads are conf~gured re-entry,\nfor\nwill send the appropriate command sequence. After\na successful re-entry, the R/S will be maneuvered\nihn\nfor a soft landing at a location w t i the U.S..\nRam Air and other controllable parachute systems\nhave been suggested as suitable devices for allowing\nsteering corrections at the terminal portion of the\nflight and for controlling landing loads.\nIf the FreeFlyer has been equipped with\nexperiments in the support module, the orbiting\nsystems will continue to provide data untiI the\nsystems are de-activated, the experiment goals have\nbeen accomplished, or the Service Module re-enters.\nMinimum life of the Service Module is to be 100\ndays.\nCOMETSpayloads will be removed either\nat the recovery site or support area by the R/S\ncontractor. Similarly, the Payload Integration\ncontractor will remove the individual experiments at\n\neiher the recovery or support areas as requested by\nthe inves~gator. Both the Recovery System and\npayload support structure wiU be returned to the\nappropriate location for refurbkhrnent aad r e m to\nthe inventory for Ratuae flights.\nA Systems Engineering contractor will\naddress overall reliability, survivability, and\ncompatibility questions and will assure the technical\nacceptability of experiments and system changes.\nThis organization will also oversee or accomplish\nintegrated testing of COMET components.\n\nSystem Description\nSince COMET\'S design will be determined\nby those selected to provide systems and\ninfrastructure, Figure 5 is only a conceptual\noverview of major hardware components. CDMEI\'s\nFreeFlyer consists of two functional components: A\nRecovery System and a Service Module. In basic\nterms, the Service Module is a satellite, complete\nwith power systems, thermal and attitude control,\nand experiment sensors. While attached to the\nRecovery System, the Service Module provides\npower, telemetry, command and telemetry\nrecorders, and attitude control for its own systems\nand payloads and those located in the Recovery\nSystem.\nWhile many payloads could be\ncharacterkd in terms of their weight, CCDS\nDirectors have found it more appropriate to express\ntheir payload needs in terms of payload volume.\n\nRe-entry System\n6 d o n m o -44d\n\n***-\n\nI P O O ~ h v l c 4\nU\nd\n\nw O*I U U I Q I\n4\nIClllv"w eaa\n\na strong desire to increase to 1 fi? if possible.\n0\nNote that the \'advertised" R/S weight and payload\ncapability are based on an estimate of payload\ne R/S maadachu;ers quote a densiv\nof EX) to 100#/@, we believe a figure of 30 to\n50#/ft\' i appropriate based on experiences of the\ns\nConsortium for Materials Development in Space\n(CMDS) in its Consort and Joust programs.\nCandidate launch vehicles appear to be in\nthe class of Orbital Sciences\' "Taurus", Space\nService\'s uprated "Conestoga" and American\nRocket\'s "AMROC. Each have been designed but\nnot yet flown.\nOther small launch vehicle\nmanufacturers are expected to propose similarly\ncapable systems.\nLikewise, Recovery Systems for the\nCOMET have been designed but not yet flown.\nCheops, a recovery system marketed by COR\nAerospace, an offspring of Lifesat, (currently\nentering phase B design), and an uprated\nDiscoverer, are likely designs for COMETS\nRecovery System. While Lifesat is seen as a\ncandidate, the commercial version must be much\nless sophisticated and considerably less costly.\nAddition of a Service Module on COMET\ngreatly enhances the capability of the FreeFlyer by\nehinating R/S weight and housing systems capable\nof providing virtually an unlimited time in space\nprior to reentry and recovery. This Service Module\ndesign philosophy is similar to that of BIOSAT and\nGemini. In these vehicles, the support, or service\nmodule, housed major systems: communications,\npower and conditioning, thermal control, and\ndata/command storage devices. Like BIOSAT and\nGemini, COMET will be designed to allow late\naccess to the payload area through access\ntechniques which will be proposed in the contract\ncompetition.\nSchedule\n\nService W u l e\n&SIC\n\nL.n*l\n\nradltl.nl\n\nwmw\n\nw bs--4\n\nFigure 5\nBased on the CASP survey and another, more indepth view by the CCDS at Battelle, the m\nviable payload capacity is considered to be 6 ft\' with\n\nContacts with industry indicate that\ncontracts for COMET class system could lead to\nlaunch within 18 months after contract go ahead.\nPotential Recovery System suppliers suggest that\ntheir vehicles could also launch-&thin 18 months of\nAuthorization to Proceed ( A n ) . There is a\ndistinct possibility that systems already in production\nfor micro-sats or other on-going satellite programs\ncould offer a shorter lead h e for orbiting systems.\nHowever, based on discussions with potential\n\nsuppliers, many are burdened vrith a 12to 16 month\ncycle for long lead items.\n\ncontribuGon to the success of C O m T were invited\nto involve their personnel in a contract observation\nand technical monitoring role.\n\ne little testing will be required by our\napproach, adequate schedule time must be allocated\nby the hardware contractors to allow both h e\ncontractor and COMET Management Team to gain\nconfidence in the system\'s capability to be\nsuccessful.\nManagement Plan For COMET\nManagement of the program will\ntake advantage of the depth of experience and talent\nwithin the CCDS team. A matrixed organization\n( F i i e 6) will be headed by a Program Manager,\nassisted by a Systems Engineer, and will include a\nsmall permanent program management staff.

Experiences\non other multi-contractor endeavors indicates that\nwhile lean, the staflirng level is deemed adequate for\nefforts approaching $H)M per year provided that\ngovernment contract monitoring approaches are\nabandoned.\nThrough their intimate knowledge of the\nsubjed area, CCDS\'s who wish to make a significant\n\nAs a member of the Program Management\nOrganization, the CCDS Monitor at the Lead\nCCDS\'s provide a voice within the technical area for\nformulating plans, deftning changes, evaluating\nstatus, and determining the future of the COMET\nProgram.

With the addition of Lead CCDS\'s\nand their CCDS Monitors, the management\nstructurebecomes one in which CCDS members are\ndirectly responsible for the success of the program.\n\nLead CCDS\'s will be funded through an\naugmentation to their respective grants based on a\nbudget provided to OCP by the Program Manager.\nOCP requires that each CCDS provide budgetary\nbackup to their "bogey" similar to that currently\nused in requesting augmentation.\n\nAB Advisoly Council will be fomed by the\nCCDS Directors. Headed by a CCDS Director, the\nCouncil will be comprised of other CCDS Directors,\nand may include members \xc2\xa3rom @ode C, the\nCommercial Program Advisory Council, the\nDepartment of Transportation and the Department\nof Commerce. They will provide overall program\nassessment and guidance, assist in development of\nnew concepts or areas of interest, and accomplish\nhigh level interfaces with Governmental and\ncommercial organizations. Meeting semiannually,\nthe Advisory Council will receive presentations from\nthe Program Manager and Systems Engineer who\nwill present program status and provide an insight\ninto potential opportunities and problem areas.\n\nAn Experiment Selection Committee,\nheaded by a CCDS Director, will consist of CCDS\nDirectors representing Material Sciences, Life\nSciences, Earth Sciences, and one or more from the\n"infrastructure" CCDS\'s (power, propulsion and\nrobotics). They will be joined by members from\nNASA and industry and together will review\nproposed experiments to assure their compatibility\nwith the goals and objectives of the commercial\nspace initiative, assess the ability of the experiment\nto interface with other packages, and assure that the\nexperiment has a reasonable probability of success\nwhen flown aboard the COMET. Based on the\nstate of hardware readiness, they will recommend a\nwindow for flight and provide their\nrecommendations to the program Management\nOffice for technical review and scheduling.\nAs currently formulated, there is no\n\nrequirement for NASA to take an active role in\nmanagement of the COMET program, instead they\nwill review final subcontracts and control the flow of\nsystems funding through a well structured and\nexisting grant augmentation process.\nPlanning and Control\nWe recognize that planning is not a static\nprocess. Ln order to take advantage of unforeseen\nopportunities, a process of reviewing and evaluating\nthe effect of proposed changes will be in place and\nis depicted in F i e 8. Since the need for change\nmay take many paths, an element within the\nProgram Management Office will be the focal point\nfor planning and changes to existing pIans.\nCertainly, the overall cost and schedule effect of\nchanges due to events such as a member CCDS\nidentifying a hardware anomaly, a new concept for\n\nFigure 8\n\noperations, or vendor suggested savings, must be\nascertained before action will be taken. Similarly,\nsuggested changes from the Advisory Council must\nbe viewed in light of their effect on the entire\nprogram before the selected path is changed.\nProposed changes wiII flow to Project\nControl and Analysis where their effect on other\nwork areas will be reviewed for both cost and\nschedule impact. Upon a successful review, the\nBaseline Plan will be modified and the program\n- change instituted.\nAnnual Budget requests to .Code C for\n\nCOMET will be based on the latest revisions to the\nBaseline Plan. Upon funding of the Plan, it will\nthen be designated the Baseline for the f ~ c ayear.\nl\nTechnical Management\nThe Program Office Systems Engineer will\nassume the responsibility for COME\'Ps technical\nleadership. In that role the Systems Engineer will\ninterface with the Payload Selection Committee, will\nprovide technical guidance to member or Lead\nCCDS\'s, and when required, will assure that the\nSystems Engineering contractor is prepared to lead\nintegrated systems tests.\nAssisted by the Lead CCDS\'s and in close\ncontact with the Systems Engineering contractor,\nthe Systems Engineer will monitor technical aspects\nof the program and continuously evaluate the\ncapability of program participants and their\nhardware to meet objectives. In this role the\nSystems Engineer will depend on the ability of the\n\nto the COMET\nFinandal data pert\nprwam which is required by OCP will be\ngenerated by the Program Management Office and\nwill include information pertinent to al participanb\nl\ni the program. Budget or expen&twe information\nn\nwhich concerns data deemed proprietary by either\nthe contractors or Lead CCDS\'s will not be divulged\noutside the Program office. Such information will\nbe requested by the Program Office only when\nneeded to substantiate estimates or biIlings, or\nevaluate specific problem areas.\n\nLead CCDS\'s to evduate progress, identify\nproblems, and hi\nt opportunities within their\nrespective contraclors.\nCommunication\nWhile the Program Management personnel\nare located in the close proximity of each other, the\nLead CCDS\'s are expected to be somewhat\nremoved Our approach recognizes this challenge\nand finds it imperative that modem communication\naides be merged with a management philosophy and\nstructure which stresses frequent, open and frank\ncommunications between the various team\nmembers.\nWe have great respect for the\ncontractors who will be supporting the FreeFlyer.\nIn many instances, they will place the entire future\nof their company on the success of COMET. We\nshare in their future and will strive to maintain a\nfree-flow of communications consistent with good\nbusiness practice.\nMonthly summaries of activity wilI be\ndistniuted by the Program Management Office\nbased on inputs from all members. Hardware\nstatus, launch readiness successes, opportunities,\nand problem areas will all be highlighted.\nInformation gathering will lean toward informal\nmeans. Formal fetters (numbered or otherwise)\nbetween Program members will be kept to a\nminimum consistent with good commercial business\npractice.\nAn annual summary of activity will be\nufl\nprepared by the Program Office to flil\nrequirements of the Grant and Cooperative\nAgreements Handbook. Similar documents from\nLead CCDS\'s will not be required.\nFinancial Information\n\nEach of the work area Contractors will\nsubmit monthly summaries of project expenditures\nand financial forecasts. To this, Lead CCDS\'s will\nadd milestone status, and technical achievements.\nContractor, Lead CCDS\'s, and program\noffice expenditures will be gathered and maintained\nat the Program Management Office. Summaries of\nthis information will be made available to all\nCOMET Management Team members monthly\ndong with a brief analysis of variances.\n\nProcurement PIan\nWhile it was possible to structure the\nprocurement of the COMET launch vehide, etc.\ninto a single package, it was preferred to divide the\noverall project into six major elements. This led to\nincreased probability of competition, and enhances\nthe abiity of the COMET team to select the best\nmix of contractors to accomplish the COMET\nprogram. Dividing the work into more compact\npackages also led to increased participation from\nsmaller, specialized companies whose capital\nstructure may not have allowed them to bid on the\nentire COMET Program.\n\n-\n\nOur approach of breaking the procurement\ninto smaller pieces does not, by it\'s nature, rule out\na single contractor or consortium from proposing on\nthe entire effort. Such a proposal would be\nevaluated using the same criteria as \'required by\neach segment of work.\nTo assure a coherent approach during\nprogram startup, procurement goals were\nestablished:\nOne launch vehicle and a C O m\na.\nFreeFlyer would be procured in FY91 for\nlaunch in mid FY92. After 1992, launches\nwill be conducted annually until both\nbudget and commercial need dictate a\ngreater rate.\nb.\nSystems Engineering will\nbe initiated in FY91 and continue\nfor the life of the program.\n\nc A low level of Orbital Operations and\n.\nPayload Integration will be funded during\n1991 for support to be provided to the\nlaunch in 1992.\n\nProgram Management and a nurnber\nof CCDS\'s will prepare the RPIPs, proposal\nevaluation, and program structuring in\nFUW.\nd.\n\nWhile some may be qualified to bid on the\ncontracts, CCDS\'s and other non-profit\norganizations or companies will not be considered\nas prime contractors for the work elements of the\nCOMET. Similarly, we believe that participation of\nprime contrado= should be limited to those in\nwhich both control and ownership rests within the\nU.S.\nThese guidelines recognize that an objective\nof the COMET program is to develop a lasting,\nU.S. based infrastructure for servicing commercial\nneeds in space. It is the COMET Management\nTeams belief that this goal can be best achieved by\nqualified U.S., for profit f m s .\nTo take advantage of the economies of an\nopen marketplace, all COMET contracts will be\ncompetitively bid using a streamlined variant of the\nprocedure generally followed by governmental\nagencies and large aerospace firms. We have\nfollowed the schedule outlined in Figure 9 in the\npreparation of statements of work and the RFP.\nAU proposers have been advised that their proposal\nmay be accepted without negotiation or further\ndiscussion. .

Six weeks\nwere allocated for responses to the RFP and sixteen\nprime contractors have submitted proposals.\n\nBased on these responses, Lead CCDS\'s\nhave formed Selection Evaluation teams which\ninclude the appropriate legal, contracts, financial\nand technical personnel, Using evaluation criteria\ngenerated during Statement of Work preparation,\neach proposal will be graded on its managerial and\ntechnical approach, cost and other factors.\nTechnical talent, risk, and cost realism will also be\nviewed by the evaluation teams. The CCDS based\nEvaluation Teams will weigh each proposal based\non it\'s strengths, weaknesses, and the ability of the\nproposer to accomplish the COMET mission.\nThese teams will provide their results to the\nil\nSelection Advisory Council who wl consolidate the\nvarious proposals onto approaches which would\naccomplish alI COMET work areas.

In general, ffied\'price\neontracts may be. used where work statements and\nperformance standards are more easily defined, i.e.\nlaunch vehicle and services and the fieeFlyer\ncomponents. Exact levels of support required for\n\nOrbital Operations, Systems Engineering, and\nPayload Integration are more difficult to defme.\nContracts written for these would most probably be\ncost plus fmed fee contracts.\ncontract effort are envisioned:\n\nC O m T will be structured to provide three\nyears of system operation based on a once per year\nlaunch rate. Approximately eighteen months before\nintegration of the third COMET begins, a bid or\noption decision will be made. If options on any of\nthe six efforts are not exercised, the IRFl, cycle will\nbe separated to acquire the needed capabiities.\nOptions offer the COMET the capabiity to\ncontinue proven systems while offering the ultimate\nperformance incentive, continued sales, to the\nCOMET contractors.\n\nThese levek of\n\na. Launch Vehicle\nContract for 3 launches with an option for\n2 additional launches. If exercised, options for the\nfourth launch would be executed prior to the launch\nof the third vehicle. Insurance requirements of\nDOT/OCST must be met by contractor.\n\nCompetition\n\nbRecovery System\n\nAn over-riding goal of competition is to get\nthe optimum infrastructure and services at the most\nrealistic cost. Our initial market survey indicated\nthat there were at least three potential proposers\nfor each of the work areas. More surfaced when\nthe Announcement of Opportunity was released.\nWe have observed that teaming opportunities\nabound and smaller "specialt)r companies have\njoined with larger, better endowed firms.\n\nContract for three flights with two options\nfor an additional flights. With a projected lifetime\nof 10 or more refurbishment cycles, the Recovery\nSystem\nwould be capable of supporting a\ncontinuing experiment load throughout the decade.\nInsurance requirements of DOT must be adhered to\nby contractor.\nc. Service ModuIe\nThree modules wiU be required on the\nbasic program. At a launch rate of one per year,\nthe program will be at a point to exercise options in\nlate 93 or early 1994 or re-bid the effort. An option\nfor two modules would allow for an increased\nlaunch rate as the program matures or continues to\nsustain a once/year rate through 1996.\nd. Systems Engineering\n\nA contract of sufficient length to include\nstart and three launches with two one year options.\nInitial activity will focus on system integration\ninterface specifications and overall mission\nassessment. Re-flight insurance will be purchased\nby the contractor.\ne.\nOrbital Operations and Payload\nIntegration\nA contract sufficient to cover startup and\nthree flights with two one year options. Equipment\npurchases necessary for startup may cause the\ncontracts to be slightly front end loaded however,\nonce operational capability i reached, the dominant\ns\ncost will be manpower.\n\n-\n\nThe probability of achieving adequate\ncompetition was enhanced by issuing one RFP with\nsix work areas. There were no restrictions on the\nnumber of efforts on which a proposer could bid\nhowever, should a proposer be awarded more than\none effort, all elements of the allied statements of\nwork will be included in resulting contract. Cost\nrealism will be a closely monitored issue for\ncontracts awarded which have multiple statements\nof work.\nOnly US or US owned (51% or greater)\ncompanies were eligible to compete as prime\ncontractors. Companies who are members of a\nCCDS were not be ruled ineligible on the basis of\ntheir membership, however that CCDS was not be\nallowed to participate in the evaluation process of\ntheir proposal.\nUniversities and non-profit or not-for-profit\ncompanies or organizationswere also not allowed to\ncompete as prime contractors since investment of\nprofit is seen as a primary mode of developing\ninfrastructure.\n\nSub ConOract Approval\nSince al funding will be in the form of\nl\nGrant augmentaeon, contracts which result from\nti program will be included in W P \' s request for\nhs\naugmentation and the provisions for the Grapt and\nCooperative Agreements Handbook will be\nfollowed. Contracts will be issued by the Center for\nAerospace Research, and, after CAR and contractor\nsignature, will be forwarded to the NASA Grants\nOfficer for review and approval. After approval of\nfunding by the NASA Office Of Commercial\nPrograms, the Program Manager will authorize the\ncontrador(s) to proceed.\nRole of CCDS\'s in the Contracting & Procurement\nProcess\nCCDS\'s have played a key roIe in the\nstructuring the COMET program philosophy,\ndistilling its concepts into practical work areas, and\nevaluating contractor responses in light of our\ngeneralized requirements.\n\n.\n\nThose who desired to take an active part in\nthe program prepared the statements of work for\neach of the six contracts. As a part of the work\nstatement, they have identified hardware and\nsoftware concepts, mission requirements, and\nstandards of quality and safety performance for the\ncontractor. These major definitions provided the\nstructure around which the six SOWSwere built.\nBased on their intimate knowledge of the\ntasks to be performed, the Lead CCDS\'s have\nstructure the evaluation guide for the contract they\nhave prepared, review the RFP in it\'s various stages\nof completion, and bring together a Selection Panel.\nThis panel will review and evaluate the technical,\nmanagement, and cost aspects of all proposals\nreceived for that effort.\nThey will make\nrecommendations to a Selection Advisory Council\nwhich consists of all CCDS\'s involved in the\nevaluation process. The Council will bring the\nvarious proposals into viable program options,\nevaluate risks and opportunities, and make\nrecommendations to the Program Manager who will\nselect the COMET Contractors.\nUpon signatwe of the contract, the Lead\nCCDS will assign a Monitor to accomplish the\ncontract oversight and technical monitoring of the\ncontractors performance. They will evaluate\ncontractor performance, and provide the Program\n\nManagement 8Ee tbeir assessment of schedule\nand milestone achievements. If required, the Lead\nCCDS may be requested to investigate\ninconsistencies in performance or cost structure, and\n. participate i buy off and critical test activity.\nn\nConclusion\nCOMET offers a capable system for\norbiting and retrieving commercially oriented\nprototypes and experiments. By integrating and\nfocusing the efforts of as many as six contractors,\nwe have the opportunity to invigorate the\ncommercial space sector while we build expertise\nwithin the CCDS community.\nOur approach is to free contractors from\nextensive specs and standards, place the burden of\ncost efftciency and quality with the supplier and\nchallenge the contractor team to meet or exceed\nour performance requirements and stringent\nschedule.\nCOMET represents the opportunity for\nCommercialized Space to become a reality. CCDS\'s\nwill provide crucial planning and contracting service\nto assure proper stewardship of the grant funding.\nFor it\'s part, industry will be called upon to provide\nhardware and develop an infrastructure for the\ncontinuing commercialization of space. Structuring\nthe RFP intosix distinct work packages brings with\nit the challenge of integration but the potential of\ninvolving a large number of small firms: firms\nwhose future can be assured by the COMET\nprogram-\n\nIF we were to envision the COMET\nprogram at its most successful end point, hardware\nand infrastructure will have matured to the point\nwhere one of the participants, or a new start, will\nfind it commercially attractive to market and\noperate COMET without the CCDS Management\nTeam. At that time COMET will have reached its\ngoal.\n\n'
