Point sources were extracted using the technique described by Desert, et al. Two known asteroids appear in these frames and 20 sources moving with velocities appropriate for main belt asteroids are present. Most of the asteroids detected have flux densities less than 1 mJy, i.e., between 150 and 350 times fainter than any of the asteroids observed by Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS). These data provide the first direct measurement of the 12 micro-m sky-plane density for asteroids on the ecliptic equator. The median zodiacal foreground, as measured by ISOCAM during this survey, is found to be 22.1 +/- 1.5 mJy per pixel, i.e., 26.2 +/- 1.7 MJy/sr. The results presented here imply that the actual number of kilometer-sized asteroids is significantly greater than previously believed and in reasonable agreement with the Statistical Asteroid Model.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010094058, "id": "58012f2d61854370ada95bc8b3bcbfbf", "publicationDate": "2001-09-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010094058.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010094058/downloads/20010094058.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010094058/downloads/20010094058.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010094058/downloads/20010094058.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
