An approach based on the use of analytic Saaty scale functions has been defined and is being investigated. 2) Planned and facilitated technologies prioritization workshops, supported development of systems program algorithms based on the concept of influence diagramming, and assessment of analogies between aircraft and space systems developments. 3) Video interviews held with X-37 personnel at Dryden. The CD-ROM is being concluded and a near-final review disc is expected soon. 4) CD-ROMS were produced by Engineered Multimedia, Inc. (EMI) under subcontract to SAIC. These two CD-ROM products, \"Microgravity\" and \"New Horizons\", were delivered to MSFS technical representatives at a briefing at SAID on January 18, 2001. 5) Presentation brochure, \"Aviation/Space Analog Team Interim Report\" was provided to Space Propulsion Synergy Team (SPST) members and to NASA personnel. Wrap-up of effort will be a mid-April briefing to both MSFC and the full SPST membership. Support to Phase 2 of CCPD ends 3/31/01. Phase 3 continuation effort planned with emphasis on technical info content. 6) Recommended that eliminating the B-52 flights of the X-37 in favor of alternate approached be evaluated. Discovered that a required change to the thruster valves of the X-37 had not been made. Repair work continues on the lower fuselage section of the X-37, in the areas that experienced core collapse. The currently catalogued potential weight increases and decreases are about equal, but this does not include the impact of the cable weight underestimate reported earlier. The CFD for RCS testing correlates well with the wind tunnel data. 7) The Level IV CCB approved SCN-4 to the MC-1 Engine SPecification. Approved changes have been incorporated into the specification, and Revision D has been released to the Repository. Billy Gonterman, SAIC, traveled to SSC to perform a five-day readiness assessment on the progress of facilities activation. Implemented modifications to the MC-1 Engine TPA Component Database. 8) Replaced 25 Combined-Cycle Propulsion Database (CCPD) documents; modified the low-on screen to include a direct email link for user contact; prepared a summary presentation of current and proposed tasks.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010086424, "id": "3f91b01f8a134c8cbb05cf3e0969b93c", "publicationDate": "2001-02-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010086424.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010086424/downloads/20010086424.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010086424/downloads/20010086424.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010086424/downloads/20010086424.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
