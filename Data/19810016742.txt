The lowest frequency is fed into the horn\nthrough orthogonal pairs of colinear slots, each pair\nbeing fed by coaxial tee power dividers. Other signals\nare fed through a circular waveguide connected to the\nvertex. Band reject cavities block the next higher frequency from passing through the low frequency feed\nslots. The highest frequency signals are fed through\northogonal ports near the far end of the circular waveguide. The intermediate frequency signals are fed\nthrough orthogonal ports spaced along the waveguide.\nFiltering is incorporated for each to maintain isolation\nand low insertion loss, a quarterwave step transformer\nis used between the highest frequency (37 GHz) ports\nand the two next lower frequencies (21 GHz and 18\nGHz) to provide a short circuit for these two lower\nfrequencies, and a TM11 mode generator for the highest\nfrequency is used as a short circuit for the next lower\nfrequency (10.69 Ghz).\n4 Claims, 9 Drawing Figures\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\nSheet 1 of 7\n\n4,258,366\n\nFIG.l\n\n6.633\n\n8 3 GHz\n3\n\nFIG. 2\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\nSheet 2 of 7\n\nFIG.3a\n1\n2\n\n16.3 b\n\n4,258,366\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\nSheet 3 of 7\n\n4,25 8,366\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\nSheet 4 of 7\n\n12\n\n24\n\n4,25 8,366\n\n36\n\n40\n\n60\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n4%\n\n36\n\n24\n\n4,258,366\n\nSheet 5 of 7\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\n1 +-Angle-+\n2\nDegrees\n\nFIG.6\n\n1\n2\n\n24\n\n36\n\n48\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n48\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\n36\n\n24\n\n4,258,366\n\nSheet 6 of 7\n\n1 -Angle2\nDegrees\n\nFIG.7\n\n1\n2\n\n24\n\n36\n\n48\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n48\n\n36\n\n24\n\n4,25 8,366\n\nSheet 7 of 7\n\nMar. 24, 1981\n\n12 - A n g l e 4\nDegrees\n\nFIG.8\n\n1\n2\n\n24\n\n36\n\n48\n\n4,258,366\nTrans on Ant. & Prop., Nov. 1976, pp. 786-792.

The reflector has a 31-inch diameter projected aperture and is fabricated of graphiteepoxy. The CCH is of a broadband, multimode ringloaded design with ports on the side for excitation with 15\none low frequency, and a circular waveguide 14 connected to the vertex (small diameter end) of the horn for\nexcitation with higher frequencies as will be described\n.\nmore fully with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3\nAlthough reference is made to \xe2\x80\x9cexcitation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfeed- 20\ning\xe2\x80\x9d of the antenna system, it should be noted that in\nthis exemplary embodiment, the multifrequency antenna is designed for use a as multichannel microwave\nradiometer. As such the system is intended to receive\nrather than transmit, but as in all passive microwave 25\nsystems, the performance is reciprocal. Therefore reference will be made to \xe2\x80\x9cfeeding\xe2\x80\x9d the antenna system with\na multiplicity of frequencies for convenience only, it\nbeing understood that the antenna system may as well\nreceive the same frequencies simultaneously.\n30\nThe dual-polarized frequencies fed are, for example,\nfive frequencies from 6.6 GHz to 37 GHz. The system\nrequires simultaneousoperation on orthogonal polarizations at 6.633, 10.69, 18, 21 and 37 GHz with low insertion loss and near optimum illumination on all 10 chan- 35\nnels. As just noted above, both polarizations of the\nlowest of the five frequencies are coupled into the CCH\nvia ports on the side of the cone while both polarizations of the highest frequency are fed in at the end of the\nwaveguide which functions as a multiplexer for cou- 40\npling both polarizations of four widely spaced frequencies into the vertex of the cone. The primary patterns\nachieved yield highly efficient secondary patterns of all\n10 signals simultaneously, two (dual polarized) signals\nat each frequency. As will be pointed out with reference 45\nto FIG. 2 good isolation between frequencies and PO,\nlarizations is maintained.\nThe reflector 10 is designed as a section of a paraboloid to subtend an angle of 40\xe2\x80\x9d+42\xe2\x80\x9d=82\xe2\x80\x9d, with edge\nillumination of approximately -18 dB. The scan axis 50\nfor the particular and exemplary application of the antenna system is perpendicular to Earth\xe2\x80\x98s surface and the\nbeam follows a circular arc of k25\xe2\x80\x9d on the Earth\xe2\x80\x98s\nsurface, as the reflector scans about the vertical axis.\nThe CCH (12)and the feed waveguide 14 are stationary 55\nat the focal point (the vertex of the horn 12) with its axis\ncoincident with the horn axis and the scan axis.\nReferring now to FIG. 2,it shows all of the ports in\na single cross section of the assembly necessary for five\ncolinear frequencies of one polarization. A similar struc- 60\nture in an orthogonal plane excites all of the ports necessary for the five co-linear frequencies of a polarization\northogonal to the one polarization. Consequently, it\nshould be clearly understood that FIG. 2 illustrates the\n10-port feed for the horn 12 which operates with dual 65\npolarization at each of five frequencies simultaneously\nin a 6:l band. In that manner, orthogonally polarized\nspherical hybrid modes (HE1I) are excited in the corru-\n\n4\n\ngated conical horn 12 at 6.633, 10.69, 18, 21 and 37\nGHz. This yields primary illumination patterns with\nlow sidelobes and approximately equal E and H plane\nbeamwidths for all frequencies and polarizations.\nThe HE11 spherical hybrid mode for the lowest frequency is excited into the corrugated conical horn\nthrough side ports 160and 1 b provided in the form of a\n6\npair of longitudinal slots 170and 176 near the vertex of\nthe cone. Each slot is backed by a coax-to-waveguide\nadapter, 18a and U b , and each symmetrical pair is fed a\ncolinear signal in phase through a coaxial tee power\ndivider 19 (FIG. 34. This arrangement yields symmetry in each plane, for suppression of undesirable higher\norder modes, and excellent isolation between orthcgonal polarizations. The coax-to-waveguide adapters and\ncoaxial tee power divider for the orthogonal polarization are identified in FIGS. 3a and 3b by the reference\nnumerals l , 19\xe2\x80\x99.\nW and\nThe two coaxial connectors (one\nfor each polarization) are identified by the reference\nnumerals 20 and 20.\nThe desirable features of a corrugated horn are: equal\nE and H plane beamwidths; low sidelobes; coincident E\nand H plane phase center of radiation; near-constant\nbeamwidth and phase center over a broad band. These\nfeatures are obtained if a sufficient length of capacitive\nsurface inside the horn is produced by the corrugations.\nFundamentally, each annular groove is a short circuited\nstub which will produce a capacitive surface effect\nwhen electrically equal to or greater than a quarter\nwave and less than a half wave deep. (This is also true\nbetween 3 of a wave and one wavelength, etc.) The\neffective bandwidth in the fundamental range then appears to be limited to less than an octave, as in a rectangular waveguide. However, use of impedance steps\n(ridges or rings) can increase the bandwidth to greater\nthan 3:1, just as is done in ridged waveguides. By proper\nchoice of groove configuration and spacing, it is possible to obtain capacitive surface impedance inside the\nhorn at all five frequencies needed over the 6:l band. It\nshould be noted that many other groups of frequencies\ncould be utilized over even greater bandwidths, although the entire band may not be usable simultaneously, and some unique combinations may not be\nobtainable. The inoperative (inductive) frequency regions may be reduced or eliminated by tapering the\ncorrugation size along the horn, or interlacing different\nsizes.\nThe remaining four dual-polarized frequencies, 10.69,\n18, 21 and 37 GHz, are fed through the circular waveguide 14 into the apex of the horn 12. The selected\ndiameter and symmetry of the circular waveguide for\npropagation of 10.69 inhibits the propagation of higher\norder modes until about 21 GHz. To avoid undesired\nmodes at 37 GHz, the dual polarized signals introduced\nat that frequency through ports 21 and 21\xe2\x80\x99at the end of\nthe waveguide 14 must be concentrically fed through a\nstep transformer 26.Further a TMI1 mode is generated\nin a region 22 in the waveguide 14 where its diameter\nchanges, and this mode is phased with the TEI1 mode to\nproduce a cosine tapered E field at the end of the circular waveguide (vertex of the conical horn). This means\nthat the end of the waveguide becomes a low sidelobe\nradiating aperture at a point in the large conical horn\nwhich is the phase center of the spherical HE1 1 modes\nof the other frequencies. It can be seen that the size of\nthis aperture determines the beamwidth at this frequency, while the flare angle of the horn is the controlling parameter at all other frequencies. These must be\n\n5\n-\n\n4,258,366\n\n6 -\n\ncompatible, but the waveguide size is also limited by the\nnot be as good due to the ripple on the peak of the\nother frequencies it must propagate.
