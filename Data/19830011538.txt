physical processes taking\n\nplace within the cathode has been developed.\n\nIt can be used to predict,\n\nto first order, lmportant cathode operating parameters such as emission\nlength and insert temperature.\n\nThe analytical formulation of the model is\n\nbased on the concept of an idealized Ilion production region v/hich is defined\nll\n\nas the volume circumscribed by the emitting portion of the insert.\n\nThe\n\nenergy exchange mean free path for primary electrons is used as a criterion\nfor determinlng the length of this region.\n\nAn ion production region aspect\n\nratio (dia.-to-length) of two is suggested as a design criterion for\nminimizing keeper voltage.\n\nThe model accounts for electrons produced in\n\nthe ion production region both by surface emission and by volume ionization.\nSurface and volume energy balances are used to predict plasma density and\nplasma potential in this region.\n\nAn empirical relation is presented which\n\ncan be used to estimate cathode internal pressure (a necessary input to the\nmodel) using the mass flow rate, discharge current and cathode orifice\ndiameter.\n\nCalculations based on the model are compared with experimental\n\nresults.\nThis research is described in some detail in Reference 1. which was\n~\n\n~\n\nreleased recently, and it will therefore not be reproduced here.\n\nIn\n\naddition a summary of this work is described in a recently completed paper 2\nwhich is included in Appendix A of this report.\n\nION BEAMLET VECTORING\nJ. M. Homa\nAn experimental study of ion beamlets emerging from two-grid optical\nsystems that were vectored by translating the screen/accelerator grid holes\nrelative to each other was completed. A paper 3 describing this work is\nincluded in Appendlx A of this report.\n\nA more detailed description of\n\nthis research will also be presented in thesis form and present plans call\nfor this work to be released as a NASA Contractor report.\n\nThe results of\n\nthis research can be used to design accelerating systems in which the\ndirection and focus of emerging beamlets are important.\n\nDeflection and\n\ndivergence angle data were collected for two-grid systems as a function\nof the relative displacement of these grids.\n\nAt large displacements,\n\naccelerator grid impingement was observed to become a limiting factor and\nthis defined the useful range of beamlet deflection.\n\nBeamlet deflection\n\nwas found to vary linearly with grid offset angle over this range.\n\nValues\n\nof deflection-to-offset angle ratio and the useful range of\n\ndeflec-\n\ntion were determined as functions of grid hole\nand accelerating voltage levels.\n\ngeometries~\n\nbea~let\n\nperveance\n\nlevels~\n\nThe divergence of the beamlets was found\n\nto be unaffected by deflection over the useful range of beamlet deflection.\n\nCONTROLLING ION CURRENTS TO DISCHARGE CHAMBER SURFACES\nJ. R. Brophy\nThe study of mechanisms that enable a designer to control the loss\nrates of ions to various discharge chamber surfaces in an ion thruster\ncontinued to focus on the use of the flexible magnetic field ion source\n\n-~\n\nduring the past year.\n\nThe resulting research has been described in a paper 4\n\nincluded in Appendix A of this report.\nThe flexible magnetic field thruster is a unique research tool for\nstudying the behavior of direct current electron-bombardment ion thrusters.\nIt utilizes a long wire anode shielded by a circumferential magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field around the anode, which is produced by passing a direct\ncurrent of up to 150 amperes through the wire, restricts primary electron\nflow from the discharge plasma to the anode.\n\nDifferent magnetic field con-\n\nfigurations can be created by routing the anode wire in various ways through\nthe discharge chamber.\n\nDivergent, cusped and mu1tipo1e magnetic field con-\n\nfigurations have for example been created in this manner.\n\nThe thruster is\n\nalso designed so ion currents to various internal surfaces can be measured\ndirectly and these measurements facilitate calculation of the distribution\nof ion currents within the discharge chamber.\n\nExperiments indicate that the\n\ndistribution of ion currents inside the discharge chamber is strongly dependent\non the shape and strength of the magnetic field but independent of the discharge current, discharge voltage, and neutral flow rate.\n\nThrough proper\n\nselection of the magnetic field shape and strength, the fraction of the ions\nproduced in the discharge chamber that is directed toward the screen grid has\nbeen increased to over 50%.\n\nMeasurements of the energy cost per plasma ion\n\nindicate that this cost decreases with increasing magnetic field strength\ndue to increased anode shielding from the primary electrons.\nper argon plasma ion as low as 50 eV were measured.\n\nEnergy costs\n\nThe energy cost per beam\n\nion was found to be a function of the energy cost per plasma ion, extracted\nion fraction and discharge voltage.\n\nPart of the energy cost per beam ion\n\ngoes into creating many ions in the plasma and then extracting only a fraction\nof them into the beam.\n\nThe rest of the energy goes into accelerating the\n\n-4-\n\nremaining plasma ions into the walls of the discharge chamber.\n\nMeasurement\n\nof ion fluxes across a virtual anode surface appear to indicate that ions\ncross this surface with velocities approaching their random thermal velocity\nrather than the Bohm velocity.\n\nION EXTRACTION USING CLOSELY SPACED GRIDS\nDean Rovang\nExperimental work has shown that the ion current density that can be\nextracted through two grid systems can be enhanced if small diameter apertures in closely spaced grids are used.\ncontained in Appendix A.\n\nThis work is described in a paperS\n\nIt has focused on accelerator systems with small\n\nscreen hole diameters\n\n(~2.0\n\n100, 300, and 500 V.\n\nThe apparatus developed for this study is shown to be\n\nmm) operating at net-accelerating voltages of\n\nwell suited for measuring the impingement-limited perveance, electron backstreaming, and electrical breakdown characteristics of two-grid ion accelerator systems.\n\nResults suggest that the impingement-limited perveance is\n\nnot dramatically affected by reductions in screen hole diameter to 1.0 mm.\nImpingement-limited performance was found to be dependent on the grid\nseparation distance, the discharge-to-tota1 accelerating voltage ratio, and\nthe net-to-tota1 accelerating voltage ratio.\n\nResults obtained using closely\n\nspaced grids having small hole diameters and operating at fixed low values\nof net accelerating voltage show that the onset of high lmpingement current\noccurs at progressively higher current density levels as the net-to-total\naccelerating voltage ratio is increased.\n\nThis unexpected result suggests a\n\nnew philosophy of high current density grid operation at high net-to-total\naccelerating voltage ratios.\n\nWhen grids are operating at this condition\n\n-5it appears the onset of electron backstreaming ultimately determines the\nextractable ion current density.\n\nBeam current densities as high as 25 mA/cm 2\n\nwere obtained using grids with 1.0 mm diameter holes operating at a net\naccelerating voltage of 500 V.\n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF STRAY MAGNETIC FIELDS ON THE ION BEAM NEUTRALIZATION\nFeng Yu-Cai\nWork has continued on the study of the influence of magnetic fields\nin the vicinity of the neutralizer on its capacity to couple to and\nneutralize an ion beam emerging from a thruster. This work is described\nin a paper 6 also included in Appendix A. This paper describes the experimental investigation in which a comparison of the ion beam neutralization\ncharacteristics of a local neutralizer (within\nwith those associated with a distant one\nwas made.\n\n(~\n\n~\n\n5 cm of the beam edge)\n\n1 meter away from thruster)\n\nThe influence of magnetic fields in the vicinity of the neutral-\n\nizer cathode orifice which were either parallel with or normal to the\nneutralizer axis were studied.\n\nPlasma property profiles which reflected\n\nthe influence of the magnetic fields were measured.\n\nThe results indicated\n\nthat magnetic fields at the region of a neutralizer cathode orifice influence its ability to couple to the ion beam.\n\nThey show that there is a\n\npotential jump from the neutralizer cathode orifice to the plasma which\nexists close to the orifice.\n\nThe magnitude of this potential jump increases\n\nas the axial component of magnetic flux density increases.\n\nA magnetic field\n\nperpendicular to the neutralizer axis induces a potential rise a few centimeters further downstream of the neutralizer cathode.\n\nTest results indicate\n\nthe path length from the neutralizer to the beam along magnetic field lines\n\n-6-\n\nalso has an effect on the beam-to-neutralizer plasma potential difference\nbut this effect was typically smaller than the other two effects.\n\nThe\n\nresults suggest that in order to minimize the adverse effects of stray\nmagnetic flelds, a region as free of magnetic fields as possible should be\nselected for placement of the neutralizer.\n\nENHANCEMENT OF ION BEAM CURRENTS\nTHROUGH SPACE CHARGE COMPENSATION\nFeng Yu-Cai\n\nIntroduction\nLangmuir 7 has discussed the possibility of increasing the space charge\nlimited electron current between two electrodes by injecting positive ions\ninto the electron space charge and thereby partially neutralizating its\ndetrimental effect on el ectron extraction.\n\nIn the foll owing vlOrk the\n\nneutralization of the positlve ion space charge induced by injecting negative\nchanges into the region between the grids of a positively charged ion accelerator has been studied theoretically.\n\nIf it is possible to do this the\n\nion current density of the extracted beam could be increased.\n\nThis could\n\nlead to an increased thrust density for electrostatic thrusters.\nSeveral options for charged particle injection are considered and the\nresults suggest that the extracted ion beam density can be increased greatly\nby negatively charged particle injection.\n\nThe ratio of the extracted beam\n\ncurrent density to the conventional space charge limited value can be increased through the use of charged particle injection by a factor 30 or\nmore, depending on the current density and velocity distribution of the\ninjected negatively charged particle beams.\n\nThe ratio of injected particle\n\ncurrent density to the ion beam current density required to effect this\nchange is of the order of the square root of the ratio of the extracted ion\nmass to the injected particle mass.\n\n.\n\nIn the following development the injected\n\nnegatively charge particles will be designated as electrons and the extracted\nbeam will be designated positive ions.\nter~s\n\nThe analysis is carried out in general\n\nhowever and the injected particles could just as well be negative ions.\n\n-8-\n\nFurther, the results are applicable to the case where positive ion injection\nis used to enhance the extracted current densities of negative ion beams.\nElectron Injection Between the Acceleration Grids\nConsider an infinite plane screen grid IIAII at potential VA and a\nparallel plane cathode (accelerator grid lIe ll at zero potential located at\na distance\n\na from IIAII as shown in Fig. 1). Assume an infinite supply of\n\nions without appreciable initial velocities is available at the screen grid.\nIf these ions are extracted at the space charge limit, the potential\ngradient at the screen grid will be zero, and the current density is giveh\nby the Child-Langmuir equation 8\nJ" "\n\n48\n\n= --2.\n9\n\n\'0\n\nwhere e ,s the ion charge,\n\n8\n\n0\n\n(2e)\nm"\n,\n\nis the\n\n1/2\n\nV 3/2\n\n...!l_\n\n(1)\n\na2\n\nperm~ttivity\n\nof free space and m is\ni\n\nthe mass of the ions.\nLet us now consider the effect of introducing negative electrons without initial velocity, uniformly distributed over a plane IIBII which is at a\ndistance b from IIAII as suggested in Fig. 2.\n\nBetween IIBII and "All there is\n\nas a result of this injection an electron current per unit area je.\n\nBecause\n\nof the partial neutralization of the ion space charge, the ion current per\nunit area from the screen grid will increase to a new value, ji.\n\nWe\n\nassume that the ions and electrons do not collide with gas molecules nor with\neach other and that no appreciable number of ions or electrons is lost by\nre-combination during the passage between the electrodes.\n\nLet vi(x) be the\n\nvelocity of the ions at any point p, which is a distance x from the screen\ngrid IIAII.\n\nThe ion current density at p is then Pi(x).\n\nThe corresponding\n\nquantities for the electrons are denoted by the subscript e.\nThen in region A-B one has\n\n-9-\n\nPLANE\n\nPLANE IIAII\n\nlie\n\nII\n\n(POTENTIAL VC=O)\n\n(POTENTIAL VA ) I\n\n..\n\no\n\na\n\n)(.\n\nFig. 1 Configuration without Electron Injection\n\nARBITRARY PLANE\n\n(P07IALV)\n\nPLANE IIAII\n( POTENTIAL VA )\n\nPLANE II B II\n(POTENTIAL VB )\n\nPLANE lIe ll\n( POTENTIAL VC = 0 )\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\njj I\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\njj\n\nI\nI\nI\nI .\n\n.\n\nI Je\nI\nI\n\n0\n\n.\n\nb\n\na\n\nx\n\nFig. 2 Configuration with Intra-grid Electron Injection\n\n-10(2)\n\nwhere\n(3)\n\nThe electron charge density in this same region is given by\n(4)\n\nwhere\n(5)\n\nV is the potential at a point p and\n\nVB is the potential at plane "B".\n\nPoisson\'s equation may be written in one dimension as\nJ.\n\n1\n\n(6)\n\nUsing the definitions,\n_ jel(rii;\n\n(7)\n\na=r;V~\'\nand combining Eqs.

(7). The figure suggests the highest ion current\nenhancement is realized at when emission occurs at\nviously.\n\n~B=0.4\n\nas suggested pre-\n\nIt also shows that a reduction in the injected electron current\n\nfrom the maximum value (a=l) is accompanied by a dramatic decrease in the\nextracted ion current.\n\nThis points out the drawback of electron injection\n\nbecause a=l implies a large electron current (Eq. 20) and this in turn\nsuggests a sUbstantial input power to the electrons.\nElectron Injection from Upstream of the Screen Grid\nLet us now consider the effect of introducing negative electrons which\nare shot into the region between screen and accelerator grid from the upstream\nside of the screen grid with their velocity directed toward the accelerator grid.\nBecause of the retarding field seen by the electrons as they enter the region\nbetween the grids, their velocity will decrease and at some distance from\n"A" (at plane "B" shown in Fig. 5) their velocity will become zero.\nwill then be accelerated back toward the screen grid.\n\nThey\n\nAs before, we assume\n\nthat the ions and electrons collide with neither the gas molecules nor with\neach other and that no appreciable number of ions or electrons is lost by\nrecombination during the passage between the electrodes.\n\nAs a consequence\n\nof electron injection to neutralize the ion space charge, the ion beam\ncurrent density extracted by the grids will reach a value ji.\nThe development of this problem parallels exactly the problem just\nsolved.\n\nThe only difference in the development being that the density\n\nthe injected electrons at any given location is twice that for the case\nwhere electrons are emitted from a plane between the grids.\nSolution of this problem shows that there is an optimum injection\n\n-17ARBITRARY PLANE\n(POTENTIAL V)\n\nPLANE IIAII\n( POTENTIAL VA )\n\n)\n..\n\nPLANE lIe ll\n(POTENnAL Vc= 0 )\n\n..\n\njI\n\nje\n\nPLANE II BII\n(POTENTIAL

electron injection can be effected by optimal\nelectron injection from upstream of the grids.\n\nNumerical integration of\n\nthe equations in this case can again be used to determine potential,\npotential gradient and ion velocity profiles.\nto those shown 1n Fig. 3.\n\nThese profiles are identical\n\nThe plot of extracted ion current as a function\n\nof injected electron current is the same as Fig. 4, except for the fact\nthat the peak ion currents occur at a normalized injected electron current\n(a) of one half.\n\nHence one can conclude that the effect of electron injection\n\nis the same regardless of the means of getting the electrons into the ion\nacceleration region.\n\nThe advantage of upstream electron injection is the\n\nrequired electron current is half of that required for intra-grid injection\n(a\n\n= 1/2\n\nvs. a\n\n= 1).\n\nElectron Injection from both Sides of the Screen Grid\nIt is possible to inject electrons from both upstream and downstream\nof the screen grid simultaneously in order to neutralize the space charge\nwithin an 10n beam.\n\nFigure 6 shows a physical model of this situation in\n\nwhich electrons are inJected from upstream of the screen grid at plane "A"\nwith a current density jel and a velocity sufficient to enable them to reach\nplane "F".\n\nThese electrons pass both directions through the region A-F as\n\nshown in Fig. 6.\n\nElectrons are also released at plane "B" with zero velocity\n\n-19-\n\nand they pass through region A-B going toward plane "A" as shown.\n\nAs in\n\nthe cases considered previously collisions are neglected and one computes\nthe electron and ion charge density in each region as a function of the\nvelocity of the electrons injected from upstream, the location of electron\ninjection from between the grids and the current densities of the two injected electron beams.\n\nThe charge densities are then used in the Poisson\n\nEquation describing each region, the resulting equations are integrated\nand potentials and potential gradients are matched at planes "B" and "F".\nThe basic procedure is similar to the ones followed for the cases just\ndiscussed.\n\nAs a result of this analysis one obtains the following ex pres-\n\nsions for the nondimensional ized locations of the planes "S" and lip and\nthe ratio of the ion current to the ion current without electron injection.\n\n(25)\n1\n\n- [ 2a 1 (1-IJ>F)!2 +\n\na2(l-IJ>B)~ JI~\n\nf\nJ!\n\nI\n\n-~\n\nIJ>\n\n+\n\ndlJ>\n\nFj (l2(1J>-lJ>s) !,;\n2\n\n+ (l-IJ\xc2\xbb\n\n!,; _ [\n2\n\n2a (l-IJ>F) !,; + a 2

The results shown in Fig. 11 suggest the answer to this question.\nIn this figure the normalized extracted ion current is plotted against the normalized\nfirst stage of injected electron current for a typical electron injection\ncase (three stages of injection with the second and third stages at optimal\ncurrent densities).

Recent experiments lO suggest\nthat these concepts are of interest however in ground based applications\nwhere power demand is a lesser concern.\n\nTHE ELECTROTHERMAL RANJECT\nBen D. Shaw\nIn order to extend the practical uses of space for mankind it is desirable (1) to reduce the cost for delivery of a payload into space from\nearth, (2) to simplify the systems needed to make these launches and (3)\nto improve thelr reliabilityo\n\nOne system that holds some promise of\n\nachieving these objectives involves the acceleration of a payload to a\nsufficiently high velocity at the earth\'s surface so it would be able to\nundergo passage through the earth\'s atmosphere and still have adequate\nvelocity to enable it to meet its mission objectives in space.\n\nOne candi-\n\ndate propulsion system that has been analyzed and appears to hold promise\nfor use in such a launching scheme is the electrothermal ramjeto ll It\nappears to be capable of operation at the high thrust levels needed to\nachieve the high launch velocities desired with a reasonably short launch\ntubeo\nThe concept of this launch scheme is illustrated in Fig. 12.\n\nTo effect\n\nthe launch, propellant, preferrably a low molecular weight gas, would be distributed in the launch tube upstream of the projectile shown.\n\nThis projec-\n\ntile, which is also the payload, would be brought to an initial velocity\nwhere efflcient ramjet operation coul d begin by driving it with ali ght gas\ngun d rl. vero 11 At this point the projectile shown proceeding down the launch\ntube in Fig. 12 would begin to process the propellant in the launch tube\nthrough its annular intake diffuser.\n\nThe diffused propellant would then\n\npass through a heat addition zone in the ramjet where energy would be added to\nraise its stagnation temperature.\n\nHeat addition woul d be effected using either\n\nelectromagnetic energy radiated from pulsed lasers or directly deposited\nenergy from pulsed electrical discharges located along the tube wallo\n\n-37DIRECTION OF\nPROJECTILE\nMOTION\n\n1\n\nLAUNCH TUBE\n( STATIONARY)\nOBLIQUE SHOCK\nPROJECTILE CONE\nHALF - ANGLE (8

tube.\n\nThe heated propellant would then pass through the nozzle\n\nand would be expelled at a sufficiently high pressure and velocity to\nproduce the desired thrust.\n\nThe thrust level desired would actually be\n\nattained by adjusting the initial temperature and pressure of the propellant\nin the tube, the rate of heat addition to the propellant, and the ramjet\ngeometry.\nA preliminary analysis of this concept was conduced during the grant\nperiod and the results of this work were presented in the paper 11 inc1ued in\nAppendix A.\n\nIn thlS work ltwas assumed that the diffusion process illustrated\n\nin Flg. 12 could be modelled as an isentropic one.\n\nIt was recognized that\n\nthis diffuser model was idealized and that the flow through the actual diffuser would encounter a system of shocks.\n\nThe preliminary analysis based on\n\nthe isentropic assumption suggested that the concept was workable and that\nreasonable energy utilization efficiences could be expected with it.\n\nTheoretical Model of Diffuser Shock Losses\nIt was recognized that the diffusion process within an electrothermal\nplug ramjet (Fig. 12) would be non-isentropic because of shock losses.\n\nFor\n\nthis reason the first extension of the preliminary thermodynamic analysis\nof the electrothermal ramjet has been the incorporation of these losses.\nFor supersonic operation a conical shock will either be attached to the nose\nof the projectile or a bow shock will be driven ahead of it.\n\nWhich will\n\noccur depends on the velocity of the projectile and the geometric and boundary\ncondltions associated with the flow.\n\nOf the two options the attached conical\n\nshock is preferrab1e because the stagnation pressure loss across a conical\n"\n\nshock system is less than that across a bow shock seeing the same free stream\nflow.\n\nConsequently, flow conditions that enhance attachment of a conical\n\n-39-\n\nshock are desirable and a conical shock model has therefore been used in\nthe analysis.\nIn order to incorporate shock losses into the complete analysis of the\ndevice, the flow conditions immediately downstream of the conical shock\nshown in Fig. 12 were first modelled.\n\nIn an actual diffuser of the type\n\nshown, the attached conical shock would be followed by complex series of\nreflected shocks terminated by a normal shock.\n\nThe location of this termi-\n\nnating normal shock would depend on the geometry of the device and the flow\nboundary conditions.\n\nIdeally the stagnation pressure loss associated with\n\nthe initial conical shock and the series of reflected shocks will be less\nthan that of a single conical shock terminated by a normal shock.\n\nHowever,\n\na review of the literature on hypersonic wind tunnel diffusers (Ref. 12 for\nexample) has shown that the actual stagnation pressure recovery that can be\nexpected is very close to the stagnation pressure recovery prediced theorectically by assuming that all of the flow goes through the single conical\nshock followed by a normal shock.\n\nBecause of this, the conical/normal shock\n\nmodel suggested in Fig. 12 was used in the analysis.\nThe thermodynamic properties of the working fluid will vary over the\nrange of temperatures and pressures encountered during ramject operation\nprimarily because of the effects of dissociation.\n\nFor this analysis, however,\n\nit was desirable to avold the complications of temperature and pressure dependent specific heats and gas constants.\n\nIn addition, increases in propel-\n\nlant temperature predicted during ramjet operation are generally accompanied\nby corresponding increases in pressure.\n\nThis being the case, it is not too\n\nunrealistic to use flxed values for the specific heats and the gas constant.\nThe results contained in this analysis were obtained assuming ideal gas\nbehavior and diatomic hydrogen was the working fluid.\n\nA gas constant (R)\n\n-40of 4160 jou1es/kgoK and a ratio of specific heats (y) of 1.4 were used.\n\nIt\n\nis also noteworthy that the exhaust pressure for the device turns out to be\nquite high for the cases examined to date.\n\nThis suggests that recombination\n\nrates in the exhaust will be high, that frozen flow losses will be small and\nthis should also tend to make efficiencies computed using the ideal gas\nassumption reasonably accurate.\nThe model suggested in Fig. 12 implies an axi-symmetric (two-dimensional)\nconical flow field immediately downstream of the conical shock that must\nsomehow be matched to the one-dimensional model used to describe the flow\ndownstream of the normal shock.\n\nThe marrying of these flow fields necessitated\n\nthe development of an averaging procedure that provided single values of flow\nproperties at the conical flow field exit for input into the one-dimensional\nnormal shock relations.\n\nThis was accomplished by determining a mass weighted\n\naverage of each property using the mass, energy, and momentum conservation\nequations.\n\nDownstream of the postulated normal shock in the diffuser, all\n\nflow throughout the ramject was assumed to be well mixed and one-dimensional\nin nature.\n\nThe flow exiting the diffuser passes through a constant area,\n\nfrictionless passage where heat addition at a subsonic Mach number is assumed\nto occur.\n\nNext the flow passes through the nozzle where isentropic expansion\n\nto the maximum attainable supersonic Mach number is achieved under the constraint of the available exhaust area.\nIt is also assumed that the ramjet exhaust pressure can be maintained\nat that value dictated by the isentropic expansion through the nozzle.\n\nThis\n\nstatic exhaust pressure required at the projectile base will vary with projectile position and control of its magnitude would have to be achieved in an\nactual device by proper design of the launch tube.\n\nSuch a tube would consist\n\nof two sections, a cavity section into which propellant processed by the\n\n-41ramjet would be collected and the launch section through which the projectile would pass.\n\nIt has been assumed in this analysis that the cavity\n\nsection would be designed to have the length and cross-sectional area needed\nto accommodate the propellant and to facilitate maintenance of the necessary\nprojectile base pressure.\n\nWhile it seems possible to do this intuitively,\n\nthe unsteady fluid mechanical analysis of this process has not yet been\nattemped.\nThe basic equations of fluid mechanics (conservation of mass and energy\ncoupled with a thermodynamic path equation) were applied to all processes\noccurring within the ramjet.\n\nSolutions were obtained numerically.\n\nPropellant\n\nvelocities were computed in the frame of reference of the moving projectile.\nThe fact that the tube wall, which is the outer boundary to the flow, is\nmoving in this frame of reference was assumed to have no effect on the flow\nbehavior.\n\nThis analysis assumes that the projectile has been accelerated to\n\na high enough velocity before the initiation of ramject operation so that\nattachment of the conical shock to the diffuser nose is assured.\n\nThrust was\n\ncomputed by applying the momentum equation in the frame of reference of the\ncontrol volume moving with the projectile.\nIt should be noted that the boundary conditions associated with the\nannular flow ramjet are different than those associated with conventional\nramjet operation.\n\nIn the annular flow ramjet the inlet and outlet flow areas\n\nmust be equal and the flow area in the heat addition zone must be less than\nthis area.\n\nFurther the ramjet inlet and outlet pressures will be different.\n\nFor the conventional ramjet on the other hand the inlet, outlet and heat\naddition region flow areas are not constrained, but the\npressures must be equal.\n\ninlet and outlet\n\n-42Results for a Typical Supersonic Launch Cycle\nIn the analysis procedure that has been described it is assumed that\nthe projectile will be acted upon by either the ramjet thrust or some externally applied force needed to produce the desired acceleration.\nresult of this assumption the projectile trajectory is known.\n\nAs a\n\nThis in turn\n\nimplies the projectile velocity is known and hence the propellant flow velocity\nlnto the ramjet diffuser is also known at each position along the launch\ntrack.\n\nIn order to minimize the mechanical complexity of the projectile\n\nit has also been assumed that the projectile geometry remains fixed throughout the launch cycle.\n\nThe diameter of the launch tube is allowed to vary\n\nas a function of axial position however so efficient ramjet operation can\nbe achieved.\n\nFurther, the present analysis requires that the flow through\n\nthe ramjet is choked at the nozzle throato\n\nWhile choking could occur at\n\nthe diffuser throat rather than the nozzle throat, these two throat areas\nwere selected so that choking would occur in the nozzle because this gave\nthe best performance o Using the analysis one determines how the tube diameter and heat addition rate should vary so that a prescribed thrust can be\nmaintained throughout the period of ramjet operation.\nA typical case of electrothermal ramjet operation has been examined.\nIn this case hydrogen propellant is placed in the launch tube at a pressure\nof 30 atmospheres and a temperature of 300 o K.\n\nA 10 kg projectile having a\n\n16 cm diffuser throat diameter (Figo 12), an 8 cm center body diameter and\na 16 em nozzle throat diameter is used.\n\nThese values were selected because\n\nthey gave reasonable performance and were at the same time sufficient to\nensure structural integrity during launcho\n\nIt is also required that the\n\nthrust be sufficient to sustain the projectile at a constant acceleration\nlevel of 30,000 g until it reaches a final velocity of 15,000 m/sec.\n\n-43The results of the analysis in which diffuser shock losses are included are compared to results obtained using an isentropic diffuser model\nin Fig. 13 for this particular case.\n\nFigure 13a shows how the projectile\n\nand exhaust velocities vary during the launch cycle.\n\nThe projectile velocity\n\n(relative to the stationary launch tube) is observed to increase linearly\nwith time as a consequence of the constant thrust and constant projectile\nmass that have been specified.\n\nThe exhaust velocities (relative to the\n\nproJectile) computed for the isentropic and non-isentropic cases are shown\nin Fig. l3a for times greater than 10 to 16 msec.\n\nPrior to these times,\n\nthe conical shock would not attach, adequate thrust could not be produced\nregardless of the level of heat addition to the propellant, or the tube\ndiameter became so large that the assumption of a one-dimensional flow model\nwas seriously violated.\n\nDuring these initial phases a gun mode of operation\n\nwould be required to accelerate the projectile to the velocities at which\nproper ramjet operation could be initiated.\n\nThe parameter appearing in\n\nthis figure (o) is the half angle of the diffuser cone.\nabout 22.5\xc2\xb0\n\n1S\n\nA half angle

As ramjet operation continues, the momentum change of the propellant\nbegins to dominate the thrust, although not completely.\n\nFor example, at the\n\nend of the operating period for the 22.5\xc2\xb0 cone angle device,\n\n~\n\n35% of the\n\nthrust is being provided by the pressure differential across the projectile,\nand: 65% of the thrust is being provided by the momentum change of the\npropellant.\nFigure l3d shows the temporal variation in propellant exhaust temperature\nthat is induced by the heat addition profile shown in Fig. l3e.\n\nThe tem-\n\nperatures and thermal input powers shown are high, but not excessive in\nlight of the short launch times involved.\n\nThe power going into the pro-\n\njectile is also shown in Fig. l3e and the ratio of this power to the thermal\n\n-47-\n\ninput power at a given time is termed the instantaneous efficiency.\n\nThis\n\nratio is plotted as a function of time for the cases considered in\n...\n\nFig. l3f.\nThis figure shows that for the case under consideration the nonisentropic diffuser having a cone half angle of 22.5\xc2\xb0 again produces results\nclosest to the isentropic ones.\n\nThis suggests then that there is an optimum\n\ndiffuser shape and that the optimum conical diffuser has a cone half angle\nof\n\n~\n\n22.5\xc2\xb0.\n\nThe isentropic efficiency is observed in Fig. l3f to be\n\nsubstantially greater than that for the best non-isentropic case (0\nover most of duration of the launch.\n\n= 22.5\xc2\xb0)\n\nThe efficiency of the electrothermal\n\nramjet equipped with this optimized real istic diffuser is however still very\nattractive.\n\nIt exhibits an efficiency near the end of the launch of about\n\n50% and the mean efficiency over the complete cycle beginning at 10 msec is\nobserved to be greater than 40%.\n\nThis efficiency is much greater than the\n\nefficiencies of chemical and light gas gun launchers and is competitive with\nefficiencies predicted for rail guns and mass drivers.\nThe reason why an optimum diffuser cone half angle is observed in the\ndata of Fig. 13f can be understood by considering the fluid flow conditions\nassociated with the limiting cone half angles (i.e. values of 0\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0).\nFor the present model we are requiring subsonic heat addition so the flow in\nthe diffuser section must pass through a normal shock wave at some location.\nFor a specified incoming (free-stream) Mach number, each of these cones\ncoupled with the diffuser, will produce identical stagnation pressure recovery effects.\n"\n\nThe very shallow angle\n\n(~\n\n0\xc2\xb0) cone will produce a Mach wave\n\nat the diffuser entrance across which the Mach number of the flow remains\nconstant.\n\nThe flow will then enter the supersonic diffuser, where it must\n\nencounter a normal shock in order to reach the subsonic flows required in\n\n-48the heat addition region.\n\nThis means the stagnation pressure loss across\n\nthe shock will correspond to the free-stream Mach number.\nwill propagate a bow\n\nshoc~which\n\nThe blunt cone\n\nis essentially a normal shock, ahead of it.\n\nThe bow shock will cause the flow entering the diffuser to become subsonic,\nand the stagnation pressure loss will again correspond to the free stream\nMach number.\n\nThis analysis has shown that a moderate cone half-angle\n\n(between 0\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0) and the corresponding conical shock coupled with a\nnormal shock will produce more efficient stagnation pressure recovery than\nwill either of these single normal shocks.\n\nConclusions\nThere is an optimum cone angle for the diffuser in an electrothermal\nramjet which yields maximum energy efficiency.\nsidered here it is\n\n~\n\n22.5\xc2\xb0.\n\nFor a typical case con-\n\nThe efficiency of the electrothermal ramjet\n\nis degraded from the isentropic efficiency when account is taken for shock\nlosses occurring in the diffuser.\n\nOverall energy efficiencies for a typical\n\nmission, where acceleration to 15,000 m/sec is effected, still lie in the\nvery attractive range of 40 to 50% when these losses are considered.\n\nCONSTANT PRESSURE ACCELERATION OF THE ELECTROTHERMAL RAtlJET\nCharles E. Mitchell\nIntroduction\nNo ramjet engine can operate efficiently until it has been accelerated\nto some minimum operational velocity.\n\nFor the electrothermal ramjet system\n\ndlscussed in Reference 11 and elsewhere in this report this minimum operational speed is quite high.\n\nPreliminary calculations performed for a\n\nvehicle mass (m r ) of 10 kg, an acceleration rate (a) of 30,000 g, and\nemploying diatomic hydrogen as the propellant indicated that this minimum\nspeed could be as high as 5000 m/sec (Ref. 11).\n\nAlthough certain designs\n\nfacilitate ramjet operation at considerably lower speeds it is assumed conservatively in the following analysis that the starting\n\nsyste~\n\nwould have\n\nto bring the ramjet to 5000 m/sec.\nOne method of obtaining speeds of this order in short time periods at\nacceleration levels of the order of those assumed for the electrothermal\nramjet is acceleration in a light gas gun system.\n\nDevices of this type\n\nhave been both analysed and constructed and are discussed in the literature\n(see for example Ref. 13).\n\nIn what follows two acceleration systems based\n\non the light gas gun concept will be described and analysed.\n\nBoth systems\n\nare designed to produce a high level of constant acceleration (and therefore\nconstant base pressure) for the ramjet.\n\nThe mode of energy addition re-\n\nquired to produce the acceleration is taken to be similar to that assumed\nfor the ramjet mode of operation; that is, electrothermal in nature and\ncontrollable in time.\nA general description of the acceleration process will be presented\nfirst.\n\nThis will be followed by the analysis of an isentropic flow, piston\n\n-50driven dual chamber device.\nlight gas gun designs.\n\nThis type of system is typical of previous\n\nNext a non-isentropic flow, single chamber design\n\nwill be described and analysed.\n\nThis latter device differs from conventional\n\ndesigns but appears attractive in the current application.\n\nResults of\n\ncalculations for a specific example will be presented and the relative\nperformance of the two designs compared.\nUniform Acceleration Flows - General Description\nIf a constant pressure is maintained at the rear surface of the ramjet\nthen, in the absence of frictional effects, a constant acceleration of the\nramjet vehicle will occur.\n\n(It can be pointed out in passing that available\n\ndata (see Reference 14) indicate that frictional effects between the\nprojectile (ramjet) and the launch tube should cause a decrease in velocity\nobtained of about 5%.)\n\nThe basic problem is to devise a method by which a\n\nconstant ramjet base pressure can be maintained.\n\nIn Reference 11 a quasi-\n\nsteady expansion was assumed so that all the gas in back of the ramjet\n(in the launch tube) was at a constant pressure during acceleration.\n\nThe\n\nhigh pressure level necessary was to be maintained by heat addition.\n\nSince\n\nsound speeds of the order of 3000 m/sec and vehicle speeds up to 5000 m/sec\nare desired, it is clear that the quasi-steady approximation cannot be correct,\nand that the flow behind the ramjet is inherently unsteady.\nOne unsteady flow which does provide constant pressure at the ramjet\nis the flow which results if all fluid particles in back of the ramjet are\naccelerated uniformly.\n\nThat is, the gas in back of the ramjet and the\n\nramjet itself are accelerated as a solid body.\n\nConceptually, this is the\n\nflow situation which would result if the ramjet and all the gas behind it\nbegan accelerating at the constant value\nsay t\n\n=\n\nO.\n\na\n\nstarting at some arbitrary time,\n\nThe determination of the variation of the dynamic and thermo-\n\n-51-\n\ndynamic variables for this flm-/ as a function of axial location x and\ntime t is relatively straightforward.\nConsider first the pressure-distance condition which must exist at\nt\n\n= O. Since solid body acceleration is occurrings then for the gas in back\n\nof the ramjet it must be true that\ndP\ndx\nwhere P is local pressures\nthe tube at t\n\n= O.\n\np\n\no\n\n(46)\n\n=-pa.\n\nlocal density and Xo the axial distance along\n\nThis is of courses recognized as the usual gravitational\n\nequation with g replaced by a.\n\nIf a property relationship between P and\n\np\n\nis given {say isentropic or isothermal for example)then P as a function of\nXo along the tube axis could be found at t\n\n= O.\n\nFor later times the way\n\nin which the pressure must increase at any x location is determined by the\nuniform acceleration condition itself.\n\nFor any fluid particle (and for the\n\nramjet)\n(47)\n\nwhere x is the instantaneous location of the particle and Xo is its location\nat t\n\n= O.\n\nParticle paths on an x, t diagram for the case where Xo of the\n\nramjet is zero, are shown in Fig. 14.\n\nAlsos since the acceleration is\n\nuniform, the state of any fluid particle cannot change in time.\nDP = 0\n\nDt\n\n\'\n\nOs _\nDt - 0,\n\nQ\xc2\xa3.\nDt\n\n= 0\n\ns\n\nDT = 0\n\nDt\n\nThat is\n(48)\n\nwhere ~t is the material derviative and T and s are temperature and entropy,\nrespectively.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFrom Eq.

In practice this could be\n\n-54achieved through the use of a large diameter driving chamber attached to\nthe launch tube at x\n\n= O.

(64) have been suggested in the literature (Ref. 15)0\n\nIn the present\n\nanalysis it will be assumed that energy can be added to the heating chamber\nbehind the piston by electric discharge or laser addition methods similar\nto those envisioned for the electrothermal ramjet itself.\n\nIn particular it\n\nwill be assumed that the rate of energy addition can be controlled closely\nenough to meet the requirements of the piston motion presented above. The\nnecessary heat addition profile can be determined from application of the\nfirst law of thermodynamics to the heating chamber. This is\n\n-59-\n\n.\n\n(65)\n\n.\n\nwhere Q is the required heat addition rate, W is the power necessary to\nH\nH\ndU\n\nmove the piston as required by Eq. (64), and dt H is the rate of energy\nstorage in the gas in the heating chambero\nIf the piston is massless and frictionless (these effects can be\nshown to be relatively small) then\n(66)\nwith ~f determlned from Eq. (64), while\n\n(67)\n\nwhere m is the (constant) mass of gas in the heating chamber and C is the\nH\nv\nspecific heat at constant volume for the same gas. Application of the\n\n..\n\nideal gas law and substitution of Eqs. (66) and (67) into Eq.

(69) or (70) that small values of L lead to\nlarge temperature rises.\n\nThe maximum value of TH TH* still depends on\n,\nTHo\' Since THo need not be equal to Too a separate control on the maximum temperature is possible beyond that implied by the choice of L.\n\nIn\n\nthe numerical results to be presented shortly, L was taken quite arbitrarily\nto be\n\n2~0\'\n\nThis means that at t = 0 the driving chamber is separated into\n\ntwo equal volumes by the piston. Other choices of L would lead to higher\nor lower values of TH for the same THo\' As will be pointed out later\nthe choice of L also affects the performance of the device as far as energy\nconversion efficiency is concerned.\nThe efficiency of the accelerating process at any instant of time can\nbe measured by the ratio of the rate of change of the kinetic energy of the\n\n.\n\nramjet vehicle to the rate of heat addition to the heating chamber QH\'\n\nThe\n\nrate of change of the kinetic energy of the ramjet is\n\nThus, using Equation (68)\n2\n\nd(m r u /2)\n\n"=\n\n~: =y~1\n\n[[ 1 +Yilt"\n\nr-\n\n1\n1\n\n1 ]-1\n\n+2[\n\n:~ [l+(y-l)"fl]y-1\n\n(71)\n\nAC\n\nThe dependence of n on t for y = 1.4, ~ = 16, [= 2~0 = 0.1056 (L = 3.08 m)\nT\n\nis shown in Fig. 16.

That is, once the flow chokes at x = 0, the\npower to the heating chamber can be cut off while the ramjet continues at\nconstant acceleration until\n\nt = 1.708.\n\nThe period from\n\nt = 1.118\n\nto\n\nt = 1.708 thus represents a "free" acceleration period during which the overall efficiency continually increases (and n is 00).\noverall efficiency (no) is 0.0386.\n0.0901.\n\n- = -max this\nt\n\nAt t\n\nAt\n\nt = t* = 1.118\n\nthe\n\nefficiency reaches\n\nThis last value represents the overall efficiency for the complete\n\nacceleration process.\n\nDuring ramjet mode operation, the efficiency of energy\n\nconversion remains above 40%, even considering shock losses.\n\nConsequently,\n\nit seems that once the ramjet can begin operation it is to be much preferred\nover the piston driven device just described as a mass accelerator.\nPiston1ess Single Chamber Accelerator\nIn the accelerator design discussed above a separation of the heating\nchamber from the isentropic compression chamber by a piston was assumed.\nThis is consistent with the practice common in high velocity light gas gun\ndesign.\n\nThe question arises as to what would happen if the piston were\n\nsimply removed and both heating and compression occurred in a single chamber.\nCertainly a measure of design simplification would result.\n\nWhat would be\n\nthe effect on efficiency?\nIn attempting to answer this question, the first thing which becomes\nclear is that the analysis of the problem is considerably more difficult\nmathematically.\n\nThis is because the unsteady gasdynamic flow in the system\n\ncan no longer be modelled as a constant entropy (homentropic) flow.\n\nIn\n\ngeneral each fluid particle in both the chamber and the tube will have a\ndifferent entropy value associated with it since it is generated in the\nheating chamber at a different entropy.\n\nHowever, there is no reason to\n\n-64expect that the entropy of each particle, once generated, might not remain\nconstant.\nfor x\n\n>\n\nO.\n\nThat is, it seems reasonable to assume that ~~\n\n= 0, as before,\n\nThe solution for the flow field downstream of x\n\n=0\n\nstill\n\nposes a difficult problem in the method of characteristics, one that cannot\napparently be solved in closed form, but that is amenable to numerical\ntechniques (see Ref. 16).\n\nThis solution has not yet been attempted.\n\nHowever,\n\na reasonable estimate of the performance of the single chamber design, based\non the uniform acceleration model discussed earlier, can be made.\nAs before, it is assumed that a solid body type acceleration of the gas\nand ramjet occurs starting from t = 0 with the ramjet at x = O.\nis assumed Eqs.

First, the question\nof choking at x\n\n= 0,\n\nand second the "free acceleration" period which must\n\noccur after heat addition is terminated.\n\nThe question of choking does not\n\nturn out to be of major importance in this case because of the high temperatures which are present at\n\nx = O.\n\nThe Hach numer at\n\nx = 0 is\n\no _ uo _ I\nM -----\n\niro\n\naO\n\nNumerlcal integration of the governing system of equations (Eqs.

The energy exchange\nmean free path for primary electrons 1S used as a\ncriterion for determ1ning the length (Le)of this\nregion.

A\nphenomenological model descrlbing the emission and\nplasma production processes wlthin the cathode was\ndeveloped based on the results of those exper1Ments\n[2] \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe lmportant cathode processes are shown\nschematlcally ln Fig. 1. Surface electron production is from a narrow band on the downstream end of\nthe lnsert, pr1Marily from fleld-enhanced thermionlc emission.\nThese electrons are accelerated\nacross the plasma sheath and, thereby, plck up sufficlent energy to 10nlze mercury atoms (vla multlstep excitations) ln the region adjacent to the\ninsert.\nThe total dlscharge current 1S made up of\nthe sum of the currents due to both surface and\nvolume electron productl0n. The 10ns produced 1n\nthe process leave the productlon volume at the Bohm\nvelocity and are neutrallzed at lnternal cathode\npotent1al surfaces. Ions striking the lnsert surface provide the energy lnput which is required to\nmalntain the insert at the emiss10n temperature.\nBy defining an ideallzed ion production volume\nas the regl0n adjacent to the emitting portion of\nthe lnsert (lndicated by dashed llnes in Fig. 1)\nand assumlng that the plasma properties are uniform\nin that reg lon, the physlcal descriptlon above can\nbe represented analytlcally ln a rather simple\nform. The analytlcal model, as lnltlally proposed,\nwas presented ln Ref. [2] and further developed in\nRef. [3].

Equation\n1.1 also neglects electron production withln the\norlfice region and downstream of the orifice.\nExperimental results indlcate that this lS a reasonable assumption since these sources contrlbute\nonly -7% of the total discharge current.\nEquation 1.2 of Table I gives the current density J th for field-enhanced thermionic emissl0n\nfrom a surface at temperature Ts with an effectlve\nwork function of \'e. The effective work functl0n\n~e is the surface work function ~s (a material property) minus the reduction in the work function due\nto the electric fleld E at the emission surface and\ncan be calculated using Eq. 1.3. The electric\nfield in Eq. 1.3 is the field at the emission surface associated with the potential drop across the\nplasma sheath. It lS estimated based on\nthe\ntheoretical analysis presented by Prewett and Allen\n[4] for the double sheath which forms at a hot\ncathode surface emitting electrons into a plasma.\nFor the range of operatlng conditions tYPlcal of\nmercury hollow cathodes, Prewett and Allen\'s general analysis yields the approximatlon for the\nelectric field glven ln Table I by Eq. 1.4.

Rearrangement of\nthis equation gives Eq. 1.7 where J\nis the ion\ni\ncurrent density from Eq. I.S. The electron temperature is also needed here. However, nelther Eq.\n1.4 nor 1.7 is very sensitlve to the electron temperature because it appears as a square root.\nProbe measurements in the ion production region\nshow that over the normal range of mercury hollow\ncathode operation the electron temperature is reasonably constant at 0.71 \xc2\xb1 0.1 eV.\nTherefore, It\nIS suggested that this measured value be used In\nthe equations.\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \'e is the effectlve work functlon of the surface, \'s IS the surface work functlon (a material\nproperty), ~th IS the thermal power transferred\naway from the surface, Vp is the potential drop\nacross the plasma she~th, and 8 i i~ the ionizatlon\npotential. The terms qph Ae and qdx Ae are the\nenergy input due, respectlvely, to photons leaving\nthe plasma and to surface de-excltatlon of excited\natomic states.\nThe photon flux is negligible\nbecause the resonance radiation is effectively\ntrapped wlthin the plasma. The term qdxAe due to\nexcited states\nis belleved to be relatlvely\nsmall though not necessarily negliglble.\nCalculation of thiS term and various factors affecting it\nwill be discussed In more detal1 In the last section of thls paper. The term 0th In Eq. 2 IS the\nthermal power lost from the Insert. In general, it\nis a function of the insert temperature Ts and must\nbe estimated for the speclfic cathode thermal configuration on the basis of conductlon and radiation\nfrom\nthe\nInsert.\nNeglecting\nthe\nterms\nqd xAe and qp hA e in Eq. 2 and solving for the ion\ncurrent density J glves Eq. I.S of Table I. In\ni\nexpressing Eq. I.S In terms of the total discharge\ncurrent In\' Eq. 1.1 was used along with the fact\nthat the total surface area of the ion production\nregion is As=Ae+2Ac where Ac is the area of the end\nboundary of the region.\n\nTo complete the model one requires a means of\nestimating the length of the 10n production reglon.\nThlS length is determined by the\ncollis10nal\nprocesses taklng place within the lon productlon\nregion. Energy input to the ion production region\noccurs mainly through the current of primary electrons emitted from the insert. The dominant energy\nexchange paths for a primary electron entering this\nregion are inelastic colllsions with a mercury atom\n(typically 10 9 collisions per second) and elastic\ncoillsions with Maxwellian electrons (typically lOS\ncollisions per second).\nThe elastic coillsion\ncross-section for an electron-electron colllslon IS\nproportional to the inverse square of the proJectile electron\'s energy. Therefore, once a primary\nelectron gives up energy, either by small angle\nelastic or by inelastlc collisions, it\'s collision\nrate increases and it is rapidly thermalized, losing it\'s identity as a primary. The fact that the\nprimary electrons are required for the excltation\nreactions which sustain the plasma discharge suggests the length of the ion production region is\nprobably on the order of the primary electron\nenergy exchange mean free path. Primaries can lose\nenergy both by elastic collisions over a mean free\npath of AEI and by inelastic colllslons over a mean\nfree path of A \xe2\x80\xa2 Therefore, the effective mean\nln\nfree path for the loss of a primary electron would\nbe\n\nThe plasma potential is estimated by a siml1ar\nenergy\nbalance on the ion production region.\nEnergy is convected Into and out of this volume by\nthe motlon of the varl0US partlcle speCles crossing\nthe boundarles of the ion production region.\nThis\nparticle motl0n transports not only the random and\ndirected kinetic energy of the partlcles but also\ntheir excitation potentlal energy. Again neglecting the energy flux d~e to excited state atoms qdx\nand due to radiation qph leaving the volume, the\nenergy balance can be written slmply as\n\nV Ie\np\n\nA\n\npr\n\n(3)\n\nFrom where they are created, primary electrons will\nbe scattered upstream to some extent by elastlc\ncollisions. Therefore, a reasonable criterion for\nthe length of the ion production region IS probably\none to two primary electron energy exchange mean\nfree paths.\nIt wl11 be seen in the next section\nthat a length of two mean free paths gives the best\nagreement with experimental results.\nThis criterion is indicated In Table I by Eq.I.S.\n\nHere Vple is the rate at which energy is brought\ninto the volume by the prlmary (surface emitted)\nelectrons, 8 1 IS the rate at which energy leaves\n1 1\nthe volume In the form of 10nized atoms, and\n(S/2 kTeln) IS the rate at WhlCh energy leaves the\nvolume due to the convectl0n of Maxwellian electrons through the orifice ( S/2 kTe is the enthalpy\nof the Maxwelllan electron gas).\nOther energy\nterms such as the directed klnetic energy and\nenthalpy of the ions and neutrals can be shown to\nbe small [3] and are neglected. USlng the current\nbalance of Eq. 1.1 and solving Eq. 3 for Vp results\nin Eq. 1.6 of Table I.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(4)\n\nThe primary electron mean free path criterlon\nas well as the concept of an ion production region\nare clearly idealizations. The extent of the 10n\nproduction region in reality will not be sharply\ndefined; properties will not be uniform throughout\nthe region and ionization will occur upstream of\nthe boundary. In addition, ions produced In the\nregion will diffuse upstream, heating the Insert in\nthe region upstream of the boundary.\nSo far the\ndiffusion of ions upstream has not been discussed,\nalthough to be consistent with the model, the\n\nCalculation of the electric field E using\nEquation 1.4 requires values for the plasma denslty\nn and the electron temperature T. Assuming that\ntte plasma density (n\nnil IS iniform throughout\ne\n\n=\n\n79\n\n8\n\nplasma density must falloff rapidly upstream of\nthe boundary. If this were not the case, significant 10n heating of the insert and related electron\nemission would be expected to occur upstream of the\nboundary defined by the mean free path cr1terion.\nE%perimental plasma density prof11es show that, in\nfact, the axial plasma density drops off e%ponent1ally in the upstream direct10n.\nThis ind1cates\nthat Significant ion heating probably does not\nextend far upstream of the ion product10n region\nand is consistent with the observed rapid falloff\nin surface temperature upstream of the em1ssion\nregion.\nThis observed behavior is also in agreement with calculations based on amb1polar d1ffusion\nof the 10ns and electrons. Such calculat10ns show\nthat, by itself, volume recomb1nation in the plasma\ncan result in a dens1ty decrease upstream of the\nproduction region more rapid than that observed\ne%per1mentally.\nIn the real situation, of course,\nboth volume ionization and wall recombination are\nalso tak1ng place in conjunction with volume recombination to determ1ne the actual plasma density\nprofile in this upstream reg10n.\n\nE\n.5\n\n6\n\nW\nW\n\na:: 4\n\nLL\n\nZ\n\n<l\nW\n\n~\n\nU\n\n;:: 2\n\n\'"\n...J\n\n<l\n\nUJ\n\n~\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFig. 2\n\n= _ _L_\n\nIn\nI:na\nj\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n5XIO"\n\nEffect of Total Neutral Atom Density\non Primary Electron Inelastic Mean\nFree Path\n\nsiderable range, the mean free path for inelastic\ncollisions was found to be sensitive only to total\nneutral density and to primary electron energy.\nThe Maxwellian electron density ne was also found\nto have a sl1ght effect on A \xe2\x80\xa2\nHowever, this\nIn\neffect is rather small amounting to an increase 1n\nAIn of less than 20~ when electron density 1S\nincreased by a factor of five.

The presence of the cathode orifice plate\nsimplifies this problem somewhat because most of\nthe pressure drop is across the orifice and the\npressure w1t~in the cathode cavity upstream of the\nor1fice is essentially constsnt. The total pressure at any point 1n the cathode is the sum of the\npartial pressures of each species.

The local\npressure P used in Eq. 1.10 is determined from a\ncorrelation of exper1mental results based on actual\npressure measurements made over a wide range of\nmass flow rates, discharge currents, and orifice\ndiameters [3]. This correlation is shown in Table\nI as Eq. 1.11 where the units are P (Torr),\n(mA\nequivalent), do (mm) and IO{A). It is believed to\nbe accurate to within \xc2\xb13~.\n\nchemical R-SOO*.

The primary electron mean free path Apr\nwas calculated with Eg. 1.9 for the experimental\nconditions. In making these calculations, the neutral density was estimated from the\nmeasured\ncathode pressure using Eq. 1.10 and the primary\nelectron energy was taken to be 8.7 eV.\nThe primary electron energy could have been estimated\nusing Eq. 1.6, but it will be seen shortly that\nthis underestimates the plasma potential by -2V.\nThe value of 8.7 eV was chosen on the basis of\nplasma property measurements [3] which showed that\nover the range of normal operating conditions for\nthis size cathode, the plasma potential in the ion\nproduction region is nearly constant at 8.7 \xc2\xb1O.S V.\nThe results of the mean free path calculation\ndiscussed above are plotted as the solid curve\n(2Apr) in F1g. 4. Insert emission lengths determined from the experimental results are indicated\nin the figure as circles.\nThe agreement between\nthe experimental data points and the calculated\ncurve is quite good and supports the assumption of\nthe model that Le/Apr is approximately two. The\ndata points above four Torr would have been in even\ncloser agreement with the curve except that there\nwas no way 1n this experiment to discriminate emission lengths shorter than the 2.2 mm long insert\nsegment.\nInsert emission lengths, for condit10ns\n\nm,\n\nG1ven the mass flow rate\nthe orifice diameter do, the insert dumeter D, the total discharge\ncurrent ~, the surface work function ~\n, the\ninsert thermal power loss 0th\' and theSphysical\nconstants {e, k, m , 8 , 8 , a " the equations in\ni\no\ni\n0\nTable I can be solved for all of the o~her parameters except the electron temperature.

However, the equations converge to a solution very rapidly (five place accuracy in six or seven iterations). The results of\ncalculations based on this set of equations will be\ncompared with experimental results in the next section.\n\n..\n\n.\n\nTest Cathode for Current Accounting\n\nAn earlier paper describes an experiment in\nwhich a special quartz tube test cathode was used\nto determine the magn1tude and origin of the various hollow cathode currents [2]. The predictions of\nthe model will be compared here with the results of\nthat exper1ment.\n\nA schematic of the test cathode used in the\nexperiment is shown in Fig.3.\nThe cathode was\nfabricated from a quartz tube such that all of the\ninternal surfaces were covered with tantalum foil\nand each surface of 1nterest was isolated as a\nseparate electrode. The insert was 2.2 mm long and\nhad a diameter of 3.9 mm. The cathode had an orifice diameter of 0.96 mm. Both the 1nsert and the\ncathode tube were coated with the low work function\n\n*\n\n81\n\nA double carbonate mixture - (Ba/Sr) 00 3 manufactured by the J.R.

A probable explanation for this discrepancy is that the effective\ndiameter of the tantalum, foil-lined orifice\nwas slightly smaller during operatIon than its\nmeasured diameter when cold. A small error in\nthe orifice diameter results In a large error\nin pressure because it appears in Eq.

The value of 1.94 eV\nused in the calculation was arbItrarily chosen\nfrom this range to give agreement between the\nmeasured and the calculated temperature at the\noperating conditions where ID was 3.3 A and\nwas -100 mAo The comparison between calculated\nand measured temperatures WIll, therefore, be a\nrelative one valid mainly for checking the\nfunctional dependence on discharge current and\npressure predIcted by the model.\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\nINTERNAL\n\nFIg. 4\n\n3\n\nPRESSURE\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n(Torr)\n\nComparIson of EmIssion Length with\nPrimary Electron Energy Exchange\n)lean Free Path\n\nwhere emIssion was taking place not only from the\nInsert (surface 2) but also from the cathode tube\n(surface I), were estimated by assuming that the\ncurrent density for emIssion from the tube was the\nsame as the measured average current density of the\n2.2 mm long Insert at that same conditIon.\nIt is worth noting here that, for operation at\na typical internal cathode pressure of -3 Torr, the\n2mm emission length is the same as the cathode\ninsert radius.\nThese conditIons correspond to a\npressure-diameter product of -1 Torr-cm.\nIt is\nInteresting\nto compare this with experimental\nresults reported by Lidsky et al. (7) for an open\ntube cathode.\nWorking with a number of different\ngases (H2 , H , A, N ), they determined experimen2\ntally that t~e emission region locates itself where\nthe local pressure-diameter product IS -1 Torr-cm.\nA pressure-diameter product of this magnItude\ncorresponds to a primary eleotron mean free path\nwhich IS on the order of the cathode radius. In\nthe open tube cathode, the local pressure varIes\nsIgnIficantly along the tube. It IS reasonable in\nthis situatIon that the Ion production regIon\nlocates itself where conditions are such that primary electrons can reach the centerline of the\ncathode.\nIn the orificed hollow cathode, on the\nother hand, most of the pressure drop occurs across\nthe orIfIce plate so that the pressure WIthin the\ntube IS rather constant along the aXIs of the\ncathode and can be adjusted Independently without\nsignificantly affecting the emiSSIon\nlocation.\nHowever, a primary electron mean free path on the\norder of the insert radIUS is probably a desireable\noperatIng condItIon here as well. This is so even\nthough the or if iced cathode can be forced to\noperate under conditIons both WIth shorter and\nlonger pr1mary electron mean free paths.\nThat a\nprimary electron mean free path on the order ot an\nInsert radius is a deslreable operatIng condItIon\nIS also suggested by experimental results [1,8)\nwhich show that a keeper/dIscharge voltage minImum\nwill occur at a pressure-diameter product of a few\nTorr-cm.\n\nm\n\n3)\n\nThe thermal power loss used for the calculations was taken from the dashed curve of Fig.\nA.1 in AppendIX A.\n\n4)\n\nThe electron temperature was assumed to be the\naverage measured value of 0.71 eV.\n\n5)\n\nThe ratio of emission length to mean free\nLe/Apr was assumed to be two.\n\npath\n\nThe results of calculations using the model\nbased on the assumptions discussed above are shown\nin Figs.

This\ndifference may be attributable, at least partially,\nto the assumptl0n in the model of a uniform ion\nproductl0n region. This assumption is expected to\nhold best for operation at conditions where the\nprimary electron mean free path is on the order of\nthe insert radius.\nAs the internal pressure is\nincreased beyond this pOint (a few Torr), the primary electrons have a lower probability of reachlng\nthe centerline of the cathode, so that ion production is increasingly confined to an annular region\nbounded by the emissl0n surface (as opposed to the\nassumed cylindrical volume). Such a reduction in\nvolume could account for the fact that the average\nmeasured values of the plasma density adjacent to\nthe orifice plate are nearly constant for pressures\nabove a few Torr (Fig. 6b).\n\nThe ion productlon region plasma\ndensity\npredicted by the mOd9}ottf pl..<:.tUd in Fig. 6a as a\nfunction of dlscharge ~urren\\.

The excited state energy\nflux based on those assumptions was found to be\nrather large [3] and gave predictlns for both\nplasma density and plasma potential which were not\nrealistic. On the other hand, the results in Figs.\n6 and 7 lndlcate that the model predlcts plasma\ndensitles and plasma potentials of the right magnltude\nwhen\nthe\nexclted state power term lS\nneglected. (In both cases the model would provide\nbetter agreement if some fraction of the calculated\nexcited state power were included - 0 to 30~). The\nover estimation of the exclted state energy flux\nmay be due to a number of factors. For example, lt\nmay be that the exclted state densities near the\nboundary and, therefore, the particle fluxes are\nactually over estimated.\nAnother possibllity lS\nthat the partlcle fluxes are estimated correctly\nbut that there is some mechanlsm for returning\nenergy to the volume, such as reflection of excited\nparticles or of resonance radlation from cathode\nsurfaces. However, even in light of these\nuncertaintles assoclated with calculation of the exclted\nstate energy flux, the model provides a useful and\nreasonable qualitative description of the basic\nphysical processes taking place withln the cathode.\n\nFlnally, the plasma potential predlctlons of\nthe model are shown in Figs. 7a and 7b where they\nare plotted, respectlvely, as a\nfunction\nof\ndlscharge current at a constant mass flow rate\n(-100 mAl, and as a function of lnternal pressure\nat a constant dlscharge current (3.3A). Although\nthe plasma potential was not measured in this\nexperlment, results from Langmuir probe measurements made during another experiment on a similar\ncathode showed that the plasma potential in the ion\nproductlon reglon was -S.7V [3]. The average measured value of S.7V from that experiment lS lndicated ln the Figs. 7a and 7b as the dashed line.\nThe value is shown as a constant (horizontal line)\nbecause the probe measurements indicated no clear\ncorrelation of the plasma potential in the ion\nproduction reglon with either current or pressure.\n16\nMASS FLOW RATE\nORIFICE DIAMETER\n\n>\n_l\n\n<[\n\n-100 mA\n096 mm\n\n12\n\nIZ\n\nw\n\nl-\n\n0\n\na.\n\nS\n\n\'------,------\n\nC\n\n<[\n\n:::;:\nen\n<[\n\nBased on the above experimental results, lt lS\nsuggested that for design purposes the average\nmeasured values ot the electron temperature (0.71\neV) and plasma potential (S.7V) should be used when\nmaking calculations with the model.\nThe results\nalso indicate that the best agreement between model\nand experiment is obtained when the ion production\nregion aspect ratio (OIL) is on the order of two.\nThis is also a condition :hich lS expected to provide good cathode performance.\n\nTHEORETICAL\n\n4\n\n_l\n\na.\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nDISCHARGE CURRENT (A)\n\nFlg. 7a\n\n16\n\n>\n_l\n\n<[\n\nEffect of Dlscharge Current on\nCalculated and Measured\nPlasma Potentlals\nDISCHARGE CURRENT\nORIFICE DIAMETER\n\nConclusions\n\n33A\n096mm\n\nA phenomenological model has been presented\nwhich describes the physical processes underlYlng\nthe operation of mercury orificed hollow cathodes\nof the type used in lon thrusters.

The results can be used to design\naccelerating systems ln WhlCh the dlrectlon and\nfocus of emerglng beamlets are important. Deflectlon and divergence angle data were collected for\ntwo-grid systems as a function of the relatlve displacement of these grids. At large displacements,\naccelerator grld implngement becomes a llmlting\nfactor and thlS deflnes the useful range of beamlet\ndeflectlon. Beamlet deflectlon was found to vary\nllnearly wlth grld offset angle over this range.\nValues of deflection-to-offset angle ratio and useful range of defl ection are gwen as functions of\ngrld-hole geometrles, perveance levels, and accelerating voltages. The dlvergence of the beamlets\nwas found to be unaffected by deflectlon over the\nuseful range of beamlet deflectlon. The grids of a\ntYPlcal dished-grld ion thruster are examlned to\ndetermine where over the grld surface the grid offsets exceed the useful range. ThlS deflnes the\nreglons on thlS surface where high accelerator grld\nlmplngement is probably occurrlng.\n\nThe study of grJd translatlon effects on lon\nOptlCS has two lmportant applications ln the\ndesign of electrostatlc thrusters. First, for a\ndlshed grld pair, hole mlsallgnments are used to\nredlrect the emerglng beamlets in order to minlmlze\noff-axis thrust. A study that would yield correlatlons or a model of this phenomenon would facllltate design of these grlds. Second, for fome\napplicatlons a vectorable beam lS deslred and grld\ntranslation is one method of produclng a moderate\nthrust vectorlng capabllity. In addltlon, beam\nfocuslng may be desirable to lncrease the current\ndenslty ln 2uch ground-based applicatlons as\nsputterlng. Agaln a model or correlatlons descrlblng the effects of hole misalignment on grld\noptics would be useful in designlng the hardware\nneeded for these tasks.\nWork done by Aston 3 ,4 has shown the effects of\nsuch parameters as grld separatlon, grid hole dlameter and net-to-total acceleratlng voltage ratlo\non the optlcal performance of a two-grld system with\nallgned apertures. Optical performance in this\ncontext was deflned as the beamlet dlvergence variatlon with beam current as well as the maximum\nperveance that could be obtained before accel erator\ngrid implngement became exceSSlve. The present\nstudy of grid translation lS intended to examlne\nthe effects of grid geometry and operating parameters on grid performance for vectored beams.

This masking of the gr1ds results in very\nun, form plasma propert1es at each aperture and\nhence a uniform beam. The thruster uses a tungsten\nfilament for both the main and neutralizer cathodes\nand it operates with argon as the propellant.\nThe gr1ds are fabr1cated from graphite sheets\nwith a nineteen hole array arranged in a hexagonal\npattern on them. A screen gr1d hole diameter of\n2.06 mm was selected for the study and mica sheets\nwere used to ma1ntain the spacing between the gr1ds.\nWhile the accelerator 1S held f1xed, the screen\ngr1d can be translated along one axis dur1ng thrus-\n\n(4)\n\nthe theoret1cal 11m1t1ng value of normalized perveance per hole 1S glven by\n88\n\n.,\n\nter operatlon by a mechanlcal system in the manner\nsuggested by Fig. 2.

Twenty of these probes are situated along\na horlzontal llne 14 cm downstream from the grids.\nIn add1tion, a llne of probes extends vertically\ndownward from each end of the horizontal probe rake.\nBy uSlng these three probe rakes it lS possible to\nlntercept the full beam prof11e over the complete\nrange of grid translatlon.

These results showed the linear relationship between the\ngrid offset angle (e) and the deflection angle (a)\nsuggested by Eq. 10 but, inconsistencies were\nobserved when data from various runs were compared.\nIt was determlned that these inconsistencies were\ndue ln part at least to variations in ion source\noperatlng conditions that occurred whlle the probe\ncurrents were belng read. In order to mlnimize\nthlS drlft the manual data collection was ellminated\nin favor of automated collectlon using a Hewlett\nPackard 3054 Data Logger. Results obtalned using\nthe data logger have been very reproducible and\nself-conslstent.\nIn order to isolate the effects of varlOUS\nparametrlc changes to be lntroducted in the experiment a standard grid geometry was selected and then\none grid parameter was varied while other parameters\nwere held at their standard value. The standard\ncase selected lS defined by the followlng geometrical and operating conditlons:\n\n\xc2\xb1k\n8em\n\nangle between the thruster axis and the line from\nthe screen grid center through the point of maXlmum\ncurrent density. Next the two segments of the current density profile on either side of the maximum\nare averaged and the total beam current is estlmated by integrating thlS average profile for an\nassumed axi-symmetric distribution about the line\nof maximum current density. The deflectlon angle\nvalue which best fits the data lS then obtalned by\niterating assumed deflection angle values and\nsolving for the minlmum integrated beam current.\nThe final beam current obtained in the analysis is\nthen compared to the measured beam current to insure that they agree to within 5 to 10%. The dlvergence angle (a in F1g. 1) is computed as the\nhalf angle of the cone encloslng 95% of the integrated beam current determined in the aforementioned\nanalysis. ThlS definition of half angle is the same\nas the one used by Aston 3,4 in the study of divergence characteristics of aligned grlds.\n\nA complete set of beam prof11es 1S collected\nby flrst achlevlng stable ion source operatlon wlth\nthe screen grid dlsplaced to produce a sUbstantial\nnegative lon beam deflectlon. Once the lon beam\nhas been probed, the screen grid lS dlsplaced ln\n0.05 mm lncrements and the beam lS probed after each\ndisplacement. This process contlnues untll the beam\nis dlsplaced sufficlently poslt1ve so the accelerator grld impingement current reaches ~ 25% of the\nbeam current. Since a grid dlsplacement of 0.05 mm\nhas been shown to produce measurable beam deflection,\ncareful alignment of the grids in the direction\nperpendicular to the direct10n of grid translation\nand reduction of play ln the movable grid are crucial to the generatlon of accurate data \xe2\x80\xa2\nBeam current dens1ty proflles are analyzed\nuS1ng a computer routlne.

As the R-value decreased from 0.90\nto 0.35, Slo lncreased from 0.4 to 0.6, as shown\nin Fig. 12. Th1s is explalned by consldering that\nat a constant total voltage, a decrease in the\nR-value 1S accompan1ed by a decrease ln the net\nacceleratlon voltage and hence 1n the ion velocity.\nThe lon 1s then subjected to the 1ens effect of the\naccelerator aperture for a longer time and thlS results in a larger deflection angle for a given grid\nd1sp1acement. The deflection angle ranges as depicted ln Fig. 13, show only a Sllght dependence on\nthe R-value as long as it is greater than about 0.5 \xe2\x80\xa2\nWhen the R-value 1S reduced to about 0.35 however\nthe deflection range becomes more restrlcted at the\nh1gher perveances. This effect lS presumably due to\nthe fact that beamlets wh1ch become more dlvergent\nat low R-values begln to 1ntercept the accelerator\ngrld at a lesser grld offset angle.\n\nAs shown in Flg. 14, the accelerator grid\nthickness had no slgniflcant effect on the deflection-to-offset angle ratio. However, in Fig. 15 the\nthick accelerator grid 1S seen to exhlbit a pronounced reduction ln def1ectlon angle range. This\n1S considered to be due to the fact that interception of the beamlet on the downstream edge of\nthe accelerator grid occurs at a much smaller grid\nd1splacement with the thickest grid. It is noteworthy that a very thin accelerator grid showed no\nimprovement in the deflection angle range over that\nobserved for the standard case thickness.\n10\nI,\n\n... oe\n\n-\n\nS\n\nT.\n6012\n037(STOCASE)\no 074\n\no\n\nARGON\nVT -600V\n\n.!t\nd,\n\n-049\n\n..!!!... 0\nd,\n\n64\n\ni . ols\nd,\nR .070\n\n~\n\n~\nC\n\n06\n\n~\n\n~\nc:\n,\n\ng\n\n04\n\n15\n\n~\n\n02\n\n~~--------~I--------~2--------~3--------~4kIO\xc2\xb7\nNORMAUZED PERV[ANCE PER HOLE\n\n(A I v 1.\\ )\n\nFig. 14.

Th1S\nchange had only a Sllght effect on the beamlet deflect10n characterist1cs. A Sllght reduct10n 1n\ndeflect10n range was observed for the thicker screen\ngr1d as 111ustrated in F1g. 16. This 1S supported\nby previous work by Aston 3 Wh1Ch shows that th1nner\nscreen gr1d geometr1es are capable of ach1ev1ng\nsllghtly h1gher perveances. Th1S is consistent w1th\nthe fact that the th1nner screen gr1d exh1b1ts a\nSllghtly higher deflect10n angle range at a glven\nperveance level. There appears to be a Sllght difference 1n the deflection-to-offset rat10 for d1fferent screen gr1d thicknesses as shown 1n F1g. 17.\n\nAn inspection of Eq. 8, Wh1Ch pertains to\nlinear Opt1CS theory, reveals that the total acceleration voltage does not appear so th1S parameter would not be expected to affect the beamlet\ndeflection parameters to f1rst order. F1gures 18\nand 19 do show however that these parameters were\naffected somewhat by a change 1n total accelerat1ng\nvoltage from 600 v to 1100 v. F1gure 18 reveals a\nlarger deflection angle range over the complete\nperveance range at the h1gher voltage. Figure 19\nshows that wh11e the magn1tudes of the def1ect1onto-offset angle rat10 are comparable at the two\nvoltages, changes 1n perveance seem to 1nduce a\ngreater change 1n th1S ratio at the h1gher voltage.\nIt should be noted that some of the data on\nF1gS. 18 and 19 involved operat1on of the ion\nsource at a S11ghtly h1gher d1scharge voltage and\nmagnet current. Th1S d1d not appear to alter the\ndata trends.

This ind1cates the impingement levels w111 be low over the entire accelerator\ngrid surface in th1S case. For the greater d1Sh\ndepth curves however the allowed prof11es fall below the estimated ones at the greater rad11. In\nth1S case 1mp1ngement would be expected to be more\nsubstant1al.

As seen 1n Figs. 22 and 23 realt1vely large\noffset angles may be required for the apertures at\nthe outer edges of the grids on large d1ameter\nthrusters. Because of the flatter plasma density\nprofiles in multipole thrusters, these outer radius\nholes may be expected to operate at h1gher perveance\nvalues and this would be expected to create even\nmore severe 1mp1ngement problems when the beamlets\nare re-directed parallel to the thruster axis than\nwas observed 1n Fig. 24 for the 30 em divergent\nfield thruster.\nConcl usion\nIon beamlet deflect10ns of several degrees can\nbe accomplished by d1splacing the screen and accelerator gr1d holes relative to each other. Th1S\ndeflect10n is 11m1ted to a useful range by the onset of high accelerator grid 1mp1ngement currents.\nThis range is pr1marily dependent on the perveance\nat which the grid 1S operating and the diameter of\nthe accelerator gr1d aperture. The useful range is\n\nalso dependent to a lesser extent on the net-tototal voltage ratio, gr1d separation distance, grid\nth1cknesses, and the total accelerat1ng voltage.\nOver the useful range of beam deflect10ns the beamlet d1vergence angle 1S independent of deflection.\nIn th1S range the deflect10n angle 1S also a l1near\nfunct10n of the gr1d offset angle. The constant of\nproportlonal1ty between these angles exhiblts a\ndependence on the net-to-total accelerating ratlo\nbut 1S relatlvely lndependent of the other parameters studied.

Brophy** and Paul J. Wilbur+\nColorado State Un1vers1ty\nFort Collins, Colorado 80523\n\nAbstract\nThe flex1ble magnetic field thruster is a\nunlque research tool for studYlng the behavior of\ndlrect current electron-bombardment thrusters. It\nut1lizes a long W1re anode sh1elded by a circumferentlal magnetlc field. The magnetic fleld\naround the anode, WhlCh 1S produced by passing a\ndirect current of up to 150 amperes through the\nwire, restrlcts prlmary electron flow from the discharge plasma to the anode. D1fferent magnetic\nfleld configuratlons can be created by routing the\nanode wire ln various ways through the dlscharge\nchamber. Divergent, cusped and multlpole magnetlc\nf1eld conf1gurat1ons have been created 1n th1S manner. The thruster is al so designed so ion currents\nto varlOUS internal surfaces can be measured directly\nand these measurements facllltate calculatlon of\nthe dlstribution of ion currents wlthin the dlScharge chamber. Experlments lndlcate that the\ndistrlbutlon of ion currents inslde the dlscharge\nchamber lS strongly dependent on the shape and\nstrength of the magnetlc field but lndependent of\nthe dlscharge current, dlscharge voltage, and neutral flow rate. Measurements of the energy cost\nper plasma lon indlcate that thlS cost decreases\nwith 1ncreasing magnet1c fleld strength due to increased anode shleldlng from the primary electrons.\nEnergy costs per argon plasma ion as low as 50 eV\nwere measured. The energy cost per beam lon was\nfound to be a functlon of the energy cost per\nplasma lon, extracted lon fraction and dlscharge\nvoltage. Part of the energy cost per beam ion goes\ninto creatlng many lons in the plasma and then extractlng only a fraction of them lnto the beam. The\nrest of the energy goes lnto accelerat1ng the remalning plasma lons lnto the walls of the discharge\nchamber. Measurement of lon fluxes across a virtual\nanode surface appear to lndicate that lons cross\nthis surface with velocities approachlng thelr\nrandom thermal veloclty rather than the Bohm\nvelocity.\nIntroductlon\nA great deal of effort has been expended over\nthe last two decades on research to lmprove the\nefflclency of electron-bombardment lon thrusters.\nMuch of thlS effort has centered on the containment\nof the hlgh energy or prlmary electrons ln the main\ndlscharge region of the thrusters, and has resulted\nln a rather 1nteresting evolution of the thruster\nmagnetic field conflgurations .1,2 In spite of this\neffort the energy cost per beam ion (In electron\nvolts) for most thrusters is still on the order of\n\n** Research Asslstant, Department of Mechanical\nEngineerlng.\n+ Professor, Department of Mechanlcal Engineer-\n\nlng, Member AIAA.\nR~I \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 sed\n\nDugan and Sovie 9 have shown that the energy\nrequired to produce an argon ion in plasm~ simllar\nto that commonly found in ion thrusters should be\non the order of 50 eVe That this energy is greater\n(by approxlmately a factor of 3) than the 10nlZatlOn\npotentlal 15 due primarily to the fact that the lonlzation process lS accompanied by some excltatlon of\nthe neutral atoms. Inherent ln thlS analysls is the\nassumptlon that electrons lose energy through Inelastic collis1ons w1th the neutral atoms excluslvely, l.e. that electron energy losses to the\nwalls are negliglble. In the case of ion thrusters,\nthlS condltlon is approxlmately satisfled when the\nprimary electrons are prevented from reaching the\nanode by a magnetic field and when only low energy\nelectrons are removed from the plasma at the anode.\nThus, lt should be expected that a properly deslgned\nion thruster (l.e., one which prevents primary electrons from havlng direct access to the anode) would\nproduce argon ions in the plasma at an approxlmate\nenergy cost of 50 eVe\nThlS lndicates that the high energy cost per\nbeam ion of typical thrusters is not the result of\nlnefficient plasma ion production, but rather lt lS\nthe result of the fact that the fractlon of these\nlons being extracted lnto the beam is substantlally\nless than unity. If every lon produced in the\nplasma was extracted lnto the beam, the thruster\nwould be operating at a discharge power level of\n50 eV/beam ion (50 watts/beam ampere). Th1S lS\nprobably the maXlmum energy efflciency that could\nbe expected for an argon thruster.\nTo approach thlS maximum efficlency one must\nunderstand the behavior of, and be able to control,\nthe ion currents inside the discharge chamber. The\nflexible magnetic field thruster was developed to\nstudy the behavior of these lon currents. The\nunlque features of this thruster are that it allows\ndrastic changes in ltS magnetlc field conflguratlon\nto be accomplished quickly and easily, and that lt\nis designed so ion currents can be measured to ltS\nvarious lnterlor surfaces. Changes ln magnetlc\nfield configuration are made possible through the\nuse of a copper wire anode through which a direct\n\n* Work performed under NASA Grant NGR-06-002-1l2.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n15 to 30 tlmes the flrst ionlzation potential energy of the propellent atoms.+ For example, the\nJ-serles thruster 3 uSlng mercury, operates wlth a\ndischarge power of 190 eV/beam ion at a beam current of 2 amps and a 32 volt discharge. This is a\nfactor of 18 greater than the first lonization potentlal for mercury. For SERT 114 thlS factor is\nabout 22.

From these\ndata the total lon productlon rate, energy cost per\nplasma ion and extracted ion fraction were calculated. In this study these performance parameters\nwere monltored as magnetic fleld configuration and\nstrength, discharge current, discharge voltage and\nneutral flow rate were varied.\n\nThe basic stainless steel, sheet metal chamber\nused to house the anodes in this study lS shown\nschematically wlthout an anode in Flgure 1d.

Each of these conflgurations was easily created with the f1exlble fle1d\nthruster. Flgure 1 shows these conflguratlons and\nhow the anode Wlre must bend In order to create\neach particular magnetlc fle1d shape. In each of\nthese three conflgurations the loop separatlon was\napproximately 2 cm and the total anode length exposed to the plasma was 280 cm. In addltlon, the\nvolume and surface area of the reglon bounded by\nthe anode was the same for each conflguratlOn. The\neffect of increasing the magnetlc fle1d strength\nfor the dIvergent field thruster conflguratlon IS\nlllustrated In Fig. 2. In this flgure the fractlons\nof total Ion current produced (J p) whIch go to; the\nback surface (Jback/Jp)\' the sIde wall (Jside/Jp\'),\nthe screen grid (Jscreen/JQ)\' and the beam (JB/~p)\nare plotted as functlons of norma1lzed magnetic\nfield current through the anode wIre. These data\nwere taken at a discharge current of 2.0 A, a dlscharge voltage of 50 V and a neutral flow rate of\n1580 mAeq. However, It was found that the lon current dlstrlbution In the dlscharge chamber was independent of discharge current, dlscharge voltage,\nand neutral flow rate over the ranges lnvestlgated.\nBecause of this Independence from dlscharge condltlons, the curves shown In FIg. 2 can be consldered\ngenerally applIcable to the dlvergent magnetic fle1d\nconfiguration. Examinatlon of Flg. 2 IndIcates that\nthe fractlon of the total lon current extracted In\nthe beam lncreases wlth IncreasIng field current.\nIn addition, the fractlons of the total Ion current\ngOlng to the back surface and screen grld lncrease\nslIghtly while that to the slde wall decreases.\nThis IS clear eVldence that the magnetlc fle1d\nstrength can lnf1uence the dlstrlbutlon of Ion currents inslde the discharge chamber. The decrease\nIn the fractIon of Ion current to the sIde wall IS\nbelIeved to be primarl1y the result of a radial\nplasma denslty dlstributlon In the dlscharge chamber\nthat becomes lncreasing1y non-unlform as the fle1d\ncurrent IS increased. Most of the Ion current gOlng\nto the back surface IS assumed to be gOIng there\nthrough the "hole" in the magnetic fIeld on the\ncenterlIne of the thruster.\nThe dlstrlbutlon of Ion currents for the cusped\nfIeld thruster (Fig. 1b) configuration IS shown In\nFig. 3. Again the fractions of Ion currents to each\nsurface are plotted against the norma1lzed magnetic\nfle1d current.

These and other data Ind1cate that\nthe energy cost per plasma Ion can be made as low\nas 50 to 60 eV for the argon propellant used.\nIn the course of measur1ng the total 10n productIon rate 1t was notIced that this rate was\nfrequently much greater than the neutral flow rate\nIn equIvalent mIllIamperes. An example of th1S IS\nshown 1n FIg. 7 for data collected on the cusped\nfield thruster. The ion productIon rate beIng\ngreater than the neutral flow rate is an IndIcation\nthat the walls of the dIscharge chamber behave as a\nvIrtual source of propellent atoms.

ThIS fIgure IndIcates rather dramat1cally how the 10n product10n\nrate can be Slgn1flcantly greater than the neutral\nflow rate and yet the beam current lS still s1gn1flcantly less than the flow rate. ThIS does not mean,\nhowever, that If every Ion produced could be extracted Into the beam that one would get a beam current greater than the flow rate. Instead, the\nneutral denSIty would decrease caus1ng a correspondIng decrease 1n the 10n productIon rate such that\nthe beam current (assumIng only singly charged ions)\nwould always be less than the neutral flow rate.\nOther ConsIderatIons\nIn addItIon to the tests descr1bed above,\nseveral other conf1gurat10ns of the fleXIble fIeld\nthruster Vlere tested 1n an effort to reduce Ion\nlosses to the walls st111 further.

To date,\nno confIguratIon of the fleXIble fIeld thruster has\ndIrected a greater fractIon of Ions toward the grIds\nthan the d1vergent f1eld conf1gurat10n. However,\n104\n\nIn the course of this effort a very 1nterest1ng\nphenomenon was observed. Tests were bel ng run on the\nflexible f1eld thruster In an aX1al magnetIc fIeld\nconf1guratlon as shown in FIg. 8. In addlt10n to\nthe solenOIdal anode the thruster was eqUIpped WIth\nan external soleno1d. ThlS allowed the magnetic\nfIeld In the d1scharge chamber to be created by 1 )\npass1ng a current through the anode wIre only, 2)\npassIng a current through the external soleno1d\nonly, or 3) pasS1ng currents in opposIng or add1ng\ndIrectIons through both wires slmultaneously to\nproduce a w1de range of magnet1c field cond1t10ns.\nW1th thIS thruster conf1gurat10n 1t was Dbserved\nthat at any gIven flow rate, dIscharge current and\ndIscharge voltage, the Ion current to the side wall\nwas smaller when the magnetIc fIeld was created\nWIth the external solenoid alone than It was when a\nmagnetIc field of IdentIcal strength was created\nWIth the Internal solenOId alone. ThlS indicates\nthat the plasma is be1ng conta1ned better when the\nmagnet1c fIeld is created by the external solenOId\nthan It 1S when the Internal anode wire is used.\nWhy thIS should occur was not 1mmedlately apparent.\nThe reason the external COIl glves better performance than the internal one can be understood,\nhowever, by considering FIg. 8 further. Figure 8a\nshows the magnet1c f1eld lInes for the case where\nthe f1eld 1S produced entIrely by pass1ng a current\nthrough the anode wire. Figure 8b sho~ls the fIeld\nlines when the f1eld lS produced entIrely by the\nexternal soleno1d. The anode wIre In th1S second\ncase serves only as the anode. In F1g. 8b we\nnot1ce that certain fIeld lines 1ntercept the anode\nsurface dIrectly. As we progress outward from the\ncenterl1ne of th1S thruster along a rad1us, the surface of revolutIon of the fIrst fIeld lIne that we\nencounter Wh1Ch Intercepts the anode surface IS\n\n..\n\nEXTERNAL SOLEOID\n\n1 ieved to occur across the v1rtual anode surface\nbecause of the removal of electrons from the plasma\nby the anode. If th1S is 1ndeed the case, that is,\nlf the plasma denslty 1S reduced dramatically\nacross the virtual anode surface, then the 10ns\nmust cross this surface w1th an average veloc1ty\nsubstantlally less than the Bohm13 velocity. Th1S\nmust be so for if the 10ns crossed th1S surface\nfrom a reg10n of h1gh dens1ty to a region of low\ndensity with the Bohm veloc1ty, then an excess of\npos1tive charge would very qU1ckly be built up in\nthe low dens1ty reg10n. This excess charge would\nserve to reduce the ion veloc1ty across the v1rtual\nanode surface to the point where the flux of POS1t1ve charges across the surface was consistant\nwith the cond1t10n of quaS1-charge neutral1ty 1n\nboth the h1gh and low density reg10ns.\n\nINTERNAL\nSOLENOID\n\nBACK\nSURFACE\n\na)\n\n...\n\n..\n\nINTERNAL ANODE SOLENOIDAL FIELD\n\nTo see if th1S was 1ndeed the case the following exper1ment was performed. A thruster hav1ng\nthe conf1gurat10n shown schemat1cally 1n Fig. 9 was\nconstructed. The anode cons1sted of a washer-shaped\np1ece of 0.025 cm thick sta1nless steel. An aX1al\nmagnetic f1eld was created 1n the d1scharge chamber\nEXTERNAL SOLENOID\nthrough the use of a SlX turn soleno1d wrapped\naround the cyl1ndr1cal thruster body. The cathode\nconS1sted of a tungsten W1re bent 1nto a c1rcle\nANODE --t-----.-""\n10.2 cm 1n d1ameter. W1th th1S conf1gurat10n the\nentlre side wall was protected by the v1rtual anode\nsurface but the physical anode area exposed to the\nplasma was extremely small. Th1S allowed the 10n\nVIRTUAL\ncurrent to the slde wall to be measured very accuANODE\nrately Slnce the 10n current to the phys1cal anode\nBACK\nSURFACE\nwas negl1g1ble. The actual 10n currents to each\nSURFACE\nthruster surface are shown in F1g. 10 for an argon\nflow rate (m) of 1270 mA, a d1scharge current (JO)\nof 2.0 A and a d1scharge voltage (VO) of 50 V. It\n1S noteworthy that th1S discharge chamber gave a\nhlgher extracted 10n fract10n than the d1vergent\nf1eld design (F1g. la and F1g. 5). The remarkable\naspect of the results of F1g. 10 1S however that as\nb) EXTERNAL SOLENOIDAL FIELD\nthe ion current toward the gr1ds (JB + J~creen) 1ncreases by approx1mately a factor of 5, due to an\nF1g. 8 AX1al Magnet1c F1eld Thruster Conf1gurat10ns. increase 1n the magnet1c f1eld current from zero to\n100 A, the 10n current to the slde wall actually decreases. This shows that the vlrtual anode surface\ncalled the v1rtual anode surface. It 1S so called\nbecause once an electron becomes attached to a field does a remarkable Job of conta1n1ng the plasma. It\nllne on this surface 1t has a h1gh probably of being 1S bel1eved that th1S occurs because 10ns cross th1S\ncollected by the anode. Consequently, few electrons surface w1th veloc1ties approach1ng the1r random\nthermal veloc1ty rather than the Bohm veloc1ty. The\nwould be expected to be found at radial 10cat10ns\nfollowing rough calculat10n supports this hypothes1s.\ngreater than that of the v1rtual anode surface.\nTh1S 1n turn 1mpl1es that the plasma denSlty should\nAssum1ng that the 10ns reach the accelerator\nbe reduced substant1ally 1n the region outs1de of\nth1S surface. It appears that the reduced ion flux\nto the slde wall 1S a result of the reduced plasma\nEXTERNAL SOLENOID\ndens1ty in th1S reg10n. For the case of F1g. 8a\n(magnetic f1eld created by the 1nternal soleno1d),\nhowever, 1t 1S seen that no f1eld llnes 1ntercept\nthe anode d1rectly. Instead they tend to form concentr1c c1rcles around the anode W1re. Consequently\nthere 1S no v1rtual anode surface. Further, the\nf1eld strength between adJacent turns of the anode\nBACK\nWASHER\nW1re goes to zero. These two factors apparently\nSURFACE\nSHAPED\n17cm\nenable the plasma to leak out of the volume bounded\nANODE\nby the anode wire and the result 1S an 10n current\nto the slde wall greater than that observed w1th the\nexternal soleno1d.\nWhen the v1rtual anode surface 1S present, as\nment10ned earlier, 10n losses to the slde wa1l can\nbe greatly reduced. It was postulated that th1S\nreduced ion loss to the wall was the result of a\ngreatly reduced plasma dens1ty adjacent to 1t.\nFurther. th1S reduct10n 1n plasma dens1ty was be-\n\nF1g. 9 Axial tlagnet1c Fleld Thruster wlth WasherShaped Anode.\nlOS\n\n.la+Jscr\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 n\n500\n\nm =1270 mA eq\nJo\n2.0 A\nVo = 50 V\n\nThlS phenomenon can also be used to exp1aln\nthe low lon flux across the virtual anode surface\nobserved In the SERT II thruster. 14 In this case\nthe average current denslty across thls surface was\nmeasured and found to be approximately 15% of the\naverage current denslty toward the grlds. Rough\nca1cu1atlons suggest that If the ions have the Bohm\nve10clty at thls surface, then the average current\ndenslty would be on the order of 250% of the average\ncurrent toward the grlds. If they are assumed to\nhave the random thermal ve10clty however the calculated current denslty is about 10% of the current\ntoward the grlds.

With this\nthruster It was observed that the dlstrlbutlon of\nlon currents lnslde the discharge chamber was\nstrongly dependent on the shape and strength of the\nmagnetlc fle1d. Thls distrlbution of lon currents,\nhowever, was found to be lndependent of the dlscharge current, dlscharge voltage and the neutral\nflow rate. Wlth no magnetlc fle1d the lons move to\nthe thruster walls with equal probablllty In all\ndlrectlons, and the fractlon of current to each surface boundlng the plasma is equal to the area of\nthat surface dlvlded by the total surface area of\nthe prlmary electron reglon.\nThe fractlon of lon current to each thruster\nsurface was found to vary as a function of magnetlc\nfle1d strength for both the dlvergent and cusped\nfleld conflguratlons. Generally the fractlon of\nion current to the slde wall would decrease and the\nfraction of lon current toward the grlds would Increase as the fle1d strength was lncreased for these\nconflguratlons. No such redlstrlbutlon of lon currents was observed for the mu1tlpo1e configuratlon.\nIn this case, the ion current dlstrlbution remained\nthe same as It was for the zero magnetic fle1d\ncondltlon.\nMeasurements of the energy cost per plasma ion\n\nlndlcated that thlS cost decreased wlth increasing\nmagnetic fle1d strengths.

The apparatus developed for thlS study\nlS shown to be well sUlted for measurlng the lmplngement-11mlted perveance, electron backstreamln~\nand e1ectrlca1 breakdown characterlstlcs of two-grld\n10n accelerator systems. Results suggest that the\nlmplngement-11mlted perveance lS not dramatlca11y\naffected by reductl0ns ln screen hole dlameter to\n1.0 mm, but lmplngement-llmlted performance was\nfound to be dependent on the grld separation dlStance, the discharge-to-tota1 acce1eratlng voltage\nratlo, and the net-to-tota1 acce1eratlng voltage\nratlo. Results obtalned wlth small hole dlameters\nand closely spaced grlds suggest a new mode of grld\noperatlon where hlgh current denslty operation can\nbe achleved wlth a speclfied net acce1eratlon voltage. In thlS mode the grids are operated at a hlgh\nnet-to-tota1 acce1eratl0n voltage ratlo rather than\nthe low ones that have heretofore been conSldered to\nYle1d hlgher current densltles. Under these condltl0ns lt appears to be the onset of electron\nbackstreamlng that u1tlmate1y determines the extractable 10n current denslty. Beam current densltles as hlgh as 25 mA/cm 2 were obtalned uSlng grlds\nwlth 1.0 mm dlameter holes operatlng at a net acce1eratlng voltage of 500 V.\nIntroductl0n\n\n..\n\nIn order to reduce the number of e1ectrostatlc\n10n thrusters requlred for a space propu1s10n mlSSlon and hence the cost and mass of the thruster\nsubsystem, lt lS generally deslrable to lncrease\nthe thrust densltles of these devlces above those\nattalnab1e wlth currently aval1ab1e 10n thrusters.\nTo keep the thrusters operatlng at their optlmum\nspeclflc lmpu1se thlS should be accomplished by Increaslng the 10n beam current denslty extracted\nfrom the 10n OptlCS system wlthout lncreaslng the\neXltlng 10n ve10clty. ThlS can be done under the\nconstralnt of the space-charge effect by reduclng\nthe grld spaclngs and hole dlameters below the\nvalues used on present-day accelerator systems. The\nneed for thlS type of accelerator system becomes\neven more apparent when one conslders the current\ntrend away from heavy propellants such as mercury\nto 11ghter propellants such as argon and xenon. To\nachleve the optimum speciflc impulse for a typical\nmlSS10n, these lighter propellants requlre a lowerlng of the net accelerat1ng voltages below those\n+ Work supported under NASA Grant NGR-06-002-1l2\n* Research Asslstant, Department of Mechanlca1\nEnglneerlng\n** Professor, Department of Mechanlca1 Englneerlng,\nMember AIAA\nReleased to AIAA to publish In all rorms\n\n109\n\nbelng used for current accelerator system designs.\nIn terms of the extracted current densitles this\nmeans that the trend to lighter propellants necessltates the use of accelerator systems wlth smaller\ngrld holes and closer grld separatlons ln order to\nmalntaln current densities at thelr present levels.\nAlthough eXlstlng experlmenta1 performance\ndata for accelerator systems w1th relatlvely large\nscreen hole dlameters (> 2 mm) is qUlte extenslve,l,2,3 thlS same lnformation for smaller screen\nhole dlameters lS somewhat llmited.

It lS\nfor th1S purpose that the present deta1led investlgatl0n was undertaken.\nBackground and Theory\nThe essential components of a bas1c two gr1d\n10n accelerator system are shown in Flg. la. Although the side view of a slng1e aperture 1S deplcted, lt should be noted that a multi-aperture\nsystem 1S lmp1ied. The accelerator system lS\nplaced adJacent to a dlscharge chamber conta1nlng a\nlow density ionized plasma at a potentla1 of a few\ntens of volts above that of the screen grld. Around\neach screen hole a plasma sheath is formed WhlCh defines the boundary between the d1scharge plasma and\nthe acce1eratl0n region. Potentla1s applied to the\ngrlds produce an electric fle1d that accelerates\nthe 10ns and repels the electrons comlng lnto the\nsheath from the dlscharge plasma. Flgure 1b illustrates the variatl0n of these e1ectr1ca1 potentla1s\nassoclated wlth the grld geometry of Flg. la. The\nsolid llne of F1g. 1b shows how the potent1al drops\nSllght1y from the plasma to the relatlVe1y hlgh\nposltlve potentlal ln the grld. It remalns constant through the screen grld area then drops almost\n11nearly ln the space between the grlds. It lS\nconstant through the accel gr1d and then r1ses to\nthe potentlal far downstream of the accelerator\ngr1d. In thlS downstream reglon electrons are\navailable to maintain charge neutrality in the\nplasma assoclated with the ion beam. The dotted\nllne of Flg. lb shows how for a normally operating\ngrid the potential varles with pos1tion through the\ncenter of the grld holes rather than through the\ngr1ds themselves. The dlfference between the S011d\nand dotted llnes lS lnduced by the space charge\neffects of the 10ns passlng through the grids.\nTable 1 deflnes and names the symbols shown ln\nFlgS. la and lb.\n\nSCREEN HOLE\n\nwhich the ions are accelerated by the applied total\nacceleratIng voltage (VT). In the case of the\nparallel plate vacuum dIode, for which this equatIon\nwas origInally derIved, 2 refers to the physIcal\ndIstance between the parallel plates. However, In\nthe case of the extractIon aperture the emIssive\nsurface IS not defIned by a plate whose POSItIon\nis fIxed. but rather by a plasma sheath whose posItIon IS dependent on the ion current being extracted. The current denSIty of Ions arriving at\nthe plasma sheath, from the upstream plasma IS determIned by the Bohm condition for a stable sheath.\ni.e.,\n\nACCELERATOR\nGRID\n\nSCREEN\n\nMOO"""\'\'\' ) ""\n\nJ = ni qV;Te\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(2)\n\nI\n\na)\n\nIn thIs equatIon the discharge plasma Ion denSIty\n(ni) IS equal to the assocIated electron denslty\n(ne) and the electron temperature (Te) of the\nplasma IS In electron volts.

In normal operatIon the shape of\nthe plasma sheath IS similar to that shown in\nFIg. la. As the plasma density and as a result the\nion current denSIty increase, the sheath moves\ncloser to the screen hole and begIns to flatten out.\nEventually. an operating pOInt IS reached where the\nsheath can no longer focus the ions through the accelerator grid aperture and dIrect Ion impingement\nupon the accelerator grId begins to occur. At this\npOInt the acceleration length 2 requIred by ChIld\'s\nLaw has reached a value less than a physical acceleration length requIred to produce a well focused\nIon beam. ThIS phYSIcal acceleration length IS\ndIctated by the geometry of the accelerator system.\nIn past theoretical and experimental InvestigatIons,\nthe physical acceleration length used to correlate\nthe performance of various grId geometrIes is the\neffectIve acceleratIon length 2e where\n2e = [2~ +\n\ndIameter\n\n2g\n\nEffectIve acceleratIon length\n\nr- ]~\n\n(3)\n\nGrId separatIon dIstance\n\n2e\n\nd2\n\nReplacing 2 In Eq. 1 wIth 2e, and settIng the beam\ncurrent density lJ) equal to the beaml et current (JB)\ndivided by the area of a screen grId hole, Eq. 1 can\nbe written\n\n= Net accelerating voltage\nV = Total accelerating voltage\nT\nVu\n\nR\n\n= Net-to-total\n\nJ\n\nT\n\nThe current density extractIon capabIlIty of\nan accelerator system aperture like the one shown\nIn FIg. la IS generally lImIted by space charge\neffects to the value gIven by Child\'s Law.\n4\n9\n\nJ = -\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n(l9.)\n0\n\nm\n\nl\n\n~\n\nV 3/2\n\nT\nmr\n\nIn thIs equatIon. representatIve\nal model of the ion acceleratIon\npermIttIvIty of free space, q IS\nIS its mass and 2 represents the\n\n2\n\n_B_ (~)\nV 3/2 d s\n\nacceleratIng voltage ratio\n\n(1)\n\nof a one-dImenSIonprocess, \xc2\xa30 IS the\nthe Ion charge. mi\nlength through\n110\n\n2\n\n= \'11\xc2\xa30\n9\n\n(~)\ni\n\n~\n\n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe left SIde of thIS expression is known as the\nnormalIzed perveance per hole and it will be used\nIn thIS paper to correlate the performance of accelerator grId systems as a functIon of the varIous\ngrid geometries and the operating conditIons investIgated. Of particular interest will be the\nImpingement-lImIted normalIzed perveance per hole\ndefIned as the perveance per hole at the onset of\nexcessIve accelerator grId Ion ImpIngement. It\nshould be noted that the rIght-hand SIde of Eq. 4\nhas a fIxed value for a particular propellant. ThIS\nvalue is indicatIve of the perveance where one\nwould expect to encounter the Impingement limit.\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn the case of argon, the propellant used In this\nstudy, thlS 11mltlng value is computed to be\n6.8 x 10- 9 A/V3/2. Assumlng the grlds can be held\nparallel at any separatlon dIstance there are two\naddltlonal phenomena that 11mlt the operatIng range\nof an Ion acceleration system. These are electrlcal\nbreakdown through the regIon between the grIds and\nelectron backstreamlng lnto the dlscharge plasma\nfrom the plasma downstream of the grlds. In practlce the occurrence of these phenomena constralns\nthe absolute lower 11mits of grld separatl0n\ndIstances that can be reallzed and thus 11mlts the\n10n current WhlCh can be extracted from the accelerator system. ElectrIcal breakdown occurs when\nthe electrlcal fleld strength between the grlds\n(total acceleratIng voltage mInus the dlscharge\nvoltage all divlded by the grld separatl0n dlstance)\nexceeds the breakdown 11mlt. When thlS occurs exceSSlve electron currents begln to flow between the\ngrlds. ThlS 11mlt lS determlned by the geometry of\nthe grids as well as such factors as the grId surface fln1sh and the denSl ty of charged and neutral\nparticles between the grlds.\nElectron backstreamlng occurs when electrons\nln the downstream 10n beam plasma flnd a path along\nWhlCh they can be accelerated through grld apertures\ndlrectly lnto the dlscharge chamber. ThIS condltl0n\noccurs when the potentlal varlatlon through the\napertures lS slmilar to that shown by the centerllne\nln Flg. lb. When thlS type of potentlal profIle\neXlsts, the electrons ln the beam plasma are no\nlonger repulsed by the negatlve potentlal on the\naccelerator grld and they are therefore able to\nbackstream Into the dlscharge chamber.\n\nto\n\nMany factors lnfluence the onset of backstreamlng, and tradltlonally those factors pertalnlng to\nthe accelerator system have been lumped together to\nform a dlmenslonless paramete known as the electron backstreamlng parameter. The parameter used\nhereIn lS\n\nthat thIS reduces the nOlse because it reduces the\nrange of prlmary electron energles comIng off of the\ncathode.\nThe Ion current extractIon capabl1lty of var10US nlneteen aperture grld sets lnvestlgated in\nthIS study were each characterIzed by a dIfferent\nscreen aperture dlameter. The grld aperture pattern\nused was a hexagonal array wlth a center-to-center\nhole spaclng of 2.5 mm for all aperture dlameters.\nThe grids were made from thin sheets of commerclally\navaIlable graphIte, and to help ensure proper grld\nhole alignment, the screen and accelerator grlds\nwere SImultaneously match drIlled. As a result of\nthlS the screen and accelerator grlds both had the\nsame dIameter apertures. The thIcknesses of the\nscreen and accelerator grids were both the same ln\neach test and as hole Slze was varied for the\ndIfferent tests the grId thIcknesses were also\nvarled to hold the ratlo of hole diameter to grid\nthIckness constant at 0.25.\nBecause the grid separatIon dIstance was a\nvery lmportant parameter ln thlS study, the test\napparatus was deSIgned so It could be varIed contInuously whl1e the ion source was beIng operated.\nThis IS accompllshed,uslng the apparatus shown\nschematically in Fig. 2, by moving the fork-spaced\nwedge ln the manner suggested by the large arrow.\nAs thlS wedge lS moved toward the grIds it forces\nthe accelerator and screen grld support plates\napart and hence the screen and accelerator grlds\nattached to these plates are also separated. All\nmaterIals used in the constructIon of thIS apparatus are capable of wlthstandlng hIgh temperatures.\nGraphIte was used for both the grlds and grId support plates to mlnlmlze the differential thermal\n\ns\n\nFORK- SHAPED\nWEDGE\n\nThlS parameter lS slIghtly dlfferent from the one\nused ln prevlous theoretlcal investlgatlons where\nlnstead of (tg/d a ) the factor (tc/d a ) was used. 6\nThlS change was made because the factor (tq/d a )\ngave a better correlatl0n of the electron 5ackstreamlng data collected In thlS study.\nApparatus\nAll testlng has been conducted on a 8 cm dIameter by 10 cm long Ion source WIth a mIldly dIvergent magnetic fleld. The magnetlc fleld was\nderlved from a long solenoldal wlndlng wrapped\naround the outslde of the thruster body. A cyllndrlcal copper anode was used and apart from this,\nnonmagnetIc stalnless steel constructl0n was\nemployed throughout the source. Refractory tungsten fl1aments were used for both the neutrallzer\nand cathode emltters. The emlSS10n levels for both\nof these was controlled by adJustIng the current\nflowing through the fl1aments from thelr ac power\nsupplles. ThlS source deslgn was selected because\nlt provided the hlgh current denslty capabl11ty\nneeded to assure a proper test of the grlds. and lt\nprovIded a stable dIscharge. To mlnlmlze the dIScharge chamber nOlse further, the voltage drop\nacross the refractory cathode was reduced by uSlng\ntwo short fIlaments In parallel.

The d1stance over Wh1Ch the gr1ds\nwere supported was also mlnim1zed to mlnlmlze the\neffects of grld warpage. Inltla1 a11gnment of the\ngrlds was accomp11shed manually by posltlonlng and\nc1amplng each grld and then checklng the a11gnment\nvisually beneath a large l11umlnated magnlfYlng\nglass. This alignment lS maintalned durlng operation by the boron n1tride gUlde posts shown ln\nFlg. 2. Electrical ls01atlon lS assured by the\nsheet of isomlca between the screen grld support\nplate and the wedge. The wedge lS mechanlca11y\nconnected to a micrometer used to measure and adJust\nits translation from the outslde of the vacuum\nsystem.\nImmediately after each period of data co11ectlon, whl1e the source was stl11 hot, the grld\nseparatlon distance was reduced untl1 the measured\nelectrical resistance between the grids went essentla11y to zero. Th1S reference pOlnt on the micrometer (assumed to correspond to zero separation)\nalong with the geometry of the wedge could then be\nused to calculate the grld spaclng from the mlcrometer readlngs recorded durlng the testlng. ThlS\nprocedure for deflnlng the reference p01nt was\nusually repeated two or three tlmes for each test\nsetup to determ1ne if the reference pOlnt had\nchanged for some unknown reason. Based on repeated\nobservat10ns, it 1S be11eved that the gr1d separat10n d1stance was known to w1th1n ~ 0.01 mm.\nTest Procedure\nBecause the obJectlve of th1S study was to define the 11m1tat10ns of the accelerator system and\nnot those 1imltat10ns that mlght be source related,\nevery effort was made to operate the 10n source so\nthe h1ghest posslb1e lmp1ngement-11mlted perveance\nwould be rea11zed w1th each gr1d conf1gurat10n.\nTh1S was accomp11shed by opt1m1z1ng the propellant\nflow rate, discharge voltage (VD) and magentic\nf1e1d strength for each gr1d conf1gurat10n tested.\nIn general, 1t was found that dlscharge voltage and\nmagnetic field strength could be ma1nta1ned at a\nslng1e opt1mum value for a part1cu1ar net accelerating voltage. However, the propellant flow rate\nwas more critical and had to be opt1mized for every\ngrid separation 1nvest1gated. Th1S opt1mum flow\nrate was almost always equal to the m1n1mum flow\nrate at which the source operated stably over the\nfull range of beam currents invest1gated. The conduct of the tests 1nvo1ved the establishment of\nth1S opt1mum flow w1th a particular gr1d set, gr1d\nspac1ng and net acce1erat1ng voltage and then 1ncreasing the cathode em1SS10n current 1n steps to\ninduce 1ncreases 1n the beam and 1mp1ngement currents. These currents were recorded manually from\nh1gh accuracy d1g1ta1 gauges at each step. Th1S\nprocess cont1nued unt11 the 1mp1ngement current\nreached a high value (~10% of the beam current). At\nthis t1me, the cathode em1SS10n was reduced and the\nprocedure for co11ectlng electron backstream1ng\ndata was executed.\n\nnot be exceeded w1thout induc1ng electron backstream1ng. Slnce the grid separation and grid\ngeometry were known, the value of the electron backstream1ng parameter could be calculated from these\ndata. It will be shown later that the electron\nbackstreamlng parameter is somewhat dependent on the\nbeam current or norma11zed perveance per hole. The\nvalue of th1S parameter at the lmpingement-11m1ted\nperveance is probably of the most interest, however,\nso most of the backstreaming data was collected at\nthis high perveance cond1tion. After the impingement-11m1ted perveance and backstream1ng data had\nbeen collected, the gr1d separation dlstance was\nreduced and the preceed1ng procedures were repeated.\nBecause of the potentially destruct1ve nature\nof the electrical breakdown phenomenon, the e1ectrlca1 breakdown character1stlc of each of the\ngraphlte grid pa1rs were measured after the perveance/1mp1ngement character1st1cs and electron\nbackstream1ng data had been obta1ned. The background pressure was held constant for electrical\nbreakdown testlng at a pressure of 2.0 x 10- 5 Torr\nbecause th1S represented an average value of the\nbell Jar pressures encountered during all testing.\nThe data was collected by establ1sh1ng a given gr1d\nspaclng w1th the 10n source operat1ng at a moderate\nbeam current. The screen and accelerator voltages\nwere then 1ncreased 1n magn1tude unt1l electrical\nbreakdown occurred. These tests 1ndicated that\ne1ther the screen or accelerator voltage could be\nlncreased to lnduce breakdown, 1.e. the sum of the\ntwo voltages was the cr1t1ca1 var1ab1e 1n determ1nlng when breakdown occurred.\nResults\nF1gure 3 d1splays a set of tYP1cal curves\nshowlng how lmpingement current (normalized uS1ng\nARGON\nvN = 500 V\nR = 07\nVo = 50 V\n\nfg /\n\nt.\n\n101\n\n0\n\n086\n\nD.\n\n071\n056\n048\n\n"\n\n0\n\n~\n\nd.\n\n0\n\nta\n\n- . - - . 025\nd.\nd.\n\n*..\nd.\n\n10\n15 mm\n\n12\n\no\n\n~\n\nCt:\n\n10\n\n9\nI\nI\n\n....\nZ\n\nIII\nCt:\nCt:\n\nI\n\nI\n\n8\n\nt\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\n4\n\n:>\n\nu\n\n6\n\nI\n\n,\nI\n\n1\n\n4\n\nThe co11ect10n of backstream1ng data was accomp11shed by reduc1ng the accelerator gr1d potent1a1 (VT-VN) wh11e watching for the rather sudden\n1ncrease in beam current that 1S 1ndicat1ve of electron backstream1ng lnto the d1scharge chamber.

During the present study lt was\nfound for example that it was important that the\nion source be capable of producing Bohm current\ndenslties toward the grlds significantly greater\nthan the current densities belng demanded by the\ngrlds when they were operatlng near the lmpingement\nlimlt. This ensured that it was the grlds rather\nthan the lon source that was llmitlng lon extractlon. To accompllsh this the source must be operated at the progressively hlgher plasma densltles\nand hence smaller Debye lengths that are demanded\nas hole Slze and grld separatlon are reduced. It\nlS noted ln additlon that some adJustment ln flow\nrates was required to achleve the dlscharge chamber\noperating conditlon that would Yleld the hlghest\nlmplngement-llmited current densitles. It was also\ndetermlned that the stability of the dlscharge\nchamber lnfluenced the ion extractlon capabllltles\nof the grids. Durlng a segment of the tests the\ndlscharge chamber was changed to a deslgn that\noperated less stably (arc dlscharge nOlse belng\nbeing apparent on an oscllloscope). The onset of\nhigh lmpingement currents occurred at lower beam\ncurrent levels wlth this deslgn than it dld wlth\nthe more stable one.\nTo help visualize the dramatlc effect that\ndecreasing hole size has on current denslty the\ndata of Fig. 4 has been replotted ln Flg. 7 wlth\ncurrent denslty rather than perveance as the dependent varlable. The current densltles shown here\nwere calculated by divlding the implngement-llmlted\nbeam current per hole by the area of a screen hole.\nIt is noteworthy that the current densltles contlnue to rlse as grid separatlon lS reduced below\nthe value where perveance began to drop off ln\nFig. 4 (~ Ids = 0.6 to 0.7) and that current densities in~rease markedly as hole Slze lS reduced.\nThe current density of ~ 25 mA/cm 2 measured with\nARGON\nVN \xe2\x80\xa2 500V\nR \xe2\x80\xa2 07\nVo \xe2\x80\xa2 50V\n\nd, (mml\n0\n0\n\nI 0\nI 5\n\n6.\n\n2 0\n\nthe 1.0 mm diameter holes is observed to be the\nmaXlmum value realized at a net acceleratlon voltage of 500 V for the case consldered here where the\nscreen and accel grld hole diameters were equal and\nthe lmplngement was limlted to 1% of the beam current.

Aston 3 has also\nreported that the net acceleratlon voltage level can\naffect the lmpingement-limlted perveance capablllties of grid systems. He suggests that the ratlo\nof dlscharge voltage-to-total acceleratlng voltage\nlS a sUltable correlatlng parameter for data of thlS\nsort.

Such a situatlon\ncould occur at low net accelerat1ng voltages where\nlow current densities w1th thelr attendant low\nplasma densities and larger Debye lengths are observed.

It shows that increases in the net-tototal acceleration voltage ratIo (R) cause the\ncharacteristIC impIngement-lImIted perveance vs.\ngrId separatIon curves to shift to the left.

As the norma11zed grid separation is reduced, the electron backstreaming parameter remalns falrly constant, and\nthen falls off slightly at the lower grld spaclngs.\nThe reason for this drop off lS uncertain at thlS\ntime, but lt should be noted that at the lower grld\nseparatlons under some condltions lt was difflcult\nto distinguish between increases in beam current\ndue to improved focuslng and increases due to backstreaming. There is also a trend in Fig. 11 toward\nlower electron backstrea~ing parameters wlth decreaslng hole size.

Test results ind1cate the path\nlength from the neutralizer to the beam along magnet1c fleld llnes also has an effect on the beam-toneutrallzer plasma potential difference but this\neffect was typically smaller than the other two\neffects. The results suggest that 1n order to mlnlmlze the adverse effects of stray magnet1c fields,\na reg10n as free of magnetic fields as possible\nshould be selected for placement of the neutrallZer.\n\nApparatus and Procedure\nThe experiments were conducted in the 1.2 m\ndlameter by 4.6 m long stainless steel tank shown\nschematlcally in Fig. 1. The operating pressure\nSTAiNLESS STEfl.\n\nVAO.AJM FACILITY\n\nFig. 1 Neutrallzation Test Apparatus\nin the vacuum system was in the range of 5 ~\n7 X 10- 6 torr during the tests. At this pressure\nthe electron collision frequency is small compared\nto a typical cyclotron frequency so the conditions\nof this test should model the collisionless environment of the space tests adequately. Further\nthe potential of the plasma in the vacuum tank was\ntypically several volts above ground, so most neutralizer electrons should have been reflected from\nthe tank walls; a condition that also facilitates\nmodel1ng of the space plasma. The SIT-8 mercury\nlon thruster 3 ldentified in Fig. 1 is located at\none end of the test facility in such a way that its\nion beam 1S directed along the tank axis. Neutralizatlon of this beam is accomplished by either the\nstandard SIT-8 hollow cathode mercury neutralizer3\nlocated adJacent to the thruster or by the distant\nneutralizer shown in Fig. 1. Both neutralizers\nutillze conventional 0.32 cm dia. mercury hollow\ncathodes. Each of the neutrallzers is equipped\nwlth a rolled tantalum foil insert, and a toroidal\nkeeper electrode located ~ 0.08 cm downstream of\nthe orlflce plate. The distant neutralizer cathode\nhas a 0.04 cm dia. orifice while the local one is\n0.025 cm in diameter. In order to ach1eve stable\nand reproducible operation of the neutralizers, the\ndlstant one was operated at a mercury flow rate of\n~ 60 mA while the local one operated at ~ 12 mAo\nThe lower flow rate was presumably requ1red for the\nlocal neutralizer because it had a smaller orifice\ndiameter and because lt utilized an enclosed keeper\nconf1guration.\nThe distant neutralizer was attached to a rod\npassing through the top of the tank as shown in\nF1g. 1. When th1S rod was rotated the neutralizer\n\nIntroductlon\nRecent tests conducted ln space on the SERT II\nSpacecraft lncluded an investigation of the process\nof ion beam neutralizat10n from an electron source\nlocated far from the ion beam. This was accompllshed by uSlng the neutrallzer or unaccelerated\nthruster plasma of a thruster located a meter or fO\naway from the thruster operating at hlgh vol tage \xe2\x80\xa2 .2\nOne of the results observed in this test was that\nthe potential dlfference between the neutralizer\nand beam pl asma potentla 1 could be lower with the\ndlstant neutrallzer than it was when the local one\nwas used. In order to determine if local magnetic\nflelds could be the cause of thlS and to develop\nan understandlng of neutralization phenomena that\nwould aid 1n the deslgn of future neutralizers,\nthe study described hereln was conducted.

Because the vacuum tank is stalnless\nsteel the influence of the earth\'s magnetic field\nis felt within it. ThlS field has a magnitude of\n0\n~ 0.5 gauss and is inclined at an angle of 65 from\nthe directlon of the ion beam in the plane of\nsectlon A-A in Fig. 1. Movement of the neutralizer\nsupport rod through its 180 0 travel is sufflcient\nto place the neutralizer at positions where it lies\non earth magnetlc field lines that elther intersect\nthe lon beam centerllne or mlSS it by distances up\nto ~ 30 cm. Each neutrallzer cathode was equlpped\nwlth power supplies that controlled keeper potentlal,cathode tip heater current and neutralizer\nblas potential. Keeper currents for the cathodes\nwere maintained at either 0.3 or 0.4 A and the neutralizer bias was adJusted so it was sufflciently\nnegatlve to effect the neutralizer emisSlon required to match the lon beam current. Auxlllary\nmagnetlc fields of variable magnltude were generated in these experiments by uSlng the two electromagnets shown in Fig. 1. These magnets were\nlocated immediately adJacent to the particular neutrallzer they served. Magnetlc flelds of the order\nof 15 to 30 gauss could be induced at the neutralizer cathodes with these magnets.\nEvaluatlon of the effects of parametric varlations lntroduced in the experiments required the\nmeasurement of the neutralizer blas voltages, proflles of the plasma potential, and magnetic field\nshapes and magnitudes. The neutralizer bias voltage could be measured directly but the beam plasma\npotentlal had to be measured by an emlSSlve probe\nas suggested by Fig. 1.\n0\n\nIn a second series of experiments the dlstant\nneutrallzer was moved to the vlcinlty of the vacuum\nfeed through ln the configuratlon shown ln Flg. 2.\nIn thlS configuration the neutrallzer cathode axis\nwas pOlnted at the ion beam rather than away from\nit as lt had been in the conflguration shown ln\nFlg. 1. It was also lnstalled so emltting and nonemitting spherical Langmuir probes could be used to\nmeasure plasma properties along the neutralizer\naX1S through that region ranging from immedlately\nadJacent to the distant neutralizer lnto the Ion\nbeam. The emlSSlve probes were used to measure\nplasma potential proflles while the non-emltting\none gave electron density and temperature lnformatlon as well. The details of the operatlon of\nthese probes are descrlbed ln Refs. 4 and 5. In\nthIS second serles of tests two electromagnets were\nlnstalled to facilitate control of the magnetlc\nfleld ln the Vicinity of the dlstant neutrallzer in\nthe manner suggested in Fig. 2. The Intensities\nand shapes of magnetic fields ln all of these tests\nwere determIned from gaussmeter and iron filings\nmap measurements.\nExperlmental Results\nNeutralizatIon in the Unaltered Environment of\nthe Magnetic Fields of the Thruster and Earth\nThe lnltlal investigatIons lnto the neutralizatIon of the Ion beam were conducted with the\nelectromagnets shown in Fig. 1, turned off. The\nmagnetlc fleld ln the regIon between the dIstant\nneutralizer and lon beam is in thlS case the weak\none (~ 0.5 gauss) associated wlth earth only. In\nthe region between the local neutrallzer and lon\nbeam the net magnetic field as lnduced by the\nthruster and earth was about 18 gauss. At a beam\n120\n\nNORMAL\nELECTROMAGNET\n\nION\nBEAM\n\nSECTION B-B\n\nFig. 2 NeutralIzation Test Apparatus\ncurrent of 100 mA with the dlstant neutralizer\npositIoned as shown in Flg. 1, so electrons emitted\nfrom it would pass about 30 em from the beam\ncenterline, the plasma potential profiles represented by the dotted and dashed curves of Figure 3\nwere observed. These proflles were measured\nthrough the ion beam at the indicated distances\ndownstream of the ion source screen grld and during\ndata collectlon for these curves, the local neutralizer was not operating. When the distant neutralizer was turned off and the local neutralizer\nwas started the higher plasma potentials represented by the sol id and centerl ines were observed at the\ntwo aXIal locations identIfIed. The higher plasma potentials observed here WIth the local neutralIzer\nare reminiscent Of results obtaIned during some of\nthe SERT-II tests ,2 conducted In space. The\nplasma potential profile at the 6 em locatlon is\nalso seen to be broader when the local neutralizer\nlS being used, a condltion that was also observed\nln the space tests. Both of these effects are believed to be manifestations of an Impedence between\nthe beam and local neutrallzer plasmas that is\nhigher than the one between the dlstant neutrallzer\nand beam plasma. This postulate is also supported\nby the observation that the neutralizer cathode\nbias voltage relative to ground (V c ) reqUIred to\neffect neutralization was also conSIderably lower\nIn magnItude when the distant neutrallzer was used.\nIn a second experIment the local neutralizer\nwas secured. the dlstant neutralizer was moved with\nrespect to the ion beam while the thruster was\noperating.

ThlS neutrallzer\nmovement was accompllshed by rotatlng the arm supporting the distant neutralizer (Flg. 1) so the\nneutrallzer plasma was moved from the earth magnetlc fleld line mlsslng the lon beam centerline\nby ~ 30 cm to one pasSlng through the lon beam\ncenterllne and the beam potentlal proflles shown\nln Flg. 4 were obtalned. As lndlcated on the flgure. proflles were measured at axial locatlons\ndownstream from the grlds (x) of 6. 29 and 52 cm.\nThe results shown ln thlS flgure are as expected\nln that the beam plasma potentlals dropped when the\nneutralizer was moved to the fleld llne lnterceptlng the beam aX1S. The fact that this drop was\nsmall (~ 3v) could be due to the fact that the neutralizer plasma was not moved very far away from\nthe edge of the beam plasma. In this regard lt lS\nnoted that 1) the beam plasma potentials suggest\nsubstantlal beam spreadlng wlth aXlal positlon and\n2) the electron gyro radlus ln the tank plasma and\nearth\'s magnetlc field is about 10 cm. The fact\nthat the gyro radlus lS less than the 30 cm dlStance between the magnetic field llne passing\nthrough the neutralizer plasma and the beam centerline lS conslstent wlth the observed change ln the\nplasma potentlal proflles. It lS also noted that\nthe neutrallzer blas voltage (V e ) requlred to\neffect neutrallzatlon of the 100 mA beam current\ntracked wlth the changes in plasma potentials. It\nhas been suggested 6 that fluctuations ln beam\n\nplasma potentlals of the order of several volts\nobserved durlng the SERT-II space tests could have\nbeen caused by spacecraft motlon in the earth\'s\nmagnetlc fleld. These fluctuations were orlginally\nattributed to a spacecraft wake effect but the\nrelatlve motion of the dlstant neutralizer and beam\nln the earth\'s magnetlc fleld could have also\ncaused thlS effect ln much the same way lt was Induced in the test Just descrlbed.\n\n121\n\nThe Influence of Magnetlc Field at the Dlstant\nNeu tra 1i zer\nFor this series of tests the electromagnet at\nthe dlstant neutrallzer in the Flg. 1 test configuration was posltioned so its solenoidal magnet\nfleld was aligned wlth the neutralizer axis as suggested by the lnset sketch ln Flg. 5. As the electromagnet current was varied the shapes of the\nfield lines shown in Fig. 5 were not altered but\nthe field strengths did change. The beam plasma\npotential profiles at axial locatlons of 6. 29 and\n52 cm downstream of the grlds were measured as this\nchange was effected. The relatlve shapes and magnltudes of these proflles at these three axial\npositlons were however conslstent with the trends\nshown in Flgure 5.

Flgure 5 shows that\nthe magnitudes of both this representatlve beam\nplasma potential and the neutrallzer blas voltage\nlncrease as the magnltude of the solenoidal magnetic fle1d at the neutra11zer tlP is lncreased.\nThe same behavlor lS observed at beam currents of\n100 rnA and 200 rnA although the magnltudes of both\nvoltages are hlgher at the hlgher beam current.\nFlgure 6 shows that the coupling voltages between the neutra1lZer and beam plasmas (l.e., total\nvoltage drop from beam plasma to neutra11zer tip)\ntaken from the data of Flgure 5 are nearly directly\nproportlona1 to magnetlc flux denslty at both beam\ncurrents. Further, these voltage dlfference levels\nlncrease in dlrect proportlon to the beam current\nlevel. Vlsual observatlon of the neutralizer\nplasma when the solenoidal magnetlc field current\nwas increased showed that an lncrease ln the fleld\nstrength caused the 1umlnous reglon associated with\nthe cathode discharge to contract. As the magnetlc\nfle1d strength was increased to ~ 15 gauss, the\nhollow cathode dlscharge appeared as a very tiny\nbrlght spot at the orifice.\n\n\xc2\xb00~--------~5~--------~10~--------~15\nMAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY (gauss)\n\nFig. 6 Effect of Magnetlc Fleld at the Distant\nNeutralizer on Voltage Difference Between\nthe Neutrallzer and Ion Beam\n\nIn order to further clarify the lnf1uence of\nthe magnetic field on the neutra11zer\'s abl11ty to\ncouple to the ion beaM, another serles of tests\nwere undertaken. In these tests the dlstant neutra11zer was posltloned so ltS aX1S was perpendicular to the thruster aX1S as shown ln Flg. 2. The\nmagnetic flelds were arranged so one was aligned\nwith the neutrallzer axis and another was normal to\nlt as suggested by the sketch of sectlon B-B ln\nFlg. 2. Each of the magnets could be controlled\nlndependent1y. Agaln as the current was varled to\nelther electromagnet the shapes of the fle1d 11nes\nwere not altered but the fle1d strengths dld change.\nThe plasma potential proflles along the neutra11zer aX1S from the cathode to the ion beam\ncenter observed when the axial magnetlc field was\non and the normal magnetlc field was off are shown\nln Fig. 7a. These curves show that there is a\nsteep potential Jump between the neutralizer\ncathode and the plasma close to the cathode orifice.\nMost of the voltage increase between the neutralizer cathode and the beam plasma is seen to occur\nin thlS reglon. Further the magnitude of thlS\n122\n\nvoltage rise lS observed to lncrease wlth aXlal\nmagnetic flux denslty at the neutra11zer tip. It\nlS noteworthy that the data pOlnts at the cathode\norlfice (on the vertical axis) in Flg. 7a correspond to the neutra11zer blas voltage whl1e those\nfurther downstream were measured using the emissive probes. After the inltia1 voltage Jump, ltS\nrlse lS observed to be approxlmate1y 11near with\ndistance and of the order of a few to several volts.\nAs the axial magnetlc fle1d (the component along\nthe dlrection of the neutralizer axis) was increased by lncreasing the current to the aXla1\nelectromagnet (Fig. 2), Fig. 7a shows the magnitudes of the plasma potentials increased and the\ncathode potentla1 requlred to induce a 100 rnA emlSSlon current decreased. Flg. 8 shows this same\neffect in the form of plots of the beam plasma\n(l.e., 60 em from the neutralizer), the neutrallzer\nplasma (l.e., ~ 0.3 em from the neutrallzer) and\nthe neutralizer cathode potentials as a function of\nthe magnetic flux density at the neutralizer cathode oriflce. It lS noted the plasma density profile measured along the neutra11zer aX1S and shown\nin Flg. 9 as function ofaxla1 magnetic field does\nnot seem to be affected sigmficant1y by this field.\nThese resu1 ts suggest that the axial magnetic field\naffects the capacity of a neutralizer to couple to\nthe ion beam princlpa1ly because it lnduces a po-\n\n15\n\n10\'\xc2\xb7\n\n(I\n\nM\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-~l FROM EMISSIVE\n\n-6SA\n\n.0----0-.1--- - ~ ___\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n__ ...b--\n\n~\n\n--<;--------\n\n-4::J\n\nC\n\nI MA\xe2\x80\xa2 -2 2A\n\nPROBE MEASUREMENTS\n100mA BEAM CURRENT\n\nlMA.-OA\n\n0~--1~0--~ro~~3~0--~40~~OO~-7ro\'\n\nZ\nW\n\n>IUi\n\nDISTANCE FROM NEUTRALIZER (em l\n\n~\n\n::;\n,\nE\n\n-\'\n<I\n\n;::\n\n100mA BEAM CURRENT\n\nZ\nW\n0\n\n-5\n\n10te\n\nz\ne\nQ:\nIU\nW\n..J\nW\n\n-10 }FROM NEUTRALIZER CATHOOE BIAS METER\n\n-15\n\nol PLASMA POTENTIAL PROFILES ON NEUTRALIZER AXIS\n\nIOI40~---l----~2-----:3~---l4-----5~---\'6L-----\'7\n\n20 \'\n\n\\\n\nDISTANCE FROM NEUTRALIZER (em)\n\n\\\n\ny----~.-68A\n\nF1g. 9 Electron Dens1ty Prof1le for AX1al Magnetic\nF1eld Case\n\n1oo..-22A\n\ntent1al drop close to the cathode orifice.

In contrast\nto F1g. 8, where the axial f1eld was observed to\ncause an increase 1n the potential d1fference very\nclose to the cathode (~ 0.3 cm), the normal magnetic\nf1eld 1nduces a potent1al d1fference over a much\nlonger distance (a few cent1meters).

In\nthe filings maps to the left of center the external\nmagnet acts to cancel the thruster f1e1d thereby\nreduc1ng the magn1tude of magnetic flux density at\nthe neutra11zer and bend1ng the field l1nes passing\nthrough the neutralizer toward the ion beam. In\nthe f111ngs maps on the r1ght, the external magnet\n1S used to 1ncrease the magnet1c field magnitude\nand draw the f1e1d 11nes pass1ng through the neutralizer still further away from the beam. The\narrows associated w1th each filings map 1nd1cate\nthe magnitude of magnet1c flux density at the neutra11zer correspond1ng to that f11ings map.\nF1gure 13 shows that when the magnet1c flux density\nmagn1tude is increased and the f1e1d 11nes pass1ng\nthrough the neutra11zer are drawn further away from\nthe beam, the neutralizer bias and beam plasma potentials are increased.

This potential dlfference between the neutrallzer and\nadJacent plasma lncreases 11nearly with aXlal magnet1c flux denslty. When a magnetlc fleld that is\nperpendlcular to the neutra11zer axis is app11ed\nthe region over WhlCh the potentlal rlse occurs is\nextended over several cent1meters.\nStray magnet1c f1e1ds associated with ion\nthruster themselves are suffic1ently large to cause\nsubstantla1 lncreases 1n the potential dlfference\nbetween the neutralizer and the beam plasma. In\norder to minlmlze this effect a region as free of\nmagnetlc flelds as possible should be selected for\nplacement of the neutrallzer. The neutralizer does\nnot seem to have any dlff1culty coupling to the 10n\nbeam over distance of the order of 1 meter as long\nas the magnetlc field levels are low (of order 0.5\ngauss or less). If a neutralizer must be located\nln the region of a stray thruster magnetic field,\nan external magnet Wh1Ch lS properly arranged to\nalter the magnetic fle1d so lt lS directed toward\nthe 10n beam can lmprove coupl1ng. Appllcation of\nsuch a fleld does not seem to alter thruster performance measurably.

This could facilitate containment if toxic or radioactive materials\nwere being launched.\n\nABSTRACT\n\n,.\n\nAn electrothermal ramjet confirguration is\nexamined as a possible alternative to rail guns and\nmass drivers for high acceleration launch missions.\nFor a spec1fic mission (earth escape) the idealized\nperformance of the electrothermal ramjet, the electrothermal rocket and the electromagnetic acceleration system are compared.\nTh1S comparison indicates that the gross performance of the ramjet compares favorably with that of the ideal electromagnetic acceleration system. A specific configuration for the ramJet is chosen and models for the\ndynamics, thermodynamics and fluid mechanics are\npresented. Results of calculations for a tYP1cai\nsupersonic launch cycle suggest that pressure,temperature and power demand profiles associated with\nramjet operation should be reasonable. A light gas\ngun is proposed to accelerate the vehicle to the\ncritical velocity where efficient ramjet operation\ncan begin. The theoret1cal performance of the ramjet is also shown to be substant1ally better than\nthat of the light gas gun at high velocities.\n\nAnother propulsion concept which may be useful\nin these high acceleration level missions is the\nelectrothermal rocket concept.\nIn these devices\non-board propellant is heated electrically and then\ndischarged through a nozzle to produce thrust.\nBecause the heat1ng is accomplished electrically,\nhydrogen propellant with\nits\nattendant\nhigh\nspec1fic impulse capability can be selected. There\nare several types of electrothermal rockets.\nIn\nthe resistojet, for example, the propellant is\nheated by passing it over current-carrying, resistive elements and exhaust vel~cities as high as\n8500 m/sec have been achieved.\nHigher exhaust\nvelocities can be realized if the material limitations imposed by the heating elements are eliminated and joule heating is accomplished by passing\ncurrent d1rectly through the propellant in an\narcjet thruster.\nExhaust velocities as high as\n15000 m/sec have been demonstrated in these dev4\nices.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe relatively massive expenditure of chem1cal\nfuel and oxidizer associated with the launch phase\nof space missions adds substantially to the cost of\nsuch\nmissions.\nNot only are the propellants\ncostly, but the addit10nal mass of tankage and\nstructure required to hold the propellant mass\ndetracts from the payload mass and therefore adds\'\nsubstantially to the cost of the del1vered payload.\nIt is also desirable to simplify these launch systems and 1mprove their rel1ability. For some missions where high acceleration levels\ncan\nbe\ntoleratei such alte~native launch sche!es as light\ngas guns , rail guns , and mass drivers have been\nproposed as substitutes for conventional rockets.\nThese missions could include ones in which various\nmaterials would be directed into apace either for\ndisposal or application there. While the capital\n1nvestment in such systems is expected to be large,\nthey hold the promise of lower cost per launch\nbecause of the large number of launches that should\nbe realized over their design lifetimes.\n\nA basic electrothermal rocket vehicle which\nmight be used in this application is shown conceptually 1n Figure lao Th1S rocket would carry onboard propellant which would be metered into the\nheating chamber where its temperature could be\nraised by energy either beamed there electromagnetically or carried there in the form of electrical\ncurrent from rails located in the launch tube.\nFor the mission under consideration here,\nwhere the launch is accomplished in a relatively\nshort distance close to the earth\'s surface, it is\nalso practical to distribute the propellant in the\nlaunch tube. When this is done a ramjet engine can\nbe used to collect the propellant, heat it and produce the desired thrust as it moves down the tube.\nPhYSically the ramjet would operate in the manner\nsuggested by Figure Ib by simply drawing propellant\nin from the tube through an intake diffuser, heat1ng it electrically and then expelling it through a\nnozzle. Energy could alain be transported into the\nheating chamber either electromagnetically or in\nthe form of electrical current. No compressor or\nother rotating equipment would be needed although\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Work performed under NASA GRANT NGR-06-002-112\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Professor, Dept. of Mech.

If one spec~fies !n allowable\nstress in the vehicle of 1.4 x 10 nt/m\n(200,000\npsi) then the maximum allowable acceleration (Eq.\n3) becomes\n30,000 G\'s. This acceleration, while\nh1gh\nis not considered unattainable. Light gas\nguns 1 have in fact been operated at projectile\nacceleration levels an order of magnitude higher\nthan this. For our case, however 30,000 G\'s should\nnot be exceeded 1G comp!essive stresses are to be\nheld below 1.4 X 10 nt/m during launch to a veloC1ty of 13 km/sec. Th1S velocity will be sufficient to enable escape from the earth when the\nvehicle diameter is given by Eq. 2. For a 10 kg\nmass having the ballistic and drag coefficients\nmentioned\nthis would correspond to a vehicle\nseveral centimeters in diameter.\n\n131\n\nRAMJET, U\'15000 m/,.e, X,\'285m\n(ROCKET, U \'15000 m lsee.

The effect of\nincreasing rocket exhaust velocity from 4.S00 to\nIS,OOO m/sec is observed to be a three-to-fourfold\nreduction in the launch time and a two-to-threefold\nreduction in the required launch track length (x f ).\n\nThis points out the great benefit of uS1ng the high\nexhaust velocity electrothermal rocket rather than\nthe conventional chemical rocket motor which is\ncharacterized by the lower exhaust velocity. By\nusing a ramjet rather than a rocket further reductions in launch times and track lengths are realized at a given exhaust veloc1ty.\nTh1S occurs\nbecause there is no on-board propellant being\naccelerated in the case of the ramjet.\nAt an\nexhaust veloc1ty of 15,000 m/sec the ramjet performs essentially the same as the electromagnet1c\naccelerator in that it requires the same track\nlength (285 m) and launch time (44 msec). The\n8,500 m/scc ramjet is seen to exh1b1t performance\ncomparable to the 15,000 m/sec rocket.\nFigure 5 shows the time profile of the vehicle\nacceleration\nfor\nthe various thrusters.\nThe\nacceleration is limited to 30,000 G\'s and th1s\nimplies considerably lower in1tial accelerations\nfor the convent1onal rockets in which the veh1cle\nmass must decrease with time as on-board propellant\nis discharged.

As this discussion\nsuggests it is desirable to have a ramjet exhaust\nvelocity that is substantially greater than the\ndesired vehicle velocity at the end of the launch\nphase.\nIt is interesting to note at this point\nthat constant exhaust velocity, constant thrust\noperation of a ramjet implies constant mass flow\nrate operat10n. Th1S would seem at first to be\nd1fficult to ach1eve in this case where the projectile veloc1ty is continuing to increase.\nA constant mass flow rate can be realized however by\neither varying the ramjet intake area or the d1stribution of mass in the launch tube.\nFigure 6 shows the variation in veh1cle mass\nwith time for each of the thrusters. These curves\nsimply reflect the variat10ns in\nacceleration\nobserved in Figure S.\nIt is noteworthy however\nthat the 4,500 m/sec convent10nal rocket requires\nan init1al mass of 180 kg to deliver a final mass\nof 10 kg at 13 km/sec wh11e the 15,000 m/sec ramjet\ncan do it with 11.S kg and the ideal electromagnetic thruster requires only the desired 10 kg as\nan initial mass.

Before a ramjet can be operated it\nis necessary to accelerate it, using an alternative\nforce, to that velocity where it is processing adequate propellant mass. For the ramjet cases in\nFig. S this is arbitrarily presumed to be accomplished using an auxiliary rocket motor.\nDuring\nthe first ten milliseconds or so the acceleration\nof the 8.S km/sec ramjet increases because this\nauxiliary rocket is operating and on-board mass is\nbeing expelled to accelerate the vehicle to the\npoint where the ram pressure is sufficient to\neffect ramjet operat10n.\nTh1S decrease in mass\n\nU - 4500 m/see\n\n\'"\n\n"-.\n\nTIME(m.ee)\n\nFig. 5.\n\nm,\' 10 kg\n\n----. -.....\n\nU - 4500 mIMe\n\n\\\n\\\n\n(ROCKET, U - 8500 m/.ee\n\n\\.\n\\\n\n\\\n\nm/sec\n\n100~----~\'-~~~----~15~0~--~200~----~2~50~----300.J\nTlME(m.ee)\n\nFig. 6.\n\nMass Profile Comparison\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Application of the momentum balance equation\ndemonstrates that the thrust (F\nm [U-v])\ngoes to zero as the vehicle velocity (v) approaches the exhaust velocity (U).\n\n=\n\n132\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe power profiles for each operating condition are compared in Figure 7.

The variation in\ntotal energy requ1red for the launch 1S seen to be\nrelatively modest between the various modes, but\nthe ramjet and electromagnet1c designs are seen to\nrequire substant1ally greater peak power levels.\nF1gure 7 shows that the peak power levels of the\nhigh exhaust velocity ramjet and the electromagnetic gun are comparable. The electromagnet1c gun\nis observed to require the least energy of any\noption, but it is important to note that this is a\nhighly idealized model. The energy stored in the\nmagnetic fields of this device, when the vehicle\nleaves the launch track, as well as joule heating\nlosses will be substantial and they have not been\nincluded here. The1r inclusion could well make the\nenergy requ1red for the electromagnetic gun more\ncomparable to values obtained with the rockets and\nramjets.\n\ntherefore appropriate to examine specific ramjet\nconfigurations and to determine the mechanical complexity that might be required and the extent of\nthe thermodynamic losses associated witf their\noperation.\nRAMJET DESIGN FEATURES\nThe conventional ramjet design shown in Fig.\nIb could be used in the present application. In\nth1s configuration it would fly down the launch\ntube processing a portion of the hydrogen and\nbypassing the remainder through the region between\nits exterior surface and the launch tube wall.\nSuch a design has several drawbacks typified by the\nfollowing examples of major design problems:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransmission of electrical\nor\nelectromagnetic energy\nthrough the ramjet sidewall\ninto the heat addition core.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nControl\nof\nthe\nramjet\ngeometry\nto effect shock\nswallowing\nand\nefficient\noperation\nover the large\nvehicle velOCity range that\nwill be encountered.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nControl of the radial position of the vehicle within\nthe tube.\n\nI\n\n/I\n\n40\n\n"\n"\n\nCONSTANT THRUST\n\n,"\n,\n,\n,\n,\nI\n\nCONSTANT EXHAUST VELOCITY\n\n\'" =30000\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nU :I\n\nG\'.\n\nmf\xc2\xb7 10 kg\n\nRAMJET\n\n15000 mIne\n\nE.

For example losses due to\naerodynamic and frictional drag and residual thermal energy in the propellants have been neglected\nfor the launch phase, as have propellant pumping\npowers and losses associated with energy transport\nthrough conductors or windows. These could change\nabsolute numbers Significantly although the comparative results are considered correct, and the\nsuggest the hydrogen ramjet thruster could exhibit\nperformance that is comparable to that associated\nwlth idealized electromagnetic thruster.\nIt is\n133\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe structural design of the\nprojectile\nappears to be\nrelatively simple.\n\ninary calculations valueless.\nStarting the projectile through the application of an external force will be addressed later.\nFor purposes of this analysis we assume the projectIle has been accelerated to a substsntial supersonic velOCity. Though it is lIkely that there will\nbe a conical shock attached to the nose of the projectile, the strength of this shock can be controlled to some extent by the contour and half\nangle of the prOjectile nose.\nConsequently, for\nthis preliminary analysis the diffusion process is\nmodeled as an isentropic one. After diffusion the\nhydrogen workIng fluid undergoes heat addition at a\nsubsonic velocity in a constant area duct and this\nis followed by an isentropic expansion to a supersonic exhaust velocity. For this analysis propellant velOCIties were computed in the frame of\nreference of the moving projectile. The fact that\nthe tube wall whIch is the outer boundary to this\nflow, is moving in this frame of reference was\nassumed to have no effect on the behavior of the\nflow. The basic equations of compreSSIble fluid\nmechanics (conservation of mass and energy coupled\nwith a thermodynamic path equation) were applied\nseparately to the diffusion, heat addItIon and\nexpansion processes.\n\nVariations in fluid flow\nareas\nneeded\nto achIeve\nproper flow conditions as\nthe\nprojectile\nvelocity\nIncreases can be introduced\nby\nvarying\nthe\ncrosssectional area of the launch\ntube as a function of axial\nposition.\nLAUNCH TUBE\n\nWALL\n\nPROJECTILE\n\n/\' ANNULAR\nDIFFUSER\n\nTHROAT\n\nANNULAR\nHEAT\n\nThrust was computed by applYIng the momentum\nequation in the frame of reference of the control\nvolume moving with the prOJectile.\nIt should be\nnoted that the boundary conditions associated with\nthe annular flow ramjet are different than those\nassociated with conventional ramjet operation.\nIn\nthe present case the inlet and outlet flow areas\nare equal and the flow area in the heat addItion\nzone must be less than this inlet/outlet area. In\nthe conventIonal ramjet case the statIc inlet and\noutlet pressures are set equal while in the annular\nflow ramjet the static pressure of the outlet\nstream will typically be greater than that at the\ninlet.\n\nADDITION\n\n} ZONE\n\nANNULAR\nNOZZLE\nTHROAT\n\nFig. 8.\n\nAnnular Flow Ramjet Configuration\n\nIt is noteworthy that by eliminating the need to\ntransfer electrical energy to the projectile itself\nand introducing the self-centering capability just\nalluded to, one mitigates two of the problems assocIated with such electromagnetic devices as the\nrail gun.\nThese problems relate to the design of\nsliding electrical contacts and the maintenance of\na tight tolerance on launch track straightness.\nRelaxation of the tolerance should for example\npermit longer track lengths and lower acceleration\nlevels than those required for railguns.\n\nFLUID MECHANICS MODEL\nSince fluid mechanical forces propel the vehicle it is approprIate to begin an analysis of the\nannular flow ramjet by determining the magnitudes\nof thermodynamic and fluid mechanical variables\nrequired to produce the desired thrust level. This\nanalysis must be considered preliminary and as a\nresult very much Simplified.\nThe first major\nassumption in this analysis is that the process can\nbe considered quaSi steady. It is recognized that\nat the acceleratIon levels being considered this\ncannot in fact be accurate.\nHowever, including\nunsteadiness introduces major complications in the\nanalysis. Estimates of the errors involved have\nindicated that though they are fairly substantial,\nthey are not so large as to render these prelim134\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen\nworking fluid will vary over the range of temperatures and pressures encountered during\nramjet\noperation primarily because of the effect of dissoCIation. For this preliminary analysis however it\nwas desirable to avoid the complications of temperature and pressure dependent specific heats and\ngas constants.\nFigures 9 and 10 show how the\nvalues of the ratio of specific heats and gas constant for hydrogen vary with temperature and pressure.\nIn general,\nduring\nramjet\noperation,\nIncreases\nin\ntemperature\nare accompanied by\ncorrespondIng increases in pressure.\nThIs being\nthe case Figures 9 and 10 suggest that it is not\ntoo unrealIstic to treat these two parameters as\nconstants. For the results contained in this paper\nideal gas behavior was assumed and a ratio of\nspeCIfic heats (y) of 1.4 and a gas constant (R) of\n4160 Joules/kgOK were used.\nExtensive analysis of the early phase of ramjet operation when a bow shock was propagated ahead\nof the prOjectile was also undertaken. Modeling of\nthis phase of operation was successful and showed\nthat with proper launch tube design the bow shock\nwould become attached as an conical shock without\ndiffIculty. However it also showed that positive\nramjet thrust could not be produced at the subsonic\ndiffusion inlet condItion that accompanies operation with a bow shock. It was therefore assumed\nthat acceleration to supersonic speeds and initia-\n\ntion of the isentropic diffusion process would be\naccomplished by some\nalternative\nacceleration\nscheme.\n17\n\n...\n\n16\n\n>::\nen\n\nI-\n\n<[\n\nL1J\n\nJ:\n\nU\nlL\n\nU\n\nL1J\n\na.\nen\n\nlL\n\n0\n\nQ\n\nI<[\n\n0::\n\n12\n\n250 aIm\n\nI I\n\n00\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\nTEMPERATURE (OK)\nF~g.\n\n9.\n\nRatio of Specific Heats for\nEquilibrium Hydrogen\n\n8000\n\n~\n\n:.:\n\n\xc2\xb0\n-\'"\n,\n...,\n\n7000\n\nco\n\n6000\n\nIZ\n\n<[\n\nI-\n\nen 5000\nz\n\n8\n(J)\n\n<[\n\n<!>\n\n4000\n250 aIm\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\nTEMPERATURE (OK)\n\nFig. 10.\n\nGas Constant for\n\nEquil~brium\n\nHydrogen\n\nTYPICAL SUPERSONIC LAUNCH CYCLE\n\n\'-\n\n"\n\nIf one assumes that the projectile will be\nacted upon by either the ramjet force or some\nexternally appl1ed force needed to produce the\ndesired acceleration, the prOJectile trajectory\nwill be known.\nWith the prOjectile\nvelocity\nprofile known the propellant flow veloc1ty relative\nto the ramJet is known at each position along the\nlaunch track. One can now prescr1be the diffuser\nthroat area requ1red at each posit10n along the\ntube so that the flow will remain sonic at this\nthroat.\nOne can also prescribe the heat supplied\nIlS\n\nin the subsonic heat addition region so that the\nspecified thrust will either be produced or the\nmach number at the exit of the heating region (in\nthe prOJectile frame of reference) reaches its max1mum allowable value of unity. After heat has been\nadded, the flow is accelerated isentropically 1n\nthe nozzle to the maX1mum supersonic mach number\nachievable under the constraint of the area change\navailable. The static pressure at the nozzle exit\nis determined by this expansion and it will vary\nwith prOjectile position. Proper control of this\npressure at the base of the proJect11e would have\nto be achieved in an actual device by proper design\nof the launch tube. Such a tube would consist of\ntwo sections, a cavity section into which hydrogen\nprocessed by the ramjet would be collected and the\nlaunch section through which the projectile would\npass.\nIt has been assumed in this analysis that\nthe cavity section could be designed to have the\nlength and cross sectional area needed to accommodate the propellant and facilitate maintenance of\nthe necessary projectile base pressure. While it\nseems possible to do this intuitively, the examination of the unsteady flu1d mechanics describing the\nprocess has not yet been attempted.\nFigure 11 shows the results of such\nan\nanallsis for the case where a constant thrust of 3\nx 10 Newtons is maintained on a 10 kg mass and the\nhydrogen in the launch tube is initially at 300 0K\n(T1 ) and 30 atmospheres(P ).\nThe\nprojectile\n1\nselected for this example has a fixed 16 cm diameter at the diffuser throat and an 8 cm diameter in\nthe heat addition region. These diameters are considered adequate to assure the structural integrity\nof the projectile during launch. As F1gure 11a\nshows the prOjectile velocity (in the launoh tube\nframe of reference) increases linearly with time.\nSince the propellant is initially at rest, relative\nto the tube wall the prOjectile velocity is equal\nto the propellant inlet velocity in the prOjectile\nframe of reference. The exhaust VelOClty (in the\nprOjectile frame of reference) is observed to be\nequal to the inlet velocity during the first -8\nmsec of operat10n so during this time interval\nessentially no net thrust is produced through the\nmechan1sm of momentum change of the propellant.\nAfter about 16 msec of operation, however, the\nexhaust veloc1ty has risen to about IS 1m/sec and\nbegun to level off. During the time between -8 to\n-16 msec all of the heat that can be added without\nchoking the flow (achieving un1ty mach number at\nthe end of the heat addition region) is being\nadded.\nAs Fig. lib shows the net r~Jet thrust 1S\ninadequate to meet the 3 x 10\nneuton thrust\nrequ1rement at times less than 16 msec.\nThus, an\nalternative accelerating scheme such as the constant pressure gun (discussed in the next section)\nwould have to be used during this time interval.\nAs the prOJectile velocity increases, more heat can\nbe added and this causes the increase in exhaust\nvelocity shown in F1g. l1a. After -16 msec both\nthe exhaust velocity and the mass flow rate h~ve\nrisen to the point where the desired thrust level\ncan be produced and the mach number after heat\naddition begins to drop below unity.\nF1gure 11c, which indicates projectile position as a function of time for this case of constant acceleration, shows a launch tube about 400 m\nlong would be required to accelerate the 10 kg mass\nto the terminal velocity of 1S,000 m/sec in -SO\n\nmsec.\nFigure 11d indicates the variation in tube\nand projectile diameters that would have to be\neffected to satisfy fluid mechanical constraints\nimposed on the ramjet. As the sketch suggests, the\nproJectile d1ameter at the diffuser throat and in\nthe heat addition region have been treated as fixed\nat 16 cm and 8 cm respectively. The reduction in\ntube diameter required to Y1eld unity mach number\nat the d1ffuser throat as the proJectile velocity\nincreases is shown by the solid lino.\nData from\nthis line takon together with the position profile\nof Fig. 11c spoc1fy how the tube diameter would\nhave to vary along its length. F1gure lId also\nshows that the projectile diameter at the nozzle\nthroat would have to increase as the projectile\nvelocity increases and the 1nput power is varied to\ninduce the desired thrust level. The fact that\nthis d1ameter must change during the launch cycle\nrepresents a significant mechanical complication in\nthe system. It is noted however that the amount of\nchange in this diameter becomes very small after\nabout 20 m sec when the prOJectile velocity is -S\nkm/sec.\nIt is antiCipated that a pressure or temperature sensitive scheme might be designed to\nfac11itate this change in projectile diameter at\nthe nozzle throat. Alternatively one could hold\nthe prOjectile diameter in the nozzle region fixed,\nreduce the tube diameter slightly more rap1dly that\nFig 11d suggests and abrade the diameter of the\nprOJectile at the diffuser throat using protrusions\nfrom the tube wall.\n\n20\n\nTUBE\n\n!r\n\n,, ,-\n\nw\n15\nI-w E 10\n::;:\n\n,~ NOZZLE REGION\n\n0\n\n<t-\n\no\n\n-\n\n5\n0\n\n0\n\n~!..\n\n50\n\n4000\n\nI-\n\n6000\n2000\n\nUI\n::;)\n\n<t\n\n00\n\nx\n\n40\n\nw\n\n15\n\n>-0\n\nf.\n\nI-\n\n50\n\nExhaust Temperature Profile\n\n10\n\n...J E\n\n60\n\nw""\n\n>5\n\n50\n0:: ~\n\n40\n\n:l\n\n30\n\nwe;\n\n20\n30\nTIME (msee)\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0\n\nQ.\n\n~\n\n0\n\n\xc2\xa7 20\n10\n\nVelocity Profiles\n\na.\n\n40\n\n8000\n\n:I:\n\n- .....\nu \'"\non\n0\n\n50\n\n10000\n\n\xc2\xa7; ~\n\nTt\n\n40\n\nPrOjectile Base Pressure Profile\n\ne.\n\n!r\nW\n\n20\n\n20\n30\nTIME (mue)\n\n10\n\n~\n\ncr = 30000 G\'s\nf\nm = 10 kO\n= 300 0 K\nPI = 300tm\n\n30\n20\nTIME (msce)\n\n10\n\nRequired Variation in Geometry\n\nd.\n\n~\n::;)\n\n8em dlo\n\nBODY\n\n-\n\n_ -\n\n------\n\n~ PROJECTILE\n\n\xc2\xb00~--~~--~2~0--~30~--~4~0--~50\nTIME (msee)\n\ng.\n20\n30\nTIME (msee)\n\nh.\n\n40\n\nFig. 11.\n\n50\n\nThrust Profile\n\n~!:~~~ ~\n\'1-\n\n~ iii 100\n\nc.\n\n~\n\nO~=---.1.----1....--~\'\n\no\n\n10\n\n20\n30\nTIME (mue)\n\n40\n\nTypical Electrothermal, Hydrogen Ramjet\nLaunch Cycle\n\nFigures 11e and Ilf indicate how the stat1c\npressure and temperature at the nozzle exit should\nvary to conform to the problem specifications. The\npeaks in temperature and pressure occur at the\npoint where the power input 1S a maximum (Fig.\n11g).\nThis in turn occurs at the t1me when the\nthrust has just reached its deSign value and the\nmach number at the end of the heat addition region\nis still at unity. At this cond1tion the exhaust\nvelocity is still relatively low and the bulk of\nthe thrust is being produced by the static pressure\ndifference across the prOjectile. If one did not\nstart using tho ramjot unt11 after -20 msec into\n\n~ Q 200\nQ.\n\nPower Profiles\n\n50\n\nPrOjectile Trajectory\n\n136\n\n...\n\nthe launch, we see that the exhaust pressure and\ntemperature would lie in a very moderate range\nthroughout the period of ramJet operation. Note\nthat It is the pressure profile of Fig. lie that\nwould have to be matched through proper design of\nthe cavity section of the launch tube. This might\nbe achIeved by selectIng not only the length and\ncross sectional area of this section but also by\nthe inclusIon of accumulator chambers that could be\nconnected into the tube at the proper t1me.\nThe temperatures of FIgure 11f are observed to\nbe relatIvely low.\nSo low In fact that It would\nprobably not be pOSSIble to add energy to the\nhydrogen using electromagnetic radiation to couple\nto the plasmA using the mechanism of inverse\nbremmstrahlung.\nIt is noted however that this is\nnot the case in the heat addItIon region where temperatures in the IO,OOOoK range needed to effect\nthIS energy additIon mechanism do prevail.\nFigure 11g shows the thermal power input profIle requIred to effect operatIon as well as the\nactual profile of mechanical power input to the\nproJectIle.\nAfter the -20 msec period over which\nthe auxIliary startIng force would be applied It is\nobserved that the ratio of projectile power to\nthermal Input power rises above -SO~. (An approximate mathematIcal relationshIp for this ratio is\ngIven in the next section.) The ramjet IS observed\nto become increasingly efficient as the launch\ncycle proceeds. This suggests that the ramjet will\nbe more effiCIent at the hIgher velocitIes where\nthe efficiencies of electromagnetic launchers drop\noff.\nThe difference between the projectile and\nthermal Input powers represents the power being\ndeposIted as kInetic and thermal energy In this\nhydrogen propellant. It should be noted here that\nfrozen flow losses in the nozzle and electricalto-thermal power conversion losses as well as frictional losses have been neglected in this preliminary analysis.\nAnalyses SImilar to the one leading to the\nresults of Fig. 11 have been carrIed out at other\nvalues of parameters such as the initial tube pressure and the diameter of the projectile at the\ndiffuser throat. They suggest that inadequate mass\nflow rates are brought on by low projectile diameters and low initial tube pressures. ThIs in turn\nleads to excessively high exhaust pressures and\ntemperatures as well as extremely hIgh thermal\npower demands.\nIt has also been determined that\nthe device will work if the nozzle is used as a\ndiffuser and the propellant is exhausted at a subsonic mach number and a hIgh statIc pressure.\n\nenergy would be added to a fixed quantity of gas at\nthe base (in back of) the projectile and the projectile would completely occupy the tube cross section. If acceleration is to be constant and the\ntube cross sectional area and projectile mass are\nconstant, then the pressure in the tube must be\nmaintained at a constant value as well during the\nacceleration. It is antiCipated that the transition from the gun to the ramjet phases of operation\nwould be accomplished when the projectile passed\nthrough a diaphragm containing the hydrogen in the\nsection of the tube to be used for ramjet operation. The section of tube between the initial projectile location and the diaphragm would be at low\npressure initially so no significant amount of gas\nwould be compressed ahead of the projectile during\nthe constant pressure phase.\nA SImple relationship between .the required\nrate of energy deposition to the gas Q and the projectile velocity v is obtained oaslly for the constant pressure (gun) phase of acceleration from the\nprinciple of energy conservation if frictional\neffects are ignored. This relationship is.\n(4)\n\nSince the rate of kinetic energy increase of the\nprojectile is m a g v the efficiency of the prof\ncess (ratio of rate f of kInetIC energy increase to\nrate of energy supplIed to drIven gas) must be\n(y -l)/y. If hydrogen IS taken to be the driver\ngas, y = 1.4, the efficiency is about 28.6~. ThIs\nis constant throughout tho acceleration process.\nThe energy not appearing as kinetic energy of the\nprOjectile must reside in the thermal energy of the\ndriver gas. The temperature of the gas driving the\nprOJectile must therefore increase substantially\nduring the acceleration. The magnitude of the rise\nis, of course, dependent on the mass of drivor gas\nused.\nOnce tho velocity necessary for effective ramjet operation is reached, operation of the projectile as a ramjet in the mode described in the\npreceeding section is initiated. It is of interest\nto develop an expression for the efficiency of this\nprocess and to compare it with the efficiency of\nthe constant pressure gun process. ApplIcation of\nconservation of energy to the ramjet results in the\nfollowing expression:\n\nQ\n\nCONSTANT PRESSURE GUN - RAMJET COMBINATION\n\nI-\n\nAs dIscussed above efficient ramjet operation\ndoes not occur until some critical projectile velocity is attained. Below thIS speed an auxiliary\nthrust device is required in order to maintain the\nconstant acceleration level assumed. In the example whose characteristic parameters are shown in\nFIgure 11 this velocity was reached at approximately 20 milliseconds. At this point the projectIle velOCIty was about 5900 m/s and the distance\ndown the tube about 59 m. One way of attaining\nthis necessary velocity would be to accelerate the\nprojectIle as in a gun and delay ramjet operation\nuntil this velocity was reached.

For the\ncombined\nconstant\npressure acceleratl0n-ramjet\nacceleration process the efficiency is approximately 6~.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe efficiency clearly varies with the projectile\nvelocity v.

In particular the effects of high\nacceleration and unsteady gal dynamic effects need\nto be considered and solutions that yield higher\nsystem efficiencies and/or more readily accommodated geometry changes need to be sought.\nResults\npresented in Flgure 11 suggest however that the\nelectrothermal ramjet designed to produce thrust\nafter belng given an initial velocity cannot be\nrejected on the basis that it violates a basic\nprinclple of fluid mechanlcs or thermodynamics.\nMoreover. on the basis of the same results it\nappears that the efficlency of the ramjet energy\nconversion process has the potentlal of being\nfairly high.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\n3.\n\ne\n\nF\n\n+\n\n4.\n\nQ= (\n\nU\n2v\n\n+ ~)\n\nmf\n\na f gv\n\nHildebrand.
