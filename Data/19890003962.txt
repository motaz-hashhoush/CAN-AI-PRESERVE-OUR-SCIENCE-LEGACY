Further\ndiscussion\nand recommendations\nfor future research\nare included\nat the end of the chapter.\nHow well\nthe conclusions\nfrom independent\nresearch\ntechniques\nfit together\nwas one of the exciting\naspects of the Workshop.\n2.0\n\nIN\n\nSITU\n\nMEASUREMENTS\n\nA time-of-flight\nmass spectrometer\nwas carried on board the Vega (PUMA)\nand Giotto\nPIA) spacecraft\nto record the composition\nof impacting\ndust particles\n(Kissel et al., 1986).\narticles striking the target\ngenerated\na cloud of ions which were accelerated\ndown a drift\ntube and counted\nby the detector,\nas a function\nof mass/charge\nratio.\nSeveral thousand\nmass spectra\nof dust particles\nin the mass range 10 -16 to 10 -12 g were recorded\nby the\nthree instruments.\nFrom a sample of PUMA spectra,\nthe relative\nabundances\nof the major rock -forming\nelements\nare chondritic\nwithin\na factor\nof 2 (Jessberger\net al.\n1986, 1987).\nCarbon,\nhowever,\nis enhanced\nby a factor of--- 10 in this sample,\ncompared\nto CI carbonaceous\nchondrites.\nA class of particles\ncontaining\nprimarily\nH,C,N,O\nwas discovered\n("CHON"\nparticles;\nKissel et al. 1986), supporting\nthe evidence\nfrom the infrared\nspectra\nthat Halley\nwas rich in organic\nmaterials.\nAt the Workshop,\nMason reported\non correlation\nanalyses\nof elemental\nabundances\nin\nover 8,000 PIA spectra\n(Mason\nand Clark, this Chapter).\nCarbon\nis the most abundant\nelement,\nappearing\nin 74 percent\nof all the spectra,\nwhile highest correlation\noccurs for the\npair C,O. The presence\nof molecular\nions, such as MgOH + and CN + is suggested\nby the\ndata.\nInitially,\nimpact.\nThe\n\nit was thought\nthat molecular\nions\nappearance\nof the spectra,\nhowever,\n\n5o\n\nwould not\nparticularly\n\nbe formed\nduring\nparticle\nthe peaks at large ainu,\n\nhas caused a reconsideration\nof the theoretical\nmodel for the impact\nprocess.\nKissel and\nKrueger\n(1987) have concluded\nthat molecular\nions are present\nin the data and have constructed\na model for the ion chemistry\nand the kinds of organic\nmolecules\npresent.\nThey\nargue that their model is indicative\nof the silicate\ncores with organic\nrefractory\nmantles,\npredicted\nfor interstellar\ngrains by Greenberg.\nFurther\nanalysis of the PUMA and PIA data is in progress\nby several groups, and we\ncan expect\ninteresting\nnew results\nto emerge\nin the next few years.\nHowever,\nit must be\nkept in mind that the instruments\nsampled\nonly the smallest\ngrains in the coma, whereas\nmost of the mass in the comet grains lies in particles\nlarger than 10 -11 g (see Chapter\n2).\n3.0\n\nINTERPLANETARY\n\nDUST\n\nPARTICLES\n\nFor more than 15 years, IDPs collected\nin the stratosphere\nhave been available\nfor\nlaboratory\nstudy. Recent advances\nin techniques\nfor analyzing\nsubmicron\nsections of these\ngrains and for obtaining\ninfrared\nspectra\nmake possible\na comparison\nwith Halley data.\nThese\ntechniques,\nincluding\nthin sections,\nEDX spectra,\nand ion-probe\nimaging,\nare reviewed in the paper by Walker, along with a discussion\nof results relevant to the comparison\nwith comet dust.\nUsing a different approach,\nBrownlee compared\nthe degree of variability\nin the mineral\ncomposition\nfor the Halley dust, carbonaceous\nchondrites,\nand IDPs.\nThe CI and CM\nmeteorite\nsamples contain\nprimarily\nhydrated\nsilicates,\nwith a narrow range in Mg/Si ratio,\nin contrast\nto the broad dispersion\nin composition\nand prevalence\nof pure Mg silicates\nin\nthe Halley particles.\nHydrated\nIDPs show a narrow range of Mg/Si similar to the meteorite\nsamples.\nThe anhydrous\nchondritic\naggregate\nIDPs, on the other hand, display\na broad\ncompositional\ndispersion\nsimilar\nto that seen in the Halley spectra.\nThese\nIDPs even\nlook like plausible\ncometary\nparticles,\nperhaps\nwith ice originally\nfilling the voids. Walker\ncautioned\nthat one should not rule out other kinds of IDPs as potential\ncometary\ngrains,\nfor example\nthe Ca and A1 rich refractory\nparticles\nand FSN particles\nas well as hydrated\nsilicates.\nRelationships\nbetween\nCHON particles\nand IDPs were also discussed.\nThe chondritic\naggregate\nIDPs contain\ndark, carbon-rich\nmatrix\nmaterial.\nSome IDPs may have a 3.4_m\nabsorption\nfeature,\nalthough\npossible contamination\nis difficult to rule out (see discussion\nby Walker).\nRaman\nspectra\nof IDPs, described\nby Allamandola\nand by Sandford,\nexhibit\nbands characteristic\nof aromatic\nmolecular\nunits of size <25A, and some showed red luminescence\nas well. The band positions\nare similar\nto the interstellar\ninfrared\nemission\nfeatures.\nSome IDPs have strong D/H enrichment\nin localized\nareas correlated\nwith high\ncarbon\nconcentration.\nAllamandola\net 02. associate\nthe high D/H enrichment\nwith polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons\nin the grains and suggest\nthat these may be only slightly\nmodified\ninterstellar\ngrains.\nWalker presented\nan ion image of an IDP containing\na fragment rich in C,H,N, perhaps\nrelated\nto a subset of the "CHON"\nparticles\nseen in Halley.\nThus, laboratory\nevidence\nregarding\nhydrocarbons\nin IDPs seems to be consistent\nwith\nwhat we have learned\nabout\nthe organic\nmaterial\nin Comet Halley, although\nfurther\ninvestigations\nof both IDPs and comets are clearly important.\nBetter\nunderstanding\nof the\norganic material\nin the grains is one goal of the CRAF mission.\n4.0\n\nINFRARED\nSPECTRA\nOF SILICATES\n\nOF\n\nIDPs\n\nAND\n\nIDENTIFICATION\n\nSandford reviewed the 5-20#m infrared\nspectra\nof IDPs. These fall into three groups,\nidentified\nrespectively\nwith terrestrial\nolivine,\npyroxene\nand hydrated\nsilicates.\nComposition analysis\nof the IDPs confirms\nthe spectral\nidentifications.\nA 6.8_m feature\nseen\nin hydrated\nIDPs is associated\nwith carbonate;\na weak 6.8#m emission\nmay have been\npresent in the spectrum\nof Halley (Chapter\n1). The silicate feature observed\nin Halley can\nbe fitted with a combination\nof the three spectral\ntypes, primarily\nolivine and pyroxene.\nThis result is in agreement\nwith Brownlee\'s\nconclusion\nthat anhydrous\nsilicates\ndominate\n51\n\nthe dust composition. In contrast,the 10/_m spectrum of Comet Kohoutek at 0.3 AU\nshowed a broad smooth silicateeature,resembling the hydrated silicates\nf\nand inconsistent\nwith more than a small per cent crystalline\nolivine.\nCaution should be exercised,\nhowever, in attempting to make a detailedfitof laboratory transmission spectra to cometary emission spectra. As discussed in Chapter 4, a\ntransmission spectrum generallyincludesscatteringas well as absorption,which can distort the shape of the band. The temperature and sizeof the emitting grains also have\nto be taken into account. One also has to consider the processing history of IDPs since\ntheirejectionfrom a parent body and the extent to which they may have been altered by\nheating. Nevertheless,given the difficulty f predicting accurately the band shape for a\no\nmixture of inhomogeneous, irregular\nparticles\n(Chapter 2),the directlaboratory comparison isa valuablefirst\nstep, and itissignificanthat crystallineilicateseem to be present\nt\ns\ns\nin Halley.\n5.0\n\nTHE\n\n3.4-MICROIN\n\nFEATURE\n\nThe observed\nspectrum\nof the 3#m region was described\nin Chapter\ni. The main\nemission peak occurs at 3.36_m, with weaker featuresat 3.29 and 3.52_m. Tokunaga and\nBrooke stressedthat the 3.36_m featureseen in Halley and Wilson isnot matched by any\ninterstellaxource. Although the Galactic Center has a feature centered near 3.4#m, the\ns\ndetailedshape differs\nand the feature is seen in absorption, not emission. Of the set of\nunidentifiedinfraredemission featuresusually occurring together in interstellar\nsources,\nonly the 3.29_m band seems to be present in Halley. Thus, the task for theoreticiansis\nto explain not only the originof the 3.36#m cometary emission, but also why it differs\nfrom that seen in the ISM and why no corresponding emission bands are present at longer\nwavelengths.\nMoreover, it appears that not all comets exhibit 3.4/_m emission (Tokunaga and\nBrooke), and Danks pointed out that no feature was evident in a preperihelionCVF\nspectrum of Halley in December 1985.\nWhile the consensus is that the emission probably arisesfrom C-H vibrations in organic molecules, the specificmolecule(s) and emission mechanism are unknown, and it\nis not even clear whether the carrieris in the gas or solid phase. Several possibleemission mechanisms were discussed at the Workshop and are described in the papers in this\nchapter. These include resonance scatteringby gas molecules, UV-pumped\nfluorescence\nin gas molecules or small grains,and thermal emission from small grains. Because the\nderived carbon abundance depends strongly on the emission mechanism, clarification\nof\nthe 3.36/_m featureis necessary for understanding the carbon budget of the comet.\nReferences\n1.
