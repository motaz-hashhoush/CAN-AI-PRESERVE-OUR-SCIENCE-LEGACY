They have modest payload mass & volume fractions. Active attitude control raises costs, and the deorbit rocket imposes risks which increase development and operational costs. This note describes an alternative concept now being developed under NASA funding. It uses a tether to both deorbit and orient the capsule. This allows simultaneous reduction of capsule complexity, cost, loads, hazards, and reentry errors. The flight of SEDS-1 in 1993 proved out the basic concepts. A 20 km tether slung a 26 kg payload back to earth from a 74O x 19O km orbit, accurately enough for a pre-positioned observer to videotape the reentry. As air drag built up just before reentry, the tether was blown back and became a kite-tail, with tension increasing as predicted before flight. The tether was still attached at approx. 110 km, when telemetry was lost.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980202357, "id": "58647464428d43859d2bd7f9d6fa2bb8", "publicationName": "Tether Technology Interchange Meeting", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19980202346, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Tether Technology Interchange Meeting", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
