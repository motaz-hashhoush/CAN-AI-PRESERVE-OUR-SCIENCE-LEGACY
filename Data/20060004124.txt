This study suggests it may be possible.\nThis report is a contract deliverable to NASA Glenn Research Center from the prime contractor, The\nBoeing Commercial Airplane Company of Seattle, WA. This study was supported by a separate contract\nto the Pratt & Whitney Engine Company of Hartford, CT (contract number NNC04QB58P).\nAviation continues to grow and with it, environmental pressures are increasing for airports that\nservice commercial airplanes. The feasibility and performance of an emissions-reducing technology,\nwater injection, was studied for a large commercial airplane (e.g., Boeing 747 with PW4062 engine).\nThe primary use of the water-injection system would be to lower NOx emissions while an important\nsecondary benefit might be to improve engine turbine life.\nA tradeoff exists between engine fuel efficiency and NOx emissions. As engines improve fuel\nefficiency, by increasing the overall pressure ratio of the engine\xe2\x80\x99s compressor, the resulting increased gas\ntemperature usually results in higher NOx emissions. Low-NOx combustors have been developed for new\nairplanes to control the increases in NOx emissions associated with higher efficiency, higher pressure ratio\nengines. However, achieving a significant reduction of NOx emissions at airports has been challenging.\nUsing water injection during takeoff has the potential to cut engine NOx emissions some\n80 percent. This may eliminate operating limitations for airplanes flying into airports with emission\nconstraints. This study suggests an important finding of being able to offer large commercial airplane\nowners an emission-reduction technology that may also save on operating costs.\nPotential Benefits\nInjecting purified atomized water into the combustor of a gas turbine engine will lower the flame\ntemperature. As NOx emissions are very sensitive to high flame temperatures, the injected water decreases\nNOx emissions some 80 percent when a 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio is used. Smoke emissions reductions of\napproximately 4\xc3\x97 have been observed during engine tests. HC and CO emissions will have very small, if\nany, increases. For a Boeing 747 aircraft, 400 gal of water would be required during its use from takeoff\nto 3000 ft altitude.\nAlthough water injection was previously used in older aircraft for additional thrust, this benefit was\nnot considered in the study. For example, if this new system failed during takeoff, the aircraft is assumed\nto maintain the same level of thrust. When keeping thrust constant while using water injection, a 120 \xc2\xb0R\ndecrease in turbine inlet temperature was calculated. Most of the life of a turbine blade is consumed\nduring the extreme conditions of takeoff. This 120 \xc2\xb0R temperature decrease during takeoff resulted in an\nestimated 29 percent increase in turbine life for a typical airplane operator. This life extension, minus the\nassociated water injection costs, results in an estimated 0.65 percent reduction in airplane-related\noperating cost.\nPotential Issues\nThe negative aspects of water injection were a 750-lb system weight increase. For an existing\nairplane, this can reduce airplane range approximately 60 n mi under some conditions and will consume\n20 gal more fuel on a 3000 n mi flight to carry the extra weight. For a newly designed airplane, the study\nassumed this range shortfall could be restored by increasing the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s fuel carrying capability. The\n400 gal of water, or 3340 lb of added takeoff weight, also reduces payload capability. However, as the\nwater-injection system is optionally used, the aircraft is assumed not to be filled with water on flights\nwith high passenger load factors. Another negative aspect is a 1.4 percent reduction in the engine\xe2\x80\x99s high-\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\niii\n\npressure compressor (HPC) surge margin. Some existing engines might be able to handle this level of\ndegradation, but others would have to undergo a turbine rematch, which would result in an estimated 0.4\npercent specific fuel consumption (SFC) penalty. A newly designed engine could potentially eliminate\nthis penalty. Test and certification costs for retrofitting an existing engine could approach upwards of $75\nM. Thus, recurring costs for a water-injection retrofit kit, would be much higher than for a newly\ndesigned engine. These costs, and the 0.4 percent SFC cruise penalty, make water injection unattractive\nfor retrofitting existing engines. However, for newly designed engines, these negative aspects may be\navoided. Other potential negative aspects have to do with engine operating issues and possible unforeseen\naffects of water injection.\nAnother method of misting water into the engine, via a finely atomized spray into the low-pressure\ncompressor (LPC), was briefly evaluated. However, a Pratt & Whitney performance model showed that\ncompressor surge margin deteriorated 9 percent for the LPC. This deterioration level was deemed\nunacceptable and the water-misting approach was not studied further.\nAirplane operator acceptance of water injection is unknown. However, in the past, airplane waterinjection systems were prone to maintenance difficulties and therefore have gained a poor reputation.\nWith improved design practices, these problems may be overcome, but the technology will probably still\nbe met with much resistance.\nAirport infrastructure issues of supplying the conditioned water can be substantial. Although\ndemineralized water costs have decreased substantially from earlier days, providing the conditioned water\nto airplanes at each airport gate may involve the installation of special supply systems. However, if\nairports can take credit for the reduction of emissions, the technology may be welcomed by those airports\nthat are constrained by NOx emissions.\nRecommendations\nModern turbofan engines are much more sophisticated than the early jet and turbojet engines that\nused water injection. Therefore, a modern aviation turbine engine demonstration of water-injection needs\nto be performed. With engine company involvement, water injection may be an ideal technology for\nNASA to pursue. To facilitate the potential introduction of water injection into any new engine design,\nand avoid the prohibitive additional certification costs, the water-injection system design and test should\nbe conducted in concert with new engine research and development (R&D) programs.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\niv\n\nContents\nExecutive Summary

In addition, this report provides answers to an earlier NASA-funded study\n(ref. 1) that questioned whether water injection into the combustor or water misting into the compressor\nwould be preferable. The earlier study also suggested there might be an improvement to turbine life when\nusing water injection and this study now provides quantitative estimates of turbine life and validates the\nearlier estimates of engine performance impact.\n1.2 Scope of Work\nThe following trade study evaluates the costs and benefits for various water-injection designs. The\nalternatives studied include water-injection installation on a newly designed large commercial airplane, a\nnew production airplane (i.e., 747-type aircraft) and the retrofit of Boeing 747\xe2\x80\x93400 aircraft that are\nalready in service.\nBoeing Commercial Airplane (BCA) group performed a preliminary design and analysis of the\nairframe portion of the water misting and injection systems. In addition, a system-level cost and benefit\nanalysis was performed on the entire airplane.\nPratt & Whitney Engine Company performed research on the engine portion of the task. This was\nsupported under a separate contract (NNC04QB58P) by NASA Glenn Research Center. They conducted\npreliminary design, performance analysis, and cost estimates of the engine portion of the water-injection\nsystem.\n1.3 Potential Benefits\nThis study fits with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals of reducing aircraft emissions and enabling aviation. Water\ninjection benefits are anticipated to\n-\n\nReduce airplane takeoff NOx emissions\nCut smoke emissions\nPossibly reduce airplane operator costs through improved engine life\nProvide a backup plan to other technologies (e.g., direct injection systems) to reduce airport\nNOx emissions\nOptimization of other engine design parameters by not having to focus on reducing LTO NOx\nlevels\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n1\n\n1.4 Potential Liabilities\nThere would also be issues to address with the water-injection system, which would result in\noffsetting the benefits. These include\n-\n\nairline and industry acceptance\nsignificant engine and aircraft system issues\nwater delivery logistics to the airplane\nreliability of the system to avoid its failure while in use at takeoff\neffect of the system on compressor operation\nweight of the system\nuncertain effect on engine durability\npotential for supply water freezing\n\nThese benefits will be explored in the following report and weighed against the liabilities for the\nvarious concepts with a recommendation made as to how to proceed.\n\n2.0 Study Method\nThe study method involved laying out a plan (sec. 2.1), figuring out what questions that needed to be\nanswered (sec. 2.2), defining the study assumptions (sec. 2.3), and selecting a case to study (sec. 2.4).\n2.1 Process\nThe study followed the planned steps listed below to ultimately generate a value for water-injection\ntechnology.\n1.

Calculate amount of water required for the water-injection systems\n4. Lay out two water-injection systems on the airframe\na. Low-pressure compressor (LPC) water-misting system\nb. Combustor water-injection system\n5. Estimate weight of airframe portion of the system(s)\n6. Obtain engine portion of system feasibility, design, and weights\n7. Evaluate airplane performance impact\n8. Calculate relative value of systems using trade study model\n9.

Estimate retrofit costs\n12. Calculate business case for new and retrofit cases\n13. Write final report\n14. Industry review of findings and feedback\n15. Submit final report\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n2\n\nResearch was conducted for airframe-related material on water injection. Boeing internal reports were\nobtained and interviews conducted with staff who worked on the 707, 747\xe2\x80\x93100, 747\xe2\x80\x93200, and DC10\xe2\x80\x9340\ncommercial airplane programs that had water-injection systems.\nThe Boeing Integrated Defense System group also provided feedback from their current experience\nof using water injection on the Boeing AV8B Harrier aircraft with Rolls-Royce Pegasus F402 engines\n(fig. 1).\nAdditional design and performance information for the water-injection system was provided by\nseveral companies and universities outside of this contract. Rolls-Royce plc. provided engine waterinjection design, performance information, and feedback that is included in the report. The Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT) provided estimates of turbine life impact of water. The University of\nColorado conducted a design study of the water refill system. Argo-Tech and Eaton Aerospace provided\nwater pump design, performance, and cost information, which are also included in the report. An\nengineering team from CH2M Hill provided data on water conditioning processes and costs. Lastly,\ninterviews were conducted with staff at Los Angeles International Airport to assess the infrastructure\nissues and desirability of water injection.\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection is currently used on Boeing Harrier aircraft.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n3\n\n2.2 Work Tasks\nWhen selecting the study work tasks, the first step was to determine what systems would be impacted\non the airplane by water injection. In addition, work tasks were generated to answer specific questions\nthat were spelled out in the contractor\xe2\x80\x99s statement of work.\nThe work tasks specific to the engine were to be addressed by Pratt & Whitney. Boeing and Pratt &\nWhitney jointly agreed on the engine questions needing to be answered and fed back to Boeing.

Ground rules are\nlisted in table II.\nA major assumption was that water injection would not be used for additional thrust. This was to\neliminate any issues that might arise due to potential safety concerns. Namely, if the aircraft were to\ndepend on the additional thrust that water injection could offer, and the system failed at a crucial point,\nthe airplane could be put in peril.\n\nTechnology and Requirements\nDate:\n\nTechnology Readiness is 2007\n\nAircraft:\n\nNewly designed 747-sized airplane, new 747 production, and in-service 747\xe2\x80\x93400 for retrofit\n\nEngines:\n\nPratt & Whitney PW4062 for in-service retrofit aircraft.

In the previous lessdetailed water-injection feasibility study (ref. 1), a Boeing 777 airplane was used as this airplane is a\nhigh-tech, newly designed baseline aircraft that is used in many trade studies. For this study, a 747 aircraft\nwas chosen. This is because older versions of the 747 previously used water injection, therefore, more\ndesign information is available. In addition, these engines were deemed to be easier to incorporate water\ninjection as an aftermarket retrofit kit.\n2.4.1 Airframe.\xe2\x80\x94For the case of a current production aircraft (statement of work (SOW) task 1.1), a\nnew Boeing 747-type aircraft was chosen as the study platform. For the case of an in-service aircraft for\nretrofit (SOW task 1.2), a Boeing 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER aircraft was chosen.\nThe 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER (extended range) is available in both passenger and freighter versions. It is the same\nsize (fig. 2) as the original 747\xe2\x80\x93400s, but has a higher payload and range. The 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER has a\nmaximum takeoff weight of 910 000 lb (412 770 kg). This takeoff weight increase of 35 000 lb\n(15 876 kg) over older 747\xe2\x80\x93400s allows operators to fly about 410 n mi (760 km) farther or carry up to 15\n000 lb (6800 kg) more payload, either in the form of extra cargo or a full load of 416 passengers.

A current\nproduction airplane would suffer many of the same water-injection system nonrecurring development\ncosts as a retrofit airplane. Therefore, study assumed that a new airplane would be developed to include\nwater injection. Figure 3 shows the new production and retrofit airplanes used in the study.\nFor the newly designed airplane, a PW4000-type engine was used in the analysis. In this case, the\nengine would be developed from new with an optional water-injection system designed into the\nconfiguration.\n2.4.2 Engine Model.\xe2\x80\x94For the retrofit and production airplane study cases, the airplane was\nconsidered to have PW4062 engines. This series of engines were the first model in Pratt & Whitney\'s\nhigh-thrust family for large aircraft and achieves a top thrust rating of 62 000 lb of thrust for the 747. The\nengine has single-crystal superalloy materials and full-authority digital electronic control (FADEC). The\nengine is used on the Boeing 747 and 767, as well as two other European airplanes.\nIn November 2002, Pratt & Whitney certified a new high-pressure compressor (HPC) case design for\nthe engine. The design is based on the PW4000\xe2\x80\x93112 and has begun production incorporation and is also\navailable to airlines for incorporation at overhaul. The new design was needed to improve compressor\nblade tip clearance control, which also resulted in improved fuel efficiency, performance retention, and\nexhaust gas temperature (EGT) margin.\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94A new 747-sized airplane, a new production 747, and a\n747\xe2\x80\x93400ER were used for the airplane study platforms.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n7\n\nEngine Characteristics\nFan tip diameter: 94 in.\nTakeoff thrust: 52 000 to 62 000 lb\nFlat rated temperature: 86 or 92 \xc2\xb0F\nBypass ratio: 4.8-to-1 to 5-to-1\nOverall pressure ratio: 27.5 to 32.3\nFan pressure ratio: 1.65 to 1.80\nProgram Milestones\nDecember 1982\xe2\x80\x94Program launch\nAugust 1985\xe2\x80\x94First flight\nJune 1987\xe2\x80\x94Revenue service\nNovember 2002\xe2\x80\x94Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 33 Certification HPC Ring Case\n\n3.0 Results\nAn airframe water-injection system was designed, based primarily on the heritage 747\xe2\x80\x93200 waterinjection system, for the combustor water-injection system and the compressor water-misting system.\nAirframe system weights were calculated and combined with engine system weights obtained from the\nsubcontractor. Airplane performance impact was calculated from aerodynamic models. These\nperformance results, plus engine maintenance numbers obtained from the subcontractor, along with\nestimated engineering nonrecurring and airplane recurring costs, were fed into several design trade\nmodels to evaluate the relative worth of water-injection technology. An estimated customer business case\nwas calculated.\n3.1 Problems With Previous Water-Injection System\nFigure 4 shows some of the maintenance issues that were identified with the early water-injection\nsystem on the Boeing 747. On the airframe side, 6061\xe2\x80\x93T6 aluminum tubing was used for the water supply\nand distribution systems. The engine requires demineralized water which is more corrosive to the\nairframe water tanks and tubing material than ordinary tap water. This resulted in substantial corrosion\ntaking place which often blocked valves and controllers and also lead to corrosion of the wetted portions\nof the water pump. In addition, the location of the water tanks in the wing lead to some freezing problems.\nOn the engine side, the earlier engines had a spray distribution bar that was placed downstream of the\nHPC diffuser. This water-injection method resulted in some water, or cooled air, impacting the engine\ncase that lead to distortion and thermal stressing problems. In addition, a sizable portion of water-cooled\nair was thought to enter through the combustor dilution holes, which are located just upstream of the\nhigh-pressure turbine nozzle and blades. This resulted in increased noise and a poor thermal pattern\nfactor, which can significantly reduce the life of the engine turbine blades. The water-injection system\nwas activated via a microswitch on the throttle quadrant. Perhaps introducing water suddenly in this\nmanner might have also resulted in thermal shock to the hot section. Many who remember water injection\nalso remember these associated maintenance problems, therefore older water-injection systems have\nacquired a poor reputation.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n8\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94There were several problems with older water-injection systems,\nwhich gave it a poor reputation.\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Good design practices can address previous water-injection problems.\n\n3.2 New Water-Injection System Design\nThe previous section (3.1) of this report showed that there were several durability shortfalls with the\noriginal water-injection system. These previous problems can be overcome by being cognizant about\nthem and using good design practices for future water-injection systems.\nFigure 5 illustrates that the previous system corrosion problems can be addressed by using corrosionresistant steel (CRES). In addition, new composite materials can be used to replace many of the older\naluminum parts. The freezing problems in the water tanks can be addressed by locating the tank into a\nwarmer part of the airplane. The engine maintenance problems can be addressed by using the type of\nwater-injection nozzle used in current industrial engines. The previous high cost of conditioned water can\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n9\n\nbe addressed by the implementation of newer reverse osmosis (RO) water conditioning equipment\n(ref. 1). Portable water conditioning units on the market in 2004 delivered water for less than $0.02 per\ngal. For fixed base units, the costs would be around $0.01/gal (ref. 8).\n3.2.1 System Layout.\xe2\x80\x94Three airframe-based water-injection system schemes were studied: single\npump, dual pump, and quad pump configurations. The quad pump configuration, where each engine has\none water-injection pump, was the final selected configuration. This was due to electrical in-rush current\nissues and weight associated with the other configurations.\nFor either the water misting or (one-, two-, or four-pump) water-injection system designs, several\ncommon airframe themes need to be addressed; water freezing is one. Once the water is exhausted after\ntakeoff, any residual water needs to be drained through a heated drain mast. If water were to be used all\nthe way to top of climb, the tanks would need to be protected from freezing. On days when the ambient\ntemperature approaches freezing conditions (i.e., 32 \xc2\xb0F for water injection or 40 \xc2\xb0F for water misting), the\noperator could either choose to not use the system or takeoff within a prescribed period of time (i.e.,\nwithin 60 min if the water was 50 \xc2\xb0F or higher at refill).\nThe pump needs to provide a fluid pressure higher than the combustor pressure to atomize the water\nin the injection nozzle. However, very high pressure will require too much power to drive the pump.\nThese are discussed in more detail below.\n3.2.1.1 Single Pump Configuration: In this configuration, one electrical motor and pump would\nsupply water to all four engines. This design was not chosen because the pump\xe2\x80\x99s drive motor had too high\nof an in-rush current for the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s electrical supply system. In addition, the pump manufacturer\nreported that a single large electrical motor was much heavier than four smaller electrical motors; at least\nfor this design round.\nFigure 6 shows the initial design concept of the single pump system. The heart of the system is an\n800-psi, 240-gpm water pump. The original design assumption for this configuration was that a single\npump and support tubing would be lighter weight and less complex. A single pressurized water supply\nline would run forward from the pump and then split into smaller supply lines to each engine, thereby\nsaving weight.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Single\xe2\x80\x93pump water-injection system concept.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n10\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Single-pump installation would\nhave a very large, heavy electrical motor.\nThe water-injection pump\xe2\x80\x99s electrical drive motor was the determining factor in this system not being\nselected. Namely, a single motor in the 200 hp range was a nonstandard design. The motor manufacturer\nwas unsure of the weight associated with this type of challenging design and therefore provided a\nconservative (i.e., heavy) weight. In addition, the motor would exhibit a large electrical in-rush current\nthat would overwhelm the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s electrical system. More details for the single pump performance are\nfound in section 3.2.4.\nAlthough not explored in detail, one possible solution to this would be to drive the water pump with a\npneumatic motor. As the pumps are located relatively close to the Environmental Control System (ECS)\npacks, the pumps could conceivably be driven with compressed air diverted from the ECS packs.\nThe suction feed lines would be joined in a common manifold as shown in figure 7. The pump is very\nsensitive to cavitations so the first tank to run dry would shut down the system.\nOther issues, as illustrated in table IV, are the control of the water delivery system and safety\nconcerns. When a single pump is supplying water to four engines with different consumption levels, it\nbecomes more difficult to maintain pump pressure and overall flow rate.\nThere could be a potential safety issue with the single-pump configuration. Namely, during operation,\nthere is 112 (fluid) hp of energy in the single water supply line running under the cargo floor. If the line\nshould rupture, it could release enough energy to damage other components. This would need to be\nfurther investigated.\nTABLE IV.\xe2\x80\x94SINGLE WATER PUMP DESIGN PROS AND CONS\nPros\nSimpler system\nLess tubing\nLightweight potential\n\nCons\n(Nonstandard) pump motor (heavy)\nVery high in-rush current\nTank water distribution (first tank to run dry cavitates pump)\nMore control issues between one pump and four engines\nPotential safety issue if single supply line bursts (more available energy)\n\n3.2.1.2 Dual Pump Configuration: In this configuration, two pumps supply water to four engines.\nThis configuration was also not selected as the optimal design as there was also an in-rush current issue\nand the two pumps weighed more than four pumps.\nFigure 8 shows a high-level design of the proposed two-pump water-injection system. It incorporates\ntwo 800 psig, 120 gpm pumps with electrically driven motors. Each of the combined electric motor and\npump were estimated to weigh 120 lb. This is much higher than two of the existing 60 gpm single pumps\nthat weigh 27.5 lb each.\nFigure 9 illustrates the pump installation scheme and proposed water tanks. Four of the eight water\ntanks would be manifolded together and a pump installed into one of the tanks with a suction feed line to\nthe bottom of that tank. The other four tanks would be similarly manifolded together with the second\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n11\n\npump installed into one of those tanks. Two high-pressure feed lines would run forward from the two\npumps.\nTable V lists the design pros and cons of the two-pump water-injection system configuration. This\nsystem was originally thought to have weight and simplicity benefits over a four-pump configuration.\nHowever, the pump manufacturer (ref. 2) claimed the motor and pump configuration would still weigh\nmore, and have high in-rush current issues. More detailed pump information is listed in section 3.2.4.\nTABLE V.\xe2\x80\x94DUAL PUMP PROS AND CONS\nPros\nSimpler system than four-pump\nLess tubing\nLighter weight potential\n\nCons\nHeavy electric pump motor\nStill too high in-rush current\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Dual water pump configuration.\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Dual-pump installation into water tanks.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n12\n\n3.2.1.3 Quad Pump Configuration: This was the ultimate configuration chosen for the water-injection\nsystem. It exhibited the lightest weight and easiest means of dealing with the current\nin-rush issues.\nFigure 10 shows the layout for the airframe portion of the water-injection system. It incorporates four\n800-psig, 60-gpm pumps. Each pump is installed in one of the left water tanks. Each of those tanks are\nmanifolded to an adjacent right water tank.\nA water service panel (13) is mounted on the bottom part of the aircraft where the ground service\npersonnel would fill the aircraft with 400 gal of demineralized water through the fill port (4). A fill and\nequalization line (7) leads from the service panel and connects all the tanks. Three check valves (21) are\ninstalled on the fill line to prevent water from draining from the most forward tank to the aft tanks during\naircraft takeoff and climbout. An overflow line (11) is connected to each tank so that water can drain\noverboard in the event the ground service personnel do not pay attention to the quantity indication gage\n(5) and the tanks are overfilled.\nThe tanks and supply lines need to be drained after the water is consumed at a 3000-ft altitude. A\nsolenoid drain valve (20) is connected to each of the pressurized lines. This valve, the antisiphon valve\n(17), and the engine drain line (not shown) open to drain the lines and prevent the entrained water from\nfreezing. The water tanks are drained via a tank drain valve (18) to a heated drain mast (21) that is located\non the outside, bottom part of the aircraft. The tank vents (24) equalize the pressure inside the tanks with\nthe cabin pressure. The higher cabin pressure inside the tanks assures positive water drain flow through\nthe system to the outside of the aircraft where atmospheric pressure is lower. Once the system is drained,\nthe drain valves close to prevent excessive pressure differential on the tanks which could ultimately\ncollapse the tanks.\nPressure transducers (15) are located on each pressure line to signal the engine that water is available\nfor injection and also assist the flow regulator (12) to control the water flow. The flow regulator would\ngradually introduce water to the engine to avoid thermally shocking the hot section. In addition, each\npump would shut down when a pressure loss signal is received.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Quad-pump design for water-injection system was chosen.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n13\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94The 747 water-injection simple parts list for study.\n\nFigure 11 shows a high-level parts list that was used in the study for the quad-pump water-injection\nsystem. Much of the selected system is similar to the heritage 747\xe2\x80\x93200 water-injection system. Many of\nthe smaller parts (clamps, fittings, wire connectors, etc.) were not included in this parts list in order to\nmake the study more manageable.\nDetails of critical system components in the water-injection system are discussed in the following\nsections.\n3.2.2 Water Tanks.\xe2\x80\x94Selecting the location of the water tanks turned out to be a very involved work\ntask. It was originally envisioned that two, 200-gal water tanks would each be placed in the same wing\nroot location as the heritage 747\xe2\x80\x93200 water-injection system (fig. 12).\nThe overall benefits of this location were being able to locate the tanks close to the engine, that it is a\nrelatively unused space, there might be less resistance from the design community since the airplane had\ntanks there previously, and there is good structural support available in this area.\nHowever, four concerns were found with locating the water tanks in the wing roots. As shown in the\nleft portion of figure 13, when looking inside the wing leading edge from the wing root towards the wing\ntip, one sees that the present ECS duct runs directly through the space where the water tanks would be\nplaced. This could be moved for new airplane designs, but presents a challenge for retrofit cases.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n14\n\nFigure 12.\xe2\x80\x94First considered traditional water-injection wing tank location.\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94Wing tanks would be very difficult to install for a retrofit\nand ECS duct location would need to be changed.\nSecondly, a design assumption made for this study, was that the water-injection system should be able\nto fit a new airplane design as well as a retrofit airplane. In this case, for a new airplane design, the wing\nroot space on future designs is anticipated to be occupied by the Ram Air Turbine so that only one wing\ncould contain a water tank. There is insufficient space in the present wing root to house one\n400-gal water tank.\nThirdly, another issue is the ease of retrofit-ability of the water-injection tank. Looking at the rightmost part of figure 13, one sees the approximate shape and dimension of a 200-gal water tank. Not only is\nthe ECS duct in the way, but in order to fit the water tank into the space, much of the existing fixed\nstructure would have to be reworked. This would involve substantial structural rework that would\nundoubtedly result in a much more expensive retrofit option.\nLastly, mounting the tank in the wing would subject any water to freezing conditions. Although this\nissue was manageable for older aircraft, it did present the operator with another operability issue to\ncontend with.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n15\n\nFor the above reasons, another location for the water-injection tanks was needed. Fortunately,\nthis study was able to borrow ideas from another Boeing study that looked at relocating the potable\nwater tanks from the front spar of the aircraft. Of these options, the most probable location for the\n400-gal-water-injection tanks was under the cargo floor, just aft of the main wing box spar (fig. 14). The\nadvantage of this location is that it is out of the extreme cold environment, is much easier to access and\nretrofit, and the tanks are much easier to remove for inspection or repair. The disadvantages are that the\ntanks are further away from the engines (adds weight due to increased tubing length) and the multiple\ntanks were required to reach 400-gal capacity.\nAvailable space on an airplane is often difficult to find. This open space was previously occupied by a\ncargo loading mechanism that was removed on newer model 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER airplanes. Figure 15 shows the\nopen area where the water tanks would be installed. There are some wires that would need to be moved to\naccommodate the tanks.\n\nFigure 14.\xe2\x80\x94The 747 water tank location selected was located under the cargo floor.\n\nFigure 15.\xe2\x80\x94This location on 747 is available to house 400-gal water tanks.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n16\n\nThere are also several tubes and ECS ducts in this location that are not shown in the figure. These are\nmore difficult to move, therefore, each of the four tanks would need to be split in half. Figure 16 shows\nthe tubing running up through the middle part of the aircraft and the tank pairs that would be installed to\nfit between the structural frames.\nFigure 17 shows a CAD model of the installed water tanks from the top view. Each tank measures\n14.6 in. deep to fit between the 747 aircraft structural frames. The left tank measures 61 in. wide and the\nright tank measures 14.5 in. wide. These tanks are anticipated to be manufactured from composite\nmaterial to reduce weight and eliminate any corrosion problems.\n\nFigure 16.\xe2\x80\x94The 747 water-injection tanks would fit between frames.\n\nFigure 17.\xe2\x80\x94Proposed 747 water-injection tanks (top view).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n17\n\nThe three-view illustrated in figure 18 shows the tanks looking from the front part of the aircraft aftwards. The tank on the port side of the aircraft measures 24.3 in. high and has a 75 gal capacity. Room\nneeds to be made for water and air expansion, as well as tank venting, and therefore, the fill capacity is\nlimited to 63 gal. The starboard tank measures 22.7 in. high and has a 45 gal capacity with a 38 gal fill\ncapacity. Together, each pair of tanks has a fill capacity of 100 gal of water.\nEach of the tanks on the left (port) side of the aircraft incorporates a water pump as shown in\nfigure 19. The pump portion resides inside the tank while the electric motor is positioned outside the\ntank. A suction feed line attaches to the pump inlet and runs to the bottom of the tank (not shown). A\ncomposite equalizing line runs between the two tanks to assure they have the same water level because\nthe pump draws water only from the left tank. Overflow lines from each tank are shown leading to a\ncommon line.\n\nFigure 18.\xe2\x80\x94Proposed 747 water-injection tank (front and side views).\n\nFigure 19.\xe2\x80\x94Boeing 747 water-injection tank with water pumps.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n18\n\nEach of the water pumps has a dedicated 1.25-in. OD (outer diameter) water line running forward to\nthe engine it serves (fig. 20). These water lines are anticipated to run parallel to other tubing that runs\nalong the length of the aircraft.\nIn the event of a catastrophic engine failure, water tank leakage paths and tank penetration need to be\naddressed.\n3.2.3 Tubing.\xe2\x80\x94As the water tanks are located aft of the main wing box, there will be a substantial\ndistance between the tank-mounted water pumps and the engines. Figure 21 illustrates that the\napproximate distance is 1884 in. (157 ft) to the outboard engine and 1391 in. (116 ft) to the inboard\nengine. This long distance will result in fluid pressure loss and higher tubing weight. Therefore a large\ndiameter tube needs to be used to reduce line losses and weight issues become important.\nThe heritage 747\xe2\x80\x93200 water-injection system used 6061\xe2\x80\x93T6 aluminum tubing in the supply and\npressure lines. Demineralized water can be more corrosive than ordinary tap water. Presumably it was this\nmaterial incompatibility that led to the many corrosion problems this system experienced. Therefore, a\ncorrosion-resisting steel is proposed to be used. The weight penalty of these materials are typically higher\nthan aluminum. Section 3.4.1 shows that a stainless steel tubing would weigh approximately\n325 lb. For this reason, lighter weight (but more costly) titanium tubing was used in the design. The\ntubing weight for this material was estimated to be 210 lb.\nOne of the difficulties in working with titanium tubing is that special fittings and installation methods\nare required. \xe2\x80\x9cOff the shelf\xe2\x80\x9d aerospace fittings are available in sizes up to 1.5-in. OD for operating\npressure up to 5000 psi and are constructed of 6Al\xe2\x80\x934V titanium. Figure 22 shows the installation of a\nfitting on the left and the special compression tool on the right.\nAs the wing flexes upwards and downwards during flight, other flexible full coupling fittings also\nneed to be used on the wing to allow flexure in the water-injection lines.\nAll of the titanium lines are to be drained of water after each use of the water-injection system. This is\nto avoid the possibility of water freezing in the lines. The drain line is attached to a heated drain mast that\nis located on the bottom of the aircraft (fig. 23). The drain mast is envisioned to be similar to current\nwater drain masts that have vortex generators designed into the bottom of the mast to direct water\ndownwards and away from the aircraft so that ice does not accumulate on the bottom of the aircraft.\n\nFigure 20.\xe2\x80\x94Boeing 747 water-injection tanks use 1.25-in. OD pressure lines.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n19\n\nFigure 21.\xe2\x80\x94Boeing 747 water-injection system pressure supply line dimensions.\n\nFigure 22.\xe2\x80\x94Titanium tubing and high-pressure fittings would most\nlikely be used to reduce weight and corrosion problems.\n\nFigure 23.\xe2\x80\x94Water drain mast must be heated to avoid ice formation.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n20\n\n3.2.4 Water Pumps.\xe2\x80\x94Three sizes of water-injection pumps were evaluated from two different\nmanufacturers (refs. 2 and 3). The pump sizes corresponded to using one, two, or four pumps to feed\nwater to the engines and would deliver 240, 120, or 60 gpm, respectively. All of the pumps delivered the\nwater at 800 psi pressure. Details of each pump are discussed below.\n3.2.4.1 Quad pump (60 gpm) configuration: this was the pump design selected as the optimal\nconfiguration for the water-injection system design. Namely, four pumps to supply water to the four\nengines. The determining factor in the selection of this pump was the light weight (29 lb) and the low\npower requirements (37 kW), which would lead to more manageable current in-rush levels.\nThis pump design (fig. 24) was based on the heritage Argo-Tech aircraft water-injection pump model\nnumber 60273\xe2\x80\x938 for the Boeing 747 water-injection system. The pump is a multistage centrifugal-type\ndesign with a total of two stages to generate the rated pressure of 800 psi. An inducer is employed to\nlower the net positive suction head (NPSH) requirement and improve the altitude performance. In order to\nreduce the weight, a two-pole motor is used to drive the pump at high rotational speed. Depending on the\nflow and pressure regulation requirements, additional flow or pressure regulating valves may be used in\nthe discharge or bypass lines.\nThe pump has a terminal block for connecting the three-phase wiring for the pump motor. The water\noutlet of the pump is located around the outside of the electrical motor and provides some cooling action.\n3.2.4.2 Dual pump (120 gpm) configuration: This pump scheme was not selected due to the higher\nin-rush current that it would experience, which would overcome the capability of the aircraft\nelectrical system.\nThe pump configuration (fig. 25), where two pumps supply water to the four engines, incorporated a\ntwo-stage centrifugal impeller was simple, had low relative weight, and had high-speed capability. The\ntwo-stage design allows for maximizing efficiency. An inlet inducer is provided to allow a minimum inlet\npressure of 10 psia. The approximate pump characteristics are as follows:\n\nPump\n\nElectric Motor\n\nImpeller diameter\n\n4.3 in.\n\nOutput power\n\n89 hp (66 kW)\n\nEfficiency\n\n63 percent\n\nEfficiency\n\n88 percent\n\nInput power\n\n89 hp\n\nInput power\n\n75 kW\n\nWeight\n\n25 lb\n\nWeight\n\n70 lb\n\nOutput pressure\n\n800 psig\n\nPower factor (full)\n\n76 percent\n\nInlet pressure\n\n10 psia\n\nFull-load current\n\n286 A\n\nFlow (max.)\n\n120 gpm\n\nStarting (in-rush) current\n\n1100 A\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n21\n\nFigure 24.\xe2\x80\x94The 747 water-injection single pump used for study.\n\nFigure 25.\xe2\x80\x94Dual pumps were also evaluated but not pursued due to high in-rush current.\n3.2.4.3 Single pump (240 gpm) configuration: This pump configuration would have had a single\npump supplying water to the four engines. It was not selected due to very high in-rush current and also\nhigh motor weight.\nA four-pole motor driving a two-stage impeller at 11 000 rpm and a two-pole motor driving a singlestage impeller at 22 000 rpm were both considered. However, both pump motors would require about\n147 kW (197 hp) of electrical input power requiring 430 amps per phase. In-rush current to this motor\nwould overwhelm the 747 electrical supply system. In addition, the weight of the electric motor alone was\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n22\n\nestimated to be in the 200 lb range. For this reason, the single electrically driven pump configuration was\nabandoned.\nOther single-pump design options might be for a hydraulic or pneumatic-driven motor. These options\nmight provide lighter weight systems and should be further explored before any design configuration is\nfinalized.\n3.2.5 Electrical System.\xe2\x80\x94The aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s electrical supply system plays an important role in the design\nof the water-injection system. Namely, there must be enough surplus electrical power available on the\naircraft to drive the water-injection pump motor(s) during takeoff.\nThere is a tradeoff to the system water pressure and electrical power requirements that must be\nconsidered in the system design. High water pressure will assure good atomization and distribution of the\nwater inside the engine\xe2\x80\x99s combustor. However, the power (fluid horsepower) required to drive the system\nis dependent on the pump\xe2\x80\x99s pressure and flow rate (eq. 3.1), therefore a higher pump pressure will require\na larger electrical drive motor.\n\nPower (F hp ) =\n\nP(psi ) \xc3\x97 Q(gpm )\n1714\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe minimum system pressure deemed acceptable for proper atomization was 300 psi higher than the\nengine\xe2\x80\x99s combustor pressure. This resulted in a system pressure of 800 psig. Assuming a 53 percent\nconversion efficiency (which was supplied by the pump manufacturers) between electrical (kW) power\nand fluid (hp) power, a peak electrical power of 137 kW was required to drive the four water-injection\npumps. This peak power draw would occur during the takeoff and initial climbout phase of flight for\napproximately 90 seconds as shown in figure 26.\nThe next step was to see if the aircraft could supply this level of electrical power. There are four\nintegrated drive generators (IDG) on the 747 aircraft that supply power to four electrical buses. These\nfour IDGs have the capability to provide excess electrical power to the aircraft. Therefore, should one of\nthe IDGs become inoperative, the aircraft can still operate safely and can even continue to be dispatched\nfrom the airports until a reasonable time can be found to repair the inoperative IDG. Figure 27 shows the\nnormal peak electrical loads for each bus on the aircraft during takeoff and climbout. It shows that this\nload requirement falls below the three-generator capacity and far below the four-generator. When adding\nthe 137-kW electrical power requirement to the existing aircraft loads, one can see that this new level fits\nwithin the four-generator capacity level.\n\nFigure 26.\xe2\x80\x94The 800-psig pumps require a lot of electrical power to drive them.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n23\n\nFigure 27.\xe2\x80\x94Pumps could be powered by four generators\nbut could not be used in three-generator dispatch mode.\nThe steady-state electrical power draw from the four pumps falls just within the capability of the\naircraft. However, when starting each pump, there is a sudden current in-rush that could overwhelm the\nelectrical system capability. Therefore, it is envisioned that there would be a timed phase-in of each\npump\xe2\x80\x99s startup. For instance, pump numbers 1 and 2 might be started simultaneously. Pump number 3\nwould start next, followed closely by pump number 4. If peak power requirements were still exceeded,\nthen another aircraft electrical load, such as galley(s), could be temporarily shed for the 2.4 min that\nwater-injection system is operating.\n3.2.6 Water Refill System.\xe2\x80\x94Another issue needing to be resolved is how to quickly fill the water\ntanks while also reducing the chance of untrained personnel possibly refilling the water-injection system\nwith contaminated water, which could quickly ruin the engines. Section 3.3.3 discusses the water quality\nrequirements in more detail.\nA water service panel was designed to be located as near the water tanks as possible to reduce weight\nof the refill lines inside the aircraft. Figure 28 shows that the panel is located on the left side of the aircraft\njust aft of the main wing box spar, which is directly under the water tanks. A water service access door is\ndesigned so that the ground service personnel can open the door to reveal the refill port. A water gage is\nprovided to assure the service personnel that the tanks are indeed full when serviced with 400 gal of\nwater. A drain switch and light are also provided. This switch will activate the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s drain valve so\nthat water can be offloaded through the fill valve by the water service truck. A check valve is\nincorporated into the fill valve so that water cannot accidentally be drained unless the hose is connected.\nFigure 28 also shows an example of what a (conditioned) water service truck might look like.\nDepending on the height of the aircraft and the access panel, some aircraft might require that the service\npersonnel be lifted up to the service point.\nThe water refill system should provide a system pressure of 30 psig (at the service panel) and a flow\nrate of 100 gpm. This will allow the water tanks to be refilled in 4 min. A specialized water service truck,\nor filling station, was envisioned to fill the airplane while parked at the terminal gate. The equipment\nwould contain a tank for the demineralized water, pump, hose, refill nozzle, and water contamination\nsensor(s). The fill equipment and airplane system concept are shown in figure 29. The sensor(s) make\nsure that the pump would not operate when water does not meet the purity requirements.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n24\n\nFigure 28.\xe2\x80\x94Airplane is serviced with demineralized water.\n\nFigure 29.\xe2\x80\x94Water-injection tank refill system was preliminarily designed and tested.\nAnother device that helps assure the airplane is not filled with tap water is to construct a special water\nfill nozzle as shown in figure 30. This fill nozzle should be constructed with a unique quick-disconnecttype feature to facilitate quick servicing while also assuring no other type of water nozzle could be\naccidentally attached.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n25\n\nFigure 30.\xe2\x80\x94Water refill nozzle needs to be specialized to\nprevent system from being filled with tap water.\n\nFigure 31.\xe2\x80\x94Water-injection system purity sensor prevents contaminated water from entering system.\nThe water refill system also contains a water contamination sensor(s) to make sure water quality\nmeets the minimum specification that will be discussed in section 3.3.3. These sensors are commercially\navailable devices that register changes in electrical resistance with water purity, as shown in figure 31.\nAs discussed in section 3.4.9, some airports are so traffic constrained that they could not tolerate\nadditional traffic operations on the ramp to refill the airplane via a water service truck. In these instances,\na dedicated water supply hose would be provided at each terminal gate. A central conditioning unit could\nthen supply demineralized water throughout the airport at each gate, where the refill hose would still have\nthe special quick-disconnect fitting.\nA water refill system, as shown in figure 29, was constructed and tested, outside of this contract, with\nvarious purity levels of water. Appendix B shows more detail on this work.\n3.2.7 Strut.\xe2\x80\x94The strut, or engine pylon, is the structure that attaches the engine to the wing. It also\nserves as a conduit for the many tubes and wires that run between the engine and airframe. The waterinjection system\xe2\x80\x99s tubes and wires also need to transition through the strut. The largest item for the waterinjection system is a 1.25-in. OD water delivery pipe. For a new airplane, this pipe could be designed\nrelatively easily into the new strut. However, for a retrofit or current production airplane, it would need to\nfit around the existing hardware. This will be challenging but most likely possible.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n26\n\nThe largest items running through the strut are the bleed ducts (fig. 32) that carry compressed air from\nthe compressor to the Environmental Control System and wing anti-ice systems.\nOther tubing that runs through the strut are the fuel feed line, the hydraulic supply lines, and the fire\nextinguishing lines as shown figure 33.\n\nFigure 32.\xe2\x80\x94Bleed ducts are the largest pipes contained in the engine strut.\n\nFigure 33.\xe2\x80\x94Routing a 1.25-in. OD water supply tube through strut\ncould be challenging as there are already many tubes.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n27\n\nFigure 34.\xe2\x80\x94Electrical lines also take up room in the strut and make\na water-injection line installation more difficult.\nLastly, there are several relatively large diameter wires running from the IDG to the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s\nelectrical bus (fig. 34). For a retrofit or current production airplane scenario, the single 1.25-in. OD waterinjection tube would either have to be routed around all of these existing items, or they will have to be\nmoved to a new location. This could become especially problematic and expensive for the retrofit case\nsince it would require more engineering design effort and also replacement of perfectly good tubing lines\nand wires that are in service.\nThe best case for water-injection installation in the strut is for a completely new airplane design so\nthat no existing systems would have to be reengineered.\n3.3 Engine System Design\n\nThere are several methods of introducing water into gas turbine engines, but the two that were studied\nfor this report were direct combustor water injection and atomization of water in front of the low-pressure\ncompressor, or water misting. From a previous study (ref. 1), these two methods appeared to offer the best\nperformance options. The combustor-injection system was focused upon due to fewer associated issues\nwith compressor surge margin deterioration, as will be discussed in section 3.4.\n3.3.1 Compressor Injection (Water Misting) System Design.\xe2\x80\x94This type of system consisted of\ninjecting finely atomized (i.e., 5 to 10 \xc2\xb5m) water droplets into the inlet of the LPC, and possibly into the\nHPC as shown in figure 35. It was assumed that this system would have the same design layout as\naeroderivative industrial gas turbine engines. As some of these engines are limited by the compressor\ndischarge temperature in lieu of the turbine inlet temperature, the water misting system can allow for\nmoderate increases in power (e.g., 12 percent) at standard day conditions and more (e.g., 30 percent)\non a 90 \xc2\xb0F day.\nHigh-pressure air is bled off of the HPC to assist in atomizing the water in the many water-injection\nnozzles. This HPC air reduces the level of water pressure needed to atomize the water and therefore\nreduces the level of electrical power needed to drive the water pumps.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n28\n\nFigure 35.\xe2\x80\x94Water misting concept that would spray atomized\nwater in front of the low-pressure compressor.\n\nFigure 36.\xe2\x80\x94Water droplet size needs to be sufficiently small to avoid being\ncentrifuged to the outside of the engine case (ref. 4).\nIt is important that the injected water droplets are sufficiently atomized to avoid their being\ncentrifuged to the outside of the compressor and impacting on the engine compressor case. Figure 36\nshows an analysis that predicts water droplets larger than 25 \xc2\xb5m diameter will be thrown outwards\ntowards the engine case (ref. 4). Here they will produce the same effects as the older water-injection\nsystems used on the original 747s\xe2\x80\x94the engine case will thermally distort and will also cause blade tip\nclearance problems.\nAnother important factor for the water misting system is that the atomized water droplets need to be\nintroduced sufficiently far upstream of the LPC to allow them to evaporate. The larger the water droplet,\nthe longer it will take to evaporate. Figure 37 shows that a 5-\xc2\xb5m-diameter water droplet will completely\nevaporate within 17 in. of entering the LPC. Large droplets take significantly longer.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n29\n\nFigure 37.\xe2\x80\x94Larger droplets, or those very close to the LPC, do not evaporate completely.\nThe evaporating water droplets will cool the compressor inlet air. This cooling effect can result in an\nengine performance improvement. The performance improvement is similar between operating an engine\non a hot day versus a cool day. When a 2.2 percent water-to-air (engine core) injection ratio is achieved\non a 69 \xc2\xb0F day, a 3.51 percent improvement in SFC is predicted (ref. 1).\nThe previous water injection feasibility study (ref. 1) reported that this system could deliver larger\nturbine inlet temperature reductions than the combustor injection system. This is because of the larger\namount of water required (480 gal for 50 percent NOx reduction versus 400 gal for 80 percent NOx\nreduction on water injection) a slightly improved SFC, and more derived thrust. This study will validate\nthose results in section 3.4 and report on findings from Pratt & Whitney.\nAs high turbine inlet temperatures (T41), usually associated with high ambient temperature\nconditions, clearly result in more frequent hot-section repair intervals. This water-misting system was\noriginally the favored option at the start of this study. However, as will be seen in section 3.4.4, the\nmodeled loss of compressor surge margin with this system (fig. 56), and the high weight of the larger\namount of carried water shifted the focus of the study to the combustor injection scheme described below.\nA detailed system design was therefore not carried out.\n3.3.2 Combustor Injection System Design.\xe2\x80\x94This method routes high-pressure water through a\ndistribution manifold that runs around the engine case and then into several dual water/fuel nozzles that\nspray the conditioned water directly into the combustion chamber.\nFigure 38 illustrates a concept that is typically used in industrial gas turbine engines. This method\neliminates the water distribution problems that were seen in the earlier water-injection systems used on\nBoeing 747 aircraft engines. Namely, water, or the water-cooled air, will neither impinge on the engine\ncase nor run down the combustor walls to cause combustor thermal stressing. When properly atomized by\nthe fuel nozzle, the water will not contribute to the same pattern factor problems associated with earlier\nengines.\nThere are several different design types of water-injection nozzles in use. A common theme is to\nintegrate the water passage along side the fuel passage in the feed stem. Some nozzles eject water directly\nthrough plane orifices located in the tip of the fuel nozzle spray head, while others may spray water into\nthe nozzle swirl vanes as shown in figure 39.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n30\n\nFigure 38.\xe2\x80\x94Concept showing the new industrial water-injection system\nthat sprays water directly into combustor to avoid previous problems.\n\nFigure 39.\xe2\x80\x94Some water-injection nozzle spray\nwater into the swirl vanes (ref. 5).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n31\n\nWhen water is sprayed into an engine, and the power setting is held constant, the flame temperature in\nthe combustor decreases. Figures 40 and 41 show the effect water injection has on flame temperature in a\nCFD model and an actual test rig of an experimental trapped vortex combustor (TVC) at the Air Force\nResearch Laboratory (ref. 6). The pictures on the left of both figures show the baseline TVC. They\nillustrate the high luminescence and corresponding high thermal radiative loads of a combustor operating\nunder simulated engine conditions. The photographs on the right show the same combustor operating with\na water-to-fuel injection ratio of 1:1. The photograph in figure 41 gives one the visual clue that a large\nreduction in thermal radiative loading has been achieved. It also shows downstream in the combustor\nthroat, that the flame has not been extinguished, but has simply been turned into the blue flame that is so\nsought after by combustion engineers.\n\nFigure 40.\xe2\x80\x94CFD models of a trapped vortex combustor (TVC) showing\nflame temperature effects of a 1:1 water-to-fuel injection ratio.\n\nFigure 41.\xe2\x80\x94TVC tests showing high-temperature baseline (left)\nand cooler 1:1 water-to-fuel injected combustor (right).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n32\n\nTwo water-injection system design approaches are presented: one from Pratt & Whitney and one\nfrom Rolls-Royce plc.\n3.3.2.1 Pratt & Whitney System Design: Pratt & Whitney was under contract to NASA to provide a\nwater-injection design and performance estimates to Boeing (ref. 7).\nThe Pratt & Whitney water-injection design used a dual fuel/water nozzle, somewhat similar to what\nwas presented in figure 38 except that the water was mixed with the fuel prior to the nozzle and the\ncombined mixture then flows through a common feed line which is then sprayed through a common\norifice into the engine combustor.\nThere may be some problems with such a system (e.g., fuel nozzle is not optimized for fuel use only)\nfor aircraft, but it represents a good starting point for this study as Pratt & Whitney has experience with\nthis system for industrial gas turbine engines.\nFigure 42 illustrates a Pratt & Whitney concept of the design for the water-injection system used for\nthe study. However, it also includes a natural gas and steam injection circuit that was not considered for\nthis aeroengine application.\nOne way that Pratt & Whitney overcame the design shortfall of this system was to optimize the\nnozzle for fuel flow only. When adding water during takeoff (doubles the total flow through the nozzle),\nthe fuel pressure would then be increased in order to overcome flow resistance and allow the same\namount of fuel to flow through the nozzle with the added water.\n\nFigure 42.\xe2\x80\x94Pratt & Whitney water-injection system concept.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n33\n\nA drawback to the added fuel pressure approach is that the fuel system then suffers a weight and cost\npenalty by increasing the fuel system pressure during water injection. As this weight penalty could about\ndouble the engine system weight, our study assumed that another method could be found to solve this\nweight penalty (such as the Rolls-Royce system shown in fig. 39). Pratt & Whitney quoted an engine\nweight estimate of 16.1 to 31.9 lb per engine for the water-injection system alone. The fuel pressure\npenalty would add 21.0 to 29.6 lb more per engine. As will be shown in section 3.4.1 we used 31.9 lb\nper engine for the airplane weight assessment.\nAs water injection can supply 10 to 30 percent more thrust, a control logic algorithm needs to be\nimplemented within the engine digital electronic controller to tell the engine that the water-injection\nsystem is indeed operating and to adjust the fuel flow schedules accordingly.\n3.2.2.2 Rolls-Royce System Design: Rolls-Royce plc also provided design concepts for an aircraft\nwater-injection system. They first assessed where to mount the water pump and how to drive it. The\nfollowing three designs were considered: (1) an air turbine water pump, (2) a case-mounted water pump,\nand (3) an airframe mounted pump, which are now discussed.\nThe conceptual design of an air-turbine-driven water pump system is similar to what is used on the\nPegasus engine for the Harrier military aircraft (fig. 1). In this configuration, high-pressure air is bled off\nthe engine compressor and fed to a pneumatic motor, which is attached to the water pump. In this\nconfiguration (fig. 43), the HPC bleed air is taken from the anti-icing system for the engine nacelle. This\nair is fed through a pneumatic control valve, located on the engine core, to the air turbine water pump. A\nlow-pressure water boost pump is located on the water tanks in the airframe. This supplies water at about\n30 psig to the high-pressure air turbine pump. The water is then pressurized to about 800 psig in the pump\nand fed to a water distribution manifold where it will be injected through a dual water/fuel nozzle, similar\nto what was presented in section 3.3.2.\nThe benefits of such a system are that no electrical supply limits for the pump motor will be\nencountered. This system also has the potential for being quite lightweight as pneumatic motors can be\nsubstantially lighter weight than electrical motors. The water feed lines from the tank to the engine can\nalso be made lighter weight since they are operating at a lower pressure.\n\nFigure 43.\xe2\x80\x94An air-turbine-powered water pump for\nwater injection was the first option studied.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n34\n\nThe disadvantages are that the high-pressure bleed lines would need to be redesigned. In addition, the\nair exhaust from the pneumatic motor would need to be routed into the fan bypass duct. It is uncertain\nhow this might affect the operation of the engine fan. Also, these types of pneumatic motors tend to be\nquite noisy, so the exhaust would most likely need to be muffled or the takeoff noise level of the entire\naircraft might increase.\nAnother option would be to mount the water pump directly onto the engine\xe2\x80\x99s gearbox as shown in\nfigure 44. This would eliminate the air exhaust noise problems and the need to redesign the bleed system.\nIn this configuration, the water line would need to be routed around the engine fan to the pump,\nwhich would be located on the accessory gearbox, also on the fan case. From there, the water line would\nbe fed through the lower bifurcated duct panel up to the water distribution manifold.\nThis design approach also presents challenges. Namely, it could only be used on a newly designed\nengine as there are no current spare pads on the accessory gearbox to mount the water pump. In addition,\nthe 1-in.-diameter pipe would be difficult to feed through the lower bifurcated duct passage. Lastly, the\npump would either need to be disconnected via a heavy clutch mechanism, or be run continuously.\nThe last configuration involved mounting the water pump on the airframe and feeding the highpressure water to the engine. As shown in figure 45, this is the simplest system for the engine. A 1-in.diameter pipe (1.25 in. diam would have less pressure drop and was used on the airframe side) is fed\nthrough the strut to the engine core where it is attached to the water-distribution manifold. The water flow\ncontrol valve would be located in the strut or wing and controlled via the engine electronic control\nmodule. The control module would gradually introduce water to the engine to avoid thermally shocking\nthe engine hot section. There would also be a drain valve and drain line (not shown) that is connected to\nthe water manifold, which runs down through the bifurcated duct panel and out the bottom of the engine.\nFor this configuration, there would be minimal changes to the engine and no issues are envisioned.\nThus, of the three configurations studied for the Rolls-Royce water-injection system, the airframe\nmounted water pump was chosen as the preferred configuration.\n\nFigure 44.\xe2\x80\x94A case-mounted water pump for water injection\nwas the second option studied for one engine.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n35\n\nFigure 45.\xe2\x80\x94An airframe-mounted water pump\nwas the third option considered.\n3.3.3 Water Purity Requirements.\xe2\x80\x94In order to avoid damage to the engine hot section, demineralized\nwater must be used in the water-injection system. The level of required water purity varies between\nengine manufacturer, and is listed for Rolls-Royce industrial gas turbine engines in table VI.\nTABLE VI.\xe2\x80\x94WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR WATER-INJECTED ENGINES\nThe sample of fluid must be obtained using ASTM method D.3370 for water.\nThe water must be clear in appearance.\nThe quality of the water must generally conform to ASTM D.1193 type IIIA or IVA and have the following properties:\nParameter\n\nUnits\n\nR-R Specification\nLimits\n\nASTM Method\n\nOther Engine\n\nTotal matter\n\nppm max.\n\n2\n\nD.1888\n\n10\n\nDissolved matter\n\nppm max.\n\n0.5\n\nD.1888\n\n5\n\n6 to 8\n\nD.1428\n\n?\n\nD.1293\n\n0.1\n\npH value\nSodium and Potassium\n\nppm max.\n\n0.2\n\nSilica\n\nppm max.\n\n0.05\n\nD.859\n\n?\n\nTotal hardness\n\nepm max.\n\n0.2\n\nD.1126\n\n?\n\nmicroS/cm max.\n\n1\n\nD.1125\n\n?\n\n10 \xc2\xb5m\n\nN/A\n\n20 \xc2\xb5m\n\nF.60\n\n?\n\nConductivity at 25 \xc2\xb0C\nMax. particle size\nBiological contamination\n\nThe Rolls-Royce water quality requirements are significantly more stringent than for other waterinjected engines. The purity level listed for other engines is considered more easily attainable and can be\nachieved with relatively conventional equipment (ref. 8).\nAs the aeroengine will only use the conditioned water for less than 3 min and the industrial engines\nuse the water continuously, it remains to be seen if these types of quality requirements are needed for\naeroengines. If water injection were to be implemented, a trade study should be conducted to evaluate the\nimpact of lesser quality water on engine durability versus the cost of conditioning the water.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n36\n\n3.4 Performance Summary\n\nThe water-injection system will affect the performance of the airplane and the engines. The waterinjection system will add weight, increased power demands and complexity to the airframe, which will\nhave an adverse impact. The same is true for the engines, except that water injection will have a greater\nimpact on their operation\xe2\x80\x94some adverse and some beneficial.\n3.4.1 Weights.\xe2\x80\x94By their vary nature, airplanes are very sensitive to weight. When adding the waterinjection system to the airplane, even when it is empty of water, the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s payload capability and\nrange will decrease. On a retrofit case, this payload loss will be compensated for by reducing the number\nof passengers carried. For a newly designed airplane, the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s payload carrying capability would\nneed to be increased. Therefore, in either case, weight will be a critical issue to address.\nThe weight estimates for the water-injection system were broken down into airframe and engine\ncomponents. In any of the installation concepts studied for the combustor water-injection method, the\nweight remained relatively unchanged for each of the systems.\nTable VII shows the estimated weight breakdown for the airframe portion of the water-injection\nsystem. For all of the components, except the tanks, these weights were derived from the traditional\n747\xe2\x80\x93200 water-injection system. The tubing weight was increased as the previous aluminum tubes were\nreplaced with CRES. However, the weight of this part of the system climbed precipitously. Therefore, the\nCRES tubing was replaced with titanium tubing, saving approximately 115 lb. This tubing weight\nvariable includes fittings, mounting brackets, and special flex couplings in the wing, which explains the\nrelatively high fraction of system weight.\nAs the previous water tank on the 747\xe2\x80\x93200 was integral to the wing and the newly designed tank was\nplaced below the cargo hold, the new water tank weight was estimated from composite construction\nguidelines.\nThe total weight of the airframe portion of the water-injection system was estimated to be 620 lb,\nwhich is heavier than the heritage water-injection system due to the improved design features just\nmentioned. Further improvements to this weight would be difficult to achieve.\nTABLE VII.\xe2\x80\x94WEIGHTS BREAKDOWN FOR AIRFRAME PORTION\nOF WATER-INJECTION SYSTEM ON A BOEING 747\nPart\n\nWeight\n(lb)\n\nPumps (four)\n\n110\n\nTanks and mounting\n\n175\n\nService panel\n\n10\n\nTi plumbing\n\n210*\n\nValves, etc.\n\n40\n\nWiring\n\n75\n\nTotal airframe\n\n620\n\n* For SS tubing, add 115 lb\n\nThe water-injection system weights for the engine were supplied by Pratt & Whitney and modified by\nBoeing to account for an anticipated different architecture. As discussed in the Pratt &Whitney system\ndescription, that particular method of injecting water into the combustor employed a fuel pressure boost\nsystem. This significantly added to the engine system weight. As other engine manufacturers have\neliminated this weight penalty by designing the system slightly different, this present study assumed\nthe 21 lb per engine weight penalty would be able to be eliminated once the aeroengine system was\noptimized.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n37\n\nTable VIII shows the weight breakdown for each engine.

This consisted of the 620-lb airframe weight\nand 31.9 lb for each engine, or 127.6 lb for all engines.\nThis amount of weight increase is a serious issue and will no doubt be met with strong objections\nfrom the engineering community. However, one approach to address this (for newly designed airplanes\nanyway) would be to slightly increase the payload capability of the airplane in the design phase. For\nretrofit applications, this is not possible, therefore, the payload loss issue will need to be addressed with\nthe airline operators.\n3.4.2 Structures.\xe2\x80\x94There are several structural design issues with the system that will need to be\naddressed. As shown in figure 46, these have to do with the water tanks and water lines.\n\nFigure 46.\xe2\x80\x94Several structural requirements need to be addressed.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n38\n\nThe heritage water-injection system had the water tanks located in the unpressurized part of the\naircraft and, therefore, did not have to deal with pressure differentials within the tanks. As the new tanks\nare located inside the aircraft pressure vessel (to eliminate freezing problems) and the water lines need to\nbe drained to atmospheric pressure, the tanks could collapse if the drain lines equalized the internal tank\npressure to ambient. Therefore, either the tanks need to be constructed to withstand that type of pressure\ndifferential, or the drain and vent lines need to have shutoff valves installed to the outside and the tanks\nvented to the cabin pressure.\nAnother tank design issue that needs to be addressed is the ease with which they can be removed for\nairplane inspection. Namely, the airframe is periodically inspected for corrosions, cracks, etc., and the\ntanks would need to be removed to gain access to the bilge area of the aircraft.\nThe water tanks and fill lines need to be designed such that they can be completely drained of water\nas they could still be subjected to freezing conditions. For example, the aircraft could be serviced with\nwater and the flight then cancelled in freezing conditions. If the cargo hold door were to be left open, the\nwater in the tanks and fill lines could then freeze. As 400 gal is a sizeable amount of water, it could not be\ndrained through the heated drain mast onto the airport apron, but would need to be offloaded via the water\nservice truck.\nSimilarly, the pressurized water lines need to be drained after each use as they run through unheated\nparts of the airplane. The draining may be done via a gravity-feed-type system that utilizes antisiphon\nvalves, or it could be done via high-pressure bleed air being introduced into the water supply lines to blow\nthe water out through drain lines.\nOn larger airplanes, the wings can flex up and down enough that means must be made to allow the\nwater supply tubing to also flex. Previously, this was done by flexible couplings on the tubing that was\ninstalled inside of the wing leading edge.\nNone of these issues are serious and can be addressed with good engineering prowess.\n3.4.3 Testing Requirements.\xe2\x80\x94The water-injection system will need to be tested for functionality,\noperational durability, and certification requirements as shown in figure 47.\n\nFigure 47.\xe2\x80\x94Airframe and engine water-injection systems\nboth will need to be tested and certified.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n39\n\nFor the certification tests, the airplane system will need to demonstrate operability and performance\nunder simulated and actual conditions that the airplane will encounter. Some of the items that need to be\naddressed in the testing are the system must respond accurately during engine transient throttle changes,\ncontrol of the water-injection rate meets requirements, the tank water quantity indication system\naccurately measures the water, and the water delivery system continues to be operational under various\nairplane attitudes.\nThe water tanks will need to undergo specific testing to validate its integrity and that the air pressures\nthroughout the system are as expected so that the structural integrity of the tank is not breached.\nThe engine will also need to undergo operational tests to assure stable operation, especially during\nwet conditions and therefore will have to be subjected to a water-ingestion test when using water\ninjection.\nFor a new airplane design, these tests will add some cost to the overall program as there would be an\nincreased amount of work added to the already planned airplane tests. However, for a water-injection\nretrofit scenario, or adding water injection as an option to a current production airplane, these tests would\nadd significant nonrecurring costs. This is because the tests would need to be conducted solely for the\nwater-injection system and therefore would not share the testing costs with the airplane development\nprogram.\n3.4.4 Engine Performance Impact for Water Injection.\xe2\x80\x94Injecting water into the combustor showed\nless of an impact on compressor surge margin than water misting and yet achieved a worthwhile 120 \xc2\xb0F\nreduction in turbine inlet temperature. A 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio was selected as the optimal ratio to reduce\nNOx 80 percent and still maintain combustor stability. While holding a constant takeoff thrust, figure 48\nillustrates the modeled results of water injection. As the water flow rate is increased, the engine spool\nspeeds (N1 and N2), the compressor exit temperature (T3), and turbine inlet temperature (T4) all\ndecrease.\n\nFigure 48.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection directly into the combustor was\nmodeled to provide a 120 \xc2\xb0F reduction in T4.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n40\n\nFigure 49.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection resulted in LPC and HPC surge\nmargin losses of 0.4 and 1.6 percent, respectively.\n\nFigure 50.\xe2\x80\x94A turbine rematch would be required with water injection to correct\nfor compressor surge and would result in a 0.4 percent SFC penalty for a retrofit engine.\nThe LPC and HPC showed less deterioration in surge margin than for LPC water misting. Figure 49\nshows that at the optimal 1:1 water-to-fuel injection ratio, the LPC loses 0.4 percent in surge margin\nwhile the HPC loses 1.6 percent.\nFor some types of engines, this level of deterioration can be tolerated without further intervention.\nHowever, for other engines that are more sensitive to compressor surge, some action will need to be taken\nto resolve the issue.\nTo compensate for the loss in surge margin for the PW4062 engine, the high-pressure turbine would\nneed to be opened up to rematch the new compressor flow rate with water injection. However, figure 50\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n41\n\nshows that so doing will result in a 0.4 percent SFC penalty. For long-range airplanes that are very\nsensitive to engine fuel efficiency, this level of efficiency would be quite onerous.\nHowever, for a new engine that is specifically designed around water injection, this penalty may be\neliminated. This again suggests that water injection would be best suited for newly designed airplanes and\nretrofit options are less suitable.\nThe EGT coming out of the engine\xe2\x80\x99s turbine is typically also used to control the operation of the\nengine. As the parts of a gas turbine engine wear and the performance begins to deteriorate, the EGT\nincreases. Therefore, an upper limit is set for each engine at which time the engine must be overhauled to\navoid over-temperature situations, which would damage the turbine blades. The difference between\noperating temperature and the limit is referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cEGT margin.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFigure 51 shows that when water injection is used during takeoff (for the PW4062 engine with\nrematched turbine), a 25 \xc2\xb0F decrease in EGT is achieved, which will increase the EGT margin. This\nmeans that the engine can be operated for a longer period of time before overhaul, which could be of\nsubstantial savings for an airline operator. However, once the normal EGT margin is reached, the waterinjection system would lose its \xe2\x80\x9coptional use\xe2\x80\x9d status and need to be operated at each takeoff to avoid\nturbine over temperature conditions. As this study considered the use of water injection as an option to the\noperator (to avoid any potential safety issues with a flight critical system), the cost benefits of the\nincreased EGT margin were not considered in this study.\nAs the water tends to slightly quench the flame temperature in the combustor, there is an\naccompanying loss in thermal efficiency of the engine when water injection is used during takeoff.\nFigure 52 shows that during takeoff, there is a 1.2 percent increase in fuel consumption when water\ninjection is used.\nThis thermal efficiency loss is reflected in the decrease in combustor exit temperature. This\ntemperature is shown in figure 53 and is slightly higher than T41 turbine inlet temperature for the takeoff\nprofile of the 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER aircraft. During takeoff and climbout, the combustor exit temperature (CET) is\nabout 135 \xc2\xb0F cooler when water injection is used. At the point where water injection is discontinued,\nabout 4 n mi from takeoff roll, the CET returns to temperatures that are almost the same as the baseline\nPW4062 engine. It is a few degrees cooler at this point due to the turbine rematch that was required to\ncorrect the compressor surge margin issue.\n\nFigure 51.\xe2\x80\x94EGT decreases 25 \xc2\xb0F with water injection.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n42\n\nFigure 52.\xe2\x80\x94SFC increases 1.2 percent during takeoff when water injection is used.\n\nFigure 53.\xe2\x80\x94CET decreases 135 \xc2\xb0F when water injection is used.\n\nOne of the benefits of decreasing combustor exit and turbine inlet temperatures is that it can improve\nthe life of the engine hot section. When looking at the normal T41 temperature profile from takeoff to\nclimb in figure 54, one can see from the top solid line that the turbine is exposed to its peak temperature\nduring the 90 sec takeoff and climbout phase of flight, which takes the airplane to about 2 n mi from\ntakeoff roll.\nThe bottom dashed line shows the T41 profile of an engine with 1:1 water-to-fuel injection rate. Once\nthe aircraft reaches 3000 ft altitude (about 4 n mi) the water-injection system is turned off and the T41\ntemperature returns to normal. Thus, using water injection during the takeoff roll and climbout will\nreduce the most life-demanding peak temperature level to about that of normal climb condition.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n43\n\nFigure 54.\xe2\x80\x94Using water injection cuts peak blade temperature\nright were it is needed most\xe2\x80\x94during takeoff.\n3.4.5 Engine Performance Impact for Water Misting.\xe2\x80\x94Due to the more-limited industrial engine\nexperience with misting water into the LPC, there was higher uncertainty of how water misting would\naffect the aeroengine\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\nTwo of the most important parameters needing to be addressed were to validate the degree of T4\nreduction estimated from the earlier modeled results (ref. 1) and to address the issue of possible\ncompressor surge margin deterioration.\nA ratio of 0.022:1 water-to-core airflow ratio was modeled by NASA in the earlier study for another\nengine model, which predicted a 436 \xc2\xb0R reduction in T4 and 47 percent NOx reduction. For this study the\nPratt & Whitney PW4062 engine model predicted a 410 \xc2\xb0R reduction in T4 with similar water flows.\nFigure 55 shows the T41 reduction as a function of water misting rate and also shows the effect on rpm\nfor the first engine spool (N1), the second engine spool (N2), and the compressor exit temperatures (T3).\nAll of the variables decline when the water-injection rate is increased.\nAs some engines reach maximum temperature limits from T3 and T41 reductions result in higher\nturbine life, these dramatic reduction levels are very desirable to achieve. Reductions in N1 and N2 with\nwater misting would also allow for increased thrust from those engines that are \xe2\x80\x9cred line\xe2\x80\x9d speed limited.\nThus, this chart shows all positive results.\nWhen water is misted into the inlet of a compressor, the total mass flow through it increases.\nChanging the mass flow, without changing other operating conditions, can lead to operating difficulties.\nAt any given rotational speed, an engine compressor is designed to produce a certain airflow rate,\nwhich will then achieve a certain pressure rise in the engine. The engine controller senses, among other\nthings, pressure rise from the compressor and uses this to regulate the amount of fuel flowing into the\ncombustor based on the assumption that this pressure rise is related to a particular flow rate.\nIf a certain compressor output pressure is being maintained, and water is added to the airstream, the\ntotal mass flow increases. As the engine was not designed to use this added mass flow, the air and water\n(in effect) starts to back up inside the compressor and will reach a point where the compressor will surge,\nmeaning the airflow will start to reverse direction.\nThe difference between the surge point and the operating point is called the \xe2\x80\x9csurge margin.\xe2\x80\x9d Adding\nwater to the inlet of the LPC decreases surge margin. If the water is completely evaporated prior to it\nentering the compressor, figure 56 shows the modeled surge margin deterioration for LPC and HPC.\nWhen adding water to the air in a 0.022:1.000 ratio, the surge margin on the LPC will deteriorate 9\npercent. Although a stationary turbine operating under stable conditions may be able to tolerate this kind\nof deterioration, it was considered too high for aircraft operation. The HPC surge margin will deteriorate\n3 percent.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n44\n\nFigure 55.\xe2\x80\x94Water misting results in a 410 \xc2\xb0F reduction in T41.\n\nFigure 56.\xe2\x80\x94Water misting results in an unacceptable\n9 percent loss in LPC surge margin.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n45\n\nCombustor Water\nInjection\nWater use\n(for 50% NOx reduction)\n\nNOx reduction\n\nWater\nMisting\n\n\xe2\x88\x9a Uses half the water\n\xe2\x88\x9a Capability to 90 percent\n\nT3 affect\n\n\xe2\x88\x9a Reduced\n\nT4 reduction\n\n\xe2\x88\x9a Larger reduction\n\xe2\x88\x9a Improved\n\nSFC impact\nSurge issues\n\n\xe2\x88\x9a Much less impact\n\xe2\x88\x9a Less noise\n\nNoise\n\xe2\x88\x9a Less risk\n\nRisk\n\nFigure 57.\xe2\x80\x94Combustor water injection was\nchosen as the system to focus on.\nDue to the high surge margin deterioration level modeled for the LPC, the following combustor\nwater-injection system was deemed a more likely candidate. Figure 57 shows the pros and cons between\nthe two systems and why the water-injection system was chosen to be focused on.\n3.4.6 Turbine Life.\xe2\x80\x94The turbine life impact of using water injection is probably the most critical\nfinding of this study as it affects airplane operating cost, which will most likely be the determining factor\nin the market implementation success of water-injection technology. For most airplane operators, a\nreduction of NOx emissions will be a secondary concern.\nThe exact methodology of determining turbine life is proprietary to the engine companies. In\naddition, turbine life impact is expected to vary between engine companies, engine models, operating\nmanner, and ambient weather conditions. However, the calculated end results of using water injection will\nbe presented from two manufacturers. In addition, turbine life trends will be discussed in an attempt to\nunderstand the basis of these life estimates.\nDepending on the amount of water injected, the airplane operating conditions encountered, and the\nsusceptibility of the turbine blade metal to temperature, the most severe life-limiting part of the blade\xe2\x80\x99s\nlife (takeoff) can be controlled.\n3.4.6.1 Turbine Life Design and Operating Issues: The hot section part of an engine consists of the\ncombustor and high-pressure turbine assembly. Due to the high temperatures, pressures, and rotational\nspeeds of the components in these areas, the hot section is typically exposed to a harsher environment\nthan the rest of the engine. These components can have a significantly lower service life than the rest of\nthe engine (ref. 9) as illustrated in figure 58.\nIt is difficult to determine a fatigue limit or a stress at high temperatures below that no failures will\noccur (ref. 10), although table IX illustrates the design practices, and service life experience, of a\nrelatively modern (i.e., 1980s vintage) turbine engine that is still in use today (ref. 11). The highest T41\ntemperature occurs during the 90 sec takeoff period. On a standard day, about 36 percent of the turbine\nblade\xe2\x80\x99s life is consumed during this short period of time. In total, the operating time at takeoff amounts to\nabout 300 hr (<2 percent) of the turbine\xe2\x80\x99s 18 000-hr design life.\nTABLE IX.\xe2\x80\x9436 PERCENT OF A HP TURBINE IS\nCONSUMED DURING THE SHORT TAKEOFF PERIOD\nCondition\nTakeoff\nMax. climb\nMax. cruise\nBalance\nTotal\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\nLife used,\npercent\n36\n49\n15\n< 0.1\n100\n\n46\n\nTime,\nhr\n300\n3 300\n7 200\n7 200\n18 000\n\nFigure 58.\xe2\x80\x94Hot section design life is often shorter than the rest of the engine\ndue to the challenging high temperature environment.\n\nFigure 59.\xe2\x80\x94Reducing operating temperature can significantly increase aeroengine turbine blade life.\nBy reducing T41 temperatures during takeoff, turbine life will typically increase. Section 3.4.5\nshowed that using water injection during takeoff would reduce the peak turbine inlet temperature\napproximately 120 \xc2\xb0R for the combustor water-injection case. To understand the significance of this\ntemperature reduction, the following discussion is offered to show examples of how peak temperatures\nadversely affect turbine blade life.\nTurbine blade life decreases rapidly with increases in temperature. On a 1980s vintage example\nengine, an engine operator would only achieve an 833-hr turbine blade life if the engine was operated\ncontinuously at takeoff conditions (ref. 11). Using the turbine blade life data for each operating point\nprovided in table IX, and corresponding T41 data that were calculated from Boeing engine performance\nmodels under standard day conditions, figure 59 was created for illustration purposes only. It shows\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n47\n\nthat there is a logarithmic relationship between T41 temperatures and turbine blade life. From this\nillustration, it was estimated that turbine blade life could increase approximately 7500 additional hours\nfrom the 833 hr at takeoff, if water injection was used to reduce the operating temperature 120 \xc2\xb0R\xe2\x80\x94a\n10-fold improvement in turbine life at continuous takeoff conditions.\nBased on the above sample engine (used for illustration purposes only), the life extension during\ntakeoff would reallocate the percent of turbine life used at each operating point. For example, simple\ncalculation results are shown in figure 60 that suggest the turbine design life might increase from 18 000\nto 26 233 hr\xe2\x80\x94an estimated 46 percent increase in design life.\nThe effect of using water injection and its corresponding reduction in T41 is now compared to\noperating the engine in different ambient conditions without water injection. Figure 61 shows how T41\nvaries with changes in ambient temperature conditions for a similar aero gas turbine engine. For constant\nthrust conditions, as ambient temperature increases, there is a much larger increase in T41. Similarly, T41\ndecreases linearly when the ambient temperature drops below the 60 \xc2\xb0F reference condition.\nFor the case of using water injection on a 60 \xc2\xb0F day and the resulting 120 \xc2\xb0F reduction in T41\xe2\x80\x94this\nis equivalent to operating the engine without water injection on a day that is 28 \xc2\xb0F cooler than 60 \xc2\xb0F\n(i.e., 32 \xc2\xb0F).\nBase engine\n\nWater injected engine*\n\nLife used\n(%)\n\nTotal\ntime\n\nLife used\n(%)\n\nTotal\ntime\n\nTakeoff\n\n36\n\n300\n\n3\n\n437\n\nMax. climb\n\n49\n\n3,300\n\n71\n\n4,809\n\nMax. cruise\n\n15\n\n7,200\n\n22\n\n10,493\n\nBalance\n\nNil\n\n7,200\n\n2\n\n10,493\n\nTotal\n\n100\n\n18,000\n\n100\n\n26,233\n\n*ROM estimate\n\nFigure 60.\xe2\x80\x94Using water injection during takeoff could reallocate\nthe percent of turbine life used at each operating point.\n\nFigure 61.\xe2\x80\x94The 120 \xc2\xb0F reduction in T4 achieved when using water injection on\na 60 \xc2\xb0F day, is equivalent to reducing the ambient temperature 28 \xc2\xb0F.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n48\n\n3.4.6.2 Turbine Life Trends: The potential life benefit analysis presented here focuses specifically on\nturbine blade life assuming that turbine life is primarily limited by blade life. The dominant mechanisms\nof failure in the turbine are identified as low-cycle fatigue, creep, and oxidation. Owing to the complexity\nof the interactions between these failure mechanisms and the lack of detailed knowledge about the loads\nand temperatures involved in the study engine, a high-fidelity life model is not feasible for this study.\nConsequently, a fatigue life analysis using an empirical model is presented along with a brief overview of\nthe effects of creep and oxidation as found in the literature.\nUsing the Universal Slopes method (ref. 12), a preliminary quantitative analysis has been performed\nfor possible fatigue life benefits from water injection. The Universal Slopes Method is a modified version\nof the Coffin-Manson and Basquin equations with experimentally obtained coefficients and is given by\n\xcf\x83\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 total = 3.5 ult N \xe2\x88\x920.12 + \xce\xb5 0.6 N \xe2\x88\x920.6\nf\nf\nf\nE\n\n(1)\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1 \xe2\x8e\x9e\nwhere, \xce\xb5 f = ln (1 + % elongation ) , or \xce\xb5 f = ln\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9d 1 \xe2\x88\x92 RA \xe2\x8e\xa0\n\nNickel-based superalloys, Inconel 625, Inconel 706, and Rene 80 were used for this analysis (refs. 13\nto 15). The total strain was selected such that the respective stress level is limited from 40 to 80 percent of\nthe ultimate tensile strength at a given temperature level. This corresponds to applying a design factor of\nsafety of 2.5 to 1.25, respectively. The life cycles to failure were acquired from equation (1), varying\nstrain levels and material properties with temperature. Life ratios were obtained by dividing the cycles to\nfailure at each temperature and strain level by the cycles to failure at the maximum temperature and strain\nlevel. Figure 62 shows the results obtained for Inconel 625, Inconel 706, and Rene 80.\n\nFigure 62.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 706 and Rene 80 total life estimate.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n49\n\nThe overall trend noticed in figure 62 is that life benefits improve with decreasing temperature. In the\ncase of Inconel 706, the life ratio curve appears different from those of Inconel 625 and Rene 80. The\ndifferences in the life estimate behaviors of Inconel 706, Inconel 625, and Rene 80 primarily arise from\nvariations in material properties and strain levels used. Additionally, the range of temperatures used for\nInconel 706 is narrower than those used for the other materials, which puts limitations on the comparisons\npossible. It is seen that for a 120 \xc2\xb0F reduction in the turbine inlet gas and blade temperatures, life\nimproves by a factor of approximately 2 for Inconel 625, 1.65 for Inconel 706, and about 3.5 for Rene 80.\nAs noted from this comparison, an accurate estimate for life benefits can only be obtained with a detailed\nanalysis using the material properties, metal temperatures, and load levels involved in the specified engine\ntype.\nThere will also be differences in the life benefits possible depending on ambient operating conditions.\nThe magnitude of turbine life improvement will depend on the nominal operating metal temperature. As\nseen from figure 62, the slope of the fatigue life ratio curve changes depending on the temperature range\nconcerned and thus life benefits can be significantly higher at temperatures where the slope is steep as\ncompared to where the life curve flattens out.\nIn addition to the limitations arising from the lack of detailed data, there are also some notable\nshortcomings in the application of the Universal Slopes Method. The coefficients used in equation (1) are\nobtained through isothermal, room temperature fatigue tests done on a wide range of materials. As shown\nin the Manson report (ref. 12), these average coefficients provide fairly reliable life estimates for the 29\nmaterials tested with 99.5 percent of the experimental data falling within a factor of 20 of the predicted\nlife. However, life estimates obtained under thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) can vary significantly from\nthose obtained from isothermal low-cycle fatigue. Under in-service conditions, turbine blades are exposed\nto widely varying thermomechanical loads, and simplified isothermal models do not capture the\ncomplexity of the situation. The deviation of isothermal results from TMF results depends largely on the\nmaterial properties and the nature of the TMF cycle. The primary reason for the use of the Universal\nSlopes Method in this analysis was the ease involved in its use and availability of the necessary material\ndata. Despite its shortcomings, this method is a good tool for a preliminary design level analysis where\nthe overall trends in life behavior are sought.\nIn order to provide an estimate for creep and oxidation life benefits from water injection, we present\nsome relevant results available in the literature. Based on common industry practice (ref. 16),\napproximations for changes in the first stage turbine blade life resulting from changes in gas and metal\ntemperatures as well as centrifugal stresses are shown in table X.\nTABLE X.\xe2\x80\x94TURBINE BLADE LIFE ESTIMATE\nVARIATION WITH TEMPERATURE AND STRESS\nVariation\nLocal gas temperature\n\xc2\xb118 \xc2\xb0F (mean 3140 \xc2\xb0F)\nMetal temperature\n\xc2\xb15 \xc2\xb0F (mean 1340 \xc2\xb0F)\nCentrifugal stresses\n\xc2\xb11 percent\n\nFirst blade\ncreep-fatigue life\n\xc2\xb115 percent\n\nFirst blade\noxidation life\n\xc2\xb114 percent\n\n\xc2\xb18 percent\n\n\xc2\xb18 percent\n\n\xc2\xb16 percent\n\n---------------\n\nIt can be noted from table X that blade life estimates are sensitive to the gas and metal temperature as\nwell as stress levels used in the analysis. The combined effects of thermomechanical fatigue, creep, and\noxidation are usually studied experimentally and then modeled based on the data obtained. However,\nfrom the first-order analysis presented here, it is seen that there may be significant hot section life benefits\nresulting from water injection. In order to quantify these results with more confidence, detailed\nexperimental studies replicating the operating conditions under water injection on appropriate turbine\nblade materials are necessary.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n50\n\n\xce\x94T (\xc2\xb0F)\nPercent life improvement\nestimatea\n\nPratt & Whitney\n\xe2\x80\x93120\n\nRolls Royce\n\xe2\x80\x93120\n\n29 percentb\n\n0 to 20 percentc\n\nNotes:\na\n3 k n mi mission length, 1:1 water-to-fuel injection ratio\nb\nTurbine service life (1990s to 2000 technology PS4062 engine)\nc\nVaries dependent upon engine operating conditions\n\nFigure 63.\xe2\x80\x94There is agreement within the industry that water injection\nwill reduce T41 and improve turbine life but disagreement by how much.\n3.4.6.3 Estimates of Turbine Life From Engine Companies: The previous discussion estimated\ndesign life impacts on the turbine when using water injection. The following discussion includes\nestimates from engine companies who provided data of expected turbine in-service life impacts. This\nincludes experience-based models, which may explain the difference in turbine life estimates between\ndesign and in-service.\nThe Pratt & Whitney Engine Corporation supplied turbine blade life estimates to Boeing under\ncontract from NASA Glenn. A series of proprietary temperature adders were used in conjunction with the\noriginal performance parameters to determine the basis for the airfoil durability assessment.\nThese adders include performance-miss factors, engine-to-engine variation, speed power setting,\ntransient overshoot, and deterioration. Other design elements, such as pattern factor, profile factors,\nperformance-to-gas temperature ratios, relative-to-absolute temperature ratios, coolant-to-compressor\ndischarge temperature ratios, overall file and cooling effectiveness with and without thermal barrier\ncoatings were included in the durability analysis.\nThe analysis showed a 120 \xc2\xb0F T41 gas temperature decrease, which was predicted from the 1:1 waterto-fuel injection ratio. This resulted in a 78 \xc2\xb0F decrease in turbine blade metal temperature. Using the\nPratt & Whitney life assessment tools for thermal barrier coating spallation, or metallic and alloy\noxidation, an expected life improvement of 29 percent was achieved.\nAlthough Pratt & Whitney was the only engine company under NASA contract to supply turbine life\nestimates for water injection, other companies and organizations provided estimate ranges. The engine\ncompany-supplied data is shown in figure 63.\nRolls-Royce estimated the turbine life could potentially increase up to 20 percent for a newly\ndesigned engine that is operated in a hot climate. However, for cold-climate operation using thrust derate,\nthere could be no savings at all.\nAs mentioned above, the turbine life will vary depending on the operating conditions of the airplane.\nIn addition to this variability, the Pratt & Whitney analysis was performed assuming the engine was\noperated at full-power conditions under average-day conditions. Many flights are operated under some\nlevel of thrust derate. As thrust derate will improve the life of the turbine, water injection will have less of\na life benefit during these episodes.\nCombustor wall radiative heat loading should be reduced, which will reduce wall temperatures and\ncould therefore also increase combustor life. There could be other unforeseen impacts to the engine, such\nas turbine blade thermal barrier coating impacts, which needs to be resolved by testing and eventually by\nperforming engine endurance tests.\n3.4.7 Emissions.\xe2\x80\x94Some aircraft emission byproducts (CO2) are a direct result of the efficient\ncombustion of fossil fuels and are a direct function of airplane fuel efficiency. Other pollutant emissions\nare more related to the way fossil fuels are combusted. These regulated emissions are oxides of\nnitrogen\xe2\x80\x94collectively called NOx, hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke. Other\natmospheric emissions or byproducts of aircraft operation are contrails and ozone generation at cruise\nconditions (fig. 64).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n51\n\nAs water injection primarily affects engine combustion emissions, we focus on how those resultants\nare impacted.\nNOx generation is primarily a function of temperature; higher combustor flame temperatures lead to\nhigher NOx emissions (ref. 17) and are illustrated in figure 65. Many years ago, water injection was\nshown to be highly effective in reducing smoke as well as NOx emissions (ref. 18). It has since been used\nin many industrial aeroderivative gas turbine engines to reduce NOx emissions. In these engines, water\ninjection\xe2\x80\x99s impact on engine emissions, maintenance, and costs are well documented (ref. 19).\nThe effect of using water injection is to reduce combustor temperature just enough to shift the NOxgenerating mechanism into a lower temperature regime. Figure 66 shows that as the water-to-fuel ratio is\nincreased, the turbine inlet temperature decreases, which is typically only a few degrees cooler than the\ncombustor exit temperature. In this case, a 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio was calculated by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s NEPP to\nreduce T4 some 125 \xc2\xb0F, which is very close to the 120 \xc2\xb0F value obtained by the Pratt & Whitney model\n(ref. 7).\n\nFigure 64.\xe2\x80\x94NOx, smoke, HC, and CO are the regulated engine emissions.\n\nFigure 65.\xe2\x80\x94NOx emissions increase rapidly\nwith combustor temperature.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\nFigure 66.\xe2\x80\x94Adding water to the fuel\nreduces combustor temperature.\n\n52\n\nAs was seen in figure 65, this 120 to 125 \xc2\xb0F reduction in temperature can greatly reduce NOx\nemissions when the combustor flame temperatures are sufficiently high as to be on the steep part of the\nemissions slope curve. Figure 67 compares the NOx emissions index (EINOx) reduction capability of\nwater injection by plotting test data from a current technology Boeing 777 engine, two industrial engines\n(ref. 25), a very large 35-mW industrial engine (ref. 20), and laboratory tests of an experimental TVC\nsector rig (ref. 21) and current technology aeroengine combustor sector (ref. 22).\nAlthough there is some scatter in the degree of NOx reduction, figure 67 shows surprising similarities\nbetween engines that are old or new, industrial or aeroengine, large or small, experimental or production\ncombustors, as well as full-scale or laboratory sector rigs. Thus, it appears as though water injection will\nreduce NOx emissions on the order of 80 percent when a 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio is used during takeoff.\nUsing a NASA NEPP model and Boeing airplane performance and emission decks for validation,\nfigure 68 shows the present airplane NOx emissions profile and the water-injected NOx profile for the\nlarge-sized study aircraft. At 3000-ft altitude (4 mi from takeoff), the 400 gal of water are exhausted. At\nthis point, the amount of NOx saved will have been 56 lb, achieving an 80 percent reduction in takeoff\nand climbout NOx. This includes the NOx reduction due to the overall fuel savings of using water\ninjection.\nAfter reaching a 3000-ft altitude, the NOx emissions resume their same trajectory. However, the\namount of NOx reduction, especially within the airport vicinity, is very impressive.\n\nFigure 67.\xe2\x80\x94Tests have shown 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio will reduce NOx\nemissions 80 percent, which is in the range of other tests.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n53\n\nFigure 68.\xe2\x80\x94Reducing NOx 80 percent during takeoff will save\n56 lb (25.5 kg) of emissions for a 747\xe2\x80\x93400 aircraft.\nEven though water injection is quite successful in reducing NOx emissions during takeoff, lowemission combustors are still needed for the cruise and climb portion of the flight. Although the rate of\nNOx emissions is high during takeoff and initial climbout, most NOx is generated during the long cruise\nand climb periods where water injection is impractical to use due to the large quantity of water that would\nbe required.\nSmoke emissions are also anticipated to be reduced by water injection. Previous data (fig. 69) has\nshown that water-injection rates of up to 1:1 water-to-fuel ratios may be beneficial in reducing smoke\nemissions (ref. 23).\nFigure 70 shows the relationship of water injection to smoke emissions reduction for a current\ntechnology aeroengine for a Boeing 777 aircraft. As the inlet pressure to the combustor increases with\nincreasing power setting, the SAE smoke number increases for the baseline engine, indicating that smoke\nemissions are increasing. When water injection is used on the same engine in a 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio, the\nsmoke number appears to decrease dramatically. In most cases, the smoke number was too small to\nmeasure when using water injection. Similar results were obtained when increasing a water-to-fuel\ninjection ratio of 1.2:1.\nIt should be noted that the range of measurement accuracy is \xc2\xb13, as denoted by the dashed line for the\nbaseline case. When accounting for the measurement accuracy of the water-injected points, these test\nresults may not provide any statistically meaningful results.\nIt is unclear how water injection may affect small particulate emissions (e.g., PM2.5). As this is\nan area of increasing interest, since these types of emissions may have health implications, plans are\nunderway to evaluate the effect of water injection on particulate emissions in a laboratory combustor\n(ref. 24).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n54\n\nFigure 69.\xe2\x80\x94Previous tests by others have also\nshown that water injection reduces smoke.\n\nFigure 70.\xe2\x80\x94Tests on modern aeroengines have shown\nthat water injection reduces smoke emissions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n55\n\nOne of the possible negative aspects of water injection is its tendency to generate more hydrocarbons\n(HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. CO emissions data is available from ground-based industrial\nsystems that suggest this may be a manageable issue for engines with higher overall pressure ratios\n(OPRs) (ref. 25). Increases in HC emissions are anticipated to be minor and due to the very low\nregulatory level that most aircraft engines already operate at, any increases in HC emissions should be\nwell within regulatory requirements.\nAs new, low NOx combustors are usually only able to offset the additional NOx that is generated by\nnewer, higher pressure ratio cycle engines. Water injection would be able to provide reduction of real\nemissions during takeoff and climbout conditions. Smoke emissions may decrease by an order of\nmagnitude, while HC and CO emissions are anticipated to increase only slightly.\n3.4.8 Noise.\xe2\x80\x94A community noise analysis was conducted by Pratt & Whitney for the 747\xe2\x80\x93400 study\naircraft at 910 K takeoff gross weight (TOGW) (666 K lb landing weight) with water-injected PW4062\nengines. These engines incorporated the turbine rematch to correct for the compressor surge issue. A very\nsmall noise improvement was predicted for sideline and cutback noise. There was no difference for\napproach noise.\nThe in-flight engine performance was studied to compare the Fan Corrected Speed (NLR2A) and\nmass-averaged jet velocity (MAVEL) at the required in-flight net corrected thrust for the three flight\nconditions. These two parameters are used to correlate fan and jet noise.\nApproach noise: The fan speed and jet velocities were unchanged by the turbine rematch. As water\ninjection is not used at approach, no change to noise is anticipated.\nSideline noise: Water injection reduced the required fan speed and expected jet velocity at the\nrequired takeoff thrust. This slightly reduced the sideline noise less than 0.3 EPNdB for an aircraft with a\nTOGW of 910 K lb.\nFigure 71 shows that the MAVEL is reduced about 3 ft/s at a constant thrust when using water\ninjection. This reduction level is relatively constant across the thrust range levels.\nWhen using water injection, the corrected fan speed is also reduced about 20 rpm, as shown in\nfigure 72. This also helps to reduce noise at sideline and takeoff conditions.\n\nFigure 71.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection was estimated to reduce sideline takeoff\nnoise by 0.3 EPNdB partly due to reduced jet velocity.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n56\n\nFigure 72.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection also reduces noise by\ndecreasing the corrected fan speed (N1).\nCutback Noise: The same effect as was seen in the sideline case applies to noise at cutback. Namely,\nreduced fan speed and mass average jet velocity contribute to a slightly quieter noise level.\nThe degree of noise reduction in all of the three cases is minimal, and thus no environmental credit\nwill be taken in this area. However, it does show that noise will not negatively impact the airplane.\n3.4.9 Airport.\xe2\x80\x94A meeting was held with environmental and logistical support personnel at\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX) to discuss the implementation challenges and desirability\nof water injection. Although there will be implementation challenges for aircraft (they already use water\ninjection for their ground power turbine) the airport authority would support the technology if they could\ntake credit for the emission reductions achieved.\nThere will be issues with supplying conditioned water to the aircraft at the gate, but the airport will\nultimately be the end beneficiary of water injection since it will improve the local air quality.\nAccordingly, the issues and benefits to the airport need to be addressed.\nOne of the challenges that LAX has to address is how to get the conditioned water to the aircraft. As\nthis airport is very busy, they could not withstand any increase in ramp traffic that would occur with\nadditional water service trucks. It was thought that a dedicated conditioned water distribution system\nwould be needed so that each airplane could be serviced at the gate.\nAlthough the estimated water conditioning costs of $0.01 to $0.02 per gal are quite affordable (refs. 1\nand 8), the dedicated water distribution system is anticipated to be very costly to the airport. However, if\nthe airport could receive economic credit for reducing its NOx emissions, it may prove to be a worthwhile\ninvestment.\nFor its investment in such a system, LAX (and presumably other large airports) want some means to\naccount for the degree of NOx emissions reduction from water injection. This accounting process needs to\nbe relatively easy for the airport and operators to use. It was thought that each airline might submit an\nannual record of the number of times each type of aircraft was refilled with water. The International Civil\nAviation Organization (ICAO) emissions data sheets for each engine type could then be used to calculate\nthe amount of NOx reduction achieved at the airport.\nAnother issue that surfaced was how to drain the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s water tanks. A small amount of water\ndrainage could be tolerated. However, if the tanks needed to be completely drained, then the 400 gal of\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n57\n\nwater could not be drained onto the ground. For these rare situations, it might then be acceptable to have a\nwater service truck drain the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s water tanks.\nLAX airport is becoming increasingly aware of the attention being paid to particulate emissions.\nSeveral studies have been conducted, or are planned, to address fine particulate emissions. If water\ninjection reduces these emissions, it would be of value to the airport.\nLastly, the airport sees this technology for airplanes as not only a means for continued existence, but\nan avenue to grow its flight operations.\n3.4.10 Airplane Performance Impact.\xe2\x80\x94The water-injection system will adversely impact airplane\nperformance in three ways: required 4 gal more fuel during takeoff, increased fuel burn by 20 gal during\nthe rest of the mission, and for a retrofit or current production airplane, reduced the payload and range of\nthe aircraft. This is due to the SFC penalty when using water injection and the weight of the system.\nFor the combustor water-injection system, the engine suffers a 1.2 percent increase in SFC during\nclimbout due to the thermal efficiency loss of cooling the combustion products. Using water injection to\n3000-ft altitude results in a 26 lb (4 gal) increase in fuel consumption as shown in\nfigure 73.\nThere is also a cruise fuel penalty from having to carry the added weight of the water-injection\nsystem. For the 747\xe2\x80\x93400 aircraft equipped with either of the water-injection schemes on a 3000 n mi\nmission, an additional 20 gal (137 lb) of fuel would be required to carry the weight of the empty system.\nFor the entire 3000 n mi mission, 24 gal of more fuel would be required for the combustor waterinjection system as shown in figure 74.\nFor a newly designed engine and airframe, the airplane design can be cycled to account for the added\nweight of the water-injection system, so the payload and range penalties would be removed as compared\nto the baseline airplane. The operating empty weight (OEW) would increase though, which is undesirable.\nFor a retrofit or current production airplane, the added weight of the water-injection system and the water\nitself would decrease the payload and range.\n\nFigure 73.\xe2\x80\x94The 1.2 percent SFC penalty for using water injection to\n3000 ft results in 4 gal more fuel use during takeoff.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n58\n\nFigure 74.\xe2\x80\x94Added system weight and takeoff SFC penalty together\nresult in an additional 24 gal of fuel used on a 3000 n mi mission.\n\nFigure 75.\xe2\x80\x94The added weight of the water (if used) could reduce\nthe payload 4088 lb or range by 59 n mi on certain flights.\nWhen using water injection on a retrofit or current production airplane, there would be a 4088-lb\npayload penalty to account for the system weight and the weight of the water. However, since use of the\nwater-injection system is optional, the operator may choose to not exercise it on flights with high\npayloads. Thus, in this instance, there would be a 748-lb payload penalty to account for the empty weight\nof the water-injection system.\n3.4.11 Failure Modes.\xe2\x80\x94Before the water-injection system could be considered for use in aircraft\nservice, an in-depth analysis of its failure modes and effects needs to be conducted. Measures to assure\nthat the system would not jeopardize the safety of the aircraft would then be designed into the final\nsystem.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n59\n\nSome examples of failure modes worth considering are\n(1) Water-injection system fails part way into the climb and takeoff: Although the additional thrust\ncapability of the water-injection system is not being utilized, there could be a slight increase in thrust\nshould the water-injection system fail. Use of the water injection results in a 1.2-percent SFC penalty\nduring takeoff. Thus, if the fuel flow rate were increased during takeoff to account for the 1.2-percent\npenalty, the thrust level was held constant, the water-injection system failed, and the engine FADEC\ncontroller did not correct for the water flow rate change, then the engine would deliver more thrust\nassociated with the increased throttle setting. This would lead to a thrust asymmetry that would require\naction from the pilot (e.g., retard throttle on increased thrust engine and/or increase rudder action.\n(2) Injection system fails off, then comes back on: As the water-injection system is cooling the\nturbine hot section, failure of the system would result in a rapid increase in turbine inlet temperature. If\nthe water-injection system then started delivering water once again, and the engine FADEC controller\nfailed to properly introduce the water slowly to the engine, then it could result in a rapid cooling action,\nwhich may result in a thermal shock to the engine hot section. Rapid temperature changes are detrimental\nto engine hot section life.\n(3) Injection system does not fully evacuate the tanks prior to attaining freezing altitude: If the water\ndrain system failed to fully evacuate the water tanks and the cargo hold heating system failed, then the\nresidual water in the tanks could freeze. Water left in the pump suction feed lines could freeze and swell,\nwhich would damage the pipes and possibly the water pump wetted parts.\n(4) Flow regulation system malfunction: The flow rate of the water injection is at least as important as\nthe fuel system and therefore will need the same level of complexity in control and measurement as a fuel\nsystem (metering valve, flowmeter, pressure sensors, etc.). If the system failed to gradually introduce\nwater to the engine during spoolup, it could lead to thermal stressing of the engine hot section. If the flow\nregulation system failed in the \xe2\x80\x9cfull open\xe2\x80\x9d mode, then more water could be delivered to the engine than\ndesired. The system would need to be designed such that this failure would not lead to engine flameout\n(possibly by sizing the water-injection pumps so that they could not deliver that much water).\n(5) Heated drain mast damaged: The heated drain mast will be dispatch critical if damage to it would\nresult in the water tanks and system not being able to drain properly.\n(6) EGT margin exceedance during go around: The 747\xe2\x80\x93400 must have the capability to use full\ntakeoff rating, without the use of water injection. For \xe2\x80\x9cgo-around\xe2\x80\x9d operation the dry redline margin must\nnot be exceeded. The capability to achieve this redline rating needs to be tracked. Operators would likely\nbe required to perform dry takeoffs at regular intervals to assess the residual EGT margin.\n(7) Cargo hold (and water tanks) freeze while on the ground: If the aircraft were serviced with water\nduring freezing atmospheric conditions and the cargo doors were left open for an extended period of time\nand the ECS system were not engaged or was inoperative, the water in the tanks could freeze and damage\nthe tanks. If the aircraft then took off, it would take an extended amount of time to drain the water lines\nand the tanks while the frozen water melted. If the tanks ruptured from the freezing water, the water\nwould then drain into the lower cargo hold, necessitating repair and inspection of the tank as well as the\ninsulation blankets and any other affected system.\n(8) Introduction of contaminated water: The water refill service system is anticipated to contain two\nwater contamination sensors. However, if both sensors failed and the water conditioning system failed\nand the tap water introduced into the tank from the airport supply system was of poor quality, the\ncontaminated water would result in rapid deterioration of the engine hot section and require a sooner\noverhaul.\n(9) Single failure of water quality\xe2\x80\x99s impact on all engines: If contaminated water was introduced into\nthe aircraft (per number 8 above), then all of the engines would be affected.\n(10) Water nozzle failure impact on pattern factor: Should the combined fuel and water nozzle fail, a\nnonuniform water spray (or fuel spray) would adversely impact the thermal gradient pattern factor, which\nwould reduce the engine hot section life.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n60\n\n(11) Engine water shutoff drain valve failure: If the engine water drain valve should fail in the closed\nposition, the water manifold would remain filled with water. If the aircraft were then to be parked\novernight in a cold climate, the water could freeze and damage the water pipes. If the valve were to fail in\nthe \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d position, then the water flow to the engine fuel/water nozzles would be decreased. This would\nlead to a higher thrust level and higher turbine inlet temperature, similar to scenario number 1 above.\n(12) Water tank drain valve fails open and several tank vents become simultaneously blocked: In this\nscenario, a pressure imbalance could occur between the interior of the lower ambient pressure water tank\n(because the drain valve to the outside is stuck open) and the higher pressure surrounding the tank from\nthe pressurized cabin. If the differential became sufficiently high, the water tank would collapse. When\nthe airplane landed and if the damage was undetected, the tanks might then be attempted to be refilled,\nwhich would result in the lower cargo hold becoming flooded, similar to the water freezing scenario\nnumber 7 above.\nEach of these failure modes and effects, and others not yet thought of, will need to be addressed to\nmake sure the water-injection system is reliable and will not present any safety issues to the airplane.\n3.4.12 Value of Water Injection.\xe2\x80\x94Four different models were used to compare the relative value of\nthe technology: (1) a BCA original equipment manufacturer (OEM) business model that strictly evaluates\nthe return on investment (sec. 3.4.12.1), (2) a BCA technology valuation model that gives credit for\nenvironmental benefits (sec. 3.4.12.2), (3) a customer airplane operating cost model (sec. 3.4.12.3), and\n(4) a Boeing Phantom Works trade study model (sec. 3.4.12.4).\nEach of the models evaluated water injection for the following three scenarios: (1) as a retrofit kit for\na 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER airplane already in service, (2) for an updated design to a current production 747 aircraft,\nand (3) for a newly designed engine and 747-sized airframe.\nIn all of the business case scenarios studied, the results were judged to be of poor value if the operator\nor OEM did not recover (in some way) their investment. The models should be used to compare the\nrelative value between the implementation scenarios. Further, more in-depth system design and analysis\nwould be required to provide absolute values that have higher confidence. However, all four models\nprovided the same outcome and suggested that the retrofit scenario would be very costly to implement\nwhile the newly designed airplane was the best value. The new production airplane scenario was slightly\npositive.\n3.4.12.1 OEM Business Model: Ideally, to assure successful implementation, a new environmental\ntechnology would not only offer environmental benefits, but also be of some financial value to both the\nmanufacturer and the end user. In one or two of the following three implementation scenarios to be\ndiscussed, water injection may be able to satisfy these rare simultaneous goals.\nAs illustrated in figure 76, achieving a positive net present value (NPV) for water injection involves\nselling enough water injection units at a reasonable profit to recover the nonrecurring cost of developing\nthe technology. An additional value to the OEM could be the potential to sell more aircraft to customers\nwhose operations are being constrained by airport emission restrictions.\nThe nonrecurring costs are associated with design, tooling, system testing, and certification of the\nwater-injection system. As shown in figure 77, these costs are estimated to be quite substantial and can\nrun upwards of $70 to $75 M for the retrofit and production aircraft cases. This is largely due to the\nassociated testing and certification costs. Namely, the engine manufacturer would have to conduct special\nengine durability, operational, and certification tests of the water-injection system. The airframe portion\nwould also have to undergo these tests and certification.\nNormally, for a new airplane design, development and certification tests for a specific technology\nwould be conducted during the certification of the entire airplane and therefore the incremental costs of\ntesting the water-injection system would be small. Therefore, the nonrecurring costs for the new airplane\ndesign case shown in figure 77 are substantially less as they are mostly made up of engineering design\nhours and not the aforementioned special testing and certification costs.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n61\n\nFigure 76.\xe2\x80\x94The OEMs will have to offset nonrecurring costs\nwith projected revenue in order for NPV to be positive.\n\nFigure 77.\xe2\x80\x94Nonrecurring development costs will be\nquite high for the retrofit water-injection system.\nRecurring costs to the OEM are those related to purchasing the materials and equipment for each\nwater-injection system (e.g., tubes, pumps, valves, tanks, etc.).\nThe recurring costs to the OEM are also very high for the retrofit case. This is due to the fact that\nmany costly engine parts (e.g., fuel nozzles) on the in-service engine would need to be replaced with\nretrofit parts while a new engine would simply incorporate the water-injection design into the existing\nequipment.\nThe recurring cost to the OEM would be about the same for either the production airplane or the\nnewly designed airplane. These are indicated in figure 78 by the bars titled \xe2\x80\x9cRecurring cost to OEM.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe number of water-injection systems that are anticipated to be sold will affect the ultimate sales\ncost. This is due to the need to recover the OEM\xe2\x80\x99s nonrecurring development costs. Thus, a potential\nmarket for water-injection kits was estimated and the percent of market capture was calculated at\n50 percent. Error bars indicate market capture rates from 25 to 100 percent.\nFor the retrofit case, there are approximately six hundred 747\xe2\x80\x93400 series aircraft presently in service.\nTheir average age is 9 years old. The retrofit kit would only be installed in aircraft that are undergoing\nmajor overhaul. To do otherwise could require replacement of the nozzle guide vanes on some engine\nmodels, which might add another \xe2\x89\x88$1 M to the kit. For this study, it was estimated there could be a\npotential 150 water-injection kits sold. Older aircraft were not considered as they were too close to\nretirement for this expensive upgrade.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n62\n\nFigure 78.\xe2\x80\x94Retrofit water-injection kit has high nonrecurring (fig. 77)\nand recurring costs with small potential market, which drives up sales cost.\nFor the 747 production aircraft case, a very high level estimate of 260 water-injection systems was\nused. The cost shown was also based on a market capture of 50 percent with error bars showing ranges\nfrom 25 to 100 percent of the potential market.\nLastly, for a newly designed airplane scenario, more water-injection units could be sold as this\nairplane would conceivably be in production for a much longer period.\nTo calculate the retail sales cost of the water-injection system, production time lines were set for each\nof the scenarios. For example, the retrofit scenario had a relatively short duration of 5 years in which all\nof the candidate airplanes would be retrofitted. The nonrecurring cost would need to be recovered over\neach of the time periods and this is added to the OEM recurring cost of the equipment plus a costescalation margin. Given these assumptions, the costs of the kits are illustrated in figure 78 by the bars\ntitled \xe2\x80\x9cSales cost.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor the retrofit case, the high OEM recurring cost, high nonrecurring development cost, and a small\npotential market makes the cost of the water-injection system in the $2.5 M range per airplane.\nThe sales cost for the production airplane water-injection case is substantially less because the\nrecurring costs are less (fuel nozzles do not have to be replaced). Since the kit costs are less, there is a\nhigher probability that more customers would be interested in such an option. Thus, the sales cost of such\na unit could be in the $1 M range if more than 50 percent of customers ordered the option. Given the\nassociated risk of the project, this scenario only makes for a fair business case.\nFor the newly designed airplane/engine scenario, the water-injection kit costs are substantially less\nthan the production airplane since there is a larger potential market. For this case, the water-injection\nsystems might cost in the $750 K range. As this scenario makes the best business case for an airplane\noperator (discussed in next section), it was thought that there would be a good chance for the OEM to sell\nenough kits to recover the nonrecurring development costs. This reduces the program risk and therefore\ndelivers an acceptable business case for the OEM (table XI).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n63\n\nTABLE XI.\xe2\x80\x94WATER INJECTION RETROFIT KITS MAKE A VERY POOR BUSINESS CASE BUT ARE AN\n\xe2\x80\x9cOK\xe2\x80\x9d BUSINESS CASE WHEN INCORPORATED INTO A NEWLY DESIGNED LARGE AIRPLANE\nType of installation (on a large aircraft)\nEstimated potential market\nSystem cost (each)\nChance of sales\nBusiness case\n\nRetrofit kit\n150\n$2.2 to $2.9 M\nPoor\nVery poor\n\nProduction airplane\n260\n$860 K to $2.6 M\nUnknown\nMarginal\n\nNew airplane design\n500\n$575 K to $1.4 M\nOK\nOK\n\nWhen considering the attractiveness of the technology to the customer, the OEM development costs,\nand the airplane operating cost impact, an overall quantitative business case can be made for water\ninjection. Figure 79 shows the business case for water-injection technology for the three implementation\nscenarios (retrofit, production, and new airplanes). It shows that the retrofit case provides a negative\nvalue, while the production airplane could break even when slightly more than 25 percent of the airplanes\nsold incorporate the kit. The newly designed large airplane shows a positive business case.\n3.4.12.2 Technology Value: When evaluating an environmental technology strictly from a monetary\n\xe2\x80\x9creturn on investment\xe2\x80\x9d viewpoint, the long-term benefits that may be more intrinsic to the long-term\nsurvival of the company (and possibly planet) are often not accounted for. Therefore, a second business\nmodel is presented that gives credit for environmental benefits.\nFigure 80 provides a comparative value analysis of the three water-injection implementation\nscenarios. Again, the retrofit scenario had the least value while the new airplane design had the\nhighest value.\n\nFigure 79.\xe2\x80\x94Retrofit case does not make a good industry business case,\nbut other scenarios may provide a positive NPV for the technology.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n64\n\nFigure 80.\xe2\x80\x94Technology value analysis, that includes credit for environment,\nshows similar trends to the OEM business case in figure 79.\n\nFigure 81.\xe2\x80\x94Airplane operators will most likely need to\nbalance the costs of water injection with revenue.\n3.4.12.3 Value to the Operator: The third value model evaluates the value of water injection from an\nairplane operator standpoint. This model includes the capital cost of purchasing the water-injection\nsystem, the operating costs of the system, the cost of lost payload capability, and the anticipated engine\nmaintenance savings that would come from the turbine life improvements identified in section 3.4.6.\nA few (mostly European) airline operators would most likely be interested in the environmental\nbenefits that water injection has to offer. They might be willing to pay for some inconvenience and cost of\nthe system. However, most airlines will be driven by the economics of water injection. Like the OEM\nbusiness case, these operators will want to assess the costs of water injection versus any derived revenue\nin order to see if the system offers a positive NPV for them.\n3.4.12.3.1 Operator Costs: The costs that an airline operator would incur with the water-injection\nsystem are for purchasing the system, maintaining it, filling the system with conditioned water, the fuel\npenalty of having to carry the added weight, and the loss of payload capability (about four passengers\nwhen water injection is not used).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n65\n\nPreliminary system costs were calculated and included (1) the amortized cost of purchasing the waterinjection system, (2) the cost of the system, (3) airframe maintenance costs that were scaled from\nhistorical TWA data, (4) the personnel and truck rental costs to fill the airplane with water, (5) the cost of\nthe demineralized conditioned water (which is substantially less expensive now due to new reverse\nosmosis systems), (6) cruise fuel penalty from having to carry 748 lb of system weight (7) the takeoff fuel\npenalty from the 1.2 percent increase in SFC; and (8) miscellaneous costs that included the potential\nrevenue loss for the decreased payload.\nThe penalty for loss of payload capability, from carrying the added 748 lb of system weight, can be\nreduced for a new airplane design. Namely, the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s operating empty weight was increased to\naccount for the increased weight of the water-injection system and maintain the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s same payload\ncapability. However, there is still some added cost associated with this scenario as heavier aircraft then\nhave higher landing fees, higher pilot salaries, and poorer fuel efficiency. These costs were all taken into\naccount for this scenario.\nCost of purchasing conditioning the water to the airplane operator, and its delivery, was also included\nin the calculations. The previous study (ref. 1) provides detail on these. It was assumed the airplane\noperator would incur water conditioning costs that are in-line with current industrial gas turbine user rates\n(ref. 8) as well as standard accepted airplane servicing rates (ref. 26). In some instances, there\ncould be substantial airport infrastructure cost, but these would most likely be borne by the airport if\nthey wanted the operator to use the conditioned water for emissions benefits (ref. 27).\nIt should be noted that the highest operating unit cost was for the money or interest that the\noperator would pay to purchase the water-injection system. This analysis used a standard business\nvalue of 16.7 percent to calculate the cost, which may be conservative and would then unduly penalize the\noperating economic analysis.\nOffsetting these costs will be the revenue derived from engine maintenance cost savings and in some\ncases, emissions landing fees. These are described next.\n3.4.12.3.2 Operator Revenue: Usually, one must look beyond the immediate short-term financial costs\nto appreciate the long-term sustainability that environmental technologies can offer. Still, even if the\nenvironmental benefits of water injection are dismissed, this technology may be able to also offer shortterm financial benefits. Revenue can be derived from engine maintenance savings and emissions-based\nlanding fees.\nAirports in Sweden, Switzerland, and London have emissions-based landing fees. Other airports are\nalso considering implementing emissions-based landing fees. Sweden has the highest emissions-based\nlanding fees and figure 82 shows these for some aircraft. The varying fee levels are related to the different\ntypes of engine makes that can be on the same airframe and are not shown. The figure also shows the fee\nthat the study aircraft with water injection would pay. For the 747 study airplane, an operator would save\n$198.00 per landing.\nThe engine maintenance cost savings for water injection are difficult to estimate. These costs are also\nconsidered competitive information by the engine companies, making data gathering difficult. However,\nthe following discussion shows cost trends that are ultimately validated by a single $22/hr/engine number\nprovided by Pratt & Whitney for the PW4062 engine.\nEach engine make and model typically has a different reliability record; some engines experience\nmore required maintenance in specific components than others. However, the hot section of an engine\ndoes tend to require a significant share of maintenance when compared to other components. Figure 83\nillustrates the engine removal rates over a year for a 1980\xe2\x80\x99s vintage engine (A) and the newest 1990\xe2\x80\x99s\ndesigned engine (B) for two different manufacturers. It shows that hot section components account for\nbetween 25 and 40 percent of the reason engines are removed from service. Combustors appear to make\nup a very small part of the engine removal pie.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n66\n\nFigure 82.\xe2\x80\x94Water injection would save a 747 operator $198\non Swedish-based emissions landing fees.\n\nFigure 83.\xe2\x80\x94Turbine-related engine removals still account for a sizable\nportion of the reason engines are removed from service for maintenance.\nFor engines that experience higher removal rates due to turbine blade thermal distress, water injection\nwould no doubt be of more value.\nFor whatever reason an engine is removed from service, the turbine then often also receives attention,\nwhich contributes a significant portion towards the overhaul cost. Typically, the engine hot section\naccount for 60 percent of engine maintenance costs (ref. 28).\nThe Cash Airplane Related Operating Cost (CAROC) for the 747\xe2\x80\x93400ER was used to estimate the\nengine maintenance cost savings of the water-injection system. Figure 84 illustrates the CAROC\nbreakdown for this airplane on a 3000 n mi mission and highlights the engine maintenance portion.\nUsing the 60 percent turbine cost factor, the 29 percent hot section life improvement estimated by\nP&W, and the above 747 airplane cash airplane operating costs, the $22/hr/engine number provided by\nPratt & Whitney is validated.\n3.4.12.3.3 Operator Cost/Benefit Analysis: Tallying the CAROC is a common method for evaluating\nthe worth of a technology to the airplane operator. Water injection provides a 1.1 percent reduction in\nCAROC. However, CAROC does not include the cost of the system, which is included in the airplane\ncost and reflected in the Total Airplane Related Operating Cost (TAROC). TAROC can be very difficult\nto calculate as the cost of the airplane and financing method will vary between operators. Therefore, a\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n67\n\nmodified CAROC approach, that includes the cost of the system, is used in this study to evaluate the\nworth of water injection to the operator.\nFigure 85 shows a breakdown of the most optimistic business case for water injection costs on a\nnewly designed airplane and the savings that an airline operator might experience (expressed as a percent\nof CAROC). As shown below, the cost savings from the reduced engine maintenance is anticipated to\nmore than offset the added costs of purchasing and maintaining the water-injection system. It is estimated\nthat an operator would experience a 0.65 percent reduction in operating cost for the system on a newly\ndesigned airplane and engine.\nFor operators who may experience emissions-based landing fees, the savings increases to 1.1 percent\nas the operator is now saving an additional $198 per landing due to the reduced NOx emissions.\n\nFigure 84.\xe2\x80\x94Engine maintenance is a significant portion of CAROC.\n\nFigure 85.\xe2\x80\x94Under the best circumstances, savings from turbine maintenance may offset\nwater-injection costs to provide a 0.65 percent savings to the airplane operator.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n68\n\nFigure 86.\xe2\x80\x94If emissions-based landing fees are included, savings\nwill increase to 1.1 percent on airplane operating costs.\n\nFigure 87.\xe2\x80\x94Retrofit water-injection kits would cost airplane operators\nmoney but would save money on a newly designed airplane.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n69\n\nThese values were for the most optimistic estimates, given a zero NPV of the technology for the\nOEMs. When factoring in OEM profits and market risks, the business case deteriorates. How the waterinjection system affects airplane operating cost is shown in figure 87 for the three implementation\nscenarios. Error bars show how the sales price of the water-injection system, which is based on the\nnumber of units sold, will affect the operator\xe2\x80\x99s costs.\nClearly, the retrofit scenario is cost prohibitive. This is due to the small number of kit sales (150),\nhigh nonrecurring costs ($74 M), shorter life span of the airplane to recover kit costs (assumed airplane\nlife is half used) and the high cost (16.7 percent) for a pricey water-injection kit ($2.2 to $2.9 M).\nThe water-injection system for the production airplane scenario warrants further investigation. If a\nsufficient quantity of systems were sold at minimal cost, it could prove worthwhile for reducing airplane\noperating costs. To explore this scenario requires discussions with airplane operators to more accurately\ngage the potential market for the technology.\nThe operating cost-reduction potential for the new airplane scenario is favorable. With these types of\npotential savings, the technology could be desirable enough to generate a market for water injection based\non engine maintenance savings alone. The emissions benefits will then be quite attractive. For example,\nwhen one considers the amount being spent by industrial customers around the world to reduce NOx\nemissions, it can vary from the $5,000 per ton range to approximately $60,000 per ton for applications in\nEuropean cities. If the water-injection system can save airline customers on operating costs, then the 80\npercent takeoff reduction of NOx emissions will be free or there will be even a negative cost as illustrated\nin figure 88.\n\nFigure 88.\xe2\x80\x94Airplane NOx emissions reduction cost is attractive when\ncompared to what other sectors are paying to reduce emissions.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n70\n\nFigure 89.\xe2\x80\x94Boeing Pratt & Whitney trade study model was one of\nfour used to rank the value of the water-injection system.\n3.4.12.4 Boeing Phantom Works Trade Model: The forth model used in this study was originally\ndeveloped to assess alternatives and decide on a preferred approach. The process flow is shown in\nfigure 89.\nWith regard to the figure above, the need, purpose, scope, assumptions, and plans have already been\ndiscussed. The evaluation criteria and weighting factors for this study are illustrated in the table below.\nThe weighting factors were calculated through a Boeing proprietary code, based on ranking the\nimportance of each criteria against the others (e.g., safety vs. range, safety vs. SFC, etc.).\nTABLE XII.\xe2\x80\x94EVALUATION CRITERIA AND WEIGHTING\nFACTORS USED FOR TRADE STUDY\nNo.\n\nEvaluation Criteria\n\nWeight\n\n1\n\nSafety\n\n0.428\n\n2\n\nRange/payload\n\n0.147\n\n3\n\nSFC\n\n0.135\n\n4\n\nMaintenance\n\n0.103\n\n5\n\nEnvironmental benefit\n\n0.055\n\n6\n\nAcquisition cost\n\n0.05\n\n7\n\nSystem simplicity\n\n0.043\n\n8\n\nAirport logistics\n\n0.022\n\n9\n\nDevelopment costs\n\n0.018\n\nTotal\n\n1.000\n\nSix scenarios or cases were evaluated to rank them against one another using the weights established\nin the table above and the degree to which each case is able to satisfy the evaluation criteria. The matrix\nbelow describes the six cases.\nOf the all the cases evaluated, the water misting design on a new airplane (option F) had the highest\nscore. This is assuming that the earlier-mentioned engine technical challenges could be overcome.\nThe second choice would be for the combustor water-injection system on a newly designed airplane\n(option C). Figure 91 shows high-level results of this trade study.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n71\n\nRetrofit airplane\nWater injection\nWater misting\n\nProduction airplane\n\nNew airplane design\n\nCase A\n\nCase B\n\nCase C\n\nCase D\n\nCase E\n\nCase F\n\nFigure 90.\xe2\x80\x94Trade study cases evaluated.\n\nFigure 91.\xe2\x80\x94Option F (water misting on new airplane design) is first choice,\nfollowed by option C (water injection on new airplane design).\nSafety was the overriding weighting factor for this analysis. This criteria is very sensitive, therefore,\nany slight downwards variation in safety would bring the particular water-injection option into last place.\nIt was assumed that all of the configurations would have the same level of safety.\n\n4.0 Conclusions and Recommendations\n4.1 Summary of Results\n\nIn deciding on the preferred method of injecting water into the engine, the compressor water-misting\nscheme had the best value. However, the combustor water-injection scheme was chosen as the preferred\noption since the engine manufacturer did not have a clear path to solve the associated compressor surge\nissues with water misting and combustor water injection offered less development risk.\nEngine performance penalties and compressor operational challenges could still be expected if water\ninjection were to be installed on existing engines as a retrofit kit. This could most likely be addressed\nduring the design phase for a newly designed engine.\nThe water-injection system could achieve up to an 80 percent NOx reduction during takeoff when\na 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio is used to 3000-ft altitude. This requires 400 gal of conditioned water for a\n747 airplane. Smoke emissions could possibly be reduced by up to fourfold.\nWith a 120 \xc2\xb0F decrease in turbine inlet temperature, due to the cooling action of the water, the turbine\nlife on a PW4062 engine is estimated to increase by 29 percent when takeoff thrust is held constant. For a\nmore modern engine, the estimated life benefit would be less, ranging from 0 to\n20 percent.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n72\n\nThere is a 748-lb weight penalty to carry the water-injection system components on the 747. When\nthe water-injection system is chosen to be operated, there would be an additional 3340 lb reduction in\npayload capability for the 400 gal of water. Use of the water-injection system was considered optional, so\nthat no safety issues would arise should the system fail or the full payload capability of the airplane was\nneeded.\nNonrecurring engineering, testing, and certification costs for water injection are less if the system is\ndesigned into a new airplane at the start of a program. These costs would escalate dramatically if water\ninjection were to be specially designed and certified for an existing airplane as a retrofit kit. The recurring\ncost for the water-injection system itself is relatively minimal.\nTaking into account the water-injection system operating costs and the engine maintenance savings,\nan airplane operator is expected to save approximately 0.65 percent in airplane-related operating costs.\nFor operators flying into airports with emissions-based charges, operator savings could increase to as\nmuch as 1.1 percent.\n4.2 Analysis of Results\n\nDue to the high water-injection development, certification, and testing costs, as well as a 0.4 percent\nSFC cruise performance loss on a retrofitted engine, water injection only seems to provide an acceptable\nbusiness case for use on new airplane designs.\nThere is disagreement within the aerospace community as to the degree of turbine life improvement,\nbut most agree that water injection will likely extend the life of the engine hot section. This is anticipated\nto save an operator on engine maintenance costs.\nThere is also uncertainty about the degree of compressor surge margin deterioration that the LPC\nwater misting and combustor water-injection systems would cause. This could possibly be ameliorated in\na new engine design.\nIf these life extension questions and operational issues can be resolved, the 80 percent reduction in\ntakeoff NOx and possible fourfold reduction in smoke could make water injection a very cost-effective\nemissions-reduction technology. For airports and airplane operators whose growth is being constrained by\nNOx emissions, water injection may be an attractive option.\nThe poor reputation of older water-injection systems, the added airplane weight of the system, and\nthe inconvenience of having to fill the aircraft with demineralized water will be major negative issues to\ndeal with.\nAlthough water injection has been used for many years on older commercial aircraft and is currently\nused in industrial gas turbine engines, it is an unproven technology for modern aeroengines. Therefore,\nwater injection for commercial aircraft is presently at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 3 to 4. The\ntechnology would most likely rapidly progress to TRL 9 based on the historical and industrial experience\nof water injection.\n4.3 Recommendation\n4.3.1. Suggested Action.\xe2\x80\x94Based on the above analysis of results, it is suggested that future research\nprimarily focus on removing the engine uncertainties associated with water injection. Water injection for\naeroengines should be brought to a TRL of 6 by NASA. A system prototype demonstration of the\ntechnology on a new engine demonstrator would be ideal. The airframe portion of the water-injection\nsystem may be less challenging to implement, but still needs to be included to support any prototype\nsystem test of engine water injection.\nAs most NOx is emitted during cruise, a study should be undertaken to see if cruise NOx could be\nreduced by optimizing the combustor for this phase of flight while relying on water injection to control\ntakeoff NOx.\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n73\n\n4.3.2. Future Planned Work.\xe2\x80\x94It is anticipated that the airframe company(s) could work with some\nengine companies to agree on a \xe2\x80\x9cgo forward\xe2\x80\x9d plan. This may involve getting feedback from airplane\noperators who would use such a system. If there is sufficient market demand, support of the technology\nfrom industry, and the findings of this report are validated by a system prototype demonstration, water\ninjection might then be rapidly developed for future new aircraft as an emissions-reduction option.\n\nReferences\n1.

Waitz\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nCambridge, Massachusetts 02139\n\nAbstract\nThe implementation of a water injection system in commercial airplane engines holds the potential\nfor significant reductions in NOx and soot emissions as well as improvement in the engine hot section life.\nImprovement in the hot section life is anticipated as water injection reduces the operating temperature of\nthe engine components. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of water injection specifically on\nturbine blade life and on maintenance costs. The dominant mechanisms of failure in the turbine are\nidentified as low cycle fatigue, creep and oxidation. Using the Universal Slopes method, a preliminary\nquantitative analysis of possible fatigue life benefits from water injection has been performed in this\nreport for three representative blade materials, Inconel 625, Inconel 706 and Rene 80. For a 67 K (120 \xc2\xb0R)\nchange in turbine inlet temperature, the results have shown that possible life improvement ranges from a\nfactor of 2 to 4.5 for Inconel 625 depending on the strains imposed. Similarly, life improves by a factor of\napproximately 1.65 for Inconel 706 and by a factor of about 3.5 for Rene 80 under thermally varying\nstrains with the same turbine inlet temperature reduction. The results of this fatigue analysis depend\nstrongly on the material properties and operating temperatures. A sensitivity analysis shows the trends in\nfatigue life estimates for varying loads and materials. Detailed analyses of the combined effects of\nfatigue, creep and oxidation are not feasible through a generic life model. Consequently, a brief overview\nof the effects of creep and oxidation is presented as found in the literature. It is seen that life estimates\nbased on all three mechanisms are sensitive to metal and gas temperatures (internal and external to the\nblade) and to stress levels. Creep-fatigue interaction and the influence of temperature are demonstrated\nthrough a representative alloy, SRR99.\nIn addition, a maintenance cost analysis was performed to evaluate and compare benefits resulting\nfrom engine de-rate and water injection. An engine cycle program (GasTurb,) and airline data were used\nfor this analysis to establish a correlation between changes in turbine inlet temperature and corresponding\nchanges in costs for a typical 1970\xe2\x80\x99s technology mixed flow turbofan engine. This analysis proposes that\nwater injection may achieve the same engine cost benefits as de-rate by extending the life of the turbine.\nShorter range flights, with more takeoffs per day, experience larger benefits. Absolute life benefits\ndepend on the engine cycle.\nThe shortcomings of these studies are also discussed and recommendations for future work are\npresented.\n\n1. Introduction\nWater injection is a well-established technology in the industrial power generation sector and is used\nfor NOx reduction as well as power augmentation. In the aviation industry, water injection has been used\nin the early Boeing 707 and Boeing 747 commercial jet engines for takeoff thrust boosting; however,\ncurrent technology jet engines are capable of much higher power production and no longer use water\ninjection for that purpose. Today, the technology holds the potential to improve the engine hot section life\nin addition to reducing NOx and soot emissions. Data obtained from Boeing reveals that NOx reductions\nof up to 80 percent are possible during takeoff when atomized water is sprayed into the combustor with a\nwater to fuel ratio of 1:1. This corresponds to temperature reductions of approximately 67 K (120 \xc2\xb0R) in\nthe turbine inlet. It is assumed that a change in turbine inlet gas temperature of 67 K (120 \xc2\xb0R) corresponds\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n77\n\nto the same change in metal temperature. A thermal effect of this magnitude during the critical takeoff\nportion of the mission can have significant impacts on the turbine life.\nThis report quantifies the possible turbine life benefits due to water injection, expressed in terms of\ngeneral trends observed in the predicted life as a function of metal temperature. The results developed are\nnot limited to a particular type of engine or other design details such as blade geometry, but are\nrepresentative and expressed in terms of generic test specimen data sets without consideration of coatings.\nFatigue, resulting from cyclic loading on the components, creep and oxidation are known to be dominant\nfailure mechanisms in the engine hot section. The turbine material properties and thermal loads vary\ngreatly with operating temperatures. A parametric analysis of a commonly used fatigue lifing\nmethodology is presented through this paper over a range of load conditions and using three different\nrepresentative materials. Creep and oxidation life modeling requires detailed material data usually\nobtained experimentally for a specific material. Owing to the complex interactions between these three\nmechanisms and the wide range of material data needed, it is a challenging task to develop a generic\nmodel that provides good life estimates regardless of material type, loads and temperatures involved. This\nextends beyond the scope of the current study and thus, effects of creep and oxidation on life estimates\nare demonstrated as obtained through a literature review for different nickel-base alloys.\nFor the purposes of this report, it is necessary not only to quantify the impacts of water injection on\nturbine life, but also to address the potential maintenance costs benefits. Turbine inlet temperature\nreduction from water injection can be compared with similar reductions achieved due to engine de-rated\noperations. Airline data (ref. 1) available for material maintenance costs associated with de-rated\noperations for a 1970s technology mixed flow turbofan engine can be used to estimate the cost benefits\nassociated with water injection. Engine cycle-deck results from GasTurb (ref. 2) are utilized in converting\nthe 120 \xc2\xb0R change in T4 to a range of takeoff de-rate levels. The maintenance cost analysis is then\npresented in the form of percent reductions in cost for the de-rate range and for different flight times. It is\nimportant to note that while the results for the turbine life blade analysis are generic, the maintenance cost\nanalysis is done for a specific engine based on data availability and is representative of potential cost\nbenefits.\n\n2. Failure Mechanisms\nOne of the dominant mechanisms of failure in engine hot section components is fatigue, resulting\nfrom cyclic loading of the parts. Specifically, turbine blades are subjected to high centrifugal stress levels\nand aerodynamic loadings at elevated temperatures in a corrosive environment. Degradation of turbine\nblades thus results from a combination of cyclic high stress levels, creep effects from exposure to elevated\ntemperatures as well as environmental factors. Critical cyclic stress levels imposed for a short duration of\ntime such as take-off correspond to low cycle fatigue failure of the hot section components.\n2.1 Fatigue\n\nFatigue life characterization under such conditions is commonly done through total life\napproaches, where life is divided into two distinct regimes: crack initiation and crack propagation (ref. 3).\nTotal life approaches are based on stress levels or strain levels usually predicting life up to crack initiation\nand then the propagation life to a critical crack size that is designated as failure. Depending on the\noperating conditions and loads imposed on the part, the total life of the part is divided between these\ntwo regimes.\n2.1.1 Crack initiation life.\xe2\x80\x94In the case of low cycle fatigue at elevated temperatures, material\nbehavior is not purely in the elastic range. Under such circumstances, fatigue life is characterized in terms\nof the total strain range that the part is subjected to (ref. 3). The total strain amplitude is divided into its\nelastic and plastic strain amplitudes given by:\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n78\n\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 \xce\x94\xce\xb5 e \xce\x94\xce\xb5 p\n=\n+\n2\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 e\n\xe2\x80\x93 elastic strain\n2\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 p\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 plastic strain\n\n2\n\nBased on log-log plots in terms of cycles to failure and stress levels of experimental data, the elastic strain\ncan be expressed through the Basquin equation (ref. 3) as:\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 e \xcf\x83 \' f\n(2 N f ) b\n=\n2\nE\nE\n\xcf\x83 \'f\n\nYoung\xe2\x80\x99s modulus [Pa]\nfatigue strength coefficient [Pa]\n\nb\nNf\n\n(2)\n\nfatigue strength or the Basquin exponent (ranging from \xe2\x80\x930.05~ \xe2\x80\x930.12)\nnumber of cycles to crack initiation\n\nSimilarly, according to the Coffin-Manson relation, the plastic strain component is expressed as:\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 p\n2\n\n= \xce\xb5 \'f ( 2 N f ) c\n\n\xce\xb5 \'f\n\nfatigue ductility coefficient\n\nc\n\n(3)\n\nfatigue ductility exponent (ranging from \xe2\x80\x930.5~ -0.7)\n\nCombining equations (2) and (3) and substituting into equation (1) gives:\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 total \xcf\x83 \'f\n=\n( 2 N f ) b + \xce\xb5 \'f ( 2 N f ) c\n2\nE\n\n(4)\n\n2.1.2 Universal Slopes method.\xe2\x80\x94Although the Coffin-Manson relation was developed for crack\ninitiation life, Manson, in his paper (ref. 4) shows that this relation can be used to predict life up to actual\nfailure or specimen separation. Based on experimental results obtained from 29 specimens, his results\npropose a modified version of equation (4) for fatigue life prediction. This method is commonly known as\nthe Universal Slopes method and is given by:\n\n\xce\x94\xce\xb5 total = 3.5\n\xcf\x83ult\n\xce\xb5f\n\n\xcf\x83 ult \xe2\x88\x920.12\nNf\n+ \xce\xb5 0.6 N \xe2\x88\x920.6\nf\nf\nE\n\nultimate tensile strength [Pa]\ntrue fracture ductility (from monotonic tensile tests)\n\xce\xb5 f = ln (1 + % elongation\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n79\n\n) or\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b 1 \xe2\x8e\x9e\n\xce\xb5 f = ln\xe2\x8e\x9c\n\xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9d 1 \xe2\x88\x92 RA \xe2\x8e\xa0\n\n(5)\n\nRA\n\narea reduction of stressed component (test specimen)\n\nThis method puts forth average values for the exponents in equation (4), based on experimental results,\nwhich are not specific to any material and can be used at a preliminary design stage life analysis.\nAccordingly, at constant strain, increasing \xcf\x83ult and ductility and decreasing E enhances life. Increasing\nstrain degrades life. In the Manson study, 99.5 percent of the experimental life data falls within a factor of\n20 of the predicted life.\nFor the analysis herein, nickel-base superalloy turbine blade materials, Inconel 625, 706 and Rene 80\nare used where the materials properties are obtained from the technical library from High Temp Metals\nInc. (ref. 5), the Military Handbook (ref. 6) and the Aerospace Structural Metals Handbook (ref. 7). The\ndamped Newton-Rhapson method is used to solve equation (5) for Nf.\n(i) Elastic life: If only the elastic portion of the Universal Slopes method is used, the life estimate can\nbe solved as:\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nNf\n\n\xe2\x8e\x9b \xce\x94\xce\xb5 E \xe2\x8e\x9e 0.12\n= \xe2\x8e\x9c tot \xe2\x8e\x9f\n\xe2\x8e\x9c 3.5\xcf\x83 \xe2\x8e\x9f\nult \xe2\x8e\xa0\n\xe2\x8e\x9d\n\n(5a)\n\nThe life estimate is dependent on the ratio of temperature dependent material properties and the strain\nvalue.\n(ii) Plastic life: Similarly, if only the plastic part of the method is used, the life is evaluated as:\n\nNf =\xce\xb5\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n0. 6\nf ( \xce\x94\xce\xb5 tot )\n\n(5b)\n\nHere, the life estimate is only a function of the ductility and the strain value used.\n2.1.3 Stress level estimation.\xe2\x80\x94In order to obtain life estimates from the Universal Slopes method, the\ntotal strain range imposed on the blade needs to be approximated. The analysis is performed in two ways:\nkeeping the strain level constant and varying temperature dependent material properties as well as by\nvarying the strain level with temperature.\n(i) Total strain range estimation: For the analysis, it is desirable to observe the effects of total strain\nlevels on the life estimates. The total strain is selected such that the respective stress level is limited from\n40 to 80 percent of the ultimate tensile strength at a given temperature level. This corresponds to applying\na design factor of safety of 2.5 to 1.25 respectively. The life cycles to failure are then acquired from\nequation (5), keeping the strain level constant and varying material properties due to temperature changes.\n(ii) Temperature dependent strain range: It is expected that as the operating temperature of the blade\nincreases the stress level increases and there are variations in the total strain as well. These strain\nvariations are expressed through thermal stresses only. This represents in-phase thermo-mechanical\nloading where the thermal and mechanical loads on the part are increased or decreased simultaneously.\nSince the centrifugal stresses are not actually calculated, the thermal stress levels are permitted to be\nhigher than expected such that the total stress level is within a factor of safety of 1.25 to 2.5 of the\nultimate strength.\n(iii) Thermal stresses: The thermal stresses are given by:\n\xcf\x83 th = \xce\xb1E (T \xe2\x88\x92 T )\n\n\xce\xb1 [K\xe2\x80\x931 or R\xe2\x80\x931] is the thermal coefficient of expansion of the blade material and E [MPa or kpsi] is the\nmodulus of elasticity. The thermal stresses arise from local temperature gradients that result in nonuniform expansion causing stresses in the blade.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n80\n\n(6)\n\n3. Material Maintenance Cost Estimation\nIt is common practice to operate at de-rated thrust levels at takeoff as well as during climb in order to\nachieve lower operating temperatures. This usually increases takeoff time, however, the engine\nmaintenance cost benefits generally outweigh the disadvantages. According to a major airline, de-rated\ntakeoffs are performed for 67 to 95 percent of flights depending on factors such as aircraft type and\nweight, weather conditions and runway length, with typical de-rate levels ranging from 5 to 25 percent\n(ref. 1) .\nDe-rated operations result in lowered temperatures in the engine hot section leading to extended\nengine life. Data obtained from an airline company shows maintenance material cost reductions due to derated operations (ref. 8). This data only reflect basic causes for maintenance including FOD, but does not\ninclude negligence or labor costs. De-rate levels can be correlated with reductions in turbine inlet\ntemperature to establish a relationship between cost reductions and turbine inlet temperature. Since water\ninjection also results in lowered turbine inlet temperatures, potential maintenance cost benefits are likely.\nThe airline maintenance cost data is used to estimate cost benefits possible due to water injection.\nIn order to connect de-rate levels to changes in turbine inlet temperature, cycle deck analyses are\nperformed in GasTurb (ref. 2) to observe the influence of several parameters on the off-design\nrelationship between thrust and T4. Different engines cycles are analyzed through GasTurb (ref. 2) by\nvarying critical parameters such as the OPR, BPR, T4, component polytropic efficiencies and the mass\nflow. Linear trendlines are fitted through the cycle deck data obtained. The slope of the trendline for each\ncycle is the ratio of change in the net thrust to change in T4 and has the units of [kN/K]. The average,\nminimum and maximum values of this slope can be determined from the cycle data and used to relate the\n120 \xc2\xb0R change in T4 to a corresponding change in thrust. For a reduction of 120 \xc2\xb0R or 66.67 K in T4 from\nwater injection, the change in thrust is found by:\n\xce\x94 Thrust (de-rate) = (66.67 K) \xc3\x97 (slope kN/K)\n\n(7)\n\nThe percent de-rate is calculated simply by dividing the \xce\x94 Thrust values by the takeoff thrust for each\ncycle and then averaging the results. This percent de-rate is assumed to be the takeoff de-rate and is then\ncombined with the airline data to obtain maintenance cost reductions due to water injection.\n\n4. Results and Discussion\nThe results are presented for low cycle fatigue as obtained from the Universal Slopes method for the\nthree different materials used: Inconel 625, Inconel 706 and Rene 80. The differences in life estimates for\nthe cases of elastic life, plastic life, and total life with constant strain as well as temperature dependent\nstrain are demonstrated for Inconel 625. Results for Inconel 706 and Rene 80 are only shown for the case\nof total life with temperature dependent strain to illustrate the variation in life estimates based on material\nselection. For creep and oxidation life estimates, a brief summary of literature search results is provided.\nCreep-fatigue life estimates are presented for SRR99 (ref. 9) and life estimate variations based on\ntemperatures and stresses are also demonstrated.\nUsing the airline maintenance cost data associated with de-rate levels (ref. 8), potential material\nmaintenance cost benefits from water injection for a 1970\xe2\x80\x99s technology mixed flow turbofan are also\npresented.\n4.1 Fatigue Life Estimate\n\nThe Universal Slopes method was used to determine low cycle fatigue life in the hot section\ncomponents. Owing to a lack of detailed information about the component geometry, loads and operating\nconditions, the life prediction methodology selected was based primarily on material behavior with\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n81\n\nFigure 1.\xe2\x80\x94Young\xe2\x80\x99s modulus vs. temperature.\n\nFigure 2.\xe2\x80\x94Ultimate tensile strength\nvs. temperature\n\nFigure 3.\xe2\x80\x94Ductility vs. temperature.\n\nFigure 4.\xe2\x80\x94Coefficient of thermal\nexpansion vs. temperature.\n\nvarying temperatures. Three different representative alloys were selected for this analysis. Figures 1\nthrough 4 compare the relevant mechanical properties of these materials (refs. 5, 6, and 7).\nThese material properties show similar general trends for varying metal temperature levels with\ndifferences in the actual magnitudes and it is expected that this will be reflected in the life estimates\nobtained.\n4.1.1 Inconel 625.\xe2\x80\x94The life predicted by the Universal Slopes method varies greatly depending on\nseveral factors such as the material used, whether the elastic or plastic portion of the equation is used, the\nstrain levels, strain dependence on metal temperature and so on. Some of these effects are illustrated in\nthe following discussion for Inconel 625.\nFor the material Inconel 625, the elastic and plastic parts of the Universal Slopes method are isolated\nand life is determined for each part. This is done using constant strain values as well as with temperature\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n82\n\ndependent strain. Figures 5 and 6 compare the elastic life prediction based on how the strain range\nis defined.\nBoth plots are subject to similar strain ranges, but in figure 5 the strain is held constant while the\nmaterial properties are varied with temperature. From equation (5a) it is seen that life is function of\nmaterial property ratios and the strain imposed. As a result, all the life ratio curves for the different strains\nused are identical since the ratio of material properties is identical for a given temperature in the elastic\npart of equation for constant strain. For figure 6, the life ratios are different since the strain values vary\nwith temperatures, but the differences are not significant.\nThe most remarkable difference between the two figures is the overall behavior of the life ratio curve\nwith decreasing temperature. In figure 5, the life benefit reaches a maximum around 1600 \xc2\xb0R and then\ndecreases even with decreasing temperature. It appears counterintuitive that life improves at a higher\ntemperature as compared to a lower temperature. This apparent contradiction is better understood if the\nstress levels associated with these strain values are examined. Figures 7 and 8 show the stress levels\ncorresponding to the strains in figures 5 and 6, that are normalized by the ultimate tensile strength of the\nmaterial at the given temperature.\n\nFigure 5.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, elastic life\nestimates with constant.\n\nFigure 6.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, elastic life estimates\nwith strain temperature dependent strain.\n\nFigure 7.\xe2\x80\x94Stress ratios for constrain\nstrain, Inconel 625.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\nFigure 8.\xe2\x80\x94Stress ratios for varying\nstrain, Inconel 625.\n\n83\n\nIt is seen that in the constant strain case, the stress ratio is almost constant at lower temperatures\nand drops around the 1600 \xc2\xb0R temperature level by 0.02 or greater, this results in the life ratio peak in\nfigure 5. There is also a drop in stress ratio in the case of varying strain level as shown in figure 8, but this\ndrop is only about 0.01 and the stress levels increase over all with temperature. This drop in the stress\nratio also results in a small peak in figure 6, but the overall trends are more reasonable than those of\nfigure 5.\nSummarizing elastic behavior, it can be said that stress and strain levels that increase with\ntemperature more accurately describe the physical process expected. For a temperature change of 120 \xc2\xb0R,\nthe elastic life improves anywhere between a factor of 2 to 4.5 depending on the strain level and\ntemperatures for Inconel 625.\nSimilarly, the plastic life was also determined over the same strain ranges using equation (5b) for\nInconel 625. The results are displayed below in figures 9 and 10.\n\nFigure 9.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, plastic life\nestimate with constant strain.\n\nFigure 10.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, plastic life estimate\nwith temperature dependent strain.\n\nFigure 11.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, total life\nestimate with constant strain.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\nFigure 12.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 625, total life estimate\nwith temperature dependent strain.\n\n84\n\nFrom equation (5b) it is seen that the plastic life is simply a function of ductility and strain values.\nTherefore, for constant strain, figure 9 almost resembles the ductility curve for Inconel 625 (fig. 5) and it\nis seen that there are no life benefits from decreasing temperature in the plastic life. However, with the\nstrain values increasing with temperature, there is some life benefit seen at very low temperatures in\nfigure 10, yet still no benefit at elevated temperatures albeit an improvement over constant strain..\nThe same analysis as above is repeated for the complete Universal Slopes method in equation (5),\nwhere the damped Newton-Rhapson method is used to solve equation (5) for Nf. The results are seen to\nstrongly resemble the elastic life curves. It is observed the elastic life parameters dominate the total life of\nthe component in terms of the trends noted.\nSince it is expected that higher strain levels will result is lower life values and will alter the life ratio,\ndifferent strain ranges are investigated. However, the curves follow the same trend and features from the\nelastic life curves are very dominant.\nThe impact of the plastic part of the equation is to reduce the actual values of the life ratios as can be\nseen in the following figures and comparing figure 5 and 6 with figures 11 and 12.\nThe total life benefits now range from a factor of 2 to 3.5 for a temperature reduction of 120 \xc2\xb0R in the\nturbine inlet temperature, depending on the stress levels and temperatures used for Inconel 625.\n4.1.2 Inconel 706 and Rene 80.\xe2\x80\x94Total life estimates with temperature dependent strain are shown\nfor Inconel 706 and Rene 80 in figures 13 and 14. The differences in life estimate behaviors of Inconel\n706, Inconel 625 and Rene 80 primarily arise from variations in material properties.\nThe range of temperatures used for Inconel 706 is narrower than those used for the other materials,\nyet places little limitation on the comparisons for possible turbine applications. These figures can be\ncompared with figure 12 for Inconel 625 to observe the effects of material type on the life estimates\nobtained from the Universal Slopes method. With a 120 \xc2\xb0R reduction in turbine inlet temperature, life\nimproves by a factor of approximately 1.65 for Inconel 706 and by a factor of about 3.5 for Rene 80 as\nseen from figures 13 and 14. In contrast, from figure 12 it is seen that fatigue life improves for Inconel\n625 by a factor of 2 for the same turbine inlet temperature reduction.\nIt is thus clear from these comparisons, that an accurate estimate for life benefits can only be obtained\nwith a detailed analysis using the exact materials, blade geometry, cooling and coatings, temperatures and\nload levels involved in the specified engine type. Life benefits will also be dependent on the statistical\nvalidity of the basis data sets used in the analysis.\n\nFigure 13.\xe2\x80\x94Inconel 706, total life estimate\nwith temperature dependent strain.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\nFigure 14.\xe2\x80\x94Rene 80, total life estimate\nwith temperature dependent strain.\n\n85\n\n4.1.3 Effect of ambient conditions.\xe2\x80\x94There will also be differences in the fatigue life benefits\npossible based on ambient operating conditions. At higher ambient temperatures, T4 levels can be\nexpected to be higher than at cooler ambient temperatures. As seen from figures 12, 13 and 14 the slope\nof the fatigue life ratio curve changes depending on the temperature range concerned; at higher\ntemperatures the life curve slope is steep as compared to lower temperatures where the life curve flattens\nout. This indicates that for the same 120 \xc2\xb0F metal temperature reduction, it is possible for hot operators to\nencounter higher life benefits as compared to cold operators, with little or no benefits.\n4.2 Creep and Oxidation Life Estimates\n\nOwing to the complex interactions between fatigue, creep and oxidation, a detailed life estimate\nanalysis that accounts for component failure due to the combined effects of all the three mechanisms is\nbeyond the scope of this study In order to provide a ballpark estimate for life benefits from water\ninjection, some relevant results found through a literature search are included in this report. Based on\ncommon industry practice (ref. 10), approximations for changes in the first stage turbine blade life\nresulting from changes in gas and metal temperatures as well as centrifugal stresses are shown in table 1.\nTABLE 1.\xe2\x80\x94TURBINE BLADE LIFE ESTIMATE VARIATION\nWITH TEMPERATURE AND STRESSES (REF. 10)\nVariation\n1st Stage Blade\n1st Stage Blade\nCreep-Fatigue life\nOxidation life\nLocal gas temperature\n\xc2\xb1 18 \xc2\xb0R (mean 3600 \xc2\xb0R)\n\n\xc2\xb1 15%\n\n\xc2\xb1 14%\n\nMetal temperature\n\xc2\xb1 5 \xc2\xb0R (mean 1800 \xc2\xb0R)\n\n\xc2\xb1 8%\n\n\xc2\xb1 8%\n\nCentrifugal stresses \xc2\xb1 1%\n\n\xc2\xb1 6%\n\n---\n\nIt can be noted from table 1 that blade life estimates are sensitive to the gas and metal temperature as\nwell as stress levels used in the analysis. With large errors resulting simply from errors in temperature or\nstress levels used, there is a strong need to ensure that accurate data is used in performing such analyses.\nThe combined effects of thermo-mechanical fatigue and creep are usually studied experimentally and then\nmodeled based on the data obtained. The tests include varying thermal and mechanical loads simulating\nin-service working conditions. In a study by S.X. Li and D.J. Smith (ref. 9) the effects of temperature and\ncyclic loading were investigated on a single crystal nickel base superalloy, SRR99. The tests are carried\nout at 750 \xc2\xb0C (1842 \xc2\xb0R) and 1050 \xc2\xb0C (2382 \xc2\xb0R). The specimens were exposed to three different loading\nconditions, continuous cycling (denoted as 0/0), cycling with a tensile dwell, (t/0) and with a compressive\ndwell, (0/t). The tensile and compressive dwells were imposed to study crack initiation and propagation\nunder combined fatigue and creep loading; the dwells were at constant strain for 2 minutes.\nThe results for crack initiation life and propagation rates are shown in figures 15 and 16 for both\ntemperatures tested. Assuming tensile strains are more dominant in the case of turbine blades, from figure\n15 it can be noted that under tensile strain dwells, crack initiation life decreases as testing temperature\nincreases. For approximately similar normalized strain levels, the crack initiation life changes from about\n3000 to 5000 cycles for 750 \xc2\xb0C (1842 \xc2\xb0R) to around 200 to 400 cycles for 1050 \xc2\xb0C (2382 \xc2\xb0R). Similarly,\ncrack propagation rates increase with increasing temperature for tensile strain dwells as noted in figure\n16. Notably, the total strain range imposed at higher temperatures is less than that used at lower\ntemperatures in order to observe the crack propagation behavior prior to complete failure. For 750 \xc2\xb0C\n(1842 \xc2\xb0R), propagation rates are about 0.0005 to 0.001mm/cycle; they increase by an order of magnitude\nto 0.0025 \xe2\x80\x930.004 mm/cycle at 1050 \xc2\xb0C (2382 \xc2\xb0R). In figures 15 and 16, the triangles correspond to tensile\nstrain dwells.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n86\n\nThus, under tensile strain loads, the results of this study demonstrate that for alloy SRR99 crack\ninitiation life decreases and crack propagation rates increase by an order of magnitude when the testing\ntemperature is increased from 750 \xc2\xb0C (1842 \xc2\xb0R) to 1050 \xc2\xb0C (2382 \xc2\xb0R). Along with temperature and\nmechanical load effects, properties of the base alloys and coating materials involved are also deciding\nfactors in the interactions between the different failure mechanisms. The protective coatings or the\nthermal barrier coatings (TBCs) impact the mechanical properties of the base alloy as well. The protective\ncoatings are designed to shield the base material from environmental attacks and the TBCs reduce the\neffective temperature seen by the alloy. Due to the difference in material properties between the coatings\nand base materials, such as coefficients of thermal expansion, tensile and compressive stresses are\nimposed on the coatings. Creep and cyclic loading result in cracking and spalling of the coatings exposing\nthe alloys to higher temperatures and corrosive environments. Environmental effects can be incorporated\ninto the crack propagation models for the coatings and can be experimentally validated.\n\nFigure 15.\xe2\x80\x94Influence of strain dwells and temperature\non crack initiation life for SRR99 (ref. 9).\n\nFigure 16.\xe2\x80\x94Influence of strain dwells and temperature\non crack propagation for SRR99 (ref. 9).\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n87\n\nIt can be seen that this analysis is strongly dependent on the material properties and temperature and\nstress-strain ranges. Using Inconel 625 as a representative material, the fatigue life benefits range\nanywhere from a factor of 2 to 4.5 for a 120 \xc2\xb0R change in turbine inlet temperature, depending on the\ndetails of the parameters applied. Owing to the lack of detailed knowledge of the blade geometry, loads,\noperating temperatures and temperature gradients, the level of this analysis are confined to a generic\napproach to predict overall trends in life. Consequently, the Universal Slopes method is used, which was\ndeveloped from average values of material constants from experimental data available. In addition to the\nlimitations arising from the lack of detailed data, there are also some notable shortcomings in the\napplication of the Universal Slopes method. The coefficients used in equation (5) are obtained through\nisothermal, room temperature fatigue tests done on a wide range of materials. As shown in the Manson\nreport (ref. 4), these average coefficients provide fairly reliable life estimates for the 29 materials tested\nwith 99.5 percent of the experimental data falling within a factor of 20 of the predicted life. However, life\nestimates obtained under thermo-mechanical fatigue (TMF) can vary significantly from those obtained\nfrom isothermal low cycle fatigue. Under in-service conditions, turbine blades are exposed to widely\nvarying thermo-mechanical loads and simplified isothermal models do not capture the complexity of the\nsituation. The deviation of isothermal results from TMF results depends largely on the material properties\nand the nature of the TMF cycle. The primary reason for the use of the Universal Slopes method in this\nanalysis was the ease involved in its use and availability of the necessary material data. Regardless of the\nlimitations involved, this method is an appropriate tool for a preliminary design level analysis where the\noverall trends in life behavior are sought.\nIn order to enhance the accuracy of the method, these material constants would have to be determined\nexperimentally for the material in question. Other methods that predict life more accurately can also be\nused if more data are available that also account for the interactions between the different failure\nmechanisms, namely creep, oxidation and fatigue. Effects of creep can be incorporated into the crack\npropagation analysis mentioned previously. It is difficult to capture the effects of oxidation in a generic\nstudy like this since details about the nature of the protective coatings and their impacts on the base alloy\nare complex phenomena. Despite the shortcomings of the methods applied in this study, it can be said\nwith confidence that improvement in turbine blade life is expected. The exact range of possible life\nextension depends on the details of the parameters involved.\n4.3 Material Maintenance Cost Benefits\n\nMaintenance cost data was obtained from an airline for a typical 1970\xe2\x80\x99s technology engine showing\neffects of de-rated operations and flight duration. In order to extract maintenance cost estimates for water\ninjection from this data, T4 reductions from de-rated operations had to be related to changes in T4 resulting\nfrom water injection. This was accomplished by plotting full throttle curves for several cycles for a single,\ntypical 1970\xe2\x80\x99s technology mixed flow turbofan engine as shown in figures 17 through 21.\nFigures 17 through 21 show several different engines cycles analyzed through GasTurb (ref. 2) by\nvarying critical parameters such as the OPR, BPR, T4, component polytropic efficiencies and the mass\nflow. Thus, the relationship between thrust and turbine inlet temperature is established and based on this\nfirst order analysis it is seen that the throttle curves are not very sensitive to changes in most of the key\nparameters. Table 2 shows the average, maximum and minimum values of the slope of the linear fits to\nthe cycle deck data. From equation (7) it is seen that these slopes relate the ratios of change in the net\nthrust to change in T4 with units of [kN/K]. Also indicated in table 2 are the percent de-rate values\ncorresponding to the average, minimum and maximum values of the slope for a change in T4 of 120 \xc2\xb0R\nfrom water injection.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n88\n\n200\n180\n\n(OPR=10) y = 0.2148x - 153.53\n(OPR=18) y = 0.208x - 149.69\n\n160\n\n(OPR=14) y = 0.2133x - 152.82\n(OPR=22) y = 0.2032x - 149.55\n\nNet Thrust [kN]\n\n140\n120\n100\n\nOPR=10\nOPR=14\nOPR=18\nOPR=22\nLinear (OPR=10)\nLinear (OPR=14)\nLinear (OPR=18)\nLinear (OPR=22)\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\nT4 [K]\n\nFigure 17.\xe2\x80\x94Net thrust vs. T4 for varying OPR, spool speeds 0.75 to 1.15,\ndesign point: BPR = 4.5, m = 500 kg/s, T4 = 1200 K, polytropic efficiency = 0.9.\n200\n180\n\n(BPR=3.5) y = 0.2231x - 159.04\n(BPR=4.0) y = 0.2161x - 156.51\n\n160\n\n(BPR=4.5) y = 0.205x - 151.28\n\nNet Thrust [kN]\n\n140\n120\n100\n80\nBPR=3.5\nBPR=4.0\nBPR=4.5\nLinear (BPR=3.5)\nLinear (BPR=4.0)\nLinear (BPR=4.5)\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\nT4 [K]\n\nFigure 18.\xe2\x80\x94Net thrust vs. T4 for varying BPR, spool speeds 0.75 to 1.15,\ndesign point: OPR = 22, m = 500 kg/s, T4 = 1200 K, polytropic efficiency = 0.9.\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n89\n\n1800\n\n180\n\n160\n\n(T4=1200K) y = 0.205x - 151.29\n(T4=1250K) y = 0.206x - 152.2\n\n140\n\n(T4=1300K) y = 0.2068x - 156.31\n\nNet Thrust [kN]\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\nT4=1200K\n\n60\n\nT4=1250K\nT4=1300K\nLinear (T4=1200K)\n\n40\n\nLinear (T4=1250K)\nLinear (T4=1300K)\n\n20\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\nT4 [K]\n\nFigure 19.\xe2\x80\x94Net thrust vs. T4 for varying T4, spool speeds 0.75 to 1.15,\ndesign point: OPR = 22, m = 500 kg/s, BPR = 4.5, polytropic efficiency = 0.9.\n200\n180\n\n(poly=0.92) y = 0.2122x - 149.98\n(poly=0.91) y = 0.2106x - 151.96\n\n160\n\n(poly=0.9) y = 0.205x - 151.28\n\nNet Thrust [kN]\n\n140\n120\n100\n80\npoly=0.9\npoly=0.91\npoly=0.92\nLinear (poly=0.92)\nLinear (poly=0.91)\nLinear (poly=0.9)\n\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\nT4 [K]\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\nFigure 20.\xe2\x80\x94Net thrust vs. T4 for varying polytropic efficiency, spool speeds 0.75 to 1.15,\ndesign point: BPR = 4.5, m = 500 kg/s, T4 = 1200 K, OPR = 22.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n90\n\n250\n\n(m=700) y = 0.2867x - 211\n\n200\n\n(m=500) y = 0.205x - 151.28\n\nNet Thrust [kN]\n\n(m=300) y = 0.1276x - 96.748\n\n150\n\n100\n\nmass=300\nmass=500\nmass=700\nLinear (mass=700)\nLinear (mass=500)\nLinear (mass=300)\n\n50\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\nT4 [K]\n\nFigure 21.\xe2\x80\x94Net thrust vs. T4 for varying mass flow, spool speeds 0.75 to 1.15,\ndesign point: BPR = 4.5, OPR = 22, T4 = 1200 K, polytropic efficiency = 0.9\n\nTABLE 2.\xe2\x80\x94AVERAGE, MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM VALUES\nOF THE THRUST DE-RATE FROM WATER INJECTION\nSlope [kN/K]\n% De-rate\nMIN\n0.13\n5.1\nAVG\n0.21\n8.4\nMAX\n0.29\n11.5\n\nIt is seen that depending on the engine cycle data used, the percent de-rate value corresponding to\nwater injection can range from 5.1 to 11.5 percent. The cost benefits resulting from the equivalent water\ninjection thrust de-rate are calculated based on the airline maintenance material cost data mentioned\npreviously. This data includes maintenance material costs per engine flight hour for basic causes as well\nas FOD but does not cover the associated labor costs. Only the effects of takeoff de-rate caused by water\ninjection are evaluated in this analysis. Table 3 shows the percent reduction material maintenance costs\nper engine flight hour (MMC/EFH) in 2004 dollars for three different flight lengths as well as for the\ndifferent takeoff de-rate values discussed previously. It is seen that costs decrease with increasing flight\ntime which is expected since longer flight times indicate that a small portion of the flight is spent at\ncritical takeoff level temperatures. Costs also decrease with increasing de-rate levels, since this reduces\neffective operating temperature.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n91\n\nTABLE 3.\xe2\x80\x94PERCENT REDUCTION IN MMC/EFH IN 2004 DOLLARS\nFOR A RANGE OF TAKEOFF DE-RATES AND FLIGHT LENGTHS\nT.O. de-rate\n1 hour\n6 hour\n12 hour\n(%)\n% change\n% change\n% change\n5\n8.4\n11.5\n\n10.43\n16.52\n20.87\n\n6.06\n9.09\n10.61\n\n1.90\n2.86\n3.81\n\nThus, it can be seen that maintenance material cost benefits are possible from a T4 reduction of\n120 \xc2\xb0R (66.67 K) from water injection. The actual benefits possible depend on the flight length and values\nof de-rate corresponding to the T4 reduction obtained from the engine cycle deck. It is important to note\nthat this analysis only represents a single engine. However, the results are significant in that for this\nengine a narrow range of possible reductions in cost can be presented with confidence. Clearly, this\nmethod of assessing costs relies primarily on data available from industry. A greater level of confidence\ncan be placed in the results if the engine in question can be simulated in a more advanced cycle deck than\nGasTurb (ref. 2). Since the throttle curves didn\xe2\x80\x99t show much variation with changes in cycle parameters,\nthis study provides a good preliminary estimate of cost benefits from water injection.\n\n5. Future Work and Conclusions\nThe results presented in this study have only addressed the effects of varying loads and temperatures\non the turbine fatigue life in some detail. The Universal Slopes method was used to obtain life estimates\nwithout any specific or detailed information about the component or operating conditions. This enabled\nthe results of the study to be broad and generic, not limited to any particular type of engine or load cycle.\nThe life estimate methodology was primarily from a materials point of view since detailed component\ninformation was not available for the analysis. The sensitivity of the results obtained to both strain values\nand material properties used was tested and it was found that life in general does not continuously\ndecrease with increasing temperature. For Inconel 625, life improvements ranging from a factor of 2 to\n4.5 can be expected for a 120 \xc2\xb0R change in turbine inlet temperature, depending on the stress-strain levels\nand temperatures. Similarly, life improves by a factor of approximately 1.65 for Inconel 706 and by a\nfactor of about 3.5 for Rene 80 under thermally varying strains with the same turbine inlet temperature\nreduction. Effects of creep and oxidation on blade life are presented in brief based on a literature search.\nLife estimates can show large variations due to changes in temperatures and stresses. It is seen that for\nalloy SRR99, crack initiation life decreases and crack propagation rates increase by an order of magnitude\nfor a temperature increase of 300 \xc2\xb0C (540 \xc2\xb0R). Given additional detailed data on load conditions and\noperating temperatures, other methodologies that provide a more accurate analysis can be employed.\nBased on airline data and engine cycle deck analyses, the results from this study show that water\ninjection may yield maintenance cost benefits similar to those achieved from de-rated operations. Both\nwater injection and de-rated operations result in lowered engine temperatures, effectively extending part\nlife and reducing material maintenance costs. This analysis was carried out for a specific 1970\xe2\x80\x99s\ntechnology mixed flow turbofan engine owing to the availability of airline data. From results of this\nstudy, it seen that cost benefits increase with decreasing flight duration. Higher de-rate levels\ncorresponding to greater reductions in operating temperatures also yield increase benefits. Enhanced\nfidelity engine and flight cycle-deck analysis along with more detailed costing benefits may be warranted,\nyet will be more demanding of statistically significant operational data.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942005-213656\n\n92\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Professor Mark Spearing and Dr. Philippa Reed from the University\nof Southampton, UK, for their help and guidance in the turbine life section.\n\nReferences\n1.

Using a 1:1 water-to-fuel ratio,\nNOx is reduced 80 percent during takeoff and turbine inlet temperature would be reduced 120 \xc2\xb0F (67 K), which may\nimprove life 29 percent for a PW4062 engine. Performance penalties include a 750 lb weight increase, 1.2 percent\nhigh-pressure compressor surge margin deterioration and loss of range and payload. For a newly designed airplane,\nthe potential engine maintenance savings may offset penalties to save an operator up to 1 percent in operating costs.\nFor existing aircraft, high development and testing and certification costs would make retrofit kits cost prohibitive.\n\n14.
