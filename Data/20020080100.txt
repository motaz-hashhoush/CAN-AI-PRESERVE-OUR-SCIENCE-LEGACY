b'Environment and Resources Management\n\n=\n\nBroadening the Earthscan Industry\n\nR\n\nAmong envir\ntransfers is a NASAIprivate sl\npartnership effort to expand\ncommercial remote sensing\nJ\n\nemote sensing is the process of acquiring physical information from\na distance, for example, obtaining data on Earth features from sensors aboard satellites or aircraft. These sensors detect various\ntypes of radiations emitted by or reflected from objects on Earth\nnd, because each object has its own special "signature," the data\ncan be interpreted to tell the difference between one kind of vegetation and\nanother for example, or between clear and polluted water, or between densely\npopulated urban areas and lightly populated farmland.\nThis type of information is being put to practical use in agricultural crop\nforecasting, land-use management, water quality evaluation, mineral and petroleum exploration, rangeland and forest management, and scores of other applications. Users of remotely sensed data are supported by a small but growing\nindustry that provides computer processing, data analysis and interpretation\nservices.\nNASA seeks to accelerate the growth of this "Earthscan" industry because\nexpansion of commercial remote sensing offers broad economic potential for the\nnation. Among a number of mechanisms designed to promote remote sensing is\nthe Visiting Investigator Program (VIP) managed by Stennis Space Center.\nVIP is directed toward small companies who might be able to use remote\nsensing profitably in their businesses but who do not have much money to invest\nin exploring new technologies. VIP costs them nothing but their own employees1\ntravel expenses. A prospective VIP participant submits a proposal involving use\nof remote sensing in an actual project. If the proposal is accepted, Stennis\nSpace Center acquires the remote sensing data, provides instruction in the use\nof remote sensing software and hardware, and guidance in executing the project.\nIt\'s a low risk opportunity for companies to develop new capabilities they can\nmarket.\nAn example of a VIP project is the work of Law Environmental, Inc.,\nKennesaw, Georgia, a professional engineering and Earth sciences consulting\nfirm. Law proposed a VIP project in which remote sensing would be applied to\none phase of a broad environmental assessment the company was undertaking\nfor a client. The client operates an electricity generating plant near Panama\nCity, Florida that draws in cooling saltwater from one point in adjacent St.\nAndrews Bay and releases a heated water discharge into another part of the bay.\nLaw\'s study was intended to evaluate the effects of the heated discharge on local\naquatic life. Stennis Space Center provided the remote sensing data that enabled\nLaw to produce images of the thermal "plume," the water area affected by the\nheated discharge. The plume\'s shape, the area it covered and the distribution of\nsurface temperatures were determined under the "worst case" conditions of\nsummer, low water level (low tide) and high water level (high tide). After the\nplume information was gathered, Law studied selected plant and animal life in\n\nST. ANDREW BAY, FLORIDA\nY\n\'LUME GWTERISTlCS\nF R ENCLOSED ARE4\nO\n\nThis image shows the actual temperatures\nof heated water being discharged into a\nFlorida bay from a generating plant. It\nwas part of a broader study of the power\nplant\'s impact on plant and animal life in\nthe bay, conducted in a NASA program to\nhelp private firms capitalize on the potential of commercial remote sensing.\n\nthe discharge area for comparison with similar life in an unaffected control area.\nLaw was able to conclude that the plant and animal life were not substantially\naffected by the generating plant\'s heated discharge.\nVIP gave Law Environmental hands-on experience in a technology new to\ncompany employees and increased Law\'s competitiveness by adding remote\nsensing to the company\'s conventional ecological assessment techniques. Law\nhas since conducted a number of commercial remote sensing projects.\nA similar beneficial result was reported by Subra Company, Inc., New Iberia,\nLouisiana, a company that offers commercial environmental studies and analytical services. Under the VIP program, Subra teamed with Stennis to develop software models for tracking the impact of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Point\nsource pollution is typically discharge from industrial facilities through pipes or\nconduits; NPS pollution is transported by water movement over land, the "runoff"\nthat picks up pollutants and carries them into rivers, lakes, wetlands and ground\nwater. Cities with populations above 100,000 are now required to identify NPS\nand take steps to control it, but tracking NPS by conventional means is a labor\nintensive job involving a lot of field study.\nWith Stennis\' help, Subra analyzed a test area in Calcasieu River Basin,\nLouisiana, using satellite data to produce a land cover classification of the whole\narea as a first step. Subra added data on soil permeability, elevation, slope,\nhydrography, drainage basins and NPS locations to make a complete remote\nsensinglgeographic information system that can be used by government agencies\nfor planning pollution control actions. In VIP, Subra learned how to use remc~tely\nsensed data to compress the time required for a difficult task and thus expanded\nits range of expertise; the company is now offering technical services based on\nremote sensing to industrial clients.\nBy April 1994, 24 companies had participated in Stennis Space Center\'s\nVIP; as a result of their VIP experiences, 13 companies had developed new piloducts or services.\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nA composite image rates the impact ofnon-\n\npoint pollution sources, such as rain runoff,\n\n~~i~~I~~f\nimpact areas, yellow/red high impact apeas).\nThe study project gave a Louisiana company\nvaluable hands-on experience in applying\nremotely sensed data.\n\n'
