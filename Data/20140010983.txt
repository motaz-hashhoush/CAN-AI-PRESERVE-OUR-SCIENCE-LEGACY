Increasing numbers of these\nvery small spacecraft are being launched as secondary payloads, dramatically decreasing\ncosts, and allowing greater access to operations and experimentation using actual space\nflight systems. While manifesting as a secondary payload provides inexpensive rides to\norbit, these arrangements also have certain limitations. Small, secondary payloads are\ntypically included with very limited payload accommodations, supported on a non\ninterference basis (to the prime payload), and are delivered to orbital conditions driven by\nthe primary launch customer. Integration of propulsion systems or other hazardous\ncapabilities will further complicate secondary launch arrangements, and accommodation\nrequirements.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center has\nbegun work on the development of small, low cost launch system concepts that could\nprovide dedicated, affordable launch alternatives to small, risk tolerant university type\npayloads and spacecraft. These efforts include development of small propulsion systems\nand highly optimized structural efficiency, utilizing modern advanced manufacturing\ntechniques. This paper outlines the plans and accomplishments of these efforts and\ninvestigates opportunities for truly revolutionary reductions in launch and operations\ncosts. Both evolution of existing sounding rocket systems to orbital delivery, and the\ndevelopment of clean sheet, optimized small launch systems are addressed.\nA launch vehicle at the scale and price point which allows developers to take reasonable\nrisks with new propulsion and avionics hardware solutions does not exist today.\nEstablishing this service provides a ride through the proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cvalley of death\xe2\x80\x9d that lies\nbetween demonstration in laboratory and flight environments. This effort will provide\nthe framework to mature both on-orbit and earth-to-orbit avionics and propulsion\ntechnologies while also providing dedicated, affordable access to LEO for cubesat class\npayloads.\n\n'
