It was employed in a series of experiments to determine the practicability of matching left and right images of a scene to determine the range and form of objects. The experiments started with computer generated random-dot stereograms as inputs and progressed through random square stereograms to a real scene. The major problems were the elimination of spurious matches, between the left and right views, and the interpretation of ambiguous regions, on the left side of an object that can be viewed only by the left camera, and on the right side of an object that can be viewed only by the right camera.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730019204, "id": "5a5421b7d08e43fcb68e9789f83b7199", "publicationDate": "1973-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730019204.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730019204/downloads/19730019204.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730019204/downloads/19730019204.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730019204/downloads/19730019204.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
