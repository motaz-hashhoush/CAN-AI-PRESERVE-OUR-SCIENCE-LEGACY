A multiple beam offset feed cluster used in conjunction with an offset parabolic reflector was chosen for the antenna realization. For radiating elements in the feed array, polyrod or dielectric rod radiators fed by waveguide are investigated. Polyrod antennas shrink the cross section of the waveguide required, are fairly directive, and can be tapered to reduce sidelobes. As a consequence, it is thought that mutual coupling effects between adjacent elements will be minimal and the resultant physically small elements will allow greater packing densities for the drive elements in the feed array than would otherwise be possible.", "title": "Shaped Beam KU-Band Antenna Design", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T06:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19730006214, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dudgeon, J.
