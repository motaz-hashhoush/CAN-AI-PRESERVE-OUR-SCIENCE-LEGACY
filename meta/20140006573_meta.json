The dormant period might be especially long, for example during missions to the moon or Mars. In missions with long dormant periods the risk incurred during dormancy can exceed the active risk contribution. Probabilistic Risk Assessments (PRAs) need to account for the dormant risk contribution as well as the active contribution. A typical method for calculating a dormant failure rate is to multiply the active failure rate by a constant, the dormancy factor. For example, some practitioners use a heuristic and divide the active failure rate by 30 to obtain an estimate of the dormant failure rate. To obtain a more empirical estimate of the dormancy factor, this paper uses the recently updated database NPRD-2011 [1] to arrive at a set of distributions for the dormancy factor. The resulting dormancy factor distributions are significantly different depending on whether the item is electrical, mechanical, or electro-mechanical. Additionally, this paper will show that using a heuristic constant fails to capture the uncertainty of the possible dormancy factors.", "title": "Using Generic Data to Establish Dormancy Failure Rates", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2014-06-03T08:36:29.0770000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20140006573, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reistle, Bruce"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "6f64133dbbe74365aa79e9b162b1cb05"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20140006573, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140006573, "id": "b04b0eacae154891baa367ad76386f62", "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20150006972, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Using Generic Data to Establish Dormancy Failure Rates", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140006573.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140006573/downloads/20140006573.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140006573/downloads/20140006573.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140006573/downloads/20140006573.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
