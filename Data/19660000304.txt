Conventional methods of identification\ngenerally require the destruction of a small sample of\nthe metal and are relatively slow, complex, and expensive.\nThe solution:\n\nMeasure the characteristic potential difference produced by galvanic reaction between a reference electrode and the test metal, using a drop of water as an\nelectrolyte.\nHow it's done:\n\nConnect two copper leads to an X-Y recorder or a\nvoltmeter having an input impedance between 5 x 105\nand 5 x 10 6 ohms. One of the leads is connected to a\nreference electrode (made of platinum, silver, or other\nsuitable metal), which is then dipped into a drop of\nwater (resistivity less than 10 4 ohms/cc) on a clean\nsurface of the metal to be identified. This electrode\nmust not contact the test surface. The other lead is\nplaced in contact with a point on the clean test surface near the drop of water. The voltage magnitude,\npolarity, and decay characteristics read from the measuring instrument are then recorded and compared\n\nwith the corresponding values obtained when a metal\nof known composition is substituted for the test metal\nand measured under the same conditions. If the two\nsets of values are equal, the composition of the test\nmetal is identical to that of the standard.\nNotes:\n\n1. The test can readily be made on components\nmounted in an assembly.\n2. This method would be most useful as a go, no-go\ntest in establishing whether a specified metal has\nbeen used in a component.\n3.
