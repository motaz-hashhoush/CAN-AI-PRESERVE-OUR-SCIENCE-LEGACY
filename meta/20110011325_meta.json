It offers several challenges for Service Science and Service Innovation. the goal of the presentation is to stimulate thinking about how service systems viII evolve in the future, as human society advances from its terrestrial base toward a permanent presence in space. First we will consider the complexity of the International Space Station (ISS) as it is today, with particular emphasis of its research facilities, and focus on a current challenge - to maximize the utilization of ISS research facilities for the benefit of society. After briefly reviewing the basic principles of Service Science, we will discuss the potential application of Service Innovation methodology to this challenge. Then we viII consider how game-changing technologies - in particular Synthetic Biology - could accelerate the pace of sociocultural evolution and consequently, the progression of human society into space. We will use this provocative vision to advance thinking about how the emerging field of Service Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME) might help us anticipate and better handle the challenges of this inevitable evolutionary process.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20110011325, "endDate": "2010-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Japanese Society of Artificial Intelligence International", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "meetingId": "3043c365a73c4cef9fb60af362f0d85a", "id": "136fb1bd109c411fb9fed85a7cf96d24"}], "name": "JSAI International Symposia on AI 2010", "location": "Tokyo", "id": "3043c365a73c4cef9fb60af362f0d85a", "startDate": "2010-11-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110011325, "id": "5be30ce3f7614ea89a56f31000e26b61", "publicationDate": "2010-11-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110011325.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110011325/downloads/20110011325.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110011325/downloads/20110011325.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110011325/downloads/20110011325.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
