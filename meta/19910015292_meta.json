However, this target was much more massive than any other previously inherited design applications. The target experienced unacceptable bounce when reaching its stops. Without any design modification, the momentum generated by the driver caused the target to bounce back to its starting position. Initially, elastomeric dampers were used between the driver and the target. However, this design could not prevent the bounce, and it compromised the positional accuracy of the calibration target. A design that successfully met all the requirements incorporated a sealed pocket 85 percent full of 0.75 mm diameter stainless steel balls in the back of the target to provide the effect of a dead-blow hammer. The energy dissipation resulting from the collision of balls in the pocket successfully dampened the excess momentum generated during the target deployment. The disastrous effects of new requirements on a design with a successful flight history, the modifications that were necessary to make the device work, and the tests performed to verify its functionality are described.", "title": "Dead-blow hammer design applied to a calibration target mechanism to dampen excessive rebound", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910015292, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lim, Brian Y."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2bf68dcf7e7243f486b992c2c36282fd"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910015292, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910015292, "id": "95d4fe4d9e7c45d2a33e11513aa5bd43", "publicationName": "The 25th Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium", "publicationDate": "1991-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910015292.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910015292/downloads/19910015292.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910015292/downloads/19910015292.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910015292/downloads/19910015292.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
