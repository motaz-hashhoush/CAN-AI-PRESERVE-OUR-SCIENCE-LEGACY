As an example of the\nextreme sensitivity required of a micrometeoroid detector\nand achieved by the present invention, a transducer constructed according to the invention is sensitive t o forces\nof the order of a microgram, or momentum of the order\nof 10-5 dyne seconds. The degree of sensitivity is even\nmore fully understood when it is realized that a momentum of 10-5 dyne seconds is equal to %ooo of the\nmomentum achieved by a grain of table salt weighing\n150x10-6 grams when dropped from a height of %".\nAn additional object of the invention is to provide\na transducer capable of nleasuting impact or pulse forces\napplied against a target and at the same time capable\nof measuring acceleration. Accordingly, a transducer\nconstructed according to the invention is usable as an\naccelerometer and as a seismograph in addition to being\nusable as a micrometeoroid detector.\nA further object of the iniiention is to provide a transducer and method of using the same which makes it\npossible to calibrate the device remotely, such as from\nearth to an unmanned space vehicle in flight.\nIn connection with use as a micrometeoroid detector\nor detection of other scattered impacts, an object of the\ninvention is to provide a transducer having a target area\nand atranged so that the device has uniform sensitivity\nover the entire target area so that impact of a given\nmomentum will give the same recording regardless of\nwhere on the target impact takes place. Also in connection with momentum measurement a further object of\nthe invention is to provide a transducer having a target\nconstructed to give a momentum acconlmodation coefficient of one so that momentum transfer efficiency is\nwell established.\nAdditional objects of the invention are to provide a\ntransducer having the following features which make it\ncapable of performing a wide variety of uses. One feature is that the device be operable under gravitational\nforce; another featuie is that the device have a lapid\ndecay time after impact to allow measurement of sepalate impacts in close sequence. An additional featule\nis that the device be sufficiently rugged to withstand\nhigh g loads during off-design conditions. A further\nfeaturn is that the device have a high degree of stability\nfor long periods of time. An additional feature is that\nthe device be calibratible in the laboratory under 1 g\nconditions.\nAnother feature of the invention is to provide a transducer which will be capable of detecting and recording\nboth the magnitude and the direction of force.\n\n,,9\n\n,,\n,,\n\na?\nBy way of brief description, a transducer according\nto one specific embodiment of the invention, conlprisei\na base plate with a support post extending upwardly\ntherefrom. A pair of piezoelectric beams are nlounted\n5 one above the other in rigid attachment to the support\npost. A movable member is connected to the free ends\nof the beams and transmits to the beams the force which\nis to be detected and measured. Bending of the beams\nby the movement of said movable member generates\n10 an electrical output and the magnitude of that output is\na measurement of the amount of movement of the movable member and therefore the amonnt of force which\nwas transmitted to the movable member.\nThe preceding objects and features of advantage, to15 gether with others, will become more clea~lyapparent\nfrom the following detailed description, wherein reference\nin\nis made to the accompanying d~awings which:\nFIGURE 1 is a side elevational view of a transducer\naccording to the invention;\n20\nFIGURE 2 is essentially a top view on the line 2-2\nof FIG. 1 with part of the base plate cut away;\nFIGURE 3 is a cross-sectional view taken on the line\n3-3 of FIG. 2 showing the details of a locking and\nlimit arangement;\n26\nFIGURE 4 is an enlarged view of one of the pjezoelectric beams and a suitable electrical connection thereto;\nFIGURE 5 is a side view similar to FIG. 1 but showing the motion of the transducer in operation, and also\n3O containing a schematic showing of a connection for utilizing the built-in calibration feature of the transducer;\nFIGURE 6 is a side view similar to FIG. 1 but showing a modified embodiment of the invention, and also\nshowing motion of the modified embodiment;\n36\nFIGURE 7 is a top view on reduced scale of FIG. 6\nand showing the addition of a tethering arrangement which\nis desirable for some applications;\nFIGURE 8 is a perspective view showinlg an arrangement similar to the transducer of FIG. 1 but having two\n40 sets of support beans;\nFIGURE 9 is a perspective view which omits the base\nplate and shows an arrangement for detecting and measuring forces along two axes;\nFIGURE 10 is an end view of a portion of the trans45 ducer of FIG. 9, looking toward the support post;\nFIGURE 11 is a perspective view similar to FIG. 9\nbut showing an arrangement for detecting and measuring\nforces along three axes; and\nFIGURE 12 is an elevational view of a portion of the\n50 transducer of FIG. 11 looking along the X-X axis.\nReferring in more detail to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows\na transducer 1 comprising a base plate 2 supported on\nlegs 3. The transducer has a support post 4 which is\n55 rigidly mounted on the base plate and is held in place\nbj7 bolts 5. The movable member of the transducer is\ndesignated generally at 8 and con~prisesan attachment\nrod portion 9 having an attachment head PO. In FIG. 1\na collector or target plate 11 is mounted on the attachment\nhead. The target plate 11 nlay be removed or replaced\nby other units depending upoi~the desired use of the\ntransducer. The target plate is employed plimarily when\nthe transducer is u5ed to iecord m~crometeoriodor similar inlpacrs.\nThe movable member and, in particular, the target 11\n" must be .iery rigid to give unifornl sensitivity for impact\nanywhere on the target surface. In addition the mass\nof the entire n~ovablemember must be low to insure high\nsensitivity and mpid decay. One suitable construction is\nto make the entire target element 11 out of metal honeycomb employing a light-weight metal such as aluminum,\nnlaguesium or beryllium and arranging the honeycomb\n\n3,304,773\n\n3\n\n4\n\npassages vertically.

When the apIn order to provide the apparatus with its feature of\nparatus is to be employed to detect and measure microruggedness, a stop member 35 is attached to the suppo~t\nmeteoroid and similar impacts it is desirable to coat the 5 post 4 by means of screws 36. The stop member 35 is\nsurface of the target with a layer 12 of plastic such as\nprovided with a bore 37 which reseives the attachment\npolyethylene. The reason for the plastic coating is that\nrod 9 of the movable member 8. Bore 37 is substantially\nit has been found that such a coating improves the energy\noversized for the rod 9 so as not to interfere with vertical\ntransfer and provides a momentum accommodation comotion of rod 9 when the apparatus is in use.

One q5 source 42 to the wires 28 and 29 of one of the beams\nsuitable wiring arrangement is shown in FIG. 4 for one\nthrough leads 43 and 44. The so-tlrce 42 may, for exof the beams. More specifically, electrodes 19 and 22\nample, generate an A.-C. voltage, a constant D.-C. voltare connected together by a wire 28, and electrodes 20\nage, or a series of pulses.

As is well known in the\nand 29 can then be connected by leads 30 and 31 to a 50 art, the piezoelectric beams 14 and 15 can be used to\nconventional amplifier 32. Electrodes 19-22 can obvigenerate voltage by physical displacement or conversely\nously be connected to the amplifier in different ways than\ncan be displaced by voltage input.\nshown in FIG. 4. The arrangement shown in FIG. 4\nThis phenomenon is employed in the calibration techwas selected to provide a large capacitance into the amnique wherein the beam 15 is charged with a known voltplifier. Although the output of both of the beams 14 55 age potential. When a constant D.-C, voltage is used for\nand 15 can be connected to the amplifier, very satisfactory\ncalibration, it physically deflects the system including the\nresults have been obtained using the output of only one\nmovable member 8 to a fixed position and holds it there as\nof the beams.\nlong as the potential is maintained. The initial deflection\nFIG. 5 shows the type of motion experienced by the\nof the system will, of course, bend the beam 14 and cause\ntransducer under impact and in addition provides a sche- 60 a votage output which is a direct measurement of the\nmatic showing for an arrangement whereby the built-in\namount of displacement of the movable member. Thus,\ncalibration feature of the apparatus can be employed. As\nvoltage output can be plotted against voltage input. Upon\nshown in FIG. 5 the movable member 8 follows a straight\ndischarge of the input voltage the system will vibrate.\nline motion due to the pantograph-like nature of the strucThis physical vibration again generates a voltage output\nture formed by the support post 4, beams 14 and 15 and 65 of the upper beam 1 4 which is again a measure of the\nthe attachment rod 9. It should be understood that in\noriginal displacen~ent. The action of the vibratorqr nloorder to depict the nlultiple thickness of each of the\ntion is an output palticularly similar in character to a\nbeams and the plural electrodes thereon, it has been\ntrue impact, and it is actually preferred to plot against\nnecessary to greatly exaggerate the thickness of the beams\ninput voltage the peak output of this vibration rather than\nas viewed in the drawing figures. In actuality the beams 70 the output caused by the initial deflection. Similarly, an\nare very thin in the dimension viewed from the side as in\nA.-C. or pulse voltage will cause the system to vibrate,\nFIG. 1 and are relatively very wide in the dimension\nand the pe;tk of the output voltage can be nleasured and\nviewed from the top as in FIG. 2. In this manner the\nplotted against input voltage. In any of these cases the\nbeams provide extreme sensitivity to motion of the movplot shows a voltage output which corresponds to a given\nable member 8 along a vertical line, and at the same time 75 voltage input under given environmental conditions. This\n\n3,304,773\n\n5\n\nis obviously not an absolute calibration. However, the\nelectrical-input calibration can be rel\'erred to an absolute\ncalibration under the same environmental conditions.\nThus, by dropping beads of known weight from known\nheight and reading the output, the output can be plotted\nagainst actual momentum. In this way it is known that\nfor a given environment a given voltage input gives a\ngiven voltage output, which output is also given by an\nimpact of given momentum. In a specific actual construction of a transducer as shown in FIG. 1, a plot on log\npaper of actual impact against voltage output formed a\nstraight line, and a plot of voltage input against voltage\noutput also formed a straight line. When it is desired to\ncalibrate the apparatus in subsequent use it is only necessary to impart known voltage input and record the voltage\noutput. If the output is less (or more) for a given voltage\ninput than it was in the test environment, then it will be\nknown that the ontput caused by an aclual impact in the\nnew environment will be proportionally less (or more)\nthan the output caused by an impact of the same magnitude under the test environment.\nFor example, assume that under the test environment\nan output reading of .05 volt is given both by a .1 volt\ninput and by an actual momentum i~npactof .02 dynesecond. Then assume that in the actual environment of\nuse, involving for example a substantially different temperature, that an output reading of .05 volt requires a 1.0\nvolt input, indicating that the system is 10 times stiffer,\nIt will therefore be known that an output reading of .05\nvolt in the use environment will indicate an actual impact\nof .2 dyne-second. Thus, by having previously related\ntrue impacts in a test environment to the response for\nknown voltages, a remote calibration can be made by\ntrans~nittinga signal with conveiitional equipment which\ncauses the voltage 42 to be connected and then disconnected from the lower beam 15, as by the switch 45, and\npreferably also varies the voltage over a range to obtain\nseveral check points.\nFIG. 6 shows a modified form of the apparatus. In\nthe embodiment shown in FIG. 6 the various parts which\nare identical to parts in FIG. I are designated by the\nsame reference numbers, and parts which are similar are\nFIG.\ndesignated with primed reference numbers. Th~ls,\n6 is the same as FIG. 1 insofar as base 2, support post\n4, and stop member 35. The beam construction in FIG.\n6 differs from that of FIG. 1 in that only a single beam\n47 is employed in FIG. 6. Bean1 47 is identical in construction to either of the beams 1 4 or 15 of FIG. 1. In\naddition to the single beam difference, the embodiment\nof FIG. 6 differs in the arrangement of the movable Inemher 8\'. Member 8\' has the same attachment head 10\nand the same target 11 as in FIG. 1 and also has a very\nsimilar attachment rod 9\'. However, in FIG. 6 the connection between the attachment rod 9\' and the attachment head PO incorporates an offset portion 48. In this\nmanner the center of mass of the movable member 8\'\nis positioned substantially in line with the center of the\nbeam. As a result the movable member 8\' in FIG. 6\nmoves along a straight vertical line. I in the single beam\nf\nconstruction of FIG. 6 the ~novablemember 8\' were\nmounted with its center of mass directly above the extreme right end of the beam $4, then as the target PI\nnloved downwardly under an impact it ~voulcltilt clockwise as viewed in FIG. 6 and the bean1 47 would experience a single-curve bend. Pt should be noled at this\npoint that the beams 1 4 and 15 in FIG. I and the beam\n47 in FIG. 6 all experience a double-curve bend because\nof the straight-line motion of the mova.ble rtlembers 8\nand 8\'. Conventioilal piezoelectric beams as shown and\ndescribed in particular in FIG. 4 employ only a continuous single upper electrode in place of the two electrodes 19 and 20 employed in the invention and only\na single continuous lower electrode in place of the electrodes 2%and 22. The reason that the invention employs\ndouble electrodes top and bottom is that single electrodes\n\n6\nwould experience equal and opposite forces at their opcancel and result in a zero\nposite ends, which forces wo~ild\noutput. More specifically, it will be noted in FIGS. 5\nand 6 that the upper left portion and the lower right por5 tion of each beam is in tension and the lower left portion and upper right portion of each beam is in compression. As is well known in the art, placing a piezoelectric\nmember in conlpression provides a signal of one polarity\nwhereas placing a piezoelectric member in tension provides a signal of opposite polarity. It is for this reason\nthat the invention requires separate electrodes on the top\nof each beam and separate electrodes on the bottom of\neach beam.\nAs previously explained, the embodiment of FIG. 6\n15 is extremely sensitive and is therefore capable of detecting and measuring extreluely small forces. At the same\ntime the embodinlent of FIG. 6 is very subject to lateral\ndeflection. A slightly modified version of FIG. 6 is\nshown in FIG. 4 and employs means for resisting lateral\n20 deflection. As shown in FIG. 7 the lateral deflection\ncan be resisted by means of thin wires attached to the\nmovable member in such a way as to prevent lateral\nmovement without appreciably resisting the small degree\nof vertical movement required by the apparatus in actual\no_juse. More specifically, the modification of FIG. 7 employs 4 vertical posts 50 mounted on the base 2. A thin\nwire 51 is stretched around the post 50 so that it makes\ntangent contact with 4 points on the periphery of the\ntarget 1 and is bonded to the target at these tangent\n1\n30 points. Four more posts 53 are attached to the base 2\nintermediate to post 50. A separate length of wire 54\nis connected from each post 53 to a tangent point on the\nperiphery of the attachment head PO and is there bonded\nto the head. It will be seen that lateral motion in any\n25 direction will place one or more of the wires 51, 54 directly in tension and thus prevent such motion. However, small vertical movement of the movable member\n8\' will not necessitate any appreciable change in the\nlength of any of the wires and therefore will not involve\n40 any appreciable resistance to movement. Incidentally,\nthe degree of deflection shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 is greatly\nexaggerated to show the type of motion involved. I n\nactual practice pin 39 and bore 40 would be designed to\nprevent wch extreme motion.\nFIG. 8 shows another arrangement for ruggedizing the\n\'15\napparatus without appreciably redncing its sensitivity.\nThe arrangement in FIG. 8 is shown specifically for the\ntype of embodiment of FIG. 1 but is also obviously applicable to the embodiment of FIG. 6. I n FIG. 8 the\n60 parts which are identical to parts in FIG. 1 are given\nthe same reference numbers, and parts which are similar\nare given primed reference n~imbers. In essence, the embodiment in FIG. 8 is the same as the embodiment in\nFIG. 1 except that FIG. 8 employs two sets of beams 14\n5 5 and 15, the beams being arranged in two vertical planes\nset at an angle to each other. It is important to note\nthat the angle between the two sets of beams is other\nthan 180". If the two sets of beams were arranged 180"\nfrom each other, that is directly opposite each other, the\n60 sensitivity of the apparatus would be greatly impaired.\nThe arrangement shown in FIG. 8 involves two support\nposts 4 each having upper and lower beams 1 4 and 15,\nalthough only the upper beam is visible in the right hand\nunits. The only modified element in FIG. 8 is the V05 ~Iiapedstop member 35\' which is common to both of\nthe support posts 4.\nFIG. 9 is a modified transdncer which provides for\nmeasuring components of force along two axes. More\nspecifically the component of force along the vertical or\n70 Y axis can be measured, and in addition the component\nof force along the horizontal X axis can also be measured.\nThe construction of FIG. 9 has a basic similarity to FIG.\n1 and parts which are identical are given the same reference numbers. In FIG. 9 the support post 4 is the same\n75 as the support post 4 in FIG. 1, and the piezoelectric\n\n3,304,773\n\n7\n\n8\n\nbeams 14 and 15 are also the same. However, the movable member 56 in FIG. 9 incorporates a second piezoelectric bean1 system. More specifically the attachment\nrod 9a is connected to a lower bar 57 to form therewith\na T-shaped member. T w o piezoelectric beams 58 and 59\nhave their lower e~lclsattached to the ends o f bar 57 and\ntheir upper ends attached to the ends o f a bar 60. The\nupper end o f rod 9a is not attached to bar 60 but fits\ninto an oversized bore 61 in the bottom o f bar 60 for\nruggedizing the structure. Pins 38 and 39 are provided\nthrough bar 60 and rod 9a for the same purpose as pins\n38 and 39 in stop member 35. It should be enlphasized\nthat rod 9a and bar40 are completely free to move relative to each other in all directions except as limited to\nprevent overload. The attachment head 10 is connected\nto the center o f the upper bar 60. Beams 58 and 59 are\nconstructed exactly the same as beams 14 and 15.\nAs will be obvious from FIG. 9, beams 14 and 15 are\noriented to be deflected by and measure forces along the\nY axis. Similarly beams 58 and 59 are oriented to be\ndeflected by and measure forces along the X axis. Thus,\nwhen an impact is received on a target 11 (not shown in\nFIG. 9 ) the force will be transmitted through the head\n10 and bar 60 to push down through beams 58 and 59\nand force bar 57 downwardly. This downward movement carries rod 9 and deflects beams 14 and 15 to measure the component o f the force along the Y axis. I f\nthe original impact also had a component o f force along\nthe X axis, that component wonld move bar 60 along the\nX axis to deflect beams 58 and 59 and measure the X\ncomponent o f the force.\nFIG. 11 shows still another embodiment o f the transducer. The embodiment o f FIG. 11 is similar to that\no f FIG. 9 but adds the provision for measurement o f\nforces along a third axis. Thus, FIG. 11 provides for\nthe separate measurement o f forces along the X , Y and\nZ axes. In FIG. 11 the parts which are the same as in\nFIG. 9 are given the same reference numbers and parts\nwhich are similar are given primed reference numbers.\nIn FIG. 11 the movable member 56\' con~prisesa support\nrod 90\' which is connected to the attachment head a0\nthrough the medium o f two sets o f piezoelectric beams.\nMore specifically, the upper end o f rod 9n\' projects\nthrough and is rigidly attached to a bar 62. Beams 58\'\nand 59\' have their upper ends connected to bar 42 adjacent the ends o f bar 62, and their lower ends connected\nadjacent the ends of one leg 63 o f a cross-shaped, force\ntransmitting member 64. T w o additional piezoelectric\nbeams 65 and 66 have their lower ends attached adjacent\nthe ends o f the other leg 67 o f the cross-shaped member\n64. The upper ends o f beams 65 and 66 are attached\nadjacent the ends o f an upper bar 6%which carries the\nattachment head 10. In order to ruggedize the transducer\no f FIG. 11, the lower end of rod 90\' fits into an ovelsized\nbore 70 in member 64, and the upper end o f rod 90\'\nfits into an oversized bore 71 in bar 68. Pins 38 and\n39 are provided for both of the bores 70 and 71 for the\nsame purpose as pins 38 and 39 in stop member 35. It\nshould be emphasized that rod 9n\' is not connected to\nmember 64 or bar 68, except to the extent provided by\npins 38 and 39. The beams 65 and 66 are exactly the\nsame as beams 14 and 15 and beams 58\' and 59\'.\nAs is obvious from FIG. 11, beams 14 and 15 are\noriented to be deflected by and measure forces along the\nY axis; beams 58\' and 59\' are oriented to be deflected\nalong the X axis; and beams 65 and 66 are o~ientedto\nbe deflected along the Z axis. Thus, when an impact is\nreceived on a target 11 (not shown in FIG. LO) the\nforce will be transmitted through the head 10 and bar\n68 to push down through beams 65 and 66 and force the\ncross-shaped member 64 downwardly. This downward\nnloven~ent\npulls down on beams 58\' and 54\' to move bar\n62 and attachment rod 9 downwardly and thus deflects\nbeams 14 and 15 to measure the components o f the force\nalong the Y axis. I f the original impact also has a com-\n\nponent o f force along the X axis, that component will\nbe transmitted through bar 683 and through the wider,\nundeflecting dimensions of beams 65 and 66 to move\nthe c~oss-shaped member 64 along the X axis. This\nnlovement along the X axis will deflect beams 58\' and\n59\' to measure the X axis force. I f the original impact\nalso has a con~ponent o f force along the Z axis that\ncomponent will move bar 68 along the Z axis to deflect\nbeams 65 and 66 and thus measure the Z conlponent o f\nthe force. The member 64 is held against movement\nalong the Z axis by the wider, undeflecting dimensions\no f beams 58\', 59\' and 14, 15. Thus, a three component\nforce will cause a n outpg~~volttgg fromall t h r e e s e t s\nbeams. These three output voltages when resolved provide information as to the magnitude o f the momentum\no f the impacting particle and the direction at which the\nparticle struck the target.\nAnother feature o f the invention is that it provides a\ntransducer construction which is particularly adapted for\nuse with a twin transducer to cancel out unwanted vibrations. For example in connection with FIG. 1, it is simply necessary to provide a second support post 4 carrying an exact duplicate o f the structure carried by post 4\nin FIG. 1, except that on the twin transducer the attachment head 10 and target 11 are on the bottom o f rod 9,\nor are replaced by a small dense dummy volume o f equal\nmass. The twin transducer is arranged so that its rod\n9 is parallel to and as close as possible t o the rod 9\nin FIG. 1. Thus, any extraneous vibrations will be equally detected by both the original and the twin, and the\noutput fiom the twin can be subtracted from the output\no f the original to cancel out all vibrations except those\ncaused by the impacts which strike only the original\ntarget in FIG. 1.\nAlthough preferred embodiments o f the present invention are shown and described herein, it is t o be understood that modifications may be therein made without\ndeparting from the spirit and scope o f the invention as\nset forth in the appended claims.\nRaving thus described the invention, what is claimed\nas new and desired to be secured by Letters Patent is:\n1.
