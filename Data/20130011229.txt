b'bellows to the other. The hydrogen flow\nrate through the actuator is directly proportional to the applied current. The hydrogen-filled bellows are used to actuate\na second set of bellows, which displace\nthe fluid in the pump head, as shown\nschematically in Figure 2. To further reduce the pump power requirements, a\nstroke-volume multiplier is utilized\nwherein a smaller-volume hydrogen\nfilled bellows actuates a larger-volume\nfluid bellows. The stroke volume multiplier also allows the pump frequency to\nbe reduced below audible frequency\nwhile maintaining adequate flow.\n\nThe largest factor affecting the lifetime\nand reliability of the pump is expected to\nbe loss of hydrogen from the electrochemical actuator. The electrochemical\nactuator is hermetically sealed; however,\npermeation of hydrogen is expected to\neventually result in loss of hydrogen. The\nlifetime of the pump is extended by generating hydrogen onboard the pump.\nThe onboard hydrogen generation also\nallows the hydrogen pressure and pump\nperformance to be optimized for varying\noperating temperatures.\nThe prototype pump is expected to operate with a power consumption of 2.4 W\n\nat a flow rate of 0.76 L/min and pressure\nrise of 27.6 kPa. The pump will operate at\ntemperatures between 0 and 100 \xc2\xb0C and\nsurvive temperatures between \xe2\x80\x9360 to 110\n\xc2\xb0C. The prototype occupies a volume of\n\xe2\x89\x88600 cm3.\nThis work was done by Robert Van Boeyen\nand Jonathan Reeh of Lynntech, Inc. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

This will allow simultaneous observations of cosmologic targets. It will\nenable large-scale galactic archeology\nand dark energy surveys to help unlock\nthe secrets of the universe.\nTo perform these cosmologic surveys,\nan array of 2,400 optical fibers needs to\nbe independently positioned within the\n498-mm-diameter focal plane of the PFS\ninstrument to collect light from galaxies\nand stars for spectrographic analyses. To\nallow for independent re-positioning of\nthe fibers, a very small positioner (7.7\nmm in diameter) is required. One hundred percent coverage of the focal\nplane is also required, so these small actuators need to cover a patrol region of\n9.5 mm in diameter. To optimize the\namount of light that can be collected,\nthe fibers need to be placed within 5 micrometers of their intended target (either a star or galaxy).\nThe Cobra Fiber Positioner was designed to meet the size and accuracy requirements stated above. Cobra is a twodegrees-of-freedom mechanism that can\nposition an optical fiber in the focal\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, March 2013\n\nThe Prime Focus Spectrometer (PFS) installed on\nthe Subaru Telescope.\n\nplane of the PFS instrument to a precision of 5 micrometers. It is a theta-phi\nstyle positioner containing two rotary\npiezo tube motors with one offset from\nthe other, which enables the optic fibers\nto be placed anywhere in a small circular\npatrol region. The patrol region of the\nactuator is such that the array of 2,400\npositioners allows for full coverage of\nthe instrument focal plane by overlapping the patrol areas.\nA second-generation Cobra positioner was designed based on lessons\nlearned from the original prototype\n\nbuilt in 2009. Improvements were made\nto the precision of the ceramic motor\nparts, and hard stops were redesigned\nto minimize friction and prevent jamming. These changes resulted in reducing the number of move iterations required to position the optical fiber\nwithin 5 micrometers of its target. At the\ntime of this reporting, there are still\nmany tests to be performed that will validate system level performance, but on\nan individual level, the Cobra positioner\ndemonstrates excellent performance\nand will enable the PFS instrument to\nmake unprecedented measurements of\nthe universe.\nWhat is unique about the upgrades\nmade to the Cobra positioner is the improved performance due to the design\nchanges in the hard stops and the ceramic end caps of the motors. Other\nchanges were made to reduce the unit\ncost of a Cobra positioner without affecting the performance, since thousands of\nthese devices will have to be built for the\nPFS instrument.\nThis work was done by Charles D. Fisher,\nDavid F. Braun, and Joel V. Kaluzny of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor more information, contact iaoffice@\njpl.nasa.gov. NPO-48751\n\n17\n\n'
