The purpose of this conversion was to prepare LAMPS for porting to computer environments other than that encountered at NCAR. The emphasis was shifted from programming tasks to model simulation and evaluation tests.", "title": "LAMPS software", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840026813, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Perkey, D.
