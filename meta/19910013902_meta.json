It was demonstrated that the results from the FPS-16 radar/jimsphere balloon system in measuring winds can indeed indicate the presence or conditions ripe for turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. It was further demonstrated that atmospheric data obtained during the shuttle launches by the rawinsonde in conjunction with the jimsphere provides the necessary meteorological data to compute aerodynamic parameters to identify turbulence, such as Reynolds number drag coefficient, turbulent stresses, total energy, stability parameter, vertical gradient of kinetic energy, Richardson number, and the turbulence probability index. Enhanced temperature lapse rates and inversion rates, strong vector wind shears, and large changes in wind direction identify the occurrence of turbulence at the troposphere. When any two of the above conditions occur simultaneously, a significant probability of turbulence can occur.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910013902, "id": "a4867666713c4073b3477d01a108a2f9", "publicationDate": "1991-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910013902.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910013902/downloads/19910013902.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910013902/downloads/19910013902.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910013902/downloads/19910013902.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
