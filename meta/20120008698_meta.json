Extending from 95 to 141 degrees East longitude and from 6 degrees North to 11 degrees South latitude. Further the market of the Space Solar Power/SPS must be worldwide, including Indonesia. As we know, it can provide electricity anywhere in the world from the Earth's orbit, mostly Indonesia an equator country. We have to perform case studies of various countries to understand their benefits and disadvantages provided by the SSP, because each country has much different condition on energy from other countries. We are at the moment starting the international collaboration between Indonesia and Japan to carry out the case study for Indonesia. We understand that in Indonesia itself each province has much different micro-climate between one province compared to the other. In Japan, METI (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) has already organized a committee to investigate the feasibility of Space Solar Power and to make a plan to launch a space demonstration of the SPS. While, Indonesia is quickly developing economy and increasing their energy demand. We are investigating the detailed energy conditions of Indonesia, the benefits and disadvantages of the Space Solar Power for Indonesia. Especially, we will perform the investigation on the receiving system for the Japanese pilot Space Power Satellite.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120008698, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "53rd International Astronautical Congress/2002 World Space Congress", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "4fdfd48605c849f49c0f6e5cd717a27a", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120008698, "endDate": "2002-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "34th COSPAR Scientific Assembly, The Second World Space Congress", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "5a68323ea0f44bbd8aa960e320f3bb8d", "startDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120008698, "id": "8514e7132b244346b089a9bf6fe171de", "publicationDate": "2002-10-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120008698.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120008698/downloads/20120008698.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120008698/downloads/20120008698.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120008698/downloads/20120008698.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
