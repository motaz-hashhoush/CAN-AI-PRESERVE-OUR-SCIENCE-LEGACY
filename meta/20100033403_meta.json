Specifically, a telerobotic workstation is being designed for an Extravehicular Activity (EVA) anthropomorphic space station telerobot called Robonaut. Previous researchers have designed telerobotic workstations based upon performance of discrete subsets of tasks (for example, peg-in-hole, tracking, etc.) without regard for transitions that operators go through between tasks performed sequentially in the context of larger integrated tasks. The experiments presented here took an integrated approach to describing teleoperator performance and assessed how subjects operating a full-immersion telerobot perform during fine position and gross position tasks. In addition, a Robonaut simulation was also developed as part of this research effort, and experimentally tested against Robonaut itself to determine its utility. Results show that subject performance of teleoperated tasks using both Robonaut and the simulation are virtually identical, with no significant difference between the two. These results indicate that the simulation can be utilized as both a Robonaut training tool, and as a powerful design platform for telepresence displays and aids.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100033403, "endDate": "2001-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c0c2ea3638c34d83b08795105adbfbd3", "id": "c25939009ff04b61b497aad84804c189"}], "name": "Conference on International Space Station Utilization", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "c0c2ea3638c34d83b08795105adbfbd3", "startDate": "2001-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100033403, "id": "c5fd7e2df21b4a4b8cc36f57b158db67", "publicationDate": "2001-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100033403.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100033403/downloads/20100033403.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100033403/downloads/20100033403.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100033403/downloads/20100033403.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
