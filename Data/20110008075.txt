Titan's surface, and middle atmosphere show noticeable seasonal\nchange, whereas that in most of the troposphere is mated. This can be understood in terms of the relatively small\nradiative relaxation time in the middle atmosphere and much larger time scale in the troposphere. The surface\nexhibits seasonal change because the heat capacity in an annual skin depth is much smaller than that in the lowest\nscale height of the troposphere. Surface temperatures rise I K at raid and high latitudes in the winter northern\nhemisphere and cool in the southern hemisphere. Changes in in the middle atmosphere are more complicated.\nTemperatures in the middle stratosphere (-1 mbar) increase by a few kelvin at mid northern latitudes, but those\nat high latitudes first increase as that region troves out of winter shadow, and then decrease. This probably results\nfrom the combined effect of increased solar heating as the suit moves higher in the sky and the decreased adiabatic\nwarming as the sinking motions associated with the cross-equatorial meridional cell weaken. Consistent with this\ninterpretation, the warm temperatures observed higher up at the winter polar stratopause coot significantly.\n\n"
