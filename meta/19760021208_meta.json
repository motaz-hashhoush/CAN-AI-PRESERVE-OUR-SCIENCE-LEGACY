Measurements of the Martian atmosphere provided data on its molecular composition, temperature and pressure. The detection of nitrogen in the Martian atmosphere indicates the existence of life. Panoramic photographs of the Martian surface were also obtained and are shown. Preliminary chemical and biological investigations on samples of Martian soil indicated the presence of the elements iron, calcium, silicon, titanium and aluminum as major constituents. Observed biochemical reactions were judged conducive of biological activity.", "title": "Viking 1:  early results", "stiType": "SPECIAL_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T11:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Special Publication (SP)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19760021208, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760021208, "id": "9e3d4a42627e4dfab22c5e910792fadc", "publicationDate": "1976-08-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760021208.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760021208/downloads/19760021208.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760021208/downloads/19760021208.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760021208/downloads/19760021208.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
