Introduction\n\nThe electrostatically focused amplifier (ESFA) project\nis a portion of JPL's advanced development program for\nS-band (2295 MHz) spaceborne transmitter tubes. The\nwork is being performed by the Klystron Department of\nEIMAC, Division of Varian Associates, under JPL Contract 951105 (SPS 37-37, Vol. IV, pp. 258-259; SPS 37-48,\nVol. 111, pp. 278-280).\n2. Mechanical and Electrical Design\n\nA fifth developmental tube has been fabricated and\ntested. This was the first of the experimental ESFAs to\nuse a radiation-cooled collector system. The electrical\ndesign of tube 5 was similar in most respects to its watercooled predecessor, tube 4,which had reached nearly all\nof the electrical design goals. The mechanical design,\nhowever, was changed significantly to accept the radiating cooling system and to conform to the intended final\npackaging design.\na Radiating cooling system.

The\nESFA project supported the development of a collectorcooling system that efficiently radiates this heat directly\nthrough the vacuum envelope of the tube into its outside\nenvironment, whether atmospheric or vacuum, thus relieving the spacecraft cooling system of this significant\nthermal load.\nThe basic design is a collector element that is a thin\ntungsten egg-shell shape. One end is opened to admit-the\nelectron beam that, in turn, heats the tungsten shell to\nextremely high temperatures. The shell radiates this heat\nthrough a sapphire, infrared transparent window with the\naid of a tantalum reflector. Prototypes of this collector\nsystem were tested earlier in the program and demonstrated radiating efficiencies of 80%.\nTube 5 was the first operating ESFA to employ the\nradiating collector and successfully demonstrated that\nthis technique is usable. Figure 1 shows tube 5 under\nundriven conditions where its collector is operating at\n1600OC. At this temperature, the collector is directly radiating 214 W of heat. Vendor measurements show that\nsimultaneously 32 W is conducted back to the tube body.\nAlso heating the body is the beam interception current,\namounting to 18 W, and the heater power which is 4.3 W.\n169\n\nc. Helical resonators. The loaded Q of resonators 2, 3,\nand 4 was lowered from 270 to 150 to produce a smoother\nbandpass characteristic of the tube. This was accomplished by plating a thin coating of iron on a portion of\nf\neach o the helical circuits. This successfully removed the\nhigh-Q ripples in the output bandpass of tube 5.\nd. Electron gun. Dispenser cathodes have been used in\nf\nall prior experimental models o the ESFA because of\ntheir ability to be reactivated after a tube has temporarily\nlost its vacuum. These cathodes require 12 W of heater\npower and do not possess the life capability for the specified 20,000 h. A long-life oxide cathode was designed for\nthe final units, and the first one was installed in tube 5.\nIt provided full beam power and required only 4.3 W of\nheater power.\nFig. 1. Tube 5 operating in an RF undriven condition\n\nThis brings the total body heat to 54.3 W. Thus, the total\ntube, in this condition of operation, radiates its own generated heat with an efficiency of 75%.\nUnder RF driven conditions (100-W RF output), the\nbeam is spread by RF fields and heats the collector more\nuniformly. The RF power output of the tube subtracts\nenergy from the beam, and the collector temperature\nlowers to 1300OC. The intercepted body currents increase\nwith the beam spreading, and the radiation efficiency of\nthe collector decreases because of the lower collector temperature. Accurate thermal measurements have not yet\nbeen made in this condition of operation.\n\nb. Electrostatic lenses. It is intended that all of the\nfocusing lenses be connected to the cathode potential. In\nprior experimental tubes, each lens was brought out separately to evaluate its influence on confining the beam.\nThe sizes of the lenses were refined in tube 5 so that it\nwas possible to connect the first 5 (total of 8) directly to\nthe cathode and yet obtain proper focusing fields. No RF\nfeedback through the lens system was observed.\n\n170\n\n3. General Tube Performance\n\nThe electron gun in tube 5 was misaligned during its\nassembly. The beam was thereby directed out of the\nfocusing axis, which resulted in heavy interception on the\nhelical circuits of resonators 5, 6, and 7. The resulting\nheat that was created evaporated the helix brazing material which redeposited on the surrounding insulator rods.\nAfter locating the beam by thermal profile measurements,\nit was centered in the tube by external magnets. Subsequent RF tests made at the 100-W output level indicated\nthe gain to be 40 dB and the bandwidth at 30 MHz. The\ndamaged resonators, however, lowered the electronic efficiency to 34%,\nwhereas prior tubes had produced 45%\nat\nthe same operating point.\n4. Future Tasks\n\nTube 5 will be rebuilt, using new helical resonators and\na new electron gun. Its output cavity and radiating collector will be used again, since no damage occurred in these\nelements. Heliarc seals will be used in place of brazed\njoints in several areas to ensure better alignment of the\ncomponent parts. Tube 5 is scheduled to finish its refurbishing cycle late in November 1968.\n\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\n"
