High\nsensitivity is obtained by integrating high performance detectors with gain, i.e., APDs with very low noise Readout\nIntegrated Circuits (ROICs). Unique aspects of these designs include: independent acquisition (non-gated) of pulse\nreturns, multiple pulse returns with both time and intensity reported to enable full 3D reconstruction of the image.\nRecent breakthrough in device design has resulted in HgCdTe APDs operating at 300K with essentially no excess noise\nto gains in excess of 100, low NEP <1nW and GHz bandwidths and have demonstrated linear mode photon counting.\nSCAs utilizing these high performance APDs have been integrated and demonstrated excellent spatial and range\nresolution enabling detailed 3D imagery both at short range and long ranges. In the following we will review progress in\nreal-time 3D LADAR imaging receiver products in three areas: (1) scanning 256 \xc3\x97 4 configuration for the Multi-Mode\nSensor Seeker (MMSS) program and (2) staring 256 \xc3\x97 256 configuration for the Autonomous Landing and Hazard\nAvoidance Technology (ALHAT) lunar landing mission and (3) Photon-Counting SCAs which have demonstrated a\ndramatic reduction in dark count rate due to improved design, operation and processing.\nKeywords: APD, HgCdTe, LADAR\n\n1. INTRODUCTION AND OUTLINE\nThis paper provides an overview of advanced LADAR receiver technology at Raytheon Vision Systems (RVS) ranging\nfrom high sensitivity single element APDs and associated low noise amplifiers to high speed scanning arrays 256 \xc3\x97 4\nand very large format 256 \xc3\x97 256 asynchronous (non-gated) flash receivers and small format linear mode photon counting\nmodules. These have in common the use of MBE grown n on p HgCdTe engineered for excess noise factors near unity,\noperation at ambient temperatures and bandwidth up to 1 GHz. In this paper we focus on the status of real-time 3D\nimaging LADAR receiver products in scanning and staring and photon counting configurations. The scanning 256 \xc3\x97 4\nreceiver is a 2nd generation sensor developed for the Multi-Mission Sensor Seeker (MMSS) program. The staring 256 \xc3\x97\n256 receiver, the largest HgCdTe APD LADAR receiver operating at ambient, uses a sophisticated multiple laser pulse\nreturn ROIC. Its development has been supported in part by NASA under the Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance\nTechnology ALHAT program.

As shown in the top and bottom (moving) images, the receiver,\ncaptures wide FOV 3D images in real-time. Operation of the sensor is asynchronous, i.e., the close and far object\nimages are obtained with one laser pulse. Incremental time gating is not required.\n\nFigure 4 Navy Images from Raytheon\xe2\x80\x99s 1st Generation Flash LADAR (a) 3D Point Cloud Color Maps into Range; (b)\nVisible Image; (c) Movie Illustrating Real-time 3D Image Capture of Boats.\n\n4.\n\nDETECTOR DESIGN\n\nFor tactical ambient temperature tactical mission applications HgCdTe can be engineered to provide high gain and low\nexcess noise at 300K or higher. Under these circumstances we note the following with reference to Figure 5.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Most APDs obey the McIntyre excess noise equation: Fex= keff \xc3\x97 Me + (2-1/Me) \xc3\x97 (1-keff) (Fig. 5)\no\n\nkeff = Ionization ratio of holes/Ionization rate of electrons, Me = Gain\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Most III-V APDS have k~ 0.15 \xe2\x80\x93 0.2 resulting in Fex ~ 10 at gain of 40 The theoretical best is Fex =2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HgCdTe electron injection show gain and excess noise properties indicative of deterministic single carrier gain\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Thus for HgCdTe Fex is ~1 (Ideal Amplifier) is Achieved:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Also RVS has uniquely engineered MBE HgCdTe APDs to have Fex~ 1 at 300K\nFrom Figure 4 HgCdTe at Me ~100 enables 10-20 x lower noise than III-V APDs and 4x lower noise than Si. Figure 5\nshows the low excess noise achieved Fex ~ 1 for HgCdTe, in comparison with InAlAs and Silicon APDs. At Me ~100\nthe HgCdTe shows 4x lower noise floor than Si and 20x lower noise than InAlAs APDs.\n\n5\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nProbability of Photo\nElectron Achieving Gain\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\n10 0\n\nMean Gain =100\n\n10 -1\n10-2\n\nInAlAs\nHCT APDs\nTight Gain\nDistribution\n\nLow Gain Events not\nseen by InAlAs APD\n\n10-3\n10 -4\n10\n\nHgCdTe\n\n-5\n\n10 -6\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nGain\nFigure 5.

InAlAs\nAPDs (keff ~ 0.18) have very wide gain dispersion.\n\n4.1 Photon Counting\nFor photon counting applications excess noise, Fex, reflects the variation in gain from laser shot to shot. This can be seen\nin Figure 6, which plots probability of achieving a gain vs. gain. The distribution of gains for HgCdTe is close to the\naverage value here 100. For InAlAs with k~ 0.18 probability of achieving the distribution of gains is very large with the\nhighest probability at low gains and low but not zero probability at gains well above 100. These supergain events occur\noccasionally but skew the average so that the mean is still 100. However if threshold is set at \xc2\xbd the average value of\ngain i.e. 50, we will miss over 90% of the events. So probability of detection is low. If we set a very low threshold\nnoise will trigger the detection so we will get many false alarms.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fex = <Me2>/<Me>2 Variance/Average\n\xe2\x80\xa2 For HgCdTe APDs Fex =1 Implies Zero or Minimal Gain Variation from Shot to Shot (Low gain dispersion)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Achieves Higher Probability of Detection than III-V or Silicon APDs\n\n6\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\n5. READOUT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\nFigure 7 illustrates typical parameters for our asynchronous ROICs. These large format chips use advanced submicron\nCMOS.

SCANNING LADAR - MMSS PROGRAM\n6.1 SCAs and IDAs\nFigure 8a shows the 256 \xc3\x97 4 Scanning LADAR SCA developed for the MMSS program, installed in a TEC stabilized\npackage before sealing. The SCA uses APD array and circuit technology nearly identical to that used for the large flash\narray. The hermetic package utilized is compact and common to both designs. The single stage TEC enables operation in\nstandard Mil-Spec environments. The interface board provides bypass capacitors, multiplexers and LVDS receivers.\nFigure 8b shows the IDA after vacuum package and sealing.\n\nFigure 8. 2nd Gen Line Scan LADAR 256 \xc3\x97 4 SCAs Integrated into Thermal Electrically Cooled Packag\n\n6.2 Test Results\nUnits are extensively tested both at SCA and at IDA assembly stages.\nFull array measurements are made of\nresponsivity, Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) and Minimum Detectable Signal (MDS) all at ambient temperature. The\nlatter MDS measurement is an overall determination of minimum laser power needed for high confidence detection by\nthe full array. The measurement outcome is shown in Figure 9. MDS is measured as part of performance qualification\nat SCA test (and after integration into the TEC package) by uniformly illuminating the receiver chip with a pulsed laser\nat 1.55 \xc2\xb5m. Prior to illumination pixels are adjusted to a specified false alarm rate i.e. one false alarm per 100 frames or\n1%. The laser then uniformly illuminates that array and the state of each pixel is measured after each pulse. If the pixel\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrips\xe2\x80\x9d in response to the laser 95 times out of 100 pulses, the pixel is identified as good. At moderate levels of\nillumination nearly all the pixels will trip in response to the laser pulse. For this typical array we have 99.6%\ndetection operability. As the laser power is reduced some of the pixels do not respond 95 times out of 100. The power\nwhere at least 95% of the pixels respond 95 times out of 100 shots is defined as the MDS with a specified FAR in this\ncase 1%.\nThe curve in Figure 9 plots the number of pixels which detect vs. flux. The MDS is then the value of the horizontal axis\nwhen the vertical axis is 95% of the array. MDS curves plotted as a function of APD gain, illustrate the dramatic 10x\n\n8\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\nimprovements as gain is increased up 20 in this case. NOTE: In all cases, the chip biases are adjusted so that no more\nthan 1% false alarms are recorded. IDAs qualified by this final ambient temperature test were delivered to the customer\n1Q of 2012.\n\nFigure 9.

STARING ARRAYS - ALHAT PROJECT\nNASA \xe2\x80\x98s Autonomous Precision Landing and Hazard Detection Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project is actively\npursuing development of 3-D Imaging Flash LADAR technology for precision safe landing on the Moon and other\nplanetary bodies. Future robotic and human exploration vehicles to the Moon will require advanced technology\ndevelopment to support safe and precision landing on the lunar surface. Lunar exploration may require landing in areas\nof total darkness where hazardous terrain features such as rocks or craters could be obscured. Hazard detection must be\nquick, achievable under any lighting condition, and at a far enough range to divert and guide the vehicle to a safe landing\nzone. Although precision-landing accuracies of tens of meters will be required for these missions, the hazard detection\nsensor will need to resolve terrain features at a few centimeters in-depth from standoff ranges hundreds of meters away.\nAs illustrated in Figure 10, the ALHAT project will develop descent and landing Guidance, Navigation and Control\n(GNC) hardware and software technologies necessary to advance the state-of-the-art in order to support lunar crew,\ncargo, or robotic missions.\nThe primary objective of ALHAT is to develop and mature an autonomous lunar landing GN&C and sensing system\nmeeting the following general requirements:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Improve Landing Accuracy from 1 km to 30 meters\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Incorporate Hazard Detection and Avoidance capability (Detecting rocks > 30 cm in height, and slopes > 5 deg.\nover 10 m)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Enable landing anywhere and under any lighting conditions\n\n9\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\nAlthough ALHAT focuses on lunar landing, its technology can be applied to landing in other planetary bodies in the\nsolar system (e.g. Mars), Figure 10.\nFlash LADAR can perform three functions critical for\nprecision safe landing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hazard Detection and Avoidance (1 km to 100 m)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Terrain Relative Navigation (15 km to 2 km)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Altimetry (20 km to 100 m)\nFigure 11 provides the ALHAT Flash LADAR operational\nscenario and a description of these functions.\n\nFigure 10.

Once fabricated, arrays are tested at wafer level for key characteristics listed below.\nStatistical measurements provide an early assessment of uniformity expected for the final product. Figure 12 illustrates\nthe protocol selected for statistical measurements on the wafer. Forty five diodes were tested every fifth diode along a\nrow that spans 256 APDs. Gain, responsivity, dark current and NEP were extracted. Figure 13 shows a skyline plot of\nall 45 diodes at various bias voltages selected to achieve gains of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100. All APDs tested had full\noperability and achieved a gain of 100. Only small spatial variations in gain are observed along the row of 45 diodes as\nbias is adjusted to achieve each nominal gain from 5 to 100. Non-uniformity (sigma/mean) of <8% was seen for all\ngains. With low defect wafers now being grown this excellent performance is routinely seen on multiple wafers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bias dependence data taken on 45 diodes\no\n\nDetector bias voltage stepped\n\no\n\nSignal and noise measurements\n\no\n\nTest used to derive excess noise factor\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Data extracted and plotted\no\n\nGain\n\no\n\nResponsivity\n\no\n\nDark Current\n\no\n\nNEP @ 42 MHz bandwidth\nFigure 12.

It has been optimized for performance required by NASA for\nthe lunar landing. As discussed in Section 3.0, this design uses a 0.18 \xc2\xb5m CMOS process to provide sophisticated\nfunctionality per pixel while achieving the desired very low noise 0.5pA/rt-Hz to complement the APD performance.\nLaser returns are detected asynchronously (not gated) and both intensity and time of arrival are acquired for up to three\n\n11\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\nreturns per frame time. Timing precision is key to accurate relative range data, i.e., range precision. To achieve required\n5 cm range precision the ROIC timing accuracy has been improved to 300ps. Multiple returns from a single outgoing\npulse are expected when a pixel sees the edge of a boulder and the adjacent ground.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 256 \xc3\x97 256 format\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Low noise amplification , 0.5 pA/rt-Hz\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 0.18 \xc2\xb5m CMOS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Range and intensity acquired for up to three\nreturns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 60 \xc2\xb5m pixels\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Asynchronous\n(not gated)\n\nacquisition\n\nof\n\nlaser\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Range precision 5 cm (0.3 ns)\n\nreturns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 60 Hz operation\n\n7.3 Packaged SCAs\nOnce functioning ROIC die and detector die have been identified, they are \xe2\x80\x9cIndium bump hybridized\xe2\x80\x9d using the process\npresently used for IR sensors. Figure 14a shows the hybridized Sensor Chip Assembly (SCA) attached and bonded into\na Leadless Chip Carrier and installed in an Integrated Dewar Assembly or IDA. Passive components are installed on the\nsame package to optimized performance.\n\nFigure 14. ALHAT SCA Packaged in TEC Stabilized IDA & MDS Qualification Test Prior to Shipment to NASA\n\n7.4 SCA & IDA Test Results\nSCAs are evaluated for full functionality and quantitative measurements are performed across the entire array of key\nparameters which include signal response, responsivity, noise and NEP. A key sensor/system parameter, Minimum\nDetectable Signal (MDS) is also determined. SCAs that meet requirements are packaged in a TEC stabilized package,\nIntegrated Dewar Assembly or IDA (Figure 14a) for operation at ambient temperature. Final tests are performed prior to\n\n12\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\ndelivery. The key test is determining MDS (Figure 14b). It should be emphasized that all data was taken at ambient\ntemperature as was the case for the MMSS scanning arrays.\nAs discussed in the prior section, Minimum Detectable Signal is a key system-sensor parameter and corresponds to array\nlevel signal where high probability of target detection can be achieved. The MDS definition is the signal level at which\n95% of the array triggers on the return laser pulse 95 times or more out of 100 laser shots. Figure 14b plots the\ncumulative number of pixels which detect the laser pulse 95/100 times as the laser pulse energy is lowered. Operability\nat high flux is excellent >98% at a gain of 20. MDS is determined as the horizontal axis value when the curve meets the\n95% point we see that the MDS for the array decreases from unity gain value of 45 nW to a 15 nW at a gain of 6 to\n~5nW at a gain of 15 \xe2\x80\x93 20, clearly meeting the design goal of <10nW. Note also that the MDS continues to improve as\nthe gain is increased in contrast with III-V APDs where increases in gain at some point will increase the noise due to\nexcess noise factors. The good performance is due to the near unity excess noise factor for HgCdTe. The solid dark line\nindicated improvements in performance anticipated for future designs with higher gains. The ALHAT sensor was\nqualified and shipped to NASA in the 1rst quarter of 2012.\n\n8.\n\nPHOTON COUNTING SENSORS\n\n8.1 SCA Design and 2007 Measurements\nFigure 15 illustrates a 4 \xc3\x97 4 Photon Counting Sensor, the SB415B. This design and its predecessor, the SB332, use a\ncombination of high gain amplifier and HgCdTe APDs whose design is nearly identical to that used for the previously\ndescribed scanning and staring arrays operating at ambient temperature. A small APD array is hybridized to the center\nof the ROIC. Outputs from the APDs operated at moderate gains 50-200 are amplified with low noise GHz amplifiers in\neach pixel. The output from each channel is buffered and driven off chip at GHz BW by drivers.\n\nFigure 15. Photon Counting SCA Showing the Small APD Array Hybridized to the GHz BW ROIC\n\nFigure 15 illustrates photon counting achieved in 2007 using the SB332 ROIC design. Measurements were made at an\naverage illumination strength of one photon on the detector per pulse. Figure 1a shows discrimination between zero, one\nand two photons; 1b the ability to detect two closely spaced photons with no afterpulsing and figure 1c shows excellent\nagreement between the measured and calculated poisson distribution of incoming photons. The detector preserves the\nphoton distribution.\n\n13\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\nFigure 16. 2007 Demonstration of Photon Counting: (a) Multiple acquisitions showing detection of 0, 1 and 2 photons with\naverage illumination of <1> photon (b) Acquisition of closely double pulse closely spaced photons (<6ns) with no\nafterpulsing observed; (c) Comparison of measured photon distribution for 100 pulsed laser exposures vs predicted from\nPoisson distribution showing good agreement\n\n8.2 Breakthroughs in Performance - ROSES Program\nUnder NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ROSES program (contract with University of Hawaii) a second generation ROIC, SB415 was integrated\nwith APD arrays fabricated using a process optimized for low surface and bulk dark current. Because of the GHz\namplifiers it was suspected that one contribution to residual dark counts was glow (light emitted due to hot carriers) from\nthe GHz bandwidth amplifiers. High sensitivity imaging at the silicon bandedge of the ROIC was performed by the U of\nH team using their ultra low light leakage (<1photon/hour) cryo-test station, Figure 18. The results (Figure 17) clearly\nshows the correlation between location of the GHz buffers and emitted light from the photo-micrograph on the left. The\ngraph on the right shows the reduced light output when bias was adjusted to minimize glow while achieving required\nperformance. Detection of an individual photon is shown in Figure 19a. Signal to noise >10 with low dark counts is\nachieved. The curve shows very low sub pico-amp surface dark current (seen as shallow slope of the curve). This low\nsurface dark current enables look times as long as 10ms without resetting. Performance parameters of the SCA are\nsummarized in Figure 19b. The dark counts and SNR taken together enable a probability of detection >95% with low\nFAR <1%. Units were shipped to U of H 4th quarter of 2010. Photon counting was verified by researchers at U or H\nusing the cryo-system shown in Figure 18. Typical results are shown in Figure 20.

Here we show operational 256 \xc3\x97 256\narrays linear mode SCAs developed for NASA Langley under the ALHAT program. As previously discussed these APD\narrays have demonstrated excellent uniformity at a single bias voltage with gains up to 100 at ambient and SCAs at\nambient temperature have shown excellent uniformity with >99% operability and Minimum Detectable Signal (MDS)\n<10nW. The architecture of the 4 \xc3\x97 4 linear mode photon counting SCAs which as discussed has been realized with\nvery low dark count rates can readily be scaled to these larger formats.\n\nFigure 21. Future Directions in Linear Mode Photon Counting. Advances in low dark current linear mode photon counting\ncan readily be applied to large format configurations such as the 256 \xc3\x97 256 ALHAT LADAR receiver developed for NASA\nwhich at ambient temperature have demonstrated excellent uniformity with a single APD bias, high gains to 100 and\nexcellent sensitivity with MDS <10 nW.\n\n10. SUMMARY\nHigh performance Scanning, Staring and Photon Counting LADAR receivers have been developed using high\nperformance common elements specifically: HgCdTe APDs engineered for an excess noise of 1 (Fex ~1) both at ambient\ntemperatures integrated with deep submicron ROIC integrated circuits whose design enables asynchronous (non gated)\ncapture of multiple up to three laser returns. Large format scanning 256 \xc3\x97 4 and 256 \xc3\x97 256 staring receivers built with\nthese common elements have been integrated into common compact TEC packaging, tested and delivered to Navy and\nNASA customers respectively. Qualification testing has shown operability >99% with low Minimum Detectable Signal\n(MDS) <10nW at 300K. The same APD/circuit technology has shown photon counting with SNR >10 to above 180K\nwith dark count rates still limited by Silicon Circuit \xe2\x80\x9cglow\xe2\x80\x9d at <104 cps below 160K. In the future, the architecture of\nthe 4 \xc3\x97 4 linear mode photon counting SCAs realized with very low dark count rates can readily be scaled to larger\nformats. The use of common designs in HgCdTe APD arrays with high gain and no excess noise at ambient, and low\ntemperature coupled with mature high yield ROICs and compact TEC packaging enables an affordable new capability\nfor high acuity 3D real-time imaging, long range threat detection, and navigation.\n\n17\n\nApril 2012: SPIE Defense Security and Sensors\nSession # 8353-77/Chief Author: Michael Jack\n\nApproved for public release; Distribution is unlimited.\n\n11.
