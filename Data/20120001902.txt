b'Modified Fittings Enhance Industrial Safety\nNASA Technology\n\nK\n\nennedy Space Center is not only home to one\nof the largest buildings in the world\xe2\x80\x94the massive Vehicle Assembly Building\xe2\x80\x94it also hosts\na number of one-of-a-kind facilities. The more than\n30-mile-long campus has witnessed every launch from\nthe Space Shuttle Launch Pad, as well as many homecomings at the Shuttle Landing Facility. Just as important,\nthe Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) has seen\neach element of the International Space Station (ISS) that\npasses through Kennedy before it goes into orbit.\nThe SSPF is where ISS components are checked,\ntested, and adjusted before being packed into the\nSpace Shuttle for transport. In an environment like the\nSSPF\xe2\x80\x94spanning 457,000 square feet of processing areas,\noperational control rooms, laboratories, logistics areas,\nand office space\xe2\x80\x94large workstands and equipment used\nto support the processing of ISS components need to be\nmoved around the facility. One of the devices employed\nfor this task is an air pallet. An air pallet moves on cushions of air instead of wheels. Compressed air inflates\nthe cushions underneath the pallet and is then expelled\nthrough exhaust holes. This forms a thin film of air\nbetween the cushions and the floor, lifting the platform\noff the floor and making it easy to move the heavy workstands, equipment, and ISS components.\nConcerned with the safety of the connections on the\npressurized air hoses used for the air pallets, engineers\nat Kennedy modified an existing commercial cam and\ngroove fitting to control the air supply hose in the event\nof an accidental release of a pressurized hose. This modification prevented the hose from detaching and, propelled\nby compressed air, striking workers or equipment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time, these were not available on commercial\ncoupling halves, so NASA made a modification and then\nput them into use. If a worker were to accidentally try to\nremove a pressurized hose from the pallet, it no longer\nrapidly separated, and it safely relieved the pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d says\n\n80\t\n\nPublic Safety\t\n\nPaul Schwindt, an engineer at Kennedy who together with\nAlan Littlefield, also an engineer at Kennedy, designed\nthe modification.\n\nPartnership\nYears after NASA modified the coupling halves, an\nengineer at an Enid, Oklahoma-based business, PT\nCoupling Company, was looking for a solution for one\nof the company\xe2\x80\x99s customers working in Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s North\nSlope. The customer had some incidents on a pipeline\nwhere fittings under pressure were disconnected and\nresulted in injuries to the workers.\n\nTo address the problem, the company developed some\nprototypes, but nothing worked well, says Kyle Eckhardt,\nthe engineer at PT Coupling. \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to come up\nwith a solution when I came across the NASA fitting\ndescription while doing some research online. It was\nsimple, practical, and it really worked,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nEckhardt contacted Pasquale Ferrari, a technology\ntransfer agent at Kennedy, and then signed an agreement\nto transfer the hardware modification. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something\nthat NASA made that nobody else was making,\xe2\x80\x9d says\nFerrari. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to move technology,\nand that is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, an overhead crane lowers the International Space Station\xe2\x80\x99s\nTranquility module. It is here where NASA engineers made a particular modification to some fittings that is now incorporated into\ncommercial fittings for the petroleum and chemical industries.\n\nSpinoff 2011\n\nPT Coupling made additional changes to the NASAmodified fittings. These included removing a catch slot\non the front of the adapter, developing different hardware sizes (2- and 3-inch sizes), and using new materials.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA\xe2\x80\x99s fitting was aerospace grade and very expensive.\nWe came up with materials that had the same properties\nbut were more common,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eckhardt. By 2011, PT\nCoupling started offering a promising new product for\nthe petroleum and chemical industries called PT Pressure\nSafe.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of industrial fittings for liquid and dry material transfer applications, PT\nCoupling makes cam and groove couplings. Such fittings\nare made up of two parts: a male (adapter/plug) and female\n(coupler/socket) that work together. The male adapter and\nfemale coupler are easily connected to make contact with\nthe gasket, and then two arms on the coupler are depressed\nsimultaneously to produce a seal. To release the seal, the\narms are lifted. A main benefit of the fittings is quick connection and disconnection without using hand tools or\nthreaded connections.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs quick release fittings, they are designed for when\nhoses are constantly changed. Threaded fittings take more\ntime to tighten and loosen. With cam and groove, you\nsimply actuate the two arms to connect or disconnect the\nfitting,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eckhardt.\nWhile these cam and groove fittings are quick and\neasy to connect and disconnect, they can be dangerous if\ndisconnected under pressure. The new PT Pressure Safe\nfittings, based on the NASA-modified coupling halves,\nsolve this problem by capturing the energy and releasing it\nin a controlled and safe manner.\nAvailable for most cam and groove styles, PT Pressure\nSafe automatically prevents rapid separation of the fittings\nin a fluid or dry material delivery system. Based on the\nNASA hardware modifications, PT Pressure Safe will not\nallow a user to close the arms on the coupler until the two\nSpinoff 2011 \t\n\nPublic\nSafety\n\nBenefits\n\nThe PT Pressure Safe cam and groove system from PT Coupling Company utilizes technology transferred from NASA. The\nsystem prevents personal injury and property damage by ensuring the coupling halves on a delivery system do not disconnect\nwhile under pressure.\n\npieces are locked and rotated 45 degrees. If released under\npressure, the modification ensures the coupling halves will\nnot disconnect. Once the pressure in the delivery system\nis sufficiently low, the adaptor can be rotated and be safely\ndisengaged. According to Eckhardt, the simplicity of the\ndesign is what makes the fittings so unique and versatile.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event that the hose connections are opened\nunder pressure, the PT Pressure Safe will prevent the\nfittings from separating completely. The feature allows\nthe operator to safely open the fittings under pressure by\npreventing rapid separation of the coupler and adapter,\nprotecting the operator and surrounding equipment from\npersonal injury and damage,\xe2\x80\x9d says Eckhardt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone\n\nconcerned with safety with cam and groove fittings would\nwant to use PT Pressure Safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPotential customers for the PT Pressure Safe are the\npetroleum and chemical industries, and any industry that\ntransports liquid under pressure. The company currently\noffers 2- and 3-inch sizes, but can develop and manufacture most sizes.\nFor such a small piece of hardware, the fittings have\nthe potential to make a big difference. As Eckhardt says,\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA allowed us to have the technology and offer a\nbrand new product line to our customers, which could\nmake industry much safer.\xe2\x80\x9d v\n\nPublic Safety \t 81\n\n'
