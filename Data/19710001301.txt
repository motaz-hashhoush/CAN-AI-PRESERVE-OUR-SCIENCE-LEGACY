At present, the commonly\nused method of obtaining a large receiving aperture is to\nconstruct very large rigid reflectors which focus the intercepted energy at a single point where it is collected.\nThere are two primary disadvantages to this method which\nbecome apparent as the size of the reflector becomes very\nlarge (100-200 feet in diameter). These are: first, the\ntolerance to which the reflecting surface must be maintained becomes infeasible, and second, the beam width of\nthe antenna becomes so small that tracking the antenna\nbecomes a major problem.\nThe present invention is an economical ground based\nradio receiver which when used with an array of independent antennas can be made to have an extremely\nlarge effective antenna aperture for communicating with\ndeep space probes. The receiver operates from an array of independently steerable antennas and is capable\nof performing to the same threshold as a phase lock receiver operating from a single antenna with an effective\naperture equal to the sum of the effective apertures in\nthe array. The receiver will detect the avera,re amplitude, phase and frequency of the R F signals received on\nall the antennas in the array.\nThe difficulty in designing a receiver to operate\nfrom independently steerable antennas is due to the fact\nthat the angular modulation appearing on each individual\ninput is different. The modulation seen on the received\nsignals can be grouped into two categories. The first\ncategory is that portion of the modulation which is\ncommon to all inputs. This includes the intentional and\nincidental modulation created at the transmitter plus the\naverage Doppler shift or the Doppler shift seen at the array center. The second category is that portion of the\nmodulation which is peculiar to each individual input.\nThis includes the individual Doppler shift relative to the\naverage Doppler shift, wave front distortion caused by\nthe atmosphere, and delays introduced by amplifiers and\ncables. The receiver which constitutes this invention includes one primary phase lock loop for the detection of\nthe angular modulation which is common t o all inputs\nand a number of secondary phase lock loops for the detecaion of the modulation which is peculiar to each individual input.\nIt is therefore an object of this invention to provide\na receiver which can be used with an array of independently steerable antennas to provide a receiving system\nwith an extremely large effective receiving aperture.\nAnother object of this invention is to provide a receiver which is capable of utilizing all the signal power\nreceived on a number of antennas from the same source\nwithout requiring that the signals be phase coherent.\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\nA further object of this invention is to provide a receiver which will operate from an array of independently\nsteerable antennas and which includes one primary phase\nlock loop for the detection of the angular modulation\nthat is common to all inputs and a number of secondary\nphase lock loops for the detection of the modulation that\nis peculiar to each individual input.\nOther objects and a fuller understanding of this invention may be had by referring to the following specification\nand the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of a two-channel receiver which constitutes this invention; and\nFIG. 2 shows a block diagram of a maximal ratio signal\ncombiner which can be used with the recevier shown in\nFIG. 1.\nThe invention consists essentially of a multiple input\nradio receiver (each input is applied to a separate input\nchannel) with each of its inputs fed by an independently\nsteerable antenna. The receiver includes one primary\nphase lock loop for the detection of the angular modulation which is common to all inputs. The receiver also\nincludes a number of secondary phase lock loops, equal\nto the number of separate antennas used, for the detection\nof the modulation which is peculiar to each input. In the\nsecondary phase lock loops of the receiver, the amplitude\nand phtise of the individual inputs are detected. Then\nthese detected amplitiudes and phases are summed in an\noptimum manner to produce the average detected amplitude and phase of all incoming signals. The average\ndetected phase is then integrated and applied to a voltage\ncontrolled oscillator in the primary phase lock loop to\ncause it to track the average invcming phase.\nReferring now to FIG. 1 there is shown a two-channel\nradio receiver incorporating this invention. However, it\nshould be realized that any number of channels could\nbe used with this receiver to accommodate a like number of antennas. The two channels shown by FIG. 1\noperate exactly the same; therefore, only the upper channel will be described. The blocks in the lower channel\nare represented by the same numbers as the numbers\nrepresenting the corresponding blocks in the upper channel except the suffix n appears with each number.\nAntennas 10 and 10n are independently steered to\ntrack an object from which an RF signal is to be received.\nMeans for steering antennas to track objects are well\nknown and will, therefore, not be disclosed in this specification. Any RF signal intercepted by antenna 10 is\napplied to an RF amplifier 11 and then to a mixer 12.\nAlso applied to mixer 12 to produce any convenient\nfirst IF fraquency is a signal produced by a local oscillator\n13. It is necessary that the signal generated by local\noscillator 13 be applied to mixer 12 in all channels to\nmaintain frequency coherence. The first IF frequency\nis amplified by a first IF amplifier 14 and then applied\nto a mixer 15. Also applied to mixer 15 to produce a\nsecond IF frequency is a signal generated by a voltage\ncontrolled oscillator 30. The relative phase of the signal\ngenerated by oscillator 30 is the average of the phases\nof the signals intercepted by all antennas. This relative\nphase of oscillator 30 is maintained by a feedback signal\nwhich will be discussed later.\nThe signal intercepted by antenna 10 will have certain\nangular modulations which are present in all incoming\nsignals. These include the intentional and incidental\nmodulation created at the transmitter and the average\nDoppler shift or the Doppler shift seen at the array center.\nSince the signal generated by voltage controlled oscillator\n30 has a relative phase equal to the average of the phases\nof all incoming signals it also will have the modulation\nwhich is present in all incoming signals. Therefore, the\nsignal from oscillator 30 will subtract all ,of this angular\nmodulation from the signal intercepted by antenna 10.\n\n3,3311,832\n\n3\nExtremely small angular deviations (individual Doppler\nshift relative to average Doppler shift, wave front distortion caused by the atmosphere, and different phase\nshifts caused by amplifiers and cables) which are different\nfor each incoming signal will still remain with the signal\nat the output of mixer 15.\nThe output of mixer 15 is amplified by a second IF\namplifier 16 and then applied to a product detector 17\nand to a product detector 88. Also applied to product\ndetector I8 to produce a detected phase signal is a signal\ngenerated by a voltage controlled oscillator 19. The\ndetected phase signal is applied to oscillator 19 to lock\nit i phase with the signal applied to product detector\nn\n18. The signal generated by voltage controlled oscillator\n19 in addition to being applied to product detector 88,\nis shifted in phase by a 90" phase shifter 20 and then applied to product detector 17 to produce a detected amplitude signal. This detected amplitude signal is applied\nthrough an AGC amplifier and filter 21 to amplifiers 14\nand 16 to control their gains.\nIn the phase lock servo, which includes voltage controlled oscillator 19 and product detector 18, it is possible\nto use extremely narrow servo bandwidths (on the order\nof .01C.P.S. to 1.0 C.P.S. depending on the angular velocity\nof the source) resulting in linear signal detection to relatively high noise-to-signal ratios. The servo bandwidth\nof this phase lock loop does not affect the information\nor video bandwidth of the receiver in that the IF amplifiers 14 and 16, and product detector 18 can be made\nbroadband to accommodate relatively high frequency\nerror signals for the phase lock servo which includes\nvoltage controlled oscillator 30.\nIf the distance between antennas is appreciable (.l\nwavelength or greater of the highest modulation frequency to be received) it is necessary to use two variable\ndelay lines 22 and 23 to assure phase coherence of all\nincoming signals. These two delay lines are controlled\nby a delay computer 24. Delay computer 24 receives\ninput angular coordinates from antenna 10 and computes\nfrom these angular coordinates the delay necessary to\nmake the signals produced by product detectors 17 and\n18 phase coherent with the signals produced by the product detectors in all other channels.\nThe outputs from variable delay lines 22 for all input\nchannels are summed by a maximal ratio signal combiner 25 to produce an average detected amplitude modulation signal at an output terminal 26; and the outputs\nfrom variable delay lines 23 for all input channels are\nsummed by maximal ratio signal combiner 25 to produce\nan average detected phase modulation signal at an output\nterminal 27. The maximal ratio signal oomfbiner 25\ncontains circuitry for changing the amplitudes of the\nsignals applied to it so that the amplitudes of these signals\nare proportional to their signal-to-noise ratios. After\nthe amplitudes of the signals have been changed, they\nare then summed. A maximal ratio signal combiner\nsuitable for use as a maximal ratio signal combiner 29 is\ndisclosed by FIG. 2.\nThe signal at output terminal 27 is applied to a loop\nfilter 28 to integrate it and produce, at an output terminal\n29, an average detected frequency modulated signal for\nall channels. The signal at output terminal 29 is applied\nto voltage controlled oscillator 30 to modulate the signal\nproduced by it.\nReferring now to FIG. 2 there is shown a block diagram of a maximal ratio signal combiner which is suitable for use as maximal ratio signal combiner 25. This\nblock diagram also shows product detectors 17, 18, 17n,\nand 18n. Variable delay lines 22, 23, 22n, and 23n are\nnot shown connected between the product detectors and\nthe maximal ratio signal combiner. The outputs from\nproduct detectors 17,I%, 18, and 18n are applied to control multipliers 31, 32, 33, and 34, respectively. The outputs from control multipliers 31 and 32 are summed by\nan adder 35 to produce a signal at output terminal 26;\n\nand the outputs from control multipliers 33 and 34 are\nsummed by an adder 36 to produce a signal at output\nterminal 27. Adders 35 and 36 each produce an output\nsignal whose amplitude is equal to the average of the\n5 amplitudes of the input sicnals audied to it.\nThe outputs from control multipliers 31 and 32 are\napplied to noise detectors 37 and 38, respectively. These\nnoise detectors detect a portion of noise spectrum out of\neach channel and produce a D.C. signal proportional to\n10 the square of the noise. The output of adder 35 is integrated by an integrator 39 and then applied to noise\ndetectors 37 and 38 to control their gain. The outputs\nfnom noise detector 37 and control multiplier 31 are applied to a subtractor 40 which produces a signal propor15 tional t o their difference. This difference si\'gnal is integrated by an integrator 41 and then applied to control\nmultipliers 31 and 33 to control the gain of these multipliers. The outputs from noise detector 31 and control\nmultiplier 32 are applied to a subtractor 42 which pro20 duces a signal proportional to their difference. This difference signal is integrated by an integrator 41 and then\napplied to control multipliers 32 and 34 to control the gain\nof these multipliers. With this arrangement the signal-tonoise ratios at output terminals 26 and 27 are made to\n25 equal the sum of the signal-to-noise ratios of all the inputs to the receiver.\nI t will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the\nnovel principles of the invention disclosed herein in connection with the specific exemplification thereof will sug30 gest various other modifications and applications of the\nsame.
