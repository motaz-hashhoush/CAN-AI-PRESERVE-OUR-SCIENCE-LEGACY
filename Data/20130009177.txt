b"3.8\n\nCharles Swithinbank\n\nDr Charles Swithinbank is currently an Emeritus Associate of the Scott\nPolar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, England.\nDr. Swithinbank has been conducting research in the Earth\xe2\x80\x9fs Polar\nRegions since 1947, beginning with his participation in the Oxford\nUniversity Iceland Expedition. He was the youngest member of the\nNorwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition, spending 2\nconsecutive years with 15 other researchers and support staff at\nMaudheim Station. During this expedition, he participated in several\noversnow traverses measuring several hundred kilometers in extent and\nlasting for many weeks at a time. His polar expedition record stretches\ninto the 1990s. During these expeditions, Dr. Swithinbank has\nconducted research at British, U.S., and Russian stations in the\nAntarctic.\nDr. Swithinbank received a B.A. in geography in 1949, an M.A in\n1953, and a D.Phil. in glaciology in 1955 from the University of Oxford, Pembroke College. His work\nwith the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition continued through 1955. He then spent 4 years\nas a research fellow at the Scott Polar Research Institute, located at the University of Cambridge. From\n1959 through 1963, Dr. Swithinbank was a research associate and lecturer at the University of Michigan\n(where he earned his private pilot\xe2\x80\x9fs license). From 1963 through 1986, he worked for the British\nAntarctic Survey (a British government institute that is part of the Natural Environment Research\nCouncil), first as Chief Glaciologist (1963-74) and then as Head of Earth Sciences (1974-86). During this\ntime, he spent three winters and more than 20 field seasons in the Polar Regions. He continues to visit the\nPolar Regions frequently as a consultant for commercial expeditions in Arctic and Antarctic waters.\nSince 1986, Dr. Swithinbank has been an Emeritus Associate at the Scott Polar Research Institute,\nUniversity of Cambridge. He has been involved in the interpretation of satellite images of Antarctica,\nmapping, and the development of ice runways for transport aircraft.\nAmong his extensive professional activities, Dr. Swithinbank has been a member of the International\nCommission on Snow and Ice (Vice-President 1979-83), International Glaciological Society (President\n1981-84), and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (Life Member). He has\nreceived many awards from British, American, Scandinavian, and other organizations for his outstanding\ncontribution to a wide variety of studies of, and expeditions to, the Polar Regions. Among these awards\nare the King Haakon VII of Norway-Medal of Merit (1952), the Scott Polar Research Institute-Watkins\nAward (1953), the Queen Elizabeth II-Polar Medal (1956), the King Gustav VI of Sweden-Retzius Medal\n(1966), and the United States Antarctica Service Medal (1974).\n\n19\n\nA2 \xe2\x80\x93 Presentation of Charles Swithinbank\nParallels between Antarctic travel in 1950 and planetary travel in 2050\n[to accompany notes on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Norwegian British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition 1949-52\xe2\x80\x9d]\nCost of the expedition (Slide 1)\nNorway and Britain were recovering from World War II and food was still rationed. The total cost of the\n16-man 2\xc2\xbd-year expedition had to be less than \xc2\xa31 million (circa $40M today). Norway agreed to shoulder\n50% of the costs, Britain and Sweden 25% each.\nCapacity of the launch vehicle (Slide 6-7)\nThe only affordable vessel was Norsel, a 600-ton sealer owned by the skipper. All equipment and supplies\nhad to be jammed into the holds or carried on deck. Initially it was planned that the ship would go south\nin 1949 and only return in 1952 to evacuate us. In the event, the budget allowed Norsel also to come in\nthe middle summer season, bringing supplies, aircraft, and personnel.\nObjectives (Slides 2, 12, 21-22)\nTo explore as much as possible of 1 million km2 of unexplored territory. We were the first expedition to\nwinter in Antarctica between 95\xc2\xb0E and 57\xc2\xb0W - nearly half the coastline of Antarctica.\nIt was understood that we must be self-sufficient in every respect for 2\xc2\xbd years. There could be no firm or\ndetailed plans for inland exploration until we found where it was possible to make a landing.\nPersonnel (Slides 9-11, 21-22, 24-28, 32)\nLimited by cost and logistics to 15 men: 8 science and 7 support staff. This ratio meant that scientists had\nalso to serve in support capacities. The science staff was to consist of:\n(a) A topographic surveyor to provide ground control for aerial mapping. The prime duty of the first\nexplorer in any new land is to make a map showing what is there.\n(b) Two glaciologists. The initial impetus for the expedition came from a Swedish glaciologist who\nhad seen indications of glacier recession in aerial photographs taken by the Neu Schwabenland\nExpedition of 1938-39. His own work had documented contemporary glacier recession round the\nNorth Atlantic, which led to the question of whether climatic warming was also occurring in the\nsouthern hemisphere.\n(c) One geophysicist to measure the thickness of the ice sheet where possible. Contemporary\nspeculation was that the Antarctic ice sheet might be 300 m thick, whereas German work had\nclaimed ice thicknesses of 3,000 m in Greenland.\n(d) Two geologists. The idea of continental drift was a hot topic among earth scientists. We might\nfind critical evidence.\n(e) Two meteorologists. We could fill a vast gap between existing weather stations (>2,000 km in\nevery direction). Also weather forecasting was important for Norway\xe2\x80\x99s whaling industry.\nSelection of personnel (see Personnel)\nParticipation involved signing on for 2\xc2\xbd years; a 1-year expedition would have ruled out all but localized\nexploration. This limited the number of candidates. Four out of 15 were married. Selection was by\ninterview and medical examination. At that time, the idea of female participation was not even discussed.\nThe capacity of our small ship precluded any redundancy in staffing. In the event, three men drowned in\nFebruary 1951. The rest of us, qualified or not, had to take over their jobs.\n\n72\n\nInsurance\nPersonnel were not offered life insurance nor, to the best of my knowledge, did the unmarried members\ninsure themselves.\nAnalog training\nThis is vital (as with travel on other planets). Whilst only two out of 15 had ever been to the Antarctic,\nalmost all had worked in the Arctic. I had undergone winter and summer training in Iceland and Lapland\nand was taught crystallography by Max Perutz.\nMedical (Slides 24-28)\nWe had a young Swedish physician. He had to accept that in no emergency \xe2\x80\x93 however serious \xe2\x80\x93 could\nhelp be brought in from outside. Knowing that earlier expeditions had found that teeth rot in all climates,\nhe took a three-week course in dentistry and prepared for trauma of any kind \xe2\x80\x93 in men or dogs. He was\nnot found wanting. A geologist got a chip of rock in one eye and the eye had to be removed.\nSalary\nThe tripartite committee agreed that compensation should be no greater than the same person would have\nbeen paid at home. Some of the single men, myself among them, would have been happy to go without\nany pay. The money, we felt, would be better spent on equipment.\nLaunch pad (Slide 6)\nThe small foredeck of Norsel could only accommodate three Weasel tractors, a large ice coring drill, dog\nfood, spare parts and 62 sled dogs on top of it all. The rest of the upper deck was hidden under fuel\ndrums. Both holds were full and a crated aircraft sat on the after hatch with a second aircraft on top of it.\nThe Plimsoll line was below the waterline.\nThe base (Slides 3-9, 13, 37)\nThe coastline consisted of ice cliffs 20-25 m high \xe2\x80\x93 impossible to land on. We steamed from 5\xc2\xb0E to 12\xc2\xb0W\nsearching for a low point where the ship could unload. Finally we found one at 10\xc2\xb056\xce\x84W, far to the west\nof where we had hoped. Four hundred tonnes of cargo were unloaded and driven 3 km inland, where a\nbase was established on floating ice shelf. Food for 3 years was taken in case the ship was unable to reach\nthe base after the planned 2 years.\nOnly now did it become possible to make detailed plans. The science staff themselves decided on\npriorities in their own fields. This chain of events was as foreseen from the start of the expedition and\nproved best in the circumstances. In each pair of the science staff, one was senior and thus had the final\nsay. The seniors met with the leader to decide on who was to use which tractors or dog teams in each\nseason. Experiences gained in the first field season affected planning for the second. In the circumstances\nI can think of no better way.\nDiscipline on base was invisible. We worked from breakfast to supper with time only for a quick lunch.\nThe leader set a roster for domestic duties in which all staff had to take part. Work involved clearing the\nexits from drift snow, cutting and bringing in snow blocks to make water, washing dishes and sweeping\nout. We took pride in handling our science programs without help, but if help was asked (for heavy lifting\nor moving), it was willingly given.\nAviation (Slides 4, 23, 31)\nConstrained by what could be carried on Norsel and deployed while the ship was present. Two light\naircraft in each of three seasons. In 1949-50, two Austers of the Royal Air Force; in 1950-51 two\n\n73\n\nNorwegian-built aircraft crewed by Wider\xc3\xb8es Flyveselskap; and in 1951-52 two aircraft of the Royal\nSwedish Air Force. Together they took oblique aerial photographs covering some 100,000 km2. The\nWeasel crews were required to carry fuel inland to extend the range of the survey aircraft. Today the roles\nhave been reversed: aircraft fly fuel inland to extend the range of surface traverses.\nField work (Slides 14-23, 31-36)\nAfter an initial reconnaissance with dog teams seeking a crevasse-free route inland, all three weasels,\neach one hauling two tonnes, made two journeys to a point 300 km inland to establish an (unmanned)\nAdvance Base. Their cargoes consisted primarily of dog food, to facilitate lightweight scientific\nexcursions radiating out from the Advance Base into areas of scientific interest. All Antarctic expeditions\nbefore 1957 made depot-laying journeys to provide for longer scientific traverses later. I expect that\nsimilar non-scientific traverses will be necessary in advance of long-range science journeys on other\nplanets.\nRisks of travel (Slides 13-14, 18, 23, 29-30, 39, see also Medical)\nWe took risks - we knew we took them. Field radios at the time were low-powered and heavy.\nCommunication with base was rare. We had no communication with friends or family at home, and in my\nview, that was for the best. The only time we could rest with a clear conscience was in blizzards. On one\nlong journey we dumped the radio to be picked up later on our return, on the grounds that if we did have\nan emergency, nobody could reach us to help anyway.\nGeology (Slide 20)\nOur two geologists traveled far from the Advance Base during both field seasons. Carrying fuel supplies\n(dog food) for a month, man food (dehydrated) and rock specimens acquired along the way, they covered\na vast area. The surveyor drove his own dogs with the geophysicist as assistant. While the geologists were\nhacking away at rocks, the survey team lugged a theodolite up peaks to extend a triangulation network.\nGlaciology (Slides 21-22)\nThe glaciologists each had an assistant from the support staff, so they could either travel together or\ndivided into two parties to cover more ground. At each camp they dug a pit to determine the rate of snow\naccumulation, drilled (by hand) to a depth of 10 m to measure ice temperatures, and in places set up and\nsurveyed ice-movement markers to be resurveyed the following season.\nGeophysics (Slides 33, 34-36, 38)\nThe principal object was to determine the thickness of ice by seismic sounding \xe2\x80\x93 the only means known at\nthe time. After experiments as far as the Advance Base in the 1950-51 summer, both Weasels were\ndevoted to a seismic sounding traverse in 1951-52 as far inland as supplies would allow. The party\nreached 620 km inland and found ice thicknesses of 2,500 m.\nConflicts\nThere was competition for use of the Weasels, particularly after was one of the three machines was lost in\nan accident. Apart from that, we solved our differences amicably. On returning to England, our Leader\nwrote in The Times of London (19 Feb 1952): \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think there has ever been a polar expedition with\nso little friction between members.\xe2\x80\x9d My own opinion is that, other things being equal, once away from\nhome an international expedition encounters fewer difficulties than would a national expedition. Each one\nof us, to the best of our ability, leaned over backwards to suppress our national prejudices and\npreconceptions. That, surely, was the key to our success.\n\n74\n\nI do not recall any occasion on which the senior man from one country convened a meeting to discuss a\nnational policy. It helped that the meteorology program involved a Norwegian and a Swede; glaciology\nand geophysics had Swedish, British, and Australian participants; and the geology/survey program had\nCanadian, British and Norwegian members. We knew that any alignment based on nationality would be\ndisruptive, and that the success or failure of the expedition would be judged by its scientific results.\nSequelae (Slides 40-44)\nAdvance depot-laying generally fell out of favor because of the availability of aircraft.\nSeismic sounding became an important part of the International Geophysical Year (1957-58). It was\nsuperseded by airborne radar sounding in 1966 when I flew an early version over the Antarctic Peninsula.\nLater work used C-121J, LC-130 and DHC-6 aircraft. Forty years later a similar instrument was used for\nsounding the Polar Ice Caps of Mars.\n\n75\n\nCHARLES SWITHINBANK\n\nNORWEGIAN-BRITISH-SWEDISH\nANTARCTIC EXPEDITION\n1949-52\n\nCS 24 July 2009 1\n\nb\n\nBuenos Aires Herald (10 March 1949)\n76\n\n2\n\nIce front (20 m\n\nhigh)\n\nAuster taking off to search the ice front for a dock\n77\n\n3\n\n4\n\nMaudheim (Jan 1951)\n\n5\n\nIce dock (Jan 1950)\n6\n\n78\n\nMaudheim 3 days old\n\n7\n\nPlan of Maudheim,\nour habitat for two\nyears\n\n8\n\n79\n\nLunch\n\nIce coring to\n100 m depth\n\n9\n\n10\n\n80\n\nIce crystal\nstudies in cold lab\nat -20\xc2\xba C\n11\n\nSt John's Evening Telegram (15 Sep 1950)\n81\n\n12\n\nMain habitat after the first winter\n\nDogfights were common\n82\n\n13\n\n14\n\nSlow going with 500 kg on the sledge\n\nTravel habitat\n(note hand-cranked generator for radio)\n83\n\n15\n\n16\n\nWeasel hauling 2 tonnes (mostly dogfood)\n\nCrevasse!\n84\n\n17\n\n18\n\nWeasels approaching mountains\n\nThe Advance Base at Pyramiden\n85\n\n19\n\n20\n\nWe drilled to 10 m at every\ncamp for ice temperatures\n\n21\n\nMeasuring snow density and annual layers\n86\n\n22\n\nHow pilots\nlearn about\nwhiteout\n\n23\n\nDr Wilson\n(veterinary)\nsurgeon\n\n24\n\n87\n\nDr Wilson (cranial surgeon)\n\nDr Wilson (dental surgeon)\n88\n\n25\n\n26\n\nDr Wilson (eye surgeon)\n\nJohannesburg Star (2 October 1951)\n89\n\n27\n\n28\n\nHallgren swam\nto an ice floe\n\n29\n\nCalcutta Statesman (25 April 1951)\n90\n\n30\n\nBeechcraft 18R of the Royal Swedish Air Force\n\nYarning\n\n31\n\n32\n\n91\n\nSeismic traverse heading south (10 Nov 1951)\n\nMars traverse (Rawlings 2007)\n92\n\n33\n\n34\n\nIn seismic caboose\n\nFarthest south (Dec 1951)\n93\n\n35\n\n36\n\nMaudheim (Feb 1952)\n\n37\n\n600 km seismic traverse\n(Nature, Vol. 171, 1953, p. 55)\n\n38\n\n94\n\nJohannesburg Star (14 Sept 1951)\n\nFirst airborne radar sounding (12 Jan 1967)\n1965\n95\n\n39\n\n40\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Super-Constellation\xe2\x80\x99 (C-121J) with 35 MHz antenna (Dec 1967)\n\nLC-130 ice radar antenna (Dec 1978)\n96\n\n41\n\n42\n\n150 MHz antenna on Twin Otter\n(Jan 2009)\n\n43\n\n44\n\n97\n\n"
