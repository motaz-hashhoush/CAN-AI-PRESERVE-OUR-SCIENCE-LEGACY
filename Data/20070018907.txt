b'Five Year Flashlight An ultra-reliable flashlight,\ninitially developed for rescue signaling and utility\nuse by NASA astronauts and military aircrews,\nhas attracted a broad commercial market.\nCalled the Five Year Light, it has a shelf life at\nleast that long because there is no power drain\non the batteries when the flashlight is not in use.\nThe NASA version of the light was developed under contract with Langley Research\nCenter by ACR Electronics, Inc., now known as\nthe Chromalloy Electronics Division of Chromalloy American Corporation, Hollywood, Florida.\nNASA wanted a light that had long shelf life and\n\nassured reliability in case it was needed in an\nemergency. Reliability was designed into the\nflashlight by means of a unique switch. Instead\nof the customary thumb-button, the Five Year\nLight is turned on by rotating its collar to make\ncontact with the battery terminal; the turning\nmotion wipes away any corrosion that might be\npresent and makes contact virtually certain.\nThe Five Year Light available commercially\nis a repackaged version of the NASA light. It is\nsold for car, home, industrial, police, firefighting,\nrecreational and a variety of other uses, and\nsales have topped two million units.\n\n'
