b'Interview questions with Bentham Scientific,\nhttp://www.benthamscience.com/bensci/\nSubmitted by email, Sept. 2013\n1. We would like to hear about your childhood. Can you share some good memories from it?\nYes: I grew up on a research farm of Rutgers University, and my father studied dairy cows,\nwhile my mother taught elementary school. I had a lot of time to do what I wanted to do and\nI had no duties on the farm. I read as much as I could about science and math, and astronomy\ncaught my attention, then electronics and physics. I was really excited to visit the planetarium\nand the Museum of Natural History in New York City, and it was easy to see that astronomy\nwas interesting and mysterious, and that evolution was a demonstrated fact. A child of 8 can\neasily understand it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that some religious authorities have denied the\nobvious evidence, much to the detriment of their credibility. My parents read aloud to my\nsister and me from biographies of Darwin and Galileo, and they were heroes to me. They\nshowed me that scientific discovery was both noble and dangerous. My grandfather was a\nscientist too, a bacteriologist who helped learn how to produce penicillin.\n2. Tell us briefly about your journey towards your profession? What sparked your interest in\nPhysics? Answer: In my public high school in rural New Jersey, I had a great introduction to\nphysics and math, and I read a lot. Also, my parents found a couple of summer schools I\ncould go to, that were sponsored by the National Science Foundation. One, when I turned 16,\nwas in mathematics, at Assumption College. The next year there was one in physics at\nCornell University. They were both thrilling, but I could see that other students were far\nahead of me in math. I could also see that there were mysteries that were just now being\nrevealed and solved, and I saw that I was pretty good at physics, and might have a chance to\nparticipate and maybe win as a professional. In high school there was a statewide physics\ncontest in New Jersey and I won first place, which was a great encouragement to continue. In\ncollege I did very well on all the physics and astronomy classes, which again was\nencouragement to continue. But in graduate school, my thesis project failed to function, and I\nhad to write about an instrument that did not work. Nevertheless, it paved the way for my\nNobel Prize work.\n3. Can you tell us about the work you did on the Big Bang which won you the Nobel Prize?\nHow did you collaborate with George Smoot to work with you on your research? Answer: As\na young postdoc, I was the original person who suggested we build the Cosmic Background\nExplorer Satellite, and my advisor suggested that we call three other key people to form a\nteam. My idea was that my thesis project should have been done in outer space. Our proposal\nwas submitted, and NASA later chose some of us to form a new team, along with members\nof two other teams. One of those was Dr. Smoot. I became the Project Scientist, a NASA\nposition that meant that I worked with the engineering teams to build the observatory, and I\nwas also the principal investigator of the instrument that we used to measure the spectrum of\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation. With that instrument we measured the\nspectrum of the background radiation to a precision of 50 parts per million, which was far\nbetter than we had ever hoped we could do. It fits the theoretical prediction of a perfect\nblackbody spectrum extremely well. The instrument was a direct descendent of the one that\n\ndid not work for my thesis project. Smoot was chosen to be PI of the instrument that would\nmap the radiation, but that instrument was built at Goddard Space Flight Center like the\nothers, so as Project Scientist I had an oversight role for it, as well as over Dr. Smoot. That\ninstrument was a descendent of several versions that had been used on the ground, on balloon\npayloads, and on aircraft, but its special advantage was being in outer space, far above the\ninterference of the Earth and its atmosphere. With that instrument the team discovered that\nthe map has hot and cold spots on it at a level of about 10 parts per million (root mean\nsquare). That difference is just what is needed to explain the structure of the universe we see\ntoday.\n4. At what point did you start believing that your theory was right? Answer: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a\ntheory, although I was pretty well aware that the expanding universe (the grossly misnamed\nhot Big Bang) was the popular theory. I am an observational scientist. Our measurements\nsupported this theory against all competitors, such as the Steady State Theory, which is now\nvery clearly wrong. Our data were extraordinarily precise and they fit the Big Bang theory\nperfectly, if one is allowed to include exotic ideas like dark matter and dark energy that\ncannot be observed directly on Earth.\n5. How did it feel to finally be acknowledged in such a universal way? Answer: It was\noverwhelming for me and intensely satisfying for the 1500 people who put their hearts into\nmaking the satellite work and figuring out what the data meant.\n6. Professor U.R. Rao, former Chairman ISRO, has said that it may take another 1000 years to\ncolonize Mars. Do you think it is an accurate prediction? Answer: No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will\never happen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any way in which such a colony could be economically viable in the\nway that terrestrial colonies were centuries ago. I can see that we can send people there\ntemporarily for touristic or scientific reasons, but we will have to live in airtight bubbles and\nonly go out rarely, otherwise we will die of cosmic radiation damage. However, I could\nimagine a future in which robotic intelligent life might find value in going to Mars and\nsucceed in doing so. Robots don\xe2\x80\x99t have to breathe and they don\xe2\x80\x99t mind so much being cold or\ngetting bombarded by cosmic rays. So they could live perfectly well on Mars if they want to.\nTerraforming is probably not totally impossible but would require many technical marvels.\n7. Advances in understanding human biology & disease are opening up exciting new\npossibilities for breakthrough medicine; would you like to share your knowledge in this\naspect? Answer: I only know that every week brings astonishing discoveries, ranging from\nthe molecular level to worldwide system. But it seems that the most important and least\nexpensive thing we can do for our personal health is to avoid addictions to dangerous\nbehaviors (like fighting and surfing the Internet and watching TV) and substances (like\ntobacco and excessive salt, sugar, fat, and alcohol).\n8. Which projects are you currently working on? Answer: The James Webb Space Telescope is\nmy current main interest. It is the planned successor to the great Hubble Space Telescope,\nextending its discoveries to greater distances in space, closer to the formation of the first stars\nand galaxies, and looking into how stars like the Sun and planets like the Earth were formed\nand became capable of supporting life. The JWST could help us understand how we got here\n\nand where we are going, and of course whether we are alone in the universe, or might have\nintelligent company elsewhere.\n9. The ongoing research seems to be exhausted in most fields and yet the world encounters\ndiversified problems replicated out of one problem. Are you optimistic about science that it\ncan still accomplish to change the world? Answer: The premise that ongoing research seems\nexhausted in most fields is just wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that some areas of science are now mature in\nthe sense that it takes great effort to make additional fundamental discoveries; for example,\nMaxwell\xe2\x80\x99s equations describe electricity and magnetism perfectly and have already done so\nfor around 150 years. But the application of those equations to scientific and technical\nchallenges is still fascinating and astonishingly successful. I am writing to you on a laptop\ncomputer that embodies brilliant recent discoveries in basic physics as well as incredible\napplications of engineering talent, provided by organizations that have been built up from\nnothing in only a few years. So yes, science and engineering continue to change the world.\nThe global challenges we face can be managed only through the continued investigation that\nis the hallmark of science, and the respect for evidence that leads to success.\n10. How has the citation practice of authors changed in the past few decades? What factors\ninfluence author\xe2\x80\x99s citation practices? Answer: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\n11. The idea of open access publication has received much attention from the authors. What is\nyour opinion about this? Do you support this? Answer: Yes I do. But somebody has to pay\nfor the work, both the research and the publication. In science, most fundamental research is\nsupported by governments and paid for by taxes, so it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the public has a right to\nknow promptly what has been done with their money. But in many areas, scientific and\nengineering research is supported by organizations that seek to profit from the results. That\nwork is unlikely to become open access very soon. And of course, some research is opposed\nby organizations that profit from pretending not to know the right answers. The tobacco and\nfossil fuel industries comes to mind.\n12. How has the internet revolution changed the way in which you worked in your field?\nAnswer: I spend my life typing instead of talking with people!\n13. Is diversity the key to success in contemporary science? What could motivate one to create a\nNobel worthy future? Answer: Diversity of thought is essential to discovery! One can\xe2\x80\x99t\ndiscover something new by thinking the same was as everyone else. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\nlook different to be different inside. Conversely I am really impressed that brilliant scientists\nare now appearing from so many different countries. As you know scientists are able to\nmigrate like fish and birds to where they have the best opportunities to work. For now many\nare still migrating to the western nations but rapidly growing research programs in Asia,\nAfrica, and Latin America are paying off for those areas too. I expect Nobel-worthy\ndiscoveries to come increasingly from the new economies where new scientific and\nengineering challenges are being met.\n14. How can research in your field contribute to the process of socio-economic development &\nGlobal peace? Answer: Astrophysics is as far removed from practical application as possible.\n\nHowever, scientists as a group are already a worldwide community with a kind of\ngovernment, in which the truth will eventually triumph, and the truth is decided by nature,\nnot by vote. If the world could be equally well governed, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be interesting?\n15. Any advice that you would like to give to scientists from the developing world? Answer: I\nwould think that scientific and engineering problems are all around us, in all parts of the\nworld. Who does not need clean water, clean air, good food, good shelter, good work, and\ngood friends and family? The scientific method is to systematically search for evidence of\nwhat works, and I think such a method could apply to almost every area of life, in all parts of\nthe world.\n\n'
