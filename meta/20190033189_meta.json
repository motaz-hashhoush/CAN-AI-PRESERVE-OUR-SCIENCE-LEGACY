We analyzed liver transcriptomic and proteomic data from three mouse spaceflight experiments flown aboard the International Space Station (Rodent Research-1 NASA (RR-1 NASA), Rodent Research-1 CASIS (RR-1 CASIS), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3)), and one mouse experiment flown on the Space Shuttle (Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) aboard STS-135). Despite the differences in genetic background and time of exposure to microgravity it was shown through Oil Red staining and histology that increased lipid accumulation was occurring in the liver of all mice flown in space compared to the ground controls. This led to further pursue the existing GeneLab datasets related to liver omics data from these mice. We were able to discover key conserved pathways across all the mice independent of the flight conditions that were related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, both lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions which include ESR1, GCG, and NR1I2 being inhibited and INS being activated. Interestingly, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression has been known to be heavily involved with lipoprotein metabolism. In addition, insulin (INS) is the primary driver for fat metabolism and increased INS has been associated with increased fatty acids in the liver. Through additional proteomic analysis we were able to identify the majority of the key proteins related to lipids for both the RR-1 and RR-3 rodents were being up-regulated in the livers when comparing flight to ground controls. This additional confirmation of the lipid associated activity also showed that the lipid related proteins are heavily involved with lipid metabolism, cholesterol binding, and cholesterol metabolism. Lastly, the analysis also revealed that the circadian clock related pathways in the liver are commonly being increased across all space flight conditions which has also been reported in the literature to potentially cause increased liver damage. The combination of the very strong lipid uptake in the liver and the transcriptomic/proteomic signatures (including the circadian clock pathways) following spaceflight are consistent with early onset of liver disease. Taken together, these data indicate that, activation of lipotoxic pathways could persist during longer duration spaceflight which might result in the development of liver disease", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190033189, "endDate": "2019-11-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)", "location": "Springfield, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "12708c7af5334f71b5604a1405b5cc27", "id": "12a874519a774fd09ae9fe7f0c449d62"}], "name": "Annual Meeting of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR)", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "12708c7af5334f71b5604a1405b5cc27", "startDate": "2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190033189, "id": "0681bcde02354e489098d3e6b4e01717", "publicationDate": "2019-11-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190033189.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190033189/downloads/20190033189.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190033189/downloads/20190033189.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190033189/downloads/20190033189.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
