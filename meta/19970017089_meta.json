The technology innovations implemented in the CMS provide the infrastructure required for operations cost reduction and future development cost reduction through increased operational efficiency and reuse in future missions. The command management design facilitates error-free operations which enables the automation of the routine control center functions and allows for the distribution of scheduling responsibility to the instrument teams. The reusable system was developed using object oriented methodologies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "2", "submissionId": 19970017089, "id": "8cc5c7b4b17e49bd920ad85f3d27b86d", "publicationName": "Proceedings of 4th International Symposium on Space Mission Operations and Ground Data Systems, volume 2", "publicationDate": "1996-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
