F o r purposes of comparison we\ns h a l l use the hypersonic wake, (4) A t the outset, it should be noted that\nequations (18)- (20) have no dissipation t e r m s .\n\nSuch terms undoubeediy\n\ncome into a higher o r d e r approximation of the plasma equations.\n\nBut\n\nthe next higher approximation to (18)-(20) reqyiree detailed knowledge\nof fe(\xe2\x80\x99),\n\nand the calculation of\n\nfe(\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nappears quite difficult.\n\nIn view of this difficulty, we compare equations (18)-(20j to the\ninviscid (Euler) equations.\n\nConsider f o r comparison a n eddy in the\n\nhypersonic wake to be a lump of fluid surrounded by thin @hearlayers.\nIt is known(4) that the density changes in this eddy a r e negligible.\n\nThus,\n\nthe flow inside the eddy may be considered incompressible, to f i r s t approximation.\n\nThe dissipation occurs in tF.e s h r a r l a y e r s which enclose the eddy.\n\nHence the flow inside is irrotational.\nfying Lap1acr:s equation.\n\nThere is a velmity potential\n\n4 satis-\n\nThe internal flow is specified by giving either the\n\n-\n\n13\n\n-\n\nnormal o r tangential velocity on the boundary of the eddy.\n\nThe fundamental\n\nfeature of this description is that any size o r shape of eddy is allowed, as\nthe solution ot the boundary value problem posed above always exists and is\nunique.\nIn a similar vein, we a s k if such latitude is available in equations\n(18H20). A s , to some o r d e r , there is dissipation asqociated with rotational\nmagnetic o r velocity fields, the ques5on amounts to examining the c l a s s of\nirrotational solutions permitted by (38-20).

F r e m this, it follows that Alfvgn waveb may not\nbe ignored in the dynamics uf afi d d y (in cnzfrasf: to the hypersonic c a s e\nwhere acoustic waves w e r e unimportant inside an eddy).\n\nThe reason that\n\nno nontrivial irrotational motions exist inside a closed eddy is thst the\nequations a r e hyperbolic.\n\nSolutions exist only for problems posed\n\ninitial line, not a closed surface.\nrotational\n\n01\nx\n\nan\n\nThese solutjons a r e , i n general,\n\n.\n\nThus the concept of vortex stretching in equations (18-20) is a l s o\nsignificantly different f r o m that in a viscous fluid.\n\nThis is m o s t easily\n\nseen in the case where the density fl-!.2c:t&tiono a r e small.\n\ne =6 t $ / G , =e-$,\'-.\ne\n\nThenif\n\nIn that case, set\n\n-\n\n14\n\n-\n\nan equation f o r ths;evolution o r and s can be wtitten a s (5)\nf\n\n[ma\n\nt curl r x Q\n\n1\n\n+\n\na\n\nt[-bi-\n\ncurl s x P\n\n= o\n\n1\n\n(35)\n\nAssuming the r i s almost always z e r o in regions where s i s non-zero leads\n\nt o the idea that r i s stretched by Q and s by P.\nConsider a coordinate system moving with the mean velocity, U.\nAssume that the mean value of the magnetic field is non-zero.\na disturbance c r e a t e s\n\n\'J:\n\nIf, a t t = 0,\n\nand s , a c c o r d n g to ( 3 5 ) , the r and 6 filaments will\n\ntend to separate with a mean velocity & i\n\nPP\n\n(bar denotes mean value).\n\nthis happens, the mechanism for stretching s by P becomes linear, f o r ,\nif r and s a r e spparated by large distance, the irregularities in P caused\n\nby variations in r will not be felt by the s filaments, and vice versa.\n\nThus,\n\ni f the mean magnetic field i s non-zero in the wake, the random rotational\n\nelements in the flow separate, and, after z long time, a r e convected with\nthe mean magnetic field,\n\nin this circumstance, a cascade can proceed\n\nonly through stretching by mean field gradients.\n\nFrom section UI, we\n\nanticipated that mean field gradients in the wave may be small.\nThere i s every reason to belikve q a t a cascade does exist.\n\nThe above\n\nis an argument that the mean magnetic field in the turbulent wake of the\n\nmoon should be n e a r zero: let B =\np a r t of B.\n\nThen\n\nd v \' 1 % <<\n037\n\nB\n\nt B\'\n\n, where\n\nB\' is the fluctuating\n\n1, s o that the Alfvgn waves a r e propa-\n\ngated mainly by the instantaneous magnetic field rather than its mean value.\nThis i s in rough agreement with Ness\' results.\nBecause the vortex stretching mechanism is very different f r o m the\nclassical c a s e , and because eddies cannot exist with the same f o r m that\nthey have in the classical case, one should expect the random three\ndimensional ugsteady flow governed b y (18-20) possess features not\n\n-\n\n15\n\n-\n\nanalogous to turbulence a s it ~ c c a r in\ns\n\nif\n\nviszous fluid.\n\n.\n\nFinally, it seems worthwhile to point out that Cohen(6) has\nshown that the s o l a r w5x-d has f l u c h a t i n n s\ni s roughly c--parable\n\nOR\n\nthe s c a l e of 800 km, which\n\nwith the scales of IT-otion seen b y Ness.\n\nIf most\n\nstars have s o l a r winds, and if r h o s t s o l a r w h d s a r e turbulent, and if the\nspeculations of this section apply, about half the m a t t e r in the universe\nis i n this s o r t of turbulent mation.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank the staff of the Ionosphere\nResearch Laboratory, The Pennsylvania State University, for\ntheir help in preparing this m a n u s c r i p t g and Dr. J.

Nature 208 (1965), 277, Cohen finds a\nscintillation spectrum o x radio source a s observed through\nthe solar wind. This spectrum is roughly gaussian with a\ncharacteristic width of about 1 / 2 cps. Combining this with\na mean velocity of 400 k m / s e c gives a n eddy size of 800 k m ,\n\n-\n\n1\n(\n\n;.*.;;.I;\n,\n\n.......:.. . . .. . . .\n.\n\n..,\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n-\n\nL\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\n-3\n\n~ . . ~\ni\n\n.c. .\n.x\n\n..\n\nI\n\nFOR LARGE z, THE GRADIENT\n\nOF THE RADIAL FIELD IS\n\nSMALL,\n\nO(y)\n\n...\n\na\n\n'
