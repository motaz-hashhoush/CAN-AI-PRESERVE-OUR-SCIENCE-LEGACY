The selection of the material depends on the heat flux, heat load, pressure, and shear and other mechanical loads imposed on the material, which are in turn determined by the vehicle configuration and size, location on the vehicle, speed, a trajectory, and the atmosphere. In all cases the goal is to use a material that is both reliable and efficient for the application. Reliable materials are well understood and have sufficient test data under the appropriate conditions to provide confidence in their performance. Efficiency relates to the behavior of a material under the specific conditions that it encounters TPS that performs very well at high heat fluxes may not be efficient at lower heat fluxes. Mass of the TPS is a critical element of efficiency. This talk will review the major classes of TPS, reusable or insulating materials and ablators. Ultra high temperature ceramics for sharp leading edges will also be reviewed. The talk will focus on the properties and behavior of these materials.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120002684, "endDate": "2011-09-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "HI TEMP 2011 Conference", "location": "Boston, MA", "id": "ce34dfba4e5d43ada3ff859ce293a72c", "startDate": "2011-09-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120002684, "id": "86e06c31d94b4b03839928bb7cd56b10", "publicationDate": "2011-09-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120002684.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120002684/downloads/20120002684.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120002684/downloads/20120002684.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120002684/downloads/20120002684.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
