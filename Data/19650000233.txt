Previous\nmethods involved the use of a combined heat source\nand mold. This both limited the length of tubing that\ncould be processed in one operation and made wall\nthickness and uniformity difficult to control.\nThe solution: To draw round tubing over a shaped\nplug or mandrel following suitable heating of the tubing to soften the glass. In this method there is no restriction on tube length and wall thickness and uniformity are readily controlled.\nHow it's done: A graphite forming plug is inserted\ninto one end of the round tubing that is to be formed.\nThe bottom of the plug is positioned just below the\nhot zone of the furnace, and the tube drawing holder\nis attached to the end of the tubing.\n\nAs the screw of the tube drawing holder turns, it\npulls the tubing over the plug after the glass has been\nsoftened in the furnace. The feed screw on the other\nend of the tubing turns slower than the drawing screw.\nThe ratio of the two screw speeds determines the wall\nthickness of the finished tubing. The tubing flows\naround the plug and takes the shape of the plug. The\ntubing is annealed after drawing to prevent cracking.\nThe forming plug may be made of solid graphite cut to\nthe correct shape or may be graphite with an inner\nmetal cooling jacket through which water circulates.\nVarious tubing shapes are possible in one pass\nthrough the furnace. For example, hexagonal, triangula, square, and irregular curved surfaces may be made\nwith this method. Tubing shapes with reentrant\ncorners such as a four-pointed star can be made in a\ntwo-step process. The tubing is first formed into a\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

This process has been successfully used to draw\nirregularly shaped tubing with an original wall\nthickness of 0.070-inch down to a wall thickness\nof 0.010-inch.\n2. There are many applications for inexpensive, irregularly shaped tubing. As one example, a fluorescent tube could be shaped to deliver maximum\nlight in a specific direction.\n\nBrief 65-10235\t\n\n3.
