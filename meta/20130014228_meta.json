High-Z material with excellent stopping power. Fabricated using a combination of laser micromachining and chemical etching. Known technology capable of producing high-aspect ratio holes and large open fractions. Reduces LOFT LAD background by a factor of 3. Telemetry formats for LOFT based upon RXTE/EDS experience. Ground system software and strategies for WFM based upon RXTE/ASM automated pipeline software. MSFC engineering trade studies supporting the Ta collimator. Burst alert triggers based upon Fermi/GBM and HETE-2. Science Enhancements Enabled by US Hardware include: Tantalum collimator: Reduces background by factor of 3. Improves sensitivity to faint sources such as AGN. Eliminates contamination by bright/variable sources. outside the LAD field of view. US Ground Station: Enables continuous telemetry of all events from the WFM. Allows LAD to observe very bright >500 mCrab sources with full event resolution.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20130014228, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4f1e383ef9c9487a912b03644d794278", "id": "100641d49a4e41f9abaae59ba24e6718"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4f1e383ef9c9487a912b03644d794278", "id": "ae5d1553b8d84ded99b5c0ed5026f0ff"}], "name": "Large Observatory for X-Ray Timing (LOFT) Science Meeting", "location": "Rome", "id": "4f1e383ef9c9487a912b03644d794278"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130014228, "id": "b765c7cc1c3a4a7fb6e4c3e295518d46", "publicationDate": "2013-04-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130014228.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130014228/downloads/20130014228.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130014228/downloads/20130014228.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130014228/downloads/20130014228.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
