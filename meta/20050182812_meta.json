Of major importance was the 1995 launch of the Optical Transient Detector (OTD), followed in 1997 by the launch of the Lightning Imaging Sensor &IS). Together, these instruments have generated a continuous nine-year record of global lightning activity. These lightning observations have provided a new global perspective on total lightning activity. For the first time, total lightning activity (cloud-to-ground and intra-cloud) has been observed over large regions with high detection efficiency and accurate geographic location. This has produced new insights into lightning distributions, times of occurrence and variability. It has produced a revised global flash rate estimate (45 flashes per second) and has lead to a new realization of the significance of total lightning activity in severe weather.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050182812, "endDate": "2005-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Cosmosphere and Space Center", "location": "Wichita, KA", "id": "3c71ec5ba40b4cbebebc929616f2960b", "startDate": "2005-04-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050182812, "id": "7982f5823692471aba9675530b109597", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
