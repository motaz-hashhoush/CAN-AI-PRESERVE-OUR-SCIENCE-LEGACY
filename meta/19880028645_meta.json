The approach emphasizes the analysis of evolution paths, driven by specific user requirements, and evolution modes, i.e., the infrastructure required to support the evolution paths. The objective is to determine the near-term actions that must be taken to protect the future options. These include the identification of evolution 'hooks and scars' on the baseline Space Station and the establishment of an evolution advanced development program. The near term emphasis of the evolution planning is on methods of increasing the efficiency and productivity of the Space Station and on requirements to support new initiatives currently being studied by NASA.", "title": "Evolutionary Space Station infrastructure", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T14:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880028645, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Diaz, Alphonso V."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "de35a12ed1164a568424099c2260ccd0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880028645, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Askins, Barbara S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Office of Space Station", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "8d261cb478bb4cfda4a6c5e9b9144d45"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880028645, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880028645, "id": "5989347edd22473a88caf05d10a8ec98", "publicationDate": "1987-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
