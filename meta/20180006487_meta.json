Although great progress has been made, there remain several key problems where more data are required to constrain modelling, both empirical and thermodynamics-based. Here I will focus on several areas with implications for meteoritics and planetary science, including systems of low fO2 (Oxygen fugacity), constructing models that include both metal and silicate for mantle melting and differentiation, high pressure phase equilibria relevant to full range of silicate mantles, and core-mantle equilibria where H and O are specified, and their effects are measured.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Russia", "submissionId": 20180006487, "endDate": "2018-07-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Meteoritical Society", "location": "Chantilly, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a89b33ecfd5c49aea2c1442c6eccb070", "id": "7bb3420500aa405485094248ef911437"}], "name": "Annual Meeting of The Meteoritical Society", "location": "Moscow", "id": "a89b33ecfd5c49aea2c1442c6eccb070", "startDate": "2018-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180006487, "id": "d867183c28164b7182bb5cd452047c5b", "publicationDate": "2018-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180006487.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180006487/downloads/20180006487.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180006487/downloads/20180006487.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180006487/downloads/20180006487.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
