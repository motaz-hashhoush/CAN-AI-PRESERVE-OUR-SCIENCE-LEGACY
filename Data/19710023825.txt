General Operations\nBarbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX) was\na national program, the first of a series of large-scale research\nprojects planned by nations of the world under the Global Atmospneric\nResearch Program (GARP).\nThe scientific objectives of BOMEX were described in BOMEX Bulletin\nNumber 4. Briefly, the goal was to study the sea-air interaction, which\ndrives the atmosphere\'s circulation and global weather systems. The\nsea-air interface has been described as the scene of a complex and continuous exchange of energy, water, gases, and particulates.\nMost of the heat received from the sun is stored in the tropical\noceans between latitudes 30 o South and 30 oNorth. In contrast, the\nearth loses heat by radiation almost uniformly at all latitudes, so\nheat has to be transported from equatorial regions to higher latitudes.\nStrangely enough, this transport is not done by the ocean, but primarily\nby the atmosphere. This process, of which relatively little is known,\nseems to occur in three stages. First, the energy in the ocean is\ntransferred to the atmosphere in a turbulent boundary layer about\n6,000 feet thick. Most of this energy moves from ocean to air as\nlatent heat in the form of water vapor. Next, the energy finds its\nway.from the boundary layer to the upper layers of the troposphere.\nFinally, it is transported to higher latitudes by fast-moving air\ncurrents, sometimes in the nature of jet streams.\n\n-1-\n\nBOMEX\'s objective was to explore the first two steps in the\ntransport process. Data were collected to examine in detail the\nexchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere and the vertical and horizontal transport of these enerRies within each fluid.\nESSA -- as the lead agency for BOMEX -.-- coordinated and directed\nthe experiment through the BOMEX Project Office and the control\ncenter on Barbados.\nSeven Federal departments and independent agencies; universities, and six industrial research laboratories in the United\nStates, Canada, and Barbados participated in BOMEX with the cooperation of the Government of Barbados. The U.S. Government\nparticipants were:\nDepartment of Commerce\n(Environmental Science Services Administration);\nDepartment of Defense\n(Air Force, Army, Navy, and National Guard);\nDepartment of the Interior\n(Bureau of Commercial. Fisheries);\nDepartment of Transportation\n(Coast roiard) ;\nAtomic Energy Commission;\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the\nNational Science Foundation.\nIn all, an armada of 12 ships, 28 planes, and 1500 scientists\nand technicians converged on Barbados at the beginning of May 1969,\nto conduct this most difficult and complex scientific research program.\nThe initial BOMEX array (May and June) was a square bounded by\nfour Coast & Geodetic Survey ships -- the OCEANOGRAPHER, DISCOVERER,\nMT. MITCHELL, and RAINIER - with the Coast Guard Cutter ROCKAWAY\nstationed at the ce\xc2\xb0*_er. The five ships were provided with special\ninstrumentation and supplies during March and April. This included\nsignal conditioning and recording devices, sensor equipment, meteorological booms, boundary layer instrument packages, and free-fall\nmooring systems. The signal conditioning and recording devices\n(SCARD) recorded the basic data taken by the shipboard and oceanographic instruments.\n\n-2-\n\ne\n\nSome difficulties were experienced with the free-fall mooring\nsystems which were designed to permit the ships to anchor at their\nstations in 15,000 feet of water. The RAINIER mooring system failed\non May 1, the MT. MITCHELL on May 3, the ROCKAWAY on May 25, and the\nDISCOVERER and OCEANOGRAPHER on June 21, 1969, but the ships were\nable to operate satisfactorily in a station-keeping mode.\nWind finding at-sea systems (Scanwell) were installed on the\nOCEANOGRAPHER, RAINIER, and MT. MITCHELL. These provided the capability for taking winds aloft observations and upper-air soundings\nfrom a moving ship. A special purpose meteorological radar (Selenia)\nwas installed on the DISCOVERER for upper-air wind observations, and\ndocumentation of precipitation areas and rates.\nA 30-foot boom was fixed to the bow of each of the five ships to\nmeasure near-surface environmental conditions. On the boom, an array\nof meteorological instruments sensed dry bulb, wet bulb, and sea\nsurface temperatures, relative humidity, wind speed and direction,\nand net, incident, and reflected radiation.\nTethered, blimp-like balloons -- 26 feet long and 10 feet in\ndiameter -- flown from four of the five station vessels, carried instruments that measured temperature, humidity, and wind at one or more\nlevels within the lowest 2,000 feet of the atmosphere close to the sea\nsurface. These systems were called BLIP (Boundary Layer Instrument\nPackage). The fifth vessel, the ROCKAWAY, flew a similar system\ncalled Subcloud Instrumentation Telemetry System (SITS), developed\nby Florida State University.\nIn addition to the vessels at the corners and the center of the\narray, other ships participated in the project at various times. They\nwere the Coast Guard Cutters LAUREL and COURAGEOUS, the U.S Navy Ship\nGILLISS, the Cape Fear Technical Institute\'s ADVANCE II, and the\nBureau of Commercial Fisheries Research Ship UNDAUNTED. \t\nA floating laboratory instrument platform (FLIP) was an unpowered\n355-foot platform resembling part of a ship at the end of a 300-foot\ntube. When the tube was filled with water, the entire assezbly was\nupended to furnish a stable platform. A network of instrumented booms\nextended outward, upward, and downward from the small portion above\nwater.\nTwelve buoys in the BOMEX array measured ocean currents and temperatures at different depths, sea-surface temperatures, and meteoro-\n\nlogical conditions close to the surface.\n\n-3-\n\nI\n\nInformation at levels up to 60,000 feet was gathered by a fleet\nof aircraft that included the four planes from ESSA\'s Research Flight\nFacility, weather reconnaissance and research aircraft from the Air\nWeather Service and the U.S. Navy, and other planes from the National\nCenter for Atmospheric Research, the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Colorado State\nUniversity, and the University of California.\nThe first three BOMEX data-gethering peric,1s: May 3-15, May 24June 10, and June 19-July 2 were concerned with the interactions between ocean and atmosphere.\nTwo independent methods were used in the design of the experiment.\nOne, the point method, measured the upward and downward flow of energy\nin both sea and air at specific points on the sea surface. The second,\nor volume method, treated the BOMEX area as a cube. Instrumented aircraft flying around the large cube of air and ships at the corners\nwith both free and tethered balloons measured the inward and outward\nflow of air with its content of heat and moisture. Salinity, temperature, and depth were measured by instruments "STD\'s" lowered into the\nocean at the ship stations.\nIn concentrated observation periods of approximately 4 days each,\nconditions in the BOMEX area were measured by the instrumented balloons,by instruments dropped from aircraft, by the ships at the corners of the array, and by day and night "line integral" flights around\nthe cube\'s outer perimeter. During these intensive data-gathering\nperiods, serial rawinsonde observations"were made 15 times a day, dropsonde observations were taken at eight points within the array both\nday and night, and shipboard observations were scheduled to coincide\nwith the rawinsonde observations.\nThese measurements will be used to calculate the net gains or losses\nin heat, moisture, and wind energy in the volume of air overlying the\nBOMEX square, and the amount of heat and moisture that the atmosphere\nover the area receives from the sea. The five ships in the BOMEX array\nalso measured water vapor transport independently.\nAfter logging at BOMEX Field Headquarters, the data tapes, associated\ndata sheets, on-board recorded strip charts, and films were flown to\nNASA\'s ?Mississippi Test Facility for data processing and reduction.\nThe fourth period (July 11-28) was devoted to the exploration of\nconvective systems. It is in these systems that most of the energy\nin the atmospheric boundary layer is transported to higher levels and\ndistributed throughout the troposphere. During this period, a group of\n11 aircraft was dispatched to take observations in areas of extensive\nconvective activity. The choice of the areas was determined from cloud\nphotographs from ESSA Satellites and the NASA ATS-III synchronous satellite.\n\xe2\x80\x944-\n\nTo increase the chances of intercepting tropical disturbances,\nthe ship array was changed on July 11 to the configuration shown\nin figure 1. In this way, the latitudinal spread was extended to\nincorporate the Intertropical Convergence Zone.\nThe structure of the normal ITC (Intertropical Convergence\nZone) is of great importance to the general circulation. The operations during Phase IV are considered to be Lhe best exploration\nof the ITC ever conducted. The structure and the way the structure\nand nature of disturbances related to it were investigated. Some\n46 independent research projects were conducted during this tropical\nconvection study.\nB. Data and Preliminary Findings\nThe volume of data to be analyzed is prodigious. Instrumented\naircraft of the participating agencies flew more than a million miles\non 509 research missions, continuously recording observations of a\nvariety of weather elements for more than 4,000 hours. Some 500 dropsondes were released from the participating aircraft during BOMEX\noperations.\nThe five ships in the BOMEX array carried out 1316 soundings of\nocean temperature and salinity. These ships and an island station\noperated by the Air Force\'s Air Weather Service launched and tracked\n2400 upper-air sounding balloons to gather information on temperature,\nhumidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, and radiation to\naltitudes as high as 100,000 feet.\nA total of some 500 separate SCARD tapes were collected, covering\n7680 hours of meteorological and oceanographic data.\nA preliminary data summary of teletype messages from the five\nBOMEX array ships shows the following:\t\n7110 hours of Boom operation;\n1400 STD observations:\n710 hours of boundary layer observations;\n1060 hours of Atmospheric sampling -- AEC;\n4405 hours of ship navigation.\nPreliminary examination of the BOMEX data indicates that some\nconcepts concerning the physical processes at work near the sea-air\ninterface may have to be revised. Examples are:\n1) Oceanographers found strong eastward-moving currents in\nthe Atlantic off Barbados, where ocean atlases show predominately\nwestward-flow.\n-5-\n\nt\n\n,\n\n--+-- BOMEX FIXED SHIP ARRAY DURING 4th .PERIOD 18\n\n.,\n\noN\n\nROCKAWAY\nB RBADDS\n\n,\xe2\x80\xa2\n58 W\n\n54 W\n\n,\n\n\\\n\nFIG . 1\n\n-6-\n\n,\'i\n\n2) Ocean measurements disclosed a large water mess, probably from the Amazon River, that remains unmixed with ocean water\nas far as 1,000 miles from the mouth of the. river.\n3) FLIP data indicated the presence of small atmospheric\n\'fronts\', with sudden temperature and humidity increases or decreases, the humidit y displacementu continuing; for several minutes, while the temperature returns quickly to its previous\nvalue.\t\nThe existence of patches of moist and dry air a mile\nor so in diameter with little change in temperature was known\nto occur in the cloud-bearing layer, but the existence immediately\nadjacent to the sea surface and the sharpness of the boundaries\nwere surprising.\n4) Measurements of radiation taken at several levels revealed that perhaps twice as much incoming solar radiation is\nabsorbed in the tropical atmosr)here as had been believedi (though\nstill only a small fraction). \'thus, the amount of solar radiation available to heat the oceans is slightly less than previotisly\nestimated.\n5) Preliminary analysis of the fourth period data indicates\nthat the ITC is easily deformed by weather disturbances farther\nnorth. This deformation apparently creates cloud circulations\nwhich are characteristic of tropical storms. The arrival of an\ninverted "V cloud system created a bulge in the ITC and consistently brought disturbances to the BOMEX area.\nC. Additional Research Projects\nNearly 100 independent research projects are included in BOMEX.\nThese can be divided into five major areas: oceanographic, radiation,\nand satellite studies in addition to the sea-air interaction program\nand the exploration of tropical convective systems.

Obj i cgives\nAn office, the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological. Analysis\nProject, has been established within the ESSA Research Laboratories.\nBOMAP coordinates the reduction and scientific evaluation of\nobservations made during the BOMEX field season, May 3 through\nJuly 28. 1969, and the production of results in meaningful, form; for\nexample, scientific and technical publications, so as to be of use to\nthe environmental science community in. both immediate service operational application, and in the planning for further field research\nprojects: especially those related to the Global Atmospheric Research\nProgram (CARP).\nESSA maintains its role as lead agency for the work (as was accomplished in the BOMEX Project) by establishing requirements and by\ncoordinating, planning, and directing certain scientific data analyses\nand evaluations, including the application and use of resources p-oled\nby the several cooperating; agencies. In particular, reduction and\nanalysis of data collected under the direction of the BOMEX Project\nOffice in support of the Sea-Air Interaction Program will be directed\nby BOMAP. BOMAP will direct the reduction, but not the analysis, of\ndata collected under direction of the BOMEX Project Office in the fourth\nphase of BOMEX in support of the Tropical Exploration Program. BOMAP\nwill assist in coordinating but will not actively direct the reduction\nand analysis of data collected under the direction of other BOMEX participants. A more detailed outline of the BOMAP task areas is shown\nin figure 2.\nB.\n\nOrganization\n\nScientists, technical specialists and experts are detailed from\nESSA\'s various components to work on phases of the project within a\nvarying time frame established by the Director to accomplish milestones\nleading to the total objective of BOMAP.\nHeadquarters staff will consist of the Director, Deputy Director,\ntechnical, administrative and clerical assistants. The Project is\norganized as follows, according to location:\n1) BOMAP Rockville Scientific Staff: developing data reduction\nand scientific computation requirements and synthesizing, evaluating,\nand interpreting the results of such computations.\n2) BOMAP-MTF Field Office at NASA\'s Mississippi Test Facility,\nBay St. Louis, Mississippi, with technical support at National\nWeather Records Center, Asheville, N.C., concerned with data reduction, scientific computation ,;and archiving.\n\n-12-\n\n\t\n\n#r\n\ny\nV\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 N\t\nY^\t\nR\n^` W\t\n^\'\t\n\n^ q\t\nt^ ^\t\nu ^f\t\n\nW\t\n\nY\n^,^q\nu.

It will not be possible even in\nthese problem areas to exhaust the scientific potential of the\nBOMEX data. It is planned that space and facilities can be made\navailable in the BOMAP quarters for a limited number of participants and visiting scientists from other organizations. Specific\nareas in which BOMAP staff coverage is particularly thin are\noceanography, boundary layer modeling and turbulence analysis.\nC. DataManagement and Availabili_^Z\nAll data collected under the operational direction of the\nBOMEX Barbados Field Headquarters is physically located at either\nthe NASA Mississippi Test Facility or the ESSA Research Flight Facility, or in the possession of individual experimenters who participated in BOMEX. Desired data, or \'information about the types\nand amounts of data at each location, can be obtained by submitting\na written request to BOMAP at the following address:\nBOMAP (W)\n\nEnvironmental Science Services Administration\n6010 Executive Boulevard WSC5\nRockville, Maryland 20852\nATTN: T.C. de la Moriniere\nTurnaround time on such requests is expected to be about two to\nthree weeks initially because latest processing schedules must be\nreviewed, reproduction must be accomplished, and negotiation for\nalternate data than that requested must be considered. All data\nrequests should be explicit as to observation(s) required, exact\ndates and times for which data are required, and address and telephone number of the requester.\nIn addition to these measures to disseminate and provide information about BOMEX data to BOMEX participants and the scientific\ncommunity, BOMAP is developing a comprehensive Data Management System to:\nProvide a central information exchange point for all BOMEX\ninvestigators during the data analysis period;\nPublish and document the experimental methods and scientific\nresults of BOMEX (see section F below);\nArchive all BOMEX data to insure minimum degradation of information content, prompt retrieval, and adequate dissemination\nto the scientific community; and\nCollect and collate information from all BOMEX participants\nrelative to progress in reduction and analysis of BOMEX data.\n\n-16.\n\n4P\n\nMuch of the preliminary design of such a data management system\nhas been done (refer to Annex H of the BOMEX Operation Plan, January\n1969). The framework establishAd by the plan, which was adequate to\nsupport field operations, is being revised to reflect recent changes\nin the scope of the BOMAP data analysis objectives.\nThe BOMEX Data Catalog, which consists of one edition and two\nsupplements, is being prepared for printing and distribution. The\nedition will contain a detailed inventory of observed data and an\nexplanation of the mechanics for requesting and disseminating data\nthat become available. This first edition is scheduled for distribution in early February 1970.\nThe first supplement will include an inventory of processed da,\'a\nproducts, supporting documentation, describing data processing, ana\nthe location of archived results which exist 1 year after the conclusion of the BOMEX Observation Phases. As implied above, this supplement amplifies the data inventory to reflect the availability of processed and validated data products, and support documentation 1 year\nafter the BOMEX field data acquisition phase. This supplement is\nscheduled for distribution in September 1970. As validated data become available prior to that date, the cooperating investigators and\nthe scientific community will be advised through the BOMEX Bulletin\nSeries.\nThe second and final supplement will be a definitive and complete\ninventory of all observed data, processed data products, support documentation (processing techniques, instrument description, instrument\noperation histories, etc.), and archive locations at the conclusion of\nthe planned BOMAP analysis activity.\nBecause of the nature and magnitude of the BOMEX data reduction\nproblem, it is expected that a significant fraction of the reduced data\nwill not be available for dissemination before early 1970. It is hoped\nthat the data collected under BOMEX Field Headquarters direction will\nthen become available in reduced form over a 6-month period.\nIn view of the Barge number of requests at BOMAP for basic meteorological and oceanographic data obtained during BOMEX, several volumes\nof unvalidated teletype data entitled "BOMEX Preliminary Data" are being\npublished for limited distribution on request. It is hoped that these\nvolumes will satisfy the immediate needs for planning and outlining\nfuture research studies. These volumes include:\nVolume I: Ship-Station Surface Observations.\nVolume II: Ship-Station Radiosonde Observations (Parts 1 & 2).\n\n-17-\n\nVolume III: Salinity - Temperature - Depth Observations\n(Parts 1 & 2) .\nVolume IV: Sea-Surface Temperature Observations.\nData in these volumes must be used with caution because of the\nfollowing limitations:\n1)\n\nThe data must be considered unedited and unvalidated:\n\n2) The data are assembled in chronalolical order only; no\nattempt was made to group the data according to ships;\n3) Some data may be missing because of communication problems\nencountere a in scheduled teletype messages (see BOMBX Operations\nManual and BOMEX Bulletin No. 3 for schedules); and\n4) Some data may be illegible because the data volumes are\nconstructed from photographs of data on teletype paper.\nD. Ship-Surface\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe data referred to here are those recorded automatically on\nmagnetic tape by the SCARD (Signal Conditioning and Recording Device)\nsystem, The SCARD system was designed and built by the General Electric\nCompany as contractor to NASA\'s Mississippi Test Facility. Digitizing\nis being done primarily by NASA\'s Computer Operations Office at Slidell,\nLa. Data reduction and much of the scientific computation will be done\nby the Mississippi Test Facility. The data recorded on SCARD include:\nTime (from time-code generator)\nRadiosonde temperature and humidity;\nRawiosonde slant-range and azimuth on the three ships with\n\t\nScanwell wind-finding systems;\nSTD (oceanographic sounding) salinity, temperature, and depth;\nBoom dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, sea-surface\ntemperature, wind direction, wind speed, incident solar radiation, reflected solar radiation, and net long-wave radiation;\nShip gyrocompass heading; and\nSurface barometric pressure.\n\n-18-\n\nE\n\n4\n\nThe data were recorded by SCARD as frequency modulated analog\nsignals and are being converted to digital form prior to further\nprocessing. One ship, the DISCOVERER, recorded rawinsonde position\ninformation on punched paper tape, which was copied onto magnetic\ntape for data reduction. The ROCKAVAY recorded rawinsonde position\ninformation manually. ROCKAWAY rawinsonde position information and\nmanually recorded supporting information from all ships are made\navailable to the data-reduction program by means of punched cards or\nmagnetic tape.\nThe use of computers in data-reduction is no longer a mystery,\nand its routine aspects will be omitted here. The factors peculiar\nto the EOINEX data reduction are.:\nConverting analogue data to digitized data.\nSpecial measures taken to increase accuracy of the radiosonde\ndata.\nDirect reduction from raw data rather than from manuallyselected data;\nProblems introduced by automatic recording- and\nProblems of accuracy resulting from the nature of analyses to\nbe made from the data.\nDigitizing is Mentioned here merely to note that considerable\neffort is necessary to ensure that the digital numbers accurately\ndescribe the analog signals recorded from the sensors.\nSeveral measures were taken to increase the accuracy of radiosonde\ndata. The special calibrations made by the manufacturer were most\nimportant. Thermistors were calibrated individually and required to\nconform to a common calibration curve within 0.1 0 C maximum error. The\ncarbon hygristors were lot calibrated and required to conform to a\ncommon calibration curve within 2 percent relative humidity maximum\nerror. In addition, the resistance of each thermistor was measured\nat 30\xc2\xb0C, eliminating one baseline computation. Finally, a special precision resistor, called the mid-reference resistor, was used in the\nnormal high-reference position to allow the internal resistance of each\nsonde to be calculated. To complement the hygristor calibration,\nbaseline readings were taken with precision thermometers graduated and\ncalibrated to 0.1\xc2\xb0C. The use of these special measures together with\nmagnetic-tape recording and readout is expected to give system accuracy\nof about 0.25 0 C and 3 percent relative humidity.\n\n-19-\n\nAutomated reduction of raw data, rather than manually-selected\ndata, introduced the problems of data identification, noise rejection,\nsignificant point selection, determination of start and stop times,\nand selection of proper constants for transfer equations. Some of\nthese problems are solved in the following ways:\nl) The data identification problem was solved for the\nradiosonde as a by-product of the need to increase the density of humidity readings for BOMEX. Temperature and humidity\nsensors were placed on separate sondes, received by separate\nreceivers, and thus the temperature and humidity data could be\nfed to the computer in separate channels.\n2) Each STD sensor had its own frequency channel and presented no identification problems.\n3) boom and other surface data were commutated onto one\nchannel and to date no problems have arisen from identifying\ndata by commutation sequence.\n4) A data identification problem\nmeters are flown on the sondes. Thes,\noff the strip charts manually and are\nautomated program. There appear to be\ncles to strictly automated processing\nmanpower and time for programming and\nnot been available.\n\ndoes arise when radiodata are being picked\ntreated as noise by the\nno insurmountable obstaof these data but the\nprogram checkout have\n\n5) The most important factor in noise rejection is the\nuse of a high sampling rate. This allows gross noise to be\nrejected immediately without contaminating adjacent samples.\nNoise close to expected sensor-output frequency or voltage\ncan be handled by several methods, depending on circumstances\nor signal characteristics. The most obvious choice is to\n\t\naverage or smooth several successive values together. Another\nchoice requires new data to be within prescribed limits of\nprevious data from the same sensor. Or, individual values\nwithin small groups can be required to be within prescribed\nlimits\t\nthe group mean. In tests conducted to date, more\nelaborate schemes do not appear to be necessary or justified.\na) The basic digitizing rate for bOMEX data is ten samples per second. Values outside allowable ranges are discarded at this point and the remaining values combined by averaging into two-per-second samples, the averaging method depending on the type of data being treated. The two-sample-persecond data are fed to the data reduction program for further\nnoise-elimination treatment and for reduction to meteorological\nunits from the frequency or voltage values received from the\ndigitizing process.\n\n-20-\n\nI\n\nb) After noise elimination, the basic data for the datareduction process are 5-second averages for all rawinsonde\ndata and for STD depth, l-second averages for STI) temperature\nand salinity, and averages over the parameter sampling time\n(3/4-second) for boom and surface readings. The basic rate\nfor BLIP (Boundary Layer Instrumented Package) is still, to be\ndetermined.\nC) Some further smoothing; of 5-second averages of radiosonde temperatures, and possibly humidity, will be nece.s-\xc2\xb0iry.\nA study is being made to determine the best smooth6r to use in\nrelation to resolution desired and noise to be eliminated.\n6) A dual approach is planned in regards to selecting significant points from soundings and of avere.ging periods for archiving\nof boom/surface data.\na) First, reduced data from all sensors will be saved at\nthe basic rates ,given in subparagraph 5b above, and these will\nbe available to BOMEX experimenters on request.\n\nG\t\n\nb) To meet permanent archiving requirements, 30-minute\naverages will be saved for boom and surface data. Significant\npoint data will be saved for rawinsonde temperature and humiditysignificance criteria will be 0.25 0C or 3 percent relative\nhumidity departure from a straight line instead of the usual\n10C and 5 percent relative humidity. Rawinsonde winds will be\narchived as determined frc.m 60-second average positions at\n30-second intervals (i.e. two overlapping series of 60-second\nwinds) .\nc) The final archiving sample rates for STD soundings and\nBLIP data have not been determined.\n7) The problem of start and stop times is probably the most\ntroublesome of all. No completely satisfactory method has been\nfound for determining from recorded data exactly when a sounding\nstarted and stopped or when boom/surface sensors were operating properly. Several operating procedures and SCARD-recorded indicators\nwere planned and more-or-less used, but all were victims of human\nfailings, misguided ingenuity, and communication problems. The\nproblem is further complicated by the apparent requirement for two\nstart times for rawinsonde soundings: one for release time for\nwind determination, and one for actual start-o\xc2\xa3-rise time for\nother sounding computations. (The two times are not normally the\nsame for shipboard releases.; The solution adopted is for start add\nstop times and sensor-inoperative times to be determined manually,\nusing all available information, and to be fed into the program by\nmeans of punched cards or magnetic tape.\n\n-23.-\n\n8) Many times during BOMEX it was found necessary to change\nsensors or to adjust output ranges of sensors. This requires that\nthe data-reduction program select either the proper constant or\nthe full transfer equation, depending on sensor serial number or\non date and time of observation. ( This short statement ignores\nthe several man-months of work required to determine and crosscheck transfer constants from calibration data and manufacturers\'\ninformation.)\nData-reduction problems caused by automated recording are limited\nto those caused by rotary potentiometers. These devices were used to\nsense ship\'s heading from the gyrocompass and slant range and azimuth\nfrom the Scanwell rawinsonde equipment.\n1) A loading correction is necessary for slant range and ship\'s\nheading. This is due to the current drain necessary to feed SCARD\nand calls for a maximum ,correction of about 0.035 volts. This is\non the fringe of the noise level but is systematic.\n2) Rotary potentiometers, of necessity, have a dead space\nbetween the terminals. This appears to have ranged from two to\nthree degrees from one potentiometer to\xe2\x80\x9e another, It is: also suspected of changing from one revolution to the next on a g^Lven\npotentiometer, probably due to contact chatter or to accumulation\nof dirt or corrosion. The net effect will be a small uncertainty\nin ship\'s heading near true north and a small jump in slant range\nat 2000-meter intervals. Except for noting its presence, this\nproblem will be ignored unless it is found to be significant.\n3) The two problems mentioned above were avoided for Scanwell\nazimuth by providing a fine-azimuth potentiometer geared up 15:1\nfrom the 360 1 -azimuth potentiometer. This reduces errors in the\nfine-azimuth to an acceptable size but it introduces another. This\nerror arises from the practical impossibility of keeping the two\npotentiometers zeroed in precise synchronism. The problem was\nsolved by using the fine-azimuth as reference in aligning the\nequipment and by requiring the data reduction program to allow\nfor a small variable bias ( or nonlinearity) in the 360 1 potentiometer.\n4) Another problem with the rotary potentiometer, particularly\nfor slant range, is the tendency of the signal to oscillate from\nmaximum to minimum value several times before definitely changing.\nThe simplest way to handle this is to treat such short-time oscillations as noise and to interpolate acress the break after a change\nhas definitely been made.\n\n-22-\n\nProblems of accuracy arise both from the better-than-normal\nacc\xc2\xbbracy available from some BOMBX sensors and from taking into\naccount small errors that are normally overlooked.\n1) The O.l oC accuracy of radiosonde thermisrors means\nthat it becomes practical., to correct for the 4- to 6-second\nlag coefficient of the standard Weather Bureau thermistor\nused for BOMEX. This gives a systematic correction of 0.1\nto 0.2 0 C, making mean temperatures for layers slightly cooler\nand improving resolution somewhat for significant point location.\n2) Using 5-second data as basic input for radiosonde computations makes it apparent that the baroswitch setting is generally disturbed during launch. Neglect of this error leads to\ncomputation of impossible balloon movements during the first\nminute or two of flight. A correction will be computed based\non the difference between actual launch pressure and a launch\npressure extrapolated from the first two pressure contacts after\nlaunch.\nScanwell rawinsonde slant-range values recorded on SCARED\nmay begin with an initial reading of anything up to 2000 meters.\nThe initial reading must be subtracted from subsequent readings\nto obtain the correct slant range. However, the signal is typically very erratic for the first few 5-second periods (probably\nbecause of interference from ships superstructure), requiring\nthat the initial value be obtained by extrapolating backward\nafter the signal has stabilized.\n3)\n\ny\t\n\n4) It has also been found that near the end of a rawinsonde\nflight, the direct shipboard output of slant range from the Scanwell recorder may differ by several hundred meters from that determined from data recorded on SCARD. This is due to the difference\nin time bases. The Scanwell recorder gets its time from 60 hz\n(cycles/second) ships power. SCARD obtained time from a time-code\ngenerator. There is no doubt that the time-code generator is a\nmore accurate time keeper than the ship\'s frequency regulator, but\nthe effect of the difference is to be evaluated.\n5) Considerable doubt has arisen as to the proper source, or\ncombination of sources, to use for surface temperature and humidity.\nThe several sources available have only general agreement. Individual temperature readings from different sources typically differ by\nabout a degree, but have been noted to be up to three degrees different. Pending further study, the problem has been resolved by obtaining radiosonde surface values by extrapolation downward from the\n15- and 30-second readings.\n\n-23-\n\n6) Finally, there is the problem of accurate determination\nof ship\'s position. Even the Omega navigation system allows\nerrors of up to 2 tables in the BOMEX area. The Coast and Geodetic\nSurvey has agreed to restudy all navigation records and provide\ncorrected position and velocity information. Corrections will\nthen be applied to all computed winds.\nE. Aircraft Data Reduction\nOne of the principal objectives of the sea-air interaction program\nwas the collection of data to evaluate the budgets of mass, water vapor,\nmomentum, and energy for the BOMEX volume. Several aircraft were flown\nin support of this objective. The U.S. Air Force WC-13C made dropsondes\nat several points along the diagonals of the array. The U.S. Navy WC-121\nand the Research Flight acility (RFF) DC-6\'s and DC-4 gathered data on\nthe perimeter of the array as well as on stepwise ascent soundings.\nThe diverse nature of the data-gathering systems requires different\nprocessing procedures. The data from the three RFF aircraft were\ngathered automatically on magnetic tape at the rate of one observation\nper second.\nAll of the Navy and Air Force data were hand tabulated. These cd;:ta\ntaust be transferred to forms suitable for card punching, and then transferred to magnetic tape. Two to three months are required for this\noperation which will be done at the BOMAP Office in Rockville. This\nwill be followed by evaluation of the errors in the wind-measuring sensors, and intercomparisons with other aircraft data and with shipboard\ndata.\nA quick partial reduction of the fourth period data will be done\nby Mr. Luis Cantilo of the Universit: 7 of Miami. A more complete processing of the RFF data will be done by RFF and NHRL using a modification of procedures normally executed in processing hurricane research\nflights. A set of basic, calibrated data is expected to become availaisle in 4 to 6 months, and all BOMAX RFF flights are expected to be\ncompleted, in 6 to 9 months.\nF. Information Exchange and Publication\nBOMEX investigators, including the BOMAP scientific staff, will require information from other BOMEX participants -- particularly the\nresults of investigations that will aid in the interpretation of their\nown data. The BOMAP Office will attempt to maintain a directory of all\nresearch projects using BOMEX data and will serve as a clearing house\nfor BOMEX data and scientific results. It is urgently requested that\ncopies of all reports resulting from BOMEX, whether preliminary or final;\nbe sent to the BOMAP Office. The availability of all BOMEX information\nwill aid the BOMAP Staff in making appropriate referrals, in responding\nto inquiries, and in expediting communications among investigators.\n\n-24-\n\n4\n\nBOMAP will utilize the following media for publication of\nscientific information"\n1) BOMEX Bulletin series \t\ncontinued on a quarterly basis\nfor rapid dissemination of information on status and progress of\nBOMEX data reduction. and analysis, and for administrative information.\n2) ESSA Technical Memoranda \xe2\x80\xa2-- for prompt documentation and\nlimited distribution of preliminary technical results.\n3) ESSA Technical Reports -- for prompt publication of technical results expected to have z useful lifetime up to a Few years,\nprimarily as a means to further the development of final results and\nto permit BOMEX findings and techniques to be fully considered in\nthe development of plans for future experiments.\n4) Scientific journals -- for results of sufficient finality\nand importance to justif -7 the delays in p reparation, review and\nediting, encounterec! in this tvne of publication.\n5) A permanent BOMEX scientific publication series -\xe2\x80\xa2- for\nmore complete and detailed accounts of experimental and analytical\nmethods. calibrations, and data tabulations than would normally be\nappropriate for journal publication.\nThe cooperation of all BOMEX investigators is needed to provide a\nclef initi.ve permanent record of BOWEX and to mace the findings of BO"\'TEX\nreadily available to the entire scientific community.\nIt is expected that BO\'MEY investigators aFfiliated with other\norganizations and agencies wi. Ll use their own nor:-al channels for\nreporting results of the type mentioned in iteris (.\'_) , (1) , and (4) .\nPlans and procedures for item 5 will be developed with the benefit\nof suggestions from the BOMEX community and will, be announced. in\nfuture BOM X Bulletins.\n\n-25-\n\nRecent arcicles describing BOMEX activities include:\n1.\n\n2.\n\n"Where the Air Meets the Sea," ESSA World, U.S. Department\nof Commerce, Environmental Science Services Administration,\nJuly 1969.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n"The BOMEX Protect," Joachim P.
