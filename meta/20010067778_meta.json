This methodology permitted a quantitative comparison of decadal changes in global ocean chlorophyll from the CZCS (1979-1986) and SeaWiFS (Sep. 1997-Dec. 2000) records. Global seasonal means of ocean chlorophyll decreased over the two observational segments, by 8% in winter to 16% in autumn. Chlorophyll in the high latitudes was responsible for most of the decadal change. Conversely, chlorophyll concentrations in the low latitudes increased. The differences and similarities of the two data records provide evidence of how the Earth's climate may be changing and how ocean biota respond. Furthermore, the results have implications for the ocean carbon cycle.", "title": "Decadal Changes in Global Ocean Chlorophyll", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010067778, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gregg, Watson W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "42e24d6bbb324d759d27838afd866efa"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20010067778, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Conkright, Margarita E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "1c98e97745994d4ab789f00ae3544cc5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20010067778, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Koblinsky, Chester J."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "40ff5c0fedb749d9b9199dfeac61c90c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010067778, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010067778, "id": "266cae15bb584b7aa0937bd43eb0987b", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010067778.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010067778/downloads/20010067778.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010067778/downloads/20010067778.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010067778/downloads/20010067778.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
