The main objective is to determine the effects of various noise sources on the capability of a CCD photometer to maintain a system relative precision of 1 x $10^(-5)$ for mv = 12 stars in the presence of system-induced noise sources. The facility includes a simulated star field, fast optics to simulate the telescope, a thinned back-illuminated CCD similar to those to be used on the spacecraft and computers to perform the onboard control, data processing and extraction. The test structure is thermally and mechanically isolated so that each source of noise can be introduced in a controlled fashion and evaluated for its contribution to the total noise budget. The effects of pointing errors or a changing thermal environment are imposed by piezo-electric devices. Transits are injected by heating small wires crossing apertures in the star plate. Signals as small as those from terrestrial-size transits of solar-like stars are introduced to demonstrate that such planets can be detected under realistic noise conditions. Examples of imposing several noise sources and the resulting detectabilities are presented. These show that a differential ensemble photometric approach CCD photometer can readily detect signals associated with Earth-size transits.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United Kingdom", "submissionId": 20010084632, "endDate": "2000-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Astronomical Union Meeting", "location": "Manchester", "id": "bcf7c8d37d9145bbbfc0bcbd5f612b3b", "startDate": "2000-08-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010084632, "id": "0107bd9e2d5c4dbab5aa5353a0421647", "publicationDate": "2000-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
