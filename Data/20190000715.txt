Private package delivery companies and government agencies have an\ninterest in vehicles that have large payload to\nweight ratios; thus allowing to deliver heavy payloads. Currently, UAS con\xef\xac\x81gurations suffer from\npropulsive and aerodynamic limitations that decrease the payload weight and/or mission range.\nIn order to decrease these limitations, the Kinetic\nand Potential Energy Alternation for Greater Lift\nEnhancement (KP EAGLE) concept provides a\nnovel way to transport payloads that may be too\nheavy for vehicles in a similar weight class. The\nconcept vehicle takes off vertically without the\npayload. It then performs a dive maneuver that\ntransfers the gained potential energy into kinetic\nenergy to pick up the payload. This concept does\nnot require special equipment during takeoff or\nlanding and provides a better payload to weight\nratio than other conventional vehicles in the same\nweight class.\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the emerging market of Urban Air Mobility (UAM)[1], package delivery through the air\nhas become appealing for easier and quicker access. However, there are limitations in the package weight and distances that can be covered by\ncurrent Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). Most\nUAS vehicles fall into two categories: \xef\xac\x81xed-wing\n\nairplanes that takeoff and land horizontally or\nwith assistance, and vertical takeoff and landing\n(VTOL) vehicles.\nFixed-wing vehicles use wings as the main\ncomponent to generate lift. Ultimately, the aerodynamic and propulsive components have a large\neffect on the payload capabilities. Fixed-wing vehicles tend to have larger payload to weight ratios\nthan other con\xef\xac\x81gurations. The main disadvantage of this type of vehicle is the large takeoff\ndistances required. This is often addressed by using special takeoff equipment such as catapults.\nInside the category of VTOL vehicles, there\nare multirotors and vehicles that transition from\nVTOL to horizontal \xef\xac\x81xed-wing \xef\xac\x82ight (forward\n\xef\xac\x82ight). The design of multirotor con\xef\xac\x81gurations,\ndue to the lack of wings, focuses on propellers\nand motor selection in order to generate lift; thus,\nthe payload capabilities are determined by the\namount of thrust that can be generated by the motors. Finally, a VTOL vehicle that can transition\nto forward \xef\xac\x82ight has the potential of having better\nrange due to the aerodynamic bene\xef\xac\x81t of having\nwings. In order to increase payload capabilities,\nmultiple propulsors are often used.\nThis paper presents a novel vehicle con\xef\xac\x81guration inspired by nature that has payload to weight\nratios typical of \xef\xac\x81xed-wing vehicles but can takeoff and land vertically. This vehicle is called\nthe Kinetic and Potential Energy Alternation for\nGreater Lift Enhancement (KP EAGLE) con\xef\xac\x81guration. This unique concept allows the vehicle to\ntakeoff like a VTOL vehicle, transition to forward\n\xef\xac\x82ight, and use the vehicle momentum and aerodynamics to snatch a payload at high speeds and\n\n1\n\nSTEVEN GEUTHER, FRANCISCO CAPRISTAN, JASON KIRK, RACHEAL ERHARD\n\nangle of attack. The maneuver to pick up the payload enables heavier payloads that can currently\nonly be delivered by drones that require catapults.\n2\n\nBackground\n\n2.1\n\nMotivation\n\nFor companies like Google and Amazon or government agencies like the Department of Defense\n(DOD) and NASA there has been an interest in\nthe capability of heavy lift for a speci\xef\xac\x81ed range.\nIn order to do this, the traditional way is to add\nmore power to the aircraft, which in turn adds\nto the overall weight and often size of the vehicle. There is a unique gap in development of\nnon-complex vehicles that are capable of providing substantial lift with a reasonable range. A\nvehicle able to takeoff and land with minimum\nequipment and deliver heavy payloads while being able to cover large distances can increase the\ncapabilities of UAS delivery.\n2.2\n\nMarket\n\nPackage delivery companies such as Amazon are\nfocusing on using drones to deliver payloads that\nweigh 5 lbs or less. This is because approximately 86% of packages delivered by Amazon\nare in that weight range.1 This means that 14%\nof packages will not be able to be delivered by\na drone. Although the number of large payloads\n(greater than 5 lbs) represent a smaller percentage of deliveries, a drone with those capabilities\ncould more effectively cover the available package delivery market or increase the range of packages delivered at 5 lbs or less. In addition, in order to deliver to a large portion of the US population (greater than 50%) through Amazon, DHL,\nWalmart, and Target an approximate range of 180\nnautical miles is desired [2].\nAnother important market is humanitarian relief. A vehicle that requires simple takeoff and\n\nlanding equipment can be used to deliver payloads to and from rural areas since it does not\nneed special equipment such as a catapult or\npaved runways. Companies such as Zipline2 have\nproposed and implemented concepts that deliver\nmedical supplies to rural areas by using a \xef\xac\x81xed\nwing UAS. This type of concept is revolutionizing humanitarian relief by using ideas being developed in the package delivery arena.\nAnother potential market alternative is science missions proposed by NASA. Payloads can\nbe taken from one location to another with relative ease. This type of approach would bene\xef\xac\x81t\nscience missions where multiple samples from a\nvariety of locations are desired.\n2.3\n\nPrior Examples\n\nThere are different vehicles and ideas that explore the delivery of heavy payloads (large payload to weight ratios). Some of the vehicles that\nhave been explored for heavy lift aircraft including the Boeing LIFT vehicle [3], which is large\nin size and must have tethered power for a long\nendurance (greater than 18 minutes). The design\nshowcases a modular quadcopter to accomplish a\nhigher payload capability by increasing the size\nand power options. Another company, Flytrex,3\nutilizes a family of multicoptors that are rated\nat different capabilities in order to overcome the\nneeds of the consumer. Flytrex\xe2\x80\x99s largest vehicle maxes out on payload at 6.6 lbs with a range\nof 5.4 nautical miles. Although Flytrex has surpassed the payload capability, the range of the vehicle is low. Finally, Zipline has successfully implemented package delivery using an automated\ncatapult launched \xef\xac\x81xed wing vehicle capable of\n3.3 lbs of payload with a range of 80 nautical\nmiles. 4 Some of the potential improvements for\nthe Zipline concept include handling heavier payloads and eliminating the need for a base to assist\nin takeoff and landings.\n2 http://www.\xef\xac\x82yzipline.com\n3 http://www.\xef\xac\x82ytrex.com/\n\n1 https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-\n\ndrones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hourshipping\n\n4 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608034/blood-\n\nfrom-the-sky-ziplines-ambitious-medical-drone-deliveryin-africa\n\n2\n\nA VTOL Small Unmanned Aircraft System to Expand Payload Capabilities\n\nNature has also provided a plausible solution to delivering \xe2\x80\x98heavy\xe2\x80\x99 payloads. Birds of\nprey have weight carrying capabilities that exceed their body weight [4]. Table 1 shows the\nweight carrying capabilities for some selected\nbirds of prey. These birds of prey can carry more\nthan their own body weight. This is in part,\npossibly, because they can acquire the payload\nduring \xef\xac\x82ight, avoiding a power intensive takeoff.\nThus, an UAS that is able to replicate some of\nthis behavior could potentially provide payload\nto weight ratios similar to the ones obtained by\nbirds of prey.\n\nthat a vehicle that can mimic bird-like maneuvers\nto pick up payloads mid-\xef\xac\x82ight has the potential\nof having a high payload to weight fraction, a\nmedium range, and it would not need complex\nequipment for takeoff and landing. This is in\npart due to the fact that lift generated is a function of velocity, so the faster a vehicle \xef\xac\x82ies, the\ngreater lift force is generated. The bird-like vehicle would take the bene\xef\xac\x81cial aspects of each of\nthe other types of vehicles and combine them into\na single vehicle by utilizing the maneuver.\nTable 2 Vehicle comparison.\n\nTable 1 Weight carrying capabilities of selected\n\nbirds.\nApprox.

In particular, the GRASP\nLab at University of Pennsylvania has proposed\na concept that can grab a payload at slow speeds\n[5]. This vehicle is a quadcopter and is able to\ncapture the payload while \xef\xac\x82ying at 4.5 and 6.7\nmiles per hour. This speed is slow but provides a\npoint of reference of the current state of the art in\ngrabbing payloads mid-\xef\xac\x82ight.\nVehicles that can perform maneuvers at high\nspeeds to capture payload have the potential of\nproviding large payload to weight ratios as seen\nin Table 1. This type of vehicle differs from the\nconcept proposed by the GRASP Lab at University of Pennsylvania because of the large speeds\nat which the vehicle should be able to operate in\norder to use the lift provided by the wings to carry\nheavy payloads.\nA comparison of the capabilities of different\nvehicles is shown in Table 2. This table shows\n\nThe main requirement of the proposed vehicle is\nto ensure that it can be used practically anywhere\nwhile providing a payload to weight ratio that\nexceeds what other vehicles in the same weight\nclass can achieve. In order to operate nearly anywhere, the proposed vehicle must be able to takeoff and land with minimal assistance. A \xef\xac\x81xedwing VTOL con\xef\xac\x81guration would satisfy the criteria of operating nearly everywhere but would\nnot be able to deliver higher payload to weight\nratios than multicopters because VTOL vehicles\nrely solely on the propulsion system to generate\nlift during takeoff. In addition VTOL vehicles\nare typically complex in nature and the majority\nof the weight capability is consumed by actuation\n(tilt wing/rotor). To work around this limitation,\nthe payload will be picked up while the vehicle is\nalready in horizontal \xef\xac\x82ight similar to the behavior\nseen by birds of prey. All other bene\xef\xac\x81cial aspects\nof VTOL including the low ground ops complexity and higher range will be utilized. However,\nthere will be a slight degradation of range capability due to the mission pro\xef\xac\x81le of the vehicle uti3\n\nSTEVEN GEUTHER, FRANCISCO CAPRISTAN, JASON KIRK, RACHEAL ERHARD\n\nlizing a lot of power as well as the wing to generate lift and the need for two climbing maneuvers.\nFigure 1 shows the planned mission.\n\nFig. 1 KP EAGLE mission pro\xef\xac\x81le.\n\nIn the \xef\xac\x81rst iteration of the design cycle the focus is on establishing a proof of concept rather\nthan designing an optimized vehicle. Another\nspeci\xef\xac\x81c requirements for the mission is to be able\nto pick up the payload on the move without any\nadverse dynamic effects. For an initial assessment and prototype, 8 lbs will be used as maximum vehicle weight, while being able to carry an\nadditional 8 lbs of payload.\nThere are some secondary requirements that\nmust also be included. The vehicle must have a\nhigh angle of attack point in order to use a pick\nup and drop off maneuver to reduce the dynamic\nloads on the vehicle. In addition, the vehicle\nshould be able to maintain a high speed and withstand the loading on the vehicle while picking up\nthe payload.\n4\n\nAnalysis Methodology and Design Challenges\n\nThe KP EAGLE concept provides an alternate\nmeans to pick up payloads that may be too heavy\nfor the rating of the current vehicles. The goal is\nto maintain a small takeoff weight, while still being able to carry a relatively heavy payload. The\nhighest amount of energy required is during takeoff and landing, therefore taking off without the\npayload saves a large amount of energy that can\nbe used to extend the endurance or increase the\n\nmaximum payload rating for the vehicle. The\nconcept is modeled after an eagle and the large\nweight to payload capability that the animal has,\nwhich is approximately 1:1 (as seen in Table 1).\nThe project includes the design of an aircraft that\ncan take off at a very low power, climb to a certain altitude to gather potential energy, which will\ntransfer into kinetic energy to provide the extra\nenergy that is needed to pick up a heavy payload.\nThe vehicle will be able to locate the payload,\ninitiate a dive towards the package, grab the payload during \xef\xac\x82ight, gain altitude again, and have\nenough power and energy remaining to have a\nuseful endurance.\nThere are different mechanisms to capture\npayloads when the vehicle is already in the air.\nOne of these mechanisms consists of a gripper\ninstalled at the bottom of a UAV to hold the payload. A second mechanism consists of suspending the payload with cables [6]. A third possible\noption is based on work performed in the GRASP\nLab at University of Pennsylvania [5]. In this\ncon\xef\xac\x81guration a robotic arm is attached to a quadcopter and is able to mimic a bird\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. The\nmain observation of this con\xef\xac\x81guration is the low\nspeed at which the vehicle operates.\nOne of the main design challenges includes\nthe unwanted dynamic loads and possible swing\nloads after connection with the payload. This inherently comes from the Center of Gravity (CG)\nshift in the total aircraft system. Having the CG\nshift from the designated stable location to a different location potentially further back and below\nthe aircraft could adversely affect the stability of\npitch and yaw of the aircraft during its most critical moment. The aircraft should be designed accordingly to be robust against any shifts in CG.\nSnatching a payload at high speeds is equivalent to having a controlled collision. Depending\non the mechanism used, different approaches to\nmodel this collision can be used to provide information to size the vehicle. Ultimately, this\nshift in momentum provides stresses in the vehicle airframe and can greatly affect the aerodynamic forces, causing an unstable system.\nA key bird-like maneuver that can bene\xef\xac\x81t the\ndesign of the KP-EAGLE concept is perching.\n\n4\n\nA VTOL Small Unmanned Aircraft System to Expand Payload Capabilities\n\nThe perching maneuver will allow the vehicle to\nland and deliver the payload without the need of\nparachutes. The KP-EAGLE concept will need\nto optimize its trajectory to ensure that such maneuver will provide the desired behavior [7].\nIn order to achieve the maneuvers that are required to capture and carry a payload that is equal\nto the vehicle weight, the vehicle needs to have\nspecial considerations during the design. The\nvehicle \xef\xac\x81rst and foremost must be able to handle the loads that it will see upon impact. The\nstructural limits at certain places along the wing\nand/or fuselage will need to be extra rigid, which\nwill also add weight to the vehicle. Material considerations should be taken into account during\nthe prototyping phase. The next aspect to tackle\nis the vehicle being able to achieve high angles of\nattack without stall or minimal stall effects. Finally, to reduce the take-off and landing requirements, the preferred vehicle should have VTOL\ncapabilities. VTOL vehicles that can transition to\nforward wing-borne \xef\xac\x82ight have challenges with\ncomplexity, stability and safety depending on the\nchosen con\xef\xac\x81guration. With all of the design challenges, the vehicle should use simplicity in order\nto keep the weight down allowing for a higher\npayload capability.\n5\n5.1\n\nVehicle Design and Analysis\nVehicle Geometry and Performance\n\nThe idea of simplicity for a VTOL vehicle leads\nto a design with minimal moving parts and robust\ntake off and landing considerations. A vehicle\nthat can takeoff and land on any surface brings\nmany bene\xef\xac\x81ts to the mission operations. In order to accomplish this, as well as being able to\nmaintain fast forward \xef\xac\x82ight, the vehicle will need\neither separate lift-thrust or a tilting mechanism\n. The chosen method of operations for a prototype will include vectored thrust with single axis\ngimbaling motors. The motors will have enough\navailable movement to lay on it\xe2\x80\x99s belly or at an\nangle provided by the grasping mechanism and\ntake off. Figure 2 shows the preliminary prototype design of the KP EAGLE. The vehicle is a\n\nbi-rotor \xef\xac\x82ying wing with additional slanted tails\nattached to the wing for natural stability. The vehicle employs a multi-reference frame controller\nto transition into a forward \xef\xac\x82ight con\xef\xac\x81guration.\nThe motors will be used for both the hovering and\nthe forward \xef\xac\x82ight portion of the mission. With\nthe motors being able to gimbal and using differential revolutions per minute (RPM), there will\nbe full control authority for operations without\nthe need for any additional control surfaces.\nFigure 3 shows the top view of the KP EAGLE vehicle with the half span, root chord and\ntip chord dimensions. An approximately 5 foot\nwingspan vehicle with a reference wing area of\n2.4 ft2 is similar to other vehicles in the weight\nclass and mission scenarios. For a more robust\ndesign, the vehicle contains sweep in order to\nopen up the CG allowable range. During the\npick up of the payload, there may be moments\nthat the CG will shift aft and therefore the vehicle should be designed to have a range of CG\nlocations that are acceptably reliable. Sweep assists in the ability to maintain stability, speci\xef\xac\x81cally pitch, throughout the picking up maneuver.\nIdeally the vehicle would have variable sweep capabilities for optimal \xef\xac\x82ight during each phase,\nsimilarly to how birds \xef\xac\x82y. However, for a \xef\xac\x81rst\niteration prototype and initial analysis the sweep\nwill be static. For simplicity in the vehicle design, an aircraft without a tail was desired. Traditionally a tailless vehicle comes with it\xe2\x80\x99s own\ncomplications, but in this mission scenario, complications are actually removed and saves weight.\nWithout tails, the vehicle does not have to worry\nabout tail strike during a pullout near the ground.\n\n5\n\nSTEVEN GEUTHER, FRANCISCO CAPRISTAN, JASON KIRK, RACHEAL ERHARD\n\nstiffening the airframe and having thicker airfoils,\nwhich degrade the performance of the overall vehicle.\n\nFig. 4 NACA 5206 re\xef\xac\x82exed.\n\nFig. 2 KP EAGLE vehicle.\n\nFinally an estimate of the performance of the\nvehicle in Fig. 2 can be seen in Fig. 5. The analysis was performed using a mix of tools including\nOpenVSP6 and XFLR57 . OpenVSP is an open\nsource parametric geometry tool that also has the\nability to predict parasitic drag directly from the\ngeometry using Hoerner Form Factor equations\nand Blasius laminar and turbulent skin friction\ncoef\xef\xac\x81cient equations. XFLR5 is an analysis tool\nfor airfoils, wings, and planes designed for low\nReynolds numbers, which provided the initial uncorrected performance of the vehicle.\n\nFig. 3 KP EAGLE vehicle top view (ft).\n\nIn order to prevent signi\xef\xac\x81cant stall effects, an\nairfoil and wing will be uniquely designed that\nwill be consistent with the requirements of having natural stability and \xef\xac\x82ight performance. Similar to designing an UAS for a unique mission\non Mars, a family of airfoils from the University\nof Illinois Urbana-Champaign airfoil database5\nwas investigated and altered until desired performance was achieved [8]. In Fig. 4, an airfoil\nwas designed based upon the NACA 5206 for\nboth the ability to maintain simplicity by providing re\xef\xac\x82ex to handle the pitching moment instead\nof a tail and for performance pushing the stall\npoint to a higher angle of attack. The airfoil is\nrelatively thin and must be reinforced to maintain the stiffness in the wing with spars and composites. There is a signi\xef\xac\x81cant trade off between\nhaving the additional weight from materials for\n5 http://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html\n\nFig. 5 L/D vs \xce\xb1 for the KP EAGLE concept.\n\nThe lift generated by the vehicle is computed\nby\n1\nL = \xcf\x81V 2 SrefCL\n(1)\n2\nwhere \xcf\x81 represents the air density, V the freestream velocity, Sref the reference area, and CL\nthe lift coef\xef\xac\x81cient. From Eq. 1 it can be observed that lift is sensitive to the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s velocity. Therefore, higher velocities during the\npickup maneuver would provide higher payload\n6 http://openvsp.org/\n7 http://www.x\xef\xac\x82r5.com/x\xef\xac\x82r5.htm\n\n6\n\nA VTOL Small Unmanned Aircraft System to Expand Payload Capabilities\n\ncapabilities. The vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s velocity is restricted\nby dynamic and structural considerations.\n\n5.2\n\nGrasping Mechanism\n\nTwo grasping mechanisms were considered. The\n\xef\xac\x81rst option consisted of using a robotic arm with\na passive system to capture the payload as seen\nin Figs. 6 and 7. Preliminary analysis suggested that such a con\xef\xac\x81guration introduced large\nmoments that the vehicle is not able to handle.\nThese moments are the result of the large speeds\nat which the maneuver must take place in order to\nsuccessfully pick up the payload. These moments\ncan be reduced by \xef\xac\x82ying at a slower speed but\nthis leads to a decrease in lift capabilities which\ntranslates to a decrease in payload. The second\noption involved using ideas previously employed\nin banner towing, where an advertising banner is\ntowed by an aircraft. In banner towing, the aircraft takes off without the banner and then picks\nup the banner by using a hooking mechanism that\nuses a tow rope attached to the aircraft. The option investigated uses a string similar to a \xef\xac\x81shing\nline and a passive hooking mechanism (similar to\nFigs. 6 and 7) that would allow the payload to\nbe picked without the addition of extra moments.\nThe string is retracted once the payload has been\npicked. This allows the payload to be closer to\nthe vehicle; thus, minimizing drag and adverse\nswinging motion dynamics.\n\nFig. 7 Grasping mechanism.\n\n5.3\n\nDynamics of Pickup Maneuver\n\nMost of the complexities in designing the vehicle are derived from the payload pickup maneuver. Preliminary analysis assisted in selecting the\ngrasping mechanism that would work best. A rotating arm of \xef\xac\x81xed length was initially considered, but it was determined to be infeasible for\nthe speci\xef\xac\x81c con\xef\xac\x81guration being studied due to the\nlarge moments the vehicle experienced. In contrast, the selected mechanism discussed in Section 5.2 decreases the moment experienced by the\nvehicle and changes it to a force applied at the\ncenter of gravity. A simpli\xef\xac\x81ed free body diagram\nof the vehicle is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nFig. 8 Free body diagram.\n\nFig. 6 Grasping mechanism.\n\nIn order to pick up the payload, the thrust and\nlift forces must counteract the drag force, vehicle weight, and tension due to the payload. The\nresulting propulsion, aerodynamic, and weight\n7\n\nSTEVEN GEUTHER, FRANCISCO CAPRISTAN, JASON KIRK, RACHEAL ERHARD\n\nforces experienced by the vehicle are given by\nEqs. 2 to 4\nFT =\n\nFa =\n\nFTx\nT cos(\xce\xb8)\n=\nFTy\nT sin(\xce\xb8)\n\nFax\n\xe2\x88\x92(L sin(\xce\xb3) + D cos(\xce\xb3))\n=\nFay\nL cos(\xce\xb3) \xe2\x88\x92 D sin(\xce\xb3)\n\nFW =\n\nFWx\n\xe2\x88\x92Wp cos(\xce\xbd)\n=\nFWy\n\xe2\x88\x92Wp sin(\xce\xbd) \xe2\x88\x92W\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T , L, D, W , Wp represent the thrust magnitude, lift, drag, vehicle weight, and payload\nweight respectively. The angle \xce\xb3 represents the\n\xef\xac\x82ight path angle, \xce\xb8 measures the angle between\nthe thrust and the horizon, and \xce\xbd is the angle between the horizon and the cable used to pick up\nthe payload. The angle of attack can be computed\nby\n\xce\xb1 = \xce\xb8\xe2\x88\x92\xce\xb3\n(5)\nThe acceleration of the vehicle must be\ngreater than zero for the pick-up maneuver to be\nfeasible. This can be easily computed by\n1\n(FT + Fa + FW )\n(6)\nm\nwhere m is the mass of the vehicle.\nA preliminary weight estimate suggests that\nthe vehicle will weigh approximately 7.5 lbs\nFrom previously designed and prototyped vehicles, the air frame of a similar sized vehicle will\nbe approximately 7 lbs. The remaining 0.5 lbs\nwill allow for the complexity of a retractable\ngrasping mechanism or additional structure reinforcement. The thrust obtained from each propeller is adjusted to 5 lbf (10 lbf total). Also, the\npayload is assumed to weigh 7.5 lbs to ensure that\na 1:1 payload to weight ratio. By using Eq. 6 and\nassuming that the angle of attack obtained during\nthe pickup maneuver is 10 degrees, it is possible\nto obtain a net acceleration in the y axis. Further\nanalysis is required with a prototype to better understand aerodynamic penalties and the effects of\na temporary swinging payload.\na=\n\n6\n\nConcluding Remarks and Future Work\n\nThe KP EAGLE concept has the potential of improving the current delivery capabilities of UASs\nby using a novel approach to handle payloads.\nPreliminary analysis indicates that the KP EAGLE concept is feasible to handle a 1:1 payload\nto weight ratio. Future work will include the development and building of a prototype to further\ncon\xef\xac\x81rm the preliminary analysis and provide the\ninformation needed for more detailed analysis.\nFurther work in identifying GPS technology and\nhigh data rate sensors needed to locate the payload and perform the pick up and perching maneuvers at precise locations. Advanced battery\nand motor technology can increase the payload\ncapability while avoiding battery weight penalties. Testing to investigate the g-forces expected\nduring the pickup maneuver will be performed to\nensure structural integrity.\nOther potential modi\xef\xac\x81cations of this concept\ninclude acquiring the payload on a moving surface (e.g., truck or train). This modi\xef\xac\x81cation\nwould allow the KP EAGLE concept to decrease\nstructural and dynamic constraints while allowing for an even higher payload to weight ratio.\nReferences\n[1] Thipphavong D, Apaza R, Barmore B, Battiste\nV, Burian B, Dao Q, Feary M, Go S, Goodrich\nK, Homola J, Idris H, Kopardekar P, Lachter J,\nNeogi N, Ng H, Oseguera-Lohr R, Patterson M,\nand Verma S.
