You can visit the Space Station mock-up here in Huntsville;\nyou are all welcome\nto\nvisit and use the Columbus\nfacilities at ESTEC in the Netherlands.\n\nFirst Aspect, the Columbus\nelements will be used as laboratories,\nwhich means a place where we are\nproviding\ncapabilities\nfor doing experiments,\ni.e. power, computers ....\nand as space laboratories,\nwhich means a place where we are taking benefit of the space environment,\ni.e. altitude, vacuum and\nmicrogravity.\nthe Columbus\nAs a matter\n\nIt must be pointed out that scientific utilisation\nis not the only driver for developing\nelements.\nTo make man live and work in space is also a key objective.\n\nof fact, most of the science\n\nwe plan to do onboard\n\nthe Space Station\n\nthe Space Station, except for Life Sciences, which are obviously\nspace.\nWe can do Astronomy,\nEarth Observation,\nTechnology\nFluid Sciences,\nwithout the Space Station and WE DO.\n\nPREGEDING\n\nPAGE\n\nBLANK\n\ncould be done without\n\nlinked to the presence\nExperiments,\nMaterial\n\nNOT\n\nFILMED\n\nof man in\nSciences,\n\n175\n\nHowever,\nwe shall use, and extensively\nuse, the Space Station because, first, it is there, but not only\nbecause it is there. Compared\nto other means to do science in space, and especially\nregular satellites,\nthe Space Station has key features that make it a unique tool for science.\n1.\n\nThe\n\nStation\n\npermits\n\nus to avoid\n\nthe transport\n\nthrough\n\nthe\n\natmosphere\n\nof all resources\n\nnecessary\nto make an experiment,\neach time you wish to make an experiment.\nThe resources\nstay\nin orbit and you can limit the transport to just instruments,\nwhich is a big advantage\nwhen you know\nthat, for example, Spacelab\nis 13 tons for 3 tons of instruments.\nThe key is to carry less through the\natmosphere.\n2.\nregular\n\nThe Station has large utilisation\nresources,\nat least one order of magnitude\nsatellite - 30 kw, tenth of square metres, hundreds\nof cubic metres.\n\n3.\n\nThe Station\n\nis permanently\n\nthat you can change,\navailable.\n4.\nStation\n\nThe Station\nis a unique\n\navailable\n\nyou can repair,\n\nwith an access\n\nand you can introduce\n\nis manned, which can be very useful,\ntool for scientific utilisation.\n\nThe Second Aspect I would\nelements.\nThese capabilities\n\nlike to address\nare twofold:\n\ncapabilities,\nand operate.\n\nevery\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAccommodation\naccommodate\n\nwhich\n\nmean\n\nthe\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEnvironmental\ncapabilities,\ni.e. the microgravity\nthe requirements\nof experimenters\nand which\nMicrogravity\nIsolation Mounts.\n\ntwo to three months,\n\nnew\n\ntechnology\n\neven if not mandatory.\n\nis the capabilities\n\nwhich\n\nnumber\n\nabove\n\nand\n\nwhich\n\nof a\n\nmeans\n\nas soon as they are\n\nTherefore,\n\nare offered\ntype\n\nthose\n\nthe Space\n\nby the Columbus\n\nof instruments\n\nyou\n\ncan\n\nenvironment\nfor instance, which must satisfy\ncould be improved\nby the development\nof\n\nAs for the accommodation\ncapabilities,\nI would like to comment\non two key words:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nmultidiscipline,\nwhich means that we have to satisfy the requirements\nof a wide range of users;\n\xe2\x80\xa2\ncooperation,\nwhich means that we have to take the best benefit of the overall capabilities\nand\nresources\nwhich are available,\ni.e. avoiding\nduplication\nbetween the partners.\nAbout\n\nthe multidiscipline\n\naspect,\n\nwe consider\n\nthat it would\n\nbe a mistake\n\nto limit the users\n\nto a few\n\ncategories,\nconsidering\nthe 30 years of utilisation\nin front of us. Five years ago, the favourite\nusers\nwere among\nthe Material\nSciences\ntype of users; today the favourite\nusers are with Human\nPhysiology\nbecause of space exploration;\nperhaps five years from now they will be recruited in the\nbiology field, and I trust the scientists to have dynamism enough for proposing\ncompletely\nnew ideas\non how to use space environment\n20 years from now. We have to, therefore, be prepared to face this\nevolution,\nand our plans are balancing\nthe utilisation\nof Columbus\namong all present user communities.\nI shall come back to cooperation\nlater on and let me show you now some material on existing ground\nfacilities, available to prepare the utilisation\nof Columbus.\nThe Columbus\nAttached Laboratory\nfull\nsize mock-up\nincludes:\n-\n\n176\n\nthe real interfaces\nbetween the Laboratory\nsystem and the payload racks;\nbreadboards\nof typical payload and of the General Purpose Workbench;\na Telescience\ntestbed simulating\nthe interactive\npayload operations;\n\n-\n\na Crew Work\nastronauts;\nan Automation\n\nStation\n\ntestbed\n\nand Robotics\n\nevaluating\ntestbed\n\nall technologies\n\nevaluating\n\nthe capabilities\n\nable\n\nto enhance\n\nthe\n\nof a multi-purpose\n\nIn addition to these ground facilities, extensive\nutilisation\nof underwater\ncomplete\nthe preparation\nof Columbus\nutilisation\non ground.\n\nrole\n\nof the\n\nrobot.\n\ntests and parabolic\n\nflights\n\nI would like to conclude\nmy presentation\nwith the international\naspect:\nThe Space Station is an\ninternational\nventure;\nwe are partners\nwith rights and duties.\nThese rights and duties are clearly\ndefined in the Space Station agreements,\nthe IGA and MOUs. But we have to go beyond these papers\nand to practise this cooperation,\nand this is the reason why the preparation\nof the utilisation\nof the\nSpace Station must be truly international\nat both levels, user and agency levels, utilisation\nand\noperational\nlevels.\nTo practise cooperation\nis the best way to realise that cooperation\ndoes not exclude competition\nand\nthat the combination\nof cooperation\nand competition\nis very fruitful. We know that in Europe, where\n13 countries\nare cooperating\nthrough the European\nSpace Agency.\nThis cooperation\nis already under way:\n1. With NASA, thanks to the IML flights and a cooperative\nagreement\non the EURECA\nreflights.\n2.\nWith all the Space Station partners in order to ensure common\ninterfaces\nfor the users and, in\norder to share the common equipment\non board.\nThis cooperation\ndoes not exclude any partner and, therefore,\nI am confident\nthat the Space Station\nwill offer a new era of space activities,\nand just to show you what is true cooperation,\nlet me show\nyou the first advertisement\nI have discovered\nfor Columbus\nin a US newspaper...\n\n177\n\n"
