A low-cost personal lightning detector offers a significant safety advantage to private flyers, boaters, golfers and others. Developed by Airborne Research Associates, the detectors originated in Space Shuttle tests of an optical lightning detection technique. The commercial device is pointed toward a cloud to detect invisible intracloud lightning by sensing subtle changes in light presence. The majority of the sales have been to golf courses. Additional products and more advanced applications are in progress.", "title": "A Personal Storm Warning Service", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080132, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080132, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "9e07d1430ac5467aae8da92b95c217b0", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080132.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080132/downloads/20020080132.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080132/downloads/20020080132.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080132/downloads/20020080132.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
