CREASY/HEAD, PAYLOAD SUPPORT OPERATIONS SECTION\nMMAG/C.D.LEVY/ MANAGER OF HOUSTON OPERATIONS\nNOVEMBER 1989\nOVERVIEW\nThis paper addresses concepts for vehicle and payload avionics architectures\nfor future NASA programs, including the Assured Shuttle Access program, Space\nStation Freedom (SSF), Shuttle-C, Advanced Manned Launch System (AMLS), and\nthe Lunar/Mars programs.\nEmphasis is on the potential available to increase\npayload services which will be required in the future, while decreasing the\noperational cost/complexity by utilizing state of the art advanced avionics\nsystems and a distributed processing architecture.\nAlso addressed are the\ntrade studies required to determine the optimal degree of vehicle (NASA) to\npayload (customer) separation and the ramifications of these decisions.\nMAJOR OBJECTIVES\nThe avionics payload support architecture for future NASA space programs is\ndesigned to meet several major objectives.\nThe typical customer vehicle\navionics requirements include reliable provision for command, telemetry,\nvideo services, onboard data storage capability, and the capability to access\nvehicle data (e.g., attitude, state vehicle, timing, etc.) through some sort\nof "gateway".\nThe extent and requirement for these services depends upon the\ntype of payload (deployable, attached, scientific experiment, etc.) and the\ntype of mission (e.g., short versus long duration).\nA deployable payload\nwhich only resides in the NSTS orbiter for a few hours on-orbit typically\nrequires different services than will attached SSF scientific experiments.\nFrom the NASA budgetary perspective, it is important to utilize an avionics\npayload support architecture which reduces the labor intensive integration,\nflight to flight reconfiguration process, mission operations support and\ncrew/controller training.\nIn order to accomplish this, it is desirable to reduce the interdependence of\nthe vehicle and payload where practical.\nBy selectively designing the\npayload architecture to include a separate distributed payload data\nmanagement system, including separate data storage as well as processing\nequipment, the payload capabilities are not limited by competition with the\nvehicle\'s requirements and the payload schedule is not tled to a mature\nvehicle\'s reconfiguration\nschedule.\n(See figure I.)\nIt would also be\ndesirable to have a separate upllnk and downlink capability for the same\nreasons as outlined above.\nThis capability may be more of a cost impact and\nmust be weighed as such.\nAn additional consideration in the design of the avionics payload support\narchitecture is the utilization of government or industry standards such as\nthe 80386 processor, the 1750A processor, the 1553 data bus, etc.\nThis will\nenhance the budgetary aspect of the program by allowing the use of commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software, as well as providing the customer\nwith standards for their design and software development that match those\n\nPRE\'CEDII\'_G\n\nP_GE\n\nBLANK\n639\n\nNOT\n\nFILMED\n\navailable on the open market.\nAdditionally, a customer could then transition\neasily from host program to host program (e.g., Shuttle to Space Station\nFreedom) without major electronic redesign.\nOther benefits to this approach\nwould be derived if the system was designed to allow provision for program\ninterchangeability\nof components and the capability to easily upgrade the\nsystem as new capabilities are developed.\nMAJOR MILESTONES\nThe concept of the use of a distributed avionics support architecture for\npayload applications is not a new one.\nIt was proposed in the 1970\'s during\nthe design phase for the NSTS orbiter.\nIt was not implemented due to\nphilosophical and budgetary considerations.\nAs a result, the STS currently\nassumes an increased cost for payload reconflguration flight to flight, does\nnot provide sophistication in payload software control, provides minimal\npayload data storage capability, provides only minimal vehicle data to major\npayloads, and provides no vehicle avionics services to the scientific\nexperiments flown in the middeck.\nIn order to alleviate some of these\nconcerns, and with the advent of the microcomputer technology, the STS is now\nproviding customers with the option of using the STS payload and general\nsupport computer (PGSC), which is a modified GRID 1530.\nThe STS-provided\nPGSC is flight qualified.\nIts utilization is under configuration control by\nthe STS relative to the user interface.\nThis insures standardization\nin\norder to reduce crew/ground training and simplify procedure development.\nThe\nInterface Control Document (ICD) and user guidelines for the PGSC were\npublished in 1989 and the system flew on STS-30 and STS-34 for the Fluids\nExperiment Apparatus (FEA) and Polymer Morphology (PM) payloads,\nrespectively.\nNumerous other payloads have requested its use. Most notable\nis the Tethered Satellite System (TSS).\nThe PGSC does not directly have a llnk to the orbiter communication system\nwhich limits ground control of experiments.\nThis, in turn, potentially\nlimits scientific return from payloads and also places a greater burden on\nthe flightcrew (training and timeline impact).\nIn some applications, such as\nTSS, this is overcome by use of the STS smart flexible\nmultlplexer/demultiplexer\n(SFMDM) which is connected to both the orbiter\ncommunications system, as well the PGSC.\nAnother major milestone toward the recommended payload support architecture\nwas the original SSF payload support architecture definition.\nIt included a\ndistributed processing architecture, standardized testing, checkout, and\ntraining, and, in general,a decoupllng of vehicle and payload services.\nUnfortunately, the 1989 budgetary scrub exercise resulted in the potential\ndeletion of many of the distributed payload avionics capabllltles at the\nPermanent Manned Configuration (PMC) such as a separate payload local area\nnetwork (LAN), separate payload data storage capability, and separate payload\ncommand uplink capability.\nIt was proposed that this configuration would be\neventually upgraded with the later full-up configuration.\nOf concern is that\nthe full-up configuration is not funded and will itself probably be\nconfronted with a stringent budget.\nIn addition, the cost and labor required\nto upgrade the system by the astronauts will be time consuming and complex.\nThe Shuttle-C payload services definition served as another milestone.\nAlthough the proposed payload services provided by the Shuttle-C are somewhat\n\n64O\n\nminimal, it did propose placing the majority\nresponsibility on the payload customer\nintegration and operations costs.\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nof the payload\nand thus simplifying\n\nservices\nthe payload\n\nISSUES\n\nSome technology issues exist for the above mentioned programs.\nFor the STS\norbiter, the issues and work that are ahead as part of the Assured Shuttle\nAccess program include replacing certain components such as the pulse code\nmodulator master unit (PCMMU)/payload data interleaver (PDI) due to parts\nobsolescence.\nThis opens the opportunity to enhance the downlink data\ncapability as well as provides redundancy in the payload PDI link.\nCost,\nschedule impacts to vehicles in the flow, and compatibility with the orbiter\ncommunications system are issues being worked in this area.\nAnother item\nunder investigation is the replacement of the orbiter payload recorder with\none more suitable to the typical payload\'s bit rates and data recording\nrequirements.\nAnother technology issue relates to the need for further\nadvances in connector and cabling design in order to reduce both volume and\nweight.\nThis is, of course, a concern with all of the programs.\nAnother\narea that needs further work is to develop a capability, via modem or a\nseparate SFMDM type "black box", to provided communication services to\norbiter payloads, such as middeck scientific experiments.\nThe major technology issues for the SSF program, relative to avionics payload\nsupport architecture, are in the integration of existing avionics\ntechnologies to control multiple real-time systems and limited vehicle\nresources, such as power, communication, assets, etc.\nThe Lunar/Mars programs require more sophisticated avionics capabilities in\norder to meet the expected needs of these payloads over extended periods of\ntime and with a greater communication lag between the ground operation team\n(including scientists) and the vehicle.\nThis will lead to an increased\nrequirement for automation and expert systems capability.\nIn addition, it is\nestimated that the data storage capability required for some payloads which\nare proposed for the Mars mission would be on the order of 1X10E12 bytes,\nwhich is two orders of magnitude greater than what is currently available.\nIn addition to this need for increased onboard data storage, it is\nanticipated that there will be a requirement for some level of\npretransmission data compression for the Mars mission which has historically\nbeen a concern to the vehicle and scientific communities.\nAnother area which warrants further exploration for each of the NASA programs\nIs advancement in technology to increase the operational efficiency of the\nabove programs in areas such as automation, robotics, expert systems, voice\nrecognition, speaker independent systems,enhanced video display capability,\netc.\nTRADE STUDIES\nPerhaps more important than the technology issues mentioned above are the\ntrade studies that are required to determine the NASA position relative to\nthe payload community.\nThe overall concern is the appropriate degree of\nNASA/user separation.\nThis lies at the heart of many policy decisions\nrelative to the handling of payloads.\nThe question concerns the balance of\n\n641\n\ncommon services provided by the vehicle (NASA responsibility) versus those\nprovided by the customer (user responsibility).\nFor example, If the Agency\nwere to provide an industry standard architecture (ISA) processor with\ndisplay capability, an I/O consisting of MIL-STD-1553B data busses, storage\nmedium, and access to vehicle system data vla a gateway, should the Agency\nprovide the real-time ADA operating system with the application software\nbeing the responsibility of the user?\nIf so, what is the interface criteria\nbetween the operating system and the application programs?\nWhere does the\nresponsibility lie between NASA and the customer?\nWould NASA supply the\nbackground display structure and the customer provide the dynamic fill to\nreduce and minimize crew training, whether ground or flight?\nIs there some\ninterface llne that can be drawn between host vehicle and user\nresponsibilities\nthat is beneficial to both In cost and integration schedule\nflexibility?\nIf this type of standardization is used (in the example), the\ncustomer can utilize relatively inexpensive ground versions of the flight\nhardware for software development, validation, and payload checkout.\nWhen\ndrawing this "line", developing a policy, or developing a criteria, serious\ndeliberation and consideration should be given to safety (i.e., when can\nclosed loop control not be implemented by the customer), mission success,\nreliability and/or redundancy, minimizing crew training, integration of the\ncargo complement (i.e., multiple payloads), and data processing security\n(i.e., protection of customer proprietary information).\nSUMMARY/RECOMMENDATIONS\nIn summary, It is important to keep in mind that the major goal of the\noperational NASA missions is related to payload/experiment\nactivity, be It\ndeployment of a satellite or a long-range scientific experiment.\nIt is\nimportant to insure that the NASA programs provide services to make those\nprograms, whether it is Shuttle-If, SSF, or some advanced upper stage,\naccessible to users.\nIn addition, it Is important for NASA to make\nresponsible decisions In the design of its programs to insure that they have\nnot cut costs for DDT&E, which will result in increased costs in the outyears that significantly exceed what would have been the initial DDT&E cost\ninvestment.\nIt Is time for the Agency to address commonality between\nprograms to reduce DDT&E cost and "redesign the wheel" tendencies. It is\nequally important that these designs provide the user a low cost means to\nutilize the host vehicle capabilities without complex, tlme consuming\nintegration processes, which is a major complaint of shuttle users.\nProgram\ncommonality and simplified integration processes with respect to payload\naccommodations provides the same cost and labor benefits to the customer that\ncould be realized by NASA.\nCommonality provides options to the user for\naccess to space.\nIn simple terms, more programs and more experiments could\nbe started, developed, and flown for the same budget, if cross program\navionics commonality is imposed In the out years.\nHowever, DDT&E monies must\nbe expended now to realize such a benefit.\nIn order to further pursue these areas, several things must be accomplished.\nDevelopment of a payload/host vehicle policy Is required to distribute\nresponsibility, when practical and cost effective, to the user.\nIt may be\nnecessary to rearrange these responsibilities based on the type of host\nvehicle (i.e., Shuttle-II versus Shuttle-C).\nWhatever the result, this\npolicy should provide a framework for avionics hardware and software\n\n642\n\ncommonality\nseparation\n\nbetween a11 host\nof responsibilities\n\nvehlcle\nprograms\nand should dellneate\nbetween host vehicle\nand user.\n\nthe\n\nAn avionics payload support architecture must then be developed to support\nthe resultant policies.\nParamount to this design Is addressing\nstandardization-use of those industry or government standards that impose\nprogram cross utilization, a means of technology evolution to resolve parts\nobsolescence concerns.\nThe final system should also include functions that\nminimize the out years operating base, such as built in test and checkout.\nIt is in NASA\'s best interest to develop such a payload support architecture\nfor use across programs to use new avionics technology to increase operations\nefficiency and thus reduce recurring operations costs.\nKEY CONTACTS\nOther sources of information\nStan Blackmr/JSC/TJ2\n(STS)\n8111Mallary/JSC/EH\n(SSF)\nNed Trahan /JSC/EH\nCharlte\nPrice /JSC/EF\nC.
