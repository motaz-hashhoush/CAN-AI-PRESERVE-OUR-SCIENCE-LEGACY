There are also remotely\n\n35\n\nsensed soil moisture observations from missions like the European Space Agency\n\n36\n\n(ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA\xe2\x80\x9fs Soil Moisture Active\n\n37\n\nPassive (SMAP), however these time series are still too short to conduct studies that\n\n38\n\ndemonstrate the utility of these data for operational applications, or to provide historical\n\n39\n\ncontext for extreme wet or dry events.\n\n40\n\nTo promote the use of remotely sensed soil moisture in agricultural drought and\n\n41\n\nfood security monitoring, we use East Africa as a case study to evaluate the quality of a\n\n42\n\n30+ year time series of merged active-passive microwave soil moisture from the ESA\n\n43\n\nClimate Change Initiative (CCI-SM). Compared to the Normalized Difference Vegetation\n\n44\n\nindex (NDVI) and modeled soil moisture products, we found substantial spatial and\n\n45\n\ntemporal gaps in the early part of the CCI-SM record, with adequate data coverage\n\n46\n\nbeginning in 1992. From this point forward, growing season CCI-SM anomalies were\n\n47\n\nwell correlated (R>0.5) with modeled, seasonal soil moisture, and in some regions,\n\n48\n\nNDVI. We use correlation analysis and qualitative comparisons at seasonal time scales\n\n49\n\nto show that remotely sensed soil moisture can add information to a convergence of\n\n50\n\nevidence framework that traditionally relies on rainfall and NDVI in moderately\n\n51\n\nvegetated regions.\n\n52\n53\n54\n\nKey Words: Remotely sensed soil moisture, agricultural drought monitoring, food\nsecurity, East Africa\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n55\n56\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nAgricultural drought, or soil moisture deficit, reduces crop production and can\n\n57\n\nimpact a range of sectors \xe2\x80\x93 from individual households to global commodity markets.\n\n58\n\nWhile meteorological and crop conditions are of interest to a broad audience, many\n\n59\n\nplaces around the world lack in situ monitoring or don\xe2\x80\x9ft publicly report these data. In\n\n60\n\nthese instances, growing season conditions can be tracked using publicly available\n\n61\n\nsatellite data \xe2\x80\x93 most often rainfall and the normalized difference vegetation index\n\n62\n\n(NDVI). Modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture can also provide information,\n\n63\n\nbridging the gap between rainfall deficits and vegetation response.\n\n64\n\nHumanitarian organizations that provide emergency assistance before food\n\n65\n\ncrises arise rely almost entirely on remotely sensed rainfall and NDVI in a \xe2\x80\x9econvergence\n\n66\n\nof evidence\xe2\x80\x9f framework (Verdin et al., 2005). This approach uses multiple sources to\n\n67\n\nmitigate errors in any single product. Despite the potential benefits, inclusion of remotely\n\n68\n\nsensed and modeled soil moisture into humanitarian operations has been slow due to a\n\n69\n\nlack of near-real time data as well as lack of demonstrated utility. The Soil Moisture\n\n70\n\nActive Passive (SMAP) mission, launched in January 2015, is expected to provide\n\n71\n\nproducts that are both accurate (0.04 mm/mm error) and timely (estimates produced\n\n72\n\nevery 10 days) enough for agricultural monitoring (Entekhabi et al., 2010). There is still\n\n73\n\na need, however to demonstrate the utility of remotely sensed soil moisture for crop\n\n74\n\nmonitoring applications. This is particularly challenging in regions with insufficient in situ\n\n75\n\nmeasurements (both rainfall and soil moisture) for calibration of absolute values from\n\n76\n\nremotely sensed data and models. To cope with the resulting uncertainty, analysts can\n\n77\n\nuse derived moisture indices that have been standardized over time (e.g. the\n\n3\n\n1\n2\n3\n4 78\n5\n6\n7 79\n8\n9 80\n10\n11\n12 81\n13\n14 82\n15\n16\n17 83\n18\n19 84\n20\n21\n85\n22\n23\n24 86\n25\n26 87\n27\n28\n29 88\n30\n31 89\n32\n33\n34 90\n35\n36 91\n37\n38\n92\n39\n40\n41 93\n42\n43 94\n44\n45\n46 95\n47\n48 96\n49\n50\n51 97\n52\n53 98\n54\n55\n56 99\n57\n58 100\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\nStandardized Precipitation Index (SPI) McKee 1993), or percentile ranks (e.g. soil\nmoisture percentiles (Svoboda et al. 2002; Shefield and Wood 2008). A data record of\nat least 30 years is recommended for computing probability distributions that underpin\nstandardized metrics. In the case of microwave soil moisture, different satellite sensors\nneed to be merged to make a sufficiently long time record. This has motivated the\nEuropean Space Agency\xe2\x80\x9fs (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) to merge active and\npassive microwave sensors to produce a harmonized satellite derived soil moisture\ndataset covering 30+ years, from 1978-2013 (Liu et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2011; Wagner\net al., 2012).\nAs with all merged multi-sensor products, users of CCI soil moisture (CCI-SM)\nmust be aware of potential shifts in data that occur as sensors change over time. Dorigo\net al. (2014) evaluated CCI-SM using a global dataset of ground based stations. On\naverage, CCI-SM was moderately correlated (R absolute values=0.46, R anomalies=0.36) with\nstations and had an upward trend in quality over time with the exception of 2007-2010.\nJia et al. (2015) found similar results using in situ observations from China. Also in\nChina, Yuan et al. (2015) assessed the capability of CCI-SM to detect drought events in\nthe in situ data and modeled soil moisture record. They found that while CCI-SM\nmatched in situ observations for <60% of the dry events, it did capture inter-annual\nvariability commensurate with the reanalysis, especially in sparsely vegetated regions.\nIn a study over the Tibetan Plateau, Zeng et al. (2015) found the CCI-SM was better\ncorrelated with in situ data and reanalysis than individual sensor products.\nWhile the quality of CCI-SM has not been evaluated for regions in Africa\nspecifically, Dorigo et al. (2014)\xe2\x80\x9fs global analysis mapped the spatio-temporal coverage,\n\n4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n101\n\nand included four sites in West Africa from the AMMA network (Cappelaere et al.,\n\n102\n\n2009). At these sites CCI-SM was well correlated (R ~0.7) with absolute values but less\n\n103\n\nso (R~0.45) when the seasonal cycle was removed. McNally et al. (2015) found\n\n104\n\nstatistically significant (R>0.5) correlations between CCI-SM and modeled soil moisture\n\n105\n\nanomalies in West Africa and Traore et al. (2014) found good (R>0.5) correlations in\n\n106\n\nSouthern and Western Africa, but less so (R<0.3) in East Africa. Shukla et al. (2014)\n\n107\n\nalso included CCI-SM in qualitative comparison of showing how rainfall and modeled\n\n108\n\nsoil moisture z-scores represented an extreme drought in East Africa.\n\n109\n\nThe current paper extends the work of Dorigo et al. (2014) and aims to explicitly\n\n110\n\nevaluate CCI-SM in East Africa to facilitate the appropriate use of remotely sensed soil\n\n111\n\nmoisture in agricultural drought monitoring and food security assessment. Guided by\n\n112\n\nour association with the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), we\n\n113\n\nfocus our analysis on rain-fed agricultural regions (Figure 1a and 1b). Details about the\n\n114\n\nmodels, their inputs, CCI-SM and NDVI and our approach to analysis are in Section 2.\n\n115\n\nThe first part of Section 3 evaluates the spatial and temporal coverage, and the second\n\n116\n\npart compares CCI-SM with modeled soil moisture and NDVI to demonstrate where and\n\n117\n\nunder what conditions remotely sensed microwave soil moisture, from missions like\n\n118\n\nSMOS and SMAP, can benefit agricultural drought and food security monitoring.\n\n119\n\nSection 4 summarizes our contributions and discusses future research directions\n\n120\n\nregarding how CCI-SM, and other remotely sensed soil moisture estimates, can\n\n121\n\ncontribute to agricultural and food security assessment over regions where analysts\n\n122\n\ntypically rely on NDVI and rainfall data.\n\n123\n\n5\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n124\n125\n\n2. METHODS\nEast Africa is characterized by grassland and woody or shrub savanna\n\n126\n\nvegetation (Figure 1a). The topography ranges from flat to complex terrain (Figure 1b)\n\n127\n\nand soils range from clay to sand mixes (Nachtergaele et al., 2008). The region has a\n\n128\n\nmulti-modal rainfall regime that is initiated by the northward migration of the Intertropical\n\n129\n\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ) in the summer months (Davenport and Nicholson, 1993).\n\n130\n\nAnother characteristic of this region is the lack of ground-based observations for\n\n131\n\ncalibration and validation of remotely sensed rainfall and soil moisture.\n\n132\n\nOur analysis compares two land surface models (LSMs) and two remotely\n\n133\n\nsensed observational datasets (Table 1). The different components in Table 1 are\n\n134\n\ndescribed below.\n\n135\n\n2.1 LAND SURFACE MODELING FRAMEWORK\n\n136\n\nTo estimate soil moisture from rainfall and other meteorological inputs, we use\n\n137\n\ntwo models that are part of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) (Kumar et al.,\n\n138\n\n2008). The LIS software is a framework that facilitates the use of multiple land models,\n\n139\n\nparameter (e.g. vegetation) datasets, and meteorological inputs to generate ensemble\n\n140\n\nestimates of energy and water states and fluxes. More information on the current\n\n141\n\ncapabilities of the NASA LIS can be found on the website (http://lis.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\n\n142\n\nEventually this system will provide multi-model and multi-forcing ensemble outputs for\n\n143\n\nroutine FEWS NET decision support.\n\n144\n\nAlthough not a perfect model inter-comparison due to differences in model\n\n145\n\nparameters, including two land surface models allows us to capture some of the\n\n146\n\nuncertainty introduced by different model physics. The land surface models and\n\n6\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n147\n\nassociated data inputs that we used for this study are described in Table 1 and the\n\n148\n\nfollowing section.\n\n149\n\n2.1.1 NOAH 3.3\n\n150\n\nThe Noah LSM is a water and energy balance land surface model described in\n\n151\n\nChen et al. (1996), and model updates described in Wei et al. (2013). For this study we\n\n152\n\nused version 3.3 at 0.1o spatial resolution. To compute energy and water balance, Noah\n\n153\n\nrequires input meteorological variables, vegetation (land cover) type, and soil texture\n\n154\n\n(Table 1). We chose to use the Noah model for FEWS NET applications because it is\n\n155\n\nwidely used by the atmospheric and land modeling communities and therefore model\n\n156\n\nparameters are publicly available and well tested. Noah also has features that may be\n\n157\n\nuseful in the future, like data assimilation algorithms, irrigation modules and coupling to\n\n158\n\nthe Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). There are several examples of\n\n159\n\nNoah being used over East Africa (e.g. Anderson et al., 2012b, a; Yilmaz et al., 2014),\n\n160\n\ncoupled with the WRF in Kenya (Case et al., 2014) and in a multi-model drought\n\n161\n\nmonitor (Mo et al., 2012).\n\n162\n\n2.1.2 VIC\n\n163\n\nThe Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model is a semi-distributed macroscale\n\n164\n\nhydrologic model (Liang et al., 1994; Liang et al., 1996) that has been widely used at a\n\n165\n\nglobal scale and has been demonstrated to accurately capture the hydrology of different\n\n166\n\nregimes (Adam et al., 2006; Maurer et al., 2002; Nijssen et al., 1997; Nijssen et al.,\n\n167\n\n2001). It is the main model used by the Princeton Africa Drought Monitor (Sheffield et\n\n168\n\nal., 2014) and is a prototype for FEWS NET seasonal hydrologic forecasting (Shukla et\n\n169\n\nal., 2014). The NASA LIS instance of the VIC model is version 4.1.2, which we ran at\n\n7\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n170\n\n0.25o resolution. When run at a sub-daily time step in energy balance mode VIC\n\n171\n\nrequires the same suite of meteorological inputs as the Noah model. We chose the VIC\n\n172\n\nmodel for FEWS NET applications because it is widely used by the hydrologic\n\n173\n\nforecasting community in both the U.S. and Africa (Mo et al., 2012; Nijssen et al., 2014;\n\n174\n\nSheffield et al., 2014).\n\n175\n\nThe soil and vegetation parameters used for this study were originally developed\n\n176\n\nfor Princeton\xe2\x80\x9fs Africa Flood and Drought Monitor (http://hydrology.princeton.\n\n177\n\nedu/~nchaney/ADMML/), documented in Sheffield et al. (2014) and Chaney et al.\n\n178\n\n(2014), and described in more detail below and listed in Table 1.\n\n179\n\n2.1.3 VEGETATION\n\n180\n\nThe LIS configurations of Noah and VIC LSMs (see Table 1) use two different\n\n181\n\nstatic, global, 1-km resolution datasets of land cover classes. VIC uses the University of\n\n182\n\nMaryland (UMD) classification for the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n\n183\n\n(AVHRR) observations. Noah uses the Boston University-IGBP classification based on\n\n184\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x9fs Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations.\n\n185\n\nBoth models use different representations of satellite derived average monthly\n\n186\n\nvegetation phenology: VIC uses 1-km resolution leaf area index (LAI) (Myneni et al.,\n\n187\n\n1997), while Noah uses ~14km (0.144\xc2\xb0) resolution green vegetation fraction (GVF)\n\n188\n\nclimatologies from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) (Gutman\n\n189\n\nand Ignatov, 1998).\n\n190\n\nVIC\xe2\x80\x9fs additional vegetation type parameters like specific root length, minimum\n\n191\n\nstomatal resistance, architectural resistance, roughness length, and displacement\n\n192\n\nlength taken from Nijssen et al. (2001). Noah\xe2\x80\x9fs vegetation parameters are based on a\n\n8\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n193\n\nlookup table available from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)\n\n194\n\nResearch Applications Laboratory (RAL) website\n\n195\n\n(http://www.ral.ucar.edu/research/land/technology/lsm.php)\n\n196\n\n2.1.4 SOILS\n\n197\n\nFor this study, the soil type maps used in LIS-Noah 3.3 were derived from\n\n198\n\n0.083\xc2\xb0(5 min) resolution global soils dataset of Reynolds et al. (2000), and available\n\n199\n\nfrom NCAR RAL website mentioned above. LIS-Noah includes a routine to classify soil\n\n200\n\ntexture based on percentages of sand, silt and clay in a given grid cell and are\n\n201\n\nassociated with various soil parameters found in a lookup table available from the\n\n202\n\nNCAR RAL website. For VIC, soil texture and bulk density were from Batjes (1997),\n\n203\n\nother soil parameters from Cosby et al. (1984) were calibrated, following the method of\n\n204\n\nTroy et al. (2008), against runoff fields derived by Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC)\n\n205\n\ngauges in Africa, described in Shukla et al. (2014).\n\n206\n\n2.1.5 PRECIPTIATION AND METEROLOGICAL INPUTS\n\n207\n\nThere are a variety of options for long-term rainfall datasets. Maidment (2014)\n\n208\n\nprovides a comprehensive summary of rainfall datasets that extend for over 30 years.\n\n209\n\nThis study uses the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data,\n\n210\n\nCHIRPS v2.0, a quasi-global rainfall dataset available from 1981 to present, designed\n\n211\n\nfor seasonal drought monitoring and trend analysis (Funk et al., 2014). This data set\n\n212\n\nwas developed and is updated at near-real time by the United States Geological Survey\n\n213\n\n(USGS) in collaboration with the Climate Hazards Group of the Department of\n\n214\n\nGeography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. CHIRPS is generated by\n\n215\n\nblending together three different data sets: (1) global 0.05\xc2\xb0 precipitation climatology, (2)\n\n9\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n216\n\ntime varying grids of satellite-based and climate model precipitation estimates, and (3)\n\n217\n\nin situ precipitation observations. This data set has been compared to other global\n\n218\n\nprecipitation data sets such as the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (Huffman et\n\n219\n\nal., 2009), which is in agreement over our area of interest (Figure 1) (Peterson et al.,\n\n220\n\n2014). For these model experiments we spatially aggregated CHIRPS using nearest-\n\n221\n\nneighbor interpolation, to 0.1\xc2\xb0 and 0.25\xc2\xb0 resolution for Noah and VIC, respectively. And,\n\n222\n\nbecause energy balance calculations require atmospheric inputs at sub-daily model\n\n223\n\ntime steps, these data were temporally disaggregated from daily to 6-hrly (4\n\n224\n\nobservations per day) using NCEP\xe2\x80\x9fs Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR;\n\n225\n\nhttp://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds093.1/).\n\n226\n\nIn addition to precipitation, Noah and VIC use temperature, humidity, downward\n\n227\n\nshortwave and longwave radiation, wind (zonal and meridional), and surface pressure.\n\n228\n\nFor these variables, we used hourly averages from the Modern Era Retrospective\n\n229\n\nAnalysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) dataset (Reichle et al., 2011).\n\n230\n\nMERRA is available at a horizontal resolution of 2/3\xc2\xb0 longitude by 1/2\xc2\xb0 latitude and from\n\n231\n\n1 January 1980 onwards. The LIS software applies a bilinear spatial interpolation\n\n232\n\nalgorithm to convert the forcing data to match the 0.1\xc2\xb0 or 0.25\xc2\xb0 resolution required by\n\n233\n\nthe Noah and VIC models, respectively.\n\n234\n235\n\n2.2 REMOTELY SENSED SOIL MOISUTURE AND VEGETATION\n\n236\n\n2.2.1 ESA CCI Microwave Soil Moisture.\n\n237\n238\n\nThe ESA\xe2\x80\x9fs CCI monitors a suite of Essential Climate Variables (ECV), one of\nwhich is soil moisture. The CCI-SM is available from 1979-2013 at 0.25\xc2\xb0 spatial\n\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n239\n\nresolution and daily temporal resolution, which we aggregated to monthly and seasonal\n\n240\n\ntime-steps (9- and 3- month).\n\n241\n\nThe CCI goal is to produce a complete and consistent global soil moisture data\n\n242\n\nrecord based on passive (radiometer) products (SMMR, SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR2,\n\n243\n\nWindsat) and active (radar/scatterometer) products (ERS-1/2, METOP-A 1991-2013).\n\n244\n\nPassive radiometers are insensitive to weather and moderate vegetation cover and can\n\n245\n\naccurately distinguish between wet (cold) and dry (warm) soils. The downsides are that,\n\n246\n\nfor agricultural monitoring, the spatial resolution is course (30-50 KM) and none of the\n\n247\n\nsensors currently included in CCI-SM use the optimal L-band for soil moisture retrievals.\n\n248\n\nIn contrast, active radars have a finer spatial resolution (3-25 KM) but lower soil\n\n249\n\nmoisture sensitivity.\n\n250\n\nThe complementary strengths of the passive and active products have led to\n\n251\n\ndevelopment of merging algorithms. For CCI-SM, the microwave retrieved surface soil\n\n252\n\nmoisture data is merged from the different sensors (Dorigo et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012;\n\n253\n\nLiu et al., 2011) and the absolute soil moisture value is scaled to the 25km GLDAS-1\n\n254\n\nNoah soil moisture. The CCI-SM Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Document (2013)\n\n255\n\nstates that in the scaling procedure the \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal variability and trends of the original\n\n256\n\ndatasets are generally well preserved.\xe2\x80\x9d Data quality flags are provided, and were used\n\n257\n\nto mask pixels with dense vegetation, no data collected, lack of merging algorithm\n\n258\n\nconvergence and frozen or snow covered soils. Overall, the merged active and passive\n\n259\n\nproducts have been shown to be superior to either the passive or active alone (Liu et\n\n260\n\nal., 2011).\n\n261\n\n2.2.2 GIMMS NDVI\n\n11\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n262\n\nNDVI is regularly used by food security analysts at FEWS NET (Verdin et al.,\n\n263\n\n2005) for convergence of evidence with precipitation statistics. Comparisons between\n\n264\n\nNDVI, rainfall and soil moisture allow us to evaluate the added value of soil moisture\n\n265\n\nproducts, like CCI-SM, and its potential use in applications like FEWS NET.\n\n266\n\nWe use the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI\n\n267\n\nproduct, which is derived from imagery obtained from AVHRR instrument and is\n\n268\n\navailable from 1982 to 2013 (Pinzon et al., 2005; Pinzon and Tucker 2014; Tucker et al.,\n\n269\n\n2005). AVHRR NDVI has been used extensively over different regions of Africa.\n\n270\n\nNicholson et al. (1990) compared relationships between NDVI and rainfall over the\n\n271\n\nSahel and East Africa. The relationship was linear over the Sahel but log-linear in East\n\n272\n\nAfrica where vegetation canopy densities are higher.\n\n273\n\nWhile the GIMMS NDVI (1982-2013) and CCI-SM\xe2\x80\x9fs period of record (1978-2013)\n\n274\n\nlimits their utility for drought monitoring, these datasets do provide us a sufficiently long\n\n275\n\nrecord to evaluate the potential contributions of similar near-real time products from\n\n276\n\nmodels or satellite sensors with shorter records.\n\n277\n278\n279\n\n2.3 ANALYSIS APPROACH\nDorigo et al. (2014) explored the spatio-temporal data availability for the entire\n\n280\n\n1979-2010 period of record as well as the different periods of sensor-blending at the\n\n281\n\nglobal scale. They show an increase in observation density over time that results from\n\n282\n\nmore satellites and daily overpasses as well as improvements to instrument design. We\n\n283\n\nconducted a similar analysis with the CCI-SM dataset using the most recent update that\n\n284\n\nspans 1979-2013.\n\n12\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n285\n\nDifferent from other analyses, we focused on crop growing regions of East Africa\n\n286\n\nwhere CCI-SM may be useful for food security and drought monitoring applications. We\n\n287\n\nused a generalized cropping zone mask which is based on (1) the United Nations Food\n\n288\n\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO) Africover (http://www.glcn.org/activities/\n\n289\n\nafricover_en.jsp) landuse-landcover maps of herbaceous crop zones and (2) FEWS\n\n290\n\nNET livelihood zone, and commodity and trade maps for major staples (e.g. maize)\n\n291\n\n(Gideon Galu, personal communication, July 2015). This mask is also used in the crop\n\n292\n\nwater balance model geoWRSI (Senay and Verdin, 2002; Verdin and Klaver, 2002).\n\n293\n\nData were additionally masked to the available NDVI domain and Noah landmask\n\n294\n\n(derived from MODIS) to eliminate water bodies.\n\n295\n\nNext we computed z-scores for CCI-SM, the upper layers of VIC and Noah (both\n\n296\n\n0-10 cm top layer depth), GIMMS NDVI, and CHIRPS rainfall, averaged over both\n\n297\n\nspace and time for March-September. We compared the different datasets at this scale\n\n298\n\nto determine when CCI-SM data quality was sufficient for further analysis. We then\n\n299\n\ncomputed and mapped pairwise rank correlations of monthly (not shown) and 3-monthly\n\n300\n\n(January-February-March, April-May-June, July-August-September, October-\n\n301\n\nNovember-December) (not shown), and seasonal (March-September) z-scores from\n\n302\n\n1992-2013.\n\n303\n\nAfter assessing the general patterns of agreement between the different\n\n304\n\nproducts, we use correlation and qualitative comparisons to explore the performance of\n\n305\n\nthe different products at specific locations that correspond to low, medium and high\n\n306\n\ncorrelations and low, medium and high vegetation density. Finally, to evaluate\n\n13\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n307\n\nperformance during extreme growing season conditions we qualitatively compare maps\n\n308\n\nof 3-monthly z-scores for a wet (2007) and dry (2009) year.\n\n309\n\n3. RESULTS\n\n310\n\nSimilar to Dorigo et al. (2014)\xe2\x80\x9fs analysis of spatial coverage (1979-2010), Figure\n\n311\n\n2 shows the temporal variability of the CCI-SM\xe2\x80\x9fs spatial coverage in East Africa (1979-\n\n312\n\n2013). We determined the fraction of spatial coverage by calculating the ratio between\n\n313\n\nthe number of grid cells reporting a valid value on a given day and the number of grid\n\n314\n\ncells that reported valid value on the day of the maximum coverage during the entire\n\n315\n\nperiod. The spatial coverage is <0.4 from 1979-1992, increases to >0.5 beginning in\n\n316\n\n1998, and reaches maximum levels in 2007 (>0.8), where it remains, with the exception\n\n317\n\nof a brief time period around 2012.\n\n318\n\nNext, we mapped the temporal coverage of CCI-SM dataset for our domain\n\n319\n\nduring the main East Africa rainy seasons, March-April-May (MAM), July-August-\n\n320\n\nSeptember (JAS), and October-November-December (OND) (Figure 3). These maps\n\n321\n\ngenerally correspond to the time series in Figure 2. Temporal coverage (estimated as\n\n322\n\nthe ratio of the number of days when a valid value was reported for a given grid cell and\n\n323\n\ntotal number of days during a season in a decade) is the lowest during 1979-1990s\n\n324\n\n(<0.3), improves to 0.5 in period 1991-2000, and improves further during the recent\n\n325\n\ndecades. We find slightly higher coverage rates over Kenya than what appear in the\n\n326\n\nglobal maps of Dorigo et al. (2014).\n\n327\n\nWhile informative, it is unclear whether the fraction of data coverage impacts\n\n328\n\noptimal data usability, i.e. balancing length of record with quality of data. We evaluate\n\n329\n\nthis by comparing average March-September z-scores of CCI-SM with CHIRPS rainfall,\n\n14\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n330\n\nGIMMS NDVI and VIC and Noah modeled soil moisture. We found unrealistically low\n\n331\n\nCCI-SM values 1986 through 1991 (Figure 4a). When we remove data before 1992 the\n\n332\n\nmagnitude of the CCI-SM anomalies is more consistent with the other products (Figure\n\n333\n\n4b). Pairwise correlations are listed in Table 2 for both 1992-2013 and 1982-2013 (in\n\n334\n\nparentheses). CCI-SM is better correlated with seasonally average modeled soil\n\n335\n\nmoisture than rainfall or NDVI, and all correlations improved with the shorter time series\n\n336\n\n(1992-present). For the remainder of the analysis we use the 1992-2013 time series.\n\n337\n\nTo explore spatial patterns in the relationship between seasonally averaged data,\n\n338\n\nwe compute pixel-wise CCI-SM correlations with Noah (Figure 5a), VIC (Figure 5b) and\n\n339\n\nNDVI (Figure 5c) over East Africa cropping zones. Within this domain, CCI-SM is best\n\n340\n\ncorrelated with modeled soil moisture and NDVI in Kenya, and the southern and eastern\n\n341\n\nextent of cropping zone in Ethiopia: Noah (R~0.6-0.8), VIC (R~0.4-0.8) and NDVI\n\n342\n\n(R~0.6) Correlations are lower in Western Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and Uganda\n\n343\n\n(R~0-0.4). We also calculate the correlations for Noah and VIC soil moisture with NDVI\n\n344\n\n(Figure 5d,e), which show similarly high correlations in the same Kenya and southern\n\n345\n\nEthiopia regions, with no significant relationship over Sudan and South Sudan. Both\n\n346\n\nLSMs displayed the same spatial pattern with VIC\xe2\x80\x9fs correlation being slightly lower.\n\n347\n\nTo examine whether and how the greenness fraction influences the agreement\n\n348\n\nbetween these datasets we looked at individual time series at three locations, shown in\n\n349\n\nFigure 6a and b, Mpala Kenya (37\xc2\xb0E, 0.3\xc2\xb0N), Tigray, Ethiopia (39\xc2\xb0E, 14\xc2\xb0N) and\n\n350\n\nIllubabor, Ethiopia (8.8\xc2\xb0N, 35.46\xc2\xb0 E).\n\n351\n352\n\nMpala, Kenya is moderately vegetated (GVF=38% vegetation cover) and here,\nCCI-SM is well correlated with both modeled soil moisture and NDVI (R>0.75). The\n\n15\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n353\n\n1992-2013 timeseries of seasonal averages from this location (Figure 7a) shows a\n\n354\n\nconsistent signal among the products. We note that NDVI at Mpala (Figure 7a) does not\n\n355\n\nshow a strong response to the wet event in 2007, which we will discuss later, but does\n\n356\n\nshow positive anomalies comparable to CCI-SM and modeled soil moisture in 1998 and\n\n357\n\n2010. We also plotted the climatological monthly mean values for each variable (Figure\n\n358\n\n7b), which showed that the CCI-SM and Noah soil moisture estimates were in-phase\n\n359\n\nand NDVI was lagged by one month. With its earlier peak, VIC appears to respond\n\n360\n\nmore quickly to the start of the March-April-May rainy season than Noah or CCI-SM.\n\n361\n\nThe Tigray Region of Northern Ethiopia is the sparsely vegetated (GVF=15%)\n\n362\n\nand here, CCI-SM is not significantly correlated with modeled soil moisture or NDVI for\n\n363\n\nthe 1992-2013 period (Figure 8a). The climatological monthly mean values for each\n\n364\n\nvariable indicate that the soil moisture estimates do not agree on the seasonal cycle\n\n365\n\nand the average NDVI lags between one and two months (Figure 8b). CCI-SM agrees\n\n366\n\nwith modeled soil moisture 2004-2011 (Figure 8a) suggesting that low microwave\n\n367\n\nsatellite coverage over this region (Figure 3) may contribute to errors 1992-2003.\n\n368\n\nIllubabor, Ethiopia (35.47\xc2\xb0E, 9.5\xc2\xb0N) has moderate to high-density vegetation\n\n369\n\n(GVF=63%). Beyond this level of vegetation density CCI-SM has been flagged and\n\n370\n\nmasked for dense vegetation. Here, CCI-SM is correlated with Noah (R=0.67) and VIC\n\n371\n\n(R=0.6), with notable disagreement in 2001 and 2002. Meanwhile NDVI does not show\n\n372\n\na relationship with either model SM or CCI-SM estimates (Figure 9a). The climatological\n\n373\n\nmonthly mean values indicate that CCI-SM and NDVI are in phase January through\n\n374\n\nMay, both lagging the models by a month (Figure 9b).\n\n16\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n375\n\nCorrelations give us an indication of how time series capture a range of\n\n376\n\nconditions. For drought monitoring and food security applications, however, it is\n\n377\n\nimportant to evaluate how products represent extremes. We compare CCI-SM to Noah-\n\n378\n\nSM and NDVI in extreme wet (2007) and dry (2009) conditions by mapping 3-month z-\n\n379\n\nscores for each product (Figures 10 and 11).\n\n380\n\nIn 2007 all products were 1 to ~2 standard deviations above average (Figure 4b).\n\n381\n\nThe EM-Disaster Database (Guha-Sapir et al., 2015) indicates severe flooding in\n\n382\n\nEthiopia during July 2007. The World Food Program also reports above average rainfall\n\n383\n\nin Northwest Kenya, including the Laikipia District where Mpala is located\n\n384\n\n(http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ena/wfp150278.pdf). In\n\n385\n\ngeneral, CCI-SM and Noah agree that April-May-June (AMJ) and July-August-\n\n386\n\nSeptember (JAS) were wetter than average. NDVI agrees with CCI-SM and Noah\n\n387\n\nduring JAS, especially in Kenya and the southern extent of the domain in Ethiopia\n\n388\n\n(Figure 10). The October-November-December (OND) conditions for all products show\n\n389\n\nconditions returning to nearly normal or dry.\n\n390\n\nIn 2009, all products were between 1.5 and 2 standard deviations below average\n\n391\n\n(Figure 4b). The disaster database confirms severe drought in Kenya and the FAO\n\n392\n\nStatistics Division (FAO STAT: http://faostat.fao.org/) confirms significant yield losses.\n\n393\n\nThe spatial patterns (Figure 11) during AMJ and JAS by CCI-SM, Noah and NDVI are\n\n394\n\nnearly identical - with strong deficits in central Kenya, central Sudan and north-central\n\n395\n\nEthiopia. All products indicate moisture increases in OND, however spatial patterns\n\n396\n\ndiverge, e.g. NDVI and CCI-SM deficits remain strong in eastern Sudan, while Noah\n\n397\n\nshows near normal conditions.\n\n17\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n398\n399\n\n4. DISCUSSION\nThe European Space Agency\xe2\x80\x9fs CCI-SM is a long term gridded soil moisture\n\n400\n\ndataset which has potential to be very valuable for long-term agricultural drought and\n\n401\n\nhydrologic extreme analysis, especially in places like East Africa that suffer from a lack\n\n402\n\nof in situ rainfall and soil moisture observations. In this study we comprehensively\n\n403\n\nevaluated this dataset over East Africa, specifically for the purposes of agricultural\n\n404\n\ndrought analysis. Results in Figures 2 and 3 demonstrate the variability of the spatial\n\n405\n\nand temporal coverage of this dataset in our focus domain and Figure 4a and b showed\n\n406\n\nhow CCI-SM compares to other independent datasets (i.e. CHIRPS rainfall, GIMMS\n\n407\n\nNDVI and modeled soil moisture) that are currently being used by the FEWS NET for\n\n408\n\nagricultural drought analysis and monitoring in this region.\n\n409\n\nMaps of our correlation analysis (Figure 5) show where CCI-SM, modeled soil\n\n410\n\nmoisture and NDVI are all reliable sources of growing season conditions in e.g. Kenya\n\n411\n\nand where CCI-SM can corroborate soil moisture estimates from the VIC and Noah\n\n412\n\nmodels, but analysts should be wary of a non-linear relationship between soil moisture\n\n413\n\nestimates and NDVI in moderate to highly vegetated locations e.g. Illubabor, Ethiopia\n\n414\n\n(Figure 9a). We also highlight where CCI-SM, NDVI and even models driven with the\n\n415\n\nsame rainfall and meteorological inputs disagree e.g. Tigray, Ethiopia. This site appears\n\n416\n\nto be the convergence of multiple sources of uncertainty \xe2\x80\x93 differences in model physics\n\n417\n\nand parameters result in low correlations between the Noah and VIC models, CCI-SM\n\n418\n\nclimatological monthly mean appears to be shifted a month earlier than Noah and two\n\n419\n\nmonths earlier than NDVI (Figure 9b). Targeted investigation on sources of model or\n\n420\n\nobservational uncertainty is needed here and in other regions, like central Sudan and\n\n18\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n421\n\nSouth Sudan, where our maps indicate no agreement between the different estimates\n\n422\n\n(Figure 5). Despite differences when considering the 1992-2013 record, Figures 10 and\n\n423\n\n11 show that there is very high and wide spread correspondence between CCI-SM and\n\n424\n\nmodeled soil moisture in wet and dry extreme years (2007, 2009). This contrasts with\n\n425\n\nNDVI, which corresponds to CCI-SM and Noah better during the dry year (Figure 11).\n\n426\n\nWhile CCI-SM and potentially other microwave products, like SMAP and SMOS,\n\n427\n\nshow great potential for FEWS NET applications in East Africa there are some caveats\n\n428\n\nto address. First, due to the relatively low spatial and temporal data coverage (and poor\n\n429\n\ndata quality during 1986 to 1992), we limited our period of analysis to 1992-2013. The\n\n430\n\ndata quality and coverage even during this time period was not always consistent.\n\n431\n\nThere were many more records available over the Sudan and Western Ethiopia than\n\n432\n\nSomalia and southeast Ethiopia and during post-2001 than the previous periods. Future\n\n433\n\nstudies targeting smaller regions within East Africa might have to adopt different\n\n434\n\nanalysis periods (e.g. Tigray). This is also true for extensions of this work that will\n\n435\n\nevaluate CCI-SM over other FEWS NET regions of interest like western, northern, and\n\n436\n\nsouthern Africa and the Middle East.\n\n437\n\nSecond, in this analysis, we limit the comparison of CCI-SM dataset to only NDVI\n\n438\n\nand modeled soil moisture datasets. For the purpose of drought impact analysis,\n\n439\n\nhowever, we need to examine the correspondence between various datasets with\n\n440\n\nmetrics such as crop yield losses (available from FAO and national agricultural\n\n441\n\nagencies), numbers of people affected and economic damages (from the EM-Dat\n\n442\n\nInternational Disaster Database). This is a daunting task, given that the influence of\n\n443\n\nnon-agro-climatic factors (e.g., livelihood and market accessibility) on those metrics and\n\n19\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n444\n\nthe general lack of high quality, long-term, sub-national data on crop area and\n\n445\n\nproduction.\n\n446\n\nFinally, demonstrating the relevance of remotely sensed and modeled for drought\n\n447\n\nimpact assessment is challenging but worthwhile task. Evaluation of remotely sensed\n\n448\n\nand modeled data sets is essential to continue to make improvements for food security\n\n449\n\ndecision support. A challenge is finding a suite of metrics that capture the value,\n\n450\n\nuncertainty, and information content of the observations while factoring in both science\n\n451\n\nand societal impacts. Kumar et al. (2014) describe decision-theory based metrics that\n\n452\n\naddress weaknesses of conventional metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) and\n\n453\n\nanomaly correlation that may not be suited for capturing impact to hydrological\n\n454\n\napplications. Ideally, these types of metrics could be used to make \xe2\x80\x9eexpert opinion\xe2\x80\x9f more\n\n455\n\ntransparent \xe2\x80\x93 e.g. what metric would show that NDVI is a good indicator of very dry\n\n456\n\nconditions, as we showed in our 2009 example? One would first need to construct an\n\n457\n\nindependent baseline of droughts to quantify the value of NDVI. Other studies, like Jia et\n\n458\n\nal. (2015); Yuan et al. (2015) used modeled and in situ data sets for this baseline, but\n\n459\n\nwhat would one use to simultaneously evaluate models and NDVI when in situ data is\n\n460\n\nnot available?\n\n461\n\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\n462\n\nAgricultural drought monitoring in data sparse regions is a challenge leaving much\n\n463\n\nroom for improvement but continues to reap benefits from advancements in remote\n\n464\n\nsensing and modeling technologies. Synthesizing soil moisture predictions from\n\n465\n\ndifferent sources of evidence (rainfall driven land surface models, remote sensing and\n\n466\n\nNDVI) represents a best guess as to how growing season conditions are progressing\n\n20\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n467\n\nand can be used to provide early warning for natural hazards like droughts and floods,\n\n468\n\nwhich are linked to food insecurity.\n\n469\n\nHere we show that the new ESA CCI-SM soil moisture product adds information to\n\n470\n\nhistorical drought analysis.\n\n471\n\nOur primary findings are:\n\n472\n\n(1) Spatial and temporal coverage of this dataset is generally poor in East Africa\n\n473\n474\n\nprior to 1992 but improves with time.\n(2) Post 1992 the correlation of CCI-SM dataset with other datasets improves, and\n\n475\n\nits correlation, with NOAH and VIC soil moisture, is statistically significant\n\n476\n\n(R>0.68).\n\n477\n\n(3) Grid-cell scale comparison of CCI-SM with VIC, NOAH and NDVI indicated that\n\n478\n\nCCI-SM generally has a higher level of agreement (R>0.5) over Kenya and\n\n479\n\ncentral Ethiopia; whereas agreement over western Ethiopia and neighboring\n\n480\n\nregions of Sudan and South Sudan is limited.\n\n481\n\n(4) Correlation maps and specific case studies show that analysts can be confident\n\n482\n\nabout the indication of growing season anomalies in much of Kenya and the\n\n483\n\nsouthern cropping extent of Ethiopia. In central Ethiopia CCI-SM can corroborate\n\n484\n\nmodeled soil moisture better than NDVI, and in northern and western Ethiopia\n\n485\n\nanalysts should be wary of all data products and consult field informants.\n\n486\n\n(5) The CCI-SM and modeled soil moisture show remarkably similar anomalies\n\n487\n\nduring extreme wet and dry years.\n\n488\n\nThese efforts are important as preparation for SMAP, SMOS and future soil moisture\n\n489\n\nmissions. The improved accuracy of future products should improve our overall\n\n21\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n490\n\nconfidence in a convergence of evidence framework and further extend this time series\n\n491\n\nfor better percentile-based estimates of drought. Despite the fact that CCI-SM data are\n\n492\n\nnot available at near real-time, these data provide important baseline, historical\n\n493\n\ninformation, hydrologic model verification and allow food security analysts to become\n\n494\n\nmore familiar with the strengths and limitations of microwave soil moisture retrievals.\n\n495\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\n496\n\nWe acknowledge the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) and the GES\n\n497\n\nDISC for the dissemination of MERRA.
