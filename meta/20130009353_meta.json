Open issues, which might affect project delivery date, have plans in place or are being created, to maintain DSS-35 Operational Date. There are no known open issues that affect performance. Overall good progress has been made in all areas (procurements, contracts, design and development) and the project is confident that DSS-35 & 36 antennas and the three 80kW Uplink systems will be delivered according to plan.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130009353, "name": "Deep Space Mission Briefing", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "0de46f01452f418a8dda99d2c2cafea4", "startDate": "2012-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009353, "id": "4f4ac76f466e41848d6e9f447178196e", "publicationDate": "2012-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
