Since such ambitious missions require technologies that exceed today's state of the art, APD established the SAT program to mature key technologies that enable these future missions, from demonstrated feasibility (i.e., Technology Readiness Level, or TRL, of 3), to the point where they can be incorporated into\nNASA flight missions (i.e., TRL 6).\n\nAPD set up three science-themed Programs, COR, ExEP, and PCOS, to address three fundamental questions: \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d (COR), \u201cAre we alone?\u201d (ExEP), and \u201cHow does the universe work?\u201d (PCOS).
