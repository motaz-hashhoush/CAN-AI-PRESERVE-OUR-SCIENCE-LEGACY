The\nKorea .Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and the IIT\nResearch Institute (IITRI) were selected as the active transfer\nagents to participate in the program. The pilot project was\nbased upon the.approach to the transfer of domestic technology\ndeveloped by the NASA Technology Utilization Division and\nutilized the extensive data and technical resources available\nthrough the Space Agency and its contractors.\nU. S. specialists assisted the Koreans in searching\nthe aerospace data banks and adapting the methodology for\nrelating the data to specific industrial problems. Korean\ntechnologists were responsible for adapting the most promising\ntechnologies to specific Korea needs, with particular emphasis\non those industrial opportunities which could generate\nemployment, develop export opportunities, and utilize\nindigenous raw materials and local skills. The study has led\nto a number of specific developments which could yield direct\neconomic benefits to Korea ten or more times the program\ninvestment during the next three years. The process of\nproblem oriented technology transfer has been validated,\nalthough some alterations in the methodology are indicated\nfor any future programs. This pilot project has also helped\nto clarify some aspects of the international technology transfer\nprocess and to upgrade Korean technological capabilities.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEA8CH INSTITUTE\n\niii\n\nMajor findings and results of the project are:\nGeneral\n1.\n\n2.\n\nAn AID input--in terms of program design and\nrelatively little financial support\xe2\x80\x94can serve as\nan important catalyst to facilitate the international\ntransfer of technology to developing nations in two\nways; first, by stimulating improved coupling between U..S; sources of technology and developing\nnation transfer agents, and, second, in improving\nrelationships between the agents and manufacturing\nfirms of the developing country.\nTransfer agents in a developing nation can\nserve a crucial role in the selection and\nadaptation of technology which individual\nfirms in the country could not duplicate in\ndealing directly with foreign industry or\nforeign transfer agents.\n\n3.\n\nIndustrial skills and resources necessary\nto implement solutions to expressed needs\nare very important to the ultimate commercialization of the technology transfer. As\nsuch, an assessment of the training, financial\nsupport and technical assistance required\nto. achieve production should be an integral\npart of the need definition/selection process.\n\n4.\n\nA significant commitment of time, effort and\nfunds by the developing nation is required\nto pursue transfers to the point of economic\nimpact.\n\nImpacts\n1.\n\nTwo Korean electronic firms are now capable\nof manufacturing more sophisticated products\nfor the domestic and government markets.\n\n2.\n\nThe concept of investment in R & D has been\nadvanced within segments of the Korean\nelectronics industry in addition to increased\nconfidence in KIST\'s ability to develop\nmarketable products and processes.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\niv\n\n3.\n\nKIST awareness of the importance of providing\ntraining for industrial manufacturing\npersonnel has been increased.\n\n4.\n\nThe project has resulted in direct Korean\nsupport for nine development projects at\nKIST.\n\n5.\n\nThe need for\' economic studies as well as\nconsideration of the licensing and capital\nrequirements associated with technology\ntransfer has become more apparent to KIST.\n\n6.\n\nThe technical competence and morale of the\nKIST staff has been increased through\nexposure to advanced technology.\n\n7.\n\nThe ability of KIST to advise upon and make\ndecisions to "buy or build" technology has\nbeen improved.\n\nMethodology\n1.\n\nThe methodology applied in the program has\nbeen successful in transferring technologies,\nboth technical and commercial, to Korea, and\nis generally applicable for continued use in\nassisting in the technical development of\nKorean industry.\n\n2.\n\nThe selection of needs to be pursued should\nbe based upon national economic plans,\nidentified industrial interest, local technical expertise and economic studies of the\nmarket and required investment. The number\nof solutions pursued should be small enough\nto permit adequate resources for each, but\nlarge enough to allow for the possibility of\ndelay and/or failure on one or more.\n\n3.\n\nWhile the NASA technology data bank contains\nmuch information related to the needs of a\ndeveloping nation, the U. S. transfer agent\nshould be familiar with and have access to\na broader data base more responsive to the\nhighest priority problems of low income\nnations.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\nV\n\n4.\n\nDirect interaction between the U. S.\ntechnologists and the participating\nspecialists is vital to achieving the\nunderstanding necessary for useful transfer.\nDialogue on a "face to face" basis is the\nbest way to overcome the barriers to\neffective technical communication and to\nrelate the new technology to the needs of\nthe developing nation.\n\n5.\n\nGiven a transfer agent in the developing\ncountry with skills and experience\ncomparable to KIST and given a major commitment\nin time and funds by the developing country,\nthe time required to begin to achieve\ncommercialization is a minimum of two years\nand more probably three to five years.\n\nBased on the results of this study, we recommend continued\nsupport of U. S. assistance to Korean technology transfer\ninitiatives as well as additional technology transfer .programs\nmodeled after this pilot project. We suggest conducting two\ntypes of programs, one program for a nation at a stage of develppment similar to that of Korea, and a second program directed\nto stimulating entrepreneurs in a country with less industrialization.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nvi\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPage\nSUMMARY .............................................iii\nI ..\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n...............\n\n......\n\n...........\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 3\n\nII .\n\nMETHODOLOGY ........................ \xe2\x80\xa2 .......... 7\n\nIII.\n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS ..... 17\nA.\n\nProgram Schedule \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 ............. ........ ... 17\n\nB.\n\nNeeds Selected for Technological Transfer-. 23\n\nC.\n\nRetrospective Critique ................ .... 34\n\nD.\n\nImpact Upon Korea .......... ........ \xe2\x80\xa2 ..... .36\n\nE .

S. Government through the Agency\nfor International Development (AID) has funded a concentrated\nprogram of assistance to underdeveloped areas of the world\nunder the Foreign Assistance Act to contribute to the social\nand economic advancement of the world\'s developing nations.\nOne of the objectives of the Office of Science and Technology of\nAID is to assist developing countries in establishing processes\nof technological transfer and adaptation. In particular, the\nstrengthening of the capabilities of local industries to make\nbetter technological choices is an important step in the overall\neconomic development of a developing nation.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nhas been actively concerned with the transfer and utilization\nof aerospace research to U. S. Industry. The NASA Technology\nUtilization Program has developed a systematic framework\nof methods and resources to promote the transfer and adaptation\nof technology. In 1968, NASA commissioned a study to assess the\napplicability of technology generated by the space program to\nthe needs of developing nations. The study concluded that\naerospace generated technology appeared applicable and transferable. Encouraged by these findings, the AID Office of Science\nand Technology invited NASA to enter into a cooperative pilot\nproject to test this conclusion.\nThe pilot project was designed to test the feasibility\nof transferring selected types of industrial technology,\ndeveloped in support of the U. S. space program, into the\nmainstream of industrial activities of a developing country.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n3\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nThe project objective was to demonstrate whether.recently\ndeveloped technology can be introduced into developing countries\nx\nin such a way as to accelerate industrial development and\nenable them to "leap frog" some intermediate development steps.\nThe institution in the developing country selected for involvement in the program was a critical part of the study design. It\nneeded to be attuned to local industrial, needs, capable of\nadapting U. S. technology to local requirements, and interested\nin establishing a continuing program of technology transfer.\nFurthermore, the participating U. S. institution required\nexperience in technology utilization as well as familiarity\nwith and access to NASA and other technology resources.\nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) was selected by AID as the\ndeveloping country to participate in this pilot project\nbecause:\n1.\n\nThe ROK has a high interest in increased\nindustrialization.\n\n2-\n\nA comprehensive national plan for achieving\nincreased industrialization exists.\n\n3.\n\nThe Korea Institute of Science and Technology\n(KIST) has the requisite background and interest\nin technological assistance to industry.\n\nKorean industry is labor intensive and, in many cases, based on\nforeign technology components and processes. The growth of\nforeign investments and loans has spiralled since the enactment\nof the Korean Foreign Capital Inducement Law in 1962. (Appendix\nI presents data on the growth and status of the Korean economy.)\nI.\n\nThe Third Five-Year Economic Plan (1972-1976),\nGovernment of Korea, Seoul, 1971.\nNT\n\nR E S E A R C H INSTITUTE\n\n4\n\nIn recent years, the government of Korea has been systematically developing institutions to support the expanding"\nindustrial economy. KIST, founded in 1966 with aid from\nthe U. S. Government, is a not-for-profit organization that\ncarries out research and development for Korean industry and\n.government. By .providing excellent facilities and working\nconditions, KIST has been able to recruit an unusually\ncompetent staff to conduct scientific research, technical and\nengineering investigations, and economic analyses. Through\nits reservoir of scientific talent, KIST provides technical\nsupport for Korea\'s industrial expansion, and is becoming\nfinancially self-sufficient as evidenced by the 143 projects\nconducted in 1972. Research is carried out in many diverse\nindustrial areas including electrical equipment, metals, food\nprocessing, and non-electrical machinery. In summary, KIST\nhad demonstrated that it can contribute substantially to\nKorea\'s industrial progress.\nIIT Research Institute (IITRI) was selected as U. S.\nparticipant on the basis of its more than ten years experience\nas a consulting contractor to the NASA Office of Technology\nUtilization and on the basis of the many areas of technical\nexpertise covered by the IITRI staff. Directly applicable\nexperience included the Institute\'s ongoing participation in\nNASA\'s program of Technology Applications Teams. These teams\nare engaged in the identification of needs in the public and\nprivate sectors, restatement of specific needs in technological\nterms and the location of technologies relevant to the\nfulfillment of the needs.\nThe pilot project was initiated in June, 1970 following\na preliminary trip to South Korea to visit typical industries\nand to establish the project outline in conjunction with the\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n5\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nKIST participants. This report reviews the technology transfer\nmethodology which was initiated along with the evolutionary\nchanges in methods which took place as the project progressed.\nThe project implementation and accomplishments are detailed\nwith discussions of each transfer activity. While there was\na unifying technical theme, the electronics industry, each\ntransfer attempt provided different learnings and accomplishments.\nThe report presents a retrospective critique of the pilot project\nand attempts to relate these findings to other developing\ncountries, although it is recognized that each country will have\nrequirements peculiar to its needs and capabilities . Technology\ntransfer to the ultimate stage of commercial application is a\nslow process and niost of the individual transfers had not\nreached the final stage at the end of 1972. Nonetheless, this\nreport summarizes the impacts (real and potential) which have\naccrued as a result of the pilot project together with the\nkey learnings that have been achieved. Efforts, past and\nfuture, to disseminate the results of the project are briefly\nreviewed in the context of possible adaptation of the same or\nsimilar technology transfer activities by other countries.\nFinally, recommendations for related technology transfer activities\nare made.\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe two individual words, technology and.transfer,\nhave fairly precise and well understood meanings; technology-the application of science, especially in industry or commerce;\ntransfer \xe2\x80\x94 to convey, shift, or change from one person or\nplace to another. 2 However, when the words technology transfer\nare used in combination to connote a process or method, the\nterm is ambiguous. Technology may be transferred in many ways.\nEducation, dissemination of publications, mobility of\nknowledgeable people are but a few of the widely recognized\nways in which \'the application of science is conveyed from\none place to another\'. Thus a particular definition of\ntechnology transfer as it applies to this project is in\norder.\nThe pilot project employed a specific technology\ntransfer method consisting of six discrete (albeit sometimes\niterative) steps.\n\n1.\n2.\n\nAn Organized Search for Potentially Relevant\nAerospace Technology.\n\n3.\n\n2.\n\nIdentification and Restatement of Korean Needs,\n\nEvaluation and Selection of Possible Solutions\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,\nAmerican Heritage Publishing Co., 1969\n\nIIT RESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n4.\n\nFollow-up to Obtain Technological Details .\n\n5.\n\nApplications Engineering to Adapt the Technology\nto Local Needs.\n\n6.\n\nIndustrial Utilization.\n\nThe method is illustrated as a flow chart in Figure 1.\nThis approach was predicated upon the nature of the\naerospace data bank and most other sources of U. S. technology.\nThat is, the bulk of the technological literature describes\nan incremental improvement such as a modified material,\nprocess step, circuit design, new component, etc. Only\ninfrequently is a new device (product), a total process,\nor a complete technology accessible from a discrete reference\nor single source. This is not surprising since much of our\ntechnological progress is achieved through a multiplicity\n3\nof incremental advances.\nHowever, the incremental approach\nproved to be an impediment to the location of technological\nsolutions to Korean needs and will be discussed in more\ndetail in Chapter III, Project Implementation.\nThe initial (and very critical) step in the methodology\nwas the identification by KIST, of needs which had potential\neconomic benefit and which were amenable to technological\nsolutions. This was accomplished through knowledge of the\nareas of emphasis in the Third Five-Year Economic Plan and by\ncontact with industry and government representatives. The\nresult was a large and heterogeneous group of needs ranging\nfrom improved food packaging for military rations to a new\n3.\n\ncf. - Myers and Marquis, Successful Industrial Innovations,\nNSF 69-17.\nIIT R E S E A R C H I N S T I T U T E\n\n8\n\nEXTERNAL\nTECHNOLOGY\nSOURCES\n\nIITRI\n\nK.

It was then necessary to translate the\nbasic need into technical terms-so that a search for potential\nsolutions could be undertaken through computer data banks and\npersonal contact with experts in the appropriate technical\nareas. This part of step one was undertaken by the team of\nfive KIST scientists while in residence at IITRI. Interaction\nX\nwith the staff of IITRI as well as computer search experts\nensured that technical and semantic usages were correct.\nSince the actual process of translation is difficult, and a\nlucid explanation of the process is even more difficult, we\npresent the following example to illustrate the process.\nNeed -- A means to reduce or eliminate carbon\nmonoxide poisoning which results from the burning\nof large, formed briquets" of charcoal in unvented\nfloor furnaces in the Ondol room of Korean homes.\nThe large number of existing dwellings precludes\nalterations in the house or furnace since these\nwould represent a major economic investment.\nTranslation -- Find an inexpensive and reliable\nmonitor for carbon monixide concentration;\nfind an inexpensive additive which will chemically\nor catalytically convert carbon monoxide to a\nnon-toxic form without significantly reducing\nthe energy content of the briquet; find an\ninexpensive substance which will absorb large\namounts of carbon monoxide before requiring\nreplacement and an indicator to signal the end\nof useful performance; etc.\nClearly a variety of technologies might provide a useful\nsolution. In some cases the initial need was so broad in\ncharacter that the technological translation created what\namounted to a long list of sub-needs, each of which was a\npotential technology transfer in and of itself. Resource\nlimitations dictated the elimination of such items from\nconsideration in the pilot project. However, subsequent\n\nIIT\n\nRESIARCH\n\n1\n1\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nlearnings suggest that an attempt should be made to approach\nbroad needs on a segmented basis to see if this is a viable\napproach since many of the pressing needs of a nation with\na limited technological base are broad in nature.\nStep two in methodology consisted of identifying\ntechnologies related to the needs and retrieving sufficient\ninformation to be able to evaluate the applicability of the\ntechnology. Several parallel approaches to technology\nidentification were employed. Key words and descriptions\nwere taken from the technical version of the need statement\nand used to make a computer search of the NASA data bank\nand other technological information resources. Additional\ninformation on U. S. data banks is contained in Appendix II.\nThese searches were made by the Aerospace Research Applications\nCenter (ARAC). ARAC, run by the Indiana University Foundation,\nis a facility established by NASA which provides data search\nand information retrieval services to clients on a fee basis.\nIITRI knowledge of activities at the NASA centers formed, the\nbasis for phone and letter contact with NASA scientists and\nengineers working in related technical areas. In addition,\ncontact was made with firms, universities and laboratories\nknown to be engaged in relevant research and development. As\na result of these searches, literally hundreds of documents\nand informational inputs were obtained. A preliminary screening\nwas sufficient to reveal that much of the technology retrieved\nby the broad based search was not suitable and that some needs\nelicited no potentially interesting solutions. However, over\none third of the needs resulted in interesting technology\nrequiring further evaluation.\nThe detailed evaluation of the pertinent technical\ninformation and the selection of opportunities to be pursued\nin depth was carried out by KIST management and staff upon the\nIIT\n\nR E S E A R C H INSTITUTE\n\n12\n\nreturn to KIST of the Korean project team. This third step,\nevaluation and selection, led to the identification of four\nproblems which appeared to meet the major criteria established:\na\n\na.\n\nRelevant U. S. technology existed and was\naccessible.\n\nb.\n\nThe potential economic impact was significant.\n\nc.\n\nAn industrial user had been identified.\n\nd.\n\nKIST had the technical skills necessary for\nadaptive engineering.\n\ne.\n\nThe resources (KIST time and funds)\nnecessary to pursue the transfer were\nwithin the budgetary allocations.\n\nSome of the reasons for the final selection are discussed in the\nKIST Final Project Report.4The technical information which formed the basis for\nevaluation and selection was in the form of reports and notes\nof initial conversations with U. S. scientists and engineers.\nEffective transfer of technology requires a much greater\ndetail of information sometimes including components, test data,\nconstruction specifications, etc. The requirements vary with\nthe technology and the application, but it is uniformly agreed\nthat by far the best mechanism to acquire such information\nis personal discussion between the original innovator(s) and\n\n4.\n\nAID/NASA Pilot Project for Technology Transfer to a\nDeveloping Nation -- Republic of Korea, KIST, Seoul,\nKorea, June, 1972, page 5.\nIll\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n13\n\nthe specialist who will perform the adaptation and implementation of the technology. Thus, the fourth step in this\nparticular technology transfer method, the acquisition of\nspecific detailed information, was accomplished through\nvisits to the U. S. by the four KIST engineers assigned to\npursue each of the selected transfers. The visits, which\nranged from two to four weeks in duration, entailed trips\nby the KIST specialist and an IITRI team member to the various\nlaboratories and firms having the desired expertise. These\ntrips were interspersed with periods of review and evaluation\nto ascertain the degree of completeness of the information\nand, where necessary, to establish requirements for inputs\non related technology which would be needed to support the\ntransfer.\n.\nUpon return to Korea, each engineer initiated efforts\nto develop prototype devices which embodied the technologies\nthat had been obtained. The adaptive engineering, step five,\nwas planned and executed entirely by the management and staff\nof KIST. Schedules and proposed accomplishments were forwarded to IITRI for review and approval by cognizant NASA\nand AID staff. During this period there were occasional\nrequests to IITRI for supplementary information or special\nmaterials and/or components, but basically KIST was responsible\nfor this very important link in the transfer chain. The final\nobjective was to construct working prototypes which exhibited\nthe characteristics and performance felt to be necessary for\nsuccessful Korean utilization.\nThe sixth and final step of the technology transfer\nprocess was the manufacture (and sale) or use of the end\nitem. In concept and in practice this involved a variety\nof interactions between KIST and Korean industry. Where a\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n14\n\nsimilar or related product was already being manufactured\n(assembled), it was still essential to provide on-the-job\ntraining for industry employees. This was necessary to\ntransfer the production skills required to maintain end\nitem performance in a manufacturing environment. In the\ncase where a very significant change in manufacturing processes was involved, it was incumbent upon KIST to prove\nnot only that the required skills and technology were\navailable in Korea but also that the start up and production\ncosts were economically justified by the then existing\nmarket size. The transition from the prototype stage to\ncommercial production has always been a difficult step in\nthe innovation process and. this pilot project has not proven\nto be an exception to the rule.\n\nOne can see that the methods rely heavily on the total\ninvolvement and commitment of the foreign participants to\nsolve their own problems. The project utilized discreet needs\nand technologies to meet the objective of examining the\nrelevancy of aerospace technology and testing a structured\ntransfer methodology. In addition, the project was aimed at\nthe establishment of procedures to provide a tool - a technical\ninformation resource - which would open up selected sectors of\nU. S. technical data banks to the participants so that they\nmight tap them and adapt the findings for their own use.\n\nNT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n15\n\nIII.\n\nPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n<\n\nThe pilot project participants established a set of\ngoals in support of the primary objective of demonstrating\nwhether recently developed technology can be introduced into\ndeveloping countries in such a way as to accelerate industrial\ndevelopment. These goals were as follows:\n1.\n\nTrain Korean personnel in the specific transfer\nmethods and technology resources to be used in\nthe project.\n\n2.\n\nAchieve specific transfers of technology which\nresult in economic and social advantage.\n\n3.\n\nEvaluate the techniques used with Korea and assess\ntheir general applicability to other developing\nnations.\n\n4.\n\nRecommend a revised training and implementation\nplan based on lessons learned.\n\n5.\n\nDisseminate relevant information on the program\nmethodology and results to other developing nations\n\nA.\n\nPROGRAM SCHEDULE\n\nIn order to accomplish the goals of the program, the\nphasing and timing of activities was developed as shown in\nFigure 2. Phase I consisted of a technical mission visit to\nthe Republic of Korea and KIST by representatives of AID,\nNASA, IITRI, and ARAC (Appendix III).\nAt the conclusion\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n17\n\nto\n\n1\n\n\\\n\n^\n\nCVI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSI\n\n0)\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nO\nt"-\n\nc\no\n\ni\n\nM\n\nO\n\n\' .\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 . . \' . \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nn\no>\xe2\x80\x94\n\n5^\n\n.S o\n.So\no g\n\ni. a\nK-OT\n\ngis\n5^\xc2\xbb\n\xc2\xab oe\n\nH U.UI\n\n18\n\n-\n\ncn\n<\nX\na.\n2\n<\no:\no\no\no:\n\nCO\nLJ\n\no:\nID\n\nE o\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\nc\no\n\nl\xc2\xab\nit 3\n10\n\noc\n~ o\no\n>\n\n.c\na.\n\n\' : Z\n\n_i\n<\nt\nz\n\n"s\nsi\na>\nw\no\n\no\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCL\n\nw.2\n\no o\n\nH\no>\n\n.\n\n*. 01\nOflC\n\ni\n\nQ\nZ\n<\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 V\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .-\n\nO\nZ--\n\n.\'\xe2\x80\xa2,.\'\'.\'\xe2\x80\xa2 :s\nh-\n\n"\' \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \' " \'\n\nc\no\n\n*<o\nn\n\n.y 2\nc o\n\nY/////////A\n\nCVJ\n\n. . - -\n\nP\nO O\n\n> a>\nU QC\n\na>\n\n.5?\n\nII\n\nof Phase I, KIST management proposed a group of senior staff\nmembers as candidates for the project team and the five KIST\nstaff finally selected possessed extensive technical experience\nand had bilingual capability (Appendix III). A list of\ntechnical needs prepared by KIST in preparation for this visit\nwas briefly reviewed and formed the start of the set of needs\nexamined for relevant technology in Phase II.\nPhase II involved a trip to the U.S. by the KIST Project Team. It was a working indoctrination session to\ninstruct the participants on the operation of NASA\'s Technology Utilization Program and included methods of transferring technology, processing of an initial number of Korean\nneeds and performing preliminary follow-up information\ngathering efforts. Based on this visit, the KIST Team returned to Korea to identify additional suitable industrial\nneeds for pursuit in the program, to select items for indepth effort to perform necessary applications engineering,\nand to assist in introducing the technology to Korean industry.\nThe KIST Team was in the U.S. for 37 regular working\ndays and completed the following tasks:\n50 needs were defined and processed.\n60 separate literature searches were performed\nand submitted to the Team.\nRelevant technology was identified for 13 of the\n50 needs.\nKIST spent 4 days on site at ARAC to learn\ncomputer search techniques.\nThe Koreans prepared 29 computer search strategies.\nTwo NASA Field Centers were visited by the Koreans.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n19\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nThe Team made 26 industrial contacts related\nto the problems defined in Phase II.\nThe KIST Team toured an industrial technical\nResearch Center to see how the services of a\nregional dissemination center were used in\nindustry.\nPresentations were made to the KIST Team on four\nareas of technology transfer by four specialists\nin the field.\nPhase III began after the departure of the KIST Team\nfor Korea in October of 1970. While Phases I and II laid\nthe ground-work and provided relevant background material,\nPhase III was devoted to doing the actual work of effecting\ntechnology transfers and in terms of the total time for the\nprogram, represented the major portion of the study. Although the team returned to Korea in October, it was several\nmonths before they could devote any significant time to the\nprogram due to the pressures related to responsibilities of\ntheir respective functions at KIST. Time then had to be\ndevoted by KIST to studying the results of Phase II evaluations and to selecting items for detailed follow-up in the\nUnited States.\nIn Phase III, three additional KIST staff became\ninvolved in the program because their technical backgrounds\nwere relevant to specific problems being pursued. The\ninvolvement of new staff members had the benefit of broadening\nthe KIST exposure to the technology transfer mechanisms.\nDuring the first half of 1971, four KIST researchers spent a\n. total of four man months in the U. S. working with IITRI\npersonnel on the selected problems. Forty-four organizations\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n20\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nwere contacted in the course of the visits including NASA\nfield installations, NASA contractors, private industries,\nindustry associations, and other U.S. Government agencies.\nDuring the visits, the Korean researchers obtained extensive data for each of their technical needs relative to\nsuch factors as design, applications, commercial equipment,\nmanufacturing considerations, cost information, etc.\nAt this point in the project it became apparent that\nsignificant slippage in the schedule had begun to take place.\nThe project was initially programmed for 18 months but by\nMay 1971 it had just been possible to acquire the detailed\ntechnology required to satisfy the selected needs. It was\nclear that the six months remaining until the scheduled\nevaluation and reporting period was not adequate time in\nwhich to assimilate the technology, to perform adaptive\nengineering and to initiate commercialization.\nCoincidentally,\nsome questions had arisen among the U.S. participants concerning the focus on electronics which had become apparent\nin the selection of the in-depth studies. As a result, an\ninterim evaluation meeting was held in the U.S. with participation by .KIST management. Dr. Hyung Sup Choi, at that time\nKIST president and currently Minister of Science and Technology,\nDr. Yoon, KIST project leader, and Mr. Kim, a representative\nof the Ministry of Science and Technology, participated. Dr.\nChoi had played an active role in the project since its\ninception through his assistance in choosing the KIST Team,\nhelp in identifying and selecting the Korean technical needs\nfor study, and in his overall support for the KIST project\ninvolvement. This meeting reviewed the progress to date,\nthe rationale for the selection of in-depth transfers, and\nproduced an agreement to extend the project duration by. six\nmonths to June 30, 1972.\n\nIT R E S E A R C H\n21\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nThe Phase IV evaluation was initiated in April 1972\nwith a ten day site visit to Korea by representatives from\nAID, NASA and IITRI (Appendix III). During the evaluation\ntrip, discussions were held with each of the KIST principal\ninvestigators concerning the progress to date. In those\ncases where commercialization had begun, the U.S. team\nvisited the Korean firms involved and discussed the factors\ninvolved in acceptance (or rejection) of the technology with\ncompany management. The entire.program was then reviewed\nand critiqued with KIST management. The review assessed the\nimpacts on KIST, Korean industry and the economy, and analyzed\nthe project from the viewpoint of design and procedures.\nThe fifth and final phase of the project is still in\nprogress. Dissemination of the pilot project findings is\nproceeding along two lines. Seminars are being held for\nother developing countries to describe this and other\ntechnology transfer programs. The format of the seminar\nincludes opportunities for the participants to describe\ntheir needs, experiences and reactions to the methodology.\nThe first of two seminars was planned during the evaluation\nvisit to Korea and was held at KIST in November 1972. There\nwere 11 participants from six Southeast Asian nations as well\nas observers from four international organizations. The\nseminar is the subject of a separate report.\nA second\nseminar for Latin American participants is in the planning\nstage and is scheduled to be held in 1973. In addition to\nthe seminars, talks and papers describing the pilot project\nhave been presented to a number of interested groups and\ndelegations.\n\n5.\n\nAn International Seminar on Dissemination of Technology:\nThe KIST Pilot Project, IITRI report in publication.\n\nIll\n\nRESEARCH\n\n22\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nB.\n\nNEEDS SELECTED FOR TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFER\n\nThe resources of the program were limited, and only\na few needs could be selected for detailed follow-up and\nimplementation efforts. Those that were finally chosen by\nKIST had common characteristics; all dealt with electronic\ntechnology and they all required some amount of commercial\ntechnology in addition to ^hat available through the aerospace data bank to effect a complete solution. KIST made\nthe decision to devote their efforts to electronic technology\nfor the following reasons:\n.\n1.\n\nConcentration of resources on a single industry\nwould insure technology transfers which could be\nused to demonstrate the success of the transfer\nconcept to other Korean industries.\n\n2.\n\nThe Korean electronics industry was reasonably\nwell advanced and was being promoted in current\ngovernmental plans which would obviously facilitate transfer activities.\n\n3.\n\nTechnology, both aerospace and commercial,\napplicable to electronics problems was readily\nlocated during the Phase II activities.\n\nFour major electronic need areas were chosen for\napplication and transfer to Korean industry. As the project\nevolved in Phase III, two of the areas subdivided into a\nnumber of closely related applications. Interrelationships\nbetween the technologies also became apparent and some prototype devices ultimately utilized several technologies .\noriginally considered to be discrete items.\n\n11T\n\nRESEARCH\n23\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nKorea is both a producer and consumer of a wide range\nof electronic devices. They assemble and manufacture radios,\nwalkie-talkies, telephone central office equipment, television sets, etc., but rely heavily upon imported components\nand designs for their production. The private and government\npurchase of electronic equipment has kept pace with the\ngrowing Korean economy but domestically produced products\nhave not always successfully competed with imports either\nin price or quality. Also, recent changes in the military\naid provided to the ROK by the U.S. have served to stimulate\nthe domestic supply requirements of the defense sector of\nthe Korean government. Thus there are a number of ways in\nwhich electronic technology can impact industry and the\nKorean economy. The value added to export items assembled\nin Korea can be increased through component import substitutions and through improved design (performance) reflected\nin increased sale price. The share of the domestic market\ncan be increased through cost reductions and/or increased\nperformance, and, similarly, direct export markets can be\nopened if the product is sufficiently improved and can be\nmanufactured locally.\nMiniaturized Radio Transceivers\nDomestic Korean consumption of transceivers of this\ntype was estimated at 20,000 units or $800,000 in sales by\n1974. KIST also anticipates an export market to develop\nwithin the United States if the Federal Communication\nCommission will allocate the 49 MHz band for citizen use.\nThe estimated U. S. market demand for transceivers\nsimilar to Korean design is approximately 3 million units.\nHowever, there is only a 20 percent probability of a U. S.\nexport market developing for this product. The technological\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n24\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nneed which this potential export market creates ;is a smaller\nsize unit with reduced power drain. However, the size of\ntransceivers for domestic use is restricted to larger units\nbecause of security regulations.\n.\nHan-Jin Electronics Company was interested in\ndeveloping a miniature unit which could be housed in the\nstandard size Korean case without sacrificing performance\nand which could be used in a small case for future export.\nHan-Jin sponsored the applications engineering necessary to\ndesign and construct a miniaturized radio transceiver employing several technologies which had been found in phase II\nof the pilot project.\n.\nA mixture of levels of sophistication was determined\nto be the best approach for Korea. This decision was based\nupon the current manufacturing skills as well as the availability and cost of components. Thus the final device\nemployed discrete components, hybrid circuits (a combination\nof thin or thick film and integrated circuits), and advanced\ncircuit designs for low power drain amplifiers. This device\nand the other transfers are discussed in more detail in\nAppendix IV. Production of units for the domestic market was\nbeing initiated at the time of the evaluation trip in May 1972\nThe Korean army is .presently using vacuum tube designs\nfor their transceivers. The Korean Ministry of Science and\nTechnology sponsored a two phase applications engineering\nprogram. Phase one was to develop a miniaturized transceiver\nto fit in the existing case which would allow additional battery capacity. This will result in increased operational\nrange and lifetime. This design has been completed and the\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n25\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nOriental Precision Company has manufactured approximately\n15 experimental units. The army is planning to conduct\nfield and environmental testing of these units. Army certification would be expected to lead to a production contract.\nPhase two involved the design and development of a completely\nminiaturized unit. Present practice has the receiver separate\nfrom the transmitter and clipped to the soldiers helmet. The\nbulk and weight of the transmitter requires hand held operation.\nKIST has completed a prototype unit which is greatly miniaturized\nand which allows both receiver and transmitter to be combined\nin a single unit attached to a helmet. Commercialization of\nthis second design awaits the results of army tests on the\nphase one unit.\nA third application of the miniature transceiver\ntechnology is for pocket paging devices and citizen alarm\ndevices. The Korean Ministry of Communications was interested\nin the development of this class of instruments. The paging\nunit is a receiver which responds to a signal from a central\nlocation and audibly notifies the wearer to call or contact\n"central". The citizen alarm is a two tone transmitter which\ncan send either of two signals to a central station to indicate\npersonal danger, a disaster or other prearranged code. A\nprototype device was constructed on the basis of circuit\ndesign information provided by Bell Labs and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Any decision on commercialization (Gold\nStar Electronics Co.) awaits further technical development\' and\nincreased market potential.\n\'\'\n\n-\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\n\'.\n\nHigh Sensitivity Receivers (Transceivers)\nOne of the innovations produced by aerospace research\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n26\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nhas been phase-lock-loop circuitry. An oversimplified\ndescription of the technology is that it uses a set of\nvery stable frequency (phase) standards or "locks" to\ncompare with incoming signals. The technique permits the\n:>\ndiscrimination or detection of desired signals in the\npresence of noise. In other words, weak signals may be\nmore easily received. The phase-lock-loop system has\ndirect application to FM radio and television reception.\nBoth urban areas and mountainous rural areas such as found\nin Korea have a limited signal reception range because the\nsignal is attenuated or distorted by physical obstructions.\nThe addition of phase-lock-loop circuitry to a radio\nor television set represents a very small fraction of the\ntotal cost but may add disproportionately to the value. The\ntotal Korean demand for radios and television is forecast\nas growing rapidly. Figure 3 presents market estimates\nprepared by the Korean Economic Planning Board.\nKIST has developed an improved tuning system for FM\nradios and television sets using phase-lock-loop technology.\nPrototype devices embodying this system have been built and\ndemonstrated to have much higher sensitivity. Current\nefforts are directed to establishing lower cost approaches.\nIf KIST succeeds in their attempt to demonstrate economically\nsatisfactory manufacturing methods, there will be the opportunity to participate in the large domestic market\nindicated in Figure 3. The television application is new\neven in developed countries and export potential is also a\npossibility.\nThe same technology has been applied to television\nrepeater stations. The number of such stations required to\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n27\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n__\n\n"\nvO\nr-.\nr-l\n\n4->\nC\n\n6\n\nS~\xc2\xa3\n\nVO\n\nd\n\nr-l\n\ni\n\n0\n\nOO\n\nB-5\nCM\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n!\n\nCM\n\ncu\nex*\n\nB-S\n\nr-4\n^\xe2\x80\x94s\n\nCJ\n\nCM\n\nO\n\nU-J\nO\n\ng\n\ncu\n\nON\nr-l\n\no\n\nin\n.\nO\n\nf^.\n\nC\n\nB-S\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nr**\xc2\xbb\n\n.\n\nr-4\n\n^\n\nW\n0)\n\n1.\n^\nON\nr-4\n\nO\n\nC\n\no\n&\no\n\n!\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2i-l\n}_l\n4J\n\nVD\n\nf^.\n\nO\n\nON\n\nCU\n\nW\n\ni\n\nS\nQ\n\nvO\n\nC\n0\n\nr-l\n\nB^S\n\n6^~\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nm\n\ng^2\n\ngs2\n\np-i\n\nr-4\nC\\J\n\nO\nO\n\ncn\n\nI\xe2\x80\x941\n\n*T-\\\n\nT3\n\na\n\nC\n\n\'.\n\nH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-l CO^\n\n4J\n\nU-)\nO\n\nO\n3\n\n4-1\n\nr-4 CU\nr-l 4->\n\xe2\x80\xa2i-T CO\nJQ W\n\nCU\n\n0\n\n0 Q\nH\n\nCU\n\n.0\n\ng-5\n\xc2\xab^f\n\nON\n\nCO\n\nr--\n\nPH\n\nO\nCO ^\nCO CU\n\ncu\n\n*O 4-1\nCU C\n4J CU\n\' CO r-l\nK CO\n\xe2\x80\xa2-I >\n\n4-) -i-l\nco 3\n\nC\n\nO\n\nr^\xc2\xbb\nON\n\n*H\nr-(\nr-4\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nen\n\nm\nr-\n\nr-l\n\nCM\n\ncu cr\n\nON\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94 4\n\nin\n\nvO\n\ncu\n\n00\n\nI\xe2\x80\x94"1\n\n</}-\n\nN^\n\xe2\x80\xa2CO-\n\n*\xc2\xb0 T3\nCO C\nCO\n\nS\n\nC\n\nO CO\n\xe2\x80\xa2H }-(\nr-l CO\nr-l r-4\n\xe2\x80\xa2r-l i-l\n.0 O\nC\n0\n\nO\n\n!"\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xbb\n\n*i-i\n\nON\nr-l\n\nr-l\nr-l\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nS,\n\nDi\nO\nH-)\n\n<\n\nr-4\n\nr-l\n\nO\nS-l\n\nvO\n\nw\nhJ\nw\n\nCO CU\n\xe2\x80\xa2 M\n0 C\nr-l CO\n\n6^2\nO\nO\n\nB-S\nVO\nvO\n\ni\n\nCJ\n\n:\n\nO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2S\n03\nO\n\nr^on\n\n1\n\na\n<^\n^\ntj~\nw\n\n\xc2\xab0\nO\ncq\n\n2i\n\nC\nG\n\n^\n\n"^4\n(jj\n\n^3\n\nO\n\nCO\n\nM\n\nco CU\n\xc2\xa3 \xe2\x80\xa2*-*\n\npL|\n\np j\n\n4J\n0\n\nO\n\n^\n"O\n0\n\ncu\n\ne\n\no\nG\no\nCJ\n\nW\n\nC\n\nco\nCU\n\nO\n\ncr\xc2\xab a,\n\nCO\n\nCU\n0\n\nr-l .

A\nsignificant increase in the range of repeater stations\ncould reduce the number of stations required and it has\nbeen estimated that this application of phase-lock-loop\ntechniques could realize a $600,000 import savings. KIST\ndesigns should be completed in 1973 and the Han-Jin Electronics Company has expressed interest in manufacturing and\nmarketing these repeater stations if the designs prove\nsatisfactory.\nKIST has also been funded by the Korean government\nto develop a design for mobile transceivers which would be\nproduced domestically rather than imported as is presently\nthe case. A device in the 450-MHz range operating at 12\nvolts, incorporating micro-miniature integrated circuits\nand utilizing phase-locked-loop techniques for improved\nsensitivity, should be completed and ready for transfer\nsometime in 1973. An estimated $500,000 in import savings\ncould be achieved in this way. Closely related are KIST\nefforts to develop a military transceiver with a larger\nnumber of usable channels. The electronic "clock" (digital\nfrequency synthesizer) replaces the crystal oscillator now\nused with a gain in stability and ease of frequency change\nwhich makes possible a larger number of discrete channels.\nLaboratory units have been constructed and are undergoing\ntest. No plans for commercialization have been made pending\nthe outcome of these initial studies.\nInductorless Circuit Technology\nThe previous technology transfer examples have\nhighlighted the Korean need for technology and skills in\nelectronic miniaturization to aid in increasing their share\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n29\n\nof the rapidly growing markets for electronic devices. In\nspite of the many advances that have been made in miniaturizing\nelectronic circuits, until now, inductors have been a\nlimiting constraint on further size reduction for most\napplications. Electrical inductors have relied upon iron\nor ferrite (a magnetic ceramic) cores to achieve the\ndesired electrical properties. As a consequence, inductors\nrepresent a significant fraction of the bulk, weight, and\ncost of modern electronic devices.\nWork performed at Goddard Space Flight Center and by\naerospace contractors had developed the beginnings of an\ninductorless circuit technology based upon the characteristics\nof solid state circuit elements (see Appendix IV). Although\nlaboratory data obtained in the U. S. was not totally\nsatisfactory, it was decided to pursue this technology since\nsuccess would represent a major technological advance and\nbe a positive contributor to the other miniaturization\nprojects. The Koreans were able to develop an approach which\nmakes inductorless circuits less sensitive to temperature\nand practical for use outside of the laboratory. Design and\nconstruction of prototype miniature FM receivers of 50, 150,\nand 450-MHz have been successfully completed; however,\npractical industrial products are still 1 to 2 years away.\n\n(IT R E S E A R C H I N S T I T U T E\n\n30\n\nTantalum Capacitors\nElectrolytic capacitors made with sintered tantalum\nhave larger capacitance per unit volume, a low power factor,\nno requirement for hermetic sealing and improved temperature\ncharacteristics as compared with conventional electrolytic\ncapacitors. As a result, tantalum capacitors are being\nspecified in an increasing array of electronic applications.\nKorea presently imports all tantalum capacitors used in the\nassembly and manufacture of electronic devices and has the\nneed to acquire the manufacturing technology.\nKIST has performed a brief survey and analysis of the\ndomestic Korean market. They conclude that a major demand\nfor tantalum capacitors will be in the production of\nelectronic calculators and military communication equipment.\nThe Min-Sung Electronics Co., Tai-Han Electric Co., and\nDong-Nam Electronics Co. are all preparing to enter the\nelectronic calculator market and will be producing about\n210,000 calculators per year. These products will require\napproximately 900,000 tantalum capacitors yearly. The\nrequirements of the military for tan-talum capacitors in\ntheir equipment is estimated at 150,000 units annually.\nAdditional requirements in other industrial and consumer\nproducts such as radios, transceivers, TV sets and instrumentation are expected to enlarge this market to about $1,000,000\n.in sales over the next several years.\nThrough detailed literature searches, visits to\nleading ,U. S. companies and discussions with laboratory\nscientists working on tantalum capacitors, an overview of\nthe technology was obtained. The proprietary nature of\nspecific manufacturing procedures restricted the information\navailable to KIST and led to the establishment of a laboratory\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n31\n\nprogram to develop the details of the three major process\nsteps.; sintering of tantalum powder, anodization of the\nsintered pellets and the pyrolysis of impregnated pellets.\nKIST has succeeded in producing high quality^capacitors in\nthe laboratory but needs to pursue the development further\'\nto perfect the process for economic high volume\' production;\nThree Korean companies have expressed a desire to\nmanufacture tantalum capacitors but indicate that the market\nshould be at least $1,000,000 to justify the capital\ninvestment and start up costs. Commercialization will\nbe contingent upon further economic feasibility studies.\nOther Transfer Activities\nIn addition to the four needs pursued in depth,\nseveral other needs for which relevant technology was\nidentified in Phase II were carried beyond the initial\nscreening. These five items are briefly reported here.\nDuring Phase II the KIST team obtained data on the\nconstruction and operation of a weather satellite picture\nreceiving station which would be a substantial improvement\nover the system in use by the Korean Office of Central\nMeteorology. The purchase price for such a system is\napproximately $11,000 and KIST initially decided to build\n:\nthe receiving station to reduce expenditures.\n\'\nDiscussions with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nduring Phase III visits emphasized the problems associated\'\nwith the construction of a reliable unit. As a result,\nKIST altered its decision and has purchased ah initial \'\nsystem from EMR Aerospace Sciences Corporation, a NASA\nlicensee. Using the experience gained with the purchased\nequipment, KIST plans to construct a second system incorporating\n(IT R E S E A R C H I N S T I T U T E\n\n32\n\ninduetorless circuits and other advances developed under the\npilot program. The experience gained in arriving at the\ndifficult "build or buy" decision has been a valuable product\nof the program.\nThere is a need to develop a replacement for the\ntinplate can used for food packaging in Korea since tinplate\nis expensive and is not produced domestically. The Phase\nII search revealed that Continental Can Company had developed\na proprietary plastic pouch which had been tested by the\nU. S. Army Quartermaster Corps and by NASA. This pouch was\ncapable of being heat sterilized after filling and appeared\npromising. Samples were obtained for evaluation by KIST,\nand Continental Can was informed of the Korean interest but\nhas not pursued the interest further; apparently because of\nnegotiations being carried out in Japan.\nThe expanding chemical and process industries in\nKorea require pressure vessels for a variety of storage\ntanks and chemical reactor vessels. The technology for\nmanufacturing domes for such tanks by explosive metal\nforming was developed in the U. S. for defense and space\nneeds. The requirements to establish a pilot explosive\nmetalforming facility were judged to be too expensive at\nthe end of Phase II. However, expanding needs of Korean\nindustry may make this project economically viable in the\nnear future.\nThe Koreans do not presently have compact survival\nrations which are compatible with national tastes and\ndietary habits. The extensive research on dehydration,\ncompaction, and fortification for astronauts was reviewed\nand discussed with U. S. technologists by members of the\nKorean team. There was no direct transfer because of the\ndietary differences. The information gained about general\n,\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n33\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nprocesses and problems has formed the basis for KIST\nresearch to develop survival rations based on Korean\nfoods.\n\nC.\n\nRETROSPECTIVE CRITIQUE\n\nA review by the KIST and IITRI participants of the\ndesign and conduct of the pilot project has revealed a\nnumber of weaknesses and has reconfirmed the strength \'\nof certain project elements. We conclude that the use of\ntwo broadly based technological institutions, one in a\ndeveloped country and one in the developing nation, to :\nlocate technology applicable to specific needs can greatly\nfacilitate the transfer of technology to local industries.\nMinor changes in the project could improve its efficiency\nand impact, however.\n\nThe steps of initial problem selection and technical\ntranslation should be combined and performed while in residence\nat the developing country institution. In addition,\npreliminary economic evaluation should be performed on each\nproblem which successfully emerges from the translation step.\nThese changes will result in an extended Phase I but will\ngreatly increase the efficiency of Phase II activities and\nensure that any technical solutions found would have a reasonable\nchance of adaptation. The literature searches could be\ninitiated by the U. S. participants and the output could be\nsubjected to a preliminary screening prior to the arrival\nin the U. S. of specialists from the developing country.\n\nWhile the NASA technology data bank contains much\ninformation related to the needs of a developing nation, the\nU. S. transfer agent should be familiar with and have access\nIII RESEARCH\n\n34\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nto a far broader data base which would be more responsive\nto the priority problems of developing countries. The\ninformation and technology base from which the solutions ,\nare sought should include test, hardware, and .manufacturing\ndata as well as specific technical designs or processes.\nThose needs with potential economic impact for Korea were\nbroad, did not emphasize specific incremental advances, and\ngenerally required a number of technologies, including both\nsupporting processes and machinery.\nThe importance of person to person contact between\nthe specialist who will adapt the technology and the\nscientist or engineer who developed the technology was\nrepeatedly demonstrated. Details not present in the\npublished accounts of the technology but which surfaced\nduring discussions proved to be critical to the follow-on\nactivities time and time again. The inputs to the "buy or\nbuild" decision on the weather satellite receiver and unpublished laboratory data on inductorless circuits are but two\nexamples of the benefits to be derived from personal contact.\nIn retrospect, more interaction between KIST and IITRI on\nsite in Korea would have been beneficial to the project.\nThe needs selected for detailed followup should be\nsubjected to further economic analysis before proceeding with\nPhase III activities. This analysis should include limitations,\nif any, on initial costs (capital investment and production\nstart up) and on the acceptable manufacturing costs for the\nvolume projected for the first year or two of commercialization.\nThis analysis should be performed in conjunction with the\nindustry or industries that indicate a desire to adapt the\ntechnology. This economic analysis may eliminate some\nopportunities that are technically interesting but not really\neconomically promising. It would also specify the key information\nto be obtained in Phase III for those needs which do appear\nworth pursuing.\n\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nMT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n35\n\nThe total process of selecting needs, searching for\nrelevant technology, identifying transfer opportunities with\nsufficient impact, undertaking adaptive engineering, and\nhelping industry to achieve commercialization is time\nconsuming even in developed countries. A project to\ntransfer technology to a developing nation can be expected\nto take a minimum of two years to achieve any demonstrable\nindustrial utilization and three years is not an unreasonable\ntime schedule. The addition of personnel and funds can\nserve to accelerate the project to some degree but the\nsequential nature of the process limits the useful time\ncompression that can be achieved.\nIn the context of extended project timing,\nconsideration should be given to an interim evaluation\nmeeting at the point when the needs have been selected for\nin-depth transfer. This meeting should assess the expected\nimpact, the availability of supporting technologies required,\nthe resources required to carry the transfers to commercialization\nand the timing of the subsequent project activities.\nD.\n\nIMPACT UPON KOREA\n\nThe economic gains from import substitution and from\nincreased sales in the domestic and export markets due to\ntechnology transferred by this pilot project were largely\nunrealized at the time of the formal evaluation. The pilot\nproduction of miniaturized transceivers for domestic consumption\nhas reasonable expectations for continued growth and\nsignificant return on investment. Two other devices awaiting\ngovernment test and certification could yield measurable\nreturn within a year as well. However, a major economic\ngain for Korea is a number of years off. An evaluation in\n1975 should reveal whether the anticipated increases in\nemployment and balance of trade are real or illusory.\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\n36\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nA number of significant short term impacts can be\nidentified, however. These include positive changes in\nKorean industry, in KIST and in the interactions between\nthe two. In summary form, these impacts are:\n1.\n\nTwo Korean electronic firms are now capable\nof manufacturing more sophisticated products\nfor the domestic and government markets.\n\n2.\n\nThe concept of investment in R & D has been\nadvanced within segments of the Korean\nelectronics industry in addition to increased\nconfidence in KIST\'s ability to develop\n.marketable products and processes.\n\n3.\n\nKIST awareness of the importance of\nproviding training for industrial manufacturing\npersonnel has been increased.\n\n4.\n\nThe project has resulted in direct Korean\nsupport for nine development projects at\nKIST.\n\n5.\n\nThe need for economic studies as well as\nconsideration of the licensing and capital\nrequirements associated with technology\ntransfer has become more apparent to KIST.\n\n6.\n\nThe technical competence and morale of the\nKIST staff has been increased through\nexposure to advanced technology.\n\n7.\n\nThe ability of KIST to advise upon and\nmake decisions to "build or buy technology\nhas improved.\n\n8.\n\nKIST awareness of U. S. technology and\ninformation sources has greatly increased.\n\n9.\n\nKIST has institutionalized the search\nfor industrial needs and the technology\nsearch/transfer process.\n\nNT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n37\n\nE.\n\nKEY LEARNINGS\n\nIn addition to the understanding gained about the\ntechnology transfer methodology employed in this pilot\nproject, four major learnings have emerged.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAn AID input\xe2\x80\x94in program design and relatively\nlittle financial support\xe2\x80\x94can serve as an\nimportant catalyst in facilitating the transfer\nof technology by stimulating improved\ncoupling between U. S. sources of technology\nand developing nation transfer agents and\nbetween the agents and manufacturing firms\nof the developing country.\n\nDeveloping nations traditionally rely upon equipment\npurchases, joint ventures, and licensing arrangements to\nacquire foreign technology. These approaches can be\nhighly effective in the early stages of industrialization\nbut they do not always maximize the value added nor do they\ndevelop local innovative skills. Confidence,in the ability\nof local institutions to select technologies and adapt them\nin practical ways is often lacking, and, as a result,\nwillingness to risk limited resources on new approaches to the\nacquisition of technology is also missing. AID involvement\ncan provide important creditability to innovative programs\ninvolving local groups.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransfer agents in a developing nation\ncan serve a crucial role in the selection\nand adaptation of technology which\nindividual firms in the country could not\nduplicate in dealing directly with foreign\nindustry or foreign transfer agents.\n\nIndustries in developing countries generally do not\nhave personnel with the qualifications to search, evaluate,\nand adapt technology to their needs. Since this is not\nusually recognized by industry as a continuing process leading\nNT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n38\n\nto expansion and increased profit, the lack of resident\nskills is not surprising. Indeed, many U. S. companies\nrely on external sources of expertise for technological inputs.\nThis reliance on institutional experts must be cultivated in\ndeveloping countries.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIndustrial skills and resources necessary\nto implement solutions to expressed needs are\nvery important to the ultimate commercialization\nof the technology transfer. As such, an\nassessment of the training, financial support\nand technical assistance required to achieve\nproduction should be an integral part of the\nneed definition/selection process.\n/\n\nEach of the four transfers which formed the central\neffort of this pilot project encountered the problem of lack of\nindustrial skills and resources in different ways and in\nvarying degrees. While the need for some training of\nproduction workers to assemble miniaturized transceivers\nwas foreseen, the extent was underestimated. Similarly, the\ninability of the capacitor industry to undertake a new\nproduct development in anticipation of a growth market was\nnot adequately appreciated in advance.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA\' significant commitment of time, effort,\nand funds by the developing nation is\nrequired to pursue transfers to the point\nof economic impact.\n\nIn the context of the current program, although AID\nprovided funds to support the U. S. activities, Korea\nprovided support for all of the participating specialists\nincluding the transoceanic travel and applications\nengineering programs. The Korean investment of resources\nin this pilot effort in terms of money and technical personnel\nover the past two years has matched the U. S. investment.\nInstitutional support of this nature is very important to the\nsuccess of the project.\nI1T R E S E A 8 C H INSTITUTE\n\n39\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nIV.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe learnings, impacts and findings from this\npilot project for the transfer of technology to developing\ncountries lead to three recommendations.\n1.\n\nKIST has expressed a deep interest in continuing\ntheir technology transfer activities by further\nidentification of needs, technology search and\napplication engineering. If the Korean Ministry\nof Science and Technology and Korean industry\nare willing to support the KIST effort, we recommend\nthat AID provide the nominal dollar investment\nrequired to provide continued U. S. assistance\nfor an additional 12 to 24 months. This period\nshould be sufficient to demonstrate economic\nutility and to achieve full Korean institutionalization of the technology transfer process.\n\n2.\n\nThe pilot project has shown that a number of\nsignificant improvements in the methodology are\npossible and should result in an improved\ntechnology transfer process. We recommend that\na similar project be initiated with a country\npossessing a degree of industrialization and\nthe local institutions for technology transfer\nwhich compare with that of Korea. The goal\nwould be the demonstration of the efficacy\nof the revised need-oriented method.\n\n3.\n\nMany developing countries are just beginning\nthe process of industrialization and have major\nneeds in agriculture, housing, roads, and\nemployment for the unskilled. There is an\nexpressed lack of entrepreneurial attitudes in\nlocal institutions as well as in the populace.\nA need/solution-oriented program coupled with\nthe financial resources necessary to start new\nbusinesses or new ventures for existing firms,\ncould serve to stimulate local entrepreneurship.\nWe recommend that consideration be given to a\npilot project to identify technological\nsolutions for more primitive needs and to\ninitiate a local venture to commercialize the\nmost promising approach.\n\nNT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n41\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nAID/NASA PILOT PROJECT IN TECHNOLOGY\nTRANSFER TO A DEVELOPING NATION - KOREA\n\nIIT R E S E A R C H INSTITUTE\nA-l\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nInvolvement of Foreign Capital in Korean Economy\nThe relative importance of foreign investments and loans\nin Korea is shown in the following facts:\n...\n1. -Since 1967, foreign investments have increased at an\naverage annual rate of 33%.\n;\n2. Commercial loans from foreign sources have increased\nsubstantially, accounting for almost 68% of total foreign\ninvestment in 1970, as the Korean Government has embarked on a\nprogram to build up the economic infrastructure.\n3. The increase in amount of commercial loans as well\nas joint ventures indicates that the Korean Government is\n-pushing for reliance on private and equity investment as\niopposed to direct .public assistance.\nIncreased capital outlays have played a major role in\nhelping Korea achieve a GNP growth rate of nearly 12% per year\nfor the last four years, while progressing from an agricultural\neconomy to a state of industrialization. Korea\'s economic\ndevelopment during the past several years, and particularly\nthe remarkable increase in exports to countries throughout the\nworld, provides ample testimony of the abilities and competitive\nstrength of Korean industry. In 1960 manufactured goods made\nup only about 22% of the thirty-two million dollars in Korean\nexports. However, by 1970 manufactured goods accounted for\nalmost 8070 of total exports.\nThere is Korean Governmental recognition that in a growing\nbut still limited domestic market, exports offer an increasingly\nimportant method of achieving economic growth. Recent evidence\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nA-5\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nhas shown that countries having increases in exports averaging\nabout ten percent, experienced growth rates in total output\nin excess of six percent. Alternatively, the nations having\nonly a small increase in exports (less than 3 percent) experienced under four percent total output growth. The combination\nof a highly intelligent and abundant labor force, a relatively\nlow wage structure, and aggressive and forward-looking government policies has made it possible for Korea to have one of the\nmost rapidly growing economies among the developing nations.\nHowever, the concept of investment for research and\ndevelopment is still relatively new to most Korean companies.\nInvestigations determined that while many companies appear to\nbe aggressive in the domestic market, their exports are tied\ndirectly to past foreign technical assistance. Korean industries\nare just beginning to plan aggressive marketing of their own\nproducts in the export market encouraged by the recent policy\nof the ROK Government to offer loan and tax incentives.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-6\n\nAPPENDIX II\nAEROSPACE DATA BANK\n\nIII RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-7\n\nPage Intentionally Left Blank\n\nAerospace Data Bank\nIn order to enable its scientists and engineers to\nkeep abreast of the constantly changing scene in the aerospace\nsciences, NASA in 1962 initiated an indexing service called\nSTAR, Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports, which was\nmade available to NASA centers, their contractors, and libraries.\nBecause of the extremely diverse nature of aerospace research,\nnearly all scientific and technical disciplines are represented\nin STAR. The information included in STAR covers all NASA and\nNASA contractor reports, selected Defense Department and\ncontractor reports, Atomic Energy Commission reports, various\nother Government agencies such as The Bureau of Mines, The\nFederal Aviation Administration, The Department of Transportation,\netc., relevant conference proceedings, and selected foreign\nresearch reports.\nIn addition to NASA\'s STAR, the American Institute of\n. - - . . \' - \xe2\x80\xa2\ni\nAeronautics and Astronautics publishes an index called 1AA,\nInternational Aerospace Abstracts. This contains announcements\nand selected articles from over 800 technical journals, both\ndomestic and foreign. Selections to the index are made based\non aerospace interests, but many references of interest to nonaerospace activities are cited. The IAA indexing files date from\n1963.\nThese two indices make up the Aerospace Data Bank -- a\nfile now containing nearly one million technical references.\nThe chart on the following page shows a breakdown of the sources\nof information in the data bank.\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH\n\nA-9\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nNASA\'s AEROSPACE DATA BANK *\nSource of Information\n\n-\n\nNASA and its contractors\nDepartment of Defense\nOther U.S. Government Agencies\nOther U.S. Sources\n\nPer Cent Input\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\n12%\n. 17%\n3%\n32%\n\n,\n\nTOTAL U.S. Sources\nFree World\nSoviet Bloc\n\n64%\n\n.\n\' - . \' . \' . . .\n\n\'\n\'TOTAL Foreign Sources\nTOTAL\n\n-.\n\n19%\n17%\n/\n\n\'.\n36% -\n\n,\n\n100%\n\n*(This breakdown includes both STAR and IAA.)\nTo make the process of searching and selecting relevant\ninformation quicker and easier, NASA went to a computer-based file\nto store this information. This mechanized data retrieval system\noffers a very useful method of locating indexed references by\nthe following ways:\n-\n\nKey Word\nA u t h o r 1 s Name\nContract Number\nContractor Organization\n\nIIT RESEARCH\n\nA-10\n\nINSTITUTE\n\n\'\n\nOf course, the most important one, and the one used most Is\nthe Key Word search method. This enables an interested person\nto locate documents in a specific area or combination of areas.\nV\n\nNASA has helped to establish 6 Regional Dissemination Centers\n(RDC\'s) at Universities and not-for-profit research institutes\nacross the country. These centers have access to the Aerospace\nData Bank (and other literature sources) and provide search\nservices on a fee basis to their clients. These centers were\noriginally supported in their operation by NASA funds, but they\nare now becoming self-supporting through the fees charged for\ntheir services.\nThe first one, Aerospace Research Applications Center, was\nthe one which participated in the NASA/KIST program and provided\nvaluable assistance to the KIST staff on producing and running\nliterature searches.\nAnother special information dissemination center which is\npart of the Aerospace Data Bank is called COSMIC - Computer\nSoftware Management Information Center. This organization has\nbeen established at the University of Georgia to evaluate, file,\nand disseminate (at a fee) computer programs developed by NASA\nand other agencies. As more and more businesses and research\norganizations are using the help of computers in their analytical\nstudies, utilization of programs which have already been developed\ncan save a significant amount of time and money.\nSo, all of this is what makes up the information file we\ncall the Aerospace Data Bank. As large and formidable as it is,\nthe input and output technologies have advanced to the point\nwhere identification of relevant or required reports is now quite\neasy. It can even be done on real-time interaction with the\ncomputer on video display terminals.\n\nNT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\n-\'\n\nA-ll\n\nAPPENDIX III\nU.S. AND KOREAN PARTICIPANTS\n\n(IT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-13\n\ncc\nno\nC\xc2\xa3Q\n\nas\n\nGJ\n\nO)\n\nU.S. and Korean Participants\n\n.Phase I - Technical Mission Team\nMr. Henry Arnold\nTA/OST\nAgency for International Development\nDepartment of State\nWashington; D.

This work is being sponsored by the Han-Jin Electronics Company\nto produce miniature 49 MHz, communication devices for consumer and\nindustrial uses. Initially, this product will be marketed only\nwithin Korea, but eventual exportation\'of this is also being planned.\nThe problem areas investigated here were receiver circuit\nminiaturization, reduced power drain, and improved sensitivity. The\nliterature search through the data bank provided numerous relevant\ntechnologies for investigation and evaluation, involving developments\nproduced by NASA, the Defense Department and private industry. These\nwere all reviewed during the follow-up visits of Phase III.\nVarious techniques to solve the problems were investigated. These\ninvolved the use of monolithic and hybrid integrated circuit, microminiature discreet components and special circuitry. The Koreans\nobtained information on these approaches through discussions with NASA\npersonnel at the Goddard Spaceflight Center, the Manned Spacecraft\nCenter, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratories; with NASA and DOD\ncontractors such as Westinghouse, RCA, and Texas Instruments; and with\nprivate companies such as National Semiconductor, Motorola Semiconductor,\nFairchild Semiconductor, and Silicon General. More specifically, the\ncircuitry of the amplifiers and modulation circuits used in the\nApollo Extra Vehicular Communication System and the U. S. Army\'s\nPRC-95 transcriber, provided the necessary designs for wider operational\nrange and .decreased inter-modulation distortion.\nThese improvements coupled with KIST\'s own unique designs will\nallow Korea to market these devices at home and abroad more\ncompetitively.\n\nIIT RESEARCH\n\nINSTITUTE\n\nA-27\n\nThe photographs below show some of the KIST developments.\n\nTransceivers utilizing modified\naudio receiver parts (for lower\npower consumption) and high\nsensitivity amplifiers.\n\nElectronic parts distributioi\n\nInside structure of the new transceiver\nutilizing a diode modulator (circuit at\nright) compared with the structure of the\nconventional transceiver (circuit at left)\n\nIII RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-28\n\nThe Korean Government regulates the size of the transceivers\nsold in Korea to standardized dimensions; thus, the larger unit\nwill be for domestic use and the smaller one for export only.\nAbout 55 of the improved domestic unit have already been produced at KIST on a pilot basis.\n(2) The development of "pocket" page communication devices.\nThis is being sponsored at KIST by the Korean Ministry of\nCommunication. It calls for KIST to develop an operational\nprototype of such a system so that they can be manufactured\nwithin Korea. KIST has been pursuing the design of a two-way\ntone signaling system, and required assistance in learning of\napplicable circuitry and design schemes for such equipment.\nTwo sources were identified and contacted which provided\nthe required information and technical know-how. The Bell\nTelephone Laboratories, which developed such devices for use in\nthe Bell System, provided a report describing their design in\ndetail. Analysis of this data was very helpful to the KIST\nspecialists in formulating their design approach. Further, NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Labs had developed a miniature, tone-modulated\nFM transmitter which had a number of features directly applicable\nto what the Koreans wished to build. Through study and evaluation of the technical report on this device, personal\ndiscussions with the innovator/designer, and inspection and test\nof the device itself, the KIST people were able to adapt several\nof the techniques applied by JPL. Namely, the circuitry of the\nminiature hybrid integrated circuits and the special integrated\nantenna were incorporated by the Koreans into their own design.\nThus far, a prototype of a two tone warning signal transmitter has been built and future efforts will involve development\nof a combination tone-transceiver device. No commercial sales\nimpact has been estimated for this; however, KIST anticipates\nIII RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-29\n\nthat these devices will be built and marketed by the Gold\nStar Electric Company in Korea.\n(3) The development of improved military transceiver equipment.\nThis project is sponsored by the Korean Ministry of Science\nand Technology and is related to the fact that Korea wishes to\nestablish a capability to support its own defense. One phase of\nthe project involves converting older tube-type units to an all\nsolid state design. Technologies basically the same as that for\nthe citizens band units have been used to produce the prototypes\nof the modified units shown below.\n\nA new transceiver utilizing presstalk switch\nA new transceiver of module\ntype inner construction\n\nModified PRC-10 with module\nconstruction and frequency\nselection (at left) compared\nwith old PRC-10 (at right)\n\nIIT\n\nRESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-30\n\nThis KIST effort has resulted in devices which are more\nreliable, consume less power, have increased power output, and\nhave a multi-channel capability. A number of these units have\nbeen built and are now undergoing field testing by the Korean\nArmed Forces.\nAnother phase of this project at KIST has involved the\nmodification of a military transmitter-receiver set obtained\nduring the follow-up trip of Phase III. KIST has re-designed\nthe system to incorporate two existing devices into one which\nmounts on the side of an infantry helmet.\n\nBoth the transmitter at the left of the picture and the\nreceiver in the center, have been housed in the receiver casing\nalone by utilizing the micro-miniature electronics technology\ndescribed earlier.\nThese units are experimental in design and their utility as\ncombat devices is being evaluated by the Korean military. If\nthey are approved, KIST will then assist Korean industry in gearing\nup for production. Future efforts along these lines at KIST\nwill involve the application of these technologies in the development of a new, Korean-designed military transceiver.\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-31\n\nEE-3\n\nHigh Sensitivity Transceivers\n\nThis problem area consists of four separate sub-projects\nbeing supported at KIST by Korean government funding from the\nMinistry of Science and Technology. They are:\n(1) The development of supersensitive receiving circuits\nfor commercial FM radios and television receivers.\nKIST is interested in developing an improved tuning system\nto incorporate into Korean made FM radios and TV sets which would\ngive them a performance advantage over competitive products.\nBasically, this has involved the investigation of phase-lockedloop technology and its application to the tuning circuit of\nthese devices. In the meetings with specialists from NASA Centers,\nDOD installations, government contractors, and private industry,\nthe Koreans obtained schematic designs of special circuits,\ncircuitry layout descriptions, and optimum component specifications\nBased on these discussions the KIST participants devised discreet\nand integrated circuit designs for an improved tuning system.\nA prototype unit for FM radio use has already been developed at\nKIST, and efforts are now being directed towards producing a\ncomplete, consumer-oriented product design. This will then be\ntransferred to a Korean company for manufacture and marketing.\nThe project to incorporate such designs into a television\nreceiver is just being established. The use of these phaselocked-loop techniques to detect the video portion of TV signals\nis a new application. The basic problem is one of economics,\nthat is, to incorporate an effective and efficient system in a\nTV set using low-cost electronic parts. KIST hopes to succeed\nin this effort within the next year.\n(2) The development of a digital frequency synthesizer for\nmulti-channel transceivers.\n\n(IT R E S E A R C H I N S T I T U T E\n\nA-32\n\nKIST is interested in incorporating a multi-channel capability\n.in their transceiver developments; initially with the military\nunits, and eventually with consumer devices. Phase-locked-loop\ndigital frequency synthesizers are devices which can provide a\nlarge number of usable channels easily and inexpensively.\nThe Koreans have had discussions with a number of specialists\nin this area to evaluate potential designs and to obtain some\ncommercially available units for testing. As a result, a prototype frequency synthesizer has been developed at KIST and has\nbeen installed in the modified military transceiver shown in\nthe photograph on page A-21. The photograph below shows the frequency (channel) selection controls on the transceiver.\n\nFront control dials of the radio\ntransceiver showing frequency\nsynthesizer selector\nDesign plans are now being developed to produce a similar system\nwhich will require only one-half the power which the present\nsystem consumes.\n(3) The design of a television signal translator-repeater\nstation.\nKorea wishes to expand the beneficial effects that television\ncan have on the overall social development of rural communities.\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-33\n\nThus, a critical factor is enlarging the effective range of the\nTV transmitting stations and penetrating the mountainous regions\nprevalent in Korea. So KIST has undertaken a project to design\na special TV translator-repeater that would receive a TV signal\nand retransmit it through the air or by cable to a nearby\ncommunity.\nThe Korean Broadcasting System and other Korea stations\nhave expressed great interest in purchasing units for field\ninstallations in the next year or two. This project has just\nrecently been initiated at KIST and the design should be\ncompleted in early 1973. The most difficult aspect of the\nproject will be in the development of wideband UHF amplifiers\nand accurate oscillators operable in the wide temperature range\nof the natural Korean environment. The learnings made by the\nKIST participants regarding highly accurate oscillator circuits\nduring their visits will help them in this development. The\nHan-Jin Electronics Company has expressed an interest in manufacturing and selling these repeater stations to Korean customers.\n(4) The design and development of mobile transceivers.\nKorea has been importing thousands of mobile (automobile type)\ntransceivers yearly, and now wishes to apply its technical expertise and manufacturing capability to supply this product\ndomestically. KIST has been funded by the Korean government to\ndevelop a design which would be produced and sold to Korean\ncustomers, and could also eventually be exported. They are\ndeveloping a 450-MHz, 12 volt transceiver incorporating microminiature integrated circuits and utilizing phase-locked-loop\ntechniques for improved sensitivity. This should be completed\nand ready for transfer to a Korean company by the end of 1973.\nEE-18\n\nInductorless Circuit Technology\n\nThis transfer case came about as a direct result of the\nminiature transceiver follow-up visits to NASA\'s Goddard SpaceIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-34\n\nflight Center by the KIST researchers. In meetings with the\nNASA specialists to discuss special microcircuit design and\nutilization techniques related to the general transceiver problem\narea, this novel technical development was described as a possible\nsolution. Essentially, it involves the design of stable active\nfilter networks and oscillators in the VHF and UHF range without\nthe use of any inductors. As inductors can be bulky, expensive,\nand sometimes difficult to tune, the elimination of these devices\ncan greatly simplify electronic circuits. Further, this would\nallow a considerable reduction in the overall size of the circuit\nand would make it amenable to micro-miniature design in the form\nof an integrated circuit.\nThe KIST principals felt that this technology has potential\napplication to a broad range of electronic products which could\nbe made more reliable, smaller, and cheaper by the use of these\ntechniques. So this area was then selected as a transfer to be\npursued in its own right, and a separate follow-up effort was\nmade to learn more about the basic design principles from the\nU. S. specialists. Visits to the Goddard Spaceflight Center and\nits contractors, Martin Marietta and Gaertner Research, provided\nthe necessary information and know-how to pursue this further\nat KIST. A factor made clear to the Koreans was that this\ntechnology was still in the experimental stage and that additional\ntheoretical and experimental analysis was still required to allow\npractical production applications. KIST was provided with a\nsample inductorless UHF filter, and detailed information on the\ncomputer-aided design of active band-pass filters. The Koreans\nalso obtained additional data on new commercially available\nelectrical components and micro-electronic production facilities\nthrough visits with some of the leading companies in the field\nsuch as, Hewlett-Packard, TRW Semiconductor Division, Varian\nAssociates, Lockheed Missiles and Space Company-Microelectronics\nFabrication Division, and the COMSAT Research and Development\nLaboratories.\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-35\n\nAfter the follow-up visits, KIST embarked on a detailed\nstudy and design analysis of the inductorless circuits. They\nhave produced and tested several types of circuits and learned\nthat their temperature stability needed substantial improvement\nif they were to be used in consumer products. So the Koreans\ndeveloped a technique to make the circuit less sensitive to changes\nin temperature and thus practical for use outside of a laboratory\nsituation. A breadboard 50 MHz FM receiver was built and is now\nbeing tested.\n\nExperimental set-up of the VHF-FM receiver\nusing active band-pass filters having no\nbulky inductors.\nFurther work by KIST to adapt and commercialize this technology\nhas been structured into a three phase development program:\nPhase I - Design and construction of Prototype Miniature\nFM receivers of 50, 150 and 450 MHz.\nPhase II - Production of Receivers in Breadboard Integrated\nCircuit Form.\nPhase III - Study of Mass Production Considerations\nIII RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-36\n\nPhase I has already been successfully completed, and the project is moving on to Phase II. KIST expects to apply the\nsuccessful outcome of the project initially to their transceiver\ndevelopment programs and ultimately to other industrial and\nconsumer electronic products. As these practical applications\nare still 1 to 2 years away, a quantitative estimate of their\ncommercial impact is difficult to make; however, in a qualitative\nsense, KIST sees Korean industry making significant gains in\nthe consumer electronics market by virtue of the product improvements they plan to develop and apply.\nMM-4\n\nTantalum Electrolytic Capacitors\n\nKorean industries have expressed great interest to KIST\nin acquiring the manufacturing technology for these capacitors.\nSo KIST was interested in establishing a pilot manufacturing\ncapability to make tantalum capacitors, which could be demonstrated and transferred to a Korean company.\nIn this problem area, the Koreans were interested in getting\na broad range of information on the overall technology of\ntantalum capacitor production. The literature search supplied\nthe names of the major U. S, producers of these capacitors and\nprovided numerous relevant documents relating to Government\nsponsored developments in the area. The majority of these developments were related to advances in reliability and quality control\nfor the capacitors in mass production, while little information\nwas obtained relative to the basic process engineering. A number\nof visits were made by the Koreans to several of the leading\nU. S. companies to obtain the following data:\n1. An overview of the tantalum capacitor industry involving\nproduction facilities, capital requirements, and overall technology\ncontents.\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-37\n\n2. The availability of production machinery equipment,\nand engineering technical support services from U. S. firms.\n3. Technical discussion with specialists on the current\nR & D emphasis in the field and the market trend in the U. S.\nand overseas.\nAdditionally, the KIST researchers visited tantalum powder\nproducers to assess their suitability to ultimately supply\na Korean manufacturer, and to obtain sample materials for\ntesting at KIST.\n\nThe project to establish a pilot manufacturing facility\nis progressing very well. The Koreans have succeeded in producing high quality tantalum capacitors from their process.\nThe photograph below shows several samples of the capacitors\nproduced at KIST.\n\nI\n\ni\n\n1 I II\nII III! ll!l|lll!llllliinip[|l!l III] III Nil!

This\nwork is progressing well and now the quality control information\nretrieved from the data bank will be reviewed and applied to establish a fully operational and efficient process.\nAlong with this development program, KIST is approaching\nthree interested Korean manufacturers to support a thorough\ntechno-economic and market study for tantalum capacitor production.\nThe three companies include Tai-Han Electric Company, Sam Sung\nElectronics, and Sam Wha Condenser Company. The KIST specialists\nfeel that the results of this survey, along with the availability\nof an operational pilot manufacturing line, will be instrumental\nin "selling" one of the industries to enter the market. At that\ntime, KIST will transfer all of its know-how regarding the production procedures and facilities to the sponsoring Korean company, and will assist in the training of key industrial personnel.\nEE-16\n\nWeather Satellite Picture Receiving Station\n\nDuring the Phase II session, the Koreans obtained a NASA\nreport which described the construction and operation of a weather\nsatellite picture receiving station. They brought the document\nback to KIST for analysis and evaluation, and subsequently met\nwith Korea\'s Office of Central Meterology to discuss the possibility\nof establishing such a system ap KIST. As a result of these meetings,\nthe Meterology Office has provided the necessary funds to develop\na receiving system. After studying the NASA documentation, the\nKoreans requested informational follow-up by IITRI to acquire\na technical appraisal and a detailed cost estimate for the parts\nand supplies necessary to build a unit. Specialists at NASA\'s\nGoddard Spaceflight Center have assisted in providing the necessary\ninformation to KIST. They recommended that KIST purchase an existing\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-39\n\ncommercially available system from a company licensed by NASA\nto produce them. The EMR Aerospace Sciences Corporation, which\nwas the original Goddard Center contractor in this area, is one\nof the companies currently manufacturing systems under NASA\nauthorization, and they have provided KIST with specific technical and cost data on all the system components.\nKIST has made a decision to establish two new receiving\nsystems, one to be purchased from a U. S. supplier and the other\nto be built at KIST using the NASA designs. By building one\nsystem themselves, the Koreans can incorporate some of their\nown developments in the receiver (specifically, they plan to\nuse the inductorless circuit techniques in building the 135MHz FM receiver section) and they can build up working experience with the system design so that they can perform any\nrequired maintenance and trouble-shooting. KIST plans to have\nboth of these systems built and operational by Spring of 1973.\n\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-40\n\nII.\n\nLimited Follow-up Problems\nFT-1\n\nRetort Pouch as a Flexible Packaging Material\n\nThis problem was investigated to identify packaging materials\nand techniques which could be used to replace standard tin cans\nfor many foods packaged in Korea. Based on a search of the Aerospace Data Bank, Dr. Tai Won Kwon identified a new packaging\nmaterial which would be useful to the Korean food industry. Rights\nto this technology belong to Continental Can Company, and we have\nconducted preliminary inquiries about obtaining a license. The\nContinental Can Company seems interested in licensing this technology and they plan to hold discussions soon with the interested\nKorean company. During the course of the project, Continental\nCan Company has supplied samples of the pouch for experimentation\nby Dr. Kwon at KIST. Dr. Kwon has been studying the pouch\'s\napplicability to both military and commercial packaging uses.\nHis initial results have indicated that it works well; however,\nhe plans more experimental verification of the shelf life and\nstorage capability of the pouch and foodstuff. KIST expects\ncontinued government funding of this project and if the results\nof his work are favorable, mass production of these pouches in\nKorea would be strongly recommended.\nFT-5\n\nSurvival Rations\n\nThis project at KIST is sponsored by the Korean Defense\nagency to develop military rations suitable to Korean tastes.\nA search of the data bank revealed a substantial amount of\ninformation concerning new food developments and survival rations.\nMuch of this data helped Dr. T. W. Kwon in structuring and carrying\nout his research program at KIST. A NASA development in preparing\nand using freeze dried rice as a food ration was evaluated by KIST,\nbut found unagreeable to Korean tastes and customs. The NASA\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-41\n\nfreeze drying process made the rice too soft and starchy,\nand this is apparently unacceptable to Koreans. Nonetheless,\nthis product provided an interesting approach at preserving\nprecooked food which KIST is currently studying.\nCE-1\n\nCarbon Monoxide Elimination\n\nKorea needs improved technology for producing industrial\nand military gas masks and appropriate carbon monoxide elimination\nchemicals. While a search of the Aerospace Data Bank did not\nreveal any immediately applicable technology, it did produce a\nlarge amount of technical information related to current research\nin this field. Additionally, the search disclosed that the Army\nNatick Laboratories had sponsored a substantial amount of research\nin this area with industrial contractors. Contact will be made\nwith the appropriate specialists when KIST is prepared to move\nahead in this area and the necessary project funding is secured.\nMM-7\n\nExplosive Metalforming\n\nThe Koreans expressed a desire to establish a pilot facility\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of explosive metalforming techniques\nDuring Phase II, Dr. Yoon inspected a facility at the Denver Research\nInstitute and received an engineering cost estimate to establish\na facility at KIST. Dr. Yoon coordinated with Korean industry to\ndetermine the characteristics of the metals and parts that might\nbe formed. Based on these inputs he concluded that such a facility\nwas not cost effective at that time. However, a review of Korean\nindustry requirements in this area was made during the Phase IV\nevaluation trip and it appears that this type of manufacturing\nfacility may now be justified. Appropriate specialists will be\ncontacted by KIST to evaluate this technical area in more detail.\nIf an explosive forming facility is indeed warranted, then KIST\nwill establish a project to actively pursue a transfer of this\ntechnology.\nIll RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n\nA-42\n\n'
