If the upturn continues into the activity maximum of solar cycle 22, a relation between solar activity and luminosity of possible climatological significance could be ascertained. The best-fit relationship for the variation of total irradiance S with sunspot number Rz and 10-cm flux F(10) are S = 1366.82 + 7.71 x 10 to the -3rd Rz and S = 1366.27 + 8.98 x 10 to the -3rd F(10)(W/sq m). These findings could be used to approximate total irradiance variations over the periods for which these indices have been compiled.", "title": "Solar luminosity variations in solar cycle 21", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T16:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880050091, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Willson, Richard C."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "4f2d869fca32400f83e708d9dc3f902f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880050091, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hudson, H.
