Trade studies performed concerned the size of the crew, the impact of\nlunar stay time intervals, and the options for packaging and shipping of spares and\nconsumables. Design requirements for a logistics supply module were also produced. To\naccomplish the above, the CNDB Lunar Base Scenario (Ref. 1) was reviewed and a modified\nversion used as a baseline (see appendix A). High level maintenance and supply functions\nwere defined. Some of the design and operational approaches developed for the Space\nStation were either retained where commonality was desired or modified and applied to\nthe Lunar Base.\nThe requirement to design for maintainability must play a much larger role in this program\nthan has been the case in the past. A very complex system must be maintained at a\ngreat distance by a handful of people. This is without precedent in space work.\n\nA phased approach was taken for both maintenance and logistics operations to support\nthe Lunar B s . Maintenance and logistics operations were minimized during the early\nae\nphase of the base build up and gradually increased as the equipment and crew complement\nallowed.\n\nIn the first period of 8 day surface stay times, the mode of operation is similar to that\nof the Apllo missions where the crew operated out of the lander and depended on\nsubsystem redundancy instead of planned maintenance. Logistic activities during this\nperiod are primarily limited to delivery of items to the lunar surface and temporary storage\nof spares and consumables. The next period of 24 day Surface stay time missions, allowed\noperation from a pressurized habitat module which enabled Lunar Base crew interaction\nwith onboard systems which tracked maintenance and logistic activities and hardware.\nA minimum level of maintenance activities was envisioned for this period with the availability\nof limited spares and maintenance capabilities. In the final period of 180 day surface\nstays and permanent occupancy of the Lunar Base, scheduled maintenance and routine\nlogistics are incorporated into the daily activities.\nThe crew size trade led to a baseline crew size of four which permitted the minimum\nweight and volume impact to the transportation system but limited the amount of crew\ntime available to perform lunar surface operations. Comparisons between crew sil and\nkl\nspecialty mix to d a c e operational activities led to a preference for a larger crew size\nto provide the necessary specialty mix and crew hours available to perform the tasks\nenvisioned to support Lunar Base buildup and operation. A crew size of six provided\nmaximum operational flexibility ( h e shifts) with a minimum of weight penalty.\ntre\nInvestigations into extending the crew d a c e stay times showed that stay times for\nboth short and medium duration missions could be increased with a small delta weight\nimpact for consumables. These impacts amounted to 52 kg. (113 lbs.) to extend the\nsurface stay time from 8 days to 11 days, and 307 kg. (675 lbs.) to extend the Surface\nstay time from 24 days to 42 days for a crew of 4. In both cases, the impacts are\nsmall with respect to performing an additional mission to gain the operational crew\ntime for lunar surface operations. Factors not considered in the stay time extension\nstudy were the effects of crew fatigue and limitations due to Earth/Moon orbital mechanics.\n1\n\nEarly indications suggest that optimum launch windows occur at intervals of approximately 9 days. The issue of surface stay time should be reevaluated after a detailed\nstudy is done on transportation orbital mechanics.\nThe study on packaging and supply options indicated that for the earlier missions of 8\nand 24 day surface stay times, the consumables could be carried with the manned missions.\nThe baseline scenario did not include provisions for spares for equipment delivered to\nthe lunar surface. Spares make up a large fraction of the maintenance and supply mass\ndelivered to the Lunar Base. Mass estimates indicate that dedicated cargo flights carrying\nonly spares may be required. For the later manned missions where permanent Lunar\nBase occupancy in considered, Logistic Modules should be developed to deliver spares\nand consumables to the lunar surface. A conceptual design for the logistic supply module\nevolved to three modules, a pressurized supply module, a tank module, and pallet modules.\nAdditionally, a need for a facility to temporarily store spares and disposed reusable\nmaterials was identified.\n\n2.0 Introduction\nThe object of the Maintenance and Supply Option task was to develop a high level\noperational philosophy related to maintenance and supply operations and incorporate\nthose concepts into the Lunar B s Study. Specific products to be generated during\nae\nthis task were three trade studies and a conceptual design of the Logistic Supply Module.\nThe crew size trade study was performed to evaluate crew sizes from the baseline size\nof four to a crew size of eight and determine the preferred crew size. The second trade\na\nstudy w s to determine the impact of extending surface stay times and recommend a\npreferred duration of stay time as a function of crew, consumables, and equipment support\ncapabilities. The third trade study was an evaluation of packaging and storage methods\nto determine the preferred logistics approach to support the Lunar Base.\na\ned\nThe approach taken w s to evaluate the Civil N e s Data Base Lunar Base (CNDB) Scenario and develop a high level approach to maintenance and supply operations. From\nthis, a modified scenario was developed and served as the basis of the individual trade\nstudies. Assumptions and guidelines were also developed from experience with Apollo\nprograms, Space Shuttle operations, and Space Station studies. With this information,\nthe trade studies were performed and a conceptual design for the Logistic Supply Module\nw s developed.\na\n\n3.0 Baseline Definition\nThe starting point for a baseline description of the Lunar Base and it missions scenario\nwas the CNDB with its Option III mission elements. This scenario was evaluated and\naugmented in an inhouse activity under ASTS T s 4.1, Surface Mission Operations, which\nak\ndescribed a proposed alternative scenario for Lunar Base development. This alternative\nscenario, (Appendix A), served as a baseline for detailed development of timelines, operational\nconcepts, and definition of surface elements necessary to support a Lunar Base. Detailed\nequipment variations and timeline changes caused by maintenance and supply considerations\nak\nare identified in T s 4.1.\n\n2\n\n4.0 Guidelines and Assumptions\nGuidelines and assumptions for this task were derived from three primary sources: (1)\nSpace Station studies, (2) NASA provided guidelines and (3) task developed guidelines\nand assumptions. Listed below are the guidelines and assumptions grouped according to\ntheir category:\n\n0\n\nSpace Station developed guidelines (Ref. 2)\n\n0\n\nECLSS for the Personnel Transfer Module and Lunar Base Habitat Module\nwill be similar to the Space Station design\nECLSS water loop closure will be 97%\nECLSS CO, loop will be regenerative\nAtmosphere leakage out of the Personnel Transfer Module is assumed to be\n.57 kg. (1.25 lb.) of atmosphere per day\nAutomatic servicing and checkout of two suits can be accomplished in a 12\nhour cycle\nHabitable volume required to support each additional crewperson is 4.25 cu.\nm. (150 cu. ft.), assuming Space Station size modules (Ref. 3).\n\nNASA provided guidelines\nEVA will be accomplished with a minimum of two crewpersons\nEach crewperson will have an EMU\nEMU\xe2\x80\x99S will be of a high pressure design and wl not require prebreathing\nil\nEMU\xe2\x80\x99S will incorporate regenerative CO control\nThe mass of each EMU will be 136 kg. (300 lb.)\nCrewperson m s will be representative of a 50 percentile male at 82 kg.\nas\n(181 lb.)\nPersonal effects and clothing to support each additional crewperson will be\n112 kg. (269 lb.)\nAirlock atmosphere loss is assumed to be .6 kg. (1.32 lb.) per cycle (Ref. 4).\nThe Space Station airlock is predicted to be able to recover all but 6% of\nthe air per cycle.\n\n0\n\nTask developed assumptions\n\n-\n\nCNDB Alternative Option IU is the baseline scenario\nEVA duration is 6 hours nominal/ 8 hours contingency\nEach crewperson shall not exceed 3 EVAs per 7 day period\nPersonnel Transfer Module will serve as the lunar surface habitat for the 14\nday missions\nNo provisions for clothes washing, dish washing, or crew showers will be\nprovided in the Personnel Transfer Module\nThe crew will occupy the Habitat Module once it has been delivered to the\nlunar surface and the subsystems verified operational\n\n5.0 Operational Concepts for Manned Missions\nSince the Lunar Base will be developed after the Space Station has been operational for\nseveral years, the maintenance and logistics concepts for the Lunar Base will be compatible\nwith the Space Station system. In this section those Space Station concepts are applied\n3\n\nto the Phase 1 Lunar Base. An operations scenario was developed to outline the tasks\n1\nthat had a direct bearing on the issues of maintenance and logistics. With a basic scenario\nin place, trade studies were performed to evaluate options desired by NASA.\n\n5.1 Lunar Base Operations\nThe development of the Lunar Base is divided into three periods of increasing surface\nstay times. The manned missions are initially 14 days in duration and grow to 30 days\nand later to 186 day missions. The total mission duration times include the transit times\nbetween the Earth and the Moon as well as the Surface stay times. Appendix A describes\nthe activities of the crew in detail on a mission by mission basis. The following section\nprovides a descriptive overview of each period and separates the operational philosophy\nby the available resource capabilities.\n5.1.1\n\nEight Day Stay Surface Missions\n\nThe initial series of missions are combined manned and unmanned missions which deliver\nequipment and crew to the lunar surface to establish the base. During this period, the\nsurface stay time is expected to be on the order of 8 days with the mode of operation\nvery similar to that used for the Apollo Lunar Missions. In this period, essentially\neverything that is necessary to support the crew and equipment will be carried on-board\nthe vehicles for each mission. The base of operation during these missions will be the\nPersonnel Transfer Module which also serves as the habitable module for travel to and\nfrom Earth. No other provisions are available for habitation on the lunar surface during\nthese missions. Planned maintenance during this period is minimal and subsystem fault\nrecovery is primarily dependent upon hardware redundancy.\n5.1.2\n\nTwenty-four Day Surface Stay Missions\n\nThis series of missions is characterized by the availability of the Habitat Module on\nthe lunar Surface which allows the surface stay time to be extended to 24 days. The\nbase of operations will now be centered in the Habitat Module with improved crew\naccommodations and the availability of the Operations Management System and its attendant\nMaintenance Management System which are controlled from a workstation in the module.\nContinual buildup of the Lunar Base occurs with the delivery of major elements to the\nlunar surface by expendable lunar landers. Scheduled maintenance of equipment is now\na part of the crew tasks and unscheduled repairs are performed with spares in stock.\nLimited diagnosis of Line Replaceable Units (LRU\xe2\x80\x99s) is enhanced when the pressurized garage\nis delivered to the surface on Mission 21.\n5.1.3\n\n180 Day Surface Stay Missions\n\nWith the completion of the initial L n r Base with self sufficient electrical power, the\nua\nthird period of Lunar Base operations begins. In this period, the surface stay time will\nbe extended to 180 days which allows permanent occupation of the Lunar Base. Up to 8\npeople will be at the base for a majority of the time. In this period, the Lunar Base\nwill still be dependent on Earth for consumables such as food, water, nitrogen, crew\nequipment, and spare parts. Operation of the Lunar Base is now a continual activity\nwith regular scheduled maintenance of equipment on the lunar surface and limited repair\ncapability of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s below the modular level. Operations are now focused outwards with\nemphasis on Lunar Science and Surface Exploration which requires longer duration excursions\naboard the rovers. Consumables, spares, and other supplies to support the needs of the\n4\n\nLunar Base have now outgrown the capability of the manned landers. Dedicated unmanned\ndelivery of Logistics Modules to the lunar surface is now required.\n\n5.2\n\nMaintenance Operations\n\nThe approach recommended for maintenance of Lunar Base equipment is similar to that\nused for the Space Station. The capabilities to perform maintenance related tasks will,\nhowever, be phased in a manner consistent with the operational capabilities discussed\nearlier. These capabilities are driven by the resources available in each period of the\nLunar Base development. Table 1 shows the maintenance functions required by each period.\n\n5.2.1\n\nEight Day Surface Stay Maintenance Operations\n\nDuring the first period of Lunar Base development, which is marked by the 8 day surface\nstay time and operations from the Personnel Transfer Module, maintenance will primarily\nbe accomplished by the replacement of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s or modular components which are identified\nas limited life items. Spare replacement components and servicing elements will be\nidentified prior to each manned mission and be carried aboard the manned vehicle for\nservice by the crew. Scheduling and planning of activities related to maintenance will\nbe performed on E r h and support provided to the crew in real time during the maintenance\nat\nactivities. Spares for items to be replaced inside the habitable volume will be stored\ninside the volume whereas those spares for equipment normally operated in an unpressurized\nenvironment wiU be carried outside the pressurized volume. Subsystem monitoring and\nl\ntrend analysis supporting maintenance activities will be performed on Earth. Al unused\nspares and servicing items not required for the return flight will be left at the Lunar\nBase in a designated storage area.\n\n5.2.2\n\nTwenty-four Day Surface Stay Maintenance Operations\n\nIn the next period with the Habitat Module on the lunar surface and a 24 day stay\nperiod, maintenance activities such as subsystem data collection and near-term maintenance\nscheduling can partially be transferred to the Lunar Base. The presence of the Lunar Base\nOperations Management System (OMS) and the Maintenance Management System (MMS)\nallows real-time monitoring of the subsystems, resources, consumables, and spares. The\nOMS performs the top level function of controlling subsystems and resources and feeds\ndata to the MMS. The data fed from the OMS to the MMS provides information on\nmaintenance status and schedules, and wl be available for viewing or interfacing at the\nil\ncrew workstation in the Habitat Module. Maintenance tasks to be performed by the\ncrew will be assisted by M M S generated information on LRU status, spares location, tool\nusages, and procedures. EVA maintenance and repairs wiU be assisted by helmet mounted\ndisplays and audio cues for presentation of procedures and checklists which are stored\nin the MMS data memory.\nProvisions for shirtsleeve maintenance and repairs of lunar surface equipment will be\npossible with the availability of a pressurized module which is capable of enclosing a\nmanned rover vehicle. Included in this module will be test and checkout equipment as\nwell as spares and tools. With a pressurized facility, maintenance and repairs of equipment\nwill be greatly enhanced due to the removal of the EVA suit operational limitations. The\ncapability to perform failure diagnosis of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s at the subcomponent level will minimize\nthe need to return failed spares to Earth. The diagnostic analysis and system test\nfunctions should be accessible from E r h to minimize the impact to crew time.

Crew time on the lunar surface is\nextremely expensive and should be utilized for scientific and operational functions as\nmuch as possible.\n\n523\n..\n\n180 Day Stay Maintenance Operations\n\nIn the last period of Lunar Base development, the presence of a permanent crew on the\nlunar surface will change the operational philosophy of maintenance and repair. Maintenance\nand repair will now be a signrficant part of the activity of scheduled surface operations.\nSince the Base will be continually operated, preventative maintenance activities will be\nemphasized more and scheduled around routine operational activities such as Lunar Base\nbuildup, landing/launch site operations, subsystem management, oxygen mining and production,\nlife science and materials laboratory experiments, and lunar surface and field geology\nexploration.\nCrew support of maintenance activities on the lunar surface is expected to occupy from\n5 to 20 percent of the available time. T i time estimate is based on Air Force ground\nhs\nelectronic equipment earthside experience (Ref. 5 ) . The ground based maintenance is\nperformed by maintenance personnel instead of the flight crew. For the Lunar Base,\nthe flight crew must perform the work, so the systems must be designed to be maintained\nby the crew without severely impacting operational crew t h e .\nA reference point on the amount of maintenance time required, developed from Space\nStation studies indicates the need for approximately four crew hours per day for maintenance\nactivities (Ref. 6). For the Lunar Base, factors such as the presence of construction\nand transportation equipment along with the lunar surface environment of dust will\nrequire more maintenance support than expected for the Space Station. The actual time\nrequired for maintenance is unknown and could easily be large. The systems must be\nil\ndesigned to hold maintenance time to an acceptable fraction of crew time. This wl\nrequire a higher priority on maintenance in the design phase than has been the practice\nin previous programs. Service and repair of remote site experiments and their related\nequipment will be another function of the Lunar Base crew in this period. Spares inventory\nbuilt up over the previous missions will allow for a large stock of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s to support the\nmaintenance activities. Predictive trend monitoring equipment in the OMS coupled with\nthe MMS will schedule the delivery of new spares from E r h to meet the needs of the\nat\nLunar Base.\n\n5.3 Logistics Operations\nThe logistics operations for the Lunar Base are concerned with the packaging, scheduling,\ndistribution, and storage of equipment, spares and consumables to supply the lunar surface\noperations.\nSince the Lunar Base will be developed after the Space Station has been operational for\nsome years, the maintenance and logistics concepts for the Lunar Base should be compatible\nwith the Space Station system. Compatibility issues such as commonality of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s and\ndimensional standards on storage containers to assure that they can be handled and\nsecured properly during each phase of the delivery process from the Earth to the Moon\nshould be considered. Commonality of LRU\xe2\x80\x99s is critical for the Lunar Base so that the\nsame LRU will be able to support many different subsystems and subcomponents. By properly\n\n7\n\nspecifying common LRU\xe2\x80\x99s, the number of spares should be reduced and the reliability\nand production costs of the LRU improved.\nLogistics for the lunar base involves three locations in a complex tracking and mass\nhandling operation. First, the only source of supplies during the first six years of lunar\noperations is the Earth. At a later date, oxygen supplies will be supplemented by lunar\noxygen production from the pilot and production plants. The data bases which track\nthe equipment availability, maintenance schedule, packaging, shipping and life t h e use\nwill be based on the Earth and the Moon. The supplies are transported to the Space\nStation which serves several functions including:\n\n-\n\ntemporary holding point to prepare for final shipment to the Moon.\nminimal repackaging for shipment\nequipment checkout and minimal refurbishment\nsource of supplies needed immediately when unavailable from the Earth\n\nPresently, the Space Station will not be able to support all of these functions. This\nsupport capability will be required of the Space Station to make the Lunar Base logistics\noperations viable.\n\nil\nLogistics support for the lunar base wl develop in three periods. The first, the build\nup phase, supports the shorter 8 day surface stay when the crew is housed in the Personnel\nTransfer Module (PTM). The second supports the longer 24 day surface stay when the\ncrew is housed in the Habitat Module (HM). The third period begins with permanent\noccupancy and stay periods of 180 days.\n5.3.1\n\nEight Day Stay Logistic Operations\n\nFor 8 day surface stay, the logistics philosophy is similar to the Apollo and Space Shuttle\napproaches. Al critical life support systems are designed and built to be fail operational/fail\nl\nsafe. These will have redundancy so no spares are required. Consumables are on board\nfor the planned duration of the mission plus a contingency period.\n\nM n m l consumables and spares are shipped for the 8 day stay missions which are carried\niia\nwithin the habitable volume. During Apollo only a small tool kit and minor spares such\nas fuses were on board. For Shuttle the equipment for inflight maintenance does not\nexceed 91 kg (200 Ibs). A general purpose computer, 43 kg. (95 Ibs.), tool kit, 31 kg,\n(67 lbs.), fuses, and a vacuum cleaner are in the pressurized volume of the Shuttle. In\nthe lunar Personnel Transfer Module a tool kit and minimum spares will be available.\nSpares will be determined after an analysis of system redundancy, reliability and repair\nfeasibility.\n5.3.2\n\nTwenty-four Day Stay Logistic Operations\n\nFor 24 day stay time missions, gradual delivery of supplies and spares will be provided\nwhen excess launch mass and volume is available. Because of the remoteness of the\nlunar base, a minimum supply of spares or pre-positioned LRUs must be available by the\n24 day lunar missions. Appendix A lists the excess payload launch capability by mission\nwhich may be utilized to deliver the spares. Unused supplies will be left on the lunar\nsurface. A tool kit and minimum spares will be available. The spares inventory will be\nincreased gradually according to a prioritized list of critical LRUs. For failures of\nlunar equipment for which no spares are available and for which repairs are possible, re-\n\n8\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nplacement parts will be delivered on the next mission. The approximate intervals between\nthe manned missions is 90 days. The Lunar Base equipment reliability must be sufficiently\nhigh to meet this operational time interval. This is similar to procedures followed to\nrespond to failures on Skylab. During Skylab, only a tool kit was available. For major\nfailures, replacement parts were carried up with the crew on the following flight.\n\n5.3.3\n\n180 Day Stay Logistics Operations\n\nFor 180 day missions, bulk delivery of consumables and spares will be made i the logistics\nn\nmodule and with the crews. Major logistics module deliveries are needed to sustain the\nlonger surface stay times.\n\n6.0 Trade Studies\nThree basic trade studies are performed in this task. They are the (1) crew size trade\nto evaluate the impact of crew size on base operations and transportation systems, (2)\nsurface stay time trade to assess the impact of extending crew stay times above those\nindicated in the baseline, and (3) packaging and handling options for spares, equipment,\nand consumables to identify the preferred method of handling supply materials for the\nLunar Base.\n\n6.1\n\nCrew Size Trade\n\nA trade study of the size of the Lunar Base crew was performed to determine the impact\nof crew size on the various elements of the Lunar Base. A baseline crew of four was\nchosen and crew sizes of 5 , 6, 7, and 8 were investigated. The advantages of increasing\n\nthe crew size was compared to the mass, volume, and consumables impact on the Personnel\nTransfer Module, Habitat Module and supporting transportation infrastructure.\n\n6.1.1\n\nApproach\n\nFirst the functions and requirements of the baseline crew are identified. Next the\nadvantage of each additional crew member was determined in terms of skills, increased\nshift capability, increased crew time available, and increased EVA and IVA support capability.\nEach of the delta impacts for additional crew members were tabulated in terms of volume\nand mass increases necessary to support an additional crewmember. When all of the\nsubcomponent volume impacts were determined, then the required volume of the module\nwas determined. From this a delta volume and mass of the pressure vessel and substructure\nwas calculated. With t i mass added to the subcomponent mass, the total mass impact\nhs\nfor increased crew size was determined. As a fiial summary, the advantages of the\nvarious crew sizes were compared against the disadvantages.\n\n6.1.2\n\nBaseline Crew Functions\n\nThe baseline crew has to perform several functions in the total mission cycle of a Lunar\nBase mission. One of the main functions is to pilot the Lunar O W and LanderLauncher\nfrom low Earth orbit to the Moon and return. The other main function is to construct\nthe Lunar Base and to perform scientific and geological experiments while on the surface.\nThe specific functions that must be performed are those of a Pilot, Flight Engineer,\nMedical Officer, Technician, and Lunar Specialist. During the flight to and from the Moon,\nthe functions of the Pilot, and Flight Engineer are critical. Once on the Moon, the\nfunctions of the Lunar Specialist becomes more important. The subcategories of the\n\n9\n\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nLunar Specialist include those of Lunar construction engineer, Lunar Base manager, systems\nengineer, geologist, biologist, materials scientist, physicist, and astronomer. In both\nphases, at least one crewmember must be designated as the Medical Officer. To accomplish\nthis with a crew of four, considerable crosstraining is necessary. Maintenance, servicing,\nand repair functions needed for the equipment located on the lunar surface must also be\nconsidered.\nA list of crew skills and specialties are tabulated in Table 2 to compare the skill and\nspecialty needs as a function of mission number as the Lunar Base is being developed.\nThe term specialty is being used in the context of career specialty while the term skill\nis used to defiie a function a person can be trained to do in a short period of t h e .\nFrom the table, we can see that the requirement for crosstraining builds up rather\nrapidly as the base is being developed. It may not be reasonable to require any crewperson\nto have a background in more than two career specialties. Multiple skills, however, can\nbe handled by each crewperson since skills can be acquired after a short training period.\nIn Table 3 the skills and specialties were compared to the operational functions that\nwould be performed to develop the Lunar Base.\n\n6.1.3\n\nOptional Crew Size Functions\n\nEven with a larger crew size, separate flight and surface crews cannot be allowed. The\nlarger crew size permits more crew hours for surface operations and a better mix of\nspecialties becomes available. As the crew size is increased, the primary functions of\nPilot and Flight Engineer are retained. For those flights not having a physician crewmember, an individual would be trained to be the Medical Officer. Each of the flight\ncrew would still be trained in specialty fields to support operations on the lunar surface\nas shown in Table 3.\n6.1.4\n\nNumber of Crew Shifts\n\nThe number of crew shifts for the baseline crew size of four is either one with all\ncrewmembers active during the work period or two with one half of the crew active\nduring each work period. In either case, the total number of crew hours available\nduring a 24 hour period remains the same. The advantage of having all crewmembers\nactive during a work period is for those tasks which may be labor intensive for a short\nduration of time. The advantage of two shifts is for those tasks which are continuous\nactivities requiring some participation by a crewmember over a long span of time. The\npossible combinations of the number of shifts compared with crew size is shown in\nTable 4.\nIt is anticipated that for the early phase of the Lunar Base construction effort, that the\none shift per 24 hour period approach may be preferred to support labor intensive tasks\nua\non the lunar surface. After the L n r Base is well established, the preference will\nprobably change to two shifts to support continuous operations. After the base is permanently occupied and the available crew size grows, the preference would be to support\na three shift operation for maximum support of lunar activities. A comparison of the\nnumber of 8 hour shifts available within a 24 hour period as a function of crew size is\nshown in Table 4.\n\n10\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nTABLE 2\nCREW SKILLS/SPECIALTIESVS MISSIONS\n\nSKILLS\nBasc Managcr/Commandcr\nElectronics Tech\nAerospacc/MechnnicalTech\nEmergency Medical Tach\nSuit Technician\nHousekeeping Services\nH a y Equipment Operator\nev\nInstrument Technician\nPhoto Technician\nChem Lab Technician\n\nMISSION NO. 2 4 6 9 11 13 16 18 20 22 26 30 31 32 34 36 38 39 42 44 46 47\n\nx x x\nx\nx\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nX\nx\nx x x x x x\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx x x x x x x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x x\nx x x\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx x x x x x x x\nx\nx x\nx x x\nx x\nx x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nSPECIALTIES\nPilot\nFlight Engineer\nGeologist\nPlanetologist\nPhysicist\nGeochemist\nMiftobiologist\nPlant Biologist\nPhy sician/Aerospace Medicine\nA.&onomer\nCivil Engincu\nElectrical Engineer\nAerospace Engineer\n\nX\n\nx x x x\nx\nx\nx\n\n11\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx x\nx x\nx x\n\nTABLE 3\nCREW SKILLS/SPECIAL,TIES VS FUNCTIONS\n\nSKIUS\n\nFUNCTION NO\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10111213141516\n\nx x x\nx\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\nx x\nx x\nx x\n\nBase Managea/Commander\nElectronics Tech\neh\nAcrospacc/McchanicalT c\nEmergency Medical Tech\nSuit Technician\nHousekeeping Seavices\nHeavy Equipment Operator\nInstrument Technician\nPhoto Technician\nChem Lab Technician\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx x x x x x x\nx\nx x x x x x x\nx x x x x x x\nx x\nx x x x x x x\nx x\nx\nx\nx x\n\nx x\nx x x\nx\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\nx x\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\nX\n\nSPECIALTIES\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nPilot\nFlight Engineer\nGeologist\nplanetologist\nphysicist\nGeochemist\nMicrobiologist\nPlant Biologist\nPhysician/Aerospace Medicine\nAstronomer\nCivil Engineer\nElectrical Engineer\nAerospace Engineer\n\nx x\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nx x\nX\n\nx x\n\nx x x\nX\nX\n\nX\n\nx x x x\nx x x\nx x x x x\n\nFUNCTIONS\n1 Earth/Moon Transportation\n2 Landing Site Preparation\n\n3 Lunar Base Assembly\n4 Pilot Power Plant Assembly and Operation\n5 Lunar Base operation\n\n6 Lunar Science and Field Geology\n7 ocochanical Mataids Laboratory Operation\n8 Pilot Oxygen Plant Assembly and Operation\n9 Life Science Research\n10 Optical Interferometer Telescope Operation\n11 Cmtex Dating Experiment Operation\n12 Deep hilling opaation\n13 Advanced Power Plant operation\n14 Oxygen Mining Operations\n15 Oxygen Production Plant Operation\n16 Lunar Base Maintenance\n\n12\n\nI\n\nx x\nx x\n\nx x\n\nx x\nx\nx\n\nx x\nX\n\nx\n\nx\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nTABLE 4\nLUNAR BASE CREW FUNCTIONS\n\ncrew Size\n\nC e Function(1)\nrw\n\nSMS(2)\n\nCrew\nlShift\nHrs/Day EVMhift(3)\n\n2 Sit\nhf\n\nEVMhift(3)\n\n3 Sit\nhf\nEVmhift(3)\n\nEVA\nHrGDays(4)\n\n4\n\nP?FE,ZLS\n\nlor2\n\n32\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2\n\nNA\n\n72\n\n5\n\nP?FE9Ls\n\n1 or2\n\n40\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2o 3\nr\n\nNA\n\n90\n\n6\n\nPFE.4Ls\n\n12o3\n..r\n\n48\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2\n\n108\n\n7\n\nP?FEJLS\n\n12o3\n..r\n\n56\n\n23o4\n..r\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2or3\n\n126\n\n8\n\nP?FE,6LS\n\n12o3\n,,r\n\n64\n\n2,3,or4\n\n2304\n..r\n\n2,3,or4\n\n144\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nCrew Functions- P pilot, FE Flight Engineer.

For those items located within the pressurized habitable\nvolume, mass and volume values were assigned and tabulated. Once all of the discreet\nitems associated with an incremental growth in crew size of one crewmember were identified,\nan estimate for the environmental control and life support subsystem increase per crewa\nmember w s assigned the volume of 20 cu. ft.(.566 cubic meters) and 220 Ib. (100 kg.)\nmass. These delta increases in equipment volume and mass were taken from Space Station\nstudies (Ref. 2 and 7) where various crew sizes were evaluated.\nThe CNDB mass allotment for the crew and crew equipment is insufficient to include the\nEMU. It is recommended that the estimated EMU mass of 136 kg. (300 Ib.) be added\nto the CNDB weight statement to support later study efforts with a more accurate amount\nfor crew and crew equipment masses.\nAn increase in the EVA support equipment is required when the crew size exceeds six.\nThis is due to the limitation of the proposed suit servicing equipment to support service\nof two EVA suits and equipment within a 12 hour period. The total volume increase of\nthe previous items were summed to determine the module volume growth necessary to\naccommodate an additional crewmember. This volume change then relates to an incremental\nchange in the length of the module for a constant diameter of 166 in. (4.22 meters).\nAssociated with the module length change an estimated value of 315 Ib./ft. (469.2 kg.\nper meter) of module length was assigned for pressure vessel and supporting structure\ndelta weight impact. This information was taken from data on Space Station Common\nModule weight estimates for various length modules. These delta mass impacts were\nsummed with the consumables located outside the pressurized volume to determine the total\nmass impact to increase the crew size. These items are summarized in Table 5 .\n\nThe impacts cited above will be directly reflected in the mass and volume required for\nthe Personnel Transfer Module. If the Habitat Module is sized for a growth crew of\neight, no impact will be felt until the period when a permanently manned base takes\nplace. With the 180 day stay mission, if it is assumed that the crew will double to a\neight, then additional measures will have to be provided at the Lunar Base to accoinmodate\nthe larger crew. With the Lunar Base designed for long term growth, it is expected\nthat an additional Habitat Module would be delivered to the lunar surface to accommodate\nany crew number increase. This inclusion would require the addition of a dedicated\nmission to deliver the Habitat Module to the lunar surface or resizing the Habitat Module.\nThe CNDB indicates that the Habitat Module is presently sized to support a crew of six.\nIn summary, mass penalty per unit crew added is linear until the limits of large pieces\nof hardware, such as the Habitat Module or suit servicing equipment is reached. Then\nlarge penalties occur for extra crew.\n6.1.6\n\nCrew Size Benefit Comparison\n\nThe baseline crew size of four provides the necessary crew to accomplish the mission\nobjectives with a minimum of weight and volume impact. The option to select either\none or two shift operation is another advantage of a four crewmember complement.\nThe primary disadvantage of four crew is the limited amount of crew time available to\nperform useful tasks on the lunar surface.

Each additional crew member made 8 hours of crew time per day\navailable to perform EVA and IVA tasks on the lunar surface. A significant penalty\ncame with the addition of the seventh and eighth crew members which required the\naddition of EVA servicing equipment to allow for EVA operation by the additional crew\nmembers. A summary of these advantages and disadvantages are shown in Table 6.\n\n6. I .7\n\nRecommended Crew Size\n\nIf total mass delivered to the lunar surface must be minimized, then the baseline crew\nsize of four is the best option. Lunar surface operation would simply have to be tailored\nto stay within the constraints of available crew time and support capabilities. This\nwould require a certain degree of automation of Lunar Base construction activities,\nteleoperation capabilities from the IVA crew, and support of operations from Earth. If\nthe maximum degree of operational flexibility is desired with the minimum weight penalty,\nthe crew size of six provides this capability. With a crew size of six, the capability to\ndo three shift operations exists and the maximum EVA support capability can be met\nwithout a major impact on the EVA support equipment.\nIt is also recommended that the CNDB weight statement for crew and equipment mass\nbe increased by 136 kg.(300 lb.) to account for the mass of an EMU for each crewmember.\n\n6.2\n\nSurface Stay Time Trade\n\nA trade study of the lunar surface stay time was performed to determine the impact of\nduration of lunar surface stay time on operations and support capabilities. A baseline\ncrew of four was chosen for all of the stay times evaluated. The stay times that were\nevaluated were 8, 24, and 180 days. These times were baselined in the CNDB (Ref. 1).\nIn addition, the optional stay times of 11 and 42 days were evaluated to determine the\nbenefits and disadvantages of the di\xe2\x82\xacferent durations.\n\n6.2.1\n\nApproach\n\nThe approach taken in this activity w s to start with the baseline crew size of four and\na\nidentify support requirements necessary to allow the crew to stay on the lunar surface\nfor increasing periods of time. Once these factors were identified, then the impact of\neach support requirement was tabulated as a function of surface stay time.\nOne factor that was not addressed was the issue of Earth-Moon orbital mechanics of\nwindows of opportunity for orbital rendezvous. Opportunities to depart from the Space\nStation orbit to the lunar vicinity and to depart lunar orbit for the Space Station orbit\noccur at roughly 9 day intervals, the interval between the times the Space Station orbit\nplane contains the Moon. The posigrade motion of the Moon and the retrograde precession\nof the Space Station orbit cause this interval. It can be adjusted somewhat by changing\nthe altitude, and therefore the precession rate of the low Earth orbit. Changes to the\nintervals and windows of opportunity are possible, usually at the expense of propellant.\nAs the stay times and other parameters are varied from optimum values, required propellant\n16\n\n2\n\n.d\n\nB\n3\n\nQ\n\n.5\n\nquantities slowly then rapidly increase. This investigation was considered out of scope\nfor this task. It is however an important factor concerning lunar surface stay thes.\nAfter all of the support requirements have been identified, the stay times were checked\nfor operational constraints such as landing time, frequency of EVA, designated rest\nperiods, lighting considerations, night cycle operations, and launch preparation constraints.\nWith these conditions considered, the total available time for surface operations was\ncalculated and the amount of allowable EVA time was subtracted to determine the amount\nof IVA time available during the surface stay time. Based on the results of the evaluation,\nrecommendations were made regarding the preferred surface stay times.\n\n6.2.2\n\nGuidelines and Assumptions\n\nThe assumptions used in this trade were developed from Space Station studies (Ref. 2)\nand experience gained from the Apollo Lunar missions. Listed below are the significant\nassumptions affecting this trade:\n\n0\n\nSpace Station developed guidelines\n\n-\n\n0\n\n-\n\nBaseline crew size is four\nLunar night EVA may occur between 1/4 earthlight and 3/4 earthlight\n\nTask developed guidelines\n\n-\n\n6.2.3\n\nEVA will be accomplished with a minimum of two crewpersons\nEVA duration is 6 hours nominal\nEach crewperson will not exceed 3 EVAs per a 7 day period\n\nNASA provided guidelines\n\n0\n\nAn 8 hour work day is assumed for each crewperson\n\nThree hours of IVA time is required to support each EVA\nAllowances were not made for holidays, weekends, eclipses, or solar flares\nLocation of Lunar Base is at Lacus Veris (13\' S , 87.5\' W)\nLunar departure at lunar night is possible\nLunar landing will occur during lunar daytime\n\nSupport Requirements\n\nThe items required to support extended stay on the lunar surface are crew habitation\naccommodations, crew consumables, spares, and lighting conditions. For the 8 and 11\nday surface stay times, the crew lived out of the Personnel Transfer Module. The consumables were originally calculated on a crew day basis and extended to match the\nvarious stay times evaluated in this task. Lighting constraints considered in this task\nwere allowances for landing conditions, daylight surface operations and nighttime surface\noperations. The nighttime Operations constraint of operations between 1/4 earthlight\nand 314 earthlight is based on the minimum amount of illumination needed from the crew\nto allow color discrimination. Nighttime operations wl be limited to activities in the\nil\nimmediate area of the Lunar Base for reasons of safety.\n\n18\n\n6.2.4\n\nOperational Crew Time Availability\n\nThe amount of crew time available for useful work on the lunar surface was calculated\nfrom the total amount of productive hours available from the crew during their stay on\nthe lunar surface. With any given stay time duration, the available periods for EVA\nactivities were determined using all of the constraints placed on EVA operations. With\nthe number of EVA opportunities identified, the total number of useful EVA hours were\ncalculated. The six hours per EVA is based on the time elapsed between depressurized\nairlock opening and airlock closure for repressurization. It is estimated that an additional\nhour might be lost during EVA for equipment and tool gathering in the beginning and\nequipment storage and dust removal at the end of the EVA. This time is not considered\nin the tabulated results but is addressed in the Surface Missions Operations Task 4.1.\nWith each EVA, approximately three hours are required in preparations and servicing\nwhich must be deducted from the total crew hours available. The total crew hours\nminus the total EVA hours with its associated preparatory time is the IVA hours available\nduring the lunar surface stay. These results are shown in Table 7.\nFactors which may inhibit the actual amount of useful EVA on the lunar surface which\nwere not considered in t i trade were crew fatigue levels, lighting conditions, and the\nhs\neffect of temperatures cycles on the equipment.\nThe schedule of three EVAs per crew per week may be optimistic for long duration\nmissions. Since data of this nature is not available, the amount of time available for\nEVA is given for a relative comparison purpose.\nThe lighting and thermal conditions at lunar noon were not considered since the crew\nrest period for EVA activities happened to coincide with lunar noon for the site and\nlanding time evaluated.\nThe third factor, the temperature of the surface during lunar night, may be partially\not\nresolved by design of the equipment. Since m s of the operating equipment generates\nsome heat, the thermal design of the equipment may use this to maintain critical equipment within its thermal operating limits. For passive equipment, thermal embrittlement\nmay be a significant problem.\n\n6.2.5\n\nSurface Stay Time Comparison\n\nThere were two comparisons of surface stay time, short and medium. The first is the\ncomparison of the 8 day stay time verses the 11 day stay time while the crew is operating\nfrom.the Personnel Transfer Module. The second is the comparison between the baseline\n24 day stay time and 42 day stay time while the crew is operating from the Habitat\nModule in the Lunar Base. Consumables, spares, surface lighting constraints, crew fatigue\nand orbital mechanics are the primary factors. Increasing the surface stay time provides\nmore time to perform useful construction and science activities on the lunar surface.\nIn the comparison between the 8 day and 11 day surface stay times, only 51.1 kg. (112.5\nlbs.) of additional consumables for the crew of four provided three extra days of surface\nstay time. If landing occurred early in the lunar day, the lighting conditions allow\nuseful activity for the full duration of the extended stay period of 11 days. The location\nof the landing site combined with the rest period after 3 EVA\xe2\x80\x99S per crewmember coincided\nwith lunar noon which minimized problems associated with thermal and shadow visibility\nconsiderations. For the cost of consurnables, it appears advantageous to extend the stay\n\n19\n\nB\nI\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\n3\n\nI\n\n8\nm\nm\n9\n\n8\n\n0\n\\o\n\nm\n\n4\n\n4\n\nI\nI\nI\n1\n1\nt\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nm\n\nB\n\n4\n\nI\nI\n\na\nI\n\nI\n\nu\n\n00\n\ntime to gain crew time to perform surface operations. The short difference in stay\ntimes should not cause significant problems in habitability considerations.\nFor the comparison between the 24 day and 42 day stay times, consumables and lunar\nnight conditions enter as factors restricting the duration of useful EVA. The advantage\nof considering the 42 day stay time is that two lunar days of surface operations can be\naccomplished on a single mission for the cost of consumables. With landing occurring\nearly in the lunar day, the limit of EVA operation is reached at approximately 22 days\ndue to surface lighting constraints during lunar night. This surface lighting constraint\nis site dependent and applies to the site selected for this study. At this point, it is assumed\nthat the additional time during lunar night will be occupied with IVA activities. If it is\nelected to extend the Surface stay time to 42 days, then additional consumables amounting\nto 306.5 kg. (675 lbs.) must be added to provide the extended stay capability.\nIn both groups of comparisons, it was assumed that the water loop was 97% closed and\nthe CO, loop was regenerative. Crew fatigue and transportation orbital mechanics have\nnot been factored into the considerations.\n\n6.2.6\n\nSurface Stay Time Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the baseline stay times of 8 days and 24 days be retained at the\nstart of each operational period because of the indeterminate factor of crew fatigue\nfrom EVA activities. After experience has been gained from each initial mission, determination of crew capability on the lunar surface can be better evaluated for future\nmissions. If the experience indicates that crew fatigue is not a problem, then on subsequent\nmissions the small amount of consumables required should be added to allow for extension\nof surface stay time. In addition, this task should be reevaluated after detailed analysis\nof transportation orbital mechanics has been performed.\n6.3 Supply Options Trade\nThe supply options trade study investigated the packaging and handling options and the\nrequired mass for spares, consumables, and equipment to support the supply of the Lunar\nBase. The items that were evaluated were the nature of the supply item, usage location,\nstorage requirements, environmental requirements, size, and packaging requirements.\n\n6.3.1\n\nLogistics Assumptions\n\nThe following assumptions are used in developing the logistics concepts and calculating\nmass and volume requirements:\n1.\n\nFor life support, food, personal hygiene and clothes, 4.04 kg. (8.9 lb.) /person/day\nwas assumed. This is rounded up to 136 kg. (300 lb.) for an 8 day lunar surface\nrm\nstay time. These numbers are f o the NASA Civil Needs Data Base (Ref. 1).\nT i number was checked in our detailed calculations of supply mass requirements.\nhs\n\n2.\n\nSpares are built up at a rate of 10% of the mass of permanent habitable modules\nand equipment delivered to the surface of the moon. The 10% rate was derived\nfrom an analysis of spares requirements for the Space Station. The masses for the\nSpace Station LRUs in the airlock, habitation module and a node were summed.\nAssuming one replacement unit was carried to the Space Station for each LRU, the\nspares mass equaled 10% of the total mass of the airlock, habitation module and a\n21\n\nnode. Because of the similar remoteness of the Lunar Base, the 10% mass of the\ntotal delivered payload mass was used.\n\n3. A stowage and logistics system compatible with the Space Station will be used.\nStandard racks will be used in the Habitation and Logistics Modules. Stowage containers\nwill be similar or identical to the Space Station stowage containers.\n4. The reuseable Personnel Transfer Module will be maintained at the Space Station.\nThe vehicle maintenance facilities, equipment, and personnel will already be available\nat the Space Station for maintaining other vehicles such as the Orbital Transfer\nVehicle. Before taking the Personnel Transfer Module to the lunar surface, a maintenance\ncycle will be performed to maximize crew safety and mission success. Maintenance\nat the Space Station saves the weight penalty of transporting maintenance equipment\nand supplies to the lunar surface.\n\n5. Some failed equipment which can not be repaired on the Moon or at LEO will be\nretuned to the E r h if desired for failure analysis. If the equipment can be dismantled\nat\nand faulty components identified, only the failed component will be returned. The\nil\nrest wl remain on the Moon in a Reprocessing Depository (RD) for future repair\nparts or recycling of materials.\n\nTrades studies will have to be done to determine if it i cheaper to fx broken parts\ns\ni\nor replace them. Since crew time is an expensive commodity, the weight to supply\nparts or new equipment will be traded against the weight and cost to provide crew\nrepair hours.\n\n6. Al supply materials not used as scheduled will be stored on the Moon to build up\nl\nthe supply inventory. Therefore, shielding or storage facilities will be needed at a\nvery early stage. A logging and tracking system will also be needed for inventory\ncontrol.\n\n632\n..\n\nDetailed Mass Calculations for Manned Missions\n\nThe information in Table 8 represents supply mass tabulation by mission for the mission\nscenario developed in Appendix A as well as detailed calculations made from the data\nt\nprovided a the beginning of this task. The top rows contain information on the year\nof the flight, mission number, number of crew, and the days of surface stay time.\nDirectly below are the mass of equipment delivered to the lunar surface and an estimate\nof the required mass for spares. The next group of information contains the CNDB\nvalues for consumables mass.\nThe mass required for each manned mission was developed in two ways. First, the CNDB\nlists the mass by crew person and base support requirements. Second, using consumables\nas\nrequirements developed for Space Station (Ref. 2), a m s summary was developed.\nTable 8 shows the consumables required for each manned mission. For crew consumables,\n4.04 kg (8.9 lb) rperSon/day was assumed. This is rounded up to 136 kg (300 lb) for\nan 8 day lunar surface stay time. These numbers are from the NASA Civil Needs Data\nBase (Ref. 1). These numbers were verified with the "Manned Mars Mission, Working Group\nPapers" (Ref. 4) guidelines for ECLSS Average Design Loads given in Table 9.\n\n22\n\n0\nm\n0\n\nw\n\nd\n\nz*dN\n\nx,\nw\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\ngg 8\nN\n\nI\n-\n\n;\nd\n\nI\n\n--\n\nm\n\n9\nQ\n\nI\n-\n\nm m\n\nz>\n\nI\n4\n-\n\nw\n\nM7\n\n8\nV\n4\n\nF\n\n2s\n\n8\nI\n\nm\n\nm\n\n2\n\n.\n\n4\n\n"\nF!\n6\n\nN\nVI\n\n2\n\ne\n\nc\n\ni\n?\n\nI\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\n~\n\nTABLE 9.

Spares are\ncalculated as a percent of functional surface mass buildup. For example, the functional\nsurface mass buildup by Mission 2 includes an unpressurized rover 1,814 kg.(4,000 lbs)\nand landing instrumentation/beacons 907 kg. (2,000 Ibs.). Ten percent of the total mass\nof 2,721 kg. (6,000 lbs.) is required for spares which is 272 kg. (600 lbs). The 10%\nrate of spares buildup was based on Space Station analyses of work package 1 spares\nrequirements. For the lab module, habitation module, pressurized and unpressurized\nlogistics carriers, airlocks and nodes, 693 LRU\xe2\x80\x99s were identified. These occupy approximately\n27 cu. m. (960 cu. f. with packaging and have an average density of 320 kg./cu.m. (20\nt)\nThis totals 8,709 kg. (19,200 lbs.). The total mass of the work package\nlbs./cu. fi.).\nmodules is 88,961 kg. (196,122 lbs.). To provide spares, 10% of the mass is needed.\nSpares will be supplied for the LRUs, equipment, and subsystems. Occasionally, for\nunplanned and unpredicted failures for which no spares exist on the lunar surface, parts\nmay be shipped on manned or unmanned missions having excess mass and volume payload\ncapability. This will be done in a manner similar to the Skylab repair methods (Ref. 8\n& 9).\n\nThe group of data entitled Crew Life Support, are the detailed calculations which were\ndeveloped from the input groundrules and assumptions at the start of this task. Preliminary\ncalculations for ECLSS water usage, which are not included, indicated that with a 97%\nefficient water recovery system, the makeup water from the food canceled out any\nlosses due to non-recoverable waste water. For safety, however, contingency water\nshouid be delivered early to the lunar surface and stored in the safe haven in the event\nthat water closure cannot be achieved either through an accident or by low efficiencies\nof water recovery.\nThe data listed under EVA represents those losses due to suit efficiencies and non-recoverable atmosphere losses from the airlock and pressurized garage.\nAll of the consumables and spares were tabulated and an appropriate factor included for\npackaging and tankage for results which are listed directly below the bare consumable\nmass values. One variation that was made to the data in the tables for the data presented\nin Appendix A was the distribution of supply mass on the last four manned missions.\nThis was done to evaluate the capability of the model to keep the consumables on the\nsame vehicle as the crew.\n\nFigure 1 is a graphic plot of the data presented in Table 8. Figure 1 indicates how the\nconsumables and spares mass compare to lander capacity and normal payloads. The\nlanded payload mass on the lunar surface was plotted against the mission number for\nfour cases. The horizontal line at 17,464 kg. (38,500 Ib.) represents the maximum delivery\ncapacity of the lander stage. The cases plotted were (1) payload mass with the Appendix\nA CNDB values for consumables, (2) payload mass without any consumables or spares, (3)\npayload mass with the trade study calculated consumables and packaging mass, and (4)\npayload mass with trade study calculated consumables, spares and packaging mass. The\nlast plot may be the most accurate representation of actual landed mass.\n\n6.3.3\n\nPackaging and Handling Trade Options\n\nThe supply packaging and handling trades concern the transfer of supplies to the lunar\nsurface and the surface stowage method.\n25\n\n26\n\nFour alternatives exist for transferring the supplies to the lunar surface. First the\nPersonnel Transfer Module can be sized to accommodate consumables and spares for\ninternal stowage. Second, external provisions could be attached to the Personnel Transfer\nModule for storage of spares and consumables. Third, the Expendable Lunar Lander can\nbe fitted to transport Space Station compatible stowage racks.\nFourth, a dedicated\nlogistics module can be transported.\nFor surface stowage, several alternatives are possible. First the existing Lunar Base\nmodules can be used. Second, a small module can be developed with pieces which lock\ntogether on the lunar surface. Third, shielded unpressurized stowage under the Expendable\nLunar Lander can be used.\nThe storage container design must accommodate pressurized and unpressurized stowage,\nliquids, gases, and cryogenics. It must support the return of scientific samples and\nproducts and failed equipment. It must also provide stowage for waste products which\nmay become future recyclable resources.\nThe logistics container and module design should be Space Station compatible (Ref. 10).\nSince the Space Station will be the transfer point for supplies and a source for additional\nrush supplies when time does not pennit delivery from the Earth, the use of the standard\nil\nrack wl simplify loading and transfer of supplies.\n\nI?E S ~ Z Cti^^? ?X~EELT~! gentr~td=yeid coiii&iei designs {Ref. i I j . ~ n e s e\n~\nI\n=\ninclude Shuttle-type drawers with net covering, frames with pockets and inflatable air\nbladders between frames, honeycomb matrjx containers, carousel drawers with sliding\ntambour doors and triangular bins. A rack has approximately 1.93 cu. m. (68 cu. ft.) of\nstowage volume. The stowage container efficiency ranges from 54% to 81% of the pressurized\ncontainer volume.\nm\n.\n\nThe supplies can be stored in pressurized and unpressurized facilities. For all missions,\na two week supply of food wl always be in the pressurized module as a minimum.\nil\nFood, crew equipment and spares can be stored in short and long term stowage in pressurized\nand unpressurized containers.\nThe Expendable Lunar Lander can be designed with beta cloth shades to be attached and\ndeployed on the lunar surface. Unpressurized, sheltered stowage will be appropriate\nfor tanks of liquids, gases and cryogenics. Dy goods and equipment can be stored in\nr\nvacuum sealed packages and also left in a sheltered storage area.\nAll materials carried to the Moon will be expensive to lift from the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface.\nil\nTherefore, a Reprocessing Depot (RD) wl be needed for dry trash, brine, human waste\nand other solids. The RD must be located in an environmentally acceptable place. It\nmust be within convenient access, not visually unsightly, and not blocking access to\nlunar resources. Materials stored must not pollute the lunar environment.\nItems stored at the RD should be separated and stored depending on possible future\nuse. Based on solid waste estimates from Space Station, .044 cu. m. (1.548 cu. ft.) of\nwaste will be generated per day for a four person crew. The density is 116.6 kg,/cu. m.\n(7.28 Ibs./cu. ft.).\nAfter compaction, the density is estimated to be 416.5 kg./cu. m. (26\nlbs./cu. ft.) (Ref. 2). Dry trash wl be stored within the habitable areas of the lunar\nil\nstation for up to seven days then transferred to a temporary unpressurized external\nholding area and finally transported to a RD.\n27\n\n6.3.4\n\nSupply Module Design Considerations\n\nFrom the results of the investigation, it became apparent that several distinct categories\nof packaging and handing requirements exist to support the transportation and distribution\nof consumables, spares, and equipment to the lunar surface. Supply of the Lunar Base\nduring the frt two periods with stay durations of eight to twenty-four days should be\nis\naccomplished by utilizing space in the Personnel Transfer Module and the Lander bays.\n\nThis is possible with the excess payload capacity available on the manned missions. The\nrequired total landed for 180 day missions mass exceeds the capability of the lander\nhowever. Based on this, the spares can be spread over all of the missions as shown in\nFigure 1 or a dedicated supply flight to provide the necessary consumables and spares\nfor a planned period of time can be flown.\nPercentage estimates for tankage and packaging on each class of item, and item masses\nresult in an estimated supply mass for 180 day missions. The tankage and packaging\nfactors utilized are 20% for liquids, 50% for solids, and 100% for gasses (Ref. 12). Summing\nthe total supply requirements (spares and consumables) for the last four manned missions,\nproduces a total mass of 19,531 kg. (43,058 Ibs.).\nThe total liquid and gas masses for the last four missions for module leakage and EVA\nactivities (without tankage) are 3,814 kg. (8,408 lb.). Delivery of all the consumables\nnnA mm-ae $0 ~qjpfi\nuy-w\n&e LA m B m fer p ~ +;~a\n-n\nr f?\n\'\nZQ~\npr~<ic$ QZ p e ~ & i ~ ) r ? 1\n.:\nis assumed that some of the consumables and a limited amount of critical spares identified\nbetween missions will be delivered with the manned missions. An estimate of 20% of\nthe total mass calculated for two years of consumables and spares is assigned for delivery\nwith the manned missions. Since 20% of this mass is to be delivered with the manned\nmissions, the remaining liquid and gas m a s that must be delivered with the Logistics\nModule is 3,052 kg. (6,726\nlb.).\n. .\ny"\n\nThe sum of the ECLSS consumables and general spares with their packaging weight, is\n13,548 kg. (29,868 lbs.). With the delivery of 20% of this mass on the manned missions,\nthe amount remaining to be delivered on the Logistics Module is 10,838 kg. (23,894 lbs.).\n\nGiven the above values for mass of consumables and spares, a logistics module having\nan overall length of 5.66 meters (18.6 fi.) and an empty mass of 4,053 kg. (8,936 lb.)\ncould accommodate the items and still provide space for crew access and support equipment.\nSimilar calculations resulted in a liquid tankage module having a length of 2.2 meters\n(7.2 ft.) and a empty mass of 1,525 kg. (3,363 Ibs.). To accommodate items not requiring\npressurized storage which will not fit inside the module, pallets similar to those used by\nthe Space Lab may be adequate. These modules are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3.\nThe masses of the modules were derived from designs developed for the Space Station\nand the Spacelab (Ref.3, 13, & 14). The referenced modules were designed to be flown\non the Shuttle and have to meet the launch and landing loads experienced during operations.\nAs a consequence, the design is conservative when applied to the Lunar Base. The\nincorporation of lighter materials for the Modules and repackaging at the Space Station\nfor the lunar transportation environment will probably reduce the mass of the modules\nand improve the payload mass fraction delivered to the lunar surface.\nMost of the consumables with the exception of the liquids and gasses, should be stored\ninside a pressurized volume to allow the base crew shirtsleeve access to the consumables\nand spares. Standard docking hatches should be provided on both ends of the module to\n28\n\nI\nI\nD\n1\nI\n\nLogistics Supply Module\nm\n\nb--3.7\n\n12.2ft\n\n-+\n\n8\n1\n1\nI\n1\n\nModule Length\n\n5.7 m\n18.6 ft\n\n1\n\nStructure and\nHardware Mass\n3,525 K\ng\n7,771 Ibs\n\nSubsystems\n\nPayload\n\nTotal Mass\n\n528 K\ng\n1,165 Ibs\n\n10,838 K\ng\n23,894 Ibs\n\n14,891 K\ng\n32,830 Ibs\n\nFluid Shipping Module\n\nI\n8\n8\n\nt\n\nCyrogenic Tanks\n(Typical 4 Places)\nLiquid Tanks\n(Typical 8 Places)\n\n4.42m\n\n14.5 ft\n\n1\n\nI\n1\n\nInterface Connectors\n\n8 I Module Length 1 Struct.\n\nMass Subsystems Cry0 & Liquids\n\nTotal Mass\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n2.2 m\n7.2ft\n\n305 K\ng\n673 Ibs\n\n1,220 K\ng\n2,690 Ibs\n\nFigure 2\n29\n\n3,051 K\ng\n6,726 Ibs\n\n10,089 Ibs\n4,576 Kg\n\n1\n\nLogistics Module Pallets\n\n11 .\n-4\n5\n\n4.42 m\nft\n\n-\n\n\':\nI\n\n1\n\nModule Length\n2.88 m\n9.4 ft\n5.76 m\n18.0 ft\n8.64 m\n28.2 ft\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n\n1\n\nStruct Mass\n\n816Kg\n1,800 Ibs\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1632 Kg\n3,600 Ibs\n\nPayload\n\n3110 Kg\n6,856 Ibs\n\nI\n\nTotal\n\nI\n\n3,926 Kg\n8,656 Ibs\n\n1\n\n1 1,778 Kg\n25,968 Ibs\n\n13,712 Ibs\n\n1\n\n2448 Kg\n5,400 Ibs\n\nFigure 3\n\n30\n\n9,330 Kg\n20,568 Ibs\n\nI\n\nallow a series interconnect capability for subsequent Logistics Modules. The liquids\nand gasses could remain attached to the module in a ring arrangement occupying the annular\nvolume between two interfacing conical end bulkheads and docking mechanisms, and\ninterconnected to the Lunar Base through lines passing through the docking interfaces.\nThe design of the Logistics Module stowage container attachments should be of a standard\nlength with standardized rack fittings which are compatible with the Space Station racks.\nThe location of the tanks for the liquids and gasses may be outside the pressurized\nvolume and attached in a modular fashion to either the Personnel Transfer Module or\nthe Logistics Module to allow growth capability for future missions. Those items which\nare not required to be pressurized may be delivered on a pallet or truss structure attached\nto the Logistics Module. This structure would be for the delivery of spares for surface\nequipment which may be larger than the volume that can be transferred through the\nstandard hatch opening. Open structures will also be lighter in weight and allow access\nfor equipment operating in the exposed lunar environment.\nA major advantage of having a pressurized module with modular detachable tanks and\nincrementally sized pallets, is that the pressurized module could be centrally located\nfor both mass and volume by adding the modular tanks and pallet or pairs of pallets at\neither end of the pressurized module. This would allow the center of gravity and volume\nto be better located to keep them within the limits for the O W and Lunar Lander\nduring delivery to the Moon.\nAttachment fittings which would ~ O standard size racks to be attached to the pallet\nW\nstructure should be considered for this structure.\nTo allow attachment of subsequent Logistics Modules to the pressurized volume, the\nopen structure would have to be removed from the pressurized module to access the\ndocking interface at the end of the pressurized Logistics Module.\n\n6.3.5\n\nSupply Options Recommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the supply consumables and spares be delivered with the manned\nmissions for the 8 day and 24 day surface stay missions. Considerations for packaging\nmass should be factored into the data for the next series of tasks. In addition, provisions\nfor spare parts delivery and lunar surface storage should be included in the scenario for\nthe development of the Lunar Base.\nWith the increased support requ,irements of the 180 day missions, modules should be\ndeveloped to carry the supply items to the Lunar Base. To accomplish this, three categories\nof shipping modules should be developed and the selection of the type of container for\npackaging the supply item should be made on the basis of its nature, size, and intended\nusage location. These are a pressurized Logistics Module, fluid and cryogenic tankage\nmodule, and incrementally sized unpressurized pallets. Standardized attachment points\nshould be utilized on the Logistics Module and Lander bays to allow transfer and storage\nof supply items between both elements. The Logistics Module should be designed to\nprovide pressurized storage which can be interconnected to the Lunar Base for shirt\nsleeve access to supplies, tankage module for liquids and gasses, and unpressurized structure\nfor carrying large items and those items designed to be used on the exposed lunar surface.\nAdditional trade studies should be performed to investigate the option of repackaging\nequipment, consumables, and spares at the Space Station to allow for significant reduction\nin mass for the Logistic Module, fluid module, and pallets if they are designed for space\n31\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\ntransportation and Lunar landing loads instead of Shuttle operational loads. These mass\nreductions may be offset by the requirement to launch additional empty, low mass logistic\nmodules, pallets, etc. from Earth. This study should also evaluate the operational role\nof the Space Station for the support of the Lunar Base and identify the impact of those\nrequirements on the present Space Station baseline.\nThe support of the permanently manned Lunar Base should include a logistics supply\nflight every two years of an unmanned lander to deliver the necessary spares and consumables. The lunar base models currently in existence do not adequately account for\nthis supply mass and it must be considered when manifesting flights for a more mature\nbase, and in lander sizing for an early base.\n\nI\nI\n1\nI\n1\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n32\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\ni\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n7.0 Conclusions and Recommendations\nThis task developed a phased approach to maintenance and supply of the Lunar Base.\nAs the crew stay time and crew complement grew, maintenance tasks were gradually\ntransferred to the Lunar Base. This was also matched with the availability of spares\nand repair equipment as the Base developed.\nThe results of the crew size trade indicated that the baseline crew size of four had\nthe minimum mass impact but also had limited resources in terms of crew time available.\nIf operational flexibility is desired however, a crew complement of six provided the\nmost flexibility with the least amount of impact. It is also recommended that the sizing\nof the Habitat Module be increased to accommodate the crew for the permanently manned\nbase.\nEvaluation of crew surface stay times disclosed that increased operational crew time\ncan be easily obtained through the extension of surface stay times with a small increase\nin consumables. For short surface stay time extensions, the extra consumable mass was\nsmall compared to all other factors. For medium length stay times, the advantage of\nincreasing the stay time Erom 24 days to 42 days was that two lunar day cycles could\nbe gained on a single mission for the cost of the consumables to support the crew. The\nadvantage of gaining the additional crew time on the lunar surface on a single mission\nis obvious. To assure that the crew operational limits will not be exceeded, it is recommended that the stay times begjn with the bmeline valI~esand be, increased as experien~p\nindicates the ability to perform surface operations will not be severely constrained by\nstay times or level of activity on the surface. These conclusions assume a partially\nclosed ECLSS for all stay times. A major concern was the impact of transportation\norbital mechanics which may limit the windows of opportunity for travel between the\nEarth and the Moon. It is recommended that the issue of surface stay time be readdressed\nafter a detailed study of transportation orbital mechanics has been performed.\nThe supply option trade indicated a phased approach of supply delivery to the lunar\nsurface. During .the periods while the crew spends either 8 or 24 days on the surface,\nsupply items should be carried with the Personnel Trmsfer Module or in available space\nin the Lander bays.\nSubsequent studies and data bases should increase the total supply mass estimates to\ninclude containerization mass and spares to the items delivered in the supply packages.\nThe estimates of consumables mass indicated in the CNDB data should be increased since\nthis task evaluation almost equalled the supply masses by only considering crew metabolic\nneeds and losses due to leakage and EVA activities. In reality, housekeeping consumables,\nand maintenance and servicing consumables for the equipment on the lunar surface will\nequal or exceed those amounts calculated for crew needs alone. Future lander sizing\nwork must also take these additional masses into account.\nWith the extended duration missions of 180 days, a Logistics Module should be utilized.\nThe Logistics Module is estimated to weigh 4,053 kg. (8,936lb.) and be 5.7 meters (18.6\nft.) in length. To support the majority of the supply needs of the Lunar Base, a dedicated\nunmanned lander is required to deliver the Logistics Module to the lunar surface every\ntwo years. Additionally, provisions for carrying large spares and items to be operated\nin the unpressurized environment should be provided with the incorporation of a pallet\nor truss structure which can be connected to the Logistics Module. Fluids and gasses\nare best handled by modular ring tanks which can either be attached to the Personnel\nTransfer Module or the Logistics Module.\n33\n\nOther issues raised by this study are as follows:\n\n0\n\nThe reliability of the Lunar Base equipment must be significantly higher than that\nof the Space Station due to the longer interval for resupply and repair of failed\nequipment.\n\n0\n\nThe equipment must be designed to be easily maintained and repaired by the crew\nwithout occupying over 20% of their available time.\n\n0\n\nThe role and support capability of the Space Station needs to be assessed and\nprovisions made to provide that capability to support the Lunar Base.\n\n34\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nCivil Needs Data Base, Version 3.0, National Space Transportation and Support\nStudy, July 16, 1987.\n\n2.\n\n&ace Station Definition and Preliminary Design, Preliminary Analysis and Design\nDocument, (DR-02), Books 1 through Book 26, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics\nCompany.\n\n3.\n\nSpace Station Definition and Preliminary Design, Time-Phased SE&I Study Products:\nData Package 2.3 (DR-19) Book 3, MDC H2002, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics\nCompany, September 1985.\n\n4.\n\n"Manned Mars Missions, Working Group Papers", NASA M002,June 1986 - Manned\nMars Mission Environmental Control and Life Support Subsystem Preliminary Report,\nVive Hueter.\n\n5.\n\nK.
