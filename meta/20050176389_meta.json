The growth of these nations depends on their attracting and holding the industrial investments of developed nations. This will not be likely with the antiquated telecommunications infrastructure typical of developing nations. On the contrary, it will require an infrastructure that is compatible with international standards. Most of the developing nations perceive this necessity and are pursuing the necessary upgrades. The rate of replacement, types of technology, services affected, and the terrestrial/satellite mix differ by each nation's priorities and gross national product (GNP).", "title": "Potential Market for Satellite Technology in Meeting Telecommunication Needs of Developing Nations", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050176389, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050176389, "id": "f4f4861a680b4447b42097b9c9422351", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1995", "publicationDate": "1996-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050176389.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050176389/downloads/20050176389.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050176389/downloads/20050176389.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050176389/downloads/20050176389.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
