Hurrell, Ronald H. Soeder, Roy A. Lottig,\nand Kent S. Jefferies\n\nLewis Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThe SNAP-8 space power system uses a nuclear reactor as the heat source and a\nturboelectric power conversion system operating on the mercury Rankine cycle f o r con\xc2\xad\nverting this heat t o electric power. An extensive startup program was conducted on a\nSNAP-8 test system consisting of a power conversion system, reactor simulator, and\nradiator simulator. Startup procedures w e r e experimentally evaluated for the relatively\nfast transient that brings the system to self-sustained operation and f o r the m o r e gradual\ntransient that achieves rated power output.\nFrom the test results, startup procedures w e r e defined that provide for dependable\nstartup of the power conversion system and substantial margin i n regard to reactor limi\xc2\xad\ntations. F o r these procedures, the temperature transients imposed on the reactor s i m \xc2\xad\nulator w e r e well within the acceptable values f o r the reactor.\n\n1NTRODUCTl ON\nElectrical generating s y s t e m s using a nuclear reactor as the heat source are p r i m e\ncandidates for space flight missions requiring many kilowatts of electric power. A\nrelatively efficient way t o convert the thermal power of a nuclear reactor t o electrical\npower is by means of a turboelectric power conversion system, such as the SNAP-8\nm e r c u r y Rankine system (ref. 1). The successful development of a turboelectric system\nf o r space, however, requires that considerable attention be directed towards defining\nstartup procedures that are dependable and, at the s a m e time, compatible with the opera\xc2\xad\ntional constraints of the reactor. In a n efficient startup of the turboelectric system, that\nis, one that requires minimal auxiliary power and equipment, startup dependability re\xc2\xad\nq u i r e s a relatively fast transient t o a self -sustained condition. Fast startups, however,\n\nI\n\n\nmay cause temperature gradients in the reactor that exceed the constraining values and\noverly stress the nuclear fuel elements.\nStartup, therefore, has been the subject of much analytical and experimental work\nin the development of the SNAP-8 power conversion system. Throughout the system de\xc2\xad\nvelopment program, computer simulations have been used t o formulate promising start up procedures and to point out problem areas requiring experimental investigation\n(refs. 2 and 3). Experimental startup studies began in 1965 when a simplified two-phase\nm e r c u r y loop was coupled with a r e a c t o r simulator and a radiator simulator at the Lewis\nResearch Center. This system was used t o study reactor loop transients during startup\nof the mercury loop (ref. 4). In 1968, the contractor f o r the power conversion system\nconducted a series of startup t e s t s on a power conversion system using a gas-fired heat\nsource. In these tests, the feasibility of completely automatic startups was demon\xc2\xad\nstrated. The culmination of the startup work came in 1969 at the Lewis Research Center\nwhen 135 startup tests w e r e conducted on a power conversion system coupled with a re\xc2\xad\nactor simulator and a radiator simulator. For the first time, startup procedures f o r a\ncomplete power conversion system were experimentally evaluated concurrently with the\nassociated reactor loop transients. The objective was final definition of startup pro\xc2\xad\ncedures providing ample margin in relation to the requirements of both the power con\xc2\xad\nversion system and the reactor.\nThe results of the l a t t e r test program are presented and discussed in this report.\nThe discussion is centered first on the critical phase of the startup that brings the s y s \xc2\xad\ntem to self-sustained operation and second o n t h e startup phase that raises the power\noutput of the system t o the rated value. For both phases, factors that must be considered\nin selecting the r a t e of increase of the mercury flow are discussed. In addition, the per\xc2\xad\nformance of the condenser p r e s s u r e control is presented f o r both phases.\n\nTEST SYSTEM\nThe test system was essentially a complete SNAP-8 power conversion system coupled\nwith a reactor simulator and a radiator simulator. A simplified schematic diagram of\nthe test system is shown in figure 1. The major components of the power conversion\nsystem w e r e the boiler, turbine-alternator, condenser, auxiliary heat exchanger, and\nsystem pumps. These components were flight-type, but the system was not arranged in\na flight configuration. The test system configuration was selected f o r easy accessibility\nof components and instrumentation; however, attention was given t o preserving the firsto r d e r dynamic characteristics of a flight-configured system. In o r d e r to provide flexi\xc2\xad\nbility in conducting the t e s t program, the startup controls used in the power conversion\nsystem w e r e not flight-type but were, rather, test-support equipment.\n2\n\n1\n\nh\n\n1\n\nThe sodium -potassium (NaK) p r i m a r y loop contained a centrifugal motor -driven\npump, t h e reactor simulator, t h e boiler, and the auxiliary heat exchanger. An electric\nheater (ref. 5) together with a n ignitron power controller and an analog computer com\xc2\xad\nprised the reactor simulator. The electric heater was configured s i m i l a r t o the reactor,\nand reactor nucleonics and control logic w e r e programmed on the computer. The power\ncontroller matched the heater electrical power with the time -varying computer signal\nrepresenting reactor power. , Details of t h e reactor simulator are given in references 4\nand 6. The purpose of the auxiliary heat exchanger was t o provide a heat sink for the\nreactor, o r r e a c t o r simulator, p r i o r t o startup of the mercury loop.\nThe major components in the mercury power loop included a centrifugal pump and\nmotor, the counterflow boiler, the four-stage axial-flow turbine-alternator, and the\ncondenser. The boiler was a seven-tube-in-shell heat exchanger utilizing tantalum as\nthe mercury containment material f o r long-term corrosion resistance (refs. 7 and 8).\nThe condenser was a counterflow tube-in-shell heat exchanger with 78 tapered tubes con\xc2\xad\ntaining the mercury (ref. 9). The turbine-alternator and the pump are described in ref\xc2\xad\nerences 10 and 11, respectively.\nThe heat-rejection loop included a centrifugal motor -driven pump, t h e condenser,\nand the radiator simulator. This simulator used two finned NaK-to-air multitube heat\nexchangers. Two butterfly valves controlled by the analog computer varied the airflows\nto the heat exchangers in o r d e r t o match the outlet NaK temperature t o that computed f o r\na space radiator. The heat exchangers w e r e modified p r i o r to startup testing by addition\nof metallic m a s s i n o r d e r that the heat capacity of these exchangers would be equal to the\nanticipated heat capacity of a typical space radiator. A complete description of the\nradiator simulator is given in reference 12. The feed-forward control circuit reported\nin reference 12 was not used during this s e r i e s of tests. Only feedback control was used.\nBecause an accurate simulation of radiator outlet temperature was essential f o r realistic\ncondenser conditions i n startup, the outlet temperature transient of the radiator simulator\nduring a typical startup was compared with the transient computed with a digital computer\nmodel of a flight radiator. The agreement was satisfactory.\nA lubricant-coolant loop (not shown in fig. 1) containing polyphenyl ether (4P3E) was\nused t o lubricate and cool the turbine-alternator and mercury pump. It w a s also used t o\ncool oxide t r a p s on the NaK pumps.\nAs mentioned previously, the controls necessary f o r startups used test support\nequipment r a t h e r than flight -type components. This provided flexibility in conducting\nthe test program. The mercury r e s e r v o i r shown i n figure 1 was used t o inject the m e r \xc2\xad\ncury loop inventory during startup. The r e s e r v o i r was a standpipe pressurized with\ngas. In the flight system, the mercury would be injected at the same location (pump\ninlet) ; however, the r e s e r v o i r would be pressurized by the lubricant-coolant pump.\nThe flow control valve in the mercury loop (fig. 1) was actuated electrohydraulically\n3\n\nand was used t o generate mercury flow ramps f o r the startups. A combination open-loop\nand feedback control of mercury flow was used with this valve. Figure 2 shows a block\ndiagram of the control. The open-loop path provided the main control, while the feed\xc2\xad\nback loop served merely as a trimming control to eliminate any e r r o r . The gain of the\nfeedback loop, therefore, could be kept low t o ensure stability. In a flight system, the\nm e r c u r y flow control valve would be actuated by an electric motor with only open-loop\n(programmed) control. The valve area variation would be specifically contoured f o r the\nselected flow ramps.\nThe flow control valve in the NaK heat-rejection loop (fig. 1) was electropneumati\xc2\xad\ncally actuated. A feedback control of NaK flow was used with this valve. This control\nreceived its input, o r demand, signal from the condenser p r e s s u r e control (fig. 3),\nwhich was flight-type in regard t o its control logic. This logic will be discussed in the\nsection Condenser p r e s s u r e control. For a flight system, the electropneumatic valve\nwith flow feedback would be replaced by a n electric-motor-operated valve with a special\xc2\xad\nly contoured a r e a variation.\nThe other valves shown in figure 1 w e r e used in the open-closed mode. Valve se\xc2\xad\nquencing and other procedures w e r e automated in 27 startups by u s e of a breadboard\nprogrammer.\nF o r some of the tests, the original SNAP-8 inverter (a d c motor and a three-phase\nfour-pole permanent-magnet alternator) supplied the necessary power t o drive the s y s \xc2\xad\ntem pumps p r i o r t o startup of the turbine-alternator. T h i s inverter provided a frequency\nrange from 95 t o 260 hertz. When the test program called f o r frequencies and powers\nbeyond the capabilities of this inverter, a test-facility inverter was used.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\nSystem p r e s s u r e s including those at the mercury pump outlet, mercury boiler inlet\nand outlet, and the mercury condenser inlet w e r e measured with slack-diaphragm\xc2\xad\ncapillary -tube p r e s s u r e transducers.\nThe mercury liquid flow rate was obtained by means of a calibrated Venturi m e t e r\nlocated upstream of the boiler inlet. The differential p r e s s u r e of the Venturi was m e a s \xc2\xad\nured by a transducer of the slack-diaphragm-capillary-tube type. This differential\np r e s s u r e measurement was used in conjunction with the analog computer t o provide an\non-line flow signal. Flows of NaK w e r e measured by eleztromagnetic flowmeters.\nThe reactor simulator inlet and outlet NaK temperatures w e r e measured by ChromelAlumel thermocouples mounted on the outside surface of the piping.\nThe pump input powers w e r e measured by thermal-element watt transducers, and\nthe input electrical power of the reactor simulator was measured by a Hall-effect watt\n4\n\n\nP\n\nf\n\ntransducer. The output power of the alternator was measured by an electrodynamometer\nwatt transducer. Power measurement transducers w e r e calibrated over their expected\noperating range by a voltmeter and a precision current shunt.\nPump speeds w e r e measured with electromagnetic speed pickups. Turbinealternator speed was obtained from the alternator output frequency. A detailed descrip\xc2\xad\ntion of system instrumentation is given in references 13 and 14.\nStrip-chart analog r e c o r d e r s in the control room w e r e used t o record transient data.\nConditioned voltage signals f o r the variables of interest w e r e sent to these recorders.\nBefore the r e c o r d e r s w e r e used, each channel was calibrated at z e r o span, full span,\nand midspan by a voltage source t o create expected recorder input voltage values. A\ncomputerized digital data recording system was a l s o used t o record transient data, as\nwell as steady-state data. The recording system scanned and recorded a cycle of data,\ncontaining 400 different instrument outputs, in 11.43 seconds. A computer program,\nwhich calculated test-system p a r a m e t e r s , processed each cycle of transient data sepa\xc2\xad\nrately. The results w e r e stored on tape, and output was obtained i n tabulated form and\nin computer plots.\n\nSTARTUP PROCEDURE\nThe startup pla for a flight SNAP-8 system calls f o r startup of t h reactor followed\nby a slow increase of the reactor and boiler temperatures t o rated values. The primaryloop NaK is circulated by running the pump at reduced speed on battery-inverter power.\nWhile the primary loop is being heated, the mercury remains in the injection r e s e r v o i r ,\nthe mercury loop being at vacuum conditions. During this heating period, the reactor\npower is brought t o a value of about 100 kilowatts (one-fifth of the required power for\nrated SNAP-8 conditions) by dissipating heat to space through the auxiliary heat ex\xc2\xad\nchanger and the radiator. The heat-rejection-loop pump, running at reduced speed on\nthe inverter, circulates NaK through both the radiator and the auxiliary heat exchanger.\nReactor operation at this power level of about 100 kilowatts is necessary to ensure sat\xc2\xad\nisfactory reactor response during the transient introduced by power conversion system\nstartup. At the end of the primary-loop heatup, the inverter frequency is increased\nlinearly up t o the value required by the mercury pump during mercury injection. Asso\xc2\xad\nciated with this increase in inverter frequency is an increase in primary-loop and i n\nheat -re jection-loop flow. When the resultant temperature transients in the primary loop\nhave settled out, startup of the power conversion system may begin.\nIn the test program, the initial condition f o r startups of the power conversion system\ncorresponded t o the end of the primary-loop heating period with the primary-loop tem\xc2\xad\np e r a t u r e s steady at the values associated with the final inverter frequency. The reactor\n\n5 \n\n\nsimulator outlet temperature was within the range of 967 t o 989 K (1280\' t o 1320\' F),\nwhich was the dead band of the simulated r e a c t o r control. Reactor simulator power was\nusually close t o 100 kilowatts, although some variations about this value w e r e used.\nPrimary-loop flow ranged from 12 000 t o 17 000 kilograms p e r hour (26 500 t o 37 500\nlb/hr), depending upon the inverter frequency, which was a test variable in the mercury\ninjection study. The heat-rejection-loop flow was throttled t o values of 2300 t o 3200\nkilograms per hour (5000 t o 7000 lb/hr) by the initial setting of the heat-rejection flow\ncontrol valve. Radiator simulator outlet temperature was generally about 310 K (100\' F .\n)\nJ u s t p r i o r t o mercury injection, the heat t r a n s f e r through the auxiliary heat exchanger\nwas stopped by closing the open-closed valve in the auxiliary loop.\nPower conversion system startup has two different phases. In the first phase, the\nsystem is brought rather rapidly t o a minimum self-sustaining power level at which all\nof the rotating components are at rated speed. The second phase consists of slowly\nraising the power output t o the rated value.\nThe first phase is called the bootstrap operation. In the test program, the mercury\nloop lines between the boiler and the pump and between the condenser and the pump w e r e\nprefilled with liquid mercury (fig. 1). Then the mercury pump was started and operated\nat reduced speed on the inverter. Speeds of 55 t o 75 percent of rated w e r e used. Next,\nthe pump was filled with liquid mercury by opening the valve at the pump inlet and the\ninjection valve. When the pump inlet p r e s s u r e indicated that the pump was filled, the\nopen-closed valve at the pump outlet was opened. (For a flight system, the valves at\nthe pump inlet and outlet would be eliminated and the lines and pump would be filled in\none operation.) After pump filling, the open-closed valve at the boiler inlet was opened\nand the mercury flow control valve started a r a m p upward in mercury flow, drawing in\xc2\xad\nventory from the mercury reservoir (standpipe). When the frequency of the accelerating\nturbine-alternator reached that of the inverter, the mercury pump and the other system\npumps w e r e transferred from inverter power t o alternator power. The turbine\xc2\xad\nalternator-pump combination then accelerated t o rated speed. The ramp in mercury flow\nwas stopped at the level required t o sustain the system i n steady state safely. This selfsustaining flow was 3000 kilograms p e r hour (6600 lb/hr). At the end of the ramp, the\ncondenser outlet valve was opened. The mercury r e s e r v o i r valve was closed when the\ndesired inventory had been injected. The mercury loop was then a closed system with\nthe pump inlet pressurized by the condenser. Condensing p r e s s u r e was controlled by the\ndead-band condenser control manipulating the flow control valve in the heat-rejection\nloop.\nThe startup sequence provides f o r a time delay between the conclusion of the boot s t r a p operation and the remainder of the startup which brings the power output of the\nsystem t o its rated value. This delay allows the reactor loop transients t o subside. The\nsecond phase is accomplished by gradually ramping the mercury flow up t o its rated value\n\n1\n\nof 5580 kilograms p e r hour (12 300 lb/hr). This ramp is called the power ramp.\nFigure 4 shows the transients in mercury flow, rotating speeds, and net alternator\npower output for both phases of the power conversion system startup.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nB ootstrap Operation\n\nf\n\n1\n\nThe most critical part of t h e power conversion system startup is the bootstrap oper\xc2\xad\nation. Consequently, a l a r g e percentage of the startup runs was devoted t o examining\nthis operation. Ninety-one runs w e r e made in which some, o r all, of the pumps w e r e\nbrought t o rated speed by the accelerating turbine-alternator. These runs w e r e used\nprimarily t o study two important factors in the bootstrap operation: the mercury flow\nramp duration and condenser p r e s s u r e control. The ramp-duration study will be dis\xc2\xad\ncussed first. The objective was t o determine the ramp duration that would give de\xc2\xad\npendable bootstrapping and, at the s a m e time, cause minimum disturbances in the re\xc2\xad\nactor loop.\nlimit f o r duration of mercury flow ramp. - A startup showing the maximum\nMaximum-~\nlimit f o r duration of the bootstrap ramp is shown in figure 5. In this figure, the mercury\nflow and turbine-alternator speed are shown as functions of time. The mercury flow was\nstarted up on a ramp with an intended duration of 145 seconds, as shown by the dashed\nlines. At 70 seconds the alternator frequency was equal t o the inverter frequency and\nthe pumps w e r e t r a n s f e r r e d t o alternator power. After this t r a n s f e r , t h e acceleration\nof the turbine-alternator and pumps became very slow. In fact, the acceleration of the\nmercury pump was s o slow that the mercury flow dropped below the intended ramp. As\nrated speed was approached, a s m a l l additional load was added because of the automatic\nactivation of the turbine speed control. With this addition, the load exceeded the available\npower and caused the turbine-alternator t o decelerate rapidly. Because the pumps w e r e\nbeing supplied with alternator power, the mercury flow a l s o fell rapidly because of the\ndeceleration of the pump. At this point (105 sec) the pumps w e r e t r a n s f e r r e d manually\nt o an auxiliary power supply. This allowed the turbine-alternator t o recover its accel\xc2\xad\neration to rated speed. Otherwise, the startup would have been unsuccessful.\nAn understanding of the problem experienced in this run can be gained from figure 6,\nwhich indicates the speed and power characteristics of the turbine-alternator and pumps\nduring a typical bootstrap ramp. In the speed plot, the initial pump speeds are shown\nby a horizontal dashed line. Pump t r a n s f e r from auxiliary power t o alternator power\noccurs at the intersection of the dashed line and the turbine-alternator speed curve. The\nremainder of the speed curve, up t o rated speed, applies t o both the pumps and turbinealternator and represents the bootstrapping. The turbine output power provided by the\n~\n\n~~\n\n7 \n\n\n,\n\n11111\nI\n\nmercury vapor flow and the total pump power load on the turbine are a l s o shown i n fig\xc2\xad\nu r e 6. The difference between the turbine output power and the pump power at any t i m e\nrepresents the instantaneous turbine power margin. The turbine-alternator accelerates\nat a rate proportional to this margin. If the power margin is too small, any perturba\xc2\xad\ntion i n turbine power o r load can cause deceleration of the turbine-alternator. An ex\xc2\xad\nample of this was the load added by the speed control, as shown in figure 5. As can be\nseen in figure 6 , the minimum power margin occurs when the turbine-alternator ap\xc2\xad\nproaches rated speed. This results from the fact that the power requirement of the\npumps increases with the cube of the speed.\nFigure 7 shows the minimum turbine power margin as a function of mercury flow\nramp duration. The dashed line in the figure represents the steady-state margin asso\xc2\xad\nciated with the final flow of the bootstrap ramp. This steady-state margin in turbine\noutput power was calculated from the electrical power measurements f o r the alternator\nand pumps by using p r i o r information on alternator efficiency. The data points in the\nfigure, which represent the minimum power margins in the transients, w e r e determined\nby adjusting the steady-state value by the fraction of the steady-state flow that had been\nreached when the turbine achieved rated speed. This procedure was considered m o r e\naccurate f o r the transient data than the use of the electrical power measurements. Fig\xc2\xad\nu r e 7 shows that the power margin became s m a l l f o r the longer mercury flow ramps.\nF o r the s h o r t e r ramps, the minimum power margin was equal t o the steady-state m a r \xc2\xad\ngin. However, as the r a m p duration became longer than approximately 70 seconds, the\nminimum power margin decreased. The margin w a s essentially z e r o for a ramp dura\xc2\xad\ntion of 145 seconds.\nramp.\nMinimum limit f\n-o r duration of m e r c u r y flow ___ - Shorter m e r c u r y flow ramps,\n~.\ntherefore, make the bootstrapping m o r e dependable. However, consideration must be\ngiven to two factors that tend t o impose a minimum limit on the ramp duration. One of\nthese was a problem encountered in the mercury loop involving the transient p r e s s u r e d r o p characteristics of the boiler. The second was the concern f o r reactor-simulator\ntransients which, if too severe, could be detrimental to a n actual reactor.\nThe variation with time of p a r a m e t e r s pertinent to the m e r c u r y loop problem, in\xc2\xad\ncluding pump and turbine speeds, pump discharge p r e s s u r e , boiler inlet and exit p r e s \xc2\xad\ns u r e s , and mercury flow, is shown in figure 8. F o r this startup, the intended mercury\nflow ramp duration was 30 seconds, as shown by the dashed lines. With the mercury\npump still at its initial speed, however, the mercury flow began to deviate from the in\xc2\xad\ntended ramp. This was caused by the boiler pressure-drop transient. At approximately\n28 seconds into the ramp, boiling began abruptly, as indicated by the boiler inlet pres\xc2\xad\ns u r e . At this time, the boiler inlet p r e s s u r e r o s e rapidly and approached the level of\npump discharge pressure. Consequently, the p r e s s u r e drop available f o r the mercury\nflow control valve was too small, and the flow r a m p could not be maintained. This prob~\n\nc\n\n1\n\nlem could be eliminated with a higher initial speed of the mercury pump.\nStartup test data showed that the initial pump speed, o r power supply frequency, re\xc2\xad\nquired t o maintain the intended m e r c u r y flow ramp was related to the ramp duration\n(fig. 9). F o r a given r a m p duration, initial pump speeds above the curve shown in fig\xc2\xad\nu r e 9 provided sufficient pump discharge p r e s s u r e t o maintain the flow ramp, despite\nt h e surge in boiler inlet pressure. However, initial pump speeds below the curve did\nnot produce enough p r e s s u r e t o maintain the intended flow ramp. As shown in the figure,\nthe m e r c u r y pump initial speed requirement increased by a factor of approximately 2 in\ngoing from a 145-second ramp t o a 30-second ramp. This means the inverter power\nrequired to drive the pump at the higher speed would increase by a factor of 8. F o r the\nmercury pump alone, the factor of 8 would not be significant, since the power involved\nis small. F o r simplicity, however, all pumps of the system should u s e a common fre\xc2\xad\nquency from the auxiliary power supply. Since the pump speeds are directly proportional\nt o power supply frequency, a higher speed f o r the mercury pump would entail a higher\nspeed f o r all pumps. Thus, the factor of 8 becomes important.\nThe second factor which tends t o dictate a minimum limit for the ramp duration is\nthe constraint imposed on reactor temperature transients. If the mercury flow w e r e\nramped up to the self-sustaining level in a short time, heat would be extracted rapidly\nfrom the boiler, and the temperature of the NaK entering the reactor would drop quickly.\nAn excessively fast temperature change in the reactor could impose undesirable thermal\ns t r e s s gradients i n the reactor fuel elements. Therefore, in selecting a mercury flow\nramp duration, consideration has t o be given to the rate of change of reactor-simulator\ninlet temperature. The maximum allowable rate of change of reactor inlet temperature\nis dependent on the time duration of the particular rate of change. The constraint varies\nfrom 1 . 4 K (2.5\' R) p e r second f o r r a t e s of change that exist f o r 60 seconds o r m o r e t o\n5.6 K (0 R) p e r second f o r instantaneous r a t e s of change.\n1\'\nFigure 10 shows how the rate of change of reactor-simulator inlet temperature com\xc2\xad\npared with the reactor constraint f o r various values of the mercury flow ramp duration.\nThe comparison is made f o r average rates of change over 10-second intervals. The data\nsymbols represent the maximum 10-second rate of change f o r a given startup, and the\ndashed line designates the appropriate value of the reactor constraint. Comparison of\nthe solid curve through the data symbols with the dashed line shows that the 10-second\nr a t e of temperature change at the reactor simulator inlet was below the reactor constraint\nby a significant factor for all of the ramp durations. There was a definite decrease i n\nthe safety factor, however, with decreasing ramp duration. The safety factor was 4 f o r\na 140-second ramp duration but decreased t o 2 f o r a ramp duration of 30 seconds. Ek\xc2\xad\namination of data other than those shown in figure 10 indicated that s i m i l a r safety factors\nin the rate of temperature change existed f o r time intervals either longer or s h o r t e r\nthan 10 seconds.\n9\n\n\nSelection of - -.\nramp. - In selecting the mercury flow ramp duration f o r the bootstrap\noperation, consideration must be given to the maximum limit associated with the turbine\nminimum power margin and the consequences of backing off too f a r from this limit. As\ndiscussed in the previous section, inverter power required f o r the pumps increases as\nthe r a m p duration decreases, as does the rate of change of reactor-simulator inlet tem\xc2\xad\nperature. F o r convenience, the tradeoffs involved in selecting the ramp duration are\nshown i n figure 11. The turbine power margin, initial pump power requirement, and\nthe maximum rate of change of reactor-simulator inlet temperature f o r a 10-second in\xc2\xad\nt e r v a l are shown as functions of mercury flow ramp duration. Based on the curves\nshown in figure 11, a r a m p duration in the range of 80 t o 100 seconds is a good selection.\nRamps in this range provide almost the steady-state turbine power margin, a relatively\nlow initial pump power requirement, and a safety factor of 3 from the constraining value\nof inlet temperature rate of change for the reactor.\nFigure 12 illustrates the transients of several variables during a bootstrap opera\xc2\xad\ntion with a 100-second mercury $low ramp. An initial speed of 72.5 percent of rated\nspeed was used f o r all the pumps. For the mercury pump, this initial speed satisfied\nthe criterion of figure 9. As shown in figure 12, the m e r c u r y flow transient adhered\nr a t h e r closely t o the intended r a m p (dashed lines) and the turbine-alternator accelerated\nsmoothly t o rated speed with the pump load t r a n s f e r occurring at about 5 5 seconds, The\nlargest reactor-simulator inlet temperature rate of change f o r a 10-second interval was\napproximately 1.4 K (2. 5\' R) per second. This occurred during the time interval from\n60 to 70 seconds.\nCondenser p r e s s u r e control. - As mentioned previously, another important aspect\nof the bootstrap operation is condenser p r e s s u r e control. There is an upper limit of\ncondenser p r e s s u r e associated with the self-sustaining value of mercury flow, since this\np r e s s u r e is the turbine back p r e s s u r e . During the flow ramp, the p r e s s u r e must not\nbuild up toward this limit too quickly. If it does, the turbine-alternator acceleration will\nbe impeded. There is a l s o a lower limit for condenser p r e s s u r e after the injection\nprocess ends. Then, in a zero-gravity environment, the pump suction p r e s s u r e is es\xc2\xad\nsentially equal t o the condenser p r e s s u r e . Consequently, the condenser p r e s s u r e at the\nend of mercury injection has t o be large enough t o prevent pump cavitation. Because of\nthese limits, a condenser p r e s s u r e control is used i n the startup.\nThe control is a dead-band control. The concept is shown i n figure 13. The bottom\nplot shows the mercury flow r a m p t o the self-sustaining level. The plot at the top shows\nthe acceptable corridor for the condenser p r e s s u r e as prescribed by the turbine back\np r e s s u r e and pump suction p r e s s u r e requirements. Corrective action is taken whenever\nthe condenser p r e s s u r e goes outside the prescribed dead band, represented by the dashed\nlines within the acceptable corridor. The corrective action is shown in the middle plot\nand consists of ramping the condenser NaK flow upward when the p r e s s u r e goes above\n10\n\n\' 1\n\nI\n\n\'\n\n\t\n\nthe dead band and downward when the p r e s s u r e goes below the dead band. The control\ndoes not operate when the p r e s s u r e is within the dead band. In addition, the control does\nnot operate during the initial buildup of condenser p r e s s u r e into the dead band. T h i s\np r e s s u r e buildup is controlled by an initial condenser NaK flow.\nThe performance of the condenser p r e s s u r e control was thoroughly investigated.\nMany of the tests involved the u s e of off-design startup conditions. This subjected the\ncontrol t o extreme condenser transients. The testing showed that dead bands as s m a l l\nas 1 . 4 newtons p e r square centimeter (2 psia) resulted in stable control provided the\nramp rate of the condenser NaK coolant flow was low (about 15 percent of rated NaK flow\np e r minute). With this ramp rate low, however, initial overshoot of the dead band and,\nhence, high turbine back p r e s s u r e w e r e a problem f o r some startups. The overshoot\nproblem was corrected by doubling the rate of the coolant flow r a m p t o a value of about\n30 percent of rated NaK flow per minute. With this higher rate, dead bands of 2 . 1 o r\n2 . 8 newtons p e r square centimeter (3 o r 4 psia) w e r e required f o r adequate stability\nmargin. The zero-gravity requirement f o r pump suction p r e s s u r e was satisfied by using\ninitial NaK flows below about 15 percent of the rated value.\nThe performance of the p r e s s u r e control during extreme condenser transients is\nillustrated in figures 14 and 15. In the startup shown in figure 14, the mercury flow was\nramped up t o the self-sustaining level in 30 seconds r a t h e r than in the p r e f e r r e d time\nof 80 to 100 seconds. In the startup shown in figure 15, m o r e than twice the design value\nof liquid mercury inventory was allowed t o accumulate in the condenser before injection\nwas stopped. For both startups, the p r e s s u r e response was satisfactory i n regard t o\ninitial overshoot. Although the initial overshoot of the p r e s s u r e above the dead band was\nnoticeable, it was small enough t o avoid an appreciable l o s s in turbine power. Both\np r e s s u r e responses w e r e also good in regard to the number of oscillations and the a m \xc2\xad\nplitude of the oscillations. Finally, the p r e s s u r e s at the end of injection for both startups were well above the value required for pump suction in z e r o gravity. Many other\ntests of this nature showed that the control could cope with a wide range of conditions in\nthe bootstrap operation. A detailed discussion of the condenser p r e s s u r e control test\nresults can be found in reference 15.\n\nPower Ramp\nStabilization time. - The final phase of startup is the power ramp. It begins after a\nstabilization period f o r the reactor loop transients caused by the bootstrap operation.\nThese transients a r e illustrated in figure 16. The bottom plot shows the bootstrap ramp\nof mercury flow to the self-sustaining flow. The middle plot shows the power response\nof the reactor simulator. The top plot shows the inlet and outlet NaK temperatures of\n11\n\nI It\n\nthe reactor simulator. It can be seen that the power and temperature transients w e r e\nconsiderably diminished after 2 cycles, o r 1200 seconds. A stabilization time of 1200\nseconds, therefore, was selected.\nThe period of stabilization f o r a flight system may be different f r o m that experienced\nduring these tests. Differences could result from changes in reactor-loop heat capacity\no r changes in reactor temperature coefficients of reactivity. The coefficients used during\nthese tests w e r e those of the SNAP-8 development reactor. The coefficients expected f o r\na flight-type reactor would provide closer control of temperature and therefore tend t o\nreduce the stabilization time.\nEffect of ramp duration. - After the stabilization period, the system is ramped t o\nfull power operation. During the t e s t program, the duration of the power ramp was\nvaried from 500 t o 1000 seconds. Figure 17 shows reactor-simulator inlet and outlet\ntemperature, reactor-simulator power, and m e r c u r y flow as a function of time for a\n500-second power ramp. The curves indicate a smooth transition from self -sustaining\nt o rated power operation. The minor irregularities i n reactor simulator outlet temper\xc2\xad\na t u r e and power are due to the stepping action of the simulated r e a c t o r control. The\nreactor could easily tolerate a r a m p of this duration. Power ramps even less than\n500 seconds in duration may be compatible with the load-following capabilities of the\nreactor.\nProblems in condenser p r e s s u r e control, however, occurred during the 500 -second\npower ramp. It is observed from the condenser p r e s s u r e curve in figure 18 that these\nproblems began at approximately 360 seconds into the ramp. Until this time, the con\xc2\xad\ndenser control had forced the condenser p r e s s u r e back into the dead band, 6 . 9 t o 9 . 7\nnewtons p e r square centimeter (10 t o 14 psia), whenever it exceeded the upper limit. An\nindication that the control was operating properly is the stepwise increase in coolant\nflow (fig. 18). After 360 seconds, however, the condensing p r e s s u r e remained above\nthe upper dead-band limit even though the control ramped the coolant flow upward in a\ncontinuous manner. This mode of operation indicates that the r a m p rate of the control\nwas too s m a l l f o r a 500-second power ramp, even though it was close t o the optimum\nvalue for the bootstrap operation previously discussed. Another problem occurred at\nabout 450 seconds into the ramp. At this time the control was unable to increase coolant\nflow since the maximum flow capability of the heat-rejection loop had been obtained. The\nresult was a further increase in condensing p r e s s u r e above the upper dead-band limit.\nThese two problems could be corrected to allow u s e of a 500-second power ramp.\nFirst, a variable ramp r a t e in coolant flow could be built into the condenser p r e s s u r e\ncontrol for compatability with both the bootstrap operation and a fast power ramp. In\naddition, the flow capability of the heat-rejection loop could be increased beyond that re\xc2\xad\nquired f o r steady-state rated power operation. This could be done by enlarging the loop\npiping o r modifying the pump. However, when the disadvantages of control complexity\n\n12\n\nY\n\nand either l a r g e r piping o r increased pumping power are considered, the m o r e attractive\nsolution is to slow down the mercury flow power ramp.\nA 900-second power ramp is shown in figure 19. For this power ramp, the control\nhad the s a m e coolant flow ramp rate as f o r the 500-second power ramp. It a l s o had the\ns a m e maximum flow limitation. Both w e r e sufficient for the 900-second power ramp.\nThe condenser p r e s s u r e was held within the dead band throughout the transient.\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nOne hundred thirty-five startup tests w e r e conducted on a SNAP-8 power conversion\nsystem coupled with a reactor simulator and radiator simulator. Both t h e relatively\nfast transient t o a self -sustained condition and the gradual transient that achieves rated\npower w e r e investigated. The investigations showed that dependable startup of the power\nconversion system can be ensured with procedures that will treat the reactor very gently.\nThe more specific results of the testing a r e as follows:\n1. Startup to the self-sustained level was successfully accomplished with mercury\nflow ramps up t o a maximum limit of 145 seconds in duration. The turbine power m a r \xc2\xad\ngin, however, for acceleration of the turbine-alternator and pumps to rated speed was\nl a r g e r f o r s h o r t e r ramps.\n2. For all durations used for the ramp in mercury flow t o the self-sustaining level\n(30 t o 145 sec), the maximum rates of temperature change at the inlet of the reactor\nsimulator w e r e always well within the specified acceptable values f o r the reactor. The\nsafety factor, however, increased with increasing ramp duration.\n3. Considering both the turbine power margin and the safety factor i n rate of change\nof reactor inlet temperature, a duration in the range of 80 to 100 seconds was selected\nas optimum f o r the ramp t o self-sustaining mercury flow. Ramps in this range had sub\xc2\xad\nstantial turbine power margin and a safety factor of 3 from the constraining value of rate\nof change of reactor inlet temperature.\n4. A simple dead-band control of condenser p r e s s u r e effectively coped with a wide\nrange of condenser conditions during the transient t o self-sustained operation. The con\xc2\xad\nt r o l is required to limit turbine back p r e s s u r e and t o maintain adequate mercury pump\nsuction p r e s s u r e .\n5. A 500-second mercury flow ramp from the self-sustaining level t o the rated\xc2\xad\n\n13 \n\n\npower level was very compatible with reactor-simulator load-following capabilities.\nSlowing the power ramp down t o 900 seconds enabled the condenser control t o perform\nsatisfactorily with a single ramp r a t e of condenser coolant flow f o r both phases of startUP.\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and S p a c e Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, March 24, 1971,\n120-27.\n\ni\n\n6 \n\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
