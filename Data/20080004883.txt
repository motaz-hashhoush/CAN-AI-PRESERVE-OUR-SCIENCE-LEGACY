The zinc-doped materials are reported to display\nphosphor is substantially equivalent to the molar amount of\nenhanced brightness and persistence compared to\ntrivalent rare earth metal ion (e.g., Dy3+). It is believed that\nSrA10,:Eu2\', Dy3+.\nthis type of substitution also reduces the charge defects\nEP published application 710,709 (Murayama et al.) 65 induced by substitution of the trivalent rare earth ion sites\nreports phosphors of matrix Ml.Jdz04.z where M is at least\ninto alkaline earth metal ion sites (e.g., Sr2\' sites) in the\none metal selected from calcium, strontium, barium and,\naluminate.\n\nPHOSPHORS WITH LONG-PERSISTENT\nGREEN PHOSPHORESCENCE\n\nUS 6,267,911 B3\n\n3\n\n4\n\nImprovements in phosphor properties, particularly phosphor brightness, are further achieved by codoping Y3+,La+3,\nLu-~,\nGd+3 and Bi3+ into the Eu2--activated, trivalent metal\nion-doped phosphor to replace alkaline earth metal ion (e.g.,\nSr\xe2\x80\x9d) in the host. Co-doping with Y+3is more preferred. The\namount of Y+3that can be introduced to replace the alkaline\nearth metal ion is up to three times the molar amount of other\ntrivalent rare earth metal ions (eg.,Dy3+).\nA separate aspect of this invention is the discovery that\napplication of a quenching step after sintering during the\nsynthesis of the alkaline earth aluminate phosphors results in\nphosphors with significantly improved properties. The phosphors produced using this quenching step exhibit improved\nbrightness and longer persistence than analogous phosphors\nprepared without use of the quenching step (non-quenched\nphosphors.)\nWithout wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it\nis presently believed that application of the quenching step\nto the phosphors of this invention after sintering results in\nthe formation of alkaline earth aluminate phosphor at least\nin part in the high temperature phase (D-phase). Phosphor\nmaterial prepared without such a quenching step is believed\nto be substantially in the lower temperature phase (a-phase).\nApplication of the quenching step in the synthesis of\nSrAI,O, matrix phosphors is believed to generate phosphors\ncontaining the high temperature phase, fl-SrAI,O,. Nonquenched SrAI,O, is believed to be substantially (50% by\nweight or more) in the a-phase. The specific quenching of\nSrAI,O, is accomplished by rapid cooling of the sintered\nmaterial from a temperature at or above about 650\xe2\x80\x9d C. to\nabout room temperature. The 0-phase-containing phosphors\nare believed to exhibit improved phosphorescence properties. With this view in mind, preferred phosphors are those\ncomposed substantially of 0-phase material (i.e., greater\nthan 50% by wt). More preferred are phosphors composed\nof greater than about 75% by wt. of 0-phase material.\nThis invention relates to phosphors, particularly to phosphors subjected to quenching during synthesis, to phosphors\nformed as ceramics and to methods of making improved\nphosphors by application of a quenching step to retain high\ntemperature phase material.\nIn general, the phosphors of this invention have a variety\nof applications for the manufacture of luminous materials,\nnight vision apparatus and in optoelectronic devices.\nThis invention also provides single crystal phosphors with\nlong persistence times. The crystals have a general formula\nMAI,O,, where M stands for Sr, Ca, Ba or a combination of\nSr, Ba, or Ca. These materials are doped with Eu\xe2\x80\x9d as an\nactivator, and co-doped with Dy3+, Nd3+, or other trivalent\nrare earth ions or Bi3+ (most generally R3+) or combinations\nof these ions. The trivalent metal ions are believed to act as\ntrapping centers. The single crystal phosphors can also be\nprepared from MAI,O,:EU~+, R3+in which Mg2+or Zn\xe2\x80\x9d are\nsubstituted for AI3+or in which Na+ or K+ (or other alkali\nmetal ions) are substituted for M2+ as charge compensators.\nThese crystals phosphoresce at wavelengths of 520 nm\n(SrAl,0,:Eu2-,Dy3+) or 440 nm (CaAl,0,:Eu2+,Nd3+) with\npersistence times longer than about 15 hours.\nThe single crystals of this invention have direct application to the manufacture of phosphorescent jewelry and\nrelated items for ornamentation or apparel. In addition, due\nto their strong phosphorescent properties, the crystals can\nhave important applications in optoelectronic technology,\nsuch as in image storage and in memory devices.\nThe oxide phosphors of this invention are chemically\nstable and believed to represent no significant hazard to the\nenvironment.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n5\n\n1s\n\n2o\n\n25\n\n3o\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n55\n\n60\n\nFIG. 1 illustrates the luminescent spectra of (a)\n0-SrAI,O4:O.02 Eu2+, 0.02 Dy3+ and the corresponding\na-phase material (b).
