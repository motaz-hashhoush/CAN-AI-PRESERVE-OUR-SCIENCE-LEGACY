The concept was evaluated in a series of  human-in-the-loop simulations to confirm concept benefits in terms of better schedule predictability, reduction of delays, and increased throughput, especially during convective weather. In addition, other conditions with mixed participation of multi-trajectories from the airlines were evaluated that showed significant benefits to the individual airlines as well as the overall traffic flow.\n\nThe IDM concept was initiated in the SMART-NAS project, was completed under the ATM-X project, and was developed collaboratively with the FAA and airline partners. Over the course of IDM development, NASA researchers produced 19 conference papers and publications. Outside supporting organizations, funded by IDM, produced 20 additional conference papers and publications, in which they advanced fundamental research on topics such as better stochastic traffic demand prediction, and application of machine learning techniques for modeling traffic management initiatives.\n\nFinal concept procedures and tool specifications have been transferred to the FAA Air Traffic Organization Operational Concepts, Validation, and Requirements group.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "", "submissionId": 20210021726, "name": "", "location": "", "id": "2440ed16acff401d8fe118ca3cbafef8", "url": ""}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210021726, "id": "ebfbca3d340347e4a23fe855f172f4fa", "publicationDate": "2021-09-16T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Techport - Final summary for IDM TC (002).pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210021726/downloads/Techport%20-%20Final%20summary%20for%20IDM%20TC%20(002).pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210021726/downloads/Techport%20-%20Final%20summary%20for%20IDM%20TC%20(002).pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210021726/downloads/Techport%20-%20Final%20summary%20for%20IDM%20TC%20(002).pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
