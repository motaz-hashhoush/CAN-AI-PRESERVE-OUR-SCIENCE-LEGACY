The major tasks of this program consisted of (1) fuel cell system studies of a space shuttle powerplant conceptual design (designated engineering model -1, EM-1) supported by liaison with the space shuttle prime contractors; (2) component and subsystem technology advancement and; (3) a demonstrator powerplant test. Fuel cell system studies, with the EM-1 as the focal point of design activities, included determination of voltage regulation, specific reactant consumption, weight, voltage level and performance characteristics. These studies provided the basis for coordination activities with the space shuttle vehicle prime contractor. Interface information, on-board checkout and in-flight monitoring requirements, and development cost data were also provided as part of this activity. Even though the two vehicles primes had different voltage requirements (115 volts in one case and 28 volts in the other), it was concluded that either option could be provided in the fuel cell power system by the electrical hook-up of the cells in the stack.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720022379, "id": "a52dfe9ec67f4ebfa881b7198a3b6757", "publicationDate": "1972-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720022379.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720022379/downloads/19720022379.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720022379/downloads/19720022379.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720022379/downloads/19720022379.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
