NASA has tried to alleviate this problem for ocean scientists, by initiating a program, the NASA Ocean Data System (NODS). The menu-based user interface that NODS employs allows a user to make request and receive answers within a short time of accessing the system. A catalog system, which holds information about oceanographic data sets may be queried to determine the suitability of a particular data set. Once a candidate data set is found, the user is directed to the person or place which actually holds the data. NODS also has an archive system that holds data from ocean-observing satellites. The archive may be queried to obtain a manageable data subset that can be delivered in a useful form.", "title": "Satellite data management for effective data access", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880051463, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hogan, Patrick D."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "98a57fe043f3426b9eee2f8e0d1c8f1b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880051463, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kotlarek, Thomas L."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "aa6bf643d62845d2b44c4c96d87cff48"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880051463, "endDate": "1987-02-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Conference on Data Engineering", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "2af5ac638e07470689041128de47d1ee", "startDate": "1987-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19880051463, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880051463, "id": "89063492f66f41629598a043b5edfe85", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
