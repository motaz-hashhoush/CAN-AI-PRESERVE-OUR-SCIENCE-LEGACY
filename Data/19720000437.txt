Because H'2. has- reducing: properties, it\nintroduces an undesirable amount of impurities- in the\nfilm. Thus, H 2 should. be replaced with an inert carrier\nsuch as helium, argon, or nitrogen to improve the\nquality of the film. This method. will permit the film to\nbe used for devices such as Gunn and LS-A which require\nhigh quality standards.\n\nPatent status.:\n\nNo patent action- is- contemplated: by NASA.\n\nSource: H'.- M'.
