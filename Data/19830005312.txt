Most solar cells, however, are produced from wafers sliced from\ncrystalliaie silicon ingots. Unfortunately, the cost of the slicing process is\na major part of the cost of producing silicon sheet, Any attempt to reduce\nthe cost of photovoltaic modules, (herefore, must involve the development of\nless expensive wafering technologies.\nThis study presents the current status (1981) of the inside-diameter\nsawing, (ID),\' multiblade sawing (MBS) and fixed-abrasive slicing technique\n(FAST) processes with respect to the estimated price each process adds on to\nthe price of the final photovoltaic module. The expected improvements in each\nprocess, based on the knowledge of the current level of technology, are\nprojected for the next two to five years and the expected add-on prices in\n1983 and 1986 are estimated. Assuming that the projected progress is made,\nthe ID and FAST processes are expected to achieve the price allocation of\n$18.15/m2 for square ingots and $13.70/m 2 for circular ingots to conform\nwith the earlier price goal of the Flat-Plate Solar Array Project (FSA) of\n$0.70/Wp of PV module (price estimates are expressed in 1980 dollars). MBS\ntechnology projections, however, indicate that its progress will not be\nsufficient to achieve the allocated price goal before 1986.\nsy\n\ntJG\np, =J PAGE BLANK NO\n\nv\n\nT FtLULt\n\n;,\n\nF\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe advanced inside-diameter (ID), multi.blade slurry (MISS) and\nfixed-abrasive slicing technique (FAST) processes for slicing square and\ncircular cross-section silicon ingots into wafers are being developed,\nrespectively, by Silicon Technology Corp. of Oakland, New Jersey, Norlin \t\nIndustries, Inc., of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and Crystal Systems, Inc., of\nSalem, Massachusetts. These development efforts are being carried out for the\nU.S. Department of Energy-sponsored Flat-Plate Solar Array Project (FSA) at\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Based on the FSA priceoal of $0.70/Wp of\nPV module, the price allocation for wafering is $1^3.7/J of circular ingot\nwafers and $18.15/m2 of square ingot wafers. (Prices are expressed in 1980\ndollars.) Tha price goal is set to male the conversion of solar energy by\nphotovoltaic technology economically competitive.\n\nw\n\nFSA Project efforts for the last fi g*e years in developing the ingot\ngrowth and wafering technologies have yielded positive and encouraging\nresults. Commensurate with the achievements in Cz ingot growth, the\nadvancements made in wafering technologies during this period are also\nimpressive. Automation has resulted in reducing the labor requirement. The\nintroduction of automatic wafer recovery and blade deflection control\nmechanisms have improved the yields in ID technology. Ingots as large as 15\ncm in diameter are being sliced. The wafering workshop organized by FSA in\n.\nPhoenixAriz-ono in June 10 8 1 was effective in bringing to g et he r the tec hnical\ncommunity involved in various phases of wafering, identifying critical\nproblems and exchanging ideas.\nFor ID technology, based on industry survey, the add-on price for a 5-MW\nfactory using 1980 and 1982 technologies are of the order of $80/m and \t\n$40/m2 respectively. For the MBS and FAST technologies the price estimates\nbased on laboratory data are of the order of $180/m z.\n\n1\n\nThe present study, based on the current level of technology (1981),\nreports ,price estimates for wafering; 10-cm square and 15-cm-dia round ingots,\nusing each of the three slicing methods. Assuming that development efforts\nare cantinued, prices are also estimated using the projected levels of\ntechnology for 1983 and 1986.\nUsing the 1981 ID technology and assuming certain production levels, the\nprice is estimated to be of the order of $50/m 2 for slick:\' g 10 cm square\ningots. This price is expected to be reduced to the order of $10/m 2 by the\nyear 1986, with continued development. The price estimates for slicing 15 cm\ndiameter round ingots are of the order of $38/m2 and $9/m2 using the 1981\nand 1986 technologies respectively.\nThe results of the analysis indicate that both ID and FAST technologies\nare likely to achieve the price allocation goal during the period 1983 to\n1986. The projections for MBS technology, however, indicate that this time\nframe may not be sufficient for this particular technology to achieve the\nprice allocation. A shift in emphasis of FSA goals has resulted in\ndiscontinuation of federal support for the development of these\nsilicon-slicing technologies. Obviously, if the development efforts decrease,\nthe time required for the ID and FAST technologies to achieve the price\nallocation is likely to be prolonged.\nvii PRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nr;\n\ni\n\nf\n\nCk,\n\nThe price goals are still valid for the photovoltaic industry to be\ncompetitive with conventional energy sources. It may be for the private\nindustries to take up the challenge to continue working toward the achievement\no g these goals. The analysis presented is help gul in identifying the critical\nfactors and the direction of developmental efforts.\n\nvii.i\n\nCONTENTS\n\n. . .\t\n\n, . . . . . . . .\t\n\nI.\t\n\nINTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . , . .\t\n\nII.\t\n\nADD-ON PRICE ESTIMATION PROCEDURE . . . , . . . . \t\n\n. . . . . . .\t\n\n3\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n5\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n5\n\nIII.

These ingots then are sliced into\nwafers. The technologies that are considered in this analysis are advanced\ninside-diameter sawing (XD), ,nultiblade slurry sawing (MBS) and fixedabrasive slicing technique (FAST).\nThe Flat-Plate Solar Array Project (FSA), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energyp has been responsible for the development of the sequential\ntechnologies needed to manufacture photovoltaic modules: production of\npurified silicon, its slicing into wafers, cell fabricationp encapsulation,\nand module assembly. The Project\'s goal was to develop the appropriate technologies to achieve the price goal of $0.70/W (all prices, throughout this\ndocument, are given in 1980 dollars) by the year tyao.\nThe ID, MBS, and FAST technologies for the production of silicon wafers\nhave been under development during the last five years. The price goal of\n$0.70/W\'p translates into a price allocation of $27.4/m 2 of round wafers obtained\nby slicing ingots grown by the Cz process and $36.3/m 2 of square wafers obtained\nby slicing ingots grown by the HEM process (Reference 1). The price allocation\nfor wafers derived from Cz ingots is less than that for wafers obtained from\nHEM ingots becauoe of the lower packing efficiency (789) of round wafers compared to that of square wafers (95X). The prise allocations include the add-on\nprice for growing ingots and the add-on price for the production of wafers.\nIf we assume that half ofthis price allocation is for the production of\nwafers, this comes to $13.70/m 2 for circular wafers and $18.15/m 2 for square\nwafers at the slicing rate of 23 to 25 slices/cm. If the parametric .goal of\n23 to 25 slices/cm is not achieved, more material will be required per unit\narea of wafer. The add -on price for ingot growth will increase correspondingly, resulting in a lower price allocation for slicing.\nFor the semiconductor industry ingots grown by the Cz process are in the\nsmaller size range of 7.5 cm to 10 cm dia. To achieve an ingot-growth price\nof the order of $14/kg, it is necessary to grow ingots of larger size\n(Reference 2). Efforts are under way to grow ingots as large as 15 cm in\ndiameter. Ing,, tts grown by the HEM process are cast and measure 30 x 30 x 30\ncm. These ingoL ,,. are sectioned into 10 x 10 x 30-cm ingots. The production\nof wafers from 15 -cm-dia round Cz-grown ingots and 10-cm square HEM ingots are\nconsidered in the analysis.\n\nThe advanced IC sawing process is being developed by Silicon Technology\nCorp. (STC) of Oakland, New Jersei \xe2\x96\xba . The ingot is passed through the inner\nspace of an annular blade that has its cutting edge on the internal edge.\nRotating at high speed, the blade cuts the ingot into wafers.\nThe MSS sawing process is hei.ng developed by Norlin Industries, Inc \xe2\x96\xba , of\nCarlisle, Pennsylvania * A act of blades (numbered in hundreds) is fixed with\nsuitable spacers into a blade head. Depending on the machine design, either\nthe blade head or the workpiece (an entire ingot) is moved reciprocally to\nslice the ingot into wafers. Silicon carbide particles in a slurry are used\nas abrasive.\nThe FAST sawing process is being developed by Crystal Systems, Incv, of\n\nSalem, Massachusetts. In this process, steel wires impregnated wth digs,\xe2\x80\x9e;ond\nparticles are used for slicing the ingot, A set of wires suitably spacrl is\nfixed in a head that is moved reciprocally to cut the ingot into wafers,\nBased on industry survey for a 5-MW factory, add-on prices for ID\nwafering using 1980 and 1982 technologies are estimated to be of the order of\n$80/m 2 and $40/m2 respectively (Reference 3). The add-on price estimates\nfor MBS and FAST technologies using 1980 laboratory data are of the order of\n$180/m 2 (Refer(ince 4). Sensiltivity analysis of add on prices for wafering\nsilicon ingott using advanced \'\'ID, Mt$$ ind FAST processes is presented in an\nearlier study (Reference 5).\nAdd^orx prices uttr ibult-e ho the production of wafers are estimated using\nthe Interim Price Estimation Guidelines procedure (IPEG-2) (Reference 6).\nThese add-on prices are expressed in 1980 dollars using the appropriate\ncoefficients of the Improved Price Estimation Guidelines (IPEG).\nDetails of the IPEG equations used are given in the next section. The\nprice-estimation results are presented in the subsequent section, and a\nsummary is provided in the last section. The data used in the analysis for\neach of the silicon wafer production technologies are given in Appendix A.\n\ns\t\n\n\t\n2\n\n;r\n\n:\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSECTION 11\nADD - ON PRICE\n\nESTIMATION PROCEDURE\n\nAid-on prices for each of the three wafer-production processes\nconsidered (ID 9 MBS and FAST) are lcalculated using the IPEG-2 equati on\n(Reference 3). The IPEG equation computes the average annual cost of\nproducing a certain quantity of a product using a particular process * Twenty\npercent of return on investment is included in the estimation of average\nannual revenue; the latter also is referred to as Annual. Manufacturing Cost\n(AMC). More accurate price estimates can be obtained by using the simulation\nprocedure of the Standard Assembly-Line Manufacturing Industry Simulation\n(SAMIS) (Reference 7) and the Solar Array Manufacturing Industry Costing\nStandards (SAMICS) (Reference 8) which is more expensive to use, requiring\nmore computer time. In estimating the add-on price for a single process, or\ncomparing prices for alternative processesp the IPEG procedure is considered\nto be sufficiently accurate.\nThe AMC is expressed as a summation of the following linear functions:\n(1)\n\nEQPT: total installed cost of the equipment (I).\n\n(2)\n\ng\nAtEA area required by the process equipment and its operators\n(ft2)\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(3)\n\nDLAB: annual cost of direct labor ($/yr).\n\n(4)\n\nMATS: annual cost of materials and supplies ($/yr).\n\n(5)\n\nUTIL: annual cost of utilities ($/yr).\n\nThe equation used i, s:\nE\nF\n\nAMC - Cl x EQPT + C2 x AREA + C3 x DLAB + C4 x (MATS + UTIL) \t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nCl = The coefficient corresponding to EQPT, a function of equipment\nlifetime (ELT); it declines as the ELT increases.

A reduction in the AMC is\nalso expected to be achieved by a reduction in labor cost as a result of\nautomation; the number of mtachinas per oparator will increase from 5 to 10.\nIn addition, the price of cacti blade is expected to Ctrl reduced From $90 to $60\n\nand Chit blade\n\nlife i s\n\nexpected\n\nto\n\nincrease from\n\n2000 to 5000 slices.\n\nSimilarly, the estimated add-on price using current technology and as\nmachine capable of slicing two ingots simultaneously in l27.50/m 2 . lly 1983, this\nprice is expected to bat reduced to $16.61/m2 by increasing throughput through\nincrease in slices/cm (from 11 to 20) and slicing rate (from 51 arm/min to\n76 non /min). The reduction in MIC will be accomplished by a decrease in the\n\nprice of cacti blade from $120 to $100 and an increase in blade life front 1500\nslices to 30004 Labor cost also is expected to be reduced by increasing the\n\n^a\na\n\n5\nX\n\nTable 1.

Obviously t the reduction of\nwafer thickness (increased slices/cm) results in obtaining more sheet area\nfrom the same size ingot. This then has direct impact on ingot growth cost\nand the price allocation for sheetp which includes both ingot growth and the\nproduction of wafers.\nBy 1986, the multiple-ingot-slicing saw is expected to .slice three ingots\nsimultaneously, resulting in a further reduction in price to $6.20/m 2 . Projections show improvements in throughput parameters such as slices/cm (expected to\nbe increased to 23) and the slicing rate, expected to increase to 102 mm/min.\nAlso expected to be improved are equipment cost (to be reduced from $70 9 000 to\n$50,000 for each. machine) and blade price (expected to be reduced from $100 to\n$80 each). The blade life is expected to be increased from 3000 slices to 5000\nslices.\nThe following observations may be made from tl\'a\xc2\xb0 price breakdown in terms\nof the costs given in Table 1. The equipment cost amounts to approximately 30%\nof the price (28% to 36%). Area cost amounts to approximately 10% (7% to 16%).\nThe utilities cost amounts to only 1% to 2%. The balance of contributions to\nthe price is shared by direct labor cost and materials cost. The labor contribution is reduced from 45% for the case of one ingot in 1981 to 19% for the\ncase of three ingots in 1986. Correspondingly, the material cost of 12% for\nthe single ingot example in 1981 is increased to 41% for the case of three\ningots in 1986.\nThe price estimates and the relevant data for the slicing of single and\nmultiple 15-cm-dia round ingots are presented in Table 2. Multiple ingot\nslicing was not attempted in 1981\xe2\x80\xa2 Projections are made, however, of data for\nslicing two ingots simultaneously by the years 1983 and 1986. The price estimates are encouraging. With 1981 technology, the price estimate for slicing a\nsingle ingot is $37.60/m 2 . The price is expected to be reduced to $6.56/m2\nby 1986 by slicing two ingots simultaneously. The throughput by 1986 also is\nexpected to be increased by increasing the slices/cm from 17 to 20 t the slicing\nrate from 44 to 102 mm/min, and the yield from 95% to 98%. Equipment cost is\nexpected to be reduced from $70,000 to $50,000 for each machine. Machines per\noperator are expected to be increased from 5 to 10y and the blade life to be\nincreased from 2000 to 3000 slices.\nThe price breakdown, in terms of cost parameters, is similar to the case\nfor 10-cm square ingots. Equipment cost contributes about 35% to 46%, area\ncosts from 8% to 15%, and utilities cost from 1% to 2%. The contribution of\ndirect labor cost (37% for present technology) could be reduced to 22% by\n1986; correspondingly, the contribution of 12% from materials for present\ntechnology will increase to 30% by 1986.\nIf development efforts are continued by industry and the technical\nparameters (slices/cm, slicing rate, yield, blade life, etc.) are achieved as\nper the projections, ID technology would meet the price allocation guidelines.\n\nB.\t\n\nMBS\n\nThe multiblade sawing technology, however, needs considerable\ndevelopment to achieire the price allocation for the production of wafers.\n\n7\n\ny\n\np\t\n\n^^\n\n0\n\nTable 2.

Projections are made for slicing 15-cm-dia round\nsingle ingots by 1983 and 1986. It is not practical to project the data for\nslicing multiple ingots simultaneously because of lack of experience. The\nprice estimates and the relevant data for slicing 10-cm square and 15-cm-dia\nround ingots are presented in Table 3.\nThe Kidd-on price of $52.87/m2 for slicing 10-cm square ingots using\n1981 technology is expected to be reduced to $32.29/m 2 by the year 1986.\nThe material cost is the primary cost factor, contributing 57% to 64% to the\nprice. Material cost includes both the blade pack and the abrasive slurry\ncosta. The price estimate of $33.29/m 2 by 1986 is almost twice that of the\nprice allocation of $18.15/m2 for square ingots.\nSimilarly, by 1983, the price for slicing 15-cm-dia round ingots, one at\na time, is estimated to be $51.58/m 2 . It is expected to be reduced to $29.98/m2\nby 1986 9 compared with the price allocation of less than $13.70/m 2 for circular\ningots sliced at 17 to 19 slices/cm. In this case, the material cost contribution is in the range of 33% to 49%. The price could be reduced by increasing\nthe throughput. It is not now possible, however, to project an increase in the\nslicing rate unless there is a breakthrough in slurry usage that results in\ncost reduction. Unless it becomes possible to slice two to three ingots simultaneously, with all other parameters remaining the same, it will be difficult\nfor the MBS technology to achieve the price allocation.\n\nC.\t\n\nFAST\n\nThe FAST machine, with two blade heads that can be operated at the same\ntime, is designed to slice two ingots simultaneously. Development efforts now\nare limited to slicing only one ingot at a time. This technology needs\ndevelopment to achieve sustained high yields. Because of current (1981) low\nyields and high labor content of one machine per operator, the price estimates\nusing 1981 data are abnormally high. Based on present technology and experience, however, and assuming that developmental efforts continue, the data for\nslicing two 10-cm square ingots and 15-cm-dia round ingots are projected for\n1983 and 1986. The price estimates and the relevant data are presented in\nTable 4.\nThe price for slicing two 10-cm square ingots simultaneously is expected\nto be $20.32/m2 by 1983 and to be reduced to $6.68/m 2 by 1986. Slices/em\nare expected to be increased from 19 to 25 and the slicing rate by 0.10 to\n0.15 mn/min. Equipment cost is expected to be reduced from $50,000 to $35,000\neach. Machines per operator are expected to be increased from 5 to 10, the\nwire pack price to be reduced from $150 to $100 per twin pack and the wire\npack life to increase from 3 runs to 5. If the developmental efforts are\ncontinued and are successful, and if all of these projections are achieved by\n1986, the price estimate of $6.68/m 2 is attractive and the technology\nappears to be promising.\n\n9\n\nTable 3.

All other improvements are expected to be the\nsame as those for 10-cm square ingots.\nFor both 10-cm square ingots and 15-cm-dia round ingots the price\nestimates for 1986 are attractive and meet the price allocation.\n\nq\n\nA\n\nj\n12\n1\n\nSECTION IV\nSUMMARY\n\nDevelopmental efforts by FSA for the past five years have resulted in\ntechnology with increased automation, reduced labor, automatic wafer recovery\ntechniques better blade deflection control mechanism and improved yields.\nIngots as large as 15 cm in diameter are being sliced by ID technology. The\nwafering workshop held in June 1981 in Phoenix, Arizona, sponsored by FSA has\nbeen responsible for bringing the technical community involved in various\nphases of wafering together in one place. This workshop was helpful in\nidentifying the critical problems and in the exchange of ideas.\nBased on industry survey for a 5-MW Factory, add-on prices for ID\nwafering using 1980 and 1982 technologies are estimated to be of the order of\n$80/m2 and $40 / m2 respectively ( Reference 3). The add-on price estimates\nfor MBS and FAST technologies using 1980 laboratory data are of the order of\n$180/m2 (Reference 4). A sensitivity analysis of add-on prices for wafering\nsilicon ingots using advanced ID, MBS and FAST process is presented in an\nearlier study (Reference 5).\nA compari^ion of the price estimates for slicing 10-cm square ingots and\n15-cm-dia round ingots by using ID, MBS, and FAST technologies is presented in\nTable 5. Price ost i m. tes are b ; IT\n-en both for present te chno logy for each of\nthe three methods of slicing considered and for the projected levels of each\nof the technologies for the years 1983 and 1986. These results are presented\nin Table 6 in ascending order, according to the year of technology.\nCompared with the price allocation of $18.15/m 2 for square ingots,\nboth the ID and FAST );echnologies are expected not only to meet the price\nallocation but to do better. The prices are estimated to be in the range of\n$9.7 to $6.7/m2 by 1986. Similarly, for round ingots, both ID and FAST\ntechnologies are expected to achieve the price allocation of $13.70/m 2 by\n1986. The prices are estimated to be in the range of $10 to $6.6/m2.\nConventional MBS technology is not capable of achieving the price allocation\nby 1986 for either square or round wafers. Efforts may have to be made to\nattain multiple-ingot slicing at a faster rate and with reduced material\nrequirement for MBS technology to achieve the price allocation.\n\n13\n\nTable 5.
