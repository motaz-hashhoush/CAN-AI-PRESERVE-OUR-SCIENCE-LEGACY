Puerto Rico came about because during Skylab-2 photography the\n\nsatellite was some 135 kilometers (73 nautical miles) west of its\n\nnominal fixed track, but later during Skylab-4 photography the satellite\n\nwas on its nominal track.\n\nThe fortuitously- complete coverage of Puerto\n\n\n-\n\n1\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nRico came about also because the Skylab\'s track azimuth was about\n\n137 degrees true, or southeastward, over an island oriented east-west.\n\nThus the image of the island lies diagonally across the image format.\n\nPuerto Rico is big enough (3435 square statute miles) and high\n\nenough (maximumnelevation 1338 meters, or 4390 feet) to have consider\xc2\xad\nable precipication and river runoff.\n\nThus river-mouth plumes and\n\n\ncoastal zones of sediment-laden water prevail, and they are conspicious\n\non-the satellite imagery.\n\nThey have considerable potential as indica\xc2\xad\n\ntors of near-shore coastal currents, knowledge of which has considerable\n\npractical importances in matters of coastal erosion and effluent dis\xc2\xad\npersal.\n\nRepetitive coverage closely spaced in time would be necessary\n\n\nfor their detailed study, however.\n\nPuerto Rico is surrounded and connected to the northern Virgin\n\nIslands by an insular shallow-water shelf much of which is less than\n\n30 meters deep.\n\nThe predominantly coralline sand on the shelf,\n\n\nespecially east, south, and west of the island, has high light reflec\xc2\xad\ntance.\n\nA wide variety of shoals, sand waves, and other features of\n\n\nbottom topography is thus prominent in the images made by light of\n\nwavelengths that penetrate water.\n\nThe coastal environment of Puerto Rico is highly stressed.\nisland is heavily populated and heavily industrialized.\n\nThe\n\n\nMost bulk\n\n\ncargoes are moved by sea, and considerable dredging of channels and\n\nharbors has been done.\n\nCoastal erosion is a severe problem,\n\nThe\n\n\nresolution of Skylab\'s imagery is inadequate for direct studies of\n\ncoastal erosion, but a number of what seem clearly to be oil slicks\n\n\n2\xc2\xad\n\nwere detected, and the imagery is of great value as a benchmark\n\nrecord of the coastal status of the entire island.\n\nMethods of interpretation have been those of classical direct\n\nphoto-interpretation.\n\nIn general, third-generation transparencies\n\n\nwere studied through a wide-field microscope at 10 diameters magnifi\xc2\xad\ncation.\n\nEnhancement of photographic images by such techniques as\n\n\ndensity slicing, microdensitometry, and the use of additive viewers\n\nhas not been done.\n\nApplications of such techniques to this imagery\n\n\nwould result in further information extraction, particularly by com\xc2\xad\nparing line microdensitometry profiles with bathymetric profiles as\n\nan aid in differentiating bathymetric and turbid-water imdges, and\n\nin comparing density-sliced images showing bathymetric detail with\n\nactual contours of bottom topography.\nbe done when time allows.\n\nit is hoped that such work can\n\n\nComputer ratioing of various bands of the\n\n\nmultispectral scanner (S192) imagery in this area to compare with\n\nknown bathymetry is being done by Fabian C. Polcyn of the Environ\xc2\xad\nmental Research Institute of Michigan.\n\nA copy of National Ocean Survey nautical chart No. 920l/covering\n\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is to be found in the pocket at\n\nthe end of this report.\n\nIt is for use in locating place-names and\n\n\ngiving an overall concept of the extent of shallow-water areas around\n\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\n\n\n1/ Recently renumbered to No. 25640\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\n\nThe Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) made data\n\npasses over the Puerto Rico - Virgin Islands area three times, as\n\nfollows:\nLocal time\n\nDate\n\nPass\n\n9 June 73\n\n1116\n\nSkylab 2\n\n6\n\nSkylab 4\n\n54\n\n30 Nov\n\n73\n\n1243\n\nSkylab 4\n\n85\n\n18 Jan\n\n74\n\n1649\n\nPuerto Rico\'s skies are only infrequently wholly clear of clouds,\n\nand partial cloud cover prevails.\n\nWe were fortunate that of the three\n\n\nSkylab passes that imaged Puerto Rico, only 15 percent of the coastline\n\nwas obscured by clouds and shadows on 9 June 1973, and 35 percent was\n\nobscured both on 30 November 1973 and on 18 January 1974.\n\nOther data sources were 1) Multispectral photography by a NASA\n\nWB57F aircraft at a nominal radar-determined flight height of 62,000\n\nfeet (18,900 meters) of all Puerto Rican (excepting the Isla de Mona)\n\nand nearly all Virgin Islands coasts;\n\n2) Light-plane flights at\n\n\naltitude ranging from 1500 to 12,000 feet (457 to 3660 meters) of all\n\nthe Puerto Rican and St. Croix coast for visual observation and photo\xc2\xad\ngraphy by 35-mm hand-held cameras; and\n\n3) ship-bourne measurement of\n\n\ncolor, transparency and temperature, and sampling for laboratory\n\ndetermination of salinity and amount of suspended sediment of coastal\n\nand oceanic waters near Puerto Rico.\n\nIn addition, all Earthsat-l\n\n\nimages of Puerto Rico were on hand, as was an extensive collection of\n\nbathymetric data on the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands shelf.\n\n\nA L 5 o& all &W\n\noPacv8\n\n;s, nvexf \'1v AffpeAID iX-A\n\nEREP sensors used were the S-90A Multispectral Photographic\n\nCamera, the Sl90B Earth Terrain Camera, and the 8192 Multispectral\n\nBrief technical descriptions of them follow.\n\nScanner.\n\nMore detailed\n\n\nInformation on Skylab instrumentation may be found in two reports by\n\nNASA (1972, 1973), and on the RB57F instrumentationmin another NASA\n\nreport (1971).\n\nThe Multispectral Photographic Camera (SI90A) is an array of six\n\nboresighted high-precision cameras with matched f/2.8 lenses of 6-inch\n\nfocal length and an angular field of view of 21.20.

The upper left\n\nimage is color infrared and shows the effluent area called the great\n\nblue anomaly well, turbid water less well, and bathymetry rather\n\npoorly. Water penetration depth is about 50 feet (15 meters). The\n\nupper right image is plain color, and shows considerably more turbid\xc2\xad\nwater and bathymetric detail than the color infrared; water penetration\n\nis 60 to 65 feet (18 to 20 meters). The center left image is the 0.5\xc2\xad\n0.6 micrometer band and shows water penetration of 60 to 65 feet (18 to\n\n20 meters). The center right image is the 0.6-0.7 micrometer band; it\n\nis superior to the preceding bands in rendition of the effluent area.\n\nThe lower left image is the 0.7-0.8 micrometer infrared band. In this\n\nreproduction differentiation only between land and water is seen, but\n\non the original transparency the great blue anomaly is clearly seen.\n\nThe lower right image is the 0.8-0.9 micrometer infrared band, which\n\nshows shoreline details less well than the preceding band, but which\n\non the original transparency also shows the great blue anomaly.\n\n\ntb 4\n\n\nso\n\nR4\n\nAr\nurr\nA.m\nAH,\nHUH\nH.u\n.M.M.\n\nIM\n\n\n777\nun\n\n4d*q\n\nwmm771\n\nA.\nHUY\n\nI\n\n-rw\nH\nAN\n\n\nby a higher sea state north and south of Puerto Rico, though the\n\nfetch is much greater there than in the wind-shadow west of the\n\nisland.\nsharp.\n\nA boundary caused by sea-state differences would not be so\n\nNor is the albedo difference likely to be caused by differences\n\n\nin suspended sediment, for suspended-sediment values (measured on three\n\ncruises some months later but with consistent results) are as low in\n\nthe vicinity of the Isla de Mona, in the darker-colored area, as they\n\nare in the open sea north of Puerto Rico away from the influence of\n\nland, where the color is lighter.\n\nIt is thought most likely that the darker color generally down\xc2\xad\nwind of Puerto Rico is caused by a diffusion of small amount of oils\n\nfrom industrial and domestic wastes that are discharged into the Bahia\n\nde Mayaguez.\n\nIn the Bahia de Mayaguez itself is the most striking features\n\non any of the Skylab images.\n\nAn intensely dark blue, almost black,\n\nIt is most strongly developed just\n\n\narea occupies much of the Bahia.\n\noffshore from the city of Mayaguez, in and downwind of an area of\n\nknown discharge of oily waste water from tuna-packing plants and other\n\nindustries.\n\nThe boundary of the deep blue-colored area on the south\n\n\nis exactly at the location of a reef edge: depths in the lighter-colored\n\narea to the south are generally in the range 15 to 25 feet ( 5 to 8\n\nmeters), while depths in the deepest blue area are on the general order\n\nof 600 feet (183 meters).\n\nThe depth and intensity of blue in the dark\n\n\nblue area is clearly not a simple function of depth, however, for near\xc2\xad\nby areas of far deeper water are not at all such a deep blue color, and\n\n\n-\n\nIi\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nthe waters of the Bahia de Mayaguez were highly polluted that day.\n\nThe deep blue area is bounded and intruded on the north by\n\nextremely light-c6lored water, and the nature of the boundary between\n\nthem in interdigitating.\n\nThis light-blue area seem\xc2\xa7 clearly to be a\n\n\nsediment plume from the Rio Grande de Aiia-sco, for it is centered on\n\nit, extends downwind from it, and was photographed from low altitude\n\non the same day.\n\nIt had rained heavily in its valley prior to the\n\n\nSkylab pass - as it had not, incidentally, along Puerto Rico\'s north\n\nand south coasts, where only small river-sediment plumes were visible.\n\nIt seems clear that the anomalously deep blue\n\narea is caused by\n\n\nsome effluent on the surface of the water that changes the water t s\n\nspectral reflectance.\n\nThis is substantiated by the presence in shoal\xc2\xad\n\nwater light-colored areas nearby to the south of long, narrow lineations\n\nthat also register as dark blue.\n\nThey are distinctive in form and are\n\n\ngenerally known as oil slicks, though it is not known whether they are\n\nof direct organic origin, or pollution.\n\nThey are commonly seen in the\n\n\nBahia de Mayaguez, and were observed there earlier on the same day the\n\nSkylab images were made.\n\nNumerous dark blue patches and streaks close\n\n\nto the city of Mayaguez are also probably oil slicks; many were observed\n\nin that area earlier in the day.\n\nColor variations within the light-blue area south of the anomalous\n\ndark blue area and north of the prominant cloud mass that obscures some\n\nof the western coastline compares fairly well with the known bathymetry\n\nof the area, but the details are sharper and the correspondence between\n\nimage color and actual depth is closer on both the Sl90A and the Sl90B\n\ncolor images than on the color infrared image.\n\n-\n\n12\n\nThis substantiates the\n\n\ngeneral finding (Lukens, 1968; Helgeson, 1970; Kelly and Castiglione,\n\n1970; Berryhill, 1969, and others) that color photographs result in\n\nbetter water penetration because wavelengths below 0.5 micrometers,\n\nin the spectral region where water penetratib nis gret\'est,,-do not\n\nappear on the color infrared images.\n\nA linear light-colored zone oriented about 1000 true just north\xc2\xad\nwest of the cloud mass that obscures the coastline extends across a\n\nbathymetrically flat area.\nflights earlier in thb day.\nphenomenon, and iti\n\nIlnot\n\nIt was not observed during light-plane\n\nIt is neither a ship\'s wake nor a plume\n\naligned with local surface winds.\n\nIts\n\n\norigin is unknown.\n\nThe outer edge of the insular shelf shows clearly through the\n\nare from northwest fo south of Cabo Rojo (the southwestern corner of\n\nPuerto Rico).\n\nThe color contrast is strongest in the arc from north\xc2\xad\n\nwest to west of Cabo Rojo, and becomes progressively weaker to the\n\nsouthwest and south,\n\nThis corresponds to the bathymetry, for pre\xc2\xad\n\nvailing minimum shelf-edge depths are in the general range 35 to 40\n\nfeet in the sector northwest to west of Cabo Rojo, but are generally\n\nsomewhat deeper southwest and south of Cabo Rojo.\n\nThis area may be\n\n\nused to establish the maximum penetration depth of S190A color infrared\n\nphotography in relatively clear water at about 50 feet (15 meters).\n\nIn all depths the detail and resolution of underwater features on- color\n\ninfrared images is clearly inferior to that on the high-resolution\n\ncolor images.\n\nAlong the south coast of Puerto Rico the S190A color infrared\n\nimages shows little turbidity or bathymetric detail.\n\n- 13 \xc2\xad\n\nCoastal waters\n\n\nare prevailing somewhat turbid there, though at the time of Pass 6\n\n\nthe turbidity was at a minimum.\n\nStill, much near-shore turbidity as\n\n\nwell as bathymetry is visible in the SI90A and SI90B color images.\n\nMaximum water penetration on the color-infrared image was on the order\n\nof 20 feet (6 meters) along the sduth coast.\n\n-\n\nIn the Bahia de Ponce on the color infrared as well as the color\n\nimages, linear light-color areas oriented northwest-southeast appear.\n\nThey have no relation to the trend of the bathymetry, and they lie\n\nabout parallel to the local surface wind.\n\nThey are most strongly\n\n\ndeveloped and touch land only in the vicinity of the tuna-canning plants\n\nand other industrial operations at Playa de Ponce.\n\nThey are probably\n\n\noil slicks from that source, even though they photographed lighter than\n\nthe water whereas somewhat similar slicks near Mayaguez photographed\n\ndarker than the water.\n\nLight-plane low-altitude observations substanti\xc2\xad\n\nate their suggested origin.\n\nWhat appear on the images to be dark oil slicks inshore southeast\n\nof the Playa de Ponce and south of Punta Cuchara (west of the Playa de\n\nPonce) are in reality shadows of diffuse clouds.\n\n\nThe SI90A color film has both higher resolution and better water\n\npenetration than the color infrared.\n\nThe open-ocean streaks thought\n\n\nto be langmuir cells are more readily visible, boat wakes are sharper,\n\nand both batbymetry and coastal turbidity are far better shown.\n\nOn the north coast, the small sediment plume from the Rio Grande\n\nde Arecibo, only faintly detectable on color infrared, is well shown\n\non the color film, including an offshore development of the plume that\n\n\n- 14 \xc2\xad\n\nshows by its sharp western and diffuse eastern boundaries (as well\n\nas by its general shape) that it is wind-driven to the westward.\n\nSubmarine sandspits that extend westward from the west side of rocky\n\nspurs and the east side of concavities in the shoreline prove that\n\nlongshore drift is westward, and represent-potential sources of sand\n\nfor industrial use.\n\nThese sandspits are also only faintly visible\n\n\non the color infrared.\n\n. Near Aguadilla the color image shows both minor sediment plumes\n\nand minor oil slicks driven offshore from the west coast by the north\xc2\xad\neast wind.\n\nThe oil slicks are slightly less than a mile long and are\n\n\njudged (by comparison with the runway width of the nearby airport,\n\npreviously Ramey Air Force Base) to be well under 100 meters wide.\n\nThese slicks are well above the size detection limit for S190A photo\xc2\xad\ngraphy, thus proving the utility of such orbital photography for detec\xc2\xad\ntion of slicks of small dimensions under favorable illumination circum\xc2\xad\nstances.\n\nThis particular area demonstrates the importance of sun azimuth\n\nfrom the photo center in the detection of sediment plumes and especially\n\nof oil slicks.\n\nOn frame 180 (see figure 1 for frame coverage) the\n\n\nAguadilla area is in the northeastern part of the image, and the sun\'s\n\nazimuth from the photo center is also northeastward, as shown clearly\n\nby cloud-cloud shadow relations.\n\nThus the Aguadilla area is up-sun\n\n\nfrom the photo center,-- and the plumes are hardly visible and the\n\nslicks are invisible.\n\nOn frame 181, on the other hand, the azimuth\n\n\nof the Aguadilla area from the photo center is northwestward, and\n\n\n-\n\n15\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nthe sun 1 s azimuth is of course stfl northeastward; the two frames\n\nwere exposed only 18 seconds apart.\n\nThus on frame 181 the Aguadilla\n\n\narea is in a cross-sun direction, and the plumes and slicks are well\n\nshown.\n\nWe can thus draw the general conclusion that in orbital as\n\n\nwell as aerial photography, plume and especially slick ,detection\n\nefficiency is a direct function of the relation between sun azimuth\n\nand target-area azimuth from the photo center.\nIn the Bahia de Mayaguez, all features described above in the\ncolor infrared discussion\n\nthe deep blue area, sediment plumes,\n\n-\n\nbathymetry, and oil slicks\n\n-\n\nlution on the color film.\n\nA critical difference is that the depth of\n\nare better shown and have increased reso\xc2\xad\n\nnear-surface bathymetric features is shown by apparent color variation\non the color film -- the shallowest features become increasingly light\n\ngreen --, whereas on the infrared film the depth of near-surface bathy\xc2\xad\nmetric features is shown only by variation in intensity of blue.\n\nThe\n\n\ndifference is striking, and the color film is far more useful in de\xc2\xad\nlineating details of shallow bathymetric features,-- in addition to\n\nwhich, its penetration is appreciably greater.\n\nEstimated maximum penetration depth (based on the depth of the\n\npoint on a sloping sea floor at which the sea-floor image becomes\n\nundetectable) is 60 to 65 feet (18 to 20 meters).\n\nDetails of bottom\n\n\ntopography are splendidly shown in depths up to about 40 feet (12\n\nmeters) in the Cabo Rojo area.\npenetration depth\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that

center is\n\n\n- 16 \xc2\xad\n\nmuch more than ninety degrees from the azimunt\n\nto the sun.\n\nEastward\n\n\nalong the south coast, penetration is markedly degraded because that\n\ndirection is more toward the sun\'s azimuth.\n\n\nIn general the S190A 0.5 to 0.6 micrometer imagery shows all\n\nfeatures observed on the S190A color photography, but the resolution\n\nof details is distinctly poorer and the film appears grainy under only\n\n10x magnification.\n\nA subjectively-judged similar degree of graininess\n\n\ndoes not appear on the color film until a magnification of at least\n\nabout 16x is reached.\n\nMaximum light penetration is judged about the\n\n\nsame (60-65 feet, 18-20 meters) as on the color film, or very slightly\n\nless, but fine detail in bottom topography is not so well rendered.\n\nSediment plumes are definitely less well rendered on the 0.5-0.6 micro\xc2\xad\nmeter imagery than on the color, and oil slicks are slightly less well\n\nrendered.\n\nThe 0.5-0.6 micrometer imagery appears to have no point of\n\n\nsuperiority over the high-resolution color imagery for direct photo\n\ninterpretation except when compared with images from other wavelengths.\n\n\nSI90A 0.6-0.7 micrometer imagery is superior to the 0.5-0,6 micro\xc2\xad\nmeter imagery in rendition of oil slicks and turbid water, and appears\n\nto be slightly superior to the color imagery in resolution of details\n\nof oil slicks, but slightly inferior in sediment-plume rendition.\n\nThe 0.6-0.7 micrometer imagery is of course markedly inferior to\n\nthe 0.5-0.6 micrometer imagery in water penetration due to the higher\n\nextinction coefficient for longer wavelengths in water.\ntration is estimated at 10 feet (3 meters).\n\n- 17 \xc2\xad\n\nMaximum pene\xc2\xad\n\nBut this becomes a virtue\n\n\nwhen the. otherwise difficult differentiation of the signatures of\n\nbathymetry and TL| ki0i-is\n\ndesired.\n\nTo e close approximation the\n\n0.6-0.7 micrometer imagery shows only water turbidity (except in very\n\nshallow areas), while the 0.5-0.6 micrometer and the color imagery\n\nwith their greater water penetrability show tbch turbidity and batty\xc2\xad\nmetry rather well.\n\nHence turbidity and bathymetric features, once\n\n\ndetected on 0.5-0.6 micrometer or color imagery, can in general be\n\nidentified by their presence or absence on the 0.6-0.7 imagery.\n\nIn summary, the 0.6-0.7 micrometer imagery is superior to color\n\ninfrared, color, and 0.5-0.6 micrometer images for detection and defini\xc2\xad\ntion of oil slicks, and is very useful in conjunction with the more\n\nwater-penetrative wavelengths in differentiating turbidity and bathyLetric\n\nsignatures.\n\n\nThe S190A 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9 micrometer imagery, being in the\n\ndeepest red and the near infrared respectively, show absolutely no\n\nbathymetry, though as is well known they portray the actual shoreline\n\nwith great clarity because of the extremely low water penetrability of\n\nthose wavelengths,\n\nHighly turbid water cannot be differentiated from\n\n\nclear ocean water,\n\nBut these wavelengths, particularly the 0.7-0.8 micrometer deepest\n\nred band, have the valuable property of differentiating oil slicks from\n\nall other observed water phenomena.\n\nResolution of detail of long narrow\n\n\nslicks is poor, but identification as oil slicks of such suspected oil\n\nslick areas as the great anomalous (deep blue on color film) area in\n\nthe Bahia de Mayaguez and the light-colored slicks near the Playa de\n\n\n- 18 \xc2\xad\n\nPonce is absolute because they, and they alone (excepting cloud\n\nshadows), appear in the water-covered areas on the 0.7-0,& micro\xc2\xad\nmeter imagery.\n\nThey can also be detected, but much more poorly,\n\n\non the 0.8-0.9 micrometer imagery.\n\nThe ability of the 0.7-0.8 micro\xc2\xad\n\nmeter image as a detector of oil slicks makes possible the identifica 1\'\n\ntion as an Gil slick of a previously unmentioned dark pattern in the\n\nnearshore waters directly south of the town of Jobos.\n\nA tanker un\xc2\xad\n\nloading terminal and an oil refinery are located in this area.\n\nPass 54,

bathymetric details are\n\nvisible on the color film,-but the two cannot be differentiated except\n\nby reference to other imagery.\n\nExamination by stereoscope of both\n\n\nthe SI90A and S190B color

color imagery shows\n\nboth bathymetry and an intermittent coastal belt of water turbidity.\n\nThe outlines of turbid water areas show the longshore drift to be west\xc2\xad\nward except within the Bahia de Ponce, where an apparent clockwise\n\ncurrent gyre shows northeastward coastal currents over a distance of\n\nabout 3 nautical miles (6 kilometers).\n\nAt the northwestern tip of the Isla de

far inferior\n\nto the Sl90A color imagery in revealing and resolving details of\n\nturbid water and bathymetry signatures, as was described in more de\xc2\xad\ntail in the preceding Pass 6 discussion.\n\nMaximum water penetration\n\n\nat 0.5-0.6 micrometers is only about 53 feet (16 meters).\n\nThe 0.8-0.9 micrometer image contains a surprise:\n\na faint image\n\n\nof the prominent

high-reflectance\n\ntarget in clear water, that depth of penetration at such long wave\xc2\xad\nlength is not to be expected (Sherman, 1971; Yost and Wenderoth, 1972).\n\n\nPass 85, 18 January 1974.--

resulted\n\nin serious degradation in the utility of the imagery from that pass.\n\nThe considerable horizontal displacement between any cloud or cloud\n\nfragment and its shadow prevents tracing a shadow back to the cloud\n\nthat caused it, and as a result numerous patterns in water-covered\n\nareas cannot be ascribed to a definite source except through knowledge\n\nof the features of the area gained from other passes.\n\nThe shadows of\n\n\nlarge cloud masses are displaced from the image of the cloud masses\n\nthemselves and totally obscure significant image detail in areas that\n\nqualify

and the waters adjacent to nearly all the island\'s\n\ncoasts that can be seen have a broad zone of high turbidity.\n\nThe rapid overall rate of flushing and exchange of Puerto Ricots\n\ncoastal waters is ,demonstrated by the low values for suspended sediment\n\nin them that were measured on several cruises between 4 and 12 days\n\nafter Pass 85 along the north coast and west of the island.\n\nThe prevailing coastal zone of turbid water masks many bathymetric\n\nfeatures visible in the same imagery from other passes.\n\nFurthermore\n\n\nthe low sun angle severely decreased water penetration in clear-water\n\narea.\n\nOn the SI90A color infrared image, penetration in the clear\xc2\xad\n\nwater around the west end of the Isla de Vieques is only something\n\non the order of 20 feet (6 meters), and on the color image it is only\n\non the order of 33 feet (10 meters).\n\n\nAgain on the Pass 85 images the overall superiority of color\n\nover color infrared imagery in water-covered areas is clearly demon\xc2\xad\nstrated, particularly in resolution and detail of bathymetry and coastal\n\nturbidity.\n\nOne notices on the cblor film (but not on the color infrared\n\n\nfilm) that the low sun angle of Pass 85 aids in differentiating between\n\nthe signatures of turbid water and bathymetric features.\n\nThis is be\xc2\xad\n\ncause the low sun angle limits water penetrability but has little or\n\nno apparent effect on the rendition of turbid water.\n\nAn unusual turbidity phenomenon near the east end of the south\n\ncoast is best shown on the color film.\n\nJust off the prominent point\n\n\n(unnamed on Chart 920, in pocket) southeast of the town of Jobos a\n\n\n-\n\n22\n\n\xc2\xad\n\na sediment plume extends at least 5 nautical miles (9 kilometers)\n\ndirectly seaxvard.\n\nOnly 16 nautical miles (27 kilometers) along Lhe\n\n\ncoast to the east, in the vicinity of Punta Tuna, turbidity patterns\n\nclearly reveal that coastal currents are strong and are moving south\xc2\xad\nwestward parallel to the shore.\n\nThe fact that the sediment plume off\n\n\nthe unnamed point goes directly seawaid proves that the Longshore\n\ncurrent changes direction off the unnamed point and turns seaward.\n\nHere we have a direct application of the utility of orbital high\xc2\xad\nresolution photography for the detection of an anomalous situation in\n\nthe pattern of coastal currents.\n\nOne wishes so that rapidly time\xc2\xad\n\nrepetitive photography of this quality were available, for detecting\n\nthe presence of such an anomalous situation would be truly impossible\n\nwith conventional ship-bourne or even aerial photography unless from\n\ngreat altitude with wide-angle lenses.\n\nEven once detected, measuring\n\n\nthe extent and the time history of one single such current anomaly\n\nwould be a formidable and extremely expensive job for a well-equipped\n\nresearch vessel.\n\nPrevious comments to the effect that 0.5-0.6 micrometer imagery\n\nshows everything the color imagery shows, but not so well, remain\n\nmostly true for the Pass 85 images.\n\nRendition of the presence and\n\n\ndetails of water turbidity are very nearly as good on the 0.5-0.6\n\nmicrometer images as on the color, however.\n\nThe only factor that is\n\n\nknown to have changed from Pass 5$ is sun angle, and we may tentatively\n\nsuggest that low sun angle has acted somewhat to improve the rendition\n\nof turbidity in the 0.5-0.6 micrometer band,\n\n\n- 23 \xc2\xad\n\nOn the 0,6-0.7 micrometer-images, the low gun angle of Pass 85\nhas reduced water penetration in a clear-water area to only about\n10 feet (3 meters) for the highest-contrast target available, the\nsubmarine point at the northwestern corner of the Isla de Vieques.\n\n-\n\nDepth penetration for less splendid bathybmetric targets is considerably less.\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nAs on the other passes, this makes the 0.6-0-7 micrometer\n\nimagery valuable for differentiating turbidity from ba-thymetry, though\nturbidity features are poorly rendered compared with color or 0.5-0.6\n\nmicrometer imagery.\n\n\nThe 0A7-0.2 micrometer Pass 85 images portray only the coastlines,\n\nthere being no oil-slicks in the area.\n\nNear the south coast of St.\n\n\nCroix between Long Point and Southwest Cape the color and other short\xc2\xad\nwavelength images show very well the outline and fairly well some\n\ninternal detail of a light-colored patch that corresponded only moder\xc2\xad\nately well with the fairly good but old bathymetric data available for\n\nthe area.\n\nUntil consulting the 0.l,0.a micrometer imagery it was an\n\n\nopen question whether the light-colored area respresented bathymetry\n\nor an oil slick, but its absence on the 0.7-0.8 micrometer imagery\n\nclinches its identification as a bathymetric feature.\n\nThus Skylab\n\n\nimagery is in this case yielding information on changes in bathymetry\n\nduring the many years since the bathymetric survey was made.\n\n\nThe 0.8-0.9 micrometer imagery shows nothing but shoreline\n\nshape detail, though it does that well.\n\nIn that band as well as\n\n\nin the 0.7-0.8 micrometer band, dense cloud shadows obscure the\n\n\n- 24 \xc2\xad\n\ncoastline as effectively as do the clouds themselves.\n\n\nEarth Terrain Camera (SI90B)\n\nPass 6, 9 June 1973.-- A mosaic of western Puerto Rico from\n\nframes 239 and 240 of the SI90B Earth Terrain Camera is reproduce.\n\nin figure 5, and the Pass 6 coverage diagram is shown in figure 6.\n\nThe 8190B color image is of course similar to the S90A color\n\nimage, but the resolution is considerable improved.\n\nMuch more detail\n\n\nis revealed in the supremely complex patterns in the Bahia de Mayaguez\n\nin the vicinity of the great blue anomaly.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, color cannot be used to differentiate\n\nturbid water, which from low-altitude aircraft observation is somewhat\n\nbrownish-gray, and bathymetric features, which from low-altitude air\xc2\xad\ncraft appear as shades of blue lightening toward white.\n\nThe great blue anomaly is in general about 16 nautical miles\n\n(30 kilometers) long and 7 nautical miles (13 kilometers)wide, Aerial\n\nobservations and photography on the same day from altitudes up to\n\n12,000 feet of course showed many details of the complex overall\n\nsituation in the area, but the perspective from that altitude was\n\ninsufficient to get the overall picture in mind, or to photograph it.\n\nEven the RB57F photography (flown many months later) from 62,000 feet\n\n(18,900 meters) would not have had a wide enough swath-width to portray\n\nthe overall situation.\n\nThus orbital-height high-resolution photography\n\n\nhas here again proved its unique synoptic ability.\n\nThe

Desecheo (small dark area at top).\n\nThe "great blue anomaly" effluent area is very well portrayed. The\n\novate light-colored area protruding into it from the north is the\n\nturbid-water plume of the Rio Grande de Afiasco. South of the great\n\nblue anomaly is a complex interplay of turbid water and bathymetric\n\nfeatures, and in that area long narrow dark slicks thought to be of\n\nnatural origin can be seen. The edge of the insular shelf is well\n\nportrayed offshore southwestward from Puerto Rico; maximum water\n\npenetration is about 72 feet (22 meters). The faint pattern in the\n\nopen ocean north and south of Puerto Rico is thought to be caused\n\nby Langmuir cells. Note that they indicate different wind directions\n\non the two sides of the island. The wake that extends downwind (south\xc2\xad\nwestward) from the Isla Desecheo is clearly visible at the top of the\n\nimage.\n\n\n..................\n\ne\n\n\n67030\'\n\n670\n\n\\\\\n\n660\n\n650\n\n64,\n;\n\n0\n\nN\n\n.\n\nDESECHEO\n\n;.\n\n~\n\nISSLAa\n\nJuan\n~San\n\nISLA OE\n\nISLA\n\nayagu~z\nR\n\nP\n,\n\nP\n\nA,\n\n\'-...\n\n0\n\nBRiTiSH\n\nISLA DE\n\nAMERICAN\n\n,Pone\n\n2\n\nC\n\nCULEBRA\n\nAE\n\nR IC 0\nRIC\n\nTO\n\n,\'_\n\nIS-LANDS\n\nMUERTOS\n\n\\\\\n\nSX70\n\n\\ \'V\n\n0\n\nFIGURE 6.

detected even by a scouting plane\n\n\nthat was sent over the area at 2500 feet (762 meters) on the morning\n\nof Pass 54 specifically to\'search for such phenomena so they could be\n\nquafitified by a\n\nresearch vessel,\n\n\nUnfortunately the scout plane located and directed the ship to\n\nwork on a smaller turbidity feature off Punta,Maldonado, slightly east\n\nof San Juan, that by simple bad luck was one of the few totally cloud\xc2\xad\nobscured areas on the north coast at the exact time of the Skylab pass.\n\nIn this example, as so often, the urgent need and scientific value of\n\nrapidly time-repetitive coverage of Skylab S190B quality is evident.\n\nThe rarity and value of high-resolution orbital imagery is also\n\nemphasized by the overall situation on the north coast of Puerto Rico\n\non the day of Pass 54.\n\nSo little rain had fallen in previous days\n\n\nthat the entire north coast west of a point slightly west of San Juan\n\nshows no sediment discharge from rivers, except for a very small\n\nplume from the Rio Grande de Arecibo.\n\n(It does, however, show a\n\n\nwestward-swept plume of spent molasses from a group of rum distill\xc2\xad\neries on the western side of the city of Arecibo.\n\nThe area of spent\n\n\nmolasses is about 0.4 nautical miles (740 meters) long and 0.1 nau\xc2\xad\ntical miles (185 meters) wide.)\n\nThe absolute lack of the usual coast\xc2\xad\n\nal belt of turbid water on this long stretch of coast allows identifi\xc2\xad\ncation of many shoal areas that are very probably sand because of\n\ntheir light color, and that represent potential resources of what in\n\nPuerto Rico is a scarce and Valuable commodity.\n\nNeither detailed\n\n\nnearshore bathymetric mapping nor bottom-sampling has been done through\n\n-29\xc2\xad\n\nmost of\'this distance, and the Skylab images contain much new infor\xc2\xad\nmation, though such a narrow coastal belt can also be covered by\n\nhigh-altitude aircraft photography.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that had there been rainfall prior\n\nto Pass 54, the rivers and streams of the north coast would have been\n\ndischarging turbid water, the trends of which could have been used to\n\nmap nearshore water circulation patterns.\n\nThis\n\nis also a-subject of\n\n\nconsiderable practical and economic value, for measuring the current\n\nregime in the vicinity of proposed coastal sewer discharges is a neces\xc2\xad\nsary task but a complex and expensive one when done by conventional\n\nmethods.\n\n\nOn the south coast of Puerto Rico the SI90B phocography shows\n\nboth a narrow belt of turbid coastal water and considerable bathymetric\n\ndetail.\n\nMost of the suspended sediment causing the coastal turbidity\n\n\nis coming from normal coastal erosion rather than from discrete river\n\nsources, however, and it is accordingly difficult to determine the di\xc2\xad\nrection of coastal currents.\n\nThe situation does allow the identifica\xc2\xad\n\ntion of coastal sectors that are undergoing erosion by the sea, however.\n\nIn the broad shallow area between the Isla de Vieques and Puerto\n\nRico, a highly detailed panorama of bottom features appears on the\n\nS190B imagery.\n\nIt corresponds in every major detail with an accurate\n\n\nbathymetric chart (contour interval, 2 meters) of the area, and in\n\naddition it shows patterns not present on the bathymetric chart that\n\ncan only be interpreted as ecological patterns of botton.--dwelling\n\nplant and animal communities.\n\nThe detail in the photography is sc\n\n\n-30\xc2\xad\n\ngood in this area that a special study employing density-slicing and\n\nline microdensitometry on the images and field checking of bottom\xc2\xad\ndwelling communities simply

9).\n\nThe resolution of the Sl90B photography is so superior to that of\n\nthe S190A photography that along the north coast of Puerto Rico con\xc2\xad\nsiderable bathymetric detail undetected on the Si90A photography can\n\nbe seen both inside and outside the coastal belt of turbid water, des\xc2\xad\npite the low sun angle.\n\nIn two north coastal areas not obscured by clouds or cloud sha\xc2\xad\ndows, the shape of the coastal zone of turbid water shows that at\n\nleast the surface currents are west-bound.\n\nThis is the expected di\xc2\xad\n\nrection, but the situation demonstrates the potential of the method\n\nfor detecting nearshore reversals of current direction such as are\n\nsometimes observed near San Juan and probably occur undetected in\n\nother areas.\n\nOn the east and south coasts nearly all bathymetric detail is\n\nmasked by turbid water except for very shoal areas and near islands\n\nfar enough offshore to be in at least somewhat clear water.\n\nAs on the\n\n\nnorth coast, the boundaries of turbid water masses, especially off\n\npromontories of the land, show the direction of coastal near-surface\n\ncurrents to have been uniformly westward when the image was made.\n-31-.\n\n\nAn\n\n\nFigure 9 (following page).-- Sl90B Earth Terrain Camera image from\n\nframe 213, Pass 85.\n\nNorth is tb the upper left in this image of the

It shows only the effluent area called the great blue anomaly.\n\nThe anomaly is broken and dispersed on its south side. That the anomaly\n\nis imaged so strongly at this wavelength is evidence that it is some\n\nkind of man-caused effluent.\n\nThe lower image is the 10.20-12.5 micrometer thermal infrared\n\nchannel. It shows no detail in these nearly isothermal waters. On\n\nland it shows by lighter image intensity that the desert-like coastal\n\narea of southwestern Puerto Rico is hotter than the vegetation-covered\n\nremainder of the island.

imagery.\nscattered places, but\n\nreduce its utility but slightly.\n\n\nThe 0.52-0.56 micrometer image, as would be expected for that\n\nwavelength band, also has excellent water penetration, though slight\xc2\xad\nly less than the S190B color Photography and the preceding 0.46 to\n\n0.51 micrometer S192 image.\n\nRendition ofbithymetry of the quality\n\n\nof these S192 images would be useful in a bathymetrically unmapped\n\nor poorly mapped clear-water area if photography of SI90A or Sl9OB\n\nquality were not available.\n\nOverall the 0.52-0.56 micrometer image is excellent but of\n\ncourse it is severely lacking in resolution compared to either S190A\n\nor Sl90B photography.\n\nAirport runway patterns are well resolved.\n\n\nThe great blue anomaly in the Bahia de Mayaguez is well portrayed,\n\nas are sediment plumes, though some herringbone pattern degrades\n\nthe image of the large plume from the Rio Grande de AEiasco on the\n\nnorth side of the blue anomaly.\n\nThe S192 instantaneous field of\n\n\nview of 260 feet (79 meters) is probably roughly the same as or\n\nsomewhat greater than the width of the long narrow slicks south of\n\nthe blue anomaly, and their pattern was almost but not quite.resolved.\n\nThe wake downwind of the Isla Desecheo appears, but it does not on\n\nthe next band.\n\n\nThe 0.56 to 0.61 micrometer image has less water penetration\n\nbut for an unknown reason has slightly higher resolution than the\n\n\n-33\xc2\xad\n\npreceding band.\n\nIslands and their surrounding shoals made of high\xc2\xad\n\nreflectance coral sand are particularly wicll displayed, and the con\xc2\xad\ntrast within the image, as with the preceding band, is usefully high.\n\n\nThe 0.62 to 0.67 micrometer image shows almost no water penetra\xc2\xad\ntion and thus is useful in conjunction with the preceding bands, es\xc2\xad\npecially that of 0.52 to 0.56 micrometers, in discriminating bathy\xc2\xad\nmetric from turbidity features.\n\nThe linear light-colored zone\n\n\noriented 1000 that was discussed on page 13 is present, p-trQzing.fur\xc2\xad\nther that it is not of bathymetric origin.\n\n\nThe 0.68 to 0.76 micrometer image of course has almost no water\n\npenetration, and the images of turbid water are less well differen\xc2\xad\ntiated from clear-water areas than in the shorter-wavelength images\n\npreviously discussed.\n\nThe great blue anomaly is still strongly por\xc2\xad\n\ntrayed, lending further evidence to the diagnosis that it is neither\n\na bathymetric nor a turbidity phenomenon.\n\nThe 0.78 to 0.88 micrometer image, which is in the nearest infra\xc2\xad\nred, shows no other features in water-covered areas than the great\n\nblue anomaly.\n\nThe ability of such longer wavelength as this and the\n\n\n0.68 to 0.76 micrometer deep red band absolutely to differentiate oil\n\nand perhaps other chemical substances from all other phenomena in\n\nwater-covered areas performs a useful service in the very confused\n\narea south of the great blue anomaly.\n\nThat area has a complex inter\xc2\xad\n\nplay of bathymetric, turbid water, and slick features, but they can\n\nbe sequentially separated one from another by careful comparison\n\nfirst of the 0.52 to 0.56 image, which shows bathymetry\n\n\'-34\xc2\xad\n\nturbidity,\n\n\nand sliccs,\n\nthan second of the 0.62 to 0.67 micrometer image, which\n\n\nshows turbidty and slicks but not bathymetry, and finally of the\n\ninfrared 0.78 to 0.88 micrometer image, which shows slicks but nei\xc2\xad\nther bah,- inetry nor turbidity.\nThus the capability of the S192 multispectral scanner to pre\xc2\xad\nsent images from very discrete narrow spectral bands, a capability\n\nthat is beyond that of present-day pbcezographic techniques, has a\n\nvery direct practical application to image discrimL=Laion even when\n\nviewed only by conventional non-instrumental techniques of photo\xc2\xad\ninterpretation.\n\nThis emphasizes the high potential of computerized\n\n\nband-ratioing techniques when applied to multispectral scapner nu\xc2\xad\nmerical data, a field which this investigator cheerfully leaves to\n\nothers but is very glad to have them working on.\n\n\nThe 10.2\n\nto 12.5 micrometer thermal imagery shows absolutely\n\n\nno detail in water-covered areas.\n\nThis is only to be expected, for\n\n\nthe temperature range in coastal waters in this tropical climate is\n\nvery small.\n\nMaximum temperature range measured on any cruise in\n\n\nPuerto Rican waters during our water study program has been only 20\n\nCelsius.\n\nIn the land area of Puerto Rico the thermal imagery shows an\n\ninteresting effect.\n\nIn southwestern coastal Puerto Rico rainfall\n\n\nis very low, the vegetation is desert-like, and much of the surface\n\nof the ground is exposed.\n\nIn that atea the thermal imagery indi\xc2\xad\n\ncates an appreciably hotter land surface than in the land area in\n\n-the remainder of the image, which is nearly all covered by flourish\xc2\xad\n-35\xc2\xad\n\ning vegetation.\n\nThe outline of the city of Mayaguez shows in consi\xc2\xad\n\nderable detail on the thermal image, and of course is warmer than\n\nthe surrounding vegetated areas.\n\n\nPass 54, 30 November 1973.-- The image of the violet-light\n\nspectral band, 0.41-0.46 micrometers, is smeared, banded, and unusable.\n\nThe image from the next spe~ctral band, 0.46 -\n\n0,51 micrometers,\n\n\nis of perfect technical quality on an early s.euing test strip that\nwas supplied.\n\nThat image shows considerable bathymetrfic d&tail on\n\nthe south coast but does not show the large plume off San Juan.\n\nAn\n\nimage from the same band that was prepared later, however, has I\n\n."PV A\n\n\'C&S_?patterns (associated with high local contrast areas of\n\nwhite cloud and dark land and ocean) and banding, but despite these\n\nimperfections it portrays very well the unusually large offshore\xc2\xad\noriented turbidity plume in the San Juan area that was previously\n\ndescribed in the Pass 54 S190B discussion.\n\nThis image shows the\n\n\nplume to extend 15 nautical miles (28 kilometers) from the coast, and\n\nhas enough detail to show that the plume is wind-driven westward.\n\nOtherwise, the signatures of bathymetry and turbidity are undiffer\xc2\xad\nentiable.\n\n\nThe 0.52\nless clearly.\n\n-\n\n0.56 image also shows the plume off San Juan, but\n\nBathymetry and turbidity are still generally undiffer\xc2\xad\n\nentiable in coastal zones, and even shoreline rendition on the south\ncoast in cloud-free areas is poor.\n\nThe image is of little utility.\n\nAt 0.56 \'- 0.61 micrometer wavelength the image of the large\n\n\n-36\xc2\xad\n\nplume off San Juan is not observed.\n\nIn most places the coastline is\n\n\nindistinguishable from bathymetry and turbidity.\n\n\nAt 0.62 - 0.7 micrometer wavelengths in the light re&F\n\nno fea\xc2\xad\n\ntures are visible in water-covered areas, but the coastline Itself is\n\nfairly sharply resolved,\n\n\nAt 0.68 - 0.76 micrometers, the deep red, shoreline detail is\n\ncrisp on the north coast~but due apparently to some ITst rumental or\n\nprocessing error, the south coast land-to-water contrast is low and\n\nthe coastline is not clearly distinguishable.\n\n\nOn the 0,78 - 0.88 micrometer image, an early screening film\n\nis technically perfect and shows the entire shoreline in perfect de\xc2\xad\ntail.\n\nAs an indication of detail resolution, an island 600 by 900\n\n\nfeet (138 by 274 meters) is well shown, but smaller islands in general\n\nare not.\n\n\nAn image at wavelengths 1.55 - 1.75 micrometers also shows\n\nthe coastline clearly, but with considerably less resolution, probably\n\nbecause of atmospheric absorption.\n\nThe 600 by 900 foot (183 by 274\n\n\nmeter) island readily visible at 0.78 - 0.88 micrometers is not visible\n\nat 1.55 - 1.75 micrometers,\n\n\nThe thermal infrared band (10.2 to 12.5 micrometers) is strong\xc2\xad\nly banded and shows no detail in water\'covered areas, as is to be ex\xc2\xad\npected in this nearly isothermal area.\n\nOn land, metropolitan San Juan\n\n\nshows as significantly higher in temperature than the remainder of the\n\neastern two-thirds of the island covered by the image.\n-37\xc2\xad\n\nThe\n\nhigh\n\n\nmountains in the center of the island and the Sierra de Luquillo near\n\nthe northeastern corner show as distinctly cooler than low-lying\n\ncoastal areas.\n\n\nPass 85, 19 January 1975.-- Pass 85 is the one in which clouds,\n\ncloud fragments, and cloud shadows, elongated by a low sun angle, ob\xc2\xad\nscure much of the coastline, and the one in which turbid water is\n\nprevalent along the coasts.\n\n\nBut the 0.56 - 0.61 micrometer multispectral scanner imagery\n\nshows the coastal turbidity only poorly on the north coast, and not\n\nat all on the south coast of Puerto Rico.\n\nThe image is of good\n\n\ntechnical quality, the curved scan lines being undetectable over\n\nmost of the image, but the cloud and cloud-shadow problem renders it\n\nnearly useless.\n\n\nThe 0.68 - 0.76 micrometer image, being in the deep red, shows\n\nno detail in water-covered areas, proving the absence of oil slicks\n\nin the area that day.\n\nLand topography, incidentally, is shown in\n\n\nsplendid detail because of the very low 180 sun angle.\n\n\nSimilarly the 0.98 - 1.08, 1.09 - 1.19, 1.2 - 1.3, 1.55 - 1.75,\n\n\nand 2.1 - 2.35 micrometer images show no detail in water-covered\n\nareas, as is to be expected at these infrared frequencies.\n\nThrough\n\n\nthis series of frequencies the contrast between the density of land\n\nand sea images decreases progressively, and accordingly, the reso\xc2\xad\nlution of shoreline shape details decreases.\n\n\n-38\xc2\xad\n\nThe thermal infrared (10.2 - 12.5 micrometers) imagery from\n\nPass 85 shows high contrast between cool clouds and warm land and\n\nwater, but the contrast between land and water is so slight that the\n\noutline of the coast can be detected only with difficulty-and in\n\nsome places not at all.\n\n\n-39\xc2\xad\n\nEVALUATION OF OTHER DATA\n\nHigh-altitude aircraft (RB57F)\n\nThe restricted swath-width of the RB57F photography, even\n\nthough the flight height was 62,000 feet (18,900 meters), results in\n\na loss of the valuable overall synoptic coverage that the satellite\n\nimagery affords.\n\nThe RB57F photography is \'of absolutely magnificent\n\n\ntechnical quality, however, and has a remarkably high information con\xc2\xad\ntent for marine and coastline studies, as well as for such other\n\nareas of study as coastal land-use and vegetation studies.\n\nScientists\n\n\nfrom a variety of disciplines have already made extensive use of the\n\nRB57F photography discussed here.\n\nRC-8 color imagery.-- An example of the RC-8 photography (a\n\nportion of a square frame) is shown in figure 14 (following page) in\n\ncomparison with a portion of a frame taken at the same time from the\n\nZeiss aerial mapping camera that used infrared color film.\n\nThe focal\n\n\nlength of the infrared camera was twice that of the color camera,\n\nhence the 2:1 scale difference in the photographs.\n\nEach Re-8 color frame covers a square that is 15.4 nautical\n\nmiles (28.5 kilometers) on a side.\n\nSuch excellent photography of all\n\n\nthe coastlines of Puerto Rico and nearly all those of the Virgin\n\nIslands provides an absolute cornucopia of information and detail,\n\nespecially since it was exposed with 60% forward frame overlap so\n\nthat all of it can be examined stereoscopically.\n\nFor instance, figure 11, shows frQm the shape of the plentiful\n\nturbid water plumes that the coastal water currents that day were\n\n\n-40\xc2\xad\n\nFigure 14 (following page).-- RB57F RC-8 color and Zeiss color infrared\n\nphotographs of the coastal area off metropolitan San Juan.\n\n\nNorth is to the left, or offshore, in both photographs. They\n\nwere taken nearly simultaneously from a flight height of 62,000feet\n\n(18,960 meters). Focal length for the top image was 6 inches and\n\nfor the bottom image was 12 inches, hence the 2:1 scale difference.\n\nDirections of coastal currents deduced from the upper image are\n\nshown in figure 18 (following page 53), which also contains informa\xc2\xad\ntion on amount of suspended sediment, water transparency, and water\n\ncolor that resulted from the work of a research vessel that was in\n\nthe area at the time.\n\n\nSM\n\nPh.\n\nWh\n\nR\nFN\nM\n\n--- -------- ... .....\n-......\n....\n\n.......... \n\n..\n\n\nflowing eastward off San Juan, an anomalous but not unusual occurrence.\n\nWhen seen in its entirety, that frame shows that the eastbound coastal\n\ncurrent extended 1 to 2 nautical miles (1.8 to 3.7 kilometers) off\xc2\xad\nshore, and allows actual mapping of its outer edge.\n\nThe eastbound\n\n\ncoastal current is bordered seaward by a generally continuous zone of\n\nslack water ranging in width from 1 to 2 nautical miles (1.8 to 3.7\n\nkilometers), and that zone is in turn-bordered seaward by the normal\n\nwestward-flowing oceanic current that prevails around Puerto Rico.\n\nThe illustrated frame and others of the north coast show clearly,\n\nmoreover, that the eastbound near-shore current is not continuous, but\n\ninstead is broken up into cells because it turns seaward at coastline\n\nor bathymetric prominences.\n\nThis cell activity causes and explains\n\n\nthe occurrence of the northwestward-oriented plumes sometimes detected\n\nvisually from shore and from research vessels in the San Juan area.\n\nThe northwestward-oriented plumes are the vector resultant of the off\xc2\xad\nshore-bound eastern end of the nearshore eastward-flowing currdnt cell,\n\nand the offshore west-bound oceanic currents.\n\nThe water in and adjacent to this northwestward-flowing plume\n\nas well as other turbidity features in the San Juan area were mea\xc2\xad\nsured and sampled from a research vessel at the time of the RB57F\n\nflight.\n\nThe results of that work are described in the succeeding section\n\n\non ground truth.\n\nThey quantify the aircraft imagery tightly and well.\n\n\nThe northwestward-oriented plume that was measured and sampled\n\nis prominent on figure 14, and is located off Punta Maldonado, oppo\xc2\xad\n\n-41\xc2\xad\n\nsite the runway pattern of San Juan Inteznational Airports\nnautical miles\n\nIt is 4.5\n\n\n(8.3 kilometers) long.\n\n\nDoes the much larger and longer (15 nautical miles, 30 kilo\xc2\xad\nmeters) offshore plume off the San Juan harbor mouth detected by sa\xc2\xad\ntellite imagery and discussed on pages 28-29 have the same origin\n\nas that just established for the smaller one off Punta Naldonado?\n\nOnly orbital photography with its tremendously wide field of view\n\ncan give the answer, and then only if it happens to be taken on a\n\nday when 1) the phenomenon is present, and 2) when extremely numerous\n\nand dense coastal turbidity features are present, as they were when\n\nthe RB57F photography was flown.\n\nThe second condition did not obtain\n\n\nwhen Skylab Pass 54 was made, so the question remains unanswered.\n\nReturning to the image shown in figure 14, sources of turbid\n\nwater, especially along the shoreline of metropolitan San Juan, are\n\nreadily pinpointed.\n\nTheir path through the linear but interrupted\n\n\noffshore reef is also evident.\n\nWhat is not evident on figure 14,\n\n\nbut is beautifully evident upon stereoscopic examination of that\n\nframe and the adjacent ones, is that in places\n\n(for example near the\n\n\nmiddle of the frame image in figure 14) the turbid water actually\n\nflows downward beneath clear surface water just outside the reef\n\nline.\n\nThe turbid water, being fresh water from very recent rain\xc2\xad\n\nfall and thus originally lower in density than salt water, would\n\nhave floated upon the surface of the salt water-had not the heavy\n\nload of suspended sediment increased its density above that of sea\xc2\xad\nwater and caused it to flow down the inclined sea floor.\n\nThe preceding discussion illustrates some pertinent points\n\n\n-42\xc2\xad\n\nabout the r lative utility of orbital and aircraft imagery, and about\n\nthe luck of timing and the desirability of time-repetitive earth re\xc2\xad\nsources sensing.\n\nNote that one frame (admittedly one of the more in\xc2\xad\n\nteresting ones) of RB57F photography, with its adjacent frames used\n\nstereoscopically, yielded a really significant number of valuable\n\nobservations.\n\nBut this does not simply mean that high-altitude air\xc2\xad\n\ncraft photography shows more than its orbital-height equivalent.\n\nIt\n\n\nwas simply by luck that the RB57F photography was flown immediately\n\nfollowing heavy rains which caused the extremely turbid water from\n\nthe patterns of which the information was extracted.\n\nStereoscopic\n\n\neffect was strong enough with the aircraft imagery to detect the\n\ndownward-flowing turbidity plume (a rarely observed phenomenon), and\n\nsatellite photography could not have detected that effect.\n\nOn the other hand, had we been lucky enough to have had satel\xc2\xad\ntelite imagery taken when coastal turbidity was so prevalent, other\n\nlarger features that escaped the relatively narrow field of view of\n\nthe aircraft imagery would likely have been detected.\n\nNote that the\n\n\nvery large offshore-trending plume off the mouth of San Juan Harbor\n\nthat was discovered on the Pass 54 S190B satellite imagery would\n\nhave escaped detection by coastal high-altitude photography, and\n\nwas not seen by a plane at 2,500 feet (762 meters) that was in the\n\narea expressly to find such features.\n\nThus evaluation of the relative utility of satellite and air\xc2\xad\ncraft photography is a bit intricate if both kinds of photography\n\nare not done on the same day.\n\nIn the present study the scheduling\n\n\nand logistics of the high-altitude aircraft for a mission so far\n\n-43\xc2\xad\n\nfrom the continental United States prevented simultaneous high\xc2\xad\naltitude and satellite photography.\n\nThis must not, incidentally, be considered as a derogatory\n\ncomment on the capability of the NASA Earth Observations Aircraft\n\nProgram.\n\nQuite to the contrary, the aircraft support group and\n\n\nflight crew, under the direction of Thomas L. Barrow, Aircraft Pro\xc2\xad\nject Manager, displayed a high degree of expert competence, motiva\xc2\xad\ntion and tenacity in the face of bad cloud conditions, poor communi\xc2\xad\ncations, and instrumental difficulties and thus successfully achieved\n\nthe project goals.\n\nObviously first-class high-altitude aerial photography such\n\nas was made for this project has its range of scientific and practi\xc2\xad\ncal potentialities, just as do orbital photography and imagery.\n\nThese potentialities overlap, though far from completely, in the\n\nfield of coastal studies.\n\nThe overall point that this report estab\xc2\xad\n\nlishes, however, is that earth-resources sensing by satellite pro\xc2\xad\nvides much valuable information that cannot be obtained by any other\n\ntechnique.\n\n\nThe preceding part of this text section discussed but one of\n\nthe many frames of RB57F R-8 color photography that cover all the\n\nPuerto Rican coastline and nearly all that of the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe many other frames contain an absolute plethora of beautifully\xc2\xad\nportrayed details of coastal and shallow-water phenomena.\n\nSome are\n\n\nportrayed in figure 15 (following page), a reproduction of part of\n\nan RC-8 color frame covering the waters between the Isla de Vieques\n\n-44\xc2\xad\n\nFigure 15 (following page).-- RB57F RC-8 color photograph of the waters\n\nbetween the Isla de Vieques and southeastern Puerto Rico.\n\n\nNorth is to the left, toward the binding.

the area shown on figure 15.\n\nIt is not within the purpose\n\n\nof this report to describe and evaluate all the RC-8 color and Zeiss\n\ncolor infrared images, but instead to compare the utility of such high\xc2\xad\naltitude photography with that of Skylab imagery.\n\nOf course the high-altitude aircraft color film shows far more\n\ndetails of bathymetry and turbidity than does the satellite imagery,\n\nsimply as a function of scale.\n\nIn addition the aircraft photography\n\n\nis of particular value in mapping the distribution of benthic plant\n\nand animal communities because of its scale and because such ecologi\xc2\xad\ncal patterns are inherently much finer and subtler in details of color\n\nand outline than are most bathymetric or turbidity features.\n\nIt has been\n\n\nnoted on pages 30 and 31, however, that such ecological patterns are\n\nmappable from the best Skylab photography under favorable circumstances.\n\nConsidering the need of mapping the tremendous extent of clear\xc2\xad\nwater coastal areas off less developed and therefore much more poorly\n\n\nmapped or unmapped areas and nations than Puerto Rico, the ability of\n\nSkylab imagery to portray not only bathymetry and turbidity phenomena\n\n\nbut also to some degree the ecological patterns\'of bottom-dwelling\n\nplant and animal communities shows its true potential.\n\nStaging and\n\n\nflying the RB57F even to Puerto Rico uas a formidable. technical feat.\n\n\nCovering many of the little-known coastlines of the world by high\xc2\xad\naltitude aircraft photography would be staggeringly difficult and ex\xc2\xad\n\n-pensive.\n\nSkylab or a similarly-equipped orbital vehicle, however,\n\n-45\xc2\xad\n\ncould d6 such mapping easily simply by making minor changes in orbital\n\ntrack.\n\nIt i3 in considering this type of world-wide mapping needs\n\n\nthat we approach the true potential of such orbital earth-resources\n\nobservatories as Skylab.\n\nOne has great hopes for the forthcoming\n\n\nearth-orbiter shuttle system in this matter.\n\n\nZeiss color infrared photography.-- This photography is at\n\ntwice the scale of the RC-8 color photography, and hence has bo\'th a\n\nnarrower swath-width and higher resolution of details.\n\nAs with the\n\n\nRC-8 color film, the infrared film can be magnified to 20x before\n\nthe image degrades.\n\nAs was previously established for orbital height photography\n\n(pages 12-1.4), the Zeiss color infrared imagery shows neither bathy\xc2\xad\nmetric nor turbidity features as well as does the RC-8 color imagery,\n\ndespite its larger scale.\n\nEven the prominent white shallow shoal at\n\n\nthe western end of the Isla de Vieques, the finest bathymetric target\n\nin all Puerto Rican waters, shows relatively little contrast on the\n\ncolor infrared film.\n\nMaximum underwater penetration is on the order\n\n\nof 72 feet (22 meters), but the details are not well rendered because\n\nthey are lacking in contrast.\n\nDetection of oil slicks is facilitated if the target area is\n\nat the edge of the sun-glint pattern, though sun-glint of course also\n\nhas the adverse effect of wiping out bathymetric detail.\n\nThe high\xc2\xad\n\naltitude aircraft photography, particularly the infrared color because\n\nit is at the largest scale, allows the detection of oil slicks at the\n\nedge of the sun-glint area in the inner harbor of the Bahia de Ponce\n\n\n-46\xc2\xad\n\non the south coast of Puerto Rico, in the immediate vicinity of tuna\xc2\xad\npacking and other industrial plants.\n\nThe sun-glint pattern also some\xc2\xad\n\ntimes fortuitously allows the complex patterns of wave-front refrac\xc2\xad\ntion around islands and coastal promontories to be studied.\n\nBut again,\n\n\nthese are really virtues of an adversity, which is the loss of bathy\xc2\xad\nmetric and other details in the sun-glint areas.\n\nSkylab photography\n\n\nis carefully designed to avoid sun-glint areas, and thus loses no de\xc2\xad\ntail to sun-glint, but oil-slicks and wave iefraction patterns cannot\n\nbe detected by use of the sun-glint phenomenon.\n\nOne advantage of the large scale of the Zeiss color infrared\n\ntopography is the detection of floating windrows of seaweed offshore\n\nfrom Puerto Rico.\n\nThey can be firmly identified because of their\n\n\npink chlorophyll response, the same as that shown by land vegetation.\n\n\nMultispectral\n\nHasselblad camera system.-- The portrayal of\n\n\nbathymetry is so good in the two lower-frequency spectral bands of\n\nthis photography that one feels regret that the waters around Puerto\n\nRico were so turbid on the days (16 and 17 January 1974) when it was\n\nflown.\n\nHigh-turbidity water features cover a large area following\n\n\nheavy rains, as was the case on those days.\nthe Hasselblads with 80-n\n\nThe acceptance angle of\n\n\nlenses \'gave at this flight-height an image\n\n\nabout 7.5 nautical miles (13.9 kilometers) square, and this is narrow\n\ncompared to the extent of the turbid-water features, but for most\n\nplaces is not too narrow to portray coastal bathymetric features.\n\nThe Hasselblad film, all of which is black-and-white, is grainy\n\nat 7x magnification, and the effect is particularly strong after one\n\n\n-47\xc2\xad\n\nhas been examining the large-format high-resolution color and color\n\ninfrared film also used in the RB57F.\n\nNevertheless fairly fine ba\xc2\xad\n\nthymetric detail is very well portrayed at the lower wavelengths in\n\nclear-water areas.\n\nA set of multispectral Hasselblad images is shown in figure 17\n\n(following page).\n\nThe area shown is a part of the same San Juan area\n\n\nshown in figure 14 (which follows page 40).\n\n\nThe 0.48-0.58 micrometer Hasselblad film has bathymetric detail\n\nto water penetration depths of about 84 feet (26 meters) in areas of\n\nclearest water where detailed bathymetric mapping was available for\n\ncomparison.\n\nThese areas are the shelf southeast of the Isla Caja de\n\n\nMuertos, the shelf west of the western end of the Isla de Vieques,\n\nand the broad shoal area east of St. Croix.\n\nThe shelf-edge in the\n\n\nCabo Rojo area, off the southwestern corner of Puerto Rico, is nor\xc2\xad\nmally in perfectly clear water, but the extremely high turbidity of\n\nPuerto Rican coastal waters along the coast to the east seems\n\nto\n\n\nhave resulted in some occlusion in the Cabo Rojo area, which is down\xc2\xad\ncurrent from the south coast.\n\nMaximum penetration there was about\n\n\n72 feet (22 meters).\n\nOperational resolution of the 0.48-0.58 micrometer film on\n\nland targets was on the order of 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) or\n\nless.\n\n\nThe 0.52-0.58 micrometer Hasselblad film shows details of tur\xc2\xad\nbid waters significantly better than does the 0.48-0.58 micrometer\n\n\n-48\xc2\xad\n\nFigure 17 (following page).-- RB57F Multispectral Hasselblad camera\n\nphotographs of the San Juan harbor mouth area.\n\n\nNorth is toward the top of the page in each image. Color and\n\ncolor infrared photographs of most of the same area are shown in\n\nfigure 14 (following page 40).\n\nThe upper left image was made by light of wavelengths 0.48 to\n\n0.58 micrometers, the upper right image by wavelengths of 0.52 to\n\n0.58 micrometers, the center left image by wavelengths of 0.54 to\n\n0.60 micrometers, the center right image by wavelengths above 0.60\n\nmicrometers, and the lower image by infrared wavelengths of 0.70 to\n\n0.89 micrometers. The infrared image shows only breaking waves in\n\nwater-covered areas, though the faint trace of a smoke plume from a\n\nthermal power plant can be seen at the right side of the bay on the\n\nleft; the wind was from the east.\n\n\nA71\n\n\n-film, probably because of atmospheric absorption at the bluer end of\n\nthe spectral interval, and possibly also because the two films were\n\napparently developed to different gammas:\n\nthe 0.52-0.58 micrometer\n\n\nfilm is less dense and contrasty than the 0.48-0,58 micrometer film.\n\nDetails of land targets are significantly more poorly resolved on the\n\n0.52-0.58 micrometer film than on the 0.48-0.58 micrometer film.\n\nThe\n\n\nshme type film (EK 2402 Plus-X Aerographic) was used in both cameras.\n\nOne suspects a slight laboratory processing error in the case of the\n\n0,52-0.58 micrometer film:\n\nThe 0.52-0.58 micrometer film shows very slightly less depth\n\nof water penetration than does the 0.48-0.58 micrometer film, as\n\nmight be expetted from its spectral coverage.\n\nThus we have the same\n\n\neffect observed on the Skylab multispectral imagery:\n\nthe blue end of\n\n\nthe visible spectrum is superior for water penetration and detail, and\n\nthe green-yellow-orange band is superior for rendition of turbid water.\n\nThis hardly comes as a surprise, since bathymetric detail is blue and\n\nturbid water is greenish-yellow.\n\n\nThe 0.54-0.60 micrometer Hasselblad film is slightly but dis\xc2\xad\ntinctly inferior to the 0.52-0.58 micrometer film in maximum depth of\n\nportrayal of bathymetric features, just as the spectral-band numbers\n\nwould indicate.\nrather better.\n\nSimilarly, the rendition of turbid-water features is\n\nResolution of land targets on the 0.54-0.60 microme\xc2\xad\n\nter film is slightly inferior to the b.48-0.58 micrometer film but\n\nfar superior to that of the 0.52-0.58 micrometer film.\n\nThe Hasselblad camera containing the 0.54-0.60 micrometer\n\n\n-49\xc2\xad\n\nfilm-filter combination failed near the end of the first flight line,\n\nbut note thac this was the only known camera malfunction in a mission\n\nthat used a total of 8 cameras of 3 types for 2 long flying days in\n\nwhich a total of 765 data miles (1417 kilometers) was covered.\n\n\nThe Hasselblad film that recorded the red wavelengths upward\n\nfrom 0.60 micrometers shows numerous turbid-water features, particu\xc2\xad\nlarly off San Juan and along the southeast coast of Puerto Rico where\n\nthose features were most strongly developed.\n\nRed light also portrayed\n\n\nturbidity features in the Skylab S192 multispectral scanner imagery\n\nof Pass 6 (page 34), when turbidity conditions were perhaps about\n\naverage.\n\nWe conclude that red light does record water turbidity, but\n\n\nnot at all well compared with the 5,hoA-Teravelengths in the green\xc2\xad\nyellow.\n\nThe fact that it does record turbidity is of practical utility\n\n\nas a turbidity-bathymetry discrimination tool, for it records bathy\xc2\xad\nmetry only of the lightest-colored and shallowest features.\n\nUsable ground detail resolution for land targets of the red\xc2\xad\nlight Hasselblad image is far superior to that of the longer-wavelength\n\nHasselblad images just discussed.\n\nSidewalks about 6 feet (2 meters)\n\n\nwide in parks in San Juan are very clearly portrayed, and individual\n\nvehicles on highways are discernible.\n\n\nThe infrared (0.7-0.89 micrometer) Hasselblad film shows no\n\nwater penetration whatsoever on even .the shallowest and brightest tar\xc2\xad\ngets.\n\nIt does, however, show a weak image of some of the most intense\xc2\xad\n\nly developed turbid-water plumes, though surprisingly not including\n\nthose off the San Juan area.\n\nAn unexplained phenomenon is the presence\n\n-50\xc2\xad\n\nof a complex pattern in the brackish-water Laguna San Jose near the\n\nsoutheastern side of metropolitan San Juan.\n\nThe cause is most likely\n\n\nfloating vegetation or plankton.\n\nThe resolution of land targets on the infrared Hasselblad film\n\nis inferior to all other such films excepting only that containing\n\nthe 0,52-0.58 micrometer image.\n\n\nLow-altitude aircraft.-- The use of light aircraft at altitudes\n\nbetween about 1500 and 12,000 feet (450 and 3660 meters) to observe\n\nand photograph coastal and coastal-water features does of course pro\xc2\xad\nduce great quantities of useful-information.\n\nThe fine details of such\n\n\nlocally variable phenomena as coastal erosion and sedimentation and\n\nthe distribution of underwater benthic communities can be seen and\n\nunderstood much better at low altitudes than by the use of orbital\n\nphotography.\n\nNote, however, that such fine details can be observed even better\n\nby personal visits to the study area and by instrumental oceanographic\n\ntechniques, but that the time factor per unit area mapped goes up\n\nsteeply the closer the observer is to the study area, just as does the\n\ndegree of detail that can be mapped.\n\nMany months, indeed years, would\n\n\nbe required to visit in person and map the coastal features of Puerto\n\nRico and the Virgin Islands, a light aircraft would require but two\n\ndays to cover them, the RB57F photographed them in 104 minutes, and\n\nSkylab crossed them in 18 seconds.\n\nThe light aircraft does fill a useful role as a general observa\xc2\xad\n\n- 51\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n* tion platfcrm in earth-resources studies, but there are some.particu\xc2\xad\nlar things that it does exceedingly well, and a great many it cannot\n\ndo at all.\n\nThe primary singular advantage of light aircraft in earth re\xc2\xad\nsources work is their immediate availability at most locations for\n\nobservation of transient phenomena or for quick looks at local con\xc2\xad\nditions at any time.\n\nAn example is their use in turbid-water studies\n\n\nas spotters to direct surface research vessels to areas where the\n\nship\'s work will be most production, as was done in this study.\n\nAnother singular advantage of light aircraft is in detection\n\nand detailed studies of oil slicks by the edge-of-the-sun-glint\n\ntechnique (discussed on pages 46 and 47), for the viewing angle of\n\nany target area with respect to the sun glint may be changed as de\xc2\xad\nsired, as of course can altitude for close-up detection of the source\n\nof slicks.\n\nBut for detection and general portrayal of oil slicks,\n\n\norbital-height multispectral imagery is of similar acuity, and fur\xc2\xad\nthermore has that marvelous synoptic ability that all other methods\n\nlack.\n\nIt is this almost magic synoptic ability of orbital imagery\n\nthat is completely lacking when light aircraft are used.\n\nThey simply\n\n\ncannot go high enough to see more than a small area at a time.\n\n\n-\n\n52\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nGround truth.-- The 65-foot (20-meter) research vessel Jean A.,\n\nowned and operated by the Department of Natural Resources of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, made a total of seven cruises to measure\n\nthe properties and take samples of coastal waters near Puerto Rico\n\nin support of this investigation,\n\nCruises and the portions of longer\n\n\ncruises devoted to water measurement\nfrom one to four days.\n\nand sampling ranged in length\n\n\nThis considerable amount of expensive ship\xc2\xad\n\ntime was a valuable contribution by the Puerto Rico Department of\n\nNatural Resources to the success of this investigation, and it resulted\n\nin a considerable saving of scarce NASA funds.\n\nGrateful acknowledgement\n\n\nis made to the Department of Natural Resources not only for the extensive\n\nuse of their research vessel, but also for their splendidly cooperative\n\nattitude.\n\nThe vessel was not available at the time of the Skylab EREP\n\nPass 6 on 9 June 1973.\n\nIt took a very successful series of water stations\n\n\noff San Juan during EREP Pass 54 on 30 November 1973, but by bad luck\n\nthe area in which the work was done was obscured by an isolated cloud\n\npatch at the moment that Skylab imaged the area.\n\nDuring the first day\n\n\nof the RB57F flights, 16 January 1974, the research vessel again made a\n\nhighly successful cruise off Punta Maldonado and the mouth of San Juan\n\nharbor, and the results key beautifully to the detail on the high-altitude\n\naerial photography, as discussed and illustrated later in this section.\n\nBecause of poor commercial communicati~ns facilities at the Puerto Rico\n\nend, it was not known in San Juan until 21 January 1974 that EREP Pass 85\n\nof 18 January 1974 had taken place, but on 22 January the ship put to sea\n\nin an attempt to quantify the imagery to some extent.\n\n- 53\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nCloudiness along\n\n\nFigure 18 (following page).-- Outlines of major turbid waterbodies,\n\ndirection of \'surface currents, amount of suspended

Rico and low sun angle during Pass 85 made the\n\ndata useless for quantifying the Skylab imagery, but of course the data\n\nserve further to describe the properties of Puerto Rican coastal waters.\n\nFour other water cruises not time-related to Skylab passes or RB57F\n\nflights were made on 21-22 October 1973, 3-12 December 1973, 17-19 July\n\n1974, and 4-5 August 1974 in order further to describe the properties of\n\nthe ocean water near Puerto Rico.\n\nMuch of the information that resulted from these water cruises\n\nis not pertinent to this report, nor is a detailed description of the\n\nproperties of Puerto Rican waters.\n\nA brief general description of their\n\n\npertinent-characteristics follows.\n\nThe clear tropical waters fax from land in the Canal de la Mona\n\n(Mona Passage) west of Puerto Rico normally have from 0.02 to 0.04\n\nmilligrams per liter (hereinafter expressed as mg/I) of suspended sediment,\n\nForel color number of I or II (the first two steps on a 20-step blue to\n\nyellow scale), Secchi-disc transparency readings in the high twenties of\n\nmeters (meaning that a standard white disc 20 centimeters in diameter\n\ngoes out of\n\night from a ship\'s deck at that depth), and salinities\n\n\nbetween 35 and 35.9 parts per thousand.\n\nSuch characteristics may be\n\n\nconsidered typical of the clear-water areas used for comparative water\xc2\xad\npenetration estimates in the earlier sections of this report, viz. the\n\nCabo Rojo area, the shelf south of the Isla Caja de Muertos, the shelf\n\nwest of the western end of the Isla de Vieques, and the broad shoal area\n\neast of St. Croix, as well as of the broad oceanic areas away from the\n\ninfluence of the Puerto Rico land mass.\n\n\n-\n\n54\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nCoastal waters in the zone between three and five miles off\n\nthe north coast of Puerto Rico in general have from 0.04 to 0.33 mg/i\n\nof suspended sediment, Forel color numbers from III to V, and Secchi\xc2\xad\ndisc transparency readings from 10 to 25 meters.\n\nThe wide range in these\n\n\nproperties portrays well the wide range of turbidity conditions in Puerto\n\nRican coastal waters.\n\nIncidentally, it is not likely that the figures\n\n\non suspended sediment concentrations for the general Puerto Rico area\n\ninclude any significant component caused by planktonic or other organic\n\nmaterial.\n\nOf the seven water cruises made, only that of 16 January 1974, the\n\nfirst day of the RB57F flights, really serves to quantify imagery made\n\nby either Skylab or the RB57F.\n\nThe turbidity situation off the San Juan\n\n\narea that day has been described in some detail on pages 40 to 42, and\n\nmay be seen in figures 14 (following page 40) and 17 (following page 48).\n\nPertinent results of the ship\'s work that day are shown on figure 18\n\n(following page.3),superimppsed on the pattern of major bodies of water\n\nand with arro\'s added to indicate the direction of surface currents\n\nrevealed in the high-altitude photographs.\n\nThe RB57F aircraft made its\n\n\nimages of the area at 1025 local civil time, and the ship\'s observations\n\nand sampling were done between 0930 and 1400 local civil time.\n\nThe numerical data of figure 18 show that the water leaving San\n\nJuan harbor was extremely turbid, very low in visibility, and rated XIII\n\non the Forel scale, or in other words was a yellow-brown color.\n\nThe\n\n\nmeasurements of suspended sediment, visibility, and color at the station\n\nin clear water outside San Juan harbor contrasted strongly with those of\n\nthe three stations nearer shore within the turbid plumes,\n\n\n- 55 \xc2\xad\n\nOff Punta Maldonado the numerical data of figure 18 show the\n\nsame general pattern seen off San Juan harbor:\n\nnearshore very highly\n\n\nturbid water moved offshore as a plume and by mixing became less turbid.\n\nNote in the numerical data of figure 18 that the norththstward-trending\n\nturbid-water plume off Punta Maldonado is bordered both on its landward\n\nand seaward sides by much less turbid water.\n\nThe remarkably high Forel\n\n\ncolor number of XV for the most turbid water at the station furthest\n\n\'inshore off Punta Maldonado, incidentally, is caused by the high organic\n\ncontent of water that has come from an extensive mangrove swamp.\n\n\nIt is strongly to be empbasized that information on coastal water\n\ncharacteristics and currents such as that shown in figure 18 could be\n\ndetermined also from orbital height photography of S190B -quality under\n\nfavorably cloud and turbidity conditions, except for the numerical data\n\nprovided by the research vessel.\n\nBut such numerical data could well be\n\n\nused to calibrate the density of orbital photographic images, and thus\n\nto extend quantification of the photographic images in at least an\n\napproximate way well beyond the limited area that can be sampled in a\n\nshort time by a research vessel.\n\n\n-\n\n56 \xc2\xad\n\nEVALUATION OF RESULTS\n\nThe overall aim of this report is to determine the extent to\n\nwhich orbital sensing can be used for analysis of shallow-water and\n\ncoastal conditions and phenomena in a clear-water tropica3 area.\n\nThis\n\n\nsection of the report defines as clearly and succinctly as possible what\n\nthe various types of orbital sensing can and cannot do in investigating\n\nthat subject area.\n\nIt also contains information on the optimum use of the\n\n\nimagery from each Skylab sensor (SI90A, S190B, and S192), and suggestions\n\nfor further investigation of the Skylab data using instrumental techniques\n\nof image enhancement and data extraction.\n\n\nBathymetric mapping\n\nThe S190B Earth Terrain Camera with its high-resolution color\n\nfilm is the best of the Skylab sensors for detection of bathymetric\n\ndetail.\n\nIts swath-width is less than that of the S190A\n\nbut its resolu\xc2\xad\n\ntion is much greater, and its water-penetrative capability is slightly\n\nhigher (maximum 72 feet, 22 meters, for S190B; maximum 60-65 feet, 18-20\n\nmeters, for Sl90A).\n\nThe S190A results show that color infrared film is inferior to\n\nhigh-resolution color film in portrayal of bathymetric as well as turbidity\n\nfeatures.\n\nFor direct photo interpretation, S190B film should be observed as\n\na film positive at its original 5-inch size through a microscope rather\n\nthan by use of an enlargement; the enlarging causes a significant loss\n\nof resolution.\n\nPaper prints of course have even poorer resolutions\n\n\n- 57 \xc2\xad\n\nFairly accurate contoured barhymetric charts could be made of\n\nclear-water areas by density-slicing the S190B photographic images, and\n\nfdr control, some microdensitometer profiles could be made to compare\n\nwith actual bathymetric profiles done by a research vessel.\n\nIt is much\n\n\nto be regretted that this study Could not include such work, but as an\n\nindication of its practical utility, the cooperative U. S. Geological\n\nSurvey--Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Marine Geologic Mapping Project plans\n\nto perform just such work when time allows.\n\nAn area of significant new\n\n\ninformation expected as a result is the detection of sedimentologically\n\nsignificant areas where the bathymetry has changed since original surveys\n\nby surface ship were made.\n\nThe applicability of bathymetric contour charts prepared from\n\nSkylab imagery to poorly surveyed or unsurveyed shallow clear-water\n\ncoastal areas of the world is obvious.\n\nExperience in Puerto Rico in this\n\n\nstudy shows, however, that repetitive coverage or at least repetitive\n\nopportunities for coverage would be required, for conditions both of\n\nextremely low cloud cover and extremely low turbidity in coastal waters\n\nwould be necessary.\n\nDifferentiation of the signatures on S190B photography of bathy\xc2\xad\nmetry and of turbidity features is not difficult under good conditions in\n\ncoral-reef and in most areas of hard rock bottom, but it is difficult in\n\nareas of smooth sand or mud bottom.\n\nHere the utility of the SI90A multi\xc2\xad\n\nspectral camera comes into play, for as discussed on pages 17-18 and 24,\n\nthe 0.6-0.7 micrometer S190A photographs show only turbidity features,\n\nwhile the 0.5-0.6 micrometer and the color photographs show both turbidity\n\n\n-\n\n58\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nand bathymetry.\n\nS192 imagery is also useful in differentiating images of\n\n\nbathymetry and turbidity.\n\nThe 0.62-0.72 micrometer band used in comparison\n\n\nwith other spectral bands is particularly useful in this regard (page 34).\n\nLow sun angle also aids in differentiating between the signatumes of turbid\n\nwater and of bathymetry on S190B color film (page 22). but the bargain is\n\na poor one because low sun angle limits water penetration,\n\nOne problem in viewing bathymetric detail on the Skylab photo\xc2\xad\ngraphy, especially that of the Sl90B Earth Terrain Camera, is that patterns\n\nof bottom-dwelling marine biologic communities are easily confused with\n\npatterns of bathymetry.\n\nHighly detailed bathymetric mapping will differen\xc2\xad\n\ntiate the two, of course, but few areas even of Puerto Rican waters are as\n\nyet covered by bathymetric contouring of sufficient detail.\n\nThe RB57F RC-8\n\n\ncolor photography is useful in this differentiation because, viewed stereo\xc2\xad\nscopically, the actual underwater relief of bathymetry can be seen and thus\n\nthe ecological patterns differentiated.\n\nOrbital photography does not pro\xc2\xad\n\nvide enough stereoscopic effect for this differentiation. But note that the\n\norbital photography does give details of patterns that are known to result\n\nfrom either bathymetric or ecologic boundaries, and those patterns could\n\nreadily by put into map form.\n\nA modicum of field-checking would then serve\n\n\nto identify the origin of each pattern.\n\nDetection on the S190B photographs of Langmuir circulation cells\n\nin the near-surface water can be used to determine the direction of sur\xc2\xad\nface winds and local variations in their direction.\non SL-2 Pass 6, but not on SL-4 Passes 54 or 85.\n\nThey were detected\n\n\nIdentification of the\n\n\nfactors causing this difference would be required before using them.\n\n\n- 59 \xc2\xad\n\nCoral-reef distribution.-- The material of and hence the debris\n\nfrom coral reefs is in general very white, and accordingly it images very\n\nwell on orbital photography.\n\nThe superior resolution of the S190B color\n\n\ncamera of course makes it the preferred source of information on the loca\xc2\xad\ntion, distribution, and shape of coral reefs.\n\nThe narrow-band 0.56-0.61\n\n\nmicrometer S192 band in particular displayed unusually high contrast for\n\ncoral-reef and coral-sand targets\n\n(page 34), however, and that band might\n\n\nwell be used as a discrimination tool.\n\nOne of the primary deterrents to coral reefs studies has been the\n\nlack of precise detailed information on their distribution and map-plan\n\nmorphology over broad areas.\n\nUse of Skylab-quality imagery, if it could\n\n\nbe made available over broad areas, as perhaps it can be in the future by\n\nthe use of the shuttle-orbiter system, would upon suitable interpretation\n\nsupply exactly the information needed.\n\n\nSedimentation.-- Skylab photography, especially the color images\n\nfrom the S190B Earth Terrain Camera, proves to be very useful both in\n\ngaining an overall concept of the source, movement, and deposition of\n\nsediments along coast and in shallow waters, and in providing specific\n\ninformation on those subjects in localized areas.\n\nPatterns of coastal turbidity (further discussed in a succeeding\n\nsection) show clearly the source and the direction of transportation of\n\nthe finer-grained sedimentary particles that have slow settling rates and\n\nwhich therefore remain suspended in the surface water for an appreciable\n\nperiod.\n\nTurbidity patterns of imagery from different Skylab passes and\n\n\nfrom the RB57F flights can be compared in order to differentiate sediment\n\n\n- 60 \xc2\xad\n\ncoming from rivers and that coming from coasi-al erosion,\n\nUnder the\n\n\nright circumstances (as on Pass 54, page 30), the exact portions of\n\nthe coast undergoing erosion can be identified.\n\nIn such studies of\n\n\nvariable and transient phenomena the need for more tinve.-repeticive\n\norbital photography of at least S190B quality is strongly apparent.\n\nSedimentary particles of sand size and-larger have high settling\n\nrates and thus are only very rarely lifted appreciably above the sea\n\nfloor during transportation.\n\nThey are not present high in the water, do\n\n\nnot occur in the surface layers of turbid water so prominent in orbital\xc2\xad\nheight photography, and cannot in general be detected during the process\n\nof transportation,\n\nThey most assuredly can be detected where they accumu\xc2\xad\n\nlate, however, if the site of accumulation is within the prevailing water\xc2\xad\npenetration ]mLt, which has a maximum of about 84 feet (26 meters) for\n\nclear water.\n\nSand bodies formed from the accumulation of individual grains\n\nare prominent on the Skylab photography in many places around the\nPuerto Rico.\n\nCeastof\n\n\nThe major ones were already known, as for instance the great\n\n\nnorth-trending shoal off the west end of the Isla de Vieqces and the depo\xc2\xad\nsits in the Cabo Rojo area at the southwestern corner of Puerto Rico.\n\nBut\n\n\na number of additional though generally smaller sand deposits have been\n\nlocated by examination of the Skylab photography, particularly along the\n\nlittle-known north coastal waters of Puerto Rico (pages 29-30).\n\nOne sedimentary property that cannot be determined even from low\n\naltitude, to say nothing of orbital altitude, is the particle-size of\n\n\n- 61 \xc2\xad\n\nsedimentary deposits.\n\nHence some of the areas of accumulation stated in\n\n\nthe preceding paragraph to contain sand may well instead be sand and gravel,\n\nor simply gravel.\n\nBut both sand and gravel are in short supply and are\n\n\nvaluable commodities in Puerto Rico.\n\n\nRelation of bathymetry to geologic structure.-- It was thought\n\nthat geological lineaments, particularly fault lines or trends of bedrock\n\noutcrops, might be expressed in the general trend of the sea-floor topo\xc2\xad\ngraphy or in the growth area patterns of different bottom-dwelling plant\n\nand animal communities, particularly in the broad shallow area between the\n\nIsla de Vieques and southeastern Puerto Rico.\n\nTrends or patterns that could\n\n\nbe so interpreted were not observed, however, though minor ones may be pre\xc2\xad\nsent and so far have escaped detection.\n\nBut if such geologically-caused features had been present, they\n\nwould probably have been detected on the Skylab photography.\n\nThis means\n\n\nthat the concept is still valid for other areas where such phenomena might\n\nbe present in shallow water.\n\n\nWater circulation\n\nPatterns of inshore coastal water circulation are highly time\xc2\xad\nvariant and are laborious~and difficult indeed to measure by conventional\n\nground-borne and shipboard methods, and yet a knowledge of them has a great\n\ndeal of both practical and scientific significance.\n\nPractically, a knowledge\n\n\nof the entire envelope of coastal-current conditions, highly time-variant\n\nas they are, is essential for the proper location of sewer outfallsand for\n\npredicting the probable disposal directions of suspended sediment particles\n\n\n- 62 \xc2\xad\n\nfrom construction projects such as the dredging of new harbors, the dis\xc2\xad\npersal directions of industrial wastes, and the future effects of offshore\n\nsand dredging.\n\nSedimentation of silt and clay particles has already killed\n\n\nor crippled the growth of manj of Puerto Rico\'s coral reefs, various new\n\nharbors have been dredged, expensive surveys are now being made to locate\n\nnumerous\n\nsewer outfalls, and the consequences of offshore sand-removal is\n\n\na currently pertinent question.\n\nScientifically the study of coastal-current\n\n\nconditions is important to an understanding of natural processes of shore\xc2\xad\nline erosion, sediment transport, and sediment deposition; the distribution\n\nof the factors that affect marine biological communities; and in the study\n\nof the dynamics-of water bodies in general.\n\nIn mapping the details of movement of coastal surface waters the\n\ncapabilities of orbital-height photography can make a unique contribution.\n\nThe information shown on figure 18 (following page 53) is an excellent\n\ncase in point, and it is from only one frame of high-altitude aircraft\n\nphotography.\n\nBad orbital photography been made on a day of such fortuitously\n\n\ngood turbid-water and cloud-cover circumstances, much more would have been\n\nrevealed, especially about water-circulation phenomena in areas further\n\noffshore.\n\nSkylab detected the giant turbidity plume off San Juan harbor\n\n\non Pass 54 (pages 28-29), and the offshore- and crosswind-directed plume\n\nwas\n\noff Puerto Rico\'s southeastern coast/detected on Pass 85 (pages 22-23, 31-32).\n\nNeither of those passes was at a time of optimum turbid-water development,\n\nnor indeed was the the RB57F flight that resulted in the information shown\n\nin figure 18 (following page 53).\n\nThe urgent need for more time-repetitive orbital coverage is\n\nstrongly apparent here.\n\nThe satellite Earthsat -1 extended the time range\n\n\n- 63 \xc2\xad\n\nof orbital-altitude imagery of Puerto considerably, but even it did not\n\nmake images of Puerto Rico very frequently, and the resolution of its images\n\nis very poor compared to Skylab photography.\n\nA check of all Earthsat-l\n\n\nPuerto Rican coverage reveals one multispectral\n\nscanner image set dated\n\n\n18 October 1972 that shows a sediment plume over 10 nautical miles (18.5\n\nkilometers) long headed almost directly seaward from the mouth of the Rio\n\nGrande de Arecibo,\ncurrents,\n\na remarkable phenomenon in that area of westward-flowing\n\n\nThat image was made on a perfectly arbitrary date with-respect\n\n\nto the condition of the natural phenomena in Puerto Rican coastal waters,\n\nas of course were all the Skylab images, except for consideration of the\n\ncloud-cover conditions.\n\n\nSediment plumes.-- Plumes of sediment-laden water come not only\n\nfrom point sources such as river and narrow harbor mouths, but also from\n\nareas of coastal erosion, areas disturbed by such operations as dredging,\n\nand (it is thought) from the re-suspension of bottom-sediments by long-wave\xc2\xad\nlength swells from distant storms.\n\nSediment plumes are the phenomenon that\n\n\nenabled the discussion of coastal currents in the immediately preceding\n\npAragraphs, but it must be re-emphasized here how well they portray the\n\ntrend of coastal currents and therefore of coastal erosion and sediment\n\ndeposition.\n\nSediment plumes change continually in intensity of development\n\nbecause of a variety of factors, chief of which are rainfall, the local\n\nwind-driven sea, the arrival of long-peiiod swells, and the coastal works\n\nof man.\n\nThe pattern of plumes (as differentiated from their intensity) is,\n\n\nas we have seen, a result of coastal current circulation patterns\n\n- 64 \xc2\xad\n\nand to\n\n\na much lesser extent local surface winds.\n\nAll of these factors can be\n\n\nelucidated by the study of sediment plumes, but, to repeat for emphasis,\n\nthey are a rapidly time-variant phenomenon, and the full utilization of\n\ntheir information content must await the availability of rapidly time\xc2\xad\nrepetitive orbital photography.\n\n\nThese phenomena, while\n\n\nEffluent discharges and oil slicks\n\nusually smaller in size than turbidity phenomena, are also readily detect\xc2\xad\nable by orbital-height photography and imagery.\n\nAs has been shown (pages\n\n\n18-19, 24, 34-35, 38), their images can readily be differentiated from those\n\nof bathymetry and turbidity because they are more reflective at the longer\n\nwavelengths.\n\nAlso they are more responsive to surface winds than surface\n\n\ncurrents, an additional aid in their identification.\n\nThe importance to man of bil-slick detection does not need\n\nelaboration here.\n\nWhat does deserve elaboration is their detectability\n\n\nfrom orbital altitudes, and therefore, the power of such high-resolution\n\nsatellite photography as Skylab\'s in their potential detection on a world\xc2\xad\nwide repetitive basis,\n\nThe great blue anomaly in the Bahia de Nayaguez, discussed at\n\nconsiderable length in this report (pages 11-12, 25-26, 31-32) and\n\nillustrated in figures 2 (following page 10), 5 (following page 25). and\n\n12 and 13 (following page 32), which is clearly caused by discharge of some\n\neffluent, is so large and diffuse when viewed from low altitude that it\n\nhad never been detected previous to Skylab Pass 6, and was not seen from\n\nan elevation of 12,000 feet (3660 meters) during Pass 6.\n\nIt has inciden\xc2\xad\n\ntally, been seen from a high-altitude commerdial airline plane, some months\n\n- 65\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nafter Pass 6.\n\nSmal\n\nsize appears to be no impediment to the detection of oil\n\n\nslicks from orbital altitude, for slicks less than 100 meters wide and\n\nless than a mile long were well above the detection of SI90A photograpny\n\n(page 15), though in at least that case and probably as a general rule, the\n\nsun azimuth from the photo center rust be near to or greater than 90 degrees.\n\nMuch narrower slicks thought to be of.natural origin have also been detect\xc2\xad\ned on the S190A images (page 12), though as with most other targets they\n\nare better portrayed on the SI90B images (page 26),\n\nThe shape of oil\n\n\nslicks usually indicates the direction of surface winds, but-under windless\n\nconditions their shapes Can reveal patterns of surface currents (page\'26).\n\n\nThough the beaches of\n\n\nDistribution of bottom-sediment types\n\nPuerto Rico are made up of a variety of types of sand (Guillou and Glass,\n\n1957), and the shallow sea floor is also widely varied in sediment type\n\nand particle-size, neither the Skylab nor the RB57F photography is of much\n\nuse in discriminating the types.\n\nOrganically-derived sand and gravel containing many particles of\n\ncoral and commonly known by the name is the predominating type of beach\n\nand near-shore bottom sediment in most Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands coastal\n\narea.\n\nIt is light-colored and therefore photographs and images well on all\n\n\nSkylab and RB57F coverage of suitable wavelengths.\n\nMost other sediment types\n\n\nare darker in color and hence would photograph with less contrast and at\n\nshallower water-penetration depths.\n\nSome of the underwater patterns thought\n\n\nto be boundaries of different types of bottom-dwelling plant and animal\n\ncommunities may indeed be boundaries of sediment types, but the presence\n\n\n-\n\n66 \xc2\xad\n\nand boundaries of sediment types other than highly-reflective coralline\n\nsand and gravel are not generally identifiable.\n\nDistribution of marine biologic communities\n\n-\n\nA variety of photo\xc2\xad\n\ngraphic features known to be boundaries of different types of bottom\xc2\xad\ndwelling plant and animal comunities appears on the Skylab S190B photo\xc2\xad\ngraphy in clear-water areas,\n\nThey are particularly well portrayed in the\n\n\narea between the Isla de Vieques and southeastern Puerto Rico (pages 30-31),\n\nbut unfortunately they did not reproduce at all well in figure 7 (following\n\npage 28).\n\nThey may be seen fairly well in the same area in the RB57F RC-8\n\n\ncolor photograph reproduced as figure 15 (following page 44).\n\nThe difficulties with these ecological patterns, aside from the\n\nfact that particularly clear water conditions are a necessary condition\n\nfor their portrayal, lie\nfeatures, and\n\n1) in differentiating them from bathymetric\n\n\n2) in determining exactly what plant or animal communities\n\n\nthe patterns represent.\n\nDifferentiating ecological boundaries from bathymetric features\n\non first-class orbital photography such as that of the S19g0B can be done\n\nto some extent by an experienced person on the basis simply of the outline\n\nand details of the patterns.\n\nHigh-altitude aerial photography (or low\xc2\xad\n\naltitude, for that matter) flown with 60% forward overlap for stereoscopic\n\nviewing is of great assistance in the differentiation, also.\n\nAt least a\n\n\nfew well-located bathymetric profiles made by a ship would be necessary in\n\nmost areas for full differentiation, however.\n\nOnce the pattern of plant-animal communities is differentiated from\n\nbathymetric patterns, the question becomes exactly what plant-animal\n\ncommunities are being portrayed.\n\nThere is simply no way to determine this\n\n- 67 \xc2\xad\n\nexcept to get a boat and dive on or at least swim over the target areas.\n\nExactly such work was done by Kumph and Randall (1961) off St. John in\n\nthe U. S. Virgin Islands using conventional aerial photography and a\n\ndiving sled towed by a small boat.\n\nThey found, as would surely be the\n\n\ncase with similar work on the Skylab S190B or the RB57F photography,\n\nthat after becoming familiar with the area they acquired the ability to\n\ninterpret the aerial photograph patterns rather well with a limited\n\nnumber of additional check dives.\n\n\nUse of Skylab imagery as benchmark data\n\nShoreline and coastal\n\n\nphenomena are highly time-variant over an exceedingly wide range of rates\n\nof change with time.\n\nCoastal water currents and turbidity conditions\n\n\nchange daily, shoreline shape changes a known maximum rate in Puerto Rico\n\nof 5 feet per year (Kaye, 1959, p. 116) but far less in most areas, and\n\nmodern mapping in many places shows from negligible to considerable change\n\nin bathymetric features since the early years of the present century. In\n\naddition, the works of man create sudden perturbations superimposed on\n\nthe changing natural factors.\n\nThe photographs made during the three Skylab EREP passes over\n\nPuerto Rico may be viewed as three closely-spaced frames of a long motion\xc2\xad\npicture which seen in its years-long entirety would show the coastline\n\nbeing eroded landward at some places and built seaward in others, the\n\ngrowth of mangrove islands off the south coast, numerous changes in the\n\nshape of the shallow sea-floor and coral reefs and in the outlines of\n\nbiologic sea-floor communities, and the effects of the works of man.\n\n\n-\n\n68 \xc2\xad\n\nIn this context the value of the Skylab photography and imagery\n\naS benchmark data recording in detail a tremendous variety of character\xc2\xad\nistics of the natural environment of coastal Puerto Rico as they were in\n\nJune and November 1973 and January 1974 becomes apparent.\n\nComparison of\n\n\nthe Skylab photographs and imagery with data of similar quality taken in\n\nfuture years will be a powerful investigative tool in a wide variety of\n\nfields of study.\n\n\n- 69\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nSUMMARY OF UTILITY OF SKYLAB DATA\n\nThis study has demonstrated the following:\n\n\n1. Skylab earth-resources photography and multispectral imagery made\n\nduring three passes over Puerto Rico contains a wealth of data of both\n\npractical and scientific use in a number of fields of study.\n\nThe broad\xc2\xad\n\narea synoptic propercy of the Skylab information allows detection and\n\nstudy of phenomena impossible by any other existing technique.\n\n\n2. A wealth of bathymetric detail is contained in the Skylab\n\nS190B color photography.\n\nDetails of bathymetry are visible to a\n\n\nmaximum depth of 84 feet (26 meters) in areas of clearest water, but tur\xc2\xad\nbidity of coastal waters near Puerto Rico is commonly so high as to re\xc2\xad\nduce water penetration drastically or eliminate it entirely. Fairly\n\naccurate contoured bathymetric charts could be made by density-slicing\n\nthe clear-water S190B images and using microdensitometer profiles com\xc2\xad\npared with actual echo-sounder profiles for control. A combination of\n\nlow cloud cover, high enough sun angle, and low water turbidity is\n\nnecessary for good portrayal of bathymetry.\n\n\n3. Patterns of bathymetric detail and of turbid-water features are\n\ndifferentiable by use of multispectral data of either photographic\n\nor multispectral scanner origin.\n\nImages from wavelengths in the range\n\n\n0.6-0.7 micrometers show only turbidiey features, while images in the\n\nrange 0.5-0.6 micrometers show both bathymetric and turbidity features.\n\n\n- 70 \xc2\xad\n\n4. The identification, distribution and map-plan morphology of\n\ncoral reefs can be determined from orbital photography of S190B quality,\n\nand coverage of large areas by such photography would be of great value\n\nin coral-reef studies.\n\n\n5. The source, movement, and deposition of sea-floor and beach\n\nsediments and the location of areas of coastal erosion can be studied\n\nvery well by orbital-height photography of S190B quality.\n\n\n6. Potentially economic offshore deposits of sand, sand and gravel,\n\nor gravel (which are not differentiable except upon field examination)\n\nare readily detected on orbital-height photography of SIOB quality,\n\nprovided that water-transparency conditions are favorable.\n\n\n7. Traces of geological faults and geologically significant lines\n\nof rock outcrops on the shallow sea floor were not detected in clear\xc2\xad\nwater areas, simply because they were not there.\n\nThey would be detect\xc2\xad\n\nable in areas where present.\n\n\n8. The discrimination of different types of bottom-sediments in\n\nshallow-water areas is inefficient or impossible by the use of orbital\n\nheight photography.\n\nActual field work is necessary for their differen\xc2\xad\n\ntiation.\n\n\n9. Much detailed information on patterns of coastal water currents\n\nis readily available from orbital-height photography of 8190B quality,\n\nbut conditions of high turbidity in the coastal waters are necessary.\n\n\n-\n\n71\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nCoastal currents are so variable and so rapidl\n\ntime-variant that\n\n\nabundant time-repetitive coverage would be necessary to thdir detailed\n\nstudy.\n\nAnomalous large-scale offshore-oriented plumes of turbid water\n\n\ncan only be detected by orbital-height photography, and their study\n\nwould result in new information on the behavior of water currents in\n\ncoastal areas.\n\n\n10. Effluent discharges and oil slicks, even those of small\n\ndimensions, are readily detectable\n\nby orbital-height photography\n\n\nand are differentiable from other phenomena by comparison with the\n\nlonger wavelength bands of multispectral cameras or scanners,\n\nLarge\n\n\ndiffuse and presumably potentially ecologically damaging effluent\n\ndischarges can be detected and studied well only by orbital-height\n\nphotography.\n\nA limiting requirement for oil-slick detection seems to\n\n\nbe that the slick must not be in the sun-azimuth direction from the\n\nphoto center.\n\n\nl1. Portrayal of the patterns and boundaries of bottom-dwelling\n\nplant and animal communities is excellent for clear waters on orbital\xc2\xad\nheight photography of S190B quality, though those patterns are some\xc2\xad\nwhat difficult and sometimes impossible to separate from bathymetric\n\npatterns.\n\nThis is a tool of great potential value, even though actual\n\n\nidentification of the biologic communities responsible for the patterns\n\nrequires personal observation on the scene.\n\n\n- 72 \xc2\xad\n\n12. The applicability of Skylab-quality earth-sensing data is\n\nlimited to relatively clear-water areas for studying and mapping\n\nbathymetry and patterns of bottom-dwelling biological communities and\n\ndetecting potential offshore sand deposits.\n\nIt is not limited to\n\n\nclear-water areas for studies of nearshore currents, coastal erosion\n\nand sediment transportation, or detection of oil slicks.\n\nExtremely\n\n\nhighly turbid water conditions are desirable for studies of coastal\n\nwater currents.\n\n\n13. The Skylab photography and multispectral scanner imagery are\n\na highly detailed record of coastal conditions in Puerto Rico at a\n\ncertain time, and hence are of great potential value for they can be\n\ncompared with future coverage of the same type to determine the trend\n\nof a variety of slowly time-variant phenomena.\xc2\xad\n\n14. Color infrared film is inferior to high-resolution color film\n\nin water penetration and therefore in the portrayal of bathymetry and\n\npatterns of bottom-dwelling biologic communities.\n\nIt is also inferior\n\n\nto color film in rendition of turbidity features, and would seem to\n\nbe preferable to color film only for studies involving vegetation at\n\nor above the water surface.\n\n\n15. Stereoscopic effect as seen in a standard office-type stereo\xc2\xad\nscope is not strong enough on orbital-height photography to show apparent\n\nrelief of bathymetric features, and therefore stereo-overlap orbital\xc2\xad\nheight photography is not inherently efficient considering the restricted\n\n\n-\n\n73\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nfilm-carrying capacity of most spacecraft.\n\nIt would be more efficient\n\n\nto use the film saved to increase either the area or frequency of cover\xc2\xad\nage.\n\nHigh-altitude photography does allow underwater stereo-relief\n\n\neffect, and this is useful in differentiating patterns of bathymetry\n\nand seafloor biologic communities.\n\n\n16. Although high-altitude aerial photography is a tremendous\n\nsource of detailed information on the restricted area it covers, and\n\ngives stereoscopic relief effect underwater as orbital-height photo\xc2\xad\ngraphy does not, dollar for dollar the use of light aircraft up to\n\naltitudes of 12,000 feet (3660 meters) is considerably more efficient.\n\nThis is particularly so because of their general ubiquity and quick\n\navailability.\n\n\n17. Full interpretation of the wide range of details of shallow\xc2\xad\nwater areas shown on orbital-height photography of SIOB quality would\n\n\nrequire considerable field inspection by research vessels and in-the\xc2\xad\nwater personal observation.\n\nThe use of light aircraft to locate signi\xc2\xad\n\nficant phenomena and direct research vessels to them is highly efficient,\n\nthough because of the wide-area synoptic capability of orbital-height\n\nphotography and imagery, not all phenomena detected from orbital height\n\ncan be seen from low-altitude aircraft.\n\n\n18. More rapidly time-repetitive, orbital-height photography is\n\n\nurgently needed for a wide variety of studies.\nshuttle-orbiter system can supply this.\n\n\n-\n\n71A \xc2\xad\n\nIt is hoped that the\n\n\n19. The applicability and potential vzlue of Skylab-quality data\n\nin studies of bathymetry, patterns of coastal currents, coastal \nerosion\n\nsediment transportation and accumulation, effects of coastal works of\n\nman, and oil-slick detection to the less well-developed coastal areas\n\nof the world is high.\n\nIt is a great potential use of orbital-height\n\n\nearth-sensing data in the service of mankind.\n\n\n- 75 \xc2\xad\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBerryhill, H.
