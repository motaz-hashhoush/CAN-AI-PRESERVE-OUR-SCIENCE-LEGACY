The Simulator Planning Guide aids in establishing expectations for both NASA and non-NASA facility customers. The potential audience for this guide includes both internal and commercial spaceflight hardware/software developers. It is intended to assist their engineering personnel in simulation planning and execution. Material covered includes a roadmap of the simulation process, roles and responsibilities of facility and user, major milestones, facility capabilities, and inputs required by the facility. Samples of deliverables, facility interfaces, and inputs necessary to define scope, cost, and schedule are included as an appendix to the guide.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120000397, "id": "f67b1f208acb4d449471fbc67580c84e", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120000397.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120000397/downloads/20120000397.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120000397/downloads/20120000397.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120000397/downloads/20120000397.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
