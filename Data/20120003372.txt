Currently,\nalternate aviation fuels must satisfy MIL-DTL83133F(2008) (military) or ASTM D 7566Annex(2011) (commercial) standards and are\ntermed \xe2\x80\x9cdrop-in\xe2\x80\x9d fuel replacements. Fuel blends of\nup to 50% alternative fuel blended with petroleum\n(JP-8), which have become a practical alternative,\nare individually certified on the market. In order to\nmake alternate fuels (and blends) a viable option\nfor aviation, the fuel must be able to perform at a\nsimilar or higher level than traditional petroleum\nfuel. They also attempt to curb harmful emissions,\nand therefore a truly effective alternate fuel would\nemit at or under the level of currently used fuel.\nThis paper analyzes data from gaseous and\nparticulate emissions of an aircraft combustor\nsector. The data were evaluated at various inlet\nconditions, including variation in pressure and\ntemperature, fuel-to-air ratios, and percent\ncomposition of alternate fuel. Traditional JP-8+100\ndata were taken as a baseline, and blends of JP8+100 with synthetic-paraffinic-kerosene (SPK)\nfuel (Fischer-Tropsch (FT)) were used for\n\ncomparison. Gaseous and particulate emissions, as\nwell as flame luminosity, were assessed for\ndifferences between FT composition of 0%, 50%,\nand 100%. The data showed that SPK fuel (a FTderived fuel) had slightly lower harmful gaseous\nemissions, and smoke number information\ncorroborated the hypothesis that SPK-FT fuels are\ncleaner burning fuels.\nIntroduction\nIn order for a fuel alternate to be truly effective, it\nmust have a sustainable supply and cause little\nenvironmental harm. Combustor emissions are of\ngreat relevance in alternate fuel considerations for\nboth combustor efficiency as well as environmental\nand human health. The life cycle analysis (LCA) of\nfuel feedstocks carries a great effect on the\nusability of the fuel in aviation and is directly\nrelated to the combustor emissions data. The LCA\nestimates the impact of the greenhouse gas\nemissions for the entire fuel process, from\nproduction to distribution to usage, and can\ndetermine the true efficacy of using alternate fuel\nblends [1]. The testing discussed in this study\nrepresents only the emissions created when the fuel\nis in use. Because alternative fuels from multiple\nfeedstocks are still being explored, fuel-flexible\nengine combustors are the primary targets for these\n1\n\ntests, as they will be used for most of the fueling\nwith alternate fuels in the near future.\nThe emissions trending described in this paper\nproves some expected trends while highlighting\ndifferences for further observation. Data were\ntaken from \xe2\x80\x9cCombustor A,\xe2\x80\x9d a proprietary-geometry\nthree-cup combustor sector representative of\ncurrent engine combustor technology (details\nwithheld due to proprietary concerns). Both the\ngaseous and particulate sampling probes were\nplaced at the nozzle exit plane. The probes were\nspecially built for the cell facility at WrightPatterson Air Force Base. The facility has two\nidentical fueling systems in place: one for the JP8+100 (herein referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cJP-8\xe2\x80\x9d) fueling\npurposes and one for the FT fuel. The fuel is\nblended on line to achieve the desired blend.\nFurther details regarding the facility, errors, post\nprocessing parameters, etc., are available in Shouse\net. al [2]. This paper provides a full analysis of the\ndata set introduced in that paper.\nGenerally, the FT fuel is expected to be a cleaner\nburning fuel than the JP-8 fuel, and the blend falls\nsomewhere in between the two. The blend data\nappear to lean closer to the JP-8 emissions count\nrather than the FT emissions, allowing us to\nconclude that JP-8 is the dominating fuel in the\nblend, which is of potential importance when\ndetermining carbon credits or other emissions\nimplications. This is corroborated by observations\nin performance data sets for these tests.\nCombustor Parameters and Collection of\nData\nData from Combustor A emissions was assessed\nfor the following variables:\n1. Inlet pressure (P) and temperature (T): 75 psia\n(0.52 MPa) and 500 \xef\x82\xb0F (533 K), 125 psia\n(0.86 MPa) and 625 \xef\x82\xb0F (603 K), 175 psia\n(1.21 MPa) and 725 \xef\x82\xb0F (658 K), and 225 psia\n(1.55 MPa) and 790 \xef\x82\xb0F (694 K)\n2. Combustor pressure drops (\xce\x94P): 3%, 4%, and\n5%\n3. Fuel blends: 100% JP-8, 50:50 JP-8:FT, and\n100% FT (\xc2\xb15%) (4) Fuel-to-air ratios (F/A):\n0.010, 0.015, 0.020, and 0.025\n4. Fuel-to-air ratios (F/A): 0.010, 0.015, 0.020,\nand 0.025\n\nData were collected for the following emissions:\nNO (ppm), NO2 (ppm), NOx (ppm), CO (ppm),\nCO2 (%), O2 (%), and THC (ppm). Photodiode\noutput voltage was also taken, and both still and\nhigh-speed photography were used and can be\ncorrelated with this luminosity data.\nData such as smoke number information and\nparticulate emissions are analyzed in part, due to\nan incomplete data set. Data from collaborative\ntesting sites are summarized in relevance to the\npaper to illustrate uniformity of the results.\nGaseous Emissions\nNO emissions: Nitric oxide (NO) emissions (with\nmolecular atomic dimension 0.115 nm), measured\nin ppm, show uniform results for all pressure\nlevels. There is a monotone decrease as the change\nin percentage combustor pressure drop (%\xce\x94P)\nincreases and a monotone increase as F/A\nincreases.\nNO2 emissions: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions,\nmeasured in ppm, (0.221 nm) follow a monotone\nincrease with F/A. There is little change as %\xce\x94P\nincreases. The FT fuel trends show greater NO2\nemissions than the JP-8 fuel. Unlike other\nemissions data, the 50:50 blend trends towards the\nFT fuel data rather than the JP-8 data.\nNOx emissions: NOx emissions (ppm) were taken\nas a combination of nitric oxide (ppm) and nitrogen\ndioxide (ppm) data. Because NO emissions were\ngreater, the nitric oxide trends are dominant in the\nNOx emissions data. Therefore, the emissions\nshow a monotone decrease as percent pressure\ndrop \xce\x94P increases, and a monotone increase with\nF/A ratio (Fig. 1), similar to the NO emissions.\nNOx emissions also increase with absolute\npressure. Emissions from the 100% FT blend do\ntend to be lower than those of the JP-8 fuel, but the\ndifference is too small to be conclusive.\nCO2 emissions: The percent of carbon dioxide\n(CO2) emissions (0.116 nm) did not show a\nsignificant difference between fuels or %\xce\x94P, and\nmaintained a monotone increase with F/A.\nCO emissions: Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions\n(0.113 nm) (ppm) showed significant increases\nwith F/A. In the 75-psia (0.52-MPa) pressure\ncombustor, the only pressure for which the F/A\ndata go up to 0.025, the CO concentration\nincreased nearly an order of magnitude from F/A of\n0.020 to 0.025 (Fig. 2). In the rest of the pressures,\nthe concentration jump from F/A of 0.015 to 0.020\n2\n\nFig.1 NOx (ppm) emissions for combustor\ninlet pressure of 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 5%\n\xce\x94P at varied F/A. The FT fuel emissions\nare marginally smaller than both the JP-8\nand 50:50 blend emissions.\n\nFig.2 CO (ppm) emissions for combustor\ninlet pressure of 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 5%\n\xce\x94P at varied F/A. The large jump from the\nlower F/A values to F/A = 0.025 is clearly\ndemonstrated.\n\nFig.3 CO (ppm) emissions differences versus inlet pressures and F/A values at 3, 4, and 5% \xef\x81\x84P. The\ndifferences the baseline JP-8 fuel emissions subtracted from the emissions of 100% and 50:50 FT fuel\nblends. The pressure and F/A combinations that increase differences are shown by the warmer colors.\nis significantly larger than the 0.010 to 0.015 jump.\nThe FT and 50:50 fuels showed a more pronounced\njump with the increasing F/A ratio than the JP-8.\nCO emissions also showed a drastic decrease as\nabsolute pressure increased.\nFigure 3 shows overall trends in CO emissions\ndifferences between JP-8 fuel and the 50% and\n\n100% FT blends. A greater difference is apparent\nat higher F/A values. The 100% FT fuel emits more\nthan JP-8 at higher F/A, but dips lower at lower\ninlet pressures (P). The 50:50 blend shows similar\ntrends to a lesser degree. CO for 100% and 50:50\nFT is slightly\xe2\x80\x94but consistently\xe2\x80\x94higher compared\nwith JP-8 emissions at P = 75 psia (0.52 MPa)\n3\n\nconditions and higher F/A. The differences in CO\nbecome less significant at higher P and lower F/A.\nO2 emissions: The percent of oxygen (O2)\nemissions (0.116 nm) did not show a significant\ndifference between fuels or %\xce\x94P, and maintained a\nmonotone increase with F/A.\nTHC emissions: The total hydrocarbon emissions\nshow no trends directly related to F/A, fuel type, or\n%\xce\x94P. For the 75 psia (0.52 MPa) pressure data,\nthere is again a significant increase in THC\nconcentration from F/A of 0.020 to 0.025 (Fig. 4).\nThe smoke number data are not available for this\nF/A of 0.025.\n\nThe data taken at the combustors shows that in the\n75 psia (0.52 MPa) data, the combustor efficiency\nat F/A = 0.025 is slightly lower than the rest\n(Table 1). At a 3% \xce\x94P, the efficiency of all fuel\nblends averages to 99.64% with a standard\ndeviation of 0.024 for F/A of 0.010, 0.015, and\n0.020. However, at 0.025, the average efficiency is\n99.25% with a standard deviation of 0.058. Similar\ntrends are shown at 4% \xce\x94P, with averages and\nstandard deviations of 99.56 and 0.011 as well as\n99.05 and 0.080, respectively, along with 5% \xef\x81\x84P\nwith averages and standard deviations of 99.47 and\n0.013 as well as 98.99 and 0.181, respectively.\n\nIt is possible that a F/A of 0.025 represents the\ncombustor efficiency drop-off ratio as the amount\nof uncombusted or poorly combusted fuel rises\nsignificantly, contributing to higher emissions as\nshown in CO and THC data (Figs. 2 and 4).\n\nThe efficiency difference between the first three\nF/A ratios and the fourth is much more significant\nthan between the various types of fuel, as shown by\nthe standard deviation. The data at 5% \xce\x94P and F/A\n= 0.025 ratio is the one exception, as the difference\nbetween fuel blends is definite. The efficiency\ndifference between fuel blends is more pronounced\nat higher %\xce\x94P and F/A. The combustor efficiency\nfor all three blends decreases as \xce\x94P increases, but\nfor all F/A values before 0.025 the efficiency\ndifferences between the blends are insignificant.\nSmoke and Photodiode Numbers\n\nFig.4 Total hydrocarbon (THC) emission (ppm)\nvariation with %FT fueling and F/A for combustor\ninlet pressure of 75 psia (0.52 MPa) at 5% \xce\x94P.\nTrending for THC emissions is inconclusive, but\nthe large emissions increase is again apparent as\nF/A approaches 0.025.\n\nThe smoke number measurements were taken by\nfiltering an exhaust sample and comparing the\nchange in reflectance. The smoke data and the total\nhydrocarbon emissions (THC, ppm) are expected\nto be somewhat correlated. The smoke number data\nfrom this testing run is partially incomplete, but the\ndata obtained show some definite trends. Smoke\nnumber decreases as 100% FT fueling is\napproached, with more distinct decreases at higher\nF/A (Fig. 5). Figure 5 illustrates this with the\navailable smoke number data.\n\nTable 1 Combustor efficiency data summary at 75 psia (0.52 MPa).\n3%\n4%\n5%\n\xe2\x88\x86P\nF/A\n0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020\n0.025 0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020\n0.025 0.010\xe2\x80\x930.020\nAverage\n99.64\n99.25\n99.56\n99.05\n99.47\nJP-8\n99.61\n99.32\n99.56\n99.10\n99.46\n50:50\n99.65\n99.24\n99.56\n99.09\n99.46\nFT\n99.66\n99.20\n99.58\n98.96\n99.48\nSt. Dev.\n0.024\n0.058\n0.011\n0.080\n0.013\n\n0.025\n98.99\n99.20\n98.90\n98.87\n0.181\n\n4\n\nFig.5 Smoke number variation with %FT fueling\nfor combustor inlet pressure of 175 psia\n(1.21 MPa) at 5% \xce\x94P at varied F/A. The lower\nsmoke number indicates that SPK-FT fuels are\ncleaner burning than JP-8 fuels, especially at\nhigher F/A.\n\nFig.6 Variation in photodiode voltage output with\nfuel blending at various F/A values, 75 psia\n(0.52MPa) at 5% \xce\x94P. The decrease in luminosity\nas the %FT fuel approaches 100% is\ndemonstrated.\n\nFig.7 Digital camera photographs showing flame changes with changes in fuel blend at\nF/A = 0.020. The JP-8 fuel is visibly more luminous.\nThe change in flame photodiode luminosity is\nrelated to all variables tested. It increases with F/A\nand decreases steadily with increasing %\xce\x94P and\n%FT composition (Fig. 6). The decreased\nluminosity of the 50:50 blend and the FT fuel show\nthat they are cleaner burning fuels than JP-8\n(Fig. 7). The luminosity indicates carbon presence\nin the flames, and therefore the potential for carbon\ndeposits within or coming through the engine to be\nreleased into the environment. The decrease in\nluminosity as the fuel blend approaches full FT\nfuel implies that the radiative heat loss is also\ndecreasing as would liner temperature. This\ndecrease occurs across increasing %\xce\x94P and\ndecreased F/A as well, signifying lower heat losses,\ncleaner burning, and a higher exit temperature from\nthe combustor engine.\nParticulate Emissions\nThe particulate emissions of any fuel are of utmost\nconcern for both environmental and human health.\n\nLike the gaseous emissions, they relate to engine\ntemperature and pressure, %\xce\x94P, F/A, and fuel\ncomposition. The data available from this study\ndoes demonstrate the clear reduction in particulate\nemissions from FT fuel at all pressures and F/A\nvalues (Fig. 8). Because the particulate emission\nsize-distribution data available from this particular\nstudy was not enough to make definite conclusions,\nthe effects of particulates will be left for another\npaper. A figure of particulate sample size\ndistributions has been included (Fig. 9) to illustrate\nagain the significant difference between pure FT\nfuel and the blend and JP-8. The total number of\nparticulates is visibly smaller, as is the peak size of\nthe particles. This indicates the need for further\nstudies into the size-related particle health effects.\nThere are many analyses underway to characterize\nand compare particulate emissions for alternate\nfuels (e.g., alternative fuels testing on a C-17\naircraft [3]).\n\n5\n\nFig.8 Particulate emissions number index\nvariations with test pressure and F/A for JP-8,\n50:50 FT blend, and FT fueling. (Note: Test\ndata set incomplete at 75 and 225 psia (0.52\nand 1.55 MPa) for F/A = 0.015 and at 225 psia\nfor F/A = 0.025) [1].\n\nFig.9 Alternate fueling particle size distribution with JP-8,\n50:50 FT blend, and FT for combustor pressure at 75 psia\n(0.52 MPa) and F/A = 0.025 [2].\nThe effect of these particulate emissions on human\nhealth has been concluded by a number of\nresearchers, and the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency has launched a program involving multiple\nresearch centers to further investigate the hazards.\nThe hazards include distress in respiratory and\ncardiovascular function\xe2\x80\x94contributing to the\ndevelopment or worsening of common distresses\nsuch as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisorder, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction\n(heart attack), and more. The possibility and\n\nproblems associated with particles moving into the\nblood stream and being transported to other vital\norgans is also being considered [4].\nEngine Emissions Testing\nFurther testing that provides other insight into\nparticulate emissions for both small and large\nengines has been done in collaboration with a large\ngroup of organizations, including government\nagencies, private industries, and educational\ninstitutions.\n\n6\n\nTesting run by General Electric showed that for\nalternate fuels, the emissions level of the regulated\nemissions (NOx, CO, hydrocarbons, and smoke\nnumber) were within the limits set for traditional\nfuels. The GE study observed power levels starting\nfrom idle through to take-off, capturing a full\nperformance that the data in this paper does not\nspan. This study corroborates our results,\npresenting alternative fuel emissions and indicating\nthat similar trends occur all through the flying\nprocess, offering further insight for true life cycle\nanalysis [5].\nA small-engine test with similar fuel parameters to\nours was conducted with a Pratt & Whitney small\nturbine engine, including 100% FT fuel and JP-8 as\nwell as a 50% blend. The trends observed in this\ntest were similar, with small reductions in NOx\nemissions as the SPK-FT fuel percentage\nincreased, especially at higher power. The smoke\nnumber data was more conclusive, with the FT\nfuels\nhaving\nsignificantly\nlower\nsmoke\nmeasurements than the JP-8 fuel [6].\nLarger engine tests, such as those conducted in the\nAlternate Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX)\nstudy [7], point in the same direction with regards\nto emissions trends. The C-17 test also tested both\ngaseous and particulate emissions data with similar\nresults [3].\nEmissions Implications\nThe European Union has recently moved to\nimplement a carbon emissions tax on airlines\nflying in and out of its airspace, an act that has\nenraged officials in foreign countries such as the\nUnited States and China. America\xe2\x80\x99s aviation\nindustry contributes approximately 2% of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and a law requiring\npayment per metric ton of carbon emission would\nstrike a huge blow to an already troubled industry\n[8]. In order to maintain current flight profit and\navailability as well as market competitiveness, it is\nnecessary for countries to move towards alternate\nfuels such as those proposed in this paper.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nGathering preliminary data is essential for\nestablishing baseline information to compare\nperformance and emissions data for alternate-fuelflexible combustor-sector systems. Observing pure\nSPK (FT) and blended fuel with respect to JP8+100 fuels can lead to the future development of\n\nnew, efficient, and effective combustor systems for\nthese up-and-coming types of fuel. Fuel-flexible\nsystems are the near-term goal for the industry, and\nanalysis of combustor performance is necessary to\ncontinue down the alternative fuel path. The data\nfrom Combustor A summarized in this paper\nprovide analysis and comparison based on a variety\nof engine variables.\nInlet temperature and pressure, fuel-to-air ratio,\ncombustor pressure drops, and fuel blends were the\nparameters varied for this study.\nGenerally, the gaseous emissions varied more\nbased on fuel-to-air ratio (F/A) than the fuel blend\nused. This indicates that both 100% FT and the\n50:50 blend emit at or under currently acceptable\nrates. While the differences were not enormous, FT\nfuel did have generally lower NOx emissions, one\nof the primary regulated emissions species today.\nHowever, at higher F/A, the combustor efficiency\ndrops and emissions increase more with FT fuel\nblends than JP-8.\nThe smoke number differences were very distinct\nand point to the fact that, as hoped, SPK fuels are\ncleaner burning than JP-8 fuels, and the 50:50\nblend is an intermediate step towards\nenvironmentally friendly fuel. It is important to\nnote that a 50:50 blend does not directly correlate\nto a 50% reduction in smoke or emissions, which\nhas implications towards the effectiveness of using\na blend as an economic substitute.\nMultiple studies and data sets show that SPK fuel\nand fuel blends do not have a significant negative\nimpact on the performance of combustor sector\nsystems, and that emissions produced certainly do\nnot exceed the current limitations on traditional\nfuel. Taking into account the life cycle analysis and\nemissions reduction for alternate fueling, these\nSPK fuels are a promising near-term alternative for\njet fuels.\nReferences\n[1] Stratton, R.W., Wong, H.M., and Hileman, J.,\n2010, \xe2\x80\x9cLife Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nfrom Alternate Jet Fuels.\xe2\x80\x9d Partnership for Air\nTransportation Noise and Emissions Reduction,\nProject 28.\nhttp://web.mit.edu/aeroastro/partner/reports/\nproj28/partner-proj28-2010-001.pdf\n[2] Shouse, D.T., Neuroth, C., Hendricks, R.C.,\nLynch, A., Frayne, C.W., Stutrud, J.S.,\n7\n\nCorporan, E., and Hankins, Capt.
