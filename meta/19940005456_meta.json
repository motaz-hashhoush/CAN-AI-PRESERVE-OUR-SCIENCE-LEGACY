Ground launches can force the parking orbit plane to contain the v-infinity vector by using launch azimuth and lift-off time as independent variables. When launching from the Space Station, a new set of variables comes into play. The Space Station orbit is of fixed inclination but precessing due to the Earth's oblateness. Its plane will seldom (and may never) contain the desired v-infinity vector. Consequently, the departure strategy will usually require multiple burns and include a plane change. Also, the concept of 'launch window' will be somewhat different from Earth surface launches. An analysis of the deployment of interplanetary spacecraft from the Space Station is described, with emphasis on the effect of the trajectory characteristics on station operations. Several planetary mission types are analyzed, including manned Mars missions and unmanned high declination departures. The constraint of Space Station orbit nodal position is quantified and the operational implications for Space Station reboost strategy are examined.", "title": "Space vehicle deployment from Space Station", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940005456, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Henry, Paul K."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2a70ce6ef50849e0a2a4856cfde8fb96"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940005456, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940005456, "id": "18d3f0a6d0f14def90cf4491b4ddc0c3", "publicationName": "NASA.
