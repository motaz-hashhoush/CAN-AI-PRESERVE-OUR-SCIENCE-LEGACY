Called the Five Year Light, it has a shelf life at least that long because there is no power drain on the batteries when the flashlight is not in use. The NASA version of the light was developed under contract with Langley Research Center by ACR Electronics, Inc., now known as the Chromalloy Electronics Division of Chromalloy American Corporation, Hollywood, Florida. NASA wanted a light that had long shelf life and assured reliability in case it was needed in an emergency. Reliability was designed into the flashlight by means of a unique switch. Instead of the customary thumb-button, the Five Year Light is turned on by rotating its collar to make contact with the battery terminal; the turning motion wipes away any corrosion that might be present and makes contact virtually certain. The Five Year Light available commercially is a repackaged version of the NASA light. It is sold for car, home, industrial, police, firefighting, recreational and a variety of other uses, and sales have topped two million units.", "title": "Five Year Flashlight", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T22:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070018907, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070018907, "id": "908a807f16c0491aab1e787b602b4ad9", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1978", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070018873, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1978", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070018907.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070018907/downloads/20070018907.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070018907/downloads/20070018907.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070018907/downloads/20070018907.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
