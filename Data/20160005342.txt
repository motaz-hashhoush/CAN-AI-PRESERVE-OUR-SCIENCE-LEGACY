b'Low-Mass, Low-Power Hall\nThruster System\nNASA is developing an electric propulsion system capable of producing\n20 mN thrust with input power up to 1,000 W and specific impulse ranging\nfrom 1,600 to 3,500 seconds. The key technical challenge is the target mass of\n1 kg for the thruster and 2 kg for the power processing unit (PPU). In Phase I,\nBusek Company, Inc., developed an overall subsystem design for the thruster/\ncathode, PPU, and xenon feed system. This project demonstrated the feasibility\nof a low-mass power processing architecture that replaces four of the DC\xe2\x80\x93DC\nconverters of a typical PPU with a single multifunctional converter and a lowmass Hall thruster design employing permanent magnets.\nIn Phase II, the team developed an engineering prototype model of its lowmass BHT-600 Hall thruster system, with the primary focus on the low-mass\nPPU and thruster. The goal was to develop an electric propulsion thruster with\nthe appropriate specific impulse and propellant throughput to enable radioisotope electric propulsion (REP). This is important because REP offers the\nbenefits of nuclear electric propulsion without the need for an excessively large\nspacecraft and power system.\n\nApplications\n\nNASA photo\n\nFor radioisotope electric propulsion (REP)\n\nPhase II Objectives\n}} Develop a low-mass BHT-600 Hall\nthruster system, with the primary\nfocus on the low-mass PPU and\nthruster\n}} Design, fabricate, and demonstrate\nan engineering model version of a\nlow-mass (2 kg) PPU and a low-mass\n(1 kg) version of the BHT-600 thruster\n}} Conduct an integrated system test\nand deliver a prototype PPU and\nthruster system\n\t\nBenefits\n\nNASA\n\nCommercial\n\n}} Orbiters around Pluto, Neptune,\nand Uranus\n}} Rendezvous and Centaurs,\nKuiper belt objects, and primitive\nbodies in the outer solar system\n}} Extensive surveys of major\nasteroid groups\n\n}} Low-power electric\npropulsion systems\n}} Low-power Hall effect\nthruster systems\n}} Commercial satellite\nmanufacturers:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Primary propulsion on low\nEarth orbit spacecraft\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Station keeping on\ngeostationary satellites\n\n}} Low mass\n}} Low power\n\nFirm Contact\nBusek Company, Inc.\nBruce Pote\nbpote@busek.com\n11 Tech Circle\nNatick, MA 01760\xe2\x80\x931023\nPhone: 508\xe2\x80\x93655\xe2\x80\x935565\nProposal Number: 09-2 S3.04-8131\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218829\n\n3\n\n'
