Contact chains are formed beside the integrated circuits, each contact chain formed of the same two layers as the circuits, in the form of conductive segments alternating between the upper and lower layers and with the ends of the segments connected in series through interfaces. A current source passes a current through the series-connected segments, by way of a pair of current tabs connected to opposite ends of the series of segments. While the current flows, voltage measurements are taken between each of a plurality of pairs of voltage tabs, the two tabs of each pair connected to opposite ends of an interface that lies along the series-connected segments. A plot of interface conductances on normal probability chart enables prediction of the yield of good integrated circuits from the wafer.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870000798, "id": "b24973def4934e9084a54501c94c46f0", "publicationDate": "1986-06-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870000798.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870000798/downloads/19870000798.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870000798/downloads/19870000798.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870000798/downloads/19870000798.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
