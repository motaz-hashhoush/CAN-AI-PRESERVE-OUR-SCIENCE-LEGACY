The author reviews the status and progress on the key hardware. The first primary mirror segments are already at MSFC for cryogenic tests, the mid IR instrument (MIRI) has already had successful tests of the engineering model, and the detectors are showing excellent performance. The author also describes the scientific objectives of the mission, with emphasis on the predicted capabilities for observing planets by the transit technique and through direct imaging. Recent direct observations of planets by HST and by adaptive optics from the ground have shown that, under favorable circumstances, much can be learned.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090016206, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Indiana Univ.", "location": "Bloomington, IN, United States"}}, "meetingId": "e60a9dc34c1d49cd95adc3dbf67037fb", "id": "1dd939f66ef44261a79c793351387bc2"}], "name": "Seminar at Indiana University", "location": "Indiana", "id": "e60a9dc34c1d49cd95adc3dbf67037fb", "startDate": "2009-04-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090016206, "id": "3dfba8bf4df6433090b11c4df13b36ee", "publicationDate": "2009-04-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
