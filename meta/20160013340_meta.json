Electric field imaging (EFI) technology may be applied to characterize intrinsic or existing electric potentials and electric fields, or an externally generated electrostatic field may be used for (illuminating) volumes to be inspected with EFI. The baseline sensor technology, electric field sensor (e-sensor), and its construction, optional electric field generation (quasistatic generator), and current e-sensor enhancements (ephemeral e-sensor) are discussed. Demonstrations for structural, electronic, human, and memory applications are shown. This new EFI capability is demonstrated to reveal characterization of electric charge distribution, creating a new field of study that embraces areas of interest including electrostatic discharge mitigation, crime scene forensics, design and materials selection for advanced sensors, dielectric morphology of structures, inspection of containers, inspection for hidden objects, tether integrity, organic molecular memory, and medical diagnostic and treatment efficacy applications such as cardiac polarization wave propagation and electromyography imaging.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160013340, "endDate": "2016-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2016 Annual Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation (QNDE)", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "832a8747e5f4485c84d037f77771a60f", "startDate": "2016-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160013340, "id": "ebfb3280f3eb4b50beec30179904012f", "publicationDate": "2016-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160013340.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160013340/downloads/20160013340.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160013340/downloads/20160013340.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160013340/downloads/20160013340.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
