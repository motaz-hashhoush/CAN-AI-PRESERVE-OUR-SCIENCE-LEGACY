To do so, it is necessary to find ways\n\nF\n\nof protecting engine components from the\nextremely hot environment.\nResearchers have explored - and\ncontinue to explore - advanced, temperature resistant materials and a variety of\nconcepts for cooling interior engine parts.\nLewis Research Center came up with a\npromising approach: to protect hot components by use of thermal barrier coatings, or\nTBCs, plasma-sprayed substances deposited\non the components in thicknesses measured\nin thousandths of an inch.\nA TBC consists of an outer layer,\nor "top coat" of ceramic material, plus a\nmetallic "bond coat" inner layer. The lowconductivity ceramic coating insulates the\ncomponent from the hot gases of the\nengine; the bond coat offers oxidation and\ncorrosion resistance to the component and\nincreases the adherence of the top coat.\nResearch testing has shown that TBCs can\nreduce component surface temperatures by\n200 degrees Centigrade or more.\n97\n\nLewis Research Center, together\nwith industry firms working under Lewis\ncontract and on their own, have successfully\ndeveloped TBCs that have been routinely\noperating on certain parts of aircraft engines\nfor some time and ongoing research is\npaving the way for extending the coating\nprocess to "hotter" engine components.\nAn example of industry use of the\nNASAdeveloped TBC concept is the application of the coating to engines produced\nby General Electric Aircraft Engines\n(GEAE), Cincinnati, Ohio. GEAE was one\nof three contractors that evaluated TBC\nperformance under contract to Lewis (the\nothers were Pratt & Whitney Division of\nUnited Technologies and Garrett\n&Research). GEAE applied this experience to a TBC now in regular service as a\ncoating on production engines.\nThe company\'s primary TBC application is a coating on combustor liners in\nboth commercial and military aircraft\nengines, along with coatings on exhaust liners, flaps, seals and afterburners in military\nengines (in the photo, the component at left\nis a combustor liner for the CF6 engine that\npowers commercial jetliners and the other\ncomponent is a flameholder for the F404\nengine that powers military fighter aircraft).\nThe coating system used for combustors and exhaust components, based on the\none developed by Lewis Research Center,\nconsists of a plasma-sprayed nickel/chromium/aluminum/yttrium bond coat and an\nyttrium-stabilized zirconia top coat. These\ncoatings extend component life from 1.3 to\ntwo times by reducing the temperature of\nthe metal in the component. GEAE is also\ntesting TBCs on components that operate at\nhigher temperatures, such as stator vanes\nand turbine blades, and plans to expand\nproduction applications of TBCs.\n\n'
