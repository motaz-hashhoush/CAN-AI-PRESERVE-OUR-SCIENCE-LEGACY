KERSHNER\n\nSATELLITES\n\nNAVIGATION\n\nApplied Physics Laboratory\nThe Johns Hopkins University\n\nOne of the earliest suggestions for a practical operating satellite system to accomplish a practical terrestrial objective to receive financial support was a\nsystem for global navigation. The system, supported\n\nthe stable satellite\n\ninitially by the Department\nof Defense\'s\nAdvanced\nResearch Projects Agency, was the outgrowth of work\ndone by William Guier and George Weiffenbach\nat\nthe Applied Physics Laboratory of The Johns Hopkins\n\nquencies, it is possible to make a good approximate\ncorrection for the major ionospheric refraction effect.\nProgress on this system, as reported in the open\nliterature up to 1963, was very encouraging.\nIn particular, enough was published during this period to\nestablish the fact that the limitation on accuracy for\nthe system would be determined\nby the knowledge of\ngeodesy since the largest uncertainty would result from\n\nUniversity in the very sophisticated\nanalysis of the\ndoppler shift from the first Sputnik.\nThe specific\nsuggestion for a possible navigation system, based on\na similar precise analysis of the doppler shift resulting from the relative motion of an artificial satellite\nand a ground observing station to yield an accurate\ndetermination\nof the position of the ground station\nfrom a knowledge\nof the satellite orbit, was due to\nFrank McClure of the Applied Physics Laboratory,\nand the first special NASA award for contribution to\nspace technology was given to Dr. McClure for this\nconcept.\nThe detailed system to accomplish global navigation with the aid of special artificial satellites was embodied in a program under the code name of Transit\nin 1959, and responsibility\nfor the development\nwas\ntransferred\nfrom ARPA to the Navy in 1960.\nThe\nproposed system concept, as widely described at that\ntime, is shown in figure I. It includes a constellation\nof four satellites\nat 45 \xc2\xb0 intervals,\n\nin polar orbits, with orbital\nwhich transmit two coherent\n\nplanes\nstable\n\nmotion\n\noscillator\n\nof the transmitter\n\nbecause\n(satellite)\n\nof the relative\nand\n\nreceiver\n\n(ground point fixed on a rotating earth).\nBecause of\nthe transmission and reception of two coherent fre-\n\nthe knowledge of the satellite orbit which, in turn,\nwas limited by our knowledge of the force field which\ncontrols the satellite orbit. Unfortunately,\nin March\n1963, a change in policy resulted in the classification\nof this project so that we can not report in an unclassified manner the current status of this specific\nprogram.\nNASA\n\nhas\n\nbeen\n\nobserving\n\nthe\n\nprogress\n\nof this\n\nprogram to determine whether or not it would meet\ngeneral civilian and commercial\nneeds for a global\nnavigation system.\nIt has tentatively determined\nthat\nthe program has certain disadvantages,\nas far as general purpose, nonmilitary\nuse is concerned,\nthat are\nsufficiently restrictive to warrant a serious search for\nalternative systems.\nQuite recently there has been\nannounced the results of a study program, carried out\n\nto obtaining\n\nby General Electric (GE)\nthat proposes an alternative system that is believed, by some, to more nearly\nmeet the needs of a general-purpose\ncivilian system.\nThe general concept of the GE system is to establish a system of a large number of satellites distributed\nwith random phase about four different orbits at an\naltitude of some 6,000 miles.\nIn addition, the system\n\nthe orbit information,\nthe user also measures the doppler shift exhibited\non the received frequency\nfrom\n\nhas six ground stations strategically located about the\nglobe.\nIt can be shown that with an appropriate,\n\nfrequencies.\nAlso, modulations\nthese frequencies\nwhich signify\n\nare imposed\non\nthe contents\nof a\n\nsatellite memory which can be loaded from the ground.\nThis transmission\nis a simple communication\nchannel\nwhich makes available to the user a recent determination of the satellite\n\norbit.\n\nIn addition\n\n127\n\n128\n\n-\n\n..\n\nr\n\nPEACEFUL USES OF SPACE\n\nFIGURE.--Operationai Navy satellite navigation system.\n1\nrelatively large, number of satellites there will always\nbe essentially, for any potential user, two satellites\nwhich are simultaneously within his line of sight and\nwithin the line of sight of one of the six ground stations. When a user desires his position he sends out\na simple signal which is relayed by all satellites within\nline of sight. A ground station which receives this\nrequest for position from two separate satellites responds by sending out a time impulse. This time\nimpulse is relayed by the two satellites from which\nthe request was received on to the user and is simply\nechoed back by the user via the same two satellites to\nthe ground station. By measurement of the time difference in these paths, the ground station, which, of\ncourse, knows the satellite position, can compute a\ntriangulation for the user and establish his position, or\nat least two alternative positions. This information is\nthen sent to the user, again by a satellite as a relay\npoint. The user generally can readily select the correct\none between the two possible positions since they\nusually differ quite widely.\nThe considerations which lead t this system proo\nposal were, of course, quite different from those which\ndictated the system selection of the Navy. In the case\nof the Navy\'s system, the entire cost of establishing\nand maintaining the system and paying for user equip-\n\nment is all carried by the same organization, and the\nproper consideration is to meet the objectives with a\nminimum overall cost of system plus user equipments.\nThere also are a relatively small number of user equipments, so that it is quite reasonable to pay a substantial amount for user equipment if by so doing the\nsystem establishment and maintenance costs can be\nreduced. For a general-purpose civilian system, however, in which user equipment cost must be paid by\nthe private shipowners, the system will attract users\nonly if shipboard equipment cost can be held quite\nlow. Thus, in principle, it is reasonable to consider\nsystems which are appreciably more expensive to establish and maintain if this more complex system can\nresult in greatly reduced user-equipment cost. But, of\ncourse, the deeper question of whether it is appropriate for the Government to provide such a service as a\nsubsidy or whether, alternatively, the economic considerations should provide for eventual amortization\nof the system costs by charges to the user must, of\ncourse, be decided ultimately by the Congress or the\nPresident.\nThe purpose for raising this issue, at this time, is\nsimply to take the opportunity to suggest to all within\nearshot that the economic considerations will, or at\nleast should be, very important in the decision-making\n\nNAVIGATION\n\nprocess\n\nto come, and that it may not be too late to\n\nconsider alternatives which could make an exceedingly\nlarge effect on the outcome of these economic considerations.\nFirst, it is apparent that NASA, in making a determination of the suitability of the Navy\'s navigation\napproach for civilian needs, simply considered the system as proposed and did not investigate the question\nas to whether it was possible to modify or augment the\nsystem to meet the requirements\nof civilian use for\nconsiderably\nless money than would be required by\nthe development\nof a totally new system.\nSecondly,\nand perhaps more important, if the pattern established\nin the past is followed, the decision with regard to\nimplementing\na civilian navigation\nsystem will be\nmade on the premise that a satellite system as a\nnavigation\naid will have to justify itself economically\non the assumption\nthat it accomplishes nothing else.\nNow the fact is that the satellite system required to\nimplement the GE navigation\nproposal is to all intents and purposes simply another intermediate\naltitude, random-orbit\ncommunication\nsystem.\nIt may\nhave rather specific requirements\nwith regard to reproAucibility of time delay but this is a minor technical\ndetail.\nIf the United States does establish, through\nthe ComSat Corp., or in any other way, a midaltitude,\nrandom-orbit\ncommunication\nsatellite system, adding\nto these satellites the requirement\nthat they be able to\naccept and relay the signals and messages required for\n\n129\n\nSATELLITES\n\nbased global navigation\nsystem.\nIn fact, since the\nEarth is largely water covered and elevations, even on\nland, are based on "sea level," the "shape"\nof the\nEarth is controlled by the gravitational\nfield; that is,\nthe liquid surface of the Earth will form an equipotential surface in the gravitational\nfield (with proper\nallowance for the effect of rotation).\nThus, knowing\nthe gravity field is equivalent to knowing the shape\nof geoid, i.e., the equipotential\nsurface.\nAnd knowing the shape of the Earth is obviously necessary to\nprovide accurate global navigation even by Earth-based\nsystems such as Omega.\nIn summary, progress in global navigation accuracy,\nwith or without satellites, is dependent on progress in\ngeodesy.\nFor this reason, it seems appropriate to indicate here the current status of geodesy.\nIt is particularly appropriate to discuss this matter since geodesy\nconstitutes another of the practical applications of artificial satellites for accomplishing a terrestrial objective.\nBefore the advent of artificial satellites, the Earth\nwas considered\n\nto be an oblate spheroid,\n\nsouth dissymmetry.\nThis fact, referred to in the press\nby the phrase "pear-shaped"\n(figure 2), was deduced\n\na navigation system of the GE type might make very\nlittle difference in the design and costs of the satellite.\nIn this case, the economic consideration\ninvolved becomes markedly\n\ndifferent.\n\nIt is granted that the exceedingly complex gnvernmental and industrial boundary conditions that exist\nin the communication\nsatellite area make this suggestion very difficult to implement, but surely somewhere\nthere is a big enough system.\nWhatever system is used to establish navigation on\na worldwide basis with the aid of artificial satellites,\nit is clear that the accuracy of the system is dependent, among other things, on the accuracy with which\nthe satellites can be tracked.\nAnd this, in turn, is\ndependent\non the precision with which the forces,\nprimarily gravitation,\nwhich act on the satellite, are\nknown.\n\nIn short, an accurate description\n\ntational force field is a prerequisite\ngation by satellites.\n\nof the gravi-\n\nto accurate navi-\n\nAlthough\nit is not quite so obvious, actually the\nsame information\nis required\nto establish an Earth-\n\nthat is, an\n\nellipsoid of revolution\nwith a circular equator but a\npolar flattening.\nThe first major departure from this\nshape was the determination\nby O\'Keefe that there\nwas an appreciable peaking at the north pole and flattening at the south pole which constituted\na north-\n\nFIGURE 2.--Pear-shaped\n\nEarth.\n\n130\n\nPEACEFUL\n\nfrom satellite\n\ntracking.\n\nUSES\n\nThe next major announced\n\nfact has been determined independently by Newton at\nthe Applied Physics Laboratory,\nbased on doppler\ntracking results.\nIt is customary, in geodetic research, to express the\ngravitation field in terms of a series expansion\nin\n\nIn 1963, Guier, of the Applied Physics Laboratory,\nused data from the doppler tracking of three satellites at different inclinations to
