Recalling initial instructions and using situational awareness principles, participants would escape a fire by choosing the appropriate door. Escape times would be measured while stressors increased. This presentation describes how STAY ALIVE utilizes first person point of view (PoV), a generic scenario, immersion- and presence-enhancing design, and ease of distribution to provide more people opportunity to realize, review, analyze and practice effective awareness behaviors. The goals for this prototype include facilitating interest in first-person PoV safety training and eliciting further suggestions on prevention technologies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130010122, "endDate": "2008-09-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Human Performance in Extreme Environments", "location": "New York, NY", "id": "e508a8fb07db41a8be74dfacd3945f7d", "startDate": "2008-09-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130010122, "id": "ebc3ea518afb404a81f200ae93469cac", "publicationDate": "2008-09-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130010122.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130010122/downloads/20130010122.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130010122/downloads/20130010122.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130010122/downloads/20130010122.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
