Kennedy Space Center in Florida, are exposed to a highly corrosive natural coastal marine environment. In addition, during launches, rocket exhaust deposition is also highly corrosive. Superhydrophobic coatings are being considered for additional corrosion protection on existing structures to enhance corrosion resistance and add an additional layer of protection against harsh environmental elements. These coatings have come into their own recently, and are now being investigated as corrosion protective coatings due to their water repelling capability. These coatings can be used on existing coatings, newly coated materials, or used on bare substrates. The coatings are not suitable for permanent corrosion protection, but can be used where additional corrosion control is desired or only when temporary corrosion control is needed, such as in hardware sitting on a launch pad for 30-45 days prior to a launch. In this study, superhydrophobic coatings were applied on various coated and uncoated substrates and exposed to the spaceport environment for various times up to 60 days. This paper highlights the current results of the superhydrophobic coatings performance evaluated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150022490, "endDate": "2015-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Department of Defense", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "50ee59df923c41afa703e8b53f5547ad", "id": "232d7ca4858c40b9bc708510b4949045"}], "name": "2015 DOD-Allied Nations Technical Corrosion Conference", "location": "Pittsburgh, PA", "id": "50ee59df923c41afa703e8b53f5547ad", "startDate": "2015-11-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150022490, "id": "9c2eef1cd2da4bd1a73a146071c76009", "publicationDate": "2015-11-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150022490.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150022490/downloads/20150022490.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150022490/downloads/20150022490.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150022490/downloads/20150022490.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
