Many valve manufacturing issues such as flow   passage   machining,   deep   hole   boring,   and   bi-metallic   joining   could   successfully   be addressed   with   this   new   technology.   The   goal   of   this   project   was   to   apply   additive manufacturing technology specifically to the problems that fluid control valves present. In order to properly apply additive manufacturing processes to the design of control valves, the plan was to manufacture samples using metals compatible with low temperature, high pressure oxygen service and then tested.  While vetting this project with manufacturers, it was determined that the materials chosen were not ideal for additive manufacturing due to their high reflectivity. Therefore, materials for this project were currently undergoing reevaluation and materials that are better suited for additive manufacturing may be substituted. During FY20, additional alloys were selected that would be both appropriate for high pressure oxygen environments as well appropriate for additive manufacturing processes.  However, final bid for manufacturing was six times   larger   than   the   available   funding   for   this   project.     Based   on   previous   additive manufacturing projects, the scope and funding for this project were appropriate, but a suitable manufacturer willing to provide a reasonable proposal, was not found. Therefore, funds were de-obligated for this project, and then re-obligated to augment another FY20 CIF project.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210013108, "id": "bc7469857d3e48d582f908c2b17f4e6c", "publicationDate": "2021-04-05T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "6 - Executive Summary_FY20 CIF - JDickey_Final.docx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210013108/downloads/6%20-%20Executive%20Summary_FY20%20CIF%20-%20JDickey_Final.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210013108/downloads/6%20-%20Executive%20Summary_FY20%20CIF%20-%20JDickey_Final.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210013108/downloads/6%20-%20Executive%20Summary_FY20%20CIF%20-%20JDickey_Final.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
