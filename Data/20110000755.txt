b'Hyperspectral Systems Increase Imaging Capabilities\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nand the sensor. ITD obtained a patent for the technology and then licensed it to a new company called Photon\nIndustries Inc. In 2005, Lextel Intelligence Systems LLC,\nof Jackson, Mississippi, purchased the company and its\nNASA-derived technology (Spinoff 2007).\nWithout the technical expertise to market the product,\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s license for the scanner returned to ITD.\nIn 2008, Themis Vision Systems LLC, of Richmond,\nVirginia, obtained an exclusive license for the technology.\nThe CEO of Themis, Mark Allen Lanoue, was one of\nthe original researchers on the staff that developed the\ndevice at ITD and saw the potential for the technology.\nIn 2005, Lanoue, several colleagues, and the technology\nwere inducted into the Space Technology Hall of Fame,\ncreated by the Space Foundation, in cooperation with\nNASA, to increase public awareness of the benefits that\nresult from space exploration programs and to encourage\nfurther innovation.\n\nW\n\nhile the human eye can see a range of phenomena in the world, there is a larger range\nthat it cannot see. Without the aid of technology, people are limited to seeing wavelengths of visible\nlight, a tiny range within the electromagnetic spectrum.\nHyperspectral imaging, however, allows people to get a\nglimpse at how objects look in the ultraviolet (UV) and\ninfrared wavelengths\xe2\x80\x94the ranges on either side of visible light on the spectrum.\nHyperspectral imaging is the process of scanning and\ndisplaying an image within a section of the electromagnetic spectrum. To create an image the eye can see, the\nenergy levels of a target are color-coded and then mapped\nin layers. This set of images provides specific information\nabout the way an object transmits, reflects, or absorbs\nenergy in various wavelengths.\nUsing this procedure, the unique spectral characteristics of an object can be revealed by plotting its energy\nlevels at specific wavelengths on a line graph. This creates a\nunique curve, or signature. This signature can reveal valuable information otherwise undetectable by the human\neye, such as fingerprints or contamination of groundwater\nor food.\nOriginally, NASA used multispectral imaging for\nextensive mapping and remote sensing of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nsurface. In 1972, NASA launched the Earth Resources\nTechnology Satellite, later called Landsat 1. It had the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s first Earth observation satellite sensor\xe2\x80\x94a multispectral scanner\xe2\x80\x94that provided information about the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface in the visible and near-infrared regions.\nLike hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging records\nmeasurements of reflected energy. However, multispectral imaging consists of just a few measurements, while\nhyperspectral imaging consists of hundreds to thousands\nof measurements for every pixel in the scene.\nIn 1983, NASA started developing hyperspectral systems at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The first system,\n\n44\t\n\nHealth and Medicine \t\n\nThe Hyperion instrument onboard the Earth Observing-1\nspacecraft obtained these images of Iceland\xe2\x80\x99s Eyjafjallaj\xc3\xb6kull\nvolcano. The left-hand image was created with visible\nwavelengths; the right-hand picture is an infrared image.\n\nthe Airborne Imaging Spectrometer, led to the development of the powerful Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging\nSpectrometer (AVIRIS) that is still in use today. AVIRIS\nis connected to the outside of aircraft and is used to gather\ninformation to identify, measure, and monitor the environment and climate change. In 2001, NASA launched\nthe first on-orbit hyperspectral imager, Hyperion, aboard\nthe Earth Observing-1 spacecraft.\n\nPartnership\nBased on the hyperspectral imaging sensors used\nin Earth observation satellites, NASA engineers from\nStennis Space Center and researchers from the Institute\nfor Technology Development (ITD) collaborated on a\nnew design that was smaller and incorporated a scanner\nthat required no relative movement between the target\n\nProduct Outcome\nThemis delivers turnkey solutions in hyperspectral\nhardware, software, and algorithm development.\nWorldwide, Themis has built about 40 custom systems,\nincluding 3 at the Federal Bureau of Investigation\xe2\x80\x99s\nhyperspectral imaging laboratory in Quantico, Virginia.\nWith distributors and customers in more than 10\ncountries, Themis recently installed the first UV\nhyperspectral system in China to help with studies in\nforensic science, including fingerprint analysis.\nThe latest product lines from Themis include the\nTransluminous Series, the Optoluminous Series, and\nHyperVisual Software. What is most unique about these\nhyperspectral systems is their size. Themis has developed\ncompact, 4-pound systems\xe2\x80\x94as opposed to the larger, 7- and\n10-pound ITD versions\xe2\x80\x94that can fit on multiple platforms\nincluding microscopes, tripods, or production lines.\nThe Transluminous Series spans the spectrum from\nUV to infrared and uses a prism-grating-prism component\nto split incoming light into separate wavelengths. The\nSpinoff 2010\n\nOptoluminous Series, the newest line of\nreflective hyperspectral systems, uses a\nconvex grating reflective spectrograph to\ngather wavelengths. Both lines feature the\nNASA-derived scanning technique that\nrequires no relative movement between\nthe target and the sensor.\nThe HyperVisual Software is a graphical user interface-based software package\nfor end-user communication and control.\nDesigned for the Windows operating\nsystem, it converts scanned images into Based on the hyperspectral imaging sensors used in Earth observation\nsatellites, NASA engineers and Institute for Technology Development\na single image format containing spatial researchers collaborated on a portable design for imaging the health\nand spectral information.
