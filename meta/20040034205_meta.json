The type of flow which is most likely to be involved concerns convection currents. For the past 4 decades, models of mantle convection have made remarkable advancements. Although a large body of evidence regarding the seafloor depth, heat flow, lithospheric strength and forces of slab-pull and swell-push has been obtained, the global seismotectonic stresses in the Earth are yet to be determined. The problem is that no one has been able to come up with a satisfactory scenario that must characterize the stresses in the Earth which cause earthquakes and create tectonic features.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040034205, "endDate": "2003-12-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "57b9441d18de4e249bda6f9e565de60d", "id": "87dd45274f5744dea55052813d6e84fe"}], "name": "American Geophysical Union 2003 Fall Meeting", "location": "Sam Francisco, CA", "id": "57b9441d18de4e249bda6f9e565de60d", "startDate": "2003-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040034205, "id": "19a6b53852014084ab2e1ead6ee977b9", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
