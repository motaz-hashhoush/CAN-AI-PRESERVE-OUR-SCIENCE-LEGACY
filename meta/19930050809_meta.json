Critical relative velocities for coagulation were evaluated as a function of grain sizes for solicate, icy, and carbonaceous grains. It is concluded that efficient coagulation requires coverage of grain cores by an icy grain mantle. In this case, coagulation leads to only a doubling of the mass of a large grain within a dense core lifetime. It is concluded that coagulation can have a dramatic effect on the visible and, particularly, the UV portion of the extinction curve in dense clouds and on their IR spectrum.", "title": "Dust coagulation", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T01:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930050809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chokshi, Arati"}, "organization": {"name": "California Inst. of Technology", "location": "Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "abb58368411e408684f5ed61b143767d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930050809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tielens, A.
