LRO, designed, built, and operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, is gathering crucial data on the lunar environment that will help astronauts prepare for long-duration lunar expeditions. To date, the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) subsystem has operated nominally and met all requirements. However, during the early phase of the mission, the GN&C Team encountered some anomalies. For example, during the Solar Array and High Gain Antenna deployments, one of the safing action points tripped, which was not expected. Also, the spacecraft transitioned to its safe hold mode, SunSafe, due to encountering an end of file for an ephemeris table. During the five-day lunar acquisition, one of the star trackers triggered the spacecraft to transition into a safe hold configuration, the cause of which was determined. These events offered invaluable insight to better understand the performance of the system they designed. An overview of the GN&C subsystem will be followed by a mission timeline. Then, interesting flight performance as well as anomalies encountered by the GN&C Team will be discussed in chronological order.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100014880, "endDate": "2010-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2010 American Astronautical Society (AAS) Guidance and Control (G and C) Conference", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "745cc66cb88043ba825ca9a9b3dbfb81", "startDate": "2010-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100014880, "id": "13875a9e498c4f64a40796fb35866807", "publicationDate": "2010-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100014880.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100014880/downloads/20100014880.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100014880/downloads/20100014880.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100014880/downloads/20100014880.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
