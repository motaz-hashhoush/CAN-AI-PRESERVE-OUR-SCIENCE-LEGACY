With a gross weight of 4500 metric tons (5000 tons), more than 50 percent of which is  cargo, it will cruise at 50 meters per second (100 knots) in waves 2.4 meters (8 ft) high. Its peripheral jet-flexible skirt air cushion concept and air thrustors will let the freighter go over waves 8 meters high at reduced velocity. Power comes from a 1280 megawatt, helium-cooled thermal reactor. It could dock at any major port in the world, but because it needs no surface contact, it could also travel inland to land-locked ports. A modular terminal design and methods of cargo transfer are suggested. The concept of cargo containerization influences both the freighter and terminal design.", "title": "A nuclear powered air cushion freighter for the 1980's.", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T20:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720030765, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Anderson, J.
