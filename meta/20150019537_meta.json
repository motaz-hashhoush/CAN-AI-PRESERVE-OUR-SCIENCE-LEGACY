To reduce the cost and time to mature these emerging technologies, NASA is developing computational materials tools to improve understanding of the material and guide the certification process.", "title": "Materials Genome Initiative Element", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-10-20T18:48:49.2300000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150019537, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vickers, John"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "3da7bd482c9d44ca9bd457952fd83ce2"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Brief Communication/Note", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150019537, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150019537, "id": "6ff4b53c069b4a129b200396661e2189", "publicationDate": "2015-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150019537.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150019537/downloads/20150019537.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150019537/downloads/20150019537.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150019537/downloads/20150019537.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
