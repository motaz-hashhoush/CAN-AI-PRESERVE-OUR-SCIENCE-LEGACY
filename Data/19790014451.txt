INTRODUCTION\nThe utilization of solar energy from solar collectors has created a need\nfor a simple and realiable solar tracking control system that can locate and track\nthe Sun\'s position and consequently point concentrating type solar collectors\ntoward the Sun in the presence of all normal atmospheric conditions such as\nclear, haze, cloudy, and partly cloudy skies. For maximum efficiency solar\ncollectors should remain Sun oriented through any type of atmospheric condition.\nOther existing solar tracking control systems do not adequately follow the Sun in\ncloudy or partly cloudy weather and thus the performance of the collecting\nsystem has not operated as efficiently as expected.\nThe purpose of this report is to describe a simple solar tracking control\nsystem called the "Sun Chaser" designed to point toward the Sun in clear weather\nand to point in the near vicinity of the Sun when it is obscured by clouds or haze.\n\n11. DESCRI PTIONIAPPLICATIONS\nThe purpose of the "Sun Chaser" Controller is: (1) to detect a daylight\ncondition and initiate a tracking or pointing drive command to the gimbal motor,\nand (2) to detect an end-of-day condition and generate an east drive (reset)\ncommand. The components of the system are a silicon light sensor, an electronic\ncontrol module (solid state), and an electric motor.\nThe system automatically operates in one of four control modes initiated\nby the instantaneous solar flux falling on the sensor. The modes are tracki,g,\npointing, resetting, and parked. These modes are initiated only when both cells\nof the sensor simultaneousl,,, read the same predetermined light levels.\nFor example, if both cells detect a high level of flux, such as would\nresult from a clear sunlight condition, the tracking mode is initiated. If one or\nboth of the cells sees a lower threshold, indicating a cloud obstruction, etc., the\nsystem reverts to the pointing mode. When the light on both cells drop below\na level predetermined to be twilight (dusk) the system will initiate a reset mode.\nIn this mode the motor is driven until the sensor is aimed toward a sunrise\nposition. At this time the east mechanical limit switch opens and the motor remains in the parked mode position until daylight arrives. The definition of\ntracking and pointing is as follows:\n\na) Tracking \xe2\x80\x94 That mode in which the controller sensor detects an\nangular difference between the Sun and the sensor and generates a proportional\nerror signal. This error signal, when processed, becomes a motor drive\ncommand so as to reduce the error to zero. Thus, tracking is a Sun acquiring\nand looking mode.\nb) Pointing \xe2\x80\x94 In the pointing mode an internal oscillator constantly\ngenerates a pulse train which, when released by the logic circuits, becomes\nmotor drive commands. This pulse train is shaped to duplicate a typical\ntracking pulse train. Thus the system will, once synchronized, remain Sun\noriented even though there may be cloud obscurations.\nThe circuitry instantaneously reverts from one mode to another as\natmospheric conditions change.\nThe acquisition apertures of the Sun Chaser are designed to be relatively small angles, but once oriented the system should maintain a constant\nsynchronized cycle with the Earth\'s rotation. For design reasons it is\nimportant to establish realistic threshold levels that initiate the early morning,\ntrateking, pointing, and nite-time reset operate conditions. Since the drive\nmotor and gear ratios are chosen for a specific system application, certain\nselect-at-test components must also be chosen to create a final collector drive\nrate the same as that of the Earth\'s rotation (0.25 0 /min). These components\nare shown in Figure 2.\nThe circuitry contains two manual drive switches for initial collector\norientation, etc. These are shown as the east and west reset switches on\nFigure 2.\n\nIII. DISADVANTAGES OF PRESENT SUN TRACKERS\nSun trackers presently used include solar cell sensors, electronic circuitry, and electric motors. These trackers are generally similar to the Sun\nChaser described herein. They perform well in very clear skies with a bright\nSun, but will not continue to point toward the S`\'. \xe2\x96\xba under cloudy conditions. A\nwide field -of -view (FOV) of approximately 180 del; is necessary on these Sun\ntrackers because they are continually acquiring or reacquiring the Sun following\na period of haze or cloud cover. The required wide FOV makes the sensor\noverly sensitive to variations in scattered light levels, especially from bright\nclouds within its FOV. This characteristic can cause the tracker to acquire and\ntrack the cloud and especiadly to be led away from the Sun by a cloud that has\npassed the Sun (i.e., the Sun tract: gives way to a cloud track). These trackers\nwill also acquire and track holes in cloud coverage.\n\n0\nrc\n\n30.j\n\n0\naC\n\nO\nOC\n\n.i\nJ\nWW\n\n\t\n\nIV. MODE OF OPERATION\n\nA. Sun Sensor\nThe Sun sensor consists of two 0.,r) x 1.0 em silicon solar cells mounted\nIn an enclosure and positioned in a plane. normal to direct Sun rays. The cells\nare positioned on each side of a partition under translucent windows ( Fig. 2) .\nThe translucent windows are sized and positioned over the cells to form the\nacquisition and tracking apertures of the detector. The sensor module is\ndesigned to receive direct sunlight on exactly one-half the area of each cell when\nthe sensor is centered on the Sun while the other half of each cell is shadowed.\nAs the sensor is tilted, or as the Sun moves westward, the exposed area of the\nwest cell increases and the east cell decreases simultaneously. This area\nchange is directly proportional to the angular movement of the Sun. The arrangement of the cells is designed to obtain a linear output to f5 deg Sun angle.\n\xe2\x96\xbaLE X IM AS COV I\' R OOAOUE\n1 XCLFT FOR WINDOWS\n\n1.0 cm X0.1 cwt\nSOI UL R AM A ONCE LL\nm\t\n\n_ __ ^ _ _\n\nLlr -_\t\nO.tSnw\n\xe2\x96\xbaAHIIIIPN\t\n\n,o\n\nA t\t\n\n1l\t\n\nT\'\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nI\t\n\n}\n\n1\t\n\nI\nt\nt\t\nt\t\n- i ^Oi^^\t\n]{\t\n- -\t -\t\n\\\t\n\\\t\n1.51 -,^^ t 5/ \t\nM\t\n. m\t\n^U\t\nL is ^\t\n\n(\t\nt\n\n11\t\n\nr\n\nU\t\n\n1104\nO411\t\n\'\n^\'\t\n\nA-ART\n\nj1\t\n\nf\t\n7 In n^\t\n\n^ cm\t\n\nI\n\nII RMINAL\n\nMISI\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n1\xc2\xb1\t\n\n1 +\t\n\n^:4\t\n\n1\n\n1 1 I\t\n(1 1 I\n\n1\t I\t\n\n.... ....\t\n\n.. .\n\nRL ACK\nINSIDE\nWALLS\n\n1\t\n\nii I 11\n(I f\n1 1\t\n\nCENTERED\t\n\n1.0\t\n\n^\t\n\n^^t)R\n\nU(\t\n\n1\t\n\n7 1A\t\nIA >\xe2\x80\xa2 OS to SILICON SDLAR \t\nCELLS SOLDERED TO MINTED\t\nCIRCUIT FADS.

A further increase in Sun angle will decrease the area until at *15 deg\nthe cell will be totally shadowed.\nThe greatest angle required for a(quisition will occur between the time\nthe morning light passes the daylight threshold and the time the flux intensity is\nhigh enough for acquisition and track to begin. This time can range from a few\nminutes (very clear early mornii_;; light) to all day (no Sun). Normally a full\nday--of pulsing (no acquisition) will create less than a 5 deg error angle. This\nwill be a function of the winter/summer temperatures and its effect on the\nrepeatability of the drive system.\nThe inside of the module is black to increase the sensors selectivity to\nincident light. Scattered or nondirectional light raises the level of the sensors\noutputs but cannot be used in direction determinations. Since the magnitude of\nthe light is used to determine the mode of operation, it is important that the\nscattered light be kept to a minimum. The small apertures reduce the scattered\nlight effect from bright clouds near the Sun. This type cloud in the vicinity of\nthe Sun can create an unbalance in the sensor output which would result in\nerroneous pointing if the electronic circuit did not recognize and discriminate\nagainst these false targets (Section IV.B).\nThe outside of the module is white to reduce the Sun\'s heat on the module.\nSilicon cells were chosen for their wide light bandwidth and their stability in\nextreme temperature environments.\nThe cell sizes were chosen because of their commercial availability and\nbecause they are the largest size a standard operational amplifier (.LM 741) can\nload into. (The cells are power generating devices.)\nA clear window material is used as a cover to the enclosure to protect the\nwiring and to prevent atmospheric contamination of the cells. This wit,dow can\nalso be a polarized or infrared filter to increase the light wavelength selectivity\nof the cells.\n\nB. Electronic Control Assembly\nThe electronic control circuitry module (Fig. 4) contains microelectronic\ncomponents (amplifiers, comparators, oscillators, and TTL logic gates), two\nsolid-state relays (TTL to 115 V, 60 Hz), power supply (115 V, 60 Hz to f5\nVdc) , printed circuit board, and miscellaneous components ( resistors, diodes,\ncapacitors, wires, and fuses) integrated together to perform the following\nfunctions:\n\nr.\n\ni\nW\nf\nH\n\na\n\nW\nQQ\n\nd\n\nCt3^^\n\nGD\n.Mi\n\n,12\n\ny\n\ntd\nto\n\nU\n\nlw\nE\nw\n\nE\n\nu\nN\n\nQkn\nN\nC x\n= Q\n2\n\nH t^\n\nIs\n\n1) Condition the solar cell output signals to compatible levels and\nlinearize the voltage for the rest of the assembly.\n2) Determine when the sensed light levels are for a nighttime, a cloudy\nor haze daytime, or a bright sunny condition and initiate necessary corresponding commands. For example, when the light level on both cells drops below a\npredetermined level indicating night, the circuit initiates a "reset to east" drive\ncommand. When the light intensity rises above the night threshold (indicating\nlow-daylight) , the circuitry responds by generating a timing sequence in which\nthe motor is pulsed in approximately the same timed intervals as though tracking\nthe Sun. When the sunlight on both cells increases to a track level (high-daylight),\nthe circuit changes to a linear drive state and the system will drive east or west\nuntil Sun acquisition is attained and then pulse periodically as necessary to track\nthe Sun thereafter. The circuitry will create drive commands only as necessary\nto maintain an error angle leas than 0.25 (typical) deg between the tracker and\nthe Sun and will not track cloud movement.\n\nC. Circuit Operation\nThe signal conditioning amplifiers Al an: r.2 invert.., linearize, and\namplify the solar cell outputs to levels compatible with those needed by the other\ncircuit functions. This is done by selecting the feedback resistor (R f) to give\nthe desired output voltage swing (V o) for the greatest anticipated solar flux\nincident on the full area of each cell; i.e., Vo = cell Rf (Fig. 3) . Since the\nI\namplifier must deliver the cell current (I cell ) through the feedback resistor Rf,\nthe amplifi2r and its power supply must be chosen to adequately handle the power\ngenerated by the cells to achieve linear operation. The 0.5 x 1.0 cm cells were\nthe largest silicon solar cell area recommended to be power compatible with\nconventional operational amplifiers of the LM711 type.\nThe outputs of Al and A2 are each fed to three circuit functions: (1)\nsunset detector (SSD) , ( 2) intermediate light detectors (ILD) , and (3) linear\ndifferential tracking circuit (LDT).\nThe SSD circuit is a dual comparator connected to compare the linearized\ncell voltages, Vo , of each cell with a fixed voltage level. The fixed voltage level\n( approximately 10 mV) simulates a level of light representing; sunset or nighttime.\nThe dual comparators are connected in a manner that requires light levels on both\nsolar cells to be below the threshold for the output to go into a high voltage state.\nWhen this condition is met, a constant east motor drive Is initiated through the\nsolid-state power relay and all other circuit functions are inhibited by the TTL\n\n9\n\ni\n\n"NOI:\' gates. The motor then drives the collectors and sensor back to the east\n\ndirection until a mechanical actuated limit switch opens the motor circuit.\nThe system is then le a "sunrise" orientation. There is also a mechanical\nlimit switch on the ex.reme west side of the drive to open the circuit and stop\nthe west drive at about the sundown position(for safety purpose\'.\nThe ILD circuit is activated when the light intensity is above night and\nbelow a high daytime inte-sity. When the morning; light increases above the\ntoggle point of the SSD comparators, its output changes state (bsck to low) and\nthe normal low daytime RA) threshold is passed. At this time both sensors ary\nbelow a light level required for track and are, thus, in the area designated as\n"intermediate." In this area, the ILD circuit inhibits the linear west and night\np\ndrive sip ala and releases the puine generator output to the west drive motor\nrelay. The motor -will dr. pulsed by the internal generator at essentially the\nsame rate ( Earth\'s rat-) as though it were locked to the Sun. This will continue until both cells are receiving; tracking; level incident light. At this time\n(day high), the ILD circuit output goes to a high state, the pulse generator\noutput is inhihiied, and the linear drive inhibit is released. Since the Sun will\nbe well within the ;acquisition angle of the detector, the system will then drive\nin the direction (eas t or west) necessary to acquire and null on the Sun. The\ncircuit will continue iockcd on the Sun unless interrupted by clouds or nightfall.\nIn the ID\'I\' operation, the motor drives in gnilsed intervals. The circuit\nis designed to pulse only long; enoug;li to reduce the error voltage to zero and,\nconsequently, the Sun error to zero. The off time, which is a fcinetion of light\nintensity, represents the time it tales the Sun to move approximately 0. 25 deg\nand is approximately 1 min. The circuit has hysteresis to optimize the motor\non/off time to prevent rapid on/off cycling; and unnecessary wear on the motor.\nSince the comparators are comparing the light level of both cells simultaneously,\nthe system discriminates against following; a bright cloud that may pass the Sun.\nThis occurs because the passing cloud may cause one cell level to drop its\noutput below the 11.0 threshold and, thus, will cause Uic system to instantly\nchange from a tracking; to a pointing mode. In this mode the motor is, as stated\npreviously, time-px\xe2\x96\xba lsed westward until .\xe2\x80\xa2 clouds nre clear of the Sun.\n\nD.

TEST RESULTS\nFigure 5 shows a typical response of the Sun Chaser control system to\nboth clear and cloudy conditions. Channel 1 represents solar intensity,\nChannel 2 the differential error signal from the solar sensor, and Channel 3\nthe pulsing or command to the electric motor which is generated by a timing\npulse or by the error signal. The data for the figure were taken on May 24,\n1978 in the afternoon.\nNote the periodic error signal to the extreme left and right of the chart\non Channel 2. This corresponds to high solar intensity (see Channel 1), i.e.,\nno clouds over the Sun and the control system in the tracking mode. The area\nin between indicates mostly low solar intensity, clouds covering the Sun, which\nis recognized by the Sun Chaser and the pointing mode takes over. In the pointing\nmode, the timing pulses continue to point the sensor toward the Sun as evidenced\nby the small error signal on Channel 2.\nV1. CONCLUSION\nMuch of the world\'s atmosphere consists of combinations of clear, hazy,\nsolid cloud, and broken cloudiness with intermittent sunshine. It is desirable\nto have a solar tracker/pointing system that will always point in the direction of\nthe Sun regardless of cloud cover. The Sun Chaser accomplishes this by locking\non the Sun in clear weather, continuing to point in the Sun\'s direction based on an\ninternal timer when the Sun is obscured by clouds, and then automatically relocking on the Sun when it is visible again. The system automatically resets to the\neast at sundown to wait for the next sunrise. It is believed that the Sun Chaser\noffers the best alternative solutions to the heretofore unsolved problems of\nsolar tracking control systems, especially for those used on concentrating\ncollectors in solar heating and cooling systems.\nIn addition to its improved tracking capability, the Sun Chaser would be\nvery competitive from the standpoint of economics, size, and operation compared with presently used trackers.\n11\n\n1\t\n\nfS\n\nf\n\n\xe2\x99\xa61\n\n\\1\t\n\nW\n\nNF\n\nt\n\nr\n\nY\n\t\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 -\n\nyyj\t off\' ^\nO\n\nQ C1\n\nZ0m\nOvy\n^m0\nH\n\ni T\n\nH\nW\nZ\nW\n\nLU\t\n\nH\nZ\n\npp^ m Z W\n\nO 3 F\' W\nZUZj\n\nQ\n\n0\nN\nO\nJ\n\n\xc2\xa20\n\na.^\nti\n\n^\n\ng\n\nW\n\nT\nH\nN\nZ\nW\nH\n2\n\n~\t\nZ\nW\nW\nF\n\nQ\n\nI\nW\n\nN\n\nuj\n\nS\n\nJ\n\nY\t\n\nZ\n\nd\t\n\nS\n\nN\n\na\nT\nH\nH\n2\n\n^ W\nJ ~\nW Z\nZ\n\nN\nJ\nW\n\nZ\nZ\n\nQ\nO\ncc\nQ\nW\nJ\nZ\nW\nQ\nW\n\nLL\nQ LL\nU O\n\nO\n\n12\n\nZ\nO,\n\nr.\n\nW\n\n_\t\nU)\nW\t\n\n_ __\n\ny\n\nO.\nO\n\nWU ,\n\nZ\n\n.-\n\n...,\n\nQ j\n\nU\n\nV O\n\nO\n\nF\n_.^.___^____.\n\nr\n\nO\n\ni\n\nN,\n\nAPPROVAL\nSOLAR TRACKING CONTROL SYSTEM "SUN CHASER"\nBy D.
