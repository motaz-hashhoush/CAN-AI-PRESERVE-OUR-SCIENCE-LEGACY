However observations are the first, but far from the\nmost effective method of study. The possibility of obtaining the maximum quantitative informatio,1 and passing to construction of a mythematical model of the\nphenomenon is only provided by experiments.\n2\n\n/71\n\nThe first experiments were made with ecosystems made of microsco-)ic organisms.\nIn 1912 L. L. V udreff for the first time gave a quantitative description of the\nsuccessive change in population of Protozoa in a hzy extract under the influence of\na change in the medium of the populat1on and its organisms. He observed how\nnumerous flagellates are replaced by varying types of colpodae, and then parade.\t\n\ncia who are successively replaced by Hypotricha Irfusoria, amoebae and Vorticellae.\nA further stage in the development of this type of experiment was the study\nof closed micro-ecosystems (volume about 250 ml and more) that require for their\ndevelopment only light energy, as well as the study of the organisms developing\nin the chemostats and turbidostats of different types with controllable influx and\nefflux of nutrients. 1 A shortcoming of these systems--spatial heterogeneity of\ndifferent physical and chemical properties of the medium. This shortcoming can\nbe overcome only with the creation of basins of large capacity.\nA study of the water biocenosis in a closed basin affords the possibility of \t\ntracing the interaction between the components of the oco.3ystem under conditions\nclose to the natural, but without any external interferences.\nIn the Moscow University in a special basin of the hydrophysics laboratory\nof the physic:. department the collective of authors (V. V. A lekseyev, Yu. I. Gorbatov, A. A. Georgiyev, M. Ya. Lyamin, V. N. Maksimov and V. V. Sapozhnikov) of the\nphysics, biological and geographic departments have created a unit for study of\necosyofams--the experimental ecosystem or Etekos.\nIn the formation of the structure of the aquatic ecosystem an important role\nis played by the vertical distribution of illumination intensity and temperature,\nand the intensity of turbulent exchange at different depths--factors that can be\naltered only in a basin of sufficiently large dimensions.\nThe working basin of Etokos is a reservoir of volume\n\njAx3= 36\n\nm3 . The basin\n\nitself and the air chamber above it are insulated from the environment. The water\ncan be heated from below and cooled from above, so that in the system conditions\ncan be created that are stable in time and uniform in space. However, this pattern,\nas a rule, rarely is realized in nature. It is much more interesting to have a\nmedium in which the temperature, illumination intensity, and intensity of turbu]ant exchange are altered with depth. For this the illumination intensity and\n^ I achurkin, N. N.

Air temperature in\nchamber is lower .han in upper layer of water. Due to cooling in the upper\nlayer of water convective movement begins--an isothermic layer develops (shown\nby gray color).\ntemperature are regulated with the help of a soffit made of\n\n56 fluorescent\n\nlamps\n\nof 40 w each. The light falling at an angle to the horizontal surface is created\nby lamps whose radiation spectrum can be regulated in certain limits. These\nlamps can be moved on the circumference.\nThe conditioner can maintain a certain temperature and humidity in the air\nchamber and at the same time alter the intensity of the convective exchange in\nthe water Lhat occurs with its cooling from above.\nNutrient salts can be added to the system, or by adding distilled water their\nconcer. + ration can be reduced, which is very convenient for studying the changes\nin the ecosystems that occur, for example, with eutrophication of reservoirs, i.e.,\nwith an increase in the concentration of nutrient salts in the water.\nAn important component of the unit is the original complex of measuring\napparatus.\nThe first group includes physical and chemical parameters whose measurement\nis completely automated: temporature and illumination intensity at different\ndepths, rH values and oxidation-reduction potential of the medium, concentration\nof dissolved oxygen. The measurement results are recorded by self-recorders.\n4\n\nI\n\nThe second group of parameters comprises concentrations of different biogenic elements. yn rrinciple their measurements are standard and can be automated. However, at the given stage the chemical analyses are made manually. With\nthe help of the sampler, a polyethylene Piro 0.5 cm in diameter, the samples are\ntaken from the necessary level and further are sent to the chemical laboratory.\nThe hydrochemical analyses include determination of the organic and mineral forms\nof phosphorous and nitrogen, dissolved silicic acid, dissolved amino acids, etc.\nFinally, the third group includes primarily the biological parameters--c oneentrations of different types of phyto- and zooplankton. Determination of these\nparameters is exceptionally difficult to automate. For example, the species\ncomposition of the phytoplankton can be determined only with the help of a micro- \t\n\nX73\n\nscope. However, determination of the amount of primary product or the quantity of\nnewly formed organic substance is successfully automated. To determine the primary\nproduct of photosynthesis in situ G. G. Shinkar and V. V. Saponhnikov have suggested\na special instrument--productiometer that is two glass tubes (dark and light) through\nwhich water is pumped. By knowing the concentration of oxygen at the inlet into\nthe system (0 in ) and the concentration of oxygen at the outlet from the dark (0dk\nand light tubes (O lt ) one can easily compute the complete product\n\nthe\n(01t-0dk)\'\nThe use of this instrument\n\npure product (O\nin) and the destruction\nlt -O\n(0in-0dk).\nmakes it possible to conduct continuous recording of the product of the photosynthesizing algae and evaluate the rate of the destruction processes, or the\namount of biochemical consumption of oxygen in the dark tube. By measuring at\n\nthe inlet and outlet from the productlometer not only the concentration of oxygen\nbut also phosphorous, nitrogen, a;, well as the PH of water, etc. one can evaluate \t\nthe effect of the processes of photosynthesis on the utilization and regeneration\nof the main biogenic rDmponents.\nIt is understandable that \'0\n\nand\nwill be determined by the\nit in\nin)\n(0in-0dk)\ntime of stay of the water in the tubes. In order to determine more accurately the\nmomentary value it is necessary to make this time (exposure) less. With large\nexposures we obtain the average values of the product for a long time and will\nnot know the fine structure of the oscillations of the product in time.\nA serious method problem in studying the ecosystem is the varying degree of\naccuracy of the obtained results and the varying degree of effect of the measurement process on the syste.n. The sensors for temperature measurement can be made\nso small that they permit measurement of temperature gradients in a layer of\n5\n\n/74\n\n\t\nI\n\nchlorella\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\nI,a phn ia.\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n37\n62\n30\t\n45\t\n\t\nC 20 20 25 20 25 20 25 20 25 30 20 25 30 20 25\n\nSys 1\t\n\n15\n\n3\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\n1\n\ni^\t\n\nC1,\t i\n_j\n\n75\n\n8.0\t\n\n75 8,0\n\n75\n\n80\n\n75 80\n\xe2\x80\x94_r\na\n\nI00"r\n\nIf\n100\t\n\nicj, \xc2\xb5g at/1\t\nti\n\n22,\n20\n\n\t\n\npH 7.3 73 80 75 80 7 5 8.0 7.5 8.0\n\xe2\x80\x94^\nI\na\n\np;]"120 too\t\n\n173\t\n20 25\t\n\n* 00 _ ,00\t\n\n20 25\t\nFmin\t\n\nP com\t\n\n.00 100 \t\n\n20 25\t\nI^\t\n\n200 100\t\n\n20 25\t\n\n100\t\n\n100\n\n20\n^-\n\nCourse of Ecological Experiment\nVertical distribution of temperature, pH, concentration of dissclved oxygen\nJ. Due to the fact that\nLO 1, mineral LF\t\n, and complete phosphorous Lip\t\nni?rates were in m Rie water in a surplus, their concentration during the experiment\nchanged little, and therefore they are not shown on the figure. At the initial\nmoment in time all the parameters were uniform.. On the first day of the experiment biogenic elements were added to the water (nitrate--KNO and phosphate--KHZOO\nAs a consequence of heating the reservoir in the upper layer 3of water (50 cm)\na so-callad thermocline was formed, the concentration of oxygen was reduced due\nto the reduction in its solubility with a rise in temperature; the nH rose since\nthe content of carbon dioxide in the water was reduced.\nIn two weeks algae (chlorella) were added to the basin: intensive production of O 2 by the algae began.\nIn 1.5 months ; ,aphnia were added to the system; they feed on chlorella. This\nled to a reduction in oxygen production, decrease in the pH maximum and gradual\nstabilization of the system.\nwater less than a millimater thick (for example, with their help one can find\na cold film on the surface induced by water evaporation). The oxygen sensors\nthat are a galvaniz3d call made of two electrodes (silver --cath)de and lead-anode) immersed in a solution of alkali cannot be made small enough. In addition,\nthe oxygen near the sensor is rapidly consumed, and its constant influx is needed,\ntherefore it is necessary to install the sensors on mobile noles. Thus, the\n\n6\n\n\t\n\nOt"\' A\'3 .\nt . ,\n\nPole with Thermal Sensors to Measure Temperature at Different Depths\narea of disturbances created by the oxygen sensor is great as compared to the\narea of disturbances created by the temperature sensor. Although our sampler\nis significantly better than a bathometer, it also introduces strong disturbances\nsince during the taking of samples 500-800 ml of water are suctioned off.\nThe ecological experiment we described lasted about a year. The lamps\nwere turned on for the entire experiment. This made it possible to simplify\nthe interpretation of the findings, since the question of diurnal changes in \t\nthe parameters was removed.\n\nI.\t\n\nIn the beginning of the experiment all the indices were uniform regardless\nof depth. The water was supersaturated with oxygen, its concentration rezchod\n120% of the equilibrium value, with a temperature of 20 0 it was 11 mg/l. Nitrate\n(KNO 3) and potassium phosphate (KH 2PO4 ) wore added to the water. Heating by the\n;amps of the surface layer led fairly ra p idly to formation of a stable stratification with respect to the vertical. The concentration of oxygen in the upper\n7\n\n/75\n\nlayer was reduced due to the fact that the solubility of the molecular oxygen\ndrops with an increase in temperature.\nRoughly in two weeks in the basin algae were added (chlorella). In a week after\nthe entrance of the algae due to intensive photosynthesis at a death of 40 cm the\nmaximum content of oxygen was observed (up to 222%). The maximum pH (8.4) was\nlocated somewhat higher, at a depth of 20 cm. Evidently, this is a result of two\nprocesses: impoverishment of the upper layer of CO\n\ndue to reduction in its solu2\nbility with an increase in temperature and utilization cS CO 2 in the process of\nphotosynthesis. In nature, (for example, in the Mozhayskiy reservoir) the surface\nlayer to a depth of 1-2 m is usually mixed, and there the maximums of oxygen and\npH coincide with depth.\nIn 1.5 months after the start of the experiment Daphnia were placed into the\nbasin; they feed on chlorella. The balance between the production cf oxygen by\nphotosynthesis and the consumption of oxygen for respiration of the Laphnia and\noxidation of the organic substance was disrupted. The oxygen concentration in the\nupper layer beKEM to drop drastically, and in 20 days oxygen surersaturation was no\nlonger observed. The concentration of oxygen in the upper meter layer was just below\n100%, which indicated the dominant role of the zooplankton.\nIn the last phase of the experiment such a production-destruction equilibrium\nwas formed where an insignificant quantity of oxygen released during photosynthesis\nwas immediately consumed for respiration and oxidation of organic residues falling\nout of all links in the food chain (bacteria, phyto- and zooplankton). Impoverishment was noted of the surface layer (0-60 cm) of all forms of nitrogen: there was\na sharp reduction in the concentration of nitrates, nitrites appeared whose concentration was increased depending on depth.\nThus, the processes occurring in the basin simulated well the analogous processes\nin natural reservoirs. The studies conducted in the basin indicated the great\npotentialities of the Etokos unit: the experiment can be re \xc2\xad,eated, the conditions\ncan be controlled, the measurements can be made in considerable more detail than\nin nature. In developing these studies one can obtain the necessary coefficients\nfor compilation of a mathematical model of water biocenosis. Construction of such\na model will permit control of the hydrochemical and hydrobiological pattern of\nreservoirs, and consequently, control and prediction of the water quality. This\nsystem can be useful for working out and comparing different types of techniques\n8\n\ns\t\n\n^^\nN\n\n\'\n\nMobile Probe for Measuring Temperature, pH and 02\nproposed for monitoring the environment. Knowledge of the details of the production-destruction process is necessary in controlling synthesis of organi-:\nsubstances in the photosynthetic layer in order to more efficiently use solar\nenergy. Acceleration of the turnovor of organic substance in such an ortimized\necosystem (due to reduction in the number of trophic le 3els) will make it\npossible to accumulate a considerable quantity of organic carbon in the bottom\ndeposits. Thus, one can obtain a biochemical energy source in which the aprropriate bottom microorganisms will break down the organic substance into methane\nand CO 2\' As a result solar energy is transformed into a convenient fuel--metharo.\nNature provides us with finished samples of such a fuel element--this is lolease\nof methane from the bottom silts of eutrophic reservoirs and stagnant reservoirs.\nThe deep-water lake Kivu in Central Africa is already being used as a source of\ngas. Its water contains 60 billion m 3 of methane in the dissolved form.\n\nRecommended Literature\nAlekseyov, V. V. Ch elove k -1 b1QSLer_ L "Man and the Biosphore"], Moscow, 1973.\nTerskov, I.
