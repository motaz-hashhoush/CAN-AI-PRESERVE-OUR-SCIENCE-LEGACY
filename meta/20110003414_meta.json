Results from both the SLSD open innovation pilot program and the open innovation workshop conducted by the NASA Human Health and Performance Center will be discussed. NHHPC members will be recruited to participate in the business cluster (see membership http://nhhpc.nasa.gov) and as IAF members. Crowdsourcing may be defined as the act of outsourcing tasks that are traditionally performed by an employee or contractor to an undefined, generally large group of people or community (a crowd) in the form of an open call. The open call may be issued by the organization wishing to find a solution to a particular problem or complete a task, or by an open innovation service provider on behalf of that organization. In 2008, the SLSD, with the support of Wyle, established and implemented pilot projects in open innovation (crowdsourcing) to determine if these new internet-based platforms could indeed find solutions to difficult technical challenges. These unsolved technical problems were converted to problem statements, called Challenges by some open innovation service providers, and were then posted externally to seek solutions to these problems. In addition, an open call was issued internally to NASA employees Agency wide (11 Field Centers and NASA HQ) using an open innovation service provider crowdsourcing platform to post NASA challenges from each Center for the others to propose solutions). From 2008 to 2010, the SLSD issued 34 challenges, 14 externally and 20 internally. The 14 external problems or challenges were posted through three different vendors: InnoCentive, yet2.com and TopCoder. The 20 internal challenges were conducted using the InnoCentive crowdsourcing platform designed for use internal to an organization and customized for NASA use, and promoted as NASA@Work. The results were significant. Of the seven InnoCentive external challenges, two full and five partial awards were made in complex technical areas such as predicting solar flares and long-duration food packaging.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "South Africa", "submissionId": 20110003414, "endDate": "2011-10-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "62nd International Astronautical Congress (IAC)", "location": "Cape Town", "id": "f18c403d99764725bc9827c556469751", "startDate": "2011-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110003414, "id": "4dcaf93d63b94bd2803fd18de522a84b", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110003414.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110003414/downloads/20110003414.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110003414/downloads/20110003414.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110003414/downloads/20110003414.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
