This five-kilowatt solar-array site\n(see Figure 1) is a technology-transfer\nand commercialization success for\nNASA. Among the solar cells at this site\nare cells of a type that was developed in\nDryden Flight Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor\nTechnology (ERAST) program for use\nin NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Helios solar-powered airplane. This cell type, now denoted as A300, has since been transferred to SunPower Corporation of Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia, enabling mass production of\nthe cells for the commercial market.\nHigh efficiency separates these advanced cells from typical previously commercially available solar cells: Whereas typical previously commercially available cells\nare 12 to 15 percent efficient at converting\nsunlight to electricity, these advanced cells\nexhibit efficiencies approaching 23 percent. The increase in efficiency is due\nlargely to the routing of electrical connections behind the cells (see Figure 2). This\napproach to increasing efficiency originated as a solution to the problem of maximizing the degree of utilization of the limited space available atop the wing of the\nHelios airplane. In retrospect, the solar\ncells in use at this site could be used on Helios, but the best cells otherwise commercially available could not be so used, because of their lower efficiencies.\nHistorically, solar cells have been fabricated by use of methods that are common in the semiconductor industry.\nOne of these methods includes the use\nof photolithography to define the rear\nelectrical-contact features \xe2\x80\x94 diffusions,\ncontact openings, and fingers. SunPower uses these methods to produce\nthe advanced cells. To reduce fabrication costs, SunPower continues to explore new methods to define the rear\nelectrical-contact features.\nThe equipment at the demonstration\nsite includes two fixed-angle solar arrays\nand one single-axis Sun-tracking array.\nOne of the fixed arrays contains typical\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, March 2006\n\nFigure 1.

The Sun-tracking array tilts to follow the Sun, using an\nadvanced, real-time tracking device\nrather than customary pre-programmed\n\nmechanisms. Part of the purpose served\nby the demonstration is to enable determination of any potential advantage of a\ntracking array over a fixed array. The arrays are monitored remotely on a computer that displays pertinent information\nregarding the functioning of the arrays.\n\n9\n\nNTB GPO 0306.qxp\n\n2/24/06\n\n11:15 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nThe process for production of the advanced cells is more complex than is the\nprocess for producing typical previously\ncommercially available cells. When laminated under glass in rigid framed modules, the advanced cells are robust\nenough to last outdoors for more than\n20 years. Once the cells have been installed in the modules, the protective\nglass is coated with a dirt-repellent material. The demonstration is providing the\nopportunity to verify the effectiveness of\nthe repellent, and to determine the effect, if any, of dust and dirt on the arrays.\nNASA Headquarters funded a site-feasibility study for the demonstration. The\n\nstudy was performed by the U. S. Department of Energy\xe2\x80\x99s Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in\nIdaho Falls, Idaho. The laboratory is also\nsupporting Dryden Flight Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s public-outreach planning for the\ndemonstration. Among the planned activities is the establishment of a Web site that\nwill enable the public to view real-time information on the functioning of the arrays\nat the site.\nThis project can be characterized as\npart of a full-circle process of development of technology, transfer of the technology to private industry, and return of\nthe technology to NASA (\xe2\x80\x9cspin-in\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nfrom industry to assist NASA programs.\nThis project has been part of the Innovative Technology Transfer Partnerships\neffort under NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aerospace Technology Enterprise.\nOther solar-array sites are planned for\nconstruction in Hawaii and Arizona. A\nlarger solar farm that may be constructed at Dryden Flight Research Center in the future might supply as much as\none-third of the electric power consumed by the Center.\nThis work was done by Gray Creech of Dryden Flight Research Center.

The\nessence of the modification is to provide\nfor measurement of the internal voltage\ndrop and to increase the terminal-voltage setting by the amount of the internal\nvoltage drop.\nOrdinarily, a lithium-ion battery is\ncharged at constant current until its terminal voltage attains a set value equal to\nthe nominal full-charge potential. The\nset value is chosen carefully so as not to\nexceed the lithium-plating potential, because plated lithium in metallic form\nconstitutes a hazard. When the battery is\ncharged at low temperature, the internal\nvoltage drop is considerable because the\nelectrical conductivity of the battery electrolyte is low at low temperature. Charging the battery at high current at any\ntemperature also gives rise to a high internal voltage drop. In some cases, the\ninternal voltage drop can be as high as 1\nvolt per cell. Because the voltage available for charging is less than the terminal voltage by the amount of the internal\nvoltage drop, the battery is not fully\ncharged (see figure), even when the terminal voltage reaches the set value.\nIn the modified protocol, the charging current would be periodically interrupted so that the zero-current batteryterminal voltage indicative of the state\nof charge could be measured. The terminal voltage would also be measured\nat full charging current.

The set value of terminal\nvoltage would then be increased beyond the nominal full-charge potential\nby the amount of the internal voltage\ndrop. This adjustment would be performed repeatedly, in real time, so that\nthe voltage setting would track variations in the internal voltage drop to afford full charge without risk of lithium\nplating. If the charging current and\nvoltage settings were controlled by a\ncomputer, then this method of charge\n\ncontrol could readily be implemented\nin software.\nThis work was done by Paul Timmerman\nand Ratnakumar Bugga of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
