b'Circuits Enhance Scientific Instruments and Safety Devices\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nS\n\nince its founding in 1958, NASA has pioneered the\nuse of different frequencies on the electromagnetic\nspectrum\xe2\x80\x94including X-ray, microwave, and infrared wavelengths\xe2\x80\x94to gather information about distant\ncelestial bodies. During the 1962 Mariner 2 mission,\nNASA used microwave radiometers that operated in the\nrange of 15\xe2\x80\x9323 gigahertz (GHz) to assess the surface\ntemperature of Venus and to determine the percentage of\nwater vapor in its atmosphere.\nToday, there is another area on the spectrum proving\nuniquely useful to scientists: the terahertz (THz) range,\nspanning from about 100 GHz\xe2\x80\x9310,000 GHz. (1 THz\nequals approximately 1,000 GHz.) Terahertz frequencies span the lesser-known gap on the electromagnetic\nspectrum between microwave radiation and infrared (and\nvisible) light, falling within the spectral range where most\nsimple molecules resonate. This molecular resonance\n\nmakes terahertz particularly useful for chemical spectroscopy and the remote sensing of specific molecules.\nIn the 1990s, NASA began using frequencies above\n300 GHz (more than an order of magnitude higher than\nthe instrumentation on Mariner 2) to perform spectral\nanalysis of molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres.\nInstruments using these higher frequencies have included\nthe Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Upper\nAtmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), deployed from\n1991\xe2\x80\x932001, and the Microwave Instrument for the\nRosetta Orbiter (MIRO), launched in 2004. With UARSMLS, NASA used advanced terahertz receivers to measure\nthe emission signatures from atmospheric molecules, providing researchers with valuable data about the changes\nin the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s protective ozone layer. MIRO, set to rendezvous with the comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko\nin 2014, will use terahertz instrumentation to analyze the\ncomet\xe2\x80\x99s dust and gasses.\nAlthough NASA has been a driving force behind the\ndevelopment of terahertz technology, scientific equipment for terahertz research\xe2\x80\x94including transmitters,\nreceivers, and basic test and measurement equipment\xe2\x80\x94is\nnot widely available, making scientific experiments in\nthis range between traditional electronics and quantum\nphotonics more costly and greatly limiting commercial\ndevelopment in the field. Given NASA\xe2\x80\x99s interest in studying distant bodies in space as well as in improving life on\nEarth, the Agency has collaborated with private industry\nto develop terahertz technologies.\n\nPartnership\n\nVirginia Diodes Inc. (VDI) has found commercial success\nwith its high-frequency integrated diodes, which are key\ncomponents in VDI\xe2\x80\x99s vector network analyzer (VNA) extenders.\n\n72\t\n\nPublic Safety \t\n\nIn the early 1980s, University of Virginia professor\nThomas Crowe and research scientist William Bishop\nworked with NASA to develop high-frequency diodes\nfor UARS-MLS instrumentation. In 1996, Bishop and\nCrowe founded Virginia Diodes Inc. (VDI), based in\nCharlottesville, Virginia. A few years later, the company\nbegan developing and selling terahertz components and\nsubsystems, with a mission to make the terahertz region\n\nVDI\xe2\x80\x99s VNA extenders enable engineers to create and test\nproducts in the terahertz range. Products that use terahertz\nspan a variety of areas in research, manufacturing, and\nsecurity monitoring.\n\nof the electromagnetic spectrum as useful for scientific,\nmilitary, and commercial applications as the microwave\nand infrared frequency bands have become.\nAs a subcontractor on a 1999 Phase I Small Business\nInnovation Research (SBIR) contract from the Goddard\nSpace Flight Center, VDI collaboratively developed\nthree state-of-the-art frequency multipliers with output\ncenter frequencies of 182 GHz, 250 GHz, and 384 GHz.\nBuilding on these early successes with concurrent Phase\nII SBIR contracts from Goddard and the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory in 2001, VDI developed a highly compact\n870 GHz receiver and a compact frequency tunable\nsource for frequencies at 1.5 THz.\nToday Goddard uses these VDI technologies in the\nairborne Conical Scanning Submillimeter-wave Imaging\nRadiometer to make airborne measurements of ice\ncrystals as proof of concept for the next generation of\nspaceborne instruments for Earth and space exploration.\nIn addition to its continuing collaboration with NASA\nto develop terahertz technology for current and future\nmissions, VDI has found commercial success with its\nSpinoff 2009\n\nterahertz components and testing equipment, particularly\nits integrated diode circuits, which are key components in\nVDI\xe2\x80\x99s vector network analyzer (VNA) extenders.\n\nProduct Outcome\nBecause of the unique characteristics of terahertz radiation\xe2\x80\x94such as its ability to image items hidden behind\ncommon materials (such as clothing), and to detect and\nidentify a wide range of chemicals\xe2\x80\x94there is a growing\ndemand for terahertz components for a variety of systems.\nApplications include security imaging systems to detect\nconcealed items, hazardous chemical and biologicalagents detectors, plasma diagnostic instruments, and\nindustrial process monitors. In order to create these new\nproducts, engineers need components that can operate in\nthe terahertz range, such as high-frequency mixers and\nmultipliers, amplifiers that operate in terahertz frequencies, and advanced testing equipment like VNAs.\nVDI\xe2\x80\x99s advanced integrated diode circuits have\nincreased the frequency range of VNAs (and VNA\nextenders) by an order of magnitude, from 100 GHz\nto 1,000 GHZ (1 THz). The company\xe2\x80\x99s extenders now\nexpand the range of current commercial 4-port VNAs to\nthe 780\xe2\x80\x93850 GHz range while maintaining high dynamic\nrange (80 decibels). \xe2\x80\x9cThe frequency multipliers and\nfrequency mixers are the key technology,\xe2\x80\x9d says Crowe,\nnow VDI\xe2\x80\x99s president. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have diode circuits that were\nprimarily developed under the SBIRs.\xe2\x80\x9d Crowe also states\nthat VDI\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in the VNA extender field is the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s ability \xe2\x80\x9cto make very efficient and cost effective mixers and multipliers that work all the way to 1 THz\nand beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d These VNA extenders allow engineers to\ndesign systems and make measurements that were scarcely\npossible only 5 years ago.\nWhile most customers\xe2\x80\x94including many universities\xe2\x80\x94\ncome to VDI for components for high-frequency test\nsystems, Crowe expects VDI\xe2\x80\x99s terahertz-ready VNA\nextenders and diodes will spur the development for many\nother research instruments and commercial products,\nSpinoff 2009\t\n\nNew security imaging products use the VDI diodes to detect passive terahertz waves, which can reveal images hidden behind\ncommon materials. The image on the left, returned from the security system, shows a gun hidden under the man\xe2\x80\x99s jacket.\n\nincluding security imaging systems. One security system\ncurrently using terahertz components from VDI is\nThruVision\xe2\x80\x99s T5000 Imaging System, now in use at some\ninternational airports. Because terahertz radiation is a\nshorter wavelength than radio or microwave frequencies,\na terahertz scan of a person displays hidden objects with\nhigher spatial resolution. It also can detect a greater\nvariety of materials, including metals, wood, ceramics,\nand plastics. Terahertz photons also have very low energy\nand, unlike X-rays, terahertz radiation is non-ionizing and\nnot considered to be\xc2\xa0harmful to people. In fact, terahertz\nimaging systems like the T5000 can be totally passive,\ndetecting only the terahertz energy that is naturally\nemitted by the subject.\nThese imaging systems are possible only because of\ndevelopments in terahertz components and test equipment, and Crowe expects demand to increase noticeably in\nthe coming years as VDI\xe2\x80\x99s terahertz components improve.\nVDI\xe2\x80\x99s goals include increasing the dynamic range to\ngreater than 100 decibels throughout the entire frequency\n\nrange, and extending the\nmodular systems to greater\nVDI grows\nthan 1 THz. Transmitter\n30 percent\npower will improve as more\nper year, thanks\npower inevitably becomes\navailable from broadband\nto the company\xe2\x80\x99s\namplifiers. VDI also expects\nsuccessful\ncontinued improvement of\ncommercialization\nthe multipliers, particularly\nof terahertz\nnear the band edges.\nAccording to Crowe,\nproducts developed\nVDI has grown to over 30\nunder the NASA\nfull-time employees and\ncontracts.\ncontinues to grow at 30\npercent per year, growth he\ncredits to the company\xe2\x80\x99s successful commercialization of\nterahertz products developed under the NASA contracts.\nThe company has over 200 customers in over two dozen\ncountries, including major university and government\nresearch laboratories. v\n\nPublic Safety\t\n\n73\n\n'
