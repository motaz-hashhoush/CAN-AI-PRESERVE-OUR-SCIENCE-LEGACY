INTRODUCTION\nWhile space scientists renew the hunt for a living planet,\nEarth science has launched the grandest study ever conceived of the only living planet we know, our home planet\nEarth. This study is truly one at a planetary scale involving\nprograms and people from around the world and technologies and modeling barely envisioned just 25 years ago.\nEarth startlingly differs from our solar system neighbors\nbecause of the presence and power of life, life which\ninfluences virtually every system on Earth. Biospheric\nprocesses on the land, in the coastal zone and in the open\nocean exert an influence on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s climate system and\nclimate, in turn, exerts a strong effect on the biosphere and\nhow it is structured and functions. The biosphere, and life in\ngeneral, depend to a great extent on the presence of liquid\nwater. Changes in climate as well as changes in the biosphere are beginning to affect many aspects of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nhydrologic systems, in particular the delivery of one of the\nsmallest fractions, fresh water. These interactions have a\nnew and complicating force, the transformational power of\nthe growing human population and spirit. And, ultimately,\nhow these changes influence the fate and health of the\nhuman population is itself compelling.\nTo a great extent, the space agencies have pursued\nan old and familiar object, the climate system. From the\nearliest days of space observations, Earth\xe2\x80\x99s weather and\nclimate systems have focused the attention of agencies and\nthe public. And, still today, to a large extent the central\nfocus of the space-based global science programs are\n\nconcentrated on the climate system. The focus is different in\nthe International Geosphere Biosphere Programme, a founding program of the study of global change. While climate\neffects and influences are clearly stated, there is a greater\nbalance between geospheric and biospheric concerns. One\nof the net effects is a loss of priority in the space camp for\nobservations needed for a fuller study of the biosphere.\nThis paper focuses on biosphere-climate interactions including the influences of human activities. Recognizing this is only one aspect of biospheric processes, this\nplaces an emphasis of those biogeochemical processes that\nhave a profound effect on numerous other aspects of the\nbiosphere and the services it provides, services which are\ncritical to sustaining life on Earth. And, the paper will focus\non the various scientific aspects of assessing the availability\nof fresh water, including its sensitivity to climate variance\nand land use changes. Finally, this paper hopes to emphasize\nthe potential role that greatly expanded space observations\n\nand interactive modeling can play in developing our\nunderstanding of Earth and its the living systems.\nEcological principles were laid down only a few\ndecades ago with the 1929 publication of the book by\nVernadsky.[l]. Ecology is the science of how the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nvegetation and animals assemble into organized internally\ncompeting systems interacting within environmental constraints. The co-evolution of ecosystems with the environment provides many clues to our future. Today, for the first\ntime, satellites can measure in a routine way some key properties of ecosystems. These observations are enabling the\nprediction of a number of important processes: land use,\nland cover, parts of the carbon and water budgets, and\ncarbon exchange with aquatic systems. But, the required\nsatellite observations needed is far from complete. Just to\npermit a knowledgeable analysis of how the biosphere,\nwater cycle and the climate system interact with an\nassessment of the influences of human actions demands\nmuch more than is currently planned. Further, a more robust\nsatellite program is required to address the manner in which\nthis knowledge can be used to sustain support for all of\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s living systems, including humans. The long lead\ntime for satellite programs means the low priority currently\nbeing afforded to advanced remote sensing for biospheric\nmeasurements will stretch the time needed to gain a\ncomplete global understanding of this interaction.\nWhile the biological systems of the open ocean and\nthe coastal zone are vital to understand and predict, the\navailability of fresh water is a growing international and\n\npolicy concern. As Matthews [4] articulates so clearly,\nresources will become an increasingly important part of\nfuture national security policy, with the access to and\nmaintenance of fresh water supplies one of the most urgent.\nMirroring the growth of human population and technology,\nhuman demands for fresh water for agriculture and\nhousehold uses has been growing dramatically these last 50\nyears. Climate change and global warming can alter the\npatterns of precipitation delivery, timing, state and quantity\nin ways that are likely to exacerbate fresh water supplies.\nImpoundments and diversions are a supply solution with\ntheir own consequences, including the diversion of silt away\nfrom the coastal environments as well as the total amount of\nfresh water to mix with salt water. The cleansing of water is\na function of the ecosystem in the contributing watersheds.\nThe effects of human manipulation of terrestrial ecosystems\nworldwide has impacts on fresh water quality and amount\nthat are not well understood. And, the control of fresh water\nsystems has important effects on the biological systems in\n\nwetlands, streams, lakes and rivers that depend on\nevolutionary adaptations to the characteristics of these\nsystems. Lastly, human interactions with fresh water\norganisms can have profound human health implications.\nMany vectors of infectious disease, such as malaria,\nschistosomiasis, cholera and more have a critical link to the\npatterns and condition of fresh water systems.\n\nn. CURRENT PLANS (NEXT DECADE)\nThere is quite a bit of consensus among international\nprograms on research priorities for terrestrial ecosystems,\nthe coastal zone, and the open ocean. A significant portion\nof these objectives concern the interactions of the structure\nand function of ecosystems with the climate system and\nchanges in it, and the added complications of the human\ndimensions. For example, the objectives of long-term programs of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme\n(IGBP) address this question including Global Climate and\nTerrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE), Global Environmental\nChange and Food Systems (GECaFS), and Biospheric\nAspects of the Hydrological Cycle (BAHC). Recently,\nIGBP initiated the Integrated Land Ecosystem-Atmosphere\nProcesses Study (ILEAPS) whose goals is \xe2\x80\x9cto provide\nunderstanding of how interacting physical, chemical and\nbiological processes transport and transform energy and\nmatter through the land-atmosphere interface.\xe2\x80\x9d The second\nphase of IGBP\xe2\x80\x99s Land Ocean Interactions in the Coastal\nZone (LOICZ) Program addresses five themes: (l), river\nbasins and human dimensions; (2), coastal development and\nchange: Implications for landsea use; (3), fate and transformation of materials in coastal and shelf waters; (4),\ntowards system sustainability and resource management;\nand, (9,\nvulnerability of coastal systems and human safety.\nThe IGBP maintains other studies of the ocean including the\nJoint Global Ocean Flux Study concerned with the fluxes of\nmaterials and energy between the ocean and the atmosphere.\nThe United States Global Change Research\nProgram (www. usecm.eov, Changing Ecosystems chapter),\nas well as the U.S. Climate Change Research Program\n(USCCRP), is focused on climate with substantial attention\non biosphere interactions. Under USGCRP, regarding the\nreduction of uncertainties in climate prediction, the\nsensitivity to unresolved ocean processes is of particular\nnote. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of computer resolution, none of the current\ncoupled climate models resolve the small ocean eddies (with\nhorizontal scales of tens of kilometers) that constitute the\ndominant scale of oceanic variability. These eddies are\nthought to play a substantial role in regulating oceanic heat\ntransport (via boundary currents) and heat and carbon\nstorage by regu-lating transport to deep waters. A series of\neddy-resolving global ocean sensitivity studies are required\nto assess how well the parameterization of in current climate\nmodels portray the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s sensitivity to forcing.\xe2\x80\x9d This\nplanning document says \xe2\x80\x9cclimate sensitivity is a measure of\nthe climate\xe2\x80\x99s response to a unit change in radiative forcing\ndue, for example, to changing atmospheric concentrations of\ngreenhouse gases. It accounts for a major part of the\n\nuncertainties in climate projections.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the long-term\nquestions of the USGCRP Changing Ecosystems program\nelement is \xe2\x80\x9chow do natural and human-induced changes in\nthe environment interact to affect the structure, functioning,\nand services of ecosystems at a range of spatial and\ntemporal scales, including those functions that can in turn\ninfluence regional and global climate.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe National Science Foundation of the U.S. has a\nresearch program originally called the Freshwater Initiative\nto initiate research on many aspects of fresh water hydrology, watershed health, and freshwater ecology. The\nUSGCRP Global Water Cycle Program Element lists these\nfocus areas: (1) the effects of large-scale changes in land use\nand climate on the capacity of societies to provide adequate\nsupplies of clean water; and, ( 2 ) how natural processes and\nhuman activities influence the distribution and quality of\nwater within the Earth system and to what extent the resultant changes are predictable. The USCCRP reiterates these,\nadding concern about the movement of sediments, biogeochemical and toxic subtances, and nutrient transport. These\nprograms stress the need for research to inform policy\ndebates and enter decision processes for water management.\nIGBP recently completed the Biospheric Aspects\nof the Hydrologic Cycle, integrating parts into the ILEAPS\nand Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)\nof the World Climate Research Program. Much of the\nresearch was concentrated on the water balance and role of\nvegetation in regulating that balance.\nThe European community, while largely in agreement with the biosphere-climate interactions as discussed in\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s 2030 vision, has three important areas of divergence. First, what is the role of agricultural lands and not\njust semi-natural vegetation, in the study of biosphere/\nclimate interactions? Remote sensing has a role to play at\nthe scale of the field and farm where environmental changes\nin space and time are relatively small, ground data are\nplentiful and environmental understanding is already strong.\nIncreasingly, however, it is being used at the regional to\nglobal scale where environmental changes in space and time\nare relatively large, ground data are sparse and environmental understanding is non-existent to poor [3]. At the\nfield to farm scale remotely sensed data are often useful but\nat the regional to global scale they can often be the only data\nsource and so are vital. This facility to provide internally\nconsistent synoptic data at a range of scales has given agricultural remote sensing a major r61e in answering two of the\nlargest (and interlinked) questions of our time: \xe2\x80\x98How does\nour planet work?\xe2\x80\x99 (Le., how does the Earth system function,\nhow is it changing and what are the consequences for life on\nEarth? [ 5 ] ) and \xe2\x80\x98whither sustainable agriculture?\xe2\x80\x99 (Le., how\ndo we invent a future in which food security is achievable\nfor all in an environmentally stable way?[2]).\nSecond, there is an uncertainty about our ability to\nproduce a law-like Earth System Model. A vision of the\nEarth Science Enterprise is long term prediction. Such\npredictions could include the effect of climate change on\ncrop yield, insect populations and storm frequency at some\n\nplace and time in the future. Such predictions would be\nneed-driven and would necessitate a change in approach.\nWhile prediction is linked epistemologically and historically\nto science it is not essential and is just becoming a part of\nthe biologicalEarth science tradition that characterizes\nmuch agricultural/environmental research. This raises\nconceptual difficulties for formulating and promoting an\nEarth system modeling agenda. The lay/ political audience\nwho ultimately support such research do so in the hope that\npiece by piece we can understand how our planet works and\nwhen we know then we will know what it will do many\nyears hence. However, the Earth is complex, every relationship is dependent on external influences, so that longterm predictions defy testing [I]. Thus, this research may be\nunlikely to result in law-like predictions. The emphasis is\nmore likely to be on the use of model-derived estimates with\nuncertainties [8, IO] within a need-driven technological\napproach (NASA, 2002).and third, most importantly, the\nimportance of sustainable development as a political vehicle\nfor Earth observation developments is paramount.\nBoth the IGBP and the USGCRF\xe2\x80\x99 explicitly state\nthe role of space observations in achieving a global view o f\nbiosphere-climate interactions. For the United States, the\nagency charged with providing the satellite observations is\nlargely NASA. NASA is in the midst of launching the Earth\nObserving System (EOS) to provide a comprehensive data\nset of climate relevant variables. The priorities of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEarth Science Enterprise have been concentrated on climate\nchange and solid Earthhatural hazards research (NASA,\n2000). This will remain the focus for the next ten years as\nNASA works with its public and commercial partners in the\nU.S. and internationally to provide the first long term data\nbase of 24 key parameters. The program is organized to get\nanswers to questions in six specific focus areas: (a) How can\npredictions of climate variability and change be improved?\n(b) How will future changes in atmospheric composition\naffect ozone, climate, and air quality? (c) How will carbon\ncycle dynamics and terrestrial and marine ecosystems\nchange in the future? (d) How will water and energy cycle\ndynamics change in the future? (e) How can weather\nforecast duration and reliability be improved? and (0How\ncan our knowledge of Earth surface change be used to\npredict and mitigate natural hazards?\n\nHI. NEAR TERM SCIENCE PROGRAMS\nTerrestrial and Marine Ecosystems:\nThe ten year U.S. research program in ecosystems stresses\nthe carbon exchange dynamics of North America\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial ecosystems and the open ocean. While NASA\xe2\x80\x99s biosphere programs are linked with those of the National\nScience Foundation and other U.S. agencies. The recent\nNASA program has made substantial progress. A long-term\nobservational program has been developed to generate\n\xe2\x80\x9cclimate quality\xe2\x80\x9d information on ecosystems, primary productivity, and carbon properties (e.g., ocean color, veg index\nand land cover). Various satellite data driven analyses of the\nmajor seasonal and interannual variations in terrestrial\n\nproductivity have shown a world-wide trend of increasing\nlength of growing season\xe2\x80\x99 above 40 degrees N lat. A global\nLandsat data base for quantitative assessment of land cover\nhas been created. Models of ecological and bio-geochemical\ncycling have been established that use remote-ly sensed\nparameters. A fire occurrence product is posted daily from\nTerra MODIS data. Global ocean chlorophyll and sea\nsurface temperature are being assembled from two satellites,\nSeaWiFS and Terra MODIS. These data are being used in\nmodels of open ocean carbon exchange.\nOver the next ten years, emphasis will shift to\nquantifying the seasonal and interannual variations in the\nstate of carbon sources and sinks including the coastal ocean\nand the Southern Ocean. A new satellite, the Orbital Carbon\nObservatory, will be launched to measure atmospheric\nprofiles of C 0 2 as a constraint on carbon budgets. Carbon\nassimilation models will be expanded to incorporate new\nunderstanding of tropical ecosystems and to couple models\nwith ocean and atmospheric processes (teleconnec-tions).\nThe remote sensing of ecosystems will focus on\nidentification and characterization of plant species\nfunctional groups and physiological state for the land, algal\nblooms and carbon sequestration for marine ecosystems,\nand forecasts of how ecosystems will respond to multiple\nstressors. And, repeated Landsat inventories will help to\ndetermine the trends in land use change, its causes and the\ntrajectories of response, and the consequences for carbon\nstorage and sequestration. Much of this work is aimed at\nproviding scientifically sound information for policy setting\nand for decision support systems to implement policy and\nother landlocean management objectives.\nFreshwater systems:\nWhile one of the focus areas of the NASA program is the\nwater cycle, the ultimate aim of this research is not to\ndetermine the regional distribution of fresh water\navailability. Instead it focuses on the role of water and\nenergy in the global climate system with aims to improve\nthe prediction and measurement of precipitation,\nevaporation rates and so forth. A few groups have used\ndigital terrain model data to assemble systems to map\nhydrologic patterns down to small watersheds. The\nprediction of water yield from vegetated watersheds has\nbeen successful from small catchments to very large river\nsystems. In general, the uses of remote sensing to\ncharacterize fresh water yield and quality, to forecast\ndrought or flooding, to assess effects of changes in water\nflow volumes on fisheries and other aquatic systems is still\nlargely undeveloped.\nIV. A DECADAL VIEW\nLooking out to 2030, will the present suite of satellite\nsensors and research foci be sufficient to answer the\nquestions of how the biosphere and the climate system\ninteract, what the availability of fresh water will be, and\nwhat the influences will be from human actions? Probably\nnot. By early in the next decade, the science understanding\nof the carbon cycle will be greatly improved but it will still\n\nadapted ecosystems. Hillslopes denuded of vegetation have\ndramatically reduced capability to absorb rainfall, so that\nlarge mass flows can follow fires, clogging reservoirs and\nrivers, and reducing water quality. Current sensors are\nincapable of measuring the most important properties of\nfire, those with predictive power, even though these sensors\ncan provide a rough estimate of fire occurrence.\nThe coastal zone has been largely neglected in\nsatellite planning. Sensors optimized for the open ocean\nhave limited utility in the shallower and often turbid waters\nof the coastal zone, a marine system closely coupled to the\nland. These two ecological domains do share some common\nunmet measurement needs, namely, mixed layer depth,\nnutrient fields, salinity, and physiolog-ical state. Though a\nnumber of organizations have stated their intention to\nlaunch satellites to monitor the coastal zone, as of 2003,\nnone have succeeded (Peterson et al., 2003).\nThe new or additional measurement requirements\nfor the biosphere are listed in table 1. Though there is\ndiscussion of some of the space technology to make these\nmeasurements and even some low Technology Readiness\nLevel space experiments (notably, the Hyperion\nhyperspectral imaging spectrometer on EO-1); NASA does\nnot have a coherent plan to accomplish the difficult suite of\nmeasurements described. Commercial companies are now\nproviding some high spatial resolution observations. And,\nmost of these measurements have been demonstrated from\nairborne platforms, though even those rarely are optimized\nfor specific biological phenomena.\n\nlack critical measurements. Certainly net primary production will be further along, but probably not, net ecosystem\nproduction in which there is an explicit estimation of belowground respiration and maybe not, maintenance respiration.\nThere will be an enhanced global understanding of COz and\nwater vapor exchange and (2% production and consumption; but not other important trace gases: N20, NO, CO,\nNMHC, VOCs, and NH3.What biogeochemical processes\nregulate these fluxes? Are these processes measurable by\nremote sensing and how much do human actions affect\nthem? And, some progress can be expected on estimating\nprecipitation and some components of the water cycle.\nOne of the most evident effects of human activity\nis the transformation of the landscape into uses almost\nexclusively for the benefit of humankind. At present we can\nlay down an historical record of land cover and try to infer\nland use. But we are not well prepared to predict the course\nof ecosystem restoration or the trajectory of response, nor\nthe possibilities that an ecosystem will enter a new and\nstable state resistant to restoration. And, what will be the\nconsequences of these changed landscapes and the\necosystem services they are supposed to provide for the\ngeneration of fresh water supplies?\nAnother event as old as the ages is fire, a force now\ndominated by humans today with tremendous transformation power. Fires produce substantial though poorly understood fluxes of gases and particulates into the troposphere;\nand can lead to permanent change in ecosystem structure\nand function. It is also an agent for beneficial change in fireTab1\n\nMeasurements\n\nFrequency\n\nTechnology Needs\n\nMixed layer depth, wind fields, salinity\n\nDaily\n\nNutrient fields (N, Si, Fe), aerosol deposition,\nhnctional groups\n\nWeekly\n\nActive sensors image through\nclouds, lidar sensors\nPassive sensors\n\nOCEANS\n\nCOASTAL ZONE\n\nColored dissolved organic matter; Chlorophyll and\nother pigments; Functional groups; Bathymetry\nand bottom reflectance; Nutrient concentration (N,\nSi, Fe, P)\nPhysiological state (fluorescence)\n\nignm, pigmen\n\nDaily-Weekly\n\nHyperspectral (350-900nm) (also:\nradiometry)\n\nDaily\n\nSpace-based passive fluorometer\nOr excitement/emission fluorometer\n\nJ\n\n.\nmost challenging will be soil moisture, how to assess soil\nmoisture on a continuous basis down to the rooting depth of\nmost plants, about one meter. The only plans going forward\ntoday are a combination of in situ sampling and remote\nsensing for some form of extrapolation.\n\nTable 2 lists measurement requirements for fresh water\nassessment. Most of the required measurements are not\nplanned nor do they have priority, except those associated\nwith natural hazards (sea ice thickness, ice sheet thickness,\nsnow pack and ice sheet topographic change). One of the\nTable 2. New measurements for Fresh Water Availabilitv\n\nI Ice sheet topographic change\n\n1\n\n< I year\n\nJ 1-10 km\n\nNew Modeline Required\nGross primary production models of the open\nocean are based on absorption of photosynthetically active\nradiation in the photic zone and on the sea surface\ntemperature. The future models will include functional\ngroups with different rates of efficiency, mixed layer depth,\nnutrient fields (N, Si, Fe), and aerosol deposition. Carbon\nsequestration to the deep ocean is based on knowledge of\nocean heat transport and circulation patterns. Future\nmodeling capabilities must integrate mixed layer depth to\nelucidate the trophic levels of fish and microbiotic species.\nOnce in the coastal zone, the spatial resolution of many\nprocesses decreases. This zone is subject to episodic\ndischarge events from the land, which can change the color\nof the waters and their clarity. Models will be needed of\nnutrient redistribution and hypersaline flows. Improvements\nin bio-optical and radiation transport must be improved,\nconsidering the possibility of bottom reflectance signals,\nCase 2 waters, and riverine inputs.\nEcopyhysiological models of terrestrial ecosystems\nare improving, on track to predict net primary production\nand related indices of carbon exchange based on remotely\nsensed variables. These models are based on short-term\nprocesses and while they are being used to predict the\nproduction of a host of biogenic gases to and from the\n\nI\n\n1 cm height\n\natmosphere, they are now based too heavily on correlates to\nNPP. Modeling of life cycle community structure, based on\nremote sensing data, is less well developed and eventually\nmust be coupled with the ecophysiological models. Future\ncommunity models will be needed to predict the trajectories\nof ecosystem response to change, including climatic, land\nuse, multiple stressors, species invasions and so forth.\nRadiative transfer models must be improved to enable\nforward prediction of ecosystem variables from the remote\nsensing signals. Such models are needed for not only the\nproperties of intact and healthy ecosystems, but for all of the\naltered and disturbed states caused by natural and human\ninduced causes including fire behavior. As these models\nmature and are tested against calibrated data, the models\nshould allow researchers to better assess the consequences\nof human interactions: fires, land conversions, grazing,\nover-utilization, soil degradation, selective and complete\nharvesting, acidic precipitation, as well as climate variation.\nIn the end, once such models are integrated with other\ncomponents of the Earth system model and further\nintelligence is added on ecosystem services, the modeling\nsuite might be ready to address, in conjunction with the\ngreatly enlarged satellite data set, to address numerous\npractical questions in the terrestrial biosphere.\n\nTable 3.

The former is strongly concentrated\non climate change and natural hazards for NASA, while the\nlatter has a greater emphasis on all of the aspects of the\ninfluence of the living systems on the Earth system. Since\nsatellite programs are generally long lead time programs and\ncostly, it could be some time before this apparent imbalance\nmight be rectified. The study of a living planet at such a\nplanetary scale must give due attention to the living part to\nmake up a legitimate and accurate picture of how the system\nfunctions and will evolve into a future dominated by human\ninfluences. This paper attempts to illustrate some measurement steps and modeling improvements that might move us\ntoward this more complete picture. And, hopefully, provide\nthe kinds of data and models that will allow us to respond to\nthe changes that are sure to come in the near future.\nReferences: [ 11 Byerly Jr, R.
