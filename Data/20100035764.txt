From sphygmograms produced by conventional sphygmographs,\nit is very difficult to differentiate the systolic and\ndiastolic blood-pressure pulses and to correlate these\nindices with the standard clinical values. It is nearly\nimpossible to determine these indices when the subject\nis under physical or emotional stress.\nThe solution: An electronic blood-pressure system,\nbasically similar to conventional ausculatory sphygmomanometers, employing a standard occluding cuff,\na gas-pressure source, and a gas-pressure regulator\nand valve. An electrical output transducer senses\n\ncuff pressure, and a microphone positioned on the\nbrachial artery under the occluding cuff monitors the\nKorotkoff sounds from this artery. The output signals\npresent the conventional systolic and diastolic indices\nin a clear, graphical display. The completesystem also\nincludes an electronic timer and cycle-control circuit.\nHow it's done: The output of the microphone is\nfed through a solid-state amplifier and a 35-cps filter\ninto the mixing circuitry where it is superimposed on\nthe signal from the pressure transducer. The output of\nthe mixing circuitry is fed to a continuous chart recorder which gives a plot of cuff pressure versus time.\nThe first signal pulse appearing on the graph as the\ncuff pressure is slowly reduced indicates the systolic\npressure and the last pulse corresponds to the diastolic\npressure.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nNow\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nNotes\nThe occluding cuff must be of a minimum width in\norder to ensure correlation of the measured systolic and diastolic values with the accepted indices.\nA narrow cuff is highly desirable for comfort and\nmobility of the subject.\nOver 2,000 blood pressure measurements have\nbeen taken using this system on various individuals,\nand many of the readings have been compared\nwith those taken with a conventional sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. In only a few instances were the readings off by more than a few\nmillimeters of mercury.\nA small amount of additional development would\nbe required to make the system completely automatic. Such a system should be of considerable\nvalue for monitoring the blood pressure of hospitalized patients and as a clinical diagnostic aid.\n\nBrief 65-10365\t\n\n4.
