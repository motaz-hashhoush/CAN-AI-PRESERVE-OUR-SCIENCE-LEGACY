Its mission was to collect solar wind samples and return those samples to Earth for detailed analysis by  scientists. The mission proceeded successfully for three-and-a-half years. On September 8, 2004, the spacecraft approached Earth, pointed the Sample Return Capsule (SRC) at its entry  target, and then fired pyros that jettisoned the SRC. The SRC carried the valuable samples collected over the prior 29 months. The SRC also contained the requisite hardware (mechanisms,  parachutes, and electronics) to manage the process of entry, descent, and landing (EDL). After entering Earthas atmosphere, the SRC was expected to open a drogue parachute. This  should have been followed by a pyro event to release the drogue chute, and then by a pyro event to deploy the main parachute at an approximate elevation of 6.7 kilometers. As the SRC  descended to the Utah landing site, helicopters were in position to capture the SRC before the capsule touched down. On September 8, 2004, observers of the SRCas triumphant return  became concerned as the NASA announcer fell silent, and then became even more alarmed as they watched the spacecraft tumble as it streaked across the sky. Long-distance cameras clearly  showed that the drogue parachute had not deployed properly. On September 9, 2004, General Eugene Tattini, Deputy Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory formed a Failure Review Board  (FRB). This board was charged with investigating the cause of the Genesis mishap in close concert with the NASA Mishap Investigation Board (MIB). The JPL-FRB was populated with experts  from within and external to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The JPL-FRB participated with the NASA-MIB through all phases of the investigation, working jointly and concurrently as one  team to discover the facts of the mishap.", "title": "Genesis failure investigation report : JPL Failure Review Board, Avionics Sub-Team", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Klein, John"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "7d20f20dc8c045ad94ad66df438d2b58"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Manning, Rob"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "77fbec7597664601b29d654ce03770cd"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barry, Ed"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "c821bb6ca29b44d68de92e9938af287d"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Donaldson, Jim"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "c349a363c5d446c6a45e64abdd7c19b3"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rivellini, Tom"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "76c7b986c8a04b86b24fea479a8d1273"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Battel, Steven"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "6f0a2f83e09b42039411cabf5ca1dbfa"}, {"sequence": 6, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Savino, Joe"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "475f0d2eeb2e407988f01545b4f9bb8b"}, {"sequence": 7, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lee, Wayne"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f9a055e2531446f88bc383d2ba176754"}, {"sequence": 8, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dalton, Jerry"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "66505635f5c743d99d2838818fad86c5"}, {"sequence": 9, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Underwood, Mark"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "94fd2fccd916411ab8c73ee36c549191"}, {"sequence": 10, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Surampudi, Rao"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "69c6c4507ccb4f478ea4d99f452b9d5f"}, {"sequence": 11, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Accord, Arden"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "e26af49236684f6580ddabedcb320873"}, {"sequence": 12, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Perkins, Dave"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "1ad633cf7f28450f986b3e5ba62d4aa3"}, {"sequence": 13, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Barrow, Kirk"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "1df0328156904902912fdef9a804e306"}, {"sequence": 14, "submissionId": 20060043654, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilson, Bob"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "82f91d5dff5d4169849dabe17a64ee02"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060043654, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/38719", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060043654, "id": "3f2cd36d89a34948b08db911fa5430cf", "publicationDate": "2004-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
