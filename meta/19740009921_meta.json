It has become increasingly important to bridge this widening gap between remote sensing specialists and potential users. Members of the University of California project on remote sensing of earth resources have been actively participating in efforts to overcome this gap by maintaining library facilities, disseminating research findings, training remote sensing specialists, and interacting with resource managers.", "title": "Interchance and cooperation with user agencies", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T19:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740009921, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lauer, D.
