The instrument SpaceWire interface is implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array as an instantiated core controlled by a LEON3FT CPU, which is also implemented as an instantiated core.  The UT699 processor in the flight computer provides the spacecraft side\u2019s SpaceWire interface.  \r\nA simple message based protocol consisting of four message types was defined, based on existing SpaceWire standards.  One was for passing commands to and responses from the instrument in the form of text strings similar to those from a system console where each line of text is passed in a SpaceWire message.  Another was for passing spacecraft time to the instrument. The third was for transferring files using a subset of the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP).  The fourth was for retrieving science data from the instrument. A set of user application programming interface (API) routines provided an abstracted interface to both the serial console (used during debug) and the SpaceWire device interface.  Early instrument development and testing was done with a set of utilities that controlled a Star-Dundee USB-SpaceWire brick providing a user interface similar to a serial console terminal emulator with the addition of file and data transfers.  Later in the integration and test process, these utilities were integrated with the COSMOS ground systems software used for spacecraft control, providing a seamless transition from standalone instrument tests to benchtop flat-sat test and full spacecraft level tests.", "title": "SpaceWire as a Cube-Sat Instrument Interface", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008307, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lux, James P."}}, "id": "5082801070714fd5bdd75b3aa8ad4ad5"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008307, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Starch, Michael D."}}, "id": "f29926f76b1f46258706e2f96d758ba7"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008307, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Yarlagadda, Anusha"}}, "id": "fecfb0f2fb564729b846ee29fedc9c64"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008307, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chase, Matthew D."}}, "id": "57469627e7e04fe7a88cf672936fbed3"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008307, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Clancy, Susan C."}}, "id": "6e795aa27eef43be83f2ce78c2e4e8e6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:19:56.6976420+00:00", "id": 20210008307, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/48132", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210008307, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "52db4cf216c84541b6e0f3d95ba74392", "publicationDate": "2018-05-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
