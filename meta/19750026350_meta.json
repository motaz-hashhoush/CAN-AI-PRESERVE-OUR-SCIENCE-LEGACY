One of the main objectives of the Skylab Program, with its missions of  28, 59, and 85 day duration concerned biomedical investigations of various types, and large amounts of relevant experimental data have been gathered and are in the process of being sorted and interpreted. In order to be of eventual usefulness in forming and testing consistent physiological hypotheses concerning the effect of zero gravity on man, a modeling effort was established in 1972 through the General Electric Company, Space Division, Houston, Texas. An account is given of  some of the developments completed or in progress as part of this modeling effort. A long-term cardiovascular model and a large model of the systemic circulation are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19750026350, "endDate": "1974-07-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Summer Computer Simulation Conference", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "83ffc50eba16464d97b14d2442d6fa7b", "startDate": "1974-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750026350, "id": "142b110fc5f14deea28bc1b5dd672d95", "publicationDate": "1974-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
