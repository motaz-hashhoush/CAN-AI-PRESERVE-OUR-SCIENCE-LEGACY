The\nvapor is then routed through tubing and custom valves\nto control mass flow to the thruster and cathode assembly.2 The thruster then ionizes the vapor and accelerates it via magnetic and electrostatic fields, resulting in\nthrust with a specific impulse >1,300 s.\nThe iSAT spacecraft, illustrated in figure 1, is currently a 12U CubeSat. The spacecraft chassis will be\nconstructed from aluminum with a finish to prevent\niodine-driven corrosion. The iSAT spacecraft includes\nfull three-axis control using wheels, magnetic torque\nrods, inertial management unit, and a suite of sensors\nand optics. The spacecraft will leverage heat generated\nby spacecraft components and radiators for a passive\nthermal control system.\n\nThis project is a collaborative effort to mature an iodine\npropulsion system while reducing risk and increasing\nfidelity of a technology demonstration mission concept.1 The FY 2014 tasks include investments leveraged\nthroughout NASA, from multiple mission directorates,\nas a partnership with NASA Glenn Research Center\n(GRC), a NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC)\nTechnology Investment Project, and an Air Force\npartnership.\nPropulsion technology is often a critical enabling technology for space missions. NASA is investing in technologies to enable high value missions with very small\nand low-cost spacecraft, even CubeSats. However,\nthese small spacecraft currently lack any appreciable\npropulsion capability. CubeSats are typically deployed\nand drift without any ability to transfer to higher value\norbits, perform orbit maintenance, or deorbit. However,\nthe iodine Hall system can allow the spacecraft to transfer into a higher value science orbit. The iodine satellite\n(iSAT) will be able to achieve a \xce\x94V of >500 m/s with\n<1\xc2\xa0kg of solid iodine propellant, which can be stored in\nan unpressurized benign state prior to launch.\nThe iSAT propulsion system consists of the 200 W Hall\nthruster, solid iodine propellant tank, a power processing unit, and the necessary valves and tubing to route\nthe iodine vapor. The propulsion system is led by GRC,\nwith critical hardware provided by the Busek Co.\n\n162\n\nFigure 1: Preliminary FY 2014 12U concept design.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\nThe benefits of the iodine Hall technology and iSAT\ndemonstration include enabling significant small spacecraft maneuverability with a propulsion system viable\nwith secondary payload launch opportunities.3 Most of\nthe technology benefits are derived from the unpressurized storage, low pressure operation, and high density.\nThe storage and operating pressures allow for additive\nmanufacturing of the propellant tank and shapes to\nmaximum volume. Also, the iodine density components\nwith the Hall thrusters results in more than an order of\n\nC\n\nD\n\nB\n\nE\n\nA\nF\n\nFigure 2: Custom control electronics (A), propellant reservoir (B), VACCO iodine valve (C), integrated test plate (D), Busek\nBHT-200-I thrusters (E), and Colorado State University electride cathode (F) on the MSFC pendulum thrust stand B4205 R101.\n\nmagnitude improvement in \xe2\x88\x86V per unit volume of small\nsat state of the art.\n\nPotential Applications\n\n1.\t Dankanich, J.W.; Polzin, K.A.; Calvert, D.; and\nKamhawi, H.: \xe2\x80\x9cThe iodine Satellite (iSAT) Hall\nThruster Demonstration Mission Concept and\nDevelopment,\xe2\x80\x9d 50th Joint Propulsion Conference,\nCleveland, OH, July 28\xe2\x80\x9330, 2014.\n2.\t Dankanich, J.W.; Szabo, J.; Pote, B.; et al.: \xe2\x80\x9cMission and System Advantages of Iodine Hall Thrusters,\xe2\x80\x9d 50th Joint Propulsion Conference, Cleveland,\nOH, July 28\xe2\x80\x9330, 2014.\n3.\t Polzin, K.A.; and Peeples, S.: \xe2\x80\x9cIodine Hall Thruster\nPropellant Feed System for a CubeSat,\xe2\x80\x9d 50th\nJoint Propulsion Conference, Cleveland, OH,\nJuly 28\xe2\x80\x9330, 2014.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\nThis project was approved under the Small Spacecraft\nTechnology Program for a technology demonstration\nmission in early FY 2017.\n\n163\n\nCSDSG\n\nThe primary applications are geocentric maneuverability and interplanetary transit for small spacecraft.\nThe technology enables cost-effective geocentric constellation deployment, orbit maintenance, and deorbit. The technology can also enable EELV Secondary\nPayload Adapter class small sats to depart from geosynchronous transfer orbit and go to the Moon, asteroids, Mars, and Venus, saving potentially upwards of\n$100M in launch costs to interplanetary destinations.\nHigher power systems can also be used for orbit transfer vehicles and eventually have potential for human\nexploration activities with ground test and propellant\npackaging advantages.\n\nReferences\t\n\n'
