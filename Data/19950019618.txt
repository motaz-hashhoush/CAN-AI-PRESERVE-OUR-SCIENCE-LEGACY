In one embodiment, where the input impedance\nis reduced in essence, to solely a capacitive reactance,\nan operational amplifier in a follower configuration is\ndriven at its non-inverting input and a resistor with a\npredetermined magnitude is connected between the\ninverting and non-inverting inputs. A second embodiment eliminates the capacitance from the input by adding a second stage to the first embodiment. The second\nstage is a second operational amplifier in a non-inverting gain-stage configuration where the output of the\nfirst follower stage drives the non-inverting input of the\nsecond stage and the output of the second stage is fed\nback to the non-inverting input of the first stage\nthrough a capacitor of a predetermined magnitude.\nThese amplifiers, while generally useful, are very useful\nas sensor buffer amplifiers that may eliminate significant\nsources of error.\n\n13 Claims, 1 Drawing Sheet\n\n1\n0\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n5,399,993\n\nMar. 21, 1995\n\nFIG. 1\nPRIOR ART\n\nFIG. 2\n\nFIG. 3\n\n1\n0\n/\n\n20\nI\nL\n\n1\n\n5,399,993\n\n2\n\npre-amplifier, if the pre-amplifier input impedance is\nHIGH INPUT IMPEDANCE AMPLIFIER\nmade very large.
