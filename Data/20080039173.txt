Smith*"\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\nThis paper presents the best practices used by several commercial\nand government operators of satellite constellations. These best\npractices were identified through a series of seminars and discussions\nheld at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The best\npractices are arrived through many years of experience and\nimprovements made in the operations procedures and the operational\nsystems with the primary drivers as mission safety and cost\neffectiveness. This paper discusses the operational aspects associated\nwith how different organizations manage complexities of constellation\noperations. For the purposes of this paper, satellite constellations are\ngroups of similar spacecraft with more than one spacecraft needed to\nfully accomplish the constellation\'s mission.\nIntroduction\nIn June 2005, Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. (HTSI), through the Mission\nOperations and Mission Services (MOMS) contract at the Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC) of NASA, several commercial and government satellite operators were invited to\nGSFCNASA for a series of presentations on the efficient management of large satellite\nconstellations. The primary purpose of these presentations was for GSFC personnel to\nlearn more about the challenges faced by current constellation operators, and to apply\nthese lessons learned to future missions. Many of the lessons may also apply to the\nconsolidation of existing missions into single fleet operations centers.\nThe best practices were determined based on several factors. For most part, the\nconstellation operators identified needed improvements for optimal performance. In\nsome cases, a group no longer was performing a certain function that the other groups\nwere still doing. A qualitative assessment was made to judge the value of a best practice.\nNo attempts were made to quantify the impact of the best practices identified in this\npaper.\nI.\n\n* Flight Operations Engineer, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD\n2077 11Code 420.2\nSenior Program Manager, 75 15 Mission Drive, Lanham, MD 20706\n* * Manager, Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Greenbelt, MD 20771/Code 58 1.0\n\nThe presenters covered a common set of topics with varying degrees of depth due to\ntheir respective emphasis and application on their constellations. The common set of\ntopics is summarized in section 11. Due to the proprietary nature of the commercial\nbusiness and for competitive reasons, the names of the operators are not identified.\n11.\n\nBest Practices\n\nA. Defining the Constellation\nFor this work,, the constellation is defined as a group of satellites with a common\npurpose. A minimum set of satellites were needed to fully achieve mission objectives.\nThe spacecraft are placed in particular configurations in order to accomplish the full\nmission. Whereas having spares is not critical for meeting mission objectives, they were\ndetermined to be beneficial to quickly recover from failures. For most part, the\nconstellation operators developed their own infrastructure, viz., dedicated ground\nantennas, data routing services and customer support.\nTwo types of constellations are addressed here: large number of low earth orbiting\nsatellites to cover the globe and groups of geosynchronous satellites. The historical way\nto get wide area ground coverage was the geosynchronous satellite constellations with\nhigh powered ground stations. The more recent constellations are the low earth orbiters\nwhich need more satellites to accomplish the same coverage. Each of these constellations\nhas its own benefits and challenges, and yet the operations of the two types have many\ncommonalities.\nThe following topics are explored from the commonality between different types of\nsatellite operators.\nDefining the Constellation.\nCommonalities.\nSignificant Events That Drive Changes.\nAnomaly Identification and Tracking.\nGround System Resources.\nIndividual Vehicle Identification.\nStaff Sizing.\nEquipment Sizing.\nWorkload.\nAutomation.\n\nB. Commonalities\nAll the constellations reported here had 24-hour operations. The degree of the\ncapabilities on some shifts varied, but all had at least a minimal staff 24x7. This is due to\nthe real-time nature of the mission. Each constellation\'s mission is to provide a real-time\nservice. It is imperative to correct for any outage of the service immediately due to the\nutility needed 24x7 for the constellation service objectives. Whereas other missions, such\nas the ones that NASA operates have real-time needs, the impact on the user community\nis significantly different. The utility services provided by the constellations, such as\ncommunications services and other national infrastructure needs, are critical for citizenry\nfor emergency communications or hazardous situation warnings.\n\nThe need for 24-hour operations is also a financial necessity for the business model of\nthe communications missions. Single outages result in loss of revenue. Multiple outages\ncause customer dissatisfaction and eventually loss of customers reducing customer base.\nOnce the business gets below the critical mass of customer base the ending of the mission\nbecomes an undesirable reality. The 24 hour operations staff reduces the risk for outages\nand provides the quickest response to any outages.\nIt was a deliberate strategy due to mission needs on the part of the constellation\nowners to build the constellations quickly. This strategy was enabled and implemented by\nthe capability to launch several spacecraft on a variety of launch vehicles. The use of a\nvariety of launch vehicles alleviated the risk and avoided the reliance on a single launch\nservice that may be interrupted or halted for an extended period of time due to a\nmultitude of reasons such as a problem with a particular launch vehicle or a part of its\nfacility. When there is a delay with one launch service, the constellation can still be\npopulated through the use of one of the other available choices. Some of the many\nchoices are shown in Figure 1.\nIn order to quickly populate the large constellations the spacecraft manufactures had to\ndesign satellites that fit to several different launch vehicle dispensers. They also had to\ndesign to the different launch loads and other unique features of the launch services.\nA challenge faced by the large constellation operators was to launch multiple satellites\nwith each launch. This requires many design accommodations:\nEach satellite must have a propulsion system. For many stand-alone low earth\nsatellites there is no need for a propulsion system. Often, the satellite orbit\nachieved by a launch service is sufficient for a long and productive over the life of\na mission. Having multiple satellites on a single launch, however, drives the need\nto a propulsion system in order to separate the assets to their eventual\nconfiguration.\nThe mechanical structure must stack into several different configurations. Each of\nthese constellations had a different numbers of satellites depending on the launch\nlift capabilities.\nThe design of the satellite must accommodate for last minute launch reconfiguration.\nDuring the manufacturing phase, it is not known which satellites will be launched\ntogether. Some last minute adjustments are needed to differentiate one satellite from\nanother. These include setting frequencies and loading PROMS.\n\nFigure 1. Various Launch Vehicles\nC. Significant Events That Drive Major Changes\nIt was interesting to note that several of these constellations had significant events that\ndrove dramatic changes toward cost efficiency. Even though a commercial service\nprovider has built-in incentives to be cost effective, it still took a dramatic event such as\nfinancial bankruptcy to force bigger changes. Perhaps the biggest change to come\nforward was to reduce vendor!subcontractor dependence. During bankruptcy, the\ncompany is unable to pay for the vendor!subcontractor services. So, they adapted to do\nwithout or postponed deliveries. Dependence on in-house development and sustainment\nof systems was accelerated. Only critical licenses were renewed.\nGovernmental or regulated services that are privatized also brought most of the\nsupport system development and sustainment effort in house. This resulted in cost\nefficiencies and higher reliability. License fees are a very large expense when the number\nof systems is multiplied by the number of satellites in a full constellation. Ownership of\nthe systems and software also allows the operations team to select the optimal operating\nplatform.\nThe one organization that had no change-forcing events had the highest staffing level\nto spacecraft ratio. This was true for the day time engineering staff as well as the console\noperators. They also had not automated the remote ground terminals and thus had a large\nstaff associated with each ground station.\n\nAll of the constellation missions have seen a change in efficiency when early orbit\noperations have been completed and the constellation transitions to steady state . This is\nalso valid for stand-alone spacecraft operations. The launch and checkout phase of the\nspacecraft takes a large team of engineers and operators to perform the checkout\nactivities. Once the checkout phase is complete, the mission begins to focus on the prime\nmission objectives. The effort is focused on maintaining the primary objectives and\nquickly resolving any interruptions.\n\nPrime Mission\n\nAge of the System\ncp1389001 ppt\n\nFigure 2. Change in Efficiency over Time\n\nA contributing factor in the stability of operations is the fact that the infant mortality\nphase is passed. Most launch-induced or production problems are discovered and\nremedied. Engineering flaws are also discovered early in the constellation population and\ncheckout phase. Prior to any launches, the I&T team has identified potential problems.\nThe engineers have solved the problems and tested the solutions. Procedures are in place\nand ready to be used.\n\nD. Anomaly Identification and Tracking\nThe best practice we found in the area of anomaly identification and tracking across\nall constellations was to treat each satellite of a given constellation in the same way.\nDisplay pages contain the same information each vehicle; not a different page for\neach satellite.\nSummary displays contain critical information of the whole or subset of the\nconstellation.\nOne database is established for the whole constellation with processes in place to\nhandle exceptions.\nE. Back Orbit Monitoring\nThe constellation operators deal with back orbit monitoring differently on whether\nthey can use cross links or not. For constellations with cross links capability, as in Figure\n\n3, each satellite is always accessible to the operations team. The operators can\ncontinuously scan for problems and correct situations in near real-time. Cross links\neliminate the need to review playback data for out of view spacecraft. If crosslinks are\nnot available, the plotting and analysis of back orbit data was stopped after three years for\none constellation.\nF. Ground System Resources\nI . General Network Architecture\nAll of the constellations had the standard set of hardware and functions:\nplanning,\ntrending,\nflight dynamics,\nantenna control and\ntelemetry and command.\n\nq>,\n\nCross-linked satellites\n\n(QR\n\nFieure 3. A Renresentative Cross-linked Constellation\nOne constellation organization systematically evaluated every function to automate\nand improve efficiency. It added situational awareness tools and expert systems. It\nautomated failovers. It runs most operations from the planned script. This includes\nexecuting maneuvers and ground antenna operations. Executing maneuvers and ground\nantenna operations are the last two vestiges that are performed and controlled manually\nby most teams.\n2. Command and Control\nOne constellation team stood out in the command and control system architecture.\nThis organization brought the development effort in house and started to improve and\ncustomize all the typical applications. Each function was analyzed and planned for\nupgrade.\n\n3. Health Evaluation Architectures\nAll the organizations of the larger constellations quickly evolved summary displays\nfor complete constellation health and status assessments. These typically consisted of\ncolor coded boxes arranged purposefully on a page.\nOther typical architectures include pop up message boxes for heads-up alerts.\nG. Individual Vehicle Identification\nThe best practice for vehicle ID is to have both orbital slot and vehicle serial number.\nBoth are useful for different applications. One application is for parts tracking. Just as in\nany mass produced item, it is necessary to be able to identify the lot number. These items\nare identified and tracked by ground serial number. When the satellite is being\nmanufactured, it may not be known what its orbital slot will be. Other items, such as\ncommunications outages and pass planning are best tracked by orbital identifiers.\nSome of the constellations communicated with the individual satellites through\nfrequency separation and some on spatial diversity. Others use a crosslink and are able to\ncommunicate with any satellite at any time.\n\n/\n\nTelemetry\n\n\\Commands\n\nFigure 4. Typical Architecture\n\nH. Staff Sizing\n\nWe observed a vast difference in staff sizing across different constellations. A number\nof factors influence staffing levels.\n1. Engineering Staff\nThis is driven by operations philosophy. Does the organization plan to replace the\nsatellite quickly or are they going to put every effort into maintaining each and every\nsatellite? While none of the organizations were treating the vehicles as disposable, there\nwere significant differences in the approach toward maintenance. One organization had a\ngroup of specialized engineers and the capability to modify most of the onboard software.\nAnother organization had an engineering staff mostly composed of only those people\nnecessary to perform normal operations like maneuver planning. It had little capability to\nmodify any onboard software.\nThe approach is driven by the financial pressures and bankruptcy being common in the\nmarket place, the lower cost becomes a primary driver. There was no conclusive data to\nshow that any approach influenced the spacecraft lifetime positively or negatively.\nThere is a general recognition and some of the organizations have consciously\nimplemented technology to allow reductions in staffing levels. The staffing levels can\nbe reduced further, but it is also recognized that there is a need to keep sufficient staff to\nmaintain spacecraft engineering expertise. This is a costlrisk trade that each organization\nmust balance.\n2. Console Staff\n3. It was difficult to isolate and measure the level of console staff that each organization\nwas deploying. This is due to the fact that the skill level has migrated and merged with\nthe engineering skills as the automation has been deployed to replace manual\noperations. Early operations of any system are very manual. Constellations that are\nlarge compound the workload. As a result, the console staff level is high at the\nbeginning of the constellation mission. As automation and process improvements are\nintroduced to manage routine operations, the console staff is reduced. It is not unusual\nthat with increased participation in the automation and process improvements, the\nconsole operators mature their engineering skills and graduate from console to the\nengineering support.\nI. Equipment Sizing\nAll the constellation operators expressed the concern over the ability to update ground\nequipment and software. The common solution is to have a backup control center that can\nhandle operations for enough time to perform any upgrades to the prime facility.\nThere was a significant difference amongst the constellation operators in how they\nutilized their back up centers for activities other than normal upgrades. The most efficient\nuse of these resources was the constellation that split payload operations and satellite\noperations. Each site was prime for either payload or satellite. When the primary satellite\ncontrol center had a problem, the payload operations center could assume control for a\nshort period of time.\nSeveral organizations maintained backup control facilities within driving distance to\nthe prime sites. These organizations felt that this comfortable distance was a real benefit\nto them. This is driven by corporate reasons as well as the particular disaster that is being\nmitigated. This has changed over the years and is also driven by location. For example,\nan operation in California must plan locations around earthquake fault lines.\n\nThe smaller constellations have a dedicated string of command and telemetry\nequipment for each satellite. They share resources in the planning and analysis areas.\nThey also have common test equipment.\nThe larger constellations handle multiple satellites with each string. This is where the\neconomies of scale are realized. Most of the systems are handling many satellites at the\nsame time. The expert systems are handling all the satellites and feeding this information\nto the operators.\nJ. Workload\nAll the constellations have introduced automation to reduce the manual workload of\neach function. However one constellation has taken on more functional responsibilities\nand kept the staffing level fairly constant. This is a good practice if the business base is\ngrowing. But for cost conscious organizations, this is not possible.\nThe way that each team has been able to reduce the workload is to build automation\nsoftware that takes over most of the routine activities. The operators and engineers are\nused mostly to handle the exceptions. And in the case of large constellations, this is not\nan uncommon event. One constellation counted 15,000 activities per week.\nOne best practice that we identified was the use of remote monitoring capabilities.\nThis team has set up several laptop computers with encrypted disks. They can get access\nto the telemetry and other systems through wireless networks and from remote location\nsuch as a home. This system allows for the most efficient use of the expertise that is on\nthe team.\nAs the satellites of the constellation age, the workload is expected to increase due to a\nnumber of factors. There is a need for more staff to process changes for handling the\nolder spacecraft. This is compounded by the fact that there will be a need to keep track of\nmany more satellites individually. There are many differences from one satellite to the\nnext. As a result, there are more individual spacecraft specific procedures and software.\n\nK. Automation\nThe best automation practice is to put the automation on board the spacecraft. Using a\nGPS reduces the flight dynamics and time correlation tasks to a minimum. They still have\nto plan orbital adjustments, but, orbit determination is virtually eliminated. When onboard solutions are not practical, deployment of expert systems on the ground are\npreferred.\nIn one case, the satellites are susceptible to spontaneous power switching. This\nproblem, multiplied across an entire constellation, takes most of the operators\'\nmonitoring and response time. It is also the cause for most of the down time of the\nservice. The response has become very routine for the operators, but the satellites don\'t\nhave the ability to autonomously perform this response. In this case the automation was\nperformed on the ground with an automated detection and response. A further best\npractice was to deploy automation processes to use more than one telemetry point to\ndetermine the validity of the anomaly before automatically starting the procedure to\nremedy the problem.\nIn general most of the constellations have automated and streamlined ground\noperations to handle the multiplication factor that comes with a constellation. But as new\ngenerations of satellites are developed, these ground operations are migrating many\nfunctions on board the satellites.\n\nL. Lessons Learned\nOne organization wished that they had enough simulation capacity to stress all the data\nsources of a complete constellation. The larger constellations really do have a scale up\nfactor that should have been simulated. More hardware was needed and several\noperational concerns were satisfied before resolution of this situation was realized.\nThe initial launch irons out most of the ground software and operations plans. It would\nbe best to have some planned delay between the first launch and the rest of the launch\ncampaign. This time is needed to make updates to systems and mature the ground teams\nfor a more complete constellation.\nM.Future Challenges\nMost NASA operations teams are used to operate one satellite in one control center.\nDecisions are usually balanced by the health and status of that one satellite. Some of the\nlongest lived of these are rarely older than 20 years old.\nThe newer larger constellations knew at the onset of the constellation development\nthat it would be difficult to change ground systems. They made their choices of operating\nsystems and operations software products. However, all the speakers expressed that\nchanging out systems is still a concern. It must be recognized that no matter what is\nchosen as the latest product, the future cannot be predicted.\nThe challenge of these constellations for the upcoming years is how to proceed for\nextended lifetimes. New satellites introduced into the constellation will have new\ncapabilities. Ground computers will need to be replaced. Yet, the constellation will be a\nmixture of older and newer designs.\n111.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper presented several best practices of constellations.: Some of the\nrecommendations are:\nEliminate operations tasks on the ground rather than streamline them on the\nground. It is more efficient. The use of a GPS is the best example.\nTreat the constellation as a whole.\nPerform ground software updates in house and plan routine refreshes.\nDesign for multiple satellites on multiple launch vehicles.\nHave a backup control center at a comfortable distance from prime operations\nfacility.\nFinally, each constellation operation is operating in a competitive, global market.\nInevitably only the operations that can produce the best product at the best price that will\ncontinue to survive. Satellite technology will continue to improve and new generations of\nsatellites will need to be integrated into the older constellations. However, one\nconstellation operator suggested the best practice of all, "Simple really is better."\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the Mission Architect function on the\nMission Operations and Mission Services contract at the NASA GSFC.
