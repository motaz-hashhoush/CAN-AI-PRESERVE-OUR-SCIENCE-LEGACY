This radar system produced unrivaled 3-D images of the Earth's Surface. The mission was launched at 12:31 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. This tape shows a pre-launch briefing. The panel members are George Diller, NASA Public Affairs; Scott Higginbotham, SRTM Payload Manager; Steve Altemus, NASA Test Director; and Ed Priselac, Meteorologist. The briefing opens with an announcement by Mr Diller that there were no further developments with the engine problems, and requests that questions about that issue be held for another press briefing. Steve Altemus summarized the situation and the steps to be taken. Scott Higginbotham reported that there were no problems with the mission hardware. Ed Priselac reported favorable weather for tanking and launch, and at emergency landing sites.", "title": "STS-99 Countdown Status Briefing", "stiType": "VIDEO", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T13:28:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Video", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-04-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000027608, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000027608, "id": "825391a4473143ebb34c7305d384cb9a", "publicationDate": "2000-01-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
