Hence, the\nfingers 15 are disposed as close as possible to the roots\nof the segment 12a.\nThe blade elements 13, typically, are disposed at an 5\nangle with respect to a longitudinal axis of the casing 10\nand the fingers 15 are pitched at a complementary angle\nto provide a surface-to-surface contact between each\nfinger and each blade element. The length of the fingers\n15 is such that they extend across the entire surface of a 10\nblade element as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4. It will be\nappreciated from FIG. 3 that an arcuately directed\nforce can be applied to the base of each blade element\nby the fingers 15.\nTurning now to FIG. 1, the vertical arm 16 is con- 15\nnected to a torque shaft 21 which is mounted for rotation about an axis 22. The shaft 21 is mounted in parallel\nplate members 23,24 which have end plate members 25,\n26 and the plate members generally define a rectangular\nframe. The rectangular frame is slidably supported by 20\nparallel shafts 27, 28 which extend through bushings\n(not shown) on the plate members 23, 24. The shafts 27,\n28 are mounted on upright or vertical base members\n30-33 so that the rectangular frame is suspended above\nthe floor. The base members 30-33 are suitably con- 25\nstructed and arranged to receive a compressor casing\nshell 10 and spaced apart floor base members 34 are\nprovided for central support of a case 10. The rectangular frame mounts the torque shaft 21 so that its axis 22 is\ncoincidental to the axis for the cylindrically shaped 30\ncasing 10. In this arrangement, the end surface 18 of the\narm 16 is spaced co-planarly from the inner surface 19\nof the casing 10. Extending in a diametrically opposite\ndirection from the torque arm 16 is another arm extension 36. It will be appreciated that any force applied to 35\nthe extreme end of the arm 36 will be transmitted to the\nfingers 15 on the end of the arm 16. A force can be\napplied to arm 36 by any suitable means.\nTo provide a constant force to the arm 16, a sprocket\n40 can be attached to the torque shaft 21 between the 40\nplate members 23, 24. A chain 41 attached to a hydrau- (\nlie force means 43 transmits constant pressure from the\nforce means 43 to the sprocket and to the arm 16. The\nhydraulic actuator 43 is attached to a superstructure 44\nwhich, in turn, is attached to the rectangular frame. The 45\nactuator 43 can be actuated in any suitable manner.\nIn the practice of the present invention, the shell case\nis fixed in position on the floor base members 34 and the\nside edges 45 of the case are fixed in position by latch\nblocks 46 so that the sides edges generally lie in a hori- 50\nzontal plane. In this position, the apparatus aligns the\naxis 22 of the torque shaft 21 with the axis of the case 10.\nTo remove the segments, the rectangular frame is\nshifted along shafts 27 and 28 to interfit the fingers 15 on\nthe arm 16 in the blade elements of the segment nearest 55\nto an open side edge 45 of the case. The fingers 15\ninterfit with the blade members in a segment so that\nupon the application of a torque force on the arm 16, the\nfingers 15 apply substantially uniform pressure to the\nblade members. The pressure is increased by the hy- 60\ndraulic actuator 43 and/or additional force can be applied to arm 36 to remove a segment. Upon removal of\na segment, the frame and fingers are repositioned to\nengage the blade members of the next adjacent segment.\nThe base members are removed-from the case in a se- 65\nquential fashion as described above.\nWhen it is desired to replace the segments, the process is reversed and the fingers 15 are used to slide the\n\n4\n\nsegment 11 to its location within the case member. As\nwill be appreciated the ability to independently act on\neach segment 11 facilitates the relocation of base elements 12 in a proper location in a case.\nWhile the apparatus is not illustrated for a rotor it will\nbe appreciated that in this instance the fingers would be\nexternal to the rotor and would otherwise act in the\nsame manner as described with respect to a case.\nWhile particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it is apparent that\nchanges and modifications may be made without departing from this invention in its broader aspects; and\ntherefore, the aim in the appended claims is to cover all\nsuch changes and modifications as fall within the true\nspirit and scope of this invention.\nI claim:\n1.
