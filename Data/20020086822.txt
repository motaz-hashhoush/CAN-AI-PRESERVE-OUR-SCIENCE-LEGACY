b'Light Reflector\n\nlighting afixture is gett right,\nfluorescent\nting a boost in reflectivity through installation of\nLightdriver \xc2\xae, a thin, tough\nthermoplastic\nfilm plated\nwith aluminum capable of\nreflecting 95 percent of the\nvisible light striking it.\nLightdriver is marketed\nby\nUltra Sales, Inc., Colonia,\nNew Jersey.\nLightdriver increases\nbrightness without adding\nbulbs and allows energy\nsavings by removing some\nbulbs, because the mirrorlike\nsurface cuts the light loss\ngenerally occasioned by the\nconventional low reflectivity\nwhite painted surface above\nthe bulbs in many fluorescent fixtures. With\nLightdriver, says Ultra Sales,\na 45 percent reduction in\nelectricity usage is attainable\nby removing two of the\nbulbs in a four bulb fixture;\nthe remaining two will still\nprovide excellent lighting.\nAdditional savings accrue\nfrom lower air conditioning\nbills due to fewer heatproducing bulbs in use and\nfrom bulb replacement costs.\nBonus advantages include\neven lighting throughout\na\nwork area, less glare and\neyestrain, and the fact that\nLightdriver does not reflect\nmost ultraviolet light.\n\nSold in sheets and cut to\nfit fixtures, Lightdriver is\nmade in three layers: the\nthermoplastic\nfilm, which\nprotects the reflective surface\nfrom corrosion and insulates\nit electrically; the aluminum\nreflector, which provides\ngreater reflectivity than a\nstandard mirror; and a permanent adhesive with removable backing (top) for\nsimple installation.\nLightdriver is one more\nadaptation of a spinoff metallization technology that\noriginated in a 1960 NASA\nproject involving development of a lightweight,\n\nhighly reflective skin for a\nballoon type satellite. The\nneed was met by Metallized\nProducts (MP), Winchester,\nMassachusetts (see page\n70), which developed a\nmetallized plastic film coated\nwith a mist of aluminum\nparticles. That development\ntriggered extensive R&D by\nMP and other companies on\nmetaUized materials, which\nfound broad application as\nreflecting insulators and radiation barriers in space systems and in a broad range of\ncommercial products.\n\xc2\xaeLightdriver is a registered\nof Ultra Sales, Inc.\n\ntrademark\n\nEnergy\n\n91\n\n'
