The discussed functions for the permanently manned space facility include: (1) development of new technologies and related commercial products; (2) observations of the Earth and the universe; (3) provision of service facilities for resupply, maintenance, upgrade and repair of payloads and spacecraft; (4) provision of a transportation node for stationing, processing and dispatching payloads and vehicles; (5) provision of manufacturing and assembly facilities; (6) provision of a storage depot for parts and payloads; and (7) provision of a staging base for future space endeavors. The fundamental concept for the Space Station, as given, is that it be designed, operated, and evolved in response to a broad variety of scientific, technological, and commercial user interests. The Space Shuttle's role as the principal transportation system for the construction and maintenance of the Space Station and the servicing and support of the station crew is also discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900011734, "id": "a8bc0d9b9e1f43a2add9f3386cfb1403", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900011734.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900011734/downloads/19900011734.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900011734/downloads/19900011734.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900011734/downloads/19900011734.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
