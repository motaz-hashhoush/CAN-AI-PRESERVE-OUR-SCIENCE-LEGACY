As such, it gives information regarding the heating and dissipation occurring within the shock. The total cross-shock potential can be determined by integrating a weighted electron pressure gradient through the shock, but this requires knowledge of the density and temperature profiles. Here, a recently proposed alternative approach relying on particle dynamics is exploited to provide an independent estimate of this potential. Both determinations are applied to slow mode shocks which form the plasma sheet boundary in the deep geomagnetic tail as observed by ISEE 3. The two methods correlate well. There is no indication of the expected transition from resistive to viscous shocks, although the highest Mach number shocks show the highest potentials. The implications of these results for the electron dissipation mechanisms and turbulence at the shock are discussed.", "title": "Electron dynamics and potential jump across slow mode shocks", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T04:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870051954, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schwartz, Steven J."}, "organization": {"name": "London Univ.", "location": "United Kingdom"}}, "id": "09998afa2992434a8652d53b099dec34"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870051954, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Douglas, Fraser T."}, "organization": {"name": "Queen Mary College", "location": "London, United Kingdom"}}, "id": "79371157e93349f59501d36bd0aa976e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19870051954, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thomsen, Michelle F."}, "organization": {"name": "London Univ.", "location": "United Kingdom"}}, "id": "6aa27e4c00fd4315ae78a6351ac3ec9f"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19870051954, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Feldman, William C."}, "organization": {"name": "Los Alamos National Laboratory", "location": "NM, United States"}}, "id": "3637ccc9655c4a2aa7a04ea19022f9fa"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870051954, "publications": [{"volume": "92", "submissionId": 19870051954, "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "1919ceff6896480ea4a7670c42c32a18", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1987-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
