For comparison, three other discs of the same three materials were similarly melted or welded on the ground. The power source of the melting was an electron beam unit. Results are presented which support the concept that the major difference between ground base and Skylab samples (i.e., large elongated grains in ground base samples versus nearly equiaxed and equal sized grains in Skylab samples) can be explained on the basis of constitutional supercooling, and not on the basis of surface phenomena. Microstructural observations on the weld samples and present explanations for some of these observations are examined. In particular, ripples and their implications to weld solidification were studied. Evidence of pronounced copper segregation in the Skylab A1 weld samples, and the tantalum samples studied, indicates a weld microhardness (and hence strength) that is uniformly higher than the ground base results, which is in agreement with previous predictions. Photographs are shown of the microstructure of the various alloys.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760020313, "id": "10c465b2f9df410ebd1c840cc53b0088", "publicationDate": "1976-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760020313.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760020313/downloads/19760020313.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760020313/downloads/19760020313.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760020313/downloads/19760020313.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
