Nascom is a generic term referring collectively to a global system of circuits and switching and terminal facilities established and operated by NASA to provide longhaul operational communications support for all NASA projects. Aspects of network evolution are discussed, taking into account the integrated Nascom network. A description is presented of the present Nascom network, giving attention to the Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN), the Deep Space Network (DSN), the voice network, and the Teletypewriter (TTY) Network. Concepts and techniques for the 1980's are also considered. It is pointed out that the Nascom Network will extend the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) forward- and return-link services to users of the TDRSS by providing ground-to-ground data communications links between the NASA Ground Terminal at White Sands, New Mexico, and major user spacecraft control centers and data capture/data processing facilities.", "title": "Ground-to-ground communications for mission support", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T19:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820033777, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dickinson, W.
