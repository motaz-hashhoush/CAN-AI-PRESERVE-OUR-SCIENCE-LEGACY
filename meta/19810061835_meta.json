In mesometeorology and severe storms, satellite stereography of cloud topography and temperature profiling from GOES-VAS promise dramatic developments in both nowcasting and prediction. In global weather, the initial results from the year long Global Weather Experiment conclusively demonstrate the enhanced forecast skill emanating from the use of satellite data, especially cloud track winds and temperature profiles. In climate, empirical studies and numerical experiments point to the feasibility of useful climate predictions on monthly and seasonal time scales. They also indicate the kinds of surface boundary conditions to which climate is sensitive and which need to be observed from space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19810061835, "endDate": "1981-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society"}}, "meetingId": "6adc3111816d4d5390898aeed0dfe971", "id": "2a9c8834fe9248a78e12e23bb5628715"}], "name": "Goddard Memorial Symposium on International Space Technical Applications", "location": "Arlington, VA", "id": "6adc3111816d4d5390898aeed0dfe971", "startDate": "1981-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810061835, "id": "78e94bd270244df094d67aa540ee1f74", "publicationDate": "1981-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
