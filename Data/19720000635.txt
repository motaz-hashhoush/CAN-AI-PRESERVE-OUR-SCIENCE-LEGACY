Accelerometers which meet these requirements\nare complicated and expensive.\n\nSection A-A\n\nThe concept:\nA design has been proposed for an inexpensive\naccelerometer which would work by applying pressure\nto a fluid during acceleration. This pressure is used to\nmove a shuttle, and the shuttle movement is sensed\nand calibrated to give acceleration readings.\n\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States \t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe proposed accelerometer is shown in the figure.\nA cylindrical container houses a magnetically banded\nshuttle. At one end of the container there is a leakproof assembly of bellows and a weighted mass threadable into the open end of the container. An externally\nexcited electromagnetic pick-up is placed outside of the\ncontainer, but in line with the shuttle movement.\nThe container is of shock and chemical resistant\nnonmetal construction with an internal thread to accept\nthe mass/bellows assembly. Inside the container, the\nshuttle is suspended in a fluid and kept concentric by\nmeans of longitudinal ribs on the container. The bellows\nend of the container is provided with a valve to release\nexcess air or fluid that may be accumulated when the\nassembly is threaded into the container to center the\nshuttle on the pickoff.\nWhen an acceleration force is applied to the mass, the\nbellows presses against the fluid. The shuttle then moves\nto compensate for the increased pressure on the fluid.\n\nB72-10636\n\n\t\n\nThis movement is sensed by the electromagnetic pick-up.\nWhen the acceleration force is removed, the bellows,\nand thus the shuttle, return to their original positions. \t\nNote:\nRequests for further information should be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nKennedy Space Center\nCode AD-PAT\nKennedy Space Center, Florida 32899\nReference: B72-10636\nPatent status:\nNASA has decided not to apply for a patent.\nSource: John Mutzberg of\r\nThe Boeing Company\r\nunder contract to\r\nKennedy Space Flight Center\r\n(KSC-10618)\n\nCategory 06\n\n40\n\n"
