The system installed 10 spray bars in the inlet plenum for ice crystal generation using 222 spray nozzles. As an altitude test chamber, the PSL is capable of simulating icing events at altitude in a groundtest facility. The system was designed to operate at altitudes from 4,000 to 40,000 ft at Mach numbers up to 0.8M and inlet total temperatures from -60 to +15 degF. This paper and presentation will be part of a series of presentations on PSL Icing and will cover the development of the icing capability through design, developmental testing, installation, initial calibration, and validation engine testing. Information will be presented on the design criteria and process, spray bar developmental testing at Cox and Co., system capabilities, and initial calibration and engine validation test. The PSL icing system was designed to provide NASA and the icing community with a facility that could be used for research studies of engine icing by duplicating in-flight events in a controlled ground-test facility. With the system and the altitude chamber we can produce flight conditions and cloud environments to simulate those encountered in flight. The icing system can be controlled to set various cloud uniformities, droplet median volumetric diameter (MVD), and icing water content (IWC) through a wide variety of conditions. The PSL chamber can set altitudes, Mach numbers, and temperatures of interest to the icing community and also has the instrumentation capability of measuring engine performance during icing testing. PSL last year completed the calibration and initial engine validation of the facility utilizing a Honeywell ALF502-R5 engine and has duplicated in-flight roll back conditions experienced during flight testing. This paper will summarize the modifications and buildup of the facility to accomplish these tests.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140008692, "endDate": "2014-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lockheed Martin Corp.", "location": "Bethesda, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a11e3dc8a213405d84912811de87db78", "id": "5c8b3c11e936419bb9a8b10838e0d3a1"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "a11e3dc8a213405d84912811de87db78", "id": "84465a796a2b407ca1c77da948085448"}], "name": "AIAA Atmospheric and Space Environments Conference", "location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "a11e3dc8a213405d84912811de87db78", "startDate": "2014-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140008692, "endDate": "2014-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Lockheed Martin Corp.", "location": "Bethesda, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "870b589aad6541f39c30f91569ab1a0b", "id": "c6818e289dfc4127b12429120fbfad4e"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Los Angeles, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "870b589aad6541f39c30f91569ab1a0b", "id": "da7149f85b0940ac90b313ef1754d035"}], "name": "AIAA Aviation and Aeronautics Forum and Exposition (AVIATION 2014)", "location": "Atlanta, Georgia", "id": "870b589aad6541f39c30f91569ab1a0b", "startDate": "2014-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140008692, "id": "3de7194073cd429d93d8b71cbeed0fa2", "publicationDate": "2014-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140008692.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140008692/downloads/20140008692.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140008692/downloads/20140008692.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140008692/downloads/20140008692.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
