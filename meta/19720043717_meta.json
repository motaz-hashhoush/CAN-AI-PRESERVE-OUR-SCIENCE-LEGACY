Two approaches to the system were considered:  an adaptive simultaneous multibeam mode and a hopped-beam mode. In the former case, both interbeam and intrabeam adaptive power management are used, while in the latter, beam energy is controlled through the use of time division techniques. The objectives of the experiment, design and implementation approaches, and potential applications are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19720043717, "endDate": "1972-04-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "ed186ac125744ed282774e05809b8ba8", "id": "449642dc9d764ed6b44b46202eb7dc81"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Communications Satellite Systems Conference", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "ed186ac125744ed282774e05809b8ba8", "startDate": "1972-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720043717, "id": "b2e460bc501a439fa24053046e793508", "publicationDate": "1972-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
