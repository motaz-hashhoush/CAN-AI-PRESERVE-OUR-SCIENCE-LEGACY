Simulations are to be carried out in a number of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft cabins using professional cabin crews and paid passenger subjects. A number of variables are considered including passenger load, flight attendant compliment, cabin class and cabin activities. Various scenarios are also being played out in the exercises.", "title": "Secure Cabin Exercise Briefing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T01:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030020338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bogue, Rod"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Dryden Flight Research Center", "location": "Edwards, CA United States"}}, "id": "9f04bfea4270414886ce05fc98d74fbc"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030020338, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030020338, "id": "31b2653ac790470db9c73bce873c912e", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Second NASA Aviation Safety Program Weather Accident Prevention Review", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030020303, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Second NASA Aviation Safety Program Weather Accident Prevention Review", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
