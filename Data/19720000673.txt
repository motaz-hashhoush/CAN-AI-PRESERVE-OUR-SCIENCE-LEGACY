They are issued, to encourage\nCommercial application. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the National Technical Information\nService, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Requests for individual copies or questions relating to the Tech Brief program may\nbe directed to the Technology Utilization Office, NASA, Code KT, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\nGeometric Field-Line Calculations\nThe problem:\nTo calculate the three components of the vector field\nfrom a spherical harmonic expansion using either geocentric or geodetic coordinates as input and output. The\nprogram also contains field-line tracing routines useful in\nseveral applications, for example: locating the position of\nconjugate points, determining mirror point locations for\nparticles at a given position with a given pitch angle, etc.\n\ntexts and is not included here. The coordinates entered\ninto ALLMAG must be geocentric. If input must be\ngeodetic, then the subroutine GDALMG must be called to\nconvert the coordinates to the proper input parameters.\nIn the line-tracing, LINTRA, routine, the method used\nis to solve differential equations defining a field-line in\norder to obtain the correct values for field-line values.\n\nNotes:\nThe solution:\nThe three components of the vector field are returned\nas output in either geocentric or geodetic coordinates\naccording to how they were entered, whereas the field-line\ntracing routine returns a line that passes through a point\nand is everywhere parallel to the location field direction as\ndetermined by the model.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe program is actually three subroutines, ALLMAG,\nGDALMG, and LINTRA. ALLMAG is a fundamental\nroutine that calculates three components of the vector\nfield from a spherical harmonic expansion. The relevant\nmathematical formulation is readily available in related\n\n1. This program is written in FORTRAN IV for use on an\nIBM-360/(40, 75, and 91), IBM-7094, UNIVAC . l 108,\nand CDC-6600.\nInquiries concerning this program should be directed\nto:\nCOSMIC\n112 Barrow Hall\nUniversity of Georgia\nAthens, Georgia 30601\nReference: GSC . l 1597\nSource: E.
