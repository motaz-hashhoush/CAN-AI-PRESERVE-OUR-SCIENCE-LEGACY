The achievements and flaws of rocket boosters are discussed as well as the use of reusable spacecraft. The need for orbiting satellite solar power plants and related astrionics for active control of large space structures for space stations and colonies in an age of space industrialization is demonstrated. Various forms of spacecraft propulsion are described including liquid propellant rocket engines, nuclear reactors, thermonuclear rocket engines, electrorocket engines, electromagnetic engines, magnetic gas dynamic generators, electromagnetic mass accelerators (rail guns), laser rocket engines, pulse nuclear rocket engines, ramjet thermonuclear rocket engines, and photon rockets. The possibilities of interstellar flight are assessed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840015600, "id": "4ad18046891c45199509d0e34a808441", "publicationDate": "1984-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840015600.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840015600/downloads/19840015600.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840015600/downloads/19840015600.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840015600/downloads/19840015600.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
