WSTF tested an ABB K-Flow\nmodel K-20 Coriolis flowmeter using these three available flow measuring devices. The goal was\nto test the Coriolis meter against other WSTF meters and evaluate the potential for the Coriolis\nmeter as a calibration device for the Cox sonic meter and possibly other gas flow meters.\nThe K-20 meter was tested first against the Cox nozzle using GN: at 7 to 75 g/s. Nearly all the\ndata points landed outside the ABB Company specifications for their Coriolis meter, but mostly\nremainedwithin\ntheCox nozzle\nerror\nbands.Thisisnotsurprising,\nsince\ntheuncertainty\nintheCox\nsystemis\nabout I% and thespecifications\nonthe K-20 show accuracy about 0.6to 0.2% inthe\nof\n\n27-3\n\ntested\nrange.No relevant\nconclusions regarding the Coriolis meter were made from this set of data,\n" although the meters showed better agreement at the higher mass flow rates (45 to 75 g/s) than at\nthe lower end of the scale.\nNext, the Coriolis meter was compared\n\nto the Bell Prover, which is only capable of low flows (< ?\n\ng/s). Again, all the data was outside the ABB company error specified accuracy. For instance, the\nspecifications show an error of about 1% at 7 g/s, but the test showed 2 to 4% error.\nFinally, the Coriolis meter was used with liquid water and compared to the EG&G calibration\nsystem. Only for the higher flow range (over 60 g/s) was the data within the ABB Company\nspecified accuracy.\n\nBelow 60 g/s, most of the data was outside the specified accuracy.\n\nThe conclusion was that the meter did not _rform _ specified in low liouid or low gas flow. The\naccuracy at higher flows could not be determined with available WSTF measuring devices. It was\nnot proven that the meter does not give the same readings in liquid as it does m gas. However, it\nwas also not proven that the Coriolis flowmeter could be calibrated in liquid and then used as a\ncalibration standard in gas.\nSUMMARY\n\nOF THE LITERATURE\n\nREVIEW\n\nGenesi (April, 1991) focused on orifice-plate, segmental-wedge, venturi flow-nozzle, V-cone,\ntarget, and osciUatmg-van\xc2\xa2 flowmcters. In the following month (Genesi, May, 1991), he covered\nvariable-area,\nvortex-shedding, magnetic, turbine, ultrasonic, Coriolis, and thermal-dispersion\nmeters. Table 1 is a brief summary of his meter descriptions.\nThe Coriolis nmssflowmeter\nconsists of one or more robes that are vibrated at a natural\nresonance frequency by electromagnetic\ndrivers. Their harmonic vibrations impart Coriolis\n(angular) forces proportional to the product of fluid density and velocity that act against the wall.\nThis results in a secondary movement that is superimposed on the primary vibration, which varies\nproportionally with mass flowrate. A sensor measures the phase difference between inlet and outlet\ncaused by the magnitude of this secondary vibration. They supposedly are capable of an accuracy\nto 0.2% of the flowrate.\nThe Direct Measurement Corp. (DMC) has developed a Coriolis mass flowmeter that vibrates in\nthe radial mode (Hahn, 1994). The flow path is a single straight tube with no intrusive elements.\nTim vibration is induced at the center of the length and flattens the tube by about one thousandth\nof an inch. As fluid flows through, the combination of the fluid velocity relative to the tube and the\nrotational component of the vibration creates a Coriolis acceleration of the fluid. The reaction\nforces in the tube cause the tube to distort differently than the no-flow distortion. The difference in\ntube distortion is a measure of the flowrate. According to the company, the vibrational frequency\n(2000 Hz and above) is higher than most other Coriolis meters use and also higher than most noise\nvibration that may be produced by other flow effects, such as sonic nozzles in the line. The meter\nwas designed specifically for gas metering. There will be a distinct advantage over other Coriolis\nmeters that have been shown to lose accuracy because of noise and/or high velocity in gas.\n\n27-4\n\nTABLE 1.-FLOWMETER\n\nCOMPARISON\n\nFluid Type\n\nMeter Type\n\nAccuracy\n\nComments\n\n(%)\nSquare Edge Orifice\nSegment Wedge\nVenturi Tube\n\nGas or Liquid\nGas or Liquid\nGas or Liquid\n\n0.5 to 3 by volume\n0.5 to 5 by volume\n0.5 to 1.5 by volume\n\nEc_e and tap wear\nGood stability\nGood stability\n\nFlow Nozzle\n\nGas or Liquid\n\n1 to 2 by volume\n\nGood stability\n\nV-Cone\n\nGas or Liquid\n\n0.5 to 2 by volume\n\nGood stability\n\nOscillating Vane\nTarget\nVariable Area\n\nLiquid\nGas or Liquid\nGas or Liquid\n\n0.5 by volume\n0.5 to 2 by volume\n0.5 to 5 by volume\n\nSensorr_lacement\nWear\nGood stability\n\nVortex\n\nGas or Liquid\n\n0.5 to 1.5 by volume\n\nLiquid with Suspended\nSolids\n\n1 to 5 by volume\n\nCorrosion, Erosion, &\nReynolds no. limit\nInstallation sensitivity\n\nGas or Liquid\n\n1 to 5 by volume\n\nInstallation sensitivity\n\nThermal Dispersion\n\nGas\n\n1 to 5 by mass\n\nMagnetic\n\nLiquid\n\n0.2 to I by volume\n\nSensor buildup\nsensitivity\nGood stability\n\nTurbine\n\nGas or Liquid\n\n0.1 to 1 by volume\n\nCoriolis\n\nLiquid or\nLimited Gas Use\n\n0.2 to 2 by mass\n\nUltra-sound\nUltraTime\n\nDoppler\n\nsound Transit\n\nVogtlin\n\nand Txchabold\n\nprinciple\n\napplied\n\nphotodiodes\nThe drifts\nintervals.\n\nVogtlm\n\n(1994)\n\nto straight\n\nto measure\n\nchange\n\nin the transmitters,\n\ngives\n\ngives\n\nan interesting\n\na simple\n\ntube flowmeters.\n\nexample\n\nand clear explanation\nThey also explain\n\nin frequency\nreceivers\n\nBearing wear, viscosity,\nand installation sensitive\nRe-zero for various\nfluids, one vendor for gas\n\nwhere the phase\n\nand amplifiers\n\nof Coriolis\n\nof\n\nforce and the\nusing\n\nshift is proportional\n\nand axe checked\n\nforces:\n\nCoriolis\n\nsignal processing\n\nrivers\n\nflowing\n\nto mass\n\nautomatically\n\nflow.\n\nat set\n\nnorth to south exhibit\n\nheavier erosion on their western\nshores ff in northern hemisphere\nand eastern shores if in southern\nhemisphere.\nNote in the northern hemisphere,\nthe Coriolis acceleration\nof the river is toward the\neast but the corresponding\nderive\n\nreaction\n\nthe F_,_o_ = 2m\xc2\xa2ov based\n\nthe other.

The meter sensitivity and resonance frequency can suffer\nfrom non-linear\neffectsecauseofthestresseducedby a process\nb\nr\nparameter,\nsuch astheline\npressure. A list of the process parameters to consider in a liquid to gas comparison:\n1. Temperature effect: elastic properties and thermal expansion render temperature\ncorrection\nnecessary. llCMFs contain temperature\nA\na\nsensor\nand thecorrection\nalgorithm\nis implemented in the instrument\'s soRware.\n2. Pressure effect is due to the stress stiffening of the mechanical oscillator. Generally the\nmanufacturers\nneglect this and no correction is applied. However, with gas under high\npressure it must be accounted for. Fommately,\nwith straight pipe design, a theoretical\nestimate can be made.\n3. The fluid velocity effect is a true non-linearity of the sensor. This is computable in a\nstraight-pipe design.\n4. It is common practice to calibrate a CMF with water. However, it is believed that for a\ngas the sound velocity or compressibility effect could be significant, as has been found for\nthe vibrating\nelement gas densitometer.\nKeita concluded the following:\n1. The main contribution to the shift in the meter factors is due to the pressure.\n2. The compressibility\neffect can be smaller than the experimental uncertainty for a highfrequency CMF if the pipe diameter is small enough.\n3. The pressure effect and compressibility effect partly compensate for each other.\n4. Despite their high resonance frequency, straight pipe CMF\'s are suitable for gas\nmeasurement, and their behavior is predictable.\nCarpron (1994) reported on tests that were performed at the Colorado Engineering Experiment\nStation, Inc.\n(CEESI) to compare discharge coefficients for sonicflow nozzles in GH2 to air. Two\nsystems were used to measure flowrates of air. One was a direct gravirnetric scale reading\n(Primary B); the other was a volume-pressure-temperature\ncalculation (Primary C) for mass of air.\nThe GH2 was only measured with the Primary C system. All three correlated mostly within their\n95% confidence interval. The most deviation appeared to be for GH2 at low and high Reynolds\nnumbers.\nBlickley (1990) focused on the shapes and specialty designs of Coriolis flowmeters to reduce the\neffects of fatigue stress in the meter tubes. Torsional twisting of the meter tube does not create\nlocalized high concentrations\nof stress that can result from pure bending. Instead, it distributes the\nstresslongthewhole length\na\noftube.\nThe effectsf pipevibration thereadings\no\non\ncanbe reduced\nby operating at higher oscillation frequencies (700-1100\nEndress & Hauser, Inc., located in Greenwood, Indiana.\n\nHz Vs 40-120 Hz)\n\naccording to the\n\nBabb (1992) reported that Exac Corporation had an SX series flowmeter that costs about the same\nas a good volumetric meter. The company surveyed customers and found most flow applications\nrequire about 0.5% accuracy.\nExac Corporation has since merged with Micro\ntheir meters are sold under the Micro Motion name.\n\n27-6\n\nMotion, Inc. and all\n\nTESTINGFACILITIES\nTheInstituteof GasTechnology\nTheInstitute Gas\nof\n\nTechnology (IGT) has a multi-purpose meter testing facility capable of testing\nmetering technologies for high flow rate and high-pressure natural gas applications (Rowley, et al).\nThe testing and facility is supported by a consortium of utilities under IGT\'s Sustaining\nMembership Program (SMP). Meters are being evaluated that could, potentially, be applied to\nnatural gas vehicles (\'NGV) at fueling station operating conditions. Two Coriolis meters have been\nevaluated:\n1. The Micro Motion Model DH025S\n2. The Micro Motion Model DH038S\nDH025S.\n\nwhich is commonly used in NGV dispensing\nwhich has a higher flow capacity and is a modification\n\nof the\n\nThe test facility consists of#ping,\ncontrol components and storage vessels mounted on a highprecision scale. The test loop is configured with two high-pressure\nstorage vessels rated at 3600\npsig and volume of 7 cu. ft. The loop is designed to accommodate flow rates up to 1700 scfm at\n3000 psig. Before the test begins, the test stand piping on the scale is pressurized to the equilibrium\npressure, and the scale is tared. The gas flow is directed through the meter and into high-pressure\nstorage vessels mounted on the precision balance.\nMicro Motion DH025S test results:\nThis meter was tested at 3000 psig and flow rates from 15 Ib/min to 40 lb/min (875 scfm of NG).\nThe meter was very unstable at flow rates over 25 lb/min but was very stable at flow rates of\n23 lb/min and below. It appears to be have uncertainty of less than 0.3% at 23 Ib/min and lower,\nbut at 33 lb/min the uncertainty jumped to nearly 15% even though the meter is rated for as much\nas 40 lb/min.\nMicro Motion DH038S test results:\nMicro Motion developed a larger meter which has a 0 to 50 lbs/min and 5200 psig pressure\ncapability. Tests were conducted at various line pressures and flow rates. The threshold flow rate\nat each pressure was determined based on the flow output stability from the meter and the overall\nerror of the meter total compared with the high-precision\nperformance was similar to that of the DH025S.\nIn addressing\n\nscale.\n\nIn general, the pattern of\n\nthe high flow rate problem, Micro Motion said the test results identified gas flow\n\neffects that disturb meter performance above some threshold flow rate. They determined that the\nthreshold flow rate is closely related to gas velocity. Therefore, higher gas flow rates need to be\nmeasured at higher pressures. Note that the higher pressure increases the density, resulting in a\ncorresponding\ndecreased velocity.\nIGT is currently expanding its facility to handle higher pressures and flow rates. The program has\nbeen accelerated by a recently awarded contract from the Gas Research Institute (GRI).\nChris Blazek, of IGT, said they have an 8000 cu R scale for gravimetric analysis (about 3000 lbs).\nThey can add 200 to 300 lbs N2 gas. It can measure to 2 grams. Gases used are CNG and GN:,\n\n27-7\n\nsaystheycanprobablymeasure heliumbuthave never done it. thinks\nHe\ntheycan evenmeasure\nHz but not classified for H2 service. Blazck has 1000 psi Hz experience. They have 40,000 cubic\nfeet of gas storage capacity. Patricia Rowley said the scales are "Metier Scales" accurate to 0.05\nlbs. used in their gravimetric analysis and the system may be adapted to H2.\nSouthwest\n\nResearch\n\nInstitute\n(SwRI) in San Antonio\n\nJohn Gregor at the Gas Research Institute said they are developing\nThey have three test loops:\nDistribution test loop: 0-40 psig, 2500 acth (42 acfin)\n\na flow calibration lab at SwRI.\n\nLow pressure test loop: 0-210 psig, 36,000 acth (600 acfm)\nHigh pressure test loop: 185- 1440 psig, 120,000 acfla (2000acfin)\nThey can achieve level accuracyof 0.1% usinga tankon a gyroscopic\na\nof\nscale\n(made in\nGermany).\nGRI is a private, not-for-profit membership organization that plans, manages, and develops\nfinancing for a cooperative research and development program in gaseous fuels and their use.\nSwRI is an independent, nonprofit, applied engineering and physical sciences research and\ndevelopment organization.\nIn 1987, GRI contracted with SwRI to develop a world-class Metering Research Facility (MRF)\nwith the objective of improving the state-of-the-art\nin gas flow measurement at field installations.\nThe MR\xc2\xa3 includeshree\nt\nindependent,\nnatural as systems: low-pressure\ng\na\nloop(LPL),a highpressure loop (HPL), and a distribution test stand (DTS).

The MRF is available for third party use to perform\nmetering research and development, equipment calibration and testing, and personnel training.\nThe specifications for the MRF are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe primary mass flow standard for each MRF test system is a gravimctric system that weighs the\ngas collected during a precisely measured time interval.

The claim by the Krohne America was that their "Corimass"\nsystem had\na repeatibility of 0.1% of flowrate and an error of less than 0.2% of the value. The design used\ntorsional stress, not bending stress. Rates are from 0.2 lb/min to 3600 lb/mm. Average cost was\n$5000. The specs were for liquid. According to Warren Ellisin, Krohne America makes variable\narea flowmeters (rotameters) and Coriolis meters for liquids only (6/30/95).\nStork Ultrasonic Technologies,\nInc.; Shelby Morley; 800/795-7512\nShelby Morley thinks his ultrasound meteres may have application m our H2 flow control valve\ntests. Note: these ultrasound meters are not accurate enough for this project.\nDaniel Flow Products, Inc.; Kevin Warner; 713/82%5067\nKevin Warner says ultrasonic meters for gas are less accurate than sonic nozzles (6.23/95).\nEndress and Hauser Instruments (E & H) in Greenwood, IN; 800/428-4344\nMarcel Woiton (a research engineer) said E & H makes Coriolis meters but they only have done\nlimited as testing\ng\nwithCNG. They usually\ncalibrate\nwith waterand assume no change withgas.\nTheirmetermeasuresthephase shift.\nThey havesent catalogs\ntoWSTF.\nGreg Harker, ofE & H, said the M-point model is being replaced by Promass 60/63 models. The\npromass F is for higher temperatures (392F compared to 300F for the Promass M). The cost is\nabout $6500. Delivery is as short as 3 days for a 1-in. Promass M. There are two tubes so the\nsensor can reference motion of one tube with respect to the other; this gives the measurement\nstability. Their velocity limitation is recommended mainly for viscous fluids that would produce\ntoo large of a pressure drop.\nWoiton at E & H said it would cost about $1 million to develop a meter at 5000 psi and 980 F.\nThe 1000/1 turndown refers to the electronics capability. They have a meter now being used for\nCNG at 3600 psi. High-pressure changes require new calibration for a meter. The high-pressure\neffectsto change the internal\ni\ndiameter\n(ID),\nthusthevolume of themeter.\nTherefore, new\na\ncalibration is required. The pressure change does not affect the resonance frequency. The density\ninfluences the resonance frequency. For instance their meter resonates at 1000 Hz in air but at 700\nHz in water. The mass flow is measured by the delta time m the phase shift from inlet to outlet\nsensor.\nAccording to Woiton, the mass flowrate errors at are probably due to sonic effects. They do not\nhave much data to go on for gas, but in liquid a high upstream velocity causes interference in the\nmeter. He recommended a 3/8 in. meter for calibration lab and a I/2 in. meter for the high flow\nfacility. thinks\nHe\nthepressure\ndrop may be toohighathighflowrates install metersin\nto\ntwo\nseries.\nThey want towork withWSTF togetdata.\nThey willsendus a metertotest\nbutI think\nthey\nneed a purchase\norderand thenforus toeithereturn\nr\nthemeteror pay foritifwe aresatisfied.\n\n27-10\n\nSchlumberger-Neptune;\nChandler, Z; Marty Brickner\nA\nSchlumberger makes an omega shape for gas, but they cannot guarantee published accuracy for\ngas. They are quoting liquid accuracy. They are discontinuing their straight pipe version, which\nwas used only for liquids.\nBailey-Fischer\n\n& Porter;\n\nWe have been unable to get the technical people here to talk to us to date (6.30/95 to 8/3/95).\nThe Direct Measurement Co. (DMC) in Longmont, CO; Dave Hahn\nWithin the last year, the Direct Measurement Corporation (DMC) has marketed a "radial mode\nmeter" specifically for gaseous flow. The flow sensor is a single straight tube as opposed to the\nbent tubes found m most Coriolis flowmeters. The vibration is in the radial mode as opposed to the\nbending mode or torsional mode. Also, this arrangement can achieve higher frequencies (5000 Hz)\nthan the bending mode. They claim 0.5% accuracy of the rate plus 0.025% at the upper range\nlimit. Meters are available for 0 to 60,000 or 0 to 240,000 lbs/hr.\nDave Hahn discussed\n\nobtaining their 1-in. meter to test in our Calibration Lab. He said the\n\nproblem is fleeing up a meter. He expressed some concern about publicizing the results\nparticularly at certain flowrates or in liquid. I f\'axed three proposed test matrices for his inspection.\nOne was for Brooks Prover, another for Cox Sonic Nozzles, and the third was for liquid\ncalibrations (7/5/95). He said they intend to test at SwiLl when SwRI finishes with another\ncustomer. I mentioned\n\nwe may cost share to get data. He seemed agreeable\n\n(7/8/95).\n\nDon Cage it would take 10 weeks to deliver a 1-in. meter. I have a feeling it will be longer.\nHahn said their prototype 4000 psi meter is chromoly.\n\nThere may be a provision for a one-time\n\noverpressure in the code B31.3 so that we could place it upstream of the FCV in Hydrogen flow\nfacility. He has only investigated density and mass flow as opposed to effects of other variables\nand parameters. Angular velocity is function of frequency and geometry only. In the Coriolis force\nequation (F_=2mc0xV), "m" is point mass, not mass flow. Therefore the "m" is unknown.\nFoxboro\n\nCo. (Foxboro,\n\nMA); Carl Annromo\n\nFoxboro Co. stated accuracy for their I/A series mass flowmeters is 0.2% over the top 90% of the\nentire range but only for liquids.\nCarl Annromo\n\nhas Coriolis experience\n\ntesting a DMC meter at CEESI. He said Coriolis meters\n\nare just not made for gases because electronics are tuned for liquid flow ranges. We will be lucky\nto get 1% accuracy for gas flow in the DMC meter. Foxboro and other companies besides DMC\nonly make them for liquids.\nJim Vignos (R&D at Foxboro: 508/549-2065)\n\nrecommends\n\nVortex meters no. 83F or 83D.\n\nThe F-series is purely analog 4-20 mA output or pulse ouput; The D-series is a digital 4-20 mA or\na total output, not flowrate. They come m flange or wafer. Specs are 1% in gas but 0.5% accuracy\ncan be achieved. They just cannot calibrate that accurately.

However, within certain limitations, some tests such as the CEESI testing of the\nDMC meter in air show uncertainties of less than 0.25%. The recommended approach here is to\nuncover the sources of error and the candidate meter limitations so that it is designed, sized, and\nused appropriately. Velocity, pressure, Mach number, and Reynolds number as well as flowrate\nare suspected limiting variables.\nAn example of the test matrix for pure methane is shown in the Appendix. The idea is to identify\nthe GH2 conditions, as shown in the first section of the table, used in the FCV tests. The following\nsections in the table will correlate relevant parameters for CNG, that will be used at the SwRI, or\nGN2, that will be used at the WSTF Flow Calibration\n\nlaboratory.\n\nThe values in the table were\n\ncomputed based on _deal gas properties of hydrogen and methane. More accurate test matrices need\nto be developed based on real gas properties of the CNG mixture used at SwRI as the project\nprogresses.\n\n27-14\n\nREFERENCES\nBabb,\n\nMichael,\n\n"Simplicity\n\nEngineering,\nBlickley,\n\nGeorge,\nMay,\n\nBlickley,\n\n\'Tlowmeter\n\nGeorge,\n\n"Mass\n\nCenter,\n\nObtained\n\nTechnology,"\n\nby Design,"\n\nby Coriolis\n\nMeasures\n\nControl\n\nControl\n\nEngineering,\n\nMethods,"\n\nMass Flow\n\nControl\n\nPropulsion\n\nAL, May,\n\nDirectly,"\n\nand Air in Critical Flow Nozzles,\n\nwith Air and Hydrogen,"\nTechnology,\n\nPart 2:\n\n1994 conference\n\nNASA/Marshall\n\non\n\nSpace\n\nFlight\n\n1994.\n\nof the Use ofa\n\nCalibrated\n\nin Liquid,"\n\nCoriolis\n\nA WSTF\n\nMass\n\nFlow\n\nFlowrneter\n\nCalibration\n\nas a Gas\n\nCalibration\n\nLaboratory\n\ninternal\n\n1992\n\nD., "Choices\n\nGenesi,\n\nD., "Flowmeters\n\nAbound\n\nTechnology\n\n& Hauser\n\nin the Metering\n\nverification,"\n\nEngineering,\nMeasures\n\nSymposium,\n\n"Direct\n\nand Hauser\n\nMeasurement\n\nAG), "Behavior\n\nPublication):\n\n27-15\n\nApril,\n\n1991\n\n1991\n\nFlow of Gas,"\n\nof Straight\n\npredications\n\nFluidFlow\n\nPipe Coriolis\n\nMass\n\nwith experimental\n\nvol. 5, no. 4, 1994\n\nAG Flow\nof Mass\n\nEngineering,\n\n1994\n\nof Gas: theoretical\n\nP., (FLOWTECH\n\nMay,\n\nMass\n\nMarc, and Blazek, Christopher,\nFueling Dispenser\nApplications,"\n\nB. and Txchabold,\n(Endress\n\nFlowtec\n\nChemical\n\nFlow Measurementlnstrumentation,\n\nPatricia, Butler,\nMeters for NGV\n1994.\n\nSwitzerland),\n\nDirectly\n\n3rd lnternational\n\n(Endress\n\nflowmeters\n\nin Flow Measurement,"\n\non Tap," Chemical\n\nDavid T., "New\nMeasurement\n\nVogtlin,\n\nAided\n\n"Coriolis Flowmeter\nJan., 1990\n\n"A Study\n\nGenesi,\n\nRowley,\n\nMeasurement\n\nEarth-to-Orbit\n\nStandard\n\nN.M.\n\nof Coriolis\n\nMaintained\n\nof Hydrogen\n\nResults\n\nHuntsville,\n\nBrandon,\nreport,\n\nKeita,\n\nCost\n\n1990:\n\nGary, "Correlation\n\nAdvanced\n\nHahn,\n\nFlow\n\nApril,\n\ncalibration\n\nGabel,\n\nCalibration\n\nEngineering\nEditors,\nControl Engineering,\n\nCorpron,\n\nReduces\n\n1992:\n\n1990:\n\nEngineering,\nControl\n\nof Design\n\nSeptember,\n\nFlow\n\n"Evaluation\nof Mass\nNatural Gas Fuels,\n\nMeasurement,\n\nFlow\nAugust,\n\nReinach,\n\nUsing the Coriolis\n\nForce,"\n\n"\xc2\xb0 \xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\n\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\n\n\'\'ii iii\nii\n\nU\n\nU\n0\n\nU\n0\n\n'
