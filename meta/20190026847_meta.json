Pulse position modulation is the modulation format of choice for deep space applications, and by inserting inter-symbol guard times between the symbols, the signal carries the timing information needed by the demodulator. Accurately extracting this timing information is crucial to demodulating and decoding this signal. In this paper we propose a low complexity maximum likelihood timing estimator for pulse position modulation with inter-symbol guard times which significantly outperforms the prior art in this domain. We show that this estimator can achieve the same performance as prior estimators with an order-of-magnitude less signal flux, or multiple orders-of-magnitude less flux-accumulation time. Further we show that this estimator achieves the Cramer-Rao bound, making it asymptotically efficient. This method does not require an explicit synchronization sequence, freeing up channel resources for data transmission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190026847, "endDate": "2016-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "229b8ca04cae419fa4884e60a850aa01", "id": "5ac64fbfbd7f435c9f99a3023add7db1"}], "name": "IEEE Global Communications Conference (Globecom 2016)", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "229b8ca04cae419fa4884e60a850aa01", "startDate": "2016-12-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190026847, "id": "357b6adee8284017ab65d0012d41dcd3", "publicationDate": "2016-12-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
