From the total budget of $5,000, Tricia and I studied the problem domain for developing ail Engine Condition Monitoring system using the sparse and non-standardized datasets to be available through a consortium at NASA Lewis Research Center. We visited NASA three times to discuss additional issues related to dataset which was not made available to us. We discussed and developed a general framework of data mining and optimization tools to extract useful information from sparse and non-standard datasets. These discussions lead to the training of Tricia Erhardt to develop Genetic Algorithm based search programs which were written in C++ and used to demonstrate the capability of GA algorithm in searching an optimal solution in noisy datasets. From the study and discussion with NASA LERC personnel, we then prepared a proposal, which is being submitted to NASA for future work for the development of data mining algorithms for engine conditional monitoring. The proposed set of algorithm uses wavelet processing for creating multi-resolution pyramid of the data for GA based multi-resolution optimal search. Wavelet processing is proposed to create a coarse resolution representation of data providing two advantages in GA based search: 1. We will have less data to begin with to make search sub-spaces. 2. It will have robustness against the noise because at every level of wavelet based decomposition, we will be decomposing the signal into low pass and high pass filters.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990089300, "id": "308effd497ff47da90ffa815d455d90f", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990089300.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990089300/downloads/19990089300.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990089300/downloads/19990089300.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990089300/downloads/19990089300.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
