ABSTRACT\nIn large complex structures, with several major sound\ntransmission paths and high levels of background noise, it can be\na complex task to locate and rank the contribution of an indivi\ndual sound transmission path. In this paper the two-microphone\nacoustic intensity techniques as a tout for path identification\nwas experimentally investigated. Laboratory tests conducted on\nthe fuselage of a light aircraft indicate that, if the intensity\ntransmitted through a particular section of the fuselage is measured in the presence and absence of flanking paths using the\nface-to-face and side-by-side microphone arrangements, then no\nsignificant difference exists between the two measured intensities if the face-to-face microphone arrangement is used. However, if the side-by-side arrangement is used, then considerable\ndifference exists between the two measured intensities. Com parison of the two microphone arrangements in the absence of\nflanking, but presence of increasing background noise suggests\nthat, if the sound field is very reactive then error is introduced into the measured intensity. However, the magnitude of the\nerror is similar in both arrangements.\n\nL_ .r\n\nk\n\n\t\n\na\nIs^\t\n\n-22. INTRODUCTION\nA common step in solving any noise control problem is to\nidentify and characterize which one of the several source/path is\nthe one that dominates. Knowing the noise contribution of each\nsource/path can often lead to a quick, logical and direct\napproach in developing noise control techniques. Sound pressure\nlevel measurements in the presence of various source/path does\nnot provide any information concerning the amount and direction\nof the acoustic energy flow and as such cannot be used to rank\nthe contribution of any individual source/path. Hence, the basic\n\nprinciple employed in traditional source/path identification\ntechniques is to artificially quieten or eliminate other\nsources/paths, except the one under investigation and each\nsource/path is returned to its natural state, with others\n\n"silenced" to complete the source/path analyses. The eliminating\nand quietening of other sources/paths can be achieved by disconnecting the noisy sources or by lead wrapping. These methods can\nbe very expensive and time consuming when dealing with structures\n\nof the size of a light aircraft. Also, due to the poor transmission loss of lead at low frequencies, such wrapping techniques\nare often not very successful.\nA possible solution to this ranking problem is to measure\nthe acoustic intensity vector, which describes the net flow of\nacoustic energy. The concept of measuring the acoustic intensity\nis not new, the theoretical background has been available since\n1932. However, until the advent of real time fast fourier\n\nOJ\n\n- 3 e\ntransform (FFT) based analyzers in recent years, the technique\nwas not practical. The most commonly used method of measuring\nthe acoustic intensity is based on finite difference approximation and the intensity is calculated from the imaginary part of\nthe cross spectrum between two closely spaced microphones. The\nsuccessful application of the cross-spectral formula based on\nfinite difference approximations is subject to low and high frequency limits dictated by the effective microphone separation\ndistance. Other errors associated with the technique include\nphase mismatch between the two microphone systems, scattering of\nthe sound by the microphones and the shadowing effect of one\nmicrophone on the other.\n\nA major part of this report will be presented at the 1984\nInternational Conference on Noise Control Engineering to be held\nin Hawaii in December.\n\n3. MICROPHONE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nAlthough four possible microphone configurations shown in\nFig. 1 have been suggested for measuring the acoustic intensity,\nonly two., the side-by-side and face-to-face are primarily used.\nShadowing of one microphone by the other and small microphone\nspacings are major drawbacks in the case of back-to-back and\nstaggered configurations. The major advantages of using the\nside-by-side arrangement are that one can sweep close to the\n\xc2\xa3"\t\n\nradiating surface and conventional spherical windscreens can be\n\no\n\n\t\nLa\n\n-\n\n4 -\n\nused when the fluid has mean flow, however, the microphone spac-\n\nI\n\ning is limited by the size of the microphones. Small separation\ndistance necessarily for high frequency measurements are easily\nobtainable in the face-to-face configuration. The main disadvantage of this configuration is that the incidence angles as shown\nin Fig. 2 are different for the two microphones; 0 0 for the\nsecond microphone and 180 0 for the first. As a consequence the\nscattering effects of the two microphones are different. To\novercome this problem, a solid cylindrical spacer is inserted\nbetween the two microphone grids as shown in Fig. 2. The\ncylindrical spacer produces a small volume between the spacer and\nthe diaphragm of each microphone. This volume is acoustically\ncoupled to the sound field via the slits in the microphone grid.\nThus the incident sound field activates the diaphragm only via\nthe peripheral slits.\n\n4. ACOUSTIC INTENSITY MEASUREMENTS\n\nIn practical situations acoustic intensity measurements are\ngenerally made by sweeping the microphone array over the radiating surface to get a space and time averaged intensity. In the\npast three years several researchers have begun to apply the\nacoustic intensity technique to noise transmission problems in\naircrafts with considerable success (1,2). However, since the\nLW\t\n\nacoustic intensity is calculated from the pressure measured by\nthe two microphones, in many practical situations where high\n\n`:..\namounts of background noise is present, the use of the technique\n\nO.\n\nE\n\n-WIM \t\n\n_\n\n5 -\n\nis limited. Crocker, Heitman and Wang (3) presented the results\nof a laboratory :study on the transmission of sound through four\nareas of an airplane fuselage sidewall using the side-by-side two\nmicrophone intensity configuration. Part of their study suggested that if there are strong flanking paths present, inaccurate estimates can be obtained of the sound transmitted by the\nprimary sound transmission path, thus further limiting the "in\nsitu" use of this technique. However, their study indicates that\nif fairly simple precautions are taken to suppress background\nnoise and strong flanking paths than the technique can be highly\nsuccessful in predicting the sound transmission characteristics\nof aircraft.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to present and discuss some\nexperimental results on the validity of the two microphone\nacoustical intensity data in noise path identification. The data\nwas taken in the presence of various flanking paths and increasing amounts of background noise using the side-by-side and faceto-face microphone configuration. It\'s important to assess the\napplication of the two-microphone acoustic intensity technique\nunder such "real life" situations if this technique is to be used\nfor "in situ" measurements.\n\n5. EFFECT OF FLANKING PATHS\n1,M \'\nThe fuselage of a small single engine Piper Cherokee air\t was the subject of the first set of results presented in\nr-\n\nC\n- 6 -\n\nthis study. The fuselage was suspended in a semi-anechoic\nchamber from three points. The chamber itself is 12.5 x 8.2 x\n5.5 m and has concrete floors. Fiberglass sheets were placed\nbeneath the fuselage, to make the environment essentially\nanechoic. Four areas of the starboard fuselage sidewall were\nchosen for the flanking path studies. The four areas are shown\nin Fig. 3 and include two plexiglass windows and two aluminum\npanels with standard trim. one of two plexiglass window was part\nof the door unit, while the other was a passenger window behind\nthe door. Similarly one of the aluminum ^anels was \'Located\nbeneath the back passenger window. Foi ease cf reference the\nareas under study have been numbered as shown in Fig. 3. A 25.4\nthick sheet of plywood with a 50.8 mm thick sheet of fiberglass\nattached separated the cabin from the back of the fuselage and\nall tests were performed with this construction in place. A\npneumatic driver with a rectangular horn attached was used as the\nsound source and was located directly opposite the center of the\nrear window (panel 1) as indicated in Fig. 4.\nThe acoustic intensity transmitted was measured in the presence and absence of flanking paths using the two different microphone arrangements, namely side-by-side and face-to-face. For\nexample, with the sound source located directly in front of the\nrear window the intensity transmitted through panel 4 was measured. In this situation, panels 1, 2, and 3 will act as flanking\npaths, with panels 1 and 3 being strong flanking paths because of\ntheir low transmission loss and the source location. The flanking\n\nE\'\n\n.\n\n.rte -0 .- R =:\t\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n---_ _^\n\nr.\n\n-7paths were than avoided by covering panels 1, 2 and 3 with\ntwo sheets of lead vinyl (3.7 kg/m 2 ) such that the transmission\nloss of these panels was relatively much higher than the panel\nunder study and the intensity transmitted through panel 4 was\nremeasured. If the effect of flanking on the microphone configuration is negligible than the effect of covering panels 1, 2,\nand 3 should not change the measured value of the intensity\ntransmitted through panel 4, provided the interior surface of\nthis panel can be assumed non absorbing. Similar tests were also\nconducted\'on panel 3 with panels 1, 2 and 4 ,acting as flanking\npaths. In this situation, panel 1 will be a major flanking path\nbecause of the source location and panels 2 and 4 were not considered as flanking paths because of their high transmission loss\nand location relative to the source. However, all three panels\nwere covered with two sheets of lead vinyl when the blocked\nflanking path measurements were made.\nHalf inch phase matched Bruel and Kjaer (B&K) pair of freefield microphones mounted on 1/4"-diameter B&K microphone preamplifiers were used in this study. For the side-by-side configuration, the two microphones were supported by clamping the\npreamplifiers between two small pieces of rectangular poly-glass.\nCare was taken to position the clamping device far away as possible from the measurement point. For the face-to-face configuration, a special probe manufactured by B&K with a solid spacer was\nused. A dual channel FFT was used for the intensity calculations. The data was recorded as narrow 10 Hz bandwidth measurements. With the help of a specially written fortran program, it\n&\n\nO\n\n- 8 to\n\nwas possible to convert the data into one - third octaves band\nintensity levels. A reasonable amount of fiberglass was placed\n\ninside the aircraft to make the interior reasonably anechoic and\nall exterior parts of the fuselage except the four areas under\nstudy were covered with at least two sheets of lead vinyl to\nprevent sound entering the fuselage through other areas. Care\n\nwas taken to avoid any exterior and interior fuselage and source\nlocation changes from one set of measurements to the next. Possible errors due to signal processing and FFT techniques were also\n\navoided.\nFigures 5 and 6 show the effect on the intensity transmitted\nby panel 4 of flanking paths 1, 2, and 3, measured using the\nside-by - side and face-to-face microphone arrangement respectively. Figure 5 for the side-by-side arrangement shows little\neffect of flanking up to about 500 Hz, above this frequency the\ntwo curves begin to diverge, the measured intensity being higher\nfor the case of unblocked flanking paths than that found with\nblocked flanking paths. The divergence of the two curves is\nprobably because at low frequencies all four panels under study\nwill have similar transmission loss characteristics, however, at\nhigh frequencies the transmission of sound through the windows\nwill be much higher because of their comparatively low transmission loss. Thus the higher amounts of intensity transmitted by\nthe windows will contaminate the measured intensity transmitted\nby the panel under investigation. The pattern is different when\n\ns h ^ -pis-\xe2\x80\xa2 ^ - ^ ^- ,.\n\n(i)\n\n- 9 the intensity transmitted under similar conditions is Measured\nusing the face - to-face arrangement, Fig. 6. In this case, a\nrelatively small difference is observed between blocked and\nunblocked flanking paths. Also if the face - to-face curves are\ncompared with the blocked flanking side - by-side curve, fairly\ngood comparison is observed in all but one band, indicating that\neven when flanking is present, the face-to - face arrangement can\nmeasure the intensity transmitted fairly accurately.\n\nA less dramatic flanking effect on the side-by - side arrange-\n\nment is seen in Fig. 7, where the intensity transmitted by the\ndoor window ( Panel 3) was measured in the presence and absence of\n\nflanking. Once again at high frequencies the two curves begin to\ndiverge. As before, little difference between the two sets of\ndata obtained using the face-to-face arrangement (Fig. 8) is\nobserved. Also if the face-to - face curves are compared with the\nblocked flanking side-by-side curve, fairly good agreement is\n\nobserved.\n\n6. EFFECT OF BACKGROUND NOISE\nThe second set of tests to compare the two microphone\narrangements were conducted using the set-up shown in Fig. 9,\narranged is the semi-anechoic chamber. The arrangement consists\nof a fairly reverberant 1.2 M x 1.3 M x 1.8 M wooden box, with a\n1.2 M x 1.2 M opening. This box on occasions has been used in\n-\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nthe Herrick Laboratories as the acoustically hard receiving room\n\ni\n\ns^rr _-0\n\nA\n\n- 10 in the transmission suite transmission loss measurement technique. A 1/8" thick steel panel with a .3 M x .45 M plexiglass\nwindow was sealed to the opening. A large Altec speaker positioned directly in front of the panel was used as a sound source.\nThe space time averaged intensity transmitted by the plexiglass\nwindow was measured using the side-by-side and face-to-face\nmicrophone arrangements under various interior background noise\nconditions. The interior background noise conditions were varied\nby placing different amounts of fiberglass in the box. Four such\nconditions were studied. These included; anechoic, semianechoic, reverberant and noisy. In the case of the anechoic\ncondition wedges of fiberglass similar to those commonly used in\nanechoic chambers were placed against the side and rear walls of\nthe box and some fiberglass was also placed on the floor. For\nthe semi-anechoic condition fiberglass wedges were placed only\nagainst the rear wall. The reverberant condition was r,chieved by\nremoving all the fiberglass from the box and finally the noisy\ncondition was achieved by introducing a high frequency sound\nsource \xc2\xb1nto the empty box.\nFigure 10 thru 13 show the effect of increasing the background noise on the intensity transmitted measured using \t\n\nje\n\nside-by-side and face-to-face microphone arrangements. Intensity\ntransmitted measured under anechoic -onditions (Fig. 11) was considered as the actual intensity being transmitted through the\nplexiglass window and the intensity measured under other conditions were compared with the actual intensity to evaluate the\n\nk\n\n4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\neffect of background noise conditions. Along with the measured\nintensity, the difference between the measured and actual intensity is also plotted in Figs. 11, 12, and 13. As can be seen in\nthese figures, regardless of the background noise condition both\nthe face-to-face and the side-by-side arrangements measure the\nsame intensity, unlike the last section.\nFigures 11 and 12 show that under semi-anechoic and even\nreverberant background fairly accurate estimates of the transmitted acoustic intensity can be obtained. There is an error of\nabout 3 dB in 3 one-third octane bands at low frequencies in the\ncase of the reverberant field. Otherwise, the conditions of the\ndata are fairly good. Finally, in the case of noisy background\ncondition (Fig. 13) both arrangements over estimate the transmitted acoustic intensity by more than lr, dB in c.rta{n frequency\nbands. Although this discrepancy was to be expected, the ultimate aim of this particular test was to see if one of the\narrangements would give better results than the other in a highly\nnoisy environment.\n\n7. CONCLUSION\nMeasurement of the sound power radiated into an enclosure in\nthe presence of flanking paths and background noise can be an\nexpensive and time consuming task if conventional measurement\ntechniques are used. The results of experimental investigations\nin this paper clearly show that the two microphone acoustic\n\n3.\n\n- 12 K.\n\nintensity approach can be utilized successfully to estimate the\nintensity transmitted into an enclosure even in the presence of\nflanking paths and fairly reverberant background conditions.\nComparison of the side-by-side and face-to-face microphone\narrangements suggests that when measurements are taken in the\npresence of flanking paths than the face-to-face arrangement\nshould be used, however, if the side-by-side arrangement is to be\nused than flanking paths must be blocked.\n\nM\n\n- 13 N\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n8.
