Some of the events that have influenced this growth are reviewed in this paper. This review will include some events prior to World War I; the influence of the war itself; the events during the post-war years including the establishment of aeronautical research laboratories; and the influence of World War II which, among other things, introduced new technologies that included rocket and jet propulsion and supersonic aerodynamics. The subsequent era of aeronautical research and the attendant growth in aviation over the past half century will be reviewed from the view point of the author who, since 1944, has been involved in the NACA/NASA aeronautical research effort at what is now the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The review will discuss some of the research programs related to the development of some experimental aircraft, the Century series of fighter aircraft, multi-mission aircraft, advanced military aircraft and missiles, advanced civil aircraft, supersonic transports, spacecraft and others.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030001006, "endDate": "2002-01-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "0ef27464197949a983edeaa579748f88", "id": "c5a1e3391c0646d28d4a8d8c7054e5f5"}], "name": "40th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "0ef27464197949a983edeaa579748f88", "startDate": "2002-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030001006, "id": "8c68328460d447e29b0fe57c5dd4e6b3", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030001006.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030001006/downloads/20030001006.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030001006/downloads/20030001006.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030001006/downloads/20030001006.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
