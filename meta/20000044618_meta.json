This team is responsible for the development of a broad range of technologies for improved aerodynamic performance and stability and control characteristics at subsonic to supersonic flight conditions. These objectives are pursued through the aggressive use of advanced experimental test techniques and state of the art computational methods. As the HSR program matures and transitions into the next phase the objectives of the Configuration Aerodynamics ITD are being refined to address the drag reduction needs and stability and control requirements of High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) aircraft. In addition, the experimental and computational tools are being refined and improved to meet these challenges. The presentation will review the work performed within the Configuration Aerodynamics element in 1994 and 1995 and then discuss the plans for the 1996-1998 time period. The final portion of the presentation will review several observations of the HSR program and the design activity within Configuration Aerodynamics.", "title": "Configuration Aerodynamics: Past - Present - Future", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T14:41:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000044618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wood, Richard M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA United States"}}, "id": "37ecfc50113244fdafb5329055f4c0b9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000044618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Agrawal, Shreekant"}, "organization": {"name": "McDonnell-Douglas Aerospace", "location": "Long Beach, CA United States"}}, "id": "f0f44ab4291b49daabad3b7818c09a23"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20000044618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bencze, Daniel P."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "c4fdebbcfa954e57ba0f7d0022791b5e"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 20000044618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kulfan, Robert M."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA United States"}}, "id": "760169d5032d4eed8e65867843354547"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 20000044618, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilson, Douglas L."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.", "location": "Seattle, WA United States"}}, "id": "5b1aa0ddea62491697b8dba800e96e82"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000044618, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000044618, "issue": "Part 1", "id": "a82f56cb74f64097876293f1ef067cd4", "publicationName": "First NASA/Industry High-Speed Research Configuration Aerodynamics Workshop", "publicationDate": "1999-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20000044616, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "First NASA/Industry High-Speed Research Configuration Aerodynamics Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000044618.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000044618/downloads/20000044618.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000044618/downloads/20000044618.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000044618/downloads/20000044618.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
