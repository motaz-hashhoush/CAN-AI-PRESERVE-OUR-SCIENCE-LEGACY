b'Electronics/Computers\nPrinted Microinductors for Flexible Substrates\nMagnetic composite layers are combined with hermetic coatings to optimize electrical and\nmechanical properties.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method of fabricating planar, flexible\nmicroinductors that exhibit a relatively\nhigh quality factor (Q) between 1 and 10\nMHz has been devised. These inductors\nare targeted for use in flexible, low-profile\npower-converter circuits. They could also\nbe incorporated into electronic circuits\nintegrated into flexible structures, including flexible antenna and solar-sail structures that are deployable.\nFabrication of inductors on flexible,\nheat-sensitive substrates is typically limited by the need for high-temperature\nannealing step of the magnetic material.\nHighly loaded ceramic/polymer composite films can be seen printed and\ncured at lower temperatures, but suffer\n\nA Flexible Inductor of Three Layers is\nthick-film processing techniques.\n\npoor adhesion. Thus, a new approach is\nrequired to enable the fabrication of\nhigh Q inductors (for power applications) on the flex substrates.\nThe microinductor comprises a planar\nspiral metal coil and a high-permeability\nmagnetic thick-film (equivalent to the\ncore of a conventional inductor) in the\nform of a ceramic/polymer composite.\nThe metal spiral is fabricated by photolithography and etching of a copperclad flexible polyamide substrate. The ceramic/polymer composite is deposited by\nstencil and screen printing, both above\nand below the metal spiral (see figure).\nTo obtain sufficient permeance and volume magnetization for the required degree of enhancement of inductance,\nUpper Ceramic/Polymer\nthe mass fraction of\nComposite Layer\nthe ceramic in the ceramic/polymer composite must be about\n95 percent, which is\nMetal Coil\ngreater than the\nmass fractions of\nfillers typically incorporated into polymer-matrix\nthick\nFlexible Substrate\nfilms.

These adverse effects can be overcome, to a degree\nthat makes it possible to produce an inductor of both acceptably high Q and acceptable mechanical properties, by (1)\nproper choice of the polymer resin and\nthe ceramic magnetic powder filler for the\nthick-film formulation, in conjunction\nwith (2) the use of a hermetic-coating\ntechnique.\nOf the resins tested, polyester resins\ndemonstrated the best loading and adhesion characteristics.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA series-connected buck boost regulator (SCBBR) is an electronic circuit that\nbucks a power-supply voltage to a lower\nregulated value or boosts it to a higher\nregulated value. The concept of the\nSCBBR is a generalization of the con-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, February 2005\n\ncept of the SCBR, which was reported in\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeries-Connected Boost Regulators\xe2\x80\x9d\n(LEW-15918), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 23,\nNo. 7 (July 1997), page 42. Relative to\nprior DC-voltage-regulator concepts, the\nSCBBR concept can yield significant re-\n\nductions in weight and increases in\npower-conversion efficiency in many applications in which input/output voltage\nratios are relatively small and isolation is\nnot required, as solar-array regulation or\nbattery charging with DC-bus regulation.\n\n11\n\nEfficiency\n\n1.00\n\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nOutput Voltage \xc3\xb7 Input Voltage\n\nFigure 1.

In a Basic SCBBR, the input side of a DC-to-DC converter is connected across the input power\nbus, while the output side is connected in series with the input power bus.\n\nUsually, a DC voltage regulator is designed to include a DC-to-DC converter\nto reduce its power loss, size, and weight.\nAdvances in components, increases in\noperating frequencies, and improved circuit topologies have led to continual increases in efficiency and/or decreases in\nthe sizes and weights of DC voltage regulators. The primary source of inefficiency\nin the DC-to-DC converter portion of a\nvoltage regulator is the conduction loss\nand, especially at high frequencies, the\nswitching loss. Although improved components and topology can reduce the\nswitching loss, the reduction is limited by\nthe fact that the converter generally\nswitches all the power being regulated.\nLike the SCBR concept, the SCBBR concept involves a circuit configuration in\nwhich only a fraction of the power is\nswitched, so that the switching loss is reduced by an amount that is largely independent of the specific components and\ncircuit topology used. In an SCBBR, the\namount of power switched by the DC-toDC converter is only the amount needed\nto make up the difference between the\n\n12\n\ninput and output bus voltage. The remaiing majority of the power passes through\nthe converter without being switched.\nThe weight and power loss of a DC-toDC converter are determined primarily\nby the amount of power processed. In\nthe SCBBR, the unswitched majority of\nthe power is passed through with very little power loss, and little if any increase\nin the sizes of the converter components\nis needed to enable the components to\nhandle the unswitched power. As a result, the power-conversion efficiency of\nthe regulator can be very high, as shown\nin the example of Figure 1.\nA basic SCBBR includes a DC-to-DC\nconverter (see Figure 2). The switches\nand primary winding of a transformer in\nthe converter is connected across the\ninput bus, while the secondary winding\nand switches are connected in series with\nthe output bus, so that the output voltage\nis the sum of the input voltage and the\nsecondary voltage of the converter.\nIn the breadboard SCBBR, the input\nvoltage applied to the primary winding\nis switched by use of metal oxide/semi-\n\nconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in a full bridge circuit; the secondary winding is center-tapped, with\ntwo MOSFET switches and diode rectifiers connected in opposed series in\neach leg. The sets of opposed switches\nand rectifiers are what enable operation\nin either a boost or a buck mode. In the\nboost mode, input voltage and current,\nand the output voltage and current are\nall positive; that is, the secondary voltage\nis added to the input voltage and the net\noutput voltage can be regulated at a\nvalue equal or greater than the input\nvoltage. In the buck mode, input voltage\nis still positive and the current still flows\nin the same direction in the secondary,\nbut the switches are controlled such that\nsome power flows from the secondary to\nthe primary. The voltage across the secondary and the current into the primary\nare reversed. The result is that the output\nvoltage is lower than the input voltage,\nand some power is recirculated from the\nconverter secondary back to the input.\nQuantitatively, the advantage of an\nSCBBR is a direct function of the regulation range required. If, for example, a\nregulation range of \xc2\xb120 percent is required for a 500-W supply, then it suffices\nto design the DC-to-DC converter in the\nSCBBR for a power rating of only 100 W.\nThe switching loss and size are much\nsmaller than those of a conventional regulator that must be rated for switching\nof all 500 W. The reduction in size and\nthe increase in efficiency are not directly\nproportional to switched-power ratio of\n5:1 because the additional switches contribute some conduction loss and the\ninput and output filters must be larger\nthan those typically required for a 100-W\nconverter. Nevertheless, the power loss\nand the size can be much smaller than\nthose of a 500-W converter.\nBecause with slight additions the\nSCBBR can also function as a conventional buck-mode switching regulator, it\ncan provide current-limited turn-on,\nprotection against overcurrent, and bus\nswitching. Finally, it should be noted\nthat although the breadboard SCBBR\ndesign utilizes hard switching, resonant\nand soft-switching configurations should\nbe viable as alternatives.\nThis work was done by Arthur G. Birchenough\nof Glenn Research Center.
