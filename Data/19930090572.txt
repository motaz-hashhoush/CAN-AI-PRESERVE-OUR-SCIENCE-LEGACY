While working onthe\nletter, he was impressed with the idea that the future of commercial ;.rarine aviation would depend on the realization of powerful sealanes ca p able of breasting the sea, and that it was imp ortant to develop the new type of flying boat so as to afford\nthe maximum degree of safety both in the air and on the water.\nAt that time, when construction was just beginning to free\nitself from the em-pirical rules to which it had hitherto been\nsubject, he resolved to tackle the problem in its most general\ntheoretical form. He sought to discover at the outset the maximum performance carrying capacity and radius of action of a\nlarge seaplane.\nIn collaboration with his brother Maurice, he established\nthe laws of similitude for airplanes, a work which is now classic\nand which was the subject of a conunication by its authors to\nthe first International Congress of Aerial Navigation, and of\nvarious Dublished. articles. These articles served as the basis\n*Fromm"Bulletin de la Chambre Syndicale des Industries .A\xc3\xa9ronautiques , u September-December, 1926, pp. 1-17.\n\n\t\n\nN.A.C.A.

The trim of the\nseaDlane on the water is assured by two wing floats, one on each\nside of the hull, 9 m (29.53 ft.) from .its axis.\nWing.- This has an area of 270 m 2 (2906 sq.ft.), an aspect\nratio of 6, and comprises three sections: a rectangular central\nsection having a uniform cross section or profile and a span of\n13. m (44.29 ft.), and two symmetrical trapezoidal sections\nwith variable profiles, each section having a span of 13.125 m\n(43.06 ft.), the chords being, respectively, 9 rn and 5 m (29.53\nft. and 16.4 ft.). It has a lateral dihedral with slopes of\n0.095 to the horizontal. The profile was derived from the Eiffel\n391 and is of diminishing thickness, 20% at the junction points,\n12 a at the tips.\n\nNAC.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35\n\n\t\n\n4\n\nThe wing structure consists of longitudinal and transvers\nmembers. Among the former, there are the four patented main\nspars of the Vierendeel box- irder typ e. The spruce flanRes,\ninforced with high-resistance steel wires having a breaking\nstrength of 180 kg/mm2 (256 1 000 lb./sq.in .), are joined to the\nturned and glued upright reinforcing ribs of ash by webs of\nbirch lywood reinforced externally and stiffened internal1y\nAmong the 1atteT 5 there are 22 main ribs composed of triangular girders of high-resistance steel with a breaking strength\nof 75 kg/mm2 0-06,675 lb./sq.in .), which join the spars solidly\nto each other and support the two false spars, the auxiliary\ns p ars and the ailerons. In the central wing section, eight of\nthe main ribs are extended forward and terminated with a frame\nto which the engine su pp orts are attached. The horizontal transverse bracing of the whole consists of two groups of highresistance steel wires plac. ed. along the top and bottom of the\nwing.\nThe sha p e of the p rofile is given by I-shaped wood ribs\nwith spruce flanges and openwork plywood webs supported in part\nby the spars and false spars and, in part by the auxiliary spars\ndistributed along the wing chord in such manner that the maximum\nintervals between the intermediate ribs are 0.75.m (2.46 ft.).\nThe latter are covered in front with plywood 1.5 cm (0.59 in.)\nthick, judiciously stiffened in front, thus forming a light rigid leading edge.\n\n5\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35\t\n\nThe covering consists of doped-and enameled. fabric. In order, however, to reduce the cost of upkeep and the danger of\nfire, the front portions of the;ing n\n\near the engines are coy-\n\nered with thin sheet duraii\'.min ribbed and corrugated.\nThe whole trailing edge is terminated. by the ailerons, consisting of trianRular girders completely covered vith plywood\nand hil-iged to the false r1r soar in the vicinity o f the main\nribs by bail hearings.\nHull.- This has a length of 26 in (8\'5.3 ft . ), a maximum\nwidth of 3.8\n\nin\n\n(12.47 ft.) and a height of 4\n\nin\n\n(13.12 ft.).\n\nIt has \t single open and easily replaceable step, -.Those edge is\n0.75\n\nin\n\n(2.46 ft.) behind the center of gravity. Its double bot-\n\ntom consists of eight compartments separated from one another\nby water-tight partitions of special rubberized. fabric.\nIts simple lines were designed from both the hydrodynamio\nand aerodynamic viewpoints. Its trim on the water is\n\n30 nose-\n\nup, which assures an easy and quick take-off. It is sha p ed like\na. boat as to bow and keel, and like a. fuselage as to its upper\nand rear portions. The double-curved bottom has a decided Vshape culminating at . the steps\nIt has a triple riveted covering of spruce, mahogany and\nteak, of variable thickness, 6 mm (0-236 in.), at the extreme\nfront, 15 mm (5.91 in.) at the step, and 3 mm (0.118 in.) . at.\nthe rear end. The bottom is made perfectly tight by. interposing\ndoped and varnished fabric between the different layers of woOd.\n\n\t\n\n6\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35\n\nFifteen long itudinal glued and riveted ash strips transmit the\nstresses and shocks of alighting and taxying to the framework.\nThe up rights of the bulkheads also serve as the uprights\nof the four main girders of the hull. These continuous girders\nare of mixed construction, the lower members being made of wood,\nand the upper of high-resistance steel. At the rear end the\nfour main girders terminate in a steel post, which is extended\nupward and serves for attaching the fin and rudder. In the bow,\nthese girders form a solid support for the central engine.\nThe upper part of the hull is covered with birch plywood\n4 mm (0.157 in.) thick, and is protected by sheet aluminum at\nthe passage of the propeller of the central engine. The mooring\ndevices are solidly attached to the front part of the deck.\nThe sides of the hull are covered with birch plywood 3 mm\n(0.118 in.) thick, the lower portion being fur\n\nher protected by\n\na 3 mm covering of teak, and are joined to the\n\ndeck and to the\n\nbottom by chines and to the upright members of\n\nthe bulkheads\n\nby a very close checkerwork of ash strips. In\n\nthe rear and up-\n\nper portions the dheckerwork is alone retained\n\nand fabric is\n\nused instead of plywood.\nFloats.- With a total displacement of 2 m 3 (70 . 63 cu.ft.)\nand a structure similar to the bow of the hull, they are suspended from the wing at the end of a completely enclosed framework.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35\n\n\t\n\n7\n\nEmoennages.- The horizontal empennage is constructed like\nthe 7ing and consistsof two parts: a semi-fixed part of 3a\n\nm2\n\n(355.21 sq.ft.) and a movable part of 11 m 2 (118.40 sq.ft.).\nThe fabric-covered, all-metal vertical empennage is hinged\nto the rudder post on the one hand, and to the hull by an adjusting device on the other hand.\t\n(43.06\t sq.ft.);\n\nThe area of the fin is 4\n\nm2\n\nthat of the rudder, 7 m2\t (75.35\t sq.ft.).\n\nControls.- These coni p rise the steering Darts and the stabilizing tarts. The former are movable, balanced, and have dual\ncontrols, one by hand and one by servo-motor. A lever within.\nreach of the pilot insures instantaneous and sure transition\nfrom one method of control to the other without displacement of\nthe parts, even during a maneuver. The stabilizing parts, namely, the horizontal stabilizer, the fin, and the central ailerons are semi-fixed and can be operated in flight by means of\nsimple and irreversible controls.\nPower Plant.- This has a total power of 2100 I., and consists of five air-cooled Jupiter radial engines. The central\nengine installed in the bow of the hull and the lateral engines\nborne by the wings actuate two-bladed tractor propellers of 3 m\n(9.84 ft.) diameter. The plane of revolution of the propellers\non the lateral engines is 0.6 m (23.6 in.)in front of the leading edge if the wing.\nAll the parts behind the engines (pumps, filters, carburet-\n\nN.A.C.2.. .ircraft Circular\n\nrTO. 35\n\n\t\n\n8\n\nors, maretos) can be inspected during flight. For this purpose\na duralumin walkway sup p orted by the main ribs affords easy access through the inside of the wing, the free height being 1.6\nm (5 ft. 3 in.).\nTwo groups of four tanks of \'525 liters (139 gallons), located in the wing, contain the fuel required for seven hours\'\nflight at full p ower. Each tank is provided with a device for\nquick emptying, which insures its evacuation within less thai\n30 seconds. They are provided with level indicators comprising\na transmitter olaced on the tank itself, 8 "re p eaters" (one for\neach tank) located in the mechanics\' cockpit, and 2 "totalizers[\'\n(one for the port side and one for the starboard side), placed\nwithin view of the pilot. The piping, which connects them, is\ndone in such manner that each engine can be supplied equally\nwell from either one of the groups.\nThe engines are started with carbureted air furnished by a\nsmall auxiliary compressor. A distributer of air and ignition\ncurrent located in the mechanics\' cockpit, enables the starting\nof all five engines, one after another, in an extremely short\ntime.\nA set of fire extinguishers, automatic and controllable,\ncompletes the general equipment of the engines.\nControl Cockpits.- On account of the number and diversity\nof the instruments, two cockpits have been provided, one for the\np ilots and one for the mechanics.\n\ni\'TA..C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35\n\n\t\n\n9\n\nThe former, located in the leading edge of the wing, assures\nperfect visibility for the pilots. It has dual control and the\nseats are easily accessible during flight. In addition to the\nusual instruments, a set of five levers enables the pilot to\nmodify at will the revolution speed of one or more or all of the\nengines. A "safety box" affords him the possibility of testing\nthe efficacy of the fire extinguishers during flight. The instruments controlling the speed of the engines are visible to\nboth the pilots and mechanics at the same time. The mechanics\'\ncockpit is located in the wing at the level of the central engine. Here are grouped side by side the instruments for controlling the engines, the electric switchboards, including the switch\nfor charging the storage batteries, the starting rheostats of the\nservo-motor, the instruments for starting the engines, as likewise all navigation instruments equiring constant watching during flight. The location of the cockpit enables the mechanics\nto pass quickly to any part of the seaplane requiring immediate\nattention.\nz\nEauj-pMen t, On the sides behind the wing, two doors afford\naccess to the hull, which has two stories. The entrance is to\nthe uoper story from which a stairway leads down to a central\ncabin 10.5 m (34.45 ft.) long, 3.5\n\nrn\n\n(11.48 ft.) wide, and 2 m\n\n(6.56 ft.) high, in which 20 passengers can be very comfortably\ninstalled.\nA compartment in the bow contains the anchors, grappling\nirons, ropes, etc.\n\n10\n\nN.A.O.A. Aircraft Circular No. 35 \t\n\nIn the rear there is a radio cabin equioped with apparatus\nDowerful enouh to telegraph about 1500 km (932 miles) and to\ntelephone about 800 km (497 miles).\nStill farther to the rear are the toilet rooms, the commander\'s cabin and the baggage rooms.\nThe different compartments are lighted - 18 windows provided with sliding panes for ventilation.\nThe balance of the seaplane does not permit the use of the\nextreme rear of the hull, which is nevertheless spacious and is\nprovided with a walkway affording access during flight to the\nsteering controls.\nThe upper story is reserved entirely to the crew, which has\naccess by means of walkways and metal ladders, to all the delicate parts of the mechanism.\nCharacteristics\nSpan\n\n39.75 m\n\nLength\n\n(1301 ft.)\n\n27\n\nHeight\n\n(88.58\t\n(21.32\t\n\n"\n\n6.5\t\n\nPower,\t (5 Ju-olter engines)\t\n\n2100\n\n)\n"\t )\n\n.\n\nFull load\n\n17500 kg\n\n(48581 lb.)\n\nWeight empty\n\n12260\t\n\n"\n\n(37029\t\n\n)\n\nUseful load\n\n5240\t\n\n"\n\n(11552\t\n\n"\t )\n\nCrew and 7 hours\' fuel\t\n\n3440\n\n(17584\t\n\n"\t )\n\nFreight\n\n1800\n\n(13968\t\n\n"\t )\n\nWing area\n\n270 m2\n\n(2906.25 sq.ft.)\n\n\t\n\n11\n\nN.AC.A.

During these trial flights the following facts were noted.\nThe take-off was :ia.cLe wltflout airIlcuity, even irom a rougri\nsea, iith waves 1.5 rn (4.92 ft.) high, and without any help from\nthe p ilot. The trim was found to be p erfect at the very first\nflight. The maneuverability was entirely satisfactory. The\nsea1ane res p onded to the engines and obeyed the hand without\nexcessive effort on the part of the pilot. The maneuvers could\nbe made with the same precision by means of the servo-motor as\nby hand and r ithou-15 inmairing the reflexes of the Dilot.\nThis machine we.s thrown in and out of gear during flight without\n\nN.A.0.A. Aircraft Circular NO. 35\n\n\t\n\n14\n\nany difficulty. Its behavior on the water is perfects even when\nquite rough and in a cross wind.. Lastly, taxying and towing\nwere both effected in the best shape.\nin short, it may be affirmed, after these excellent results,\nthat the fears, entertained br many regarding the piloting of\nlarge seanlanes, have entirely vanished and that, as was to be\nexected, the behavior on the water is greatly improved by its\nlarge dimensions.\nAs to the performances, it is too early to announce the resuits. The tests will be continued and will be modified as the\nfinishing touches are made. At present the timed ground speed\nis 160 iQn (about 100 miles) per hour.\t\n\nDuring the tests,\t an al-\n\ntitude of 1200 m (3937\t ft.) was reached. in 30 minutes under full\nload. Fig. 10 shows the laboratory polars and also a modified\npolar which takes account of the action of the propeller slin\nstream. The abovementioned performances, as also the corresponding angles of attack show a remarkable agreement with the corrected. polar.\n\nThey thus justify the calculation methods used\n\nto determine them.\n\nThey will be the subject of a future commu-\n\nnication by us.\nAs indicated by the diagram, the propeller efficiency in\nthese experiments did not exceed 55%. This low value may be\nattributed to\nI. The nea\xc2\xb1ness of the plane of revolution of the pro p ellers to the leading edge of the wing, 0.6 m (23.6 in.). Since\n\nT.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular 1.0. 35 \t\n\n15\n\nthe velocity of the air stream underRbes important variations in\nthis plane, the ada p tation of a Dropeller to a given velocity\nseemed imossib1e, the calculations, as well as the flight measurements by means of a fl badin u (an air-speed indicator) having\nshown that these Variations attain as high as 50% of the velocity at infinity,\n2.\n\nThe small diameter of the propellers, \' 3 m (9.84 ft.),\n\nrenders the above effect more sensitive to the velocity variations superposed on the engine puffs, wh-ile it increases the\nrelative importance of the presence of the unhoused engine.\n3.\n\nLastly, the high engine speed of 1720 R.P.M. made it\n\nimpossible to obtain any great efficiency in the air stream retarded by the various abovementioned. influences.\nExperiments are being undertaken for the purpose of remedying these defects. The plane of revolution of the propellers\nwill be carried to 2 m (6.56 ft.) in front of the leading edge.\nand the diameter of the propeller may be increased to a maximum\nof 4.2 m (13.78 ft.), which will enable the use of reduction\ngears. The results to be expected from these changes are not\ndoubtful,since the polar indicatos very clearly in. what degree\nthe perfonances are improved by increasing the propeller off iciency. The combined increase of power and decrease of\nassures gains, particularly in speed, which, at first thought,\nmight an-p ear surprising.\nTranslation by Dwight I.I .
