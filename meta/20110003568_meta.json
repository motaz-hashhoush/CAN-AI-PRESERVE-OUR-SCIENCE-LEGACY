This method of managing capacity and controller workload could be made more flexible by dynamically modifying sector boundaries. Much work has been done on methods for dynamically creating new sector boundaries [1-5]. Many assessments of dynamic configuration methods assume the current day baseline configuration remains fixed [6-7]. A challenging question is how to select a dynamic configuration baseline to assess potential benefits of proposed dynamic configuration concepts. Bloem used operational sector reconfigurations as a baseline [8]. The main difficulty is that operational reconfiguration data is noisy. Reconfigurations often occur frequently to accommodate staff training or breaks, or to complete a more complicated reconfiguration through a rapid sequence of simpler reconfigurations. Gupta quantified a few aspects of airspace boundary changes from this data [9]. Most of these metrics are unique to sector combining operations and not applicable to more flexible dynamic configuration concepts. To better understand what sort of reconfigurations are acceptable or beneficial, more configuration change metrics should be developed and their distribution in current practice should be computed. This paper proposes a method to select a simple sequence of configurations among operational configurations to serve as a dynamic configuration baseline for future dynamic configuration concept assessments. New configuration change metrics are applied to the operational data to establish current day thresholds for these metrics. These thresholds are then corroborated, refined, or dismissed based on airspace practitioner feedback. The dynamic configuration baseline selection method uses a k-means clustering algorithm to select the sequence of configurations and trigger times from a given day of operational sector combination data. The clustering algorithm selects a simplified schedule containing k configurations based on stability score of the sector combinations among the raw operational configurations. In addition, the number of the selected configurations is determined based on balance between accuracy and assessment complexity.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110003568, "endDate": "2010-10-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "799cb822d3994c56b4f04102e768879b", "id": "211757b7e5d744b9be7f247e837110ea"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "799cb822d3994c56b4f04102e768879b", "id": "5330e7a1d09d4560b59955d10e82297f"}], "name": "29th IEEE/AIAA Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) 2010", "location": "Salt Lake City, UT", "id": "799cb822d3994c56b4f04102e768879b", "startDate": "2010-10-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110003568, "id": "6a916d708e3a40558bf7a73513e9d753", "publicationDate": "2010-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110003568.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110003568/downloads/20110003568.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110003568/downloads/20110003568.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110003568/downloads/20110003568.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
