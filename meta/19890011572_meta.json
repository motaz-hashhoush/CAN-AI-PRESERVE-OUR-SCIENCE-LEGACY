Two of the most valuable features of CFD are: (1) quick acquisition of flow field data; and (2) complete description of flow fields, allowing detailed investigation of interactions. Current analysis methods complement wind tunnel testing in several ways. Herein, the discussion is focused on CFD methods. However, aircraft design studies need data from both CFD and wind tunnel testing. Each approach complements the other.", "title": "Transonic propulsion system integration analysis at McDonnell Aircraft Company", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890011572, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cosner, Raymond R."}, "organization": {"name": "McDonnell Aircraft Co.", "location": "Saint Louis, MO, United States"}}, "id": "0fee6ade02a24025914e67c1d356e055"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890011572, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890011572, "id": "44dad8dcf03d49b2addc623c9e9d459d", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, Transonic Symposium: Theory, Application, and Experiment, Volume 1, Part 2", "publicationDate": "1989-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890011572.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890011572/downloads/19890011572.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890011572/downloads/19890011572.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890011572/downloads/19890011572.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
