The software treats each processing step in either a communications or navigation modulator or demodulator system as an independent, threaded block. Each threaded block is defined with a programmable number of input or output buffers; these buffers are implemented using POSIX pipes. In addition, each threaded block is assigned a unique thread upon block installation. A modulator or demodulator system is built by assembly of the threaded blocks into a flow graph, which assembles the processing blocks to accomplish the desired signal processing. This software architecture allows the software to scale effortlessly between single CPU/single-core computers or multi-CPU/multi-core computers without recompilation. NASA spaceflight and ground communications systems currently rely exclusively on ASICs or FPGAs. This software allows low- and medium-bandwidth (100 bps to approx.50 Mbps) software defined radios to be designed and implemented solely in C/C++ software, while lowering development costs and facilitating reuse and extensibility.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130013821, "id": "d5255d5bba97429ca84ab0c72bcb4dd5", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2013", "publicationDate": "2013-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130013804, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, June 2013", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130013821.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130013821/downloads/20130013821.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130013821/downloads/20130013821.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130013821/downloads/20130013821.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
