This session will present an overview of nanotechnology and let you learn about the advances in the field and how it could impact you. Some of the areas touched upon will be nanomaterials with their multifunctional capabilities, nanotechnology impact on energy systems, nanobiotechnology including nanomedicine, and nanotechnology relevant to space systems with a focus on ECLSS. Also, some important advances related to thermal systems will be presented as well as future predictions on nanotechnology.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100030504, "endDate": "2010-08-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c5941026853d41cab940c10c22b09def", "id": "5cb56ac1dab84db5812924f8b9d86933"}], "name": "Thermal and Fluids Analysis Workshop (TFAWS 2010)", "location": "League City, TX", "id": "c5941026853d41cab940c10c22b09def", "startDate": "2010-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100030504, "id": "74b7d3f75b6f4bec9a2696b76a663f80", "publicationDate": "2010-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
