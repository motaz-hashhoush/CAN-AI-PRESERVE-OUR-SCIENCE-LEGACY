In 1958, the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration initiated an experimental program\nto develop the technology for an artificial communications satellite and make that technology available t o the\ndesigners of operational systems.\n\nof his society: the accelerated acquisition of scientific\nknowledge, and the application of that knowledgethrough technological advances-to\n\nthe forces of nature.\n\nThe breakthrough which first catapulted communications beyond its line-of-sight and range-of-sound\nlimitations was Samuel Morse's development of the\ntechnique of transmitting signals by electrical impulse\n\nSeven years later, the first phase of NASA's vigorous\nprogram was completed, and the fruit of its effort could\nbe seen in the plans of a consortium of 20 nations,\ntogether with the U.S. Communications Satellite Corp.,\nto establish an international operational system.\nThis i s a report of what happened during those 7\nyears, of the historical elements which shaped them,\nand of the futurewhich they in turn have helped t o mold.\n\nHis electromagnetic\n\nelectricity.\nVoice transmission broke out of that same confinement a few decades later with Alexander Graham Bell's\ninvention of the telephone i n 1876.\nWith the telephone and the telegraph, man's ability\nto communicate rapidly over distance was limited only\nBut already\n\nmen of the new technology were experimenting with a\nforce which would permit communications t o leap even\n\nCivilization has always been dependent on comtransmission of information and ideas\n\nbetween individuals and between groups.\n\nalong a length of conducting wire.\n\ntelegraph became the first commercial application of\n\nby his capacity for stringing wire and cable.\n\nHistorical\nBackground\nrnunication-the\n\nwhich would transform his world and alter the structure\n\nBut until a\n\ncentury ago, men concerned themselves primarily with\n\nthis barrier: electromagnetic wave radiation.\n\nIt was\n\nreasoned that i f this radiation could be controlled and\nregulated, it could provide fast communications not\nrequiring wire or cables.\n\nthe content of communication: they explored the impli-\n\nGuglielmo Marconi discovered a practical way t o\n\ncations of the ideas that stirred them; they developed\n\naccomplish this, and in 1896 the first wireless radio\n\nthe tools-the\n\ncommunication was completed.\n\nwords and the images and the sounds,\n\nand the physical tools, too, the stylus and then the\n\nHard on the heels of their development, these\n\nraised the act of communicating\n\ndevices were put t o the task of bridging the oceans and\n\nto among the most exalted, necessary and meaningful\n\nlinking the continents.

Radio signals have been reflected\nfrom the moon and received on earth, using it as a passive\ncommunications satellite.\n\nUnited States and i n many other countries ran schedules\ngiving its orbital information after it was launched.\nEcho 1's public notice and acclaim were exceeded\nonly by its scientific usefulness.\n\nIt proved conclusively\n\nthe feasibility of using manmade passive communications satellites.\n\nIts aluminum-coated surface reflected\n\nabout 98 percent of the radio waves transmitted t o it,\nup t o frequencies of 10,000 megacycles. Those signals\n\nreflected from it made possible long distance telephone\nconversation, and the transmission of photographs and\n\ni\n\nmusic.\n\nEcho I1\nUsing information gained from the Echo I project,\nNASA scientists developed Echo I I , a larger and more\ndurable passive satellite.\n\nOn January25. 1964, Echo I I\n\nwas placed i n orbit by a 76-foot, liquid-fueled ThorAgena rocket which developed 170,000 pounds of\nthrust.\nWhen fully inflated, Echo II is 135 feet i n diameter\nand weighs about 575 pounds. Its skin i s mylar plastic\nbonded on both sides t o aluminum alloy foil, and is some\n40 percent thicker than that of Echo I .\nNASA's scientists determined from their experience\nwith Echo I that a slight initial overpressurization of the\nballoon would improve its surface smoothness and\nsphericity and thus greatly enhance its performance as\na communications satellite.\n\nTo achieve this they\n\ndeveloped a controlled inflation system.\nA number of packets containing pyrazole were\nsealed closed with temperature sensitive wax and attached t o the inside of the balloon prior t o folding and\npacking i n the canister for launch. After launch and\ncanister opening, the sphere was initially inflated with\nonly residual air, which. as the television camera aboard\nthe orbiting launch vehicle showed, carried the balloon\nto full extension in 20 seconds, but did not pressurize\nit. As the sphere absorbed heat from the sun, the wax\n\nseals on the pyrazole packets melted and the chemical\nwas transformed into a gas which pressurized the balloon.\n\nThis pressurization gave the skin a permanent\n\nset or stress which overcame its tendency to resume its\nearlier folded, wrinkled shape.\n\nEcho I I has remained\n\nEcho 1 as photographed b y the Boston University felescopc\ni n a time exposure.

This i s balanced, however, by the\nfact that much simpler equipment i s required on the\nground stations which work in conjunction with it.\nThe era of active communications satellites began in\nDecember 1958, when an Atlas rocket launched a U S .\nArmy relay satellite called Score into orbit.\nScore carried a radio transmitter and prerecorded\nChristmas greetings from President Eisenhower; ground\ncommands triggered transmission of the message.\nScore was relatively short lived-approximately\n\n30\n\ndays-but during that time it dramatically demonstrated\nits ability t o relay voice, code, and teletype messages.\nCourier. developed by the Army Signal Corps, fol-\n\nTelstar was deveioped by the American Telephone & Telegraph, launched for A.

In operation, it received signals and\n\nstored them on tape while it was in view of one ground\nstation; then on command it retransmitted the signals\nwhen it was i n sight of another station.\nTechnical difficulties ended Courier's ability t o send\nmessages after 18 days i n orbit-but\n\nduring that time it\n\nreceived and retransmitted 118 million words.\n\nProject Telstar was developed by the American\nTelephone & Telegraph Co., in cooperation with NASA.\nThe first of the two satellites in this project-Telstar\nI-was\n\nlaunched by NASA on July 1 , 1962.\n0\n\nIt was\n\nplaced i n orbit by a three-stage Delta rocket.\nIt advanced considerably the active repeater con-\n\ncept, and its impact on the public's attention was\nsubstantial.\n\nUnited States and European television\n\nstations exchanged some 50 television programs-both\nblack and white and color; telephone calls were made\ni n both directions, and facsimile and telephotos were\nre1ayed.\nI n addition, t h e satellite performed more than 300\n\n* R e a l time transmission is the reporting of information\nsimultoneously with the acquisition of that information.\n\nvaluable technical tests, almost all of them with successful results.\n\nDuring the first Telstar experiments the satellite was\nt racked by ground stations i n Maine, England, and\n\n___\n\naboard another Delta rocket 10 months later (on May 7,\n\n.\n\n,.p-.\n\nIYOJ),\n\nI\n\n.I\n\n7\n\n,\n\n.\n\nwas mucn rne same as I eisrar\n\n*\n\nI,\n\nexcept for a few\n\nFvidpnce nf the cnrnrnunicatinn+ _ . _ _...__\n_ _ _ . _ . _ _ _ . . _ _ I _ _ _ +atpllitc.\xe2\x80\x99c\n\n-\n\nimprovements that made its weigh t 5 pounds heavier.\n\ncontribution to international cooperation was the estab-\n\nA redesign of some of the second Telstar\xe2\x80\x99s electronics\n\nlishment of other ground stations i n Italy, Brazil, Ger-\n\nprovided it with greater resistance to radiation change,\n\nF:ranre\n\n__\n\nmany, Japan, Sweden, and Spain by late 1964.\nFor 4 months Telstar I functioned as planned,\nhandling more than 400 transmissions.\n\nI n November\n\n1962 the satellite unexpectedly provided U.S. scientists\nwith another \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d-ground\n\n. . . . . .. .\n\n. .\n\nand i t s elliptical orbit has an apogee (the farthest distance from the earth reached i n the orbit) almost twice\nas high as that of Telstar I.\nThis higher altitude keeps the satellite out of the\n\ndiagnosis of a malfunc-\n\nhigh-radiation regions of space for a greater part of the\n\nIt was determined\n\n225-minute orbiting time, and also provides it with\n\ntioning communications satellite.\n\nthat unexpectedly high levels of radiation had damaged\n\nlonger periods when it is visible from, and consequently\n\nsome of the transistors i n the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s command\n\ncan communicate with, both United States and European\n\nC ircuit.\n\nground stations.\n\nOn February 21, 1963, after failing to respond t o\nC ommands\n\nfrom the ground, Telstar I went silent.\n\nTelstar 11, which followed i t s predecessor into orbit\n\nThe satellite was mysteriously silent fro m July 17\nt o August 12, 1963, but with that exception it has\nfunctioned well.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNASA-DOUGLAS DELTA FLIGHT SEQUENCE FOR TELSTAR Il-Figure I shows separation of first stage.
