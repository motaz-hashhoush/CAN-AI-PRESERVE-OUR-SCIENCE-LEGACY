POWER\nCONTROL VALVE\n\nNERVA STATUS SUMMARY\n\nIn July of 1963, most of the problems associatedviith the development of NERVA have been\nidentified and a solution has been demonstrated for many of them, and a solution is now evident for\nthe remainder.\n\nHowever, one significant obstacle pacing the development at present is concerned\n\nwith the mechanical design of the reactor.\n\nPending solution of the reactor mechanical design, only\n\nlimited procurement and development of non-nuclear engine components and subsystems is being\npermitted and such development is restricted to so-called "critical items, " that is, those critical\nto engine or reactor operation or te st.\n\nThus, for example, development of the propellant feed\n\nsystem is proceeding, but only cursory effort is being devoted to the thrust structures or thrust\nvector control system.\nSome of the critical engine items are further illustrated in the following few charts followed\nby the support equipment items and facilities.\n\nNERVA REACTOR\n\nAn isometric drawing of the NER VA experimental reactor is shown in the accompanying chart.\nThis configuration is based on the KIWI-B4 LASL concept and technology and there is an extensive\nbackground of data and information available regarding this reactor going back to the first reactor\nin the KIWI test series, the KIWI-A tested in July of 1959.\n\nThe reactor is made up of a core fabri-\n\ncated from a number of hexagonal, uranium-loaded, graphite fuel elements containing the hydrogen\nflow passages.\n\nThe cylindrical beryllium reflector surrounds the core and a lithium hydride shield\n\nis mounted on the forward end to provide a significant reduction in radiation reaching the propellant\ntank and engine components mounted forward of the shield.\nThe neutronics are well understood, the physical properties of the materials are well known,\nthe fuel element fabrication process has been developed, the controlled start-up has been demonstrated, and methods have been found for protecting the fuel elements in the hydrogen environment.\nHowever, as evidenced in the most recent KIWI-B tests, there is a difficult structural problem\nrequiring solution - a mechanical design to provide structural integrity in a unique internal aerodynamic and thermodynamic environment.\n\nAs a result of the continuing reactor problem, the\n\nindustrial contractor has been invited to participate more fully in the solution of the mechanical\nde sign problem and for this effort the initial NER VA ground rule requiring utilization of KIWI\ntechnology and configurations has been modified.\n\nBack up reactor structural designs are being\n\nevaluated, and one or two of the more promising will undergo further analysis and design prior to\nDecember of this year, when a decision will be made regarding fabrication and test of the back-up\nreactor . .\n\nNERVA PROPELLANT FEED SYSTEM\n\nThe propellant feed system basically consists of the tank shutoff valve, reactor cooldown\nvalve, turbopump, turbine power control valve, and associated check valves and lines.\nThe tank shutoff valve is a two position valve (normally closed), and actuated by a gas piston\nwith a spring return.\n\nThe vtlve is mounted directly on the tank outlet through the use of a remote\n\nactuated disconnect coupling.\nThe cooldown valve is two-position (normally closed), and actuated by a direct current electric\nmotor.\n\nThis valve allows propellant from the tank to bypass the closed tank shutoff valve.\n\nThe turbopump assembly, shown on the opposite page, consists of a mixed-flow centrifugal\ntype pump directly coupled to a multistage gas turbine.\n\nThe drive shaft is supported byantifriction\n\nbearings which are contained within the bearing housing.\n\nBoth roller and ball type bearings are\n\nused and liquid hydrogen is used for lubrication and cooling.\nThe turbine power control valve is used to regulate turbopump speed.\nis used which is pneumatically actuated through a servo-mechanism.\nby the engine programmer.\n\nA butterfly type valve\n\nValve position is controlled\n\nNERVA THRUST CHAMBER ASSEMBLY\n\nThe NERVA thrust chamber assembly consists of the nozzle, reactor pressure vessel, upper\nand lower thrust structure, and gimbal.\nThe nozzle shown on the opposite page is of conventional stainless steel tubular construction.\nBecause of the large contraction ratio of the nozzle, the longitudinal loads (which are carried by the\ntubes in chemical rocket engines) are very high, and a supporting cast aluminum shell must be provided around the tube bundle.\n\nCare must be exercised to insure good thermal contact of the shell\n\nwith the tubes to prevent overheating from thermal radiation induced by the reactor.\n\nSpecial\n\ncooling circuits are provided for all material not in direct contact with the main propellant flow,\nand through all thick sections, such as the flange at the junction between the nozzle and the reactor\npressure vessel.\nThe pressure vessel consists of two units, a cylinder and a forward enclosure.\nis joined to the forward closure and the nozzle with high strength bolts.\n\nThe cylinder\n\nPorts are located in the\n\nclosure for control rods, turbine diluent line, and instrumentation.\nThe thrust structure is made in two parts, an upper structure and a lower structure.\n\nThe\n\nupper structure is a conical stiffened shell, attached to the vehicle tank through a quick disconnect,\nand attaches to the upper gimbal yoke by bolts.\njoined to a cylinder.\n\nThe lower structure is a conical stiffened shell,\n\nThe lower thrust structure is attached to the aft gimbal by bolts and to the\n\npressure vessel by means of a quick disconnect.\nThe gimbal assembly is located between the upper and lower thrust structures.\n\nThe pump\n\nsuction line cools the gimbal without creating a significant temperature rise in the fluid.\n\nThe\n\ngimbal assembly has the capability of being actuated over a four degree angle in any direction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DESCRIPTION\nSTAINLESS STEEL TUBE BUNDLE\nCAST ALUMINUM JACKET\n\xe2\x80\xa2

VESSEL\nALUMINUM\nTITANIUM\n\nNERVA ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM\nThe five primary control functions required in the NERVA engine are the flux-level control,\nthe core-exit-gas-temperature control, the chamber pressure control, the cooldown control, and\nthe attitude control.\nThe reactor flux-level control loop consists of neutron sensors, amplifiers, reactivity-control\ndrums, and control-drum actuators.\n\nThe control-drum actuators are servo subsystems and, as\n\nsuch, constitute an inner loop of the flux loop, since control-drum position is fed back to the actuator servo valve to control the drum position.\nThe temperature-control loop consists of thermal probes, amplifiers, and compensation,\nwhich provide s a continuous command signal to the reactor flux loop.\n\nThe chamber pressure control loop consists of pneumatic actuators, turbine throttle, pressure\ntransducers, electronic compensators, and signal amplifiers.\n\nThe turbine power control valve\n\nactuator and amplifier which has undergone extensive testing including irradiation is shown on the\nopposite page.\nThe cooldown-control loop consists of a cooldown control valve, amplifier, switching circuits,\nand thermal probes.\n\nThe turbopump system is bypassed by the cooldown valve and the cooldown\n\ncontrol operates off tank pressure.\nThe engine programmer is comprised of reference generators, sequencers, amplifiers, logic\ncircuits, malfunction circuits, timers, and registers.\n\nThe programmer provides the sequencing\n\nlogic nece s sary for the steady- state and transient conditions of the engine system.\nThe attitude control is made up of amplifiers, servo actuators, a gimballed engine, and roll\nnozzles, which, when combined with the vehicle guidance system, will perform the desired control\nfunction.\n\nNUCLEAR ROCKET TEST FACILITIES AND\nREMOTE HANDLING EQUIPMENT\nNUCLEAR ROCKET DEVELOPMENT STATION\n\nA general facility location plan at the Nuclear Rocket Development Station, Jackass Flats,\nNevada, is shown on the opposite page.\n\nThis shows the Kiwi test area and facilities in use for\n\nsorre time; the NERVA test area and facilities, now under construction; and the RIFT area, whose\nfacilities are to be designed and built in the future.\n\nPRESENT\n\n~~adQt\n\nAHe-mbl)\'/r>l~\xc2\xab$i~emb!y\n\nENGINE TEST STAND ETS-l\n\nOne of the most complex of the installations is the Engine Test Stand (ETS), an artists\'\nconcept of which is shown on the facing page.\n\nThe stand superstructure rises approximately\n\n140 feet above the track deck, and the vault containing the ,exhaust duct is 55 feet deep.\n\nAlso\n\nshown is the transport/installation system, various propellant and pressurant tanks and various\nother items of facility support equipment and structure.\n\nETS-l CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS\n\nGround was broken for this facility in June 1961, one month before the NERVA contract was\nawarded.\n\nWhile the civil works are largely completed, as shown in the photograph, approximately\n\ntwo additional years will be required to provide the facility instrumentation, the engine test control\ndevices and to complete activation and check-out.\n\nNERVA EXHAUST SYSTEM\n\nOne concept for the exhaust duct is shown on the opposite page.\nhave been designed and S01:ne scale-model testing performed.\n\nExhaust duct configurations\n\nDesign work is expected to be com-\n\npleted before the end of the year, with about one year required for fabrication and installation.\n\nThe\n\nduct is required to dispose of the high temperature hydrogen exhaust gas which has been subjected\nto the radiation environment of the reactor.\n\nBecause of the temperature of the exhaust gasses, the\n\nduct must be cooled, and the flow and heat transfer characteristics present a challenging design\nproblem.\n\nENGINE MAINTEN ANCE ASSEMBLY/DISASSEMBLY (E-MAD) BUILDING\n\nAnother significant facility is the Maintenance Assembly/Disassembly Building shown on the\nopposite page.\n\nThe non-nuclear engine assembly will be delivered to NRDS from Aerojet\'s Sacra-\n\nmento plants and the reactor system will be delivered from the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe engine will be assembled in the E-MAD building and moved to and in-\n\nstalled in the test stand by the transport/installation system.\n\nShown in the building cutaway are the\n\nwall-mounted manipulators, the overhead positioning system, and various floor-mounted handling\nfixtures.\n\nMajor disassembly of the engine following a test will occur in the large "hot" area.\n\nEn-\n\ngine subassemblies and components are disassembled in a series of satellite cells located around\nthe main disassembly area.\n\nNERVA TRANSPORT INSTALLATION SYSTEM\n\nAn artist\'s concept of the system used to transport the engine to and from the test stand is\nshown on the accompanying figure. . It consists of the engine installation vehicle, the shielded\nmanned control car and the prime mover.\n\nThe assembled engine is mounted on the installation\n\nvehicle in the E-MAD building, transported to the test stand and remotely installed into the test\nstand under the control of the personnel in the control car.\n\nFollowing a test, the engine is re-\n\nmotely disconnected from the stand, returned to the E-MAD building for disassembly and post\nmortem inspection.\n\nNON-NUCLEAR TEST FACILITIES\nAT THE AEROJET SACRAMENTO PLANT\n\nThe following figures are photographs of the special facilities that have been built to support\nthe non-nuclear engine development test program at Sacramento.\n\nThe first is a photograph of\n\nthe ITlodifications that have been made to one of the Titan test stands to accoITlITlodate NERVA\n\nturbopump development and engine simulator test program.\n\nThe recently built liquid hydrogen\n\nrun tank for non-nuclear engine system development in another Sacramento test area is shown\nin the second figure.\n\nThe new engineering cryogenic laboratory is shown in the last figure.\n\nIt\n\nwill be used for the development of various cryogenic feed system components and tests of the\nhydrogen cooled bearings.\n\nNERVA DESTRUCT SYSTEM FACILITY\n\nA site plan of the destruct system test area at Hawthorne, Nevada is shown in the accompanying figure.\n\nA number of destruct system tests have already been conducted in this area and addi-\n\ntional facility installations will permit more thorough evaluation of the various destruct system\nconcepts.\n\nHAWTHORNE, NEVADA TEST FACILITY\n\n,/,\n~"""\'."--:~,\n\n,.; tI> :~ \' ....q\n\n~\n\n"\n\n"\n\n. .\\\n\n~~ ...."~ - . .\n~;, "~r ~i"~ "\n~,-~,\'i_";"\n.....,~\n,-*t\nP- II\n.... . ::!::,:~ ..J.... \'f"\' ... . ~.,,,"~~1If ~\n-\n\n.....\n\n1-\n\n:>"\n\nc.\'\n\n\'-"\n\n-.\n\n-\'..l.~..\n~ ,..

Also indicated are the\ndesign operating points for the Mod a/Mod 1, Mod 2 and Mod 3 engines.\nsignificant in this figure, however, is the limitations on engine operation.\ncial since they determine the possible bounds of engine operation.\n\nimposed by the cool-down tank driving pressure.\n\nWhat is particdlarly\nThese limits are cru-\n\nThe first limitation is that\n\nThe region of pump instability was plotted based\n\non the minimum specific speed as defined by pump development te sts.\n\nTwo limits on core exit gas\n\ntemperature, one based on the maximum steady- state core temperature limit of 4300 0 F and the\nother on the transient core temperature limit of 4500 0 R.\n\nThe component which limits the axial\n\nload carrying capability of the overall thrust structure is the gimbal assembly.\nis designed to operate at a maximum thrust load of approximately 84, 000 lb.\n\nThis component\nThe upper and\n\nlower thrust structures, however, have the capability to withstand thrust loads up to approximately 450, 000 lb.\n\nThe last limitation on engine operation is the fluid temperature into the core\n\nas set by the requirement that no liquid hydrogen enter the core, since this could create local\nuncontrollable excess reactivity.\n\n4500\n\n\\\n\nI" 7 j\n;:;:::=:::::=~~--,\n\n2\n\nI"S\n\n_L__\n\nS=IL_:~_---:~-T\n\n_... /\n\nI "\'-1700\'\n\n7\n\n,--\n\n--V 2000\n\n/\n\nCORE STEAOY$TATE TEMpERATURE L1MIT/ . -\n\n~\'" I/\n\n~\n\nMOD,2\n\n9E~IGN\n\n\'6.

Present calculations indicate that to maintain flow\n\nstability in the core flow passages, a minimum flow rate of approximately 2.5 lb/sec is required.\n\nFor the accepted tank pressure of 25 psia, a flow rate of 3. 3 lb/ sec is available for\n\nafterheat cooling. This is sufficient to handle a power level of 25 mw with a core exit gas temo\nperature of 2000 R. This is considered to be the limiting temperature due to conductive and\nradiant heat transfer which could result in subjecting some structural components to excess\ntemperature.\n\nHowever, since this flow rate would cool the reactor too fast, a pulse cooling\n\ntechnique is tentatively planned.\nSince the time at full power operation affects the heat generation rates, .the engine cooldown schedule will vary for the various engine modes.\n\nIn the following figure, a typical cool-\n\ndown schedule for the Mod 1 engine after 1200 sec operation at rated conditions is shown.\nAlso listed on the figure are the number of pulse s required and the propellant consumption\nduring a 72 hour vehicle coast period.\n\n70~-1~----+-----+--\n\n2500\n0.::\n\no\n\n0.::\n\nILl\nIt\'D\n\n::E\n\n;!IOOO\n(.)\n\n601\n\nj,L\n\nStart Cooldown Phase\n.\n.\n\nI\n\nChamber Temp.\n\nChamber Press.\n\nd\n\n"\'BanFf_ErI\'lnE RBU.rtIOJliEDOMlA\n\nENGINE DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE\n\nA development schedule, representing the best estimate of future events, is presented in the\naccompanying chart.\n\nBecause of the reactor mechanical design problem, there is no engine de-\n\nvelopment schedule included in the official NER VA program planning documents, the emphasis\nthrough 1965 being placed on react?r development.\n\nHowever, based on successful reactor dern-\n\nonstration, the first engine test could be \'conducted early in 1966, followed by initiation of PFR T\nin 1968, first flight in 1970, and a first operational flight in 1972.\n\nThe various operational NERVA\n\nengine modes will each require analysis to determine the effects of the various development complications on the overall engine development program.\n\n----LII nllr-lnr...crLLL..__~""_-""""":\xc2\xa3""LI\'l.AlI_lIIIIIIIIlIIIIIIIl_o.IIr\nJ "\n\n\xc2\xa3.
