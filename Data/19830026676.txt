Franciscus\nNationalAeronautics\nand Space Administration\nLewisResearchCenter\nCleveland,\nOhio\n\n#BSTRACT\n\nNASA contract. The results of their studies\nshowed that this type of engine may be a more\nefficient powerplant for supersonic cruise\naircraft than any of the other types being\nconsidered.6 Additional in-house studies at\nLewis showedsimilarattractive\nresults.\n7\n\nEngine performance\nand mission studieswere\nperformedfor turbofanengines with supersonic\nthrough-flow\nfans. A Mach 2.4 CTOL aircraftwas\nused in the study. Two missions were considered: a long range penetrator\nmission and a\nlong range interceptmission. The supersonic\nfan engine is comparedwith an augmentedmixed\nflow turbofanin terms of mission radius for a\nfixed takeoff gross weight of 75,000 lbm. The\nmissionradiusof aircraftpoweredby supersonic\nfan engines could be 15 percent longer than\naircraft powered with conventional turbofan\nengines at moderate thrust to gross weight\nratios. The climb and acceleration\nperformance\nof the supersonicfan engines is better than\nthat of the conventional\nturbofan\nengines,\n\nFor the long supersoniccruise range consideredin the SCR studies,a large part of the\nadvantage of this engine is attributed to\nimprovedengine SFC\'s at supersoniccruise and\nto a lesser extent to the increaseddry thrust\nto engineweight.\nA preliminary\nstudy of the use of supersonic\nthrough-flow\nfan engines for CTOL militaryaircraft was initiated to indicate if military\naircraftwould benefit by this engine concept.\nThe initial resultsof this study are presented\nin this paper.\n\nNOMENCLATURE\nBPR\nCET\nF\nFPR\nft\ng\nhr\nlbm\nlbf\nM\nn mi.\nOPR\nsfc\nTAUG\nTOGW\nU\nW\n\nThe study encompassed\naircraftwith missions\nrequiring extended supersonic cruise ranges.\nTwo engine types were includedin the study: a\nsupersonic\nthrough-flow\nfan engineand a conventionalmixed flow augmented\nturbofan.

The supersonicfan is a supersonic through-flowfan stage, i.e., supersonic\nabsolute\nMach numbersat the fan face and stator\nexit. The supersonic\nfan would lead to improvements in the overall propulsionsystem. These\nimprovements are a reduction in fan weight\n(single-stage\nvs. multi-stage),reductions in\ninlet losses (at supersonicflight),and inlet\nweight, and more flexibilityin matching the\nenginecycle to the airplanethrustrequirements.\n\nSubscripts\nAB\nENG\nMAX\n0\n\nabsolute\nengine\nmaximum\nambient\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe intentof the Supersonic\nCruiseAircraft\nResearchProgram(SCR) sponsoredby NASA (19721981) was to identify and investigateareas\nrequiringnew and improvedtechnologythat would\nlead to substantial improvements in performance.\n1\nThe program was focused mainly on\ncommercial\nsupersonic\ncruiseaircraft. A number\nof advancedengine conceptswere identifiedby\nthe industryas being attractivefor a commercial SST.\n2-5 The supersonicthrough-flowfan\nengine was proposed by Advanced Technology\nLaboratories,Inc. and studied by them under\n\nThe inlet lossesand weightare lower than a\nconventional inlet because little diffusion\n(velocity\ndecrease)of the air is required. As\nshown in figure 2, the fan face absoluteMach\nnumbers range from 1 at takeoff to values\nslightlyless than free streamduringsupersonic\nflight. At Mach 2.4 cruise, for example,the\nfan face Mach number is about 2 and the diffusion of the air is about 400 ft/sec. In a conventional inlet, the diffusion is about 1,500\nft/sec. Therefore, less boundary layer bleed\n(and associated bleed drag) is required to\n\nThis paper is declared a work of the U.S.\n\nGovernment and therefore is in thepublic domain.\n\n1\n\n_-\n\naccomplishthe lower diffusion for the supersonic fan. The lower diffusion also reduces\nspillagedrag. These drag reductionsresultin\nimprovementsin the overall inlet performance\nshown in figure3.\nSince the supersonicfan exit Mach numbers\nare always supersonic(fig. 2) the duct nozzle\ncould be mechanically simpler (no throat\nrequired)than a conventional\nC-D nozzle. This\ncould lead to a more efficientand lighter nozzle than a conventional nozzle. However,\nbecause the fan discharge Mach numbers are\nsupersonic, a diffuser is rec_ired for the\nenginecore air (fig. i). Only the core of this\nengineis equippedwith an augmentor. The conventionalengine used for comparisonis a two\nspool mixed flow augmented turbofan (fig. 1).\nThe same technology\nwas assumedfor the cores of\nboth engines,\n\ndevice. The pressurerise across the inlet at\nMach 2.4 would be about 2 comparedto i0 for the\nconventional inlet. Preliminary performance\nestimatesof the supersonic\nfan inlet were taken\nfrom reference 7. The core diffuser is different from a conventionalinlet. Except for\nstarting,inlet Mach numbers are always supersonic rangingfrom 2 at takeoffto 3 at Mach 2.4\ncruise (fig. 2). Because no data exists for\nthis type of diffuser,a typical Mach 3 inlet\npressure recovery of 0.85 was assumed. This\ncomponent\nwould be a required\narea of research.\nPropulsionsystem weight estimatesfor the\nconventional\nturbofanand the core of the supersonic fan engines were calculated using the\nmethods from reference 9. For the supersonic\nfan and its inlet, nozzle, and core diffuser,\nthe weights were scaled from the data of\nreference\n7.\n\nMETHODOF ANALYSIS\n\nRESULTSAND DISCUSSION\n\nThe study reflecteddifferencesin engine\nthrustand SFC, pod drag, and propulsion\nsystem\nweight. Mission performancecalculationswere\nmade to determinemission radius as a function\nof sea level static thrust/gross\nweight for a\nfixedtakeoffgrossweightand payload,\n\nEngineperformance\nand weight - As mentioned\npreviously,\nthe operatingcharacteristicsf the\no\nsupersonicfan lead to improvedpropulsion\nsystem performance. In additionto the low inlet\nlosses (fig. 3) the cycle can be matched better\nto the aircraft thrust requirements. In the\nconventional bypass engine the bypass ratio\nincreaseswith flightMach numberfrom 1 at sea\nlevel static to 1.3 at Mach 2.4. This leads to\nlower dry thrustand an increasein afterburning\nto obtain the requiredthrust, resultingin SFC\npenalties. For the supersonicfan engine the\nbypass ratio decreases from 1 at sea level\nstatic to 0.7 at Mach 2.4. However,since the\nbypass air of the supersonic fan engine is\nsupersonic, burning in the duct flow would\nentail heavy losses. Therefore,only the core\nnozzlehas an afterburner. For the same thrust\nrequirement,\nthe supersonic\nfan engine would be\na larger engine size than the conventional\nturbofan.\n\nTwo missions were selected to study the\nengines for a variety of flight conditionsand\nrequirements. The mission profilesare illustrated in figure 4. Mission A is a predominately supersonicmission similar to a penetrator type mission and mission B would be\nsimilar to a supersonicinterceptwith a subsonic loitercapability. The total range is the\nsum of the climb/acceleration,\ncruise,and letdown ranges. Fuel reservesinclude an enroute\ncontingency 5 percentof the missionfuel and\nof\nprovision\nfor a 20 minuteloiter,\nThe airplaneused is the study is an arrow\nwing vehiclewith poddedengines. The airplane\ngross weight (75000 LBM), payload (6000 LBM),\nand operating empty weight less propulsion\nweight remainedfixed so that the mission radius\nvaried with changes in engine performanceand\nweight,\n\nFigure 5 shows a comparison the SFC\'s of\nof\nthe two engines at Mach 2.4. Both engines are\nsized for a sea level thrust to airplanegross\nweight ratio of 0.9 (F = 33750 ibf). The sea\nlevel static airflow of the supersonic fan\nengine is 370 lb/seccomparedto 260 lb/secfor\nthe conventionalturbofan (about 40 percent\nlarger). However, the maximum dry thrust at\nMach 2.4 is nearly twice that of the conventional engine. As indicatedin figure 5, the\nSFC\'s of the supersonicfan engine are lower\nthan those of the conventional\nengine. At the\ncruise operatingpoint shown in the figure,the\nSFC of the supersonicfan engine is i0 percent\nlowerthan that of the conventional urbofan.\nt\n\nThe installed engine performance for the\nengineswas computedwith the engine cycle computer program of reference 8 which performs\ncycle calculations,\ndesign, and off-designon a\ncomponentby component basis. Except for the\nsupersonicfan, the componentaerodynamic\ncharacteristics,\nefficiencies,\nand cooling requirements for conventional\nfans, compressors,\nturbines,combustors,\netc. used in the programwere\nthe same for both engines. For the supersonic\nfan a baseline design adiabaticefficiencyof\n0.85 was assumed and the aerodynamics were\nobtainedfrom reference6. Installation\nlosses\nincluded inlet and nozzle drags and nacelle\nfriction\ndrag.\n\nFigure 6 shows the engine performancefor\nthe Mach 0.8 loiterof MissionB (fig. 4). Both\nengineswould operateat low throttle. For the\noperatingpoints shown in the figure, the conventionalturbofan would have somewhat better\nperformancethan the supersonicfan because it\nis throttled\nback less.\n\nThe airflow scheduleand performanceof a\nMach 2.4 translatingcenterbodyinlet was used\nfor the conventional\nturbofanengine. The inlet\ndrag penaltiesshown in figure 3 include spillage, bypass, and bleed. The inlet for the\nsupersonic fan would be a low compression\n\nFigure 7 shows the climb/accelerationerp\nformanceof the two engines sized for the same\nsea level static thrust loading. As mentioned\nbefore the supersonic fan diameter would be\n2\n\nlarger than that of the conventional\nturbofan\nfor the same sea level static thrustbecauseit\nhas a lower thrust per unit airflow. As shown\nin figure 7, the acceleration/climbhrust of\nt\nthe supersonicfan engine is greater than that\nof the conventional\nturbofanand the SFC\'S are\nsignificantly\nbetter. As seen in figure 8, the\nsupersonic\nfan enginewould be about 30 percent\nlighter than the conventional\nturbofanfor the\nsame sea level staticairflow. For the same sea\nlevel static thrust, the propulsion system\nweightsare about the same.\n\nresults indicatethat the supersonic\nfan engine\ncan meet these requirements with a better\nmission radius than is achievable with a\nconventional ugmented\na\nturbofan.\nThese preliminary results are attractive\nenough to suggest conductinga more in-depth\nanalysis of this engine. Such an analysis\nshould include an extensive study of the fan\naerodynamics\nand a detailedmechanicalstudy of\nthe engine.\n\nMission studies - For Mission A the major\npart of the fuel is used during supersonic\nflight. Even though the climb/acceleration\nthrust of the supersonicfan engine is greater\nthan that of the conventional\nturbofan(for the\nsame thrust to weight airplane takeoff gross\nweight ratio)and the SFC\'s are lower (fig. 7).\nThe savings in fuel over this portion of the\nmission are small. The propulsion system\nweights are also about equal. The supersonic\nfan engineachievesthe high missionradii shown\nin figure 9 due to lower SFC\'s at Mach 2.4\ncruise (fig. 5). The major improvements\nare at\nthrust to weight ratios of 0.4 to 0.6 corresponding to take-off distanceof 2500 to 1700\nfeet. At higher valuesof thrust to weight the\npropulsion system weight for both engines\nbecomes large. Also, the wing loading (TOGW/S)\ndue to increasing wing size, decreases with\nincreasingthrust to airplaneweight ratios to\nachieve the 3g manuever and wing weight\nincreases. The fuel available for supersonic\ncruise becomes small for both engines at high\nthrust to weight ratios. The mission radiusis\nabout equal for both engines at a thrust to\nweight ratio of 1. However,a five minutetime\nto climb requirementcould be achievedby the\nsupersonicfan engine at a much higher mission\nradius than is achievableby the conventional\nturbofan\nengine (F_ = 0.65 vs. 0.95 (fig. 9)).\nFor Mission B, the decrease in mission\nradius with increasingthrust to gross weight\nratios is much the same as for Mission A\n(increasing\nengine and wing weights). However,\nabove thrustto weights ratios of 0.7 the conventionalturbofanengine achieveshigher radii\nthan the supersonic\nfan engine. This is due to\nthe 60 minute loiter at Mach 0.8. The conventionalturbofanhas betterSFC\'s at loiter (fig.\n6). At the higherthrustto weight ratioswhere\nthe total available fuel is decreasing, the\nsaving in fuel at loiter becomesmore critical.\nHawever,the supersonic\nfan engine achievesthe\nfive minute time to climb requirementat a\nhigherradiusthan the conventional\nturbofanfor\nMissionB also.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
