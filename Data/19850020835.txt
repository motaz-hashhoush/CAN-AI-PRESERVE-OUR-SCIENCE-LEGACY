Tresansky; John R.\nManning; Sol Sheinbein\n1571\nABSTRACT\nA high voltage power supply is formed by three discrete circuits (12, 14, 16) energized by. a battery (18) to\nprovide a plurality of concurrent output signals floating\nat a high output voltage on the order of several tens of\nkilovolts. Each circuit has a regulator stage (20,28,36).\nIn the first two circuits, the regulator stages are pulse\nwidth modulated and include adjustable resistances (Rl,\nR2) for varying the duty cycles of pulse trains provided\nto corresponding oscillator stages while the third regulator stage includes an adjustable resistance (R3) for\nvarying the amplitude of a steady signal provided to a\nthird oscillator stage. In the first circuit, the oscillator\n(22), formed by a constant current drive network and a\ntuned resonant network including a step-up transformer\n(46), is coupled to a second step-up transformer (24)\nwhich, in turn, supplies an amplified sinusoidal signal to\na parallel pair of complementary poled rectifying, voltage multiplier stages (76, 7 6 ) to generate the high output voltage. Each of the other two circuits include\noscillator drive stages (30, 38) which, together with\nisolation transformers (32, 40) provide output signals\nfloating at the high output voltage.\n\n18 Claims, 12 Drawing Figures\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMay 14,1985\n\n4,517,472\n\nSheet 1 of 5\n\nd\n\nrr,\n\na\n\n\\\n\n5\n(v\n\nm\n\nm\nm\n\nY\n-\n\n0\nP\ndm\nk\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMay 14,1985\n\nSheet 2 of 5\n\n4,5 17,472\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nMay 14,1985\n\nSheet 3 of 5\n\n4,517,472\n\nFIG 3A.\nFIG. 3B\nFIG\n\n3c\n\n"\n\nlLcLcL\nA\n\nFIG 30\n\n0\n\nInA-\n\nFIG 3 4 7\n\nTy1\n\n\'0\n\nFIG 3F\nFIG 3G\n\n1\np\np\n\nI\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n4,5 17,472\n\nSheet 4 of 5\n\nMay 14,1985\n\n-----\n\n1\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n$1\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n. .\n\n0\n\n--I\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\n, I\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nr-----\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3\n1\n\nI\n\nI\nf\nC\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n6\na\n\nUS.Patent\n\nMay 14,1985\n\nSheet 5 of 5\n\n4,s 17,472\n\n1\n\n4,5 17,472\n\nHIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY\nORIGIN OF T H E INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made by employees of the United States Government and may be manufactured and used by or for governmental purposes\nwithout the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.\nTECHNICAL F I E L D\n\nlo\n\nThis invention relates to electrical power supplies\nand, more Particularly, to a Power sutpb\' for providing\na plurality of high voltage output signals.\nBACKGROUND A R T\n\nl5\n\n2\n\nAlso, the saturable core of the transformer is a significant source of energy loss, a factor which renders these\nconfigurations unsuitable for use in battery powered,\nhigh potential supply sources. The presence of such\nripple renders this type of Power Supply unsuitable for\nuse in applications where both a constant high voltage\nand a well regulated but much lower amplitude voltage\nfloating at the high voltage are required as output signals because the ripple from the high voltage stage\ndestroys the regulation of the low voltage stage.\nAttempts to improve the regulation of output potentials have included efforts to compensate for variations\nin output voltages due to causes such as changes in\nloading. Such efforts typically rely upon a pulse width\nmodulator to regulate a chopping transistor driving the\ncenter tap of the primary winding. In these configurations a feedback loop, such as a current sensing stage is\noften used to provide an analog signal for controlling\nthe duty cycle of the modulator in proportion to\nchanges in the loading of the transformer\'s secondary\nwinding. This type of power\nis\nsuitable for\nproviding high voltages, however, because of a lack of\nelectrical insulation between the input and output sides\npower\nrequire\nOf the circuit\' Moreover,\nsynchronization between the pulse width moduiator\nand the transformer, a feature which restricts the range\nover which the duty cycle of the modulator may be\nvaried to\nfor changes in loading Of the\nPower Supply.\nOther Power supplies have attempted to obtain well\nregulated output signals by using a separate control\ncircuit having ancillary oscillator and base drive stages\nto regulate switching of transistors driving a transformer in a power converting stage. The ancillary circuits themselves require a power supply. The presence\nof such ancillary circuits and their individual power\nsupply undesirably adds to the complexity and physical\nbulk of the overall design. Moreover, the control circuit\nin such power supplies is driven by a feedback signal\nobtained directly from the output terminals of the\npower supply, a feature which prevents insulation of the\ncontrol circuit from the output voltages and, therefore,\nrenders these power supplies unsuitable for generation\nof high output voltages.\nRecent efforts to enable a power supply to provide\nhigh voltages suitable for operation of x-ray tubes have\nincluded a variety of capacitive discharge circuits. One\npower supply, for example, included a motor driven,\nrotating commutator providing sequential discharge of\nindividual capacitors through the primary winding of a\nstep-up transformer\'\ncapacitive discharge\nare adequate for providing high\ntype power\nvoltage impulses of short duration, without extensive,\npower consuming filtering, the transient phenomenon\naccompanying discharge renders such power supplies\nunsuitable for providing well regulated output voltages.\nAdditionally, the presence of motor driven, rotating\ncommunators makes such Power supplies less than ideal\nfor use in small, Portable devices.\n\nHigh\npower supplies have typically been low\nfrequency networks characterized principally by their\nmass, bulk and relative inefficiency. Recent advances in\nsuch\nas diagnostic x-ray devices (e.g., the\n2o\nIntensity X-ray and Gamma-ray Imaging Device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,1427101) have established a\ndemand for portable, battery driven power supplies able\nto deliver a plurality of regulated, static output voltages\non the order of tens of kilowatts for periods of several 25\nhours. The operational characteristics of such devices\nusually require that each potential furnished by a power\nsupply be separately adjustable.\nCurrently available battery operated power supplies\ntypically have a push-pull inverter stage coupled across 30\na center tapped primary winding of a saturable core\nstep-up transformer. When the core saturates, a potential is induced in a second winding which causes the\ninverter stage to reverse its mode of conduction. The\nfrequency of operation of the inverter stage is princi- 35\npally controlled by the saturation time of the transformer. Often in such configurations, a feed-back potential is derived from a secondary winding and applied to\ncontrol the amplitude of the voltage applied by the\ninverter Stage to the transformer. A Voltage multiplier 40\nstage driven by another secondary winding is used in\nsuch configurations to provide an increased output\nvoltage while a voltage divider stage Converts the outPut from the multiplier stage into a Plurality of different\noutput signals.\n45\nThe use of voltage induced in the secondary winding,\nas practiced by these prior art power\nfor\nswitching the conduction mode of the inverter stage\ncauses the output current provided by the transformer\'s\nsecondary winding to be generated as a series of square 50\nwaves pulsing at the same frequency at which the inverter is being switched. In effect, such power supplies\nrely upon the transformer to establish the switching\nfrequency of the inverter stage; harmonics of the\nswitching frequency are, therefore, included in any 5 5\nsignal appearing across the secondary windings of the\ntransformer. The presence of such harmonics intraduces substantial undesired ripple into the output signals provided by the power supply.\nMoreover, the use of a divider stage to provide multi- 60\nple output signals prevents independent adjustment of\nthe output potentials. Furthermore, the presence of\nSTATEMENT OF INVENTION\nhigh current spikes occurring during changes in core\nAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention\nsaturation and the sudden change in the amplitude of\ncurrent which occurs at each transition between pulses 65 to provide an improved high voltage power supply.\nIt is another object to provide a power supply able to\ncauses a reflected ripple current which, in turn, causes\nelectromagnetic noise that detrimentally interferes with\ncontinuously furnish a well regulated output potential\nthe operation of any neighboring electrical equipment.\non the order of tens of kilovolts.\n\n.\n\n3\n\n4.517,472\n\nIt is a further object to provide a battery powered\npower supply able to continuously furnish a well regulated output potential on the order of tens of kilovolts.\nIt is yet another object to provide a power supply\nproviding a plurality of independently adjustable, high\nvoltage output potentials.\nIt is also an object to provide a power supply providing a plurality of well regulated, high voltage outputs.\nIt is a still further object to provide a portable, battery\npowered power supply able to continuously furnish a\nwell regulated output potential on the order of tens of\nkilovolts.\nThese and other objects are achieved with a high\nvoltage power supply having a plurality of circuits\ncoupled in parallel between an unidirectional energy\nsource and a common output terminal, and providing a\nplurality of concurrent output signals. T w o of the circuits include modulated regulator stages driving corresponding oscillator stages with pulse trains having particular repetition rates. A third one of the circuits has a\nregulator stage controlling the flow of energy between\nthe energy source and a third oscillator stage. Each of\nthe oscillator stages includes a transformer forming part\nof a tuned network and providing a sinusoidal signal at\nthe frequency of the tuned network across secondary\nwindings coupled on one side to the common output\nterminal. One of the first two circuits also includes a\nstep-up transformer supplying an amplified corresponding one of the sinusoidal signals to a parallel pair of\ncomplementary poled rectifying, voltage multiplier\nstages which, in turn, provide a unidirectional output\nvoltage having an amplitude on the order of several tens\nof kilovolts between the common output terminal and a\nnetwork reference. The sinusoidal signal provided by\nthe second of the two circuits floats at the amplitude of\nthe unidirectional output voltage while the third circuit\nincludes a rectifier stage converting the corresponding\nsinusoidal signal into a unidirectional signal having an\namplitude varying slightly from that of the unidirectional output voltage.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nA more complete appreciation of this invention and\nmany of the attendant advantages thereof will be\nreadily apparent as the same becomes better understood\nby reference to the following detailed description in\nwhich like numbers indicate the same or similar components, and wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of\nthe present invention arranged to provide power to a\ntypical load.\nFIG. 2 is an electrical schematic diagram of a high\nvoltage circuit included in the embodiment of FIG. 1.\nFIGS. 3A through 3B illustrate waveforms of signals\noccurring at several points throughout the high voltage\ncircuit shown in FIG. 2.\nFIG. 4 is an electrical schematic diagram of a second\ncircuit included in the embodiment of FIG. 1.\nFIG. 5 is an electrical schematic diagram of a third\ncircuit included in the embodiment of FIG. 1.\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F T H E\nINVENTION\nRefer now to the drawings and, in particular, to FIG.\n1 which illustrates the interconnections between the 65\nvarious stages of a power supply for providing several\nindependently adjustable output potentials to such devices as a triode type x-ray tube 10. The power supply\n\n4\n\nis formed by three multi-stage circuits 12, 14, 16 coupled in parallel between a direct current source such as\na battery 18, and a common output terminal P1.\nCircuit 12 includes a switching regulator stage 20\nhaving its input coupled across battery 18 for driving a\nsine wave oscillator 22. An adjustable resistance, such\nas a rheostat, R1 is included in regulator stage 20 to\nadjust its duty cycle. The output of oscillator 22 is applied across a primary winding of a step-up isolation\ntransformer 24. A secondary winding of transformer 24\nis coupled across a voltage multiplier 26 which furnishes a negative potential difference on the order of\nseveral tens of kilovolts between output terminals Pl,\nP2. Output terminal P1 is common to all three circuits\nwhile terminal P2 is connected to a reference potential\nsuch as a network ground.\nCircuit 14 has a switching regulator stage 28 coupled\nacross battery 18 and a rheostat R2 providing adjustment of its duty cycle. Regulator stage 28 provides a\npower to a push-pull drive stage 30 which, in turn, has\nits output applied across a primary winding of an isolation transformer 32 which, in turn, develops an alternating voltage on its secondary winding. One side of the\nsecondary winding of transformer 32 is coupled to common output terminal P1 while the other side thereof\nforms output terminal P3.\nCircuit 16 includes a linear regulator stage 36 coupled\nacross battery 18 for providing power to oscillator\ndrive stage 38. Regulator stage 36 operates as a linear\nresistance which consumes power from oscillator 38 to\ncontrol the amplitude of generated signals in response\nto variations in output voltage sensed by the regulator.\nAs adjustable resistance R3 is provided for the regulator. The output of drive stage 38 is applied across a\nprimary winding of an isolation transformer 40. A secondary winding of transformer 40 has one leg coupled\nto common output terminal P1 and its other leg coupled\nto terminal P4. This winding develops an output signal\nwhich is rectified by a diode D1 and filtered by a capacitance C1 to provide a low amplitude direct voltage\nbetween terminals P1 and P4.\nTransformers 24,32 and 40 are compact, high voltage\nisolation transformers which are disclosed in a copending application entitled \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Voltage Isolation Transformer\xe2\x80\x9d filed on June 21. 1983, and assigned Ser. No.\n506,477; also identified as NASA Case No. GSC\n1 2 317- 1.\nIn the power supply of FIG. 1, circuit 12 is designed\nto provide a well regulated voltage having an amplitude\non the order of several tens of kilovolts (e.g., - 80 kV)\nbetween terminals P1, P2 while the other circuits 14, 16\nare designed to provide output signals at voltages differing from the voltage occurring between terminals PI.\nP2 by less than one kilovolt. In the exemplary application shown, terminals P1, P2 are connected to establish\na potential difference between a filament 34 and an\nanode 44 of x-ray tube 10. Output terminals P1 and P3\nare coupled across filament 34 while terminal P4 is\ncoupled to a grid 42 of x-ray tube 10. The commonality\nof output terminal P1 to all three circuits assures that\noutput signals provided by circuits 14, 16 float at a high\nvoltage near the level of the constant potential difference between terminals P1, P2. Consequently. the signal\napplied to filament 34 by circuit 14 has a direct current\npotential of several tens of kilovolts (e.g., - 80 kV) with\nrespect to terminal P2. The power supply also applies a\ndirect voltage to grid 42 which has an amplitude varying between the sum and difference of the high voltage\n\n,\n\n5\n\n4,5 17,472\n\nappearing between terminals P1, P2 and the potential\nsupplied by circuit 16 between terminals P1, P4. The\npotential difference between terminals P3, P4 is designed to be slightly more negative (e.g., 80 to 150 volts)\nthan the potential applied across filament 34 to enable 5\ngrid 42 to repel and thereby focus electrons emitted by\nfilament 34 in to a stream directed toward anode 44,\nthus causing anode 4 to emit an x-ray beam 45. Anode\n4\n44 is coupled to the network reference potential.\nFIG., 2 illustrates in detail the several stages of high 10\nvoltage circuit 12. Regulator stage 20 is formed with a\npulse width modulating regulator M1, such as a commercially available sixteen pin SG 1524 integrated circuit chip manufactured by Silicon General Company.\nResistance R4 and capacitance C2 are coupled between 15\nports 6 and 7 of regulator M1 and a reference potential,\nto establish the internal pulse repetition frequency, fi, of\nregulator stage 20. Adjustable resistance R1, in conjunction with fixed resistances R5, R6, form a voltage\ndivider establishing an adjustable reference voltage 20\n(across resistances R5 and R1) and a fixed reference\nvoltage (across resistance R6) to ports 2 and 16, respectively, of regulator M1 for establishing the duty cycle of\nregulator M1. Power is supplied directly to regulator\nstage 20 via input terminal P5 to port 15 of regulator M1 25\nand to the remainder of circuit 12 via the emitter and\ncollector electrodes of a transistor Q1. The base of\ntransistor Q1 is biased by resistances R7, R8 and connected, via resistance R7, to output ports 12,13 of regulator M1. This enables regulator M1 to establish the bias 30\nvoltage applied to the base of transistor Q1 and thereby\ncontrol whether transistor Q1 is in a conducting or a\nnon-conducting mode so that while regulator M1 is in\none state of its duty cycle, transistor Q1 is held in a\nconducting mode, thereby allowing current to flow 35\nfrom terminal P5 to the center taps P6, P8 of primary\nwindings W7, W8, respectively, of a step-up transformer 46 via the emitter and collector electrodes.\nWhile regulator M1 is in the other state of its duty\ncycle, the bias voltage applied by regulator M1 to the 40\nbase of transistor Q1 holds the transistor in a non-conducting mode, thereby interrupting the flow of current\nbetween terminal P5 and transformer 46. Each output\nport of modulator M1 provides regulation for fifty percent of a cycle. Coupling the base electrode of transistor 45\nQ1 to both output ports enables regulator M1 to adjust\nthe modulation of the transistor between about five and\nninety-five percent of each cycle. Transistor Q1 is, in\neffect, a chopper which provides a continuous train of\ndirect current pulses to an inductance L 1 and center tap 50\nP6 of winding W7 of transformer 46. The width and the\nfrequency of the pulses are controlled by the duty cycle\nand frequency, fl, respectively, of regulator M1. The\nwaveform of the train of voltage pulses appearing at\nnode P7 is shown in FIG. 3A. With a battery 18 provid- 55\ning a direct voltage of about fifteen volts to terminal P5,\nand regulator M1 set to operate with a duty cycle of\nabout fifty percent, the average voltage appearing at\nnode P7 will be approximately seven and one-half volts.\nA constant current sinewave oscillator 22 is formed 60\nby transformer 46, a pair of transistors 4 2 , 4 3 coupled\nin a push-pull configuration between the two center\ntapped windings W7, W8 of transformer 46, and inductance L1. Inductance L 1 is coupled between the collector electrode of transistor Q1 and center tap P6 of pri- 65\nmary winding W7. The energy stored in inductance L 1\nmaintains a continuous current flow through winding\nW7 while transistor Q1 is held in a non-conducting\n\n6\n\nmode. The waveform shown in FIG. 3B represents the\namplitude of current flowing through inductance L1.\nThe base electrodes of transistors 4 2 , 4 3 are coupled\nacross winding W8. Bias voltages are applied to the\nbase electrodes by the two sections of winding W8\nthrough a potential applied to center tap P8 from current flowing from node P7, through a series of resistances R10, R11 and a diode D3 which restricts the\ncurrent flow through center tap P8 to a single direction.\nDuring each cycle of the oscillator, one of transistors\n4 2 , 4 3 is held in a non-conducting mode by the amplitude of the potential applied to its base electrode while\nthe other transistor is held in a conducting mode with\ncurrent flowing through inductance L 1 and across its\ncollector and emitter electrodes via center tap P6 and a\ncorresponding section of winding W7, and through the\ncollector and emitter junction of either transistor Q2 or\n4 3 . Resistance R12 establishes a potential between the\ncoupled emitter electrodes of transistors Q2,Q3 and the\nnetwork reference potential for current sensing while a\ndiode D 4 assures a constant current flow through inductance L 1 when transistor Q1 is in a conducting\nmode.\nA capacitance C3 is coupled across primary winding\nW7 while a capacitance C4 is coupled across a secondary winding W9. Together, capacitances C3, C4 and\ntransformer 46 form an equivalent tuned resonant circuit which establishes a resonant frequency, f2, for oscillator stage 22. As represented by FIGS. 3C and 3D, the\namplitudes of voltages appearing across the collector\nelectrodes of transistors Q2,Q3, respectively, each have\nhalf cycle sinusoidal waveforms with a frequency equal\nto f2. The turns ratio between windings W7 and W9 is\nselected to provide a step-up in the voltage across winding W9. A turns ratio of about 1:14.5,for example, will\nprovide a peak-to-peak voltage across winding W9 of\napproximately one hundred and ten volts.\nSwitching between the conducting and non-conducting modes of transistors 4 2 , 43 occurs at twice the\nresonant frequency f2 (Le., once every one-half cycle)\nestablished by capacitors C3, C4 and transformer 46,\nand is implemented by the bias voltages applied by\nwinding W8 to the base electrodes of each of the transistors. Voltages induced across winding W8 exhibit the\nsame sinusoidal waveform (albeit with smaller amplitudes) as voltages occurring across the collector electrodes. Windings W7 and W8 are wound in a flux additive direction. Consequently, as the voltage on one\ncollector electrode of transistors 4 2 , 4 3 falls to zero\ndue to cycling of the equivalent resonant circuit, a reversal of current occurs through winding W8, thereby\ncausing simultaneous shifts in the bias voltages induced\nacross winding W8 applied to the base electrodes.\nThese shifts cause the transistor which has a mininum\ncollector voltage to be biased in a conducting mode\nduring a one-half cycle while the other transistor is\nbiased in a non-conducting mode. Assuming, for purposes of explanation, that voltage on the collector of\ntransistor 4 3 reaches a minimum at time to, as is shown\nin FIG. 3D, then the simultaneous shift in the bias voltages places transistor 43 into its conduction mode and,\nfor one-half of a cycle, allows current to flow through\ninductance L1, one part of winding W7, across the\ncollector and emitter electrodes of transistor 4 3 , and\nthrough resistance R12 to the network reference potential. The amplitude of current flowing through the collector electrode of transistor 4 3 is represented by the\nwaveform shown in FIG. 3E.\n\n7\n\n4,5 17,472\n\n8\n\nCapacitance C5 is coupled between resistances R10,\nsponse to changes in the voltage developed between\nR11 and the network reference potential to provide\nterminals P10, P11 and is used, therefore. to provide a\nfiltering of transient currents caused by the transition of\nfeedback signal for governing the duty cycle of regulatransistor Q1 between its conducting and non-conducttor M1 set by resistance R1. The feedback signal is\n5 taken from terminal P13 and applied via a current limiting modes.\nTransformer 24 exhibits a high degree of leakage\ning resistance R14 directly to port 1 of regulator M1\ncurrent due to a large number of closely spaced turns in\nand, via filters formed by a resistance R15 coupled in\nits primary and secondary windings. A capacitance C6\nparallel with a capacitance C8, and by a capacitance C9\nis serially connected between the network reference\nserially coupled to a resistance R16, to ports 9 and 16 of\npotential and one end of primary winding W1 of trans- 10 regulator M1. A change in the voltage developed beformer 24 to provide series tuning with the leakage\ntween terminals P10, P11 is reflected by transformers\ninductance and thereby assure that at the oscillator\n24, 46 in the amplitude of the voltage occurring across\nfrequency, the series combination of the leakage inducwinding W10 which, in turn, causes a change in the\ntance and capacitance C6 form an equivalent zero net\namplitude of current in the feedback signal applied via\n15 resistance R14 to regulator M1. The feedback signal\nimpedance.\nFIG. 3F represents the sinusoidally alternating voltapplied directly to one port of regulator M1 effectively\ncreates an offset voltage to a constant five volt signal\nage applied by secondary winding W9 of transformer 46\nto primary winding W1 of transformer 24. A sinusoisupplied by port 16 of regulator M1; the offset voltage\ndally alternating voltage of higher amplitude, reprevaries linearly with changes in the feedback signal. The\nsented by the waveform shown in FIG. 3G, is devel- 20 potential difference between the reference signal and\noped by transformer action across secondary winding\nthe feedback signal applied to port 9 of regulator M1 is\nW2. Transformer 24 (to be discussed in greater detail\namplified internally by regulator M1, thereby enabling\nhereinafter) is designed to provide across winding W2 a\nregulator M1 to automatically respond to changes in the\nsubstantial voltage increase over the voltage applied\nvoltage across terminals P10, P11 as those changes are\nacross winding W1. A turns ratio of approximately 1:92, 25 reflected back to winding W10, by internally varying\nfor example, will produce a peak-to-peak voltage of\nthe length of its duty cycle, thus causing a correspondabout ten kilovolts between terminals P11, P10.\ning change in the average amplitude of the signal apSecondary winding W2 is connected across voltage\nplied to center tap P6 and, ultimately, in the voltage\ndeveloped across terminals P1, P2.\nmultiplier 26 which is formed by a complementary pair\nof oppositely poled, high order voltage multiplier stages 30\nThe feedback voltage occurring at terminal P13 is\n76, 76\'. Each of these stages has five cascaded units\nalso applied directly to the anode of a zener diode D8\nformed by pairs of capacitances C7 and diodes D5. One\nand, via resistances R20, R21, to bias the base electrode\nside of each one of multiplication stages 76, 76\' are\nof a transistor 4 4 . The cathode of diode D8 is coupled,\nvia the emitter electrode of transistor 44 and a resiscoupled together, in parallel, across terminals P10, P11\nof secondary winding W2. The diodes D 5 in each stage 35 tance R22, to the gate electrode of silicon controlled\n76, 7 6 are arranged with opposite polarities, thereby\nrectifier D2, and, via a resistance R23, to the network\ncausing the stages to exhibit opposite polarities, thus\nreference potential.
