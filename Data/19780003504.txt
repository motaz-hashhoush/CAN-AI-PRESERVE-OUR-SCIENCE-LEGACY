The generation number of the\nimagery was such that the degradation on the film made\nany densitometric measurements unreliable. For this\nreason densitometry was not pursued and it was decided\nto utilize the digital data on computer tape (CCT)\ndirectly.\nDigital Techniques\nDigital data for November 1972, June 1973, December\n1975 and January 1976 have been utilised in the study,\nto date. All the processing of the digital data lzas\nbeen done on a Cyber 173 computer with line printer output.\nThis form of output has severely hampered the work of\nselecting training sets and portraying information, and\ncreated problems in understanding the resultant classification maps. In commencing this digital classification it\nwas .found the.t the state of the art classifiers (S of A)\nin particular the quadratic discrimant function classifier\nand the parallelopiped classifier, do not provide the\nresolution in landcover classes that were required for this\nproject. This meant that it was necessary to develop a\nnew classifier being called the Vector Classifier (Vec).\nThe Vec classifier is a linear classifier in comparison\nwith the S of A classifiers which are point classifiers.\n\na\n^\n\nThe Vec classifier has been reported elsewhere.1\nThe classifier has been verified in a number of situations;\n(i.)\t\n\nThe mixed pixel situation of sand andscrub in the\ncoastal zone of South Australia. ,\nl\n\n(ii)\n\nWithin turbid lakes in\xe2\x80\xa2South Australia and western\nVictoria.1\n\n(iii) Within Bool Lagoon, l a large inland lagoon within\nthe South East of South Australia containing a\nvariety of water rushes and open water areas.\nIt is intended to verify the classifier for the\ngrasslands of the South East before the classifier can be\nused in a general mapping program. To verify the classifier\nin the grasslands of the South East it was determined to\nbe necessary -to establish extensive field information within\nthe area. To do this the visual imagery was used to select\ngeneral topographic and geologically homogeneous regions\nin the South East provinces and within these areas training\nareas were selected so that they would be distributed across\nthe provinces and also take into account the climatic\nvariations across the area. By arrangement with the. Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF), an officer of that\nDepartment collected field information along selected road\ntransects within the sample areas and at 36 day intervals\ndesigned to coincide with alternate LANDSAT overpasses.\nColour and False colour photography were flown over the\ntraining areas with Hasselblad cameras in December 1975,\nconsidered to be the median point for likely successful\nimagery. Our problem was that at =ham time of collecting\nthe field data, :ate the nhotos_=_nhy, w=_ were not to know\n.../3\n\n3 -\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY.\n\nWhether the Lnacs_y was success`-A! or not, and in fact\ndid not find ou - -.._s informat_:.n until about three months\nafter the overpass. As it turnau out the 30th December\n1975 and the 16th January ,1976 imagery were successful in\nthe South East and the 30th December LANDSAT imagery very\nclosely matched the field information and the aerial\nphotography. Having collected the field data and by\nutilising the flown photography, landcover maps were\nproduced of the training areas., with each landcover class\nbeing identified by a 17 digit integer. These landcover\nmaps have been digitised and will be matched to the imagery\nat the two relevant dates, so that detailed analysis can\nbe undertaken on the relationship between landcover condition\nand spectral response in that image. The fact that we\nwere not aware of the success or otherwise of the overpass\nfor so long until after the event meant that the collection\nof field data was necessarily inefficient. Only two people\ncould be employed on collecting field data for the nine\nmonth period, September 1975 to June 1976, with the result\nthat much of the collected data was of no value to the\nproject. A better alternative would be to have the same\nmanpower used in collecting the information, on only a\nfew, dates, for which it was known that the overpasses were\nsuccessful, providing more data than we were able to,\nfor a similar outlay,\n(III) ACCOMPLISMENTS\nThe overall objective is t-o relate measured soil\nmoisture and evapotranspiration at Konetta hydrological\nStation with repetitive ERTS imagery and so infer soil\nmoisture and evapotranspiration conditions in other parts of the Region and to at least partially check the\nresults in selected Sub-Catchments.\nWhilst the project has not been completed a number\nof significant accomplishments have been achieved in -the\nclassification of land cover and its condition, ,a prerequisite\nto the eventual fullf:i.1]ment of the overall objective.\n(i)\t\nd\t\n\nV\n\n{\t\n\nDevelopment of a fine resolution Vector Classifier\nVea.)\nThe fine resolution classifier is not suited\nto be a general classifier but will provide a very\nfine resolution within a general class. The\nclassifier assumes a linear change in response\nbetween the bands with changes in landcover type.\nThe. classification of each pixel is in terms of\nthe proportions of the limiting response values\nfor the particular landcover class, so that the\nvery finest resolution that is practicable can be\ni\ndetenitined. The develo ,ment of Lle classifies: i.s\ns=milar to the mixed pixel concept first enunciated:\nby Malila and Nalepka, and has been extended into\na classifier suitable for mixed_ pixel: situations as\nwell as situations of environmentally changing\nsurface types with demonstrated linear change in\n.,./4\n\n`)\t\n\nORIGINAL\' PAGE IS\n0"1 POOR QUALITY\n\n- 4 4\n\nresponse of one ban.: against the other bands across\nthat surface type. "_\'he derivation of the classifier\nand the evidence of the success of that classifier\nhave been published elsewhere. 1 r 3 Evaluation of the\nclassifier has been done in a number of situations.\n\nt\n\nP\t\n\na. The mixed pixel situation in the coastal zone\nof the South East of South Australia consisting\nof a mixture of the two surface types of sand\nand coastal scrub. In -this case the classifier\nhas been shown to give results that are very close\nto that that would be expected from the. derivation,\nyielding reliable estimates of -the areas of sand\nand scrub surface.\nb. The turbid Lakes of the South East and in\nWestern Victoria. These lakes have been shown\nto exhibit a linear correlation between the\nresponse values of the different bands with\nchanges in lake condition so that the lakes\ncould be satisfactorily classified to a very\nfine resolution with the Vec classifier.\n\nti\n\nc. Boo! Lagoon, a. large inland lagoon consisting\nof open water and areas of four different species\nof waterrushes was shown to have a linear correlation between the response values in. the differentbands, with changes in surface condition across\nthe lagoon. Boot Lagoon has been mapped from\nLANDSAT on three dates and the continued existence\nof the linear correlation between the bands response\nvalues has been proven, although the reasons for\nthat linearity are not known.\nWhilst the Vec classi:t\'ier can not be considered\nas a general classifier in the same way as current\nS of A classifiers can be, it provides a finer\nresolution than is capable of being achieved with\nthe current S of A classifiers. It could therefore\nbe considered as a second heirarchy classifier\nprovidi*ig finer resolution in those classes previously\nclassified by a S of A\'classifier, and within which\nthe user requires a finer resolution than that provided\nby the. S of A classifier. For example within the\ncases already mentioned or within the pasture lands\nwhere it may be required to get an estimate of the\ngreenness-dryness or the bulk of the pasture, and\nwhere. this cannot be readily obtained from S of A\nclassifiers it is antic:Lpated that it will be quite\namenable to the Vec classifier. The Vec classifier\ndetermination of the limiting response\ncnly\nvalues and veri.fi cation of the li nearitLL? condition,\nAll intermediate pixels are classified in teens of\nthese limiting response values, or nodes, as proportions\nof the nodes. With S of A classifiers however, training\nsets are required for each class and this is frequently\nimpracticable, particularly towards the limiting cases\nbecause very few if any pixels consist of only the\n\nrequires\n\nI\t\n\nli\n\ne\n\n.../s\n\n- 5 true limiting cases, so that the classification is\ndone using classes that would rarely be distributed\nin an optimum way along the linearity, and which\nwill often have insufficient pixels within tha\ntraining sets to provide reliable class statistics.\n(ii)\t\n\nDevelopment of the concept of Vernier Control?.\none of the essential things that is required\nin remote sensing is the establishment of a viable\nand practicable method of providing spatial and\nradiometric control for the imagery. A method of\ndetermining or establishing position in the imagery\nto better than 1/10 pixel position has been proposed\nas a result of the \'LANDSAT program in the South East\nof South Australia. With this concept, mirror control\npoints similar to that used by Evans of Stanford Research\nInstitute will be established at an interval slightly\ngreater than the pixel interval, so that along a line\nof pixels most of which are affected directly by\nresponse from a mirror, will occur a mirror not\ndirectly affected by a mirror. The position of this\nlower response pixel along the line of higher response\npixels is related to the position of the first mirror\nwith in its first pixel working in exactly the same way\nas does a vernier, in this way we can get very reliable\nestimates of position, and misidentification can be\neliminated as a significant source of error. It is\nour opinion that Landsat D imagery when provided with\nthis sort of control could be used for 1:100.000\ntopographic mapping \'or landcover updating, and\npossibly even 1:50 000 series mapping also. The\ncurrent imagery could be positioned to 1:100 000\nmapping accuracy standards but the pixel resolution\nis too coarse for mapping at that scale. Work done\nhere and in Canada using detail to match the 14ANDSAT\nimagery to ground control., has given standard errors\nin position of the adjusted pixels coordinates of theorder of 0.4 pixel units (30 m).\nMisidentification of control is a serious problem\neven when sharp boundary conditions exist as they\ndid in our work in the South East and for the Canadian\nwork along their northern coast. Misidentification\nremains a serious problem because the sampling\ncharacteristics of the scanner means that the resolution\nand characteristics of the LANDSAT imagery are quite\ndifferent to the, scene by an observer either on aerial\nphotograph, a map or on the ground. This must lead\ntoa measure of confusion as to the exact matching\nof a pixel to ground position. It is therefore essential\nthat reliable methods of control are established in\nthe imagery, for all situations.\nThe\'general accomplishment that-has been achieved\nin this project is -to prove that remote, sensing is\nnot only a tool, but is also an extension of man\'s\nsensing capability. It is only through his sensing\n.../6\n1\n\n.1:\t\n\n11\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2l i \xe2\x80\xa2:I.V\t\n\n,\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\t\n- 6 -\n\nI\nI\t\n\ncapabilit_es is mar, able to perceive his environment,\nfy\nand subse q uently modi- and improve that environment.\nTherefore remote sensing must reveal information\nabout the environment not previously available, and\nindeed often riot even known to exist. This must lead\nto a better awareness of the characteristics of our\nenvironment and subsequently to improvement in that\nenvironment-. We believe that remote sensing is\ntherefore not only an extension of mans sensing\ncapability, but is also a tool to be used .n environmental\nmanagement.\n(IV)\n\nSIGNIFICANT RESULTS\nWithin the wider application of LANDSAT imagery as\ndeveloped during this follow-on project.\nMapping of the Coastal Zone\nThe South Australian Coast Protection Board is\nsupporting a project to map the coastal zone using LANDSAT\nimagery, by the Vec classifier, with the purpose of\ninvestigating the application of -the technique to management\nof the coastal zone. It has been established that reliable\nestimates of sand and coastal scrub areas can be. determined\nfrom LANDSAT rage classification by the Vec classifier more\neconomically than by conventional means from a map of the\ncoastal zone produced by photointerpretation using 1:10 000\naerial photography. Current LANDSAT imagery is also suitable\nfor monitoring for large scale storm damage -to the Zone, but\nthe normal change in sand areas extent due -to man\'s activity\nor other reasons, is about 5 to 10 m per year, occasionally\nbeing as great as 30 m per year, so that it is considered\nthat LANDSAT D will have the resolution necessary -to monitor\nthese changes but not current imagery. The operational\nprogram will thus allow the Coast Protection Board to maintain\nsurveillance on t-he coastal zone, to decide what areas need\ninvestigative or restorative action based on the L\'\'-NIDSAT\nevidence, and to inventory the resources of the c::,a>tal zone.\n\n(V)\n\n333\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n1.\n\n"The Vector C1\'assifier", McCloy K.R., Proceedings,\nEleventh International symposium on Remote Sensing\nof Environment, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Apr. 1977.\n\n2.\n\n"Geometric Fitting of LANDSAT Imagery", McCloy K.R.,\nBulletin, Remote Sensing Association of Australia,\nVol. Number,\t\n, July 1977.\n\n3.\n\n"The Application of LANDSAT imagery in Coastal Zone\nManagement", McCloy K.R., Proceedings, Seminar on\nApplications of Remote Sensing to Coastal Nianagement"\nof the Coastal Zone, University of\'Sydney, Sept. 1977.\n\n4.\n\n"The Application of Remote Sensing to Land Evaluation11,\nMcCloy K.R., Proceedings, Seminar on Land Evaluation,\nUniversity of Adelaide, Sept. 1977.\n..,/7\n\nv\n\nj\n\nA}i\ni\n\ni\n\ns\n\n\t\n1\t\n\n1 M1:\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n..J y\n\n0P PO Olt\n-\n\n\t5.\t\n\n7 -\t\n\nQU.1L1VY\n\n"lleport :.n +.\' 4rseas Trip, = April - 20 May 1977",\nLuth Aust3:L_ ,n Institute of Technology,\nMccloy K. .\t\nAdelaide, July 1977.\n\n(VI) PROBLEMS\n,A-7o main problems have been encountered. The time\ntaken to receive imagery after acquisition meant that\na considerable expenditure of effort was made on collecting\nfield data that subsequently was not required. Quick lookfacilities are essential to ensure the economical use of\nfield staff both during the training and verification stages.\nLack of suitable hardware facilities on the computer\nproved to be expensive in the time resources of the researcher.\nIt also meant that classification results were difficult to\nportray in a way amenable to understanding -the classification.\nIn addition the soil moisture and evapotranspiration\ndata for Konetta Hydrological Station contains apparent\nanomolies which are being currently investigated. As a\nresult the programmed extrapolation of these conditions to\nother parts of the region is additionally subject to this\nrestraint.\n(VII) DATA QUALITY AND DELIVERY\nReference comments elsewhere in this report.\n(VIII) CONCLUSIONS\nWhilst the project has not been completed for the\nreasons given, nevertheless the hypothesis that evapotranspiration and soil moisture measurements at a single\npoint can be extended over a wider area of the region by\ncorrelation with repetitive ERTS Imagery will continue\nto be actively evaluated. If validated, better evaluation\nof subcatchment and basin behaviour should result thus\nenabling an improved definition of regional water resources.\n\nGMCI:EV\n6.10.77\t\n\nENGINEER FOR WATER RESOURCES\n\nt\n\n'
