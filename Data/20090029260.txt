In the original intended application of the algorithm, the desired weak signal is a\nspacecraft telemetry signal, the antennas are spacecraft-tracking antennas in\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Deep Space Network, and the\nsource of the wide-band interfering signal is typically a radio galaxy or a planet\nthat lies along or near the line of sight\nto the spacecraft. The algorithm could\nalso afford the ability to discriminate\nbetween desired narrow-band and\nnearby undesired wide-band sources in\nrelated applications that include satellite and terrestrial radio communications and radio astronomy.\nThe development of the present algorithm involved modification of a prior\nalgorithm called \xe2\x80\x9cSUMPLE\xe2\x80\x9d and a\npredecessor called \xe2\x80\x9cSIMPLE.\xe2\x80\x9d SUMPLE\nwas described in \xe2\x80\x9cAlgorithm for Aligning an Array of Receiving Radio Antennas\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-40574), NASA Tech Briefs Vol.\n30, No. 4 (April 2006), page 54. To recapitulate: As used here, \xe2\x80\x9caligning\xe2\x80\x9d signifies adjusting the delays and phases of\nthe outputs from the various antennas\nso that their relatively weak replicas of\nthe desired signal can be added coherently to increase the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) for improved reception, as\nthough one had a single larger antenna. Prior to the development of\nSUMPLE, it was common practice to effect alignment by means of a process\nthat involves correlation of signals in\npairs. SIMPLE is an example of an algorithm that effects such a process.\nSUMPLE also involves correlations, but\nthe correlations are not performed in\npairs. Instead, in a partly iterative\nprocess, each signal is appropriately\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nTilt Angle, Beam Widths\n\nTilting the Beam of an antenna array in a refinement of the present signal-processing algorithm can\nafford a small gain in SNR of the desired signal. Plotted here are results of a simulation in which the\ndesired and interfering signals were both 5 dB above noise and were coming from the same direction.\n\nweighted and then correlated with a\ncomposite signal equal to the sum of\nthe other signals.\nFor the purpose of the present algorithm, it is assumed that the receiver at\neach antenna is of a multi-channel\ntype, so that its outputs can be\nprocessed to obtain a cross-correlation\nspectrum of the incoming signals. It is\nfurther assumed that the channels are\nconfigured to afford both sufficient\nresolution and sufficient bandwidth to\naccommodate the telemetry or other\ndesired narrow-band signal by use of\nseveral of its inner channels while simultaneously accommodating the\nwide-band interfering signal, devoid of\nsignificant contribution from the desired narrow-band signal, by use of its\nremaining (outer) channels. Under\nthis assumption, pertinent correlation\ncharacteristics of the interfering signal\ncan be calculated by use of data from\nthe outer channels only, then subtracted from the corresponding characteristics of the total signal in the\ninner channels, yielding desired-signal\ncorrelations without the interferer.\nThe calculations include least-squares\nfits of phase-versus-frequency models\n\nfor both the desired and the interfering signals, using all the channels. The\nfitting process enables estimation of\nresidual delays for the desired and interfering signals when there is sufficient signal-to-noise ratio.\nThe algorithm as summarized thus far\nguarantees only that the array is aligned\nto form a pencil beam that points toward\nthe source of the desired signal. The algorithm does not eliminate or reduce\nthe effects of the interfering signal on\nthe overall system noise. The algorithm\ndoes, however, provide an option for further refinement through adjustment of\ncorrelation weights so as to tilt and/or\nreshape the beam (see figure). Depending on the angular distribution of the interferer relative to the desired source\nand on relative strengths of the desired\nsignal, the interfering signal, and noise,\nit may be possible to increase the SNR of\nthe desired signal through such reshaping or tilting.\nThis work was done by Andre P. Jongeling\nof Caltech and David H. Rogstad of Santa\nBarbara Applied Research for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory. For more information, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov. NPO45640\n\n5\n\nCollecting Ground Samples for Balloon-Borne Instruments\nHarpoonlike sample-collection devices would be dropped, then hauled back up.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA proposed system in a gondola containing scientific instruments suspended\nby a balloon over the surface of the Saturn moon Titan would quickly acquire\nsamples of rock or ice from the ground\nbelow. Prototypes of a sample-collecting\ndevice that would be a major part of the\nsystem have been tested under cryogenic\nand non-cryogenic conditions on Earth.\nSystems like this one could also be used\nin non-cryogenic environments on\nEarth to collect samples of rock, soil, ice,\nmud, or other ground material from\nsuch inaccessible or hazardous locations\nas sites of suspected chemical spills or biological contamination.\nThe sample-collecting device would\nbe a harpoonlike device that would be\nconnected to the balloon-borne gondola\nby a tether long enough to reach the\nground (see Figure 1). The device would\nbe dropped from the gondola to acquire\na sample, then would be reeled back up\nto the gondola, where the sample would\nbe analyzed by the onboard instruments.\nEach prototype of the sample-collecting device (see Figure 2) has a sharp front\n(lower) end, a hollow core for retaining a\nsample, a spring (not shown in the figure)\nfor holding the sample in the hollow core,\nand a rear (upper) annular cavity for retaining liquid sample material. Aerodynamic fins at the rear help to keep the\nfront end pointed downward. In tests,\nthese prototype devices were dropped\nfrom various heights and used to gather\nsamples of dry sand, moist sand, cryogenic water ice, and warmer water ice.\nThis work was done by Jack Jones, Wayne\nZimmerman, and Jiunn Jenq Wu of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1).\nNPO-44444\n\nBalloon\n\nGondola\n\nTether\nSampleCollecting\nDevice\n\nFigure 1. A Tethered Sample-Collecting Device would be dropped from a balloon-borne gondola to collect a sample of ground material, then reeled back up to the gondola to enable analysis of the sample.\n\nFigure 2. These Prototype Sample-Collecting Devices are basically harpoons with smooth, sharp front\nends, rear stabilizing fins, and interior cavities for capturing and retaining samples.\n\nTethered Pyrotechnic Apparatus for Acquiring a Ground Sample\nA tethered projectile would be pyrotechnically driven into the ground.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA proposed alternative design for the\nballoon-borne ground-sampling system\ndescribed in the immediately preceding\narticle would not rely on free fall to\ndrive a harpoonlike sample-collecting\ndevice into the ground. Instead, the\n\n6\n\nharpoon-like sample-collecting device\nwould be a pyrotechnically driven, tethered projectile.\nThe apparatus would include a tripod\nthat would be tethered to the gondola. A\ngun for shooting the projectile into the\n\nground would be mounted at the apex\nof the tripod (see figure). The gun\nwould include an electronic trigger circuit, a chamber at the breech end containing a pyrotechnic charge, and a barrel. A sabot would be placed in the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nElectronic Trigger Circuit\n\nPyrotechnic Charge\nHarpoonlike\nSample-Collecting\nDevice\n(Tethered Projectile)\n\nSabot\n\nTripod\nLeg\n\nTripod\nLeg\nBarrel\n\nGround/Contact Sensors\n\nA Gun Aimed Downward From the Top of a Tripod would fire a tethered projectile into the ground\nto collect a sample when all three feet of the tripod simultaneously touch the ground.\n\nbarrel just below the pyrotechnic\ncharge, and the tethered projectile\nwould be placed in the barrel just below\nthe sabot. The tripod feet would be\nequipped with contact sensors connected to the trigger circuit.\nIn operation, the tripod would be lowered to the ground on its tether. Once\ncontact with the ground was detected by\nthe sensors on all three tripod feet, the\ntrigger circuit would fire the pyrotechnic\ncharge to drive the projectile into the\nground. (Requiring contact among all\nthree tripod feet and the ground would\nensure that the projectile would be fired\ninto the ground, rather than up toward\nthe gondola or the balloon.) The tethered projectile would then be reeled\nback up to the gondola for analysis of the\nsample.\nThis work was done by Jack Jones, Wayne\nZimmerman, Jiunn Jenq Wu, Mircea Badescu,\nand Stewart Sherrit of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA previously developed video-oculography system has been enhanced for use\nin measuring vestibulo-ocular reflexes of\na human subject in a centrifuge, motor\nvehicle, or other setting. The system as\npreviously developed included a lightweight digital video camera mounted on\ngoggles. The left eye was illuminated by\nan infrared light-emitting diode via a\ndichroic mirror, and the camera captured images of the left eye in infrared\nlight. To extract eye-movement data, the\ndigitized video images were processed by\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nsoftware running in a laptop computer.\nEye movements were calibrated by having the subject view a target pattern,\nfixed with respect to the subject\xe2\x80\x99s head,\ngenerated by a goggle-mounted laser\nwith a diffraction grating.\nThe system as enhanced includes a\nsecond camera for imaging the scene\nfrom the subject\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, and two\ninertial measurement units (IMUs) for\nmeasuring linear accelerations and\nrates of rotation for computing head\nmovements. One IMU is mounted on\n\nthe goggles, the other on the centrifuge\nor vehicle frame. All eye-movement and\nhead-motion data are time-stamped. In\naddition, the subject\xe2\x80\x99s point of regard is\nsuperimposed on each scene image to\nenable analysis of patterns of gaze in\nreal time.\nThis work was done by Steven T.

MSC-23957-1\n\n7\n\nElectronics/Computers\nJoint Carrier-Phase Synchronization and LDPC Decoding\nSoft feedback from an LDPC decoder would enhance performance of a PLL.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method has been proposed to increase the degree of synchronization of a\nradio receiver with the phase of a suppressed carrier signal modulated with a binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK) or quaternary-phase-shift-keying (QPSK) signal\nrepresenting a low-density parity-check\n(LDPC) code. This method is an extended version of the method described in\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsing LDPC Code Constraints to Aid Recovery of Symbol Timing\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-43112),\nNASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 32, No. 10 (October\n2008), page 54. Both methods and the receiver architectures in which they would\nbe implemented belong to a class of timing-recovery methods and corresponding\nreceiver architectures characterized as pilotless in that they do not require transmission and reception of pilot signals.\nThe proposed method calls for the use\nof what is known in the art as soft decision\nfeedback to remove the modulation from\na replica of the incoming signal prior to\nfeeding this replica to a phase-locked\nloop (PLL) or other carrier-tracking\n\nportional to the cosine and sine of the\ncarrier phase \xce\xb8c as well as correlated\nnoise components. These products\nwould be fed as inputs to a digital PLL\nthat would include a number-controlled\noscillator (NCO), which provides an esti\xcb\x86\nmate of the carrier phase, \xce\xb8c .\nThis work was done by Marvin Simon and\nChristopher Jones of Caltech and Esteban\nValles of the University of California, Los Angeles, for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

Unlike a related prior method in\nwhich hard decision feedback (the final\nsequence of decoded symbols) is used to\nremove the modulation, the proposed\nmethod does not require estimation of\nthe decoder error probability.\nIn a basic digital implementation of\nthe proposed method (see figure), the incoming signal (having carrier phase \xce\xb8c)\nplus noise would first be converted to inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband\nsignals by mixing it with I and Q signals at\nthe carrier frequency [\xcf\x89c/(2\xcf\x80)] generated by a local oscillator. The resulting\ndemodulated signals would be processed\nthrough one-symbol-period integrateand-dump filters, the outputs of which\nwould be sampled and held, then multiplied by a soft-decision version of the\nbaseband modulated signal.

Dualpolarization, sideband-separating, and\nbalanced-output receivers are well-known\nand have been used extensively at frequencies up to about 100 GHz; and there\nwas an earlier proposal for such a receiver\nfor frequencies up to 900 GHz. However,\nthe present proposal represents the first\nrealistic design concept for such a receiver capable of operating above 1 THz.\nThe proposed receiver is intended to be a\nprototype of mass-producible receiver\nunits, operating at frequencies up to 6\nTHz, that would be incorporated into\nhighly sensitive heterodyne array instru-\n\nments to be used in astronomical spectroscopic and imaging studies.\nThe receiver architecture (see Figure\n1) as proposed is based on discrete single-ended mixers and conventional\nwaveguides with integrated planar circuitry. The receiver would include a finline orthomode transducer (OMT) followed by six quadrature hybrids on a\nplane (see Figure 2). An incoming\nradio-frequency (RF) signal would enter\nvia a horn antenna. An orthomode\ntransducer (OMT) would separate the\nincoming RF signal into its two orthogonal linearly polarized components. One\nof the outputs will go through a waveguide polarization twist and that will enable the subsequent components to have\nthe same E-field orientation. Each of\nthese polarizations would be fed to a\nfirst-stage quadrature hybrid. The out-\n\nSecond-Stage\nQuadrature Hybrid\n(One of Four)\n\nputs of each first-stage quadrature hybrid, which would be in phase quadrature, would be fed along with a local-oscillator (LO) signal to two second-stage\nquadrature hybrids. The combined LO\nand RF signals coming out of the second-stage quadrature hybrids would\npump two sets of mixers in a balanced\nconfiguration. The intermediate-frequency (IF) outputs of the mixers would\nbe combined in third-stage quadrature\nhybrids to separate the upper and lower\nsidebands for each polarization.\nThe critical components in the\nplanned development of the proposed\nreceiver would be the OMT, the firstand second-stage quadrature hybrids,\nand the polarization twist. Previously, it\nwas almost impossible to design, simulate, and fabricate such components\nfor operation at terahertz frequencies:\n\nMixer Bias +\nIF\n\nRF + LO\nMixer Bias \xe2\x80\x93\n\nCold\nLoad\n\nRF\n\nUpper Sideband,\nVertical Polarization\n\nLO\n\nLower Sideband,\nVertical Polarization\n\nLO\n\nRF\n\nIn-Phase\nPower Splitter\n(One of Two)\n\nLO\n\nRF,\nVertical\nPolarization\n\nMixer Bias +\nIF\n\nRF + LO\nHorn\nRF In\n\nFirst-Stage\nQuadrature\nHybrids\n\nMixer Bias +\n\nOMT\n\nIF\n\nRF + LO\nRF,\nHorizontal\nPolarization\n\nCold\nLoad\n\nThird-Stage\nQuadrature\nHybrids\n\nMixer Bias \xe2\x80\x93\n\nMixer Bias \xe2\x80\x93\nRF\n\nLower Sideband,\nHorizontal Polarization\n\nLO\n\nUpper Sideband,\nHorizontal Polarization\n\nLO\n\nRF\nLO\n\nMixer Bias +\nIF\n\nRF + LO\nMixer Bias \xe2\x80\x93\n\nFigure 1.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA new approach to masterless, distributed, digital-charge control for batteries requiring charge control has\nbeen developed and implemented.\nThis approach is required in battery\nchemistries that need cell-level charge\ncontrol for safety and is characterized\nby the use of one controller per cell,\nresulting in redundant sensors for critical components, such as voltage, temperature, and current. The charge\ncontrollers in a given battery interact\nin a masterless fashion for the purpose\nof cell balancing, charge control, and\nstate-of-charge estimation. This makes\nthe battery system invariably fault-tolerant.\nThe solution to the single-fault failure, due to the use of a single charge\ncontroller (CC), was solved by implementing one CC per cell and linking\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nA prototype of the 28-V, 60-A-h Lithium Ion Battery.\n\nthem via an isolated communication\nbus [e.g., controller area network\n(CAN)] in a masterless fashion so that\n\nthe failure of one or more CCs will not\nimpact the remaining functional CCs.\nEach microcontroller-based CC digitizes the cell voltage (Vcell), two cell\ntemperatures, and the voltage across\nthe switch (V); the latter variable is\nused in conjunction with Vcell to estimate the bypass current for a given bypass resistor. Furthermore, CC1 digitizes the battery current (I 1 ) and\nbattery voltage (Vbatt) and CC5 digitizes a second battery current (I2). As a\nresult, redundant readings are taken\nfor temperature, battery current, and\nbattery voltage through the summation of the individual cell voltages\ngiven that each CC knows the voltage\nof the other cells.\nFor the purpose of cell balancing,\neach CC periodically and independently\ntransmits its cell voltage and stores the\n\n11\n\nreceived cell voltage of the other cells in\nan array. The position in the array depends on the identifier (ID) of the transmitting CC. After eight cell voltage receptions, the array is checked to see if\none or more cells did not transmit. If\none or more transmissions are missing,\nthe missing cell(s) is (are) eliminated\nfrom cell-balancing calculations.\nThe cell-balancing algorithm is\nbased on the error between the cell\xe2\x80\x99s\nvoltage and the other cells and is categorized into four zones of operation.\nThe algorithm is executed every sec-\n\nond and, if cell balancing is activated,\nthe error variable is set to a negative\nlow value. The largest error between\nthe cell and the other cells is found\nand the zone of operation determined.\nIf the error is zero or negative, then the\ncell is at the lowest voltage and no balancing action is needed.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe use of hybridized carbon/silicon\ncarbide (C/SiC) fabric to reinforce ceramic matrix composite face sheets and\nthe integration of such face sheets with\na foam core creates a sandwich structure capable of withstanding high-heatflux environments (150 W/cm2) in\nwhich the core provides a temperature\ndrop of 1,000 \xc2\xb0C between the surface\nand the back face without cracking or\ndelamination of the structure. The\ncomposite face sheet exhibits a bilinear\nresponse, which results from the SiC\nmatrix not being cracked on fabrication. In addition, the structure exhibits\ndamage tolerance under impact with\nprojectiles, showing no penetration to\nthe back face sheet. These attributes\nmake the composite ideal for leadingedge structures and control surfaces in\naerospace vehicles, as well as for\nacreage thermal protection systems and\nin high-temperature, lightweight stiffened structures.\nBy tailoring the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of a carbon fibercontaining ceramic matrix composite\n(CMC) face sheet to match that of a ceramic foam core, the face sheet and the\ncore can be integrally fabricated without any delamination. Carbon and SiC\nare woven together in the reinforcing\n\nThe Foam Core Ceramic Matrix Composite is a\nweave SiC and carbon fiber, which allows heat\ndissipation in-plane. Face sheet thickness is nominally 2.4 mm, and core thickness is 1.26 cm.\n\nfabric. Integral densification of the\nCMC and the foam core is accomplished with chemical vapor deposition,\neliminating the need for bond-line adhesive. This means there is no need to\nseparately fabricate the core and the\nface sheet, or to bond the two elements\ntogether, risking edge delamination\nduring use.\nFibers of two or more types are woven\ntogether on a loom. The carbon and ceramic fibers are pulled into the same\n\xe2\x80\x9cpick\xe2\x80\x9d location during the weaving\nprocess. Tow spacing may be varied to\naccommodate the increased volume of\nthe combined fiber tows while maintain-\n\ning a target fiber volume fraction in the\ncomposite. Foam pore size, strut thickness, and ratio of face sheet to core\nthickness can be used to tailor thermal\nand mechanical properties. The anticipated CTE for the hybridized composite\nis managed by the choice of constituents, varying fiber tow sizes and constituent part ratios.\nThis structural concept provides high\nstrength and stiffness at low density \xe2\x80\x94\n1.06 g/cm3 in panels tested. Varieties of\nface sheet constructions are possible, including variations in fiber type and\nweave geometry. The integrated structures possible with this composite could\neliminate the need for non-load-bearing\nthermal protection systems on top of a\nstructural component. The back sheet\ncan readily be integrated to substructures through the incorporation of ribs.\nThis would eliminate weight and cost for\naerospace missions.\nThis work was done by Frances I.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA system has been designed to reduce the hydrogen molecule content in\ninert gases that are used for shielding\nthe welding arc and molten weld area\nduring the manual fusion, automated\nwelding, and induction brazing\nprocess. Two desiccant pipeline dryer\ncartridges are connected together\nusing either aircraft or KC .250 fittings,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nand are installed in-line between the\ninert-gas facility source (argon and helium) and the welding machine. This\nprocess helps maintain alloy grain\nstructure and integrity to engineering\nspecifications during the welding and\nbrazing processes. Also, this method enhances weldability when joining similar\nand dissimilar alloys. It is easy to restore\n\nthe system to original drying capabilities by using a nitrogen purge or by\noven drying. This design has low schedule impact or down time when being installed on machines or in systems.\nThere is also a sight glass to indicate\nwhen servicing is needed.\nReducing the moisture level in ultrahigh-purity gasses also lowers costs. The\n\n15\n\ntotal cost of the system described here\nwas less than $1,000 (at the time of this\nreporting). It has been in operation for\n4.5 years with no maintenance or drying.\nThe last test of the system indicated the\ngas moisture level was less than 2 ppm,\nwith a dew point of less than \xe2\x80\x9397 \xc2\xbaF (\xe2\x80\x9372\n\xc2\xbaC). Before the line dryers were installed,\nthe inlet gases had a moisture rating of\n15 ppm. With the installation of a one-\n\ncanister system, the inert gas moisture\nlevel dropped to 3 ppm. When a two-canister system was installed, the inert gas\nmoisture level dropped to 0.7 ppm.\nThese two pipeline dryers also act as a\nmixing chamber for both argon and helium gases, which is crucial for applications of certain critical welding processes.\nThis innovation is applicable to any\nprocess or system that requires a reduction\n\nof any inert gas moisture level (in ppm). It\nmay also be used in any process or system,\nsuch as avionics, that uses inert gases with\na low moisture level requirement of 1 ppm\nor lower, depending on the cubic feet per\nminute (CFM) flow rate.\nThis work was done by Jerry Goudy of\nUnited Space Alliance for Kennedy Space\nCenter.

Copper nanotubes are under consideration as alternatives to copper nanorods and nanowires\nfor applications involving thermal\nand/or electrical contacts, wherein the\ngreater specific areas of nanotubes could\nafford lower effective thermal and/or\nelectrical resistivities. Heretofore, copper\nnanorods and nanowires have been fabricated by a combination of electrodeposition and a conventional expensive lithographic\nprocess.\nThe\npresent\nelectrodeposition-based process for fabricating copper nanotubes costs less and\nenables production of copper nanotubes\nat greater rate.\nThe demonstration of this process\nbegan with the selection of alumina\n\n16\n\nmembranes containing pores having diameters in the approximate range of\n100 to 200 nm. The estimated porosity\nof these membranes was 43 percent.\nEach of these membranes was evaporation-coated on one side with a 100-nmthick gold film to render that side electrically conductive. Each membrane\nwas then mounted on a gold-coated silicon substrate by use of adhesive tape,\nand the substrate was carefully masked\nwith tape to prevent electrodeposition\non the substrate. Next, the membraneand-substrate unit was immersed for\nabout 10 minutes in a solution comprising 4 volume parts of water and 1 volume part of a potassium-based,\nbuffered developer solution commonly\nused in lithography. The purpose and\neffect of this immersion was to render\nthe surfaces of the pores electrically\nconductive.\n\nNext, electrodeposition into the pores\nwas performed at room temperature in a\ncommercially available copper-plating\nsolution, using platinum-coated titanium mesh counter electrodes and galvanostatic control set to a current density of, variously, 10 or 20 mA/cm2.\nCopper nanotubes were thus formed in\nthe pores at a deposition rate of 100\nnm/min at the current density of 10\nmA/cm2 or 150 nm/min at the current\ndensity of 20 mA/cm2.\nThis work was done by E.

In the case of a coal car, this involves\ninserting a small number (typically between two and four) of vertical full-depth\nor partial-depth panels. For example, as\nshown in Figure 1, two triangular partialdepth vertical panels can be conveniently\nattached to triangular braces that are already integral parts of a typical coal car.\nIn an experiment, measurements of\naerodynamic drag on models of coal\ncars were made in a wind tunnel. The results of the measurements, summarized\nin Figure 2, clearly show the drag-reducing effects of the dividers; they also show\nthat the braces also contribute small reductions of drag.\nThis work was done by James C.

These\napparatuses have been designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. In\n\nthe case of the rotary percussive autogopher, the emphasis would be on developing an apparatus capable of penetrating to, and acquiring samples at,\ndepths that could otherwise be reached\n\n17\n\nonly by use of much longer, heavier,\nconventional drilling-and-sampling apparatuses.\nTo recapitulate from the prior articles about USDCs: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power\njackhammer in which a piezoelectrically driven actuator generates ultrasonic vibrations and is coupled to a\ntool bit through a free mass. The\nbouncing of the free mass between the\nactuator horn and the drill bit converts\nthe actuator ultrasonic vibrations into\nsonic hammering of the drill bit. The\ncombination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at\nthe tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and\nchiseling actions are so effective that\nthe size of the axial force needed to\nmake the tool bit advance into soil,\nrock, or another material of interest is\nmuch smaller than in ordinary rotary\ndrilling, ordinary hammering, or ordinary steady pushing.\nThe predecessor of the rotary percussive auto-gopher is an apparatus,\nnow denoted an ultrasonic/sonic gopher and previously denoted an ultrasonic gopher, described in \xe2\x80\x9cUltrasonic/Sonic Mechanism for Drilling\nand Coring\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-30291), NASA Tech\nBriefs Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003),\npage 65.

By\nuse of a cable suspended from a reel\non the surface, the gopher is lifted\nfrom the hole to remove a core sample, then lowered into the hole to resume the advance and acquire the\nnext core sample.\nThe rotary percussive auto-gopher\nwould include an ultrasonic/sonic gopher, to which would be added an anchoring and a rotary mechanism and\na fluted drill bit (see figure). If, as intended, the ultrasonic/sonic gopher\nwere rotated, then as in the case of an\nordinary twist drill bit, the flutes\nwould remove cuttings from the end\nof the hole, thereby making it possible to drill much faster than would be\npossible by ultrasonic/sonic hammering and chiseling action alone. The\nanchoring mechanism would brace itself against the wall of the drilled hole\nto enable the rotary mechanism to\napply a small torque and a small axial\npreload to rotate the ultrasonic/sonic\ngopher drill bit and push the drill bit\nagainst the end of the hole. The anchoring and rotary mechanisms\nwould be parts of an assembly that\nwould follow the ultrasonic/sonic gopher down the hole.\nThis work was done by Yoseph Bar-Cohen,\nMircea Badescu, and Stewart Sherrit of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). NPO-45949\n\nMore About Reconfigurable Exploratory Robotic Vehicles\nEssential to reconfigurability is modularity of hardware and software.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nModular exploratory robotic vehicles\nthat will be able to reconfigure themselves in the field are undergoing development.

Proposed for\nuse in exploration of the surfaces of\nMars and other remote planets, these vehicles and others of similar design could\nalso be useful for exploring hostile terrain on Earth.\nTo recapitulate from the cited prior\narticle: the modular vehicles are de-\n\n18\n\nnoted generally by the term Axeln,\nwhere n is an even number equal to the\nnumber of main wheels. The simplest vehicle of this type is Axel2 \xe2\x80\x94 a two-mainwheel module that superficially resembles the rear axle plus rear wheels of an\nautomobile (see Figure 1). In addition\nto the two main wheels, an Axel2 includes a passive caster wheel attached to\nthe axle by an actuated caster link. The\nmotion of the caster link can be used to\ncontrol the rotation of the axle in order\nto tilt, to the desired angle, any sensors\nmounted on the axle. In addition to the\nsensors, the axle of an Axel2 houses\n\ncomputer modules and three motors\nand associated mechanisms for driving\nthe main wheels and the caster link. An\nAxel2 is powered by rechargeable batteries located inside the wheel hubs.\nOne constructs an Axeln (n > 2) as an\nassembly of multiple Axel2s plus one or\nmore instrument module(s) connected\nto each other at module interfaces (see\nFigure 2). The module interfaces contain standardized electrical and mechanical connections, including springloaded universal joints that afford some\ncompliance to enable the modules to rotate, relative to each other, to adapt to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nterrain. Data are communicated between modules via fast serial links in\nthe module interfaces.\nAn Axeln amounts to a train carrying\nn/2 \xe2\x80\x93 1 instrument modules. The instrument modules contain additional\ncomputational units that, in addition\nto processing of instrument readings,\ncontribute to coordination of motion.\nIn other words, the \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence\xe2\x80\x9d of an\nAxeln, and thus the sophistication of\nthe maneuvers that it can perform, increase with n. The symmetrical design\nof the modules enables them to operate in any stable orientation, including\nupsidedown; this feature contributes to\nrobustness of operation in rough terrain. A fully developed Axeln would be\nable to diagnose itself to detect nonfunctional modules.\nGoing beyond the description in\nthe cited prior article, the following\nadditional major items of the hardware can now be reported.\nAlso contained within the axle of\nan Axel2 is a stereoscopic pair of electronic cameras to be used for navigation across terrain, for scientific observations, and for guidance in\ndocking maneuvers.\nEach module interface is an electromechanical module located at the midlength of the axle of an Axel2. The\nmodule interface carries female parts\nof mating mechanisms, while instrument modules carry the male parts.\nThe mating mechanisms include conical mating surfaces that correct for\nsmall initial misalignments to facilitate\n\nFigure 1.

To enable selfdiagnosis and automatic reconfiguration of modular hardware, the architecture of the Axeln software provides\nfor autonomous adaptation of the\nsoftware to the hardware reconfiguration. More specifically, an Axeln uses\nsoftware that can determine when\nphysical reconfiguration is necessary\n(e.g., in response to task requirements\nor hardware failures), controls the\nhardware reconfiguration, and reconfigures itself to conform to the\nchanged hardware configuration.\nThe capability for autonomous reconfiguration of the hardware depends heavily on the supporting software. One of the goals of the\ndevelopment of the Axeln system is\nto simplify and generalize through\nmodularity. The reconfigurable software architecture mirrors the modularity of the hardware by providing\nthat, as hardware modules are connected or disconnected, associated\nsoftware modules are also put into or\ntaken out of operation.\nThis work was done by Ayanna Howard,\nIssa Nesnas, Barry Werger, Daniel Helmick\nof Caltech; Murray Clark and Raymond\nChristian of Arkansas Tech; and Raymond\nCipra of Purdue University for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Valves like these could\nalso be useful in terrestrial temperatureregulation systems, including automobile\nair-conditioning systems and general refrigeration systems. These valves are required to provide smoother actuation\nover a wider temperature range than the\nflow-splitting, thermally actuated spool\nvalves used in the Mars Explorer Rover\n(MER). Also, whereas the MER valves are\nunstable (tending to oscillate) in certain\ntransition temperature ranges, these\nvalves are required not to oscillate.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nThe MER valves are actuated by thermal expansion of a wax against springloaded piston rods (as in common automotive thermostats). The MSL valves\ncontain similar actuators that utilize thermal expansion of a silicone oil, because\nsilicone-oil actuators were found to afford\ngreater and more nearly linear displacements, needed for smoother actuation,\nover the required wider temperature\nrange. The MSL valves also feature improved spool designs that reflect greater\nunderstanding of fluid dynamics, consideration of pressure drops in valves, and a\nrequirement for balancing of pressures in\ndifferent flow branches.\nThis work was done by Pradeep Bhandari,\nGajanana C.

Similar enhancement techniques\nhave been used for convective heat\ntransfer, but, to the best knowledge at\nthe time of this reporting, never spray\ncooling of foam. Previous studies have\nshown that spray-cooling heat flux enhancements may be attained using enhanced surfaces. However, most enhanced surface spray-cooling studies\nhave been limited to extended and/or\nembedded surface structures. This\n\nstudy investigates the effect of foam on\nspraycooling heat flux.\nThe foam used was graphite Poco Foam.\nThe foam piece was attached to a copper\nblock with a cross-sectional area of 2 cm2\nusing high-thermal-conductivity epoxy as\nthe thermal interface material. Measurements were also obtained on a heater block\nwith a flat surface for purposes of baseline\ncomparison. A 2\xc3\x972 nozzle array was used\nwith PF-5060 as the working fluid. Thermal\nperformance data was obtained under\nnominally degassed conditions, with a\nchamber pressure of 41.4 kPa.\n\nResults show that the highest heat flux\nattained was 113 W/cm2 using the graphite\nPoco Foam. The use of the foam does not\nrequire a significant amount of time dedicated to machining the heat exchange surface, and thus is a time-efficient enhancement technique. In addition, with foam,\nthe thermally controlled surface does not\nexperience abrupt catastrophic failure.\nThis work was done by Eric A. Silk of Goddard Space Flight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA chemical treatment reduces the\nconvective and radiative contributions to the effective thermal conductivity of porous fibrous thermal-insulation tile. The net effect of the\ntreatment is to coat the surfaces of\nfibers with a mixture of transitionmetal oxides (TMOs) without filling\nthe pores. The TMO coats reduce the\ncross-sectional areas available for convection while absorbing and scattering thermal radiation in the pores,\nthereby rendering the tile largely\nopaque to thermal radiation.\nThe treatment involves a sol-gel\nprocess: A solution containing a mixture of transition-metal-oxide-precur-\n\nsor salts plus a gelling agent (e.g.,\ntetraethylorthosilicate) is partially\ncured, then, before it visibly gels, is\nused to impregnate the tile. The solution in the tile is gelled, then dried,\nand then the tile is fired to convert the\nprecursor salts to the desired mixed\nTMO phases. The amounts of the various TMOs ultimately incorporated into\nthe tile can be tailored via the concentrations of salts in the solution, and the\nimpregnation depth can be tailored via\nthe viscosity of the solution and/or the\nvolume of the solution relative to that\nof the tile. The amounts of the TMOs\ndetermine the absorption and scattering spectra.\n\nThis work was done by Alfred Zinn and\nRyan Tarkanian of The Boeing Co. for Johnson Space Center.

What is\n\n21\n\nnew here is the selection of\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 particles as candidate\nopacifiers that, in comparison with\nsome prior opacifiers (carbon black\nand metal nanoparticles), are more\nthermally stable.\nThe preparation of a composite material of the present type includes synthesis of the silica-aerogel component\nin\na\nsol-gel\nprocess.\nThe\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 particles, made previously in a separate process, are mixed\ninto the sol, which is then cast onto\nfused-quartz-fiber batting. Then the\naerogel-casting solution is poured into\nthe mold, where it permeates the silica\nfiber felt. After the sol has gelled, the\ncasting is aged and then subjected to\nsupercritical drying to convert the gel\nto the final aerogel form.\n\nThe separate process for making the\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 particles begins with the\nslow addition of corresponding proportions\nof La(CH3COOH)3, Mn(CH3COOH)3,\nand Sr(NO3)2 to a solution of H2O2 in\nH2O. The solution is then peptized by\ndrop-wise addition of NH4OH to obtain\na sol. Next, the sol is dried in an oven at\na temperature of 120 \xc2\xb0C to obtain a\nglassy solid. The solid is calcined at 700\n\xc2\xb0C to convert it to La0.7Sr0.3MnO3. Then\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 particles are made by\nball-milling the calcined solid.\nThe effectiveness of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3\nparticles as opacifiers and thermal-conductivity reducers depends on the statistical distribution of particle sizes as well\nas the relative proportions of\nLa0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and aerogel. For experiments performed thus far, samples of\n\naerogel/fiber composites were formulated to have, variously, silica target density\nof 0.07 or 0.14 g/cm3 and to contain 30\npercent of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 in average particle size of 0.3 or 3 \xc2\xb5m. The thermal conductivities of the samples containing the 3\xc2\xb5m La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 particles were\nfound to be lower than those of the\nsamples containing the 0.3-\xc2\xb5m\nLa 0.7 Sr 0.3 MnO 3 particles. The optimum particle size is believed to be\nbetween 1 and 5 \xc2\xb5m.\nThis work was done by Wendell Rhine,\nAndrew Polli, and Kiranmayi Deshpande\nof Aspen Aerogels, Inc. for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe next generation of reusable\nlaunch vehicles is likely to use GRCop-84\n[Cu-8(at.%)Cr-4%Nb] copper alloy\ncombustion liners. The application of\nprotective coatings on GRCop-84 liners\ncan minimize or eliminate many of the\nenvironmental problems experienced\nby uncoated liners and significantly extend their operational lives and lower\noperational cost. A newly developed Cu23 (wt.%) Cr-5% Al (CuCrAl) coating,\nshown to resist hydrogen attack and oxidation in an as-cast form, is currently\nbeing considered as a protective coating\nfor GRCop-84. The coating was deposited on GRCop-84 substrates by the\ncold spray deposition technique, where\nthe CuCrAl was procured as gas-atom-\n\nized powders. Cyclic oxidation tests\nwere conducted between 773 and 1,073\nK to characterize the coated substrates.\nThe coating proved to be effective in\npreventing the cyclic oxidation of the\nsubstrate for up to 1,000 cycles. The\ncoated substrates showed no significant weight loss in comparison to uncoated specimens, which lost between\n60 to 80 percent of its original weight\nwith much lower lives. The coating was\nadherent to the substrate at all temperatures, whereas the uncoated GRCop84 showed excessive spallation of the\noxide scale. It is anticipated that the\nuse of this alloy can extend the operational life of the liner, which translates\nto increased component reliability,\n\nshorter depot maintenance turnaround time, and lower operational\ncost. Additionally, engines using CuCrAl-coated GRCop-84 combustion liners could operate at higher temperatures, thereby resulting in its increased\nthermal efficiency.\nThis work was done by Sai Raj of Glenn\nResearch Center and J.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThis invention is intended for use as a\nload-bearing device under cryogenic\ntemperatures and/or abrasive conditions (i.e., during missions to the\nMoon). The innovation consists of small-\n\n22\n\ndiameter, ceramic fibers that are woven\nor braided into devices like ropes, belts,\ntracks, or cables. The fibers can be\nformed from a variety of ceramic materials like silicon carbide, carbon, alumi-\n\nnosilicate, or aluminum oxide. The fiber\narchitecture of the weave or braid is determined by both the fiber properties\nand the mechanical requirements of the\napplication. A variety of weave or braid\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\narchitectures is possible for this application. Thickness of load-bearing devices\ncan be achieved by using either a 3D\nwoven structure, or a layered, 2D structure. For the prototype device, a belt approximately 0.10 in. (0.25 cm) thick,\nand 3.0 in. (7.6 cm) wide was formed by\nlayering and stitching a 2D aluminosilicate fiber weave. The circumferential\nlength of the 2D, layered belt was approximately 36 in. (91 cm).\nTo demonstrate the resistance to abrasion while under load, the ceramic fiber\nbelt was installed on two aluminum\nspools that were mounted in an Instron\nload frame. Both spools were completely\nenclosed in a Lexan box within the load\nframe. Bearings were used at each end\nof the spool shafts to allow the spools to\nspin freely while a load was applied. The\nlower spool, which was secured to the\nstationary head of the load frame, was\nalso attached to a small motor to drive\nthe rollers. The upper spool was attached to the movable crosshead of the\n\nInstron frame to apply a load to the belt\nwhile it was rolling. JSC1a, a highly abrasive lunar regolith simulant, was added\nto the Lexan box. Enough JSC1a was\nplaced in the bottom of the box to allow\nthe belt to contact and pick up the dust\nas it traveled around the lower spool.\nThe track was exposed to the dust while\nrolling under load for several hours to\nsimulate relevant rover mission duration. After 12.5 hours of exposure to the\nlunar simulant, under loads varying between 50 and 100 N, no elongation or\nmechanical creep of the belt was measured. Under these loads, which were estimated to be comparable to those required for tracks on the lunar rover,\nthere was no deformation or loss of load\ncarrying ability.\nTo demonstrate flexibility under cryogenic conditions, individual fibers and\nfiber tows were exposed to cryogenic\ntemperatures by being submerged in liquid nitrogen for 4 minutes, and then\nwere flexure tested. Immediately upon\n\nremoval from the liquid nitrogen, the\nfibers and tows were wrapped around\nmandrels of progressively smaller diameters. Both the fibers and the tows were\nsuccessfully wrapped around wire mandrels with a diameter of approximately\n0.02 in. (0.5 mm) without any breakage.\nThe continuous ceramic belt that is envisioned for the lunar rover would be a\nclosed-edge, multilayer weave with\nthrough thickness holes woven in place.\nThe holes in the weave would engage\nthe sprockets on the drive mechanism of\nthe track device.\nThis work was done by Martha H.\nJaskowiak and Andrew J.

Because of the submicron electrode separation, even a potential of only\n1 V applied between the electrodes gives\nrise to an electric field with a strength of\nin excess of a megavolt per meter \xe2\x80\x94\nstrong enough to ionize any gas molecules passing through the holes.\nAn accelerator grid and an electrostatic deflector focus the ions from the\nfield ionizer into the rotating-field cell of\nthe RFMS. The potentials applied to the\nelectrodes of the cell to generate the ro-\n\ntating electric field typically range from 1\nto 13 V. The ions travel in well-defined\nhelices within this cell, after which they\nare collected in a Faraday cup. The mass\nof most of the molecules reaching the\nFaraday cup decreases with increasing\nfrequency of rotation of the electric field\nin the cell. Therefore, the frequency of\nrotation of the electric field is made to\nvary in order to scan through a desired\nrange of ion masses: For example, lightweight gas molecules are scanned at frequencies in the megahertz range, while\nDNA and other large organic molecules\nare scanned at kilohertz frequencies.\nThe current of accelerated ions is attenuated by collisions between these\nions and the much slower (thermal)\nbackground gas molecules. In a typical\ncase of operation at 5 Torr, an initial\nion-beam current of about 10 nA would\nbe attenuated to about 40 pA.

Stated from a slightly different perspective, the effect of\nmodifications is to enable the averaged\nLITS readings to settle to their longterm stability over a shorter total observation time.\nThe basic principles of a LITS were\ndiscussed in several NASA Tech Briefs articles. Here are recapitulated only\nthose items of background information necessary to place the present\nmodifications in context. A LITS includes a microwave local oscillator, the\nfrequency of which is stabilized by\ncomparison with the frequency of a\nground-state hyperfine transition of\n\n26\n\n199Hg+\n\nions. In a LITS of the type to\nwhich the modifications apply, the\ncomparison involves a combination of\noptical and microwave excitation and\ninterrogation of the ions in two\ncollinear ion traps: a quadrupole trap\nwherein the optical excitation used for\nstate preparation and detection takes\nplace, and a multipole (e.g., 12-pole)\ntrap wherein the microwave interrogation of the \xe2\x80\x9cclock\xe2\x80\x9d transition takes\nplace. The ions are initially loaded\ninto the quadrupole trap and are\nthereafter shuttled between the two\ntraps. This concludes the background\ninformation.\nOne source of systematic frequency\nerror is an AC Stark shift caused by light\npresent during microwave interrogation. To minimize this source of error,\nmost stray light is suppressed by design,\nand heretofore, the microwave-interrogation time has been limited to the dim\nportion of the bimodal lamp cycle. It has\nnow been learned that it is not necessary\nto limit the microwave interrogation to\nthe dim portion of the lamp cycle because the separation of the two collinear\nion traps is such that very little light\nfrom the lamp reaches the multipole\n\ntrap wherein the microwave interrogation takes place. Indeed, the lamp-lightattenuation factor associated with the\nseparation of the collinear ion traps is\ngreater than the ratio between the\nbright and dim lamp intensities. The\nabandonment of this limitation creates\nan option to operate the lamp at an optimum duty cycle and to perform the microwave interrogation for a longer time,\nas described next.\nThe equilibrium temperature of the\nlamp depends on the ambient temperature and the lamp duty cycle. For each\nlamp, it is possible to empirically determine an equilibrium temperature (and,\nhence, a duty cycle) that is optimum in\nthe sense that it maximizes the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) during microwave interrogation. Hence, one of the modifications is to set the bimodal lamp\noperating cycle to the optimum duty\ncycle. The other modification is to increase the microwave-interrogation time\nto a desired integer multiple of the lamp\ncycle time. (The multiple must have an\ninteger value because it is still necessary\nto synchronize the optical and microwave operating cycles.) The size of\nthe integer multiple is subject to an over-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nall limit determined by the quantum-coherence time of the 199Hg+ ions and the\ncharacteristic stability time of the microwave source.\nThe following results have been reported from experiments performed on\na LITS to demonstrate these modifications: The best short-term fractional frequency instability achieved with a typical\n\nmicrowave-interrogation time of 6 s in\nthe unmodified bimodal lamp cycle was\nbetween 7 and 10 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x9314\xcf\x84\xe2\x80\x931/2, where \xcf\x84 is\nthe averaging (observation) time in seconds. The use of the modified lamp\nmode and a microwave-interrogation\ntime of 30 s resulted in a short-term fractional instability of 5 and 10 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x80\x9314\xcf\x84\xe2\x80\x931/2.\nTo put these numbers in perspective, it\n\nwas calculated that the time for the LITS\nto settle to a fractional frequency instability of 10\xe2\x80\x9316 would be about 8.4 days\nwithout the modifications or 2.9 days\nwith the modifications.\nThis work was done by Eric Burt and\nRobert Tjoelker of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nAn apparatus for simulating the environment at the surface of Mars has\nbeen developed. Within the apparatus,\nthe pressure, gas composition, and\ntemperature of the atmosphere; the incident solar visible and ultraviolet\n(UV) light; and the attenuation of the\nlight by dust in the atmosphere can be\nsimulated accurately for any latitude,\nseason, or obliquity cycle over the entire geological history of Mars. The apparatus also incorporates instrumentation for monitoring chemical reactions\nin the simulated atmosphere. The apparatus can be used for experiments in\nastrobiology, geochemistry, aerobiology, and aerochemistry related to envisioned robotic and human exploration\nof Mars. Moreover, the apparatus can\nbe easily adapted to enable similar experimentation under environmental\nconditions of (1) the surfaces of\nmoons, asteroids, and comets, and (2)\nthe upper atmospheres of planets\nother than Mars: in particular, it can be\nmade to simulate conditions anywhere\nin the terrestrial atmosphere at altitudes up to about 100 km.\nThe apparatus (see figure) includes a\ncylindrical stainless-steel chamber,\nwherein the simulated atmospheric pressure is maintained between set points by\nmeans of a vacuum pump and a throttle\nvalve controlled by an electronic pressure controller. The pressure can be set\nat any level from ambient down to 0.1\nmb (100 Pa).

The algorithm is used to find images of the Sun in cameras aboard the\nMars Exploration Rovers. (The images\nare used in estimating orientations of the\nRovers relative to the direction to the\nSun.) The algorithm can also be adapted\nto tracking of circular shaped bright targets in other diverse applications.\nThe first step in the algorithm is to\ncalculate a dark-current ramp \xe2\x80\x94 a correction necessitated by the scheme that\ngoverns the readout of pixel charges in\nthe charge-coupled-device camera in\nthe original Mars Exploration Rover application. In this scheme, the fraction\nof each frame period during which\ndark current is accumulated in a given\npixel (and, hence, the dark-current\ncontribution to the pixel image-intensity reading) is proportional to the\npixel row number. For the purpose of\nthe algorithm, the dark-current contribution to the intensity reading from\neach pixel is assumed to equal the average of intensity readings from all pixels\nin the same row, and the factor of proportionality is estimated on the basis of\nthis assumption. Then the product of\nthe row number and the factor of proportionality is subtracted from the read-\n\ning from each pixel to obtain a darkcurrent-corrected intensity reading.\nThe next step in the algorithm is to\ndetermine the best location, within the\noverall image, for a window of N \xc3\x97N pixels (where N is an odd number) large\nenough to contain the bright spot of interest plus a small margin. (In the original application, the overall image contains 1,024 by 1,024 pixels, the image of\nthe Sun is about 22 pixels in diameter,\nand N is chosen to be 29.)\nThe window is placed at a given position within the overall image. A\nweighted average of the intensities of\nthe 4N \xe2\x80\x93 4 outer pixels of the window is\ntaken as an estimate of background intensity and subtracted from a weighted\naverage of the intensities of the remaining inner (N \xe2\x80\x93 2) \xc3\x97 (N \xe2\x80\x93 2) pixels of the\nwindow to obtain a background-corrected weighted sum of pixel intensities\nfor the window. The weighted averages\nare simply pixel-intensity averages multiplied by common denominators so as\nto obviate floating-point arithmetic operations and thereby accelerate computations. The window is then moved to\nan adjacent column position, and\nweighted averages for the new position\nare calculated from the previous\nweighted averages by adding the appropriate values for the new outer and\ninner pixels and subtracting the corre-\n\nsponding values for the pixels that have\nbeen left behind or changed in status\nbetween the inner and the outer. This\nprocess is repeated until the computations have been performed for all possible window positions. The position that\nyields the highest background-corrected weighted sum of pixel intensities\nis assumed to contain the bright spot of\ninterest (the image of the Sun in the\noriginal application), and the window is\nthen used to locate the bright spot\nmore precisely as described next.\nWithin the inner (N \xe2\x80\x93 2) \xc3\x97 (N \xe2\x80\x93 2) portion of the window, the position of the\nbright spot is determined by means of a\nsimple centroid calculation, using the\nbackground-corrected pixel intensities.\nBecause the window position selected as\ndescribed above may not necessarily be\nthe optimum one, the centroid calculation is performed twice in an iterative\nprocess: For the second centroid calculation, the window is re-centered on the\ncentroid determined by the first centroid calculation.\nThis work was done by Carl Christian\nLiebe of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.

The name of this\nversion reflects its origin in the work of\nthe Maestro team at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory that develops software\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nfor Mars exploration missions.\nExtreme programming is oriented toward agile development of software resting on values of simplicity, communication, testing, and aggressiveness.\nExtreme programming involves use of\nmethods of rapidly building and disseminating institutional knowledge among\nmembers of a computer-programming\nteam to give all the members a shared\n\nview that matches the view of the customers for whom the software system is\nto be developed. Extreme programming\nincludes frequent planning by programmers in collaboration with customers,\ncontinually examining and rewriting\ncode in striving for the simplest workable software designs, a system\nmetaphor (basically, an abstraction of\nthe system that provides easy-to-remem-\n\n29\n\nber software-naming conventions and\ninsight into the architecture of the system), programmers working in pairs,\nadherence to a set of coding standards,\ncollaboration of customers and programmers, frequent verbal communication, frequent releases of software in\nsmall increments of development, repeated testing of the developmental\nsoftware by both programmers and customers, and continuous interaction between the team and the customers.\nThe environment in which the Maestro team works requires the team to\nquickly adapt to changing needs of its\ncustomers. In addition, the team cannot\nafford to accept unnecessary development risk. Extreme programming enables the Maestro team to remain agile\nand provide high-quality software and\nservice to its customers. However, several\nfactors in the Maestro environment have\n\nmade it necessary to modify some of the\nconventional extreme-programming\npractices. The single most influential of\nthese factors is that continuous interaction between customers and programmers is not feasible. The major resulting\ndifferences between the Maestro and\nconventional versions of extreme programming are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Because customers are not always available for planning sessions, members of\nthe team act on behalf of customers\nduring these sessions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In an elaboration of the frequent-planning and incremental-release concept,\nreleases and planning meetings are synchronized with a fixed one-week iteration cycle that facilitates maintenance\nof focus on the development task.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Metaphors are occasionally used as\nneeded in specific instances, but the\nconventional extreme-programming\n\nconcept of a system metaphor is abandoned as not being helpful.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In a departure from the simplest-design rule, the team sometimes develops software infrastructure that affords\ncapabilities, beyond those required in\nthe current iteration, that may be useful later in the development process.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the absence of continuous involvement of customers and of frequent\ntesting of software by customers, there\nis heavy reliance on automated testing.\nThis work was done by Jeffrey Norris, Jason\nFox, Kenneth Rabe, I-Hsiang Shu, and Mark\nPowell of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

SMART is\nintended to enable the robot to recognize adverse terrain conditions beyond\nits optimal operational envelope, and, in\nresponse, to intelligently reconfigure itself (e.g., adjust suspension heights or\nbaseline distances between suspension\npoints) or adapt its driving techniques\n(e.g., engage in a crabbing motion as a\nswitchback technique for ascending\nsteep terrain). Conceived for original application aboard Mars rovers and similar\nautonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robots used in exploration of remote\nplanets, SMART could also be applied to\nautonomous terrestrial vehicles to be\nused for search, rescue, and/or exploration on rough terrain.\nIn SMART, controlling the motion of\nthe robot, managing the \xe2\x80\x9chealth\xe2\x80\x9d of the\nrobot, and managing resources are considered as parts of a free-flow behavior\nhierarchy that autonomously adapts to\nchanging conditions. Tasks that must be\nperformed in the continuing development of SMART are to provide for safe,\nadaptive mobility on highly sloped ter-\n\n30\n\nrain include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determination of strategies for adaptive reconfiguration and driving that\nare nearly optimal with respect to\nsafety and are computationally feasible\nfor on-board implementation,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determination of a representation for\nuncertainty in sensing and prediction\nof the state of the robot and its environment, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determination of resource-management strategies that mitigate such risks\nas those of the loss of battery power\nand/or drive motors.\nSMART is based largely on a prior architecture denoted Biologically Inspired\nSystem for Map-based Autonomous\nRover Control (BISMARC), which, in\nturn is based on a modified free-flow hierarchy. BISMARC has been used with\nsuccess in a number of different simulated mission scenarios, wherein it has\nbeen demonstrated to afford capabilities\nfor retrieving objects cached at multiple\nlocations, fault tolerance on missions of\nlong duration, and preparing terrain\nsites for habitation by humans. BISMARC includes provisions for all aspects\nof safety, self-maintenance, and achievement of goals, as needed to support a\nsustained presence on the surface of a remote planet.\nBISMARC is organized as a two-level\n\nsystem. From stereoscopic images acquired by cameras aboard the robot, the\nfirst level generates hypotheses of motor\nactions. The second level processes these\nhypotheses, coupled with external and\ninternal inputs, to generate control signals to drive the actuators on the robot.\nThe figure illustrates the free-flow action-selection hierarchy of BISMARC and\nSMART. The rectangular boxes represent\nbehaviors, while the ovals represent sensory inputs (either fixed, direct, or derived). At the top are the high-level behaviors, including Don\xe2\x80\x99t Tip Over, Go to\nGoal, Avoid Obstacles, Preserve Motors,\nWarm Up, Get Power, and Sleep at Night.\nThe\nintermediate-level\nbehaviors\n(Change Center of Gravity, Avoid Obstacles, Rest, and Sleep) are designed to interact with both the short-term memory\n(which corresponds to perceived sensory\nstimuli), and the long-term memory\n(which encodes remembered sensory information). Control loops are prevented\nby use of temporal penalties, which constrain the system to repeat a given behavior no more than a predetermined number of times. The bottom-level behaviors\n(Tilt Arm, Change Shoulder Angles,\nMove, Rest, Stop, Sleep) fuse the sensory\ninputs and the activations of the higherlevel behaviors in order to select appropriate actions for safety and achieving goals.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\nPerceived\nTilt\n2.0\n\nInterior\nTemperature\nDistance\nto Goal\n\n1.0\n3.0\n\nDon't Tip\nOver\n\nGo to\nGoal\n\nChange\nCenter of\nGravity\n\nPreserve\nMotors\n\n1.5\n\nExterior\nTemperature\n\nProximity\nto Night\n\nPower\n\n4.0\n\n0.20\nWarm Up\n\nGet Power\n\nSleep at Night\n\nTOP LEVEL\n\nSleep\n\nINTERMEDIATE\nLEVEL\n\nSleep\n\nBOTTOM LEVEL\n\n\xe2\x80\x930.35\nAvoid\nObstacles\n\nRemembered\nObstacle\nPerceived\nHeading\n\nChange\nShoulder\nAngle\n\nTerrain\n\nRest\n\nPerceived\nGoal\n\n\xe2\x80\x931.0\n\nRemembered\nGoal\n\nTilt Arm\n\n0.80\n\nTemporal\nPenalty\n\nShoulder\nAngle\n\nArm\nAngle\n\nAvoid\nObstacles\n\nCurrent\nDraw\n3.0\n\nGoal\nPresent\n\nPerceived\nObstacle\n\nN\n\nN\nE\n\nE\n\n\xe2\x80\x931.0\nS S S W N\nE\nW\nW\nMove\n\n5.0\nRest\n\nStop\n\nThe Free-Flow Action-Selection Hierarchy includes multiple behaviors at different levels. The numerical values shown at several places are examples of\nweights assigned to inputs of behavioral modes. In general, such weights are changed as needed to adapt to changing or previously unknown environmental conditions.\n\nInputs to the behavioral nodes are\ncalculated as weighted sums. In BISMARC, the weights are fixed; consequently, BISMARC is not capable of\nadaptation to changing conditions or\nto environments outside an original\nworld model. In contrast, SMART includes a learning mechanism that\n\nadapts the weights to changing and\npreviously unanticipated conditions:\nAn algorithm, known in the art as the\nmaximize collective happiness (MCH)\nalgorithm, adjusts the weights in such a\nmanner as to maintain the health of\nthe robot while ensuring progress toward the goal.\n\nThis work was done by Terrance Huntsberger of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.

In order to support\nprecise formation flying, it would be\nnecessary to establish a corresponding\ncommunication network, through which\nthe vehicles could exchange position\nand orientation data and formation-con-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\ntrol commands. The communication\nnetwork must enable communication\nduring early phases of a mission, when\nlittle positional knowledge is available.\nParticularly during early mission phases,\nthe distances among vehicles may be so\nlarge that communication could be\nachieved only by relaying across multiple\nlinks. The large distances and need for\nomnidirectional coverage would limit\ncommunication links to operation at low\nbandwidth during these mission phases.\nOnce the vehicles were in formation and\ndistances were shorter, the communication network would be required to provide high-bandwidth, low-jitter service to\nsupport tight formation-control loops.\nThe proposed protocol and architecture, intended to satisfy the aforementioned and other requirements, are based\non a standard layered-reference-model\nconcept. The proposed application proto-\n\ncol would be used in conjunction with\nconventional network, data-link, and\nphysical-layer protocols. The proposed\nprotocol includes the ubiquitous Institute\nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n(IEEE) 802.11 medium access control\n(MAC) protocol to be used in the datalink layer. In addition to its widespread\nand proven use in diverse local-area networks, this protocol offers both (1) a random-access mode needed for the early\nPFF deployment phase and (2) a timebounded-services mode needed during\nPFF-maintenance operations. Switching\nbetween these two modes could be controlled by upper-layer entities using standard link-management mechanisms.\nBecause the early deployment phase of\na PFF mission can be expected to involve\nmultihop relaying to achieve network\nconnectivity (see figure), the proposed\nprotocol includes the open shortest path\n\n31\n\nLeader\nSubnetwork\nLeaderless\nSubnetwork\n\nIsolated Nodes and Subnetworks\n\nTime\n\nfirst (OSPF) network protocol that is\ncommonly used in the Internet. Each\nspacecraft in a PFF network would be in\none of seven distinct states as the mission\nevolved from initial deployment,\nthrough coarse formation, and into precise formation. Reconfiguration of the\nformation to perform different scientific\nobservations would also cause state\nchanges among the network nodes. The\napplication protocol provides for recognition and tracking of the seven states for\neach node and for protocol changes\nunder specified conditions to adapt the\nnetwork and satisfy communication requirements associated with the current\nPFF mission phase. Except during early\ndeployment, when peer-to-peer randomaccess discovery methods would be used,\nthe application protocol provides for operation in a centralized manner.\nThe central communication node,\ndenoted the \xe2\x80\x9cleader\xe2\x80\x9d spacecraft, would\nbe selected so that its position in the\nformation tended to be spatially in the\ncenter. For example, PFF interferometry missions are typically configured\nwith a single \xe2\x80\x9ccombiner\xe2\x80\x9d that is centrally located relative to the other\nspacecraft. Selection of the spatially\ncentral node as the central communication node would leverage the special\ncharacteristics of the PFF networking\nproblem domain in order to achieve\nhigh communication efficiency. In particular, when the spacecraft had positioned themselves into coarse formation, the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol\ncould be adapted from \xe2\x80\x9cdistributed coordination function\xe2\x80\x9d (DCF) mode (a\npeer-to-peer random-access mode) to\n\xe2\x80\x9cpoint coordination function\xe2\x80\x9d (PCF)\nmode, in which the leader would act as\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cpoint coordinator\xe2\x80\x9d, so that timebounded services needed to support\ntime-critical control could be activated.\n\nAll Nodes Connected in a Single Multihop Network\n\nStar Network\n\nA Communication Network would evolve as spatially dispersed nodes moved into a coarse formation\nand then into a tightly controlled precise formation. The proposed protocol would enable communication among the nodes at all phases of evolution of the network.\n\nFurthermore, if antenna patterns were\nbiased to afford higher gain when the\nspacecraft were in coarse formation,\nthe protocol could recognize these\nconditions and cause higher data rates\nto be used in communications. It\nshould be noted that in conventional\napplications of the IEEE 802.11 MAC\nprotocol in \xe2\x80\x9cad hoc\xe2\x80\x9d networks, such a\npriori knowledge of antenna gain patterns and other features of network\n\nspatial configurations cannot be assumed and utilized. The predictability\nof the spacecraft formation would\nmake it possible to utilize them in the\nproposed protocol.\nThis work was done by Esther Jennings,\nClayton Okino, Jay Gao, and Loren Clare of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The method was originally intended to be used in scheduling large\ncampaigns of scientific observations by\ninstruments aboard a spacecraft. A typical\nsuch campaign could include observations of millions of targets, many observations to be made during long repeated\npasses. The method would also be useful\n\non Earth for scheduling complex sequences of activities that include cycles.\nThe method is best summarized in the\ncontext of the original intended application, wherein the scheduling problem is\nformulated as that of selecting, from a\ncandidate set of observations, those observations that cover as many target\npoints as possible without oversubscrib-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\ning energy and memory budgets. Inasmuch as observation opportunities repeat, the theoretical framework for evaluation of candidate solutions includes a\ncycle bound.\nThe method includes the use of an iterative optimization algorithm known in\nthe art the \xe2\x80\x9csqueaky wheel optimization.\xe2\x80\x9d This algorithm consists of the following steps:\n1. Sort all of the target points according\nto priority.\n2. Schedule each target point, greedily,\nin order of priority.\n3. Increase priorities for those points\nthat were omitted from the schedule\nin step 2.\n4. Iterate by repeating from step 1.\nThus, points that are not initially scheduled have a greater probability of being\nscheduled on subsequent iterations because each time a point is not scheduled,\n\nits priority is increased, until eventually it\nbecomes the first point scheduled.\nAt each iteration, points are considered in order of priority and observations considered in descending order\nof the contribution of each to coverage\nuntil a minimum acceptable level of\ncoverage of each affected point has\nbeen scheduled. Only observations that\ncannot oversubscribe memory or energy and that respect transition duration constraints are considered. The asymptotic time complexity (in effect, the\ntime needed to perform the computations) is of the order of a number proportional to nlog(n) per iteration,\nwhere n is the number of points. This\ncomputation time is basically proportional to the time needed to sort the\npoints according to priority.\nFor reasoning about multiple cycles,\nmultiple cycles are used in representing\n\nenergy and memory, but a single cycle is\nused in representing observations. The\nsingle-cycle representation can be characterized as compressed in that, relative\nto a time-line representation, it requires\nless memory to represent all possible observations over all cycles. Instead of listing all observations individually, one lists\na single cycle of observations with labels\nthat represent which observations belong to which cycles. The amount of\nmemory needed to encode observations\nin this approach is proportional to the\ntotal number of observations.\nThis work was done by Steve Chien and\nRussell Knight of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.

This results in a\nsystem that handles the terrain well that\nit trained in, but is unable to process terrain outside its test parameters.\nAn adaptive system does not take the\nplace of training, but supplements it.\nWhereas training imprints certain environments, an adaptive system would imprint terrain elements and the interac-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2009\n\ntions amongst them, and allow the vehicle to build a map of local elements using\nproprioceptive sensors.
