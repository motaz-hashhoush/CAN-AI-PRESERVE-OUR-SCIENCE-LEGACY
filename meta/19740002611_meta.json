A review of the total design problem is presented, and design elements are identified which are involved in successful design. Current technology pertaining to these elements is also described. Design criteria are presented which state what rule or standard must be imposed on each essential design element to assure successful design. These criteria serve as a checklist of rules for a project manager to use in guiding a design or in assessing its adequacy. Recommended practices are included which state how to satisfy each of the criteria.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740002611, "id": "8370643be6b04c8495ec99b062cf5963", "publicationDate": "1973-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740002611.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740002611/downloads/19740002611.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740002611/downloads/19740002611.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740002611/downloads/19740002611.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
