Planetary investigations and solar discoveries are providing new insights into\nthe origin and evolution of the Earth\nand the dynamics of the solar system.\nThe knowledge amassed through\nthese expeditions has justified this\nNation\'s commitment to probe the\nmysteries of space and has encouraged us to lift our eyes beyond our\noriginal goals.\nThe fruits of our national investment\nin space and aeronautics have stimulated the invention and manufacture\nof a host of new products and services\nfor virtually every segment of society.\nThese technical advances are being\nused to inventory crop yields and\nnatural resources, to protect and improve the environment, to provide\nbetter health and medical care, to expand worldwide communications and\nweather forecasting, and to spur the\ndevelopment of safer, cleaner and\nmore economical transportation\nsystems.\nMost important, our exploration of\nouter space has added another dimension to our outlook and made us more\neffective explorers of peace on Earth\nand goodwill among its peoples.\nAll Americans should be proud of\nwhat the space program has accomplished in the past\xe2\x80\x94and excited by the\nprospect of future achievement and\ndiscovery.\n\nPresident Ford holds container enclosing small segment of a unique crystal\nthat was manufactured in space by one\nof the Skylab crews. Segment was\npresented by Dr. James C. Fletcher,\n(left), NASA Administrator.\n\nAdministrator\'s Message\nThe mid-70\'s have arrived. And so has\nspace. It is a good time to examine the\npath we have been travelling. It is a\ngood time to assess NASA accomplishments and estimate the contributions of our research and our space\nexploration to the future of man.\nWe have, as never before, extended\nour powers of scientific observation\nand operation in space. The manned\nSkylab missions concluded early in\n1974 with an 84-day flight that proved\nthe utility of man in space. Besides\nqualifying man for long-duration\nspace flight, the Skylab missions\ndramatized the feasibility of using\nlarge, permanent space stations for\nobserving the Sun, the weather, Earth\nresources monitoring, and to produce,\nunder zero gravity, materials that\ncould not be duplicated on Earth.\nWith the unmanned spacecraft\ncalled Pioneer and Mariner, we completed incredibly long journeys to\nthree planets\xe2\x80\x94Venus, Mercury and\nJupiter. We have reached out further\nand gained a better understanding of\nthe Solar System. In so doing, we discover strong relationships between\nthe processes which govern the evolution of these planets and the Earth.\nBy looking out into the Universe, we\nunderstand our Earth a little better.\nWe also strengthen our conviction\nthat continued exploration of the Universe is necessary sustenance of the\nhuman spirit.\nWhile scientists were finding great\nrelevance and new information from\nthe planetary missions, other spacecraft were developed and launched to\nserve man\'s direct and immediate\nneeds. A very powerful communications satellite, Applications Technol-\n\nogy Satellite-6, demonstrated that educational and medical consultation\nprograms could be transmitted via\nlow-cost receivers to overcome isolation and bring the most advanced\nservices to persons in remote places.\nSatellites launched by NASA have\nshown how reliable and productive\nspace sentinels can be in reporting on\nweather and Earth resources. Space\ntechnology has provided the means\nfor warning against the great weather\nforces which destroy life and property. Commercial use of domestic\ncommunications satellites has arrived.\nThe recent months illustrate the\nextent to which space activities have\nmatured and come of age. Emphasis\nshifts more and more to applying\nspace technology to serve human\nneeds. The same holds true for NASA\naeronautical research.\nThe years spent in developing a\nspace and aeronautical research\ncapability have provided NASA with a\nbasis for contributing importantly to\nthe solution of some of the nation\'s\nmost pressing problems. Nowhere is\nthis attribute more evident than in the\nfield of aeronautics, where NASA\'s\ntraditions of service (with its predecessor agency) go back 60 years.\nIncreasingly crowded air lanes, jet\nengine noise, steadily rising aviation\ncosts, growing concern over fuel\nshortages and stronger foreign aircraft competition are some of the\nchallenges that NASA programs are\ndesigned to meet. America\'s international leadership in developing civil\nand military aircraft has paid off\nhandsomely on the plus side of the\nbalance-of-payments ledger and in\nproviding domestic employment. To\n\nlose this pre-eminence would place\nan intolerable burden on the nation\'s\neconomy to say nothing of our air\ndefense capabilities.\nWhile much of NASA\'s total effort\nis helping to maintain and enhance\nU.S. world leadership in aviation, no\nopportunity is lost to focus technology\non the solution, or easing, of such\nproblems as airport neighborhood\nnoise levels, objectionable engine\nemissions, air traffic congestion, flight\nsafety, and fuel-conserving systems\nand techniques. The combined application of all the technologies that\nNASA is working on could lead to\ngreatly improved efficiency of aircraft\non operations, resulting in very significant savings of fossil fuel during\nthe next 10 to 15 years.\nIn many fields\xe2\x80\x94medicine, business,\nindustry, education\xe2\x80\x94space technology and aeronautical technology have\nprovided new devices, processes,\nproducts and information of benefit to\nman. The flow and transfer of this\ntechnology is not incidental or accidental. It is the product of a conscious, determined effort to wring the\nmost benefit for all out of every dollar\nspent on NASA research.\nWe are confident that NASA\'s\nachievements have established space\nexploration as a keystone in humanity\'s continued quest for new knowledge and better life on this planet.\n\nDividends from Space\n\nIt is somewhat of a paradox that the\ngreatest discovery of the Space Age\nis the planet Earth. By moving out into\nspace we have been able to view our\nworld from a new perspective. We\nhave seen its oneness and its beauty,\nits fragility and its limitations. And we\nare alarmed. For this blue oasis in\nthe void which supports our human\nexistence is indeed finite and incapable of sustaining indefinitely twentieth-century man\'s voracious\nappetite.\nFortunately, the technology that has\nopened our eyes and minds to the\nrealities of the future also has given\nus the tools to meet the awesome\nchallenges that lie ahead. Today, we\nare demonstrating that space technology and systems can be used\neffectively not only to preserve and\nmanage Earth\'s precious resources\nand environment and to exploit its\nhidden riches, but also to enhance the\nquality of life for all its inhabitants.\nThe National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration continues to move\naggressively towards these goals.\nApplications satellites launched by\nNASA have demonstrated an unmatched capability in crop surveillance, land-use surveys, weather\nforecasting, education, communications, pollution monitoring, navigation\nand the search for new mineral and\nenergy sources.\nThe Land\nNo satellite has stirred more excitement than a natural resources satellite called LANDSAT-1. Historians of\nthe future may compare its development with that of the wheel or fire, so\n\nFrom the Skylab space station in Earth\norbit, Earth resources photo traces\nthe flow of the Mobile River and its sedi ment-laden currents into Mobile Bay.\n\n$\'\n\n*\n5S\n;\n\n, \xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\niW\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\' \'\n\n>;.^\n\ntern\n5\xc2\xab^\n\nFor the first time a giant photo map of\nthe contiguous 48 states could be\npieced together with 595 cloud-free\nblack and white pictures taken by\nNASA\'s LANDSAT 1. The Department\nof Agriculture\'s Soil Conservation\nService assembled the map on a scale\nof 1:1,000,000.\nrevolutionary and so basic may\nbecome its ultimate impact on human\nsociety. Launched nearly three years\nago, LANDSAT-1 has opened whole\nnew fields of Earth studies. Scanning\nthe Earth every 18 days, its sensors\nrecord the unique signatures radiated\nby land, water, minerals, vegetation\nand man-made structures. Using\nthese signatures, scientists have\nachieved some dramatic applications.\nLANDSAT\'s imagery has provided\nthe raw data to haul polluters of air\nand water into court. It has led\ngeologists on oil and mineral hunts in\nAlaska, Oklahoma, the Rocky Mountains and the jungles of Brazil.\nBiologists have been able to predict\npotential fishing grounds. Changes in\necology brought on by forest fires,\nearthquakes and strip mining have\nbeen plotted. Municipalities guide\nurban development by determining in\nadvance how projected growth patterns will affect transportation needs,\npublic service facilities and the environment. LANDSAT alerted the\nhardpressed nations of Africa\'s\ndrought-stricken Sahel region to the\npossibility of reclaiming desert areas\nfor productive use through controlled\ngrazing.\nLANDSAT\'s potential for agriculture is staggering. Farmland of an\nentire region can be sorted crop-bycrop in a matter of hours in combination with high-speed computers. The\nend result is a computer-printed\nterrain map showing precise location\nand area of each crop type by symbolC (corn), S (soybean), W (wheat), etc.\nAt the November 1974 World Food\nConference in Rome, Secretary of\nState Henry A. Kissinger stressed\nGeologists readily outlined the contours\nof the San Andreas Fault and other\nfeatures in California on this LANDSAT\n1 picture.\n\nHealthy crops are bright red, suburban\nareas light pink, and barren land light\ngray in a composite photo of Cyprus\nfrom LANDSAT 1. NASA\'s Goddard\nSpace Flight Center put it together\nwith green, red, and infrared pictures\nmade by the satellite from 568 miles\nabove.\nsatellite surveillance techniques of\nthe kind pioneered by LANDSAT-1 as\nan important tool for improving food\ndistribution and the nutritional standards of the world\'s hungry millions.\nThe first step in this direction began\nin January 1975 with the launch\nof LANDSAT-2, which has been\nassigned a key role in America\'s\nambitious Large Area Crop Inventory\nExperiment. The project combines\nLANDSAT imagery with meteorological data from weather satellites and\nground stations to establish and\nrefine procedures for predicting major\ncrop yields. If successful, the project\ncould evolve into follow-on programs\nof enormous benefit to producers and\nconsumers alike. By pinpointing areas\nof food shortages and surpluses far\nenough ahead, inequities in supply\nand demand might be smoothed out,\nsoaring food costs curtailed and\nhunger alleviated as a global problem.\nCommunications\nIt\'s hard to remember a time before\nintercontinental television and the\nubiquitous words "via satellite"\ncommonly appeared on news programs. It was just 10 years ago.\nThe first one-hour television program linking Europe and America cost\n$22,350. The cost is now $5,120. The\nmonthly charge for a telephone circuit\nbetween New York and Europe fell\nfrom $10,000 to $4,625 during the\nsame span.\nSatellites overcome the problems\nand limitations of submarine cables,\nland lines and ground radio stations.\nUnlike Earth-bound communications\nsystems that operate between two\n\nTo check up on LANDSAT 1 \'s ability\nto find oil, the satellite\'s cameras were\naimed at the Anadarko Basin (below),\nan area in Western Oklahoma throughly\nknown to geologists. The LANDSAT\ntask was to find hydrocarbons trapped\n900 to 3,000 feet deep. Its picture\n\n(bottom) shows so-called "hazy"\nareas not recognizable in ordinary\naerial photos. Of 35 such areas, some\nof which are outlined here, 33 corresponded to producing oil fields or\ndrilled structures.\n\npoints only, satellites connect all\nstations in the area they cover. The\nlargest oceanic cable, for instance,\ncan carry a maximum of 1,840 conversations, and no television. Communications satellites, on the other hand,\nhave a capacity of more than 3,000\nsimultaneous telephone circuits, and\ncan carry color television as well.\nWhen placed in synchronous or\nstationary orbits above the Atlantic,\nPacific and Indian Oceans, a set of\nthree satellites can reach every point\non the globe, making the dream of\nreliable worldwide communications a\nreality. A stationary orbit has the\nsatellite, at 35,680 kilometers (22,300\nmiles) altitude, matching the Earth\'s\nrotation so that it hovers over one\nspot on the Equator.\nRecent years have seen significant\nadvances in satellite communications.\nThe sixth in a series of eight planned\nINTELSAT IV global communications\n\nspacecraft was launched by NASA\nin 1974 on a cost-recoverable basis\nfor the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, which\nnumbers about 90 member nations\naround the world.\nThe INTELSAT spacecraft are the\nworld\'s first and largest international\ncommunications carriers. Their cultural and economic impact on society\nis unquestionable. News and social\nevents are carried to hundreds of\nmillions of people around the world\nas they happen, pushing back the\nbarriers of misunderstanding, distrust\nand ignorance. INTELSATs for example, brought the world the stirring\nmoment when Neil Armstrong took\nman\'s first step on the Moon, and\nallowed the world to follow former\nPresident Nixon\'s momentous state\nvisit to China. They also gave the\nworld a ring-side seat at the 1972\nOlympic Games, lastyear\'s World\nCup Soccer matches and the AllForeman heavyweight championship\nfight.\nThe world\'s first domestic commercial communications satellites\xe2\x80\x94\nWestars 1 and 2\xe2\x80\x94were launched by\nNASA for the Western Union Company. (The company reimbursed\nNASA for the cost of the launches.)\nEach Westar can provide thousands\nof commercial telephone and telegraph links as well as several color\ntelevision links between New York,\nChicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and\nAtlanta.\nSince July 1974, NASA\'s Applications Technology Satellite-6, the\nmost complex, versatile and powerful\ncommunications satellite ever developed, has brought education and\n\nThe ravages of strip mining can be\nmonitored through the camera eyes of\nLANDSAT 1 almost as plainly as in the\naerial photograph (top right) of a\nKentucky region.

S. equipped with low-cost ground\nstations.\nFrom its stationary orbit above the\nEquator, ATS has beamed special\nremedial reading courses to teachers\nin sparsely populated areas of\nAppalachia.\nIn the Rocky Mountain region, 56\nrural schools in eight states received\na variety of classroom programs and\ncareer guidance courses. Nearly\n5,000 students and hundreds of\nteachers, administrators and counselors were involved. Half the receiving sites are equipped with low-cost,\n\n1\n\nTest model of Applications\nTechnology Satellite.\n\n10\n\nPhoto from synchronous weather satellite shows most of continental U. S. and\npart of South America.\n\ntwo-way communications facilities,\nmaking possible live participation in\nseminars from such out-of-the-way\nplaces as Cuba, N.M., Blanding, Utah,\nand Riverton, Wyo. Community education programs ranging from\nalcoholism to old age and health care\nare also offered.\nIn Alaska, 18 communities in remote areas with no previous TV reception of any kind took part in\ntwo-way classroom instruction sessions via Applications Technology\nSatellite 6. In addition, the system was\nused for telemedicine experiments.\nDoctors in remote outposts consulted\ndirectly with top specialists, transmitting patients\' records and X-rays\nand actually examining the patients\nbefore television cameras in live, twoway voice and picture transmissions.\nThe satellite\'s capability was emphasized dramatically in January 1975\nwhen a doctor in Seattle, Washington\nused two-way television contact via\nthe satellite to instruct a nurse in\nAlaska\'s northern wilds as she performed surgery to save the life of a\nbadly injured Eskimo.\nTen Veterans Administration hospitals in the continental states used\nApplications Technology Satellite-6\nto provide live, interhospital exchanges of medical data, patient case\nstudies and inservice training\nseminars for doctors and medical\npersonnel.\nWith the repositioning of Applications Technology Satellite-6, in\nmid-1975, over Lake Victoria in East\nAfrica it was available as a major\ncommunications link for the joint\nU.S.-U.S.S.R. manned space mission\nand for later use by the Government\n\nof India in broadcasting subjects\nranging from basic literacy to agriculture, family planning and hygiene.\nThe Atmosphere\nNo tool save the computer has\nadvanced the science of weather\nforecasting as rapidly as the satellite.\nTwo in particular, Nimbus and the\nSynchronous Meteorological Satellite, have added a new dimension to\nmeteorology.\nNimbus, circling the Earth in polar\norbit at an altitude of 1,120 kilometers\n(700 miles), records temperatures and\nmaps weather formations over the\nentire globe twice a day. Its microwave sensors look right through any\nclouds to map and track ice flows and\nicebergs in the arctic and antarctic.\nThe Navy has described the mapping\nof ice movements by Nimbus as an\n"indispensable service to the safe\noperation of world shipping lanes."\nNimbus also maps both the Gulf\nStream and Humboldt Currents daily\nto determine the dramatic weather\neffects they propagate hundreds of\nmiles inland.\nNimbus also has the unique ability\nto monitor rainfall amounts, which\nis providing a new insight into global\nrainfall patterns that may eventually\ngive scientists the means to predict\ndroughts, floods and other weather\nphenomena that play havoc with\nworld food supplies.\nSynchronous Meteorological Satellites\xe2\x80\x94there are two of them in\nstationary orbits, above Brazil and\nthe eastern Pacific\xe2\x80\x94monitor weather\nin the United States every 30 minutes,\nday or night. Infrared sensors, with\n\n12\n\nthe capability to "see" in darkness as\nwell as daylight, tracked Hurricanes\nCarmen and Fifi continuously from\nbirth to death in 1974, providing the\nfirst full-time surveillance of a monster tropical storm. As a result, lives\nand property were saved through\nadequate warnings. In addition scientists were able to learn more about\nthe formation and erratic behavior of\nthese tropical tempests which plague\nthe North American continent.\nTornado development comes under\nthe watch of satellites as well.\nSuspicious weather formations that\nmight spawn destructive tornadoes\ncan be scanned at five-minute intervals, allowing for earlier warnings of\nthese killer winds. The satellites also\nperform as space data collection\ncenters, relaying to ground centers\ninformation on tides, river currents,\nwind velocities and rainfall amounts\ncollected automatically from hundreds of unmanned stations and\nocean bouys on the surface below.\nThe ability to make direct and\nindirect observations of weather\nphenomena from the ground and from\nspace has given meteorologists the\ncapability to extend the accuracy and\nlength of weather forecasting to a\ndegree never before possible.\nThe Oceans\nAs the ocean lanes become more\ncrowded and the vessels larger, the\nneed for adequate communications\nand information on sea conditions\nbecome more acute. Here, too, applications satellites will have a key role,\nwith NASA launching maritime\ncommercial communications satel-\n\nlites called Marisats.\nFrom vantage points over the\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans, the\nMarisats will provide the first continuous, real-time communications\nnetwork for ships at sea. The system,\nwhich carries voice, teletype, facsimile and high-speed data transmissions, will have a quality and\nreliability far exceeding current\nmethods of ship-to-ship and ship-toshore communications.\nLater in the decade, a series of\nexperimental oceanographic satellites known as Seasats will provide\ncontinuous monitoring of ocean\nconditions, keeping watch on storms,\ncurrents, ice fields and weather\nconditions. They also will accumulate\ninformation on the curvature of the\noceans; ocean circulations; the transport of mass, heat and nutrients by\nsurface currents; and interactions\nbetween air and water.\nAn operational network of Seasats\ncould provide individual ships at sea\nwith twice-daily maps of theirspecific\nroutes, showing weather conditions\nand hazards. In time, Seasat data\ncould influence ship design, port\ndevelopment and the selection of\nsites for such off-shore facilities as\npower plants.\nApplications satellites give man\nthe ability to observe and measure on\na global basis the phenomena that\naffects his everyday life\xe2\x80\x94rapidly,\naccurately and economically. They\nare perhaps the most important\nproduct of the space age, forthey\nsee no political divisions or geographic boundaries, and serve only\nto improve the quality and security of\nlife for everyone.\n\nTechnology arrived at by exploring\nspace is being applied in the factory,\non the road, and in the hospitals. The\nyoung leukemia patient (1) is being\nbundled into a biological isolation\ngarment derived from the astronaut\'s\nspace suit to protect her while outside\nthe sterile treatment room. Patients as\n\nold as Mrs. Helen Chambers, 76 (2),\nand as young as Jeni Guarascio, 3, who\nappeared with NASA executives before\nthe House Committee on Science and\nAstronautics (3), benefit from the\nrechargeable heart pacemaker (4).\nAt the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (5)\nengineers Harry Cotrill (left) and Jack\n\nRupe test a new anti-pollution fuel of\ngasoline, hydrogen, and air in an auto\nengine. Out of NASA\'s study of propellants under zero gravity came the prototype of a ferrofluid machine (6), which\ncan separate nonferrous metals, such\nas zinc, copper, and aluminum, from\nautomobile scrap.\n\nThe Planets\n\nWe study the planets to learn more\nabout the origin and evolution of the\nsolar system of which Earth is a part.\nSince the planets are in various\nstages of evolution, they function as\ngalactic "time machines", allowing\nus to see where we have been and\nwhere we are going.\nWe study the planets to answer\nman\'s oldest and most intriguing\nquestion: Are we alone in the\nuniverse? The discovery of life of any\nkind elsewhere in the solar system\nwould presume the existence of\nintelligent civilizations in other parts\nof the Galaxy.\nWe study the planets because we\ncannot ignore the possibility that time\nand the ravages of man may require\nnew abodes in the heavens for the\npreservation of the human race.\nFinally, we study the planets to\nunlock the secrets of the dynamic\nprocesses at work in the solar system\nand to learn more about the formation\nand development of phenomena that\nbear directly on Earth\'s environment\nand the needs and security of all\nhumanity.\nWhile the benefits derived from\nexploration of the planets must be\nmeasured in decades and cannot be\nevaluated in terms of specific costs,\npotential returns directly applicable\nto man\'s interests on Earth are already beginning to materialize.\nA decade ago, for example, the\nunmanned Mariner 4 spacecraft made\nthe surprising finding that radiation\nplayed an important part in dictating\nthe weather on Mars. In Earth weather\nmodels, radiation had always been\nomitted as being a negligible factor.\nFollowing the Mars\' results, radiation\n\nM\n\neffects were added to analytical\nweather models and substantially\nimproved the accuracy of weather\npredictions on Earth. This application\nof comparative planetology has been\nwell documented by the National\nAcademy of Sciences.\nIt has long been established that\na sustained drop in the average\ntemperature of the Earth\'s atmosphere of only about 4 degrees C (7\ndegrees F) could trigger another disastrous ice age. This has raised the\nquestion of whether smoke, dust and\nother pollutants being pumped into\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere could cause a\nrise or fall in global temperatures by\nblocking heat from the Sun or by preventing radiated heat from escaping\nback out into space. NASA\'s Mariner 9\nspacecraft, which orbited Mars for\nnearly a year back in 1971-72 and\nreturned detailed information about\nthe planet, provided a direct answer.\nBy a stroke of fate, Mariner 9 reached\nMars during the height of a monstrous\ndust storm that had raged for months\nand had completely surrounded the\nplanet. The spacecraft continually\nrecorded temperature profiles of the\nplanet as the thin Martian atmosphere\nwent from a dust-filled condition to a\nclear state. The result? The heavy\nand prolonged concentration of dust\nparticles in the Martian atmosphere\ncaused a drop in surface temperature\nof over 20 degrees C (36 degrees F),\na strong indication that a comparable\ndegree and duration of pollutants in\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere could indeed\nset off another ice age.\nMariner 9 also provided data\ndirectly related to another atmospheric concern on Earth, the long-\n\nterm effects of certain pollutants on\nthe Earth\'s vital, high-altitude ozone\nlayer. Ozone depletion could have\nserious consequences for all life on\nour planet since the layer absorbs\nmost of the Sun\'s dangerous ultraviolet radiation. A decrease in total\nozone protection over an extended\nperiod could increase the incidence\nof skin cancers in fair-complexioned\npersons.\nThe environmental impact of ozone\ndepletion has been highlighted in\nrecent years by studies of high-altitude aircraft operations where jet\nengines exhaust oxides of nitrogen\nand water vapor, both of which were\npreviously thought to be involved in\nozone destruction mechanisms.\nNoting the correlation between the\ndisappearance of ozone in the Martian\natmosphere and the release of water\nvapor from the planet\'s polar caps\nin the summer season, Mariner 9\nconfirmed the high reaction rate of\nwater on ozone. However, Mariner 9\nalso detected ozone replenishment\nmechanisms in the Martian atmosphere that removed water vapor as a\nserious villain. It is now known that\nnitrogen oxides pose the real danger\nto Earth\'s environment. The solution\nto the nitrogen-oxide problem, however, is within reach of advanced\ntechnology.\nMariner 10\'sflyby of the planet\nVenus in 1974 also shed new lighten\nthe Earth\'s weather mechanisms.\nBack in the 1700\'s a British astronomer named Hadley wrote a classic\npaper stating that a solar-driven\ncirculation of air from the equator\ntoward the poles is a driving force\nbehind weather on Earth. Meteorolo-\n\nSometime in 1979, an unmanned\nMariner is to fly by the ringed-planet\nSaturn.\n\n15\n\ngists have widely believed in that\nprinciple, but have never been able\nto confirm it. Even with excellent\nsatellite pictures, the cloud patterns\nin Earth\'s atmosphere are so confused by various storms and cyclonic\npatterns that this overall Hadley-cell\ncirculation concept is completely\nobscured.\nThen came Mariner 10\'s first pictures of the Venus cloud belts. It is\nimpossible to overexaggerate the\nexcitement of leading meteorologists\nwhen the pictures revealed the\nHadley-cell circulation pattern exactly\nas drawn in Hadley\'s classic paper\ntwo centuries ago. Meteorologists\n"knew" this was a main driving force\nbehind Earth\'s weather. Now they\ncould finally show the phenomenon.\nIt has been predicted that the\nMariner 10 photographs will stand\nbeside Dr. Hadley\'s drawings in every\nmeteorology textbook published for\nthe next 100 years.\nThe planet Mercury came under\nman\'s close scrutiny for the first time\nin history during Mariner 10\'s journey\nthrough the inner solar system. Using\nVenus\' gravity as an assist, it entered\na solar orbit that brought it close to\nMercury on three separate occasions.\nIt was the first time that a spacecraft\nfrom Earth had used one planet\'s\ngravity to steer it toward another.\nThe first telecast from MarineMO\nshowed surface details that were\nas small as 300 feet wide and led onlookers at first to think that Mercury,\nwith its highlands and plains, also\nresembled the Moon and Mars. The\nfeatures even suggested a lightweight\ncrust of silicate composition similar\nto the Moon\'s. But Mercury also has a\n\n16\n\nregion of hills and furrows, covering\nhundreds of square miles, that is\nunlike anything on Mars or the Moon.\nMariner 10 also startled scientists by\ndiscovering that Mercury has an\natmosphere. Not much of an atmosphere, to be sure; it amounts to less\nthan a trillionth of that which cloaks\nthe Earth and is composed chiefly\nof helium.\nThe three flybys of Mercury by\nMariner 10 put into question a commonly-held theory about the magnetic\nfields of planets. It has long been\nbelieved that the magnetic fields are\ngenerated by a dynamo-like action\ninvolving liquid interior material, such\nas a molten, iron-rich core, and fairly\nfast rotation rates of the planets.\nHowever, Mariner 10 detected a significant, intrinsic magnetic field on\nMercury and that planet rotates very\nslowly. Perhaps the magnetism is a\nremnant, left over from an earlier\nepoch when Mercury spun fast\nenough to generate such a field. The\nMercury data should encourage new\nand better theories on the generating\nmechanism behind planetary magnetism, which may, in turn, yield new\ninsight into the forces behind earthquakes.\nOf all planetary voyages, few have\nstirred the imagination like those of\nPioneers 10 and 11. These unmanned\nrobots completed 22-month, 640million-mile journeys into the outer\nsolar system to whip past the giant\nplanet Jupiter at altitudes of 81,000\nmiles and 29,000 miles.\nPioneer 10, passed Jupiter on Dec.\n3,1973, and rode the planet\'s gravity\ninto a new trajectory that will take it\nout of the solar system into the great\n\nMariner 10 took three close looks at\nheavily-cratered Mercury (below) and\none at cloud-cloaked Venus (top,\nopposite page), discovering, among\nother things, that the Venusian cloud\npatterns may provide important clues\nto understanding weather on Earth.\n\nPioneers 10 and 11 found the giant\nplanet Jupiter (bottom, opposite page)\nhad a hotter core than expected.\n\ngalactic veil beyond, the first object\nof man on a course to the stars.\nPioneer 11 glided past Jupiter on\nDec. 2,1974 and. using the pull of\nJovian gravity, curved back across\nthe solar system f o r a 1979 rendezvous with the ringed wonder of our\nplanetary system, Saturn.\nWhat the Pioneers found out about\nJupiter bolstered the theory that it\nis a huge spinning ball of what is\nalmost entirely liquid hydrogen. Its\nGreat Red Spot may be the vortex of\na storm, not unlike a hurricane, which\nrages over 20,000 miles and towers\nlike an Earthly thunderhead some\n5 miles above the surrounding clouds.\nThe storm apparently has been in\nprogress for hundreds of years.\nJupiter turned out to be even hotter\nthan many had expected, perhaps as\nmuch as 30,000 degrees C (54,000\ndegrees F) at its core. This is nearly\nsix times as hot as the surface of the\nSun. The temperatures abate from the\ncenter outward, falling to about \xe2\x80\x9412\ndegrees C (10 degrees F) just below\nthe cloud tops.\nCould life exist under such\nconditions?\nThe answer is a qualified yes.\nPresumably in a region somewhere\nbetween the holocaust at the Jovian\ncore and the chill among the clouds,\nthere are temperatures as moderate\nas Earth dwellers like in their homes.\nIn such a region, from the methane,\nammonia, and water known to be in\nJupiter\'s atmosphere and the activity\nseen to be seething there, life could\nburgeon. But Jupiter\'s high winds and\nviolent updrafts and downdrafts\ncould be killing off any organisms as\nfast as they form.\n\nScientist-astronaut rakes up rocks and\nrock-chip samples in the TaurusLittrow region of the Moon.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\n-\n\n-*\n\nWeather on Jupiter differs greatly\nfrom that on Earth. High and low\npressure systems, which tend to be\ncircular on Earth, girdle Jupiter in\ncolorful ribbons of cloud, the brighter\nbands representing rising columns of\nair, the dark ones descending columns. The unvarying heat from\nJupiter\'s fiery core tends to continuously generate the bands.\nThe Pioneers also had a look at\nJupiter\'s big inner moons\xe2\x80\x94lo,\nGanymede, Europa, and Callisto\xe2\x80\x94and\nfound that at least one of them, lo,\nhas an atmosphere. Pictures disclosed that Callisto has a small ice\ncap at its South Pole and revealed\nlight and dark areas on Ganymede\nthat resemble features of the Moon\nand Mars.\nPlanetary data may soon contribute\nsubstantially to a better understanding of the actions of plasmas,\nelectrically conductive gases. Lack of\nknowledge about plasma dynamics\nis preventing the achievement of\ncontrolled thermonuclear fusion,\nwhich would solve Earth\'s energy\nproblems for centuries to come.\nUnfortunately, plasmas are extremely\ndifficult to study and understand on a\nsmall scale that can be tested in a\nlaboratory. Much of our understanding is coming from space where great\nplasma fields exist naturally.\nPioneer 10 and Mariner 10 studies\nof the Jupiter and Mercury magnetospheres have shown thermoplasma\neffects that were totally unexpected.\nPlasma physicists now have new\ndata of an entirely different nature to\nimprove their basic understanding of\nthe dynamics of plasmas.\nOne may confidently predict that\n\nplanetary exploration and its offshoots\nwill continue to advance in importance. Meteorologists trying to better\nunderstand Earth\'s weather, atmospheric pollution, and climate effects\nhave been among the strongest\nadvocates of the Pioneer Venus missions which will study Venus in 1978.\nSimilarly, the strongest supporters\nof the Viking missions that will softland payloads on the Martian surface\nhave been biologists struggling to\nbetter understand life processes on\nEarth. They believe that any evidence\nwhich Viking will return on the processes which lead to the evolution of\nlife will make a major contribution\nto the science of biology.\nSteady progress is being made\ntoward improving the picture of how\nthe Earth and all the other planets\nformed and evolved in the solar\nsystem. One picture gaining credence\nis that the planets evolved from a\nsimilar origin into different states\ndictated by their proximity to the Sun\nand their relative sizes. Venus, being\ncloser to the Sun than Earth, has\nadvanced to the state where water\nhas been driven off and carbonates\nbroken down in the crust to create a\nthick atmosphere of carbon dioxide,\nmaking the planet totally uninhabitable. Many scientists believe that\nEarth is heading in this direction and\nthat the evolutionary process which\nwould normally take several billion\nyears could be drastically accelerated\nby the polluting effects of man and\nhis machines.\nMars appears to be trailing in\nevolution and is still in the process\nof forming its atmosphere and reaching a state of persisting liquid water\n\nTechnician examines one of largest\nrock samples returned from the Moon,\na coarse-grained breccia and clastic\nrock weighing 8.98 kilograms (19.8\npounds).\n\non the surface. At least one leading\nscientist predicts that Mars will reach\na habitable state at just about the\ntime that Earth is becoming uninhabitable, and that human civilization\nwill then migrate to colonize Mars.\nWhether this is true or not, it is safe\nto predict that a further study and\ncomparison of the planets will give us\nthe knowledge to better control\nspacecraft Earth, and prevent, or at\nleast slow down, the process of\ngetting into a runaway, uninhabitable\nstate like Venus.\nInvestigations of the Moon are\ncontinuing as well from material\nbrought back by Apollo expeditions\nand data still being sent back by the\nApollo Lunar Surface Experiment\nPackages which the astronauts left\nbehind. As a result, knowledge and\ntheories of the Earth\'s earliest years\nhave advanced. Study of large lunar\nboulders picked up on Apollo 17\nestablished that one of them was 4.7\nbillion years old.\nLess than two decades after the\nbirth of the Space Age, we have\nwritten the preliminary chapters to\nthe first phase of exploration of the\nsolar system.\n\nAeronautics\n\nModified Navy F-8\'s become NASA\nexperimental aircraft for flight research\nand test of advanced concepts.\n\nOblique-wing concept of an air transport (viewed from above) has wing at\nright angles for takeoff and landing, left,\nand in canted position, right, for highspeed cruise.\n\nIn 1974, fuel conservation became a\nhousehold fact of life. In aeronautics,\nincreased fuel costs and the possibility of reduced supplies raise the\nspectre of curtailed air transportation\nin the future that could have serious\neconomic and social consequences.\nAs a result, NASA is sharply focusing attention on identifying and\ndeveloping new technologies to\nachieve higher operating efficiences\nwith existing aircraft and to produce\nlarge fuel savings in the next generation of air transports.\nNASA has identified technologies,\nboth near-term and those that can be\nready in 10 years, with the potential\nof reducing fuel requirements of\ncommercial jet aircraft by as much as\n50 percent. If these advances were\nincorporated into the number of\ncommercial aircraft flying in the U. S.\ntoday\xe2\x80\x94approximately 2,100\xe2\x80\x94it\nwould save nearly 350,000 barrels of\noil per day. When based on estimates\nof fleet size in the 1985-90 time period,\nsavings could reach as high as 45.6\nbillion liters (12 billion gallons) of jet\nfuel annually, or nearly 1 million barrels of oil every day. This translates\ninto a hefty $3 billion each year.\nThese savings will be achieved\nthrough reduced air resistance (drag),\nreduced weight, more efficient engines and control systems, new design concepts and better operating\nprocedures in the air and on the\nground.\nStudies show that a supercritical\nwing developed by NASA can effectively reduce both drag and weight.\nA jet aircraft using the wing has been\nflown successfully, and virtually all\naircraft companies are planning to\n\nIllustrations depect promising applications of advanced technologies to a\nfuel-thrifty commercial aircraft concept\n(bottom) and, to light aircraft (top).\nGAW-1 is a version of the NASAdeveloped supercritical wing.\n\nuse some version of it. Supercritical\nwings can increase aircraft fuel efficiency by about 15 percent.\nAnother NASA design innovation,\nthe oblique wing, potentially can\nenable high-speed aircraft to use less\nfuel than current swept-winged jets\nduring takeoff and landing and while\ncruising at high altitudes. The wing\ncrosses the airplane\'s fuselage at\nright angles for takeoff and landing\nand pivots to cross diagonally for\nhigh-speed flight.\nOther design features to reduce air\nfriction and drag include small winglets mounted on the wingtips to break\nup spiraling wind patterns and porous\nor slotted skins for wing, tail and\nfuselage surfaces.\nAn advanced flight control system,\ncalled digital fly-by-wire, which is\nfast acting and computer coordinated\nhas been tested by NASA. Equipping\naircraft with this system not only\nwill improve handling qualities and\nenhance flight safety, but can be used\nindirectly to reduce aerodynamic\nloads and structural weight. Lightweight wires replace the heavy system of metal rods, hinges and\nhydraulic lines that previously translated the pilot\'s signal from the\ncockpit to the aircraft\'s control surfaces. The total weight reduction can\nsignificantly increase passenger and\ncargo capacity per gallon of fuel. It\nis estimated that aircraft modified\nwith fly-by-wire systems could fly\nabout 15 percent farther on the same\namount of fuel. Airplanes built with\nthe system from the outset would do\neven better.\nComposite materials\xe2\x80\x94strong,\nlightweight combinations of metals\n\nAdvanced Technology Airfoil (GAW-1)\nConventional Airfoil (65 Series)\n\nBoundary Layer\nIngestion\n\nAir Injection\n\nActive Control\nSystem\n\n21\n\nand plastics such as boron or\ngraphite epoxy\xe2\x80\x94that can reduce aircraft weights by more than 30 percent\ncompared to aluminum structures are\nbeing developed and tested by NASA\nin collaboration with manufacturers\nand airlines. Composite materials\nused for aircraft construction could\nrealize fuel savings of 10 to 15\npercent.\nToday\'s fan-jet engines are marvels\nof efficiency compared to the first\njet engines that entered commercial\nservice in 1958, delivering about three\ntimes the passenger miles per gallon.\nFuel-conservative engines that are\nlighter, cleaner burning and 20 percent more efficient are being studied\nby NASA. In addition, research is\nunderway on advanced engine designs involving completely new\nconcepts. For example, a new engine\ncycle that reuses engine exhaust heat\nis expected to consume 30 percent\nless fuel than today\'s most efficient\naircraft powerplants.\nA variable-cycle engine which is\nsomewhat analogous to the variable\nsweep wing used on advanced military aircraft like the F-111 is also\nunder study. Here, the internal engine\ngeometry rather than the wing\ngeometry is altered in flight. Operating in a sense as a gear shift, it\npermits the engine airflow and direction of thrust to be adjusted for\neffective low-noise operation during\ntakeoff and landing while maintaining\nhigh efficiency for supersonic cruise.\nSignificant fuel savings are predicted\nfor the new engine.\nDependence on petroleum and\nother fossil fuel sources may be reduced considerably through use of\n\nsynthetic hydrocarbon fuels (derived\nfrom coal and oil) under investigation\nby NASA and the military services.\nLiquid hydrogen is also of interest\nbecause of its high energy to weight\nratio. The most formidable problems\nassociated with synthetic fuels lie in\nthe system support areas of economical production, liquefaction, distribution, storage and handling.\nPerhaps the greatest potential for\nairtransport growth in the future is\nin the air freight field. Projected demand suggests the eventual development of very large air vehicles that\nwill dwarf the largest wide-body\ntransports flying today. NASA studies\ninclude consideration of lighter-thanair and semi-buoyant vehicles as well\nas conventional aircraft.\nLarge dirigibles using engines and\nwind for movement could carry enormous cargoes. The advantages in\nfuel consumption, noise and pollution\nare obvious.\nLarge, conventional cargo aircraft\nmight carry their freight loads in the\nwings rather than the body. This\nwould permit savings in structural\nweight since the distributed load\nbalances the aerodynamic lift forces\non the wing. The result is a potential\npayload increase on the order of\n50 percent, with a corresponding\ndecrease in operating cost and fuel\nper ton-mile.\nOther advanced concepts being\nstudied by NASA include: coupled\naircraft in which the efficiency of\nwing-loading is augmented by individual smaller aircraft that can be\nhooked together to form larger flight\nunits; tandem aircraft in which the\nlarge loads are carried in the body\n\nbut supported by two wings; and\nlarge, conventional, low-speed airplanes in which advanced technology\nis deliberately avoided in favor of design simplicity and production costs.\nAs every businessman knows, time\nand money are directly proportional.\nIn aeronautics, time spent in the air\nand on landing is directly related to\nfuel consumption, as well as traffic\ncongestion and safety.\nRecent studies by NASA include\ndrag brakes for steeper approaches,\nmore efficient air and runway traffic\ncontrol and high-capacity landing\ngears for quick runway turnoffs.\nSophisticated cockpit displays and\nautomatic landing systems are being\ndeveloped to reduce the pilot\'s workload and to permit routine maneuvers\nbeyond the capability of an unaided\npilot. The control and dissipation of\ntrailing vortices (miniature tornadoes\ngenerated by the wings of large\naircraft) will permit reduced aircraft\nlanding separations, from the present\n\nCargo containers enter wing of\nfuturistic air transport.\n\nAeronautics research in NASA extends\nfrom the high-performance YF-12\n(below) right down to the noise on the\nground around airports. The YF-12 is\none of two at the Flight Research Center\nwhich provide information for the\ndesign of future aircraft. The Boeing 727\n(bottom) has smoke pots near its\n\nwingtips to show the spiraling vortices\nwhich require smaller planes to keep\n8 kilometers (5miles)back, thus\naggravating delays around airports.\n\n23\n\nIn an effort to improve light aircraft\nstructures, available airframes are\nsuspended and swung into the ground\nto simulate actual crash conditions\nand evaluate safety concepts.\n\nthree to five miles to about one or two\nmiles, thereby decreasing congestion\nand stacking over and around\nterminals.\nNASA technology also is being\napplied to noise reduction and aircraft design innovations for utility of\nservice at air terminals.\nIn aircraft noise reduction, NASA\ncan report good results from steeper\napproaches to airports, which keeps\nplanes higher over much of the surrounding community and curtails the\nnoise heard on the ground. In cooperation with the Federal Aviation\nAdministration, the procedure was\ntested in regular airline passenger\nservice. A United Air Lines DC-8\nequipped with a sophisticated navigation system modified to suit such\nlanding approaches succeeded in\ntrimming the area of objectionable\nnoise under the approach path by\nabout 53 percent.\nNASA has ground-tested and flight\ntested a modified JT8D jet engine\nthat could reduce by at least 75 percent the total ground area affected by\nobjectionable noise during approach\nand take-off. The JT8D engine is\nused in airliners that comprise over\n60 percent of commercial aircraft\nused in the United States.\nFor the future, there is a promise\nof noise reduction in the redesign of\nengines and engine nacelles (housings). NASA also is working on shorthaul experimental engines which\nwould enable airplanes to use small\nairports close to terminal cities, not\nonly reducing engine noise and exhaust, but also the need for new or\nexpanded jetports. About 80 percent\nof air travel involves short-haul opera-\n\n24\n\ntions: intercity flights of under 500\nmiles.\nA tilt-rotor aircraft is under study\nfor similar short-hop service. It has\nlarge rotors on its wingtips for vertical\ntakeoff and landing, but when airborne, the rotors tilt forward for cruise\nlike a conventional turboprop airplane. Under a NASA-U. S. Army program, two tilt-rotor research aircraft\nwere scheduled for delivery in 1975.\nOther research projects underway\nby NASA include the Remotely Piloted\nResearch Vehicle program where the\ntest pilot flies the aircraft from a\ncockpit on the ground. The advantage\nof this NASA-developed technique is\nthat advanced technology can be\ninvestigated and high risk maneuvers\ncan be performed very early in the\nflight test program without danger to\nthe pilot. Additionally, scale models\nof aircraft are used that do not have\nto be man-rated. Consequently, a\nremotely-piloted flight test program\nmay cost less than half that of a\nfull-scale manned program. It is\npossible that remotely-piloted vehicles will in the future be found\nuseful for specialized civil applications such as monitoring of severe\nstorms, forest fire detection, fire\nfighting, disaster assistance, and deliveries to isolated locations.\nTrends in aviation over the next two\ndecades will be influenced by research and technology programs\nbeing conducted by NASA in cooperation with other federal agencies and\nthe private sector. Aircraft noise impact on communities will be reduced\ndrastically, and, above all, they will\nbe fuel conservative to meet the\nrealities of the energy shortage.\n\n/i\n\nTwo tilt-rotor aircraft similar to the one\nabove will be tested for short-hop service\nunder a NASA-U. S. Army contract.\n\nAircraft in Langley wind tunnel was\nmodified to obtain greater aerodynamic\nlift while using the wing to shield some\nengine noise from persons below.\n\nHush-hush work that many will want to\nhear about continues at the Lewis\nResearch Center on the world\'s quietest\njet engine. Its performance with an\nacoustically-treated, sound-dampening\nintake is being measured.\n\nf\n\n"*T.\n\n25\n\n<J\n\nShuttle\n\nEconomical, routine and simplified\naccess to Earth orbit.\nThat\'s the promise of the reusable\nSpace Shuttle for all users\xe2\x80\x94civil or\ndefense, foreign or domestic, environmentalist or energy seekerbeginning in 1980, about a year after\nthe new space transportation system\nmakes its first manned orbital flight.\nThat\'s the time when space activities will experience a dramatic savings in terms of launching costs and\nexpenditures for spacecraft and\nspacecraft components\xe2\x80\x94welcome\nnews for both commercial and nonprofit user organizations.\nThe Shuttle system is being developed by the United States to make\nspace operations less complex and\nless costly as we continue to place\nsuch useful items as weather and\ncommunications satellites in orbit;\nto encourage mutually-beneficial international cooperation in space enterprises; and to extend human\nmobility (manned operations) in the\nspace environment.\nThere are four major elements in\nthe Shuttle system\xe2\x80\x94the Orbiter, the\nOrbiter\'s main engines (that use liquid\npropellants), the external tank (for\nthe liquid propellants), and the solid\npropellant boosters. The external tank\nis the only element that is expendable.\nThe Orbiter will be mated at launch\n\nto the large external tank and two\nsolid-fuel rockets. Both solid rockets\nand the Orbiter\'s liquid-fueled engines will ignite at launch.\nWhen the Shuttle reaches an altitude of about 40 kilometers (25 miles),\nthe spent solid rockets will detach and\nparachute into the ocean to be recovered. The spacecraft will proceed\ntoward Earth orbit. When the big\npropellant tank is no longer needed,\nthat too will be jettisoned.\nThe Shuttle can function as an\nEarth-orbiting space station for as\nlong as 30 days when it carries\nSpacelab in its payload bay. (See\npage 33). It can launch, retrieve, and\nrepair orbiting satellites. At the end\nof the mission the piloted Orbiter\nwill return to Earth and land like an\nairplane. It will then be refurbished\nfor its next mission.\nThe Orbiter element, about the size\nof a DC-9 air transport, may be flown\nat least 100 times and perhaps as\nmany as 500 times. The solid rockets\ncan be reused 20 times.\nThe capability to repair and retrieve\norbiting satellites means the satellites\nthemselves can be made less expensively. Reliability requirements can be\nrelaxed. For example, costly standby\nelectronics systems and subsystems\ncan be eliminated.\nSomewhat later in the Shuttle\'s\n\nfuture lies the Space Tug, an unmanned reusable stage that will ride\nin the Shuttle\'s cargo bay and make\nit possible for the Shuttle to launch\ninterplanetary probes or put spacecraft into far higher Earth orbits. It will\nbe able to retrieve some satellites.\nNASA has reached agreement with\nthe Department of Defense for the\nAir Force to develop the Interim\nUpper Stage, an early version of the\nSpace Tug. The Interim Upper Stage\nmay not be able to retrieve Earth\nsatellites but may be reusable.\n\nSpace Shuttle is keeping to a schedule\nintended to have it start service in 1980.\nIt has an Orbiter which can retrieve, repair, and, as shown below, launch\nsatellites. It has a Spacelab payload,\n(shown in the artist\'s cutaway at bottom)\nin which scientists and engineers can\nwork in shirtsleeves for periods of up\nto 30 days in Earth orbit. When the\nmission is complete, the Orbiter returns\nto Earth and lands like an airplane.\n\nA full-scale mockup of the Space\nShuttle Orbiter, with some help from an\nartist, looked like this when unveiled in\n1974 at Downey, California. At launch\n(bottom), as the artist sees it, the\nShuttle lifts off with all engines burning.\nSoon after launch, the Orbiter will\n\njettison two solid-fuel rockets and, just\nbefore going into Earth orbit, cast off\nthe large propellant tank.\n\niti\n\ni\n\nInternational\n\nCow grazes peacefully near 210-foot\ntracking antenna which keeps radio\ncontact with interplanetary spacecraft\nfrom this site near Madrid, Spain.

Helios 1 was launched in\nDecember on a mission to study the\nSun.\n\nThe Apollo-Soyuz efforts that focused\non the meeting of American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts in\nEarth orbit in 1975 have paralleled\nanother significant example of worldwide cooperation in space, Spacelab.\nSpacelab will be brought into Earth\norbit aboard the Space Shuttle (see\npage 26) and will remain in the payload bay throughout each mission.\nIn Spacelab\'s shirt-sleeve environment, scientists and engineers of\nmany countries can carry out experiments requiring 7 to 30 days of\nsupervision in orbit.\nThe European Space Agency is\ndesigning and building Spacelab to its\nown and NASA specifications, with\nfunds raised from member nations.\nThe organization awarded a $226 million Spacelab development contract\nto a consortium headed by VFW\nFokker/ERNO of the Federal Republic\nof Germany. The whole project will\ncost the European nations more than\n$400 million in today\'s dollars.\nApollo-Soyuz opens the way to an\ninternational, Earth-orbit rescue\ncapability and to future international\nmanned space missions that would\neliminate duplications of effort and\nthereby contribute to economies and\nprogress in space operations. The\nexpense and complexity of certain\nspace activities are far beyond the\nmeans of some nations, particularly\nless-developed ones.\nThe mutual confidence and trust\ndeveloped in joint space ventures\nmay be significant not just for what\npeoples working together may accomplish in orbit but also from what\npeoples working together may\nachieve on Earth.\n\nOf the six scientific satellites\nlaunched by NASA during 1974, five\nwere built and paid for by other countries.

There, this electronic explorer will scan and scratch for\neverything it can discover about the\nplanet, especially any evidence of\nsome form of life. The name of this\nMars analyst? The Viking lander, a\nspindly robot with the constitution of\na biological and chemical laboratory.\nMars, the most Earth-like of all the\nplanets in the Solar System, is enjoying a revival of great scientific interest\nthanks to the surprising 1972 findings\nof Mariner 9 which orbited and\nmapped the red planet in unprecedented detail. A new Mars was unveiled: an active-type planet, one with\nmajor volcanic regions, a huge rift\nvalley running along its equator,\nnumerous features that looked like\neroded stream beds and a strange\nlayered terrain in the polar areas. The\nregion around the southern polar cap\nis extensively eroded as if by glacial\naction and other pits and slumps\nresemble ice-formed features on\nEarth. Based on Mariner9 results.it is\nnow believed that frozen water deposits exist beneath the Martian poles.\nViking instruments thatwill be used\non the surface and in orbit around\nMars will tell us more about the\nplanet, possible origins of life and the\npossible prospects for our own environment. Since our Earth and the\nother Solar System planets were\nformed in the same period, 4.6 billion\nyears ago, anything we can learn\nabout the evolution of one may tell us\nmuch about another.\nTwo Viking spacecraft will help us\nfind out if Mars knows something\nwe don\'t know.\nThe two Vikings will be launched\n10 days apart from NASA\'s John F.\nKennedy Space Center in Florida in\nAugust 1975. They will reach Mars\nabout a week apart in late June 1976\n\nand start orbiting the planet.\nAfter checking on the suitability of\na pre-chosen landing place, each\nViking will cut loose its lander portion\nfor descent while the orbiter elements\nmake observations of Mars as they\ncircle the planet. The orbiters will\nrelay to Earth stations data radioed\nfrom the landers.\nOn the way down, the landers will\ncollect information about the Martian\natmosphere. Upon putting down, the\nlanders will go to work as automated\nweather, television, and seismographic stations; biological and\nchemical laboratories; and robot explorers. For exploration, the landers\nhave retractable claws with magnetometers and pressure sensors that\ncan reach out 10 feet and TV camera\neyes which can see in color, black\nand white, and, when focussed on the\nsame scene, stereo. The cameras can\nbe aimed to scan from the lander\'s own\nnearest footpad to an angle 40 degrees\n\nabove the horizon. The Earth bound\nexperimenters can see through the "eyes"\nof the lander and manipulate the claw to\nsample the surface of Mars.\nThe Viking orbiter, is the responsibility of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A far more complex spacecraft,\nthe Viking Lander is the responsibility\nof the Langley Research Center. Langley must sterilize the lander so that,\nwhen searching out Martian life, if\nany, it does not find organisms delivered there by itself. To avoid that\nscientific calamity, the lander is being\nthoroughly cleaned and baked at\ntemperatures no cooler than 114\ndegrees C (236 degrees F.)\nLangley had to design, develop and\ntest equipment for the lander that\nwould work after so severe a baking.\nIt was done. During 1974 a complete\nlander underwent repeated heat\nsterilization. This new technology,\ntoo, is expected to have applications\nin health and industry.\n\nDiscarded capsule cover and chute\nrest (top left) on surface of Mars near\nViking lander as orbiter passes overhead.

From Skylab will come many\nof the technical and scientific developments which may prove a decisive factor in our struggle with the\ngrowing problems of our evolving\ncivilization.\nSkylab had several distinct purposes: to enrich our scientific knowledge of the Earth, Sun, stars and\ncosmic space; to study the effects of\nweightlessness on living organisms,\nincluding man; to develop methods\nfor processing and manufacturing\nmaterials in the vacuum and zero\ngravity of space; and to investigate\nmeans of observing and monitoring\nthe Earth\'s surface to support the\nneeds of man. Most importantly,\nSkylab sought to evaluate the capabilities, limitations and usefulness of\nman as a scientist in space.\nThe nation\'s pioneering space\nstation program proved beyond doubt\nthat man can function effectively for\nextended periods in space, and\nclearly demonstrated that he possesses unique advantages over automatic satellites, that he can gather\notherwise unavailable scientific data\nand, if necessary, complete difficult\nrepair and construction jobs that, left\nunattended, could reduce a mission\'s\neffectiveness, even doom it to failure.\nHere\'s the final photographic look at\nthe now deserted Skylab, shot from\nthe Command Module by a member\nof the last departing crew. The\nastronauts, Gerald P. Carr, Edward G.\nGibson, and William R. Pogue, splashed\ndown February 8, 1974.\n\nIn short, Skylab emphasized that in\nspace as well as on Earth there is no\nsubstitute for man\'s adaptability and\nresourcefulness.\nSkylab 4 astronauts Gerald Carr,\nEdward Gibson and William Pogue\ntoppled space records with abandon,\nspending more time in space than any\nother men before, including two\nrecord work spans outside their space\nstation of 61/2 to 7 hours. Yet, after\nreturning to Earth, they adapted to\nthe terrestrial environment more\nquickly and proved to be in better\nphysical condition than their predecessors on the Skylab 2 and Skylab 3\nmissions.* Doctors attributed their\ngood condition to the daily exercises\nand nutritional supplements that were\ndeveloped as a result of the two\nprevious flights.\nSkylab biomedical findings indicate that there are no medical reasons\nwhy man cannot be committed to\nlong duration space missions in\nEarth orbit or on years\' long missions\nto the other planets of the solar\nsystem, provided he has a proper diet\nand adequately programmed exercise, sleep, work and recreational\nperiods.\nSkylab astronauts gave particular\nattention to studies of the Earth.\nUsing complex Earth sensors, radar\nand high-resolution photography,\nthey surveyed their world below as\n\nSaturn 1B roars from its launch pad at\nKennedy Space Center with the third\nand last Skylab crew. The three astronauts set records for time in orbit and\nwork outside the spacecraft.\n\'The Skylab 1 mission was an unmanned launch\nthat put the Skylab space station in orbit. The\nthree Skylab crews were ferried to and from the\nSkylab by Apollo spacecraft.\nSkylab 2 (28 days)\xe2\x80\x94Joseph Kerwin, Charles\nConrad and Paul Weitz.\nSkylab 3 (59Vi days)\xe2\x80\x94Owen Garriott. Alan Bean\nand Jack Lousma.\n\nnever before. Hardly a branch of\nEarfh science was overlooked, from\nagriculture to forestry, hydrology,\ngeology, geography, meteorology,\noceanography and ecology.\nAmong the findings were:\nswirling pools of cool water in the\ncomparatively warm Gulf Stream\nthat may affect the weather.\nindications of underground water\nin drought-stricken West Africa.\nthe effects of strip mining in Illinois,\nIndiana and Kentucky.\npossible mineral and oil deposits\nin various locations around the\nworld, including the possibility of\nplacer gold in alluvial streambeds\nin the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\nstartling proof that the mapping of\nthe world\'s oceans and land masses\ncan be done quickly and accurately\nfrom space in a matter of days\ninstead of years using conventional\nmethods.\nthat space is the ideal platform for\nmonitoring the world\'s agricultural\nresources, marine life, urban development and such scourges as\ndrought, pollution and hurricanes.\nSkylab established that orbiting\nspace stations operated by men using\nsophisticated camera systems and\nelectronic sensors could play a key\nrole in providing information for managing our limited natural resources\nand protecting our endangered\nenvironment.\nEven though gravity and atmosphere are necessary for man\'s normal\nexistence on Earth, they have kept\nhim from perfecting the end products\n\nof many manufacturing processes.\nThe special conditions of virtual\nweightlessness and vacuum intrinsic\nto orbital flight make it possible to\nperform operations in materials processing that would be impossible or\nprohibitively difficult on Earth. Melting\nand mixing without the contaminating\neffects of containers, the suppression\nof convection currents and buoyancy\nin liquids and molten material, the\ncontrol of voids, and the ability to use\nelectrostatic and magnetic forces\notherwise masked by gravity, open\nthe way to a new knowledge of material properties and processes, and\nmay ultimately lead to the development of valuable new products for\nuse on Earth.\nIt was expected that zero gravity\nand vacuum would have a favorable\neffect on the manufacture of metal\nalloys, composite materials, crystals\nand vaccines\xe2\x80\x94and Skylab results\ndid not disappoint.\nExperiments show that in the absence of gravity various metal alloys\ncan be strengthened by a uniform\ndistribution of fibers in much the same\nmanner that concrete is reinforced by\nthe addition of steel rods. This is\ndifficult to achieve on Earth because\nthe fibers tend to "float" out of the\nmolten metal when it is compressed\nto squeeze out voids or empty\npockets. In zero gravity, the fibers\nstay put. Metals of this type exhibit\nhigh-strength/low-weight characteristics, and should be a significant\ncontribution to the structural material\nfield.\nAnother advantage of weightlessness is the capacity to suspend\nliquids or molten solids without using\n\na container which can introduce\nundesirable stresses and contamination during solidification. This could\nbe of importance in the production\nof high quality crystals and semiconductors used in solid state electronics (especially computers), lasers\nand electro-optical devices. Skylab\nexperimenters demonstrated the\nproduction of crystals in space of a\nsize and purity impossible to attain\non Earth. Furthermore, it is possible\nthat crystals produced in space would\nbe ready for immediate use in electronic devices without having to undergo the normal, tedious cutting and\npolishing operations now required.\nSkylab studies of the Sun were the\nmost extensive and rewarding in the\nhistory of man. Since the Sun is the\nsource of all life and energy on Earth,\nit is imperative that we understand\nits effects and processes.\nFor example, the Sun provides the\nenergy that drives the atmosphere\nand is responsible for the weather.\nVariations in local solar input give\nrise to seasons. "Solar energy" lifts\nwater vapor from the oceans and lets\nit rain down on land and in reservoirs\nfor hydroelectric power plants. Oil\nand coal contain solar energy stored\nby life forms millions of years ago.\nUltraviolet and X-ray emissions\nfrom the Sun are responsible for our\nionosphere which is essential to\nradio communications. Another vital\nproduct of solar ultraviolet radiation\nis the Earth\'s ozone layer in the upper\natmosphere. Ozone, once formed by\nthe interaction of molecular oxygen\nwith the ultraviolet radiation itself,\nabsorbs ultraviolet, preventing most\nof it from reaching the surface. With-\n\nSkylab looked like this from above. The\nround shadow is the departing Command\nModule on its last "fly around" of the\nghost ship.\n\nIn-flight photo shows Skylab astronaut positioned before the instrument\nconsole from which he controlled\noperations of the space station\'s solar\nphysics telescopes.\n\nCircular curtain that attached to ceiling,\na push-button shower head, and a\nsuction hose to remove water droplets\nhelped make taking a shower possible\nin weightlessness of Skylab.\n\n35\n\nout ozone shielding, life on Earth\nwould be impossible.\nSolar flares, the sudden release of\nimmense energy and material from\nthe Sun\'s surface, produce massive\ndisturbances in the solar wind\xe2\x80\x94a\nsheath of hot, electrified gas particles\nracing outward from the Sun that\nbathes the planets in radiation\xe2\x80\x94\ncausing magnetic storms on Earth\nthat disrupt communications, knock\nout commercial power systems, interfere with sensitive instrumentation\n\nFlare on the Sun, photographed by\nthe last Skylab crew, arcs more than\n367,000 miles across the surface.\n\n36\n\nand create the brilliant auroral displays in the far northern and southern latitudes. These Sun-generated\nstorms appear to affect global\nweather patterns as well, and may\nproduce climatic changes whose consequences can be both productive\nand catastrophic.\nThe Sun serves as a laboratory for\nunderstanding plasmas or high-temperature gases that conduct electricity and interact with magnetic fields,\nholding forth the promise of new\nenergy sources here on Earth such\nas nuclear fusion\xe2\x80\x94the process of\nthe stars\xe2\x80\x94which would give man an\ninexhaustible supply of cheap, nonpolluting energy.\nThe Sun is also our bridge to the\nstudy of other stars. The more we\nknow about the Sun, the only star\nclose enough to study in detail, the\nmore we can use it as a reference\npoint for understanding what is\nhappening on other stars. Conversely,\nsince other stars are in different\nstages of evolution, they picture the\npast and future of our Sun.\nTelescopic images of the Sun in the\nvisible, ultraviolet and X-ray portions\nof the spectrum taken by the Skylab\nastronauts, which cannot be obtained\nfrom the ground because of the\nEarth\'s atmosphere, confirmed many\nprevious theories and disclosed much\nthat was new. For example, they\nstrengthened evidence that the solar\ncorona\xe2\x80\x94the active, gaseous envelope surrounding the Sun\xe2\x80\x94is more\ndynamic, complex and changeable\nthan previously thought. And that\nmuch of the solar wind may escape\ninto space through mysterious holes\nin the corona that are much cooler\n\nand more rarified than the rest of the\ncorona.\nSkylab data indicated that prominences\xe2\x80\x94condensed arches of hot,\nluminous gases rising from the Sun\xe2\x80\x94\nerupt more frequently than expected.\nFor the first time, the birth, growth\nand subsidence of a solar flare was\nrecorded. It was discovered also that\nactive regions on the Sun sometimes\nsignal impending flare activity by\nbecoming brighter in different parts\nof the region. This factor may eventually give us the capability to predict\nthe onset of flares hours in advance.\nThe reservoir of information about\nthe Sun accumulated during the\nSkylab missions will require years of\nintensive study. Like a pistol shot\nthat can trigger an avalanche, each\nnew discovery will widen our understanding of the most important of our\ncelestial neighbors.\nHowever disappointing to observers on Earth, Comet Kohoutek gave\nthe Skylab astronauts a unique opportunity. The comet, discovered far out\nin space in March 1973, was sighted\nby the astronauts on December 13,\n1973. They promptly focussed their\ninstruments on it, making daily observations as it swept toward the Sun\nand then sped away. (NASA also\ncollected data on Kohoutek via the\nunmanned spacecraft Mariner 10, the\nOrbiting Astronomical Observatory,\nsounding rockets, high altitude balloons, aircraft, and ground observatories.)\nThe result was a significant contribution to cometary physics. For\nexample, observations on the amount\nof hydrogen carried from the nucleus\nof Kohoutek at separate stages of its\n\nShortly before the end of the Skylab\nmission, Scientist-Astronaut Edward G.\nGibson climbed out of the hatchway to\nbegin the crew\'s final extra-vehicular\nactivity. From above the obscuring\natmosphere of the Earth, the astronauts\ngot a unique opportunity to observe\nComet Kohoutek.\nsweep clearly showed the development and decline of its huge hydrogen halo. Scientists concluded that\nthe comet ejected more material\nbefore than after perihelion (closest\napproach to the Sun). This suggested\nthat Kohoutek had never been close\nto the Sun before and, therefore, was\non its first visit to our part of the\nsolar system.\nToday, Skylab is a ghost ship,\ndestined to circle the Earth dark and\nvacant for as long as 10 years. In\ntime, it will drift down into the denser\npart of the atmosphere. Eventually,\natmospheric friction will heat and\ncause it to break apart, falling to Earth\nlike a meteor shower in a fiery finale\nto a brilliant career.\nSkylab, in all its aspects, has\ndemonstrated that this nation is capable of conducting broader and more\nuseful beneficial activities in space\nthat directly relate to our own planet\nEarth. It has served as a true orbiting\nresearch facility enabling our astronauts to carry out a wide spectrum of\nscientific, engineering and biomedical\nstudies.\nResults of Skylab experiments,\nbesides enriching our knowledge in\ntechnology and science, will undoubtedly influence many other space\nprojects to be developed by the\nUnited States and others during\nforthcoming years, A new generation\nof manned orbiting flights, again expanding our capabilities in space and\nthe utility of space flight for man on\nEarth, will begin with the Space\nShuttle Program around the end of\nthe 1970\'s. The Shuttle Program, too,\nwill profit decisively from Skylab, our\nfirst station in space.\n\nBelow: Orbiting spectroheliograph\nproduced portrait of the Sun. White represents greatest heat and color code\nscales down through yellow, red and\nblue. Dark areas are coronal holes\ninvestigated by Skylab instruments.\n\nEnergy\n\nIn cooperation with the Energy Research and Development Administration, NASA is applying aerospace\ntechnology to help meet critical national needs for both conserving\nenergy and developing new, renewable, economically practicable, and\nenvironmentally acceptable energy\nsources.\nIn one program, NASA is improving\nand demonstrating solar collector systems that absorb heat from the Sun to\nheat and cool buildings. NASA\'s work\non thermal coatings for spacecraft is\nbeing applied to improve the efficiency of solar collectors. An experimental house at the NASA Marshall\nSpace FlightCenter will ultimately\nderive 85 percent of its heating and\ncooling from a solar collector system.\nAt NASA\'s Langley Research Center,\na new 53,000-square-foot office building is to derive as much as 90 percent\nof its heating and 50 percent of its\ncooling from a solar collector system\nthat is part of an experimental, largescale test facility.\nAnother NASA and Energy Research and Development Administration project is applying aerospace\nadvances to windmill design. Windmills have provided some electricity\nin many countries for more than half\na century. The current project is\naimed at improving the performance,\noperation, and economics of winddriven electricity generating systems\nfor future commercial use. Construction and test operation of a 100-kilowatt wind generator (windmill) is\nunder the direction of NASA\'s Lewis\nResearch Center.\nSolar cells arrays, which power\nnearly all NASA spacecraft, can con-\n\n38\n\nAt 88 kilometers (55 miles) an hour,\ndevices top and bottom did best in\nreducing air drag on this trucking rig.\n\nvert sunlight directly into electricity,\neven on cloudy days. They are finding\nuse on Earth in remote areas for special tasks where their high cost ($20\nto $50 per watt) is not limiting; for\nexample, automatic weather stations\nand navigational buoys.\nNASA is conducting a program to\nreduce the cost and increase the efficiency of solar cells. It has made\npromising progress in growth of high\nquality single-crystal silicon ribbons\nfor application to mass-produced low\ncost solar cells. The technique can\nreplace the present costly process of\nsawing thin wafers from large cylinders of single-crystal silicon.\nNASA has conducted tests for the\nDepartment of Transportation of addon devices which may reduce air drag\non trucks. Air drag absorbs a significan part of the horsepower of a\nvehicle, particularly at high speeds.\nThe trucks were tested at the NASA\nFlight Research Center. Aerodynamic\ntests with automobiles have been\nconducted by NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory is\ntesting the use of hydrogen in internal\ncombustion engines to save fuel and\nreduce exhaust pollution. Hydrogen\ninjected into the gasoline-air mixture\nmakes it burn at leaner mixtures. In\naddition, gas turbines for automobiles\nare being tested for the Environmental\nProtection Agency at NASA\'s Lewis\nResearch Center.\nWork on Integrated Utility Systems\npoints the way to reductions of more\nthan 40 percent in fuel used for apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, and schools, plus substantial\ndecreases in sewage. Waste heat\n\nfrom electric-power generation is\nused for space and water heating, air\nconditioning, and recycling of liquid\nwaste. In addition, on-site incineration\nof solid waste produces additional\nheat energy while reducing refuse to\nsmall amounts of noncombustible ash.\nThe integrated system is an application in part of technical approaches\nand design philosophies developed\nfrom NASA studies for future large\nspace stations.\nOther energy-related NASA research and development programs\ninvolve energy transmission and\nstorage, energy and environmental\nconservation, and the search for\nenergy resources.\n\nModel of 100-kilowatt windmill to be\ntested in Ohio. Rotor blades span 47.5\nmeters (125 feet) from tip to tip.\n\nRemote weather station atop California\nmountain is powered by solar cell\narrays encapsulated in plastic to\nprotect against harsh weather.\n\nWorking Together\n\nThe preamble to the Act of Congress\ncreating the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration put it plainly:\n"It is the policy of the United States\nthat activities in space should be\ndevoted to peaceful purposes for the\nbenefit of all mankind." In the years\nsince, the agency has hewed to that\nclear line and the far-reaching results\nare so varied they are hard to\nsummarize:\nSatellite systems, growing ever\nmore reliable, speed communications\naround the globe, collect information\nabout the Earth, monitor its weather,\nspot resources of pollution, and help\nfind deposits of fuel. Men have explored the Moon and unmanned\nspacecraft have had closeup looks\nat Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter,\ntelling science more about our near\nneighbors in space than centuries of\nstudy through telescopes shrouded\nby the Earth\'s atmosphere. Aeronautical research has strengthened\nAmerican leadership in aviation.\nTechnology resulting from these\nefforts has contributed to electronics,\nmedicine, agriculture, indeed to\nnearly every human endeavor. By\nsharing that technology and ourscientific discoveries with the world, as\nwell as helping other countries explore space, the United States has\nfostered international goodwill and\ncooperation.\nIt all began in 1958 with passage of\nPublic Law 85-568, the National Aeronautics and Space Act, on July 29.\nNASA actually took form on October\n1,1958, by absorbing the 43-year-old\nNational Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics (NACA), which besides a\nheadquarters in Washington had five\nfield centers: Ames Aeronautical\n\nLaboratory (now Ames Research Center), Mountain View, California; High\nSpeed Flight Station (now Flight Research Center), Edwards, California;\nLangley Aeronautical Laboratory (now\nLangley Research Center), Hampton,\nVirginia; Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (now Lewis Research Center),\nCleveland, Ohio; and the Pilotless Aircraft Research Center (now Wallops\nFlight Center), Wallops Island, Virginia. Also acquired was the Navy\'s\nProject Vanguard.\nNASA then assumed direction of\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology,\nPasadena, California, and took over\nthe Development Operations Division\nof the Army Ballistics Missile Agency,\nwhich became the George C. Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, Huntsville,\nAlabama, and the Army Ballistics\nMissile Agency launch operations at\nCape Canaveral, Florida, which was\ndeveloped into the John F. Kennedy\nSpace Center.\nLater on, NASA established Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,\nMaryland; Manned Spacecraft Center\n(now Lyndon B. Johnson Space\nCenter), Houston, Texas; and the\nMississippi Test Facility (now National\nSpace Technology Laboratories), Bay\nSt. Louis, Mississippi. The Electronics\nResearch Center at Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, which NASA founded,\nhas been shifted to the Department of\nTransportation.\nThe agency employs nearly 25,000\npersons who work with industry, educational institutions, and other government agencies both in the United\nStates and abroad on its assigned\ntasks in aerospace science and\ntechnology.\nU.S. Government Printing Office:\n19750-591-692\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2-\n\nFor sale by the Superintendent of Documents\nU.S. Government Printing Office\nWashington, D.C. 20402\nPrice $2\nStock Number 033-000-00631 -4\n\nAppropriations By Fiscal Years\nBillions of Dollars\n\n3.749\n3-313\n\n3.310\n\n3.408\n3.040\'\n\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\nFiscal Years\nIncludes $37.6 million supplement\n\nTotal Employment On NASA Programs\nManpower\n200,000\n\n150,000\n\n100,000\n\n50,000\n\nJune\n1970\n\nJune\n1971\n\nJune\n1972\n\nJune\n1973\n\nJune\n1974\n\nPersonnel Summary On Board at End ot Fiscal Year*\n\nFinancial Summary (In Millions of Dollars)\nFiscal\nYear\n1959\n1960\n1961\n1962\n1963\n1964\n1965\n1966\n1967\n1968\n1969\n1970\n1971\n1972\n1973\n1974\n\nTotal\nAppropriations\n\nTotal\nObligations\n\nTotal\nOutlays\n\n330.9\n523.6\n966.7\n1,825.3\n3,674.1\n5,100.0\n5,250.0\n5,175.0\n4,968.0\n4,588.9\n3,995.3\n3,749.2\n3,312.6\n3,310.1\n3,407.7\n3,039.7\n\n298.7\n486.9\n908.3\n1,691.7\n3,448.4\n4,864.8\n5,500.7\n5,350.5\n5,011.7\n4,520.4\n4,045.2\n3,858.9\n3,324.0\n3,228.6\n3,154.0\n3,122.4\n\n145.5\n401.0\n744.3\n1,257.0\n2,552.4\n4,171.0\n5,092.9\n5,933.0\n5,425.7\n4,723.7\n4,251.7\n3,753.1\n3,381.9\n3,422.9\n3,315.2\n3,256.2\n\nInstallation\n\nFY1974\n\nNASA Headquarters\nAmes Research Center\nElectronics Research Center\nFlight Research Center\nGoddard Space Flight Center\nKennedy Space Center\nLangley Research Center\nLewis Research Center\nJohnson Space Center\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nSpace Nuclear Systems Office\nNASA Pasadena Office\nWallops Flight Center\nNASA Total\na\nb\n\nFY1973\n\nFY 1972\n\nFY1971\n\nFY1970\n\n1,734\n1,776\n\xe2\x80\x94\n531\n3,936\n2,408\n3,504\n3,172\n3,886\n4,575\n\xe2\x80\x94\n39\n447\n\n1,747\n1,740\n\xe2\x80\x94\n509\n3,852\n2,516\n3,389\n3,368\n3,896\n5,287\n\xe2\x80\x94\n39\n434\n\n1,755\n1,844\n\n1,895\n1,968\n\n2.187\n2.033\n\n45\n40\n465\n\n579\n4,459\n2,704\n3,830\n4,083\n4,298\n6,060\n89\n44\n497\n\n583\n4,487\n2,895\n3,970\n4,240\n4,539\n6,325\n103\n72\n522\n\n28,382\n\n30,506\n\n32,548\n\n26,007\n\n26,777\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n539\n\n4,178\n2,568\n3,592\n3,866\n3,935\n5,555\n\nIncludes both permanent and temporary employees.\nERC was closed effective midnight June 30, 1970.\n\nNASA Field Installations\nMarshall Space\nFlight Center\n\nAmes Research\nCenter\nr-r u* n\nt.\nMight Hesearcn\nCenter\nJet Propulsion "\'\nLaboratory\nJohnson Space ~~~~\nCenter\n\nLewis Research\nCenter\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2s.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n.^^\n^^^\n^^-~--.\xe2\x80\x94 -^\n\nNational Space\nTechnology Laboratories\n\nv\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Goddard Space\nFlight Center\nx\n\nWallops Flight\nCenter\nLangley Research\nV\n\\\nCenter\nKennedy Space\nCenter\n\\\\\n\nv\n\\\n\nNASA\n\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\nEP117\n\nProduced by the\nOffice of Public Affairs\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\nWashington, D.C.\n\n'
