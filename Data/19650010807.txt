In assembling the\nfirst edition of this work, the writer was ably assisted by Mrs. Elizabeth\nBoardman, Librarian of the Geophysical and Polar Research Center at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin. Her untiring efforts and active interest in this\nproject were of great value. With that strong foundation, the task of revising the work was lessened considerably.\nRapid recent progress in the study of microscopic extraterrestrial\nparticles necessitated a complete revision of the 1963 survey. In many\nplaces, new data afford better understanding of problems encountered in the\nearlier work, Moreover, the new results suggest areas for further study to\nanswer questions they raise about the nature and origin of the particles.\nMany people contributed to this task, and their assistance is gratefully\nacknowledged. Rough drafts of the text were reviewed by many investigators\nworking on the same general topic. Their many comments, criticisms, and\nsuggestions were of great value in preparing the final draft, although the\nresponsibility for fts contents is the writer\'s.\n\niii\n\ncomms\nPage\n\n..............................\n.\n.\n.\n..............................\n.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . -. . . . . . . . . . .\n.\n..\n.\n..........................\n..\n..\n..\n..\n. .,. . . . .\n. . ...\n.\n. .. .............. .... . .\n...............\n.......................\n.\n.......... ................\n. .\n. .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ....\n...........\n..........................\n..............\n.\n.\n.........................\n.\n.....\n.\n...........................\n.......... ..........\n....\n...................\n.............................\n\niii\nPREFACE..\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nDEFINITIONS\n2\nCosmicDust e .\n2\nMeteoriticDust\n3\nMicrometeorite\n4\nMeteoricDust\n4\nInterplanetary Dust\n5\nSumnary of Preferred Terminology\n5\nDESCRIPTION OF PARTICLES\n6\nSIZE\n7\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES\n8\nCHEMICALCOMPOSITION\n8\nOCCURRENCE\n9\nANNUAL DEPOSIT\n1\n2\nTHEORIES OF ORIGIN\n15\nAPPENDIX - Chronological Rdsume\' of Previous Work on Microscopic Extrater19\nrestrial Particles (Since 1945)\nTABLE I - Classifications of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particles\n.\n67\nTABLE 11.- Comprehensive Classification of Microscopic Extraterrestrial\n69\nParticles\nTABLE 111.- Size of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particles\n7\n0\nTABLE 1V.- Physical Properties of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particles 72\nTABLE V.- Chemical Analyses of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particles\n74\nTABLE VI.- Estimates of the Concentration of Interplanetary Dust in Outer\nSpace\n76\nTABLE VI1.- Estimates of the Annual Deposits of Microscopic Extrater77\nrestrial Particles\nTABLE VII1.- Sources of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particles\n79\nTABLE 1X.- Locations of Microscopic Extraterrestrial Particle Collections\non the Earth\'s Surface\n8\n0\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n8\n6\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\ne\n\n.\n\nFIGURES................................\n\nV\n\n119\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMicroscopic particles are the least understood of all materials that\nreach the Earth from outer space. Indeed, for much of the time since their\ndiscovery about a century ago, they were regarded merely as geological curiosities. Although usually mentioned in Earth science textbooks as an exdtic\nsource of material for oceanic sedimentation, little was known about the\nnature of the particles, their origin, or how they came to be deposited at\nthe Earth\'s surface. The small size of the particles and the difficulty in\nobtaining samples free from terrestrial contaminants thwarted many early\nattempts to unlock their mysteries, and few data were available until\nrecently\n\n.\n\nSpace exploration provided the impetus for renewed efforts to determine\nthe composition, characteristics, occurrence, and origin of microscopic extraterrestrial particles, because they occupy a position of critical importance\nto better understanding the space environment of our planet. These data are\nessential to comprehensive planning of space research, and especially to the\ndesign and construction of successful, manned space vehicles. Problems of\nobtaining quantitative data for such particles are no longer severe because\nof advances in instrumentation. Furthermore, modern efforts to study the\nparticles are commonly coordinated and complementary, unlike many conducted\nin the past. To evaluate the present research properly, however, knowledge\nof previous studies is essential.\n\nA survey of data on microscopic extraterrestrial particles was undertaken to provide an up-to-date compilation of existing information on the\nsubject as a reference for new research in progress at Ames Research Center.\nThe present survey is a revision of an earlier version (Schmidt, Jan. 1963)~\nwhich has been expanded to include most recent studies. The objective of the\nsurvey is to bring together as much available data as possible. Principal\nattention was devoted to the following categories: particle description,\nsize, physical properties, chemical composition, occurrence, location of\nsamples, annual deposit, space concentration, and theories of origin.\nMany sources of information were employed in this effort; all are listed\nin alphabetical order in the bibliography. A few works, however, were relied\nupon more extensively and deserve special mention. The studies of Buddhue\nfrom 1940 to 1948 produced a classic paper on "meteoritic dust," published in\n1930. This research, an important contribution in its own right, served to\narouse new interest in the study of such particles, which had been virtually\nneglected since the time of Murray (1883). Shortly after Buddhue\'s monograph\nwas published, several. more reports of studies of dust particles appeared.\nAnother valuable source of articles on "cosmic dust" and "interplanetary dust"\nwas the annotated bibliography of Hoffleit (1932) expanded by Hodge, Wright,\nand Hoffleit (1961). Still other papers were located through bibliographies\ncompiled by Magnolia (1962, 1963, 1 6 )\n9 4 . Finally, the bibliographies of\nSalisbury and Salisbury ( $ ) Salisbury, Van Tassel, and Adler ( $ )\n11,\n1 2 , and\nSalisbury, Van Tassel, Adler, and Dodd (1963) were also of considerable\nvalue. It is no exaggeration to say that without such useful and current\n\n,\n\n1\n\nbibliographical aids, a survey of the present type would be infinitely more\ndifficult. The authors of these works are performing a real service to those\nstudying interplanetary matter. The remainder of the data summarized here\nwas taken from works referenced by several authors and from the current\nliterature.\nMany investigators have studied the occurrence and characteristics of\nmicroscopic extraterrestrial particles. Short descriptions of works completed prior to 1950 were presented in chronological order by Budahue (1950).\nThis novel and interesting practice provided valuable insight into the\ndevelopment of the science of particle study. Available works completed\nsince then were briefly summarized, in the same manner, in the appendix to\nallow this presentation to be employed as an extension of Buddhue\'s review\nto the present day.\nDEFINITIONS\nThe material treated in this survey is known by many names, among which\nare cosmic dust, cosmic spherules, caudaites, meteoritic dust, meteoric dust,\nmicrometeorites, nanometeorites, interplanetary dust, interstellar dust,\nprimordial dust, zodiacal dust, galactic dust, cometary debris, planetary\ndebris, and asteroidal fragments. It is clear that these diverse terms,\noften used by different workers to describe the same matter, can be confusing.\nIn an attempt to reduce such confusion, definitions of each are presented\nbelow. The first four subsections describe materials collected at the surface of the Earth. In the strictest sence, these classes of particles are\nmeteorites because of their occurrence. However, the particles have in the\npast been designated by different terms to provide insight into their origin,\nand this practice is adopted here. The fifth subsection considers particles\noccurring in space, and the final subsection presents a summary of preferred\nterminology.\nCosmic Dust\nThe term was coined by Murray (1883) to denote all classes of extraterrestrial particles discovered in ocean sediments sampled during the E\nChallenger expedition. Cosmic dust included metallic spherules as well as\n0\nsiliceous particles. All particles, which ranged in size from about 1 microns to 250 microns, occurred in both recent and ancient sediments located\nin the deep ocean basin, far from land and from possible sources of industrial contamination (which might well have been a much less serious problem\nat that time than at present). Furthermore, Murray and Renard (1883, p. 490)\nnoted that the form and character of the spherules were "essentially different" from those collected near manufacturing centers. The metallic particles\n(also known as cosmic spherules) were black, and were coated with a magnetic\niron oxide covering an inner portion which gave positive chemical tests for\nmetallic iron, cobalt, and nickel. These elements are rather rare in\n2\n\nterrestrial materials, but are common to meteorites. Therefore, Murray and\nRenard (1883) postulated an extraterrestrial or cosmic origin for such particles. They suggested that the dust particles represented fragments of\nmeteorites which disintegrated upon entering the Earth\'s atmosphere. Unfortunately, Buddhue\'s definition of meteoritic dust (see below) is identical to this usage of cosmic dust, and these apparent synonyms have been used\nindisciminately by many workers. The writer finds this practice confusing,\nparticularly because reference to original usage of the terms is commonly\nomitted. Brunn, et al. (1955) proposed to call such particles caudaites to\ndistinguish them from other cosmic bodies, but this term did not gain\nacceptance.\nRecently, Krinov (1961) suggested that the term cosmic dust be\nrestricted to those particles sufficiently small to settle on the Earth\'s\nsurface without undergoing melting by atmospheric friction. The particles\nwould thus be essentially unchanged fromtheir form in space, and could be\nconsidered as samples of interplanetary dust (see below). To accomplish\nunaltered entry into the atmosphere, iron particles must be less than 5 mic0\nrons diameter, while glassy particles must be smaller than 1 microns diameter. Krinov\'s definition of cosmic dust clearly departs from Murray\'s\noriginal usage of the term, and is identical with Whipple\'s usage of "micrometeorite" (see below).\nOver the years Murray\'s use of cosmic dust was not followed with care by\nsubsequent workers. The result was that, while many papers referred to cosmic dust, entirely different material was often described. It is therefore\nproper at the present to redefine cosmic dust to conform to modern usage.\nThe writer prefers Krinov\'s definition of cosmic dust, limiting this term to\nthe smaller particles encountered by the Earth. In a clear, descriptive\nmanner, it summarizes the nature of the smaller particles and presents what\ncan be inferred about their origin.\n.1\nThe smallest particles yet recovered (about 0 0 micron diameter) were\ndesignated nanometeorites by Hemenway, et al. (1961). The writer regards\nthese particles as a type of cosmic dust, although so little is known about\nthem that future work may require revision of this categorization.\n\nMeteoritic Dust\nThis term was employed by Buddhue (1950) to describe spherical particles\ncomposed of both metal and glass, cindery fragments, and angular grains. It\nimplied that such material originated from disintegration and/or partial\nfusion of meteoroids during their passage through the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nThe similarity of this definition of meteoritic dust with Murray\'s usage of\ncosmic dust is apparent. However, the writer does not favor use of two names\nfor the same material.\n\n3\n\nKrinov (1959) suggested that meteoritic dust be redefined as the globules and angular, deformed, particula5e matter which occurs at the sites of\nlarger meteoritic falls, This definition is preferred by the writer.\nMicrometeorite\nThis term was coined by Whipple (1949) to describe very small meteoroids\nwhich radiate energy fast enough that upon entering the Earth\'s atmosphere\nthey do not reach their melting point. Micrometeorites would be iron parti0\ncles less than 5 microns diameter and stony particles less than 1 microns\ndiameter, which could survive entry into the atmosphere at vertical incidence\nvelocities (Whipple, 1950, 1951). It may be presumed that larger particles\ncould survive atmospheric entry at lower velocities and/or angles of\nincidence.\n\n,\n\nUnfortunately, micrometeorite was used by Vedder (1961) among others,\nto denote solid particles encountered by space vehicles. Newspaper accounts\nof space research are particularly guilty of this improper usage, which\nbecame popular in spite of the fact that material must reach the Earth in\norder to be considered a meteorite. As Goettleman, et al. (1961) pointed\nout, the term %icrometeoroid" should be used instead to describe particles\nfound in space. In connection with that incorrect usage of Whipple\'s term,\ncurrent practice by many workers expanded it to include all sorts of microscopic extraterrestrial particles, not just the smallest as Whipple intended,\nEngineering considerations of spacecraft design led to still other usages,\nsuch as that of Bradford and Dycus (1964), in which micrometeorite was\ngm. It is regrettable that\ndefined as a particle with mass less than\nthe original definition of micrometeorite should have become so clouded in\nsuch a short time. However, because of this confusion, the writer prefers\nthe term cosmic dust for such small particles, as discussed above.\nIn an attempt to conform to present usage, Krinov (1959) suggested that\nmicrometeorite be restricted to small particles having the basic properties\nof meteorites (i.e., fusion crust, flow marks, e c )\nt..\nTo possess these\n0\nfeatures the particles must necessarily be larger than about 1 microns in\ndiameter. The writer recommends that this definition be adopted; it is precisely implied by the components of the term.\nMeteoric Dust\nKrinov (1959) coined this term to denote material resulting from melting\nof a cometary meteor in the earth\'s atmosphere. Some of the particles resulting fromthis process are spheriodal, while others are irrgular flakes. They\nhave an entirely different chemical and mineralogical composition from the\nbodies that produced them because of oxidation during flight. Meteors are\nquite distinct from meteorites, and apparently have had a different origin\n(Mason, 1962).\n\n4\n\nThe writer has encountered this term rarely in his literature survey.\nIt is a relatively new one, which may account for its limited adoption. A\nprimary reason for its infrequent use may be the difficulty in recognizing\nthe source of particles, so critical to the definition of this term. The\nparent material of meteors apparently disintegrates in the atmosphere and is\neither lost or extremely difficult to distinguish-from meteorites. Still,\nthe writer regards meteoric dust as a useful term, and recommends its adoption. Perhaps the metallic flakes with amorphous (organic?) attachments that\nParkin, et al. (1962)recovered are meteoric dust; they appear to be associ9 2 . It is diffiated with principal meteor showers (Parkin and Hunter, 1 6 )\ncult, however, to understand how such large flakes (often several hundred\nmicrons long) could have escaped melting during entry into the atmosphere.\nDesignation of these materials as extraterrestrial in origin should be\ndeferred until conclusive proof is obtained.\n\n-\n\nInterplanetary Dust\n\nSolid particles of microscopic size occurring in space outside of planetary or solar atmospheres are known by many names. Recent efforts in space\nresearch have contributed to this proliferation of terms. The occurrence of\nsuch material in space is suggested by the names interstellar dust (Herzberg,\n1954); interplanetary dust (Minneart, 1954); galatic dust (Inglis, 1961);\nrimordial dust (opik, 1954); zodiacal dust (Kallman, 1954) and zodiacal\n;\narticles Whipple, 1954). What can be inferred about the origin of the\nparticles is indicated by the terms cometary debris, planetary debris,\nasteroidal fragments, and micrometeoroids.\n\nProbably, particles frommanysources comprise the interplanetary dust\ncloud, but present knowledge of solid particles occurring in space is fragmentary and incomplete. The writer prefers a descriptive term, one which\ninforms the reader of particle character and occurrence, but which does not\nimpose an assumption about particle origin, and recommends that interplanetary dust be adopted for this purpose.\nSummary of Preferred Terminology\nThe writer prefers the following terms to denote microscopic extraterrestrial particles which occur at the surface of the Earth or in the Earth\'s\natmosphere.\nCosmic dust: microscopic particles small enough to settle on the\nEarth\'s surface without undergoing melting by atmospheric friction (less\nthan about 1 microns diameter for particles at vertical incidence\n0\nvelocities).\nMeteoritic dust: microscopic particles which occur at the sites of\nlarger meteorite falls.\n\n5\n\nMicrometeorite: microscopic particles having the basic properties\nof meteorites, including fusion crusts and flow markings, but which do\nnot occur at places of larger meteorite falls.\nMeteoric dust: microscopic particles resulting from evaporation\nand/or disintegration of a cometary meteor in-the Earth\'s atmosphere or\nin the vicinity of the Earth.\nThe writer prefers the term interplan-%tag _ dust to denote microscopic\nparticles occurring in space outside the practical limits of the Earth\'s\natmosphere.\nDESCRIPTION OF PARTICLES\nIdentification of microscopic extraterrestrial particles is a difficult\ntask, principally because some terrestrial geological processes and industrial activities can produce material generally similar in appearance. V o l canic eruptions, such as that of Krakatoa in 1883, spewed large amounts of\ndust and ash into the Earth\'s atmosphere. Fredriksson and Martin (1963)\nshowed that some volcanic particles were similar in appearance to those of\nextraterrestrial origin, differing primarily in chemical composition and\nexpecially in nickel content. Hodge and Wright (1964) reported that particles of volcanic origir. were compositionally distinct from those thought to\nbe of extraterrestrial origin. They found, moreover, that volcanic particles\nrarely occurred as spheroids, unlike the extraterrestrial material which\ncommonly were spherules. Industrial particles may also be confused with\nthose from space. Handy and Davidson (1953) showed that the particles\nThomsen (1953) recovered from Iowa snows and believed to be of meteoritic\norigin were probably from a nearby manufacturing center. It is apparent that\ncontamination hazards must be considered in each collection of extraterrestrial particles in order to obtain meaningful results. Unfortunately, precautions employed to eliminate or control contamination have not been\nstandard throughout the history of this work. The reader is urged to keep\nthis in mind as he considers the following review of particle descriptions.\nMicroscopic extraterrestrial particles are represented by several different types, as.recognized in previous studies. These are described in\ntable I, which contains eight different classifications of such material\ntaken from the literature. The table shows that most of the particles are\nspherical in shape, and that their most common constituents are metallic\n(iron and nickel) and glassy ( siliceous). The predominance of spherical\nparticles in these classifications is striking, expecially among the varied\nmaterial of Buddhue\'s (1950) listing. It is reas Inable to suspect that the\ncause of this superabundance of spherical particles is their ease of recognition. A smooth, spherical grain is conspicuous in any assemblage of normal,\nsubangular to subrounded rock fragments, and can be readily distinguished\nas distinctly different from its neighbors. Moreover, terrestrial geological\nprocesses so rarely produce spherical forms that an extraterrestrial origin\nfor such particles is a real possibility. Recognition of nonspherical\n6\n\nI\n\nextraterrestrial particles in juxtaposition with terrestrial rock fra.gments\nis many times moredifficult, and it is likely that this accounts for the\npaucity of data for them. In fact, Murray\'s original classification was\nlimited entirely to spherical particles, as were more recent ones by Skolnick\n(1961) and Utech (1962). Examples of particles generally assumed to be of\nextraterrestrial origin are shown in figures 1 and 2\n.\nThe several classifications of microscopic extraterrestrial particles,\neach useful separately in their present forms were employed in the construction of a comprehensive classification of such particles. This is shown in\ntable 1 . It was thought that in this way the present investigation could\n1\nmost effectively benefit from the knowledge attained by the previous workers.\nThe aggregate classification is viewed as a working model, which will probably\nrequire revision during present research.\nThe writer classifies most of this material as micrometeorites. The\nmajority of particles are too large to be cosmic dust. Most samples are from\nlocalities far removed from known meteorite falls or were collected from air\nand not related to meteorite passage, therefore, not satisfying the preferred\ndefinition of meteoritic dust. The few coated particles may be samples of\nmeteoric dust.\nExcept where specifically noted, however, all material in\nthe comprehensive classification given in table I1 is regarded as a type of\nmicrometeorite.\n\nSIZE\nThe sizes of known microscopic extraterrestrial partides vary over a\nconsiderable range. The smallest (cosmic dust) particles collected are\n0 0 micron in diameter (Hemenway, 1961), while the largest (micrometeorites)\n.1\nare 850 microns in diameter (Skolnick, 1961). These are the extremes of\nparticle sizes investigated. Most particles, however, are less than 250 microns in diameter, and the most frequently occurring sizes are in the narrow\nrange from 1 micron to 60 microns in diameter. A listing of size determinations is presented in table 111.\nGraphical representations of size distributions and abundances of\nparticles are shown in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 is a compilation of data\nfrom eight surface-based studies of micrometeorites (metallic spherules).\nWhile it is apparent that not every investigation of metallic spherules considered particles in the same size group, the particle size distribution\nfound in these studies was of similar character. Each investigator found\nthat the bulk of his sample consisted of smaller particles, with larger\nparticles occuring rarely. This appears to be in general agreement with the\ntheoretical relation proposed by Laevastu and Mellis (1961), which is\n\nwhere V is the volume or mass of a single spherule in a given size group or\ndiameter interval; and N is the number of spherules in this size group.\n\n7\n\nIt is interesting to note the similarity in abundances of particles\nresulting from studies in the same size range. Hodge and Wildt (1938),\n16)\nHodge ( 9 0 , and Crozier (1960) found similar values for particles from 3 to\nabout 30 microns in diameter. Buddhue (19>0),Laevastu and Mellis (1955),\nHunter and Parkin (1960), Thiel and Schmidt (1961), Langway (1963), Mutch\n(1963), and Schmidt (1963) found similar abundance6 for particles from 1 to\n0\nabout 2 0 microns in diameter. Slight disagreements between these studies\n0\nwill probably be resolved by current research.\nFigure 4 shows a compilation of size distributions for glassy particles,\ncompiled from three surface-based studies. In general, abundances of glassy\nparticles are similar to those of metallic spherules, but the data are too\nlimited to permit further comparisons at this time. Parkin and Hunter (1962)\nfound two size groups for "stony" spherules. The smaller particles, less\nthan 60 microns in diameter, were thought to be derived from the breakup of\nlarger spherules due to aerodynamic forces. Whether a similar explanation\ncan be applied to small, metallic spherules remains to be demonstrated.\nPHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nThe small size of microscopic extraterrestrial particles has made\ndeterminations of their physical properties quite difficult. What little is\nknow or inferred about these properties is summarized in table IV. These\ndata present only a general idea of the physical character of micrometeorites.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to compare values obtained by different workers,\nfor often the methods used and error limits of the values obtained were not\nreported. The data suggest, however, that the density and refractive indices\nof the glassy particles place them in the realm of rock-forming minerals and\nmeteorites. The metallic spherules are most similar to metallic meteorites.\nGlassy particles appear similar to natural silica-rich glasses and may be\nakin to tektites.\n\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION\nRelatively few chemical analyses of microscopic extraterrestrial particles have been performed. It is likely that the small size of the particles\nhindered progress in this direction. However, even in the earliest studies,\nbulk gravitational chemical analyses of particle aggregates were reported\nwhich indicated a similarity of particles to meteoritic matter. Many qualitatzve analyses were done as a part of earlier works, and still are performed\ntoday (Grjebine, Lalou, Ros, and Capitant, 1963). It is difficult to see\nany advantage in further qualitative analyses as compared to reliable, quantitative data in providing information necessary to resolve questions of particle origin. With the development of the electron microprobe, it became\npossible to obtain quantitative analyses of individual particles. Care must\nbe exercised in this work, however. Data of analyses of particle surfaces\nwere reported by Riggs, Wright, and Hodge (1962); Wright, Hodge, and Langway\n\n8\n\n(1963) Langway (1963) Langway and Marvin (1963) Schmidt (1963) Hodge and\n;\n;\n;\n;\nWright (1964); and Hodge, Wright, and Langway (1964). More than 1200 particles were examined in this way, but only fewhave surface compositions indicative of meteoritic materials, including samples from known meteorite falls\nsuch as Meteor Crater, Arizona and Sikhote-Alin, USSR. An explanation for\nt\'nese curious results was offered through a study by Schmidt and Keil (1964).\nParticles were examined in cross section (fig. ?), revealing a terrestrial\nalteration zone at the surface which often masked a variable internal texture\nand meteoritic composition. Consequently, the surface analyses could not be\nrepresentative of entire particles. It is unfortunate that the surface\nanalyses which exist are of limited value, although some problems of interpretation of those data are now alleviated. A sampling of available analyses\nis presented in table V.\n0CCUFXE"E\nLocations where microscopic extraterrestrial particles were collected on\nthe Earth are listed in the appendix and are shown in figure 6. It can be\nseen that they were recovered from positions which differ widely in latitude\nand longitude. In fact, particles were found literally around the world and\nalmost from pole to pole. Therefore, many workers assumed that the particles\nfell uniformly over the surface of the Earth. This assumption may require\nreview, but existing information is insufficient for a critical evaluation.\nSites from which particles were obtained are badly scattered over great distances. Few data are available on the character of particle occurrence over\na regional area. A first attempt to define particle occurrence on a regional\nbasis was made for the Antarctic Peninsula Traverse area by Schmidt (1963).\nThat work showed a strong meteorological effect upon particle occurrence,\nwith a direct relation between frequency of particle occurrence and annual\nIt was postulated that particles were swept out\nsnow accumulation (fig. \'[).\nof the atmosphere by the falling snow. However, no correlations of particle\noccurrence in snow layers representing the same year at different stations\nwere observed. Surface winds produced rapid changes in snow surface which\nmade correlation impossible. As a result, Marshall\'s (1959, 1963) suggestion\nthat particulate matter can be used as a quantitative stratigraphic parameter\nf o r correlation of glaciological measurements over broad areas of polar ice\ncaps appears to be a forlorn hope.\nRelationships of extraterrestrial particles to precipitation were also\nproposed by Bowen (1956), in a hypothesis which he was later to describe\nwryly as "well-known but widely ignored." Noting that periods of heavy\nrainfall occurred about 30 days after principal meteor swarms, he suggested\nthat the particles required this amount of time to fall through the atmosphere to the level where they could influence precipitation by acting as\ncondensation nuclei for moisture. This view was challenged by many workers.\nOne of these was Fletcher (1961) who pointed out that meteoric particles\nhave low activity as condensation nuclei and would be insufficient to make\nBowen\'s mechanism operate. Another objection was the length of time of particle fall through the atmosphere. Collections of Parkin and Hunter (1962)\n\n9\n\nsuggested that meteoric particles fell through the atmosphere in a few days,\nnot the month which Bowen required. Calculations by Thiel and Schmidt (1961)\nsupported that view, although an idealized case was considered.\nBowen (1963) recently modified his hypothesis to include an apparent\nrelationship of rainfall, freezing nuclei, and meteor showers with lunar\nphase. Brierley and Davies (1963) concurred in that view, although Ellyett\nand Keay (1964) reported that the existence of any lunar influence on meteor\nrate data was doubtful.\nSupport for Bowen\'s view was found by Rcsinski and Pierrard (1964) in a\nstudy of noctilucent clouds, tenuous clouds observed at twilight in summer at\nhigh latitudes. It was suggested that condensation of moisture on meteoric\nparticles were responsible for the clouds. Collections of particles from\nnoctilucent clouds by Soberman, et al. (1963) were consistent with this view,\nas Fe and Ni particles with ice coatings were recovered.\nWhether or not Bowen\'s hypothesis is proved correct, it served a real\npurpose in forcing students of micrometeorites and cosmic dust to take atmospheric and meteorlogical effects into account. The theoretical treatments of\ndeceleration of particles upon atmospheric entry formulated by Gazely (1957)\n0\ncan be used to show that most particles less than 1 microns in diameter\nreach paximum deceleration at altitudes of the order of 1 0 to 200 km.\n0\nLarge particles are decelerated at slightly deeper levels in the atmosphere,\nso that an effective filtration of particles by size (and probably strength)\noccurs. Fiocco and Colombo (1964) described radar meteor observations which\n1\nsupport this view. A radar scattering layer found between 1 0 and 140 km\naltitude w a s attributed to fragmentation of meteoric particles. Progressive\nfragmentation in the atmosphere was postulated, so that the average size of\nparticles and mass flux would vary with altitude.\nFrom the altitude of maximum deceleration, particles fall to Earth at\nterminal velocity under the Earth\'s gravitational field, In this condition\nof fall the particles are subject to meteorological influences which may be\nexpected to affect the occurrence of particles at the surface of the Earth.\nIt would be valuable to achieve an understanding of particle influx if future\ncollections of particles could be directed at obtaining representation of\nparticle occurrence over regional areas.\nOn the basis of astronomical observations, the presence of solid particles in interplanetary space was suspected for some time. Many studies of\nthe character of solar light suggested that bands of "obscuring matter" or\ndust particles may occur in scattered localities throughout our galaxy.\nLight absorption studies showed that interplanetary dust is indeed present\nin space, and that it tends to be concentrated in the plane defined by the\nSun and the orbits of the planets. The reflection of sunlight from such\nparticles was postulated as the cause of the zodiacal light, hence the name\nzodiacal dust was applied to these particles.\nRecently, rocket and satellite observations suggested that interplanetary dust occurs in rather high concentrations in the space near the Earth.\n\n1\n0\n\nBeard (1959, 1963) noted that interplanetary dust is distributed in space as\nthe inverse three-halves power of its distance from the Sun. He further\nstated that all particles in the vicinity of the Earth will have their orbits\nmaterially affected by the Earth\'s gravitational field, forming a dust\nblanket around the Earth. The particle concentration in the dust blanket was\nestimated to be lo3 times greater than the deep space value. A similar gravitational mechanism was proposed by Kaiser (1963), but it was extended to\naccount for particle deposition on the Earth. Gravitationally concentrated\nparticles near the Earth were thought to eventually encounter the Earth\'s\natmosphere where they would be decelerated as described above and deposited.\nDole (1962) suggested that gravitational concentration of low-velocity particles could maintain a steady-state dust cloud near the Earth. This view was\nchallenged by Southworth (1963), who showed that Dole \' mechanism would, by\ns\nitself, be a negligible contribution to the Earth\'s dust cloud.\nWhipple (1961), while agreeing that a high concentration of interplanetary dust OCCUTS near the Earth, suggested that the concentration falls off\n.\nroughly as the inverse 1 4 power of the distance from the Earth\'s surface to\na distance of approximately 1 0 0 0 km. Dole \'s (1962) calculations suggested\n0,0\nthat concentration decreases as the inverse 1 6 power of the distance from\n.6\nEarth.\nGoettleman,et - (1961) apparently held a view similar to Whipple\'s.\n- al.\nThey postulated the existence of a meteoroid halo or belt of relatively high,\nconstant particle density surrounding the Earth, but extending only to an\naltitude about 4000 km above its surface. Beyond that level they envisioned\na region of lower particle density.\nAnother view is held by Singer (1961), who proposed that there is a\nmaximum in dust concentration at about 2000 to 3 0 km above the Earth\'s sur00\nface, giving rise to a dust shell. Mirtov (1962) also postulated a dust\nshell, but placed the maximum at only 100-200 km above the Earth\'s surface.\nThe increase was thought to amount to only a few times the value of the dust\nconcentration in interplanetary space, rather than the factor of 1 0 given\n00\nby Beard (1959).\nThe work of McCracken, Alexander, and Dubin (1961) does not support the\ndust cloud or dust shell interpretations cited above. They maintained that\nthere is no discernible dependence of the spatial density of dust particles\non altitude. Further, they stated that if a high concentration of dust particles exist, measurements of dust concentrations at very large distances\nfrom the Earth would be necessary to confirm its presence. In other words,\nthey maintained that the limited data currently available do not permit\nrecognition of a dust cloud or dust shell around the Earth.\nRecently, however, Alexander (1962) reported measurements of interplanetary dust conducted by the Mariner I1 space probe. These indicated that lo4\ntimes fewer particles were encountered in space between Earth and Venus than\nwere detected by satellites nearer the Earth. The preliminary data thus\nsuggested that there is a concentration of interplanetary dust near the\nvicinity of Earth. Its exact character is still ~uLkn0w-n.\n1\n1\n\nIngham (1963) suggested that the ,gegenschein (counter glow), a diffuse\nlight observed on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun, was produced\nby reflection of sunlight from particles in the Earth\'s dust cloud. Work by\nDycus, - - (1964) is consistent with this suggestion; a concentration of\net al.\npenetration - size dust particles was computed to occur in this region (fig.8).\n\nA compilation of several estimates of the concentration of interplanetary\ndust in space is given in table VI, The table shows that most workers consider interplanetary dust to be present in space in concentrations ranging\nfrom\ngm/cm3 to\ngm/cm3. Fewer values are available for the concentration of particles in space near the Earth, and these are in less close\nagreement, ranging from 10-\'~gm/cm~ to\ngm/cm3. A representation of\nnear Earth and space concentration of particulate matter presented by\nD\'Aiutolo (1963) is shown in figure 9.\nAIKNUfi DEPOSIT\n\nMicroscopic extraterrestrial particles were collected from.sediments\n(including ice) and from rocks of many different geological ages. It would\nappear that virtually the entire Earth received deposits of such material\nfrom the present day back through geological time to the Precambrian era,\nmore than 500 million years ago (Mutch, 1964, personal communication). It\nmay be suspected that particle deposits occurred even earlier in the Earth\'s\nhistory. Possible, but yet to be proved, is the suggestion that dust particles similar to those observed today played some role in the origin of the\nEarth through accretion of dust particles.\nMany terrestrial studies of the rate of spherule deposition were conducted. Each estimate, however, is subject to errors in extrapolation of\nparticle occurrence over a small area to the surface of the Earth, assuming\nuniform deposition. Furthermore, the assumed uniformity of particle distribution remains to be demonstrated. The reader is cautioned to keep these\nfacts in mind as he considers the data of particle deposit.\nKnowledge of the amounts of sediment and snow which are deposited in 1\nyear, together with determinations of mass of particles occurring in annual\nlayers, were used by previous workers in estimating the annual deposit of\nparticles on the Earth. Most data are available for black, magnetic spherules, and only these will be considered. Resulting estimates, listed in\ntable VI1 vary widely, from 8 metric tons per year (Buddhue, 1950) to\n2.4XLO9 metric tons per year (Grjebine, 1963). Part of this enormous disparity in values may be traced to the fact that not all estimates were based\non studies of the same ty-pes of particles. For example, one value may be\nobtained from study of metallic spherules,.(Bruun, et &. , 1955), another from\nthe total influx of all dust particles (Opik, l95q. Stil1,serious disagreement exists among estimates of deposit for supposedly identical material.\nF o r example, estimates of the influx rate of black, magnetic spherules differ\nby as much as a factor of lo9 (Buddhue vs Grjebine). In the writer\'s opinion,\nthe large estimates of annual deposit of black spherules by Thomsen (1953;\n\n12\n\n20\n% 6 metric tons per year); Kreiken (1959; 3.1X106 metric tons per year):\nand Grjebine (1963; 2.4X1Os metric tons per year) represent contaminated\nsamples. Handy and Davidson (1953) showed that Thomsen\'s particles were probably industrial fly ash. Kreiken\'s samples were taken in Ankara, Turkey and\nTrobably reflect industrial products; even he suggested that the results were\nrather large. Grjebine, et al. (1963) reported qualitative analyses of particles collected from metropolitan France which cannot be ascribed to meteoric matter. Deletion of these large estimates lowers the range of values to\nonly about 6 orders of magnitude. We may reduce the range still further by\nrecalling that Buddhue\'s (1950) value cited as the lowest estimate was for a\nf\nspecial, limited case. I that is omitted from consideration, we are left\nwith estimates of annual deposit for black, magnetic spherules which range\nfrom lo2 to lo5 metric tons per year.\n\nThe values still are spread out over a considerable range. However,\nrecent estimates of the deposit of black, magnetic spherules appear to be in\nreasonably close agreement. Although slightly different sizes of particles\nwere examined, Crozier (1961, 1962); Fireman and Kistner (1961); Thiel and\n;\n;\n;\n;\nSchmidt (1961) Wright and Hodge (1962) Langway (1963) Schmidt (1963) and\nUtech (1963) each estimated the annual deposit of black spherules to be some\ninteger times lo5 metric tons per year. At the present stage of investigation the slight disagreements among these workers should not be discouraging. As pointed out earlier, little is known about influences upon spherule\ndeposit on the Earth. The apparent disagreement may be a clue that some\nforce is acting to produce variation in spherule deposit. Schmidt and Cohen\n(1964) considered this possibility, and found an apparent relationship of\nannual deposit estimates with geomagnetic latitude of the collecting site.\nIt was suggested that some of the scatter in estimates.,could be caused by the\nEarth\'s magnetic field (fig. 1 ) On the other hand, Opik (1956) concluded\n0.\nthat an electrically charged dust particle in space would be unaffected by\nthe terrestrial or solar magnetic field, particularly at meteoric speeds.\nSinger (1933),however, suggested that the geomagnetic field may influence\nparticle occurrence. Parkin and Hunter (1962) pointed out that the presence\nof ionized interplanetary gas would produce strong interactions with fine\nparticles. The particles would be brought to rest with respect to the gas,\ndrift with it, and would, perhaps, thus be concentrated at the auroral zones.\nThis process would be enhanced if the particles were traveling at low velocities. It is interesting to note that Hawkins (1963) reported radar meteor\nobservations suggesting low velocities for smaller particles. At present\nthe data are incomplete, and in order to verify or disprove the hypothesis\nmuch work remains to be done.\nThe cumulative rate of particle deposition is greatest for smaller particles,decreasing sharply for larger materials. This facet of the problem\nwas considered by many workers. Particle collections by Crozier (1961, 1 6 )\n92;\nSchmidt (1963); and Hodge, Wright, and Langway (1964) led to definition of\n1\nthe relationship for micron-sized particles, shown in figure 1 . Slight disagreement exist among the different studies, but these can be accounted for\nby local conditions at the collecting sites. Measurements of particle flux\nby satellites led to a wider distribution, shown in figure 12 (Alexander,\n9 2 . The total flux of extraterrestrial objects was examined by\net al., 1 6 )\n\nHawkins (1963), as shown in figure 13. These data clearly show that microscopic particles are by far the most abundant extraterrestrial matter in the\nvicinity of the Earth.\n\nAn apparent seasonal variation in the deposition of black, magnetic\nspherules was observed. Kizilirmak (1934) noted that fewer particles were\ndeposited in Ankara, Turkey in the month of February, while maximum numbers\nof particles were recovered in July. His work was continued by Siislu (1956),\nwho observed similar variations and found much greater numbers of particles\nthan were collected in the earlier study. Kreiken (1939) summarized the\nearlier Turkish observations, and suggested that the numbers of particles\ncollected were related to periods of meteoric activity, but that they lagged\nabout one month behind that phenomenon. Parkin and Hunter (1962) reported a\nmuch shorter lag relationship of particle occurrence to meteor showers. Maximum particle occurrences were observed only a few days after meteor showers.\nCrozier (1962) reported that, in general, maximum numbers of spherules were\ncollected in spring and summer months. Both Crozier\'s New Mexico station and\nthe site of Turkish observations are situated on about the same latitude,\nalthough on opposite sides of the globe. The fact that similar effects were\nobserved at each place suggests that their cause may have been world-wide.\n- al.\nParkin,et - (1962) also noted greater amounts of particles in the summer\nmonths. Hasegawa (1959) reported that Japanese workers found conflicting seasonal variations of particle deposition. Morikubo found largest numbers of\nparticles during August and September, as did the workers cited above. On\nthe other hand, Yamada found largest numbers of particles in January and\nFebruary, when all other workers reported fewest particles. This disagreement in Japanese data is difficult to explain, unless it has been caused by\nproximity to nearby industrial centers as appears likely.\nAll sites where seasonal variations in particle deposition were observed\nare located in the northern hemisphere. It would be valuable to know whether\nsimilar seasonal variations in particle deposition occur in the southern\nhemisphere. In particular, it would be important to determine whether or not\nany seasonal variations in the southern hemisphere occur at the same time of\nyear as those observed in the northern hemisphere. In view of the Yollowing,\none would expect southern hemisphere variations to occur 6 months later than\nin the northern hemisphere.\nInsight into the seasonal variation is offered by the radar meteor\nobservations of Keay (1963). Radar meteors are small particles on the order\nof those collected by the workers cited above. Consequently, variations in\nradar meteor flux is important to consider in this context. Keay found a\nhigh flux in the northern hemisphere during June, July, and August, the same\ntime when largest numbers of particles were collected (fig. 14). In the\nsouthern hemisphere, greater fluxes were observed during December, January,\nand February, almost exactly out of phase with northern hemisphere data.\nMaxima of radar meteor f l u x occurred during summer in each hemisphere. It\nis known that the inclination of the Earth\'s axis to the orbital plane alternately presents each hemisphere more directly to the Sun every 6 months. The\nfact that greater numbers of particles are collected and/or detected during\nthese times suggests that the Sun may exert an influence on particle deposit.\n\n14\n\nWhat follows is speculation. During summer when one hemisphere of the Earth\nis facing the Sun more directly, perhaps the solar wind is more effective in\n"blowing" particles onto the Earth, producing the variations in particle\ninflux observed. Should this be the case, one might expect to find greater\nnumbers of particles deposited during periods of intense solar activity such\nas sunspot maxima. The writer observed apparent correlation of particle frequency with periods of sunspot maxima in yet-to-be-published work on Antarctic\nparticles, but the relationships are not clear zut. It is hoped that other\nstudents of extraterrestrial particles will also consider this problem so\nthat more and better data will be obtained.\nEarlier workers suggested that the seasonal variations in particle\ndeposition was related to principal meteor showers. While this may account\nfor part of the variation, it seems incapable of explaining the similar but\nout-of-phase results for the different hemisphers.\nMeasurements of microscopic extraterrestrial particles in situ by artificial Earth satellites were conducted from the beginning of the space age.\nThese studies also yielded estimates of annual particle deposition on the\nEarth. However, the devices employed on satellites to detect particles were\nunable to differentiate between compositional types, and the values for annual\ndeposit represent the total influx of all particles to the Earth. As\ntable V I 1 shows, the satellite results are in remarkable agreement, indicating\nthat slightly more than lo6 metric tons of microscopic particles of all types\nare deposited on the Earth each year. Part of the agreement may be apparent,\nproduced by common assumptioms of particle velocity, density, and strength\nessential to interpret data from impact on satellites. Furthermore, as\nCrozier (1961) and Alexander (1963) cautioned, a large fraction of particles\nencountered by satellites may be in long-lived orbits around the Earth, and\nmay not be deposited. Still, it is interesting that the annual deposit of\nblack, metallic spherules is about 1 percent of the total particle influx as\n0\nsuggested by satellite measurements. T n significance of this percentage is\n\'e\nthat it is in excellent agreement with the abundance of macroscopic metallic\nmeteorites; Krinov (1961) noted that only about 6 percent of known falls of\nlarge meteorites were metallic. The apparent analogy in abundance is another\nsimilarity between metallic particles and metallic meteorites.\nTHEORIES OF ORIGIN\nThe data suggest that many microscopic, extraterrestrial particles are\nsimilar to larger meteorites in appearance, physical properties, chemical\ncomposition, and abundance. These relationships have weighted heavily upon\ntheories of particle origin.\nMurray and Renard (1883) suggested that the black, metallic spherules\nthey recovered from oceanic sediments were produced by "combustion" and\n"fragmentation" of metallic meteorites during their passage through the\nEarth\'s atmosphere. Buddhue (1950) proposed a similar hypothesis. He reasoned that the spherical shapes and highly polished surfaces indicated that\n\n15\n\nthe particles had been melted and suggested that meteorite ablation yielded\nmetallic micrometeorites. The writer interprets Buddhue\'s remarks on particle\norigin as including siliceous spherules, although they were not specifically\nmentioned. However, Bruun, et al. (1955) held a similar view, and suggested\nthat silicate spherules were produced by ablation of stony meteorites.\nCastaing and Fredriksson (1958) adopted the ablation hypothesis as an explanation of the oxidized particle rim and distribution of iron and nickel in the\nparticles. The argument is impressively supported by the data of quenching\nexperiments which Bruun, et al. (1955) conducted with artificial iron-nickelcarbon melts. Molten metal was poured into a container of water from a\nheight of about one meter, and black spherules identical to those found in\noceanic sediments were produced. Clearly, the experimental work suggested\nthat spherules could be produced through meteorite ablation. However, it was\nshown that even if the entire mass of each meteorite entering the Earth\'s\natmosphere were converted to spherules, this amount would be insufficient to\nproduce the number of spherules thought to fall to Earth each year (Parkin\nand Hunter, 1962). It would appear that this hy-potriesis is unable to account\nfor the majority of spherules. Only those particles which occur at the places\nof fall of known meteorites such as Sikhote-Alin, Canyon Diablo, and others\ncan be unequivocally explained by atmospheric ablation of a larger body. The\nwriter therefore adopts this mechanism for the production of meteoritic dust.\nWhipple (1950, 1951) and Opik (1956) showed that microscopic particles\nlarger than about 5 microns diameter would be heated to the melting point\nupon entering the atmosphere, Depending on entry angle, velocity, and materials comprising the particles, temperatures sufficient to produce thorough\nmelting could be achieved. In this way, spherules could be produced from\nangular particles. (It is difficult to comprehend how Parkin and Hunter\'s\nflakes survived entry.) Alternatively, pre-existing spherules would undergo\nmelting at least on surface layers to produce the oxidation zones noted.\nThis mechanism appears capable of explaining the presence of spherules\nremoved from the places of larger meteorite falls, and the writer proposes\nthat micrometeorites are formed in this manner.\nThe origin of meteoric dust is probably related to ablation of cometary\nmeteors in the Earth\'s atmosphere. Whipple (1950, 1955) regards comets as a\nconglomeration of ices of water, ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide\ntogether with solid debris of a meteoritic nature. Friction with the Earth\'s\natmosphere would cause the volatile ices to evaporate, freeing the solid particles to fall to Earth. Perhaps the amorphous coatings on metallic flakes\nrepresent samples of the cometary ices. This hypothesis may be supported by\nthe work of Parkin and Hunter (1962), who found that metallic flakes were\napparently related to meteoric activity; greater numbers of metallic flakes\nwere collected following meteor showers. They suggested that the metallic\nflakes were embedded in a mass of oils or waxes of low volatility, which\nevaporate and cool the flakes during retardation in the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nAs the waxes melt the metallic flakes would be freed in the meteoric wake.\nThis hypothesis, however, remains to be proved since the origin of metallic\nflakes is in question.\n\n1\n6\n\nThe production of cosmic dust and interplanetary dust is more speculative\nthan the apparent origins of the above materials. Probably, evaporation of\ncometary nuclei as they approach the Sun releases solid particles into space.\nWhipple (1955) estimated that about 30 tons per second of meteoritic material\nis continuously contributed to space by this mechanism. However, only about\n3 5 tons of the total are added effectively to space, because many particles\n.\nare lost through the actions of the interstellar wind, collisional destruction, attraction by Jupiter, and by the Poynting-Robertson effect. The\nlatter is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles by the "braking:\'\neffect of solar radiation, which causes a slow, secular decrease in the semimajor orbital axis of any small body, and, ultimately, fall into the Sun.\nWhipple\'s icy comet hypothesis appears to avoid the difficulty posed by\nthe Poynting-Robertson effect, among the others, by suggesting a continuous\nsource of interplanetary dust particles. In other words, at least as much\nsolid material (interplanetary dust) is thought to be added to interplanetary\nspace by the evaporation and/or disintegration of cometary nuclei as is lost\nto the Sun by the action of the Poynting-Robertson effect, and by other\nprocesses mentioned which might cause a decrease in its concentration,\nSimilar views are held by van de Hulst (1955). He estimated that inter1\'\n0\nplanetary dust particles are at low temperature (0 to 4 \xc2\xb0 K), and that they\nconsist of ices of water, ammonia, methane, and metal impurities.\nAlong the same lines Squires and Beard (1960) noted that surface evaporation of comets takes place as these bodies approach the Sun. The material\npresent is thus lost from the comet, and presumably forms its tail. Comets\nare though to lose a considerable fraction of their mass during one flight.\nThe formation of the dust particles themselves, however, is poorly understood\nat present.\nAt least part of interplanetary dust may originate in the asteroidal\nbelt through collisions between asteroids, meteoroids, and sporadic bodies.\nThe asteroidal belt is a region of space between the orbits of Mars and\nJupiter in which several hundred solid bodies of varying size are situated.\nMany believe that these were produced through the explosive breakup of a\nformer planet (Ringwood, 1961). Internal collisions among the resulting\nfragments could be a continuous source of dust particles (Piotrowski, 1953).\nHowever, Harwit (1963) argued that most of the debris would be produced in\nvery rare collisions between the largest asteroids, and that the dust cloud\nsupplied by this means would be highly variable. It was concluded that no\ntheory is capable of accounting for a steady cloud. Harwit suggested that a\npossible solution might be found in a process which would counter the\nPoynting-Robertson drag and permit grains to have longer lives in space.\nIf that were possible, the comet dust supply would then be adequate to account\nfor a steady-state dust cloud.\nIn addition to internal collisions in the asteroidal belt, it is possible that some dust particles may represent fragments of the lunar surface,\ndislodged by meteoroid or cometary impact (Gault, 1962; O\'Keefe, 1962, personal communication). However, the character of such material and the amount\ncontributed from this source are imperfectly known.\n\nI\n\nIt was once thought that interplanetary dust particles were remnants of\nthe original dust cloud from which our solar system originated. However, it\nhas been shown by Opik (1955) and by Wyatt and Whipple (1950) that even if our\nsolar system did originate in this way, most smaller particles would have been\nswept into the Sun by the Poynting-Robertson effect. It thus appears\nunlikely that interplanetary dust particles encountered by contemporary space\nvehicles could represent original galactic dust.\nAnother source of interplanetary dust might be intergalactic clouds of\ndust encountered periodically by our solar system as it drifts through space\n9 0 . The existence of such clouds in intergalactic space has been\n(Best, 1 6 )\npostulated because astronomical studies of the light emitted by stars and by\nthc Sun show that it has been scattered, absorbed, and polarized. While the\npossibility that such material m y contribute to the interplanetary dust\ncontent of our solar system cannot be ignored, present information is too\nlimited to permit serious evaluation of the proportion of interplanetary dust\nwhich might be supplied by this source.\nThe ultimate origin of particles in space was examined by Cassidy (1963).\nIt was suggested that, on the basis of chemical phase relationships at sufficiently high temperatures, it was possible for particles to form by sublimation from a supersaturated, primordial gas. Donn and Sears (1963) also\nconsidered the ultimate origin of particles. Crystal nucleation from a\nsupersaturated, primordial solar nebula was proposed. Subsequent aggregation\nof crystals into larger bodies was proposed to account for the development of\ncomets, planets, and other units. With the limited data available at present,\nhowever, it is difficult to evaluate these proposals properly.\n\nA summary of the sources of microscopic, extraterrestrial particles as\nindicated by the above discussion is presented in table VIII. Robey\'s (1939)\ngeneral scheme was adopted in constructing this table, although it was altered\nsomewhat from the original form to include the preferred terminology used in\nthis survey. The conclusions about particle origin which this table presents\nare tentative, however, and subject to revision. More definitive hypotheses\ncan be formulated only when the results of quantitative chemical and physical\nstudies of the particles become available.\nAmes Research Center\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nMoffett Field, Calif., Oct. 7, 1964\n\n18\n\nAPPEIVDIX\nCHRONOLOGICAL FG!SWi% OF PRFVIOUS WORK ON MICROSCOPIC\nEXTMTERRF1STRIAL PARTICLES (SXNCE\n\n1945)\n\nA brief chronological re\'sume\' of previous work on microscopic extraterrestrial particles since 1945 is presented below. The date 1945 was chosen\nas a limit for the present historical review of studies on such particles\nbecause Buddhue\'s (1950) monograph contains a survey of nearly all such\nresearch before that time. To allow this presentation to be employed as an\nextension of Buddhue\'s review to the present day, the form which he established will be observed.\nV\'iunov discussed the role of meteor streams in the causation of magnetic storms and polar aurorae. He concluded that cosmic dust may cause disturbances of the terrestrial magnetic field. The greatest magnetic storm\nand auroral acitivity was in March and in September-October, coinciding with\nthe periods of meteor showers.\n\n194-1 Landsberg reported collections of atmospheric dust collections at\nMt. Weather and Arlington, Virginia. He described 25 opaque, magnetic particles, ranging in size from 0.005 mm to 0 1 mm diameter. He though the mag.\nnetic particles were related to the Giacobinid meteor shower, as no magnetic\nparticles were recovered in the week before that event.\n1949 Fesenkov discussed the brightness of the zodiacal band and the total\nmass of asteroidal matter. The total mass of asteroidal material that produces the phenomenon of the zodiacal light is proportional to the minimum\nsize of particles. It was concluded that the transition between the asteroids\nand small fragments of matter is not continuous. Fairly large bodies, measured in kilometers, add nothing to the brightness of the zodiacal belt.\nRather, it is produced by smaller, secondary material which originated as a\nresult of continuous fragmentation in the region of the asteroidal ring.\nNorris and Hogg reported collections of magnetic dust particles from\nthe air. Contamination from local sources was found, but many particles gave\npositive tests for nickel and were considered of meteoritic origin.\nWhipple defined the term micrometeorite as an extraterrestrial body\nthat is sufficiently small to enter the Earth\'s atmosphere without being\ndamaged by encounter with the atmosphere. The limiting circumstance arises\nwhen the micrometeorite radiates energy rapidly enough that its temperature\nremains below its melting point as its motion is retarded by the atmosphere.\nThe limiting radius for a spherical micrometeorite varies approximately as\nthe fourth power of the melting temperature, the inverse cube of the velocity,\nthe inverse logarithmic density gradient at the point of maximum temperature,\nand the secant of zenith distance; it is about 3 to 5 microns. Larger\nparticles (20-40microns) may have been partially vaporized.\n\n1950 In this year Buddhue published a monograph on "meteoritic dust." This\nvaluable work contains a chronological survey of studies of such particles.\nBuddhue collected cosmic dust from the air in cans and on sticky slides, and\nto a lesser extent, from rain and snow. His work produced a valuable classification of such material, which is presented in an earlier section of this\nsurvey. The bulk of particles collected had physical properties and chemical\ncompositions most closely akin to those of magnetite than to other known\nminerals. On the basis of measurements of grams of dust per centimeter of\nrainfall, the annual deposit of cosmic dust was estimated to be from 8 metric\ntons per year to 126,000 metric tons per year over the entire Earth. The\nparticles examined were thought tohave been formed by ablation of meteorites\nduring their passage through the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nLink suggested that there is a layer of dust particles in the Earth\'s\natmosphere in order to explain light absorption observed during lunar\neclipses.\nPettersson and Rotschi described analyses of sediment cores from the\nPacific Ocean, in which unusually high amounts of Ni were found. The NiO\ncontent of the samples was roughly in inverse proportion to the rate of sedimentation. The origin of nickel in the sediments could have been from (1) sea\nwater, (2) submarine vulcanism, or (3) cosmic dust. A cosmic origin was\nfavored.\nWhipple proposed his "icy comet" hypothesis, in which the cometary\nnucleus is thoughttoconsist of a conglomerate of ices in which solid dust\nparticles are embedded. Vaporization of the ices by externally applied solar\nradiation frees the dust particles, which are then distributed along the\ncomet s path through space.\nWyatt and Whipple discussed the Poynting-Robertson effect on small\nparticles occurring in the solar system. They noted that the PoyntingRobertson effect will operate to sweep small particles of the solar system\ninto the Sun at a cosmically rapid rate. Because of this, they viewed meteor\nshowers as originating from comets.\n\n1951 Blanco reported collections of micrometeorites from rainwater and\nballoons in Puerto Rico. Several magnetic particles were obtained.\nOvenden reviewed the meteor hazards to space travel. Heavily armoured\nhulls or "meteor bumpers" were recomended for long-lived space stations.\nStruve discussed in general the nature and occurrence of dust in our\nsolar system.\nWhipple discussed the theory of micrometeorites - small particles\nwhich can radiate energy fast enough that they do not suffer melting by\natmospheric friction - in heterothermal atmospheres. A rigorous mathematical\ntreatment of the problem was presented.\n\n20\n\n1952 Beals discussed the materials of interstellar space, thought to be\nparts of the process of star formation. Gases and dust particles and clouds\nwere viewed as especially important for this process.\nGold showed that the dynamical interaction between galactic gas and\nthose dust particles which are elongated will lead-to a partial alinement of\nthe particles under certain circumstances. The direction of alinement is that\nof the relative velocity between gas and dust.\nHoffleit compiled an annoted bibliography on meteoritic dust.\nof\n\nA total\n\n505 references were listed.\n\nKrinov and Fonton detected cosmic dust at the place of the fall of the\nSikhote-Alin iron meteorite shower in the Soviet Union. They found traces of\nmelted matter on the surfaces of these meteorites, and postulated that the\ndust particles were swept from the melting surfaces of meteoric bodies during\npassage through the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nMillman surveyed data on meteor astronomy. The daily accretion of\nmeteoritic material by the Earth was estimated to range from lo3 to l o 4 tons.\nNininger discussed micrometeorites in a general description of meteorites and their occurrence in North America.\nIn this year Pettersson reported that the nickel content in most sediment cores from the central Pacific Ocean was much higher than the average\nvalue for normal continental rocks and sediments. It was suggested that this\nhigh nickel content may be caused by the presence of cosmic dust particles in\nthe sediments.\nDalton suggested that meteoritic material encountered by the Earth may\nrepresent fragments resulting from destruction of a planet between the orbits\nof Mars and Jupiter. This was offered in exploration of the object responsible for Meteor Crater, Arizona.\nThomsen collected magnetic spherules in Iowa City, Iowa on March 14,\n\n1951 following a heavy snowfall. Gravimetric analysis showed Fe203, 72 percent, SiO2, 28 percent, with the presence of Ni doubtful. The magnetic spher.8\nules ranged from.0.008 mm to 0 0 mm in diameter. The annual deposit of such\n,0,0\nmaterial over the entire Earth was calculated at 2 0 0 0 0 metric tons per\nyear, with the adopted density of particles as 4\n.\n\n1952 In the same year Handy and Davidson noted that industrial fly-ash,\nproduced in quantity in the midwestern United States, has essentially the\nsame composition as the "meteoritic dust" particles reported by Thomsen.\nThey noted that "from a spectroscopic analysis Thomsen reported nickel as\n\'doubtful\' in his samples; the authors believe that the identical adjective\napplies to the meteoritic origin of at least a part of his samples (for this\nreason).\n\n21\n\nAhnert also doubted whether Thomsen\'s metallic spherules are of meteoritic origin. He noted that similar nickel-free dust was collected near\nfactories.\n\n1954\n\nHerzberg described studies of the spectra of interstellar material.\nDiffuse interstellar spectral lines were not considered as due to absorption\nby atoms of the Fe group embedded in interstellar grains. Rather, they were\nattributed to transitions of negative atomic ions (0-,C-, N-, etc.) from\ntheir ground states to preionized states, corresponding to excitation of an\ninner electron.\nKaiser and Seaton discussed the relation of interplanetary dust to the\nphysical processes in the upper atmosphere of the earth. It was concluded\nthat the density of such particles is too low to play any significant role.\nIn this year Kizilirmak recovered metallic spherules from snow in and\naround Ankara, Turkey. The spherules contained iron, but no nickel, cobalt,\nor magnesium. More particles appear to have been recovered in the summer\nmonths; he noted a steady increase of particles until a maximum was reached at\nthe beginning of July, afterwards a slow decrease occurred in the number of\nparticles collected.\nSvestka examined Link\'s (1954) proposal\nparticles in the atmosphere and concluded that\nmicron cannot produce the absorption observed,\nbly formed from smaller particles on the order\n\nthat there is a layer of dust\nparticles larger than one\nand micrometeorites were probaof\nto\nem.\n\n1955 Bowen examined rainfall figures for many sites, and discovered that\nthere is a tendency for more rain to fall on certain dates than on others. A\nclose correspondence between the dates of rainfall maxima were found for both\nnorthern and southern hemispheres. The rainfall peaks occurred approximately\n30 days after prominent meteor showers, and it was suggested that they were\ndue to the nucleating effect of micrometeorites falling into cloud systems in\nthe lower atmosphere, the time difference being accounted for by the rate of\nfall through the atmosphere.\nBruun, Langer, and Pauly collected magnetic spherules from the deep\nocean bottom with a magnetic rake. Several types of particles were recovered,\nsome of which contained iron and nickel. Other particles had a silicate\ngroundmass "loaded with magnetic crystallites." It was proposed that atmospheric ablation of stony meteorites may be responsible for the formation of\nsuch particles. Ablation of iron meteorites was viewed as a likely cause of\nformation of the metallic spherules. Quenching experiments with iron-nickelcarbon melts showed that spherules very similar in every detail to oceanbottom particles can be artificially produced by rapid cooling of liquid\nmetal. This evidence appears to support the hypothesis that these particles\nwere formed by meteoritic ablation. The annual deposit was estimated to be\nabout 30 metric tons.\n\n22\n\n1955\n\nBuddhue reported a collection of micrometeorites from the Geminid\nshower of 1949. A total of 477 meteoritic spherules were collected on one\nslide; of these, 326 were black, 139 were siliceous, and 12 were metallic.\n\ndeJager stated that "the observed deposit of extraterrestrial dust on\n00\nthe Earth is by a factor of about 1 0 greater than the deposit computed on\nthe basis of observed meteor frequencies." Dust particles were thought to be\ncaptured in satellite orbits around the Earth, and drawn closer to its surface\nby the influence of solar radiation (Poynting-Robertson effect). It takes\nonly a short time for the particles to fall to Earth, from the continuous\nsupply furnished by this effect. The daily deposit of dust was estimated to\nbe between 1 6 billion grams and 9 billion grams.\n.\nHeard reported that more spherules were recovered from air sampling\nover industrial centers (Windsor, Ontario, Canada) than in the Arctic. "NO\nbright metallic spherules were found, and the particles that were are probably\nnot meteoritic.\nKallmann has compared micrometeorites with interplanetary ( zodiacal)\ndust in the size range 0.5 m m t o 0 0 2 mm. It was found that there were two\n.0\ncategories of dust particles in space; dense, fast moving meteoric particles\n"in all probability of cometary origin," and less dense, slower moving quiescent dust particles which are more abundant than the meteoroids and "whose\norigin might be connected with the origin of the planets."\n.~\nLaevastu and Mellis studied material described by Pettersson (1952).\nThey adopted a density of 5.2 for the spherules, and estimated that about\n125 tons per year of black cosmic spherules ranging in diameter from 0 0 mm\n.1\nto 0.23 mm reach the Earth. It was noted that the high nickel content of\nsediment cores reported by Pettersson is too great to be accounted for by the\ncosmic spherules. Instead, it was suggested that the iron and nickel appear\nto be derived in part from coprecipitation from sea water.\n\nLebedinsky stated that \'\'stars are originating as a result of gravitational condensation of diffuse matter (presumably dust). Diffuse matter is\nused up in formation of stars, but this is compensated by the ejection of\nmatter from stars, creating a steady state system."\nLevin found that the spatial density of dust particles decreased by a\nfactor Z / R with increased distance from the Sun. (The same relation was\nreported by others around this time also). In the vicinity of Earth, the\ndensity of particles was calculated to be about 10-23 g/cc.\nMinneart noted that information on interplanetary dust may be obtained\nfrom (1) the zodiacal light, (2) the solar corona, and (3) meteors. He notes\nthat methods (1) and (2) provide more information on the particles than can\nbe inferred from meteors. Dust particles were found to occur in the ecliptic\nplane, increasing in concentration as the Sun is approached. The total mass\nof interplanetary dust was estimated at loL8 g . The interplanetary dust was\nthought to originate from meteoroid bombardment or from comets in such a way\nas to replenish the dust lost to the Sun by the Poynting-Robertson effect.\n\n23\n\nOErt noted that interplanetary dust is absent in elliptical galactic\nsystems and certain nebulae, but is quite common in spiral nebulae. He\nattr.ibuted an important function to the interplanetary gas in which the dust\nparticles occur, viz, they are produced by condensation of the gas, and\nrepresent condensation nuclei.\n\n1935\n\n&ik suggested that the unusually high nickel content of deep-sea\ndeposits of the Pacific Ocean were due to concentrations of nickel-bearing\ncosmic dust, along the same lines as Pettersson (1952). This was proposed\nfollowing examination of some of Pettersson\'s samples.\nopik noted that data on observational meteors indicated that they were\na spongy, dust-ball type of much lower average density than that of the minerals of which they consist. They seemed to "decompose" (pulverize) from\naerodynamic pressure, along the lines of Whipple\'s comet model.\nIn another paper of this year, 6pik found that the major fraction of\nspace density (and from 30 to 40 percent of the recorded meteor numbers),\nbelong to the class of zodiacal particles. The distribution of heliocentric\nmotions of this material was concentrated in the plane of the ecliptic.\nStromgen noted that interplanetary dust particles contributed only\nabout 1 to 2 percent of the total mass in space. The heavy element content of\ninterstellar matter was about equally divided between the gaseous component\nand the dust particles; its total abundance was about 3 percent. The diffusion of interstellar dust particles through the interstellar gas under the\ninfluence of radiation pressure was slow, and the distribution of interstell a r gas and dust was "generally identical." Dust and gas clouds were present\nin "dark nebulae." Large agglomerations of interstellar matter have been\nviewed as the place of star formation, but evidence from chemical compositions\nwas "definitely against any mechanism of star formation that is characterized\nby concentration of the dust component relative to the gas component of\ninterstellar matter.\nvan de Hulst reviewed the status of data on the likely properties of\ninterplanetary dust particles. He estimated that the particles were at low\n1\'\n0\n\'\ntemperature (0 to 4 K); probably composed of ices of water, ammonia,\nmethane, and metal impurities less than 1 micron in diameter, that is, smaller\nthan expected (some process is thought to limit their rate of growth); shaped\nlike needles of flakes; and concentrated on the order of 10-13 particles per\ncc near the ecliptic plane. The dust particles were though to act on the\ninterplanetary (solar?) gas, cooling it and also absorbing radiation.\nWhipple discussed the amount of material added to the solar system by\ncomets. "Some 30 tons/second of meteoritic material are contributed continuHowever, most of this (all but about\nously in typical comet orbits..."\n3.5 tons/second) is lost by the effects of interstellar wind, collison, and\nPoynting-Robertson effect.\n\n1956 Berg and Meredith discussed results of a high altitude rocket experiment in which an impact detector was flown to measure micrometeorite flux.\nAlmost all recorded impacts occurred at altitudes greater than 85 km, and it\nwas suggested that they were caused by meteoroids.\nBracewell measured the freezing nucleus concentration at Palo Alto,\nCalifornia daily during the month of Ja.nuary, 1956. Maxima were discovered on\ndates corresponding to meteor showers.\nBurgess reviewed apparatus used in high altitude experiments, and\ndescribed measurements of micrometeorites conducted by means of microphone\ndetectors. No altitude dependence was shown by the impacts recorded, and it\nis possible that terrestrial dusts were encountered.\nCrozier collected magnetic spherules from the air in New Mexico. He\nfound that the rate of deposit of these particles might be correlated with\nmeteor showers.\nDubin described an experiment for the detection of meteoric particles\nby means of an artificial satellite. A brief review of the subject, together\nwith description of an acoustical particle detector for satellites, was\npresented.\nFredriksson found "several hundred black spherules, greater than\n\n35 microns diameter, from different layers in the cores" taken by the Swedish\nDeep-sea Expedition. These particles were composed of metallic iron nuclei\nsurrounded by magnetite. The spherules were thought to be of Tertiary age,\nand the depth of their occurrence precludes any industrial contamination.\nThey were thought to be of llcosmic"\norigin.\n.\nGriffith, Nordberg, and Stroud reviewed available data on the environment of an Earth satellite. One section of this review dealt with meteorites\nand micrometeorites.\n\nMayne examined the problem of the origin of helium in the Earth\'s\natmosphere. As a result of this work, it was proposed that helium may be\nproduced in extraterrestrial dust by cosmic radiation, and that dust particles\ncontribute helium to the atmosphere as they encounter the Earth. It was\nestimated that about 5000 tons of dust particles are deposited over the\nEarth\'s surface each day.\n\n..\n\nOpik reviewed the properties, amount, and terrestrial accretion of\ninterplanetary dust.\nSolid particles in interplanetary space will carry an electrostatic\ncharge of the order of 200 volts, caused by photoelectric effects of radiation\nfromthe solar corona. The lower limit of radius of metallic particles in\nspace is 7.2x10-6 cm as determined by radiation pressure, and 1.9X10m5 em for\ncompact stone fragments as shown by the disruptive force of electrostatic\ncharge. The actual radii of "dust ball" grains are probably about 0 0 to\n.2\n0.03 cm.\n\n25\n\nI\n\nParticles above the minimum size limit, when charged to 200 volts, are\nnot influenced appreciably in their motion by the terrestrial or solar magnetic fields, but are controlled by gravitational forces. The electrostatic\ncharge is of primary importance in the interaction of solid particles with\ninterplanetary gas. A quiescent, rotating cloud of zodiacal gas is incompatible with the data. Fast corpuscular radiation cannot he present in space\nwith an average density of more than 5 atoms per cm3, otherwise sputtering\neffects would destroy even meteorites. Only soft, corpuscular radiation is\ncompatible with observations. At the upper limit of radiation intensity,\ndrag of the corpuscular radiation on dust particles could exceed the PoyntingRobertson effect several hundred times.\nZodiacal dust consists of particles from\nto 0.03 em radius, fre.\nquency varying about as the inverse 2 8 power of radius. A mean space density\nThe particles have low reflecting power.\nis estimated at 2X10-21 gm\nThe zodiacal dust is the main source of terrestrial accretion, all other\nmeteoric or meteoritic sources together accounting for less than 1 percent of\nthe total.\nThree processes of accretion may occur: (1) accretion by direct collision, (2) accretion through the gravitational lens effect, and (3) two-stage\nt\naccretion through decaying satellite orbits. I was estimated that 2.5X105\nmetric tons of meteoric dust per year are deposited on Earth. Particles were\nthought to have velocities only slightly in excess of escape velocity from\nthe Earth.\nPlavec discussed the evolution of meteor showers. He noted that\n"although a relationship of several showers to the minor planets (asteroids)\ncannot be excluded, the majority of the streams no doubt are of cometary\norigin." Ejections from comets by internal forces appeared to be the main\ncauses of meteor streams.\nSinger reviewed knowledge about interplanetary dust particles, and\npresented a preliminary account of a simple charged-dust theory. These considerations were then applied to possible satellite experiments.\nStoiber, L y _ o p , Elberty, and McCrehan found magnetic (magnetite)\n__\n.\nspherules ranging in size from 0.005 mm to 0 1 mn in deep cores on Arctic ice\nisland T-3. They thought them to be \'brobably extraterrestrial."\nSiisl; collected iron dust from the air at Ankara, Turkey. He noted\nthat "it is probable that the iron particles are related to meteorites which\nare visually observed," although they did not contain any nickel.\n\nHecht and Patzak reported chemical analyses of cosmic spherules\nrecovered by the Swedish Deep-sea Expedition. They found compositional similarity with meteorites for Fe, Ni, and Co. Theyproposed a meteoritic origin.\n\n1957 Dufay postulated that "dust particles (are) formed by condensation of\nintergalactic gas.\n26\n\nHoenig reviewed the hazards of meteoroids for space flight and concluded that for short periods of time, hazards were regarded negligible.\n\n132\n9\'\n\nKizilirmak described an objective method for measuring the fall of\nmicrometeorites.\nLudlam reviewed knowledge on noctilucent clouds. These are thin\ncirrostratus-like clouds visible about an hour after sunset. They occur\nbetween altitudes of about 78 to 89 km, and are illuminated by the Sun\'s rays\nfrom beyond the horizon. The clouds occur mainly after mid-summer and are\nrestricted to north latitudes between 5 5 O and TO0. Particles in the clouds\nwere estimated to be less than 1 micron in diameter, with concentrations of\n.10-16 g/cc. Noctilucent clouds may be composed of ice particles, volcanic\ndust, meteoritic dust, or interplanetary dust. The clouds are most likely\ncomposed of small solid particles, which m y originate from terrestrial\nvolcanic eruptions or from meteors.\nStephenson reviewed the nature of interstellar dust, and especially\nthe problem of whether it could be accreted through interaction with interstellar gas. He concluded that such interaction cannot compensate for the\ninfluence of radiation pressure.\nYavnel reported nickel-iron particles 0.03 mm to 0 0 mm in diameter\n.6\noccurring in soil samples at the place of the fall of the Tunguska meteorite\nin the Soviet Union. He concluded that these particles were part of the\nmeteorite.\nAstapovich concluded from a study of work on micrometeorites and cosmic\ndust in the Earth\'s atmosphere that more than 16,000 tons fell on the Earth\neach year.\n\n1938\n\nCastaing and Fredriksson analyzed cosmic spherules from the Pacific\nOcean with the X-ray microanalyzer. They found nickel to be present, and in\ngreatest abundance (up to 31.6 percent) in the metallic nuclei of iron-nickel\nspherules. They considered it "most probable" that the spherules formed as\ndrops drawn off bigger meteorites by friction against the atmosphere.\nHodge and Rinehart collected dust from high altitudes using high flying\njet aircraft. "Some dark, shiny metallic particles may be extraterrestrial,\nsince their abundance does not change rapidly with altitude, as with particles\nof terrestrial origin."\nHodge and Wildt collected opaque, shiny spherules less than 0.015 mm\ndiameter on sticky slides. They thought them to be of meteoritic origin, in\nthat the rate of fall ana frequency distribution of particle sizes was the\nsame at several widely separated stations. Assuming that the density of the\ncounted particles was that of magnetite, they estimated the annual accretion\nfor the entire Earth to be 5OO,OOO metric tons.\n\nKolomensky and Yudzn discovered spherical particles in the fusion crust\nof the Sikhote-Alin meteorite. This appeared to support an origin of such\nmaterial by ablation of iron meteorites during passage through the Earth\'s\natmosphere.\n\n1958\n\nPettersson-and Fred-rik-s-sgn\ndescribed a study of cosmic spherules in\nsediment cores from the Pacific Ocean. The number of spherules was determined\nin various sediment fractions of several drill cores, but no correlation of\nspherule maxima between cores was possible. Spherules were found to occur in\nTertiary sediments, refuting the hypothesis that meteoritic falls were limited\nto the last 25,000 years. However, there were strong indications that the\nfrequency of spherules deposited in recent times was greater than in the past.\n(Or are the rocks just less perfectly compacted?) It was estimated that from\n2,400 metric tons to 5 0 0 metric tons of spherules are deposited on the\n,0\nEarth annually.\nRinehart described the distribution of meteoritic debris about the\nArizona meteorite crater. He employed a systematic sampling program and magnetic separation of meteoritic matter. He estimated that slightly less than\n1 , 0 tons of finely divided meteoritic material is present in the soil about\n200\nthe crater. He noted a concentration of material to the east of the crater.\nThe distribution is not smooth, but contains several areas where the density\nof meteoritic material is high. He postulated that the meteorite struck f r o m\nthe southwest, and sprayed fragments to their present position to the east of\nthe crater.\nSmales, Mapper, and Wood analyzed some of the spherules collected by\nPettersson, using radioactivation methods. They found that the spherules con.1\n.06\ntained from 0 0 to 3.9 micrograms Ni, 0 0 to 0.3 micrograms Co, 0 0 0 to\n.3\n0.53 micrograms Cu. They concluded that deep-sea spherules are closely\nsimilar to the iron meteorites.\n\n1959 Barber and Sweitzer conducted a literature search of material on micrometeorites and related phenomena. They listed a total of 282 articles in an\nannotated bibliography.\nDeirmendjian and Vestine described the nature of light from noctilucent\nclouds. The spectra may be explained in terms of primary scattering of direct\nsunlight by dielectric spheres with a maximum radius of 0.4 microns, and\ncertain night sky emissions. They found the possibility of an ice composition\nof the clouds formed by condensation of terrestrial water vapor unjustified\non physical grounds. They favored a siliceous composition and an interplanetary origin for the cloud particles.\n~\n\nDubin reviewed the nature of cosmic debris in interplanetary space,\nand described measurements of these particles conducted by satellites. The\ndaily mass a.ccretionrate of such particles to the Earth, as determined by\nthe Explorer I satellite, was 8.8~10~\nmetric tons per day for all interplanetary materials.\n\n28\n\n1959 Fessenkov discussed the nature of the zodiacal light, and concluded\nthat its properties can be accounted for by scattering of solar light by fine\ninterplanetary dust particles. He suggested that the \'dustparticles originated from the periodic comets without any appreciable velocity at their\ndisintegration.\nGazley, Kellogg, and Vestine reviewed available data on meteoroids in\nconnection with a general discussion of the space environment.\nHasegawa presented a discussion on collecting dust particles, together\nwith an examination of theories of origin. The most common collecting method\nused by Japanese workers was Vaseline-coated slides exposed to the air. He\nsummarized Japanese work on these particles. Most dust particles collected in\nJapan range from 3 to 50 microns in diameter. They contained iron and nickel,\nand it was estimated that O.gXlO-\' particles fell per e\n$ of the Earth each\nday. The origin of particles was reviewed, and meteorite disintegration,\nmeteor showers, and interplanetary dust were discussed as sources. The\ninfluence of meteorological variations on seasonal variations in dust occurrence was thought to be great. Most particles were thought to be due to\nmeteorite disintegration.\nKomissarov,et al. discussed a micrometeorite detector used on Soviet\nrockets and satellites.\nKreiken summarized work on the fallout of meteoritic iron particles at\nAnkara, Turkey. The number of particles appeared to be strongly affected by\nclimatological conditions, and few particles were recovered following rainfall. The number of particles collected varied with the seasons: fewest\nparticles were obtained in September, October, and November. It was estimated\nthat 3,lOO,OOO metric tons of iron particles fell on the Earth annually. This\nappears to be one of the highest estimates of the annual deposit of micrometeorites on record.\nKrinov discussed nanterrestrial dust particles. Meteoric dust results\nfrom melting of a meteor in the Earth\'s atmosphere; the particles are spherical and have an entirely different chemical and mineralogical composition\nfrom the bodies that produce them, because the particles are oxidized in the\nair. Meteoritic dust is produced when meteorites strike the ground and has\nthe same composit\'ion as the parent bodies. Cosmic dust enters the atmosphere\ndirectly from interplanetary space and is similar in composition to meteors.\nMicrometeorites are small particles with the basic properties of meteorites.\nLovering estimated that the influx rate of meteor particles during\nmeteor showers may be as much as five orders of magnitude greater than the\nbackground rates given by satellite measurements.\nManring discussed results of micrometeorite measurements on 1958 alpha\nand gamma satellites. A maximum in flux rate of particles 1 microns in\n0\ndiameter or larger was obtained from 1 February to 7 May 1958. Unfortunately,\nthe detector was apparently damaged by a meteor shower.\n\n1959 Marshall suggested that particulate matter in polar ice caps could be\nused as a stratigraphic tool. He described a method for investigating this\npossibility.\nNishibori and-Iskizaki described samples of micrometeorites recovered\nfrom snow at Syowa Base,- Antarctica. The particle-size ranged from 5 to 60\nmicrons.\nParkin and-Hunter reported collections of particles from the atmosphere. They observed black, magnetic spherules ranging from 5 to 35 microns\nand found one needle 240 microns by 2 microns. They also obtained coated\n0\nmetallic flakes in which they detected nickel.\nRedman discussed results of studies of the zodiacal light and solar\ncorona, and their bearing on interplanetary dust. Particles influencing\noptical measurements were about Z!X10-3 em diameter, and had a space density\nof about 1 particle per cubic kilometer.\nRobey presented a general discussion of micrometeorites. He thought\nsiliceous and magnetic spherules originated from vaporized meteorites at high\naltitudes in the Earth\'s atmosphere. He believed a large quantity of smallersized dust to be cometary, either arriving directly from comets or indirectly\nfrom exploding or disintegrating meteoroids. The possibility that a portion\nof the influx of meteoroids may contain a sizable percentage of frozen molecular fragments has influenced the results. A diagrammatic presentation of\nthe sources of interplanetary debris was presented.\nWhipple reviewed available data on solid particles in the solar system\nas a part of a symposium on space exploration. He offered suggestions for\nstudying these particles.\nYagoda obtained dust particles on plastic surfaces during stratospheric\nballoon flights. Positive nickel tests were found for material "presumably\nformed by the disintegration of larger units entering the top of the\natmosphere. "\nBest\n1960 - reviewed the works of several investigators on the accretion of\nmicrometeorites by the Earth. He noted that by far the most numerous parti0\ncles are of small size, 1 microns in diameter or less. He discussed several\npossible sources of meteoritic dust. These are (1)galactic dust outside the\norbit of Jupiter which is attracted by the Sun\'s gravitational pull; (2)\nasteroidal belt dust; (3) fragments of meteors; (4) cometary ablation; and\n(5) interstellar dust clouds encountered by our entire galaxy.\nBriggs computed the space density of dust particles at many points in\nthe solar system. The formula assumes the distribution of dust particles to\nhave rotational symmetry about an axis through the Sun which is normal to the\necliptic and also to have plane symmetry about the ecliptic. He concluded\nthat there was a strong concentration of dust particles in the plane of the\n.6\necliptic with a sharp maximum at a distance of 0 0 a.u. from the Sun.\n\n1960 Brown estimated, from data on observed meteorite falls in selected\nareas, that about 480 meteorites per year strike the Earth. He calculated the\nspace density of meteoritic bodies weighing one gram and more to be\nparticle par cubic kilometer.\nBuck described development of techniques for acoustic detection of\nmeteoric particles. He presected specific details of electronic devices\nemployed and rocket experimentation.\nCrozier recovered magnetic spherules from sediments ranging in age\nfrom Recent to Ordovician. He estimated that about l50,OOO metric tons of\nsuch spherules fall to Earth each year.\nDmitriev, Mishina, Mikirov, and Cherenkova investigated the influence\nof cosmic dust on the intensity of radiation passed through the atmosphere.\nThey observed a weakening of solar radiation during the period of major meteor\nshowers.\nDokuchayev considered the electrical change produced during passage of\nmeteors through the Earth\'s atmosphere. The passage of a meteor through the\nupper layers of the Earth\'s atmosphere is accompanied by the formation of a\nstrongly ionized trail consisting largely of electrons and ions of the meteor\nmaterial. He considered therefore, that the meteoric particle may leave\nbehind it a cloud of well conducting gas, surrounded by a gas having a considerably lower conductivity. The luminous aureole surrounding a moving meteor\nwas thus due to a corona discharge in the front part of the ionized trail.\nDubin compared the results of particle measurements by satellites 1958\nAlpha and Pioneer I These measurements indicated a daily accretion rate for\n.\nall types of interplanetary dust of l o 4 tons. This is equivalent to 3,6!10,000\ntons per year for the entire surface of the Earth. If the particles are\nassumed to move with a velocity of 30 km per second, the density of interplanetary matter at the position of the Earth\'s orbit was 5X10-22 g/cc. There\nwere indications, however, that the particles may move with a lower velocity\nrelative to the Earth. High impact rates on one portion of the orbit of\nsatellite 19>8Alpha were attributed to a meteor shower. Data from Pioneer I\nsuggested that the particles are concentrated in the plane of the ecliptic.\nA daily variation in the number of particles impacting was noted, probably\nbecause of the heliocentric motion of the Earth.\nFeller-Kniepmeier and Uhlig described electron-probe microanalyzer\nanalyses of metallic meteorites. They studied macroscopic meteorites, not\nmicrometeorites, but included a valuable description of experimental procedure\nand sample preparation.\nFesenkov reviewed present knowledge on the occurrence, characteristics,\nand origin of both interplanetary dust and meteoritic dust. Primary emphasis\nwas placed on Soviet work.\n\n1960\n\nGallagher and Eshelen discussed radar measurements which suggested\nthat the conventional view of a few streams of meteor particles plus a large\nbackground of independently travelling sporadic particles is no longer valid.\nInstead, most of the background activity is caused by particles concentrated\ninto numerous shower orbits. The concentrations of particles are very small,\nand it was estimated that there must be millions o shower orbits which interf\nsect the orbit of the Earth. The number of independent shower orbits is so\ngreat, and the Earth encounters a given grouping so rarely, that is would be\npractically impossible to predict the occurrence of particular showers. The\nobserved particle groupings, as most meteoric material in the solar system\nwas believed to be associated with past or present comets, may indicate the\npresence of a large number of very small, subvisible comets.\nHawkins discussed asteroidal fragments and large meteorites. If the\ninflux of such objects has been constant, the Earth has collected the equivalent of an asteroid 14 km in diameter during the last 5 1 \' yrs. It was\nx0\nestimated that the asteroids consist of 16.7 percent Ni-Fe, indicating a\nprimary object that before breakup was intermediate in size between the Moon\nand Mars. The space density of meteorites was shown to vary as (radius)-4\nand the total mass of meteorites with radius between 1 em and 1 km was at\nleast 5.6~10-24\ng\nThe size distribution of particles produced by the\ncrushing of rock was similar to that found for meteorites and suggests that\nmeteorites undergo a considerable number of collisions in space.\nHodge conducted a study of meteoritic particles from the Arizona meteorite crater, and estimated that the total mass of the original meteoritic\nmaterial represented by these particles was about 12,300 short tons. This\nwork also included atmospheric dust collected by high-flying vehicles. It\nwas found that the amount of terrestrial dust at heights of 50,000 feet or\nmore is greater than commonly believed. The influx of meteoritic particles\ninto the Earth\'s atmosphere was less than generally quoted, only 28 particles\nper cubic meter of air, most in the size range from 3 microns to 6 microns in\ndiameter\n\n.\n\nHunter and Parkin described studies of cosmic spherules collected from\nsurface sediments of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Three types of spherules were recognized: stones, stony iron, and iron. The stones ranged in\nsize from 15-500 microns, the stony irons from 20-100 microns, and the irons\nfrom 20-384 microns. More spherules were found in the Pacific sample than in\nthe Atlantic ones. The irons were blacker, smoother, and more rounded than\nthe stones, which were quite gray and rough by comparison. Iron spherules\ncontain up to 70 percent Ni in their center, but only about 1 percent in their\noxidized shell. Stony spherules were less regular in form, often having\ncraters on the surface. Creamy-white to pale yellow-green colorations were\nseen at the base of craters. The majority of stony spherules were solid\ngray-black throughout. The stones were a magnesium-rich, fine-grained olivine, and contained nickel. The origin of the particles were probably from\nmeteorites or from the zodiacal cloud.\nJonah reviewed the physical properties of solid debris in space in\nconnection with the design of space vehicles. He examined the mass, density,\n\n32\n\nand total number of particles. He concluded that if the density of meteors\nwere taken as 0.3 gm/cm3, a zero magnitude meteor of the dust ball type would\nbe about 5 cm in diameter, and would contain about one million particles with\nan average density of about 4 gm/cm3.\n\n1960\nKrinov discussed microscopic dust particles -from the Sikhote-Alin\nmeteorite shower. He believes that meteorite showers are usually caused by\nfragmentation of one large meteorite as it passes through the atmosphere. In\nthe process, many microscopic dust particles become separated from the main\nmeteorite mass. These have the fusion crust and morphology of meteorites,\nand differ from cosmic dust that enters the atmosphere directly from space in\nthat cosmic dust particles are practically unaltered by impact with the\natmosphere.\nKrzeminski briefly described the matter occurring in space between the\nEarth and Sun. His article is a review of earlier work.\nLaGow and Alexander studied direct measurements of particles by instruments on satellite 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta. Assuming that a significant\nnumber of meteoritic particles were not in orbit around the Earth, they suggested the daily influx of interplanetary matter on the Earth (particles\nbetween mass 1.2X10-\'\ng and 1.2X10-10 g) is approximately lo4 tons per day.\nThey discovered a daily variation in the dust particle density near the Earth.\nLiller examined the tails of comets 1956h and 1957d photoelectrically.\nHis studies showed that, at a solar distance of about two-thirds at an a.u.,\nmost of the radiation between A 3400 and h 6400 was of a continuous nature\nand redder than sunlight. This strongly suggested that spherules of iron in\nthe comet tails, with an average diameter of 0 6 micron and mass of 8 ~ 1 0 - l ~\n.\ngm, produced this radiation.\nLoyering, Parry, and Jaeger studied temperature and mass losses by iron\nmeteorites during ablation in the Earth\'s atmosphere. Temperature gradients\nwere studied by examination of thermal alteration rims. The base of the\nthermal alteration rim indicates the depth to which a certain temperature\npenetrated. For a large meteorite, the temperature is given by\nt = to exp(-~x/~)\nwhere\nt\n\ninitial temperature\n\nto\n\nmelting temperature\n\nU\n\nrate of ablation\n\nX\n\ndistance\n\nk\n\nthermal diffusivity, K/pc\n\n33\n\nK\n\nthermal conductivity\n\nP\n\ndensity\n\nC\n\nspecific heat\n\nSurface ablation and heat alteration as described by the equation are not\nsignificantly affected by the size of the meteorite because heat penetration\nis negligible. Preheating does not affect the establishment of a steadystate condition. From ablation rates and time of flight through the atmosphere, it was estimated that two ataxites each lost about 27 percent by\nablation.\n&ringer and Mangi-ng discussed metallographic examination of the heataffected surface zone of the Grant meteorite. This zone serves as a record\nof the thermal gradient which caused it during aerodynamic heating as it fell\nto Earth. The average rate of ablation was of the order of 1 to 2 mm per see.\nIf the meteorite spent 20 or 30 see in passing through the atmosphere, the\nestimated total amount of ablation would be of the order of 2 to 6 em, less\nthan predicted by earlier workers.\nNazarova reported the results of "meteoritic dust" impacts on Soviet\nsatellites and rockets. The density of meteoric matter in space near the\nEarth was found to vary in time and with position. High counting rates on\nMay 15, 1958 (four orders of magnitude greater than other values) suggested\nthat the satellite encountered a meteor shower.\nNeugebauer compiled an annotated bibliography of articles dealing with\nthe space environment of the Earth.\nPettersson presented a popular account of his\n\n1958 work.\n\n- reviewed data on solid particles in interplanetary space as a\nShaw\npart of a larger work on the natural environment of space. He presented a\ncomprehensive compilation of existing information and current thoughts on the\nasteroids, comets, meteors, and interplanetary dust. He included a valuable\nbibliography\n\n.\n\nSquires and Beard noted that surface evaporation of comets takes place\nas these bodies approach the Sun. The side facing the sun is warmed, and the\nmaterial present there is lost fromthe comet, presumably forming its tail.\nComets lost a considerable fraction of their mass during one flight. Calculations suggested that an average comet nuclear radius could be as little as\n300 meters if the material density is as much as 0.005 g/cc. The comet\n5\n\' from an average value of 165O K throughout\ntemperatures varied less than 2\ntheir visible flight. Solar heating and evaporation were believed to be\nresponsible for considerable changes in the cometary orbit. The material\nlost fromthe comet m y have some sort of significance in connection\nwith interplanetary dust.\n\n1961\n\nAlexander described micrometeorite studies fromEarth satellites. He\nestimated the amoung of material falling to Earth to be about lo4 tons per\nday.\n\n34\n\n1961\n\nAlexander, McCracken, and LaGow reported exceptionally high interplanetary dust particle activity on satellite 1959 Eta at the time of the Leonid\nmeteor shower. Many impacts of particles up to about 0.014 mm in diameter\nwere recorded in a very short time.\nBain considered possible effects on magnetic field alinement on meteoric ionization. Field alinement of ionization along the Earth\'s magnetic\nlines results in enhanced scattering efficiencies. The magnetic field can\nmaintain such a field alinement on ionization produced by a meteor trail,\nperhaps explaining the long duration of some meteor trails. Both overdense\nand underdense meteors would have long duration; however, underdense meteors\nwould be detectable only on radar.\nA considerable daylight radiant activity in the summer months was\nobserved in Manchester, England, where these radiants lie very close to the\nplane of the ecliptic. This configuration placed the radiants within a few\ndegrees of being parallel to the lines of force of the Earth\'s magnetic field.\nThus, any general concentration of sporadic meteors would manifest itself as\nan increase in activity in the summer months.\nBeard noted that planetary and solar gravitational attractions,\ntogether with angular momentum considerations, would tend to concentrate\ninterplanetary dust in the plane of the ecliptic. This concentration varies\nas the inverse three-halves power of the solar distance, according to Beard.\nObservations of the dust-scattered light in the solar corona showed that the\nconcentration of dust in interplanetary space was\nto\nparticles\nper cc at the position of the Earth\'s orbit. However, space vehicle observations gave a flux density of\nparticles per cc at a height of 3000 km\nabove the Earth. These observations were taken to indicate the presence of a\ndust blanket about the planets.\nBjork summarized current knowledge on the flux rate, mass, velocity,\nand density of meteoroids to assess their effects on space vehicles. He\nexamined and tabulated the probability of meteoroid puncture as a function of\nvehicle area, exposure time, and skin thickness so that armor required to\nprotect space vehicles could be determined.\nBrandt and Hodge discussed the origin of the gegenschein. They\nbelieve it was thought that this effect is produced as a result of sunlight\non a dust tail behind the Earth. They consider the Moon to be the source of\nthe dust.\nBrown revised his earlier estimate of the total fall of meteorites\nupon the Earth to 560 per year.\n\nCohen described measurements of the flux of small extraterrestrial\nparticles using wire grids and microphones mounted on rockets and satellites.\nThe mean influx of particles large enough to break the grid wires was likely\nto be less than 1.7x10-3 particles/m2/sec, with short periods where the\ninflux rates are greater. The average influx of particles on microphone\ndetectors was 5.7~lO-~\nparticles/n?/sec.\nThe mass distribution or" particulate influx was most similar to that found for large meteor(ite)s.\n\n35\n\n1961 Crozier compared the annual mass accretion of particles to the Earth\nas determined by satellites (390,000 metric tons) with that of ground level\nstudies of magnetic spherules ( 0 0 0 metric tons). He regarded the satellite\n9,0\ndata as uncertain because of the possibility that many of the particles\nencountered may be in orbit around the Earth.\nDauvillier presented a discussion about cosmic dust. He described the\nevolution, distribution, and nature of cosmic dust as related to comets,\nasteroids, meteors, and meteorites.\nDavison and WinsLox described the hazards to space vehicles resulting\nfrom natural space debris. They reviewed briefly the several types of materials which may be encountered in space 6nd listed a total of 7 references.\n8\nDingle argued that meteorite fall and dust influx is greater now than\nin the past.\nDubin described the instrumentation on the Explorer I satellite for\ndetecting particulate matter in space. He showed a diurnal dependence by\npointing out that 90 percent of the impacts occurred on the dawn side of the\nEarth between the hours of midnight and noon. He ascribed higher impacts\nregistered over short times to meteor showers. He estimated that lo4 tons of\ninterplanetary matter are deposited on the Earth each day.\nEichelberger and Gehring discussed the effects of meteoroid impacts on\nspace vehicles. They described the mechanism of crater formation by hypervelocity impact and applied it to various models of the behavior of materials\nand to the design of spacecraft.\nEricson, Ewing, Wollin, and Heezen noted the presence of "cosmic spherules" in abyssal sediments taken from the Atlantic Ocean.\nFesenkov reviewed investigations of meteorites and micrometeorites\nconducted by earlier workers.\nFireman and Kistner collected dust from altitudes greater than 4 , 0\n000\nfeet using airplanes and balloons. The chemical composition of this material\n0\nwas very different from that of the deep-sea spherules. Fewer than 1 percent\nof the high altitude particles contained Fe, Ni, and Co in meteoritic proportions. The spatial density of opaque dust particles at high altitudes varied\nconsiderably, suggesting the existence of dust clouds. Their data indicated\nthat about 30,000 metric tons of material with Fe/Ni ratios similar to that\nof meteorites fell to Earth each year.\nFisher discussed the erosion of iron meteorites in space. He estimated\nthe m a x i m erosion rate to be approximately 111\'\n.X08\nem per year, suggesting\nthat previous erosion estimates were at least an order of magnitude too large.\nFletcher reviewed Bowen\'s (1955) hypothesis that meteoritic dust particles serve as freezing nuclei for rainfall, citing arguments in favor of\nthe hypothesis, as well as presenting criticisms of the theory. The principal\n\nobjection to the postulated explanation was that no simple mechanism for\nlimiting the size range of efficient nuclei or transporting agency has yet\nbeen discovered.\nFredriksson described work on spherules collected in Hawaii. While\nthese were similar to cosmic spherules, their comp-osition and structure are\ndifferent. They were deficient in nickel and were usually thin, empty,\nfragile shells. These were thought to be of volcanic origin.\nFremlin suggested that the concentration of dust in the space near the\nEarth was caused by ablation of meteorites which graze the outer portion of\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere.\nGoettleman,et al. reviewed data of meteor f l u x and mass obtained by\nterrestrial observations. They found that this information encompasses only\nthe larger particles which may be encountered by a space vehicle. However,\ncalculations of zodiacal light scattering have produced estimates of the character and size of interplanetary dust particles. Four classes of material\nwere postulated; (1) high density spheres about 20 microns in diameter, (2)\nlow density particles less than 20 microns in diameter, (3) solld, high density particles about 1 micron diameter, and (4) original galactic dust less\nthan 1 micron diameter.\nSatellite data showed that at some times meteoroid impacts were higher\nthan at others. These were ascribed to many meteor shower orbits which intersect the orbit of the Earth. Characteristic dimensions of these particle\nconcentrations might be about 1 9 meters, since the intersection of a meteor\n0\nstream with the Earth might last from a few hours to a day. In addition, the\nmeasurements may indicate the presence of a number of very small, subvisual\ncomets.\nFrom this information, three theoretical models of meteoroid occurrence\nin space were examined. These were: (1) a continuous particle field, with\nno variation in the meteoroid flux with time; (2) meteoroid clouds in which\nthe particle concentration varies with position in the cloud away from a\ncenter of highest particle density; and (3) an altitude-dependent version of\nthe continuous particle field model in which a meteoroid halo or belt surrounds the Earth to an altitude of about 4000 km.\nGol-dmannand Hollister compiled an annotated bibliography on effects\nof micrometeorites on space vehicles. It included a total of 116 references.\nHagihara discussed gaps in the distribution of asteroids, and concluded that these result from the accumulated effects of disturbing actions\nby small masses passing close by.\nHart reviewed data on micrometeoroids in relation to simulation studies for spacecraft design.\nHemenway, Fullam, and Phillips collectedolarge quantities of very\nsmall, high density particles approximately 75 A in size on high altitude\n\n37\n\nI\n\naircraft flights over Antarctica. The composition of these particles was\nsimilar to that of meteorites. Because of their small size, they were named\nnanometeorites.\n\n1961 Hibbs concluded from particle impacts on sensors aboard satellite\n1958 Alpha that the particles were traveling in cIosed orbits around the\nEarth, without sufficient energy to escape from the Earth\'s gravitational\nfield. He found no apparent correlation between satellite position (relative\nto the Earth\'s motion around the Sun) and average particle impact rate. A\ndecreasing impact rate with altitude was suggested by the data.\nHodge and Wright collected particulate matter from the upper atmosphere\nbetween 50,000 and 90,000 feet during aircraft flights. They estimated the\naverage space density of particles larger than 3 microns in diameter to be\n150 per cubic meter, but the space density varied considerably from place to\nplace. They believed only a small percentage of these particles was to be of\npossible extraterrestrial origin. An upper limit for the space density of\n0\n0\ndust was from 1 to 2 particles larger than 3 microns diameter per cubic\nmeter, and an upper limit to the influx rate of meteoritic material was\napproximately one million tons per day. Two-thirds of all particles were\nbetween 3 and 6 microns in diameter.\nHodge, Wright, and Hoffleit compiled an annotated bibliography on\ninterplanetary dust with 205 references, including many on particles designated-here as micrometeorites.\nHunter and Parkin found the remains of cosmic spherules in tertiary\nrock from Barbados. The metallic nuclei of the spherules had been removed by\nweathering, leaving only the iron oxide outer shell. Density and X-ray data\nshowed this material to be magnetite.\nIngham examined the nature and distribution of interplanetary dust by\nobserving light in high altitude experiments. He estimated smallest particles\n.\nin space to be 0 2 to 0.3 micron in diameter. The mass density of particles\nin interplanetary space near the plane of the ecliptic was estimated to be\nabout\ngm\nIsakovich and Rox discussed the acoustic method of detecting particles\nby Earth satellites. They stressed that careful calibration of piezoelectric\nelements is essential for obtaining usable data.\nJacchia and Whipple noted that meteors of interstellar origin would\nmove in hyperbolic orbits around the Sun. These were thought to be gravitational members of the solar system. The vast majority (more than 99 percent)\n"must be cometary in origin." The number of meteoroids produced by the\nencounter of meteorites with the Moon was viewed as quite insignificant, and\ncomets "seen to supply essentially all the visual meteors and probably also\nsmaller meteoroids.\nJones and others reviewed data on meteoroids as a part of a study to\ndevelop techniques for simulating the natural environment o f interplanetary\nspace.\n\n38\n\n1961 Kaiser reviewed several methods for studying interplanetary dust.\nAmong them are optical meteors, radio meteors, light scattering, accretion by\nthe Earth, rocket and satellite experiments, and atmospheric studies. He\nsummarized the results obtained by each method.\nKeay and Ellyett described the latitude dependence of radar meteor\nshowers. At a given observing station they found meteor rates to depend very\nstrongly on the geographical location of the station.\nKomissarov, et al. described apparatus employed in measuring the "solid\ncomponent of interplanetary matter" on Soviet Earth satellites. This consisted of a ballistic-sensitive plate, which when disi$aced by particle impact\nyielded an electronic signal proportional to the particle\'s energy, Particles\nwith mass from 8~10-\' to 2.65~10-\' g were encountered with an average frequency of\nimpacts/m2/sec. A sharp increase in the number of impacts\nwas registered on May 5, 1958.\nLaevastu and Mellis studied the size distribution of cosmic spherules\nfound in sediments and concluded that "the mass of particles in equal size\n(diameter) intervals remains constant, in accord with the relation\n\nwhere\n\nv\n\nvolume or mass of a single spherule in a given size group or diameter\ninterval\n\nN\n\nnumber of spherules in this size group"\n\nLaGow,-Schaefer, and Schaffert described equipment used on U. S\n.\nsatellites to detect particulate matter in space with an average flux of\n3.6x10-~ impacts/m2/sec. The mean daily number of meteoric particles striking the Earth was estimated to be 4.0x10l8 collisions/day.\nManring discussed the nature of interplanetary matter, and reviewed the\nprogress made in study of these particles, including descriptions of spaceborne micrometeoroid detectors. He offered suggestions for future studies of\nsuch materials and suggested techniques for determing particle mass, density,\ndiameter, and composition from space vehicles.\nMcCoy reviewed the space environment as a part of a study of hyperenvironmentsimulation for spacecraft design. He devoted particular attention\nto particle impacts on materials likely to be used in spacecraft.\napik calculated the probabilities of collision, ejection, and orbital\nchange in random close encounters of stray bodies with the planets.\nRasool examined the effect of major meteoric showers on the densities\nof the upper atmosphere. He concluded that with a daily accretion of lo6 g\nof interplanetary dust, density will increase 5 to 8 percent at 344 and 660 km\naltitudes during major meteor showers.\n\n39\n\n1961\n\nRosinski and Snow calculated the size distribution of secondary particulate matter formed from condensing vapors in meteoric trains. They found\nthe diameters of the particles to be approximately proportional to the size of\nthe meteor and calculated the particles to be smaller than 1 O O p in diameter.\nThey found the average concentration of secondary particles to be higher than\nthat of sporadic meteors and suggested that Bowen\'s- rainfall-hypothesis should\nbe re-examined in light of these data.\nSalisbury and Salisbury compiled an extensive annotated bibliography of\nlunar and planetary research.\nSinger pointed out that rather than there being a "dust belt" about the\nEarth, there is in reality a "modest dust shell." He postulated a continuous\n00\nincrease in dust concentration to a maximum at about 2 0 to 3000 km above\nsea level. This was only a few times the value of dust concentration in\n00\ninterplanetary space, not the factor of 1 0 as given by Beard.\nSkolnick examined magnetic spherules in well cuttings and cores of\nsedimentary rocks of Cretaceous, Miocene, and Pleistocene ages from central\nCalifornia. He postulated that this material was dominantly meteoritic in\norigin and that the Earth had been subjected to the fall of meteorite showers\nsince at least late Cretaceous time.\nSoberman,et~\nal. described experiments with the "Venus Fly-Trap," micrometeorite collector rocket. In this work specially prepared particle\ncollectors were exposed on an Aerobee rocket flight at altitudes between 08\nand 168 km above the Earth and were successfully recovered. Three types of\nparticles believed to be of extraterrestrial origin were identified. These\nwere (1) dense spheres, 16 percent of the total; (2) irregular submicron particles similar in appearance to meteorites, 72 percent of the total; and (3)\nextremely irregular ("fluffy") particles, 12 percent of the total. The parti.\ncles ranged from 0.1to 1 0 micron in diameter, most having the smaller sizes.\nElectron diffraction studies were inconclusive, and the writers \' I . . . are\nbeginning to suspect that micrometeorite particles do not have a crystal\nstructure or that any original crystal structure has been scrambled by cosmic\nray bombardment." The study indicated that (1) submicron particles are\npresent in the region of space adjacent to the Earth; (2) the particles had\nlow impact velocities upon the detectors and may have been in orbit around\nthe Earth; and (3) an unexpectedly large number of particles were collected,\nsuggesting the possibility of a meteorite shower.\nThiel and Schmidt reported the occurrence of metallic spherules in\nAntarctic ice cores. From data on the particle size, number, and annual\naccumulation of snow at collecting sites, the annual deposit of spherules was\nestimated to be 184,000 metric tons.\nUtech described cosmic spherules from the New Red Sandstone. He recognized three types of hollow spherules: (1) rough, gray, Fe-Si spherules; (2)\nsmooth, black Fe-Si spherules; and (3) rough, gray spherules up to 1.5 mm in.\ndiameter, Fe-Si, with a variety of shape modifications. He concluded that\nthe spherules had a cosmic origin.\n\n4\n0\n\n1961\n\nWhipple studied acoustical impacts of micrometeoroids on sensors\nshow clearly that a\ncarried on rockets and satellites, and these data\nhigh concentration of interplanetary dust occurs near the Earth." He thought\nthe concentration of interplanetary dust decreased roughly as the inverse l . b\npower of the distance from the Earth\'s surface, out to about 1 0 0 0 km, where\n0,0\nit approximates the concentration of the zodiacal dust cloud. He found the\n0\n00\ndust in the vicinity of the Earth to be between 1 0 and 1 0 times more concentrated than in the zodiacal cloud.\n\n"...\n\nIn another paper, Whipple stated that the "small, particulate matter\nof the solar system can be viewed as originating primarily in comets, distributed originally from typical comet orbits, with a considerable concentration\ntoward the plane of the ecliptic." He discussed the physical properties of\nthe dust, and also meteoritic etching rates in space.\nWiederhorn reviewed the meteoroid environment in connection with a\nstudy of effects of the space environment on liquid propellants and their\nstorage systems.\nWright, Hodge, and Fireman reviewed the status of studies of micrometeorites, and described particles from the Earth\'s atmosphere, collected by\nhigh altitude aircraft. The average space density of particles greater than\n3 microns diameter was 250 particles per cubic meter at 50,000 feet altitude.\nThis value increased greatly for lower altitudes and appeared to decrease\nslowly for higher altitudes. Most of particles were transparent or semitransparent, with only about 1 percent resembling meteoritic material in appearance. These few particles led to an upper limit for the influx rate of\nmeteoritic material of less than lo6 tons per day.\nZaglow and Kellogg analyzed metallic spheroids from Meteor Crater,\nArizona, using X-ray methods. Positive identification of kamacite, taenite,\nquartz, and magnetite were made. The existence of quartz in the spheroids\nwas not thought to be inconsistent with an origin of the particles from a\nmetallic vapor cloud.\n\n1962 Alexander described cosmic dust experiments conducted by the Mariner 11\nVenus probe. If the flux of dust particles in interplanetary space were\nassumed to be omnidirectional, about l o 4 times as many particles would be\nencountered by satellites near the Earth as were measured by Mariner 11. Previous studies of dust particles in interplanetary space indicated a flux lo2\ntimes greater than the preliminary Mariner I1 value.\nAlexander, McCracken,_Secretan, and Berg reviewed rocket, satellite,\nand space-probe measurements of interplanetary dust. They described and\ntabulated measurements from microphone systems, photomultiplier and rocket\ncollection systems, and fracture experiments. They used these data for\nestimating the cumulative mass distribution of the particles in the vicinity\nof the Earth and the annual mass accretion rate (104 tons per day). The\nfluctuations of the influx rate, however, suggested that the dust particles\nare not in long-lived orbits around the Earth. They estimated the average\nmass density of all particles to be approximately 1 g/cm3.\n\n41\n\n1962\n\nBriggs described a model for the distribution of interplanetary meteoric particles based on orbital data from observed meteors and the zodiacal\nlight. He derived a steady-state distribution of orbits from these considerations as modified by the Poynting-Robertson effect.\nCarleton studied the experiments of Volz and Goody (1962), and concluded that interplanetary dust particles must be essentially in orbit about\nthe Earth. He further concluded that their contribution to the total mass\naccretion was "not overwhelming," and any effects of ionization or excitation\nwere negligible. The dust cloud about the Earth was an adequate source of\natmospheric dust, and about 260 metric tons per day are deposited on the\nEarth.\nCarlson reviewed the space environment as a part of a study of the\nsimulation of effects of meteoroids on space vehicles.\nCaylor surveyed the effects of meteoroids on space vehicles. After\nmaking a general review of natural space debris, he devoted particular attention to meteoroid flux and penetration.\nCrozier described studies on black, magnetic spherules collected from\nthe atmosphere in New Mexico over a five year period. The average numerical\nrate of deposition for spherules larger than 5 microns diameter was 2.8~10-~\nThe average rate of mass accretion to the Earth was\nparticles/S/sec.\n1.6~10~\nmetric tons/yr. The deposition rate dropped rapidly as diameters\nexceed 40 microns. Generally, the maximum spherule deposition occurred in\nthe spring and summer months.\nDole demonstrated that the thin cloud of dust particles concentrated\nin the space near the Earth may be due entirely to the gravitational attraction of the Earth. The velocities of most of the dust particles in space\nthat are eventually captured by the Earth were shown to be relatively low,\npermitting such concentration. Such particles, initially moving around the\nSun on direct orbits in the plane of the ecliptic can produce a steady-state\ndust cloud about the Earth. The calculated particle flux was found to vary\nwith the 1 6 power of the distance from the Earth\'s center, agreeing with\n.6\nsatellite observations. Individual dust particles were continually entering\nand leaving the dust cloud, but the concentrations remained constant over\ntime\n\n.\n\nDubin and McCylitcken presented a summary of measurements of interplanetary dust. The cumulaFive distribution curve of the influx rate of dust\nparticles as a function of particle mass may be described approximately by\nthe equation\nlog I = -17.0 -1.70 log m\ne\ne\n\'\n\'\nand m isthe mass in grams\nwhere I is the influx rate in particles m-2 s\nin the range from\ng < M < lom6 g. The spatial density of particles was\nestimated at 1X10-20 g e\'\nm.\nThe spatial density of dust particles near the\n&rth was approximately lo3 times greater than in interplanetary space. The\naccretion rate of interplanetary dust particles was about\ntons per day.\n\n42\n\n1962\nmatter\ngested\naround\nschein\n\nFesenkov described direct methods for determining the density of cosmic\nin interplanetary space. He obtained a higher value than that sugby studies of the zodiacal light. He suggested that the dust cloud\nthe Earth augments the influx of cosmic matter, and that the gegenphenomenon may be a manifestation of this cloud.\n\nGallant argues that there is no reason not to suppose the meteorites\nfell on the Earth before the "late Quaternary period,\'\' contrary to the views\nof Dingle (1961).\nHarwit showed that radiation pressures in space can account for the\nformation of certain groups of stars, and for the acceleration of interstellar\nclouds in the vicinity of hot stars and galactic nuclei.\nHodge discussed the interactions of the planet Mercury with interplanetary material. The space density of material at Mercury\'s distance from the\nSun is about three times that at the Earth\'s distance ( X . U . ) .\nHe adopted\nparticle orbits near Mercury of low inclination, low eccentricity, and primarily direct motion. He found about lo3 times the mass of incident material\nto be displaced by impact, and concluded that Mercury has been severely\neroded by interplanetary material. It is probably dust covered. If Mercury\nis assumed to have no appreciable atmosphere, about l o 4 g/sec of dust is\nejected from the planet, and should form a faint tail opposite the Sun.\nHrugka described the motion of a small meteoric particle in the atmosphere. Even if irregular, vertical motions of the air are present, the\nactual time of fall is not significantly different from that calculated under\nthe assumption of a stagnant atmosphere.\nKrivetsky, Bauer, Loucks, Padlog, Robinson, and Walters discussed\nmicrometeorites -as a part, of a review of the space invironment in connection\nwith zero-gravity expulsion techniques.\nKurt and Moroz examined the potential of a metal sphere in interplanetary space. The potential was shown to be within the limits -2.> to +4 volts,\nassuming an interplanetary gas temperature of lo4\' K. Appreciable negative\npotentials (up to kilovolts) are possible in the outer radiation belt.\nLevin maintained that the magnitude distribution of meteors is strongly\ninfluenced by fragmentation, so that estimates of mass distribution of meteors\nmust be revised.\nMagnolia compiled an extensive annotated bibliography on interplanetary\nmatter of all types. He lists a total of 1650 references.\nMar described meteoroid puncture experiments on the first Canadian\nsatellite. He concluded that during the first year of operation, there was\nonly a 15 percent chance that one meteoroid would penetrate the inner payload.\nExposed components, however, are susceptible to reasonable probability of\npenetration.\n\n43\n\n1962\n\nMason presented a general review of micrometeorites as part of a discussion of the entire subject of meteorites.\n\nMcCrosky and Sobegan described experiments with an artificial iron\nmeteoroid. A small, stainless steel pellet was accelerated from the nose of\na high-speed reentry rocket. The purpose of the experiment was to determine\nthe efficiency with which the kinetic energy of a meteoroid is transformed\ninto luminous energy in the photographic region. The beginning of luminosity\nis accompanied by vaporization from the surface of the pellet or by vaporization from small droplets thrown off from it. They deduced that initial mass\nloss was due to melting and spraying.\nMrkos collected particulate matter fromthe snow at Vostok Station,\nAntarctica. He described spectral analyses and reported iron, nickel, and\ncobalt, but gave no data. He concluded that many of the particles were of\ncosmic origin.\nMirtov summarized Soviet research on "solid interplanetary matter in\nits finely dispersed form (micrometeorites) . \' I The Soviets have recorded\ncollisions of satellites with particles of mass\ng to l - g, and have\no\'\nderived estimates of 5000 to 1 , 0 tons per day. They believe a dust cloud\n000\nexists around Earth, increasing in density toward its surface. They estimated\nthe maximum concentration of dust particles to be at a distance of about\n1 0 to 2 0 km from the Earth\'s surface.\n0\n0\nNeugebauer compiled references published since her earlier review.\n\n- briefly summarized knowledge on micrometeorites and micrometeoroids\nNew\nas a part of a survey on the dynamic environment of space.\nNewkirk and Eddy presented data obtained during high-altitude coronagraph observations.\nNewkirk and Eddy investigated the influx of meteor particles in the\nupper atmosphere by stratospheric coronagraph observations. They confirmed\nthe existence of an aerosol layer at approximately 65,000 feet. Most of these\nparticles are probably terrestrial in origin. Above this layer, the particle\nconcentration drops sharply, and it is assumed that a steady state occurs.\nNewkirk and Eddy, in another paper, gave a more general account of\ntheir high-altitude coronagraph experiments and an excellent description of\nthe equipment and techniques used.\nParkin, Hunter, and Brownlow described collections of atmospheric dust\non the Isles of Scilly during 1961. The concentration of metallic iron varied,\nand showed three main peaks. These may be correlated with the Arietids,\nB-Taurids, and Perseids meteor showers if the dust is allowed a delay of about\n3 weeks in falling fromthe upper atmosphere. This was in accord with Bowen\'s\n(1953) rainfall hypothesis. Iron-nickel and even pure nickel particles were\nobserved. Attachments were sometimes found adhering to the metal particles.\nThese were frothy cream color, with transparent nodular excrescences sprouting\n\n44\n\nfrom the surface. In the dry state it gave no indication of the Ni metal\nflake embedded in it. Refractive index of the transparent, amorphous material\nwas 1.547 to 1.540. This amorphous material might be partly organic, and\nwhere not charred by impinging on the atmosphere at high speed, may represent\ncosmic dust in its original state. A very nickel-rich flake of metal embedded\nin an amorphous material which had a refractive index of 1.549 was found in\nAntarctic melt water. In transmitted light it was a pale yellowish green, and\nin reflected light is appeared a frothy white or cream.\n\n1962 Parkin and Hunter reviewed the salient facts about meteorites in connection with a study of extraterrestrial dust particles. They concluded that\nthe dust particles were either meteoritic or meteoric in origin. They thought\nmeteoritic particles originated from planetary destruction followed by subsequent internal collisions among the fragments and ascribed meteoric particles\nto ablation of cometary meteors, especially principal meteor showers.\nParkin and Hunter described the apparatus and techniques employed in\ncollecting iron dust from the air, and presented the results of initial experiments. They found that the accretion rate of iron dust varies with meteoric\nactivity, and that the particles fell to Earth shortly after meteor showers.\nThis does not support Bowen\'s rainfall hypothesis, which requires a larger\ntime for particles to settle.\nSpherical particles were shown to be produced by the melting of minute\nmeteoritic fragments (and thus should be classed as micrometeorites). Ablation of meteorites, once thought to be the cause of spherules, cannot produce\nsufficient material to account for the annual spherule deposit.\nThe iron flakes collected were thought to originate through the evaporation of volatile ices from cometary meteors, freeing the flakes to the\nmeteor wake.\nWhile in space, the particles would be electrically charged which\nwould inhibit any influence upon the path of the particles by the Earth\'s\nmagnetic field. This would be especially true if the particles were traveling at meteoric speeds. However, if ionized interplanetary gas exists, there\nwould be strong interaction between the gas and the particles. The particles\nwould be brought to rest with respect to the gas, and drift with it, perhaps\nbecoming concentrated over the auroral zones of the Earth. (This process\nwould be aided if the particles traveled more slowly than at meteoric\nvelocities .)\nPskovski reviewed knowledge of dust in circumterrestrial space.\nRiggs, Wright, and Hodge reported chemical analyses of particles collected by high-altitude aircraft and balloons. They used an electron-probe\nX-ray microanalyzer. Unfortunately, only a few particles are thought to be\nof meteoric origin; most are apparently of artificial origin.\nRuskol discussed the origin of the concentration of dust around the\nEarth, based on satellite measurements. The concentration near the Earth was\n\n45\n\nfound to be lo5 times larger than the zodiacal cloud concentration. Most\nparticles are thought to be in orbit about the Earth. Whipple\'s suggestion\nthat particles are contributed by impacts on the Moon was discounted. Two\nmechanisms for concentration of dust particles near the Earth are proposed:\nneutral inelastic collisions and atmospheric deceleration. Neutral inelastic\ncollisions among dust particles causes loss of velocity by transfer of kinetic\nenergy into heat and deformation. This would account for the concentration at\n500 to 1 0 km altitude. Atmospheric decelerations cause dust velocities to\n00\ndecrease, causing the particles to fall to Earth. Maximum deceleration will\noccur in the region lOO-3OO km above the Earth\'s surface; explaning the concentration of dust particles observed there.\n\n1962 Salisbury, Van Tassel, and Adler compiled a bibliography of lunar and\nplanetary research published in 1961. A total of 265 references were included.\nShoemaker suggested that the particles discovered by Kordylewski near\nthe Earth-Moon triangular Lagrangian points may be ejecta from hypervelocity\nimpact on the Moon.\nSinger investigated the effects of solar radiation pressure and solar\ncorpuscular drag on zodiacal dust. Solar radiation pressure produces a force\nopposed to solar gravity, which leads to an appreciably lower circular orbital\nvelocity. A pronounced anisotropy in density distribution about the earth is\nproduced; should be higher in the evening. The solar corpuscular drag leads\nto a spiraling of dust particles toward the Sun if the interplanetary gas is\nstreaming outward fromthe Sun. If a gas cloud rotated with solar angular\nvelocity, the effect is in the opposite direction, and particles would spiral\noutward.\nSmith considered the problem of deposition in atmospheric diffusion of\nparticulate matter. He presented a mathematical development of the problem.\n\n0\nStorebb suggested that meteor particles down to 1 microns diameter\ncould initiate raindrops by colliding with cloud droplets.\nUtech reported cosmic spherules from lower Triassic sediments. The\nmain components of these particles were magnetite and olivine or bronzite.\nThese are thus older than the late Quaternary, contrary to the work of\nDingle (1961).\nValley reviewed data on space and planetary environment. Micrometeorites w h z h he mentioned only briefly will be the subject of a later survey.\nVolz and Good-yconducted measurements of the absolute intensity of\ntwilight in an attempt to derive quantitative data on dust concentrations in\nthe upper atmosphere. They found maximum dust concentrations near 20 km\nelevation, fewer amounts at higher altitudes, and a seasonal maxlmum during\nwinter months.\nWright and Hodge reported collections of extraterrestrial particles by\nhigh-flying aircraft. The mean space density of particles greater than\n3 microns diameter was 4,000 per m3 at 40,000 ft, and decreased to 1,000 per\nm3 at 87,000 ft. The space density of small spherical particles (cosmic dust)\n\n46\n\nwas 3 per m3 at 45,000 ft. The rate of fall of these particles was 0.3\nspherule/an2/day. About 2X108 kg of this kind of particle fell to the Earth\neach year.\nAlexander reported on studies of interplanetary dust in the triennium\nreport to the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. He\nsummarized both direct and indirect measurements bearing on particle composition, dynamic properties, and origin.\n\n@0-1963)\n\nAlexander and McCracken reviewed dust particle fluxes as determined by\nsatellite measurements.\nAlexander, McCracken, Secretan, and Berg reviewed direct measurements\nof interplanetary dust from satellites and probes. They established a cwnulag. The accretion of\ntive influx curve for particles between lo-" and\ninterplanetary matter by the Earth is dominated by small particles with masses\nless than 10-6 g. A conservative estimate of the accretion rate is l o 4 tons\nper day. The influx rates undergo large fluctuations, and some were correlated with meteor showers. The fluctuations suggest that dust particles are\nnot predominantly in long-lived orbits about the Earth.\n\n__ reviewed information available on meteoroids, giving particular\nAli\nattention to the meteoroid hazard to spacecraft.\nBaker described research into the velocity of faint meteors. A real\nseasonal variation in the observed velocity distribution of faint meteors was\ndiscovered. Despite this seasonal effect, the observations still seem to\nindicate a decrease in average velocity with magnitude.\n\n-Beard reviewed data on comets and cometary debris in the solar system.\nComets were described as icy conglomerates with low structural strength and\ndensity. As they approach the Sun, gases and dust are released, and the\ncomets become visible. Most cometary major axes are probably very much less\nthan those assumed to move in simple Keplerian orbits. On the average, about\n30 tons of cometary debris are ejected into the solar system each second;\nwhen this material encounters the earth\'s atmosphere, meteors are produced.\nMuch of this debris is removed by perturbing forces such as s o l a r rtidiatiori\npressure. The Fraunhofer component of the solar corona is a result of light\ndiffraction by micron-sized particles occurring in space. The concentration\nof particles in space near the Earth was estimated to be\nparticles\nGravitational attractions result in an enhancement of dust in the region of\nthe planets.\nBlack surveyed the space debris environment and hazards to spacecraft\nfrom that source.\nBowen reported that the radar meteor rate, rainfall, and freezing\nnucleus count all vary in a similar way with lunar phase.\nBoyle and Orrok considered the problem of penetration of spacecraft on\nthe lunar surface by lunar secondary meteoroids. They concluded that particles of the lunar surface dislodged by meteoroid impact have a low probability\nof penetration of spacecraft.\n\n47\n\nBrierley and Davies reported radar meteor rates which suggested a\nrelationship with lunar phase, similar to that found by Bowen (1963).\n\n1963\n\nCassidy reported on radioactivation analyses of cosmic dust. Only iron\nwas detected, with the exception of one glassy spherule which gave a remarkable similarity to average tektite composition.\nCassidy described experimental data bearing on questions of cosmic dust\ngenesis. From consideration of a part of the Fe-Mg-Si-0 system, it was concluded that a wide range of compositions in the Fe-FeO-MgO-SiOZ.\nsubsystem\nwould split into three mutually immiscible liquids at temperatures greater\n61\nthan 1 8 \' C k 2 O . F o r an appreciable range of composition three-liquid immiscibility may exist up to vaporous temperatures. Initial chemical segregation\nduring condensation of cosmic dust could be extreme.\nD\'Aiutolo described results of meteoroid penetration experiments with\nExplorer X V I . The data indicated that for thin metal sheets, meteoroid penetration may occur 1 to 1 0 times less frequently than has been assumed.\n0\n0\nD\'Aiutolo described satellite measurements of the meteoroid environment,\nas determined by Explorer X I\nV . The flux estimated as a result of penetrations\nin thin metallic sheets was much less than other satellite f l u x measurements.\nD\'Aiutolo reviewed the meteoroid environment based on satellite measurements with Explorers XI11 andXV1. These spacecraft carried several impact\nand penetration detectors to record encounters with meteoroids. On the\ne-.\nem thick aluminium had about lom6 penetrations m-2 se\'\nExplorer X V I ,\nThis rate was greater than that estimated by Watson-Bjork but less than estimated by Whipple or Charters and Summers. Explorer XVI data indicated a\nlower dust frequency near Earth than reported by earlier workers. These\nresults indicated a penetration frequency essentially identical with estimates\nof particle concentration in interplanetary space. It may be possible to\ndesign spacecraft with less shielding against meteoroid impact.\nDavidson and Herbach considered the dispersion of clusters of particles\nin the atmosphere. They reported that two important physical processes contribute to separation, turbulence, and varying terminal velocities. They\nfound deposition to be dependent only on the logarithm of the ratio of the\nmedian terminal velocity to the friction velocity, and on the coefficient of\nvariation of the terminal velocity distribution.\nDonn and Sears applied crystal growth theory to the formation of\nparticles from the primordial solar nebula. The particles are expected to\ngrow as filaments and thin platelets. Such particles, upon collision, would\nform loosely packed "fairy castle" or "lint ball" structures of low density.\nSuch particles would facilitate successive aggregation into planets, comets,\nand asteroids. The difficulties associated with the aggregation of spherical\nsmoke particles would be avoided.\n\n48\n\nI\n\nDonn discussed the origin and nature of solid particles in space. He\nreviewed the paper by Donn and Sears, on the origin of particles in space and\ncompared the source and sample material to direct sampling programs for these\nmaterials.\n\n1963\n\nDubin examined the effects of meteoroid impacts on space exploration.\nFollowing a review of data on meteoroids and cosmic dust, he presented estimates of expected impact rates as a function of mass. For a density of\nand velocity of 30 km se\'\ne-,\nhe calculated an "effective expectation\n2 g\nof impact frequency" by meteoroids. This shows that the flux of meteoroids\nwhich could prove a hazard to spacecraft is considerably less than early\nestimates. Relatively long exposure times over extended surface areas would\nbe required to obtain experimental data in the space environment.\nDubin, Alexander, and Berg described satellite measurements of cosmic\ndust which indicate large fluctuations in flux. In addition to daily variations, periods of greater flux appear to be associated with cosmic dust\nstreams. A stream was detected beginning February 2, 1958, although it does\nnot correspond to any known annual meteor shower. A second dust stream was\napparently related to the Leonid meteor shower.\nFechtig and Utech reported on X-ray and laboratory experiments with\nmicrometeorites and meteoritic iron. They examined spherules from the\nAlbatross expedition and German oil wells and prepared samples of meteoritic\niron and artificial Ni-Fe alloy which showed oxidation zones similar to those\nshown by the natural spherules.\nFechtig and U t a described spherules recovered from sediments collected during the Albatross Expedition. They examined polished surfaces of\nspherules, and discovered that some had an acentrally located nickel-rich\n"core," surrounded by iron oxide (magnetite). Many spherules had no cores,\nand they postulated that the cores had been dissolved. They concluded that\nspherules need not contain nickel to be considered cosmic in origin. An\nexperiment with an iron meteorite yielded apparent concentration of nickel\ntoward the interior of the body. They concluded that the smaller a meteorite\ngets by ablation, the higher its concentration of nickel. Furthermore, they\nregarded the nucleii of spherules as a birth scar or navel with which the\nspherules had been connected to its mother substance until final separation.\nFredriksson and Gowdy reported studies of meteoritic debris from the\nSouthern California desert. Electron probe analyses of many spherules\nrevealed two of probable meteoritic origin. These were attributed to a cosmic\norigin.\nFredriksson and Martin discussed the origin of black, magnetic spherules from various sources. On the basis of electron probe analyses of\npolished surfaces of spherules they concluded that many particles found in\ndeep sea sediments and on Pacific islands may be of volcanic origin. The\nparticles gave positive results for Fe, Ti, and Mn, but showed little or no\nNi or Co. Estimates of the accretion rate of cosmic particles derived by\n\n4\n9\n\n. .\n\n...\n..\n\n- ... .. . ._\n\n.\n\n-\n\n...\n..\n\ncounting black spherules are likely to be uncertain, because of the difficiency in nickel of many particles. Hollow spherules are likely to be of\nvolcanic origin.\n\n1963 Fesenkov studied the fragments resulting from the 1908 impact of the\nTungus meteorite in Siberia. The retrograde motion of the body, the strong\naerial explosion, wide distribution of debris, lack of fragments or craters at\nthe site of explosion, and anomalous light scattering shortly following the\nevent suggest that it was a small comet rather than a met.eorite.\nGault described hy-pervelocity impact experiments which indicate that\ninterplanetary debris impacting on the Moon causes lunar material to be\ninjected into space. Trajectories indicate that much material escaping the\nlunar gravitational field is hurled into geocentric orbits; this material\npresumably contributes to the Earth\'s dust cloud and eventually may be deposited on the Earth\'s surface. Terrestrial accretion of lunar material appears\nto be a continuous process and a means of obtaining lunar samples fromthe\nEarth.\nGiese reviewed models of interplanetary matter derived from scattering\n.\nof the zodiacal light. A model for light scattering by small (< 0 2 microns),\nspherical solid particles by Rayleigh-like scattering and without contributions from electons accounts for both the brightness and polarization observed\nin zodiacal light. Further models describing scattering functions of nonspherical partikles, similar to those collected by sounding rockets, are\nneeded to provide additional information on the problem.\nGraziano and M s C o r m G compiled an annotated bibliography on the meteoroid hazard to space vehicles and listed a total of 78 references.\nGreenberg reviewed data on interstellar grains which were obtained\nfrom astronomical or astrophysical sources.\nGreenman described heat annealing experiments on Venus Fly-Trap particles. Diffraction spots distinct from the substrate and likely contamination\nappeared after heat treatment.\nGrjebine reported on collections of dust particles made by means of\nradioactive fallout detectors in metropolitan France. It was estimated that\n2.4~109metric tons of such dust are deposited on the Earth each year. If\nthis rate had continued for 3X109 years, a layer about 7 km thick would have\nbeen deposited, which is about the depth of the Mohorovicic discontinuity\nbeneath the oceans.\nGrjebine reported on collections of dust particles made in France by\nradioactive debris collectors and air filters. If the average iron content\nis assumed constant for all cosmic dust samples, cosmic dust can be detected\nby a "magnetic weight" method. This method yielded an estimate for annua.1\naccretion of 2.4X109 metric tons per year. Relatively uniform results were\nfound for several sites in a large network. Possible sample contamination\nfrom eolian pollution and industrial sources was considered negligible. The\ndensity of cosmic dust in the air is variable, and higher concentrations were\n\nI\n\nfound by ocean ships than land stations. The rate of fall of particles\nthrough the atmosphere is so fast that no transport of dust is likely. The\nsimilarity in peaks of particle influx observed at the same time at several\nplaces, by different investigators suggests that dust is introduced to the\natmosphere on a world-wide scale.\nGrjebine, Lalou, Ros, and Capitaut studied mmgnetic spherules from\nsediments of the Mediterranean Sea. The particles were magnetically separated\nfrom dispersed sediment and examined microscopically. Several types of particles were recognized: shiny black spherules, slaggy black spherules, two\ntypes of brown spherules, transparent spherules, and white spherules. Some\nhollow spherules were found, as well as some which had a "shiny nucleus." In\ngeneral, fewer spherules were found in coarser sediments. There was no systematic correlation between the occurrence of spherules and amounts of Fe, Ni,\nand M in the sediment. They reported qualitative electron microprobe analyn\nses and concluded that the particles are of cosmic origin.\n\n1963\n\nHarwit discussed the origins of the zodiacal dust cloud. Much of the\ndust emitted by comets was shown to be soon lost because the Sun\'s radiation\npressure pushes the grains out of the solar system. The adequacy of present\nmodels of the zodiacal cloud to explain the observed concentration of dust\nwas examined. Comets are unlikely to provide dust at a rate comparable to\nPoynting-Robertson losses. Asteroids may supply dust, but the supply must\nbe highly variable, and the zodiacal cloud cannot be in a steady state. The\npresent epoch would then have to be one of unusually high dust density.\nHarwit examined the possible origins of interplanetary dust. An asteroidal origin was found to be incompatible with a steady-state interplanetary\ncloud. Interstellar dust could be captured by the solar system from accretion\nor by s o l a r radiation pressure. Neither of these mechanisms could be important at the Sun\'s present speed with respect to the interstellar medium.\nHastings described the Explorer XVI micrometeoroid satellite, which\ncarried several different experiments, including pressurized cells, wire\ngrids, cadmium sulfide detectors, and sounding boards.\nHastings gave preliminary results for the Explorer X V I satellite. Data\nindicated that the rate of puncture vas intermediate between the lowest and\nhighest estimated rates. Solar cells were degraded by space erosion less than\n14 percent.\nHastings reported on continued micrometeorite experiments with\nExplorer X I\nV . The puncture rates remained the same as in the previous period.\nHawkins discussed meteorite impacts on the ~ a r t h\nandMoon. Although 9\nout 1 meteorites are stony, the larger objects which collide with the Earth\n0\nmay be predominantly iron. It was assumed that rates for the surface of the\nk o n are 1/2 of the rates for the Earth. He concluded that the nearapproaching asteroids are iron objects, although the bulk of material in the\nasteroid zone may be nonmetallic. The m a x i m size of object to collide with\nthe Earth was estimated at loL7 kg; for the Moon, 1 l kg.\n06\n\n51\n\n-- o J w r h\ndescribed radar meteor results bearHawkins, Lindblad,- and S u & o t\ning on the velocity of faint meteors. They found a systematic change in\naverage velocity which depends on magnitude and thus on size. Smaller particles have lower velocities. There were indications that the change becomes\nmore pronounced for the fainter meteors. The average decrease was about\n5 -km see-1. for 3 magnitudes. The effect was attributed to the difference in\norbits between the various meteor populations.\n1963\n\n~\n\nHawkins reviewed principal facts about "the meteor population."\nAlthough average-sized meteorites are usually stones, very large meteorites\nare usually irons. The distribution laws for each are consistent with the\nhypothesis that meteorites are asteroidal fragments. Particles with mass\nand lo2 g are predominantly derived from the icy nucleus of a\nbetween\ncomet. About 50 percent of the meteor flux comes from major streams, the rest\nfrom sporadic meteors. Cometary meteors are extremely fragile, and small\nparticles investigated by radar techniques show fragmentation. In general,\nsmaller particles suggest lower velocity. No evidence was found to support\nthe myriad showers postulated by Eshelman and Gallagher (1962). Micrometeorites have a maximum diameter of about 4 microns at 15 km sec-l velocity and\n0\nThe probability of particles impacting with\nan over-all density of 3 g\nspacecraft is "trivially small.\nEquations for mass distribution of the several-sized particles were\ndeveloped.\n\n1 Stone meteorites:\n.\nloglo N = - . 3\n07\n2.\n\nIron meteorites:\nloglo N =\n\n-\n\nloglo\n\nITI\n\n-3.51- 0.7 loglo m\n\n3.

Bright objects are probably solid fragments, while faint objects are\nthought to have low strength and density. A direct relation of mean height to\nvelocity of radar meteors was discovered. The height decreases for faint\nmeteors. The relationship was interpreted as follows: bright meteors continuously shed fragments as they pass through the atmosphere, and behave somewhat\nas a single body. Larger meteoroids are fragile, and particles are given off\nearly in the trajectory. Fainter meteors, however, disintegrate completely at\nthe beginning of the trajectory, possibly because these meteoroids are so\nsmall. The number of fragments is almost independent of the mass of\n52\n\nI\n\nmeteoroid, suggesting that the fragments may be unequal in size, and many\nsma.ller fragments do not contribute to total ionization.\n\n1963 Hemenway,_.Soberman, and Witt described collections of particles from\nnoctilucent clouds. This short note was a preliminary account of the investigation.\n~~\n\nIngham reviewed knowledge of interplanetary matter. Most of interplanetary matter was considered to be particles of about 0.3 microns radius\ndensity. The zodiacal light was assumed to be caused by the scatand 3g\ntering of sunlight by dust particles. Many smaller particles were thought to\nbe involved in light scattering, rather than few larger ones. While spherical\nparticles were assumed in calculations, many grains are probably irregular.\nThe Earth\'s dust cloud may be comprised of particles too small to survive the\nforces of radiation pressure in interplanetary space. The gegenschein was\nthought to be caused by reflection of sunlight from dust particles in the\nEarth\'s cloud being drawn out in a tail opposite the Sun. Dust particles in\nspace may be of cometary and/or asteroidal origin.\nJacchia discussed the interrelationships between meteors, meteorites,\nand comets. He reviewed the history or" research in this area and described\nthe "present-day picture:" Meteor streams are formed by particles ejected\nalong comet orbits. Meteor streams are dispersed by a number of perturbing\nforces: gravitational attractions, Poynting-Robertson effect, solar radiation, and drag from interplanetary medium. Physical characteristics of meteor\nshowers suggest that the meteors are fragile, and that strength is relatable\nto orbital character and age of the stream. Brighter meteors are caused, at\nleast in part, by asteroidal fragments.\nJiusto and Eadie examined the terminal fall velocity of radar chaff.\nThey presented a theoretical development of forces on such particles, based\non a circular cylinder. Terminal velocity was found to be approximately\n\n[(&)\n\nVt\n\nz\n\nPcg]0\'73\n\ndl.19\n\n- =\n\n$0.46\n\npa0.27\n\nwhere\n\nPC\n\ncylinder density\n\nPa\n\nair density\n\nd\n\ncylinder diameter\n\ng\n\ngravitational acceleration\n\nP\n\ndynamic viscosity\n\nGraphs of this function versus height were given.\n\n53\n\n1963\n\nKaiser examined the distribution of interplanetary particles: Satellite data yield a different distribution function than meteor, accretion, and\nzodiacal light data, and suggest higher spatial densities of smaller particles.\nA cloud of particles in geocentric orbits, probably resulting by capture from\nthe zodiacal cloud, is postulated.\nKaiser reviewed data on meteors and the abundance of interplanetary\nmatter, Photographic and radar observations of meteors were described. Photographic data suggest that there is a maximum meteor rate in the morning,\nand, in the northern hemisphere, at the autumal equinox. Radio studies suggest that the faint shower meteors are "swamped" by the sporadic background.\nParticles small enough to radiate energy rapidly enough to prevent atmospheric ablation can survive to settle on the Farth. In addition, ablation\nproductsoflarger bodies may also settle on the Earth. Studies of this material provide insight into the character of interplanetary dust. Estimated\ninflux rates are greater than would be expected if all particles came from\nfragmentation of meteoroids.

Size distributions of collected\nparticles are in accord with gravitational attraction and atmospheric deceleration. Particles probably are responsible for the zodiacal light. Rocket and\nsatellite measurements of solid particles yielded estimates of the flux and\nspace density of interplanetary dust. Bright meteors are produced by conglomerate meteoroids somewhat less than 1 mm in diameter. Fainter telescopic and\nradar meteoroids are produced by compact particles. Particles less than 0.3\nmicron radius are removed from the solar system by radiation pressure. The\nevidence is in favor of a dust cloud about the Earth.\n\n54\n\nmeteoric\nKeay described\nradar\n1963confirmed that theaspatialsurvey o f of small,\nwas\ndensity\n\nactivity in New Zealand.

In other words, northern hemisphere stations showed a maximum of\nmeteor rates in the summer months (June, July, August) while southern hemisphere stations showed a maximum in the winter months (December, January). The\ncombined effects of the Earth\'s axial tilt and the asymmetrical meteor distribution along the Earth\'s orbit are apparently responsible for the observed\neffects\n\n.\n\nLaGow and Secretan presented the results of micrometeoroid experiments\non the Explorer VI1 satellite. It was concluded that one penetration through\none cell occurred, and that it was caused by a particle approximately\n1 microns in diameter.\n0\nLangway investigated extraterrestrial dust in snow deposits at Camp\nCentury, Greenland. Although perfect spheres were most common in the smaller\nsize ranges (< 40 microns), droplet and oval forms were present, particularly\nin the larger particles. A large proportion of the spherules were hollow.\nTranslucent and transparent spherules were also present, but most attention\nwas devoted to black spherules. Surface features of these ranged from smooth\nand shiny to rough and dull. Density determinations revealed that most spherules were hollow; density ranged from 4.27 to 5.90 g emm3. Spherules size\nranged from 5 to 160 microns indiameter. Electron probe analyses of particle\nsurfaces revealed two class s of particles; iron-rich and silicon-rich particles, The data suggest a possible correlation between variations in spherule\noccurrence with yearly snow layers.\nLangway and Marvin compared the chemical and physical properties of\nblack spherules collected fromthe Greenland ice sheet with industrial weld\nspatter particles. Diameters of the Greenland spherules range from 5 to\n230 microns. The spherules lacked an obvious tarnish or oxidized crust. Weld\nspatter spherules had many morphological similarities with the Greenland\nspherules. Electron probe analyses of spherule surfaces show the Greenland\nspherules contain mainly Fe, Mn, and Si. Weld spatter spherules showed a wide\nrange in composition. Mineralogical studies and density measurements were\nalso performed. The composition and density of weld spatter particles was\ndistinct from spherules. Although the Greenland spherules did not appear to\norigin.\ncontain Ni, it was felt that they are of COSPILC\nI;ars-on,Dwomik, and Adler described electron probe analyses of cosmic\ndust from several sources.\n__ -~\nLazarus and Hawkins examined the ionizing probability for sodium atoms\nevaporated from the surface of a meteoroid entering the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nThe estimated meteor mass suggested an upward revision of the meteor mass\nscale.

Predictions of the model are in harmony with the observed data for the sodium content in the Earth\'s atmosphere.\n\nMarshall investigated the stratigraphic distribution of particulate\nmatter smaller than 15 microns diameter in snow from Byrd Station, Antarctica.\nPreliminary results suggested that fewer particles were found in winter layers\nthan in summer layers, and that the particle deposition rate varied throughout\na year. He suggested that the study of particulate matter throughout the\nAntarctic ice sheet would make stratigraphic correlation between widely varying environments possible.\nMcCracken and Alexander compared direct measurements of small interplanetary dust particles with new data from sensors on satellite 1960 Xi. The\nnewer data agreed with previous work, and from thfs an average distribution\ncurve for small interplanetary dust\'particles in the vicinity of Earth was\nestablished. This showed "no discernible dependence on altitude Gf the spatial density of dust particles," and the postulated "dust belt" around the\nEarth was not supported by this work. The accretion rate of these particles\non Earth was estimated to be about 1 , 0 tons per day.\n000\nMcCracken and Dubin discussed dust bombardment on the lunar surface.\nFollowing a review of observational data available for the vicinity of the\nEarth and for interplanetary space, they estimated the flux of dust particles\nfor particles with masses less\non the Moon. An accretion rate of 1 g\n0\nthan 1 " g impacting on the Moon was adopted. A porous, low-density surface\nlayer 1 cm to 1 mthick was assumed to exist on the Moon. This would act as\n0\na protective covering against impacts of small dust particles, and inhibit\nproduction of high-speed spray particles which could escape from the Moon.\nThe surface layer thus consists of a mixture of lunar and interplanetary\nmaterial.\nMead, Chao, and Littler gave results of a study of the mineralogy,\ntexture, and chemical composition of metallic spheroids from Meteor Crater,\nArizona. Some spheroids had a kamacite core, commonly intergrown and surrounded with goethite, while others consisted of alternating bands of goethite\nand maghemite. Electron probe analyses showed the following:\nMineral\nKamac ite\nMaghemite\nGoethite\n\nNi, percent\n2-25\n\nFe, percent\n72-97\n\n4-7\n\n60-67\n\n2-2\n\n52-60\n\nThe wide range of nickel content , the fine-grained texture, and the siliceous\nglass coating suggested that the spheroids probably condensed from a vapor or\nmelt produced during impact of the meteorite.\n\n1963\n\nMelton described collections of particles from the upper atmosphere.\n\nA D C - 8 aircraft was employed for collecting particles from 36,000 to 41,000\nfeet. Preliminary results indicated that some particles appeared to be of\nmeteoritic origin.\nMerrihue analyzed rare gases from dust particles in Pacific red clay.\nHe detected He3 and argon of cosmic origin in the magnetic separate, indicating an extraterrestrial origin for probably less than 1 percent of this\nmaterial. It is possible that the solar wind could have implanted the cosmic\ngases in grains of cosmic dust; they were not of cosmogenic origin.\nMillard developed a model for meteorite recovery based on known falls\nand population data. He concluded that the average minimum meteorite flux\ndensity for 1810-1950 was about 1 1 tO.4 falls per 1 " k per year, and that\n.\n0 $\nthe average distance between the point of fall and the person who eventually\npicked up the meteorite was 0 1 km. He estimated an approximate yearly value\n.2\nof 15 falls per 1 6 km?.\n0\nMillard and Brown investigated yearly and monthly time-of-fall patterns\nfor all meteorite falls. The number of falls have three and possibly four\nmaxima. Monthly fall patterns for veined olivine-hypersthene chondrites\nappear to be nonrandom. The study of meteoric time-of-fall patterns resulted\nin no definite conclusions as to the types of orbits followed by meteorites,\nand their origins are no less secure.\nMitler examined the amount of He3 in planetesimals (solid, homogeneous\nspheres of ice and silicate). He calculated the productim and concentration\ne\nof He3 resulting from bombardment by prehistoric solar protons. H found that\nthe presently observed terrestrial isotopic ratios can be obtained only if the\nHe3 concentration in the "skin" of planetesimals never rose above 6600 per lo6\nsilicon atoms. The maximum found was about 500.\nMoroz discussed the Earth\'s dust envelope. He reviewed the observational data, and described the apparent decrease in dust concentration with\ndistance from the Earth. He examined several hypotheses for the origin of\nthe dust concentration but perferred to believe that particles originate by\nfragmentation of larger bodies "by some mechanism which has not yet been\nidentified.\nh t c h collected dust particles from Paleozoic salts. He found several\ntypes of particles, one of which appeared likely to be meteoritic, by X-ray\nand ore microscopy.\nMutch collected magnetic spherules of extraterrestrial origin from\nSilurian rock salt from New York. The majority of spherules had a slightly\nroughened brownish surface. Others were black, perfectly spherical, had a\nmetallic luster, and were composed principally of magnetite. Sizes ranged\nfrom 5 to 250 microns.\n\n57\n\n1963\n\nNazarova described experiments to detect dust with satellites. She\nsummarized both American and Soviet data, which suggest that dust is concentrated at heights of 1 0 to 300 km above the Earth\'s surface.\n0\nNazarova, Bektabegov, and Komissarov described detection of meteoric\n..\nmaterial on the Mars 1 probe. The probe encountered the Taurid meteor stream,\nwhich yielded an average frequency of impacts at 7X10-3 m-z see-1 , an unusually high rate. The space density of meteoric bodies in the stream was\nextremely uneven. Few impacts were received at about 23 million km from the\nEarth. However, from 23-45 million km from the earth, a high density of\nmeteoric matter was again encountered. It was proposed that this was a\nmeteor stream which has not yet been identified. Again, the distribution of\nmeteoroids was uneven.\nPark and Reid made a comparative study of metallic spherules. They\nanalyzed material from the Arizona meteor crater, Pacific Ocean sediment, Gulf\nof Mexico sediment, and a variety of slags. Spherules f r o m deep sea sediments\nwere oxidized and contained less than 1 percent nickel. Gulf of Mexico spherules were thought to be terrestrial. No nickel was found in slag material.\nPeterson discussed further thermal radiation from interplanetary dust.\nThe infrared emission spectral distributions of the interplanetary dust cloud\nwere considered according to several models. The gradient of emitted intensity provided no clear means of discriminating between space density laws if\nlarge albedos are considered.\nPeterson described a model for the emission of thermal radiation by the\ninterplanetary dust, and its possible role in the phenomenon of reddening of\nthe solar corona. Inclusion of a thermal emission component in coronal intensity brings observed and predicted reddening into good agreement for all\nobservations. Thermal radiation intensities from interplanetary dust are\npredicted to exceed the scattered radiakion intensities in the near infrared.\nHe suggested experiments to verify the existence of this thermal component in\nthe solar corona.\n\nRay described the motion of charged particles in the geomagnetic field.\nThe treatment is essentially that of StErmer (1955), with the innovation that\nthe field not be required to have axial symmetry in order for the Stsrmer\nintegral to be exact. The treatment was used to obtain results for trapped\nparticles and cosmic rays, but can be adapted to other situations.\nRuskol discussed the origin of the interplanetary dust cloud around\nthe Earth. Rocket and satellite measurements indicate a concentration of dust\nparticles in the space near the Earth. In particular, the concentration from\nloo-300 km is more than lo5 times greater than the zodiacal cloud. He argued\nthat these particles could not come from the Moon as Whipple suggested.\nInelastic collisions between particles cause them to be captured by the Earth.\nAtmospheric decelerations also contribute to the concentration.\nSafronov formulated a restricted solution to the accretion equation.\nHe concluded that one half the mass of the Earth during the final stage of its\n\ngrowth was contributed by bodies larger than the Moon. However, fragmentation\nof colliding bodies leads to an increase In the mass contributed by small\nparticles.\nSalisbury, Van Tassel, Adler, and Dodd compiled a bibliography of lunar\nand planetary research published during 1962. They listed a total of 450\nreferences.\n\n1963\n\nSauval discussed the consequences of collisions between West Ford\nneedles and micrometeorites. While uncertainties are present, the data suggest that each needle will be struck more than once by a micrometeoroid and\nwill break at least once during the initially predicted eight year lifetime\nof the belt of needles.\nSauval reported on the belt of West Ford needles. He described the\nWest Ford needles, belts of orbiting dipoles used as passive c " c t o\noiain\nsatellites, in relation to other types of cmunication satellites and presents their advantages. In an extensive, comprehensive report he described\nthe formation of the belt of dipoles by dispersion from a satellite, functioning of the belt for communication, effects of the dipoles on other scientific\nactivities (negligible), perturbations of the belt, and preliminary results\nof the experiment.\nSchaeffer, Thompson, and Megrue described experiments to test the\npresence--of cosmogenic nuclides in ocean sediments. Analyses of ocean cores\nfor C136, He3, Ne2=, and A 3\nr \' were made, with negative results, which places\nan upper limit on the rate of accumulation of extraterrestrial material in\nthe deep ocean basins.\n\nSchmidt compiled a survey of data on microscopic extraterrestrial\nparticles. It included works published up to the end of 1962.\nSchmidt described dust particles collected from snows of the Antarctic\nPeninsula. He found both metallic and glassy particles. The metallic particles consisted of magnetite, primarily; the glassy particles were somewhat\nakin to tektites. The frequency of occurrence was directly related to snow\naccumulation, and spherule size was inversely related to accumulation. He\nfound no correlation of spherules in annual layers among stations. He estimated the annual mass accretion to be about lX105 metric tons for the entire\nEarth.\nSchmidt, Vemataraman, Jackson, and Woollard examined the surface\nfeatures of metallic spherules with an electron microscope. They found three\ntypes of particles: smooth particles, pitted particles, and "ridged and\nfurrowed" particles. The latter two types were thought to have resulted from\nspace erosion, the surface features being preserved by atmospheric entry at\nlow angles of incidence and/or low velocity.\nShapiro described a new method for investigating micrometeoroid fluxes:\nSeveral long, thin, metallic wires would be orbited and monitored by radar.\nDust particle fluxes would be determined from the increase in the number of\nseparate fragments.\n\n59\n\n1963\n\nShapiro, Lautx-3\nand C-qlgmbo investigated a mechanism for capturing\ncosmic dust into long-lifetime Earth orbits: Particles approaching the Earth\non hyperbolic paths with small impact parameters pass through the atmosphere\nf\nand lose enough energy to be captured. I the approach trajectories are\nsuitably oriented, then sunlight pressure increases perigees of captured particles to allow survival up to thousands of revolutions. The number of\ntrapped particles can be increased by the drag, which may cause fragile particles to break up. The capture mechanism is effective mainly forvelocities "at\ninfinity" between 0 and 5 km seem1 and for initial closest approach altitudes\nof between l5O and 250 km.\nShapiro, Maron, and Kraft described an experimental study of charge\ndrag on orbiting dipoles. Charge drag has not produced a decrease in mean\naltitude at an average rate greater than 0.3 km/yr and may be actually less.\nAn upper limit of 0 6 volt for average electrostatic potential of the dipoles\n.\nwas established by making assumptions about the nature of the plasma.\nShelton discussed factors influencing the rate of meteoroid impact on\na satellite.\nShelton, Stern, and Hale considered the isotropy of the meteoroid distribution in the vicinity of the Earth in relation to the impact rate on\nspacecraft. Flux was defined as the total particle path length traced out\nthrough a unit volume at the point of interest, during unit time. Application\nof the Liouville theorem to the problem of focusing of meteoroids by the Earth\nprovided a mathematical basis for treatment of meteoroid distribution.\nSinger discussed the distribution of dust in cislunar space: The\ngravitational field leads to a modest increase in dust concentration near the\nEarth, but to an increase in flux of 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. A dust belt\nis formed with a maximum at 21 km.\nSinger discussed forces on dust and needles in the magnetosphere of the\nEarth: Small bodies moving in the magntosphere are affected by minor forces,\nradiation pressure and coulomb drag. These forces can cause important orbit\nperturbations. For large area to mass ratios, radiation pressure will distort\nthe orbits of incoming interplanetary dust and create a diurnal asymmetry.\nRadiation pressure will seriously affect lifetime in a satellite orbit through\na "resonance effect." If electric charge is large, then resonance is spciled\nby coulomb drag.\nSoberman discussed noctilucent clouds, and described the apparatus and\ntechniques for sampling particles in the clouds.\nSoberman and Della Lucca studied particulate impacts upon detectors\ncarried on satellite 1960 Zeta I. Most of the particles were found to be\nabout 5 microns in diameter. Apparently, no particles larger than 1 microns\n0\nwere detected. The data suggested that there is a geocentric variation in the\nmicrometeorite flux.\n\n60\n\n1961\n\nSob-eer-gan and Skrivanek described particle collections from noctilucent\nclouds. Particle counts 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater were found by a\nrocket which penetrated a cloud than by one which did not. The particles from\nthe cloud appeared to be surrounded by a ring of structure which suggested\nthat the particles were ice coated.\nSouthworth commented on Dole\'s paper, which concluded that particles\nwould be gravitationally concentrated by the Earth. He pointed out that\nDole\'s mechanism does not enhance the particle density near the Earth by more\nthan 12 percent in the most favorable case. Only 0.5 percent of photographic\nmeteors and less than 0.5 percent of smaller particles are amenable to the\ngravitational process. He concluded that the effect of gravitational concentration is negligible.\nSouthworth discussed the size distribution of zodiacal particles.\nSolar radiation will destroy particles less than about O . l A . U . from the sun.\nThe density of the zodiacal cloud will vary roughly as r-l from r\n0 1 to\n.\nr = 0.5 for comets or r\n3 for asteroids. The Fraunhofer corona (light\ndiffracted by small particles between the Earth and the Sun) is redder than\nthe Sun. Adopting these space density distributions, the average particle\nradius (weighted by particle area) is 1 5 microns or more. Approximately\n99 percent of all cometary particles have radius X density exceeding\n0 0 1 g cm-2.\n.0\n\n-\n\nUtech described the occurrence of cosmic spherules in rock salt and\nsediment cores. He compared the concentration of spherules larger than\n75 p-diameter in 1 0 gram increments of sample with a broad picture of the\n0\nlithographic character of individual sediment layers. Assuming that sediments\nof different type formed at different rates, he concluded that the fall of\ncosmic spherules upon the Earth was constant over a long period of time. He\nsuggested that spherule concentration in sediments could be used to determine\nrates of sedimentation, as a "natural clock."\nUtech and Fechtig gave an interpretation of the mechanics of origin of\ncosmic spherules. They favored an origin by ablation of iron meteorites.\nTerrestrial weathering removes nickel-iron nuclei from spherules deposited\non the Earth in pretertiary times, while recent spherules show such nuclei.\nThus, they thought the presence or absence of nickel was not indicative of\norigin. Similar spherules were obtained in laboratory experiments with\nartificial materials.\nWasson considered the radioactivity in interplanetary dust in terms of\nproduction, astrophysical relationships, geophysical relationships, sampling,\nand measurement. The most abundant radioactivities in the dust are produced\nby solar protons. Low-energy proton reactions on highly abundant target\nnuclides such as Si28 and Fe56 account for most radioactivities. The most\nabundant radioactive nuclides having half-lives longer than a few hours in\ndust of chondritic composition are Co5", F5,\ne\'\nA126, Mn53, C "\no,\nC14, Na22,\nand Co57. He proposed measuring the ratios of artificial and natural radioactivities to determine dust parameters. Poynting-Robertson and corpuscular\ndrag forces could be determined by measuring nuclide ratios in various size\n\n61\n\nfractions of the dust. The fraction of dust vaporized during atmospheric,,\nentry could be estimated by nuclide ratios. He proposed that A126 and M\nn\nbe measured in dust from ocean sediment and polar ice samples.\nWhipple described the erosion rates on the surfaces of meteoroids in\nspace. Based on photographic meteor studies and cosmic ray ages, the upper\nlimit of the erosion rate of nickel-iron meteorites in space was estimated at\nl.2X10-7 em yr-l. The similar value for stony meteorites was 1.7x10-6 em y.\nr\n\'\nThe rate for photographic meteoroids was 2 3 1 \' /\n.X05p\nem y-.\nr\'\nErosion rate was\nthought to depend in some inverse fashion upon the strength or brittleness of\nthe materials, which would be expected if erosion were produced by impacts\nwith interplanetary dust. The mean space density was estimated at roughly\n10-21 g em-3. The Poynting-Robertson effect can cause only the very smallest\ncometary meteoroids to spiral into the Sun if the present argument is valid.\nThe dust concentration near the Earth suggests that erosion rates may be\ngreater there than in deep space.\n\n1963\n\nWhipple revised his 1957 estimate of meteoroid penetration of space\nvehicles. He directed attention to photographic meteors, "which certainly\nmust be of cometary origin." He adopted a meteoroid density of 0.44 g em-,\nand a mass of 1 g for zero-magnitude visual meteor of velocity 30 km sec-l.\nHe estimated meteor influx as a function of mass to correspond to the relation\nlog N = -1.34 log m\n\n+ 2.68\n\nlog(O.&4/p)\n\n-\n\n14.48\n\nwhere Tl\n!\nis the cumulative number of meteoroids per second striking a surface\nof lm2, randomly oriented in space near the Earth, m is mass, and p is\ndensity. Only smallest particles were thought to be appreciably concentrated\ne-,\nin the space near the Earth. He adopted a mean velocity of 22 km s e \'\nalthough he pointed out that mean velocity probably decreases with decreased\nmeteoroid mass. He reduced the calculated perforation rate on a 0.1 em thick\nA1 plate in the Earth\'s neighborhood by a factor of more than 3000 from his\n1957 estimate. Possibly an unobserved, large flux rate in the mass range\n10-3 to 10-7 gram may exist.\nWitt, Hemenway, and Soberman reported on particles collected from the\nmesopause (75-95 km) by sounding rockets: Particle counts were two to three\norders of magnitude greater associated with the presence of noctilucent\nclouds. Electron microprobe analyses gave evidence of particles containing\nboth Fe and Ni. The numbers of particles per unit area and the size distributions were in agreement with observed light scattering properties of\nnoctilucent clouds.\n\n- reviewed the state of knowledge on the physics and chemistry of\nWood\nmeteorites. He presented an extensive summary of data on the physical properties, chemical composition, mineralogy, petrography, and metallography,\nclassification, and origin of meteorites.\nWright, Hodge, and Langway reported electron probe analyses of the\n1\nsurfaces of 1 8 extraterrestrial particles. Eight types of particles were\nrecognized from their shapes and composition: iron-rich spherules with\n\n62\n\nnickel; iron-rich spherules without nickel; silicon-rich spherules; other\nspherules; iron-rich irregular particles with nickel; iron-rich irregular\nparticles without nickel; iron-rich irregular particles; other irregular\nparticles. Nickel-iron, iron particles in which iron content greatly exceeds\nsilicon, and some siliceous particles were thought to be of cosmic origin.\nThey estimated that some %lo5 metric tons of black spherules are deposited\non the Earth annually andthat about 1 6 tons of all particles are accumulated.\n0\n\n1963 Wright and Hodge studied the composition of extraterrestrial particles\nand concluded from comparison of these objects with similar material of known\norigin that they are probably meteoroid ablation droplets.\nWright and Hodge also analyzed material from the stratosphere, polar\nice caps, and from ancient sediments. Their surface analyses were made with\nan electron probe.\n\n1964 Bradford and Dycus reviewed the meteoroid environment in cislunar space\nand on the lunar surface. They defined a micrometeoroid as less than lom4\ngrams in mass.\nDyeus, Luebbe, and Bradford investigated the problem of meteoroid flux\nin cislunar space. Their attention was devoted primarily to the effect of the\nEarth\'s gravitational field on the meteoroid flux, assuming the meteoroids to\nbe influenced only by the Earth\'s central force field. They found the flux\nto be a minimum just above the sensible atmosphere, increasing gradually to a\nmaximum at less than 7 Earth radii, then decreasing slowly to the deep space\nvalue. The region of enhanced flux lies in the antapex direction of the\nEarth (following the Earth in its orbit).\nEllyett and Keay analyzed the meteor rate obtained at Christchurch,\nNew Zealand. They found that the relation of meteor rate to lunar cycle\nsuggested by Bowen (1963) was doubtful.\nFiocco and Colombo reported optical radar experiments using a ruby\nlaser. They discovered a scattering layer at an altitude between 1 0 and\n1\n1 0 km. They assumed that the radar echoes were produced by meteoroids under4\ngoing progressive fragmentation during their flight through the atmosphere.\nThe atmosphere apparently acts as a filter, with the size distribution of\nparticles varying as a function of altitude. They estimated a total influx\nof the order of 6 ~ 1 tons per day. The mass flux of extraterrestrial mate0~\nrial is critically dependent on the height of which it is evaluated.\nHodge and Wright compared the compositions of spherules of meteoritic\n0\n0\nand volcanic origin. In the 1 to 1 0 micron size range, only about 2X10-5\nof volcanic particles are spheroids. They found the typical surface composition of volcanic ash to be 40 percent Fe, 20 percent Si, 10 percent Al,\n3 percent Ti, and 1 percent K, distinctly different from particles from polar\nice caps and favor a meteoroidal origin for particles from polar ice caps.\nHodge, Wright, and Langway analyzed dust particles from polar ice\ndeposits, They analyzed particle surfaces with an electron probe and found\nseveral particles with nickel-iron ratios indicative of a meteoric origin,\n\n63\n\nothers to be of cosmic origin. They found the rate of deposit of opaque\nspherules on the Earth was found to be nearly the same at all geographical\nlocations samples.\n\n1964 Honda and Arnold discussed the effects of cosmic rays on meteorites,\nwhich offer the opportunity for an extended study of the fossil record of\ncosmic radiation.\nLebedinets discussed the density of meteoric matter in the vicinity of\nthe Earth\'s orbit as determined from radar meteor observations. He argued\nthat meteoroids vaporize in the narrow range of heights from 100-110 km.\nIonized meteor trails were thought to expand greatly so that observation\nwould be difficult. He estimated that from lo4 to 2X105 tons of meteoric\nmatter are deposited on the Earth each year.\nPkignolia compiled a second supplement to his earlier bibliography on\ninterplanetary matter and included a total of 662 references.\nParker described the perturbation of interplanetary dust grains by the\nsolar wind. He expected that photoelectric emission from dust grains would\n0\nlead to a positive charge of the order of 1 volts on each grain. Assuming\nthat the sign of the interplanetary magnetic field reverses every few days,\nhe showed that the orbital inclination of particles with radii equal to or\nsmaller than 1X10-4 em at the orbit of the Earth is greatly increased by\nLorentz forces exerted on the charged particles by magnetic fields carrried\nin the solar wind.\nRosinski and Pierrard examined the relation of condensation of meteor\nvapors and their connection with noctilucent clouds and rainfall anomalies.\nThe size of secondary particles formed by coagulation is dependent upon the\nmass of meteor vapors produced by a meteor shower. The variable component in\nBowen\'s hypothesis can be attributed to variations in vertical transport\nthrough the 50-40 km layer. They assumed the primary mechanism of transport\nto be settling of coagulating particles in the gravitational field of the\nEarth. Changes in the density of the atmosphere versus height increase residence time of settling particles in the vicinity of 80 km, so that enhanced\ncoagulation can take place. Relatively large particles are formed in this\nway, accounting for those present in noctilucent clouds. Absorption of water\nvapor on the surface of an hydrous particles induces adsorption of nitrogen\n(11) oxide, promoting formation of positively charged particles. These\ncharged particles are subject to a converging horizontal Lorentz force, causing the accumulation of secondary particles and the formation of noctilucent\nclouds.\nSchmidt and Astha.na collected particulate matter from snows of\nRoosevelt Island, Antarctica.\nSchmidt and Cohen studied reported accretion rates for metallic spherules of cosmic origin. The data suggested that accretion rates increase with\nincreasing geomagnetic latitude of the collecting site. An attempt to account\nfor the latitude variation in the framework of classical theory for the motion\n\n64\n\nof a charged particle in the Earth\'s magnetic field. However, preliminary\ncalculations suggested that only charged, microscopic particles on the order\nof the smallest found to date could impinge preferentially at high latitudes.\nAn integrated, mean accretion rate of metallic spherules was about 7x104\nor approximately 1 percent of the total particle influx\n0\nmetric tons yr-\',\nas indicated by satellite data.\n\n1964 Schmidt, Giovinetto, and Asthana studied particulate matter from Camp\nMichigan, Antarctica.\nSchmidt, Giovinetto, and Asthana studied the occurrence of particulate\nmatter in four centuries of snow deposits at the South Pole.\nSchmidt and Keil studied polished sections of spherules from Atlantic\nOcean sediments. The results indicated that these spherules were meteoritic\nin origin, formed by ablation of meteorites upon atmospheric entry. Subsequent terrestrial alteration significantly modified spherules surfaces so that\nanalyses limited to surfaces cannot be regarded as representative of their\ncomposition.\nSurdin studied the distribution of interplanetary dust as a function of\nThe lowest distribution obtained was\nm\n\nmass, from a theoretical point of view.\n\nwhere df is the number of dust particles between\nthe average mass.\n\nm and dm, and\n\nis\n\nThompson and Schaeffer investigated the chlorine 36 content of Pacific\nOcean red clays. Chlorine 36, a cosmic-ray-induced nuclide, offers the possibility of characterizing extraterrestrial dust and measuring its influx to the\nEarth. I the sediment accumulation rate is assumed to be 1 mm per 1 0 years\nf\n00\n0\nand the chlorine 36 content of extraterrestrial dust is 2 0 dpm-kg, the upper\nlimit of chlorine 36 observed in the sediment indicates that less than lo6\ntons of extraterrestrial are contributed to red clays annually, on a worldwide basis.\nVronskiy and Florenskiy reviewed the problem of cosmic dust and its\nrelation to the origin of the Earth. They surveyed and reported results from\nterrestrial, rocket, and airplane collections of cosmic dust and summarized\nsatellite measurements of particle flux.\nZaslavaskaya, Zotkin, and Kirova described the size distribution of\ncosmic balls collected from the region of the Tungusska meteorite fall.
