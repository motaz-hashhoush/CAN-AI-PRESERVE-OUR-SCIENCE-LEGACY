The characteristics of pulsed plasma and ion engines are described and used to estimate of the mass of the propellant and thrusters for attitude control and stationkeeping functions for MSAT. Preliminary estimates indicate that the electric propulsion systems could also replace the large momentum wheels necessary to counteract the solar pressure; however, the fine pointing wheels would be retained. Estimates also show that either electric propulsion system can save approximately 18% to 20% of the initial 4,000 kg mass. The issues that require further experimentation are mentioned.", "title": "Electric propulsion", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T19:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19820020465, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820020465, "id": "e2080cec74bb48808b92feb6a951bdda", "publicationName": "Land Mobile Satellite Serv.
