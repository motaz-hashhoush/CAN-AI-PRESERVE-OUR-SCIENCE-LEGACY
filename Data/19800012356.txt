b'ESA BATTERY DEVELOPMENT\n\nH. J. Young and D. Goudot\nESA\n\nI should also mention that Dr. Goudot and myself are based at the Nuclear Space Agency\xe2\x80\x99s\nTechnology Center at Noordwijk in the Netherlands. ESA\xe2\x80\x99s activities for battery R&D are confined to applied programs, that isto say, they must be directly related future ESA projects.\nto\n\nto\nThere is coordination with CNES, the French Space Center in order harmonize the R&D\ninvestment with the sole manufacturer in Europe, namely SAFT. Although having an evident\ndisadvantage, this monopoly, in practice, permits efficient rationalization of development and gives\nautomatic standardization and continuity in the products with consequent increase in relevant experience with them.\nThe ESA program for some years has been concentrated upon three main objectives.\n(Figure 3-50)\nFirst, we are interested in the development of a higher capacity familyof nickel-cadmium\ncells in the range of 25 to 6 0 ampere-hours.\nSecondly, we are trying t o improve the existing NiCad range, which extends up to about 26\nampere-hours, the emphasis beingon weight reduction and quality. That is t o say, we are trying to\nenhance the mechanical and electrical behavior and lifetime.\nThirdly, our main development is in silver hydrogen cells. In addition, we cooperate with\nCNES, the French agency, in nickel-hydrogen development.\nThe first figure also shows the evolution of these developments. Taking the first of these\nthree objectives, the high capacity cells are now being requested for some application satellites,\nmainly telecommunications, with power demands of up to 2 kilowatts during the eclipse.\nIn consequence, it is planned t o develop a cell of approximately 40 ampere-hours in the 1980\nt o 1981 timeframe. I t is intended t o use the same technology as existing SAFT,4- t o 26-ampere\nso\nhour range, following the current operating modes, limits, and on.\n40\nI t is expected to achieve an energy density of around watt hours per kilogram at 100percent DOD. It is probable that the new family will have a common footprint modifying the\nheight as the simplest meanst o achieve various capacities.\n\nThis approach, which has been satisfactorily adopted for the current standard range, allows\nfor extensionsof the size with a minimum of development cost and delay.\n\n243\n\nThe second of these main objectives, improvement of the existing design, includes, first,\nthe\nthe achievement of a better understanding of the thermal behavior. Following a study contract\ncell\nwith Elektronikcentralen of Denmark, it now possible for us to undertake realistic thermalpreis\ndictions at batterylevel. This will be referred to a little bit later in context the silver hydrogen\nof\ncell development.\nNext, the saving in weight of approximately 5 percent for the23-ampere-hour-size cell in the\ncurrent range has been made possible by reduction of the can wall thickness.\n(Figure 3-5 )\n1\nThis is from 0.6 t o 0.4 millimeters. It was found, however, that the thinner wall doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce changes in the mechanical behavior of the battery level requiring a different approach to the\ndesign of the battery structure.\nThis figure shows the current ECS battery, which is the European Communication Satellite\nbattery\xe2\x80\x99s design, using the recently qualified thin wall cell and showing the lightweight structure\nadopted. In fact, there were titanium rods and end plates. Next, a new mechanical design for the\ninternal connections of cell electrodes for improvementof the vibration capability has recently been\nqualified at 22 grms in parameter.\n(Figure 3-52)\nThe design will be incorporated in cells of the next ECS battery model, and it is expected t o\nbe adequate to meet the anticipated\nlevels of both the Ariane launcher and the shuttle.\nThe figure shows the new leaf spring\ndesign that has been adapted. More recently, 7-ampere\nhour cells for the Exosat project,\nusing this design successfully withstood a level of 28.5 Grms. We\nexpect this design t o have some reserve as well in this respect.\nIn fact, with this number, there is an additional nylon locking piece that goes between the\ntop of the cell and the electrostack to pushin the stack during vibration.\n(Figure 3-53)\nA summary of the qualification procedure appliedt o t h eECS cells with details of the vibration spectrum is given in the next vugraph. At the 22 Grms level, development SAFT models\nsuccessfully withstood about 30 minutes endurance in each axis.\nNext, a study of electrochemical impregnation of the nickel electrode was completed in 1976,\nand subsequently a pilot manufacturing unit was built under the sponsorship of CNES. This would\nhave sufficient capacity to meet the future European needs. This anticipates that the advantages of\nthis technique are confirmed by samples currently in cyclic testing.\n\n244\n\n(Figure 3-54)\nThis vugraph shows the progress date comparing the evolution of thickness of electroto\nchemically and chemically impregnated electrodes to date, and the advantages of the electrochemical technique have been well demonstrated. For instance, there are some unimpregnated electrodes shown in the graph. That is the middle curve.\n\nA study of the plastic bonded cathode, which, for the moment, completes our various improvements, is in progress with the intention of further weight reduction of NiCadcells. We hope\nto introduce this type of electrode in lightweight cells in the near future, and some results should\nbe available by the end of 1980.\nThe third and largest ofESA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives is the successful development of the silver hydrogen\ncell. This activity started in 1974 with the feasibility study by Batelle predicting the possibility of\nachieving 80 Watt-hours per kilogram and a lifetime of between 4 and 5 years.\n(Figure 3-55)\nSince that time, following systematic studiesof silver electrodes, electrolyte management,\nand separator materials, the first generation cell was realized. This silver hydrogen cell, developed\nand shown in the next figure, was reported by SAFT at last year\xe2\x80\x99s symposium at Brighton in 1978.\nThe figure shows it compared in size with the current NiCad and nickel-hydrogen cells of approximately a different capacity.\n(Figure 3-56)\nThe development of a second generation hydrogen electrodeis now being considered. This\nwas seen previously to be a limiting factor i n the performance of the present cell. Concurrently,\nfollowing the review of all components, a detailed mechanical design study is soon to begin on a\nspherically shaped cell, and a working prototype of this cell is shown in the next figure. It is a t 24\nampere-hours.\nThe present situation indicates already that better results than those predicted are achievable\nwith an energy density of 90 watt-hours per\nkilogram and a comparable volumetric efficiency t o\nNiCad cells.\n(Figure 3-57)\nThis figure provides comparative weight breakdown of nickel cadmium, nickel hydrogen, and\nthe two generations of silver hydrogen cells. Just in case any of you noticed, this figure here proved\nto be somewhat optimistic. This one is somewhat pessimistic.\n\nI think this relates to Inconel 718 contained in that Inconel 65. As you can see here, we are\ngetting 91 watt-hours per kilogram for the sphericalcell. If you look at the volumetric efficiency,\nwe are showing a very good capability versus the NiCad.\n\n245\n\nPrototype cells which have been in test for years have been submittedto 24-hour cycles\n2\na t 50-percent DOD at both 20 and 0\xc2\xb0C. After approximately 550 cycles a t 20"C, some problems\nare evident as shown in the figure.\n(Figure 3-58)\nThe cause was attributed to short circuits caused by dimensional changes of the positive\nelectrodes. The new design will avoid this feature, but up the point of failure, no other problems\nto\nwere observed.\nAt O"C, the test is still running, after 700 cycles without any sign of failure, as shown in the\nnext figure.\n(Figure 3-59)\nIn these figures we must relate the pressures to the overall capacity available. In low-orbit\nconditions (i.e., with 100-minute cycles), the test has been in progress at 20\xc2\xb0C and 25-percent DOD.\n(Figure 3-60)\nThis test is still nlnning after 10,000 cycles. An initial variation in performance, as you can\nsee in this figure, is so far unexplained. However, the cell continues to give very satisfactory performance. I should also explain that these graphs areaverage data. In fact, the spread in reality was\nnot too great.\n(Figure 3-6 1)\nStorage testing first performed on samples in 1977 gives very attractive results, indicating a\ncomparable self-discharge t o NiCad cells. This next figure shows a loss of 15 percent after 1 month\nat 20\xc2\xb0C and 8 degrees at zero.\n(Figure 3-62)\nIt should be noted that this attractive behavior of the silver hydrogen couple is derived using\ncomponents available some 3 years ago.\nIn 1978, a thermal study of nickel-hydrogen and silver hydrogen cells was carried out by\nElektronikcentralen. Following a component analysis, a thermal model constructed as shown\nwas\nin this next figure, and this rather complex model shows the calculated delta temperatures at\nspecified nodal points of the\ncell for a constant I-watt dissipation within the electrode stack.\nThe results gave good correlation with values measured in practice. The results have also\nshown, however, that the heat evolutionis rather greater than that of the equivalentNiCad cells,\nand modifications will necessarily be introduced in the second generationcell design to improve\nheat dissipation and assist in definition of future battery structures.\n\n246\n\nh\n\nIt is envisaged that an egg-box like structure would be a likely solutionto the encapsulation\nof the spherical shape.As I mentioned previously, a further contract is now planned to study this\ncell design.\nIn parallel, lookinga t possible effects of hydrogen embrittlement and long-term\nhigh-pressure\ncycling, we are conducting a contract at Ecole Centrale in Paris. The smaller volume of the spherical\ncell will necessitate a working pressure of 50 bars at the end of charge. The question of safety in\nboth design and operation of metal hydrogen batteries has to be considered, and the study of\nsafety aspects is the prime objective of this metallurgical study.\nIn preparation for the future, a system study contract for metal hydrogen cells be given\nwill\nto one of the leading European prime contractors within the next few months. This study\nwill\nanalyze the problems of integration into spacecraft, looking at the mechanical, thermal, and electrical interfaces.\nHowever, it should not be concluded that metal hydrogen will automatically replace NiCad\nin ESA applications. For example, the merits of nickel hydrogen at least appear to be questionable,\nt o us at least, and historically systems with silver electrodes have not demonstrated the best lifetimes. The choice will necessarily be a question of tradeoffs, case by case.\nIn the near future, i t is intended to concentrate our efforts in the ESA battery test center to\nthe evaluation of both nickel hydrogen and silver hydrogen t o define the cell characteristics and to\ndetermine operation modes and to assess life duration, with the eventual objective of qualifying\ncells.\n(Figure 3-63)\nof\nThis series of figures shows the test center at Noordwijk and details some nickel-hydrogen\ntests that we are doing for CNES.\n\n(Figure 3-64)\nIn the center we can test exactly 100 batteries if necessary, 100 different tests. We have 2000\ndifferent data channels.\n(Figure 3-65)\nThis test done at CNESis comparing the performance andlife cycling of the cells with the\nstandard 23-ampere-hour nickel-cadmium space cell.\n(Figure 3-66)\nThis is a closeup, a detail of the cells being tested showing pressure tranducers at the top.\n\n247\n\nI have very briefly described our program which is rather ambitious technically, but is\nlimited inevitably by budget problems-in fact, in order to achieve our project readiness, we spend\nsomething annually like $300,000.\nFinally, this last figure provides a table with details of batteries used with\nESA spacecraft.\n(Figure 3-67)\nIt is a record that appears to be comparatively good upto the present time, and we hope it\nwill remain so. I think I can give you a few minutes to look at that. But, of course, weused the first\nEuropean battery on ESRO IV, the SAFT cylindrical cell. I thinkI should point out itis in this\nHEOS 1 we have got an orbital life of over 7 years. This doesn\'t apply to the silver cadmium\nbattery.\nIn the Meteosat 1, we have been experiencing a capacity degradation of almost 50 percent,\nwhich we attribute to bad battery manufacturing.We have a solution t o restore this t o full capacity\nin the next few weeks.\n\nI think I will finish there. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of SAFT, who provided\na lot of the data.\nDISCUSSION\nRITTERMAN: You pointed out some electrochemically impregnated positive data, and you\nshowed, I think, that therewas hardly any swelling or no swelling of that electrode.\nlevel and the nature of the electrochemical impregnation?\nCould you comment on the loading\nWhat solution is it impregnated from, and how many grams per cc void of active materials did you\nhave impregnated?\nGOUDOT: We have no data on that question. Even SAFT has no data. But that can be provided.\nGROSS: You indicated on one of your charts thatfor the OTS spacecraft, you had a new\nbattery management technique. Could you discuss what it was and why it was necessary, and what\nit did?\nGOUDOT: It\'s a new technique we are applying in OTS. It was based on tests we performed\nin the laboratory. It was based on the fact that we have a minimum of overcharge in the battery,\neven to keep the state of charge lower than 1 . We observe, in fact, in low orbit with a test performed at 80-percent DOD at 20\xc2\xb0C, three times expansion of the lifetime you have normally with\nthe commercial technique.\nThe technique used in OTS was to let the battery choosing the recharge capacity by recharging with a low-recharge coefficient; 1.2 in the beginning, until the battery reached the lower\n\n248\n\nvoltage in the charge, percent voltage, and at this moment the K factor was increasing by 3 percent,\nand each time by 3 percent. For the time being, after 2 years mission the coefficient is 1.05\nawaiting the degrading of voltage conditions until there is volting with present forms. And this\ntechnique normally must double the lifetime, at least.\nGROSS: There was laboratory data to base that operation on?\n\nGOUDOT: Y e s . We have that available for low orbit as\nwell as geosynchronous orbit. Many\nyears.\n\nGROSS: Second point. It was indicated on the chart that the ISEE spacecraft had a battery\nfailure. Could you discuss what that was?\nGOUDOT: In this project, due to the change load during this period, it was not possible\nof\nto do the same technique as OTS, requesting very stable loading. There we come back\nto the\ncommon scenario technique having voltage limitation at the end of charge. As I remember, it is\na 16-step voltage for end of charge as well as limitation. It is more common for that scene.\nYOUNG: About a11 I can say is that the limiting f-actor is the current carrying capability\npaper, but i n the second we were operating a t 1 . O 2 K factor. T h a t is the ratio of charge-discharge.\nIt\'s currently a t 1.05 aI\'tcr4 eclipse periods.\n\nI think your second questior] was, if I understood, you were asking what the failure was on\nISEE? In fact, this was shorting\nin cells, so the battery is now disconnected i n the spacecraft.\non the linlitations of your hydrogen electrode design,\nDYER: Can you comment further\nthe original hydrogen electrode design\'? You mentioned you have a second generation hydrogen\nelectrode.\nYOUNG: About all I can say is t h a t the limiting factor is the current carrying capability\nof the hydrogen electrode. The next design will be a lighter weight construction, but it will also\nhave a much greater current carrying capacity. I can\'t remember offlland what the density is for\nthat electrode.\n\nGOUDOT: We are going t o develop a new hydrogen electrode, because we developed silver\nelectrode and its perfomlance is now so good, we are limited by the hydrogen electrode. Following\nthat we are forced to develop a new type of electrode because what used until now was corning\nwe\nfrom the fuel cells development more than 10 years ago.\nYOUNG: As an additional comment on that, we use a thick electrode the silver hydrogen\nin\ncell anyway, which means that we are using fewer hydrogen electrodes the silver hydrogen cell.\nin\nSo it has to be beefed up a little.\nVAN OMMERING: I would like to mention that the data shown on the nickel-electrode\nexpansion were actually developed with the Intelsat contract with SAFT. The loading levels that\n\n249\n\nwere involved there were about standard loading\nlevel for thechemically impregnated electrodes.\nAnd under-impregnated electrodes were about70 percent, which was standard level. The electrochemically impregnated electrodes have the same loadinglevel as was under-impregnated chemically\nmade electrodes.\n\nAs a matter of fact, a question, I wonder you would elaborate on your assessment nickelif\nof\nhydrogen technology. It is questionable at this point.\nYOUNG: Thank you for the first comment. The opinion we have about the nickel hydrogen\nis that when you take into account the of volumetric efficiency, I think that we can also make\nloss\nthe point, the problem with the nickel-cadmium system is related largely to poor battery management on the spacecraft.\nI think one should get above all the noise, discussing what we should and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. I\nthink one should get a well-managed battery.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the differences in performance are\ngoing to be that great. So overall we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the energy density and the watt-hour efficiencies\nwill show significant improvement on the nickel cadmium.\nRITTERMAN: Are you confident that the hydrogen electrode was the limiting electrode in\nsilver hydrogen? Could you and the other gentleman comment\non the other density where the\nlimitation occurred, or the rate\nof discharge where the limitation occurred on the hydrogen\nelectrode?\nYOUNG: I am personally not competent about that.\nGOUDOT: We have no memory, andwe have no data there. But we have a report, and we can\nprovide the data to you if you want.\nOTZINGER: Are you getting favorable results from your silver hydrogen work? Can you tell\nme what the separation system consists of?\nYOUNG: Apart from the conventional answer of various polymers, etc., I will ask the SAFT\nrepresentative t o answer that. What the separator constituents are with silver hydrogen.\nFOUGERE: The separator constituted from the membrane associated with, number one,\nnylon; several layers of cellophane type membrane; plus\nseveral layers of nylon.\n\n250\n\n"\nb P A C E T E R Y E L O PE UN O P E [\nBAT DEV\nM IER 7\nN\n\nI\n\nINORGANIC EPARATI\nS\nAG\n\n-- - - -\n\nv\n\n.
