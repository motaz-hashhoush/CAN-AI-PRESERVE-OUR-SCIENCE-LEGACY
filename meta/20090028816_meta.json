The results presented in the paper indicate: (a) the methodology used for estimating the delay at the national level can be extended to estimate delays caused by a center and delays experienced by a center, (b)delays caused by a center can be predicted using that center's Weather Impacted Traffic Index (WITI) whereas delays experienced by a center are best predicted using WITI of that center and that of a few prominent centers (c) there is differential impact of weather of different centers on center delays.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090028816, "name": "INFORMS 2008", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "fc782a2591924581a3e02cb7047fb676", "startDate": "2008-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090028816, "id": "5f65f2b2d9b647fa8ff281978d9e7357", "publicationDate": "2008-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
