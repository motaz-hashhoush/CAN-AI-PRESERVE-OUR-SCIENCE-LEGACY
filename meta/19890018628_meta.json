Optical fibers are used to provide reference and object beam illumination for a standard two-beam speckle interferometer, providing set-up flexibility and ease of alignment. Piezoelectric fiber-stretchers and a phase-measurement/servo system are used to provide highly accurate phase steps. Intensity data is captured with a charge-injection-device camera, and is converted into a phase map using a desktop computer. The closed-loop phase-stepping system provides 90 deg phase steps which are accurate to 0.02 deg, greatly improving this system relative to open-loop interferometers. The system is demonstrated on a speckle interferometer, measuring the rigid-body translation of a diffusely reflecting object with an accuracy + or - 10 deg, or roughly + or - 15 nanometers. This accuracy is achieved without the use of a pneumatically mounted optics table.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19890018628, "endDate": "1989-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "4abc7920b13d4a16b79a0d4c09997f29", "id": "da5fdf5522d9469c872ffd30704db19b"}], "name": "Symposium on Optical and Optoelectronic Applied Science and Engineering", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "4abc7920b13d4a16b79a0d4c09997f29", "startDate": "1989-08-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890018628, "id": "0c15665297184a418b467db3b47d272b", "publicationDate": "1989-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890018628.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890018628/downloads/19890018628.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890018628/downloads/19890018628.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890018628/downloads/19890018628.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
