We also have put considerable effort in getting our results to the public via public lectures and through press releases. Taking a very broad view of our program, we are investigating the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies from their birth, approximately one billion years after the beginning of the Universe, to the present. We have found and characterized a population of galaxies that are no more than 1.4 billion years old. These may well be the Universe s first generation of infant galaxies. Looking at the Universe 500,000 years later, we see what appears to be a cluster of galaxies just beginning to form (a proto-cluster) around a luminous radio galaxy. Moving forward in time and closer to the present, we are studying clusters of galaxies that are less than half the age of the Universe. Our observations and analysis lead us to the important conclusion that the elliptical galaxies in these clusters must have had their last significant star formation some three billion years earlier, which is about the time when the proto-cluster was forming. Coming still closer to home, we are observing nearby massive clusters of galaxies that are approximately 12 billion years old. The gravity from these large aggregates of dark and luminous matter is so strong it warps space-time itself, and makes the cluster act as a cosmic telescope that magnifies the distant galaxies behind the cluster. We used the magnified (or lensed) galaxies to map the distribution of the dominant matter within the clusters, which is the so-called dark matter (the matter is invisible, and its nature is unknown). We also are using these cosmic telescopes to study the distant lensed galaxies that would otherwise be too small and too faint to be seen even by Hubble and the ACS.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030111901, "id": "3b92cd4d45484cb0abee28d2e769ef96", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030111901.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030111901/downloads/20030111901.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030111901/downloads/20030111901.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030111901/downloads/20030111901.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
