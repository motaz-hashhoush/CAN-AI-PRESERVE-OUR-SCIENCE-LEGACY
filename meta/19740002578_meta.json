The experimental approach consists of pulsing a molecular beam, allowing the pulse to strike an adsorbing surface and detecting the molecular pulse after it has subsequently desorbed. The technique is also found to be useful for general studies of adsorption under nonequilibrium conditions including the study of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. The shape of the detected pulse is analyzed in detail for a first-order desorption process. For mean stay times, tau, less than the mean molecular transit times involved, the peak of the detected pulse is delayed by an amount approximately equal to tau. For tau much greater than these transit times, the detected pulse should decay as exp(-t/tau). However, for stay times of the order of the transit times, both the molecular speed distributions and the incident pulse duration time must be taken into account.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740002578, "id": "39211376f0c640459945cbe37d465deb", "publicationDate": "1973-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740002578.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740002578/downloads/19740002578.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740002578/downloads/19740002578.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740002578/downloads/19740002578.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
