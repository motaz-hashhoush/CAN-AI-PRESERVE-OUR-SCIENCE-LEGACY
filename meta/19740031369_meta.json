Two primary mission modes of RAM are discussed in terms of capability provided, and major advantages and constraints. The Sortie mission mode uses  the Shuttle orbiter as the space platform and RAM as the scientific equipment carrier to provide a flexible and economical means for conducting short-duration manned investigations. The man-tended observatory mode uses Shuttle for delivery, periodic on-orbit update and service, and retrieval of the observatory, with RAM providing the interface with the Shuttle for servicing and the space platform functions for  operation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19740031369, "endDate": "1972-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Symposium on Space Shuttle Payloads", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "bcac4eb7940248cfab1329a78693c020", "startDate": "1972-12-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740031369, "id": "5b900e88125d4d53a9735c641aeb5407", "publicationDate": "1973-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
