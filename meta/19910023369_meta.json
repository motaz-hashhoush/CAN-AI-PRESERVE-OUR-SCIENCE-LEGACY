A tropospheric retrieval was developed through combination of channel 2 data from various view angles across the MSU scan swath to achieve cancellation of the influence of the lower stratosphere, and much of the upper troposphere, on that channel. Radiosonde validation of the MSU channel 2 and tropospheric retrieval anomalies was performed with 10 years of data at all U.S. controlled stations.", "title": "Global temperature variations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910023369, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spencer, Roy W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL., United States"}}, "id": "da25a114511c4477b4ddd3156c031c93"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910023369, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Christy, John R."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville., United States"}}, "id": "fdb2491feaaa41218b3285435b16da86"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910023369, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910023369, "id": "2e922513c06e488797e5107bb7c032c9", "publicationName": "NASA(MSFC FY91 Global Scale Atmospheric Processes Research Program Review", "publicationDate": "1991-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910023369.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910023369/downloads/19910023369.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910023369/downloads/19910023369.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910023369/downloads/19910023369.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
