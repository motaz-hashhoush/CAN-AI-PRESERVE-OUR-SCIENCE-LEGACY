The dispersion analysis is based on the nominal trajectory for the OFT-1 reference flight profile. The analysis was performed to determine state vector and performance dispersions (or variations) which result from the indicated 3-sigma uncertainties. The dispersions are determined at major mission events and fixed times from liftoff (time slices). The dispersion results are used to evaluate the capability of the vehicle to perform the mission within a 3-sigma level of confidence and to determine flight performance reserves.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770013204, "id": "35230787e2fa444f908a5f5c9efce7a8", "publicationDate": "1977-02-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770013204.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770013204/downloads/19770013204.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770013204/downloads/19770013204.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770013204/downloads/19770013204.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
