It is shown that it is possible to recover launch systems weighing as much as one million pounds at reasonable impact velocities using a hybrid parachute-retrorocket recovery system. The new Kevlar materials, which have a much higher strength-to-weight ratio than nylon materials, make it possible to recover a one-million-pound booster for a reasonable weight penalty. The selected input parameters to the parachute weight equation result in an accurate estimation of the current Space Shuttle solid rocket booster parachute recovery system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19800048714, "endDate": "1980-05-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "2d66d106af6449e7a8f4c4e75966aa0b", "id": "2794ed900aab4853883ef2efaee61d9d"}], "name": "International Meeting and Technical Display on Global Technology 2000", "location": "Baltimore, MD", "id": "2d66d106af6449e7a8f4c4e75966aa0b", "startDate": "1980-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800048714, "id": "dbeac24b2a954798bf64fd3dfe5f664f", "publicationDate": "1980-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
