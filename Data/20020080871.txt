b'Vision Screening\n\nA\n\nA NASA DEVELOPED\nEYESIGHT SCREENING\nSYSTEM OFFERS\nINSTANT DETECTION\nOF DEFECTS\n\nt right is the VisiScreenB\n\nOSS-C (Ocular Screening\nSystem-Clinical),a device\ndesigned to detect eye\nproblems in children through\nanalysis of retinal reflexes.\nThe system, which incorporates\nNASA image processing\ntechnology, was originally\ndeveloped by Marshall Space\nFlight center as an applications\nengineering project; it is now\nproduced and marketed under\nan exclusive NASA license by\nVision Research Corporation,\nBirmingham, Alabama.\nThe photorefractive OSS-C\noffers two major advantages in\neye screening: it is very fast,\nliterally as fast as taking a\nphoto, and it requires no\nresponse from the subject, thus\ncan be used to screen children\nas young as six months. OSS-C\nis capable of detecting a wide\nrange of eye problems that\nshould be treated by an eye\ncare professional to correct or\nprevent progression of the\ndefect. Vision Research\'s\nmarketing is targeted toward\n1) pediatricians and organizations concerned with children\'s\neyesight and 2 ) corporationsponsored mass screening\nservices in schools and day\ncil re centers.\n\nThe OSS-C\'s photorefractor is basically\na 35 millimeter\ncamera with a telephoto lens and an\nelectronic flash; the\ncamera system a\nlocated in the black\nbox. At vight is the\nhead positioning\nstation six and a half\nfeet from the camera.\nThe flash sends light\ninto the youngster\'s\neyes and the light is\nreflected from the\nchild\'s retinas back\nto the camera lens.\nThe photorefractor\nanalyzes the retinal\nreflexes generated by\nthe subject\'s response\nto the flash and\nproduces an image of\nthe child\'s eyes in which the\ncians in 16 states were using the\npupils are variously colored; the system.
