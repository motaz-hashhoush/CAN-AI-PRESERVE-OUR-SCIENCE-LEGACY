b'I\n\nEnvironment and Resources Management\n\nI\n\n-\n\nI\n\nMonitoring Earth\'s Atmosphere--\n\narth\'s atmosphere is a distinctive blend of\nchemistry that sustains life here on the planet.\nWith the global population nearing 6 billion, it\nis believed that human activities are inducing atmospheric change. Because of this linkage, modifications in\nthe atmosphere may be early harbingers of global\nclimate change. To better monitor the atmosphere, from\nthe ground, in the air, and from space, various tools are\nbeing employed.\nOne such tool is a new Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL)\nSystem, originally developed by Goddard Space Flight\nCenter and now available commercially from Science &\nEngineering Services, Inc. (SESI) of Burtonsville,\nMaryland through a technology transfer license.\nLidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging, an\noptical analog to radar. Using a lidar, short, intense\npulses of laser light are directed to disperse through the\natmosphere. As this laser light propagates, it interacts\nwith aerosols-particles of liquid or solid dispersed as a\nsuspension in gas-and molecular constituents. The\nbackscattered energy is measured by the Lidar system for\ndetailed study.\nSESI\'s Micro Pulse Lidar System is built to characterize numerous details of the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere, such as atmospheric cloud and\naerosol concentration. The system is suitable for\nenvironmental monitoring studies that require full-time,\nunattended measurements of cloud and aerosol height\nstructure.\nA main feature of SESI\'s MPL System is beam\nexpansion, making it eye safe at all ranges, including the\nexit aperture of the instrument. Being eye safe eliminates\nrisk to civilians or aircraft, even in continuous operation.\nThe device has impressive sensitivity in signal detection\nover a great range. The MPL is capable of detecting all\nsignificant cloud and aerosol scattering from the ground\nthrough the troposphere, and into the stratosphere-a\ndistance of over 15 miles. Designed for long-term\nunattended operation, the SESI MPL System is well\nsuited for applications requiring routine monitoring of\nthe atmosphere.\nBackscattered radiation received by the MPL is\ntransformed into electrical signals which are subsequently converted into digitized data. Data are then\ncollected, stored, and analyzed by the system\'s rackmounted IBM-compatible personal computer. The MPL\nPC also coordinates all of the system operations.\nAnother feature of the SESI Lidq is the\ninstrument\'s modest dimensions, allowing it to be used\nwhere space is limited. The system can also be equipped\nwith a protective climate-controlled enclosure, permitting placement of the system in field operations where\n\nCommercial BenefitMpinoffs\n\n- -\n\n-\n\nadequate sheltering facilities do not exist. Upgrading of\nthe unit can be easily done for greater resolution,\nperformance, or to make the instrument more rugged\nfor use in an aircrafi.\nStudies of climate dynamics, meteorological\nresearch, and environmental monitoring are but a few\npossible applications using SESI\'s Micro Pulse Lidar.\nSESI has been performing Small Business Innovation Research work for Goddatd Space Flight Center\nand Wallops Flight Facility, as well as private industries.\nSESI is engaged in the development of unique tunable\nsolid state laser systems, various lidar systems for\natmospheric measurements, detection and ranging\nequipment, and medical instrumentation.\n\n-\n\ni\nI\n\n1\n1\nI\n\n,I\n\n1\n"\n\n.-\n\nScience and Engineering Services, Inc. \'sMicro M e Lidar System\nresultedfiom NASA research andpatents.
