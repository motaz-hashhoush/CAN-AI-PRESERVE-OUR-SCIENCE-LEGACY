Kappraff\nLewis Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThe propulsion requirements are analyzed for round t r i p s t o Jupiter using the follow\xc2\xad\nAV: (1) optimize the heliocentric transfer an\xc2\xad\ning four concepts t o reduce the mission\ngles, (2) use low periapsis elliptical parking orbits at Jupiter, (3) use atmosphere braking\nat Earth return, and (4)use hyperbolic rendezvous at Jupiter. Total t r i p t i m e s of 500 t o\n2200 days and stay t i m e s of 0 t o 200 days were considered. The present study a l s o con\xc2\xad\ns i d e r s several types of maneuvers f o r entering and leaving an elliptical parking orbit, a\nrange of elliptical parking orbit apoapses, trajectories lying out of the plane of the eclip\xc2\xad\ntic, and symmetrical (transit t i m e s and angles the same f o r the outbound and the inbound\nlegs) and unsymmetrical trips. The analysis assumes successive two-body trajectories,\nimpulsive thrusting, and circular coplanar planetary orbits. The criterion f o r comparing\nthe various trajectories is the required total propulsive velocity increment.\nWith a low circular parking orbit at Jupiter and propulsive braking at Earth return,\neven the double Hohmann stopover round t r i p (the t r i p with the global minimum\nAV)\nAV (29 miles/sec). The use of atmospheric braking at Earth\nyields a high value for\nreturn and of elliptical parking orbits at Jupiter can markedly reduce the\nAV required\nfor Jupiter stopover round t r i p s . For example, the minimum total AV required for the\n1000-day t r i p with a 100-day stay time can b e reduced from 34 t o 8 miles per second.\nThis is typical of the AV reduction possible f o r the other t r i p s investigated. The result\xc2\xad\ning AV\'s a r e comparable to those f o r M a r s stopover round trips.\nAtmospheric braking at Earth allows nonstop t r i p s of 1400 days and longer t o be\nflown for a total AV of approximately 4 miles per second. This is about half the AV\nrequired for the best stopover t r i p and is comparable t o the AV for M a r s flybys. This\ndifference in AV between the stopover and nonstop t r i p s can be used to advantage in the\nhyperbolic rendezvous mission.\n\nc\n\nINTRODUCTlON\nExtensive studies have been made of the possible one-way, nonstop, and stopover\n\nround-trip trajectories t o the near planets of M a r s and Venus (e. g . , refs. 1 t o 8). Re\xc2\xad\ncently one-way trajectories t o Jupiter have been presented in reference 9. Little atten\xc2\xad\ntion, however, has been given t o stopover round-trip trajectories t o Jupiter. Some of the\nreasons for this are related t o trajectories. Cursory studies suggest long t r i p t i m e s and\nhigh propulsive velocity increments f o r the Jupiter trip. F o r example, the double\nHohmann stopover round t r i p t o Jupiter has a trip time of 6 y e a r s compared with about\n3 y e a r s for a similar trip t o Mars. When a low circular parking orbit at Jupiter and allpropulsive maneuvers are used, the total propulsive velocity increment for the double\nHohmann (minimum\nAV) Jupiter round t r i p is 29 compared with 7 miles per second f o r\nMars, or four t i m e s the value f o r the M a r s trip.\nIrrespective of the apparent difficulties of the trip, there are several scientific rea\xc2\xad\nsons f o r being interested in the exploration of Jupiter. It is the nearest of the "giant\nf\nplanets" that have characteristics greatly different from the t e r r e s t r i a l planets o Mer\xc2\xad\ncury, Venus, and Mars. It has been suggested that Jupiter may have some of the charac\xc2\xad\nt e r i s t i c s of a star. Jupiter also has an extensive system of moons that a r e of interest.\nThere a r e several concepts for reducing the mission propulsion requirements from\nthe high values suggested earlier, even f o r t r i p s of shorter duration than the double\nHohmann trip. First, f o r a given t r i p duration and stay time, the leg travel angles can\nbe selected t o minimize the propulsion requirements. Second, the use of elliptic parking\norbits at the target planet, as described in reference 7, is a particularly powerful way t o\nreduce propulsion requirements for t r i p s t o the massive planets. Third, atmospheric\nbraking may be used at Earth return. Fourth, several techniques of rendezvous at Jupi\xc2\xad\nt e r can b e used t o reduce the propulsive AV for part of the mission loads.\nThis report will examine the previously mentioned concepts and several related ones\nin an attempt t o find trajectories and modes of operation with low propulsion requirements.\nThe present study considers the following: round-trip durations o 500 t o 2200 days\nf\n(which includes the double Hohmann trip); stay times of 0 t o 200 days; several types of\nJupiter parking orbits; a range of elliptical parking orbit apoapses; symmetrical and un\xc2\xad\nsymmetrical trips; the effect of atmospheric braking at Earth; rendezvous at Jupiter; and\ntrajectories t o avoid the asteroid belt.\n\nMITHOD OF ANALYSIS\n\nGeneral Approach\nA typical stopover round t r i p t o Jupiter is shown in figure 1. The t r i p starts from a\n1. 1 Earth radii circular orbit. A propulsive velocity increment AV1 is impulsively ap\xc2\xad\nplied in Earth orbit t o send the space vehicle toward Jupiter. The heliocentric angle tra\xc2\xad\n2\n\nversed and the outbound travel time from Earth\nt o Jupiter are q0 and To, respectively. (The\nsymbols are defined in the appendix.) The out\xc2\xad\nbound travel time and angle are defined from\nEarth orbit t o the periapsis of the trajectory ar\xc2\xad\nriving at Jupiter. A second velocity increment\nAV2 is imparted to the vehicle in the vicinity\nof the trajectory periapsis at Jupiter to establish\na parking orbit about the planet. During the\nstay t i m e Ts in the parking orbit, both Jupiter\nand the vehicle t r a v e r s e the heliocentric angle\nqS. At the end of the stay, a third propulsive\nvelocity increment AV3 starts the spacecraft\non a trajectory back t o Earth. The return tra\xc2\xad\njectory covers the heliocentric angle Gb and\nFigure 1. - Typical stopover round-trip trajectory to Jupiter.\nA\ntime T ~ . t Earth return either propu~sive\nbraking t o a low circular orbit, AV4, o r atmo\xc2\xad\nspheric braking, AV4 = 0, is used. (Combinations of atmospheric braking and propulsive\nbraking a r e not considered. )\nThe objective of t h i s analysis is t o find those trajectories that yield a minimum total\npropulsive velocity increment\nAV (where\nAV = AV1 + AV2 + AV3 + AV4) f o r a given\ntotal t r i p time TT and stay time at the destination planet Ts. Several basic relations\ncan be written directly from the description of the mission and figure 1. The total t r i p\ntime is the sum of the t i m e s along the various segments:\nJupiter sphere\nof i n f l u e n c e 7\n\nTT = T o + T s + T b\n\nAlso, the heliocentric t r a v e l angle of the vehicle QT is the sum of the travel angles\nalong the various segments:\n\nT o achieve a return t o Earth, the heliocentric t r a v e l angle of the Earth in its orbit about\nthe Sun must be the s a m e as the travel angle o the vehicle about the Sun plus an integral\nf\nnumber of revolutions:\n\nIf the travel time To and the travel angle from E a r t h to Jupiter periapsis\n\nq0 (or what\n3\n\nis equivalent, the launch date and travel time) of a trajectory are specified, the transfer\norbit elements may be calculated, and hence the terminal heliocentric velocities and path\nangles may be calculated, by the method of reference 1. In this reference the planetary\nmotions as given by an ephemeris are approximated by mutually inclined ellipses, and the\nplanetary velocity vectors and positions are calculated from these. The interplanetary\ntrajectory of the vehicle is assumed t o b e composed of planet- and Sun-centered conic\nsegments matched at the sphere of influence. A typical trajectory calculation is made as\nfollows:\n(1)A launch date is specified. This defines the position and motion of the Earth when\nthe space vehicle departs from Earth.\n(2) An Earth t o Jupiter transfer time To is selected. This, together with the launch\ndate, defines the position and motion of Jupiter at the a r r i v a l of the space vehicle. To\xc2\xad\ngether steps 1 and 2 define To and q0.\n(3) The unique transfer trajectory, three conic sections "patched\' \' together, that\nconnects Earth and Jupiter in the specified outbound leg time is found by an iteration pro\xc2\xad\ncess.\nA return leg trajectory may be calculated similarly, where the Jupiter departure date\nis determined by the a r r i v a l date plus the stay time; also, the return leg time is deter\xc2\xad\nmined by the total t r i p time and the outbound leg plus stay time.\n\nI nter planeta r y Trajectories\nJupiter trajectories are considered here at two levels of precision. The more pre\xc2\xad\nc i s e technique assumes Jupiter and\nEarth are in inclined elliptic orbits, as\nTABLE I. - PLANETARY CONSTANTS\nin reference 1 and as mentioned previ\xc2\xad\nously.

For coplanar circular planetary orbits and sym\xc2\xad\nmetrical trips, the equations for the total t r i p time and total travel angle may be written\nas functions of the two independent variables To and $bo. Thus, equation (1) becomes\n\nTT = 2T0 + Ts\n\n(6)\n\nand from equations (3) t o (6),\n\nTs =\n\n- *a\n\n(2q0 - 2T00, + 360\xc2\xb0N,)\n\n(7)\n\nWhen the numerical values f o r the orbital characteristics of Earth and Jupiter listed in\ntable I a r e used, equation (7)may be written as\nTs = 2 . 2 1 $bo - 2 . 1 8 To\n\n+ 398.0 N\n,\n\nFurther consequences of assuming a symmetrical trip are that AV1 = AV4,\n4\nAV round t r i p now con\xc2\xad\nAV2 = AV3, and AV1 + AV2 = AV3 + AV4. Also, a minimum\n1\nsists of two legs, each of which corresponds t o a minimum AV1 + AV2 leg.\nMinimum AV1 + AV2 legs. - To find those interplanetary legs that yield a minimum\n.\n\nAV1 + AV2, a reference parking orbit at Jupiter is selected. The reference parking orbit\nis a circular one at 1 . 1 Jupiter radii. For the reference parking orbit, the AV may b e\ncalculated as described in the later section on parking orbits.\nMinimum AV1 +. AV2 legs for specified outbound leg t i m e s To are found by search\xc2\xad\ning over a range of E a r t h departure dates (or what is equivalent, a range of travel angles\nq0). Typical results f o r To = 215, 544, and 1088 days are shown in figure 2(a), (b), and\n( e ) , respectively.

Because of the\nmonotonically decreasing slope of this curve\n(the curve for the return leg is the same),\nit can be deduced that for a given total t r i p\nduration and all propulsive maneuvers (i.e.,\nno atmospheric braking) the symmetrical\ntrajectories give the lowest C AV. This\npoint is illustrated later.\nTotal t r i p time and stay time. - The\ntransfer angles q0 corresponding t o the\nminimum AV1 + AV2 legs a l s o result from\nthe method of reference 1 and a r e plotted in\nfigure 4 as a function of the mission dura\xc2\xad\ntion.

The\nmethod of reference 1 describes how the values of To and Go are obtained for one leg\nof a round trip. This section describes how the information f o r two single legs is com\xc2\xad\nbined to yield a round trip, and a l s o prepares the way for the following section dealing\nwith parking orbits by describing the trajectories inside the Jupiter sphere of influence\nin detail. The matching of the inbound and outbound legs occurs in the vicinity of Jupiter\nand is part of the parking orbit arrival o r departure maneuver.\nPlanetocentric coordinates. - It is convenient to describe the trajectory in the vicinity\nof Jupiter, that is, within the Jupiter sphere of influence, in coordinates centered on the\nplanet. An appropriate coordinate system is shown in figure 7(a); the x-axis is the\nJupiter-Sun line, with the positive x-axis directed away from the Sun, and the y-axis\nforms a right-hand system when viewed from the north ecliptic pole. The x-direction is\nset at the time of arrival of the vehicle at the Jupiter sphere of influence and is thereafter\nfixed in inertial space; that is, while the center of the coordinate system moves with\nJupiter, the x-axis continues to point at a fixed point on the celestial sphere.\nf\nThe change from heliocentric t o planetocentric coordinates is made at the sphere o\n7 miles about Jupiter, shown schematically in\ninfluence - a sphere of radius rmE 3x10\nfigure 7(a), and to scale in figure 1 (p. 3). The change is made by taking the vector dif\xc2\xad\nference between the vehicle heliocentric velocity vector VH and the planet velocity vector\nV q , both at the time of arrival at the sphere of influence. This gives the planetocentric\n,\n,\nhyperbolic excess velocity vector defined by V, and a, where a is measured with\nrespect t o the local heliocentric horizontal at the time of arrival at the sphere of influ\xc2\xad\nence.

The further assump\xc2\xad\n\ntions made for the parking orbit analyses are as follows:\n(1) The planet is spherically symmetric (nonoblate).\n(2) The maneuvers are made impulsively.\n(3) The minimum periapsis consistent with avoiding atmosphere effects is somewhat\narbitrarily taken as 1.1times the planet surface radius.\nWhen the parking orbit is in the plane of the interplanetary trajectories, part o r all\nof the required turning 9 can result from the turning due t o the gravity a\xef\xbf\xbdthe planet 6:\n\nwhere\nis given by equation (19) (see also fig. 7(c), p. 10).\nThe greatest turning due t o gravity occurs for the minimum periapsis r = 1.1.\nP\nValues of 6 f o r r = 1.1 are also plotted in figure 10. The 6 decreases from near\nP\n155\' at the Hohmann leg time of 940 days to near 90\' for a leg time of 300 days. The 9\nand 6 curves c r o s s at leg time in the neighborhood of 530 days. The difference between\nthis turning and the required turning 8 is u:\n0=9-6\n\n(23)\n\nA positive value u u (To less than about 500 days) indicates that the turning due t o\nf\ngravity is insufficient. Similarly, a negative a (To greater than about 570 days) indi\xc2\xad\ncates that there is an excess of gravity turning. The propulsive AV\'s and the type of\nparking orbit to be used depend on the sign of u. The direction of rotation about Jupiter\nwas chosen in every case to minimize C A V .\nReference low circular orbit. - The reference parking orbit referred to previously\nis a circular orbit at 1. 1 Jupiter radii (fig. ll(a)). This parking orbit is in the plane de\xc2\xad\nfined by Jupiter and the direction of V\nand V,, 3. When the orbits of Jupiter and\nO0, 2\nEarth are assumed coplanar, the parking orbit is in the plane d the planets. The AV to\narrive at or leave this parking orbit is\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nv,\n\nI\n\n\n= (\'\n$\n2\n\n-Sphere of\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n/\n\n-------/\n\n/\n\ninfluence/\n\n\\--\n\n1-\n\n(b I Ci r c ularize-decircularize parking orbit.\n\n\' CD-8512\n\n(c) Elliptic parking orbit with off-periapsis thrusting.\n\nFigure 11. -Jupiter parking orbits.\n\nThe period o the orbit is\nf\n\nAn advantage of the low circular orbit is that its period T is generally small com\xc2\xad\npared with the stay time Ts. Thus, the time used to achieve the appropriate orientation\nfor the departure hyperbola is negligible compared with the stay times or leg times, and\nthere is no specific AV penalty t o achieve the required reorientation.\nThe disadvantage of the low circular orbit is that the AV% to a r r i v e and depart from\n\n16 \n\n\nit are higher than for the following orbits.\nCircularize-decircularize maneuver.\n\n- The circularize-decircularize maneuver\n\nshown in figure l l ( b ) occurs in the same plane as that of the circular orbit described pre\xc2\xad\nviously. The spacecraft transfers from the hyperbolic approach trajectory t o an ellipti\xc2\xad\ncal trajectory at point 2. The approach hyperbola and parking ellipse are cotangential at\ntheir common apse which is at 1.1 Jupiter radii. The propulsive impulse is tangential\nand retrograde. At the apoapsis of the ellipse, point 2a, tangential and posigrade thrust\nsends the spacecraft into a circular orbit whose radius is the apoapsis radius of the\nellipse. The turning angle a is traversed in this high circular orbit t o achieve the de\xc2\xad\ns i r e d orientation f o r the departure. At point 3a, a tangential retrograde impulse places\nthe space orbit in a second ellipse with the same values for the apses as the first ellipse.\nA tangential posigrade thrust at point 3 inserts the spacecraft into the Earth return trajec\xc2\xad\ntory. This parking orbit requires four impulses. The\nAV is reduced from that\nneeded f o r the circular reference orbit by an amount AVs:\n\nThe period of the parking orbit is\n\nwhere Nc and Ne are the number of completed circular and elliptic orbits, respec\xc2\xad\ntively. F o r the type of orbit depicted in figure ll(b), Ne = 1 and Nc = 0.\nE lliptic orbit with off-periapsis thrusting. - This elliptic orbit, which is shown in\nfigure ll(c), is a l s o in the plane of the planetary orbits. The parking ellipse has a peri\xc2\xad\napsis of l. l Jupiter radii and its axis at midstay time o r midtrip duration is the JupiterSun line f o r a symmetrical round trip. The required relative orientations of the a r r i v a l\nand departure hyperbolas a r e obtained by arriving, point 2, and departing, point 3, from\nthe parking ellipse at t r u e anomaly angles different from zero. The t r u e anomaly is\nchosen t o minimize the propulsive AV. The parking orbit requires two nontangential\nthrusting impulses and can be used for either positive o r negative values of a. A system\xc2\xad\natic search over a range of t r u e anomalies was made t o find the ones yielding the mini\xc2\xad\nmum\nAV while satisfying the boundary conditions.\nApo-twist. - The apo-twist parking orbit is shown in figure ll(d). In general, it lies\nin planes inclined t o the plane of the planets. The first impulse, point B, to acquire the\nelliptical parking orbit is a cotangential retrograde thrusting at 1.1 Jupiter radii, which\n~~\n\n~\n\n17 \n\n\n1%\n\n-I\n-.\n,\n\nI\n,I .\n\n... .... ..\nm. .\nI .\n\n,\n\n(d) Apo-twist parking orbit.\nFigure 1 .\n1\n\n- Concluded.\n\nis the common apse of the approach hyperbola and the initial semiellipse. At the apo\xc2\xad\napsis of the ellipse, point C, a second out-of-plane impulse is applied t o twist the ellipse\nabout its major axis without changing its orbit elements. The departure maneuver,\npoint B, is similar t o that of arrival. The spacial orientation o the ellipses and twist\nf\nangle were chosen t o satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the a r r i v a l and departure\nhyperbolas. This parking orbit has three maneuvers and is applicable only when u is\npositive.\nAV is reduced from that needed f o r the circular reference orbit by an\nThe\namount AVs:\nAVs = 2(Ve,\n\nwhere X is the twist angle.\n\n18\n\n- Vcl.\n\n1) - 2Ve, a Sin x\n2\n\nThe period of the ellipse is\n\nNonstop Round Trips\nFor some nonstop round trips, the gravity of Jupiter provides the c o r r e c t planeto\xc2\xad\ncentric turning 8 ; that is, u has a value of zero. These nonstop t r i p s can b e accom\xc2\xad\n\nB2\n\nplished without any propulsive effort\nrequired at Jupiter. For t r i p s that\nyield a negative u (fig. 10, p. 14), the\ngravity turning can be reduced by sim\xc2\xad\nply increasing the radius of periapsis\npassage. In this manner, (T can b e\nmade z e r o and no AV will b e required\nas before. When gravity does not pro\xc2\xad\nvide enough turning (a positive), how\xc2\xad\never, propulsion is required t o generate part o the turning as illustrated in\nf\nfigure 12.

However, f o r missions t o Jupiter it may be advanta\xc2\xad\ngeous to travel out of the ecliptic plane t o minimize hazards posed by passing through the\ncenter of the asteroid belt. The greatest density of asteroids lies in the ecliptic plane at\na distance of about 2 . 8 astronomical units from the Sun. An out-of-ecliptic mission can\nbe accomplished by employing either a single- o r broken-plane E a r t h to Jupiter transfer\nas shown in figures 13(a) and (b), respectively.\nFor an out-of-ecliptic mission, the Earth departure is made s o that some desired al\xc2\xad\nf\ntitude from the ecliptic H is achieved at the radius R from the Sun. I the broken plane\ntransfer is being used, a AV is applied at the point of maximum H t o put the vehicle on\nan intercept trajectory with the target planet.

For the stopover trajecto\xc2\xad\n\nries, stay t i m e s of 50, 100, and 200\ndays are presented. The stay time f o r\nthe nonstop trips is, of course, zero.\nA s a whole, the curves f o r each of\nthe parking orbits show a modest increase in Z A V with decreasing t r i p\nduration f r o m 2200 to 1000 days. A\nfurther decrease t o 600 days results in\na marked increase in C A V . For this\nreason the 1000-day trip is an interest\xc2\xad\ning one, and it is used in l a t e r discussions t o illustrate the effect of several\ntrajectory variations. \n\nThe following sections discuss in\n\ndetail the effects shown in figure 14.\n\nEffect of Atmosphere Braking\nThe upper two sets of curves in figure 14 show the effect of atmospheric braking on\nthe total mission AV if a low circular parking orbit is used at Jupiter. The uppermost\ns e t u s e s propulsive braking at Earth return, the lower set u s e s full atmospheric braking\nat Earth return. The effect of using atmospheric braking is to reduce the total mission AV\nby 4 miles p e r second f o r the longer t r i p s and 10 miles p e r second f o r the 600-day trip.\nThe corresponding Earth approach velocities a r e shown in figure 15. These are the\natmospheric entry velocities if no supplemental propulsive deceleration is used. For\nt r i p durations of 1000 days and longer, the entry velocities are less than about 10.5 miles\nper second o r they a r e about twice the circular orbital velocity at 1. 1 Earth radii.

It was argued in the METHOD O F ANALYSIS section that for\n4 \n\nall-propulsive t r i p s symmetrical trajectories should give the lowest\nAVn. This\nn=1\npoint is illustrated by the upper curve. The outbound leg time for the symmetrical t r i p\n4\nis 450 days.\nWhen atmospheric braking is used and if there is no restriction on the Earth ap\xc2\xad\n3\nAVn is desirable. In this case, symmetrical\nproach velocity, then a minimum\nn= 1\n3\nt r i p s no longer yield the minimum\nAVn as illustrated by the lower curve. A\nAV\nn= 1\nof 0 . 2 mile per second l e s s than that for a symmetrical t r i p is possible by increasing the\noutbound leg time from 450 t o 500 days. The increase in Earth approach velocity is about\n0 . 4 mile per second.\nThe following results use atmospheric braking at Earth return and a r e symmetrical\ntrips. A slight reduction, like 0 . 2 mile per second, from the\nAV\'s shown is thus\npossible.\n\n23 \n\n\nEffect of Parking Orbit Type and Stay Time\nThis section presents in detail the AV requirements of each parking orbit discussed\nin the METHOD OF ANALYSIS section. The period of each elliptic parking orbit is as\xc2\xad\nsumed to equal the stay time.\nLow circular parking orbit. - This parking orbit was used t o show the advantage of\natmospheric over propulsive braking at Earth return. As mentioned before, the second\nset of curves on figure 14 shows the total mission AV for the low circular parking orbit\nwith atmospheric braking. The individual AV\'s f o r this trip may be determined from\nthe data of figure 3 (p. 7). The AV1 and AV4 (AV, = AV4 f o r symmetrical trips) thus\ndetermined are common t o all mission profiles with the same t r i p duration and stay time.\nFor the low circular parking orbit, the effect of stay time on mission AV is quite\nsmall for t r i p s of 1000 days o r longer (fig. 14). However, for shorter t r i p s an appreci\xc2\xad\nable AV penalty is incurred in increasing the stay time from 50 t o 200 days.\nCircularize-decircularize parking orbit. - It can a l s o b e seen in figure 14 that using\na circularize-decircularize parking orbit (depicted in fig. ll(b), p. 16) reduces the C AV\nt o about half that for a low circular park\xc2\xad\ning orbit. The individual AV\'s for the\nmaneuvers at Jupiter f o r this parking orbit\nare given in figure 17. It must b e remem\xc2\xad\nJupiter stay time,\nbered that the period of the parking orbit\ndays\nis equal t o the stay time; that is, there\n0\n50\n0\n1\n0\nare no integral revolutions in the high c i r \xc2\xad\nA\n!M\ncle o r in the ellipse.

For the 1000-day trip, this parking orbit requires from 2 . 6 to 3 . 6 miles per\nsecond l e s s propulsive effort than the previous case. At t r i p times shorter than 1000 days,\nthe AV requirement increases rapidly and the advantage of this maneuver is lost. The\nindividual AV\'s for this parking orbit are shown i n figure 18. Compared with the\nand AV3, a a r e eliminated\ncircularize-decircularize orbit, the high values of AV\n2, a\naltogether and the values of AV2 and AV3 have increased modestly over the values of\nand AV\ngiving a net reduction in X A V .\nP\n3, P\'\nThe effect of the parking ellipse orientation on propulsion requirements is shown in\nfigure 19.

For the 1000-day t r i p with a 100-day stay (fig. 14,\n.p. 22), the apo-twist maneuver yields a C A V of about\n7 5 2\n>\n8 . 5 miles per second, or 0.7 miles per second l e s s than the\n>\n.m\nellipse with off-periapsis thrusting.

The twist velocity increment\nAVt, which is the penalty f o r achieving the required orientation of the ellipse, is about\n0 . 5 mile per second, a low value. The values of AV2 and AV3 a r e f o r arriving or de\xc2\xad\nparting from the ellipse periapsis with tangential thrusting.\nEffect of stay time on mission AV. - The elliptic parking orbits discussed all show\nthe same general characteristics with increasing stay time. At the longer trip times,\n=- 1400 days, longer stay t i m e s tend t o yield the lower C AV. The longer period el\xc2\xad\nTT lipses have higher energies and consequently require lower AV\'s for the arrivaldeparture maneuvers. The opposite trend occurs f o r the shorter t r i p durations in that\nlonger stay times increase the C A V . Longer stay times mean decreased leg times. The\nincrease in AV associated with shorter leg t i m e s (fig. 3, p. 7) outweighs the previously\nmentioned trend of decreasing AV with longer elliptic periods that predominates at the\nlonger t r i p times.\nEffect of parking orbit period on mission\nAV. - All the preceding elliptic parking\nf\norbit data a r e for the case where the period o the parking orbit is equal to the stay time.\nThe effect of an elliptic parking orbit with periods l e s s than the stay time is shown in fig\xc2\xad\nu r e s 21 and 22.

(As a point of\ninterest, the Jupiter sphere of influence is at about 600 radii. ) The ellipse periapsis de\xc2\xad\ncreases rapidly with decreasing period, f o r instance, to 38 radii at a period of 10 days.\nThe radii of some of the moons of Jupiter a r e also noted on the curve for comparison.\nThe ellipse with a 7-day period has an apoapsis at about the s a m e radius as Callisto and\nhence may be of interest. The other moons a r e at still lower radii.\nFigure 22 shows the mission C A V as a function of elliptic period for the 1000-day\nt r i p using circularize-decircularize, ellipse with off-periapsis thrusting and the apo-twist\nparking orbits. Integral number of revolutions in the elliptic orbit are noted on each\ncurve. The circularize-decircularize curve is shifted t o the left due to the time required\nto accomplish the turning angle (T in the high circular orbit.\nFor the 1000-day trip, the apo-twist parking orbit gives the lowest C A V over a\nbroad range of ellipse periods. However, the fire-off-periapsis maneuver is least af\xc2\xad\nfected by a reduction in the elliptic period. For instance, the percentage increases in\nmission Z A V required to go t o a 10-day from a 100-day ellipse at Jupiter (but with a\n27 \n\n\n100-day stay in all cases) is 6.7, 21, and 32 percent for the fire-off periapsis, apo-twist\nand circularize-decircularize parking orbits, respectively. At ellipse periods less than\nabout 16 days, corresponding to low apoapsis radius, the ellipse with off-periapsis\nthrusting yields a lower AV than the apo-twist maneuver.\nNonstop round trips. - For trips of 1000 days and longer, the nonstop trips give lower\nC AV\'s than the stopover t r i p s (fig. 14, p. 22). For t r i p s of 1400 days and longer, the\nAV is about 4 miles per second, about half that f o r the best stopover trips. For these\ntrips the gravity of Jupiter alone provides adequate turning. The only propulsion f o r the\ntrip is that t o depart Earth AVl. The desired turning at Jupiter is achieved by the selec\xc2\xad\ntion of the periapsis of the encounter hyperbola. The periapsis radii are given in fig\xc2\xad\nu r e 23. For the 1400-day trip the value is 9. 9 Jupiter radii.\nFor the 1000-day trip, propulsive turning in addition t o the turning due t o gravity of\nJupiter is required (as depicted in fig. 12, p. 19). The periapsis is 1. 1 radii and the\nC A V is now 6.0 miles per second, about 2.5 miles per second less than f o r the best\n100-day-stay stopover t r i p (fig. 14). The magnitudes of the propulsive maneuvers re\xc2\xad\nquired near Jupiter depend on the periapsis of Jupiter passage, and the eccentricities\n\nSingle impulse\nOptimum double impulse\n\nI\n\n\n1\n4\n\n400\n\n1200\n1600\n2000\nTrip duration, TT, days\n\n800\n\n510\nv\n\n2400\n\nFigure 23. - Variation of propulsive velocity\nincrement required at Jupiter and radius\nof periapsis passage with mission duration\nfor nonstop round trips.\n\n28 \n\n\nTurning,\n\nu, deg\n\nFigure 24. - Variation of velocity increment required at Jupiter\nwith turning and hyperbolic excess velocity for optimum doubleand single-impulse sphere-of-influence turning maneuvers.\n\nand inclinations of the planetary orbits which are here assumed zero.

The AV penalty associated with flying this mission is plotted in figure 25(a)\nagainst distance out of the ecliptic. For this example, R = 2. 8 astronomical units and a\nlow circular parking orbit is used at Jupiter. This figure shows that the AV penalty is\napproximately linear with H and reaches a value of 6 . 7 miles per second at an altitude\nof 0.5 astronomical unit from the ecliptic.

This represents an increase in mission\nAV of 84 percent if the apo-twist parking orbit is used at Jupiter and an increase of\n24 percent if the low circular parking orbit is used. It is apparent that f o r this mission\nan appreciable AV penalty can b e involved with flying out of the ecliptic.\nA trajectory that passes the same distance H above the ecliptic plane at R = 2 . 8\nastronomical units is possible with no AV at 2 . 8 astronomical units if a 180\' transfer\nleg is used. This is a single-plane transfer. The trajectory with a minimum AV1+AV2\nf o r a 180\' transfer is the Hohmann semiellipse. The round t r i p made up of an outbound\nand inbound leg of Hohmann t r a n s f e r s has a total t r i p duration o 2200 days and a stay\nf\ntime of about 315 days. The AV penalty for traveling out of the ecliptic for this t r i p is\nshown in figure 25(b). It is much smaller than f o r the 1000-day trip, about 1 . 2 miles per\nsecond at H = 0 . 5 astronomical unit. For leg t i m e s l e s s than the Hohmann leg time the\nAV penalty f o r the single-plane out-of-ecliptic trajectory will increase and is expected\nt o be comparable t o that f o r the broken-plane transfer f o r the 1000-day trip.\n\nRendezvous at Jupiter\nThe possible use of rendezvous at Jupiter is illustrated in figure 26.

This craft is sent on a lowenergy longer-leg-time trajectory than that for the crew ship. T o have the equipment at\nJupiter when the crew a r r i v e s , this craft must depart about 1 3 months before the crew.\nThe second craft is the crew ship; it travels the stopover round trip. For this ex\xc2\xad\nample a 1000-day t r i p with a 100-day stay, and an elliptical parking orbit with off\xc2\xad\nperiapsis thrusting is used. This parking orbit was chosen because the Jupiter rendez\xc2\xad\nvous is more advantageous with this parking orbit. Also this parking orbit may be a\nfavorable one for the exploration of the Jupiter moons.\nThe third craft c a r r i e s the Earth deceleration system and the return leg life-support\nweight. It flies a nonstop round-trip trajectory with a return leg coincident with the re\xc2\xad\nturn leg of the stopover trajectory. The departure from Earth may occur a month after\nthe crew ship.\n1\nThe propulsion requirements described for the three crafts a r e shown in table 1 .\nThe\nAV f o r the Jupiter exploration equipment, AV1 + AV2, has been reduced from a\nvalue of 9.2 (if this equipment is carried with the crew) to 5. 5 miles per second. The\nAV of the Earth return equipment has been reduced from 9 . 2 to 6 . 0 miles per second.\nAV\nDepending on the mass carried in each phase of the mission, the reductions in\nf o r two phases of the mission can result in a significant saving in initial mass in Earth\norbit. This has been but an example of what can be done with multiple-phase rendezvous\n\nc\n\nc\n\nTABLE II.\n\n-\n\nPROPULSION REQUIREMENTS FOR JUPITER RENDEZVOUS\nTRIP CREW TRAJECTORY\n\n[Trip duration, 1000 days; stay time, 100 days; elliptical parking orbit with\noff-periapsis thrusting. ]\nI\nJupiter exploration\nequipment ship\n\n1\n1\nCrew ship\n\nIII\nEarth return\nequipment ship\n\nOne way trajectory,\n-790 day out-bound\nleg (100-dayorbit),\nmiles/sec\n\nPropulsion required\n\nStopover\ntrajectory\n(round-trip\nLOO-day orbit),\nmiles/sec\n\nNonstop tra\xc2\xad\njectory (roundtrip zero stay),\nmiles/sec\n\nhV1\n\n5.2 \n\n\nlV2\n\n2.0\n\n.6\n\nIV3 \n\nl V 4 (atmospheric braking) \n\n\n2.0\n\n.6\n\n0 \n\n\n0 \n\n\n9.2\n\n6.0 \n\n\nrotal propulsion required\n\nI\n\n-5.5\n\n4. 8\n\n31 \n\n\nmission profiles.

However, the comparison changes markedly if an elliptical parking orbit is\nused at Jupiter along with atmosphere braking at Earth return.\nThe AV requirement for the 1000-day Jupiter t r i p using the apo-twist parking orbit\nwith atmospheric braking at Earth return is shown in table IV. Several typical M a r s\nt r i p s are also shown. For the examples selected, the Jupiter round t r i p s show mission\nAV\'s and t r i p durations comparable to those that a r e being considered f o r M a r s .\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\n\n.\n\nThe propulsive requirements for nonstop and stopover symmetrical round trips t o\nJupiter were obtained for a number of mission durations and Jupiter stay times. Total\nt r i p times of 500 to 2200 days and stay times of 0 to 200 days were considered. Methods\nAV include optimized heliocentric travel angles, atemployed to reduce the mission\nmospheric braking at Earth return, u s e of loosely captured elliptical parking orbits at\n\n33\n\nJupiter, and rendezvous at Jupiter. Also investigated was the AV penalty associated\nwith Earth to Jupiter transfer trajectories lying out of the plane of the ecliptic. All veloc\xc2\xad\nity changes were obtained impulsively and the assumption was made that Earth and Jupiter\nlie in circular coplanar orbits. The following results were obtained:\nAV\'s calculated assuming circular coplanar planetary orbits are\n1. The mission\nwithin 5 percent of those found if allowance is made f o r eccentricity and inclination.\n2. The trajectories with the lowest propulsive velocity increment sum occurred for\nsymmetrical t r i p s (i. e. , the heliocentric travel angle and the travel time were the s a m e\nf o r the inbound and outbound legs). Symmetrical t r i p s with local minimums in\nAV oc\xc2\xad\ncur in narrow bands of t r i p durations at intervals of about 400 days between trip durations\nof 600 and 2200 days.\n3. For stopover t r i p s , the mission AV can be reduced by nearly a factor of 4 if\nelliptical parking orbits a r e used at Jupiter in place of a low circular one. For instance,\nthe AV f o r the 1000-day t r i p with a 100-day stay is reduced from 28 to 8 miles per sec\xc2\xad\nond by changing from a low circular parking orbit at Jupiter to the apo-twist orbit.\n4. Atmospheric braking at Earth return (assuming this capability exists) reduces the\ntotal mission AV by an additional 4 to 1 0 miles p e r second.\n5. At t r i p times of 1400 days and greater, nonstop round trips can be made with\nabout half the propulsive effort required for the most favorable stopover trip.\n6. An appreciable AV increase can be incurred in using nonecliptic Earth to Jupiter\ntransfers. For example, to obtain an altitude of 0. 5 astronomical unit from the ecliptic\nat 2. 8 astronomical units from the Sun, the AV penalty is 6 . 7 miles per second for the\n1000-day mission. For missions made up of Hohmann legs with 180\' transfers, the AV\npenalty can be much less but the mission times are very long.\n7. The Jupiter rendezvous mission profile can yield significant reductions in propul\xc2\xad\nsive effort for portions of the n i s s i o n mass.\n8. If the AV reducing techniques outlined in this report a r e used, stopover round\nt r i p s to Jupiter can be made with about the same propulsive effort commonly considered\nfor t r i p s to M a r s . The most favorable 1000-day t r i p to Jupiter requires a total\nAV\nof about 8 . 5 miles p e r second. This compares favorably with a X A V o 9 . 0 miles p e r\nf\nsecond found for a typical M a r s mission.\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, April 28, 1966,\n12 1-30-02-01-22.\n\n34 \n\n\nAPPENDIX - SYMBOLS\ne\n\neccentricity\n\nH\n\ndistance measured normal to\necliptic plane, AU\n\nNC\n\nNe\n\nintegral number of revolutions\nin parking circle\n\nAVt\n\nAv2, a\n\nintegral number of revolutions\nin parking ellipse\nintegral number of revolutions\nof Earth about the Sun during\ntrip\n\nP\n\nsemilatus rectum, miles\n\nR\n\nradial distance from Sun, AU\n\nr\n\nradius of trajectory, miles\n\nrrm\n\nradius of sphere of influence,\nmiles\n\nT\n\ntime\n\nV\n\ntrajectory velocity, miles/sec\n\nvH\n\nvelocity of interplanetary trajec\xc2\xad\ntory in heliocentric coordinates\nat Jupiter sphere of influence,\nmiles/s ec\n\nAV3, a\n\nAV\n\nAV\n\npropulsive velocity increment,\nmiles/sec\n\npropulsive velocity increment to\ntransfer from circle to ellipse\nwith apoapsis equal to circular\nradius, miles/sec\nAV1 + AV2 + AV3 + AV4 f o r\nall-propulsive maneuvers;\nAV1 + AV2 + AV3 for full\natmospheric braking at Earth\nreturn\n\naxes\n\nxm,y,\n\ncoordinates of intersection of\ntrajectory with Jupiter sphere\nof influence (see fig. 7)\n\nQH\n\nQ\n,\n\n~\n\npropulsive velocity increment to\ntransfer from ellipse apoapsis\nto circle of s a m e radius,\nmiles/s ec\n\nx,\nY\n\nvelocity of Jupiter in its orbit\nabout the Sun, miles/sec\nhyperbolic excess velocity, in\nplanet ocentric coordinates ,\nlocated at sphere of influence,\nmiles/sec\n\npropulsive velocity increment\napplied at apoapsis of parking\nellipse for apo- twist maneu\xc2\xad\nv e r , miles/sec\n\nP\n\npath angle of interplanetary tra\xc2\xad\njectory with respect to local\nhorizontal, deg\npath angle of hyperbolic excess\nvelocity with respect to local\nhorizontal, deg\nangle by which the hyperbolic\nexcess velocity is turned by\npropulsion, deg (see fig. 12)\n\n35 \n\n\nI I\n\nI I\n\nY\n\nI I\n\nI\n\nIll I I I\n\n1111111111111111 I\n\nII I\n\n1111\n\n111 I\n\nI\n\nangle between line of apsides of\nparking ellipse and direction\nof a r r i v a l hyperbolic excess\nvelocity vector, deg\nturning due to planet gravity,\nfrom sphere of influence to\nperiplanet, deg\nangle defining position of hyper\xc2\xad\nbolic excess velocity on sphere\nof influence, deg (see fig. 7(b))\ntrue anomaly on parking ellipse\nwhere spacecraft injects into\nparking orbit, deg\nt r u e anomaly of sphere of influ\xc2\xad\nence on planetocentric hyper\xc2\xad\nbolic trajectory, deg\nturning angle required between\na r r i v a l and departure hyper\xc2\xad\nbolic excess velocity vectors\nto perform a round trip, deg\nangle of rotation of parking orbit\nplane about line of apsides of\nparking ellips,e, deg\nplanet force constant, miles 3/\ns e c2\n\nturning angle to be supplied by\nparking orbit maneuver, deg\nheliocentric angle, deg\nmean angular velocity of planet,\ndeg/day\nSubscripts:\n\na\n\n36 \n\n\napoapsis of elliptic parking orbit\n\nI\n\nb\n\nhomebound leg, from Jupiter\nperiapsis to Earth periapsis\n\nC\n\ncircular parking orbit\n\ncl. 1\n\ncircular parking orbit at 1.1 Ju\xc2\xad\npiter radii\n\ne\n\nof elliptic trajectory\n\nH\n\nheliocentric\n\nh\n\nof hyperbolic trajectory\n\ni\n\ngeneral subscript indicating\neither 2 o r 3\n\n0 \n\n\noutbound leg, from Earth peri\xc2\xad\napsis to Jupiter periapsis\n\nOPt\n\noptimum\n\nP\n\nperiapsis\n\nS\n\nstay at Jupiter, from arrival to\ndeparture periapsis\n\nT\n\ntotal mission\n\nt\n\napo-twist parking orbit\n\n1\n\nEarth departure\n\n2\n\nJupiter arrival\n\n3\n\nJupiter departure\n\n4\n\nEarth arrival\n\na\n\n3\n\nEarth\n\nI \n\n\nJupiter\n\nc \n\na\n\nfrom sphere of influence to\nperiplanet, o r at sphere of\ninfluence\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
