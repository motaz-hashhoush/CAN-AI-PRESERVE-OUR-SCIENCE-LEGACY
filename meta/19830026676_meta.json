A Mach 2.4 CTOL aircraft was used in the study. Two missions were considered: a long range penetrator mission and a long range intercept mission. The supersonic fan engine is compared with an augmented mixed flow turbofan in terms of mission radius for a fixed takeoff gross weight of 75,000 lbm. The mission radius of aircraft powered by supersonic fan engines could be 15 percent longer than aircraft powered with conventional turbofan engines at moderate thrust to gross weight ratios. The climb and acceleration performance of the supersonic fan engines is better than that of the conventional turbofan engines.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19830026676, "endDate": "1983-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AHS"}}, "meetingId": "bb699494799e462b9708b495daed678d", "id": "ceb3d24b02334f258364934d67758df4"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "bb699494799e462b9708b495daed678d", "id": "3d422f07b91a4f21b1db53332f4c1a48"}], "name": "Aircraft Design Systems and Operations Meeting", "location": "Fort Worth, TX", "id": "bb699494799e462b9708b495daed678d", "startDate": "1983-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830026676, "id": "e3b3b6dbe86148eab7bc348aa378718b", "publicationDate": "1983-10-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830026676.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830026676/downloads/19830026676.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830026676/downloads/19830026676.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830026676/downloads/19830026676.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
