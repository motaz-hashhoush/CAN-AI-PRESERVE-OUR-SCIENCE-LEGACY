A new hypothesis is suggested: During the end of Lower Pleistocene, a comet of special components from the outer part of the Solar System approached the Earth, and then it was captured by the Earth, when it came approximately to the Roche's limet. It was crushed into countless fragments, detritus and dusts, which rotated around the Earth, probably far above the Earth's atmosphere, as a cloud ring. Under the action of crushing energy they could be in the situation of liquid-melt drop in the almost vacuum circumstances and the flow and bubble structure were formed. During their rotation the climate became anomalous and the violet Fe-Si concentration were formed on the surface of sediments. After a rather short time of rotation the unstable ring was broken and the fragments impacted on the hard ground instantaneously.", "title": "New approach to the origin of the tektite in China", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890012043, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Qin-Wen, Zhang"}, "organization": {"name": "Academia Sinica", "location": "Beijing, China"}}, "id": "202f7d04e0c1465b9bc2879c7088c7ec"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890012043, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dao-Yi, XU"}, "organization": {"name": "Academia Sinica", "location": "Beijing, China"}}, "id": "a3892c897364424695be7101539cb027"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890012043, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zheng, Yan"}, "organization": {"name": "Academia Sinica", "location": "Beijing, China"}}, "id": "29c0152583a342068b8be420cdb93834"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890012043, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890012043, "id": "10128b0a46ad4189a57e4f990f6ca921", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst., Global Catastrophes in Earth History: An Interdisciplinary Conference on Impacts, Volcanism, and Mass Mortality", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890012043.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890012043/downloads/19890012043.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890012043/downloads/19890012043.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890012043/downloads/19890012043.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
