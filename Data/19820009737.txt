The\nadd-on price goal for the web process is $38.6O/u 4 or $0.29/Wp at an\nencapsulated cell efficiency of 14.0X. This is consistent with the FSA\nProject price goal of $0.70/Wp (1980 $) for photovoltaic modules with\nefficiency of 13.3X.\nThe present study performs a sensitivity analysis of the process add-on\nprice in terms of cost parameters such as equipment, space, direct labor,\nmaterials and utilities, and production parameters such as growth rate and run\nlength. The sensitivity analysis is also performed with respect to silicon\nprice, sheet thickness and cell efficiency. The computer program developed\nspecifically for doing the sensitivity analysis with Interim Price Estimation\nGuidelines (IPEG) is used in this study.\nThe add-on price for the process is estimated at $22.82/0 2 , based on\nthe data provided by WRDC for the projected web technology. The breakdown of\nthe add-on price of $22.82/2 2 in terms of the cost parameters indicates that\nthe primary cost driver is direct labor, which contributes 37.5)% of the price\nwith the assumption of 18 furnaces per operator (FPO). The sensitivity\nanalysis shows that b varying the FPO from 6 to 24 the price is reduced from\n$39.97/m2 to $20.67/2 and the corresponding direct-labor contribution is\nsubstantially reduced, from 64% to 31%. By increasing the FPO to 30, the\nprice and labor contribution are reduced to $19.39/2 2 and 26.54%, respectively,\nwhich is of marginal benefit. Contribution of equipment cost to the price is\n33.72%, which is nearly equivalent to that of direct labor.\nThe web technology has been developed remarkably by Westinghouse R&D\nCenter during the last five years. No serious technical problems are foreseen\nin meeting the Technical Readiness goal of $0.70/Wp. Several conceptual\napproaches exist to enhance this technology further, leading to a $0.50/Wp\nlevel. Research and development efforts required for this should be initiated\nsoon.\n\nv\n\n\t\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nCONTENTS\n\n.\t\n\n1\n\n.\t\n\nI.\t\n\nINTRODUCTION . . .\t\n\nII,\t\n\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING IPEG (SAIPEG) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nA.\t\n\nPRICE ESTIMATION . . . . . . . . . . \t\n\nB.\t\n\nINPUT DATA . . . . . .\t\n\nC.\t\n\nPRODUCTION . . . .\t\n\nD.\t\n\nEQUIPMENT\t\n\nE.\t\n\nAREA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \t\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\n4\n\n.\t\n\n4\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n6\n\n. .\t\n\n7\n\nF.\t\n\nDIRECT LABOR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \t\n\n7\n\nG.\t\n\nMATERIAL . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n7\n\nH.\t\n\nUTILITIES\t\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n8\n\n. . . . . . . . .\t\n\nIII.

The\nproject goals are to achieve Technical Readiness for producing photovoltaic\nmodules at the price of $0.70/W by 1982, and to achieve Commercial Readiness\nby 1986. (All monetary figures p in this document are in 1980 dollars.)\nDeveloping the technology for manufacturing large-area silicon sheets is\none of the tasks in the Technology Development Area of the FSA Project. Several sheet-growth technologies are being developed in parallel under this task;\nthe silicon web growth process is one of them. The Westinghouse R&D Center\n(WROC) has been working on web process development for the FM Project since\n1974.\nThe web process is described briefly thus: Polycrystalline silicon, as\npellets or in similar form, is fed into a quartz crucible and is melted by\nheating the crucible in a furnace. The furnace consists of a molybdenum\nsusceptor and heat shields. The growth process is initiated from a thin wirelike seed, which is brought into contact with the molten metal in the crucible\nthrough a slot in the susceptor cover. The seed front grows laterally to form\na button. The seed is withdrawn and dendrites continue from the ends of the\nbutton in the melt. The web is formed by the solidification of the liquid\nfilm formed between the dendrites and the button. The width reaches a steady\nstate determined by the thermal conditions in the melt. The ribbon is withdrawn and rolled on a reel. Thickness, width and growth rate are functions of\nthe dimensions of the slot in the susceptor cover and the thermal factors.\nMuch attention has been given to automating the process to minimize the\ndirect labor requirement. It will be shown below that direct labor is web\'s\nprimary cost driver, contributing 38% of the add-on price of the process.\nAccordit,g to the Price Allocation Guidelines (Reference 1), the add-on\nprice goal for the web process is $38.6/0 2 . At the present level of demonstrated technology, the price estimate is several tines higher than the goal.\nA detailed cost analysis (References 2 and 3) was done by WRDC (1978 to\n1980) using an earlier version of the Interim Price Estimation Guidelines\n(IPEG) (Reference 4). The results of the previous studies are updated, the\ncomputation of direct labor cost has been improved and the more recent version\nof IPEG (Reference 5) is used in the present study.\nIt is desirable to perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated price\nin tern: of production rate and cost parameters. Given the add-on price of\nthe web process, based on WRDC projected data, the sensitivity analysis is\nper:ormed with respect to silicon price, sheet thickness and cell efficiency.\nSAIPEG, a computer program especially developed to pe. forms the sensitivity\n\n1\n\nanalysis, using 1PEG 9 is used in this study. The results will aid in\nidentifying the primary cost drivers and the sensitivity range of variations in\nthe important parameters. This information will help in setting the direction\nof future technology development efforts.\n\nSECTION II\nSENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING IPEG (SAIPEG)\nThe add-on price of any standard assembly-line process is estimated by\nusing the SAMICS (Reference 6) procedure and the SAMIS (Reference 7) program\ndeveloped by JPL. The computer cost of using SARIS is on the order of $100\nper run. The use of SAMICS/SARIS procedure for doing a sensitivity analysis\nof a process involving large numbers of runs is therefore prohibitively\nexpensive. The price estimation using the IPEG procedure is considered to be\nof sufficient accuracy to do the sensitivity analysis.\nSAIPEG is a computer program (written in FORTRAN) for doing the sensitivity analysis using IPEG; the SAIPEG procedure is described below.\nA.\t\n\nPRICE ESTIMATION\n\nThe IPEG2 (improved version of IPEG, Reference 5) equation used in the\ncurrent study is:\nAMC \xe2\x80\xa2 Cl x EQPT + C2 x AREA + C3 x DLAB + C4 x (MATS + UTIL) \t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nAMC\t\n\nM\t\n\nEQPT\t\n\nM\t\n\nAREA\t\n\nM\t\n\nAnnual Manufacturing Cost ($/yr).

The sensitivity\nanalysis is performed with respect either to the production rate or to any of\nthe cost parameters, varied one at a time with the rest of the data held\nconstant. The production rate and the cost parameters in turn are varied by\nchanging some of the basic input parameters, as described below. Given the\nprocess add-on price, the sensitivity analysis is performed by varying the\nsilicon price, and other parameters such as sheet thickness and cell efficiency.\n\nA.\n\nPRODUCTION RATE\n\nThe production rate is varied by changing any of tie two basic parameters: (a) run length (RNLNHR) and (b) growth rate (cm /min). For the\nfixed value of RNLNHR, the growth rate is changed from a specified minimum\nvalue to a specified maximum value with a desired increment. For each value\nof the growth rate, the add-on price is computed and growth rate vs add-on\nprice is plotted. The procedure is repeated for each RNLNHR specified. The\nresults for the exauple studied are discussed below.\nB.\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nThe contribution of equipment to AMC is calculated by varying (a) equipment lifetime and (b) equipment cost. For a given lifetime of equipment, the\nequipment cost (EQPT) is varied from a minimum value to a maximum value with\nspecified increments. For each value of equipment cost the add-on price is\nestimated and the graph of equipment cost vs add-on price is plotted. The\nprocedure is repeated for all of the values of equipment life of interest.\n\nC.\n\nAREA, MATERIAL, AND UTILITIES\n\nFor each of these cost parameters the corresponding contributions to AMC\nare varied from minimum to maximum values with specified increments. The addon price is estimated for each value of a parameter and parameter ve add-on\nprice is plotted. Sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to one parameter at a time.\nD.\n\nDIRECT LABOR\n\nThe contribution of DLAB to AMC is varied by changing two of the basic\ninput parameters: (a) labor pay rate (PRTLB), and (b) the number of furnaces\noperated per operator (FPO). For a specified PRTLB, FPO is varied from a\nminimum to the specified maximum with desired increments. For each value of\nFPO, add-on price is computed and FPO vs add-on price is plotted. The procedure is repeated for each value bf PRTLB of interest.\n\nE.\t\n\nSILICON PRICE\n\nThe add-on price of the web silicon sheet process ($/m 2 ) is computed\nignoring the cost of iilicon. The total price of sheet should include the\ncost of silicon material. The Silicon Material Task of the FSA Project is\nworking on the problem of reducing the silicon price. The sensitivity\nanalysis is performed by varying the silicon price. Other parameters varied\nare sheet thickness and cell efficiency. For the fixed value of sheet\nthickness and cell efficiency, the add-on price is computed in terms of $/Wp\nand silicon price vs add-on price is plotted. The procedure is repeated for\neach combination of sheet thickness and cell efficiency specified.\nThe total add-on price for sheet is computed as follows:\nPR1 = WFP/(INSC x ECE x CY)\nPR2 = SIP x TH x CONF x SILDN/(INSC x ECE x CY x SWY)\nPRICE - PRI + PR2\nwhe re\nWFP\t\n\n=\t\n\nWeb sheet process add-on price in $/m2.\n\nINSC\t\nECE\t\n\nEncapsulated cell efficiency.\n\nCY\t\n\nSheet to cell yield.\n\nSWY\t\n\nSilicon to sheet yield.\n\nSILDN\t\n\nSilicon density (2330 kg/m3).\n\nCONF\t\n\nConversion factor for converting mils to meters\n(0.0000254).\n\nTH\t\n\nSheet thickness in mils.\n\nSIP\t\n\nSilicon price in ($/kg).\n\nPRI\t\n\nWeb process add-on price in $/Wp.\n\nPR2\t\n\nSilicon material add-on price in $1W p*\n\nPRICE\t\n\n_\t\n\nInsolation constant (assumed to be 1000 W/m2).\n\nTotal sheet add-on price in $/W p including cost of\nsilicon.\n\nIt may be noted that the sensitivity analysis with respect to any of the\ncost parameters can be repeated for each value of the DTCY and PRYL and their\nspecific combination of interest. Data and the results are discussed in the\nnext section.\n\n12\n\n1\n\nSECTION IV\nSAIPEG SESULTS FOR\n\nTHE WEB PROCE88\n\nData for the economic analysis of the web process are being generated\nand continuously updated, based on technology development experience. Westinghouse R&D Center has demonstrated ribbon growth as wide as 4.4 cm and growth\nspeeds as high as 6.7 cm/min. Melt replenishment has been incorporated in the\ndesign of the furnace. A machine capable of growing ribbon 5 cm wide at a\nspeed of 5 cm/min is being developed. The base-case data provided in Table 1\nreflect the projected values for a machine of desired production rate. The\ndata have been grouped by production rate and the five cost parameters.\nIPEG price estimation results based on the base-case data of Table 1 are\npresented in Table 2. It is estimated that 1140.75 m2 of silicon sheet would\nbe produced per machine per year at a cost of $26,031, resulting in an add-on\nprice of $22.82/m 2 . The composition of AMC in terms of the cost parameters\nand the corresponding coefficients are given in Table 2. The add-on price\nbreakdown in terms of cost parameter contributions is presented in Table 2.\nDirect labor is the primary cost driver, contributing 38% of the add-on price;\nutilities contribute only 5%. The contribution of equipment cost is 34% of\nthe add-on price, and the contributions of area and materials are 12% and 11%\nrespectively.\nThe estimated add-on prig of $22.82/m 2 with the projected data is below\nthe FSA Project goal of $38.6/m for the web process. If technical development is achieved according to the projections, the web process more than meets\nthe project goals. Because of the inherent uncertainty of such projections,\nthe sensitivity of the add-on price with respect to the production rate, the\ncost parameters, and the silicon price is of interest. The results of the\nsensitivity analysis are presented below.\n\nA.\t\n\nPRODUCTION RATE\n\nFor this analysis, run length is varied from 1 day to 5 days with 1-day\nincrements. Growth rate is varied from 10 cm 2 /min to 40 cm2 /min with increments of 5 cm2 /min. The base-case datum for run length is 3 days and for the\ngrowth rate is 25 cm2 /min. The variation of run length in turn affects the\nnumber of furnaces operated by one operator. The furnaces are in automatic\ngrowth mode during most of the time of run length. The operator uses his time\nperforming two functions: (a) cleaning, loading and start of growth, and\n(b) surveillance of furnaces in automatic mode. The time required for\nfunction (a) per furnace per run is assumed to be 2 hours. If an operator\nstarts two furnaces per shift he uses his time equally for functions (a) and\n(b) and at the end of one day six furnaces will be operating. If the run\nlength is 3 days, furnaces per operator (FPO) u.11 be 18 and FPO will be 24\nand 30 for run lengths of 4 and 5 days, respectively. It is assumed that 4\nhours of operators time per shift will be enough for function (b) for FPO as\nhigh as 30. For shorter run lengths of 1 and 2 days, FPO will be 6 and 12\nrespectively and the time used for function (b) becomes excessive. For run\n\n13\n\nlength of one day, 3 furnaces can be started per shift and FPO can be 9\ninstead of 6. The saes: holds for run length of 2 days. FPO of 15 is also\nconsidered assuming that 2.5 machines are started per shift. All of these\ncases have been considered in the analysis. The results of add-on price ve\narea growth rate with run length as a parameter are shown in Figure 1.\nIt is observed in Figure I that the price goal is mat with growth rate\nas lowas 15 cm /min for run length of 3 days. Area growth rates of 36\ncm /min and 28.5cm /min for FPO 6 and 9, respectively, will be necessary\nto meet the price goal for run length of I day. For run length of 1 to 3\ndays, the process is labor-intensive, with labor cost contributing to 602 to\n38% of the price, respectively. If the run length is increased to 5 days, the\nlabor contribution is reduced to 272. For run length of 4 days, the add-on\nprice variation with FPO 22 or 24 is negligible. Similarly, for run length of\n5 days, the add-on price variation is not significant when FPO is changed from\n25 to 30. It is observed that the curves are asymptotic. For run length of\nthree days or more, the reduction in add-on price for a growth rate more than\n30 cm2 /min is marginal. WRDC has demonstrated both web width of 5 cm and\ngrowth rate of 5 cm/min, but not simultaneously except for a short period.\nsteady state of growth for run\nEfforts should be concentrated on achieving\nlengths as long as 3 days at a rate of 25 cm I\n/min.\n\nB.\n\nCOST OF EQUIPMENT\n\nThe cost of equipment for the base-case data in Table 1 is $15,400 and\nthe lifetime of the equipment is 7 years. It is observed in Table 2 that\nnearly one third of the add-on price is contributed by the equipment cost.\nEquipment cost should be reduced if possible. The cost of equipment is varied\nby considering the life of equipment to be 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years; for\neach of the assumed lifetimes the cost varies from $5,000 to $30,000, with\nincrements of $5,000. The graph of add-on price va equipment cost is shown in\nFigure 2. For equipment of 3 years\' lifetime, cost can be as high as $30,000\nand still meet the goal. For equipment of more than 3 years lifetime, the\ncost can be higher than $30,000 and still meet the goal.\n\nC.\n\nAREA, MATERIALS AND UTILITIES COSTS\n\nThe base-case value for area is 30 ft 2 per mach\', contributing 12% of\nthe add-on price. Area required is varied from 10 ft to 60 ft . The graph\nof area vs add-on price is given in Figure 3. The area can be increased to 60 ft2\nwithout exceeding the price goal.\nThe cost of material: for the base case is $2,306, contributing only 11%\n-of the add-on price. The graph of materials cost vs add-on price is shown in\nFigure 4. For materials cost as high as $4,000, the add-on price is still\nbelow the price goal.\nThe base-case data give $1,193 as utilities cost, contributing only 5%\nto the add-on price. The add-on price is least influenced by this parameter.\n\n14\n\n84\n\nGROWTH CYCLE\n\nMACHINES\n\n(RUN LENGTH)\n\nPER OPERATOR\n(MPO)\n\nA\n\nDAYS\n\n70\n\nA\t\n\n1\n\n6\n\nA\'\t\n\n1\n\n9\n\nB\t\n\n12\n\n2\n\n15\n\nC\t\n\n3\n\n18\n\nD\t\n\n4\n\n24\n\nE\t\n\nA,\n60\n\n2\n\nB\'\t\n\n5\n\n30\n\n50\nNE\nI\nW\n\na\n\n40\n\no\ni\nD\nD\nQ\nC\n\n30\n\nWEB PROCESS\nADD-ON\nPRICE GOAL:\nS38.6/m 2\n\nD\nE\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n0\t\n\n10\t\n\n15\t\n\n20\t\n\n25\t\n\n30\t\n\n35\t\n\n40\n\nGROWTH RATE (cm 2/min)\n\nFigure 1.

Add - on Price Web vs Process Direct Materiel Cost\n\n18\n\n4000\n\nThe utilities cost varies from $300 to $3,000; the graph of utility cost vs\nadd-on price is given in Figure 3. It ray be observed that the utilities cost\ncan go as high as $3,000 without exceeding the goal.\nD.\n\nDIAECT\n\nLABOR COST\n\nThe base-case data have shown that direct labor is the primary cost\ndriver, contributing 382 of the add-on price. The direct labor cost is a\nfunction of the labor pay rate and the amber of furnaces operated by a single\noperator. The base case assumes an operator pay rate of $6.30/h (excluding\nfrank.:; hsnefits) with one worker operating 18 furnaces. For the sensitivity analysis, the labor pay rate is varied from $5/h to $9/h (excluding\nfringe bene!fics . The number of furnaces operated by a single operator\n(FPO) is varied from 6 to 36 for each labor pay rate considered. The graph.w\nof FPO vs !add-on price are shown in Figure G. It say be observed that the\ncost of direct labor is reduced considerably when FPO is increased from 6 to\n24. The incremental decrease in the add-on price for FPO greater than 24 is\nnegligible, as the curves are asymptotic. This suggests that efforts to automate the equipment in order to increase FPO should be limited to achieve FPO\nbetween 24 and 30. There is not such control over the labor pay rate, which\nis governed by external factors. Automation reduces the skills required and\nreduces the labor cost. For FPO of 18 the price goal is not with a labor pay\nrate of more than $9/h. It is also shown that the price goal is not set with\nFPO of 6 and labor pay rate is low as $6.30/h.\n\nE.\n\nSILICON\n\nPRICE\n\nThe total add-on price of silicon sheet is the sus of the add-on price\nof the sheet process and of silicon material. The add-on price of the web\nprocess in : ca t is converted to $/Wp with the known value of the insolation\nconstant, sheet-to-cell yield and oucapsulated cell efficiency. The add-on\nprice of silicon in the cell in f.\'ip is dependent (in addition to the above\nparameters) on sheet thickness and on silicon-to-sheet yield. For the purpose\nof the current study, the silicon-to-sheet yield is assumed to be a constant\n902 and sheet to cell yield is assumed to be a constant 95%. The thickness of\nthe sheet is varied from 2 mile to 8 ails with increments of 2 ails and the\nencapsulated cell efficiencies considered are 102 to 15%. Silicon price is\nvaried from =15/kg to =85/kg with increments of 65/kg. For a given sheet\nthickness, the plot of silicon price vs add-on price in =/W is drawn with\ncell efficiency as a parameter. The results are presented in Figures 7a, 7b,\n7c, and 7d for sheet thicknesA-s of 2 ails, 4 ails, 6 ails and 8 si:s respectively.\nIt is observed that with sheet 2 ails thick (Figure 7a), the price goal\nis achieved with 102-efficient cells for silicon prices as high as $75/kg.\nFor higher-efficiency cells 2 ails thick, the silicon price will not interfere\nwi0:: achieving the goal. Four-ails-thick cells would achieve the goal with\n102 celi efficiency and silicon price of =35/kg (Figure 7b); for 4-ails-thick\ncells with 1 41 or aoce efficiency, the silicon price is not a problem. For\nthe 6-ail-thick sheet and cell efficiency of 10x, the price of silicon aunt\nnot be more than 624/kg in order to achieve the goal (Figure 7c). With cells\nS ails thick with 152 efficiency, the silicon price can be as high as WAS.\nWith 8-ails-thick cello mad 102 efficiency, the silicon price should not be\n19\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\nN\nM\ntW,\nZ\n\nIf 20\nZ\n\nR\n15\n\n10\n\nS\n\n0\n\n\t\n\n500\t\n\n1000\t\n\n150.3\t\n\n2000\t\n\n2500\t\n\nUTILITIES COST (UTIL) (S)\nFigure S.

It is conceivable that\nthe web process will not just achieve the goal of $0.70/Wp, but surpass it.\nThis technology has the potential of bringing the module price down to $0.50/Wp\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n26\n\nSECTION V\nCONMUS IONS\n\nThe projected input data set for economic analysis by IPEG indicates that\nthe add-on price goals can be easily met if all of the assumptions implied in\nthe inpi:t data set are achieved. The ribbon-growth equipment is expected to\noperate on a continuous basis with melt replenishment, growing one ribbon 5 cm\nwide, at the rate of 5 cm/min. Each of these parameters, such as ribbon width\nand growth rate, has been shown to achieve the desired values independently.\nHowever, continuous steady growth of web at desired widths, speed, and run\nlengths has not been achieved. Efforts are being directed toward achieving\nthis in order to attain Technical Readiness.\nThe add-on price breakdown indicates that the cost of direct labor is\nthe primary cost driver, contributing 38% of the price; the cost of utilities\nis the weakest cost driver, contributing only 5% of the price. Efforts should\ntherefore be directed to reduce the labor requirement by increasing automation.\nThe sensitivity analysis indicates that it does not pay significantly to\nincrease the number of furnaces tended by an operator to more than 24. The\nequipment cost contributes one third of the add-on price. It is worthwhile to\nwork on minimizing that cost. For 6-in.-thick web sheet and 15% encapsulated\ncell efficiency, the silicon price can be as high as $65/kg and still meet the\nprice goal. By achieving growth of thinner sheets and lower prices for\nsilicon, the web process technology can meet a $0.50/W p goal.\nThe SAIPEG analysis is helpful in understanding the relative importance\nof the cost parameters and the add-on price sensitivity to each of them. This\nknowledge would be useful in planning efforts to improve the most sensitive\ncost parameters. The SAIPEG analysis should be performed on a continuous\nbasis when results dictate modification of base-case input data.\n\n27\n\nPRECEDIN PAGE BLANK NOT\n\nREFERENCES\n\n(I) Aster, R.
