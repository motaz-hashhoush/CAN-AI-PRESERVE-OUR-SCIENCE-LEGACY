b'Industrial Productivity/Manufacturing Technology\n\n104\n\nGoing End to End to Deliver High-Speed Data\nOriginating Technology/\nNASA Contribution\n\nB\n\ny the end of the 1990s, the optical fiber\n\xe2\x80\x9cbackbone\xe2\x80\x9d of the telecommunication and\ndata-communication networks had evolved\nfrom megabits-per-second transmission rates to gigabitsper-second transmission rates. Despite this boom in\nbandwidth, however, users at the end nodes were still\nnot being reached on a consistent basis. (An end node is\nany device that does not behave like a router or a managed hub or switch. Examples of end node objects are\ncomputers, printers, serial interface processor phones, and\nunmanaged hubs and switches.)\nThe primary reason that prevents bandwidth from\nreaching the end nodes is the complex local network topology that exists between the optical backbone and the end\nnodes. This complex network topology consists of several\nlayers of routing and switch equipment which introduce\npotential congestion points and network latency.\n\nBy breaking down the complex network topology, a\ntrue optical connection can be achieved. Access Optical\nNetworks, Inc., is making this connection a reality with\nguidance from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s nondestructive evaluation experts.\n\nPartnership\nNaperville, Illinois-based Access Optical is a fabless semiconductor and optical component subsystem\nmanufacturer. (Fabless refers to a company that does not\nmanufacture its own silicon wafers and concentrates on\nthe design and development of semiconductor chips.) It\ndevelops and delivers value-added, high-speed, optical-todigital transducers that directly connect digital computers to local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks\n(WAN), as well as metro and long haul networks. These\nproducts provide true end-to-end optical connections\nbetween server, database host, and LAN domains as highspeed peripheral devices.\n\nWhile searching for opportunities to run proof-ofconcept tests on a new router/switch optical memory\nstorage system, Access Optical encountered a team of\nnondestructive evaluation researchers at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn\nResearch Center. These researchers saw that the highspeed, multi-gigabit and multi-terabit data-transfer capabilities of Access Optical\xe2\x80\x99s storage system had potential\nto enhance a laser-holographic technique they use; this\ntechnique involves neural networks to analyze patterns\nin holographic images. Such data-intensive computation can be a slow process, but the company\xe2\x80\x99s technology\nshowed promise in speeding up the analysis and improving output.\nAn award from the NASA Illinois Commercialization\nCenter\xe2\x80\x94Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s link to Illinois businesses\xe2\x80\x94helped initiate the partnership between Access Optical and Glenn,\nso that the new technology could be proof-tested with\nhelp from the nondestructive evaluation team. For Access\nOptical, this \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology fusion experiment\xe2\x80\x9d with NASA\nprovided a specific application on which to focus its\nefforts, valuable insight into product modifications and\nproduct integration, and the financial means to expand as\na successful company.\nNASA is now looking at Access Optical\xe2\x80\x99s highspeed data-processing capability for application in\nother areas, especially those supporting the Vision for\nSpace Exploration.\n\nProduct Outcome\n\nAccess Optical Networks, Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s end-to-end optical technology not only allows a server to tie directly to an optical area network,\nbut also of\xef\xac\x82oads Internet protocol stack operations. This provides a signi\xef\xac\x81cant improvement in server performance\nby freeing up central processing unit (CPU) cycles, reducing system interruptions, and eliminating memory overhead and\nprocessor latency.\n\nNow a concept turned reality, Access Optical\xe2\x80\x99s AlphaOmega ( A \xce\xa9) family of optical peripheral equipment\nresolves data rate mismatches between high-speed optical\ncarrier-grade networks and the digital computer bus interfaces with high-speed, high-density shared memory, and\nsimple bus protocols. According to the company, these\nresolutions can be achieved at a cost that is 60-percent\nlower than competitor solutions.\nThe A\xce\xa9 optical peripheral units are platform computer\ninterface products with interchangeable network interface\n\nIndustrial Productivity/Manufacturing Technology\n\nAccess Optical Networks, Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s next-generation access point solution.\n\ncards for optical SONET (Synchronous Optical Network\nTechnologies) or optical Ethernet protocol network\nconnections. Currently, corporate servers and computer\ninterfaces rely on disbursement networks, which consist\nof several layers of routing and switching equipment, to\ngain access to Ethernet and SONET long haul networks.\nThese disbursement networks add several \xe2\x80\x9chop\xe2\x80\x9d junctures\nand introduce congestion points, thus, diminishing bandwidth. With the A\xce\xa9 units, bandwidth is increased, disbursement networks are flattened, and congestion points\nare eliminated.\n\nAccess Optical\xe2\x80\x99s A\xce\xa9 products also perform routing\nfunctions that allow customers to configure point-topoint and point-to-multipoint transmissions using ring\nand mesh network topologies. Such configurations translate into peer-to-peer server, workstation, and client/server\nsub-networks directly connected or seamlessly interconnected via LAN/WAN, metro, and/or long haul networks.\nConsequently, the devices provide maximum utilization\nof bandwidth between computers connected via communication networks while eliminating the need for intermediate network equipment (e.g., routers, asynchronous\n\n105\n\ntransfer modes, and cross-point switches) to aggregate\ndata traffic and manage intermediate communication\nprotocols. They use a single protocol over a broad range\nof megabits and terabits that scales to meet the customer\xe2\x80\x99s\nneed to change or grow the capacity of their network.\nThe A\xce\xa9 technology provides maximum benefits to\ncustomers who have high-capacity streaming data applications, such as Wavelength Services, Storage Area Network\n(SAN)/Network Attached Storage (NAS), and Internet\nService Provider (ISP) in the private sector. Other customers can use the products to build high-reliability\nring and meshed networks that Access Optical asserts\nare \xe2\x80\x9cultra secure.\xe2\x80\x9d The company also notes that its A\xce\xa9\nsolutions can result in a 30- to 50-percent reduction in\nthe customer network architecture hierarchy, eliminating\nmultiple vendors, equipment, protocol integration, and\nreducing operations, administration, maintenance, and\nprovisioning (OAM&P).\nAccess Optical maintains that the A \xce\xa9 products\nwill provide protocol scalability that will integrate\neasily within existing communication networks, while offloading the computing resources vital to applications and\nmission-critical functions. This is especially important,\nas all communications\xe2\x80\x94Earth or space\xe2\x80\x94need to have\ncommon high-speed systems that are extremely secure\nand scalable.\nThe test bed research performed with NASA has additionally led Access Optical to develop a second product\nline called the Sigma-Epsilon (\xce\xa3\xce\x95) Bridge. The soon-tobe-available technology could extend a LAN\xe2\x80\x99s topology to\nmultiple geographic sites through a direct connection to\nWAN or metropolitan area network (MAN) optical transport networks. By providing a LAN this direct optical\nconnection, bandwidth could be increased and transport\nnetwork costs could be reduced. \xe2\x9d\x96\n\n'
