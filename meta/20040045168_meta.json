To achieve these objectives, NASA 757 flight test research was conducted at the Eagle-Vail, Colorado airport to evaluate three SVS display types (Head-up Display, Head-Down Size A, Head-Down Size X) and two terrain texture methods (photo-realistic, generic) in comparison to the simulated Baseline Boeing-757 Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator and Navigation/Terrain Awareness and Warning System displays. The results of the experiment showed significantly improved situation awareness, performance, and workload for SVS concepts compared to the Baseline displays and confirmed the retrofit capability of the Head-Up Display and Size A SVS concepts. The research also demonstrated that the tunnel guidance display concept used within the SVS concepts achieved required navigation performance (RNP) criteria.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040045168, "id": "174a5589783d454cb0f57aae1670e31c", "publicationDate": "2004-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040045168.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040045168/downloads/20040045168.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040045168/downloads/20040045168.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040045168/downloads/20040045168.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
