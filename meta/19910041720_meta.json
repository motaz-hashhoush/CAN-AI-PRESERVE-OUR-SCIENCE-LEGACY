Results demonstrate that the global thermohaline cell associated with the formation and export of North Atlantic deep water (NADW) is closed primarily by a 'cold water path' in which deep water leaving the Atlantic ultimately returns as intermediate water entering the basin through Drake Passage. This conclusion conflicts with the suggestion by Gordon (1986) that the global thermohaline circulation associated with the formation of NADW is closed primarily by a 'warm water path', in which the export of NADW is compensated by an inflow of warm Indian Ocean thermocline water south of Africa.", "title": "South Atlantic interbasin exchange", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T18:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910041720, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rintoul, Stephen Rich"}, "organization": {"name": "MIT", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "42df1d91eb4045c5862f10bf6ae4fc3f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910041720, "publications": [{"volume": "96", "submissionId": 19910041720, "issn": "0148-0227", "id": "ed4a9b7177084baca71ab94ca1e8e001", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1991-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
