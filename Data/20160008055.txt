Lowfrequency radio signals can propagate long distances\naround the globe via repeated reflections off of the\nionosphere and the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Higher frequency\nradio signals can punch through the ionosphere to be\nreceived at orbiting satellites. However, any turbulence\nin the ionosphere can distort these signals, compromising the performance or even availability of space-based\ncommunication and navigations systems.\nThe physics associated with this distortion effect is\nanalogous to the situation when underwater images are\ndistorted by convecting air bubbles. In fact, these ionospheric features are often called \xe2\x80\x98plasma bubbles\xe2\x80\x99 since\nthey exhibit some of the similar behavior as underwater air bubbles. These events, instigated by solar and\ngeomagnetic storms, can cause communication and\nnavigation outages that last for hours. To help understand and predict these outages, a world-wide community of space scientists and technologists are devoted\nto researching this topic. One aspect of this research is\nto develop instruments capable of measuring the ionospheric plasma bubbles.\n\n142\n\nFigure 1 shows a photo of the Charge Analyzer Responsive to Local Oscillations (CARLO), a new instrument\nunder development at NASA Marshall Space Flight\nCenter (MSFC). It is a frequency-domain ion spectrum\nanalyzer designed to measure the distributions of ionospheric turbulence from 1 Hz to 10 kHz (i.e., spatial\nscales from a few kilometers down to a few centimeters). This frequency range is important since it focuses\non turbulence scales that affect VHF/UHF satellite communications, GPS systems, and over-the-horizon radar\nsystems. CARLO is based on the flight-proven Plasma\nLocal Anomalous Noise Environment (PLANE) instrument, previously flown on a U.S. Air Force low-Earth\norbiting satellite, which successfully measured ion\nturbulence in five frequency decades from 0.1\xc2\xa0 Hz to\n10 kHz (fig 2).\n\nFigure 1: CARLO engineering unit.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\nCARLO was designed to foster the plug-n-play development approach for rapid/modular spacecraft development. An overview of the CARLO assembly appears in\nfigure 3. CARLO\xe2\x80\x99s new features include an additional\ncapability to measure turbulence in temperature, an\nincrease in frequency resolution to 20 passbands, its\nown microprocessor for onboard spectral analysis, and\nstandard mechanical, electrical, and telemetry interfaces to the CubeSat platform.\n\nRelative Spectral Power\n\n4\n\nf=10\n\nTotal\nRam\n\n2 Hz\n\n0\n1 f=100\n0.5 Hz\n0\n0.4\n\nf=1.0\n0.2 kHz\n\n0\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nFrequency of PLANE Turbulence Monitor\n25 Jan 2010\n\n16:30:00\n\n17:00:00\n\n17:30:00\n\n18:00:00\n\n16:30:00\n\n17:00:00\n\n17:30:00\n\n18:00:00\n\nMPACS\nOff\n16:30:00\n\n17:00:00\n\n17:30:00\n\n18:00:00\n\nUniversal Time\n\nFigure 2: Data from CARLO\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor.

For terrestrial missions, appropriate platforms include sounding rocket,\nInternational Space Station external, CubeSats, suborbital reusable launch vehicle external flight, and other\nspacecraft that sample the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s ionosphere from\n50 km through 1,000 km in altitude.\n\nIn 2014, the CARLO sensor heads passed their functional testing when exposed to a wide range of ion densities and drift energies in two separate MSFC plasma\nchambers. Since the CARLO instrument was selected\nby the InterAmerican University (IAU) in Puerto\nRico as the primary science payload for the IAU\xe2\x80\x99s 3U\nCubeSat, it is anticipated this mission will serve as the\nheritage flight for this instrument. The IAU CubeSat is\nbeing developed for a low-Earth orbit mission, which\nwill allow the CARLO to be used (with other data and\nmodels) to investigate ionospheric-magnetospheric\ncoupling mechanisms.\n\n'
