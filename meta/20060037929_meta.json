Consequently space science projects and proposals  have been under pressure and seemingly will continue to be pressured for some years into the future. A new concept for space science funding is underway at JPL. A partnership has been  arranged with a commercial, for-profit, company that proposes to implement a (bandwidth-on-demand) information and telephone system through a network of low earth orbiting satellites  (LEO). This network will consist of almost 1000 satellites operating in polar orbit at Ka-band. JPL has negotiated an agreement with this company that each satellite will also carry one  or more science instruments for astrophysics, astronomy, and for earth observations. This paper discussed the details of the arrangement and the financial arrangements. It describes the  technical parameters, such as the 60 GHz wideband inter-satellite links and the frequency, time, and position control, on which the science is based, and it also discusses the  complementarity of this commercially funded space science with conventional space science.", "title": "(abstract) Space Science with Commercial Funding", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060037929, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/33157", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060037929, "id": "96a2d0e63f3b4a9b9c4f97ce45b26828", "publicationDate": "1994-10-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
