Included in this change are baseline requirements for experiment\ndata return for a rescue of SL-3, and also updated rendezvous information for rescue of SL-3.\nB. All weight reflected in Section 2.3.4.4, except those for medical\ncontents of the IMSS, fecal/vomitus material, and those for Experiment SO15, were derived from Reference 4.\nC. Section 2.3.4.5 Experiment Data Stowage Guidelines for Rescue of the\nSL-4 Crew will be baselined after completion of the SL-3 mission.\n\nA\n\n1.0\n1.1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Skylab (SL) Program objectives are to extend the duration of\nmanned space flight and to carry out a broad spectrum of experimental\ninvestigations. Of particular importance are a series of medical experiments associated with the extension of manned space flight, a series of\nhigh resolution solar astronomy experiments at the short wavelengths not\ndirectly observable from the surface of the earth, and a series of earth\nsurvey experiments.\nThe Skylab Program includes three low earth orbit missions designed\nto support these objectives. These missions are designated SL-1/SL-2,\nSL-3 and SL-4. In addition to the three nominal Skylab missions, the\nprogram includes the Skylab Rescue Mission (SL-R). The SL-R mission is\ndesigned to provide a safe return of the Skylab crew in the event the\nCommand Service Module (CSM) becomes disabled while docked to the Saturn\nWorkshop (SWS). This volume contains mission requirements for the SL-R\nmission only. The Skylab SL-1/SL-2, SL-3 and SL-4 mission requirements\nare contained in Volumes I, II and III, respectively, of the Mission\nRequirements Document (MRD).\nSL-R mission configuration will be a CSM (modified with a field\ninstalled kit) manned by two crewmen launched on a Saturn IB Launch Vehicle.\nThe SL-R CSM will rendezvous and dock with the SWS (or Orbital Assembly [OA],\nconsisting of the SWS and disabled CSM, if the disabled CSM has not previously been jettisoned). The SWS configuration includes a Multiple Docking Adapter (MDA), Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM), Airlock Module (AM), and\nan S-IVB stage (modified as an Orbital Workshop [OWS]), previously launched\nand inserted into orbit on a two-stage Saturn V Launch Vehicle for the\nSL-1/SL-2 mission.\n1.2\n\nSCOPE AND PRECEDENCE\n\nThe MRD is prepared in accordance with NASA Headquarters, Office of\nManned Space Flight (OMSF), directives and Skylab specification documents\nas listed in NASA Headquarters Program Directive No. 43C, M-D ML3200.125,\ndated May 1, 1973 and Cluster Requirements Specification No. RS003M00003,\ndated August 8, 1969 (References 1 and 2, respectively). The MRD defines\nmission requirements and functional and performance requirements for\nimplementing the program and mission purposes specified therein. The\nscope of this MRD volume is the definition of mission operational requirements for the SL-R mission.\nThe MRD shall provide the basis for mission planning and design by all\nelements of the Skylab Program. In the event of conflict between the MRD\nand other mission planning documentation, the MRD shall govern with respect\nto mission objectives and requirements.\nThe relationship of the MRD with other program documentation is\ndepicted fn Figure 1-1, Skylab Mission Documentation. Performance\nand design requirements for cluster systems to implement mission requirements are contained in the Cluster Requirements Specification (Reference 2).\n\n1-1\n\nMany subsidiary mission documents must be prepared to implement the\nrequirements of this MRD. These documents may expand on, but must not\nconflict with the contents of the MRD.\n1.3 PUBLICATION AND REVISIONS\n1.3.1\n\nPublication\n\nDevelopment of the MRD is the joint responsibility of the Skylab\nProgram Offices at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and the Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC). Preparation and coordination of this document\nwill be performed under the cognizance of the Mission Requirements Panel\nwith approval and sign-off by both program managers.\n1.3.2 Revisions\nThe document will be revised as required to prpvide necessary guidelines for supporting activities. All revisions will be handled in the same\nmanner as the basic document and will require joint sign-off by the Skylab\nProgram managers at both the JSC and MSFC.\nRequests for changes to the document shall be submitted to either of\nthe Co-chairmen, Mission Requirements Subpanel (P.H. Allen, JSC/KM;\nR. A. Marmann, MSFC/SL-EI).\n1.3.3\n\nDistribution\n\nDistribution of this document is controlled by the Skylab Program\nOffices at JSC and MSFC.

The SL-R\nmission will utilize the next-in-line CSM and the corresponding Saturn IB\nLaunch Vehicle as the rescue vehicle for the SL-1/SL-2 or SL-3 crew. The\nbackup CSM and Saturn IB will be used as the rescue vehicle for the SL-4\ncrew.\nThe in-line and backup CSM/Launch Vehicle System shall continue in\na normal state of launch readiness preparations for the nominal mission\nuntil a decision is made to proceed with SL-R space vehicle preparation;\nthen, total systems preparations for launch readiness shall be conducted\naccording to an accelerated schedule. For the in-line mission vehicle,\nthe rescue field modification kit would be installed upon receipt of the\nrescue call; for the backup CSM (CSM 119)/Launch Vehicle (LV 209), the\nkit would be installed during the planned test and checkout flow. The\nSL-R CSM will be launched with two crewmen, rendezvous and dock with the\nSWS, retrieve the Skylab crew during the short duration docked period,\nand return safely to earth with five crewmen. The mission will terminate\nPrior to undocking and if cirwith recovery of the five Skylab crewmen.\ncumstances permit, the crew will configure the SWS for use on a subsequent\nmission.\n2.2\n\nMISSION PURPOSE\n\nThe purpose of the SL-R mission will be a safe return of the crew in\nthe event the CSM becomes disabled while docked to the SWS. Without compromising the above, planning should consider accomplishment of the following (relative priority is not implied in the order of listing):\na) Return selected experiment payload data\nb) Perform a diagnosis of the CSM failure\nc) Configure the SWS for revisit\n2.3\n\nMISSION REQUIREMENTS\n\n2.3.1\n2.3.1.1\n\nMission Profile Requirements\nLaunch Date\n\nThe CSM/Launch Vehicle (LV) system including CSM 119 and LV 209 shall\ncontinue in a normal state of launch readiness preparations for the nominal Skylab mission until a decision is made to proceed with preparation\nof the SL-R mission; then, modification of the CSM and total systems preparation for launch readiness shall be accelerated to the maximum extent\npractical. All necessary planning shall be accomplished to support implementation of the accelerated rescue preparations at any time after the\nnominal mission launch. The following times from rescue alert to rescue\nvehicle launch readiness shall be used for mission planning:\n\n2-1\n\n0\n\nDays to SL-R Ready to\nRescue Launch for\nSL-2\nSL-3*\nSL-4\n48 1/2\n48 1/2\n\n7\n\n41\n\nDays from SL\nMission Launched\n\n36 1/2\n31 1/2\n25\n---------\n\n14\n21\n28\n35\n44\n49\n56\n2.3.1.2\n\n41\n\n32\n25\n18\n9\n9\n9\n\n36\n31 1/2\n26\n19 1/2\n15\n15\n12 1/2\n\nLaunch Planning\n\nThe rescue vehicle launch opportunities will be planned to provide an\nearly (M = 5, 6 or 7) rendezvous capability and, if required, launch vehicle\nflight performance reserve (FPR) may be used for yaw steering and/or apogee\nheight (ha) adjustment.\n2.3.1.3 Launch Complex\nThe rescue vehicle will be launched from Complex 39B at Kennedy Space\nCenter (KSC).\n2.3.1.4 Insertion Altitudes\nThe SWS will have been previously inserted into a circular orbit of\napproximately 237 NM (measured above the mean equatorial reference radius)\nby a Saturn V Launch Vehicle.\nThe SL-R CSM will be nominally inserted into an 81- by 120 NIl orbit\n(measured above the mean equatorial reference radius) by a Saturn IB Launch\nVehicle, however, ha may be adjusted.\n2.3.1.5 Orbital Inclination\nMission planning shall be based on a northerly launch azimuth.\nThe rescue CSM will be targeted for rendezvous with the SWS orbiting\nat a planned orbital inclination of 50 degrees.\n2.3.1.6 Rendezvous and Docking\nSL-R mission planning shall provide the capability for two options with\nrespect to rendezvous and docking: 1) disabled CSM jettisoned and 2) disabled CSM retained. The selection of the appropriate option will be based\non the actual rescue situation.\n\n* Rescue launch readiness revised to reflect current planning as of\n8/16/73.\n2-2\n\n2.3.1.6.1\n\nDisabled CSM Jettisoned\n\na) Rendezvous\nThe rendezvous phase of the SL-R mission shall be similar to\nthe nominal Skylab mission rendezvous for docking at the MDA\naxial port.\nThe disabled CSM will be\nnoon with the SWS in the\nnote) attitude. For the\nsion of when to jettison\nsituation.\n\njettisoned within 30 degrees of orbital\nsolar inertial (X-IOP/Z) (see following\nactual SL-R mission, a real-time deciwill be made based on the specific\n\nb) Docking\nAxial docking of the CSM SL-R vehicle shall be performed in the\nX-IOP/Z attitude and in accordance with the nominal Skylab docking procedures and requirements.\nNOTE:\nX-IOP/Z: The solar inertial attitude is defined as the principal OA\nX axis in the orbital plane with the Z axis coincident with the sun line.\nThe -;Z axis points directly toward the sun and, at orbital noon, the +X\naxis is in the direction of the velocity vector. (The OA coordinate\nsystem is illustrated in Figure 2-1). The X-IOP/Z mode includes Control\nMoment Gyro (CMG) desaturation maneuvers performed each orbit on the\n"night" side of the orbit.\n2.3.1.6.2\na)\n\nDisabled CSM Retained\nRendezvous\nThe rendezvous phase of the SL-R mission shall be similar to the\nnominal Skylab mission rendezvous for docking at the MDA axial\nport.\n\nb) Docking\nFor docking at the radial port, the SWS Attitude and Pointing\nControl System (APCS) will be commanded to roll the OA 45 degrees\nclockwise (viewed in the OA +X axis direction) from the X-IOP/Z\nattitude beginning 10 minutes prior to orbit noon and lasting\napproximately 30 minutes. This roll position shall be maintained\nthrough completion of radial docking in order to provide the\nproper lighting for the rescue CSM; then, the APCS shall maneuver\nthe OA back to the X-IOP/Z attitude.

The maximum length of time the SL-R CSM may be docked to the MDA radial\nport shall be 40 hours.\n2.3.1.7 Orbital Attitudes\nThe attitude requirements for the Saturn Workshop are as follows:\na) Prior to CSM rendezvous - X-IOP/Z\nb) CSM rendezvous - X-IOP/Z\nc) CSM docking - X-IOP/Z (Refer to Section 2.3.1.6.2.b for exception)\nd) Docked operations - X-IOP/Z\ne) Inertial Measurement Unit alignment - X-IOP/Z\nf) CSM undocking - X-IOP/Z\ng) SWS stowage - X-IOP/Z\n2.3.1.8 Mission Duration\nTotal nominal mission duration shall be limited to five days from\nlaunch to splashdown.\n2.3.1.9 Recovery\nRecovery shall be similar to the nominal Skylab plan except for\nunique SL-R requirements due to the return of five crewmen and the\nuncertainty of the launch day affecting recovery area and lighting. All\nplanned landing areas shall be in water.\n2.3.2 Operations Requirements\n2.3.2.1 Extravehicular Activity\nAll extravehicular activity (EVA) periods shall be completed prior\nto arrival of the rescue CSM. EVA operations shall conform to the nominal\nSkylab mission EVA requirements.\n2.3.2.2 Rendezvous Lighting\nFlashing lights on the SWS shall be used during SL-R CSM rendezvous\nfor: (a) acquisition and tracking with the Command Module (CM) sextant\nto up-date the CSM state vector prior to rendezvous maneuvers; and (b)\ntracking with the Crewman Optical Alignment Sight (COAS). The lights\nshall provide continuous coverage through the sextant for a maximum range\nof 300 NM during darkness.\n\n2-6\n\n2.3.2.3\n\nCSM On-Orbit Operation\n\nThe rescue CSM shall remain powered up during the docked phase; in\nthe event the peak power loads required would result in low voltages, a\ndescent battery shall supplement the fuel cells.\nAt least one SL-R crewman shall sleep in the rescue CSM during the\ndocked phase if a sleep period is scheduled.\n2.3.2.4 Deorbit Capability\nThe SM Service Propulsion System (SPS) shall provide the primary\ndeorbit capability for the rescue CSM. The RCS shall provide a backup\ndeorbit capability.\n2.3.2.5 Orbital Assembly Attitude Control\nAttitude of the cluster during the docked phase shall be X-IOP/Z and\nattitude control may be maintained with larger than usual attitude deadbands and/or greater than usual propellant consumption permissible.\nThe APCS shall be the primary system for OA attitude control with a\nCSM docked to the axial port. OA attitude control shall be attempted with\nthe APCS with two CSM\'s docked (axial and radial ports) and with one CSM\ndocked to the radial port only; however, the rescue CSM Primary Guidance\nNavigation and Control System (PGNCS) shall be the primary control system\nin both of these modes.\n2.3.2.6 OA Internal Activities\nProvision shall be made for removal of ballast from the rescue CSM,\ntransfer to and stowage in the SWS prior to undocking.\nA backup downlink voice capability (assumed axial CSM communications\ninoperative) shall be provided for communications between MCC-H personnel\nand crew aboard the OA.\n2.3.2.7 ATM Film Retrieval and Stowage\nEVA for film retrieval shall be accomplished prior to arrival of the\nrescue CSM. Any retrieved ATM film stowed in the disabled CSM will be\nremoved prior to jettison of that CSM, and stowed in the SWS. Since only\nselected portions of this film will be returned by the rescue CSM (see\nSection 2.3.4), the remaining film will remain stowed in the SWS as\ncandidates for return on a subsequent mission.\n2.3.2.8 Budgeting of Electrical Power\nPlanning shall provide for operation of the rescue CSM fuel cells\nas outlined in Section 2.3.2.3. There shall be no CSM/SWS electrical\ninterface at the radial docking port.\n2.3.2.9 Mission Operational Guidelines\nThe following operational guidelines are provided for mission planning\npurposes and are in addition to guidelines provided in other sections of\nthis document:\na) Launch and in-flight rescue planning should minimize deviations\nfrom nominal mission planning.\nb) The axial docking port of the MDA will be the prime rescue port.\n2-7\n\nc) The radial docking port of the MDA will be the backup rescue\ndocking port in case the axial port is not usable.\nd) Every reasonable effort shall be made to gather data necessary\nto diagnose the CSM failure.\ne) The flight plan for the crew awaiting rescue will be modified\nto maximize experiment data available for return. Medical experiments, including those that require consumables, will continue at\nthe same intervals as during a nominal mission, if crew and\nvehicle conditions permit.\nf) Propellant Storage Module (PSM) propellants normally reserved\nfor deorbit will be used to complete an off-nominal rendezvous,\nif required, and provided the SPS is functioning satisfactorily.\ng) A disabled docked CSM inspection, if planned, will be performed\nfrom the rescue CSM prior to docking.\nh) CSM evaporator operation may be performed during docked operations, if required.\ni) SL-R mission planning shall preclude exceeding 4.0 g\'s during\na nominal entry.\nj) Pre-mission planning shall provide for a five crewman unsuited\nentry; the capability shall be retained for a five crewman\nsuited entry contingency situation.\nk) In the event the disabled CSM cannot be jettisoned, the VHF\nranging system shall remain enabled to allow possible acquisition at short ranges.\n1) Prior to jettison of the disabled CSM, the Flight Management\nTeam (FMT) will determine what operations and experiment hardware/\ndata onboard the disabled CSM will be transferred to the SWS for\nstowage. Consideration must be given to those data, etc., which\nwill be candidates for return on a subsequent mission.\n2.3.3 Mission Commit Policies and Requirements\nThe following policies and requirements are repeated verbatim from\nNASA Headquarters Program Directive 43C:\na) Criteria for initiating a rescue mission shall be included in\nthe Flight Mission Rules of each Skylab mission.\nb) The decision to proceed with preparation of the Rescue Mission\nspace vehicle will be made by the Program Director.\nc) The decision to initiate the Rescue Mission will be made by\nAssociate Administrator for Manned Space Flight.\n2.3.4 Experiment Data Stowage Guidelines\nStowage space designated specifically for the return of experiments\ndata will be provided in two volumes between the two lower couches of the\nrescue CSM. One volume, the urine specimen return container (which is\nnominal mission hardware launched aboard the OWS), will be returned at\n\n2-8\n\nthe location usually occupied by locker A8. The second volume, the SL-R\nexperiment return pallet (rescue kit unique hardware), will be launched\nand returned in the rescue CSM at the locations usually occupied by\nlockers A2 and A5. A maximum of 175 pounds of experiment related material\nwill be stowed within the 6.5 to 7.5 cubic feet volume of this pallet\n(approximately 16 inches wide, 48 inches long, and 18 inches high with a\nrounded top).\n2.3.4.1 Experiment Assignments\nExperiment assignments for the nominal missions are specified in the\nNASA Headquarters Program Directive and are contained in Volumes-I, II,\nand III of the MRD.\n2.3.4.2 Experiment Data Return Guidelines\nThe NASA Headquarters Program Directive 43C has defined guidelines\nfor experiment returns for a rescue mission, and the remainder of this\nsubsection (2.3.4.2) is repeated verbatim from that directive.\nThe following guidelines are to be used for advance planning and\nfor real-time experiment return selection. The guidelines are divided\ninto two categories; General and Specific. The general guidelines present\nthe approach to be used in the selection of experiment data. The specific\nguidelines present rules that affect specific experiment groups or specific\nexperiments. For the purpose of the guidelines, the experiment groups\nare considered to be Medical, ATM, EREP, and Corollary. The Specific\nGuidelines are considered to be the baseline experiment return package\nbased on nominal experiment accomplishment. The specific rules will be\nupdated after each mission to reflect actual mission accomplishments.\nIn the event of a rescue mission, the Program Director may alter the\nbaseline Specific Guidelines to meet the actual mission and experiment\nsituations. The Program Director will review and approve the experiment\ndata return package.\n2.3.4.2.1 General Guidelines\na) Reductions from nominal return affects all experiments.\nb) Select data to maximize scientific return with each experiment\ngroup rather than maximizing return of single experiments.\nc) Selection of data will consider:\nQuantity and quality of data on previous missions; quality of\ndata on the present mission; data return of the present mission\nby alternate means (telemetry, voice, TV); expected return on\nany subsequent missions.\nd) Experiment data that is not selected for return on a rescue\nmission will be considered for return on any subsequent missions.\n2.3.4.2.2 Specific Guidelines\nGuidelines apply to all missions unless otherwise noted.\na) Medical\n1) Select data to maximize information of the status of the\ncrew\'s health and well being.\n\n2-9\n\nA nominal weight of 127 Ibs. is allowable for urine chiller\nand contents. The urine chiller will not be returned on a\nSL-4 rescue if an alternate data return package has a\ngreater scientific return.\n3) Up to a nominal weight of 50 Ibs. of other medical data will\nbe returned. This will be reduced to 40 lbs. on SL-4.\n4) If unable to return ATM film, the 50 and 40 lb. limits above\nwill be increased by 15 lbs.\nb) ATM - Up to a nominal weight of 65 lbs. of ATM film will be\nreturned.\n2)\n\nc) EREP\n1) A nominal weight of 40 lbs. of EREP film and tape shall be\nreturned. On SL-4 this limit is raised by 10 lbs.\nIf unable to return ATM film, then an additional 15 lbs. of\nEREP film and tape will be returned.\nd) Corollary and Student\n1) Corollary and Student Experiment Data will use weight and\nvolume not occupied by the Medical, ATM, and EREP experiment\ngroups.\n2) Data will be selected to maximize the number of experiments\ntaken in descending order of FSP.\n3) On applicable missions, if unable to return ATM data, S020 data\nshall be returned.\n2.3.4.3 Rescue of the SL-l/SL-2 Crew\nThis subsection baselines two experiment data return packages using\nthe above defined guidelines. The content of the two packages will be\na function of the availability of ATM film for return. Mission planning\nfor rescue of SL-I/SL-2 shall account for both of these packages. The\nactual rescue return, should SL-R occur, will be developed as a delta\nto either of these two packages, as necessary, and shall be approved by\nthe FMT.\n2.3.4.3.1 Experiment Group Data Return Weight Budgets\nThe following table summarizes the nominal allowable return weights\nfor each experiment group as defined above:\nExperiment\nGroup\nMedical\n\nNominal Return Weight\n(Pounds)\nW/ATM\nW/O ATM\n\nData\nUrine Container and\nContents\n\nReturn\nStowage\nLocation\n\n127\n\nOther\nATM\nEREP\nCorollary/\n\n127\n50\n\n65\n\nPallet\n\nFilm\nFilm, Tape\nVarious\n\n65\n40\n20\n\n0\n55\n55\n\nPallet\nPallet\nPallet\n\n175\n\n175\n\nStudent\n\nTOTAL (Pallet)\n2-10\n\nA8\n\nAssumptions and Restrictions\nThe following assumptions and restrictions are subject to verification by subsequent studies and real-time conditions:\na) Data return on the pallet is weight limited rather than volume\nlimited.\nb) Data return in the urine container will be limited to that\nequivalent to a nominal 56-day mission.\nc) Selection of return data has not considered special orientation\nrequirements.\nd) No allowance has been made for packing aids other than specified\nnormal experiment return containers. Special packing aids\n(cushions, straps, etc.), if required will subtract from the data\nreturn herein specified as applicable to each experiment group.\ne) All experiments will be considered completed to the nominal\nmission baseline requirement. However, feces, vomitus, and\nurine will be selected in real-time from all such material\ngenerated throughout the mission until arrival of the rescue\nCSM. Experiment M110 blood sampling will be rescheduled to\napproximate a 56-day mission, except that the fixed blood samples\nwill be processed as close to SL-R launch as possible. A maximum\nof nine fixed blood samples may be returned (six for a nominal\nSL-1/SL-2 mission, plus three more drawn close to SL-R launch).\nf) Crew logs with the experiment data entries will be returned.\nExperiment weight allocation for these data, if stowed on the\nSL-R experiment return pallet, will be a real-time function.\ng) The medical experiment data listed as follows does not include\nurine collection and transfer assemblies (UCTA), contingency\nurine and fecal collection in the rescue CSM from the rescued\ncrew, or radiation dosimeters (not those of D008) since these are\noperational items returned whether or not any other experiment\ndata are returned.\n2.3.4.3.2\n\n2.3.4.3.3 Experiment Group Data Return\nThe following narrative is summarized in Table 2-1.\na) Medical data will be returned as follows:\n1) Urine Specimen Return Container - The weight of the urine\nreturn container and contents will be a real-time function\nof the duration of the wait period prior to the arrival of\nthe rescue CSM. The container has a 56-day capacity which\nrepresents a total weight of 127.4 pounds (maximum container and contents). Contents will include frozen urine\nfor Experiments M071 and M073, and frozen blood for Experiment\nM110. If the requirement for a rescue mission occurs such\nthat the expected total crew time in orbit will approach or\nexceed 56 days (i.e., the capacity of the urine specimen return container), special selection of urine samples for\nambient return will be required. The, urine samples frozen prior\nto identification of the requirements for the SL-R mission will\n2-11\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nSL-l/SL-2 Experiment Data Return\nWt. **\n\nExperiment\nGroup\n\nNo.*\n\n(Ib)\n\nItem(s) Candidate for Return\n\nReturn Status\nW/ATM\n\nW/O ATM\n\nM071\nM073\n\nUrine specimen return container with\ncontents of frozen urine and blood\n\n127.4\n(Max)\n\nX\n\nX\n\nM071\n\nFecal and vomitus bundles and return\ncontainers\n1 - 16-mm 400-ft film cassette\nOtolith goggles and return container\n\nNote 1\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1.2\n.9\n1.1\n.6\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n<<0.1\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1.2\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n50\n\n65\n\nM131\no\n\nM133\n20.16\nNote 2\n\nMagnetic tape, reels and container\nPotable water sample\nContents of IMSS\nM110 whole blood (9 samples max)\n20.10 microbiology swabs (42 swabs)\n20.10 air sampler petri dishes (6 each)\nIllness microbiology samples (16 swabs max)\nTOTAL GROUP RETURN WEIGHT (LB)\n\n(NOTE 3)\n\n.3\n.4 (max)\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nSL-1/SL-2 Experiment Data Return (Continued)\nWt.**\n\nExperiment\n\nGroup\n\nNo.*\nS052\nS054\n5056\nS\nHal\n\nItem(s) Candidate for Return\nCamera assembly and return container\nCassette and return container\nMagazine and return container\nFilm magazine and return container\n\n13\nS190B\nw\nw\n\nS191\n\nS190A\nS191\nS192\nS193\n\n1 set of 6 film cassettes and 2 film\ncontainers\n2 sets of 6 film cassettes and 4 film\ncontainers\n2 ETC film canister assemblies and 2 film\ncanister bags\n1 VTS 16-mm 140-ft film magazine and 1\nfilm container\n2 VTS 16-mm 140-ft film magazines and 1\nfilm container\n2 ESE reels magnetic tape, 2 flange\nsupport bands, and 2 tape handling\ncontainer assemblies\n\nW/O ATM\n\n(Ib)\n\nW/ATM\n\n17.65\n14.40\n14.45\n\nX\nX\nX\n\n15.75\n\nX\n\n-\n\n62.25\n\n0\n\n11.9\n\nX\n\n-\n\n23.8\n\n-\n\nX\n\n5.2\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1.2\n\nX\n\nTOTAL GROUP RETURN WEIGHT (LB)\nS190A\n\nReturn Status\n\nX\n\n2.2\n22.2\n\nX\n\nX\n\n40.5\n\n53.4\n\nS194\n\nTOTAL GROUP RETURN WEIGHT (LB)\n\nTable 2-1.\nExperiment\nGroup\nNo. *\n\nSL-1/SL-2 Experiment Data Return (Continued)\n\nItem(s) Candidate for Return\n\nS019\n\nFilm canister with film, front cover, and\nreturn container\n\nS183\n\nFilm carousel and return container\n1 - 16-mm 400-ft film cassette\n\nNote 4\nT003\n\nFilter assembly, log cards, clip, and\nreturn container\n1 - 16-mm 140-ft film magazine\n\nS\n\nT027/\nS073\nT025\n\ni\n\nS020\n\nV\n\nC\n\nD008\nM555\nM551\nM553\n\n1 - 35-mm film cassette and cassette\ncontainer\nFilm magazine, filter, and container\n5 passive dosimeters (removed from SL-2 CM)\nCrystal growth package and container\nStainless steel specimen and 1 - 16-mm\n400-ft film cassette (Note 5)\n1 cup with 14 spheres (1 specimen wheel)\nand container (Note 5)\n\nWt.\n(Ib)\n\nReturn Status\nW/ATM\nW/O ATM\n\n14.9\n\nX\n\nX\n\n7.3\n\nX\n\nX\n\n1.2\n\n-\n\nX\n\n-\n\nX\n\n.4\n\nX\n\n1.0\n-\n\nX\n\n1.8\n9.3\n\n-\n\nX\nX\n\n3.0\n\n-\n\nX\n\n-\n\nX\n\n.3\n9.0\n\n.4\n\nX\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nSL-1/SL-2 Experiment Data Return (Continued)\nWt. **\n\nExperiment\nNo.*\n\nGroup\n\nItem(s) Candidate for Return\n\n(lb)\n\nReturn Status\nW/ATM\n\nW/O ATM\n\nED11\n\nN/A\n\nX\n\nX\n\nED12\n\nData from EREP\n\nN/A\n\nX\n\nX\n\nED22\n\nData from S052\n\nN/A\n\nX\n\n-\n\nED23\nED26\n\nData from S019\nData from S019\n\nN/A\nN/A\n\nX\nX\n\nX\nX\n\nED31\n\nI7\n\nData from EREP\n\n1 - 35-mm film cassette and\ncassette container\n15 Petri dishes\n\n-\n\nX\n\n1.8\n\n4 detectors and return container\n\n3.0\n\nED76\n>_\na\n\nNote 6\n\nS35-mm\n\n16-mm 400-ft film cassette 1.2 lb\n16-mm 140-ft film magazine 1.0 lb\nfilm cassette and cassette\ncontainer .3 lb\nTOTAL GROUP RETURN WEIGHT (LB)\n\nTOTAL PALLET RETURN WEIGHT ALL GROUPS (LB)\n\n.3\n\nNote 6\n\nX\n-\n\nX\n\n-\n\nX\n\n22.2\n\n56.6\n\n175.0\n\n175.0\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nSL-1/SL-2 Experiment Data Return (Continued)\n\n* Corollary and student experiments are arranged in descending order by FSP.\n** Weight data derived from Reference 3.\nNOTES:\n1. Weight of feces and vomitus will be that necessary to bring the "Other" medical data up to\n50 lb, or 65 pounds when ATM film not available, after inclusion of M131, M133, 20.16, and\ncontents of the IMSS (see Note 2).\n2. Data contents of IMSS returned. Medical data and respective weights are as shown. The\nmaximums apply to a 56-day duration, but may be increased if this time is exceeded. The\nED31 petri dishes normally returned in the IMSS are returned as "Corollary and Student" data.\n3. Medical group weights shown are for data stowed on the SL-R experiment return pallet. The\nM071 and M073 frozen urine, and the M11O frozen blood are stowed at a separate location and\naccount for an additional 127.4 lb (maximum) of medical data.\n4. Film data for M487, M151 and M516.\n5. M551 and M553 share a 400-ft allocation of film (not necessarily the same cassette). Film\ndata returned should document the processing of the M551 stainless steel specimen. Film\ndata for M553, if not on this same cassette, should be given first consideration for return\nof those items identified in Note 6 when ATM film not returned.\n6. Any combination of the 3 types film shown may be returned in the total amount of 2.9 lb\nif ATM film not returned. Selection will be a real-time decision. (See Note 5 above\nwith respect to M553 film data.) M509, if performed on SL-I/SL-2, should be given\nconsideration for film return after inclusion of T025 data.\n\nnot be modified or efforts made to remove them from the\nfrozen stowage trays. After identification of SL-R requirements, urine samples from every third day during approximately\nmidmission may be stowed in the OWS at ambient temperature.\nM11O requirements preclude omitting or reducing the volume\nof urine samples on the day before, day of, or the day after\nblood sampling. These ambient temperature urine samples will\nbe returned in the rescue CSM, but not stowed in the volume\nof the urine specimen return container.\n2) Other Medical Data - The remainder of medical experiments\ndata will be limited to 50 pounds, or 65 pounds should the\nATM film be not available for return. These data will\ninclude the following:\na) The data contents of the In-Flight Medical Support System\n(IMSS) will be returned. These data will include the\nM11O whole blood samples (up to nine for a 56-day stay),\nthe 20.10 microbiology swabs (42 each) and air sampler\npetri dishes (six each), the ED31 petri dishes (15 each),\nand in the event of a crew illness, a maximum of 16\neach swabs (illness microbiology samples) contained in\ntransport vials. All of these data will be returned as\nmedical data except the ED31 petri dishes, which will\nbe returned as corollary and student data, and then only\nif ATM film data are not available for return.\nb) M131 otolith goggles, goggles container, and one 16-mm\n400-foot film cassette. Since this film is of a nondesignated classification, and data for experiments\nM487, M151, M516, M551, or M553 could also be recorded\nthereon, a real-time decision will be required as to the\nexperiment group accountability of this film cassette\n(See Note 6 of Table 2-1). That amount not accountable\nto M131 can be added to return of fecal/vomitus to the\nextent it (non M131 data) is deleted from the corollary\ngroup.\nc) M133 magnetic tape, reels and container.\nd) Potable water sample (8 ounces in container) for\nOperational DTO 20.16.\ne) MO71 fecal and vomitus bundles as required to fill the\n50 pounds (or 65 pounds as applicable) budget after\ninclusion of (a), (b), (c), and (d) above. Real-time\nselection of data will be required. Reduction of\nreturned fecal vomitus material to meet the weight\nrestraints of Table 2-1 will be accomplished by deleting\nsamples near midmission. Samples should be deleted in\nsequence, up to a maximum of six sequential samples from\neach crewmember. This sequential deletion may be\nrepeated as required after an interval of seven days of\ndata taking.\n\n2-17\n\nb) ATM data to be returned will be subject to real-time evaluation\nand selection, but will consist of one of the following options:\n1) S052 camera assembly and return container - 17.65 pounds\nS054 cassette and return container - 14.40 pounds\nS056 magazine assembly and return container - 14.45 pounds\nHal film magazine and return container - 15.75 pounds\n2) S082A magazine assembly and return canister - 58 pounds\n3) S082B magazine assembly and return canister - 60 pounds\nThe baseline package shall contain the first option above which\ntotals 62.25 pounds.\nc) EREP data as follows will be returned and will total 40.5 pounds,\nor 53.4 pounds should ATM film be not available for return. A\nreal-time evaluation and selection will be required to determine\nwhich specific sets of film and Experiment Support Equipment\n(ESE) magnetic tapes produce the most compatible EREP data\nreturn.\n1) One set of six S190A film cassettes and 2 film containers 11.9 pounds. Should ATM film be not available for return,\nan additional set of film cassettes and 2 more containers\nwill be returned - 23.8 pounds.\n2) Regardless of ATM film return status, return two S190B\nEarth Terrain Camera (ETC) film canister assemblies each\ncontained in a film canister bag - 5.2 pounds.\n3) One 16-mm 140-foot film magazine and one film container for\nthe S191 Viewfinder Tracking System (VTS) - 1.2 pounds,\nor two VTS film magazines and one film container - 2.2\npounds - should ATM film be not available for return.\n4) Regardless of ATM film return status, return two reels of\nESE magnetic tape, each in an ESE tape handling container\nassembly and with a flange support band - 22.2 pounds.\nd) Corollary and student data will make up the remainder of the\nweight allocation on the SL-R experiment stowage pallet. If the\ndata outlined above are returned, 22.25 pounds, or 56.6 pounds\nwith no ATM film, of corollary and student experiment data may\nbe returned. As previously noted, data are returned in descending order of FSP with consideration given to maximize the number\nof experiments for which data are returned as opposed to maximizing data for any particular experiment. Because of data or\nreturn container packaging, 100 percent of the nominal mission\ndata are returned for the following:\nWhen ATM film returned - SO19, ED22, ED23, ED26\nWhen ATM film not available for return - SO19, T003, S020,.\nM555, ED23, ED26, ED76\n\n2-18\n\nRegardless of ATM film return status, no return payload data\nwill be returned for the following experiments, primarily because\nof their return weight with respect to FSP: D024, S015 (installed\nin the SL-2 CM), S009, TO27(SA), and M552.\nRefer to Table 2-1 for return data for corollary and student\n2.3.4.4\n\nexperiments.\nRescue of the SL-3 Crew\n\nThis subsection baselines two experiment data return packages using\nthe above defined guidelines. The content of the two packages will be\na function of the availability of ATM film for return. Mission planning\nfor rescue of SL-3 shall account for both of these packages. THE ACTUAL\nRESCUE RETURN, SHOULD SL-R OCCUR, WILL BE DEVELOPED AS A DELTA TO EITHER\nOF THESE TWO PACKAGES, AS NECESSARY, AND SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE FMT.\nExperiment Group Data Return Weight Budgets\nThe following table sunmmarizes the nominal allowable return weights\nfor each experiment group as defined above:\nReturn\nNominal Return Weight\nStowage\n(Pounds)\nExperiment\nLocation\nW/O ATM\nW/ATM\nData\nGroup\n2.3.4.4.1\n\n127\n\n127\n\nA8\n\nOther\n\n50\n\n65\n\nPallet\n\nATM\n\nFilm\n\n65\n\n0\n\nPallet\n\nEREP\n\nFilm, Tape\n\n40\n\n55\n\nPallet\n\nCorollary/\nStudent\n\nVarious\n\n20\n\n55\n\nPallet\n\n175\n\n175\n\nUrine Container and\nContents\n\nMedical\n\nTOTAL (Pallet)\n2.3.4.4.2\n\nAssumptions and Restrictions\n\nThe following assumptions and restrictions are subject to verification by subsequent studies and real-time conditions:\na) Based on the 175 pound limit as defined in PD43, data return on\nthe pallet is weight limited rather than volume limited. The\nexperiment rescue return identified herein is designed to this\nweight limit. ANY ADDITIONAL STOWAGE RETURN CAPABILITY WILL BE\nFILLED BY JOINT LEVEL I/LEVEL II CONFIGURATION CONTROL BOARD AND/\nOR FMT ACTION.\nb)\n\nData return in the urine container will be limited to that\nequivalent to a nominal 56-day mission.\n\nc)\n\nSelection of return data has not considered special orientation\nrequirements.\nNo allowance has been made for packing aids and experiment return\ncontainers other than those identified herein. Other packing\naids (containers, wraps, cushions, straps, etc.), if required,\nwill subtract from the data return herein specified as applicable\nto each experiment group.\n2-19\n\nd)\n\nAll experiments will be considered completed to the nominal\nmission baseline requirement. However, feces, vomitus, and\nurine will be selected in real-time from all such material generated throughout the mission until arrival of the rescue CM.\nf) Crew logs with the experiment data entries will be returned.\nExperiment weight allocation for these data, if stowed on the\nSL-R experiment return pallet, will be a real-time function.\ng) The medical experiment data listed as follows does not include\nurine collection and transfer assemblies (UCTA), contingency\nurine and fecal collection in the rescue CSM from the rescued\ncrew, or radiation dosimeters since these are operational items\nreturned whether or not any other experiment data are returned.\n2.3.4.4.3 Experiment Group Data Return\ne)\n\nThe data returns identified in the following narrative are summarized\nin Table 2-2, and are based on the 175 pound limit per PD43Co\na) Medical data for return on an SL-R mission will require real-time\nselection of urine, feces, vomitus generated throughout the SL-3\ncrew on-orbit time. Special requirements may be necessary for\nM110 blood sampling, processing and stowage.\nIf the requirement for a rescue mission occurs such that the\nexpected total crew time in orbit will approach or exceed that\nfor a nominal mission (i.e., the capacity of the urine specimen\nreturn container may be exceeded), additional urine half-samples\n(62-ml) will be scheduled to allow at least a half-sample of\nurine from each crewman each day. The urine samples frozen prior\nto identification of the requirements for the SL-R mission will\nnot be modified or attempts made to remove them from the sample\ntrays. Should the requirement for a rescue mission occur so\nlate that the requirement for a urine sample from each crewman\neach day cannot be met by stowing half-samples in the urine specimen return container, special selection of urine samples for\nambient return will be required. These urine samples will be\nfrozen and stowed in the OWS food freezer. An attempt will be\nmade to return these samples in a frozen state in the rescue CM.\nReturn stowage will not be in the urine specimen return container,\nand is not necessarily restricted to the SL-R experiment return\npallet.\nExperiment M110 blood sampling will continue to schedule toward\nthe baseline SL-3 requirements, except that the fixed blood\nsample will be processed as close to SL-R launch as possible.\nShould the SL-R launch after completion of the nominal M110\nmission requirements (approximately mission day [MD] 58), an\nadditional blood sample for each crewman will be drawn and processed at approximately the time of SL-R launch. Therefore, a\nmaximum of nine fixed blood samples may be returned (six for a\nnominal SL-3 mission plus three more drawn close to SL-R launch\n\n2-20\n\nTable 2-2.\n\nSL-3 Experiment Data Return\nSL-R

investi-\n\nNOTES:\n1. Weight of feces and vomitus will be that necessary to bring the "Other"\nmedical data up to 50 Ib, or 65 lb when ATM film not available,\nafter inclusion of all other medical data returned on the SL-R experiment\nreturn pallet.\n2. M131 is allocated 400-feet of S0168 16-mm film which weighs 1.2 pounds.\nSelected portions of these data will be returned and chargeable to M131.\n(See NOTE 7).\n3. The otolith goggles and return container will be returned (with or\nwithout ATM film data) only if it is known that the SL-4 mission will\nnot be performed.\n4. The data contents of the IMSS and required packing aids will weigh a\nmaximum of approximately 4.0 lb.\n5. Miscellaneous data may include three M11O automatic sample processors\nremoved from the urine specimen return container when three additional\nblood samples are drawn after completion of the nominal M110 baseline\nrequirements, and also urine samples not stowed in the urine specimen\nreturn container. These data will not necessarily be stowed on the\nexperiment return pallet.\n6. Medical group weights shown are for data stowed on the SL-R experiment\nreturn pallet. The MO71 and M073 frozen urine and the M110 frozen\nblood stowed in the urine specimen return container account for an\nadditional 127.4 lb (maximum) of medical data.\n7. These experiments, plus M131 and operations/housekeeping, use 16-mm\nnon-dedicated film cassettes, which results in various data on any one\ncassette. Assuming one cassette is returned for M131, the FMT will\nselect two cassettes, or 26 cassettes should ATM film be not available,\nfor return.\n8. Both sets will be returned in locker B6.\n9. 0024 requires an EVA for data retrieval. It is assumed that if EVA\ncannot be performed for ATM film retrieval, then EVA also cannot be\nperformed for 0024.\n10.\n11.\n\nS230 data will be returned in locker U4.\nDedicated film within the primary S019 film canister.\n\n12.\n\nThe FMT will select up to two cassettes containing ED32 and ED52 data\nfor return.\n\n13.\n\nED63 and ED74 share a 400-ft allocation of S0168 16-mm film.\nNOTE 7 for return criteria.\nWeights shown do not include S149 and S230.\n\n14.\n\n2-27\n\nSee\n\nwhen same occurs after MD58. The remaining blood from these\nfinal blood samples will be frozen after separation of the plasma\nand cellular phases, and placed in the urine specimen return\ncontainer for return. Three previously processed frozen blood\nsamples will be removed from the urine specimen return container\nto allow this replacement. An attempt will be made to return\nthese displaced samples in a frozen state.\nMedical data will be returned as follows:\n1) Urine Specimen Return Container - The weight of the urine\nreturn container and contents will be a real-time function\nof the duration of the wait period prior to the arrival of\nthe rescue CSM. The container has a nominal 56-day capacity\nwhich represents a total weight of 127.4 pounds (maximum container and contents). Contents will include frozen urine\nfor Experiments M071 and M073, and frozen blood for Experiment\nM110. Not included are those selected urione samples processed\nand frozen after the urine specimen return container has been\nfilled to its nominal capacity.\n2) Other Medical Data - The remainder of medical experiments\ndata will be limited to 50 pounds, or 65 pounds should the\nATM film be not available for return. These data will include\nthe following:\na) The data contents of the In-Flight Medical Support System\n(IMSS) will be returned. These data will include the\n20.10 microbiology swabs (42 each) and air sampler petri\ndishes (four each), a maximum of eight swabs (illness\nmicrobiology samples taken in the event of a crew illness),\nand M110 fixed whole blood samples (up to nine). Packing\naids (approximately two pounds) will be required\'to preserve the data.\nb) The M131 otolith goggles and goggles return container\nwill be returned if it is known that the SL-4 mission\nwill not be performed, or that M131 will not be conducted\non SL-4. Photographic data will also be returned for\nM131. Since M131 film is of a non-designated classification, and data for experiments M151, M487, M509, M516,\nTO13, TO20, ED52, ED63, and ED74 could be intermixed with\nM131 data, a real-time decision will be required as to\nthe experiment group accountability of the film cassette(s)\ncontaining M131 data. That amount not accountable to\nM131 can be added to the return of other medical data to\nthe extent it (non M131 data) is deleted from the corollary\ngroup. See discussion on this type film in the corollary\ngroup.\nc) Two reels of M133 magnetic tape and the M133 return\ncontainer will be returned.\nd) The potable water sample (8 ounces in container) for\nOperational DTO 20.16 will be returned.\n\n2-28\n\ne) The selected blood and urine which could not be stowed\nin the urine specimen return container will be returned.\nAs previously stated, an attempt will be made to return\nthese samples in a frozen state.\nf)\n\nIf access to the cabin of the disabled SL-3 CM is\npossible, a crewman will disassemble the SO15 experiment\npackage and retrieve the S015 growth curve module (GCM)\nsubsystem and the film module for SL-R return.\n\ng) One M092 leg band will be returned.\nh) During the mission, certain food items may be found to\nbe spoiled or otherwise not palatable. Up to eight of\nthese items, approximately 1.7 pounds total, will be\nselected for return.\ni) Based on the SL-2 mission, approximately 99 M071 fecal/\nvomitus samples are expected to be available for nominal\nSL-3 return. These samples have an average weight of\napproximately 0.3 pound each. Fecal/vomitus samples,\nand return containers as may be deemed necessary, will be\nreturned to the extent that the total medical data on the\nSL-R experiment return pallet (after first, including\nitems a through h above) does not exceed 50 pounds, or\n65 pounds when ATM film data are not available for return.\nReduction of returned fecal/vomitus material to meet\nthese weight restrictions, if necessary, will be accomplished by deleting early mission samples.\nb)\n\nSixty-five pounds of ATM data may be returned. Subject to realtime evaluation and selection, the following options are available:\n1)\n\nS052 camera assembly and cover assembly\nS054 cassette, return container, and shutter override actuator\nS056 magazine assembly and return container\nHal film magazine and return container\n\n2)\n\nSO082A magazine assembly and return canister\n\nS082B magazine assembly and return canister\nThe baseline package shall contain the first option above which\ntotals 62.5 pounds.\n3)\n\nc) EREP data as follows will be returned and will total 40.4 pounds,\n,or 55.3 pounds should ATM film be not available for return. A\nreal-time evaluation and selection will be required to determine\nwhich specific film and Experiment Support Equipment (ESE) magnetic tapes produce the most compatible EREP data return.\n1) Six S190A film cassettes and 2 film containers. Should ATM\nfilm be not available for return, eight film cassettes and\n3 containers will be returned.\n2) Regardless of ATM film return status, return two S190B Earth\nTerrain Camera (ETC) film canister assemblies each contained\nin a film canister bag.\n2-29\n\n3) Regardless of ATM film return status, return one 16-mm 140foot film magazine for the S191 Viewfinder Tracker System\n(VTS).\n4) Two reels of ESE magnetic tape, each in an ESE tape handling\ncontainer assembly and with a flange support band. Should\nATM film be not available for return, three reels of ESE tape,\netc., will be returned.\nd) Corollary and student data will make up the remainder of the\nweight allocation on the SL-R experiment stowage pallet. If the\ndata outlined above are returned, up to 22.1 pounds, or 54.7\npounds with no ATM film, of corollary and student experiment data\nmay be returned. As previously noted, data are returned in\ndescending order of FSP with consideration given to maximize the\nnumber of experiments for which data are returned as opposed to\nmaximizing data for any particular experiment.\nRegardless of ATM film status, no return payload data will be\nreturned for 0024. When ATM film are available, the return weight\nand/or FSP preclude return of this experiment package. It is\nassumed that since this experiment requires EVA for data retrieval,\nit will not be retrieved if ATM cannot be retrieved.\nReturn for S015 is discussed under medical data.\nThe following corollary and student data will be returned:\n1) One S019 film canister and front cover.\n2) One S183 16-mm 140-foot film magazine.\n3) TO003 filter assembly, log cards, clip and return\ncontainer.\n4) Two sets of four S149 cassettes, and two containers, will\nbe stowed in locker B6 for return. Should the last SL-3\nEVA not be performed, only one set (and container) will\nbe available for return. If locker B6 is not available\nthen one S149 set and container will be returned on the\nSL-R experiment return pallet only when ATM data are not\nreturned. This addition to pallet stowage would require\nredefinition of the corollary experiments return data.\n5) One S228 detector module.\n6) Two S063 35-mm film cassettes and two containers.\n7) The S230 stowage pouch containing three collector\nassemblies will be stowed in locker U4 for return. Should\nthe last SL-3 EVA not be performed, only two collector\nassemblies will be available for return in the pouch\n(these collectors were retrieved on the first SL-3 EVA).\nIf locker U4 is not available, the S230 data available\nwill be returned on the SL-R experiment return pallet.\n\n2-30\n\n8) Experiments MI31, M151, M487, M509, M516, TO013, TO20,\nstudent investigations ED52, ED63, ED74, and operations/\nhousekeeping all use non-dedicated type S0168 16-mm 400See medical data for discussion on film\nfoot cassettes.\nSince film operations protocol (Reference 5)\nfor M131.\ndoes not restrict usage of any one cassette to any one\nexperiment/investigation/operation, documentation for\nseveral activities may be recorded on any one cassette.\nOf the thirty cassettes of this type available for return\nand exclusive of M131 film return, two cassettes will be\nreturned when ATM data are returned, or 26 cassettes will\nbe returned when ATM data are not returned. Selection of\ncassettes to be returned will be a real-time function for\nthe FMT.\n9) Student investigations ED11 and ED12 are data duplications\nof EREP data, and ED21, ED22 and ED25 are data duplication\nof ATM data. Therefore, data return for these investigations will depend on the respective requirements of each\ninvestigation being attained by the respective EREP or\nATM group, and that the required data within EREP or ATM\nare part of the SL-R return payload.\n10)\n\nData for ED23 and ED26 are dedicated film contained within\nthe S019 film canister. It is assumed that these data\nwill be in the first S019 canister used, since all experiment baseline requirements must be satisfied prior to use\nof the second S019 canister, and that the first S019\ncanister will be returned.\n\n11)\n\nED32 and ED52 use non-dedicated 35-mm S0168 film cassettes\nand have been allocated a specific number of frames equivalent to approximately one 50-frame cassette. Data may\nbe intermixed with operations/housekeeping data. The FMT\nwill select up to two cassettes containing ED32 and ED52\ndata for return.\n\n12)\n\nThe ED52 carrying case assembly, containing two spider\ncontainer assemblies and one IMSS cotton swab wrapped\nwith a spider web, will be returned.\n\n13)\n\nWhen ATM film data are not available for return, the\nfollowing will be added to that previously identified:\na) Two TO20 16-mm 140-foot film magazines.\nb) The remaining four S063 35-mm cassettes and\ncontainers.\n\n2.3.4.5\n\nRescue of the SL-4 Crew\nTBD\n\n2-31\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
