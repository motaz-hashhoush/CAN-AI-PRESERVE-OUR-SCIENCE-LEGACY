Creech, Assistant Program Manager, Strategy and Partnerships\nSpace Launch System Program, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama, U.S.A.\nStephen.D.Creech@nasa.gov\nTodd A. May, Program Manager\nSpace Launch System Program, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama, U.S.A.\nTodd.May@nasa.gov\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA\xe2\x80\x99s) Space Launch System (SLS) Program, managed\nat the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), is making progress toward delivering a new capability for human\nspace flight and scientific missions beyond Earth orbit. Designed with the goals of safety, affordability, and sustainability in mind, the SLS rocket will launch the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), equipment, supplies,\nand major science missions for exploration and discovery. Supporting Orion\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous flight to lunar orbit\nand back in 2017 and its first crewed flight in 2021, the SLS will evolve into the most powerful launch vehicle ever\nflown via an upgrade approach that will provide building blocks for future space exploration. NASA is working to\ndeliver this new capability in an austere economic climate, a fact that has inspired the SLS team to find innovative\nsolutions to the challenges of designing, developing, fielding, and operating the largest rocket in history. This paper\nwill summarize the planned capabilities of the vehicle, the progress the SLS Program has made in the 2 years since\nthe Agency formally announced its architecture in September 2011, the path it is following to reach the launch pad\nin 2017 and then to evolve the 70 metric ton (t) initial lift capability to 130-t lift capability after 2021. The paper will\nexplain how, to meet the challenge of a flat funding curve, an architecture was chosen that combines the use and enhancement of legacy systems and technology with strategic new developments that will evolve the launch vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\ncapabilities. This approach reduces the time and cost of delivering the initial 70 t Block 1 vehicle, and reduces the\nnumber of parallel development investments required to deliver the evolved 130 t Block 2 vehicle. The paper will\noutline the milestones the program has already reached, from developmental milestones such as the manufacture of\nthe first flight hardware, to life-cycle milestones such as the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The paper\nwill also discuss the remaining challenges both in delivering the 70-t vehicle and in evolving its capabilities to the\n130-t vehicle, and how NASA plans to accomplish these goals. As this paper will explain, SLS is making measurable progress toward becoming a global infrastructure asset for robotic and human scouts of all nations by harnessing business and technological innovations to deliver sustainable solutions for space exploration.\nI. BACKGROUND\nWhen the Space Shuttle Atlantis made its final\nlanding at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in July\n2011, retiring that productive low-Earth orbit capability after 30 years of service, NASA was already\nplanning for a new launch vehicle to once again take\nhuman explorers beyond Earth orbit into deep space,\nwhile investing in private companies to help service\nthe International Space Station market opened by the\nShuttle and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s international partners (Fig. I).\n\nIAC-13,D2.1,10x19760\n\nThe NASA Authorization Act of 2010 laid out the\nrequirements for a powerful, versatile transportation\nsystem that could support a range of strategically important missions, such as the first Mars sample return\non the course to eventual human journeys to explore\nanother planet. NASA enlisted aerospace experts and\nstakeholders to participate in numerous studies that\nled to the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s selection of the SLS architecture\nin September 2011. Results of those trade studies\nare detailed in the \xe2\x80\x9cPreliminary Report Regarding\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch System and Multi-Purpose\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\nFig. I: SLS value proposition for deep-space missions.\nCrew Vehicle Pursuant to Section 309 of the NASA\nAuthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-267).\xe2\x80\x9d 1\nBased on requirements for a safe, affordable, and\nsustainable capability, the architecture selected is\nthe best choice from among hundreds of concepts\nanalyzed. A series of detailed trade studies was performed against numerous figures of merit with a common set of goals that included minimizing life-cycle\ncosts, enabling challenging missions to deep space,\nand maintaining critical skills and transitioning the\nworkforce effectively. From these concepts, three\nfamilies of vehicles were chosen for further analysis\nincluding: (1) a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/\nLH2) Shuttle-derived vehicle, (2) a liquid oxygen/hydrocarbon (LOX/RP-1) vehicle similar to the Saturn\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreliminary Report Regarding NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nSpace Launch System and Multi-Purpose\nCrew Vehicle Pursuant to Section 309 of the\nNASA Authorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111267), http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/510449main_\nSLS_MPCV_90-day_Report.pdf\n\nIAC-13,D2.1,10x19760\n\nV, and (3) a modular core vehicle utilizing commercially-available assets. In addition, NASA released a\nBroad Agency Announcement that sought technical\nsolutions to support heavy-lift system concepts and\narchitectures and to identify propulsion technology\ngaps to support NASA\xe2\x80\x99s goals.\nThe three vehicle concepts were presented during\nan Agency-led Mission Concept Review in March\n2011 (Fig. II), with senior manager Tom Gavin of\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory serving as the Chair\nof the independent Standing Review Board commissioned to assist in this important decision. Former\nSpace Shuttle flight director Leroy Cain followed Mr.\nGavin as the Chair of the Standing Review Board for\nthe SLS System Requirements Review and System\nDefinition Review in July 2012, and the PDR in July\n2013, as discussed below.\nIn parallel with these early studies, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Procurement Office assessed the vehicle concepts from a\nfiscal perspective. This included the design, development, testing, and evaluation (DDT&E) investments\nPage 2 of 10\n\nnew missions in the near term and will evolve to even\ngreater performance as resources permit (Fig. III).\nThe SLS rocket will be the first to send astronauts\nbeyond Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit since the Apollo Program in the\n1970s and supports a number of potential payloads.2\nFig. II: SLS milestone schedule.\nneeded, as well as the nonrecurring operations costs\nexpected. The Shuttle-derived design was found to\noffer the safest, most capable transportation system\nin the shortest amount of time for the anticipated\nnear-term and long-range budgets, and the SLS plan\nof action reflects this storied heritage.\nOver the last 2 years, the SLS team has matured\nthe launch vehicle from concept to design in only 21\nmonths. While operating within a constrained budget,\nthe Program has effectively managed resources and\nfinished each year with a positive balance sheet. The\nSLS Program\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive progress attests to\nthe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to provide a world-class\nlaunch vehicle that will take explorers and scientific\nspacecraft to deep space beginning later this decade.\nFollowing is a summary of the approach to delivering initial and evolved capabilities, along with brief\nhardware status reports.\nII.

Later,\nthe design will be evolved to 130 t (Fig. IV) to handle\nthe heavy lifting required for ambitious futuristic pursuits, as outlined in the NASA publication \xe2\x80\x9cVoyages:\nCharting the Course for Sustainable Human Space\nExploration\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Global Exploration Roadmap.\xe2\x80\x9d 3, 4\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGame Changing: NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch\nSystem Science Mission Design,\xe2\x80\x9d paper\npresented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2013, March 2013, http://ntrs.\nnasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.\ngov/20130013034_2013012810.pdf\n3\n\xe2\x80\x9cVoyages: Charting the Course for Sustainable Human Space Exploration,\xe2\x80\x9d June 2012,\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/exploration/whyweex\nplore/voyages-report.html#.UhZwPOBcTh4\n4\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Global Exploration Roadmap,\xe2\x80\x9d August\n2013, http://www.nasa.gov/content/just-re\nleased-updates-to-the-global-exploration\n-roadmap/#.UhZxR-BcTh4\n2\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\nFig. IV: SLS evolution path.\nFig. III: Artist\xe2\x80\x99s concept of SLS launching from the\nKennedy Space Center.\nBy using common design elements, the SLS\nconnections with the ground systems at KSC and\nwith the spacecraft and payloads it carries will remain\nconsistent over time, reducing complexity. The SLS\noperational scheme takes advantage of resources\nestablished for the Space Shuttle, including the\nworkforce, tooling, manufacturing processes, supply\nchains, transportation logistics, launch infrastructure,\nand LOX/LH2 propellants.\nWith hardware arriving at KSC for launch processing beginning in 2016, the SLS vehicle will be\nprepared for its maiden voyage slated for December\n2017 (Fig. V). The KSC launch complex is being\nreadied for SLS operations and the contract to modify\nthe mobile launch platform has been awarded.5 The\nfirst mission will launch Orion on an autonomous\nflight to the Moon and back. In 2021, SLS will launch\nOrion with a crew aboard on a mission beyond the\nMoon, farther in space than humans have ever gone\nbefore. Future missions will include destinations such\nas Mars.6\n\ntage of 16 Space Shuttle Main Engines\n(RS-25) in stock at the conclusion of the Space\nShuttle era, leveraging a proven asset and maximizing the significant value of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s inventory. The\nSLS architecture also includes two 5-segement solid\nrocket boosters (SRBs), which were in development\nfor the Constellation Program\xe2\x80\x99s Ares Project and are\nderivatives of the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s 4-segment SRBs.\nContinuing the contract already in place proved a\nsignificant cost avoidance and allowed a quick start to\nthe design of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful boosters. The\nInterim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) that will\npropel Orion to the far side of the Moon is a modified\nDelta IV Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS), leveraging a valuable asset from the U.S. evolved expendable launch vehicle fleet.\n\nThe most costly part of any rocket development is\nits propulsion systems.

The 8.4-meter (m) diameter stage\nis the same width as the Space Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s external tank,\ntaking advantage of the one-of-a-kind Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) manufacturing infrastructure.\nThe 70-t vehicle will have 10 percent more thrust\nthan the Saturn V at liftoff and the 130-t vehicle\nwill have 20 percent more thrust with the addition\nof as-yet-to-be-determined advanced boosters and a\ncryogenic propulsion stage. As the vehicle is evolved\nto greater lift and larger fairing sizes, from 8.4 m to\n10 m, the capacity that the SLS offers can reduce\nspacecraft design complexity. It can transport more\nequipment and cargo to distant destinations in less\ntime, further reducing cost and risk for potential\npayload providers.\nMeasurable progress has been made for both\nthe initial and evolved designs, with parallel trade\nstudies being conducted for future advanced boosters\nand low-level investments being made in promising\nresearch and development, such as additive manufacturing, so that decisions made for the 70-t vehicle\ndirectly support the evolvability path to Mars and\nbeyond.\n\nTaken together, the time and cost savings of each\nimprovement are significant.\nTangible progress has been made on every aspect\nof the rocket. The first SLS flight hardware, which is\nbeing built today, is the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle\n(MPCV) Stage Adapter (MSA), a structural ring (Fig.\nVI) that will mate an Orion test article to a Delta IV\nrocket for a high-Earth orbit test flight in 2014.7 Reflecting the SLS Program\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdesign once, build many\ntimes\xe2\x80\x9d affordability tenet, this same design will be\nused for full-up SLS missions, as well.\nFrom accomplishments across laboratories, manufacturing facilities, and test stands, to disciplined\nresource management in an austere budget climate,\nthe SLS Program is consistently meeting its commitments and steadily progressing toward delivery of a\nrocket for entirely new missions of global importance.\nThe various hardware elements converge under the\nauspices of the systems engineering and integration (SE&I) function, which manages vehicle-level\nrequirements and provides decomposed requirements\nto the elements; orchestrates myriad technical tasks to\na predetermined timeline; and creates a climate that\n\nIII. PROGRESS REPORT\nThe SLS initiative pushes the boundaries of\nnumerous clean-sheet developments that have come\nbefore. The SLS development schedule is planned to\nbe 7 years instead of the 10 years it took to develop\nthe Saturn V and Space Shuttle, primarily due to the\nuse of heritage hardware. The development cost is\nprojected to be a fraction of those programs and the\nvehicle is being designed to operate at much lower\ncosts, as well.\nThe programmatic aspects of schedule and budget\nare key variables in solving the technical issues that\nnormally occur when conducting an engineering\nfeat of this magnitude. Learning the lessons of their\nforbearers while adopting modern methods such\nas value stream mapping, the SLS team\xe2\x80\x99s advantage\nincludes everything from harnessing rich databases\ncreated over the last 5 decades, to applying judicious\nrisk-based insight/oversight of contractor work.\nIAC-13,D2.1,10x19760\n\nFig. VI: Stage adapter fit-check at Marshall Space\nFlight Center, June 2013.\n7\n\nAdapter Flips for Progress Toward 2014\nExploration Flight Test, May 22, 2013,\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/\nringflip.html\nPage 5 of 10\n\nembraces healthy change tempered with experience\nand anchored by firsthand knowledge of space transportation systems.\nSystems Engineering and Integration\nThe partnership between the programmatic and\nengineering functions ensures that the initial 70-t\nvehicle meets its performance requirements and is\ndelivered on time and within budget at an acceptable risk level. The partnership also works to ensure\nthat the evolved 130-t vehicle can be achieved with\nthe least amount of development work and minimal\nconfiguration changes (reference Figure IV). In this\narrangement, the SLS Program Manager is responsible for the programmatic baseline and the SLS Chief\nEngineer is responsible for the technical baseline. The\ntechnical baseline includes such aspects as the outer\nmold line and concept of operations, as well as factors\nsuch as mass properties, configuration-controlled\ndesign drawings, and so forth.\nTo that end, the SLS Chief Engineer manages the\nSE&I team, which is a lean organization comprising\nlead system engineers, discipline lead engineers, and a\nchief engineers network embedded within the vehicle\nelements (boosters, main engines, core stage/avionics,\nand spacecraft integration). SE&I personnel focus on\nthe technical interfaces \xe2\x80\x94 structural, electrical, and\norganizational \xe2\x80\x94 between the individually procured hardware elements discussed below. This team\nperforms vehicle-level analyses that are supported by\na range of tools and analysis methodologies, such as\nwind tunnel flights and scale-model acoustic testing,\namong others (Fig. VII). 8, 9\nThe SLS SE&I team began with requirements analysis cycles, which helped define the optimum architecture, and then matured to design analysis cycles to\ncalibrate the individual elements and determine that\nthe system will deliver the performance expected.

Using the classic systems engineering \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d, which represents validation on the downward\nslope and verification on the upward side, some of the\nactivities and associated products are serial in nature,\nwhile others progress simultaneously. Following the\nthird design analysis cycle, which is now in progress,\na verification analysis cycle will begin, using variables\nsuch as the results of trade studies at the vehicle and\nelement levels, modeling and simulation of mission\nscenarios, and a range of increasingly flight-like\ntesting to refine the architecture leading up to the SLS\nCritical Design Review (CDR) in 2015.\nWhile competitive opportunities have been made\navailable for affordability on-ramps as the vehicle is\nevolved, the initial SLS design makes maximum use\nof existing assets, infrastructure, and workforce \xe2\x80\x94 all\nfactors that contribute to affordability. As stated earlier, the extensive use of heritage hardware in the SLS\ndesign presents both opportunities and challenges.\nUsing existing contract mechanisms provided a quick\nstart and a specific scope of work. This approach\nmaintained forward progress during policy changes\nand budget refinements. It also reduces the technical,\ncost, and schedule risk inherent in new developments.\nWhile heritage hardware comes with well-known\ncharacteristics, it also brings with it challenges relative\nto using technology designed for a specific application being used in new environments. Some of these\nare covered in the element sections below, along\nwith sample solutions under consideration. The SLS\nChief Engineer conducted a technical panel on this\ntopic at the American Institute of Aeronautics and\nAstronautics 2013 Joint Propulsion Conference, and\nPage 6 of 10\n\nthe available technical literature covers many of the\ndecisions being made to integrate the vehicle in the\nmost optimum way.10,11\n5-Segment Solid Rocket Boosters\nThe 5-segment SRBs for the first two SLS flights\nare produced by Alliant Techsystems, Inc. (ATK) and\nwill be the most powerful in the world, delivering\n3.55 million pounds of thrust during the early boost\nphase of flight. Heritage hardware and design includes\nforward structures, metal cases, aft skirt, and thrust\nvector control. The upgraded hardware and expendable design includes the solid rocket motor, avionics,\nand asbestos-free insulation.\nAmong the challenges of applying heritage hardware to the new SLS configuration has been with\nthe forward separation bolt. This bolt is part of the\nsystem required to actively detach boosters from\nthe main vehicle upon completion of booster firing.\nTwo features will be improved. First, the bolt will be\nmade stronger to accommodate the higher loads on\nthe bolt as the booster thrust decreases and the core\ncontinues to accelerate. To handle this, the separation\nbolt groove will be shallower, which gives the bolt a\nlarger cross-sectional area and makes the bolt stronger. Exact depth of the groove will vary from each\n\nlot of bolt material and will not be determined until\nthe material properties from the lot of material have\nbeen determined. A second improvement will be to\nchange the tolerance band for the pressure cartridge.\nThe minimum charge allowed will be changed to help\nguarantee that the pyrotechnics in the cartridge will\nbe the right amount to break the stronger bolt.\nFollowing three successful developmental motor tests, the first qualification motor (QM-1) is\nnow being manufactured (Fig. VIII). Following the\nQM-1 test in 2014, the instrumented motor will be\ndisassembled and inspected prior to casting QM-2\nsegments. QM-2 testing is scheduled for 2015. Following disassembly, inspection, and analysis of QM-2,\ndecision gates will lead to booster fabrication for\nExploration Mission 1 (EM-1).12\nBooster avionics boxes control the stage, take\nmeasurements, and communicate with the vehicle\nusing an ignition separation controller, hydraulic\npower unit controller, booster control power distribution unit, and actuator control unit. Demonstration\ntests and flight control tests have been conducted to\nsupport QM-1 and -2 full-scale static tests.13 In addition to contractor facilities, an avionics hardware-inthe-loop facility at MSFC allows end-to-end control\nsystem testing under simulated load conditions for\ndevelopment and certification testing.\nIn 2012, the Booster Element Office conducted\nextensive value stream mapping processes, which\nhelped gain efficiencies and improvements by reducing hardware moves and eliminating unnecessary\nrequirements by up to 40 percent throughout the\nmanufacture and assembly process at ATK facilities.\nThe SLS Booster Office completed its PDR in April\n2013 and is scheduled for its CDR in 2014. The booster flight set is slated for delivery to KSC for processing\nin mid-2017.\n\nFig. VIII: QM-1 center aft segment at ATK\xe2\x80\x99s test\narea, May 2013.\nGuy Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cHeavy Lifter: SLS development coming together as launch and ascent\nloads come into sharper focus,\xe2\x80\x9d Aviation\nWeek and Space Technology, July 29, 2013.\n11\nGuy Norris, \xe2\x80\x9cLoads Challenges Remain for\nSLS Design,\xe2\x80\x9d Aviation Week and Space\nTechnology, July 29, 2013.\n10\n\nIAC-13,D2.1,10x19760\n\nRS-25 Main Engines\nThe RS-25 main engine delivers more than 500,000\npounds of thrust at 109 percent rated power level.\nChris Bergen, \xe2\x80\x9cFull Steam Ahead for ATK\xe2\x80\x99s\nSLS Booster Drive,\xe2\x80\x9d May 4, 2013, http://\nwww.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/05/fullsteam-ahead-atk-sls-booster-drive/\n13\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlight Control Test 2 at ATK,\xe2\x80\x9d January\n2013, http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/sys\ntems/sls/multimedia/gallery/fct_test_1.html\n12\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\nProduced by Aerojet Rocketdyne, the RS-25 is the\nfirst reusable rocket engine in history, as well as the\nmost reliable and highly tested large rocket engine\never built. During the 30-year Space Shuttle era, the\nRS-25 achieved 100 percent mission success with a\ndemonstrated reliability exceeding 0.9996. During\n135 missions and related engine testing, the RS-25\nsystem accumulated over 1 million seconds of hotfire experience. Whereas the Shuttle flew a 3-engine\nconfiguration, the 70-t SLS will fly with 4 engines.\nThe SLS has 16 engines in its inventory at the Stennis\nSpace Center (SSC), enough for its first 4 missions.\nAt 100 m, the SLS is 42 m taller than the Shuttle,\nwhich results in higher LOX propellant inlet pressures\nin the engine, a challenge that is being worked from\nat least three angles: (1) slightly modifying the engine\nto adapt to expected pressures, (2) limiting maximum\npressure within mission profile changes through\nthrottling, and (3) modifying the start sequence.\nThe larger SLS core stage will result in lower LOX\ntemperatures, which have the potential to damage\nthe engine induced by temperature spikes during the\nstart sequence. After investigating several solutions,\nreducing pre-start bleed flows and modifying the start\nsequence, along with the use of lightweight, low-wattage heaters to warm the LOX before it enters the\nengine, are expected to solve this challenge with the\nleast amount of impact.\nSince the RS-25 production concluded several\nyears ago and the vendor and supplier chain has\nchanged, the SLS Engines Element Office has done\ninnovative research to prepare for future cost-effective engine production. One of these research areas\n\nis additive manufacturing, also known as three-dimensional (3-D) printing, which is reducing the time\nto manufacture certain parts from months to days,\nthereby reducing production costs to a fraction of\ntheir former expense. Another benefit is that quality\ncan be improved by making a homogenous part with\nno welds. Parts manufactured to date include the hot\ngas duct and turbine housing cover, both with excellent results during J-2X hot-fire testing (Fig. IX).14, 15\nThe J-2X engine development started under the\nConstellation Program has also resulted in a new\ncommon engine controller that is being adapted\nfor use by the RS-25, resulting in cost savings.16 The\nengine controller allows the vehicle and the engine\nto communicate, sending commands down to the\nengine and transmitting data back to the vehicle. The\ncontroller also provides closed-loop management of\nthe engine by regulating thrust and the fuel mixture\nratio while monitoring the engine\xe2\x80\x99s health and status.\nThis technology provides a modern foundation for\nfunctions such as throttling the engine \xe2\x80\x94 allowing it\nto fly in ways that minimize the loads that result from\nproducing 10 percent more thrust than the Saturn V\nMoon rocket.\nNASA plans to begin testing RS-25 engines in\n2014. The J-2X equipment installed on the A-1 Test\nStand could not be used to test RS-25 engines since it\ndoes not match the engine specifications and thrust\nrequirements, namely the J-2X engine produces\n294,000 pounds of thrust and the RS-25 engine produces over 500,000 pounds of thrust. Fabrication recently began at SSC on a new thrust frame adapter for\nthe A-1 Test Stand to enable this testing. This will be\nfollowed by core stage/main engine green run testing\nin 2016 on the B-2 Test Stand at SSC; refurbishments\nare now in progress.

The massive 8.4-m-diameter, 61-m-tall tank that forms the rocket\xe2\x80\x99s structural\nbackbone is being built by the Boeing Company at\nMAF, where the Saturn stages and Shuttle external\ntanks were manufactured. The stage, made of Aluminum 2219, will hold the 4 RS-25 main engines and\nLOX/LH2 propellants.\nFollowing a steady cadence of installing 6 substantial welding tools in MAF, the first LH2 tank barrel\nsegment was completed in July 2013 (Fig. X). It is\nconsidered a \xe2\x80\x9cconfidence\xe2\x80\x9d barrel segment because it\nvalidates the vertical weld center (VWC) is working\nthe way it should. The VWC is a friction-stir-weld\ntool for wet and dry structures on the SLS core stage.17\nCompleted in June, the VWC will weld barrel panels\ntogether to produce whole barrels for the core stage\xe2\x80\x99s\n2 pressurized tanks, the forward skirt, and the aft\nengine section. The massive machine stands 3 stories\ntall and weighs 136,000 kilograms (kg). The finished\nbarrel segment is 6.7-m tall and weighs 4,100 kg. The\nsegment will be used in structural tests to ensure the\nintegrity of the piece. Five similar barrels and 2 end\ndomes will be constructed to make up the SLS core\nstage LH2 tank.\n\nThe core stage also contains the instrument ring,\nwhich houses the vehicle-level avionics. The flight\ncomputers are currently in testing at the MSFC Software Development Facility in an effort to rapidly mature and ensure implementation of a safe and highly\nreliable avionics and software system. Following this\ntesting, the software will be installed and tested in the\nSystem Integration Test Facility, also at MSFC. These\nfacilities allow technicians to \xe2\x80\x9cfly\xe2\x80\x9d the vehicle through\nvirtual space and make adjustments accordingly.\nCurrently, over 200 design drawings are being released per month. The core stage PDR was completed\nin December 2012, 5 months ahead of schedule. The\ncore stage CDR is slated for mid-2014. All avionics\ncomponents have completed their PDRs, with some\nhaving completed CDR. In 2015, the avionics will be\nshipped to MAF for integration into the stage, where\nthe RS-25 engines will also be integrated. The integrated stage is due to be delivered to KSC for launch\nprocessing in late 2016/early 2017.\nSpacecraft and Payload Integration\nAs shown in the expanded view below (Fig. XI),\nthe Spacecraft and Payload Integration Office (SPIO)\nmanages three areas: (1) the MSA, discussed above,\nwhich will connect the Orion MPCV to the upper\nstage (refer to Fig. VII); (2) the launch vehicle stage\nadapter (LVSA), which will attach the mated upper\nstage and Orion to the rocket; and (3) the ICPS upper\nstage (Figure XII). In addition, this office has been\nperforming conceptual analyses of payload fairings\nto support SLS evolvability studies. The MSA is an inhouse development for the Exploration Flight Test in\n2014, and will be delivered to KSC for processing in\n\nFig. X: First LH2 tank confidence barrel section\nwelded at MAF, July 2013.\n17\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Liquid Hydrogen Tank Barrel Seg\nment for the SLS Core Stage Completed at\nMichoud,\xe2\x80\x9d http://www.nasa.gov/explor\nation/systems/sls/sls-barrel-at-michoud.\nhtml#.UfqSkeBcTga\n\nIAC-13,D2.1,10x19760\n\nFig. XI: Expanded view.\nPage 9 of 10\n\nFig. XII: Artist\xe2\x80\x99s concept of the ICPS with Orion\nin orbit.\nlate 2013. Also in late 2013, the LVSA will be competitively procured.18 SPIO completed its PDR in June\n2013.\nThe Delta IV cryogenic second stage (DCSS) has\ncompleted over 20 flights; however, this heritage\nhardware is being modified to the ICPS to perform\nthe SLS mission, including stretching the tank to hold\nthe propellants needed to send Orion to lunar orbit.\nThe RL10B-2 engine was rated for a certain set of\nloads and environments, so analyses are in progress to\ndetermine other modifications that might be needed\nto handle the higher performance of the SLS. Specifically, the lateral loads imparted at liftoff due to winds\nat the launch pad and the ascent loads generated by\naerodynamic buffeting exceed those of the DCSS\nenvironments for which the original hardware was\ndesigned. Mitigations include a T-zero stabilizer liftoff\nrestraint and release system at the launch pad, as well\nas system damping. For ascent, additional analyses are\nbeing conducted to determine the optimum solution\nsuch as active electromechanical actuators in the\nthrust vector control system that will adjust to the\npredicted aerodynamic environment. Using heritage\nand commercial hardware ultimately saves time and\nmoney, but comes with a set of engineering challenges and programmatic risks that must be managed to\nachieve the desired results.\n\nU.S. investment in space. To determine that its largescale initiatives are technically and fiscally sound, the\nAgency conducts stringent engineering and business\nevaluations to gauge progress and reduce the risk\nof doing things that have never been done before.\nThe SLS Program and its elements have successfully\ncompleted their Preliminary Design Reviews, during\nwhich progress was checked against rigorous engineering standards and well-defined management\npractices (refer to Fig. II). The next life-cycle milestone will be the Critical Design Review, slated for\n2015, further affirming that technical work is sound\nand management planning is sufficient to proceed to\nhardware manufacturing and testing on the road to\nvehicle integration and first flight in 2017 (Fig. XIII).\nFor demanding space missions, transportation\nsolutions must be robust. While the SLS team is\nfocused on delivering the initial 70-t launch capability, the vehicle is evolvable through selected hardware\nupgrades and developments into a 130-t rocket that\nwill be the largest ever built. The SLS Program is\nmaking significant progress toward delivering a new\ntransportation capability for deep-space missions that\nwill expand territories for commerce, rewrite textbooks with new discoveries, and push the envelope of\ntechnologies with terrestrial applications. The SLS is a\npowerful enterprise asset that will make possible these\nand other benefits for all Earth\xe2\x80\x99s people.\n\nIV.
