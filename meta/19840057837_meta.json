This situation implies that the payload could be increased if the volume for the additional payload were available on the STS. The employment of the External Tank (ET) Aft Cargo Carrier (ACC) would provide the additional volume needed and, thus, enable the STS to use its residual capability. The current ACC configuration is an evolution of two years of study. The ACC is a general purpose payload carrier which can be adapted to specific large diameter payloads. The improvement of the STS capabilities by the ACC is discussed, and future applications are considered.", "title": "External Tank Aft Cargo Carrier", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T03:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840057837, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mobley, T.
