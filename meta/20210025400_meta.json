My role in the project was to collect an initial literature survey on the subject including origami, the history of deployable space structures, previous issues and problems faced in the field, previous and current research being done on the structural aspect as well as the materials aspect of the subject. I presented this information to our team, where we discussed and determined our research focus and project design specs. We have been making or will make decisions on the project\u2019s purpose, material, origami type, manufacturing method, and testing methods. I am now in charge of the protype design as we enter the design stage of our research. I am using PTC Creo software to design the structural aspects of the first protype so that we can begin small scale testing. I will perform data analysis in order to review the results with our team, so we can make the next design decisions regarding changes or iterations of the design. We hope to renew this project in the next fiscal year in order to increase the TRL of the project so that it can eventually be used in multiple functions in space such as the construction of lunar habitats.\nIn just my brief time with NASA, I have gained so much personally and professionally. I developed my ability to search through and narrow down information when doing research. In the weekly meetings I practiced presenting information to my peers and superiors, and, just as importantly, discussing and adapting to what we were learning. I acquired experience in using technology to my advantage including remote work, new software like PTC Creo, NASA archives, and connecting with others beyond my team to gain help. \nI enjoyed the immense resource of knowledge that my mentors had to offer, and that they gave me a large amount of responsibility in this research. I truly felt like I was contributing to something bigger than myself and understood how directly I was involved in NASA\u2019s work. This internship has further cemented my love for space and desire to continue in the field. I have a better understanding of the research and development process and am now considering joining a research lab with my university next year.\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210025400, "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "68603dff261e5d2d9de5a550aa9e6b30", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "bbcb8b3b5daf494f8f74ff792a8fa44f", "id": "fed2f87292af49dd9ecf7952a813b88b"}], "name": "2021 Fall NIFS Intern Research Symposium", "location": "Virtual", "id": "bbcb8b3b5daf494f8f74ff792a8fa44f", "startDate": "2021-12-15T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Rebecca Hall 2021 FALL NIFS-Presentation.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210025400/downloads/Rebecca%20Hall%202021%20FALL%20NIFS-Presentation.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210025400/downloads/Rebecca%20Hall%202021%20FALL%20NIFS-Presentation.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210025400/downloads/Rebecca%20Hall%202021%20FALL%20NIFS-Presentation.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
