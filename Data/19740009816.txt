A fuse is connected in series with\nthe input conductor and a spark gap is connected between the input conductor and ground for conducting\nthe overvoltage current to ground and for blowing the\nfuse to open the circuit to the electrical equipment. A\npulse attenuator network is provided between the\nspark gap and the electrical equipment to be protected for attenuating the pulse of energy passing\nthrough the fuse and spark gap prior to blowing of the\nfuse. The pulse attenuator network includes additional\nshunt spark gaps, series inductance, and a series connection of a twisted shielded pair of conductors having\nlow-voltage insulation.\n3 Claims, 3 Drawing Figures\n\nTHERMO,\nCOUPLE\n(TYPICAL\nTRANSDUCER)\nX\n\nI SPARK\n| GAP\nFIRING\nVOLTS 90V[2pf | .\n\nI 100 FT.
