The components are held by an electrically insulating body having a central axis, a top axial end, and a bottom axial end. The cusped magnetic field is formed by a cylindrical magnet having an axis of rotation that is the same as the axis of rotation of the insulating body, and magnetized with opposite poles at its two axial ends; and an annular magnet coaxially surrounding the cylindrical magnet, magnetized with opposite poles at its two axial ends such that a top axial end has a magnetic polarity that is opposite to the magnetic polarity of a top axial end of the cylindrical magnet. The ionizing gas source is a tubular plenum that has been curved into a substantially annular shape, positioned above the top axial end of the annular magnet such that the plenum is centered in a ring-shaped cusp of the magnetic field generated by the magnets. The plenum has one or more capillary-like orifices spaced around its top such that an ionizing gas supplied through the plenum is sprayed through the one or more orifices. The plenum is electrically conductive and is positively charged relative to the cathode electron source such that the plenum functions as the anode; and the cathode is positioned above and radially outward relative to the plenum.", "title": "Compact plasma accelerator", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080007439, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Foster, John E."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "c8219928ccce44bd8737accd926da68d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080007439, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080007439, "id": "222b7f0d080c457db249557176e0f81f", "publicationDate": "2004-02-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080007439.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080007439/downloads/20080007439.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080007439/downloads/20080007439.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080007439/downloads/20080007439.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
