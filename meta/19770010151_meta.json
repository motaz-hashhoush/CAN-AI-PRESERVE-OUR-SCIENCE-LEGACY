These programs were proposed in an attempt to enhance existing engine systems, exploiting their potential for emission reduction as far as is compatible with retaining the well established features in them that are well understood and in current production. The intended programs identified in the area of new concepts were: (1) upgrading the TCM fuel system, (2) evaluation of accelerator pump, (3) reduced cooling requirement, and (4) variable spark timing.", "title": "Future development programs", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T19:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770010151, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Waters, L."}, "organization": {"name": "Teledyne Continental Motors", "location": "Mobile, AL, United States"}}, "id": "5eb337a188864d66a82ef48dad8131c8"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19770010151, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770010151, "id": "884a1b7edc564b2d84403e543c5e8a06", "publicationName": "NASA.
