This concept leverages elements  developed through the UAS Traffic Management project with respect to a coopertive, service-based approach that provides services and capabilities in areas (e.g., Upper E airspace) that currently receive no or limited service from Air Traffic Control. This concept is meant to provide a safe, fair, and scalable approach to management of Upper E operations that reduces the burden on ATC while providing the flexibility and access desired by current and new users of the airspace. This set of slides includes an overview of discussions and industry news covering the time since the previous group meeting, a presentation on initial work titled 'Sensitivity Study of Minimum Reserved Airspace in ETM Operations,' and a high level discussion titled 'Separation Management Service Framework for ETM.'
