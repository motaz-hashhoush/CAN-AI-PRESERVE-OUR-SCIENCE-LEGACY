The ice stream has a number of the characteristics of the more closely studied ice streams in Antarctica, including its large size and gross geometry. The onset of rapid flow close to the ice divide and the evolution of its flow pattern, however, make this ice stream unique. These features can be seen in the balance velocities for the ice stream (Joughin 1997) and its outlets. The ice stream is identifiable for more than 700 km, making it much longer than any other flow feature in Greenland. Our research goals are to gain a greater understanding of the ice flow in the northeast Greenland ice stream and its outlet glaciers in order to assess their impact on the past, present, and future mass balance of the ice sheet. We will accomplish these goals using a combination of remotely sensed data and ice sheet models. We are using satellite radar interferometry data to produce a complete maps of velocity and topography over the entire ice stream. We are in the process of developing methods to use these data in conjunction with existing ice sheet models similar to those that have been used to improve understanding of the mechanics of flow in Antarctic ice streams.", "title": "Ice Flow in the North East Greenland Ice Stream", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T04:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990071137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Joughin, Ian"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "48f04e096f924e69a8773448bd1633c7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990071137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kwok, Ron"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA United States"}}, "id": "3705cfc6c8884eb79066f1b21ffb6c48"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19990071137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fahnestock, M."}, "organization": {"name": "Maryland Univ.", "location": "College Park, MD United States"}}, "id": "a64a9077599043eb9f570eebd8d9b120"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19990071137, "meta": {"author": {"name": "MacAyeal, Doug"}, "organization": {"name": "Chicago Univ.", "location": "Chicago, IL United States"}}, "id": "066cad4d26c94ed2a82d86f3662d370c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990071137, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990071137, "id": "aee8dc473d3345469db6a7122f672f01", "publicationName": "Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA)", "publicationDate": "1999-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19990071134, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Program for Arctic Regional Climate Assessment (PARCA)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
