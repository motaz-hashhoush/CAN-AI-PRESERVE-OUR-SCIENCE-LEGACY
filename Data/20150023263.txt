Childhood\nobesity is global public health concern including in\nSouth Korea where 16.2% of boys and 9.9% of girls\nare overweight or obese in 2011.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Effective and sustainable intervention programs are\nneeded for prevention of childhood obesity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Obesity prevention programs for young children may\nhave a greater intervention effect than in older\nchildren.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The NASA Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut (MX)\nprogram was developed to promote children\xe2\x80\x99s\nexercise and healthy eating by tapping into their\nexcitement for training like an astronaut.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This study aimed to examine the feasibility and\neffectiveness of the adapted NASA MX intervention in\npromoting PA in young children and in improving\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 related perspectives.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Total 212 healthy 5-year-old children were enrolled\nthrough three specified kindergartens in the cities of\nSeoul, O-san, and Yong-in.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An age-appropriate curriculum and a teacher\nguidebook were developed in Korean after adapting\nMX program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This 6- week curriculum covered physical activity (PA)\nand nutrition education and conducted by eight lead\nteachers of Kindergarten during fall 2014.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Parents responded to the pre- and post- survey\nquestionnaires (n=154).\nTable 1.

Parental attitude and beliefs on their child\xe2\x80\x99s PA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Child weight status was classified using BMI percentiles\nfrom the Korean CDC growth chart (Overweight\xe2\x89\xa5 85%tile\nand underweight<10%tile; KCDC, 2007).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Godin Leisure-time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin G, et\nal., 1997) and psychological need satisfaction after\nexercise (Wilson PM et al, 2006) were used to test\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s change after this intervention program.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAll pre and post differences by paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed\nrank test were significant (p< 0.05). All X2 tests for differences by\nsex and weight status were insignificant.\n\nTable 1.
