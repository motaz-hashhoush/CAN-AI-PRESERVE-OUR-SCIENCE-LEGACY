b"At right is a Maxwell\n\n'Ihepower\n\nsupplies are\nthefirst\n\ncommercial\nspin08\nfrom the\nCCDS\n\nprogram\n\nModel CCDS-225\nCapacitor Charging\nPower Supply, one of 63\nmodels in the\ncommercial CCDS series\nproduced by Maxwell\nLaboratories, Inc., San\nDiego, Califomia. The\nseries is named for\nNASA's Centers for the\nCommercial\nDevelopment of Space,\nwhich are competitively\nselected consortia of\nindustrial f i s ,\nuniversities and\ngovernment\norganizations established\nI\nto accelerate\ndevelopment of\ntechnology for both\nground-based and\nspace-based commercial applications.\nThe CCDS series was co-developed by Maxwell\nLaboratories and one of the 16 CCDS, the Center for\nCommercial Development of Space Power, Aubum\nUniversity, Alabama. Maxwell will share with the\nAuburn center revenues from sales of the CCDS\nseries.\nThe first commercial spinoff from the CCDS\nprogram, the power supplies are rectangular units\nabout the size of a stereo receiver. Their job is to\ntransform and condition large voltages (up to 50\nkilovolts) to charge capacitors used in such devices\nas x-ray sources, medical accelerators, radar and\nmicrowave communications equipment, and\nindustrial lasers used for marking, cutting and\nwelding operations. The system is lighter, more\nreliable, more compact and more efficient than\nexisting systems that do the same job, its developers\n\nsay; these features are critical to industrial, medical\nand space applications.\nWork began on the system in 1988, originally\nconceived as a lightweight high voltage power\nsupply to charge capacitors used mainly in NASA\nspace lasers, which perform guidance,\ncommunications and weather monitoring functions.\nEarly in the program it was recognized that there was\na need and a market for an efficient capacitor\ncharging power supply in terrestrial applications. By\nthe fall of 1988, the MaxwelVAubum team had\ndeveloped several prototype designs for the\ncommercial unit. The design was finalized in\nFebruary 1989 and in May of that year an\nengineering prototype c o n f i e d product\nperformance. Production for the commercial market\nbegan in 1990.\n\n1\n\n"
