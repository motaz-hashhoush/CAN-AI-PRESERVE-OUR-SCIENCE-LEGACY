Several studies in recent years have investigated the use of\nphotorefractive\ncrystals for storing holographic image information.\nHowever, all of the previous studies\nhave focused on techniques for storing information\nin a single crystal. The disadvantage\nof using a single\ncrystal is that the read process is destructive.\nResearchers have developed techniques for fixing the\ninformation\nin a crystal so that it may be read many times. However, when f\'uted, the information\ncannot be\nreadily erased and overwritten with new information.\nIf two photorefractive\ncrystals are used, holographic\nimage information may be stored dynamically.\nThat is, the stored image information\nmay be read out more\nthan once and, it may be easily erased and overwritten\nwith new image information.\n\nIo_mxtur,\nlL_\n\nIn the mid 1960\'s, researchers\ndiscovered what has come to be known as the photorefractive\neffect.\nCertain types of crystals, when placed in the optical cavities of lasers, were found to 3uffer "optical damage"\nafter a brief period of time (ref. 1). Later, it was determined that the crystals were in fact not damaged, but\nrather had the remarkable property that when exposed to light would undergo a change in refractive index.\nIn the late 1960\'s, researchers realized that this property could be exploited and these crystals could be used\nto record holographic\ninformation (ref. 2). When exposed to multiple coherent interfering beams of light,\nthese crystals will record (on a microscopic level) the interference patterns generated by the beams. These\ninterference patterns (recorded as a change in the index of refraction) are phase holograms or holographic\ngratings.\nThe mechanism by which holograms are recorded in photorefractive\ncrystals can be understood with a\nsimple example. In figure 1 is a drawing showing two coherent plane wave beams of light with wave\nvectors _:1 and !\xc2\xa22 intersecting at some angle 20 in a photorefractive\ncrystal. The alternating dark and light\nbands within the region of intersection represent the light distribution resulting from interference of the two\nbeams.\n\nThe spacing of the bands is described\n\nby the spatial frequency\nk=21_l\n\nk, where\n\nIsin0\n\nFor very small angles of 0, the spacing of the bands of light will be very fine. On a microscopic\nlevel, the\nindividual atoms of the crystal are exposed to alternating bands of light and dark. In the illumninated\nregions, light is absorbed, causing excitation of trapped charges within the crystalline structure.\nThe excited\ncharges migrate and become retrapped in regions of low light intensity (the dark bands). This results in\ncharge separation within the crystal. This charge separation sets up a strong static electric field which in\nturn causes a change in the refractive index of the crystal due to the linear electro-optic effect (ref. 3). As\nshown in figure 2, the induced change in refractive index mimics the interference pattern except it is shifted\nin space n/\'2 out of phase with respect to the incident light intensity pattern. The microscopic\nspatial\nvariation in the refractive index of the crystal produced by the interference of two coherent beams of light is\na type of hologram known as a phase hologram.\nHolograms of objects differ from photographs\nin that they are not a record of the light intensity\ndistribution reflected from an object, but rather a record of the amplitude and phase distribution of light\n\n101\n\nreflected from an object. When holograms are illuminated, the amplitude and phase of the wavefront of the\nlight reflected from (or transmitted through) the original object are reconstructed.\nTo an observer, this\nwavefront is indistinguishable\nfrom the wavefront reflected off the object itself and the observer therefore\n"sees" the original object in three dimensions.\nIt is by illuminating\nthe hologram that the information\nstored in the hologram is read out. Unlike a holographic grating recorded in film or other fixed media, when\na holographic grating in a photorefractive\ncrystal is illuminated, the charges in the crystal redistribute and\nthe grating is erased. For this reason, the read process, if separated from the write process, is destructive.\nThe optical storage device described herein uses a four-wave mixing geometry to store holograms in\ntwo photorefractive\ncrystals. In four-wave mixing, the read and write processes are combined.\nThree\ncoherent beams of light are incident on a photorefractive\ncrystal as shown schematically\nin figure 3. One\nbeam, denoted as the object beam carries the information to be stored in the form of a complex phase and\namplitude distribution.\nThis beam is interferred with a plane wave reference, denoted as the write beam in\nfigure 3, thereby generating a complicated interference pattern which is recorded in the crystal as described\npreviously.\nA third beam, denoted as the read beam, is a plane wave reference beam counterpropagating\nwith respect to the write beam. When the holographic grating is illuminated by the read beam, a portion of\nthe read beam is diffracted by the grating and reconstructs the phase conjugate of the object beam. The\nphase conjugate is counterpmpagating\nwith respect to the object beam. It is a time-reversed\nreplica of the\nobject beam.\nIn the optical storage device, holographic information is recorded in two photorefractive\ncrystals. An\nobject wave bearing the information\nto be stored is interferred with a plane wave reference or write beam,\nand the resulting interference pattern is stored in the fh-st of two photorefractive\ncrystals. A second plane\nwave reference or read beam is diffracted by this grating and reconstructs the phase conjugate of the original\nobject wave. This phase conjugate is interfered with a third plane wave reference and the resulting\ninterference pattern is stored in the second crystal. A fourth reference wave reconstructs the phase conjugate\nof the phase conjugate, which is just a reconstructed\nversion of the original object wave. The reconstructed\nobject wave is directed back to the first crystal to rerecord the original grating. The advantage in using two\ncrystals over one is now obvious. The holographic information can be read out without being lost. Each\ncrystal refreshs the information\nwritten in the other crystal. A diagram of the two-cystal memory is shown\nin figure 4. To read out the information,\na beamsplitter\nis inserted in the cavity formed by the two crystals,\nas depicted in the figure.\nThe above discussion is a simple description of how the two-crystal optical storage device works.\nHowever, to fully appreciate how the device works, and some of the potential difficulties encountered in\ndeveloping an implementable\ndesign, a more detailed discussion of the theory and some preliminary\nexperimental\nresults will be presented.\nTheory_ of _Operation\nBecause the photorefractive\ncrystal generates a phase conjugate of the original object beam, it is referred\nto as a phase conjugate mirror or PCM. The reflectivity of the phase conjugate mirror is defined as the\nratio of the intensity of the phase conjugate wave to the intensity of the incident object wave. Using a\nfour-wave mixing geometry, it is possible with proper beam geometries to have reflectivities\ngreater than\n1.0 (ref. 4). As a result, it is possible to build optical resonators using phase conjugate mirrors in place of\nconventional\nmirrors. The optical storage device is a type of phase conjugate resonator.\nThe image\ninformation,\nin the form of a complex wavefront, oscillates between two photorefractive\ncrystals or phase\nconjugate mirrors. In the literature, the term double phase conjugate resonator is used to describe this type\nof oscillator.\nModelling the behavior of phase conjugate resonators has been the subject of intense research over the\nlast ten years (refs. 5-7). Phase conjugate resonators differ from conventional\nresonators in some important\nways. Two which are relevant to the optical storage device are; 1) the frequency of the light will shift or\ndetune in a two-crystal oscillator to compensate for phase mismatches at the boundaries, and; 2) the\nstructure of the light beam in the transverse direction, or the direction normal to propagation,\nis not subject\nto the same constraints as in the case of an optical resonator formed by two mirrors. First, the effect of\nfrequency detuning on the design of the optical storage device will be addressed.\nAccording to theory and\nexperiments,\nthe frequency detuning is a function of the cavity length and can be changed by adjusting the\nlength of the cavity (ref. 7). No frequency shift takes place provided that the cavity length is set so that the\nphase after one roundtrip is an integral multiple of 2u. However, maintaining this exact distance over time\nis difficult. In the optical storage device, a second feedback loop is provided to maintain the phase match if\nso desired. The total light output of the cavity is detected with a photodetector,\nthe output of the\n\n102\n\nphotodetector is phase shifted, and the phase shifted signal is used to drive an acousto-optic modulator\nwhich amplitude modulates the write beam on the first crystal. By amplitude modulating the write beam,\nthe phase of the phase conjugate wave can be varied and adjusted.\nIn this way, the phase match at the\nboundaries can be maintained.\nThe second difference stated above does not directly affect the design of the\nstorage device, but is the fundamental\nreason why a phase conjugate resonator can be used to store\nholographic images. With conventional\noscillators, where a beam of light oscillates between two mirrors\n(as in a laser cavity), only certain structures are allowed in the transverse direction. That is, because of the\nboundary conditions, and the conditions required for oscillation, the structure of the beam, or intensity\nprofile, can take on only one of a set of distinct patterns. These patterns correspond to what are known as\nthe transverse modes of the resonator (ref.8). When the mirrors of the conventional resonator are replaced\nwith phase conjugate mirrors, the boundary conditions change. Theory predicts that the transverse modes\nare no longer restricted in form. Therefore, a very complex form or structure, or multiple transverse modes\n(of the form predicted for a conventional resonator) may be supported simultaneously\nwithin the cavity (ref.\n\n6).\nThe structure, or lack of structure, in the transverse direction predicted for the phase conjugate resonator\nmeans that a wavefront of arbitrary phase and amplitude profile can be maintained in the resonator cavity.\nTherefore, theoretically,\nholographic image information can be stored as a complex wavefront in the cavity\nformed by two phase conjugate mirrors. This is the theory behind the operation of the optical storage\ndevice.\nEx_Derimental Results\nExperiments\nhave been carried out to study the image information storage capability of a two crystal\noscillator (ref. 9). In figure 5 is a picture of the optical setup. The smaller photograph,,\na picture of the\nAirforce Resolution chart, is the image output from the cavity of the two PCM resonator.\nFor this\nparticular setup, the gain of the cavity was slightly less than one. As a result, the image could not be\nretained for an indefinite period of time. Rather, the image was stored for approximately\na minute. This\nrepresents more than a factor of 100 increase over the length of time the image could be stored in one\ncrystal for the geometries and power levels which were used.\nWhen the power levels and beam ratios were set such as to achieve a gain in the cavity in excess of 1.0,\nthe transverse structure of the beam was corrupted for some of the experimental\nruns. A particular\n(repeatable) pattern emerged. This was not anticipated.\nAccording to theory, as described above, the\ntransverse modes of a PCM resonator are degenerate, meaning that the energy of all transverse modes is the\nsame. This being true, no one mode or combination\nof modes should dominate.\nFurther experiments and\nanalyses are required to explain the observed phenomenon.\nThe feedback described above for amplitude modulating the write beam was tested experimentally.\nThe\noptical setup is shown in the diagram of figure 6. It was found that the ability to control the phase of the\nphase conjugate wave was limited by the amplifier which was used to phase shift the light signal. It was\npossible to affect the phase of the phase conjugate, but it was not possible to stabilize the oscillation with\nthe setup that was used. Further experiments are planned along these lines.\nConclusions\nA design has been proposed for an optical storage device which can store holographic\ninformation in\ntwo photorefractive\ncrystals. The advantages of using photorefractive\ncrystals is that these crystals provide\nthe capability of recording holographic image information at near real-time rates and promise high storage\ndensities. Potential applications\nfor optical storage devices such as the one described in this paper include\nstorage of holographic\nimage information for distributed sensing and processing.\nA conceptual design of a\ndistributed sensor and processor for large flexible space structures is described in reference 10. All of the\ntechniques which have been developed for holographic sensing of structures using fixed media can now,\nwith the development\nof a dynamic holographic recording media, be used to develop sensors which can\nmeasure the motion of structures.\nThe image resolution which can ultimately be achieved using photorefractive\ncrystals is unknown.\nThe\nresolution is a function of the size of the crystal. Techniques\nare currently being studied which will allow\ncrystals of larger sizes to be grown. Presently, the crystals are limited in size to approximately\n5 mm\ncubes (BaTiO3).\nThe growth of photorefractive\nthin films is also being explored.\nThin films are much\neasier to grow, can be fabricated in much larger sizes, and require less time to grow than bulk crystals.\n\n103\n\nUsing BaTiO3 crystals, experiments have been\noptical storage device.
