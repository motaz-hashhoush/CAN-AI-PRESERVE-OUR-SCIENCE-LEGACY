The capabilities of this system could also be\nused in diverse terrestrial applications\nthat involve measurement of signal\nphases, including metrology, navigation,\nand communications. The capabilities\nof this system include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Accuracy to within a millionth of a\ncycle (greater than the accuracy of any\nprior phase meter);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High dynamic range of phase (limited\nonly by numerical capabilities of a supporting computer);\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wide input frequency range (\xe2\x89\x8810 kHz\nto \xe2\x89\x8820 MHz),\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintenance of accuracy even when the\nfrequency of a signal slews by as much as\n700 kHz/s within this range; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ability to distinguish and measure\nmultiple tones on the same carrier\nwith undiminished accuracy.\nIn the operation of this system, two RF\nmodulated laser beams interfere on a\nphotodiode; their frequency difference\nresults in a RF heterodyne signal. The\n\nRF signal output by the photodiode is\ndigitized at 40 Mega-samples/s, then fed\ninto a field-programmable gate array\n(FPGA). The digitized heterodyne signal is split and multiplied by two adjustable local oscillators (LOs), which\nseparates the signal into in-phase (I) cosine and a quadrature phase (Q) sine\ncomponents. During stable operation at\na small phase difference between the RF\nand LO signals, the Q multiplier output\nincludes a low-frequency component\nproportional to the phase difference.\nThis phase-difference output is used to\nupdate the LO frequency (and, thereby,\nthe LO phase) to keep the local oscillators locked to the incoming signal. The\ntracking loop updates the LO frequency\nevery 0.1 ms.\nWhile this makes for a stable digital\nphase-locked loop, to achieve the desired micro-cycle phase accuracy, the\nresidual phase-tracking error is combined with the LO phase. The residual\nphase difference is computed as the arctangent of the ratio between the Q and I\nsignals, filtered appropriately, and\nadded to the phase used to update the\nlocal oscillators.\nFor transmission to ground, the phase\nmeasurements are decimated from 40\nMHz to the frequency-and-phase-update\n\nrate of 10 kHz, then again to a final output rate of 100 Hz. To suppress aliasing\nof noise in the signal band from 1 mHz\nto 1 Hz in the decimation from 40 MHz\nto 10 kHz, an anti-aliasing filter is applied prior to decimation. After the reconstruction of phase at 10 kHz and\nprior to the final decimation to 100 Hz,\nanother finite-impulse-response antialiasing decimation filter is applied. The\ncharacteristics of the antialiasing filters\nare tailored to the phase noise of the\ninput signal.\nThis work was done by Daniel Shaddock,\nBrent Ware, Peter Halverson, and Robert\nSpero of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The apparatus was originally intended for use in assessing the ability of\nscientific instruments in spacecraft to\nwithstand cushioned impacts of landings on remote planets. Although such\nlandings can have impact velocities of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\n20 to 50 m/s, the decelerations must\nnot exceed a few hundred g. This requires the deceleration to occur over a\ndistance of as much as 50 cm in a time\nof tens of milliseconds. This combination of conditions is surprisingly difficult to simulate on the ground. The apparatus could also be used for general\nimpact testing.\nThe apparatus is simple to build. Relative to drop-tower apparatuses that\ncould produce equivalent impacts, this\n\napparatus is very compact. This apparatus is also relatively safe to operate because its design inherently prevents the\nobject under test or any debris from accidentally striking persons or equipment\nin the vicinity.\nThe apparatus (see figure) includes a\nsteel pipe having an inside diameter of\n20 cm and a length of 216 cm. A lightweight polyethylene piston carries the\nobject under test. The piston is sealed to\nthe inner wall of the pipe by means of a\n\n5\n\nTo Vacuum\nPump\nObject\nUnder Test\n\nAir Compressed by\nPiston\n\nPiston\n\nLatch\n\nPartial\nVacuum\n\nPiston at\nInitial Position\n\nPressure\nGauge\n\nPiston at\nMaximum Excursion\n(Maximum Compression)\n\nAtmospheric Pressure Drives the Piston along the partially evacuated pipe toward the closed end. The piston is then decelerated strongly when it compresses the remaining air at the closed end of the pipe.\n\ngasket. One end of the pipe is open; the\nopposite end of the pipe is closed and\nconnected to a vacuum pump.\nAt the beginning of a test, the piston is\nheld at the open end of the pipe by use\nof a latch while the vacuum pump is activated to introduce a partial vacuum [typically, characterized by an absolute pressure of 0.2 bar (20 kPa)] between the\npiston and the closed end. Once the desired partial vacuum has been reached,\nthe latch is released so that differential\npressure (atmospheric minus partial vacuum) accelerates the piston along the\npipe toward the closed end. The piston\n\nreaches a maximum speed typically between 20 and 40 m/s, the exact value depending on the mass of the object under\ntest and the starting pressure in the\npartly evacuated volume. As the piston\napproaches the closed end, it compresses the air ahead of it until, at a distance between 5 and 20 cm from the\nclosed end, the pressure becomes high\nenough to stop the piston (and bounce\nit back toward its starting position). An\naccelerometer on the piston measures\nthe impact deceleration.\nThe impact deceleration is a strong\nfunction of the amount of gas (and,\n\nhence, of the pressure) initially in the\npartially evacuated volume at the\nclosed end of the pipe. Therefore, it is\neasy to adjust the peak deceleration by\nadjusting the pressure of the partial\nvacuum. The maximum speed is not a\nstrong function of the mass of the object under test or of the starting partialvacuum pressure but can be tailored\nover a wide range by using pipes of different length.\nThis work was done by Pat R. Roach and Jeffrey Feller of Ames Research Center.

The platforms contemplated\nin the proposal would be primarily\nspacecraft, but, in principle, the proposal could also apply to aircraft. The\nproblem of measuring rainfall velocity\nfrom a moving platform is especially\nchallenging because the velocity of the\nplatform (especially in the case of a\nspacecraft) can be so large that it is difficult to distinguish between the rainfall\nand platform contributions to Doppler\nfrequency shifts. Furthermore, nonuniform filling of radar beams can lead to\nbiases in Doppler estimates. Although it\nmight be possible to reduce these biases\nthrough improved data processing, a\n\n6\n\npotential alternative is to use multiple\nantennas positioned at suitable alongtrack intervals.\nThe basic principle of the proposed\nsystems is a variant of that of alongtrack interferometric synthetic-aperture radar systems used previously to\nmeasure ocean waves and currents. The\nsimplest system according to the proposal would include two antennas that\nwould perform cross-track scans as in a\nprior rainfall-measuring radar system.\nThe antennas would be located at different along-track positions. The alongtrack distance between them would be\nchosen, in conjunction with the alongtrack velocity of the platform and the\nradar\npulse-repetition\nfrequency\n(PRF), such that this distance would\n\nequal the distance traveled by the platform between two successive pulses. (If\nnecessary, the PRF could be adjusted to\nenforce this equality.) Thus, in effect,\ntwo sets of measurements would be performed at each platform position.\nUnder this condition, extraction of the\nrainfall Doppler velocity without the\nplatform contribution is substantially\nsimplified and can be done with only\nminor modification of processing techniques traditionally used for groundbased Doppler radars.\nThis work was done by Stephen Durden, Simone Tanelli, and Paul Siqueira of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Further information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nNPO-44018\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\n600-GHz Electronically Tunable Vector Measurement System\nThe design satisfies a complex set of technical and economic requirements.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA compact, high-dynamic-range, electronically tunable vector measurement system that operates in the frequency range\nfrom \xe2\x89\x88560 to \xe2\x89\x88635 GHz has been developed as a prototype of vector measurement systems that would be suitable for\nuse in nearly-real-time active submillimeter-wave imaging. A judicious choice of intermediate frequencies makes it possible\nto utilize a significant amount of commercial off-the-shelf communication hardware\nin this system to keep its cost relatively low.\nThe electronic tunability of this system has\nbeen proposed to be utilized in a yet-to-bedeveloped imaging system in which a frequency-dispersive lens would be used to\nsteer transmitted and received beams in\none dimension as a function of frequency.\nThen acquisition of a complete image\ncould be effected by a combination of frequency sweeping for scanning in the aforesaid dimension and mechanical scanning\nin the perpendicular dimension.\nAs used here, \xe2\x80\x9cvector measurement\nsystem\xe2\x80\x9d signifies an instrumentation system that applies a radio-frequency (RF)\nexcitation to an object of interest and\nmeasures the resulting amplitude and\nphase response, relative to either the applied excitatory signal or another reference signal related in a known way to applied excitatory signal. In the case of\nactive submillimeter-wave imaging, the\nRF excitation would be a submillimeterwavelength signal radiated from an antenna aimed at an object of interest, and\nthe response signal would be a replica of\n\nthe RF excitation as modified in amplitude and phase by reflection from or\ntransmission through the object.\nThe system is depicted schematically\nin the figure. The ultimate sources of the\nRF excitation and reference signals and\nof local-oscillator (LO) signals for use in\ndown-conversion of the response signal\nare two compact, inexpensive microwave\nsynthesizers that are electronically tunable over the frequency range from 14 to\n18 GHz in increments of 250 kHz. The\noutputs of both synthesizers are multiplied \xc3\x976 in frequency. The resulting signals, having frequencies in the neighborhood of 100 GHz, are amplified \xe2\x89\x8820 dB\nby a pair of monolithic microwave integrated-circuit (MMIC) amplifiers. Then\none of the amplified signals is further\nmultiplied \xc3\x976 in frequency for use as the\nRF excitation signal, while the other is\nfurther multiplied \xc3\x973 in frequency for\nuse as the LO signal in a subharmonically pumped mixer.\nThe RF excitation signal is radiated and\nmade to pass through or reflect from an\nobject of interest, and the response signal\nis mixed with the aforementioned subharmonic LO signal to generate a down-converted signal [denoted an intermediatefrequency (IF) signal in the radio art].\nThe RF and LO synthesizers are controlled from a laptop computer, which adjusts their frequencies to keep the IF constant at 450 MHz. Thus, the RF- and\nLO-synthesizer outputs differ in frequency\nby 450/36 = 12.5 MHz.\n\nThe phase and amplitude measurements are performed indirectly, on signals derived from the IF signal, rather\nthan directly on the RF response signal.\nFor the purpose of generating a phase\nreference signal, portions of the outputs\nof the RF and LO synthesizers are\nmixed, yielding a 12.5-MHZ signal,\nwhich is then multiplied \xc3\x9736 in frequency to obtain another 450-MHz signal. This 450-MHz signal cannot be used\ndirectly as the phase reference signal because the outputs of the inexpensive microwave synthesizers have such poor\nphase-noise characteristics that this signal and the 450-MHz IF signal are indistinguishable from the accompanying\nphase noise. Therefore, it is necessary to\nperform further processing as described\nnext.\nIn particular, it is necessary to further reference both the 450-MHz IF and the 450MHz reference signal to a stable source before\ndetection.\nThis\ninvolves\ndown-converting the raw 450-MHz reference signal by 12.79 MHz by use of a 12.79MHz fundamental crystal oscillator, a\nmixer, and a band-pass filter. The resultant\n437.21-MHz signal is then mixed with the\n450-MHz IF signal. Inasmuch as the phase\nnoises of the 437.21-MHz signal and the\n450-MHz IF signal are totally correlated,\nmixing these two signals cancels out that\nnoise, leaving a 12.79-MHz signal that has\nthe same amplitude and phase characteristics (minus the synthesizer noise) as does\nthe 450-MHz IF signal.\n\nObject of Interest\nAbout\n15.56 to\n17.64\nGHz\n\nMicrowave\nSynthesizers\n\n\xc3\x976\n\nAbout\n15.54 to\n17.63\nGHz\n\n\xc3\x976\n\nAbout\n93.33 to\n105.83\nGHz\nAbout\n93.26 to\n105.76\nGHz\n\n\xc3\x976\n\n560 to\n635\nGHz\n\nRF Response\n\nRF\nExcitation\n\xc3\x973\n\nIF\n\nIF\n\n450\nMHz\nLO/2\n\n450 MHz\n\nAbout 279.78 to\n317.28 GHz\n437.21\nMHz\n\nRF/36\n\nLO/36\n12.79\nMHz\n\n\xc3\x9736\n450\nMHz\n\n12.5\nMHz\n\n12.79\nMHz\n\nBand-Pass Filter\n462.79,\n450, 437.21\nMHz\n437.21\nMHz\n\nREFERENCE\nCHANNEL\nReference\nSignal\nTracking\nDown-Converter\n\nCrystal\nOscillator\n\nLock-In\nAmplifier\nResponse\nSignal\n\nThis Vector Measurement System is made from a combination of commercially available and custom components.

It is therefore essential that\nthe 437.21-MHz band-pass filter have extremely high rejection at 450 MHz.\nThe 12.79-MHz signals in the response and reference channels are converted to a frequency of \xe2\x89\x8866 kHz in a\ntracking down-converter, then detected\nby a lock-in amplifier that functions as a\nvariable-bandwidth magnitude and\n\nphase receiver.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA modular architecture has been conceived for the design of radiation-monitoring instruments used aboard spacecraft\nand in planetary-exploration settings. This\narchitecture reflects lessons learned from\nexperience with prior radiation-monitoring instruments. A prototype instrument\nthat embodies the architecture has been\ndeveloped as part of the Mars Advanced\nRadiation Acquisition (MARA) project.\nThe architecture is also applicable on\nEarth for radiation-monitoring instruments in research of energetic electrically\ncharged particles and instruments monitoring radiation for purposes of safety, military defense, and detection of hidden nuclear devices and materials.\nWhereas prior such instruments have\ncontained\nnon-radiation-hardened\nparts, an instrument according to this\narchitecture is made of radiation-hardened/radiation-tolerant parts, enabling\nthe instrument to resist damage by the\nradiation that it is intended to measure.\nOne of the building blocks in this modular architecture is a single-channel radiation-detection circuit, which is essentially\na\ndetector\ninterface,\nsignal-processing and measurement circuit, dedicated to a single radiation detector that provides radiation-event data\nto the CPU. The interface between the\nsingle-channel radiation-detection circuit and the rest of the instrument is a\nPC/104\ncomputer-bus\ninterface.\n[PC/104 is an industry standard for\ncompact, stackable modules that are\ncompatible (in architecture, hardware,\nand software) with personal-computer\ndata and power-bus circuitry.] Multiple\nsingle-channel radiation-detection cir-\n\n8\n\ncuits can be stacked to create a multipledetector instrument.\nThe present architecture as embodied\nin the MARA instrument design offers the\nfollowing advantages over the architectures and designs of prior radiation-monitoring systems:\nThe detector interface circuitry in\nprior instruments included voltagefeedback operational amplifiers, which\ndo not enable accurate tracking of the\nrising edges of incoming pulses and, as\na result, do not enable deterministic\ndiscrimination among different levels\nof radiation events. In contrast, the\nMARA circuit design provides the capa-\n\nbility to more accurately differentiate\namong different types of energetic\ncharged particles.\nUnlike prior designs, the MARA design\nprovides for correlated double sampling,\nwhich offers the advantage of subtraction of correlated noise between reset\nsamples and data samples, thereby reducing spurious offsets and the effects of\nlow-frequency noise.\nPrior designs do not afford enough dynamic range to enable detection of both\nlow- and high-energy events without adjustment by an operator. The MARA design\nfeatures 16-bit quantization depth, which\nprovides sufficient dynamic range to en-\n\nSpace Radiation Detection and Measurement for:\nCEV, Moon, Mars, Shuttle & Station\n\n\xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 Type Detector\nin Housing\n\nFront Panel Future\nSpacecraft Interfaces\n\nMARA Detector\nInterface Circuit\n\nEthernet\nSingle Board Computer\nPower Supply\n\nMARA Instrument Phase I Prototype is shown in two-detector configuration.

In contrast,\nthe present architecture provides for distributed processing with local memory,\nenabling each board to independently\nsample events and store data pertaining\nto them. This architecture facilitates\nprompt reading of time-critical data signals in a consistent operation.

The MARA design enables remote loading of modifications of\nfirmware and/or replacement of cor-\n\nrupted firmware files with firmware files\nof known integrity.\nPrior designs used a text-based user interface for command and control.\nMARA employs an easy-to-use graphical\nuser interface, with point-and-click functionality. The control console application also provides several real-time displays, when in the ground mode. Data\nreceived from MARA is displayed as detector pulse height spectrum graph, coincident data x\xe2\x80\x93y scatter plot, and historical event count tracking.

Refer to MSC24042/38/41/228.\n\n9\n\nElectronics/Computers\nVLSI Design of a Turbo Decoder\nThe design is readily adaptable to diverse applications.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA very-large-scale-integrated-circuit\n(VLSI) turbo decoder has been designed to serve as a compact, highthroughput, low-power, lightweight decoder core of a receiver in a\ndata-communication system. In a typical\ncontemplated application, such a decoder core would be part of a single integrated circuit that would include the rest\nof the receiver circuitry and possibly\nsome or all of the transmitter circuitry,\nall designed and fabricated together according to an advanced communicationsystem-on-a-chip design concept.\nTurbo codes are forward-error-correction (FEC) codes. Relative to older FEC\ncodes, turbo codes enable communication at lower signal-to-noise ratios and\noffer greater coding gain (closer to the\nShannon theoretical limit). In addition,\nturbo codes can be implemented by relatively simple hardware. Therefore,\nturbo codes have been adopted as standard for some advanced broadband\ncommunication systems.\nIn general, a turbo encoder is equivalent to two convolutional encoders plus\na lookup table that stores interleaver addresses; a turbo decoder (see figure) includes a channel metric and parsing\nblock, two soft-input/soft-output (SISO)\ndecoders (denoted SISO1 and SISO2),\nand a random-access memory (RAM) for\ninterleaving/deinterleaving functions.\n\nThe received signal is first processed and\nparsed through the channel metric and\nparsing block, the output of which is a\nsequence of estimates that indicate how\nclosely each received bit is deemed to resemble a one or a zero. On the basis of\nthese estimates, SISO1 makes \xe2\x80\x9csoft\xe2\x80\x9d decisions: a soft decision is a statement of the\nprobability that each received bit is a one\nor a zero, based on the preceding sequence of bits.\nThe soft decisions made by SISO1 are\ninterleaved to be included in the input\nto SISO2, which then makes soft decisions based on both the estimates from\nthe channel metric and parsing block\nand the soft decisions from SISO1.\nThese soft decisions are again interleaved and sent as input to SISO1. Now,\nSISO1 has more information to use than\nit had on the previous iteration and it\nstrives to use the additional information\nto make a more accurate decision. The\niterative decoding process is repeated either a fixed number of times or until\nsome other criterion is satisfied. Then\nhard decisions are made on the basis of\nthe soft decisions. Intuitively, if the probability of a zero exceeds that of a one for\na given bit, then the hard decision will\nbe that a zero was transmitted.\nA description of the practical implementation of the above-described decoder architecture in terms of functional\n\nSISO1\nChannel Metric\nand\nParsing Block\n\nInterleavers\n\nInput\n\nSISO2\n\nOutput:\nHard Decision\n\nA Turbo Decoder engages in an iterative process in which incoming data are considered along with\nprior soft decisions in an effort to reach more accurate hard decisions concerning received bits.

It must suffice to summarize by reporting that some details of the\narchitecture of the implementation are\nespecially important for the overall design: The details in question include\nthose of the timing of memory reading\nand writing operations, a finite state machine in each SISO decoder, a module in\neach SISO decoder that performs forward and backward calculations, a module in each SISO decoder that performs\nthe soft-output calculations, and the interleaver/deinterleaver module.\nOverall, the design of the decoder is\nparamaterizable: that is, by adjusting the\nparameters of an otherwise generic design, one can modify the design to fit\ninto such communication-on-a-system\nproducts as transceivers in satellite communication systems, transceivers in wireless local-area networks, digital television\nreceivers, cable modems, digital video\nbroadcast receivers, and digital subscriber lines.

Heretofore, it has been the usual practice to use\neither of two other types of on-chip\ndelay-measuring circuits:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A delay chain of inverters is incorporated into the FPGA or ASIC chip\nalong with an input port for feeding\nthe inverter chain and an output port\nfor feeding a signal to off-chip measurement circuitry. The disadvantage\nof this design is that the measurement\nis inaccurate because it includes delays\nin buffers that are parts of the input\nand output ports.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The delay chain is arranged as a ring\noscillator. The disadvantage of this design is that the delay chain does not always oscillate as expected.\nThe improved design overcomes the\ndisadvantages of both older designs. In\nthe improved design, the delay chain\ndoes not include input and output\nbuffers and is not configured as an oscillator. Instead, the delay chain is made\npart of the signal chain of an on-chip\npulse generator. The duration of the\npulse is measured on-chip and taken to\nequal the delay.\nIn this design (see figure) the delay\nchain comprises six sub-chains denoted\nDC1 through DC6. Each sub-chain contains 500 lookup tables (LUTs), which\nare used as universal logic gates that implement the combinational logic in the\nFPGA or ASIC. The LUTs are programmed to act as either inverters or\nbuffers, depending on the position of a\nswitch on an external circuit board. The\noutput end of each sub-chain except the\nlast one is connected to the input end of\nthe next sub-chain; the output end of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\nGate\nPulse Generator Unit\nClock Signal\n50 MHz\n\n500 LUTs\n\n500 LUTs\n\n125 kHz\nMultiplexer\nDC1\n\nDC6\n\n1 Hz\nFrom DC2\n\nInverter Control\n\nFrom DC1\n\nDelay Length Control\n\n33 MHz\nClock\nSignals\n\n32 MHz\n\nPulse-Duration-Measuring\nUnit\n\nDisplay\nDriver\n\nDisplay\nUnit\n\nThe Delay Chain is part of an on-chip instrumentation system that generates pulses and measures their\nduration. Control and clock signals are generated by external circuitry.\n\neach subchain is also connected to one\nof six input terminals of a multiplexer.\nBy setting of switches in the multiplexer\ncontrolled by external circuitry, the\nlength of the delay chain can be set to\nany value between 500 and 3,000 LUTs\nin increments of 500 LUTs.\nAlso on the external board are two\ncrystal-controlled oscillators. One oscillator generates a clock signal at a nominal frequency of 50 MHz; the other generates a clock signal, at a nominal\nfrequency of 33 MHz, which is not synchronized with the 50-MHz signal. The\n50-MHz signal is used for the majority of\nthe FPGA logic. The 33-MHz signal is fed\nto an on-chip pulse-duration-measuring\nunit.\nThe on-chip delay-measuring circuitry\nincludes a pulse-generator unit,\nwherein the 50-MHz signal is divided in\nfrequency to generate two outputs: (1) a\n1-pulse-per-second clock signal that is\nfed to the on-chip pulse-duration-measuring unit and (2) a train of pulses, at\nfrequency of 125 kHz, that is fed as input\nto the delay chain.\nA gate that follows the multiplexer accepts inputs from both ends of the delay\n\nchain. In response, the gate generates a\n125-kHz train of pulses, the duration of\nwhich equals the delay. This pulse train\nis fed to the pulse-duration-measuring\nunit. The duration of the pulses in this\ntrain is what is measured. The complexity of the pulse-duration-measurement\nprocess is such that a complete description is not possible within the space\navailable for this article. It must suffice\nto summarize by saying that the process\ninvolves a combination of sampling the\n125-kHz pulses by use of the 33-MHz\nclock signals during a fixed period of 1\nsecond, counting the numbers of sampling periods during which the pulses\nare on, then averaging and displaying\nthe result.\nThis work was done by Yuan Chen, Gary\nBurke, and Douglas Sheldon of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A\nresource is defined as anything that\nneeds selecting such as compute resources, storage resources, and data resources. The user specifies the set of resource types desired, the constraints that\nmust hold over all the resources, and the\nranking function to be used to order the\nresources. For each request received,\nSurfer returns a set of resource tuples,\nwhere each tuple contains a resource instance for each resource type requested,\neach tuple satisfies the specified constraints, and tuples are ordered by descending values of the given ranking\nfunction. Constraints and ranking functions are Boolean and numeric expressions, respectively, using a set of built-in\narithmetic, Boolean and relational operators, and a set of functions supplied by\ninformation providers, which are implemented independently of the framework and integrated into the system\nusing a single configuration line.\nProviders supply functions of arbitrary\ntype that represent selected information\nsuch as the number of CPUs of a compute resource, free disk space of a storage resource, etc. Providers also supply\nqueries used to generate resource sets\nthat define the set of resources that are\nselectable. Information providers are invisible to the end user, who only sees the\nset of resource types selectable as well as\nthe set of functions available.

This accessible, online\nstructure is designed to support investigators by allowing them to make explicit, shared, and meaningful links\namong evidence, causal models, findings, and recommendations.\nThe semantic hypermedia component\nincludes a customizable ontology that\nspecifies various types of items such as\npeople, places, events, causes, systems,\nand associated information products relevant to mishap investigations. The ontology also describes the important\nproperties of each item, and details the\npotential relationships among items.\nItems stored in the repository are classified according to the ontology. Users\ncan set properties for stored items, and\n\ncan associate a relevant electronic file\nwith each one.

The simplification and miniaturization achieved\nby this invention are such that this\nmethod is suitable for use outside laboratories, in field settings in which space\nand power supplies may be limited.\nThis method is related to the methods\ndescribed in \xe2\x80\x9cSimplified Microarray\nTechnique for Identifying mRNA in\nRare Samples\xe2\x80\x9d (ARC-15177-1), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 31, No. 1 (January 2007),\npage 60. Like the methods described in\nthe cited prior article as well as older,\nmore complex methods, the present\nmethod is based partly on hybridization\nof nucleic acid, which is a powerful technique for detection of specific complementary nucleic acid sequences and is\nincreasingly being used for detection of\nchanges in gene expression in microarrays containing thousands of gene\nprobes. Like one of the methods described in the cited prior article, the\npresent method provides for identification of mRNA or DNA from whole cells.\nIn the present method, one begins by\npreparing one or more reference substance(s) and a reference slide that contains one or more compartment(s) \xe2\x80\x94\n\none compartment for each reference\nsubstance. Each reference substance includes a selected mRNA or DNA sequence labeled with horseradish peroxidase. [Preferably, the mRNA or DNA is\nprepared by polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) amplification.] Each reference\nsubstance is formulated to be solid at a\nlow storage temperature (about 4 \xc2\xb0C)\nand to become liquid at a higher temperature (no more than about 42 \xc2\xb0C).\nEach reference substance is placed in its\nassigned compartment on the slide, then\nthe slide is stored under refrigeration\nuntil it is used.\nOne also prepares a plate containing\none or more microwell(s). If there is\nmore than one microwell, then the microwells are arrayed in a pattern to register with the compartments containing\nthe reference substances on the slide.\nCells to be tested for the selected mRNA\nor DNA sequence(s) [more specifically,\ncells that contain substances that may or\nmay not include the selected mRNA or\nDNA sequence(s)] are prepared by making holes in their membranes large\nenough to enable molecules of the reference substances to enter. One or more\nof the cells is placed in each microwell.\nAt testing time, the reference slide is\nremoved from cold storage and placed\nin contact with the microwell plate, positioned so that the compartments containing the reference substances are reg-\n\nistered with the microwells containing\nthe cells. The plate-and-slide assembly is\nthen warmed to liquefy the reference\nsubstances so that they flow into the microwells and through the holes into the\ncells. The reference substance reacts\nwith substances in the cells, and the\nproducts of these reactions are then hybridized. If a cell contains a target substance (a substance that includes the selected mRNA or DNA), then the\nreference and target substances react to\nform reference-sequence/target-substance conjugate molecules. The reaction products are treated with a chemiluminescence solution, then illuminated\nwith light in a selected wavelength interval and subjected to a chemiluminescence scan. The presence or a sence of\nthe reference-sequence/target-substance\nconjugate molecules (and, hence, the\npresence or absence of the selected\nmRNA or DNA in the cells) is indicated\nby the presence or absence of corresponding chemiluminescence spots in the\nscan image.\nThis work was done by Eduardo Almeida\nof Ames Research Center and Geeta Kadambi\nof National Space Grant Foundation.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA process has been devised for making\nternary (specifically, CuInS2) nanocrystals\nfor use as quantum dots (QDs) in a contemplated next generation of high-efficiency solar photovoltaic cells. The\nprocess parameters can be chosen to tailor the sizes (and, thus, the absorption\nand emission spectra) of the QDs.\nThe process used heretofore to synthesize\nquantum dots in general involves in situ pyrolysis of reagents in the presence of a passivating solvent/ligand that not only serves as\na medium for the formation of the QDs via\npyrolysis, but also readily coordinates to the\nsurfaces of the QDs, thereby preventing further nucleation. The prevention of further\nnucleation, also known as capping, serves to\nregulate the size of the QDs.\nThe present process is simpler and involves less handling of toxic reagents.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nSpray chemical vapor deposition (spray\nCVD) processes of a special type have\nbeen investigated for use in making\nCuInS2 absorber layers of thin-film solar\nphotovoltaic cells from either of two subclasses of precursor compounds: [(PBu3)\n2Cu(SEt)2In(SEt)2] or [(PPh3)2Cu(SEt)2\nIn(SEt)2] {where Bu, Et, and Ph signify\nbutyl, ethyl, and phenyl groups, respectively}. CuInS2 is a member of the class of\nchalcopyrite semiconductors described in\nthe immediately preceding article.\n[(PBu3)2Cu(SEt)2In(SEt)2] and [(PPh3)2\nCu(SEt)2In(SEt)2] are members of the\nclass of single-source precursors also described in the preceding article.\nIn a spray CVD process of this type, a\nroom-temperature solution containing\nthe precursor compound is first ultrasonically nebulized. The resulting\naerosol is swept into a two-zone reactor\nby a flow of argon, which serves as a\nnonreactive carrier gas. In the reactor,\nthe aerosol first encounters the evaporation zone, which is a warm zone\nwherein the solvent and precursor\nevaporate. The resulting mixture of\ngases then enters the deposition zone,\nwhich is a hot zone wherein the precursor decomposes and the semiconductor film grows on a substrate as in conventional CVD.\nSpray CVD affords a combination of\nthe most desirable features (but without\n\n20\n\nthe major difficulties)\nof metalorganic CVD\nand spray pyrolysis.\nThese desirable features include growth\nof the film in an inert\natmosphere, capability\nfor deposition on a\nlarge area, laminar\nflow over the substrate,\nand storage and delivery of the precursor\nfrom a cool solution\nreservoir. The lastmentioned feature is\nespecially\nadvantageous in that it can\nprevent premature decomposition of a thermally labile precursor.\nTwo different spray\nCVD processes of this\ntype have been tested\nin experiments thus far.\nIn one process, a horizontal hot-wall reactor\nwas used; in the other\nprocess, a vertical coldwall reactor was used\n(see figure).

In the horizontal\nhot-wall reactor, the portion of the wall\nin the evaporation zone was heated to a\ntemperature of 130 \xc2\xb0C, while the portion\nof the wall in the deposition zone was\n\nheated to about 400 \xc2\xb0C. In the vertical\ncold-wall reactor, as its name suggests,\nthe wall was not heated; instead, the substrate was heated to 400 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe CuInS2 films produced in the experiments have been characterized by xray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy,\nand four-point-probe electrical tests. The\nresults of these tests have provided some\nguidance for refinement of the spray\nCVD processes and for annealing and\npossibly other post-process steps to im-\n\nprove the quality of the deposited\nCuInS2 films.\nThis work was done by Kulbinder K.\nBanger, Jerry Harris, Michael H.

The composition of\nthe glass in question in mole percentages is 35BaO + 15CaO + 5Al2O3 +\n10B2O3 + 35SiO2. The glass was formulated to have physical and chemical\nproperties suitable for use as a planarSOFC sealant, but has been found to be\ndeficient in one aspect: it is susceptible\nto cracking during thermal cycling of\nthe fuel cells. The goal in formulating\nthe glass/BNNT composite material was\nto (1) retain the physical and chemical\nadvantages that led to the prior selection of the barium calcium aluminosilicate glass as the sealant while (2) increasing\nstrength\nand\nfracture\ntoughness so as to reduce the tendency\ntoward cracking.\nIn preparation for tests, panels of the\nglass/BNNT composite were hot pressed\nand machined into test bars.

The rate of\ngrowth achievable in this process is about\nten times the rate achievable in older\nprocesses. Depending on the starting material and temperature-and-pressure schedule, this process can be made to yield diamond in any of a variety of scientifically\nand industrially useful forms, including\nmonocrystalline, polycrystalline, pure,\ndoped, and diamond composite. (Doping\nmakes it possible to impart desired electrical and optical properties, including semiconductivity and color.) The process can\nalso be used to make cubic boron nitride.\nThe difficulties of manufacturing diamond can be summarized as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Diamond can be made from dispersed\nphases of carbon (in which carbon atoms\nare surrounded by atoms of other ele-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\nments or compounds), but the rate of\ngrowth is low and the product is impure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Diamond crystals can be grown from\nmolten carbon at a high rate, but carbon\ndoes not melt at ambient pressure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In the range of temperature high\nenough for forming diamond at a high\nrate, diamond transforms into graphite if\nthe pressure is not high enough.\nThe apparatus includes a reaction cell\nwherein a controlled static pressure as\nhigh as 20 GPa and a controlled temperature as high as 5,000 \xc2\xb0C can be maintained. A precursor material that consists of either pure or doped diamond\npowder is placed in a graphite crucible\nthat, in turn, is placed in the reaction\ncell. The pressure in the cell is increased\nat ambient temperature, then the temperature is increased. Next, the cell is\ncooled, at a controlled rate, to a lower\ntemperature where carbon crystallizes.\nIf this controlled cooling is sufficiently\nslow, single-crystal diamond is formed;\nfaster cooling causes the formation of\n\npolycrystalline diamond. After crystallization, the reaction cell is cooled and\ndepressurized to room temperature and\npressure, the reaction cell is extracted\nfrom the apparatus, the graphite crucible is extracted from the reaction cell,\nthen the crucible is broken to extract\nthe bulk diamond.\nThe one major disadvantage of this\nprocess is that because of the difficulty\nof maintaining the combination of high\ntemperature and pressure, the apparatus and process are expensive and the\nvolume of the crucible must be limited.\nNevertheless, the process is scalable, and\nthe economic value of the tailored diamond products may justify the cost of\nscaling the apparatus up to larger production quantities.

The binding of\nthe antigens to the immobilized antibodies would change the index of refraction\nof the sensing volume, which would be\nmounted in one of the interferometer\narms. The interferometer would measure\nthe change in the index of refraction,\nthereby indirectly measuring the concen-\n\nZehnder interferometer, which affords\nonly a single pass of light through the\nsensing volume. In the ring resonator\nof the proposed system, light would\nmake multiple passes through the sensing volume, affording greater interaction length and, hence, greater antibody-detection sensitivity.\nIn one proposed ring-resonator/inter-\n\nferometer configuration, there would be\ntwo interferometer arms with coupled\noptical paths. One of the optical paths\nwould pass through the sensing volume;\nthe other optical path would not pass\nthrough the sensing volume (see figure). Interference between light beams\nin the two interferometer arms would be\ncharacterized by a phase difference proportional to the change in the index of\nrefraction of the sensing volume. The\nphase difference would result in a\nchange in the interferometer output intensity measured by use of a photodiode.\nA synchronous detector could be used to\nincrease sensitivity.\nThe ring resonator/interferometer\ncould be built by use of traditional bulk\noptical components or fabricated as a\nunit by standard silicon-fabrication\ntechniques. Inasmuch as a sol-gel precursor can be poured into a mold, an\netched recess in a planar waveguide or\nother structures could be used as the\nsensing volume.\nThis work was done by Gregory Bearman\nand David Cohen of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Water for dilution is gathered from\nthe cathode side of the fuel-cell stack. The\nfuel solution is recirculated, the fuel solution entering the anodes is monitored by\nuse of a methanol sensor, and, in response\nto the sensor reading, methanol is added\nto the solution as needed to maintain the\nrequired concentration. The collection of\nwater, the dilution of methanol, the control of concentration, and the circulation\nof the fuel solution entail the use of several pumps and control subsystems, and\nsubstantial electrical energy is consumed\nin operating the pumps and control subsystems. These auxiliary components and\nsubsystems typically contribute about half\nof the overall volume and mass and at\nleast half of the parasitic energy consumption of the system.\nThe figure schematically depicts the\ntransport processes involved in the operation of a direct methanol fuel cell\n(whether of prior or proposed design).\nMethanol is oxidized to protons and\ncarbon dioxide at the anode, and oxygen is reduced to water at the cathode.\nAs protons migrate from the anode to\nthe cathode through a proton-con-\n\n26\n\nducting mebrane that is part of a membrane/electrode assembly, water is\ntransported along with them by electro-osmotic drag: in other words, water\nmolecules associated with the protons\nare dragged along with the protons.\nAir flowing over the cathode evaporates some of the water. However, some\nof the water tends to diffuse back toward the anode because the concentration of water at the cathode exceeds\nthe concentration of water in the\nmethanol-water solution at the anode\n(this diffusion is hereafter denoted\n\xe2\x80\x9cback diffusion\xe2\x80\x9d). Water is consumed\nat the anode by the oxidation of\nmethanol, and water is produced at the\ncathode by reduction of oxygen.\nThe rate of consumption of water at\nthe anode is proportional to the electriccurrent density. The rate of electro-osmotic drag of water from the anode to\nthe cathode is determined by the electric-current density and a drag coefficient that amounts to about 3 molecules\nof water per proton. The rate of production of water in the chemical reaction at\nthe cathode is also proportional to the\nelectric-current density. The rate of flow\nof air over the cathode, the temperature\nof the cell, and the absolute humidity of\n\nthe air at that temperature determine\nthe rate of evaporation. The gradient of\nconcentration of water between the\nanode and the cathode and the diffusion\ncoefficient\nof\nwater\nin\nthe\nmembrane/electrode composite determine the rate of back diffusion.\nIn a fuel cell of prior design, the rate\nof back diffusion is insufficient, necessitating the use of pumps to return water\nfrom the cathode to the anode side. The\nproposed fuel-cell design concept provides for enhancement of the rate of\nback diffusion through enhancement of\nthe gradient of concentration of water\nbetween the anode and the cathode,\nthereby eliminating the need for the\npumps and controls heretofore needed\nfor this purpose.\nThe enhancement of the gradient of\nconcentration of water would be effected,\nnearly independently of the electric-current density, through appropriate choice\nof the concentration of methanol, the\nporosity of the electrodes, the thickness\nof the membrane, the operating temperature, and the stoichiometric rate of flow\nof air. For any given set of values of these\nparameters, there would be an electriccurrent density at which water balance\nwould be achieved. Therefore, a membrane/electrode assembly capable of supporting any desired value of electric-current density and maintaining water\nbalance could be designed for use in a\nfuel cell without need for pumps or other\ncomponents for dilution or for redistribution of water.\nAn important consideration in the design concept is that an uncontrolled excess of neat methanol at the anode\nwould cause swelling of the membrane.\nTherefore, the rate of delivery of\nmethanol must be such that only a small\nquantity of methanol reaches the anode\nand that the entire quantity of delivered\nmethanol be utilized within the anode,\nso that no appreciable quantity of neat\nmethanol can reach the surface of the\nmembrane. The full utilization of\nmethanol could be achieved if the anode\nstructure were made sufficiently porous\nand thick: such a structure would ensure\nthat the residence time for methanol was\nadequate for complete consumption of\nethanol within the anode structure. The\nporous anode structure would contain\nenough proton-conducting polymer material to form conducting paths for protons and water molecules, yet would\nhave enough tortuosity to afford sufficient residence time. The anode structure would include layers having various\nproton-conducting-polymer contents so\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\nthat the desired level of utilization could\nbe achieved. The design choice of thickness and porosity of the anode would depend on the planned rate of delivery of\nmethanol and on whether the methanol\nwere to be delivered directly in purely\nliquid form, delivered directly in aerosol\nform, or delivered in purely liquid form\nthrough a diffusion barrier.\nThe design must provide for removal\nof excess heat. In a fuel cell of prior design, one can utilize the circulation of\nthe dilute fuel solution to remove heat\non the anode side and evaporative cool-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\ning on the cathode side. In the absence\nof fuel-solution circulation in the proposed design and without further modification, only evaporative cooling would\nbe available. Under most conditions,\nevaporative cooling alone may not suffice, so that it may be necessary to add\ncooling fins to the fuel-cell stack.\nThis work was done by Sekharipuram\nNarayanan, Andrew Kindler, and Thomas\nValdez of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA control architecture and algorithms\nto implement the architecture have\nbeen conceived to enable a robot to\nlearn from its experiences and to combine knowledge gained from prior experiences in such a way as to be able to\nsolve new problems. The architecture is\nan abstraction of an interacting system\nof relatively simple components that,\nwhen properly interconnected, should\nenable the spontaneous emergence of\nbehaviors from the complete system that\nwould not necessarily be expected from\nthe individual components. These emergent behaviors should enable a robot to\ninteract robustly and intelligently with a\ncomplex, dynamic environment.\nDeparting from the customary approach to artificial intelligence, the theoretical foundation of this architecture\nincludes a hypothesis that has gained\nsome acceptance in research on natural\nintelligence in animals. Stated succinctly, the hypothesis is that intelligence requires embodiment, situatedness, development, and interaction.\nApplied to a computer, the hypothesis\nstates that to be able to develop intelligence, a computer must be able to,\namong other things, manipulate the environment and sense the results; in\nother words, the computer must be\nequipped with a robotic interface with\nthe physical world. A related hypothesis\nis that sensory-motor coordination\nforms the basis for intelligent behavior,\nand, hence, intelligence. This follows\nfrom the demonstrated ability of sensory-motor coordination information to\nself-organize into categories.\nThe architecture represents a set of\nparallel distributed computational modules (software objects) that communicate with each other through message\npassing. The principal objects loosely\ncorrespond to the (presumed) common\ncomputational modules of mammalian\nbrains. A set of sensory processing modules continually updates a spatio-temporally indexed short-term memory structure denoted the sensory ego-sphere\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\n(SES). Depending on the task context,\nan attentional mechanism determines\nthe saliency of incoming sensory information. In response to changes in the\nstate of motion of the robot, the time series of sensory information is partitioned\ninto episodes. Episodes are encoded in\nvector form and stored in a database, denoted the database associative memory\n(DBAM), that comprises the long-term\nmemory of the robot.\nThe DBAM has the implicit mathematical structure of a linear vector\nspace that is constructed as the direct\nsum of three subspaces. One subspace\nencodes a change in motor state (a\nmotor event). Another subspace encodes the state of the sensors immediately prior to the motor event \xe2\x80\x94 in\nother words, the sensory preconditions\nof the motor event. The third subspace\nencodes the sensory state subsequent to\nthe motor event (sensory post-conditions). The vectors in the DBAM and\nthe external events from which they are\nformed are called sensory-motor coordination (SMC) events.\nSeveral research projects have demonstrated that over time, as a robot senses\nand acts, clusters form within a vector\nspace of SMC descriptors. Categories\nemerge. Thus, it becomes possible to select an exemplar that describes an equivalence class of SMC events. The encoding of SMC events as motor events with\nsensory preconditions and sensory postconditions makes it possible to use simple vector-space distances as measures of\ndissimilarity or similarity of complete\nSMC events. Vector-space distances can\nalso serve as measures of dissimilarity or\nsimilarity between the sensory post-conditions of one event and the sensory preconditions of another.\nThe architecture utilizes a control\nstrategy, called topological action mapping, that appears to be employed by\nmammals to achieve specific goals. In\nthis architecture, action maps are implemented by a spreading activation network (SAN). (A SAN is one of a particu-\n\nlar class of graph traversal algorithms\nthat selects optimal paths.) For each goal\nto be reached by the robot, there corresponds an SMC event. Moreover, the current state of the robot is indicated by an\nSMC event. Given the goal event, the\nSAN searches through the DBAM,\nmatching its sensory preconditions to\nthe sensory post-conditions of other\nevents. The search is constrained by a\nnumber of global state variables and previously formed linkages. Upon finding a\nsufficiently close match, the SAN iterates\nthe search until the current state is\nreached. The current motor state\n(hence, the current behavior) is maintained until the sensory post-conditions\ntrigger a change of state. Thus, the robot\nproceeds through a sequence of behaviors until the goal is reached.\nOne key aspect of this architecture is\nthat the robot cannot be programmed\nthrough conventional means: it must\nbe taught to perform tasks, either\nthrough direct control or by example.\nThe robot must practice each task several times to enable the formation of\nclusters of SMC events and to learn the\nsequences of these events. Such repetition enables the robot to perform the\ntask later, without supervision. However, this does not, in itself, enable creative problem solving.\nTo be able to solve problems creatively, the robot must engage in a\nprocess analogous to dreaming. After intervals of continuous motor activity, the\nrobot performs computations in which it\nplays back data on recently performed\nsequences of tasks. SMC events are compared quasi-randomly to other events in\nthe DBAM. If the sensory post-conditions of a given event are sufficiently similar to the sensory precondition of another event, links are formed between\nthem. Such a link is formed, even if the\ntwo behaviors have never occurred in sequence before. This link gives the robot\na new possible behavior transition that it\ncould make, given the appropriate sensory trigger. Thus, the robot learns to an-\n\n29\n\nticipate possible sequences of events and\nlearns strategies for the solving of problems that it has not encountered but\nthat could occur.\nThe architecture is still undergoing\ndevelopment. An SES has been implemented in the NASA Robonaut (a developmental anthropomorphic robot\nintended to serve as an astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s assistant). Production-quality software\nto implement the architecture has not\n\nyet been written. A major problem in\nwriting this software is that of efficient\nrepresentation of sensory data in vector spaces.\nThis work was done by Alan Peters of\nVanderbilt University for Johnson Space\nCenter.\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

By incorporating\nprognostic capabilities along with advanced diagnostic capabilities, these developments hold promise to increase the\nsafety and affordability of the affected\nengineering systems by making it possible to obtain timely and accurate information on the statuses of the systems\nand predicting impending failures well\nin advance.\nPrognosis is tightly coupled with diagnosis. The simplest approach to prognosis by an artificial-intelligence system involves the use of a diagnostic engine in a\ncontrolled feedback loop to project\nfrom the current state of the affected engineering system to future states that are\nelements of scenarios that are discovered hypothetically. A hypothetical-scenario generator is a key element of this\n\n30\n\napproach. A hypothetical-scenario generator accepts, as its input, information\non the current state of the engineering\nsystem. Then, by means of model-based\nreasoning techniques, it returns a disjunctive list of fault scenarios that could\nbe reached from the current state.\nThe HSG is a specific instance of a hypothetical-scenario generator that implements an innovative approach for\nperforming diagnostic reasoning when\ndata are missing. The special purpose\nserved by the HSG is to (1) look for all\npossible ways in which the present state\nof the engineering system can be\nmapped with respect to a given model\nand (2) generate a prioritized set of future possible states and the scenarios of\nwhich they are parts. The HSG models a\npotential fault scenario as an ordered\ndisjunctive tree of conjunctive consequences, wherein the ordering is based\nupon the likelihood that a particular\nconjunctive path will be taken for the\ngiven set of inputs. The computation of\nlikelihood is based partly on a numerical\nranking of the degree of completeness\n\nof data with respect to satisfaction of the\nantecedent conditions of prognostic\nrules. The results from the HSG are then\nused by a model-based artificial-intelligence subsystem to predict realistic scenarios and states.\nTo avoid the need to create special\nmodels to generate hypothetical scenarios, the HSG uses the same model that is\nused to perform fault-detection and\nother diagnostic functions but interprets\nthe results generated by the model in a\nmanner unique to the generation of hypothetical scenarios. An important additional advantage of this approach is that\na future state can be diagnosed by the\nsame model as that used to diagnose the\ncurrent state.\nThis work was done by Mark James of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.

The\nbasic concept of the SDNITS is similar to\nthat of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Tracking Data Relay\nSatellite System (TDRSS). However, the\nSDNITS would satisfy the needs of the\nnext generation of Earth-observing satellite missions, including, notably, the\nneed to relay data at much higher rates\n\xe2\x80\x94 of the order of 10 Gb/s versus \xe2\x89\xa4400\nMb/s for the TDRSS.\nThe document characterizes the problem of designing the telecommunication architecture of the SDNITS as consisting of two main parts: (1) finding the\nmost advantageous orbit for the SDNITS\nto gather data from the scientific satellites and relay the data to the ground,\ntaking account of such factors as visibility and range; and (2) choosing a\ntelecommunication architecture appropriate for the intended relay function.\nThe design of the SDNITS would incorporate technological advances \xe2\x80\x94 especially in the field of high-rate data transmission \xe2\x80\x94 that have occurred during\nthe three decades since the TDRSS was\ndesigned.\nThis work was done by Faiza Lansing and\nAnil Kantak of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The algorithms were developed\nfollowing a model-predictive-control approach along with a convexification of\nthe governing dynamical equations, control constraints, and trajectory and state\nconstraints. The open-loop guidance\nproblem is solved in advance or in real\ntime by use of the pseudo-waypoint generation (PWG) method, which is a blend\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2007\n\nof classical waypoint and state-of-theart, real-time trajectory-generation methods. The PWG method includes satisfaction of required thruster silent times\nduring maneuvers. Feedback control is\nimplemented to track PWG trajectories\nin a manner that guarantees the resolvability of the open-loop-control problem,\nenabling updating of G&C in a provably\nrobust, model-predictive manner. Thruster\nfiring times and models of the gravitational field of the body are incorporated\ninto discretized versions of the dynamical\nequations that are solved as part of an optimal-control problem to minimize consumption of fuel or energy. The optimalcontrol problem is cast as a linear matrix\ninequality (specifically a second-order\ncone program), then solved through semidefinite-programming techniques in a\ncomputationally efficient manner that\nguarantees convergence and satisfaction\nof constraints.\nThis work was done by Ahmet A\xc3\xa7ikme\xc5\x9fe and\nJohn M.

To recapitulate: A\nmethodology for controlling a herd of cooperative and autonomous mobile robots\nexploring the surface of a remote planet\nor moon (specifically, Titan or Titan-like)\nis undergoing development. The proposed configuration of mobile robots\nconsists of a blimp and a herd of surface\nsondes. The blimp is the leader of the\nherd, and it commands the other robots\nto move to locations on the surface or\nbelow the surface to conduct science operations. Once a target is chosen, the sondes\ncooperatively aim sensors at the target to\nmaximize scientific return. This hierarchical and cooperative behavior is necessary\nin the face of such unpredictable factors\nas terrain obstacles and uncertainties in\n\nSimulation and Testing of\nManeuvering of a Planetary\nRover\nA report discusses the development\nof a computational model of a Mars Explorer Rover maneuvering across terrain under varying conditions.
