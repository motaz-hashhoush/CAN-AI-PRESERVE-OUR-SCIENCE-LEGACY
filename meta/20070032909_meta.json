In this paper we integrate several indicators that are available to enhance the information for preparation for and responses to food security emergencies. The assessment uses a price model based on the relationship between the suitability of the growing season and market prices for coarse grain. The model is then used to create spatially continuous maps of millet prices. The model is applied to the dry central and northern areas of West Africa, using satellite-derived vegetation indices for the entire region. By coupling the model with vegetation data estimated for one to four months into the future, maps are created of a leading indicator of potential price movements. It is anticipated that these maps can be used to enable early warning of famine and for planning appropriate responses.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070032909, "id": "1c7ec418a9af4f7fad5e546c227d87dd", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070032909.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070032909/downloads/20070032909.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070032909/downloads/20070032909.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070032909/downloads/20070032909.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
