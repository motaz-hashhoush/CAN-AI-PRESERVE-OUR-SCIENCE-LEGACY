Water markets constitute a regionally applicable non-structural measure to counter water scarcity that has received the attention of academics and policy-makers, but there is no global view on their applicability. We present the global distribution of potential nations and states where water markets could be instituted in a legal sense, by investigating 296 water laws internationally, with special reference to a minimum set of key rules: legalization of water reallocation, the separation of water rights and landownership, and the modification of the cancellation rule for non-use. We also suggest two additional globally distributed prerequisites and policy implications: the predictability of the available water before irrigation periods and public control of groundwater pumping throughout its jurisdiction.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "13", "submissionId": 20180004836, "issue": "3", "issn": "1748-9326", "publisher": "IOP Science", "eissn": "1748-9326", "id": "9047b883bf99440086cd7e4f95d87f47", "publicationName": "Environmental Research Letters", "publicationDate": "2018-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
