Uncertainty in the control design models typically require a very robust, low performance control design which must be tuned on-orbit to achieve the required performance. A new procedure for refining a multivariable open loop plant model based on closed-loop response data is presented. Using a minimal representation of the state space dynamics, a least squares prediction error method is employed to estimate the plant parameters. This control-relevant system identification procedure stresses the joint nature of the system identification and control design problem by seeking to obtain a model that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual closed-loop performance. This paper presents an algorithm for iterative closed-loop system identification and controller redesign along with illustrative examples.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19980219467, "endDate": "1998-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "meetingId": "a44cfdac738f40eb90920badf39d4d20", "id": "2627ca136f904ab9808392e3a0154bc8"}], "name": "Aerospace Conference", "location": "Snowmass, CO", "id": "a44cfdac738f40eb90920badf39d4d20", "startDate": "1998-03-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980219467, "id": "60b291427fd64e8cb3b4e052f70aec29", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980219467.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980219467/downloads/19980219467.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980219467/downloads/19980219467.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980219467/downloads/19980219467.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
