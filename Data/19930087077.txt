Attitude of Zuronean Governments. -\n\nAll the principal\n\ncountries of Europe recognize commercial aeronautics as an indispensable factor in the national defense.\n\nIn spite of serious\n\nfinancial stringency es the Governments of England, F~ance,\nSwitzerland, Hungary, Roumania, Poland, Ge$many, Holland, Eelgi\xe2\x80\x93\nurn, Denmark and others are contributing liberally to the support\n,1=\n~\n\nand encouragement of commercial air lines.\n2. Character of direct subsidies .-\n\nGovernment aid in gen\xe2\x80\x93\n\ncral is of two forms: direct and indirect.

Extent of aair routes.-\n\nAS a result of Government and\n\nmunicipal aid\xe2\x80\x9da comprehensive net of air lines is in operation\nover the continent; there are nine services daily from London\nacross the Channel (by Englishj French, Dutch and German coinpanies); one may travel by air direct from London to Constanti-no-\n\nI\n\n3\n\nN.A.C.A.

Educational effect of air li-nes.\n-\n\nThe widespread and\n\nconstantly increasing public and Government interest in Europe\nin commercial aeronautics reflects t\xe2\x80\x99he importance everywhere\naccredited to aviation and to the development of an adequate\naeronautical\n\nreserve.\n\nThe European public appears much more\n\nawake to the significance of aviation, both as an element of\nnational defense and as a transportation agent, than does the\nAmerican public.\n\nThis may result in part from the political\n\nmap of Europe and from the fact that the lessons of the War\nwere brought more vividly home to them; but it is also in no\nsmall measure due to the educational effect of the continued\n\nIi-\n\n..\n\n.. . .......\n\n. ... .... . . ..\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nIT. .C.A.
