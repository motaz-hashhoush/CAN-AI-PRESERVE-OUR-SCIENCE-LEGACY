Manned Spacecraft\nCenter,\nNational Aeronautics\nand Space Administration,\nHouston, Texas.\nAlthough a specific mission and a specific computer subsystem\nwere used as models for the\nstudy, the individual investigations\nwere conceptual in nature rather\nthan attempts to apply existing equipment or techniques.\nE:tch concept\nwas investigated\nto the level required to provide a satisfactory\ndegree\nof confidence in the feasibility\nof applying that concept to the specified\nmission.\n\n1.1\n\nScope\nThe study consisted\nof an investigation\nof the application of the\nSaturn V computer and a redundant version of the Apollo backup data\nadapter as a means of meeting the reliability\nand mission requirements\nof a 90-day Earth Polar Orbit (EPO) Apollo Extension System (AES)\nmission.\nP:_ckaging; reliability; fault detection and isolation; inflight\nmaintenance in high humidaty, zero gravity environments;\noptimum\nsparing level; module and channel switching; and other pertinent items\nwere studied in an attempt to determine the required redesign of the\nsubject computer and data adapter subsystem to enable it to meet the\nguidance and control functional requirements\nand reliability\napportionment of a typical 90-day AES-EPOmission.\nLimited fabrication\ndemonstrating\nan approach to sparing in a high humidity, zero gravity\nenvironment was also required.\n\n1.2\n\nObjective\nThe objective of this study was to investigate\npossible solutions\nto long-term and time-critical\nreliability problems as they affect the\nApollo Command Module guidance and control computer and its applications to AES missions.\nSpecifically,\nthe Saturn V Triple Modular\nRedundant (TMR) computer and a redundant version of the Apollo\nbackup data adapter were investigated\nas a means of solving the time\ncritical reliability\nproblem\xc2\xb0\nA detailed investigation\nof in/light maiiitenance or module and channel switching of the computer and data\nadapter were investigated as a means of solving the long term reliability problem.\n\n1.3\n\nApproach\nThe Saturn V computer and a redundant version of the Apollo\nbackup data adapter were examined to determine\nhow their packaging,\nreliability\nand machine organization\ncould be improved to meet the\nrequirements\nof extended Apollo missions.\nSeveral concepts and aN\nternate techniques were investigated\nas solutions for each of the "problem areas" uncovered\nby examination\nof this basic computer\nsystem.\nA reconfigured\nsubsystem\nwas derived by selecting the best solution\nfor each problem area.\n\n2.0\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nThe investigation\nperformed under this coutract was directed\ntoward making the subject computer and data adapter subsystem\ncapable of meeting AES requirements.\nThe principle inputs were\nmission profile,\nreliability\napportionment,\nand Block II ApoI_o Guidance and Control Computer requirements.\nTo avoid duplication\nof\neffort between this study and contract NAS 9-3724 (Apollo Backup\nStudy), a rigorous\nverification\nthat the AES configuration\nwill meet\nthe Block II Apollo functional requirements\nwas deferred to the backup\ncomputer study.\nCare was taken, however,\nto assure that the memory capacity of the AES computer was sufficient for the mission and\nthat the computation\nspeed was faster than the Block II Apollo cowputer.\n\n2.1\n\nMission\n\nProfile\n\nA 90-day earth polar orbit mission profile was considered\nfor\nevaluating\nsystem requirements\nnecessary\nto meet the apportioned\nreliability.\nThe profile was divided for the purpose of analysis into\nfour prim_wy phases:\nlaunch, polar orbit injection,\norbit adjustment,\nand re-entry.\nThe profile for boost and orbit injection is shown in\nFigure 1, and the profile for deboost and re-entry\nis shown in Figure\n2.\n\nThe primary function of the AES computer dur_mg boost is to\nmonitor the guidance and control of the Saturn vehicle.\nGuidance\nduring the entire S-IC stage burn period is in accordance\nwith a predeterL_ined time-tilt\nprogram.\nAn iterative\nguidance mode (path\nadaptive guidance) is used for the S-If and S-IVB powered flight phases.\nCutoff of the S-IC and S-If stages occurs when the fuel is depleted to a\npredetermined\nlevel, while cutoff of the S-IVB occurs when the velocity for orbital injection is attained,\nThe functions which must be\nmonitored _nd the parameters\nwhich must be computed by the AES\nsubsystem\nduring boost include:\n1)\n\nNavigation monitoring--determine\nvelocity

primary function of the AES computer during orbit injection\n(transfer from 100-mile parking orbit to 200-mile\nEPO) is also to\nmonitor the guidance and control of the vehicle.\nThe AES

are:\n1)\n\nS-IVB burn --0. 110 hours,\n\n?_\n\nSM burn -- 6. 040 hours.\n\nThe AES computer subsystem\nis required to control vehicle\nattitude during orbital operations.\nThe required attitude deadband is\n+0.50 degrees (all axes) and the allowable drift rates are \xc2\xb10. 02 degrees per second (about zero for two axes and about the orbital rate\nfor the third axis).\nPowered phases for orbit maintenance\nare not\nconsidered\ncritical for the purposes of this ,_tudy.\nGuidance and control of the command module (CM) and service\nmodule (SM) are required of the AES computer suL :ystem during reentry.\nThis function was examined in detail under contract N2_S\n9-3724 (the Apollo Backup Study) and the results were factored into\nTask C (machine organization tradeoffs).\nThe event

noncritical\nphases of the mission occur during orbit and axe\nused as the baseline reference\nfor the environmental\nstresses\nwith a\nseverity factor of unity.\nThe critical phases occur during powered\nflight and include launch, polar orbit injection,\noruit adjustment,\nand\nre-entry.\n\n"\n\nThe latmch phase is composed of three subphases with varying\nenvironmentai\nstresses\nas shown in Table 2. Launch is initiated by\nthe Saturn-IC booster,\nwhich causes the greatest\nstress to the equipmerit - 75 times that imposed by orbital envirunmental\nconditions.\nThis subphase is followed by the Saturn-II stage burn which imposes\n50 times the baseline stress,\nwhich is in turn followed by the Saturn!V_Bphase with a 35 times stress factor.\n\n6\n\nTABLE\n,\n\n2 -- Launch Stress\n\nFactors\n\nL\n\nSubphase\n\nTime\n(T) (hrs)\n\nK Factor\n\nT \xc3\x97 K\n\nSaturn-IC\n\n9. 042\n\n75\n\n3.15\n\nSaturn-II\n\n0.

in\nTable 2 by multiplying\nthe actual time that each subphase exists by\nthe corresponding\nstress factor.\nThe effective stress factor for the\nentire launch phase is then calculated\nby dividing the sum of the effective time periods by the sum of the actual time periods.\nDuring polar orbit injection,\nthrust is applied to the vehicle by\nreignition\nof the Saturn-IYB stage.\nThe stress factor of 35 is applied\nfor the 0. 11 hours of burn time.\nThrust for orbit adjustment\nis provided by the service module engine after jettison of the Saturn-IVB\nstage, and a factor of 25 is applied for 0.04 hours.\nThe 1.5 hours of critical mission phase designated\nas re-entry\nactually includes the time in orbit required to prepare for the re-entry\nmaneuver.\nIt is assumed that the re-entry\nmaneuver\nwill take a maximum of 35 minutes so the orbital factor of 1.0 will be applied for 55\nminutes of the 1.5 hours.\nThe re-entry\nmaneuver\nalso consists\nof two\nsubphases,\ndeboost and re-entry.\nDeboost is accomplished\nby reignition of the service module engine.\nRe-entry\nstresses\nare imposed\nby the acceleration\nand aerodynamic\nforces caused by the spacecraft\nentering the earth\'s\natmosphere.\nA composite\nre-entry\nfactor is\ndeveloped in Table 3 which summarizes\nthe severity factors for each\ncritical mission phase.\n\n7\n\nTABLE\n\n3 --

is imposed.\nThe "most critical phase" was found to be\nlaunch, si,,ce it produced the largest effective time of 10.8 hours.\nLaunch was therefore\nchosen as the phase upon which the computed\nshort

aUowed during these periods.\nRepair was allowed, however, during noncritical\nmission _hases.\nReliability\ncalculations\nwere based on duty cycl: s of 25, 50, and\n100 i_ercent of the noncritical\nphase time combined with the 1.85 hours\nof the critical phase ti:ne.\nReliability\nwas calculated\non the "o_,,,,,._\n_ -\'_,,.\nboth a zero failure tale as well as a non-zero failure

Upon removing the unit cover to replace a failed module, the\nentire interior\nof the unit is exposed to the spacecraft\nenvironment.\nWhen the cover is replaced\nafter repair,\nthe free moisture\nand contaminants\ntrapped in the unit must be purged and the unit repressurized\nto somewhat greater than cabin pressure\nwith dry gas.\n\n:\n\nIn the second and third approaches an attempt was made to\nlimit the degree of exposure during a maintenance\naction by sealing\nvarious portions of the computer independently.\nSince a TMR computer consists of essentially\nthree individual computers,\neach channel\ncan be sealed individually so that only a third of the computer is exposed each time a repair is attempted.\nIn the Saturn V computer, the\ncasting is designed such that each logic channel is partitioned into\neffectively five physical cells.\nIf each cell is separately sealed, then\na fifteenth or less of the computer is exposed each time a repair is\nattempted.\n\n:\n:\n_\n\nIn each case the covers woulcl be sealed by means of modified\n0-rings and the exposed volume purged and repressurized\nwith dry\ngas to an overpressure\nof two or three psi.\nGasket-sealed\nunits have\nbeen designed at IBM to provide leakage rates as low as 10-7 cubic\ncentimeters\nper second per inch of linear seal length.\n\n;._\n\n_\n\n13\n\nTr_deoffs between the three sealing approaches\nwere made on\nthe basis of leakage rates,\nexpected repair intervals,\nmodule replaceability,\nand design complexity.\nAlthough each method possessed\ncertain advantages\never the other two, the cell-sealing\napproach was\nselected primarily\nbecause it provided minimum circuit exposure over\nthe 90-day mission and because it provided easiest access to a failed\nmodule, but at a cost in size, weight, and probably cost of fabrication.\n\n,\n\nClosed loop systems were considered\nbut not emphasized\nin the\nstudy.\nA pressurized\nsystem which circulates\ndehumidified\nair\nthrough the computer and contains filters for chemical contaminants\nhas, at least, history in aircraft\napplications.\nThe use of freon in a\nclosed loop or even static system offers several advantages\nincluding\nmoisture-repellent\ncharacteristics.\nNo matter what packaging approach is selected for application\nin an adverse environment,\nthe problem of sealing the connectors\nremains a problem.\nAlthough the connectors\nassociated\nwith the\npluggable mod.Aes are partially protected\nin any of the approaches\ndescribed\nabove, the cable connectors\nwhich connect the computer\nsystem with other systems remain exposed to the spacecraft\nenvironment.\nStudy emphasis\nwas therefore\ngiven to connector\nsealing technique s.\nExploratory\ntesting of various sealing techniques\nindicated that\na combination\nof gasket sealing and silicone gel loading of the connectors appeared to solve the com_ector sealing problem.\nThe test\nresults were so successful,\nin fact, that the packaging approach\nselected for the AES computer system eliminated\nsealing of the replaceable modular area as shown in Figure 3. Each replaceable\nmodule\nis sealed individually\nand chassis sealing is limited to unreplaceable\nitems such as back panels and interconnecting\nwiring.\n\n"_\n\nIn the exploratory\ntests of various cormector-sealing\ntechniques,\na male and female Saturn V page connector\nwere wired and sealed\nwith epoxy on their rear surfaces\nas shown in Figure 4. A silicone\nrubber gasket was glued to the face of the female connector with DowCorning Ag-4000.\nThe female cap was removed and DC-3 silicone\ngrease packed inside the connector.\nThe pins of the male connector\nwere also saturated\nwith DC-2 silicone grease.\nContact measurements (made with 40 contacts connected in series) before and after\napplication of silicone grease indicated that the grease had no measurable effects on the contact resistance\nbetween male and female connections.\nLeakage resistance\nchecks between adjacent pins showed no\nappreciable\nchange in megger readings even when disconnected\no.-_.d\nreconnected\nwhile immersed\nin a bath of sait water.\n\n14\n\n_oxy\n\nGonnector\nGasket\n\nScrews\nCap\n\nGasket\n\nConncctor\n\nEpoxy\n\n\'Cable\n\nFigure\n\n4.\n\nExploratory\n\n16\n\nTest\n\nModel\n\nAlthough individual sealing of the replaceable modu:es and application of the above connector-seahng\ntechnique would seem to solve the\npackaging problem for operation and maintenance in the adverse AF3\nenvironment, a detailed data analysis of test results on contact materials was performed to assure that the properties of the contact materials\nwouL\' not present a problem in the AES application.\nThis analysis resulted in the recommendation\nof gold-on-nickle as the contact material,\nas in the Saturn V connectors, but with the thickness of the gold platit,_\nincreased from about 50 mils to 200 mils. If the increased plating\nthickness and stringent quality control methods prove to be inadequate\nin controlling plating porosity, a technique for welding gold foil on base\ncontact materials has been proven feasible at IBM but not as yet used\nbecause of the higher fabricaL_on costs involved. Although the recommended process will result in expensive connectors,\ntheir performance\nin the adverse AES environment seems assured and worth the cost.\n\n3.2\n\nMachineOrganization\nThe Saturn" computer and a redundant version of the Apollo\nbackup data adaptt," were used as a basic system for the machine organization studies.\nThis basic computer system was analyzed fur its\nreliability,\nerror detection, failure isolation, and performance capabilities and changes to the machine organization made to improve the\nweak areas uncovered by the analysis.\nSimulation oi _,te reliability model for the basic .3ystem revealed\ntha* neither the time critical nor long term reliabilities were met by the\nbasic system without sparing, as indicated in Table 6. In order to imFrove system reliability (especially in the critical mission phases), the\nsimplex computer oscillator and tim duplex memories and the duplex\npov,er supplies were triplicated.\nA novel oscillator configuration was\ndesigned in which three unsynchronized oscillators operate in parallel\nand are selectively gated into the system according to error detector\nindications.\nTMR memories provide a reliability increase by forcing\nerror-causing\ndisagreements\nfrom the word level of the duplex configura\'_mn to the bit level of TMR voting. Triplex power supplies with\noverlapping duplex distribution nets were selected as the power system\nfor the reorganized computer system.\nTwo machine organization areas which were investigated with the\npurpose of improving system reliability but which were not factored\ninto the reliability computations were grounding and transiec _,protection. The grounding scheme of the Satuln V system was retained in\ngeneral but revised in detail to reduce interaction of ground _urrents,\n\n17\n\nI\nI\n\n1\n\nTable\n\nElement\n\n6 -- Reliability\n\nCritical\nPhase\n\nEstimates\n\nNon-op\n\n50%\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2l\n\ni\n]\n4\n\nComputer\nOscillator\n\nData Adapter\nP_wer Supply\n\nComputer\n\n\'\n\nNon-op\n\nk =0\n\n25%\n\n50%\n\n25%\n\n0.9647\n0.9992\n0. 9809\n\n0.9886\n0.9996\n0. 9947\n\n0.9843\n\n0.9943\n\nSystem\n\n0.999933\n0.999992\n\n0.8879\n0.9984\n\n0.9272\n0.9989\n\n0.9446\n0.9992\n\n0.999998\n0.999942\n\n0.9334\n0.9528\n\n0.9580\n0.9689\n\n0.9686\n0.9760\n\n0.999989\n0.999995\n\n0.8096\n0.9980\n\n0.8921\n0.9988\n\n0.9272\n0.9992\n\n0.9429\n0.9992\n\n0.9840\n0.9997\n\n! 0.999994\n\nLogic\nMemory\n\n._ogic\nJ\n\nk> 0\n.....\n\n100%\n\nj\nI\n|\n\n(Basic System)\nMission Reliability\n\n0.8113\n\n0.8932\n\n0.9280\n\n0.9436\n\n0.9843\n\n0.999921\n\n0.7189\n\n0.8272\n\n0.8759\n\n0.9096\n\n0.9728\n\nespecially\nat the module interfaces\nand in the memory modules.\nIsolated ground planes were provided for the memory modules,\nsince\nthese are the most noise-critical\nelements\nin the computer\nsystem, but\nof differat the cost of transformer-coupled\ndrive circuits and addition\nential amplifiers\nin the sense lines.\ntests of the C_mlnicomputer\ncomputer The results of the transient\nwere reviewed to determine susceptibility\ntheir applicability\nto the AES\norganization.\nThe most transient-sensitive\nareas of the digital circuits\nwereline sense be the memoryReduction lines the susceptibility lines the the defound to amplifiers.\nsense\nlay\nof and the output\nof of basic\ncomputer organization\nto voltage transients\ncan be achieved in the re]\n\norganized system by improving the physical layout of the sense lines,\nlimiting the bandwidth of the sense amplifiers,\nproviding alternate\nstrobing of the TMR memories,\nand isolating the memory ground planes.\n\n_I\nI\n\nA logiccircuit\nwas developedduring the studywhich votes on the\ntriplex\nlogic, detectsa disagreement between the three inputsto the\nvoter,isolates\nthe error to one of thethree inputs,and turns offthe\n\nt\n\nfaulty input and one circuit two good inputs.\nmodule, this logic of the effectively\nswitches If a failure occurs in toa a.\ndown that module\nsimplex operating mode.\nAn automatic\nTMR/Simplex\noperating mode\nmore modules operate\nof the system one or\nwas therefore provided simplex reorganized restsystem in which operates\nfor the while the\nTMR.

The reorganized AES computer was\npartitioned into four pluggable modules per channel\nThe functional relationship between the total intermodule connections per circuit as the partitioning is carried to lower levels results\nin a similarly shaped curve with the break point at about ten modules.\nThe same general relationship exists between modularization and the\ntotal number of voters required per machine.\nAlthough the AES computer was partitioned into four modules primarily to optimize the failure isolation capabilities of the built-in detection circuitry,\nthis modularization level is well within the cost constraints of total circuits,\nintermodule connections, and total number of voters required.\nThe data adapter portion of the AES computer system was analyzed\nin a similar manner resulting in a partitioning of seven pluggable modules per channel.

One\nimportant feature of the simulator\nallows the injection of logic fmllts\ninto the simulated\nsyste_\nto examine the phenomenon of error propagation, and this feature was used to evaluate the error detection and f,_tult\nlocating capabilities\nof the built-in test circuitry,\nSimulator\nflexibility\nalso allowed the effects of various partitioning\nschemes to be evaluated\nand thus provided a rapid method for optimally placing voters and error\ndetectors\nin the system organization.\nIn the TMR Saturn V computer and data adapter,\ndisagreement\ndetectors\nprovide an output if any of the triplicated\nmodules fail, These\ndetectors\nconsist of a three-way\nexclusi-,e OR connected to the three\nchannel inputs to each voter circult.\nThese disagreement\ndetectors\nand several modified variations\nprovided the basic means for detecting\nerrors\nin the computer system under study.\nThe outputs of these detectors were "OR\'d" together\nin a logical network to provide the basic\nmeans for fault isolation.\nThe sim" _,ator was used to determine\noptimum\ntiming of the detector in the computer system and to\ndetecting efficiency of the built-in test circuitry.\nIn\nfailure simulations,\nover 99 percent of all simulated\ntected.\nSimulation also proved that failure isolation\nmodule level was attained in the reorganized\ncomputer\ndisagreement\ndetector "OR\'ing" network.\n\n,,_\n\nplacement\nand\nevaluate the error\nseveral hundred\nfailures\nwere deto a replaceable\nsystem by the\n\nModule and channel switching,\nboth a\',tomatic and manual, were\ninvestigated\nas inflight techniques for improving system reliability\nand\nfor supporting maintenance\nactivities.\nSingle channel operation of some\nmodules or of the entire system for selected mission phases or operational conditions was considered.\n\n24\n\nTw9 few mcdes o: operation were derived: 1) TMR/Simplex and\n2) TMR/Switchable _pare. In the TMR/Simplex mode, one or more\nmodules of the system may operate simplex while the remainder of the\nsystem operates TMR. One operational simplex module is turned off\nwith every failed simplex moQ_l]e, resulting in an appreciable system\nreliability inc,\'ease over the basic TMR mode. An even greater reliability increase is provided (at the cost of additional test and switching circuitry) by the switchable spare mode in which the turned off operational\nmodule is made available as a spare for the operating simplex module\nin the TMR/Simplex mode.\nFor maximum long-term reliability in noncritical phases of the\nmission, the system may be operated ip the simplex mode with two inoperative channels available as built-in spax-es. The "multiprocessing"\npotential ol operating the three channels of the TMR system as three independent systems capable of Delfforming independent functions of lifesupport system processing,\nexperimental system processing,\nand vehicle control (for example) has been found to be feasible.\nFurther study\nis required to achieve this potential, however, by developing means for\ndecL,_pling channgls, as well as simply controlling their on-off s_tus.\nThe voting and switching logic developed during the study has\nmade possible an on-line repair capability for the comp_lter system\nwhile operating in the TMR mode. Failed modules may be replaced\nwith spare modules without interrupting normal operation ._f the system.\nSimilarly, au_matic self-repair\ncapability is feasible with the new\nlogic by instrumenting a fourth or spare channel. The new logic will\ndetect a disagreement between the three operating channels, isolate the\nfailure to the specific module and channel, turn off the failed s,_mplex\nmodule, and switch in the spare from the inoperative fourth cha_mel.\nA primary goal was defined early in the study to automate the error detection and fault isolation functions and thereby minimize crew\nrequirements\nfor inflight maintenance.\nTraining, experience,\nand test\ninformation required by the crew to effect repair were made negligible\nby the hardware approaches pursued in the study. Man-in-the-loop\noperations required by the AES instrumentation were limited to reading\na bank of indicator lights to determine the location of a failure and to\nmaking a manual replacement of the failed module. Test and packaging\napproaches were directed toward elim/nating the need for special test\nequipment or special tools to effect inflight maintenance.\nSemiautomatic\nrepair methods in which the astronaut switches in wired-in spare modules or changes operating mode were also investigated,\nas well au fully\nautomatic repair and mode changing.\n\n25\n\n,%\n\n3.4\n\nFabrication\n\nand Test\n\nLimited fabrication\nand test was required\nin _he study to prove the\nfeasibility\nof inflight maintenance\nin a high humidity,\nzero gravity environment.\nA nonfunctional\nmockup was fabricated\nof the reconfigured\ncomputer\nsystem illustrating\nthe organizational\nand packaging concepts selected\nduring the study for AES applications.\nAs shown in the photograph\nof\nFigure 6, a depar_.h _ from _he conventional\nsealed uait designs of aerospace computers\nwas made in favor of individually\nsea_d modules.\nIn\nthis packaging approach the only sealing problem_\nlie with the connectors -- both module and cable connectors.\nExploratory\ntests performed\non the Saturn V page connectors\nresulted in the selection of a gasket-silicone\ngel sealing technique for the\nAES connectors.\nSeveral connectors\nwere loaded with silicone gr-, Je\nand tested for contact resistance\nand leakage resistance\nbetween adjacent\npins.\nThe grease had no measurable\neffect on contact re,_istance for\nall connectors\ntested.\nImmersion\ntests for leakage resist_mce\nshowed\nthe need for a gasket in addition to the grease to provide a pin-wiping\naction both on insertion\nand disconnect\nof the male half of the connector\nwith the female.\nWith the gasket-grease\ncombination,\nthe connectors\nwere mated and remated while immersed\nin salt water with no appreciable change in megger readings between adjacent pins.\nNine representative\nreplaceable\nmodules were prepared\nto illustrate a solution to the problem of packaging and sparing for the adverse\nAES environment\nby modifying Saturn V breadboard\ncomputer logic\npages.\nThe page itself was sealed with a rubber compound (RTV) and\nthe female connector\n(in the test equipment) which mates with the page\nwas prepared with the gasket-silicone\ngel combination.\nA photograph\nof a modified module and _he mating female connector\nis shown in Figure 7.\nA special environmental\ntest chamber was fabricated\n(Figure 8) to\nprovide simulation\nof the high humidity,\nzero gravity AES environment.\nThe water tank on the lower left-hand side of the chamber is equipped\nwith heater,\nblower,\nand controls to produce a relative humidity varing\nbetween 80 and 100 percent.\nThe temperature\nwithin the chamber was\nmaintained in the region of 100\xc2\xb0F to 125\xc2\xb0F.\nTo simulate the migration\neffects of free moisture\nto electrical\nconnectors\nin zero gravity,\na\nwater solution of 0. 22-percent\nsodium chloride and up to 1 percent urea\nw,_ sprayed on the test modules once each hour for the entire continuous\ntest period of 58 da},s. An electrical\ncharge was applied to the spray\nto simulate ionization of free moisture.\nRubber gloves sealed to one\n\n26\n\nwall of the chamber allowed modules to be unmated and remated at intervals during the test period without affecting the chamber environment,\nthus simulating maintenance activity (module replacement) and perhaps\nthe suited astronaut conditions.\n\nFigure

technique for sealing connectors.\nAlthough the\npurpose of Phase II testing was not to evaluate sealing of the module itself (replaceable\nmodules in the AES computer would be hermetically\nsealed as individual components),\nthe Saturn V pages used to represent\nAES replaceable\nmodules had to be sealed to prevent logic failures in\nthe high humidity environment\nwhile testing the connector\nsealing technique.\n\n"_\n\nDC voltages were applied to certain pins of each module, and approximately\n20 pins were monitored\non each module for changes in the\nresulting\nstatic patterns.\nVery few test points showed any appreciable\nchange in voltage level during the first month of testing although the\nmagnesium-lithium\nframes of the Saturn V logic pages showed drastic\ndeterioration,\nThose test points which did exhibit appreciable\nchange\n(over 5 or 10 millivolts)\nweze found to be located on those pages showing the most frame deterioration\nindicating
