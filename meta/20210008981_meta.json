Bacon plots, which are low-thrust analogs to porkchop plots, give insight into key parameters and sensitivities of possible transfers to Mars (or other destinations). They are mission and parameter specific, and can be created to represent single or multiple legs. This paper outlines the creation process and lessons learned in interpreting the results. An example is given on how bacon plots have been employed for complex mission-level optimization.", "title": "Low-thrust trajectory Bacon plots for Mars mission design", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008981, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Olikara, Zubin"}}, "id": "a9121464f199426b9e59d5803362df55"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008981, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nicholas, Austin K."}}, "id": "a5c5be63aa434314a64eea8d6d22d70b"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008981, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Laipert, Frank"}}, "id": "4bdf6af6d87442c4ba9baa743a546151"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008981, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Woolley, Ryan C."}}, "id": "00596b27e56143c39d871bd93deeb111"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:26:17.3086780+00:00", "id": 20210008981, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/50244", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210008981, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2019", "id": "6b17b8be36c646159c26bc34e2b4d13c", "publicationDate": "2019-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
