Maybe one of the most convincing arguments in favor of this kind of reasoning has been given by Davis in his paper on diagnosis from first principles (Davis 1984). Following their guidelines we have developed a system to verify the behavior of a satellite-based instrument GOME (which will be measuring Ozone concentrations in the near future (1995)). We start by giving a description of model-based monitoring. Besides recognizing that something is wrong, we also like to find the cause for misbehaving automatically. Therefore, we show how the monitoring technique can be extended to model-based diagnosis.", "title": "Model-based monitoring and diagnosis of a satellite-based instrument", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950020969, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bos, Andre"}, "organization": {"name": "Organisatie voor Toegepast Natuurwetenschappelijk Onderzoek", "location": "Delft, Netherlands"}}, "id": "b44f6cfa7633412d8c47981e4b75068a"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950020969, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Callies, Jorg"}, "organization": {"name": "European Space Agency.
