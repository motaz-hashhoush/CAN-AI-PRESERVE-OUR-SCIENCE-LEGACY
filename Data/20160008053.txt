Hydrazine\nis a toxic, hazardous fuel that requires special safety\nequipment and processes for handling and loading. In\nrecent years, there has been development of two green\npropellants (less toxic) that could enable their use in\nAPUs. The Swedish government, in concert with the\nSwedish Space Corporation, has developed a propellant based on ammonium dinitramide (LMP-103S)\nthat was flown on the Prisma spacecraft in 2010. The\nUnited States Air Force (USAF) has been developing\na propellant based on hydroxylammonium nitrate (AFM315E) that is scheduled to fly on the Green Propellant\nInfusion Mission in the spring of 2016 to demonstrate\napogee and reaction control thrusters. However, no one\nelse in the Agency is currently pursuing use of green\npropellants for application to the APUs. Per the TA-01\nLaunch Propulsion Roadmap, the Space Technology\nMission Directorate had identified the need to have\na green propellant APU by 2015. This is our motivation\nfor continuing activities.\nThe plan proposed by NASA Marshall Space Flight\nCenter (MSFC) is to utilize existing F-16 and Space\nShuttle hardware to provide a low-cost demonstration\ntestbed for green propellant APUs. During preparation\nfor the TDM12 solicitation, MSFC was able to acquire\na solid rocket booster gas generator and an orbiter APU\nresiding at White Sands Test Facility that were no longer needed by the Space Launch System (SLS). Since\nthese test assets are limited in number, a Department\nof Defense equivalent asset was identified. The F-16\n\n134\n\nfighter jet uses H-70 propellant (30% diluted hydrazine)\nfor providing the plane emergency power if the pilot\nloses engine power. Since there have been over 4,400\nF-16 planes built, there are a number of these planes\nthat have been retired and await destruction at the Davis\nMonthan Air Force Base in Tucson, AZ.\nThe feasibility testing funded by MSFC investment\nwas to utilize a modified version of the USAF\xe2\x80\x99s green\npropellant to decompose with the F-16 gas generator,\na main component within the emergency power unit\n(EPU) assembly. MSFC worked closely with engineers/\nchemists at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL),\nadding water content to the AF-M315E to lower anticipated combustion temperatures. AFRL mixed the propellant, performed catalyst heating tests, and provided\n5 gallons of propellant to MSFC for test operations.\nMSFC disassembled the EPU and configured the test\nsetup shown in figure 1. A series of 64 pulse operations\nwere performed over the course of 2 days.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\nDemonstration of green propellant with an alternative\ncatalyst material could lead to cost savings across the\nF-16 fleet and SLS booster nozzle gimballing. This testing could further be extended to testing the other green\nmonopropellant that has matured: LMP-103S. Both\nleading green propellants offer not only increase performance characteristics compared to hydrazine (density\nand impulse) but also are less hazardous. Safety testing\nreveals that SCAPE (self-contained atmospheric protective ensemble) suits are not required for transport,\nloading, and handling of the propellant, which would\nlower operations costs and allow for serial operations to\noccur for aircraft and spacecraft preparation.\n\nPotential Applications\nBesides the F-16 EPU and the SLS booster APU, the\nU-2 spy plane also uses a form of hydrazine for engine\nrestart at altitude. Given further interest, there may be\nthe opportunity to investigate that platform as well.\n\nCIF\n\nFigure 1: F-16 gas generator installed at MSFC Component Development Area Test Cell.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nReferences\t\n\nMSFC recently completed feasibility testing of an F-16\nEPU gas generator using a variant of the AF-M315E\n(higher water content). MSFC demonstrated that the\ngas generator can develop 300 psi of pressure. What is\nunique about this accomplishment is that the propellant\nmixture was reactive with the hydrazine catalyst material (Shell 405). With additional testing, there could be\na significant cost savings and safety improvement if\nthe F-16 System Program Office decides to implement\nthis propellant across the vast fleet of F-16 users. Likewise, SLS may consider transitioning from hydrazinepowered APUs to a green propellant alternative.\n\nMSFC 2014 Center Innovation Fund Final Report,\nGreen Application for Space Power, J.
