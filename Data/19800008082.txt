The test bearings design\nwas computer optimized for high-speed operation. Temperature distribution\nand bearing heat generation were determined as a function of shaft speed,\nradial and thrust loads, lubricant flow rates and lubricant inlet temperarure. The high-speed design tapered roller bearing operated successfully\nat shaft speeds up to 20 000 rpm under heavy thrust and radial loads. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with the high-speed design bearing were\nsignificantly less than those of a modified stanuard bearing tested previously. Cup cooling was effective in decreasing the high cup temperatures\nto levels equal to the cone Lemperature.\nINTRODUCTION\nTapered-roller bearings are being used in some helicopter transmissions\nto carry combined radial, thrust and moment loads and in particular, those\nloads from bevel gears such as nigh-speed input pinions. Tapered-roller\nbearings have greater load capacity for a given envelope or for a given\nbearing weight than the combinations of ball and cylindrical roller bearings\ncommonly used in this application. Speed limitations have restricted the\nuse of tapered-roller bearings to lower speed applications relative to ball\nand cylindrical roller bearings. The speed of tapered-roller bearings is\nlimited to approximately 0.5 million DN (a cone-rib tangential velocity of\napproximately 36 m/sec (700 it/min)) unless special attention is given to\nlubricating and designing the cone-rib/roller-large-end contact. At higher\nspeeds, centrifugal effects starve this critical coma^t of lubricant.\nBy supplying lubricant directly to this critical contact through holes\nin the cone, tapered-roller bearings have been successfully operated to 1.81\nmillion DN under heavy combined radial and thrust loads (1). 1 Under\nthrust load only conditions (2) speeds as high as 3.5 million DN have been\nsuccessfully attained.\nThe internal geometry of the bearings used in these tests (1 and 2)\nwere standard catalog series designs with modifications of the roller spherI\n\nNumbers ill\n\n\t designate references at end of paper.\n\nical ends and lubrication holes through the cone. Also, some of the bearings used in (2) had cages designed for hig l--speed operation, and the rollers, cones and cups were made of CBS 100(1:: ..aterial.\n,se of computer programs can increase the capability of designing\nT \t\nand analyzing tapered-roller bearings for high-speed applications. These\nprograms, described in (3 and 4), take into account the difficulty of lubricating the contacts in high-speed tapered-roller bearings and consider the\neffects of the elastohydrudynamic (END) films in these contacts. The analysis of (3) was used to select the internal geometry for the high-speed design tapered-roller bearing used for the research reported herein.\nThe objective of this research was to determine the operating characteristics, including temperature distribution and heat generation of a\nhigh-speed design 120.0-mm- (4.75-in.-) bore tapered-roller bearing at\nspeeds to 20 000 rpn, (2.4 million DN). The cone-rib tangential velocity at\nthis highest speed was 158 m/sec (31 200 ft/min). Independent test variables were shaft speed, radial and thrust load, lubricant flow rate, and\nlubricant inlet temperature. The results were compared with the operating\ncharacteristics of modified standard test bearings reported in (1).\nAPPARATUS AND PROCEDURE\nhigh-Speed Tapered-Roller Bearing Test Rig\nThe test rig used for this effort was that used in (1 and 5) except for\nan improved spindle design with closer spacing of the two test bearings.\nThe 75 kilowatt (100-hp) motor was replaced with a 93 kilowatt (125-hp)\nmotor with improved starting torque characteristics required for the higher\nspeed testing.\nOne of two test bearings mounted on a spindle is shown in Fig. 1. The\ncup of each test bearing is mounLed in a test head assembly. The right test\nhead assembly is mounted rigidly to the machine frame; whereas the left test\nhead assembly is axially movable and is supported on ball and roller ways.\nThis arrangement allows thrust loading of the test bearings with a pair of\nhydraulic actuators. Radial load is applied to the test bearings by a hydraulic actuator that exerts a force on a center housing containirg two cylindrical roller load bearings mounted near the center of the spindle.\nA flat-belt-pulley system is used to drive the spindle from an electric\nmotor. The desired spindle speeds are chosen by exchanging drive pulleys on\nthe motor. The test spindle is hollow and contains annular grooves to distribute lubricant to radial holes at both the large end and the small end of\nthe test bearing (fig. 2) and for lub-icaLion of the load bearing. A stationary lubrication tube delivers tie desired lubricant flow to the annular\ngrooves.\nThe lubrication system contains separately controlled circuits for\ncone-rib (large end) lubrication, small end lubrication, cup (outer ring)\ncooling, and load bearing lubrication. The lubricant flow through each\n\n2\n\ncircuit is metered with a variable flow control valve. A 10 micron filter\nand an oil-water heat exchanger are common to all the separate circuits.\nThermocouples are installed for temperature measurements of each test\nbearing cup outer surface, each cylindrical load bearing outer ring, and oil\ninlet and outlet of both test and load bearings. Temperatures of the cone\nbore and cone face of the test bearing (fig. 2) on the drive end of the test\nspindle were measured with thermocouples and transmitted with an FM telemetry system. A more detailed description of this test rig is given in (5).\nTest Bearings\nThe tapered-roller test bearings had a bore of 120.65 mm (4.75 in.).\nThe remainder of the bearing internal geometry and external dimensions were\nselected by computer optimization with due consideration for economical manufacturing utilizing existing tooling.\nThe computer analysis of (3) was used to select optimum cup and roller\nangles and roller size with a fixed bore Lf 120.65 mm (4.75 in.) for a load\nand speed condition of 26 7UO N (6000 lb) radial and 53 4UO N (12 OUO lb)\nthrust and a range of shaft speeds from 12 500 to 20 ON rpm. The analysis\nof (3) requires complete definition of a tapered roller bearing \t\nits immediate environment. The optimization process using this analysis consisted\nof evaluating over 30 selected combinations of cup and roller angles and\nToller diameters, each defining a unique bearing internal geometry. These\ncombinations were all within the constraints fixed by good design practice\nfor tapered-roller bearings (3). Criteria for comparison were bearing fatigue life, total bearing heat generation, and cone-rib contact stress and\nheat genera ion. Greater consideration was given to those combinations\nwhich have \'Lower stress and heat generation at the cone-rib contact. Further details of the optimization variables are given in the appendix.\nThe geometry of the computer optimized design is given in table 1.\nThis geometry was reviewed by a bearing manufacturer to consider use of\nexisting tooling for more economical manuiacturing. As a result, some compromise of the geometry was reached and checked with computer analysis to be\nsatisfactory. This selected geometry is shown in table 1, along with the\ngeometry of the standard bearing tested and reported in (1).\nThe rollers in the selected bearing were fully crowned with a crown\nradius of 25.4 m (1000 in.) and had a spherical end radius equal to 80 percent of the apex length. The ma^,, rial of the cup, cone and rollers was\ncase-carburized consumable-electrode vacuum-melted CBS IUOUM. The cage was\none-piece machined AISI 4340 steel with silver plating and was guided by\nlands on the cone. The hrrdness, case depth, and surtace finished specifications are shown in table 2.\nThe cone contained 40 oil holes, 1.016 mm (0.040 in.) in diameter at\neach end, drilled through from a manifold on the cone bore to the undercuts\nat each raceway end, as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, six oil holes were\ndrilled at each end to lubricate the cage land riding surfaces.\n\n3\n\nThe basic dynamic load ratings for this bearing are 70 700 N (15 900\nlb) radial load and 51 600 N (11 600 lb) thrust load. (The thrust or radial\nload which gives 10 percent lite of 9G million cone revolutions.) The Antifriction bearing Manufacturers Association (AFbMA) basic dynamic capacity is\n255 000 N (57 400 lb). This bearing has approximately 10 percent less capacity than the standard bearing of (1), due to its optimization of performance at higher speeds.\nProcedure\nThe test procedure was adjusted according to the test conditions to be\nevaluated. Generally, a program cycle was defined which would allow the\nevaluation of a number of conditions without a major interruption. Test\nparameters such as load, speed, and oil inlet temperature were maintained\nconstant while the tester was in operation. Lubricant flow rates were adjusted during operation. Tne test bearings were allowed to reach an equilibrium condition before data were recorded and the next test condition waa\nsought.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n_ect of Lubricant Flew on Bearing Temperatures\nEf `\nR\t\n\nThe effect of lubricant flow rate was determined for a variety of\nspeeds, loads and oil-in temperatures. Lubricant was supplied through holes\nat both the small end and the large end of the cone as shown in Fig. 2. No\njet lubrication was used. Temperatures of the 120.65-mm- (4.75-in.-) bore\ntapered roller test bearing at the drive end of the test spindle were measured on the cone bore and the cone face as well as on the outer surface of\nthe cup. Oil-out temperatures were also measured. Test s p indle speeds\nranged from 6000 to 20 U00 rpm. Thrust loads varied from 2t 700 to 53 400 N\n(6000 to 12 000 lb). Radial loads varied from 13 300 to 2b 700 N 0000 to\nb000 ]b). Total lubricant flow rates varied from U.OU38 to 0.0151 m3/min\n(1.0 Co 4.0 gpm). The lubricant used was a 5-ce ntistoke neopentypolyl\n(tetra) ester, MIL-L-23699.\nTest bearing temperatures and oil-out temperatures, measured at these\nconditions, are shown in Figs. 3 to 6. Figure 3 shows very little effect of\nradial load on cone-face temperatures. The effects of thrust load were\nlikewisa small. This data is typical throughout the range of variables.\nThat is, regardless of speed, oil-in temperature, or flow rates, load had\nlittle effect on bearing or oil-out temperature. Therefore, all the data\nshown in the remainder of this report are for one load condition, that is,\n53 400 N (12 000 lb) thrust load and 26 700 N (6000 lb) radial load.\nFigure 4 shows the general decrease in bearing and oil-out temperatures\nwith increased lubricant flow rate to the large end and a constant 0.0038\nm 3 1min (1.0 gpm) to the small end. At the higher speeds, for example\n18 500 rpm in Fig. 4(d), the effect of the lubricant flow rate is much\ngreater than at the lower speeds. Bearing temperatures at 18 5UO rpm are\ndecreased as much as 28 K (50 0 F) as total flow rate is increased from\n0.0076 m 3 /min (2.0 gpm) to 0.0151 m 3 /min (4.0 gpm). The temperature of\nthe cup outer surface is greater than the cone bore or cone face throughout\nthe range of flow rate and speed conditions.\n4\n\nQf.\n\nFigure 5 shows the effect of increasing flow rate to the small end of\nthe bearing from 0.0019 m 3 /min (0.5 gpm) to 0.0057 m 3 /min (1.5 gpm) with\na constant 0.0076 m 3 /min (2.0 gpm) at the large end. Greater effects of\nsmall-end flow rate occurred at the higher speeds. Comparison of Figs. 4\nand 5, shows that small-end flow rate has a greater effect on cup temperature than on cone-face temperature, and the opposite is true for large-end\nflow rate. This effect should be expected since the lubricant introduced at\nthe small end is pumped through the bearing to the large end and in doing so\nis thrown centrifugally to the cup raceway surface thus cooling the cup.\nLubricant introduced through the large end cools the cone rib and quickly\nexits the bearing with less cooling effect on the cup. The large effect of\nsmall-end flow rate on cone-bore temperature at the higher speeds (figs.\n5(d) and (e)) indicates its effectiveness in cooling the cone.\nIt is apparent that, for speeds in the range of 15 000 to 20 ODU rpm,\nflow rates of 0.0076 m \' /min (2.0 gpm) at the large end and 0.0038 m3/min\n(1.0 gpm) at the small end arc near optimum for this design and size of\nbearing. Smaller flow rates give significantly higher temperatures, and\nlarge flow rates only increase bearing heat generation as will be shown\nlater.\nEffect of Shaft Speed\nThe effect of shaft speed on bearing and oil-out temperatures is shown\nin Fig. 6 for a total flow rate of 0.0114 m 3 /min (3.0 gpm). The greater\neffect of speed on cup outer surface temperature than on cone-bore temperature is readily apparent. The oil-out temperature increases with speed at\nabout the same rate as the cup outer-surface temperature. The cage is\nguided on lands on the cone, and greater heat generation at those guiding\nsurfaces at higher speeds is expected, along with higher cone temperature.\nApparently the lubricant flow through the holes in the cone (both large and\nsmall ends) very adequately cools the cone, and by the time it reaches the\ncup raceway, it has been heated appreciably and has less cooling capacity.\nAs will be shown later, cup cooling can be used to decrease the high cup\ntemperatures at the higher speeds.\nThe test bearing cage speed was measured at all shaft speed conditions. The ratio of cage speed to shaft speed did not vary more than 1 percent from a nominal value of 0.445 throu,hout the range of speed, load and\nlubricant flow conditions.\nStable operating temperatures were achieved at ail speed, load and lubricant flow rate conditions. Some of the lower lubricant flow rate points\nwere not attempted at 20 000 rpm due to anticipated excessiv: temperatures.\nObservations of the bearings after tests at 20 OOU rpm showed no signs of\nsurface distress on the roller-raceway or roller/cone-rib contacting surfaces. Likewise, cage contacting surfaces showed no abnormal wear or distress.\n\n5\n\nEffect of Oil-In Temperature\nThe effect of oil-in temperature on bearing and oil-out temperatures is\nshown in Fig. 7. Temperatures at an oil-in t?mperature of 35U K (17U0 F)\nand 18 500 rpm shaft speed are shown compared with data from Fig. 4(b) at\n364 K (1950 F) oil-in temperatures. At the lower oil-in temperature,\nbearing and oil-out temperatures generally were 6 to 14 K (10 0 to 25 0 F)\nless than at the higher oil-in temperature. ThE cone-bore temperature was\ndecreased the full 14 K (25 0 F) of the decrease in oil-in temperature.\nLeast effected was the cup outer-surface temperature.\nSimilar data was also obtained at a shaft speed of 12 500 rpm where the\ntemperatures were generally 6 to 10 K (10 0 to 18 0 F) lower for the lower\noil-in temperatures. Least\t\nected was the cone-bore temperature. Generally, for both shaft speeds, the bearing and oil-out temperatures were\neffected slightly more by oil-in temperature at the higher flow rates.\nEffect of Cup Cooling\nAs was shown in Fig. 6, the highest bearing temperatures measured were\nat the cup-outer surface, and the difference from cone temperatures was increasingly greater at higher speeds. The higher cup temperatures may be\ndecreased with the use of -:up cooling oil flowing in the cup housing in contact with the outer surface of the cup. Figure 8 shows the effects of cup\ncooling flows up to 0.0028 m 3 /min (0.75 gpm) at 18 5U0 rpm and 350 K\n(1700 F) oil-in temperature. As expected, greatest effects were at the\ncup-outer surface where temperatures were decreased 11 K (200 F) with a\ncup cooling flow of 0.0019 m 3 /min (0.5 gpm). Higher cooling flows had\nlittle or no effect.\nLimited data was also obtained at 18 500 rpm and an oil-in temperature\nof 364 K (1950 F). As shown in table 3, a cup cooling flow rate of 0.0038\nm 3 /min (1.0 gpm) was sufficient to lower the cup outer surface 14 K (250\nF) or to a level equal to the cone-bore temperature.\nEffects of Speed and Lubricant Flow on Bearing Power Loss\nThe power loss from the bearing is dissipated in the form of heat by\nconduction to the lubricant and by convection and radiation to the surrounding environment. Lubricant outlet temperature from the bearing was measured\nfor all conditions of flow.\t\nHeat transferred to the lubricant was calculated using the following standard heat transfer equation:\nQT\n\n= MC P (tout- tin)\t\n\nwhe re\nQT\t\n\ntotal heat transfer to lubricant J/min (Btu/min)\n\nM\t\n\nlubricant mass flow, kg/min (lb/min)\n\n(1)\n\nC\n\n\t\n\nspecific heat, J/(kg)(K) ((Btu/lb)(OF))\n\ntout\t\n\noil outlet temperature, K (0F)\n\nLin\t\n\noil inlet temperature, K (0F)\n\nThe result of these heat transfer calculations are shown in Fig. 9 as a\nfunction of total flow rate (For convenience, heat values were converted\nfrom J/min to kW.). The heat transferred to the lubricant increases with\nincreased lubricant flow rate. The effect is greater at higher speeds.\nFigure 10 shows an even greater effect of shaft speed on heat transferred to the lubricant. The effect of shaft speed can be closely approximated by the relation Q T a N 1. 35 where N is the shaft speed in r,m.\nThese increases are expected due to increased lubricant drag or churning, These heat quantities are only a portion of the heat generated in the\ntest bearing and do not include ;,eat transferred from the bearing by condi \xe2\x80\xa2 ction, convection, and radiation. At higher bearing temperatures, the\nmeat transferred by these latter forms should become a greater portion of\nthe total.\nComparison with Standard Design clearing\nIn (1 and 5) data from tests with a modified standard catalog series\ntapered-roller bearing of the same bore (120.65 mm (4.75 in.)) was presented\nat speeds up to 15 000 rpm. Loads and total flow rates were over the same\nrange as those reported herein for the high-speed design bearing. Major\ndifferences in the two bearing designs were smaller cup angle, smaller pitch\nand outside diameters, and fewer rollers in the high speed design (table\n1). The cage of the high speed design bearing was made to be guided by\nlands on the cone whereas the standard bearing had a stamped steel cage made\nto be guided b\\ the rollers. The latter design cage has lesser strength fchigh-speed operation.\nAlthough lubricant to the standard bearing was directed through holes\nin the large end of the cone to the cone-rib surface, lubricant at the small\nend was through a pair of jets directed at the small end of the rollers.\nComparisons herein were made with equal flow rates for both bearings at both\nthe large end and the small end. At the small end, a constant of 0.0038\nm I3 /min (1.0 gpm) was used, and that was fed through jets for the standard\ndesign and through the cone small end for the high-speed design.\nMaterials with higher temperature capabilities were used for the highspeed design bearings. Cups, cones, and rollers were made of CBS-1000M, and\nthe cage was AIS1 4340. The standard design bearing had AIS1 4320 cups,\ncones, and rollers and AISI IUIU cages.\nIn Fig. 11, cone-face temperatures of the high-speed design from Fig. 4\nare compared with data from (5). The symbols are used to identify the\ncurves at each flow rate. At 15 UUU rpm, the high-speed design bearing\noperates b to 11 K (15 0 to 200 F) cooler than the standard design. The\n\n7\n\nimprovement at 6000 rpm is much less. The cup outer-surface temperature is\nalso lower for the high-speed design bearing as shown in Fig. 12. Here, the\nimprovement is slightly less than that at the cone face.\nAlso shown in Fig. 9 are data for the standard design bearing showing\nheat transferred to the lubricant at 6000 and 15 UUU rpm. The high-speed\nf\t\n\ndesign bearing has lower heat generation, as represented by heat transferred\n\n\xc2\xb1\t\n\nto the lubricant, than the standard design bearing at both speeds. As shown\nin Fig. 10, the improvement with the high-speed design is approximately 16\npercent throughout the range of 6000 to 15 UOO rpm.\nSUMMARY\n\ni\nThe performance of 120.65-mm (4.75-in.) bore computer-optimized\ntapered-roller bearings was investigated at shaft speeds up to 20 000 rpm\n(cone-rib tangential velocities un to 1513 m/sec (31 200 ft/min)). Temperature distribution and bearing heat generation were determined as a function\nof shaft speed, radial and thrust loads, lubricant flow rate, and lubricant\ninlet temperature. Lubricant was supplied through the cone at both the\nlarge end and the small end of the roller. Test conditions included shaft\nspeeds from bOOO to 2U 000 rpm, radial loads from 13 3UU to 26 7UO N (3000\nto 6000 lb), thrust loads from 26 700 to 53 400 N (6000 to 12 UUU lb), lubricant flow rates from 0.0036 to O.U151 m 3 /min (1.0 to 4.0 gpm), and lubricant inlet temperatures of 350 and 364 K (170 0 and 195 1 F). \'fhe following results were obtained:\n1. The computer-optimized high-speed design tapered-roller bearing operated successfully at shaft speeds up to 20 000 rpm under heavy thrust and\nradial loads. Stable temperatures were reached and no surface distress was\nobserved.\n2. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with the high speed design\nbearing were significantly less than those of a modified standard bearing\ntested previously.\n3. Bearing temperatures and heat generation increased as expected with\nincreased shaft speed. The highest temperatures measured were at L.ie cup\nouter surface.\n4.\n\nWith increased lubricant flow-rates (either large end or small end),\n\nbearing temp eratures decreased and heat generation increased. A total flow\nrate as low as U.0114 m 3 /min (3.0 gpm) gave stable operating temperatures\nat 20 000 rpm without excessive bearing heat generation.\n\n8\n\n\t\n\nAPPENDI X\nThe computer optimization utilized the program described in (3).

California.\n16 Ahst,ect\n\nThe performance of 120. 65-mm- (4. 75-in. -) bore high-speed design tapered roller bearings\nwas investigated at shaft speeds to 20 000 rpm (2.4 million DN) under combined thrust and\nradial load. The test bearinf; design was computer optimized for high-speed uperation. Temperature distribution and hearing heat generation Nvere determined as a function of shaft speed,\nradial and thrust loads, lubricant flow rates and lubricant inlet temperature. The high-speed\ndesign tapered roller hearing operated successfully at shaft speeds up to 20 000 rpni under\nheavy thrust and radial loads. Bearing temperatures and heat generation with the high-speed\ndesign bearing were significantly less than those of a modified standard bearing tested previously. Cup cooling was effective in decreasing the high cup temperatures to levels equal to\nthe cone temperature.\n\n11 Key Wards ISuggmWd by Authnrtsll\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n18 bstnbuhon Statement\n\nRolling element bearing; Roller bearity,s;\n\t\nTapered-roller bearing; high-speed hearings\n\n19 Security Class f lot this reporto\n\nUnclassified\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\nUnclassified - unlimited\nSTAR Category 37\n\n20 Security Ciass,f tot thrs Pagel\n\n\t\n\n21 No of Pages\t\n\nUnclassified\n\nFor sole by the National Technical Information Service Spntip. held Vupinla 22161\n\n1 22\n\n~\n\n'
