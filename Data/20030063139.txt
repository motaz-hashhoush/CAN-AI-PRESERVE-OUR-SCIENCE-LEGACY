The document is organized into 6 separate volumes as:\nOcean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4\nI: Introduction, Background and Conventions\nII: Instrument Specifications, Characterization and Calibration\nIII: Radiometric Measurements and Data Analysis Methods\nIV: Inherent Optical Properties: Instruments, Characterization, Field Measurements and Data\nAnalysis Protocols\nVolume V: Biogeochemical and Bio-Optical Measurements and Data Analysis Methods\nVolume VI: Special Topics in Ocean Optics Protocols and Appendices\nVolume\nVolume\nVolume\nVolume\n\nThe earlier version of Ocean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 3 (Mueller\nand Fargion 2002, Volumes 1 and 2) is entirely superseded by the seven Volumes of Revision 4 listed above.\nThe new multi-volume format for publishing the ocean optics protocols is intended to allow timely future\nrevisions to be made reflecting important evolution of instruments and methods in some areas, without reissuing the\nentire document. Over the years, as existing protocols were revised, or expanded for clarification, and new protocol\ntopics were added, the ocean optics protocol document has grown from 45pp (Mueller and Austin 1992) to 308pp in\nRevision 3 (Mueller and Fargion 2002). This rate of growth continues in Revision 4. The writing and editorial tasks\nneeded to publish each revised version of the protocol manual as a single document has become progressively more\ndifficult as its size increases. Chapters that change but little, must nevertheless be rewritten for each revision to\nreflect relatively minor changes in, e.g., cross-referencing and to maintain self-contained consistency in the protocol\nmanual. More critically, as it grows bigger, the book becomes more difficult to use by its intended audience. A\nmassive new protocol manual is difficult for a reader to peruse thoroughly enough to stay current with and apply\nimportant new material and revisions it may contain. Many people simply find it too time consuming to keep up\nwith changing protocols presented in this format - which may explain why some relatively recent technical reports\nand journal articles cite Mueller and Austin (1995), rather than the then current, more correct protocol document. It\nis hoped that the new format will improve community access to current protocols by stabilizing those volumes and\nchapters that do not change significantly over periods of several years, and introducing most new major revisions as\nnew chapters to be added to an existing volume without revision of its previous contents.\nThe relationships between the Revision 4 chapters of each protocol volume and those of Revision 3 (Mueller\nand Fargion 2002), and the topics new chapters, are briefly summarized below:\nVolume I: This volume covers perspectives on ocean color research and validation (Chapter 1), fundamental\ndefinitions, terminology, relationships and conventions used throughout the protocol document (Chapter 2),\nrequirements for specific in situ observations (Chapter 3), and general protocols for field measurements, metadata,\nlogbooks, sampling strategies, and data archival (Chapter 4). Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of Volume I correspond directly to\nChapters 1, 2 and 3 of Revision 3 with no substantive changes. Two new variables, Particulate Organic Carbon\n(POC) and Particle Size Distribution (PSD) have been added to Tables 3.1 and 3.2 and the related discussion in\nSection 3.4; protocols covering these measurements will be added in a subsequent revision to Volume V (see\nbelow). Chapter 4 of Volume I combines material from Chapter 9 of Revision 3 with a brief summary of SeaBASS\npolicy and archival requirements (detailed SeaBASS information in Chapter 18 and Appendix B of Revision 3 has\nbeen separated from the optics protocols).\nVolume II: The chapters of this volume review instrument performance characteristics required for in situ\nobservations to support validation (Chapter 1), detailed instrument specifications and underlying rationale (Chapter\n2) and protocols for instrument calibration and characterization standards and methods (Chapters 3 through 5).\nChapters 1 through 5 of Volume II correspond directly to Revision 3 chapters 4 through 8, respectively, with only\nminor modifications.\n\ni\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nVolume III: The chapters of this volume briefly review methods used in the field to make the in situ\nradiometric measurements for ocean color validation, together with methods of analyzing the data (Chapter 1),\ndetailed measurement and data analysis protocols for in-water radiometric profiles (Chapter 2), above water\nmeasurements of remote sensing reflectance (Chapter III-3), determinations of exact normalized water-leaving\nradiance (Chapter 4), and atmospheric radiometric measurements to determine aerosol optical thickness and sky\nradiance distributions (Chapter 5). Chapter 1 is adapted from relevant portions of Chapter 9 in Revision 3. Chapter\n2 of Volume III corresponds to Chapter 10 of Revision 3, and Chapters 3 through 5 to Revision 3 Chapters 12\nthrough 14, respectively. Aside from reorganization, there are no changes in the protocols presented in this volume.\nVolume IV: This volume includes a chapter reviewing the scope of inherent optical properties (IOP)\nmeasurements (Chapter 1), followed by 4 chapters giving detailed calibration, measurement and analysis protocols\nfor the beam attenuation coefficient (Chapter 2), the volume absorption coefficient measured in situ (Chapter 3),\nlaboratory measurements of the volume absorption coefficients from discrete filtered seawater samples (Chapter 4),\nand in situ measurements of the volume scattering function, including determinations of the backscattering\ncoefficient (Chapter 5). Chapter 4 of Volume IV is a slightly revised version of Chapter 15 in Revision 3, while the\nremaining chapters of this volume are entirely new contributions to the ocean optics protocols. These new chapters\nmay be significantly revised in the future, given the rapidly developing state-of-the-art in IOP measurement\ninstruments and methods.\nVolume V: The overview chapter (Chapter 1) briefly reviews biogeochemical and bio-optical measurements,\nand points to literature covering methods for measuring these variables; some of the material in this overview is\ndrawn from Chapter 9 of Revision 3. Detailed protocols for HPLC measurement of phytoplankton pigment\nconcentrations are given in Chapter 2, which differs from Chapter 16 of Revision 3 only by its specification of a new\nsolvent program. Chapter 3 gives protocols for Fluorometric measurement of chlorophyll a concentration, and is not\nsignificantly changed from Chapter 17of Revision 3. New chapters covering protocols for measuring, Phycoerythrin\nconcentrations, Particle Size Distribution (PSD) and Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) concentrations are likely\nfuture additions to this volume.\nVolume VI: This volume gathers chapters covering more specialized topics in the ocean optics protocols.\nChapter 1 introduces these special topics in the context of the overall protocols. Chapter 2 is a reformatted, but\notherwise unchanged, version of Chapter 11 in Revision 3 describing specialized protocols used for radiometric\nmeasurements associated with the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) ocean color vicarious calibration observatory.\nThe remaining chapters are new in Revision 4 and cover protocols for radiometric and bio-optical measurements\nfrom moored and drifting buoys (Chapter 3), ocean color measurements from aircraft (Chapter 4), and methods and\nresults using LASER sources for stray-light characterization and correction of the MOBY spectrographs (Chapter 5).\nIn the next few years, it is likely that most new additions to the protocols will appear as chapters added to this\nvolume.\nVolume VI also collects appendices of useful information. Appendix A is an updated version of Appendix A\nin Revision 3 summarizing characteristics of past, present and future satellite ocean color missions. Appendix B is\nthe List of Acronyms used in the report and is an updated version of Appenix C in Revision 3. Similarly, Appendix\nC, the list of Frequently Used Symbols, is an updated version of Appendix D from Rev. 3. The SeaBASS file\nformat information given in Appendix B of Revision 3 has been removed from the protocols and is promulgated\nseparately by the SIMBIOS Project.\nIn the Revision 4 multi-volume format of the ocean optics protocols, Volumes I, II and III are unlikely to\nrequire significant changes for several years. The chapters of Volume IV may require near term revisions to reflect\nthe rapidly evolving state-of-the-art in measurements of inherent optical properties, particularly concerning\ninstruments and methods for measuring the Volume Scattering Function of seawater. It is anticipated that new\nchapters will be also be added to Volumes V and VI in Revision 5 (2003).\nThis technical report is not meant as a substitute for scientific literature. Instead, it will provide a ready and\nresponsive vehicle for the multitude of technical reports issued by an operational Project. The contributions are\npublished as submitted, after only minor editing to correct obvious grammatical or clerical errors.\n\nii\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation,

Validation\nJames L. Mueller\nCenter for Hydro-Optics and Remote Sensing, San Diego State University, California\nThe overall purpose of the ocean optics protocols document is to provide the ocean color community with\nguidance for acquiring in situ data needed to develop algorithms and validate the performance of, and\nbiogeochemical data sets derived from, satellite ocean color sensors. The first five volumes of this document first\nidentify necessary and desired oceanic and atmospheric variables and appropriate instruments to measure them.\nMethods for characterizing and calibrating those instruments are covered next. Finally, detailed methods are\ndescribed for measuring each category of variables at sea, and for processing and analyzing the data, to derive the\nessential information needed for all aspects of satellite ocean color validation.\nThe present volume provides a vehicle for describing important elements of the in situ ocean color validation\nprocess and infrastructure that don\xe2\x80\x99t fit cleanly into the integrated \xe2\x80\x9cvariable \xe2\x80\x93 instrument \xe2\x80\x93 calibration \xe2\x80\x93\nmeasurement \xe2\x80\x93 analysis\xe2\x80\x9d structure of the topics presented other volumes. As presently envisioned, appropriate\nsubjects for chapters in this volume fall into 3 categories described below.\nOcean observatories use moored buoys instrumented for radiometric, bio-optical and interdisciplinary timeseries measurements, together with supporting programs of survey cruises and/or drifting buoy deployments, to\ndetermine time and space scales of biogeochemical and physical variability in selected regional sites. The scientific\ngoal of such observatories may be narrowly focused on acquiring ocean radiometric and optical data for vicarious\ncalibration of satellite ocean color sensors, e.g the MOBY observatory described in Chapter 2 of this volume\n[carried over unchanged from Chapter 11 of Revision 3 to the protocols (Mueller and Fargion, 2002)]. On the other\nhand, an interdisciplinary ocean observatory can combine comprehensive in situ observations with satellite remotely\nsensed data to derive synergistic descriptions of regional oceanographic features and their evolution in space and\ntime, and provide validation data as well. Applications of moored and drifting instrumented buoys in the second,\nmore general oceanographic context combined with ocean color validation are described in Chapter 3 of this\nvolume.\nAirborne ocean color measurements, strictly speaking, are in situ observations closely related to shipboard\nradiometry topics covered elsewhere in the document. However, methods of airborne ocean color measurement also\nhave much in common with satellite ocean color radiometry itself, including atmospheric corrections, and the\navoidance and correction of sun and sky glint effects. From that perspective, protocols covering the full breadth of\n(satellite or aircraft) ocean color remote sensing technology and algorithms are beyond the scope of Ocean Optics\nProtocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation. Certain aspects of radiometric and other measurements from\naircraft are, nevertheless, relevant and within the scope of this document. These aspects include measurements from\nlow altitude, which are closely akin to shipboard above-water radiance measurements (Vol. III, Ch. 3). Also\nappropriate are airborne measurements from any altitude to determine spatial variability, at scales ranging from m to\n10 Km, in ocean color as a means of relating, e.g. shipboard, in situ measurements at a single point to concurrent\nsatellite ocean color observations; such \xe2\x80\x9csub-pixel\xe2\x80\x9d to small-scale regional bio-optical variability characterizations,\nusing aircraft along-track or image data, become especially critical in Case II waters (Vol. I, Ch. 4). Chapter 4 of\nthis document describes the methods used in one approach to ocean color measurements using relatively simple\nradiometers mounted on light aircraft flown at low altitude, to detemine water-leaving radiance, and from radiance\n\xe2\x80\x9cspectral curvature\xe2\x80\x9d parameters, Chl (chlorophyll a concentration). Other important aspects that could form the\nbasis for future chapters in this topic area include using along-track, nadir-viewing, combined measurements of\nhyperspectral ocean color radiance and oceanographic LIDAR at low altitude (e.g. Hoge and Swift 1986a, 1986b),\nor hyperspectral ocean color images, measured at spatial resolutions ranging less than a few m to 10\xe2\x80\x99s of m using\nimaging sensors flown at higher higher altitudes (e.g. Carder et al. 2003; Dierssen et al. 2003), to determine spatial\ndistributions of water-leaving radiance and derived bio-optical variables.\n\n1\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nRecent progress toward developing new, or improved, protocols is another subject of chapters to be included in\nthis volume. Chapter 5 of the present volume, for example, describes in detail the method by which LASER\nsources of monochromatic radiance and irradiance are used to characterize the stray light responsivity spectrographs,\nwith particular application to those used in the MOBY ocean color observatory (Chapter 2). The chapter concludes\nwith a brief description of ongoing research to apply tunable diode sources (Chapter 5, Fig. 5.39 and related text) to\naffordably transfer and extend this stray-light characterization approach to other spectrographs, and possibly filter\nradiometers. One can envision a future special topics chapter reporting progress in this critical area of research\nradiometric characterization, followed eventually by a more distilled protocol in a future revision (or replacement)\nof Vol. II, Chaper 3. Other future special topic chapters in the recent progress category might review reseach\nresults on new and improved methods and uncertainty budgets for instrument self-shading and platform shading \xe2\x80\x93\nespecially by buoys (Chapter 3) - corrections to in-water upwelled radiance measurements (e.g. Gordon 1985;\nGordon and Ding 1992; Doyle and Zibordi 2002), or for extrapolating in-water upwelled radiance profiles to the sea\nsurface to derive water-leaving radiance. Special topic chapters on these subjects would precede, and provide the\nbackground for, new protocol method descriptions in a subsequent revision of Vol. III, Chapter 2. Reviews of\nresults and methods for merging in situ data and remotely sensed ocean color data to support extended\nbiogeochemical data products and models \xe2\x80\x93 sometimes mentioned examples include suspended particulate organic\nmatter and marine primary productivity - might also be appropriate new chapter subjects in the future.\n\nREFERENCES\nCarder, K.L., C.-C.

Since late 1996, the time\nseries of normalized water-leaving radiances LWN(\xce\xbb) determined from the array of radiometric sensors attached to\nMOBY are the primary basis for the on-orbit calibrations of the USA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor\n(SeaWiFS), the Japanese Ocean Color and Temperature Sensor (OCTS), the French Polarization Detection\nEnvironmental Radiometer (POLDER), the German Modular Optoelectronic Scanner on the Indian Research\nSatellite (IRS1-MOS), and the USA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). The MOBY vicarious\ncalibration LWN(\xce\xbb) reference is an essential element in the international effort to develop a global, multi-year time\nseries of consistently calibrated ocean color products using data from a wide variety of independent satellite sensors.\nA longstanding goal of the SeaWiFS and MODIS (Ocean) Science Teams is to determine satellite-derived\nLWN(\xce\xbb) with a relative combined standard uncertainty1 of 5 % (Vol. I, Chapter 1). Other satellite ocean color\nprojects and the Sensor Intercomparison for Marine Biology and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS)\nproject have also adopted this goal, at least implicitly. Because water-leaving radiance contributes at most 10 % of\nthe total radiance measured by a satellite sensor above the atmosphere (Gordon 1997), a 5 % uncertainty in LWN(\xce\xbb)\nimplies a 0.5 % uncertainty in the above-atmosphere radiance measurements. This level of uncertainty can only be\napproached using \xe2\x80\x9cvicarious-calibration\xe2\x80\x9d approaches as described below. In practice, this means that the satellite\nradiance responsivity is adjusted to achieve the best agreement, in a least-squares sense, for the LWN(\xce\xbb) results\ndetermined using the satellite and the independent optical sensors (e.g. MOBY). The end result of this approach is\nto implicitly absorb unquantified, but systematic, errors in the atmospheric correction, incident solar flux, and\nsatellite sensor calibration into a single correction factor to produce consistency with the in situ data (see e.g.\nGordon 1981, 1987, 1988).\nClearly, the combined standard uncertainty of the in situ LWN(\xce\xbb) determinations must be less than 5 % if the\nstated uncertainty goal is to be approached. The uncertainty budget of MOBY LWN(\xce\xbb) determinations may be\ndivided into environmental and radiometric factors. Environmental factors include uncertainties due to radiance and\nirradiance fluctuations associated with surface waves and platform motions during the radiometric measurements,\nand with extrapolation of upwelling radiance measurements from depths of 1 m or more to, and through, the sea\nsurface. The uncertainties associated with these ambient conditions have been shown to be less than, but\napproaching, 5 % for upwelled radiance (Siegel et al. , 1995; Hooker and Maritorena, 2000). Radiometric\nuncertainty components associated with instrument characterization, calibration and stability, i.e. the radiance\n1\n\nAll uncertainties in this document are standard uncertainties, unless noted otherwise. Standard uncertainty is the\nuncertainty of the result of a measurement expressed as a standard deviation (Taylor and Kuyatt 1994).\n3\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nmeasurements per se, must be summed in quadrature to yield the combined standard uncertainty of the MOBY\nLWN(\xce\xbb) determinations.\nThe estimated combined standard uncertainty of MOBY radiance measurements is between 4 % and 8 % (Clark\net al. 2001). This estimate is based on uncertainties of MOBY calibrations at less than 3 %, changes in pre- and\npost-deployment calibrations ranging from 1 % to 6 %, radiometric stability tests during deployments using internal\nreference sources that show changes less than 1 %, and diver-deployed external reference lamp responses that are\nstable within less than 3 % (the estimated uncertainty of the method) (Clark et al. 2001). The 8 % upper limit on the\ncombined standard uncertainty estimate does not include preliminary results of recently undertaken stray light\ncharacterization of the MOBY spectrographs, which indicate systematic stray light offsets in LWN(\xce\xbb) may have\napproximate magnitudes of +5 % and -3 % at blue and green wavelengths respectively (Sects. 2.4 and 2.8 below,\nand Clark et al. 2001). Once the stray light characterization is completed on all MOBY spectrographs, the entire\nMOBY LWN(\xce\xbb) time series will be reprocessed with an expected combined standard uncertainty of less than 5 %.\nVariations in the measurement environment may add additional uncertainty.\nThe nature of, and data requirements for, vicarious calibration of a satellite ocean color sensor are briefly\ndescribed in Vol. I, Chapter 1 (Sect. 1.5), and in more detail by Gordon (1981, 1987, 1988, 1997), Gordon et al.\n(1983), Evans and Gordon (1994), and Clark et al. (1997). A critical element of the procedure is the ability to\nmonitor a satellite sensor\xe2\x80\x99s performance at daily to weekly intervals by comparing its derived LWN(\xce\xbb) with\nconcurrently derived in situ LWN(\xce\xbb) meeting the uncertainty criteria described above. The most direct way of\nmeasuring LWN(\xce\xbb) on a continuing daily basis over periods of several years is to utilize a specially designed array of\nradiometers mounted on a moored buoy. This buoy must be designed to mount the optical collectors well away\nfrom platform shading and reflections, artifacts similar to ship shadow, as discussed in Vol. III, Chapter 2 (Sect.\n2.2). To minimize uncertainties due to extrapolation of upwelling radiance Lu(z,\xce\xbb) to the sea surface, the buoy must\nbe moored at a location with consistently transparent case 1 waters and with negligible mesoscale to sub-mesoscale\nspatial variability. To assure frequent occurrences of matched satellite and buoy measurements, the site must be\ncloud free throughout most of the year. The mooring must be located close to an island based sun photometer and\nsky radiance sensor to allow concurrent determinations of aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance distribution.\nOn the other hand, the atmospheric conditions at the mooring location must not be significantly influenced by the\nisland\xe2\x80\x99s wake. Extraordinary calibration maintenance procedures are needed to assure low uncertainties in the\nbuoy\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric measurements. In addition, comparative shipboard measurements must be made near the buoy to\ncheck the radiometric stability of its instrumentation, to determine spatial variability surrounding the buoy location,\nand to develop and validate bio-optical algorithms. Some of these measurements can be made during cruises staged\nto replace the mooring at 3 to 4 month intervals, but dedicated cruises of 1 to 2 week duration are also required. The\nlogistical demands of buoy maintenance, calibration activities, deployment and relief, and ship support operations\nstrongly argue for placing the buoy conveniently near a permanent support facility. The locations of the MOBY\nmooring, near the island of Lanai, and the associated support facilities in Honolulu, Hawaii closely satisfy all of the\nabove conditions.\nThe radiometric measurements at a primary reference site for vicarious calibration of satellite ocean color\nsensors differ in several aspects from the radiometric in-water profiling methods described in the Vol. III, Chapter 2.\nA primary reference data set must consist of in situ determinations of band-averaged LWN(\xce\xbb)\xe2\x80\x99s that reproduce the\nspectral response functions of each satellite sensor\xe2\x80\x99s bands with more accuracy than can be realized using off the\nshelf radiometers. The need for flexibility in the choice of spectral response weighting functions used to determine\nband-averaged LWN(\xce\xbb) imposes a requirement for full-spectrum measurements with resolutions <1 nm. Instead of\nmeasuring radiometric profiles resolved at several samples per m (Vol. III, Chapter 2, Sect. 2.2), downwelling\nirradiance Ed(z,\xce\xbb) and upwelling radiance Lu(z,\xce\xbb) can be measured on a buoy at only a few fixed depths, which\ncomplicates the problem of accurately determining Lu(0 ,\xce\xbb) (just below the sea surface).\nTo be affordable, a moored array must typically be deployed and operated semi-autonomously for periods of 3\nto 4 months. Provisions to assure radiometric stability through these extended period operations should include, as a\nminimum, pre- and post-deployment calibrations of all radiometers, combined with continuous monitoring of onboard light sources of known stability. Moreover, instruments suspended in seawater for periods of this duration\nexperience fouling by biological organisms that, if not countered effectively using antifouling methods and frequent\ncleaning by divers, seriously degrade the performance of optical sensors. Affordable servicing and maintenance\n\n4\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nduring each deployment is limited to circa monthly visits by divers to clean instruments, check sensor calibrations\nagainst portable underwater lamp sources, and perform minimal maintenance.\nBecause of these uniquely different measurement requirements, platform related geometry, instrument\ncharacteristics, and operational conditions, the protocols applying to the MOBY instruments and methods of\nmeasurement and data analysis are presented separately in the present chapter. Where appropriate, certain protocols\nwill be defined and described by reference to other chapters. This chapter documents the protocols used by the\nMOBY Operations Team to measure and derive the MOBY data sets that consist of the LWN(\xce\xbb) time series. The\ninformation is intended as background for those wishing to apply this data to validate water-leaving radiances from\none or more satellite ocean color sensors.\n\n2.2 THE MOBY PRIMARY VICARIOUS CALIBRATION SITE\nThe primary components of the MOBY vicarious calibration site are located as shown in Fig. 2.1. A MOBY is\ncontinuously moored approximately 20 km west of the island of Lanai in 1200 m of water. During prevailing trade\nwind conditions, this location is sheltered in the lee of the island, yet it is far enough offshore to minimize\natmospheric perturbations associated with the island\xe2\x80\x99s wake. CIMEL2 sun photometers on Lanai and Oahu,\noperated by the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Project (Vol. II, Chapter 4 and Vol. III, Chapter 5), provide\ntime series measurements of aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance distributions that are required to reduce the\nuncertainty budgets of atmospheric correction models used during vicarious calibration analyses. The MOBY\nOperation Site, located at the University of Hawaii (UH) Marine Facility in Honolulu, is staffed full time by\npersonnel from the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML) for buoy maintenance, instrument maintenance and\ncalibration, and for staging buoy relief and bio-optical sampling cruises. The UH\xe2\x80\x99s research vessels are used for\ncruises to support buoy deployments (L-series cruises identified in Table 2.1), Marine Optical Characterization\nExperiments (MOCE-series), and interim maintenance and quality control operations. During the MOCE and some\nL-series cruises (Table 2.1), in situ bio-optical measurements are made to validate MOBY LWN(\xce\xbb) determinations, to\ncharacterize spatial variability near the mooring, and to develop and validate bio-optical algorithms. A subset of the\nMOBY data is transmitted, in real time via cellular telephone, to the MLML in California. The MOBY data are\nprocessed at MLML to produce and extract appropriately weighted band-averaged LWN(\xce\xbb)\xe2\x80\x99s for SIMBIOS and\nSeaWiFS Project Offices at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight\nCenter (GSFC), and/or to the MODIS Team at the University of Miami.\nMOBY and the Marine Optical System (MOS)\nMOBY is a 12 m spar buoy (including the lower instrument bay) uniquely designed as an optical bench for\nmeasurements of Ed(z,\xce\xbb) and Lu(z,\xce\xbb) at depths of 1 m, 5 m, 9 m, and 12 m (Fig. 2.2). The features of MOBY are\nsummarized in Table 2.2. Fig. 2.3 is a schematic illustration of the MOBY system\xe2\x80\x99s sensors, operations and\ncommunications, while the mechanical layouts of the upper and lower instrument bays are illustrated in Fig. 2.4 and\nFig. 2.5, respectively. The MOBY spar is tethered to a second surface buoy, which is slack moored, i.e. isolated by\nsubsurface floats, to an anchor on the sea floor (Fig. 2.6). Sensors for wind speed, wind direction, air temperature,\nrelative humidity, and barometric pressure are mounted on the main mooring buoy.\nThe Marine Optical System (MOS), the heart of MOBY, consists of two single-grating CCD spectrographs\nconnected via an optical multiplexer and fiber optic cables to the Ed(z,\xce\xbb) and Lu(z,\xce\xbb) optical heads mounted at the\nends of the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s 3 standoff arms (Fig. 2.2 and Fig. 2.3). To provide low-loss transmission at ultraviolet\nwavelengths, 1 mm diameter silica fiber-optic cables are used to connect the optical heads to MOS. Lu(12,\xce\xbb), at z =\n12 m, is measured through a window in the bottom of the MOS housing itself. A seventh fiber optic cable connects\na surface irradiance Es(\xce\xbb) cosine collector, mounted at the top of the MOBY above-water mast, to the spectrographs.\nEach pair of in-water optical heads is mounted on a standoff arm to minimize radiometric artifacts due to shadows or\n\n2\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this document to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n5\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nreflections from the buoy. To minimize self-shading by the Lu(z,\xce\xbb) radiometer (Vol. III, Chapter 2, Sect. 2.4;\nGordon and Ding 1992), the underwater housings for the optical heads are very small in diameter (7 cm).\n\nFigure 2.1: Chart showing locations of the MOBY mooring, the two CIMEL robotic sun\nphotometers on Oahu and Lanai, cell phone relay stations used for data communications,\nand the MOBY Operations Site in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nThe principal characteristics of MOS are summarized in Table 2.3. The MOS system elements and optical\nlayout are illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8, respectively. Light from an Lu(z,\xce\xbb), Ed(z,\xce\xbb), or Es(\xce\xbb)\nhead enters the spectrograph package via its fiber optic cable and the multiplexer, is directed to a dichroic mirror\nthat reflects light at wavelengths between 350 nm and 630 nm into one (blue) grating spectrograph, and transmits\nwavelengths greater than 630 nm to the other (red) spectrograph. The MOS spectrograph package is mounted in\nMOBY\xe2\x80\x99s lower instrument bay (Fig. 2.5), at a depth of approximately 12 m, primarily to isolate the package from\nthe shock and vibration that surface waves inflict on the upper instrument bay. The deeper location also facilitates\nheat dissipation from the thermoelectric coolers used to maintain the operating temperature of the CCD arrays, and\nLu(12,\xce\xbb) may be measured through the MOS optical window at the very bottom of the MOBY spar. Even more\ncritically, the high current draw of the MOS requires that it be located close to the batteries, which themselves must\nbe placed at the bottom of the spar to act as stabilizing ballast.\nThe elements defining the spectral radiometric characteristics of each of the spectrographs are the entrance slit,\nholographic grating, and cooled CCD detector array (Fig. 2.8). For the blue spectrograph (350 nm to 630 nm), the\nfull-width at half-maximum (FWHM) bandpass of the spectral slit response function centered at any given\nwavelength is approximately 2 nm, and the 512 element detector array is designed to sample at approximately a\n0.6 nm interval. The MOS was designed with such high spectral resolution to support vicarious calibrations of a\nvariety of different satellite ocean color sensors (Appendix A). By measuring in situ spectra of Lu(\xce\xbb,z) at this\n\n6\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.2: The Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY).\n\n7\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nresolution, it is practical to compute band-averaged values of LWN(\xce\xbb) that are appropriately weighted for any of these\nsatellite ocean color sensors.\n\nFigure 2.3: A schematic overview of the MOBY system elements.\n\nAncillary Measurements on MOBY\nThe principal navigation (latitude and longitude) and UTC (Universal Time, Coordinated) clock reference are\ndetermined from the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver mounted in the MOBY upper instrument bay\n(Fig. 2.3 and Table 2.2). A secondary navigational position is provided by the System ARGOS transmitter, which is\nalso installed in the upper bay (Fig. 2.3) and provides frequent MOBY position updates as a precaution against\nlosing the buoy should the mooring fail. On two occasions, in fact, the MOBY array did break away from its\nmoorings and was recovered safely thanks to the ARGOS tracking capability. Additional ancillary sensors are\ninstalled in the MOS package:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInternal housing and CCD array temperatures are measured as indicators of performance quality, and may\nbe used in applying radiometric calibration factors to the data.\n\n8\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.4: The MOBY flotation and upper instrument bay assembly.\n\nFigure 2.5: A schematic diagram illustrating the mechanical layout of the subsurface instrument and\nbattery bay on MOBY.\n\n9\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA high precision pressure transducer is installed on the top radiometric arm (Fig. 2.2) to determine depth\nvariations [z(t) - zP] about its nominal reference depth zP (fixed by its location on the spar) during each\nradiometric measurement sequence. A separate temperature sensor monitors the temperature of the\npressure transducer, to minimize uncertainties in the depth determinations.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTilt sensors within the MOS package are used to determine the 2-axis orientation (pitch and yaw) of the\nMOBY spar relative to the local vertical. A flux gate compass, also installed within the MOS package, is\nused to determine the direction (magnetic) in which the radiometric sensor arms extend out from the spar.\nThe relative angle between the spar pointing azimuth and the solar azimuth are used to detect measurement\ngeometries in which the irradiance and radiance collectors may be influenced by shadows, or reflections,\nfrom the main MOBY structure.\n\nMooring Buoy Measurements\nSensors mounted on the mast of the mooring buoy measure wind velocity, surface barometric pressure, air\ntemperature, and relative humidity (Fig. 2.6). Also, near surface sensors on this buoy measure water temperature\nand conductivity, and chlorophyll a fluorescence.\nData Communications\nData from the MOS and other sensors mounted on MOBY are assembled into data records, and annotated with\ntime, latitude and longitude as based on GPS input, by the Tattletale2 (Model TT7) microcomputer installed in the\nupper instrument bay (Table 2.2, Fig. 2.3 and Fig. 2.4). Data records are stored on hard disk for download when the\nMOBY is recovered and replaced at the end of a deployment. The microcomputer also transmits the data records\nover the cellular phone link to MLML in California. Normally, 99 % of the data are recovered via telemetry. Data\nfrom the meteorological sensors on the mooring buoy are similarly processed autonomously by a microcomputer.\nAll data records are stored on hard disk and are downloaded once daily.\n\n2.3 MOBY OPERATIONS AND MEASUREMENT METHODS\nDeployment Schedule and Methods\nThere are two complete MOBY systems, one of which is moored and operational at any given time. The\nhistory of MOBY deployments, and key events associated with each, are summarized in Table 2.4. The typical\nduration of a single mooring deployment is between 3 and 4 months. During this period, the other MOBY is\nmaintained and refurbished and its MOS recalibrated. At approximately monthly intervals during a deployment, the\nOperations Team visits the MOBY mooring site using a small boat launched from the island of Maui. During these\ninterim visits, divers clean the optical collectors and use a specially designed underwater lamp reference source to\ncheck the radiometric stability of the deployed MOS (Sect. 2.4). During these \xe2\x80\x9cinterim-servicing\xe2\x80\x9d cruises, water\nsamples are filtered for phytoplankton pigment analyses, for comparison with pigment concentration determinations\nusing the MOBY radiometric measurements. These pigment concentration comparisons are made to validate the\npigment algorithms associated with the various satellite ocean color sensors.\nWhen the time comes to exchange the MOBY systems, the replacement buoy is loaded aboard a research vessel and\ntransported to the mooring site. On arriving at the site, the recalibrated and refurbished replacement MOBY is first\ndeployed and set adrift (Fig. 2.9). Divers release the tether connecting the moored MOBY to the mooring buoy.\nThe replacement buoy is then towed into position by the divers (operating from a support boat) and connected to the\nmooring. When possible, in-water radiometric measurements are made with both MOBY systems as a final check\non the stability of the recovered system. Finally, the recovered MOBY is secured aboard the ship for its return to the\nMOBY Operations Site in Honolulu. The entire mooring (Fig. 2.6) is replaced at approximately 1-year intervals\n(Table 2.4). On these occasions, the acoustic release (Fig. 2.6) is activated to free the mooring line and its flotation\nfrom its anchor. A new anchor and surface mooring buoy are deployed, and a MOBY is tethered to it.\n\n10\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.6: The MOBY mooring configuration.\n\nMOCE and Other Validation Shipboard Operations\nOn some of the MOBY replacement cruises (\xe2\x80\x9cL-cruises\xe2\x80\x9d in Table 2.1), additional ship time is used to make\n\xe2\x80\x9cRequired\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHighly Desired\xe2\x80\x9d radiometric and bio-optical measurements (Vol. I, Chapter 3, Table 3.1), both for\nradiometric validation of the MOBY and satellite ocean color sensor measurements, and for algorithm development\nand validation.\nComplementing the MOBY project are the MOCE cruises, which are carried out primarily to support vicarious\ncalibration and validation of satellite ocean color sensors. The MOCE team is comprised of scientists from the\n\n11\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.7: A schematic diagram of the MOS functional elements.\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service\n(NOAA/NESDIS), MLML, San Diego State University, and the University of Miami (Florida). MOCE cruises,\nwhich are typically between 10 and 30 days in duration, have been conducted in the general vicinity of the MOBY\nsite and off the west coast of North America (Table 2.1).\nMeasurements acquired during the MOCE cruises are generally more extensive than those made during the \xe2\x80\x9cLcruises\xe2\x80\x9d. As an example, measurements made during MOCE-5 are listed in Table 2.5, which includes all of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cRequired\xe2\x80\x9d, nearly all of the \xe2\x80\x9cHighly Desired\xe2\x80\x9d and some of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpecialized Measurements\xe2\x80\x9d categories of variables\nlisted in Table 3.1 (Vol. I, Chapter 3). Protocols for most of these measurements and analyses conform to those\ndescribed elsewhere in this document. However, protocols are not provided elsewhere for two of the specialized\nmeasurements listed in Table 2.5, \xe2\x80\x9cInstrument Self-Shading\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cParticle Size Distribution\xe2\x80\x9d, nor are measurements\nof these variables identified in Vol. I, Chapter 3.\nThe effects of instrument self-shading on upwelling radiance and irradiance measurements are discussed briefly,\nand provisional protocols (based on Gordon and Ding 1992) for removing self-shading effects from measurements\nare described in Vol. III, Chapter 2 (Sect. 2.4). Direct measurements of the self-shading phenomenon are made\nduring MOCE cruises (Table 2.5) to test the predictions of Gordon and Ding (1992) and determine relative\nuncertainties under a variety of ambient illumination conditions. A Fiber Optic Spectrometer (FOS) was developed\nusing two modified American Holographic AH4000 series dual-beam spectrometers, one configured for radiometric\nmeasurements spanning the wavelength range from 375 nm to 725 nm at 5 nm resolution, and the other from\n600 nm to 1100 nm at 10 nm resolution. The spectrometers are placed in a pressure housing and are coupled by\nfiber-optic leads to upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance collectors that are located approximately 1 m\naway to minimize shading and reflection effects. The upwelling radiance probe is ~5 cm in diameter, and the selfshading effect is varied by attaching discs of increasing diameter to it.\nParticle size distributions are measured using a commercial (Spectrex) laser particle counter. Particle counts,\nbinned by size, are determined by measuring the magnitude of reflections from particles in a small working volume\n\n12\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nof water illuminated by a Helium-Neon diode (670.8 nm) LASER. The working volume, which is embedded in a\n100 ml water sample, and its geometry are defined by the optical elements of the instrument. The water sample is\nagitated with a magnetic stirrer to keep particles in suspension during the measurements. The protocols used for\ndetermining particle size distributions are those provided by the manufacturer of the Spectrex, which claim to\nresolve particle sizes as small as 1 \xc2\xb5m. On the other hand, the assumptions underlying the method are that the\nindividual particles are separated by distances large compared to the wavelength of illumination, and that particle\ndiameters are at least 5 times larger than the wavelength, so that particle reflection is governed by geometric optics.\nOther investigators have used the Spectrex instrument to measure particle size distributions, but a community\nconsensus has yet to be developed for protocols related to this measurement and its interpretation.\n\nFigure 2.8: A schematic diagram showing the optical design of the MOS spectrographs.\nMOBY System Operations Scheduling\nMOBY data collection is programmed at the MOBY Operations Site in Honolulu, prior to each deployment.\nAfter the buoy has been deployed, any necessary program changes are made using a direct connection to the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s\non-board computer. The on-board computer is programmed to acquire data during each event when the mooring site\nis in view of a satellite ocean color sensor. Currently, the MOBY radiometric measurement sequence, described\nbelow, is executed twice daily, coincident with the predicted overpasses of SeaWiFS and MODIS.\nRadiometric Measurements\nThe MOS measures radiation input from one Lu(z,\xce\xbb), Ed(z,\xce\xbb) or Es(\xce\xbb) head at a time. The desired channel is\nselected by the optical multiplexer. A rotating mirror within the MOS selects alternatively the input from the\nmultiplexer, a dark reference calibration, light emitting diodes (LEDs), or a tungsten halogen incandescent lamp\n(Table 2.3). Integration times for the radiance collector on the top arm, at 1 m, typically range from 1 s to 4 s for the\nblue spectrograph and 10 s to 30 s for the red spectrograph. A typical sequence would be to measure Lu(\xce\xbb,z) from a\ndepth, preceded and followed by Es(\xce\xbb) surface reference spectra and associated dark spectra. Then this sequence is\nrepeated at the 2nd and 3rd depths to complete the profile for Lu(\xce\xbb,z), as summarized in the example of\n\n13\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.9: Deployment of a MOBY.\n\nFigure 2.10: MOBY radiometric calibration and system stability check flow chart.\n\n14\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nTable 2.6. Note that there are a total of 35 measurements for radiances at the 3 depths, surface irradiance Es(\xce\xbb) and\nsensor dark spectra. The 35 measurements are grouped into overlapping subsets of 15 measurements, representing\nthe cycle associated with upwelled radiance measurements at each depth. Not included in the example are\nmeasurements from the base of the MOS itself, because these data are not currently used to determine water-leaving\nradiance. This entire procedure requires between 30 min and 1 hr to complete.\n\nFigure 2.11: The diver-deployed underwater radiometric stability reference unit attached to an upwelling\nradiance collector on MOBY.\nMethods for Mitigating Bio-Fouling\nMarine organisms, including algae and barnacles, typically attach themselves to any surface that is immersed in\nseawater for an extended period. This \xe2\x80\x9cbio-fouling\xe2\x80\x9d process changes the transmittance of the radiance windows and\nirradiance cosine diffusers. The radiance windows are placed at the base of copper tubes, and small amounts of\nbromide are slowly released near the windows throughout the deployment. Both of these substances are poisons for\nmost marine life. It is not practical to use this approach with the irradiance collectors, so a combination of Teflon\ncollector material, copper bezels and less effective anti-fouling compounds is used here. Divers clean the optical\ncollectors and recharge the bromide dispensers at monthly intervals during each deployment.\nAncillary Measurements\nAboard the mooring buoy, the meteorological state variables (wind velocity, surface pressure, air temperature\nand humidity), sea surface temperature and conductivity, and near-surface in situ chlorophyll a fluorescence, are\nsampled as 5 min averages at 15 min intervals, and recorded continuously on the system disk. The data records are\ndownloaded once daily.\n\n15\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nSun Photometer and Sky Radiance Measurements (on Lanai and Oahu)\nThe AERONET Project at NASA GSFC operates the CIMEL1 sun photometers on Lanai and Oahu, and\nretrieves the data, remotely. The aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance distribution data measured at these sites\nare needed as input to atmospheric correction models when the MOBY water leaving radiances are used for\nvicarious calibration of the satellite ocean color sensor. The data are archived by, and may be obtained from, the\nAERONET Project at NASA GSFC. MOBY support personnel visit the photometer sites at monthly intervals to\ncheck and clean the instruments.\n\n2.4 CALIBRATION AND QUALITY CONTROL\nThe MOBY radiometers are characterized and calibrated using procedures that conform to the protocols\ndescribed in Vol. II, Chapter 3. The unique role of MOBY as a primary, long term, and daily reference for vicarious\ncalibration of satellite ocean color sensors requires radiometric measurements of the highest possible quality, and\nthis in turn places stringent demands on the methods of traceability to NIST radiometric standards. For example, the\nMOBY team uses exclusively irradiance standards acquired directly from NIST, NIST recalibrates these sources\nfrequently (see below), and NIST investigators validate the team\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric sources at annual intervals.\nThe MOS radiometers are calibrated before and after each deployment, and stability tests are made during\ndeployments using both on-board and diver-deployed sources. These calibrations, tests and comparative\nmeasurements are illustrated schematically in Figure 2.10. The special aspects of the MOBY radiometric\ncalibration, characterization and stability test procedures are described in this section.\nRadiometric Calibration and Characterization of MOS\nThe spectral irradiance responsivities of the MOS Ed(z,\xce\xbb) and Es(\xce\xbb) channels are calibrated using FEL-type\nlamp standards of spectral irradiance, and the Lu(z,\xce\xbb) channels are calibrated using lamp-illuminated integrating\nsphere sources. The wavelength calibration is performed using spectral line emission lamps, and every calibration\ncycle includes a measure of three internal sources (see below). Each instrument, whether for a MOCE or for a\nMOBY deployment, is calibrated at the support facility site in Honolulu before and after the in-water deployment.\nThe standards of spectral irradiance and radiance are recalibrated every 50 h of operation. The irradiance standards,\n1000 W quartz-halogen lamps (model number FEL), are calibrated by NIST. The integrating sphere source radiance\nstandards are calibrated by their manufacturer, Optronic Laboratories, Inc. The MOS irradiance responsivity\nassignments are NIST-traceable using the NIST-issued FEL lamps. During the MOS irradiance calibration, the\nlamps are operated at the correct current using a calibrated shunt resistor in series with the lamp. The lamp is\noperated in an enclosed housing at the same distance and with the same collection area as at NIST (50 cm and 1 cm2,\nrespectively). A reference mounting plate ensures the alignment of the lamp to the irradiance collector. The validity\nof this approach was verified by NIST (Mueller et al. 1996).\nThe radiance assignment is NIST-traceable via the commercial standards laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s calibration of integrating\nsphere sources (ISSs). Two ISSs are used: model OL420 and model OL425. They are externally illuminated, with\nan aperture wheel to vary the radiant output in discrete amounts. However, the two ISS units differ in the designs of\ntheir internal baffles, and in the method used by each to continuously vary the output. The ISSs are operated at\nconstant current. The OL425 has, additionally, an internal illuminance monitor detector that is used to relate the\noutput to that during the calibration measurements at Optronic Laboratories. The ISSs are re-lamped by Optronic\nLaboratories, and calibrated before and after this procedure, so for each sphere and lamp configuration, there is an\ninitial and a final radiometric calibration; to date, only the initial calibration values have been used for the MOBY\ncalibrations.\nIn addition to the routine calibration of the MOBY radiometric standards, two single-channel, dual-mode\nradiometers were designed and built by NIST to verify the calibrations of the FELs and ISSs and to monitor their\nstability at the support facility site in Honolulu. These Standard Lamp Monitors (SLMs) (Clark et al. 2001) have\ninterchangeable foreoptics for operation in either radiance or irradiance mode. The narrowband (approximately\n10 nm bandwidth) interference filters are centered at 412 nm and 872 nm. During every radiometric calibration at\nthe support site, the SLMs are used to record the output of the radiometric standards. The absolute radiometric\n\n16\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nresponse of the SLMs is determined by measurements at NIST, both during the initial development and\nsubsequently on an interval of 12 months to 18 months.\nFinally, site visits by NIST personnel are done at regular intervals, and radiance comparisons are performed.\nInitially, the SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer (SXR), a multichannel filter radiometer (Johnson et al. 1998) that is\ncalibrated at NIST, was used. At the present time, a later version of the SXR, the Visible Transfer Radiometer\n(VXR) (Johnson et al. 2002) is used, along with a stable, portable, NIST-calibrated ISS, the NIST Portable Radiance\nSource (NPR) (Brown and Johnson 2002). The VXR and the NPR were developed by NIST in support of the\ncalibration program for the Earth Observing System (EOS) (Butler et al. 1999).\nMOS Internal Reference Sources\nAn internal reference system was incorporated into the MOS design to monitor the stability of the radiometric\ndetectors, electronics, and internal optics. These measurements are critical for establishing confidence in the\nobservations acquired during a deployment cycle. One of the viewing positions on the main relay mirror mechanism\nreflects light from a Spectralon1 diffuser plate into the blue and red spectrograph optical relays. The diffuser is\nilluminated in sequence by an incandescent lamp, a blue light emitting diode (LED), and a red LED. The blue and\nred diodes are centered at 465 nm and 705 nm, respectively, with approximately 100 nm bandwidths. The lamps are\nrun with current controlled circuitry and the temperature of the lamp holder block is monitored. These lamps are\nobserved at the end of each MOBY data acquisition set (Sect. 2.3). Time histories of reference lamp responses for\neach deployment period show the MOS spectrograph responses to be stable at the 1 % level.\nField Tests of Radiometric Stability Using Diver Deployed Sources\nThe internal reference lamp and diodes responses (above) do not reflect changes in the throughput of the MOS\nirradiance and radiance collectors due to bio-fouling. During the nominal three-month duration of a MOBY system\ndeployment period, a team of divers conducts inspections, external reference lamp stability tests, and cleaning\nmonthly. During these maintenance operations, the near-surface components of the moored buoy and MOBY are\ninspected for damage, deterioration, and bio-fouling. The condition of the buoy is documented with underwater\nphotography. To document these effects on MOBY radiometry, external underwater reference lamp stability\nbaseline measurements are conducted on each irradiance, or radiance, collector immediately after the MOBY is\ndeployed (Fig. 2.11). The underwater reference lamp radiometric stability tests are repeated during each monthly\nservice visit, before and after each collector is cleaned. The reference lamp system is a modified commercial\nunderwater unit using a 35 W incandescent lamp. The lamp is powered by a submersible, 12 V, 6.5 A h batterypack. Modifications to the commercial lamp system included the addition of constant current circuitry to the battery\npack, and construction of lamp housings that fit over the radiance and irradiance collectors to block ambient light,\nwhile maintaining a fixed distance between the lamp source and collector. The radiance reference lamp system has\na translucent diffuser placed between the lamp and collector window. Laboratory stability tests of the reference\nlamp systems show the output to be repeatable within 1 % if the battery voltage remains within 25 % of full charge.\nIn the field, batteries are replaced and recharged when voltage decreases to 50 % of full charge.\nExamples of the diver reference lamp responses for a few wavelengths at one upwelling radiance collector are\nillustrated in Fig. 2.12. Data shown at each wavelength represent the difference between the MOS responses on 3\nAugust 2000, when the MOBY was deployed, and the responses before and after cleaning on 4 October 2000. The\nvertical bars illustrate the standard uncertainty in the diver reference lamp comparisons. Because all the response\nmeasurements fall within this uncertainty, the diver lamp response data have not been used to correct for trends\nduring a deployment.\nWavelength Stability Tests Using Fraunhofer Lines\nSolar Fraunhofer lines and the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s oxygen A band absorption near 762 nm are resolved in the MOS\nEs(\xce\xbb) spectra. The MOS detector array pixel locations of these lines are used to monitor the wavelength stability of\nthe system throughout each deployment. Within the spectral resolution of the MOS spectrographs, no changes in the\nlocations of any of these bands have occurred since the first MOBY deployment.\n\n17\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.12: An example showing results of diver-deployed underwater radiometric stability source tests\nfor several wavelengths and one radiance collector. The measurements were made immediately before, and\nafter, the diver cleaned the radiance collector. The data are charted as percent differences from the similar\ntest done on the day the buoy was deployed, approximately 2 months earlier.\n\nStray Light Characterization\nA critical issue in ocean color measurements arises because of the large difference in the relative spectral shape\nof the lamp-illuminated ISS (radiance mode), or the FEL lamp (irradiance mode), when compared to the relative\nspectral shape of Lu(z,\xce\xbb), or Ed(z,\xce\xbb), measured in the ocean. Radiometric sensors do not have an ideal spectral\nselectivity, i.e., the response at a wavelength of interest to flux at other wavelengths is small but finite (Vol. II,\nChapter 2, Sect. 2.2 and Vol. II, Chapter 3, Sect. 3.4). As a result, measurements at the wavelength of interest\ninclude both a component that is proportional to the flux at that wavelength (e.g., the \xe2\x80\x9cin-band\xe2\x80\x9d component) plus a\ncomponent that sums the product of the sensor response and the spectrum of flux at wavelengths outside the in-band\nregion. The latter sum, representing the out-of-band component, must be evaluated for all wavelengths for which\nthe detector has finite responsivity. For MOS, the out-of-band response is largely determined by the scattering\nproperties of the grating and unwanted reflections of flux diffracted in second order. We refer to the effect as \xe2\x80\x9cstray\nlight\xe2\x80\x9d.\nStray light considerations for MOS motivated dividing the spectrum into two regions using a dichroic\nbeamsplitter and two spectrographs. As seen by the blue spectrograph, this division results in a better match\nbetween the spectral shapes of the FEL-type spectral irradiance sources and Ed(z,\xce\xbb), or the ISSs and Lu(z,\xce\xbb), and\nminimizes stray light effects in the critical ocean color wavelength bands. At 412 nm and 440 nm, for example,\ncomparisons of Lu(z,\xce\xbb) for MOCE or MOBY deployments agree with measurements using independent filter\nradiometers to within \xc2\xb15 %.\nThe effect of stray light in MOS is most evident in the region of overlap between the two spectrographs, from\n545 nm to 650 nm. For the red spectrograph, the decreased transmittance of the dichroic beamsplitter in this region,\nwhere it goes from zero to nearly unity transmittance, means that the ratio of the in-band to the out-of-band\ncomponents is unfavorable. Indeed, for some MOS wavelengths (CCD columns) at the blue side of the red\n\n18\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nspectrograph, the recorded signals can be dominated by the out-of-band component. At the present time, the\nprocessing algorithms use the results from the blue spectrograph up to 620 nm, and those from the red spectrograph\nbeyond 620 nm. The differences are generally stable in time and depend on depth, another indication that the effect\nis related to source spectral shape.\nTo correct for stray light, the function that describes the sensitivity to flux at wavelengths other than the desired\nwavelength must be determined. This requires a tunable, monochromatic source that fills the entrance pupil of the\nsensor. Improvements in technology and the recent addition of new facilities at NIST have made it possible to\nfully characterize sensors such as CCD spectrographs using fully tunable laser-illuminated, integrating sphere\nsources (Brown, Eppeldauer, and Lykke 2000). The facility is called Spectral Irradiance and Radiance responsivity\nCalibrations with Uniform Sources (SIRCUS).\nA thorough stray light characterization study for the MOBY project was begun in early 2000. Work started on\nSIRCUS with a MOS bench unit (Habauzit et al. 2002), and continued with the full characterization of MOS202\n(which is used as a profiler instrument). Measurements are ongoing for the MOBY MOS units. The SIRCUS\nmeasurements yield the absolute radiance response of the sensors. Examples of the response of a single column in\nthe blue spectrograph (column 380), and of the red spectrograph (column 277), are shown in Fig. 2.13 and Fig. 2.14\nfor the MOS profiler. The small peak near 510 nm for the blue spectrograph is caused by flux diffracted in second\norder and reflected onto the CCD by the grating and the second spherical mirror.\n\nFigure 2.13: An example of the wavelength dependent spectral stray light responsivity of one CCD pixel\nlocation (wavelength) for the MOS blue spectrograph.\nA stray light correction algorithm was developed that is based on determination of the in-band region for one\ncolumn on each CCD spectrograph, a description of the shape of the out-of-band response, and a model to account\nfor the effects of the second order \xe2\x80\x9creflection peak\xe2\x80\x9d (Brown et al 2002). To date, the SIRCUS results for the MOS\nprofiler have been used to implement a preliminary version of the stray light correction algorithm, and test\napplications to the MOCE5 data sets are extremely encouraging. These preliminary results indicate that stray light\naffected the MOS Profiler results during MOCE 5 by up to +5 % at 412 nm (the uncorrected radiances are too small)\nand up to -1.5 % at 546 nm (the uncorrected radiances are too large).\n\n19\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.14: Same as Figure 2.13, but for one CCD pixel of the MOS red spectrograph.\nValidation of the stray light correction algorithm is accomplished using an ISS that is made to simulate the\nspectral shape of in-water radiances using colored glass filters. The radiance of this colored source is determined\nindependently by a NIST calibrated double grating monochromator. The results are compared to the corrected and\nuncorrected MOBY values and used to estimate the uncertainty of the stray-light correction. MOS stray light\ncorrections are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 of the present Volume.\nCIMEL Sun Photometer and Sky Radiance Sensor Calibrations\nThe CIMEL instruments deployed at the stations on Oahu and Lanai are calibrated and maintained at NASA\nGSFC by the SIMBIOS Project Office, in collaboration with AERONET Project, following the procedures\ndescribed in Volume II, Chapter 4.\n\n2.5 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS\nAs described above in Sect. 2.3, a single MOBY observation comprises a sequence of four to seven spectral\nradiance and irradiance measurement cycles for optical collectors located at the different depths on the spar (Table\n2.6). The portion of the data record for an individual measurement cycle, e.g. for the upwelling radiance collector\non a MOBY arm at depth zi, is recorded as 3 arrays of digital counts CLi(\xcf\x84,Np,zi,tm,\xce\xbb) [m = 7, 8, 9 in an Lu(zi,\xce\xbb)\nth\ncycle of Table 2.6], where tm is the time of the m measurement and \xcf\x84 is integration time. The \xe2\x80\x9cbin factor\xe2\x80\x9d Np is\nexpressed as the number of CCD rows read into the output register during each read step. Preceding and following\neach set of 3 radiance count arrays CLi(\xcf\x84,zi,tm,\xce\xbb), the data record for one measurement cycle contains digital count\narrays for incident surface irradiance (above water on the MOBY mast) Cs(\xcf\x84sm,tm,Npdm,\xce\xbb), [m = 2, 3 4 (pre) and\nm = 12, 13, 14 (post) (Table 2.6)], and the MOS system dark response D(\xcf\x84dm,tm,Npdm,\xce\xbb), for Es [m = 1 and 5 (pre)\n\n20\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nand m = 11 and 15 (post)] and Lu [m = 6 and 10]. The central time, tLi [or tEi], associated with a single radiance [or\nirradiance] measurement cycle (Table 2.6) is calculated as, e.g.\ntLi =\n\n1 15\n\xe2\x88\x91 ti .\n15 i =1\n\n(2.1)\n\nTemporal Averaging\nThe first step in processing the data is to scale each digital count array to unit integration time and average the\nindividual measurements. Average counts for surface irradiance, normalized to unit integration time and bin factor,\nare computed as\nCs ( tLi , \xce\xbb ) =\n\n1 \xef\xa3\xae Cs (\xcf\x84 s,i , tm , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xba, m = 2,3, 4,12,13,14 (Table 2.6)\n\xe2\x88\x91\xef\xa3\xaf\n6 m \xef\xa3\xaf N p,s,i\xcf\x84 s,i \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(2.2)\n\nAverage counts for MOS Lu Dark response, normalized to unit integration time and bin factor, are computed as\n(Lu cycle indices as in Table 2.6)\nD ( tLi , \xce\xbb ) =\n\n1 \xef\xa3\xae D (\xcf\x84 d,6 , t6 , \xce\xbb ) D (\xcf\x84 d,10 , t10 , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n+\n\xef\xa3\xaf\n\xef\xa3\xba.\n2 \xef\xa3\xaf N p,d,6\xcf\x84 d,6\nN p,d,10\xcf\x84 d,10 \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe 4 ES Darks for the associated surface reference are averaged similarly. Finally, the average counts for the cycle\nof upwelled radiance measurements, normalized to unit integration time and bin factor, are computed as\nCLi ( zi , tLi , \xce\xbb ) =\n\n9\n\n1\n3N p\xcf\x84\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 C (\xcf\x84 , z , t\nLi\n\nm=7\n\ni\n\nm\n\n, \xce\xbb ).\n\n(2.4)\n\nWith appropriate changes in subscripts (i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cEi\xe2\x80\x9d in place of \xe2\x80\x9cLi\xe2\x80\x9d), equations (2.1) through (2.4) apply also to a\nspectral downwelling irradiance measurement cycle at depth zi.\nSystem Spectral Response Functions\nThe MOS system spectral radiance (or irradiance) responsivity functions Rj(\xce\xbb, \xcf\x84), for optical collector j and unit\nintegration time (i.e. \xcf\x84 = 1), are determined following procedures described in Vol. II, Ch. 3 (Sect. 3.2), with\nextensions described above in Sect. 2.4.

In equation (2.6), \xe2\x80\x9cLi\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the subscripted\n(or superscripted) quantity applies to the spectral radiance collector mounted at depth zi on the MOBY frame.\nEquation (2.6), substituting appropriate variables and subscripts, applies also to downwelling spectral irradiance\n-2\n\n-1\n\nEd(zi,tEi,\xce\xbb) [\xc2\xb5W cm nm ] measurements using the irradiance collector mounted on MOBY at depth zi.\nMeasurement Depths\nOn MOBY, Lu(z,\xce\xbb) is measured at 4 depths that are rigidly separated at fixed intervals on the buoy. These\ndepths are nominally z1 = 1 m, z2 = 5 m, z3 = 9 m, and z4 = 2.5 m. The radiance measurement at 2.5 m is not\ncurrently used to determine water-leaving radiance. Ed(z,\xce\xbb) is measured only at nominal depths z1 , z2 , and z3 .\n\n21\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nK(\xce\xbb) Analysis\nFollowing the above processing through equation (2.6), the attenuation coefficient for Lu(z,\xce\xbb) is computed from\nmeasurements at two discrete depths zi and zj as\nK L ( zij , \xce\xbb ) =\n\n\xef\xa3\xab Lu ( zi , \xce\xbb ) Es ( t j , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb6\n1\n\xef\xa3\xb7 , z j > zi , i = 1, 2,3, j = 2,3, 4,\nln \xef\xa3\xac\nz j \xe2\x88\x92 zi \xef\xa3\xac Lu ( z j , \xce\xbb ) Es ( ti , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb7\n\xef\xa3\xad\n\xef\xa3\xb8\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere ti and tj are the times of radiance measurements at depths zi and zj, respectively.

The mean depth in the interval between zi and zj is\nzij =\n\nzi + z j\n2\n\n(2.8)\n\n.\n\nThe diffuse attenuation coefficient for Ed(z,\xce\xbb) is computed similarly to (2.7) as\n\xef\xa3\xab Ed ( zi , \xce\xbb ) Es ( t j , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb6\n1\n\xef\xa3\xb7 , z j > zi , i = 1, 2, j = 2,3.\nln \xef\xa3\xac\n(2.9)\nz j \xe2\x88\x92 zi \xef\xa3\xac Ed ( z j , \xce\xbb ) Es ( ti , \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb7\n\xef\xa3\xad\n\xef\xa3\xb8\nFor computing K L ( zij , \xce\xbb ) and K d ( zij , \xce\xbb ) from data measured with the shipboard MOS instrument, the actual\nK d ( zij , \xce\xbb ) =\n\ndepths zi are determined to the nearest cm using data from its high precision depth transducer.\nDetermining LW(\xce\xbb) by Upward Extrapolation\nTo determine LW(\xce\xbb), the measurement of upwelling radiance from a selected depth zi is propagated to the\nsurface as\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb ) = Lu ( zi , \xce\xbb ) e\n\n(\n\n)\n\nK L zij , \xce\xbb zi\n\n.\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe depth zi is selected according to the following hierarchical rules:\n1.\n\nIf the data from the top arm are valid, then that depth is selected.\n\n2.\n\nElse, the data from the middle arm, if valid, are selected.\n\n3.\n\nElse, the data sequence is rejected entirely.\n-\n\nWater-leaving radiance is calculated by propagating Lu(0 ,\xce\xbb) through the interface as\n1\xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x81\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb ) ,\n(2.11)\nn2\nwhere the upward transmittance through the interface, for nadir viewing radiance, is approximately constant, with\nvalue\n\nLW ( \xce\xbb ) =\n\n1\xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x81\n= 0.543 ,\n(2.12)\nn2\nbeing only weakly dependent on wavelength and insensitive to wind speed (Austin 1974; see also Vol. I, Chapter 2,\nand Vol. III, Chapters 2 and 4).\n\nNormalized Water-Leaving Radiance\nSince the water-leaving radiances are apparent optical properties and are dependent upon the effects of the\natmosphere, variations in solar zenith angle \xce\xb8o, and the earth-sun distance d, it is necessary to normalize the data to\nremove these effects for some applications.

Note that LWN ( \xce\xbb ) must be transformed to Lex ( \xce\xbb ) (Vol. III, Chapter\nWN\n4) prior to match-up comparisons between MOBY and satellite water-leaving radiances.\n\n23\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 2.15: Comparison of a normalized water-leaving radiance spectrum measured by MOBY with the\nspectral band response functions of the MODIS ocean channels. The MOBY radiances have not been\ncorrected for stray light, as is obvious from the large offset between the blue and red spectrographs at 630 nm.\n\n2.6 DATA ARCHIVAL AND RECORDKEEPING\nBand averaged water-leaving radiances for SeaWiFS and MODIS are transmitted to the SeaWiFS and\nSIMBIOS Project Offices, where they are archived in SeaBASS. These data are also transmitted to and archived by\nthe MODIS Team at the University of Miami. All data recorded by the MOBY system and on MOCE and other\ncruises are archived at MLML in Moss Landing, California and at NOAA NESDIS in Camp Springs, Maryland.\n\n2.7 FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nTemperature Characterizations\nAlthough the MOS CCDs are temperature-controlled, the temperatures of the optical components in the\nspectrographs, the electronics, the MOBY fiber optics, and other system components are subject to environmental\nconditions. These ancillary instrument temperatures are recorded and archived, but are not used in the present data\nprocessing algorithms. Because the ambient temperature and degree of thermal equilibrium depends on the\nmeasurement purpose (calibration vs. in-water radiometry) and type of deployment (MOBY vs. MOS), the\n\n24\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nradiometric responsivities of MOBY and MOS are being studied as a function of temperature. Various temperaturecontrolled baths are used, including one large enough for MOS.\nStray Light Characterizations\nThe MOBY Project includes a suite of instruments, requiring multiple field deployments to address the stray\nlight issues. Once the required data are in hand, the stray light algorithm for all of the required instruments will be\noptimized. This may require separate model parameters for each input collector on MOBY. Then, the MOCE and\nMOBY data sets will be reprocessed, leading to an improvement in the accuracy of the derived LWN(\xce\xbb)\xe2\x80\x99s that are\nused for vicarious calibration of MODIS, SeaWiFS, and other ocean color satellite sensors. It is anticipated that the\nuncertainty in the correction will be about 10 % of the effect, e.g. the uncertainty in the corrected values from stray\nlight would be 0.5 % for a 5 % correction.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe NIST efforts are supported by NOAA under contract NA00AANEG0072.

Traditional shipboard observations enable detailed regional studies,\nbut provide limited spatial and temporal coverage. Observations from instruments on moored and drifting buoys\nafford excellent temporal and vertical resolutions, but are limited to Eulerian and Lagrangian spatial contexts,\nrespectively. Ocean color satellites offer excellent spatial and daily-to-weekly coverage, but are limited to clear-sky\nconditions and cannot account for variations with depth in the water column. In recent years, it has become\nincreasingly clear that the combined data from moorings, drifters, ships and satellites provide a powerful tool for\nidentifying and describing oceanographic processes (Dickey, 1991, 2003). The purpose of this chapter is to provide\nprotocols describing methods for making and applying time-series measurements from moored and drifting buoys in\nthis context.\nThe deployment and operation of moored and drifting observation platforms has proven to be a successful and\nreliable means of acquiring oceanographic and meteorological data (Dickey 1991, 2003; Smith et al. 1991; Chavez\net al. 1997). Bio-optical, radiometric and physical time-series measurements, made at high temporal resolution\nthroughout periods of several months duration from moored platforms, provide data describing important episodic\nand periodic oceanographic processes that are difficult to observe using other methods. Moorings have formed the\nfoundation of several long term ocean monitoring projects, including the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere\n(TOGA) observing system (McPhaden et al. 1998), the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT; Karl and Lukas, 1996),\nand the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM; Dickey et al. 1998a, 2001) at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS;\nSiegel et al. 2001) site, as well as several ONR and NSF JGOFS funded process studies of one or more years\nduration, including Biowatt (Dickey et al. 1987), Marine Light in the Mixed Layer (Dickey et al. 1991),\nJGOFS/ONR Arabian Sea Experiment (Dickey et al., 1998b), JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Study (Foley et al., 1998),\nand the ONR Coastal Mixing and Optics Experiment (Dickey and Williams, 2001). Moored bio-optical arrays were\nused in the Antarctic Environment Southern Ocean Process Study as part of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study\n(JGOFS) to study mesoscale processes in the Antarctic Polar Front (Abbott et al., 2000). Instrumented drifting\nbuoys of many different types have also been used in a variety of field campaigns including the TOGA-TAO project\n(McPhaden et al., 1998), the IronEx cruises (Kudela and Chavez, 1996) and the World Ocean Circulation\n\n35\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nExperiment (WOCE; http://www.soc.soton.ac.uk/others/woceipo/index.html). Regional ocean observing systems,\nsuch as the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS; www.gomoos.org) are now in operation, or are\nbeing planned in the near future with the long-term goal of forming a network of integrated, sustained operational\nobserving systems for the U.S. coastal waters (see Ocean.US web site). Government agencies now recognize the\nimportance of moorings and drifters and plan to implement an integrated ocean observing system incorporating both\ntechnologies (www.ocean.us.net).\nMoorings carry significant payloads, allowing many many different variables to be measured from each\nplatform. As a result of the large number of instruments and the necessary hardware needed to support a mooring\n(float, line, glass balls, anchor, acoustic release, etc.), these platforms are relatively expensive to build, deploy,\noperate and maintain. Drifters, on the other hand, are usually smaller, carry fewer instruments, need much less\nhardware, and each copy is far less expensive than a typical moored array. In addition, since drifters are designed to\ntrack water masses they can quantify the time-dependent evolution of physical and bio-optical properties within\nparticular water mass features. However, large numbers of drifters are needed, and as they are generally not\nrecoverable, they must be considered expendable. Moored instruments, on the other hand, are recovered and reused.\nMoreover the methods of interpreting mooring data are much better developed. Nevertheless, equivalent ship-based\nobservations are even more expensive than mooring, or drifter, observations. A relatively large number of drifting\ndata buoys can be used to augment high-resolution time-series measured with moored arrays at a few fixed\nlocations, seeking an optimal balance between spatial and temporal coverage (Dickey, 2003).\n\nFig. 3.1: Time-horizontal space scale diagram illustrating several physical and biological processes in\novals. (after Dickey, 2003).\nBio-optical measurements from moored and drifter platforms\nThe deployment of radiometers, and other bio-optical sensors, on moorings and drifters facilitates bio-optical\nmeasurements that transcend the spatial and temporal boundaries of classical shipboard methods (e.g. shipboard\nradiometric profiles) to enhance our understanding of oceanographic processes, particularly biological-physical\ncoupling. Moored arrays observe bio-optical variables and ocean current velocities from an Eulerian perspective,\nyielding vector transport of bio-optical properties at a fixed point. It was recognized in the initial version of the\n\n36\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nOcean Optics Protocols (Mueller and Austin, 1992) that optical measurements from moorings would provide new\ninsight into optical, oceanographic and biophysical measurements in the field and be important platforms for the\nvalidation of SeaWiFS. In particular, optical moorings were recommended as important platforms for the collection\nof long-term, in situ data that could be used, together with satellite ocean color data, for:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRadiometric validation of SeaWiFS normalized water-leaving radiance. This concept has been\nimplemented in the Moored Optical Buoy observatory off Lanai, Hawaii (Vol. VI, Chapter 2), data from\nwhich have been used as the primary reference for vicarious calibration of SeaWIFS and other satellite\nocean color sensors (Gordon and Wang, 1994; Clark et al. 1997; McClain et al. 2000a, 200b).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDeveloping and validating algorithms for pigment biomass and phytoplankton primary productivity\n(Dickey et al. 1998a, 2001; Chavez et al. 1999).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProviding long-term, virtually continuous, time series of in situ observations characterizing biogeochemical\nprocesses in the upper ocean.\n\nChavez et al. (1999) and (Dickey et al. 1998a, 2001) expanded these ideas as they relate to combining satellite\nocean color time series data with measurements from moored and drifting buoys to obtain regional and global\ndescriptions of biological variability. These applications require the use of in situ radiometers, and other bio-optical\nsensors, for long periods of time to evaluate and correct for inherent satellite under-sampling and degradation of\nsatellite color sensors.\nMulti-year deployments of optical moorings and frequent drifter deployments are now realistic as a result of\nrecent technological advances such as in hardware, power sources, and anti-fouling devices (Dickey et al. 1998a,\n2001; Chavez et al. 1997, 2000; Manov et al. 2003). In order to assure that radiometric and bio-optical data acquired\nfrom various optical moorings meet uniform standards of quality and accuracy, clear and rigorous sampling and data\nprocessing methods must be used consistently throughout the community.\nThe purpose of this chapter is to describe protocols covering:\n1.\n\nStrategic principles for the location and deployment duration of moored instrument arrays, and for\nnumbers, locations and frequency of deploying instrumented drifting buoys, to augment satellite ocean\ncolor imagery and shipboard sampling (or vice versa) in studies of mesoscale and regional scale\noceanographic phenomena.\n\n2.\n\nState of the art design and fabrication of bio-optical moored and drifting data buoys\n\n3.\n\nMethods for maintaining and operating moored instrument arrays, including:\na.\nb.\n\n4.\n\nMooring deployment\nPeriodic maintenance during deployments and replacement of moorings and instruments.\n\nSystem operation methods, including:\na.\n\nInstrumentation\n\nb.\n\nBio-fouling avoidance and mitigation\n\nc.\n\nOn-board autonomous instrument operations, data acquisition, data storage, sampling schedules,\ntime base methods (e.g. GPS on on-board clock), and time synchronization of data records from\nmultiple instruments.\n\nd.\n\nOn-board data processing and near-real-time data communications\n\ne.\n\nPlatform geo-location, for tracking drifting buoys, and as a safety measure should a mooring come\nadrift.\n\n5.\n\nMethods of data processing, quality control and analysis.\n\n6.\n\nData archival and retrieval.\n\nThe chapter concludes with insights into future directions for the design and applications of moored and drifting\nbio-optical buoys, together with satellite ocean color imagery, in studies of oceanographic biogeochemical\nphenomena.\n\n37\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 3.2: Map of selected currently deployed mooring platform projects around the world. Other planned and\ncurrently running mooring projects (not shown) can be found in Send et al. (2001)\n\n3.2 BIO-OPTICAL MOORING NETWORKS AND DRIFTING BUOY\nEXPERIMENTS: STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES\nThe configuration of a mooring, or drifter, is dependent upon the objective and strategy of the respective\nprojects. Ideally, the combination of the two types of instrumented buoys, shipboard oceanographic surveys, and\nsatellite remote sensing measurements will result in a four-dimensional observation system that encompasses time\nand space scales, ranging from seconds to decades and meters to global proportions, respectively (e.g., Dickey,\n1991, 2003; Dickey et al., 2003). Careful planning is critical if the desired results, products and benefits are to be\nrealized. The configuration of an ocean observatory must consider the following factors:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nScientific Objectives: such as satellite sensor validation, studies of biogeochemical cycling and temporal\nvariability in bio-optical properties of the upper ocean, and biological responses to physical forcing.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpace Scales of Processes: water mass formation, transformation, or advection\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTime Scales of Processes: diurnal, seasonal, episodic, or decadal\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLocation: coastal, equatorial, or central gyre oceanographic regimes\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nArray Type: drifter, single instrumented mooring, or a geographic array of moorings.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCoordination with Other Sampling Methods: such as shipboard measurements and satellite remote sensing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegional Issues and Users Needs: Regional ocean observatories may not be strictly science driven.\nGoMOOS is an excellent example of an observatory maintained to serve the broader public good through\n\n38\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nan infrastructure that collects data pertinent to the public, academic, private, and governmental institutions.\nIn the design of future ocean observatories, therefore, a balance must be maintained between scientific\nobjectives and the information needs associated with coastal issues of operational importance to regional\ninstitutions, governments, and commercial enterprises.\nThe purpose and locations (illustrated in Figure 3.2) of some successful moored and drifting projects are\ndescribed below (organized by types of oceanographic regimes).\n\nFigure 3.3: (a) Conceptual drawing of the MOOS moorings that are currently deployed. Each mooring\nis fitted with an assortment of biogeochemical and optical instruments. (b) Conceptual drawing of the\nnew MOOS mooring platform by MBARI. Each buoy houses an assortment of bio-optical instruments\nin the tower, bridle, and along the harness cable to specific depths. Future moorings will also utilize a\ncustom built vertical profiler and provide AUV docking stations.\nCoastal and Continental Shelf Oceanographic Features and Processes\nMOOS: The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) has employed advanced mooring platforms\nin coastal waters for over a decade as part of an ongoing comprehensive Monterey Bay Ocean Observing System\n(MOOS; Figure 3.3). The main reasons for deploying moorings in coastal settings are to observe the time-series\nrelationship between physical and biological dynamics in upwelling settings, study harmful algal blooms, advance\nour understanding of the three dimensional carbon cycling process, determine the impact of iron limitation on\ncoastal primary productivity, and serve as a test and development site for new sensors and mooring technology.\nMOOS utilizes two moorings, located at 36.755\xc2\xb0N, 122.025\xc2\xb0W (M1) and 36.692\xc2\xb0N, 122.390\xc2\xb0W (M2), that work\ntogether as an array. The MOOS program also includes bi-monthly shipboard oceanographic surveys and routine\nmonitoring of the study region using remote sensing observations. Recently, MBARI has modified the MOOS\nmooring concept to include satellite based bi-directional communications, event detection and response, as well as\n\n39\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nintegration and operation with Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles AUV\xe2\x80\x99s and automated vertical profilers fitted with\noptical instruments.\nSince 1993, a series of research initiatives, including the US GLOBEC North East Pacific and Coastal\nAdvances in Shelf Transport programs, have supported the deployment of a series of subsurface moored\nradiometers and optical drifters off the Oregon Coast and Northen California (Abbott and Letelier, 1998). The\ndrifters deployed were WOCE Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) Lagrangian drifters, manufactured by METOCEAN\nData Systems Ltd. and Satlantic, Inc. These instruments measure the location, sea surface temperature, upwelling\nradiance at 7 wavebands in the visible (412, 443, 490, 510, 555, and 670 nm (20 nm bandpass); and 683 nm (10 nm\nbandpass)) and downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (20 nm bandpass). Measurements are made every 90 seconds,\naveraged over a one hour period, and transmitted to shore-based laboratories via ARGOS. The subsurface moored\nradiometers are deployed below the first optical depth, between 5 and 10 m depth, and measure downwelling\nirradiance at the same 7 visible wavebands used in the drifters. All these optical sensors are calibrated by Satlantic,\nInc., before deployment.\nAVPPO: The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has developed a profiling mooring for coastal waters, the\nAutonomous Vertically Profiling Plankton Observatory (AVPPO). The AVPPO consists of buoyant sampling\nvehicle and a trawl-resistant bottom-mounted enclosure, which holds a winch, the vehicle (when not sampling),\nbatteries, and controller. Three sampling systems are present on the vehicle: a video plankton recorder, a CTD with\naccessory sensors, and a suite of bio-optical sensors including Satlantic OCI-200 and OCR-200 spectral radiometers\nand a WetLabs ac-9 dual path absorption and attenuation meter. At preprogrammed times the vehicle is released,\nfloats to the surface, and is then winched back into the enclosure with power and data connection maintained\nthrough the winch cable. Communication to shore is possible through a bottom cable and nearby surface telemetry\nbuoy, equipped with a mobile modem, giving the capability for near-real time data transmission and interactive\nsampling control.\n\nFigure 3.4: Locations of the GoMOOS moorings in the Gulf of Maine. For exact locations see\nhttp://gyre.umeoce.maine.edu/GoMoos/gommrg.phtml.\nGoMOOS: The Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System was initiated in late 2000, with the first deployment of\nthe entire mooring array completed in July 2001. GoMOOS was initiated as an opterational observatory, serving as\na benchmark for other user-driven ocean observing systems. The primary obective of GoMOOS is to provide the\n\n40\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ninfrastructure for collecting sustained, long-term observations of the Gulf of Maine region. The backbone of the\nGoMOOS is the mooring program. Ten mooring are located throughout the Gulf of Maine (Fig. 3.4; see\nwww.gomoos.org for exact locations); one in the deep basin, 4 along the shelf waters, and 6 located in nearshore\nenvironments. The standard suite of measurements on each mooring includes metereologic and hydrologic\nconditions (Fig. AHB2). Four of the GoMOOS moorings also have instrumentation to measure the bio-optical\nconditions. The GoMOOS program also includes a series of CODAR stations to map the surface currents over the\nentire Gulf of Maine, circulation and wave modeling programs, as well as utilizing NASA and NOAA remote\nsensing time series (ocean color, sea surface temperature, winds).\nCMO and PRIMER: The interdisciplinary oceanographic programs known as Coastal Mixing and Optics\n(CMO), Shelfbreak PRIMER (not an acronym), and Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) PRIMER conducted a number\nof coordinated field experiments in the vicinity of the New England continental shelf over the period from\nSeptember 1995 to August 1997 (Dickey and Williams, 2001; see www.opl.ucsb.edu). CMO focused on physical,\nbio-optical, and sedimentary processes on the continental shelf, while the Shelfbreak PRIMER investigated physical\nprocesses over the shelf and slope and their influence on sound transmission onto the shelf. The experiment utilized\nseveral different observing platforms enabling measurements over space scales from centimeters in the vertical to\ntens of kilometers in the horizontal and time scales from minutes to the annual cycle. The results of the experiment\nhave led to improved understanding of inter-relationships and couplings among physical, bio-optical, sedimentary,\nand acoustical properties and processes. Two hurricanes passed near the study site enabling novel research\nconcerning the physical and bio-optical effects of intense atmospheric forcing. Internal solitary waves and their\nrelation to bio-optical events was another highlighted study area.\nHyCODE: The Hyperspectral Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (HyCODE) was an Office of Naval\nResearch (ONR) sponsored five-year interdisciplinary program (see www.opl.ucsb.edu). HyCODE field\nexperiments were located off the coast of New Jersey at the Long-term Ecological Observatory site in 15 m water\ndepth (LEO-15), on the west Florida Shelf as part of the ONR Ecology of Harmful Algal Blooms (EcoHAB)\nprogram, and in the Bahamas near Lee Stocking Island as part of the ONR Coastal Benthic Optical Processes\n(CoBOP) program. The main objective of the HyCODE program was to develop an understanding of the diverse\nprocesses that control inherent optical properties (IOP) and apparent optical properties (AOP) in the coastal ocean\nby use of hyperspectral imagery. Platforms included moorings, ships, gliders, AUVs, and aircraft, most of which\nwere equipped with hyperspectral instrumentation. Basic research was centered on the investigation of the impact of\nrelatively small-scale physical, biological, and chemical processes on near-surface spectral IOP and AOP. Some of\nthe processes under investigation for the HyCODE project include advection of optically important material,\nphytoplankton growth and loss, bubble injection, sediment resuspension, fronts, and internal waves. Applied\nresearch focuses on the development and validation of hyperspectral ocean color algorithms. Moorings were used to\nprovide high temporal resolution bio-optical (i.e. IOP and AOP) and physical data sets. These experiments were\ndesigned to sample the maximum possible number of matched in situ IOP and AOP observations for calibrating,\ngroundtruthing, and relating subsurface optical properties (algorithm development) to satellite data, and to develop,\ntest, and validate optical models and high-resolution interdisciplinary models of the coastal ocean.\nMEPS: The Marine Environmental Prediction System (MEPS) is a network of moored buoys in Lunenburg\nBay, Canada (see www.phys.ocean.dal.ca/programs/cmep/cmep.html). MEPS is part of the CMEP (Centre for\nMarine Environmental Prediction), a initiative led by Dalhousie University and funded through the Canadian\nFoundation for Innovation. MEPS consists of three heavily instrumented buoys, a real-time, high speed broadband\ncommunications network, and a modeling and analysis system for transforming sensor data into information that can\nbe visualized by a broad range of system users. The buoy network provides data from AOP, acoustic, physical and\nmeteorological sensors to monitor the biological variability and transport of sedimements within Lunenburg Bay.\nThe system is designed to provide both high temporal, spatial and vertical resolution of processes within Lunenburg\nBay. This combination of a wide range of sensors and flexible data acquisition system with a large power system\nand high bandwidth wireless telemetry make this system ideal for validating remote sensing data in the coastal zone.\nEquatorial Oceanographic and Air-Sea Interaction Processes\nTOGA TAO/TRITON: The Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) observing system consists of ~70\nmoored platforms along the equatorial Pacific to observe oscillations associated with the El Nino and Southern\nOscillation (ENSO). These ENSO specific moorings cover the entire equatorial Pacific from 95\xc2\xb0W across the date\nline to 165\xc2\xb0E, from 8\xc2\xb0N to 8\xc2\xb0S. Recently the project name was changed to the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/Triangle\n\n41\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nTrans-Ocean Buoy Network (TAO/TRITON) array to recognize the introduction of TRITON mooring array\n(http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/TRITON/) of buoys in the western Pacific by the Japan Marine Science and\nTechnology Center (JAMSTEC); these moorings replaced 12 ATLAS buoys along 137\xc2\xb0E, 147\xc2\xb0E, and 156\xc2\xb0E in\n1999.\nEqPac: The first moored bio-optical measurements in the equatorial Pacific (0o, 140o W) were conducted by the\nUCSB (formerly USC) during JGOFS in 1991-1993 (Foley et al., 1998). More recently, two selected ATLAS\nbuoys in the equatorial Pacific were modified by MBARI to accommodate robust instrument packages for openocean bio-optical and biogeochemical measurements as part of SIMBIOS ocean color validation (Figure 3.5). The\ndesigns of the two moorings, commonly referred to by MBARI as EP1 (0\xc2\xb0, 155\xc2\xb0W) and EP2 (2\xc2\xb0S, 170\xc2\xb0W), are\nTAO ATLAS buoys modified to host optical and chemical instruments with the objectives:\n1.\n\nTo obtain near real-time moored bio-optical measurements, including LWN, at two locations in the\nequatorial Pacific for calibration-validation of satellite ocean color sensors.\n\n2.\n\nTo obtain optical profiles at up to 30 stations per year in the equatorial Pacific, including derivation of LWN,\nfor calibration-validation of satellite ocean color sensors.\n\n3.\n\nTo use hyperspectral optical data from Monterey Bay and the equatorial Pacific, in conjunction with in situ\nbiogeochemical sampling and satellite data, to contribute to bio-optical algorithm development.\n\n4.\n\nTo determine the spatio-temporal variability in phytoplankton biomass, primary production, carbon dioxide\nand nutrient distributions, as a result of physical perturbations.\n\nFigure 3.5 Conceptual drawing of the modified ATLAS mooring platform located in\nthe equatorial Pacific (EP1: 0\xc2\xb0, 155\xc2\xb0W, EP2: 2\xc2\xb0S, 170\xc2\xb0W). Each optical mooring is\nequipped with radiance and irradiance sensors, and other equipments labeled above.\nPIRATA: The project PIRATA (Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic) maintains a string of\nmoorings in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean that is equivalent to the Pacific TAO array (Servain et al. 1998).\nPIRATA is a multinational pilot experiment in operational oceanography, with the participation of Brazil, France\nand the USA. The PIRATA network consists of 12 ATLAS moorings, extending along the equator and two\nmeridional lines. This geographic configuration is designed to monitor persistently strong wind forcing over the\n\n42\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nwestern Equatorial Atlantic basin, together with seasonal-to-interannual variability in SST in the central and eastern\nbasins. The meridional arrays cover the regions of high SST variability associated with the SST dipole mode. A set\nof spectroradiometers and fluorometers have been deployed at the Lambada mooring (8N, 38W) in the PIRATA\narray to add a biogeochemical component to the program and to study the effect of the Amazon River/North\nEquatorial Counter Current, tropical instability vortices, the effect of dust on phytoplankton productivity and carbon\ncycling in this region. This bio-optical mooring addresses the following three specific objectives:\n1.\n\nProvide high temporal resolution (6 times daily) in-situ spectroradiometric measurements to fill missing\nsatellite measurements due to dust, clouds, and gaps due to satellite orbit patterns, sun glint avoidance and\ntilt maneuvers.\n\n2.\n\nUse the in-situ measurements to evaluate atmospheric correction algorithms by comparing the in-situ and\nsatellite derived normalized water leaving radiance estimates.\n\n3.\n\nUse the combination of the chlorophyll concentrations derived from the in-situ spectroradiometric\nmeasurements and fluorometric measurements to study both temporally short events, such as tropical\ninstability waves and the effect of aeolian dust deposition on marine productivity (including the time lag\nbetween dust deposition and increased chlorophyll biomass), as well as long-term trends in primary\nproduction and biogeochemical cycles in this region.\n\nJGOFS EQPAC Drifter Studies: The first deployment of a drifting buoy with high precision optics (McLean\nand Lewis, 1991) was carried out in 1994, in association with the JGOFS Equatorial Pacific Process Study. The\ndrifters were air-launched from a NASA P-3 low altitude aircraft, which was carrying out remote sensing support of\nthe seagoing mission. The buoy was a modified Compact Meteorological and Oceanographic Drifter (CMOD)\nmanufactured by MetOcean Data Systems. A seven channel (450, 492, 532, 562, 656, 683, 700 nm) downlooking\nradiance sensor (Satlantic) was deployed on the buoy approximately 0.5 meters below the sea-surface and a single\nuplooking irradiance sensor (490 nm) was deployed on the extendable mast above the surface.\nRaw data was\ncommunicated via the ARGOS system. Radiances were propagated to and through the sea-surface using empirical\nalgorithms for spectral attenuation, and normalized by the spectral downwelling irradiance inferred from the\nmeasured value at 490 nm and a model for spectral sun and sky irradiance. Two buoys were successfully deployed\nduring this experiment and operated for several months. The resulting normalized water-leaving radiances were\nused to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. Based on these data, several novel syntheses resulted, ranging from a\nmeans to integrate shipboard estimates of primary production and grazing over the larger scale (Landry et al., 1997),\nand an improved understanding of the role of tropical instability waves in the production dynamics of this region\n(Foley et al., 1997). These first drifting buoys were the predecessors for subsequent optical deployments on several\nplatforms, notably the surface WOCE/OCM drifters used extensively by Oregon State University (Abbott and\nLetelier, 1998).\nOceanographic Processes in Oligotrophic Water Masses\nBATS/BTM: The Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM) was first deployed in 1994 and continues in operation today\n(Dickey et al., 1998b, 2001a). High frequency, long-term data measured by the BTM instruments are used for\nstudies and models of upper ocean biogeochemistry and physics, to develop and test new multi-disciplinary sensors\nand systems, and to provide validation data for satellite ocean color imagers including SeaWiFS. The\ncomplementary Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) was established in 1988 as part of the U.S. JGOFS\nprogram, to characterize, quantify, and understand processes in the Sargasso Sea that control ocean\nbiogeochemistry, especially carbon, on seasonal to decadal time scales. BATS ship sampling is done monthly and\nevery two weeks during the springtime. Ship-based bio-optical profiles (sampling in concert with BATS) and\nremotely-sensed ocean color data have been obtained at the BATS site (Fig. 3.2) since 1992 by the Bermuda BioOptics Program (BBOP; Siegel et al. 2001). BTM measurements were an important addition as processes with time\nscales of less than a few weeks (e.g., eddies, wind-events, and transient blooms) cannot be resolved with monthly or\nbi-weekly shipboard observations. The BTM program has tested and utilized a broad range of autonomous sampling\nsensors and systems. These include new measurements of pCO2, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, trace elements (e.g.,\niron and lead), several spectral inherent and apparent bio-optical properties, 14C for primary production, and currents\n(Dickey et al., 1998a, 2001). Several bio-optical systems designed to measure IOP and AOP have been tested using\nthe BTM (Figure 3.6). The bio-optical instuments (placed on the surface buoy and at 2 to 4 different depths) are\nused to determine relevant remote sensing parameters such as remote sensing reflectance (e.g., Dickey et al., 2001;\nZheng et al., 2002, 2003). The depths are optimally selected to enable extrapolation of subsurface radiance to the\n\n43\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nsurface. An advantage of mooring validation is the high number of match-up data for satellite calibrations (data are\ncollected regardless of cloud cover as well).\n\nFig. 3.6. Schematic illustration of the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), showing\nan example of the taut-wire mooring, surface buoy, and instrument locations.\nHOT: The Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program was initiated in 1988 in parallel with the BATS program\nprogram. The HOT measurements are conducted at the oligotrophic Station ALOHA (22o-45\'N, 158 o-00\'W) site\nnorth of Oahu. HOT\xe2\x80\x99s main objective is to obtain a long time-series of physical and biogeochemical observations in\nthe North Pacific subtropical gyre to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ndocument and understand seasonal and interannual variability of water masses, develop climatologies of\nphysical and chemical variables,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ndocument and understand seasonal and interannual variability in primary production, new production and\nparticle export from the surface ocean,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nquantify time-varying concentrations of carbon dioxide, and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nstudy the ecology of a subtropical gyre.\n\nHOT\xe2\x80\x99s core measurements were selected to provide a data set to improve existing C-N-P biogeochemical models.\nSelected data trends related to the intensification of N and P cycles, changes in microbial community structure and\nthe role of high frequency physical events have been documented. An interdisciplinary instrumented mooring was\ndeployed at the HOT site in 1996, and continued in operation until about 2000 (Letelier et al., 2000). The mooring\nexperiment, dubbed HALE ALOHA (Hawaii Air-sea Listening Experiment; Hale is also a Hawaiian word translated\n\xe2\x80\x9cat the house of\xe2\x80\x9d) initially included meteorological, physical, optical and chemical sensors. Additional instruments,\n\n44\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nincluding two water samplers designed for trace metal and nutrient analyses (Ed Boyle, MIT; Pers. Comm.), current\nmeters, conductivity-temperature (CT) sensors, and a cellular phone for daily data transmission and instrument\ninterrogation, were added during the HALE ALOHA-II experiment. Since that time, the mooring has been\nrecovered and redeployed a total of five more times, and the mooring instrument configuration has remained more,\nor less, the same. The data collected by this deep-sea mooring facility are critical to the detection and understanding\nof the mesoscale processes hypothesized to be the dominant causes of biogeochemical variability in this subtropical\ngyre habitat. The recently funded NOPP MOSEAN program (www.opl.ucsb.edu) will deploy a new HALE\nALOHA mooring, quite similar to the BTM, near the HOT site as well as a shallow water mooring in Santa Barbara\nChannel off California. Data collected by the deep-sea mooring are essential for detection and understanding of the\nmesoscale processes that contribute significantly to biogeochemical variability in this subtropical gyre habitat.\nThe Southern Ocean\nThe Antarctic Polar Front is a complex set of meandering jets, which appear to support enhanced primary\nproductivity. The U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) conducted a series of survey and process studies in\npart to study the processes regulating primary productivity in this high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) region.\nAbbott et al. (2001) deployed a set of surface velocity drifters, some of which were equipped with bio-optical\nsensors, to study the temporal and spatial scales of biological and physical processes in the Antarctic Polar Frontal\nZone (APFZ). There were two primary sets of deployments: November 1997 before the spring bloom and January\n1998 after the spring bloom. The November deployment revealed a strong spring bloom, although it decreased over\ntime, persisted at somewhat higher values throughout the drifter deployment than the bloom observed at a fixed\nmoored optical array. In late spring when incoming solar radiation began to increase, the vertical motions associated\nwith the meanders strongly affected the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass, primarily through their impact on\nlight availability. Weaker meandering was observed in the January deployment, and chlorophyll values remained\nrelatively constant. As the bloom began to decay, it appears that nutrient availability became more important in\nregulating phytoplankton photosynthesis. Some of the drifters in the November deployment were deployed in\ncoherent clusters, thus allowing us to calculate vertical velocities associated with the meanders. Estimates of\nfluorescence/chlorophyll suggest that areas of upwelling and downwelling alternately decrease and increase\nphotosynthetic stress, perhaps as a result of changes in the availability of iron or light during the formation of the\nbloom.\n\nFigure 3.7:\n\nA subsurface moored bio-optical instrument array\n\n45\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ndeployed during Southern Ocean JGOFS (Abbot et al. 2000).\nAs part of the Southern Ocean JGOFS program, 12 subsurface optical moorings were deployed in a grid\nformation to study the mesoscale variability around 60.5\xc2\xb0S, 170.0\xc2\xb0W, between October 1997 and March 1998. Each\nmooring was a bottom-tethered mooring extending from the sea floor to 50 m below the sea surface (Fig. 3.7).\nAttached to each of these moorings was an irradiance sensor head that measured downwelling irradiance at seven\nwavebands in the visible from a depth of 50 m (Abbott et al. 2000). In addition, an array of physical and optical\ndrifters was deployed within the Antarctic Polar Front zone to study the dynamics of the water masses meandering\nalong this front (Abbott et al. 2001). Previously, optical drifter deployments had been successful in sampling eddies\noff the Antarctic peninsula (Letelier et al. 1997).\nCalifornia Current System Drifter Studies\nAbbott and Letelier (1998) used data from bio-optical drifters deployed in the California Current. to estimate\nthe decorrelation time scales (a measure of persistence) for chlorophyll (as estimated from radiance ratios) and for\nsun-stimulated fluorescence/chlorophyll (as a proxy for photosynthetic rate). These scales were significantly\ndifferent in the nearshore zone (<200km from shore) while they were nearly identical in the offshore zone (>400km\nfrom shore. This implies that the ability to harvest light (as indicated by chlorophyll content) was not in balance\nwith the ability to use light (as indicated by fluorescence/chlorophyll) in the nearshore zone. The similarity of the\ndecorrelation time scales in the offshore zone suggest that the phytoplankton was more nearly in equilibrium.\nAbbott and Letelier (1998) also noted that physical time scales (as indicated by sea surface temperature) were nearly\nthe same as the biological time scales in the nearshore zone but were significantly longer in the offshore zone. The\nshort time scales (2 days) in the nearshore zone is consistent with variable upwelling and with previous observations\nof strong correlations between temperature and phytoplankton chlorophyll. In the offshore zone, physical processes\naffecting SST and chlorophyll are different, and there was little correlation between the two. Thus bio-optical\ndrifters can be used to study the relative roles of physical and physiological processes in governing the spatial\npatterns ofphytoplankton. Similar drifter deployments have been made as part of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics\n(GLOBEC) Northeast Pacific Program off the Oregon coast in 2000 and 2002.\n\n3.3 MOORING AND DRIFTER ARRAY CONFIGURATIONS\nOptical moorings designed for long-term deployments at open ocean sites must be capable of maintaining the\nintegrity of optical and other measurements while the instruments are unattended for prolonged periods of time.\nDetails of traditional mooring engineering concepts, theories and hardware configurations can be found in Berteaux\n(1991). Successful early examples of multiple-task optical moorings were the Multivariable Moored System\n(MVMS; Dickey et al. 1991, 1993) and the Bio-optical Moored System (BOMS; Smith et al. 1991). Optical drifters\ncan be designed for short or long term deployments, as recoverable, or disposable, in coordination with various\noceanographic sampling methods.\nMoored Surface Buoys\nMoored buoys generally have similar design configurations consisting of a tower, flotation buoy, bridle,\nmooring line, acoustic release, and anchor (Table 3.1). The TOGA array, for example, uses both the Profile\nTelemetry of Upper Ocean Currents design (PROTEUS; McPhaden et al., 1991) and the Autonomous Temperature\nLine Acquisition System (ATLAS) buoys designed by NOAA/PMEL (Milburn and McClain 1986). The PROTEUS\nand ATLAS frames are essentially similar in design (Figures 3.3 and 3.5). The ATLAS buoy employs a 2.3 m\ndiameter toroid, fabricated with fiberglass over a foam core, a simple aluminum tower (+4.9 m) and a stainless steel\nbridle capable of holding a stainless-steel instrument cage. Each mooring platform is equipped with a low-cost\nATLAS wind and thermistor chain array (Hayes et al. 1991). Two of the ATLAS buoys in the equatorial Pacific\n(M1 and M2, see above) were modified to host optical and chemical instruments. Currently deployed MOOS\nmoorings are also of a PROTEUS design, modified to accommodate an instrument controller, solar panels, an\nelevator assembly for mounting near-surface sensors, and instrument cages for additional sensors at 0, 10 and 20 m\ndepth. The elevators allow service of sensors, which are subject to substantial bio-fouling, at monthly intervals. The\n\n46\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nstainless steel cages at 10 and 20 m protect the instruments. The new MOOS moorings are welded from aluminum\nutilizing a Surlyn discus buoy.\n\n47\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nTable 3.1: Characteristics of moored bio-optical buoys, selected as examples from instrumented mooring networks covering the oceanographic regimes\nillustrated in Figure 3.1.\nPROJECT:\n\nMOOS\nM1 & M2\nMBARI\n\nTAO/TRITON\nEP1\nMBARI\n\nTAO/TRITON\nEP2\nMBARI\n\nPIRATA\nLambaba\nMultinational\n\nHOT: HALE\nALOHA\nUH\n\n36.76oN, 122.02oW\n36.69oN, 122.39oW\n2000 to\n~4000 m\nPROTEUS\n2.5\n5.5\nSemi-Slack\nReverse Catenary\nSolar Panels &\nBatteries\n1 Month\n\n0oN, 155oW\n\n2oS, 170oW\n\n8oN, 38oW\n\n22.75oN,158oW\n\n>2000\n\n>2000\n\nATLAS\n2.3\n4.9\nTaut Wire\n\nATLAS\n2.3\n4.9\nTaut Wire\n\nATLAS\n2.3\n4.9\nTaut Wire\n\nBattery Pack\n\nBattery Pack\n\nBattery Pack\n\n1 Year\n\n1 Year\n\n???\n\nOASIS\n(MBARI)\nYes\n\nOASIS &\nATLAS\nYes\n\nOASIS &\nATLAS\nYes\n\nSTORE-X\n\nRF and Satellite\nComms.\n\nARGOS\n\nMEPS\n\nBATS\nBTM\nUCSB\n\n4750\n\nDalhousie\nUniversity\nLunenburg\nBay, Canada\n20 m\n\nGuardian\n3\n~5?\nSemi-Taut\nWire\nSolar Panel &\nBatteries\n1 Month\n\nSurlyn discus\n1.2m\n4\nSemi-Taut Bimoor\nSolar Panels\n& Batteries\n6-12 months\n\nWHOI/UCSB\n3\n5\nSemi-Taut Wire\n\nDACNet\n\nYes\n\nMultiple\nData Loggers\nYes\n\nMultiple\nData Loggers\nYes\n\nARGOS\n\nARGOS\n\nNone\n\nHigh speed\nbroadband\nwireless\n\nGPS\nARGOS\nARGOS\nPLATFORM\nNAVIGATION\nFIGURE:\n3.3\n3.5\n3.5\n* Nominal operating service life between refurbishment/replacement visits.\n\nARGOS\n\nARGOS\n\nGPS\n\nInductive Link,\nAcoustic &\nARGOS\nTelemetry\nARGOS\n\n3.9 & 3.10\n\n3.6 &3.8\n\nINSTITUTION:\nLOCATION:\nDEPTH (m)\nBUOY TYPE:\nDiameter (m)\nHeight (m)\nMOORING\nTYPE:\nPOWER\nDEPLOYMENT\nDURATION*\nCONTROLLER/\nDATA-LOGGER\nON-BOARD\nDATA\nSTORAGE\nNEAR REALTIME\nTELECOMM\n\n48\n\nYes\n\n31.7oN,64.2oW\n4600\n\nBattery Pack\n6 Months\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nA newly designed buoy was developed jointly by UCSB and WHOI to accommodate a variety of\ninterdisciplinary sensors and systems (Figure 3.8). Some of the technical features of the new buoy include: reduced\nsize for safer ship operations, removable instrumentation well, upgraded tower, improved and removable bridal, and\noverall total weight reduction. The buoy is equipped for satellite data telemetry, using ARGOS at present, and an\nIridium system will be added in May 2003. The expected lifetime of the new buoy is about 10 years. The new buoy\nwas deployed at the BTM site in September 2002, and another of this design is currently under construction to\nreplace the present HALE-ALOHA (see above).\n\nFig. 3.8: Photograph of the newly designed and recently deployed interdisciplinary\nBTM surface buoy (www.opl.ucsb.edu).\nThe MEPS buoys are 1.2m Surlyn discus buoys. These house the DACNet computer system, wireless telemetry\nsystem, batteries and solar panels. The AOP sensors are deployed on a secondary surface-tracking package with a\n33cm float to minimize shading. This small float is suspended within a triangular guard frame 9m on a side. The\nAOP package consists of a hyperspectral Es, a hyperspectral Lu sensor (at 40cm), and a chain of four, four channel\nirradiance sensors placed at 2, 4, 8, and 12m below the small surface float. The system also includes two ADVs\n(acoustic doppler velocimeters) and an ADCP (acoustic doppler current profiler) on a bottom-mounted frame.\nPower and real-time telemetry are connected via special Kevlar electromechanical cables to the main discus buoy.\nTo avoid tangling of cables and the various packages, both the surface tracking AOPs and the main discus bouy are\nbi-moored to train wheels at the bottom. A schematic of the system configuration is shown in Figure 3.9. A photo\nof one of the buoy systems deployed is shown in Figure 3.10.\nAnother buoy package in common use is the HyperTSRB, a tethered buoy often deployed for vicarious\ncalibration of remote sensing platforms. This system was originally developed for the ONR CoBOP and HyCODE\nprograms to measure hyperspectral reflectance near the ocean surface. A typical configuration uses an in-air\nhyperspectral irradiance sensor to measure incident irradiance and a hyperspectral radiance sensor to measure\nupwelled radiance 50 cm below the surface. The buoy hull uses a 33 cm diameter flotation collar to keep the\nradiometers at the surface. Eight of these systems were used as calibration/validation references for the\nhyperspectral NRL PHILLS airborne imager during both HyCODE and CoBOP experiments. More recent\nconfigurations also utilize a multichannel chain of four irradiance radiometers below the surface (typically at 2, 4, 8\nand 16m) for computing the diffuse attenuation coefficient. This type of configuration is used as part of MEPS.\nOther autonomous coastal monitoring systems have used these sensors as well, using the STOR-X and a cellular\nphone for data telemetry.\n\n49\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 3.9: MEPS bi-moored system configuration showing the three main packages, the surface discus\nbuoy, the surface tracking hyperspectral TSRB and four channel K Chain, and the bottom mounted\nacoustics. This configuration minimizes the effects of platform shading from the main buoy, and\nallows subsurface radiometers to be placed close to the surface without interference. This provides\noptimal performance in turbid coastal waters.\n\nFigure 3.10: Photograph of one of the MEPS buoy systems in Lunenburg, Canada (a\nUNSECO World Heritage Site). This buoy is located in 20m of water near the harbour\nmouth. The main package containing batteries, solar panels, DACNet computer,\nmeteorological station and wireless telemetry system is on the right. The surface tracking\noptical package, located about 50m away from the main buoy is in the left foreground.\n\n50\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 3.11: Conceptual drawing of the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Color\xe2\x80\x9d GoMOOS moorings that have bio-optical\ninstrumentation for use in ocean color remote sensing validation/calibration. The right panel shows the\nabove water irradiance sensor mounted on the buoy, the ocean color bio-optical instrumentation package\nmounted at 3m, and the small optics package mounted on the mooring at 18 m (from top to bottom).\nBuoys are usually moored using either a taut, or slack, wire design, although the recent introduction of wires\nwith more spring offers advantages of both designs. Wire types include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTaut-Wire Surface Moorings: For the ATLAS systems used in the TAO, TRITON and PIRATA mooring\nnetworks, the upper 500 m of the mooring utilizes a jacketed 1.27 cm non-rotating (nilspin). This segment\nis followed by an eight-strand plaited nylon line (1.9 cm) extending to just above the ocean bottom, where\nan acoustic release couples it to a ~2000 kg railroad wheel anchor. Taut-line moorings, with a nominal\nscope of 0.985 (ratio of mooring line length to water depth) are used in water depths greater than 1800 m to\nensure that the upper section of the mooring is nearly vertical. More detailed information on the ATLAS\ntaut-wire mooring design is available on-line at (http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSlack-Wire Moorings: The TAO slack-line moorings have a scope of 1.35, due to either shallow\nbathymetry, or severe current regimes. GoMOOS moorings are slack-wire moorings, with a scope of ~\n1.32, using 80 m of wire and 100 m of chain, anchored by 3 railroad wheels (Fig. 3.11). In these cases, the\nupper portion of the mooring is kept close to vertical (but less so than with taut-line moorings) by using a\nreverse catenary design. The reverse catenary design allows the capabilities of being stretched under\ntension while utilizing traditional catenary concepts through a semi-slack method. Although taut-line\nmoorings maintain subsurface sensor locations at or near desired depths, surface instruments may be\nsubjected to stronger forces from waves and currents. The slack-line moorings provide greater flexibility in\nthe upper water column, which may help reduce these forces.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSemi-slack/taut Wire Mooring: MOOS moorings are on \xe2\x80\x98semi-slack\xe2\x80\x99 S shaped tethers with a 1.20% scope.\nThe BTM and HALE ALOHA 3 m diameter buoy platforms have been previously configured as semi-slack\nmoorings. However, the new configurartions will be an inverse catenary design to reduce stress on all\nmooring components..\n\nSubsurface Moorings\nSubsurface moorings tested off Hawaii and used in the Southern Ocean during JGOFS (Fig. 3.7) are designed to\nminimize the vertical motion of radiometers derived from wave action and to remove the shading effect of a surface\nbuoy and wiring. The mooring hardware includes two glass spheres and one large steel sphere. The 17" glass sphere\nbeneath the sensor head was used to limit the range of tilt of the sensors. Note, however, that the mooring design\nallows vertical and horizontal movement of the sensors with variations in currents.\nProfiling Moorings\nProfiling optical moorings generally consist of a buoyant instrumented vehicle and a bottom-mounted enclosure\nhousing a winch, controller and batteries if used autonomously. Profiles are achieved by paying out a tether which\ncan also allow communications between the controller and instruments on the vehicle. Communications with a\nshore-based server, for example with a cell phone modem, allows data transmission and periodic updating of\nmission parameters such as profiling frequencies and minimum profile depth. Surface detachment of the profiling\nvehicle from the tether can facilitate instrument maintenance without recovery of the whole system.\nDrifting Buoy Configurations\nDrifting buoys have been deployed with AOP sensors in various configurations, most notably the ship-launched\nor air-launched CMOD type (McLean and Lewis, 1991), and the more common WOCE/OCM type, both\nmanufactured by MetOcean Data Systems Limited. Both systems have surface tracking in-water multichannel\nradiance radiometers, and a single channel above water irradiance sensor (490 nm) and telemeter data back to the\nuser via the ARGOS system. Due to bandwidth restrictions, the systems report an hourly average of radiometric\nmeasurements sampled every 90 seconds. Typically (latitude dependent) 12 data collections are reported to the user\nper day.\n\n51\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nThe CMOD type utilized a gas cartridge inflatable float around an 11cm diameter hull containing batteries,\ncomputer system and an ARGOS transmitter. At the base of the hull a seven channel radiance sensor (OCR-100)\nprovided a nadir view of the light field at a depth of 50cm. At the top of the ARGOS antenna mast, a single channel\n(490 nm) irradiance sensor provided a reference for ambient solar radiation. A conical cloth drogue and base weight\nprovided platform stability.\nThe WOCE type drifter uses a standard 35cm fiberglass hull with batteries, computer and ARGOS transmitter\n(Fig. 3.12). In the WOCE type buoys, a 1m diameter holey sock drogue located about 10m below the buoy is used\nto significantly improve water current tracking capabilities. A seven channel radiance sensor (OCR-100) is placed\non the bottom of the hull, offset and angled ten degrees off nadir to avoid interference from the drogue. A single\nchannel (490 nm) irradiance sensor is located on top of the hull. Since the irradiance sensor is very close to the\nwater surface, it may become submerged, thus a submergence sensor is used to avoid collecting surface irradiance\nwhen the sensor is below the surface. In experiments off the Oregon Coast, the typical lifetime for these drifters was\n3 - 7 months, although some failed immediately upon, or shortly after, deployment, and one lasted for 10 months.\nDuring the Southern Ocean Iron Enrichment Experiment (SOFeX) in 2002, several WOCE drifters were deployed\nby OSU, in coordination with deployments of a more heavily instrumented recoverable drifter by MBARI (Fig. 3.12\nand Table 3.2).\n\nFig. 3.12: Configurations of drifters that were used during SOFeX 2002. The panel on the left\nschematically shows the configuration of the \xe2\x80\x9cshort term\xe2\x80\x9d MBARI drifter, while the panel on the right\nshows the configuration of the \xe2\x80\x9cone-use\xe2\x80\x9d OSU/WOCE drifter.\n\n3.4 MEASUREMENT METHODS AND INSTRUMENTATION\n\n52\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nMany of the variables described as required and highly desired in Volume I, Chapter 3 (Table 3.1) can be\nmeasured using arrays of instruments mounted on buoys3, either moored or free-drifting. The protocols covering\ninstrument performance characteristics, and related characterization and calibration methods, for radiometers\n(Volume II, Chapters 2 and 3), IOP instruments (Volume IV, Chapters 2, 3 and 5), in situ chlorophyll a fluorometers\n(Volume V, Chapter 3), and instruments for ancillary measurements such as Conductivity-Temperature-Depth\n(CTD), wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure (Volume II, Chapter 1) are fully applicable to the use of\nsuch instruments on buoys. These topics will not be repeated here. On the other hand, while methods for making\nthese measurements from buoys have much in common with the corresponding shipboard measurement methods for\nradiometry (Volume III, Chapter 2), IOP (Volume IV), and ancillary measurements (Volume I, Chapter 4), the\nprotocols for measurement methods on buoys must take account of special factors:\n1.\n\nAll measurements must take place autonomously, without real-time hands-on operator intervention.\n\n2.\n\nAutomated measurements must be reduced to digital (or less-often analog) form, and either transmitted via\na telecommunications link to a base laboratory, and/or stored on board for retrieval when the buoy is visited\nfor maintenance, or recovery, at time intervals typically ranging from weeks to months. Especially in the\ncase of free-drifting buoys, which are often treated as expendable and are not routinely recovered, the data\nmust be retrieved over typically low-bandwidth telecommunications links (such as ARGOS); therefore,\ndata retrieved in this way must usually be processed on-board and only limited data, e.g. temporal averages\nand standard deviations, are transmitted.\n\n3.\n\nAlthough special buoy designs permit continuous profile measurements of some variables over depth in the\nwater column, more typical buoy configurations are instrumented to make time series measurements only at\nthe surface and a few discrete depths.\nTable 3.2 Characteristics of drifting bio-optical buoys, selected as examples from the\nexperimental projects discussed in the text.\nPROJECT:\nINSTITUTION:\n\nSOFeX\nMBARI\n\nLOCATION:\n\nSouthern\nOcean\n>2000\nToroid Float &\nPayload \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x9d\n1\n1\nHoley Sock\n\nDEPTH (m)\nBUOY TYPE:\nDiameter (m)\nHeight (m)*\nDROGUE:\nPOWER\nDEPLOYMENT\nDURATION***\nCONTROLLER/\nDATA-LOGGER\nON-BOARD\nDATA\nSTORAGE\nTELECOMM\nPLATFORM\n\nBatteries\n2 Weeks\n(recovered)\nOASIS\n(MBARI)\nYes\n\nJGOFS EQPAC\nDalhousie\nUniversity\nEquatorial Pacific\n>2000\nCMOD (A size\nsonobuoy)\n.33\n.6\ncloth cone and base\nweight\nBatteries\n3-6\nMonths(expendable)\nMetOcean\n\nSOFeX\nOSU\nSouthern\nOcean\n>2000\nWOCE\n(sphere)\n0.35\n< 0.3\nWOCE type**\nBatteries\n6 Months\n(expendable)\n???\n\nNo\nARGOS\nARGOS\n\nRF Packet Radio\nGPS\n\n3\n\nNo\nARGOS\nGPS & ARGOS?\n\nAn instrumented buoy that is tethered to a ship, tower, or shore facility, and is actively attended by an operator\nduring use, is simply a particular instrument deployment mechanism used in shipboard (or equivalent platform)\nmeasurements. The protocols for this type of buoy and instrument configuration are those applicable to any other\nshipboard measurement method, and they do not fall within the context of this chapter.\n53\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nNAVIGATION\nFIGURE:\n3.12\n3.12\n3.7B\n* Above waterline.\n** A 12 m long fabric tube, 40 cm in diameter, suspended below a subsurface float at\n\xe2\x80\x933 m, which was in turn connected to the surface float using an elastic tether to\nisolate the drogue from surface wave motion.\n*** Nominal operating service life between refurbishment/replacement visits.\n4.\n\nRadiometric field measurement methods designed to minimize platform shading and reflection artifacts are\nneeded for autonomous measurements on buoys. The more successful methods used for shading avoidance\nin operator attended measurements from ships, i.e. free-fall profiling (Volume III, Chapter 2), are not\nreadily applied to radiometric measurements on moorings and drifters. The unusual MOBY platform\n(Volume VI, Chapter 2) is an example of a buoy and instrument configuration designed specifically to\naddress this problem, but it would be neither affordable, nor practical, to replicate such a configuration in\nthe vast majority of projects where bio-optical buoys are appropriately deployed (Section 3.2 above).\n\n5.\n\nUnattended instruments on buoys are either immersed in water, or exposed to the atmosphere, continuously\nfor periods of weeks to months without opportunity to clean optical windows, or other exposed sensor\nsurfaces. In this situation, the performance of buoy instrumentation is subject to progressive degradation\ndue to marine organism growth on sensors in water (biofouling), or salt, dust and/or bird dung deposition in\nair.\n\nThe remainder of this section describes methods for acquiring reliable measurements under the constraining\nconditions described above (see also the related methods in Vol. VI, Chapter 2, as applied to the more specialized\nMOBY observatory). The discussion emphasizes the mounting and integration of radiometric, optical, fluorescence,\nmeteorological, CTD, and other sensors under the control of an on-board microcomputer, pre-processing and storage\nof the data measured by those sensors, and near-real-time transmission of selected data values to ships, or\nlaboratories ashore.\nEssential characteristics of instrument arrays are summarized in Tables 3.3 and 3.4,\nrespectively, for moored and drifting buoy examples. Specific commercial4 and custom instruments listed by model,\nor name, in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 are briefly described below.\nInstrument Control and Data Acquisition\nA critical aspect of any mooring or drifter platform is its instrument controller and its ability to perform in harsh\nenvironments. The system controller must be configured to communicate with instruments, operate\nelectromechanical devices (e.g. shutter mechanisms), store measured data and metadata (e.g. GPS time, latitude and\nlongitude), preprocess measurements and transmit the resulting parameters to a ship or laboratory. Generically, a\nsystem controller consists of a microcomputer interfaced to an array of instruments, the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s power source\n(batteries and/or solar cells), and sometimes a telecommunications link. Many of the instruments used on buoys\nhave some sort of internal microcomputer, operate semi-autonomously to acquire data scans, store the data\ninternally, perhaps average scans over a specified time interval, and transmit digital data to the controller; the\ninstrument controller interfaces to these digital-format instruments using either multiple single channel interfaces\n(e.g. serial RS232), or a network protocol interface (e.g. serial RS485 or parallel IEEE-488). Other instruments may\nproduce an analog output, in which event the controller\xe2\x80\x99s microcomputer must also be interfaced to one or more\nanalog-to-digital (A-to-D) converters; for most such applications, it is necessary to calibrate the A-to-D converter by\nrecording it\xe2\x80\x99s digital responses to known voltage inputs. In other controller-instrument configurations, analog\ndevices may be connected to A-to-D ports of a digital instrument, e.g. a CTD, and communicated to the controller as\npart of its data frame.\nRecent development of smaller Ethernet devices has allowed the creation of Local Area Network on moorings,\nwhich can provide easy communications between both individual system controllers and serial output from\ninstruments. For example a controller may be physically separated from instruments connected to an Ethernet RS4\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this document to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n54\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n232 hub. In another variant developed by UCSB for the BTM, self-contained, battery operated data acquisition\nsystems at three depths combine acoustic telemetry with ARGOS satellite data telemetry for near real-time data\ntransmission.\nThe systems used on the GoMOOS bio-optical moorings are a blend of the examples described above. Each\nGoMOOS mooring is controlled by a Campbell Scientific CR10X control system. The Campbell system controls\nthe power and sampling for all of the metereological sensors, the current (Aanderra and RDI ADCP) and\nhydrographic (SeaBird SBE37 and SBE16 temperature and conductivity) sensors, as well as the wave sensor. The\nCampbell system also controls the mooring to shore transmissions of the data, which are mainly done using hourly\ncellular phone communications. Most moorings also utilize GOES transmissions as a backup method to transmit\ndata to shore in case of cellular phone problems. Because of limitations of the Campbell data logger in terms of\nstorage space and data resolution, it was necessary to utilize a separate data logger to collect, store and pre-process\nthe bio-optical data. The data logger was developed with WETLabs for implementation on the GoMOOS moorings.\nThe data logger has a microprocessor and firmware to control the power and sampling to 4 externally connected\nsensors. The data logger has 4 serial (RS232) input ports, one RS232 output port and a power port that can be\nconnected to a battery power supply. The GoMOOS implementation of the data logger firmware controls the\nsampling period and power to each of the 4 serial input ports. The GoMOOS optics data logger can either be set up\nto run in autonomous mode, or can be controlled externally via RS232 communications. The optics data logger\nrecords all of the raw data onto an on board flash disk for later retrieval and processing. The data logger is\nprogrammed to average each of the input data streams from each instrument, and outputs the averages and\ndiagnostics to the output RS232 serial port.\nTable 3.3 (Part 1 of 2): Radiometric, bio-optical and ancillary measurements and instruments on selected moored biooptical buoys; see Table 3.1 and Figures 3.1 and 3.2 for information on the location, buoy type and mooring configuration\nof each.\nMoored Buoy Array:\n\nVariable\nEs(\xce\xbb)\n\nEd(z, \xce\xbb)\n\nLu(z, \xce\xbb)\n\nEu(z, \xce\xbb)\nChl a\nFluorescence\nbb(z,\xce\xbb)\nc(z,\xce\xbb)\n\nSensor\nPRR-620\nHR3\nMiniSpec-I\nOCR504 ICSA\nPRR-600\nHR3\nOCI100\nOCI200\nOCR504 ICSW\nPRR-600\nHR3\nOCR100\nOCR200\nMiniSpec-R\nOCR507 R10W\nPRR-600\nHR3\nWETStar\nDFLS\nHS2\nHS-2, 4 or 6\nVSF\nac9\n\nMOOS\n\nTAO\n(EP1 &\nEP2)\n\nz (m)\n~ +4\n~ +4\n\nz (m)\n+3\n+2.8\n\nPIRATA\n(Lambaba)\nz (m)\n\nz (m)\n+3\n\n+0.5\n-10, -20\n-10, -20\n\n-20\n-10\n\n-10, -20\n-10, -20\n-1.5\n\n-20\n-10\n-1.5\n\n-2,-4,-8,-12\n2\n-3.6, -9.6\n-0.5\n-10, -20\n-10, -20\n-1.5\n\n-20\n-10\n-1.5\n\n-1.5\n-1.5\n\n-1.5\n-1.5\n\n-1.5\n\n---\n\n55\n\n-9, 40\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nWater\nTemp.

The system operates a preprogrammed user schedule, switches sensor\npower, acquires data from the various sensors, and stores the time tagged data onto a solid-state flash disk. The\nsystem can also be programmed to process and transmit data on ARGOS (as in PIRATA), cellular phone systems\nand broadband telemetry systems such as Freewave.\nThe data acquisition system used on MEPS is DACNet, which is a complete mooring management system\ncapable of multinode operation. DACNet typically consists of three main components, a PC104 computer system\non each buoy node, a wireless telemetry system, and a shore based central server. The MEPS configuration of\nDACNet has three buoy nodes located within 6km of a shore station. Each buoy node has 12 high-speed (up to\n115kbps) serial (RS-232) inputs, some of which were connected to serial instrument networks. In the initial\ndeployment MEPS had 18 individual sensors connected to each node collecting approximately 3MB of data in 20\nminutes of data collection each hour. This data was stored on a 1GB microdrive in each buoy and transmitted via a\nwireless telemetry system at up to 11Mbps back to the central server. Each buoy has four 85W solar panels\ncharging a 250Ah battery pack which is sufficient to serve a peak load of 40W for 20 minutes each hour, 24 hours a\nday. Guest ports on each buoy allow for the easy addition of new sensors and the ability to allow visiting scientists\nto connect sensors into the system, while device drivers are remotely loaded via the central server over the internet.\nUser access to the system for configuation control and maintanence is via web browser using secure HTTP. Data\n\n57\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\naccess is via FTP and SMTP interfaces. Data is provided in raw native format with time tags appended to each\nframe for later data processing by CMEP. The system has the capability to allow direct user connection to any\nsensor on the platform over the internet, via using TCP/IP facility within DACNet, which is useful for remote sensor\nconfiguration, sensor testing, and special measurement sequences.\nDACNet will also be used in the MERIS cal/val buoy, BOUSSOLE, to be deployed at the DYFAMED site the\nLigurian Sea. This system is operated by CNRS/INSU in Villefranche Sur Mer, France. On the BOUSSOLE buoy,\ndata is stored on disk and downloaded via high-speed wireless telemetry during periodic cruises to the area. System\nparameters and a limited amount of processed AOP data are sent back to CNRS via an ARGOS transmitter\nRadiometric Measurement Methods\nAbove-water incident spectral irradiance Es ( \xce\xbb ) , and in-water downwelling and upwelling spectral irradiance\nEd ( z , \xce\xbb ) and Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) , and upwelling spectral radiance Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) , are often measured using arrays of\n\nradiometers mounted on moored or drifting buoys. The notation here follows the definitions of Volume I, Chapter\n2, where z is depth in m, \xce\xbb is wavelength in nm, and ( \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) are the nadir and azimuth angles of the in-water\ndirectional radiance measurement. The directional nature of the in-water radiance field becomes critical when\nmeasured Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) field data are used to determine normalized water-leaving radiance LWN ( \xce\xbb ) and exact\nnormalized water-leaving radiance Lex ( \xce\xbb ) (Section 3.6 below and Volume III, Chapter 4).\nWN\nRadiometric measurements are typically acquired for relatively brief sampling periods at preprogrammed\nintervals during each day. The number and duration of radiometric measurement samples scheduled in a buoys\ninstrument controller program is based on factors including diurnal variability in incident radiation, productivity and\nother light-sensitive biological processes, scheduled ocean color satellite overpasses, and the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s electrical power\nmanagement plan for the particular deployment. Examples of radiometric sampling schedules for particular buoy\nexperiments are described below in Section 3.5, in addition to the following general guidelines:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn a single radiometric measurement sequence, measurements should be recorded for 10 to 15 minutes to\nallow averaging over variations in incident irradiance (due to clouds) and in-water radiometric variations\nresulting from surface waves.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn addition to daylight measurement sequences, it is recommended to acquire a dark measurement sequence\nnear local midnight.\n\nIn most of the instrument configurations listed as examples in Tables 3.3 and 3.4, radiometric collectors (either\nindividual radiometers, or collector optics connected via a fiber-optic lead to a remotely located radiometer) are\nmounted at one or more fixed depths in the water column. The Es ( \xce\xbb ) sensor is typically mounted on the buoy\nsuperstructure, while Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) and Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) sensors are typically mounted on the mooring cable at one or more\ndepths, and are often combined with a nadir-viewing Lu ( z , \xce\xbb ) sensor at each depth.\nThe depths at which radiometers are mounted in a fixed array depend on the particular buoy and the diffuse\nattenuation coefficient typical of the water masses the buoy is expected to observe. For many small drifting buoys,\ninstruments are mounted directly on the buoy to measure only Es ( \xce\xbb ) and Lu ( z , \xce\xbb ) , with the hull mounted radiance\nsensor at a depth z \xe2\x89\x85 1 m . When additional wire-mounted radiometers are included in the array, they should be\ndeployed at depths spaced to approximately determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient\nK ( \xce\xbb ref\n\n\xe2\x88\xab\n)=\n\nz90\n\n0\xe2\x88\x92\n\nK d ( z , \xce\xbb ref ) dz\nz90\n\naveraged over the first attenuation length z90 for a selected reference wavelength \xce\xbbref.\n\nWhen \xce\xbb ref = 490 nm , K(\xce\xbbref) is the diffuse attenuation coefficient determined from satellite ocean color data\n(Austin and Petzold 1981), and z90 = K ( 490 )\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nm is the depth from which 90% of the radiance contributing to\n\nLWN ( 490 ) originates by backscattering. Note that z90 is a function of wavelength, and that 490 nm is often used as a\n\nreference wavelength because it is the wavelength of maximum transparency in oligotrophic and mesotrophic water\n\n58\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nmasses. The median K med ( 490 ) and maximum K max ( 490 ) expected to be sampled during a particular buoy\ndeployment can be estimated from satellite ocean color images, combined with radiometric profiles from previous\nresearch cruises and optical buoy deployments in that water mass regime. Given that information, a reasonable\nguideline for K med ( 490 ) \xe2\x89\xa4 0.1 m -1 situations would be to place a single wire-mounted set of Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) and Lu ( z , \xce\xbb )\n\xef\xa3\xae K ( 490 ) + K max ( 490 ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xcb\x86\nat a depth midway between the minimum and median values of z90, i.e. at z90 = \xef\xa3\xaf med\n\xef\xa3\xba\n2\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xcb\x86\nz90\nif available, a second such radiometer package could be mounted at\nm.\n2\n\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\nm , and\n\nThe approach used on the GoMOOS moorings, for example, is to place the Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) sensors at the surface and\nat the yearly averaged 90% light level depth (for the 490 nm wavelength), typically 3 m and 18 m for the nearshore\ncoastal moorings, and 5 m and 30 m for the more oligotrophic, deep basin moorings. The GoMOOS moored arrays\nhave only have one Lu ( z , \xce\xbb ) sensor placed at 3m, a depth as near as to the surface as the mooring configuration will\nallow, and to minimize the effects of shadowing.\nPlatform shading effects on wire-mounted Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) and Eu ( z , \xce\xbb ) spectral irradiance sensors are similar to the\nship shadow effects discussed in Volume III, Chapter 2 (Section 2.2), but are considerably reduced by the much\nsmaller size of a buoy, compared to a ship.\nUpwelling radiance sensors may be mounted either on the underside of a buoy hull, to measure Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) at\na depth z \xe2\x89\x85 1 m , and/or on a mooring cable at fixed depths (often paired with a downwelling irradiance sensor) to\nmeasure Lu ( z , \xce\xbb ) in a nadir-viewing geometry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlatform shading effects for wire-mounted radiance sensors are directly analogous to ship shadow (and\nreflection) effects, again mitigated by the relatively small size of a buoy Volume III, Chapter 2 (Section\n2.2). For the larger buoys ( r \xe2\x89\xa5 0.5 m ) , at least, the uncertainties associated with platform shading for a\nwire-mounted measurement configuration are better understood, and more widely accepted within the\nocean color community, than are those associated with hull-mounted configurations.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor a hull-mounted radiance sensor, the shadows and reflections due to a buoy hull are more directly\nanalogous to the instrument self-shading case for a sensor radius equal to half the buoy hull diameter.\nWhen a nadir-viewing radiometer is mounted in the center of a buoy hull, the instrument self-shading\ncorrection protocol (Volume III, Chapter 2. Section 2.4) based on Gordon and Ding (1992) is directly\napplicable. The correction will be large in even clear, Case I water masses, however, and shading will\nsignificantly increase the uncertainty of water-leaving radiances derived from such measurements. In an\nattempt to reduce shading, some investigators have mounted radiance sensors near the edge of the buoy\nhull, and in some cases have pointed the radiometer radially away from the buoy center at a nadir angle\n\xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2 > 0 . In either of these cases, a modified self-shading correction algorithm must be devised, and\nvalidated to correct for platform shading and to determine the uncertainty of the resulting water-leaving\nradiance.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor profiling moorings, shading of downwelling radiometers is often not an issue. This may not the case\nfor upwelling sensors where engineering considerations may dictate a profiling package having a fairly\nlarge diameter.\n\nPerhaps the most significant factor distinguishing subsurface radiometric measurements using buoy arrays from\nsimilar shipboard measurements is biofouling due to growth of marine organism on optical collectors and windows\nduring prolonged, unattended deployments.\nHistorically, anti-fouling chemical compounds were applied to optical surfaces in an attempt to prevent\nmicrobial growth and settlement of larvae of sessile invertebrates. The results of this chemical approach were\ntypically unsatisfactory. In some recorded cases, biofouling was actually enhanced when chemical anti-fouling\ncompounds provided a rougher surface for organism attachments (McLean et al. 1997). In general, the toxicity and\nlimited retention time of antifouling compounds was proved to be undesirable.\n\n59\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nA copper shutter mechanism was developed to protect optical sensors from exposure except intermittently,\nwhen the shutter is opened to expose the windows/collectors for brief periods while measurements are made\n(Chavez et al., 2000; Manov et al., 2003). The buoy\xe2\x80\x99s instrument controller, as part of the programmed\nmeasurement schedule, activates the shutter mechanism. In the TOGA/TRITON, MOOS, and some other examples\ndescribed in Tables 3.3 and 3.4, such a copper shutter device is used to protect the subsurface radiometers from\nfouling. UCSB OPL and WETLabs, Inc. have designed non-contact servo controlled copper-shuttered devices for\nradiometers and other bio-optical sensors (Manov et al., 2003). This new battery-powered shuttered system uses a\ncommercial high torque servo with dual ball bearings and metal gears (Figure 3.13). A copper plate is attached to\nthe servo arm through a waterproof dynamic o-ring seal. The copper shutter is kept closed over the sensor\xe2\x80\x99s optical\nelements until a measurement is required. Several minutes of data are collected, and then the copper plate is swung\nback over the sensor to keep the optical elements protected from biofouling between measurement intervals. The\nOPL/WETLabs, Inc. battery-operated shutter system is self-contained and flexible, and is designed to be easily\ninterfaced and integrated into a complete data logging system.\n\nFig. 3.13. Examples of optical instruments equipped with copper shutter mechanisms to\nprotect the optical windows from bio-fouling. A new instrument is shown in the upper panels\nwith its shutter closed (left) and open (right). The lower panel shows biofouling organisms\ncovering a different instrument, except for its copper shutter, upon recovery from a moored\ndeployment.\nThe radiometric windows/collectors on MOBY, although continuously exposed to the water, are surrounded by\na copper bezel. The optical surfaces are cleaned monthly by divers, who also document the in-water radiometric\nresponsivities of the system using a portable, underwater lamp source (Vol. VI, Chapter 2).\nProfiling moorings can allow cleaning of radiometers by deploying the profiler to the surface where the\nwindows/collectors can be cleaned in-water. Ship-board and shore-based maintenance may also be possible if the\nprofiling vehicle can be detached from the tether.\n\n60\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nRadiometers\nThe buoy instrumentation arrays listed as examples in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 incorporate a variety of commercially\navailable radiometers, listed by the manufacturers model nomenclature. The wavelength characteristics of these\nsensors comply with those specified in Volume II, Chapter 2 (Table 2.1), and all comply with the other performance\ncharacteristics specified Volume II, Chapter 2. Several of the irradiance sensors may be configured to measure\nirradiance either in air, i.e. Es(\xce\xbb), or in water, i.e. Ed(z, \xce\xbb) or Eu(z, \xce\xbb). The reader is referred to Vol. II, Chapter 3,\nSects. 3.5 and 3.7 for more information on irradiance immersion factors and cosine response functions in water and\nair.\nThe filter radiometers appearing in Tables 3.3 and 3.4 are the:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOCR-100: A 7-channel analog spectral radiance sensor manufactured by Satlantic, Inc.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOCR-200: A 7-channel analog spectral radiance sensor manufactured by Satlantic, Inc.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOCI-200: A 7-channel spectral irradiance radiometer, counterpart to the OCR-200, also manufactured by\nSatlantic, Inc.

In the examples given in this chapter, the HR-3\nis configured with collector optics to measure Es(\xce\xbb), Ed(z, \xce\xbb) and Lu(z, \xce\xbb) from 400 to 700 nm, with\napproximately 2 nm resolution in each variable.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMiniSpec: A series of Satlantic hyperspectral radiometers configured to measure irradiance (MiniSpec I)\nEs(\xce\xbb) or Ed(z, \xce\xbb), and radiance (MiniSpec R) Lu(z, \xce\xbb), from 350 nm to 800 nm with a spectral resolution of\napproximately 10 nm, sampled at 3.3 nm intervals.\n\nInherent Optical Properties Measurement Methods\nSome buoy instrument arrays incorporate sensors to measure inherent optical properties (IOP): the volume\nbeam attenuation coefficient c(z,\xce\xbb), the volume absorption coefficient a(z,\xce\xbb), and the backscattering coefficient\nbb(z,\xce\xbb), as defined in Volume I, Chapter 2 (Section 2.4). Given these IOP measurements, the volume scattering\ncoefficient may be calculated as b ( z , \xce\xbb ) = c ( z , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 a ( z , \xce\xbb ) .\nIOP sensors often used on buoys (Tables 3.3 and 3.4) include the:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAC9: An instrument manufactured by WETLabs, Inc. that may be used to measure the absorption\ncoefficient, using a reflecting tube to capture forward-scattered photons, and beam attenuation at 9\nwavelengths.

The backscattering coefficient bb(z,\xce\xbb),is then determined using a model\nrelating it to \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb,140\xc2\xb0; c ) (Volume IV, Chapter 5). Alternatively, one of the N channels may be\n\nconfigured to measure chlorophyll a fluorescence, rather than backscattering. On the MOOS buoy, for\nexample, a hull-mounted HS-2 is used to determine bb(z,532) and chlorophyll a fluorescence at a depth of\napproximately 1.5 m.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVSF: A device similar to the HS-N, but which measures \xce\xb2 ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xa8; c ) at 3 centroid angles,\n\xce\xa8 = 100\xc2\xb0, 120\xc2\xb0 and 150\xc2\xb0 , at a single wavelength, and determines bb(z,\xce\xbb) using a model of the VSF that is\ndifferent from that used with the HS-N (Volume IV, Chapter 5).\n\nProtocols describing methods for measuring these variables, including laboratory and field calibrations of\ninstruments and quality control measures, are described in Volume IV, Chapters 2, 3 and 5 for c(z,\xce\xbb), a(z,\xce\xbb) and\nbb(z,\xce\xbb), respectively. As with radiometry, the measurement protocols for IOP instruments on buoys differ from\nshipboard protocols in that they are usually placed at fixed depths, they are subject to biofouling during lengthy\ndeployments, and the instrument cleaning and field calibrations recommended for shipboard use can only be carried\nout before and after the deployment. Profiling moorings may mitigate bio-fouling problems by \xe2\x80\x9cstoring\xe2\x80\x9d the\ninstrument package in the dark at a depth below the euphotic zone.\nManov et al. (2003) review methods for reducing biofouling of IOP, as well as AOP, sensors. In particular,\nthey (OPL UCSB) have developed An anti-foulant copper tubing flow-through system was developed by USCB\nOPL for the ac-9 and HiSTAR (100-wavelength ac-meter) (Figure 3.14), for closed path flow-through fluorometers\n(WET Labs, Inc. WETStar) and transmissometers (WET Labs, Inc. C-Stars). The copper tubing systems were tested\non a mooring, at depths of 5, 11, and 20 m, during the Hyperspectral Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment\n(HyCODE) in productive inland waters off New Jersey, U.S.A (Chang et al., 2002). One-half inch copper tubing\nwas utilized to connect the intakes of the ac-9 to a pump. Between one-hour measurement cycles, copper from the\ntubing was allowed to leach into the water contained in the tubes of the instrumentation system. Prior to taking the\nabsorption and attenuation measurements, the pump was run on for 10 seconds to clear the system of the leached\ncopper and to pump non-contaminated water into the intake port for sampling. The pump was then left on during\nthe 70 s measurement period. Stainless steel screen filters were used to remove large particles, e.g., seaweed,\nmacroorganisms, and large detritus, from the sensor elements. Separate pumped water systems were utilized for the\nplumbing the WETStars and C-Stars. One-quarter inch copper tubing was utilized to fit the two instruments\ntogether and to a pump. Isolation of the copper by Tygon tubing (black tubing is used to reduce ambient light\nlevels) was made in order to avoid dissimilar metal corrosion effects with the sensors pressure cases, mounting\nbrackets, and the stainless steel instrumentation cage. Manov et al. (2003) concluded that copper-tubing based\nsystems provide biofouling protection superior to that achieved with chemically-based methods.\nIt is recommended to deploy one set of IOP sensors in the near-surface layer at a depth centered between those\nat which radiometers are placed to determine K(\xce\xbb) and LWN(\xce\xbb) (see above). If additional IOP sensors are deployed\nin an array, the usual practice is to distribute them to optically characterize the water column throughout the\neuphotic zone.\nThese guidelines are appropriate, though perhaps difficult to adhere to in practice. The GoMOOS moorings, for\nexample, deploy one set of IOP sensors at 3.5 m depth. This IOP package includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThree WETLabs VSF (440, 530, and 650 nm) volume scattering meters are integrated with a VSF3S\ncontroller that controls the sampling period for each of the 3 sensors, and collates the data from all 3\nsensors into a single output stream to the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s DH4 data logger, where sample period averages are\nformed. Each VSF sensor has a small copper shutter that covers the optical sensing area when not in\noperation, and rotates out of the way during the measurement period. The copper shutter sits about 1-2 mm\nabove the optical face. Copper foil tape is also wrapped around the outside of the sensor to deter growth.\n\n62\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOne WETLabs ac9 absorption and beam attenuation meter is used to measure a ( \xce\xbb ) and c ( \xce\xbb ) . Short\nlengths of copper pipe added to the the intake and outflow ends of the flow-through tubing (Fig. 3.14). The\ncopper pipe sections provide a toxic barrier on each end of the flow tube system to prevent biological\norganisms from entering the flow tube area when the pump is off between sampling periods. This system\nyields approximately 2-3 months protection before effects of biofouling begin to become apparent in the\ndata record. Bromide, or bleach, leaching methods are not used, because these reactive materials may etch\nof the quartz window surfaces during a several month deployment.\n\nFig. 3.14: Schematic diagram showing a bio-optical package with copper tubing\nused to protect the flow-through optical instruments from bio-fouling (after\nManov 2003).\nMethods for Other Measurements\nThe MBARI-ISUS (Johnson and Coletti, 2002) is a new system for the optical determination of nitrate\nconcentrations in situ without the use of reagents. The system has been successfully deployed on a number of buoys\n(MOOS-M1, TAO, and SOFeX). ISUS uses UV spectroscopic techniques to provide a measure of nitrate in a 1 cm\npath length cell in approximately one second. ISUS provides a real time nitrate concentration (in analog and digital\nformats) and optionally, a full UV absorption spectrum from 200-400nm. Real time nitrate concentrations are\naccurate to 2mM with a precision of 0.05mM. For moored systems, a novel antifouling chamber has been\ndeveloped by MBARI using a perforated copper tube and Nitex filter cloth over the probe.\nValidation Using Shipboard Measurements\nDuring any recovery, deployment, or servicing of optical moorings or drifters, it is strongly recommended that\nshipboard bio-optical and radiometric profiles of the water column be measured for comparison with the concurrent\nbuoy measurements. The appropriate measurements are those listed in Vol. I, Chapter 3, Table 3.1, where the\nprotocols covering each measurement are provided in the volumes and chapters indicated in Table 3.2, of Volume I,\nChapter 3. Examples of data sets used for this purpose are described in Dickey et al. (2001). In the present context,\nthe shipboard radiometric profile measurements made just after a drifting or moored buoy\xe2\x80\x99s radiometers are placed\nin the water, and just before they are recovered, provide invaluable information on the extent of biofouling during a\ndeployment and the quality of water-leaving radiances and diffuse attenuation derived from the buoy measurements.\nA similar suite of samples are collected off the Oregon Coast when optical drifters are deployed. In addition, a\ncalibrated Tethered Spectral Radiometer Buoy (Satlantic Inc.) is used to collect optical data in the vicinity of the\ndrifters for comparative purposes.\nIt is also useful to acquire in situ fluorometric chlorophyll a before or after radiometric profiles and optical\nmooring or drifter deployments. Samples to determine the chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficient (a*) are also\n\n63\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nimportant near optical mooring locations. Recently, strong emphasis has been placed on determining other pigments\nby means of HPLC analysis to confirm the fluorometric chlorophyll a and phaeopigment measurements (Volume V,\nChapter 3) and to quantify the influence that other pigments may have on remote sensing data quality.\nDuring MOOS and BTM mooring recovery/maintenance/deployments for example, CTD rosette casts are made\nto measure physical and biological water column attributes and primary productivity studies, and radiometric\nprofiles are measured. During equatorial Pacific mooring visits a SeaWiFS Profiling Multi-channel Radiometer\n(SPMR) profiles are measured and various water samples are collected for measurements of pigments concentration\n(Vol. V, Chapters 2 and 3) and absorption on filters (Vol. IV, Chapter 4).\n\n3.5 DATA BUOY OPERATIONS AND MEASUREMENT METHODS\nUpon determining the objective, location, configuration and instrumentation of the mooring or drifter platform,\nthe specific measurement and operation methods, logistics, and shipboard support must be determined.\nDeployment/recovery schedules and methods\nDeployment and recovery schedules for moorings and drifters will vary dependent upon the selected location,\navailable power supply, and at which expected rates of bio-fouling may significantly degrade sensor performance.\nFor example, MOOS moorings in Monterey Bay take advantage of maintenance visits every 3-4 weeks (sometimes\nby divers) to maintain the instrument integrity, check for bio-fouling, and replace power supply. The moorings\nundergo yearly recovery and deployments (turn-arounds) but have bi-annual instrument and OASIS controller swapouts dependent upon status. Each buoy, tower, and bridle (annotated with serial numbers) is checked for any faults\ncaused from corrosion and documented accordingly. The moorings are built in a staging area at MBARI and\nundergo rigorous testing before being deployed from the R/V Pt. Sur.\nIn the GoMOOS project, each mooring is on a 6-month duty cycle, during which time servicing or maintenance\nis performed on an as needed basis only. This is mainly due to programmatic cost limitations. Each mooring, buoy\nand associated instruments are completely replaced approximately every 6 months, depending on weather and ship\nscheduling. Thus, the operational goal of GoMOOS is deployments of 6 months without (or minimal) servicing. In\nterms of the optical sensors, the 6 month duty cycle is too long for most of the instrumentation due to the effects of\nbiofouling. In our analysis, the above water downwelling irradiance sensor, the chlorophyll fluorometers, and the\nVSF sensors performance over 6 months is acceptable, and most of the effects of biofouling can be removed or\nminimized using post-processing procedures and pre- and post-calibrations. However, the ac9 and the in water\nradiometric sensors do suffer from biofouling that is very difficult to account for using post-recovery processing\nprocedures. We feel that once an effective copper shutter system is developed, the in water irradiance and radiance\nsensors will be able to collect data over the 6 month duty cycle with only minimal effects of biofouling. The ac9,\nhowever, is in need of further anti-biofouling prevention above the copper pipe tubing system we use. The main\nproblem we are having is with the organic film that builds up over the first 2 months of deployment on the optical\nsurfaces. Originally we had proposed to GoMOOS to have divers service the optical systems every 2-3 months, by\nretrieving the optical packages off of the mooring, and then cleaning and calibrating the sensors before returning\nthem to the mooring system. In fact all of our in water optical packages can easily be removed from the mooring\nchain without having to retrieve the entire mooring (using a set of strongbacks and clamping systems) or interrupt\nthe hourly mooring sampling schedule (using under water protective cable connectors). However, again, due to\nGoMOOS programmatic cost limitations, this proposed servicing of the optical sensors was cut from the program.\nIn remote locations such as in the equatorial Pacific, TAO mooring visits may only occur every 3-6 months with\nannual turnarounds. Therefore, those moorings are designed to stay completely operational for one year without\nvisits. As a result of the schedule and deck space aboard the R/V Ka\xe2\x80\x99imimoana, the buoys are built, tested, and\ndeployed sometimes within a 24 hour time period. Prior to leaving port, all mooring hardware is checked for\nintegrity and serial numbers are carefully documented before deployment. Immediately following deployment,\nARGOS data transmission is verified and deployment locations are documented.\n\n64\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nAt the HOT/HALE ALOHA and BATS/BTM sites, monthly5 visits are made to the mooring location during\nregularly scheduled HOT cruises. After a thorough evaluation of biofouling and other considerations, it was\ndetermined an optimal duty cycle for the mooring (4-6 months).\nDrifters are generally deployed from ships, although some drifting bio-optical buoys are designed to be\ndeployed from aircraft.\nInstrument Controllers, Data Recording, and Telemetry Scheduling\nA critical aspect of any mooring or drifter platform is its instrument controller and its ability to perform in harsh\nenvironments (Section 3.4 above). The system must be configured to communicate with instruments, store and\ntransmit data. The availability of power is dependent on platform design and frequency of visit or deployment\nduration, which in turn structures the controller to operate at higher or lower sampling frequencies.\nThe equatorial Pacific, (EqPac) instrument controller and instruments are powered by two battery packs as\ndescribed in a previous section. The power consumption to sampling rate of all instruments is calculated so that the\ninstruments can be functional for a year. Typically, the OASIS controller commands optical instruments to measure\nirradiance and radiance at 15 min intervals from 6 am to 6 pm. At each 15 min sampling interval the anti-fouling\nshutters (Chavez et al., 2000) on the subsurface radiometer open for approximately 30 seconds and the radiometer\nsamples for 20 seconds. Data obtained between 10:00 and 14:00 local are averaged to provide representative daily\nreadings, and are then processed to obtain bio-optical parameters. In addition to the measurements during daylight\nhours, dark readings (00:00 local) are also recorded to provide a zero offset and information on the status of the\nradiometers. All of the data are stored on a hard drive within the OASIS controller and daily noon readings of\nselected instruments are transmitted via one-way ARGOS. The total data for ~6 months is ~3 Mb of memory.\nGoMOOS: The programmatic goals of GoMOOS are to provide hourly, near-real time data of all oceanic and\nmetereologic conditions from 10 mooring locations, with each mooring having a 6 month duty cycle before\nreplacement of the entire mooring. Each mooring has two 12V Glassmat (gel cell) batteries, and 4 solar panels,\nwhich provide power to the main buoy controller (Campbell Scientific CR10X), the cellular phone, and all\ninstruments with the exception of the deep optics package at 18 m, which is powered by a twenty-four 9V lithium\nbattery pack. Hourly sampling is done in \xe2\x80\x9cburst\xe2\x80\x9d mode, sampling between 20 seconds to 10 minutes depending on\nthe instrument. The hourly sampling intervals for each instrument were selected based on trade-offs between power\nusage, disk storage space, and temporal resolution. Each hourly sample period is initiated 10 minutes before the top\nof each hour and ends at 10 minutes after the top of the hour. During this period, each instrument is powered,\ncollects data, and reports the average data to the main data logger (Campbell system). Note that each instrument\nmay have a slightly different sampling interval. Almost all of the raw resolution data is stored by the main data\nlogger system, or stored by the individual sensors for later retrieval. All of the optics systems data loggers store the\nraw resolution data on a resident flash disk (64 or 192 MB). Transmission of the averaged hourly data samples from\nall instruments (including diagnostic information such as position, battery voltage, etc) is initiated between 12 and\n25 minutes after the top of each hour, with each buoy calling in at a different time frame. The main mode of data\ntransmission to shore is via cellular phone to a shore based modem.\nAt HOT/HALE-ALOHA and BATS/BTM sites, optical parameters are sampled at 20 min intervals and\nrecorded to a data logger (Letelier et al., 2000), and are telemetered to shore via satellite.\nAs another example, all instruments on the MBARI SOFeX drifter were connected to the logger/controller unit,\nwhich was a customized version of the OASIS system (Chavez et al., 1997). The OASIS internal power supply (28\nD-cell alkaline batteries) provided power to the controller unit itself and to all of the instruments except the ISUS\nand GasHound (Table 3.4), which were powered by internal batteries. Sampling frequencies of the instruments were\nselected to provide the best trade-off between temporal resolution and length of deployment, since battery life (as\nopposed to fouling) was the most important variable governing deployment duration. In addition to measuring\nbiological, physical and chemical properties of the surface waters, the other major purpose of the drifters was to\nprovide a Lagrangian framework for ship navigation around the Fe fertilized patch. Consequently, GPS data were\nacquired, and radio connections attempted every 5 min \xe2\x80\x93 these two processes were the largest drain on the batteries.\nData from all other instruments were collected at hourly intervals. At the temperatures of the Southern Ocean,\nbattery life was significantly shortened, and with the sampling frequencies just described, each drifter could be\n5\n\nThe interval between visits to the HALE-ALOHA mooring is likely to increase to 3 months in the near future.\n65\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ndeployed for at most 2 weeks before the package was recovered and new batteries installed. All data were stored in\nmemory (RAM) and transmitted via packet radio to the supporting ship when it was in range (~5 Km to 10 Km\ndepending on sea state). In contrast to equatorial mooring applications, no hard drive was included in this\nconfiguration of the OASIS.\nThe unique nature and increased vulnerability of profiling moorings can necessitate specialized logic on the part\nof the controller. Two way communications with a shore-based server allows the updating of mission and\nscheduling files. Amongst other parameters mission files can determine profile speed, the systems activated, and the\nminimum profile depth. Increasing the minimum profile depth is an effective method to prevent instrument damage\nduring bad weather. Inclement conditions may also be detected, for example, from the vertical motion of profiling\nvehicle and/or the wave height from bottom a mounted pressure sensor, and subsequently acted on by the controller.\nA default, or safe, mission program to be used by the controller in the absence of shore communication may be\nadvantageous. In common with other type of moorings a low-power standby mode can be entered between activity\nperiods. An example of a simple control sequence upon waking is:\n1.\n\nestablish communications with the shore station to check for updated mission or scheduling files,\n\n2.\n\nperform the profile, and stream some data in real-time,\n\n3.\n\npreprocess the profile data for telemetry, and\n\n4.\n\ntransmit this data to the shore station.\n\n3.6 DATA ANALYSIS AND QUALITY CONTROL METHODS\nAs described above, the data recorded by an array of sensors mounted on a buoy are retrieved either remotely\nvia a telecommunications link, or by directly downloading it when the buoy is visited for service or retrieval. As\nwith methods of measurement and instrument deployment (Sect. 3.4 above), many aspect of data processing,\nanalysis and quality control are already covered by protocols specified for similar shipboard measurements.\nRadiometric characterization and calibration requirements and conversion of sensor counts to irradiance and\nradiance units must follow the protocols described in Volume II (Chapters 2 and 3) and Volume III (Chapter 2), with\nadjustments to account for:\n1.\n\nin-water spectral irradiance and radiance measurements at only 1 to 3 depths in the water column,\n\n2.\n\nprolonged sensor operation for weeks to months without hands-on stability checks and cleaning, and\n\n3.\n\nbio-fouling of submerged optical surfaces, and contamination of above-water sensors by deposition of dust,\nsalt and/or bird droppings.\n\nSimilarly, IOP sensors are calibrated, and the data processed, analyzed and checked for quality, following the\nprotocols described in Volume IV, with adjustments for the special circumstances applicable to sensors deployed on\nbuoys.\nThe following subsections describe recommended methods for handling Above-Water Spectral Irradiance Data,\nIn-Water Radiometric Data, Absorption and Beam Attenuation Data, Backscattering Data, and Chlorophyll a\nFluorescence Data, respectively. The contents of each subsection describe procedures for Data Processing, Data\nAnalysis and Quality Control, in that order. In general terms:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cData Processing\xe2\x80\x9d covers conversion of sensor response counts to engineering and scientific measurement\nunits, including adjustments for pre- and post-deployment sensor calibration results.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cData Analysis\xe2\x80\x9d covers methods for determining derived quantities such as, for example, water-leaving\nradiance, diffuse attenuation coefficients, volume scattering coefficients and backscattering.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuality Control\xe2\x80\x9d describes methods for analyzing the time series of each measurement, together with\nderived quantities, for internal consistency, symptoms of instrument failure, symptoms of biofouling,\nconsistency with other on-board measurement channels and/or sensors, and consistency with external\ninformation (e.g. SeaWiFS water-leaving radiance spectra comparisons with measured upwelled radiance\nspectra).\n\n66\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nAbove-Water Spectral Irradiance\nA radiometer mounted above the water surface (Tables 3.3 and 3.4) is frequently used to measure incident\nspectral irradiance ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) at one or more wavelengths \xce\xbb, at times t programmed into a particular buoy\xe2\x80\x99s\nInstrument Controller (Sects. 3.4 and 3.5).\nData Processing steps, which may be implemented either in a buoy\xe2\x80\x99s Instrument Controller, or retrospectively\napplied to data downloaded when a buoy is visited for maintenance, or retrieved, include:\n1.\n\nDark counts, obtained by averaging data scans obtained at local midnight, are first subtracted from\neach channel.\n\n2.\n\nThe radiometer\xe2\x80\x99s spectral irradiance responsivity calibration factors are applied to convert darkcorrected counts in each channel into spectral irradiance units \xef\xa3\xae\xc2\xb5W cm -2 nm -1 \xef\xa3\xb9 . The calibration\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nfactors are obtained from pre-deployment responsivity calibrations, in air, using characterization\nmethods consistent with protocols described in Vol. II, Chapter 3 (Section 3.2). The detailed\nalgorithms by which these coefficients are applied are provided by the instrument manufacturer; these\nmay, or may not, include adjustments for detector temperature (if measured internally in the\ninstrument). In some cases, it may be appropriate to adjust the responsivity calibration coefficients to\naccount for differences observed in pre- and post-deployment calibrations; such adjustments must be\napproached with extreme caution, however, as changes in detector sensitivity are not necessarily linear\nover time.\n\n3.\n\nIt may be necessary, or desirable, to average ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) observations over a period of minutes-to-hours,\nand to transmit (or store) only the temporal average ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) .\n\nData Analysis:\n1.\n\nThe time series of spectral irradiance incident above the sea surface Ed ( 0+ , \xce\xbb, t ) \xe2\x89\xa1 ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) is obtained\ndirectly from the calibrated data.\n\n2.\n\nTo obtain downwelled spectral irradiance just beneath the water surface Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) it is necessary to\n\naccount for not only the downward transmission of Ed ( 0+ , \xce\xbb, t ) across the interface, but also the\n\ndownward reflectance at the interface of upwelled spectral irradiance Eu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) . The reader is\n\nreferred to Vol. I, Chapter 2 (Sect. 2.7)and Vol. III, Chapter 4 (Sects. 4.2, 4.4 and 4.6). From Vol. III,\n1\xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x81\nChapter 4, in particular, equation (4.11) gives the relationship Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\x85 Ed ( 0+ , \xce\xbb )\n, and\n1 \xe2\x88\x92 rR ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb )\n\nthe related discussion gives \xcf\x81 \xe2\x89\x85 0.043 \xc2\xb1 0.02 , r \xe2\x89\x85 0.48 , and 0 < R ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\xa4 0.1 .\n\nCombining this\n\ninformation for clear sky conditions and Case I waters, a useful approximation may be obtained as\nEd ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) \xe2\x89\x85 0.98 ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nQuality Control:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nInspect the time-series of raw data in each channel of the radiometer for bad data points (e.g. obvious\ndropouts), instrument failure, power failure, and symptoms of salt or other depositions on the\nirradiance collector.\nES ( \xce\xbb, t )\n\xcb\x86\nCalculate time series of normalized irradiance spectra ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) =\nand test whether the\nES ( \xce\xbb REF , t )\n\nshape of the spectrum, as defined by the relative magnitudes of normalized irradiance at all\nwavelengths, fall within limits defined by clear sky, partly cloudy and overcast models of incident\ndaylight. This is sometimes termed a \xe2\x80\x9crank-order\xe2\x80\x9d test between ratios for different wavelengths within\na given spectral measurement at time t.\n\n67\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n3.\n\nCompare the magnitudes of measured ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) to clear-sky model estimates ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) (e.g. Frouin et\nal. 1989, Gregg and Carder 1990) calculated for the solar zenith angle at each time t. Reject as suspect\nany measurements exceeding the threshold\nES ( \xce\xbb, t ) > 1.25 ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) .\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe factor 1.25 allows measured spectral irradiances to moderately exceed calculated clear sky\nirradiances due to reflections from scattered clouds. Although larger ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) values (up to factor of\n3) may occur under some cloud conditions (e.g. scattered cumulus), these large values are intermittent\nand will not persist over the averaging periods usually applied to buoy measurements.\n4.\n\n\xcb\x86\nCombining the previous two steps, the shape of each ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) spectrum should be consistent with its\n\nmagnitudes relative to the clear-sky model. In other words, if the magnitudes of ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) indicate\nclear-sky conditions, then the spectral shape should fall off significantly with increasing wavelength.\nAnd conversely, if relatively low ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) magnitudes suggest overcast conditions, the shape of the\nspectrum should be relatively flat and not decrease strongly with wavelength.\n5.\n\nExamine the ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) time series for consistency with the seasonal cycle of incident solar irradiance\nthroughout the period of the deployment.\n\n6.\n\nIf ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) is measured at 6 or more wavelengths consistent with the specifications of Volume II,\nChapter 2 (Table 2.1), it should be possible to compute an estimate of Photosynthetically Available\nRadiation (PAR) at each time t. As a further quality control measure, these PAR estimates may be\ncompared to independently measured PAR (if a PAR sensor is mounted on the buoy) and/or to regional\nPAR estimates modeled using cloud imagery measured using radiometers on geostationary satellites\n(e.g. Frouin et al. 1989).\n\nIn-Water Radiometric Data\nRadiometers are mounted underwater on moored and drifting buoys, in a variety of configurations, to measure\ntime series of upwelled spectral radiance Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) , downwelled spectral irradiance Ed ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) , and less often,\nupwelled spectral irradiance Eu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) (Sect. 3.4; Tables 3.3 and 3.4).\nData Processing: The initial steps in processing data from underwater radiometers are the same as for the\nabove-water spectral irradiance:\n1.\n\nDark counts, from local midnight scans, are subtracted from each the data for radiometric channel.\n\n2.\n\nResponsivity calibration factors determined in air are applied to convert radiance sensor counts to\nspectral radiance \xef\xa3\xae\xc2\xb5W cm -2 nm -1sr -1 \xef\xa3\xb9 and irradiance sensor counts to spectral irradiance\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xae\xc2\xb5W cm -2 nm -1 \xef\xa3\xb9 units. The above comments regarding ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) calibrations apply here also.\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n3.\n\nCalibrated radiances in each radiance sensor channel are multiplied by radiance immersion factors to\ndetermine Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) , and calibrated downwelled and upwelled irradiances are multiplied by irradiance\nimmersion factors to determine Ed ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) and Eu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) , respectively. The immersion factors for\nradiance are calculated based on the refractive index of the radiometer\xe2\x80\x99s window material, and\nimmersion factors for spectral irradiance sensors must be determined experimentally, following the\nprotocols described in Volume II, Chapter 3 (Sect. 3.5). The instrument manufacturer ordinarily\nprovides these factors, but frequently, only \xe2\x80\x9crepresentative values\xe2\x80\x9d for a \xe2\x80\x9ccollector class\xe2\x80\x9d are listed. As\npointed out in in Volume II, Chapter 3 (Sect. 3.5), immersion factors may vary up to 8 % between\nirradiance sensors of the same design and material specifications. To comply with these protocols,\ntherefore, an investigator must ensure that the immersion factors for each in-water irradiance\ninstrument have been experimentally characterized.\n\n68\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n4.\n\nAs with ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) , it is often necessary, or desirable, to average individual Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) and Ed ( z , \xce\xbb, t )\nmeasurements over periods of minutes, or hours. If so, clearly the averaging interval for the in-water\nand above water data must be the same. Averaging should be applied with caution, if at all, in\nsituations where bio-optical conditions (e.g. chlorophyll a concentration) at the measurement site may\nbe expected to vary significantly during the averaging period. When chlorophyll a variability during\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , 443, t )\nthe averaging period is large, Chl determined using, e.g.,\nin a remote sensing algorithm\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 ,555, t )\nis always an underestimate of the mean chlorophyll a concentration. This is a well-known, direct\nconsequence of the nonlinear relationship between remote sensing reflectance and absorption in\nseawater.\n\nData Analysis: methods are described to determine diffuse attenuation coefficients, water-leaving radiance,\nnormalized water-leaving radiance, and remote sensing parameters including chlorophyll concentration Chl.\nThe methods applicable to data from a particular buoy are determined by the available combination of\nmeasurements. Small, expendable drifters often carry only a single radiance sensor (e.g. a 7 wavelength\nSatlantic OCR-100) mounted beneath the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s hull (or flotation collar) at a depth zo \xe2\x88\xbc 1 m (for example the\nOSU SOFeX drifter illustrated in Figure 3.12). The MOOS (Fig. 3.3) and ARGOS (Fig. 3.5) moored arrays, on\nthe other hand, combine an Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) sensor (OCR-100) mounted immediately beneath the buoy hull with\npaired Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) and Ed ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) sensors at 10 m and 20 m depths. The GoMOOS optical moorings have\npaired Lu and Ed sensors at 3m, and an Ed sensor at 18m. Somewhat different data analysis schemes are\npossible with data from each of these and other radiometer configurations on a buoy. Zheng et al. (2002, 2003)\ndescribe procedures for the BTM data sets. In general, the uncertainty of derived quantities will be both lower\nand better understood for configurations with radiometers at several depths. Many of these uncertainties are not\nas important with profiling moorings, where virtually continuous profiles may be obtained and analysed using\nthe methods of Vol. III, Chapter 2.\n1.\n\nDiffuse Attenuation Coefficients K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) for Ed ( z , \xce\xbb ) and K L ( z , \xce\xbb ) for Lu ( z , \xce\xbb ) may be\n\ndetermined directly either from radiometric measurements at two depths ( zi , z j ) , j > i, or modeled,\nfrom ratios\n\nLW ( \xce\xbb m )\n\nusing remote sensing algorithms, as average values K ( \xce\xbb ) (denoted also as, e.g.,\n\nLW ( \xce\xbb n )\n\nK490 or K520, for wavelengths of 490 nm or 520 nm).\na.\n\nK 490 ( t )\n\nand\n\nLu ( zo , \xce\xbb1 , t )\n\nLu ( zo , \xce\xbb 2 , t )\n\n\xe2\x89\x85\n\nK ( \xce\xbb, t )\n\nLW ( \xce\xbb1 , t )\n\nLW ( \xce\xbb 2 , t )\n\nfrom\n\nwater-leaving\n\nradiance\n\nratios:\n\nAssuming\n\nthat\n\n, ratios of upwelled radiance from a radiometer mounted under the\n\nbuoy at a depth zo \xe2\x88\xbc 1 m may be directly substituted into satellite remote sensing algorithms\n-3\n\nto determine Chl concentration [mg m ] (e.g. O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly et al. 2000, Strutton et al. 2001) and\n-1\n\nThe remote sensing parameter\nK490 [m ] (e.g. Austin and Petzold 1981).\nK 490 ( t ) \xe2\x89\xa1 K ( 490, t ) is the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm averaged over the first\nattenuation depth, i.e. the depth where Ed ( z , 490, t ) is 37 % of Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , 490, t ) .\n\nGiven\n\nK ( 490 ) , the empirical algorithm and coefficient tables of Austin and Petzold (1986) may be\n\nused to determine K ( \xce\xbb ) at other wavelengths.\n\nMorel (1988) provides an alternative\n\nalgorithm for determining K ( \xce\xbb ) from remote sensing Chl.\nb.\n\nK d ( z01 , \xce\xbb,1) from ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) and Ed ( z1 , \xce\xbb, t ) : Given irradiances measured by radiometers\n\nlocated above the surface and at depth z1 [m], Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) is determined from ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) using\n\n69\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nequation (3.1), and the diffuse attenuation coefficient averaged from the surface to z1 is\ncalculated as\nK d ( z01 , \xce\xbb, t ) =\n\n(3.3)\n\nz1\n.\n2\n\nwhere z01 =\nc.\n\n\xe2\x88\x92\n1 \xef\xa3\xae Ed ( 0 , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n\xef\xa3\xba,\nln \xef\xa3\xaf\nz1 \xef\xa3\xaf Ed ( z1 , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nK d ( zij , \xce\xbb, t ) from Ed ( zi , \xce\xbb, t ) and Ed ( z j , \xce\xbb, t ) ,:\n\nGiven two underwater downwelled\n\nirradiance sensors at depths z j > zi , the diffuse attenuation coefficient averaged over that\ndepth interval is given by\nK d ( zij , \xce\xbb, t ) =\n\nwhere zij =\nd.\n\nzi + z j\n2\n\n\xef\xa3\xae E ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n1\n\xef\xa3\xba,\nln \xef\xa3\xaf d i\nz j \xe2\x88\x92 zi \xef\xa3\xaf Ed ( z j , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(3.4)\n\n.\n\nK L ( zij , \xce\xbb, t ) from Lu ( zi , \xce\xbb, t ) and Lu ( z j , \xce\xbb, t ) ,: Given two underwater upwelled radiance\n\nsensors at depths z j > zi , the diffuse attenuation coefficient averaged over that depth interval\nis given by\nK L ( zij , \xce\xbb, t ) =\n\nwhere zij =\n\nzi + z j\n2\n\n\xef\xa3\xae L ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n1\n\xef\xa3\xba,\nln \xef\xa3\xaf u i\nz j \xe2\x88\x92 zi \xef\xa3\xaf Lu ( z j , \xce\xbb, t ) \xef\xa3\xba\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\n(3.5)\n\n.\n\nIn principle, the uncertainties of the diffuse attenuation coefficients determined using (3.4) and (3.5)\nshould be better than that from (3.3), and the uncertainty associated with any of those 3 methods\nshould be better than the estimates of K ( \xce\xbb, t ) modeled using ratios of upwelled radiance measured\njust below the sea surface. If the measurement combination from a particular buoy is sufficient, it is\nrecommended that diffuse attenuation coefficients be calculated for comparison and quality control\npurposes.\n2.\n\nWater-Leaving Radiance LW ( \xce\xbb, t ) is determined by extrapolating upwelled radiance measured at\ndepth z to the surface as\nLu ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) = Lu ( z , \xce\xbb, t ) e KL ( z ,\xce\xbb ,t ) z ,\n\nwhere K L ( zi , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\xa1\n\n1\nzi\n\n\xe2\x88\xab\n\nzi\n\n0\n\nK L ( z , \xce\xbb ) dz .\n\n(3.6)\n\nUpwelled radiance is then propagated upward through the\n\n1 \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x81 ( \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xce\xb8;W )\n\nLW ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2, \xcf\x86 ) , for general viewing angles \xce\xb8\xe2\x80\xb2 > 0 [see Vol. I,\nn2\nChapter 2, (Sect. 2.5) and Vol. III, Chapter 4,]6.

Other approximations must be considered if there is reason\nto believe that optical properties vary strongly in the layer above depth z2.\nb.\n\nIf upwelled radiance is measured at only one depth, whether using a hull-mounted or wiremounted radiometer, and downwelled irradiance is measured at one or more depths, it can\nusually be assumed that K L ( z , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\x88 K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) within approximately 5 % (Kirk 1994). Then,\nK L ( zi , \xce\xbb ) may be determined using some combination of (3.3) and (3.4).\n\nc.\n\nIf upwelled radiance is measured only at depth zo, just beneath the buoy hull, then there is no\nchoice but to assume that K L ( z , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\x88 K ( \xce\xbb ) and apply remote sensing algorithms such as\nthose cited above under 1a).\n\n3.\n\nNormalized Water-Leaving Radiance LWN ( \xce\xbb, t ) is calculated from LW ( \xce\xbb, t ) following the definition\nof (Gordon and Clark 1981)7 as\nLWN ( \xce\xbb, t ) = LW ( \xce\xbb, t )\n\nFo ( \xce\xbb )\n\nES ( \xce\xbb, t )\n\n,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere Fo ( \xce\xbb ) is mean extraterrestrial solar irradiance (Neckle and Labs 1984) [see also Vol. I, Chapter\n2, equation (2.55) in and Vol. III, Chapter 4 (Sect. 4.1)]. If reliable measurements of ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) are\navailable, they are substituted directly in (3.8). Otherwise, incident surface irradiance may be\napproximated either as the modeled clear-sky irradiance ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) (e.g. Frouin et al. 1989, Gregg and\nCarder 1990) calculated for the solar zenith angle \xce\xb8o at time t, or more simply as\n2\n\n\xef\xa3\xabd \xef\xa3\xb6\nES ( \xce\xbb, t ) = Fo ( \xce\xbb ) tatm ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ) cos \xce\xb8o \xef\xa3\xac o \xef\xa3\xb7 ,\n(3.9)\n\xef\xa3\xadd \xef\xa3\xb8\nwhere at time t, tatm ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ) is the diffuse transmission of the atmosphere, and do and d are the mean\n\nand actual earth-sun differences, respectively.\n\nFinally, LWN ( \xce\xbb, t ) must be converted to Exact\n\nNormalized Water-Leaving Radiance by the methods described in Vol. III, Chapter 4.\n4.\n\nOcean Color Remote Sensing Parameters, Chl \xe2\x80\x93 chlorophyll a concentration in mg m-3 \xe2\x80\x93 and K490 \xe2\x80\x93\nthe diffuse attenuation coefficient in m-1 averaged over the first e-folding attenuation depth - are\n\n7\n\nGordon et al. (1988) introduced a variant definition of Normalized Water-Leaving Radiance that included an\nadjustment for the downward Fresnel transmittance of incident direct solar flux into the ocean. Although this\napproximation has the correct sign, its magnitude is not correct for a real ocean surface (even under calm\nconditions). Therefore, the Gordon et al. (1988) definition is not used, because it is inconsistent with the definition\nof Exact Normalized Water-Leaving Radiance (Vol. III, Chapter 4), which correctly accounts for downward\nirradiance transmittance through the sea surface.\n71\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ncalculated from ratios of either water-leaving radiance at different wavelengths, or more directly from\nratios of near-surface measurements of upwelled spectral radiance (e.g. Sutton et al. 2001).\nAlgorithms for calculating these parameters are cited in item 1a) above, as part of the discussion of\nmethods to determine diffuse attenuation coefficient.\nQuality Control:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nInspect the time-series of raw data in each radiometric channel for bad data points (e.g. obvious\ndropouts), instrument failure, power failure, and symptoms of biofouling.\nEd ( zi , \xce\xbb, t )\nL ( z , \xce\xbb, t )\n\xcb\x86\n\xcb\x86\nCalculate time series of normalized spectra Ed ( zi , \xce\xbb, t ) =\n, Lu ( zi , \xce\xbb, t ) = u i\nEd ( zi , \xce\xbb REF , t )\nLu ( zi , \xce\xbb REF , t )\nL ( \xce\xbb, t )\n\xcb\x86\nand LW ( \xce\xbb, t ) = W\n. Test whether\nLW ( \xce\xbb REF , t )\n\na.\n\nThe shapes of these spectra should be consistent with those of normalized spectra from\nprevious deployments in the site, and from earlier in the current deployment.\n\nb.\n\n\xcb\x86\nThe shapes of LW ( \xce\xbb, t ) spectra should be consistent with similar spectra of wavelength ratios\n\nin time-series of water-leaving radiances determined from SeaWiFS, MODIS, and other ocean\ncolor satellites.\nc.\n\nFollowing Abbott and Letelier (1998), set \xce\xbb ref = 555 nm\n\n\xcb\x86\nand use Lu ( z , 683, t ) and\n\n\xcb\x86\nEd ( z , 683, t ) to test for biofouling. In theory, if chlorophyll bearing organisms aggregate on\n\nor near the radiometer\xe2\x80\x99s window (or collector), the transmittance of the window (or collector)\nat 555 nm would be severely decreased while chlorophyll fluorescence on or near the surface\nwould continue to provide a significant signal. Abbott and Letelier (1998) suggest that\nbiofouling is indicated when either ratio exceeds 0.1, a value appropriate for clear\noligotrophic water masses. In very productive coastal water masses, a threshold of 0.5 may\n\xcb\x86\nbe more appropriate. A regional threshold may be established by comparing the Lu ( z , 683, t )\n\xcb\x86\nand Ed ( z , 683, t ) (555 nm reference) ratio history during each deployment to the extent of\n\nbiofouling observed when the sensor is recovered.\n3.\n\nCompare absolute values of water-leaving radiances derived from the buoy measurements with those\ndetermined from SeaWiFS and other satellite ocean color sensors. These comparisons are best done in\na time-series mode to detect outliers, and divergences indicating the onset and growth of biofouling\norganisms on the optical surface. Caution must be used in this method if the in situ data are collected\nin regions that are characterized by Case 2 water types with high concentrations of colored dissolved\nand particulate organic matter, relative to to phytoplankton pigment concentration. Moreover, the\natmospheric correction procedure used by SeaWiFS, and other ocean color sensors, may underestimate\nthe normalized water leaving radiance estimates in Case 2 waters.\n\n4.\n\nExamine diffuse attenuation coefficients calculated from the data\na.\n\nCheck whether K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x89\xa5 aw ( \xce\xbb ) , where aw ( \xce\xbb ) is the spectral volume absorption coefficient\nof pure water [Vol. I, Chapter 2 (Sect. 2.5) and references cited therein].\nIf\n0 < \xef\xa3\xae aw ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 K ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 \xe2\x89\xa4 0.005 m -1 , flag the data as suspect, but if \xef\xa3\xae aw ( \xce\xbb ) \xe2\x88\x92 K ( \xce\xbb ) \xef\xa3\xb9 > 0.005 m -1\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nthe diffuse attenuation coefficients are clearly bad data. If such conditions persist, it is likely\nthat one of the radiometric channels used to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient has\neither failed, or has experienced significant biofouling. In MBARI\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the\nequatorial Pacific, less than 5% of the calculated data fail this test, and this percentage should\nbe less in mesotrophic or eutrophic waters. Measurements not meeting this criterion usually\noccur during extremely cloudy or overcast days, and are possibly result from unresolved\nincident irradiance variability during the 4-hour period over which the data are averaged.\n\n72\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nb.\n\nWhen the data permit, compare diffuse attenuation coefficients calculated by the different\nmethods outlined above to determine internal offsets and uncertainties in the data set. These\ncomparisons can also be used, in time series mode, to detect the onset and extent of biofouling\nin different radiometers. Fig. 3.15, shows time series of K d ( z0i , 490, t ) for a 5 month MOOS\nbuoy deployment in Monterey Bay. The three time series were computed using equation (3.3)\nwith surface values determined from ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) in (3.1) and Ed ( zi , \xce\xbb, t ) for z1 = 10 m (top\ncurve), z2 = 20 m (bottom curve), and z3 = 30 m (middle curve). After approximately 2\nmonths, the 3 curves diverge in a manner that cannot be explained by optical stratification of\nthe water column, offering strong evidence of progressive biofouling of the radiometers at\n10 m and 30 m.\n\nc.\n\nWhen K d ( zij , \xce\xbb, t ) is determined from in-water measurements alone, i.e. independently\nfrom ES ( \xce\xbb ) , measures of internal consistency between in-water and the above-water\nradiometer may be calculated as the unbiased percent differences\n\xe2\x88\x86 0 k ( \xce\xbb, t ) = 100\n\nEd ( zk , \xce\xbb, t ) e\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 K d ( z0 k , \xce\xbb , t ) zk\n\n\xe2\x88\x92 Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t )\n\nEd ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t )\n\n%,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere k = i or j, and Ed ( 0\xe2\x88\x92 , \xce\xbb, t ) is calculated using ES ( \xce\xbb, t ) in equation (3.1). If running\nmeans and standard deviations of \xe2\x88\x86 0i ( \xce\xbb, t ) and \xe2\x88\x86 0 j ( \xce\xbb, t ) are calculated over a suitable\naveraging period - perhaps 2 weeks - the comparative time series may be used to provide\nadditional diagnostic indications of instrument degradation and biofouling.\n5.\n\nChl and K490 derived from ratios of water-leaving radiance should agree with the parameters\ndetermined from satellite ocean color data within approximately 35 % and 20 %, respectively. Fig.\n3.16 illustrates an example time series of Chl derived from the MBARI radiometers on the EP1 TAO\nmooring compared with Chl derived from SeaWiFS data and with chlorophyll a concentration from\nshipboard samples.\n\nFig. 3.15: An example of biofouling symptoms, as evidenced by the divergences in\nK490 over different depth intervals, beginning midway through a 135 day time series\nof radiometric measurements on a mooring in Monterey Bay, CA.\n\n73\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nIOP Data\nProtocols for data analysis and quality control of beam attenuation and absorption coefficients are described in\nVol. IV, Chapters 2 and 3, respectively.

For comparison, SeaWiFS derived Chl\nand in situ shipboard chlorophyll a concentration measurements for the mooring location are also plotted.\n\nChlorophyll a Fluorescence Data\nThe GoMOOS moorings use the WETLabs Inc digital ECO shuttered fluorometer (DFLS) series for all\nchlorophyll fluorescence measurements (Table 3.3). This instrument is low power, stable, and has a copper shutter\nto prevent biofouling. The sensor is wrapped in copper foil tape as an additional prevention measure. The epoxy\nfacing of the DFLS prevents calibrating the instrument against a chlorophyll standard dissolved in acetone.\nTherefore, the GoMOOS project calibrates the DFLS sensors against a dilution series of a monoculture of\nphytoplankton (T. pseudonana) in vitro, the chlorophyll a concentration of which is measured using the protocols of\nVol. V, Chapter 2. The fluorometer responses are fit to a linear regression equation as a model for converting the\ndata to chlorophyll concentration. Each DFLS is additionally characterized for stability (using a pure water\nstandard) and for temperature dependence using a controlled water bath. All sensors are calibrated against a dilution\nseries of phytoplankton and for the pure water offset before and after each deployment.\nData Processing\n1.\n\nTemperature correction of the linear regression offset is applied based on the in situ water temperature\nand the results of the temperature characterization.\n\n2.\n\nAverage digital counts reported to shore are converted to chlorophyll concentration units (mg l-1)\nbased on the linear regression equation from the calibration.\n\n3.\n\nUpon recovery of the mooring, the entire raw data record is analyzed again. For each hourly sampling\nperiod, the raw digital counts are are filtered using a 1.5 standard deviation filter and then steps 1 and 2\nare repeated.\n\nData Analysis\n\n74\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n1.\n\nUpon recovery of the mooring, the DFLS is recalibrated against pure water and 0.2 micron filtered\nseawater to check for instrument drift and for biofouling of the optical face. If significant instrument\ndrift or biofouling is detected, a linear correction is applied to the temporal data to account for these\neffects based on the pre- and post-calibrations against the phytoplankton dilutions.\n\n2.\n\nThe fluorometric chlorophyll concentration values are compared to Morel\xe2\x80\x99s chlorophyll estimates\nusing K d ( z , \xce\xbb ) values calculated from the downwelling irradiance data (see above). Comparisons are\nonly made between the average night time fluorometric chlorophyll data and the day time K d ( z , \xce\xbb )\nvalues in order to minimize the influence of fluorescence quenching of the fluorometric data. Note\nthat in many of the GoMOOS mooring locations, the surface fluorometric chlorophyll data time series\nshow a strong diurnal response, with high chlorophyll values at night and the lowest values at local\nnoon due to fluorescence quenching.\n\nQuality Control\n1.\n\nThe data are inspected to ensure that all values fall between minimum and maximum limits derived\nfrom the DFLS calibrations. Any data point that is outside of these limits is flagged as questionable\ndata.\n\n2.\n\nThe entire raw data set of chlorophyll fluorometric data is analyzed after recovery of the mooring and\ncorrections are applied based on the pre- and post-calibrations of the DFLS sensor.\n\n3.7 RECORDKEEPING AND DATA ARCHIVAL\nLogs and supporting documentation\nThe configuration of a mooring or drifter design and instrumentation can change continuously due to various\nupgrades between deployments. Therefore, concise documentation of deployment, maintenance, recovery and any\nchanges to instruments should be clearly recorded in both hard and soft copy format. Serial numbers should be\nissued to each part of a mooring or drifter to determine the life span of the hardware from eventual corrosion.\nInstrument serial numbers and calibration files must also be carefully documented and stored.

Harding, Jr.2, and Scott McLean1\n1\nSatlantic Inc., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\n2\nUniversity of Maryland, Center for Environmental Science, Cambridge, Maryland\n\n4.1 INTRODUCTION\nLow altitude, passive remote sensing of ocean color from aircraft spans nearly three decades and has used a\nvariety of sensors. The Multichannel Ocean Color Sensor (MOCS) was first used in field experiments in 1980-82.\nMOCS measured spectral radiances in twenty contiguous 15-nm wide bands from 400 to 700 nm. Early applications\nof a spectral curvature ocean color algorithm for chlorophyll a concentration, Chl [mg m-3], used data from MOCS\nalong the East coast of the US over a six-year period (Grew, 1981; Campbell & Esaias, 1983). The spectral\ncurvature algorithm (Sect. 4.4 below) was applied in real-time without calibration to estimate Chl. MOCS was\noperated with the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar (AOL) that combined active and passive radiometry and produced\nindependent estimates of Chl. Study sites for the comparisons included shelf waters of the western Atlantic Ocean,\nChesapeake Bay, Nantucket Shoals, and warm-core Gulf Stream rings. MOCS- and AOL-derived chl-a and in-situ\nmeasurements of chl-a from ships showed good agreement.\nThe successful retrieval of Chl using MOCS data and the spectral curvature algorithm led to the development of\na small and relatively simple ocean color instrument, the Ocean Data Acquisition System (ODAS) in the mid-1980s,\nsupported by NASA and NOAA. Following on the findings of Grew (1981) and Campbell and Esaias (1983) using\nequally spaced bands around MOCS band 7, ODAS was designed with three bands in the blue-green region of the\nvisible spectrum at 460, 490, and 520 nm. The instrument was specifically designed for missions on light aircraft, an\nattribute rare, or absent, in previous ocean color instruments. The goal was to enable repeat coverage with high\nspatial resolution on affordable, relatively slow flying platforms, thus to move from demonstration to operational\nmode in acquiring remotely sensed data on Chl in estuarine and coastal waters. The ODAS nadir-viewing radiance\nsensor was designed to collect data along a line-of-flight at a sampling rate of 10 Hz. It was equipped with Loran-C\nfor onboard navigation and was usually flown together with an infrared temperature sensor (PRT-5 or Heimann\ninstruments) to sample sea surface temperature (SST) concurrently with ocean color measurements. The early uses\nof ODAS were in waters of the middle Atlantic bight, and it subsequently received heavy use from 1989-96 in\nChesapeake Bay as part of the Chesapeake Bay Remote Sensing Program (CBRSP \xe2\x80\x93 http://www.cbrsp.org). Nearly\n150 flights were conducted with ODAS to study seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton biomass and\nprimary productivity in the Bay.\n\n4.2 MEASUREMENT METHODS\nKey operational attributes of ODAS flights were low altitude (150 m), low speed (100 knots = 50 m s-1), and\nschedules timed to avoid high sun angles (flights conducted at 08:30 \xe2\x80\x93 10:30 h and 14:30 \xe2\x80\x93 16:30 h local time), high\n\n79\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nwind speeds (>7 m s-1) and variable cloud cover. Frequent coordination with shipboard sampling yielded a\nvalidation data set spanning a period of six years and covering a wide range of hydrographic conditions.\nThe routine use of passive remote sensing of ocean color from aircraft continues in a variety of locations,\nincluding Chesapeake Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, the middle Atlantic Bight, and several\ncoastal sites in East Asia. These programs now use commercial sensors8 mounted on light aircraft and helicopters.\nThe SeaWiFS Aircraft Simulator (SAS) manufactured by Satlantic, Inc., of Halifax, Nova Scotia is used by a\nnumber of these programs. CBRSP, for example, currently flies routinely a SAS III, a 13-band radiometer, to\ncontinue the 1989-present time-series for Chesapeake Bay. This generation of sensors is nadir-viewing, simple to\noperate, uses GPS for navigation, and records data to a PC. Survey flights using single- or twin-engine aircraft are\nconducted in clear-sky conditions, to the extent possible, at 150 m altitude using single- or twin-engine aircraft.\nThe surface glint (sun and sky glint) is determined largely by observation geometry and solar zenith angle. The\namount of sun-glint entering the sensor is affected by wind speed and orientation of the sensor relative to the sun.\nThe sky-glint contribution increases radically with increasing observation nadir angle \xce\xb8, and off-nadir viewing\nmeasurements in a direction near the solar azimuth will be totally saturated by sun glint., Practical arrangements for\nmounting ocean color radiometers on aircraft often make it difficult to adjust observation angles relative to the sun,\nand therefore, a nadir viewing angle (\xce\xb8 = 0) is the preferred - or at least the default - pointing direction for these\ninstruments. Sun-glint may be reduced, or avoided, by choosing an appropriate time to make remote sensing\nobservations, i.e., by collecting data only when solar zenith angles are greater than 30\xc2\xb0 (Bukata et al. 1995). The\nprobability of seeing the direct sun-glint can be estimated from the Cox and Munk model (1954) as a function of\nwind speed and solar zenith angle. If possible, a radiometer should be mounted on top of the aircraft to measure\nzenith sky radiance Lsky ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x80 ) , and/or global incident irradiance at flight level, to aid in glint removal and\nnormalization of the nadir radiance measurements. Methods for correcting airborne nadir-viewing radiance\nmeasurements for sun and sky glint are presented below in Sect. 4.3.\n\n4.3 RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION METHODS FOR AIRBORNE OCEAN\nCOLOR RADIANCE MEASUREMENTS\nThe total radiance Lt sensed at altitude h Km by a radiometer pointed at the sea surface contains contributions\nfrom atmospheric scattering, and surface reflection, in addition to the desired water-leaving radiance. It may be\npartitioned and expressed as a sum\nLt ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) = LP ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) + t ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8; h ) \xef\xa3\xae Lsun ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ) + Lsky ( \xce\xbb , \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ) + LW ( \xce\xbb , \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8 o ) \xef\xa3\xb9 (4.1)\nG\n\xef\xa3\xb0 G\n\xef\xa3\xbb\n\nwhere ( \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86 ) are the viewing nadir and azimuth angle (relative to the sun), respectively, \xce\xb8o is solar zenith angle, t is\natmospheric transmittance from the surface to altitude h, LP is atmospheric path radiance, LW is water-leaving\nradiance, and Lsun and Lsky are surface sun and sky glint, respectively. The first problem connected with the\nG\nG\natmospheric correction of data remotely sensed at different altitudes is the definition and evaluation of the\nabsorption and scattering processes due to atmospheric constituents as a function of flight altitude. The second\nproblem involves surface glint correction.\nAtmospheric Attenuation\nThe atmospheric attenuation by absorption and scattering is defined through the optical thickness of\natmospheric constituents (permanent gases, aerosols, ozone and water vapor). The optical thickness \xcf\x84 ( \xce\xbb, h ) of the\natmospheric layer between the sensor at altitude h and the sea surface is expressed as the sum of individual optical\n\n8\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this document to foster understanding.\nSuch identification does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, nor does it imply that the materials or equipment identified are necessarily the best available for the\npurpose.\n80\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nthicknesses of air molecules \xcf\x84R ( \xce\xbb, h ) (Rayleigh optical thickness), aerosols \xcf\x84A ( \xce\xbb, h ) , water vapor \xcf\x84W ( \xce\xbb, h ) and\nozone \xcf\x84O3 ( \xce\xbb, h ) , i.e.\n\xcf\x84 ( \xce\xbb , h ) = \xcf\x84 R ( \xce\xbb , h ) + \xcf\x84 A ( \xce\xbb , h ) + \xcf\x84 W ( \xce\xbb , h ) + \xcf\x84 O3 ( \xce\xbb , h ) .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe total transmittance of the atmospheric layer between the sensor and the sea surface is then computed as\n\xef\xa3\xae \xcf\x84 ( \xce\xbb, h ) \xef\xa3\xb9\n(4.3)\nt ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8; h ) = exp \xef\xa3\xaf \xe2\x88\x92\n\xef\xa3\xba.\n\xef\xa3\xb0 cos \xce\xb8 \xef\xa3\xbb\nThe parameterization of optical thickness as a function of altitude for permanent gases, ozone and water vapor,\nin terms of meteorological parameters (temperature, due point temperature, relative humidity, ozone concentration)\ncan be found in Guzzi et al. (1987), Zibordi et al. (1990a,b) and references within. In contrast, the aerosol optical\nthickness cannot be parameterized because the aerosol is highly variable in time and space, and is, in general,\nunknown in remote sensing experiments. Aerosol optical thickness can be evaluated either from models (Shettle and\nFenn 1979), or deduced from the remote sensing data itself as an unknown during iteration procedures of a\ncorrection algorithm (Guzzi et al. 1987, Zibordi and Maracci 1988, Zibordi et al.1990), or by direct measurements\n(Maracci and Zibordi 1990).\n\nAtmospheric Path Radiance\nPath radiance LP ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) can be partitioned into the sum of independent contributions due to molecular\nscattering, called Rayleigh radiance LR ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) , and scattering by aerosols, called aerosol radiance\nLA ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) , i.e.\nLP ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) = LR ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) + LA ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) .\n\n(4.4)\n\nThe partitioning in the form of (4.4) assumes that the single scattering approximation can be applied with no\ninteraction between scattering by air molecules and aerosols (Gordon 1978). This assumption is especially\nreasonable at measurement altitudes h \xe2\x89\xa4 1 Km .\nRayleigh scattering is wavelength dependent and varies in proportion to \xce\xbb-4. The Rayleigh path radiance\noriginating in the atmosphere below the sensor at altitude h can be written as (Bukata et al. 1995, Guzzi et al. 1987)\nLR ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) =\n\nEsun ( \xce\xbb; h ) t ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8; h ) \xcf\x84R ( \xce\xbb, h ) PR ( \xcf\x88 )\n\n,\n(4.5)\ncos \xce\xb8\n4\xcf\x80\nwhere Esun ( \xce\xbb; h ) is direct solar irradiance incident at altitude h, \xcf\x88 = \xcf\x88 ( \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ) is the scattering angle [see Vol. I,\nCh. 2, equation (2.5)], and PR ( \xcf\x88 ) is the Rayleigh scattering phase function, giving the angular distribution of\nscattered energy (normalized to 4\xcf\x80),9\nPR ( \xcf\x88 ) =\n\n3 (1 + cos 2 \xcf\x88 )\n\n.\n(4.6)\n4\nThe atmospheric molecular optical thickness \xcf\x84R ( \xce\xbb, h ) , as a function of flight altitude, can be obtained\napproximately through relations proposed by Van Stokkom and Guzzi (1984)\n\xcf\x84R ( \xce\xbb, h ) = 0.0088H R ( h ) \xce\xbb \xe2\x88\x924.15+ 0.2 \xce\xbb ,\n\n(4.7)\n\n9\n\nThe molecular scattering phase functions for air and water are the same, neglecting the depolarization properties\nof the two media. Compare (4.6) to equation (2.29) in Vol. I, Chapter 2, where the molecular scattering phase\nfunction for pure water is denoted \xce\xb2w ( \xcf\x88 ) . The standard practice in the ocean optics community is to normalize the\n\nintegral of the molecular phase function to unity, whereas the practice in the atmospheric community is to normalize\nP (\xcf\x88)\nit to 4\xcf\x80. Thus, \xce\xb2w ( \xcf\x88 ) = R\n.\n4\xcf\x80\n\n81\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nwhere \xce\xbb is in \xc2\xb5m, h is in Km, and the funtion HR(\xce\xbb) is\nH R ( h ) = 1 \xe2\x88\x92 exp ( \xe2\x88\x920.1188h \xe2\x88\x92 0.0011h 2 ) .\n\n(4.8)\n\nIn contrast to Rayleigh scattering, aerosol scattering is only weakly wavelength dependent, especially when the\nparticle size is large relative to the wavelength (McCartney 1976). The aerosol path radiance can be written as\nLA ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86, \xce\xb8o ; h ) =\n\nEsun ( \xce\xbb; h ) t ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8; h ) \xcf\x96 A ( \xce\xbb ) \xcf\x84A ( \xce\xbb, h ) PA ( \xcf\x88 )\n\n,\n(4.9)\ncos \xce\xb8\n4\xcf\x80\nwhere \xcf\x96 A ( \xce\xbb ) is the single scattering albedo [Vol. I, Ch. 2, equation (2.26)] for aerosols, and PA ( \xcf\x88 ) is the aerosol\nphase function. The optical properties of aerosols [ \xcf\x84A , \xcf\x96 A and PA ( \xcf\x88 ) ] are determined by the size, shape, complex\nrefractive index and concentration of aerosol particles in the intervening atmospheric layer; they can be estimated\nfrom the models for aerosol extinction in a marine boundary layer using relative humidity (Shettle and Fenn 1979;\nWong 1998; Winter 1994). A convenient, approximate analytic representation of the aerosol phase function is a twoterm Henyey-Greenstein function, using parameters for marine aerosol proposed by Gordon et al. (1983). The\nestimation of aerosol scattering remains the largest uncertainty in the remote sensing of ocean color from space\n(Gordon 1978).\nSurface Glint\nSun-glint outliers that are present in the data should be removed by filtering of the high-frequency records\nbefore any averaging is performed. The outliers are identified by the concurrent increase (often to saturation) of\nsignals in all bands. A common sun-glint filter entails rejection of outliers that fall 1.5 standard deviation above the\nmean value of a chosen data segment (Mueller and Austin 1995; Harding et al. 1992; Lazin 1998).\nTo the present, two methods for sky-glint correction have been applied to low altitude airborne radiometric data.\nIn the first method, sky glint is computed using sea surface reflectance \xcf\x81 ( \xce\xb8;W ) , where W is wind speed in m s-1,\nand incident sky radiance Lsky ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x80 \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86 ) . For a sensor looking at nadir, sky glint is computed as\nLsky ( \xce\xbb ) = \xcf\x81 ( 0;W ) Lsky ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x80 ) ,\nG\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere Lsky ( \xce\xbb, \xcf\x80 ) is zenith sky radiance. As elsewhere in this protocol document, the omission of explicit ( \xce\xb8, \xcf\x86 )\ndependence indicates nadir-viewing geometry. The dependence of surface reflectance \xcf\x81 ( \xce\xb8;W ) on wind speed W,\nsky radiance distribution, and solar zenith angle was modeled by Mobley (1999) for shipboard observations (Vol III,\nCh. 3), but this approach has not been used in airborne applications. For nadir viewing geometry, at any rate, surface\nreflectance \xcf\x81 ( \xce\xb8;W ) is essentially independent of wind speed W (Austin 1974; see also Vol. III, Ch.4). Some\nresearchers have used Fresnel reflectance for vertical incidence of 0.021 (Hoge et al. 1987). Ideally the zenith sky\nradiance should be measured because the prediction of its magnitude and spectral distribution from the models\n(Harrison and Combes 1988) is difficult and may have large uncertainties.\nThe second method assumes that the sky glint is proportional to the diffuse sky irradiance Esky ( \xce\xbb; h ) (Bukata et\nal. 1995, Lazin 1998) and can be expressed as\nLsky ( \xce\xbb ) = f1 ( \xce\xb8o ;W ) Esky ( \xce\xbb; h ) ,\nG\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere the factor f1 depends on sky conditions, solar zenith angle \xce\xb8o, and wind speed W. For Case I water where the\nwater leaving radiance at a red, or near-infrared, wavelength \xce\xbbo is approximately zero, the factor f1 can be computed\nas\nf1 =\n\nLt\xe2\x80\xb2 ( \xce\xbb o )\n\nEsky ( \xce\xbb o ; h ) t ( \xce\xbb o ; h )\n\n,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere Lt\xe2\x80\xb2 ( \xce\xbb o ) is the total radiance corrected for the atmospheric effects. For low flying aircraft, where atmospheric\neffects can be assumed to be negligible, it was found that f1 has approximately a constant value of 0.0087 (Lazin et\nal. 1996).\n\n82\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nThe diffuse sky irradiance Esky ( \xce\xbb; h ) for clear skies can be easily predicted from measured global downwelling\n\xcb\x86\n\xcb\x86\nirradiance ES ( \xce\xbb; h ) and the ratio of diffuse Esky ( \xce\xbb ) to global irradiance ES ( \xce\xbb ) obtained from a clear sky model\n\n(Gregg and Carder 1990, Bird and Riordan 1986) as\nEsky ( \xce\xbb; h ) =\n\n\xcb\x86\nEsky ( \xce\xbb )\nES ( \xce\xbb; h ) .\n\xcb\x86\nE (\xce\xbb)\n\n(4.13)\n\nS\n\nThe input parameters in the clear sky models are solar zenith angle, ozone scale height and meteorological data\n(pressure, temperature, dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility) that, ideally, should be\nmeasured on board the aircraft. The ozone scale height can be estimated from climatological, or satellite, data for\nthat region.\nWater-Leaving Radiance from Low-Altitude Radiance Measurements\nIn the case of flight altitudes 150-300 m, and typical clear sky/low wind conditions the radiance scattered by\naerosol is usually an order of magnitude less than the signal measured on the aircraft and therefore can be neglected.\nAdditionally, the aerosol scattering has very little wavelength dependence and would not greatly affect the spectral\ndistribution of the signal. On the contrary, Rayleigh scattering contributes more in the blue part of the spectrum and\ntherefore cannot be neglected even for low flight altitudes. The transmittance of the atmospheric layer between the\nsensor and the sea surface is usually close to 1 and for the altitudes up to 300 m the intervening atmospheric layer\ncan be considered transparent (Lazin 1998). In that case the remote sensing equation simplifies to the following\nform\nLt ( \xce\xbb; h ) = LR ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ; h ) + Lsun ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ) + Lsky ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ) + Lw ( \xce\xbb, \xce\xb8o ; h ) ,\nG\nG\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhere the Rayleigh contribution is computed using equations (4.5) through (4.8), the sun-glint outliers are filtered\nout, and the sky glint is computed by one of the methods described in the previous subsection.\n\n4.4 CHLOROPHYLL a DETERMINATION\nWater-Leaving Radiance Ratio Algorithms\nIf corrected water-leaving radiances are determined, via equation (4.14), from airborne radiance measurements\nat appropriate wavelengths, their ratios may be used in SeaWiFS, MODIS or other satellite ocean color remote\nsensing algorithms to determine Chl and/or the diffuse attenuation coefficient K490. Reviews of available\nalgorithms of these types are beyond the scope of this protocol document.\nSpectral Curvature Algorithm\nA detailed description of the theoretical basis for the spectral curvature algorithm was given by Campbell and\nEsaias (1983), including a summary of the advantages over radiance ratio algorithms in several respects. The\nalgorithm removes, or lessens, much of the \xe2\x80\x9cextraneous variation\xe2\x80\x9d (solar zenith, atmospheric transmittance) in\nremote sensing data collected at low altitude.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpectral Curvature\xe2\x80\x9d is characterized by the inflection ratio G ( \xce\xbb1 , \xce\xbb 2 , \xce\xbb 3 ) determined from the triplet of\nspectral radiances \xef\xa3\xae L ( \xce\xbb1 ) , L ( \xce\xbb 2 ) , L ( \xce\xbb 3 ) \xef\xa3\xb9 as\n\xef\xa3\xb0\n\xef\xa3\xbb\nG ( \xce\xbb1 , \xce\xbb 2 , \xce\xbb 3 ) =\n\nwhere \xce\xbb1 < \xce\xbb 2 < \xce\xbb 3 and ideally \xce\xbb 2 =\n\nL ( \xce\xbb2 )\n\n2\n\nL ( \xce\xbb1 ) L ( \xce\xbb 3 )\n\n(4.15)\n\n\xce\xbb1 + \xce\xbb 3\n.\n2\n\nThe form of the spectral curvature algorithm for chlorophyll a concentration Chl is\nlog10 Chl = a + bilog10 G ( \xce\xbb1 , \xce\xbb 2 , \xce\xbb 3 ) ,\n\n83\n\n(4.16)\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nwhere the coefficients a and b are depend on aircraft altitude, the specific type of radiance measurement used in\n(4.15), and the wavelengths of the measurements. The algorithm is relatively insensitive to other variables such as\nsolar elevation (Campbell and Esaias 1983).\n\n4.5 DISCUSSION\nGrew (1981) substituted raw spectral data (instrument outputs in digital counts) to compute inflection ratios\nG ( \xce\xbb1 , \xce\xbb 2 , \xce\xbb 3 ) [Eq. (4.15)], for three fixed MOCS channels having between-band wavelength intervals of 30 nm.\nCampbell and Esaias (1983) reported significant differences in inflection ratio spectra for \xe2\x80\x9cgreener\xe2\x80\x9d and more turbid\nwaters related to mixtures of absorbing and scattering materials. The presence and abundance of Chl dramatically\ninfluenced the spectrum, as shown in their Fig. 1 for blue water and in green water normalized to the blue water\nspectrum in their Fig. 2. The effect of Chl on the inflection ratio was very pronounced at MOCS band 12, centered at\n568 nm, but Grew reported a more reliable indicator of Chl was the inflection ratio of MOCS band 7, centered at\n490 nm.\nChl recoveries from ODAS data used calibrated total radiances Lt ( \xce\xbb ) from the three bands in a spectral\ncurvature algorithm, as per MOCS. Raw counts were substituted into the curvature algorithm to generate a\npreliminary, real-time Chl output during each flight. The coefficients, of the algorithm were derived by regression\nanalysis of 120 matched pairs of ODAS derived G ( 460, 490,520 ) curvature parameters (inflection ratios) and insitu chlorophyll a measurements; the two data types were considered \xe2\x80\x9cmatched\xe2\x80\x9d if the measurements were made\nwithin 24 h of one another in locations separated by no more than 0.01o Latitude and 0.005o Longitude. These\nsamples were acquired, in 1990-95, from the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program monitoring cruises, spanning the entire\nmain stem of the Bay and a range of Chl concentrations from less than 1 mg m-3 to more than 50 mg m-3. The ODAS\nprogram is described in several publications (e.g., Harding et al. 1992a, 1994, 1995).\nTo date, the accuracy of water-leaving radiance obtained from low-flying aircraft has not been properly\nassessed. In one study (Lazin 1998) the agreement between Lw computed from airborne data using Esky for sky-glint\ncorrection, and the Lw measured in-situ by tethered radiometric buoy during overflights, was within 15 %, and the\nratio of remote sensing reflectances agreed within 3.4% for clear sky conditions. If no corrections were applied to\nthose data, the differences in estimated Lw were 40-130%, and in remote sensing reflectance ratios up to 34 %. It\nR ( 490; h ) Lt ( 490; h ) ES ( 555; h )\nagreed better with in situ remote sensing\nwas also found that the ratio RS\n=\nRRS ( 555; h ) ES ( 490; h ) Lt ( 555; h )\nreflectance ratios if no correction was applied to the airborne radiances, whereas ratios utilizing bands at 412 nm,\nand 443 nm showed significant improvement after correction, because of increased Rayleigh scattering effects at\nthese shorter wavelengths. For overcast conditions large disagreements in Lw and RRS ratios were observed\nregardless of corrections, suggesting that accurate airborne ocean color radiometric measurements are very difficult\nto obtain under overcast skies.\n\nREFERENCES\nAustin, R.W., 1974: The remote sensing of spectral radiance from below the ocean surface.

Consequently, errors\nin the measured top-of-the atmosphere radiance are magnified a factor of 10 in the determination of water-leaving\nradiance. Proper characterization of the atmosphere is thus a critical part of the analysis of ocean-color remote\nsensing data. It has always been necessary to calibrate the ocean-color satellite sensor vicariously, using in situ,\nground-based results, independent of the status of the pre-flight radiometric calibration or the utility of on-board\ncalibration strategies (Gordon 1998). Because the atmosphere contributes significantly to the measured flux at the\ninstrument sensor, both the instrument and the atmospheric correction algorithm are simultaneously calibrated\nvicariously.\nThe Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) (Clark et al. 1997; Clark et al. 2002a; Clark et al. 2002b), deployed in\nsupport of the Earth Observing System (EOS) since 1996, serves as the primary calibration station for a variety of\nocean-color satellite instruments, including the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) (Barnes et al.\n2000), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Esaias et al. 1998), the Japanese Ocean\nColor Temperature Scanner (OCTS) (Isaacman et al. 1999), and the French Polarization and Directionality of the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s Reflectances (POLDER) (Deschamps et al. 1994). MOBY is located off the coast of Lanai, Hawaii. The\nsite was selected to simplify the application of the atmospheric correction algorithms (Clark et al. 1997). Vicarious\ncalibration using MOBY data allows for a thorough comparison and merger of ocean-color data from these multiple\nsensors (Wang et al. 2002).\nMOBY uses an instrument known as the Marine Optical System (MOS) to detect radiation over the spectral\nrange from 350 nm to 955 nm. The MOS system contains two single-grating spectrographs, a blue spectrograph\n(BSG) to measure light in the near ultraviolet and visible from 340 nm to 640 nm and a red spectrograph (RSG) to\nmeasure light in the red and near infrared from 550 nm to 955 nm (Clark et al. 2002a; Clark et al. 2002b). MOS\nresides in the MOBY instrument bay located at the bottom of the buoy. It is connected by optical fibers to radiance\nand irradiance ports on the three MOBY arms (denoted Top, Mid, and Bot), located at different ocean depths\n(typically 1.5 m, 5 m and 9 m), as well as to a surface irradiance port. MOBY measures upwelling radiance, Lu, as\nwell as the down-welling irradiance, Ed. A fiber-optic multiplexer in the MOBY instrument bay selects which\nspectrum is acquired by MOS. As described in Clark et al. (2002b), these data are used to determine the waterleaving radiance, Lw.\nMOBY buoys are typically deployed for 3 months to 4 months, then retrieved for servicing and repair.\nDeployments are numbered sequentially. One MOS instrument, MOS204, is used for even-buoy deployments while\na separate instrument, MOS205, is used for odd deployments. The buoys are calibrated before and after deployment\nusing sources traceable to radiometric standards maintained at the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(NIST) (Clark et al. 2002a). During a deployment, the buoy\xe2\x80\x99s radiometric stability is checked using on-board\n\n87\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ncalibration sources and monthly lamp calibrations by divers (Clark et al. 2002a). The MOBY radiometric standards\nare monitored during the year using two single-channel filter radiometers, called Standard Lamp Monitor (SLM)\nradiometers, with filter channels at 412 nm and 870 nm. They are calibrated at NIST on a regular basis. In addition,\ntransfer-standard artifacts are deployed from NIST to the MOBY field laboratory on a yearly basis to validate the\ncalibration protocols and assess the accuracy and stability of the MOBY spectral radiance sources.\nThe generally stated uncertainty goal for ocean-color radiometry is 5 % (k = 1) for Lw, which results in an\nuncertainty of 35 % for chlorophyll-a (Hooker et al. 1993). This requirement for high accuracy places stringent\ndemands on the uncertainties in water-leaving radiance measurements with MOBY. The uncertainties of MOBY\nmeasurements of water-leaving radiance Lw \xe2\x80\x94 without accounting for the effects of stray light \xe2\x80\x94 are estimated to\nbe in the range from 4 % to 8 % (k = 1) (Clark et al. 2002a).\nSpectrographs are imaging systems with dispersive elements and multi-element detectors that enable\nsimultaneous acquisition of an entire spectrum over some finite spectral width. There are intrinsic limitations in the\nbackground signal originating from radiation scattered from imperfections in the optical elements in the instrument.\nThis unwanted background radiation, called stray light, while small \xe2\x80\x94 on the order of 0.01 % or less of the incident\nspectral radiance in a single grating spectrograph \xe2\x80\x94 can give rise to unforeseen errors, often much larger than\nanticipated, when the spectral distribution of a source being measured differs significantly from the spectral\ndistribution of the calibration source. Such a situation is routinely encountered in oceanographic measurements,\nwhere instruments are calibrated against incandescent sources with a peak radiance in the short-wave infrared\n(~1000 nm) and subsequently measure the radiance of the ocean, which peaks in the blue spectral region (~450 nm)\n(Fig. 5.1). Consequently, stray light, if not properly accounted for, can have a significant effect in ocean-color\nresearch (Clark et al. 2002a).\nMeasurements with the two spectrographs in the MOS systems can be compared in the spectral interval from\nabout 580 nm to 630 nm. In this spectral range the two spectrographs give different values for Lu or Ed at a common\nwavelength. In Fig. 5.2, Lu is shown for the Top (Top), Middle (Mid) and Bottom (Bot) MOBY arms. The\ndifference in the measured radiance in the overlap region is a function of depth, increasing for deeper-lying MOBY\narms. While the signal is small in this region (approximately 1 % of the peak radiance), the lack of agreement in the\noverlap region and particularly its dependence on the spectral distribution of the upwelling radiance are possible\nmanifestations of stray light in the system.\nTo look for stray light in MOS, the response of the two spectrographs in the MOS205 system to monochromatic\nlaser excitation was measured. In this experiment, lasers were directed into an integrating sphere and the radiance\nwas measured with each MOBY arm. For monochromatic radiation, the entrance slit is spatially imaged on the\ndetector. Ideally, no radiation falls on detector elements outside the image. In practice, the image is modified by\nscattered light within the spectrograph and every element in the array can in principle have a finite response to this\nmonochromatic radiation. Results for the two spectrographs are shown in Fig. 5.3. The spectra are similar for both\nspectrographs. There are three components to the image: a strong, sharp peak corresponding to the image of the\nspectrograph entrance slit on the CCD; a broad, peaked structure around the slit image; and a non-zero constant\ncomponent. These three components are similar to specular, haze and diffuse components of reflectance. The\nspecular component corresponds to the properly imaged radiation; the haze and diffuse components arise from light\nscattered in the spectrograph, principally from the grating. These two components are analogous to the spectral outof-band features commonly observed in a filter radiometer.\nIn certain spectral regions, additional features are observed in the CCD response. From physical examination of\nthe spectrographs, the additional peaks are associated with a higher order diffraction peak from the grating. Optical\nray-trace modeling of the system confirms this hypothesis. Representative MOBY images showing this reflection\npeak in the system response are given in Fig. 5.4. Note, for example, the secondary reflection peak centered about\npixel 160 (pixel 725) for light imaged onto pixel 195 (pixel 760) for the BSG (RSG).\nThis scattered light causes unknown but potentially significant errors in the measured up-welling radiance.\nConsequently, the MOS instrument was characterized for its stray-light response and the results incorporated into an\nalgorithm that was developed to correct its measurements for stray light. In Section 5.2, we describe the iterative\napproach used to correct a MOS spectrum for stray light. The derivation of the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s stray-light parameters\nis described in Section 5.3 and applied to MOBY data sets in Section 5.4.\n\n88\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 5.1.

When acquiring an\nimage, the signals from the central 384 pixels in each column are averaged and a 512-element array is generated\nfrom each spectrograph. The total signal from element i of a MOS CCD is given by the equation\nSi = \xe2\x88\xab ri ( \xce\xbb ) L ( \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere ri(\xce\xbb) is the spectral responsivity of element i and L(\xce\xbb) is the spectral radiance of the source being measured.\nNote that ri(\xce\xbb) is the spectral responsivity of element i when considered as part of the spectrograph and includes\neffects such as grating diffraction efficiency and mirror losses.\nFor monochromatic radiation, an image of the entrance slit is formed on the detector. Expressed as a function\nof wavelength rather than array element, this normalized spatial image function is known as the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s slitscatter function \xcf\x83 i (\xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) (Kostkowski 1979), with the \xe2\x80\x98exit slit\xe2\x80\x99 in this case determined by the array element\xe2\x80\x99s\nspatial width and \xce\xbbi is the wavelength of element i\xe2\x80\x99s maximum responsivity. There is a fixed relationship between\nthe excitation wavelength and the position of the image on the array. As the wavelength changes, the spatial image\nmoves across the array.\n\nKnowing this relationship enables us to determine the fraction of incident light at some wavelength that is\nscattered onto a particular element. For example, for the wavelength \xce\xbbex in Fig. 5.3, 0.01 % of the light imaged on\nelement 420 (BSG) is scattered onto element 300. Assuming each element in the detector array has the same\naverage spectral responsivity, the signal from element 300 to radiation at wavelength \xce\xbbex is 0.01 % of the signal from\nelement 420.\nFollowing Kostkowski (Kostkowski 1979), the total responsivity of element i can be approximated by the\nproduct of the slit-scattering function and the maximum responsivity of each array element ri (\xce\xbb i ) (Fig. 5.5)\n\n91\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nri ( \xce\xbb ) = ri ( \xce\xbb i ) \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) .\n\n(5.2)\n\nKnowing the slit-scatter function, we have a set of 512 coupled equations\nSi = ri ( \xce\xbb i ) \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) L ( \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb\n\n(5.3)\n\nthat can be directly solved for either ri (\xce\xbb i ) or L(\xce\xbb ) (provided the other variable is known) using a generalized\nleast-squares approach (Shumaker 1979). Approximate inverse solutions using Singular-Value-Decomposition\n(SVD) of the applicable matrices are robust and should be directly applicable to this system (Mueller 2002). We\nused a simpler, more intuitive, iterative approach utilizing the inherently discrete nature of the CCD response.\nSeparating Eq. (5.1) into an in-band (ib) and an out-of-band (oob) component and assuming that the source radiance\nis approximately constant over the in-band spectral width, Eq. (5.1) can be written as\nSi = \xe2\x88\xab ri ( \xce\xbb ) L ( \xce\xbb )d \xce\xbb + \xe2\x88\xab ri ( \xce\xbb ) L ( \xce\xbb )d \xce\xbb = L ( \xce\xbb i )Ri ( \xce\xbb i ) + ri ( \xce\xbb i ) \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) L ( \xce\xbb )d \xce\xbb ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nRi ( \xce\xbb i ) = ri ( \xce\xbb i ) \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb .\n\n(5.5)\n\nib\n\noob\n\noob\n\nwhere \xce\xbbi is the wavelength corresponding to the peak responsivity of element i, L(\xce\xbb i ) is the source radiance at \xce\xbbi ,\nand R i (\xce\xbb i ) is the integrated in-band responsivity of element i\nib\n\nMeasuring a calibration source of known spectral radiance, Lc(\xce\xbb), and solving for R i (\xce\xbb i ) in Eq. (5.4), the\nintegrated in-band responsivity of pixel i can be written\nRi ( \xce\xbb i ) =\n\nr (\xce\xbb )\nSi\n\xe2\x88\x92 i i \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) Lc ( \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb .\nLc ( \xce\xbb i ) Lc ( \xce\xbb i ) oob\n\n(5.6)\n\nThe second term on the right hand side of Eq. (5.6) is the stray-light contribution to the total responsivity.\nUtilizing the discrete nature of the spectrograph detector array and substituting Eq. (5.5) for ri (\xce\xbb i ) , a recursion\nrelation is developed for R i (\xce\xbb i )\nRi (\n\nn)\n\n( \xce\xbbi ) =\n\nSi\n1\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x88\x91R j(n-1) ( \xce\xbb j ) \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbbi \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb j ) Lc ( \xce\xbb j ) \xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbb ,\nLc ( \xce\xbb i ) Lc ( \xce\xbb i ) \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb oob\n\n(5.7)\n\nib\n\nwhere \xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbb is the pixel-to-pixel wavelength spacing and j extends over all 512 elements of the array. The original\ninput values to the responsivity are the signals divided by the radiance of the calibration source\nRi (\n\n0)\n\n( \xce\xbbi ) =\n\nSi\n.\nLc ( \xce\xbb i )\n\n(5.8)\n\nFollowing the above discussion, the radiance of a source with an unknown spectral distribution can also be\ncorrected for stray light. In this case, the relation is given by the expression\nSi\n1\n\xe2\x88\x92\n\xe2\x8b\x85 \xe2\x88\x91R j ( \xce\xbb j ) \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb j ) L( n \xe2\x88\x921) ( \xce\xbb j ) \xe2\x88\x86\xce\xbb ,\n(5.9)\nL( n ) ( \xce\xbb i ) =\nRi ( \xce\xbb i ) Ri ( \xce\xbb i ) \xe2\x88\xab \xcf\x83i ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb oob\nib\n\nwhere\nL(0) ( \xce\xbb i ) =\n\nSi\n.\nRi ( \xce\xbb i )\n\n(5.10)\n\nNote that the stray-light corrected responsivity must be used. A stable solution, with changes less than 0.1 %, is\nreached after 4 to 5 iterations. The solution is robust and insensitive to small variations in the input parameters.\n\n92\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nWavelength /nm\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n3\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\n102\n\nResponsivity /a.u.\n\n101\n100\n10-1\n10-2\n\n(c)\n\n10-3\n\n(b)\n\n10-4\n10-5\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nArray Element\nFigure 5.5.

MOS202 is a stand-alone system,\nknown as the MOS Profiler. It is a ship-board instrument used for bio-optical algorithm development and validation\nand is not directly associated with the MOBY buoy. MOS204 is used as the sensor in even-buoy MOBY\ndeployments; MOS205 is used in odd-buoy deployments. In principle, model slit-scatter parameters need to be\nindependently developed for each MOS and for each MOBY deployment, with separate factors for each MOBY\narm, each port (Ed or Lu), for the top Es port and for the bottom MOS port.\nExamination of the system response to monochromatic excitation showed that the different arms (both E and L)\nwithin an individual buoy had the same slit-scatter function. The normalized responses of the MOBY top, middle\nand bottom arms with MOS205 to monochromatic excitation are shown in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7. Measurements also\nconfirmed that the slit-scatter function remained the same before and after deployment for a particular buoy as well\nas from buoy to buoy for a particular MOS system. However, the slit-scatter function differs between MOS\ninstruments (Fig. 5.8). Therefore, we only needed to derive model slit-scatter function parameters for a single port\non a single MOBY arm for a particular MOS. The results were then extended to every MOBY arm, both Lu and Ed\nports, and the Es collector for a particular MOS system. Radiation entering the MOS directly from the bottom\nradiance port is imaged differently (Fig. 5.9) onto the CCD array. Consequently, the slit-scatter function parameters\nfor the bottom MOS port on MOBY are considered separately and are not addressed in this work.\nExperimental\nIn a spectroradiometer equipped with a single element detector, the dispersive element, e.g. the grating, is\nrotated while the detector is fixed. The center wavelength of the radiation imaged on the exit slit is a function of the\nangle of rotation of the grating. The instrument\xe2\x80\x99s slit-scatter function can be determined using a single fixed\nwavelength source and changing the wavelength of the radiation centered on the exit slit by rotating the grating in\nsmall steps.\nIn a spectrograph, the grating is fixed and the spectral selection determined by the image of the entrance slit\nonto a reference plane where the multi-element sensor is placed as well as the size of the individual elements in the\nsensor array. In this case, if we want to determine the system\xe2\x80\x99s spectral response over some finite spectral range, we\nneed a tunable, monochromatic excitation system. NIST recently established a tunable-laser-based radiometric\ncalibration facility for Spectral Irradiance and Radiance responsivity Calibrations using Uniform Sources, known as\nSIRCUS (Brown et al. 2000). In the SIRCUS facility, tunable, monochromatic, high-power lasers are fiber coupled\ninto an integrating sphere, producing a nearly Lambertian, monochromatic source that overfills the entrance pupil of\nimaging systems such as MOS. The radiance of the source is determined at any wavelength by an irradiance\nstandard detector, which is in turn directly traceable to primary radiometric standards maintained at NIST. A bench\nprototype of the MOS system was characterized and calibrated in this facility (Habauzit et al. 2003). The results\ndemonstrated the validity of the stray-light correction approach.\nThe imaging onto the MOS CCDs in MOBY is slightly different than in the MOS system itself (Fig. 5.9).\nConsequently, a piece-wise characterization approach would not work and the entire MOBY system had to be\ncharacterized. Because of the logistical problems associated with transporting an object as large as MOBY to NIST\nand to the SIRCUS facility, as well as time constraints imposed by the operational protocols developed for MOBY,\nit was necessary to characterize and calibrate the buoys in situ at the calibration facility at the University of Hawaii\nMarine Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.\nA fiber-coupled, laser-based integrating sphere source (ISS), similar to the radiance source in the SIRCUS\nfacility, was developed for use at the MOBY field site. The system consisted of a 532 nm Nd:Vanadate laser\npumping a Ti:sapphire laser for tunable radiation from 700 nm to 1000 nm or a dye laser with Rhodamine6G dye for\ntunable radiation from 565 nm to 615 nm. The Ti:sapphire laser was modified to enable intra-cavity doubling with\ndoubled output from 410 nm to 440 nm. An etalon was placed in the laser cavity to ensure that the output was\nnarrow-band (<0.01 nm). Fixed-frequency HeNe, Argon ion, and diode lasers were used for additional\ncharacterization at discrete wavelengths.\n\n94\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 5.6.

(b)\nexperimental setup in the calibration tent for measuring the ISS radiance with a collector on the middle\nMOBY arm.\n\n97\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nThe output from the lasers was sent into a laser power-controller/stabilizer to reduce power fluctuations in the\nbeam. Portions of the beam were also sent into a wavemeter to determine the wavelength of the laser radiation and\ninto a Fabry-Perot spectrum analyzer so that the mode structure of the laser output could be monitored. The lasers\nwere kept in an air-conditioned sea van and radiation was fiber-coupled into an integrating sphere in the MOBY\ntent. A portion of the optical fiber was placed in an ultrasonic bath to reduce effects of speckle in the measurement\nof the output of the ISS. From the sea van, the optical fiber was placed in a garden hose for protection and through\nan electrical conduit to the MOBY tent. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 5.10.\nThe sphere radiance was determined using a calibrated irradiance transfer-standard radiometer. The radiometer\nis a six-element silicon-transmission trap detector (Eppeldauer and Lynch 2000). It was calibrated for spectralpower responsivity by comparison against a cryogenic radiometer and was equipped with a precision aperture of\nknown area. The sphere radiance is given by the ratio of the measured signal to the trap responsivity times a\ngeometrical flux transfer constant GD\nLSphere =\n\nSTrap\nRTrap * GD\n\n,\n\n(5.11)\n\nwith GD given by\n\xef\xa3\xab A \xe2\x88\x97A\nGD = \xef\xa3\xac 1 2 2\n\xef\xa3\xad Z\n\n2\n2\n\xef\xa3\xb6 \xef\xa3\xab r1 + r2\n\xef\xa3\xac1 +\n\xef\xa3\xb7\xef\xa3\xac\nZ4\n\xef\xa3\xb8\xef\xa3\xad\n\n\xef\xa3\xb6\n\xef\xa3\xb7\n\xef\xa3\xb7\n\xef\xa3\xb8\n\n(5.12)\n\n2\nwhere we have Z 2 = r12 + r2 + d 2 , A1 (r1) is the sphere exit port area (radius), A2 (r2) is the trap aperture area\n(radius), and d is the distance between the two apertures.\n\nThe sphere was equipped with a silicon monitor photodiode. During MOBY measurements, the monitor was\ncalibrated for the sphere radiance over a spectral range of interest using the reference standard trap detector, and\nthen MOBY measurements were made. The monitor signal was recorded for each MOBY measurement.\nCommunication was established between the laser sea van and the MOBY tent using walkie-talkies or a marine\nband radio. It was important to properly couple the laser radiation into the optical fiber. During this alignment\nprocess, the monitor signal was continuously displayed on a computer in the MOBY tent. Coupling of the laser light\ninto the fiber was adjusted, and the effect on the monitor signal was noted. The laser was properly coupled into the\nfiber when the monitor signal was maximized. The monitor signal was displayed on a computer screen in the\ncalibration tent. Using commercially available software, the screen was also displayed on a computer in the sea van\nto simplify the fiber alignment process.\nSlit-scatter parameters were determined for the BSG and the RSG coupled to the MOBY arms. To properly\nmodel the slit-scatter function (SSF) for the stray-light correction (SLC) algorithm we need the following\nparameters: (a) the single pixel in-band area; (b) a fit to the OOB slit-scatter function; (c) model for the reflection\npeaks and (d) model for additional light scatted onto the BSG CCD from radiation in the spectral range from 640 nm\nto 690 nm. In the following subsections, the basic steps undertaken to derive model parameters for the slit-scatter\nfunction are outlined for MOS205/MOBY 219 middle arm Lu port for the BSG and RSG, respectively.\nMOS205/MOBY219 BSG in-band area\nThe stray-light correction terms on the right hand side of Eqs. (5.7) and (5.9) are divided by the normalized inband area, N. N is given by Eq. 3.3, where the integration is over a \xe2\x80\x98suitably defined\xe2\x80\x99 in-band area\nN = \xe2\x88\xab ib \xcf\x83 ( \xce\xbb i \xe2\x88\x92 \xce\xbb ) d \xce\xbb .\n\n(5.13)\n\nTo determine the in-band area, the laser output was changed in small increments (0.1 nm to 0.2 nm) from 590 nm to\n600 nm and an image was acquired at each wavelength. The raw data (ADU/pixel/s) were divided by the sphere\nradiance, then normalized to a pixel\xe2\x80\x99s maximum responsivity. The wavelength of each pixel\xe2\x80\x99s maximum\nresponsivity was subtracted, leaving each pixel\xe2\x80\x99s normalized responsivity, centered about a relative wavelength of 0\nnm, for three adjacent pixels, P420-P422. Fig. 5.11 shows the normalized in-band responsivity of these pixels.\nNumerically integrating the line shapes gives in-band areas for the three pixels that agree to within 1%. Changing\nthe limits of integration from \xc2\xb1 4 nm to \xc2\xb1 6 nm changed the areas by less than 0.2 %. Fitting to an analytical\nfunction also gave results in agreement with the numerical integration. The in-band area and associated relative\n\n98\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nstandard uncertainty are listed in Table 5.1. In-band scans were repeated over the range from 420 nm to 430 nm to\ndetermine the spectral dependence of the bandwidth. No dependence was observed.\nTable 5.1.

To determine the out-of-band (OOB) component of the slit-scatter function, the laser\nexcitation wavelength was fixed at the peak of the response of one of the in-band pixels and a number of images\nwere acquired and averaged. The OOB slit-scatter function is shown in Fig. 5.12. The spectrum, with the center \xc2\xb1 5\npixels masked, was fit to a double exponential of the form\ny = m1 exp ( \xe2\x88\x922 x \xe2\x88\x92 x0 ) / m2 ) + m3 ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nwhere x = column number and xo is the column number with the peak response to the excitation wavelength, and the\nmi\xe2\x80\x99s are constants determined from the fit. The fit is shown by the solid line in Fig. 5.12, and fit parameters are\nlisted in Table 5.1. Note that there is an apparent 2-pixel shift in the center pixel between the imaged peak (centered\nat column 419) and the fit peak (xo = 421). This shift is ignored in the model of the slit-scatter function.\nMOS205/MOBY219 BSG Reflection peaks\nThe amount of light scattered onto the CCD in this reflection peak is significant. It is therefore necessary to\ninclude a model for these peaks in the general model for the slit-scatter function. For the model, we want to know\nwhat fraction of the incident light imaged onto some pixel is measured by the pixel under consideration. The\nmodeling is complicated by the fact that the reflection peak area is a strong function of position and the rate at which\nit moves across the CCD with changing wavelength differs from the primary image.\nTo model the incident light scattered onto a particular pixel, we first need the relationship between the reflection\npeak position and the excitation peak position. This relationship, shown in Fig. 5.13, was fit to a linear regression,\ngiven by the solid line in the figure. Values are given in Table 5.1.\nTo calculate the fraction of the incident light that is in the reflection peak, we want to compare the integrated\nareas of the reflection peaks to the areas of the fundamental peak. The primary peaks in the data set are first\n\n99\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nnormalized to 1. The relative reflection peak data, plotted as a function of separation from the primary image (in\npixels), are shown in Fig. 5.14. There is a large variance in both the amplitude and the total area under each\nreflection peak, but we need to consider that not all excitation wavelengths were centered on a pixel\xe2\x80\x99s response, so\nthe reflection peaks may not be properly normalized to a pixel\xe2\x80\x99s peak response. Consequently, it was necessary to\ncorrect the amplitude of the reflection peaks in Fig. 5.14 for the excitation offset.\nThe in-band data set was fit to a Gaussian distribution given by\n\xef\xa3\xab 1 \xef\xa3\xab x \xe2\x88\x92 p \xef\xa3\xb62 \xef\xa3\xb6\n2\ny = po + p1 exp \xef\xa3\xac \xe2\x88\x92 \xef\xa3\xac\n\xef\xa3\xb7 \xef\xa3\xb7,\n\xef\xa3\xac 2 \xef\xa3\xad p3 \xef\xa3\xb8 \xef\xa3\xb7\n\xef\xa3\xad\n\xef\xa3\xb8\nwhere the pi\xe2\x80\x99s are constants determined from the fit.\n\n(5.15)\n\nWe get a reasonable fit, shown in Fig. 5.15, though the area is slightly underestimated because the fit does not\nrepresent the right-hand shoulder well. The calculated area from the Gaussian fit agrees with the numerically\nintegrated value to within 1 %. In Eq. (5.15), p1 is the amplitude; p2 is the center or offset; and p3 is the width. To\ncorrect the excitation peak, we fit the primary image for the reflection peak data set to a Gaussian lineshape with a\nfixed width determined by the in-band fit. Note that to obtain the proper width for the fitting routine, it is necessary\nto convert the width from wavelength to pixel by dividing the width (nm) determined by the fit in Fig. 5.15 by the\npixel-to-pixel spacing of the BSG (0.58 nm/pixel).\nWith the width fixed, we are only concerned with the amplitude determination (or the value of p1) in Eq. 3.4.\nEach primary image peak was fit to Eq. (5.15), and results are summarized in Table 5.1. Corrections as large as\n26 % are applied to the reflectance peak amplitude data set. Note that there is often a small shift in the peak position\nas well. The shift is less than 0.5 pixels and is not included in the modeled reflection peak position.\nThe corrected, normalized reflection peak data set is shown in Fig. 5.16. The 440 nm data set had an additional\ncorrection applied to make the haze component similar to the other data sets. One possible explanation for the\napparent increase in scattered light is a wavelength-instability problem with the 440 nm diode laser used to acquire\nthe spectrum. This would broaden the primary image and lead to an overestimation of the reflection peak amplitude\nin the modeled slit-scatter function.\nFor the slit-scatter function model, we are interested in the fraction of the in-band radiation scattered into the\nreflection peak. The amplitude-corrected reflection peaks are fit to Gaussian line shapes, giving the reflection peak\narea as a function of excitation wavelength or peak pixel. The reflection peak area as a function of position is shown\nin Fig. 5.17. The solid line is the fit to the data using Eq. (5.16) for pixels greater than 100 and Eq. (5.17) for pixels\nless than 100; i.e.\ny = a1 (1 + ( x / a2 ) a3 ) , and\ny = b1 (1 + ((350 \xe2\x88\x92 x) / b2 ) ) .\nwhere x refers to the pixel under consideration.\nb3\n\n(5.16)\n(5.17)\n\nThe area must be further corrected for the increased rate at which the reflection peak moves through a particular\npixel compared with the primary image. The primary image moves at a rate of approximately 0.58 nm/pixel while\nthe reflection peak\xe2\x80\x99s dispersion is 0.35 nm/pixel. This will be discussed further, in subsections to follow, with\nregard to the red spectrograph.\n\n100\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nP 420\nP 421\n\nAmplitude (a.u.)\n\nP 422\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nRelative Wavelength (nm)\n\nFigure 5.11: Normalized, center-wavelength-subtracted responsivity of BSG pixels 420, 421 and 422.\n10 -2\n\nRelative Response (a.u.)\n\n10 -3\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -5\n\n10 -6\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nColumn\n\nFigure 5.12: MOS205 BSG out-of-band slit-scatter function.\n\n101\n\n600\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nExcitation Peak Position (Pixel)\n\n350.0\n\n300.0\n\n250.0\n\n200.0\n\n150.0\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\nReflection Peak Position (Pixel)\n\nFigure 5.13: Location of the MOS205 BSG primary image versus the position of the reflection peak,\nwith the solid line a fit to the data.\n\n543.5 nm\n440 nm\n458 nm\n476 nm\n488 nm\n497 nm\n502 nm\n514 nm\n532 nm\n\n0.012\n\n0.010\n\nAmplitude\n\n0.0080\n\n0.0060\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0020\n\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nRelative Position (Pixel)\n\nFigure 5.14: MOS205/MOBY219 LuMid BSG reflection peak data set, uncorrected for the amplitude\nof the excitation peak\n\n102\n\nAmplitude\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nWavelength (nm)\nFigure 5.15: Gaussian fit to the MOS205/MOBY219 BSG in-band data set.\n0.012\n\n440 nm\n458 nm\n476 nm\n488 nm\n497 nm\n502 nm\n514 nm\n532 nm\n543.5 nm\n\nAmplitude (Corrected)\n\n0.010\n\n0.0080\n\n0.0060\n\n0.0040\n\n0.0020\n\n0.0\n-100\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nRelative Position (Pixel)\n\nFigure 5.16: MOS205/MOBY219 LuMid BSG reflection peak data set, corrected for the\namplitude of the excitation peak.\n\n103\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n0.10\n\nAmplitude\n\n0.080\n\n0.060\n\n0.040\n\n0.020\n\n0.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nReflection Peak Position (Pixel)\n\nFigure 5.17: Reflection peak area as a function of position; the solid line is a fit to the data.\n\n104\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 5.18: Response of BSG pixels 400 to 511 and full RSG response for discrete laser excitation in\nthe range from 640 nm to 690 nm.\nM205/MOBY219 BSG Off-CCD Scattering\nThere is additional scattering onto the right edge of the CCD from light not directly imaged onto it. In Fig.\n5.18, we show the responsivity of pixels 400 to 511 for the BSG from discrete laser excitation in the range from 640\nnm to 690 nm. Tunable lasers in the 640 nm to 690 nm spectral range were not available during the field\nmeasurements and we do not have enough spectral data to directly model BSG stray light effects in this range.\nConsequently, the magnitude of this contribution was empirically fit to validation source data sets (discussed in\nSection 5) by including a quadratic term in the BSG slit-scatter function in the overlap region (pixels 400 to 511).\nMOS205/MOBY219 Red Spectrograph (RSG)\nThe same set of model slit-scatter parameters was determined for the MOS205/MOBY219 RSG, with the\nexception of the off CCD term. Flux transmitted through the dichroic beamsplitter, incident on the RSG, falls off\nrapidly below 600 nm. Essentially no light below 550 nm is incident on the CCD, so a term to account for off-CCD\nscattering is not included in the RSG model slit-scatter function.\nMOS205/M219RSG in-band area\nImages were acquired as the excitation wavelength was tuned in small steps over the spectral range from 740\nnm to 750 nm. The in-band areas of three adjacent pixels P756, P757, and P758, shown in Fig. 5.19, were\ndetermined. The areas agreed to within 0.25 %; changing the limits of integration from \xc2\xb1 4 nm to \xc2\xb1 6 nm changed\nthe in-band area less than 0.2 %. The in-band area and uncertainty are listed in Table 5.1.\nMOS205/M219 LuMid RSG OOB Slit-scatter Function\n\n105\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nThe peak-normalized OOB slit-scatter function, along with the double-exponential fit to the data [Eq. (5.13)]\nare shown in Fig. 5.20. Note that the reflection peak was masked for this fit as well as the in-band \xc2\xb1 5 center pixels.\nThere is a 0.6 pixel offset from center between the image and the fit. This small offset is ignored in the model.\nParameters are listed in Table 5.1.\nMOS205/M219 LuMid RSG Reflection peaks\nImages were acquired for excitation wavelengths ranging from 640 nm to 800 nm. A linear fit to the\nrelationship between the reflection peak and the excitation peak positions is shown by the solid line in Fig. 5.21.\nNext the central peaks were fit to a Gaussian lineshape, with a width determined from the in-band scan. As with the\nBSG, these data are used to properly normalize the reflection peak amplitude. For the RSG, the dispersion is 0.804\nnm/pixel. Uncorrected and corrected reflection peak data sets are shown in Figs. 5.22 and 5.23. Note that there is\nan apparent increase in the amplitude of the reflection peak for the first 3 wavelengths, where diode lasers were used\nfor excitation. As with the BSG 440 nm data set, it may be a consequence of the multi-mode spectral output of the\ndiode lasers used for this spectral region.\nThe amplitude-corrected reflection peaks are fit to Gaussian functions with a linear offset, giving the reflection\npeak area as a function of excitation peak pixel. The areas are again corrected for the rate at which the reflection\npeak moves through a particular pixel. For example, consider the RSG fine scans around 740 nm. In this spectral\nregion, a reflectance peak is observed around 700 nm (pixel 702), as shown in Fig. 5.24. As the excitation is\nscanned in small steps, the response of pixel 702 can be measured and compared with the spectral width of the\nreflection peak in Fig. 5.24. Fig. 5.25(a) shows the reflection peak observed for 740.3 nm excitation, while Fig.\n5.25(b) shows the spectral response of pixel P702. Both are plotted in wavelength scale using a dispersion of 0.804\nnm/pixel for Fig. 5.25(a). Note the reduction in the width of the P702 reflection peak with respect to the reflection\npeak image from monochromatic excitation. This apparent reduction occurs because of the difference in the spectral\ndispersion of the primary and reflection peak images, and must be taken into account in the model of the reflection\npeak amplitude.\nThe final results are graphically illustrated in Fig. 5.26 with the fit to Eq. (5.16) shown by the solid line.

The algorithm was used to correct MOBY calibration and in-water\ndata sets. MOBY was calibrated using a lamp-illuminated integrating sphere calibrated for spectral radiance. The\niterative stray-light correction procedure described in Section 5.2 [Eq. (5.7)] was applied to the measured signal.\nIterations were repeated until a stable solution was reached; a solution that changed by less than 0.1 % from the\nprevious iteration was considered stable. Typically, a stable solution was reached after 4 to 5 iterations. The\nuncorrected responsivity and the stray-light corrected responsivities are shown in Fig. 5.27. In Fig. 5.28, the ratio of\nthe corrected responsivity to the uncorrected responsivity is shown. Stray-light is responsible for approximately\n10 % of the signal over much of the spectral range, increasing rapidly below 400 nm for the BSG, and below\n640 nm for the RSG. The rectangular increase in the corrected over uncorrected ratio (reduction in stray-light) for\nthe BSG near 500 nm occurs in the region where the reflection peak coincides with the primary image.\nUsing the stray-light-corrected responsivities, MOBY up-welling radiance data are corrected using Eq. (5.9).\nUncorrected and corrected radiance measured by each arm is shown in Fig. 5.29, and the ratio of uncorrected to\ncorrected up-welling radiance in Fig. 5.30. Note the dramatic improvement in the agreement between the two\nspectrographs in their overlap region in the stray-light-corrected results. There is also a significant increase in the\nmeasured up-welling radiance below 400 nm.\nMOBY is used to vicariously calibrate SeaWiFS by providing measurements of water-leaving radiance. The\nwater-leaving radiance is determined from the up-welling radiance according to Clark (Clark et al. 2002a; Clark et\nal. 2002b). The water-leaving radiance was calculated for stray-light-corrected and uncorrected data sets. The\ncorrection factor \xe2\x80\x94 or ratio of corrected to uncorrected water-leaving radiance \xe2\x80\x94 is shown in Fig. 5.31. We again\nsee a strong increase in the corrected water-leaving radiance below 400 nm, reaching a value of approximately 40 %\nfor 360 nm radiation. The corrected water-leaving radiance is less than the uncorrected values for wavelengths\nlonger than 500 nm. The decrease rises to approximately 20 % for the BSG beyond 600 nm.\n\n110\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nBand-integrated stray-light-correction factors for water-leaving radiance for the SeaWiFS bands are listed in\nTable 5.2.

Different relative spectral\ndistributions were realized using glass and interference filters and a lamp-illuminated integrating sphere source. The\nspectral radiance for the CS configurations was determined separately using a calibrated spectroradiometer. The\nSLC algorithm was validated by comparing the corrected spectral radiances from measurements with MOBY to the\nknown CS spectral radiances.\nA lamp-illuminated integrating sphere source, model OL420 from Optronic Laboratories,10 was used for the CS.\nBriefly, it is a 20.32 cm diameter, externally illuminated sphere that is coated with barium sulfate. The exit aperture\nis 5.72 cm in diameter and the entrance aperture is orientated 90\xc2\xb0 with respect to the exit aperture. Quartz windows\non both apertures protect the sphere from contamination. A monitor detector, fitted with a photopic filter, is\nmounted in the wall of the sphere and its output voltage is recorded during operation.\n\n0.9\n\n0.009\n\n0.8\n\n0.008\n\n2\n\nL(\xce\xbb) [\xc2\xb5W/(cm sr nm)]\n\n0.7\n0.6\n\n0.007\n\nOL420\n\n0.006\n\nI400\n\n0.5\n\n0.005\nI750\n\nI700\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.004\n0.003\n\nPER\n\n0.2\n\n0.002\nBG39\n\n0.1\n\n0.001\n\nBG28\n\n0.0\n350\n\n0.000\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\n700\n\n750\n\n800\n\n850\n\nWavelength [nm]\n\nFigure 5.32: Spectral radiance of the OL420 Colored Source with different filters. The\nradiance of the CS with the I400 nm interference filter, which is a very low level, is shown on\nthe right-hand axis. VXR measurements of the CS are given by the open symbols.\nFor the CS, we utilized the filter slide that is located between the lamp and the entrance aperture. Six CS\nconfigurations were possible, with each filter in a corresponding filter slide for ease of use and minimization of\ncontamination through handling. Three colored glass filters were used: Schott BG28 and BG3911, and CVI12 PER\nfilter, producing blue, turquoise and photopic (green) spectral distributions. Three interference filters were used,\ncentered at 400 nm, 700 nm, and 750 nm, with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidths of 10 nm, 45 nm and\n10 nm, respectively.\n\n10\n\nCertain commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this paper to foster understanding.

The spectral radiances for the PER, BG28, and BG39\nconfigurations of the CS were determined at NIST in May 2001 using a reference spectroradiometer. The\ninstrument is a double-grating, scanning monochromator (Brown and Ohno 1999). It has been fully characterized,\nwith a stray-light factor of less than 10-6. For the CS calibration, the bandpass was set to 5 nm FWHM and a\nwavelength step of 5 nm was used. For determinations of the CS spectral radiances, the unfiltered OL420 was used\nto calibrate the scanning monochromator. Typical spectral radiances for the six configurations are shown in\nFig. 5.32. The reference spectroradiometer is not a field instrument, and was not transported to the MOBY field\nsite.\nDuring the field deployments, the EOS/NIST Visible Transfer Radiometer (VXR) was used to verify the CS\nspectral radiances. The VXR is a six-channel filter radiometer (Butler et al. 1999), and comparison to the reference\nspectroradiometer results could only be done where the VXR filter channels coincided with measurable output for\nthe CS configurations. The agreement with the PER was -0.8 % at 548 nm and +1.9 % at 661 nm; with the BG28, it\nwas -3 % at 441 nm and -0.7 % at 548 nm, where negative values indicate the VXR values were lower than the\nreference spectroradiometer. The VXR results are shown as symbols in Fig. 5.32.\nThe CS was measured by the radiance ports on the upper or middle buoy arms. The results for the source\nBG28, PER, and I750 filters are shown in Fig. 5.33. The spectral radiances derived using MOBY are shown with\nand without correction for stray light along with the spectral radiances for the CS configurations determined using\nthe reference spectroradiometer. Within the in-band spectral regions, the corrected MOBY values agree with the CS\nspectral radiances to within 5 %.\nThe out-of-band regions are an important test of the stray-light-correction algorithm. The BG28 configuration\ndecreases by an order of magnitude in the crossover region between the BSG and the RSG, similar to the behavior\nseen in MOBY waters [see Fig. 5.33(a)]. For this configuration, the correction algorithm was sensitive to the\nparameters for the off-CCD scattering, resulting in under- or over-correction in the overlap region. We determined\nthe off-CCD parameters by minimizing the differences between the two spectrographs for the BG28 configuration.\nFigure 5.33(a) shows that MOBY overestimates the spectral radiance as the wavelength decreases if not\ncorrected for effects arising from stray light. The PER configuration, shown in Fig. 5.33(b), is an excellent test of\nthe ability of the SLC algorithm for the shorter measurement wavelengths in the BSG. The spectral radiance in the\nregion below 450 nm for the PER configuration decreases by more than 10-6 compared to the maximum value.\nUncorrected, the MOBY values are discrepant by more than three decades in this spectral region. With correction\nfor stray light, the agreement is improved substantially.\nThe inability to correct at the shortest wavelengths, below 400 nm, is understood in terms of the low system\nresponsivity in this spectral region.\nA test of the algorithm for the RSG is shown in Fig. 5.33(c) using the I750 interference filter (peak\ntransmittance at 750 nm). In the out-of-band region, the uncorrected MOBY values are discrepant by a factor of 10\nto 100, but the corrected values are in good agreement.\n\n5.6 UNCERTAINTIES\nA Monte Carlo approach was used to estimate the uncertainties in the stray-light-correction factors for MOBY\nup-welling and water-leaving radiance measurements. Model slit-scatter function parameters were input into the\nstray-light correction algorithm using mean values given in Table 5.1 and a random normal distribution with\nuncertainties given in Table 5.3. Uncertainties are approximately a factor of 2 larger than those given in Table 5.1 to\naccount for possible additional uncertainties in the model parameters arising from changing environmental\nconditions and other unknown factors. The full stray-light correction algorithm - correcting both the responsivity\nand the in-water data - was run 100 times for a typical in-water spectrum and mean correction factors and\nuncertainties calculated. Typical results for the BSG are shown in Fig. 5.34 for MOS205/MOBY219 LuTop. Both\nthe correction factor and the associated relative uncertainty is less than 1 % over the spectral range from 420 nm to\n590 nm and both increase rapidly below 400 nm and above 600 nm, rising to approximately 8 % at the ends of the\narray: 360 nm and 640 nm, respectively.\n\n117\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nSimilarly, the uncertainty in the stray-light-correction factor for derived water-leaving radiance was determined,\nas shown in Fig. 5.35. The uncertainty in Lw is larger than the uncertainty in Lu, with a 14 % uncertainty in the\nstray-light-correction factor at 360 nm. In Table 5.4, the relative uncertainties in the band-averaged mean straylight-correction factors are given for SeaWiFS bands.\nTable 5.3: Uncertainties in slit-scatter function\nmodel parameters used in Monte Carlo simulations\nof MOS205 measurements.\n\nTable 5.4: Relative combined standard uncertainties\nin the band-averaged Lw stray-light-correction factor\nfor SeaWiFS bands.\nSeaWiFS\n\nParameter\n\nBand\n\nBSG\n\nRatio Corrected/Uncorrected LW\n\nUncertainty [%]\n\nUncertainty\n\nRSG\n\n[%]\n\nUncertainty [%]\n\n1\n\nNormalization\n\n1.085\n\n2\n2\n\n0.83\n\nOOB SSF\n\n2\n1.033\n0.36\nm1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n1.012\n\n3\n\n0.15\nm2\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n0.976\n0.21\nm3\n\n25\n\n5\n\n25\n\n0.979\n0.58\n\nReflection Peak Amplitude P<100\n\n6\n1.014\nNOP\n\na1\n5\n5\n\n118\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\na2\n5\n5\na3\n5\n5\nAmplitude (P>100)\n\na2\n5\n5\na3\n5\n5\nOff CCD Amplitude\n10\nNOP\n\n5.7 DISCUSSION\nThe SeaWiFS band-averaged water-leaving radiance stray-light-correction factors measured by MOBY during a\ntwo-month deployment (M220) is shown in Fig. 5.36. In Figs. 5.37 and 5.38, the corrected/uncorrected SeaWiFS\nband-averaged ratios are shown for 4 years of deployments. Each grouping in the figure is a separate deployment.\nThe correction factors have been stable over the entire deployment sequence, implying that the MOBY imaging and\nthe MOS slit-scatter functions, along with the ocean-color, have remained stable over this time frame. The only\nexception was for the first three deployments of the MOS204 sensor (even buoys, Fig. 5.38), when the Band 1\ncorrection factor was 2 % higher than for the other deployments. For these three deployments, low hydroxyl (OH)\noptical fiber was used to couple the radiance heads to the instrument bay. This fiber transmitted less light than the\nother fibers in the blue spectral region, in particular below 400 nm. For these three deployments, then, the relative\nstray-light contribution to the total signal in the blue spectral region was larger than for subsequent buoys, resulting\nin the larger Band 1 stray-light-correction factor for these buoys. The observed radiometric stability of the MOBY\nsystems enables us to correct previous deployments for stray light with confidence.\n\n119\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\nFigure 5.34: Uncertainty in Lu stray-light correction amplitude from Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n5.35: Uncertainty in Lw stray-light correction amplitude from Monte Carlo simulation.

Any changes\nin MOBY-derived water-leaving radiances are directly reflected in SeaWiFS calibration coefficients for these\nchannels. The effect of the MOBY stray-light correction is to increase the water-leaving radiance of SeaWiFS\nBands 1 through 4, and decrease the radiance of Bands 5 and 6. SeaWiFS uses the Band 2 (443 nm) to Band 5 (555\nnm) ratio to radiometrically determine chlorophyll a concentrations in oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll\nconcentrations about 0.3 \xc2\xb5g/l); the Band 3 (490 nm) to Band 5 ratio for mesotrophic waters (chlorophyll\nconcentrations ranging from 0.3 \xc2\xb5g/l to 1.5 \xc2\xb5g/l); and the Band 4 (510 nm) to Band 5 ratio for eutrophic waters\n(chlorophyll concentrations > 1.5 \xc2\xb5g/l) (O\'Reilly et al. 1998). Correcting for stray light increases the band ratio in\noligotrophic waters by 5 % to 6 % and approximately 3.5 % for waters with higher chlorophyll a concentrations.\nThe change in band ratios corresponds to a 25 % to 35 % decrease in chlorophyll in oligotrophic waters and a 15 %\ndecrease in mesotrophic and eutrophic waters. The stray-light correction of MOBY reduces global mean\nchlorophyll a concentrations measured by SeaWiFS by 15 % to 20 %. When combined with additional procedural\nchanges implemented in the 4th reprocessing of the SeaWiFS data set in July 2002 (SeaWiFS 2002), the result was a\nmean monthly decrease in global chlorophyll a concentration of 6 %. In addition, the stray-light correction greatly\nreduced the magnitude of an issue with SeaWiFS measuring negative water-leaving radiance in coastal regions with\ncomplex aerosol distributions.\n\nFigure 5.38: Band-averaged Lw stray-light-correction factors for SeaWiFS bands measured by even\nMOBY buoys from 1998 through 2002.\nImplications for algorithm development\nThe derivation of remote-sensing-based ocean color data products such as chlorophyll a involve the integration\nof measurements by (1) the satellite sensor (e.g. SeaWiFS), (2) the vicarious calibration sensors (e.g. MOBY), and\n(3) the instruments used to develop the bio-optical algorithms relating the physical properties of the ocean (e.g.\nchlorophyll a concentration) to a radiometric measurement. Errors in measurements of any one of the three\n\n122\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\ncomponents of the measurement chain will significantly impact the validity of the final data product. Instruments\ninvolved in ocean color measurements are typically calibrated against incandescent sources such as lampilluminated integrating spheres or reflectance plaques. These types of calibration sources have very different\nspectral distributions than the distribution of up-welling or water-leaving radiance and effects of stray light on the\ninstrument response need to be considered for these instruments.\nWhile considerable time and effort can be (and has been) expended to fully characterize and correct a satellite\nsensor or primary vicarious calibration station for stray light, it is much more difficult to extend the detailed\ncharacterization to the myriad instruments used by different groups to develop bio-optical algorithms. No general\nprotocol has been developed to characterize and correct instrumentation used to develop bio-optical algorithms for\nstray light. However, effects of stray light are effectively canceled when the calibration source distribution\napproximates a measured ocean color spectrum. We have developed a radiometrically stable, spectrally tunable,\nsolid-state calibration source for ocean color. This unique source approximates the spectral distributions of waters\nwith varying chlorophyll concentrations, and may be used to calibrate, characterize, and to correct instruments\xe2\x80\x99\nresponsivities for stray light.\nWe have developed the prototype tunable solid-state source using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). (Brown et al.\n2002). The source has 40 different, independently controlled LED channels comprised of 3 to 6 LEDs (depending\non their output power) organized into 4 heads that mount onto 5 cm ports in the wall of an integrating sphere. The\nflux from each channel can be independently changed to model the spectral distribution of water-leaving radiance in\ndifferent chlorophyll concentration waters. The output is monitored using a reference spectroradiometer integrated\ninto the system. The source is under computer control and is designed to be automatically adjusted to match any\ndesired input target spectrum, within the bandwidth limitations of the individual LEDs (~ 20 nm), to within\napproximately 5 % over the range from 390 nm to 550 nm.\nThe source has been tuned to match the water-leaving radiance from blue (oligotrophic), blue-green\n(mesotrophic), and green (eutrophic) waters, covering a wide range of chlorophyll concentrations. The target\nspectral distributions and the solid-state source output are shown in Figure 5.39. There is reasonable agreement over\nmost of the spectral range. The sphere radiance is low below 390 nm. This is partially due to the low reflectance of\nthe integrating sphere coating. With a new coating, we expect an order of magnitude increase in the radiance below\n400 nm. The source is currently missing diodes at 360 nm, 435 nm, and 455 nm. The radiance around 550 nm is\nlow due to weak diode emission; a problem that is easily addressed with the addition of extra 550 nm LEDs. The\nsource stability and its applicability to the development of stray-light correction algorithms are currently under\ninvestigation.\nWe propose to correct instruments for stray-light errors in water-leaving radiance measurements using a\nvariation on the basic approach developed for SeaWiFS by Wang, et al. (2001). Knowing the total spectral\nresponsivity of the SeaWiFS bands, a stray light, or spectral out-of-band correction, is currently applied to each\nchannel based on a semi-analytical water-leaving radiance model developed by Gordon for water with varying\nchlorophyll a concentrations (Gordon 1995; Wang et al. 2001). In this case, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the total spectral\nresponsivity of the instruments. Instead, we used the solid-state source to mimic the varying spectral water-leaving\nradiance spectral distributions and derive correction factors based on the ratio between the known radiance of the\nsource (as measured by our reference spectroradiometer) and the radiance measured by the ocean color instruments.\n\n5.8 SUMMARY\nA simple iterative procedure was developed to correct MOBY measurements for stray light. Several fully\noperational MOBY systems were characterized in situ using a tunable laser-based, fiber-coupled integrating sphere\nsource that was developed and installed at the MOBY field site at University of Hawaii Marine Center, Honolulu,\nHawaii for this purpose. MOBY buoys with MOS204 and MOS205 detector systems were characterized and model\nslit-scatter functions developed. MOBY measurements of a Colored Source validated the stray-light-corrected\nmeasurements. In-water MOBY measurements of Lu and Lw were corrected for stray light, and the effect on\nSeaWiFS bands and derived chlorophyll-a concentrations were evaluated.\n\n123\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n35\n\nTarget Spectrum\n\nRadiance (W.cm-3.sr-1)\n\n30\n\nLED source spectrum\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\nRadiance (W.cm-3.sr-1)\n\n25\n\nLED S ource S pectrum\nTarget spectrum\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n6\nRadiance (W.cm-3.sr-1)\n\nLED S ource spectrum\n\n5\n\nS pectrum to match\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\nFigure 5.39: Target and LED source spectra for (a) blue, (b) blue-green and (c) green\nwaters.\n\n124\n\nOcean Optics Protocols For Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation, Revision 4, Volume VI\n\n5.9 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support for this work from the U.S. Air Force Metrology and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nSeaWiFS, SIMBIOS, MODIS and EOS Calibration/Validation program offices.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarnes, R.

Fargion\nScience Applications International Corporation, Beltsville, Maryland.\nThis appendix summarizes the essential operational characteristics of ocean color sensors of the past, present\nand future. Table A.1 lists general characteristics of past and presently operating ocean color sensors, including for\neach the satellite platform, country and agency, operational time period (actual or planned), orbit characteristics,\nspatial resolution at nadir, swath width, and tilt capabilities. Table A.2 lists the same information for ocean color\nsensors currently planned for launch and operation in the future. Table A.3 lists the center wavelength, spectral\nbandwidth (FWHM) and noise equivalent radiance resolution (NE\xe2\x88\x86L) for the ocean color bands of each of the\nsensors listed in Tables A.1 and A.2. Many of these sensors have additional bands, not listed here, addressing data\nrequirements in terrestrial or atmospheric sciences. The information in these tables was updated from that published\nin IOCCG (1998). The sensor band data in Table A.3 should be used to expand Table 4.1 when specifying in situ\ninstrument characteristics needed to support algorithm development and validation related to any of the other\nsensors, in addition to SeaWiFS, which fall within the SIMBIOS purview.\nREFERENCES\nIOCCG 1998: Minimum Requirements for an Operational, Ocean Colour Sensor for the Open Ocean.
