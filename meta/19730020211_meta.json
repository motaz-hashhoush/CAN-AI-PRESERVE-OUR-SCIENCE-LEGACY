The Korea Institute of Science and Technology and the IIT Research Institute were selected as the active transfer agents to participate in the program. The pilot project was based upon the approach to the transfer of domestic technology developed by the NASA Technology Utilization Division and utilized the extensive data and technical resources available through the Space Agency and its contractors. This pilot project has helped to clarify some aspects of the international technology transfer process and to upgrade Korean technological capabilities.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730020211, "id": "a0e9683cb27d423ba123efe5c38e706a", "publicationDate": "1973-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730020211.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730020211/downloads/19730020211.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730020211/downloads/19730020211.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730020211/downloads/19730020211.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
