The AMU analyzed 7 stability parameters that showed the possibility of providing guidance in forecasting severe weather, calculated verification statistics for the Total Threat Score (TTS), and calculated warm season verification statistics for the 2010 season. The AMU also performed statistical logistic regression analysis on the 22-year severe weather database. The results indicated that the logistic regression equation did not show an increase in skill over the previously developed TTS. The equation showed less accuracy than TTS at predicting severe weather, little ability to distinguish between severe and non-severe weather days, and worse standard categorical accuracy measures and skill scores over TTS.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014504, "id": "d3a7bb9108244fc58d6dbbac98e767c5", "publicationDate": "2011-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014504.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014504/downloads/20110014504.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014504/downloads/20110014504.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014504/downloads/20110014504.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
