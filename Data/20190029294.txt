b'Helical Engine\nDavid M. Burns, Ph.D.1\nNASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama, 35812, USA\nA new concept for in-space propulsion is proposed in which propellant is not ejected from\nthe engine, but instead is captured to create a nearly infinite specific impulse. The engine\naccelerates ions confined in a closed loop to relativistic speeds, and slightly varies their velocity\nto change their momentum. The engine then moves the ions back and forth along the direction\nof travel to produce thrust. This in-space engine is intended to be used for long-term satellite\nstation-keeping without refueling or to propel spacecraft across interstellar distances. The\nengine has no moving parts other than ions traveling in a closed-loop vacuum line, trapped\ninside electric and magnetic fields.\n\nI.

Introduction\nChemical, nuclear, and electric propulsion systems produce thrust by accelerating and expelling propellants. Deep\nspace travel is often a trade-off between thrust and large propellant storage tanks that eventually limit performance.\nThe objective of this paper is to introduce and examine a unique engine that uses a closed-cycle propellant. This in1\n\nManager, Office of Science and Technology.\n\n1\n\nspace engine is intended to provide long-term station-keeping for satellites without refueling and for traveling\ninterstellar distances at high speed. As opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cpropellantless drives\xe2\x80\x9d such as the EM Drive [1], the proposed\nHelical Engine relies on well understood physical processes. The key challenge is to determine if the engine can\nprovide meaningful thrust within real world engineering constraints.\nAs a thought experiment, imagine a\n(d)\nbox resting on a frictionless surface in a\nLeft\nRight\nvacuum as shown in Fig 1. The box\ncontains a heavy ring that slides easily on\na rod and can be given an initial push to\none side using a mechanical spring. Also\n(a)\nassume that when the ring reaches an end (c)\nof the box, the resulting collision is elastic.\nIf the ring is pushed towards the right as\nshown in Fig 1(a), then box will move left\nas described by Newton\xe2\x80\x99s Third Law of\n(b)\nMotion. The box will stop when the ring\nreaches the right side in Fig 1(b). If the\nring has an elastic collision with the right\nside of the box, the ring will then move\ntowards the left and the box towards the\nFig. 1 Thought Experiment.\nright as shown in Fig 1(c). Now imagine\nthat as the ring travels through the middle of the box in Fig 1(c), the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass is halved. When the modified ring\nreaches the left side as shown in Fig 1(d), the resulting momentum exchange is half the amount exchanged in Fig 1(b),\nso the box will continue to slide right at half its peak velocity. The system essentially ejected half of the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass\nas \xe2\x80\x9cpropellant.\xe2\x80\x9d If the ring is returned to its original mass while it is moving through the position shown in Fig 1(a),\nthen the cycle can be repeated.\nEach cycle increases the system\xe2\x80\x99s velocity, assuming the process used to reduce or increase the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass does\nnot impart a significant momentum change to the box. Even if the box is traveling at 1,000 km/s and the ring has a\ntop speed of 10 m/s inside the box, the system will accelerate because all components are moving at an initial velocity\nof 1,000 km/s from the perspective of an external observer. Conservation of Momentum applies during the collisions\nwith each end of the box because the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass is constant and there are no external forces acting during these\nintervals (Fig 1(b) and Fig 1(d)). The ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass changes as it travels through the middle of the box (Fig 1(a) and\nFig 1(c)), though this does not impact the box\xe2\x80\x99s velocity since the ring is traveling at a constant velocity during these\nphases. The velocity change (\xe2\x88\x86v) to the box produced in this experiment over one cycle that starts and ends in Fig\n1(a) can be represented by Equation 1, where vz is the starting velocity of the ring with respect to the inside of the box,\nmBox is the mass of the box, m1 and m2 are the mass of the ring when it hits the right and left sides of the box\nrespectively.\n\n\xe2\x88\x86\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3\n\n=\n\n(\n(\n\n)\n\n)(\n\n(1)\n\n)\n\nNote that if the mass of the ring does not change (m1 = m2), then the net velocity change for the box is zero and\nmomentum is conserved in the box-ring system. The box\xe2\x80\x99s acceleration, a, is equal to the velocity change in Equation\n1 divided by the time required for the ring to complete a circuit and is shown in Equation 2, where LBox and LRing are\nthe internal widths of the box and ring, respectively.\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x8e\n\n=\n\n(\n(\n\n)(\n\n)\n)(\n\n)\n\n(2)\n\nThe box\xe2\x80\x99s acceleration can be improved by increasing the ring\xe2\x80\x99s velocity inside the box, as well as increasing the\namount of the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass that is changed. Equations 1 and 2 are not valid when vz approaches relativistic speeds\nbecause relationships for momentum, force, and kinetic energy become more complex.\nThe ring\xe2\x80\x99s momentum is not constant during every point inside the local box-ring system in this thought\nexperiment. Momentum is defined as the product of mass and velocity, and the ring\xe2\x80\x99s mass is not constant. The ring\nrequires an external action or force to change its mass, so the thought experiment does not have enough information\nto evaluate conservation of momentum. If the box and ring continue to accelerate from perspective of an external\nobserver, then the local system\xe2\x80\x99s total momentum will increase. Momentum may be conserved in the global sense of\nthe box-ring system and the surrounding environment. Adding or subtracting mass distorts the surrounding space-\n\n2\n\ntime environment and requires an external intervention to the local box-ring system. These influences may create a\nbalancing force on the surrounding environment to the acceleration produced by the box and ring, which will conserve\nmomentum at the global level. A method for changing the ring\xe2\x80\x99s momentum using external power is presented in the\nnext section, and global conservation of momentum will be revisited in section IV.\n\nIII. Implementing Relativistic Momentum Change Using a Particle Accelerator\nThe proposed engine replaces the solid ring in\nFig 1 with a ring of ions rotating in a plane\nBottom\nTop\northogonal to the engine\xe2\x80\x99s thrust vector as depicted\nX\nin Fig 2. The engine varies the rotational velocity of\nthe ions to change their momentum as the ring is\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xa3Z\nmoved back and forth inside the engine. To prevent\nY\nZ\nion velocity changes from negatively impacting the\nengine\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, the radius of rotation for the\nions in the ring increases as the ions accelerate and\nFig. 2 Diagram of Proposed Engine Operation.\ndecreases when the ions decelerate. The total\nnumber of ions in the engine does not change. The\nion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity component is denoted by vz and is relative to the inside of the engine.\nRelationships for momentum, force and kinetic energy are presented in Table 1. Relativistic formulas can be\napproximated by the classical formulas when an object\xe2\x80\x99s velocity is much less than the speed of light [2,3]. \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe is the\nLorentz factor, an element of Special Relativity [2]. The momentum of each ion (along with other properties, such as\nlength and time) depends on its absolute velocity. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s momentum increases faster as a function of its absolute\nvelocity using the relativistic instead of the classical formula because \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe \xe2\x89\xa5 1.\nTable 1 Classical and Relativistic Dynamics.\n\nClassical\nMomentum\n\nForce\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9d\x86 = \xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x97\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x85\xf0\x9d\x9d\x86\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad=\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x85\xf0\x9d\x92\x95\n\nRelativistic\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9d\x86 = \xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8\xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x97\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x85\xf0\x9d\x9d\x86\xe2\x88\x97\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad=\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x85\xf0\x9d\x92\x95\n\nusing\n\nDefinitions\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8=\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9f\x8f\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x97\xf0\x9d\x9f\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x9f\x8f\xe2\x88\x92 \xf0\x9d\x9f\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x84\n\n* Must account for\ndirection of travel\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x82\n\nAcceleration\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad\n\nForce\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xb2\xf0\x9d\x91\xac Kinetic Energy\n\nKinetic Energy\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad = \xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x82\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xb2\xf0\x9d\x91\xac =\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9f\x8f\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x97 \xf0\x9d\x9f\x90\n\xf0\x9d\x9f\x90\n\nPerpendicular\n\nMomentum\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\n\nResting Mass\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x84\n\nSpeed of Light\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x95\n\nTime\n\n\xf0\x9d\x92\x97\n\nVelocity\n\nParallel\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad = \xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8\xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x82\n\nForce\n\nLorentz Factor\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9d\x86\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xad = \xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8 \xf0\x9d\x9f\x91 \xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x82\n\n\xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\xb2\xf0\x9d\x91\xac = \xf0\x9d\x92\x8e\xf0\x9d\x92\x84 \xf0\x9d\x9f\x90 \xf0\x9d\x9c\xb8 \xe2\x88\x92 \xf0\x9d\x9f\x8f\n\nEach ion transfers the z-axis component of its momentum to the top (right side of Fig 2) and then the bottom (left\nside of Fig 2) of the engine. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity changes at each end are modeled as elastic collisions with the\nsystem. Thrust is created because the two momentum transfers are not balanced. The proposed engine attempts to\ncreate the momentum difference in these collisions by first accelerating and then decelerating the ions.\nForce produced by an ion traveling at a relativistic velocity depends on the ion\xe2\x80\x99s direction of travel. Newton\xe2\x80\x99s\nSecond Law of Motion can be applied to define force as a change in momentum divided by the amount of time required\nfor that change to occur. The asterisk on the relativistic formula for this method implies there are parallel and\nperpendicular momentum components that adjust the application of the Lorentz factor accordingly. More force is\nrequired to accelerate an object parallel to its direction of travel (proportional to \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe 3) than in a direction perpendicular\n\n3\n\nto its direction of travel (proportional to \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe). This will be a key relationship that will determine the efficiency of the\nproposed engine. Relativistic kinetic energy also increases faster than the classical definition as an object\xe2\x80\x99s velocity\napproaches the speed of light.\nIf an ion rotating in a circle is moved along an axis perpendicular to its plane of rotation, the resulting motion is a\nhelix. Instead of mechanically guiding a fixed ion ring back and forth, a single closed-loop helically shaped beam\nguide can be used to transport the ions along the optimum path inside the engine. The beam guide is a coiled circular\nparticle accelerator that uses electric and magnetic fields to accelerate and guide ions inside a closed and sealed tubular\nvacuum line.\nA. Implementation Using a Helical Beam Guide\nThe beam guide is designed to hold the ion\xe2\x80\x99s\nz-axis component constant while its absolute\nvelocity is increased or decreased as needed. Fig\n3 demonstrates how an ion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity\ncomponent can be held constant while its absolute\nvelocity increases. The radius of curvature\nincreases in proportion to its absolute velocity, so\nthe ion has a longer distance to travel in the x-y\nplane as it moves upwards along the +z-axis. The\nengine changes the momentum of ions by\nincreasing and decreasing their rotational velocity\naround the z-axis, which is parallel to the engine\xe2\x80\x99s\ndirection of travel. This allows the ion\xe2\x80\x99s absolute\nvelocity to be altered without imparting force\nalong the engine\xe2\x80\x99s direction of travel.\nThe Helical Engine has two concentric helical\nbeam guide \xe2\x80\x9ccores.\xe2\x80\x9d Ions travel toward the top of\nthe engine in an outer core with a constant positive\nz-axis velocity and increasing absolute velocity.\nFig. 3 Increasing Ion Absolute Speed with a Constant\nThis corresponds to the action in Fig 1(a) and is\nZ-axis Velocity Component.\naccomplished by accelerating ions using strong\nelectric fields and increasing the radius of\nrotation. Ions return to the bottom of the engine in an inner core, corresponding to the action in Fig 1(c), with a\nconstant negative z-axis velocity and decreasing absolute velocity. This is accomplished by decelerating the ion\xe2\x80\x99s\nrotational velocity using an undulator [4] or similar device to lower the ion\xe2\x80\x99s kinetic energy and decrease the radius\nof rotation. The direction of rotation is the same for both cores. Even if the engine is traveling at a relativistic speed,\nthe system will accelerate because ions are changing momentum according to their own reference frame inside the\nengine under the General Theory of Relativity.\nB. Proposed Helical Engine\nAn example design is presented in Fig 4(a), where lines represent the path of a single closed-loop beam guide.\nThe green line in the center section of each core identifies the accelerator (outer core) or decelerator (inner core). The\nradius of rotation changes as needed in the accelerator and decelerator sections to keep the z-axis velocity component\nconstant. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s velocity on the z-axis is reversed in the blue lines at each end so ions can exchange momentum\nwith the engine and the inner and outer cores can connect. Ion absolute velocity (also referred to as the total magnitude\nof the velocity) is constant in the blue sections of the beam guide.\nThe beam guide\xe2\x80\x99s helical path mimics the path an ion rotating in a ring follows, if the ring is rapidly moved from\nend to end. Ions travel towards the top of the engine in the outer core in Fig 4(b), which has a radius of curvature that\nincreases in the accelerator region (green line). The beam guide radius of curvature then decreases so it can connect\nwith the inner core. Ions return to the bottom of the engine in Fig 4(c), which has a radius of curvature that decreases\nin the decelerator region (green line). Ions travel in \xe2\x80\x9cbunches\xe2\x80\x9d in synchrotrons instead of being equally distributed\nthroughout the volume. It could be possible to set the radius of curvature to the same range for the inner and outer\ncores, and manipulate the travel time of bunches to avoid collisions.\n\n4\n\nFig. 4 Side and Top Down Views of a Helical Engine Beam Guide.

Relativistic Momentum Transfer Model (RMTM)\nThe author created a relativistic physics-based model for examining arbitrarily shaped closed-path beam guide\nstructures. The Relativistic Momentum Transfer Model simulates force, mass, energy, and velocity. The model also\npredicts magnetic, electric, and radiation fields and emissions. A specific implementation of the design architecture\ndepicted in Fig 4 was created and analyzed using RMTM and is presented in Table 2. The z-axis roll-out angle is the\ninitial angle of the beam guide in the accelerator region with respect to the x-y plane.\nTable 2 RMTM Simulation of An Example Design.\nBeam Guide\nBeam Diameter\nIon Type\n\n5 mm\nAlpha (He++)\n-11\n\nIon Pressure\n\n10\n\nTotal Round Trip Length\n\n576.9 m\n\nTotal Volume\nOuter Core Radius\n\natm\n\n11,328 cm\n\nMinimum\n\n3\n\nInner Core Radius\nMinimum\nMaximum\n\n6.25 m\n6.278 m\n\nZ-axis Roll-Out Angle\nSamples in Simulation\n\n70\n2,451,600\n\n7.0888\n\nAccelerator\n\n99.05 %c\n\n\xcf\x92 Calculated using Table 1\n\n6.527 m\n\no\n\n\xcf\x92 Calculated using Table 1\nMaximum Velocity\n\n6.5 m\n\nMaximum\n\nSimulation Output\n99.0 %c\nThrust (z-axis)\n\nMinimum Velocity\n\nTop Bend\n\n-8\n\n-2.103 x 10 N\n+42.37 N\n-8\n\n7.2648\n\nDecelerator\n\n-2.345 x 10 N\n\nAverage Velocity\nIon Cycle Time\n\n99.024 %c\n1,943 ns\n\nBottom Bend\nTotal Thrust\n\n-41.34 N\n1.03 N\n\nTotal Number of Ions in Beam Guide\n\n3.029 x 10\n\nIon Lifetime\n\n12\n\n10 hours\n\nIon Mass Expended Each Year\nMaximum Magnetic Field\nAverage Magnetic Field\nAverage X-Ray Emissions\n\n-11\n\n1.776 x 10 kg\n7.18 T\n6.97 T\n-11\n\n5.02 x 10\n\n0.231 lbf\nTotal Torque\n\nW\n\nPower\nAccelerator Power\nDecelerator Power*\n\n-5\n\n1.226 x 10 N\xc2\xb7m\n165 MW\n-165 MW\n\n* Decelerator generates power\nRMTM Version: 2.41\n\nThe design presented in Table 2 was predicted to produce approximately 1 N of continuous thrust by the RMTM\nsimulator. The relativistic momentum of each ion is higher at the top of the engine than the bottom. The small z-axis\nthrust losses for the accelerator and decelerator regions are due in part to the use of a low pass filter during construction,\n\n5\n\nwhich was applied to smooth the beam guide structure and avoid discontinuities. Fig 5 was produced by RMTM and\nshows the system level force and velocity changes resulting from all ions traveling through a complete circuit of the\nbeam guide. Fig 5(a) shows the z-axis force and Fig 5(b) shows the resulting system velocity change, assuming an\narbitrary system mass of 10,000 kg. The time scale used on the bottom axes of Fig 5 indicates the position of ions in\nthe engine. Ions start at the bottom of the engine (time equals zero) and travel through the outer core. Ions transition\nto the inner core at 971.5 ns. Ions complete a round trip when they return to their original starting position at 1,943\nns. This scale is also used in Fig 6. The vertical axes show the force or velocity change for each segment in the\nsimulation.\n\nFig. 5 Effect of all Ions Completing a Single Cycle in the Beam Guide.\nEach ion starts at the bottom of the engine and then travels up towards the accelerator region in the outer core,\nimparting a negative force to the system. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity is almost constant inside the accelerator, so only a\nvery small force is transferred to the system. The ion then moves towards the top of the engine and applies a positive\nforce to the system as its z-axis velocity is reversed. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity is almost constant inside the decelerator,\nso only a very small force is transferred to the system. The ion then returns to the bottom after exiting the decelerator,\nwhich applies a negative force. The velocity change for an ion traveling through a single cycle is small, however the\nbeam guide contains over 3\xc3\x971012 ions that complete over a half million round trip cycles each second.\nEach ion applies a force aligned with the z-axis when the z-axis component of its velocity changes. The z-axis\nvelocity component of each ion as it completes a round trip is shown in Fig 6, starting from the bottom of the engine.\nThe ion\xe2\x80\x99s z-axis velocity is negative when it is moving in the inner core back towards the bottom of the engine because\nit is then traveling in the negative z-axis direction. The ion\xe2\x80\x99s absolute velocity in Fig 6 includes all three axis velocity\ncomponents. As the ion\xe2\x80\x99s absolute velocity increases, its relativistic momentum increases non-linearly at a faster rate\nthan the classical formula as predicted by the momentum equations in Table 1.\nRegrettably, the accelerator section of the design defined in Table 2 requires 165 MW of power for continuous\noperation. This power can also be approximated using the change in ion relativistic kinetic energy and the amount of\ntime required to make this change. The actual \xe2\x80\x9cwall plug\xe2\x80\x9d power will depend on many other factors. Fortunately,\npower produced in the inner core\xe2\x80\x99s decelerator is nearly equal to this amount. If all the power collected in the\ndecelerator could be applied to the accelerator, the design described in Table 2 would require less than 10 watts to\noffset momentum and radiation losses for all ions during operation. Additional power would be required to generate\ncontrol electric and magnetic fields inside the beam guide. Harvesting power in the decelerator is not only important\nfor improving engine efficiency \xe2\x80\x93 it also reduces the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the engine during\noperation.\nThe engine scales linearly with power. 100x the power and 100x the ion density, yields 100x the thrust without\nincreasing the peak magnetic field. Thrust is scaled by adjusting the ion density (number of ions inside the engine)\nand power, or ion mass and power \xe2\x80\x93 not the velocity of the ions inside the system. The ion velocity range is set when\nthe engine is designed because this range determines the radius of curvature in the beam guide. Replacing ionized\nHelium with Xenon for example would increase ion mass and increase the available engine thrust.\n\n6\n\nFig. 6 Z-axis and Absolute Ion Velocity (Magnitude) During A Round Trip.\nThe efficient transfer of energy from the inner to outer core is important if this engine is to become feasible. An\ninitial concept for harvesting energy in the decelerator is to use magnetic undulators tuned to produce RF fields that\ndirectly accelerate ions in the accelerator. This approach transfers energy efficiently, avoiding parasitic losses typical\nwith electrical conversion processes. The helical design brings the accelerator and decelerator beam guide sections\ninto proximity, reducing energy transfer path lengths. Additional loops can be added to increase thrust or aid in\nthermal dissipation. Ions travel in bunches and their position can be accurately controlled. The author proposes to\nuse this precision to position decelerating ions to reinforce accelerating ions in an adjacent section of the beam guide.\nIons in a synchrotron may have lifetimes of 10 hours or more \xe2\x80\x93 implying the design presented in Table 2 may\nrequire only 17.76 nanograms of ionized Helium for each year of continuous operation. Although specific impulse is\nnot strictly appropriate for this class of engine, this ion lifetime gives an equivalent specific impulse of 1.86\xc3\x9710 17\nseconds for the engine design defined in Table 2. Ions in the beam guide could be replenished by injection from a\nsecondary linear accelerator, a technique currently used in synchrotrons. Ion lifetime may be increased by operating\nthe engine continuously because this could gradually eliminate contamination in the beam guide. It is also possible\nthe engine could harvest helium from its surrounding environment or the power generation source. Alpha particles\ncan be produced during radioactive decay.\nModeling indicates the engine architecture will produce measurable torque around the z-axis if the radii of inner\nand outer cores are not equal. This may be beneficial, and the design could be adapted by substituting electrons for\nions in a compact cyclotron/microwave tube assembly to replace satellite reaction wheels. A pair of engines with\ncounter-rotating ions could produce and manage torque.\nD. Engine Efficiency\nThrust can be improved by designing the beam guide to operate with higher ion velocity, however the required\naccelerator power and magnetic field also increase. A strong magnetic field is required to bend the ion\xe2\x80\x99s direction of\ntravel so that it remains in the center of the beam guide and does not impact the walls of the vacuum chamber. The\naccelerator applies an in-line (parallel) force to accelerate ions, which scales proportionally to \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe 3. Since the beam\nguide is curved, most of the momentum exchange at each end of the engine is perpendicular to the ion\xe2\x80\x99s direction of\ntravel unless the ion is traveling at an extremely high velocity. As a result, most of the momentum transfer forces in\nthe top and bottom bends are proportional to \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe until the ion velocity approaches the speed of light. When ion velocity\napproaches the speed of light, the \xf0\x9d\x9b\xbe 3 momentum term in the ends of the engine begins to dominate. Fig 7 shows the\neffect of increasing the minimum velocity using a constant input power of 165 MW. Thrust efficiency increases\ndramatically for ion velocities at or above 99.99 %c, however the peak required magnetic field also increases rapidly.\nFor comparison, the Large Hadron Collider can accelerate ions to 99.9999991 %c with a beam guide circumference\nof 27 kilometers and magnetic fields that exceed 8 T [5].\nIf most of the power in the decelerator can be recovered, then higher average ion velocities may improve overall\nsystem efficiency. The total length of the beam guide decreases as the minimum ion velocity increases for a given\napplied power level because the range of the radius of curvature in the accelerator/decelerator sections decreases.\nFuture designs could alter the ends of the engine to make momentum transfer more of a direct reflection (parallel\nforce). Additional beam guides could be \xe2\x80\x9cwoven\xe2\x80\x9d into the architecture shown in Fig 4 to increase thrust.\n\n7\n\nFig. 7 Thrust and Peak Magnetic Field for a Constant Applied Power of 165 MW.\n\nIV. Conservation of Momentum\nThe high required power and low resulting thrust seem to imply the principle of conservation of momentum is\npresent, however the engine theoretically continues to accelerate if it has power. There are several ways momentum\ncan be conserved from a global perspective.\nThe process of increasing and decreasing the ion\xe2\x80\x99s relativistic momentum along with producing the required power\nmay distribute the momentum change to the surrounding environment external to the engine. Some process must be\nused to generate the required power, and this process could conserve momentum in a global sense. This is difficult to\nquantify, given the current abstract method for modeling the engine\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\nThe ions inside the engine may accumulate an offsetting momentum. For example, the ions may develop spin\nduring each trip around the engine. This spin could eventually lower or even halt engine thrust. Ion spin is dependent\non the specific beam guide implementation design and is not currently modelled in RMTM. This is an area where a\nmore detailed model or testing would be very useful. It may be possible to mitigate ion spin by using a pair of counterrotating Helical Engines that share a single beam guide. This technique could prevent ion spin from accumulating\nduring subsequent round trips through the engine. A pair of counter-rotating Helical Engines could also be used to\nmanage torque.\nAnother possibility for momentum conservation is beam guide emissions. The beam guide requires strong\nmagnetic fields to bend the ion\xe2\x80\x99s direction of travel and high electric fields to alter the ion\xe2\x80\x99s velocity. Ions traveling\nin the beam guide produce x-ray emissions during each circuit. These fields and emissions may radiate energy to the\nsurrounding area that would balance the accelerating engine.\n\nV. Future Work\nAnchoring the Relativistic Momentum Transfer Model with relevant test data is essential to continuing the\nresearch. Modeling the momentum of charged particles moving at relativistic velocities around an arbitrarily curved\npath is complex and the magnitudes of velocity and resulting forces span many orders of magnitude. Small round-off\nerrors could propagate into larger errors during each simulation. RMTM has been evaluated using basic checks, such\nas calculating consistent thrust near boundary conditions; generating zero net thrust for non-helical architectures; and\nproviding stable predictions for a wide range of simulation step sizes. However, RMTM needs to be validated and\nverified through the testing of helical beam guide shapes in a synchrotron.\nThe Helical Engine design can be improved based on RMTM simulations. The design currently uses a tapered\npower distribution profile in the accelerator and decelerator sections. This causes ripples, which account for small\nnegative forces in the accelerator and decelerator as listed in Table 2. If power was applied and removed using a more\noptimum technique, then there would be less z-axis force losses during transitions in and out of these sections. The\nengine design could also be improved so that more of the momentum exchange at each end results in parallel instead\n\n8\n\nof perpendicular force based on the ion\xe2\x80\x99s direction of travel. This could greatly increase engine power efficiency and\nimprove operation at higher minimum ion velocity. Replacing ions with electrons would greatly decrease engine\nthrust, but would simplify construction, reduce costs, lower power requirements, and validate the concept.\n\nVI. Conclusions\nProducing 1 N of thrust using megawatts of power and a space-rated synchrotron is not a compelling reason to\nbuild this engine \xe2\x80\x93 however the concept can theoretically produce thrust even though the engine is inside an enclosed\nvolume. There are many paths to make the engine more efficient and powerful.\nKey benefits: the engine can operate indefinitely without significant refueling; be energy efficient (provided the\ndecelerator energy is harvested); be reliable as ions are the only moving part; and have an extremely high speed. The\nengine could be powered by solar energy for satellite station keeping or a nuclear reactor for interstellar travel [6]. It\nmay be the only practical long duration interstellar engine based on existing technology. The Helical Engine is\npossible because of recent innovations: an engine architecture that conserves propellant and offers an opportunity to\nrecover energy used to accelerate ions; lightweight, efficient, space-rated, neutrally-charged particle beam components\ndeveloped by National Laboratories; space-qualified nuclear reactor technology developed by NASA; and lightweight\nmagnets and high efficiency undulators developed for producing synchrotron radiation in particle accelerators.\nChallenges include significant engineering design hurdles and trades. Particle accelerators can produce intense xrays and are traditionally designed for nuclear chemistry, with magnets, shielding, and detectors often weighing\nhundreds of tons. There are numerous technical challenges to be addressed before a practical engine can be realized:\na)\n\nEfficient power collection and transfer from the decelerator to the accelerator is key to the feasibility of\nthis class of propulsion. This technology is mature for producing low current spectrally pure energy from\nelectrons, but it has not been developed for continually producing high current from heavier ions. The\nproposed engine architecture requires high current and high efficiency.\nb) The design is not proven or optimized, and the author\xe2\x80\x99s system level models need to be examined by the\nparticle accelerator technical community. The point design described in Table 2 can be improved, with\ntradeoffs between applied magnetic field, ion density, power, cycle time, and thrust. Many design\nparameters are dependent on power, ion chemistry, curvature, and minimum ion velocity.\nc) High temperature materials and components, including high efficiency electromagnets. Revolutionary\nmaterial advances, including superconducting magnets designed and manufactured for the Large Hadron\nCollider [5], may enable the proposed engine. New particle accelerator designs can be optimized for high\ncurrent and low mass \xe2\x80\x93 suitable for space propulsion but not traditional nuclear chemistry applications. A\nspace-based neutrally charged particle beam missile interceptor was designed and flight-tested by the Los\nAlamos National Laboratory in 1989 but was not fielded due to a shift in national strategy [7].\nThe Helical Engine could be an interesting testbed for exploring the relationship of Conservation of Momentum\nto mass, force, and energy.\n\nReferences\n[1] Harold White, Paul March, James Lawrence, Jerry Vera, Andre Sylvester, David Brady, and Paul Bailey.
