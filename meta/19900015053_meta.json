Developing an adequate supply of technicians to meet the requirements of the materials related industry will be a challenge and difficult to accomplish. A variety of agencies feel the need and wish to support development of engineering materials technology programs. In a joint effort among Battelle Laboratories, the Department of Energy (DOE) and Northwest College and University Association for Science (NORCUS), the development of an engineering materials technology program for vocational programs and community colleges for the Pacific Northwest Region was recently completed. This effort has implications for a national model. The model Associate of Applied Science degree in Engineering Materials Technology shown provides a general structure. It purposely has course titles which need delimiting while also including a core of courses necessary to develop cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills with the underlining principles of math, science and technology so students have job entry skills, and so that students can learn about and adapt to evolving technology.", "title": "Preparing technicians for engineering materials technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900015053, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jacobs, James A."}, "organization": {"name": "Norfolk State Univ.", "location": "VA., United States"}}, "id": "88679482b29e41369c5b38ee36dd09c7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900015053, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Metzloff, Carlton H."}, "organization": {"name": "Erie Community Coll.", "location": "Buffalo, NY., United States"}}, "id": "392783f83fd14171ba572eeb2336f924"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900015053, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900015053, "id": "6a7510200f6b4ac59597e6951e109414", "publicationName": "NASA, Langley Research Center, National Educators' Workshop: Update 1989 Standard Experiments in Engineering Materials Science and Technology", "publicationDate": "1990-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900015053.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900015053/downloads/19900015053.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900015053/downloads/19900015053.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900015053/downloads/19900015053.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
