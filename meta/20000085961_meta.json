The mission holds the promise for answering many of the outstanding astrophysical questions associated with Galactic cosmic rays and their role in our Galaxy. ACCESS science goals include measurement of the rare ultra-high energy and ultra-heavy components of cosmic radiation which have not been analyzed previously above the Earth's atmosphere. The critical resource made available by the ISS is collection factor (area x exposure time), as much as 10,000 square meters-sr-days for a four-year stay on-orbit. This will allow ACCESS to go beyond balloon-borne detectors and take the science of cosmic-ray observation to the threshold of space. The ACCESS instrument, consisting of a charge module, a transition radiation detector, and a calorimeter, should make valuable measurements of nuclei throughout the periodic table up to 1015 eV. The concept, options, mission plan, and accommodation issues for such an ISS payload are summarized. This includes the carrier, ISS Site, mass, thermal control, power, data and operations. The study demonstrates that the ISS, as a stable science platform at the threshold of space, makes improved cosmic-ray ACCESS possible at the turn of the century.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000085961, "id": "302c9e79767143febdf01d526de71895", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
