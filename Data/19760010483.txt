Funds were provided by the Mexican government and by\nthe United Nations. The World Bank was the executing agency for UNDP fund and assisted\nalso in selecting and hiring foreign personnel.\nPresent land use studies were carried out all over the country (197 million hectares);\nnine soil uses were mapped according to the first classification level recommended by\nthe U. S. Geological Survey. Also 6.3 million hectares of land with advanced erosion\nwere detected. Work was executed at a rate of 8 million hectares per month; reliability\nwas 90% and the cost of only 0.1 cents/hectare.\nThe potential land use study was performed in 45 million hectares at a rate of 4 million\nhectares per month and at a cost of 0.33 cents/hectare. Soil units according to FAQ classification were delineated scale 1:1 million; interpretative maps were also prepared dealing with potential agricultural productivity carrying capacity for cattle, water, erosion risk, and slope ranges.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBy the end of 1972, the Mexican Water Plan (MWP) started working with its main objective\nof developing systematic water resources planning procedures for the country. The Mexican Government made an agreement with the United Nations Development Program in order to\nmake use of foreign expertise when needed. At the same time, it made a commitment of sharing the MWP\'s experiences with other countries. One fourth of the 4 million dollar project was provided by the UN, and the rest by the Mexican Government. The World Bank was\nthe executing agency for the UNDP funds, providing assistance in selecting and hiring foreign experts.\nIn Mexico, agriculture is by far the largest water consuming activity. Water resources\nplanning is thus carried out within a physical framework, where the two most important resources are water and soil. This physical framework strongly interacts with a comprehensive socio-economic framework in the planning process.\n\n1823\n\nMETHODS\n\nFigure 1 shows the Mexican soil studies stages using LANDSAT Satellite imagery. The MWP defined a work program for a 33 month period project, which included soil inventories as one\nof the main inputs. Water requirements for irrigated agriculture accounts for more than\n95% of the country\'s total water consumption. Therefore, soil inventories are as import\nas water inventories for successful water resources planning.\nOnly the FAO soils map was available for the whole country, as well as many local soil studies covering small areas, when the MWP project was started. Very good present and potential\n1:50,000 scale land use maps are being developed in Mexico by CETENAL (Comisifin de Estudios\ndel Territorio Nacional). Unfortunately, the FAO soils map is too general, and not suitable for water resources planning. On the other hand, CETENAL maps are excellent but cover\nless than a third of the country at present time.\nThe MWP staff defined the objectives for the present and potential land studies and sketched\npreliminary procedures. Afterwards, two seminars were conducted in Mexico City in order to\ndefine the final procedures to study present and potential land use using LANDSAT-1 imagery. I/ A well experienced U.S. Soil Conservation Service scientist and two leading U.S.\nexperts in LANDSAT imagery were selected to participate in the seminars.\nThe whole country was surveyed with present land use studies and maps scale 1:1 million were\nprepared, while only 45 million Ha were covered with potential land use studies. The areas\nto study potential use were selected from regions with less than 10% slope where water is\nstill available for agriculture development.\nA short training course on image interpretation for present land use purposes was then given\nby one of the remote sensing experts, and a Mexican consulting firm conducted the study. In\na two-year period the whole country was mapped at a 1:1,000,000 scale with a cost of 200\nthousand U. S. dollars, i.e. 0.1 cents/hectare. The areas where potential land use studies would later be carried on were given first priority.\nThe potential land use study was started 6 months later since present land use information\nwas needed as an input. The other LANDSAT expert and the soil scientist led two pilot studies\nwhile adjusting the proposed methodology, along with experienced soil scientist of another\nMexican consulting firm. They made six one-week trips to Mexico during the following year\nto carry on the study. With each trip, they functioned more as a review team, while the\nleadership and responsibility of the study was turned over to the Mexican soil scientists.\nMore than a fifth of the country was studied in a year with a cost of roughly 150 thousand\ndollars; i.e. 0.33 cents/hectare. Also 1:1,000,000 maps were finally produced.\nThe results of both present and potential land use studies have improved the Mexican soil resources inventories as a by-product of the water resources planning itself. The integration\nof results contributed significantly to improve the regional water resources planning process.\nA summary of results of both studies, as well as their integration is presented. Finally,\nto accomplish the commitment with the United Nations, an outline of a step-by-step handbook\nto make land use studies using LANDSAT imagery, presently under preparation, is submitted\nfor discussion. Suggestions from the Symposium will help MWP in making a useful contribution to the field of remote sensing technology.\n\nII Gardufio, H., Garcia Lagos, R., Garcia Simo, F. y Perez Gavilan, D., UTILIZACION DE LAS IMA\nGENES DEL SATELITE ERTS-1 EN LA PLANEACION DE LOS RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS, Primer Congreso\nPanamericano y Tercero Nacional de Fotogrametria, Fotointerpretacion y Geodesia, Mexico,\n1974.\n1824\n\nPRESENT LAND USE STUDY\n\nThe objectives of this study were.\n1) To survey present land use in the whole country.\ngated agricultural land and on ralnfed areas.\n2)\n\nSpecial emphasis was placed on irri-\n\nTo provide basic information to determine potential land use and to compare later the\nresults of present and potential land use studies.\n\nFalse infrared color transparencies using channels 4, 5, and 7 from LANDSAT were used. The\nU.S. Geological Survey First Classification level recommendations-^ were followed with slight\nmodifications to interpret the 200 images that cover the country. Since agricultural land\nwas the main interest of study, images taken during the dry and rainy seasons were used.\nThis made it possible to discriminate irrigated from rainfed agriculture.\nThe project included intensive low altitude flights and ground-truth trips, as well as comparison with detailed 1:50,000 CETENAL maps. Table I shows the reliability for each present\nland use mapped.\nIn southeastern tropical Mexico Skylab IR color photographs were used where cloud-free LANDSAT\nimages were not available. Since only visual interpretations techniques were used, those\nareas densely covered by vegetation were especially difficult to interpret. Future efforts\nwill also utilize methods which take advantage of spectral computer-aided scanning.\n\nTABLE\n\nI.\n\nRELIABILITY OF THE PRESENT LAND USE STUDY RESULTS\n\nMinimum mapping\nUnit\n\nMore common mixed\ninterpretations\n\nReliability\n\n%\n\nLand Use\n\nCode\n\nIrrigated cropland\nFlat rainfed cropland\nSteep rainfed cropland\nRange and grassland\nWoodland (conifer and\nhardwood)\nTropical forest! and\nShrub/Scrubland\nBarren land\nWetland\nWater bodies\nUrban areas\nErosion\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\n50\n100\n150\n250\n\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\n\n(2)\n(1)\n(1)\n(3)\n\n(3)\n(3)\n(2)\n(7)\n\n95\n90\n85\n85\n\n(5)\n\n250\n250\n250\n300\n200\n50\n100\n300\n\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\nHa\n\n(6) and (7)\n(5) and (7)\n(5) and (6)\n(4)\n(1)\n\n90\n85\n85\n85\n95\n98\n95\n85\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(a)\n(u)\n(e)\n\nand\nand\nand\nand\n\n90\n\nAverage\nNote 1.

Each\nmap includes a detailed description for each use, which takes into account regional differences found within the country. A grid formed by squares of one half degree latitude and\none half degree longitude was superimposed onto the maps and supporting area statistics\nwere calculated for each land use type on the basis of state, MWP regions and individual\ncharts. The hectares covered by each used with advanced erosion was also computed. Fig. 2-A\nshows a generalization of results for the whole country.\nComparison with\ntions; however,\nof 30.0 million\nlion Ha of land\n\ncensal figures is usually meaningless due to differences in land use definiit is interesting to point out that while censal data indicated that an area\nHa is completely eroded, the present land use study detected only 6.3 milwith advanced erosion.\nDuration, Manpower, and Cost\n\nFigure 3 shows the schedule of activities for the present land use study. Once the procedure was defined and the interpreters trained a set of straight forward: steps were followed\nfor each one of the 17 land use charts. However, a major change was made in the original\nmethodology, when ground truth proved to need a far greater effort than was at first\nanticipated.\nTable II shows the manpower used in the study and Table III shows an estimate of costs\nfor the whole study which covered 197 million hectares.

Overlays with general delineations of present land use naps, geology,\nrainfall, FAO soil units and infrastructure were used to help image interpretation. Also\nmore reconnaissance flights and ground truth trips with more intensive sampling were required than by the present land use study.\nThe soil units classification was taken from the 1:2,000,000 scale FAO map, but a far more\ndetailed soil units map was produced after interpreting the images with the aid of the overlays mentioned above as well as the air and ground truth. The potential land use .classification mas made according tho Handbook 210 of the U.S.Soil Conservation Service.-\'\nFinally, interpretative maps were produced for agriculture and pasture use, slope classification, and water erosion risk. A reliability of 80% to 90% was determined by comparing\nresults of the study with available more detailed results of conventional soil surveys.\n\nResults\nFigure 4 shows the soil unit delineations obtained following the FAO soil classification system. Image interpretation was determinant in defining more precisely the soil unit boundaries and produced more details than the original FAO map showed.\nPotential land use maps were prepared based on the properties of the FAO soil units, yield\nand production statistics, results from agriculture and livestock experimental stations,\nfield observations, and personal experience of the soil scientists that carried out the study.\nEstimates of yields were made for the most important crops as well as evaluations of carrying\ncapacity under grass for cattle feeding in each soil unit. Figure 5 shows the general results for agriculture productivity.\nOnly 17 million Ha were found to have high and moderate agricultural potential productivity.\nThis figure seems low, taking into account that the study was carried out in selected areas\naccording to slope. However, large areas in the south east were classified under present\nconditions as of low productivity due to seasonal flooding. It is believed that with\nadequate flood protection and drainage measures, they could easily be considered as areas\nof high productivity since the soils are deep, flat, and fertile.\nThe potential range and grass productivity was determined only in 29.7 million Ha since estimates of carrying capacity per hectare were not available in the north western and central\nregions of the country. Figure 6 shows the general results. A large proportion of the area\nI/ I lingebiel, A.A., and Montgomery, P.H. LAND CAPABILITY CLASSIFICATION. Agriculture Handbook No. 210, Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1973.\n1827\n\nwas found to have from medium to high productivity (23 million Ha). Most of the land is located in the Gulf coastal plains and on the south eastern regions where most of the country\'s\npresent livestock production is concentrated.\nFinally, Figure 7 shows areas with different degree of water erosion risk. Even though the\nstudied areas lie mostly on flat lands, 69% of the 45 million Ha shows medium to high water\nerosion risk. This fact points out the need for sound soil conservation programs and policies.\nDuration, Manpower, and Cost\nFigure 8 shows a schedule of activities for the potential land use study. A line-production\nprocedure was not feasible and separate package studies were carried out in each selected\narea. The reason for this is that integration of image interpretation, basic data, field\nnotes and personal experience should be borne to a great extent in the mind of the soil scientist in order to finish up a specific area. Hence, one area had to be finished by each\nteam before starting studies on the next one. Two teams were responsible for the whole project.\nTable IV shows the manpower used in the study and Table V shows an estimate of costs for the\nwhole study which covered 45 million hectares. The reported total cost of U.S. $150,000,00\ndoesn\'t cover air checking nor foreign personnel expenses.\nTABLE IV.

However, there are 535 thousand Ka of low productivity areas presently being irrigated and 3.6 million Ha with rainfed agriculture of the same\nproductivity class. On the other hand, 3.9 million Ha with high potential agricultural productivity remain unfarmed.\nIt is also important to point out that 41% of 16.6 million Ha presently being used within\nthe area studied, are in high danger of being eroded. Most of these areas have rainfed agriculture, since most irrigated land lies in areas with low risk of erosion. This was expected, as well as the fact that 15.6 million Ha with medium to high risk of water erosion are\nnot being farmed.\nThere are large areas in the Gulf coastal plains with low potential agricultural productivity\nand medium to high risk of water erosion. These areas should be mainly devoted to pasture\nland, taking care not to over-graze them.\nDetailed studies using these results are presently carried on at MWP in order to define future regional water resources development related to agriculture, livestock, and soil conservation.\nOUTLINE OF A STEP-BY-STEP SOILS HANDBOOK USING LANDSAT SATELLITE IMAGERY\n\nThe MWP soils group is preparing a handbook covering the points outlined below.\nComments and suggestions from the Symposium participants are welcome. It is important to\npoint out that for the sake of clarity it is intended that each step will be illustrated\nin detail with figures and in a general way, the results for the whole country will also be\ndiscussed.\n1.

Integration of present and potential land use studies\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe use of LANDSAT imagery has made it possible to make land use inventory maps scale\n1:1,000,000 in Mexico with an extremely low cost in a two-year period. The Agriculture\nMinistry is already carrying out a new inventory scale 1:500,000.\nThe objectives of the present land use study were met, with an overall reliability of 90%.\nHowever, only a small fraction of the information contained in the images was used.\nThe next steps in using LANDSAT in Mexico will include study of dynamic changes in land use,\ncomputer aided spectral scanning, more detailed studies of areas of interest at wider scales\n(1:250,000), etc.\nThe potential land use maps were developed faster and at a lower cost than would have been\npossible using any of the conventional methods. A reliability of 90% was also accomplished\nin these studies.\nThe integration of both present and potential land use maps is extremely useful in providing\norientations for regional development of water resources in agricultural countries with\nsparse water supplies; it also helps to set forth policies about land redistribution according to capability and water erosion risks.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nMessrs.
