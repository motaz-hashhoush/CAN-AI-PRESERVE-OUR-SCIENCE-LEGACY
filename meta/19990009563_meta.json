Since the low masses of these satellites enable multiple spacecraft per launch, the ability to add spacecraft to a given launch was used as a figure of merit. When compared to chemical propulsion, the Hall thruster system can add additional spacecraft per launch using planned payload power levels. One satellite can be added to the assumed four satellite baseline chemical launch without additional mission times. Two or three satellites may be added by providing part of the orbit insertion with the Hall system. In these cases orbit insertion times were found to be 35 and 62 days. Depending, on the electric propulsion scenario, the resulting launch vehicle savings is nearly two, three or four Delta 7920 launch vehicles out of the chemical baseline scenario's eight Delta 7920 launch vehicles.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990009563, "endDate": "1998-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Johns Hopkins Univ.", "location": "Columbia, MD United States"}}, "meetingId": "6cb8ce113e13463b83e0619aafd85216", "id": "c107ba7b57ca4952882c9f707e137373"}], "name": "Propulsion", "location": "Cleveland, OH", "id": "6cb8ce113e13463b83e0619aafd85216", "startDate": "1998-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990009563, "id": "e4b8256994964489b4423ad92b80abcf", "publicationDate": "1998-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990009563.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990009563/downloads/19990009563.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990009563/downloads/19990009563.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990009563/downloads/19990009563.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
