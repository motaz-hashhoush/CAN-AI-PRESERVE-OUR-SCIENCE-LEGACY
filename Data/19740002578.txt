molecules by solid surfaces has been\n\nthe subject of a large number of investigations for many\nyears.\n\nMolecular adsorption from the gas or liquid phase\n\nplays an important role in technical processes such as the\npurification of gases and liquids, dyeing of materials, and\nsurface catalysis.\n\nAdsorption from the gas phase, in par-\n\nticular, is an essential mechanism for the operation of\ncryogenic vacuum pumps.\na desirable process.\n\nHowever, adsorption is not always\n\nThe presence of even a monolayer of\n\nadsorbed gas can sometimes lead to significant degradation\nof a device whose performance is strongly dependent on its\nsurface properties, e.g.,\ncoatings.\n\nthermionic emitters and optical\n\nDesigners of vehicles operating in the space\n\nenvironment as well as designers of ultra-high vacuum\nsystems are especially concerned with preventing contamination of critical surfaces.\n\nThus, a strong interest exists\n\nin the adsorptive behavior of a variety of gas-surface\ncombinations under conditions where the adsorbate coverage\nconstitutes one monolayer or less.\nAdsorption may be defined as that process which causes\n\n1\n\n2\nthe molecular density near the surface to be higher than\nthe density in the gas phase.\n\nAdsorption is classified\n\naccording to the nature of the forces which cause it.\n\nIf\n\nthe adsorption is caused by weak, van der Waals forces, it\nis known as physical adsorption or, simply, physisorption.\nIf the adsorption involves the transfer or sharing of electrons between the gas and solid atoms, it is then known as\nchemical adsorption or, simply, chemisorption.\n\nPhysical\n\nadsorption is characterized by the fact that the resulting\nbinding energies between the gas and solid are usually of\nthe same order of magnitude as the heat of liquefaction of\nthe gas.\nAdsorption, in general, is the result of competition\nbetween the adsorption rate (rate of deposition) and\ndesorption rate (rate of evaporation).\n\nWhen the adsorption\n\nrate exceeds the desorption rate, the surface coverage\nincreases with time; conversely, when the desorption rate is\ngreater, the surface coverage decreases.\n\nOf course, once\n\nthe gas-solid system has achieved a state of thermodynamic\nequilibrium, the adsorption and desorption rates must be\nequal and the surface coverage remains constant.\nThe majority of experimental studies of adsorption have\nbeen carried out under conditions where the gas-solid system\nwas allowed to reach a state of equilibrium.\n\nIn most cases,\n\nthe approach to equilibrium was quite rapid and adsorption\n\n3\nwas considered to occur spontaneously (1 ) .\n\nWhile this type\n\nof study gives useful information on equilibrium surface\ncoverage, more information can be obtained about the adsorption history of a given molecule from non-equilibrium\nexperiments.\n\nFor example, the time and surface coverage\n\ndependence of adsorption and desorption probabilities can be\ndetermined, in principle at least, from a detailed knowledge\nof the adsorption and desorption rates.\nOne approach to obtaining the non-equilibrium information is to measure the mean stay time (sometimes called\ndwell time, residence time, or sticking time) that adsorbed\nmolecules spend on the surface.\n\nThe idea that a molecule\n\nstriking a surface spends a finite time on the surface was\nfirst proposed by Langmuir(2) and later was developed by\nFrenkel (3 ) from statistical mechanics.\n\nThe stay time con-\n\ncept has been examined at length by deBoer\n\nto show its\n\nusefulness in understanding both the equilibrium properties\nof adsorption and the mechanisms which govern the rate at\nwhich equilibrium is reached.\n\nTherefore, knowledge of the\n\nstay time is of considerable value in the study of adsorption.\n\n1.2\n\nStay-Time Measurement\nIn order to determine the requirements for measuring\n\n4\nthe stay time, it is necessary to examine the expected\nbehavior.\n\nFor a first-order desorption process (desorption\n\nflux proportional to surface coverage), the Frenkel model\npredicts that the mean stay time is proportional to\nexp(E /kT s ) where E o is the binding energy, k is the\nBoltzmann constant, and T s is the temperature of the solid\nat its surface.\n\nFor physisorption, where E o is comparable\n\nto the heat of vaporization, stay times become measurable\nonly as the temperature approaches the liquefaction temperature of the gas which, for many gases of interest, is below\nroom temperature.\n\nAlso, based on the predicted exponential\n\ndependence, the stay time will increase rapidly with\ndecreasing temperature.\n\nWhile large stay times (of the\n\norder of seconds) are more easily measured, they in turn\nlead to large surface coverage.\n\nThus, if low surface\n\ncoverage is of interest, stay-time magnitudes must be\nlimited.\n\n1.3\n\nThe Present Experiments\nThe purpose of the present experiments was to examine\n\na method suited to the measurement of stay times greater\nthan a few microseconds.\n\nThe technique was one in which a\n\nthermal energy, molecular beam was pulsed and the pulse of\nmolecules was directed onto the surface.\n\nThe subsequent\n\n5\ndesorption rate was detected and the time evolution of the\ndetected pulse was used to infer a mean stay time.\n\nFor this\n\ntechnique, molecular transit times were important, but they\nwere measured as part of the experiment and their effects on\nthe shape of the detected pulse were taken into account.\nThe experiments were conducted over a range of surface\ntemperatures such that the stay time varied by at least an\norder of magnitude about the mean molecular transit time.\nMethods for estimating the stay time from the detected\npulse were evaluated over this range of stay times.\n\nThe\n\neffects of varying the gas species, the incident-pulse\nduration, the incident molecular flux, the surface material\nand means of preparation, and ion bombardment of the surface have been studied.\n\nCHAPTER 2\nTHEORY AND BACKGROUND\n\n2.1\n\nTheory\nAs mentioned in the introduction, it was Langmuir(2)\n\nwho first proposed that a gas molecule striking a surface\nwould spend a finite time before departing.\n\nPrior to his\n\nproposal, it was thought that a critical temperature Tc\nexisted such that, for T >Tc , molecules were reflected\ninstantaneously and, for T< Tc, atoms were permanently\nadsorbed.\nThe stay-time concept was first developed quantitatively by Frenkel( 3 ) using the methods of classical\nstatistical mechanics.\n\nHe assumed that:\n\n(1) an individual gas molecule is bound to a\nsurface with energy Eo\n(2) the number of molecules adsorbed is sufficiently small that interactions among\nthemselves are negligible;\n(3) adsorbed molecules retain two translational\ndegrees of freedom parallel to the surface;\n(4) internal degrees of freedom can be ignoreds\n(5) an adsorbed molecule is bound as a simple\none-dimensional harmonic oscillator vibrating\n\n6\n\n7\nperpendicular to the surface with frequency\n(o (period T o = 27r/o):\n(6) the gas-solid system is in thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\nFrenkel\'s derived result for the mean stay time - is:\n\nT =\n\no exp(E /kT)\n\n(2.1.1)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the gas-solid system and k is\nthe Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis relation has been widely used\n\nto predict mean stay times as well as to infer values\nof 7o\nand Eo from experimental observations of the temperature\ndependence of 7.\nThe physical significance of the mean stay time may be\nillustrated by considering the desorption of an ensemble of\nmolecules by a first-order rate process.\n\nIf oa is the num-\n\nber of molecules adsorbed per unit area at any time t and\nPd is the probability of desorption per unit time, then\n\nda\n\na\n\nt\n\n= -Pdo\n\nda\n\n(2.1.2)\n\nIf Pd is constant, Eq. (2.1.2) may be integrated to give\n\naa(t) = Oa(O)exp(-Pdt)\n\n(2.1.3)\n\nThe mean stay time for the ensemble is\n\n1\n\n/daa\\\ndt\n!dt\n\n(0)\n\n(2.1.4)\n\na\n\nSubstituting for a (t) from Eq. (2.1.3) and integrating\nyields\n\nr = 1/Pd\n\n(2.1.5)\n\nThis interpretation of the mean stay time is usually valid\nas long as the surface coverage is much less than a monolayer.\n\nAt higher surface coverages, adsorbate-adsorbate\n\ninteractions become significant and the process is no\nlonger first order.\n\nIn this case, a mean stay time is still\n\ndefined by Eq. (2.1.4), but it is meaningful only when the\ncoverage history is also specified.\nAlthough the Frenkel relation, Eq. (2.1.1), is widely\nused, more general predictions of theoretical stay times\nhave been presented by deBoer\n\n(4 \' 5 ) .\n\nThe initial development\n\nof these predictions is similar to that of Frenkel and\nfollows directly from consideration of steady-state\nconditions, i.e.,\n\nwhere the desorption rate equals the\n\nadsorption rate.\n\nIf F i is the incident flux and Pa is the\n\n9\nadsorption probability (sometimes called sticking probability), it follows for first-order desorption that\n\n= Pa F\n\na\n\n(2.1.6)\n\nThe flux F i is usually known from the state of the system\n(e.g., temperature and pressure).\n\nFor example, for a gas in\n\nequilibrium with the surface, the kinetic theory of gases\npredicts\n\nFkT\nK2 gJ\n\nFi =\n\n(2.1.7)\n\nfor a gas of number density ng and molecular mass mg.\nSubstituting this into Eq. (2.1.6) and solving for -, one\nobtains\n\n1\n\na\n\n27rm\n\na\\ kT\n\nng\n\n(2.1.8)\n\nFor a system of volume V and adsorbing surface of area As,\n\nnga\n\nA\n\nn As\n\n(Na\nNV\n\ngN\n\n(2.1.9)\n\n10\n\nare the total number of molecules in the\n\nwhere N a and N\n\nadsorbed phase and gas phase, respectively.\n\nEq. (2.1.8)\n\ncan then be written as\n\n1\n\n2rm\n\nkT\n\nPa\n\nNa\n\n(2.1.10)\n\nAs\n\nThis relation provides a convenient starting point for the\nprediction of 7 by the methods of equilibrium statistical\nmechanics.\nThe evaluation of 7 from Eq. (2.1.10) has been treated\nby deBoer\n\nusing classical statistical mechanics.\n\nThe\n\nresults for mobile and localized adsorption are of particular interest.\n\nMobile adsorption refers to the case where\n\nmolecules are bound to the surface but move freely in directions parallel to the surface.\n\nLocalized adsorption refers\n\nto the case where molecules are bound so strongly in local\nsites that their translational motion parallel to the surface is negligible.\n\nThe development for these two cases is\n\ngiven in Appendix I, and a simple extension of deBoer\'s\napproach is proposed which includes some quantum-mechanical\neffects.\n\nFor a mobile adsorbed gas, the result is\n\n7\n\n=\nsinh(OD/4T)\n\nroexp(Eo/kT)\n\n(2.1.11)\n\nwhere 8D is the Debye temperature of the solid.\n\nIn the\n\nhigh-temperature limit (T>>OD), Frenkel\'s result is\nobtained.\n\nHowever, for T<OD, the predicted values for T\n\nare substantially less than those predicted by the Frenkel\nexpression.\nThe result for localized adsorption is given by\n\n7h2a m\nmgk\n\nD\n\n(D/2T)\n\n2\n\n[2sinh(0D4T)]3\n\noe(E/kT\n\nwhere am is the monolayer surface coverage and\nPlanck\'s constant.\n\n2nfr\n\n(2.1.12)\n\nis\n\nThe high-temperature limit for this\n\nexpression is of course altogether different from the\nFrenkel expression.\nThe quantitative differences in stay times predicted\nby Eqs. (2.1.11) and (2.1.12) may be illustrated by writing\nthese equations in the form\n\n7 = r o exp (E/kT)\n\n(2.1.13)\n\n12\nThus, for a given binding energy and temperature, one need\nonly investigate the behavior of the preexponential factor\nS0.\n\nSample calculations given in Appendix I for xenon on\n\nnickel at 100oK show that \'7\nslightly less than 7r,\n\nfor mobile adsorption is only\n\nboth being of the order of 10 - 1 3 sec.\n\nHowever, for localized adsorption, ro is of the order of\n10- 1 7 sec.\n\nTherefore, stay times are expected to depend\n\nconsiderably on the type of adsorption process.\nThe general form of Eq. (2.1.10) allows a natural\nextension of the theory to include such effects as restriction of internal and rotational degrees of freedom as well\nas a more exact quantum-mechanical treatment of bound\nstates\n\n.\n\nAn analysis of first-order non-equilibrium adsorption\nhas been carried out by Pagni(1 0\n\n)\n\nusing a classical mole-\n\ncular collision model and non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics.\n\nHis results for steady-state adsorption point\n\nout the explicit dependence of To on the binding energy.\nWhile the time-dependent case is also formulated, no solutions for -r are presented.\n\n2.2\n\nPrevious Experiments\nA number of stay-time measurements have been made\n\nprior to the present work.\n\nClausing(11), in the first\n\n13\nattempt to measure stay times, directed a stream of Cd\nvapor onto a rotating disk maintained at a constant temperature.\n\nThe atoms then desorbed and were collected by a\n\ncondensation plate.\n\nIt was expected that the mean stay time\n\ncould be inferred from the angular displacement of the condensate.\n\nHowever, the stay times encountered in these\n\nexperiments were less than the time-resolution of the apparatus (-10\n\n-6\n\nsec).\n\nClausing later devised a technique\n\nwhere the time for a gas pulse to diffuse through a capillary tube (1 2 ) was measured.\n\n3\nStay times as large as ~ 10 -\n\nsec were measured for Ar, Ne and N 2 on glass.\n\nRecent exper-\n\niments of this same general type have been conducted for He\non Cu near liquid helium temperature(13)\nRecent measurements of stay times have mainly involved\nthe use of modulated molecular beams (14 22) .\n\nMost of these\n\nstudies(1 6 - 22) have been conducted for chemisorbed gases.\nFor all such measurements, a molecular beam is interrupted in\nsome manner by a shutter prior to striking the surface of\ninterest.\n\nIf the shutter is opened (or closed) in a time\n\nthat is short compared to the stay time, the desorption rate\nis that for a step-like increase (or decrease) in the deposition rate.\n\nIf the beam is pulsed (shutter opened and\n\nclosed) and if the pulse time-width is small compared to the\nstay time, then the desorption rate is that for an instantaneously depop4+ed enemble.\n\nFor either type of fast\n\n14\nshutter behavior, the desorption rate for a first-order\nprocess is simply a function of the mean stay time.\n\nOther-\n\nwise, the desorption rate depends on the deposition history.\nAlso, if shutter-to-surface transit times are not negligible,\nthey must be taken into account.\n\nThe desorbing molecules\n\nare usually detected by some sort of flux- or densitysensitive detector placed in the desorption path.\n\nIf\n\nsurface-detector transit times are not small compared to\ntimes of interest, then these too must be taken into account.\nIn only two of these studies( 1 5 , 20) were shutter duration\nand transit-time effects evaluated in detail.\n\nIn the other\n\ncases, they were either negligible or were accounted for\napproximately.\nStay times have also been measured by the technique\ncommonly known as flash desorption.\n\nThe technique and its\n\nresults have been reviewed by Ehrlich(23).\n\nAlthough it is\n\nused primarily for determining binding energies, it has\nbeen used to estimate chemisorption stay times.\n\nThe disad-\n\nvantage of this technique is that the temperature dependence\nof the stay time must be known a priori.\nPhysisorption stay times have not been studied nearly\nso thoroughly as those for chemisorption.\n\nThis is due in\n\nlarge part to the experimental difficulties.\n\nThe present\n\nstudy investigates these difficulties and, under selected\nconditions, resolves them to a point where meaningful data\nare obtained.\n\nCHAPTER 3\nEXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\n\nIn this chapter, the molecular-beam and vacuum system,\nthe time-of-flight detection system, and the target and\ntarget preparation techniques are described.\n\nThe arrange-\n\nment of the various components is shown schematically in\nFig. 3.1.1.\n\nThe geometry of the beam-defining elements and\n\nthe time-of-flight (TOF) detection system is shown in Fig.\n3.1.2.\n\nThe vacuum system and instrumentation and the stay-\n\ntime apparatus are further described by the photographs\nof\n\nFigs. 3.1.3 and 3.1.4.\n\n3.1\n\nMolecular Beam and Vacuum System\nThe experiments were conducted in a stainless-steel\n\nvacuum chamber evacuated by a liquid-nitrogen-trapped,\noildiffusion pump. The chamber pressure was typically\n-8\n2 x 10\n\ntorr with no molecular-beam flow and about\n\n2 x 10 -7 torr with the beam on.\n\n(All test chamber pressures\n\nreported herein were measured using an ionization\ngauge\ncalibrated for nitrogen, and the quoted values\nare as-read\ngauge values.)\nHigh-purity (nominally 99.995%) gas was inlet\nto the\nmolecular beam source chamber through a variable\nleak valve.\n\n15\n\nCOLLIMATION\nCHAMBER\n\nCAPACITANCE\nMANOMETER\nMULTICHANNEL\nSOURCE CHAMBER\n\nCHAMBER WALL\n\nON GUN\nNGDETECTOR\n\nJ\n\n-\n\nFLOW-THROUGH\n\nI-I\nARGET\n\nGAS\nSUPPLY\nHOPPER\nHOPPER\n\nDETECTOR LOCATION FOR\nDIRECT BEAM MEASUREMENTS)\n\nVARIABLE\nLEAK VALVE\nLN 2 BAFFLE\n\nDIFFUSION PUMP\n\nFigure 3.1.1\n\nDIFFUSION PUMP\n\nSchematic of the Experimental Apparatus\n\n17\n\n27.9\n2.54-\n\nFLIGHT LENGTH\n\n1.27\n\nL=25.4\n\n1.4\nSOURCE EXIT\n\nACTIVE ZONE\n\nCOLLIMATOR\n\nACTIVE ZONE\nOF DETECTOR\n\nCHOPPER\n\nDETECTOR POSITION A\n\n(All dimensions in centimeters )\nDETECTOR\n\nA/-APERTURE\n\n-\n\nCHOPPER\n\n0 . 42\n\nCOLLIMATOR\n\n=4.3\nx 2 = 4. 36\n3.24\n\n17\n\nSOURCE\n\nTARGET\n\n3.33\nx 1 = 0.32\n\nDETECTOR POSITION B\n\nFigure 3.1.2\n\nGeometry of Beam-Target-Detector for\nIncident Beam and Stay-Time Measurements\n\nFigure3.~.3 Photogaph\n\no\n\nTOF DETECTION AND RECORDING\n\nER\n\nB\n\nDTECT\nINSTR\n\nOR\n\netatio\n\nLi\n\nINr\nN\n\n..\n\nhtgaho\n\ntyTm\n\nRE\n\nERVOM\n\npaau\n\n,\n\n20\nThe source chamber was maintained at ambient temperature\n(f 295\xc2\xb0K) and the source-chamber pressure p o was measured\nwith a capacitance-type electronic manometer.\nThe molecular beam was formed by a multichannel source,\na photograph of which is shown in Fig. 3.1.5.\n\nThis source\n\nis composed of a large number (0 1.7 x 104 ) of quartz\ncapillary tubes fused into an array and in turn fused in the\ncenter of the end plate of a 1.9 cm diameter glass tube.\nEach individual channel has a nominal diameter of 5 x 10 -4\n-4cm\nand a length of 0.15 cm.\n\nThe channels are assembled in a\n\nhexagonal pattern with a nominal overall diameter of 0.1 cm.\nThe molecular beam thus formed is then collimated by an\norifice as shown in Fig. 3.1.2.\nThe characteristics of the molecular beam formed by\nthis source were the subject of a separate investigation(2 4 )\nand are described in some detail in Appendix II.\n\nFrom\n\nmeasurements of the beam centerline flux and speed obtained\nin that study (with the detector in position A of Fig.\n3.1.2), the flux and energy of the beam striking the target\n(as shown by position B of Fig. 3.1.2) can be estimated.\nFor example, for Xe gas with p0 = 10 torr, the intensity of\nthe beam at the target is estimated to be 3.4 x 1015\natoms- cm-2\n-\n\nsec\n\n-1\n1\n\n.\n\nThe measured mean energy per atom for\n\nAr was about 0.064 eV (some 25% higher than that for an\neffusive beam at the source temperature); Xe is expected to\n\n21\n\nFigure 3.1.5\n\nPhotograph of Multichannel Source\n\n22\nhave the same mean energy as Ar since Ref. (24) indicates\nthat, for the source pressures used in the present experiments, the multichannel source is operating in the limit of\nisentropic expansion.\n\nAlthough the angular distribution of\n\nbeam flux was not measured, based on Ref. (25), it is estimated that 75% of the molecules diverged less than +60 from\nthe beam axis.\n\nFor completely free molecular flow through\n\nthe beam defining elements, the maximum beam divergence\nshould not exceed +40.\n\n3.2\n\nTime-of-Flight Detection System\nThe time-of-flight (TOF) detection system was designed\n\nafter that of Haaena, Scott and Varma (2 6\nschematically in Fig. 3.2.1.\n\n)\n\nand is shown\n\nThe system includes a chopper,\n\na detector, and detector signal processing instrumentation.\nThe chopper is a thin 15.2 cm diameter disk with 0.16 cm\nradial slots cut 0.64 cm deep at 900 intervals around its\nperiphery and is driven by a synchronous motor.\n\nFor the\n\nstay-time experiments, the chopper rotational speed is held\nconstant at about 1200 rpm.\n\nDirect beam speed distribuitions\n\nwere determined at a chopper speed of about 3000 rpm to\nobtain reasonable time-of-flight resolution(26) .\n\nAs a slot\n\npasses across the molecular beam,

stay-\n\ntime measurements, the pulse first travels to a target and\nthen to the detector as shown by Position B.\n\nThe signal\n\nfrom the ionization detector, proportional to instantaneous\nnumber density within its active zone, is amplified and then\nfed into a signal averager.\n\nThe averager divides the signal\n\ninto 100 consecutive channels of equal time width and\naverages the signal over many pulses to improve the signalto-noise ratio.\n\nThe averaged signal is then recorded in\n\nanalog and/or digital form.\nThe time evolution of the detector signal depends on\nthe initial shape of the pulse, the speed distribution of\nbeam molecules, the experimental geometry, and for stay-time\nmeasurements, the distribution of molecular stay times on\nthe surface and the speed distribution of molecules leaving\nthe surface.\n\nThe dependence of the signal shape on these\n\nfactors is analyzed in Chapter 4.\n\n3.3\n\nTargets and Temperature Control\nThree targets were employed.\n\nOne was high purity\n\n(99.999%) copper and two were high purity (99.995%) nickel.\n\n25\nEach was 0.64 cm diam x 0.16 cm thick and was mounted on a\ncopper holder as shown in Fig. 3.3.1.\n\nThe copper holder was\n\nattached to a liquid-nitrogen-filled reservoir by means of a\nboron nitride spacer.\n\nThis spacer electrically insulated\n\nthe target (to allow measurement of the ion current during\nion bombardment) and still provided adequate thermal conductance for cooling the target.\n\nA tungsten filament was\n\ninserted inside the holder to allow heating of the target\nand was electrically insulated from the holder by a ceramic\ntube.\n\nA chromel-constantan thermocouple was mounted on the\n\nholder just below the target for measuring the target\ntemperature.\n\nThe output of this thermocouple was recorded\n\non a continuous recording potentiometer and was also used in\na feedback loop to control the voltage across the heater\nfilament and thereby control the target temperature.\n\nWith\n\nthis arrangement, the target temperature could be varied\nfrom 90 K to 450 K and could be maintained constant within\n\n+0.5\xc2\xb0K.\n\n3.4\n\nTarget Preparation\nAll targets were first polished to a mirror finish,\n\nfollowing standard metallurgical practice, finishing with\nNo. 600 diamond paste.\n\nThe Cu target and one Ni target\n\n(hereafter referred to as Ni A) were then cleaned by rinsing\n\n26\n\nLN2\n\nCOPPER LN\n2\nRESERVOIR\n\nBORON NITRIDE\nSPACER\n\nHEATER\nFILAMENT\n\nCOPPER\nHOLDER\n\nTARGET\nCOPPER-CONSTANTAN\nTHERMOCOUPLE\n\nFigure 3.3.1\n\nTarget

removed, and then subjected to a series of cleaning\nsteps known as the "Diversey" process.\n\nAlthough the detailed\n\ncompositions of the cleaning agents used in this process are\nproprietary to the Diversey Company, they consist basically\nof (a) a degreaser, (b) an oxidizer, (c) an oxide remover,\n(d) an etchant and finally (e) a distilled water rinse.\nThis process has been used successfully in other experiments (2 7)\non nickel to remove all but a few atomic layers of oxide\nfrom the surface.\n\nThe Ni B target was then subjected to\n\nvacuum heating and stay-time experiments similar to those\nfor the Cu and Ni A targets.\n\nAfter a number of experiments\n\nwith Ni A, it was removed and cleaned by the Diversey process.\n\nFor clarity, the steps to which each target was\nsubjected are

TO MEAN\nSTAY TIME FOR A FIRST-ORDER DESORPTION PROCESS\n\nThe shape of the detector signal for a distribution of\nstay times corresponding to a first-order desorption process\nis examined in this chapter.\n\nThe effects of finite shutter\n\nopen time and finite molecular transit times from chopperto-target and target-to-detector are included in this\nexamination for the geometry and experimental conditions of\nthe present study.\n\nFor the assumed first-order desorption\n\nprocess, a method is presented for deducing mean stay times\nfrom certain parameters of the detector signal.\n\nThe analy-\n\nsis is a generalization of that presented by Bailey(15) to\ninclude the effects of finite shutter open time and incident\nbeam speed distribution.\n\n4.1\n\nDetector Signal for a Triangular Shutter Function and\nFirst-Order Desorption\nConsider the case of unsteady adsorption followed by\n\ndesorption at a rate proportional to the surface coverage\n(first-order desorption).\n\nThe total rate of change in\n\n31\n\n32\nsurface coverage is then\n\nda\ndo-a\nd\n\na\nOa\n_\n\n- Pa\n\nIf the adsorption rate, given by PaFi(t), is known, then the\nsolution of Eq.

For a given detector signal, all\nexcept 7\nwill be known from other experimental information.\n\nThus, if\n\nthe derived model for S(t) were sufficiently accurate, T\ncould be determined either by some sort of curve fit of the\npredicted function to the measured signal shape or by comparisons of predicted to measured Ats or 7 2 . Of course, the\nassumptions made in deriving this model are only approximations, and some disagreement between measured and predicted\nsignal behavior is expected.\n\nAt least in principle, the\n\nvalidity of these assumptions can be assessed by comparisons\nof the predicted behavior to that observed experimentally.\n\n38\n\n1000 -\n\n100 -\n\n-\n\n-\n\n10\n\n10\n\nFigure 4.2.2\n\n100\n\nPredicted Variation of Peak Shift At\nand Time Constant 72 with Stay Time r,\nts/6 = 14.9, fsx 2/6 = 23.7\n\n1000\n\nCHAPTER 5\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\n\nThe discussion of the experimental program will be\ndivided into two parts,\nexperiments.\n\n(a) calibrations and (b) stay-time\n\nDetector calibration and characterization of\n\nthe molecular beam and TOF detection system are described in\nAppendix II.\n\nThe stay-time measurements and the variables\n\ninvolved are described in Sec. 5.1.\n\nThe techniques for\n\nextracting stay times and related parameters from the\nrecorded detector signals are described in Sec. 5.2.\n\nAn\n\nanalysis of the uncertainties associated with the measurements and the data reduction techniques is given in Sec. 5.3.\n\n5.1\n\nStay-Time Experiments\nThe primary stay-time experiments are listed in Table\n\n5.1.1 along with the experimental conditions for each run.\nThe target designations are those given in Table 3.4.1.

(4.1.6).\nThe value of Ats for this S(t) was determined and compared\nto the experimental value.\n\nIteration on 7 was continued\n\nuntil the calculated and experimental values of At s agreed.\nThe quantities to and fsX 2 used in the above were calcu1\nlated using the measured source and target temperatures,\nrespectively, and the flight lengths x1 and x2 . The effective shutter open time ts was determined from a separate\nseries of measurements in which detector signals were\nrecorded as a function of chopper speed.\n\nIn the limit of\n\nlarge shutter open time (ts>> sx2 and 7), it can be\n\n46\nshown(2 6 ) that the detector signal shape will approach that\nof the shutter function g(t).\n\nFor a triangular shutter\n\nfunction, ts is just the width at half-maximum and should be\nlinearly proportional to the chopper period.\n\nThe observed\n\nvariation of the detector signal width at JS(t m ) was also\nfound to be linear with chopper period at slow chopper\nspeeds.\n\nThus, this variation was used to estimate the\n\neffective open time at higher chopper speeds of the triangular shutter function used in the stay-time estimations.\nBinding Energy and Preexponential Factor.\n\nIf the stay\n\ntime obeyed a Frenkel-type relation and if the first-order\ndetector signal model were perfectly accurate, then the\nmeasured dependence of the above determined 7 with Ts could\nbe used to obtain the binding energy Eo and preexponential\nfactor To .\n\nHowever, as will be seen in Chapter 6, disagree-\n\nment between measured and predicted detector signals gave\nreason to question some of the model assumptions.\n\nAs a\n\nresult of this disagreement, the stay times calculated from\nthe peak shifts are considerably in error at the lower surface temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative behavior of\n\nthe factors Eo and ro was determined directly from the peak\nshift data assuming\n\nAts = ro exp(Eo/kTs)\n\n(5.2.3)\n\nThe parameters, Eo and To, were estimated for each data set\nby the following procedures,\n(1) Direct curve-fit of Eq. (5.2.3) to peak shift\ndatai\n(2) Calculate Eo for each data point based on\nmobile-adsorption prediction, Eq. (2.1.11),\nassuming 7 = At s\n(3) Calculate Eo for each data point based on\nlocalized-adsorption prediction, Eq.

(28) and (29) respectively.\n\n5.3\n\nUncertainty Analysis\n\nUncertainties in the results are concerned mainly with\nthe following quantities. First are the uncertainties in\nthe experimental parameters, particularly the surface temperature. Second are the uncertainties in stay-time parameters\ndeduced directly from the recorded detector signales these\nerrors are introduced both by the actual measurement process\nand the associated data reduction techniques. Next are the\nundertainties in stay times, binding energies and preexponential factors that are derived from the measured stay-time\nparameters and experimental parameters.\n\nThese latter errors\n\n48\ndepend on the parameter uncertainties but are expected to be\nmainly due to approximations in the detector-signal model\nand adsorption model employed in deducing said quantities.\nFinally are uncertainties in the nature of the surface which\nmake data interpretation more difficult.\nUncertainties in experimental conditions.\n\nThe primary\n\nexperimental variable which affects the stay time is the\ntarget temperature.\n\nSystematic error in reported values of\n\nthe absolute target temperature is less than 3 K (based on\ncalibration of the target thermocouple at the boiling point\nof liquid nitrogen).\n\nHowever, from the reproducibility of\n\nthe indicated temperature at different constant heat inputs,\nerrors in temperature differences are estimated to be less\nthan +0.50K.\n\nTarget temperature fluctuations during the\n\n0\naveraging of a given detector signal were typically +0.5 K.\n\nOther parameter uncertainties which affect the detector\nsignal are listed in Table 5.1.2.\nUncertainties in measured stay-time parameters.\n\nErrors\n\nin Ats and 7 2 result due to timing errors in the signal\nmeasurement and due to extraction of these parameters from\nthe recorded signals.\n\nThe time response of the detector and\n\nits signal processing instrumentation was determined from\ntime-of-flight measurements with a single-orifice molecular\nbeam source (see Appendix II).\n\nBased on these measurements,\n\n49\ntiming errors due to signal shape distortion by the detection\nsystem are estimated to be less than 10 - 5 sec.\n\nThe accuracy\n\nof the data reduction for At s and 7 2 depends primarily on\nthe signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the recorded signal.\nSince the S/N generally decreased with decreasing temperature, the absolute uncertainty in these parameters is larger\nat the lower temperatures.\n\nThe uncertainty in determining\n\ntm for a given recorded signal varied typically from about\n\xc2\xb110\n\n-5\n\nto ti0\n\n-4\n\nsec (or \xc2\xb13 to \xc2\xb16% of measured tm).\n\nBased\n\nstrictly on the observed linearity (and deviations from\nlinearity) of tm with 1/ fs at temperatures where 7-was negligible, the uncertainty in predicting tm,r=o at lower\ntemperatures by Eq. (5.2.1) was about \xc2\xb110\nmeasured tm,=o).\n\n-5\n\nsec (or \xc2\xb12% of\n\nThese uncertainties in tm and tm,r= o rep-\n\nresent the limits of 95% confidence in the data reduction\ntechniques employed.\n\nThe resulting uncertainties in the data\n\nreduction for the peak shift, estimated from the rms sum of\nthe above, varied from about \xc2\xb12 x 10 - 5 to\n\n10 - 4 sec.\n\nThe 95%\n\nconfidence limits in determining 72 were more sensitive to\n\nthe S/N ratio and varied from about t4 x 10-5 sec at the\nhigher temperatures to about \xc2\xb110 - 3 sec at the lowest temperatures for these experiments (corresponding to \xc2\xb110 to \xc2\xb125%\nof measured T 2 ).\nUncertainties in r, E o and T o .\n\nThe accuracy of the\n\nstay time estimated from At s is primarily dependent on the\n\n50\nvalidity of the detector-signal model.\n\nThe approximations\n\nemployed for the incident and desorbed beam speed distributions are expected to be sufficiently accurate for determining\nT in this way.\n\nThe accuracy of the triangular shutter func-\n\ntion approximation and the validity of the first-order\ndesorption model will be discussed in the next chapter.\nGeometrical effects not considered in the model, such as the\nfinite size of the target and detector aperture, are estimated to have negligible effect on the signal shape and thus\nnegligible effect on r.\nThe uncertainties in the parameters, 7T\n\nand Eo, are\n\ndependent on the validity of the adsorption model and will\nbe discussed in Chapter 6 along with those results.\nUncertainties in surface conditions.\n\nThe composition\n\nand physical structure of the surfaces of the various targets is subject to considerable uncertainty. The coverage\ndue to gases (other than the beam species) adsorbing from\nthe test chamber background was probably significant particularly at the lower temperatures. Nevertheless, the\nreproducibility of these conditions is verified to some\nextent at least by the reproducibility of the experimental\nresults presented in Chapter 6.\n\nCHAPTER 6\nRESULTS\n\n6.1\n\nComparison Between Measured and Predicted Detector\nSignal Shapes\nThree typical recorded detector signals are shown in\n\nFig. 6.1.1.\n\nFor part (a) of this figure, the detector sig-\n\nnal was recorded with the target at room temperature where\nthe stay time should be very small.\n\nThe signal shape pre-\n\ndicted by Eq. (4.1.6) for 7= 0 is shown here for comparison.\nThe agreement between measured and predicted signals is\ngood\nup to t~ztm, but for t >tm, the measured signal decays\nat a\nrate smaller than predicted. The disagreement at\nlarge\ntimes may be due i* large part to errors in the\napproximate\nshutter function used in generating the theoretical\ncurve.\nThe assumed shutter function is symmetric about\nits midpoint.\nCalculations by Olander(30) indicate that the symmetry\nof\nthe angular flux distribution and therefore the\nsymmetry of\nthe shutter function are sensitive to source-collimator\nalignment.\n\nSome additional calculations of signal shapes\nwere performed using an asymmetrical triangular\nshutter\nfunction.\n\nBy varying the degree of\n\nasymmetry in this func-\n\ntion, a shutter function was found which predicted\nthe\nmeasured signal shape up to tzut .

is that expected.\n\nThus,\n\nto first approximation, the disagreement between theory and\nexperiment at large t should introduce negligible error in\nthe determination of - from peak-shift data.\n\nOf course,\n\nestimation of - from the observed decay rate of the signal\nat large t (i.e., t = t2 ) will be affected.\n\nEven so, as 7\n\nbecomes large compared to the discrepancy in time, the error\nintroduced in 7 2 will approach zero.\nA second typical signal, measured at a target temperature where the peak shift is finite due to stay time, is\nshown in Fig. 6.1.1(b).\n\nAlso shown here are the predicted\n\nsignal for 7 = 0 and the predicted signal for that value of\n7\n\nwhich fits the measured signal at tm\n\n.\n\nTo first order, the\n\npredicted (7 d 0) curve is delayed approximately by 7 up to\nt st m\n\n,\n\nbut beyond tm the time delay becomes increasingly\n\n56\ngreater.\n\nThe predicted (rT I 0) curve agrees with the measured\n\ncurve up to t stm\n\n.\n\nHowever, for t >tm , the measured curve\n\ndecays at a lower rate than the predicted (7 jV 0) curve.\nThis discrepancy at large t is similar to that observed at\nroom temperature for negligible stay time.\nAt even lower target temperatures (larger stay times)\nthe measured detector signals take on a shape that was altogether unexpected.\nFig. 6.1.1(c).\n\nAn example of this shape is shown in\n\nIt is seen that the signal exhibits a "nega-\n\ntive" dip at small times.\n\nTo understand a negative signal,\n\nit must be recalled that the detector\'s ion-collector current includes a component due to background.gas in the\nchamber as well as a component due to the pulsed molecular\nbeam.\n\nDuring detector signal processing, only the rela-\n\ntively fast,time-varying components are amplified.\n\nThat is,\n\nthe low-frequency (below about 10 Ha) components are intentionally filtered out.\n\nMoreover, signal averaging eliminates\n\nany background fluctuation which does not occur repetitively\nat the chopper frequency.\n\nThus, under normal conditions,\n\nthe background component does not appear in the recorded\nsignal.\n\nHowever, the background gas is composed, in large\n\npart, of the same gas as in the beam and is steadily adsorbing and desorbing along with the beam pulses.\n\nSince it is\n\nimpossible for the beam pulses to give rise to the negative\ndips, it is most likely that the beam pulse in some way\n\n57\ntemporarily reduces the rate of desorption of background\nmolecules from the target.\nSignals exhibiting the negative dip obviously cannot be\ndescribed by the detector-signal model for first-order desorpStill, it was observed that both At s and 72 for this\n\ntion.\n\ntype of signal increased with decreasing surface temperature\nin a reproducible manner for a given data run.\nthe signal at long times (t-t\n\n2\n\nIn addition,\n\n) seems to decay exponentially\n\nas for a first-order process at least to the extent that can\nbe determined by curve-fit techniques.\n\nThus, At s and 72\n\nappear to be indicative of at least the qualitative behavior\nof the stay time even for this type of signal.\n\nThe behavior\n\nof signals exhibiting the negative dip is discussed further\n\nin Sec. 6.5.\n\n6.2\n\nStay-Time Parameters\nStay-time parameters At s and 7 2 deduced from the set of\n\ndetector signals from which the ones in Fig. 6.1.1 were\ntaken are shown in Fig. 6.2.1.\nderived from the At\nChapter 5.\n\nAlso shown are values of 7\n\ndata using proceduresdescribed in\n\nThe error flags shown represent the limits of\n\n95% confidence for determining At s and 72 from the recorded\nsignals by the data reduction techniques described in Chapter 5.\n\n(Note that the scatter in the plotted data generally\n\nfalls well within these limits.)\n\nIf the stay time varied as\n\n58\n\n/\n\n10-2\n\n4/\n10 -

For At< 10-k sec, this is the\n-4\ncase. However, for At > 10- sec, 7- derived from Ats shows\na rapid increase as Tsi increases and eventually exceeds\n72.\nSince in theory one expects -2/721, these - values are\nclearly too high at large T\n\n1.\n\nThe linearity of InAt s with T;1 noted here was also\nobserved in all other experimental data.\n\nAt small r, the\n\nslope of InAts must be the slope of lnr with Ts1 .\n7,\n\nAt large\n\nthe T2 data indicate that the actual stay time is no more\n\nthan a factor of 4 greater than Ats . Thus, it seems that\nthe At s data are better representations of the variation of\nthe actual stay time over the temperature range than one\nshould expect.\n\nFor this reason, only the peak-shift (At )\n\ndata will be considered in the following presentation of the\neffects of other parameter variations.\n\nHowever, 7r and T\n2\n\ndata comparable to those shown here have been determined for\neach recorded signal and are tabulated in Appendix IV.\n\n60\n6.3\n6.3.1\n\nResults of Parameter Variations\nEffect of Target Material for Xe Adsorption\nPeak shift data for Xe adsorption on Cu and NiA are\n\nplotted in Fig. 6.3.1.\n\nIt is seen that the peak shifts\n\nobtained with NiA are about twice those for Cu at any given\nTs .\n\nSince both targets are probably covered to some extent\n\nby other physisorbed or chemisorbed species, the differences\nmay be due as much to differences in adsorbates as to differences in the target bulk material.\n\nAt least one other run\n\nfor each target reproduced the data shown within approximately the symbol size shown in this figure.\n\nThus, the\n\nobserved peak shift differences are outside the repeatability\nof the data.\n\n6.3.2\n\nEffect of Pre-Vacuum Surface Preparation for Xe\nAdsorption\nThe effects of the previously described pre-vacuum sur-\n\nface preparations for the nickel samples are illustrated in\nFig. 6.3.2.\n\nThe variation of At s with T\n\nXe-.NiB+D are almost identical.\n\ni\n\nfor Xe-NiA and\nforXeNA and\n\nThe best-fit line for\n\nXe-.NiA+D data intersects the best-fit lines for the other\ndata but has a larger slope.\n\nThis may be related to the\n\nknown roughening of the NiA surface by the etchant in the\n\n61\n\n10-2\n\n0 Xe-.Cu\n\n- Xe-NiA\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10-51\n\n.80\n\n.84\n\n.88\n\n.92\n1/Ts,\n\nFigure 6.3.1\n\n-.96\n\n1.00\n\n1.04\n\n1.08 x 10 -

Ar is much less than\nbetween Xe - Ni, a coverage of 0.1 monolayers of Ar might at\n\n67\nmost give rise to a 10% decrease in binding energy for Xe.\nBecause of the exponential dependence of T on Eo , a 10%\ndecrease in E o can easily result in a factor of 10 decrease\nin 7.\n\nThus, the observed effect of ion bombardment could\n\neasily be attributed to ion burial near the surface.\n\n6.3.4\n\nEffect of Ion Bombarding Species for Xe Adsorption\nFollowing Ar bombardment, the NiA+D target was bom-\n\nbarded with He and then Xe ions.\n\nIn Fig. 6.3.4, peak shift\n\ndata measured during ion bombardment with each species are\ncompared to those observed prior to ion bombardment.\n\nHe and\n\nAr ions are seen to produce comparable reductions in the\npeak shift, while Xe ions produce an even further decrease.\nIt was observed that,after the ion beam was shut off\n\nand with Ts fixed, the peak shift would increase with time.\nThe rate at which this increase occurred was quite lowl even\nafter several days, the peak shift would not return com,\npletely to its value prior to ion bombardment.\n\nThis\n\nindicates that a relatively permanent change in the surface\noccurred during ion bombardment.\n\nThus, the chronological\n\norder of the tests could be very important.\n\nTime dependenoe\n\nof the measured stay time under various experimental conditions is discussed further in Sec. 6.3.7.\n\n68\n\n10o2\n\nO Xe Ni A + D\nOXe -Nt\nA +D+He +\nOXe AXe -Ni\n\nNi A + D + Ar +\nA + D + Xe\n\n0\n-3\n\n10\n\nAtS,\n\nsec\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n10-5\n\n.80\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n.84\n\n.88\n\n.92\n/Ts\n\nFigure 6.3.4\n\n.96\n\n1.00\n\n1.04\n\nI\n1.08 x 10-2\n\noK-1\n0\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with Target\nTemperature for Different Ion\nBombarding Species, Ni A+D Target\n\n69\n6.3.5\n\nEffect of Incident Flux Variation for Xe Adsorption\nThe effect on the peak shift of varying the incident\n\nflux, accomplished by varying the source pressure (flux\nproportional to /po(25)), is shown in Fig. 6.3.5.\n\nThe peak\n\nshift is seen to increase by about 50% between p0 = 1 torr\nand po = 3 torr and to reach a broad maximum near po = 6 torr.\nIn the absence of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, 7\nbe independent of p o.\n\nshould\n\nHowever, the appearance of the pre-\n\nviously noted negative dip in the detector signal indicates\nthat such interactions are occurring.\n\nAn estimate of the\n\ntotal surface coverage of Xe from both the beam and background was made using the incident flux of 3.4 x 101 5\natoms .cm\n\n2\n\n.sec\n\n1\n\ngiven in Chapter 3 for po = 10 torr and\n\nthe stay time estimated from the peak-shift data in\nFig. 6.3.5.\n\nThe value obtained for this coverage was about\n\n5 x 1011 atoms\n\ncm - 2 or about 10- 3 monolayers of Xe.\n\nSuch\n\nlow coverage would not be expected to give significant\nXe - Xe interaction.\n\nOf course, adsorbate-adsorbate inter-\n\nactions may have occurred between Xe and some other species\nadsorbed from the background, but again due to the low\ncoverage of Xe, the peak shift should be independent of po.\nThus, in the absence of additional information about the\nstate of the surface, the observed dependence of - on p\n0\ncannot be interpreted.\n\n70\n\n2.4\n\n10-4\n\n2.0\n\n1.6\nAts , sec\n1.2\n\n.8\n\nXe ---- Ni A + D\n.4\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\nI\n4\nPo,\n\nFigure 6.3.5\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\ntorr\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with\nSource Pressure, Xe -Ni A+D,\nT = 111 0 K\n\n71\n6.3.6\n\nStay Times for CO2 and Kr Adsorption\n\nPeak shift data for CO2 and Kr adsorbing on NiA are\ncompared to those obtained for Xe in Fig. 6.3.6.\n\nThe peak\n\nshifts for CO2 are comparable in magnitude to those for Xe\nbut exhibit a smaller slope versus T1.\n\nThe temperatures at\n\nwhich Kr shows comparable stay times are about 20% lower\nthan those for Xe.\n\nThis would be expected on the basis of\n\nknown differences in atom-atom attractive well depths for Xe\nand Kr 3\nC0(2\n\n.\n\nWhile the molecule-molecule well depth for\n\nfalls between those for Xe and Kr, it is not sur-\n\nprising that stay times for a polyatomic gas do not scale\nexactly with this well-depth.\n\n6.3.7\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with Time\nBailey (1 5 ) observed that after cooling his surface to\n\na given temperature, the stay time decreased with elapsed\ntime.\n\nThis decrease was attributed to the adsorption of\n\ngases present in his chamber.\n\nSince the present vacuum\n\nsystem and pressures are similar to those in Bailey\'s work,\nthe time dependence of the peak shift was investigated in\nthis work also.\nFirst, the peak shift was measured as a function of\ntime both with and without simultaneous ion bombardment.\nThese data are shown in Fig. 6.3.7.\n\nAlso shown in this\n\n72\n\n10-2\n\nO Xe-Ni\n0 CO2-\n\nO\n\nKr -Ni\n\nA+ D\nNi A + D\nA+ D\n\no\n\nsec\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n.80\n\n.84\n\n.88\n\n.92\n\n.96\n\n1.00\n\n1.04\n\n0\n\n1/Ts\', oK-1\n\nFigure 6.3.6\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with Target\nTemperature for Different Incident\nGas Species, Ni A+D Target\n\n1.08 x 10-2\n\n73\n\n400-\n\no-\n\n360\n\nO\n320\n\nAccummulated ion\ndose at time = 0\n\nIon current\nduring run\n\n280 O\n[\n240 -\n\nA\n\nisec\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n-9\nA\n4x10\n3x10 "9 A\n2x10\n\n9\n\n2 x 10-6 C\n5x10-\n\nA\n\n6\n\nC\n\n200\n\n160\n\n120\n\n80\n\nO\n\n40 -\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\nTime , min\n\nFigure 6.3.7\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with Time\nDuring Argon Ion Bombardment for\n\nDifferent Initial Ion Dosages,\n\nXe-wNi A+D, Ts = 108 0 K\n\n40\n\n74\nfigure are data obtained for different accumulated ion doses\n\nat time = 0.\n\n(The rate prior to t = 0 for these data was\n\nthat shown for t >0.\n\nThis accumulated dose is the total\n\ncharge due to ions received by the sample immediately prior\nto recording the datal it is not the total dose the target\nhas received since initial installation.)\n\nFor no ion bombardment during the recording of the peak\nshift data (circles), the peak shift shows a gradual\nincrease with time.\n\nThe target received an accumulated dose\n\nof about 5 x io-6C on the day previous to this run, and this\nincrease with time is similar to that noted in Sec. 6.3.4\nupon cessation of ion bombardment.\n\nHowever, similar\n\nincreases in At. with time were observed for targets having\nreceived no previous ion bombardment.\nFor ion bombardment beginning at t = 0 (squares), the\npeak shift first decreases sharply with time, levels off,\nreaches a second maximum and decreases toward some asymptotic\nlimit.\n\nThe sharp initial decrease is probably due to a\n\nlarger ion gun current known to occur during the first\nfew\nminutes of operation. For an initial ion dose of\n2 x 10"6\n\nC\n\n(diamonds), At s shows a gradual decrease with time,leveling\noff after about 26 minutes. After an initial dose\nof about\n5 x 10- 6C at t = 0 (triangles), At s remains essentially\nconstant.\n\nAssuming the previously discussed ion-burial\ntheory is correct, the data in this figure suggest\nthat\n\nthe\n\n75\nsurface becomes saturated after an ion dose of about\n5 x 10 - 6 C and that bombardment at a rate of 2 x 10- 9 A can\nmaintain saturation.\nTime variations of the peak shift following cessation\nof ion bombardment are shown in Fig. 6.3.8.\n\nFor each set of\n\ndata, the ion dose prior to time zero was at least 5 x 10- 6 C\nand ion bombardment was stopped at time zero.\n\nFor Fig.\n\n6.3.8(a), the sample was exposed only to the residual background gas.\n\nThe background was at a pressure of 3 to 4 x\n\n10 - 7 torr and consisted mostly of Xe from the molecular\nbeam.\n\nOther gases, primarily N2 , 02, H 2 0 and CO 2 , as deter-\n\nmined by a mass spectrometer, contributed a partial\npressure of about 2 x 10- 8 torr.\n\nThe effect of this expo-\n\nsure is seen to be a gradual increase in the peak shift with\ntime which continued to very long times.\n\nFor the data in\n\nFig. 6.3.8(b)-(d), the partial pressures of CO2\n\n,\n\nH 2 0, and Xe\n\nin turn were intentionally increased during the measurement\nsequence.\n\nFor comparison, the data from Fig. 6.3.8(a) are\n\nshown as a solid line in these latter figures.\n\nIf the\n\nincrease in peak shift with time was due to adsorption of\nthese gases, an increase in the partial pressure of these\ngases should alter the rate at which At s increased.\nCO 2 and H 2 0 show a possible effect.\n\nBoth\n\nAfter about 20 minutes\n\nexposure to CO 2 , the rate at which At s is increasing\nseems to increase (based only on the last data point).\n\n280\n\n240 -\n\n200 -\n\n160 -\n\nAs \'\n\nsec\n120 -\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\nTime , min\n\n(a)\n\nBackground only, pXe\n\nFigure 6.3.8\n\nf\n\n3 x 10\n\n- 7\n\ntorr,\n\nother\n\n=\n\n2 x 10\n\n- 8\n\ntorr\n\nVariation of Peak Shift with Time after Ion Bombardment\n\nfor Different Background Pressures and Species,\n\nXe-*Ni A+D, T s = 108 0 K\n\n132\n\n280\n\n240\n\nO\n0\n-8\npCo2< 2x10\n\nPCO2= lx 10\n\ntorr\n\n-\n\ntorr\n\n200-\n\n0\nO\n\n160o\nAts,\n\nIsec\n\nO\n120\nO\n0\n\n0\n\n80\n\n40\n40\n\n.0\n\n-\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\nTime,\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6.3.8\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\nmin\n\nEffect of increasing pCO\n\ncontinued (Solid curve is from part (a)\nof this figure.)\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\n280\n\n240\n\nPH20 < 2 x 10 - 8 torr\n\nPH20 = 1.5 x10 - 7 torr\n\n200 -\n\n160\nAt s , j sec\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\n120 -\n\nO\n\n0\n80\n\n40 -\n\n0 C)Ii\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\nTime , min\n\n(c)\nFigure 6.3.8\n\nEffect of increasing PH 2 0\n\ncontinued (Solid curve is from part (a)\nof this figure.)\nOD\n\n280\n\n240 -PXe\n\n3.5 x 10\n\n=\n\n-7\n\npXe\n\ntorr\n\n= 1.1x10 - 6 torr\n\n200\n\n160\nAts,\n\nsec\n1208\n\n4\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\nTime,\n\n(d)\nFigure 6.3.8\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\n48\n\n52\n\n56\n\nmin\n\nEffect of increasing pXe\n\nconcluded (Solid curve is from part (a)\nof this figure.)\n%0\n\n80\n\nAfter about 20 minutes exposure to H2 0, the peak shift\nbegins to level off with further exposure time.\n\nOn the\n\nother hand, additional Xe exposure, even at much higher\npressures, shows no significant change in the rate of At s increase.\n\nThus, while CO2 and H20 adsorption may contribute\n\nto this change in Ats with time, it seems that some other\nfactor is the driving force.\n\nIt may be adsorption of some\n\nother species in the chamber or possibly the slow release\nof buried argon from the surface.\n\n6.4\n\nBinding Energy Results\nThe slopes and intercepts, Eo and 7 o , obtained by a\n\nleast-squares fit of Eq.

previously shown decrease in stay\n\ntimes by a factor of 10 to 100 due to ion bombardment is\nassociated with a decrease in E/k of only about 7%.\n\nSimi-\n\nlarly, the results for Kr on Ni indicate a binding energy\nsome 20% lower than that for Xe or CO2 on Ni even though at\ncomparable Ts, the stay times might differ by a factor of\n1000.\n\nAlso, a binding energy for CO02 on Ni lower than that\n\nfor Xe and a higher r for CO2 than that for Xe are consiso\ntent with the qualitative behavior in Fig. 6.3.6 where the\npeak shift data were comparable in magnitude for the two\ngases.\n\n6.5\n\nThe Negative Dips in the Detector Signal\nThe negative dip in the detector signal was discussed\n\nbriefly in Sec. 6.1.\n\nFor this dip to occur, the background\n\ncomponent of the detector signal must decrease temporarily\nthrough some interaction with the beam pulse.\n\nIt was stated\n\nearlier that this interaction most likely occurred between\nmolecules adsorbed on the surface.\n\nTo support this state-\n\nment, the probability of a number of other possible\ninteractions must be considered.\n\nFirst, it can be stated\n\nthat the geometry of the apparatus was such that\n\n85\ninteractions between beam and background molecules passing\nthrough the chopper slots and from there directly into the\ndetector did not contribute to this dip.\n\nThis was verified\n\nin separate experiments in which an additional aperture was\nplaced in front of the detector such that no direct line of\nsight existed between the chopper slots and the detector\nionization zone.\n\nSecond, collisions between beam and back-\n\nground molecules in the regions between the chopper, target\nand detector should be negligible.\n\nThe mean free path of\n\nbackground molecules through gas at the density of the beam\npulse is estimated to be at least 300 cm, much greater than\nthe flight path lengths involved.\n\nFinally, the duration\n\ntime between pulses was such that no anomalies due to pulse\noverlap should have occurred.\n\nFor example, if the 72 data\n\nare a valid upper limit for the mean stay time for this\ntype of signal, it is estimated that no greater than 5% of\nthe molecules from the preceding beam pulse remained on the\nsurface at the beginning of a new pulse even at the largest\n72 encountered in these experiments.\n\nThus, barring some\n\nunforeseen behavior, it seems that the beam-background\ninteraction did occur most likely on the target surface.\nTo estimate the effects of these dips on the data\nreduction, an empirical model was developed.\n\nIt was\n\nobserved that the position of the "minimum" occurred near\nthe position of the expected maximum for the detector signal\n\n86\nfor zero stay time.\n\nThis suggested that the observed signal\n\nmight be modeled by the following superposition of two\nsignals:\n\nS(t,7,K) = S(t,7) - KS(t,O)\n\nwhere K is an adjustable constant.\n\n(6.5.1)\n\nThe function S(t,7)\n\nrepresents the contribution to the detector signal from the\ndesorbing molecular beam pulse.\n\nThe term, -KS(t,O), repre-\n\nsents the decrease in the contribution to the detector\nsignal from the background gas.\n\nFor given 7, temperature,\n\nand gas species, the functions S(t,7) and S(t,O) were\nassumed to be given by Eq. (4.1.6).\n\nThe combination of -\n\nand K was found which gave the best fit to both the measured\npeak shift and the ratio of the positive to negative detector signal amplitudes Sma/Sminl .\n\nTwo typical comparisons\n\nof measured to modeled signals are shown in Fig. 6.5.1.\nthe first example, Fig.\n\n6 .5.1(a),\n\nIn\n\nthe agreement is excellent\n\nfor t >t,, but the model\'s minimum occurs at a later time.\nIn Fig. 6.5.1(b), the predicted and measured minimum position are in slightly better agreement, but clearly the model\ncannot account for the observed exponential-like rise in the\nnegative portion of the signal.\n\nSignals of the shape shown\n\nin Fig. 6.5.1(b) imply that the stay times are logg compared\nto the measurement times and therefore only the background\n\n.8-\n\n.6\n\n.4\n2\n.2-\n\n\'\n\nCalculated using K = 1.2\n1 3x10\n\nS1T=\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n-3\n\nsec\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nt , sec\n\n-. 4\n\n-. 6\n\n(a)\nFigure 6.5.1\n\nXe-*Ni A, T8\ns\n\n108oK\n\nComparison of Empirical Model Predictions with\n\nTypical Detector Signals Showing Negative Dip\n\n22\n\n24 x 10-4\n\n0.2\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n\n-1.0\n\n(b)\n\nXe-eCu,\n\nFigure 6.5.1\n\nT s = 920 K\n\nconcluded\nOD\nOD\n\n89\ndip is observable in the signal.\n\nThe majority of the\n\nrecorded signals showing the negative dip were of the general\nshape shown in Fig. 6.5.1(a).\n\nThe appearance of this type\n\nof signal depended on the magnitude of the stay time.\n\nIt\n\ndid not appear for peak shifts less than 10-4 sec for any of\nthe test gases.\nFor one set of detector signals, values of - were\ndeduced using Eq. (6.5.1) for those signals showing the dip.\nThe result of these calculations is shown in Fig. 6.5.2.\n\nIt\n\nis seen that 7 deduced in this manner shows better agreement\nwith T2 than the values given in Fig. 6.1.2.\n\nThe new analy-\n\nsis seems still to overpredict the stay time at large 7\nwhere 72 should be a reasonable upper limit for T.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis overprediction is not as great as that shown previously\nin Sec. 6.2.\nObviously, the empirical model gives little insight into\nthe physical mechanisms behind the observed behavior.\n\nIt\n\nseems that dips are indeed due to temporary reduction in the\nbackground-component desorption rate caused by the beam\npulse.\n\nSuch a reduction indicates that the effective bind-\n\ning energy increases with coverage.\n\nThe fact that the\n\nmagnitude of the dip minimum was observed to increase with\ndecreasing temperature (increasing coverage) also supports\nthis conclusion.\n\nSuch an increase in binding energy has\n\nbeen observed by Baker and Fox\n\nfor xenon on nickel.\n\n90\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10 - 3\n\n/\n\nIU\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nAt s , Measured\n--\n\n7\n\n7-2\n\nI\n\n10.80\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.84\n\n.88\n\n.92\n\n.96\n\n1/Ts,\n\nFigure 6.5.2\n\n,\n\nCorrected using empirical\nmodel for negative dip\nMeasured\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1.00\n\n1.04\n\n1.08 x 10-2\n\nOK-1\n\nExample of Stay Time Obtained from\nPeak Shift Based on Empirical Model\nfor Negative Dip, Xe-*Ni A\n\n91\nHowever, since the maximum coverage of beam gas species\n(beam pulse plus background component) is estimated to be a\nsmall fraction of a monolayer, it is difficult to see how\ninteractions between beam-species atoms lead to the observed\ndip.\n\nOf course, there is a high probability that a signifi-\n\ncant coverage of other background species exists in this\ntemperature.\n\nSuffice it to say that, in the absence of\n\nsupporting information concerning the surface conditions,\nthis behavior cannot be completely explained.\n\n92\nCHAPTER 7\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIt has been demonstrated that a molecular-beam time-offlight approach is potentially powerful for the study of\nphysical adsorption under non-equilibrium conditions.\n\nOnly\n\nunder non-equilibrium conditions can information about\nadsorption and desorption rates and probabilities be obtained.\nIn particular, it has been shown that a mean stay time for\nmolecules on the surface is a measurable quantity.\n\nIt has\n\nalso been observed that pronounced effects on the desorption\npulse can occur due to what are apparently adsorbateadsorbate interactions.\nA model for the detected time-of-flight signal behavior\nhas been developed assuming a first-order desorption process.\nThis model predicts that, for a mean stay time - comparable\nto or less than the mean transit times for the experiment,\nthe detected signal is delayed by an amount approximately\nequal to this stay time.\n\nTherefore, the stay time can be\n\nestimated from the shift in the signal peak.\n\nFor stay times\n\nmuch greater than these transit times, the model predicts\nthat the signal decays as exp(-t/7) and - can be estimated\nfrom this decay rate.\n\nFor intermediate values of 7, no\n\nsimple relationship between signal shape and - exists.\nshutter open time ts has been shown to have negligible\n\nThe\n\n93\neffect on the peak shift due to stay time, but unless 7>>t s\n,\nit may have significant effect on the decay rate.\nFrom the experimental data, mean stay times have been\nestimated for the adsorption of Xe, Kr and CO2 on copper\nand nickel surfaces as a function of surface temperature.\nThe minimum detectable stay time for these experiments was\nfound to be about 10- 5 sec.\n\nFor 7 between 10- 5 sec and 10-4\n\nsec, - was estimated from the measured peak shift.\n\nHowever,\n\nfor r>10 -4 sec, interpretation of the peak shift in terms\nof the stay time becomes progressively less certain primarily because of a peculiar negative dip in the detector\nsignals which is attributed to adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.\nThe mean stay time has been found to be relatively\nindependent of the surface materials and of the pre-vacuum\nsurface preparations used in these experiments.\nbe due to\n\nThis could\n\nobscuring of the bulk material by a layer of\n\nphysisorbed gases reaching the surface through the background gas as well as chemisorbed gases present prior to the\n\nexperiments.\nIon bombardment of the nickel surface during Xe adsorption has been found to reduce the mean stay time at fixed Ts. Xe\nbombardment reduced the stay time typically by a factor of\nabout 100 while Ar and He ion bombardment each reduced the\nstay time typically by a\n\nfactor of 10.\n\nIt is proposed that\n\n94\nthis reduction results from burial of the neutralized ions\nnear the surface.\n\nFor argon ion bombardment, ion doses\n\ncorresponding to about 0.1 monolayers were sufficient to\nstabilize the stay time at its reduced value.\nExperiments were performed for Xe on Ni at fixed surface temperatures over a range of incident beam flux by\nvarying the molecular beam source pressure.\n\nAt the highest\n\nsource pressure employed, the measured stay time and calculated beam flux indicate a surface coverage of about 10-3\nmonolayers.\n\nDecreasing the pressure to where the flux was\n\nhalved had little effect on the stay time.\n\nHowever, reducing\n\nthe pressure by a factor of 10 (flux by factor of 3) caused\nthe stay time to decrease substantially.\nThe stay time for CO2 on nickel was found to be comparable to that for Xe at the same surface temperature.\n\nStay\n\ntimes of about the same magnitude were found for Kr on\nnickel only at temperatures about 20% lower.\nThe measured variation of the peak shift At s with surface temperature was used to estimate adsorption binding\nenergy and preexponential factors by fitting these data to a\nFrenkel-type relation, At = 7T\n\nexp(Eo/kTs).\n\nHowever,\n\nsystematic uncertainty and scatter in the peak-shift data\nare such that values of To and Eo determined by direct\ncurve-fit to this relation show large uncertainties.\nTheoretical estimates of 7 O based on a localized adsorption\n\n95\nmodel were found to be in reasonable agreement with the\nvalues found by fitting.\n\nThese values of 7 o are quite low\n\n(~10 -17 sec) and are not representative of typical vibrational periods for adsorbed atoms.\n\nBecause of the high\n\nuncertainty in the fitted 7o and E 0 /k values, the localized\n\nadsorption model estimates for T o were used to obtain more\nreliable estimates of the relative values of E /k from the\npeak-shift data.\n\nThe Eo/k value for Xe on nickel was thus\n\nfound to be about 3250 K with a reduction to about 28500K\nupon ion bombardment with Xe.\n\nFor CO2 and Kr on nickel, the\n\nvalues of E /k were 31000K and 2600 0 K, respectively.\nComparisons of measured signal shapes to those predicted\nby a first-order desorption model show reasonably good agreement at small stay times (low coverage).\n\nThe measured\n\nsignal peak shifts at small stay times behaved with surface\ntemperature as expected.\n\nSignificant disagreement between\n\nmeasured and predicted decay rates at long detector times\nhad little effect on the peak shift behavior and were attributable to shutter function approximations in the model.\n\nAt\n\nthe longer stay times encountered in these experiments, the\nadsorbate-adsorbate interactions, proposed to account for\nsignals exhibiting the negative dip,obviously violate the\nassumption of first-order desorption.\n\nStill, at long mea-\n\nsurement times in the detector signal, the signal decay rate\nwas indicative of first-order desorption.\n\n96\n\nBy far the most serious shortcoming of the present\nexperiments is the uncertainty with regard to the nature of\nthe surfaces.\n\nThe relatively high partial pressures\n\n(it2 x 10- 8 torr) in the test chamber of species other than\nthat in the molecular beam could have led to significant\nadsorption of these species.\n\nThe presence of such adsor-\n\nbates may well be the cause for the unexpected negative dips\nseen in the detected desorption signals.\n\nUncertainty in the\n\nconstancy and nature of the surface conditions also makes\nthe interpretation of the effects of parameter variations\ncorrespondingly uncertain.\nTo improve on these experiments, the following recommendations are offered:\n(1) employ an ultra-high-vacuum test chamber\ncapable of attaining residual pressures of\nabout 10 - 1 0 torr (with sufficient pumping\ncapacity to keep the pressure below about\n106 torr with the molecular beam on)t\n(2) use single crystal targets;\n(3) use in-situ cleaning techniques that allow\nthe production of atomically clean surfaces\n(if ion bombardment is used, have the capability of heating the target sufficiently to\nremove buried ions and to anneal the surface)s\n\n97\n(4) employ in-situ analysis of surface, such as\nAuger spectroscopy;\n(5) maintain ability to vary incident flux in\norder to study the effect of adsorbateadsorbate interactions;\n(6) investigate the effect of ion burial on\nadsorption (if the effect is as pronounced as\nit appears, it is potentially useful for\naltering surface adsorptive characteristics)t\n(7) determine the physical mechanism which causes\nthe negative signals (this might provide an\napproach to studying adsorbate-adsorbate\ninteractions).\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n1.\n\nYoung, D.

This\nwell be due in part to lack of precision in the instrument\nused for measuring chamber pressure.\nFor the stay-time experiments, the signal is a timemust be known.\nvarying pulse and the detector time response\na\nA straightforward way to evaluate this response is to use\ndensity-versuspulsed molecular beam for which the detector\ntime is accurately known. For hn orifice operating at a\nsufficiently large Knudsen number Kn (the ratio of mean free\nhigh\npath in the source to orifice diameter) and pulsed with\ntime-of-flight resolution(26 ), the signal for a density\nsensitive deteetor is of the form\n\nS(t)\n\n1\n\nexp(-o2L2/t2)\n\n(AII.1)\n\nwhere t = flight time,\no2kTo\'\no=\nL = flight path length.\n\nDetector signals were obtained using a 0.04 cm diameter\nsingle-orifice source with nittogen gas.\n\nshown in Fig. AII.2 for two values of Kn.\n\nThe results are\n\nFor comparison,\n\nthe corresponding Maxwellian distribution from Eq.

(10) of Ref. 41.\nThe total flow rate through the multichannel source is\nrelated to the upstream number density n o by the expression\n\n2 = noC\n\n(AII.3)\n\nwhere C is the source conductance.\n\nKnowing the source cham-\n\nber pressure, temperature and volume, this conductance was\ndetermined by measuring the decay\n\nof the source chamber\n\npressure with time with the gas supply shut off.\n\nThe results\n\nof a typical measurement of the pressure decay is shown in\nFig. AII.3.\n\nFor xenon at a temperature of 295 bK, the con-\n\nductance was found to be 8 x 10- 5 I/sec, within 1% of that\npredicted by kinetic theory.\n\nThis result was confirmed by\n\nseveral separate measurements made periodically during the\ncourse of the stay-time experiments.\n\nUsing these results in\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\nExperimental - C = 7. 96 x 10\n\nO\n\nO torr\n\n-\n\n5\n\n//s\n\nCalculated from Po = o,i exp\n= 8.04 x 10-\n\n4 -C\n\n5\n\nwhere\n\n/s from free molecular theory\n\n2\n\n0\n\nII\n\n0\n\n1\n\nl\n\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nI\n\n6\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 X 103\n\nTime , sec\n\nFigure AII.3\n\nTypical Measured Source Pressure Decay with Time\nUsed for Multichannel-Source Conductance\n\nDetermination, Xe Gas\nI-\n\nI-\n\n116\nEqs.

(AII.1).\n\nThe measured distribution is narrower than the\n\nMaxwellian and results in a mean molecular energy some\n25 to 30 % higher than that for the Maxwellian distribution.\nThis is attributed in Ref. 24 primarily to collisions at the\nexit of the multichannel array.\n\nAlthough no direct beam\n\ntime-of-flight measurements were made for the gases used in\nthe present stay-time experiments, these gases are not\nexpected to produce significantly different distributions\nsince the Kn for the present study is not much different\nfrom that for the distribution in Fig. AII.4.\n\n.6\nS (t)\n\n()\n\n.\n\nMaxwellian\n\nS (t\n\nExperimental\n\n.2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\nt ,\n\nFigure AII.4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 x 10 - 4\n\nsec\n\nComparison of Measured Incident Beam Time-of-Flight\nDistribution for Multichannel Source to Maxwellian\nPrediction, po = 10 torr, N 2 Gas\nI-A\n\nAPPENDIX III\nDERIVATION OF THE EQUATIONS FOR THE SHAPE OF THE\nINCIDENT AND DESORPTION PULSES\n\nAn approximation for the shape of the incident flux\npulse Fi(t) is developed in this appendix.\n\nThis approxima-\n\ntion is then used to predict the form of the desorption\npulse for a first-order rate process.\nIncident Pulse.\nflux F\n\nConsider a molecular beam with uniform\n\nsuch that the rate at which molecules with speeds\n\nbetween v and v + dv strike an element of area dA s at a\nparticular downstream location is given by\n\ndF0 = Cvfo(v)dv\n\n(AIII.1)\n\nIn this expression, fo(v) is the incident beam speed distribution and C is a constant of proportionality.\n\nSince only\n\nthe timewise shape of the pulse is of interest, all factors\naffecting only the pulse amplitude will be included in the\nconstant C.\n\nA shutter is now introduced between the source\n\nand target at a distance xi from the target with a function\ng(t\') representing the instantaneous fraction of molecules\nthat pass through this shutter between t\' and t\' + dt\'\n\n118\n\n119\nheaded for dAs .\n\nThe flux incident upon dAs at time t is then\n\nF(t) =\n\ng(t\')\n\nSubstituting v = x 1 /(t-t\')\n\ndv\n\n_o\n\nd(t-t\')\n\n(AIII.2)\n\ngives the result\n\nx\n\n1\n(t) = F\n\n4t\'\n\n)dt\'\n\nt\n\nft\'\n\n(AIII.3)\n\nIt is now assumed that the incident beam has a\nMaxwellian speed distribution, i.e., that\n\nfo\n\nac\n\nt-2exp(-jo2x12\n\n2)\n\n(AIII.4)\n\n(Although the beam produced by the multichannel source does\nnot have this distribution exactly, it will be shown that,\nfor small xl, the shape of Fi(t) is only weakly dependent on\n\nfo(x/t).)\nThe shutter function for a uniform beam of rectangular\ncross section with width equal to the chopper slot width is\nthe triangular function\ng(t) = I + t/t s\n\nfor\n\n-ts< t<O\n\n= 1 - t/t s\n\nfor\n\n0 < t<t\n\n= 0\n\notherwise.\n\ns\n\n(AIII.5)\n\n120\n\nwhere 2ts is the basewidth of the triangle.\n\nIt can be shown\n\nthat, if ts is allowed to become very large compared to any\ntransit times and stay time, the resulting detector signal\nwill approach the shape of g(t).\n\nThis fact was used\n\nexperimentally to measure the effective value of t (see\ns\nSec. 5.2).\n\nIn addition, based on these measurements, the\n\nshape of the true g(t) was approximately determined and\nfound to be nearly Gaussian, i.e., g(t) c exp(-Bt 2\n/ts2).\nThus, for the present experiments, Eq.
