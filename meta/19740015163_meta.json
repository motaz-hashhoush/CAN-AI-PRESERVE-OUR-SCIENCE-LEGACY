The decrease of sound pressure level with distance is illustrated; and the spatial extent of the hydrodynamic and geometric near fields, the far field, and the reverberant field are described. A previously-prosposed analytical technique for predicting the far field directivity of the acoustic source on the basis of near field data is investigated. Experiments are conducted with small acoustic sources and an analysis is performed to determine the variation with distance from the source of the directionality of the sound field. A novel experiment is conducted in which the sound pressure measured at various distances from an acoustic driver located in the NASA Ames 40 x 80 ft wind tunnel is crosscorrelated with the driver excitation voltage.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740015163, "id": "1d15707da4304988a71fb6a484915247", "publicationDate": "1974-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740015163.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740015163/downloads/19740015163.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740015163/downloads/19740015163.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740015163/downloads/19740015163.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
