An analysis of the American civilian space program shows that the required technology for establishing a base on the moon will exist before the end of this century. A manned lunar base is discussed in terms of three distinct functions. The first is related to the scientific investigation of the moon and the application of special properties of the moon to research problems. In connection with the second, attention is given to the development of the capability to utilize the materials of the moon for beneficial purposes throughout the earth-moon system. The last involves research and development leading to a self-sufficient and self-supporting lunar base.", "title": "What the moon offers mankind - A review of the lunar initiative", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T10:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850030969, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nozette, S."}, "organization": {"name": "California, University", "location": "San Diego, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2d17b412973b493990d2df78c585e573"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19850030969, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Duke, M."}, "organization": {"name": "California Univ.", "location": "San Diego, CA, United States"}}, "id": "5a92e30ae51a41f68798f5a3a171dde0"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19850030969, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mendell, W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "01b43b33a9634541a77e8c64fc23440c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850030969, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850030969, "id": "2e833872c13f4c3a9e26944983805fe6", "publicationDate": "1984-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
