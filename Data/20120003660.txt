Two of these\nmachines have been used to move space flight vehicles at Kennedy Space Center since\nthe Apollo missions of the 1960\'s and relatively few modifications have been made to\nkeep them operational. In September of 2003 during normal Crawler/Transporter\noperations cracks were observed along the roller pad surfaces of several tread belt\nshoes. Further examination showed 20 cracked shoes on CT-1 and 40 cracked shoes\non CT-2 and a formal failure analysis investigation was undertaken while the cracked\nshoes were replaced. Six shoes were cross-sectioned with the fracture surfaces\nexposed and it was determined that the cracks were due to fatigue that initiated on the\ninternal casting web channels at pre-existing casting defects and propagated through\nthickness both transgranularly and intergranularly between internal shrinkage cavities,\nporosity, and along austenitic and ferritic grain boundaries. The original shoes were\ncast during the 1960\'s using a modified 861330 steel with slightly higher levels of\nchromium, nickel and molybdenum followed by heat treatment to achieve a minimum\ntensile strength of 11 Oksi. Subsequent metallurgical analysis of the tread belt shoes\nafter multiple failures showed excessive internal defects, alloy segregation, a nonuniform ferritic/ bainitic/martensitic microstructure, and low average tensile properties\nindicative of poor casting and poor heat-treatment. As a result, NASA funded an\ninitiative to replace all of the tread belt shoes on both crawler/transporters along with a\nredesign of the alloy, manufacturing, and heat-treatment to create a homogeneous cast\nstructure with uniform mechanical and metallurgical properties. ME Global, a wholly\nowned subsidiary of ME Elecmetal based in Minneapolis, MN was selected as\nmanufacturing and design partner to develop the new shoes and this paper describes\nthe research, development, and manufacturing that resulted in the successful delivery of\n1044 new Crawler/Transporter tread belt shoes all meeting rigid metallurgical and\nmechanical design criteria derived from finite element modeling of the stress loads\nrequired for safe space shuttle transport.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe crawler transporter (CT) is a tracked vehicle used at the Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC) to carry launch vehicles. Originally designed and used for Apollo missions, the\ntwo CT\'s are now used by NASA to carry space shuttles from the Vehicle Assembly\nBuilding (VAB) to the launch pads. The CT\'s weigh six million pounds and are designed\nto carry a twelve million-pound payload. Each CT travels on eight belts of shoes. These\ntracked belts each consist of a string of 57 shoes, for a total of 456 shoes on each\ncrawler transporter. Each shoe is 90 inches long, 25 inches wide and weighs\napproximately 2,100 lbs. Marion Power Shovel originally supplied the tread belt shoes in\n1965 during the original manufacture of both crawler transporters for NASA. Until the\n\nearly 1980\'s, tread belt shoes were considered consumable items and failed shoes were\nroutinely replaced. Once the original supply became depleted, a spares program was\ninitiated and shoes were purchased from both Kobe Steel, Kobe, Japan and Bay City\nCastings, Bay City, Michigan. A subsequent program was initiated in the latter 1980\'s\nfor the refurbishment of CT shoes which involved a weld repair of damaged roller pad\nsurfaces. This procedure only postponed the inevitability of failure and resulted in\ndowntime associated with exchange of shoes awaiting repair.\n2\t\n\nSHOE FAILURES\n\nThe potential for catastrophic failure of CT shoes was first noted in 1986 when long\ncracks were found along the roller path between two pin lugs on a Kobe shoe during\nrollout of a mobile launch platform (MLP). The incident was deemed isolated and the\nshoe was replaced. In 1990, two Bay City Casting shoes suffered a catastrophic failure\non transition up the hill to Launch Complex 39, Pad B. Cracks extended across the\nroller path to the pin lugs resulting in complete separation of the lugs and near\ndisengagement of the tread belt. A technician on the ground noticed the failure, called\nfor an emergency stop, and the crawler transporter was backed down the hill to\nexchange a shoe. Subsequent metallurgical failure analysis showed an extensive\nfatigue crack that had originated at subsurface casting flaws and propagated through\nthickness between the two pin lugs. All Bay City Casting shoes were then examined by\nnon destructive inspection techniques and showed a high percentage of crack shoes.\nAll Bay City Casting shoes were then removed from service and replaced with Marion or\nKobe shoes. In October 2003, a routine inspection noted a cracked shoe that displayed\nsimilar characteristics to the previous Bay City Casting shoes and an extensive visual\nborescope inspection of the internal channels and non destructive manetic particle\ninspection of the roller pads was ordered. Forty cracked shoes on CT-2 were found and\nsubsequent inspection of CT-1 found an additional twenty shoes that were cracked. All\nfractured and cracked shoes were replaced and in November 2003 a Rollout Fatigue\nTest was done on CT-2 with strain gage instrumentation installed on several random\nshoes. During this test, CT-2 traveled approximately five miles to simulate movement\nfrom the VAB to the launch pads. Inspection of the CT-2 shoes after this test revealed\nforty-three additional shoes had cracked during this Rollout Fatigue Test. Risk\nAssessment was undertaken and in February 2004 and concluded that CT operations\nwere now to be limited to level surfaces at a maximum of 0.3 mph. Additionally, CT\nmovement was minimized to avoid depleting the inventory of useable spare shoes. The\nNASA/KSC Materials Failure Analysis Laboratory completed their investigation and\nreleased their findings indicating that the failures experienced were due to fatigue that\ninitiated at casting defects on the internal web surfaces and propagated both\ntransgranular and intergranular through a segregated, non-uniform microstructure to the\nroller pad surface. Based on these results, determination was made that the CT shoes\nin service may be at or near their life limit. Factors that contributed to the failures\nincluded surface defects, improper microstructure, shrinkage cavities, and porosity in the\noriginally supplied CT shoes. Two conclusions were made following testing. First, the\nnon-destructive examination methods used to inspect the CT shoes could not\nconclusively identify serviceable shoes. Second, the available spare CT shoes in\ninventory also could be depleted with two additional CT moves. As a result of these\nfailures and the limitation of CT movement, the decision was made to replace the CT\nshoes. A Statement of Work was written and a Request for Proposal was initiated for\nthe supply of 1,044 shoes to replace all shoes on both CT\'s and have 132 spares. This\n\nproposal required the production of CT shoes to strict quality requirements with specific\ncross-section microstructure and uniform mechanical properties within a specified range\nof hardness and tensile strength to outfit both Crawler Transporters within a sixteen\nweek production schedule.\n3\t\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nME Global of Minneapolis, MN was selected as the sole supplier for the CT Shoe\nReplacement Project. Of the eight suppliers in the process, ME Global was selected as\nthe only domestic supplier with the ability to produce the required number of shoes,\nmeeting the quality requirement, and the required delivery schedule for Return to Flight\noperations. The initial prototypes were cast using a V-Process molding using silica sand\nwithout a binder that is vacuum formed into the mold shape. Internal cores were made\nusing zircon sand to enhance dimesional control and improve surface finish along the\ninternal channels. The alloy selected was a modified 4320 alloy, replacing the original\nmodified 861330 alloy designated in 1962 by Marion Power Shovel. The modified 861330\nalloy had increased chromium, molybdenum, and nickel to enhance hardenability but the\nalloy as cast was severely segregated with large internal casting defects and the\nmicrostructure contained extensive ferrite along internal casting channels with a crosssection combination of bainite and widmanstatten ferrite with a predominantly bainitic\nstructure beneath the roller pad surface indicating a low through thickness undercooling\nrate on quenching. Modeling of the new tread belt shoes using MAGMA software\nconfirmed the location of potential internal shrink defects and significant modifications to\nthe riser size and location were made along with geomtric changes to the internal\nchannels of the shoe to increase feeding to suspect locations from the gates. Heat\ntreatment involved normalizing at 1600\xc2\xb0 F for 4 hours followed by a water quench with\nmedium to high agitation.for 25 minutes followed by tempering at 1100\xc2\xb0 F for 4 hours\nfollwed by air cooling. The prototype shoes were then sectioned in 4 locations along the\nroller pad to examine the cross-section microstructure and verify the through thickness\nhardness. The structure was predominantly bainitic with finely disbursed acicular ferrite\nand the cross-section hardness ranged from 307 HB in the core to 317 HB near the\nsurface. Tensile specimens were cut from the shoes directly above the internal\nchannels for verification of mechanical properties and averaged 137 ksi UTS and 120 ksi\nYS, above the specified minimum of 130 ksi UTS, and 110 ksi YS.. Examination of the\narea under the roller pad confirmed the shrinkage cavities and large porosity found on\nthe old shoes that had failed was eliminated. A sound casting without shrink or porosity\ncould now be produced in this redesigned casting.\n4\t\n\nPRODUCTION\n\nDuring the prototype phase the critical production elements were defined and statistical\nprocess cotrols were developed to track material performance. Inspection procedures\nwere outlined and included strict surface finish requirements, chemical analysis of\nfurnace charge for each pour, 26 as-cast brinell pads for surface hardness\nmeasurement, time and temperature data for each heat-treatment lot, magnetic particle\ninspection of 100%, radiographic examination of a random 10%, ultrasonic inspection of\nan additional 10%, and destructive testing of 20 random "First Article" shoes from\nproduction lots. The first article testing included cross-section metallogrpahy, hardness,\nand tensile testing of specimens cut from directly above the internal casting channels.\n\n5\t\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe primary verification of process control was through continuous monitoring of shoe\nsurface hardness data that was downloaded daily from the foundry. Two key criteria\nwere monitored throughout the production phase for indication of loss of process control:\naverage surface hardness and surface hardness variation within each shoe. The\nfollowing charts, shown in Figure 1, display the average and range for the process with\nthe vertical line showing the point at which the tempering temperature was increased\nfrom 11000 F to 1125\xc2\xb0 F to reverse trending towards a non-compliant process.\n\n7\n\nFigure 1: Top - Average surface hardness, Bottom - Range of surface hardness measurements\nPrior to production, the process capability was evaluated and the specification limits for\nthe individual surface hardness measurments was set at the range 271-371 HB and the\naverage hardness measurements were specified by zone. When final compilation of\nproductions shoe hardness measurements are compared to the requirments, 100% of\nthe measurments conformed. The graph in Figure 2 shows the complilation of individual\nsurface hardness measurments.\n\nPrDes DW.3\n\xc2\xa31.\t\n\n371CX\n\nTag\xe2\x82\xac\n271\nWan\t\n\nex\n\n317442\n\nSeP.\n3:0ewl\'W-nn;\t\n\n13 U62\n\nSviOi: I52U,4\n\nCX30 -y\nCO\nca.\t\nCPL\t\n\nII\t\n\nLIH\t\n\nIh\t\n\nI\nt1\n\nGPk\n\nc\t\n\n413\n\nFigure 2: Process capability analysis\nInternal mechanical property data is shown in Table 1.

Final delivery of the CT\nshoes was completed in January 2005 and the initial rollout testing of the CT vehicles\nbegan on schedule in support of the Return to Flight of STS-114 in February 2005.\nRollout of Space Shuttle Discovery to Launch Complex 39B occurred on April 6, 2005 in\nanticipation of launch to the International Space Station during the May 15 to June 7\ntime frame. Failures of shoes used by the crawler transporter at Kennedy Space Center\nled to the decision by NASA to replace shoes that had been in service from the 1960\'s.\nME Global\'s proactive role in the research and development in partnership with NASA\nmechanical and metallurgical engineering groups resulted in the development of a CT\nshoe that met or exceeded the new design requirements and is anticipated to perform\nthroughout the life of the Space Shuttle program and onto service the next generation\nspace flight vehicle. ME Global manufactured over 1050 CT shoes under stringent\nquality specifications and delivered on time to meet NASA\'s stringent Return to Flight\nschedule requirements.\n\n'
