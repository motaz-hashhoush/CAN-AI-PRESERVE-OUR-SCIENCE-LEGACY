In this technique, a highly underexpanded jet issuing from the base of a 10 deg half-angle cone totally disrupts and displaces the conventional wake. The jet was rapidly shut off by an explosively actuated valve and the time for wake reestablishment was measured. The tests were conducted in the Mach 6 high Reynolds number tunnel at a stagnation temperature of 506 K and stagnation pressure of 2.86 MPa. The model base jet stagnation pressure was 3.55 MPa at room temperature. High-speed schlieren motion pictures indicated that disappearance of the disrupting jet and reestablishment of the wake-recompression shock were probably occurring simultaneously and that  the time disruptive-jet-air shutoff to wake recompression shock reestablishment was probably between 200 and 450 microseconds (flow lengths from 1.8 to 4.2). The values of flow lengths are about one-thord to one-half the values measured in impulse facilities in a previous study. This shorter time is believed to be largely due to difference in flow conditions between the jet disruption technique and impulse facilities.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740013812, "id": "5ff7fd2bddcb49e9aa8f5988213d1831", "publicationDate": "1974-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740013812.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740013812/downloads/19740013812.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740013812/downloads/19740013812.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740013812/downloads/19740013812.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
