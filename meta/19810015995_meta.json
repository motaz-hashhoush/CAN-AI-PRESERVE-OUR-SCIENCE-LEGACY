Applications include: irrigation, postharvest operation, food and fiber processing and storage, and livestock and fisheries operations. Power and energy use profiles for many applications as well as assessments of business, government and financial climate for P/V sales are described. Many characteristics of the Philippine agriculture and energy sector favorably influence the use of P/V systems. However, serious and significant barriers prevent achieving the technically feasible, cost competitive market for P/V systems in the agricultural sector. The reason for the small market is the limited availability capital for financing P/V systems. It is suggested that innovative financing schemes and promotional campaigns should be devised.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810015995, "id": "6c86b7d8cf5e4e40934344faba9c0744", "publicationDate": "1981-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810015995.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810015995/downloads/19810015995.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810015995/downloads/19810015995.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810015995/downloads/19810015995.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
