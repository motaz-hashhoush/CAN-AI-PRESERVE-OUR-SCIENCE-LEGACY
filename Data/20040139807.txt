Technical work performed on\nthese tasks will go towards meeting the objective set for the NASA Work Element 2.1:\nIntelligent Combustor.\n2.1.1: WSR Task\nWSR is a versatile laboratory research combustor that simulates the highly turbulent\ncombustion process in a practical gas turbine combustor. UD proposed to study highturbulence level turbulence-flame chemistry interactions processes in a high pressure\n(20-atm) WSR. Specifically, the WSR will provide bench-mark quality data on effects of\npressure on lean blowout (LBO),\nNOx, and particulate emissions.\n\nAccomplishments\nUD designed, fabricated, and assembled a WSR with the following specifications:\n\nOperating pressure = 1-20 atm.\nAir flow rates: 2.0 Ibm/sec\nFuel flow rate: 0.2 Ibm/sec\nResidence Time = 2-8 ms\nEquivalence ratio = 0.3-2.5\nFuels: Jet A, JP-8, heptane and decane.\nHigh-pressure WSR experiments and test results have direct practical applications in\ngas turbine combustor design in terms of improving combustion efficiency, combustion\nstability, and fuel economy and at the same time decreasing pollutant emissions. Results\nand conclusions of these studies will be of direct practical benefits to NASA Glenn,\nGEAE, Parker-Hannifin Corporation, and also the research work being performed at the\nAir Force Research Laboratory. Figure 1 shows a photograph of the atmospheric\npressure WSR. This basic design is scaled to a 20-atm pressure design as shown in\nFigure 2. At present, the WSR assembly is being incorporated in the AFRL test facility.\nStouffer et al. (2005) describe the development & combustion performance of this WSR.\n\n3\n\nPlug Flow Section\n\n(b) exploded layout\nFigure 2: A 20-atm WSR\n\n4\n\n2.1.2: Shock Tube Task\nUD proposed to build a new 50-atm. shock tube test facility to study ignition processes,\nchemical kinetics, and formation of short-duration pollutant species in the ultra-high\npressure, ultra-fuel lean advanced gas turbine combustors of the future. In the past, UD\nhas expertise in using shock tubes to study the combustion characteristics of various jet\nfuels, alternative fuels for light duty vehicles (premixed gases), alternative diesel fuels\nthat are being formulated to reduce particulate emission (liquid sprays), and. the\ncomposite ignition delay of high performance aviation fuels (liquid sprays).\n\nAccomplishments\nUD designed, fabricated, assembled, and tested a 50--bars shock tube:\n\nOperating pressure = 50 atm.\nTemperature: 500-3OOOC\nResidence Time =O.l to 8 ms\nFuels: Jet A, JP-8; heptane and decane.\nFigure 3 shows the assembled view of the shock tube. We initiated the high-pressure\nheptane combustion experiments. Figure 4 shows an example data from one of the\nshakedown experiments. This data was taken using 46Opsig helium driving 12.3psig\n(138Otorr) argon. The calculated final temperature and pressure using an ideal gas\nmodel were 48.4atm and 1160"C, respectively. The reaction dwell time for this\nexperiment was 2ms which was measured from the moment the incident shock arrived\nat the end plate till the arrival of rarefaction wave.\n\n-\n\nSidhu et al.

TAPS combustor test facility and adapt it\nto the AFRL high pressure combustor research facility. The TAPS task involves the\nstudy of turbulent fuel-air mixing, measurement of fuel concentration profiles\ndownstream of the GEAE TAPS fuels injector, and studies of combustion processes.\nThese tests will be performed using various fuels, and for idle and full power conditions.\nSuch database will be used by GEAE to formulate a comprehensive mechanistic model\nof TAPS combustion that will be capable of predicting mixing patterns, lean blowout, and\nthe formation of gaseous and soot pollutants.\n\nAccomplishments\nFigure 5 shows the TAPS combustor rig.\n\nire\nFig1 5: TAPS pressure vessel (a) quartz windows for optical acce!SS\n. .
