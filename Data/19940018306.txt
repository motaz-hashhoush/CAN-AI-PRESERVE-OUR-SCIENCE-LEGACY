In\naddition to the two primary services, voice and telex, a\nnumber of enhanced services have been added. The\n\nfor mobile\n\nSimilarly, the portability and simplicity of use\nhas made Inmarsat-A communications\ntool of choice to\nhundreds of media teams all over the world to cover\nsummits, scenes of natural disasters and wars. The\n\ndata and facsimile are two of the early services using\nthe telephone channel. Full CCITT Group III operation\nis supported - the line speed (2400/4800/9600\nbits/sec)\nbeing determined\nby the terrestrial connection.\n\nInmarsat-A\nportable terminal is an icon representing\nthe\nmobile satellite industry that is recognisable\nto millions\nover the world.\n\nHigh Speed\n\nINMARSAT-A\n\nRecently, two new services were introduced 56kbits/s - 64 kbit/s High Speed Data (HSD) and\nDuplex High Speed Data (DHSD).\nCurrently available\nfrom several MES manufacturers\nare 56 or 64 kbit/s\n\nlnmarsat-A is an analog telephone and telex\nsystem. It operates on a single channel per carrier basis\nusing frequency modulation\nand hence provides a linear\nchannel supporting full duplex operation.

The HSD signal is sent\nto one of several LES that provide for automatic or\nsemi-automatic\ninterconnection\nto terrestrial switched\ndigital\n\nnetworks,\n\ne.g.\n\nCOMSAT,\n\nEik or Goonhilly.\n\nFor Duplex High Speed Data (DHSD) operation,\nfully automatic, single number dialling has been\nadopted. The DHSD call starts as a duplex voice grade\ncircuit, until the MES is switched to data mode.

In contrast, the contemporary\ntransportable terminal could weigh as little as 23 kg\nincluding the foldable antenna.

It would consume only about 280\nwatts during transmit.\n\nsatellite and either the public\nservices.\n\nor private\n\nterrestrial\n\nsent at random. An acknowledgement\nof delivery is\nalways provided. The polling service is used to initiate\ntransmission\nof a data report from a mobile terminal.\nThe polling signal defines how and when the terminal\nshould respond and can address single or multiple\nterminals and optionally,\nit can also be limited to a\ndefined geographical\narea. The Enhanced Group Call\n(EGC) service is a fundamental\npart of the Inmarsat-C\nsystem and provides the ability to broadcast messages\nto mobiles in a very flexible manner. The Land Mobile\nAlerting function is a special type of data reporting\npacket, used for alerting the LES and/or other service\nproviders about an emergency\n(or a high priority\nmessage) via an Inmarsat-C terminal.\n\nservice\n\nduring this year, is the digital version of the Inmarsat-A\nsystem.\nIt is also capable of operating with the spot\nbeams of Inmarsat-3\nsatellites. Being an advanced\ndigital system, there is scope for reduction in the space\nsegment resource requirement,\nand therefore for a\nreduction in the end user charges. This fact will be\nparticularly\nwelcome by high volume users, as well as\nby new ones who will now see the economic hurdle to\nbecoming an Inmarsat user considerably\nlowered. This,\nin turn, should give a renewed impetus to the use of\nsatcoms by both the business community\nand by the\ninternational\nemergency and aid organisations.\nThe system provides voice, data, fax group calls\nand telex. Near toll quality voice is provided using 16\nkbits/s voice codec algorithm. The GFF requirement\nof\nthe terminal is the same as of Inmarsat-A\n(-4 dBK),\nhence the antenna requirements\nremain the same. One\ncompact Inmarsat-B MES already available weighs 18\nkg including a flat panel antenna. Its polymer\npackaging case is watertight when packed, and rainproof when deployed, and can withstand a 30-inch drop\non concrete.

Particularly\nin case\nof accidents in remote areas, satcoms are indispensable.\nCountries like China, Russia, Australia and others on all\ncontinents have tested Inmarsat-C\nfor this purpose. The\nresults are very encouraging\nand may lead to significant\nimplementation\nschemes in the near future.\n\nRoad Transport\n\nOne of the main\n\nsuccesses\n\nfor Inmarsat-C\n\nhas\n\nbeen in the support of fleet management\nfor the road\ntransport industry. With this system, it is possible to set\nup closed user networks with any number of vehicles,\nas well as one or any number of individual users in an\nopen network configuration.\nFleet management\nis\npossible by continuous contact between the driver\n(and/or vehicle computer)\nand the dispatcher.\nShort data\nreports from vehicles, containing\nthe position\ninformation\ndetermined\nby the integral GPS receiver,\ncan be received and temporarily\nstored at the LES for\ndelivery by a terrestrial link. They c0uldbe\ntransrnitted\ndirectly to a lnmarsat-C\nat the dispatcher\'s\noffice, using\na \'double hop\'. This method, obviating the need for a\nterrestrial line altogether,\ncan be very useful in cases\nwhere the terrestrial link is unavailable\nor unreliable.\n\nOffice\n\nOn The Move\n\nBecause of its worldwide reach and easy\nportability, lnmarsat-C\nis becoming\na favourite with\nprint journalists,\naid workers and even the general\nbusiness traveller. The most alluring feature of the\nsystem is the ability to send text files, even fairly large\n(up to 32 kbytes), composed on a PC attached to the\nInmarsat-C transceiver,\ndirectly to a fax number, to\nanother PC via PSTN or PSDN, and to send and\n\nRural,\n\noperators as a most exciting feature - one that cannot be\nobtained over very large areas by terrestrial means. The\nsatcom-based\nmethod of fleet management\nand control\nhas saved many trucking companies thousands of\ndollars annually, making the investment in Inmarsat-C\npay for itself in a very short time. There are several\nend-to-end\nsolutions already on the market and \'onestop-shops\'\nfor system implementation\nare now\nestablished on both sides of the Atlantic, e.g. in the\nNetherlands,\nthe UK, Brazil and elsewhere.\n\nRemote\n\nand Backup\n\nLow investment\n\nCommunications\n\ncost as well as the ever\n\nexpanding array of access modes and applications\nmake\nInmarsat-C\nan ideal system for all sorts of situations\nwhere voice contact is not required or is not necessary.\nEntry or retrieval of information\nin remote locations,\nwhether by rural hospitals or by educational\ninstitutions\nor businesses,\nis a fast developing\nInmarsat-C\nmarket.\nSeveral specific software applications\naxe now under\ndevelopment\nin Various parts of the world, for example\nto address rural banking requirements.\nAn attractive\napplications\narea for lnmarsat-C\nnetworking\nis\nestablishment\nof communications\nnetworks for\n\ntwo-way messaging\ncan provide\nin the mobile environment.\nA very\n\ngood example of this is the use of lnmarsat-C\nby a\nnumber of UN agencies, particularly\nby the UN High\nCommissioner\nfor Refugees in Bosnia and elsewhere,\nsubstantially\nimproving\nthe logistics control and\n\nElectronic\n\nretrieve messages from a mailbox set up at the LES or\nat any other appropriate\npoint along the network.\nRecent advances in applications\ndevelopment\nalso allow\na direct connection to e-mail networks, enabling the\nInmarsat-C\nuser to become\na remote or mobile X.400\nuser[\n\nRegular position reports can be displayed on a\ndigital map in a dispatcher\'s\noffice, together with a\npossible accompanying\nmessage. The ability to poll\nindividual vehicles or entire fleets is seen by trucking\n\nEven simple\nsubstantial benefits\n\nTracking\nof vehicles, trailers or cargo containers\nis another very good prospect for Inmarsat-C.\nIt\nrequires development\nof a securely mounted \'package\'\n\ndispersed communities,\nAfrica and Asia.\n254\n\nfor example\n\nin Latin America,\n\nplane to track the satellite.
