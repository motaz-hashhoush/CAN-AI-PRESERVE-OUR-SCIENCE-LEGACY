A helium diffusion process which eliminates most of the bubbles in the glass coating has been found that\ngreatly increases the effective dielectric strength of the glass\nand allows acceptable low voltage ion extraction. Grid fabrication\ntechniques and experimental performance results are also discussed .\nINTRODUCTION\nApplications for electrostatic ion thrusters at specific impulses\n\nof 3,000 seconds or less, appear promising (ref. 1. This is\n)\nmainly because photovoltaic solar cells may be the only flight quali-\n\nfied power source readily available and suitable for near term\napplication, and a relatively low specific impulse is necessary to\nmaximize the payload with the high specific mass of solar-cell\npower sources.\n\nTM X-52425\n\n2\n\nPrevious Kaufman thrusters have been optimized at higher\nspecific impulse. Some thruster modifications are required to\nassure optimum performance at low voltage (net accelerating\nvoltages of 1000 volts or less), The component that would require the most redesign is the ion accelerator grid system,\nRecent tests of a composite accelerator grid system indi-\n\ncate the possibility of substantial performance gains over the\nconventional double grid ion extraction system (ref. 2). A composite accelerator grid system is one in which an electrical insulator is placed in close proximity or in contact with a metallic\naccelerator grid. The insulator, in effect, replaces the screen\ngrid which separates the plasma in the discharge chamber from\nthe acceleration region in the conventional grid system.\nResults of tests on composite accelerator grids are reported\nherein. First, background information is given with emphasis\nupon the fused-glass type of composite accelerator grid. Next,\nin the theory section a helium diffusion process is described which\nhelps to eliminate large bubbles normally found in the fused glass\ncoating. A brief description of the fabrication procedure for\nconstructing a fused glass composite grid is then given followed\nby a discussion of experimental results.\nBACKGROUND\n\nA section view of a Kaufman, or electron-bombardment, ion\nthruster is depicted in Fig. 1. Typically, mercury vapor is fed\n\n3\n\ninto the ionization chamber by passing it through a distributor\nplate. The atoms of the vaporized gas are then bombarded by\nelectrons emitted from the cathode. The path length traveled by\nelectrons going from the cathode to the anode is greatly increased\nby the axial magnetic field thus causing much more ionization by\nelectron-bombardment.\n\nIons in the near vicinity of the screen\n\ngrid have a high probability of being accelerated through the holes\nin the screen and accelerator grid because of the high electric\nfields present there. After the ions accelerate through the grid\nsystem (thus producing a thrust) electrons are injected to neutralize the exhaust beam, Detailed information concerning the\nthruster and neutralizer can be found in Refs. 3 and 4 respectively.\nThe screen grid of the conventional double grid system shown in\nFig. 1 serves the purposes of containing the discharge plasma\nand forming the necessary ion optics to prevent direct impingment of the accelerated ions on to the accelerator grid.\nSection views of a conventional double grid system and a\nfused glass composite accelerator grid are compared in Figs. 2(a)\nand (b). In the conventional system, the plasma sheath is formed\n\nat the upstream surface of the screen grid, In the composite grid\nsystem the sheath is believed to form near the upstream surface\nof the insulator. Because of the high electrical resistance of the\ninsulator, charges can build up on the surface forming a virtual\nscreen grid, In this way the sheath is moved closer to the nega-\n\n4\n\n.\n\ntive accelerator, thus increasing the field strength for a given\nvoltage and consequently increasing the ion beam current density.\nA close up view of the glass coated side and uncoated side of a\ntypical fused glass composite grid is shown in Figs. 3(a) and (b).\nSome advantages of a fused glass composite grid system\nover the conventional double grid system for low voltage thruster\noperation are as follows:\n\n1. Close spacing and accurate alinement of the screen and\naccelerator grids during assembly is no longer, required. Also,\nthe grids cannot become misalined by warpage during thruster\n\noperation. This leads to the possibility of large diameter accelerator systems previously considered impractical for low voltage operation.\n2. The single, glass composite grid does not require match\n\ndrilling of screen and accelerator holes. Therefore, prepunched\n\nsheet can be used for the metallic portion.\n3. A reduction in weight of the accelerator grid system is\n\npossible with elimination of the screen grid and use of a simplified support structure,\n4. The discharge chamber power loss is reduced because of\n\nthe enhanced ion extraction capability (ref. 5). Two possible fact o r s contributing to the increased ion current density for a given\nvoltage are (a) the increased field strength previously mentioned,\n\n5\n\nand (b) an increase in the sheath area available for ion extraction.\nSome of the factors that had to be considered before these\npotential advantages could be realized are discussed below.\n\nFor efficient thruster operation, the accelerator electrode\nshould be as close as possible to the discharge chamber plasma\nto permit the highest possible ion extraction rate. A s a result\nthe composite grid glass thickness should be only as thick as\nneeded to prevent electrical breakdown through the glass. (The\n\nelectrical potential which is applied across the glass is approximately the net accelerating potential, VI, plus the magnitude of\nthe accelerator potential, VA. ) There is a high probability\nthough, that bubbles formed in the glass coating during fabrication\nwill enhance the occurrence of electrical breakdown through the\n\nglass. In fabrication the glass is slurry sprayed onto the molybdenum grid, which is then heated in an inert atmosphere to fuse the\nglass particles together and to the grid. The fusing of the glass\nparticles encapsulates gas. Bubbles are thus formed which, in\nturn, reduce the effective electrical breakdown strength of the\nglass. The gas encapsulation could be reduced by vacuum fusing,\nbut various gas liberating mechanisms tend to make the glass to\nboil and f i l l in the grid holes with the foaming glass. Alternatively,\nthe electrical breakdown strength could be increased by applying\nadditional glass coatings to the grid, but there is a well defined\nthickness beyond which grid holes will f i l l in if more glass is applied.\n\n6\nOne obvious answer to this dilemma is to eliminate the bubbles in the glass coating. A procedure to accomplish this has\nbeen developed and will now be presented,\nTHEORY\nIf the glass is applied such that the maximum glass radius,\n\nis greater than the hole radius, rh, (see Figs. 4(a)\nr\ng,m=\'\nand (b)) then the molten glass surface tension will collapse the\n\nwalls of the hole during the fusing process. It was show in\nfor stable\nRef. 6 that the maximum glass thickness, L\ng, max\'\nhole walls depends on the metal hole radius, rm, fraction open\n\narea, Fm, of the metal grid and the thickness, Lm, of the metal\ngrid. The relationship can be written as\n\nI\n\n"\n\n1\n\nFigure 5 is a plot of the stability limit relationship as a function\nof fraction open area of the metal grid.\nIn addition to applying glass coatings up to the stability limit,\n\na further increase in the electrical breakdown strength can be\nachieved through the use of a helium diffusion process which eliminates nearly all the bubbles. This process consists of fusing the\n\n7\npowdered glass in a helium environment which produces helium\nbubbles in the molten glass. Then, while the grid is still hot,\nthe helium environmental gas is replaced with argon. This\ncauses a high helium concentration gradient in the molten glass\nsince the helium partial pressure in the bubble is atmospheric\npressure plus that due to the surface tension of the bubble\n\nSUF-\n\nface, while at the same time there is a near zero helium par-\n\ntial pressure above the glass surface. The rate of helium diffusion has been found to be sufficient to collapse the bubbles\ninitially formed in the glass. The following equation, which is\nderived in Ref. 6, relates bubble radius and diffusing time.\n\nFigure 6 is theoretical plot of bubble radius, rg, t, at time, t\',\n\nfor a glass temperature of 1444\' K (1171\' C) and a typical initial\n4\nbubble radius, rg, o, of 10- meters. For this calculation, the\nhelium diffusion coefficient of Corning glass code 7052 at 1444\' K\n\nis K\n\n= 4. 56x10-l1 m2/sec,\n\ncode 7052 is y\n\nthe surface tension of Corning glass\n\n2. 73x10- 1 N/m, and the atmospheric pressure\n\nis Po E l.OlXl0 5 N/m 2\n\n.\n\nA s the bubble radius decreases the\n\nsurface tension forces greatly increase the helium bubble pres-\n\n8\nsure thus enhancing the rate of diffusion and the rate of bubble\ncollapse as shown by the change in slope of the curve in Fig. 6.\nThe time for bubble collapse to zero radius is obtained from\n\nEq. (2) by setting r\n\nB,t\n\n=\n\n0 and is given by\n\nI\n\nThis collapse time, t;, is plotted as a function of the initial bubble radius in Fig. 7.\nThe times given in Figs. 6 and 7 are for helium diffusion at\n\nL\n\n14\' K. The corresponding time, t, at other temper tures, Tg,\n44\nis found by simply multiplying the time t\' by the factor t/t? as\ngiven by Fig. 8. This figure takes into account the temperature\ndependence of the helium diffusion coefficient for Corning glass\ncode 7052.\n\nGRID FABMCATION PROCEDURE\nA s a result of theoretical and experimental investigations a\n\nsuitable fused glass composite grid fabrication procedure has been\ndeveloped. It is given in detail in Ref. 6 and briefly described\nbelow for a molybdenum grid to be coated with Corning glass\ncode 7052.\n\n9\n\n1, Determine stability limit from Fig. 5.\n2. Deburr the grid and wash it with water then acetone.\n\n3. Glass bead blast entire grid and oxidize it is an\nelectric oven at 538\' C for 5 to 10 minutes until a blue or\npurple surface coloration is present.\n4. Sand oxide layer off the downstream face of the molyb-\n\ndenum grid.\n5, Slurry spray the upstream face of the grid with a solu-\n\ntion consisting of equal parts (by volume) of water and powdered\nglass.\n6. Set the grid on a clean oxidation resistant tray or edge\n\nsupport it in the oxidation resistant environmental control box\n\nas shown in Fig. 9 and put lids on the box without any sealing\n\nmaterial in the trough. Note that the box has two lids each with\nits own gas feed system, This arrangement minimizes the\namount of back diffusion of oxygen to the grid.\n7. Fuse the glass coating following the time environment\n\nsequence given in Fig. 10 using inert gas purging rates of\napproximately 6X10m4 m3 per second per meter of lid perimeter.\n8. For each additional coating repeat steps 4 to 7.\n9. Sand the downstream face of the grid to expose the molyb-\n\ndenum surface before operation in a thruster.\n\n10\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nThe effectiveness of the bubble reduction process can be\nseen from a comparison of Figs, ll(a)and (b) which are photographs taken looking normal to the glass surface with the molybdenum surface underneath. The glass coating shown in Fig. ll(a)\n\nwas fused in an argon atmosphere. The amount of bubble collapse is neglibile. Figure ll(b) shows a bubble-free glass coating\n\nthat was fused using the helium diffusion process. The effective\nbreakdown strength of the bubble free glass was measured to be\n8 . 7 5 ~ 1 0 ~ (for glass coating thicknesses of approximately\nv/m\n0.4 mm) which is more than a,factor of 8 improvement over the\n\nglass coatings made using only an argon environment.\nFigure 12 is a close-up photograph of the glass coated side\nof a grid fabricated using the bubble reduction process. The\n\nphotograph was taken after the grid was operated for more than\n200 hours on a 5 cm diameter thruster with no degradation in\nperformance. Operating conditions were: net accelerating\npotential, 400 volts; accelerator potential, -225 volts; ion beam\ncurrent, 0.032 amperes; and accelerator drain currents of about\n0.002 amperes\n\n.\n\nA s can be seen in Fig. 12 sputtered material accumulated\nin some regions where the glass surface was close to o r in con-\n\ntact with the discharge plasma. However, even in these regions\n\n11\nthe hole walls remained clean. Apparently the rate of mercury\nion sputter -cleaning of the glass hole walls exceeded the rate of\ndeposition of the sputtered material,\nLarger diameter fused glass composite grids, such as the\none shown in Fig. 13, have been fabricated, This grid is mounted\non a 30 cm diameter thruster and has approximately 12,400\nprepunched holes. An optimization program for a 30 cm diam-\n\neter thruster is presently being:conducted at LGwis By\nRobert T. Bechtel. A typical thruster operating point is given\nbelow:\nParameter\n\nValue\n\nNet accelerating pot ential\nAccelerator pot ential\nIon beam current\nAccelerator drain current\nDischarge chamber power loss\nPropellant utilization efficiency\n\n1000 volts\n-700 volts\n1 . 5 amperes\n0.07 amperes\n250 electron volts per beam ion\n0.80\n\nThe accelerator system was found to give satisfactory performance\nover a range of net accelerating potentials from 400 to 1100 volts.\n\nAt these low net accelerating potentials at least partial neutralization of the exhaust ion beam by means of a hot w i r e or a\nplasma bridge neutralizer was found necessary for stable thruster\noperation in both the 5 and 30 cm thruster tests.\n\n12\nVibrations developed during launch of a glass grid thruster\nsystem might easily excite drum modes of oscillation for the flat\ngrids shown in Figs. 12 and 13. Some shake tests have been conducted and the small diameter glass coated grids for 5 cm thrusters\nhave withstood shake tests exciting the drum modes of oscillation\n\nat levels up to 30 g\'s of random noise (20 to 2000 Hz) and 40\'s\nof sinusoidal oscillation (39 to 3,000 Hz). For these tests the\ngrid was clamped rigidly at its edges beyond a 6.7 cm diameter\n\ncircle. The fundamental drum mode of oscillation was found to\nbe at 967 Hz. A considerable amount of rigidity can be added to\nthe glass coating by dishing the molybdenum grid prior to glass\ncoating. Figure 14 is a photograph of a dished glass coated grid\nfor a diameter thruster. The grid has a radius of curvature of\n\n44.6 cm and is held in place by a retaining assembly around its\nouter edge. Detail of the retaining assembly are shown in Fig. 15.\nThe two molybdenum rings are fused together with glass which\nprovides both mechanical support and electrical isolation for the\ngrid, The glass insulation is extended into the first row of holes\n\nso that a portion can be kept clean by ion bombardment. Other-\n\nwise sputtered material would creat a breakdown path along the\nsurface. This grid is currently being tested on an operating\nthruster ,.\n\n,I3\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nThis paper briefly described the recent results of a composite\ngrid program for low voltage, mercury electron-bombardment\nion thrusters. Major considerations and findings of the program\n\nare listed below.\n1. The fused glass composite grid is a potentially attractive\n\ngrid system for low voltage thrusters because it eliminates\nseveral spacing, alinement, and fabrication difficulties present\nin conventional double grid systems.\n2. Glass can be applied to the grid up to a well defined limit\n\nthat is a function of the metal grid\'s hole radius, thickness, and\nfraction open area.\n3. A procedure for minimizing the occurrence of bubbles in\n\nthe glass coating has been developed.\n\n4. Fused glass grids have been successfully fabricated and\noperated in 5, 15, and 30 cm diameter thrusters. Tests of\nmore than 200 hours of grid operation have given no indication\nof failure.\n5. A fused glass composite grid for a 5 cm diameter thruster\n\nhas withstood shake tests exciting the drum mode of oscillation\n\nat levels of 30 g*s of random noise (20 to 2000 Hz) and 40 g v sof\nsinusoidal oscillation (39 to 3000 Hz).\n\n14\n6. A glass coated grid has been fabricated which is dished for\nrigidity and has an electrically isolated mounting system as an\nintegral part of the grid., It is now being tested on an operating\n15 cm diameter thruster.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
