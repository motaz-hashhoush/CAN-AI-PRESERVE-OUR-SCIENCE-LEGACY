The photographs record the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface changes over time, along with dynamic events such as storms, floods, fires and volcanic\neruptions. These images provide researchers on Earth with key data to better understand the planet.\nResearch Summary:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAstronaut acquired imagery documents human impacts on the Earth, such as city growth,\nagricultural expansion, and reservoir construction and other natural phenomenon like volcanoes\nand hurricanes. Today, handheld photography of the world from human spaceflight missions,\nspanning more than 40 years, provides valuable insight into Earth processes and the effects of\nhuman activities on the planet.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThrough their photography of the Earth, International Space Station crewmembers will build on\nthe time series of imagery started with the first human spaceflights, ensuring that this continuous\nrecord of Earth remains unbroken. Photographs taken from ISS accounts for almost 1/2 of all\nEarth photographs from human space flight.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDuring Increment 15 through Increment 18, a new activity is being conducted in collaboration with\nInternational Polar Year activities. Crew Earth Observations - International Polar Year (CEO-IPY)\nis an international collaboration of scientists for the observation and exploration of Earth\'s Polar\nRegions from March 2007 to March 2009. The ISS crewmembers will photograph polar\nphenomena including auroras and mesospheric clouds in response to requests made from the\nscientists on the ground.\n\nDetailed Research Description: Crewmembers use handheld cameras and a variety of lenses (including\nan 800-mm lens) to take Earth observation photographs. The photographs are cataloged for use as\neducational and research tools, as well as historical records of global environmental change, special\ngeological and weather events, and the growth and change of human-made features, such as cities. CEO\nis conducted from any nadir-viewing window on the ISS, including the optical-quality window in the U.S.\nLaboratory Module, Destiny.\nThe window in Destinycan view 39.5 degrees forward along the axis of the Station, 32.2 degrees aft, and\na total of 79.1 degrees from port to starboard. The window is constructed of four panes. The outermost\npane, made of fused silica, is designed to withstand orbital debris and can be changed out by\nextravehicular activity (EVA) if it becomes damaged. The two center panes, also made of fused silica, are\nthe primary and redundant pressure panes. The interior pane, made of glass laminate, is called the\nscratch or "kick" pane. This pane protects the primary pressure pane from scratches and damage caused\nby contact with the crew, and has an ultraviolet/infrared coating to protect the crew and improve picture\nquality. The windows in the Russian Zvezda Module are also available for hand-held photography.\nProject Type: Payload\nImages and Captions:\n\nNASA Image: ISS013E67242 - An oblique high magnification view of Christchurch New Zealand taken in\nAugust 2006. This represents the 250,000th image of Earth taken from ISS. Now about 35% of the\nimages of Earth taken by astronauts come from ISS, with the first images from Apollo predating Earth\nobserving satellites.\n\nNASA Image: ISS0013E6947 - The terminus of the Viedma Glacier, is shown in this photograph taken\nfrom ISS by the Expedition 13 crew. The image was the image of the week on NASA\'s Earth Observatory,\nand published with an explanation of the various data sets scientists are using to monitor the effects of\nglobal climate changes on glaciers worldwide.\n\nNASA Image: ISS017E10303 - One of the largest and most destructive fires raging across California over\nthe July 4th weekend was the Basin Fire, threatening Big Sur, and covering the coast in a thick blanket of\nsmoke. Astronaut Greg Chamitoff, observing the fires from 344 km above the Earth (215 miles) aboard\nthe International Space Station, was able to capture the regional view of the smoke pall. At the time this\nimage was taken, more than 300 fires were burning in California alone. This Basin Fire was triggered by a\nthunderstorm, has burned 77,000 acres, and is still only partially contained.\n\nNASA Image: ISS017E10310 - The Piute fire, burning south of Lake Isabella in the Sequoia National\nForest in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, is one of the more than 300 wildfires burning across the\nstate of California. The fire started June 28 just north of Twin Oaks, California, and has burned nearly\n14,000 acres so far. Current estimates by fire officials suggest the fire may not be brought under control\nfor another 2 weeks.\n\nNASA Image: ISS009E09952 - Solitons Mosaic, Strait of Gibraltar, taken during Increment 9. These\nsubsurface internal waves occur at depths of about 100 m, but appear in the sunglint as giant swells\nflowing eastward into the Mediterranean Sea. This is one of the best pictures to date capturing the full\nphenomenon. The Navy is funding an "Atlas of Internal Waves" that is drawing heavily on astronaut\nphotography of the phenomenon to identify patterns of waves around the world. The ability to predict\ninternal waves is growing, and ISS astronauts are also working to get photographs of areas where they\nare predicted, but have not yet been documented to make sure the atlas is complete. Human\nphotographers are uniquely able to use sunglint to get the most informative photographs by choosing the\nsecond at which they take the image to get the optimum sunglint.\n\nNASA Image: ISS006E18372 - This picture is a shot taken during Increment 6 of an Aurora with the\nManicouagan impact crater on the surface. The Manicouagan Crater in northern Canada is one of the\noldest impact craters known. Formed during a surely tremendous impact about 200 million years ago, the\npresent day terrain supports a 70-kilometer diameter hydroelectric reservoir in the telltale form of an\nannular lake.\n\nNASA Image: ISS017E005600 - The Expedition 17 crew captured this image of the Tropical Cyclone\nNargis in the Bay of Bengal prior to landfall in Burma on May 2, 2008.\n\nNASA Image: ISS017E006216 - This photograph of the May 2, 2008 eruption of Chait\xc3\xa9n Volcano in\nsouthern Chile show the volcanic ash plume. Scientific research indicates that the last eruption of this\nvolcano occurred around 7400 B.C.\n\nNASA Image: ISS008E8951 - Thinning Upper Atmosphere: From a vantage point about 360 km (225\nmiles) over the Earth, Space Station crewmembers photographed the crescent moon through the upper\nlayers of Earth\'s atmosphere. At the bottom of the image, a closed deck of clouds is probably at about 6\nkm (3 miles). The shades of blue grading to black are caused by the scatter of light as it strikes gas\nmolecules of the very low density upper atmosphere. Models predict that emissions of carbon dioxide are\ncausing the upper atmosphere to cool and contract, and therefore reduce the density of gases in the layer\nspanning from 90 to 649 km (60 to 400 miles) above the surface-known as the thermosphere. According\nto a study by the Naval Research Laboratory, the density of the thermosphere has decreased about 10\npercent over the last 35 years. These findings are important both for space science and for Earth science.\nSpacecraft in orbit, such as the International Space Station, experience less drag and need fewer boosts\nto maintain their orbit. At the same time, space debris also remains in orbit longer, which increases\nhazards to spacecraft. Most importantly, the study validates models of the "greenhouse effect" of\nincreased carbon dioxide release on the dynamics of the atmosphere.\n\nNASA Image: ISS012E13692 - A 25-kilometer long smoke plume from a fire in the Upper Ouachita\nNational Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Louisiana. The fire started at approximately 1:00 p.m. on January\n2, 2006, and this image was acquired approximately three and a half hours later as the International\nSpace Station passed over the Texas-Louisiana border, to the southwest of the scene. The long extent of\nthe plume reflects the strong westerly winds that drove the fire eastwards and damaged an estimated\n200-300 acres of the wildlife refuge.\n\nNASA Image: ISS013E82951 - Astronaut Jeff Williams, Expedition 13 NASA Science Officer and Flight\nEngineer, smiles for the camera while surrounded by assorted camera gear onboard of the International\nSpace Station. Williams took many images of the Earth throughout his mission.\n\nNASA Image: ISS013E24184 - Expedition 13 ISS Science Officer and Flight Engineer Jeff Williams\ncaptured the eruption of the Cleveland Volcano, Aleutian Islands, Alaska on May 23, 2006. This eruption\nwas first reported to the Alaska Volcano Observatory by astronaut Williams. This image, acquired shortly\nafter the beginning of the eruption, captures the ash plume moving west-southwest from the summit vent.\nThe eruption was short-lived; the plume had completely detached from the volcano summit two hours\nlater. Ash plumes from Cleveland Volcano have reached heights of 12 kilometers and can present a\nhazard to trans-Atlantic jet flights. The fog bank visible at image top center is a common feature of the\nAleutian volcanoes. Cleveland Volcano, situated on the western half of Chuginadak Island, is one of the\nmost active of the volcanoes in the Aleutian Island chain extending west-southwest from the Alaska\nmainland.\nOperations Location: ISS Inflight\nBrief Research Operations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCrewmembers are responsible for photographing various sites, which are up-linked daily.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nISS allows essentially continuous research with trained observers, monitoring seasonal changes\nas well as ephemeral events such as volcanic eruptions and plankton blooms. Of particular\ninterest are such things as urban land use, agriculture and deforestation.\n\nOperational Requirements: Crew members spend approximately 10 minutes a day, five days a week,\nrecording their Earth observations. Some crew members have found Earth observations very enjoyable,\nand have dedicated extra time to photographing the beautiful and extraordinary views from the windows\nof ISS.\nOperational Protocols: A list of regions to be photographed is uplinked to the ISS daily, except during\ndocked operations; crew members also select regions to photograph. Currently, all CEO images are\ncaptured with an electronic still camera and downlinked daily. All imagery is cataloged and stored by the\nEarth Sciences and Image Analysis Laboratory at Johnson Space Center and are accessible via the\nGateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth.\nReview Cycle Status: PI Reviewed\nCategory: Observing the Earth and Educational Activities\nSub-Category: Observing the Earth\nSpace Applications: The imagery captured by astronauts during long duration missions provide insight\nfor planetary surveys within our solar system and anomalies that occur in low Earth orbit.\nEarth Applications: Earth observations have been an activity of choice for astronauts since the\nbeginning of the human space program. Scientists focus on current dramatic changes in dynamic regions\nand request the crew to photograph these sites from their orbiting outpost. These interesting and often\nbeautiful photographs provide valuable information that allow a better understanding and awareness of\nour planet from many perspectives; which include Earth\'s short and long-term events (hurricanes, floods,\nfires, volcanic eruptions, coral reefs and droughts), the impacts of human intervention (agricultural\n\ndevelopment, biomass burnings, urban and suburban sprawl, and pollution), and features that are\nanalogous to structures on other planets (craters, river deltas, and dried rivers).\nThrough their photography of the Earth, International Space Station astronauts will build on imagery\nstarted in 1961, ensuring that this continuous record of Earth remains consistent. These images are\navailable on the Internet, which allows the general public to study and view the living Earth from the\nunique perspective of space. These images are quite popular as evidenced by the fifteen million viewers\nwho visit this NASA Earth Observation website monthly.\nManifest Status: Continuing\nSupporting Organization: Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD)\nPrevious Missions: Crew Earth Observations have been ongoing since 1961and more than 300,000\nimages have been taken during the first seven years of ISS operations.\nResults: ISS provides a unique opportunity to capture a variety of sites on Earth by providing repeated\noverflight passes of the Earth. Through CEO, ISS crewmembers share their view of the Earth with the\npublic and take pictures of some of the most dramatic examples of change on the Earth\'s surface. These\nsites have included major deltas in south and east Asia, coral reefs, cities, smog over industrial regions,\nareas that typically experience floods or droughts triggered by El Nino cycles, alpine glaciers, tectonic\nstructures, and features on Earth, such as impact craters, that are analogs to structures on other planets.\nSome of the unique images of Earth taken by astronauts from station from 2000 - 2003 provides\ninformation concerning the Earth not available from any other source, and is available in an online\ncollection of ISS Greatest Hits. In 2004 and 2005, station astronauts took key photographs of the four\nFlorida hurricanes, the December 2004 tsunami affects, Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, and the\naftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\nFrom Expedition 1 through December 2006, ISS crewmembers took more than 270,000 images of Earth,\nalmost one half of the total number of images taken from orbit by astronauts since the first Gemini\nmissions. Scientists and the public around the world have access to CEO images captured by astronauts\non station through the Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth Web site (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov).\nApproximately 700,000 to 800,000 NASA digital photographs of Earth are downloaded by the public each\nmonth. The Web site also features an "Image of the Week" and searchable access to all the photographs.\nScientific analyses using CEO data have been published in scientific journals in a wide variety of\ndisciplines. A few highlights of these publications are summarized here.\nSpatial resolution is a measure of the smallest object that can be resolved by the sensor, or the size of\nthe area on the ground represented by each pixel determined by geometric properties of the altitude of\nthe spacecraft, lens magnification, size of the original image, and look angle. To achieve maximum\npotential spatial resolution, a camera system must capture information at sufficient speed to eliminate the\neffects of relative ground motion. Using handheld motion compensation, station crewmembers have\nachieved a spatial resolution of less than 6 meters in photographs of Earth from ISS. The ISS provides\ngreat potential as a remote-sensing platform capable of providing high-resolution imagery of the Earth\'s\nsurface (Robinson and Evans 2002).\nCEO images captured from ISS of Pacific Ocean atolls (islands consisting of a circular coral reef\nsurrounding a lagoon) allowed for an assessment of spatial resolution on estimates of landscape\nparameters of the atolls. Data gathered indicated that landscape parameter estimates were fairly accurate\nregardless of spatial resolution changes from 5 to 30 meters. This study of ISS imagery showed that\nspatial resolution, as well as spectral resolution, is of equal importance when studying these formations\n(Andrefouet et al. 2003). The most detailed images of Fangatau atoll, taken from ISS, were used to\nmeasure the biomass of the giant clam fishery at Fangatau Atoll with accuracy similar to that obtained\nfrom aerial photography (Andrefouet et al. 2005). Astronaut photographs of reefs in the Indian Ocean\nhave been used as base maps for dive surveys of reef resources in the region (Quod et al. 2002).\n\nExtracting clear water depths from a variety of sources allows the examination and mapping of shallow\nwater from global to local scales. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA) used four sources of data to map shallow water bathymetry near U.S. coral reef areas. These\nincluded the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) on board the OrbView 2 Satellite\n(SeaWiFS, allows global mapping within 1 kilometer pixels), the IKONOS satellite (global mapping within\n4 meters), the Landsat Satellite (global mapping within 30 meter pixels), and handheld photography by\nthe ISS crew (CEO local mapping within 6 meters). A new technique was applied to the blue and green\nbands from astronaut photography, allowing construction of a bathymetry map for Pearl and Hermes reef\nwith accuracies similar to that obtained from IKONOS (Stumpf et al. 2003).\nHigh-resolution astronaut photography collected from station has provided useful data for urban analysis,\nespecially vegetation measurements. The accuracy of the data obtained from the astronaut photographs\nwas similar to the data obtained by satellite remote sensors. The high-resolution astronaut photography\nobtained by the CEO investigation gives insights into vegetation density in urban areas (Stefanov and\nRobinson 2003).\nImagery captured during ISS Expedition 6 by astronaut Don Pettit (example, right) has led to potential\napplications for urban analyses and modeling of cities at night. ISS photographs of cities at night are\nunique because they provide greater spatial resolution than any other source of city light data. Images of\ncities captured at night clearly provide data for urban density modeling and enhancing census estimates\n(Lulla 2003).\nAstronaut handheld imagery acquired since the early 1980\'s, including those from the ISS, has permitted\nthe first global geomorphic survey of megafans. Megafans are partial cones of river sediment usually laid\ndown by a single switching river, characterized by areas on the order of 103 - 105 km2, smooth plains, and\nslopes of <1 degree. Using examples mainly from South America, and based on stream behaviors\ncommon in megafans, models were developed which appear to have implications for the distribution and\ndiversification of aquatic river organisms (Wilkinson 2006).\nResults Status: Pending More Information\nResults Review Status: PI Reviewed\nResults Publications:\nCembella AD, Ibarra DA, Diogene J, Dahl E.
