Bluhm\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nPasadena, California\n\nABSTRACT\nThis paper presents the objectives and implementation plan for the Industrial\nApplication Experiment. Series of the Applications Development element of the\nThermal Power Systems Project. The first experiment its the series will be the\nIndustrial Thermal Module Experiment. The approach to implementing the\nexperiment is presented and an implementation schedule is provided.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Industrial Application Experiment Series will accomplish the deployment of\nexperimental parabolic dish systems into the industrial sector for the purpose\nof providing user, supplier, sponsor, and developer with a realistic\nassessment of system feasibility in selected near-term industrial\napplications. System feasibility, step three in a five step model of the\ncommercialization process,* is the deployment of technologically-ready\ncomponents, properly integrated into working, experimental modules, for\nevaluation in user environments. The modules are not mass-produced. However,\nthe design of the module and components may be compatible with mass production\ntechniques.\n\nOBJECTIVES\nThe objectives of the Industrial Application Experiment Series are.\n1.\n\nVerify that selected parabolic dish systems can produce energy from solar\nradiation to meet the energy requirements of selected industrial\napplications during designated test periods.\n\n2.\n\nDetermine to what extent the parabolic dish systems can be considered\nfirm energy resources for the selected industrial applications during\ndesignated test periods.\n\n*\t\n\nAn adaptation of the commercialization process of the National\nPhotovoltaic Program, the five step process suggested here consists of\ntechnical feasibility of components, technical readiness of components,\nsystem feasibility, system readiness, and commercial readiness.\n\nlsl\t\n\n,,- .

Module Experiment and\nlater through additional experiments involving thermal, electric, and combined\nthermal and electric systems. The approach is to progress through a series of\nsteps, from single-module to multi-module systems, from thermal-only\napplications to more complex combined thermal and electric applications. The\nexperience of other solar thermal experiments, particularly those involving\nparabolic dish hardware, will be utilized to the fullest extent possible in\nexperiment planning and implementation.\n\nINDUSTRIAL THERMAL MODULE EXPERIMENT\nThe Industrial Thermal Module Experiment will accomplish the objectives of the\nIndustrial Application Experiment Series within the limited scope of near-term\nthermal applications, small systems size and existing developed hardware. The\nexperiment will also provide an early stimulus to the collector industry,\nprimarily through the reduction of risk to potential users and, secondarily,\nthrough the purchasing of hardware by the Government.\n\n182\n\nThe uav elements of the approach to the Industrial Thermal Module Experiment\nare;\no\t\n\nRapid deployment of existing technology\n\no\t\n\nSmall, low cost, low risk experiments\n\no\t\n\nNear-term thermal applications\n\no\t\n\nIndustrial user and system suA_p li- ir on contractor team\ni\n\nn\t\n\nIndustrial sites\n\no\t\n\nDeveloped hardware\n\nn\t\n\nVerification testing of systems required prior to deployment\n\no\t\n\nInvolvement of small business\n\nTo accomplish the rapid deployment required for this Experiment, implementation\nis accelerated in each of the five phases of the plan. In the first phase,\nproposal preparation, developed hardware is selected by a prospective\nContractor toam for a thermal application at a particular industrial sate.\nThe second phase, contractor selection, involves identification of site,\nsystem, fiser, and supplier; the level of verification testing required at the\nJPL Parabolic Dish Test Site at Edwards Air Force Base, California, is\nnegotiated. During the design phase, plant design is completed very soon\nafter contract award in order to permit the placement of orders for hardware\nin FY1980. During the fourth phase, verification testing is accomplished at\nthe Parabolic Dish Test Site, if required. Three levels of testing at the\nParabolic Dish Test Site may be required:\n1.\n\nNone: System-level testing has already been completed.\n\n2.\n\nMinimum: A short (two month) test period is needed. No modification to\nthe hardware is necessary. The hardware is then qualified for system\nfeasibility evaluation at the user\'s site.\n\n3.\n\nMaximums Two short test periods are required, the second following\nmodifications to the hardware to correct problems identified as solvable\nthrough minor modifications (requiring two months of downtime).\n\nAt the end of verification testing, a go/no-go decision is made by JPL on\ndeployment of hardware, based on test findings and the recommendation of the\nContractor. During the fifth phase, the system is installed, checked-out,\ntested and evaluated at the user\'s site. Plant installation during FY1981 is\nhighly desirable.\nEarly events in the implementation of the Industrial Thermal Module Experiment\nare scheduled as follows:\n\n183\n\n1.\n2.\n\nCHD Announcement\n\t\nP?P Release\n\n\t\n\nFebruary 1980\nSecond Quarter 1980\n\nOrganizations interested in receiving an R1P should contact:\nMr. Karl Koch\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n11800 Oak Grove Dr., MIS 506-1401\nPasadena, Ca 91103\n\n184\n\n'
