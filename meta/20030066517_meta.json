The purpose of this report is to focus on a variety of issues related to the engine valves and convey the lessons learned. This paper will not delve into detailed technical analysis of the components. None of the lessons learned are new or surprising, but simply reinforce the importance of addressing the details of the design early, at the component level. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Huntsville, Alabama developed the MC-1 engine, a LOX / FW-1, 60,000 pound thrust engine. This engine was developed under the Low Cost Boost Technology office at MSFC and proved to be a very successful project for the MSFC Propulsion team and the various subcontractors working the development of the engine and its components.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030066517, "endDate": "2003-07-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "fb50b39af22745409452123e09957a68", "id": "2b1565dc4bf04f74b15a4782aa97bd2b"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc."}}, "meetingId": "fb50b39af22745409452123e09957a68", "id": "83c097f682154033943a4fef1bf38930"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "fb50b39af22745409452123e09957a68", "id": "3676a3c471c6451ba1fbb0ff155454cf"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "fb50b39af22745409452123e09957a68", "id": "38aa7454510e402581511478dc1fec58"}], "name": "39th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "fb50b39af22745409452123e09957a68", "startDate": "2003-07-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030066517, "id": "59e1566985504f349df12bf753b53cfd", "publicationDate": "2003-05-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030066517.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030066517/downloads/20030066517.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030066517/downloads/20030066517.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030066517/downloads/20030066517.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
