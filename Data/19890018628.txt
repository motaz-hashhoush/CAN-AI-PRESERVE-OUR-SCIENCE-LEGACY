The system is demonstrated on a speckle interferometer, measuring the rigid-body translation\nof a diffusely reflecting object with an accuracy of =lo", or roughly 215 nm.

INTRODUCTION\nSpeckle interferometry is a technique which measures deformations of diffusely\nreflecting objects using low spatial resolution detect0rs.l It is difficult to accurately interpolate between the resultant interferometric fringes, so phase-stepping\ntechniques have been applied to speckle interferometry to provide direct digital processing of the phase measurements.2 The accuracy of these measurements can be limited by phase stepping error^.^ The phase modulator, usually a mirror mounted on a\npiezoelectric transducer, must first be calibrated, a procedure frequently complicated by transducer nonlinearity and hysteresis, as well as sensitivity drift caused\nby temperature fluctuations and changes in the optical layout. Nonuniform mirror\nmotion, which causes the magnitude of the phase steps to vary as a function of position, is another common error source. Open-loop phase s t e p p i n g s y s t e m s a r e a l s o subject to errors caused by random phase variations produced by vibration, temperature\nfluctuations, and air currents.\nThis paper describes a phase-stepping speckle interferometer based on a highly accurate closed-loop phase-stepping system which uses a synchronous phase detection technique4 and an all-fiber optical system5 as described in Ref. 6 . This phase control\ntechnique compensates for both phase modulator errors and random phase shifts caused\nby environmental disturbances of the optical fibers. The single-mode optical fibers\nprovide spatially uniform phase fronts and a flexible optical delivery system. The\nphase-stepping speckle interferometer is used to measure the out-of-plane deflection\nof an aluminum blade. The measurements indicate the direction as well as the magnitude of displacement, and are made without using a pneumatically mounted vibration\nisolation table, demonstrating the stability that can be achieved with this system.\nThe experimental apparatus is described first, followed by the method of data acquisition. Finally, phase measurements showing the displacement of an object are presented as phase maps, histograms and plots.\n\nI\n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\nA schematic of the optical system is shown in Fig. 1. The entire system is mounted\non a honeycomb optical table without pneumatic vibration dampening. The dashed line\n\nrepresents an enclosure built around the speckle interferometer to reduce the effects\nof air turbulence.\nThe object under study (OBJ) is a metal blade covered with retroreflective tape to\nincrease its reflectivity. The object is mounted on a piezoelectrically-driven\ntranslation stage (PZT3) to provide object displacement along the axis shown by the\ndouble-headed arrow. Light from a fiber (Fobj) illuminates the object, which is\nimaged with unity magnification through a 120 mm lens (L2) onto a 120 by 120 pixel\ncharge-injection-device camera (CID). An aperture ( A ) is stopped down to approximately f/60, creating image-plane speckles larger than the camera\'s 28 1 ~ mdetector\nelements. To maximize the reflected light that passes through the aperture, the\nobject is placed so that its normal bisects a, the 40" angle that the object beam\nmakes with the camera\'s optical axis.\nLight emitted from another fiber (Fref) serves as a reference wavefront and is\ndiverted to the camera by a 50:50 beamsplitting cube (BS). A lens/pinhole combination (L3/PH) creates a spatially filtered spherical wave which, to the camera,\nappears to originate from aperture A . The distances between each output fiber face\nand the camera are equal to within the 2 cm coherence length of the argon ion laser.\nThe fiber optic system shown in Fig. 1 serves as a light delivery system for the\nspeckle-interferometer and also provides for hig\'nly accurate phase stepping. Light\nfrom an argon ion laser operating at 514.5 run is coupled through a lens (L1) into\none leg (Fin) of a variable-ratio fiber-optic coupler (FC). This light is split\ninto the path length matched LO m long output fibers F,bj\nand Fref used in the\nspeckle interferometer. These fibers are single-mode nonpolarization-preserving\nfibers. Each output fiber is wrapped tightly around a piezoelectric transducer\n(PZTL and PZT2) forming a fiber optic phase-controller on each arm of the interferometer. A portion of the light traveling through each output fiber is reflected at\nthe fiber\'s end face, and travels back through the coupler. The reflected light\nfrom each fiber combines interferometrically within the fourth leg of the fiberoptic coupler (Fsig) and is detected by a photodiode (PD). Defining the one-way\nphase delay of the light traveling through fibers Fobj and Fref to be 8,bj\nand eref respectively, the current generated by PD can be described as:\nipD = KPD Io[1 + m cos(2eref\n\n-\n\n2eobj)l\n\n(1)\n\nwhere K ~ D is the sensitivity of the photodetector, Io is the mean detected intensity, and m is the fringe visibility. A 10 kHz sicusoidal voltage applied to PZT1\nmodulates ipD for synchronous detection by the closed-loop phase-control system;\nthe modulated current is described by:\nIo{l\nipD = K ~ D\nwhere 8 = (eref - eobj), and 13\nphase modulation, respectively.\n\n+ m cos[28 - 23 sin(wt)l}\n1\n\nand w\n\n(2)\n\nare the amplitude and frequency of the\n\nA block diagram of the phase-control system is shown in Fig. 2 . An oscillator ( O S C )\ngenerates the modulation signal which drives PZTL. A lock-in amplifier (LOCK-IN)\n\n2\n\nt\n\ncompares the amplified signal from PD to the oscillator\'s driving frequency and\ngenerates a voltage (El) which is described by:6\n\nm\nwhere C = KLI K m p KPD Io m J 1 ( 2 p ) , KLI is the gain of the lock-in amplifier, K p\nis the sensitivity of the current-to-voltage converter preamp, and J1() is the first\norder Bessel function. An integrator (INTI and a high-voltage amplifier (AMP) integrate and amplify E1 for use as an error signal. This error signal drives PZT2,\nchanging the optical path length of Fref until E1 is nulled. When E1 is\nnulled, 0 equals either 0" or 180", depending on initial conditions. Changing the\nloop polarity allows 0 to be set to 90" or 270".6 This sign change is accomplished\nwith a computer controlled switch (SW2).\nIn order to select between the two allowable values of 8, the initial conditions can be set by temporarily deactivating the\nfeedback loop with a switch (SW1) and applying an offset voltage to PZTL to coarsely\nstep the phase to the desired value, and then reactivating the phase-control system\nwithin 20 msec to lock onto and maintain the correct phase setting. This computercontrolled offset voltage is applied with a digital-to-analog converter (D/A). In\nthis way, the relative phase between the light at the output fiber faces can be set\nto any multiple of go", i.e., 0 = (n - 1) ( 9 0 " ) where n = 1, 2, 3, or 4 . The root\n,\nmean square phase step error was determined to be 0.02" by measuring the standard\ndeviation in E1 and using Eq. (3).6\n\n3 . DATA ACQUISITION\n\nThe out-of-plane displacement of the object was measured using the fiber optic phasestepping interferometer. A voltage applied to PZT3 moved the object along the\noptical axis as shown by the double-headed arrow in Fig. 1. The phase of the light\nreflected off the surface of the object relative to the reference wave was measured\nbefore and after the object was translated, and a phase map y(x,y) was calculated\nshowing the out-of-plane component of the distance that the object moved.\n\nIn order to measure the phase of the light reflected off of the object relative to\nthe reference wave, four images were acquired by the CID camera with the relative\nphase 8 stepped by 90" between exposures. The intensity field detected by the C I D\ncamera can be described as:\nIn(x,y> = Io(x,y){l\n\n+ m(x,y)cos[y(x,y>\n\n+ en11\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Io(x,y) is the average intensity detected by pixel (x,y>, m(x,y> is the Corresponding visibility, and @ ( x , y >is the relative phase of the object and reference\nwaves caused by optical path differences between the output fibers\' end faces and the\ncamera. Four intensity maps In(x,y) are recorded while the object was in a reference position, and then four more were recorded after the object had been moved.\nThe intensity maps were stored on a desktop computer via an eight-bit A/D card.\nPhase stepping and object translation were computer controlled, while an operator\nacquired images after each phase step. In order to provide adequate operator\nresponse time, there was a 5 sec pause between each phase step. A 10 sec delay was\nincluded to move the object and allow it to settle, for a total acquisition time of\n60 sec. No attempt was made to minimize this time; 1/30 sec for each frame capture\nand perhaps a 1 sec pause for object translation could reduce this time to less than\n3 sec.\n\n3\n\nThe relative phase\nstepping relation:\'\n\nQ(X,Y)\n\nis determined at each pixel by using the standard phase-\n\nThe phase at a give point was calculated only if the signal modulation (2IOm)\nexceeded a threshold Cth where:8\n\nand the threshold constant Cth was chosen to minimize the deviation in the calculated phase cp while maximizing the number of valid pixels.\n4 . RESULTS\n\nAt each validated point, the initial phase was subtracted from the final phase to\ndetermine the phase difference AW representing the motion of the object caused by\nvoltage applied to PZT3. Figure 3 shows the phase difference measured across the\n120 by 120 pixel array when 19.2 V was applied to PZT3. The threshold constant\nCth was set to 1/20 o f the saturation intensity. The shaded pixels show the structure of the recorded speckle pattern; the level of grey indicates the value of Acp.\nBlack areas represent invalid pixels. Slightly fewer than one-half of the pixels\nwere considered invalid, primarily because more than one speckle was present at\nthose pixels.\nThe phase shifts calculated at each pixel are shown in Fig. 4 as histograms for each\nof four voltages applied to PZT3. This data shows that the object moved away from\nthe detector when a voltage was applied, 360" represents no motion and 0" indicates\na displacement of X / [ 2 cos2(a/2)] away from the detector. The widths of these histograms show that the uncertainty in the measured phase across the surface of the\nblade is about 10" rms. The average phase steps across the detector array were computed from the histograms. These average phase steps were measured eight times at\neach of nine voltages applied to PZT3. This data plotted in Fig. 5 shows that the\nerror in the repeated measurement of the displacements was 6 . 8 " on the average, and\nwas as large as 1 4 " . The data was fit to a straight line and had a correlation coefficient of 0.988, showing that PZT3 was only approximately linear over the region\nthat it was traversed. One data point lies far off of the general curve. This was\nthe only point which passed the modulation threshold and yielded an incorrect measurement, in fact, the histogram for this point was very narrow. The most likely\nexplanation for this erroneous point is operator error, probably caused b y acquiring\nan image at the wrong time. Four of the 72 phase measurements were corrected for a\n180" phase stepping error. This error can be caused by any disturbance which alters\nthe phase 8 by more than 180" during the 20 msec that the phase control system is\nunder open-loop control.\nWhen nonrigid-body translation is to be measured, the phase at a single pixel can be\ntracked. Figure 6 shows the phase measured as a function of applied voltage for\nthree randomly selected pixels. Although only three pixels are shown, all of the\nvalid pixels show the same trend.\n\n4\n\n5 . CONCLUSION\n\nA fiber optic phase stepping interferometer was demonstrated by measuring the out-ofplane motion of a rigid body with 210" accuracy without using a pneumatically mounted\noptical table. This system\'s inherent advantages include the flexibility of a fiber\noptic based optical configuration and the accuracy of closed-loop phase control.\n6. REFEREXCES\n\n1. R. Jones and C.
