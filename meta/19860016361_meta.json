Examples of differential stiffness are the stiffening effects of gravity forces in a pendulum, centrifugal forces in rotor blades and pressure loading of shell structures. In cases wherein this stiffness caused by a load is destabilizing, the differential stiffness concept lends itself to nonlinear structural analysis. Rigid Formats 4 (static analysis with differential stiffness) and 13 (normal modes with differential stiffness) are specifically designed to account for such stiffness changes. How pressure loading may be treated in these rigid formats is clarified. This clarification results from modal correlation of Ground Vibration Test (GVT) results from the empty and pressurized Filament Wound Case (FWC) quarter-scale Space Shuttle solid rocket booster (QSSRB). A sketch of the QSSRB cantilevered to the floor by its external tank attachments is shown.", "title": "Differential stiffness effects", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T17:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860016361, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ujihara, B.
