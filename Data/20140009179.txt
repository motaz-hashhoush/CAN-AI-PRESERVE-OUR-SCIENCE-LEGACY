Only one laser is\noperational at any given time.\nThe test that this presentation\nwill cover is of the LTCS (Laser\nThermal Control System) that\nwas designed to maintain\ntemperature of the operational\nlaser.\n\nTest Setup\n\nICESat-2/ATLAS\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight laser thermal control system, including\nloop heat pipe, constant-conductance heat\npipe, and radiator\n\xe2\x80\x93 Heat pipe and LHP both operating in reflux\n\xe2\x80\x93 The test comprises of thermal masses that have\nsimilar capacitance that of the flight lasers.\n\nRadiator\n\nRadiator\n\nCCHP GSE Heater\n\nTCU 2\nLHP\nLTCS Assembled with ATLAS\n\nTCU 1\nLTCS Test Setup\n\nS\nh\nr\no\nu\nd\n\nICESat-2/ATLAS\n\nTest Setup\n\nRadiator\n\nLTCS Support\nFrame\n\nCC (Reservoir)\nThermal Mass 2\nThermal Mass 1\n\nCCHP\n\nEvaporator\n5\n\nICESat-2/ATLAS\n\nTest Setup\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Radiator views shroud surface and all other\ncomponents are blanketed with SLI (Single Layer\nInsulation).
