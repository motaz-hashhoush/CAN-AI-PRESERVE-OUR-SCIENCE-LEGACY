The observation of\nmainly geologically young ages for the Martian meteorites, the only exception being the ~4.5 Ga\nALH84001 [1], is paradoxical when viewed in context\nof a Martian surface thought to be mostly much older\nas inferred from the surface density of meteorite craters [2]. There appears to be at least a twofold difference between the observed ages of Martian meteorites\nand their expected ages as inferred from the ages of\nMartian surfaces obtained from crater densities.\nRecently determined meteorite ages: The crystallization ages of several additional Martian meteorites\nhave been determined since the previous summary [1].\nMeteorites for which ages (in Ma) have been determined by the Sm-Nd method include the depleted\nshergottites Y980459 (472\xc2\xb147 [3]) and NWA1195\n(348\xc2\xb119 [4]), basaltic shergottite NWA 856 (171\xc2\xb110\n[5]), nakhlites Yamato 000593 (1310\xc2\xb130 [6]) and Mil\n03346 (1356\xc2\xb130 [7]), and chassignite NWA2737\n(1416\xc2\xb157 [8]). Additionally, new, higher precision\nSm-Nd ages have been redetermined for Chassigny\n(1380\xc2\xb130 [9]), lherzolite Yamato 793605 (156\xc2\xb114\n[10]), and basaltic shergottite NWA1460 (345\xc2\xb114\n[11]). Essentially concordant Rb-Sr ages also have\nbeen determined for NWA 856 (161\xc2\xb15 [5]), Y000593\n(1300\xc2\xb120 [6]), Mil 03346 (1294\xc2\xb1122, [7]), Y793605\n(173\xc2\xb114 [12], and NWA 1460 (336\xc2\xb114 [11]). New,\nconcordant 39Ar-40Ar ages also have been determined\nfor the nakhlites Y000593 (1359\xc2\xb120 [6]) as well as for\nChassigny (1338\xc2\xb115 [9]). All of the ~175 Ma basaltic\nshergottites and lherzolites have significantly higher\n39\nAr-40Ar ages than the corresponding Rb-Sr and/or\n\nSm-Nd ages due to the presence of excess 40Ar. Because the 39Ar-40Ar ages cited here have been corrected\nfor cosmogenic Ar as well as for trapped Martian atmospheric Ar, some excess 40Ar must have been present in the parental magmas. Although it might be argued that Sm-Nd ages rely heavily on phosphate\nanalyses [13], this is not true of Rb-Sr and 39Ar-40Ar\nages. Rb-Sr mineral isochrons are determined by lowRb/Sr plagioclase and relatively high-Rb/Sr pyroxene\nand/or melt inclusions in pyroxene, whereas 39Ar-40Ar\nages are determined nearly totally by decay of 40K in\nplagioclase. Thus, the suggestion that the ages may\nhave been reset by percolating fluids [13] cannot apply\nto the Rb-Sr and 39Ar-40Ar ages.\nSr and Nd isotopic heterogeneity in Zagami:\nIn spite of overwhelming evidence for young ages\nof the Martian meteorites, complexities affecting interpretions of their ages long have been apparent. The\ndistinct discordance between Rb-Sr and 39Ar-40Ar ages\nof Shergotty led [14] and [15] to suggest that the ages\nwere reset by post-shock thermal events. The observation of fine- and coarse-grained lithologies in Zagami\n[16] inspired an experiment to test for subsolidus isotopic reequilibration. Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isochrons\nwere simultaneously determined for both lithologies\n[17]. The resulting isochrons are shown in Figs. 1 and\n2. If resetting were diffusion-controlled, it would have\nbeen more completely achieved for the fine-grained\nlithology, but the opposite is observed. This result appears to be evidence that differences in the isotopic\ncomposition of relict crystals in a magma mush were\nincompletely homogenized. Differences were frozen\ninto more rapidly crystallizing fine-grained lithology.\nLaunch pairing: Cosmic ray exposure ages com-\n\nBasaltic shergottite - Zagami\n\nBasaltic shergottite - Zagami\n\nPx2\n3.55-3.7\n\nFine-grained\nT=174\xc2\xb114 Ma\nI(Sr)=0.72233\xc2\xb114\n\nNd\n\nPlag\n<2.85(r)\n\nPx1\n3.45-3.55\n\nWR\nPlag\n0.722\n<2.85(l) <2.85\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n\xce\xb5Nd=-7.7\xc2\xb10.5\n\nNd/\n\nPlag WR\n0.5116 <2.85\n\nCoarse-grained\nT=163\xc2\xb119 Ma\nI(Sr)=0.72179\xc2\xb124\n\nT=163\xc2\xb17 Ma\n\n\xce\xb5Nd=-5.9\xc2\xb10.2\nT=198\xc2\xb121 Ma\n\n0.5115\nPlag <2.85 (r)\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n87\n\n2.0\n\nPx1\n3.45-3.55\n\n144\n\nPx2\n3.55-3.7\n0.724\n\nPx2\n3.55-3.7\n\nCG Nd+\n\nT=472\xc2\xb1106 Ma\n\n0.726\n\nWR\n\nFG Nd+\n\n0.5117\n\n143\n\n87\n\n0.5118\n\nPx1\n3.45-3.55\n\n86\n\nSr/ Sr\n\n0.728\n\n2.5\n\n86\n\nRb/ Sr\n\nFigure 1.

[18] identified up to 8 ejection\nevents at 0.7, 1.2, 2.8, 4.1, 10.8, 11.3, 15, and 20 Ma\nago for EET79001, olivine-phyric shergottites, basaltic\nshergottites, lherzolitic shergottites, nakhlites (10.8 Ma\n), Chassigny (11.3 Ma), ALH84001, and Dhofar 019,\nrespectively. In constructing their Fig, 1, they used the\n10\nBe exposure age of 1.1 Ma [19] for olivine-phyric\nYamato 980459 rather than a well-substantiated 21Ne\nexposure age of 2.9 Ma. The longer 21Ne age was attributed to pre-exposure on the Martian surface, an\nimportant example of pre-exposure. The crystallization\nages of basaltic and lherzolitic shergottites are the\nsame within error limits (cf. Fig. 3), and they may have\ncome from the same event if pre-exposure of some of\nthe lherzolites is allowed. EETA79001 shares the\nsame ~175 Ma crystallization age, suggesting it also\nmay have been launched at the same time, but requiring secondary breakup in space. Finally, the ~330-340\nMa old basaltic shergottites QUE94201 and NWA\n1460 share very similar ejection ages of 2.7\xc2\xb10.2 Ma\n[1], and ~2.6 Ma [19] with ~175 Ma old basaltic shergottites like Zagami (2.8\xc2\xb10.3 Ma [18]). All may have\nbeen ejected together from ~340 Ma old terrain.\nMeteorite ages compared to surface ages: There\nare a variety of reasons why the meteorite ages may\nnot be representative of Martian surface ages. The observed lack of impact melt near terrestrial impact craters in sedimentary rock [20] is significant in this regard. Because most Martian sedimentary rocks occur\nin units of Hesperian age (K. Tanaka, p. comm.), this\neffect, as well as other hypothesized factors biasing the\nCrystallization and Ejection Ages of Martian Meteorites\n\nCrystallization Age (Ga)\n\n5\n\nA84\n\nHartmann & Neukum (2001)\nHesperian/Noachian\nEarly Amazonian\n\n1\n0.5\n\nMid Amazonian\n\nNakhlites & Chassigny\nDho\n\nDaG, Y98\nNWA 1195\n\n480/1460, QUE\n\nLate Amazonian\nEET\n\n0.1\n0.5\n\n1068\n\nLocal Stratigraphy?\n\nA77, LEW, Y79\nBU\nPE\nZag, She, LA, 856\n\n5\n\n1\n\n10\n\n20\n\nEjection Age (Ma)\nBasaltic shergottites\n\nDunite (Chassigny)\n\nLherzolitic shergottites\n\nOrthopyroxenite\n\nClinopyroxenites (Nakhlites)\n\nFigure 3.

However, Hartmann and\nNeukum [2] set the Hesperian/Amazonian boundary\nbetween 2.9 Ga ago (Hartmann system) and 3.3 Ga\nago (Neukum system), so even if launches are restricted to the Amazonian, multiple launches should\nhave given some meteorites from the oldest Amazonian terrain; i.e., ~3 Ga old. Thus, the upper limit of\n1.4 Ga for Martian meteorites exclusive of ALH84001\nsuggests a mismatch of a factor two between radiometric and cratering ages (cf. Fig. 3).\nA 4.0 Ga age for shergottites? 207Pb-206Pb isotopic data for some basaltic shergottites have been\ninterpreted as showing an old, ~4.0 Ga crystallization\nage for them [13]. This interpretation arises from (a)\nexcluding the Pb isotopic data for magmatic phosphates from the isochron regression, (b) variable initial\nPb isotopic compositions in acid resistant minerals,\nand/or (c) terrestrial contamination [11]. Much of the\nPb isotopic data for shergottites are for the major minerals, pyroxene and plagioclase, in the plentiful ~175\nMa basaltic shergottites. The Pb isotopic composition\nin these minerals of low U/Pb ratios is nearly unevolved from the initial Pb present when the rocks\nformed. Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cisochrons\xe2\x80\x9d obtained by combining Pb\nisotopic analyses of these mineral phases from different meteorites are \xe2\x80\x9cmantle isochrons\xe2\x80\x9d reflecting the\ninitial ~4.5 Ga differentiation of Mars, not shergottite\nemplacement.\nReferences: [1] Nyquist L.
