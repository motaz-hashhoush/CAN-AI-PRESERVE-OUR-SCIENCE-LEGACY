b"C\n\nPERSPECTIVE\nAlexander\n\n- TECHNOLOGY\nJ. Tuyahov\n\nTRANSFER\n\nPROGRAM\n\n(Chief - Space Applications Development\nBranch/Technology\nTransfer - NASA\nHeadquarters)\n\nIt is a pleasure to be here.\nWhat I will try to do today is give you\na national perspective of where we stand with the status of the technology transfer program and also to talk about the future as well as\nsome of the things that Sue Norman spoke about.\n\nWe have essentially three regional applications centers.\nThey are involved in 91 application projects within 22 states.\nThis is our technology dissemination\nfunction.\nWe also have approximately\neight application system verification transfer projects.\nThese are technology\nverification\nefforts involving those types of organizations.\n\nWe have approximately\n21 university applications branches to develop\ncapacity in the academic community in space applications.\nSeventeen\nbranches are involved in remote sensing, and we have some basic discipline centers now being started.\nFor the last four years, we have\ninstitutionalized\nliaison activities with public interest groups, such\nas the National Congress of State Legislatures,\nthe National Governor's\nAssociation\nand others.\nWe also have user requirements activities that\nconduct user needs studies through our NASA field centers in cooperation\nwith user panels, and conduct conferences, symposiums and other liaison\nactivities.\n\nThere are many ways to talk about technology transfer programs but I\nthought I would go through it in a chronological\nsense.\nThat is, how\ndid it evolve?\nBefore I do that, let me give you a breakdown as to\nwhere we work primarily in technology transfer.\n\nMany\n\nactivities\n\nconcern\n\nthe area of land use for various\n\npurposes,\n\nsuch\n\nas development,\nsuitability and planning.\nAnother large area is in\nforestry, range and wildlife, the whole aspect of forest inventory and\nother types of vegetation inventories.\nThen we have two major other\nareas in agricultural-related\nand water resources activities.\nMost\nof our activities are in these four areas.\nThe remaining activities,\nthe materials processing for our university applications programs, R&D,\ngeology activities, geodynamics and coastal zones.\n\nNASA became involved with technology transfer\nwas launched in July 1972.\nThe first efforts\n\n1-8\n\nprimarily after Landsat\nwere investigation\nefforts.\n\nWe have had 327 Landsat investigations,\n119 Landsat II investigations.\nThese primarily were directed at the university community, although\nother users were involved.\nWe first became involved in technology\ntransfer through the university applications programs, which were\nformed in 1971.\nTheir purpose was to develop a capacity in the nation\nfor applying space applications technology.\nThat has been going on\never since.\nWe have worked with about 30 universities with an emphasis\non remote sensing.\nNow, we are developing an emphasis of understanding\ndisciplines such as geology - what do you need to measure in geology\nand what observables do you need to measure from space for future\nsystems?\n\nAs to the status of our university applications program, we have worked\nwith 31 universities since 1971.\nWe initiated three programs in 1980.\nWe will not be initiating any in 1981 due to budget problems.\n\nIn our branch activities, we have essentially, three major functions.\nFirst, we try to develop a capacity in the university for applying space\napplications.\nSecond, we try to develop an educational process so that\na cadre of people will evolve in the future that know remote sensing as\nit can be applied from civil engineering, geology, etc.\nThe third is\ntechnology transfer.\nThese are the subsets of those types of activities.\nThat is what the grants are for.\n\nEach university is normally funded for about five or six years to develop\nenough momentum to get a center going at that university.\nThey may have\n40 to 50 projects at that university.\nFor example, the University of\nNebraska started on irrigated lands inventory in 1973.\nPivot irrigation\nwas using a lot of fuel and the project was conducted to develop planning\ndata for people who are distributing\nthe fuel positioning storage tanks,\netc.\nIn this case, the univeristy developed a map of irrigated lands\nand became independent.\nThe state started funding this.\nI have had\na growing demand for this type of very simple map for the agri business\ncommunity, petroleum community, the state agency and so forth.\nWe try\nto get the university started, develop an area of expertise in space\napplications and then spin them off independently.\nIn most cases, we\nhave been successful in doing that.\n\nOur first program focused on university applications.\nThe purpose was\nto develop capacity with work primarily in the academic area.\nFollowing\nthat, we realize things were proven out - technology was proven - we had\nto work more with end users.\nIn 1974, the Applications\nSystems Verification Transfer program was developed to work with end users, in an attempt\nto transfer and verify that technology in the users own home setting.\nWe looked at the economics of the applications and what kind of adaptive\nengineering has to be done to make it work in a real environment.\n\ni-9\n\nWe have approximately\neight or nine ASVT's.\nSome of these have been\ncompleted.\nWe are working with the National Park Service right now\ncompleting an ASVT program in identifying such things as fire hazard\nareas and tailoring information products to that particular customer.\nThey are developing a center in Denver and preparing equipment for a\nLandsat data analysis facility.\nWe are also working with the State of\nAlaska in a multi-disciplinary\nactivity involving some federal and state\nagencies and the State of California, involving vertical data integration, working with counties in this state and private industry.\nOne\nof our ASVT's is with sub-state government.\nThe Florida Water Management District.\nThis project is primarily aimed at ecological problems\nin Florida.\nFor example, the withdrawal of fresh water from the Swanee\nRiver and what impact does it have on the estuarine.\nThe PNW which\nyou will hear a lot about, in a multi-disciplinary\nproject.\n\nWe finished a project with the Corps of Engineers, involving water mapping in support of the Dam Safety Act.\nWe have completed a project with\nthe Appalachian Regional Commission to identify gas deposits.\nThe\nAppalachian Regional Commission is going to drill so we will know the\nreal result of this ASVT.\nWe do not know the results until something is\nfound or not found.\nWe are going through that process now.\nIn addition,\nwe worked with 13 agencies in the State of Texas, and conducted snow\ncover mapping with the Corps.\nWe are working through Ames with the\npublic utilities to determine power demand and power line citing.\n\nOne example involves the National Park Management project.\nWe have a\nformat here of presenting a problem and solution.\nThe key in using\nLandsat is geobased information systems.\nThis project is a good example\nof using Landsat in combination with other data.\n\nJust to illustrate something that is very typical of all our projects,\nwe had a Landsat Project which provided us with nine group land cover\nclassifications.\nThen, through adding elevation and aspect data, we\nwere able to get 21 land cover categories.\nThis is over Olympic park.\nThen by adding slope, we produced what the user wanted, a fire hazard\nmap.\nThis is rather typical of all our projects by combining remote\nsensing with a geobased information system approach.\n\nI am not going to talk too much about the regional program since you\nare already most familiar with this.\nThe program's purpose was primarily\nto aid state and local users in a very organized national scale of the\ndissemination\ndemonstration\nactivity.\nThe 1976 administration\npolicy\nreview affirmed that we needed a program to address state and local\nneeds.\nThere was a study that said NASA is great if you have technology\nup there obiting\n\nthe earth and providing\n\nI-I0\n\ndata,\n\nbut you have\n\nto teach\n\nusers how to use it. We had a 10t of congressional\ntestimony.\nOut of\nthis came a commitment for a regional program to address local and\nregional problems in a unique way.\nWe formed the regional applications\nprogram.\n\nWe have the nation categorized in three regions, with a distinct responsibility that each center has for all the states.\nPrior to this,\nwe had an informal regional program.\nOne of the problems we faced was\nthat several NASA centers might be talking to one state, and a lot of\nconfusion resulted.\nOne of the reasons for developing this program was\nto eliminate that.\n\nWe had universities\nto build a long term Capacity, ASVDs to verify\ntechnology dissemination\nfor the regional program - user requirements\nand awareness and we are looking to determine what needs to be done\nin the future to see how NASA R&D will develop and progress.\nOne successful program in accomplishing\nthis involves our relationship with\nNCSL, NGA and the National Association of Counties.\n\nWe are conducting user requirement studies in the field center in support of that.\nAfter the user needs are determined - areas of deep\neconomic uses - we conduct feasibility studies to determine if something will work in a particular area.\nThe utilities project was started\nin that way to determine if the technology is feasible in this particular\nindustry.\nAfter completion of that, we normally phase into the ASVT\nprogram.\nWe are working with a national innovation network on American\nlandscape, the Architects Association.\nDuring the last year weworked\nwith NOAA.\nOne example is this conference co-sponsored with NOAA.\n\nOn 10 March 1981, President Reagan sent to congress the new administration budget for FY 82 and a revised budget for FY 81. They contain\nsignificant changes for our program.\nThe President'sbudget\nhas the\nobjective of reducing federal expenditures as well as improving and\ntrying to revive the economy.\nTherefore they eliminate programs that\ncompeted with the private sector or provided a partial or what the\nadministration\nconsidered an unnecessary subsidy to users who should\npay for this service.\nThis is some of the philosophy that was used\ntoward technology transfer.\nTechnology transfer was cut throughout\nthe federal government.\nVery few federal technology transfer programs\nsurvived because the administration\nconsidered these programs\nthat\nshould be carried out and funded by the private sector.\nOne of the\nrecommended cuts in the Reagan budget was to phase out and terminate\nthe regional programs - the ASVT and user requirements and awareness\nprograms at the end of FY 81.\nThe university applications program will\nbe phased down and terminated by 1985.\nThe overall implication is that\nthere is a more rapid phase-out of the federal government's role in\n\ni-ii\n\nremote sensing with more reliance on the private sector.\nThe private\nsector should do a lot of things that'we are doing now.\nThere will be\na reduction in the low risk opportunity that has been offered to programs, such as the regional program.\nWe will try to put a lot of\nemphasis during the next six months on documentation\nand techniques,\nand make it available to the private sector.\nWe will review the ongoing projects in the next month and develop a strategy.\nEssentially,\nwe will complete all our present project commitments, phasing down\nsome projects prematurely.\nNo additional projects will be started\nand no continuous assistance provided.\n\nThere has been a substantial user development completed.\nWe have conducted demonstration\nprojects in 36 states.\nWe have trained more than\n2,000 state, university and federal officials.\nDepending upon how you\ndefine the word operational,\n15 states are in operational status.\nWe\nhave good university centers of expertise in 20 states.\n\nThe NCSL and NGA developed a national network for communicating with\nstates in the remote sensing field.\nWe have also had cooperative\nprojects with federal agencies and have developed interest and appreciation of remote sensing in state programs.\nAll these things in combination with an emerging private sector industry slowly will enable this\nwhole process to be carried out independently,\nor with less involvement\nwith the federal government.\n\nNASA will continue working with the\nan applications\ndevelopment capacity\nadministration way.\nAlthough there\nfeel we have made a tremendous start\nmonths to one year will tell us what\nprocess takes place.\n\n1-12\n\nuser more in an R&D capacity and\nand not in a national scale of\nis much more that could be done, I\nwith the users.\nThe next six\nwill happen as the congressional\n\n"
