b'SUMMARY REPORT OF THE\nAIRCRAFT DESIGN COMMITTEE\nRobert J. Woodcock\nPrincipal Scientist\nControl Criteria Branch\nFlight Control Division\nAir Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory\n\nMembers of the Aircraft Design Committee and their\nprincipal background in aircraft design were:\nRobert J. Woodcock (Chairman), Air Force\nFlight Dynamics Laboratory, flying qualities\nArthur E . Kressly, Douglas Aircraft Company,\nstability and control\nJohn C. Houbolt, NASA/Langley Research Center,\natmospheric models and structural analysis\nJack Hinkleman, FAA, Systems Research & Development Service\nDouglas E. Guilbert, Aeronautical\nSystems Division, Staff Meteorologist\nMeetings were held with the four "rotating committees"\nfor interchanges based on a list of suggested questionsprovided\nto stimulate discussion.\nConsiderable interest was also shown in aircraft\noperations. First, design must be based on operational\nmethods and problems. Aircraft design for the worst atmospheric disturbances is an impossibility. Instead, the most\nextreme cases must be predicted and avoided. In particular,\nthere are limits on the magnitude of wind shear and (at\nleast for transports and such low-load-factor aircraft)\nthunderstorm turbulence that can be designed for.

Communication problems,\ni n c l u d i n g language d i f f e r e n c e s , have been noted among\ne n g i n e e r s , m e t e o r o l o g i s t s and operators- - and even among\nengineers of v a r i o u s d i s c i p l i n e s .\nDiscussions g e n e r a l l y were l i v e l y . There w a s some\nconsensus, b u t a l s o much domination by a few who were most\nfamiliar with a p a r t i c u l a r subject\nStructures\nThe f i r s t two q u e s t i o n s concerned s t r u c t u r a l design f o r\nt u r b u l e n c e : adequacy of engineering procedures, t h e i r form,\nand t h e d a t a b a s e . The concern expressed w a s f o r methods\nt h a t could be a p p l i e d t o new concepts f o r which p a s t r u l e s\nof thumb might n o t a p p l y , b u t keeping t h e requirements\nf l e x i b l e enough t o allow d i f f e r e n t design approaches as\nwarranted. I t s t i l l has n o t been completely determined t h a t\np r e s e n t c r i t e r i a a r e adequate f o r a l l composite s t r u c t u r e s ,\nw i t h l a r g e r d e f e l c t i o n s , d i f f e r e n t f r e q u e n c i e s and modes\npossible.\nOne problem i s t h e age of t h e o l d s t a n d a r d s , some over\nf o r t y y e a r s o l d . N w c r i t e r i a c a n \' t be r e t r o f i t t o a i r c r a f t\ne\ndesigns a l r e a d y c e r t i f i c a t e d . And because t h e b a s i s i s\naccumulated experience, o l d requirements, such as t h e\n75 f t / s e c design g u s t , cannot be a p p l i e d w i t h confidence t o\nr a d i c a l l y new designs. Even t h e von Karman and Dryden g u s t\ns p e c t r a go back t o t h e 1 9 3 0 \' s . A t l e a s t t h e numbers should\nbe s e l f - c o n s i s t e n t . Some d i s p u t e remains on t h e e x a c t shape\nof t h e power spectra a t low frequency. Houbolt, i n\nI.\n\n276\n\nparticular, prefers the power spectral approach over use\nof discrete gusts. For linear systems, the former can get\nthe same results as easily, and do more too--for example,\nuncover the high-response modes. He would use a design\nenvelope for strength, mission analysis for fatigue.\nAway from the ground, available design methods are\ngenerally adequate for consideration of atmospheric disturbances; any question would be about their application.\nExceptions are a poor understanding of turbulence nonstationarity, patchiness or intermittency, and the spatial\ndistribution. Houbolt noted that rolling often has accompanied vertical gusts he has experienced, and that in a\nnumber of accidents turbulence has caused one wing to break\noff but not the other. He suggested using an airplane\nfitted with angle of attack and sideslip probes at each wing\ntip and the tail to measure correlations.\nFor structural design, wind shear does not appear to\nbe a problem (Question 5 ) . But more data are needed on\npatchiness.\nA tremendous amount of meteorological data exists which\nhas not been analyzed. But some digging would be required\nto determine the suitability of specific data for a given\npurpose.\nLight aircraft too, the Piper Navajo and Beech 35 were\nmentioned, have had structural failures in turbulence. Of\nthe Part 2 3 airplanes the larger, heavier ones are thought\nto be more susceptible.\nHelicopter and VTOL problems were recognized to be\ncompletely different, and received little attention in the\ndiscussions.\n\n277\nd\n\n11.\n\nF l i g h t Control\n\nUnder Question 3 , concerning turbulence simulation,\nwere discussed f l y i n g q u a l i t i e s and f l i g h t c o n t r o l system\ndesign. Related t o t h i s i s Question 6 , on t h e importance of\nwind shear t o a i r c r a f t f l i g h t c o n t r o l systems. I n t h e l a s t\n100 t o 200 feet of a l t i t u d e , wind shear can cause a hard\nlanding. A t 300 t o 400 f e e t i t can cause an a i r p l a n e t o\nland s h o r t . Knowledge of shear corresponds t o our knowledge\nof g u s t s 25 t o 50 years ago.\nO n approach, a tail- to- headwind shear i s p a r t i c u l a r l y\ntroublesome and a common f r o n t a l encounter. I n o r d e r t o\nmaintain g l i d e s l o p e , less t h r o t t l e w i l l be used anyway with\na constant t a i l w i n d . Then upon e n t e r i n g a decreasing t a i l wind s h e a r , a i r s p e e d tends t o i n c r e a s e because of a i r c r a f t\ni n e r t i a . To avoid overshooting, a p i l o t i s i n c l i n e d (even\ni n s t r u c t e d ) t o t h r o t t l e back more. The r e s u l t i n g decelerat i o n can match t h e wind s h e a r \' s e f f e c t , thus making a i r s p e e d\nf a i r l y constant as long as t h e wind continues t o shear.\nBut below t h e a l t i t u d e a t which t h e shear s t o p s , t h e a i r c r a f t\nw i l l continue t o d e c e l e r a t e , now l o s i n g a i r s p e e d r a p i d l y .\nWith l i m i t e d maximum t h r u s t and engine l a g t o o , t h e p i l o t\nm i 1 1 be hard put t o maintain t h e f l i g h t p a t h . A DC- 10 a t\nBuffalo gained 25 k t a i r s p e e d but then ended up 25 k t slow.\nConfronted with t h i s wind s h e a r , a p i l o t must l i m i t use of\nt h r o t t l e . Shear r a t e t h e n , n o t j u s t t h e instantaneous\nchange, i s important. I n t h e s a m e a l t i t u d e range t h e p i l o t\nmay be switching from instrument t o visual f l i g h t , an a d j u s t ment t h a t may t a k e several seconds t o make.\nThe opinion w a s expressed t h a t unaided, a p i l o t can\nhandle a shear g r a d i e n t no g r e a t e r than 4kt/100 f t , For\n\nautomatic landing c e r t i f i c a t i o n , F A r e q u i r e s simulations\nA\nwith an 8kt/100 f t wind shear g r a d i e n t . Even higher values\nhave been encountered. Associated downdrafts can compound\n\n275\n\nthe problem. Autoland systems are more sensitive than a\npilot, have more data, and so may do better.\nCapt. John Bliss, after a close call on approach, has\ndevised and is patenting a system for onboard use that\nmonitors the changing difference between ground speed and\ntrue airspeed to warn pilots of shear and tailwinds. Some\ncommercial jumbo jets have inertial navigation systems from\nwhich ground speed is available. Doppler radar could be\nused. DME is thought to have too much lag for speed\nmeasurement useful in shears. With no help, present procedures definitely lead to trouble. Pilots need warning from\nthe west side of the airfield when to keep away because\nof eastward-moving fronts.\nGood design criteria are needed for performance margins\nto counter wind shear. Some aircraft have a large pitotstatic error in airspeed indication, which doesn\'t help.\nUp to 9 or 10 m/sec downdrafts have been found near the\nsurface. A representative sample of wind shears which\nencompass expected variations would be a very useful design\nhelp. The need to sample extremes which should be avoided\ngives problems of several sorts. Work is in progress and\nsome data are available, but adequacy could not be assessed.\nTrying to forecast wind shear from synoptic data at seven\nEast-Coast airports is just about impossible. The East Coast\nhas large wind shears. In five or six cases warm fronts\nwere found to be much worse than cold fronts, an apparent\nanomaly, since it is not common to associate severe weather\nwith warm fronts. There are T arrays at Elizabeth and White\nSands and towers at Brookhaven and elsewhere for measurements.\nThere is work by Aeronautical Research Associates of\nPrinceton and University of Oklahoma tor NASA, and at UTSI,\nFrost is measuring flow around and in the wakes of actual\nbuildings, etc., and mapping the flow field throughout the\n\n273\nd\n\nvertical plane. NOAA at Boulder is looking at major fronts\nthat way. Aircraft in service would make excellent wind\nshear and gust probes. But operators fear use of the data\nin violation proceedings; legislation might be needed.\nFor some aircraft a change in approach flap setting\nmight be helpful to alleviate wind shear effects, but this\nis limited to settings for which certification was obtained\n(stopping distance being critical). The DC-9 originally had\nonly 60\' and 25O settings usable, but a 40\' setting now has\nbeen approved.\nFor the take-off, cargo operations have a problem\ndragging out at maximum gross weight. Pulling power back\nfor noise abatement at 1500 ft, before drag reduction, the\nairplane just sits there with no acceleration. This is a\nproblem even with no wind shear, though noise abatement is\nforgotten if a critical performance problem develops. The\ncurrent 3.2% climb gradient on a hot day with all engines is\nmarginal for wind shear. A related concern is that unknowledgeable airport managers may be pressed to emphasize noise\nabatement at the expense of safety.\nWake vortices from aircraft were not much discussed.\nSevere upsets have been experienced, leading to much effort\nat analysis and prediction. Apparently these efforts are\nthought to be sufficient as far as meteorological aspects\nare concerned.\nAnother operational problem, noted by Green of American\nAirlines, has been engine compressor stall in crosswinds on\nthe ground. The cause seems to be insufficient design\nconsideration rather than limited design capability.\nFor flying qualities and flight control design, the\nsame instantaneous spatial distributions of horizontal and\nvertical gusts are needed that are needed for structural\ndesign, and also the characterization of patchiness and\n\n280\n\nintermittency, mentioned earlier, at all altitudes. Near\nthe ground more data are needed on eddy size, spanwise\ngradients, lateral gusts, correlation with wind, etc. These\nare important for both analysis and simulation. For\nexample, recent work at NASA Langley has shown deteriorating\npilot ratings of aircraft flying qualities as the turbulence\n\'simulation becomes more sophisticated.\nThunderstorms, downdrafts, etc., combine both design\nand operational problems in finding suitable aircraft\nlimits and ways to avoid exceeding them. The data appear\nto be available and avoidance work is in progress. This\ncommittee wants to emphasize the need. A coordinating panel\nwas suggested to guide the work.\nExtreme gusts can be avoided by staying clear of storms\nwith 40 db or greater radar reflectivity, although the most\nintense gusts may be ten to fifteen miles from the point at\nwhich reflectivity is highest. Faced with a 200 mile squall\nline, then, a private pilot had better wait or go completely\naround it. Doppler, however, can do better for large\naircraft .\nDurrett noted one operational problem with thunderstorms\nfor the space shuttle. A 1%-hour lead is needed for de-orbit\nand return to Kennedy Space Center, but there a thunderstorm\ncan build from a clear sky in that time.\n111. Data Needs\n\nOn meteorological data (Question 4 ) , one additional need\nis for an inventory of atmospheric data for aircraft design.\n130 or so data accumulation programs have been run. It was\nbeyond the ability of this recorder to keep track of the\ndata sources mentioned, and some of the references weren\'t\nall that clear anyway. Ramsdell had just surveyed micrometeorological data, and FAA is correcting low-level data as\n\n281\nJ\n\nwell as generating new data. Someone should correlate\nexisting thunderstorm data. The Aircraft Design Committee\nstrongly endorsed undertaking a survey of what is available,\nits format and limitations. A consensus was that aircraft\nare the best data probes.\nOperationally, improvement is needed in forecasting and\nreporting atmospheric conditions. Especially in the terminal\narea, the occurrence of shear and turbulence needs to be\nrelated to the existence of "bad weather," although shear\nhas been observed also in smooth air. Enroute, systematic\nreporting of atmospheric conditions is needed to improve\nforecasting capability. A start is to be made by collecting\nwind, temperature, etc., data continuously via satellite\nfrom a few commercial airliners. Most airlines are reluctant\nto volunteer to carry around the extra 75 poinds needed to\ndo that, but this will be a vast improvement over radiosonde\ndata.\nIV. Lightning\nNone of the Aircraft Design Committee members was knowledgeable on lightning protection, Question 7. We listened\nwith interest, at some length, to Plumer at one session and\nto Durrett at a later one.\nFrom Plumer we learned something of the mechanism of\nlightning on aircraft. It is the return stroke from the\nground that is the big jolt. Discharge takes about half a\nsecond, skipping down the length of the aircraft from nose\nto tail and holding onto the trailing edge. The charge is\nmost intense initially, dropping off as the strike progresses\naft. Damage may occur either directly or from currents\ninduced in aircraft systems. There is a theory that lightning strikes ringing back and forth from nose to tail at the\nspeed of light induce extremely high voltage. A nose pitot\n\n282\n\nboom makes a good lightning rod. So does the 7 4 7 \xe2\x80\x99 s wing\ntip probe. Lightning follows the pitot heater power cord.\nStatic discharges will quiet noise but are ineffective\nagainst lightning.\nA major problem with design criteria is uncertainty\nabout the maximum voltages to be expected at altitude.\nSmall-scale zaps give scary transients when scaled up to the\n200,000 amperes measured at ground level.\nTwo design trends increase the severity of the lightning\nproblem. One is sophisticated electronics in applications\ncritical for flight safety, as in the basic flight control\nsystem. Digital operation and the low voltage level in\ncurrent electronics applications cause special concern for\nthe effects of electrical transients. The second trend is\nto composite structures. N o t only do composites lack the\nshielding and grounding properties of metal structures, they\nalso may be more susceptible to damage by lightning strikes.\nLightning has also been observed to cause engine compressor\nstall. The integrity of composites can probably be assured\nby adding another layer of laminate, changing the resin\ncomposition, or some such procedure.\nSuccessful protection is thought possible, and not too\ncostly, through good design practice. On NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orbiter this\nincludes two-wire systems, short ground lines, shielding of\nanalytically-determined strike and maximum-field-intensity\npoints, and nose diverter strips (insulation underneath is\naffected by a strike). It is important to consider lightning\nearly in the design phase. Testing is expensive, but at\nleast one sample of each component should be tested. The\nfirst one generally fails in test, requiring some redesign.\nThe expense and risk preclude lightning tests on the complete\nassembled Orbiter. There is concern about re-entry if a\nlightning strike is sustained on the way up, which might\n\n283\n1\n\ncause spalling of the heat shield, for example. For aircraft, a lightning hole in a radome can be enlarged by rain.\nThere continue to be enough fires and explosions\nrelated to aircraft fuel systems to generate uncertainty\nthat we know enough about sources of ignition by lightning.\nKerosene is better than JP-4 fuel, which is more volatile\nand flammable at altitudes for lightning strikes. There is\na thought that rather than lightning causing an accident,\npossibly the aircraft breakup and fuel spill might induce\nlightning.\nPlumer would very much like to get reports of "interesting" lightning strikes--that is, ones affecting aircraft\nstructure or equipment which have been experienced in\naircraft operation. It was noted that NASA will be flying\na Lear Jet with Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory instrumentation at Kennedy to find out if the induced current\nreally is less at altitude or not.\n\nV.\n\nOther Factors\n\nQuestions 8 and 9 concern temperature, rain, hail,\nicing, pressure, density, corrosives, abrasives, etc. While\noperational problems are recognized, it is felt that sufficient data are available for design. How to apply the data\nisn\'t always as clear. Mention of icing brought out some\nscary stories of quick, large buildups; pilot awareness is\nneeded.\n\n284\n\n'
