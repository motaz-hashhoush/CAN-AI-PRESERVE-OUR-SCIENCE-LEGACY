The Hubble mirror conic constant is inferred from these results and comparisons are made with earlier conic values reported by teams comprising the HARP (Hubble Aberration Recovery Project) study. A number of important lessons learned from the Hubble phase retrieval problem are described and a discussion is given on how these have been incorporated into the JWST Observatory design.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080039137, "endDate": "2007-03-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "a579d0fc725d41dd8dba7d62ccbd7483", "id": "ae52bfaffee748b2a8a1dc29a99320bf"}], "name": "2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "a579d0fc725d41dd8dba7d62ccbd7483", "startDate": "2007-03-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080039137, "id": "435e543cab984eec93b54c15d415ab45", "publicationDate": "2007-03-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
