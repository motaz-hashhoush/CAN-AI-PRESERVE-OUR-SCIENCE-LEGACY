Industry needs to become more proactive in the regulatory process to ensure that\nregulations are based on sound science and not just on emotion and political expediency.\nThe 70s were the decade that focused on treatment technology by scrutinizing a\ncompany\'s gaseous, liquid and solid emissions. The 80s were the decade that included\nthe manufacturing process itself by scrutinizing a company\'s products especially for\nrecycability. We are now adding the incoming feedstocks and including the scrutiny of a\ncompany\'s raw materials and energy consumption that are used in the manufacturing\nprocesses.\nThere are some who think it is not enough to eliminate the emissions of\nchemicals that have been officially classified as hazardous, we must also eliminate the use\nof those chemicals.\n\n146\n\nPollution\n\nPrevention\n\nofficials,\n\nand industry\n\nAnalysis\n\n(LCA)\n\nenvironmental\nmaintenance,\n\nhas the support\nofficials\n\nis a way of addressing\nimplications\n\nimportant\nto include\nof the environmental\nnot environmental\n\npollution\n\nfor all of the phases\n\nuse and disposal\n\ndo the things\n\nof the majority\n\nof environmentalists,\n\nand all seem to be committed\nprevention.\n\nLCA\n\nmanufacture\n\nLife Cycle\n\naddresses\n\nin the life of a product,\n\nas well as during\n\ngovernment\n\nto the concept.\nduring\n\nof the product.\n\nIt is\n\nfull cost accounting\nin LCA.
