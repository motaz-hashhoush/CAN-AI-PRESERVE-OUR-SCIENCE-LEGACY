Once the working material is In an excited\nstate, it will emit light as a result of the passage of a stimulating beam of\nlight. The emitted light will be found to have the identical frequency, phase,\nand direction as the stimulating light. One of the requirements for this to\nhappen is that the stimulating light have a frequency which is in one of the\nseveral rather narrow bands in which the excited material can emit radiation.\nAs is true of any amplifier, the laser can become an oscillator if it\nis coupled to a resonant device and if there is feedback of some of the output\nenergy. The usual laser device consists of a suitable material (solid or gas)\nplaced between two parallel mirror surfaces. The space between the mirrors\nforms a resonant cavity (resonant at each frequency at which they are separated\nby an integral number of half wave lengths) and feedback is inherent in the\nplacement of the losing material in the cavity. This device will, if the losing\nmaterial can be kept in ah excited state, oscillate continuously at a frequency\nwhich is within the emission band of the material and at which there are an\nintegral number of wavelengths of light in the round trip between the mirrors*\nThe frequency can be discontinuously changed in these integral jumps over\na narrow band by changing the separation of the mirrors.\nThe ring laser differs from the conventional laser in having three ormore mirrors so placed as to cause the light to travel around a closed path\n(triangular, square or other); the losing material (presently a He-Ne mixture\nfor CW operation) is placed in one or more of the legs between mirrors as\nin Figure 1-1. In principle the ring laser is not different from the parallel\nmirror form and the possible oscillation frequencies are determined by having\nan Integral number of wavelengths around the entire path. Because of the\n\nfi\ni.i\n\nclosed nature of the path, however, there can be two distinct light beams\ninvolved, one traveling clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Put\nanother way, there can be two simultaneous oscillations for the two opposed\ndirections of light travel.\nFor rotation tensing, the pertinent characteristic of the ring laser\nis that the effective distance around the closed path changes when rotation\nof the assembly occurs, the length increases for light traveling in the same\nsense as the rotation while the length decreases for light traveling in the\nopposite sense. Because of this the resonant frequencies for the cavity change,\ngoing up for one direction of light travel and down for the opposite. We\nthus find that under the influence of rotation the device will have two simultaneous oscillations at different frequencies with the difference being almost\nexactly proportional to the input angular rate. It should be noted that aside\nfrom the effects of rotation, the two paths are identical so that small path\nvariations cancel. To make use of this interesting property, it is necessary\nto mix samples of the clockwise and counterclockwise beams and apply to a\nphotocell detector. The total light intensity as seen by the cell will vary at\nthe difference frequency and its electrical output will have this same frequency.\nCertain of the points which make this an attractive approach to rotation\nsensing can be stated as follows:\n1.\n\nThe device should, theoretically, be unaffected by acceleration.\n\n2. The device has no moving parts.\n3. Its output is inherently digital (frequency is proportional to :\n. rate; hence, each count is a small angular increment).\n\xe2\x80\xa2.-\'.-.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4. The scale factor is a function of a relatively long path which,\ncan be very stable in percentage terms.\n\n5.\n\nBecause the speed of light is so great, the effective path\nlength changes are very small for practical rates; for this\nreason, saturation rate is very high and second order\neffects are small.\n\nThere also are some problems:\n1. . There are many different cavity oscillation modes possible within the\nexciting line width,and operating conditions must be carefully\nselected and controlled to secure and maintain the particular\nmode desired.\n2.\n\nThere is always some coupling between the CW and CCW beams\n(backscattering from various optical surfaces, for instance),\nwhich tends to lock the frequencies together. This effect\nclosely resembles the locking of oscillators in superheterodyning.\nThe result is that the frequencies become distinct only above\nsome effective path length difference or threshold; furthermore,\nin the region just above this threshold, the frequency difference\nis a non-linear function of the path length difference as seen\nin Figure 1-2.\n\n3.\n\nThere is no sense of rotation direction in the detected signal.\n\nExperience has shown that practical devices can be expected to have a\nthreshold too high to be useful (20 to 100 degrees per hour) due to the frequency\nlocking. The introduction of an offset bias, however, reduces this considerably\nand additionally has the added virtue of giving rotation sense. A bias can\ntake any form which causes an unbalance in the effective path lengths in the\nCW and CCW directions; it causes the oscillation frequencies to differ when\nno input rate is present and pushes the troublesome locking frequency away\nfrom zero rate. The bias must, of course, be great enough to place the\nlocking frequency completely out of the range of rates which is of interest.\nIt must be stable enough not to degrade the accuracy of measurement of the\n\n~1\nfrequency difference.\n\nBias also permits easy discrimination between CW and\n\nCCW inputs although it is not the only possibility for this.\nThere are a number of possible forms of bias (including an actual\nmechanical input), but most promising results have been obtained using a\nFaraday cell. This cell depends on the fact that the velocity of light in a\ndense medium is different for light Traveling with a magnetic field than for\nlight traveling counter to the magnetic field as in Figure 1-3.\n\nSuch a cell\n\ncan thus be used to create the desired path length unbalance.\nUse of a Faraday cell for bias has been found to eliminate the locking\nproblem but it uncovers two new problems. The new problems are bias stability\n(related to magnetic field strength stability and characteristics of the material\nused in the cell) and oscillation mode stability. Bias stability is a relatively\nstraightf6rward! engineering problem and is being attacked as such. Oscillation mode stability is a somewhat different kind of problem and requires\nfurther discussion.\n\\\n\nAs has been stated, the ring laser can oscillate at any frequency which\nis within the narrow bands determined by the width of the exciting line, by\ni characteristics of the losing material,and in providing an integral number of\nwavelengths around the closed path. Since there may well be 10 to 10\nwavelengths around the path, it is possible to have oscillation at any of\nseveral frequencies as in Figure 1-4.\n\nAs first order effects, these oscil-\n\nlations are the same for C V and CCW beams and in general cancel; however,\nthis is not true for second order effects. Any random switching of frequencies\ncan be a source of randomness in the output frequency.\n\nBecause, however,\n\nbias is assumed constant/ it Will be removed as a constant and the net\nresult Is a random drift.\n\nO\n\n9\n\nExperience has shown that when using a Faraday bias cell in a moderately well-controlled temperature environment, but with no temperature\ncompensation, the major randomness to be expected is due to the abovediscussed mode changes. Results have been of the order of 5- to 10-degree\nper hour variations. (These would probably average out to a substantial\ndegree over a long time period, but results of better than one degree per\nhour would be doubtful.) .\nThe most recent work has been in the direction of frequency locking\nreduction of the ring by small motions of one of the rings (done piezoelectrically).\nThere are several possible techniques for a reference against which to\ndo this. The particular approach used by Wing, Macek, and co-workers at\nSperry has reduced the randomness in the output to an equivalent rate in the\norder of one degree per hour. Present indications are that the major source\nof randomness is now stability (thermal) in the Faraday cell. Studies are\nbeing actively pursued in mode enhancement of a single frequency and mode\nrejection of other frequencies in the cavity that are capable of being excited\nby the line width;\nIn terms of size, the ring laser is still relatively large. The recent\nresults have been achieved in a triangular device in a solid homogenous\nblock, sharply reducing scattering and permitting single mod ing in the cavity.\nThe status of the ring laser can be summarized as follows:\n1\n\nPresent results are approaching conventional gyro performance\nbut are not yet there.\nQuantum jumps in performance improvement are still being made.\nPresent size Is not competitive, but the enclosed area has been\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\no\n\nreduced by a factor of roughly eight in the past year while\nperformance has been improved by a factor of around thirty;\nthus, it is difficult to predict the future.\nBecause the output is inherently digital/ and because very\nhigh input rotes can be accommodated/ the device appears Well\nsuited for future use in strapdown applications.\nSimultaneous attacks on frequency locking and biasing\nconcepts are yielding substantial improvement.\n\n" \' " ""\n\nj\'-.ilo-\'\n:\' -oc;<:.-ed\n\xe2\x80\xa2;?-?, p.\n\n;\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2;.,\n\n"A s:;x;0:y of\'\n\nic!\xc2\xa3 01 tie\n:J1\n\n"\n\nooh.3 viv plu^j-cKu-rui a.-.; o .--;<\xe2\x80\xa2 . ila^ivr-; , "\n\nTAB ;:nc Wave,\n\n(uv.^e 1940} .\n\n......\n\nand EJ.oc trorio, Vc .\'. i~ ,\n\n;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\'\n\n.-:i-ono\'..rit2 , I 1 \'.,.

It employs a spherical metal rotor\nshielded from stray magnetic fields and supported or levitated without physical contact in ultra-high vacuum by servo-controlled high-voltage electric\nfield*. The rotor, initially accelerated by induction motor techniques, tpint\nfreely with virtually no friction during gyro operation.\n\nFundamental advan-\n\ntages result from the simple geometry, the absence of internal heat dissipation\nand the elimination of high stress concentrations and wear associated with\nconventional gyro bearings.\nAlthough the present work has been primarily for nautical applications,\nthe gyro promises high efficiency for spacecraft and satellite applications\nwhere low acceleration environments permit the use of low voltage, low\npower consumption rotor support circuitry.\nThe electric vacuum gyro was invented in 1952 by Dr. Arnold Nordsieck\n\n(2-1)\n\nwhile studying the problems of inertial guidance of atomic submarines for accurate\nlaunching of Polaris missiles. Realizing that spin-axis bearings were a major\nsource of gyro error, he undertook the study of field-supported rotors.\n\nAlthough\n\nmagnetic fields easily provide the necessary large forces, troublesome torques\nresult from eddy current losses, hysteresis losses, and rotor magnetic moment. \xe2\x80\xa2<.\nTheoretical consideration of high-voltage breakdown in vacuum indicated that\nlarge forces could also be applied electrostatically without electrical breakdown.\n\nFurthermore, lightweight hollow rotors could be supported using the\n\nexisting state of the art. Since electrostatic forces always act perpendicular\nto an equipotential surface, torque due to these forces can be minimized by\nusing an accurate spherical metallic rotor for which all forces act through a\ncommon center which, by balancing, Is made coincident with the mass center.\n\no\n\n*\n\nSpurious torques, due fo electric fields interacting with an inaccurate\nspherical rotor, constitute the only important limitation to gyro performance.\nStray magnetic fields cause both precession and rotor slowdown\ntorques. The earth\'s magnetic field, if not eliminated by shielding, typically\nresults in a slowdown time constant of seven days. To achieve a drift rate\nof .0001 deg/hour requires a shielding ratio of about 60 and results by itself\nin a coasting rundown time constant of 24,000 days. This degree of shielding\nis readily .achieved.\nResidual gas causes principally a slowdown torque. The maximum\npermissible pressure (10\n\ntorr) for high voltage breakdown with properly\n\nconditioned electrodes results in a rundown time constant of 15 days. A\n\n-8\n\npressure of 10\n\n-9\n\nor 10\n\ntorr, which is needed to properly condition the\n\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'\'\n\nelectrodes,accounts for a rundown time constant of 15,000 to 150,000 days* \xe2\x80\xa2\n-9\nPressures of 10 torr have been achieved in the gyro, without benefit of\nbakeout, using a titanium ion pump developed at the laboratory.\nTorques can result from a potential gradient along the rotor surface.\nFor this reason, insulating materials, such as an anodized layer which can\ntrap stray charge, must be avoided.\n\nDisplacement charge flowing over a\n\nresistive rotor surface can also produce a gradient resulting in torque.\nHowever, this effect is completely negligible for a clean metallic rotor\nsurface.\nEarly experimental work employing a hollow spherical rotor which\nhad a "saturn ring" flange for capacitive angle data pickoff was conducted\n(2-2)\nby the Instrument Development and Manufacturing Corporation,\n(2-3)\n(2-4)\nGeneral Electric Company,\n. and Minneapolis-Honeywell Company\nunder Navy contracts. The first tests in 1957 showed large spurious torque\n\n.s.\n\nbecause of unexpectedly large unbalanced forces acting on the "saturn ring" \'\ncaused by stray electric fields resulting from unpredictable charge (up to\nseveral hundred volts) accumulated on the isolated rotor. At.that time, the\nUniversity of Illinois, Coordinated Science Laboratory, began experimental\nwork using completely spherical rotors, optical data readout techniques,\nand a simple resonant circuit, passive element rotor support or levitation\n(2-5)\n\'\nserve circuit.\nGeneral Electric and Minneapolis-Honeywell followed\n.with completely spherical rotor gyro designs under both Navy and Air Force\n(2-6)\ncontracts.\nSignificant improvements in the areas of high vacuum and\n\nt\n\nhigh voltage vacuum breakdown made at the Coordinated Science Laboratory\nled to demonstrations of completely reliable electric vacuum gyro operation\n.of both Minneapolis-Honeywell and the University of Illinois in 1959. The\nencouraging gyro test results stimulated a current Navy requirement for\ninclusion of electric vacuum gyros as monitors in the existing Ship\'s Inertral\n(2-7)\nNavigation System (SINS).\nActive electric vacuum gyro development\nis currently being supported at General Electric, Honeywell, Inc./ and the\nUniversity of Illinois.\nGimballed vs. Gimballess Electric Vacuum Gyro\nThe torque resulting from the action of electric fields on an imperfectly\nshaped spherical gyro rotor has led to the development of two basic forms of\nthe electric vacuum gyro.\nIn the gimballess form, the gyro case is fixed with respect to the\nvehicle or stable platform and the rotor axis is allowed to assume any direction\nwith respect to the case and levitation electrodes. Optical data readout is\nobtained by fixed photoelectric microscopes viewing coded patterns which\ncover a large proportion of the rotor surface and give a measurement of the\n\nO\n\nrotor spin-axis angle, relative to the case. This form of gyro is subject to\nchanging torques as changing regions of the Imperfectly shaped spherical\nrotor come under and are acted upon by various electrodes. A compensating\ncomputer of considerable complexity is necessary to correct for these\ntorques when highly accurate performance Is required.\nIn the gimballed form of the gyro, the case is mounted in gimbals\nand servo driven so that the electrodes are always symmetrically located with\nrespect to the rotor spin axis. Since the relative position of rotor and electrodes\ndoes not change, torque due to imperfect rotor sphericity interacting wfth\nany electrode can be maintained at a null value which is initially achieved\nby individual fine adjustments of the electrode geometries. The gimbal\n\n\'\n\ntechnique also enables the use of a null-balance type of optical data readout\nwhich generally affords greater accuracy. Added complexity is the only\napparent disadvantage of the gimballed gyro.\nThe Gyro Assembly\n\n:\n\n\'\n\nThe University of Illinois gyro is a gimballed type employing six orthogonally spaced electrodes for levitation, illustrated schematically in\nFigure 2-1.\nThe rotor is accurately centered within the electrodes by servo-Controlled\nhigh voltage. An acceleration of 4 G on a 25 gram rotor is supported by\n3800 volts RMS with an electrode gap of 0.025 cm. This gives a field intensity\nof 150,000 volts per centimeter and a field emission current of 0.5 micro\namperes. For a given field intensity, smaller field emission currents result\nfor narrower gaps. Field intensities of 1,000,000 volts/centimeter have\nbeen achieved without high voltage breakdown, Two pairs of photoelectric\n\nmicroscopes reading a zig-zag pattern around the rotor provide error signals\nfor the gimbal servos which maintain the housing (electrodes and microscopes)\nin constant alignment with the rotor spin axis. The four induction coils in\nFigure 2-1 form a poly-phase motor for initial acceleration of the gyro rotor.\nPresent rotors have sphericities of 75-250 nanometer\n\nand are\n\nbalanced to produce a pendulosity period of about three minutes of time.\nAn air bearing support is used for preliminary balancing. Final measurements require the use of an evacuated electrostatic bearing, typically an\nactual gyro assembly.\nResearch in high voltage vacuum breakdown has indicated the necessity\nfor clean vacuum systems free of organic vapors. Since precision parts pro"\nhibit bakeout of the gyro, vapor pumps are not used. A flask filled with\nactivated charcoal and immersed in liquid nitrogen is used to reduce the\n-2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nsystem pressure from atmospheric to 10 torr in about one hour. The flask\nis then valved or sealed off and a Varian Vacion or similar titanium sput-7\n-8\ntering pump is employed to reduce the pressure to 10 or 10 torr. This\npressure is usually maintained for several days before sealing off the gyro.\nAfter sealoff, the gyro pressure may rise as high as 10 torr. This drops\n-8\nquickly to 10 torr upon activation of the permanently attached combination titanium ion pump and Bayard-Alpert vacuum gauge.\n_9\n10 torr have been reached in the^gyro.\n\nPressures of\n\nThe coils are excited by two phase power at a frequency of 2 or 3 kHz.\n\'.j\nA typical operating speed of 200 revolutions per second is reached in about\n15 minutes. Howeyerj it takes about a day to dissipate the heat generated\nin the rotor during runup and achieve stable gyro operation. Figure 2-2\nshows also the two He I mho I tz coils which are excited by D.C, to damp the\n\nwobble which results when the rotor is initially accelerated about other than\n{ft intended ipln axU and to torque the gyro into initial alignment. A uniform\nmagnetic field creates a torque which tends to bring the rotor spin axis into\nalignment with the magnetic flux lines and thus the axis of the coils.\n\nAngular\n\nmomentum U loit during torqutng and mutt be mad* up by additional operation\nof the spin motor coils. During gyro operation all coils are de-energized.\nElectric Torques\nSimple gyro calculations, for a drift of .0001 degrees per hour using a\n5.08 cm diameter hollow sphere rotating at 500 revolutions per second, show\n-9\nthat the line of action of 1 G supporting force must pass within 6.6 x 10 cm\nof the mass center.\n\nSince electric fields act perpendicular to an equipotential surface/\n\na good gyro would inherently result from the use of a rotor so accurate that\n-9\n- \'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nthe centers of curvature for all regions of the surface fall within 6.6 x 10 cm,\nof each other. Since this accuracy is three orders of magnitude beyond\nrealizability, special techniques are employed in the gimballed gyro for\n\n.\n\nnulling the torques due to imperfect rotor sphericity. Centrifugal deformation\n-4\ncauses additional elliptical distortion (2.5x 10 cm),which is large compared\nto machining errors.\n\n-4\nFor a typical gyro design having 2.5 x 10 cm rotor distortion and\ndrift rate of .0001 degrees per hour, the translational tolerance must be\n2.5 x 10\n\ncm, which corresponds to a levitation servo capacitance bridge\n\nbalance of one part in 100,000. This is a difficult requirement which will\nprobably be relaxed by making use of more spherical rotors specially machined\nto compensate for centrifugal deformation.\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\no\n\nStotus\nThe glmbolled electrically supported gyroscope for Naval use Is being\nsuccessfully operated in the Fleet. Such gyros manufactured by Honeywell\nhave been undergoing tests aboard the USS Compass Island for several years\nwith very gratifying results. Performance specifications have been exceeded.\nSome results have been limited by the accuracy of the reference navigation\nsystems. ESG data led to the discovery of otherwise undetected errors in the\n\n/\n\nSINS timing system; i.e.,\n\na scalar counting down from the basic 60 cps master\n(2-8)\ntime reference would occasionally gain a count because of extraneous noise/\nThe above gyroscope uses a 7.5 cm diameter spherical beryllium rotor\n\npreshaped to allow for centrifugal deformation. End axis optical readout\n\n>\n.:\n\n("D" pattern) for gimbal followup is employed. The rotor speed decays during :\noperation with a several hundred day l/e time constant. Rotor speed, since \'-it determines sphericity, is used in computer compensation of the gyro. This\ngyro is designed for only 2 G and has a relatively high ratio of rotor-mass\nto electrode-area.\nAlthough the specification life is exceeded, ultimate burnout of the\nfilament in the combination vacuum gauge and titanium getter ion pump\nresults in vacuum failure typically after 5,000 hours.\nSince the existing conventional SJNS systems are providing the required\nperformance, ESG\'s are not currently being installed in new submarines.\nA miniaturized version of the gimbal led ESG developed for the Air Force\nby Honeywell has been laboratory-tested.\n(2-9)\nNASA is interested in a non-gimballed gyro capable of 100 G,\nHigh voltage breakdown research indicates that with present materials,\n-whisker growth (and ultimate breakdown) takes place at electric fields*\n\n:\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\ngreater than 0.5\xe2\x80\x94\n\'\n\n9\n\n. This provides a levitation force of 11,000\nGlU\n\nnewtons/sq. meter of area and would accommodate 100 G using an as yet\nundeveloped 5 cm diameter rotor which weighs less than 11 grams.\nThe problems of low drift in a non-gimballed gyro subject to acceleration forcei are many.\n\nHowever, short periods of acceleration followed by\n\nlonger drift-free periods of zero g space flight are feasible; and NASA is\nsupporting the development of all-attitude, non-gimballed gyros with\ntwo-scale (high g and very low g) levitation systems.\n\nGeneral Motors.i\'i\n\nResearch Laboratories under the direction of Arnold Nordsieck has developed\nand tested a novel all-attitude readout scheme using a repetitive pattern\nwhich covers a large portion of the rotor surface. They also have developed\na technique for accurately figuring the spherical surface while the rotor is\nlevitated and spinning at operating speed in vacuum.\nThere naturally is interest in a combined ESG and electrostatic accelerometer <\nHoneywell proposes nuclear magnetic resonance as a technique for accurately\nconverting rectified AC levitation current of an existing gyro into frequency\nfor use by the guidance computer.\n\nBell Aerosystems has developed\n\nan electrostatic accelerometer using variable frequency quantized voltage\npulses for the input axis levitation.\n\n.;\'\xe2\x80\xa2;..\n\n-\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.:\n\n:\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nREFERENCES\n\n-\n\n"\n\n- ^\n\n2-1.\n\nNordsieck, A., "Feasibility of a Free Gyro Navigation System,"\n\nContract No. DA 36-039-SC-56695 (1954), U. of Illinois, Control Systems\nLaboratory, Urbana, Illinois.\n\nj\n\ni\n\n**\n\n2-2.\n\nInstrument Development and Manufacturing Corporation,\n\nContract No. Nonr 1579(00), Status Reports, September 1956 to June 1957.\n.. 2.3 General Electric Company, Contract NObs 72163, Interim\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nDevelopment Report for Free Gyro (Electrostatic), October 1956;-Second\n:\n\nIntenm Development Report for Electrostatic Gyro, January 1957;\n. \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\n--\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\x94, (Report MP-77), Future Prog ram ~\n\nElectrostatic Gyro Development, \'October 1957.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n.\n\nrT"\n\nI\n\n. . 2 . 4 Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company, Contract NObs 72164,\nEiectrostatic\'Gyro, MH Aero Reports 48221-PR 1-6, (October 1956-January 1958);\n\n-.\'\'\xe2\x80\xa2\';.\'\xe2\x80\xa2 MH Aero Reports 1502-PR 7-9/)(May J958-December 1958); MH Aero Report\n>\n\n1502-TR 1, (March 1959).\n\n\',\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n:\n\n\'-.\n\n2.5\n\n1\n\n::-. \' ? - \' \xe2\x80\xa2 " \'\n\n\'"\'\n\n\' . . \' - \\-, \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUniversity of Illinois, Control Systems Laboratory, Contract No.\n\n:\n\nDA 3dr039-SC-56695, Progress.Reports, June, July, August, 1957; March,\n\n:.\n\nApril, May, 1959. \'. f: _.\'.--._ :} V;\' ; \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94:\xe2\x80\x94.\n\n;\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2: \'\n\n. \' .;;. r;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2-<-\n\n; Coordinated Science Laboratory, Contract\n\n\' \xe2\x80\xa2 - \' . \' No. DA 36-039-SC-85122, Progress Reports June, July, August, 1959;\n.\n" \'.\n\xe2\x80\xa2/\n"\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 . . - " \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \' . . \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\xe2\x80\xa2 \'.

It is seen to consist of a rotating member\ncontaining a spherical cavity which is completely filled with a liquid.\n\n\'\n\nBecause of the rotation of the cavity the liquid body is also in rotation (at\nthe Mime speed) ond potiettei angular momentum; for thli reason/ the\nliquid body attempts to maintain a constant spin axis direction in space.\nThe liquid body, being spherical, is free to spin about an axis other than\nthe cavity spin axis; for small space rotations of the direction of the cavity\nspin axis the fluid body spin axis will, therefore, continue to point its\noriginal direction in space.\nThe above describes a free gyroscope and, in the absence of viscous\nshear torques/ the operation would be completely as described.\n\nBecause there\n\nare viscous shear torques produced whenever there is a rotation of the cavity\nspin axis away from the direction of the liquid body spin axis/ the liquid body\nspin axis is processed back into alignment with the cavity spin axis. This\nis essentially an exponential response and the time constant Is given/ with\nreasonable accuracy in a boundary layer derivation by i\n\n2\nV\n\nwhere\n\nA\n\nR. \' 2\n.-re exec \'\xe2\x80\xa2"\'rasUit is.\' T\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\xa2 -ft \\J *&\xe2\x80\x94r\n0.72 V iZ V\n\nR\n\nIs the cavity radius in cm.\n\nft\n\nis spin rate in radians per second.\n\nV\n\nis kinematic viscosity in stokes.\n\nT\n\nis time in seconds.\n\nReproduced from\nbest available r\xc2\xbb\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\n... The fluid sphere is thus seen to be a rate gyroscope, having the above\ntime constant in its response. It may also be considered a displacement\ngyroscope in which the displacement angle decays.\n\n:,.\n\nThe relative shear between the cavity walls and the liquid body can be\nshown to take place in a relatively thin boundary layer that permits consideration of the liquid body moving as a unit.\n\n.-.\'.\n\nThus the liquid rotor acts much like a solid ball having a diameter\n\n;\n\nslightly smaller than that of the cavity. This bail is separated from the cavity\n\nT\n\nwalls by a thin lubricating layer of the liquid.

The motor can be large, is\neasily cooled, and does not dissipate heat in the sensitive element.\nThe differential pressure transduced by the microphone goes to\nzero when the displacement angle goes to zero. Because the\npressure of interest is alternating it is easily sensed and a static shift\nof diaphragm position produces no output signal. For this reason\n\n,\n\n,\n\nO\n\nthere is no hysteresis error or time dependent bias error. It should\nalso be noted that the null of the alternating pressure coincides with\nthe zero displacement between the spin axes even if the sensing\nports are at unequal angles with respect to the cavity spin axis.\nBecause the spin bearings are external to the sensitive element,\nposition shifts in th^ese bearings are not important.\n\nFurthermore,\n\n.-\n\n. they can be large and well lubricated; this leads to long life and\npermits bearing selection to withstand high accelerations.\nBecause the density of the liquid is of secondary importance,\naccurate temperature control is not required.\n\nVariations in temperature\n\ndo affect the viscosity of the liquid and, hence, the scale value; even,\nthis is relatively small, however, because the viscosity appears under\n;\n\nthe radical and because a low temperature viscosity index liquid can\nbe used (about 1 percent per degree F).\nPressure transducers can be used in pairs, as shown in Figure 3-2.\nUsed in this way external vibration effects tend to cancel. In addition,\nthe diaphragms can be made to have reasonably the same density\nas the liquid, thereby almost totally eliminating sensitivity to external\nvibration.\nThe optimum spin speed is low, leading to good life and rapid\nreaction.\nOnly simple moderate tolerance parts are required and no special\nassembly or adjustments are needed, so the construction costs are very\n\no\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\'.\'. \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.

Each of the approaches\nmakes use of the common sensing element which has no moving parts and thus\neliminates problems directly associated with the manufacture, suspension,\nand powering of the rotating mechanical mass in a conventional gyroscope \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe objectives of the various approaches include development of low cost\ngyros of modest accuracy, of gyros capable of function in very high g environment, of gyros witK.high reliability and very long life, and of gyros with\n\n:.\n\nextremely high sensitivity.\nAll of the approaches which have been suggested can be described\n\n>/\n\nstarting from the equation of motion for a net nuclear magnetization M\n- * \xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 . \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \' . \' \'\nin a magnetic field H\n.\n\ndM/dt= - y H x M\nwhere v is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\n(4-1)\nThe net magnetization\n\nM\n\nmay\n\nresult from the thermal equilibrium distribution of the nuclear magnetic dipole\nmoments or from some non-equilibrium distribution that results from a process\nsuch as optical orientation. In Equation (4-1) all relaxation terms have\nbeen ignored. In practical instrumentation of an NMR gyro/ these relaxation\neffects play an important role in determining the limits of operation and\n\nsensitivity.

The nuclear magnetization is then caused to precess. The\nnuclear signal is received in pickup coils tuned to 2>fL\n\nand\n\noriented to detect transverse oscillation of the magnetization.\n\nThe nuclear\n\nsample is a proton water s mple doped with paramagnetic ions. It has also\nbeen pointed out that the RF drive frequency may be a subharmonic of Y Hft\n(4-3)\nand the fundamental frequency YHpicked up.\nSeveral models\n:\nhave been constructed to test various aspects of the theory. Rotation rates\nof the order of 100 RPM have been detected. A more advanced model of\nthe induction . gyro has been designed and is currently under construction.\nThis model will be shielded against the earth\'s magnetic fields. The output\nnoise level will be equivalent to an angular velocity of the order of several\n\n(4-2)\n\n,30-\n\nearth-rate units. The object of this program is a unit with moderately low\ndrift rates and modest cost. In addition to this approach,newer concepts\nare being explored which employ maser operation. In this instrumentation,\ntwo nuclei are also used to eliminate problems associated with magnetic\nfield fluctuations^4"4*\nThe optically pumped NMR gyro in Figure 4-2 is a device which obtains\nrotation information from simultaneous observation of steady state NMR signals\n199\n201\nfrom Hg\nand Hg\n. The rotation is detected as a phase shift between\nthe two signals which are the outputs of an NMR controlled oscillator. This \xe2\x80\xa2\ninstrument is a single degree of freedom, rate integrating gyroscope, which .\nis well suited for strapdown application due to its inherent insensitivity to\nrotation about any axis except the sensitive axis defined by the magnetic\n(4-5)\nfield.\nThe use of two nuclear species in the same magnetic field\neliminates the need for exact control or knowledge of the magnetic field.\n-\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2\nReferring to the basic NMR gyro equation (4-2), the H field has two\ncomponents: Hn a dc field of moderate homogeneity, and H., an oscillatory\nfield at the frequency Y^U, directed orthogonal to Hfl.\n\nThe rotation U)\n\nwhich is sensed is that component parallel to H_. Several models have been\nconstructed and tested. A rather complete theory has been developed.\nExperimental operation and theory are in agreement.\nTypical test operation of the experimental gyro model of the gyro\no\n\nin laboratory has shown an uncertainty in the drift rate of 0.03 /hr.\n\nThese\n\nwere the results of static runs in which the uncertainty is taken as the rms\n1\n(A. f>\\\ndeviation of the slope as calculated by least mean square methods*\n\n:\n\n33\n\n,\n\nRecent developmenh in methods for producing regions with dimishingly\nsmall magnetic fields have now made appear possible a nuclear gyroscope in\nwhich the net nuclear magnetization is simply isolated from its surroundings.\nReferring again to the fundamental equation (4-2), when the magnetic\n\n:\n\nfield H is made equal, to zero, any apparent motion or change in direction\n.\n\nof the net nuclear moment would be determined only by the rotation of the\nobservation apparatus in inertial space.\nAn experiment has been proposed to test the Lense Thirring effect\nthrough observation on an He gyro in a satellite.\nV referenced in Section 6.\n\n;y\n\nThis is further\n\nThe general theory of relativity predicts a small\n\nperturbation on the motion of satellites about an astronomical body which is\n\n"\xe2\x80\xa2:.:. rotating.\n\nA gyro carried in polar orbit would yield the greatest effect.\n3\nThe long NMR relaxation times observed in liquid He would give a gyro\n\n- with sufficiently long life and sensitivity to test the existence of this effect.\nEach of the proposed approaches to the instrumentation of an NMR\nr gyroscope has required development of experimental techniques for solution\n;;\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nof problems posed essentially by the approach taken. One problem common\n\n;<\n\nto all approaches to construction of an NMR gyro is that of magnetic field \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n/\n:\n\n:\n\n-stability.\n\nIn fact rotation and magnetic field have the same apparent effect\n\non the dynamics of the nuclear magnetization; this necessitates the control\nor knowledge of the magnetic field to the equivalent of the desired error\nin measurement of rate of rotation in most approaches. In the induction gyro,\nthis is done by means of shielding against stray fields and control of current .\nin the coils which generate the field. In the optically pumped NMR gyro/\n*~ the question of field control is answered through the Use of two kinds of\n\nnuclei in the sample. In this case, the magnetic field is treated as an unknown\nequivalent to the rotation and eliminated through the appropriate instrumentation\n3\nfor this solution of the equations. In the He -gyro, the problem of the magnetic\nfield control is to be solved by reducing the magnitude of the field to such a \'",\nsmall value that any fluctuations in its value will not influence the accuracy\nof the measurements.\n\nConclusion\n\n\\_\n\n.\n\n\',\n\n, - :.\n\nThe feasibility of constructing instruments of useful sensitivity has been\n\n;,\n\ndemonstrated by using experimental laboratory techniques.

Superconducting\nbearings are used to suspend the gyro rotor on a thin film of magnetic\nflux which permits high speed rotation in vacuum using a bearing which\nis free of wear and friction. The rotor is accelerated to operating speed\nwith a superconducting motor which is practically lossless. Rotor alignment\nIs maintained during spin-up by superconducting coils of a torquer assembly \xe2\x80\xa2\nDuring gyro operation these coils are used to apply error compensating\ntorques. Such devices offer great hope of using effectively the Intrinsic\ncharacteristics of outer space, 5 ,e ,, zero "g" and low temperature.\nThe diamagnetic property of a superconductor is used to obtain bearing\naction and to produce rotational torques to the rotor. Magnetic flux lines\ndo not penetrate the superconductor and are compelled to flow parallel\nto Its surface, resulting In a force perpendicular to this surface which is\nproportional to the second power of the flux density. Somewhat unexpectedly, small hysteresis losses occurred in superconductors when a varying\nfield was impressed on the surface even though the critical magnetic\n*\n\n:i:\n. \xe2\x80\xa2 . \' :\'-\'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2"\n\nfield was not exceeded. Such surface losses were found to be produced\n\nv^\n\nin the rotating rotor during every revolution due to changes In flux density\nresulting from acceleration forces. Since the rotor operates In a high /\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2^\xe2\x80\xa2.^\nVacuum these losses must be minimized to avoid overheating*\n\na\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\nIn earlier work, Harding^\n\n\' reported the rather compelling evidence\n\nX-\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'_\xe2\x80\xa2..\n\nr\n\nof their existence when niobium spheres absorbed enough energy whilst\nrotating in the magnetic field to cause the thermally isolated rotors to\n\n.:\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n;\n\n, : \xe2\x80\xa2;\n\nexceed this superconductive critical temperature in a matter of minutes\n\nv\n\nand thus lose support.

Superconductors such as niobium-zirconium and niobium-tin,\nwhich remain superconducting at extremely high fields, have the property of\n\n;\n\npermitting flux penetration at low density values and are therefore not useful for the gyro bearing.\n(\n(5-2)\n.\n.\nHarding\nhas published an analytical solution to the problem of support\nfield configuration leading to simple but useful coil systems shown in Figure 5-2;\nThese coils carrying opposing currents create a constant gradient field.\nBa gradient r\n\n2\n\n2\n(3 cos cp- 1)\n\nin spherical coordinates which gives stability in all dimensions. By adjusting\nthe strength of the gradient it has been found possible to eliminate magnetic\ntorque in a rapidly spinning ellipsoidally deformed rotor with respect to\ndegree of eccentricity or orientation of its axes relative to the coils.\n\n.\n\ns\n(5-1)\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe application of th\xc2\xbb luperconducting bearing to support the spherical\n\n;\n\ngyro rotor in an early General Electric model gyro is shown in Figure 5-3.\nTwo bearing coils cause a magnetic flux to flow into the clearance gap around\nthe rotor formed by the superconducting surfaces of the bearing assembly.\nThis flux is required to flow through a fixed gap near the equator which is\nprovided to improve bearing stiffness. Both vertical and lateral support is\nprovided by these bearing coils which are wound around the outside of an\nevacuated cylindrical housing in which the gyro is mounted.\n:-;\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA superconductive motor used to spin the gyro rotor to a speed of 12,000 rpm\nis located within a thin non-magnetic enclosure which permits the rotor to\n\n:\n\noperate in vacuum while the stator windings are immersed in liquid helium.\n\n;\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSince a rotating magnetic field will not spin a smooth superconducting cylinder,\n. a series of elongated slots is provided in the center of the rotor against which\nthe rotating field can react. As illustrated in Figure 5-4 stator flux which\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 enters the slots is distorted along one edge of the superconducting wall and\nresults in a force which produces a torque. A two-phase stator winding is used\n;\n\nto produce a rotating flux needed to spin the rotor. The motor is energized\nwith frequency control obtained from an optical pickoff which views a slotted\nmirror machined in the rotor surface. Rotor synchronism is thereby automatically\nmaintained until operating speed is reached and the motor de-energized. The\ntime constant of rotor speed decay has been measured to be five months and\nshould increase as rotor balance and surface properties are improved.\nTorquers are used to maintain rotor erection during acceleration to operating\nspeed and to provide error torque compensation during operation. Two torquer\n\no\nassemblies are located In the center of the rotor; one above and one below the\nmotor,each containing four small superconducting coils interconnected to produce torques about two orthogonal axes normal to the spin axis. An optical\npickoff used in an early gyro model was located outside of the cryogenic\nenvironment of the cryostat to permit use of conventional optical components\xc2\xab\nThe rotor was viewed through a port provided with several vacuum-sealed\nthermal radiation absorbing windows.\nIn General Electric\'s current unit of the gimballed cryogenic gyro,\nmajor improvements relate to the bearing configuration and to the use of an\noptical readout system in which all parts operate at liquid helium temperature.\nDesign features of this new gyro are shown in Figure 5-5.\n\nThe bearing permits\n\nseparate control of rotor stiffness along each of three orthogonal axes to give\nimproved "g" capability and better accuracy, since the rotor will be maintained\ncloser to the geometric center of the bearing than was possible in the earlier\nversion.\nThe new cryogenic optical system follows recent development of smalt \'\nhigh efficiency lighl\'-emiltting diodes which, together with suitable semiconducting sensors, have permitted design of an extremely sensitive spin axis\nposition sensing system using a reflecting flat surface formed on the rotor,\ntilted approximately one-half degree from the rotational axis.\n\nThis results\n\nin the reflected image moving in a conical path which passes through a circular\naperture to a germanium sensor. The amount of light received by the sensor\nvaries with the misalignment of the rotor spin axis and the optical axis. With\nperfect alignment a constant amount of light passes through the aperture and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nno a-c signal output results. As the rotor tilts,an a-c signal is produced which\nhas a magnitude proportional to the tilt angle. Information obtained from a\n\n-.\n\nrotor position reference slot used as part of the rotor optical system is used to\n\n.\n\nobtain phase relationship of the spin axis signal to determine direction of\nrotor tilt.\nConsiderable progress/under AF and NASA sponsorship by Harding,\nBuchhold, Schock, etc., has been made on gimballed and a bodybound\nversion of this type of gyro. A gimballed cryogenic gyro has shown a\nconstancy of drift at least as low as 0.005 degrees per hour during several\ntest runs using different rotors.\n\n.\n\n>\n\nThroughout development of superconducting gyroscopes it has been necessary\nto conduct special investigations of superconducting properties in order to define\ndesign limits and to evaluate the effects of manufacturing processes upon\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2:\n\nthese characteristics.\nFuture improvement in gyro performance is seen by the use of niobiumcoated ceramic rotors rather than the all-niobium rotors now available. The\nceramic rotor will have higher dimensional stability and be lighter in weight.\nAcceleration force capability up to approximately twenty-five "g\'s" is\npredicted with the ceramic rotor. Excellent superconducting properties have " \' \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\nalready been obtained with niobium coatings on ceramic.\nThe gimballed cryogenic gyro has been shown to offer high accuracy\npotential,and no fundamental barriers to eventual future application have\nbeen uncovered. As advances are made in cryogenic technology, the low\ntemperature environment becomes less of a challenge\xc2\xab Growing interest and\nresearch in the metallurgy of superconductors also will contribute to this program.\n\n(5) REFERENCES\n5-1 .

If the object is in free fall with\nrespect to the sensor the only measurable components of the gravitational\nfield are the gravitational force gradients which comprise a symmetric tensor*\n\nThe spatial pattern of the gravitational force gradient fields can be\nseen in a simplified form In Figure 7-3.\n(\nIf a differential force sensor or gradiometer is rotated through this\n\n,\n"\n\nspatial pattern, the output of the sensor will go through a maximum twice\n\'each revolution, while any residual unbalanced acceleration forces will cause\nexcitation of the sensor only once per revolution. This double frequency\neffect and the more general properties of tensors can be used to separate the\neffects of acceleration, rotation and gravitation by frequency filtering\ntechniques.\nIn Diesel\'s gravitational gradient detector, see Figure 7-4, an\naccelerometer mounted to a freely rotating double bob pendulum will not\nsense disturbance of the pivot axis since angular acceleration of the pendulum\nexactly cancel the component along the accelerometer sensitive axis. The\ngravity gradient signal is not similarly cancelled since the mass of the bob Is\nconcentrated as two points 90\xc2\xb0 apart in space, and thus 180\xc2\xb0 apart with\nrespect to the double frequency sinusoidal signal \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n,\n\nForward\'s gravitational mass sensor, Figure 7-5, consists of a mass\nspring system with one or more vibrational modes which is rotated at some\nsubharmonic of the vibrational mode. The presence of a non-uniform\ngravitational field excites the vibrational modes of the structure at twice\nthe rotational frequency.\n-11\n-14\nThe readout of the very small vibrations (2.5 10\nto 2.5 10\nm.)\n\nis achieved by the use of piezoelectric strain transducers mounted on-the sensor\narms.

In this case, the fluid rotational velocity\nat the sink must be sensed in some manner and used to drive a fluid amplifier*\nIn general, however, the relative merits of pickoffs can be measured with\nrespect to sensitivity, inherent noise generation and output power. The\n\n-.\n\nweighting factors associated with each characteristic are a function of the\n\n,\' \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\napplication; therefore, ho order of rank may be given. .\n\n- ";:\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNoise generation in the coupling element can also present a problem.\nAlthough the amplitude of the noise may be small, it will be amplified by the\nsensor in the same manner as the signal.\nPresent Status\nThe feasibility of the vortex rate sensor has already been demonstrated\nin providing rate damping signals in an aircraft control system,and has also been\nused in conjunction with a fluid integrator to provide an attitude reference on\nan experimental missile control system. In both cases, test flights were highly\nsatisfactory.\n,\n\n\'\n\nThe operation of the sensor has been demonstrated on both liquids and\n\ngases. The operation of the sensor with sea water as the fluid medium offers a\n\nwide potential for naval applications. Ram air or water can provide free power\nin many cases. Compensation techniques to reduce supply pressure and temperature\nsensitivity are proving successful, and should permit the vortex sensor to operate\nunder environments prohibitive to conventional sensors. The sensor can be\nmade Insensitive to radiation, thus could be used on a nuclear-powered vehicle \'.\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2"\nwith no shielding. The low mass of the fluid minimizes acceleration sensitivity,\n:\n\nmaking the vortex sensor an ideal instrument for high "G" environments.\n\\\n\nThe vortex rate sensor is rather unique among the "unconventional"\nsensors in that its eventual use will be determined primarily on the extent of the\napplication of "fluid amplifier technology."\n\nAlthough operational experience\n\nis limited at this time, development tests have been encouraging.\n\nThe dynamic,;.\n\nperformance of units presently under development covers control frequencies\n\n.;\'\xe2\x80\xa2"\n\nof 5 hz or less.

This type of approach probably optimizes\nthe search for microminiaturized "electromechanical" type sensors compatible\nwith electronic microclrcuitry. This last section lists some of the very\nattractive ideas being stuc\'ied by Jacobs and his co-workers at Autonetics.\n\njjejicon Gyro\nThe helicon gyro concept can be described as a circularly polarized\n\n-:\n\nelectromagnetic wave that propagates with extremely slow phase velocity along v\n.\'\xe2\x80\xa2\' the magnetic field lines of a plasma. Helicon wave frequencies as low as a\nfraction of a cycle per second have been detected in a small sample of sodium. \xe2\x80\xa2\nSince the frequency of the circularly polarized waves should be determined by\nthe physical properties of the plasma alone, the measurement in inertia! space\nof this frequency would be independent of the state of rotation of the solid.\n\n\\\n\nIf/ however, the measurements were made in a rotating frame of reference, the\nfrequency would be shifted by the rotation rate. Hence, rotation rate might be\nmeasured as a shift in helicon frequency. Because helicon frequencies are\nlow, and frequencies can be measured with great precision, a sensitive rate\nsensor should result.\n\nBy choosing two helicon waves in two plasmas with opposite\n\nfields, the vehicle rotation could be produced as a direct output of the sensor.\nSuch a device has no moving mechanical parts, and has the virtues of simple\nconstruction, and small volume. It would have no g sensitivity and, hence,\nhave utility as a high g and rate device.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 - " - \' Diode Loser Accelerometer\n\n,\n\nAn Interesting acceleration sensing device has been designed taking\n\n:\n\n"\n\n\'\n\n:\n\nadvantage of the properties of solid state injection diode lasers.

Solid-state oscillatory effects can be conveniently\ndivided into four areas:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nc\n\n1. Radio frequency ferromagnetic resonance in uniaxial\nmagnetic thin films,\n.\n2. Magnetoacoustic resonance,\nf.\n\n.\n\n\'\n\n3. Current oscillations in semi-conductors,\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4.\n\nSolid-state plasma.\n\nL\n\nRadio frequency ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in uniaxial magnetic\nthin films may be applied to acceleration-sensing by utilizing the high magnetoelastic sensitivities of certain uniaxial films and by utilizing the high stress\nsensitivity of FMR to the angle between an applied field and the anisotropy\nself-field in the film. In terms of Q, the Q of FMR is already rather high,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2?\xe2\x80\xa2\',.\n\nbut coupled with the higji angular sensitivity, the Q is enhanced by several\norders of magnitude. A stress-sensor of high resolution is therefore anticipated,\nMagnetoacoustic resonance is a phenomenon observed at microwave\nfrequencies rather than radio frequencies in materials which have both high-Q\nmagnetic modes and acoustic modes which are rather tightly coupled.\n\nThe\n\n., .\'\n\nfrequency range over which the effect has been observed is from 1 to 10 gHz.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe sample size is about 0.25 x 10\n\n~.\n\nm.\n\nthreshold of approximately 3 milliwatts\nacoustic modes can be excited.\n\nFor pump powers above a\nboth magnetostatic modes and\n\nThe strong effect of the stress-field upon the\n\n;\n\nacoustic frequency will be communicated to the magnetic system through the\nelectron spin-phonon interaction. The effect of stress may then be observed\nindirectly through its effect on FMR frequency/ which can be determined with\ngood precision.\nCurrent oscillation in semiconductors ts. another area in which application\nmay be made to a stress-sensor. Small size is again possible; the sensing\n-2\nmaterial itself may be a cube 10 cm on a side. The high-Q oscillation,\nwhich exists after a threshold value of electric field; (about 1000 volts/cm)\nis applied across the sample, depends on both sample dimensions and material\nproperties.\n\nBoth are expected to change sensitively with stress.\n\n\\ i(9)\n\nREFERENCES\ni\n\nt\n\nHe.* icon Gyro\n.\ni\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94^\xe2\x80\x94\nBowers, R,y and ofhers, "Oscillatory gaivanomagnenc evfect in metallic\nsodium," Physical Beview Uiters, Vol.\n\nChambers/ R.
