The operating principles and structure of optically and electron beam addressed DKDPs are compared, and specifications for both devices given. Optically addressed DKDPs are capable of higher resolution and contrast, but both systems represent viable real time spatial light modulators adaptable to optical processing. Examples of real time data processing performed by the DKDPs include: image addition and subtraction; reduction of noise introduced by scattered light in recording media; reconstruction of computer generated and acoustic holograms; reconstruction of synthetic aperture radar data; retrieval of three-dimensional information in X-ray diagnoses; radar signal processing and display; and optical pattern recognition and correlation of images, which has applications for missile guidance systems.", "title": "DKDP /potassium dideuterium phosphate/ light valves", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T01:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770058663, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Casasent, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Carnegie-Mellon University", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pa., United States"}}, "id": "204b758540284a5c9600059e8779ea33"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19770058663, "publications": [{"volume": "16", "submissionId": 19770058663, "id": "67d24e71ac3043e4bf7937b0048aaae7", "publicationName": "Optical Engineering", "publicationDate": "1977-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
