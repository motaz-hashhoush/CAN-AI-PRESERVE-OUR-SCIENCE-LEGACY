Monitoring of parameters that truly reflect the degree of injury to the nervous system is another goal. Thus, two themes for the coming decade in neuromonitoring will be: (1) less-invasive monitoring; and (2) parameters that more closely reflect the etiological factors in ischemic or other neuroinjury. In this paper, we review neuromonitoring techniques and devices that can be used readily in the operating room or intensive care unit setting. Those that require transport of the patient to a special facility (e.g., for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy) and those that have been in standard practice for neuromonitoring (e.g., electrophysiological monitoring--EEG, evoked potentials) are not considered. The two techniques considered in detail are (1) continuous multiparameter local brain tissue monitoring with microprobes, and (2) non-invasive continuous local brain tissue oxygenation monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy. Both techniques have been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use. The rationale for their use, the nature of the devices, and clinical results to date are reviewed. It is expected that both techniques will gain wide acceptance during the coming decade; further advances in neuromonitoring that can be expected further into the twenty-first century are also discussed.", "title": "Monitoring for neuroprotection.
