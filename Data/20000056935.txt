We de_ribe a mall Hg* imt hap based\nfrequency standard with an extended linear ion trap (LITE) architecture which seperat_ the optical state\nselection region from the clock resomu_ region. This seperation allows the use of novel trap configurations in\nthe resonance region since no optical pumping is carried out there. A method for measuring the _ze of an ion\ncloud inside a finest trap with a 12-rod trap is currently being investigated. At ~10 "n, the 2 "aorder Doppler shift\nfor trapped mercury ion freqttency standards is one of the largest frequency offsets end its measurement to the 1% level would represent an advance in insuring the very long-term stability of these standards to the 10 "14\nox\nbetter level. Finally, we describe atomic clock comparison experiments that can probe for a time variation of the\nfine structure constant, a = e2/2xhc, at the level of 10"_/year as predicted in some Grand Unified Slrin 8 Theories.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nA small, continuously\noperating atomic clock with stability of 10 _5 or better would advance the art and science\nspacecraft navigation in deep space and enable space-based tests of general relativity that far exceed the sensitivities\n\nof\nof\n\nearth-based\ntests. Similarly, continuously\noperating earth-based\nclocks with stability approaching\n10 "_6for averaging\nintervals between I000 and I0,000 seconds would enhance the search for low frequency gravitational\nwaves via careful\nDoppler tracking of the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn. These goals have defined and shaped the technologies\nused for the development\nof the ultra-stable\nlinear ion trap Hg + at the JPL Frequency Standards Lab. Because io_ in a\n--rig runs into me t\'=_ ground bypeffme leve_ m a second or so. Pumpmg into tl_ state proceeds _th _\n_\nof only a few uv photons per ion and thus, a hi,gh signal-to-noise\nratio in the nmmued\ndock resonance can o_y be\nachieved with large ion clouds, typically with 10 \xc2\xb0 to 10" ions. Motivated by these constraints,\nwe first recognized and\ndeveloped the linear ion trap [1] for storage of ion clouds that were ten or more times larger than could be stored in a\nconventional\nPaul trap. Because the linear trap replaces the point node of the Paul trap with a line of nodes, there is no\nincrease in Doppler shift from the excess ff micro-motion\ncaused by space charge repulsion of ions from the vicinity of\n\nthe node region.\nWe have built 10 fxeqnency standards based on Hg ions in a linear trap, seven of the style shown in Figure 1 (LITS)\n[2] and three of the extended type (LITE) [3] as shown in Figure 4. Both the LITS and the LITE architectures have\ndemonstrated frequency stability well into the 10"l_-stability range.\n\nRECENT\n\nRESULTS\n\nWITH\n\nLITS/CSO\n\nCOMBINATION\n\nFigure I shows the configuration\nfor the original Linear Ion Trap Standard (LITS). Ions arc loaded into the trap with\nan electron pulse injected along the trap axis that ionizes a vapor of isotopically enriched tg_I-Ig atoms at a pressme of\n10 \xc2\xa2 "Ion"or less. This low pressure vapor is generated by heating a mercuric oxide (HgO) powder to 200C or higher.\n\nWith a background base vacuum system pressure of a few xl0 "_\xc2\xb0Tort, ion-trapping times of a few hours can be\nachieved.\n\nFILAMENT\n\nTO VACUUM\n\nFIGURg 1. The linear ion trap based frequency standard is shown above. The tntp is housed in a titanium\nvacuumcube. The molybdenumtrap rods are 5 mm in diameterand are mounted on a 20.3 mm circle. The endcap\nelectrodes are separated by 75 ram. State selection light from a _\ndischarge lamp enters from the right, is\nfocused onto the camtnd 1/3 of the trapped ions, and is collected in the horn. Fluorescence from the ions is\ncollected in both directions normalto the page.\n\nThe LITS has shown excellent signal-to-noise in the measured clock transition and is determined by the size of the ion\nresonance line and the level of stray light output from the 2\xc2\xb02Hg lamp. Signal levels as high as 80,000 with a\nbackground stray light rate of about 180,000 have been measured in a 1.5-second collection interval with dual\nfluorescence collection optical modules. These signal levels were measured with an 8 second Ramsey interrogation of\nthe 40.5 GHz Hg+ clock transition and will yield a clock performance \xc2\xa2_y(x)= 2xl0"14/_/x as calculated from signal-tonoise and line Q. This short term perfonmn_\nexceeds the noise level for all but the very best short tmn stable\noscillators, even the best H-masers available in our lab.\nRecently, a clTogeni\xc2\xa2 compensated sapphire oscillator (CSO) [4] has been develol_\nin our lab and has been used to\nmeasure the un-degrnded L1TS performance. This continuously o nting ctyo-cooled liquid Helium refrigerated\nsapphire cavity oscillator delivers short-term stability of a few xl\nto a few hundred seconds and is adequate to\nmeasure the ion standard short term performance. The LITS standard is m_\nto the Compensated\nOscillator [4] as shown in the schematic configuration of Figure 2. During this measurement the LITS calculated\nstability from signal-to-noise and line-Q was approximately 3xlO"4/_x as was measure(LThis shows that for short-term\nperformance there are no additional noise sources larger than shot noise of the total collected uv lighL\nAnother measurement shown schematically in Figure 2 is steering the CSO to follow the ion clock resonance and\ncompare that mttpet to a SAO hydrogen maser. This shows that the LITS-CSO combination at 3xl0"14/_x, exceeds the\nhydrogen tnas_ stability for all averaging time intervals over the duration of this measurement. This measurement was\ncarried out with a large ion cloud with a second order Doppler shift of over l0 "12 and consequently, a potential for noise\nsourceshem Doppler instabilities. For this reason and in order to reducethe size of the L1TS we have changed the\narchitecture of the LITS clock to exploit the mobility of charged ions and that they can be electrically transported\nhem\none end of a linear trap to another.\n\n40.50734799xx\n\nGHz\n\n[\n\n100MHz-I\n\n.\n\nT\n_\n\nIHz\n\nVS.\n\nCSO\nFrequency error\n\nSapphire Oscillator\nC_yogenic\n\n_\n\nLITS\n\nLrTS\nComputer\n\nHg+ Linear\nIon Trap\n\nI\n\n<\n\n\'_"\n\nTime\nInten_\n\nL\n\n_LITS/CSO\n\nVS.\n\nH-Ma_\n\nElpre Z Sdmnafic ofthe med_ reed to metsm_ the LITS _ort-tenn frequency_ility\nqaimt theultraruble cxyo.cooled sapph_ mciUator.Abo _own here is the measmement of the frequencystability of the\nIJ13/CSO combination competed to the mbility of a hydrose,,,maser.\n\n1E-12\n\n1E-13\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,\n\nL rs/c_o\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n3x10 __z\nu=\n\nIIii\n\n5\n\nUTSva C80\n\n1E-15\n\nvu H-n,-- ,,\n\n\\\n\n!\n\n|I\n\n1E-16\n1E-I\n\nR\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIIIIJ\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIJIll\n\nO 4)\n\n.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nIJllJ_\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI\n\nIlllJ\n\n.......................\n\n1E+O\n\n1E+I\n\n1E+2\n\n1E+3\n\n1E+4\n\n1E+5\n\n1E+6\n\nMeasuring Time (seconds)\n\nEItlre & The _Allm\nDeviatioa ofthe LIT3 vs CSO(inverted\n_im_les) andtheLrrs steefi_ theCSO\nvs a _\nmaxf (circles_ The LITS vs CSOdatt demonstrates\nthatfor thneslemthan200 second&\nwhere\nthe CSO is better th,m the LITS, the LITS stability is 3xlO"41V\'c, ettertim any lmmive atomic frequency\nb\nmndsrd luredmnmmmted, la the second mmsmement shown hm_ the L1TSsteen the CSO to remove its\ndqnxlinl mdxlity beyond\n200 m:ondt The LITS/CSO\xc2\xa2ombimtimexceeds\nH-maKr mbih\'ty for the denttio, of\nthe_t\ninterval.\n\nLINEAR\n\nION TRAP\n\nEXTENDED\n\n(LITE)\n\nOne mod/flcation to the LITS architecture that we are investigating\nis the extended linear ion trap shown in Figure 4.\nThis layout pan/t/one a linear trap into an optical interrogation\nregion, similar to that shown in Figure I, and adds an\nextens/cm to carry out the microwave clock transition.

The shift of the clock\ntransition\nwithapplied agnak\nm\nfield is quadratic, v = vo + cxiI2 where H is the total applied field and = is the semitivity factor, ct = 97 Hz/Gau_ - 97\n_z/mO 2 for the "_g+ clock transition. If the field is the laun of a static homogenecms field, Ho, along the trap axis\nand the transverse quadrupole field, Itx(r), from the four auxilimy trap rods we find v = Vo + cx (He + &(r))= = Vo +\nedge2 + aitz 2. Since bz(r) = h\'(_ y + j3 x) and therefore, Iti 2 - Ca\')2p , the magnetic shift of the clock mmsition\n2\ngrows qmalratic_\nwith dimnce from the node line.

The quantities which determine (p=) are ion number,\nion temigtatu_\nand the trap rf level and its resulting secular hequet_,\nm,,,. For a fixed secular frequency and buffer\ngas pressure, ion number and temperature are not independent thus a measurement of (p2) could be used to servo the\nelectron emission to hold the ion number (and temperature) constanL\nTo estimme the size ofthe shi_ suppme (p=) = 1 mm= and h\' = 20 mG/mm. The shi_q when the quadrupole field of\nthis strength is switched on is 97 laJ-Iz/mG= I mm= = 400 mG2/mm == 40 mHz which corresponds to a 1 x 10"n shiR\nx\n\nof the clock transition. With a trap radius R., 5 nun the field gradient produced at the center is h\'., (_o r)/(n R=) ,, 20\nmG/mm at a quadrupole excitation current of I = 125 mA. Even with (p=) = 0. l mm 2 , a 400 mA current will produce\na 10"_=clock shift. A clock with 10"_]/_/xshort term s\',Jbility will measure this offset to about 1% in a few minutes of\naveraging time, _.\n1"2 Relaxation\n\nin hi field gradient\n\nOne problem that must be avoided with this technique is relaxation of the high Q clock transition in the field gradient\nof the quadrupole magnetic field, h\xc2\xb1(r). This method depends upon the clock transition shifting an amount\nproportional to (O2} with little or no reduction in the signal size and line-Q Ion motion in the applied field gradient can\nmix the two Zceman states F ffi 1, n_ = \xc2\xb1 1 with the upper clock state F ffi 1, m_ = 0 and cause a rapid relaxation of the\ncoherence between the two clock levels F =1, mF =0 and F = O, mF ffi0. The frequency spacing to these Zccman levels\nincreases at _=1.4 kHz per mG of applied field 114,, hich is typically about 50mG.\nw\nThe trajectory of an ion in the p, 0 plane determines the spectrum of time variation of the quadrupole field, h_(r). The\ncoherence in the clock transition will relax rapidly as this spectrum overlaps with the Zeeman states at COo 4-y Ho,\n=\nwhere ?/2z = 1.4 kHz/mG. Harmonic motion through the trap center leads to a magnetic field variation at the secular\nfrequency of the trap, ram. These are the \'free particle\' limits. When space-charge repulsion is important (as for a huge\ncloud), these fi_quendes move down. Thus, it would appear that to avoid relaxation via mixing with the Zeeman states\nwe must run the static field H, high enough so that 7 Ho > co,._. As the static field is increased the clock transition\ngrows more sensitive to field variations and the clock is potentially less stable.\nRelaxation rates to the Zeeman states from the upper clock state can be estimated from ram"relaxation rotes given inthe Redfield theory [5,6]. The time dependent magnetic field seen by an ion moving in the field gradient of h\xc2\xb1(r) can\nhave spectra] overlap with the frequency splitting to the Zeeman states O_o + -f He thereby transferring atoms into this\n=\nstate. In this estimate, the rate at which this occurs is assumed to be the same as the rate of coherence loss in the clock\ntransition. The transfer of population occurs at a rate Tl\'1 = 72 Ca,)2 (Sx(COo) Sy(O_o))/2where we have used [ V Fix[2=\n+\n] V I-_ [2= (h,)2 in the notation of ref [5]. The spectrum of the time variation of the field gradient seen by the moving\nion S_(co) = Sy(co) ~ (21_T/mo_m2Xto(to\'2+(o_ - C0m)2)) Iis assumed to be a Lorentzian shape centered on the ion secular\n"\nfxequency, m,._, with width determined by the ion collision rate, to_, which changes the phase of the ion secular motion\nwithin the trap. The spectrum is derived from a harmonic oscillator which is randomly re-p_\nat an average time\ninterval of to. These collisions could be with other atoms or ions, or could be with the trap end confinement fields where\neach mrn-aronnd at the end cap field will disrupt the secular frequency phase. The coII/sions must be of sufficient\nstrength to randomize the phase of the harmonic secular motion. The mean square amplitude of the transverse motion\nis 2ksT/mco, 2 = (p2), determined by the secular confinement and the ion temperature, T. We re-write the population\nrate transfer in terms of the frequency shift when the quadrupole field is applied, 8v = oc(p2)(h\') 2, as Ti"l w 72\n(Sv/ct)(to(to\'z+(mo - axe):)) "i. Taking to - 1 msec, C0o-C0m 2x 50 kI-Iz,and 8v : 40 mHz, we find that Tlt _ 300/see, a\n=\nvery rapid loss of coherence in the clock transition.\nOne posm\'ble solution to this near resonance relaxation is to apply the quadrupole field at a fn:quency, _ much higher\nthan the secular frequency, com... Since along the path of the ion trajectory, hl(r(t)) = h\'(_ y + ._ x) = ho\'coef/t\n(yosincomt 3_ + xesin(a_mt + _)._), the frequencies of the quadrupole field seen by the moving ion are now up-shifted to\n+ corn which can be 10 or more times higher than 7 He to avoid the mixing to the Zeeman states and loa of\ncoherence in the clock transition. In this case the dominant frequency seen by the moving ion is - _ so that 1"1 _ 72\n_\n(Sv/ccXto(to\'=+(mo- G)2))-I. If the quadrupole field is applied at 2 MHz the relaxation rate is, TI1 m 0.2/see, much\nslower than with the de quadrupole current and thereby preserving the line Q and signal size.\n\nCLOCK\n\nCOMPARISONS\n\nTO TEST\n\nFOR\n\nALPHA\n\nVARIATION\n\nA stringent test of modem grand unified theories can be carried out in laboratory clock frequency comparisons. Some\ntheories [rofl predict a slow time variation of the fine structure constant, oc= e_/2xhc, due to the expansion of the\nuniverse. Because ez describes the strength of electromagnetism, its time variation would lead to a slow time variation\nof nil atomic energy level spacings. There have been several attempts to find a changing cz by comparing clocks or\n\nspectral _\nof different "eleotmmaguetic competition" that is, atomic tmmifions which have a different depeadenm\non or.Thu& a microwave superconducting cavity mciilator fi_quency wu compared to a hydrogen nutaer traction\nfrequency [7], fine a_uetute intervals in Mg were compared to the hydrogen maser interval [8], and more recently,\nmultiple q_ectml _\nfrom quasars with large colmological redshifla were compared [9]. In the quasar spectral data,\nthere is evidence that during the early universe ordiffered from its present day value by &odo_= -2.64(:1:0.35)x10 "s.\nAlthough among the moat precise meamm:mentJ carried out, atomic clock rate comparisons were thought to be\nimemitive to any change in ct since it was believed that all hyperfine clock tramitiom _:aled with c_ in the mine\nmanner. We recently showed [10] that the relativistic hyperflne interaction mengly violate, the uniformity _mding\nwith ct 1, the atomic munber Z of the clock atom increases. Thus a changing fine structure constant would force a\nfractional frequency change between the hydrogen hyperfine frequency, v_m_,\nfrequency, v_aha, acooniing to [10]\n\nand an alkali atom or ion hyperflne\n\n-(vhere X_.
