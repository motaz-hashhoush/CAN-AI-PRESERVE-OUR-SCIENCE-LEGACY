Metallic additive manufacturing is an emerging\nform of rapid prototyping that allows complex structures to be built using various metallic powders.\nSignificant time and cost savings have also been observed using the metallic additive\nmanufacturing compared with traditional techniques.\nDevelopment of the metallic additive manufacturing technology has advanced significantly over\nthe last decade, although many of the techniques to inspect parts made from these processes\nhave not advanced significantly or have limitations. Several external geometry inspection\ntechniques exist such as Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM), Laser Scanners, Structured\nLight Scanning Systems, or even traditional calipers and gages. All of the aforementioned\ntechniques are limited to external geometry and contours or must use a contact probe to inspect\nlimited internal dimensions.\nThis presentation will document the development of a process for real-time dimensional inspection\ntechnique and digital quality record of the additive manufacturing process using Infrared camera\nimaging and processing techniques.\n\n\xc2\xbe\n\nBy submitting an abstract, you agree to both complete a final paper for publication and to attend the meeting to present this information.\n\n\xc2\xbe\n\nSubmit abstracts electronically; submittal instructions are found in the call for papers.\n\n\xc2\xbe\n\nDirect questions to .DWKOHHQ %LJODUL, by phone at 410.992.730\x13 x \x15\x13\x1b, or email to NELJODUL#FSLDF\x11MKX\x11HGX.\n\n'
