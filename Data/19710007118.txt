The recommendations and conclusions (Task E) are\nincluded in a separate section.\n\n-\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\n2.0\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA critical analysis of the data generated during the Bell\nAerospace Company\'s.LM Ascent Engine Development Program was\nconducted to isolate and correlate the circumstances under which\nlow frequency oscillations were noted.\nPrevious analysis conducted duying the development program\nhad indicated that sensitivity was a function of the fuel propellant circuit, chamber pressure (for a fixed configuration), and\nthe qua,ntity of helium in the fuel. The fuel circuit was\nidentified as a controlling parameter in a series of tests where\nhelium was injected into the individual propellant lines. No\nsignificant response was detected from the oxidizer system-while\ninjection of helium into the fuel system proddced LFO1s.\n\n,\n\nThere appear to be discrete fuel pressure drop values below\nwhich L F O 1 s are always produced. The specific value is related\nto the helium saturation of the fuel. This critical pressure (CAP)\nis also influepced by tQe particular cell in which the tests\nwere conducted. At an overall injector pressure drop below 27\npsi, all injectors tested produced a start "football". It was\ndetermined furthermore that the pressure drop across the injector\norifices is the most sensitive portion of the overall value. An\norifice critical pressbre drop value of appro~imately21 psi was\nfound to exist when the propellants were sathrated with helium at\nthe maximum LM tank pressure level. , ,\nThe available data were derived from tests in which\npropellants containing substantial amount of helium were used.\nSustained L F O 1 s were not found with propellants that had not\nbeen exposed to an helium pressure environment above chamber\npressure. Furthermore, it was observed that "footballs" become\nmore predominant as pressurization methods were used which would\ntrap or contain greater quantities of helium.\n\nA significant amount of evidence is evolving which indicates\nthat, at least over pertinent portions of the operating regime,\nthe critical pressure drop and the local gas evolution potential\nare directly related. This means that the critical pressure drop\nincreases as the helium satura,tionlevel of the fueJ. circuit is\nincreased.\nIn terms of these observations, one can t.herefore propose\nan explanation for the occurrence of start "footballsf\',whieh\nmust answer sucki questions as: Why are "~ootballs"of limited\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\ntime duration and how are they related to continuous low frequency\noscillations? It can be shown that the start "football" is\nrepresentative of the period of time when "dirty" fuel, produced\nby the outgassing during the transient period, passes through the\ninjector. Obviousl.y, the lower the initial saturation level of\nthe propellant, the smaller is the likelihood of a transient\n11\nfootball" and vice versa. \' The cross-correlationship between the\ninjector pressure drop and the level of "dirtiness" of the propellant becomes evident from such observations that for the same\ninjector configuration, the start "football" duration at the same\nchamber pressure would increase as the helium saturation level\niz increased; similarly it also increases as the chamber pressure\nis decreased for propellants conditioned to the same saturation\nvalue. The same general relationship has also been observed for\ncontinuous oscillations. Below a given critical pressure drop,\nstabilization cannot be achieved if a saturation level corresponding to 190 psi exists in the fuel; however, normal operation\nproceeds if the saturation level is, for example, lowered to 140\npsi. It would appear, theref\'ore, that the start "football" and\nthe continuous oscillations are aspects of the same mechanism.\nIn either case, they represent states when the orifice pressure\ndrop of the injector becomes too low to stabilize the existing\nlevel of "dirtiness" of the fuel passing through the injeqtor.\nIn either case, thermodynamic states exist where large evolution\nof helium can occur, For the start "football", this is caused\nty the temporary low ambient pressure seen during the start\ntransient by the propellant downstream of thebtrim orifices. The\nsaturation levels at which continuous oscillations have been\nobserved correspond to conditions,where gas evolution can readily\noccur as pressure drops are encountered anywhere in the system.\nIt appears that a functional relationship exists, at ranges of\nhelium saturation which allow local tpo-phase condition at the\ninjector orifices to occur, which takes the form\n\nwhere\nCAp is the critical orifice pressure drop.\nis the local gas evolution potential. \'\n\nPP\nK is a constant for a given injector.\nF represents a function\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nThe examination of the photographfc data for the single\nelement combustion sheds further light on these considerations.\nWhen helium was injected into the upstream fuel circuit, oscillations in the liquid streams, the impingin\'g point and the combustion\npattern could be observed. These oscillations were not at the\nsame frequency as the main chamber LFOts, however the existence\nof the osci,-lations\nsuggests that the coupling between the injector\norifice flow and the combustion is the mechanism producing the\nsustained oscillations and that the gas (helium) content is the\nsustaining trigger.\nThe examination of the Bell Analogue Model indicated that\nwhile LFO1s could be produced by manipulation of injector drop\nand propellant acoustic velocity assumption, a critical pressure\ndrop value could not be derived. The inclusion of this cciteria\ninto the model then became the recommendation for the Phase I1\neffort. The additional recommendations include a further examination of the method of coupling producing the sustained o~cillations.\nThe three methods of coupling suggested for further examination\ninclude:\n1.\n\nAs a result of helium evolution, the discharge\ncoefficient, C , of the fuel injection orifices\nchanges discon?inuously at \'a given value of back\npressure or AP. The resultant stream emission\noscillation produces a~variablerate of combustion.\n\\\n\n2.\n\nAs a result of helium evolution, element blow apart,\nchanging the combustion rate and spatial location,\noccurs in a discrete manner as the pressure drop or\nvelocity of the fuel jet varies.\n\n3. The fuel propellant manifold upstream of the propellant\norifices and the combustion reaction zone form a\nresonant system. The free gas content in the fuel\nmodifies the acoustic velocity of the fluid.\nThe portion of this program devoted to the analyses of\napplicable analogue models was conducted exclusively on the\nanalogue model constructed by BAC and utilized to investigate\nthe LFO phenomena during the LM ascent engine development program.\nThe review and analysis of this model has indicated its\nability to provide corre1atit)n with test data in the following\nareas:\n1, Simulate the LFO Er)eyuency,\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\n2, Correlate with fuel system variations and LFO\n\noccurrence,\n\n3. Correlate the observation that increased chamber\n\n,\n\npressure reduces LFO incidence.\nThe BAC analogue model has also been shown to have the ability\nof simulating what the work statement defines as basic requirements of a model. These requirements include the ability of\nthe model to simulate the following conditions and parameters.\na.\n\nHelium saturated propellants.\n\nb.\n\nThe pressure drops and volumes in various parts\nof the injector.\n\nc.\n\nThe pressure drops and volumes in various parts1\nof the propellant feed lines, valve, and test\nstand.\n\nd.\n\nChanges in operating conditions such as mixture\nratio, chamber pressure, propellant temperatures,\nacoustic velocities, Impingement angles,fuel and\noxidizer propc?llants leads .,\n\ne.\n\nCombustion dynamics such as prbpellant stay times,\ncombustion i,gnition delay.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nAs discussed previously, it had been established as a\nresult of tests conducted during the LM ascent engine development program that the occurrence of low frequency chamber\npressure oscillations are related to the fuel propellant circuit\nand become more sensitive at low chamber pressure and in the\npresence of helium in the fuel. Utilizing this information,\nthe existing test data were reviewed and correlations attempted\nin order to define the controlling parameters and the basic\nmechanisms that produce the low frequency oscillations.\n,\n\nAnalysis Results of Task A\nThis effort consisted of the review and -correlation of\npast engine data. During this task, many correlations were\nattempted in order to isolate the variables that influence the\noccurrence of both start and continuous low frequency oscillations. The approach taken was to examine the components and\nvariables of the fuel circuit and assess their influence insofar\nie\nas this was possible with t l existing data. The subdivisions\nof the fuel circuit examined are as follows:\n\nA.\n\nI\n\nInjector Influence\n11\n2\n\nMBnifold type\nManifold volume\n\ndrop\nB.\n\nJ\n\nI\n\nFeed System Inf\'lucric~es\nLine length\nLine volume\nLine pressure drop\n4) Prepurge\n5) System response\n\n1)\n\nChamber pressure\n\n2) Feed pressure\n\nPropellant temperature\nMixture ratio\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nD, Helium Influences\nHelium injection\nCirculation method\nThe only significant correlation relative to injector\ninfluences which could be established was with fuel injector\npressure drop. This correlation showed that within a given test\ncell with a given type of helium gas saturation, low frequency\noscillations were eliminated when the fuel injector pressure\ndrop was increased above a critical~value( ~ i g u r e1). This\nvalue of fuel injector pressure drop was independent of injector\nmanifold volume, manifold type, baffle type, oxidizer lead, flow\nrate or design pressure drop. Figure 2 indicates the extremes\nanalyzed in injector type.\nI\n\nThe value of critical fuel pressure drop was influenced by\nihe particular test cell used. Figure 3 is a plot of critical\nfuel pressure drop for each test cell. The analysis conducted\nto determine the test cqll feed s stem influences (extreme in\nfeed system are shown in Figure 47 indicated that ,the most\nsignificant correlation was with the system response parameters\nof fuel feed pressure recovery time and fuel transient flow\n(~igure\n5). These effects are *understandable when one examines\nthe variations in system response noted in the fuel feed pressure\nFigure 6.\nThe test ckll effect Mas considered to be the result of\nthe low static pqessure the fuel encounters immedtately after\nopening the propellant valve. As the fuel is accelerated the\nline pressure decreases until a limiting flow is established.\nThe static pressure at this fTow condition is substantially lower than\ntank pressure and often below chamber pressure. If gas is\nentrained at a tank pressure value of saturation, the lower\npressure would allow the gas to come out of solution, producing\nan oscillating injection of gas and fuel. The qualifying\ninfluence is the rate the gas goes back into solution after the\ninitial chamber pressure rise. The entrained gas in the fuel\nat start was affected by the response of the test cell and was\nconsidered totally responsible for the different start respcnse\ntraces shown in Figure 6.\nThe operating conditions analyzed failed to yield additional\ncorrelations. The propellant temperature did appear to be an\ninfluencing parameter; however, these data were masked by the\ndifference between hardware temperature and propellant temperature.\nThe tests conducted with off-nominal propellant temperatures did\nnct incorporate hardware temperature conditioning. Therefore,\n\nm o o\n- - -\n\n,\n\n.\n.\n\n- 3 l W l S AUV31S \' ~ M / I N ~ S N V U ~N\n1\nI!\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nthe effect of the propellant temperature was masked by the\nnonequilibrium heat transfer condition taking place during the\nstart transient.\nThe examination of the helium saturation methods Figure 7)\nshowed a significant variation in test results (Figure $1.\nThe\nexamination of Figure 8 indicates that no continuous L F O t s\nwould be expected under normal circumstances if a saturation\npressure of 50 psi were used. The figure also shows that a\nLFO would be expected for a saturation pressure of 190 psi when\nthe flow rates (AP) was reduced below 4.2 lb/sec.\nExamination of data from various types of injectors\ntested at the 190 psi saturation level has defined the value\nof the critical pressure drop at which continuous low frequency\noscillations are produced. Figure 9 is a tabulation of these\ninjectors and their pressure drops during continuous low\nfrequency oscillations. From this figure we can see that the\ninjection orifice pressuFe drop is approximately 21 psi for all\nunits examined.\nOn this basis some concluding observation~s\nwere listed\nrelated to helium saturation. These observations are as\nfollows:\n1.\n\nContinuous LFO for the same configuration, tested\nat the same facility, disappear as the helium\nsaturation level is decreased.\n\n2.\n\nStart LFO at the same operating test conditions get\nlonger as the saturation level increases.\n\n3.

These Qere high speed photography\nof a single triplet (two fuel on one oxidizer) of the type used\non the BAC injector. The objective of this test series was to\nobserve the effect when helium was injected into the fuel.\nDuring the test program, three conditions were examined:\n\nI.\n\nTriplet with no helium injection.\n\n2.\n\nTriplet with 0.1 percent helium injection in the\'fuel.\n\n3. Triplet with 0.2 percent helium injection in the fuel.\nThe film generated during the above t\'ests was examined\nframe by frame and measurements were made in the areas of the\nliquid jet, the impingement area and the fan breakup zone to\ndetermine any variations due to helium injection.\nThe examination of these films yielded many interesting\nobservations (~igure\n10). The visual review of the data clearly\nindicated a significant variation in the thrke cases. With no\nhelium injection the liquid jets were steady with no apparent\npulsing or oscillations. The impingement point showed steady\nimpingement at a constant height, and the,fan breakup was steady\nwith the breakup area (assutned to be the point where the fan\nbecame transparent\') steady and nonoscillating. The results with\n0.1 percent helium yielded a significant variation in all areas\nexamined. The liquid jets indic6ted an oscillatory and pulsing\nphenomena with the average stream diameter being much smaller.\nThe impingement point show@ a movement on the average away from\nthe injector and appeared to oscillate in a periodic manner.\nThe fan breakup was also moved downstream and oscillated at a\nrate of 1000 cps (~igure\n11). The results with 0.2 percent\nhelium showed again a drastic change in characteristics. The\nliquid jets were smaller in diameter1 than the no helium and the\n0.1 percent helium although now the streams were steady with no\nindications of pulsing or oscillation. The impingement point\nwas moved further downstream and the post impingement fan\nbreakup appears to be retarded. This is surmised on the basis\nof the complete lack of any,observable fan breakup.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nIn order to determine further if a predominant f\'requency\ncould be defined in the impingement point fluctuations under\nthe 0.1 percent condition, a frame-by-frame analysis was conducted.\nThe data for this comparison were collected by measuring the\nimpingement distance on two-hundred consecutive frames for the\nno-helium and the 0.1 percent helium cases. A Fourier analysis\nwas conducted on the tabulated measurements. The results of the\nFourier analysis indicated that some frequency components in the\nL 0 cps range were identifiable in the 0.1 percent case while\nl0\nnone were noted in the no-helium case ( ~ i g u r e12). The frequency\ndata generated for the 0.1 percent helium case was compared to\nthe frequency content of a typical LFO measured during engine\ntesting. Figure 13 shows this comparison. It is interesting to\nnote that the frequency content iq almost identical.\nIt can therefore bg concluded that the helium injected\ninto the fuel has the following effects.\n1. Reduces the liquid stream diameter and causes the\nstreams to pulse. ~ x e r k sa significant effect -on the appearance\nof the fuel jets. At one condition of injection rate (0.1 percent)\nthe jet diakneter undergoes nearly periodic diameter variations.\nAt larger values of!helium injection (0.2 percent) the flow\nappears steady. However, the jet diameter is considerably smaller\nthan under no-helium injection condi~ions.\n2. Influences the steadiness and possibly the nature of\nthe triplet impingement. \'one level of helium injection (0.1\npercent) produced oscillatory variations in impimgement that\ncontained the same frequency content of an engine produced LFO.\n\n3. Effects the Fan Breakup,\n, \\\n\nThe correlation of the observed data provides an\nindication that, for the particular, configuration to which these\ndata apply, a definite relationship exists between the critical\npressure drop and the gas evolution potential. Although the latter\nterm cannot be quantitatively defined at this time, it is observed\nthat periodic, low frequency oscillations will be maintained. at\nlevels below a given critical steady-state injector pressure drop\nwhen the fuel has been condEtioned to a saturation point corresponding to 190 psi at a given temperature. These oscillations\nwill not be maintained in the identical hardware and operating\nconditions if the saturation conditions are decreased to a value\nlike 140 psi, which is lower than the interface pressure at the\nvalve inlet but, of course, higher than the nominal chamber pressure\nof 120 psi, In addition, it appears from the successive movie\nframes t h a t the fhel j e h impingement point and reaction zone\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\nluminosity are significantly affected by injection of helium.\nWith these observations in hand, one can speculate on the potential\ninteractions which can establish the feed back mechanism to\nsustain a periodic oscillatory phenomenon of more or less constant\nfrequency. This frequency, ranging somewhere in the vicinity of\n300 to 400 cps, can be approximated by the flight time periodicity\nof the fuel jets by dividing the jet velocity by twice the distance\nfrom the orifice entrance to the impingement point.\nThree possible feedback mechanisms have been hypothesized;\nall are based on the premise that the gas evolution influences\nthe specific operating variables indicated.\n1. The discharge coefficient for a fuel jet, having a\ngiven helium gas evolution potential, changes discontinuous1\na given value of instantaneous back pressure of AP (flipping\n\nat\n\n3.\n\n2. Triplet blow-apart, which changes the combustion rate\nand spatial location, occurs in a discrete manner as the instantaneous pressure drop or velocity of a fuel jet of given gas evolution potential varies.\n\n3. The reaction zone and the liquid volume of the fuel\norifices form a resonant system at given levels of gas evolution\npotentials. The latter quantity can be considered as a measure\nof fuel acoustic velocity. In this particular model, the higher\nAP would be considered strictly as increased resistance.\nIt might be helpful to elaborate briefly on some of the\nconsiderations which underlined these three models.\na.\n.\n\n-\n\nCa\n- Variation\n\nNO experimental data are available to us which\nwould confirm the hypothesis t1;2t "flipping" of a jet of high\ngas evolution potential occur? discretely at given levels of\npressure drop. To a large extent, this hypothesis evolved from\nthe observations on the photog~~aphs. It should be noted in\npassing. that Northup of G. E. ( ~ e f .\nFlow Stability of Small\nJets: paper - ASME November 1()58)! found that the "flipping"\ncharacteristics or an orifice \\ , m e significantly affected when\nit effluxed into a helium atmosphe3e compared to a nitrogen one.\n\nIt is well known from the work of other investigators\nthat blow-apart of reactive jets can occur when sufficient time\nexists for the production of vapors prior to impingement, Therefore, one cannot rule Out the possibility that liquid jets having\nsuch a high gas evolution potential as the ones which we are discussing could produce the same mechanism. It is not clear at\nthe moment how the change in jet velocity would modify this particular type of blow-apart.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nc,\n\nCombust-ion Feed System Interaction\n\nIt is, of course, possible that the combustion\ncan couple with a fuel fluid volume to establish the r5ght time\nrelationship to sustain a conti-nuous oscillation. In this case,\nthe gas evolution potential of the fuel would establish the\nacoustic velocity of the fluid and the pressure drop across the\norifice would be modeled as a value of resistance. We know, off\ncourse, that the complete feed system does not enter into this\ncoupling mechanism since more or less the same frequency is\nobtained in test cells having widely varying configurations;\nhowever, it is possible that a specific volume within the\ninjector, such as the injector orifices, could establish such a\ncoupling mechanism.\n\n-\n\nTask D\n\nThe Analysis of Applicable A.nal-ogue\nModels\n\nThe review and analysis of this model has indicated its\nability to provide correlation with test data in the following\nareas:\n1.\n\nSimulate the LFO frequency.\n\n2.\n\nCorrelate with fuel system variations and LFO\noccurrence.\n\n3.

Below a fuel\ninjection orifice pressure drop of 21 psi, the oscillations were\ncontinuous when helium saturation at maximum tank pressure was\nmaintained. At values between 21 psi to approximately 2 psi\n9\n(38 psi AP injector) the oscillations were discontinuous with\ndurations not exceeding 2 seconds. Above an injection orifice\npressure drop of 29 psi, few oscillations were noted and these\nwere attributed. to test procedures in which unusual amounts of\ngas could be trapped in the fuel line.\nAlthough the test data produced an operational limit, the\nmechanism producing the oscillations was not defined. Three\nmechanisms which might influence the oscillations were hypothesized.\nThese mechanisms were:\n1.\n\nResonant coupling between the feed system and the\ncombustion zone.\n\n2\n.\n\nBlow apart of the fuel/ox streams amplified by a\nchange in helium content.\n\n3. A change in\n\nC d at the orifice where a condition\nsimilar to "flip" may produce an oscillating mass/\nbreakup pattern.\n\nExamination of the Ball analogue model showed that a low\nfrequency oscillation could be produced when programmed discontinuities as inputs were arbitrarily added. The need to input\nthese discontinuities to prod~lcean oscillation describes a limitation of the model which should be updated. An examination of\nthe analogue model indicated that refinements could be made\nthat would spontaneously produce a oscillatory condition related\nto the LM development experience.\nThe conclusion that the combustion oscillations were related\nto fuel injection mechanism aqd that the exact mechanism of\nproducing the oscillations was unknown, led to the recommendations\nfor further evaluation of the program.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nThe analogue model should be modified to include\nthe limit of 21 psi pressure drop across the injection orifices.\nThis can be accomplished in the model by increasing the\n"combustion frequency" and modifying the "injector" to include a\ncoupling cond-itionwith the combustion zone. The injector\nmodification should be examined for inclusion of either the\ndigital injector model or the simulation of the injector by an\norifice and resonant cavity rather than the currently used orifice\nrepresentation.\nb.\n\nBlow Apart Experimental Examination\n\nThe mechanism of blow apart as related to helium\ncontent should be examined. It is proposed that single injection\nelement flow (photographic) tests be conducted where the helium\ncontent can be well controlled.\nCd\n- Evaluation Related to a\n\nlip"^ Condition\n\nThe influence of helium conteht on "flip" should\nbe examined and it is sugges7,;edthat it also be done by use\nof photography and injectors with fuel (single) elements. The\nstudy would be directed toward determining the extent, if any, .\nthat the fuel stream oscillated with a varying content of heliux.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nAPPENDIX I\n\nTASK A - DATA REVIEW AND CORRELATION\n\nBELL\n\nA.\n\nAEROSPACE C M A Y\nO PN\n\nANALYSIS OF START iiFOOTBALLSriI N TEST CELLS 3DE AND 2 W\nD\n1.\n\nT e s t C e l l 3DE ( ~ o r i z o n t a l\nSea L e v e l T e s t S t a n d )\n\nReview o f t h e t e s t i n g conducted d u r i n g t h e L s t a b i l i t y\nM\nprogram r e v e a l e d t h a t v a r i o u s c o n f i - g u r a t i o n s o f i n j e c t o r s were\nt e s t e d i n t h i s f a c i l i t y .

Review\nof these procedures ( ~ i g u r e s\n1-19 thru 1-22) indicate that various\namounts of He in solution could be achieved,depending on the\nprocedure used. I n some cases, the procedure could produce\nsupersaturated propellants at test conditions.\nIn order to determine if the type of saturation affected\nthe post start football on the LM injector, the\'data were reviewed\nto find a single injector that had been tested using the four\ntypes of saturation. It was determined that injector E2CA-113HF\nwas the only source of data. The data used for this comparison\nis tabulated in Table 8 and was confined to tests at 70\xc2\xb0F. For\nthe purpose of this analysis, fuel flowrate was plotted vs, football\namplitude. Figure 1-23 is a plot of all data available on this\nunit and shows that there is an effect with saturation type.\nFigure 1-24 shows the trends from Figure 1-23 without the data points.\nFrom this analysis the following hypotheses have been made\nabout the saturation types.\nsaturation Type IIA\nThis type saturates at pressure levels higher than run\nlevels, then vents the tank pressure to run conditions. This\napproach conceivably allows the gas to come out of solution and\nbe distributed throughout the entire feed system. This would\ncreate a supersaturated condition. As can be seen from Figure 1-18\nfootballs, were created on all tests using this type of saturation\nand there is no amplitude trend with flow changqs.\n2\n\nType 111\n\nThis type saturates the propellant at 140 psia. This\npressure is lower than any run pressures used in this test series.\nTherefore, the higher run pressure could create a condition that\nwould permit absorption of any gas that might come out of solution\ndue to pressure drops in the propellant feed system. Figure 1-24\nshows that no footballs were noted.\n\n3.\nare similar. This is due to\nthe fazt that there is no rapid venting prior to the engine testing,\nTherefore, the system can operate without L F O f s until. it reaches\nits own "~reakpoint", Figure \' 24 shows that Types I and IIB show\nsimilar trzends. It s h o u l d be\nred that the breakpoint is at a\nhigher flowrate for Type LIB t n it is for Type I, It could be\nhypothesized that this effect\ndue to more gas being available\nof\nwith Type IIB saturation becaucc-> the higher saturation levels,\n\nTest\nNo.\n\n112\n123\n12\n.0\n128\n13\n.1\n111\n110\n\n107\n\n121\n\nPXIA\n\nDur.

As can be seen from these\nfigures the variations in the test cell geometry are substantial.\nIn order to define the effects of line length and volume, plots\nwere made of these parameters vs critical pressure drop (F-1gure1-30).\nThis figure would indicate that the variation in critical pressure\ndrop is not a function of physical variations in volume or length.\nIn ~ r d e rto determine the effects of system pressure drop, plots\nwere made of the start transient fuel feed pressure decay and the\nsteady state pressure drop from tank to engine interface ( ~ i g u r e\n1-31). This figure would indicate that the start football breakpoint *is not a function of system pressure drop. Figure 1-32 shows\nplots of fuel overflow and fuel feed pressure recovery time during\nthe start transient. This figure would indicate a correlation\nwith both parameters when compared to injector critical pressure\ndrop. This data would indicate that the fuel velocity during\nthe start transient is an important parameter with respect to\nstart footballs. It is also interesting to note that in a fixed\nsystem the flow velocity increases as supply pressure increases,\nthis observation agrees with the reduction and elimination of start\nfootballs with increased chamber pressure.\nb)\n\nAnalysis of the Effect of Increased Saturation\nPressure on Start l~ootballs\n\nIn order to define if the pressure at which the\npropellant is saturated has an effect on the start football\nduration or the injector critical pressure drop the following\nanalysis was conducted,\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n1) Test Cell 2DW\nDuring the engine development testing in Cell\n2DW variations in propellant conditioning pressure were made.\n\nIrlitially, all propellant conditioning was conducted at 50 psi.\nThe start football analysis discussed in the first monthly\nprogress report utilized only tests during which the propellant\nconditioning was conducted at 50 psi. This data revealed that the\ncritical injector pressure drop for start footballs was 32.8 psi.\nIn an attempt to define the critical pressure drop for injectors\nwhen the propellants are saturated at 190 psi data from testing\nwith injectors E2C-113, ~ 2 ~ ~ - and 7\n1 4 E~CE-141 plotted against\nwas\nfuel flow rate. This data is plotted in Figure 1-33. Due to the\nlack of data at fuel flow rate above 4.8 pounds per second, the\ndata had to be extrapolated in order to predict the critical\ninjector pressure drop. This drop is projected to be 40 psi for\nsaturation pressure of 190 psi as compared to 32.8 psi for\nsaturation pressure of 50 psi. It is also interesting to note\nthat the football duration is significantly increased at saturation\npressures of 190 psi and contindes until the engine shutdown at\nreduced flow rates.\n2)\n\nTest Cell 1BN\n\nIn order to collaborate the results noted in\nCell 2DW, test results in cell 1BN were examined. As previously\ndiscussed in this report, the injector critical pressure drop\nhas been defined at 27.4 psi for saturation pressures of 50 psi.\nAdditional data has been examined from tests on injector E2CE-133\nwith saturation pressures of 1140 psi. This data is plotted in\nFigure 1-34 and again when conlpared to the 50 psi saturation data\nshows an increase in critical pressure drop; again the increased\nduration football is noted with increased saturation pressure.\n\nM A I N LINE: FEED SYSTEM\n\nFIG\n\n*\n\n.\n\n--\n\n1-26\n\n+\'\n\n.V\n\n3\n\ni\n\n2BE\n\n1-5 MAIN FUEL FEED\n\'I\nLINE (FROM SOURCE TANK\nTO BIPROP VAEVL;: INLET )\n\n/\nI\n\nFUEL TANK\n\n>\n\n1\n\nHIGH POINT\nBLEEDFILTER\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n1j71-3 PRODUCTION\nLINE\nBIPROP VALVE\nINLET FLANGE\n22" -\n\nHIGH POINT\n\n-\n\nFUEL ACTUATION$\nLINE ( 5 / B f f\n\na\n,0\n\ng\n\nk\n\n-\n\nI:\ni\n\nFIGURE 1-27\n\nr\n\n-\n\n3DE FUEL FEED SYSTEM\n\n231 1 1\n\nI\n\n(74\n\nBIPROPELLANT VALVE\nINLET FLANGE\n\nTANK TO TANK A N N I N\nTANK A N N I N TO FILTER\nFILTER TO W F - 1\n\n(4) WF -1\n\nTO WF-2\n\n(5)\n6)\n\nTO STAND A N N I N\n\n71\n\n2$" LINE\nlHtl\nLINE\nl F tLINE\nl\n1+" LINE\n\n1s" LINE\nSTAND A N N I N TO HI-Prll.

The objective of the test program was to determine the\noperating parameters required to eliminate footballs. Review of\nthis data has revealed the following information:.\n1.\n\nPost Start Footballs\n\nDuring this test program there were no post\'start or\nsustained footballs noted. Figure\' I-35 is a plot of fuel flowrate\nvs. post start football duration. From this figure we can see\nthat no post start footballs were ever noted even at fuel flowrates\nas low as 3.68 lb/sec of fuel (equivalent to injector AP=lg.g).\nHowever, it should be noted that the maximum pressure and temperature\nused to saturate the propellants was 80 psi and 100\xc2\xb0F. The He\nin solution at this pressure and temperature is still less than\nthe propellant is capable of absorbing at the feed pressure required\nfor the 3.68 lb/sec fire test (FFP = 143.8) and TO0F temperatures.\nThus, a dependency of saturation level or condition on critical\npressure drop is clearAy apparent.\n2.\n\nStart Footballs\n\nFollowing the first few fire tests, staxat footballs were\nnoted on all runs at nominal and low pressure. These footballs\nwere noted even with many changes to the test cell and engine\nhar,dware. These changes were as follows:\na.\n\nOrifices removed from feed system (20 psi at rated)\n\nb.\n\nOrifices removed from engine (16 psi at rated)\n\nc.\n\nLarge throated thrust chamber\n\nFigure 1-36 is a plot ;of fuel f\'lowrate vs. start football duration.\nThe data plotted shows that the above noted changes had no effect\non the football "breakpoint" or the duration. It is interesting\nto note that the injector pressure drop at the "breakpoint" fuel\nflow is equal to 29.9 psi which is approximately the same as noted\nin A (32.8). The lower breakpoirlt may be due to the reduced\nsaturation level.\n\nBELL AEROSPACE COMPANY\n\nDuring t h i s t e s t s e r i e s , s e v e r a l t e s t s were conducted\nw i t h He being i n j e c t e d i n t o t h e o x i d i z e r and f u e l feed systems.\nFor t h e t e s t s analyzed t h e He i n j e c t i o n p r e s s u r e was c o n s t a n t .\na.\n\n-e\nH\n\nI n j e c t i o n i n t o Fuel Feed Line\n\nFigure 1-37 i s a p l o t of f u e l feed p r e s s u r e vs. f o o t b a l l\nd u r a t i o n .

No effort was made to tailor a\nmodel which would produce this phenomena; but rather it was attempted\nto determine from the generalized model whether low frequency\noscillations are produced under specific operating conditions. It\nis found that the model in its present form indicates favorable trends\nand is in reasonable fundamental agreement with experimental data.\nIn pa,rticular, the "footballs" are noted; however, further effort and\nsome model improvement will be required to obtain better correlation\nwith experimental data, Sufficient correlation has been obtained to\nconfirm the basic concepts upon which the model is based. When\nfinal proposed improvements are incorporated, the simulation will be\nan effective tool,\nAnalog computer results for several conditions are presented,\nillustrating the "football" phenomena and the values of pressure, and\ntransport delay time required for their formation.\nFinally, a proposed program for model improvement is presented.\n\nB.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe occurrence of pressure oscillations in feed systems and\ncombustion chambers motiviated a theoretical study to devise a\nmathematical model which would sirnulate the observed behavior and\nwhich could subsequently be employed to obtain a better understanding\nof the phenomena,\nSince information obtained by experiment is usually in the time\ndornair~, it was felt that a rocket, engine simulation yielding time\nhistories directly would be desirable, Equations incorporating known\ncharacteristic properties have been derived and simulated on the\nanalog computer. This report describes the Bell Aerospace analog\nmodel and presents a proposed program for model improvement to obtain\nbetter prediction .of engine-feed system behavior, as well as for use\nin general engine design and devclopment,\nC.\n\nDTSCUSSION OF RATIONALE\n\nA rocket engine system is composed of several coupled subsystems.\nSince it is not known which particular subsystem is the prime contributor to the observed intermittent low frequency instability, one\nmust rely upon a simplified simulation of the entire system as a\nstartilig point, T h i s forms a framework for contimnous refinemen ; of\nthe subsysierns u n t i l the most sensitive ele~liellt is located, This\np i i i \' ? s o p h y C o ~ ~ o e the bas?;^ for the developrient of the ma?,liematical\nd\nmode I\n\n.\n\nBELL AER0SPAC;E COMPANY\n\nA r a t j o n a l e of t h e methods used i n t h e f u l f i l l m e n t of t h e\nrequirements i n t h e work s t a t e m e n t w i l l be p r e s e n t e d .

Reducing this volume in the simulation to one-half the\ng~omctricvolume yielded frequencies of approximately 400 Hz and\npropellant transit time of approximately 5 M.S. This frequency is\nIn l4easonableagreement with the observed frequency and the transit\ntimt is rather close to that expected. For example, assuming propellant exit velocities of 140 ft per second, the impact time is\nslightly less than 1 M.S. which allows approximately 4 M.S. for\ncomplete combustion to occur. Figure 111-2 shows that a "football"\nis not present with t = 5.3 M.S. Figures 111-3 - 111-5 show the\nIt\nfootball" magnitude progressively increases with increasing t\nwhere t = 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, respectively. For these runs the\nmixture ratio was higher than design value. For t = 7.6 M.S. a\npost start "football" is present with the steady-state mixture\n111-6). Notice that for\nratio of the design value of 1.6 ( ~ i g u r e\nthe lower mixture ratio condition, the instability present in the\nPC rise has been eliminated.\nFeed line oscillations during injection fill are\nsomewhat larger than those show11 in test data. This is attributed\nto the lack of information on t,he magnitude of the damping constant\nwhich must be inserted in line dynamics loop as given in Attachment 111-R.\nA mathkmatical raationale of the "football" phenomena\nis presented in Attachment 111-8.\nTransient Volumetric Effects\nAs previously stated, the 400 Hz frequency could be\nproduced by using an "effective" volume smaller than the actual\nchamber. This could imply that the frequency is a function of the\nactual "reaction" colume rather than the geometrical one. When the\npropellant enters the chamber initially combustion should occur\nthrough the entire volume and this volume becomes the 11 effect,vet\'\nv o l u ~ e . As PC increases, the "effective" volume tends to decrease\nto i-ts steady-state value. If this hypothesis is true, then one\nshould expect a decrease in observed frequency during the PC transient. Observation of test data reveals this to be true. However,\nfor the analog model, the volu~vc?is assumed constant through the\ntransient as well as the steady-state, When this effect is\nincorporated in the analog model, one may expect decreased aniplitudc\nand frequency during the PC rise and better agreement with experirneni,dl d a t a ,\n\nFigure JiV-4\n\nBELL ARIIOSI\'ACF COMPANY\n\nTile existing Rcll pressure fed rocket engine model is used to\ncalculate the transient and steady-state performance of various\nroc!;et engine systems, It does this by breaking the propellant feed\nsystem into a number of segments or modules dictated by the particular\ndesign corifiguration, and calculating the flow and pressure in them.\nSubsequently, the feed system from tank to injector or valve is\nsinulated by a cascade of individual modules. The valve simulation\na,ssur?les valve opening is linear, while the injector is simulated by\na pressure drop only. The transportation delay is determined by a\ntime delay device which simulates the propellant flight time (between\ninjector face and impingement point plus vaporization and burning\ntime). The combustion process is a function of precomputed thermochemical data.\nA detail digital model of the injector is available. Acoustic\nvelocity and pressure drops at all major flow passages may be given\nany design values, and subsequently, impedance and frequellcy\ncharacter5 sties may be determined.\nI\n\nThe present analog model Lndicates trends which are, in general.,\nconsistent with test results, Specific detailed correlation has not\nbeen attempted in Phase l of this effort, only a comparison of\navailable preliminary analog results with test C-ata was made. These\ncomparisons indicate that the basic concepts set forth in the model\nare valid and that more detailed simulation, based upon tile present\nmodel, is desirable.\nBased upon studies made in Phase 1, the following recommendations\nare made.\nTask A\nActivate present analog model and obtain agreement with present\nexperimental data point (condition for "football" as determined from\npresent experimental data).

However, if a disturbance occurs in the fuel line T\' is\naltered and subsequently the magnitude and decay rate are\naffected resulting in a more drastic change in re, or a dynamic\nsituation is initiated.
