The\nyears between then and now\nhave added immeasurably to\nour store of aeronautical\nknowledge. The refinements\nof theory and the gathering of\npractical data by engineers\nand scientists have increased\nour understanding of why\nflight is possible.

In the controlled environment of today\xe2\x80\x99s wind tunnels, turbulence affects test results to a\ndegree still to be exactly determined. Turbulence is an\nimportant component of\nflight mechanics, and a very\ncomplex one. It is so complex, in fact, that it cannot\neven be analyzed totally by\nthe fastest and most capable\ncontemporary computers.\n\nBut it can be approximated,\nand quite closely, in some\ncases. So can some of the lesser mysteries of flight: Those\nthat cause an airplane to turn\nand climb and dive; those that\nmake it possible to build a\nlight and simple structure that\ncan withstand the winds of\nsuper-hurricane force hurtling across a wing; those that\nextend the range of an airplane\nso that it can cross oceans.\n\nAeronautical research,\nthen, is often a science of approximations. It attempts to\nunderstand the \xe2\x80\x9cwhy,\xe2\x80\x9d not\njust the \xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x9d of flight. It\ndoes this, because understanding how a thing works is\nthe main path toward making\nit work better. So aeronautical\nresearch also becomes the\nscience of the approximations\nof improvement .\n\n2\n\nT h e National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration\nwas chartered officially to\nconduct aeronautical research, among its other defined tasks. That was the only\ntask for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor,\nthe National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,\nfounded in 1915. The National Aeronautics and Space\nAct of 1958, the legislation\nthat established NASA, states\nthat the general welfare and\nsecurity of the United States\nrequire adequate provision to\nbe made for aeronautical activities, and that these activities should be so conducted as to contribute materially to one or more of these\nobjectives:\n0 The expansion of knowledge of phenomena in the\natmosphere.\n\nThe improvement of the\nusefulness, performance,\nspeed, safety, and efficiency\nof aeronautical vehicles.\n0 The preservation of the\nrole of the United States as a\nleader in aeronautical science\nand technology.\n\nA joint NASA-Nauy program\nuses this Gwmman F-14A\nfighter as a flight research uehicle to investigate a new control\nsystem concept originating at the\nLangley Research Center. The\nvew system features an aileron-rudder interconnect (AH)\nfor improved handling qualities\nat high angles of attack. This\nF-14A has been modified to include a spin-recwery parachute\nand two-position deployable\ncanard sudaces. The canards,\nshown extendedfrom the fuselage sides just forward of the\npilot\xe2\x80\x99s position, are part of the\nspin-recweiy system on this research aircraft.\n\nThe most effective utilization of the scientific and engineering resources of the\nUnited States in order to\navoid unnecessary duplication of effort, facilities and\nequipment.\nNASA research scientists,\npart of a team that includes\nindustry, universities, other\ngovernment organizations,\nand laboratories, both private\nand government, work toward those broad objectives.\nSpecifically, NASA aims its\nresearch toward the advancement of both civil and\nmilitary aeronautics, pointing\ntoward new concepts of\nflight, seeking new approaches to solve the everchanging, ever-complex\nproblems of transportation,\nand evolving new ideas to\nstimulate the designers of\ntomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s aircraft and\naeronautical vehicles.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s broad field of\naeronautical research has as\nits primary subjects the vehicles and powerplants that use\nthe Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere for\nflight. It also is concerned\nwith the aeronautical aspects\n\nof space vehicles that depart\nfrom, or land on, the Earth.\nThe major share of this\nwork is done at four NASA\ncenters: Langley Research\nCenter, Hampton, Virginia;\nAmes Research Center,\nMoffett Field, California;\nDryden Flight Research\nCenter, Edwards, California;\nand the Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio.\nAdditional studies are done\nat other NASA labs, or at the\nlaboratories and facilities of\nother government agencies.\nPrivate industry makes major\ncontributions, from selfsupported research and development programs, and\n\nfrom NASA-funded programs. Universities have a\nunique contribution to make\nthat reflects-their long tradition of academically oriented\nresearch studies. The military\nservices become partners\nwith NASA on specific programs or projects, or longterm participants in one or\nmore fields of investigation.\nNASA research is planned\nto support the needs of\noperating agencies, such as\nthe Department of Defense\nand the Department of\nTransportation, and of the\naerospace industry, with its\nmyriad of ideas for future designs and development.\n\nTo solve the problem of engine\ninlet airflow separation, h i s\nResearch Center and Grumman\nAircraft Corporation conducted\na joint test project using this\ntypical nacelle installation\nwhich houses the engine of a\nVISTOLpowerplant. A n annular jet of air was blown over\nthe internalsudace of the engine\ninlet to delay the separation of\nairflow from that region. The\nuseful nacelle angle-ofattack\nrange was essentially doubled by\nusing the blown jet. This first\nsuccessful demonstration of the\nprinciple could lead to substantially lighter and more compact\ninlet designs for VISTOL\naircraft.\n\n3\n\nFour Ways\nto\nResearch\n\nDriven\nby Air\nMovements\n\nAn advanced turbofan engine\nthat powers US.

In a\ndynamic world that is becoming more international by\nthe day, and where developing countries are spawning\nmajor industrial complexes\nthat generate passenger and\nfreight traffic, air transportation is probably the single\n\nswung up and open for access to\nthe engine. Almost all of the extemalvisible mass ofpiping and\ncabling is test instrumentation,\ninstalled onIy for the research\nprogram in the Lewis facility.\nFor a typical test program, both\n\nmost important supporting\nservice.\nToday, tourists and business travelers are flying across\nseas and continents for vacations or commerce. Expanding industries reach out to\nnew sources of raw materials\nor labor, generating a new\ntraffic pattern for the flow of\ngoods. Oil, the common denominator of movement, has\nalone remodeled the air travel\npatterns of the globe.\nProjections for the future\n\n4\n\nthe engine and the altitude inside the test chamber are controlled to verifr engine performance ouer a wide range of\nambient conditions of speed and\naltitude.\n\nof air transportation almost\nstagger the imagination. A\nmajor problem is how to handle the demands for growth,\nparticularly in a world of apparently decreasing oil\nsupplies and escalatingprices.\nMore efficient aircraft designs are needed, and that requirement demands new\nkinds of powerplants, new\napproaches to lightweight and\nefficient structures, and new\nways to increase range by decreasing drag. More aircraft\nmovements carry the potential for increased neighborhood noise near major airports around the world, and\nalready have crowded the\ntraffic lanes of the air to the\npoint of near-saturation.\nNASA looks aheadjworking\non problems that will obviously require solutions before\nthe next ten years have passed.\nBut a large portion of NASA\nwork also is directed to the\nimmediate problems of\ntoday, whether they be some\naerodynamic quirks of a\nfighter just entering operation,\nor the strains on a production\nengine being boosted to new\nlimits of performance.\n\nNASA aeronautical research\nis categorized in aquartet of\nheadings: Proof of concept, extension of the art, future needs,\nand problem solving.\nProof of concept is an approach\nthat often, but not always, requires the building and testing of a special aeronautical\nvehicle. The best-known\nexamples are the famed Xseries of research aircraft developed by NACA and industry in the late 1940s and\nsubsequently. A more recent\nexample is the joint NavyArmy-NASA-Bell XV- 15, a\nunique rotorcraft with a potential for both military and\ncivil use. Technology is available for proof of concept, but\nneeds to be transformed into\na tangible flying machine for\nthe ultimate test.\nExtension of the art takes as a\nbasis the contemporary state\nof that art, and builds on that\nfoundation. Today\'s subsonic\ntransport aircraft are, for\nexample, well understood.\nBut continuing research in\naerodynamics, propulsion,\nstructures, materials and avionics indicates that tomor-\n\n-.\n\n.\n\nhorizontalplane us shown here.\nThe XV-15(its militaty designation) can I$t OfluerticaIIy\nand then, by a progressiue forward tilting of the rotor assemblies, can translate the uertical lifting force into forward\nthrust. This project is a joint\nprogram shared by the Army\nand NASA. The basic purpose\nis to conduct a thorough inuestigation and evaluation of the\ntilt-rotor system for advanced\nvertical and short takeofland\nbnding aircraft.\n\n.. . .\n.\n\nI\n\nrow\xe2\x80\x99s transports could be improved by the incorporation\nof new ideas. The art has been\nextended, and that body of\nknowledge is available to industry as foundation stones\nfor the next-built generation\nof aircraft.\nFuture needs call for the\nbroadest research goals,\nsometimes the end point of\nwork that would seem to have\nlittle practical current application. An example: The investigation of highly specialized and very expensive materials for use in some future\npowerplant. At today\xe2\x80\x99s prices,\nthe cost of using the materials\nwould be prohibitive; but\nhistorically, the costs of new\nmaterials decrease as the\nnumber of applications increases. And there never will\nbe any future applications\nunless research is done now\nto lead toward them.\n\nfor some years, in the case of\ncivil aircraft-may develop a\nproblem that could not have\nbeen predicted earlier, a\nproblem related perhaps to\nlong-time exposure to some\nexternal force. That kind of\nproblem-solving is typical of\nthe work that NASA has\nProblem solving is obvious redone.\nsearch. The best of designs,\nThese four categories\nafter painstaking analysis,\nfurther subdivide themselves\nextensive wind-tunnel testing into two broad areas. The first\nand exploration of the flight\nis disciplinary research, dealenvelope-perhaps even after ing with a branch of the\ncertification and operation\naeronautical art.\n\nAerodynamics, propulsion,\nstructures and materials are\ntypical areas where disciplinary research is conducted.\nThe second is research\napplied to specific classes of\naircraft, for example, subsonic transports or fighters.\nIn either of these classes of\nresearch, flight vehicles may\nbe used to prove a concept,\ntest a refinement, or to carry\nsome particular research experiment into an environment not so efficiently\nreached on the ground.\n\nThesecondof the two Tilt-Rotor\nResearch Aircrafi (TRRA),\nbuilt by Bell Helicopterfor a\njoint NASA-Army program, is\nshown in horizontal flight.\nFixed wing surfaces cawy the\nrotor assemblies and power\nplant\nnacelles, and generate liJt for\nhorizontalflight.\n\n5\n\nThe Tools\nof\nResearch\n\nT h e general popular impression of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s aeronautical\nresearch visualizes a huge\nwind-tunnel section containing a full-sized airplane\nmounted on struts, dwarfing\nthe researcher standing near\nto give scale. Wind tunnels\nwere, and are, a most important component of NASA\nfacilities, and a very longstanding method of tonducting research experiments.\nThey provide a means to\ntest accurate scale models, or\neven full-size actual aircraft,\nover some of the normal\nspeed range encountered in\nflight. These are carefully\ncontrolled tests, with a calibrated airstream rushing past\nthe mounted model. Accurate balances measure the\nforces, and computers translate those measurements of\npounds of tension and compression into coefficients of\nlift, drag and pitching moments.\nBut before wind-tunnel\ntesting occurs, analytical\nmethods traditionally are\nused to predict the behavior\nof an aircraft in flight. Once\nlaboriously done with pencil,\n\nA dynamically similar scaled\nmodel of the Grumman P-14A\nfighter aircraft isshown during\na test program in the Langley\nResearch Centerfull-scale tun-\n\nslide rule and perhaps a desk\ncalculator, such analyses now\nare the special provinces of\nhigh-speed computers. They\nprocess codes fashioned to\nforecast flow patterns and\nforces around a fuselage or\nwing, or their juncture.\nThe simulator offers a third\napproach to research. Driven\nby many computational circuits that calculate the behavior of an aircraft and present it in a display, the\nsimulator offers a way of\n\xe2\x80\x9cflying\xe2\x80\x9d an aircraft before it is\nbuilt. The characteristics of\nthe vehicle, determined from\ndrawings, analysis and model\ntests, are programmed into\nthe computer. Played back to\n\n6\n\nnel. The tethered model can be\nflown from pilot stations in the\ntunnel to simulate behavior at\nthe low-speed end of the F-14A\xe2\x80\x99s\nflight envelope. Studies of the\n\nengineers or pilots \xe2\x80\x9cflying\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe new design, they reveal\nthe good and bad qualities.\nA simulator can be used to\nduplicate an existing aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s\nflying qualities,,and to present them in a realm that might\nendanger a crew on a real\nflight. It can refine an airplane\ndesign before final production drawings are released to\nthe shops. It can study the\neffects of minor or major\nchanges in the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s components, powerplants, or\nother systems.\nAnalysis, model testing and\nsimulation all contribute to\nthe understanding of the\nperformance of a flight vehicle. One step remains: Flight\n\nof the vehicle itself. NASA\nresearch pilots, who also are\nengineers, conduct a meticulous program that gradually\nprobes the flight envelope,\nedging toward the speed, altitude and load limit that will\ndefine the final performance\nof the aircraft itself. This fullscale research furnishes answers that will corroborate,\nextend and perhaps correct\nthe inputs from analysis,\nwind-tunnel tests, and\nsimulation.\nThese are the four major\ntools of NASA researchers.\nThey have been used singly,\nor in concert, to explore problem areas in the safety, efficiency, or comfort of aircraft.\n\nv---\n\nEnergy-Efficient\n.\nAircraft?\'\n- * .\n\n-\n\nEfficiency (ACEE)program is\na ten-year planned effort that\nlooks simultaneously at\nnear-term and far-term\nproblems. It attempts to develop solutions that can be\napplied to existing transports,\nto their derivatives expected\nwithin a few years, and to new\nclasses of aircraft designed specifically to be, fuel-efficient.\nThe broad goal of the\nACEE program is the de-\n\nCommercial transports burn\nabout ten billion gallons of\naviation fuel each year. A five\npercent improvement in their\noverall efficiency would save\nthe United States 500 million\ngallons of fuel annually. And\nfive percent is well within the\npotential for improvements\nin aerodynamics, propulsion,\nand other active systems of\ncommercial transports.\nNASA\'s Aircraft Energy\n\nairplane\'s stability and control\nat high angles of attack, such as\ndemonstrated here, may lead to\nsuggeitions for improvements in\npegorance, or handling, or both.\n\nn\n\nD\n\nL"\n1\n\nh\n\nThe exceptional aerodynamic\ncleanliness of this prototype\ngeneral aviation aircraft red t e d in outstanding high;peedperformance, achieved apjarently by attaining a high\ndegree of natural laminar flow.\nNASA evaluated the aircraft in\na flight-test program at\nLangley, to determine its drag\ncharacteristics and to ascertain\nthe extent o the laminarflow\nf\ncharacteristics. Results are applicable not onIy t o the design of\nfuture light, general-aviation\n\nSpinning characteristics of a\ntypical light single-engined\naircraft were studied i n a progressive program at the Langley\nResearch Center. The test series\nbegan by observing the behavior\nof small dynamically similar\nmodels in the Langley spin tunnel. Later, radio-controlled\nmodels were flown in smallscale, free-flight testsfor comparison with spin-tunnel results. Then the full-scale aircraft began its flight research\nprogram to investigate the basic\n\nqualities and quantities of the\nspin, and to relate them to the\nresults obtainedfrom model tests.\nASpart of the aircraft research\nprogram, a number of different\nvertical and horizontal tail\nconfigurations were evaluated\nfor their effect on aircrafi spin\ncharacteristics.Modificationst o\nthe standard airplane also included wingtip booms for instrumentation and a spinrecovery chute mounted on an\nexternal bracket below and behind the base of the rudder.\n\nFour of the empennage geometries evaluated on NASA 501,\nthe spin-research aircraft typical of light single-engined\nplanes, demonstrate different\n\n-\n\n,C.\n\nTail 2\n\ne--*\n-\n\n--+WE=\n\n.\n\nvelopment of an inventory of\ntechnology, available to the\nmanufacturers of transports\nand powerplants in the\nUnited States. Most of the research and technology projects grouped under this program are being done by industry, the constructors of\nairframes and engines. Their\nexisting facilities and test aircraft can do the work efficiently. Additional efforts are\nbeing made by the commercial airlines, who furnish their\nspecial inputs to the seekers\nof operational solutions.\nACEE is a continuation of\nan earlier program that\nNASA had instituted before\nthere was a fuel crisis. During\nthe early 1970s, the agency\nbegan studies of Advanced\nTransport Technology\n(A"),\nwith the goal of examining new concepts and\ntheir effect on productivity.\nMany of the ideas that originated then-supercritical\naerodynamics, composite\nstructural materials, and activecontrol systems-became\nfoundation stones for current\nACEE work, because they\nalso reduce fuel consumption.\n\nThe Energy-Efficient\nTransport (EET) studies, one\nof six technology programs\nthat comprise the overall\nACEE work, serve to illustrate the interdisciplinary approach to new solutions.\nCommercial airlines are concerned with three operational\nfactors: The direct operating\ncost (DOC), the range, and\nthe weight of the aircraft.\nMore than half of the current\nDOC is charged to fuel; obviously, any reduction in fuel\nconsumption would mean a\nmajor improvement in DOC.\nReductions in drag, and other\nattainable improvements in\nthe ratio of lift to drag, will\nimprove the range capabilities. New materials and\nstructural concepts, combined with the use of active\ncontrols, can produce lighter\nand smaller airframes.\nThe NASA supercritical\nwing design and its subsequent development is one\nmethod for improving the\nlift-drag ratio. This unusual\nairfoil section controls the\nflow over the wing; it avoids\nthe sudden increase in drag\nthat would occur with con-\n\naerodynamic approaches t o the\nproblem of spin recovery. Tail 3\nfeatures a small endplate on top\nof the rudder. Tail 4 has a\nlow-set horizontal surface, but\nTail6 has the horizontal tailset\nhigher, on the lower portion of\nthe verticalfin.\nN A S A 501, the spin research\naircrafi typical of light single-engined designs, is shown in\nflight above the test area adjacent to the Wallops Plight Center, Wallops Island, Virginia.\nNumber 2 on vertical tail indicates that the plane is flying\nwith the second of several empennage configurations developed for improved spin recovery. Note the instrumentation\nbooms extendingforward from\neach wingtip, and the spinrecovery parachute mounted on\nthe aft fuselage behind and\nbelow the horizontal tail.\nthickness of the wing section.\nConsequently, a properly designed supercritical wing has\nthree direct benefits that improve aircraft efficiency:\nFirst, it reduces wing drag;\nsecond, it increases internal\nvolume for fuel storage; third,\nit increases the structural efficiency of the wing and leads\nto lower weight.\nThe total benefit of a welldesigned supercritical wing\ncould be a reduction of 10 to\n15 percent in the amount of\nfuel burned for a specified\ntrip.\nOther aerodynamic improvements with fuel-saving\npotential include winglets,\nsmall surfaces mounted at and\nabove the wingtips; high-lift\ndevices used during climb and\ndescent; active controls, to\nreduce the sizeand therefore the drag and\nweight-of horizontal and\nvertical tail surfaces; and\ncareful integration of the\npropulsion system into the\naerodynamic flow contours of\nthe aircraft.\nOne method with great\npotential for drag reduction is\nlaminar flow control (LFC),\n\nI\nTail 3\n\nTail6\n\nventional airfoils operating in\nhigh-speed airflow. Further,\nit shows this lower drag feature in spite of an increased\n\nShorter\nTakeoffs,\nLower Noise\n\nusing suction through multiple slots in the wing surface to\nmaintain smooth, low-drag\nairflow over the wing.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s interdisciplinary approach focuses on a lightweight, strong and rigid\nstructure combined with a\nsuction system that could\nmake practical LFC systems a\nreality.\nImprovements in propulsion include the development\nof engine componentscompressors, combustors,\nturbine-that\nhave higher\nindividual efficiencies. Beyond that work, there is potential for development of a\nbasically new powerplant\naround the older concept of a\nturboprop. That type of engine was once a way station on\nthe journey from piston engines driving propellers to jet\nengines. But now, the fuel efficiency of such an engine,\ncoupled with developments\nin propeller technology, have\nspurred a new look at this old\nidea.\nThe big difference is in the\nappearance of the propeller.\nInstead of the three Or four\nblades commonly seen on\n\nT h e broad aims of the ACEE\npropellers used with piston\nprogram apply best to longengines, the new propeller\nrange transports that carry a\nhas multiple blades, curved\nand shaped for maximum ef- hundred or more passengers\nacross continents and oceans.\nficiency at high rotational\nspeeds.

Tied closely to it has\nbeen the investigation of\nnoise, because one use of\nSTOLand vertical takeoff and\nlanding (VTOL) aircraft is\nplanned around the concept\nof close-in airports. Such locations demand aircraft with a\nlow noise level. This is not to\nimply that noise reduction is\nnot necessary at major terminals; it is.\nSeveral factors have altered\nthe noise environment\naround airports since jets first\nappeared on the scene in the\nlate 1950s. There has been a\ntremendous construction\nboom, and undeveloped land\neverywhere was used for suburban homes. Much of the\nundeveloped land around\nmajor cities was also around\nthe major airports that served\nthose cities. Consequently,\nhouses were built right up to\nthe borders of the field, in\nsome cases. There was also a\nrapid expansion of travel,\nwhich meant more flights and\ntherefore more airplanes to\ngenerate more noise around\nthe airport. Finally, the firstgeneration turbojet engines\n\n9\n\nThe Quiet Short-haul Research\nAircraft (QSRA) is a proofiofi\nconcept vehicle to investigate the\ntechnology of a Propulsive lift\nsystem that uses wing uppersurface blowing. I t utilizes a de\n\nin the transports gave way to\nlater and more efficient turbofan engines; but these later\npowerplants had a different\nnoise pattern which changed\nthe perceived sound levels.\nThese factors, although they\ndid not initiate NASA programs in noise research, certainly were additional spurs to\naccomplishment.\nNASA has developed\nmethods for lowering the\nnoise level of large jet transports by an acoustic treatment\nof the engine nacelles. The\n\xe2\x80\x9cquiet\xe2\x80\x9d nacelle found wide\nacceptance among airline operators. But that was, obviously, an interim solution.\nThe better way was to develop a \xe2\x80\x9cquiet\xe2\x80\x9d engine, and\nNASA-in a joint program\n\nHavilland C-8A \xe2\x80\x9cBuffalo\xe2\x80\x9d\nlight military transport loaned\nby the A m y for the program,\nand modified by The Boeing\nCompany t o incorporate the\npropulsive lift system in an en-\n\ntirely new wing design.Here the\nQSRA is being checked out by\nBoeing company pilots before\ndelivery to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames Research Center for the major portion of its research flying.\n\nwith industry-developed\nsuch an experimental powerplant that produced a significant reduction in generated noise.\nThat work also led to\nanother developmental powerplant designated QCSEE,\nfor Quiet, Clean, Short-haul\nExperimental Engine. It\nbegan test runs at the Lewis\nResearch Center in the late\n1970s. The goal of the program was to produce a powerplant for a four-engined,\n150-passenger STOL transport with a small and relatively low noise footprint.\nThe STOL technology\naround which the QCSEE was\ndeveloped utilized the engine\nexhaust to produce incremental lift. In one case, the\n\nexhaust was blown directly\nover external flaps to produce\nthe added lift for STOL. In\nthe other, part of the bypass\nair was ducted to blow over\nthe upper surface of the wing\nto generate additional lift.\nBoth these types of engines\nwere built and successfully\ntested.\nA parallel step was the development of the QSRA\n(Quiet Short-haul Research\nAircraft), which originated as\na proof-of-concept vehicle\nand a research tool. It was intended to validate the\ntechnology of apropulsive lift\nsystem that used upper-surface blowing. Additionally, its\noperations would develop\ncriteria for certification of\nfuture transports that used\n\npropulsive lift. The geometry\nof the QSRA is typical of a\nshort-haul transport, and the\nlow-speed flight regime is the\narea of particular interest.\nNoise levels, flying qualities,\nstability and control, and operational constraints are items\non the QSRA test program.\nThe wing of the QSRA,\nwhich incorporates the propulsive lift system, was designed and built by The Boeing Company, and installed as\na modification to a de Havilland of Canada C-8A \xe2\x80\x9cBuffalo,\xe2\x80\x9daU.S. Army light STOL\ntransport.

Capable\nof both STOL and VTOL\nperformance, and uniquely\nable to hover and perform\nother unusual aerial maneuvers, these aircraft pose problems that have intrigued researchers at NASA and elsewhere for decades. The\nproblems stem from the nature of their lift generation.\nTheir \xe2\x80\x9cwings\xe2\x80\x9d are rotating\nblades, whirled at high speeds\nin a horizontal plane, and adjusted individually by a complex mechanism in order to\nproduce motion about\nthree axes.\nTwo different flight vehicles are the keystones of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s rotary-wing research\nprograms. First of these is the\nTilt-Rotor Research Aircraft\n(TRRA), built by Bell\nHelicopter Textron under a\njoint effort that originally was\nshared by the Ames Research\nCenter and the Army\xe2\x80\x99s Air\nMobility Research and Development Laboratory. The\nTRRA, or XV-15(its military\ndesignation), has twin rotors\nand powerplants mounted at\nthe ends of a high wing. The\n\nI\n\nThe ArmyINASA Rotor Systems\nResearch Aircraft (RSRA),developed by Sikorsky Aircraft, is\nshown in level flight near the\nAmes Research Center. Two of\nthese unusual craft were built\nfor the joint program, one with\n\nthe ability t o be flown as a compound helicopter with fixed\nwings and aforwardpropulsion\nsystem as add-on features. The\nsecond, shown here, was designed tofly as apure helicopter\nt o furnish baseline test data,\n\nand to investigate rotor systems\nand other helicopter features on\nits own. One notable identification feature of the RSRA\nhelicopters is the tall vertical\nT-tail that carries the antitorque rotor.\n\n11\n\nOne of two Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) developedfor a joint NASA-Army\nprogram by Sikorsky Aircraft,\nthis particular RSRA is shown\nin its compound helicopterform.\nThefixed wings carry some of\nthe lift in horizontalflight, and\n\nr\n\nhelp to unload the rotor system.\nA standard Sikorsky S-61 rotor\nhead is used in the design. The\nturbofanengines mountedon the\nfuselageflanks are for forward\npropulsion; the lifting rotor is\ndriven by twin turboshaft engines mounted above the fuse-\n\n7 7\n\nlage. A unique crew escape system was developed for this research aircraft, which ejects the\nthree-man crew in split-second\nf\nsequencing following ejection o\nthe rotor blades.\n\nr\n\nIl\nr\n\nI___\n\nrotors can be tilted from horizontal, permitting vertical\nflight, to vertical, permitting\nhorizontal flight.\nTwo XV-15 aircraft were\nbuilt. The first, after a few\nhours of check flights, was\nmounted in the Ames fullscale tunnel and tested\nexhaustively. The second,\nwhich first flew in the hover\nmode in early 1979,became\nthe primary flight-research\nsubject. Both aircraft now are\nbeing flown in a detailed re-\n\nsearch program which is continuing.\nThe second type is the\nRotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA), built by\nSikorsky Aircraft Division of\nUnited Technologies Corp.\nfor NASA and the Army. The\ntwo aircraft built under the\nprogram use Sikorsky S-61\nhelicopter rotor heads as the\nbasic lifting system, but are\ndesigned to be able to test a\nwide variety of rotor systems.\nThe RSRA can be flown as a\n\n12\n\nconventional helicopter, or as\na compound helicopter, with\nfixed wings installed to \xe2\x80\x9cunload\xe2\x80\x9d the rotor by assuming\nsome of the lift.\nThe RSRA brings new\nflexibility and versatility to\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s rotary-wing flight\nresearch program. It operates\nover a wide speed range, so\nthat the likely flight envelope\nof any near-future helicopter\ndesign could be explored extensively. Both aircraft have\nbeen delivered and are flying\n\nat the Ames Research Center.\nThe RSRA and the XV-15\nalso can perform additional\nflight research, once their\nbasic programs have been\ncompleted. The RSRA aircraft will be used for studying\nnoise, the dynamics of rotorcraft, and rotor modifications.\nBoth aircraft will be used in\nthe development of avionics\nsystems for improved\nhelicopter operations in both\nclear and bad weather.\n\nReal-World\nEnvironments\n\ncc?\nA\n\nOperational and safety problems have been traditional\ntopics for NASA aeronautical\nresearch. Flight in bad\nweather, landings on wet\nrunways, and airport approaches during periods of\nhigh-density traffic flow have\nbeen studied and improved\nby NASA programs.\nOne of the most productive\nof these is the continuing\nwork on the Terminal-Configured Vehicle (TCV), a research airplane with unique\ncapabilities. The TCV was\nmodified from a standard\nBoeing 737 twin-engined jet\ntransport by adding a second\ncockpit, with advanced digital\navionics systems, in the\npassenger cabin of the 737.\nTwo sets of crews may fly the\nTCV; up front, in the usual\npositions, is the safety crew.\nBack in the second cockpit\nare the pilots who fly the TCV\nin its research toward improving terminal area capacity and efficiency, and toward\nimproving approach and\nlanding capabilities in bad\nweather conditions.\nIn the late 1970s, delays\ncost the airlines about a half-\n\nNASA Terminal-Configured\nVehicle (TCV) is shown in this\ncutaway model of the modified\nBoeing 737 aircraft. The test\nprogram is flown from the re-\n\nsearch cockpit, located in the\nforward fuselage of the TCV.\nSafetypilots in the conventional\ncockpit sewe as backup to the research pilots, and can f l y the\nairplane as required.

Concerned organizations such as\nNASA, the Federal Aviation\nAdministration, the Air Line\nPilots Association, and industry, have been studying\nways to increase the handling\ncapacity and capability of the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s high-density air terminal areas. They believe\nsuch increases are excellent\nways to increase the productivity of the air traffic control system and the airports.\nOne suggested partial solution is the use of a timecontrolled descent to the airport. FAA air traffic controlairlers at three major U.S.\nports have been working with\nthat method to simplify the\ncontrol of traffic in the approach. A computer sorts out\nand sequences arriving aircraft in a time-based traffic\ncontrol system, matching the\n\nairport demand to its capacity. Adding a \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d airplane\nwith advanced avionics systems permits the controller to\nprogress from active metering of traffic to passive metering. The TCV program is\ninvestigating the techniques\nneeded to achieve the\nassigned-time objectives accurately and effectively.\nResearch with the TCV aircraft has shown a consistent\nability to place the airplane at\na point in space-for example, at the start of the descent\nto the airport-within a few\nseconds. If there are unfavorable winds, that time may be\nincreased to as much as ten\nseconds. But that compares\nwith perhaps two minutes\xe2\x80\x99 accuracy with current conventional methods of air traffic\ncontrol.\nThe descent itself, handled\n\nby the \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d avionics in the\nTCV, is done along a flight\npath that uses minimum fuel,\nso that there is apotential fuel\nsaving by using the systems\nand techniques developed by\nthe TCV programs. Other\npotential payoff areas include\nroutine operations in bad\nweather, pilot participation in\nthe traffic control system loop\nby using a cockpit display of\ntraffic, reduced lateral separation and spacing, and reduced runway occupancy\ntime. All of these factors tend\nto increase the capacity of an\nairport in both clear and bad\nweather.\nBad weather can affect aircraft far from their terminal\nareas. Boiling up off the midwestern plains in the heat of\nsummer, violent thunderstorms could wrack an aircraft and do serious damage\n\nThe internalawangement of the\n\n13\n\nSmall wing-rootextensions have\nbeen added to a typical agriculturalaircrafc understudy in the\nfull-scalewind tunnel at\nLangley Research Center.\nNASA has been investigating\nthe characteristics and operations of agriculturalaircraftfor\nmany years, and has ongoing\nprograms to improue the performance capabilities,handling\nqualities, and safety of these\nspecialized airplanes and\nhelicopters. The subject of this\nspecific study was the airflow\npattern in the region of the\nwing-fuselageintersection.\n\n6\nto its structure and systems.\nBecause thunderstorms are\navoided, rather than sought\nout, there is little detailed,\ndata on their characteristics.\nTheir bad qualities are\nknown: Extreme turbulence,\nlightning strikes, torrential\nrains and pounding hail\nstorms. But quantifying those\ncharacteristics has not been\ndone adequately. NASA hasa\nresearch program, using test\nflights of a lightning-hardened General Dynamics FlO6B interceptor aircraft, to\nprobe the unknowns of thunderstorms by flying through\nthem, deliberately seeking\nout lightning strikes and\nother phenomena to assess\ntheir effects on the aircraft.\nOne aspect of this research\nwill be the investigation of\nways to protect on-board avionics systems against a direct\nlightning strike on the aircraft.\nThe violent turbulence of a\nthunderstorm has a parallel in\nthe miniature tornado generated by the passage through\nstill air of a large and heavy\nairplane, such as the widebodied transports now\noperating almost everywhere.\n\nTheir wingtips generate a\nvortex flow, a rotating and\nexpanding cone of highenergy air, strong enough to\ntumble a smaller and lighter\naircraft passing into its field of\ninfluence. Much study has\ngone into understanding and\nattempting to defeat the\ntrailing vortex because, in\nsome cases, the strengths of\nthese vortices determine the\nsafe spacing between landings\nat an airport.\nOne promising solution is\nthe use of an aerodynamic\n\n14\n\n\xe2\x80\x98I!\n\nspoiler to break up the vortex. Flight research of spoilers\non a modified Boeing 747 is\nbeing done, first, as an approach to reducing the\nstrength of the vortex generated by the airplane\xe2\x80\x99s passage,\nand second, to understand the\ngeneral mechanism of that\ngeneration. The method\nshows promise for reducing\nthe present separation distance from six miles to three,\nwith a corresponding improvement in airport capacity.\nAs a sidelight, all vortices\n\nare not potentially dangerous\nor harmful. Generation of a\nwingtip vortex by agricultural\nsprayer and duster aircraft\nhelps lay down a swath of insecticide or fertilizer. But not\nall operators agree that\ngenerating a vortex is the best\nmethod to distribute material\nthrough the wake of the aircraft, and one of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nmany unusual research programs is investigating ways to\nspread materials from lowflying planes.\n\nStudy\n\ni\nn\nContrasts\n\nI\n\nAH\nT h e r e could hardly be more\ndifference between the shape\nand function of an angular agricultural aircraft and those of\na sleekly contoured supersonic fighter. Yet understanding how both of them\nwork finds common ground\nin understanding the basic\nflow fields around them, and\nthe effects their shapes have\non that field.\nThe traditional way to determine flow fields around\naircraft has been by calculation, later verified or corrected by wind-tunnel and\nflight tests. In earlier times,\n\nthis routine was done with\nslide rules and desk calculators. Those techniques\nresulted in approximations\nthat were accurate enough for\nthe unsophisticated airplanes\nof the time. But in more recent years, the increasing\ncomplexity of aircraft has\nbeen matched by the availability of the computer to\nhandle the real chores of\nairflow computations very\nrapidly and efficiently. But\neven the advanced capabilities of contemporary computers are not sufficient to\nsolve the highly complex flow\n\nequations that result from a\ntrue three-dimensional situation in the presence of a turbulent boundary-layer flow.\nFor two-dimensional flow,\nthe situation is different. In\n1970, it took the most advanced computer of its day six\nhours to compute a twodimensional flow field,\nexcluding the effects of the\nboundary layer, a thin,\nslow-moving sheet of air next\nto the surface. By 1980, computer capabilities had increased so that the same calculation could be performed\nin five to ten minutes, in-\n\n.\nAerodynamic evaluation of an\nagricAturaI aircraft in tie\nfull-scale wind tunnel at the\nLangley Research Center revealed some potential improvements in this specialized\ntype of aircraft. Tuftswere fastened to the external surfaces of\nthe entire aiplane for a visual\nstudy of airflowpatterns. Darkened sectors behind tuft attachment points vividly show\nregions of airflow instability.\n\n15\n\nSplitting a model on a vertical\nplane through the centerline is\none method devised by Langley\nResearch Center scientists to reduce t o a minimum the interference ejfects of wind-tunnel\nmounting arms. In this Unitary Plan wind tunnel at\nLangley, a model of a supercruiser design concept is being\ntested. The dividing plane can\nbe seen splitting the model into\nleji and right halves. The\nwingtip suspension system holds\nthe complete model.\nAerodynamicforces on the ldt\nside are measured and are affected minimally by the method\nof suspension.\n\ncluding the boundary-layer\neffects.\nReynolds\xe2\x80\x99 Number (RN) is\na dimensionless parameter\nused as one basis for comparison of the results of windtunnel tests with those of\nfull-scale flight. The closer\nthe Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 numbers correspond, the closer the test results agree. To attain fullscale R N values in a smallscale wind tunnel is very difficult, and the story of\nwind-tunnel development has\nbeen told largely in terms of\nthe quest for higher and\nhigher R N values. Highpressure tunnels have been\ndeveloped to obtain an increase through an increase in\nair density. High-speed tunnels also increase the R N\nvalue. Use of the largest\nmodel size possible raises the\nvalue further. The only place\nleft for improvement now\nseems to be a lowering of the\nviscosity of the working fluid.\nAnd considerations of that\nneed, plus some other problems, led to the development\nof the NTF tunnel.\nIt is a cryogenic tunnel; its\nworking fluid is supercooled\n\nnitrogen gas. It is also a\npressure tunnel working at\nnearly nine times the outside\natmospheric pressure. Its test\nsection is about 2.5 meters\nsquare, and a typical model\nwill have a one-meter\nwingspan. The predicted\nvalues of R N will correspond\nmore nearly to those attained\nin a much larger wind tunnel,\nsay in a test section on the\norder of eight meters square.\nNASA sees a future need\nfor further increases in\ncapacity and capability of its\ncomputational facilities. To\nput this future need into\nperspective, consider\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful computer on-line in 1980. It handles between 20 and 140 million operations per second,\nand can store a million\n\xe2\x80\x9cwords.\xe2\x80\x9dTo compute some of\n\n16\n\nthe flow patterns around today\xe2\x80\x99s and tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s aircraft,\nscientists foresee a need to\nprocess one billion operations each second, and to\nstore 40 million words.\nThe development and procurement costs for such an\nadvanced computer are high,\nand the time required for\nputting it in place is long, so it\nmay well be several years before new computational\nfacilities will go on line.\nThe wind-tunnel facility\npicture is brighter. Even\nthough this revolutionary\ncomputational capability is\nneeded to understand fully\nthe complex flow patterns,\nthe theories still need to be\nselectively verified by experiment. Assisting in this\nverification of theory are advanced research tools such as\n\nthe National Transonic Facility (NTF) tunnel, scheduled\nto start calibration runs in\n1983. When it is fully operational, it will increase greatly\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain accurate wind-tunnel predictions of full-scale\nphenomena. The key is the\nattainability of large\nReynolds\xe2\x80\x99 numbers. Wind\ntunnels have other problems,\nsince they are not perfect research tools. For example, the\npresence of the test section\nwall is an artificial constraint\non any testing. N o real\nairplane flies around surrounded by a solid surface\nthat does not match the\nstreamlines of flow. But suppose a wind-tunnel wall could\nbe made to conform to those\nshapes? Some early research\nand tests reflect optimism\n\nFast, Faster,\nFastest..\n\n.\n\nConceprual model of a\nsupercruiser fighter design\nshows one of the characteristic\naerodynamic shapes evolved in\nthe NASA study program. The\ngeometry is that of a blended\nwing-body configuration,using\na highly swept delta wing as the\nbasic shape, and adding the unusual wingtips which are swept\n\nthat it can be done. NASA,\nworking in conjunction with\nBritish scientists at the University of Southampton, has\ndevised an adaptive wall that\nis self-streamlining. It has a\nflexible floor and ceiling, and\nways to measure the pressure\npattern inside the test section.\nUsing that pressure data and\nother information, the tunnel\ntest section adjusts its shape\nuntil the flow through it\nmatches the computed velocity distribution in free air.\nModels are held in any\nwind tunnel generally at the\nend of a long arm, filled with\nmeasurement systems that\nsense the movement of the\narm and translate that into\nforce measurements. But the\nvery presence of that arm in\nthe test section affects the validity of the tests. What is\n\naft and up. This particular\nmodel is being tested in one of the\nLangley Unitary Plan wind\ntunnels, using a unique method\nof suspension to reduce model\nsupport intetference to an absolute minimum. The model is\nsplit longitudimlly along a\nvertical plane through the\ncenterline.\n\nneeded is no physical suspension at all. The model should\nbe free in space, the way its\nreal counterpart is.\nResearchers at NASA and\nabroad have been studying\nthis particular problem for\nsome years, and have begun\nto evolve a system of magnetic suspension that does not\nintrude into the test section.\nThe model is held in a strong\nmagnetic field, and is free of\nany interference effects that\nmight be caused by a conventional suspension system.\nThe new NTF eventually\nmay incorporate these latter\ntwo concepts in its test section. Developmental systems\nhave been built on smaller\nscales and have been tested\nfor applicability.\n\nT h e demand for flight at\nhigher and higher speeds has\nbeen a major reason for the\ndevelopment of such advanced analytical and research tools as future computers and the National\nTransonic Facility. Historically, increases in speed have\nbeen associated with the development of military aircraft, particularly fighters.\nMore recently, the program\nfor an American supersonic\ntransport generated some\nnew and different requirements for high-speed aircraft\ndesign. Most recently, after\nthe cancellation of the SST\nand the shift in emphasis to\nsupersonic research aimed at\nfighter design, a number of\nmodern technologies became\npart of the synthesis. And\nsynthesis it is; no modern\nairplane is designed around a\nsingle predominant feature.\nNow it must use the best of\nthe contemporary arts and\nsciences in aerodynamics,\nstructural concepts, propulsion, control, materials and\navionics. To do less is to\ndoom the design to a secondrate position.\n\nSpeed and maneuverability\nare the major qualities sdught\nfor a military fighter aircraft,\nand they are needed for its\noffensive performance as well\nas for its own defense. But\nspeed and maneuverability\nhave tended to be mutually\nexclusive. The high-speed\nfighters of the past did their\nbest maneuvering at velocities well below their maxima,\nand at peak speed performance were capable only\nof gentle turns. That no\nlonger is good enough, and\nthe latest military designs, including such in-service types\nas the McDonnell-Douglas\nF-15A and the General\nDynamics F-16A, show combinations of speed and maneuverability never before\nachieved.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to build maneuverability into a combination of a high-speed airframe\nand a human pilot. High maneuverability subjects the airframe to loads that are several\ntimes normal and frequently\nunsymmetrical. It imposes a\nsevere strain on the aircraft,\nthe pilot, and all the control\nsystems. It may even trigger\n\n17\n\nmodels are more economical.\n\nThe HiMAT vehicle used in\nNASA\'s program to study\nHighly Maneuverable Aircraft\nTechnology is a scaled-down remotely piloted research aircraft.\nThis experimental technique\nwas developed by NASA several\nyears ago and is useful to study\nhigh-risk technologies.

It is another example of\nNASA\'s approach to research, because HiMAT\nbegan as a series of analytical\nand computerized studies,\nprogressed to tests of scale\nmodels in a number of wind\ntunnels, and now is in the\nflight-research stage, using\nunmanned, remotely piloted\nvehicles approximately half\nthe size of a typical fighter\ndesign.\nHiMAT has two basic\ntasks. First& is used to study\nthe interrelated problems of\nall aspects of the flight of a\ntypical advanced fighter configuration. Second, it is contributing to the design of future fighter types by furnishing fundamental aerodynamic\nand structural loads data that\n\nwill assist designers in\nindustry.\nHiMAT is a joint NASAI\nUSAF program, with the design and construction of its\ntest vehicles being the responsibility of Rockwell International\'s Los Angeles\nAircraft Division. The basic\nconcept of HiMAT is that of a\nclose-coupled canard layout,\nwith advanced airfoil design\nand aeroelastic tailoring. It is\na subscale model of an advanced fighter, synthesized\nby Rockwell designers as\ntypical of the year 1990.\nThe detailed design\nspecified a core vehicle with a\nbasic engine, airframe and\nsystems. The remaining components were designed as\nmodules that could easily be\nattached to the core vehicle,\nand just as easily replaced by\ndifferent or developed units\nas the program progressed.\nComposite materials account for nearly one-third of\nthe airframe structural weight\nof the HiMAT vehicles and,\nfor the first time, these new\nmaterials are being used to\ncapitalize on the ability to\ngive them unidirectional\n\n18\n\nThe HiMAT vehicle makes its\nfinal approach for landing on\nthe lake bedat the Dryden Flight\nResearch Center, Edwards,\nCalifornia.I t uses landing skiis\nrather than wheels to absorb the\n\nshock of landing and to furnish\nthe braking required to stop the\nvehicle. The remotely piloted vehicle can sustain, typically,\ntwice the rate of turn of contemporary fighters because of the\n\nstiffness. The composite wing\nand canard surfaces are designed so that the natural\nbending of both surfaces\nunder maneuvering loads will\ncontrol the changing of the\naerodynamic shape of the\nHiMAT to maintain optimum\nlift and drag conditions.\nFlights of HiMAT begin\nwith an air launch from\'a\nmodified Boeing B-52D aircraft. The research pilot sits in\na cockpit on the ground at\nNASA\'S Dryden Flight Re-\n\nsearch Center, and he flies the\nvehicle from there, monitoring its performance on a\nseries of displays typical of a\nfighter cockpit. A backup\ncontroller, aloft in a Lockheed TF-l04G, can assume\ncommaqd of HiMAT if\nground control is lost.

Its modular design makes it relatively\neasy to change a major component, such as an engine\ninlet or nozzle, and to evalu-\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s an old saying in aviation that if an airplane looks\nright, it will fly right. There is\nalso an old maxim that every\nrule has an exception. Combine these, and you have an\nimpression of the NASA\noblique-wing aircraft, a concept that looks as wrong as\npossible. On one side, a wing\nlunges forward to meet the\noncoming air; on the other\nside, it sweeps back.\nAnd it flies right.\nThis radical departure from\nthe conventional geometry of\naircraft layouts was devised\nby NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Robert T. Jones,\nand first advanced by him\nseveral decades ago. Great\nate it under test conditions in skepticism greeted the idea,\neven though it had been\nfree flight.

He used\nsmall radio-controlled models which flew well and continued to dumfound the\ncasual observer.\nOblique wing studies had\nbeen extended earlier to the\nrequirements of supersonic\nflight and had shown, surprisingly to some, that the\nodd shape offered amajor advantage in the design of a\nsupersonic transport. Analysis and wind-tunnel work\ndone at Ames Research\nCenter pointed to a fuel\neconomy twice as good as that\nof the first generation of operational supersonic transa\nports. There w s a bonus: The\nconcept seemed to produce a\nsubstantially weaker sonic\nboom, one of the banes of\nsupersonic flight.\nNASA funded the design\nand construction of a small,\npiloted research aircraft with\na pivoting wing. This proofof-concept vehicle was built\nby the Ames Industrial Corp.,\n\n19\n\nBohemia, NY, and the aircraft now is flying in an exploratory program that will\ncheck out the subsonic flight\ncharacteristics of the unusual\nwing concept. The research\nvehicle, designated the AD-1,\nis built of foam and fiberglass.\nIt has a 32-foot wingspan and\na 40-foot length, and weighs\nin at a total of 1,800 pounds.\nIts powerplant is a pair of\n200-pound thrust turbojet\nengines.\nFor low-speed flight, the\nwing stays at a right angle to\nthe fuselage centerline, and\nprovides all of the excellent\ncharacteristics of a straight-\n\nwinged airplane. In that configuration, it has good\nstability and control qualities,\nno need for ornate high-lift\nsystems, and reduced engine\nthrust for takeoff. For highspeed flight, the wing pivots\nto angles up to 60 degrees\nwith respect to the aircraft\ncenterline. The drag is decreased substantially.\nOnce again, the progression from an idea through\nanalysis, wind-tunnel tests\nand into flight research underscores NASA\'s systematic\napproach to a new and unique\nconcept for the improvement\nof aeronautics.\n\n20\n\nThe Science\nof\nShapes\n\nI\n\n~\n\nThe Ames-Dryden- 1 (AD-1),\nphotographed during a test\nflight from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Dryden\nFlight Research Center, is being\nflown to study the concept of the\noblipe wing. Invented by Ames\nResearch Center scientist Robert\nT .Jones, the oblique wing is\npivoted at a centralpoint spanwise. Rotated by actuators, one\nwing tip movesforward and the\nother aftto sweep angles up to 60\ndegrees with the fuselage centerline. This aircraft,flown by\npilots of the Dtyden Plight Research Center, is an example of\nthe NASA r$v-oof-of-concept\xe2\x80\x9d\napproach in aeronautical\nresearch.\n\nO n e of the historic tasks at\nNASA has been the development of new shapes of\nflight. The years have seen\nthe biplane, with its struts and\nwires, give way to the cantilevered monoplane. Straight\nwings made way for sweepback, then for variable sweep,\nwith the special case of the\noblique wing mentioned\nabove. The search for more\nspeed and more efficient aircraft has recently led to a\nfamily of shapes in which the\nwing and the fuselage are\nblended into an integrated\nwhole of sweeping and CUNing surfaces.\nPart of this work has been\naimed at the \xe2\x80\x9csupercruise\xe2\x80\x9d\nclass of airplanes, designs that\nare intended to fly economically and efficiently at supersonic speeds. At first, NASA\nprograms in this area concentrated on the specific\nneeds of the U.S. supersonic\ntransport. But now the work\nis aimed primarily at the development of new shapes for\nfighter aircraft, shapes that\nwill permit unusual maneuverability coupled with\ndazzling speed and the ability\n\nto accelerate to supersonic\nflight rapidly and efficiently.\nOne of the things learned\nin these studies has been the\nimportance of the strake, a\nfairing that stretches from the\nleading edge of the wing to a\npoint forward on the fuselage.\nOn a very high speed aircraft,\nthat strake may become a\nmajor portion of the lifting\nsurface. It can be used to\ncreate a vortex that generates\nlift, and to apply that lift toward maneuverability. The\nconcept is an exciting one,\nand it is finding applications\nin the new generation of\nfighter aircraft.\nAircraft efficiency is measured simply; it is the ratio of\nlift to drag. The higher that\nratio, the more efficient the\nairplane. The major problem\nin supersonic flight is that the\nlift-drag ratio inherently has\nnot been high, and it has not\nbeen easy to raise the modest\nvalues that are routinely\nattained.\nConsequently, NASA has\nbeen analyzing ways to increase lift and reduce drag of\nwings, shaping them to the\nneeds of supersonic flight. As\n\n21\n\nExperiments with plastic coatings to reduce skin friction drag\non wing and tail surfaces are\nbeing done on a Boeing 727 operated by Air Micronesia in a\ntropical environment. Two dgferent types of coatingsChemglaze M3 13 and\nCAAPCO B-274-ure being\nevaluatedfor drag reduction\nand resistance to the particular\nenvironmental factors of the air\noperations in Micronesia. Potential fuel savings from small\ndrag reductions are substantial,\nand increase with the increasing\ncost ofjetfuel. Thissketchshows\nthe location and extent of the\nplastic coatings.\n\na further refinement, these\nwings then are fitted with a\nvariety of high-lift devices, to\nimprove their characteristics\nin the takeoff and landing regimes of flight. Some of these\nideas are finding applications\nin the ACEE program as well\nas on the futuristic shapes\nbeing developed for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s fighting aircraft.\nChasing down drag is an\nendless task. N o sooner does\none component seem to have\nbeen brought to the irreducible minimum of drag production than another shows as a\ncontributor of sizable drag increment to the aircraft. A jet\nengine installation on a contemporary transport is a typical example. There is a flow\ninterference in the region\nbetween the wing and the engine nacelle, and it adds a substantial sum to the total drag\nof the aircraft. And because\nthere are, typically, either two\nor four of these intersections\nbetween wing and nacelle on\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s transports, it\xe2\x80\x99s a region worth exploring with the\naim of reducing its contribution to aircraft drag.\nNASA investigators are\n\n,\xe2\x80\x98hemgIaze\nM313\n\n-+\n\n\\\nCAAPCO\n3-274\n\nconcentrating on proper\nshaping of the pylon that\nholds the engine nacelle to\nthe wing, looking to smooth\nthe flow under the wing and\nto reduce any tendencies for a\ncrossflow to develop.\nWind-tunnel tests of pylon\nredesigns and other modifications have shown ways to\nreduce their drag contribution.\nAircraft control surfaces\nare sized to meet the stability\nand control requirements\nspelled out in Federal Aviation Administration or other\ncognizant agency regulations\nand handbooks. The surfaces\n$e large, because they are designed to static stability requirements. The tail surfaces\nact like a weathervane\xe2\x80\x99s tail;\nthey keep the airplane-or\nthe weathervane-pointed\ninto the relative wind. They\nare passive controls; they\n\n22\n\nreact to a disturbance.\nActive controls are a subject under major study at\nNASA. The approach is on\nthe basis of what are called\n\xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d stability requirements, in which an instability\nis anticipated by sensors and\ntransformed into signals to\nthe control surfaces to correct\nfor that instability even as it is\noccurring. By doing that, the\ncontrol surfaces can be made\nsmaller, and therefore lighter,\nthan normally. Anything that\nsaves weight and size also reduces the drag and the\namount of power required to\nfly. And that, in turn, reduces\nthe amount of fuel burned. So\nthe active control programs\nunder investigation at NASA\nhave been aimed at the broad\ngoals of the ACEE efforts,\nand in related studies for applications outside the transport field.\n\nAn obvious way to reduce\nairplane drag is to wax its\nsurface. O n a small personal\naircraft that\xe2\x80\x99s feasible; on a\nBoeing 747 it\xe2\x80\x99s not very practical. But coating the airplane\nwith some sort of a synthetic\nsurface might achieve the\nsame results as hours and\nhours spent waxing the exterior. NASA has funded a\nstudy of airplane coatings\nwith Air Micronesia, whyse\nBoeing 727s work in the\nSouth Pacific islands, in an\nenvirohment of sand and\ncoral abrasion, torrential\nrains, torrid Sun, and salt\nspray. The leading edges of\nthe wings and rail of one of\nthe airline\xe2\x80\x99s 727s have been\ncoated, and are being studied\nover a long time period to assess the effects of the coatings\non performance, and the effects of the environment on\nthe coatings.\n\nGeneral Aviation\nPrograms\n\nG e n e r a l aviation is a catch-all\nterm to describe a very important segment of\naeronautics. It includes all of\nprivate flying, all of corporate\nand executive transportation,\nall of agricultural flying, much\nof the newly emerging commuter air transportation market, and a miscellany of antique aircraft, restored\nmuseum pieces, homebuilt\nplanes, gliders, and hot-air\nballoons. The list is long, and\nindicative of the variety and\ngrowing importance of general aviation.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s interest in this always-growing field goes back\nto the early 1920s, and the\nearly years of the NACA.\nEven then, the agency was investigating ways to make personal aircraft more reliable,\nsafer, and more efficient.\nCurrently, NASA focuses\nits attention on several basic\nproblem areas in general aviation. The first, and most important, is improving safety.\nA second is improving the\nenvironmental characteristics\nof the aircraft and engines,\nreducing their noise levels\nand emissions of exhaust\n\nLeading-edge slats, extending\nwellfirward of the outer wing\npanels of this typical light\ntwin-engined general aviation\naircrafi, were evaluated in\nLangley Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nfull-scale wind tunnel. Wing\nand engine nacellesudaces carry\n\nhundreds of tufts, used as visual\nindicators of the direction and\ntype of localairflw. This particular test was part of a continuing series at NASA to\nstudy, evaluate, and derive\naerodynamic improvementsfor\ntypical general aviation air-\n\ncraf. These full-scale tunnel\ntests can later be correlated with\nactualflight tests of the aircraft,\nt o determine the degree of agreement between the two sets\nof results.\n\nproducts. A third is improving the energy efficiency by\nimproving the performance\nof major components and\nsystems. NASA also has emphasized increased utility in\nits studies.\nOne way to improve safety\nis to study how airplanes\ncrash, in the hope of finding\nsome basic structural or other\ndesign changes that will increase the survivability of\ncrew and passengers in an accident. For several years,\nNASA has been deliberately\ncrashing a number of singleand twin-engined lightplanes\n\nin a carefully controlled, instrumented and documented\nseries of spectacular impacts.\nAs the result of a flood a few\nyears ago, which inundated\nthe final assembly lines of a\nmajor manufacturer of general aviation aircraft, NASA\nacquired a number of nearly\ncompleted airframes. These\nhad been condemned as unairworthy because of water\ndamage, but they became\nuseful research tools.\nThe crash tests at the\nLangley center have progressed from the early few,\nwhich were essentially guided\n\nfree-falls onto concrete\npavement. More recently,\nsmall rocket motors have\nbeen installed in the engine\nnacelles to boost the impact\nvelocity in a simulation of\ncrashes at higher speeds.\nExtensive instrumentation\nin the aircraft as well as outside, high-speed photography, and other means are\nused to acquire data and to\ndocument the crashes. Anthropomorphic dummies are\nharnessed in crew and\npassenger positions, instrumented and photographed to assess their\n\n23\n\nThis spectacular photograph\nshows a light twin-engined\ngeneral aviation aircrafi moments before its impact with a\nrunway sudace in the seuenteenth of a series of crash tests at\nthe Langley Research Center.\nFlame streaks are the exhaust of\nfour solid-propellant rockets\nwhich thrust the plane to a\nhigher impact speed than is\npossible i n a simple grauityaccelerated drop.

New concepts in passenger seats, evaluated in high-speed rocket\nsled tests by the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s Civil\nAir Aeromedical Institute,\nlater were installed in test\nairframes for the crashes.\nIn a related effort, energyabsorbing structural design\ntechniques were used to\nmodify the fuselages of\ncrash-test airframes. Postcrash examination of the\nfuselages and the insttumentation results was used to assess the applicability of the\nnew designs for future\nlight aircraft.\nThe best way to survive an\naccident is not to have one, of\ncourse. One of the major\nlong-term areas of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nactivity in general aviation is\nin the investigation of stalls\nand the spins that sometime\nfollow. A leading cause of\ncivil air accidents, the stall/\nspin is a phenomenon that increasingly is being understood, analyzed, and coun-\n\ntered. Typically, research\nstarts with a small dynamically\nsimilar model of an airplane\nwhich is tested in the spin\ntunnel at Langley. Recently,\nthese tests have been followed by free-flights of radio-controlled scale models,\nand finally by flight research\nwith the real aircraft. Several\ngeneral aviation aircraft serve\nNASA as vehicles for stall/\n\n24\n\nspin flight research. One was\nmodified so that a number of\nvertical tail designs could be\ninstalled for investigation of\ntheir effect on the stall/spin\nrecovery. Other design modifications have included the\naddition of strakes (fin-like\nsurfaces) and, most important\nof all, changes to wing leading\nedge configurations. The\nwing leading edge configura-\n\ntion has been discovered to\nhave apowerful effect on spin\nresistance.\nA major program to demonstrate the technology for a\nQuiet, Clean General Aviation Turbofan (QCGAT) engine was established by the\nLewis Research Center, with\nfunded contract work placed\nwith industry. The goal was to\nshow that the technology of\n\nThe suspension system that asrums the correct angle of impact\nwith the conrete sudace in these\nNASA crash tests is being\nchecked here before hoisting the\nlight twin-engined aircraft t o\nits release point. This test, seventeenth in a series of controlled\ncrashes t o investigate aircraft\nstructural behavior following\nimpact, used four solid-propel&antrockets mounted in the rear\nof the engine nacelles t o accelerate the airframe t o a higher\nspeed than possible with a gravity drop. External paint scheme\ndefines the internal structure of\nthe aircraft, so that high-speed\nphotography can show the\nprogression of airframe reaction\nafter impact.\n\nnoise and emission reduction,\ncommon to large turbofan\nengines, could be transferred\nto the design and development of turbofan engines in\nthrust categories useful for\nsome general aviation aircraft. Garrett\'s AiResearch\nManufacturing Co. and Avco\nLycoming each modified an\nexisting engine in their commercial line to meet the requirements of the program.\nThe major effort was directed\ntoward reducing the noise\nlevel, and that was achieved in\nboth engines. A second goal\nwas to reduce the carbon\nmonoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen emitted; that, too, was\nachieved. One constraint was\nto accomplish these reductions without any increases in\nthe fuel consumption. Actually, the fuel consumption\ndecreased significantly.\nA series of four study programs, also with industry,\nlooked at the feasibility of developing small turboprop engines for general aviation in\nthe 300 to 700 shafthorsepower range, where they\ncould compete with highly\n\nAircraft structure behavior on\nimpact with the ground is being\nstudied in an on-going program\nat the Langley Research Center.\nUsingpIanestypical of the light\nsingle- and twin-engined aircraft in general aviation use,\nNASA engineers deliberately\nrelease the planes along a controlledflight path onto a concrete apron. Highspeed cameras\nand other instrumentation record the loads, decelerations and\ndistortions of the aircraft. lnstrumented anthropomorphic\ndummies, which accurately\nsimulate the human frame, may\nbe included in the test t o study\nthe survivability aspects of a\nparticular type of impact. This\nsequence reads from top t o\nbottom, t o show the stages from\ninitial impact through subsequent deceleration to a stop.\nBoth NASA and the FAA support this testprogramas one way\nof helping t o increase occapant\nsurvivability in general aviation accidents.\n\n25\n\nBuilding It Stronger\n\nOne of two competing quiet,\nclean general aviation turbofan\nengines (QCGAT), developed\nunder contracts funded by\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s h i s Research Center,\nshows the general configuration\nof thepowerplant.Purpose of the\nprogram was to demonstrate\ntransferof technology from commercially available, large turbofan engines to smaller engines\nin a lowerpower class. Garrett\xe2\x80\x99s\n\ndeveloped internal combustion engines. The aim of the\nstudies was to see if such engines appeared feasible in the\nlight of fuel consumption,\nweight and cost constraints.\nThe studies indicate that this\nshould be possible with advanced technology engine\ncomponents and manufacturing techniques. Advanced\ntechnology programs are\nbeing proposed to achieve\nthese objectives.\nAdditionally, propeller design, frozen in the past with\nfew exceptions, has been long\noverdue for a transfusion of\nmodern technology. NASA\nhas been looking at ways to\n\nA iResearch Manufacturing\nCompany-their engine is\nshown here-nd Avco Lycoming both developed an existing\nengine to the requirements of\ngeneral aviation. Both manufacturers achieved major reductions in noise level, and in\nthe emission levelsfor carbon\nmonoxide-andunburned\nhydrocarbons.\n\nincrease propeller efficiency,\nthrough such possible\nchanges as the use of modern\nairfoils instead of the older\nconventional airfoils normally used. New designs include NASA\xe2\x80\x99s supercritical\nairfoil technology for appropriate flow regimes. The\ncomposite materials also offer\npromise, because the indicatians are that propellers could\nbe built with less weight and\nwith better structural\ncharacteristics and fatigue life\nusing modern composite\nstructural design technology.\nFurther, their aerodynamic\nperformance would show a\nmajor improvement.\n\n26\n\nT h e dynamics of the aircraft\ncrashes at Langley have led to\nthe development of new seat\ndesign concepts and seat restraint systems. But they also\nhave led to a careful analysis\nof the way an airframe is damaged in a crash, how the progressive destruction of the\nairframe moves from the\npoint of impact throughout\nthe structure. It may be that\nsome simple changes will be\nfound to increase the\ncrashworthiness of aircraft.\nThese studies have been extrapolated to large transports,\nand all three major manufacturers of airliners have NASA\ncontracts to investigate the\nproblem of crashworthiness\nin airplanes of the size they\ndesign and build.\nUnderstanding how\nsomething fails is the key to\nefficient design of that piece.\nKnowing that, the design can\ntake into account some special feature that will delay or\neven prevent a specific mode\nof failure. One example is the\nuse of small extruded trips of\nmetal on a pressurized fuselage skin panel to act as ripstoppers. Another example is\nthe tailoring of a composite\nstructure to absorb the load\n\nalong an axis of particular\nstrength.\nComposites seem to be\nvery useful materials for aircraft structures. Made from\nfibers of carbon or other\nhigh-strength substances imbedded in a matrix, these new\nmaterials can be formed into\nstructures replacing many\ncomponents of modern aircraft. NASA has a long-term\nprogram in which control\nsurfaces, stabilizers, and\nfuselage fairings have been\ndesigned and built using\ncomposites. These parts, installed as replacement units\non commercial transports, are\nin long-term airline use to\nevaluate their durability in\nthe real world of routine\noperations.\nThese composite structures are very light and very\nstrong; they can be made very\nstiff, also. Or, the strength\nand deflection can be applied\nalong a specific path, or about\na specific axis. Other NASA\ncomposite structures are\nfound in the HiMAT research\nvehicles, and in a series of\nsub-scale test wings being\nflown on drones into a highspeed aerodynamic regime\nwhere flutter is studied.\n\nThe Future\nof\nAeronautics\n\nI n 1980, the cost of everything was of major concern,\nand the price of NASA research was no exception. Cost\nconsiderations have been the\nmajor reason behind the\nsometimes slow pace of\naeronautical research. But,\nbecause industry finds itself\nfacing the same problems, it\nhas been turning increasingly\nto NASA for the funding of\nresearch programs that might\nhave been regarded as proprietary subjects a few years\nago. A strong case can be\nmade for doing the kind of research that industry wants and\nneeds, based on the NASA\ncharter defined by the 1958\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Act.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s record has shown\nthat its research and technology programs have advanced\nthe progress of aviation. Its\npresent programs are making\nvaluable and timely contributions to the design of advanced fighters, to the safety\nof general aviation, to the improvement of air transport\noperations in areas of highdensity traffic. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future plans for modernization,\nsuch as those for the National\nTransonic Facility, were con-\n\nceived in the best tradition of\naeronautical research. That\ntradition, which began in\n1915 with the establishment\nof the National Advisory\nCommittee for Aeronautics,\nis agreat intangible advantage\nthat pervades the staff and\nlaboratories of today\xe2\x80\x99s\nNASA. Together, they constitute a national asset of great\nworth, of past proven performances, and of enormous\nfuture potential.\n\nThe HiMAT vehicle used in\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s program to study\nHigh& Maneuverable Aircraft\nTechnology is a scaled-down remote& piloted research aircraft.\n\nt\n\n27\n\nNational\nAeronautics and\nSpace\nAdministration\n\nPublic Affairs Division\nNASA Headquarters\nWashington, DC 20546\n\nEP-85\n\n'
