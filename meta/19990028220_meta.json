This paper assesses the efficacy of these PIDS and suggests that changes should be made. In particular, the structure developed in MIL-F-8785B (ASG) (the specification for flying qualities of piloted airplanes) should be incorporated. Improved requirements must be based on a systematic data base and concentrated on topics most important in preliminary design: static and dynamic stability, control power and sensitivity, and interaction with controllers and displays. Emphasis should be on current military helicopter missions and helicopter idiosyncrasies such as cross-coupling, nonlinearities, and higher-order dynamics.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990028220, "endDate": "1980-08-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "3fa1ec87dc8545d9b5d912768f6a1be0", "id": "a24c6ddae2944bbc88d57a579b50052b"}], "name": "Atmospheric Flight Mechanics Conference", "location": "Danvers, MA", "id": "3fa1ec87dc8545d9b5d912768f6a1be0", "startDate": "1980-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19990028220, "issue": "2", "publisher": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "id": "f4106223e5364e56842a3be6f11d79c9", "publicationName": "Journal of Aircraft", "publicationDate": "1982-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
