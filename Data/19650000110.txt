However, visual inspection alone\nis not reliable.\nThe solution: A pressure-adjustable spring-loaded\nprobe to test soldered, brazed, or microwelded joints.\nThe probe is more reliable than mere visual inspection\nsince any desired test pressure may be applied to the\njoint.\nHow it's done: The spring-loaded probe may be\nadjusted to the desired test pressure by means of a\nthreaded probe head. As pressure is applied to the\nweld, the probe is forced into the probe housing, thus\ndepressing the spring. When the desired pressure has\nbeen applied to the weld, the probe makes contact\nwith a 1-1/2-volt penlight battery causing a 1-1/2-volt\nindicator lamp to be lighted. Visual inspection will\ndetermine whether or not the weld was able to withstand the test pressure.\n\n\t\n\n1-1/2 Volt Lamp\n\nNotes:\n1. The battery spring acts as an overtravel spring\nin case the test probe overtravels after the indicator\nlamp has been lighted.\n2. This device should find use in the electronics industry for the reliable testing of soldered, brazed, or\nmicrowelded joints.\nInquiries concerning this innovation may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nWestern Operations Office\n150 Pico Boulevard\nSanta Monica, California, 90406\nReference: B65-10111\nPatent status: NASA encourages commercial use\nof this innovation.
