This study took an initial look at what passengers expect from an eVTOL UAM flight experience \u2013 what aspects matter most, what might be acceptable, and where there are gaps in our understanding. The analysis included a literature search and interviews with experts from the aviation community to identify passenger concerns and potential mitigations. Passenger concerns were found to fall into six general categories: perceived safety, noise and vibration, availability and access, passenger well-being, concern for the environment, and vehicle motion. The study used a modified quality function deployment approach to correlate these passenger concerns with design and operational variables, highlighting how design and operational parameters can mitigate the passenger concerns. NASA research can address the passenger concerns by developing simulation capabilities and noise models, characterizing propulsion system performance, taking direct measurem and conducting further studies of market demand and design methods.\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20200000532, "id": "884b54f4228749049b65885d726c7c76", "publicationDate": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200000532.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200000532/downloads/20200000532.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200000532/downloads/20200000532.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200000532/downloads/20200000532.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
