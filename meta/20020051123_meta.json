A consequence of this objective is the provision for NASA to provide sufficient incentives to achieve partner buy-in and commitment to the program. NASA has identified seven specific areas in which substantive incentives will be offered: (1) partners will be offered participation in governance of GPM mission science affairs including definition of data products; (2) partners will be offered use of NASA's TDRSS capability for uplink and downlink of commands and data in regards to partner provided spacecraft; (3) partners will be offered launch support for placing partner provided spacecraft in orbit conditional upon mutually agreeable co-manifest arrangements; (4) partners will be offered direct data access at the NASA-GPM server level rather than through standard data distribution channels; (5) partners will be offered the opportunity to serve as regional data archive and distribution centers for standard GPM data products; and (6) partners will be offered the option to insert their own specialized filtering and extraction software into the GPM data processing stream or to obtain specialized subsets and products over specific areas of interest (7) partners will be offered GPM developed software tools that can be run on their platforms. Each of these incentives, either individually or in combination, represents a significant advantage to partners who may wish to participate in the GPM mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020051123, "id": "97690e7c81034f02971ecb782527a4c0", "publicationDate": "2002-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020051123.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020051123/downloads/20020051123.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020051123/downloads/20020051123.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020051123/downloads/20020051123.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
