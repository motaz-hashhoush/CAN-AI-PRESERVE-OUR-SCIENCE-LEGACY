This approach is intended to be especially useful in the early stages of the evolution of the system, before a complete control system concept has been defined. This methodology is based on a quantitative measure of the observability of the system for a given set of sensors. The effect of possible component failures during the mission period was incorporated in the measure. The question of sensor placement is then resolved by finding the locations which maximize the performance measure. The number of components to use cannot be determined by optimizing the measure because the observability always improves with increased number of sensors if they are optimally located. However, the improvement in the measure with component number can be determined, and this information can be used along with data on cost, power required, etc., to decide how many sensors to use.", "title": "Number and placement of control system sensors considering possible failures", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T14:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830027805, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vandervelde, W.
