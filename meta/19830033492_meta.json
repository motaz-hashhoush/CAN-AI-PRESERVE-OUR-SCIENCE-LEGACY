The present investigation has the objective to show an approach which is concerned with the formulation of incompatible elements for solid continuum and for plate bending problems by the Hellinger-Reissner principle. It is found that the resulting scheme is equivalent to that considered by Tong (1982) for the construction of hybrid stress elements. In Tong's scheme the inversion of a large flexibility matrix can be avoided. It is concluded that the introduction of additional internal displacement modes in mixed finite element formulations by the Hellinger-Reissner principle and the Hu-Washizu principle can lead to element stiffness matrices which are equivalent to the assumed stress hybrid method.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "18", "submissionId": 19830033492, "id": "9b7db5608c6c4f60978db985cbdd9406", "publicationName": "International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering", "publicationDate": "1982-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
