A theory of thrust generation by flapping wings can be developed if the conventional downstream velocity discontinuity surface is replaced with the observed Karman type vortex streets behind a flapping wing. Experiments show that the direction of such vortices is the reverse of that of conventional Karman streets. The streets form by breakdown of the boundary layer. Detailed analysis of the movements of certain birds and insects during flight 'in place' is fully consistent with this theory of the lift, thrust and drag of flapping wings. Further directions for research into flight with flapping wings are indicated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19800017776, "id": "f891d7997fbc4fd4b1b0c423be6ba007", "publicationDate": "1980-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19800017776.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19800017776/downloads/19800017776.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19800017776/downloads/19800017776.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19800017776/downloads/19800017776.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
