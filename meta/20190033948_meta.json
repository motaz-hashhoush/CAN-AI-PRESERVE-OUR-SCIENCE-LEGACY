NASA was tasked with maintaining the collection\u2019s data inventory and supporting web pages at data.gov/climate. Today, the Data Curation for Discovery (DCD) team at MSFC continues to support the CDI collection. In order to expose the collection to a new and growing user community, the DCD team has partnered with GeoPlatform.gov to develop the Resilience community. The Resilience community serves as an interactive, topically-focused web portal that further promotes and shares CDI web content, datasets, services, maps, and other tools relevant to global resilience and change. This poster focuses on the team\u2019s efforts to leverage GeoPlatform\u2019s semantic applications to link CDI objects within the platform to improve discoverability. This poster also provides insights as to how this effort may serve as an example for building and expanding future Geoplatform.gov communities..", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190033948, "endDate": "2019-12-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU)", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "1def2b2e10534cfb9e74a266e5f6b3ff", "id": "2055098c731b41079d6684d1f158a34b"}], "name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting 2019 ", "location": "San Francisco, CA", "id": "1def2b2e10534cfb9e74a266e5f6b3ff", "startDate": "2019-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190033948, "id": "e1048fef52df47ae94c86e8b1c35b933", "publicationDate": "2019-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190033948.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190033948/downloads/20190033948.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190033948/downloads/20190033948.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190033948/downloads/20190033948.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
