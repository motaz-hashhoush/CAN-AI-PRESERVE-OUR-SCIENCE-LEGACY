This range was based on a maximum take-off gross weight of\n3.447 MN (775 000 lbf) which included 212 kN (47 700 lbf) pod weight and\n543 kN (122 000 lbf) payload (bridge launcher). To achieve the above range,\nthe 747 carrier airplane was stripped of non-essential items including\nits landing gear, which becomes unusable because of the height of the pod.\nA fixed-gear or completely retractable pod-mounted gear will replace the\noriginal 747 gear. No pressurization was provided in the pod and, therefore,\na military restriction to 5.5 km (18 000 ft/ cruise altitude for unpressurized cargo applies.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe objective of this stuy was to determine the feasibility of mounting\na removable, external pod on the Boeing 747 aircraft for carrying military\ncargo. Criteria for the feasibility of the concept were, to minimize the\nmodifications to the carrier aircraft, and the installation time required\nto attach the external pod to the Boeing 747.\n\nA mobile bridge launcher was specified as the largest single piece\nof equipment that the pod would need to accommodate. This bridge launcher\nhas a weight of \'543 kN (122 000 lbf) and requires a minimum cargo compartment height of 4.11 m 03.5 ft), a width of 4.27 m (14.0 ft), and a length\nof 9.30 m (30.5 ft). These dimensions included clearances between the \t\n\nti.\n\nlauncher and the cargo compartment structure.\n\nAnother criterion was the capability of the 747 with pod and bridge\n\ni^\n\nlA\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\'\n\nlauncher payload to cover at least the distance from the east coast of\nthe United States to Europe without refueling at the military restricted\n\naltitude for unpressurized cargo of 5.5 km (18 000 ft).\n\nBecause of the height of the pod, the 747 existing landing gear was\nrepl_-ced by a gear on the pod. A pod was configured and evaluated in conjunc-\n\nCon with three different types of pod-mounted landing gear. This evaluation\nincluded the pod Height and a structure analysis; the structural mating\nof the pod with the carrier; the aerodynamic drag and \'the range performance\n\npenalties imposed by the pod; and the method of mating the pod to the 747.\n\nSYMBOLS\n\nC D\t\n\ndraq coefficient D/qs\n\nC L\t\n\nlift coefficient L/qs\n\nD\t\n\ndrag\n\nL\t\n\nlift\t\n\nM\t\n\nMach number\n\nT\t\n\nabsolute temperature\n\nTo\t\n\nabsolute temperature at sea level standard day\n\nTSFC\t\n\nthrust specific fuel consumption\n\na o\t\n\nspeed of sound at sea level/standard day\n\ne\t\n\ntemperature ratio, T/To\n\nORIGINAL PAjGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nI\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nY\n\nConfiguration\n\nA configuration design study was made for mounting a detachable pod\n\nagainst the botto^ of the Boeing 747 aircraft for hauling_ outsized cargo,\n\n4\n\n2\n1\n\ny\n\nq.\n\n1^ \t\n,J\n\nLLI-I\t\n\nEl\n\n1"\'\n\nI_\'__L - tl\t\n\n"\n\nspecifically a mobile bridge launcher or an M60 tank. The internal cargo\nvolume of the detachable pod was configured to accommodate the mobile bridge\nLauncher envelope since it was the largest of the two pieces of military\nequipment specified. A clearance of .46 m (18 in) was provided between\nthe pod side structure and the payload envelope for accessibility to the\ntie down fittings and for other flight or ground crew activity within the\ncargo area. The bridge launcher payload center of gravity was at the 747\nmid-travel center of gravity.\n\nClamshell doors (similar to the aft doors on the C-141) and a loading\nramp that retracts inside the cargo area, were provided at the rear of\nthe pod with sufficient clearances to permit straight-in loading (figs,\n1 and 2).\n\nBecause of the height of the pod, the existing 747 main landing gear\nand the nose gear cannot be wised. This landing gear system can either\nbe left on the aircraft in the retracted position, to save conversion time,\nor removed to save weight. The replacement landing gear consists of a\nfour-strut main gear and a single-strut nose landing gear mounted to the\npod. All taxi, take-off, and landing loads would be borne by this gear\nsystem.\n\nThe forward portion of the pod was extended forward to the Boeing\n747 fuselage station 400 bulkhead and shaped to provide for mounting the\nreplacement nose gear to the pod. This resulted in moving the nose gear\nposition from station 390 to station 770 in order to keep the strut to\nan acceptable length. The relocation necessitated changing the nose gear\nfrom a two-wheel truck to a four-wheel truck because of the increased tire\nloads. - The aircraft tip-over angle was still within the acceptable design\nspecifications limit.\n\nThree preliminary design concepts of the pod-mounted landing gear\nwere made forweight and drag evaluation: a retractable gear system that\nis fully enclosed within landing ,gear blisters (fig. 1); a fixed-gear system\n\n3\n\n1\n\nL..\t\n\n_..\t\n\n..,..r .e^ .. ... ........Cn .. ., .... ..:...w. .. .... _ . 4..\t\n\n._.0\t\n\naAu u..rJit. c\t\n\n..1 au ..\t\n\n.:...\n\nenclosed Within landing gear blisters and wheel covers (fig. 2) except\nfor tire protrusion sufficient to prevent damage to wheel fairing structure\nwith two flat tires; and a fixed fully-exposed wheel and strut design (fig.\n3). The latter gear arrangement was abandoned because of the unacceptably\nlarge aerodynamic drag.\nY\n\nFive primary structural attachments of the pod to the 747 aircraft\nWere selected; \t\n\nat fuselage station 400 (nose-landing-gear bulkhead) ;\n\nstation 1000 (center-wing-box front spar); station 1241 (center-wing-box\nrear spar); station 1350 (forward landing-gear-beam bulkhead); and station\n1480 (aft-landing-gear bulkhead). The nose landing gear vertical loads\nwould be reacted-by shear in the 747 fuselage station 400 bulkhead and\n\nf\n\nin the center-wing-box front spar at fuselage station 1000. For this purpose\na truss type construction was incorporated at the forward end of the pod\nin the shape of a triangle with the base corner points fastened to the\nstation 400 bulkhead and to the front spar, respectively. The forward\nmain, pod mounted, landing gear vertical loads would be reacted by shear\nin the center-Wing-box rear spar at fuselage station 1241 and the landing-gearbeam bulkhead at fuselage station 1350. The aft main landing gear vertical\nloads are absorbed by shear in the fuselage bulkhead at station 1480.\nTransfer of these loads from the landing gear to the 747 structure would\nbe through heavy bulkheads in the pod. Transfer of horizontal drag loads\nbetween pod and 747 fuselage would be by means of shear and would occur\nmainly in the region of the main-landing-gear attachments.\n\nTo achieve a snug mating of the pod to the 747 carrier, secondary\n\nattachment points will be necessary at certain intervals along the length of\nthe pod. These points were not defined in this study.\n\nStructural Analysis\n\nr\t\n\n,\n\nA preliminary strength analysis was conducted on the configurations\nshown in figures 1 and 2. The results of this analysis were utilized to \t\nsize structural members for the configuration design and weight evaluation.\n\n4\n\ni\n\n-\'I\n\n^#\t\n\nt\n\nCriteria adapted for the strength and weight analysis included: utilization of the existing 747 wing and fuselage hardpoints; minimum impact on the\nbasic 747 airframe; simple, reliable and fast pod attachment; and an unpressurized pod. The limit load factors were 2.5 g down (positive maneuver), 2.0 g\nup (taxi), 1.0 g side (maneuver), and 6.0 g forward (crash). A safety factor\nof 1.5 was used.\n\nAluminum was selected as the material for the pod. Forgings of 2014-T6\naluminum alloy are used for the landing gear support frames and their attachments to the 747 fuselage. The pod skin, formed frames, and built-up floor\nbeams are made of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The wheel fairings and all doors\nare also 7075-T6 aluminum alloy limited to .064 cm (.025 in) as a minimum\ngauge. The landing gear utilizes primarily high heat-treated steels;\nnamely, 4340 alloy with a strength of 1.930 GPa (280 ksi). In tension\napplications, the strength allowables were reduced to provide satisfactory\nfatigue life. Otherwise MIL-HDBK-5B room temperature "A" values were utilized.\n\nThe critical loading condition for most of the pod structure and attachments was the 2.0 g limit (3.0 ultimate) taxi condition. The main gear was also\n\'j\n\ncritical in this condition; the critical load being 2.531 MN (569 000 lbf)\n\ni\t\n\n(ultimate) per strut. The nose gear taxi load of 1.067 MN (240 000 lbf)\n\n1\n\n(ultimate) was much larger for the pod than the 547 kN (123 000 lbf) (ultimate)\nload for the basic aircraft. This was caused by the shorter distance between\nthe nose and main gear for the pod configuration than for the basic aircraft.\n\nThe landing gear frames at fuselage stations 1342.5 and 1463.5 (fig. 1\nand 2) were analyzed as rigid frames for carrying the gear loads to the 747\nattachments. The nose gear frame was analyzed as a simple truss. The pod\nskin and formed frames carry the gear drag and crash loads, along with rela,\n\ntively small airloads. The pod drag loads were sheared into the 747 structure\nprimarily in the region of the main g ear attachments. Concentrated loads\ninduced by the payload determine the floor beam sizes.\n\nThe weight associated with the above structural sizing of the pod and\n\nH\t\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n\n\t\n\ni\n\ni\t\n\n, tl\t\n\n7\n\nS^\n\n,\n\nJ\n\nlanding gear configurations Was presented in the weight analysis discussion.\n\nWeight Analysis\nA weight analysis was conducted for the two pod configurations shown in\nfigures 1 and 2. One pod was configured with a retractable pod-mounted gear\nhoused in blisters on the pod (fig. 1); the other pod incorporated a fixed\npod mounted gear, which is partially enclosed by blisters on the pod and fairings or covers on the wheels (fig. 2). The pod and pod-mounted landing gear\nweights were determined by using the prediction methods of reference 2 and a\nmass properties computer prog ram developed by the Vought Corporation Hampton\nTechnical Center. The results are shown in table I. The partially enclosed\nfixed gear version (fig. 2) incorporated a cantilever landing gear arrangement.\nThis results in heavier gear support frames (due to the load path) than the\nretractable gear configurations (fig. 1); however, this weight increase was\nmore than offset by the simpler and, therefore,, lighter gear.\n\nA preliminary analysis was conducted to determine the potential weight\nsaving that would accrue from replacing, wherever possible, aluminum and steel\nwith composites. This preliminary analysis indicated that the pod structure\nand gear assembly weight could be reduced approximately 15 percent from 199 kN\n(44 700 lbf) to 168 kN (37 800 lbf). A more detailed analysis may show additional weight savings from the use of composites.\n\nThe 747-2008 aircraft was selected as the carrier in this study based\non availability of weight data for this model. It was assumed that the furnishings.(seats) and the maiority of the standard and operational items (galley?,\nfood, etc.) would be removed prior to or durin g the pod attachment operation.\nIt was further assumed that the 747 landing gear would be removed (if adequate\ntime was available) to save weight, since it becomes unusable.\n\nWeight breakdowns of the basic 747 and of the aircraft with the pods\nare presented on table II. If the original landing gear had to remain on the\n-A\n\nairplane, the empty weight values for the configurations with pod would be\n144 kN (32 300 lbf) higher than shown.\n6\n\nORIGIN R\nOF P\t ^\n\n\t\n\nPN3 F, IS\nPX\n\nIn this study, the maximum takeoff gross weight was limited to 3.447 MM\n(775 000 lbf). Since the pod equipped with the fixed gear was somewhat lighter\nthan the pod with the retractable gear, the loaded aircraft with the fixed\ngear can be fueled to capacity while the take-off gross weight remains slightly\n,\n\nbelow the maximum current value.\n\nAerodynamic Drag\nThe minimum parasite drag of the 747 with pod was determined using a\ncomputer program developed by the Vought Corporation Hampton Technical Center.\nFor the input to this program, the pod was treated as a lower-lobe enlargement\nof the 747 fuselage.\n\nChanges in compressibility drag were ignored since the airplane with\npod was estimated to fly in a low speed regime where compressibility effects\nwill be negligible.\n\nThe minimum parasite drag of the combination of the 747 and the pod was\nincreased by the drag created by the pod-mounted landing gear. Three different\ntypes of landing gear were investigated. The simplest of these consisted of\nfixed fully-exposed wheels and struts as shown in figure 3. Since this arrangement resulted in a total airplane drag which exceeded the available thrust,\nit was eliminated from further consideration.\n\nA more complex gear arrangement (fig. 2) was considered in which the\nfixed gear was nearly completely encased in blisters on the pod. As in the\ncase of the cargo pod discyassed above, the pod mounted landing gear blisters\nand wheel covers were treated as part of the fuselage in the computation of\nthe parasite drag; however, an additional blister-drag contribution (to account\nfor flow separation and derived from unpublished Lockheed C-5A data) Was included.\nThe drag caused by the exposed parts of the wheels was estimated from reference\n3. The resulting drag polar for the aircraft with pod, blisters, wheel covers,\nand partially exposed wheels is shown in figure 4. \t\n\na ;.\n\nThe third landing gear evaluated for possible use on the study airplane\n7\n\na\n\n\t\n4\n\n\'\n\n^ i\t\n\nI\t . t\t f.\t I\t I.\t \tt..t`\nI...\n\nL ^A.. t\n\ni\nd\t\n\n.\n\nx\t\n\na\t\n\na =s^%,. _\t\n\n1\n\nw ,\n\nwas of completely retractable type housed in pod mounted blisters (fig. 1).\n\'\t\n\nThis gear does not contribute to the airplane drag during climb and cruise;\n\nL\n\'\t\n\nhowever, the blisters will impose a penalty which was determined in the same\nmanner as for the partially exposed fixed arrangement. The main gear blisters\nfor this gear concept were smaller in size than those for the fixed type, since,\nin that case, the blister width was determined by the gear track. The retre \' ctable gear does not require a nose wheel blister.\n\nFigure 4 presents the drag polars for the airplane with the pod and the\ntwo landing gear arrangements and also, , as a reference, the estimated polar\nfor the basic aircraft. The minimum parasite drag increases incurred by installing the pod were found to be approximately 0.0061 (37%) with the partially\nexposed fixed gear, and 0.0037 (23%) with the retractable gear.\n\nLift-drag ratios, corresponding to the polars of figure 4, are presented\nin figure 5. Compared to the lift-drag ratio for the basic 747 at M & .72,\nthe reductions in maximum L/D because of the pod, amount to approximately 17\npercent with the partially exposed fixed gear, and 11 percent with the retractable gear.\n\nMission Analysis\nThe range capability was evaluated with the externally mounted cargo\npod loaded with a 543 kN (122 000 lbf) bridge launcher. The pod was not pressurized; therefore, the cruise altitude had to be limited to 5.5 km (18 000\nft) since a military specification specifies this as the maximum altitude for\ntransportation of equipment in a non-pressurized environment.\n\nAs the first step in the mission analysis, the airplane drag and available\nthrust at the 5.5 km (18 000 ft) altitude were determined as functions of\nvelocity. The drag was based on the polars of figure 4, and the thrust was\nbased on available P&W JT9D-7 engine data. The results, (fig. 6) show that\nthe drag of either concept was less than the available cruise thrust.\n\nSubsequently, Breguet range factors were calculated as a function of\n8\n\n{\n\n1\t\n\nS.\t\n\n.\n\nr\n^:\t\n\nvelocity for both configurations. These range factors (fig. 7) indicated that\nthe cruise Mach numbers for maximum range were .66 and .68, for the two pod\nconfigurations. It was assumed that no sinificant compressibility drag would\noccur at these Mach numbers since the basic aircraft compressibility effects\nI\n\n\t\n\nwere negligible for Mach numbers less than .72.\n\nA payload-range plot was generated with data from various sources for\nthe Boeing 747-2006 aircraft at long range cruise speed (M = .84). A range\nfactor of 25.61 Mm (13 830 n. mi.) was calculated for the basic aircraft at\nM = .84 and an estimated initial cruise altitude of 9.1 km (30 000 fit). The\nratios of the maximum range factors for each of the two podded configurations\nto that of the basic 747 were then determined. These ratios were .72 for\nthe pod with the fixed, partially exposed, landing gear and .79 for the pod\nwith the retractable gear. Then, the ranges for which the basic airplane\nrequired the same amount of total mission fuel as that available on the podded\nversions were found. These ranges were then multiplied by the Breguet-factor\nratios to obtain the ranges of the aircraft with the pods. Ranges were determined carrying a 543 kN (122 000 lbf) mobile bridge launcher and with the\noriginal landing gear either left in the aircraft (to save conversion time)\nor removed (to save weight). It was assumed that the maximum take-off gross\nweight and fuel capacity for the configurations with the pod remained the\nsame as for the basic aircraft, and that the aircraft with the pods operated\nwith commercial airline fuel reserve requirements. The calculated ranges\nare presented in table III together with the corresponding values for the\nbasic aircraft.,\n\nMating of Pod Onto Carrier Aircraft\nMethods to attach the pod to the Boeing 747 were reviewed briefly. One\nprocedure which appeared feasible employs a pit in the ground with a ramp.\nAfter the pod has been positioned in the pit, the 747 would be moved on top\nof it, supported by the outboard gear on the edges of the pit. The width of\nthe pod exceeds the track of the outboard 747 landing gear and the pit must\nbe shaped with overhanging edges as shown in figure 8. It would be necessary\nto remove or retract the inboard 747 landing gear beforehand, and to temporarily\n9\n\n%r\ny\n\n\t\nF\t\n\nM\n\na\n\nr\n\ninstall a removable gang-plank type of support over the pit for the 747 nose\ngear until the mating is completed and the airplane rests on the pod mounted\ngear. After attachment, the pod with the 747 on top would be towed out of\nthe pit. The overhanging edges would have to end before the beginning of\nthe up-ramp.\nI\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nA study was conducted to determine the feasibility of mounting a detachable\npod to the underside of a Boeing model 747 aircraft to provide a means of\ncarrying outsized cargo in case of a military emergency. The principal results\nof this study were as follows:\n\n1.\n\nFive main attachment points of the pod to the 747 were selected located\nat the 747 nose gear bulkhead; the front and rear spars of the center wing\nbox; the forward main landing gear bulkhead; and the aft main landing gear\nbulkhead.\n\n2.\n\nBecause of the height of the pod, the original 747 landing gear would\nhave to be replaced by a gear mounted on the pod. The pod mounted\ngear either should be retractable or nearly completely enclosed. A\nsimple fully exposed wheel and strut arrangement was found to increase\nthe total airplane/pod drag above the available cruise thrust level.\n\n3.\n\nThe original 747 landing gear could be removed to exchange its weight\nof 144 M J32 300 lbf) for additional fuel if the time required\nfor removal was not prohibitively long.\n\n4.\n\nThe empty weight of the pod was estimated at 199 kN (44 600 lbf) with\nan attached nearly completely enclosed fixed landing gear, and 212 kN\n(47 700 lbf) with a retractable gear.\n\n5. \xe2\x80\x94 The addition of the pod was estimated to increase the basic 747 minimum\nparasite drag by 23 percent for the version with the retractable pod\n10\nI\n4 +\n\n41^\n\np\n\nr\t\n\n}\t\n\n^\t\n\nY\t\n\nj\t\n\n(\t\n\n^^\n\nn\t\n\n!yl ^ L\n\nti\n\nmounted gear, and by 37 percent with the partially exposed fixed gear.\nThe maximum lift to drag ratios for the aircraft with the pod and the\nabove two landing gear configurations were 11 percent and 17 percent,\nrespectivley, below the basic 747 value at low speed.\n\nd.\t\n\nThe range values achievable with a mobile bridge launcher weighing 543\nkN (122 000 lbf) as payload and at a Mach number of approximately .67\nwere from 7.04 Mm (3 800 n. mi.) to 8.70 Mm (4 700 n. mi.) depending on\nthe type of pod mounted landing gear and on whether the original 747\nlanding gear is removed or left in the airplane.\n\n7.\t\n\nThis cursory study did not reveal any aspects which would render the\nabove concept infeasible.\n\nU\n\nI\t .\n\nA\nC:\t\n\nF\n\n{\n\n3\n\nX\n\nI\t\n\nT 1 " I\n\t\n\n!\t\n\nI ^\t\ni\t\n\nt.\n\n\t\n\n3\t\n\n>\t\n\ny\t\n\n.r\nj\t\n\n1 r i_\n\n1..\t\n\nk\n\n^y\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nDepartment of Defense: Military Standardization Handbook, Metallic Mates\nerials and Elements for Aerospace Vehicle Structures, MIL-HDBK-58, 1 September 1971.\n\n2.\n\nOman, B.
