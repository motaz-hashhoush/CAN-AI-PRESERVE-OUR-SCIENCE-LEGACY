b'innovations\nin medicine\n\nHealth care by remote direction, a n\nautomated disease detector, a voicecontrolled wheelchair, a device that\nenables the blind to read almost\nanything in print-these are among a\nwealth of medical spinoffs being\ntransferred from the world of\naerospace to the plcblic.\n\nKa Ka, Hickiwan, Vaya Chin, and Gu Vo sound like\nplaces in Southeast Asia. They are not; they are a\ns\nAmerican a Peoria. Villages of the Papago Indian\ns\nReservation in Arizona, they rank among America\'s\nmost out-of-the-way places. As such they have benefited from a significant demonstration that applies\nspace technology to provide health care to people in\nremote areas.\nThe demonstration has dual purposes. It i s a\ndevelopmental step toward meeting a future space\nrequirement and at the same time it offers the\npotential of professional medical care to isolated\npopulations whose access to regular medical service\nis inadequate or nonexistent.\nNASA is planning now toward the day of longduration flight-manned interplanetary missions for\nexample-wherein routine health care and emergency treatment must be accomplished on-board the\nspacecraft over periods of months or perhaps even\nyears. Since spacecraft design limits crew size, the\nmedical assignment may be handled by a single\nastronaut-physician or by a crew member trained as a\nphysician\'s assistant. In a space emergency demanding surgery, for instance, sophisticated communications equipment, backed by a computerized data\nprocessing system, would make it possible for a\nsurgeon on Earth to "examine" the patient. He could\nstudy X-rays and other data, specify an in-flight\nsurgical procedure, and guide the astronaut-medic\nstep-by-step through the operation.\nAll over the world, millions of .people live in\nareas almost a remote as astronauts in space. These\ns\npeople can benefit enormously from a system that\n\nenables a physician to help patients separated by\ngreat distances from his own physical location.\nSuch a system is being evaluated now. It is called\nSTARPAHC (Space Technology Applied to Rural\nPapago Health Care). NASA technology in space\n.\ncommunications and data processing is being applied to remote health services for the Papago tribe.\nSTARPAHC i s administered by the NASA Life Sciences Directorate in the Office of Space Sciences. It is a\njoint program involving NASA\'s Johnson Space Center, the lndian Health Service of the Department of\nHealth, Education & Welfare, and the Papago\'s Executive Health Council. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.\nis NASA\'s systems support contractor.\n\nThe Mobile Health Unit\'s\nbeat is the sparsely, vegetated, alternately\nflat and mountainous\nterrain of the Sonora Desert.\n\nThe Papago Indian Reservation is truly remote,\nlying in the Sonora Desert, an arid, sparselyvegetated terrain, alternately flat and humped by\nclusters of mountains. Sprinkled over some 4,300\nsquare miles are 75 villages where almost 10,000\npeople live. The principal Papago town of Sells is 70\nmiles from Tucson. Many of the villages are more\nremote, even from Sells, but distance is only part of\nthe travel problem. Although there are some paved\nhighways, many roads are unpaved, slow, and hazardous after heavy rains.\nA key element in servicing the remote areas of\nthe reservation i s the Mobile Health Unit, a large van\ncontaining clinical equipment and the communications gear for contact with STARPAHC\'s base of\noperations, the Indian Hospital at Sells.\n\n7 f T L -\n\nl!.rw4,-\n\n" *\n.\n(\n( I \'In;\n; I\n\n".1\'\n\n9\n\ni:\n\n+\n\n\' . 11\n\n-<\n+\nOperating on a pre-announced schedule, and\nstaffed by a Community Health Medic (CHM) and a\nlaboratory technician, the mobile clinic negotiates\nthe rough roads of the reservation, visiting the villager in turn and handling as many as 27 patients\ndaily.\nIn the van\'s reception room, the CHM interviews\nthe patient a to complaint, symptoms, and other\ns\ndetails. If necessary, the CHM can call up the patient\'s medical history from records stored in Albequerque by punching keys on a data terminal.\n\n.,\nIn the examining room, the CHM conducts the\nexamination under the supervision of a physician at\nSells, who may watch oli nl and converse on the\nradio link. If the physician wants to view a particular\npart of the body, the CHM operates a color TV\ncamera mounted overhead to transmit a close-up\npicture. When biochemical analysis is indicated, the\nlaboratory room can handle a variety of tests and\nsend the results immediately to the doctor a data or\ns\neven a microscopic slides transmitted by TV. The\ns\nmobile clinic can also transmit X-ray pictures.\n\nSupervising physician at Sells\nIndian Hospital can see, talk with\nand figuratively rrtoucb"a patient\nin the Mobile Health Unit miles away.\n\nk\n\n,\n\nA pa&t\'l medical bistory is displayed on\na console instantly wben summoned from\nstored records..\n\'\n\nIn the Mobile Healtb\nUnit, a community\nhealth medic takes an\nelectrocardiogram. T V\ncamera (top), sends\npicture of the patient to\nthe Indian Hospital at\nSells, STARPAHC\'s\nbase of operations. The\nelectrocardiogram is also\nsent to Sells.\n\n,\n\ntogether with a number of displays designed to\nprovide him necessary information. A major feature\nof the console is a control which enables him to\ndirect precisely the movement of the cameras in the\nmobile clinic many miles away. The physician can\nsee, talk with and, in a figurative sense, "touch" the\npatient. With the equipment and information available to him, the physician can make timely diagnosis\nand specify treatment to be carried out by the CHM\nin the mobile van.\nIn addition to the Mobile Health Unit, STARPAHC includes a fixed clinic at Santa Rosa, another\ntown within the reservation perimeter. This clinic,\nwith a CHM, a lab technician, and administrative\npersonnel, operates in the same manner a the\ns\nmobile van, extending examination and treatment\ncapability.\nThe STARPAHC network includes two other\nelements. At Albuquerque, a computer provides access to an established health information data base\noperated by the Department of Health, Education &\nWelfare. At the Indian Health Hospital in Phoenix, a\nstaff of medical specialists can be called upon to\nconsult with physicians at Sells when a unique or\ncomplex situation occurs.\nThe space-derived telecommunications network\nthat makes possible this interchange has its focal\npoint at the Sells Hospital. Atop Quijotoa Mountain,\nnear the center of the reservation, a microwave\n\nmajor element of STARPAHC\'s space-derived\ntelecommunications network is this m\'crowaue\nstation on Quijotoa Mountain, neai-the center of\nthe Papago reservation. The station relays T V ,\nvoice and medical data between tbe Sells hospital,\nthe Mobile Hedtb Unit and a fixed clinic in the\ntown of Santa Rosa.\nstation relays the N and data signals between Sells,\nthe mobile van, and the fixed clinic at Santa Rosa.\nSTARPAHC\'s community acceptance has been\nexceptional. Residents of the outlying villages depend on scheduled visits of the Mobile Health Unit\nand the daily services of the fixed clinic.\nThe system opens up a broad new potential for\nimproving health care. The capability to communicate with remote villages suggests TV instructional\nprograms in areas such a environmental health,\ns\nsanitation, nutrition, and disease control. STARPAHC\'s initial success mikes it likely that remote care\nactivities will be continued upon conclusion of the\ntwo-year evaluation in mid-1977 when the Department of Health, Education & Welfare is expected to\nsponsor follow-on activities.\n\n\'\n\n-\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\n'
