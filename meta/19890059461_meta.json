A conceptual design for the quenchgun launcher is presented, and the integration of the system into a lunar base logistics model for evaluation is addressed. The results of these evaluations under the NASA Office of Exploration lunar base scenarios are reported.", "title": "An electomagnetic lunar launcher utilizing superconductivity technology", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T02:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890059461, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bilby, Curt"}, "organization": {"name": "KDT Industries, Inc.", "location": "Austin, TX, United States"}}, "id": "b30d0738cf434958ae9ba59e90b9cb1e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890059461, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nozette, Stewart"}, "organization": {"name": "Texas, University", "location": "Austin, United States"}}, "id": "6ff351e4f0544e5f9eb5689bfd6e8eaf"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19890059461, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kolm, Henry"}, "organization": {"name": "Electromagnetic Launch Research, Inc.", "location": "Hudson, MA, United States"}}, "id": "b4beade6118949b287842ab5d09e7581"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890059461, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890059461, "id": "eeb05bda25894ed5abfc8ee23dee9a23", "publicationDate": "1989-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
