The basic raw materials are highpurity silica fiber (1 to 10 pm diameter), fumed-silica\npowder, and reagent-grade starch; the silica fiber and\npowder do not devitrify when held for prolonged\nperiods of time at temperatures over 1100\xc2\xb0C.\nOnly the purest materials are used, and care must\nbe taken to avoid contamination during processing;\naccordingly, deionized water and stainless steel or\npolyethylene utensils and mixing vessels are used.\nThe fibers are first washed in dilute hydrochloric acid\nto remove contaminants and then rinsed with deionized water; pure nitrogen is used for agitation of\nslurries.\nThe nature of each lot of fibers governs the details of\nthe process; for example, washing may need to be\nrepeated, less stable fibers are to be fired for a shorter\ntime at a lower temperature, and fiber length may\nhave to be modified because long fibers lead to stratification during molding and cracking of tiles during\nfiring. To obtain finished tiles of a required density,\n\ntrials will have to be made to establish shrinkage\nfactors for each lot of fibers.\nThe binder for 250 to 600 grams of fiber is prepared by suspending 0.5 to 1.0% fumed silica and\n0.025 to 1.0% starch in 1000 to 3000 grams of deionized water containing 1 to 5 ml of 15 M ammonium hydroxide. The binder mixture is homogenized\nin a high-speed mixer, and the dispersion is then\nblended with drained fibers and water in a V-blender\nfor 30 to 60 minutes; pH is held at 9.0 with ammonium hydroxide. An intensifier bar in the V-blender\nis used to break up clumps of fiber. The resulting\nslurry is poured into a mold for either single-direction or multidirection pressing, and rapidly pressed\nat 69 to 138 kN/m2. Final tile density is controlled by\nfiber content and molded dimensions; densities from\n110 to 380 kg/M 3 can be obtained.\nTiles are placed in an oven and the temperature is\nraised at 11\xc2\xb0C per hour to a maximum of 150\xc2\xb0C; the\ntotal drying time is 18 hours. The tiles are taken\ndirectly from the oven and placed in a furnace which\nis free of alkali or alkaline earth oxide impurities. The\ntemperature of the furnace is programmed to reach\n1200\xc2\xb0 to 1300\xc2\xb0 C at a rate of 150\xc2\xb0 C per hour or less\nto avoid cracking of small (15 x 15 x 7.5 cm) tiles;\nhowever, the maximum temperature and the firing\ntime at the high temperature is a function of the\ncharacteristics of the fiber being used. The starch\nburns away at about 530\xc2\xb0 C, leaving a pure silica\nunbonded structure.\nFinal tile properties are related to fiber-to-fiber\nsintering at least as much as fiber-to-binder sintering.\nShrinkage and sintering are more rapid with binder\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Warpage\nmay be a problem; it can be caused during firing by\ntemperature gradients in the tile or by sagging of the\nunsupported tile in the furnace. As a rule, about 0.5\ncm of material is machined off a tile to obtain the\nfinished size.\n\nReference:\nGoldstein, H.
