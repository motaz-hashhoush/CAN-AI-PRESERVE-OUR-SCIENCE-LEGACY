b'Optical Fiber Protection\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\nT\n\nhe NASA Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) Program provided the\nneeded research funds, as well as technology,\nfor the development of a technique to protect\nsensitive strands of optical fiber from harsh environments. This technique has helped fashion products\nuseful in taking strain and temperature measurements, as well as in spotting trace amounts of\nbiological and chemical warfare agents. NASA funds\nand expertise went into helping F&S, Inc., (soon to\nbe named Luna Innovation) of Blacksburg, Virginia,\ndevelop ruggedized coatings and coating technologies\nthat are applied in the making of optical fiber.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements prompted F&S to develop a\nmetal coating capability specifically for space-based\napplications of optical fiber sensors. The unique and\ndemanding performance required from the spacerated optical fiber led to a novel metal coating\ntechnique developed by F&S: on-line sputtering of\nvery thin metal coatings onto optical fiber during\nproduction.\nThe F&S optical fiber fabrication facility and\nvarious coating practices have enabled the company\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements prompted F&S to develop\na novel metal coating technique.\n\n84\n\nIndustrial Productivity/Manufacturing Technology\n\nto make specialty optical fiber with custom designed\nrefractive index profiles and protective or active\ncoatings. The company has demonstrated sputtered\ncoatings using metals and ceramics, and combinations of both. Also, the company has developed ways\nto apply thin coatings of specialized polyimides\nformulated at Langley Research Center. With these\ncapabilities, F&S has produced cost-effective, reliable\ninstrumentation and sensors able to withstand\ntemperatures of up to 800 degrees centigrade. Yet\nanother outcome of its research is the demonstration\nof sapphire fiber-based sensors capable of performing\nat temperatures above 1500 degrees centigrade.\nF&S has adapted the same sensing platforms to\nprovide the rapid detection and identification of\nchemical and biological agents with parts-per-trillion\nsensitivities. More sensitive than devices now used,\nthe firm\xe2\x80\x99s fiber optic \xe2\x80\x9cbiosensor\xe2\x80\x9d also does the job far\nmore quickly.\nF&S is continuing work with NASA through\nadditional contracts with the Dryden Flight Research\nCenter, as well as Langley. The company is developing flight-worthy systems for physical measurements\nthrough Dryden, and work is underway with Langley\nto develop novel materials in microcomposites, high\ndisplacement actuators, and active polymers.\nF&S innovations in self-assembled monolayer\nthin film coatings are being realized. This is a\ncapability with a wide variety of applications.\nLightweight, actuated composite structures, for\ninstance, will allow deployment and surface control\nof large spaceborne and terrestrial optical and\nelectronic receivers. Such equipment could find\napplication for astronomy and communications\npurposes, at a very reduced cost for fabrication,\nmaintenance, and operation.\nF&S has patented optical fiber fabrication\ntechniques, devices, and instrumentation for the\nphysical measurement of strain, temperature, and\npressure, as well as chemical and biological detection,\nexplains Michael Gunther, company vice president\nand co-founder. F&S has also designed and fabricated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)\nproducts. MEMS devices include optical switches,\nmicropumps, and optical interconnects.\nGunther explains that since the company was\nfounded in 1990, worldwide product sales have\ncontinued to grow annually. The firm is dedicated to\nthe transition of basic research to cost-effective\ncommercial products.\n\n'
