This procedure minimizes porosity and thermal cracking of the welded joint.\n\nHow it's done: After striking an arc between the\nconsumable electrode and the workpieces, the temperature and length of the arc are varied by a predetermined program to preheat the weld zone of the workpieces to a substantially molten condition (detail a).\nSufficient metal is then blown out of the weld zone to\nform a deep recess (detail b). The sides of the recess\nare melted (detail c) and a puddle is gradually built up\nwithin the recess (detail d) to form a weld nugget\n(detail e) when the arc is interrupted.\nNotes:\nI. This procedure offers the following additional\nadvantages over standard resistance spot welding\n(continued overleaf)\n\nNOW\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
