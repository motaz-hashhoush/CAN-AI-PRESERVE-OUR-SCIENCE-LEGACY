The MCC Shuttle OFT Data System (OFTDS) shall\n\nprovide facilities for flight control and data systems personnel\n\nto monitor and control the Shuttle flights from launch (tower\n\nIt shall also sup\xc2\xad\nclear) to rollout (wheels stopped on runway).\nport the preparation for flight (flight planning, flight control\xc2\xad\nler and crew training, and integrated vehicle and network testing\n\nThe MCC Shuttle OFTDS shall provide for monitoring\n\nactivities).\nand control of specific payloads assigned to JSC. Emphasis during\n\nOPT shall be on the Shuttle system performance with extensive real\xc2\xad\ntime system monitoring performed in the MCC to assure crew safety,\n\nmission success, and qualification of the Shuttle onboard systems.\n\nAs the Shuttle becomes operational, the MCC support emphasis shall\n\nshift from basic systems monitoring to payload monitoring, data\n\nmanagement, and multiple flight support.\n\nThe MCC Shuttle OFTDS shall also provide support for guidance;\n\ntargeting; communication; trajectory determination, navigation,\n\nmonitoring, and control; Orbiter systems command and monitoring;\n\ninflight payload data acquisition; and information extraction\n\nnecessary for the execution of the above functions.\n\nFigure 3-1 depicts the three major support systems of the OFTDS\n\nand the data types and sources of data entering or exiting the\n\nMCC. These systems are the Communication Interface System (CIS),\n\nthe Data Computation Complex (DCC), and the Display and Control\n\nSystem (DCS). All of these systems may interface with, and share\n\nprocessing facilities with, other applications processing support\xc2\xad\ning current MCC programs. These programs include the 360/75 Com\xc2\xad\nputer Complex, Software Development Lab (SDL), Large Area Crop\n\nInventory Experiment (LACIE), Production Processor System (PPS),\n\nData Retrieval and Formatting Technique (DRAFT), and Medical In\xc2\xad\nformation Computer System (MEDICS).\n\n3.1.1 Purpose of the MCC. The MCC shall provide centralized con\xc2\xad\ntrol of the NASA Space Shuttle OFT from launch through orbital\n\nflight, entry, and landing until the Orbiter comes to a stop on\n\nthe runway.

The DCCU shall control\n\nthe acceptance or rejection of the computer data appearing\n\nat the DTE input interfaces by providing a cluster alloca\xc2\xad\ntion function. This function shall be defined as the\n\ngeneration and issuance of enable (acceptance) or disable\n\n(rejection) control signals from the DCCU to the DTE clus\xc2\xad\nters. Each signal shall govern the response of an associ\xc2\xad\nated IIM to its computer inputs. Cluster allocation shall\n\npermit assignment of single cluster to a single computer\n\nor, if required, assignment of a single cluster to multiple\n\ncomputers. Procedurally, however, those clusters assigned\n\nto a MOC or DSC in a mission environment shall not be shared\n\nby any other computer and shall require protection from\n\nsuch an occurrence; the DCCU shall provide this in the form\n\nof a selectable mode of operation in which any reallocation\n\nor deselection of mission-supporting clusters shall be in\xc2\xad\nhibited.\n\n\nWDL 7321 1/7 \t\n\nPAGE\n\n4-115\n\n\nS\n\nJSC-10013B\n\nFord Aerospace &\nCommunications Corporation\nSpace Information Systems Operation\n\n4.4.2.1.2\n\nDTE Cluster Control Unit (DCCU).\n\n(Cont\'d)\n\nD. \tSelectover Requirements. In a mission environment, a MOC/\n\nDSC pair shall supply DTE display data for the Mission\n\nOperations Control Room (MOCR) and Auxiliary Display Equip\xc2\xad\nment Group (ADEG), respectively, on the mission floor to\n\nwhich the pair is assigned. Since both computers in the\n\npair output identical data, these correlations must be\n\nestablished through cluster allocation by enabling those\n\nconnected to the ADEG to accept only DSC data. To ensure\n\nthe more critical MOCR users a valid data source in the\n\nevent of MOC failure, the DCCU shall provide a selectover\n\nfunction, which when initiated, shall automatically recon\xc2\xad\ndition the MOCR clusters to accept data only from the\n\noriginal DSC, which shall then become the MOC, and con\xc2\xad\nversely, permit the ADEG clusers to accept data only from\n\nthe original MOC, which shall then become the DSC. The\n\nDCCU shall be capable of providing for selectover capability\n\nfrom the SDPC only. The selectover function is further\n\ndefined for the MOC operational configurations as follows.\n\n1. \tSingle Mission Selectover. When conditioned for select\xc2\xad\nover by either of two Restart/Selectover (R/S) modules\n\nin the SDPC control area (CONS), the DCCU shall~perform\n\nthe selectover operation without affecting allocations\n\nto any existing nonmission applications.\n\n2. \tPseudo MOC/DSC Selectover. When supporting nonmission\n\nfunctions not requiring the MOCR/ADEG concept, any de\xc2\xad\nsired dynamic/standby computer pairs (pseudo MOC/DSC)\n\nin the SDPC shall be provided the selectover function\n\nif that function is requested from tle R/S modules.\n\nE. \tRestart Requirements. The nominal procedure following a\n\nselectover due to MOC failure is to designate a new DSC\n\nfrom the R/S modules. This consists of a normal entry\n\nprocedure, which shall cause those clusters allocated to\n\nthe previous DSC to automatically be reassigned to the\n\nnew DSC.\n\n\nWOL 7321 1/77 \t\n\nPAGE\n\n4-116\n\nJSC-10013B\n\n\nFord Aerospace &\nCommunications Corporation\nSpace Information Systems Operation\n\n4.4.2.1.3 Video Switching Matrix Buffer Vultiplexer (VSMBM). The\n\nVSMBM shall accept video switching requests from the DTE and the\n\nDSCIM and shall control the transfer of these requests to both\n\nthe VSM and the AVSM. In addition, the VSMBM shall accept\n\nfunction-oriented TV saturation data inputs from the DTE and pro\xc2\xad\nvide butputs suitable for interface with the Telemetry Event\n\nDrivers (TED\'s) for driving the console-mounted amber or red TV\n\nsaturation indicators, and also for driving LED readouts on the\n\nTV Channel Status Module (TCSM).\n\nA. \tFunctional Requirements.\n-following\n\nThe VSMBM shall satisfy the\n\n\noperational requirements.\n\n\n1. \tThe VSMBM shall provide 10 separate input interfaces.\n\nOne serial interface shall be compatible with DSCIM\n\nrequirements; eight parallel interfaces shall be com\xc2\xad\npatible with the DTE requirements; and one (spare)\n\nshall be a parallel interface.\n\n2. \tThe VSMBM shall provide storage and gating for video\n\nswitching requests from all 10 input interfaces.\n\n3. \tThe VSMBM shall provide four output interfaces includ\xc2\xad\ning the VSM, AVSM, TED, and TCSM.\n\nB. \tVSMBM Input/Output Requirements.
