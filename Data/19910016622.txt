Johnson\nDepartment of Industrial Engineering\nMorgan State University\nBaltimore, MD. 21239\nNASA Colleague: Mr. Bernard Dixon, Code 152, 286-7739\nThe need for a predictive budget/funding model is obvious. The current\nmodels used by the Resource Analysis Office (RAO) are used to predict the total\ncosts of satellite projects. The research conducted this summer was an effort to\nextend the modeling capabilities from total budget analysis to total budget and\nbudget outlays over time analysis.\nA statistical based and data driven methodology was used to derive and develop\nthe model. The budget data for the last 18 GSFC-sponsored satellite projects\nwere analyzed and used to build a funding model which would describe the historical\nspending patterns. This raw data consisted of dollars spent in that specific year\nand their 1989 dollar equivalent. This data was converted to the standard format\nused by the RAO group and placed in a database.\nA simple statistical analysis was performed to calculate the gross statistics\nassociated with project length and project cost and the conditional statistics on\nproject length and project cost.\nThe modeling approach used is derived from_ the theory of embedded statistics\nwhich states that properly analyzed data will produce the underlying generating\nfunction. The process of funding large scale projects over extended periods of\ntime is described by Life Cycle Cost Models(LCCM). The data was analyzed to find\na model in the generic form of a LCCM.\nThe model developed is based on a Weibull function whose parameters are\nfound by both nonlinear optimization and nonlinear regression. In order to use\nthis model it is necessary to transform the problem from a dollar/time space to a\npercentage of total budget/time space. This transformation is equivalent to\nmoving to a probability space. By using the basic rules of probability, the\nvalidity of ;both the optimization (a form of steepest descent) and the regression\n(Gauss-Newton method for minimizing nonlinear residual errors) steps are insured.\nThis statistically significant model is then Integrated and inverted. The resulting\noutput represents a project schedule which relates the amount of money spent to\nthe percentage of project completion.\nthe Implications of these results are obvious. A priori, both a total budget\nand a time series of budget outlays can be produced for any future satellite\nproject. Furthermore there exists a real time tool which can be used to calculate\nboth cost overrun/underrun amounts and overrun/underrun completion times.\nThe theory of embedded statistics also can be used for further analyses.\nThere seems to be a complete set of contract and pricing data and strategies\nwhich need to be looked at. A similar analysis can be done to quantify Information\non which contractors, management styles, scale of projects and funding styles\nlead to cost overruns or underruns.\n3*\n\n'
