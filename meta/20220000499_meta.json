An area of continued, albeit incomplete, study is the interaction of these stressors on microbial populations inherent to   both   astronauts   and   spacecraft   surfaces   and   systems.  A  primary   concern   is   the   potential   for   the   spaceflight environment to perturb the phenotype of these populations towards negative outcomes for crew and craft. In order to effectively mitigate these potential risks, they must first be characterized. We performed a retrospective literature analysis to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the affects of ionizing radiation and elevated CO2  on relevant microbial populations. The results of these retrospectives will guide next steps in the decisions of what (if any) further studies should be pursued and to guide decisions of the need for countermeasures.  \nSTRESSORS\nIonizing radiation. The health risk involved with increased exposure to cosmic radiation has been studied in crew for 35+ years, with human health and cancer risk being the main focus. However, space radiation could also affect both the resident microorganisms aboard the ISS and the normal, healthy astronaut microbiomes that are of direct concern for   crew   health.  A  retrospective   review   of   over   250   publications   was   accomplished   looking   at   the   impact   of cumulative ionizing radiation doses lower than 3 Gy (chronic or acute) on microbial populations. \nElevated CO2. The health risk involved with elevated atmospheric CO2 in spacecraft, primarily focusing on human toxicological   risks,   is   understudied.   The   current   Spaceflight   Maximum   Allowance   Concentration   for   24-hour average   CO2  is   0.4%   (3   mm   Hg),   which   is   significantly   higher   than   terrestrial   levels   (0.04%).   Whether   these elevated   ambient   CO2  levels   aboard   spacecraft   influence   the   diversity   and   phenotypic   responses   of   the   resident microbial communities from both the spacecraft environment (air, surface, water) and crew members (gut, nasal,skin microbiomes) is not known.   A retrospective review was accomplished looking at the impact of chronic CO2 exposure up to 0.7% (5 mm Hg) for up to 6 months and acute exposure up to 2.6% (20 mm Hg) for up to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: MICROBIOME OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT\nThe   microbiome   of   the   built   spacecraft   environment   has   been   sampled   consistently   over   the   course   of   human spaceflight   and   significant   advancements   have   been   made   in   identifying   microbial   populations   on   the   ISS.  The dominant source of microbes on spacecraft surfaces are human-derived. Once in the spacecraft built environment,the extreme environment selects for features that enhance survival. While efforts to understand potential antibiotic resistance   and   pathogenicity   of   ISS   isolates   is   robust,   there   is   little   to   no   understanding   of   which   spaceflight environmental   stressors,   to   include   ionizing   radiation   or   elevated   CO2,   drive   the   evolutionary   trajectory   of spacecraft-associated microbial populations.  \nCONCLUSIONS: MICROBE-HOST INTERACTIONS\nThe host-microbiome field has emerged as an important factor in human health on Earth as well in spaceflight. The field  is struggling with   the   complexity   of   the   system   under   investigation   as   there   is   substantial   taxonomic   and functional heterogeneity in these communities, making it difficult to establish clear stimulus-response dynamics.Taxonomic characterization is the norm; however, the functional role of each community member is key to linking environmental perturbations to potential dysbiosis. For both ionizing radiation and elevated CO2, the likely target of the perturbation is the host tissue, not the microbes themselves.. Any resulting changes to the microbial community composition and/or function is likely a result of adapting to those changes in the host physiology. RECOMMENDATIONS\nEmphasize functional characterization as opposed to taxonomic characterization of microbial communities.Increase the number of investigations using chronic, spaceflight-relevant doses of ionizing radiation. \nMoBE studies should move away from observational studies towards predictive modeling of community dynamics. \nContinue to develop scale-down models, such as tissues-on-a-chip & defined microbial communities. \nFocus on the crew response to elevated CO2 over MoBE considerations. \nAssess how direct contact with the hypercapnic environment affects skin microbiome dynamics. \n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20220000499, "endDate": "2022-02-10T08:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "e53641f275f15469a1b19a8980e09171", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f9d9a055e2d84a86a06ac6586ed2a3c7", "id": "4297550a2e404425a725f3dea7c286e4"}], "name": "2020 NASA Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop", "location": "Online", "id": "f9d9a055e2d84a86a06ac6586ed2a3c7", "url": "https://web.cvent.com/event/cd16f7a7-974e-441a-9378-8875e486b73b/summary", "startDate": "2022-02-07T08:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Broddrick_HRP_IWS_2022.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220000499/downloads/Broddrick_HRP_IWS_2022.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220000499/downloads/Broddrick_HRP_IWS_2022.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220000499/downloads/Broddrick_HRP_IWS_2022.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
