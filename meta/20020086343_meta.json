Among them are METPRO, a meteorological data acquisition and processing system, which has been widely used, RISKPRO, an environmental assessment system, and MAPPRO, a geographic information system. METPRO software is used to collect weather data from satellites, ground-based observation systems and radio weather broadcasts to generate weather maps, enabling potential disaster areas to receive advance warning. GSC's initial work for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center resulted in METPAK, a weather satellite data analysis system. METPAK led to the commercial METPRO system. The company also provides data to other government agencies, U.S. embassies and foreign countries.", "title": "Weather Information Processing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:27:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086343, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086343, "isbn": "0-16-035821-3", "id": "5cdf9d88fcee4b968ae9036b40426fb0", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1991", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086343.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086343/downloads/20020086343.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086343/downloads/20020086343.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086343/downloads/20020086343.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
