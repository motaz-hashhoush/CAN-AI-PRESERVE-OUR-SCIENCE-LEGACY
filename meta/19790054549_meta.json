The discussion includes a thorough specification of the atomic and molecular input data used in the calculations that could be useful to others working in the field. The results show that the use of spectrally averaged cross sections for diatomic absorbers such as CO and C2 in the boundary layer can lead to an underestimation (by as much as 29%) of the spectral flux at the stagnation point. On the other hand, for the turbulent region near the cone frustum on the probe, the flow tends to be optically thin, and the spectrally averaged results commonly used in coupled radiative transport-flow field calculations are in good agreement with the present line-by-line results. It is recommended that these results be taken into account in sizing the final thickness of the Galileo's heat shield.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790054549, "endDate": "1979-06-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics"}}, "meetingId": "70a8a06836374baba73676e5c23be6c9", "id": "4bd82ff93f90477a93ca0f3a6c0c23dc"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "70a8a06836374baba73676e5c23be6c9", "id": "55d3bf4f8fec4537b645f0e2b79ce812"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Thermophysics Conference", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "70a8a06836374baba73676e5c23be6c9", "startDate": "1979-06-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790054549, "id": "c0baf6f8441542e2931e8d6b84e8d665", "publicationDate": "1979-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
