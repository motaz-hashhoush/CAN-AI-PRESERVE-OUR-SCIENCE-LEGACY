Zade\'~of the University of California at\nBerkeley.\nset\nambiguous\nThe theory of f i zziness deals with i~ with\nboundary instead of a1 ordinary set. In the conventional\nBoolean set com~rising"0" and "*,"\nt.,e b~undaryof\nan individual set can be cf:a*ly \'is inguished, but the\nfuzzy set i s characterized by the \'1 t that t\'ie boundary\nbetween the inside and outside of th. set i s not obvious.\nThe fuzzy control is based on the fuzzy set t\' eory which\nwas developed for c\'etermining the quantitl of subjective\nfuzziness of human being and for mL.\'ng ob: -tive evduetion of the * 12-iness possible, a ~ d\nthereby eD\'n.:nating\nfuzzy portions a m ch\'as poss:ble.\ns\nIn the conventio ial automatic\n\' opcrdtion s)s*en,\ntrain operation is performed \' y a c>n.rol based or I 3\nControl (Pro?onional Integra. d and Differential Contro\')\ns that target speed pattern ,.r\no\ntermined for each operating section can be follow\nI I this conventional au-omatic train operation, accur re operation can be achieved\nin a manner of following the predetermined speed pattern.\nHowever, in actual practice. there are many kinds of\nchanges of running condi ions such a gradient etc. of\ns\n\n.\n\ntrack and the braking force of rolling stock. Therefore,\nto follow the target speed, i t i s necessary to send ntrrl\ncommands frequently for acceleration and brake app1i.dtion. As a result, smooth operation is apt to become difficult, and riding comfort i s likely to be degraded. More.\nover, an accuracy of train stopping at predetermined locations of stations cannot be determined through the logic\nof the control system. Accordingly dispersion should be\nchecked by computer simulation o r tests using real cars.\nThis kind of problem occurs because \'he train o~eration\ncharacteristics as a controlle 1 system are not well adapted\nto i t s coitrol system. The characteristics of running train\nvary complicatedly and non-linearly in response to changes\nin the evternal situation. In the conventional control\nmethod, complicated controlled systems, wen dealt with\napproximating then to Sim~ltlinear models, and only\nthe follow-up to predete mined s,~eedpattern was taken\ninto account in the evaluatior related to control.

Zadeh, who first developed the\nconcept of fuzzy reasoning in the mid196CS.\nMr. Zadeh i s currently a Professor\nof Computer Science in the Electrical\nEngineering and Computer Science depar:ment at tne University of Califorma at Berkeley.\nA h\'issan spokesmah said engineers\nare still developing the brake and\ntransmissions systems, and no intre\nduction dates have been set. Nissan\nhas developed a fuzzy logic program\nand is now looking to see if it can be\napplied to its patented transmission\nand brake systenl designs* he\nplained. F u y logic p.ogramming, accordng to the company, would enhance brake and transmission system\nperformance with improved control\nflexibility.\nh\'issan is developing an automatic\ntansmission in u9hichfuzzy logic computer programming is used to electronicaliy sMt gears in a manner similar\nto a drive: who weighs ddferenl factors to rnznually shift gears.\n\nWITH A CONVENTION.4L automatic\nZansmissioc, elec3onic sensors detect\nveh.~cie\nspeed and throttle opening, and\nare s u t e d based on the predetermined value of these factors. According to Kissan, this type of system\nis incapable of always providing satisfactov control performance to a driver because it provides a t most only\nabout three ckf!erent shift patterns.\nBut the Nissan fuzzy control transmission, (paten1 number 4,841,815), is\nmore flexible and provides a dnver\nwith more control performance because it is operated by sensors that\nassign values to numerous variables,\nincluding vehicle speed, throttle opening, acceieration and the rate of\nchange of the throttle opening.

As in the\ntransmission, certain signals in the\nbrake system are assigned weighted\nvalues that determine the frequency of\nABS brake actuation.\nIn a paper entitled "AiaWng Compute n Think Like People," hit. Zadeh explained that fuzzy logic allows compute n to handle such imprecise human\nconcepts as "small," "big," "young"\nand "old" by describing them in ranges of numbers instead of exact terms.\nDEVELOP~XENT FUZZY logic in\nOF\nthe early 1950s by Ebrahim Mamdani,\na control engineer at Queen Mary College in London, an2 Seto ksilian, Alr.\nMamdani\'s student at that time, has\nled to growing interest in the use of\nthis theory in such applications as industnal process control and autome\n\n. -.-. ...- --. .\n\n.*.--\n\nbile engine control, said Mr. Zadeh.\nJapan in articular has sholvn a\ngreat deal o interest in fuzzy logic.\nResearch is being c tducted in Japan\nin the application crf this system in\nsuch areas as \\*rh:<e control at the\nTokyo Institute of Technology\'s Sugeno\nLaboratoq, and robot control at Hosei\nUniversity\'s -Hirota Laborator?..\nIn March,;3apanVsMinistry o Inter!\nnational Tfa\'de and Industry e s u b\nlished the Laboratory for Internationhl\nFuzzy Engineering Research (LIFE;.\na group that consists of 46. member\nJapanese firms, including Nusan.\nA fuzzy system developed by Hi&chi, also a member of the new LIFE\norganization, is alread used to controi\nsubwar trains in Sanlai, Japan.\nFuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the m):er of Subaru cars. is developing i.\n:.\nadvanced form of electronic continu\n.ously variable transmission, called :hc.\nECL\'T-11, that also uses f ~ ! :\ncontro:c\nThe ECVT-I1 is not in production no::\nand is not evpected to appear in a:\nautomobile before model Y e r 1991. 5 c cording to a spokesman at Subam\nAmerica, C h e q W.
