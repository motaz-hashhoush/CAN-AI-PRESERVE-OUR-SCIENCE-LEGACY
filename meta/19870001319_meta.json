A total of 136 static and simulated flight acoustic test points were conducted with 9 scale model nozzles. Also, aerodynamic measurements of four selected plumes were made with a laser velocimeter. The presence of the 180 deg shield produced different mixing characteristics on the shield side compared to the unshield side because of the reduced mixing with ambient air on the shielded side. This resulted in a stretching of the jet, yielding a higher peak mean velocity up to a length of 10 equivalent diameters from the nozzle exit. The 180 deg shield in community orientation around the suppressed coannular plug nozzle yielded acoustic benefit at all observer angles for a simulated takeoff. While the effect of shield-to-outer stream velocity ratio was small at angles up to 120 deg, beyond this angle significant acoustic benefit was realized with a shield-to-outer stream velocity ratio of 0.64.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870001319, "publisher": "NASA", "id": "6048b4dcc04d4a28a3ec3a80e3b7109f", "publicationDate": "1985-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870001319.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870001319/downloads/19870001319.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870001319/downloads/19870001319.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870001319/downloads/19870001319.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
