Components and methods expected to be cost effective over a 20 year span were studied. Emphasis was placed on the utilization of natural heating and cooling characteristics. Orientation and location of windows, landscaping, natural ventilation, and characteristics of the local climate and microclimate were intended to be used to best advantage. Energy conserving homes are most efficient when design for specific sites, therefore project TECH should not be considered a prototype design suitable for all locations. However, it does provide ideas and analytical methods which can be applied to some degree in all housing.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760006507, "id": "b881df9065024c3680656fb65a0e99be", "publicationDate": "1974-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760006507.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760006507/downloads/19760006507.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760006507/downloads/19760006507.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760006507/downloads/19760006507.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
