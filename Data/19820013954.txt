A convergence (or divergence) line then forms along a line exactly\ndownwind of the major bend in the coastline. All this is consistent with the structure of the cloud\npatterns seen in a high re3olution Landsat picture of the cloud streets and the major features are\nsimulated well with a boundary layer model. The dominant convergence line is marked by notably\nlarger clouds. To its east the convective roll clouds grow downstream in accord with the deepening\ni\n\nof the boundary layer. To its west (i.e., coastal side) where the induced pressure field forces a\nstrong westerly component in the boundary layer, the wind shear across the inversion gives rise to\nKelvin-Helmholtz waves and billow clouds whose orientation is perpendicular to the shear vector\nand to the major convergence line, It is also suggested that the induced mesoscale circulation will\nfeedback on the ocean by intensifying the wind-generated ocean wave growth and altering their\norientation. We postulate that coastal cyclogenesis is due in large part not only to the fluxes of\nheat and moisture from the ocean, as has been proposed by many authors, but particularly to the\ndifferential heating and moistening of the boundary layer air when the air trajectories pass over\na well defined pattern of SST. With east to northeasterly winds, Cape Hatteras lies downstream\nof the Gulf Stream core, thereby providing a possible explanation for the notably high frequency\nof cyclogenesis in that region.\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\ni\n\ns\nt^\n\ni\n\ndra.\t\n\n`\n\n1z r\n\nW\n\n\xe2\x80\x94, sa-raes)u f,)f "\'41\n^ its\n\nCOAST-OCEAN-ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN MESOSCALE INTERACTION\n1.\n\nIntroduction\nIn the accompanying article In this issue Chou and Atlas (1982), hereafter referred to as I,\n\ndiscuss a satellite-based method of deducing the sensible and latent heating of the atmosphere by\nthe fluxes from the ocean during cold air outbreaks. In that study we used imagery from both\nTI ROS-N and GOES to observe the au-called "cloud free path" or CFP, the structure and orientation of the cloud streets, and the sea surface temperature (SST) between shore and the cloud edge,\nIn order to deduce the rate of deepening of the convective boundary layer downstream along the\nflow, we attempted to use the IR cloud top temperatures observed by the TIROS-N Advanced\nVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). We found this to be impossible because most of the\nclouds near the line of initial cloud formation did not fill the 1 x 1 km field of view of the radiometer. However, we were fortunate to find that Landsat-3 with its 80 m resolution passed over the\narea of interest off the coast of New Jersey on the day of our study. The accompanying picture,\nFig. 1, having dimensions of 180 x 340 km is a composite of two Landsat frames. The purposes\nof this paper are to interpret the Landsat cloud picture in terms oi the atmospheri, processes to\nl\ndemonstrate that these mesoscale processes resulted from d\':ferential heating of the cold land air\nover the ocean due in large part to the shape of the coast, and finally to show that the induced\nmesoscale circulation feeds back to affect the ocean. We also make some speculative conclusions\nconcerning cyclogenesis.\n2.\n\nCloud Interpretation and Postulates\nIn addition to showing the primary features seen in the AVHRR photo in Fig. 10 of II\n\nnamely the main cloud streets oriented N-S in agreement with the surface winds (see Fig. I 1 of I1)\nand cloud dimensions increasing downwind, consistent with the increasing depth of the mixed\nlayer, Fig. 1 shows two other remarkable features which were not clearly discernable in the lower\n\nThe figures in Chou and Atlas (1982) related to this study are reproduced in the Appendix for ease of access.\n\n1\t\n\ni\ni\n\n? * F8\n\nresolution TIROS-N imagery. These are: (1) the line of distinctly larger clouds, indicated as the\ncurve AB and (2) clouds to the left of the latter curve are distinctly smaller than those to its right\nand are aligned in a general E-W direction as opposed to the N-S direction on the right, Our purpose\nis to show that these features are due to the establishment of a mesoscale circulation, and indeed,\nthat tine cloud line AB is a mesoscale front across which the low level winds shift sharply. We shall\ndemonstrate how this mesoscale circulation is established and postulate some broader implications.\nWe suggest\n\nthat the mesoscale circulation comes about in the following way. On this day\n\n(February 17, 1979) the wind coming off the shore is generally out of the north and is essentially\nconstant in direction along the entire coast of Long Island and New Jersey. The wind speed is also\nvirtually constant at 10 ms -1 over the region as seen at both the shore stations and the buoy about\n75 km off the Long Island shore in Fig. 11 of I 1 . The wind speed at the buoy actually increases\nto a peak of about 12.5 ms-1 at about 0500 EST, but then subsides again (sec Fig. 2). However\nits direction remains 350\xc2\xb0 t 10\xc2\xb0 all clay long. The temperature of the surface air on departing the\nLong Island and New Jersey coasts is also essentially the same; i.e., -16 to -14.4\xc2\xb0C. The major\ndifference in the air on either side of the postulated convergence line AB is thus due to the difference in the path length of overwater travel and the mean temperature of the underlying water\nsurface (see Fig. 3 and the SST map of Fig. 12 in I 1 ). To the west of the convergence line, the air\nalong any latitude has had both a shorter path over water and a colder path averaged SST than the\ncorresponding points to the east of the line.\nThe result is that the line AB represents a boundary between warmer air to tine east with a\nrelatively deep boundary layer and reduced surface pressures, and tine colder air to the west with a\nshallow boundary layer and relatively high surface pressures. The oifferences in air temperature,\nboundary layer height, and surface pressure in an E-W direction across the line AB are such as to\ncause the low level winds to its west to accelerate to th, Past, in the manner of a sea breeze front.\nThis is almost certainly the cause of the striking line of convergence and larger cloud elements\nwhich comprise the line AB.\n2\n\nr\n\nTo the cast of the \'front\', the clouds are clearly of a convective nature and continue to grow\nin horizontal dimension downstream, presumably in some proportion to the increasing depth of the\nboundary layer. Also in the eastern region, the cloud streets are oriented almost identically with\nthe wind direction because of the very large heating rates there and the correspondingly large\nvertical momentum exchange, which precludes the existence of significant vertical slicar.\nTo the west of the front, however, the clouds are not only smaller and oriented differently,\nbut they are wavelike in character and show little evidence of changing wavelength in the N-S\ndirection. It seems likely that the clouds in the western region are the result of Kc!vin-llclmholtz\nwaves whose orientation is perpendicular to the shear vector between the velocity of the mixed\nqir in the shallow boundary layer (i.e., with a WNW component) and the strong NNW now above.\nSuch a shear vector would tend to ]lave a N-S direction and thus give rise to the }-W cloud orientation. While, we have no ocean surface wind data to the west of the convergence line to confirm\nthese explanations, and indeed very little to the east, we believe that the combination of the model\nresults discussed below and the Landsat picture itself provide persuasive evidence in their support.\n3.\t\n\nModel Results\nIn order to test the above hypotheses, we have used Stage and Businger\'s (1981 a, b) mixed\n\nlayer model to compute the boundary layer height (Z B ), surface air temperature (To ), and surface\nPressure (Po ) fields. The Stage and Businger model is a Lagrangian model. Assuming a steady state\nsituation as qualified below, we are able to obtain the parameters Z B , To , and Po as function of the\ndownwind distance; Le., along a straight line running N-S parallel to the `fro g *\' AB. Computations\nwere made along 10 such parallel trajectories on both sides of the `front\', thus allowing the construction of maps of Z B , TO , and Po . The initial temperature and humidity soundings at the New\nJersey and the Long Island shores are assumed to be the same and are identical to those at JFK\nInternational Airport, New York at 1100 GMT 17 February 1979. The mean mixed layer wind\nspeed is assumed to be 10 ms 1 with the wind blowing from the north and nearly perpendicular to\n\nthe Long Island shoreline. The divergence is taken to be 1.5 x 10 -5 sec7 1 . The sea surface temperature (SST) adapted is shown in rig. 3 and is taken from the weekly mean SST (Fig. 12 of I 1 ). The\ncurve A13 in Fig. 3 corresponds to the line of distinctly larger clouds in Fig. 1. It can be seen from\nFig. 3 that the northerly air flow is generally across the SST isotherms in the region Oust of the\ncurve AB, while the air flow is more nearly parallel to the SST isotherms to the west of AB. For tale\npurpose of the present study we assume a steady state although it will become evident that the\nsurface licating alters the initial meteorological fields, thus invalidating our assumption. Although\nthe use of a time-dependent model would have been preferable, it seems clear that our basic findings\nwould not have been altered in any major way.\nFig. 4 shows the map of the boundary layer height, surface air temperature and surface pressure generated from the Stage and Businger mixed layer model. Since it turns out that the Z B and\nT. contours are essentially concentric with the isobars, only the latter are shown in 1 mb steps.\nHowever, the corresponding values of Z B and To are also labeled in Fig. 4. In estimating the surface\npressure, it is assumed that the pressure-height relationship above the boundary layer is the same as\nthat of the initial sounding. Therefore, the pressure at the boundary layer top (P B ) can be obtained\nfrom tills relationship and the computed Z B . The surface pressure (P o ) can then be estimated by\nintegrating the hydrostatic equation from the boundary layer top (PB ) to the sea surface using the\ncomputed temperature and water vapor mixing ratio. The dashed curves in Fig. 4 indicate the\nsynoptic scale pressure pattern, which is taken from the surface weather map of Fig. 1 1 of I 1 less\n4 mb. The reason for adjusting the synoptic scale pressure field is that the surface pressure of the\ninitial sounding at the shore is about 1036 nib (I 100 GMT) instead of 1040 mb (1500 GMT) as\nindicated in the weather map. It can be seen from Fig. 4 that the mesoscale and the synoptic scale\npressure patterns are in general agreement, except that the mesoscale field gives more detailed\ninformation around the curve AB. Also, the mesoscale N-S pressure gradient is in good agreement\nwith that derived from the shore station at Islip, Long Island and the buoy about 75 km south\n(see Fig. 11 of I 1 ). This amounts to 2.7 x 10-2 mb km-1 as compared with 2.4 x 10 -2 nib km 1 in\n\n4\n\n^t k3a c^ C\xc2\xb0GX ii\t\n\n.\n\ni\'^L\'^bi ^\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.r%,\n\nour calculations. Note that the model generated surface air temperatum at the buoy is also in good\nagreement with the observation, which Is about \xe2\x80\x94120 for the period 1200. 1600 GMT.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 4 that the contours of P o , ZB , and To virtually follow the configuration of Ilic shoreline near the coasts of New Jersey and bong Island. Due to Modification from the\nsea surface, however, the isopleths gradually change downstream to follow the SST isotherms,\nespecially near the lower right corner of Fig. 4. This change occurs mainly oil\n\n\t western side of\n\nthe `front\' because the isobaric pattern is generally parallel to the SST isotherms in the region cast\nof the curve AB. Note that, at each isobar, the SST and the overwater paths are about the same\nfor all the N-S trajectories to the cast of the curve AB. This results in a simple situation there;\ni.e., the boundary layer is warming and growing (the surface pressure is dropping) downstream\n(southward) and the E-W pressure gradient is nearly negligible as compared to that on the western\n\nside.\nOn the other hand, the situation to the west of the curve AB is quite different. There, the air\nflow is more nearly parallel to the SST isotherms (which tend to parallel the coast) with the SST\nincreasing eastward. More importantly, the overwater paths from shore also increase eastward.\nTherefore, the boundary layer height and the surface air temperature increase and the surface\npressure decreases downstream and eastward to the curve AB.\nIt is strikingly clear from Fig. 4 that the differential heating over the ocean has given rise to\nthe development of a strong mesoscale circulation and that the curve AB does indeed represent a\nfront as originally postulated. We. emphasize tha: the resulting pattern would remain essentially\nunchanged if we were to use a different boundary layer model. Only the gradients of To , ZB , and\nPo would be altered.\nWith regard to the resulting effects oil\n\n\t winds in the boundary layer, these may be deduced\n\nreasonably by neglecting the Coriolis force on this scale. We see then that to the east of the front,\n\n5\n\nthe winds would be accelerated down the pressure gradient and thus to the south. This is consistent\nwith the orientation of the cloud streets, On the other hand, the strong west-east pressure gradient\non the western side of the front would produce a westerly wind component there (discussed further\nbelow) thus giving rise to strong convergence at the front and the larger convective elements along\nthe front which were responsible for our original suspicions.\nIt is now apparent that the induced changes in the wind speed and directions raise doubts\nabout the original assumptions of steady state and unidirectional winds with which we started.\nThus, it would have been desirable to use a 3-D time-dependent mesoscale model. However, we\nbelieve that our simple approach has in fact explained the dominant features. An interesting point\nis that the enhanced mesoscale pressure gradients on both sides of the front will not only accelerate\nthe winds but also give rise to increased ocean-air heat fluxes. These, in turn, should further enhance\nthe pressure gradients and winds in a positive feedback loop. Ultimately, of course, the boundary \t\nlayer air temperature would approach that of the sea thus stopping further development. Some\nindirect evidence of such effects is seen in the wind speed trace at the buoy shown in rig. 2. During\nthe morning hours, after the temperature at the shore has reached its minimum value, the subsequent\noceanic heating would be at a maximum. This would thus enhance the N-S pressure gradient and\naccelerate the winds. This is in fact what happened with a maximum in wind speed at 0500 EST\nafter which the winds decreased once more.\nBy the way, the fact that the winds at the buoy did not alter direction during the day supports\nthe assumption that Coriolis effects were negligible on these time and space scales. Of course, this\ncould also reflect a balance between Coriolis deflection and a synoptic temporal variation.\nIn order to make a more quantitative estimate of the winds in the boundary layer to the west\nof the front, we have made an approximation to the solution. By neglecting the Coriolis force,\nthe vertically averaged equation of motion may be written as (Lavoie, 1972)\n\n6\n\n1\n\ncop\n\ndU/dt = -p\'1 Wax-CD U(U2+V2)\'\xc2\xb0a/(Zh-h)\t\n\n(1)\n\ndV/dt - -p- 1 a p / a y - Cr) V (U2 + V~)V2RZ 1 dh)\t\n\n(b)\n\nwhere (x,y) is the traditional Cartesian coordinate system with the origin fixed at the Delaware\ncoast, i.e., about (38.5 0 N, 75\xc2\xb0W), t time, U and V the x and y components of the mean boundary\nlayer velocity, respectively, p density, p pressure, C D drag coefficient, and Z B and h the heights of\nthe mixed layer and the surface boundary layers, respectively. The value of h is generally much\nsmaller than that of Zh . In the Stage and Businger mixed layer model, h is assumed to be negligible\nas compared to Z B , but the effects of the unstable surface boundary layer (superadiabatic temperature profile) on the mixed layer growth are Included through the parameterizations of the fluxes\nof momentum, heat and moisture at the air-sea interface, Note that the values of Z h and li arc not\nneeded for the following analysis, If we assume dV/dt = 0 and dU/dt U a U/ ax, then (1) and (?)\ncan be combined into\nU a U/ ax = -p\' 1 a p/ ax + p\n\n-1\n\nap/ ay (U/ V)\n\n\t\n(3)\n\nFor the region around 38.5\xc2\xb0N (y = 0) and between the Delaware coast and the curve AB, the x and\ny components of the mean surface pressure gradients are about 4.5 x 10-2 and 2.5 x 10-2 nib kin-\' ,\nrespectively. If V = -10 in 1 (uniform northerly wind), then (3) implies that the mesoscale pressure pattern can generate a westward wind component of about 9 ms -1 at x = 60 km with U = 0\nnear the shore (x = 0) and U = 18 ms-1 near the niesoscaie front along AB (x = 120 kin). The\ninduced westerly wind component is therefore significant, again demonstrating the curve AB to be\na convergence line similar to a sea breeze front.\n4. The Cloud Streets\n\nr\n\nWe now discuss the nature of the cloud streets on either side of the front in the light of the\nmodel results. The mean flow pattern of the boundary layer in the region west of the curve AB\n\n7\n^I\n(\n\ns\n\nmay be deduced from the above analysis. Combining the gever t northerly flaw with the westerly\nflow induced by the mesoseale pressure pattern, the flow patte \xe2\x96\xba n tends to have a northerly wind\ninitially (near the shore) and gradually turning into WNW flow when approaching the curve AB,\nAssuming a 300 in depth for the Inversion\n\nIP;, er\n\nand adoptint; the model calculated boundary layer\nA\n\nheight, the wind at the top of the inversion layer (V j ,) taken from the wind profiles at JFK International Airport, New York and Wallops Island, Virginia is about 22 n \xe2\x96\xbas" I with NNW flow. This\nwind, VP and that deduced in the boundary layer flow,\nVZ ,\n\nsuggest a N-S vertical wind shear,\n\nVII ,\n\nacross the inversion layer as shown in Fig. S. This wind shear would trigger Kelvin-11chnholtz\n\n(K-H) instabilities in the inversion layer to produce billow clouds at the wave crests with the cloud\naxes perpendicular to the xind shear vector (Brown, 1980), i.e., essentially normal to the front\nas observed.\nKelvin-1Ielmlioltz instability is a form of dynamic instability which occurs within a hydrostatically stable layer with strong vertical shear in the velocity profile. A necessary condition for tI \xe2\x96\xbae\noccurrence of K-11 instability is that the local gradient Richardson number should be less than 0.25\n(Miles and I\xc2\xb0Ioward, 1964). For the most unstable wave, the relationship between the wavelength\n(X) and the thickness of the dynamically unstable shear layer (AZ) sulgestcd by Miles and Howard\n( 1964) Woods 0 969) is A = 7.5 A Z and that by Scorer (1969) is A W 41rA Z.\nand\nFigs. 6 and 7 show the roll wavelength (A) and the aspect ratio\n\n(\'A/Z,3 )\n\nversus the distance\n\ndownwind from the Long Island shore for the regions about 30 km cast and west of the curve AB,\nrespectively. The wavelength is visually estimated from the Landsat picture and the boundary layer\n1}cight is taken from the model results. In the eastern region, the wavelength is about 3 . 10 kin\nand the aspect ratio is about 3-7. These are in good agreement with the findings of Kuettner ( 197 1)\nand LeMone (1973). Both the wavelength and the aspect ratio increase downstream with larger\nincreases beyond 150 km of over water travel. This result, together with the fact that the cloud\nstreet orientation is essentially parallel to the mean wind in the boundary layer suggests that\n\n8\n\n.\t\n\nnY\n\n^.^r ^cwlte i^.3 C-3.x"2 &zl..\'\n\nthe cloud streets to the cast of the front are convective roll clouds in the boundary layer, which\nare; caused by convective Instability and the Inflectional point instability as discussed by Kuettner\n(1971), Brown (1970, 1970, LeMone (1973), billy (1966), and others,\nIn the western region, on the other hand, the wavelength and the aspect ratio are virtually\nindependent of fetch and are about 3 km and 3, respectively. Moreover, the wavelength appears\nto be independent of boundary layer height. This is also in agreement with the K-1I instability\ntheory that the most unstable wavelength Is related to the thickness of the dynamically unstable\nshear layer (i,e,, the inversion) and not to the boundary layer beneath it. The thicknur s of the\nInversion layer estimated from the aforementioned A \xe2\x80\x94 A Z relations is in the range of 240 to 400 in\nif X = 3 km, a not unreasonable result. Therefore, the cloud streets in tiie west are almost certainly\n"billow clouds" in the PBL capping inve.-Mon, which are due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.\nAssunun g this to be correct, the orientation of the wave clouds and a knowledge of the winds above\nthe inversion obviously provides information about the vector velocity of the winds in the boundary\nlayer, In the present case, of course, we have deduced those winds from the model results, but\nthey could have been estimated in the above described manner.\n5. Impact on Ocean Waves\nAt least one other significant result may be deduced from the present findings. This elates\nto the feedback of the induced mesoscale circulat ,n on the generation of ocean waves. Our associates at the Instrument Systems Division of this Venter have been flying a sophisticated surface\ncontour radar system to detect, measure, and display the structure and amplitude of ocean waves\nwith a vertical resolution of 15 cm. The data from a swath some 500 m wide and 4 to 5 km in\nlength is summarized In a two-dimensional Fourier ,vialysis of the directional ocean wave spectra,\nSuccessive spectra for each segrhent along the flight path document the downwind evolution of the\nwaves (Kenney, et al., 1979).\n\n9\n\nIn order to study the development of fetch-limited waves, they have been flying oil\n\n\t of\n\ncold air outbreaks when the winds are strong and unidirectional In the hope of finding \xe2\x96\xba, tite simplest\npossible wave structure and determine the growth of wave amplitude and enemy. Walsh\' reports\n\nthat even ill these supposedly simple situations, in addition to the expected wave orientation\nperpendicular to the wind direction, there appears a mysterious secondary peak at another direction\nat distances of sonic 100 kill off shore.\nWe suggest that the occurrence of such bimodal directional wave spectra oil\n\n\t when the\n\nsynoptic scale surface flow is unidirectional may be attributable to tite inesoscale windfield induced\nin the manner previously described. In the case shown, we have deduced the development of strong\nnorth westerly surface winds to the west of the mesoscale front in addition to the enhancement of\nthe basic northerly flow to the cast of that front. The waves generated by each of these winds will\nobviously travel across the frontal position so that in sonic swath of pm.wntiy unknown dimensions\ncentered along the front, one will find both wave directions in the spectra. In the case shown in\nFig. 4, we expf;ct the dominant waves to be oriented essentially E-W to the cast of the front and to\nreach their peak amplitude along the front where the N-S fetch is bounded. Oil\n\n\t south and west\n\nside of the front tl^e latter waves will decay with distance from the fro \xe2\x80\xa2,nt. Similarly, the NE SW\noriented waves generated by the induced north westerly winds to the west of the front will reach\ntheir peak amplitude at the front and decay with increasing distance to its east, The result is that\nthe front represents the locus along which one will find both wave directions at their peak amplitude.\nUnfortunately, Walsl1 2 did not fly in a situation identical to the present one, nor does lie have\nsufficient data to verify the above explanation. Thus, while this explanation secins entirely\nreasonable, it must be considered as a hypothesis to be tested in future flights. At the time of this\nwriting Walsh" (private communication) believes that the second peak in his directional wave spectrunn is due to swell and not to the process described here.\n2 NIvate communication from Dr. Edward Walsh of NASA /G oddard Space Flight Center, Instrument Systems\nDivision.\n\nfi.\n\nG.\t\n\nImplications for C\'yclogenesis\nIt takes no stretch of the Imagination to suggest that the mechanism proposed here for the\n\ninitiation of mesoscale circulations is somehow relate d to coastal cyclogenesis which is a climatoa\nlogical feature of the region near Cape Hatteras. Indeed, the now famous Presidents\' Day C\'yclon\'\nof February 18 . 19, 1979, which deposited record snowfalls along the middle Atlantic states,\ndeveloped the day after th.; case we have discussed here. In an extensive study of that storm\nBosart ( 198 1) notes that\n"a region of enhanced lower tropospheric baroclinielty develops along the Carolina\ncoastal strip In response to significant oceanic sensible and latent heat fluxes which\nwarm, 1110lSten and destabilize the boundary layer. C\'yclogenesis Is initiated along\nthe coastal front as a result of lower tropospheric warm advection,"\nRecently, R. Atlas and R. Rosenberg3 conducted numerical experiments to isolate the critical\nfactors involved in the explosive development of the Presidents\' Day Cyclone. The rapid intensification was correctly predicted with the CILAS 3 model operating in its standard mode. however, the\nmodel failed to predict cyclogenesis when the surface heat and moisture fluxes were curt off\', thus\ndemonstrating the crucial role of diabatic heating resulting from the oceanic fluxes. Of course,\nother large scale factors must also be favorable.\nIn our previous discussion we have emphasized the effects of the shape of the coast during\noff shore cold outflows, however, by 1300 GMT on February 18 the winds at all coastal stations\nin the Carolinas south of Cape Hatteras were directed on shore. The prior history of these air\nparcels showed that they left the New England coast with a northwesterly flow turning anticyclonically to approach the Carolinas from the east. Such a trajectory would have caused the boundary\nlayer air to have been warmed and moistened throughout most of its oceanic passage. The air\nwhich would have been warmed the most is that which passed over the core of the Gulf\' Stream\n\n3 R. Atlas and R. Rosenberg, NASA Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheric Sciences (GL AS), private communication.\n\nr\n\nbefore reaching the shore. By analogy to our previous model results one can then visualize the\ntemperature and height of the boundary layer rising, and the pressure falling with distance south\nof Cape Iatteras on February 18, thus producing the Inverted trough in the pressure pattern\n(Bosart, 1981) which subsequently evolved into the coastal low. Incidentally, Sanders and Cyakum\n(1950) have previously suggested that the explosive development of coastal cyclones occurs\npreferentially near the strongest gradients of SST. This is not what we propose.\nIn short, we suggest that it is not only the warming and moistening of the low level air over\nthe ocean which is responsible for the development of the coastal low, but also the pattern of that\nwarming. This in turn must be related to the sea surface temperature pattern and the trajectories\nof the air relative to SST. While we are tempte(\' ,) conclude that this is the reason for the climatological maximum of cyclogenesis in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, we propose that the explanation\nbe treated as a hypothesis for the time being. It would be most interesting to conduct numerical\nexperiments with an ocean having a uniform temperature to determine whether coastal cyclogenesis\nalso occurs under such circumstances, and other experiments to assess the role of the position and\nstructure of the SST field.\n7. Summary and Conclusions\nIn cases of cold air outbreaks, we have shown that the combination of the shape of the coast\nand the sea surfa(.e isotherms can have a profound effect in establishing a mesoscale atmospheric\ncirculation as a result of differential heating due to both variations in overwater path length and the\nunderlying SST. When the coastal effects dominate a mesoscale front forms downstream of the\npoint marking the major bend in the orientation of the coastline. Moreover, the sea level isobars\ntend to parallel the shape of the coast, but pressure will always decrease with distance from shore\nas the boundary layer air is progressively warmed. Thus, when the coastline is concave towards the\ndownwinu direction a mesoscale low will form, and conversely when the coast is convex toward\nthat direction. However, on the time and space scales treated here, the Coriolis effect will generally\n\n12\n\n..n.__\t\n\nbar\t\n\ny.\n\nnot have time to work so that the induced winds will tend to accelerate across the isobars toward\nthe low pressure.\nThe strength of the induced mesoscale circulation obviously depends upon the original thermal\ncontrast between the land air and the SST. In any case, the mesoscale circulation and enhanced\nwinds will In the first Instance, feedback oil\n\n\t ocean by intensifying the wave growth and altering\n\ntheir directions. This is one of the possible reasons for the observation of bidirectional ocean wave\nspectra when the synoptic scale flow is unidirectional. The induced pattern of sea surface stress is\nalso bound to have an additional effect on the coastal oceanic circulation, but this has not been\ndiscussed in the present paper.\nIt is worth noting that where the coastline and the isotherm pattern are more or less normal\nto the mean flow in the boundary layer, and the thermal contrast is sufficiently large, the cloud \t\n\n\'\n\nstreets formed downstream will be convective in nature and oriented with the axes of roll vortices\nalong the wind direction. The convective elements will also grow three dimensionally in the downwind direction in rough proportion to the depth of the boundary layer.\nOil\n\n\t other hand, where the mean wind in the boundary layer is nearly parallel to the coast-\n\nline and the SST isotherm pattern and the sea level isobars tend to parallel the coastline as noted\nearlier, one will establish a significant vertical wind shear across the inversion at the top of the\nboundary layer. The combination of the thermal stability and strong shear in this region is thus\nlikely to give rise to Keivin-Helmholtz waves as observed in the Landsat picture of Fig. 1.\nIt is noteworthy that explosive cyclogenesis occurred on February 18-19, 1979, immediately\nfollowing the day of the present study, giving rise to the famous Presidents\' Day cyclone. Bosart\n(1981) and R. Atlas and Rosenberg3 (private communication) agree that the oceanic fluxes of heat\nand moisture were critical to the development of this storm. However, we hypothesize that it is\nthe differential heating resulting from the passage of air over the sea surface temperature pattern\n\ni\n\n13\t\n\n;.1\n\nwhich is probably the crucial Awtor. This may explain the climatological peak frequency of\ncyclogenesis in the vicinity of gape Hatteras which is downwind of the core of the Gulf Stream\nwhen the surface winds are from the east or northeast.\nFinally we note that almost none of the above interpretations would have been possible with.\nout the high resolution Landsat pictures. We believe that an understanding of many such physical\nprocesses will emerge from the detailed study of such high resolution imagery and recommend that\nmeteorologists and oceanographers exploit them fully.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are most grateful to Mr. William Byerly of Systems and Applied Sciences Corporation for\nhis enthusiastic effort on programming and data analysis.
