b'Nanotube Production Devices Expand Research Capabilities\nNASA Technology\n\nI\n\nn order for the Hubble Space Telescope to take\nincredible, never-seen-before shots of celestial bodies\nand then send them back to Earth, the spacecraft\nneeds power. While in orbit, Hubble cannot plug into an\nelectrical outlet or stop at a store for some batteries. One\nof the ways NASA supplies power aboard a spacecraft is\nby harnessing energy from the most powerful entity in\nthe solar system: the Sun. Since the 1960s, photovoltaic\ntechnology, or technology that converts sunlight into\nelectricity, has been instrumental in the exploration of\nspace.\nTo build upon existing photovoltaic technology,\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Research Center has worked on a variety\nof innovative designs and materials to incorporate into\nphotovoltaic cells, the building blocks of solar power systems. One of these materials is the carbon nanotube\xe2\x80\x94a\ntiny structure about 50,000 times finer than the average\nhuman hair, with notably high electrical and thermal con-\n\nductivity and an extreme amount of mechanical strength.\nSuch properties give carbon nanotubes great potential to\nenhance the reliability of power generation and storage\ndevices in space and on Earth.\nDennis J. Flood, the branch chief of the photovoltaic\ndivision at Glenn in the 1990s, was looking into using\ncarbon nanotubes to improve the efficiency of solar\ncells when he ran into a major roadblock\xe2\x80\x94high-quality\ncarbon nanotubes were not readily available. To address\nthis problem, one of the chemists in Flood\xe2\x80\x99s group came\nup with a process and system for growing them.\nA senior chemist at Glenn, Aloysius F. Hepp, devised\nan injection chemical vapor deposition process using a\nspecific organometallic catalyst in a two-zone furnace.\nHepp\xe2\x80\x99s group found the unique process produced highquality carbon nanotubes with less than 5 percent metal\nimpurity. In addition, the process was more efficient than\nexisting techniques, as it eliminated pre-patterning of the\nsubstrate used for growing the nanotubes, a timely and\ncost-prohibitive step.\n\nPartnership\nBecause Glenn was more interested in the photovoltaic\ntechnology that could benefit from the incorporation of\ncarbon nanotubes, and not in the actual production of\nthe carbon nanotubes themselves, the Center released the\ntechnology to the inventors\xe2\x80\x94Hepp and fellow researcher\nJerry Harris, associate professor of chemistry at Northwest\nNazarene University\xe2\x80\x94in 2005. By that time, Flood had\nretired from NASA, and he and his son, Dennis M. Flood,\nfounded Nanotech Innovations in Oberlin, Ohio. They\nfiled a full patent application, and in 2010, Nanotech\nInnovations was awarded a patent for the process and\napparatus to grow high-quality, low-impurity carbon\nnanotubes.\nThis transmission electron microscope high-resolution image\nshows aligned, high-quality, low-impurity carbon nanotubes\ngrown by a novel process and system invented at Glenn\nResearch Center.\n\n148\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nBenefits\nFor several years, the company has focused on improvement. Now a portable, bench-top system, the technology\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an influx of people that\nneed to be trained in nanotechnology \xe2\x80\xa6 We\nare starting to help to develop a curriculum\nthat can train the next generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xc2\xad Dennis M. Flood, Nanotech Innovations\ncan make research-scale quantities of high-quality nanotubes within just a few hours. Called the SSP-354, one of\nthe major advantages of the NASA-derived technology is\nthat it is a single-step process. Most processes for growing carbon nanotubes require at least a two-step process,\nexplains the younger Flood, but the SSP-354 does not\nrequire catalyst pre-deposition or expensive substrate\npreparation. The user simply loads the injector and\npresses \xe2\x80\x9cStart.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAccording to Nanotech Innovations, the carbon\nnanotubes produced by the system have low catalyst\ncontent (a low amount of impurity), which has been\ndemonstrated by tests and analysis techniques including\nthermogravimetric analysis, Raman spectrometry, and\nelectron microscopy. An additional advantage is that the\ntechnology allows full control of the growth parameters\nfor the desired nanotubes.\nToday, the machine is supporting the incorporation\nof carbon nanotubes into science curricula, research, and\nproduct development endeavors. Rice University purchased the SSP-354, and according to Andrew R. Barron,\na professor of materials science at Rice, \xe2\x80\x9cThis instrument\nadds fabrication of high-quality, multi-walled carbon\nnanotubes to our repertoire in a simple-to-use-system that\neven first-year undergraduate students can use.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNorth Dakota State\xe2\x80\x99s College of Science also purchased the technology and is integrating it into their\nnanoscience curriculum. The Akron University Polymer\nScience Department purchased the SSP-354 for its laboratory and finds the system has become an integral part of\nits research and development efforts.\nSpinoff 2011\n\nThe NASA-derived system from Nanotech Innovations makes\ncarbon nanotubes for science curricula, research, and product\ndevelopment. Carbon nanotubes show great promise for\napplications such as power devices, sensors, and drug\ndelivery systems.\n\nof results makes it an ideal instrument for anyone using\ncarbon nanotubes in their work,\xe2\x80\x9d says Oleg Kuznetsov,\na research scientist with member company Natcore\nTechnology Inc.\nMost recently, Nanotech Innovations announced that\nit signed Nanoscience Instruments Inc. to be the exclusive distributor of the SSP-354 in the United States. The\ncompany also announced a new partnership with Strem\nChemicals Inc. to sell nanotube arrays produced with the\nSSP-354.\nFlood says NASA played a large part in the success of\nNanotech Innovations. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that the genesis of this\ntechnology is a NASA technology has helped us and continues to help us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Flood. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we are the owners,\nbut I think NASA adds a lot of credibility to what we are\nand what we have.\xe2\x80\x9d v\n\nSpinoff 2011\t\n\ndevelop a curriculum that can train the next generation of\nlab technicians.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the Ohio State University\xe2\x80\x99s Wright Center for\nPhotovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization, the\nSSP-354 gives member companies a solution for obtaining\nhigh-quality carbon nanotubes for their research and\nproduct development. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ease of use and repeatability\n\nIndustrial\nProductivity\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith so many next-generation devices looking to\nuse carbon nanotubes, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a big push\nfor lab technicians and other people who are familiar\nwith the synthesis, handling, and applications of carbon\nnanotubes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Flood. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an influx of\npeople that need to be trained in nanotechnology, and\ncarbon nanotubes in particular.
