b'Computer Technology\n\nStray Light Analysis\nhedding light on a subject may be wanted by\nsome. But in the optics industry, rays of stray\nlight are a troublesome factor.\nBased on a Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) contract from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n(JPL), TracePromis state-of-the-art interactive software\ncreated by Lambda Research Corporation of Littleton,\nMassachusetts to detect stray light in optical systems.\nAn image can be ruined by incidental light in an optical\nsystem, like static spoils quality sound. To maintain\nimage excellence from an optical system, stray light must\nbe detected and eliminated.\nFounded in 1992, Lambda Research Corporation\noffers stray light analysis, optical system design and\nanalysis, optical testing, process control software and\ncustom software development.\nThe company\'s mission is direct: establish a\ntechnology bridge between optical and mechanical\nengineers. That corporate credo is embraced in TracePro,\nthe first optical analysis software program to have as its\na\ncore, ACIS@, solid modeling tool that is an industry\nstandard. The ACIS kernel in TracePro provides a vast\narray of capabilities to create, manipulate, and visualize\ndesigns.\nIntroduced in 1996, TracePro is a Windowsa 951\nWindows NTn\' application, with roots in the Monte\nCarlo simulation aspect of ray tracing. This permits the\nuser to compute optical flux as it propagates through a\nmodel. Users of the optics software can perform stray\nlight analysis, illumination analysis, and optical systems\nanalysis. The software has an intuitive graphical user\ninterface, familiar Windows pull-down menus, dialog\nboxes and context-sensitive help.\nLambda Research Corporation president, Edward\nFreniere, says that TracePro is targeted to optical analysts\nand mechanical, optical and design engineers across a\nbroad range of industries. "TracePro is the product I\nhave wanted to develop for the past ten years. TracePro\nis based on the philosophy that there\'s no reason for an\nengineer to do the drudgery that a computer can do,"\nFreniere says.\nTracePro accounts for absorption, specular reflection and refraction, scattering and aperture diffraction of\nlight. Output from the software consists of spatial\nirradiance plots and angular radiance plots. Results can\nalso be viewed as contour maps or as ray histories in\ntabular form.\nTracePro is adept at modeling solids such as lenses,\nbaffles, light pipes, integrating spheres, non-imaging\n\nconcentrators, and complete illumination systems.\nOptical system designs are capable of being visualized\nfrom multiple angles and in rendered views. Objects can\nbe moved and rotated, and modified with optical\nproperties assigned to them.\nWith Lambda Research\'s product, the process of\ngoing from optical system layout to the completed optomechanical product is streamlined. Tasks that demanded\na good part of an hour can be completed in a few\ncomputer mouse clicks, saving company time and\nmoney.\nMarketing of TracePro and other optical analysis\nsoftware from Lambda Research is now underway\nthroughout the United States, Europe, and the Pacific\nRim. The firm\'s customer base includes corporations\nsuch as Lockheed Martin, Samsung Electronics and\nother manufacturing, optical, aerospace, and educational\ncompanies worldwide.\nIM\n\n@\n\n@\n\nTracePro is a trademark of Lambda Research Corporation.\n\nACIS is a registeredtrademark of Lambda Research Corporation.\nWindows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.\n\nm\n\nWindows NT is a trademark of Microsoft Corporation.\n\nLambda Reseatrhs TracePro sofrwa~\ndepicts rays of light mowing\nthrough an optical system.
