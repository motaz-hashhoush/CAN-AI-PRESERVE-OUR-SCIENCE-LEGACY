The OPLE concept can be applied to various platform u s e r\nrequirements such a s oceanographic buoys, commercial aircraft, ocean vessels,\nanimal migration studies, etc. However, the platform which presents the most\nstringent packaging requirements and, which is of primary concern i n the OPLE\nExperiment , is the meteorological balloon. An operational balloon system\n(Reference 1)with the capability of providing synoptic global weather information suitable for fast and accurate weather prediction would require thousands\nof balloons. Such a system would be required to determine the location of each\nballoon and provide a communications link over which meteorological data could\nbe transmitted and yet not exceed the payload packaging requirements that would\nbe imposed on such balloons. A basic premise for the conception of any balloon\nsystem is then the degree of simplicity inherent in the balloon\'s electronic package.\nOnce the feasibility of the OPLE concept is demonstrated, it w i l l be possible\nto design an operational data collection and location system capable of serving a\nwide variety of users on a global scale. Using the OPLE concept as a basis,\ncommercial aircraft, including the Super Sonic Transport, could be tied together\nin an air traffic control system capable of safely directing the anticipated air\ntraffic f o r many decades to come. Also, flight schedules and terminal traffic\nwould be better controlled if timely knowledge was available a s to exact arrival\ntimes. Steamship lines could also use this system for scheduling arrival times\nand use of port facilities to more economically operate and regulate their overall traffic. Another possible application is as a recovery aid for the Apollo reentry vehicle. With OPLE type equipment aboard the Apollo vehicle and the\nvarious units of the recovery force including the helicopters, it would be possible\nfor a control center to know the relative position of all the recovery units and\nspacecraft to within a few hundred yards and the absolute position of any one of\nthem t o within one o r two miles, regardless of the landing location. Meteorologists using an OPLE system would have a means of gaining atmospheric and\nsurface data through the use of balloons and buoys. In the case of tethered\nbuoys the Omega portion of the receiver could be off with only the data channel\nactivated. In the event of a broken tether the Omega receiver could be activated\nto give the position of the wayward buoy to service vessels. Oceanographers\ndesiring ocean current and sea state data could use the system in much the same\nway. Zoologists could utilize the basic concepts of the OPLE system to ascertain the migration routes of various land and air-breathing sea animals.\n1\n\nOne control center operating the entire system would greatly increase the\neconomy of the system for individual users. Anyone desiring to use the system\nwould inform the center of the intended region of operation, the platform frequency, and the number and time of the interrogations. The retrieved data and\nlocations could then be sent to the user on a real time basis o r be provided in a\nmore leisurely manner depending on the u s e r s requirements. An unmanned\nplatform could thus be tracked for scientific data and a manned conveyance\nwould be tracked for safety, control and scheduling purposes and in addition\nhave a communications channel to a central control center. It would then be\npossible t o learn more concerning the global phenomena of the earth and for the\nhigher speed and more complex transportation systems to operate in a safer and\nmore efficient manner.\n2.\n\nOPERATIONAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\n\nAn operational system, a s shown i n Figure 1, would consist of: (1)an OPLE\nControl Center (OCC), (2) a synchronous satellite, and (3) the OPLE Platform\nElectronic Packages (PEP\'S) working in conjunction with the Omega network.\nThe OPLE Control Center originates all the control signals that determine\nthe sequence of platform addresses and times of interrogation. The OCC monit o r s the Omega transmissions to derive timing and to determine the overall\nstate of the Omega system. Upon receiving satellite availability times from the\nSatellite Control Center, the OCC initiates a preprogrammed platform interrogation sequence which is transmitted to the platforms through the synchronous\nsatellite. A t the end of this interrogation sequence, the correctly addressed\nplatforms transmit an acquisitiodreference (A/R) tone to the satellite for transmission to the OCC where phase-lock-loops acquire the signals. Following the\nOCC acquisition period, the A/R tone is modulated with platform generated data\nby phase-shift-keying using a deviation of approximately G degrees. Following\nO\nthis data transmission period, the A/R tone is reduced in level and transmitted\nalong with the received Omega signals f o r approximately three minutes. The\nA/R tone is present throughout the P E P transmission sequence and is continually\ntracked to provide a constant reference signal, which minimizes the effects of\nvariations in the transmission link from the P E P to satellite to OCC.\n2.1 Omega System Description\n\nThe Omega Navigational System (Reference 2) was developed at the Naval\nElectronics Laboratory with assistance f r o m several other organizations including the Harvard Cruft Laboratory and the Naval Research Laboratory. Evolution\nof the Omega system followed an extensive investigation of very-low-frequency\n(VLF) propagation characteristics throughout the last decade. One result of\n\n2\n\nSYNCHRONOUS SATELL I TE\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL\nAND POSITION D A T A\nMETEOROLOGICAL\nPOSITION DATA\n\nOMEGA NETWORK\nSTATUS AND TIMING\n\nTR AN SMI T TE R\n\nFigure\n\n1.\n\nOPLE Configuration\n\n3\n\nthese investigations has been to show that the 1 0 kHz region of the VLF spectrum\nhas a very low attenuation rate and exhibits exceptional phase stability. These\ncharacteristics permit worldwide propagation of radio waves and allow phase\nmeasurements with an r m s variation of l e s s than five microseconds. Within\nthis frequency range the radiated energy is propagated as a guided wave in the\nspace between the earth and the reflecting ionosphere with an attenuation rate\nof nearly that due to inverse spreading loss. Near the transmitter interference\nbetween the ground wave and the single-mode guided wave transmission cause\nphase shifts of considerable magnitude. Beyond a few hundred miles the singlemode propagation dominates and the signal can be used for position measurements up to a distance of at least 5000 miles from the transmitter. Frequencies\nbetween 10 and 14 kHz were chosen for use with Omega because of the high\nexcitation of the first mode and the low interference effects at sunrise and sunset of the higher mode.\nThe optimization of the Omega frequencies with respect to the above characteristics of the transmission medium has been verified by experimental\nresults. The experimental phase of the Omega program is essentially completed\nand an overall operational design of considerable flexibility has been established\nand is being implemented. The Omega Project Office, under the Chief of Navy\nMaterial, has been established to direct the construction of the entire Omega\nnetwork. Three operational stations have been constructed and a r e providing\ncoverage over the northwestern quadrant of the earth. The complete Omega\nnetwork could be operational by 1971 with the construction of five additional\nstations.\nThe operational Omega system will use eight VLF transmitting stations\nradiating 10 kilowatts of power each, with an average separation between stations of about 5000 nautical miles. It is expected that all eight transmissions\nwill be receivable at nearly every point on earth and that at least five of the\neight will produce usable signals with only a short monopole receiving antenna.\nThe Omega receiver measures the relative phase of the signals from at least\ntwo pairs of stations, i.e., three transmitters. Two lines of position (isophase\ncontours) a r e generated by the phase difference between each of the two transmitter pairs and the position of the receiver is established by the intersection\nof the two isophase hyperbolic contours. The very long base lines between stations results in position lines that diverge only slightly and that c r o s s each\nother at nearly right angles. This geometric excellence, along with the high\ndegree of phase stability and low attentuation rates of VLF radio signals, r e sults in a reliable system with good absolute accuracy that varies little with\ngeographical position.\nThe uncertainty in an Omega line of position can be summarized as one\nstandard deviation of about three-tenths of a mile over a daytime propagation\n4\n\npath and about twice that at night. By the time the Omega network becomes\noperational, it is expected that the r m s fix e r r o r , f o r all causes combined, will\nbe about one mile in the daytime and two miles at night (Reference 3). In recent\ntests performed by the Naval Research Laboratory, the rendezvous o r station\nkeeping accuracies attained w e r e around 200 yards (Reference 4). Thus, a fixed\nstation can provide very accurate relative position measurements (and velocity\nmeasurements through continual tracking) of platforms over a large area.\nThe Omega system, as presently being implemented , provides for considerable flexibility and future expansion. The transmitted signal spectrum is shown\nin Figure 2, while the transmitting station time multiplexing scheme is shown in\nFigure 3. The primary transmission frequencies are 10.2 kHz, 11.33 kHz and\n13.6 kHz with additional lane resolution difference frequencies of 11.33 Hz,\n45.33 Hz, and 226.66 Hz tones. In addition, eight other frequencies a r e shown in\nFigure 2, all of which are subharmonics of 408 kHz. Each of these eigkLtfrequencies is assigned to one of the eight transmitting stations in accoidatnce with\nthe time multiplexing method shown in Figure 3. These eight frequeJqcies permit\ntransmitter station identification, but they a r e not essential to the posiiion location function.\nAmbiguity resolution is performed by successive measurements of the received phase of the tone difference frequencies. These frequencies have been\nselected to permit construction of the difference frequencies listed in Table 1\nalong with the resulting ambiguity resolution steps. No dead reckoning, lane\ncounting o r log keeping is necessary and the transmitted sequence will permit\ncompletely automatic operation on an "as required" basis.\n2.2 Satellite System\nThe circle of illumination on the earth by an equatorial synchronous satellite\nhas a radius of about 81 degrees of longitude at the equator. This circle is\ncentered on the equator, and extends to within about 9 degrees ur each pole.\nWith two synchronous satellites in equatorial orbits spaced on opposite sides of\nthe earth, the total coverage would include all but a 17 degree v \' c 1 , ~ segment\ncircling the earth, as illustrated in Figure 4a. With three synchronous satellites\nin equatorial orbits equally spaced around the earth, complete coverage is provided from about 73 degrees north latitude to 73 degrees south latitude. This\ncoverage would extend t o the arctic and antarctic circles (located at approximately\n*66 degrees latitude) with a minimum platform-to-satellite elevation angle of\nabout 7 degrees. The two spherical triangular areas, located at the poles, which\nare not covered are illustrated by Figure 4b. By using one synchronous satellite\nwith a n inclined plane, along with two synchronous satellites in the eyuatorial\nplane, coverage of each pole could be obtained for one continuous period of time\neach day. The length of this time period depends on the angle of inclination of\n5\n\n10.14 k H z\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x989\n\n2\n\nN\n\nI\n\\o\n\n2\n\ncy\ncy\n\n+\nN\n\nI\n\nY\n\n\xe2\x80\x989\n\nI5?\nFigure\n\n2.\n\nSTATION\nA\n\nF]\n\nF\n\nOmega System Signal Spectrum\n\nlI\nI 10.462 k H z\n] 1\n10.736 k H z\n\nB\nC\n\nD\nE\nF\nG\n\nH\n\nFigure\n\n3.\n\nOmega Transmitted Signal Format\n\n6\n\n1\n\n_ -\n\nNorth Pole\nSatellite\n\nSouth Pole\nCross- hatc hed area\ni s covered by three\nsynchronous satel lites\nin equatorial orbits.\n\nFigure 4b.

The inclined plane allows the satellite to look over\nthe poles and view the entire area not seen by the other two satellites. Each\npolar a r e a would be entirely covered for a minimum of 4 hours per day. It\nseems that virtually any realistic operational requirement could be met by\nthree phased synchronous satellites, each with properly selected inclination\nangles.\n\n8\n\nAt synchronous altitude, the angle subtended by the earth is 16.4 degrees.\nThis would allow use of an antenna with approximately 20.1 dB gain which would,\nassuming zero pointing error, provide a minimum of 17.1 dB of gain over the entire illuminated area of the earth. An antenna pointing e r r o r of 25% (4.1 degrees)\nwould necessitate using an antenna with a gain of 1 6 dB gain, which would provide a minimum gain of 13.7 dB over the illuminated area of the earth. Thus,\nthe maximum allowable antenna gain is determined by the antenna pointing e r r o r ,\nand since 4 degrees of e r r o r is well within the capability of present mechanical\nand electrical stabilization systems, a nominal 14 dB gain antenna is feasible\nfor an operational system. Table 2 shows the required nominal transmitter\npowers required for two hypothetical operational systems based on a satellite\nantenna gain of 14 dB.\nTable 2\nOperational Performance Predictions\n136-148 MHz\nTRANSPONDER\n\n400-450 MHz\nTRANSPONDER\n\n-165.4 dBW\n( 1 000 "K)\n\n-168.4 dBW\n(500\xc2\xb0K)\n\n+10.0 dB\n\n+10.0 d B\n\n1.5 dB\n\n1.5 dB\n\n14.0 dB\n\n14.0 dB\n\n168.0 dB\n\n173.0 dB\n\nPLATFORM ANTENNA GAIN\n\n0.0 dB\n\n0.0 dB\n\nP U T F O R M CABLE LOSSES\n\n0.5 dB\n\n0.5 dB\n\n2.5 KHz CHANNEL BANDWIDTH\n\nSATELLITE RECEIVER NOISE POWER\nSATELLITE RECEIVER MARGIN\nSATELLITE CABLE AND DIPLEXER\nLOSSES\nSATELLITE ANTENNA GAIN\nMAXIMUM RANGE PATH LOSSES\n\nREQUIRED PLATFORM TRANSMITTER\nPOWER\n\n3.\n\n4 . 6 dBW\n(1.2 Watts)\n\n+2.6 dBW\n( 1.8 Watts)\n\nOPLE EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe OPLE experiment has been designed t o fully exercise and evaluate the\ntechniques and concepts (outlined in Section 2). The experiment will utilize the\n\n\'A preliminary description i s given in References 5 and 6.\n\n9\n\nATS/C satellite V H F communications repeater which can provide up to 40 simultaneous P E P transmission channels. A small number of platforms (approximately 12) will be placed at various locations in the Northern part of the Western\nHemisphere. The OCC along with the primary VHF antenna will be located at\nthe GSFC while the Rosman CDA station will be used to receive the SHF transmissions for landline relay to the OCC. The following sections describe, in\ndetail, the satellite transponder, P E P and OCC equipments. The operation of\nthe system transmission links and timing sequence is also discussed.\n3.1 Satellite Repeater Description\nThe ATS/C V H F transponder is an active frequency translation (Class B)\nrepeater receiving at 149.22 MHz and transmitting at 135.60 MHz. Figure 6\nis a functional block diagram of the transponder. The major satellite characteristics that a r e important to the OPLE system a r e listed in Table 3. The transponder utilizes a despun phased-array to allow the antenna beam to always remain positioned on the earth, thereby compensating for the stabilizing spin of\nthe satellite. The antenna is linearly polarized with a minimum specified gain\nof 7.5 dB. The antenna is composed of eight elements, each of which has individual receiver, phase shifters, and transmitter all coupled together with a\ncommon intermediate frequency conversion section.

The electronically controlled\nphase shifter in the receiver unit, driven by the satellite waveform generators,\nadjusts the output of each receiver to be in phase for only those signals that\noriginate from the earth. The eight receiver outputs are summed, filtered,\ndown-converted to an IF of 29.95 MHz, and passed through a crystal filter to\nlimit the receiver bandwidth to a nominal value of 100 kHz. The I F signal is\nthen amplified, up-converted t o 135.60 MHz and divided into eight equal parts.\nEach of the eight signals is routed t o a transmitter where it is phase shifted\nand further amplified to a power level of 5 watts. Each transmitter output is\nrouted through its respective diplexer to one of the antenna elements. The transmitter phase shifter is controlled by the waveform generator, causing the signals from each antenna to reinforce in the direction of the earth.\nA s a backup mode for the V H F repeater, a cross strap converter (shown in\nFigure 6) is used to convert the 135.60 MHz signal to 300 kHz. This signal is\nthen coupled to the SHF camera mode transponder through the voltage controlled\noscillator (VCO), illustrated in Figure 7. This mode of operation can be selected\nby command from the Satellite Control Center. Table 4 lists the significant\nSHF (camera mode) repeater characteristics.\n\nTable 4\nSHF Repeater Characteristics\n-\n\n~~\n\n.\n\nRepeater Output\n\n4119.6 MHz\n4178.6 MHz\n\nTransmitter O v f w t Power\n\n3.9 dBW\n\nSHF Antenna Type\n\nMechanically Despun\nPhase Array\n\nSHF Antenna Gain\n\n3\n\n25 MIlz\n\nTransmitter Carrier Frequencies\n\nI\n\nNarrow-Band Frequency\nModulation\n\nTotal Repeater Bandwidth\n\n-\n\n18 dB\n\nThe SIIF camera mode transponder accepts input signals t o the VCO over\nbaseband frequency range of\' 10 Hz to 5 MHz. The nominal VCO center\n\n12\n\n--J\n\n13\n\nfrequency is 65.39 MHz. The IF input signal level, derived from the VHF repeater, will be adjusted in amplitude so that the modulation index will be a\nminimum of 0.6 radians r m s and a maximum of 1.2 radians peak. This will result in a c a r r i e r always befng present in order to permit the use of a c a r r i e r tracking phase-lock-loop at the Satellite Control Center. The F M output of the\nVCO is routed through the I F postamplifier to the limiter amplifier. The signal\nis limited to the proper level and coupled to the high level mixer where it is\nconverted to the SHF transmitter frequency. It is then power-amplified by the\nTWT amplifier and coupled to the mechanically despun antenna which reinforces\nthe signal in the direction of the earth.\n3.2 Platform Electronics Package (PEP)\n\nThe P E P block diagram is shown in Figure 8. The operational sequence of\nthe platform is determined by an on-board timer. Upon receipt of the proper\nplatform address and upon the conclusion of the complete interrogation cycle\nthe platform equipment is turned on and proceeds through the following normal\nsequence :\na.\n\nTransmit acquisition/reference (A/R) tone\n\nb.\n\nTransmit meteorological sensor data\n\nc.\n\nTransmit received Omega signals\n\nd.\n\nReturn to standby mode.\n\nThe P E P is capable of responding to four commands transmitted through\nthe interrogation link as a part of the platform address. During the experiment,\nthe commands will initiate the following actions:\n1.\n\nNormal\n\n2.\n\nTurn off entire system until next day/night transition\n\n3.\n\nTransmit data only for entire three minute period\n\n4.\n\nAbort balloon.\n\nCommand Number (1)has already been described. Command Number (2)\nis used to switch the P E P into a minimum power condition where the only\nsystem operating will be the light sensor electronics. This command will take\neffect immediately after the P E P completes a transmission sequence. If the\n\n14\n\n- t\n\nE\n\n0,\n\nml\n\n0\n\nfi\nY\nU\n\n0\nm\n\na\nW\na\ncd\na\n\nm\n.-\n\nLL\n\nI\nU\n\n15\n\ncommand is received during daylight, the P E P will revert to its minimum power\ncondition until there is insufficient light to power the light sensor. A t this time\nthe VHF command receiver will be up-powered, and the P E P would again be\nready to respond t o interrogations. If this command is received during the night,\nthe P E P will remain essentially off until daylight awakens it. Command Number\n(3) will be used for system link measurements and test purposes. Command\nNumber (4)will be used for a balloon test and for resetting local monitoring\nequipment at remote sites.\nThe PEP has the capability of telemetering eight analog data channels. An\nanalog-to-digital converter is incorporated to encode the sensor inputs into a\nseven level binary format. For this experiment, the data inputs will include the\nfollowing:\n\na.\n\nTemperature inside the PEP\n\nb.\n\nTemperature outside the PEP\n\nc.\n\n+24 volt supply\n\nd.\n\n+6 volt supply\n\ne.\n\n-6 volt supply\n\nf.\n\nFor external monitoring equipment\n\ng.\n\nFor external monitoring equipment\n\nh.\n\nFor external monitoring equipment\n\nThe V H F receiver on board the P E P is operative at all times (except f o r\nday-night mode) and will receive the interrogation signals transmitted from the\nOCC through the satellite. The V H F receiver consists of a preselector, an R F\namplifier with a 3.5 dB noise figure, mixer, I F amplifier, crystal filter, limiterdiscriminator, and modulation sensing circuit. The receiver accepts a signal\nof 135.60 MHz that is FSK modulated with a deviation of S . 4 kHz. The discriminator detects the modulation while the modulation sensing circuit provides a dc\nsignal to turn on the address decoder. Bit and word synchronization is established and 40 lines of address-command-parity a r e received. If the platform\nrecognizes one of these addresses as its own it goes to "alert" but remains\npassive. When the interrogation c a r r i e r ceases to be transmitted by the OCC,\na platform that has not been "alerted" reverts t o standby mode; whereas, an\n\'\'alerted" platform initiates its programmed transmission sequence by activating\n\n16\n\nthe timer. A sequence begins with transmission of the A/R tone at full P E P output power for approximately eleven seconds.\nMeteorological data from the on-board sensors is then accepted by the A-D\nconverter and the digitized data is phase modulated onto the A/R tone. The\nOmega signals a r e then passed through the VLF receiver. The VLF receiver\naccepts signals in a band from 10.2 through 13.6 kHz and compresses them to a\nbandwidth of 2 kHz. The mixing signals used in this process a r e derived from a\ntemperature controlled crystal oscillator (TCXO) through a frequency divider.\nThe frequency divider also provides signals to generate the A/R tone. The\ncompressed VLF signal band, along with the A/R tone, is then up-converted to\nVHF at 149.22 MHz, amplified and retransmitted through the VHF antenna for a\nperiod of approximately 3 minutes.\nFigure 9 illustrates the typical Omega data format with the frequencies\nshown for channel number twenty.

Oscillator f 2\nprovides a temperature compensated frequency source of 1part in l o 6 over six\nmonths. It is used to provide the local oscillator sources f o r up-converting and\ncompressing the Omega spectrum, the A/R tone, and the basic PEP timing.\nOscillator f i s preset to provide one of forty permissible transmission f r e quencies. To obtain maximum use of the available satellite transponder bandwidth (nominally 100 kHz wide on ATS/C), each platform is assigned a channel\napproximately 2.5 kHz wide within the transponder bandwidth (see Figure 11).\nThe transmitter consists of three stages: the driver, intermediate power\namplifier, and the power amplifier. The driver operates Class A and the r e maining two stages a r e operated very close to Class B. The design of the transmitter is optimized to provide maximum efficiency while still producing a\nminimum of intermodulation distortion. The average output power is 5 watts.\nSince the transmitter and VHF receiver a r e time sequenced in operation, a diplexer is not required; instead, a switched device protects the VHF receiver\ncircuitry during the PEP transmissions.\nIn an operational system the balloon platforms travel freely around the\nearth, and take on a variety of look angles to the satellite depending on their\nrelative position to the earth. For look angles t o the satellite that are outside\nof the 3 dB antenna beamwidth, the following situations exist:\n\na.\n\nThe antenna gain decreases;\n\nb.\n\nThe polarization ratio degrades so that the system transmission loss\nwill increase (5 dB for axial ratio of 3 dB); and\n\nc.\n\nThe amplitude of the P E P transmitted signal can vary by 2 dB depending on the polarization orientation of the balloon antenna relative to the\nlinear polarized satellite antenna.\n\nFor these reasons, an antenna with a hemispheric antenna pattern in conjunction\nwith a circular polarized satellite would be required for an operational system.\nThe gain of this antenna can be 0 dB with the maximum polarization loss reduced\nto an invariant 3 dB if the axial ratio of a circularly polarized satellite antenna\ncan be maintained to 1.5 dB over its earth coverage beamwidth (20 degrees).\nSince the experiment is restricted to the use of the ATS/C transponder f r e quencies and linearly polarized antenna configuration, two antennas will be used\nto economically simulate an all purpose operational antenna.\n18\n\nY\n\nVLF\nANTENNA\n\n-\n\nAN%NA\n\nA\n\n135.60 MH z\n\n49.22 M H z\n\n7-\n\n1\n\n153.91 MHz\n\nL\n\n1\n26.673 MHz\n\nP\nFILTER\n\ng\n\n+\n\nI\n\n0\n\nLIMITER\n\nc\n\nADDRESS\n\n3.1962MHz\n\n.49029 MHz\n\n5.49666 MHz\n\n-\n\n105.705 kHz\n101.790 kHz\n\n52\n-54\n\n-\n\n1.37417 MHz\nCONTROL\n\n50.895 kHz\n\nt\n\nFREQ.\nDIVIDER\n\nAUTO\nATTEN\n\nSYSTEM\nCONTROL\n65.4364 kHz\n116.331 kHz\nSENSORS\n\n-\n\n>\n\nFigure\n\n1\n\n-4\n\n-\n\nSIGNAL\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nPHASE\n\nFILTER\nF o 115.905\nB 55Hz\nW\n\nLIMITER\n\nFILTER\nF o 117.038\nB 140Hz\nW\n\nFILTER\nF o 115.390\n\nLIMITER\n\n-\n\nLIMITER\n\n--c\n\nB 140Hz\nW\n\n10.

Satellite Transponder Channel Allocations\n\nEither a loop-vee, o r a crossed-dipole VHF antenna will be available for\nuse with the PEP, depending on the satellite look angle from the deployment\nsite. The loop-vee antenna has a 3 dB beamwidth coverage from 20 degrees to\n50 degrees above the horizon and is right circularly polarized with an axial\nratio of tess than 3 dB over the half-power beamwidth. The crossed-dipole\nantenna is a 100 degree, 3 dB beamwidth (conical beam) and is circularly polarized with an axial ratio of l e s s than 3 dB over the half-power beamwidth.\nThe approximate dimensions of the P E P a r e 1 2 inches X 1 2 inches X 5-1/2\ninches with a weight of approximately 22 lb. A number of the packages at fixed\nsites will utilize a separate low voltage power supply. The approximate dimensions a r e 9 inches X 1 7 inches X 8 inches with a weight of approximately 22 lb.\nA small number of units will utilize batteries which will be approximately the\nsame size and weight as the power supply.\nThe standby receiver primary power required for nominal battery voltages\nis 1.1 watts while the maximum primary power required to transmit is 35 watts.\n3.3 OPLE Control Center (OCC)\n\nThe OCC p c ~ ~ ~ rsix basic functions as follows:\nlns\na.\n\nInterrogation of the PEP\'S via the satellite\n\nb.\n\nSimultaneous acquisition and continuous tracking of from one to four\nPE P\'s\n\nc.\n\nReception and demodulation of the meteorological data\n\n20\n\nd.\n\nReception and processing of the Omega VLF signals to obtain the platform locations\n\ne.\n\nDirect monitoring of the Omega stations in order to provide the required\ntiming references , and\n\nf.\n\nSimulation of full OPLE system operation by transmitting Gaussian\nwhite noise in unused P E P channels.\n\nIn addition to the prime functions of the OCC a self-check feature has been\nincorporated. The self-check signals, which consist of a simulated channel of\nsensor data, Omega signals and noise, can be used to verify the proper operation\nof the entire OCC.\nA simplified block diagram of the OCC is shown in Figure 12. A l l of the\nprocessor-controlled timing signals utilized in the OCC are shown c w s s-hatched.\nThe following paragraphs discuss the detailed operation of the O(\xe2\x80\x99C.\n3.3.1\n\nTransmitter Operation\n\nThe signal processor selects one of two transmitting modes for the 149.22\nMHz VHF transmitter. These a r e the Platform Electronic Packages (PEP)\ninterrogation mode and the P E P simulation mode. In the P E P interrogation\nmode, programmed P E P addresses and commands a r e transmitted by the OCC.\nNoise data and/or self-check signals can be selected for transmission during\nthe P E P data reception mode to simulate additional P E P data channels. A\nvariable-frequency synthesizer provides the required transmitter reference\nfrequency, and a power amplifier supplies the desired output power levels.\n3.3.2\n\nVHF Receiver\n\nA 135.60 MHz VHF receiver accepts the PEP data transmissions and the\nP E P simulation data and provides a 5 MHz intermediate frequency output. The\nrequired receiver reference frequencies a r e provided by a variable frequency\nsynthesizer. The 5 MHz VHF receiver output is converted to 500 kHz to provide inputs to the spectrum display unit and the frequency counter. In addition,\nthe 5 MHz OPLE data is applied to a receiver sow-sc selector which selects\neither the OPLE data or the internally generated self-check data for processing\nby the OCC\n\n.\n\n21\n\nWl\n\n-I\n\n22\n\n333\n..\n\nChannel Selectors\n\nFour identical phase-locked frequency converters (channel selectors) select\nany four P E P data channels for processing, one for each OPLE receiver. The\nchannel selector frequency synthesizer provides the 40 required reference frequencies, one for each of the 40 P E P data channels. In addition, a phase-lockedloop in each frequency converter tracks out any phase perturbations, caused by\nthe PEP-Satellite-OCC link, in the incoming OPLE data. The phase-locked\nfrequency converters provide detected meteorological data to the four sensor\ndata demodulators and position data (Omega signals) to the four OPLE receivers.\n\n334\n..\n\nData Demodulators\n\nThe meteorological data is decoded by the sensor data demodulators and\napplied to the signal processor for formating. The position data (phase information) is processed by the OPLE receivers to obtain analog signals which represent\nthe relative phases of the Omega signals.\n\n335\n..\n\nOmega Monitor Receivers\n\nThe Omega monitor receiver accepts VLF signals that are received directly\nfrom the Omega transmitters and provides monitor data in two forms. One of\nthese is Omega signal phase and/or amplitude information which is plotted\ndirectly on an analog recorder. The other is an analog representation of the\nrelative Omega signal phases, which is identical in form to the OPLE receiver\noutput data. The VLF synthesizer and programmer generates the self-check\nreference signals; the Omega commutation timing gates, and the Omega reference frequencies.\n\n336\n..\n\nOPLE/Omega Signal Processing\n\nThe Omega signal outputs of the OCC channel selectors a r e applied through\n40\'Hz bandpass filters (which separate the individual Omega frequencies) to high\ngain amplifierhimiters. The constant-amplitude signals out of the amplifier/\nlimiters a r e again applied to bandpass filters which remove the harmonics inserted by the limiters. Each of the resulting sinusoidal Omega signals is then\napplied to synchronous quadrature detectors. The outputs of the quadrature\ndetectors represent the sine and cosine of the Omega signals. The sine and\ncosine signals a r e applied to simple resistor-capacitor integrators which have\ntime constants of approximately one second. The analog sine and cosine outputs\nof the integrators a r e time division multiplexed and then digitized by an analog\nto digital convertor. The resulting binary signals a r e applied to a general purpose signal processor for further processing.\n\n23\n\nThe signal processor averages the Omega signals over a three-minute\nperiod to obtain improved S/N ratios; at the same time phase e r r o r s due to\ntime and frequency e r r o r s (Doppler shifts, platform oscillator instabilities,\net cetera) are minimized. The Omega signals received by the OCC have four\nmajor sources of error. These are: (1)platform reference oscillator instability, (2) platform velocity relative to the satellite, (3) platform velocity relative to the Omega stations, and (4)random noise. The processor reduces the\nnoise e r r o r by integrating each sample for approximately one second and then\nsumming 18 of these samples. The three frequency perturbations a r e grouped\ninto one offset frequency e r r o r that is assumed to be constant over the 180second sampling period. The offset frequency e r r o r appears as velocity components in the phase angle measurements of the Omega tones when their phases\na r e computed in the processor. This gives rise to two serious problems:\na.\n\nUnless this velocity component is nulled, phase measurements taken\nfor a given Omega frequency when summed for improvement of S/N\nratio will not add with equal phase angles,\n\nb,\n\nFor the purpose of hyperbolic lane resolution and triangular position\nlocation, phase measurements taken at different times will not correlate.\n\nIf the offset frequency is correctly calculated for one of the three Omega\nc a r r i e r signals, this value is used to determine a rough approximation for the\noffset frequency associated with the other two signals from the same Omega\nstation. Once offset frequencies have been calculated for all signals, corrected\nphase measurements a r e calculated and recorded.\n\nAppendix A outlines the techniques utilized, in the signal processor, for\ndetermining the offset frequency and correcting the Omega station phase measurements. Appendix B presents the calculated phase e r r o r s introduced by both\ninput noise and the OCC processing method. These e r r o r s a r e tabulated in\nTable B-1.\nThe general-purpose signal processor not only provides the required position data processing, but also performs the system control functions, and formats\nthe sensor data and position data for readout. Input/output information is communicated to the signal processor by means of a typewriter and magnetic tape\nrecorder. Operator controls and the required displays a r e provided at the control console, and real-time signals a r e derived from the NASA time code input.\nThe control console is capable of being operated by one operator and under\nnormal conditions will initiate all control center sequences and monitor the\noverall operating status of the OPLE experiment.\n\n24\n\n3 4 Svstem Transmission Links\n.\nProper operation of the OPLE system is dependent upon the achievement of\nsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratios in both the OCC to PEP link and the P E P to\nOCC link. During interrogation of the PEP by the OCC ,the signal-to-noise\nratio at the discriminator in each platform receiver determines the probability\nof bit e r r o r in the interrogation signal.\nFor the P E P to OCC link, the signal-to-noise ratio at the OCC receiver\ndetermines:\n\na.\n\nThe ability of the phase-lock circuits to acquire and continuously track\nthe (A/R) tone\n\nb.\n\nThe bit e r r o r rate on the P E P sensor data transmission\n\nc.\n\nThe accuracy of the Omega signal phase measurements.\n\nThe limiting portion of the overall system transmission link will be the\nP E P to OCC link. The following paragraphs discuss the system transmission\nlinks and include descriptions of the different modulation techniques used.\nThe interrogation link modulation and code characteristics a r e listed a s\nfollows:\nSplit phase (Manchester)\n48 bits/sec\nFSK\n*2.4 kHz\nBetter than\n\nType of Code\nBit Rate\nType of Modulation\nFrequency deviation\nWorst case bit e r r o r probability\n\nThe 149.22 MHz interrogation signal is down converted in the satellite transponder to 135.60 MHz. The VHF receiver on the P E P detects the modulation\nand turns on the P E P address decoder and starts the P E P clock. The individual\nPEP\'S remain on "alert" if they have received their correct address until all\n40 platforms have been interrogated. A f t e r the interrogation c a r r i e r ceases ,\nthe interrogated platforms are up-powered and begin their transmission\nsequence.\nThe transmission link from the platform to the OCC, via the satellite, is\ncomprised of three time multiplexed transmission modes listed a s follows:\n\n25\n\n1.\n\nTransmission of an (A/R) tone for acquisition by the OCC phase-lockloop\n\n2.\n\nTransmission of meteorological data\n\n3.\n\nTransmission of Omega position information\n\nIn both the data transmission mode and the Omega transmission mode, it is required that the A/R tone be in phase lock with a local reference signal at the\nO C C . To decrease the acquisition time a large loop bandwidth (150 Hz) is used,\nand all of the P E P transmitter power is provided for this transmission mode.\nThe acquisition time is approximately 7 seconds. When lock is achieved, the\ntime constant of the loop filter is automatically switched to change the loop\nbandwidth to 10 Hz for continuous tracking of the A/R tone when the P E P power\nis shared with the data signals.\nDuring meteorological data transmission, the A/R tone is PSK modulated\nwith the following characteristics:\nSplit phase Manchester\n56 bits/sec\nPSK\n*60\n\nType of Code\nBit rate\nModulation\nModulation index\n\nO\n\nThe effective bandwidth for the meteorological data demodulation is approximately 100 Hz.\nThe primary requirement of the platform to OCC Omega transmission link\nis that the added system noise be negligible compared to the P E P received VLF\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The VLF Omega receiver\'s worst-case output will consist of a number of discrete tones whose total power will be small compared\nwith the total VLF noise power. The minimum S/N that has been chosen f o r\nwhich the system will perform within specifications is 0 dB in a one Hz bandwidth. Figures 13 and 14 show the anticipated signal-to-noise ratios versus\nP E P receiver-Omega transmitter distances. Figure 13 is an approximate\nlower bound whereas Figure 14 is an approximate upper bound on an experimentally determined range of values (References 7 and 8).\nPhase perturbations of any kind over the VHF links between the platform\nand the OCC a r e sources of e r r o r in position location. Because phase comparisons a r e made between Omega signals which are transmitted with up to 5 seconds separation, it is possible that the effective path length from the P E P to the\nOCC can change considerably between the two Omega transmissions.

To alleviate this problem, the A/R tone is continuously transmitted\nalong with the Omega signals, which are fixed in frequency with respect to the\nA/R tone. A t the OCC a local oscillator is phase-locked to the A/R tone to remove the phase perturbations encountered in the VHF link. Table 5 summarizes\nthe typical received carrier-to-noise ratios expected for the transmission links.\n3.5 System Timing\n\nThe system timing after interrogation is controlled by the platform clock.\nThe timing sequence for the interrogation link is shown in Figure 15 and the\ntiming sequence f o r the PEP transmissions after cessation of the interrogation\nmodulation is shown in Figure 16.

If the platform recognizes one of the addresses it\ngoes to "alert" but remains passive.\n\nh.\n\ni.\n\nThe cessation of modulation causes the dc voltage from the modulation\nsensor to decay. When threshold is reached, the platform timing clock\nwill begin operation. The accuracy of the clock is 1 part in l o 6 , however, the initial turn-on has a tolerance of *40 milliseconds. Simultaneously with the start of the clock, power supplies a r e turned on to\nbegin transmitting the A/R tone for a period of 250 milliseconds. Thus,\nthe A/R tone will be at full power approximately 0.5 second after t = 0.\n\nj.\n\nThe A/R tone will be transmitted at full power for approximately 1\n1\nseconds. J u s t A/R tone transmission will end at time t = 11.8 seconds.\nSensor data modulation begins at this time.\n\nk.\n\nSensor data is transmitted for 3.9 seconds and ceases at time t = 15.8\nseconds\n\n1.\n\nAt this time A/R tone level is reduced to 0.5 watts and the Omega signals a r e turned on.

Seven of these will be located at widely spaced fixed sites\nto evaluate V L F propagation parameters, V H F communication links and unattented equipment performance. There will also be five mobile equipments\n\n32\n\nlocated to evaluate (in addition to the above) differential location accuracy, velocity measurements through sequential interrogations, Doppler effects, and\nmultipath effects\n\n.\n\nFour of the fixed sites are NASA operated tracking stations which will provide good voice communications with GSFC and allow ease of installation. The\nNetwork Engineering and Operations Division of GSFC will assist in the installation and housing of these units.\nThe investigators will directly deploy three units. The first unit is the\nengineering model P E P and it will be permanently rack mounted in the OCC to\nprovide a standard reference for system operational checks. The second unit\nwill be deployed in the vicinity of GSFC and moved periodically to determine\nthe resolution of the system for fixed intervals during the experiment. The\nthird unit will be van mounted to evaluate V H F and VLF communications under\nfixed and moving conditions. The VLF reception through these units will be\ncompared with the VLF monitoring station at GSFC and with Omega receivers\nlocated adjacent to several of the PEP\'S.\nThe Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) will assist in\nthe deployment of four units. The first unit will be a fixed ground platform located in the North Central region of the United States. The site will be located\nat St. Cloud, Minnesota, a weather station which can provide a good weather\nhistory of the area to correlate with the reception of Omega signals.

This\nplan is designed to demonstrate the full capability of the OPLE system to perform its basic objectives. These objectives in order of their importance a r e\n(1)the interrogation and position determination of a single remote platform,\n(2) the simultaneous interrogation and position determination of up to four remote platforms , (3) the investigation of system performance with moving vehicles including van, ship, aircraft, and possible balloon and buoy platforms and\n(4) the investigation of differential OPLE measurement techniques. The operational test plan is designed to cover six months of testing. It includes four\nphases with each succeeding phase providing for more intensive and comprehensive tests than the previous phase. However, certain basic tests will be\ncontinued throughout the test period in order to obtain the necessary amount of\nlong term data and to establish confidence in the overall operation of the OPLE\nsystem.\nThe first test phase consists of a group of basic engineering tests to be\ncalled the Engineering Test Plan. This phase of the test will last for\n\n35\n\napproximately fifteen days and is designed to provide confidence in the overall\nadequacy of the system. The tests will be in the form of an operational performance checkout of the basic components of the experiment. The primary\nobjective of this test phase will be t o demonstrate the capability to locate one\nremote platform with a reasonable degree of accuracy ($2 n.mi.) on a reliable\nbasis.\nThe second test phase is designed to acquire data on the multiple access\ncapability of the experiment. Up to four remote platforms will be simultaneously\ninterrogated on a routine basis. The primary objective of this phase is to demonstrate the capability of simultaneously locating with a reasonable degree of\naccuracy (f2 n.mi.) up to four remote platforms.\nThe third phase of tests is designed to measure the e r r o r contributions of\neach portion of the system as well as the total system error. The primary objective of this phase of the test program is to determine the e r r o r s inherent in\nthe system and to assess the magnitude of the contribution of each portion of the\nsystem.\nThe fourth phase of tests is designed to provide long term routine data on\nthe operation of the experiment. The primary purpose of this phase is to determine the overall capability and reliability of the experimental system including\na simulation of up to forty platforms.\nThe test plan incorporates communication link evaluation tests which will\ndetermine the characteristics of the various transmission links used by the\nOPLE experiment. This includes measurements of the VLF propagation parameters which effect the performance of the OPLE system such as the VLF\npropagation velocity as affected by diurnal and seasonal changes, the nature\nof the band limited VLF noise spectrum and its affect on the accuracy of the\nOMEGA phase measurements, the VLF signal strength at various distances and\ndirections from the Omega transmitting stations, and the relative phase measurement accuracy obtainable between two platforms as a function of platform separation distance. Sufficicnt data will be collccted to support a complete statisti cnl mxlysi s cf the V L F parameters including absolute accuracy, relative\naccuracy, and ambiguity resolution. Measurements of the V H F link to determine frequency and phase stability, noise characteristics, multipath propagation, cross-channel interference and other V H F parameters pertinent to the\nOPLE system performancc a r e included. Data will be collected to permit a\nstatistical analysis of the V H F parameters and to determine the degree that\neach one affects the OPLE systcm performance. Successive tests will be conducted at different times of the day to investigate the satellite VHF link characteristics. The effect of atmospheric and other disturbances (rain, clouds, fog,\n\nlightning, etc.) will be investigated to the extent permitted by the existing conditions at the time of conducting the experiment. Measurements will be made of\nthe received signal strength, dynamic range, signal-to-noise ratio, fade characteristics, phase modulation and noise frequency modulation, frequency translation and stability, intermodulation distortion, and/or other parameters as applicable for the type of source signal.\nThe test plan also includes measurements of the SHF link to determine its\nperformance parameters and to compare it with the performance of the VHF link.\n6.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration will conduct the scientific investigation of the Omega Position\nLocation Equipment Experiment and i s producing the necessary equipments to\ndemonstrate operational feasibility.\nResponsibility for the investigation is assigned to the Application Experiments Branch of the Systems Division, Goddard Space Flight Center.

John W. Townsend, Jr. of the Goddard Space Flight Center in January\n1965. He referred the authors to Mr. H. S. Moore of\nthe National Environmental Satellite Center who was\nperforming a preliminary system definition of the\nGHOSTS and SCOMO concepts in which the Omega\nSystem was considered the best means for balloon\nlocation.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance\nand support of many governmental and private individu a l s and organizations who have been of great help\nduring the formative stages of the OPLE concept.\n\n40\n\nAPPENDIX A\nOCC PROCESSING O F THE OMEGA SIGNALS\n\nThe OPLE Control Center utilizes an open loop offset-frequency estimating\ntechnique to eliminate the need for a highly stable frequency source on the platfor six months). The offsetform (the actual requirement being 1 X\nfrequency e r r o r introduced into the platform transmission is proportional to\nthe P E P local oscillator stability and the doppler frequency shifts between the\nplatform and both the satellite and the Omega stations.\nThe Omega signal is corrected for frequency e r r o r s by a two-step process.\nThe first step employs a trial and e r r o r method which applies a series of anticipated corrections and then selects the optimum correction value. This reduces the offset over the 180-second period from several cycles to a value l e s s\nthan 270 degrees. This is a rough approximation for the true frequency and is\nfurther processed in the second step to obtain a fine value of frequency offset.\nThe fine correction for the 10.2 kHz Omega frequency is multiplied by a constant\nand used as the rough approximation of the frequency offset for the 11.33 kHz\nand 13.6 kHz signals that a r e transmitted from the same Omega station.\nThe value of the correction factor can be determined by calculating the\nmaximum frequency offset due to worst-case conditions. The upper and lower\nlimit of the trial offset coorection factors is established by the maximum frequency offset, and the number of samples attempted is determined by the output\nresolution requirements.\nThe frequency offset, wd, for the 10.2-kHz Omega frequency can be expressed a s follows: (Similar expressions result for the 11.33 and 13.6 kHz\nsignals).\n\nwd\n\n-\n\nf10.2 k c\n\n=\n\n(17.5 Vp\n\nt\n\n0.73 V, + 10,626 0,)\n\nwhere\n\nf\n\n= total offset frequency in Hz at the indicated c a r r i e r frequency\n\nvp\n\n= component of platform velocity in knots toward the Omega trans-\n\nmitter\n\n41\n\nV,\n\n= relative platform velocity in knots toward the satellite\n\nos = stability of platform oscillator in parts per million\nSubstituting the worst-case conditions, Vp = Vs = 200 knots and Os =\ninto the offset equation results in a maximum offset frequency (w,)\nmax of h0.0143 Hz.\n1x\n\nFor a 180-second sampling period, this corresponds to a rotation of\nk2.57 Hz.\n\nAside from the values of trial offsets attempted, the system sampling r a t e\nimposes a limit on the maximum correctable frequency offset. F o r each Omega\nsignal, 18 samples 10 seconds apart a r e taken over a period of 180-seconds.\nSince unambiguous results a r e reached if a sine wave is sampled at least twice\nper cycle, the system upper limit for maximum frequency correction is established by this sampling rate. For 18 samples, nine cycles of frequency offset\ncan be corrected without ambiguity.\nThe offset correction values applied must be large enough to correct f o r\n0.0143 Hz. Therefore, the maximum correction value applied (wc) rnax must be\nequal to or greater than (wd) max.\n\n( wC) rnax\n\n2 A0.0143 Hz,\n\nthan let (wC) max = hO.02 Hz.\n\nFor this value\ncan be determined\nsor capability. By\na s a function of Os\n\nof frequency offset, a range of combinations of Os and Vp\n(for the case where Vp = Vs ) that will not exceed the processubstituting 0.02 into the offset equation and solving f o r Vp\nthe following expression results.\n\nvP\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1100\n\n-\n\n580 Os\n\n(A-2)\n\nThis equation i s plotted in Figure A-1.

The wc value corresponding to the largest signal vector is the rough\napproximation for the frequency offset.

The e r r o r\nafter nine samples contributes to the offset frequency e r r o r as calculated during the second processing step, while t h t for 18 samples is applied to the total\nphase e r r o r of each Omega signal. Factors which determine the magnitude of\nthe noise-induced e r r o r a r e the S/N ratio, the number of samples, and the total\nuncorrected rotation of the signal vector occurring during the sampling periods.\nThe equation for the rms value of the phase e r r o r (eoN ) is developed by\nconsidering the phase measurement vectors shown on Figure B-1. The signal\nvector without noise is Vs ,which is composed of the sum of vectors V, through\nVm rotated through uncorrected angle 4 caused by the frequency error.\n\nN\n\nVS\n\nFigure\n\nB-1.\n\nPhase Measurement Vectors\n\nThe length of the resultant vector Vs , related to the length of the a r c defined by vectors V, through Vm, can be shown to be a factor (F) given by\n\n4\nF = -115" sin 4\n2\n\n51\n\nwhere 4 is the vector rotation between V, and Vm. It is clear that the resultant\nvalue of Vs for the summation of M unity vectors is simply MF. This resultant\nsignal vector (Vs) is modified by adding a composite noise vector N. Noise vector N has a normally distributed value of amplitude at an equally probable random\nphase angle. The rms noise amplitude associated with each unity-signal vector\n(VI) is 1/S by definition, where S is the signal-to-noise ratio expressed in volts.\nThen, the composite rms magnitude of M noise vectors can be expressed as\nN = M/S. This composite noise vector has a random phase angle with respect\nto the signal vector, so that the r m s value of the quadrature component is the\nnoise vector magnitude divided by two. The r m s value of the phase e r r o r ( c e N )\nis:\n\n-\n\ntan-\'\n\n1\n\nF S m \'\n\nThe resultant noise-induced phase e r r o r s are plotted in Figure B-2 for both\nnine and 18 samples as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. An uncorrected vect o r rotation value of 90 degrees is assumed in both cases. The rms value of\nphase angle e r r o r at 0 dB S/N ratio is noted to be 10.5 degrees for 18 samples\nand 14.7 degrees for nine samples.\nThe following discussions show that the assumed uncorrected vector rotation of 90 degrees approximates the 1.3-sigma variance for both nine and 18\nsamples, and is therefore a conservative assumption. The measurement of\nphase angle from nine samples is used during the second processing step t o\ndetermine a more accurate value of offset frequency. Therefore, the uncorrected rotation for this phase angle measurement is a result of inaccuracies\nintroduced during the first processing step.\nFor the first processing step, sequential trail values of offset frequency\nwith increments of 0.00371 Hz are used to approximate the value of offset frequency. A residual phase rotation, randomly distributed between $120 and\n-120 degrees, is generated after 18 samples, o r between $60 and -60 degrees\nafter nine samples. In addition, a noise-induced rotation uncertainty must be\nadded to this value of uncorrected rotation. At 0 dB S / N ratio, the total uncorrected phase rotation for nine samples is l e s s than 90 degrees.

This correction is twice the difference\nbetween the phase angle of the first nine samples and the phase angles of the\nsecond nine samples. Since the e r r o r s of both nine-sample groups a r e independent and are calculated at a 0 dB S/N ratio to be 14.7 degrees ms for each\nnine-sample group, the total r m s uncorrected phase shift becomes (14.7 deg r e e s ) ( 2 ) ( a )= 41.6 degrees. The 2.2-sigma value of this e r r o r i s then 90\ndegrees. Thus, 98 percent of the inputs will be less than the assumed value of\n90 degrees.\nB.2 PHASE TIME SHIFT ERROR DUE TO OFFSET FREQUENCY\nINACCURACY\nThe computed value of offset frequency for each of the Omega c a r r i e r frequencies contains some e r r o r which is a function of VLF noise. The magnitude\nof this error is determined by considering the second step of the correction\nprocess, which applies a correction factor to the best trial value of offset frequency selected by the first step of the process. The phase rotation factor applied by the second step is twice the angle of rotation correction between the\ntotal vector for the first and last nine samples. These vector values a r e computed from phase measurements and therefore contain errors. Because the\nphase angle e r r o r s f o r these two vectors are Gaussian distributed and uncorrelated, the total rotation correction phase e r r o r over the 180-second period\nbecomes 2 6 EO,,, where E O * is the phase angle e r r o r due to VLF noise after\nby\nnine samples. This is expressed as offset frequency e r r o r ( E n f ) the equation:\n\n6;A\n\nf\n\n= ___--__( 360" ) ( 180 seconds )\n=\n\n(B-3)\n\n0.00064 Hz for 0 dE? S/N\n\nThe primary effect of this offset frequency is to introduce a phase angle e r r o r\nwhen the phase angle measurements of the various Omega signals a r e timeshifted to determine the phase difference between a pair of Omega stations.\nThe maximum amount of time shift required is $4.4 seconds because all Omega\n\n54\n\nstations have relative transmission starting times between 0 and 8.8 seconds.\nTherefore, the rms value of phase e r r o r due to the e r r o r in computed offset\nfrequency ( e o f ) is no greater than\n\xe2\x82\xac8, =\n\nEAf\n\nx\n\n4.4 seconds\n\nx\n\n360"\n\n= 0.069 \xe2\x82\xac O n degrees.\n\n(B-4)\n\nThe resultant phase time-shift e r r o r is plotted as rms amplitude for various signal-to-noise ratios in Figure B-3. The r m s e r r o r value for a 0 dB S/N\nratio is noted to be 1 degree, and at a t 6 dB S/N ratio, it is 0.5 degrees.\nB.3 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC) ERROR\nThe digital output of the ADC contains seven data bits plus a sign bit. The\ndesign accuracy of the ADC is 0.1 percent with a corresponding e r r o r of approximately one-tenth the value represented by the least significant bit in the\ndigital output. This digital output also contains a quantizing e r r o r with squarelaw. distribution between -1/2 and t 1 / 2 , the value represented by the least significant bit. The effect of these e r r o r s on the phase angle measurement is not\nconsidered.\nThe value of the output from the seven-bit ADC is scaled so that the maximum possible Omega input signal will produce a full-scale output of the seven\nbits. This value is ensured by applying hard limiting to the signal-with-noise\nin the OPLE receiver. This limiting is done on a signal with a 40 Hz bandwidth.\nThe bandwidth is then reduced to 1 Hz by the action of the integrator. This r e duction of bandwidth after limiting reduces the signal by 1 7 dB for the case of\n0 dB S/N ratio in a 1 Hz bandwidth. Thus, the maximum output of the ADC\nunder the condition of 0 dB S/N ratio is four data bits. Letting these four bits\nrepresent a value of 16, and considering a summation over 18 samples, the\nmaximum value of the summation of either the X o r Y components is seen to\n.be 288 (16 x 18). The total converter e r r o r (rms) for each X o r Y reading is\nassumed to be 0.6 in value. Then, the e r r o r in the summation of 18 X and 18 Y\nvalues becomes 0.6 X 18, o r 2.54. The values of phase e r r o r ( ~ 0 due to~the )\n~\n~\nanalog-to-digital converter a r e then calculated for several values of phase\nangle by adding the e r r o r to the X component and subtracting it from the Y component, as shown i n Table B-2. The maximum value of r m s phase e r r o r f o r the\nc a r r i e r s is noted to be 0.7 degrees, occurring over a wide range of phase angles.\nFor signals that have a -6 dB S/N ratio, the phase e r r o r becomes 1.4 degrees.\n\n55\n\nh\n\nrT)\n\nW\nW\n\nCY\n\nc3\nW\n\nn\n\nv\n\nCY\n0\nCY\nlY\nW\nW\n\n-J\n\nc3\nZ\n\na\n\nW\nY\n,\n\n6\n\nI\n\na\n\nY\ntY\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1 .o\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nNOISE-TO-SIGNAL VOLTAGE RATIO\n\nFigure\n\n8-3.\n\nT i m e Shift Phase Angle Error versus\n\n56\n\nS/N\n\nR a t i o in a\n\n1 Hz\n\nBandwidth\n\nTABLE B-2\nANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTER PHASE ERRORS\n\ne\n\n288 sin 0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n22.5\n\n110.22\n\n45\n\n288\n\n287.46\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n112.76\n\n266.08\n\n263.54\n\n23.2\n\n0.7\n\n203.64\n\n206.18\n\n203.64\n\n201.10\n\n45.7\n\nI ,\n\n67.5\n\n266.08\n\n268.62\n\n110.22\n\n107.68\n\n68.2\n\n0.7\n\n90\n\n288\n\n290.54\n\n0\n\n-2.54\n\n90.5\n\n0.5\n\n2.54\n\nB.4 VLF RECEIVER ERRORS\n\nThe Omega VLF receivers introaice two sources of error. The first is a\nnormal distribution of phase shift by the various filters at different signal levels.\nThe rms value of this phase e r r o r is one degree. The second source of e r r o r\nin the VLF receiver is due to nonlinearity and offset in each output integrator\ncircuit. The rms value of this e r r o r is equivalent to one bit of the ADV output.\nThe corresponding phase e r r o r is calculated as discussed in the previous paragraph, giving a maximum value of\n\ne\n\n288\n\n=\n\n45 - tan-\'\n\n=\n\nf\n\n28, -\n\n1\n\n0.3 degrees.\n\nThus, the total r m s phase e r r o r for the Omega receiver\n\n(E\n\nOR) is\n\nB.5 PHASE-LOCK LOOP TRACKING ERRORS\n\nThe function of the phase-lock loops is to track the A/R tones transmitted\nby the platforms. The accuracy of this process depends on the bandwidth of the\n57\n\nphase-lock loop, the magnitude in frequency of an input transient, and the VHF\npath S/N ratio. The design values a r e (1) a loop bandwidth of 20 Hz, (2) a one Hz\ntransient in frequency, and (3) a VHF link S/N ratio of 10 dB. Derating the S/N\nratio of 7.5 dB, the total rms phase e r r o r ( E B J for the phase-lock loop becomes\nthree degrees.\nB.6 DIGITAL PROCESSING ERROR\nThe digital processing of the Omega phase data results in e r r o r s due to\ntruncations, approximations of sine and cosine functions, etc. The value of this\ntotal digital processing e r r o r has not presently been determined since it is a\nfunction of the final computer program, which has not been written. However,\nthe e r r o r magnitude can be limited since 16 bits a r e available in the computer\nfor the processing of seven-bit inputs. An rms value of one degree is assumed\nfor this error.\n\n'
