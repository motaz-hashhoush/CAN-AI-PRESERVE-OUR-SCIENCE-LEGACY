Microstrip\npatch antennas\nare\nhighly desirable for aerospace applications\nbecause they are\nlightweight,\nconformal,\nand inexpensive\nsince they can be\nproduced\nusing conventional\nlithographic\nmethods.\nThese\nmicrostrip patch antennas are becoming increasingly\nimportant because\nof the proliferation\nof low Earth orbiting\ncommunications\nand remote sensing satellites that generally\ndemand phased array antenna systems advantageously\ncomprised of microstrip patch antennas. Microstrip patch antennas are "known and some of which are described in U.S. Pat.\nNos. 5,315,753;\n134; 5,777,581;\n\n5,448,252;\n5,561,435;\n5,589,845;\n5,818,391;\n5,838,282;\nand 5,870,057,\n\n5,694,\nall of\n\nwhich\nare herein incorporated\nby reference.\nThe patch\ngeometry\ncan be square, rectangular,\na disk or an annular\nring. A major drawback\nof microstrip\nantennas\nis their\ninherently\nnarrow instantaneous\nbandwidth,\ntypically\n1% or\nso. Intuitively\nobvious\napproaches\nto enhance bandwidth,\nsuch as the use of extremely\nlow permittivity\nsubstrates or\nthick substrates\nare typically\nmet with an undesirable\nincrease in antenna size or the generation\nof surface waves\nthat degrade the efficiency of the antennas.\n\n5\n\nJournal\n\nof Smart\n\nMaterials\n\nand Structures,\n\nVol.\n\n7. pp. 792-800,\n1998, herein incorporated\nby reference,\narranged a patch above a parasitic element and varied the\nseparation therebetween\nby using piezoelectric\nactuators\nto\nshift the frequency.

The application\nof an in-plane magnetic field onto this ferrite film advanta1o geously tuned the resonant frequency of a cross-polarized\nfield, but not the co-polarized\nfield. The tuning range was\n5.86 to 6.03 GHz, about 3%. Although each of these efforts\nfurther advanced the art, it is desired that further improvement be made to further increase patch antenna bandwidth\n15 so as to enhance their application\nto both the military and\ncommercial\nendeavors.\nCommercial\nand military\napplications include low cost tracking terminals to advantageously\ncomplement\nthe forthcoming\nwideband\nlow Earth orbiting\nsatellite constellations\nand stealthy communications\nand\n20 radar systems.\nOBJECTS\n\nOF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is the primary object of the present invention to provide\nfor a patch antenna having a bandwidth\nthat is maintained\n25\nabout a selectable frequency\nand which can be tuned over a\nrelatively\nbroad frequency\nrange.\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide for\na broadband patch antenna that can be used for reception at\n30 a selected individual frequency, such as 19 GHz, and transmission at another individually\nselected frequency,\nsuch as\n29 GHz.\nIt is still another\n\nobject of the present invention\n\nfor a broadband\npatch antenna\n35 relatively\ninexpensive\nmanner,\ntional photolithography\nsimilar\ntors and printed circuits.\n\nto provide\n\nthat may be fabricated\nin a\nsuch as by using convento that use for semiconduc-\n\nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide for\na broadband\npatch antenna having an odd-order\nmode of\n40 operation generating\na broadband\nbeam, and also allowing\nfor tuning by applying adc voltage between the radiating\nelement and ground plane.\n\nSeveral approaches\nare known to increase patch antenna\nIt is a still further object of the present invention\nto\nbandwidth.\nFor example,\nstacked patches have been used to\nprovide\na ferroelectric\nfilm having a dielectric\nconstant\ngenerate\ndual resonant\nfrequencies.\nIn this approach,\na 45 which is a function of the voltage applied across the film so\nbottom patch is covered with a dielectric layer that serves as\nas to modify the dielectric\nconstant\nand correspondingly\nthe substrate for a top patch.
