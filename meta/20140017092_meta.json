Analysis of biometry parameters showed increased growth at the beginning of twenty-first century compared to similar stands (stands age = 40-60 years) at the end of nineteenth century. Mean height, dbh, and stem volume increased from 14 to 20 m, from 16 to 22 cm, and from approx. 63 to approx. 220 cu m/ha, respectively. Significant correlations were found between the stands mean height, dbh, and volume on the one hand, and vegetation period length (r(sub s) = 0.71 to 0.74), atmospheric CO2 concentration (r(sub s) = 0.71 to 0.76), and drought index (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, r(sub s) = \u22120.33 to \u22120.51) on the other hand. The results obtained have revealed apparent climate-induced impacts (e.g. increase of vegetation period length and birch habitat drying due to drought increase) on the stands growth. Along with this, a high correlation of birch biometric parameters and [CO2] in ambient air indicated an effect of CO2 fertilization. Meanwhile, further drought increase may switch birch stand growth into decline and greater mortality as has already been observed within the Trans-Baikal forest-steppe ecotone.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "29", "submissionId": 20140017092, "issue": "5", "publisher": "Taylor and Francis", "id": "53acb1d0d66547eeb2253a4864d85a9b", "publicationName": "Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research", "publicationDate": "2014-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140017092.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140017092/downloads/20140017092.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140017092/downloads/20140017092.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140017092/downloads/20140017092.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
