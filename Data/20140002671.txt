Kennedy Space Center in Florida also known as "Swamp Works"\nwas the destination of my summer 2013 internship. During my internship, I participated in multiple projects\nwhile applying multiple different skill sets. I began with acquiring a list of projects that were assigned to me by my\nmentor Meredith Chandler and various others. I began working on the command center that houses and utilizes 4\nDell computers, each equipped with dual monitors. This command center would be used to operate \'Big Bin\', the\n120 ton regolith container, for use of controlling different rovers and cameras inside. The command center would\nalso display weather information and other necessary data, as well. I was also given a project to convert an old 70"\ntable into a blast shielded box to add an additional layer of protection to the Surface Systems engineers. Another\nproject that was assigned was a mobile hyper-wall with the ability for expansion. The hyper wall had to be\ncompletely designed and researched from scratch. I was asked to help research and program a nano drill given to us\nby the HoneyBee Robotics lab at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Finally, I created multimedia presentations\nfor the NASA Kick Start projects and other miscellaneous videos to post on social networking websites. This kept\nfollowers informed on the projects occurring in the Swamp Works lab.\n\nII. Project Backgrounds\nThe projects assigned to me utilized different skill sets and methodologies; each requiring special attention to\ndetail and understanding. This section of the report explores the starting information and background of each project\nattempted during this internship.\n\n1\n\nIntern, Surface Systems Office, KSC, University of Central Florida\nMechanical Engineer, Surface Systems Office, NE-S, KSC\n3\nManagement and System Analyst, Surface Systems Office, NE-S, KSC\n\n2\n\n2\n\nSummer 2013 Session\n\nNASA USRP - Internship Final Report\n\nA. Command Center\nTo begin housing experiments for the RASSOR rover prototype, the 120 ton regolith bin needed a central\ncommand center to track the experiments appropriately. Swamp Works was given retired Dell computers that were\noriginally placed in inventory; these computers were assigned to me for the use of creating the Central Command\nCenter. For terminal housing, I was given the option to either use salvaged command station units, or design a center\nmyself. The terminal units needed some cleaning and adjusting; however, I eventually decided to utilize the\nsalvaged units. With assistance from my mentor, I incorporated keyboards and mice in conjunction with the\nCommand Center. Each monitor and machine required only minor adjustments and assembly.\nB. Table Top Blast Shield\nI was assigned to create a table top blast shield to protect the engineers who test equipment that could be\npotentially harmful if malfunctioning were to occur. I designed the project in Creo-2 and measured the dimensions\non the table that will support the completed box. This was my crash course in engineering software and I was guided\nthrough the process by some of the engineers in my lab. Once the design was completed, Jason Schuler assisted me\nin ordering the appropriate materials and the build would take place once the parts had arrived . It was also proposed\nto use gas shocks to take the majority of the weight off of the hinges. The material used would be 80/20 aluminum\nand the build was estimated at approximately 1 week.\nC. Mobile Hyper-Wall\nA mobile hyper-wall would be a very valuable asset to have, to lend, and potentially even sell. I was assigned the\ntask of designing the structure, choosing and quoting materials, building hardware, configuring software, and other\nvarious tasks that would ultimately get the wall up and running. After design, hardware research was required to\nsupport hosting of the four monitor strips. Proper software was required to match up the correct display segments.\n80/20 aluminum building material was found to be sufficient in supporting the hyper-wall and lessened build time\nsignificantly. The build time for 5 units of hyper wall strips was estimated at I week.\n\nD. Nano Drill\nThe nano drill acquired from HoneyBee Robotics is unique in that it can reduce its x and y axis forces in order to\ndrill more efficiently in low gravity environments. HoneyBee provided an insight into the idea of what motion\ncontroller and OS we could utilize. The nano drill is a rotary percussive drilling instrument that can be attached to\nany platform or rover. I was tasked to assist Jason Schuler in research, design, and programming the drill itself.\nE. Media and Social Networking\nSuccessful outreach to social media can help educate the public along with creating a following for the lab. I was\nassigned to help my mentor with social networking projects, video recording for various projects, and creating an\noutreach program for the Swamp Works lab. When tasked with creating videos about the KickStart NASA program,\nwe created videos interviewing some of the engineers from multiple angles for a stronger and intimate video effect.\nWe were then able to load the clips into iMovie to edit them appropriately. We also sought to brainstorm a few ideas\non the promotion of the Swamp Works lab and initiating a weekly or bi-weekly video release about the projects in\nthe lab. Along with video creation, updating social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, was also partially\nassigned ..\nF. Miscellaneous Projects\nThroughout the internship, I was able to assist engineers with the construction of the regolith bin. I worked on\nthe Don/Doff area as well as the large dual bin doors that swivel with the use of hinges. I also printed components\nwith the 3D printer as needed. Any miscellaneous jobs the lab employees required were assigned to me including\npainting, cleaning, and other physical work ..\n\nill. Implementation\nThis section of the report consists of the methods used to construct and execute the planned operations. Pictures\nof works in progress are included.\n\nA.

I was informed the machines were freshly\nI\nformatted and contained no Operating Systems (OS). I then\n\\\nfound a suitable OS that is both open source and is able to\noperate the lab software required . Ubuntu 12.04 Linux based\nOS was open source and supported a multitude of lab software.\n--.\n1 installed the OS on each machine and created usemame and\npasswords respectively. I began cleaning the command\n"\nterminals and adjusting the dimensions to sufficiently store the Figure I. Table Four Compu ter Com Center.\n22" Dell monitors that were to be used for this project.

Once the installation portion of the project was complete, I began pairing each machine with two\nmonitors in their corresponding terminals. I then ran power from each monitor and tower to their appropriate power\nstrip. Two extension cords, secured with hazardous caution tape, were run from a nearby outlet across a path to\nultimately power up each terminal. Kennedy Space Center does not allow permanent extension cords for power;\ntherefore, a work order for power had to be placed and the need for installation of additional outlets was also\ndetermined. A guide to Linux was printed to inform the engineers how to operate each terminal.\n\n,...\n\n-\n\n-r\n.\n-\n\n\'\n\n\'~r\n\n.,\n\n\xc2\xb7-\xc2\xb7\n\n~\'\n\nB. Ta ble Top Blast Shield\nSafety of all engineers/employees at Swamp Works is critical. I\ntransformed an old table into a blast shield to serve as added protection\nwhile testing equipment that has potential for fai lure. I began designing\nthe project in the Creo-2 software and gained knowledge as the project\nprogressed. Before this design process I had no experience with any\nCAD software. Upon measuring the table, I found the dimensions to be\n72x35x25 (l*w*h) in inches. Figure 2 shows the CAD design of the\nbox shell. The build took place on the 8th of July and was completed\nthe following day. With guidance from some of the engineers in the\nlab, I was able to create the design and even set the densities of each\nmaterial to acquire an accurate final weight, which is approximately\nFigure 2.

Mobile Hyper-Wall\nThe prospect of a mobile hyper-wall would increase productivity\nand appeal of any lab. Our visions of a hyper-wall consisted of being\nmobile and have the potential to be mass-produced to create various\nsizes. The ability to attach and combine in that the entire wall could be\ntransported quickly, with ease, was important. The wall also had to be\nsturdy, light, and simplistic-looking.\nWith the design requirements understood, design of the hyper-wall\nbegan in the Creo2 software. 80/20 building material was determined\nto be sufficient due to the strength and weight properties of the PIN#\n1515 80/20 aluminum material. I also utilized 80/20 for brackets and\nFigure 3. Mobile Hyper-Wall. Design oj\nhinges.

Each stand is equipped with a wire chute to adequately handle the cords of the entire setup. It was also\nproposed to put a plate on the bottom so the computer tower can join into stand itself.\nI quoted five of the mobile hyper wall stands via a supp lier from Orlando. The first quote of the project came\nback at $3064.14. The cost of each stand would equate to $612 .83 (see Figure 6). This price was too hi gh, therefore,\n\n4\n\nSummer 20 13 Session\n\nNASA USRP - Internship Final Report\n\nl needed to find a cheaper supplier of\ncaster wheels and wire enclosures.\nJason\nSchuler and\nI began\nresearching casters and mounting\nplates on McMaster.com in order to\nfind more moderately priced items.\nAfter further research we settled on\ncasters and cord enclosures from\nMcMaster.com and lowered the final\nHyper-Wall.\nFigure 4.

Nano Drill\n"\nWe were provided with a nano drill and operating instructions from Honeybee ,. ...,.\n"\nn\nRobotics at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. This drill could be placed u \'\non a next-generation rover used for collection of ice and regolith. We would be Figure 6. Hyper-Wall Quote\nutilizing an Elmo Duo motion controller (Figure 7), the nano drill itself, and other Quote for 5 builds of mobile\ncomponents needed to network the drill to the computer. After attending a hyper-wall.\nteleconference and ordering the proper connectors for the motion controller\nassembly, we began doing research on how to get the drill up and running.\nProper connectors were ordered, and we began discussing the construction\nand operation of the drill itself. It would be a joint project with HoneyBee\nand would require their expertise; however, my internship completed before\nwe could further work the project.\nUMM\n\n16 3110\n\nE. Media and Social Networking\nSocial networking is an extremely effective way for educational Figure 7. Elmo Motion Controller.\noutreach of users who are interested in robotics and spacecraft. When The Elmo Duo motion controller was\ncombined with media, it creates an interactive showcase for individuals recommended by the HoneyBee\nwho follow the Swamp Works team. By working closely with my mentor Robotics lab.\nMeredith Chandler, we were able to design an effective, yet entertaining\noutreach program for the Swamp Works lab. We created mandatory explanation videos for the NASA Kick Start\nprogram. Utilizing the Swamp Works studio and the iMovie software, we were able to produce videos 2 minutes in\nlength about each of the Kick Start proposal.\nWe began discussing how to implement a weekly or bi-weekly video about the evennts at the Swamp Works\nlaboratory. Humorous and interesting media captures the viewer\'s attention and maintains it throughout the video.\nWe also discussed video length and export control issues; it would also be best to have an interview associated with\nrecorded green screen footage maximize time allowance.\nF. Miscellaneous Projects\nThroughout my time at Swamp Works I was tasked with miscellaneous projects that ranged from working on the\n\'Big Bin\' to cleaning the lab. Most of my miscellaneous projects dealt with construction and labor on the 120 ton\nLunar Regolith Bin.\nI was assisted in the building of the don/doff area with two other interns as one of my first projects for Swamp\nWorks. We began by laying out the 80/20 in its configuration and acquiring the proper brackets and bolts for the\ntask. After organizing the parts, we began the assembly; this took approximately one week to complete. We then\nbegan inserting the texan plexiglass material, which required proper squaring of the structure. A rubber gasket was\nalso added for dust-proofing, fo llowed by doors and handles.\n\n5\n\nSummer 2013 Session\n\nNASA USRP - Internship Final Report\n\nAfter don/doff assembly (Figure 8), there were other small tasks\nwith the bin including cleaning the bin, rolling out the cover tarp,\nand capping some of the 80/20 end pieces for aesthetic purposes. A\nshipment of additional 80/20 building material arrived we began\nlaying out the design for the two large bin doors. After laying the\nskeleton of the door we started assembling and squaring the project.\nLexan was inserted which required additional squaring\nmeasurements. Once the texan was secure we placed the rubber\ngasket for the dust proof seal and began on the next door. The total\ndoor assembly took approximately 2 days. Once both doors were\nassembled, we started the process of attaching them to the Big Bin.\nIt was challenging to raise the top door to the proper position, but Figure 8. Don/Doff\nFigure 9.

Conclusion\nEach project assigned was completed to the best of my ability. I successfully created a blast shield and mobile\nhyper-wall. The command center is up and running with Linux based operating systems. The Big Bin is now almost\nfully completed and the research on the nano drill is complete and is at its component building stage. The idea for\nsocial media educational outreach has been talked about and a plan has been constructed. My Surface Systems\nsummer internship has been incredibly fulfilling and educational. Before the internship began, I had never touched\nCAD software or even built the smallest structure. I can now call myself proficient with CAD software and have two\ndesigns and builds under my belt. I have also quoted building materials and hosted meetings. Working at NASA has\nalways been a dream of mine and I finally feel like I\'ve taken the first steps in making that dream come true.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI want to thank my mentor Meredith Chandler for everything she has done to help guide me through my\ninternship at the Swamp Works lab, and my unofficial mentor, Jason Schuler for answering a multitude of questions\nregarding Mechanical and Civil Engineering.
