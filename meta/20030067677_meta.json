Among the challenges of the project was the small size of the capsule that was going to be used in order to get the plane to Mars. With the planet's thin atmosphere, a plane would need to have large wings in order to fly efficiently. How could you package a large-winged plane in a small capsule?", "title": "Proof of Concept", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20030067677, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bauer, Jeffrey"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Dryden Flight Research Center", "location": "Edwards, CA, United States"}}, "id": "39249ea422f941b9bd59b138eee4139e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030067677, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030067677, "id": "2fd3e393ae3d4007a50c1658f64ad83b", "publicationName": "ASK Magazine, No. 13", "publicationDate": "2003-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030067672, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "ASK Magazine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030067677.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030067677/downloads/20030067677.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030067677/downloads/20030067677.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030067677/downloads/20030067677.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
