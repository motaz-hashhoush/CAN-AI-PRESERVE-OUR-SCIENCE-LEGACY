It may\nalso be used as an FM discriminator and as a universal impedance bridge.\n\t\n\nC c\t\n\xc2\xb1VP\t\n\n^\n\nD\n\nCcF\n\nD4JVd cl;7\t\n\n03\nCl\t\n\nD4\n\np\n\nVA\t\n\n0\n\nC2\n\nr\\J ; ------ ----- 7\nV2\t\n\nIV2IVP'VDC\n\nV5\n\nThe circuit in the diagram provides an improvement over other recently developed circuits in at least\none of the following respects: (1) The output is relatively independent of excitation frequency; (2) The\ncircuit sensitivity is greater and is independent of\nwaveform; (3) The circuit performs equally well with\neither capacitive-, resistive-, or inductive-type transducers; (4) The transducer may be conveniently\ngrounded; (5) The circuit also functions as a tuned\nfrequency discriminator by combining series or parallel inductors with C1 and C2.\n\nThe diodes in the circuit perform as switches which\nconduct current in sequence. A typical input voltage\nwaveform is also shown in the diagram; the waveform\nrepresents a sinusoidal excitation voltage and a positive DC output signal present on terminal A (the DC\nvoltage at B is negative). Assuming that the capacitances of the coupling capacitors C 0 are much greater\nthan C1 and C2, and that the circuit is unloaded, diode\nD1 conducts when the applied voltage is sufficient to\nproduce a forward bias condition and charges C1 to\nthe peak value' Vi while removing a quantity of\ncharge from C0 equal to V1C1. When the applied voltage decreases sufficiently, D 1 is turned off, and D3\nconducts as it becomes forward biased relative to the\nvoltage on C2; a peak value of v2 is impressed on C2\nthereby replacing a quantity of charge on C0 equal to\nV2C2. The net effect is that it appears as though a\ndifferential charge exists on C 0 that is proportional to\nthe charges on C1 and C2. However, for steady-state\nconditions, the net transfer of charge from C 0 is zero.\nSince the DC voltage component on C0 must then\nadjust to a level to satisfy the condition Qi = Q2, it\nfollows that V1C1 = V2C2. Also, it can be shown that\nthe voltages between terminals A and B is\n2(C1\xe2\x80\x94C2)\nV\t\nV9 \xe2\x80\x94V\t\n= C1+C2'\nthe terms in the voltage transfer function are identified in the diagram.\nExamination of the voltage transfer function suggests that if C1 and C2 are nearly equal and have identical temperature coefficients, temperature changes\nwill be self-canceling in the capacitive functions of\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
