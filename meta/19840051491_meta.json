Multiple layers of haze, varying in thickness from a few 10's to 100's of meters, were observed throughout the troposphere. A maximum concentration of aerosols was located between 600 and 800 mb. Distribution of the haze layers was associated with distinct meteorological boundaries. The characteristics of the haze changed in response to stages in the progression of a major Arctic haze episode. On March 17, 1983, the Arctic anticyclone was penetrated and its meteorological and aerosol properties determined.", "title": "Vertical and horizontal characteristics of Arctic haze during AFASP - Alaskan Arctic", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:43:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840051491, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schnell, R.
