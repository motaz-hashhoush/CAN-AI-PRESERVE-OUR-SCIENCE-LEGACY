Constantly increasing system power levels also require improved circuit\nprotective elements that will absorb the excess thermal\nenergy due to high fault or short circuit currents. The\n"one shot" operation of conventional fuses make their use\nundesirable in most remote type applications such as\nspace flight.\nThe Solution:\nA new circuit protective device, called the self-healing\nfuse. The self-healing fuse is a very fast-acting current\nlimiting device that provides current overload protection\nfor vulnerable circuit elements and then re-establishes the\nconduction path within a few milliseconds. This fuse can\nalso perform as a fast-acting switch to clear transient\ncircuit overloads. The self-healing fuse takes advantage of\nthe -large increase in electrical resistivity that occurs when\na liquid metal vaporizes.\nHow It\'s Done:\n\nThe self-healing fuse has a metallic conductor of cross\nsection and length appropriate to the current and voltage\nrating, much as is the case of any meltable-link fuse. The\nsignificant difference is that this conductor is a liquid\nmetal confined in a small channel within a mechanically\nstrong ceramic insulator. The liquid metal fills the fuse\nchannel and the flexible, spring-restrained end reservoirs.\nThe reservoirs provide the mechanical forces that return\nthe liquid to the channel after the fuse fires. The liquid\nused is mercury; however, sodium, potassium, or a\nsodium-potassium eutectic (NaK) also have desirable\nproperties for this application.\nWhen an overload occurs, the excess current rapidly\ngenerates a vapor bubble by heating the liquid metal in\nthe fuse channel. The resultant vapor pressure expels the\nremaining liquid metal into the reservoirs as a mercury arc\ndischarge is set up along the channel length. The metal\nvapor arc in the fuse channel dissipates the circuit energy\nat a low current level until the arc self-extinguishes or\n\nuntil a circuit switch or relay opens the faulted circuit. If\nthe fault is transient in nature, the fuse action should clear\nthe fault without any further action by any other\nprotective devices. Since the arc has an impedance.\nhundreds of times larger than that of the liquid, the fault\ncurrent level is limited to a value less than rated current.\nThe arc mode typically persists for a time on the order of\none millisecond. When the arc extinguishes, the flexible\nspring-loaded reservoirs return the liquid metal into the\nconduction channel, thus healing the fuse.\nWhen the fuse fires, very large explosive forces are\ngenerated in the closely confined fuse channel. To resist\nthese forces, the ceramic insulator is placed in heavy\ncompression by the external metal structure of the fuse.\nIn the design shown in the figure, the metal rings are\nshrunk-fit directly over the insulator ceramic. Other\nbasically similar methods of obtaining pre-compression of\nthe brittle insulator materials have been used, such as\nbrazing or glass molding the metal members over the\ninsulator.\nThe flexible end reservoirs are designed to perform\nthree vital functions: (1) to absorb the impact forces of\nthe liquid mercury being ejected from the channels\nwithout permanent distortion; (2) to return liquid\nmercury to the conducting channel after the arc extinguishes; and (3) to allow for thermal expansion and\ncontraction of the mercury. Therefore, a heavy spring and\nrestraint strap to hold the spring almost fully compressed\nare added to prevent permanent distortion of the diaphragm and to insure the required restoring forces.\nThe self-healing fuse uses commercially available\nsapphire, 998+% pure alumina, or high density beryllia of\n99.8+% purity for the fuse channels. The external rings\nare a nickel alloy with a thermal expansion coefficient\nslightly higher than the ceramic to allow the required\nprecompression during assembly. The flexible end bellows\nand fill tube are stainless steel. They are arc welded to a\nlip on the end rings. The fill tube, which is used to\nevacuate and fill the fuse with mercury, is internally\ncoated with silicon rubber to give a positive seal when\nflattened, folded, and crimped.\n\n(Continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

The response to overcurrent is directly proportional to\n12 t (current squared multiplied by a time interval) with\na current-time curve almost identical to that for an\nSCR. Thus the self-healing fuse can be easily designed\nto protect an SCR, or possibly other semiconductor\ndevices, over a wide range of overload conditions.\n2. Life tests were conducted demonstrating a capability\nof at least 500 operations with fuse ratings from 4 to\n40 amperes at 50 to 100 volts dc.\n3.
