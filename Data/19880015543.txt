The linear\nmotion shaft (11) is connected to a stationary or fixed\nhousing (12) and to a movable housing (26) where the\nmovable housing (26) is mechanically actuated through\nactuator mechanism (22,26) by either manual means (21)\nor motor means (20). The housings (12,26) are adapted\nto releasably receive a variety of jaw or pulling elements (28) adapted for clamping or prying action. The\nstationary housing (12) is adapted to be pivotally\nmounted to permit an angular position of the housing to\nallow the tool to adapt to skewed interfaces. The actuator mechanisms (22,23) is operated by through a gear\ntrain (19) to obtain linear motion of the actuator mechanism.\n13 Claims, 2 Drawing Sheets\n\nUS.
