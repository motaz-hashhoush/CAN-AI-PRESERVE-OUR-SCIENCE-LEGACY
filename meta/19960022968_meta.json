The EPA thruster produces thrust through the electrostatic acceleration of a moderately dense plasma. No accelerating electrodes are used and the specific impulse is a direct function of the applied discharge voltage and the propellant atomic mass. The goal of the present program is to demonstrate feasibility of the EPA thruster concept through experimental and theoretical investigations of the EPA acceleration mechanism and discharge chamber performance. Experimental investigations will include operating the test bed ion (TBI) engine as an EPA thruster and parametrically varying the thruster geometry and operating conditions to quantify the electrostatic plasma acceleration effect. The theoretical investigations will include the development of a discharge chamber model which describes the relationships between the engine size, plasma properties, and overall performance. For the EPA thruster to be a viable propulsion concept, overall thruster efficiencies approaching 30% with specific impulses approaching 1000 s must be achieved.", "title": "Electrostatic Plasma Accelerator (EPA)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T10:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960022968, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brophy, John R."}, "organization": {"name": "Electric Propulsion Lab., Inc.", "location": "Lancaster, CA United States"}}, "id": "cffb9b2844a14f729d8b740592262bb9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960022968, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aston, Graeme"}, "organization": {"name": "Electric Propulsion Lab., Inc.", "location": "Lancaster, CA United States"}}, "id": "d99c378a5849421d8e5319fced2b1a24"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960022968, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960022968, "id": "3efab79766fe4f4b92d120a1fb07ba2e", "publicationName": "Overview of the Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "publicationDate": "1989-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
