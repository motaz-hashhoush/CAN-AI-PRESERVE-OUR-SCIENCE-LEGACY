These were categorized into 16 different failure modes. Failure propagation diagrams were established. The state of the art of engine condition monitoring for in-flight sensors and between flight inspection technology was determined. For the 16 failure modes, the potential measurands and diagnostic requirements were identified, assessed and ranked. Eight areas are identified requiring advanced technology development.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820008299, "id": "1ce48b59c56a42abb40ef53641d427f2", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820008299.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820008299/downloads/19820008299.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820008299/downloads/19820008299.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820008299/downloads/19820008299.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
