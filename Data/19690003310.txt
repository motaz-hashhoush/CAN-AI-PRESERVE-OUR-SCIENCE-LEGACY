CRUIKSHANK\nAND\nNovember 11, 1967\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper summarizes laboratory measurements of the intensity of the 1.4 and 1.9 p water-vapor bands in support of\nairborne observations o the planets Venus and Mars.\nf\n\nTable l), the pressure of 200 mb or 15 cm is considered more representative than the average of\n1 0 mb.\n0\nFigure 2 reproduces the records obtained in\nlaboratory air at p = 70 cm with the water-vapor\ncontent determined with a wet- and dry-bulb thermometer and a variable air path. Each band is\ncharacterized by its three branches, the depths of\nwhich can be measured withcut much ambiguity\nand should not be dependent on the precise value\nof the spectral resolution. The results of these depth\nmeasures are shown graphically in Figure 3. The\ncentral (6) branch of tne 1.9 p band has been\nomitted since it cannot be used on Venus, owing\nto the strong COaband 012 and the solar Paschen\na line, which together obliterate the H 2 0 absorption.\nThe curves of growth in Figure 3 have a nearly\nparabolic shape for amounts in excess of 8-10 p\nof water vapor, i.e., the band intensity increases\napproxiiiiately as the square root of the abundance.\nThe 72 p points of Figure 2, though outside the\ndiagram, were measured and used in drawing the\ndashed curves of Figure 3. Even for smaller amounts\nsome curvature is ?resent. Since pressure broadening\nextends the linear part of the curve of growth, it\nfollows that pressure effects are present even for\nthese smaller amounts of water vapor, which is not\nsurprising in view of the width and spacing of the\n\nT\n\nhe Venus observations and moon comparisons\ndescribed in Comm. LPL No. 95 require an a p\n.\nproximate calibration of the 1 4 and 1.9 p bands of\nwater vapor so that the observed absorptions may\nbe converted to abundance. The calibrations must\nmatch the astronomicalspectra in resolution in order\nthat the measured absorptions refer to the same\nfeatures. Only a few laboratory spectra were obtained with the interferometer used in the observations of Venus and the moon before it was returned\nto Cambridge, Mass. These are reproduced in Figure 1. As noted in the legend, the spectra were obtained at the ambient pressure of 70 cm Hg so that\nthe absorption depths may be enhanced by pressure\nbroadening relative to the 200 mb atmospheric records. Record c is anduly noisy; records CI and 6 are\na good match f .r the astronomical records.\nAll othe. calibrations were made subsequent to\nthe return of the interferometer, using the A-spectrolrxer of LPL with a very wide slit so as to simulate the band resolution used in the interferometer.\nTwo sets of records were obtained, one at the ambient laboratory pressure (70.5 cm) and one at the\nreduced pressure of about 15 cm, corresponding to\nthe 200 mb atmospheric level from which the planetary observations were made. Since the water vapor\nhas a much smaller scale height than the atmosphere\nat large, even at that level (Comm. LPL No. 93,\n19 1\n\nG . P. K U I P E RA N D D. P.
