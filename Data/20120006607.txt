Currently available CMGs are too large and\nheavy, and available miniature CMGs do\nnot provide sufficient control authority\nfor use on practical satellites. This primarily results from the need to greatly\nincrease the speed of rotation of the flywheel in order to reduce the flywheel\nsize and mass. This goal was achieved by\nmaking use of a proprietary, space-qualified, high-speed (100,000 rpm) motor\ntechnology to spin the flywheel at a\nspeed ten times faster than other known\nminiature CMGs under development.\n\nNASA is supporting innovations in\npropulsion, power, and guidance and\nnavigation systems for low-cost small\nspacecraft. One of the key enabling\ntechnologies is attitude control mechanisms. CMGs are particularly attractive\nfor spacecraft attitude control since\nthey can achieve higher torques with\nlower mass and power than reaction\nwheels, and they provide continuous\ntorque capability that enables precision\npointing (in contrast to on-off thruster\ncontrol).\nThe aim of this work was to develop a\nminiature, variable-speed CMG that is\nsized for use on small satellites. To\nachieve improved agility, these space-\n\ncraft must be able to slew at high rate,\nwhich requires attitude control actuators that can apply torques on the order\nof 5 N\xc2\xb7m. The MVS-CMG is specifically\ndesigned to achieve a high-torque output with a minimum flywheel and system mass. The flywheel can be run over\na wide range of speeds, which is important to help reduce/eliminate potential\ngimbal lock, and can be used to optimize the operational envelope of the\nCMG.\nThis work was done by Steve Bilski, Robert\nKline-Schoder, and Paul Sorensen of Creare\nInc. for Goddard Space Flight Center.

Previous training tools have\ncaused shoulder injuries. This new version is more than 50 percent lighter [in\nwater, weight is 2.4 lb (\xe2\x89\x881.1 kg)], and can\noperate for a six-hour training session\nafter 30 minutes of prep for submersion.\n\nInnovations in the design include the\nuse of lightweight materials (aluminum\nand Delrin\xc2\xae), creating a thinner housing, and the optimization of internal\nspace with the removal of as much excess material as possible. This reduces\ntool weight and maximizes buoyancy.\nAnother innovation for this tool is the\napplication of a vacuum that seats the O-\n\nrings in place and has shown to be reliable in allowing underwater usage for\nup to six hours.\nThis work was done by Michael Liszka,\nMatthew Ashmore, Mark Behnke, Walter Smith,\nand Tod Waterman of ATK Spacecraft, Systems\nand Services for Goddard Space Flight Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1). GSC-16060-1\n\nHEXPANDO Expanding Head for Fastener-Retention\nHexagonal Wrench\nGoddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland\nThe HEXPANDO is an expandinghead hexagonal wrench designed to retain fasteners and keep them from being\ndislodged from the tool. The tool is intended to remove or install socket-head\ncap screws (SHCSs) in remote, hard-toreach locations or in circumstances\nwhen a dropped fastener could cause\ndamage to delicate or sensitive hardware. It is not intended for application\nof torque.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nThis tool is made of two assembled\nportions. The first portion of the tool\ncomprises tubing, or a hollow shaft, at a\nlength that gives the user adequate\nreach to the intended location. At one\nend of the tubing is the expanding\nhexagonal headfitting with six radial\nslits cut into it (one at each of the\npoints of the hexagonal shape), and a\nsmall hole drilled axially through the\ncenter and the end opposite the hex is\n\ninternally and externally threaded. This\nfitting is threaded into the shaft (via external threads) and staked or bonded\nso that it will not loosen. At the other\nend of the tubing is a knurled collar\nwith a through hole into which the tubing is threaded. This knob is secured in\nplace by a stop nut.\nThe second assembled portion of the\ntool comprises a length of all thread or\nsolid rod that is slightly longer than the\n\n5\n\nsteel tubing. One end has a slightly\nlarger knurled collar affixed while the\nother end is tapered/pointed and\nthreaded. When the two portions are assembled, the all thread/rod portion\nfeeds through the tubing and is\nthreaded into the expanding hex head\nfitting. The tapered point allows it to be\ndriven into the through hole of the hex\nfitting. While holding the smaller collar\non the shaft, the user turns the larger\n\ncollar, and as the threads feed into the\nfitting, the hex head expands and grips\nthe SHCS, thus providing a safe way to\ninstall and remove fasteners. The clamping force retaining the SHCS varies depending on how far the tapered end is\ninserted into the tool head.\nInitial tests of the prototype tool, designed for a 5 mm or # 10SHCS have resulted in up to 8 lb (\xe2\x89\x8835.6 N) of pull\nforce to dislodge the SHCS from the\n\ntool. The tool is designed with a lead-in\nangle from the diameter of the tubing to\na diameter the same as the fastener\nhead, to prevent the fastener head from\ncatching on any obstructions encountered that could dislodge the fastener\nduring retrieval.\nThis work was done by John Bishop of QinetiQ for Goddard Space Flight Center.

Such a stage typically has an \xe2\x80\x9celevation\xe2\x80\x9d stage having a horizontal axis\nmounted on an \xe2\x80\x9cazimuth\xe2\x80\x9d stage with a vertical axis. Both stages are often motorized.\nOptical communications transceivers\noften require two-axis motorized control,\nas when the communications link is between a ground station and an aircraft or\n\nsatellite. In such applications, the traditional azimuth-elevation stage has two important drawbacks: a \xe2\x80\x9cgimbal lock\xe2\x80\x9d exclusion zone at zenith and susceptibility to\npointing errors caused by backlash. Az-el\nstages in which the azimuth stage cannot\nrotate a full 360\xc2\xb0 have the additional\ndrawback of an azimuth exclusion zone.\nThe diagonal-axes stage described here\nmitigates or eliminates all of these problems. Instead of one vertical axis and one\n\nA design based on the Diagonal-Axes Stage principle. Motors are shown in red, wedge and intermotor block are shown in blue, and the payload hub is green. The box at left with three circular apertures is an example of an optical payload; the L-bracket at left is a mounting bracket supporting the\nstage. Direction of travel is right-to-left.\n\n6\n\nhorizontal axis, a diagonal-axes stage has\ntwo horizontal axes, both oriented at 45\xc2\xb0\nto the trajectory of the target. For example, a ground station located on the equator tracking a satellite with an equatorial\norbit would have one axis parallel to\nnortheast and southwest, and the other\naxis parallel to northwest and southeast.\nThe diagonal-axes stage is considerably\nless vulnerable to backlash. If it is correctly\noriented, its axes rotate in only one direction during an overhead pass by a satellite.\nAs a result, the effects of backlash may be\ninherently eliminated. If the gravity-induced torque on either axis changes during the pass, then backlash may become important during the part of the pass where\nthe gravity torque, instead of opposing the\nmotion of the stage, pushes the stage in the\ndirection of motion. This can result in the\nloss of gear-to-gear contact in one or more\nstages of the gear reduction mechanism. In\nthis case, a preload spring used to eliminate\nbacklash need only be sufficiently strong to\novercome the gravity torque, i.e. it need not\novercome friction in the gear train.\nThe diagonal-axes stage is not backlashfree for arbitrary target trajectories such\nas an aircraft might execute. If properly\noriented for any particular satellite, however, it is backlash-free for all passes of that\nsatellite, which will trace out parallel paths\non the sky, and for all passes of any other\nsatellite that are perpendicular to the first.\nIt will also be backlash-free for some fraction of other satellite trajectories.\nThis work was done by Martin W. Regehr\nand Vachik Garkanian of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory. Further information\nis contained in a TSP (see page 1). NPO47427\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nElectronics/Computers\nImprovements in Speed and Functionality of a 670-GHz\nImaging Radar\nImage acquisition time has been reduced, enabling clearer images of contraband objects\nhidden underneath clothing.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nSignificant improvements have been\nmade in the instrument originally described in a prior NASA Tech Briefs article:\n\xe2\x80\x9cImproved Speed and Functionality of a\n580-GHz Imaging Radar\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-45156),\nVol. 34, No. 7 (July 2010), p. 51. First, the\nwideband YIG oscillator has been replaced with a JPL-designed and built\nphase-locked, low-noise chirp source.\nSecond, further refinements to the data\nacquisition and signal processing software have been performed by moving\ncritical code sections to C code, and compiling those sections to Windows DLLs,\nwhich are then invoked from the main\nLabVIEW executive.\nThis system is an active, single-pixel\nscanned imager operating at 670 GHz.\nThe actual chirp signals for the RF and\nLO chains were generated by a pair of\nMITEQ 2.5\xe2\x80\x933.3 GHz chirp sources. Agilent benchtop synthesizers operating at\nfixed frequencies around 13 GHz were\nthen used to up-convert the chirp\nsources to 15.5\xe2\x80\x9316.3 GHz. The resulting\nsignals were then multiplied 36 times by\n\na combination of off-the-shelf millimeter-wave components, and JPL-built 200GHz doublers and 300- and 600-GHz\ntriplers. The power required to drive the\nsubmillimeter-wave multipliers was provided by JPL-built W-band amplifiers.\nThe receive and transmit signal paths\nwere combined using a thin, high-resistivity silicon wafer as a beam splitter.\nWhile the results at present are encouraging, the system still lacks sufficient speed to be usable for practical\napplications in a contraband detection.\nIdeally, an image acquisition speed of\nten seconds, or a factor of 30 improvement, is desired. However, the system\nimprovements to date have resulted in\na factor of five increase in signal acquisition speed, as well as enhanced signalprocessing algorithms, permitting\nclearer imaging of contraband objects\nhidden underneath clothing. In particular, advances in three distinct areas\nhave enabled these performance enhancements: base source phase noise\nreduction, chirp rate, and signal pro-\n\ncessing. Additionally, a second pixel was\nadded, automatically reducing the imaging time by a factor of two. Although\nadding a second pixel to the system\ndoubles the amount of submillimeter\ncomponents required, some savings in\nmicrowave hardware can be realized by\nusing a common low-noise source.\nThis work was done by Robert J.

New missions that require\nhigh-speed downlink-only use of DTN\ncan now be accommodated by the unidirectional IONAC-Lite to support high\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\ndata rate downlink mission applications. Due to constrained energy resources, a conventional software implementation of the DTN protocol can\nprovide only limited throughput for\nany given reasonable energy consumption rate. The IONAC-Lite DTN Protocol Accelerator is able to reduce this energy consumption by an order of\nmagnitude and increase the throughput capability by two orders of magnitude. In addition, a conventional DTN\nimplementation requires a bundle database with a considerable storage re-\n\nquirement. In very high downlink datarate missions such as near-Earth radar\nscience missions, the storage space utilization needs to be maximized for science data and minimized for communications protocol-related storage needs.\nThe IONAC-Lite DTN Protocol Accelerator is implemented in a reconfigurable hardware device to accomplish\nexactly what\xe2\x80\x99s needed for high-throughput DTN downlink-only scenarios.\nThe following are salient features of\nthe IONAC-Lite implementation:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An implementation of the Bundle Pro-\n\n7\n\ntocol for an environment that requires\na very high rate bundle egress data\nrate. The C&DH (command and data\nhandling) subsystem is also expected\nto be very constrained so the interaction with the C&DH processor and the\ntemporary storage are minimized.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fully pipelined design so that bundle\nprocessing database is not required.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Implements a lookup table-based approach to eliminate multi-pass process-\n\ning requirement imposed by the Bundle Protocol header\xe2\x80\x99s length field structure and the SDNV (self-delimiting numeric value) data field formatting.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 8-bit parallel datapath to support high\ndata-rate missions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reduced resource utilization implementation for missions that do not require custody transfer features. There\nwas no known implementation of the\nDTN protocol in a field programmable\n\ngate array (FPGA) device prior to the\ncurrent implementation.\nThe combination of energy and performance optimization that embodies\nthis design makes the work novel.\nThis work was done by Jordan L. Torgerson,\nLoren P. Clare, and Jackson Pang of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

GLISTIN will\ncollect ice topography measurement data\nover a wide swath with sub-seasonal repeat\nintervals using a Ka-band digitally beamformed antenna.\nFor technology demonstration purpose a receive array of size 1\xc3\x971 m, consisting of 160\xc3\x97160 radiating elements,\nwas developed. The array is divided into\n16 sticks, each stick consisting of 160\xc3\x9710\nradiating elements, whose outputs are\ncombined to produce 16 digital beams.\nA transmit array stick was also developed. The antenna arrays were designed\nusing Elliott\xe2\x80\x99s design equations with the\n\nuse of an infinite-array mutual-coupling\nmodel. A Floquet wave model was used\nto account for external coupling between radiating slots. Because of the use\nof uniform amplitude and phase distribution, the infinite array model yielded\nidentical values for all radiating elements but for alternating offsets, and\nidentical coupling elements but for alternating positive and negative tilts.\nWaveguide-fed slot arrays are finding\nmany applications in radar, remote sensing, and communications applications\nbecause of their desirable properties\nsuch as low mass, low volume, and ease\nof design, manufacture, and deployability. Although waveguide-fed slot arrays\nhave been designed, built, and tested in\nthe past, this work represents several advances to the state of the art. The use of\nthe infinite array model for the radiating\n\nslots yielded a simple design process for\nradiating and coupling slots. Method of\nmoments solution to the integral equations for alternating offset radiating slots\nin an infinite array environment was developed and validated using the commercial finite element code HFSS. For\nthe analysis purpose, a method of moments code was developed for an infinite array of subarrays.\nOverall the 1\xc3\x971 m array was found to\nbe successful in meeting the objectives\nof the GLISTIN demonstration antenna,\nespecially with respect to the 0.042\xc2\xb0,\n1/10th of the beamwidth of each stick,\nrelative beam alignment between sticks.\nThis work was done by Sembiam Rengarajan, Mark S.

NPO-47416\n\nDevelopment of a 150-GHz MMIC Module Prototype for LargeScale CMB Radiation\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nHEMT-based receiver arrays with excellent noise and scalability are already\nstarting to be manufactured at 100 GHz,\nbut the advances in technology should\nmake it possible to develop receiver\nmodules with even greater operation frequency up to 200 GHz. A prototype heterodyne amplifier module has been developed for operation from 140 to 170\nGHz using monolithic millimeter-wave\nintegrated circuit (MMIC) low-noise InP\nhigh electron mobility transistor\n(HEMT) amplifiers.\nThe compact, scalable module is centered on the 150-GHz atmospheric win-\n\n8\n\ndow using components known to operate\nwell at these frequencies. Arrays equipped\nwith hundreds of these modules can be\noptimized for many different astrophysical measurement techniques, including\nspectroscopy and interferometry.\nThis module is a heterodyne receiver\nmodule that is extremely compact, and\nmakes use of 35-nm InP HEMT technology, and which has been shown to have\nexcellent noise temperatures when\ncooled cryogenically to 30 K. This reduction in system noise over prior art has\nbeen demonstrated in commercial mixers (uncooled) at frequencies of\n\n160\xe2\x80\x93180 GHz. The module is expected\nto achieve a system noise temperature of\n60 K when cooled.\nAn MMIC amplifier module has been\ndesigned to demonstrate the feasibility\nof expanding heterodyne amplifier technology to the 140 to 170-GHz frequency\nrange for astronomical observations.\nThe miniaturization of many standard\ncomponents and the refinement of RF\ninterconnect technology have cleared\nthe way to mass-production of heterodyne amplifier receivers, making it a feasible technology for many large-population arrays.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nThis work furthers the recent research efforts in compact coherent receiver modules, including the development\nof\nthe\nQ/U\nImaging\nExperimenT (QUIET) modules centered at 40 and 90 GHz, and the pro-\n\nduction of heterodyne module prototypes at 90 GHz.\nThis work was done by Pekka P.

The analysis employs the method-of-moments solution\nto the pertinent coupled integral equations for the aperture electric field of all\nslots. In order to compute coupling between two arrays, the input port of the\nfirst array is excited with a TE10 mode\nwave while the second one is match-terminated. After solving the moment\nmethod matrix equations, the aperture\nfields of all slots are obtained and\n\nthereby the TE10 mode wave received at\nthe input port of the second array is determined. Coupling between two arrays\nis the ratio of the wave amplitude arriving in the second array port to the incident wave amplitude at the first array\nport. The coupling mechanism has been\nstudied as a function of spacing between\narrays in different directions, e.g. the\nelectric field plane, the magnetic field\nplane, and the diagonal plane. Computed coupling values are presented for\ndifferent array geometries.\n\nThis work is novel since it provides a\ngood understanding of coupling between waveguide-fed slot arrays as a\nfunction of spacing and orientation for\ndifferent aperture distributions and\narray architectures. This serves as a useful tool for antenna design engineers\nand system engineers.\nThis work was done by Sembiam Rengarajan of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Because\nthe price of a BOB is high, and no work\ncan be done without one, often the procedure stops, simply waiting for a BOB.\nA less expensive BOB would take less\ntime in the integration, testing, and\ntroubleshooting process.\nThe PCB-based BOB works and looks\nthe same as a standard JPL BOB, called\n\xe2\x80\x9cGold Boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d The only differences between the old BOB and the new PCBbased BOB is that the new one has 80 percent of its circuitry in a printed circuit\n\nboard. This process reduces the time for\nfabrication, thus making the BOBs less expensive. Moreover, because of its unique\ndesign, the new BOBs can be easily assembled and fixed. About 80 percent of the\nnew PCB-based BOB is in a $22 (at the\ntime of this reporting) custom-designed,\nyet commercially available PCB.\nThis device has been used successfully\nto verify that BOB cables were properly\nmade. Also, upon completion, the BOB\nwas beeped out via a multimeter to ensure that all sockets on the connectors\nwere properly connected to the respective banana jack.\n\nWhen compared to the Gold Box\nBOBs, the new BOB has many advantages. It is much more cost efficient, it\ndelivers equal usability at substantially\nlower cost of the BOB, and the Gold Box\nis much heavier when compared to the\nnew BOB. The new BOB is also a bit\nlonger and much more versatile in that\nconnectors are easily changeable and if a\nbanana jack is broken, it can be replaced\ninstead of throwing away an entire BOB.\nThis work was done by Jason H.

NPO-46799\n\nMultiple-Beam Detection of Fast Transient Radio Sources\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA method has been designed for using\nmultiple independent stations to discriminate fast transient radio sources\nfrom local anomalies, such as antenna\nnoise or radio frequency interference\n(RFI). This can improve the sensitivity of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nincoherent detection for geographically\nseparated stations such as the very long\nbaseline array (VLBA), the future square\nkilometer array (SKA), or any other coincident observations by multiple separated receivers.\n\nThe transients are short, broadband\npulses of radio energy, often just a few\nmilliseconds long, emitted by a variety\nof exotic astronomical phenomena.\nThey generally represent rare, highenergy events making them of great\n\n9\n\nscientific value. For RFI-robust adaptive detection of transients, using multiple stations, a family of algorithms\nhas been developed. The technique\nexploits the fact that the separated stations constitute statistically independent samples of the target. This can be\nused to adaptively ignore RFI events\nfor superior sensitivity. If the antenna\nsignals are independent and identically distributed (IID), then RFI\nevents are simply outlier data points\nthat can be removed through robust\nestimation such as a trimmed or Winsorized estimator.\n\nThe alternative \xe2\x80\x9ctrimmed\xe2\x80\x9d estimator\nis considered, which excises the\nstrongest n signals from the list of shortbeamed intensities. Because local RFI is\nindependent at each antenna, this interference is unlikely to occur at many antennas on the same step. Trimming the\nstrongest signals provides robustness to\nRFI that can theoretically outperform\neven the detection performance of the\nsame number of antennas at a single\nsite. This algorithm requires sorting the\nsignals at each time step and dispersion\nmeasure, an operation that is computationally tractable for existing array sizes.\n\nAn alternative uses the various stations\nto form an ensemble estimate of the\nconditional density function (CDF) evaluated at each time step. Both methods\noutperform standard detection strategies on a test sequence of VLBA data,\nand both are efficient enough for deployment in real-time, online transient\ndetection applications.\nThis work was done by David R.

JPL\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of\nRAMS gateway functionality is integrated with the ION (Interplanetary\nOverlay Network) implementation of\nthe DTN (Delay-Tolerant Networking)\nbundle protocol, and with JPL\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of AMS itself. RAMS protocol\ndata units are encapsulated in ION bundles and are forwarded to the neighboring RAMS gateways identified in the\nsource gateway\xe2\x80\x99s AMS management information base.\nEach RAMS gateway has interfaces in\ntwo communication environments: the\nAMS message space it serves, and the\nRAMS network \xe2\x80\x94 the grid or tree of mutually aware RAMS gateways \xe2\x80\x94 that enables AMS messages produced in one\nmessage space to be forwarded to other\nmessage spaces of the same venture.\nEach gateway opens persistent, private\nRAMS network communication channels to the RAMS gateways of other message spaces for the same venture, in\nother continua. The interconnected\nRAMS gateways use these communication channels to forward message petition assertions and cancellations among\nthemselves. Each RAMS gateway subscribes locally to all subjects that are of\ninterest in any of the linked message\nspaces. On receiving its copy of a message on any of these subjects, the RAMS\ngateway node uses the RAMS network to\nforward the message to every other\nRAMS gateway whose message space\ncontains at least one node that has subscribed to messages on that subject. On\nreceiving a message via the RAMS network from some other RAMS gateway,\nthe RAMS gateway node forwards the\nmessage to all subscribers in its own message space.\nIn this way, the RAMS protocol enables\nthe free flow of published application\nmessages across arbitrarily long, deep\nspace links while protecting efficient use\nof those links: only a single copy of any\nmessage is ever transmitted on any\nRAMS network communication channel,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nno matter how many subscribers will receive copies when the message reaches\nits destination message space.\nNote that the nature of the RAMS\nnetwork communication channels depends on the implementation of the\nRAMS network. In order to communicate over the RAMS network for a given\nventure, each RAMS gateway must know\nthe RAMS network location \xe2\x80\x94 an endpoint in the protocol used to implement\nthe RAMS network (e.g., the DTN bundle protocol) \xe2\x80\x94 at which every other\nRAMS gateway for that venture receives\nRAMS network traffic. Again, this extension of the publish/subscribe model to\ninterplanetary communications is invisible to application nodes. Application\nfunctionality is unaffected by these details of network configuration, and the\nonly effects on behavior are those that\nare intrinsic to variability in message\npropagation latency.\nThis work was done by Shin-Ywan Wang\nof Caltech and Scott C.

These tie\npoints are used to create a mosaic whose\nseams (boundaries of input images)\nhave been geometrically corrected to reduce or eliminate errors and mis-registrations. The methods used to find appropriate tie points for use in creating a\nmosaic are unique, having been designed to work in concert with the\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARSNAV\xe2\x80\x9d program to be most effective in reducing or eliminating geometric seams in a mosaic.\nThe program takes the input images\nand finds overlaps according to the\n\nnominal pointing. It then finds the most\ninteresting areas using a scene activity\nmetric. Points with higher scene activity\nare more likely to correlate successfully\nin the next step. It then uses correlation\ntechniques to find matching points in\nthe overlapped image. Finally, it performs a series of steps to reduce the\nnumber of tie points to a manageable\nlevel. These steps incorporate a number\nof heuristics that have been devised\nusing experience gathered by tie pointing mosaics manually during MER operations.

The\ntranslations are measured using a Cross\nCorrelation Fourier transformation\nmethod in which the relative phase of\nthe two transformed images is fit to a\nplane. The measured translations are\nthen used to correct the inter-frame jitter of the image sequence.

One such\nmaterial is the p-type compound semiconductor Yb14MnSb11 (YMS), which\nhas been demonstrated to have one of\nthe highest ZT values at 1,000 \xc2\xb0C, the\ndesired operational temperature of\nmany space-based radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs).\nDespite the favorable attributes of the\nbulk YMS material, it must ultimately be\nincorporated into a power-generating\ndevice using a suitable joining technology. Typically, processes such as diffusion bonding and/or brazing are used\nto join thermoelectric materials to the\nheat collector and electrodes, with the\ngoal of providing a stable, ohmic contact\nwith high thermal conductivity at the required operating temperature.\nSince YMS is an inorganic compound\nfeaturing chemical bonds with a mixture\nof covalent and ionic character, simple\nmetallurgical diffusion bonding is difficult to implement. Furthermore, the Sb\nwithin YMS readily reacts with most metals to form antimonide compounds with\na wide range of stoichiometries. Although choosing metals that react to\nform high-melting-point antimonides\ncould be employed to form a stable reaction bond, it is difficult to limit the reactivity of Sb in YMS such that the electrode is not completely consumed at an\noperating temperature of 1,000 \xc2\xb0C. Previous attempts to form suitable metallization layers resulted in poor bonding,\ncomplete consumption of the metallization layer or fracture within the YMS\nthermoelement (or leg).\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nYb14MnSb11\n\nMo Foil\n\n~3 mm\nMetallized Yb14MnSb11 Leg, terminated on both ends with Mo layers.\n\nAn approach to forming a stable metallization layer to consolidated YMS\nparts or legs has been developed, however, using thin molybdenum foils. The\nfoil is diffusion bonded to the YMS part\nat temperatures above 900 \xc2\xbaC, under the\napplication of adequate pressure for several hours. Use of a thin foil eliminates\nthe fracture typically observed within\nYMS parts when thicker foils are used\n(induced\nby\nthermo-mechanical\nstresses) as seen in the figure. The metal\ncan be bonded prior to dicing of the legs\nfrom a hot-pressed/consolidated YMS\nform, or it can be bonded to a pre-cut\nleg of the correct geometry. The contact\nis thermally stable with respect to YMS,\nexhibiting no de-bonding or increase in\ncontact resistance after a 1,000 \xc2\xb0C vacuum heat treatment for 1,500 hours.\nThis metallization layer may then be\nbonded or brazed to other components,\nsuch as heat collectors or current-carrying electrodes. To enable successful\nbonding of the molybdenum metallization requires the preparation of YMS\nlegs of sufficient strength, which is facilitated by the hot pressing of YMS powders above 900 \xc2\xb0C (using proper cooling\n\nrates to minimize residual stress formation and avoid fracture of the parts).\nThis metallization layer may then be\nbonded or brazed to other components,\nsuch as heat collectors or current-carrying electrodes. Furthermore, it can be\nimplemented at both the hot and cold\nsides of the leg. It can also be applied as\na metallization layer to other similar\ncompositions of thermoelectric materials. The specific nature of the interaction between Mo and YMS is still under\ninvestigation; however, it is clear the\nmolybdenum reacts sufficiently to form\nan adequate bond, without the extensive\nreaction observed with similar metals\nsuch as nickel, niobium, or titanium.\nThe process may be similar to that involved in the formation of other\nmetal/ceramic bonds, wherein the\nmetal has limited solubility in the ceramic material (for example, in diffusion bonded metal/alumina joints).\nThis work was done by Samad Firdosy, Billy\nChun-Yip Li, Vilupanur Ravi, Jeffrey\nSakamoto, Thierry Caillat, Richard C.

Also, properties of scaffolds made by this technique are more\nreproducible than are properties of\ncomparable scaffolds made by traditional sintering.\nThe technique involves the use of two\nmiscible organic liquids: one that is and\none that is not a solvent for the affected\npolymer.

Specifically, this technology incorporates TiO2 coatings and materials\napplied to, or integrated as a part of, the\noptical surfaces of sensors and calibration sources, including lenses, windows,\nand mirrors that are used in remote, unattended, ground-based (land or maritime) optical sensor systems.\nCurrent methods used to address contamination or biofouling of these optical\nsurfaces in deployed systems are costly,\ntoxic, labor intensive, and non-preventative. By implementing this novel technology, many of these negative aspects\ncan be reduced. The functionality of this\n\ninnovative self-cleaning solution to address the problem of contamination or\nbiofouling depends on the availability of\na sufficient light source with the appropriate spectral properties, which can be\nattained naturally via sunlight or supplemented using artificial illumination such\nas UV LEDs (light emitting diodes).\nIn land-based or above-water systems,\nthe TiO2 optical surface is exposed to\nsunlight, which catalyzes the photocatalytic reaction, facilitating both the decomposition of inorganic and organic\ncompounds, and the activation of superhydrophilic properties. Since underwater\noptical surfaces are submerged and have\nlimited sunlight exposure, supplementary UV light sources would be required\nto activate the TiO2 on these optical surfaces. Nighttime operation of land-based\nor above-water systems would require this\naddition as well. For most superhy-\n\ndrophilic self-cleaning purposes, a rainwater wash will suffice; however, for some\napplications an attached rainwater collector/dispenser or other fresh water dispensing system may be required to wash\nthe optical surface and initiate the removal of contaminates. Deployment of\nthis non-toxic,non-hazardoustechnology\nwill take advantage of environmental elements (i.e. rain and sunlight), increase\nthe longevity of unattended optical systems, increase the amount of time between required maintenance, and improve the long-term accuracy of sensor\nmeasurements.\nThis work was done by Robert Ryan, Lauren\nUnderwood, and Kara Holekamp of Science\nSystems and Applications, Inc., George May of\nInstitute of Technology Development, and Bruce\nSpiering and Bruce Davis of Stennis Space\nCenter.

Partial separation\n(enrichment) according to bandgap\n(which is linked to polarizability) has also\nbeen shown and can be improved to full\nseparation of individual types of semiconducting SWNTs with better control over\noperational parameters and the length of\nSWNT starting material. This process and\ndevice can be scaled affordably to generate useful amounts of semiconducting\nSWNTs for electronic device development and production.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nIn this study, a flow injection dielectrophoresis technique was used with a\nmodified dielectrophoresis device. The\nlength, width, and height of the modified chamber were 28, 2.5, and 0.025\ncm, respectively. On the bottom of the\nchamber, there are two arrays of 50-\xc2\xb5mwide, 2-\xc2\xb5m-thick gold electrodes, which\nare connected to an AC voltage generator and are alternately arranged so that\nevery electrode is adjacent to two electrodes of the opposite polar. There is an\nadditional plate electrode on the top of\nthe chamber that is negatively biased.\nDuring the experiment, a syringe\npump constantly pumps in the mobile\nphase, 1-percent sodium dodecylbenzene\nsulfonate (SDBS) solution, into the\nchamber. The frequency and voltage are\nset to 1 MHz and 10 V peak-to-peak, re-\n\nspectively. About 150 \xc2\xb5L of SWNTs in 1percent SDBS decanted solution are injected to the mobile phase through a septum near the entrance of the chamber.\nThe flow rate of the mobile phase is set to\n0.02 cm3/min. The injected SWNTs sample flows through the chamber before it\nis lead into a fluorescence flow-through\ncell and collected for further analysis.\nThe flow-through cell has three windows,\nthus allowing the fluorometer to collect\nfluorescence spectrum and visible absorption spectrums simultaneously.\nDielectrophoresis field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF) generally depends on\ninteraction of a sedimentation force\nand DEP force for particle separation,\nand SWNTs are neutrally buoyant in\nwater. In this innovation, the third\nelectrode was added to create a sedi-\n\n17\n\nmentation force based on DC electrophoresis. This makes this particular\ndevice applicable to separations on any\nneutrally buoyant particles in solution\nand a more general process for a\nbroad range of nanomaterials sorting\nand separations.\nThis work was done by Howard K.

The resulting shorter DNA\nstrands (<400 bp) constitute a library of\nDNA fragments with defined 3\xe2\x80\x99 and 5\xe2\x80\x99 termini. Specific primers to these termini are\nthen used to isothermally amplify this library into potentially unlimited quantities\nthat can be used immediately for multiple\ndownstream applications including gel\neletrophoresis, quantitative polymerase\nchain reaction (QPCR), comparative genomic hybridization microarray, SNP\nanalysis, and sequencing.\nThe standard reaction can be performed with minimal hands-on time,\nand can produce amplified DNA in as\nlittle as three hours. Post-fragmentation\nwhole genome amplification-based technology provides a robust and accurate\nmethod of amplifying femtogram levels\nof starting material into microgram\nyields with no detectable allele bias. The\namplified DNA also facilitates the\npreservation of samples (spacecraft samples) by amplifying scarce amounts of\ntemplate DNA into microgram concen-\n\ntrations in just a few hours. Based on further optimization of this technology, this\ncould be a feasible technology to use in\nsample preservation for potential future\nsample return missions.\nThe research and technology development described here can be pivotal in\ndealing with backward/forward biological contamination from planetary missions. Such efforts rely heavily on an increasing understanding of the burden\nand diversity of microorganisms present\non spacecraft surfaces throughout assembly and testing.\nThe development and implementation of these technologies could significantly improve the comprehensiveness\nand resolving power of spacecraft-associated microbial population censuses, and\nare important to the continued evolution and advancement of planetary protection capabilities. Current molecular\nprocedures for assaying spacecraft-associated microbial burden and diversity\nhave inherent sample loss issues at practically every step, particularly nucleic\nacid extraction. In engineering a molecular means of amplifying nucleic acids\ndirectly from single cells in their native\n\nstate within the sample matrix, this innovation has circumvented entirely the\nneed for DNA extraction regimes in the\nsample processing scheme.\nAs typically 90 percent of the biomaterial held within a sample is lost at the extraction step, the absence of DNA extraction in processing a sample of low\nbiomass is quite appealing and seemingly superior, at least in theory. If current understanding of spacecraft-associated microbial burden/diversity is based\non a mere 10% of the actual sample collected, then a much broader diversity\nand elevated bioburden should be able\nto be resolved upon mitigating this \xe2\x89\x88\n90% loss of sample biomatter. This innovative process should lend considerable\ncredence to such assays, and ultimately\nresult in a much more comprehensive\nknowledge base of the abundance and\nphylogenetic diversity of microbes on\nand around spacecraft surfaces.\nThis work was done by James (Nick) Benardini and Myron T.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA novel approach for the immediate\nsealing of traumatic wounds is under development. A portable microwave generator and handheld antenna are used to seal\nwounds, binding the edges of the wound\ntogether using a biodegradable protein\nsealant or \xe2\x80\x9csolder.\xe2\x80\x9d This method could be\nused for repairing wounds in emergency\nsettings by restoring the wound surface to\nits original strength within minutes. This\ntechnique could also be utilized for surgical purposes involving solid visceral organs\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\n(i.e., liver, spleen, and kidney) that currently do not respond well to ordinary surgical procedures.\nA miniaturized microwave generator\nand a handheld antenna are used to deliver microwave energy to the protein\nsolder, which is applied to the wound.\nThe antenna can be of several alternative designs optimized for placement either in contact with or in proximity to\nthe protein solder covering the wound.\nIn either case, optimization of the de-\n\nsign includes the matching of impedances to maximize the energy delivered\nto the protein solder and wound at a\nchosen frequency. For certain applications, an antenna could be designed that\nwould emit power only when it is in direct contact with the wound.\nThe optimum frequency or frequencies for a specific application would depend on the required depth of penetration of the microwave energy. In fact, a\ncomputational simulation for each spe-\n\n19\n\ncific application could be performed,\nwhich would then match the characteristics of the antenna with the protein solder and tissue to best effect wound closure. An additional area of interest with\npotential benefit that remains to be validated is whether microwave energy can\neffectively kill bacteria in and around\nthe wound. Thus, this may be an efficient method for simultaneously sterilizing and closing wounds.\nUsing microwave energy to seal\nwounds has a number of advantages\nover lasers, which are currently in experimental use in some hospitals. Laser tissue welding is unsuitable for emergency\nuse because its large, bulky equipment\ncannot be easily moved between operat-\n\ning rooms, let alone relocated to field\nsites where emergencies often occur. In\naddition, this approach is highly dependent on the uniformity and thickness of the protein solder as well as the\nsurgeon\xe2\x80\x99s skills. In contrast, the use of\nmicrowave energy is highly tolerant of\nthe thickness of the protein solder, level\nof fluids in and around the wound, and\nother parameters that can adversely affect the outcome of laser welding. However, controlling the depth of penetration of the microwave energy into the\nwound is critical for achieving effective\nwound sealing without damaging the adjacent tissue. In addition, microspheres\nthat encapsulate metallic cores could\nalso be incorporated into the protein\n\nsolder to further control the depth of\npenetration of the microwave energy.\nThis work was performed by G.

Building microfluidics to suit a particular tissue\nsample would allow the rapid, reliable,\ninexpensive, highly parallelized, selective extraction of chosen regions of tissue for purposes of further biochemical\nanalysis. Furthermore, the applicability\nof the techniques ranges beyond the described pathology application. For example, they would also allow the posing\nand successful answering of new sets of\nquestions in many areas of fundamental\nresearch.\nThe proposed integration of microfluidic techniques and tissue slice\nsamples is called \xe2\x80\x9ctissue microfluidics\xe2\x80\x9d\nbecause it molds the microfluidic architectures in accordance with each\nparticular structure of each specific tissue sample. Thus, microfluidics can be\nbuilt around the tissues, following the\ntissue structure, or alternatively, the\nmicrofluidics can be adapted to the\nspecific geometry of particular tissues.\nBy contrast, the traditional approach is\nthat microfluidic devices are structured in accordance with engineering\nconsiderations, while the biological\ncomponents in applied devices are\nforced to comply with these engineering presets.\nThe proposed principles represent a\nparadigm shift in microfluidic technol-\n\n20\n\nogy in three important ways:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Microfluidic devices are to be directly\nintegrated with, onto, or around tissue\nsamples, in contrast to the conventional method of off-chip sample extraction followed by sample insertion\nin microfluidic devices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Architectural and operational principles of microfluidic devices are to be\nsubordinated to suit specific tissue\nstructure and needs, in contrast to the\nconventional method of building devices according to fluidic function\nalone and without regard to tissue\nstructure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Sample acquisition from tissue is to be\nperformed on-chip and is to be integrated with the diagnostic measurement within the same device, in contrast to the conventional method of\noff-chip sample prep and subsequent\ninsertion into a diagnostic device. A\nmore advanced form of tissue integration with microfluidics is tissue encapsulation, wherein the sample is completely\nencapsulated\nwithin\na\nmicrofluidic device, to allow for full\nsurface access.\nThe immediate applications of these\napproaches lie with diagnostics of tissue\nslices and biopsy samples \xe2\x80\x94 e.g. for cancer \xe2\x80\x94 but the approaches would also be\nvery useful in comparative genomics and\nother areas of fundamental research involving heterogeneous tissue samples.\n\nThe approach advocates and utilizes\nthe bottom-up customization of microfluidic architectures to biosamples,\nin contrast to the traditional top-down\napproach of building the architectures\nfirst and then putting the biosamples inside. Further, as particular embodiments\nof the above principle, novel techniques\nof sub-sample selection and isolation are\npresented. These techniques would have\nwide applicability in fundamental research and biomedical diagnostics.\nIn particular, an in situ microfluidic\ntechnique of single-cell isolation, or\nmultiple single-cell isolations, is described, and is performed upon tissue\nsections attached to pathology glass\nslides. The technique combines the advantages of preserving the architectural integrity of the tissue section\nwhile allowing flexibility and precision\nof cell selection, rapid prototyping,\nand enhanced sample purity, while\nbenefiting from the experience of the\npathologist in the selection process.\nThe result is a system that would allow\nthe rapid and reliable biochemical\nanalysis and diagnosis of pathologic\nprocesses with sensitivity extended\ndown to the level of even a single cell,\nwith high levels of confidence in the diagnostic determination.\nThese techniques would allow the extraction of cells and cell nuclei chosen\nfor their potentially pathologic origin,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\ne.g. cancer. The chief advantages of the\nproposed methods are their speed, ease,\nreliability, and capacity to select individual cells from a tissue slice population\nwith a higher degree of purity and specificity. The result is the extracted DNA\ncan be biochemically analyzed with a\nhigher degree of diagnostic accuracy, as\nthe isolated sub-sample would not be diluted by unwanted material from the\nambient tissue. In comparison to other\n\ntechniques, the proposed methods\nwould combine high specificity with\nhigh speed.\nThis work was done by Lawrence A. Wade\nof Caltech and Emil P.

TE is seen\nas a future solution to solve the crisis of\ndonor organs for transplant, which faces\na shortage expected only to increase in\nthe future. In this innovation, a flexible\nand configurable scaffold has been conceived that mechanically stresses cells\nthat are seeded on it, stimulating them\nto increased growth.\nThe influence of mechanical stress/\nloading on cell growth has been observed on all forms of cells. For example, for cartilages, studies in animals, tissue explants, and engineered tissue\nscaffolds have all shown that cartilage\ncells (chondrocytes) modify their extracellular matrix in response to loading.\nThe chondrocyte EMC production re-\n\nsponse to dynamics of the physical environment (in vivo cartilage development) illustrates a clear benefit (better\ngrowth) when stressed. It has been\nshown that static and dynamic compression regulates PRG4 biosynthesis by cartilage explants.\nMechanical tissue stimulation is beneficial and (flexible) scaffolds with movable components, which are able to induce mechanical stimulation, offer\nadvantages over the fixed, rigid scaffold\ndesign. In addition to improved cell\ngrowth from physical/mechanical stimulation, additional benefits include the\nability to increase in size while preserving shape, or changing shape.\nBy making scaffolds flexible, allowing\nrelative movement between their components, adding sensing (e.g., for de-\n\ntecting response of cells to drug release\nand to mechanical actions), building\ncontrols for drug release and movement, and building even simple algorithms for mapping sensing to action,\nthese structures can actually be made\ninto biocompatible and biodegradable\nrobots. Treating them as robots is a perspective shift that may offer advantages\nin the design and exploitation of these\nstructures of the future.\nThis work was done by Adrian Stoica of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA process has been developed that can\nconfer novel properties, such as metal resistance, to a host bacterium. This same\nprocess can also be used to produce\nRNAs and peptides that have novel properties, such as the ability to bind particular compounds. It is inherent in the\nmethod that the peptide or RNA will behave as expected in the target organism.\nPlasmid-born mini-gene libraries coding\nfor either a population of combinatorial\npeptides or stable, artificial RNAs carrying random inserts are produced. These\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nlibraries, which have no bias towards any\nbiological function, are used to transform the organism of interest and to\nserve as an initial source of genetic variation for stress-driven evolution.\nThe transformed bacteria are propagated under selective pressure in order\nto obtain variants with the desired properties. The process is highly distinct\nfrom in vitro methods because the variants are selected in the context of the\ncell while it is experiencing stress.\nHence, the selected peptide or RNA will,\n\nby definition, work as expected in the\ntarget cell as the cell adapts to its presence during the selection process. Once\nthe novel gene, which produces the\nsought phenotype, is obtained, it can be\ntransferred to the main genome to increase the genetic stability in the organism. Alternatively, the cell line can be\nused to produce novel RNAs or peptides\nwith selectable properties in large quantity for separate purposes. The system allows for easy, large-scale purification of\nthe RNAs or peptide products.\n\n21\n\nThe process has been reduced to practice by imposing sub-inhibitory concentrations of NiCl2 on cells of the bacterium Escherichia coli that were\ntransformed separately with the peptide\nlibrary and RNA library. The evolved resistant clones were isolated, and sequences of the selected mini-gene variants were established. Clones resistant to\nNiCl2 were found to carry identical plasmid variants with a functional mini-gene\nthat specifically conferred significant\nnickel tolerance on the host cells. Sequencing of the selected mini-gene revealed a propensity of the encoded peptide to bind transient metal ions.\nExpression of the mini-gene markedly\nimproved growth parameters of the\n\n22\n\nevolved clones at sub-inhibitory concentrations of NiCl2 while being slightly\ndetrimental in the absence of stress. Similar results have been obtained with the\nRNA libraries.\nOverall, the results demonstrate a very\nnatural outcome of the selection experiments in which the mini-genes were expected to be either successfully integrated into bacterial genetic networks,\nor rejected depending upon their effect\non host fitness. This described approach\ncan be useful as a laboratory model to\nstudy the dynamics of bacterial adaptive\nevolution on the molecular level. It can\nalso provide a strategy for screening expressed DNA libraries in search of novel\ngenes with desirable properties.\n\nThis work was done by George E. Fox, Victor G.

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA novel method has been developed\nfor performing very fine calibration of\na spectrometer. This process is particularly useful for modern miniature\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) spectrometers where a typical factory wavelength calibration has been performed\nand a finer, more accurate calibration\nis desired. Typically, the factory calibration is done with a spectral line\nsource that generates light at known\nwavelengths, allowing specific pixels in\nthe CCD array to be assigned wave-\n\nlength values. This method is good to\nabout 1 nm across the spectrometer\xe2\x80\x99s\nwavelength range. This new method\nappears to be accurate to about 0.1\nnm, a factor of ten improvement.\nWhite light is passed through an unbalanced Michelson interferometer,\nproducing an optical signal with significant spectral variation. A simple theory\ncan be developed to describe this spectral pattern, so by comparing the actual\nspectrometer output against this predicted pattern, errors in the wavelength\n\nassignment made by the spectrometer\ncan be determined.\nThe primary unique feature of this innovation is its ability to calibrate every\npixel across a given wavelength range as\nopposed to only calibrating a few pixels\nand interpolating the other values as is\ncurrently done.\nThis work was done by Stephen Simmons\nand Robert Youngquist of Kennedy Space\nCenter. Further information is contained in a\nTSP (see page 1). KSC-13331\n\nCatalytic Microtube Rocket Igniter\nThis device can also be used on commercial combustion devices such as furnaces, power\ngenerators, and gas-fueled cooking appliances like grills, ranges, and ovens.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nDevices that generate both high energy and high temperature are required\nto ignite reliably the propellant mixtures\nin combustion chambers like those present in rockets and other combustion systems. This catalytic microtube rocket igniter generates these conditions with a\nsmall, catalysis-based torch. While traditional spark plug systems can require\nanywhere from 50 W to multiple kW of\npower in different applications, this system has demonstrated ignition at less\nthan 25 W. Reactants are fed to the igniter from the same tanks that feed the\nreactants to the rest of the rocket or\ncombustion system. While this specific\nigniter was originally designed for liquid\nmethane and liquid oxygen rockets, it\ncan be easily operated with gaseous propellants or modified for hydrogen use in\ncommercial combustion devices.\nFor the present cryogenic propellant\nrocket case, the main propellant tanks\n\xe2\x80\x94 liquid oxygen and liquid methane, respectively \xe2\x80\x94 are regulated and split into\ndifferent systems for the individual\nstages of the rocket and igniter. As the\ncatalyst requires a gas phase for reaction,\neither the stored boil-off of the tanks can\nbe used directly or one stream each of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nfuel and oxidizer can go through a heat\nexchanger/vaporizer that turns the liquid propellants into a gaseous form. For\ncommercial applications, where the reactants are stored as gases, the system is\nsimplified. The resulting gas-phase\nstreams of fuel and oxidizer are then further divided for the individual components of the igniter.\nOne stream each of the fuel and oxidizer is introduced to a mixing\nbottle/apparatus where they are mixed\nto a fuel-rich composition with an O/F\nmass-based mixture ratio of under 1.0.\nThis premixed flow then feeds into the\ncatalytic microtube device. The total\nflow is on the order of 0.01 g/s. The microtube device is composed of a pair of\nsub-millimeter diameter platinum tubes\nconnected only at the outlet so that the\ntwo outlet flows are parallel to each\nother. The tubes are each approximately\n10 cm long and are heated via direct\nelectric resistive heating. This heating\nbrings the gasses to their minimum required ignition temperature, which is\nlower than the auto-thermal ignition\ntemperature, and causes the onset of\nboth surface and gas phase ignition producing hot temperatures and a highly\n\nreacting flame.\nThe combustion products from the\ncatalytic tubes, which are below the melting point of platinum, are injected into\nthe center of another combustion stage,\ncalled the primary augmenter. The reactants for this combustion stage come\nfrom the same source but the flows of\nnon-premixed methane and oxygen gas\nare split off to a secondary mixing apparatus and can be mixed in a near-stoichiometric to highly lean mixture ratio.\nThe primary augmenter is a component\nthat has channels venting this mixed gas\nto impinge on each other in the center\nof the augmenter, perpendicular to the\nflow from the catalyst. The total crosssectional area of these channels is on a\nsimilar order as that of the catalyst. The\naugmenter has internal channels that\nact as a manifold to distribute equally\nthe gas to the inward-venting channels.\nThis stage creates a stable flame kernel\nas its flows, which are on the order of\n0.01 g/s, are ignited by the combustion\nproducts of the catalyst. This stage is designed to produce combustion products\nin the flame kernel that exceed the autothermal ignition temperature of oxygen and methane.\n\n23\n\nWhile these combined components\nwill mix and produce a near stoichiometric flame with a temperature high\nenough to ignite the reactants in most\ncombustion devices, the overall mass\nflow rate and energy is still relatively\nlow. For the extreme conditions of igniting a cryogenic propellant chemical\nrocket, this total may not be enough to\nmaintain a flame in the adverse environment. To enable this operation, another\ngas phase stage called the secondary\naugmenter is added in series with the\nfirst two components. As more heat release is required, the mass flow rate is increased by an order of magnitude to\nmore than 0.1 g/s for this stage. The\nflows are kept separate, however, until\ninjected where they impinge and mix\nwithin this secondary augmenter. Again,\n\nthe flows are distributed via a manifold\nsystem then injected through ports that\nare sized more than an order of magnitude larger than the total port area of\nthe first two components. The mixture\nis kept fuel rich so that the temperature\nis regulated below the melting point of\nthe components. With the ignition of\nthis stage, a large stable torch is produced to ignite the cryogens.\nThe hardware is designed so that the\ntotal size of the device was similar to\nthat of a traditional spark plug. Likewise, the outlet of the igniter mimics\nthat of a spark plug in order to have it\nact as a direct replacement in combustion devices. In tests it functioned as\nsuch, lighting chambers with propellant flows an order of magnitude larger.\nOperation was demonstrated with back\n\npressures as low as 0.01 atmospheres up\nto approximately 10 atmospheres and\nin theory, these bounds could be wider.\nIgnition was demonstrated with reactant temperatures near chilled-in cryogenic conditions. This igniter serves as\na low-energy alternative to spark ignition and can operate as an ignition\nsource for a variety of commercial combustion devices.\nThis work was done by Steven J. Schneider\nand Matthew C. Deans of Glenn Research\nCenter.

Refer to LEW-18565-1.\n\nStage Cylindrical Immersive Display\nThis collaborative design environment enables design engineers to be immersed in a car or\nairplane, for example, to evaluate the designs of components.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nPanoramic images with a wide field of\nview intend to provide a better understanding of an environment by placing\nobjects of the environment on one seamless image. However, understanding the\nsizes and relative positions of the objects\nin a panorama is not intuitive and prone\nto errors because the field of view is unnatural to human perception. Scientists\nare often faced with the difficult task of\ninterpreting the sizes and relative positions of objects in an environment when\nviewing an image of the environment on\ncomputer monitors or prints. A\npanorama can display an object that appears to be to the right of the viewer\nwhen it is, in fact, behind the viewer.\nThis misinterpretation can be very\ncostly, especially when the environment\nis remote and/or only accessible by unmanned vehicles.\nA 270\xc2\xb0 cylindrical display has been developed that surrounds the viewer with\ncarefully calibrated panoramic imagery\nthat correctly engages their natural kinesthetic senses and provides a more accurate awareness of the environment. The\ncylindrical immersive display offers a\nmore natural window to the environment\nthan a standard cubic CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), and the\ngeometry allows multiple collocated users\nto simultaneously view data and share important decision-making tasks.\n\n24\n\nA CAVE is an immersive virtual reality\nenvironment that allows one or more\nusers to absorb themselves in a virtual\nenvironment. A common CAVE setup is\na room-sized cube where the cube sides\nact as projection planes. By nature, all\ncubic CAVEs face a problem with edge\nmatching at edges and corners of the\ndisplay. Modern immersive displays have\nfound ways to minimize seams by creating very tight edges, and rely on the user\nto ignore the seam. One significant deficiency of flat-walled CAVEs is that the\nsense of orientation and perspective\nwithin the scene is broken across adjacent walls. On any single wall, parallel\nlines properly converge at their vanishing point as they should, and the sense\nof perspective within the scene contained on only one wall has integrity. Unfortunately, parallel lines that lie on adjacent walls do not necessarily remain\nparallel. This results in inaccuracies in\nthe scene that can distract the viewer\nand subtract from the immersive experience of the CAVE.\nThe cylindrical display overcomes the\nproblem of distorted edges.

This eliminates the artifacts\nof a flat-walled CAVE where the viewing\nsurface varies in distance from the\nviewer wherever he or she may stand\n\nwithin it. The display is a curved rearprojected screen comprising three-quarters of a 12-ft-diameter (\xe2\x89\x883.7-m-diameter) cylinder.

The screen is about 6.5 ft (\xe2\x89\x882\nm) tall, and the height of the actual\nimage displayed on the screen is approximately 5 ft (\xe2\x89\x881.5 m). A single consumer\nvideo card outputs to three short-throw\nprojectors that are mounted behind the\nscreen. Each projector illuminates 90\xc2\xb0 of\nthe screen and overlaps slightly with an\nadjacent projector. The resolution of the\nentire cylindrical display is about\n3,500\xc3\x971,024 pixels.

In addition, numerous organizations that\nlaunch space experiments into low-Earth\norbit want to know the accumulated\natomic oxygen fluence that their materials or components have been exposed to.\nThe device is based on the erosion\nyield of pyrolytic graphite. It uses two\n12\xc2\xb0 inclined wedges of graphite that are\nover a grit-blasted fused silica window\ncovering a photodiode. As the wedges\nerode, a greater area of solar illumination reaches the photodiode. A refer-\n\n26\n\nence photodiode is also used that receives unobstructed solar illumination\nand is oriented in the same direction as\nthe pyrolytic graphite covered photodiode. The short-circuit current from the\nphotodiodes is measured and either sent\nto an onboard data logger, or transmitted to a receiving station on Earth. By\ncomparison of the short-circuit currents\nfrom the fluence-measuring photodiode\nand the reference photodiode, one can\ncompute the accumulated atomic oxygen fluence arriving in the direction\nthat the fluence monitor is pointing.\n\nThe device produces a signal that is\nlinear with atomic oxygen fluence using\na material whose atomic oxygen erosion\nyield has been measured over a period\nof several years in low-Earth orbit.\nThis work was done by Bruce A.

Non-Newtonian effects such as\ndeviation from classical thermodynamic\nas well as quantum-like properties have\nbeen analyzed.\nA self-supervised (\xe2\x80\x9cintelligent\xe2\x80\x9d) particle that can escape from Brownian mo-\n\ntion autonomously is introduced. Such a\ncapability is due to a coupling of the particle governing equation with its own Liouville equation via an appropriate feedback. As a result, the governing equation\nis self-stabilized, and random oscillations\nare suppressed, while the Liouville equation takes the form of the Fokker-Planck\nequation with negative diffusion. Non-\n\nNewtonian properties of such a dynamical system as well as thermodynamical\nimplications have been evaluated.\nThis work was done by Michail Zak of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFast iterative algorithms are often\nused for solving Method of Moments\n(MoM) systems, having a large number\nof unknowns, to determine current distribution and other parameters. The\nmost commonly used fast methods in-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nclude the fast multipole method (FMM),\nthe precorrected fast Fourier transform\n(PFFT), and low-rank QR compression\nmethods. These methods reduce the\nO(N) memory and time requirements to\nO(N log N) by compressing the dense\n\nMoM system so as to exploit the physics\nof Green\xe2\x80\x99s Function interactions.\nFFT-based techniques for solving\nsuch problems are efficient for spacefilling and uniform structures, but\ntheir performance substantially de-\n\n27\n\ngrades for non-uniformly distributed\nstructures due to the inherent need to\nemploy a uniform global grid. FMM or\nQR techniques are better suited than\nFFT techniques; however, neither the\nFMM nor the QR technique can be\nused at all frequencies.\nThis method has been developed to\nefficiently solve for a desired parameter\nof a system or device that can include\nboth electrically large FMM elements,\nand electrically small QR elements. The\nsystem or device is set up as an oct-tree\nstructure that can include regions of\nboth the FMM type and the QR type.\nThe system is enclosed with a cube at a 0th level, splitting the cube at the 0-th\nlevel into eight child cubes. This forms\ncubes at a 1-st level, recursively repeating\nthe splitting process for cubes at successive levels until a desired number of lev-\n\nels is created. For each cube that is thus\nformed, neighbor lists and interaction\nlists are maintained.\nAn iterative solver is then used to determine a first matrix vector product for\nany electrically large elements as well as\na second matrix vector product for any\nelectrically small elements that are included in the structure. These matrix\nvector products for the electrically large\nand small elements are combined, and a\nnet delta for a combination of the matrix vector products is determined. The\niteration continues until a net delta is\nobtained that is within the predefined\nlimits. The matrix vector products that\nwere last obtained are used to solve for\nthe desired parameter.

MGS characterizes\noptical systems by estimating the wavefront errors in the exit pupil using only\nintensity images of a star or other point\nsource of light. This innovative implementation of MGS significantly accelerates the MGS phase retrieval algorithm\nby using stream-processing hardware on\nconventional graphics cards.\nStream processing is a relatively new,\nyet powerful, paradigm to allow parallel processing of certain applications\nthat apply single instructions to multiple data (SIMD). These stream processors are designed specifically to support large-scale parallel computing on\na single graphics chip. Computation-\n\nally intensive algorithms, such as the\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT), are particularly well suited for this computing\nenvironment. This high-speed version\nof MGS exploits commercially available\nhardware to accomplish the same objective in a fraction of the original\ntime. The exploit involves performing\nmatrix calculations in nVidia graphic\ncards. The graphical processor unit\n(GPU) is hardware that is specialized\nfor computationally intensive, highly\nparallel computation.\nFrom the software perspective, a parallel programming model is used, called\nCUDA, to transparently scale multicore\nparallelism in hardware. This technology\ngives computationally intensive applications access to the processing power of\nthe nVidia GPUs through a C/C++ programming interface. The AAMGS (Accel-\n\nerated Adaptive MGS) software takes advantage of these advanced technologies,\nto accelerate the optical phase error characterization.

The new approach\nis expected to retain the fidelity of the\n\n28\n\nphysics while also being computationally efficient. Typically, only models for\nthe small-scale fluxes of momentum,\nspecies, and enthalpy are used to reintroduce in the simulation the physics\nlost because the computation only re-\n\nsolves the large scales. These models\nare called subgrid (SGS) models because they operate at a scale smaller\nthan the LES grid.\nIn a previous study of thermodynamically supercritical fluid disintegration and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nmixing, additional small-scale terms, one\nin the momentum and one in the energy\nconservation equations, were identified\nas requiring modeling. These additional\nterms were due to the tight coupling between dynamics and real-gas thermodynamics. It was inferred that if these terms\nwould not be modeled, the high densitygradient magnitude regions, experimentally identified as a characteristic feature\nof these flows, would not be accurately\npredicted without the additional term in\nthe momentum equation; these high\ndensity-gradient magnitude regions were\nexperimentally shown to redistribute turbulence in the flow. And it was also inferred that without the additional term in\nthe energy equation, the heat flux magnitude could not be accurately predicted;\nthe heat flux to the wall of combustion\ndevices is a crucial quantity that determined necessary wall material properties.\n\nThe present work involves situations\nwhere only the term in the momentum\nequation is important. Without this additional term in the momentum equation, neither the SGS-flux constant-coefficient Smagorinsky model nor the\nSGS-flux constant-coefficient Gradient\nmodel could reproduce in LES the pressure field or the high density-gradient\nmagnitude regions; the SGS-flux constant-coefficient Scale-Similarity model\nwas the most successful in this endeavor\nalthough not totally satisfactory. With a\nmodel for the additional term in the momentum equation, the predictions of\nthe constant-coefficient Smagorinsky\nand constant-coefficient Scale-Similarity\nmodels were improved to a certain extent; however, most of the improvement\nwas obtained for the Gradient model.\nThe previously derived model and a\nnewly developed model for the addi-\n\ntional term in the momentum equation\nwere both tested, with the new model\nproving even more successful than the\nprevious model at reproducing the high\ndensity-gradient magnitude regions. Several dynamic SGS-flux models, in which\nthe SGS-flux model coefficient is computed as part of the simulation, were\ntested in conjunction with the new\nmodel for this additional term in the\nmomentum equation. The most successful dynamic model was a \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d model\ncombining the Smagorinsky and Gradient models.\nThis work is directly applicable to simulations of gas turbine engines (aeronautics) and rocket engines (astronautics).\nThis work was done by Josette Bellan and\nEzgi Ta\xc5\x9fkino \xc4\x9flu of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

With this tropospheric correction, low-frequency errors can be removed from InSAR\nimages. Additionally, results show that\nfor days with high-quality ECMWF data,\nthe SBLM ZTD correction performs as\nwell as the GPS ZTD correction. Finally,\nthe tropospheric correction enabled\n\norbit correction, and by correcting for\nboth errors, the quality of the InSAR images increased significantly.\nBy correcting for the troposphere,\nother errors become visible. The main\ncontributor to the remaining errors is uncertainties with determining the satellite\norbit. Because the orbit error is now separated from the tropospheric error, the\n\norbit can be corrected for more accurately.\nThis work was done by Frank H. Webb,\nEvan F. Fishbein, Angelyn W.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA solution has been developed to the\nchallenges of computation of derivatives\nwith respect to geometry, which is not\nstraightforward because these are not\ntypically direct inputs to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver. To\novercome these issues, a procedure has\nbeen devised that can be used without\nhaving access to the mesh generator,\nwhile still being applicable to all types of\nmeshes. The basic approach is inspired\nby the mesh motion algorithms used to\ndeform the interior mesh nodes in a\nsmooth manner when the surface nodes,\nfor example, are in a fluid structure interaction problem. The general idea is to\nmodel the mesh edges and nodes as constituting a spring-mass system. Changes\nto boundary node locations are propa-\n\ngated to interior nodes by allowing them\nto assume their new equilibrium positions, for instance, one where the forces\non each node are in balance.\nThe main advantage of the technique\nis that it is independent of the volumetric mesh generator, and can be applied\nto structured, unstructured, single- and\nmulti-block meshes. It essentially reduces the problem down to defining the\nsurface mesh node derivatives with respect to the geometry parameters of interest. For analytical geometries, this is\nquite straightforward. In the more general case, one would need to be able to\ninterrogate the underlying parametric\nCAD (computer aided design) model\nand to evaluate the derivatives either analytically, or by a finite difference tech-\n\nnique. Because the technique is based\non a partial differential equation (PDE),\nit is applicable not only to forward mode\nproblems (where derivatives of all the\noutput quantities are computed with respect to a single input), but it could also\nbe extended to the adjoint problem, either by using an analytical adjoint of the\nPDE or a discrete analog.\nThis work was done by Sanjay Mathur of\nJabiru Software and Services, LLC, for Glenn\nResearch Center.

This method\nis designed for balloons in wind fields but\nmay be generalized for any buoyant vehicle operating in a vector field.\nTo prepare the planning problem, the\nuncertainty in the wind field is modeled.\nThen, the problem of reaching a particular goal location is formulated as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP) using a\ndiscretized space approach. Solving the\nMDP provides a policy of what actuation\noption (how much buoyancy change\nand, if applicable, horizontal actuation)\nshould be selected at any given location\nto minimize the expected time-to-goal.\nThe results provide expected time-togoal values from any given location on\nthe globe in addition to the action policy.\nThis stochastic approach can also provide insights not accessible by deterministic methods; for example, one can evaluate variability and risk associated with\n\ndifferent scenarios, rather than only\nviewing the expected outcome.\nThe resulting path-planning tool is a\ngeneral-purpose guidance algorithm\nthat can be applied to exploration balloons on any moon/planet with atmosphere, including Titan, Mars, Venus,\nand gas giants, provided the wind field\nmodels are available. The algorithm is\nparticularly useful for mission planning\nand trade studies because it not only delivers the optimal expected path, but\nalso provides insights into the variability\nand risk associated with different mission scenarios (e.g., under different\nwind variability or vehicle capabilities).\nFinally, these techniques may be useful\nfor other variably buoyant vehicles operating in strong vector fields, such as underwater vehicles in ocean currents,\nwhich may have additional scientific or\nmilitary significance.\nThis work was done by Michael Wolf, James\nC.

It would have to survive insertion\ninto the atmosphere, fly long enough to\nmeet science objectives, and provide a\nstable platform.\nThe feasibility of such a platform was\ntested using the Langley Standard RealTime Simulation in C++. The unique\nfeatures of LaSRS++ are: full, six-degrees-of-freedom flight simulation that\ncan be used to evaluate the performance\nof the aircraft in the Martian environment; capability of flight analysis from\nstart to finish; support of Monte Carlo\nanalysis of aircraft performance; and accepting initial conditions from POST results for the entry and deployment of\nthe entry body.\nStarting with a general aviation model,\nthe design was tweaked to maintain a stable aircraft under expected Martian conditions. Outer mold lines were adjusted\nbased on experience with the Martian atmosphere. Flight control was modified\nfrom a vertical acceleration control law\nto an angle-of-attack control law. Navigation was modified from a vertical acceleration control system to an alpha control\nsystem. In general, a pattern of starting\nwith simple models with well-understood\nbehaviors was selected and modified during testing.\nThis work was done by P. Sean Kenney and\nMark A. Croom of Langley Research Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). LAR-17458\n\nLow-Outgassing Photogrammetry Targets for Use in\nOuter Space\nA short document discusses an investigation of materials for photogrammetry\ntargets for highly sensitive optical scientific instruments to be operated in outer\nspace and in an outer-space-environment-simulating thermal vacuum chamber on Earth. A key consideration in the\nselection of photogrammetry-target materials for vacuum environments is the\nneed to prevent contamination that\ncould degrade the optical responses of\nthe instruments. Therefore, in addition\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2011\n\nto the high levels and uniformity of reflectivity required of photogrammetrytarget materials suitable for use in air,\nthe materials sought must exhibit minimal outgassing.\nCommercially available photogrammetry targets were found to outgas excessively under the thermal and vacuum conditions of interest; this finding\nprompted the investigators to consider\noptically equivalent or superior, loweroutgassing alternative target materials.\nThe document lists several materials\nfound to satisfy the requirements, but\ndoes not state explicitly whether the\nmaterials can be used individually or\nmust be combined in the proper sequence into layered target structures.\nThe materials in question are an aluminized polyimide tape, an acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive, a 500-\xc3\x85-thick\nlayer of vapor-deposited aluminum,\nand spherical barium titanate glass\nbeads having various diameters from 20\nto 63 \xc2\xb5m.\nThis work was done by Jason N. Gross, Henry\nSampler, and Benjamin B. Reed of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1). GSC-15373-1\n\nPlanning the FUSE Mission\nUsing the SOVA Algorithm\nThree documents discuss the Sustainable Objective Valuation and Attainability (SOVA) algorithm and software as\nused to plan tasks (principally, scientific\nobservations and associated maneuvers)\nfor the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite. SOVA is a means\nof managing risk in a complex system,\nbased on a concept of computing the expected return value of a candidate ordered set of tasks as a product of pre-assigned task values and assessments of\nattainability made against qualitatively\ndefined strategic objectives.\nFor the FUSE mission, SOVA autonomously assembles a week-long schedule\nof target observations and associated\nmaneuvers so as to maximize the expected scientific return value while\nkeeping the satellite stable, managing\nthe angular momentum of spacecraft attitude-control reaction wheels, and striving for other strategic objectives. A sixdegree-of-freedom model of the\nspacecraft is used in simulating the tasks,\nand the attainability of a task is calcu-\n\nlated at each step by use of strategic objectives as defined by use of fuzzy inference systems. SOVA utilizes a variant of a\ngraph-search algorithm known as the A*\nsearch algorithm to assemble the tasks\ninto a week-long target schedule, using\nthe expected scientific return value to\nguide the search.\nThis work was done by Jim Lanzi, Scott\nHeatwole, and Philip R. Ward of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center and Thomas Civeit, Humberto Calvani, Jeffrey W. Kruk, and Anatoly\nSuchkov of Johns Hopkins University. Further\ninformation is contained in a TSP (see page\n1). GSC-15436-1\n\nMonitoring Spacecraft\nTelemetry Via Optical\nor RF Link\nA patent disclosure document discusses a photonic method for connecting a spacecraft with a launch vehicle\nupper-stage telemetry system as a means\nfor monitoring a spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s health and\nstatus during and right after separation\nand deployment. This method also provides an efficient opto-coupled capability for prelaunch built-in-test (BIT) on\nthe ground to enable more efficient and\ntimely integration, preflight checkout,\nand a means to obviate any local EMI\n(electromagnetic interference) during\nintegration and test. Additional utility\ncan be envisioned for BIT on other platforms, such as the International Space\nStation (ISS).\nThe photonic telemetry system implements an optical free-space link with a\ndivergent laser transmitter beam\nspoiled over a significant cone angle to\naccommodate changes in spacecraft position without having to angle track it\nduring deployment. Since the spacecraft may lose attitude control and tumble during deployment, the transmitted\nlaser beam interrogates any one of several\nlow-profile meso-scale retro-reflective spatial light modulators (SLMs) deployed\nover the surface of the spacecraft. The return signal beam, modulated by the\nSLMs, contains health, status, and attitude information received back at the\nlaunch vehicle. Very compact low-power\nopto-coupler technology already exists\nfor the received signal (requiring relatively low bandwidths, e.g., \xe2\x89\xa4200 kbps) to\nenable transfer to a forward pass RF relay\nfrom the launch vehicle to TDRSS\n\n33\n\n(Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System) or another recipient. The link\nwould be active during separation and\npost-separation to monitor spacecraft\nhealth, status, attitude, or other data inventories until attitude recovery and\nground control can be re-established. An\noptical link would not interfere with the\nexisting upper stage telemetry and beacon systems, thus meeting launch vehicle\nEMI environmental constraints.\nThis work was done by K.B. Fielhauer and\nB.G. Boone for Goddard Space Flight Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). GSC-14832-1\n\nRobust Thermal Control\nof Propulsion Lines for\nSpace Missions\nA document discusses an approach to\ninsulating propulsion lines for spacecraft. In spacecraft that have propulsion lines that are located externally\n\n34\n\nwith open bus architecture, the lines\nare typically insulated by Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) blankets. MLI on\npropulsion lines tends to have large\nand somewhat random variances in its\nheat loss properties (effective emittance) from one location to the next,\nwhich makes it an un-robust approach\nto control propulsion line temperatures. The approach described here\nconsists of a \xe2\x80\x9cclamshell\xe2\x80\x9d design in\nwhich the inner surface of the shell is\ncoated with low-emissivity aluminized\nKapton tape, and the outer surface is\ncovered with black tape. This clamshell\ncompletely encloses the propulsion\nline. The line itself is covered with its\nheater, which in turn, is covered completely with black tape.\nThis approach would be low in heater\npower needs because even though the\nouter surface of the prop line (and its\nheater) is covered with black tape as well\nas the outer surface of the clamshell, the\n\ninner surface of the clamshell is covered\nwith low-emissivity aluminized Kapton\ntape. Hence, the heat loss from the line\nwill be small and comparable to the MLI\nbased one.\nIn terms of contamination changing\nthe radiative properties of surfaces, since\nthe clamshell\xe2\x80\x99s inner surface is always\nprotected during handling and is only installed after all the work on the prop line\nhas been completed, the controlling surface, which is the clamshell\xe2\x80\x99s inner surface, is always in pristine condition.\nThis proposed design allows for a\nmuch more deterministic and predictable design using a very simple and\nimplementable approach for thermal\ncontrol. It also uses low heater power\nand is robust to handling and contamination during and after implementation.\nThis work was done by Pradeep Bhandari\nof Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
