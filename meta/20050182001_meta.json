Specifically, the company's R&D department wanted to measure the spin rates of experimental golf balls. After the Golf Ball Division requested assistance, researchers and technicians from the NASA Lewis Research Center went to Elyria and conducted several days worth of tests. Ben Hogan is using the test results to improve the spin characteristics of a new ball it plans to introduce to the market.", "title": "NASA Lewis and Ohio Company Hit Hole in One", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T00:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050182001, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050182001, "id": "ac2ec09364384234bf24ed18e6988d62", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 1997", "publicationDate": "1998-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
