Overall heat\nvulnerability was assessed as the census tract level for the city of Richmond,\nVirginia, using the following themes: age, health, minority status and\nsocioeconomic status.\n\nParticipants\n\nAdvisors\n\nDecision Makers\nLand Surface\nTemperature (\xc2\xb0F)\n\nOverall Heat\nVulnerability\n\n75 and under\n75 - 77\n77 \xe2\x80\x93 79\n79 \xe2\x80\x93 81\n81 \xe2\x80\x93 82\n82 \xe2\x80\x93 84\n\n0.6 \xe2\x80\x93 0.7\n0.7 \xe2\x80\x93 0.8\n0.8 \xe2\x80\x93 0.9\n0.9 \xe2\x80\x93 1\n1 \xe2\x80\x93 1.2\n\n84 - 86\n86 \xe2\x80\x93 90\n90 \xe2\x80\x93 97\n97 \xe2\x80\x93 104\n\nDEVELOP Project Characteristics\n\n1.2 \xe2\x80\x93 1.35\n1.35 \xe2\x80\x93 1.5\n1.5 \xe2\x80\x93 1.6\n1.5 \xe2\x80\x93 2\nJames River\n\n55-65 projects are conducted each year \xe2\x80\x93 at their core they share these\ncharacteristics:\n\xef\x80\xb4Highlight the applications and capabilities of NASA Earth observations\n\xef\x80\xb4Address community concerns relating to decision-making for real-world\nenvironmental issues\n\xef\x80\xb4Partner with organizations who can benefit from using NASA Earth\nobservations to enhance decision-making by providing decision support\ntools\n\xef\x80\xb4Align with at least one of the eight NASA Applied Sciences Program\xe2\x80\x99s\nthematic Application Areas\n\xef\x80\xb4Research is conducted by interdisciplinary teams under the scientific\nguidance of DEVELOP Science Advisors and Mentors from NASA and\npartner organizations\n\xef\x80\xb4Create a comprehensive set of deliverables\n\xef\x80\xb4Each individual project is implemented in a 10-week term, with a\nmaximum project length of 3 terms\n\nExample 2:\n\nSouthern Maine Health & Air Quality\nThis project partnered with the Maine Medical Center Research Institute and the\nMaine Vector-borne Disease Working group to evaluate land cover and tick\nhabitat suitability examine tick-borne illness risk in southern Maine.
