The droplets were rapidly quenched against a heavy copper disk rotating at 1725 rpm. The resultant splat cooled flakes were screened. Three flake sizes were finally separated. Flakes of each size were separately processed. The characteristics of the splat cooling process and the properties of the obtained products are discussed. Splat cooling against a metallic substrate permits cooling rates up to about 1,000,000 deg C/sec. Increases in yield strength and tensile strength of 14 to 19% are observed for the splat products. Other improvements are connected with increases in fatigue life and stress rupture performance.", "title": "Structure and properties of a splat cooled 2024 aluminum alloy", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T17:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740053587, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lebo, M."}, "organization": {"name": "Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory", "location": "West Miffin, Pa., United States"}}, "id": "fcabfb00e14b4ac39d24961570b674cf"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19740053587, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grant, N.
