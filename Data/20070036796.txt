b'Source of Acquisition\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n\nDan Smith\nInterview Questions\nMay 24,2007\nFINAL DRAFT\n\n1. Please describe GMSEC. What are its most important aspects?\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA is responsible for most of\nEO) scientific satellites. GSFC also manages\nNASA\'s sub-orbital and l o\ne orbits. Each satellite mission team has\nseveral missions in higher\ntraditionally developed its ow\n01 center, sometimes basing their approach on that of\nan earlier mission. NASA engineers have built great new software applications, but the use was\nlimited to single missions due to integration difficulties caused by unique mission system designs.\nBy 2000 it was becoming clear that budget restrictions at NASA could not support the old\napproach. In addition, commercial products were becoming more mature, satellite fleets were\nbeing considered, missions were talking about new operational concepts, and new development\napproaches were becoming common outside of the space industry.\nThe Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center, or GMSEC, was started in 2001 to create a new\nstandard approach for managing GSFC missions. Standardized approaches in the past involved\nselecting and then integrating the most appropriate set of functional tools. Assumptions were\nmade that "one size fits all" and that tool changes would not be necessary for many years.\nGMSEC took a very different approach and has proven to be very successful.\nThe core of the GMSEC architecture consists of a publish/subscribe message bus, standardized\nmessage formats, and an Applications Programming Interface (API). The API supports multiple\noperating systems, programming languages and messaging middleware products. We use a\nGMSEC-developed free middleware for low-cost development. A high capacity, robust\nmiddleware is used for operations and a messaging system with a very small memory footprint is\nused for on-board flight software. Software components can use the standard message formats\nor develop adapters to convert from their native formats to the GMSEC formats. We do not want\nvendors to modify their core products. Over 50 software components are now available for use\nwith the GMSEC architecture. Most available commercial telemetry and command systems,\nincluding the GMV hifly@ Satellite Control System, have been adapted to run in the GMSEC labs.\nA new level of situational awareness is realized by having all components publish keep-alive and\nstatus messages which are merged for display and analysis. New display tools show messages\nfrom across the functional areas of a control center. By requiring components to accept control\ndirectives over the bus, automation tools can be developed which analyze status messages and\ntake appropriate actions when conditions are recognized. The GMSEC automation tools allow for\ncombinations of status messages and temporal conditions to trigger multi-step actions.\nGMSEC systems have been in operations since 2005. The first three missions to use GMSEC\neach selected a different telemetry and command system and yet they selected the same\n\'\nautomation and paging systems. Two selected the same trending systems. The GMSEC\nautomation tools have allowed the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) to reduce the\nnumber of operational shifts per day. Other missions using GMSEC have operated totally "lights\nout" for periods of up to several weeks.\n\nThe number of components compatible with GMSEC continues to grow. The GMSEC\narchitecture is planned for use on most of GSFC\'s missions now under development, is\noperational or under evaluation at other NASA Centers and is being used to re-engineer older\nmission control centers and the GSFC flight dynamics system. GMSEC has allowed commercial\nproducts to be easily integrated with other NASA tools, has allowed in-house tools to be applied\nto many different missions, has allowed for the exchanging of software components with NASA\nand with outside organizations and has significantly reduced system integration time.\n\n2. Please describe some of the work of the CCSDS which you have been\ninvolved with. What role will standards and interoperability play in the\nfuture of space systems?\nCCSDS continues to be the primary source for space-ground communications standards for\nNASA missions. Most recently, I have been involved with XTCE, SLE and SM&C definition or\nplanning.\nThe XML Telemetry and Command Exchange (XTCE) standard is becoming the first joint\nstandard between CCSDS and the Object Management Group (OMG) organizations. XTCE\nprovides a standard data exchange format for master telemetry and command list information. I\nexpect it to be widely accepted across commercial products. Control centers which today have a\nmix of in-house software and vendor products often need telemetry or command lists defined in\nmultiple custom formats. We are moving towards XTCE as the common format for inputting the\ndata into all of our tools. In addition, NASA has begun specifying its use in new proposal\nrequests.\nCCSDS Space Link Extensions (SLE) will simplify the routing and distribution of science and\nengineering data directly from the remote ground stations. Multiple end-users can effectively\nsubscribe to data streams of interest. Eventually, the SLE standards are to be extended to allow\na common approach for ground terminal scheduling and configuration across NASA and nonNASA assets - greatly reducing the amount of custom interface software now needed for\ndifferent NASA systems and commercial. Should Internet Protocols become widely used for\nspace-ground communications, it may be possible to have the SLE routing capabilities handled\ndirectly by the IP communications protocol.\nThe Spacecraft Monitor & Control (SM&C) effort involves defining a standard Service Oriented\nArchitecture to allow space Agencies, including NASA and ESA, to have common applications\nsoftware components and standard interfaces. NASA is increasing its effort in this area with an\ninitial emphasis on the interoperability benefits it could bring.\nOverall, I feel that standards in the areas of space-ground communications and interoperability\nwill continue to be critical. As more ambitious missions are deployed and international\npartnerships become the norm, the need for clear interoperability standards increases. Across\nthe industry right now, however, is also a major debate about whether ground systems\nthemselves should be the topic of standards. Several groups are now developing Service\nOriented Architectures with the belief that many integration and reuse issues will be solved if\nindustry matches to their approach. I don\'t think we are to that point yet, and would like to see\nindustry continue to advance their systems per their own business models for their own\ncompetitive advantages while maintaining compliance with emerging space industry\ncommunications and interoperability standards.\n\n3. What role do GMSEC and standards play in NASA\'s Exploration\nInitiative?\nNASA\'s Exploration Initiative will require a wide range of space and ground assets to be deployed\nover the next twenty or more years. Many of the GMSEC concepts and lessons learned are\nbeing planned into the Exploration Systems, although the extent to which GMSEC will be used\ndirectly is not yet clear. Our Exploration teams are working on publish/subscribe concepts\nbetween space and ground assets and ways to increase commonality across data systems while\navoiding vendor or product lock-in and allowing for technology advancement over many years.\nThese are all areas where the GMSEC efforts are of particular value.\nAlready, we have GMSEC labs established in many NASA Centers and connected over NASA\nnetworks to support Exploration integration testing and the evaluation of proposed standards and\nnew conceptual ideas.\nMany of the CCSDS standards are being specified for Exploration, including the recent XTCE\nstandard for telemetry and command lists and CFDP for file transfers. Exploration requirements\nand the use of IP will require the creation of new standards to better specify routing, delay\ntolerance, quality of service, publish/subscribe subject naming and other communications\nmanagement attributes. With Exploration representing such a large portion of the overall NASA\neffort, I expect that approaches adopted by Exploration will spread to other NASA missions and\nthen to non-NASA and non-U.S. missions and then into commercial products.\n\n4. What are the biggest challenges facing satellite ground systems today?\nWhat are the possible ways of addressing these challenges?\n& h the challenge of the past decade was to architect ground systems to simplify integration by\ncreating clean external interfaces and efficient ways to meet mission-specific needs. I believe the\nindustry has done a good job in this area.\n\n0\n\nI hink the next challenge is to adapt to the needs for much more efficient operations. Can the\ngr nd system handle everything itself and just notify us if there is a problem? Can fleet\noperations of dissimilar satellites become the norm? Can the operators configure their systems\nand add automation rules themselves? Can I split operations between the satellite experts and\nstudents at a local university? Can I easily transition my system from the integration-and-test\nphase into operations? Can my system interact with someone else\'s system to coordinate\nactivities? Can event or alarm messages include body text or attachments like e-mail does to\nkeep me better informed?\n\n"\\r\ntw\n\nI\nindustry needs to be proactive in developing solutions to these issues. Today\'s systems\nhave nicer displays and more modern underlying software languages, but much of the basic\nfunctionality is as it was many years ago. I believe the current architectures are ready to support\nnew capabilities and the user community is ready to confidently take advantage of the new\napproaches waiting to be developed.\n\n5. There has been a fair amount of discussion regarding the future of\nspace systems and how a satellite will simply become a TCPIIP router in\nthe sky. What do you think the impact of this would be on satellite ground\nsystems?\n\nFirst, using IP and space routing is not simple. There are many technical issues with time delays,\nerror rates, disruptions and long-duration outages, limited bandwidth, dynamic routing based on\nrelative orbital positions and the need for one-way links. All of these issues are being worked on\nand prototyped at NASA labs. Despite the challenges, IP still looks very promising.\nWith an on-board network, commands could be directly routed to devices. Science and\nengineering telemetry data could be routed through the ground station to different users.\nEventually, satellites or even a moon base could route data to other nearby or visible nodes.\nThe initial impact to the ground systems may be very low. If IP is considered the packet transport\nmechanism and protocol, then a well-layered ground system architecture should have isolated\nthe impacts. The contents of many of the telemetry or command packets may stay relatively\nunchanged and the processing could be the same as with today\'s packetized processing.\n\n6. What is the role of industry in the evolution of satellite ground systems,\nin your opinion?\nStandards, users\' long-term visions and commercial product vendor innovations all work together\nto advance the state of our industry. Commercial product vendors are in the best position to\nunderstand the trends taking place across the wide variety of satellite operators. The vendors are\nalso in position to leverage ideas from one user for the benefit of another.\nI would like to see more interaction between all user and vendor communities to openly discuss\nfuture directions. All groups have a vested interest in the future directions and there are many\nsharp people able to help set new directions. Actual product implementation decisions still need\nto be based on contract requirements or sound business model decisions.\n\nIt also seems that telemetry and command systems are becoming commodities, where any of\nseveral vendors\' products can perform reliably. I would like to see more diversification between\nthe commercial vendors. For this to happen, a company really needs to push into new areas\nsuch as model-based operations, automation, dynamic discovery or extensive fleet operations.\n\nDan Smith\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)\nInformation Systems Division\nSenior Engineer, Satellite Ground Systems\n\nDan Smith has nearly 30 years of experience developing satellite ground systems for\nmissions as diverse as Hubble Space Telescope, NOAA\'s 5-satellite GOES weather\nsatellite system, and Globalstar\'s constellation of commercial communications satellites.\nHe joined NASA in 2001 as the project manager for the Goddard Mission Services\nEvolution Center developing a standards- and message-based ground systems\narchitecture now operational on multiple GSFC missions.
