b'w\n\nTransportation\n\nAviation Design Software\n\nT\n\nhere is an urgent need to help revive an ailing\ndomestic general aviation industry in the United\nStates. That imperative is receiving increased\nattention by NASA.\nTo this end, by way of a Langley Research Center\nPhase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\ncontract, DARcorporation of Lawrence, Kansas has\nmade the art of designing a general aviation aircraft far\neasier and less expensive.\nToday\'s elite corps of aircraft manufacturers utilize\npowerful computers capable of running expensive\nComputer Aided Design (CAD) software. But the\nmajority of small General Aviation manufacturers\ncannot afford these investments. Rather, small firms\ndesign on paper or with computers utilizing selfgenerated programs on spreadsheets.\nDARcorporation has developed a General Aviation\nCAD package. This affordable, user-friendly preliminary\ndesign system for General Aviation aircraft runs on the\npopular 486 IBM-compatible personal computers. The\nsystem gives the design engineer the tools to briskly\nevolve an aircraft configuration from weight sizing and\nwing loading to stability and control surface requirements, among a host of parameters.\nA Phase I1 SBIR\ncontract was awarded\nby NASA to the\ncompany, resulting in a\ncommercial product\nthat the firm is now\nmarketing. Individuals\nwho are taking the\nhome-built approach,\nsmall manufacturers of\nGeneral Aviation\nairplanes, as well as\nstudents and others\ninterested in the design\nand analysis of aircraft\nare possible users of the\npackage.\nDARcorporation\'s\nGeneral Aviation\nComputer Aided\nDesign (G.A.-CAD)\n\nDARcotporationS GeneraCAuiation Computer\nAided Design ( G A - C p a c R a g e can cut in\nhalfthe design and development time of a\ngeneral aviation aircraj?. MSA SBZRfinding\nbebed bring the sofhuare to the computer screen.\n\n1\n\nCommercial Benefits-Spinoffs\n\n-\n\n--\n\npackage can reduce design and development time by\n50 percent, replacing tedious hand calculations. Typically, design cycle times of two to four years are required\nto l l l y conceive a General Aviation aircraft. G.A.-CAD\ncan reduce this time period by half, notes William\nAnemaat, Vice President of DARcorporation.\nThe G.A.-CAD enables a user to analyze an existing\ndesign, make small changes to one part of the aircraft,\nand then rapidly determine the effect of the modification to all other aspects of the plane design. All applicable performance and flying quality regulations are\nembedded in the program. This gives the designer an\nimmediate judgment as to whether or not the design\nmeets air worthiness regulations. Such a feature,\ntherefore, benefits those manufacturers with little\nexperience in obtaining General Aviation aircraft\ncertification.\nEngineering Systems, Inc. (ESI) of Colorado\nSprings, Colorado, is using the DARcorporation\'s\nsoftware for aircraft analysis. A small consulting firm in\nsimulator development and a broad spectrum of other\nengineering disciplines, ESI used the software in the\ndevelopment of an aerodynamic model of the Airbus\nA320 jet transport for a training device. "We are pleased\nwith the program and have found that the initialcost\nwas quickly repaid in reduced labor costs," said ESI\'s\nDirector of Aeronautical Engineering, Dr. David L.\nKohlman.\nModeled after DARcorporation\'s work on Advanced\nAircraft Analysis (AAA) software, the G.A.-CAD\npackage features ten discrete modules: weight, performance, geometry, aerodynamics, thrustlpower, stability\nand control, dynamics, loads, structures, and cost. These\nfeatures improve product design. More alternative\ndesigns can be evaluated in the same time span, which\ncan lead to improved quality.\nBy using the cost module, various expenses in\nairplane design programs can be computed. Research\nand development, manufacturing, prototype, and direct\nand indirect operating costs can be estimated using this\nmodule.\nG.A.-CAD incorporates a user-interface based on\nthe Microsoft Windowsmoperating system, making the\nsoftware package highly user-friendly,\nHaving the software package at various General\nAviation manufacturing sites, DARcorporation expects\nto see significant improvement of competitiveness, and\nshould bolster the chances of success for newly established companies.\n@\n\nWindows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Inc.\n\n'
