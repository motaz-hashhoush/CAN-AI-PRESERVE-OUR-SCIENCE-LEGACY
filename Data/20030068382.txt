Such technology would be applicable to long-range aircraft\nusing medium to high by-pass ratio engines. With support from the Advanced Subsonic Technology Noise\nReduction program, these efforts resulted in the formulation of an experimental study, the Separate Flow\nNozzle Test (SFNT). SFNT\xe2\x80\x99s objectives were to develop a data base on various by-pass ratio nozzles,\nscreen quietest configurations and acquire pertinent data for predicting the plume behavior and ultimately\nits corresponding jet noise. The SFNT was a team effort between NASA GRC\xe2\x80\x99s various divisions, NASA\nLangley, General Electric, Pratt&Whitney, United Technologies Research Corporation, Allison Engine\nCompany, Boeing, ASE FluiDyne, MicroCraft, Eagle Aeronautics and Combustion Research and Flow\nTechnology Incorporated.\nSFNT found several exhaust systems providing over 2.5 EPNdB reduction at take-off with less than 0.5%\nthrust loss at cruise with simulated flight speed of 0.8 Mach. Please see the following SFNT related\nreports: Saiyed, et al. (NASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942000-209948), Saiyed, et al. (NASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942000-210524),\nLow, et al.

(NASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942001-210611.).\nI wish to thank the entire SFNT team of nearly 50 scientists, engineers, technicians and programmers\ninvolved in this project. SFNT would have fallen well short of its goals without their untiring support,\ndedication to developing the jet noise technology.\nNaseem Saiyed\nSFNT Research Engineer\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\niii\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nv\n\nLIST OF SYMBOLS AND NOMENCLATURE FOR NAMING TEST NOZZLE\nCONFIGURATIONS\n\nvii\n\nLIST OF TABLES\n\nix\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\n\nx\n\n1.0\n\nSUMMARY\n\n1\n\n2.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\n3.0\n3.1\n\nTEST OBJECTIVES\nSEPARATE-FLOW BASELINE NOZZLE SOURCE LEVELS PREDICTION\n\n7\n8\n\n4.0\nNOZZLE MODELS DESCRIPTION, TEST FACILITY, TEST METHODS, DATA ACQUISITION\nAND REDUCTION PROCEDURES\n4.1\nNOZZLE MODELS DESCRIPTIONS\n4.1.1\nSEPARATE-FLOW NOZZLES (SFN) BASELINE MODELS\n4.1.2\nMIXING ENHANCER DEVICES/CONCEPTS\n4.1.3\nCFD ANAYSES FOR SELECTED NOZZLE DESIGNS\n4.2\nTEST FACILITY AND TEST METHODS\n4.2.1\nNozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR)\n4.2.2\nAnechoic Test Area\n4.2.3\nFacility Instrumentation\n4.2.4\nAcoustic Test Matrix and Test Variables\n4.2.5\nTest Methods\n4.3\nDATA ACQUISITION AND REDUCTION METHODS\n4.3.1\nAcoustic Data Acquisition and Reduction Method\n4.3.2\nPhased-Array Microphone Jet Noise Source Location Data Reduction Method\n4.3.3\nNozzle Exit Plume Survey Data Reduction Method\n\n11\n11\n11\n13\n16\n20\n20\n20\n21\n21\n21\n25\n25\n26\n26\n\n5.0\nDISCUSSIONS OF TEST RESULTS\n27\n5.1\nEPNL SUMMARY FOR All SFN TEST CONFIGURATIONS\n27\n5.1.1\nResults for Model 3 Baseline Nozzle\n27\n5.2\nRESULTS FOR SELECTED MODEL 3 MIXER DEVICES\n28\n5.2.1\nEPNL versus Mixed Jet Mach Number Correlations\n28\n5.2.2\nEPNL Reductions/Suppressions Achieved by Model 3 Mixer Devices\n28\n5.2.3\nEffect of Freejet Mach Number on Model 3 Mixer Devices EPNL Reductions/Suppressions\n28\n5.2.4\nEffect of Freejet Mach Number on Mixer Devices\xe2\x80\x99 PNL Directivities\n29\n5.2.5\nSPL Spectral Characteristics of Selected Mixer Devices (P&W\xe2\x80\x99s 48-Flipper Tabbed Primary and Fan\nNozzles)\n29\n5.2.6\nComparisons of SPL Spectral Characteristics of Other Mixer Devices\n31\n5.3\nSELECTED MICROPHONE PHASED-ARRAY TESTING RESULTS\n31\n5.3.1\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A\n32\n5.3.2\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array B\n32\n5.3.3\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A Point 23\n33\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\nv\n\n5.3.4\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A Mach 0.0\n5.3.5\nModel 3IC Viewed with Array A\n5.3.6\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array D\n5.3.7\nSelected integrated SPL Spectra\n5.4\nSELECTED PLUME SURVEY PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE PROFILES\n5.5\nASSESSMENT OF EPNL BENEFITS OF APPLYING SELECTED \xe2\x80\x9cBEST\xe2\x80\x9d MIXER DEVICES TO\nP&W's ENGINE PRODUCTS.\n\n33\n33\n34\n34\n35\n36\n\n6.0\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n37\n\n7.0\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY\n\n38\n\n8.0\n\nREFERENCES\n\n39\n\n9.0\nAPPENDIXES\n9.1 A.

GEAE provided six (6) baseline axisymmetric\nseparate-flow nozzle models with bypass ratios (BPR) of 5, and 8, with internal and external\nplugs and eleven (11) different jet noise suppression configurations consisting of various\nchevrons, vortex generator doublets and a \xe2\x80\x9ctongue\xe2\x80\x9d mixer (designed by AEC). P&W\nsupplied nine (9) jet noise suppression configurations representing four (4) jet noise\nsuppression concepts (i.e. offset centerline fan nozzle, flipper-tabbed fan and core nozzles,\nscarfed fan nozzle, core half and full mixers with 10- and 20-mini-lobes, respectively). All\nnine of P&W\xe2\x80\x99s suppressor configurations were for the baseline external plug, BPR 5 (model\n3) nozzle only. The majority of the suppression devices provided by GEAE and P&W were\nalso for the model 3, external plug, BPR=5 nozzle. GEAE and P&W\xe2\x80\x99s nozzles were designed\nand fabricated by the same model hardware company, Aero Systems Engineering (ASE). The\nmodel nozzles were interchangeable on the primary and on the fan streams. P&W\xe2\x80\x99s primary\nnozzles could be tested with GEAE\xe2\x80\x99s fan nozzles, and vice versa.\nThe participants of the SFNT program adopted a common nomenclature for describing the\ntest nozzle configurations. The nozzle configuration is to be identified by a three \xe2\x80\x9cdigit\xe2\x80\x9d\nalphanumeric code (i.e. # X Y where # is the nozzle model number, X is the designation\nfor the core nozzle, and Y is the designation for the fan nozzle). A listing of the various\nnozzle configurations and the corresponding alphanumeric codes is given below.\nFor Example : Nozzle Configuration\nModel ( # )\n1 = Coplanar (BPR=5)\n4 = Internal Plug (BPR=8)\n\n#\n\nX\n\nY\n\n2 = Internal Plug (BPR=5)\n5 = External Plug (BPR=8)\n\n3 = External Plug (BPR=5)\n6 = Modified Plug (BPR=5)\n\n(X) - Core Nozzle Designation\n\n(Y) - Fan Nozzle Designation\n\nB= Baseline Axisymmetric Nozzle (GE)\nC12= 12 Chevrons (GE)\nC8= 8 Chevrons (GE)\nI= 12 Inward Facing Chevrons (GE)\nA= 12 Alternating Facing Chevrons (GE)\nDi= 64 Internal VG Doublets (GE)\nDx= 20 External VG Doublets (GE)\nT24= 24 Flipper Tabs (P&W)\n\nB= Baseline Axisymmetric Nozzle (GE)\nC= 24 Chevrons (GE)\nDi= 96 Internal VG Doublets (GE)\nT24= 24 Flipper Tabs (P&W)\nT48= 48 Flipper Tabs (P&W)\nOmax= Maximum Offset Centerline\nNozzle (P&W)\nS= Scarfed Nozzle (P&W)\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\nvii\n\nT48= 48 Flipper Tabs (P&W)\nHm= 10-minilobe Half Mixer (P&W)\nTm= Tongue Mixer (AEC)\nFm= 20-minilobe Full Mixer (P&W)\n\nCt= 24 Chevrons with O-ring\nboundary trip (GE)\nCv= 24 Chevrons with external VG(GE)\n\nAs stated earlier, the majority of the jet noise suppression devices tested were for model 3\n(BPR=5, external plug). Combinations of different primary and fan nozzles were tested. For\nexample, a 24-tabbed primary nozzle was tested in conjunction with a baseline fan nozzle\nand the resulting test configuration is identified as 3T24B, where \xe2\x80\x9c3\xe2\x80\x9d is the model number,\n\xe2\x80\x9cT24\xe2\x80\x9d is the 24-flipper tabs primary nozzle and \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d is the baseline fan nozzle. Other\ncombinations of primary and fan jet noise suppression nozzles that were tested are identified\nby the same basic notations described in this nomenclature.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\nviii\n\nLIST OF TABLES\nTable\n\nPage\n\n1.\n\nPower Settings Test Matrix for Separate-Flow Nozzle Noise Test\n\n40\n\n2.\n\nPhased Array Test

There had been little research effort at reducing\njet noise from the high bypass ratio (HBPR), non-mixed, separate-flow, short duct exhaust\nsystems that are typical of today\xe2\x80\x99s large turbofan engines that power such aircraft as the Boeing\n747, 757, 767 and 777. Part of the reason for this lack of research effort on these separate-flow\nsystems is that jet noise has not typically been the dominant noise source in these HBPR engines.\nHowever, the requirement to provide ever higher thrusts to power new and growth versions (i.e.\nhigher takeoff gross weight) of the aircraft, means that today\xe2\x80\x99s HBPR engines have to operate at\neven higher jet temperatures and pressure ratios and to generate higher jet velocities and thus\nhigher jet noise levels. In 1995, upon recommendations from industry\xe2\x80\x99s and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s AST\nSteering Committee and Technical Working Group, the NASA Separate-Flow Nozzle Jet Noise\n(SFN) Reduction Test Program was conceived and launched. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Lewis Research Center\nrecognized that for engine thrust growth to continue without an increase in aircraft noise levels\nor a major costly engine/nacelle redesign, jet noise reduction through the use of jet noise external\nsuppression devices for these separate-flow jet exhaust systems needed to be developed. These\njet noise suppression devices have to be lightweight, have low thrust loss and be easy to\nincorporate into existing separate-flow nozzle exhaust systems. The goal of this effort was to\ndemonstrate a Three (3) decibel reduction in jet noise (relative to the 1992 technology) for\nnonmixed separate-flow nozzle exhaust systems.\nNASA awarded Pratt & Whitney (P&W) contract NAS3-27727, (AST Task Order 14.2) to\ndesign, build and test separate-flow exhaust nozzle scale models in the bypass ratio range of 5 to\n8, employing a range of potential jet noise external suppression devices. The Boeing Commercial\nAirplane Company was subcontracted by P&W to help specify possible test configurations with\nnoise reduction potential and to supply phased microphone array measurements to demonstrate\nthat phased array techniques could be used for (1) jet noise source location visualization without\nintrusion into the jet plume, and (2) explanation of how the different suppression devices affect\nthe jet noise sources. The United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) was also subcontracted\nto analyze, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses, the flow fields of the some of\nthe nozzle concepts selected and designed by P&W. P&W provided nine (9) jet noise\nsuppression devices consisting of: a 24-flipper tabbed primary nozzle, a 48-flipper tabbed\nprimary nozzle, a 24-flipper tabbed fan nozzle, a 48-flipper tabbed fan nozzle, a scarfed fan\nnozzle, and two offset- centerline fan nozzles with different amounts of offset, a 10-mini-lobed\nprimary half mixer and a 20-mini-lobed primary full mixer.\nThese scaled model suppression devices, together with other model nozzle devices from the\nGeneral Electric Aircraft Engine Company (GEAE), provided under a separate NASA/GEAE\ncontract, were tested in the NASA Lewis Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) under static and\nsimulated flight conditions. Far-field acoustic data were taken and the noise results analyzed.\nThe noise results indicated that inward-facing chevrons on primary nozzles and flipper-tabs on\nprimary nozzles achieved Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) suppressions close to the\nSFN program goal of 3 EPNdB (at mixed jet velocity condition of 1200 ft/sec). Adding fan\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n1\n\nnozzle chevrons to the above primary nozzle devices provided only small additional EPNL\nbenefits. The results also indicated that primary nozzle devices effected the low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency components of the baseline nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s far-field Sound Pressure Noise (SPL)\nspectra. The fan nozzle devices effected the high-frequency component of the baseline nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s\nSPL spectra and in almost all cases, the fan devices actually increased the levels of these highfrequency noise. Other test nozzle devices, i.e. vortex generator doublets (GEAE), scarfed fan\nnozzle, offset-centerline fan nozzle, min-lobed mixers, tongue mixer (Allison), neutral chevrons\n(GEAE), and combination nozzles consisting of two of these concepts did not achieve the\ndesired 3 EPNdB goal.\nThe Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s phased-array results showed that phased-array technology could be used\nsuccessfully to provide qualitative images of the jet noise sources of the separate-flow nozzle\nwithout intrusion into the jet exhaust plume. The phased-array tests showed that at low to mid\nfrequencies, there were two distinct jet noise sources. The first source is located near the nozzle\nexit and the second source is downstream at several nozzle diameters. The tests also showed that\nthe primary and fan mixer nozzle devices generally increased the upstream and decreased the\ndownstream jet source region\xe2\x80\x99s sound intensities. The best noise suppression devices are the\nprimary inward-facing chevrons and flipper-tabbed primary nozzles, which tended to decrease\nthe downstream source region with only minimum increase in the upstream source region.\nNASA Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 plume survey data showed the primary tabbed nozzles produced pressure and\ntemperature profiles that were similar to those produced by high-penetration lobed mixers. The\nprofile is a 6-lobe pattern for the 24-flipper tabbed and a 12-lobe pattern for the 48-flipper tabbed\nprimary nozzle. In P&W\xe2\x80\x99s tab design, which incorporated a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d tab separating each \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d\nand \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d tab, the neutral tab increased the effective lobe penetration and did not add to the\neffective \xe2\x80\x9clobe\xe2\x80\x9d count of the device. In the 24-tab case, the effective lobe count of the plume\nprofile is controlled by the six \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d and six \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d tabs. In Gee\xe2\x80\x99s inward-facing chevron design,\nthe effective lobe count of the plume profile is the same as the total number of chevrons.\nIn summary, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s model-scale nozzle noise tests show that it is possible to achieve a 3\nEPNdB jet noise reduction with inward-facing chevrons and flipper-tabs installed on the primary\nnozzle and fan nozzle chevrons. These chevrons and tabs are simple devices and are easy to be\nincorporated into existing short duct separate-flow non-mixed nozzle exhaust systems. However,\nthese devices are expected to cause some small amount of thrust loss relative to the axisymmetric\nbaseline nozzle system. Thus, it is important to have these devices further tested in a calibrated\nnozzle performance test facility to quantify the thrust performances of these devices. The choice\nof chevrons or tabs for jet noise suppression would most likely be based on the results of thrust\nloss performance tests to be conducted by Aero System Engineering (ASE) Inc.\nIt is anticipated that the most promising concepts identified from this program will be validated\nin full scale engine tests at both Pratt & Whitney and Allied-Signal, under funding from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nEngine Validation of Noise Reduction Concepts (EVNRC) programs. This will bring the\ntechnology readiness level to the point where the jet noise suppression concepts could be\nincorporated with high confidence into either new or existing turbofan engines having short-duct,\nseparate-flow nacelles.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n2\n\n2.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe modern high bypass ratio (HBPR) turbofan engines powering current aircraft such as the\n747, 757, 767 and 777 still continue to generate significant levels of jet noise. The\nrequirement to provide even higher thrusts to power new and growth versions of these\naircraft requires these HBPR engines to operate at still higher fan pressure ratios and generate\nyet higher jet velocities and thus higher jet noise. Most previous jet noise suppression\nresearch had been targeted at reducing jet noise from either the subsonic mixed-flow nozzle\nsystems or the supersonic low-bypass turbojet nozzle systems. Upon recommendations from\nthe aerospace industry, the NASA LeRC Separate-Flow Nozzle (SFN) jet noise reduction test\nprogram was conceived and launched in 1995. The NASA Lewis Research Center\nrecognized that to allow aircraft takeoff weight/engine thrust growth to continue without an\nincrease in current aircraft noise levels or a major costly engine/nacelle redesign, jet noise\nreduction through the use of jet noise external suppression devices needed to be developed.\nIn addition, these jet noise suppression devices should be lightweight, have low thrust losses\nand be easy to incorporate into existing short duct separate-flow nozzle exhaust systems.\nForeign engine manufacturers, such as Rolls Royce, often have used long fan duct mixed\nflow nacelles with internal mixers to reduce the levels of jet noise. These exhaust systems\nprovide noise reduction but at the expense of increased weight and cost. To replace existing\nseparate flow nacelles with this type of suppression would require a major effort. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nand industry\xe2\x80\x99s goal for the current program was to develop new jet noise suppressor\ntechnology for separate flow nacelles that would provide a 3 decibel reduction in jet noise\nrelative to the 1992 technology.\nNASA awarded Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE)\ncontracts (NAS3-27727, Task Order 14.2 and NAS3-27720, AoI 14.3 respectively) to design,\nbuild and test separate-flow exhaust nozzle scale models in the bypass ratio range of 5 to 8,\nemploying a range of potential jet noise external suppression devices. These scaled model\nsuppression devices were to be tested in the NASA Lewis Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR)\nunder static and simulated flight takeoff conditions. Far-field acoustic data would be taken.\nThe Boeing Commercial Airplane Company was subcontracted by P&W to help define\npossible test configurations with noise reduction potential and to supply phased microphone\narray measurements to demonstrate that phased array technique could be used for (1) jet\nnoise source location visualization without intrusion into the jet plume, and (2) explanation\nof how the different suppression devices affect the jet noise sources. After the completion of\nthe noise tests and noise suppression data analysis, NASA and industry would select a few of\nthe best noise suppressor nozzles for the further testing in another test facility (Aero Systems\nEngineering) to measure their thrust loss (performance) characteristics. This performance\ntesting was to be conducted under a separate NASA contract.\nThe acoustic scale model nozzle test program involved cooperative efforts from NASA\nLeRC, P&W, United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), Boeing Commercial Aircraft\nCompany (subcontractors to P&W), GEAE and Allison Engine Company (AEC)\n(subcontractor to GEAE). GEAE provided five (5) baseline axisymmetric separate flow\nnozzle models with internal and external plugs with BPR\xe2\x80\x99s of 5 and 8. The flow lines of these\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n3\n\nfive baseline nozzles were scaled up (1.0224 factor) from the baseline nozzles used by\nNASA LaRC in their AST Separate Flow Data Base and Suppression Study. The scale factor\nof 1.0224 was chosen so that the model nozzles could fit into the NATR test rig. GEAE also\nprovided eleven (11) different jet noise suppression devices consisting of various chevrons,\nvortex generator (VG) doublets and a tongue mixer designed by the Allison Engine\nCompany. The tongue mixer had a significantly larger effective throat area when tested with\nmodel 2 baseline fan nozzle, resulting in a BPR smaller than the desired BPR of 5. To get the\ncorrect BPR, AEC had to modify baseline model 2 core nozzle area by building a new longer\ninternal plug that extended further out into the core nozzle throat, thus reducing the core\nnozzle area and flow rate. This model designated as model #6 does not have the same core\nnozzle area and flow rates as model 2. AEC\xe2\x80\x99s tongue mixer was the only core nozzle\nconfigured and tested as model 6. P&W provided nine (9) jet noise suppression devices\nrepresenting four (4) different jet noise reduction concepts (i.e. offset centerline fan nozzle,\nscarfed fan nozzle, flipper-tabbed core and fan nozzles (with unique tab sequencing\narrangements), and a 10-mini-lobed core half mixer and a 20-mini-lobed full mixer). All nine\nP&W\xe2\x80\x99s configurations were for the model 3, external plug (and BPR of 5) test nozzle.\nAero Systems Engineering (ASE) won competitive bids from both P&W and GEAE to\nfabricate the test model nozzle hardware. Because of this, ASE was able to coordinate the\ndelivery of the test hardware to fit the test schedule and eliminate necessary hardware\nreworking since all nozzle parts can be fitted in ASE prior to their delivery to the NASA test\nfacility.\nThe noise portion of the SFNT program was conducted in the NASA Lewis Research Center\nNozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) facility from the 20th of March to the 18th of June, 1997.\nFar-field noise data were acquired and NASA Lewis was responsible for the acquisition and\nreduction of the these data. The processed data were then provided to P&W, GEAE and\nAllison in a prior agreed upon electronic database format. The processed data were scaled by\na model-to-engine scale factor of 8 and projected to a level 1500-ft altitude flyover flight\npath to obtain flight noise levels for a typically sized engine. In addition, NASA Lewis\nrequested P&W and GEAE to make separate noise predictions for the most promising jet\nnoise suppression devices, applied specifically to each company\xe2\x80\x99s jet engine products which\nhave nozzle scale factors different than 8.\nNASA selected ASE (through competitive bidding) to conduct performance (thrust loss)\nmeasurements for the baseline nozzle and a few selected devices that demonstrated\nsignificant jet noise suppression. These performance measurements are required for\nevaluating the nozzle performance vs noise suppression characteristics, since any device that\nwould be considered for today\xe2\x80\x99s turbofan engines must have significant noise suppression\nand low thrust losses. ASE is scheduled to complete the performance testing and report the\nresults by end of the first quarter of 1998.\nThe SFNT program required a high degree of cooperation and coordination between P&W\nand GEAE. A single test plan was prepared by GEAE (with inputs from P&W) and was\napproved by NASA. This test plan provided detailed design information on the different jet\nnoise external suppression concepts, and specified the type of tests (i.e. acoustics, phased\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n4\n\nmicrophone arrays, jet plume surveys, laser and Schlieren), data acquisition and data\nreduction requirements. This information is given in Reference 1. For the final test reporting,\nit was decided that P&W and GEAE would each prepare separate reports covering the\nanalyses that each company was contractually obligated to perform. Thus, there will be two\ntest reports for the SFNT program. P&W\xe2\x80\x99s test report is provided here and documents the\nindependent analyses conducted by P&W of the noise data for Model 3, external plug with\nBPR 5 nozzle jet noise for the baseline and suppression devices. GEAE\xe2\x80\x99s and Allison\xe2\x80\x99s joint\ntest report would document GEAE\xe2\x80\x99s and Allison\xe2\x80\x99s analyses for the same Model 3 nozzles\nplus the other additional nozzle models (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6). P&W\xe2\x80\x99s and GEAE\xe2\x80\x99s test reports\ntaken together should cover the entire scope of the SFNT program.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n5\n\n3.0\n\nTEST OBJECTIVES\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s overall test objectives for the SFNT program were five-fold. The first objective was\nto create a jet noise acoustic database for the separate-flow nozzle baseline exhaust system\nfor bypass-ratios of 5 and 8. The second objective was to evaluate the noise reduction\ncharacteristics of the different noise suppression devices designed and built by P&W and\nGEAE for the separate-flow nozzle exhaust systems, and to demonstrate that a 3 decibel jet\nnoise reduction would be possible with these new external suppression devices. The third\nobjective was to conduct limited near-field acoustic measurements using a Boeing Company\nprovided phased-array microphone system to locate the major sources of jet noise radiation\nassociated with the different noise suppression devices. The fourth objective was to conduct\njet plume (temperature and pressure) surveys on selected promising noise suppression\ndevices and to use these data to correlate with far-field jet noise measurements. The last and\nfifth objective was to explore the potential use of laser sheet and Schlieren imaging tests to\nobtain qualitative flow visualization images of the downstream mixing jets from the separate\nnozzle flows.\nP&W\xe2\x80\x99s test objective was a subset of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s overall objectives, and thus, was more limited\nin scope. P&W was to provide noise suppression devices for only one nozzle model with a\nbypass ratio of 5 and with an external plug (model 3). P&W was to evaluate and report on the\nresults of the suppression devices for model 3 only, and to report on the phased-array\nmicrophone source noise location/radiation results performed by the Boeing Company under\nsubcontract to P&W. P&W was to use the phased-array data and the jet plume survey results\nto help explain the noise characteristics of a few selected promising noise suppression\ndevices, and to demonstrate that these devices could achieve 3 EPNdB jet noise suppression.\nOther NASA test objectives will be addressed in a test report by GEAE under NAS3-27720,\nAoI 14.3.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n7\n\n3.1\n\nSEPARATE-FLOW BASELINE NOZZLE SOURCE LEVELS\nPREDICTION\n\nThe first step in deciding what design features are important to incorporate into the jet noise\nexternal suppressor designs was to determine what are the major noise source levels in the\n(nonmixed) separate-flow nozzle systems of the axisymmetric baseline nozzles. In the\nseparate-flow nozzle exhaust system where the primary and secondary jet flows are still\nwithin the subsonic Mach number range, the major noise sources could be identified as those\ngenerated from each of the two jet (primary and fan) flows and to the merged (mixed) flow.\nAn empirical model has been developed by the Boeing Aircraft Company (Ref. 3) for\npredicting the relative noise levels of these three sources for the separate-flow baseline\nnozzle coaxial jet. Using this empirical model, predictions of the source noise levels for\nmodel #3 (BPR=5, external plug) were made for a mixed jet velocity of 1155 ft/sec (core\nvelocity of 1585 ft/sec and fan velocity of 1070 ft/sec) which is typical for a current HBPR\nturbofan engine at sideline power. The predicted sound pressure level (SPL) spectra for the\nthree noise sources (primary, secondary and mixed jet) at four different far-field angles\n(measured with respect to the inlet) are shown in Figure 1. The predictions show the mixed\njet generated most of the low-frequency noise at almost every far-field angles except for the\nvery aft angle (150 degrees), and the secondary jet generated most of the high-frequency\nnoise at all far-field angles.\nFigure 2 shows the predicted corresponding perceived noise level (PNL) directivities for the\nprimary, secondary, mixed and total jet noise. As expected, the mixed jet component noise\ndominates, with the secondary jet noise at levels that are 5 PNdB lower. The primary jet\nnoise is again predicted to be only important at the very aft far-field angles (greater than 150\ndegrees).\nBased on this Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s coaxial jet empirical model for the baseline nozzle, it was decided\nthat the best strategy for suppressing the separate-flow nozzle jet noise was to promote better\nmixing between the primary and secondary jet to achieve more uniform and lower centerline\nvelocity for the mixed jet. The second strategy is to promote better mixing between the\nsecondary jet\xe2\x80\x99s outer shear layer and the ambient free-jet. The jet noise suppression devices\nthat P&W designed and incorporated into the model #3 (BPR=5, external plug) nozzle were\nfocused on these two strategies.\nThe mixing devices P&W designed for these noise tests were delta tabs, minilobes (half and\nfull mixers), scarfed fan nozzle and an offset centerline fan nozzle. The delta-tabs devices\nwhen placed between the core and fan nozzle act on the source noises from the primary and\nthe mixed jet and would reduce both the low and high frequencies from these two noise\nsources. Similarly, the devices when placed on the fan nozzle outer diameter would act on\nthe high frequency noise from the mixing of the fan jet shear layer and the ambient freejet. In\naddition, P&W also explored the use of a scarfed or scooped fan nozzle to shield the high\nfrequency noise that is generated close to the fan nozzle exit from propagating directly to the\nfar-field microphones. Another new concept that P&W investigated was the offset-centerline\nfan nozzle. The flow field of this asymmetric nozzle was predicted to be highly distorted\n(horse-shoe shaped flow pattern) with jet centerline velocities decaying at rates significantly\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n8\n\nhigher than that of the axisymmetric nozzle. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nanalyses of some of these unusual devices is presented in Section 4.1.3.\nGEAE designed chevrons and low profile vortex generators (arranged in doublets with the\nflat leading end of the ramps facing the flow) and AEC designed the tongue mixer.\nDescriptions of these and other suppression devices are presented below.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n9\n\n4.0\n\nNOZZLE MODELS DESCRIPTION, TEST FACILITY, TEST METHODS,\nDATA ACQUISITION AND REDUCTION PROCEDURES\n4.1\n\nNOZZLE MODELS DESCRIPTIONS\n4.1.1\n\nSEPARATE-FLOW NOZZLES (SFN) BASELINE MODELS\n\nThe baseline models are scaled versions (scale factor of 1.0224) of the baseline models being\ntested at NASA Langley. This scale factor was chosen so that these baseline nozzles would\nfit into the NASA Lewis NATR test rig. The estimated hot core nozzle and fan nozzle areas\nfor the six baseline models are summarized below :\nModel #\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nDescription\n\nCore Nozzle Area\n(sq. in)\n\nCoplanar (BPR=5)\nBPR=5, Internal Plug\nBPR=5, External Plug\nBPR=8, Internal Plug\nBPR=8, External Plug\nBPR~5, Modified Plug\n\n11.30\n11.19\n10.53\n7.96\n8.64\n7.96\n\nFan Nozzle Area\n(sq. in)\n29.58\n28.94\n28.94\n32.72\n32.72\n28.94\n\n4.1.1.1 Model #1, Coplanar, BPR=5, Internal Plug\nFigure 3 shows a picture of the Model 1, BPR=5, coplanar baseline nozzle. The fan nozzle\nhas the same nozzle exit plane as that of the primary nozzle. The cold dimensions are 3.753\ninches for the core nozzle exit diameter and 7.246 inches for the fan nozzle exit diameter.\nThe diameter of the internal plug (not visible in Figure 3) is 2.029 inch. Both the primary and\nthe fan nozzle have nozzle lip wall thickness of approximately 0.005 inches. No mixing\ndevices were tested on this model. The test purpose for this model is to provide a set of\nacoustic data for a coplanar baseline nozzle.\n4.1.1.2 Model #2, BPR=5, Internal Plug.\nFigure 4 shows a picture of the Model 2, BPR=5, internal plug baseline nozzle. The cold\ndimensions for the core and fan nozzle exit diameters are 3.753 inches and 9.629 inches,\nrespectively. The internal plug diameter is 2.029 inches (same as that of model 1). The core\nnozzle exit plane is approximately 7.081 inches downstream of the fan nozzle exit plane.\nA limited number of chevrons with and without vortex generators applied to the core and fan\nnozzle was tested on this model configuration.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n11\n\n4.1.1.3 Model #3, BPR=5, External Plug.\nFigure 5 shows a picture of the Model 3, BPR=5, external plug baseline nozzle. The cold\ndimensions for the core and fan nozzle exit diameters are 5.156 inches and 9.629 inches,\nrespectively. The core nozzle external plug is unique to Model 3. The plug has a maximum\ndiameter of 3.704 inches (cold) and a boattail angle of 16 degrees. The plug protrude from\nthe exit plane of the core nozzle by 5.355 inches. The fan nozzle exit plane is 4.267 inches\nupstream relative to the core nozzle exit plane. Except for the AEC\xe2\x80\x99s core nozzle tongue\nmixer, the majority of the flow mixing devices were tested on this model.\n4.1.1.4 Model #4, BPR=8, Internal Plug.\nFigure 6 shows a picture of the Model 4, BPR=8, internal plug baseline nozzle. The cold\ndimensions for the core and fan nozzle exit diameters are 3.165 inches and 9.629 inches,\nrespectively. The core nozzle exit plane is approximately 7.60 inches downstream of the fan\nnozzle exit plane. No mixing devices were tested on this model. The test purpose for this\nmodel is to provide a set of acoustic data for a BPR of 8, internal plug baseline nozzle.\n4.1.1.5 Model #5, BPR=8, External Plug.\nFigure 7 shows a picture of the Model 5, BPR=8, external plug baseline nozzle. The cold\ndimensions for the core and fan nozzle exit diameters are 4.827 inches and 9.629 inches,\nrespectively. The core nozzle exit plane is approximately 4.265 inches downstream of the fan\nnozzle exit plane. The centerbody (plug) for model 5 is the same as that of model 3. Only\nchevrons were tested with this model.\n4.1.1.6 Model #6, (Modified Plug for AEC\xe2\x80\x99s Tongue Mixer)\nFigure 8 shows a picture of the Model 6 with the internal plug modified for the AEC\xe2\x80\x99s core\nnozzle tongue mixer. The core and fan nozzles are the same as those for Model 2. No\nacoustic data were taken for this baseline configuration. When the core tongue mixer was\ntested in the original model 2 baseline configuration with a short internal plug, the core flow\nfor the tongue mixer was significantly higher than predicted, and the resultant BPR was less\nthan the desired value of 5. This configuration was built in an attempt to reduce the core flow\nfor the tongue mixer so that the BPR would be closer to the desired value. Figure 9 shows a\npicture of the tongue mixer with the modified extended plug in the model 6 configuration.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n12\n\n4.1.2\n\nMIXING ENHANCER DEVICES/CONCEPTS\n\nThe mixing devices selected for the SFN noise tests are (1) chevrons, (2) vortex generator\n(VG) doublets, (3) tongue mixer, (4) flipper tabs, (5) scarfed fan nozzle, (5) mini-lobed half\nmixer, (6) mini-lobed full mixer and (7) offset-centerline fan nozzle. Except for the tongue\nmixer, the exit nozzle areas of these devices are approximately the same as the nozzle exit\nareas of the baseline nozzles they replaced. Combinations of different core nozzle mixing\ndevices could be tested with different fan nozzle mixing devices without changing the basic\nBPR of the model tested. A detailed description of the design parameters of the various\nmixing devices can be found in Reference 1 (SFN test plan). As presented in the\nnomenclature, a total of 10 mixing devices were fabricated for the core nozzle and 8 devices\nfor the fan nozzle.\n4.1.2.1 Chevrons\nChevrons are serrated continuations of the nozzle trailing edge. These serrations are deep and\nare relatively bigger than tabs. The chevrons, designed by GEAE, could be neutral or\ndirected inward or alternatively inward and outward at a small angle (5 degrees) . These\nGEAE\xe2\x80\x99s supplied chevron nozzles are shown in Figures 10 through 14 for (a) a eight (8)\nneutral-chevrons core nozzle, (b) a twelve (12) neutral chevrons core nozzle, (c) a twelve\n(12) inward-chevrons core nozzle, (d) a twelve (12) alternating inward- and outwardchevrons core nozzle and (e) a twenty four (24) neutral-chevrons fan nozzle. The parameters\nused to describe the chevrons are given in Reference 1.\n4.1.2.2 Vortex Generators (VG) Doublets\nThe vortex generators doublets selected by GEAE for the SFN noise test consist of tandem\nwedges with the flat bases of the ramps facing the flow. Figure 15 shows a picture of the\narrangement of twenty (20) VG doublets installed on the outer surface near the exit plane of a\ncore nozzle. Figures 16 and 17 show two similar VG doublets arrangements on the inner\nsurfaces of a core nozzle and a fan nozzle. The design parameters for these vortex generators\nare described in Reference 1.\n4.1.2.3 Tongue Mixer\nThe AEC\xe2\x80\x99 s tongue mixer design showed in Figure 18 has the shape of a 12-lobe mixer with\nthe side walls cut off, leaving only the crowns and crests to direct the core flow inward and\noutward to increase mixing between the core and fan streams. This device was tested in\nModel 2 only. When first tested, the tongue mixer does not produce the correct bypass ratio\nas the baseline model and a second modified centerbody (plug) was built which reduced the\ncore flow and raised the bypass ratio closer to that of the baseline model. A detailed\ndescription of the tongue mixer design is given in Reference 1.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n13\n\n4.1.2.4 Flipper Tabs\nThe P&W\xe2\x80\x99s flipper tabs are small delta tabs which are continuations of the nozzle exit\ntrailing edge. The tabs are arranged in a repeating sequence consisting of an up tab/neutral\ntab/down tab/neutral tab. Twenty-four (24) and forty-eight (48) tabs configurations were\nprovided by P&W for both the core and fan nozzles of Model 3. The inner and outer surfaces\nof each tab are circular arcs as measured in the streamwise directions. Figures 19 through 22\nshow the 24- and 48-tabs configurations for the core and the fan nozzles.\n4.1.2.5 Scarfed Fan Nozzle\nFigure 23 shows a picture of the P&W designed scarfed fan nozzle which has a 120-degrees\ncircumferential segment that extend from the original nozzle exit plane. This segment or\nscoop can be clocked at different positions relative to the far-field microphones. As shown in\nFigure 24, the scarfed fan nozzle could be tested with different core nozzle suppression\ndevices to add an additional suppression effect due to the scoop\xe2\x80\x99s line of sight blocking of the\nhigh frequency noise generated close to the nozzle exit plane.\n4.1.2.6 Half Core Mixer Nozzle\nFigure 25 shows a picture of the P&W designed half core mixer with 10 mini-lobes over a\n180 degrees circumferential segment and a regular baseline circular nozzle over the\nremaining 180 degrees. This half mixer was tested at different clocking positions with the\nlobed half of the mixer facing at 0 degrees (towards), at 90 degrees and at 180 degrees\n(away) from the far-field microphones.\n4.1.2.7 Full Core Mixer Nozzle\nFigure 26 shows the P&W designed full core mixer with 20 mini-lobes over the entire\ncircumference.\n4.1.2.8 Offset Centerline Fan Nozzle\nThis nozzle design was selected based on recommendations from the Boeing Aircraft\nCompany who is a subcontractor to P&W under the AST contract. The centerline position of\nthe fan nozzle was offset by an amount described as a Cosine function (Reference 1). The\nnozzle retains the same circular cross-sections as the baseline nozzle at each axial distance\nalong the centerline of the nozzle. A picture of the offset-centerline fan nozzle is shown in\nFigure 27. CFD flow field analyses of this unusual nozzle design is presented in Section\n4.1.3. This fan nozzle was tested with the core baseline nozzle and the Half core mixer\nnozzle.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n14\n\n4.1.2.9 Core and Fan Suppression Devices Combination\nNozzles\nFigures 28 through 40 show pictures on various combinations of different core suppression\ndevices tested with different fan suppression devices on Model 3. These combination nozzle\nconfigurations are denoted by a three digit code as explained in the nomenclature. For\nexample, configuration 3T48T48 is a model 3 nozzle with a 48-flipper-tabbed core nozzle\nand a 48-flipper-tabbed fan nozzle. All the combination nozzles tested have approximately\nthe same BPR as the baseline Model 3 nozzle.\nCross-section descriptions of the model hardware configurations are provided in Appendix B.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n15\n\n4.1.3\n\nCFD ANAYSES FOR SELECTED NOZZLE DESIGNS\n\nConventional nozzle design processes apply empirical rules and CFD analyses. A key design\ncriterion of these analyses has been to reduce the peak levels of velocity and temperature at\nthe nozzle exit plane. UTRC/P&W uses NASTAR, its internally developed, general-purpose\nNavier-Stokes viscous flow analysis to design mixer/nozzle configurations. The NASTAR\ncode is based on Rhie\xe2\x80\x99s method (Ref. 4) and it represents a significant extension of the\npressure-correction methodology used in the TEACH family of codes (Ref. 5). The code\nsolves the Reynolds-averaged form of the governing equations for steady, three-dimensional\nflows including the effects of turbulence and heat release due to chemical reaction. The\ngoverning equations are approximated using a finite-volume method. The discretized\ncontinuity and momentum equations are used to derive a pressure-correction equation that is\nused in place of the continuity equation. Rhie's method provides a single-cell, general\ncurvilinear coordinate procedure that is applicable for Mach numbers ranging from\nincompressible flow to hypersonic flow. The results described in the current study were\nobtained using the two equation (k- ) model for turbulence due to Jones and Launder (Ref.\n6).\n4.1.3.1 Model #3 Baseline (Axisymmetric) Nozzle\nThe first high-bypass-ratio (BPR \xe2\x89\x88 5) configuration analyzed was the model #3 axisymmetric\nbaseline nozzle. All calculations described in this report have been performed at conditions\nrepresenting a take-off condition (M\xe2\x88\x9e = 0.3). By assuming that radial profiles of the flow\nproperties were flat at the inlet plane, the flow boundary conditions specified are shown on\ntable below.\nHBPR CFD Inlet Boundary Conditions\nPrimary total temperature\nFan total temperature\nFreestream total temperature\nPrimary total pressure\nFan total pressure\nFreestream total pressure\n\n= 1491 R\n= 647 R (600 R actual)\n= 524 R\n= 3183.8 psfa (22.1 psia) (24.0 psia actual)\n= 3714.5 psfa (25.8 psia) (26.1 psia actual)\n= 2172.4 psfa (15.1 psia)\n\nThe baseline axisymmetric geometry was analyzed at P&W using a two-dimensional\ncomputational grid of 273 by 129, with grid clustering near the wall to allow modeling the\nviscous near-wall behavior by integrating directly to the wall (i.e., thereby eliminating use of\nwall functions).\nAnalyses of CFD predicted performance of nozzle exhaust systems are usually expressed in\nterms of lateral displays of the axial velocity (U), total temperature (To) and/or Mach number\n(M) at the nozzle exit plane. For the current study, cross-planar color contour plots of the\naxial velocity distribution at planes located downstream of the centerbody trailing edge (x/D\n= 0.0) and at x/D = 6.0 are shown in Figure 41. The axial distance has been\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n16\n\nnormalized by the fan nozzle trailing edge diameter (D). The high-speed region (dark red)\nshows little jet velocity decay over this range. Comparisons with the results from other\nnozzle analyses are presented below.\n4.1.3.2 Model #3 Scarfed Fan Nozzle\nFor the three-dimensional calculations discussed here, it was necessary to use wall functions\nto keep the number of computational nodes manageable. These grids had law-of-the-wall y+\nvalues ranging from about 100 to 200 on the various surfaces; these values were within the\nacceptable range for using wall functions.\nThe design of the fan-scarfed nozzle added an extension to the lower fan nozzle trailing edge\nto prevent the downward radiation of noise generated from a portion of the fan nozzle and\nprimary nozzle flows. The fan nozzle contour was generated by initially defining an\naxisymmetric geometry, extending the fan nozzle such that the primary nozzle was internal.\nThe extended fan nozzle was then cut away from the upper 180 degrees (from +90 degrees to\n-90 degrees from top-dead center TDC). The extended fan nozzle was further sliced from the\naxisymmetric trailing edge at +90 degrees to the extended nozzle trailing edge at +120\ndegrees, thereby producing a scarfed section. The same was repeated from -90 degrees to\n-120 degrees. No attempt was made to fillet any corner produced by these modifications.\nThe three-dimensional exhaust system was analyzed by taking advantage of the vertical plane\nof symmetry. Figure 42 shows velocity contours from the 3D calculation. The image is an\n\xe2\x80\x9cupside down\xe2\x80\x9d mirror image; that is, the flow in the top half of the figure is closer to the\nground. There is a small region of transonic flow under the upper fan nozzle, where the\nextension has been added. The region recompresses with little loss incurred. The air flows are\nwithin 2.0% and 0.2% for the primary and fan streams, respectively. The change in the\nprimary flow is probably due to the change in \xe2\x80\x9csuppression\xe2\x80\x9d of the primary stream by the fan\nstream. The extended nozzle provides some relief to the primary stream that the\naxisymmetric nozzle does not.\n4.1.3.3 Model #3 Core Half Mixer\nThe proposed half mixer design modifies the primary flow cowl from a completely\naxisymmetric surface (splitter) into a 180-degree splitter surface (oriented top-dead center)\nand a ten-lobed mixer (oriented bottom-dead center). The mixer consists of ten full-sized\nlobes and two reduced-size lobes for blending at 90 and 270 degrees to the axisymmetric\nsplitter. Analyzing such a configuration, even after assuming one plane of symmetry, is a\nprodigious calculation. Therefore, an analysis of the core full mixer configuration (i.e., with\nlobes along the full circumference) was performed; thus, it was then possible to restrict the\ncomputational domain to planes of symmetry at the lobe crest and lobe trough. Two lobed\nmixers configurations were considered during the design phase, (1) a low-penetration design\nand (2) a high-penetration design. Analysis of these configurations were performed (1) to\ndetermine if the designs achieved the correct flow splits (bypass ratio, BPR) with no flow\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n17\n\nproblem areas (e.g., separation, supersonic flow), and (2) to assess the mixedness of the\ndesign, relative to the axisymmetric baseline.\nIn both situations, an analysis of a mixer lobe was performed. Symmetry was assumed and\nthe analysis of only one-half of a lobe was required. A computational grid of dimensions 273\nby 129 by 33 (1,162,000) nodes was generated using the UTRC-developed MKBLOX grid\ngeneration software system. Dimensions and grid node distributions were chosen to\napproximate the grid in the analysis of the baseline separate-flow system. The grid node\ndistributions were also selected to provide a simple means of reducing the size of the grid\nindependently in each of the coordinate directions. Therefore, it was possible to develop a\ngrid of one-quarter the number of grid nodes by removing every other grid line in the radial\nand circumferential directions and to develop a grid with only one-eight the number of grid\nlines by removing every other line in each of the coordinate directions. In this manner, a\nmeans was provided to test both the grid independence of solutions and to reduce turnaround\ntime for the cases. In addition, a coarser grid permitted analysis of blended configurations in\nwhich the computational domain was necessarily larger due to the absence of periodic and\nsymmetry boundaries. For example, an analysis of the complete full mixer design was\nachieved by considering a full 180 degree segment. An example of a grid with one-quarter\nthe number of grid nodes is shown for a slice through a lobe crest in Figure 43. Here, every\nother axial and radial grid is shown.\nInspection for regions of supersonic flow: Of concern is the fact that the core mixer\ndesigns may produce regions of supersonic flow with correspondingly large total pressure\nlosses. All converged solutions were inspected for regions of supersonic flow. For all cases\nother than the high-penetration design, the maximum Mach number anywhere in the flow\nfield was 1.03 to 1.06, depending on the case considered. Generally, these zones appeared as\nnarrow strips of transonic flow and can probably be safely neglected because of their small\nextent.\nFor the high-penetration case, the maximum Mach number was 1.25. Color contour plots of\nthe velocity field in both the crest and trough cut planes for this case are presented in Figure\n44. The small reddish region in the crest cut indicates the limited region of sonic flow. This\nhigher penetration mixer apparently accelerates the flow to the transonic range. Figure 45\npresents similar views for the total temperature field. These displays show little attenuation\nof the hot primary flow as the exhaust jet mixes downstream.\nDisplay of flow field evolution: Evolution of the flow field, as a result of the mixer, is\npresented in Figure 46, where color contours of the total temperature are displayed at a plane\ncutting the engine exhaust at the trailing edge of the centerbody (x/D = 0.). Although only a\nhalf-lobe has been analyzed, the results have been reflected about the plane of symmetry and\nthen replicated twenty times to obtain the circumferential view shown; i.e. the mixer\nsimulation assumed the lobe geometry was fully periodic and not restricted to a 180 segment.\nThe flow field exhibits the classic kidney shaped pattern produced by the generation of\nstreamwise vorticity from the convoluted surface of the mixer. Figure 47 shows a similar\nview for the axial velocity at x/D = 0 and at x/D = 6. The axial velocity shows little of the\nhigh speed flow seen in the axisymmetric calculation (Figure 41), and by x/D=6 additional\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n18\n\nmixing has substantially reduced the peak velocity level. The axial velocity variable shows\nlittle of the kidney shaped patterns at x/D = 0. while the downstream plane is almost\naxisymmetric.\nEffect of mixer design: Axial velocity and total temperature contours for the lowpenetration design using the revised grid and the high-penetration design are compared at\nthe end of the centerbody in Figure 48. These results are also displayed in the enlarged\nformat, and only a half lobe view of each calculation is displayed. The sector angle for the\nhigh-penetration design is smaller than that of the low-penetration case. Therefore, the\nrelatively larger contribution of shear-layer mixing for the high penetration core mixer\nproduces substantially more mixing at this axial location.\nTests for grid independence: Computational studies were performed on the low-penetration\ncore mixer nozzle to assess the adequacy of the computational grid used. Parametric\nvariations were performed on a grid with every second axial and radial grid line removed.\nComparisons of axial velocity and total temperature at the end of the plug were made with\nlittle qualitative difference observed. The level of mixing appears to be the same for these\ncases, but the distribution at this axial location differs. The results for the densest grid show\ngreater mixing, suggesting that factors (as yet unidentified) other than numerical diffusion\nmay be important here. The high resolution grid, however, would be needed for any\nperformance assessment calculation.\n4.1.3.4 Model #3 Fan Offset Centerline Nozzle\nThe fan offset centerline nozzle modifies the primary flow cowl from a completely\naxisymmetric surface (splitter) by displacing it vertically downward from top-dead center.\nTwo different displacements, denoted medium and maximum were considered. Calculations\nwere performed by assuming symmetry about the vertical axis. A computational grid of\ndimensions 129 by 91 by 33 (387,000) was generated using the UTRC- developed MKBLOX\ngrid generation software system. Dimensions and grid node distributions were chosen to\napproximate the grid in the analysis of the baseline separate-flow system.\nEffect of nozzle offset: Full color contour circumferential views of the axial velocity at the\ncenterbody trailing edge plane (x/D=0.0) and at x/D=6.0 are shown on Figure 49. The level\nof peak axial velocity is reduced to the level seen in the core mixer case (Figure 47). A direct\ncomparison of the fan offset centerline nozzle flow field to the baseline axisymmetric nozzle\nis shown in Figure 50. Total temperature contours are evaluated at planes distributed from\nx/D = 0. to 11. The effect of the offset clearly produces a crossflow structure (kidney\npattern) associated with the generation of streamwise vorticity. The effect of the streamwise\nvorticity on the total temperature field produces an almost mixed out flow by x/D = 11.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n19\n\n4.2\n\nTEST FACILITY AND TEST METHODS\n\nThe noise and microphone phased array testing part of the SFNT program were conducted in\nthe NASA LeRC\xe2\x80\x99s Aeroacoustic Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) from the 20th of March to\nthe 18th of June. The facility was then shutdown for a previously scheduled two week period\nfor maintenance. Nozzle exit flow plume survey testing were then conducted following the\nrestart of the facility. The AAPL is consisted of the Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR) and\nthe 65-foot radius Anechoic Hemispherical Dome. Far-field acoustic data were measured\nusing a 48-foot radius microphone array centered at the test nozzle exit plane. P&W\nsubcontracted the Boeing Aircraft Company to provide the phased array measurement\nequipment and to conduct the acquisition and processing of the phased array data. A detailed\ndescription of the test facility, test procedures, acoustic data acquisition and reduction has\nbeen presented in the test plan (Reference 1) and in previously published reports of\nReferences 6, 7 and 12. However, for completeness of this test report, sections of the\ndescriptions of the test facility reproduced (verbatim) from the test plan are included below.\n4.2.1\n\nNozzle Acoustic Test Rig (NATR)\n\nThe NATR is consisted of the 53-inch diameter free-jet duct section and the Jet Exit Rig\n(JER). The free-jet is driven by an annular air ejector system that entrains ambient air\nthrough a plenum and a transition bellmouth section and expels the air through a 53-inch\ninner diameter free-jet duct with a centerline height of 120 inches. The system can produce\nfree-jet Mach numbers up to 0.3. Downstream of the free-jet duct exit plane is the Jet Exit\nRig. The JER is the structure through which airflows are delivered to the core and fan\nnozzles via connections to the facility\xe2\x80\x99s compressed air supply systems. The core nozzle\nairflow is heated by a combustor using hydrogen as fuel. The fan nozzle airflow is heated by\nelectric heaters. Exhaust gases from the free-jet and jet rig are expelled through the 43 ft high\nby 55 ft wide exhaust door downstream of the jet rig. A 60-inch diameter exhaust fan in the\ntop of the dome provides air circulation. Figure 51 shows a picture of the NATR and the\nacoustic anechoic test arena.\n4.2.2\n\nAnechoic Test Area\n\nThe anechoic test arena is a 65-ft radius hemispherical dome. The walls of the dome and half\nthe floor area are treated with acoustic wedges. The untreated half of the floor, occupied by\nthe Power Lift Rig (PLR), has an acoustically treated wall installed near the NATR exit plane\nand extending aft along the untreated floor to shield unwanted sound reflections from the\nuntreated floor area and other test equipment. The floor area in front of the test nozzle are\ntreated with wedges prior to actual acoustic data acquisition. Microphones for the acoustic\ndata acquisition are located along a 48-ft radius arc centered at the exit plane of the test\nnozzle. These microphones are mounted on 10-ft poles bolted to the floor. The angle\nlocations for the microphones are from 50 to 160 degrees, at every 5 degrees interval. Figure\n52 shows a picture of the 48-ft radius microphone array.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n20\n\n4.2.3\n\nFacility Instrumentation\n\nThe NATR/JER instrumentation provides data on test variables such as free-jet Mach\nnumber, fan nozzle pressure ratio, core nozzle pressure ratio, fan flow temperature and core\nflow temperature, and airflow rates for the core and fan nozzles. The facility is not\nconfigured for nozzle thrust measurements. Four (4) total pressure/temperature rakes are\ninstalled at the charging stations of the core and fan ducts of the jet exit rig. The four radial\nrakes are spaced 90 degrees apart, and each rake has five (5) total pressure and five (5) total\ntemperature sensors. The instrumentation system can display all twenty individual values and\nan averaged value for the total pressure and temperature. Flow venturis located in the\ncompressed air supply lines give the flow rates of the core and fan flows.\n4.2.4\n\nAcoustic Test Matrix and Test Variables\n\nThe test matrix and the power setting parameters (i.e. core and fan nozzle temperatures and\npressures) were selected to provide some common cycle points with the AST jet noise test\nscheduled for the NASA Langley Research Center. Further refinements were made to the test\nplan as the test progressed. The most significant modification was to set the fan nozzle\ntemperature at a constant 600 degrees Rankine for all power settings (instead of varying the\nfan nozzle temperature from 560 to 660 for low to high power). This modification reduced\nsignificantly the amount of time required to set each test point. The second modification was\nto reduce the number of nozzle configurations that required testing at all three freejet Mach\nnumbers (i.e. 0.0, 0.2 and 0.28). This reduced the number of configurations that were tested\nat all three Mach numbers to those of the baseline nozzles and to the most promising mixer\ndevices. All others were tested at test points limited to the Lewis Cycle-2 (5 points at Mach\nnumber of 0.28, 1 common point at 0.2 and 1 common point at 0.0). This common point is pt.\n#21 of the Lewis Cycle-2. (This test point is equivalent to the sideline power of a typical\naircraft powered by two HBPR engines). The effect of freejet Mach number on the jet noise\nreduction of the mixer devices were evaluated using pt #21 tested at three Mach numbers.\nThe third modification to the test plan was to add a sixth cycle (Cycle-6) test points to one\nGE\xe2\x80\x99s nozzle mixer (3IC) for Escort runs 906 through 913. The test condition parameters for\nCycle-1 through Cycle-6 are listed in Table 1.\n4.2.5\n\nTest Methods\n\nNASA Lewis was responsible for the acquisition and the reduction of the noise data. Prior to\nthe start of the noise tests, a facility shakedown was initiated and several facility associated\nnoise sources were noted. These were 1) pipe noise from the newly designed secondary air\nsupply system and 2) \xe2\x80\x9cvortex shedding\xe2\x80\x9d tones from the airfoil-shaped struts in the NATR\nairflow. These extraneous noise source were eliminated by installing a muffler in the\nsecondary air supply system and wrapping the pipes with dense foam, and by wrapping the\nairfoil-shaped struts with fine wires running fore and aft from leading to trailing edges.\nFurther descriptions of the test procedures are described below.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n21\n\n4.2.5.1 Acoustic Testing\nNoise data were taken for the baseline nozzle Models 1 through 5 at three freejet Mach\nnumbers (0.0, 0.20 and 0.28) and at power settings duplicating some of those to be tested at\nthe NASA LaRC Jet Noise Facility. The data from these baseline nozzles were to be used by\nNASA to compare Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s and Langley\xe2\x80\x99s jet noise test facilities acoustic data acquisition\nand reduction systems. The power settings (core and fan nozzle pressure ratios, core and fan\nnozzle temperatures) for each baseline model were selected based on a composite of current\nturbofan engine cycles from different engine companies. Model 1 (BPR=5, Coplanar) and\nModel 2 (BPR=5, internal plug) were tested at power settings specified in cycles 1, 2 and 5.\nModel 3 (BPR=5, external plug) was tested at cycles 1 and 2. Model 4 (BPR=8, internal\nplug) and Model 5 (BPR=8, external plug) were tested at cycles 3 and 4. The majority of the\njet noise mixer/suppression devices were for Model 3. These devices were tested at cycle 2,\nwith the exception of 3IC which was also tested at cycle 6.\nRepeat points of the baseline nozzle was taken each day for adjusting the absolute levels due\nto ambient temperature variations from test day to test day.\n4.2.5.2 Phased-Array Microphone Testing\nThe following section describing the phased-array technique and beamforming comes\ndirectly from Reference 8 and is included within this document because it provides a good\ndescription of the procedure.\nBeamforming is the name given to a variety of array processing algorithms that focus the\narray\xe2\x80\x99s signal-capturing abilities in a particular direction. The principle behind phased arrays\nis straightforward: if a signal is propagated to an array of sensors and each sensor\xe2\x80\x99s signal is\ndelayed by an appropriate amount and added together with appropriately delayed signals\nfrom other sensors, the source signal is reinforced with respect to the noise. The delays that\nreinforce the signal are directly related to the length of time it takes the signal to propagate\nbetween sensors. As shown in Figure 53, due to different paths to each microphone it will\ntake different amounts of time for the source signal to reach each microphone. By delaying\neach microphone\xe2\x80\x99s measured signals by an appropriate amount and adding together the\ndelayed signals from all microphones, an enhanced signal can be obtained as shown in Figure\n54.\nThe first question is how much delay is needed to get an enhanced signal. Delays are chosen\nby picking target points in space where possible noise sources might exist. The time required\nfor a signal from an acoustic source at that target point to travel to each microphone is then\ncalculated. This time can be calculated through classical acoustic formulas or through raytracing codes. Delays for each microphone signal are then calculated such that an enhanced\nsignal would be obtained if a source was actually located at the target point. If a source was\nat the target point, an enhanced signal, such as that shown in Figure 54, would be calculated.\nHowever, if no noise source was at the target point, but was instead at some other point in\nspace, then the delays do not cause the signals to add together in a constructive fashion.\nInstead the signals will tend to destructively add together and cause a small signal output as\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n22\n\nshown in Figure 55. In practice all of these computations are done in the frequency domain\nand \xe2\x80\x9ctime delays\xe2\x80\x9d between microphones are in fact phase differences, but the premise is the\nsame. By examining many target points, the actual source locations can be found.\nThere are two major benefits to using phased arrays. First, by examining many target points\non and around the test object, noise source locations can be found. Second, the array makes\nit possible to acquire acoustic data in locations where it was previously impossible due to\nsignal-to-noise problems. It would be extremely difficult or impossible to acquire acoustic\ndata near a source region in a jet. The flow noise on the microphone would overwhelm any\nacoustic signal.\nTest setup\nA picture of the test setup is shown in Figure 56. Three arrays were used during the testing.\nTwo of the arrays were planar arrays which were designed and built for an earlier airframe\nnoise test and were contained within the box below the nozzle shown in Figure 56. The\nmicrophone cables could be seen coming out of the back side of the box. The third array, a\nlinear array, was located at the sideline position. It was designed and built for this test and\nwas added in case there were signal-to-noise problems with the planar arrays. As it turned\nout, the two-dimensional planar arrays performed well and the one-dimensional linear array\nwas barely used. A description of each array is included below.\nLarge 7-arm Logarithmic Spiral Array\nThe large 7-arm logarithmic spiral array can determine source density in three dimensions,\nalthough with poor resolution in depth because of the array\xe2\x80\x99s limited aperture. This array,\nwhich was designed for resolving low frequency sources (1-10 kHz), is a 63-element multiarm spiral array with a 29-inch outer radius and 2-inch inner radius (see Figure 57). The\nelements are distributed, 9 each, along seven identical spiral arms so as to maintain\napproximately uniform area density of sensors across the array. The innermost circle of this\narray was replaced with the second to the innermost circle from the small planar array\n(described below) so that the two arrays could share some elements thereby reducing the\nnumber of sensors required for the test. This array, as well as the small 7-arm spiral array,\nwere tested below the nozzle at approximately 90 degrees and then moved downstream and\nrotated towards the noise sources at approximately 120 degrees as shown in Figure 56.\nMore detailed information (e.g. the peak sidelobe levels or beamwidth) of logarithmic spiral\narrays versus conventional arrays can be found in References 9 and 10.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n23\n\nSmall 7 arm Logarithmic Spiral Array\nThe small planar array, which was designed for resolving high frequency sources (8-80 kHz),\nis a 49-element multi-arm spiral array with a 6-inch outer radius and 0.75-inch inner radius.\nThe elements are distributed, 7 each, along seven identical spiral arms so as to maintain\napproximately uniform area density of sensors across the array (see Figure 58). Two of the\noutermost elements in this array were not used due to data acquisition system configuration\nlimitations.\nOne-Dimensional Linear Array\nA 1-D linear array was designed and tested for this test. The array remained at the sideline\nposition at approximately 90 degrees. The 28-element linear array was 48 inches in length.\nIt was designed to work across a broad range of frequencies (1-50 kHz) by using an element\ndistribution strategy that guarantees non-redundant spacing (i.e., no two pairs of microphones\nin the array are separated by the same distance).\nA picture of the array is shown in Figure 59. The microphones were mounted in a board at\ngrazing incidence to the jet source thus reducing any microphone incidence effects. The face\nof the board was covered with a strip of Nomex felt to reduce any reflections from the board\nto the microphones.\nDescription of the Test Conditions for Phased-Array Testing\nOne hundred forty two data points were taken for three different arrays for the 31 test\nconfigurations/array locations shown in Table 2.\nThe nozzles were tested along Cycle-2 operating line chosen by NASA, GE and PW to have\napproximately the same bypass and core nozzle pressure ratios typical of current engine\nnozzle designs. Points 21 and 23 were typical of a sideline and a cutback condition,\nrespectively.\nCycle-2, BPR=5 Power Settings for Phased-Array Measurements\nPoint (Equiv.\nCondition)\n20\n21 (Sideline)\n22\n23 (Cutback)\n24\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\nFan\nPressure\nRatio\n1.890\n1.830\n1.730\n1.600\n1.510\n\nFan\nTotal\nTemp R\n600\n600\n600\n600\n600\n\nCore\nPressure\nRatio\n1.790\n1.680\n1.510\n1.350\n1.270\n\n24\n\nCore\nTotal\nTemp R\n1540\n1500\n1420\n1345\n1300\n\n4.2.5.3 Nozzle Exit Flow Plume Survey Testing\nFlow plume survey investigations were conducted on selected nozzle configurations at\nlimited power settings (Cycle-2, points 21 and 23). The surveys were conducted along the jet\ncenterline and at several lateral horizontal positions for several axial distances downstream of\nthe jet. The plume survey rake assembly itself contains four (4) rakes. The left outboard rake\nis spaced approximately 4.28 inches from the centerline of the rake assembly and this rake\ncontains 41 total pressure sensors. The left inboard rake is 1.28 inches from the rake\nassembly centerline and this rake contains 41 total temperature sensors. The next two rakes\n(i.e. the right outboard and inboard rakes) contain static pressure sensors only. Figure 60\nshows a picture of the Plume Survey Rake Apparatus. Typically, a plume survey is generated\nby traversing the rake assembly in 0.25 inches lateral increments. Further details of the\nprocedure are described in Reference 1.\n4.3\n\nDATA ACQUISITION AND REDUCTION METHODS\n4.3.1\n\nAcoustic Data Acquisition and Reduction Method\n\nThe test plan (Reference 1) described the NASA LeRC acoustic data processing scheme that\ndigitizes the raw data and corrects them for microphone pistonphone calibrations, actuator\nfrequency responses, free-field and grid cap frequency responses, analogy filter roll-off, freejet shear layer refraction corrections, atmospheric attenuation at test day condition over test\ndistance corrections, spherical spreading attenuation corrections, and scaling the data to fullscale (scale factor of 8) and 150-ft radius. (For test points simulating flight conditions, the\nfreejet background noise were subtracted from the measured acoustic data before corrections\nwere applied). Figure 61 shows a flowchart of how the acoustic data is processed. NASA\nprovided Block V data which was used for this report.\nThe acoustic and aerodymanic performance (mass flow rates, nozzle discharge coefficients)\ndata along with test condition (total temperatures, total pressures and calculated jet velocities\nand ideal net thrust) information were also recorded in each data file which is identified by an\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscort\xe2\x80\x9d number and a nozzle configuration number.\n4.3.1.1 150-Ft Radius (FullScale) Sound Pressure Level (SPL)\nSpectral Data\nThe first set of data were 1/3-octave band SPL spectral data scaled up to a 8-scale factor and\nprojected to a 150-ft radius distance. These data were corrected to the acoustic standard day\ncondition, 77 deg. F and 70 % relative humidity. These data were identified as \xe2\x80\x9cPfiles\xe2\x80\x9d data\nby NASA Lewis.\n4.3.1.2 1500-Ft (FullScale) Flyover SPL Spectral Data and\nEffective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) Calculations\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n25\n\nThe second set of data were 1/3-octave SPL spectral data obtained by extrapolating the 150ft-radius SPL data to a 1500-ft level flyover. These data were calculated using NASA\nLeRC\xe2\x80\x99s methods to account for relative flight velocity, Doppler effect, spherical spreading\nattenuation, NOY weighting, summation and tone corrections, and duration corrections..\nAccompanying these 1/3-octave band SPL spectral data are the calculated Perceived Noise\nLevel (PNL) and the Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL) values. These data were\nidentified as \xe2\x80\x9cTfiles\xe2\x80\x9d data by NASA Lewis.\n4.3.2\n\nPhased-Array Microphone Jet Noise Source Location Data\nReduction Method\n\nThe microphone signals were digitized to a hard-disk in real-time using the Boeing Digital\nData System 3 (DDS3). During breaks in testing (e.g., model changes), the data was\nuploaded and processed on the NASA LeRC LACE cluster on 11 dedicated parallel nodes.\nThe output of the parallel processing were cross-correlation matrices that were then further\nprocessed to give beamformed SPLs at different locations defined in a grid.\nA NASA LeRC supplied SGI computer with the FAST program was used for viewing the\nprocessed data and creating color postscript files of the beamformed images.\nCalibration of the Arrays with and without Tunnel Flow\nPhased arrays work by accurately knowing phase differences (equivalent to time-delays)\nbetween relative microphones for a signal from a given source location. Bias errors can be\npresent in both the amplitude and phase that can blur the beamformed images. To insure the\nquality of the images, a phase calibration of the microphones is done for a source at a known\nlocation. Then the phase errors are determined and applied to the measured jet noise data to\nremove the bias errors.\nIn order to account for the propagation of sound through the tunnel's moving flow and\nthrough a shear layer, the beamforming program uses a ray tracing algorithm to calculate the\npath lengths to each microphone. To insure that this procedure works properly, a known\nsource is placed inside the tunnel near the noise source. For this test, two deer whistles were\ntaped on the outside of the secondary nozzle as shown in Figure 62. The tunnel was brought\nup to speed which caused the whistles to make noise. Beamforming was performed to show\nthat sources could be found and that they were at the proper location.\n4.3.3\n\nNozzle Exit Plume Survey Data Reduction Method\n4.3.3.1 Jet Pressures, Temperatures and Axial Velocity Profiles\n\nThe plume measurements are static and total pressures and gas total temperatures as function\nof the lateral and axial locations. At a given axial location, the rake assembly traversed in\n0.25 inch increments and each sweep of the survey cover the entire cross-section of the jet\nplume and some of the freejet flow. A map consisting of values of static pressures, total\npressures and gas temperatures together with grid points lateral and axial coordinates is\ngenerated. First, jet Mach numbers are calculated from the static and total pressures, and jet\nvelocities are then calculated from the jet Mach numbers and gas temperatures. Post-\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n26\n\nprocessing of the plume survey data and creating color image postscript files of pressure,\ntemperature and jet velocity contours were done by Dr. James Bridges of NASA Lewis.\n5.0\n\nDISCUSSIONS OF TEST RESULTS\n5.1\n\nEPNL SUMMARY FOR All SFN TEST CONFIGURATIONS\n\nTable 4 presents a summary of the calculated Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL)\nvalues (for a 1500-ft-level flyover) and the corresponding Escort numbers for all the nozzle\nconfigurations tested. Also included in the summary are the ideal mixed jet velocity (Vmix)\nand the ideal net thrust (Fn), calculated using the mixed flow mass and momentum equations.\nThese EPNL values are for a scaled-up nozzle of scale factor of 8. As shown in Table 4, there\nare several repeat runs of the model 3 baseline nozzle taken over a period of 11 weeks. The\nambient test day temperatures varied from 35 to 74 deg. F. Figure 63(a) shows a correlation\nof the 1500-ft level flyover EPNLs (normalized by Fn, the ideal thrust) plotted against mixed\njet velocities (Vmix), and Figure 63(b) shows the same correlation (with the ambient test day\ntemperature correction) in the form of EPNLs against mixed jet Mach number (Vmix/C0)\nwhere Vmix is again the mixed jet velocity and C0 is the ambient speed of sound. As shown\nin Figure 63(b), the data scatter for the EPNL correlation when corrected for ambient test day\ntemperature is significantly reduced. For this reason, all EPNL correlations presented in this\nreport would be EPNLs versus mixed jet Mach numbers. The third order least square fit\ncurve shown in Figure 63(b) represents the typical model 3 baseline nozzle EPNL versus\nmixed jet Mach number correlation.\n5.1.1\n\nResults for Model 3 Baseline Nozzle\n\nAll spectra reflect fullscale jet noise assuming a scale factor of 8. Figure 64 shows a\ncomparison of the measured and Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s JEN6 predicted SPL spectra for the Model 3\nbaseline nozzle at mixed jet velocity of 1155 ft/sec. The comparison shows good agreement\nbetween measured and predicted spectra for all far-field angles, which indicates that the\nindividual jet source levels predicted by JEN6 as described in Figure 1, are reasonably\naccurate, and that the noise from the mixed jet is probably the dominant noise source for the\nseparate-flow nozzle.\n5.1.1.1 Effects of Freejet Mach Number on Baseline Nozzle\nNoise Levels\nFigure 65 shows the effect of the freejet Mach number on the EPNL versus Jet Mach number\ncorrelations for Model 3 baseline nozzle. EPNL values decrease with increasing freejet Mach\nnumbers. Figure 66 shows the effect of the freejet Mach number on PNL directivities for a\nmixed jet velocity of 1155 ft/sec. The PNL directivities become flatter with increasing freejet\nMach number, and the maximum PNL reductions occur near the peak noise angles between\n120 and 140 degrees. Figure 67 shows the freejet Mach number effect on the corresponding\nSPL spectra. The freejet appears to reduce the baseline nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s jet noise over the entire\nfrequency range of the jet noise spectra.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n27\n\n5.2\n\nRESULTS FOR SELECTED MODEL 3 MIXER DEVICES\n5.2.1\n\nEPNL versus Mixed Jet Mach Number Correlations\n\nFigures 68 through 78 show comparisons of the 1500-ft level flyover EPNL (freejet Mach\nnumber of 0.28) versus mixed jet Mach number correlations for most of the model 3 baseline\nand mixer devices tested, (i.e. 3C12B, 3C8B, 3IB, 3AB, 3DiB, 3DxB, 3BT48, 3BT24, 3BCv,\n3BC, 3BOmax, 3T24B, 3T48B, 3HmB, 3FmB, 3IC, 3C12C, 3C8C, 3AC, 3T24T24, 3T24C,\n3T48T48, 3T48C, 3HmC, 3HmS, and 3HmOmax). The most effective noise reduction\ndevices are the primary Chevrons with fan baseline nozzle (3IB, 3AB) or with fan Chevron\nnozzle (3IC. 3AC), and the primary flipper-tabbed nozzles with fan baseline nozzle (3T24B,\n3T48B) or with fan Chevron and 48-flipper-tabbed fan nozzles (3T24T48, 3T24C, 3T48T48,\n3T48C). The vortex generators doublets configured nozzle (3DiB, 3DxB), the scarfed fan\nnozzle (3BS), the offset centerline fan nozzle (3BOmax), the half- and full-mixer core\nnozzles (3HmB, 3FmB) did not achieve any significant noise reduction. In general, the\nresults show that the chevrons and flipper-tabbed devices worked best when installed on the\nprimary/core nozzle. The same configured devices installed on the fan nozzle did not work as\nwell.\n5.2.2\n\nEPNL Reductions/Suppressions Achieved by Model 3 Mixer\nDevices\n\nFigures 79 through 89 present the respective EPNL reductions achieved by the model 3\nmixer devices at freejet Mach number of 0.28. The plots show the delta EPNdB values on the\nY-axes as positive values for EPNL noise reductions and negative values for actual noise\nincreases. The figures show that some devices such as the 24 flipper-tabbed fan nozzle, the\nscarfed fan nozzle, the offset fan nozzle, actually increase the overall EPNL noise levels.\nDevices like the vortex-generators doublets produced no significant EPNdB noise effect,\nwhile the half- and full-mixer core nozzles produced negative effects at low mixed jet\nvelocity settings but positive effects at the higher mixed jet velocities. The devices that\nworked well are the primary chevrons and primary flipper-tabbed nozzles tested in\ncombination with the baseline fan nozzle or the chevron fan nozzle. These noise\nreductions/suppressions generally increase with increasing mixed jet velocity with maximum\nreductions as much as 3 EPNdB were achieved at the highest mixed jet velocity tested (1200\nft/sec). Devices that achieved the 3 EPNdB noise goal at 1200 ft/sec (Vmix) are (i) 3IC, (ii)\n3AC, (iii) 3T24C, (iv) 3T48C. Devices that nearly achieved the 3 EPNdB goal are 3T24B,\n3IB, 3AB, 3T48T48, 3T48B and 3C8C.\n5.2.3\n\nEffect of Freejet Mach Number on Model 3 Mixer Devices\nEPNL Reductions/Suppressions\n\nFigures 90 through 96 are plots of the EPNdB suppressions of the Model 3 mixer devices at\nthe second highest mixed jet velocity tested (Vmix=1155 ft/sec) for three freejet Mach\nnumbers, 0.0, 0.20 and 0.28. The results showed that there is no consistent trend of the effect\nof freejet Mach number on the mixer devices EPNdB noise suppression. For some devices\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n28\n\n(3AB, 3BT24, 3HmC, 3BOmax, 3HmB, 3FmB, 3AC, 3T24T24, 3T24T48, 3T24C, 3HmS,\n3T48T48, 3HmOmax and 3BS) the EPNdB suppressions decrease with increasing freejet\nMach number, while other devices (3C12B, 3C8B, 3IB, 3T48B, 3IC, 3C8C and 3BT48) the\nEPNdB suppressions remain constant with freejet Mach numbers.\n5.2.4\n\nEffect of Freejet Mach Number on Mixer Devices\xe2\x80\x99 PNL\nDirectivities\n\nFigures 97 through 100 show the effects of the freejet Mach numbers on selected mixer\ndevices\xe2\x80\x99 1500-ft level flight PNL directivities for mixed jet velocity setting of 1155 ft/sec.\nThe reduction of PNL with increasing freejet Mach number is not constant over the entire\nangle range and instead is more at the peak noise angle than at the either ends of the inlet and\naft angle directivities. The resulting impact is that the overall PNL directivity is flatter as\nfreejet Mach Mach number is increased, and it appears that the \xe2\x80\x9c-10 PNdB\xe2\x80\x9d down points are\nbeyond the angle ranges of the acoustic data (i.e. less than 50 degrees inlet and greater than\n160 degrees aft). In the term of the EPNL metrics, the mixer devices tend to have favorable\nlower peak PNLs but higher adverse duration correction factors relative to that of the\nbaseline nozzle. The net impact is that the overall EPNL reduction is somewhat lower than\nthe reduction of the peak PNL.\n5.2.5\n\nSPL Spectral Characteristics of Selected Mixer Devices\n(P&W\xe2\x80\x99s 48-Flipper Tabbed Primary and Fan Nozzles)\n\nThe noise characteristics for the 48-flipper tabbed primary and fan nozzles designed by P&W\nwere selected for more detailed acoustic analyses in this section. The 48-flipper tabs designs\nwere tested as (a) 48-tabbed primary nozzle with baseline fan nozzle (3T48B), (b) baseline\nprimary nozzle with 48-tabbed fan nozzle (3BT48), (c) 48-tabbed primary with 48-tabbed fan\nnozzle (3T48T48) and (d) 48-tabbed primary with GE\xe2\x80\x99s 24-Chevrons fan nozzle (3T48C).\n5.2.5.1 Comparison of PNL Directivities at typical \xe2\x80\x9cCutback\xe2\x80\x9d\nMixed Velocity Setting (Vmix=980 ft/sec, Freejet\nMach=0.28)\nFigure 101 shows a comparison of the PNL directivities of the 3T48B, 3BT48, 3T48T48 and\n3T48C test configurations versus that of the model 3 baseline configuration (3BB). As shown\nearlier in Figure 85, there is little or no EPNdB reductions for these devices at this low mixed\nvelocity setting. The 3T48B (48-tabbed primary nozzle) shows some noise reductions in the\naft angles but nothing in the inlet angles. The 3BT48 (48-tabbed fan nozzle) shows an overall\nnoise increase for almost the entire angle range. The combined 48-tabbed primary and fan\nnozzle (3T48T48) shows some noise reduction in the aft angles and a noise increase in the\ninlet angles, as one would expect to find when the noise effects of the 48-tabbed primary\nalone and the 48-tabbed fan alone are combined. The 3T48C (48-tabbed primary with GE\xe2\x80\x99s\n24-chevrons fan nozzle) shows the same trend as that of the 3T48T48, except that the noise\nincrease in the inlet angles are slightly less.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n29\n\n5.2.5.2 Comparisons of SPL Spectral Characteristics at typical\n\xe2\x80\x9cCutback\xe2\x80\x9d Mixed Velocity Setting (Vmix=980 ft/sec,\nFreejet Mach=0.28)\nFigure 102 compares the SPL spectra at four (4) far-field angles, 60, 90, 110 and 150\ndegrees. At this low mixed velocity, the 3T48B nozzle achieved about 2 dB low-frequency\nnoise reduction but generated slightly higher high-frequency noise at 90 degrees. In contrast,\nthe 3BT48 nozzle, shown in Figure 103, significantly reduced higher low-frequency noise\nbut also generated significantly higher high-frequency noise. In NOY weighting, the\nincreased level of the high-frequency noise has an adverse impact on the PNL metric, and the\nnet result is an overall PNL increase for the 3BT48 nozzle as shown in Figure 101(b). In\nFigure 104, the 48-tabbed primary and fan combination nozzle (3T48T48) also generated\nsignificantly higher high-frequency noise which is characteristic of the 48-tabbed fan nozzle.\nFigure 105 shows the SPL spectral characteristics of the combination nozzle 3T48C where\nthe 48-tabbed fan nozzle is replaced by the 24-chevrons fan nozzle. This nozzle has lower\nhigh-frequency noise levels, indicating that chevrons are better than tabs for the fan nozzle\napplication.\n5.2.5.3 Comparison of PNL Directivities at typical \xe2\x80\x9cSideline\xe2\x80\x9d\nMixed Velocity Setting (Vmix=1155 ft/sec, Freejet\nMach=0.28)\nFigure 106 shows a comparison of the PNL directivities of the 3T48B, 3BT48, 3T48T48 and\n3T48C versus that of the model 3 baseline 3BB for the typical higher \xe2\x80\x9csideline\xe2\x80\x9d mixed jet\nvelocity setting. The trends are similar as to those noted for the \xe2\x80\x9ccutback\xe2\x80\x9d jet velocity cases.\nMost of the PNL reductions are in the aft angles. There are no reductions and even some\nslight noise increases in the inlet angles.\n5.2.5.4 Comparisons of SPL Spectral Characteristics at typical\n\xe2\x80\x9cSideline\xe2\x80\x9dMixed Velocity Setting (Vmix=1155 ft/sec,\nFreejet Mach=0.28)\nFigures 107 through 110 show the SPL spectral comparisons of the 3T48B, 3BT4B,\n3T48T48 and 3T48C for the higher \xe2\x80\x9csideline\xe2\x80\x9d mixed jet velocity setting of 1155 ft/sec.\nThe comparisons again show the same trends, that (1) the 48-tabbed primary nozzle achieves\n2-3 dB low-frequency noise reduction with only a slight increase of high-frequency noise.\nand (2) the 48-tabbed fan nozzle achieves 2-3 dB low-frequency noise reduction but\ngenerates an equal amount increase of high-frequency noise.\n5.2.5.5 Effect of Freejet Mach Number on SPL Spectra\nThe effects of freejet Mach number on SPL spectra of the 48-tabbed primary nozzle\n(3T48B), the 48-tabbed fan nozzle (3BT48) and the 48-tabbed primary and fan combination\nnozzle (3T48T48) are shown in Figures 111, 112 and 113, respectively. The two 48-tabbed\nfan nozzle configurations all show that in the inlet angles (60 and 90 degrees) the reduction\nof noise levels due to increasing freejet Mach numbers are uneven across the frequency\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n30\n\nspectra. The high-frequency portions of the spectra (2000 Hz and above) indicate less\nreduction and are less sensitive to increasing freejet Mach number from 0.20 to 0.28.\nAccording to the prediction of the Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s JEN6 jet noise model for the baseline nozzle\npresented in Figure 1, these high-frequency noise are from the secondary or fan jet. One\nexplanation for the lack of reduction in high-frequency noise is that the tabs in the fan nozzle\nare interacting with the freejet tunnel flow and are generating additional high-frequency noise\nwhich negate any \xe2\x80\x9cflight effect\xe2\x80\x9d benefits the fan jet may encounter.\nFigures 114, 115 and 116 are cross-plots of the same SPL spectra for the three 48-tabbed\nprimary, fan and combined nozzles to show how the SPL spectra change with the three\nnozzles over freejet Mach number of 0.0, 0.20 and 0.28. The changes in SPL spectra are\nfound to be identical in all three freejet Mach numbers. The tabbed fan nozzle produce\nadditional high-frequency noise when tested by itself or in combination with the tabbed\nprimary nozzle. The suppression characteristics of the combined tabbed nozzle appear to be\nthe additive sum of the individual suppression characteristics of the 48-tabbed primary nozzle\nand the 48-tabbed fan nozzle.\n5.2.6\n\nComparisons of SPL Spectral Characteristics of Other Mixer\nDevices\n\nComparisons of SPL spectral characteristics of the other model 3 mixer devices tested are\npresented in Appendix A, Figures A-1 through A-80. Analyses of all these figures support\nthe general conclusion that chevrons and tabs installed on the primary nozzle are the best\nnoise suppression devices. These primary nozzle devices achieve low-frequency noise\nsuppression without generating additional increase in high-frequency noise. The same\nchevrons and tabs on the fan nozzle are not effective because they generate additional\nincrease in high-frequency noise either by interaction with the fan jet or the freejet flows.\n5.3\n\nSELECTED MICROPHONE PHASED-ARRAY TESTING\nRESULTS\n\nThe data was processed for each configuration and supplied to NASA LeRC in the form of\ncolor postscript files and plotable data files. These data were loaded onto a computer at\nNASA LeRC with the help of Dr. James Bridges for distribution to the AST partners. A\nsmall amount of analysis of the data was performed by Boeing for selected configurations\nand will be discussed below.\nFigure 117 shows a typical output for a configuration /test condition for one array. The\nconfiguration name and array identification are in each subtitle. Below this, the run\nidentification number, operating point, and Mach number are displayed. Each figure displays\nsix individual contours that show the relative SPLs from the peak source level. The third\noctave band center frequency (fc), the peak SPL, and the location (x and y) of the peak SPL\nfor each one-third octave band frequency are shown below each color contour.\nThe location \xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d on the streamwise axis is always referenced to the upstream freejet tunnel\nnozzle exit plane which is 30 inches upstream of the primary nozzle exit plane in the model 3\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n31\n\nbaseline nozzle. Therefore, when the value of the peak SPL \xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d location is given as x = 90\nmeans that the peak SPL source is actually located at (x = 90-30 =60) inches downstream of\nprimary nozzle exit plane. Since the cold diameter of the primary nozzle is 5.156 inches, the\n\xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d location normalized by the primary nozzle diameter is 60/5.156 = 11.6 primary nozzle\ndiameters. The \xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x80\x9d location for the peak SPL for each frequency band is referenced to the\nnozzle\xe2\x80\x99s centerline. Therefore when the value of the \xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x80\x9d location is given as y = -2 inches\nmeans the y-coordinate of the peak SPL is 2 inches above the jet centerline as seen by the\narray looking up. Y-coordinate equals 0 inches is approximately the jet centerline or axis.\nAn outline of the top half of the nozzle is shown in each contour as provided by Dr. James\nBridges. The nozzle is always on the left hand side of the contour with the jet flow from the\nleft to the right.\nTo the left of the figure, a color map shows the SPL relative to the peak levels. The peak\nlevel is shown as 0 dB while the rest of the SPL color contours as -2, -4 , -6 and -8 dB\nreferenced to the peak SPL value printed below each of the six blocks. SPL levels are only\nshown to -8 dB relative to the peak because levels much below these are subject to spatial\naliasing from the array. Spatial aliasing occurs in phased array beamforming analogous to\nfrequency aliasing in time-domain, signal processing. These arrays have about 8-10 dB of\nresolution between the main lobe and the highest side lobes. Therefore, signals below 8-10\ndB could be aliased signals from other sources, so they may not be true sources and are not\nshown. References 9 and 10 explain sidelobe levels and aliasing in greater detail.\n5.3.1\n\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A\n\nFigure 117 shows Model 3, the BPR 5 external plug, SPL source levels for operating point 21\n(sideline condition) at a tunnel Mach number of 0.28 for the large, 2-D array (array A) at the\n90 degree position. Notice at the lowest model scale frequency, fc=1000 Hz, there seems to\nbe one source (11.6 primary nozzle diameter) downstream of the nozzle while at the highest\nfrequency shown, fc=3150 Hz, there are two sources (one approximately one primary nozzle\ndiameter and a second one 11.4 primary nozzle diameter downstream). The downstream\nsource changes location very slightly forward (closer to the nozzle) as frequency is increased.\nThe upstream source becomes increasingly important as the frequency increases. The\nupstream source is not even visible at the lowest frequency, but is very evident at the highest\nfrequency.\n5.3.2\n\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array B\n\nFigure 118 shows the same configuration viewed with Array B (at higher frequencies).\nArray B is the name given to the high frequency, 2-D inner small-arm array at the 90 degree\nposition. This array works well from 8 to 40 kHz. Using the B array showed only one high\nfrequency source near the nozzle. The location of this source moves slightly forward with\nfrequency until it appears to be located at the secondary nozzle/ambient shear layer location.\nGenerally, these results can be explained by considering the two source regions separately.\nThe upstream source region near the nozzle exit, for herein named Region 1, results primarily\nfrom secondary/ambient mixing layer noise, any nozzle trailing edge, and duct noise. This\nsource region tends to dominate at the higher frequencies.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n32\n\nThe downstream source, conveniently named Region 2 for this document, is most likely the\n\xe2\x80\x9cclassical jet noise\xe2\x80\x9d region where jet mixing which give rise to the \xe2\x80\x9cmixed\xe2\x80\x9d jet is responsible\nfor the noise. This region dominates the lower frequencies in Figure 117, but is not apparent\nat frequencies above 10 kHz model scale in Figure 118.\nClearly the data show two separate source regions. Also, the location of the peak SPL for the\ntwo source regions does not move as drastically as has been suggested by some of the jet\nnoise prediction theories. The sources move slightly forward (toward the nozzle) with\nincreased frequency, but not continuously from Region 2 to Region 1. Instead each source\nregion seems to move only slightly while the relative importance changes with frequency. A\nlow resolution method (for instance one where the phase difference between two\nmicrophones is used to determine a source location) would show a continuous transition from\nthe Region 1 to Region 2 as the frequency increased because only the center of the mass of\nthe noise could be located. As frequency increases, clearly the center of mass moves forward\nin a gradual way. This may help explain some of the older data sets showing a smooth\ntransition of the peak SPL region towards the nozzle exit with increasing frequency.\n5.3.3\n\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A Point 23\n\nFigure 119 shows the baseline, external plug configuration at the cutback condition (Pt 23).\nComparing figure 119 with figure 117, it is clear that the relative importance of the two\nsources has changed. The upstream source, Region 1, has a higher relative SPL compared to\nthe downstream source, Region 2, as the operating condition is lowered (lower nozzle\noperating point).\nThis observation seems to suggest that the upstream source is less affected by the nozzle\nMach number than the downstream source.\n5.3.4\n\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array A Mach 0.0\n\nFigure 120 shows the baseline, external plug configuration at a tunnel Mach number of 0.0\n(static) instead of 0.28. Note the relative level of the two source regions. The downstream\nsource, Region 2, is more important relative to Region 1 for the static condition. This also\ntends to suggest that Region 2 is more affected by relative Mach number of the nozzle than\nRegion 1.\n5.3.5\n\nModel 3IC Viewed with Array A\n\nEnhanced mixing devices generally decreased the noise in the downstream noise region, but\nincreased the noise at the upstream region. The devices that were effective in reducing the\noverall PNLT noise, were the ones that reduced the downstream region without overly\nincreasing the upstream region.\nFigure 121 shows phased array data for Array A for the chevron nozzle noise suppression\ndevice. This far-field data showed that this particular noise suppression hardware gave low\nfrequency suppression with little increase in the high frequencies. Compared to the baseline\nconfiguration, Figure 117, this configuration has reduced levels for the downstream region,\nRegion 2, with minimally increased levels for the upstream region.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n33\n\n5.3.6\n\nModel 3BB Viewed with Array D\n\nThe 2-D arrays were moved to a downstream location of approximately 120 degrees to image\nthe jet noise sources at an angle more consistent with the peak radiation angle of a jet. Figure\n122 shows the phased array output for the baseline, extended plug configuration at the 120\ndegree position.\nNote the downstream source region has increased SPLs relative to the upstream source\nregion. The SPLs as given with the phased array are normalized to give the values as\nmeasured at the array. Since the downstream source is closer to the array than the upstream\nsource, an amplification of the SPL occurs as the 20*log10 of the ratio of the two distances.\nAlso, this D-array give higher peak SPL levels compared to the A-array for the same\nfrequency band. This observation could be explained by considering the classical case where\nthe jet flow in the form of jet \xe2\x80\x9ceddies \xe2\x80\x9c are convected downstream along a path within the\nshear layer which is at an angle 60 degrees to the D-array. The amplitudes of the noise\narriving at the D-array are amplified by a factor of 40 log (1-McCos60) where Mc is the eddy\nconvective Mach number.\n5.3.7 Selected integrated SPL Spectra\nIn addition to the contour plots, integrated spectra were obtained by assuming the sources at\ndifferent grid points outside the array resolution were incoherent (statistically independent\nand their powers can be summed). The time-averaged cross-spectral matrices were used for\nbeamforming and do not allow the correlation between sources at different locations to be\ndetermined.\nFigure 123 shows the integrated (bold lines) with the array at the 90 degree position versus\nthe far-field measured data at 90, 100, and 110 degrees. The levels are shown over a range of\nfar-field levels because the phased array itself spans a range of angles. All the data were\nextrapolated to 1 foot distance at full-scale frequencies. The phased array data did not\ninclude any atmospheric absorption and therefore the levels fall off at the highest\nfrequencies.\nThe data for this configuration look exceptionally good and suggest that further work should\nbe done to determine how well phased array measurements can reproduce far-field SPL\nspectral data. Figure 124 shows the integrated levels compared to the far-field data for the\n3IC configuration. This comparison shows significantly increased levels from 600 to 2000\nHertz full-scale for the integrated spectra. Further work is needed to explain why the\nintegrated levels differed from the far-field levels in this area.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n34\n\n5.4\n\nSELECTED PLUME SURVEY PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE\nPROFILES\n\nPost-processing of the plume survey data and creating pressures, temperatures and jet\nvelocity contours in the form of color image postscript files were done by Dr. James Bridges\nof NASA Lewis. Selected results are shown in Figures 125a through 132c for eight nozzle\ntest configurations, 3T48B, 3T24T48, 3T24T24, 3T24C, 3BT24, 3FmB and 3HmB and\n3BOmax, respectively. In Figure 125b for test configuration 3T48B, the temperature profile\nof the 48-flipper tabbed primary nozzle with the baseline fan nozzle is a 12-lobe pattern with\na high degree of lobe penetration. This lobe pattern indicates that the \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d tab acts like the\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrest\xe2\x80\x9d of the lobe in the conventional mixer where the primary flow is forced outward into\nthe fan flow. The \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d tab behaves like the \xe2\x80\x9ctrough\xe2\x80\x9d of the lobe where the fan flow is\nforced inward into the primary flow. The \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d tabs separating the up and down tabs\nprevents the outward and inward flows from interfering with each other. In the 48-flipper\ntabbed primary nozzle case, there are 12 \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d tabs and 12 \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d tabs, and therefore, the\nresulting plume behaves like a 12-lobed pattern. Each \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d delta tab produces a pair of\nstreamwise vortices that rotates in opposite direction. Looking into the up tab, the vortex\nshed by the right edge of the delta triangular shape, the direction of the vortex is counterclockwise and the primary flow is pulled outward into the fan flow. On the left edge, the\nvortex flow direction is clockwise, and again the primary flow is pulled outward into the fan\nflow. The strength of this pair of vortices is approximately equal to the circulation which is\ngiven in Reference 11 as\nCirculation = 2 U H tan (alpha)\nwhere U is the velocity difference between the primary and fan flow, H is the tab height,\nand (alpha) is the tab angle relative to the primary nozzle mean flow line. The (alpha) value\nin the 48-tabs design is 30 degrees and value of tan(30) is 0.557. The value of H is ( 3.142\nx primary nozzle diameter / 4 x total number of tabs) which is equal to 0.085 inches. At the\nsideline condition, U is equal to (1585 - 1070 = 515 ft/sec.) Thus the computed circulation\nstrength is 4.06 sq. ft/sec. At the apex of the 90 degrees delta tab, the net circulation is zero,\nsince the pair of clockwise and counter-clockwise vortices have to cancel each other. For this\nreason, the delta tab is designed to have a sharp point at the apex. The circulation produced\nby the down tab has the same strength as the up tab. In general, the requirement for a good\ntab design is to have a small tab height (H) and a large tab turning angle (alpha). However,\nincreasing the value of alpha beyond 30 degrees could lead to local flow separation which is\ndetrimental to the performance of the nozzle in flow and thrust coefficients.\nThe 24-flipper tabbed primary nozzle test configuration has twice the tab height as the 48tabbed configuration and hence twice the vortices strength. The plume data for this\nconfiguration is shown in Figures 126a to 126c. The plume temperature profile shows a 6lobe pattern with twice the lobe penetration as the 48- tabs. The primary flow no longer has a\nhot potential core and instead it is divided into six (6) smaller jets which mix rapidly with the\nfan flow to form a uniform mixed jet at only a few diameters downstream.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n35\n\nThe 48-tabbed and 24-tabbed primary nozzle configurations have some of the best noise\nsuppression characteristics and have achieved close to 3 EPNdB. On the recommendation\nfrom P&W, NASA Lewis has selected both 48- and 24-tabbed primary nozzles for additional\naero-performance testing at Aero System Engineering to quantify the flow and thrust\ncoefficients for these type of tabbed nozzle designs.\n5.5\n\nASSESSMENT OF EPNL BENEFITS OF APPLYING SELECTED\n\xe2\x80\x9cBEST\xe2\x80\x9d MIXER DEVICES TO P&W\xe2\x80\x99s ENGINE PRODUCTS.\n\nOn the request from NASA Lewis, P&W made some preliminary estimates of the EPNL\nbenefits of applying the noise suppression characteristics of the most promising mixer\ndevices to the PW4084/98 jet engine product which has a scale factor of 12. The methods\nused to obtain these preliminary delta EPNdB are described in the following section.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cPfiles\xe2\x80\x9d SPL spectra (from NASA Lewis for scale factor of 8) were rescaled to a factor\nof 12, by applying a frequency shift [to lower frequencies by a factor of 10 Log (12/8)], and\nadjusting the amplitude higher by 20 Log (12/8). This adjustment was applied to the baseline\n(3BB) as well as the selected mixer nozzles. The resized SPL jet noise spectra for each\nnozzle configuration were then projected to a 1500-ft altitude level flyover prediction\ntogether with other engine noise components (i.e. fan, turbine, compressor, core/combustion)\nto get an effective total airplane flyover noise EPNL calculated value. These calculations\nwere done for the typical sideline and cutback conditions, corresponding to 1155 ft/sec and\n982 ft/sec Vmix. The calculated total airplane EPNL value using the baseline (3BB) jet noise\nbecomes the referenced base value from which the EPNdB suppression of the mixer devices\nare calculated. The results are shown below.\nNozzle\nConfiguration\n3BB\n3IB\n3AB\n3AC\n3IC\n3T24B\n3T48B\n3T48C\n\nEPNdB Suppression at Sideline\nJet Alone Total Engine Noise\nBase\n2.0\n1.6\n2.5\n2.7\n2.2\n1.6\n2.5\n\nBase\n1.0\n0.5\n0.9\n1.3\n1.3\n1.0\n1.3\n\nEPNdB Suppression at Cutback\nJet Alone Total Engine Noise\nBase\n0.6\n0.0\n0.8\n0.8\n0.0\n0.8\n0.8\n\nBase\n0.2\n-0.3\n0.0\n0.3\n0.0\n0.1\n0.3\n\nAs the numbers indicated, at sideline condition the mixer devices\xe2\x80\x99 EPNL suppressions are\nsomewhat reduced when applied to an actual engine product whose total engine noise\nsignature consists of more than jet noise. At cutback condition, the mixer devices\xe2\x80\x99 jet alone\nnoise suppression effectiveness are significantly reduced, and when other engine noise\ncomponent source levels are added to the total engine noise signature, the net effective total\nengine noise suppressions become even less.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n36\n\n6.0\n\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nScaled model suppression devices, nine (9) from P&W and ten (10) other model nozzle\ndevices from the General Electric Aircraft Engine Company (GEAE) (provided under a\nseparate NASA/GEAE contract), were tested in the NASA Lewis Nozzle Acoustic Test Rig\n(NATR) under static and simulated flight takeoff conditions. Far-field acoustic data, phasedarray microphone data and plume survey data were taken and the results analyzed.\nThe NASA\xe2\x80\x99s NATR noise results indicated that (1) inward-facing chevrons on primary\nnozzles and flipper-tabs on primary nozzles achieved the best Effective Perceived Noise\nLevel (EPNL) suppressions close to the SFN program goal of 3 EPNdB (at mixed jet velocity\ncondition of 1200 ft/sec). Adding fan chevrons to the above primary nozzle devices provided\nonly some additional marginal EPNL benefit. The results also indicated that primary nozzle\ndevices affected the low-frequency component of the baseline nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s far-field Sound\nPressure Noise (SPL) spectra. The fan nozzle devices affected the high-frequency component\nof the baseline nozzle\xe2\x80\x99s SPL spectra and in almost all cases, the fan devices actually\nincreased the levels of these high-frequency noise. Other test nozzle devices (vortex\ngenerators doublets (GEAE), scarfed fan, offset-centerline fan nozzle, min-lobed mixers,\ntongue mixer (Allison), neutral chevrons (GEAE), and combination nozzle consisting of two\nof these concepts) did not achieve the desired 3 EPNdB goal.\nThe Boeing\xe2\x80\x99s phased-array results showed that phased-array technology could be used\nsuccessfully to provide images of the jet noise sources of the separate-flow nozzle without\nintrusion into the jet exhaust plume. The phased-array tests showed that at low to mid\nfrequencies, there were two distinct jet noise sources. The first source is located near the\nnozzle exit and the second source is downstream at several nozzle diameters. The tests also\nshowed that the primary and fan mixer nozzle devices generally increased the upstream and\ndecreased the downstream jet source regions sound intensities. The best noise suppression\ndevices are the primary inward-facing chevrons and flipper-tabbed nozzles, which tended to\ndecrease the downstream source region with only minimum increase in the upstream source\nregion.\nThe NASA Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s plume survey data showed the primary tabbed nozzles produced pressure\nand temperature profiles that were similar to those produced by high-penetration lobed\nmixers. The profile is a 6-lobe pattern for the 24-flipper tabbed and a 12-lobe pattern for the\n48-flipper tabbed primary nozzle. In P&W\xe2\x80\x99s tab design which incorporated a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d tab\nseparating an \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9c down\xe2\x80\x9d tab, the neutral tab increased the effective lobe penetration\nand did not added to the effective \xe2\x80\x9clobe\xe2\x80\x9d count of the device. In the 24-tab case, the effective\nlobe count of the plume profile is controlled by the six \xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x80\x9d and six \xe2\x80\x9cdown\xe2\x80\x9d tabs. In GEAE\xe2\x80\x99s\ninward-facing chevron design, the effective lobe count of the plume profile is the same as the\ntotal number of chevrons.\nIn summary, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s model-scale nozzle noise tests show that it is possible to achieve a 3\nEPNdB jet noise reduction with inward-facing chevrons and flipper-tabs installed on the\nprimary nozzle. These chevrons and tabs are simple devices and are easy to be incorporated\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n37\n\ninto existing short duct separate-flow non-mixed nozzle exhaust systems. However, these\ndevices had been known to cause some small amount of thrust loss relative to the\naxisymmetric baseline nozzle system. Thus, it is important to have these devices further\ntested in a calibrated nozzle performance test facility to quantify the thrust performances of\nthese devices. The choice of chevrons or tabs for use in the SFN jet noise reduction would\nmost likely be based on the outcome of these devices thrust loss performance test results.\n7.0\n\nNEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nAs mentioned in the Summary of Section 1.0, a number of jet noise reduction concepts have\nbeen developed and demonstrated in model tests during the current contract efforts at Pratt &\nWhitney and GEAE. It is anticipated that the most promising of these concepts will be\nvalidated in full scale engine tests at both Pratt & Whitney and Allied-Signal, under funding\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Engine Validation of Noise Reduction Concepts (EVNRC) programs. This\nwill bring the technology readiness level to the point where these jet noise suppression\nconcepts could be incorporated with high confidence into either new or existing turbofan\nengines having short-duct, separate-flow nacelles.\nA patent application has been filed by Pratt & Whitney (inventors: John K. C. Low and\nDouglas C. Mathews) for the alternating tab, or \xe2\x80\x9cflipper tab\xe2\x80\x9d concept. This device is unique\nin that it involves a repeating cycle of tabs in a pattern of up-neutral-down-neutral. This\npattern, when repeated 12 times (48 tabs) or 6 times (24 tabs) resulted in nearly 2.5 EPNdB\njet noise suppression, with relatively low flow blockage.\n\nNASA/CR\xe2\x80\x942000-210040\n\n38\n\n8.0\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s model-scale nozzle noise tests show that it is possible to achieve a 3 EPNdB jet noise reduction with inwardfacing chevrons and flipper-tabs installed on the primary nozzle and fan nozzle chevrons. These chevrons and tabs are\nsimple devices and are easy to be incorporated into existing short duct separate-flow nonmixed nozzle exhaust systems.\nHowever, these devices are expected to cause some small amount of thrust loss relative to the axisymmetric baseline\nnozzle system. Thus, it is important to have these devices further tested in a calibrated nozzle performance test facility to\nquantify the thrust performances of these devices. The choice of chevrons or tabs for jet noise suppression would most\nlikely be based on the results of thrust loss performance tests to be conducted by Aero System Engineering (ASE) Inc. It is\nanticipated that the most promising concepts identified from this program will be validated in full scale engine tests at\nboth Pratt & Whitney and Allied-Signal, under funding from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Engine Validation of Noise Reduction Concepts\n(EVNRC) programs. This will bring the technology readiness level to the point where the jet noise suppression concepts\ncould be incorporated with high confidence into either new or existing turbofan engines having short-duct, separate-flow\nnacelles.\n14.
