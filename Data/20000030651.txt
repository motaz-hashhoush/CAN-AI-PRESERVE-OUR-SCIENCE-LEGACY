The client and\nserver nodes consist of a TCP/IP over ATM\nconfiguration.\nThe ATM cells from the client or\nthe server are transmitted\nto a gateway, packaged\nwith some header information,\nand lransferred\nto\na commercial\nLEO satellite constellation.\nThese\ncells are then routed through the constellation\nto\na gateway\non the\nglobe\nthat\nallows\nthe\nclient/server communication\nto take place. UBR\n(unspecified\nbit rate) is specified as the quality of\nservice (QoS). Various data rates are considered.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe motivation for this research arises from the\ndesire to maintain continuous\nTCP connections\nbetween the NASA terrestrial base, which is the\nclient, and the server on a NASA LEO satellite,\nregardless\nof its position over the globe.\nTwo\npossible\nresolutions\nto the problem\nof global\ncoverage\ncan be considered.\nThe first is the\nutilization\nof a number of GEt\nsatellites.\nThe\npower requirements\nand launch technology\nof\nGEt satellites causes them to be very expensive.\nAlso, the delay involved\nin communicating\nacross GEt hops is a concern.\nA second, and more recent, alternative is the use\nof an intermediate\nLEO constellation\nto provide\nglobal coverage.\nLEO satellites do not have the\npower requirements\nof GEts,\nand recent launch\ntechnologies\nhave\nallowed\nLEts\nto\nbe\npositioned at a relatively low cost.

The client at the NASA base in Houston,\nTexas and the server on a NASA LEO satellite\norbiting\nthe Earth, in the same orbit as the\nSpartan\n1, communicate\nusing\nthe satellite\nconstellation\n[1]. The performance\nof TCP/IP\nover ATM between the client and the server are\npresented.\nAlthough\ncurrent\nLEO\nsatellite\nconstellations\nare primarily\nintended\nfor voice\ncommunications\nand have a low data rate, our\nintention is to examine them as potential means\nfor providing TCP/IP over ATM communication\nbetween\nLEO mission satellites\nand terrestrial\nlocations.\nSATELLITE\n\nThe constellation\n\nNETWORK\n\nconsists\n\nof 66 LEO\n\nsatellites.\n\nThese\nLEts\nare capable\nof inter-satellite\ncommunication,\nas well as uplink and downlink\nability.\nThe frequency used for uplinks is 29.2\nGHz and for downlinks\nit is 19.5 GHz.\nThe\nsatellites communicate\nwith each other at 23.28\nGHz. For all communications,\nquaxternary phase\nshift keying (QPSK) is used as the modulation\nscheme. The satellites are in 6 orbits with 11\nsatellites in each orbit.\nThe LEO constellation\nuses 12 gateways positioned globally, according\nto the current\nIridium\nground\nfacilities\n[2].\n\nThis report is a preprint of an article submitted to a journal for\npublication.\nBecause of changes that may be made before formal\npublication,\nthis preprint is made available with the understanding\nthat it will not be cited or reproduced without the permission of the\nauthor.\n\n-_,,T_:.:\'.\'-,_\n\n_,.=:.._\'_:..._._:_\'::::.....,#_...:,g_._._,,._.._,,,_.._x:\n\n_...._......._<_\n\n...... :_:-\'_-----,_rl,\'C_-q\'_V\'_.-\xc3\xb7--.../\':_,\nJ\n\n......\n\n...... .......\n:_\n__.._.-.-;_\n\n......\n\n....\n:._._....... ..o.._......._.....,(_._. ......_-xToo._....._...._ _: .... _. ......\n_\n.\n.......\n_\n.---_--_ ...... -_J_ -_.--._...... _._\'__-_.Jl_-_--\xe2\x80\xa2 ._.\n._\n_\n_\n\n..................\n\n_,_r-....._k_<\n._\n,\n\n......... ,...... _\n_._._._\n\n..... -._ ....... _.._.._-.- o><....._....-._r.......\'l_-_\n.......... .=_....\n, _\n, ><\n:__,\n, ._-_.Li_.__._\n.\n\n-_.__\n\n_-\n\n-._..-._ :........\': ....................... ........................\n........\n..\n_\ni\n"\n_\n_................ ........................:................ .......\xc3\xb7\ni\n_\n_\ni\n:\ni\n+\n................ ........................ ................\n!\n_\ni\n_\n"\ni\n\n.......\nFigure\nFor the purposes of this simulation,\nthe ground\nstations serve as bridges to and from the LEO\nconstellation.\nThe ground station located near\nPhoenix,\nArizona\nis connected\nto the NASA\nJohnson Space Center in Houston.\nThe overall\nnetwork is shown in Figure\n1.\nThe smaller\ncircular\nnodes represent\nthe constellation\nof\nLEOs.
