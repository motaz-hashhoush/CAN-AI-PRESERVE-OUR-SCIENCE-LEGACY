The piston is connected to a shaft\nand produces work as it moves outward and inward. A\ndisplacer plate moves between an absorber plate and a\ncooling plate to form an air space between the displacer\nand one or the other of these two plates for heating and\ncooling the fluid. The displacer plate is moved from one\nplate to the other by the displacer push ring as the piston nears the midpoint of its travel on the outward\nstroke and again on the inward stroke.\n\n1 Claims, 5 Drawing Figures\n1\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nApr. 27, 1982\n\n4,326,38 1\n\nSheet 1 of 2\n/\n\nA\n\n.18\n\n54\n\n24\n60\n\n/\n\n36\n\nFIG. 1\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nApr. 27,1982\n\nSheet 2 of 2\n\n48\n\nFIG. 2\n62\n\nFIG.3\n\nFIG. 4\n\nn\n\nFIG.5\n\n4,326,38 1\n\n1\n\n4,326,381\n\nSOLAR ENGINE\nORIGIN O F THE INVENTION\nThe invention described herein was made by an employee of the United States Government and may be\nmanufactured and used by or for the Government for\ngovernmental purposes without the payment of any\nroyalties thereon or therefor.\n\n2\n\npocket between the displacer and the absorber plate.\nThe cycle is then ready to begin again.

Displacer support 42 is attached to 5\nthe displacer 48 high on the side of displacer 48 and\npoint 54, so that once displacer 48 is moved past the\nvertical by displacer push ring 30 or displacer push ring\n32, gravity will force displacer 48 against absorber plate\n16 or cooling plate 18.\n10\nPower cylinder 26 penetrates absorber plate 16 and is\napproximately perpendicular to absorber plate 16.\nPower cylinder 26 is located approximately two-thirds\nof the way up on the absorber plate 16 and lies on a\ncommon axis with power rod slide cylinder 36 which is 15\nsimilarly mounted on cooling plate 18.\nPiston 28 is mounted in power cylinder 26. A seal is\nmaintained between power cylinder 26 and piston 28 by\nseal 56. A power rod 40 connects piston 28 and a power\nrod positioner 34 located in power rod slide cylinder 36. 20\nThe power rod positioner 34 maintains power rod 40\naligned with the centerline of power cylinder 26 and\npower rod slide cylinder 36. A displacer push ring 30 is\nfixed on the power rod 40 on the absorber side of displacer 48 and a displacer push ring 32 is fixed on the 25\npower rod 40 on the cooling side of displacer 48. The\npower rod 40 is not connected to the displacer 48 and\npasses through displacer 48 at opening 60.\nFIG. 2 is a schematic view of solar engine 10, viewed\nfrom the rear, with the rear part of insulated case 44 30\nremoved. Displacer 48 is supported by displacer support 42 which is pivoted to displacer 48 and at point 54.\nDisplacer support 42 is attached to insulated case 44 by\ndisplacer support anchor 62. Since displacer 48 is wider\nat the base than at the top, and since the displacer sup- 35\nport 42 is attached high on the displacer 48 at point 54,\nafter displacer moves past the midpoint on each cycle,\ngravity will force the displacer 48 the rest of the way\nand hold it against absorber plate 16 or cooling plate 18.\nFIG. 3 is a schematic view of solar engine 10 during 40\na heating portion of the cycle. Absorber plate 16 and\ndisplacer hot side 20 are transferring heat to the air\nbetween displacer hot side 20 and absorber plate 16.\nThe air expands as it is heated creating pressure on the\ndisplacer side of piston 28 which is higher than the 45\natmospheric pressure on the other side of piston 28, thus\nforcing piston 28 in the direction of arrow 58. Displacer\ncool side 24 is resting against cooling plate 18 and cooling plate 18 is transferring heat from displacer cool side\n50\n24 into the shadow area 63.\nIn FIG. 4 piston 28 has moved to the outer limit of its\ntravel. Displacer push ring 32 has pulled the displacer\n48 against absorber plate 16. Heat is now transferred\nfrom the air in the space between cooling plate 18 and\ndisplacer cool side 24, to displacer cool side 24 and to 55\ncooling plate 18. The air begins to contract as it is\ncooled. Absorber plate 16 is heating displacer hot side\n20.\nIn FIG. 5 piston 28 is being drawn inward, as shown\nby arrow 60, as the air in solar engine 10 cools and 60\ncontracts, since atmospheric pressure on the outside of\npiston 28 is greater than pressure inside solar engine 10.\nDisplacer push ring 30 has made contact with displacer\n48 and has started to move displacer 48 in the direction\nof arrow 60. Displacer 48 is smaller than the insulated 65\ncase 44 so that there is no pressure rise as displacer 48 is\nshifted from the absorber plate 16 to cooling plate 18.\nAlso, holes 52, at points where plate spacers 38 pene-\n\n~\n\n4\n\ntrate displacer 48, allow passage of air as displacer 48\nmoves from one position to another.\nIt is thus seen that a solar engine according to the\npresent invention is of simple construction and will run\nat a lower temperature differential than most air engines.\nIt will be understood that the foregoing description is\nof the preferred embodiment of the invention and is\ntherefore merely representative. Obviously there are\nmany variations and modifications of the present invention in light of the above teachings that will be readily\napparent to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be\nunderstood that within the scope of the appended\nclaims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as\nspecifically described.\nWhat is claimed as new and desired to be secured by\nLetters Patent of the United States is:\n1.
