It is a significant research instrument for microelectronics research because it is able to image underlying layers or interfaces of surface structures. A tiny current is injected into a metal layer and the electrons travel ballistically through the metal allowing the researcher to study the operation and performance of a structure. Other advantages include nondestructive imaging of barrier heights and electronic characterization of devices, as well as the potential to observe processes like molecular beam epitaxy (crystal growth) in situ.", "title": "Analytical Instrument", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:02:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080278, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080278, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "e553864092684fb3969778c2175bc24f", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080278.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080278/downloads/20020080278.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080278/downloads/20020080278.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080278/downloads/20020080278.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
