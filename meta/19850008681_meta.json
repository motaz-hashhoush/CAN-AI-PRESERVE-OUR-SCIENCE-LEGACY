Vehicle requirements as well as technology needs and need dates were established and technology programs initiated to support those potential developments in a timely manner. It is assumed that advanced OTV will be space based and fully reusable for low cost operations, use aeroassist for return to low-Earth-orbit, and evolve to a man-rated system. The propulsion system will need to maintain high performance over a wide thrust range for mission flexibility, ranging from the transfer of large, acceleration limited structures from LEO to GEO, to demanding high reliability round-trip manned missions. Technology advances are needed in propulsion, aerobraking, low-gravity cryogenic fluid management, and in environmentally compatible, low-loss cryogenic tankage. In addition, diagnostic instrumentation for monitoring the health of on-board components and systems, and automated check-out capability will enhance low-cost space based OTV operations.", "title": "NASA OAST perspective", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T13:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850008681, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stephenson, F."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "0b95a6fc09f44cdcb6691ce10274c08b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850008681, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850008681, "id": "4326a0c0673a44e885ade4997ed2c479", "publicationName": "NASA.
