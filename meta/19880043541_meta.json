An evaluation was made of the requirement for the coupling of pilot and copilot sidestick controllers, as well as for the coupling of the aircraft autopilot to the sidestick. Tests were conducted on sidestick characteristics and control modes, anternative configurations for sidestick coupling, and alternative configurations for autopilot coupling. Design recommendations are made on the basis of the results obtained.", "title": "Fly-by-wire sidestick controller evaluation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:11:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880043541, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Summers, L.
