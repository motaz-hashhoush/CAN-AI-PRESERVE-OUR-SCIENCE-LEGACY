The apparatus includes a pair of curved extraction grids (16, 18) with multiple pairs of aligned holes positioned to direct a group of beamlets (20) along converging paths. The extraction grids are closely spaced and maintained at a moderate potential to efficiently extract beamlets of ions and allow them to combine into a single beam (14). An accelerator electrode device (22) downstream from the extraction grids, is at a much lower potential than the grids to accelerate the combined beam.", "title": "Ion beam accelerator system", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080004729, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aston, Graeme"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "a88f0e3fc6e248be91bf252931198a8a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080004729, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080004729, "id": "e6c863e0ca1849e0a0ac6bf52848ca50", "publicationDate": "1984-05-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080004729.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080004729/downloads/20080004729.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080004729/downloads/20080004729.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080004729/downloads/20080004729.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
