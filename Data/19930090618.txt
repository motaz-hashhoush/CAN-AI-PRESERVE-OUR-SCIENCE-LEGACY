("Socit\nProvencale de Constructions Ae\'ronautiques), is a three-engire\nseaplane complying with the specifications for commercial seaplanes and the first seaplane satis f ying the conditions for\nthe seaworthiness certificate of the first class. It is a biplane with wings of unequal span and a central hull. It is\nequipped with three Hispano-Suiza engines of 180 HP. each,\ntransversally arranged between the wings. This arrangement of\nt.he engine mountings eliminates all vibrations at the normal\nrevQlutlOn speeds of the engines. The hull is divided into\nwater-tight compartments, two of which may be fitted for carrying passengers, light freight, packages and mail.\nThe "Meteore 63" is built especially for long-distance\ntraffic. It is equited with radio receiving and broadcasting\napparatus for use both during flight and on the water; fire\nextinguishers, and dual \' control. Electric light and heat for\nthe \'oassengers are supplied by a generator. Portholes provide\ngood visibility and illumination by day. The cabins are\nequipped with comfortable chairs designed to receive the shoulder parachutes.\nOne of the principal advantages of this seaplane is its\nability to fly with one of the engines stopped, which enables\n*Fro a circular published \'by the S.P.C.A. with supplementary\ndata from "Les Ailes," July 29, 1926.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 41 \t\n\n2\n\nit to return to its starting point orcontinue to its .destination. This characteristic, combined with its large strong\nhull suitable for alighting on the high seas, gives this seaplane the maximum of safety. Its normal cruising speed is\n140 i (87 miles) per hour with full load. It can carry sufficient fuel for a flight of 7 hours at the normal power of\nthe engines.\nIn the 1926 commercial-seaplane contest, organized by the\nDepartment of Aeronautics and the Aero Club of France, the\nIt Meteore 63" passed all the tests, including four consecutive\nflights of 561 n (349 miles) each, without alighting, nor\nfailure, nor repairs. These tests made under full load, demonstrated the perfect flight regularity of the "Meteore 63," its\nquick take-off, its rapid climb to 2000 m (16562 ft.), its small\nlanding speed, its maneuverability in the air and on the water,\nand its mooring facilities. The "Meteore 63" was awarded the\nfirst prize.\nThe "Meteore 63" is now making practical test flights on\nthe non-stop Marseilles- A lgiers line with a view to the establishment of a regular line between France and Northern Africa.\nOn one flight it. made a record of 4 hr. 8 mm. These flights,\nsome of which were made under very unfavorable atmospheric\nconditions, confirm the value of the "Meteore 63," which is the\nfirst long-distance seaplane acquired by the French Government.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircra:N Circular No. 41\t\n\n3\n\nThe seaclane 1 Meteore 631 is the first croduct of the\n\'1Socje\'te\' Provencale cle Constructions A\xc3\xa9ronautiques. \t\n\nThis com-\n\npany has workshops at Narseilles and Ciotat. It must not be\nconfused with the "Chantiers de Provence_Aviation , u which also\nbuilds seap lanes and is situated in the same region.\nCell.- It is a biplane with non-staggered wings and a wide\ngap (3.2 m = 10.5 ft.). The upper wing is horizontal and of\nmedium thickness, with a span of 21.2 m (69.55 ft.), and a\nchord of 3.1 m (10.17 ft.). The two ailerons are attached to\nthe upper wing. They are very long and narrow and are well\nbalanced. The lower wings are very different from the upper.\nThey have a slight dihedral, a span of 18.2 m (59.7 ft.) and a\nchord of 2.7 m (8.86 ft.). Their tips are tapered and rounded.\nThere is a single pair of struts for each half-cell, with\nsteel brace-wires. The lower wings are imbedded in the hull\nand the central part of the upper wing is joined to them by\nthe structure which supports the three engines. The wing structure is wood and is covered with fabric. A perfectly streamlined float is suspended under each lateral pair of struts.\nul1.- This is also made of wood. It hs three coverings\none of teak, one of cedar and the third of birch plywood. Its\ntot.al length is 12 in (39.37 ft..) and its maximum width is 2.2 in\n(7.22 ft.). It has only one step. In front there is a cockp it with two seats abreast, one for the pilot and one for the\n\nN.A.C..A. Aircraft Circular No. 41 \t\n\n4\n\nmechanic or navigator. From this cockpit a door opens into\nthe passenger cabin and, from the latter, another door affords\naccess to a \'oazgage room with a capacity of 2.35 i \t\n\n(25.3 sq.ft.).\n\nfl . - The vertical empennage consists of a large fin, coninuous with the hull, and a. balanced rudder. The horizontal\nempennage consists of a rectangular stabilizer and a balanced\nelevator in two parts. The under side of the stabilizer is\nbraced against the hull by two small oblique struts. On the\nupper side, it is attached to the fin by two cables.\nPower_Plant.- The three engine-propeller groups are installed in front with their propellers practically plumb with\nthe leading edge of the cell ar\xc2\xb1d the axis of traction at the\nmiddle of the gap. Each engine nacelle is equipped with a\nHisp ano-Suiza engine of 180 }., driving a two-blade tractor\npropeller of wood. The three engine nacelles are supported\nand bound to the cell by a system of triangulated struts. The\nengines are cooled by means of frontal radiators above and behind each engine nacelle.\nThe electric current, required on board and particularly\nfor supplying the radio station, is furnished by two alternatore mounted on the leading edge of the upper wings.\n\n\t\n\nN.A.C.A.
