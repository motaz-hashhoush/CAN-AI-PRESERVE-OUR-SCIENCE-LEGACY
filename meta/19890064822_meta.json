After a brief consideration of simple physical conditions for the defense, a calculation of an equation for the number of satellites needed for the defense is made along with some typical values of this for possible future conditions for the defense. Basic energy and power requirements for the defense are determined. A sumary is made of probable minimum conditions that must be achieved for laser power, targeting accuracy, number of satellites, and total sources for power needed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "56", "submissionId": 19890064822, "issn": "0002-9505", "id": "9dbe527535394f86a2836ec66cdb42f9", "publicationName": "American Journal of Physics", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
