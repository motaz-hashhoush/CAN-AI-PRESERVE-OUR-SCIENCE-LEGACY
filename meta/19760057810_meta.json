The maps of scale 1:24,000 that are available in the imaged area permitted the study of the geometric errors of the radar mosaics and of individual radar strips. An estimate was obtained for the effect of the distribution and density of ground control points and for the accuracy of different mosaicking methods that are currently employed with synthetic aperture radar images. It is shown that a successful radar mosaicking process requires the elimination of image errors of up to several kilometers. These errors are introduced as a result of the limited precision of the inertial aircraft navigation. An example of a radar mapping effort in which the navigation errors could be eliminated is presented. The resulting radar mosaics have residual RMS mapping errors of planimetry of about plus or minus 150 m.", "title": "Side-looking radar mosaicking experiment", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T15:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760057810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Leberl, F."}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena", "location": "Calif., United States"}}, "id": "a23f03abaf7a493c859a240dbb4b3671"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19760057810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jensen, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "e65e164aa9e04a0ab5b9feac5b6b8a96"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19760057810, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kaplan, J."}, "organization": {"name": "Aero Service", "location": "Philadelphia, Pa., United States"}}, "id": "c5158a82e50244648ec18d95e81b09da"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19760057810, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760057810, "id": "0ddf26fe547540c193ab67e223891880", "publicationDate": "1976-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
