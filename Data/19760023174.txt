INTRODUCTION\nThe STS User Study includes:\n1.\n\nThe STS User Plan (User Data Requirements) Study\n\n2.\n\nThe Ancillary Equipment Study.\n\nNASA needed to find out which STS user required data are not\nbeing furnished and have them described. In addition, the NASA\nHeadquarters Office of Space Flight (OSF) Missions and Payloads\nOffice is interested in working toward a document constructed to fit the\nneeds of potential STS users (I. e. , users working in the study phases\nof payload and space systems).\nFor the STS User Plan Study, over 100 STS and payload documents\nwere surveyed to .find which user data are missing. The user data required\nfor each phase of the user activity are formalized in a matrix, related to\nthe documented data, and the missing users\' data are identified. If\nfurther Investigation shows no plan or provision for acquiring and documenting it, the missing data are defined and described in a statement in\nResearch Technology Operating Plan (RTOP) format. The study results\ntherefore mesh with the RTOP system and are directly useful to NASA.\nNASA is considering definition and development of Multi-Mission\nSupport Equipment (MMSE). NASA needs to understand which support\nequipments under consideration are potentially useful for DoD STS payloads.\nIn the Ancillary Equipment Study the ancillary equipment needs for DoD\npayloads were examined. Many of the NASA MMSE correspond to the\ntypes of equipment needed by DoD. Fifteen on-line MMSE are potentially\napplicable to one or more of the DoD payloads in the near term.\n\n1-1\n\n1\t\n\n^\t\n\n!\n\n1\n\n2.\t\n\nSTUDY OBJECTIVES\n\nThe objectives of the STS User Plan (User Data Requirements)\nStudy are to:\n\n1,\t\n\nPrepare rn overall estimate of data and planning requirements needed by the STS user\n\n2.\n\nDetermine where the NASA and USAF studies related\nto STS users fit into the estimated Matrix of planning\nrequirements\n\n3.\n\nProvide NASA with the contractors\' estimates of additional\nuser required data not currently covered by study activity\nwhich, if carried out, would satisfy the requirements\nof the Matrix and planning requirements.\n\nThe objective of the STS Ancillary Equipment Study was to\ndescribe, from NASA\'s point of view, the potential for common usage\nof Multi-Mission Support Equipment (MMSE) by DoD in addition to NASA\nusers.\n\nt iGINAI; PAG19 "IS\n\nI)OR QUALITZ\t\n\n2-1\n1\n\n\t\n\nb, a\t\n\n3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER STUDIES\n\nIn Study 2. 2, the STS user analysis made use of a long list\nof NASA and DoD study reports, as well as documentation for NASA\nand DoD payload projects a nu NASA and Rockwell International documentation on the STS. For a complete list of studies used, please refer to\nSections 9. l and 9. U of Volumes II and III, respectively, of this report.\nThe STS User Plan (User Data Requirements) Study is related\nto the SAMSO-sponsored STS Users\' Guide activity. Wherever possible,\n\nthe same Aerospace Corporation personnel supported both these activities.\nThus, when documentated data was reviewed for application to one activity,\nlittle additional effort was required to assess the applicability of the same\ninformation to the other study.\nThe Ancillary Equipment Study is primarily related to the MultiMission Support Equipment (MMSE) Study accomplished by the Martin\nMarietta Corporation, Denver Division. This FY 75 study was sponsored\nby NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and NASA Kennedy Spacecraft\nCenter. Other primary references for the Ancillary Equipment Study\nare the DoD STS Payload Interface Study accomplished in fiscal years\n1973, 1974, and 1975 by McDonnell Douglas, and Rockwell International\nPayload Interface Studies carried out in FY 75. These latter studies\nwere sponsored by the USAF Space and Missile Systems Organization\n(SAMSO).\n\n.\t\n\n,siGINA1G i\'tiG^ TS\n\ni\n\n.\nr; 11?00p QU\t\n\na\ni\n\n3-1\t\n\n}\ni2\n\nP\n\n:t. STS USER PLAN STUDY\n\n-1. 1 METHOD OI\' APPROACIf AND PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS\nWhen the STS User Plan Study was planned and initiated in the\nSeptember 1974 time period, SAMSO/Aerospace had a large STS data\nbank, consisting of NASA, DoD, and contractor documents related to\nOw various elements of the Space Transportation System and its potential\npayloads. The Aerospace Corporation\'s Advanced Mission Analysis\nnirectorate also had acquired data on many NASA payload projects over\nthe previous three or four years for use on NASA studies, Early in the\nstudy, an activity was initiated for the purpose of surveying the data\navailable and acquiring data not already in house but needed for these\nstudies. This study shared in the NASA studies data bank effort in order\nto acquire NASA and DoD historical payload data needed but not available\nat Aerospace. Other primary users of these data were Studies 2.3 and\na.4 (Ref. 1).\nOn the basis of the information in the payload data banks, a list\nof STS user data requirements is made. The requirements irrlude\ndata shown to be needed by payload project phase for past or current\npayload projects. STS payload study data was also used to determine\npayload data requirements. In addition, several brainstorming meetings\nwere held for the purpose of generating user data requirements which\nmight not be evident from the documentation.\nThe user data requirements list was related through a matrix\nformat to a typical payload project activity by program phase. The full\nmatrix listing the user data requirements is 39 pages and is presented\n,\n\nin Volume II. A sample page is shown in Table 4-1. The data requirements are listed in the left-hand column and payload program phases\n\n4-1\nORIGINAL\' PAGB I,g \t\nOP P\nOOR QTJ\nALITI\n\n1\n\ni\t\n\nI\t\n\ni\n\noUc^\n\nL\n\n,^\n\nro ^ c\nO ro v\n\nA\'\n\nH\t\n\nE\n\n^:\n\nro or,\n\nw\nv^\t\n\nI\t\n\no0 8\n\n^\'^.^a\n0\n\nI\t\n\n\t\n\n^\n\nO\n\ny\n\n^\'\na\n\na\t\n0\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n00\n\n^\n\n^\n\'d\n\n:\xe2\x80\xa2 \t\n\now\no ^ c\nID\n\n^\n\n^ ro\n\n3\n^n\nF-\n\nH\n\no\n\no\n\nv\n\nU\n:,\n\n^^)UC^\n\nN\t\nr^ ^\nv, qa oo M\n\n(LI\n\nro\t\n\n0O o\n\ny\n\nO<J O\n\nge\nv\n\n^\'\nM N\n\nUU O\n..\n\na\n\n\'\n\na\n\nto\n\nO Oa\n\nLJ\n\nOV V\n\nv\n\nOT.Q\n\nr^\n\n^T\n\nell\n\nwA\n>^\n\nri\n\nO^\n\n10\nv\n\n_\n\nO61,\ntia^\n\n^ p,\n\n^\nW v\n\nOL\n\nrorI\ntti\n\n4Vi\n\nG\n\nU\n\na\n\n\' n\n\n\xe2\x96\xba,\t o\nw V\n\no\nro\n0 \'C\n\nw\n0\n\n0\t\n\nro\n\np,\n\no\nCr\n\nC\n\nQ+\n\n(\t\n\n.^\nu\n\n\xe2\x96\xba.\n~\n\nCL\ntv\n\nC\n\nU\n,^ ^;\nti^\n\na\'\n\nro o\n\nbx\ncL a\n\nv\n\n:s o U V\n\nwZ\n\nw\nv\n\nv\n\n;^\n\n.^ Hr u\n\n^ ^\n\n.di\n\nro ^\n\n4-2\n\nu\t\n\n0\n\nro\n\n^ V)\n,^\n\nAa\n\nro. i v\n\nO\n\nv\n\nu\t\n\nr w\nro\n\n:, CL\n\n.^, y\na\n4\nw a W\nv\n\no\n\ne\t\n\ni\n^\t\n\n6\t\n\n,ire listed across flit, top of the page. Pre-Phase A and Phase A are\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nconceptual HLudy phaseH; while. \'Chase B is a system definition phase,\nThe rerna:ning Development and Operational Phases are self-explanatory.\nThese phases represent typical stops which a user\'s payload project may\ngo through (Rof. L). The notation "f" in a column denotes that that particular\nphase is the first one of the sequence where the data is needed. Where\na (D appears in a column, the data is required in order to carry out a\nnormal study in that phase of payload activity. Where a U appears, it\ndenotes that it is desirable to have the information or data available for\nthat phase of the study, but the study could normally be carried out\nusing assumed or estimated data. These user data requirements were\nreviewed in house, with NASA Headquarters, and with representatives\nfrom KSC, MSFC, and JSC.\nThe next task in the STS User. Plan Study was to read through\ndocuments which could contain STS user data. The information in each\nof the documents is summarized ,nd related to the matrix when appropriate.\nA sample of a Document Summary Sheet is shown in Table 4-2. Tho key\nfor this reference if F-I. Wherever it is applicable to the data requirements, the key F-1 appears in the matrix.. For instance, the data are\napplicable to seven of the data requirements in Phase A shown in Table\n4-3. This table repeats the \'if", Q , and 9 information and lists by\nkey each of the references with data applicable to each of the user data\nrequirements. If evidence is found in a document that data will be made\navailable in the future, it is noted in parentheses after that key, e. g. ,\nEP-15 1, 1 75) indicates that document FP-15 plans to make the data available\nto the user and the estimate is by the end of 1975. Data for items 7 a\nand c to support Phase B are provided in detail commensurate with the\ndevelopment phase requirements. Thus the data are available to cover\nthese areas, although the user would have to select and filter the data\nto obtain data appropriate for Phase B activity.\n\n11\n\n4-3\n\n+\n\n~!\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\n~~\n\nC :a\n""l ....\n\nI\n\n.:.\n\n...\n\nGCf!t""ral d("sc:rlptlOn OJ\nalnlili"s, de\\\xc2\xb7elu\\JOler.t\nd suppo rl 5\\\xc2\xb751"m5.\n\nC OVERAGE OR CO:>:Tl.:i:T:\n\n-:.\n\nned\nro-\n\nrrau\xc2\xb7,\xc2\xb7 \' \\ ,t.ern\n\n.,.\n\n~ . ~7\n\n\\.;\n\nAPPL.,CABLE TO OAT ,\\ R\n\n. .. ... .

The\ndata are missing from several areas because the STS definition was\ninadequate to support the user data requirements. Work on tiles(. areas\nis postponed until the data are expected to be ready. For other missing\ndata areas, study tasks were initiated in order to define the data, describe\nthe data, and justify the requirement for the data. Nine study tasks are\naccomplished. Where justified, statements of user data requirements\nare prepared for each area in RTOP format and transmitted to NASA.\nIt is assumed in this study that studies developing intcrfav(analysis techniques, plana for testing to obtain interf.- e tlat:t, and plan:=\nr, tau^trh data de\'icribed }Ii the documents as "Lo he doternutu c (I" or\n"T!\'!)" would he carried h i lt.

These loading conditions designed some elements of the payload\nstructure. The uncertainty in these loads at this stage of the orbiter\ndevelopment and the weight constraints on some payloads can result in\ncritical design problems late in the development program. Load alleviation devices can be added to the payload installation, dcaign, and testing\nprogram. The user needs data on STS dynamic load alleviation concepts\nwhich could be potentially applied to the interface between the payload\nand the orbiter.\nThe STS user has the option to use orbiter power, communications, cooling, and other services, as well as orbiter attachments,\nthe remote manipulator, and attitude and navigation handoff data. Each\nof the services is supplied through orbiter and orbiter/payload interface\nequipment. The user needs failure mode, effects, and frequency of\noccurrance data covering each of the equipments.\nDuring the study it was found that the acoustic environment\nto which the payload would be subjected at liftoff was being predicted on\nthe basis of analytical studies and model testing. The uncertainty in the\npredicted acoustic environment is relatively large and it was recommended\nthat a 3-sigma, worst-case type environment prediction be made for use\nby payloads interested in a low risk development program.\nIn the study it was found that some of the F\', \xc2\xbbloads would want\nto consider mounting the payload in the payload bay witSi five attach\npoints. In order to reduce the attach point loads to acceptable levels,\nthe fifth attach point requires that loads induced by the orbiter deflection\nbe added to the payload attachment loads. In order to accomplish this\nanalysis, the STS user will need orbiter payload bay deflection data.\n\n4-7\n\nf\t\n\nA Spacelab user will need interface data for both the pressurized\nmodule and the unpressurized pallet.\t Some of the data\nsupplied, but the following information is missing at this time:\n1.\n\nAdministrative (data related to scheduling, flight manifests,\nproprietary rights, user costs, and experiment/Spacelab\ninterface control)\n\n2.\n\nEquipment environments (contamination data)\n\n3.\n\nGround support facilities and services (ETR and WTR)\n\n4.\n\nSpacelab services, instruments, standard support\nequipments on data management, power supplies, pointing\nand navigation data, and crew support (including EVA)\n\n5.\n\nProvisions for experimenters onboard the STS\n\n6.\n\nSpacelab experimenter training and qualification\n\n7.\n\nPhysical constraints and mechanical interfaces\n\n8.\n\nPhysical characteristics of payloads permitted (c, g. ,\nweight and dimensions)\n\n9.\n\nIntegration procedures, requirements, and instructions\nfor Levels I, II, and III integration\n\n10.\n\nGround operations and flight operations.\n\nIn order to relate the user\'s payload design with STS performance,\na payload chargeable sequential weight statement will be required. The\nuser will also need to understand the weight margins available to him\nand Shuttle load factors. The derivation of these sequential weights is\na part of the user\'s mission analysis. It must be relatable to the STS\noperator\'s flight plan. In order to accomplish this, a set of standard\ndefinitions for payload chargeable weights; load factors; and weight,\npropellant, and payload c. g. margins need to be developed. An example\nanalysis is used to illustrate the problem.\n\n4-8\ni\n\nI\t\n\n\'\t\n\nIt was found during the study that certain data would not be\nSTS users scheduled for flight early in the Shuttle\nfinalized until needed\t\nera, ror instance, the dynamic loads to which a payload may be subjected\nare expected to be much better defined after the Shuttle flight test program.\nThe acoustic overpressure to which the payload is subjected will also\nbe much better understood after the flight test program. The need for\nthe data on load alleviation devices and worst-case acoustic environment\nresult from this gap in the user required data. Both these user data\nrequirements supply data enabling the payload designer and Shuttle user\nto work around the temporarily unavailable data.\nThe STS capability in several areas is currently being defined\nbut is in such a state of change or incomplete definition that the user data\nrequirements cannot be currently quantified. Among these are: (1)\nthe capability of the remote manipulator system expected to assist in\nthe deployment of payloads, (2) the procedures and sequence for docking\npayloads to the orbiter, (3) the potential electromagnetic interference\nbetween orbiter and payload due to orbiter radiation, and (4) the orbiter/\npayload avionics capability. It is recommended that these areas be\nmonitored in the future for STS user data requirements. It is recommended that the STS user data requirements in the avionics area be\nstudied in the next fiscal year. The avionics system definition is maturing\nthe\nrapidly.\n\ni\n\n4-9\n\nj\n\nr\n1\n\n5. ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT STUDY\n\n5.1\t\n\nMETHOD OF APPROACH AND PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS\nWhen the study was initiated, the on-line Multi-Mission\n\nSupport Equipment (MMSE) list contained 76 items and 56 additional\nitems were listed as launch site MMSE. In the "incillary Equipment\nStudy, 35 (1) airborne and 19 launch site equipment items, studied by\nMartin Marietta and accepted by NASA KSC or ! ISFC for further definition\nand study, were identified and listed as MMSE to be considered. Descriptions of most of the selected equipments are contained in the Martin\nMarietta catalogs for launch site and airborne (or on-line) MMSE (Refs.\n3 and 4). The catalogs, modifications in the catalog descriptions, and\ndescription of items not in the catalogs were furnished to this study by\nWilbur Thompson of NASA MSFC.\nRevision 4 of the DoD STS Mission Model was used in this\nstudy. It was found that the payload and interface data (Refs. 5 through\n10) are available in sufficient depth to identify airborne ancillary equipment needs for\n\nsix DoD payloads. Most of the launch site MMSE could\n\nbe studied for applicability without the detailed payload data required\nfor the airborne MMSE. The launch site MMSE application analysis\nwas not limited to the sixpayloads. DoD airborne ancillary equipment\nneeds are extracted from the information and data in References 5\nthrough 10. Payload data are also extracted from the same references\non the six payloads studied.\n\n(1)\t\n\nThirty-four automated spacecraft MMSE and one sortie MMSE.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n5-1\n\nThe DoD ancillary equipment needs were then compared to\nthe MMSE list to identify candidate MMSE for application to the DoD\nmission model. Thirty-one of the 35 items of airborne MMSE were\nidentified as candidates for DoD ancillary equipment. The application\nof each equipment to each of the DoD satellites was studied by specialists.\nThese equipment studies are discussed and the results are provided in\nVolume III of this final report.\nThis study was a first cut at identifying potential applications\nof MMSE. It is assumed that the study will continue in FY 76 so that\nwhen better definitions of payload/STS interfaces evolve, the potential\nutility of MMSE can be further assessed and compared with alternative\napproaches to support equipment.\n5.2\t\n\nBASIC DATA GENERATED AND SIGNIFICANT RESULTS\nIn the Ancillary Equipment Study the basic data generated are\n\nthe potential applications of MMSE defined for DoD payloads. These\nbasic data are presented on the Multi-Use Mission Support Equipment\nData Sheets contained in Section 5 of Volume III of this report. In the\nnear-term STS era, 15 on-line MMSE items were found to have one or\nmore potential users among the DoD payload projects. Thirteen launch\nsite MMSE items were found to have potential users in the DoD mission\nmodel. Several equipment items were recommended for addition to the\nNASA MMSE candidate list as another result of the Ancillary Equipment\nStudy.\nEight of the 15 MMSE items which would be used by DoD payload projects are associated with the IUS/payload structural interface.\n1.\t\n\nPayload Mounting Beam for Side-By-Side Payloads\n(XPMB-1)\n\n2 1\tPayload Mounting Beam for Single Payloads (XPMB-2)\n\n5-2\n\ni.\t\n\nPayload Interface Adapters Suitable for DoD Payloads\n(PIA-2 and PIA-3)\n\nh.\t\n\nPayload Spacer for Small Diameter Multiple Payloads\n(PLS-2)\n\nS.\t\n\nPayload S,pPa^cer for Medium Diameter Multiple Payloads\n(XPLS-3)ll)\n\n6.\n\nPayload Service Plates (PSP-1,-2)\n\n7.\n\nSeparation Latch and Push-Off Assembly (SLP-1)\n\nThe General Purpose Platform (GPP-2) could be used to\nmount any one of three DoD payloads piggyback in the orbiter bay over\nthe Spacelab tunnel.\n\nA payload shroud may be needed by at least one DoD payload\nand MMSE item 06-02 is large enough to accommodate the IUS payload\n(DSP). Li addition, the low earth altitude orbit payloads SOSS and DMSP\nmay need shrouds. Recommendations are made for NASA\'s consideration\nfor modification to accommodate these payloads.\nThe RTG Cooling Unit (06-01) satisfies DoD cooling capacity\nrequirements and could be a common MMSE item for DoD and NASA.\nThe Orbiter/Payload Servicing Cable (IUS Deployed) MMSE\nitem (05-03) is potentially useful to at least ten DoD payloads and some\nmultiple payloads on the IUS. The Payload Umbilical Cabling (05-04)\nwhich mates with the servicing cable could also be used. Another MMSE\nitem labeled Orbiter/Payload Service Cable and J-Box (05-01) would be\napplicable to multiple payload configurations in the payload bay if some\nweight reduction modifications to the approach could be incorporated.\n(1)\t\n\nXPLS-3 design diameter increased to accommodate DoD payloads\n(see Volume III, Section 5. Z, of this report).\n\n5-3\n\ni\n\nThe MMSE Purge System (06-03) could be used by the DoD\npayload DMSP to satisfy purging and cooling requirements.\nAlthough a justification task was not a part of this study, it\nis expected that DDT&E costs would be lowered for both DoD and NASA\nby sponsoring common interface equipments (MMSE). In addition, there\nare potential advantages for system operators. Orbiter turnaround costs\nand payload installation time could be saved by the use of common on-line\ninterface equipment. The use of a standard interface between the IUS\nand the NASA and DoD payloads would greatly facilitate the IUS operation\nwith multiple payloads on the IUS.\nMost of the DoD payloads for the early STS time frame will\nbe transitioning from expendable launch vehicles. These transitioning\npayloads are expected to have the option of using previously applied GSE\nor launch site MMSE. The applicability of the previously used GSE to\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nthe STS supported payloads needs to be studied. However, six launch\nsite MMSE items needed by DoD payloads are new to the STS and are\nrecommended for consideration by NASA as common NASA/DoD equipments.\nThese include payload containers, container transporters, and interface\nverification equipment.\n\n5-4\nI\na\n\n\t\n\n6.\t\n\n6. 1\t\n\nSTUDY LIMITATIONS\n\nSTS USER PLAN STUDY\nIt became apparent during the study that some STS elements\n\nwere dither in it state of being defined or the definitions were in a state\nof change. The user required data for the initial upper stage, avionics\ninterface, and remote manipulator system were not available since it\n\nIn obtain firm definitions of the interfaces, hollow-up\nstudy is recommended (see Section S).\n\nwas too early\n\n6.2\t\n\nANCILLARY EQUIPMENT STUDY\n\nThe emphasis in the Ancillary Equipment Study was on the\nuse of support equipment early in the Shuttle era; therefore, emphasis\nwas on the IUS-related equipment rather than Tug-related equipment.\nInitially Payload Specialist Station (PSS) and Mission Specialist\nStation (MSS) equipments were included in the study. It was found,\nhowever, that the scenario for use of these stations and their interface\nwith the payload was under study by NASA, DoD, and their contractors;\nthus subject to considerable change. Therefore, these areas were deleted\nfrom this study and recommended for further effort in the future.\nDuring this study, Aerospace was directed to apply MMSE\ndefined by NASA and their contractors and not to define additional equipment, even though it might be identified as needed by DoD.\nThe DoD STS/payload interface data used in these studies\nwere the best available (see Refs. 5 through 10). The interface\nstudies are continuing and the DoD needs for support equipment are\nSubject to change.\n\nOr p D QL^ ^\t\nt\n\n6-1\n\n7. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH\n\nAs these studies progressed, it was noted that there is a\ngreat deal of concern about the possibilities of airborne and surface\nparticles dirtying the payload while it is in the orbiter payload bay.\nPossible contanihiallun from the orbiter reaction control system and\norbiter vents, exhausts, and dump lines is also of concern. Research\nis needed on techniques for countering dirt and contamination on vital\npayload surfaces. The ability to clean payloads on orbit would be\nvery desirable. Removing particles orbiting in the vicinity of the payload may also be desirable. it is suggested that cryogenic "vacuum"\ntechniques, electrostatic techniques, and other approaches for accomplishing these types of cleaning be investigated with the objective of\nmvcntually developing payload cleaning tools (hand tools, RMS end\neffectors, etc.).\n\n7-1\n\nr\n_Y\n\n^\t\n\n1\t\n\nI\n\n8.

In addition, ii is recommended that the following\nareas be reviewed again since the study assumes that rapid progress\nwill be made in obtaining user required data: (1) remote manipulator\nsystem, (\'L) rendezvous and docking to the orbiter, (3) rkiectromagnetic\ncompatibility and Interface, (4) integrated payload/orbiter dynamic loads,\n(5) STS simulators for orbiter/payload interface, (6) Shuttle operational\ndata book, and (7) reentry and terminal flight phase constraints affecting\nreturn opportunities.\nIn the coming year, Martin Marietta is under contract to NASA\nto study MMSE in the following areas which may be applicable to DeD,\n(1) attitude refcrenca. sensor, (2) electrical cabling, (3) RTC cooling unit,\n( 41) payload shroud, (5) purge system, (6) IUS to payload interface structure,\n(7) orbiter to payload interface structure, and (8) deployment mechanisms.\nIn addition, McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell International\nare under contract to SAMSO to continue definition of STS/payload interface cquipmenL needs. It is recommended that the Ancillary Equipment\nStudy be continued in order to assess the applicability of the redefined\nMMSE to DoD and investigate potential advantages of common ancillary\nequipment between the two agencies.\n\n8-1.\n\n\t\n\nj\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\t\n\nSt\nape ll, The Aerospace corporation,\nPt.
