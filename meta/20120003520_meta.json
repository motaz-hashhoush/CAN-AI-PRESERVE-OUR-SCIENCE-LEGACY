These same qualities are as critical, if not more so, in the operation of spacecraft. A research, development, test, and evaluation process was put into effect to identify, understand, and interpret the engineering and human factors principles which govern the pilot-vehicle dynamic system as they pertain to space exploration missions and tasks. Toward this objective, piloted simulations were conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center and Ames Research Center for earth-orbit proximity operations and docking and lunar landing. These works provide broad guidelines for the design of spacecraft to exhibit excellent handling characteristics. In particular, this work demonstrates how handling qualities include much more than just stability and control characteristics of a spacecraft or aircraft. Handling qualities are affected by all aspects of the pilot-vehicle dynamic system, including the motion, visual and aural cues of the vehicle response as the pilot performs the required operation or task. A holistic approach to spacecraft design, including the use of manual control, automatic control, and pilot intervention/supervision is described. The handling qualities implications of design decisions are demonstrated using these pilot-in-the-loop evaluations of docking operations and lunar landings.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120003520, "endDate": "2012-03-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "6ed326cc98b74143a500367a98855d67", "id": "d5dc0f83599142b88cbb665690771a16"}], "name": "2012 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "6ed326cc98b74143a500367a98855d67", "startDate": "2012-03-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120003520, "id": "8f205c0ec5a5484a97ba7e94a8d534a6", "publicationDate": "2012-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120003520.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120003520/downloads/20120003520.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120003520/downloads/20120003520.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120003520/downloads/20120003520.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
