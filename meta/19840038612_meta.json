The amplifier provides 8.2 watts of power with 39 dB gain over a frequency band of 1.4 GHz. Nonlinearity analyses of solid-state amplifiers suggest that system performance can be improved significantly by using an FET amplifier. Preliminary investigations reveal that the solid-state amplifiers can be space-qualified and can be expected to replace the TWTA in many communication links in the near future. It is pointed out that with improvements in device technology, the power, bandwidth and efficiency of solid-state amplifiers using FETs can be further improved. With FETs operating at a junction temperature of less than 125 C, solid-state amplifiers are inherently reliable, indicating a ten-year mean time to failure.", "title": "K-band FET amplifier for satellite downlink", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840038612, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Goel, J."}, "organization": {"name": "TRW Electronic Systems Group", "location": "Redondo Beach, CA, United States"}}, "id": "513b64e6d06a4e79a9ab3ae85f25395b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19840038612, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cheung, R.
