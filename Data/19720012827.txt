Putre\nLewis Research Center\nSUMMARY\nThe use of an Earth-based high-power laser beam to provide energy for a rocket\nvehicle is investigated. The laser beam is absorbed within a rocket nozzle by an optically opaque propellant such as seeded hydrogen. The energy that is absorbed in the gas\nis converted to high-specific-impulse thrust by expanding the heated propellant through a\nnozzle. The specific impulse that yields the highest payload into Earth orbit per total\nenergy consumed lies in the range of 1200 to 2000 seconds. The payload fraction is in\nthe range of 0. 20 to 0.40 of the initial gross takeoff weight for a specific impulse of\n2000 seconds and for thrust-to-initial-weight ratios of about 1. 2 to 4. 0. Because the\npayload fraction is about an order of magnitude higher than that for conventional chemical rocket means for placing payload in orbit, the cost of the vehicle per pound of payload could be an order of magnitude lower. Large electric power stations are required.\nThis could be the most important cost factor unless the powerplant amortization is\nshared by using it for other purposes. The powerplant could be used, for example, for\nproducing hydrogen, oxygen, and electric power, for desalinization, for chemical processing, for waste disposal, for sewage treatment, etc. The propellant cost and the\nelectrical energy cost (at commercial rates) are a small fraction of the total launch\ncosts.\nA detailed cost and overall system analysis is beyond the scope of this report. The\nmainjnirpose of this report is to describe a technique that can be used to place payload\nin orbit by using high-power ground-based~iaserS"and-to-s-hGW-t-hat-a-possibLlity_exists\nthat the cost might be very low compared to those of other means. A further detailed\noverall system and operation study would be required to substantiate this possibility\nfully.\nINTRODUCTION\nAt the seventh annual meeting of the AIAA at Houston, Texas, Kantrowitz (ref. 1)\nstated that it seemed likely to him that lasers with powers of the order of thousands of\n\nmegawatts are an important possibility. He also observed that the energy change in\ntransferring a mass from the surface of the Earth to a low-altitude orbit around the\nEarth was about 3.56x10 joules per kilogram (4. 5 kW-hr/lb) and that the cost of this\nenergy is about $0.044 per kilogram ($0.02/lb). Potentially, therefore, it may be possible to place mass in orbit with energy costs of fractions of dollars per kilogram.\nThe purpose of this report is to explore a technique for using high-power lasers for\npropelling an Earth-launched vehicle that places payloads into orbit. In this technique,\nhigh-power Earth-based laser beams interact with vehicles so that they are propelled\nfrom the surface of the Earth. The high-intensity laser beam captured by a propellant\nproduces high enthalpy gases which are expelled to produce thrust. For example, the\nlaser beam could be absorbed by an optically opaque gas, such as seeded hydrogen. The\nhydrogen gas and seed particles are injected through porous walls of the nozzle, as\nshown in figure l(a). In another approach the laser beam impinges on an ablative plate\nat the base of the nozzle, and the high-intensity beam causes the plate to evaporate. The\nhot gas that is generated in the absorption or ablation process will expand away from the\nplate to produce thrust. A nozzle skirt could be placed around the outer perimeter of\nthis plate to better direct the expansion of the gases in the rearward direction and thereby greatly increase the efficiency of the energy conversion.\nThe use of the proposed laser propulsion technique may not be limited to placing\npayloads in orbit. The device might also be used to accelerate payloads on direct trajectories to any of the planets, asteroids, or comets or into orbit around the Sun. In\naddition, the laser propulsion system might also be used on Earth for transcontinential,\ntransoceanic, or world-wide transportation. In these applications it would be used to\nplace vehicles into free-flight ballistic trajectories. The vehicle would have the capability of maneuvering and landing at the destination site much as the return stage of the\nspace shuttle. The vehicle could also use a laser beam at the destination to provide\nbraking thrust to decelerate and land.\nThis report presents the results of simple calculations to indicate the potential of\nsuch a propulsion system. Calculations are made to determine payload fractions; power\nand energy requirements; the effect of specific impulse, initial acceleration, and laser\nefficiency; and the cost of electrical energy and propellant. An overall costeffectiveness study which includes such factors as vehicle structure cost, land-based\npowerplant and laser cost, and development cost is beyond the scope of this report.\n17\n\nSYMBOLS\nCN\n\nnozzle coefficient\n\nD\n\nlaser optics diameter, m\n\nE,\n\nlaser beam energy collected at engine, J\n\nE\n\nelectrical energy used to drive laser, J\n\ng\n\nlocal gravitational acceleration during flight, m/sec\n\ng\n\naverage gravitational acceleration during flight, m/sec\n\ngg\n\nEarth surface gravitational acceleration, 9.81 m/sec\n\nh\n\nenthalpy of heated propellant at inlet of nozzle, J/kg\n\nI\n\nspecific impulse, sec\n\nk\n\nthrust-to-initial-weight ratio\n\nm\n\nvehicle mass, kg\n\nm\n\npayload mass, kg\n\npay\n\nin\n\n2\n\n2\n\ninitial propellant mass, kg\n\nm\n\n2\n\ninitial vehicle mass, kg\n\ntot\n\ntg\n\nengine firing time\n\nAV\n\nvehicle velocity increment, including drag penalty, m/sec\n\na\n\npropellant mass fraction,\n\nn\n\noverall beam transmission efficiency\n\nX\n\nlight wavelength, m\n\nm\n\nD/\n\nm\n\nt0t\n\nhalf-angle of beam divergence, rad\n\nDESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED LASER PROPULSION SYSTEM\nA schematic drawing of the laser propulsion system proposed in this report is shown\nin figure l(a) and (b). The high-energy laser beam is directed toward a propellant injection plate located within a nozzle. The laser beam energy is absorbed by hydrogen*(or\nother gas that flows through the injection plate and walls of the nozzle) seeded with seed\nparticles such as carbon or natural uranium to render it opaque.\nThe propellant enthalpy and hence specific impulse are determined by dividing the\nbeam power by the rate of propellant flow. The lower the propellant flow rate or the\nhigher the beam power, the higher the enthalpy. The hot propellant and vaporized seed\nmixture is expanded to space. A nozzle skirt is provided to direct the expansion and\nthus provide a more efficient conversion of thermal power to thrust force. The nozzle\nskirt is protected from the high-temperature radiating and expanding gases by an opaque\nboundary-layer film along the surface. This film is provided by utilizing a porous and/or\n\na slotted wall that allows injection of a film with absorbing seed material entrained. The\nflow of propellant and seed vapor in the film will have the effect of reducing the specific\nimpulse. The technique of using seeded gas to absorb radiated thermal energy has been\nstudied in detail for gas-core nuclear rockets (ref. 2). Specific impulses of over 5000\nseconds appear to be feasible when this approach is used.\nIt is important that the laser beam be accurately and reliably pointed toward the\nnozzle. One way to accomplish this may be to have the beam direction slaved to signals\nfrom the laser-propelled vehicle (see fig. l(b)). For example, auxiliary laser beams\nthat are parallel to the main power laser beam could be used for this procedure. The\nauxiliary beams could be directed to guidance detectors that are located outside the\npropulsion system. If the auxiliary beam begins to drift off the center of the target of\nthe detector, signals are sent to the Earth-based high-power laser system that automatically corrects the pointing of the high-power and auxiliary beam. If the auxiliary beam\nwanders too far off the target of the detection system, the main laser beam can be reduced in power by some predetermined schedule so that no damage to the laser propulsion system or vehicle results.\n2\nThe intensity of the laser beam (kW/cm ) is determined by the desired propellant\ninjection enthalpy and flow rate per unit area. Beam intensities of the order of megawatts per square centimeter may be required. Such beam intensities are presently attainable in relatively small (less than 30-kW) gas lasers. Several or a large number of\nlaser beams could be used to transmit the necessary power to the propulsion system if\nsome limit in laser size were reached. Each laser could be individually directed or\nthey could be coupled. It may be advantageous to use many lasers to provide redundancy\nor permit operation with lower power lasers if the power level for a single laser becomes a limiting factor.\nIt will be necessary to use lasers in frequency ranges where windows exist in the\natmosphere of the Earth and to locate the laser bases at sites where beam attenuation or\nspreading by clouds, smog, or turbulence is minimized. This, of course, is to minimize\'the power loss in the laser beam. It is also desirable to use very efficient lasers\nto minimize the ground electrical power requirements. Atmospheric turbulence will\ntend to spread the laser beam. It would therefore be desirable to locate launch sites on\nmountain tops to minimize this effect.\nThe trajectories that are required to place the laser-propelled vehicles in orbit will\nprobably be different from conventional trajectories. It is required to have a direct line\nof sight during the entire propulsion period between the Earth-based laser system and\nthe accelerating vehicle. This may lead to optimum Earth orbits that are elliptical\nrather than circular.\nThe direction of the thrust vector produced by the laser propulsion system need not\nbe parallel to the incoming laser beam. The vehicle could be canted of the order of 45\xc2\xb0\n\nfrom the laser beam direction if desired, as shown in figure l(a). The only limitation is\nthat the laser beam be absorbed within the nozzle.\nPreliminary design studies indicate that the thrust-producing portion of the laser\npropulsion system would probably not be heavier or more complicated than conventional\nchemical rocket engines.\n\nANALYSIS\nThe propellant is assumed to absorb all the laser beam energy that arrives at the\nvehicle. Thus, the propellant enthalpy is\n. _ laser beam power\npropellant flow rate\n\n/->\n\nThe specific impulse is related to the enthalpy by the equation\nJ\n\nsp = ~ V^h"\ng\n\n(2)\n\no\n\nwhere an overall nozzle expansion coefficient CN = 0. 64 is used to account for the nonideal expansion energy losses due to viscous effects and nozzle wall heat transfer.

Then ratios of payload and propellant mass to takeoff mass are\ncomputed for a range of specific impulses. From these ratios the total energy and\npower required per unit of mass in orbit are calculated. This information then permits\ncalculation of the cost of electrical energy and propellant for placing mass in orbit. No\nattempt is made to determine vehicle structure or Earth-based powerplant costs.\n\nBeam Power Requirements\nCalculations were first made of the beam power required per unit propellant flow\nrate as a function of specific impulse by using equation (3) (see fig. 2). It was assumed\nthat 64 percent of the arriving laser beam power was converted to thrust. The power\nrequired to produce thrust varies as the square of the specific impulse. About 1. 20x10\nkilowatts per kilogram per second (5. 5x10 kW/(lb/sec)) is required for a specific impulse of 4000 seconds.\nFigure 3 shows the corresponding laser beam power per pound of thrust produced,\nas given by equation (4). The laser beam power per unit of thrust varies directly with\nspecific impulse. At a specific impulse of 4000 seconds the required laser beam power\nper unit of thrust is 30. 6 kilowatts per newton (135 kW/lb). Figures 2 and 3 do not depend on propellant properties, so they apply for any gaseous propellant. Different propellant properties would yield different propellant temperatures and different limiting\nspecific impulses depending on the radiating characteristics of the propellant.\n\nPayload Mass Ratios for Earth Orbit Mission\nThe propellant- to total-mass ratio was calculated from equation (7) for a mission\nthat is equivalent to placing payload in a low-altitude Earth orbit. It was assumed that a\nvelocity increment including drag losses of 9150 meters per second (30 000 ft/sec) and\nan average gravity force of 0. 8 g were representative for this mission. The propellantto total-mass ratio is plotted in figure 4 as a function of specific impulse and thrustweight\' ratio. For a specific impulse of 4000 seconds the propellant mass ratio varies\nfrom about 0. 39 to 0. 25 as thrust-weight ratio is varied from 1. 2 to 4.0. At 2000 seconds the propellant mass ratio varies from about 0.60 to 0.40 for the same range of\nthrust-weight ratios.\nFigure 5 shows the corresponding payload- to total-mass ratio from equation (8)\nwith the empty or hardware weight (total weight less payload and propellant) assumed\n(conservatively) to be 20 percent of the total weight. For a specific impulse of 4000 seconds the payload- to total-mass ratio varies from 0.41 to 0.55 as thrust-weight ratio\nvaries from 1. 2 to 4.0. At 2000 seconds the payload- to total-mass ratio varies from\nabout 0. 20 to 0.40 for the same range of thrust-weight ratio. Above 4000 seconds the\npayload fraction begins to level off with increasing specific impulse.\n\nElectrical Energy Requirements for Earth Orbit Mission\nFigure 6 presents the laser beam energy per unit payload mass placed into lowaltitude orbit as a function of specific impulse and thrust-weight ratio. It is interesting\nto note that a minimum in laser beam energy per payload mass occurs for specific impulses in the range of about 2000 to 1200 seconds as thrust-weight ratio varies from 1. 2\nto 4.0. respectively. The minimum value of laser beam energy varies from about\nO\nQ\n7x10; to about 3x10 joules per kilogram (90 to 40 kW-hr/lb) for the same variation in\nthrust-weight ratio.\nThe minimum in energy required to place a unit payload mass into orbit as a function of specific impulse can be explained as follows. For low specific impulse the payload fraction is small because the propellant mass required to place a given payload into\norbit is large. The initial vehicle weight then becomes large for a given payload, which\nthen requires an increasing amount of total energy to place the given payload into orbit.\nFor high specific impulse the propellant fraction becomes small and the total vehicle\nmass approaches a lower limiting value equal to the empty weight of the vehicle and the\npayload. In this case the energy required to accelerate the propellant to the high jet velocities corresponding to the high specific impulse becomes much greater than the energy required to accelerate the vehicle. Between the extremes of low and high specific\n8\n\nimpulse there is a best value which minimizes the total energy required to place a unit\nmass into orbit. The more ambitious the mission (the greater the velocity change required for the payload), the higher the specific impulse that minimizes the energy required to accelerate a given payload mass.\nIt is possible to determine the ground powerplant energy required to place payload\nmass into orbit if the overall efficiency of converting the ground-based power into power\nabsorbed by the engine is assumed. Figure 7 shows the ground-based electric energy\nrequired to place a unit of mass into Earth orbit for assumed values of overall beam\nefficiency of 10, 30, 50, and 100 percent.\nThe exact value of overall beam efficiency will depend on several loss mechanisms.\nFirst, production of a laser beam from electrical energy involves a laser efficiency.\nEfficiencies up to 47 percent have been obtained experimentally (ref. 4), and Herzberg\n(ref. 5) claims that efficiencies approaching 100 percent may be ideally possible (assuming isentropic flow in a closed-cycle gas dynamic laser). Second, there is beam attenuation due to atmospheric scattering and absorption. Clear air transmission studies\n(ref. 6) indicate that transmission efficiencies of 85 percent are possible through a clear\natmosphere. Third, there may be energy losses unless the laser beam diameter is less\nthan the engine capture diameter. For an orbital system this requires that the beam di\xe2\x80\x94fi\nvergence 9* /\xc2\xab be at most about 5x10" radians if the capture diameter is 10 meters\n(32. 8 ft) at a distance of 1000 kilometers (620 miles). In comparison, the recent Moon\nranging experiments c\n(ref. 7), which represent state-of-the-art collimation, obtained\nvalues of\n\xc2\xael/2\n2x10 , which would require a diameter of 4 meters (13 ft). With astronomical telescope mirrors the theoretical beam divergence A/D can be made as small\n_fj\nas 10 (5-m (200 in.) mirror operating at visible wavelengths). However, atmospheric\nturbulence tends to increase the divergence, and, for example, resulted in the larger\nvalue in the Moon ranging experiments. With additional research on methods for reducing turbulent divergence, it may be possible to attain lower divergence values.\n\xe2\x80\x94fi\nIn addition, precision laser beam pointing with a pointing accuracy of 10 radian\nwould be required to keep the beam centered. The beam pointing system could be patterned after several high-precision star tracking systems such as used in the existing\nOrbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) or the proposed Manned Orbiting Telescope\n(MOT). These designs could be adapted to accommodate the larger moments of inertia\nand driving torques that may be characteristic of the laser beam system. The OAO has\ndemonstrated a pointing accuracy of 5x10 radian, and the proposed accuracy of the\nMOT is 5x10-8 radian (see ref. 8). It thus appears that the required 10-6 -radian beam\npointing accuracy could be met by adapting state-of-the-art techniques. Further study\nis required to determine what pointing response rates are needed to follow in-flight disturbances adequately and to identify drive system requirements.\nThe preceding discussion indicates that the overall efficiency of converting groundbased electrical energy to heat energy on board the vehicle may be at least 10 percent\n_>7\n\n9\n\nand possibly better than 50 percent.\nFigure 7, which was calculated for a thrust-weight ratio of 1. 5, shows that the optimum specific impulse is about 1600 seconds. The optimum specific impulse is independent of the beam efficiency. For an overall efficiency of 10 percent the required electrin\ncal energy per unit of payload mass in orbit is 5. 5x10 joules per kilogram (700 kW-hr/\nIb). If the efficiency were 100 percent, 5. 5x10 joules per kilogram (70 kW-hr/lb) would\n7\nbe required to place payload in orbit. This is to be contrasted to the ideal of 3. 56x10\njoules iper kilogram (4. 5 kW-hr/lb) quoted by Kantrowitz (ref. 1).\nThe difference between the ideal energy requirement and the actual value depends on\nseveral\',factors. A typical case at a thrust-weight ratio of 1. 5 and specific impulse of\n1600 seconds illustrates these factors. With the assumed nozzle energy conversion coefficient of 0. 64, only 64 percent of the beam energy is converted into propellant kinetic\nenergy. Because of the difference between vehicle and jet velocity, only about 36 percent of the propellant jet kinetic energy is converted into vehicle energy. Of this, about\n30 percent is used for payload acceleration because the payload is about 20 percent of the\ntotal mass. Multiplying these factors gives a payload orbital energy that is 7 percent of\nthe beam energy. This accounts for the large difference between the laser beam energy\ncalculated in this report and the ideal payload energy given by Kantrowitz.\nThe required electrical power per unit of payload mass for the Earth orbital mission\nis calculated from equation (10) and is shown in figure 8. This can be used to determine\nthe required powerplant capacity for a given payload. For the thrust-weight ratio of 1. 5\nit is seen that the power is lowest near the optimum specific impulse of 1600 seconds.\nFor the 30 percent overall beam efficiency the required electrical power is about 2750\nkilowatts per kilogram (1250 kW/lb) of payload. The cost of the powerplant would be a\nmajor consideration and should be included in a detailed mission cost study. Although\npower requirements will be large, the powerplant cost is nonrecurring and should be\namortized over many launches. The powerplant could be used for other purposes between shots. For example, the electrical energy could be used to produce hydrogen and\noxygen, for emergency electrical power, for chemical processing, for sewage disposal,\nfor dfesalinization, etc. In addition, there may be other means for producing the high\nintermittent powers required for laser propulsion. A complete cost analysis of a whole\nsystem including factors such as this and the cost of the vehicle structure is beyond the\nscope of this report.\n\nEnergy and Propellant Cost of Placing Payload in Orbit\nThe cost of energy for placing payload in orbit with the laser propulsion system described in this report is calculated from equation (11) by using an assumed cost per unit\n10\n\nof electrical energy on Earth. Assuming the rate for large quantities of electrical energy is $1. 39x10 per joule ($0.005/kW-hr) permits the calculation of the data shown\nin figure 9. The cost for electrical energy in dollars per unit pay load mass is plotted\nas a function of specific impulse and overall beam efficiency. For a 30-percent overall\nbeam efficiency at the optimum specific impulse of 1600 seconds, the energy cost for\nplacing payload in orbit is $2. 60 per kilogram ($1. 20/lb) of payload.\nWith a projected price for large quantities of liquid hydrogen at $0. 22 per kilogram\n($0.10/lb) (ref. 3), the propellant cost is calculated from equation (12) and amounts to\n$0. 64 per kilogram ($0. 29/lb) of payload. (This is independent of overall beam efficiency. ) For the case of 30-percent beam efficiency, the combined electrical energy\nand propellant cost is then about $3. 30 per kilogram ($1. 50/lb) of payload.\n\nOTHER COMMENTS\nThe laser propulsion system proposed in this report ought to be scalable provided\nthe beam area is controlled in flight to conform to the capture area of the engine; that\nis, the cost of propelling small payloads on a per unit mass basis should not be greatly\ndifferent from that for propelling large payloads providing beam spreading is not a limitation. With such limitation large systems may be relatively more efficient. Nevertheless, it appears that the beam spreading and other problems can be studied independently\nof the laser powered engine development in small-scale ground tests. The technique of\nlaser propulsion, therefore, could be developed initially on a relatively small scale.\nThe laser beam power requirements for a vehicle with a gross weight of 454 kilograms (1000 Ib) would be about 250 megawatts for an Earth orbit mission. This would\nplace about 91 kilograms (200 Ib) of payload into Earth orbit. To place 22 700 kilograms\n(50 000 Ib) in orbit would require a total beam power of about 60 000 megawatts delivered\nto the vehicle.\nSuch high power levels are beyond the current state of the art of lasers. However,\nthere evidently does not appear to be any fundamental reason why a laser beam of this\npower is not possible (ref. 1). If it develops that a practical limit does exist and is less\nthan the total power required, then possibly many lower power lasers could be ganged\ntogether to point at a common aiming point, namely, the laser rocket, to provide the\ntotal power.\nThe technology that is currently being developed for containing gaseous fissioning\nfuel operating at temperatures of about 100 000 K (ref. 2) is directly applicable to the\nproblem of absorbing the laser beam energy in the laser rocket. In both cases very high\nintensity thermal radiation must be absorbed in a propellant gas that is heated by the absorption to temperatures measured in tens of thousands of degrees Kelvin. The energy\nmust be almost completely absorbed by gases and/or vapors or solid seed particles\n11\n\nwhich are subsequently vaporized. If not, then the radiation intensity is sufficient to\nvaporize the walls from which the propellant flows. Reference 2 indicates potential\nfeasibility of absorbing sufficient radiation in gases enclosed in walls operating at room\ntemperature to produce specific impulses in the range of 5000 to 7000 seconds. The radiant absorption and wall shielding in the laser nozzle may be reduced because the pressures will be lower than the 1000 atmospheres of the gas core. In addition, the wall\nshielding mechanism, as well as other processes in the nozzle such as expansion with\nnonunif orm heat addition and radiant transport of heat, require additional study to determine maximum specific impulse more precisely.\nBeam spreading and transmission through the atmosphere require additional investigation. Information in these areas would apply to the present laser propulsion concept,\nas well as to the general problem of efficient laser-beam power transmission from\nEarth to a spacecraft. The beam spreading effects of atmospheric turbulence, as well\nas refractive index change (due to local atmospheric heating), are being studied elsewhere. For all weather operation, beam scattering and attenuation by clouds, smog,\nand precipitation in the atmosphere need to be investigated further. Also, research is\nneeded on lasers that operate efficiently at wavelengths where atmospheric absorption is\nminimized. For precise beam pointing the response rate and driving torque capabilities\nof present star tracking systems probably need to be increased.\nLaser propulsion may be used for other missions. It may be desirable to use it for\nhigher AV missions than for placing payload in Earth orbit. Either higher acceleration\nor longer beam path lengths would have to be used in this case. Another interesting application may be for a global Earth transportation system. The vehicle would be accelerated into a ballistic trajectory and then land at its destination either by aerodynamic\nbraking and gliding or by means of a reverse laser braking propulsion system.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe following conclusions were drawn from this study of the use of an Earth-based\nhigh-power laser beam to provide energy for Earth-launched rocket vehicles:\n1. It appears feasible to use Earth-based laser beams to provide energy to accelerate pay loads from the surface of the Earth to Earth orbits.\n2. An order of magnitude reduction in hardware weight (hence cost) per kilogram of\npayload delivered to orbit may be possible by using the laser propulsion scheme described in this report in place of conventional chemical rocket powered launch systems.\n(The payload fraction is about an order of magnitude higher.)\n3. The laser propulsion system requires a very large ground-based power supply\nthat is used intermittently. Unless the powerplant is used for other purposes, or unless\n12\n\na special low-cost power supply is devised, the major cost of placing payload in orbit\nwith a laser propulsion system will probably be the amortization of the power supply.\n4. The cost of electrical energy for placing payload in Earth orbit by using laser\nbeam propulsion would be about $2.60 per kilogram ($1. 20/lb) if 30 percent of the\nground-based electrical energy used for the laser were transmitted to the vehicle. The\ncorresponding propellant cost is $0.64 per kilogram ($0. 29/lb) of payload.\n5. The optimum specific impulse for placing pay loads in Earth orbits is in the range\nof 1200 to 2000 seconds. This is to be compared to the 5000 seconds which probably is\nattainable for the laser system by using gas-core nuclear rocket technology.\nf\n\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, January 31, 1972,\n112-28.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
