When the new system design is incorporated into the broader group of systems, the performance of the operator-level objective can be sub-optimal due to the unmodeled interaction between the new system and the other systems. Among the few available references that describe attempts to address this disconnect, most follow an MDO (Multidisciplinary Design Optimization)-motivated sequential decomposition approach of first designing a very good system and then providing this system to the operator who, decides the best way to use this new system along with the existing systems. This paper addresses this issue by including aircraft design, airline operations, and revenue management \"subspaces\"; and presents an approach that could simultaneously solve these subspaces posed as a monolithic optimization problem rather than the traditional approach described above. The monolithic approach makes the problem an expensive Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming problem, which are extremely difficult to solve. To address the problem, we use a recently developed optimization framework that simultaneously solves the subspaces to capture the \"synergy\" in the problem that the previous decomposition approaches did not exploit, addresses mixed-integer/discrete type design variables in an efficient manner, and accounts for computationally expensive analysis tools. This approach solves an 11-route airline network problem consisting of 94 decision variables including 33 integer and 61 continuous type variables. Simultaneously solving the subspaces leads to significant improvement in the fleet-level objective of the airline when compared to the previously developed sequential subspace decomposition approach.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180004468, "endDate": "2018-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "d7f02cbcaafe4c9aa229d9fac4b54666", "id": "8a406527c58945abbab7bfdcf82fb746"}], "name": "2018 AIAA SciTech Forum", "location": "Kissimmee, FL", "id": "d7f02cbcaafe4c9aa229d9fac4b54666", "startDate": "2018-01-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180004468, "id": "fff679c486104ad4aa35c87ed5d110db", "publicationDate": "2018-01-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180004468.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180004468/downloads/20180004468.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180004468/downloads/20180004468.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180004468/downloads/20180004468.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
