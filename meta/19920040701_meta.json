Waste composition definitions are needed for the design of waste-processing technologies involved in closing major life support functions in future long-duration human space missions. Tables of data for the constituents and chemical formulas of the following waste streams are presented and discussed: human urine, feces, hygiene (laundry and shower) water, cleansing agents, trash, humidity condensate, dried sweat, and trace contaminants. Tables of data on dust generation and pH values of the different waste streams are also presented and discussed.", "title": "Waste streams in a crewed space habitat", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920040701, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wydeven, T."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "0f5061c240764914adbdde4a77e89f4e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920040701, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Golub, M.
