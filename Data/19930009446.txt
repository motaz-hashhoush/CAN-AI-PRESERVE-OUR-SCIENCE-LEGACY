Summary\nThe 2nd Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) Thruster Workshop was held at the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lewis Research Center on May 19, 1992. There\nwere 32 participants, including experts from NASA, the Department of Energy (DOE), the\nDepartment of Defense (DOD), and academia. Six government laboratories and six universities\nwere represented at the workshop, the purpose of which was to review technical progress made\nsince the last meeting held at NASA Headquarters in 1991 and discuss plans for future work.\nSpecifically, the meeting focussed on progress made in establishing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 performance and lifetime expectations of MPD Thrusters as functions of power,\npropellant, and design,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 models for the plasma flow and electrode components,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 viability and transportability of quasi-steady thruster testing,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 engineering requirements for high power, long life thrusters, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 facilities and their requirements for performance and life testing.\nA two hour discussion period followed programmatic presentations by representatives of NASA\nHeadquarters and reviews of technical progress by the research organizations working on MPD\nthrusters.\t\nDuring this period the workshop participants established lists of Key Technical\nIssues in five areas: Anode, Cathode, Flow, Modeling, and Diagnostics.\nCommittees were then formed for each of these areas to prioritize and establish\napproaches for resolving the highest priority items. Following the workshop, the\ncommittee chairmen contacted all the committee members to solicit inputs. Final reports for each\narea were prepared which are presented in subsequent sections.\nThe overriding theme that emerged from the workshop was the need to\nimprove the coordination among the various groups working on MPD thruster\ntechnology. This is true for both experimental and theoretical efforts. At present it is impossible\nto compare the various efforts due to the large differences in the approaches and devices studied.\nSpecific recommendations were established by the committees to foster a more unified approach,\nand an effort should be made to ensure continued communication between the various research\ngroups.\nThe purposes of these Proceedings are to disseminate the workshop results and\ndocument the status of MPD thruster technology such that progress can be\nquantified. It is critical that we show measureable progress toward realistic goals.\nFollowing a list of action items established by the committees and the committee reports, a brief\nsummary of the presentations and key discussions is provided. Descriptions of the technical\nefforts underway at each organization are given in this section. Copies of the presentation graphics\nare presented in the Appendices.\n\nII. Action Items\nThe following action items were established at the workshop and by the various committees.\nPlease provide the following inputs to Roger Myers (LeRC) by December 15, 1992:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Respond on feasibility of running MPD thruster codes on geometries and operating\ncondition matrix established by modeling committee. Provide results if possible.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Respond on suggestions for standardized experimental configuration(s).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide list of observed failure/gross erosion mechanisms for all thruster components\n(eg. gross melting of anode, localized pitting, thermal stress, etc.)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide responses to issues raised in Anode, Cathode, Flow, and Modeling Committee\nReports. Specifically, there were many issues concerning the applicability of particular\nmodels and experimental approaches which must be addressed to demonstrate that\nthe community is moving forward.\nInputs will be included in a newsletter to be sent out in January of 1993.\nIn addition to these, Dave Byers of LeRC requested that the community prepare two\ncharts which summarize progress made each year. The first is a plot of efficiency\nand specific impulse vs. year. This would show performance improvements in a given year,\nand would represent the best measured performance and/or best estimates from the latest models.\nThe second chart would show thruster lifetime vs. year, and would again show the maximum\ndemonstrated and/or best estimate for thruster lifetime based on experiments and models. These\ncharts will be updated at each MPD thruster workshop, and should represent a consensus of the\nMPD thruster community. To initiate this process the following is proposed for 1992 based on\napplied-field thruster results obtained at LeRC:\nWO nrr\t\nllnn+ QQ kW\nn.\nIn\n\na\nc\n\nArgon\t propellant\n60 kW\n\nai\n\nai\nE\n\nU\nC\nM\n\nE\n\n0\n\nAnode\t sputtering\ncaused\t failure\n30\n\nJ\n\nw\n\nU\n\nn\n\n1992\n\nIPerfor\n\n1992\n\nLifetime\n\nPlease provide input for an update to be distributed in January.\n\nIII. Committee Reports\nIII. A. Anode Committee\nChairman: Roger Myers\nAnode Committee inputs were received from K. Diamant , A. Gallimore, R. Gerwin, M.\nMartinez-Sanchez, E. Niewood, J. Polk, D. Tilley, and P.Turchi.\nGeneral Comments:\nIn general, all committee members had difficulty with separating the key technical issues,\nfeeling strongly that the various aspects of anode power deposition were strongly coupled. As a\nresult, the following write-up does not exactly follow the listing of Key Technical Issues which\nwas established at the workshop. Several committee members pointed out that there are sufficient\nuncertainties in our understanding of the dominant physics (especially for the wide range of\ndevices the community is studying) that we must not focus too narrowly on a particular\naspect of anode power deposition (such as voltage drops) for fear that we will miss a major\ncontributor to the anode power loss. This emphasizes the importance of direct measurements\nof the anode power loss.\nAll committee members felt that a purely experimental approach runs the risk of missing the\nsolution to the anode problem. All emphasized the requirement for local plasma property\nmeasurements in the anode region, and the strong coupling of the flow and anode\nphysics. All were concerned about establishing the appropriate model/experiment balance.\nAlmost all modeling is currently done on self-field devices. Applied-field devices have\nclearly shown higher steady-state performance at power levels of interest. This is a potential\nproblem in that the self-field plasma boundary conditions are probably completely\ndifferent than they are in applied-field devices (Gerwin). This most fact that the appliedfield lines intersect the electrode surface.\n\nIssue Prioritization and specific comments:\n1. Anode Fall (uniformly picked as the key issue)\nExperimental Approaches:\nMajor emphasis should be placed on identifying causes of anode fall voltage and ways to\nreduce it. The same techniques for reducing anode loss were advocated by all who commented.\nThese were:\nAnode gas injection to reduce Hall parameter\nModify magnetic field/anode shape to permit parallel electron current to the anode\nReduce magnetic field strength at anode surface.\nWhile most work must be done on actual thrusters, fundamental studies can likely be done\nin small benchtop experiments (Myers, Gallimore, Tilley). In the role of fundamental physics\nstudies, these experiments need not be faithful simulations of the thruster environment (Polk),\n\nhowever, care must be exercised when extrapolating the results to thruster anodes. For the latter,\nextreme care is likely required to ensure that the test conditions, including current and plasma\ndensity, temperature, magnetic field, etc., are close to those observed in actual thrusters. It will\nprobably be difficult to match plasma velocities. To ensure use of appropriate test conditions,\nlocal diagnostics of the anode plasma in thrusters and bench-top experiments are required.\nIn addition, appropriate engineering judgement should be used to ensure that all studies are\ndone for realistic conditions. This is particularly an issue with quasi-steady testing, where\nthrusters can easily be operated at surface power densities where there is no expectation of building\na practical device. For example, reasonable anode power and current density limits can be\nestablished based on lifetime and heat transfer considerations. Given our relatively poor\nunderstanding of anode physics, it is doubtful that data taken under conditions very different from\nthose for which actual thrusters can be built will be transportable to relevant operating conditions.\n2 Modelling:\nThere currently appear to be two dominant theories for anode power deposition,\none relying on classical transport and anode plasma depletion (currently investigated at MIT), the\nother relying on anomalous transport (currently investigated at Princeton). It is clearly necessary\nto use the models and associated experiments to establish which of these mechanisms is dominant.\nIssues with current models:\nAbsence of sheath models (Gallimore, Myers)\nUse of continuum model (fluid) near wall (Martinez-Sanchez, Gerwin),\nNeglect of several heat transfer terms (Gerwin) t\nWall effects on electron gyrations (Martinez-Sanchez),\nUse of homogeneous plasma approximation for microturbulence near wall (MartinezSanchez),\nCoupling of flow-field/boundary layer (Martinez-Sanchez, Gerwin, Turchi)\nImpact of magnetic field and electrode geometry on anode fall1flow field (Gerwin, Myers)\nNeed to include ionization/recombination phenomena in anode models (Myers)\nGiven the diversity of approaches and boundary conditions, it is quite difficult to establish\nregions of model validity. It appears to be very important to establish a few standard geometries\nand operating conditions with which to compare WHICH ALL MODELS CAN RUN (Gerwin,\nMyers). This would permit valid comparisons of the results of the various modeling approaches.\n3. Diagnostics:\nA detailed listing of suggested diagnostics, advantages and disadvantages of each, and a list\nof contacts and references is provided in the Diagnostics Committee report. However, several\nissues specific to anode studies were raised by the committee which are discussed below.\n\nt Gerwin has indicated that a more careful consideration of the heat flux to the anode (following Braginskii,\nS.I., in Reviews of Plasma Physics, Vol. 1, Consultants Bureau, A A. Leontovich, ed., 1965) reveals that several\nterms usually neglected in the analysis of anode power deposition become substantially larger under certain\nconditions.\n\n4\n\nDirect measurements of anode power deposition must be correlated with\ndetailed maps of all plasma parameters which control it. This is the only way to\nproperly identify mechanisms of power loss. Required measurements definitely include the\nplasma potential, electron temperature and density, current density, magnetic field strength, and\nradiated flux (predominantly from hot cathode), and may include the ion velocity, and ion\ntemperature. Diagnostics are also needed to evaluate the role of microturbulence (Tilley).\nSuggested resolution ranged from 1 mm to 0.01 mm, and property maps must address both radial\nand axial variations (Niewood). Note that the only thruster geometry for which both detailed power\ndeposition and plasma parameter maps exist is the Princeton benchmark thruster (and two slight\nvariations of it), a geometry for which the anode power density was found to be far above that\nacceptable for viable devices and which is extremely difficult to model (Gerwin, Myers, Turchi).\nStudies are clearly required using other geometries which eliminate these issues.\nProbe diagnostics in the near anode region may highly perturb the anode fall region. In\naddition, the distribution function near the anode is expected be non-Maxwellian due to the\nabsorbing nature of the surface, which will likely complicate the data reduction. While work at\nPrinceton is not detecting any significant problems with probes within 0.1 mm of the anode\n(Diamant, see Appendix C), there is clearly a need to develop non-invasive diagnostics for the\nnear-anode plasma.\nSpecific experimental suggestions:\nGallimore:\nUse of Langmuir probes to map the near anode region (to within 0.5 mm) in thrusters and\nbenchtop experiments, and the use of benchtop experiments to establish fundamental\ncorrelations between plasma conditions, geometry, and magnetic field configuration.\nNeed to establish differences, if any, between quasi-steady and steady-state thruster anode\nphenomena. Could be done with a benchtop experiment.\nDesign experiment where anode is shielded from hot cathode to assess impact of cathode\nradiation.\n4,\t\n\nFacility effects:\n\nThis is important only insofar as the community is careful to ensure all testing is done\nunder conditions for which the tank pressure does not affect anode power\ndeposition. This value is usually placed at 5 x 10- 4 torr. As long as this requirement is met,\nfacility effects are not an issue.\n\nS. Others\nLower priority items which should be addressed after the above include stability,\nsymmetry, and fluid turbulence. In addition, until the performance of thrusters improves and we\ncan identify specific geometries which satisfy mission performance requirements, it is premature to\nstudy mechanisms of anode heat rejection and select anode materials.\n\nIII. B. Cathode Committee\nChairman: Jay Polk\nInputs were received K. Goodfellow, M. Mantenieks, R. Moses, R. Myers, P. Turchi,\nand W. Stirling.\nGeneral Comments\nAll respondents agreed that the primary issue with the cathode is its lifetime.\nAlthough the heat transfer to the cathode represents a thermal loss, its impact on performance is\nrelatively low. Cathode failure will likely be defined as the point at which cathode damage leads to\nunacceptably low performance or an inability to start the engine. Cathode damage may also\nprecipitate failure of other components. A number of failure modes were identified, but the most\ntroublesome are likely to be evaporation and possibly sputtering. There was no\nconsensus on the proper methodology to use in establishing cathode reliability. Modeling of\ncathode processes was felt by all respondents to be important. The emphasis should be on\nmodeling cathode thermal behavior and erosion processes. The most important physical\nprocesses identified by the committee were work function, magnetic field and\npropellant effects, and the detailed erosion and mass transport processes. To\nidentify failure modes, validate models and provide input informantion for models a number of\nmeasurements were suggested. The highest priorities were measuring cathode\ntemperature, erosion rates, and work function. Most respondents felt that hollow\ncathodes had the highest potential for long life, and that the best materials were\nlikely to be barium compounds in tungsten or lanthanum oxide in molybdenum.\nCathode Failure\nDefinitions\nFailure may be defined as the point at which cathode wear results in\nintolerable degradation in engine performance. Testing and modeling will be required to\ndetermine what effect wear will have on performance (Polk), but one likely result is an increase in\nvoltage with a corresponding decrease in efficiency (Myers). Stirling suggests that a decrease in\nrestart reliability will be the first indication of failure, based on his experience with quasi-hollow\ncathodes for ion sources. In addition, cathode wear has been observed to cause anode or insulator\nfailures at ORNL, and Stirling recommends in particular that insulators be shielded from the\ndischarge.\nFailure Modes\nArcing due to transients has been observed in the quasi-hollow cathode at ORNL and\nmelting may occur as a result of aging (Stirling). Insulator failure can also occur as a result of\nexposure to the plasma or cathode start-up erosion products (Stirling). Thermal runaway\ncaused by loss of low work function impregnates or increased Joule heating due to diameter\nchanges is the most common failure mode observed in steady-state applied-field thruster testing at\nLeRC (Myers). Internal melting leading to cavity formation and cathode rupture has occurred\nin high-current steady-state thruster testing at Stuttgart. Oxidizing impurities in the\npropellant were also found to dramatically increase cathode erosion at Stuttgart, and to modify\nthe erosion pattern at LeRC (Mantenieks, Myers). Significant tip melting was observed in\ncathodes with conical tips in steady-state applied-field thrusters at JPL, but this problem was\nsolved with the use of hemispherical-tipped cathodes (Polk). Cathode fracture has also occurred\n\noccasionally at LeRC and Princeton. However, a number of these failures probably represent\nimmature designs. A mature cathode design is probably going to be subject to wear primarily by\nevaporation or sputtering, with transport of the erosion products through the ambient gas playing a\nsignificant role in determining loss rates.\nEstablishing Reliability\nThere was considerable spread in opinions on this issue. Stirling replied that there is no\nsubstitute for testing, and Myers argued that the testing conditions must be appropriate. The\ncathode behavior in engines must be understood before any methodology can be applied.\nGoodfellow emphasized that the coupling between performance and lifetime must be\nunderstood. In addition, Polk and Goodfellow commented that testing alone is insufficient to\nestablish lifetime iii a statistically significant manner, and that a probabilistic treatment of the\navailable analytical and experimental results is the best approach to quantitatively assessing\nreliability.\nCathode Modeling\nModel Regions\nThe responses were also somewhat scattered in this area. Stirling, although confessing\nless knowledge of this area, replied that he thought modeling was very important and that the focus\nshould be on the sheath, boundary layers and the core plasma flow. Polk responded that the\nsolid, surface, sheath, ionization zone and core flow are the highest priority model areas, with the\nboundary layers (momentum, thermal and concentration) and pre-sheath being less important.\nMoses emphasized that the sheath region, particularly current transport, must be understood.\nMyers, based on observations of applied-field thrusters at LeRC, chose the ionization zone,\nparticularly the effect of non-maxwellian emitted electrons, as the highest priority, with the solid,\nsurface, sheath and pre-sheath as secondary issues which have been modeled previously for\ncathodes in other discharges. Goodfellow ranked the regions in terms of modeling priority by\nprogressing out from the surface. The solid, surface, sheath and pre-sheath should be addressed\nfirst, then the boundary layers, and finally the core plasma flow. Turchi\'s reply emphasized the\nimportance of matching the flow to the nonlinearities encountered near the wall, and suggested the\npotential for decoupling the cathode plasma from the main plasma flow with the use of a hollow\ncathode. While groups from other fields have modeled the cathode sheath and presheath region,\nthere hasn\'t been a successful attempt to couple these models to the cathode thermal characteristics\nand the plasma flow field (Myers).\nCathode Phenomena\nCathode work function was identified as one of the most important\nphenomena in cathode modeling (Polk, Goodfellow) as well as the effect of the magnetic\nfield (Myers, Mantenieks, Polk, Stirling), particularly in light of observations at LeRC. The\npropellant gas can also have a significant effect (Myers), particularly for alkali metal propellants\nwhich may alter the work function (Polk). Thermal-field emission was chosen as the most\nimportant emission mechanism to study. Moses emphasized the importance of understanding the\ncomponents of current transport, and Polk ranked the distinction between microspot and diffuse\nattachment as a high priority for quasi-steady operation. The impact of anomalous transport in the\ncathode region was generally ranked as a low priority, except by Stirling. The erosion\nmechanisms were rated one of the highest priority phenomena to study by Polk because erosion is\nthe primary concern, but Myers rated erosion mechanisms as the last priority, arguing that the other\n\nphenomena must be addressed first. Because chemistry plays an integral role in the determination\nof the work function and in chemical attack on the cathode, it must be addressed in assessing\nalternate materials and testing requirements (Myers, Polk). The role of eroded product transport\nthrough the ambient gas was rated as a high priority by Polk. The only transient effects identified\nby the respondents as important were transient arcs (Stirling) and activator depletion (Goodfellow).\nExperimental Requirements for Model InoutsNerification\nMeasurement of erosion rates and temperature distributions were identified\nby all respondents as the highest priority because these are the most important model\npredictions. Stirling also ranked the measurement of potential distributions high. Moses felt that\nthe detailed profiles of electron and ion temperature, density and current, as well as magnetic and\nelectric fields in the near-cathode region should be measured, although achieving adequate spatial\nresolution in the sheath region may be difficult. Cathode work function (Goodfellow, Polk) and\nthe extent of the attachment zone (Polk) were also identified.\nCathode Testing and Design\nFacility Effects\nAmbient pressure was identified as the most important facility parameter, and Mantenieks\npointed out that the species present in the ambient gas can be important. A good example is the\npartial pressure of pump oil in the facility. The purity of the propellant itself was also listed as an\nimportant consideration. The effect of the flow field, power supply interactions and plume\ninteractions were considered to be less important in cathode studies. The only comment on the\nimportance of power level scaling was that we should concentrate on 100 kWe class steady-state\nengines and megawatt class quasi-steady thrusters (Myers).\nCathode Concepts\nConventional rod-shaped cathodes have little potential, but might provide adequate lifetime\nif they are constructed as dispenser or reservoir cathodes (Myers, Mantenieks, Polk) or\ncontinuously fed into the engine (Stirling). Hollow cathodes were identified by all as a\ntechnology with high potential for meeting MPD thruster cathode requirements. Turchi\'s\nresponse outlined a number of particular advantages to the use of hollow cathodes, including more\ncontrol over the cathode plasma, greater retention of the energy radiated from the\nemitting surface, a higher vapor pressure, which reduces the evaporation rate,\nand decoupling of the cathode plasma from the main discharge plasma. Stirling\nsuggested the use of a quasi-hollow cathode similar to that used in ion sources at ORNL. They\nhave demonstrated operation at up to 1000 A, but have not attempted operation beyond several\nhours. Externally heated cathodes were identified as important only for quasi-steady operation\n(Myers). Moses suggested that appropriate shaping of the magnetic field near the cathode might\nminimize the thermal and momentum losses to the cathode.\nCathode Materials\nThe consensus was that low work function, high melting temperature, low\nresistivity and mechanical integrity are the most important material properties for\nMPD thruster cathodes. From a list of candidate cathode materials, barium compounds in a\ntungsten matrix (Myers, Mantenieks, Polk), thoriated tungsten (Goodfellow) and lanthanum oxide\nin a molybdenum matrix (Stirling) were identified as the ones with most potential. Mantenieks\n\nresponded that lanthanum hexaboride is too brittle, and Stirling indicated that lanthanum oxide in\nmolybdenum has similar emission capabilities, but is less brittle. Pure tungsten was thought by all\nto be of little or no use.\nment\nCathode Thermal Management\nThis area did not appear to be a high priority, because cathode heat fluxes are relatively\nlow. Regenerative cooling was generally identified as the best approach, with heat pipes and\nradiators listed as less important technologies.\nCathode Design Impact on Performance\nThe current capability and geometry were generally considered to be the\ncathode parameters with the greatest impact on thruster performance. The power\nloss associated with heat transfer to the cathode was listed by Stirling and Turchi, although\nMantenieks suggested that it is fairly small. Of the other suggested effects, the cathode\'s impact on\ncurrent contours was listed as a somewhat higher effect than its effect on voltage and its role as a\nsource of impurities.\nParticipating Organizations Interests and Activities\nA number of cathode phenomena are being studied both experimentally and theoretically at\nthe government and university laboratories that participated in the questionnaire. JPL has\ndeveloped a cathode thermal code using boundary conditions supplied by a model of the cathode\nsheath, pre-sheath and ionization zone. Models which predict the cathode work function for\nthoriated tungsten cathodes and cathodes immersed in alkali metal vapors have been developed and\nare being incorporated into the thermal model. The temperature distributions given by the thermal\ncode can be used with a set of existing models which describe the dominant erosion mechanisms to\npredict mass loss rates. A dedicated high-current cathode test facility is being established which\nwill be used to obtain model input parameters and validate model predictions, as well as develop\nnew cathode concepts and perform long duration cathode tests. Another large facility is being\nestablished to test lithium MPD thrusters. A component of that program will be to determine the\neffect of lithium on cathode lifetime. The ultimate goal is to develop the analytical tools to calculate\nprior distributions of cathode failure probability and update these distributions with information\nfrom endurance tests in a Bayesian framework to yield quantitative estimates of cathode lifetime\nthat incorporate all available information. Specific milestones for the next year include the\ndevelopment of a two-dimensional thermal model, collection of a database of measurements to test\nthe model predictions, and identification of a cathode design for a 2000 hour endurance test at 2500\nA.\nLANL is involved in the development of large scale MPD thrusters and the testing of a\ngeometry with a magnetic field generated by a solenoid located inside the cathode. While they are\nnot actively studying the cathode phenomena, they are using a variety of diagnostics to establish\ncurrent and electric potential distributions and measure cathode power deposition.\nThe major focus of LeRC is on testing of rod and hollow cathode geometries made from\nboth 2% thoriated tungsten and barium impregnated tungsten in applied-field MPD thrusters. The\ntesting is devoted to measuring performance and lifetime, such that the fundamental coupling\nbetween the two can be established. The MPD thruster cathode studies currently include surface\ntemperature, weight-loss and surface morphology measurements as a function of thruster operating\nconditions and cathode geometry. There is considerable work being done to establish the impact of\npropellant impurities and feed system contamination on cathode life. While most of the work is\n\n9\n\nexperimental, there is an ongoing hollow cathode modelling effort underway in collaboration with\nOhio State University. An experimental program of internal hollow cathode diagnostics has also\nbeen initiated to validate the model. The potential for high efficiency, high power pulsed MPD\nthruster systems led to the initiation of an effort to establish the feasibility and practicality of\nlong-life pulsed cathodes using internal heaters. Assuming successful demonstration of a low\nerosion, 10 kA pulsed cathode, a thruster will be built and sent to Princeton University for testing.\nORNL has developed "quasi-hollow cathodes" for ion beam acceleration and neutralization.\nThese cathodes are the evolutionary result of development starting with a duoplasmatron version.\nThe cathodes are characterized by low temperature emitters (lanthanum oxide-molybdenum)\noperating in a magnetic field free, high density gas discharge with the main arc voltage appearing\nacross a double sheath at the cathode exit, which is in a region of magnetic field constriction. The\nvoltage drop at the surface is between 20 and 30 volts. Thus, emitter erosion is minimal and the\nemission temperature is maintained by resistive heating. The highest current cathode to date is\n1000 A, limited by ion source requirements. This application requires test pulses no longer than\n30 seconds in duration. However, this cathode was run for an accumulated time of 3.3 hours at\n30% duty cycle over a two day period with no obvious signs of wear.\nAs mentioned above, Ohio State is concentrating on the development of a first principles\nmodel of hollow cathode behavior. Generation of data to validate the model is presently underway\nby an OSU student at NASA LeRC. The MACH2 MHD code is also being applied by another\nstudent in order to model the overall MPD thruster flow field.\nPrinceton University is developing a porous tungsten cathode fed from a lithium reservoir.\nThis geometry should be capable of maintaining a layer of lithium on the cathode surface to reduce\nthe work function and will also serve to seed the main discharge with lithium vapor. Princeton\nmay also participate with LeRC in the testing of an externally heated cathode for pulsed thruster\noperation.\n\n10\n\nIII. C. Flow Committee\nChairman: Roger Myers\nFlow Committee inputs were received from E. Choueiri, B. Hooper, M. LaPointe, R.\nMayo, N. Roderick, D. Tilley, and P. Turchi.\nGeneral Comments\nIn all the contributions, there was an emphasis on the need for numerical simulations. All\npointed out that codes can offer insight into problems at considerably lower expense than\nexperimental work. However, the codes must be reliable predictors of at least some\nof the experimentally observed parameters before the program can rely on them\nfor guidance. In fact, it has only been in the past couple of years, in work by Martinez-Sanchez\nand LaPointe, that the codes have been used to show the benefits of modifying the thruster\ngeometry (Myers). A relevant MHD code, MACH2, has been successfully used in extremely\ncomplex simulations of plasma flow switches, where complex geometries and both self-induced\nand applied magnetic field effects must be included (Turchi). In addition, it is extremely\nimportant that a standard set of geometries and operating conditions be chosen for code\ndevelopment which will permit valid comparisons to be made between the codes (LaPointe,\nMyers). The need to match simulation with experiment led to a loud call for\nimproved in-chamber diagnostics (Roderick, Tilley, Mayo, LaPointe).\nOtherwise, there was some disagreement in the flow committee about what the immediate\nemphases should be. Two "camps" could be discerned. The first advocated a primary emphasis\non establishing the effects of microinstabilities, including ionization and transport phenomena.\nThe second advocated a primary emphasis on studies of acceleration mechanisms (principally in\napplied-Field thrusters), the effects of magnetic field and electrode geometry, plasma/field\nseparation, etc., followed by work on anomalous transport phenomena. It is likely, however, that\nsuccessful modeling will involve the simultaneous study of both of these arenas, as they are\nstrongly coupled (Turchi, Hooper). It is critical that information flow freely and\nfrequently among various groups to ensure rapid progress. The following summarizes the two\nviews.\nMicroinstability effects\nA large part of the discrepancy between predicted and measured terminal voltage is likely\nthe result of anomalous resistivity (Choueiri). We need to establish operating conditions where\ninstabilities affect thruster performance significantly (Tilley, Choueiri). This can be done by using\nnewly developed anomalous resistivity equations to properly evaluate the impact in MHD codes.\nThis work must be expanded to solve for the electron distribution function which can be coupled\nto a collisional radiative model for ionization (Choueiri). Once these numerical techniques have\nbeen developed they can be coupled to MHD codes for thruster optimization.\nOn the experimental side, Langmuir probe techniques should be used to establish the\nspatial distributions of the various instability modes and to directly measure the electron\ndistribution function (Tilley, Choueiri). In addition, measurements of plasma resistivity, like\nthose of Lovberg and Gallimore, would greatly assist in verification of non-linear micro instability\n\n11\n\nmodels (Tilley).\nAn unexplored avenue to mitigating the instability is active wave damping. This\nshould be attempted and may provide a way to independently control the effects of instabilities\nwithout forced modifications of geometry and operating condition (Choueiri). However, the\nincreased complexity of the associated power supplies runs counter to a principal\nadvantage of MPD thrusters \xe2\x80\x94 that of their simplicity (Turchi).\nIssues to be resolved Effect of propellant species, ionization energy, mass, etc. (Choueiri, Turchi, Myers),\nInfluence of applied field on microturbulence (Choueiri, Myers).\nLack of particle simulations of MPD thruster plasmas (Choueiri, Turchi).\nDifficulty of modellexperiment comparisons until electrode boundaries are included in\nmodels (Myers).\nThere are clearly several ways to address these issues, including use of models and\nexperimental measurements. Specifically, the Princeton MHD model should be used to evaluate\nthe effect of propellant species on microinstabilities, and power spectra and wavelength\nmeasurements should be made throughout the chamber of an MPD thruster to establish the spatial\ndependence of the phenomena (Tilley).\nClassical Approach:\nThe emphasis in this group was on establishing the parametric dependence of acceleration\nmechanisms, performance, and plasma properties on electrode and magnetic field geometry.\nPlasma/magnetic field detachment was also raised as a principal concern for applied-field thrusters\n(Mayo).\nIn general, the consensus was that a hierarchy of models needs to be worked on (Turchi,\nChoueiri, LaPointe):\n1. continuum 2-D axisymmetric geometry, single temperature, with an ideal gas law\na. include applied magnetic fields\n2. Two temperature continuum with equilibrium ionization/dissociation\n3. include non-LTE ionization/dissociation, but only classical transport\n4. introduce anomalous transport and kinetics\n5. add electrode models\nThere are currently several groups with models past part (1), though only Ohio State\nincludes applied-fields. With simplified geometries, including insulators at the exit plane, MIT and\nPrinceton have advanced to stage (3), though there are some differences in the approaches,\nincluding neglect of viscosity in the Princeton model. The LeRC and OSU models are the only\nones which include a full plume expansion and the cathode tip region, both of which have been\nfound to result in some numerical problems (LaPointe). Princeton and OSU are the only groups\nnow including anomalous resistivity, and Princeton has developed an improved model for the\nanomalous resistivity. There is a more complete discussion of model status in the Modelling\nCommittee report.\n\n12\n\nExperimental\nThe combined overall performance and electrode loss measurements indicate that the\nefficiency with which plasma power is converted to thrust power is generally not high (Myers),\nthough it exceeds 60% in some cases. This clearly dictates the need for continued direct\nperformance measurements, and the establishment of good velocity and ionization state\nmeasurement techniques. It is extremely important that diagnostics be developed to accurately\nestablish the scaling of flow losses, so that we can decouple them from electrode losses.\nSeveral other points were raised in the context of better isolating the flow phenomena from\nwall effects. These include the need to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Make the measurements using a thruster geometry which everybody can model (see the\nModeling Committee report).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Measure anode and cathode fall voltages directly to isolate plasma voltage drop. This\nshould take precedence over more demanding measurements of streamline shape, Te and\nNe distributions, etc. (Martinez-Sanchez).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Obtain maps of plasma properties in the chamber and plume for thruster geometries\nwhich are being modeled (LaPointe).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Directly measure the ion temperature and velocity (Tilley).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 External heating of the cathode to eliminate spot-mode emission as a variable. This may\nhave a substantial effect on the cathode fall voltage (Martinez-Sanchez, Myers).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Increase the precision of current density maps. This is especially needed near the anode\nsurface.\nSpecific techniques for these measurements are discussed in the Diagnostics Committee\nreport.\n\nLower priority issues\nPlasma radiation, divergence, and profile losses were felt to be minor issues by most,\nthough the decrease in flow efficiency with increasing thruster size reported for applied field\nthrusters has yet to be explained and they may play a role. Additionally, the way in which "lossy"\nplasma/magnetic field detachment manifests itself is unclear, and may result in increased\ndivergence losses.\n\n13\n\nIII. D. Modeling Committee\nCharmain: Mike LaPointe\nCommittee input was provided by E. Choueiri, R. Gerwin, K. Goodfellow, M.\nMartinez-Sanchez, R. Myers, E. Niewood, N. Roderick, E. Sheppard, and P. Turchi.\nGeneral Summary\nThe MPD thruster modeling committee was formed to review the status of current MPD\nthruster models and to propose directions for the development of more advanced simulations. An\noverview of current MPD thruster modeling efforts is presented below, followed by a prioritized\nlist of the key physics issues which must be addressed as the modeling efforts evolve. In\ngeneral, the committee agreed that the basic acceleration processes (electrothermal and\nelectromagnetic) are sufficiently well understood for self-field MPD thrusters, although they are\nnot well understood for applied-field thrusters. There was a strong consensus that electrode\nmodels capable of predicting fall voltages and electrode power deposition must be\ndeveloped and incorporated into the existing flow models to accurately predict MPD thruster\nperformance. There was unanimous agreement on the need to compare the numerical\nmodels with one another and with experimental results, using a set of standard\nthruster geometries and operating conditions. A matrix of geometries was\nestablished and is included in this report. Committee members were generally not\nreceptive to the idea of establishing a common code at this time. The preferred method was to seek\na consensus on the relevant physics that each code should incorporate, and to continually\ncross-check the models as they are developed and refined. In addition, there may be a need to\ndevelop particle simulations to model thruster regions where non-continuum effects might be\nimportant, such as the plume region and plasma/electrode interfaces. Particle simulations would\nalso provide insight into the evolution and saturation mechanisms of observed plasma\nmicroinstabilities, propellant ionization processes, and a host of additional effects which would\ncomplement the continuum flow models.\nReview of MPD Thruster Simulations\nA brief review of the status of MPD thruster models was deemed necessary to provide a\nbenchmark against which progress can be reported. This review is limited to work by members of\nthe modeling committee, and does not represent the numerous modeling efforts, both national and\ninternational, which are devoted to understanding the complex dynamics of the MPD thruster. An\noverview of the various modeling activities can be found in the review paper by Myers et al. [1].\nChoueiri et al. [2] have developed a detailed analytical model describing the occurrence of\ncurrent-driven plasma microinstabilities in MPD thrusters. The model predicts that the generalized\nlower hybrid drift instability plays a dominant role in turbulent dissipation and the concurrent\ndegradation of plasma thruster efficiency. Analytic forms for the associated anomalous transport\ncoefficients were obtained, and incorporated into a numerical flow model developed by Caldo et al.\n[3]. The numerical model is a fully two-dimensional (21D), two-fluid, time-dependent simulation\nwhich employs a modified finite-difference MacCormack scheme to solve the two-fluid\nconservation equations, and a modified Jacobi method to solve the electromagnetic equations for a\nself-field MPD thruster. A real gas equation of state is used, and Hall effects are included. The\nmodel is being modified to incorporate a nonequilibrium ionization model developed by Randolph\n\n14\n\n[4]. Plume regions are not modeled at present, and viscous effects are neglected. Both classical\nand anomalous transport coefficients can be modeled to determine the effects of anomalous\ntransport on thruster performance. Preliminary results [3] indicate enhanced turbulent dissipation\nnear the cathode root and tip, and along the anode tip, leading to decreased thruster efficiencies.\nGerwin et al. [5] have modeled the flow of ideal MHD plasmas through magnetic nozzles\nfor a wide range of plasma densities and temperatures, and provide detailed discussions of issues\nrelated to ideal plasma acceleration and detachment from magnetic field lines. Recent modeling\nefforts have focused on adapting the Los Alamos National Laboratory FLX code to simulate MPD\nthruster plasma flows. The FLX code is a single-fluid, time-dependent Eulerian MHD code,\navailable in 2D and 3D versions, incorporating resistivity, viscosity, and Hall effects. The\nsimulation utilizes an unconditionally stable, semi-implicit time advance method, and has been\nextensively used by the LANL plasma theory group for a variety of applications. The FLX\nsimulations are part of an integrated experimental and theoretical effort undertaken at LANL to\naddress the performance and scaling properties of megawatt-class magnetohydrodynamic thrusters.\nA truly predictive MPD thruster model must incorporate electrode effects, and Goodfellow et\nal. [6] are developing a cathode model which may be used in conjunction with MPD thruster flow\nmodels. The model consists of a thermal model of the cathode and a near-cathode plasma model,\nwhich connects the properties of the main plasma flow with the cathode. A preliminary 1-D,\nself-field version of the cathode model has been completed, and good agreement has been obtained\nbetween predicted cathode temperature distributions and experimental measurements performed at\nthe University of Stuttgart [6]. Work is now progressing on a more extensive, computationally\nfaster model, and efforts are underway to develop a similar model to describe anode processes.\nMartinez-Sanchez [7] has analyzed self-field accelerated flows in MPD thrusters using a\nquasi-1D approximation, assuming zero axial current and neglecting Hall effects. Analytic\ncalculations of thrust vs. current for the Princeton University half-scale flared anode thruster\nagreed very well with experimental data, and a variety of features relevant to self-field acceleration\nprocesses were identified. Niewood and Martinez-Sanchez [8] have developed a numerical 2D,\naxisymmetric flow model which incorporates separate time dependent equations for ion and neutral\ndensity, ion and neutral momentum, and electron and heavy species temperatures for self-field\nMPD thrusters. The code includes separate ion and neutral viscosity models, electron and heavy\nspecies heat conduction, ion-neutral, ion-electron, and electron-neutral elastic collisions, and the\nHall effect. The model has not yet been used to simulate complex geometries or the plume region.\nThe code is fully debugged, and simulations have been perfonned for a geometry with an anode\nradius of 0.072 m, a cathode radius of 0.052 m, and a mass flow rate of 4 g/s for discharge\ncurrents below 30 kA. The model incorporates classical plasma transport coefficients. A previous\none-dimensional version of the code was used to investigate the presence of electrothermal\ninstabilities and to evaluate the effects of anomalous transport induced by modified two-stream\ninstabilities [9]. The present two-dimensional model equations include terms for rate controlled\nionization and recombination using a nonequilibrium model developed by Sheppard [10]. In\nrelated work, Sheppard [I I ] is using a 1 D flow model to analyze the initiation of propellant\nionization ("ignition") at the inlet region of self-field MPD thrusters. Both back diffusion of\nion/electron pairs and photoexcitation/photoionization are considered as candidate mechanisms for\nignition. The multi-level plasma model employs a two-temperature, two-speed (electron/ion slip\nspeed and a single neutral slip speed) approximation. Preliminary models incorporating constant\nspeed approximations are completed, and the full accelerating model is currently under\ndevelopment.\nLaPointe [ 12] has developed a steady state self-field MPD thruster model based on the\n\n15\n\n2-1/21), two-temperature, single-fluid MHD equations. The simulation incorporates classical\ntransport coefficients and Hall effects, but currently assumes full propellant ionization. The\ncoupled equations are solved using a generalized Newton-Raphson iteration scheme on a fixed\ncomputational grid (50 radial x 100 axial grid points). The plume region is included in the\nsimulation. Good agreement has been obtained between predicted and experimental thrust values\nfor straight cylindrical and flared anode geometries. As with other flow models, the magnitude of\nthe discharge voltage is underpredicted, but voltage-current trends are reproduced. Electrode\nmodels must be incorporated into the flow simulations to obtain accurate predictions of discharge\nvoltages and thruster efficiencies. Results of the MHD simulation have been used to develop a\ncriteria for stable self-field thruster operation over a limited range of cylindrical thruster geometries\nand operating conditions. Efforts are underway to include nonequilibrium ionization and\ndissociation processes in the model. An applied-field version of the code is under development.\nAn existing MHD code with the capability to simulate both self-field and applied magnetic\nfield effects is being adapted by Turchi, Roderick, and Mikellides for the study of MPD thrusters\n[ 13]. The MACH2 code was initially developed to support experimental efforts in the Air Force\nSHIVA radiation source program, and has since been used with great success on a wide variety of\nplasma problems. MACH2 is a 2-1/21), single fluid, multi-temperature, nonideal radiation MHD\ncode which can be run for either planar or cylindrical geometries. The single fluid MHD equations\ninclude the continuity equation, the momentum equation in three component vector form, a set of\nenergy equations (depending on the choice of single or multi-temperature), and the magnetic field\ntransport equation. Hall effects, plasma radiation effects (including an option for flux-limited\nnonequilibrium radiation diffusion), and plume expansion regions are included. MACH2 allows\nfor multiple materials and includes models to handle material strength, if required. The equation\nof state and transport coefficients, electron and ion thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity,\nopacities, etc., can be either analytic or tabular, with tabular functions provided by the SESAME\nequation of state library maintained by LANL. MACH2 also provides several microturbulence\nmodels for collision frequency calculations, for use in determining anomalous transport\ncoefficients. The MACH2 code is a time dependent, finite volume spatial differenced ALE\n(Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) code. The Lagrangian hydrodynamic time advance, and the\nthermal, radiation, and magnetic field diffusion are done with implicit time differencing. Implicit\nsolutions are carried out with an SOR (Successive Over Relaxation) algorithm, supplemented with\na multigrid algorithm to accelerate convergence of the diffusion solvers. Recent efforts have been\ndevoted to incorporate time-dependent applied magnetic field boundary conditions into the model,\nand preliminary results have been obtained for relevant MPD thruster geometries. Comparisons\nbetween model predictions and the extensive applied-field MPD thruster data base provided by\nMyers [ 14] are underway.\nAbbreviated List of Modeling Priorities\nThere was general agreement between the committee members on the overall approach\nrequired for successful MPD thruster model development: flow processes, electrode models,\nnonequilibrium ionization models, and instability models, followed by systems studies to evaluate\nthruster performance as a function of geometry, operating conditions, propellant species, etc.\nOpinions varied on the order and importance of the fundamental physics contained in each of these\nareas, but the general pattern which emerged is outlined below. It is expected that this list will be\nsubject to review and revision as the models continue to evolve.\n(1). Plasma Flow Models\n- electrothermal and electromagnetic processes\n\n16\n\n- self-field and/or applied-field models\nModel evolution:\n(a) 2-D continuum flow, axisymmetric geometries, ideal\ngas, classical transport coefficients, Hall effect\n(b) incorporate two temperatures (electron and heavy\nspecies), equilibrium ionization and dissociation\n(c) incorporate electrode models\n(d) include nonequilibrium ionization/dissociation\nmodels, retain classical transport coefficients\n(e) introduce microturbulence, anomalous transport\n(f) other non-local effects (chemical species, etc..)\n(g) develop and integrate non-continuum models\n(2).

Systems Studies\n- variations in thruster geometry\n- injector placement, injector physics\n- propellant species effects\n- heat transfer in materials\n- facility effects\nThe successful development of any MPD thruster model requires the frequent validation of\nsuch codes with other models and with experimental results. Though not specifically listed,\nfostering and maintaining a dialogue between members of the MPD thruster modeling community\nand our experimental colleagues is recognized as a continuing priority.\nStandard Thruster Geometries and Operating Conditions for Code Comparisons\nAs noted previously, there was unanimous agreement between the committee members on\nthe need to compare the existing numerical models with one another and with experimental results,\nusing a set of standard thruster geometries and operating conditions. Members felt that both\n\n17\n\ncylindrical and flared geometries should be modeled over a wide range of\noperating conditions in order to better evaluate the range of validity for each\nmodel. Balancing this was the need to be as unobtrusive as possible with existing research\nschedules. After discussion, the following set of geometries and operating conditions were agreed\nupon:\nSelf-Field Thrusters:\n(1). Princeton University extended anode thruster (Fig. l) [ 151\nRa = 3.2 cm, Re = 0.95 cm, La=21.6 cm, Lc=20.0 cm\nArgon propellant, 50:50 backplate injection\n(a) m = 6 g/s, J = 10,000 A (J2 /m = 16.7 kA -s/g)\n(b) m = 6 g/s, J = 20,000 A (J 2 /m = 66.7 kA -s/g)\n(2). Princeton U. half-scale flared anode thruster (Fig. 2) [ 16]\nArgon propellant, 50:50 backplate injection\n(a) m = 3 g/s, J = 7,900 A (J2 /m = 20.8 kA -s/g)\n(b) m = 3 g/s, J = 17,800 A (J 2/m = 105.6 kA -s/g)\nThis set of self-field geometries and operating conditions provides for both a simple\ncylindrical geometry (set 1) and a fairly simple flared geometry (set 2), with both geometries\nevaluated over a range of specific impulse values. Further details of the geometries, operating\nconditions, and experimental measurements may be found in the referenced papers.\nApplied Field Thrusters:\n(1). NASA LeRC 2" diameter cylindrical thruster [17]\nRa=2.5 cm, Re=0.64 cm, La=7.6cm, Lc=7.6cm\n(a) m = 0.025 g/s (Ar), J = 750 A, B = 0.05 T (cathode tip)\n(b) m = 0.025 g/s (H 2 ), J = 750 A, B = 0.05 T (cathode tip)\n(2). NASA LeRC 4" diameter cylindrical thruster [ 17]\nRa=5.1 cm, Rc= 1.27 cm, La=7.6cm, Lc=7.6cm\n(a) m = 0.1 g/s (Ar), J = 1,000 A, B = 0.05 T (cathode tip)\n(b) m = 0.1 g/s (Ar), J = 1,000 A, B = 0.10 T (cathode tip)\nThe first set of applied-field simulations allows a comparison using different propellants\nunder similar operating conditions, while the second set allows a prediction of the effect of\nchanging the magnetic field strength for otherwise similar discharge parameters. The magnetic\nfield value is given at the cathode tip in each case. For those interested in performing the\napplied-field simulations, a simple numerical routine which predicts the field components for the\nsolenoid magnets used in the NASA LeRC tests is available (contact Myers or LaPointe).\nResults of the modeling efforts will be presented at the 3rd MPD Thruster Workshop at\nLeRC, at a date to be determined.\nReferences\n[ 1].

Diagnostics Committee\nChairman: Dennis Tilley\nMembers/Contributors:\nE. Choueiri, A. Gallimore, A. Kelly, R. Mayo, R. Myers, J. Polk, T. Randolph, J.\nScheuer, K. Schoenberg, P. Turchi, T. York\nThere was consensus among diagnostics committee members that the diagnostics\ncommittee should act as a support group for the other committees (anode, cathode,\nflow, and modeling). In particular, the diagnostics committee will identify experimental\napproaches for the measurement of those quantities identified by the other committees. In this\nreport the list of important quantities to be measured (measurement objectives) and approaches for\ntheir measurement are listed in a table format.\nThe list of measurement objectives was split into the five tables listed below:\nTable 1:\nTable 2:\nTable 3:\nTable 4:\nTable 5:\n\nPerformance Measurements\nCathode Phenomenon\nAnode Phenomenon\nMicroturbulence Phenomenon\nFlow Phenomenon\n\nFor each measurement objective, various diagnostic techniques are tabulated. The list of\ntechniques is not meant to be exhaustive, but is limited to those used or proposed for use in MPD\nthrusters. In addition, for each measurement technique, the following are tabulated: the\nadvantages and disadvantages of the technique, measurement issues, a point of\ncontact, and references. Addresses and phone numbers of the contact points are\ngiven below. The advantages and disadvantages of the technique are listed to allow for\ncomparison of different techniques used to measure a particular quantity (as applied to the MPD\nthruster). Measurement issues include matters that the experimenter must consider when applying\nthe technique to the MPD thruster, although issues that have yet to be satisfactorily resolved are\nalso listed. In general, those issues which have yet to be resolved loom over all experimental\nresults obtained using the diagnostic technique. The point of contact is a person whom\nhas previously applied the diagnostic technique to a MPD thruster. Although there\nare many experts in Japan, Europe, and the former Soviet Union who have applied the diagnostic\ntechniques listed below to the MPD thruster, the list is limited only to those researchers in the\nUnited States. The references provide information on past experience in applying a diagnostic\ntechnique to the unique MPD thruster environment. References 1 - 5 are general plasma\ndiagnostics references. They are not included in the tables. Finally, many boxes in the tables are\nblank due to lack of information. This is mainly due to the fact that the diagnostic has yet to be\napplied to the MPD thruster.\nIt is hoped that these tables will serve as a guide to experimentalists by identifying those\nquantities of interest to modelers, by accelerating the identification of new diagnostics for use in the\nMPD thruster, and thus lead to further the improvement of diagnostic techniques commonly used\nin the MPD thruster.\n\n21\n\nDiagnosts Contacts:\nName\nRod Burton\nEdgar Choueiri\nKevin Diamant\nAlec Gallimore\nAndy Hoskins\nTom Haag\nArnold Kelly\nMans Mantenieks\nRobert Mayo\nRoger Myers\nJay Polk\nTom Randolph\nJay Scheuer\nDennis Tilley\nPeter Turchi\nGlen Wurden\n\nOrganization\nUniv. of Illinois\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton University\nUniv. of Michigan\nRocket Research Co.\nNASA Lewis Res.

Summary of Presentations, Discussions, and Program Directions\nTransportation and Platforms Program Perspectives\nDr. Gary Bennett\nThe NASA OAST mission is to provide for future civil space missions and provide a base\nof research and technology capabilities to serve all national space goals. This means that there\nshould be a clear connection between technology development efforts and\npotential applications. The NASA Flight programs Forecast includes:\n5 year: Focus on Space Station Freedom (SSF) and initial SEI Architecture, evolving\nGEO comsats;\n10 year: SSF evolution, initial SEI/lunar outpost start;\n20 year: SSF - Mars evolution, Mars SEI architecture chosen, large GEO comsats\nThese mission forecasts imply a variety of technology requirements. For instance, the Office of\nSpace Science and Applications (OSSA) has placed 50-100 kW nuclear electric ion\npropulsion technology into its far-term high priority list. No other office has done this\nfor NEP. It is clear that we must find advocates in the mission organizations if we are\nto maintain support for high power electric propulsion. This can be done in the context\nof transportation technology or space platforms technology within OAST. It is also important to\nconsider the space technology budget planning cycle when advocating programs. Details are\nprovided in Appendix C.1.\n\nLow Thrust Propulsion Program Objectives\nDr. Frank Curran\nThe Base Research and Technology program has been perceived as having a "sandbox"\nmentality in which various programs are continued for many years without rigorous review and\nassessment of their degree of success. The new organization at NASA HQ is attempting to address\nthis issue by ensuring that all ongoing efforts have an established, logical path connecting\nthe research with its eventual application. We must show measurable progress\ntoward realistic goals. While this does not mean that we must produce an operational system\ntomorrow, we must establish a logical path by which we can quickly establish the viability of the\nconcept on a timely basis. In addition, the scarcity of resources dictates that the community\nmust work together toward the development of high performance MPD thruster\ntechnology.\n\n"Near Term" NEP Missions and Systems\nMr. James Gilland, Sverdrup Technology, Nuclear Propulsion Office, NASA URC\nNASA\'s Office of Space Science and Applications has identified NEP as first priority on its\nfar term technology needs list to OAST. OSSA is interested in 50 - 100 kWe systems with Isp >\n5000 seconds and efficiencies > 50%. The system specific mass must be less than 50 kg/kW.\n"Near term" means using SP-100 reactor with 7 year life and thermoelectric power conversion,\nwith follow-on development of low temperature Brayton and Rankine cycle conversion\n\n34\n\ntechnology. Possibility of using pulsed thrusters has not been adequately assessed from a system\nlevel given the recent advances in pulsed power technology.\nNEP demonstration missions are restricted to power levels of less than 100 kWe, and\ninclude LEO-GEO transfer missions, Lunar science missions, Mars precursor missions, and\ninterplanetary robotic missions. The presentation focused on the LEO-GEO and\ninterplanetary robotic missions, though most of the latter require specific\nimpulses > 7000 seconds which may be a problem for MPD thrusters. It is clear that\nnear term missions push the technology toward higher efficiency and specific impulse and lower\npower level. Mission analyses were presented for Mars cargo missions for a two system specific\nmasses and a wide range of thruster performance characteristics. While the assumed power level\nwas 1500 kWe and the payload masses were over 50 metric tons, results for nearer term systems\ncan estimated by scaling power and payload mass linearly. In other words, a 5 ton payload would\nrequire 150 kWe for the same Isp, efficiency, and trip time. The results show that for Mars\ncargo missions optimal specific impulses are between 2000 and 6000 seconds.\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nMr. Jay Polk\nThe presentation focussed on engine lifetime assessment, lithium MPD thruster\ndevelopment and the results of some radiation cooled applied-field MPD thruster testing. There is\ncurrently considerable uncertainty in the required engine life, failure modes, and what the statistical\ndistributions of the life-limiting parameters are. It is apparent that engine lifetime is inherently\nprobabalistic, and ultimately this must be accounted for in all analyses. JPL is currently pursuing\nthe first step in this process, that of establishing a theoretical model of cathode phenomena. This\nwill eventually be used to predict cathode mass loss. Erosion models must include melting,\nchemical attack, evaporation, and sputtering as potential causes for cathode degradation.\nComparison of the erosion model results with experimental data from Stuttgart indicates the need to\nmore accurately account for the transport of cathode material in the boundary layer. A thermal\nmodel is currently under development, and has been coupled to a model for the near cathode\nplasma. Models which will predict the cathode work function are under development. Preliminary\nresults using a constant work function and fall voltage show good agreement with measured\ntemperature distributions from Stuttgart.\nJPL has also invested in a cathode test facility which will be used to obtain material and\nplasma property measurements under carefully controlled discharge conditions. In addition, the\nfacility will be used to conduct extended endurance tests.\nAnode studies are focussed on the engineering tasks of modeling heat transfer in anodes\nand exploring methods of heat rejection. Currently developing an electrostatic sheath model and\nare examining the effect of anode work function on heat transfer rates. The primary goal of the\nmodeling effort is to provide appropriate boundary conditions for the thermal models. No work is\ncurrently planned to study magnetic field effects, and there is considerable interest in collaborating\nwith others who are.\nLithium MPD thrusters are also being studied at JPL. A lithium propellant feed system has\nbeen designed and is currently under construction. The thruster test facility design is nearing\ncompletion, and construction is expected to be complete in FY93. Initial testing will focus on 100\nkWe-class radiation-cooled engines.\nResults of testing with ammonia propellant were presented, including a preliminary study\nof the influence of a diffuser on tank pressure and thrust measurements. The diffuser was found to\n\n35\n\ndecrease the tank pressure, though pressure levels were still over 10 millitorr. Thrust\nmeasurements were taken on the applied-field magnet and archead independently, and it was found\nthat the applied-field magnet thrust did not vary as a function of thruster power, whereas the\narchead thrust increased linearly. These phenomena are not currently understood.\n\nLewis Research Center\nDr. Roger Myers\nThe in-house LeRC MPD thruster program is currently focused on evaluating steady-state\n100 kW class applied-field MPD thrusters using a combined experimental and modeling approach.\nThe large vacuum facilities permit steady-state testing of inert gas and hydrogenic propellants at\nambient pressures low enough to preclude any adverse effects on thruster performance or power\ndistribution. Diagnostics currently include direct performance measurements, electrode power\nloss, plume properties, anode plasma properties, and cathode surface temperature. In addition, a\nsmall facility has been built for fundamental electrode physics studies.\nIn the past year a new 100 kW class MPD thruster test facility was established in LeRC\'s\nTank 5 which is devoted to thermal and flow efficiency optimization and lifetime studies. The\nfacility incorporates helium cryopanels which increase the argon pumping speed by a factor of 4,\nand will in the near future be used with liquid helium to pump hydrogen.\nPerformance measurements taken in Tank 6 were used to establish thruster scaling laws for\ncylindrical applied-field MPD thrusters. A large number of geometries were tested across a broad\nrange of operating conditions and the influence of electrode size, propellant flow rate, applied-field\nstrength, and discharge current were quantified. The data showed that while the anode electrode\nlosses decreased as the thruster size was increased, the plasma losses increased, which resulted in\ngenerally similar overall efficiencies for the different thrusters. It is clear that the physics\ncontrolling anode power deposition and plasma flow losses must be isolated to permit overall\nthruster optimization. Studies of the anode power deposition indicate that the anode fall region is\nmagnetized, with fall voltages increasing with both applied-field strength and anode radius and\ndecreasing with increasing propellant flow rate.\nThe dominance of the anode loss has led to the adoption of several approaches to studying\nit and mitigating its impact. A thruster was built which permits near surface plasma property\nmeasurements. This involves both imbedding probes in the anode wall, flush with the surface, to\nobtain electron temperature and density measurements, and attaching pressure transducers to holes\nin the anode. In addition to the thruster studies, a bench-top experiment was established for\nfundamental studies of anode power deposition. Variables examined in this work include the arc\npressure, current density, anode surface magnetic field, and anode work function. Results are\nsimilar to those obtained in thruster tests, with the anode power and fall voltage increasing with\napplied-field strength and decreasing with increasing arc pressure.\nSignificant progress has been made with the MHD modeling of the MPD thruster plasma.\nThe LcRC code is now two-temperature, and has been used to study geometric scaling in self-field\nMPD thrusters. It is restricted to fully ionized argon propellant. The code predicts thrust well, but\nunderpredicts discharge voltage due to its neglect of the fall voltages. A series of numerical\nexperiments were performed to examine the effect of electrode length and radius on thruster\nperformance and stability. The highest calculated performance was 1400 s specific impulse at\n76% flow efficiency (not including electrode losses). Note this specific impulse is still too low to\nbe of interest for most missions. A quantitative scaling rule for thruster stability was developed.\nFor the cases tested, the predicted stable operating range agreed with experimental observations.\n\n36\n\nMPD thruster lifetime studies at LeRC are currently focussed on evaluating alternative\ncathode concepts, extensive thermal mapping of the thrusters, and measurements of the cathode\nsurface temperatures and the internal plasma properties of hollow cathodes. The latter is being\ndone with Ohio State Univ. Several high current hollow cathodes have been tested, and a large\nnumber of surface temperature measurements have been obtained with a variety of thrusters over a\nrange of operating conditions. In addition, a design has been completed for an internally heated,\nlow work function pulsed cathode which may eliminate the lifetime limitations of pulsed MPD\nthrusters.\nA lithium test facility has been designed which will permit performance measurements of\nradiation-cooled, 100 kWe class, applied-field MPD thrusters. Testing should begin in 1993. The\nfacility is large enough to permit studies of plume contamination issues.\nIn the next year, thruster performance studies focus on increasing the thruster power to\n350 kW, studying the effect of anode and applied-field shape on anode power deposition, and\nevaluating the performance of 20 - 50 kWe lithium MPD thrusters. In addition, the MHD model\nwill be improved by adding ionization effects, applied-magnetic fields, and anomalous transport.\nThe latter will be done using the models proposed by Princeton. Lifetime studies include an\nextended test at 100 kWe, improvements in the cathode surface temperature diagnostic, and greatly\nexpanding the data base of fundamental cathode surface and plasma property measurements. In\naddition, a joint program with Princeton will be initiated to evaluate long-life pulsed cathode\ntechnology.\n\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\nDr. Richard Gerwin\nLANL has tested a large scale cylindrical applied-field plasma thruster at power levels\nbetween 10 and 50 MW. Their emphasis has been on examining the scaling implications of the\nideal MHD equations to establish regimes where dissipation does not dominate. The experimental\nwork has been devoted to establishing an overall power balance for their plasma thruster. This has\nincluded development of an imaging technique for anode power deposition measurements, and\ndevelopment of models for plasma separation from the applied magnetic field. Results indicate that\nthere is an economy of scale associated with the ideal MHD formulation, and that the ratio of the\ndischarge current to the number of injected charges (the electrical effort) is a key parameter. The\nlimits on values of the electrical effort can be used to establish an approach to development of a\nhigh efficiency plasma thruster.\nIn their experimental work, the LANL group has taken advantage of an existing experiment\nto diagnose the plasma acceleration processes. No attempt was made to optimize the thruster.\nResults showed that the plasma was accelerated to the magnetosonic velocity, that the magnetic\nReynolds number was \xe2\x80\x94 1000, and that the electrical effort was approximately 0.5. Remarkable\nagreement with ideal MHD flow predictions was observed over a wide range of accelerator size\nand power level. This latter result, which encompasses devices from 2 cm in radius to 24 em in\nradius, implies that exhaust velocity scaling may not be very complex. Results of electrode power\ndeposition studies indicate that the magnetic field geometry plays a fundamental role in the\nestablishing the magnitude and sign of the anode fall voltages. A reversal of the fall voltage was\nobserved during the discharge when the magnetic field transitions from directly connecting the\nanode and cathode to when they connect the cathode to the tank wall. The radiated power\nmeasurements indicate that plasma radiation leads to relatively small performance losses (less than\n\n37\n\n10%).\nFuture work includes extending the pulse length to 10 milliseconds at 10 MW with mass\nflow rate control. In addition, the thruster will be completely isolated from the tank, and the\nmeasurements reported here repeated.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nDr. Daniel Hastings\nThe MTT Space Power and Propulsion Laboratory has several students developing\nnumerical simulations of various aspects of MPD thruster flows. These currently include 2-1) flow\nmodels, boundary layer analysis, and a study of arc ignition in the thruster inlet region. Progress\nin the past year include expanding the codes to include an axisymmetric formulation, a magnified\nanode layer, and heavy species heat conduction. In addition new nonequilibrium ionization and\nviscosity models have been developed which is based on the Bates-Kingston-McWhirter\nformulation. The new viscosity model allows for the presence of substantial slip between the\nplasma and electrode wall, and leads to low ionization fractions near the electrodes. The detailed\nanode region study has revealed that the Hall effect can lead to substantial skewing of the current\nlines and density depletion in the anode region, which may be responsible for the large anode\nvoltage drops. These phenomena may also explain the sensitivity of anode losses to tank\npressure, which would modify the Hall parameter near the anode surface.\nThe inlet ionization model has been developed to establish the mechanisms by which an\ninitial electron density is established near the backplate. Current emphasis is on evaluating back\ndiffusion of electron-ion pairs and radiation from the downstream plasma. The importance of the\nwork is derived from the potential limitations on propellant injection speed: if the particle residence\ntime is too short, then insufficient ionization will take place and the arc will not be sustained.\nFuture work at MIT will focus on improving the near-anode plasma model and obtain\nsolutions for a variety of thruster geometries. The model will be used to establish configurations in\nwhich the anode fall voltage drop is decreased. The inlet ionization work will be extended to\ninclude the role of inlet acceleration, radiation, and emission of cathode electrons.\n\nOhio State University\nDr. Peter J. Turchi and Dr. Tom York\nMPD thruster research at The Ohio State University has focussed on using a small vacuum\nfacility and pulsed power system to study magnetic nozzle flows, code development for hollow\ncathodes and applied field MPD thrusters, and the installation of an extremely high power capacitor\nbank. In addition, considerable effort has been devoted to developing non-invasive laser-based\ndiagnostics for flow-field studies.\nThe magnetic nozzle studies are currently using emission spectroscopy to obtain chordal\naverages of the flow properties, including species distributions, electron temperatures and number\ndensities. The work builds on previous studies using probes and single-point laser scattering\ntechniques. Quantitative results have been obtained which clearly show the plasma confinement\n\n38\n\ndue to the applied magnetic field.\nThe hollow cathode studies are were initiated in an attempt to improve cathode performance\nin MPD thrusters by enhancing the control over the near-cathode plasma. The first-principles\nmodel includes no empirically derived scaling rules, and is cast in terms of the thruster operating\nparameters. The model has been compared with an existing experimental data base for ion thruster\nhollow cathodes and shown good agreement in its predictions of plasma density, temperature, and\nplasma potential. However, those measurements were given as spatial averages and did not\naddress property distribution. For this reason, an experiment has been initiated at NASA LeRC to\nobtained detailed maps of plasma and cathode surface properties as a function of position inside the\ncathode. In addition, work has commenced on an experimental study of high current MPD\nthruster hollow cathodes.\nThe numerical simulation efforts are devoted to modifying the DOD developed MACH2\ncode for application to applied-field MPD thrusters. Improvements in code since last year include\nthe availability of a two-temperature equation of state and incorporation of steady-state poloidal\nfields. Preliminary results indicate that the a pplication of an external ma g netic tad dramatically\nhanges the nature of the thruster flow field.\n\nOLAC/Phillips Laboratory\nMr. Dennis Tilley\nThe Air Force Phillips Laboratory currently has a fully operational quasi-steady MPD\nthruster test facility at the Electric Propulsion Laboratory at Edwards AFB. The MPD thrusters are\ntested in a quasi-steady mode in a steel test chamber measuring 8 ft. in diameter by 10 ft. long.\nThe test chamber is pumped by two 10 diffusion pumps (backed by a mechanical pump and roots\nblower) allowing for the chamber pressure to be in the low 10-4 torr range before thruster firing.\nA 20 kJ pulse forming network is capable of delivering --10 MW of power over \xe2\x80\x94 1 msec to the\nMPD thruster. The primary diagnostic techniques currently in use include Langmuir and magnetic\nfield probes and emission spectroscopy. Advanced diagnostics utilized by the EP Lab\'s arcjet\nresearch program, such as LIF techniques, are also available.\nThe primary emphasis of the MPD thruster research program at the A.F. Phillips\nLaboratory is to identify methods to significantly increase the efficiency of the MPD thruster.\nProjects currently in progress include the investigation of ionization processes, anode losses, and\nthe effects of microturbulence on MPD thruster performance.\nIn the past year a quadruple probe diagnostic technique for simultaneous density,\ntemperature, and velocity measurements was used to study the MPD thruster exhaust. This was\ndone in collaboration with R. Burton at U. of Illinois. The design of a hollow/porous anode MPD\nthruster, in collaboration with A. Gallimore of U. of Michigan, has been completed which will\nhopefully lead a significant decrease in the anode losses of these devices. Over the next year,\ncollaborative efforts with MIT and Purdue University will examine ionization fronts and\nmicroturbulence inside the MPD thruster chamber._ A principal strength of the Phillips Laboratory\nprogram is the close collaboration with university efforts.\n\n39\n\nPrinceton University\nDr. Robert Jahn and Dr. Edgar Choueiri\nOver the past year work at Princeton has been emphasized studies of anode power\ndeposition, the effects of anomalous transport, and the potential application of lithiated cathodes to\nimproving MPD thruster lifetime. Key results of this years efforts include establishing the scaling\nof anomalous resistivity Hall parameter, the impact of anomalous resistivity on the anode voltage\ndrop, the observation of microturbulence in the anode region, and the development of a numerical\nMHD simulation including the effects of anomalous resistivity. In addition, the use of small\npermanent magnets near the anode was shown to decrease the anode fall voltage, and the\nperformance of a thruster with these magnet was measured.\nNumerical studies of anomalous transport showed that the anomalous resistivity could\nexceed classical values by factors between 10 and 30 for conditions expected inside MPD\nthrusters. Inclusion of anomalous resistivity in a 2-D, axisymmetric, 2-temperature MHD\nsimulation revealed that regions of high resistivity were concentrated near the cathode base,\ncathode tip, and anode lip. Improved numerical methods are being implemented to increase\ncomputational speed and accuracy.\nFollowing the establishment of the correlation between electron Hall parameter and the\nanode fall voltage, an experiment was conducted in which small permanent magnets were used to\nlocally decrease the magnetic field. Measurements revealed a substantial decrease in the anode fall\nvoltage for discharge current levels corresponding to approximate cancellation of the self-induced\nmagnetic field. However, the total discharge voltage did not change significantly, and thrust\nmeasurements revealed no significant performance enhancement resulting from use of permanent\nmagnets. However, testing still needs to be done under conditions of maximum decrease in the fall\nvoltage. Experimental studies have also revealed that the plasma resistivity near the anode is\nsubstantially higher than classical values, and high-frequency floating potential measurements\nindicate the presence of micro-turbulence near the anode surface.\nModifications have been made to the steady-state thruster which now permit internal\nspectroscopic studies of the discharge plasma. Results indicate the presence of an ionization front,\nwhich is consistent with the presence of microinstabilities in the thruster. The instability studies\nare also being applied to orbital release experiments being conducted in cooperation with the\nRussian APEX experiment.\nStudies of cathode lifetime are currently focussed on the use of lithium to form an\nelectropositive layer on the cathode surface so as to reduce its work function. At present the work\nhas resulted in an improved surface temperature measurement system.\n\n40\n\n\t\n\nTRANSPORTATION AND PLATFORMS PERSPECTIVE\nGary L.

( 4 2 _ j2 /m).\n* It was speculated that these micro-instabilities might play an\nimportant role in frozen flow and anode losses.\nCATHODE:\n\n(Polk, Chamberlain )\nEvaporation is the dominant mechanism for cathode\nerosion.\n* Low work-function cathode can decrease the cathode erosion\nrate by orders of magnitude.\n\n142\n\nSummary of this Year\'s Activities &\nFindings\n(Details and supporting data are on the following viewgraphs)\n\n* The scaling of anomalous resistivity with the Hall parameter.\n\n(Choueiri )\n* The relation between anomalous resistivity and the anode drop.\n\n(Gallimore, Diamant )\n* The presence of micro-turbulence in the anode region.\n\n(Diamant )\n* Numerical simulations with anomalous transport.\n\n(Caldo, Wunsch, Choueiri )\n* The use of magnets to reduce anode dissipation.\n\n(Gallimore )\n* Performance testing with the new anode.\n\n(Kniker, Braugner )\n* The mechanisms behind the ionization sink.\n\n(Randolph, Kantsiper, Choueiri )\n* Lithiated cathode research.\n\n(Fillmore )\n\n143\n\nPrevious and Current Understandins\n\nThe energy invested in ionization and the anode region\ndissipation (especially at low power) seem to be the most\nimportant causes of inefficiency for the MPD thruster.\nConsequently we have an on-going research program for each of\nthese two problems.\nLast Year\nExistence of Microinstabilities: Last year we only had speculations on\nthe nature of the dissipative mechanisms controlling the importance of\nthese two sinks. There was theoretical evidence from Choueiri on the\npresence and importance of LHCDI in the MPD thruster plasma as well as\nexperimental support for the existence and resilience of such\nmicro instabilities from Tilley and Choueiri for both kW and MW level\ndevices.\nThe scaling of Va with the Hall parameter : Gallimore undertook\nextensive measurements of the anode drop and re-established the strong\ndependence of the anode drop on the electron Hall parameter. No solid link\nexisted at that time between the anode drop and the role of\nmicroinstabilities.\nRecent developments\nThe scaling of anomalous resistivity with the Hall parameter:\nSince then, Choueiri added many real effects to his model of\nmicro instabilities and carried the theory into the nonlinear phase to study\nthe impact of such instabilities on the basic transport processes in the\nplasma through the induced microturbulence. One of the major findings of\nthat study is the strong dependence of the anomalous resistivity on the\nelectron Hall parameter. This led to the speculation that the anode drop\nmay be due to the turbulence-induced anomalous resistivity.\nThe relation between anomalous resistivity and the anode drop:\nShortly thereafter, Diamant and to a larger extent Gallimore inferred the\nlocal resistivity near the anode from experimental measurements and found\nit to be up to an order of magnitude larger than the classical value. This\nhas considerably strengthened the link between the anode drop and plasma\nturbulence.\n144\n\nThe presence of turbulence in the anode region: To further\ninvestigate this possible link, Diamant has undertaken a systematic probing\nof the plasma very near the anode looking for evidence of\nmicroturbulence. His results were positive. Prominent peaks in the\nfluctuating energy spectra are at and very near the frequencies (lower\nhybrid frequency) predicted by the wave stability and microturbulence\ntheories. We are now relatively more confident of our earlier speculations\nconcerning the role of microturbulence in the dissipation.\nNumerical simulation with anomalous transport: In order to study\nthe role of the above phenomena and relate them to the global flow\nproblem Caldo used the anomalous transport models developed by Choueiri\nin a state-of-the-art two-D, two-fluid code to investigate self-consistently\nthe effects of the turbulence on the flow and vice-versa. He found that the\nplasma regions near the cathode\'s tip and root and near the anode tip are\ncritical from the point of view of anomalous transport.\nWunsch has developed a coordinate transformation algorithm that allows\nthe adaptation of the MPD flow code to any axi-symetric geometry.\nChoueiri has implemented specialized compilers for the MPD code on the\nCornell supercomputer that allow an order of magnitude speed up in the\nexecution performance over that previously attainable on that machine.\nThe use of magnets to decrease dissipation: Spurred by the strong\nscaling of the anode drop with the electron Hall parameter, Gallimore\nimplanted a series of small permanent magnets in the anode that were\ndesigned to effectively annul the local magnetic field in the anode region\nthus hopefully decreasing the resistivity and dissipation. While the anode\ndrop seems to have been sensibly decreased the total voltage seemed little\neffected.\nPerformance testing with the new anode: In order to follow up on\nthe possibility of performance improvement with the magnetically annuled\nanode, Kniker and Braugner have just finished a relative efficiency\ncomparison of the new and old anodes using the laboratory\'s thrust stand.\nTheir experiments showed that, unfortunately, the new anode does not\noffer a higher thrust efficiency than the older one.\nThe mechanisms behind the ionization sink: The link between\nplasma microturbulence and excessive ionization is today as speculative as\nwas the link between microturbulence and the anode drop last year. It is\nspeculated from theory that electrons should benefit from the preferential\n\n145\n\nheating of the unstable waves and cause a very efficient ionization through\nthe CIV effect thus tying up a substantial fraction of unrecoverable energy\nin singly, doubly and triply ionized atoms. Such anomalous ionization\nwould typically happen abruptly through spatially well defined ionization\nfronts. The existence of such fronts has not been properly established.\nRandolph has set out to investigate spectroscopically whether such fronts do\nactually exist inside the chamber of the MPD thruster. He found that a\nrapid ionization region possibly exists upstream of his physical viewing\nwindow and has recently succeeded in pushing this region within that\nwindow by advancing the discharge forward through the use of a partly\ninsulated cathode.\nAnother program aimed at the study of the fundamental aspect of the CIV\neffect was initiated recently. Experiments staging a CIV interaction\nthrough the injection of a neutral gas from the Russian APEX satellite have\nbeen undertaken recently and are currently being analyzed by Choueiri.\nHe is currently planning more optimized gas release experiments on APEX\nduring the upcoming months using among other tools, a kinetic stability\nmodel for CIV interactions developed at EPPDyL by Kantsiper.\nLithiated cathode research: Fillmore has finished the calibration and\nthe preparation for his upcoming experiments on the use of a lithiated\ncathode for the control of cathode erosion rates. Lithiated cathodes are\nexpected to yield orders of magnitude reduction in the erosion rate, thus\neventually relegating the cathode erosion problem to the arena of\ndevelopment engineering as an essentially resolved fundamental problem.\n\n146\n\nr30\n\n1\t\n\nArgon\n\nP e= 1\n\n25\n\nUde/U ti\n\n=10\n\n20\n3\na\t\n\n15\n\nf\n\n1\t\n\n5\n\n\xc2\xa3\t\n\n0\n\n2\t\n\n4\t\n\n10\n\n8\t\n\n6\t\n\nElectron Hall Parameter,\n\ne\n\nAnode Power Deposition in MPD Thrusters\nInsulator\n- Thruster Electrodes\n\n4o\n\nb\n\nargon\n\n30\n\n2\n\nb\nFX\n\n10\n\nStudy\n\n#?\nPropellant\nInjection\'\t\n\nNRegion of\n\n20\n\nO\n\n0\n\ny\n\n0\t\n\nX511\n\n20\t\n\n40\t\n\nCiO\t\n\n80\t\n\nJ2/m (kA 2 - s/0,\n\n:4\n\nInferred Electrical Conductivity\n147\n\n100\t\n\n120\t\n\n140\n\n10\n\nI\t\n\n0.001\n\nI\n\n1\nI\t\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\t\n\n0\t\n\n4\n\n3\t\n\n2\t\n\n5x106\n\nFrequency (Hz)\nFigure 1.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nThe Second Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) Thruster Workshop was held at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Lewis Research Center on May 19, 1992. There were 32 participants, including experts from NASA, the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE), the Department of Defense (DOD), and academia. Six government laboratories and six\nuniversities were represented at the workshop, the purpose of which was to review technical progress made since the last\nmeeting held at NASA Headquarters in 1991 and discuss plans for future work. Specifically, the meeting focussed on\nprogress made in establishing performance and lifetime expectations of MPD thrusters as functions of power, propellant,\nand design; models for the plasma flow and electrode components; viability and transportability of quasi-steady thruster\ntesting; engineering requirements for high power, long life thrusters; and facilities and their requirements for performance\nand life testing.\n\n15.
