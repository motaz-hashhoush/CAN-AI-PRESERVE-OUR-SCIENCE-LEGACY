The Psyche mission will determine if (16) Psyche is the core of a larger differentiated body. As part of the development of this mission a Verification and Validation (V&V) engineer was assigned early in the project\u2019s design Phase B. This paper will discuss some of the strategies that the Psyche team is using to take full advantage of the early planning for V&V on flight projects and specifically how the Psyche mission is approaching these tasks. This paper will discuss the effects of having a V&V mindset on:  1) The Psyche requirements development process, and how focusing not only on how the team will verify these requirements but also on developing the tools necessary to track and monitor that verification feeds back into the requirement development process.  2) The Psyche testbed development, and how using a verification mindset is useful for identifying holes in the testbed development process, including the required testbed speed and how to think about testbed certification early in the process while encouraging trades and developing relationships with the testbed team.  3) Developing new V&V Tools for Psyche, and how developing tools early in the project development process means that they can influence the development of other requirement and scheduling tools.  4) Verification Activity Planning, which is typically done to a preliminary level during Phase B of the project, and is important for understanding the major testing that is needed to ensure that the system as built represents the design. On Psyche we are not only focused on bringing this planning to a preliminary level, we are also developing a V&V focused schedule to help us de-conflict V&V activities that may require similar resources early on in the program\u2019s development.  5) Validation Planning, for which we are working with the testbed and model development teams to ensure that their models can be effectively validated and that the plans to do so are in place.  In this paper we will describe how the Psyche mission is approaching each of these V&V areas and identify lessons that can be taken by other space missions trying to decide how much effort should be put into V&V early in the project lifecycle.", "title": "Psyche Early Project Verification & Validation Planning Development", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Solish, Benjamin"}}, "id": "f3beb0c61ece4703a1fab42b26900ae5"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Drain, Tracy"}}, "id": "6605e454a3d8443fa2a73f5384fce61a"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hart, Shirley"}}, "id": "c1eaf2a5134e42a29e5e0f1c5e458321"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hart, William"}}, "id": "ab5ec4faac194cdd810e906e73b41a07"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Geiser, Joshua"}}, "id": "22ca7aa1e85640a3801b84dee066ab39"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lum, Karen"}}, "id": "6701e01ff91d44feaf6d378e68c5288f"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220000809, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oh, David"}}, "id": "78c15ee070d64a36866d3db927f62245"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:44:11.7385950+00:00", "id": 20220000809, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/52301", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220000809, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2019", "id": "b5edec5187d2453dbe2a07bff9d15247", "publicationDate": "2019-03-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
