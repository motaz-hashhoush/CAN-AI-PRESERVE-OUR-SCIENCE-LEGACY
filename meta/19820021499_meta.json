The boracites have the general formula X3B7O3Y, where X = divalent metal and Y = halogen. They undergo a first order phase transition from a high temperature paraelectric phase with cubic symmetry to a ferroelectric phase with orthorhombic symmetry. The boracites are \"improper ferroelectrics\" since the spontaneous polarization is not the primary order parameter in the cubic-orthorhombic phase transition. Current understanding of these materials is that the primary order parameter is associated with a doubly degenerate zone-boundary phonon in the cubic phase. The degenerate critical modes become homogeneous and split into the A sub 1 and A sub 2 modes in the orthorhombic phase, doubling the volume of the primitive cell. An harmonic coupling between the softing A sub 1 and a low frequency A sub 1 optic mode induces a spontaneous polarization as a secondary effect in the ferroelectric phase. This secondary non-critical nature of the ferroelectric mode earns these materials the \"improper\" title and is responsible for their unique properties and high figure of merit in detector use.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820021499, "id": "d25d6986803743088442b115c158fe9e", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19820021499.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19820021499/downloads/19820021499.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19820021499/downloads/19820021499.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19820021499/downloads/19820021499.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
