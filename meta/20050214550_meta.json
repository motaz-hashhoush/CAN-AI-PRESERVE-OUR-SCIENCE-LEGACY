Cancellation of the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) program has had a significant negative impact on resources and research goals. This report highlights advancements and achievements made with this cooperative agreement over the past year. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) continues to make advances in silicon carbide (SiC) research during the past year. Step free surfaces were used as substrates for the deposition of GaN epilayers that yielded very low dislocation densities. Defect free 3C- SiC was successfully nucleated on step free mesas and test diodes were fabricated. Web growth techniques were used to increase the usable surface area of dislocation free SiC by approximately equal to 40%. The greatest advancement has been attained on stepped surfaces of SiC. A metrology standard was developed using high temperature etching techniques titled \"Nanometer Step Height Standard\". This development culminated in being recognized for a 2004 R&D100 award and the process to produce the steps received a NASA Space Act award.", "title": "Silicon Carbide Growth", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050214550, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050214550, "id": "1b8df2d9db044df59461bce69e6ca47f", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050214550.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050214550/downloads/20050214550.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050214550/downloads/20050214550.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050214550/downloads/20050214550.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
