During the final\npreparation, a comparison of the mechanical interface data for the\nexperiments revealed that the WUPPE baffle was five inches shorter than\nthe UIT and HUT baffles.\nThe Image Motion Compensation System (IMCS) ICD was developed\nand submitted for Level II CCB baselining. Three IMCS RIDs are open for\ndata. The WFC ICD was also developed.\nWBS 75.13 integrated Payload Compatibility\nA FDOR/CDR review plan was prepared and coordinated with MSFC.\nThe MPE CDR data package was finalized and submitted for printing.\nIncluded were 24 MPE documents, drawings, the IIAs and the ICDs for\nIMCS.\nAll open action items were closed by memo. All open IDE RIDs\nfor the IIAs and IPRD were incorporated. All DNs generated ag<<inst the\nMPE PDR data package have been incorporated into the design dr,cumentation. The 21 DNs remaining open are in the process of being closed out\nthrough the release of the CDR data package.\nThe Astro-1 POP 84-1 summary was completed and is undf!r review\nprior to incorporation into the PMIC POP 84-1 submiss-lon to MSFC.\n\n8-4\n\nA new change order is being requested to cover fabrication and\nmaterial dollar costs for the Astro-1 MPE program. Some design hours\nare included to corer additional tasks not previously covered. The new\nchange order will be aligned to the Revision D, MPE Development Plan,\ndated January 1984. The MPE Developm\t\n\nphi, contains identification of\n\nMPE hardware, eirctricabl^ cables, GSE, and test equipment. With new\ntasks, a revised listing of items to be built by MSFC and TBE will be\nincorporated. The MPE Development Plan was reprinted the first week in\nJanuary and distributed.\nCritical materials, including long-lead items, are under constant review with procurement actions initiated as required. Items\ncovered during the reporting period include heat pipes for the IRS,\nsilverized tape for the IRS, spherical bearings for alignment hardware,\ntitanium for mounts and the PCA, and fasteners. A new cable connector\nlist was received from MSFC and is being reviewed prior to initiation of\nprocurement.\nA PERT chart was developed for the three main WE flight assemblies; the cruciform, PCA, IRS, and their associated hardware. Critical\npath item tracking showed that the time allotted for fabrication of\nindividual items is adequate. However, in the current schedule, most\nitems are slated to be fabricated during the same time frame producing a\npeak of activity. A study of the schedules is being conducted to determine if fabrication of some items can be delayed or if sequencing the\nfabrication of parts :`or some items w-111 relieve the over burdened fabrication schedule.\nThe epoxy test was performed on epoxy EA 956. The test was\nsuccessful. Further tests are planned to determine the long range\neffects of the epoxy. A report will be submitted by February 1984.\nA trip was made to KSC to participate in the Payload Ground\nOperations Working Group Meeting on December 1-2, 1983. Presentations\nwere made by TBE on the following items: telescope alignment, access\nspacer concepts, IRS integration, PCA alignment, end PCA integration.\nNo problems were uncovered concerning the telescope alignment, IRS\n\n8-5\n\nAt\n\nintegratior, or PCA integration. The access spacer, which was to be\nused to support the integrated cruciform during Level IV testing to\nallow access to the electronics on the IRS, was eliminated and the\ncruciform cradle will be used if access becomes necessary. A detailed\nflow sequence for buildup of the IRS at KSC is prepared and is under\nfinal review. This flow also shows that steps are required to ,lain\naccess to the equipment on the IRS at various points in the integration\nat levels IV/III/II.\nThe remaining drawings for the main alignment hardware were completed. Fabrication of these items is scheduled to begin during January\n1984.\nThe design concept for the thermal gradient sensing system was\ndeveloped and reviewed with MSFC S &F, including test and verification\n\nplans correlated to IRS thermal vacuum tests.\nWeight calculations are being made for the cruciform, PCA, and\nIRS assemblies. Presently 94 percent, 58 percent, and 89 percent of the\nweight for the cruciform, PCA, and IRS, respectively, has beer] calculated. Biweekly reports are being submitted to MSFC. The latest report\n\nshowed the TBE/MPE limit weight to be exceeded by 240 kg.\nThe WFC Test Plan and Verification Plan were consolidated into\n\none document with safety critical items being tracked in the Safety\nHazard Report.\nThe requirements for use of MSFC\'s Payload Development Support\nSystem and EMI testing facility for WFC qualification and acceptance\n\ntesting were submitted.\nAn MUA was reached with MSFC on a chassis with nylon connectors\n\nand silverplated kapton insulated wire for circuit interconnections for\nthe WFC electronic interface unit.\nA cost proposal in response to MSFC\'s C/0 247 final design,\n\nbuild, and test of the WFC was forward(:d December 5, 1983.\nMPE schedules and cost data P.ssociated with each major MPE\ngrouping are provided on the follow \xe2\x80\xa2 ng pages.\n\n8-6\n\nb\n\n^<\n\na\t --\n\nao\n\n=s_\n\nORIGINAL,PA(I_ 19\nOF POOR QUAL\nITY\n\n__\n\n-\n\n-- -\n\nN_\t\n\nb\n\na oo\n\n-r\n\nW\n\nn\nY\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-\n\nCCC7\n> ti\n\ni\n\nJ t j\n\nt\t\n\n1\n\n..\n\ny\n\nWi\n\n< t\n\nW\n\nI--\n\n> r\n^ G Y\n\nW P.-\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nW\n\n^\n\n__ ^ 67\n\nC7\n\nt\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\nH n\n\nN\n\n--Q01 ___ _\t ..\n\nY\nr\t\nW\t\n^^^___?\n\n.J 1^ d\n\nh...\n\nJ\n\nNa\n---\n\n=`\nC\n\n^y vo\n\n=\nu\n\n- r--\n\nLL\n\nd\n\n__\n\nd\n\nW...\n\nV\n\na\n\nto\n\nWW\n\nate_\n\nO\n\nC\n\nS\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nE\n\nN\n\n1j\n\naW\n\n__...\n\nY\n\nWJ\n\nco\n\n<\n\nrb\'` ---\n\n2\n\nIL\n\ni\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x96\xba-\n\nuj\n\n^\n\xe2\x80\x94\nZm\n\nu+ d\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nza\n^\n\nt\n\nL.^\n\n^-\n\nVf d\n\n--\n\n=\nLj\na\n\nA\nr^x\n\nQ=^\n"31f\n`\n\n^ r\nW\n\nN\n\n^\n\n}\n-i\n\nW\n>.\n\nJ\n\n_\n\nW\nLi\n\nN\n\xc2\xa2\n\ny\n\nJ\nC\n\n^\nC\n\n...\n\n_\n6\n\nv\n\nH\n\n`^\n\nZ\n\n_\n\n^\t\n\nW\n\nQ y\n\n\xc2\xb0e\t\n\nC\n\nyy^^^\n\nJ\n\nt^;^ t/f\n\nJ Z\n\nL\n~\nX\n\nyT1\n\nN\n\nZ\n4^\n\nD\n\n8-7\n\n\t\n\n:w\t\n\n-\t\n\n-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2:^. ,\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n-\n\nOF- POOR QUALITY . - -- ---\t -\n\n`\n\nM\n\nN\n\ncc\n\n7\n\nz\ny W\n\nti ti\n\nO\n=\n\n~\n\n\xe2\x96\xbac\nr.\n\nt\n\nt ^\n\nJ\n\nti\n\nW>\n\nH\t\n\n,\xe2\x96\xba\n\nWed N^6CU\t\nW\n\n__\n\nSOS.-\n\nZ\n\nW\n\n-\n\nQ\na\n\nW\n\nJ\n\n_W\n\nJ v\t\n\n",\t\n\nH V~\n\nd\n\nNU\t\n\nJ\n\nJW\n\nLAJ\n\nK\nt\n\nW\n\n-\t __ __-\n\nNN" - -\n\nK\t\n\n-\n\n^ 6 ^\n\nW\t\n\n7\n\nG\n\n_..

PRENISSION DEFINITION\n\nDedicated Discipline Laboratory (DDL) Cost-Effectiveness Study\nThis study authorized by TO-JA02-84-04 has progressed on a\nslower schedule than anticipated both because customer requirements for\ncompletion of the study were underestimated and because of efforts to\nimprove the utility of the results.\nAt customer request, cost analyses were performed on the Earth\nObservation Mission (EOM) and Shuttle Radar Lab (SRL). This brought to\nsix the number of missions analyzed versus the planned four. This was\nonly possible because of the effort made early in the study to install\nthe cost model on the VAX.\nIt became apparent during a late November trip to KSC that the\nresults of the equipment requirements and facility utilization analysis\nwould be much more useful if they were plotted instead of merely listed.\nThe computer model was subsequently modified to accomplish this.\nA three-volume DDL final report is being developed. Volume I is\nan executive summary, Volume II contains details of the cost analysis,\nand Volume III describes the hardware requirements analysis. A preliminary draft of Volume iII has already been delivered while drafts of\nVolumes I and II ari within several days c completion.\nAccommodation Study of LeRC Middeck Payload\nThis study authorized by TD-JA21-83-10 has progressed . well. A\ndraft copy of the Middeck Payload Accommodation Handbook update was submitted to the CDR on December 29, 1983, for review. The comments were\nincorporated and the draft is now ready to be published.\nSpace Plasma Laboratory Preliminary Mission Definition\nThis task authorized by TD-JAII-83-20 was initiated in late\nNovember 1983 and has been coordinated with S&E personnel to avoid\nduplication.\nConfiguration layouts were developed to supplement S&E effort\n(S&E configuration lacked subsystem definition).\n\n9-1\n\n4\n\nr\n\nThermal analyses for SPL and -2 were performed to ascertain\n\nsystem pressure drop and fluid volume requirements. This involved leakage estimate and volume contraction/expansion calculations.\nRMS cable capabilities for RPDP and NASC-201 data transmission\nwere investigated through consultation with\n\nSPAR. Preliminary analyses\n\nsuggest that RMS can probably carry the data requirements in the format\nsuggested by RPDP and NASC-201.\nFurther study is in progress to include STRIP data requirements\nand Middeck accommodation of the DEPs of AEPI, ENAP, and\n\nSEPAC. This\n\ntask was introduced through TD-JA11-84-1 in the second week of January\n1984.\n\n9-2\n\n- _ _---- _\t\nCAP\n\n10. MISSION PECULIAR EQUIPIENT SUPPORT STRUCTURE\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\nWBS 35.1 - Mission Peculiar Equipment (MPE)\nFracture critical inspection of the keel structure on MPESS\nSNs 003 and 004 was completed using the Eddy current method. As\nexpected, no discernible cracks were detected.\n\n10-1\n\nI\n\ny,\n\n4\n\n11. MIDDECK\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\nWBS 35.1 - Mission Peculiar Equipment\nTwo NLS5H24-35PS connectors were shipped to Mr. Don\nWohleber/ET32 on November 18, 1983. Ninety percent of the previously\nordered electrical connectors has been received and is in storage at\nTBE.\nThe Middeck Electronics Module (MEM) fabrication and assembly\nwas completed during this period. The unit was functionally tested,\nboth hardware and software, prior to its shipment to MSFC to be tested\non their vibration table.\nProblems were encountered with the MEM when it was returned to\nTBE for further functional testing. Troubleshooting and faill;re analysis pinpointed the problem to he the read circuitry of the GFE tape\nrecorder. The tape recorder from the GSE unit was installed io the MEM\nfor the follow-on functional testing and integration testing to be conducted by MSFC.\nWBS 75.2 - MPE Design\nThe MEM Software Detailed Design Document was revised to reflect\nthe "as built" configuration. This document is scheduled to be released\nin conjunction with the MEM Acceptance Data Package.\nThe GSE Kaypro software was completed. The operation of the\nKaypro software and the MEM interface unit is presently being documented\nin the GSE Operation and Maintenance Manual, scheduled to be released\nwith the MEM Acceptance Data Package.\nWBS 75.11 - Configuration Change Coordination and Processing\nWe continued to process and track DN closeouts against the ADSF,\nARC, and IEF milestone review data packages and to process change\nrequests submitted by MSFC organizational elements. We published\nreports depicting DN and open change activities on a regular basis.\n\n11-1\n\n'
