Begun in late 1978, the project is devoted chiefly to construction of two replicas of the 1903 Wright 'Flyer'. The first, now being covered, is an exact replica intended for full-scale wind tunnel tests. The second will be a flying replica, incorporating minimal modifications to produce a less unstable aircraft. Considerable attention has been given to the aerodynamics, stability, and control of the 1903 'Flyer'. Wind-tunnel tests have been conducted with a 1/6 flexible model, and a 1/8 scale steel model tested at full-scale Reynolds numbers. The data have provided the basis for analyzing both the closed-loop and open-loop performance of the aircraft. Consideration is also given to aeronautical history both before and after 1903, to provide a better appreciation for the Wrights' achievements and a clearer perspective of their work in the context of aeronautical progress.", "title": "Building a 1903 Wright 'Flyer' - By committee", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T14:35:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880034840, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Culick, F.
