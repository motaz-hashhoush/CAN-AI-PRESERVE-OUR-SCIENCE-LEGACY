For the purpose\nof the present\ndiscussion,\nthe terra "supercomputer\nMwill denote a machine with a performance\ncapability\nof at least class VI\nin accordance\nwith the following classification\ndefined\nby the U.S. Department\nof Energy:\n\nIn this article I will give an overview of supercomputing at Lockheed\nCorporation in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD). This overview\nwill focus on developments\nand applications\nof CFD as an\naircraft design tool and will attempt\nto present an assessment,\nwithin this context, of the state-of-the-art\nin\nCFD methodology.\nAlthough\nCFD is being actively developed\nand applied\nthroughout\nLockheed\nCorporation, the material of this paper draws heavily from activities\nthat have taken place or are underway\nat\nLockheed-California\nCompany.\n\nClass\n\nIII\n\nSustained\noperating\nspeeds between\n2 million floating point operations\nond (megaflops)\n\nClass\n\nIV\n\n2 to 6 megaflops\n\nClass\n\nV\n\n6 to 20 megaflops\n\nClass\n\nVI\n\n20 to 60 megaflops\n\nClass VII\n\nOf course, supercomputing\nin the aerospace\nindustry is not limited to CFD. Many other disciplines\neither\nare already,\nor have the potential\nof, benefiting\nfrom\nsupercomputing:\nstructural\nanalysis and optimization,\nvehicle signature\n(electromagnetic,\nacoustic,\nthermal)\nprediction,\nand signal processing,\nto name the obvious\nones. In other areas, where the supercomputing\nrevolution has not yet made its full impact, the payoffs are\nlikely to be extraordinary.\nOne such area is manufacturing. Supercomputers\nwill make possible the effective\nintegration\nof all phases and aspects of complex manufacturing\nprocesses\nand are bound to become essential\nin the development\nand operation\nof a new generation\nof sophisticated,\nversatile, and _intelligent _ robotic systems.\n\nGreater\n\nthan\n\n0.6 and\nper sec-\n\n60 megaflops\n\nPresently\ntwo supercomputers\nare in operation\nat\nLockheed\nCorporation.\nThe first one, a Cray 1S, was\ninstalled\nat the Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia,\nplant of Lockheed Missiles and Space Company\n(LMSC) in 1982.\nThis supercomputer\nis basically\ndedicated\nto serving\nthe needs of the various LMSC divisions.\nThe second\none, a Cray X-MP/24,\nbecame operational\nat the Kelly\nJohnson\nResearch\nCenter, Rye Canyon,\nCalifornia,\nin\nApril 1986.\nThe Cray X-MP/24\nis a dual processor\nmachine\nwith an in-core memory capacity of 4 million 64-bit\nwords. It is front-ended\nby two Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computers in the Lockheed installation:\na DEC 8600 for unclassified\nprocessing,\nand a DEC\n8300 for classified mode operation.\nThis supercomputer, although it can be accessed remotely from all major\nLockheed divisions, is primarily intended to cater to the\nLockheed Aeronautical\nSystems Group companies.\n\nIn spite of the wide applicability\nof supercomputing, I have chosen to limit my discussion\nto CFD and\nits application\nto aircraft design because of the following factors: 1) time and space constraints;\n2) personal\nbias due to my familiarity\nwith the subject; and 3) CFD\nwas one of the first disciplines\nto push the limits of\n*ordinary Mor "general purpose Hcomputers,\nthus giving\nrise to the need for supercomputer\ncapability.\nMoreover, the practical\nfeasibility\nof CFD application\ndemands supercomputing\npower, and most future developments\nin this area hinge on the availability\nof even\ngreater computer\nspeed and memory capability.\n\nThe principal\nmotivation\nfor the acquisition\nof\nsupercomputer\nhardware was the perceived\nneed for\nprocessing\nspeed.\nThe above\nsupercomputers\nhave\nbeen able to fulfill that need fairly well for most present\napplications.\nAt the same time, they have offered the\npossibility of more advanced computations.\nAs we gain\n\n77\n\nThe ability to meet the above requirements\ntruly\nmoreexperience\nwiththese\ncomputations,\nandaswe\nattemptotackle\nt\nmore\ndemanding\nproblems,\ntheneed differentiate between a research CFD method and one\nfor morecomputer\nmemoryecomes\nb\nacutely vident. that is an engineering and design tool: for design applie\nThisisparticularly\ntruein theengineering\napplicationscations, a CFD method must meet all above requireof CFD.Aswill beindicated\nlateron,theuseof ad- ments with a reasonable degree of completeness.

It is the professional\nresponsibility of the CFD code developer to fully acknowledge\nthis difference\nand make it clear to the non-expert.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nOF\nDESIGN APPLICATIONS\n\nUnfortunately,\nthere is a tendency\namongst\nCFD researchers to greatly underestimate,\nor completely\ndisregard, the important effort of turning a research, or pilot,\ncode into a practical engineering\ntool.\n\nThe paper is mainly concerned with CFD developments and applications\nwithin the context of aircraft\ndesign. Therefore,\nalthough it may appear obvious to\nmany, it is important to emphasize\nthe principal requirements that a CFD code ought to meet if it is to be\nused as an aircraft design tool, namely:\n\n1)\n\nThus, the principal challenge\nposed by design applications\nto CFD practitioners\nis to convert what is\nfeasible in principle (i.e., feasible in a research laboratory environment)\ninto practical engineering\ntools that\nmeet all four requirements\nlisted at the beginning\nof\nthis section.\n\nIt must be a predictive tool, i.e., the accuracy\nand reliability of the computation\nshould not\ndepend on too much fine tuning or tailoring of\ninput parameters. In many advanced applications,\napplicable\nexperimental\ndata are not\navailable to "calibrate _ the results of numerical\n\nSome of the principal CFD codes for aircraft design\napplication\nin use at Lockheed\nare described\nin the\nfollowing\nsections. These codes have been singled out\nfor discussion\nherein on the grounds that they have\nbeen or are being developed\nspecifically\nto be practical\nengineering\ntools. As in most engineering\ndisciplines,\nthere is a hierarchy in CFD methodology,\nnamely, the\nvarious computational\ncodes can be classified according to levels of increasing\ncomplexity\nand accuracy.\nThis also implies different\nrequirements\nin terms of\ncomputational\nresources. The codes to be discussed, all\nof them in practical use at Lockheed,\nspan the CFD\nmethodological\nhierarchy.\n\ncomputations.\n\n2)\n\nIt must be able to handle complex geometric\nconfigurations,\nincluding three-dimensionality,\nintricate aircraft components,\nand complete aircraft arrangements.\n\n3)\n\nIt must yield useful results in a reasonably short\nperiod of time, consistent with usually pressing\nprogram schedules.\n\n4)\n\nIts application,\nalthough it may require a reasonable\ndegree of expertise\nand experience,\nmust not demand specialization\nto a degree that\nonly its developers\ncan effectively\nuse it.\n\nLINEAR\n\nThe above requirements\nare extremely important if\nCFD is to realize its full potential as an effective design\ntool. As has already been pointed out in Reference 1,\nthese requirements\ndirectly relate to the equation:\nEFFECTIVENESS\n\n= QUALITY\n\nCFD METHODOLOGY:\nMETHODS\n\nPANEL\n\nMethods based on linear inviscid flow assumptions\nare more fully developed\nthan nonlinear methods,\nand\nthey are less demanding\nof computer\nresources.\nThe\nmost common linear methods\nare the so called panel\nmethods.\nThe majority of these methods are limited in\nthe flow physics they can model: they cannot deal with\nshock waves, transonic flows, and separated flows. On\nthe other hand, they are capable of modeling\nall geometric features of the vehicle, including\nthe most intricate details. At Lockheed, the advanced low-order panel method\nQUADPAN\nfor subsonic\nand supersonic\nflows is the principal tool for linearized analysis, Figure\n1. It has been under development\nand in use for a\nnumber of years, Reference 2.\n\nX ACCEPTANCE\n\nThis expression\nhas no actual quantitative\nmeaning, it is merely a symbolism to emphasize\nthe axiom\nthat the effect a given process has on the activity for\nwhich it is intended depends not only on the goodness\nof the process itself, but also on how widely it is used\nor accepted. In the present context, the first couple of\nitems listed above impact the quality factor; the last two\nthe acceptance\nfactor.\n\n?8\n\nORIGINAL\n\nPAGE\n\nPOOR\n\nOF\n\nIS\n\nQ_ALIT_.\n(CONSTANT\nSOURCE)\n\nPAN\n\nO_\n\nJfJ\n\nSURFACE\nPLANAR\n\n\'_-\n\nl\nDOUBLET\n\n-\n\n:\n\n\'_\n\n-\n\nability to model complex geometry.\nIt shows a generic\nadvanced fighter configuration\nwith the corresponding\npanels used to model the flow\n--_%,"_ \'-;;ICONS,ANT elemental quadrilateral\nabout it.

Usually these panels are fiat and of a quadrilateral shape. Elementary\nsolutions of the linearized\nflow equation, known as sources and doublets, are assigned to each panel, Figure 2. The individual strengths\nof these elementary\nsolutions\nare determined\nby the\napplication\nof the appropriate\nboundary\nconditions,\ne.g., no flow across solid surfaces. The shape of the\ndistribution\nacross a panel of these elementary\nsolutions determine whether the method is low order (e.g.,\nconstant or linear variation) or high order (e.g., quadratic variation).\n\n\\\nFigure\n\n3.\n\nSurface\npressure\non generic\nfighter\n\ndistribution\nconfiguration.\n\ncomputed\n\nby QUADPAN\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\nO\n\n(SOURCE)\n\n_\n\n_\n\nSURFACE\n_\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nt\n\nPANELS\n\nCL\n\nCL\n.\n\n_.\n\n- __\n\n/ _\'_-_J\n\n_\n\n/\n\nY_\n\n,_._\n\n,\n\nO.O\n\n0.0\n\nI\n0\n\n-0.4\nDOU\nWAKE\n\nBLET/VORTEX\n\n-0.8\n\n_\n\n(SOURCE)\n\nBOUNDARY\nCONTROL\n\nI\n8.0\n\nI\n16.0\n\n-0.4\n\n1\n\nCONDITION\nPOINT\n\n0.8Figure\n\n2.\n\nConcept\n\nof panel\n\n-\n\n0\n\nmethods\n\nI\n\n0.08\n\n0.16\n\nCD\n0.4\n\nUntil recently\nit was a common belief that a high\norder distribution\nwas required for better accuracy. The\nuse of high order distribution imposes a sizeable cornputational\ncost penalty. Special numerical techniques,\ndiscussed in reference 2, can greatly improve the accuracy and robustness\nof low order singularity distfibutions. QUADPAN\'s\nadvanced low order approach embodies\nthese techniques\nwhich give it an accuracy\nsimilar to that of the high-order methods but at a fraction of the computational\ncost.

This is due to its great geometric\ncapability\nand to its ease of use and computational\nefficiency.\nThese factors continue\nto make linearized\nmethodology\nthe workhorse\nfor conceptual\ndesign application.\nAlthough\nthe routine use of a linear method\nsuch as QUADPAN\ndoes not require supercomputer\ncapability,\nthe effectiveness\nof the method\nis greatly\nenhanced\nby it due to resulting reductions\nin computational cost and cycle time.\nNONLINEAR\n\nCFD METHODOLOGY:\nCODES\n\nfunded by the U.S. Air Force Flight Dynamics\nLaboratory, References\n6, 7, and 8.

Since it is\narchitectured\nin a multiple zonal structure,\nit is possible\nto solve different\nequation\ntypes in each zone. For instance, the thin shear-layer\napproximation\nto the Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes\nequations\ncan be solved\nin zones close to solid boundaries\nwhere boundary-\n\ning prediction requirements\nposed by the design of advanced\naircraft\nis far from being fully established.\nMuch work, particularly\nin terms of advanced\ncomputations and correlations\nwith appropriate\nhigh quality\nexperimental\ndata, has to be done before the realm of\npractical\napplicability\nand validity\nof Euler solutions\ncan be determined.\n\nlayer\n\n82\n\nbehavior\n\nis to be expected;\n\nall the\n\nshear\n\nstress\n\nterms can be accounted\nfor in zones where fully separated flow is likely to occur; and, finally, the Euler\nequations can be used to model the flow for the remaining zones.

But the full realization\nof the great potential\noffered\nby the application\nof CFD to aircraft design poses formidable, but not insurmountable,\ntechnical challenges.\nUndoubtedly,\nthe NAS will be highly instrumental\nin\nadvancing\nCFD technology\nthe level needed to success-\n\n83\n\nfully meet them. Some of the major difficulties\nto be\novercome,\nand probable\nfuture developments\nand\ntrends are highlighted\nin the remainder\nof this paper.\n\nFurthermore,\nturbulence\nmodeling\nis one area where\nthe NAS offers great potential for advancing the stateof-the-art.\n\nThe most important obstacle to the ready application of advanced CFD methods to airplane design is the\n\nThe availability of a wide variety of more capable\nscientific computers and supercomputers,\ncoupled with\nadvances in numerical solution algorithms,\nwill greatly\naccelerate the application of Euler and Navier-Stokes\nmethods\nto the solution of airplane design problems.\nComputers ranging in speed from 100 to 10,000 million\ninstructions\nper second and in memory capacity\nfrom\n8 to 256 milhon words will become commercially\navailable at competitive\nprices in the near future.\n\ndifficulty\nof generating adequate computational\ngrids\nfor complex\nthree-dimensional\nconfigurations\nin a\ntimely manner. Fortunately,\nsignificant progress is being made in this area. Advanced graphics software and\nhardware developments,\ne.g., color graphics workstations, are beginning\nto aid and speed up the grid generation process. Finite-volume\nzonal methods, such as\nthe ones discussed\nin this paper, facilitate the grid generation task. In addition, alternate approaches\nto the\ntreatment\nof complex geometries\nare being actively\npursued, examples of which are the work discussed\nin\nReferences\n11 and 12.\n\nThe analysis and optimization\nof multidisciplinary\ninteractions\nwill become commonplace\nthanks to the\ncapabilities of CFD and the foreseen increases in computer power and cost-effectiveness.\nCoupling\nCFD\nwith the computational\nmethodologies\nof other disciplines such as structures, propulsion,\ndynamics,\nand\nflight controls will allow the engineer to optimize not\nonly the aerodynamics\nbut also the structural components, propulsion\nand control systems, etc., in a fully\ninteractive and integrated manner. Great performance\nand cost benefits are likely to result from the synergistic\neffects of this interactive\nmultidisciphnary\noptimization.\n\nAssuming continuing development,\nit is very likely\nthat soon it will be possible to generate adequate computational grids about complete and arbitrarily complex\naircraft configurations\nin a matter of hours or days rather than weeks ,or even months, which is the time scale\nof present grid generation capability.\nTurbulence modeling will continue to be the Achilles\' heel of Reynolds-averaged\nNavier-Stokes\ncodes.\nReference\n13 provides a concise but comprehensive\nsurvey of the state-of-the-art\nin turbulence modeling.\nThis survey makes obvious that many difficulties\nremain. But in spite of the present short-comings\nof turbulence models, Navier-Stokes\ncodes will play an increasingly\nuseful\nrole\nin\nmany\napplications.\n\nFinally, supercomputers\nand wind tunnels\nare\ncomplementary\nand not exclusionary\ntools. This has\nbeen repeated many times, but the more experience we\ngain with CFD applications,\nthe more evident it becomes. It is also true that to further advance CFD, more\nhigh-quality\nexperimental\ndata are required.\n\n8_\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. Miranda,\nL. R.
