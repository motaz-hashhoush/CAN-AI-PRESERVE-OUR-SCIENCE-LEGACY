b'Firefighting\n\nModule\n\nA highly versatile NASA-developed\nmobile firefighting\nmodule made its commercial\nservice debut last year at\nDow Chemical U.S.A.\'s\nTexas Division, Freeport,\nTexas. The Dow module--called\nFirefly II and\nmanufactured\nby Aviation Power Supply, Inc., Burbank,\nCalifornia--is\nmounted\non a trailer pulled by a pickup\ntruck (above). The trailer unit has two three-inch\nwater\n"cannons"\nand the pickup carries a six-inch cannon,\ncompared\nwith the standard 2\xc2\xbd-inch hoses used by most\nfire departments.\nCompletely\nserf-contained,\nthe module\npumps 3,000 gallons of water a minute from hydrants or\nopen bodies of water. It can deliver its fire-quenching\nstream as far as 400 feet (left), or it can be employed\nin a\nhigh-loft mode to reach the tops of tall refinery towers\n(below left). The photos were taken during a 1980 Firefly\ndemonstration\nat the Dow facility.\nFor suppressing\nship or waterfront\nfires at the Freeport\nmarine terminal, the Firefly trailer can be backed onto\nDow\' s specially-built\nbarge fireboat (upper fight). Firefly\nalso serves as a backup to the Freeport facility\'s\nunderground\nfire main system; should the basic system\nbecome inoperable\nduring an emergency,\nthe mobile\nmodule could draw water from a pond or canal and feed\nit to the company\'s\nstandard fire trucks.\nThe compact Firefly II weighs only 2,500 pounds when\nfully fueled but it contains everything\nneeded to fight a\nfire. The key component\nis a specially-designed\ntwo-stage pump produced\nfor Aviation Power Supply by\nthe Ingersoll-Rand\nPump Group. Power for the pump is\ngenerated by a gas turbine engine--a\nderivative\nof a\nhelicopter\nengine--built\nby Detroit Diesel Allison\nDivision of General Motors Corporation.\nThe module\nalso includes an electronic\nengine/pump\ncontroller,\n\n66\n\nmultiple connections, 1,500\nhose\nupto\nfeetofhose, nd\na\nfuelforfourhours\noperation.\nFireflyI1isacommercial\noffshoot\nofaNASA/Coast\nGuard\nprogram\ninvolving evelopment\nd\nofalightweight,\nhelicopter-transportable\nfirefighting odule\nm\nforquick\nresponse\nincombating\nshipboard\norharborires.In\nf\ndirecting\nthedevelopment\neffort,Marshall\nSpacelight\nF\nCenter\ndrewupon\nitsaerospace\nexperience\nin\nhigh-capacity engine umps,\nrocket\np\nlightweight\nmaterials,\nand\ncompact\npackaging.\nThepump developed\nwas\nunder\nMarshall\ncontract\nbyNorthern\nResearch\nand\nEngineering,\nWoburn,\nMassachusetts,\nadivision\nof\nIngersoll-Rand.\nTheFireflyI thatemerged\nfromthe\ndevelopment\nprogram\nisbeing\ntested\nindemonstrations\nandregular\noperational atSt.Louis,Missouri\nuse\n(below)\ninaprogram\njointlysponsored\nbyNASA,the\nMaritime\nAdministration theCoast uard.\nand\nG\nAimof\ntheprogram\nistoevaluate\nthemodule\'sffectiveness\ne\nand\ncost-reduction\npotential\nasanemergency-use\nsystem\naboardommercial\nc\ntugboats\noperating\nasauxiliary\nfireboats.\nThecityofMiamisalso\ni\nevaluating\ntheFirefly\nasawaterborne\nfireprotectionystem.\ns\n\n'
