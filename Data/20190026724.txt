However, collecting landslide events in inventories is difficult at the global scale due to\n\n18\n\ninconsistencies in or the absence of landslide reporting. Citizen science is a valuable opportunity for\n\n19\n\naddressing some of these challenges. The new Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR)\n\n20\n\nsupplements data in a NASA-developed Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) with citizen science reports to\n\n21\n\nbuild a more robust, publicly available global inventory. This manuscript introduces the COOLR project\n\n22\n\nand its methods, evaluates the initial citizen science results from the first 13 months, and discusses future\n\n23\n\nimprovements to increase the global engagement with the project. The COOLR project\n\n24\n\n(https://landslides.nasa.gov) contains Landslide Reporter, the first global citizen science project for\n\n25\n\nlandslides, and Landslide Viewer, a portal to visualize data from COOLR and other satellite and model\n\n26\n\nproducts. From March 2018 to April 2019, 49 citizen scientists contributed 162 new landslide events to\n\n27\n\nCOOLR. These events spanned 37 countries in five continents. The initial results demonstrated that both\n\n28\n\nexpert and novice participants are contributing via Landslide Reporter. Citizen scientists are filling in data\n\n29\n\ngaps through news sources in 11 different languages, in-person observations, and new landslide events\n\n30\n\noccurring hundreds and thousands of kilometers away from any existing GLC data. The data is of sufficient\n\n31\n\naccuracy to use in NASA susceptibility and hazard models. COOLR continues to expand as an open\n\n32\n\nplatform of landslide inventories with new data from citizen scientists, NASA scientists, and other landslide\n\n33\n\ngroups. Future work on the COOLR project will seek to increase participation and functionality of the\n\n34\n\nplatform as well as move towards collective post-disaster mapping.\n\n35\n\nIntroduction\n\n36\n\nLandslides, or mass movements, cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in infrastructural damage\n\n37\n\nworldwide each year, warranting the need to understand their triggers and mitigate future losses [1,2].\n\n38\n\nLandslides are triggered by a variety of natural and human causes, most commonly rainfall but also\n\n39\n\nearthquakes, freeze-thaw cycles, mining, and other causes. These triggers loosen slope materials, resulting\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 2 of 38\n\n40\n\nin their downward and outward movement by gravity as landslides, debris flows, mudslides, rock falls,\n\n41\n\nearthflows, and other mass movements\xe2\x80\x94all referred to in this paper as landslides [3,4]. Knowledge of past\n\n42\n\nlandslides is the most important element for hazard and risk assessment because landslides are likely to\n\n43\n\noccur in areas that have previously experienced a failure [5\xe2\x80\x937]. Therefore, the collection of past landslide\n\n44\n\ninformation helps to predict future risk. To date, there are few global, publicly available inventories\n\n45\n\nproviding landslide data.\n\n46\n\nThe value and limitations of landslide inventories, and the Global Landslide Catalog\n\n47\n\n(GLC)\n\n48\n\nRobust and complete landslide inventories are crucial for understanding past landslide mechanisms and\n\n49\n\nforecasting future events. Landslide inventories, defined as spatial, temporal or spatiotemporal datasets of\n\n50\n\nlandslide events, are routinely used for many subject areas from characterizing landscape evolution, to\n\n51\n\ncalculating susceptibility and hazard, to supporting emergency response and planning efforts. There are\n\n52\n\ndifferent ways to compile a landslide inventory: collecting landslide distributions for a single triggering\n\n53\n\nevent; mapping landslides identified from satellite imagery or aerial photos, in situ mapping, or cataloging\n\n54\n\nreports from news media [6,8\xe2\x80\x9311]. Inventory production is the necessary first step for landslide risk\n\n55\n\nmanagement, but it must be followed by further work. NASA data and products help to support multiple\n\n56\n\nsteps in the process towards characterizing landslide risk (Fig 1), beginning with the landslide inventory.\n\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n\nFig. 1. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s role in landslide risk assessment.\nA simplified framework for how landslide inventories ultimately inform landslide risk assessment with\nthe data inputs needed to reach each step, modified from Kocaman and Gokceoglu, 2018. NASA has\ndeveloped several products that can support landslide risk assessment, outlined in teal. The contribution\nof a new NASA landslide inventory, the Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR), is\nshaded red.\n\n65\n\nThe Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) exemplifies one type of landslide inventory that provides the\n\n66\n\nestimated location and date of occurrence. The authors and supporting team members have been cataloging\n\n67\n\nrainfall-triggered landslide events from 2007 to the present, collected primarily from online news reports\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 3 of 38\n\n68\n\nfound using a Google Alerts search for relevant keywords. A landslide event was defined as a single\n\n69\n\nlandslide or multiple landslides tied to a location associated with a single triggering event [12]. The GLC\n\n70\n\ncurrently contains more than 11,500 reports, including 230 landslides from the Durham Fatal Landslide\n\n71\n\nDatabase (DFLD) [12\xe2\x80\x9314]. Gathering events from news reports was favorable to the authors\xe2\x80\x99 scientific\n\n72\n\ngoals because news reports can give an accurate event date, tying the events to probable triggering\n\n73\n\nconditions that can be used for model development [14]. In contrast, the dates of landslides cataloged from\n\n74\n\nsatellite or aerial imagery are uncertain due to typically long periods between image acquisitions.\n\n75\n\nInformation about landslides can be combined empirically or deterministically with data on precipitation,\n\n76\n\nslope, lithology, surface cover, etc. to characterize or model patterns and trends in landslide behavior over\n\n77\n\nshort to long time scales and local to global areas [5,9,10,15,16]. On a global scale, this data can help infer\n\n78\n\npatterns; for example, characterizing the seasonality of landslides in different regions of the world based\n\n79\n\non climate drivers [16], comparing areas of the world based on their vulnerability to landslides [2], and\n\n80\n\nevaluating the distribution and cost of fatal landslides [13,17]. The GLC has been corroborated as a template\n\n81\n\nfor landslide inventory design [13,18] and as a validation tool for worldwide landslide hazard and\n\n82\n\nsusceptibility modeling [15,16,19,20].\n\n83\n84\n\nDespite the need for comprehensive landslide catalogs, routine mapping of landslides is time-consuming\n\n85\n\nand resource-intensive [8,21,22]. Unlike hurricanes or earthquakes that have global monitoring systems\n\n86\n\n(e.g. Joint Typhoon Warning Center, http://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html; World Meteorological\n\n87\n\nOrganization Tropical Cyclone Program, https://severe.worldweather.wmo.int/; Global Seismographic\n\n88\n\nNetwork, https://www.iris.edu/hq/programs/gsn), or wildfires and floods that often can be globally mapped\n\n89\n\nfrom space due to their size and characteristics [23,24], landslide activity is not monitored at the global\n\n90\n\nscale. Landslides are frequently triggered by other natural hazards like earthquakes, floods, or hurricanes,\n\n91\n\nmaking the reporting of individual landslides difficult and their effects often indistinguishable from the\n\n92\n\ntriggering hazard [2]. Furthermore, landslides are usually small, widespread, and frequent, making it\n\n93\n\nimpossible with current technologies and funding to monitor and map landslides globally every day. A\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 4 of 38\n\n94\n\nsingle storm can generate tens of thousands of landslides [7,25]. Using the GLC methodology, recording a\n\n95\n\nsingle landslide event takes 20 minutes on average, which comprises of the time it takes to approximate the\n\n96\n\nlocation of the landslide from the news report and input all relevant details from the report. The addition of\n\n97\n\nall 11,500 landslides to the GLC has taken the GLC team a cumulative 1.6 years of 8-hour workdays to\n\n98\n\nreport.\n\n99\n100\n\nAnother challenge is identifying landslides in areas with limited imagery or data, limited newspaper\n\n101\n\nreporting, and/or in remote areas, creating spatial and temporal bias to the landslide inventory data [6\xe2\x80\x939].\n\n102\n\nThe GLC is affected by reporting biases that impact the spatial distribution of data in addition to the\n\n103\n\nchallenges listed for all landslide inventories [14]. These problems include reliance on reports written in\n\n104\n\nEnglish, improved reporting closer to populated areas or transportation networks, increased likelihood of\n\n105\n\nreporting when human life and property is involved, whether reporting networks exist, and bias from\n\n106\n\npolitical or economic differences among regions [12,14]. During validation of the Landslide Hazard\n\n107\n\nAssessment for Situational Awareness (LHASA) model, Kirschbaum et al. (2018) found that many areas\n\n108\n\nof modeled high landslide potential had few reports of past landslide events. The authors concluded that a\n\n109\n\nspatially consistent landslide inventory is \xe2\x80\x9cof foremost importance\xe2\x80\x9d to advance the LHASA model [16].\n\n110\n\nCitizen science was used in this project to extend data collection beyond the limitations of current methods.\n\n111\n\n112\n\nEnhancing the GLC with citizen science\n\n113\n\nCitizen science\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9ccrowd science\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity science\xe2\x80\x9d, among other terms\xe2\x80\x94is an increasingly popular\n\n114\n\nmethodology that is enabling the public to participate in the massive collection or analysis of data and\n\n115\n\nsolutions to scientific problems [26,27]. In the last two decades the number of publications involving citizen\n\n116\n\nscience projects increased by a factor of one hundred, attributed to the increasing use of citizen science data\n\n117\n\nby professional researchers, the availability of technical tools, and the emphasis on better science outreach\n\n118\n\nand communication [28,29]. The wide use of and access to the Internet, the Global Positioning System\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 5 of 38\n\n119\n\n(GPS), and geospatial/mapping programs like Google MyMaps (https://www.google.com/mymaps) or Esri\n\n120\n\nArcGIS (https://www.esri.com/) have enabled the public to crowdsource geographic information online for\n\n121\n\npurposes including citizen science [30]. To obtain data of sufficient quantity and quality, citizen science\n\n122\n\nprojects must raise the public\xe2\x80\x99s interest and provide standard methods for data documentation and access.\n\n123\n\nHowever, there are many examples of successful citizen science projects that have addressed these concerns\n\n124\n\nwith targeted outreach, proper project management, improving attitudes towards citizen science, and\n\n125\n\nimplementing standard training protocols and data quality checks [31,32]. Overall, the citizen scientist\n\n126\n\npublic gives scientists an opportunity to explore vast amounts of data and analysis tied to location and time-\n\n127\n\nbased information to advance research. Results from eBird (https://ebird.org/), a bird-sighting citizen\n\n128\n\nscience project, have been robust enough to visualize country-wide patterns in bird species distribution with\n\n129\n\nmore data than could be collected by traditional research [33].\n\n130\n131\n\nLike eBird\xe2\x80\x99s influence on ornithology research, citizen scientists can help collect greater quantities of\n\n132\n\nlandslide data while specifically addressing some of the limitations pervasive in existing landslide\n\n133\n\ncataloging efforts and the GLC. First, the sheer number of potential citizen scientists can capture a much\n\n134\n\ngreater quantity of data contributed, which can enable a much faster and less resource-intense mapping of\n\n135\n\nlarge numbers of landslides. More people to collect landslides minimizes the burden on the NASA landslide\n\n136\n\nteam, allowing for a more up-to-date global catalog and for rapid response during major triggering events.\n\n137\n\nIn situ reports made by citizen scientists can add information about locations that cannot be visited by\n\n138\n\nresearchers to strengthen the detail and accuracy of submitted data and helping to remove event uncertainty,\n\n139\n\nsuch as recording the state of the weather, approximate date, the surrounding environment, the movement\n\n140\n\nand possible cause of the landslide, and the photographing of the slide [34]. Finally, citizen scientists may\n\n141\n\nalso capture reports from non-English speaking media, helping to address some regional biases in the GLC.\n\n142\n143\n\nLandslide citizen science has already been applied across a variety of regions and methods. Table 1 lists all\n\n144\n\nlandslide citizen science projects that could be identified through internet searches. The scope and duration\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 6 of 38\n\n145\n\nof these efforts vary widely and exemplify the diversity of citizen science approaches for landslide studies.\n\n146\n\nThe projects outlined in Table 1 are generally led by scientists and use simple submission systems. Fourteen\n\n147\n\nof the 20 projects identified were government-led, university groups ran five projects, and a non-\n\n148\n\ngovernmental organization (NGO) led one project. The top-down approach of landslide citizen science\n\n149\n\nsuggests that institutions are important for organizing (and funding) a project at the start and constructing\n\n150\n\nthe research question(s) and infrastructure. By doing so, institutions with professional knowledge of\n\n151\n\nlandslide hazard and risk assessment can define what types of data are needed to address their scientific\n\n152\n\nquestions and create a platform suitable for their target community. Projects vary in scale but they tend to\n\n153\n\nask citizen scientists for the submission of landslide event information through a document or via email,\n\n154\n\nbecause reducing the level of professional expertise needed for data submission allows for the widest\n\n155\n\namount of participation [27,35].\n\n156\n157\n\nTable 1.

The landslide repository can be downloaded from Landslide Viewer, which is\n\n198\n\nautomatically updated two times a week. Alternatively, the data are also available on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Open Data\n\n199\n\nPortal (https://data.nasa.gov) under \xe2\x80\x9cGlobal Landslide Catalog,\xe2\x80\x9d which is updated less frequently.\n\n200\n\nLandslide Viewer has the most updated version of COOLR and the GLC.\n\nservers,\n\nat\n\nhttps://maps.nccs.nasa.gov/server/rest/services/\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nfolder\n\nPage 11 of 38\n\n201\n202\n\nLandslide Viewer was built using the Foldable Theme on Esri Web AppBuilder. Landslide Reporter was\n\n203\n\ncustomized from the Esri Crowdsource Reporter application (https://github.com/Esri/crowdsource-\n\n204\n\nreporter). COOLR data are available for download in a file geodatabase (.gdb) format, comma-separated\n\n205\n\nvalues (.csv) format, and shapefile (.shp) format. An additional data reference file is included to provide\n\n206\n\nattribution for inventories that have been directly added to the catalog and provided from outside groups.\n\n207\n\nRepository design\n\n208\n\nThe GLC served as the model for structuring the data fields during the creation of the repository. A modified\n\n209\n\nversion of the GLC data fields presented in Kirschbaum et al. (2015) is used as the input fields for COOLR.\n\n210\n\nThe fields included in COOLR are presented in Table 2. More information about the data fields can be\n\n211\n\nfound in Kirschbaum et al. (2010, 2015). Between the publication of Kirschbaum et al. (2015) and the\n\n212\n\nlaunch of the COOLR project, the \xe2\x80\x9cvery large\xe2\x80\x9d landslide size category was separated into \xe2\x80\x9cvery large\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\n213\n\n\xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophic\xe2\x80\x9d landslides. At the launch of the COOLR project, a new definition to quantify the landslide\n\n214\n\nsize categories was appended to each of the size categories to standardize the category and reduce\n\n215\n\nuncertainty when a value for the volume is given. The size category quantifications were informed by\n\n216\n\nobserving the reported volumes or reported number of trucks needed to haul away debris and size\n\n217\n\nclassifications in a random sample of past landslide events in the GLC. To establish a minimum volume\n\n218\n\nquantity, we observed that small landslides typically only took a few hours to clear with one standard\n\n219\n\ncommercial dump truck, which can hold about 8 to 11 m3 of material. To establish a maximum volume, we\n\n220\n\nconsulted a list of well-known historical landslides available and observed volumes for catastrophic\n\n221\n\nlandslides exceeded one million m3 [45,46]. The logarithmic scale of volumes was determined to be the\n\n222\n\nbest method to encompass all possible landslide sizes reported to the GLC.\n\n223\n224\n225\n\nTable 2.

Other information such as the trigger and time\n\n234\n\nof the event are helpful to identify a possible triggering event for the landslide [12]. COOLR is separated\n\n235\n\ninto two geodatabases, one for landslide event points and one for landslide event polygons.\n\n236\n237\n\nThere are two main sources for data in COOLR\xe2\x80\x94the GLC and citizen science data from Landslide Reporter\n\n238\n\n(Fig 3). The different contributors of the data are specified within the \xe2\x80\x9cEvent import source\xe2\x80\x9d field. GLC\n\n239\n\ndata contributed from within NASA are labeled as \xe2\x80\x9cGLC\xe2\x80\x9d, and Landslide Reporter data contributed by\n\n240\n\ncitizen scientists are labeled as \xe2\x80\x9cLRC\xe2\x80\x9d. After the GLC was incorporated into COOLR, the database was\n\n241\n\ncleaned to remove duplicate landslide events and events where no source was verified. Both the GLC and\n\n242\n\nLRC data are added to the same point or polygon geodatabase. The database is checked prior to a Landslide\n\n243\n\nReporter submission to ensure that there are not any duplicate reports in the GLC and LRC; however, a\n\n244\n\nsingle event may be reported separately to the point geodatabase and the polygon geodatabase.\n\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n\nFig. 3. Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) Components Schematic\nThe rectangle encompasses the sources of data within COOLR. The three sources are NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Global\nLandslide Catalog (GLC), citizen scientist contributions through the Landslide Reporter Catalog (LRC),\nand collated inventories from landslide experts and other citizen science projects.\n\n251\n252\n\nA third component of COOLR involves importing landslide inventories from landslide experts and citizen\n\n253\n\nscience projects to create a framework for open landslide data sharing and access (Fig 3). These\n\n254\n\nadditional inventories are included through the ArcGIS REST API or through manual import. Landslide\n\n255\n\ninventories hosted on servers external to NCCS are added via their Esri REST API directly to Landslide\n\n256\n\nViewer. Landslide inventories that must be imported manually and stored with NCCS are fitted to\n\n257\n\nCOOLR\xe2\x80\x99s fields (Table 2) and added to COOLR\xe2\x80\x99s geodatabase file. Each manually added landslide\n\n258\n\ninventory is modified into COOLR\xe2\x80\x99s fields on a case-by-case basis and validated with the author of the\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 15 of 38\n\n259\n\ndata prior to entry. A .csv file on the same page as the downloadable repository file lists the citation\n\n260\n\ninformation for manually added inventories.\n\n261\n\n262\n\nCOOLR citizen science and administration process\n\n263\n\nWe target all citizen science audiences to participate (landslide experts and non-experts) that have an\n\n264\n\neducation level of middle school and above. Researchers working with landslide data may be motivated to\n\n265\n\nimprove the catalog quality for themselves and others since the entire database is easily downloaded in\n\n266\n\nseveral formats. There are also university professors that have expressed an interest in having their classes\n\n267\n\nparticipate in this project as part of a lab for the class to teach about using and analyzing geospatial data\n\n268\n\nwhile contributing to a global cataloging effort. Landslide experts may also be interested in this project\n\n269\n\nbecause Landslide Reporter may help them keep track of landslides during or after field research. Non-\n\n270\n\nexpert citizen scientists have also become interested in participating. They are motivated to contribute in\n\n271\n\norder to learn more about landslides from the introductory materials provided at https://landslides.nasa.gov,\n\n272\n\naddress landslide issues within their communities, and/or help scientific research. There are additional ways\n\n273\n\nto incentivize citizen scientists to participate, which we discuss below in \xe2\x80\x9cFuture improvements to\n\n274\n\nCOOLR.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n275\n276\n\nWe seek to attract a diverse public who can fill in gaps in the inventory and alleviate current limitations,\n\n277\n\nand therefore we are not targeting any specific region. We hope to attract citizen scientists, whether living\n\n278\n\nin the area or reading international news reports, who can submit data for regions that currently have a\n\n279\n\ndearth of reports, such as in the Southern Andes, the East African Rift Zone and Turkey and Iran [16]. In\n\n280\n\ncontrast, we also welcome landslide reporting for data-rich areas like the United States because we hope\n\n281\n\nregular users will keep the repository up-to-date.\n\n282\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 16 of 38\n\n283\n\nThe ancillary goals of using citizen science in COOLR are to educate the public, serve as a teaching tool\n\n284\n\nfor educators about landslides, and encourage further scientific exploration. By using Landslide Reporter\n\n285\n\nand Landslide Viewer, citizen scientists can learn how to differentiate the types of mass movements (e.g.\n\n286\n\nmudslide, rock fall, translational slide, etc.) by following the training materials on the website. Additionally,\n\n287\n\nLandslide Viewer provides both the open landslide catalog as well as satellite and model products that can\n\n288\n\nhighlight the distribution of landslide hazard and impacts around the world or be downloaded in several\n\n289\n\ndifferent formats.\n\n290\n291\n\nFig 4 highlights the current submission and validation process for Landslide Reporter. To begin\n\n292\n\ncontributing, citizen scientists must log in to access the reporting form on Landslide Reporter. Citizen\n\n293\n\nscientists must accept COOLR\xe2\x80\x99s Landslide System Contribution Policy, Landslide Contributor License\n\n294\n\nAgreement, and the Take Down Policy before using the web application. Upon login with a Google\n\n295\n\naccount or Facebook account, each citizen scientist is automatically assigned a unique user ID, a random\n\n296\n\nstring of numbers and characters that is associated with their account. The ID is stored and used to find all\n\n297\n\nof a citizen scientist\xe2\x80\x99s previously contributed landslides in the inventory of reports held for review. No\n\n298\n\npersonally identifiable information is stored in any part of the system, and the unique user IDs are not\n\n299\n\nincluded with the downloadable version of the repository on Landslide Viewer.\n\n300\n301\n\nThere are several guides for how to fill in the fields within the application. Training materials are an\n\n302\n\nimportant asset to help citizen scientists learn how to use the web applications and submit data that are\n\n303\n\nvaluable for scientific research [27]. There are five how-to guides currently available on\n\n304\n\nhttps://landslides.nasa.gov, downloadable as .pdf files:\n\n305\n306\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimer and Landslide Identification\xe2\x80\x9d teaches readers about why it is important to study\nlandslides and provides information to help fill out the landslide category and landslide size fields.\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 17 of 38\n\n307\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n308\n309\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd a Landslide Event to COOLR\xe2\x80\x9d explains each field in the report form with guiding images\nfollowing the contents of Table 2 and how to navigate the web application.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLandslide Identification Training\xe2\x80\x9d is a training protocol for citizen scientists with little to no\n\n310\n\nprofessional experience. The identification guide gives examples of landslides types (landslide,\n\n311\n\nmudslide, debris flow, and rock fall) and their qualitative sizes (small, medium, large, very large)\n\n312\n\nfollowing the information in Table 2.\n\n313\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTips to Pinpoint Landslide Location from a News Article\xe2\x80\x9d helps citizen scientists use context\n\n314\n\nclues in a news source to find a reasonable latitude and longitude for the location of a landslide\n\n315\n\nusing Google Maps or Google Earth.\n\n316\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDownload and Export COOLR\xe2\x80\x9d guide has instructions on how to access the download page on\n\n317\n\nLandslide Viewer, how to cite the data, how to open the .gdb file in ArcMap or QGIS, and convert\n\n318\n\nthe file to a .csv.\n\n319\n\nThese guides will be updated as needed. For visual learners, the website also contains videos with an\n\n320\n\noverview for the project, how to navigate the web applications, how to export the data, and how to use the\n\n321\n\nArcGIS REST API. The website is also a resource to learn more about how the data are used by linking\n\n322\n\nvisitors related publications and projects.\n\n323\n324\n325\n326\n327\n328\n329\n330\n\nFig. 4. Landslide Reporter submission process.\nThe process is divided into three parts: Landslide Reporter, data validation, and Landslide Viewer. The\ngray indicates the parts of COOLR\xe2\x80\x99s component web applications that the citizen scientist and the public\n(the user) can interact with. The yellow indicates the process that a NASA scientist (the reviewer) must\nconduct in the backend for validating all citizen science data. Landslide Reporter and Landslide Viewer\ncan be accessed independently at any time.\n\n331\n\nOnce the citizen scientist completes and submits their report, the data are held for review on the NCCS\n\n332\n\nserver. After submission, citizen scientists can still access the report on the server to delete or make edits\n\n333\n\nto the report until the report is validated by the team at NASA. During the validation process, the NASA\n\n334\n\nreviewer will check the entire submission and make any modifications necessary to improve the accuracy\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 18 of 38\n\n335\n\nor detail of the report (Fig 4). All landslide events in need of validation are stored in an ArcMap database\n\n336\n\nand submissions are held for review. These data are overlaid with a map of previously recorded events in\n\n337\n\nCOOLR. Each submitted report is first checked for duplicates (S1 File). If the date of the reported event\n\n338\n\nmatches or is very close in date to an event already in COOLR, the descriptions of the events are compared.\n\n339\n\nIf it is determined to be a duplicate event, then any new information from the new reported event will be\n\n340\n\nmerged into the older event report. Once all the information is extracted, the newer event data will be\n\n341\n\ndeleted from the inventory of submissions held for review. For new landslide events, the report is\n\n342\n\nscrutinized for sufficient accuracy and detail (S1 File). This is performed either by comparing the reported\n\n343\n\ninformation to the source link in the \xe2\x80\x9cSource name\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSource link\xe2\x80\x9d fields or by checking the information\n\n344\n\nto the extent possible if the landslide event was an in-person observation. Then, the report will either be\n\n345\n\nadded to COOLR or deleted, and updated in Landslide Viewer accordingly.\n\n346\n\nCommunication and outreach\n\n347\n\nLandslide Reporter achieved a small following from outreach through social media. At launch in March\n\n348\n\n2018, the CitizenScience.gov and SciStarter blogs were the first to publicize the COOLR project [49,50].\n\n349\n\nSciStarter, in turn, publicized their post to the PLOS (Public Library of Science) Blog network\xe2\x80\x99s CitizenSci\n\n350\n\nblog and to Discover\xe2\x80\x99s Citizen Science Salon blog. We also advertised the project on Twitter and Facebook,\n\n351\n\nusing hashtags like #citizenscience or #citsci. Subsequent spikes in interest (more than 100 \xe2\x80\x9creblogs\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\n352\n\n\xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d) are attributed to the attention received through blog posts written by the American Geophysical\n\n353\n\nUnion\xe2\x80\x99s (AGU) The Landslide Blog and the NASA Earth Observatory [51,52]. The NASA Earth\n\n354\n\nObservatory blog post was then shared through Earthsky [53] and their community reblogged this at least\n\n355\n\n50 more times.\n\n356\n357\n\nOur existing communication strategy is to use Twitter and Facebook to share Landslide Reporter with the\n\n358\n\npublic, send updates about citizen scientist-submitted data, link to educational and relevant articles, and\n\n359\n\nhighlight project achievements. We also include our project on open citizen science project databases to\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 19 of 38\n\n360\n\nhelp increase interest of and drive traffic towards our project. Currently, Landslide Reporter is part of the\n\n361\n\nFederal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Catalog (https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/), the\n\n362\n\nSciStarter Project Finder (https://scistarter.com/finder), and the Science by Bike project database\n\n363\n\n(http://sciencebybike.com/explore-projects/). Through these methods, we have attracted the attention of and\n\n364\n\nsubmissions from landslide professionals, academics, students, and the public, evidence that we are\n\n365\n\nreaching the target audience of both landslide experts and non-experts. Commercial, academic, community\n\n366\n\nvolunteer, and government-led landslide groups have expressed interest in our project, and four of these\n\n367\n\ngroups have submitted landslide inventories now included in COOLR. One such group, the SERVIR-\n\n368\n\nMekong team (https://servir.adpc.net/) based in Huntsville, AL, conducted a landslide mapathon to fill in\n\n369\n\nthe gaps in Myanmar data in the GLC. The team collected over 1000 points from Google Earth imagery on\n\n370\n\nlocations of landslides in the region, transformed the information into the COOLR format, and provided\n\n371\n\nthe data for our team to manually include in the repository (Table 1).\n\n372\n373\n\nWe led a successful media blitz in August 2018 to engage more citizen scientists to submit to the project.\n\n374\n\nA Tumblr post and social media stories on the main NASA Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram shared the\n\n375\n\nimportance of studying landslides, connecting this work with other NASA missions such as the Global\n\n376\n\nPrecipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. The project linked back to the Landslides @ NASA website to\n\n377\n\nencourage interested viewers to become citizen scientists. The event ultimately brought ~5700 likes and\n\n378\n\n~1600 shares across Twitter and Snapchat, ~1100 notes (likes and shares) on Tumblr, and 80,000 views on\n\n379\n\nthe Snapchat story. These views translated into ~7,400 page views on landslides.nasa.gov and almost 100\n\n380\n\nnew followers across our project\xe2\x80\x99s social media platforms. As a result, there were ~30 new landslide reports\n\n381\n\nmade to Landslide Reporter in the first 24 hours of the social media campaign. On the day of the campaign,\n\n382\n\nan extreme rainfall even triggering widespread flooding and landslides occurred in Kerala, India [54].\n\n383\n\nLandslide Reporter received several reports of this event, highlighting the motivation of citizen scientists\n\n384\n\nto contribute to disaster response.\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 20 of 38\n\n385\n\nAnalysis for proof-of-concept\n\n386\n\nIn the results section, we present the preliminary results on landslide events in the LRC from the end of\n\n387\n\nMarch 2018 (project launch) to the end of November 2018 as a proof-of-concept. Though this is a newly\n\n388\n\nlaunched system with limited time for data collection, we evaluate the current entries to determine if the\n\n389\n\ncitizen scientist-contributed landslide data is of scientific quality and if the data provided can help fill in\n\n390\n\nareas that have a dearth of data. We use metrics of temporal distribution, spatial distribution (distances\n\n391\n\nbetween events, density of events), the count of source information language and type, location accuracy,\n\n392\n\nand associated landslide susceptibility from Kirschbaum and Stanley (2017) to analyze the data.\n\n393\n394\n\nThe analysis was carried out using the Esri ArcMap and Microsoft Excel. The data analyzed was\n\n395\n\ndownloaded from the public repository on Landslide Viewer with the exception of information about the\n\n396\n\nnumber of citizen scientists. The number of citizen scientists were counted by counting the number of\n\n397\n\nunique user IDs stored in the private version of the repository on the server. Analysis in ArcMap was\n\n398\n\nperformed using primarily the Spatial Analyst Package.\n\n399\n400\n\nResults and discussion\n\n401\n\nOver the 13-month study period, citizen scientists have contributed 162 landslide events to COOLR using\n\n402\n\nLandslide Reporter. These events have all been validated and added to COOLR. Additional reports were\n\n403\n\nsubmitted, but due to incomplete information, duplicates, or the submission of an inventory as one event,\n\n404\n\nthey were not added to the repository. Forty-nine participants submitted the 162 landslide events. A bulk\n\n405\n\nof reports were submitted by one \xe2\x80\x9csuper user\xe2\x80\x9d citizen scientist, which corroborates the importance of these\n\n406\n\nindividuals within citizen science communities [55,56]. Most other citizen scientists contributed one or two\n\n407\n\nreports. The reported landslides are distributed around the world, suggesting the potential reach this type of\n\n408\n\nplatform can have given more time and increased discoverability by citizen science networks. In the\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 21 of 38\n\n409\n\nfollowing analyses, the new Landslide Reporter Catalog (LRC) data were compared to the NASA Global\n\n410\n\nLandslide Catalog (GLC), containing 11,666 landslide events.\n\n411\n\nFilling in gaps in the repository\n\n412\n\nWe evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of the 162 reports we received since March 2018, to\n\n413\n\ndetermine whether our data are filling in gaps that have been observed in the Global Landslide Catalog.\n\n414\n\nThe reported LRC landslides are from 37 countries on five continents (Fig 5a). A time series of these\n\n415\n\nsubmissions are graphed in Fig 5(b). A landslide that took place in 1897 was excluded from the x-axis so\n\n416\n\nthe other yearly data can be seen clearly, and a second landslide was excluded for having no date.\n\n417\n\nPredictably, citizen scientists submitted the greatest number of landslides in 2018 and second-greatest\n\n418\n\nnumber in 2017. The number submitted in 2019 is steadily rising as the year progresses. The reported\n\n419\n\nlandslide events that occurred in previous years indicate that citizen scientists may also seek to fill in gaps\n\n420\n\nin historical records. For example, three citizen scientists submitted information about the Mud Creek\n\n421\n\nLandslide that occurred in Big Sur, California, USA, in May 2017. Though we had to delete the duplicate\n\n422\n\nsubmissions because they were already recorded in the GLC in COOLR, we moved new details about the\n\n423\n\nslide to the entry. One submission helped correct the location of the slide. These initial findings provide\n\n424\n\nevidence for how citizen scientists are able to enrich the existing repository in space and time.\n\n425\n426\n427\n428\n429\n430\n431\n432\n\nFig. 5. Distribution of landslide events by their location and time.\n(a) The map shows the spatial distribution of Landslide Reporter Catalog (LRC) events in red and Global\nLandslide Catalog (GLC) events in light blue. (b) The graph shows the temporal distribution of landslide\nevents in the LRC (in red) in comparison with events in the GLC (in light blue).\na\nThe number of landslides in the GLC for 2018 and 2019 is low because we have not yet updated the\ncatalog for this year.\n\n433\n\nThere is a large number of landslide points submitted to the LRC from Germany and Switzerland, mostly\n\n434\n\nby a single super user. Despite the disproportionality, this fills a gap in the landslide repository within this\n\n435\n\narea. We quantified the spatial density of points from the LRC and the GLC across Europe and subtracted\n\n436\n\nthe layers to see where each dataset had a more comprehensive distribution. The resulting map in Fig 6(a)\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 22 of 38\n\n437\n\nexhibits blue areas where GLC data are present and red areas where LRC data are more prevalent. If the\n\n438\n\nreports are compared with a global susceptibility map provided by Kirschbaum et al. (2016) [57] in Fig\n\n439\n\n6(b), the LRC reports are superimposed on the Alps and the hilly regions of Germany where landslide\n\n440\n\nsusceptibility is high but GLC reports are missing. Both maps visually demonstrate how citizen scientists\n\n441\n\ncan help fill in spatial gaps that exist in the GLC.\n\n442\n443\n444\n445\n446\n447\n448\n\nFig 6. Density and susceptibility of landslide events in Europe.\n(a) The map shows the spatial density and location of landslide events in Europe for the GLC and LRC.\nAreas that are darker blue are denser with GLC landslide events. Areas in darker red are dense with LRC\nlandslide events. (b) The map shows LRC events (in red), and GLC events (in light blue) overlaid with\nthe Kirschbaum et al. (2016) [57] landslide susceptibility map.\n\n449\n\nTo further analyze how gaps may be filled on a global scale, we measured the distance of each LRC\n\n450\n\nlandslide event to the nearest GLC landslide event. Fig 7 depicts a histogram of all the distances calculated.\n\n451\n\nThe greatest number of landslides submitted by citizen scientists occurred within 10 km of any landslide\n\n452\n\nevent compiled by our team at NASA. The GLC is robust enough to begin to characterize global patterns\n\n453\n\nin where and when landslides occur, so many LRC events will be located near GLC event data in highly\n\n454\n\nsusceptible areas [14]. However, there is a large proportion of events in the LRC that do not neighbour any\n\n455\n\nGLC event, with 20 events extending further than 150 km from the nearest GLC event. The farthest LRC\n\n456\n\nlandslide event reported was a cliff collapse in Santa Clara del Mar near Buenos Aires, Argentina, on\n\n457\n\nJanuary 2018, located 1215 km away from any GLC event. The results further suggest that this citizen\n\n458\n\nscience method helps to identify new landslide reports in landslide-susceptible areas not currently covered\n\n459\n\nby the GLC.\n\n460\n461\n462\n463\n464\n465\n\nFig 7. Distance to the nearest GLC landslide event.\nThe histogram illustrates the distance of each LRC landslide event to the nearest GLC event in the\nrepository in bins of 10 km. The last bin contains all distances greater than 150 km to the nearest GLC\nevent.\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 23 of 38\n\n466\n\nLastly, we examined how the challenges of language bias and reporter choice bias may be addressed by\n\n467\n\ncitizen scientists. Fig 8 illustrates that more than 60% of reported events in the LRC come from non-English\n\n468\n\nsources. Citizen scientists were able to submit or translate news articles and database entries from Catalan,\n\n469\n\nCzech, German, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish, and Ukrainian sources and enter\n\n470\n\nthe information into our English web application. Some of the reports are in-person observations, listed\n\n471\n\nwith a person\xe2\x80\x99s name or a permutation of \xe2\x80\x9cin-person observation\xe2\x80\x9d as recommended in our how-to guide.\n\n472\n\nSome of the eyewitness accounts were from landslide experts, submitted with expert details about the slide\n\n473\n\nand sometimes a link to a publication. The initial findings are promising for demonstrating how the known\n\n474\n\nbiases in the GLC could be reduced with the help of landslide expert and non-expert citizen scientists who\n\n475\n\npossess language capabilities and/or in situ observations to make reports in landslide-prone locations\n\n476\n\npreviously overlooked by the GLC methodology.\n\n477\n478\n479\n480\n481\n482\n\nFig. 8. Landslide event sources by language and type of source.\nThe event source specified in the \xe2\x80\x9csource name\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csource link\xe2\x80\x9d fields for each citizen scientistcontributed report are categorized by language and by the type of source, an in-person observation or an\nonline source.\n\n483\n\nSpatial characteristics of submitted landslides\n\n484\n\nIn addition to filling in regional or temporal gaps in COOLR, we want to know if citizen scientists are\n\n485\n\ncontributing spatially accurate and viable data for use with landslide maps and models. Fig 9 presents the\n\n486\n\nlocation accuracy of landslide events in the GLC and in the LRC, a quantitative measure of the citizen\n\n487\n\nscientist\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainty in the latitude and longitude of an event collected at the time of submission to\n\n488\n\nLandslide Reporter (Table 2). The greatest number of reports in the LRC had an \xe2\x80\x9cexact\xe2\x80\x9d location\n\n489\n\naccuracy, while the greatest proportion of reports in the GLC had a 5 km location accuracy. These initial\n\n490\n\nresults suggest that citizen scientists ascertain they can accurately pinpoint landslide locations, an\n\n491\n\nindication that the quality of the reporting in the LRC may enhance the COOLR database. During the data\n\n492\n\nvalidation process, we noticed that some citizen scientists specified much larger location accuracy values\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 24 of 38\n\n493\n\nin their reports (25 km and 50 km) but that we could verify these locations from the source article and\n\n494\n\ncorrect them to a value within 5 km. In the future, new application features such as using built-in\n\n495\n\nmeasurement tools and changes to the how-to guides may help to improve the characterization of report\n\n496\n\nlocation accuracy. Nevertheless, validated results indicate that citizen scientists are submitting\n\n497\n\nquantifiably accurate data to the LRC, and the improved spatial accuracy with respect to the GLC could\n\n498\n\nhelp scientists discern the environmental factors affecting landslides for their scientific models.\n\n499\n500\n501\n502\n503\n\nFig. 9. Number of landslide events by location accuracy.\nThe number of landslide events by their \xe2\x80\x9clocation accuracy\xe2\x80\x9d field in the LRC (in red) and the GLC (in\nblue).\n\n504\n\nLastly, we tested how the new LRC data might help improve landslide hazard modeling by\n\n505\n\nsuperimposing the LRC and GLC data with the landslide susceptibility map produced by Kirschbaum et\n\n506\n\nal. (2016) [15,57]. Data from COOLR will be used to validate the susceptibility map, the LHASA model,\n\n507\n\nand other products [15], so it is valuable to see whether landslides submitted are occurring in predicted\n\n508\n\nlandslide-prone areas. In Fig 10, the greatest proportion of LRC events are located in areas with high\n\n509\n\nlandslide susceptibility, while the smallest proportion of events are centered in areas of low landslide\n\n510\n\nsusceptibility. The results confirm the landslide susceptibility distribution of citizen scientist-contributed\n\n511\n\nevents is comparable to that of the GLC, demonstrating that the LRC may help to improve future versions\n\n512\n\nof the landslide susceptibility map, LHASA model, and other modeling efforts within the community.\n\n513\n514\n515\n516\n517\n518\n\nFig. 10. Modeled landslide susceptibility associated with reported events.\nThe landslide susceptibility value from the map produced by Stanley and Kirschbaum [15,57] associated\nwith each LRC (in red) and GLC point (in blue). The events are located on areas of low landslide\nsusceptibility to high landslide susceptibility.\n\n519\n\nDespite initial indications that the LRC can help to address gaps in the GLC repository, it is too early in the\n\n520\n\nproject to conclude that the citizen science contributions have reduced spatial biases in the repository, and\n\n521\n\nin some cases may have added additional bias due to the citizen scientist\xe2\x80\x99s geographic location (e.g.\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 25 of 38\n\n522\n\nGermany) and proximity to populated areas. Further, the number of landslide reports in this sample are too\n\n523\n\nsmall to draw conclusions about other spatial biases like political or economic differences among regions\n\n524\n\nor draw patterns of landslide hotspots. However, the number of in-person observations and reports from\n\n525\n\nnon-English sources, the appearance of citizen scientist-submitted reports far from any GLC landslide\n\n526\n\nevents, and the density of LRC points within areas not covered by the GLC (Fig 6) suggest that Landslide\n\n527\n\nReporter may be an important and effective tool to enhance and improve global landslide catalogs as the\n\n528\n\ncitizen science database grows over time.\n\n529\n\n530\n\nFuture improvements to COOLR\n\n531\n\nWhile early results of COOLR\xe2\x80\x94including Landslide Reporter and Landslide Viewer\xe2\x80\x94are promising,\n\n532\n\nmany improvements could increase the success of this system and fulfill the project goal of serving as an\n\n533\n\nopen repository for global landslide data sharing. First, the COOLR project has begun including other\n\n534\n\nlandslide inventories, so a procedure for systematically adding these inventories into COOLR must be\n\n535\n\ncreated. Inclusion through the ArcGIS REST API is straightforward because the inventory will be hosted\n\n536\n\nelsewhere and then referenced as a new layer on Landslide Viewer. However, an improved manual import\n\n537\n\nstrategy is needed to include other landslide inventories directly into COOLR. The landslide report fields\n\n538\n\nprioritized are heavily dependent on the research goals of an institution and may not include some of the\n\n539\n\nkey information the GLC and LRC requires, such as a date of the landslide event. Data fields not prioritized\n\n540\n\nby COOLR may end up as free text in the description field. We also foresee that the process of integrating\n\n541\n\ninventories will bring new challenges of spatial bias, temporal bias, and duplicate landslide events. Future\n\n542\n\nwork should follow best practices from recent research that analyzes other integrated landslide inventories\n\n543\n\ncreated from heterogeneous datasets [11,58,59].\n\n544\n545\n\nTo appeal to broader and more diverse audiences, particularly in areas where there is a current dearth of\n\n546\n\nlandslide data available, the User Interface (UI) of Landslide Reporter can be improved for a better citizen\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 26 of 38\n\n547\n\nscience experience. The current design of the application is accessible in both web and mobile layouts and\n\n548\n\nhas a simple submission form; however, Landslide Reporter requires an internet connection to interact with\n\n549\n\nthe form. One solution is to develop a standalone application that can be downloaded onto a mobile phone\n\n550\n\nor tablet to be used in situ or in areas of limited connectivity to increase use for fieldwork or disaster\n\n551\n\nresponses as well as encourage accurate submissions.\n\n552\n553\n\nAnother future improvement is to expand the interface to be accessible in other languages other than\n\n554\n\nEnglish, whether by human translation or through machine translation services like Google Translate\n\n555\n\n(https://translate.google.com/). Machine translations are not perfect, but they provide a low-cost service\n\n556\n\nwhen volunteer or paid translators are not available. If the application remains in English, the COOLR\n\n557\n\nproject website should provide translations of the how-to guides in other languages. At the time of this\n\n558\n\npublication, we are working with volunteer translators through the newly-formed \xe2\x80\x9cSciencing with NASA\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n559\n\nNASA Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sciencing/) to translate a two-page\n\n560\n\nintroduction to Landslide Reporter. One volunteer has expressed interest in translating more, so we have\n\n561\n\nasked her to translate the \xe2\x80\x9cAdd a Landslide Event to COOLR\xe2\x80\x9d how-to guide so citizen scientists have access\n\n562\n\nto the full instructions in a native language. We will make these materials available on our website to bring\n\n563\n\nlarger international audiences to the project.\n\n564\n565\n\nAlthough a simple form has been used by many citizen science projects in Table 1, there may be better\n\n566\n\nways of collecting landslide data. A future iteration, supported by user feedback, could test different\n\n567\n\ninterfaces or data collection methods, such as asking yes/no questions to populate each field (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cDid the\n\n568\n\nlandslide occur by a road?\xe2\x80\x9d), and having the option to submit or upload photos directly (an important\n\n569\n\nelement that is not included within the current architecture). Improving accessibility, transparency, and the\n\n570\n\nusability of Landslide Reporter, along with other user experience changes, can reach greater numbers of\n\n571\n\npotential citizen scientists for this project.\n\n572\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 27 of 38\n\n573\n\nNext, the current setup for approving reports prevents citizen scientists from tracking all of their previously\n\n574\n\ncontributed landslide events and it does not send feedback on the status of newly contributed reports.\n\n575\n\nFeedback is critical to the success of the project, because it lets citizen scientists know that their submissions\n\n576\n\nare accurate and contributing to science, a significant motivator for participation [60]. A future version of\n\n577\n\nLandslide Reporter should include an engaging User Interface where citizen scientists can see the total\n\n578\n\nnumber of reports they contribute to COOLR and receive feedback on why their previously contributed\n\n579\n\nreports were accepted, rejected, or modified during the quality control/data validation step in the process.\n\n580\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGamifying\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or adding in elements of a game\xe2\x80\x94the entire process may also encourage greater\n\n581\n\nparticipation or more frequent participation from those who like to score points, compete with their peers,\n\n582\n\nor collect prizes while doing citizen science [61]. Citizen scientists could be motivated to submit the greatest\n\n583\n\nnumber of landslides if they see other users\xe2\x80\x99 total number of approved landslides on a leaderboard. Another\n\n584\n\npotential motivation and feedback method is to reward citizen scientists with tangible prizes like badges or\n\n585\n\ncertificates. Such user-facing elements would improve the quality of reports received, further motivate\n\n586\n\ncitizen scientists who are driven by a desire to contribute to science, and show appreciation for citizen\n\n587\n\nscientists\xe2\x80\x99 time and effort.\n\n588\n589\n\nAn exciting future avenue in which we hope to move is using Landslide Reporter for disaster response and\n\n590\n\nmapping efforts, leveraging available remote sensing imagery and other sources to dynamically map\n\n591\n\nlandslides that can be immediately validated and seen by emergency response teams. Following a disaster,\n\n592\n\nwe envision that Landslide Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s polygon submission form could be used to systematically and\n\n593\n\ncollectively map landslides triggered by a major earthquake or storm, bringing in disaster-specific remote\n\n594\n\nsensing data. It could also allow participants to validate other citizen scientist submissions so that data\n\n595\n\napproval is timely. One example where this tool could have improved coordination and data sharing and\n\n596\n\ndissemination following a disaster was the 2015 Nepal earthquake in which a 7.8-magnitude earthquake\n\n597\n\nand its aftershocks resulted in widespread landsliding. A citizen science team of over fifty experts from\n\n598\n\naround the world formed an Induced Hazards Team (Table 1) and used high-resolution imagery to map\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 28 of 38\n\n599\n\nlandslides that may affect disaster response and recovery activities [1]. We can also look to the successes\n\n600\n\nof disaster mapping projects like Tomnod (http://www.tomnod.com/) and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap\n\n601\n\nTeam (https://www.hotosm.org/) for their best practices. Leveraging the power of citizen scientists, it could\n\n602\n\nbe possible to overcome difficulties in post-disaster landslide inventory collection like the mapping of\n\n603\n\nhundreds of thousands of landslides triggered in a single event [62] or inaccuracies in landslide locations\n\n604\n\nof the events in the GLC.\n\n605\n606\n\nWhile increasing the functionality and accessibility of the User Interface is vital to expanding the reach\n\n607\n\nand success of COOLR, the discoverability of this system is also fundamental. Therefore, we will develop\n\n608\n\nnew strategies to locate and attract potential citizen scientists for COOLR. We will continue to examine\n\n609\n\nthe successes of other citizen science data collection projects like eBird, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s GLOBE Observer\n\n610\n\n(https://observer.globe.gov/), and the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail & Snow Network\n\n611\n\n(CoCoRaHS) (https://www.cocorahs.org/) to learn more about how they are reaching out to new citizen\n\n612\n\nscientists. We may also be able to leverage their and other citizen science networks to promote this\n\n613\n\nproject. Future outreach should focus on how to involve more community groups and educational groups\n\n614\n\nbeyond social media who could potentially benefit from collecting and using the data. High school and\n\n615\n\nuniversity professors are also an important group to target as they could incorporate COOLR into their\n\n616\n\nEarth science course curriculums and labs to have students contribute to the repository as well as teach\n\n617\n\ndata analysis techniques. Furthermore, it has been studied that citizen scientists are driven to contribute by\n\n618\n\nboth intrinsic (desire to learn, do a hobby, meet people, impart knowledge, and help others) and extrinsic\n\n619\n\n(desire to gain experience for their career) motivations. Thus, additional social research could focus on\n\n620\n\nthe specific motivations compelling citizen scientists to contribute to Landslide Reporter [63].\n\n621\n\nConclusions\n\n622\n\nThe COOLR project represents a unique approach to provide openly available landslide inventories to the\n\n623\n\ncommunity as well as encourage citizen science participation to expand and improve landslide data, given\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 29 of 38\n\n624\n\nthat it is the first landslide citizen science project on a global scale. The three main objectives for this\n\n625\n\nmanuscript were to (1) introduce the COOLR project and its methods as a tool for building and sharing a\n\n626\n\nglobal landslide inventory using citizen science; (2) present the preliminary results of the Landslide\n\n627\n\nReporter project as proof-of-concept; and (3) discuss future improvements to the project to advance\n\n628\n\nlandslide data gathering with citizen science. To fulfill the first objective, this paper documented the setup\n\n629\n\nof the Landslide Reporter and Landslide Viewer web applications, the repository design, and the citizen\n\n630\n\nscience methods. Project outreach is performed using the widely-used social media sites Facebook and\n\n631\n\nTwitter with the help of news posts, NASA social media accounts, and citizen science project catalogs.\n\n632\n633\n\nNext, preliminary results from the 162 new landslide events collected by 49 participants in the first thirteen\n\n634\n\nmonths of operation demonstrated Landslide Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s ability as a successful citizen science project for\n\n635\n\nspatially and temporally diverse data that fills in data gaps and challenges known data biases. The collected\n\n636\n\nevents exhibited a wide distribution with events that occurred in 37 countries and from 1897 to 2019.\n\n637\n\nDuplicate events submitted by multiple citizen scientists still helped enrich the repository with new details\n\n638\n\nabout an event. A closer look at the density of events that occurred in Europe, submitted mostly by one\n\n639\n\nenthusiastic citizen scientist, revealed that citizen scientist-contributed data is already filling in spatial gaps\n\n640\n\nin the NASA Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) data. It also revealed the important role of citizen science\n\n641\n\n\xe2\x80\x9csuper users\xe2\x80\x9d working in tandem with citizen scientists who submit one or two reports. Furthermore, some\n\n642\n\nof these Landslide Reporter Catalog (LRC) events were located hundreds to thousands of kilometers away\n\n643\n\nfrom any existing GLC landslide events. Observations from social media and from the source information\n\n644\n\nsubmitted with landslide events indicated we are reaching target audiences of landslide experts and\n\n645\n\namateurs around the world who brought news sources and personal observations in 11 languages into\n\n646\n\nCOOLR. More than 60% of reported events contributed by citizen scientists came from non-English sources\n\n647\n\nand roughly 15% came from in-person sources, showing promise that language and newspaper reporting\n\n648\n\nbiases to the GLC may be reduced with the help of citizen scientists. An analysis of data location accuracy,\n\n649\n\na metric collected at the time of submission, revealed citizen scientists submitted proportionally more\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 30 of 38\n\n650\n\nspatially accurate landslides in comparison to the GLC. Lastly, superimposing LRC and GLC events on the\n\n651\n\nlandslide susceptibility map produced by Stanley and Kirschbaum [15,57] depicted both catalogs have\n\n652\n\nsimilar proportions of high, moderate, and low susceptibility events, corroborating the spatial accuracy of\n\n653\n\nthe citizen scientist data. This study analyzed the results of the first year since project launch, so it is too\n\n654\n\nearly to draw conclusions on how citizen science is handling other biases noted by Kirschbaum et al. [14].\n\n655\n\nHowever, these initial results show proof-of-concept for how this platform may help to address data gaps\n\n656\n\ncreated by collecting reports through the GLC methodology through in-person observations, non-English\n\n657\n\nsources, and the appearance of gap-filling LRC reports far from any GLC landslide event.\n\n658\n659\n\nThe global and open nature of COOLR means that the project could serve as a centralized place for the\n\n660\n\ncollection and dissemination of landslide data on local to global scales. We envision that researchers could\n\n661\n\nuse Landslide Viewer to locate existing landslide inventories and landslide data for an area of interest.\n\n662\n\nLandslide Viewer has already begun collecting regional and state-wide landslide inventories by referencing\n\n663\n\ntheir Esri ArcGIS REST API or by including them directly into COOLR. At the time of this publication,\n\n664\n\nfour state landslide inventories are referenced and four landslide inventories from academic and community\n\n665\n\nvolunteer groups are imported into COOLR, all available on Landslide Viewer. In parallel with Landslide\n\n666\n\nViewer, Landslide Reporter could be used as a central location for contributing landslide data, which can\n\n667\n\nbe especially useful to groups who do not have such a system in place locally for submitting such\n\n668\n\ninformation.\n\n669\n670\n\nAt this time, the COOLR project\xe2\x80\x99s reach is constrained by the English language, and the web application\n\n671\n\ncould use other features to make collecting landslides in Landslide Reporter more engaging considering the\n\n672\n\nlimited number of submissions received over the first year. Therefore, the third objective of this manuscript\n\n673\n\nwas to discuss ideas to expand and evolve COOLR in directions that will improve the types of data\n\n674\n\ncollected, how it is collected, the quality of the submissions, and the number of submissions. Presently, we\n\n675\n\nare bringing in volunteer translators to create a two-page document in other languages describing Landslide\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 31 of 38\n\n676\n\nReporter to reduce language barriers to use the application. Future versions of this project should strategize\n\n677\n\nintegrating other landslide inventories into the repository that have different fields in their databases. We\n\n678\n\nalso foresee improving the user experience by allowing users to access their past submissions, incentivizing\n\n679\n\ncitizen scientists through game elements in the application, inviting expert citizen scientists to participate\n\n680\n\nin data validation, and adding in machine or human translation. Finally, we hope to include collective post-\n\n681\n\ndisaster mapping in Landslide Reporter, allowing citizen scientists to contribute to post-disaster response,\n\n682\n\nrecovery, and mitigation.\n\n683\n684\n\nGiven that COOLR is a research project and subject to the same funding processes as other research grants,\n\n685\n\nthe evolution of future improvements to COOLR outlined above are still unknown. Nevertheless, we are\n\n686\n\nencouraged by the preliminary results and feel that citizen science is an optimal path for improving the\n\n687\n\nGLC and opening up more landslide data to the global community. We hope to continue the project and\n\n688\n\nwill work with national and international partners and stakeholders to examine the different ways in which\n\n689\n\nCOOLR may evolve. We hope COOLR will become a highly useful tool for collecting and sharing landslide\n\n690\n\ndata on all geospatial scales and substantially improve access to and accuracy of landslide information that\n\n691\n\ncan be used for risk assessment, research, and decision-making to save lives and property.\n\n692\n\nJuang, Stanley, and Kirschbaum (2018)\n\nPage 32 of 38\n\n693\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n694\n\nWe would like to thank Jim Shute (NASA GSFC/ASRC Federal), Laura Carriere (NASA GSFC/CSC),\n\n695\n\nDan Duffy (NASA GSFC), and Neh Patel (NASA GSFC/CSC) at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation\n\n696\n\n(NCCS) for generously hosting and maintaining Landslide Reporter and Landslide Viewer.

This process is subject to change as the COOLR project continues to improve.\n\nChecking for duplicates\nThe data from the Landslide Reporter Catalog (LRC) is overlaid with data of all other previously\nrecorded events in COOLR in Esri ArcMap. COOLR data in the surrounding area, centered on the\nreported landslide event, are selected with the \xe2\x80\x9cIdentify\xe2\x80\x9d tool. The distance from the reported landslide\nevent to the farthest COOLR event in the selection is dependent on the location accuracy of the reported\nlandslide event. The NASA reviewer compares the date of the reported event to the dates of the selected\nevents from COOLR. If the date does not overlap with any of the events in COOLR and the event details\ndo not match any of the other events in the selection, it is assumed to be a new event. If the date of the\nreported event matches or is very close in date to an event already in COOLR, the descriptions of the\nevents are compared.\n\nChecking for sufficient accuracy and detail\nSufficient accuracy and detail are checked by looking at each row of data entered in the database in Esri\nArcMap. The criteria for checking each landslide report is as follows:\nSufficient accuracy:\n1. If the report links to a source:\na. Compare the landslide event\xe2\x80\x99s location on the map to the location information given in the\nsource. All given location details from the source must match the report. Check that the\nappropriate location accuracy is given.\n\nb. Compare the details of the event, including the date, landslide category, trigger, fatalities,\nlandslide setting, and other fields. All information must match either the information in the\nsource or the photo given in the source.\n2. If the report is an in-person observation:\na. Compare the landslide event\xe2\x80\x99s location on the map to the location information given in the\nlocation description. If the landslide event is old enough and at a scale that satellite imagery is\navailable, compare the landslide location on the map to historical satellite imagery in Google\nEarth.\nb. If a photo is included in the event report, use the photo to verify details of the event including\nthe landslide category, landslide setting, and possibly landslide trigger.\nSufficient detail:\n3. If the report links to a source:\na. Verify if all of the details from the source have been captured and put into the landslide event\nreport in the fields that can be filled.\n4. If the report is an in-person observation:\na. Since details cannot be properly verified for accuracy, check that all fields in the report are\nfilled out with as much information as possible. Enough detail must be written or filled in as\npossible so that it is possible to understand when, why, and how the landslide may have\noccurred, and optionally what the consequences were.\n\nIf the new citizen scientist-contributed report does not have sufficient detail or has inaccuracies,\nthe reviewer makes corrections to the report based on the source linked in the report. If the source\ninformation is not in English, Google Translate (https://translate.google.com) is used to gather as much\ninformation as possible. If a report does not have source information and the report does not have any\ndetail, the landslide report will be deleted.\nOnce a report is sufficiently accurate and detailed, the NASA reviewer copies the report from the\ninventory of submissions held for review to COOLR and then deletes the report from the inventory of\nsubmissions held for review. Data deleted will no longer appear when a citizen scientist accesses the \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nSubmissions\xe2\x80\x9d section in Landslide Reporter, and citizen scientists are not notified if their report has been\napproved or not at this point.\n\n'
