A wide variety of missions is possible, including flyby, rendezvous, and even sample return. The multi-asteroid rendezvous concept requires an ion drive low-thrust propulsion system of the type being developed for a comet rendezvous. It is indicated that there are plentiful opportunities for such missions to visit four asteroids with stay times of 60-90 days each and with transit times between rendezvous of the order of a year.", "title": "Asteroid mission alternatives", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T08:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780021078, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Niehoff, J.
