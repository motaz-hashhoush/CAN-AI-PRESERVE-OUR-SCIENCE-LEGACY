The proceedings of the five earlier symposia were published as listed in the references to this preface.\nThe ICAF is an informal organization of experts on fatigue from 10 nations.\nEach nation is represented by a single representative, in most cases from the national\naerospace research organization in his country. J. Branger of Eidg. Flugzeugwerk,\nEmmen, Switzerland, is Executive Secretary. The Committee was organized among five\nWestern European nations in 1952 to promote a "fruitful and effective exchange of information on all aspects of aeronautical fatigue problems among the member nations." The\nCommittee was gradually expanded until it reached its present size in 1965. Biennial\nmeetings are organized and hosted by the members on a rotating basis.\nThe theme of the Symposium, "Advanced Approaches to Fatigue Evaluation," permitted discussion of many broad aspects of the fatigue problem in aeronautical structures.\nThe introductory lecture, "The Philosophy Which Underlies the Structural Tests of\na Supersonic Transport Aircraft With Particular Attention to the Thermal Cycle," presented by E. L. Ripley of the United Kingdom who was especially invited as the Plantema\nMemorial Lecturer, follows a tradition established 4 years earlier at the Melbourne\nmeeting of ICAF. The Memorial Lecture honors Dr. Frederick J. Plantema, the first\nExecutive Secretary of ICAF. In his modest but effective manner, Dr. Plantema was the\ndriving force for organizing and directing ICAF during its first 14 years.\nThis volume contains the complete text of each of the papers presented at the\nSymposium and three additional papers submitted later that were judged to be important\nadjuncts to these proceedings.\nThe editors sincerely appreciate the enthusiastic support of other ICAF members\nwho solicited papers from their respective countries and acted as session chairmen at\nthe meeting. They wish to express appreciation also to the authors who prepared and\ndelivered papers for the Symposium. Finally, grateful acknowledgment is made to the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose financial and administrative support made the Symposium and the publication of these proceedings possible.\n\niii\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

PARTICULAR\nATTENTION TO THE THERMAL CYCLE\nBy E. L. Ripley\nRoyal Aircraft Establishment\nFarnborough, Hampshire, United Kingdom\nSUMMARY\nThe supersonic transport aircraft has brought a new challenge to the structural\ntest engineer. Over the years he has developed skills in representing in the laboratory the conditions that occur in flight and in devising techniques to apply these to the\nstructure. Supersonic flight has introduced important new features into the test programme, particularly for supersonic transport aircraft. Of these new features the\nmost significant is probably the prolonged heating and then cooling of the structure\nduring each flight. Much basic research has been necessary to understand the effects\nof such a thermal cycle on the structure, and novel engineering techniques have been\ndeveloped to simulate the cycle in the test laboratory.\nThe information presented in this paper is based on data obtained from the\nConcorde. Much of this data also applies to other supersonic transport aircraft. The\ndesign and development of the Concorde is a joint effort of the British and French, and\nthe structural test programme is shared, as are all the other activities. Vast numbers of small specimens have been tested to determine the behaviour of the materials\nused in the aircraft. Major components of the aircraft structure, totalling almost a\ncomplete aircraft, have been made and are being tested to help the constructors in\neach country in the design and development of the structure. Tests on two complete\nairframes will give information for the certification of the aircraft. A static test was\nconducted in France and a fatigue test in the United Kingdom. Fail-safe tests are\nbeing made to demonstrate the crack-propagation characteristics of the structure and\nits residual strength.\nThe paper describes these aspects of the structural test programme in some\ndetail, dealing particularly with the problems associated with the thermal cycle. The\nbiggest of these problems is the setting up of the fatigue test on the complete airframe; therefore, this is covered more extensively with a discussion about how the\ntest time can be shortened and with a description of the practical aspects of the test.\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBackground\nIn 1967 a paper entitled \'Design Philosophy and Fatigue Testing of the Concorde"\nwas presented at the Fifth Symposium of the International Committee on Aeronautical\nFatigue (ICAF) at Melbourne, Australia. (See ref. 1.) Four years later, the basic subject of the structural testing of a supersonic transport aircraft is to be considered again\nby the ICAF, this time at the Sixth Symposium at Miami Beach, Florida, U.S.A. In the\nmeantime, some updating of the subject was given in a paper to the Eleventh AngloAmerican Conference at the Royal Aeronautical Society, London, in 1969 (ref. 2). The\npresent paper brings the story up to date and in doing so incorporates an appreciable\namount of the basic information from the other papers for completeness.\nThe state of the art in structural-strength testing is now well advanced, and the purpose of the present paper is to examine the way this state has to be further developed to\nmeet the needs of the supersonic transport aircraft. The supersonic transport aircraft\nwill be subjected to all the familiar patterns of ground and flight loads, and these patterns\nmust be represented in the structural tests using the techniques which have been developed\nand proven over many years. What is new is the thermal cycle which produces prolonged\nheating and then cooling during each flight. The thermal cycle sets up thermal stresses\nwhich are in themselves another loading action. Prolonged time at elevated temperature\nintroduces creep and overageing. Further consideration of interaction effects which the\nthermal cycle may have on the static and fatigue strengths of the aircraft is necessary.\nThe data presented in this paper were obtained from structural tests on the\nConcorde, and illustrations are given of what has been done on that aircraft. The principles underlying this work are believed to be equally applicable to other supersonic\ntransport aircraft. The design and development of the Concorde (fig. 1) are a joint effort\nof the British and the French, and the structural test programme is shared, as are all the\nother activities. Throughout the programme the aim has been to employ wherever possible test techniques which have been well established and proven throughout the years.\nMuch new research has, however, been necessary to understand the effects of the thermal\ncycle on the structure, and novel engineering techniques have been developed to simulate\nit in the test laboratory.\nVast numbers of small specimens have been tested to determine the behaviour of\nthe materials used in the aircraft. Major components of the aircraft structure, totalling\nalmost a complete aircraft, have been tested to help the constructors in each country in\nthe design and development of the structure. Two complete airframes will be tested to\ngive information for the certification of the aircraft. A static test will be made in France\nand a fatigue test in the United Kingdom. Fail-safe tests are being made to demonstrate\n6\n\nthe crack-propagation characteristics of the structure and its residual strength. Drop,\nstatic, and fatigue tests are being made on the nose and main undercarriages. Acoustic\nfatigue tests are being made to investigate the effects on the structure of engine noise and\nvarious pressure-fluctuation effects in the airflow. Dynamic response in the structural\nloads is being measured on the structure in ground tests and in flight tests. The measurements and tests are most comprehensive, and the Concorde will certainly be one of\nthe most thoroughly tested aircraft ever flown.\nIt is not possible in this paper to cover all these aspects in full detail, and preference is given to the strength-test programme with particular reference to the problems\nassociated with the thermal cycle. The biggest problem has been the setting up of the\nfatigue test on the complete airframe, and some of the practical aspects of this are dealt\nwith hereinafter.\nPhysical quantities used in this paper, their basic unit, and pertinent conversion\nfactors are listed in table I.\nStructural-Load Environment\nA typical flight profile of the Concorde is that after take-off the aircraft will climb\nsubsonically to a suitable altitude and then, still climbing, accelerate to its cruising speed\nof about a Mach number M of 2.0. After the cruise phase has been completed, the aircraft will decelerate to subsonic speed at altitude and then descend to its destination.\n(See fig. 2.) In the initial climb at subsonic speeds, the external surfaces of the aircraft\nwill cool a little and then heat up in the acceleration phase to a temperature of about\n1000 C, which will be maintained during cruise. (See fig. 3.) During deceleration and\ndescent, the external structural temperature will drop to about -20 0 C and rise again to\nambient temperature on landing. (See fig. 4.)\nThe Concorde will be subjected to all the normal aircraft loads \xe2\x80\x94 taxying loads,\nground-air-ground cycle, gust and manoeuvre loads, cabin pressurisation, etc. Almost\nall of these will occur while the aircraft is on the ground or flying subsonically; that is,\nwhile the structure is at ambient temperature before the acceleration phase or is\napproaching ambient temperature after the deceleration phase. The exception is any turbulence which may be encountered while the aircraft is flying supersonically and the\nstructure is hot.\nOne of the most important of the thermal effects is the thermal stress which develops because the temperature of the internal structure lags behind that of the surface\nstructure as a result of the time it takes for heat to be conducted to it. Thus on the climb\nthe external structure will be hotter than the internal structure, and this will set up thermal stresses due to the different amount of expansion. During the cruise the temperature\nof the internal structure will gradually approach that of the external structure and the\n7\n\nthermal stresses will decay. The reverse effect takes place during descent and recovery\non the ground; thus, thermal stresses of opposite sign are produced. Such a stress situation has a significant effect on fatigue life. If the structure is deep, these stresses are\nabout one-half the maximum stress permissible for the required life.\nTwo other thermal effects which need to be considered are overageing and creep.\nWhen a material is being manufactured, it is often subjected to heat treatment to "age"\nit in order to obtain its desired strength. If subsequently it is subjected to long periods\nat elevated temperature, it will "overage," and its strength will fall slightly. If the material is subjected to long periods at elevated temperature while under load, it will "creep"\nwhich means it will remain extended or deformed even after the load and temperature are\nremoved. It is necessary to ensure that the amount of creep occurring is limited so that\nunacceptable deformation of the structure is prevented. An upper limit of 0.1-percent\ntotal plastic strain after 20 000 hours was chosen as a reasonable criterion, based mainly\non structural experience in which a 0.1-percent tensile-proof condition has been used for\ndesign purposes for many years.\nThus the structure is subjected to the normal loading environment interspersed with\nperiods at elevated temperature and a thermal-stress cycle each supersonic flight. This\nenvironment is further complicated by the presence of fuel tanks acting as heat sinks, with\ntheir changing levels of fuel during flight and with fuel transfer from tank to tank to preserve aircraft balance for subsonic and supersonic flight. The task of the designer and\ntest engineer is indeed complex since he must understand and interpret all of these effects\nand their interactions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author gratefully acknowledges the able and willing assistance of his colleagues\nin the Royal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E.), especially those in the Structures\nDepartment, who helped with all the many details necessary for the preparation of the\npaper and made valuable contributions to its content.

Aluminium alloy was a desirable choice since its aircraft production capabilities were well understood and it would be able to withstand the thermal effects over almost\n8\n\nall the airframe. In a few areas where the temperatures were greater, such as near the\nengines, steel, titanium, or nickel alloys could be used. The task was therefore to choose\na suitable aluminium alloy to give the best overall performance. Several were evaluated\nand the present Concorde material was evolved from an aluminium alloy which originally\nwas developed to withstand the rigours of use in an aircraft engine. An important criterion in the choice of this material was its creep behaviour, which is superior to that of\nother aluminium alloys currently being used in subsonic aircraft. In parallel with the\nwork on metallic materials, a similar programme was conducted on nonmetallic materials.\nIt is not possible within the scope of this paper to tell the story of all the research\nand development work. A tremendous amount of work has been done in both countries, is\nbeing continued, and will be continued right through the certification test programme to\nprovide the necessary backup knowledge for planning and interpreting that programme.\nQuite early, two things became apparent from the work on the Concorde aluminium\nalloy:\n(1) Overall creep distortion was unlikely to be a hazard; that is, creep distortion at\nstresses to be used in the design would not reach the 0.1-percent limit set to avoid\nunacceptable distortion of the aircraft;\n(2) Overageing had little effect on static strength; that is, the reduction in static\nstrength due to prolonged time at elevated temperature was small and could easily be\ncontained by a small factor in the allowable design stresses.\nThe next step was to see whether exposure to heat, with or without load, affected\nthe fatigue performance of the material in structural configurations and to find out if\nstresses arising from temperature differences across the structure (thermal stresses)\ncould be regarded simply as equivalent in effect to the same stresses arising from externally applied loads in accumulation of fatigue damage. Clearly at this stage in design,\nit would not have been practical to await results of tests in real time and temperature conditions; therefore, much of the early work was conducted under accelerated conditions on\nthe basis of Fisher\'s parameter which gives a relationship of the form\ntl\nlog t2\n\nT 2 - T1\n= C T1T2\n\nwhere t l and T 1 are, respectively, the exposure time and absolute temperature in the\nreal environment, t 2 and T 2 are the corresponding times and temperatures in accelerated conditions, and C is a constant (approximately 8200 0 K for the material concerned). On this basis the anticipated service environment was represented in much of\nthe early work for Concorde by exposure times of 1000 hours at 150 0 C, which gives an\n9\n\nequivalence of 30 000 hours at 120 0 C or 400 000 hours at 1000 C. At the same time as\nthe accelerated test programmes were initiated, tests were begun using temperature and\ntime exposures close to real service conditions; such tests span several years, and it is\nonly recently that results have started to accrue.\nIn planning the research programmes, it was also borne in mind that both under the\nspecial conditions of the full-scale fatigue test and under the actual service environment,\nthere would be considerable deviations at different points in the structure from the nominal stress and temperature conditions. To meet this situation, the general policy was to\nconcentrate the more detailed investigations on the nominal conditions and to explore\ndeviations to either side with a comparatively light coverage of test conditions. This\napproach would give sufficient information to enable correction factors to be derived under\nsuch deviating conditions, and these correction factors would be of vital importance in\ninterpreting any failures occurring during the full-scale tests.\nIn the majority of the early programmes, attention was centred primarily on the\neffect of heat exposure on cycles (or "flights") to failure, but as the research and development programmes built up, increasing attention was paid to examining the effects of\nheat exposure on the crack-nucleation phase of damage growth and on the subsequent\ncrack-propagation phase since there was no presupposed reason to assume that both\nphases of damage growth would be equally affected. This aspect had to be explored both\nunder accelerated and real-time conditions so that, for example, crack-initiation times\nobserved during the full-scale fatigue test could be interpreted in terms of true\nenvironment.\nAn enormous programme of work has been done and is continuing to obtain information on the foregoing problems; many types of specimens are being used, ranging from\nsimple notched and riveted-joint coupon specimens to large structural components.\nLoading and environmental conditions have varied from simple sinusoids with a block of\nheat representing the total service exposure introduced at some point in the fatigue test\nto elaborate representations of a flight cycle of mechanical loads with appropriate heating\nand cooling conditions to induce representative thermal stresses.\nAll this work is giving an empirical understanding of the behaviour of the structure\nunder the thermal environment. More fundamental work is also being done to try to\nunderstand the metallurgical phenomena involved.\nExamples of Research\nIt is beyond the scope of this paper to attempt full presentation of the results\nobtained so far, but some results are outlined subsequently. These serve to illustrate the\nkind of work that has been done and the nature of the answers that have been obtained.\nThree examples have been chosen. They show how this work has given understanding and\n10\n\ndata for design, and also, particularly in the context of this paper, how this work provides\nessential information for planning and interpretation of the full-scale fatigue test.\nEffect of repeated application of heat on fatigue life.- This first example shows the\ntrends which have emerged from fatigue-heat interaction tests on Concorde material.\nThe variation in the ratio of life with heat exposure to life cold with temperature during\nheat exposure and the creep stress is illustrated in figure 5. The results on which these\ntrends are based were mainly obtained from tests in which periods of heat, with or without mean stress application, were applied periodically during the fatigue life; the mechanical loading patterns included a simple representation of the gust loading and the groundair-ground cycles. It is considered unlikely that significant thermal stresses were\ninduced in any of the specimen types. It should also be borne in mind that in grouping\nthese data, results were put together from tests having considerable detail variations\nin loading patterns and numbers of heat interspersions during life. Nevertheless, the\ntrends give a qualitative indication of behaviour, and the following conclusions may be\ndrawn:\n(1) Performance reduces as the temperature rises from 1200 to 180 0 C.\n(2) Performance is better with tensile creep stress than with zero creep stress,\nthough the improvement is seen to be falling off for the riveted joints at the higher creep\nstresses.\n(3) Performance appears to improve in moving from the simple notched specimen\nto the riveted-joint specimen and, again, to the relatively complex fabricated box; reasons\nwhy this may be so are discussed subsequently.\nEffect of heat on nucleation and crack-propagation phases of fatigue life.- This\nexample has been chosen to illustrate one of the more fundamental research studies. The\nwork was undertaken to obtain an understanding of the modifying effects of heat on the\ngrowth of fatigue damage at different stages in the life of a specimen under test. In all\nthe tests, fatigue cycling was carried out at room temperature under fluctuating tensile\nloading. After a mean (nominal) life to failure was established, a single application of\nheat was introduced at a certain percentage of nominal life; the fatigue cycling was\nstopped during this period, and the mean load was adjusted to give tensile, zero, or compressive creep. After cooling, the fatigue cycling was then resumed, and from consideration of the total fatigue life to failure, the damaging or beneficial effect of the heat exposure was assessed. In the majority of the tests, the heat exposure was 150 0 C for\n1000 hours, but the work also included a small number of long-term tests in which the\nexposure was 120 0 C for 20 000 hours. The tests were carried out on notched, pinnedlug, and clamped-lug specimens. Some of the results for the notched and pinned-lug\nspecimens are shown in figure 6. It is evident from the results of the tests on the notched\nspecimen that\n11\n\n(1) Exposure to heat without load during the first half of the fatigue life has a detrimental effect on fatigue performance.\n(2) This detrimental effect is to some extent alleviated by tensile creep, and\nconversely.\n(3) Compressive creep increases the damaging effect of heat alone.\n(4) Exposure to heat during the crack-propagation phase has a relatively small\neffect.\nThe foregoing test results, supported by examination of the fracture surfaces, have\nled to a general explanation of the effects of heat and creep on the growth of fatigue damage. The effect of heat alone is to speed up the development of fatigue damage nuclei and\nhence to reduce the crack-initiation period; a marked reduction in scatter in endurance\nhas been noted after heat exposure, which is in keeping with this explanation. Until comparatively recently, the more rapid appearance of damage nuclei was explained in terms\nof the relaxing effect of the period of heat on beneficial residual compressive stresses\nwhich are often inadvertently introduced at the notch surfaces during manufacture.\nRecent metallurgical studies have shown that another, and perhaps more important,\nchange takes place in the surface material at the notch during heating.\nIt has been found that machining leaves behind a work-affected zone some 50 \xc2\xb5m\ndeep having a hardness approximately twice that of the interior material. In "as\nreceived" specimens, fatigue cracks, in fact, initiated below this zone. The heat exposure was found to reduce the surface hardness to that of the interior material, and cracks\nthen developed from the surface. This phenomenon, combined with some relaxation of\nresidual manufacturing stresses, is believed to explain the observed reduction in crackinitiation time; the biggest reductions, of course, were observed when heat preceded\nfatigue cycling. When load is applied during heating, plastic deformation of the material\nin the vicinity of the notch will be encouraged; that is, tensile loading will tend to induce\ncompressive residual stresses at the notch so that after the heating period, the local mean\nstress will be reduced with consequent improvement in fatigue life relative to the heatwithout-load condition. The reverse will be true with compressive load with heating.\nIt may be noted that results for the notched specimen under long exposure times at\nlower temperatures, 20 000 hours at 1200 C, which have recently become available from\ntests for heat without load, confirm the appropriate pattern of behaviour. The results of\ntests on the pinned-lug specimens correspond to anticipated results, bearing in mind that\nthe crack-initiation period is a much smaller percentage of the fatigue life in this type of\nspecimen because fretting promotes early formation of surface cracks. As would therefore be anticipated, the effects of heat are considerably less in such specimens than in\nsimple notched specimens. The general patterns of behaviour observed in the foregoing\nfundamental studies have been shown also to apply to the observed behaviour of more com12\n\nplex specimens such as fabricated box beams containing riveted joints, cutouts, and so on.\nThis basic understanding will be of great help in the full-scale fatigue test, both in indicating areas of structure where heat is likely to promote relatively early initiation of\ndamage and in assessing the significance of failures that may develop.\nAcceleration of tests under combined thermal and mechanical cycles.- The third\ntype of investigation chosen to illustrate backup research and development work is concerned with the problem of accelerating the full-scale fatigue test, in which both thermal\nfatigue stresses and stresses arising from external loading actions contribute to the\ngrowth of fatigue damage. In order to keep the laboratory testing ahead of aircraft in\nservice, the full-scale fatigue test must be accelerated to accumulate fatigue damage\nmore rapidly than the real-time flight experience. This would present no problem if the\nloading actions were associated solely with externally applied mechanical loads because\nthe frequency of application of such loads could easily be speeded up relative to real-time\nexperience. It is the speeding up of the thermal-stress loading action that presents a\nproblem since hot and cold soak times, for example, are controlled by the heat-transfer\ncharacteristics of the structure and cannot be hastened simply. This problem is discussed in more detail subsequently.\nSome results of tests to give an assessment of one approach to this acceleration\nproblem are shown in figure 7. The acceleration technique explored in this case was to\nconduct the accelerated test using a wider temperature range than used in the "real-time"\ntest. The aim of this test was to attain the condition in which the increased range of the\nthermal-stress cycle would give twice the normal amount of fatigue damage in each test\ncycle. The accelerated test cycle included twice the number of mechanical loads experienced in one flight. Thus, each accelerated test cycle should give damage appropriate to\ntwo flights. The results given were obtained from tests on box beams (figs. 8 and 9)\nwhich were tested in four-point bending. The loading action applied resulted in mechanical and thermal stress conditions in the tension-compression surface of the specimen\ncorresponding to those in certain areas of the pressure cabin to which gust loadings,\ncabin pressurisation, the ground-to-air cycle, and thermal-gradients contribute. It\nshould be noted that in this exploratory work the severity of all the loadings was scaled\nup somewhat so that answers both in "real time" and accelerated conditions could be\nobtained in months rather than years. It will be seen from figure 7 that encouraging\nresults were obtained. Damage rate, assessed on the basis of the time to first crack,\nwas accelerated by a factor close to 2.\nThough only two specimens were tested in each condition at this stage, the indications were that scatter was low, and therefore the results could be treated with considerable confidence. Low scatter has been found to be a characteristic of much of the background research and development work entailing heat application. This preliminary work\n13\n\nis being followed up in a major programme of tests on box beams of similar dimensions\nbut of detail design representing much more closely the Concorde structure. The tests\nare being run in conditions corresponding closely to those envisaged both in service and\nin the full-scale test. In addition to providing information on acceleration conditions,\nanalysis of the results also provides understanding of the equivalence of thermal and\nmechanical stresses in cumulative damage.\nDESIGN DEVELOPMENT TESTS\nLarge Component Specimens\nQuite early in the design of an aircraft, it is prudent to build representative sections\nof the structure to see how ideas work out in practice. This is particularly necessary for\nthe supersonic transport aircraft with all the implications of the interaction of thermal\nand mechanical effects. Therefore, two sections of fuselage were built initially for the\nConcorde. Each had about a 15-foot length of representative structure. One was tested\nin France and the other in the United Kingdom (specimens 2.1 and 2.2 of fig. 10).\nAs the design took shape, actual components of the aircraft, such as parts of the\nwing and fuselage, have been made and are being tested to assist in design development.\nThese specimens make almost a complete aircraft. (See fig. 10.) Again, these tests are\nbeing shared with the French. A wide range of tests are being done on these component\nspecimens. They include the exploration of temperature and stress distributions under\nvarious design conditions, static tests to demonstrate the strength of the structure under\nextreme conditions, fatigue tests to show its behaviour under the recurring loads in service, and fail-safe tests to show that the structure is capable of withstanding safely damage or failures in service.\nFor this paper, two tests have been picked as examples of the work which has been\ncovered on the large component specimens.\nCentre Wing and Fuselage Specimen at C.E.A.T.\nSpecimen 2.813 (figs. 10 and 11) is a large section of the centre wing and fuselage\nand contains the important cutouts for the main undercarriage. It is an early prototype\nstandard and has completed its test programme at the Centre d\'Essais Aeronautique de\nToulouse (C.E.A.T.). It has been used to check the static strength of the aircraft and has\ngiven useful experience in preparation for the static test of the complete airframe, which\nis now being tested in the same laboratory.\nThe specimen weighed about 15 tons fully equipped and was approximately 35 feet\nlong with a span of 44 feet. Kinetic heating effects were simulated by the use of 5000\nradiant heaters, and cooling was simulated by ambient air and air cooled by liquid nitrogen\n14\n\ndrawn over the specimen at low speed by extractor fans. (See fig. 12.) The specimen\nwas equipped with 1500 strain-gauge points and 2000 thermocouples. The effect of fuel in\nthe tanks was simulated by using Gilotherm, a fluid which has similar characteristics to\nkerosene but is noninflammable. The mechanical loading was done with hydraulic jacks.\nOne of the earliest tests was to measure the influence coefficients across the specimen. Thence followed a thorough investigation of the strain and temperature distribution\nthroughout the structure under typical loading conditions. A number of design cases were\ntaken to limit load. The residual strength of the structure was demonstrated by removing\nmembers and unbolting joints to simulate fatigue and other damage. Finally in this group\nof tests, the wing was taken to ultimate load in a flight case. To see how far cracks propagated, the simulated fuselage was pressurised and struck with a guillotine blade; the\nimpact sites were such that the skin was cut between frames, or both the skin and a frame\nwere cut.\nForward-Fuselage Specimen at R.A.E.\nSpecimen 2.4/2.5 (figs. 10 and 13) is the forward part of the fuselage and is being\ntested at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E.). It is about 70 feet long and comprises the flight deck and forward part of the passenger cabin. The droop nose is included\nand also a dummy nose undercarriage. The specimen is made to preproduction standards.\nThe rig provides facilities for static, fatigue, and fail-safe tests and gives experience for\nthe fatigue test on the complete airframe which will use many of the same test techniques.\nThe specimen is cantilever mounted in the test frame at its aft end and is loaded by\n19 hydraulic jacks. It weighs about 8 tons fully equipped. Kinetic heating and cooling\neffects are simulated by convective means. Hot air is blown over the specimen to heat it\nfor the climb and cruise conditions, and cold air is blown over it to cool it for the descent\nand recovery conditions. The specimen is enclosed in a duct with about a 4-inch annular\ngap. The duct is articulated in sections on gimbals to allow for specimen movement.\nNormally, the specimen and duct are in a closed circuit in which the air can be heated by\nelectrical resistance heaters in the airflow or cooled by the injection of liquid nitrogen.\n(See fig. 14.) The circuit can however be opened to allow the specimen to be cooled initially with ambient air which has sufficient cooling potential for the first part of the\ndescent.\nThis method of convective heating and cooling was developed specially by the R.A.E.\nfor the component specimen tests and will be used for the major fatigue test. It provides\na very simple testing technique, and one which is inherently safe since rapid and dangerous temperature runaways are impossible. The principle used is that the heat-transfer\nconditions which are set up on the aircraft at high speed in the rarefied air at altitude can\nbe reproduced in the laboratory by blowing the denser air at ground level at slower speeds\n15\n\nand heating or cooling it to the required temperature. In this test a specimen temperature range of 150 0 C to -350 C can be achieved, and the maximum air speed required is\nabout 170 ft/sec. Control therefore is extremely simple; all that is necessary is to regulate the air speed and the air temperature. Good representation along and around the\nspecimen is obtained.\nThe cabin is pressurised and air-conditioned to represent the conditions in flight.\nAdditional electrical heaters are provided in the cabin to simulate the heat input from the\nelectronic equipment in the aircraft. The whole test is controlled by an interesting development of on-line computer control. Two KDF7 computers are used. The first controls\nthe test, by giving the instructions for mechanical loading, temperature, airflow, and so\nforth, against the required test programme; the second monitors the test by reproducing\nthe same programme and comparing the results achieved by the first computer. Two levels of discrepancy are identified. Those differences below the lower level are within the\nacceptable test tolerances and are ignored. Those between the lower and upper levels are\nprinted out so that the test control staff is informed. Any discrepancies above the upper\nlevel automatically cause the test to stop. By this method the test programme can be\nagreed upon, internationally, before it is commenced. High reliability is achieved because\nof the built-in checking systems and because elaborate recording with subsequent analysis\nis avoided.\nThe specimen is fitted with about 1400 strain-gauge points and 500 thermocouples.\nThe initial tests investigated the strain and temperature distributions throughout the\nstructure under typical loading cases. As a quick check on its integrity, the cabin structure was pressurised 5000 times. The specimen was then rigged for a fatigue test under\nthe full mechanical and thermal environment. The test was done on a flight-by-flight\nbasis, but each test cycle was made slightly more severe and shorter than aircraft flight\nconditions in order to shorten the testing time for a given amount of fatigue damage. The\nproblems associated with this are discussed more fully for the major fatigue test later in\nthis paper.\nThese tests were interrupted to obtain early design development information on the\nfail-safe behaviour of machined skin panels. Soon the specimen is to be modified to bring\nit up to production standards, and then it will be used for the certification fail-safe tests\non this part of the structure. In these tests, natural cracks or artificially induced cracks\n(or damage) will be propagated under the full environmental conditions for a given period,\nand then the specimen will be loaded to limit load to check its residual strength.\n\n16\n\nCERTIFICATION TESTS\nOutline of Programme\nWhen the aircraft has reached its production design standard, the aircraft must be\nshown to merit a Certificate of Airworthiness. Each country has its own certifying\nauthority, in the United Kingdom it is the Air Registration Board, and each country must\nbe satisfied that its particular regulations for this type of aircraft are met.\nIn the early days of the Concorde project, the French and British Governments\nagreed that the Concorde aircraft must qualify for both French and British Certificates of\nAirworthiness. The two airworthiness authorities therefore agreed jointly to produce new\nairworthiness requirements for supersonic transport aircraft which are now known as TSS\nstandards. These contain the parts of the French and British national requirements which\nwere applicable and such new requirements as were necessary to meet the special conditions arising for a supersonic transport aircraft. These TSS standards thus became the\nbasis for the design of the Concorde.\nThe United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has also produced a new\ndocument entitled "Tentative Airworthiness Standards for Supersonic Transports" (ref. 3).\nThese standards have also been taken into account in the Concorde design and test\nprogramme.\nCertification of the aircraft will be based partly on calculation, but most emphasis\nwill be placed on the major acceptance tests. Thus static, fatigue, and fail-safe tests are\nto be done on the whole airframe. The tests in more detail are\n(1) The major static test on a complete airframe less the nacelles at C.E.A.T.\n(France)\n(2) The major fatigue test on a complete airframe less the nacelles at R.A.E. (U.K.)\n(3) Static and fatigue tests on the nacelles at the British Aircraft Corporation (U.K.)\n(4) Drop tests, static, and fatigue tests on the nose and main undercarriages at\nC.E.A.T. (France)\n(5) Fail-safe tests on component specimens in the country of manufacture\nIn planning the acceptance test programme, it was necessary to select appropriate\nairframes from the manufacturing sequence. The first two airframes to be made were\nused for the two prototypes, 001 and 002. The third airframe was chosen for the major\nstatic test so that the test results would be available in time for the certification of the\naircraft. The airframe is to preproduction standard, and it was agreed that the test\nresults would be reinterpreted to take account of any differences between preproduction\nand production aircraft. The next two airframes to be made are being used for the preproduction flight aircraft, 01 and 02. The sixth airframe was chosen for the major fatigue\n17\n\ntest so that it should be closely representative of production standard and yet should be\navailable sufficiently early for the test to have started before the certification of the\naircraft.\nThe following paragraphs discuss the techniques and facilities used for the major\nstatic and major fatigue tests. Although the nacelle tests are not described in detail, the\nprocedures used to reproduce air pressure loading and convective heating and cooling are\nsimilar to those used for the major fatigue test. Finally, some comment is given on the\nfail-safe test programme, as Concorde will probably be the first aircraft to satisfy the\nnew FAA requirements for supersonic transport aircraft.\nMajor Static Test\nThe purpose of the static test is to show that the structure is capable of withstanding extreme conditions which might arise in service and has an adequate margin of\nstrength as laid down by the airworthiness authorities. A range of test cases has been\nselected to cover all the loading patterns which the aircraft will experience in service.\nThe tests have been grouped so that those without heating are done first. Currently, the\nspecimen is being rigged ready for the commencement of the hot tests.\nThe programme commenced with fuselage pressurisation tests and tests to check\nfuel-tank pressurisation and sealing. Then a number of tests were made to cover the\ntake-off and landing conditions. Two flight cases at the beginning of the climb \xe2\x80\x94 the\nsteady pullout case and the checked manoeuvre case \xe2\x80\x94 were also made. These tests were\nfollowed by a number of partial tests on local parts of the specimen covering various conditions arising from the nose undercarriage, tail bumper, engine loads, fin, flight controls,\nand the main undercarriage doors. In the next phase, the whole specimen will be subjected\nto the cases which are critical with the thermal cycle, such as a manoeuvre at the end of\nthe climb, a pull-out at the end of the cruise, and gusts during the descent.\nThis large and comprehensive test is being made at C.E.A.T. in a test facility built\nfor the Concorde tests. (See fig. 15.) The main test hall has a strong floor with underfloor ducts for cables, hydraulic pipes, and so forth. Portal frames provide support for\nthe overhead and side loading. The loads are applied by hydraulic jacks, servocontrolled\nby Moog valves from a computer. Forty-eight separately controlled loading channels are\navailable, and each can control more than one jack if required. Double-bridge load cells\nare used to control and monitor the loads.\nThe kinetic heating effect will be simulated by radiant heaters supplied by thyratron\nregulators controlled by the computer. One hundred and fifty channels are available, some\nof 200 kVA and some of 50 kVA capability. Air will be blown over the specimen at about\n20 ft/sec during the heating phase, and increased to about 50 ft/sec in the cooling phase.\nCooling will be obtained by the injection of liquid nitrogen into the airstream. The cabin\n18\n\nwill be pressurised, air conditioned, and filled with polyurethane foam blocks to reduce\nthe explosive risk.\nThe digital computer controls the sequencing of the whole test and also records the\ntest data. Some 2000 strain gauges and 1500 thermocouples are installed on the specimen, and about 2000 selected inputs can be recorded and processed by the computer in\nreal time. The transducer data are printed every 10 seconds to detect any transducers\nwhich may be outside of expected limits.\nThe load in each test case is built up in a series of steps in the usual way, and full\nuse is made of the computer to examine strains and deflections at each step and to compare them with expected values. It is hoped by this means to be able to detect the onset\nof failure and to stop the test before catastrophic damage occurs. The inclusion of kinetic\nheating and cooling in the static tests produces problems of sequencing. For example, it\nwould not be satisfactory to hold the specimen at a high load for a long period while the\nthermal cycle was applied. It would also be very time consuming to perform a thermal\ncycle for every load level in every case. Thus an optimum sequence is being worked out\nfor conducting the tests. Care has been taken to install in the specimen strain gauges and\nthermocouples at corresponding points to those on the flight-test aircraft so that full comparison can be made of conditions measured in flight and reproduced in the test laboratory.\nThe test will be completed before certification of the aircraft. All the important\nstatic design conditions will have been covered, and the tests will demonstrate that the airframe is capable of withstanding extreme conditions which might arise in service.\nMajor Fatigue Test\nThe purpose of the fatigue test is to subject the specimen to the whole structural\nload environment the aircraft would experience in service. The specimen is taken through\na series of flight sequences in the laboratory and subjected to the environmental conditions\nit would encounter in typical flights. These conditions include the external loading actions,\nsuch as taxying loads, take-off loads, gust loads, kinetic heating and cooling, and the internal loading actions, such as cabin pressurisation, air-conditioning, and fuel handling.\nThese loading actions must be applied to the specimen flight after flight to build up in the\nspecimens all the fatigue structural experience which the aircraft will accumulate in\nservice.\nBy their very nature, fatigue tests must take a long time. However, for subsonic\naircraft, it has always been possible to compress the loading actions so that a test cycle\nin the laboratory was considerably shorter than the flight it represented. The problem is\nvery much more difficult for a supersonic transport aircraft, since the effects of the\nthermal cycle are time dependent. Nonetheless, it is essential to find a way to shorten\nthe test time so that the tests may keep ahead of aircraft in service with an adequate\n19\n\nsafety margin. The fatigue lives of nominally identical structures are often quite different. Consequently, the Concorde tests are designed so that the specimen will always\nhave at least three times as much fatigue damage (or three times the equivalent loads\nand thermal cycles) as any aircraft in service. In order to do this, the test must be\naccelerated, that is, it must represent the aircraft conditions in a shorter time. The test\nwill be run 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, but there will need to be pauses to inspect\nthe specimen and to maintain it, for the essence of this test is to find the fatigue damage\nwhile it is still very small so that early preventive measures can be applied to the aircraft in service.\nIn this part of the paper, broad details only are given of the test techniques and procedures. These are amplified considerably and the practical problems discussed subsequently. The test is being done in the structural test laboratories at R.A.E. (See figs. 16,\n17, and 18.) Mechanical loading is being applied by hydraulic jacks. Convective heating\nand cooling is being used to simulate the external thermal conditions. Because of the\nneed to shorten the time of the test, additional forced heating and cooling systems are\nneeded for the internal structure and the fuel. All this requires a considerable amount\nof plant to provide the heat and the cold. The test itself and the plant are controlled by\ntwo process computers and one monitor computer with a data logging and display system.\nCurrently the construction of the specimen in the test frame is about complete, and\nthe test rig is being installed. When all this has been completed, the assembly will be\ncalibrated initially by running a number of flight cycles in real time and comparing the\nachieved strains and temperatures with those measured in corresponding positions in\nflight. The problem then of accelerating the test will be tackled by shortening the test\ncycle and by making each test cycle represent more than one flight. This acceleration\nwill be taken in steps, working down from the real-time cycle to ensure that the accelerated test cycle is meaningful. The chosen aim is to do each test cycle in 60 minutes and\nto make it represent two supersonic flights. Interspersed in the pattern of hot test cycles\nwill be some without the thermal cycle to represent the subsonic flights which are\nexpected to total about 20 percent of the service experience. The use of computer control ensures overall flexibility in the test, and advantage will be taken of this to vary the\ntest cycles as appropriate to represent flight in different degrees of turbulence, at different gross weights, and with different flight patterns.\nThe engineering tasks involved in this test are considerable. The specimen weighs\nabout 40 tons and the fuel about twice this amount. This entire mass has to be heated and\ncooled through the appropriate temperature range of each test cycle. Two major plants\nare required, one for external heating and cooling and the other for internal heating and\ncooling with all the special forcing systems included. The duct over the specimen is itself a major piece of engineering design. Then there is the mechanical loading system\nwhich must be capable of applying a multiple range of loads in a relatively short time.\n20\n\nFinally, the overall control system for the test must itself have high integrity and be able\nto control and monitor all functions so that the test as a whole achieves high reliability\nwith safety.\nSpecial attention has been paid to the need for extreme reliability of all parts of the\nrig, and wherever possible, well proven designs and techniques have been used. The\ntests will be continued for many years over many thousands of cycles to represent the\nservice life of the aircraft with adequate margins. It is imperative therefore that the rig\nshould be trouble free so that the only interruptions in the testing programme are for\ninspection and repair of the specimen.\nWhile the equipment for the test is impressive, the technical judgement which lies\nbehind it is more significant. The test must be meaningful. It must be possible to interpret the failures and apply preventive measures to aircraft in service. Much is being\nlearned now from the research and development programme to give the necessary basis\nfor this technical judgement. It is planned that the test will start before certification of\nthe aircraft. The test specimen will then keep well ahead of the aircraft in service and\nwill give practical demonstration that the airframe is capable of withstanding the recurring loads which make up its service experience.\nFail-Safe Tests\nThe Anglo-French TSS standards (ref. 4) call for analysis and substantiating tests\nto demonstrate the fail-safe characteristics of the structure. The tests are to be taken\nto limit load in combination with appropriate temperature effects and normal cabin operating pressure, if applicable.\nThe American FAA standards (ref. 3) go a little further than this. They require\nthat all primary structure shall be designed fail-safe and that it shall be shown that adequate residual strength is provided to ensure that any partial failure will be detected\nbefore a hazardous condition develops. This involves showing that the structure remains\ncapable of supporting the expected repeated loading and temperature spectrum and critical\ndesign limit loads without catastrophic results during the period after any fatigue failure\nor partial failure has progressed to obvious proportions and prior to detection by inspection. The intention is to cover the situation in which cracks or accidental damage might\noccur immediately following an inspection and then remain undetected in service until the\nnext inspection, during which period they might be subjected to limit load. Thus, in a\nfail-safe test, it is necessary to cut the structure to simulate damage or to grow a crack,\nthen to subject it to fatigue loads under the full environmental conditions for the equivalent\nof an inspection period, during which the damage may propagate, and then to show that it\nwill withstand limit load. The results of these tests are required for type certification.\n\n21\n\nThis fail-safe testing involves quite a large test programme to cover all aspects of\nthe structure. The tests too are complex and time consuming because fatigue testing\nunder full environmental conditions is required. For Concorde, it is planned to do these\ntests on the major component specimens, supplemented where necessary by tests on\nsmaller specimens to cover design changes made since these specimens were made.\nThus results will be available for type certification. In addition, check tests will be made\non the major fatigue test specimen towards the end of its programme. These check tests,\nof course, will be made after the initial Certificate of Airworthiness tests are completed,\nbut it is not thought practical to mix fail-safe tests with the major fatigue test, as the\napplications of limit load to check residual strength, necessary for the fail-safe tests,\ncould affect crack initiation in the fatigue test.\nTHERMAL CYCLE IN MAJOR FATIGUE TEST\nImportant Thermal Effects in Fatigue Test\nBefore going into the practical details of how this test is to be done for the Concorde,\nan examination of why a fatigue test is to be done at all and what the main parameters are\nwhich dictate its complexity is appropriate.\nA fatigue test is a firm requirement of the British and French certifying authorities.\nThey specifically state in the TSS standards (ref. 4) that "A full scale complete airframe\nfatigue test programme shall be carried out under representative loading, pressure, heating, and cooling conditions." There is good reason for this. Experience, over many\nyears, has shown that the fatigue test can reveal unexpected weaknesses and enable corrective action to be taken early, thus preserving safety. In safe-life designs, the fatigue\ntest can reveal failures which would not have been found by inspection until they had\nbecome catastrophic. In fail-safe designs, the fatigue test shows where to make the\ninspections and gives guidance on their frequency, based on the rate of crack propagation.\nIt has even been known to show that some structures designed to be fail-safe had unexpected weaknesses with safe-life characteristics. Thus it is extremely desirable for a\nfail-safe structure to be fatigue tested for its full life with an adequate factor to cover the\npossibility of unexpected safe-life failures. As well as the safety aspect, the early knowledge of possible fatigue damage in service has important warranty considerations.\nHaving established that a fatigue test shall be done, there is no doubt that the best\nand most up-to-date methods of simulation of the mechanical loads must be used, and this\nis no real difficulty with modern servo-hydraulic loading systems and on-line computer\ncontrol. The major question, which governs the complexity of the test, is the manner in\nwhich it is necessary to include the thermal effects in order to do a meaningful test.\nThere are a number of significant thermal effects including\n22\n\n(1) The thermal stress loading cycle produced by the thermal cycle, that is, heating\nand cooling each flight\n(2) Creep arising from prolonged time at temperature under load\n(3) Overageing arising from prolonged time at temperature and giving a reduction\nof static strength\n(4) The interaction of all these thermal effects on each other and on the fatigue\nbehaviour of the structure under mechanical loads.\nOf these, the first is of overriding importance in determining if or how the thermal effects\nshould be included in the test. Also intermittent heating is probably important because of\nits interaction effect on fatigue behaviour under mechanical loads.\nIt was shown previously that the difference in internal and external structural temperatures arising from the supersonic climb to altitude produced a thermal stress, which\ndied away as the structural temperature equalised during the cruise. The process was\nrepeated during the descent, giving rise to a thermal stress of the opposite sign. These\nthermal stresses are likely to be characteristic of all supersonic transport aircraft having\na long range and to be an important part of the fatigue-loading environment. For the\nConcorde they are of comparable magnitude to the direct stress. They cannot therefore\nbe ignored in a fatigue test. They might be simulated by mechanical means, but although\nthis may be feasible in simple specimens, it is not thought to be practicable in the complex structure of a complete airframe. By their very nature, thermal stresses arise\nfrom the differential expansion or contraction of adjacent structure and have a varying\npattern throughout the structure depending upon the temperature differences set up with\ntime. It therefore is regarded as essential that the thermal stresses should be obtained\nin the fatigue test by the application of the thermal cycles.\nThe other thermal effects then need to be fitted into the test cycle. Not all of these\nnecessarily involve intermittent heating and cooling for adequate representation. But they\nshould be included in the test somehow, and can be included more easily if the thermal\ncycle is applied in the test. More details about thermal effects are given in the following\nsections where the problem of accelerating the test is considered.\nAccelerating the Test\nConcorde is being designed to have a service life of 45 000 hours. The maximum\nutilisation for any particular aircraft is expected to be between 3000 and 4000 hours per\nyear. Now, as mentioned previously, the aim is to run the fatigue test so that the specimen will always have achieved at least three times the fatigue life of any aircraft in service. This factor of three allows for the scatter in fatigue performance between nominally\n\n23\n\nidentical structures, and allows for the variation between the test specimen and service\naircraft. Hence, as much as 12 000 hours of flying may need to be represented in a year.\nHowever, there are only 8760 hours in a year, and even by testing 24 hours per day,\n7 days a week, it is unlikely that more than 4000 hours of actual test running can be\nachieved as time must be allowed for inspection of the specimen, maintenance, and so\nforth. Thus, the test has to be accelerated by a factor of approximately three, and it\nwould be prudent to achieve rather better than this to allow provision for long delays\nwhich would inevitably occur if a major failure took place in the test.\nNormally, it is quite a simple matter to accelerate a fatigue test as the mechanical\nload effects are amenable to grouping and can be represented in a much shorter time in\nthe test than in a flight. This grouping has become a well-established technique, although\nsome workers have slight doubts whether it would not be better to include more dwell\nperiods between loading than is currently done. It is much more difficult to accelerate a\ntest cycle including thermal effects because most of these effects are time dependent.\nThe present plan is to accelerate the hot test cycle in two ways:\n(1) By making each thermal cycle as fatigue damaging as two supersonic flights\n(2) By shortening the thermal cycle to as near 60 minutes as practicable.\nIn planning the fatigue test, it has been assumed that\n(1) The average length of a supersonic flight is 2.5 hours.\n(2) The average length of a subsonic flight is 1.0 hour.\n(3) On the average the ratio of supersonic flights to subsonic flights is 4 to 1.\nThe current plan is to run the fatigue test in a sequence of two hot test cycles and one cold\ntest cycle. The hot test cycle will represent two supersonic flights and will contain one\naccelerated thermal cycle equivalent to two supersonic flights and two groups of mechical loads each equivalent to one flight. The cold test cycle will contain all the mechanical\nloads equivalent to one flight. The aim is to do the hot cycle in 60 minutes and the cold\ncycle in 15 minutes. If this is achieved then the sequence of two hot cycles and one cold\ncycle will take 2.25 hours and represent four supersonic flights plus one subsonic flight\ntaking 11 hours. Thus, the time has been compressed by a factor of almost five.\nWithin this broad format, the individual test cycles will take account of flights in\ndifferent degrees of turbulence, at different gross weights, and for different flight patterns.\nNo test, however complicated, can provide a perfect representation for all aircraft in service, and a means of interpretation is necessary to relate the test results to service as\npreviously mentioned.\nShortening the hot cycle brings a number of tricky problems to fit all the mechanical\nloadings into the time available, especially as each of these cycles is to represent two\n24\n\nflights. Basically, the plan is to associate one set of mechanical loadings with their\nappropriate place in the test cycle and then to add another set towards the end of the cycle\nwhile the specimen is recovering temperature equilibrium ready for the next test cycle.\n(See fig. 19.) The alternative plan would have been to have put in one set of mechanical\nloadings, but at a higher level to take account of the acceleration. This plan was rejected\nhowever, mainly because of the possible unrepresentative effect on crack propagation.\nThe time available for mechanical loading thus becomes critical in the shortened\ncycle; and therefore, great care needs to be taken in choosing the levels of loads to be\nused, particularly within the taxi and gust load spectra. Especially, it is necessary to\nensure that sufficient small loads are applied to reproduce the effects of fretting, even\nthough these small loads take a disproportionate testing time compared with their direct\ncontribution to the fatigue damage. The computer-controlled hydraulic servo-loading system gives great freedom of choice of loading levels, and full advantage can be taken of this\nto pick an optimum combination of frequencies and levels.\nAnother advantage arising from this flexibility is that random loading can be used if\ndesired. Random loading, of course, more nearly represents what happens in service, and\nits use reduces the number of assumptions necessary in setting up the test programme. A\npossible disadvantage is that it might make it more difficult to trace the progress of failures on the fracture surfaces. Some work is currently in hand to investigate this in laboratory specimens and also the possibility of arranging the random loading to include\nmarker loads which could be found on the subsequent fracture. Certainly, it is an advantage to be able to trace the progress of a fracture, but experience shows that this is often\nnot possible except in simple loading cases and advantages of random loading may well\noutweigh the disadvantage which might arise in this particular aspect.\nAccelerated Thermal Cycle\nAs previously mentioned the thermal cycle is to be accelerated by making it represent more than one flight and by shortening it. The most important part of the thermal\ncycle is the representation of the thermal stress, although the effects of creep and overageing and of their interactions are not to be ignored. The thermal stress arises from\ndifferential expansion due to the temperature difference between the skin and the internal\nstructure. This stress is proportional to the temperature difference, and hence by\nincreasing this difference a corresponding increase in thermal stress is obtained. This\nincrease, in turn, is related to life through the appropriate S-N relationship, and an\nincrease in temperature range can be chosen to give in one test cycle the fatigue damage\nfrom thermal stress approximately equivalent to that occurring in two supersonic flights.\nFor illustration, a simple example of a hypothetical piece of deep structure which\nfollows certain assumed conditions will be considered. In particular, it is assumed that\n25\n\n\t\n\nthe skin and the deep structure start the climb at the same temperature and that the deep\nstructure has warmed up only negligibly by the time the skin temperature has reached its\ncruise value. This would then give the condition for maximum thermal stress. It is also\nassumed that similar conditions apply for the descent. The comparison then becomes\nReal time\t\nTest\nconditions conditions\nThermal stress due to climb:\nSkin and deep structure temperature at start of climb, \xc2\xb0C . \t\nSkin temperature at end of climb, \xc2\xb0C . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\nDeep structure temperature at end of climb, \xc2\xb0C . . . . . . \t\nSkin temperature range, 0 C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\nIncrease in skin-temperature range over real-time conditions,\n\npe rcent\n\n15\t\n100\t\n15\t\n85\t\n\n22\n130\n22\n108\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n27\n\n\tThermal-cycle time-compression factor . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\n--2\n\nThermal stress due to descent:\nSkin and deep structure temperature at start of descent,\no C\t\n\tMinimum skin temperature during descent, 0 C . . . . . . .\t\nDeep structure temperature at same time, \xc2\xb0C . . . . . . .\t\nSkin temperature range, o C . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\nIncrease in skin-temperature range over real-time conditions,\npercent. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\t\n\tThermal-cycle time-compression factor . . . . . . . . . . \t\n\n100\t\n\n130\n\n-20\t\n100\t\n120\t\n\n-25\n130\n155\n29\n\n^2\n\nThe example is imprecise because clearly all the assumed conditions are not exactly\nmet. Nonetheless, it illustrates that practical test conditions can be found which for deep\nstructure will enable the thermal cycle to be accelerated by approximately two, that is, to\nrepresent two real flights. Clearly, a wide range of test conditions could be chosen to\nachieve this effect. The particular combination of a top temperature of 130 o C, a bottom\ntemperature of -25 0 C, and an ambient temperature of 22 0 C is a reasonable compromise\non plant requirements, consistent with minimum effect on material properties of the specimen, particularly at elevated temperature. There are, of course, varying depths of deep\nstructure throughout the aircraft. Because only one external temperature distribution can\nconveniently be prescribed for the whole aircraft, each portion of the structure will experience a different acceleration, depending upon its depth within the total structure.\nA similar approach to accelerate the conditions for shallow structure is possible by\nincreasing rates of heating and cooling, and a useful compromise is to cover the new tem-\n\n26\n\nperature range in the original time. Again the resulting acceleration pattern is not uniform throughout the structure.\nThe second part of the problem is what can be done to shorten the test cycle. It has\nalready been said that the most important reason for including the thermal cycle is to\nrepresent the thermal stresses, and for these it is important to represent the climb and\ndescent phases in approximately real time. Thus, the only hope for shortening the test\ncycle lies in shortening the cruise and recovery phases. There are however two important constraints, namely, that the structural temperatures must be correct at the start of\nthe climb and at the start of the descent so that the conditions are right for the generation\nof the thermal stress. If these conditions can be achieved artificially, the cruise and\nrecovery phases can be shortened. Incidentally, a shorter cruise at higher temperature\nis compatible with maintaining the correct creep and overageing damage rates.\nIn cruise, the important criterion is that the structure reaches the conditions at the\nend of the cruise phase before the descent phase is started. Shallow structure will follow\nquite closely the temperature of the skin. Deeper structure will lag behind because of the\ntime it takes for the heat to be conducted to it. The amount of lag will vary considerably\nthroughout the structure. Most of the structure will, however, have reached a stable temperature by the end of the cruise phase. The problem, therefore, of shortening the cruise\nphase is to identify the structure which will not have reached a stable temperature in the\nshortened time and to force heat it in the test so that it does. The forced heating can be\nstarted as soon as the peak thermal stress has been reached in the climb. This peak\nwill be reached at the end of the climb for deep structure and earlier for shallow\nstructure.\nSimilar arguments for forced cooling apply to the shortening of the recovery phase.\nForced cooling can be started as soon as the peak thermal stress has been reached; the\npeak thermal stress occurs at or before the time at which the skin reaches its minimum\ntemperature. The situation is complicated by the fact that the final ambient temperature\nis higher than the skin temperature and lower than the temperature of the bulk of internal\nstructure. Therefore, the forcing potentials are less than those obtained at the end of the\ncruise. The forced heating and cooling is being done by circulating hot and cold air and\nhot and cold fuel and is an extremely complex process.\nFor Concorde the chosen aim is to do the complete test cycle in 60 minutes, made\nup approximately of take-off and climb, 11 minutes; cruise, 20 minutes; descent and landing, 9 minutes; and recovery, 20 minutes. Initially test cycles will be run in real time,\nand results compared with measurements in flight. These have become known as "witness\ntests." Tests under accelerated conditions will then be made with the cycle time gradually\nbeing reduced, but ensuring always that the shortened test cycle remains meaningful. A\ncomparison of the proposed accelerated thermal cycle with the flight cycle is shown in\nfigure 20.\n27\n\nInterpreting the Test\nThe presence of the thermal cycle adds a number of difficulties in interpreting the\ntest. For the fatigue test of a subsonic aircraft, numerous simplifying assumptions have\nto be made to set up the test, and means have to be devised to interpret the failures and\nto apply them to aircraft whose service history differs from the loading spectra used in\nthe test. All this is still necessary for the supersonic transport aircraft. There is, however, the added complication of the thermal cycle and of the compromises which have been\nnecessary to include it in the test.\nIt has already been shown that compression of test time, that is, increasing the\nthermal stress damage in each test cycle, produces a nonuniform thermal-cycle timecompression factor throughout the structure. Even though the nominal value of this compression factor is 2, it is necessary to be able to calculate the actual value at any place\nwhere a failure occurs or at other points of interest.\nThe principle of the accelerated cycle is to increase the magnitude of the thermal\nstress so that less cycles are applied and time can be saved; however, these increased\nthermal stresses have to be combined with the direct mechanical stresses. In fact, the\nthermal stress can be regarded as a shift of mean stress for the alternating mechanical\nstresses since it is a slowly varying stress from zero to a maximum in one direction,\nthrough zero to a maximum in the opposite direction, finally returning to zero again. In\norder not to raise the peak stresses to too high an unrepresentative value, it was decided\nto apply the mechanical loads (real level) twice during the test cycle to compensate for\nthe acceleration of the thermal cycle. This is a complex situation. Increased thermal\nstresses are being combined with mechanical stresses at real-aircraft level. At any particular point in the structure, the proportions of thermal and mechanical stress damage\nmay not be correct since the mechanical cycles are being applied overall on the assumption of a nominal value of thermal-cycle time-compression factor of 2 whereas the actual\nvalue at that point may be different.\nIt is important that under these special conditions the form of failure should not be\naltered, or if it is, the difference should be recognised. To this end, the box tests and\nother backup research tests are being made to explore modes of failure, times to failure,\nand crack-propagation rates under combinations of mechanical and thermal stress and\nunder real and accelerated conditions.\nFortunately, shortening the thermal cycle in association with accelerating the rate\nof thermal-stress damage results in the application of higher temperatures in the cruise\nfor shorter times. Thus, in part, some automatic compensation is given for the creep\nand overageing effects, but these need to be calculated in detail throughout the structure\nto determine how much the structural properties are being changed from each of these\ncauses and comparison made with real aircraft conditions.\n28\n\nTherefore, the need to assess the cumulative damage under all of these conditions\nand relate it to aircraft conditions so that test damage can be interpreted is great. The\nprocess for correcting fatigue-test results for different service conditions is now well\nestablished for subsonic aircraft. Basically, this correction depends upon the application\nof Miner\'s law to critical parts of the structure. To this process must now be added the\nthermal stress and the interaction effects of the thermal cycle, creep, and overageing on\nthe mechanical stress. Preliminary methods are being tried and verification sought from\nthe research programme.\nHEATING AND COOLING FOR THE MAJOR FATIGUE TEST\nExternal Heating and Cooling\nThe purpose of external heating and cooling is to apply to the specimen the kinetic\nheating which the aircraft receives in the supersonic climb and cruise and the cooling\nwhich results from the descent at subsonic speeds. (See fig. 4.) The heating and the\ncooling is being done convectively with air, which is blown over the specimen at the\nrequired temperature and at suitable speeds so that the heat-transfer coefficients experienced in flight are reproduced in the test laboratory. The specimen is enclosed in a\nthermal duct which is divided into five sections, one over the fuselage and one over and\nunder each of the two wings. There are five closed circuits linking these sections to the\nheating and cooling plant. Closed circuits are used so that the air can be recirculated\nand the heating and cooling potential conserved. Each circuit contains a fan to circulate\nthe air and heat exchangers to heat and cool it.\nThermal duct.- Initially it was intended that the thermal duct should totally enclose\nthe specimen. Later for reasons of expediency, it was decided not to heat and cool the\nwing tips and the upper part of the fin. The justification for not heating and cooling these\nareas is that the thermal stresses in them are low, and what effects there are can be\nassessed by reading across from areas of similar structure which are being subjected to\nthe thermal cycle. The most important advantage is that this exclusion enables a rigid\nduct to be used since the specimen deflections can be contained within the duct spacing\nfrom the specimen. The duct can therefore be supported by rigging from the structure of\nthe laboratory. Some flow-restriction problems arise because of the specimen deflections, but these are small compared with the problems that would have arisen from the\ndesign and construction of a flexible duct or a duct with flexible joints. Even so the\ndesign of the duct is still a major engineering task. This duct has to be easily removable\nso that the specimen can be inspected at frequent intervals. It has to be airtight when\nclosed to avoid large losses of hot and cold air. It has to have a minimum of thermal\nmass so that it does not absorb heat and cold from the airstream in an unnecessarily\n\n29\n\nwasteful manner. It must, of course, be able to withstand the effects of the continuous\nrepetition of the thermal cycle.\nAs mentioned, the overall aircraft duct is divided into five main sections which are\neffectively in parallel \xe2\x80\x94 one over the fuselage and one over and under each wing. The\nwing ducts are further subdivided; the upper-surface duct splits into four parallel\nbranches to cater for spanwise variation of heat-transfer coefficient, and the lowersurface duct splits initially into four branches which merge into three in order to bypass\nthe engine nacelle. The fuselage duct is an annulus up to the wing leading edge, where it\nsplits into two branches, a horseshoe sectioned upper duct and an approximately rectangular sectioned lower duct. The two ducts continue along the fuselage and rejoin at the\nwing trailing edge. Near the fin leading edge, a divider takes some of the air from the\nupper duct and passes it over the lower portion of the fin before rejoining the fuselage\ncircuit in the return trunking. The ducts are shown diagrammatically in figures 21\nand 22.\nFor each wing, the upper- and lower-surface ducts join at the trailing edge to form\na plenum chamber with a static pressure common to both ducts. The return trunking for\nthe two circuits is connected to the plenum chamber, and a short distance from the chamber the lower-surface duct trunking is provided with a vent to the atmosphere. The vent\ndictates the position of atmospheric static pressure in the circuits and allows the circuits\nto breathe during temperature changes. To prevent an increasing concentration of airborne fuel simulant in the circuits due to small fuel leakages, the circuits are constantly\npurged through the vent by bleeding fresh air into the circuits at appropriate positions.\nThere are three vents, one for each wing and one for the fuselage. Provision is made for\nthe insertion of suitable gauges in the three outer ducts of each wing circuit forward of\nthe leading edge to adjust the mass flows in the ducts, and vane dampers are fitted in all\nducts at the trailing edge for fine adjustment. Similarly, for the fuselage circuit, vane\ndampers are fitted in the upper duct and small fin duct.\nThe duct depths are designed to give the required heat-transfer coefficients from\nthe Dittus and Boelter equation\nNusselt number = 0.023(Reynolds number) 0.8 (Prandtl number)0.4\nwith the overriding condition that the deflected aircraft structure shall not foul the duct.\nAverage duct depths are fuselage, 7 inches; wing upper, 8 inches; and wing lower,\n16 inches. The depth of the wing ducts is adjustable over a 3-inch range so,that the ducts\ncan be tuned to give the right temperature response in the fore and aft direction. The\nfuselage ducts also are adjustable but only in a vertical direction.\n30\n\nThe duct is mounted on a massive steel structure with chordwise beams and spanwise intercostals bridging the specimen. Much of the duct is made up of a large number\nof removable panels constructed of aluminium alloy. These fit onto the beams and intercostals of the supporting structure and react to the loading due to the duct internal pressure. The duct panels and the fixed duct structure are insulated from the airflow on their\ninner surface by insulation panels attached to them. The insulant is a semirigid slab of\nmineral wool completely enclosed in a seam-welded stainless steel skin 0.010 inch thick\nto form insulating panels 1.25 inches thick around the aircraft and 1.75 inches thick in the\ninlet and exhaust ducts. The insulation panels are sealed to prevent ingress of fuel simulant which can be present within the duct in liquid and vapour form due to leakage from\nthe specimen.\nSince the aircraft moves relative to the duct, the chordwise walls separating the\nducts from each other are flexible and constructed to extend and compress like an accordion. (See fig. 23.) The upper surface walls are coincident with chordwise rows of wingload application rods which are used to give the walls lateral stability. The lower surface walls have built-in lateral stability since there are fewer loading rods attached to\nthe lower surface. Sliding seals are provided where the wing tips protrude from the duct.\nThe structure carrying the seal is counterpoised and follows the wing movements.\nThe fin duct is the only portion of duct not fixed relative to the floor. It is attached\nto the fuselage duct by a flexible seal and is moved vertically in step with the fin movement by means of hydraulic jacks with a self-contained hydraulic supply and control unit.\nWith both fin and duct moving together, the problem of passing fin lateral loading rods\nthrough the duct is eased considerably.\nAn essential requirement of the duct is that it shall be easily removable for inspection of the specimen. To this end the duct panels are fitted with quick release devices,\nand as far as possible, the loading rods are passed through the joints between the panels.\nNonetheless, removing the panels is still a very large task since there are about 80\naround the fuselage, 32 above the wings, and 60 below the wings. Those on the fuselage\nare mainly removable, and those on the wing are mainly hinged.\nAnother major problem for the duct is the passing through it of the service pipes\ncarrying air and fuel substitute to provide the internal heating, cooling, and pressurisation. There are some 100 of these pipes ranging in diameter from 4 to 14 inches. Many\nof these pipes pass through the lower fuselage duct and have a masking effect on the fuselage structure. They also increase the pressure drop through the duct considerably. In\nsome cases it has been possible to group the pipes together and to shroud them with an\naerodynamic fairing to reduce the interference to the airstream. There is a difficulty of\nsealing these pipes to the duct to avoid leakage and yet to allow movement of the pipes with\nthe specimen as it deflects in the duct. Some pipes are fitted with corrugated fabric fairings to accommodate the movement and reduce the pressure drop and air leakage. For\n31\n\nothers, clearance holes are filled with a sliding-plate device, which shows a relatively\nsmooth surface to the airstream.\nThe temperature of the air and its mass flow are varied throughout the test cycle\nto give as near as possible the correct heat-transfer coefficient to match the corresponding flight conditions. The temperature of the air is regulated by the flow of fluids to the\nheat exchangers and the mass flow by adjusting the speed of the circulating fans. The\nheat-transfer coefficients vary during the different phases of the flight and a compromise\nhas to be achieved on the rig mainly because, once it has been set up, there is a fixed\ngeometrical relationship between the duct and the specimen. The duct panels are individually adjustable on their supports so that duct depths can be altered locally, thereby\nenabling the duct to be tuned to give the best overall compromise along the length of the\nspecimen for the chosen air temperature and mass flow. Some experience of this has\nalready been gained on the forward fuselage specimen, as mentioned previously, and it is\nconfidently expected that good temperature distributions along and around the specimen\nwill be achieved.\nExternal heating and cooling plant.- The primary heating and cooling plant consists\nbasically of the following equipment:\n(1) Axial-flow fans to circulate the air\n(2) Heat exchangers to heat and cool the air\n(3) Boilers and refrigerators for producing the hot and cold fluids\n(4) Storage vessels for all the fluids\n(5) Multitudinous pumps, control valves, and piping to distribute the fluids.\nA simplified flow diagram of the plant is shown in figure 24. The plant generates hot and\ncold fluids continuously, and these are stored in large vessels to be transferred to the\nheat exchangers as required.\nSome idea of the magnitude of the task can be gained from the facts that the structural specimen itself weighs about 40 tons and the fuel substitute about twice this amount.\nThese specimens have to be taken through the appropriate temperature ranges approximately once every hour. This thermal cycling is, however, only part of the work which\nthe plant has to do; since in circulating the air, the thermal duct, return trunking, and\nassociated equipment are all cycled through the appropriate temperature ranges. Even\nthough these are insulated as carefully as possible, they add up to the equivalent of about\nfive more specimens.\nThe axial-flow air-circulating fan in each of the five circuits is fitted with adjustable inlet guide vanes and downstream air-straightening vanes and delivers about\n3200 ft 3 /sec of air. The fan drive is through a shaft connected to a 2000-hp variable32\n\nspeed motor situated outside the circuit. The inlet guide vanes are set to give the best\nfan efficiency for the particular circuit-flow conditions. The total airflow in all five circuits is about 1250 lb/sec. The maximum air velocity is about 150 ft/sec. The fans also\nprovide a considerable input of heat to the air. This heat input assists during the heating\nphase but is an embarrassment during the cooling phase, requiring additional cooling\ncapacity from the plant to compensate for it. It may even need to be compensated for in\npart during the cruise if the heat input from the fans proves to be greater than the heat\nlosses of the circuits.\nThe heat-exchanger fluids are water and ammonia, which are each stored at two\ndifferent temperatures: water at 180 0 C and 5 0 C and ammonia at -62 0 C and 35 0 C.\nThere are two heat exchangers in each air circuit, one for water and the other for ammonia. The water heat exchanger, immediately downstream of the fan, heats or cools the\nair when supplied with water at 180 0 C or 50 C, respectively. The ammonia heat\nexchanger supplies the cooling necessary to produce below-zero air temperatures and is\nso constructed that air can either flow through or bypass the exchanger matrix elements.\nThe eleven elements of the heat exchanger are mounted one above the other with ten intervening gaps. Hydraulically operated shutters over the element inlets and gaps are so\narranged that when the element shutters are open, the gap shutters are closed, making\nthe air go through the elements. With the element shutters closed and the gap shutters\nopen, the heat exchanger is virtually bypassed. The ammonia heat exchanger is bypassed\nwhenever the circuit contains hot air; this bypass reduces the loss of heat into the\nexchanger mass, and in addition, the heat-exchanger mass is kept at a constant temperature by flowing ammonia at 35 0 C through its elements.\nIt is extremely important that the air leaving the heat exchangers and entering the\nthermal duct shall be uniformly heated or cooled over its cross section. The fluid flow\nacross the heat exchangers has been specially designed with this in mind. In addition, the\nfluid in the heat exchangers is constantly recirculated so that it is at a uniform temperature. Fluids from the bulk storage are fed into these circuits to give the required air\ntemperature.\nThe sequence of heat exchanger actions during a thermal cycle is\n(1) Climb: The temperature of the water circulating through the heat exchanger is\nincreased progressively by the addition of hot water at 180 0 C. Warm ammonia at 350 C\nis circulated through the bypassed heat-exchanger elements.\n(2) Cruise: The hot water is gradually decreased and is cut off if the heat input of\nthe fan is greater than the heat losses of the circuit; if this occurs, chilled water at 5 0 C\nis fed to the heat exchanger.\n(3) Descent: The chilled water supply is increased progressively until it is no\nlonger able to maintain the required air-cooling rate. Before the chilled water reaches\n33\n\nits maximum supply rate, the shutters over the ammonia elements open and cold ammonia, at -620 C, is fed into the ammonia heat exchanger. The chilled water continues to\nact as a precooler until the air temperature entering the water heat exchanger drops\nbelow the chilled water temperature. At this stage, hot water is fed to the heat exchanger\nto prevent freezing.\n(4) Recovery: The supply of ammonia at -62 0 C is stopped and the air temperature\nincreases to its datum. If the fan heat input is too large, chilled water will be pumped\nbefore the end of the cycle to keep the air at its datum temperature. At the end of the\nrecovery phase, the ammonia element shutters are closed and the gaps opened to bypass\nthe air.\nThe heating and cooling phases demand large amounts of energy in relatively short\nperiods of time, and in order to spread the requirements of the plant over a complete\ncycle, the heat-exchanger fluids are generated continuously and stored.\nThe hot water is heated by two oil-fired boilers with a total output of\n36 x 10 6 Btu/hr. The water is heated to 180 0 C, and some 100 tons are stored in the\ninsulated storage vessel. The upper part of the vessel serves as an expansion chamber\nand is filled with nitrogen at 180 lb/in 2 to enable water temperature to be attained and to\nprevent cavitation in the water system.\nChilled water at 50 C is provided by an ammonia refrigerating machine with a twostage piston compressor, condenser, and evaporator. The plant has a cooling capacity of\n13.5 x 106 Btu/hr. About 300 tons of chilled water are stored in two insulated vessels\nunder the same pressure as the hot water so that either can be fed to the water heat\nexchanger.\nAmmonia liquid at -62 0 C is generated by two identical multistage turbocompressors working in parallel and having a total capacity of 14.3 x 10 6 Btu/hr. Each turbocompressor uses three stages of flash evaporation. About 145 tons of the cold ammonia is\nstored in two insulated vessels which are interconnected with expansion vessels containing ammonia at 35 0 C. These hold the system at the vapour pressure of ammonia at\n350 C, which is approximately the same as the pressures used in the hot and chilled water\nsystems. The expansion vessels also serve as storage for the supply of ammonia at\n350 C for the heat exchangers while they are bypassed during the heating phase.\nA considerable quantity of cooled water is also required throughout the plant. It is\nused for\n(1) The initial cooling of the chilled water supply\n(2) The condensers of both refrigeration plants\n(3) Maintaining the liquid ammonia below 35 0 C in any parts of the plant where this\ntemperature could be exceeded\n34\n\n(4) Cooling the fan-motor speed controls, which are electrolytic resistors\n(5) Cooling the fluid coupling of the turbocompressors to their electric motors\n(6) Cooling pump glands and other similar applications.\nThe water is cooled from 271 C to 220 C in a two-cell cooling tower, having a total cooling capacity of 70 x 10 6 Btu/hr and a cooling water flow rate of almost 0.8 x 10 6 gal/hr.\nThe circuit of the fans, heat exchangers, and thermal duct is completed by the\nreturn trunking. This is constructed as a double shell, the inner lining being fabricated\nfrom 25 SWG (0.02-inch) stainless steel sheet and having an internal diameter of 6.5 feet.\nThe outer cladding is fabricated from 19 SWG (0.04-inch) aluminium sheet and is separated from the inner lining by a 2-inch thick layer of mineral-wool insulation. Sections\nof the trunking are joined together by stainless steel bellows and cascaded .corners are\nused to assist the airflow. The assembled trunking is completely air and oil tight. The\ntotal lengths of the five circuits vary slightly; the shortest is 590 feet and the longest\n680 feet.\nAll of the plant for the external heating and cooling of the specimen is contained in\na plant house 240 feet x 130 feet x 50 feet high located at the forward end of the test frame.\n(See figs. 17 and 25.) Inside this building is also the control room for the external plant.\nThis is a strong room protected against dangers which might arise from explosion in the\nspecimen or plant. The plant is started and monitored from this control room and, in\nnormal operation, is controlled automatically from the computers. However, individual\nitems of the plant can be run from this room for commissioning and checking purposes,\nand if necessary, a thermal cycle of the whole plant can be run. The plant house is heavily\ninsulated so that noise from the equipment does not seriously disturb work in the adjacent\noffices or destroy the tranquility of the surrounding townships in the quiet of the night.\nInternal Heating, Cooling, and Pressurisation\nAs the name implies, the basic functions of the internal facility are to thermally\ncondition the inside of the specimen and to pressurise the specimen. These are two\nmethods by which these functions may be performed: heating, cooling, and pressurisation\nwith circulated air and heating and cooling with circulated fuel substitute, which for safety\nreasons is used in place of aircraft fuel. In more detail, the tasks needed to be performed\nare\n(1) To represent the normal air conditioning and pressurisation of the fuselage\n(2) To force heat and cool those areas of the structure which would not reach their\nrequired conditions in the shortened accelerated test cycle. This forced heating and cooling is done as appropriate with air or the fuel substitute. This is the major task of the\ninternal plant.\n35\n\n(3) To heat, cool, and load by pressure that area of the underside of the wing normally covered by the nacelle. In the test the real nacelle is not fitted, and all loading\nactions are applied to the wing by a dummy nacelle.\n(4) To correct the thermal condition arising in the wing tips because these are not\ncompletely covered by the external thermal duct. This discontinuity in the external heating and cooling could give rise to unrepresentative loading in the specimen, and to correct\nthis, special treatment is given to the fuel tanks and other structure in this area.\n(5) To pressurise certain of the fuel tanks to represent inertia loads arising on the\nfuel during parts of the test cycle.\nThe whole internal facility divides into three groups, air circuits, fuel systems, and\na background plant which supplies the heating energy, cooling energy, and pressurisation\nair to the primary systems. The major part of the internal plant is housed in a specially\ndesigned plant house, measuring 150 feet x 90 feet x 50 feet high, erected on the starboard\nside of the test frame. (See fig. 17.) The plant house contains the control room for the\ninternal plant, from which the equipment is started and monitored. The plant is normally controlled by computers, but it can, if necessary, be run from this control room\nfor commissioning or checking. Because of the extremely high noise level expected\nfrom the installed plant, the building is of massive construction to provide the necessary sound absorption qualities to avoid disturbance of the neighbourhood.\nThe major components of the primary circuits and systems are connected to the\nspecimen via a very complex and congested system of piping traversing between the plant\nhouse and the main test frame.\nAir circuits.- The areas conditioned by the air circuits are shown in figure 26.\nThese cover the fuselage air-conditioning and pressurisation, the areas to be force\nheated and cooled by air, and the nacelle-wing areas. Among the force conditioned\nareas are fuel tanks 9 and 10, which are emptied in flight before the supersonic phase\ncommences and hence do not need to be filled with fuel substitute in the test. All these\nareas are grouped into 16 zones, some duplicated on port and starboard sides of the aircraft. Zones which have similar thermal and pressure requirements are further grouped\ntogether to give seven primary air circuits.\nThe air circuits are all basically similar; each consists of a Roots blower, one or\nmore heat exchangers, a number of control valves, and connecting piping. A typical circuit circulates about 14 pounds of air per second at a temperature of 130 0 C in the heating\nphase and at 150 C during the cooling phase. The blowers are driven by electric motors\naveraging about 700 hp each. Roots type blowers were chosen as air-moving machinery\nbecause of considerable pressure drops involved in each of the air circuits. Centrifugal\n\n36\n\nfans would have been inadequate and centrifugal compressors were not economically competitive in the sizes required. A typical air circuit is shown in figure 27.\nEach circuit is a closed loop, the air being circulated by means of the Roots blower\nthrough the conditioning system to the various zones of the specimen and then back to the\nsuction side of the blower. The air is heated to the required temperature (130 0 C in most\ncircuits) by a heat exchanger fed with water at 180 0 C from the background plant. For the\ncooling phase, the air passes through two coolers; the first, using cooling-tower water at\n220 C, cools the air to about 35 0 C, and the second, using chilled water at 5 0 C, further\ncools the air to about 15 0 C. Selector valves control the passage of the air to the appropriate heat exchangers.\nThe total mass flow to the specimen is controlled by regulating the valve in the\nblower bypass which bridges the delivery and return pipes across the blower. This flow\nis subdivided in the appropriate circuits by setting inlet trimming valves to apportion the\nflow to each individual zone.\nA bypass is provided between the inlet and outlet pipes to each zone to enable temperature preconditioning of the delivery pipes between phases if required and thereby\nallow a choice of initial air temperature into the specimen. A valve in the bypass prevents flow when not required. The specimen inlet valve dictates whether flow is allowed\nthrough the specimen.\nSome circuits where the zone is not airtight are vented to atmosphere at the specimen; the remaining circuits servicing airtight zones are vented from outlet pipes adjacent\nto the specimen. In all instances therefore the return pipes operate at a subatmospheric\npressure except when a circuit is pressurised. Circuits 1, 3, and 6 are required to be\npressurised during certain phases of the test cycle and are individually supplied with air\nat either 7 or 14 lb/in2 from the background plant via an inlet valve which regulates the\nsupply when an increase of pressure is required. A separate valve decreases the pressure on command by controlled venting to atmosphere. Safety valves are provided at\neach specimen inlet to safeguard against overpressurisation and also at each specimen\noutlet to prevent negative pressure occurring within the specimen.\nEach circuit is fitted with an impingement liquid separator to remove any fuel substitute which may have leaked into it. This is to avoid fouling of the heat exchangers,\nwhich would reduce their efficiency. A mist detector is installed in each circuit to give\nadequate forewarning should the air-fuel substitute ratio become an explosive hazard.\nFire detection and suppression systems are also provided.\nThe Roots blowers are constructed with close running tolerances on their rotors,\nand it is necessary to protect them from harmful temperature fluctuations. Thus, in five\nof the circuits, where the temperature of the air can reach 130 0 C, a heat exchanger is\n37\n\ninstalled at the blower inlet to precool the air returning to the blower. The air temperature in the other circuits does not exceed 60 0 C.\nThe blowers and heat exchangers are installed in the internal plant house on the\nstarboard side of the specimen (fig. 17), and there is therefore a considerable length of\npiping to bring the air to and from the specimen. In a typical circuit, the distance from\nthe heat exchangers to the specimen is about 150 feet, and considerable care has had to\nbe taken to keep the thermal mass of the delivery pipes to a minimum to ensure the\nrequired air temperatures at the specimen. The pipes have a wall thickness of only\n0.04 inch and are covered with 2-inch-thick insulation of low density. The pipes vary in\ndiameter between 6 inches and 24 inches according to the circuit.\nAttaching these pipes to the specimen is also a major problem because of specimen\nmovement caused by the mechanical loading and thermal distortion. There are about 80\nof these pipes, and most of them have had to be fitted with a sliding joint to provide the\nnecessary flexibility. The problem for those carrying pressure is even more severe as\nthe end loads from these could provide unacceptable spurious loads on the specimen.\nThis problem has been overcome by the design of special balanced fittings.\nHaving brought the air to the specimen, there is still the mammoth task of distributing it to all the zones requiring conditioning. Essentially this is done by a gallery system with air-distribution points along its length. A typical one for the fuselage airconditioning is shown diagrammatically in figure 28. A similar gallery system is used\nto collect the air and return it to the plant. All pipes are taken into and out of the structure through existing holes wherever possible so that the primary structure of the specimen is not affected.\nFuel systems.- The layout of the fuel tanks is shown in figure 29. As mentioned\npreviously, tanks 9 and 10 are conditioned with air, but all of the remainder need to be\nfilled with fluid in the test to represent the fuel. The choice of a suitable simulant for\nthe fuel has been a very difficult task. The use of kerosene itself would have been too\ndangerous and its repeated use through the many thermal cycles and long periods at\nelevated temperature would have presented deterioration. The main features that have\nbeen looked for in a simulant are\n(1) A sufficiently high flash point to avoid fire and explosion risks\n(2) Acceptable heat-transfer characteristics so that representative thermal conditions can be achieved in the specimen tanks\n(3) Compatibility with the constructional materials of both specimen and plant\n(4) Slow appreciation of acidic level and general stability when thermally cycled or\nmaintained for long periods at elevated temperature\n(5) Low cost.\n38\n\nThe fuel simulant chosen, Shell 7305c, is a mineral oil with antioxidant additives.\nExtensive tests have been made to develop the fluid and to show that it meets the previously mentioned qualifications. In the following description of the plant and the installations in the specimen, the fluid is referred to simply as fuel.\nIn the aircraft itself, there are varying levels in the tanks as the fuel is used up.\nThese varying levels could have been represented in the test, but it was decided to simplify the procedure by using a constant quantity of fuel in the tanks. By carefully choosing the quantity of fuel and its temperature programme during the test cycle, it has been\npossible to achieve a close representation of the critical thermal stresses in the tank\nstructure. Most tanks are about 75 percent full with some 90 percent full. Great care\nhas been taken with the filling system so that the specimen shall not be damaged. The\nlarge fuel-circulating pumps cannot be used for this task, and a special small pump\n(25 gal/min) has been provided for the purpose. It is under manual control monitored\nfrom the computer. Thus the quantity of fuel in each tank can be chosen before cycling\nstarts. Since each tank is in its own closed circuit, the quantity of fluid in the tank\nremains constant, apart from leakage, which may occur as the specimen is tested. One\nof the functions of the monitoring computer is to check these quantities and initiate shutdown if they go outside acceptable limits.\nSpecial provision is available to change the level of fluid in the tank during the test\ncycle in order to simulate flight usage for the special witness tests in real time in which\nmeasurements on the specimen are compared with flight measurements. Varying this\nlevel, of course, changes the weight of the specimen during the cycle and has implications\non the hydraulic loading and control systems.\nIn total there are thirteen separate fuel systems, each one serving a single tank\nwithin the specimen. Ten of the systems are temperature conditioned. Each system\nincludes a pump, one heat exchanger, and control valves; these components are sized to\nmeet the requirements of each particular tank. Two of the remaining three systems provide for fuel circulation only, while for the last tank provision is made for filling and\nemptying only. (See fig. 29.)\nA typical specimen tank contains about 1800 gallons of fuel and requires a pumping\nrate of 350 gal/min through pipes of 5-inch diameter against a system resistance of\nabout 120 lb/in2 . Each system is vented at the specimen tank, and the pump is located\nin the main test frame to prevent cavitation at the inlet. A typical temperature conditioned system is shown in figure 30.\nDuring normal cycling operation, the fuel is pumped from the specimen tank through\nthe single heat exchanger located in the plant house and then back to the specimen tank.\nThe flow rate in the system is controlled by a closed-loop servocontrol operating on the\nthrottling valve.\n39\n\nDuring the heating phase, the fuel is progressively heated until that in the specimen tanks reaches the required temperature (usually 90 0 C). The heating is obtained by\nfeeding hot water at 120 0 C to the heat exchanger at a preselected rate. Similarly in the\ncooling phase, the fuel is cooled until that in the specimen tanks reaches the required\ntemperature (usually 25 0 C). The cooling is obtained by feeding chilled water at 5 0 C to\nthe heat exchanger at a preselected rate. Between these phases the fuel may continue to\nbe circulated, if required, with the energy supply to the heat exchanger interrupted to\nprevent further unwanted temperature increase or decrease, which prevents temperature\nstratification within the tank due to heat transfer through the skin from the external heating and cooling system.\nConsiderable attention has been given to the design of an efficient distribution system inside each specimen tank with the objective of ensuring 100-percent mixing of the\ningoing fuel with the bulk. Internal pipes extend to the extremities of each tank and the\ningoing fuel is injected at a pressure of about 20 lb/in g through a large number of small\nholes drilled along the length of the internal supply pipes.\nPlate heat exchangers are provided because of their considerably superior heattransfer qualities at the existing low Reynolds numbers. They have the additional advantage of being easy to dismantle for inspection and cleaning. Each system includes a small\npump to maintain the water flow required through the heat exchanger to provide stable\nflow and heat-transfer characteristics.\nSpecimen considerations dictate that the acidic level of the fuel should not exceed\na very low level; to this end chemical filters are provided in each system. Each filter is\nlocated in a bypass fed by a metering pump through a separate heater to provide continuous filtering at 30 gal/hr. All pipes and components with large surface areas in contact\nwith the fuel are manufactured from stainless steel to minimise fuel contamination.\nThe total quantity of fuel in the system is a little over 20 000 gallons, and a storage\ntank of 25 000 gallons is provided to hold the fuel when it is removed from the specimen\nfor structural inspections. The tank is lined with epoxy resin to prevent contamination.\nBackground plant.- The background plant consists of the heating plant, refrigeration\n\nplant, cooling tower, and pressurisation plant. An oil-fired boiler of 16 x 10 6 Btu/hr output is provided to meet the overall heating demands of the primary air and fuel systems,\nthe demands of which are about equal. The boiler produces water at 180 0 C and operates\nat a pressure of 180 lb/in g . This water is used directly in the heat exchangers of the air\ncircuits, but for the fuel systems the water is reduced to a lower temperature through a\nheat exchanger which produces water at 120 0 C.\nAlthough the heating demands of the facility are cyclic with a maximum rate of\ndemand of approximately three times the average, it was not considered economically\n40\n\nadvantageous to reduce the size of the boiler and install a storage system for the hot\nwater. The boiler output will meet the demand on line for most of the cycle, the remainder being supplied from some spare capacity existing in the external plant.\nRefrigeration energy is provided by means of a four-stage turbocompressor of\n13 x 10 6 Btu/hr capacity using freon as a transfer agent. It is driven by a 1000-hp electric motor and produces chilled water at 5 0 C for cooling in the air and fuel systems.\nThe chilled water is generated continuously and stored in an insulated vessel of\n28 000 gallons capacity (about 125 tons).\nA single-cell tower cools almost 0.5 x 10 6 gallons of water per hour from 27 0 C to\n220 C, thereby dissipating about 40 x 10 6 Btu/hr. This tower provides the eventual heat\nsink for all the energy going into the facility.\nA battery of six Roots blowers with a total output of 18 pounds of air per second and\na total power of 1500 hp provides the air for pressurisation on line when required. The\nair is pressurised in two stages, from ambient to 7 lb/in 2 gage and then from 7 to\n14 lb/in2 gage. Between stages the air is cooled to lo o C in a cooler using chilled water\nand the precipitating droplets are removed in a separator; the dewpoint then corresponds\nto 50 C at ambient pressure.\nSafety Precautions\nThe safety of the specimen is, of course, a major consideration in any full-scale\nfatigue test; for the Concorde it is even more important because of the very long time of\ntesting involved. If this specimen were lost after some years of testing, it would be\nimpossible to catch up the programme and to achieve the desired aircraft safety requirement. The specimen must always be tested to at least three times the life of any aircraft in service. Extensive safeguards against a number of hazards arising from different sources are therefore essential.\nExcess-air-pressure safeguards.- Pressure within the specimen is measured by a\ntransducer in all discrete compartments connected to the air system, whether they are\nnormally pressurised or not. Areas normally unpressurised are included since the\npower of the circulating pumps is such that a blockage in the circuits could produce a\nhazard to the specimen. Some 40 measurement points are fitted and are checked at all\ntimes by the monitoring computer, which informs the operator of significant deviations\nfrom the required values and in extreme cases initiates automatic shutdown.\nA mechanical direct-operating safety valve is fitted on the inlet pipe to each zone.\nSimilar valves are fitted on the pressurisation feed pipes of the circuits that are pressurised. In addition there is built into each compartment, including all the fuel tanks, a\ndirect-operating pressure-relief valve.\n41\n\nAntivacuum safeguards.- Pressures measured in all compartments are checked by\nthe monitoring computer to ensure that a malfunction of an air-conditioning system does\nnot create a subatmospheric condition within the specimen. A mechanical directoperating safety valve is fitted on the outlet pipe from each zone.\nFuel-level surveillance.- The fuel level in each fuel tank is measured by a transducer and checked against the expected level by the monitoring computer. An increasing level could ultimately result in excess pressure and a decreasing level would indicate\nthat fuel simulant was escaping, thereby creating a potential explosive hazard.\nExplosive-hazard safeguard.- By the very nature of the test, it is likely that at some\nstage fuel simulant will leak from the specimen and will enter the air circuits. If it does\nso, there is a danger that in the fast-moving airstream of changing temperature, it will\nform a potentially dangerous fuel mist. To meet this possibility, a mist detector is\ninstalled in each of the external and internal air circuits to give adequate forewarning\nbefore the mist becomes an explosive hazard.\nFire detection and suppression.- Infrared and smoke detectors are installed both\ninside the specimen and in the external thermal duct surrounding the specimen. The\ndetectors are connected to a bulk-storage CO2 suppression system which will automatically flood the external ducts and the specimen should a detector become activated.\nExtensive fire detection devices are also fitted in the test laboratory and plant houses.\nAmmonia detection.- To safeguard against the possible corrosion of the specimen\nshould ammonia leak from a heat exchanger into an external air circuit, an ammonia\ndetector is installed in each circuit. Further detectors are located in the external plant\nhouse to give adequate warning to personnel.\nMECHANICAL-LOADING SYSTEM FOR MAJOR FATIGUE TEST\nThe mechanical loading is applied by a conventional linkage system from hydraulic\njacks, servocontrolled from the computer system.\nLoads and Reactions\nThe test laboratory, approximately 200 feet x 100 feet x 40 feet high, is effectively\na strong box, so that vertical and side loads can be reacted directly to the building. It\nwas designed as a general purpose test frame. The floor is strongly reinforced with steel\nbeams with frequent attachment points, and a series of overhead moveable bridges can be\nplaced at convenient locations to react the up loads. For the Concorde these are supplemented by portal frames over the wing tips and fuselage nose.\nThe loads are applied to the specimen by conventional means. Swivel loading points\nare bolted to the upper and lower surfaces of the wing and to each side of the fin. Groups\n42\n\nof loading points are connected together by a "Christmas-tree" linkage to hydraulic jacks.\nFuselage loads are applied to bulkheads or distributed to the floor beams by a system of\nloading beams inside the specimen. These are linked by rods to a number of hydraulic\njacks outside the specimen. Dummy undercarriages and dummy nacelles are fitted to the\nspecimen, and through these, undercarriage and engine loads can be applied.\nFor the ground tests the specimen rests on the dummy undercarriages and is loaded\nthrough the hydraulic jacks and linkages to give the correct overall distribution. For the\nflight tests the specimen is balanced in its linkage system, but a number of constraints at\nthe undercarriages restrict its movement. All of these constraints are fitted with load\nmeasuring devices and record either balancing reactions or zero load as appropriate.\nTable II and figures 31 and 32 give more detail of the loading system.\nHydraulic System\nEach hydraulic jack is set in a simple load-control circuit, which is made up of a\nload cell, electrohydraulic servo valve, and control module, which holds the load under\nanalogue control until a new set point is given it from the overall control system. All the\nloading jacks are controlled by a PDP8/I computer.\nThe jacks mainly act in tension, although some act in tension and compression.\nThey have been sized so that they can apply proof loads to the specimen as required for\nfail-safe testing towards the close of the fatigue test. They are fitted with PTFE seals to\nkeep the friction low enough to avoid stick-slip effects in the system when small loads are\nbeing applied.\nThe load cells have two measuring bridges. One output is fed back to the control\ncomputer and is used to set up the required load; the other is fed back to the PDP10 monitor computer, where it is compared with the requested load level. Small, but significant,\ndeviations from the required load are printed out and larger deviations initiate shutdown.\nFuller details of the monitoring procedures are given subsequently.\nMoog electrohydraulic servovalves are used throughout the system. These valves\nare two stage. The first, a preamplifier stage, uses a torque motor to convert the electrical input signal to a hydraulic signal, which drives the second, or power, stage. The\ntorque motor operates a flapper which pivots between two hydraulic nozzles forming two\nvariable orifices. Fluid under pressure is supplied to these nozzles through two fixed\norifices, and the pressures between the orifices and the nozzles are applied to the ends\nof the spring-centred second stage, or main, spool. The flow through the valve is proportional to the main spool displacement and, thus, to the input electrical signal for a\nknown pressure drop across the valve. Where higher flows are required, two servovalves\nare operated in parallel or a much larger valve is used.\n\n43\n\nThe jack load is controlled by a simple error-signal device, which compares the\nrequired signal with the measured signal from the load cell. The error signal is amplified and drives the electrohydraulic servovalve to correct the load and so reduce the\nerror signal to zero. This load is then held until a new set point is input to the system.\nEach hydraulic control module has a number of local safety devices which are additional to the overall surveillance exercised by the monitoring computer. These local\ndevices limit the maximum load and travel available at the jack. A typical hydraulic\nmodule circuit for a single acting tension jack is shown in figure 33. The differential\npressure switch (DPS) initiates a fail-safe shutdown if the differential pressure across\nthe jacks exceeds that set on the switch; the differential pressure relief valve (DPRV)\nvents high-pressure oil from either side of the jack to the other if the differential pressure exceeds a preset limit, these valves act as a backup to the differential pressure\nswitches and prevent excessive loads on the specimen. When any safety device is activated, the isolating valves (LV) isolate the jack from the servovalve and ensure controlled\ndumping through the dump valves (DV). In addition, limit switches are used to sense\nexcessive deflection of the jack rods and these also initiate shutdown.\nThe hydraulic power is supplied by 20 variable delivery pumps. Each pump is\ndriven by a 30-hp motor and delivers 14 gallons per minute at 3000 lb/in 2 pressure. The\npumps are arranged in banks of 5, each bank controlled by its own master control valve.\nThis arrangement permits the independent shutdown of a bank of pumps if necessary.\nThe pumps are supplemented by a battery of 8-gallon accumulators to provide for any peak\ndemands of fluid in excess of pump output and to absorb any line pressure surges.\nHydraulic fluid for the system is contained in two 750-gallon reservoirs. The temperature of the fluid (OM33) is maintained at 38 0 C by a thermostatically controlled immersion\nheater in each reservoir. Fluid is distributed from the pumps to hydraulic control modules situated in the various loading areas by a complex system of piping, which is located\nin trunking to contain any leakage.\nConsiderable attention has been given to achieving a high degree of cleanliness in\nthe fluid. This cleanliness is necessary because of the small clearances and orifice\ndiameters within the servovalve. These are susceptible to the fine particles which can\ncause silting or erosion of the orifices and hence alter the performance of the servovalve\nand ultimately possibly result in failure of the valve. Filters are fitted at the pump inlet\n(0.005-inch rating), at the pump outlet (10-micron rating), and at the inlet to the servovalve\n(1.5-micron rating).\nLoading Sequences\nThe weight of the specimen, fuel substitute, and rigging is carried by the loading\njacks, and account has to be taken of this in determining the loads to be applied by the\n44\n\ncomputer. Prior to starting a test cycle, the whole system is set up to a "weightless"\ncondition. Small pretension loads are included where needed to remove slackness from\nthe linkage. Under these conditions, all the load cells at the reaction points should read\nzero.\nThe test cycle commences with the ground loads, including the following conditions\n(1) 1g standing on the ground\n(2) Engine runup\n(3) Taxying loads\n(4) Take-off.\nThe appropriate reaction-point loads are checked throughout to ensure that the required\n\nloading pattern is being applied.\nThe loading is then adjusted to the various phases of the flight including\n(1) lg climb\n(2) Gusts during climb\n(3) Manoeuvre during climb\n(4) lg cruise\n(5) Gusts during cruise (including lateral gusts)\n(6) lg descent\n(7) Gusts during descent and stand off.\nThis is followed by the landing and final taxying conditions including\n(1) Landing (including nosewheel "abattee" conditions)\n(2) Braking\n(3) Reverse thrust\n(4) Taxying\n(5) lg standing on the ground.\nThroughout these sequences, the loading has to take account of changes in the aircraft weight as the fuel is used up and of changes in the air-load distribution in subsonic\nand supersonic flight, together with the fuel transfer necessary to compensate these\nchanges. The programme includes flights with different gust severities (rough flights and\nsmooth flights) and similarly takes account of rough and smooth airfields and different\nlanding conditions to represent real-service conditions.\n\n45\n\nMechanical-Loading Letdown System\nIf for any reason a test cycle has to be aborted while the specimen is under load,\nit is necessary to have a safe system to return it to the no-load condition. For the\nConcorde this is done by a controlled letdown procedure. On receiving a failure signal,\nthe monitor computer deenergises a shutdown relay which in turn deenergises the following equipment:\n(1) The pilot control valves on each jack module, which momentarily lock the specimen in position\n(2) The main solenoid valves in both pump rooms, which divert oil in supply lines\nto reservoir tanks\n(3) The air-operated solenoid valve, which in turn vents pressure from the diverter\nvalves in the return lines thereby directing returning oil to the letdown tank instead of the\nreservoir tank\n(4) The main hydraulic and pilot pressure pumps, which stop oil flow\n(5) The electrohydraulic servovalves, setting them to open circuit\n(6) The dump valves on each jack module, which initiates the letdown of the applied\nloads to zero.\nThe basic design of the letdown system is to separate the hydraulic jack return lines\ninto 5 discrete groups which are\n(1) Over-specimen vertical jacks\n(2) Under-specimen vertical jacks\n(3) Fuselage and fin lateral jacks\n(4) Engine-nacelle jacks\n(5) Undercarriage jacks.\nThese groups are chosen so that a balance between port and starboard will be maintained during letdown. All jacks in groups 1, 2, and 3 have collapsible linkage of length\nsuch that compression loads cannot be transmitted to the specimen. In groups 1, 2, 3,\nand 4 when the dump valves are deenergised, the annulus side of all jack pistons in each\ngroup is connected to a common return pipe through a preset restrictor to the letdown\ntank. The restrictor flow can be varied between 0.25 and 15 gallons per minute. This\nflow rate determines the rate of letdown. All the undercarriage jacks (group 5) are equal\narea double rodded types, and during letdown, pressure is vented from one side of the piston to the other.\n\n46\n\nIn general, loads are controlled by the specimen returning to its natural no-load\nposition. Excessive pressure or load is prevented by the differential pressure relief\nvalves fitted in the hydraulic control module for each jack.\nInteractions With Multichannel Systems\nWhen a single loading channel is controlling the load being imparted to a structure,\nit is relatively easy to determine the characteristics of the complete system (including\nthe structure) and to achieve optimum response from the system. In the case of a multichannel loading system used for the fatigue testing of a large structure, it is necessary to\nensure that all the loading channels are kept in phase and apply the correct loads. Each\nloading point in a multichannel loading system has different mechanical parameters, such\nas stiffness and inertia. Such a system is a compound one, with many subsystems or\nchannels so interconnected by the test structure that they influence each other. The\ndegree of this influence or interaction is dependent both on the strength of the coupling\nbetween respective channels and on the mechanical parameters of each channel. For\nexample, there would be little interaction between two channels with high inertias which\nwere weakly coupled; this type of compound system would show characteristics similar to\nthose of the individual channels. On the other hand, if the coupling were strong, the characteristics of the compound system would be very different from those of the individual\nsystems acting alone.\nThe magnitude of spurious loads caused by interaction depends on a number of factors. It will depend, firstly, on the degree of coupling between the channels and on the\nmagnitude of the mechanical parameters of each individual channel; secondly, on the speed\nof application of loads; and thirdly, on the response characteristics of the individual channels. In many instances, the effects of interaction are minimal and can be ignored.\nSometimes, however, significant errors arise because of interaction, and then it must\neither be counteracted by test techniques or, if this is impossible, taken into account in\nthe analysis of the results.\nSince the magnitude of the interaction loads is dependent on the speed of application\nof the loading, it can be diminished by slowing the rate of loading. It can also be diminished by increasing the response of the affected channel. Both these methods have their\nlimitations, the first because of the time scale of the test being conducted and the second\nbecause by increasing the response, the stability margin is decreased, and unwanted oscillations can result. These oscillations can cause problems as great as the one eradicated.\nClearly, these problems are intimately connected with the particular characteristics\nof the specimen and system involved. They are difficult to predict. They produce further\nproblems in the commissioning of the system which frequently has to be done channel by\nchannel on a separate rig. Great care must therefore be exercised in the interpretation\n47\n\nof the results from such rigs when applying them to real structure. Small multichannel\ntests are being done for the Concorde system using dummy specimens of representative\nstiffness.\nCONTROL AND MONITORING SYSTEMS FOR MAJOR FATIGUE TEST\nBasic Requirements\nThe requirements imposed upon the control and monitoring systems divide into\nthree main categories: control of the test, monitoring, particularly concerning the safety\nof the specimen, and collection of data, mainly from the specimen itself. Beside these\nexplicit requirements, there are others, such as the need to achieve high reliability and to\nhave a configuration giving a good margin of operational flexibility.\nThe requirements for the control function are, of course, dictated by the task which\nhas to be performed. Essentially, this is in two parts, control of the heating and cooling\nplant and control of the mechanical loading system. There are about 50 channels of plant\nrequiring continuous control with nearly 160 switching channels. The continuous control\nchannels involve a complex thermal plant, where nonlinearities and significant time delays\nabound, making this an ideal application for the potential power of direct digital control.\nThe mechanical loading system has a capacity for 150 channels of which currently about\n100 are being used to control the hydraulic jacks, which because of their speed of response\nwould impose a formidable task to control in a direct digital mode. These channels are,\ntherefore, controlled by force feedback on continuous data control loops which only require\nupdating with voltages proportional to the demand loads.\nBecause of the large number of components in the overall plant and in the control\nsystem itself, there is a very real chance that the specimen might be damaged as a result\nof a system failure. Hence, very careful monitoring must take place of all the systems,\nand automatic action must be taken if system failure develops. The cumulative nature of\nthe fatigue process makes it acceptable to shut down the test when any failure is detected,\nalleviating any need to take over control. The provision of a failure detection system\nmust aim at reducing to a very low probability the chance of applying an incorrect condition to the test specimen, during its several tens of thousands of hours of testing.\nAnything less than a completely independent monitoring system relies on the ability\nto predict all the possible forms of failure of a shared component. Since the difficulty of\nachieving this independence increases rapidly as the shared component becomes complex,\nthe only prudent solution is the totally independent system. This totally independent system will have a finite probability of failure; therefore, the chance of applying an unacceptable condition to the specimen is directly related to the probability of both the control and\nmonitoring systems failing within an interval which is sufficient to allow a runaway chan48\n\nnel to deviate unacceptably. It can be shown that even with mean time between failures\nfor the whole system of as low as a few tens of hours and checking rates of approximately\nonce per second, the probability of dual failure is very low. Thus separate control and\nmonitoring systems have been chosen to take care of the test environment. (See fig. 34.)\nAlthough the system is primarily designed to run as a complete entity, the control computers may be run individually on their respective systems. Equally, it is possible to use\nthe surveillance of the monitoring computer when parts of the overall testing facility are\nbeing run on their own hardware control systems.\nA special peripheral unit housed in the monitoring computer is responsible for providing the time base for all the computer systems and at the same time checking that they\nare running in close synchronism. It consists of two separate crystal clocks, one of\nwhich produces pulses at a rate of 1 hertz and the other at rates of 1000 hertz and 1 hertz.\nBasically, each processor is made to count the 1000-hertz pulses and check them against\nthe 1-hertz pulses; the safety of the system is preserved by having the two sources of\n1-hertz pulses.\nThe effect of the test on the specimen is measured through attached strain, temperature, and deflection transducers. In all, these number about 3500 and require to be scanned in less than 10 seconds. Facilities are needed to scan subsets of the total number of\ntransducers and to perform various degrees of processing on the recorded data. A data\nlogging system associated with the monitoring computer performs this task.\nHardware and Its Operation\nOverall hardware configuration.- The overall hardware configuration is shown in\nfigure 35 and may be summarised as follows:\nPDP10 monitoring computer:\nSize of computer word, 36 bits\n32K of 1.6 microsecond core store\n16K of 1 microsecond core store\nTwo 512K fixed head disc stores\nFour DEC tape controllers\n300 lines per minute line printer\nDigital XY plotter\nVB10 visual display\nVR12 slave display\nTwo British standard digital data interfaces\n240 channel analogue multiplexer\n174 digital inputs\nTwo 10-8 data link interfaces\n1000 ch/sec paper tape reader\n49\n\n300 ch/sec paper tape reader\n150 ch/sec paper tape punch\n50 ch/sec paper tape punch\nFour KSR 35 teletypes\nOne ASR 33 teletype\nK70 plant control computer (incorporating a PDP8/I computer):\nSize of computer word, 12 bits\n20K of 3 microsecond core store\n32K fixed head disc store\n48 channels of direct digital control input/output\n190 digital outputs\n63 digital inputs\nASR 33 teletype\nShared 1000 ch/sec paper tape reader l\nShared 150 ch/sec paper tape punch J) With loading computer\n8-10 data link interface\nPDP8/I loading computer:\nSize of computer word, 12 bits\n8K of 3 microsecond core store\n256K fixed head disc store\nExtended arithmetic unit (hardware multiplier)\n5 digital outputs\n2 digital inputs\n150 jack output cards giving t5 or +10 volt output\nASR 33 teletype\nShared paper tape punch and reader\n8-10 data link interface.\nGeneral operational principles.- After the computers have been switched on and have\nhad their programs loaded, they first have to be synchronised. They are each informed of\nthe real time at which they will expect to see the first clock pulse from the special clock\nunit situated in the PDP10. When this unit is switched on the appropriate parts of the programmes count up time to give each computer a real-time base on which to operate its\nplant control and monitoring functions. All control information or instruction to the computers is input via one or more of the teletypes attached to the machines. The next stage\nof operation involves the input of the engineering data giving the magnitudes of the functions to be performed which have already been defined, in principle, by the application\nprograms written to make the computers perform the dedicated tasks associated with the\ntest.\n50\n\nThe engineering data are prepared in advance, in duplicate, by two independent\npunch operators from the carefully checked manuscript information formulated around\nthe structural demands of the test. These identical punched paper tapes are then input to\nthe control and monitoring computers; load information only is put into the loading computer and process information into the K70 machine. The computers then transform the\nengineering data into special internal machine formats and check the data for consistency\nwith respect to both the hardware and the software. In a later stage of the startup procedure, the data are cross-checked within the computer system using the data links which\nconnect the control machines to the PDP10. By this means it is possible to be sure that\nthe information has been input correctly. Once the data have been input and the expected\nconfiguration of the plant has been defined to the computers, the computers can accept the\nvarious parts of the plant for control. This step is necessary because on certain occasions only limited parts of the plant may be run, especially during commissioning.\nAs and when the plant engineers request startup of each major unit of the plant,\nwhich has direct control over the conditions at the specimen, these requests are ratified\nby the control and monitoring computers and relayed back to the plant initiating startup\nof that unit. If the various units are started up in the previously defined order, it should\nbe possible to take the whole of the specified plant onto control with its associated checking through the monitoring computer. During or after this stage, all the control points\nmay be instructed to move to their precycle conditions. The whole of the test rig can\nthus be made ready for cycling, which it will commence on receipt of an instruction defining the start time. The actual programme that is then followed is inherent in the data\ninput to the computers and is executed entirely automatically unless terminated prematurely. Various instructions exist to enable an operator to override the automatic\nsequence previously defined; these allow premature termination of a cycling sequence or\nalteration of its contents or a return to static conditions at the end of the current cycle.\nThroughout the test rig, inner and outer limits are set for the variables, and these\nare checked by the monitoring computer through independent transducers by comparing\nmeasured values with expected values. The inner limits are set such that small deviations which would not significantly affect the accuracy of the test or prejudice its safety\nare permitted. Outer limits are set at levels which would be prejudicial to the test and\nexceedance of these automatically causes shutdown. Any variation between these two\nlimits is recorded on teletype for the immediate information of the operator and also on\npaper tape for subsequent analysis. By these means the control of the test is virtually\nautomatic and follows a prescribed plan; the burden imposed on the operators is thereby\ngreatly minimised. If current information is required about any of the controlled conditions, instructions are available to allow the operator to display these on the cathode-ray\ntube, giving all relevant data to allow an assessment of the operating status of the test\nrig. In a similar way, the data logger may be instructed to survey a prescribed set of\n51\n\ntransducers and print the resulting information in an engineering format on one of the\nteletypes. For larger data-collection surveys, the transducers to be scanned may be\ndefined on punched paper tape, together with the times when they are to take place. The\nlogging will take place automatically at the prescribed times, and the results may be output for subsequent processing on another machine.\nSelective shutdown is possible on a predefined basis. This avoids shutdown of the\nwhole of the plant when one small area is subject to failure and is not potentially damaging\nto the specimen. Later, this shutdown part of the plant may be brought back onto control\nduring an artificially imposed pause in the cycling.\nControl of Air- and Fuel-Conditioning Plant\nExternal-air systems.- Two parameters in each of the five circuits of the external\nconditioning systems are controlled by the K70 process computer in a direct digital control mode. They are the air temperature and the circulating fan speed. The air temperature is controlled through a cascaded loop which involves feeding the heat-exchangerfluid temperature back to the computer as well as the air temperature itself. A hybrid\ncomputer simulation showed that this technique should be sufficient to give the required\naccuracies throughout a fatigue cycle without having to change the control algorithm;\naccuracy is improved significantly if it is accepted that the measured value is delayed\nfrom the set point by approximately 4 seconds. If during commissioning it becomes\nobvious that there are significant errors, then as a first step, it is possible to programme\ntime-varying control parameters. There is an added virtue in having a measure of the\nheat-exchanger-fluid temperature within the computer, since it assists restarting particularly if a test cycle has been aborted at high temperature. It then becomes necessary\nto pick up the specimen at its elevated temperature and to force it back to room temperature conditions without inducing large temperatures differences. This procedure requires\nthe heat-exchanger temperature to be controlled at the current specimen temperature\nbefore the circulating fan for that duct is switched on.\nThe control of the speed of each circulating fan is based on measurements of the\nfan speed using a tachogenerator and is obtained by altering an electrolytic resistance in\nseries with the rotor of the fan motor.\nInternal-air systems.- There are seven circuits air-conditioning the internal structure of the specimen, each of which has one or more parameters under direct digital control using the K70 computer. These systems are all based on similar principles, but\nsome circuits provide more facilities than others. One of the more complex ones controls two mass flows, one temperature, and eight pressures. Like the controlled parameters of the external circuit, the set points may be specified as a series of points varying\nwith time which are then interpolated by the computer to derive the once-per-second\n52\n\nvalues required for control. By this means it is possible to make significant economies\nin the amounts of input data which have to be prepared by hand. This facility is further\nenhanced by the provision of editing software making it possible to alter small amounts\nof data through a typewriter keyboard directly connected to the computer.\nInternal-fuel systems.- The temperature in twelve of the thirteen tanks is controlled continuously through regulation of a single parameter per tank, namely, the fuel\ncirculation flow. In the ten circuits which are temperature conditioned, this continuous\ncontrol is achieved by an open-loop technique where the appropriate hot or cold fluid is\nswitched into the heat exchanger; no temperature feedback is used, the method relying on\nthe repeatability of conditions.\nJack Loading Computer\nSynthesis of net jack load.- Because of the overall requirement to retain the maximum flexibility in the test system combined with economy of storage space in the computers, the net load on any jack is built up from its fundamental components. Broadly,\nthere are two components consisting of a slowly varying or steady load due to aerodynamic\nlift in flight or weight of the aircraft on the ground and a second, more rapidly varying,\ncomponent due to turbulent conditions and manoeuvres in flight or taxying bumps on the\nground. The second component may be further subdivided into a part which defines the\nmagnitude of the gust or bump on the aircraft as a whole, for example, a gust of 10 ft/sec\nat a specified time or a bump of 0.1g at another time, and another part specifying the load\nin that particular jack due to a unit gust or bump; this latter part defines the load distribution between jacks which may vary for the different loading conditions. In algebraic\nterms this becomes\nL=S+WG\nwhere\nL\t\n\nthe load on a particular jack\n\nS\t\n\nthe steady component of load for that jack\n\nG\t\n\nthe gust or bump magnitude for the aircraft as a whole\n\nW\t\n\nthe distribution factor defining the load seen by the jack per unit gust or bump\n\nBy this means it is possible to build up a large repertoire of flights from a relatively\nsmall amount of data.\n53\n\n0.^\n\nTest cycles are quantised into phases where either or both the steady load and set\nof weighting factors W are constant. Gusts and bumps are required to be applied in\nsynchronism throughout the specimen and to a constant waveform. In certain circumstances the waveform is extended in duration to limit the acceleration forces on the test\nspecimen.\nJack set-pointing system.- The jack computer provides set-point voltages for up to\n150 jack control channels, the force feedback control loops being entirely external to the\ncomputer. A flow diagram of the system is given in figure 36 which shows the basic\ncomputer, a PDP8/I, driving through a standard Kent processor interface to a special\njack-driver interface through to the analogue output cards. It produces t5-volt or 0- to\n10-volt signals for bidirectional and unidirectional jacks, respectively, the particular\nvoltage being selected by a simple shorting link on each output card. As may be seen,\nthe hardware makes use of load synthesis as detailed in the previous section. The isolation of the computer central processor from the electrohydraulic control channels occurs\nat the input of the jack-driver interface and is implemented through optical coupling; it\nachieves a high standard of isolation allowing the use of separate power grounds, thereby\nhelping to protect the computer from noise likely to produce malfunction.\nA sample-and-hold circuit accepts the current steady-load voltage and holds it for\none-half second until the next update, thereby restricting steady-load changes to a maximum rate of twice per second for small increments. Step changes of more than the odd\nleast significant bit (the steady load is set up to a resolution of 9 bits plus sign) are unacceptable to the jack control system, so a special procedure is adopted for substantial load\nchanges. For these changes the steady load is updated at a rate of 20 times per second\nduring the change giving a fine linear staircase type of output. To create the gust component, a constant amplitude waveform representing a half gust is input to the jack output\ncard. This is again to a resolution of 9 bits plus sign updated at the rate of 1000 times\nper second. Half gusts may be only initiated at 1-second bounds when the steady load\nis updated and the software imposes a constraint that the component be zero for the first\nand last 25 milliseconds of the half-gust period. Normally, the half-gust duration is\n2 seconds, but it may be requested up to 16 seconds with an overall restriction that it be\nsymmetric about the quarter-gust point. The constant-amplitude gust is scaled by a third\ndigital input to the jack card which is to a resolution of 9 bits plus sign to select whether\nthe half gust be positive or negative going.\nA single jack card is set up within 160 microseconds giving a maximum delay\nbetween channel 1 and channel 150 of 24 milliseconds for the steady-load component. The\ncomparable delay on the gust component is less than 2 milliseconds.\nDroop nose.- The droop nose is activated by two digital outputs from the jack computer, the first switching on the hydraulic pump to generate supply pressure and the second switching the control valve to stroke the droop jack.\n54\n\nPlant Monitoring\nGeneral principles.- As mentioned previously, there is a need for a failure detection system; this system is provided by the PDP10 computer and its peripheral devices.\nStrictly, it is an independent system which together with the control computers is able to\nindicate a lack of consistency between control and monitoring. By software its use is\nextended into a discriminating recording facility, where it disregards information which\nis consistent with correct operation, and promotes shutdown when there are gross errors,\nbut stores and subsequently outputs data values between these two extremes. This technique avoids the vast quantities of redundant information which would be created by a\ncontinuous, conventional recording system. To be successful, the system depends upon\nthe levels of discrimination being set up with great care; information which is intended to\nbe disregarded must not have a significant effect on the test result, and that which initiates\nshutdown must preserve the safety of the specimen and the meaningfulness of the test.\nIn most cases the parameter which is controlled by the control computer is also\nmonitored by the PDP10, but within the internal plant there are several exceptions.\nThese exceptions occur either because the control function may be open loop or because\nthe parameter of direct interest is only implicitly related to that which is directly controlled. Typically, in the internal air circuits the air temperature near the energy\nsource and mass flow are controlled, but it is considered sufficient to monitor the temperature much nearer the specimen together with the state of any air distribution valves\nin that circuit. Because the digital computer inputs associated with valve monitoring are\nconsiderably cheaper than the analogue inputs for, say, mass flow, considerable economies\ncan be achieved. There are complementary savings in computer time and storage.\nTypes of checking and their frequency.- Apart from the load channels, all checking\nis carried out at the same frequency as the related control functions are updated, that is,\nonce per second. Analogue parameters are checked against inner and outer, upper and\nlower limits. Valve positions, which are input on a pair of digital inputs, are checked for\nthe correct state, for example, binary 10 for off, 01 for on, and 00 for the transient state,\nwhich is allowed a preset time.\nSince the loading channels can deviate more rapidly to an unacceptable level, their\nchecking is conducted at a considerably higher rate, directly related to the required bandwidth necessary in control to produce the planned gusting rates and accuracies. Outer\nlimits are checked twenty times per second and inner limits once per second unless\nextended duration gusts are being executed; then inner limits are only checked at the\nquarter cycle points.\nTypes of output.- There are three basic types of output available from the monitoring computer:\n\n55\n\n(1) Typed output on teleprinters\n(2) Paper tape output\n(3) Visual display output\nThe first two are produced automatically when a variable exceeds inner limits. The purpose of the typed output is to draw the attention of the test controller to the current test\nsituation, namely, that one or more channels are deviating from their expected conditions,\nso that a close watch can be kept on any developments. If more than a prescribed number of printouts occur, shutdown takes place automatically. This limit would normally be\nset at the number which can be output in any one test cycle so that there is not a steady\naccumulation of results. If the deviation on a channel does not change, it does not repeat\nprintout; thereby, the output capacity is preserved.\nThe paper-tape output provides a record of the exceedances of the inner limits in a\nform which can subsequently be fed to a computer for further analysis.\nThe third form of output is via the visual display which can give rapid access to any\nof the monitored variables at a request through a keyboard input message. Up to two\nvariables may be displayed concurrently against a time axis; and a data table giving the\ncurrent measured values and the expected values of the inner and outer limits may accompany them. It may also be used for the display of logged information if a user program is\nwritten to interface with the display servicing software.\nData Logger\nMultiplexing configuration.- In order to achieve consistent measurements from\nstrain gauges attached to specimens operating in unfavourable conditions, it is necessary\nto avoid pressure-type electrical contacts within the normal bridge measuring system.\nThus small groups of gauges are collected into terminal units in which the bridge is\nformed using all soldered joints. Any initial imbalance of the bridge is catered for by\nextending the range of the recording apparatus. The terminal units are sited as near to\nthe group of gauges as possible to minimise the effects of leads in the arms of the bridge.\nUp to 16 of these terminal units are then collected via cables into a sampling unit where\nthey may be successively sampled by reed switches and the resulting signal amplified\nand fed to the recording console. Each terminal unit may accommodate up to 10 gauges\nwith a further two calibration points available. Similar units containing cold junction\ncompensators are used for collecting thermocouple signals.\nThe main console can accept up to 30 sampling boxes which are sampled through a\nhigh-speed solid-state multiplexer into a successive approximation analogue-to-digital\nconverter. This converts the measured signal into digital form with a resolution of\n12 bits (1 in 4096) when it is then transferred to the PDP10 computer through one of its\ntwo British standard digital data interfaces.\n56\n\nBritish standard interfaces.- Two of these units are attached to the memory buss\nof the PDP10 computer; each is capable of handling 8-bit words at transfer rates of\nmore than 100 kilohertz. One is used for transferring control information to the logger\nmain console while the other collects the resulting data; a useful feature of this arrangement is that the interfaces may be directly linked for fault diagnosis. An extension to the\ninterfaces, on the logger side of them, provides isolation of the logger from the computer\nprocessor through an opto-electronic link for the reasons stated previously.\nBasic operational facilities.- A total scan of all points on all the sampling boxes can\nbe made in 6 seconds. The sampling time on each point is about 30 milliseconds, which is\nachieved by sampling all the sampling boxes concurrently. This concurrent sampling\nallows ample time to filter off any electrical noise at frequencies equal to or higher than\nthe frequency of ac line voltage by a combination of analogue and numerical techniques.\nBy using this method, it is possible to have available in the computer a measure of this\nnoise level on each channel during sampling giving a useful guide to the effectiveness of\nany measurements. The diagnostic capability of the measuring system is further\nextended by having computer controlled grounding alternatives of the strain-gauge\nbridges. By this means it is possible to assess the electrical leakage between the gauge\nand specimen (a common cause of errors in elevated temperature strain measurement).\nIntegration of the logger with the computer gives a high degree of software control\nover its scanning ability from both conversational and preprogrammed input. By using\nthe latter facility, logging can be made synchronous with the process control and loading\nfunctions. Input may be in either logger-channel-number format or gauge-code format.\nVarious types of output are available, their extent only being limited by the ingenuity\nof the programmer and the spare core store. Conversational type input normally results\nin a processed output in engineering terms, rather than machine code. Further processing and analysis of results is possible when the machine is dedicated to this task, that is,\nwhen fatigue cycling is not functioning. Alternatively, the raw data may be output on any\nof the output media to be subsequently processed on another computer.\nOperation for Testing\nStartup and shutdown.- The requirements of both startup and shutdown necessitate\nthat the computer controlled plant be partitioned into blocks that can be independently\nstarted and stopped. Whereas the former state will be initiated by a plant engineer when\nhe considers that the correct conditions have been satisfied, the latter action will normally\nbe taken automatically by the computer or plant hardware. To satisfy these demands,\neach section of the controlled plant is coupled to its appropriate computer and the monitoring computer by an interlock loop which operates as shown by the following example.\n\n57\n\nConsidering one of the external air circuits and assuming that the appropriate background conditioning plant is running and that the K70 and PDP10 computers are operating\nand loaded with their correct programs, the startup sequence commences with the plant\nengineer pushing a button to start the air-circulating fan. If the associated background\nplant is ready, a request will be sent to the PDP10 for permission to start. When the\ncomputer has checked to see if this is a legitimate request, it will start upper limit checking and also relay the request on to the K70 computer. The K70 computer, in turn, will\ncheck for legitimacy and initiate control action at the same time as sending a signal to the\nplant confirming the startup request. The fan should then start; this action will consolidate the engineer\'s request to start and therefore latch the interlock loop. Thereafter, if\neither the plant or the two computers fail to activate the interlock loop, it will open and\nhence produce shutdown of the controlled plant on that loop.\nThe following sections of plant have interlock lines to the computers:\n(1) Each of the external circulating fans\n(2) Each of the internal circuit circulating blowers\n(3) One from the set of pressure blowers\n(4) One from the electrohydraulic loading system\n(5) One from the droop nose system\n(6) Each of the thirteen fuel systems.\nThis partitioning of the plant allows batched shutdowns where, under certain circumstances, only part of the plant is shut down if the outer limits of a monitored variable are\nexceeded.\nData input and cross-checking.- Before a test is started, the input data for control\nand monitoring functions have to be input to the computers. These input data are oriented\ntowards user formats and in engineering units; therefore, they have to be processed to\ncompressed computer formats after initial input. Following this it is necessary to check\nthat the data have been input correctly into the stores of the computers. To facilitate the\noperation, the same data are input to both the control computer and the monitoring computer and then cross-checked through the data link between them. At this point, the monitoring data in the control computer and the control data in the monitoring machine may\nbe discarded.\nAs the load data are input in a derived form, as discussed previously, an additional\nfunction of the programme is to calculate all the jack loads and print them out for comparison with the original data.\nFacilities for commissioning.- The configuration of two control computers was\nadopted to add flexibility for the commissioning stages of the project. Each control com58\n\nputer can be operated independently of the other and of the monitoring computer. Thus,\nfor example, parts of the plant or loading system can be commissioned independently.\nIt would not be desirable however to operate on the specimen without the monitoring computer in use, as the fail-safe properties of the complete system would be absent.\nIn general, the software has been designed to allow almost all the quantitative data\ndefining the conditions of a test cycle to be replaced very quickly. For example, the\nstandard three-term control algorithms available to control the plant may have their\nparameters changed, via the K70 console, by push buttons. Special provisions have also\nbeen made on the loading computer for a conversational type programme to control loads\non up to 10 jacks. With these facilities, it is considered that most of the special problems\nwhich may arise during commissioning can be accommodated.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mann, J.

FROM TESTS CARRIED OUT WITH FORGED\nBEAM AND FRAME STRUCTURES IN THE DEVELOPMENT\nOF THE SAAB AIRCRAFT VIGGEN\nBy S. E. Larsson\nSaab-Scania Aktiebolag\nLinkoping, Sweden\nSUMMARY\nA part of the lower side of the main wing at the joint of the main spar with the\nfuselage frame was investigated. This wing beam area was simulated by a test specimen consisting of a spar boom of AZ 74 forging (7075 aluminum alloy modified with\n0.3 percent Ag) and a portion of a honeycomb sandwich panel attached to the boom\nflange with steel bolts. The cross section was reduced to half scale. However, the\nflange thickness, the panel height, and the bolt size were full scale.\nFurther, left and right portions of the fuselage frame intended to carry over the\nbending moment of the main wing were tested. Each of these "frame halves" consisted of a forward and a rear forging (7079 aluminum alloy, overaged) connected by\nan outer and inner skin (Alclad 7075) creating a box beam. These test specimens\nwere full scale and were constructed principally of ordinary aircraft components.\nThe test load spectrum was common to both types of specimens with regard to\npercentage levels. It consisted of maneuver and gust loads, touchdown loads, and\nloads due to ground roughness. A load history of 200 hours of flight with 15 000 load\ncycles was punched on a tape. The loads were randomized in groups according to the\nflight-by-flight principle. The highest positive load level was 90 percent of limit load\nand the largest negative load was -27 percent. A total of 20 load levels were used.\nBoth types of specimens were provided with strain gages and had a nominal stress of\nabout 300 MN/m 2 in some local areas.\n\nAs a result of the tests, steps were taken to reduce the risk of fatigue damage\nin aircraft. Thus stress levels were lowered, radii were increased, and demands on\nsurface finish were sharpened.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn designing aircraft structures against fatigue, a practice that has been used\nfor many years at Saab can be described as follows: Reasonably low stress levels\nare applied and structural elements and units are carefully shaped on the basis of\n93\n\nload-spectrum estimates, stress analysis, fatigue testing of small specimens, and fatigue\ncalculations. By these means costly fatigue tests on complete aircraft structures have\nbeen avoided.\nAfter thorough consideration, this practice was also applied to the Viggen aircraft.\nLater, however, conditions changed: An extended service life was desired, and the static\nfull-scale test showed a somewhat more severe stress distribution than had been\npredicted \xe2\x80\x94 in the spar boom flanges of the main wing, for example. These new conditions necessitated some sort of fatigue testing in a late development stage. In considering time, cost, the desire for easy repeatable testing, and the possibility of introducing\nmodifications, something intermediate to conventional full-scale testing and simple\n(small-specimen) testing was chosen.\nBefore proceeding with the description of current test specimens and testing, attention should be focused on. the fact that several basic fatigue studies have been done at Saab\nfor use in the design of aircraft structures. A study of fatigue strength of aluminum lugs\n(ref. 1), which was presented at the 4th ICAF Symposium in Munich in 1965, can be mentioned. Block-program fatigue of riveted joints and lugs has been studied in cooperation\nwith The Aeronautical Research Institute of Sweden (FFA). These test results, correlated\nwith experience from the literature, have been the basis for selecting values of E(n/N)\nfor different conditions in designing. The stress engineer looks forward to data based on\nrandomized load testing.\nSYMBOLS AND UNITS\nd\t\n\ndiameter, mm\n\nf\t\n\nlife-reduction scatter factor\n\nKIC\t\n\nplane-strain fracture toughness, N/mm3/2\n\nKt\tstress concentration factor\n1\t\n\nlength of crack, mm\n\n1*\t"total" length of crack (see fig. 20 for defining sketches), mm\nN\t\n\nnumber of cycles to failure at constant stress level\n\nn\t\n\nnumber of cycles applied at constant stress level\n\n94\n\nP\t\n\nload, kN\n\nr\t\n\nnotch radius, mm\n\nT\t\n\ntime, h; equivalent flying time, h\n\nTs\tservice life, h\nt\t\n\nthickness of material, mm\n\nv\t\n\ncrack propagation rate, dl*/dT, mm/h\n\nb\t\n\ndepth of crack, mm\n\n55\t\n\nelongation, percent\n\nP\t\n\nroot radius of milling step mark, mm\n\na\t\n\nnormal stress, MN/m2\n\nomax\t\n\nmaximum value of stress, MN/m2\n\nCrmin\t\n\nminimum value of stress, MN/m2\n\nou\tmaterial ultimate tensile strength, MN/m2\n00.2\t\n\n0.2-percent-offset yield strength, MN/m2\n\nSubscripts:\ny\t\n\nspanwise direction\n\nz\t\n\nvertical direction\n\n95\n\nConversion factors for the units used in this report are given in the following table:\nPhysical quantity\nLength\n\nSI unit\n(*)\nmeter (m)\n\nConversion factor\n(**)\n39.4\n\nForce\n\nnewton (N)\n\n0.225\n0.102\n\nlbf\nkp\n\nStress\n\nMN/m2\n\n0.145\n0.102\n\nksi\nkp/mm2\n\nCustomary unit\nin.\n\n* Prefixes to indicate multiples of units are as follows:\nPrefix\n\nMultiple\n\nmega (M)\nkilo (k)\nmilli (m)\n\n106\n103\n10-3\n\n** Multiply value given in SI units by conversion factor to obtain equivalent value in\ncustomary units.\nAIRCRAFT PARTS AND TEST SPECIMENS\nIn its present design the Saab Viggen is primarily an all-weather attack aircraft.\nIts configuration is unconventional, with one pair of front wings and one pair of main wings.\nFigure 1 shows the location of the parts that have been the object of the investigation\nreported: the wing beam and the fuselage frame in the main-wing region. A rear view of\nthe wing beam and fuselage frame assembly is shown in figure 2.\nA part of the lower side of the main wing at the joint of the main spar with the fuselage frame was investigated. This wing beam area, indicated in figure 2, was simulated\nby test specimens Al, A2, and A3. Section I-I shows the aircraft design in this part, a\nhoneycomb panel joined to the boom flange by steel bolts in two rows.\nLeft and right portions of the fuselage frame intended to carry over the bending\nmoment of the main wing were also tested. These "frame halves" are denoted test specimens BI and B2 in figure 2. Specimens B3 and B4, used in a complementary test going\non when this paper was prepared, are discussed in the appendix. Section II-II in figure 2\nshows the wing joint with the attachment of the two-pronged beam lugs to the forward and\nrear frame forging and to the intermediate part, e. The purpose of the latter component\nis to get some load diffusion in a compact design. Part e is not included in the test speci96\n\nmen but its attachment forces are taken into account. The upper area of the frame, made\nup of separate forgings, was not represented in the test.\nFigure 3 shows a test specimen of type A, consisting of a spar boom of forged AZ 74\n(designation according to Otto Fuchs, Metallwerke, Germany, and equal to 7075 aluminum\nalloy modified with 0.3 percent Ag) and a portion of a honeycomb sandwich panel attached\nto the boom flange with steel bolts in one row. The cross section was reduced to half\nscale. However, the flange thickness, the panel height, and the bolt size were full scale.\nThe first few bolt holes in the boom flange were thought to be the most critical points,\nbut the tests showed the flange notch to be of equal importance.\nThe bolted joint was provided with a sealing compound in the attachment of the panel\nto the boom flange. The bolts (noninterference) were treated with dry MoS 2 . From the\nbeginning the boom was anodized in a chromic acid process over its entire length, but\nlater on, highly stressed areas were modified. They were polished and chromated (in the\naircraft they are also protected by a primer). The primary boom lug for axial loading of\nthe test specimen and the transverse lugs for stabilizing it were not representative of the\naircraft structure. The limit load was 711 kN and the outer force system was\nnonredundant.\nGeometric differences between specimens Al, A2, and A3 will be referred to in the\nreporting of fatigue test results. The test specimen booms were taken from three separate beam forgings in almost correct positions. Their strength properties are shown in\nthe following table (y and z denote spanwise and vertical directions, respectively):\n\nSpecimen\n\n(o0.2)y\nMN/m2\n\n(uu)y\nMN/m 2\n\n(o0.2)z\nMN/m2\n\n(ou)z\nMN/m2\n\nAl\nA2\nA3\n\n496\n\n551\n\n427\n432\n427\n\n491\n507\n497\n\nThe test specimens of type B are shown in figure 4. Each specimen consists of a\nforward and a rear forging of 7079 aluminum alloy, overaged, connected by an outer and\nan inner skin (Alclad 7075) creating a box beam. These test specimens were made up in\nfull scale of essentially ordinary aircraft components.\nThe continuity of the outer skin is broken by a long opening in the joint area for the\ninsert of the wing beam lugs. This is shown in section I-I and view U-II of figure 4. The\ninner skin has openings in the same area for the purpose of load transmission by the linkage system used in testing.\n\n97\n\nThe skin was attached to the forgings mainly by countersunk aluminum screws\ndeveloped for blind attachment of thick skins to extrusions and forgings. The threaded\nscrew holes in the forgings were supposed to be critical points of the fatigue specimen.\nThe countersunk holes in the inside Alclad sheet seemed also to be critical. Test specimens B1 and B2 did not include the intermediate forging (e in fig. 2). However, at the\nattachments a and d the test frames were clamped together with ordinary bolts and special distance elements. The frame forgings were anodized in a chromic acid process.\nThe shear bolts in the principal lug joints (b and c) were mounted with sliced taper\nsleeves in bushings, which were prepared with bonded dry MoS2.\nFor the right "frame half" in figure 4, forces are indicated by arrows in proper\nscale. The applied jack force had a limit load value of 313 kN. The force system was\nchosen so that joint loads correct in value and direction would be simulated at b and c,\nand so that the bending moment would be representative in highly stressed parts of the\nframe assembly.\nThe basic material properties of the forgings of B1 and B2 have not yet been determined. General material properties for 7079, overaged, can be found in the section entitled "Materials and Small-Specimen Testing."\nLOAD SPECTRUM AND TEST PERFORMANCE\nThe load spectrum used in testing is shown in figure 5. This total spectrum, which\nwas used for both type A and type B specimens, includes maneuver and gust loads, touchdown loads, and loads due to ground roughness. Different kinds of loads were originally\npresented in separate load spectra, which made up the basis for computer randomization\nof loads in groups according to the flight-by-flight principle. Both the severeness level\nof the flights and the sequence of the individual loads of the same kind were randomized.\nAn example of load sequences in the randomized flight-by-flight program is shown\nin figure 6. A load history of 200 hours of flight with 15 000 load cycles was punched on\na tape for the purpose of unlimited repetitions. The highest positive load level was\n90 percent of limit load and the largest negative load was -27 percent. A total of 20 load\nlevels were used.\nA diagram of the test equipment is shown in figure 7. This system was based on a\nmodified unit for numerically controlled milling machines, a hydraulic pump with variable\nflow governed by the stroke, hydraulic jacks with low-friction seals of Teflon, and pressure transmitters for controlling the oil pressure in the jacks. The mean value of the\nfrequency was 0.5 cps.\nThe arrangement of test specimens is shown in figure 8. The two test groups A\nand B were loaded by separate jacks that were only hydraulically connected. They could\n98\n\nwork either simultaneously or separately. The somewhat odd link and lever system at the\nleft portion of the frames in figure 8 was made up in order to get a proper redistribution\nof the principal outer reaction force in this part.\nThe test specimens were provided with strain gages for calibration and monitoring\nof loads. Each test started with loading to 90 percent of limit load. This load level will\nalso be applied once during the delivery control flight of every aircraft.\nCrack searches with a fluorescent penetrant ( Ardrox P1) and crack-length studies\nwere performed especially on the A specimens while loaded to 40 percent of limit load.\nA search for new cracks was made every 600 h. Visual observations of crack length\nwere made more frequently but irregularly.\nTEST RESULTS FROM SPECIMEN A (WING BEAM)\nTable I presents a summary of test results from specimens A. The strain gages\n(01, 02, and 03) were applied to specimens Al, A2, and A3 in the same areas. They are,\nhowever, shown only on A2 in figure 10. From the location of the strain gages and the\nvalues in table I(a) the nominal stress at the flange notch and bolt hole 1 is estimated to\nhave been 280 to 300 MN/m 2 at limit load, depending somewhat on definition.\nTable I(b) shows equivalent flying hours (hours read on the punched tape) for observations of the state of cracks. Cracks 11 and 12 occurred in specimen Al, cracks 21, 22,\nand 23 in A2, and cracks 31 and 32 in A3.\nIt can be seen in table I(b) that cracks appeared in specimen Al after only 3400 h.\nThese cracks, no. 11, are shown in figure 9. One crack started where a radius r = 3 mm\ninteracted with the principal notch radius r = 10 mm. Another crack started from the\nopposite side in a rough edge of the notch. Many very small cracks were also found in\nthe anodized surface of the flange notch area.\nThe specimen in this original shape was not quite representative of the aircraft\nstructure, and it became less representative because the specimen was modified to\nremove the cracked material. However, the test was continued in order to study the area\nwith bolt holes in the boom flange \xe2\x80\x94 that area which originally had been thought to be the\nmost critical. For this case the cracked material was milled off, and the shape was modified to that marked with the dashed lines. Besides cracks in areas not considered significant, no new damage was found until crack 12 appeared in bolt hole 1 at about 21 000 h.\nThe test was finished at 24 100 equivalent flight hours without a limiting failure.\nTest specimens A2 and A3 were like the modified form of Al. They were polished\nand chromated in highly stressed boom portions.\n\n99\n\nFigure 10 shows specimen A2 in a late stage with the cracks fully developed.\nCrack 21 was found after 8400 h, when it had a length of 1 = 1 mm. Its slow propagation\nwas studied and it was under control until the test was ended as a result of bolt failure in\nhole 1 at 15 200 h. The crack propagation history can be followed in figure 20 (which\nincludes sketches defining 1 and 6). Figure 11 shows details of the cracked\nspecimen A2.\nFigure 12 shows fully developed cracks in specimen A3. The nature of crack 31\nwas about the same as that of crack 21 in figure 10. Crack 31 was found at 7700 h, when\nit had a length of 1 ^ 5 mm. It propagated somewhat more rapidly than crack 21.\nThe most interesting crack in specimen A3 was the crack designated 32. This\ncrack was seen for the first time at 10 500 h (not seen at crack search 600 h earlier).\nWhen discovered it had a visible length of about 10 mm (about 12 mm was hidden under\nthe panel). From this stage it propagated rapidly (a rate of about 0.02 mm/h) and then\nmore slowly. The same tendency toward crack development from bolt hole 1 can be seen\nin figure 10. The new results, however, are the rapid propagation of crack 32 and the\ncomplicated interaction with crack 31.\nFigure 13 shows the features of the locally developed fatigue fracture surfaces of\nthe cracked area in specimen A3. The slightly concave boom-side surface of crack 32\nis thought to be the result of "Stage I" crack growth according to reference 2. The 450\ndirection is pronounced, and no unusual material properties or defects have been found.\nThe surfaces were rubbed and could not give adequate information. At the stage of figure 13, crack 32 shows a tendency to change over to a 90 0 fatigue fracture. Figure 13\nalso shows that crack 32 must have been present when crack 31 passed through its area.\nThe less interesting surfaces are not numbered.\nThe fatigue test of A3 was finished at 11 700 h by a boom fracture due to fatigue\ncracking from the root of a transverse lug, not significant for the aircraft structure. No\ndamage to the panel could be found in the three specimens tested.\nTEST RESULTS FROM SPECIMEN B (FUSELAGE FRAME)\nTable II presents a summary of test results from specimens B. Strain gages F-01\nand F-02 were located on the forward frame and strain gages R-01 to R-04 were located\non the rear frame. (See fig. 17 and table II(a).) Table H(a) shows frame stresses of\napproximately 260 to 320 MN/m 2 at limit load.\nTable II(b) shows equivalent flying hours for occurrence of cracks and ultimate failure. The letters S, F, and R in the crack designations refer to sheet, forward forging,\nand rear forging, respectively. Cracks 11 to 14 occurred in specimen 131, and cracks 21\nto 23 occurred in specimen B2.\n100\n\nFrom table II(b) it can be seen that cracks appeared at screw holes in the inner\nsheet of the frame assembly after 4300 equivalent flying hours. Their propagation was\nobserved, and in some cases they were stopped by the use of a blind rivet with d = 4.8 mm\nor plug with d = 5 mm (sheet thickness t = 3 mm).\nUltimate failure of specimen B 1 occurred at 5300 h by fracture from an unexpected\nfatigue crack in web O of the rear forging, shown in figure 14. No crack search with\nfluorescent penetrant had been done in this area before failure. Afterward, however, four\nother cracks of about the same kind were indicated in three forgings of specimens B1 and\nB2. The B2 test was also ended. An inspection made clear that the surface finish of the\nweb areas of the milled frame forgings was worse than specified.\nFigure 14 shows test specimen Bl with fatigue cracks and the location of failure\nindicated. Figure 15 shows the fractured area of specimen B l with a sketch of the fatigue\nfracture surface, which represented -390 mm 2 , or ^10 percent of the whole area of the\nsection. Figure 16 shows the surface shape of the fatigue crack that caused failure in Bl.\nIt is representative of a number of web areas in both Bl and B2. The root radius p of\nthe milling step marks was about 0.5 mm.\nFigure 17 shows specimen B2 with the location of cracks and strain gages indicated.\nFigure 18 shows the area with cracks in the inner sheet of the frame assembly. This area\nis not very representative of the aircraft because of the large unreinforced openings.\nWhen the fatigue test was finished, specimen B2 was provided with complementary\nstrain gages for comparison with a simultaneous study of stress levels in a loaded complete fuselage. It was found that the fatigue test specimens had been loaded to stress\nlevels about 20 percent too high in critical areas. The reasons were, in the first place,\nunavoidable differences between specimen and fuselage due to "skin load diffusion conditions," and in the second place, some lack of effectiveness of the frame forgings due to\nbad stabilization of the cross section in bending. A fourth to a half of the 20 percent difference was recovered in a modified set of specimens, B3 and B4, with better stabilization provided by two ordinary bulkheads, reinforcement of the inner skin, and smaller\nopenings for the linkage system. These specimens are discussed in the appendix.\nDISCUSSION\nMaterials and Small-Specimen Testing\nA decision was made to change from the earlier standard aluminum alloy (the overaged 7079 with Saab-Scania designation 3624-5) to AZ 74 (Saab-Scania 3633-5) as material\nfor some primary aircraft forgings. The reason was the better resistance to stress corrosion cracking of the latter alloy. This change was made gradually, and therefore both\n\n101\n\nalloys were used in this investigation. When forgings of AZ 74 were not available for\ntest specimens, the 7079 (overaged) was used.\nThe composition of the alloys and the aging conditions prescribed by Saab-Scania\nstandard specifications are as follows:\nAlloy\n\nZn\n\nMg\n\nCu\n\nAg\n\nAZ 74\n\n6.0\n\n2.5\n\n0.9\n\n0.3\n\n7079 (overaged)\n\n4.3\n\n3.3\n\n0.6\n\nAging\n\nI\t\n\n1200 C for 12 to 24 h and 170 0 C for 4 to 7 h\n1600 C for 8 h\n\nSome material properties from Saab-Scania specifications and mean values from\ntests of specimens from wing beam forgings are shown in the following table (values\nrefer to large-size forgings):\nLongitudinal direction\nAllo y\n\nTransverse direction\n\nQ\nQ\nu\' b 5\' KIC\'\nu\' 6 5\' KIC\'\n0.2\'\nMN/m 2 MN/m 2 0/0 N/mm 3/2 MN/m2 MN/m 2 \xc2\xb0Io N/mm3/2\n\na0.2\'\n\nQ\n\n390\n\n470\n\n440\n\n510\n\n12\n\n430\n\n500\n510\n\n11\n\n450\n\n410\n\n490\n\n10\n\n480\n\n3\n\n440\n\n500\n\n10\n\nPreliminary\nspecification\n\n4\n\n410\n\n6\n\n440\n\n380\n\n7\n\nAZ 74\n\n7079\n(overaged)\n\n1090\n\n1010\n\nSource of\nvalues\n\n850\n\nTest series\n(mean values)\nSpecification,\nt `_ 150 mm\n\n780\n\nTest series\n(mean values)\n\nFrom the fatigue data in figure 19, which are for constant-amplitude tests, it can\nbe seen that AZ 74 has about 10 percent higher fatigue strength than 7079 (overaged).\nThese tests were carried out with small round specimens with diameter d = 8.5 mm\nand notch radius r = 0.65 mm.\nFatigue tests were also carried out with small specimens of various shapes in\norder to study other problems in connection with the main investigation. The aluminum\nblind-screw element used in specimens B (fuselage frame) was tested at constant amplitude in jointlike test pieces. Its fatigue behavior was good at stresses near limit stress\nbut the behavior for long lives should be studied further (with regard to fretting, for\nexample).\n102\n\nThe "hard point effect" at bolt hole 1 in specimens A (wing beam) was simulated in\na test series. A simple program of three-level tests was carried out on plain specimens\n"reinforced" by straps fastened to them with wing-panel attachment bolts. The intent was\nto find the effect of bolt fit in the boom flanges and ballizing of flange holes on the fatigue\nlife. Ballizing was better than "easy" interference fit alone, which was better than the\noriginal small-clearance fit. However, differences were small and no change of design\nprinciple was made.\nCrack Propagation and Fractures\nPropagation of the cracks in the AZ 74 boom flanges of specimens A 2 and A3\n(cracks 21 and 31) is shown in figure 20. Values of 1 * (total visible crack length) were\nplotted against the number of equivalent flying hours T. The dashed lines make up a\nmean curve, visually estimated. This curve indicates that crack propagation, on the average, might be slow between T = 7000 h and T = 11 000 h. The mean crack propagation\nrate is v l = 0.0025 mm/h in this time interval. (Environmental conditions, not considered in the tests, must also be accounted for when estimating the probable damage tolerance of the aircraft structure.)\nThe crack in specimen A 3 that caused the ultimate failure of the boom section at a\nnonrepresentative transverse lug had a fatigue-cracked area of =650 mm 2 , or --25 percent\nof the total boom cross section. The residual strength of this section, when it failed ultimately at 83.5 percent of limit load, and that of the cracked area in specimen B1, when it\nfractured at 90.1 percent of limit load, have been controlled with respect to fracture\ntoughness behavior. Current combinations of stress levels, geometry, and K IC values\n(from the table of material properties presented previously) could in both cases explain\nactual failures.\nSurface Conditions and Damage\nSome problems with surface roughness and anodizing as detrimental factors in\nfatigue of wing beam specimen Al were reported. Fretting was found in the boom flange\nof specimens A in bolt holes and on the surface that makes contact with the panel. Mainly,\nhowever, the fatigue quality of the bolt-hole area of the flange was as good as wanted. The\ndry film lubricant and the sealing compound have certainly been positive factors.\nThe main surface problem with the frame specimens B 1 and B2 was the milling step\nmarks shown in figure 16. In highly stressed areas, these milling marks and other surface imperfections on parts of the aircraft were eliminated by surface-improving procedures followed by adequate corrosion protection.\n\n103\n\nThe test of specimen Al and other recent tests indicated that serious fatigue problems are sometimes associated with anodizing on aluminum parts. Thorough studies of\nthese problems are being made.\nCalculation Study\nA recently developed computer method for fatigue calculations based on the linear\ncumulative damage theory was tested on specimens A and B and their fatigue-test results.\nThe diagram in figure 21 shows calculated S-N curves for various K t values based on\nthe constant-amplitude fatigue data from figure 19, slightly reduced. The curves in figure 21 are for the specimen A material, AZ 74, the test load spectrum, and E(n/N) = 1.\nThe nominal stress at limit load is plotted against calculated equivalent flying hours. The\nfatigue test result, Q = 290 MN/m 2 and T = 9000 h, is plotted and found to correspond\nto Kt = 2.7. (The chosen time, 9000 h, corresponds to a 5-mm fatigue crack in the flange\nnotch, according to the mean curve in figure 20. This time, however, is also supposed to\nbe representative for the bolt-hole cracks.)\nThe value Kt = 2.7 is larger than expected for the flange notch, but less than\nexpected for the first and second bolt holes. This calculated result and the corresponding\nresult for specimen B (overaged 7079 and rougher surface in the web case) are shown in\nthe following table:\n\nSpecimen\n\nStress at\nlimit load,\na, MN/m2\n\nA\n\n290\n\n9000\n\n2.7\n\nFlange notch and bolt holes\n\n280\n\nz5000\n\n2.4\n\nWeb Ol\n\n310\n\n>5000\n\n<2.4\n\nT, hr\n\nKt\n\nLocation of crack\n\nB\nForging inner boom\n\nIt should be noted that in the case of residual tensile stresses from heat treatment\nand material removal by machining, the calculation result K t = 2.4 for the frame forging\nweb will be changed. The fatigue failure corresponds to Kt = 2.0 if a residual tensile\nstress of 50 MN/mm 2 is assumed. Thus, residual tensile stresses in forgings may play\na role not only in stress corrosion damage but also in fatigue life.\nStress Concentrations\nProblems caused by interacting stress concentrations frequently occur in connection\nwith forging design. Interacting notch radii in critical areas have been observed in both\nspecimens A and B.\n104\n\nIn order to get a better collection of data as a basis for design and for making up\nsome estimation rules, fatigue testing has been performed and is planned to progress with\nspecimens of various shapes. Figure 22 shows two typical configurations, representing\nthe. problem of a hole in a radius (bolt hole in a part with variable cross section) and the\nproblem of simultaneous area variation in perpendicular planes.\nReduction Factor on Life\nWhen testing a small number of safe-life aircraft components with proper load history, a life-reduction scatter factor of f = 4 is often applied to the mean test life. If\nspecimen A, the wing-beam part of this investigation, is studied in this way, an overall\nservice life under current test conditions can be determined. Specimen Al, which was\nnot representative in the flange notch area, is neglected in spite of its information about\nfatigue life of the bolt-hole flange area. The mean value obtained from specimens A2 and\nA3 is\nT = 2 (15 200 + 11 700) = 13 450 h\n(In fact, the life of A3 is based on a secondary-type failure.) Reduction with a factor\nf = 4 gives an overall service life of\nT s = 4(13 450) = 3360 h\nThe crack propagation rate is larger outdoors than indoors, as was observed by\nSchijve and De Rijk in tests on sheet specimens of 7075-T6 (ref. 3). This fact could be\naccounted for by using a higher reduction factor on the average time during which visible\ncracks exist; for example, f = 6 on the time after T = 7000 h (fig. 20) :\nTs = 4(7000) + 6(13 450 - 7000)\nT s = 1750 + 1075 = 2825 h\nApplication of test results for wing-beam specimens of type A to the real wing-beam\nstructure of aircraft must take into consideration differences in geometry, size, and so\nforth. The real aircraft structure has greater three-dimensional complexity than the\nspecimens. Therefore stress levels can differ and new points may be critical. In proper\ndesign, however, constraints reduce secondary deformations, make section areas more\neffective, and usually lower the stresses.\n105\n\nThe half-scale cross section tested had full-scale flange thickness, panel height,\nand bolt diameter. However, the two rows of bolts actually used for panel attachment\nwere simulated with one row only, which must be conservative according to flange bending\nbehavior. The testing of specimens B 1 and B 2 happened to be more conservative than was\noriginally intended (higher stresses). Consequently the fatigue life became short and further study of it by use of such things as reduction factors is without meaning.\nC ONC LUSIONS\nThe test method has turned out rather well and can be looked upon as an inexpensive\nand flexible alternative to conventional full-scale fatigue testing, for the purpose of structural development. However, specimens must be very carefully designed in order to represent actual load distribution on aircraft parts.\nThe fluorescent penetrant effectively indicated cracks at 40 percent of limit load,\nthe inspection load used in this test.\nThe test results for type A (wing beam) specimens indicate an overall service life\nof 3360 hours if a scatter factor of 4 is applied on the mean total test life of two specimens. Many other factors, such as geometry, scale factor, and environment, could be\ntaken into consideration.\nThe specimens of type B (fuselage frame) sustained a shorter total test life than the\nwing beam specimens. However, comparison with strain measurements on a complete\nfuselage showed the stress levels of the frame specimens to be too high. Further, the\nsurface finish of the milled frame forgings happened to be worse than what is normally\npermitted. A new test with slightly modified specimens and load levels is going on with\nanother two frame halves.\nAttention has been focused on the problems of anodizing, surface roughness, interacting stress concentrations, and fretting.\nAs a result of the tests, steps were taken to reduce the risk of fatigue damage in\naircraft. Thus, stress levels were lowered, radii were increased, and demands on surface finish were sharpened.\n\n106\n\nAPPENDIX\nWORK IN PROGRESS\nA complementary fatigue test with "frame half" specimens B3 and B4, indicated in\nfigure 2, is in progress as this paper is being prepared. These specimens also have\nforgings of 7079 (overaged). They are, relative to B1 and B2, constructed with better\nstabilization of the frame parts by two ordinary bulkheads, with reinforcement of the inner\nskin, and smaller openings for the linkage system. They are also polished in critical\nforging areas.\nThe test load spectrum has been slightly changed according to new conditions. Further, critical stresses are lowered 5 to 10 percent by a more favorable stress distribution in the modified specimen and 12 percent by a decrease of the jack load over the entire\nspectrum. Consequently, the total lowering is =20 percent. All these changes have been\nmade in order to get a better load distribution with more correct stress levels for the\nproper simulation of aircraft structural fatigue conditions.\n\n107\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author is indebted to Saab-Scania Aktiebolag for permission to prepare and\npublish this paper.

Spencer\nThe Boeing Company\nEverett, Washington, U.S.A.\n\nCq\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Boeing 747 is designed and certified as a fail-safe airplane. (See ref. 1.)\nThe fatigue integrity program was established to insure economic operations and to\nprovide foundation data for inspection and maintenance. Significant features of the\n747 fatigue integrity program are\n1. Fatigue analyses which are continually updated to reflect design changes,\nfatigue test results, and static and flight load survey measurements\n2. Material selection and detail design by using initial fatigue analyses, service experience, and testing\n3. Fatigue testing to check detail design quality and to verify the analyses,\nculminated by the test of a structurally complete airframe\nThese three features are interrelated during all program phases of conception, design,\ndesign check, production, and operation.\nDesired fatigue reliability levels are established by using data from statistical\nstudies on military as well as commercial fleets. Appropriate fatigue reliability factors (scatter factors) are considered in the fatigue life evaluations. Essential fatigue\nanalysis factors are fatigue loading environment, load-stress relationships, fatigue\nperformance data (S-N curves), and cumulative damage theory.\nThe 747 fatigue loading environments were established by using NASA, military,\nand Boeing data, in conjunction with aircraft aerodynamics and loads data, customer\nroute structure analyses, and flight load surveys. Because of the airplane size and\nthe complex landing-gear system, the 747 ground-handling and landing load spectra\nreceived special attention.\nFatigue stress analyses were performed with the aid of experimental as well as\nanalytical procedures. Extensive application was made of the stress severity factor,\ndeveloped at Boeing, for evaluating peak stresses in complex joints.\nA frame of reference was established by families of structural fatigue performance curves (S-N curves) encompassing the range of materials and fatigue qualities\nanticipated for the 747 airplane design. Modifications to the endurance limit and the\nlow-stress region of the curves were made by using service experience and structural\n127\n\ncomponent and full-scale fatigue tests. These modifications were necessary to account\nfor the inherent shortcoming of Miner\'s method for predicting fatigue life for spectrumloaded structures by using constant-amplitude generated S-N curves.\nEach family of fatigue performance curves was assigned a fatigue quality identified\nby a fatigue performance index (FPI). The FPI of structural details was estimated by a\nsemiempirical relationship.\nThe most significant factors in attaining satisfactory fatigue quality are detail design\nand material selection. From previous airplane experience and initial fatigue analyses,\nmaterial was selected which satisfied the static, fatigue, and fail-safe requirements.\nCareful consideration to detail design with respect to fatigue and fail safety was given to\nall primary structural components.\nAll major details on the airplane were analyzed by using the technique outlined\nabove. These analyses were verified by extensive full-scale and component tests.\nFatigue developmental and verification tests conducted specifically for the 747 airplane\nincluded\nQuonset-hut tests\nWing, body, and nose landing-gear testz\nOutboard-flap functional and fatigue tests\nFull-scale horizontal-tail tests\nFuselage crown stringer splice tests\nSide-of-body rib-component tests\nNumerous small-scale specimen tests concerning \xe2\x80\x93\nShot peening\nFastener development\nCold working\nWing\xe2\x80\x94side-of-body joint configuration\nWindow forging configurations\nIn addition, a full-scale airplane fatigue test is in progress. This test utilizes a\nflight-by-flight load spectrum including pressure cycles applied in a manner to represent\nthe fatigue loading during a typical flight. The test objectives are to\n1. Locate any fatigue-critical areas early in production\n2. Provide test data for analytical service-life prediction\n\n128\n\n3. Help develop inspection and maintenance procedures\n4. Evaluate fail-safe characteristics of major structural components and\nassemblies\nThe 747 fatigue integrity program provides a high degree of confidence in the ability\nof the structure to withstand service loads. Safe and economic operation is insured by\nthe continual updating of analyses to reflect design changes and fatigue test results.\nSYMBOLS\nD\t\n\ndrag load\n\nd\t\n\ndiameter, inches\n\nFMEAN mean stress\ng\t\n\nacceleration due to gravity\n\nKt\t\n\nstress concentration factor\n\nKt,b\n\nbearing stress concentration factor\n\nKt I g\n\ngross-area stress concentration factor\n\nOP\n\nload transferred\n\nP - OP\n\nbypass load\n\nS\n\nside load\n\nT\n\ntorque\n\nt\n\nthickness, inches\n\nV\n\nvertical load\n\nw\n\nwidth, inches\n\nC1\n\nhole condition factor\n129\n\n0\t\n\nhole filling factor\n\n77\t\n\nsemispan station measured from root (see fig. 6)\n\n6\t\n\nbearing distribution factor\n\na\t\n\nstress\nABBREVIATIONS\nairplane\n\nAIRP, A/P\nBS\n\nbody station\n\nt\n\ncenter line\n\nDMF\n\ndynamic magnification factor\n\nFLT\n\nf light\n\nFPI\n\nfatigue performance index\n\nFRF\n\nfatigue reliability factor\n\nFWD\n\nforward\n\nGAG\n\nground air ground\n\nGRND\n\nground\n\nIHL\n\nintermittent high loads\n\nINBD\n\ninboard\n\nLE\n\nleading edge\n\nMED\n\nmedium\n\nML\n\nmarker loads\n\n130\n\nOUTBD\t\n\noutboard\n\nSL\t\n\nsea level\n\nSSF\t\n\nstress severity factor\n\nTE\t\n\ntrailing edge\n\nW/O\t\n\nwithout\n\nFS\t\n\nforward spar\n\nSTA\t\n\nstation\n\nUNSYM\t\n\nunsymmetrical\nAPPROACH\n\nThe service-life objective of current Boeing commercial airplanes is 20 years. In\npursuing this objective on the 747, a program consisting of analysis, material selection\nand detail design, and testing has been followed. There is an obvious overlap and interdependence of these elements in design, development, and maintenance of aircraft. Delineation of specific subelements, such as analysis or testing, is done simply to affirm that\nmany techniques may be used in designing for fatigue and to emphasize that several techniques have been applied in parallel as a check-and-balance approach on the 747.\nAnalysis\nEssential fatigue analysis factors include fatigue loading environment, load-stress\nrelationships, fatigue performance data (S-N curves), and a cumulative damage theory.\nIn defining expected aircraft fatigue loading, both usage (flight profiles) and environment\n(gust, maneuver, etc.) are required (table 1). Fatigue loadings were established by using\nmilitary, NASA, and Boeing data for taxi, gust, maneuver, landing, and ground-handling\nenvironments. A peak-to-peak definition of the ground-air-ground cycle was used.\nExtensive route structure analysis of expected 747-100 operation resulted in the\nflight length distribution illustrated in figure 1 and a 20-year usage goal of 60 000 hours\nfor each airplane. To encompass the wide range of flight lengths from this study, the\nflight profiles shown in figure 2 were developed. The average flight length of the three\nsimulated commercial flights is 3 hours, the average expected over a 20-year service\n131\n\nlife. Four percent of the total 60 000 hours usage is expected to be consumed in training\nand is represented for analysis by 600 4-hour, zero-payload flights, also shown in\nfigure 2.\n\nFuel consumption data are applied to all flight profiles to determine gross-weight\nvariation within each flight. Each flight is subsequently divided into appropriate segments\nas shown in figure 3. Climb and descent portions of the flight are actually covered by\nnumerous altitude segments to account for the very large variation in gust environment\nstatistics with altitude. Flight mean loads, dynamic response to gust, and response to\nmaneuver are determined from aeroelastic analysis for each flight segment.\nAnalytical techniques include engineering theory and finite-element methods; experimental techniques include photostress and strain gages. These analytical and experimental techniques are used to convert external airplane loads into the stresses required\nfor fatigue analysis: 1g stress, stress response to gust, and stress response to maneuver. In addition to conventional stress analysis, the stress-severity-factor technique is\nused (ref. 2). This technique was developed primarily to evaluate load and stress distributions in multifastened joints. It is also used to locate fatigue-critical locations, establish fatigue performance estimates, and evaluate possible design improvements. The\nstress severity factor includes the effects of geometric stress concentration factor Kt,\nfastener load distribution, type of fastener, bearing stress distribution, hole surface condition, and residual stresses. The equation for the stress severity factor is\nSSF = \'peak\n\'ref\n1\n\nR\n\n\'ref [load transfer + cbypass]01\n\nP - OP\t\na\nP\t\n_ 1\n^td\t Kt,bB + tw K t g]a\n\'ref\n\nBecause of its ease of application and relatively good agreement in analyzing airplane structure (ref. 3), Miner\'s theory of cumulative damage is used. Two shortcomings of Miner\'s method have been observed in laboratory testing. One is the inability to\naccount for damage from stress amplitudes below the constant-amplitude endurance limit:\nthe other is the so-called sequence effect where in block-type loading, a substantial difference in life has been observed in some tests in which the order of application of high\nand low load blocks has been varied. The second shortcoming is somewhat academic for\n132\n\nevaluating flight structure since relatively few parts, if any, are subjected to two-step\nhigh-low or low-high block loads in service. The sequence effect is of course very real\nin simulated flight testing and is the primary reason that flight-by-flight testing is\npreferred.\nTo correct Miner\'s method to account for damage below the constant-amplitude\nendurance limit, two techniques are available. One is simply to translate (reduce) the\nS-N curve linearly on life at each alternating stress level (ref. 4). The other is to\nreshape (change the slope of) the S-N curve. The latter course has been followed in\nthis work and is illustrated in figure 4. The level to which the S-N curves have been\nreduced at infinite life is the nonpropagating crack threshold stress. The shape and\nlocation of the upper portion of the S-N curve are essentially unaltered, which retains\nthe advantage of fatigue quality determination from constant-amplitude testing. The\nresulting curves, which are then termed fatigue performance curves, are mathematically\ndefined with a Stuessi type equation (ref. 5) and verified with fleet analysis and flight-byflight spectrum tests.\nIn the early stages of airplane configuration development (prior to built-up structure tests), the fatigue quality of a given design may not be known with high confidence.\nTo preclude having to rerun fatigue analysis whenever a slight change in detail geometry\nis made, as well as to provide a frame of reference for fleet analysis, a family of fatigue\nperformance curves was developed for each of the materials used on the 747. The reference curve for each was that for basic structure (which is defined as skin-stringer\nconstruction having no significant load transfer between skin and stringer). The basicstructure curve was based on built-up structure fatigue performance data which were\navailable for the material and type of construction in question. It should be noted that\nsimple coupon (Kt) data are not used to estimate life of aircraft structure directly (refs. 6\nto 9). With the basic-structure curve as a reference, the remainder of the family of\nfatigue performance curves for each material was developed by using the variation of\nlife with quality from past tests (refs. 10, 11, and 12).\nThe term used to identify fatigue quality is the fatigue performance index (FPI), and\neach of the many curves is identified with a fraction corresponding to the familiar 1/Kt\nform. (Basic structure, for example, was initially identified as FPI = 1/2.5.) An example of curves used for analysis of a given detail is shown in figure 5. Fatigue analyses\nconducted in this manner are essentially parametric studies of life as a function of quality. A sufficient number of analyses are conducted to bracket the expected fatigue quality.\nCurves developed in this way, for fatigue performance indices of 0 to 1, and for each\nmaterial, were mathematically defined and programed for computerized fatigue analysis.\nTechniques for estimating fatigue quality involved stress-severity-factor analysis,\nprevious airplane tests, or fleet data. The factors accounted for in the estimating tech133\n\nnique are geometric stress concentration, load transfer, type of fastener (interference,\ndesign, and modulus of elasticity), bearing stress distribution, hole surface condition,\nresidual stresses, and material. Constants were determined which provided the best fit\nof estimated life versus test- or fleet-demonstrated life from approximately 2000 assessments. The sequence of analysis, test, and fatigue performance estimation is discussed\nin the section entitled "Typical Results."\nFigure 6 illustrates the scope of the fatigue analyses conducted on basic structures,\nand figure 7 illustrates typical details selected for analysis.\nFatigue reliability factors (scatter factors) accounting for fatigue performance\nvariability, possible load environment variability, and the number of tests conducted on\nrepresentative built-up structures are included in each basic structure or detail fatigue\nanalysis. The magnitudes of the fatigue reliability factors varied from 2 to 4, with 4\nbeing used in preliminary analysis when the least built-up structure data were available,\nand 2 being used when large numbers of representative built-up structure tests were\ncompleted.\nMaterials Selection and Detail Design\nThis facet of the 747 fatigue integrity program is intended to cover fatigue improvement activities which parallel the basic analysis. Fleet experience, for example, can\nplay a major role in complementing preliminary fatigue analysis, that is, as a check and\nbalance. Fleet experience with similar parts can augment conventional fatigue analysis,\nprovide positive assessment of detail design quality, even derive new model fatigue performance providing usage, stress, and detail design are not substantially different.\nDuring the design stage, guides for satisfactory fatigue design (or at least guides\nfor identification of possible problems such as given in ref. 13) are of value. The best\nexperience of course is fleet experience, and listings of previous industry airplane problems (cause and effect) were used as design background on the 747. These types of activities, together with preliminary fatigue analysis, resulted in numerous design improvements, a few of which are shown in figures 8, 9, and 10, and in the following materials\nsection:\nWing lower surface \xe2\x80\x94 2024 skin and stiffeners\nWing upper surface \xe2\x80\x94 7075 skin and stiffeners\nBody skin \xe2\x80\x94 primarily 2024\nBody frames and stiffeners \xe2\x80\x94 7075\nEmpennage \xe2\x80\x94 7075\n\n134\n\nLanding gear \xe2\x80\x94 primarily 4340 steel heat-treated to yield an ultimate strength\nvarying from 270 to 300 ksi\nForgings \xe2\x80\x94 7075-T73 (stress corrosion is a prime consideration)\nTesting\nAnalysis and past experience are very important in establishing preliminary design\ngeometries, materials, and allowable stress levels. The proof of fatigue quality, however,\nmust come from test or flight experience. Since the objective of the fatigue integrity\nprogram is to minimize early flight fatigue experience (i.e., cracks), early testing is a\nkey element (refs. 14 and 15). An extensive verification test program was conducted on\nrepresentative sections of the entire airplane (figs. 11 to 17) . All these test structures\nwere constructed with the same finishes, fasteners, and geometries as were planned for\nproduction airplanes. Both constant-amplitude and flight-by-flight spectrum tests were\nrun. In addition to the panel and pressurized fuselage test program summarized in figures 11 to 17, numerous small-scale development-type tests were conducted. Majorcomponent tests, including landing gears, trailing-edge flaps, and horizontal stabilizer,\nare discussed in the section entitled "Tests of Major Components." The culmination of\nthe 747 fatigue test program is the full-scale fatigue test, which is discussed subsequently.\nTYPICAL RESULTS\nTypical of the analyses conducted on the airplane is that shown in figure 18. This\nparticular analysis was conducted for three fatigue qualities and included a fatigue reliability factor (FRF) of 4.0. The analysis illustrates variation of life with spanwise and\nchordwise location as well as the approximate quality required to achieve the fatigue life\ngoal of 60 000 hours.\nTypical test quality determination is illustrated in figure 19, where fatigue quality\nis plotted against cycles to first crack. The quality associated with the number of cycles\nendured at the listed stress state is 0.361, or in 1/Kt form, FPI = 1/2.77. This quality, incidentally, is very near the initial quality estimated for basic structure FPI = 0.4\nor 1/2.5 and is near the upper end of the qualities for which the analysis in figure 17 was\nconducted.\nApplication of test-determined quality and a revised fatigue reliability factor\nFRF = 2.95 (which is appropriate after additional testing) results in the estimated fleet\nfatigue performance of stringer runouts shown in figure 20.\nAdditional examples of the type of data available from fatigue analyses are shown in\nfigures 21, 22, and 23. Since several flights were included in the basic definition of usage,\n135\n\nparametric-type analyses illustrating the influence of flight length on fatigue life are\navailable. These particular analyses have been useful in assessing fatigue life of\n747 derivatives for different kinds of usage, especially short-range operation. Zones\nof life deficiencies and stress reductions or quality improvements required to achieve\nappropriate life goals for 1-hour average flight operation, for instance, are also fallouts\nof basic airplane analysis.\nTESTS OF MAJOR COMPONENTS\nMajor-component tests include: nose, wing, and body landing gears, horizontal\nstabilizer, and outboard trailing-edge flap. Photographs and descriptions of landing-gear\ntest specimens are given in figure 24. In order to represent flight airplane structure,\ntest specimens are production parts and jig structure is designed to simulate the flexibility of airplane support structure. These specimens are subjected to block-type loadings\nshown in figures 25, 26, and 27. Each block consists of loadings equivalent to 1000 flights,\n5 percent of the one lifetime goal of 20 000 flights. The numerous environmental conditions included in analysis and test of each gear are also listed on the respective figures.\nThe outboard-flap test is illustrated in figure 28. The test consisted of stress\nsurveys, functional testing in which the flap was raised and lowered 5000 times, and\nfatigue testing the outboard flap in the fully extended position. The inboard flap and\nleading-edge flaps are tested in the fatigue test on the full-scale airplane.\nThe horizontal stabilizer is tested separately from the full-scale airplane fatigue\ntest primarily to avoid the complication of meshing with fin load systems (fig. 29). Since\nthe stabilizer is mounted in a determinate manner on two hinges and a jackscrew, a fully\nrepresentative load spectrum can be applied in both the full-scale test, through dummy\nstabilizer structure, and the separate test. An added advantage is that the stabilizer test\ncan then be conducted at a faster rate. To allow for the fin-empennage airload interaction\nwith the stabilizer, the vertical gust loads are applied in both separate and full-scale tests\nwith a \xc2\xb120-percent asymmetry. Derived spectrum loads are applied to the inboard and\noutboard elevators on the left side and through dummy elevators on the right side. Additional elevator loads representing take-off rotation and climb rotation are applied in the\ntake-off phase, and loads representing spoiler trim and landing flare are applied in the\nlanding phase.\nFATIGUE TEST OF FULL-SCALE AIRPLANE\nGeneral Description of Specimen and Test Rig\nThe culmination of the test phase of the fatigue integrity program is the fatigue test\nof the full-scale airplane (fig. 30). The test specimen is a structurally complete airframe\n136\n\nof typical production configuration. Omitted are main and nose landing gears, trailingedge flaps except left-hand inboard, leading-edge flaps except left-hand flap numbers 3,\n7, and 12, ailerons, spoilers, engine pod, and the horizontal stabilizer, which is tested\nseparately. Loads are applied through representative dummy structures for the major\ncomponents omitted from the test.\nLoads are applied to the airplane by using 86 hydraulic actuators, which are controlled by an automatic closed-loop electro-hydraulic servo system. The command or\nprogram signal is supplied to the servo systems by a digital programer. This programer\nand the data acquisition functions for the test are controlled by a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 computer. The computer is also used to automate many of the operating\nfunctions of the test.\nTo prevent the test specimen from being loaded to levels that are outside defined\ntolerances, a lockup manifold is installed on each hydraulic actuator. When the lockup\nsystem is actuated, the actuator holds the load at the limit of present tolerances until\nproblem correction. Stainless-steel safety links are included in all load systems attached\nto the airplane. These are designed to yield before local airplane structure is damaged\nby inadvertent overloading. There is also a two-way relief valve installed in each load\nsystem to limit actuator pressure and thereby prevent an overload.\nLoad Spectrum Derivation\nThe main purpose of the airplane fatigue test is to better determine the true structural fatigue performance by eliminating most of the assumptions which are necessary in\nthe analysis. The specific objectives of the test are to locate as quickly as possible any\nfatigue-critical areas with a program accurately representing typical service loads, to\nprovide test data for analytical service life predictions, to help develop inspection and\nmaintenance procedures for the airlines, and to evaluate fail-safe characteristics of\nmajor structural parts. Criteria considered in developing the load spectrum are\nFlight-by-flight testing\nAverage of mixture of flights used as base\nMatch upper surface ground-air-ground stresses\nMatch upper surface taxi damage\nMatch lower surface flight segment damage distribution\nMatch lg stresses in 3-hour flight\nEquivalent gust and maneuver cycles\nOne lateral cycle for one vertical cycle in flight segments\n137\n\nLateral-load cycles quarter of a cycle out of phase with vertical-load cycles\nRepresentative cabin pressurization and depressurization\nAverage flap utilization\nMean engine thrust in each flight segment\nEquivalent landing-gear loads in ground-handling phase\nIntermittent high loads and marker loads\nTo give the correct combination of spectrum loads, cabin pressure, and ground-airground cycle loads, the test is conducted on a flight-by-flight basis. An average flight\nbased on the mixture of four analysis flights is used for deriving the test program. For\nconvenience, damage in the average flight is factored by 19 800/20 000 = 0.99 to give\n20 000 average flights in 60 000 hours of service. Therefore, each test spectrum represents 3 hours of flying in the mixture of flights.\nFrom the derived gust, maneuver, and taxi damage in each flight segment, the\nrequired test cycles are found by using the appropriate stresses from the 3-hour flight\n(fig. 2).\nIncremental stresses due to gust or maneuver and the relationship between gust\nspeed and airplane acceleration differ for each component. Therefore, the damage due\nto gust and maneuvers is considered independently and is applied to each component with\nrepresentative loads. Equivalent gust loads are factored by appropriate dynamic magnification factors.\nOn the basis of aircraft industry experience, both wing upper and wing lower surfaces are of fatigue concern. Therefore, a load program is derived which is representative for both surfaces. The wing upper surface GAG cycle (which is given by the cycle\nfrom the maximum once-per-flight tension stress on the ground, to the maximum onceper-flight compression stress in the air, to the maximum once-per-flight tension stress\non the ground) damage is matched by a slightly modified GAG cycle for the 3-hour flight.\nThis modification limits the maximum allowable tension stress in the taxi segment. To\nreduce the number of cycles, the mean stress in the taxi is reduced below the 1g level\nallowing a higher alternating stress. With this additional variable the required number\nof cycles, which was fixed at five, can be matched. Having fixed the upper surface GAG\ncycle stresses and matched the taxi damage, 97 percent of the total upper surface damage\nis matched.\n, For the wing lower surface, the GAG cycle gives approximately 30 percent of the\ntotal damage. The lower surface taxi damage corresponds to the cycles already determined for the upper surface. The small difference between the analysis and test taxi\ndamage is corrected in the GAG cycle damage to give the correct total damage. The\n138\n\nlower surface GAG stresses are determined by the same method used for the upper surface. With a representative Ig stress in each flight segment, the maximum allowable\nalternating stress, and hence the maximum equivalent alternating cycle, is limited by the\nGAG cycle stresses. To achieve the best damage match at other locations, the maximum\nGAG stresses are fixed in the same flight segments as the analysis. Maximum upper surface tension and lower surface compression stresses occur in the taxi segments. The\nmaximum upper surface compression stress occurs in the hold segment, and the maximum lower surface tension stress occurs during flaps-down climb. Gust and maneuver\ndamage is matched in each segment by finding the minimum number of cycles based on\nthe 1g and GAG stress limitations.\nFigure 31 illustrates the vertical-load program derived for the wing. Fuselage\nvertical loads correspond to the gust, maneuver, and taxi loads derived similarly to those\nfor the wing. Since it is impractical to load all the passenger and cargo floor, representative loads are applied in fore, mid, and aft body locations. The numerous other load\nspectra and the approximate phasing with vertical loads are shown in figure 32. For reference purposes, the average 3-hour flight is subdivided into eleven phases, shown by\nRoman numerals.\nFor the lateral-load program, the load magnitude is found by matching the damage\nin each segment with the same number of cycles as the vertical-load program. In the\nsegments with an even number of cycles, half the cycles are applied with a gust load distribution and half with maneuver load distribution. The cycles in the other segments are\narranged so that the total flight damage is half gust and half maneuver.\nAdditional discrete rudder loads which occur during take-off, flap extension,\napproach, and landing roll-out are applied during phase I for convenience. It is considered unlikely that the maximum lateral loads generally occur at the same time as the\nmaximum vertical loads. Therefore, the lateral-load cycles are applied one-quarter of\na cycle out of phase with the vertical-load cycles. This means the peak lateral load\noccurs with 1g vertical load and the maximum and minimum vertical loads occur with\nzero lateral load.\nCabin pressure differential varies from zero to 0.6 psi in phase IV, from 0.6 linearly to 9.0 psi in phase V, is constant at 9.0 psi in phases VI and VII, varies from 9.0\nlinearly to 0.6 psi in phase VIII, is constant at 0.6 psi in phase IX, and varies from 0.6 psi\nto zero in phase X.\nLoads representing an average utilization are applied to the leading-edge (LE) and\ntrailing-edge (TE) flaps. On the leading edge the loads are applied to flaps 3, 7, and 12\non the left-hand side. The remaining flap loads are applied through dummy flaps with\nrepresentative loads on the support structure. Loads on trailing-edge flaps are applied\nto the inboard flap on the left side with the remaining loads applied to the tracks through\n139\n\ndummy flaps. Most of the damage to TE flaps occurs during approach with the flaps fully\nextended. Therefore, the test loads are applied with the flaps in the extended position.\nAn equivalent load cycle is applied in phase III to represent the damage in the most critical track and carriage sections during take-off with flaps at 15 0 . In the analysis of the\nprimary structure on the LE flaps, most of the damage occurs during take-off. The maximum flap load during take-off occurs with the flaps extended at the end of the take-off\nrotation. Therefore, the test loads are applied with the flaps in the extended position.\nAn equivalent cycle is applied during the approach in phase X. When the LE flaps are\nretracted, the uplock load exceeds all the 1g, gust, and maneuver airloads. Therefore\nno loads are applied on the leading-edge flaps during the remaining flight stages. To\nrepresent the uplock stress which occurs during flight and the two cycles during ground\nhandling, three equivalent load cycles are applied in phase I.\nMean fore and aft nacelle loads in the 3-hour flight are applied in each phase. Maximum gross thrust during take-off and reverse thrust during landing are applied in\nphases III and IX, respectively.\nLanding-gear loads in an average flight are applied through dummy gears to the\nlanding-gear support structure. The dummy gear has a representative relative stiffness\nto give a true load distribution. In phase I ground handling the vertical, fore and aft, and\nside loads are based on the same criteria used to derive the separate landing-gear test\nprogram. The main difference between the two tests is the block loading in the gear test,\nwhich has 1000 flights in each test spectrum and flight-by-flight loading in the airplane\nfatigue test. Vertical loads in phase H taxi correspond to the loads derived for the wing.\nAverage spinup and springback loads are applied in phase XI landing.\nThe spectrum applied on the airplane fatigue test represents typical loads which\noccur in an average flight. In addition to these loads, the airframe is subjected to infrequent high loads during the 60 000-hour life of the airplane. These loads have a negligible effect on the cumulative fatigue damage but affect the damage rate and crack initiation\nand propagation. Therefore, to include this effect in the program, the loads which occur\nthree times in 60 000 hours flying are applied. These loads are termed intermittent high\nloads (IHL).\nSince any cabin pressure differential higher than the normal 9.0 psi is unlikely to\noccur, no intermittent high cabin pressure is applied.\nIn previous fatigue tests it has been difficult to establish crack initiation times,\ncrack propagation rates, and crack life prior to rapid fracture in inaccessible areas, and\nfor cracks which were not found until the test was completed. To help in establishing\ncrack data, unique loads, termed marker loads (ML), are applied during the test. These\nmarker loads are arranged in sequence with the intermittent high loads so that a definite\ntest time can be determined from the striations (table 2).\n140\n\nIn the test spectrum the cabin pressure is cycled from zero to 9.0 psi to zero once\nper flight. This gives a representative cycle for a typical flight. In the training flight\nthe airplane climbs to a varying altitude three times. To represent these pressure cycles\nand concurrently provide a ML pattern for pressure-critical components, those additional\npressure cycles from the training flights are applied.\nThe present status of the major-component and full-scale airplane fatigue tests is\ngiven in table 3. The differing test goals specified in this table are an outgrowth of the\nfatigue reliability factor criteria discussed in the section entitled "Approach." In general, critical details in landing-gear structure are single-detail-type items, for example,\na fillet radius. For these types of tests, a larger statistical factor is required to achieve\ndesired reliability levels in service.\nIn built-up structure tests such as the outboard flap, horizontal stabilizer, and fullscale airplane, several points usually are identically stressed and therefore constitute a\nlarger sample and require lower statistical factors. All major components have been\nsubjected to loads exceeding the planned requirements for the basic passenger airplane.\nMany of the tests have been continued beyond the original test goals in order to substantiate derivative airplane requirements. Pending identification of requirements more\nsevere than those currently estimated, some tests have been suspended.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe Boeing 747 fatigue integrity program provides a high degree of confidence in\nthe ability of the structure to withstand service loads. Safe and economic operation is\ninsured through fail-safe design augmented with a continually updated program reflecting\npast experience, analysis, and test-demonstrated fatigue performance.\n\n141\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

Stone\nDouglas Aircraft Company\nMcDonnell Douglas Corporation\nLong Beach, California, U.S.A.\t\n\na . a_( <399\n\nSUMMARY\nThe philosophy and methods used in the design of the DC-10 aircraft to assure\nstructural reliability against cracks under repeated service loads are described in\ndetail. The approach consists of three complementary parts: (1) the structure is\ndesigned to be fatigue resistant for a crack-free life of 60 000 flight hours; (2) inasmuch as small undetected cracks could develop from other sources, such as material\nflaws and manufacturing preloads, the structure also is designed to arrest and control\ncracks within a reasonable service-inspection interval; and (3) a meaningful serviceinspection program has been defined on the basis of analysis and test experience from\nthe design development program. This service-inspection program "closes the loop"\nto assure the structural integrity of the DC-10 airframe. Selected materials, fasteners, and structural arrangements are used to achieve these design features with minimum structural weight and with economy in manufacturing and maintenance. Extensive analyses and testing were performed to develop and verify the design.\nThe basic design considerations for fatigue-resistant structure are illustrated\nin terms of material selection, design loads spectra, methods for accurate stress and\nfatigue damage analysis, and proven concepts for efficient detail design. Special\nemphasis is given to the DC-10 development test program. The initial stage of this\nprogram was a series of screening tests of candidate materials, types of fasteners,\nstress coining, surface treatments, manufacturing processes, and so forth.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe structural design goals for the DC-10, shown in figure 1, were to produce\nan airplane that is superior to the DC-8 and DC-9 and that will be operated safely and\neconomically for at least 20 years. Three complementary criteria were established\nto assure this goal:\n(1) The structure has a crack-free life of 60 000 flight hours on the basis of\ndesign, analysis, and tests in excess of 120 000 flight hours.\n\n179\n\n(2) The structure is damage tolerant. Adequate residual strength is available after\na crack has propagated, and the basic structural configuration provides for slow crack\ngrowth and arrestment before reaching critical lengths.\n(3) An inspection program has been established on the basis of a fail-safe structure\nwith adequate external detectability, as verified by component tests. In addition, the\nstart of inspection and sampling intervals were based on fatigue, corrosion, and crackpropagation resistance of the structure.\nSTRUCTURAL RELIABILITY\nA distribution is shown in figure 2 to indicate the overwhelming influence of development testing and detail design on the structural reliability of the DC-10. These two\nitems were accomplished during initial design stage; they allow true optimization of the\nDC-10 airframe by "placing the structural material where it is most effective" and\nthereby provide maximum-fatigue-life assurance. In any event, it is necessary to establish fatigue criteria, identify sensitive areas, establish fastener policies, and plan an\nearly development testing program. Without these procedures, the structural design\ncannot be successful.\nA new computer analysis system was used with a high degree of accuracy in predicting the actual working stress levels and deflections in the structural elements. Fullscale fatigue tests were used to reveal weak links and verify that proper analysis and\ndetail testing were accomplished during the aircraft design.\nFATIGUE-SENSITIVE AREAS\nOnce the fatigue-sensitive areas are recognized, proper emphasis can be given to\nthese problem areas to assure fatigue reliability. In the design of the DC-10 aircraft,\nthese areas, as shown in figures 3 and 4, were given special attention during design,\nanalysis, and testing.\nThe fatigue reliability of the wing box and fuselage pressure shell, splices, joints,\nand other discontinuities has been made equal to or better than that of the basic structural items 4, 9, and 10 of figure 3.\nANALYSIS\nEvolution of FORMAT\nIn order to assure design static and fatigue strength, actual working stresses and\ndeflections were predicted with the use of the FORTRAN Matrix Abstraction Technique\n180\n\n(FORMAT) developed by Douglas Aircraft Company over a period of 20 years (ref. 1).\nImproved computer methods and techniques, such as FORMAT, gave increased analysis\ncapability and visibility over the original DC-8 airframe, as shown in figure 5.\nThe FORMAT system is fully automatic so, even during preliminary design, structural weight is minimized and fatigue characteristics are improved by placing the material where it is most effective (ref. 2).\nDeflections\nFigure 6 shows the excellent correlation of deflections from FORMAT analysis with\ntest results. The comparison shows deflections for limit-positive-load conditions for the\nwing, fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. The test results were obtained from a successful static-load test completed on the second production aircraft in August 1970. The aircraft was fully instrumented with strain gages and deflection transducers by using a\nsophisticated 1000-channel data system.\nStress Analysis\nFigure 7 shows the stresses in the complicated root section of the wing subjected\nto limit positive-maneuver loads (from the front spar (F.S.) to the rear spar (R.S.)) and\nthe equally sensitive fuselage section above the wing subjected to limit down-bending\nloads. The circles represent static test measurements, and the solid line indicates the\nstresses computed by FORMAT analysis. The dashed lines indicate the stresses computed by elementary beam theory which underestimates the stresses at the sensitive\nstructural areas. The excellent accuracy of the detail stress analysis allows the calculation of reliable local stress levels and assures the fatigue quality of the DC-10 structure.\nWorking Stresses\nThe working stress levels for the DC-10 wing have been carefully established on\nthe basis of the working stresses used on earlier airplanes which, since, have had proven\nlongevity (fig. 8). The working stress levels for the fuselage shell have increased mainly\nbecause of the wide-body cross section. This increase in stress has been accomplished\nwith no loss in fatigue strength through improvement in detail design.\nFatigue Quality Structure\nThe increase in working stress levels and the additional requirement for dependable\nlong-life aircraft make it mandatory to increase the fatigue quality of all structural elements. The results of several thousand constant-amplitude component fatigue tests of\nstructural elements of various configurations are summarized in figure 9. (R is the\n181\n\nmaximum stress in any cycle divided by the minimum stress in the cycle.) It is noteworthy that the basic structure has considerable longevity as attested by the DC-3, DC-6,\nDC-7, and DC-8 airframe structure. As shown, the DC-6 and DC-7 joints were critical;\nthe DC-8 joints were practically equivalent to the basic structure, and the DC-10 joints\nare equal to or better than the basic structure. The DC-10 structure incorporated the\nbest structural details gained from knowledge of DC-8 structure and DC-10 development\ntesting.\nDEVELOPMENT TESTS\nThe results of over 2000 fatigue development tests conducted on the DC-8 and DC-9\nhave been used in conjunction with an additional 1700 fatigue development DC-10 tests to\nsubstantiate crack-free, long-life structures. The fatigue development test program has\nbeen completed in time to permit the designer to incorporate the test findings into the\ndesign. The DC-10 program was planned to utilize small inexpensive specimens as well\nas large aircraft components.\nSpecimen Development Testing\nDouble bow-tie wing specimens have been used to obtain reliable fatigue data in\nminimum time and at minimum expense. Results from specimens of this type have been\nfound to correlate closely with results from more complex and expensive specimens composed of skin and stringers. These tests permit rapid evaluation of various attachment\ntypes, hole sizes, hole-preparation methods, material-thickness effects, claddings, and\nso forth, on the fatigue life of the basic structure. Bow-tie wing specimens cannot be used\nfor all configurations; therefore, more typical simple wing slices were also used to evaluate fasteners. Over 300 specimens of these types were tested. The test results are\nshown in figure 10.\nThe simple longitudinal and transverse skin splices and the longeron-to -frame connection fuselage fatigue development tests were separately conducted to evaluate and\nscreen materials, fastener selection, surface treatment, and so forth. The results of the\nlongitudinal and transverse tests are shown in figure 10.\nComponent Development Testing\nStructural-wing-component fatigue development tests were conducted on actual parts\nthat are used in the final aircraft design. All the knowledge gained through the bow-tie\nand other specimen testing was incorporated in the structural components. Approximately\n140 tests were conducted. These aircraft components (fig. 3) were tested and improved\nuntil at least 150 000 to 350 000 flight hours were attained. The results are shown in\n182\n\nfigure 11 for constant-amplitude tests. After the final configurations were selected,\nflight-by-flight spectrum tests were conducted on major components to verify the minimum of 150 000 flight hours.\nSix curved stiffened 168- by 104-inch panels, representing various areas of the\nfuselage, were tested under combined biaxial loads, pressure, and inertia loads. The\ndesign features gained on the previously described specimen development tests were\nincorporated into the design of these panels. The panels consisted of eight frames,\n11 longerons, four-way splice (longitudinal and transverse) basic structure, and longeronto-frame connections. Fatigue tests were performed on the curved panels. Both pressure and axial loads were cycled at constant load levels to simulate stresses higher than\nthose which would produce fatigue damage equivalent to the full spectrum of loads experienced by the aircraft in flight (fig. 11). Additional fatigue tests were conducted on\nwindow-belt panels and pressure-bulkhead panels.\nThese specimens were tested in 1.5-million-pound fatigue test machines at the laboratory test facility. Four of these machines could each hold and test two specimens\nsimultaneously. In this way, the tests were finished quickly so that the findings could be\nincorporated into the drawings early in the design.\nDETAIL DESIGN\nThe basic design considerations for fatigue-resistant structure have been established for the DC-10 by paying strict attention to proven detail design concepts. Before\nfabrication, wooden models of all important structural fittings were made to review for\nnotch concentrations and unexpected machine mismatch areas. Photo stress tests were\nalso conducted on main fittings to determine the stress distributions and peak stress\nmagnitudes in areas where stresses are difficult to predict. On the basis of DC-8 and\nDC-9 experience, coupled with the extensive DC-10 development test program, many\nfatigue design features were established, as shown in figures 12, 13, and 14.\nThe fatigue life of the DC-10 inboard sweep break skin-stringer joint (fig. 12)\nbecame greater than that of the adjoining basic structure after the components were properly tapered and material was added locally at the discontinuities. Interference-fit\nattachments were also used to increase fatigue life.\nTo attain maximum fatigue-resistant structure of basic leading-edge skin to sparcap structure, a sacrificial doubler has been used to attach the interchangeable leadingedge section to the front-spar (F.S.) cap as shown in figure 13. This design allows the\nuse of interference attachments in the heavier spar-cap flanges.\nFigure 14 shows the fuselage detail design features. The use of properly stepped\ndoublers around the fuselage door corners reduces stress concentrations. Adding a local\n183\n\nchannel pad to the longeron reduces local bending between the longeron and frame connection. The scalloped longeron splice fitting and fingered doublers assure uniform load\ntransfer and reduce the first attachment load.\nQUALIFICATION TESTING\nThe DC-10 is undergoing a flight-by-flight production-airplane fatigue test to\n120 000 flight hours and 84 000 flights. The fourth production airplane is divided into\nthree major sections, as shown in figure 15. The shaded test structures shown at the\nends of each section represent steel drums that are a minimum of one fuselage diameter\nin length to assure that load is properly introduced into the aircraft structure. Special\ndesign aluminum transition sections modulate interaction effects between the steel drums\nand aircraft structure to preclude fatigue failures in that region. The division into three\nsections was based on the following factors:\n(1) There are fewer compromises in the load spectrum.\n(2) Noncritical loads can be eliminated and other critical loads added for each undivided section.\n(3) Sections can continue cycling while one section is down for inspection or repair.\nThe cycles are being applied to each individual section as shown in the following\ntable:\nNumber of cycles applied to \xe2\x80\x94\nType of load\n\nForward Wing-fuselage\nsection\nsection\n\nAft\nsection\n\nGround loads\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nFlight loads\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nLanding impact .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nGround-Air -Ground (G-A-G) * . . . . .\nFuselage pressurizations\t .\t . . .\t .\t .\t .\n\n252 000\n383 040\n37 800\n84 000\n84 000\n\n389 840\n913 332\n36 540\n84 000\n84 000\n\n168 000\n753 648\n37 800\n84 000\n84 000\n\nTotal:\n\n840 840\n\n1 507 712\n\n1 127 448\n\n*Inherently obtained because the load spectrum is applied on a flight-byflight basis.\nTesting experience has shown that proper loads can be applied more accurately to\nsmaller components subjected to large concentrated loads. The main and nose landing\ngears and adjacent support structure, therefore, are tested separately so that every\ndetailed area is subjected to the millions of cycles that occur in service (ref. 3).\n184\n\nDAMAGE-TOLERANT STRUCTURE\nThe DC-10 primary structure is designed to be fail-safe, with the exception of the\nlanding gear for which fail-safe design is not practical. The fail-safe criterion used in\nthe DC-10 is more stringent than specification requirements; that is, the structure must\nsupport the fail-safe load soon after several components have failed.\nIdentification of Sensitive Areas (Fuselage)\nThe radial loading due to cabin internal pressure can start a longitudinal skin crack\nin two locations:\n(1) At the skin line where the fingered doubler is attached to the skin of the longitudinal skin splice, shown in figure 16(a) (This type of fatigue crack results in a\none-bay longitudinal skin crack.)\n(2) At the first attachment of shear clip frame to skin, shown in figure 16(b) (The\nfatigue crack of this type can propagate into a two-bay longitudinal crack.)\nThe combined pressure and axial loads can start a transverse skin crack where the\nlongeron is attached to the frame. After failure of the longeron a skin crack can form\nwhich may propagate into two adjacent skin bays, shown in figure 16(c). Recognition of\nthese facts led to the following damage-tolerant conditions selected for the fuselage shell\nstructure shown in figure 16(d):\n(1) Two-bay longitudinal crack with center crack stoppers failed\n(2) Two-bay transverse crack with center longeron failed\nThe design selected contains titanium crack stoppers at each frame capable of arresting\na two-bay longitudinal crack. The hat section longerons act as natural transverse crack\nstoppers.\nStress Analysis (Fuselage Panels)\nThe equation for the fracture strength of stiffened thin panels containing a crack is\nKcRct\n\nQ\t\n\nR\n\nVW tan (&)\n\nwhere\nQR\t\n\ngross residual stress, psi\n\nKc\t\n\nplane stress fracture toughness, psi in.\n185\n\nRct\n\nCrack-tip stress of unstiffened panel\nCrack-tip stress of stiffened panel\n\nW\t\n\npanel width, inches\n\na\t\n\nhalf crack length, inches\n\nas\tstiffener stress, psi\na\t\n\ngross applied stress, psi\n\nToughness Kc is determined from tests on stiffened panels as shown in figure 17(a).\nThe ratio Rct is determined from analysis of unstiffened and stiffened panels having the\nsame grid size by taking a ratio between the crack-tip stresses (ref. 4). The idealized\nstructure and analysis are based on the FORTRAN Matrix Abstraction Technique\n(FORMAT) shown in figure 17(b).\nSkin Fracture Criterion (Fuselage Panels)\nResults of fuselage panel residual strength tests are shown that verify test and\ntheory correlation. The shape of the curve is determined by analysis and the height by\ncritical fracture toughness Kc . (Note the point of fast fracture.) The curve plotted in\nfigure 17(c) shows correlation with the analysis at critical crack length, crack arrest,\nand final failure.\nThe maximum allowable principal stress for a two-bay longitudinal crack is above\nthe maximum operating principal stress for the DC-10 and provides an adequate margin\nof safety.\nStiffener Criteria (Fuselage Panels)\nStiffener strength must be adequate. In order to maintain the skin fracture strength,\nthe stiffener must not fail. An example of frame (aluminum) stress and outer-crackstopper (titanium) stress correlation is shown in figure 17(d).\nFail-Safe Testing (Fuselage Panels)\nExtensive fail-safe testing has been completed. A comprehensive test program was\ninitiated early in the DC-10 design to verify analytical methods and to evaluate various\nstiffener configurations and materials. Figure 18 illustrates some of the fail-safe development test specimens. Finally, six 118.5-inch-radius curved panels were tested to\ndetermine the residual strength. These tests showed that the fuselage shell structure\n186\n\nprovides more than adequate fail-safe capability for the conservative two-bay selected\ndamage-tolerance criteria.\nStress Analysis and Testing (Wing Panels)\nAn important design consideration of the DC-10 wing structure is to sustain an initial failure of a member but allow for extension of the failure over a reasonable number\nof additional flight hours. This approach assures that an initial crack will not grow to\ncritical proportion before it is detected during routine inspection intervals.\nThe damage-tolerance criterion, a two-bay crack with center stringer failed, has\nbeen incorporated into the design of the DC-10 wing box structure shown in figure 19. In\naddition, four separate skin panels are used on the wing lower surface to arrest further\nany crack propagation.\nFigure 20 shows FORMAT analysis correlation with experimental results obtained\nfrom tests of large skin-stringer panels representing typical wing box construction.\nStresses at adjacent stringers have been calculated as functions of crack length. The\nresults have been verified by strain-gage test results.\nSTRUCTURAL INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM\nThe purpose of the structural inspection and maintenance program is to detect\nstructural problems on aircraft before airworthiness is affected or expensive repairs\nbecome necessary. The importance of the structural inspection and maintenance program\nwas recognized during initial DC-10 design stages. Goals were established to provide\nrequired structural airworthiness levels at minimum inspection and maintenance costs.\nThe main approach is to give full assurance that the aircraft structure will be relatively crack free for its intended service life of 60 000 flight hours and 42 000 flights.\nThis high degree of structural reliability was achieved by designing, analyzing, and testing\nto (1) a fatigue life in excess of 120 000 flight hours and 84 000 flights to crack initiation\nand (2) a fail-safe life based on a two-bay crack length requirement.\nFatigue Life\nItem (1) \xe2\x80\x94 that is, a fatigue life in excess of 120 000 flight hours and 84 000 flights\nto crack initiation \xe2\x80\x94 incorporates various design features.\nWorking stress levels. - Accurate stress levels were predicted for structural sizing\nusing FORMAT analysis. Stress levels are equivalent to those of the DC-8 and DC-9,\nwhich have excellent service experience.\n\n187\n\nDetail design. - Stress concentrations were minimized in joints, splices, and basic\nstructure by the use of proper tapering and scalloping, stress coining, and interferencefit attachments (ref. 5). Preload stresses were minimized by providing flexible structure\nin design, shop fabrication assembly, and installation tolerance control. Detail design\nquality of the structure is equivalent to, or better than, DC-8 and DC-9 quality, as verified\nthrough component fatigue test results.\nCorrosion and stress corrosion. - Corrosion was prevented through faying-surface\nsealing, priming, top coating epoxy paints, draining, using clad aluminum materials, and\nusing high-strength fasteners installed wet with sealant or primer. Stress corrosion\nresistance was maximized by utilizing 7075-T73 material, which has a high corrosion\nthreshold.\nFail-Safe Life\nItem (2) \xe2\x80\x94 a fail-safe life based on a two-bay crack length requirement \xe2\x80\x94 involves\ntwo main design considerations. The use of FORMAT analysis, verified by large panel\ncomponent tests, enabled the structure to be designed for slow crack growth and crack\narrestment.\nCrack growth. - Slow crack growth is attained through the selection of 2024 aluminum with its high fracture toughness properties (low notch sensitivity) and by the use of\nlow working stress levels (ref. 6).\nCrack arrestment. - Cracks are arrested by the use of titanium straps at fuselage\nframes, additional spanwise splices, separately attached but closely spaced wing stringers,\nand stiffeners attached to the fuselage shell and bulkheads.\nSignificant Structural Items\nBecause of the high probability of a long fatigue life, the inspection program will\nbe started rather late in the service life. Also, because the structure is fail-safe, the\ninspections can be spaced somewhat farther apart than those on older types of aircraft\n(ref. 7).\nThe selection of the significant structural items to be inspected is based on the\nknowledge and experience with past programs and the manufacturer\'s assessment of the\nmost fatigue- and corrosion-sensitive structure. It is necessary, therefore, to define\nthe following two steps:\n(1) External structural members are designed to crack before complex or hidden\njoints, doublers, frames, and so forth. This "controlled failure" approach was developed\nand confirmed by many component tests. For example, over 300 fuselage skin splice\nspecimens were tested to assure skin external crack failures (fig. 21).\n188\n\n(2) Internal members, if cracked, are designed to eventually propagate the crack\nthrough to the external members so that the crack becomes externally detectable. The\nslow crack growth provides sufficient time to inspect and detect cracks before failure,\nand crack arrestment and the two-bay-crack residual strength of the design provide adequate fail-safe strength.\nInitial Inspection and Intervals\nThe inspection plan has been designed to detect crack initiation, early signs of corrosion, and manufacturing variabilities (preload). The statistical approach was used to\nobtain a feel for the effect of fatigue variability (ref. 8) and fracture roughness characteristics. The variabilities required the use of knowledge gained from the DC-8 and DC-9\nsuccessful service experience.\nThe plan of inspection for structural fatigue critical items is listed below:\n(1) External items receive 100-percent inspection at periodic intervals.\n(2) Internal items, with external detectability, receive 100-percent inspection externally at periodic intervals.\n(3) Major load-carrying internal items, without external detectability, are inspected\nas frequently as the external items.\n(4) Other load-carrying internal items, without external detectability, receive only\nsampling inspection.\nThe inspection and maintenance program for the DC-10 is designed to assure maximum vehicle airworthiness at minimum cost.\nCONCLUSIONS\nTo date, both the DC-8 and DC-9 fleets have been flown with only a few isolated\nfatigue failures in the primary structure; this fact is significant because high-time DC-81s\nhave accumulated about 48 000 flight hours and 28 000 landings, and DC-9\'s have recorded\n32 000 landings.\nThe DC-10 is a third-generation jetliner and, therefore, is expected to be superior\nto its predecessors because of the following factors:\n(1) Crack-free life of 60 000 flight hours\n(2) Slow crack growth and arrestment\n(3) External detectability in main load-carrying structure\n(4) Completed development testing during initial design\n189\n\n(5) Detail design and fatigue procedures based on past experience\n(6) Working stress levels and deflections based on accurate design\n(7) Fatigue critical areas recognized in planning stage\n(8) Full-scale tests reveal weak links and check performance.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

D. J. Maxwell\nRoyal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, Hampshire,\nUnited Kingdom\nSUMMARY\nThe paper describes the methods adopted in the United Kingdom to ensure the\nstructural integrity of military aeroplanes and helicopters from the fatigue point of\nview. It describes the procedure adopted from the writing of the specification to the\nmonitoring of fatigue life in service, and outlines the requirements to be met and the\nway in which they are satisfied. It also indicates some of the outstanding problems\nthat remain to be solved.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe formal airworthiness requirements for the design of military aircraft and\nhelicopter structures against fatigue are contained in the Ministry of Aviation Supply\'s\npublication AvP 970. This document lists a number of mandatory requirements\ntogether with advisory leaflets as to how these requirements may be satisfied. Although\nthe mandatory parts, which are written in fairly general terms, are still valid, the\nadvisory leaflets, written mainly in 1958-1959, are now a little out of date and do not\nalways agree with current practice. The object of this paper is to describe the existing\nprocess of ensuring an acceptable fatigue performance including both the satisfaction of\nthe mandatory requirements and the subsequent monitoring of that performance in\nservice.\nHowever, before starting the main part of the paper it is worth indicating how the\nStructures Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which is part of the\nMinistry of Aviation Supply, is involved in the various phases of an aircraft\'s development and operational use. Its activities can be summarized as follows:\n(a) Making critical comments on the initial specification from the Ministry of\nDefence, who is the customer, and the early brochures from the manufacturers. These\ncomments are made through the Project team in the Ministry of Aviation Supply, which\nis the procurement authority.\n(b) Interpreting the aircraft usage in terms of load spectra by discussions with the\nMinistry of Defence and the manufacturers.\n213\n\n(c) Agreeing with the manufacturers, as required by AvP 970, on the extent of\nfatigue testing to be done.\n(d) Agreeing with the manufacturers after completion of fatigue testing on the service life to be promulgated to the Ministry of Defence through the Project team.\n(e) Acting as technical adviser to the Project team in discussions on fatigue arising\nin service.\nIt is clear therefore that Structures Department has a hand in every phase of the aircraft\'s life.\nTHE GENERAL PROBLEM\nThroughout the sequence of operations, the general fatigue problem will be considered under three basic headings:\n(a) The determination of the loads/stress spectra experienced by various parts of\nthe structure\n(b) The determination of the fatigue performance of various parts of the structure\n(c) The estimation and monitoring of the service life\nIn general, the procedure will be considered in two phases:\n(a) The design-development phase, that is, up to the aircraft\'s entrance into\nservice\n(b) The production and service phase\nFirstly, fixed-wing aircraft designed on safe-life principles will be considered; secondly,\nfixed-wing aircraft that are essentially fail-safe; thirdly, helicopters which are invariably designed safe-life; and lastly, fail-safe helicopters.\nWRITING THE AIRCRAFT SPECIFICATION\nWhen the fatigue life specification is written, two important aspects need to be\ncovered. Firstly, the role or combination of roles for which the specified life is required\nmust be described in sufficient detail to enable load spectrum estimates to be made.\nThis description is extremely important, as contractual compliance with the fatigue life\nrequirements will be determined by tests under these load spectra. Thus, the requirement should indicate\n(a) The types of role in which the aircraft will be operated (that is, route flying,\nground-attack, marine reconnaissance, etc.) and the proportion of time\nspent in each role\n214\n\n(b) Flight profiles anticipated (heights, speeds)\n(c) Operating weights and stores to be carried\n(d) Numbers of landings\n(e) Numbers of pressurizations\nSecondly, it must be made clear whether the required life is the minimum to be\nachieved in the stated mixture of roles or whether it is the average life to be achieved.\nThis definition of the life determines whether the life is to be achieved under the most\nsevere spectrum or under an average spectrum, estimated from the stated usage.\nDETERMINATION OF LOAD SPECTRA\nAt the beginning of the design-development phase, the load spectra for the aircraft\nare estimated for the specified utilisation. The estimates are obtained mainly from\ndata collected from previous aircraft. Toward the end of this phase, the estimates may\nbe modified by loads measured on prototype aircraft. The loads to be considered\ninclude those discussed in the following paragraphs.\nGust Loads\nThe gust loads are estimated from the flight profiles quoted in the aircraft specification by using mainly discrete gust data with rigid-body response giving centre-ofgravity accelerations. For larger aircraft some allowance is made for flexibility. The\nuse of power spectral methods to estimate gust loads in terms of centre-of-gravity\naccelerations is under consideration. The same discrete gust data are used to estimate\ntailplane and fin loads. Fin load frequencies are arbitrarily multiplied by 3 to allow for\nDutch roll type of response and to allow for some manoeuvre content.\nManoeuvre Loads\nManoeuvre loads again are obtained in the form of centre-of-gravity accelerations.\nThey are compiled mainly from the load spectra collected from fatigue (load) meters\n(counting accelerometers) on previous aircraft flying similar roles with some allowance\nwhere necessary for different design limit values of centre-of-gravity acceleration. If\nnew types of role are envisaged, manoeuvre loads must be estimated by consultation\nwith the operators. Manoeuvre loads are mainly of significance for the wing and fuselage but may also be important for the tailplane. Attempts have been made on some\naircraft to calculate the tailplane loads required to initiate the centre-of-gravity accelerations of the manoeuvre spectra. In general, such calculations suggest that peak loads\nof about twice the magnitude of the tail balancing loads for the manoeuvre under consideration are obtained.\n215\n\nGround-Air Cycle\nUntil recently this ground-air cycle, a once per flight cycle, which is mainly of\nimportance for the wings has been considered to range from a lower limit given by the\ndown load generated by a 1.2g acceleration while taxying under maximum take-off load\nto an upper limit occurring in the Ig level flight condition. It is now considered that a\nmore realistic allowance for the ground-air cycle is obtained for transport and heavy\nbomber aircraft if the upper limit of the cycle is taken as the Ig condition plus the positive load occurring once per flight. In addition, it recognised that the once per flight\ndown load for this class of aircraft is likely to be between 1.3g and 1.4g rather than 1.2g.\nThe ground-air cycle is normally considered to be unimportant for fighter-attack aircraft where negative manoeuvres in flight give greater down loads than those experienced\non the ground.\nGround Loads\nEstimates of ground loads are, of course, of primary importance for the fatiguelife assessment of the undercarriage, but the loads transmitted to the rest of the structure can also be important for the top surfaces of wings and fuselages of large aircraft.\nMany modern transports and heavy bombers have undercarriages on or near the fuselage.\nConsequently, the top surfaces of the large-span, fuel-filled wings are in tension on the\nground. The alternating stresses generated by ground loads can therefore cause fatigue\nproblems in the top wing surfaces. Similarly, bending loads in the long fuselages can\nproduce fatigue-prone regions. In general, little data analogous to the gust and\nmanoeuvre data exist. At present, methods of measurement and analysis of such loads\non development aircraft are difficult and no operational recorders are available.\nAlthough power spectral methods of analysis are giving some indication of the vertical\nloads likely to be experienced, little has been done to calculate side loads, which may be\nextremely important for the undercarriage.\nLocal and Acoustic Loads\nLocal loads include such loads as those due to flap and airbrake operations. Estimates of sound pressure levels for acoustic loads can be made once the engine type and\nconfiguration are known.\nCONVERSION OF LOAD SPECTRA TO STRESS SPECTRA\nThe structure is examined in detail and at all stations considered to contain possible\nfatigue problems, the local stresses corresponding to the various parts of the load spectrum are calculated. In general, rigid body conditions are used, but some allowance for\n216\n\ndynamic effects is made if it is thought that the stress levels will be significantly\naffected. In the later stages of the design-development phase, the stress calculations\nare supplemented by flight measurements on prototype aircraft. The importance of\nknowing the utilisation pattern in some detail again becomes apparent since the centreof-gravity accelerations of the load spectrum must be associated with the correct weight\nand flight conditions to obtain the corresponding stresses. Hence, an estimate must be\nmade of where in the flight the accelerations are most likely to occur.\nASSESSMENT OF FATIGUE PERFORMANCE\nThe initial assessment of fatigue performance is by a calculation using Miner\'s\nhypothesis to evaluate the lives of those components for which the stress spectra have\nbeen determined together with S-N curves appropriate to the type of component and\nmaterial considered. In general, manufacturers use their own S-N data based on tests\non previous aircraft with components similar to those proposed for the new model.\nWhere such curves are not available, either the basic material curves are used with\nsome allowance for stress concentrations and other effects or some typical curve such\nas those in the Royal Aeronautical Society/Engineering Sciences Data Unit Data Sheets.\nIn particular, the Heywood joint curve A, Data Sheet E.05.01 is regarded as a good\nstarting point for calculations on aluminium alloy structures. Parts shown by the initial\ncalculations to have marginally acceptable lives are tested under realistic load sequences\nof the required stress spectrum.\nASSIGNMENT OF PROVISIONAL SERVICE LIFE\nAt this stage, the end of the design-development phase, there will be a number of\nprototype aircraft flying and production will be about to start. In order to provide some\nsafeguard for early flying until the major fatigue test is completed, provisional fatigue\nlives are assessed on the basis of the calculations and test results available at this time.\nThe life of the aircraft as a whole will be determined by the life of the most critical\nirreplaceable component. Within that life, other components may need replacing. In all\ncases lives will be calculated by using the average spectrum for the sortie, or mixture\nof sorties, required and either the standard S-N curves or the later component tests.\nThese lives will then be the lives one would expect for average components, and must be\ndivided by the following factors:\n(1) By 2 to account for inaccuracies in calculation and component tests compared\nwith full-scale (major) tests. This factor is based on a paper presented by Raithby to\nthe I.C.A.F. in 1961 (ref. 1) which showed that lives based on component tests and calculations usually overestimated the lives subsequently achieved on the full-scale test.\n217\n\n(2) By a factor varying from 3 3 to 5 depending upon the number of specimens\ntested. This factor is essentially to allow for scatter. In this context, since the standard\nS-N curves are usually based on a large number of results a scatter factor of 33 is used.\nThe greater uncertainty compared with results based on the component tests is usually\nallowed for by using what are thought to be conservative S-N data.\n(3) By a factor of 1.5 to allow for variations in load spectrum from aircraft to aircraft flying the same role, when it is assumed that the calculated life is based on an\naverage spectrum. This factor is not required if the provisional life is to be monitored\nfor individual aircraft by the fatigue meter or some other method of recording individual\nvariations of load spectrum. If it is decided to use the fatigue meter to monitor the provisional life, a formula will be derived as described subsequently, but unless the major\nfatigue test is likely to be delayed or the particular aircraft are going to fly consistently\nin a severe role, it is normal to wait for the results of the major fatigue test before\ndeveloping the fatigue meter formula.\nTHE MAJOR OR FULL-SCALE TEST\nIt is now recognised that lives based on calculations or component tests are likely\nto be inaccurate. This condition exists partly because the loads on the particular components considered are difficult to assess accurately owing to the complex nature of the\nstructure and partly because of the difficulty of pred\'cting which are in fact the critical\ncomponents. It has therefore become a matter of policy to carry out tests either on the\ncomplete structure or on the major components (complete wing, fuselage, fin, etc.). In\nthe latter case, all parts of the structure must be covered.\nThe test specimen is normally an early production airframe to ensure that detail\ndesign and manufacturing standards are comparable with those of service aircraft. The\nload spectrum is again derived from the utilisation pattern in the specification. However,\nby this time some flight load measurements should have taken place on prototype aircraft\nso that more knowledge should be available, for example, on the dynamic response of the\naircraft, and should lead to more realistic relationships between local stresses and\ncentre-of-gravity accelerations.\nUsually the loads are applied in realistic sequences by using many load levels.\nFor transports and heavy hombers this procedure results in flight-by-flight loading so\nthat ground-air cycles are interspersed with flight loads and in most cases, a ground\nload spectrum also is applied. In addition, on some of these aircraft, the manoeuvres\nand gust loads have been applied in a random order between the ground-air cycles.\nThese realistic sequences are intended to ensure that the changing residual stress\n218\n\npatterns around the stress concentrations which are known to affect fatigue life, but\nwhich at this time are not taken into account in theoretical assessments, are reasonably\naccounted for on test. The random load sequence of gusts has another advantage over the\nmore common block programme in that it is easier to use a large number of load levels\nbecause there is no fixed pattern for each flight and hence no need to choose intervals\nof load that result in finite numbers of each level per flight. This procedure enables a\nbetter representation of a continuous stress spectrum to be made than can be achieved\nwith the usual block programme. The flight-by-flight representation is not always used\non fighter-attack aircraft if the negative flight manoeuvres impose bigger down loads\nthan those on the ground.\nThe test is normally carried on to the "factored" required life unless prior catastrophic failure occurs. If no such failure has taken place, a review is made and frequently the test is continued for another factored life or to failure to allow for any\nextension of life in service beyond that anticipated at the design stage.\nINTERPRETATION OF MAJOR FATIGUE TEST\nThe failure or failures that have occurred under the known loading on test have to\nbe related to the load spectra experienced in the various roles in service and safety\nfactors applied to allow for scatter. For each failure, the following procedure is adopted:\n(1) The S-N curve used to estimate the life of the failed item in the designdevelopment phase is adjusted by factoring the stress scale until the calculation using the\nstress spectrum applied on the test gives the test life to failure.\n(2) This adjusted S-N curve is then used to calculate the lives to be expected in the\nvarious service roles, using Miner\'s hypothesis and the anticipated spectra. The same\ncurve is used to derive the coefficients of the fatigue meter formulae which are obtained\nby the method described by Phillips. (See ref. 2.) The use of these formulae is\ndescribed subsequently.\n(3) The lives for each role and the coefficients of the fatigue meter formulae are\nthen divided by the factor to allow for scatter in performance. In general, only one\nspecimen will have been tested so that according to the recommended factors in\nAvP 970 a value of 5 should be used, but in practice, a factor of 3 3 has been used for all\nlives based on major tests. Although this procedure is difficult to justify theoretically,\nit was considered reasonable in view of the greater certainty obtained from this type of\ntest. As there has been no regular shortfall in achieved service life that could be\nattributed to this cause, the practice has been allowed to stand. It should nevertheless\nbe recognised that it is extremely difficult to obtain feedback of service data on which to\nbase a reliable correlation analysis.\n219\n\n(4) The lives for each role are divided by a further factor of 1.5 to allow for variations of load spectrum experienced by individual aircraft flying the same role. This\nfactor is not applied to the fatigue meter coefficients as the meter registers the individual variations.\nIt should be emphasized that the utilisation pattern originally laid down should\nrepresent as nearly as possible the anticipated usage in service because the fatigue test\nis based on this pattern and although estimates can be made for other patterns, as shown\nabove, the accuracy of prediction is likely to fall when the new patterns deviate markedly\nfrom that used on test.\nFAIL-SAFE STRUCTURES\nThe procedure described is aimed primarily at preserving the safety of safe-life\ntype structures which can fail without prior warning. A similar procedure is also necessary for fail-safe structures, which are defined as those in which fatigue cracks or\ncomponent failures can be found before the strength falls to an unacceptable level. As\nthe whole concept of fail-safe stands or falls by the ability to detect cracks early, the\nimportance of ensuring that all cracks can be found cannot be overstressed. Hence, it\nis essential to obtain as much information as possible from the full-scale test on the\nprobable location of cracks. Thus, the full-scale test is as important for fail-safe\nstructures as for the safe-life type although the emphasis is different.\nThe test should first demonstrate that the structure really is fail-safe, that is,\nthat at no time during the service life is there likely to be an undetectable major failure.\nThe main dangers are design errors leading to an early unexpected catastrophic failure\nor the accumulation of many small failures late in the life which are insignificant and\ndifficult to detect individually but which may suddenly join to give a catastrophic failure.\nThe long riveted joints of pressure cabins are particularly vulnerable to this latter type\nof failure as the skin experiences similar stress cycles at all rivet locations. Hence,\nsmall cracks, which will almost certainly escape detection, are likely to form at about\nthe same time along the rivet line, and these may suddenly join into one long, possibly\ncatastrophic crack.\nThe second purpose of the test is to show which are the likely areas of cracking,\nwhen the cracks are likely to occur and how fast they will propagate. This information\nwill enable inspections to be started early enough and to take place frequently enough to\nensure safety. In addition, the actual inspection techniques can be developed on the\ncomplete built-up structure.\nIn order to show that no catastrophic failures will occur during the required life,\na fail-safe structure is required to be tested to the same factors on life as a safe-life\n220\n\nstructure. In order to demonstrate that cracks are fail-safe, a crack must be allowed\nto propagate on test for three inspection periods after it has reached the shortest length\nthat can be found with certainty under the inspection method to be used. At the end of\nthat time it must sustain 80 percent of the ultimate load.\nThe demonstration of the residual strength characteristics poses a practical problem. The 80 percent ultimate load cannot be applied at the end of the crack propagation\nphase if the test has not reached the factored required life because if it does not survive\nthe application of the load, the specimen is lost or severely damaged and if it does survive, the rest of the test will be invalidated because of the unrepresentative residual\nstress pattern generated by this exceptionally high load. The usual technique is to run\nthe crack for three inspection periods or until the crack is considered long enough just\nto sustain the test load. (In this case a shorter inspection period will be imposed in\nservice.) The crack is then repaired with a patch and the test continued. At the conclusion of the test the patches are removed one at a time and the 80 percent ultimate load\napplied. This is clearly not entirely satisfactory but no completely satisfactory solution has been found. In some cases it may be possible to simulate the relevant cracks\non the static test specimen if this is still available and apply the test load to that, but\ncare must be exercised to ensure a crack tip that is typical of fatigue.\nThese requirements ensure safety but it is also necessary to ensure a reasonably\neconomic aircraft. It is therefore a requirement that the first crack shall not appear on\nthe weakest aircraft from a fatigue point of view before half the specified life has been\nachieved and that the amount of repair work shall not become uneconomic on the weakest\naircraft before the whole specified life is achieved.\nHence it can be seen that the test requirements are similar for both fail-safe and\nsafe-life aircraft. Therefore, although the designer is encouraged to design fail-safe\n(if he believes his design to be fail-safe he is at liberty to use lower factors in the design\nto allow for scatter than he would for safe-life design), the structure is judged on its\nperformance in the test, such failures that occur being judged on their merits. Failures\nwhich can be considered fail-safe will require inspection in service starting at the factored life, followed by repair or replacement only if they occur, whereas safe-life failures require either modification of the failed item or retirement of the whole structure\nat the factored life.\nMONITORING IN SERVICE\nThe object of monitoring in service is to relate the load spectra experienced by\nindividual aircraft to the failures that occur on the fatigue test. In order to assess the\nservice load spectra, each aircraft is equipped with a fatigue (load) meter, which is a\n221\n\ncounting accelerometer recording the number of times each of eight levels of centre-ofgravity acceleration is exceeded. The actual levels recorded depend upon the type of\naircraft, there being a number of standard instruments, but usually there are five levels\nabove Ig and three below. These instruments are read after every flight and the counts\nrecorded together with information on the type of sortie, take-off and landing weight,\nstores carried, number of pressurizations and any other details considered relevant to\nthe consumption of fatigue life.\nThere are then three main methods of using this information: the fatigue meter\nformula, role lives, and total number of occurrences of a particular event, each of which\ntells the operator to initiate some action. Each method relates a failure under the known\ntest loading to the loads experienced in service with the appropriate factors. If the failure on test is safe-life, reaching the factored life means either that the item must be\nreplaced or that the complete structure must be retired. If the failure is fail-safe,\nreaching the factored life means that inspection must start. These inspections continue\nat a frequency determined by the same methods; that is, the individual load spectra are\nrelated to the test loadings during the crack-propagation phase so that inspection periods\nmay fluctuate in time depending upon usage. In practice, inspections are called for either\nat fixed time intervals to coincide with normal scheduled maintenance or when the monitoring system indicates an inspection to be due; it is usually possible to ensure that most\ninspections occur at scheduled maintenance periods.\nOf the three methods of assessing the fatigue life, the fatigue meter formula is\nconsidered to be the most accurate and is used when the stress levels at the monitored\nstations can be related to centre-of-gravity accelerations. This usage usually covers\nwing stations and fuselage stations affected by longitudinal bending. The operator is\nsupplied with a formula consisting of coefficients by which to multiply the counts\nrecorded on each flight at each level of g, together with overall factors depending upon\ntype of sortie, take-off and landing weight, stores carried, etc. He thus calculates flight\nby flight a steadily increasing number which is a measure of fatigue damage. When the\nnumber reaches a certain value, he initiates the appropriate action, either retirement or\nstart of inspection. In the early days of fatigue meter formulae, one simple set of coefficients was used to monitor the one safe-life failure that determined the ultimate life\nof the structure. Today, with fail-safe structures it may be necessary to monitor a\nseries of possible failures, inspections for which will start at different times. In addition, with the large variety and weight of stores that can be carried, it has become necessary to allow for relatively large variations in the relationship between stress at the\nstation to be monitored and the centre-of-gravity acceleration recorded. Hence it is\nsometimes necessary to have a series of formulae and correction factors for one aircraft.\n\n222\n\nThe second method of monitoring, role lives, is used to cover periods of flying in\nwhich the fatigue meter is unserviceable or to monitor parts for which the fatigue meter\ncounts have no relevance but for which it is known that the load spectrum varies with the\ntype of sortie, or role flown. In this method, the load spectra are first estimated for\neach type of flight (in the case of flying with an unserviceable meter these are obtained\nby analysis of other aircraft records on similar sorties). The factored lives are then\ncalculated by using Miner\'s hypothesis and the adjusted S-N curve derived from the test.\nIt should be noted that if average load spectra are used, the factor of 1.5 for variation\nwithin the same sortie must be included. Each hour\'s flying is then divided by the\nfactored life in the role to give the fraction of damage done. When these fractions add\nup to 1, the appropriate action is taken. When used to cover periods of meter unserviceability, the operator is given a coefficient based on this fraction by which to multiply the\nnumber of hours flown in each role and this number can be added to the number obtained\nfrom the fatigue meter formulae.\nThe third method of monitoring is the simplest and can be used when the fatigue\ndamage in a part is due entirely to one operation, say pressurization, when the life to\n"action" is given in terms of the numbers of occurrences of that operation. Again the\ntime to action by the operator is based on the number of such cycles to failure in the\nfatigue test with the appropriate factor. In the case of pressurization, if the test is carried out by using maximum pressure differentials for every cycle and all pressurizations\nrecorded in service are assumed to be to maximum differential, the factor used is 31\nOne byproduct of the recording of fatigue meter readings after every flight together\nwith the type of sortie flown is that the load spectra are analysed on a sortie basis and\nused in estimating load spectra for future aircraft.\nIn general, it is felt that although the fatigue meter has provided and is still providing an extremely valuable method of monitoring fatigue life in service, more elaborate\nmethods are required to cope with the changes in the stress and centre-of-gravity acceleration relationship that now occur on most aircraft. Moreover, some monitoring system must be developed for areas such as the tailplane, fin and undercarriage for which\nmethods of monitoring are still in the exploratory stage and for which there is little or\nno operational data on load spectra.\nTHE GENERAL PROBLEM OF THE HELICOPTER\nIn general, the approach to the fatigue problem in the helicopter is based on the\nsame concepts as those used for fixed-wing aircraft; that is, the load spectrum and\nfatigue performance for each component must be determined and its life estimated and\nmonitored in service. In the helicopter, however, most of the critical items are\n223\n\ncontained in the rotating parts and their controls and these parts are subjected to fluctuating loads even under steady flight conditions. Therefore, large numbers of cycles\nare accumulated in a short time, and there is a consequent shift of emphasis to the\nfatigue behaviour at the low stress end of the S-N curve. This shift of emphasis results\nin one of the main differences between fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter requirements;\nall the factors are on stress instead of on life as factors on life become meaningless\nwhen the S-N curve is nearly horizontal. The fact that stress cycles are generated even\nduring steady flight has its impact on the estimation of load spectra. It is clear that in\norder to have any reasonable life at all, stress cycles in steady-flight conditions must\nbe below the fatigue limit. Therefore, the life is determined principally by occasional\nexcursions of the stress-cycle magnitude above the fatigue limit which are usually found\nto occur during a few transistory manoeuvres and short periods in a few flight conditions\nsuch as at high speed. Determination of load spectra becomes a process of defining\nthese manoeuvres and flight conditions, estimating the frequency with which they will\noccur, and estimating the magnitudes and numbers of cycles occurring in each of the\nmanoeuvres or flight conditions specified.\nTHE DESIGN-DEVELOPMENT PHASE FOR THE HELICOPTER\nEssentially, the same information needs to be written into the customer\'s specification for the helicopter as for the fixed-wing aircraft, that is, life required, types\nof sortie to be flown, operating weights, and stores to be carried. However, the estimation of load spectra from this requirement is in terms of frequencies of occurrence of\nthe various critical manoeuvres and flight conditions. Owing to the lack of measured\noperational data, these values have to be estimated from a consideration of how the\nhelicopter is going to be used. However, with the present state of knowledge it is virtually impossible to calculate the stresses arising in the many components associated\nwith the rotating parts and their controls during these critical manoeuvres and flight\nconditions. Consequently, at the design stage, the stresses calculated for steady cruise\ncondition are multiplied by 1.5 and maintained below the fatigue limit of the factored\nS-N curve. Past experience has shown that this method provides a reasonable design\nstarting point. The S-N curve used is either a relevant one from tests on similar components from a previous helicopter or a material curve with allowance for stress concentrations, etc. The factor at this stage is 2 on stress.\nDuring development, the loads and stress spectra are steadily acquired by progressive flight measurement on an extensively strain gaged prototype helicopter. Simple manoeuvres are flown, and stresses are measured, related to the appropriate S-N\ndata, and assessed for safety. The helicopter is then cleared for the next more complex\nmanoeuvre. At the same time S-N data are built up by constant-amplitude tests on the\nmore critical items.\n224\n\nHELICOPTER FATIGUE SUBSTANTIATION\nThe final life substantiation is based on flight measurements of stress, S-N curves\nobtained either by constant-amplitude tests or programme-load tests factored to allow\nfor scatter, and calculations using Miner\'s hypothesis.\nIn order to obtain the stress spectrum for each component, each of the manoeuvres\nor flight conditions considered likely to produce fatigue damaging cycles is flown at\nleast three times. In those conditions where the three flights give widely different\nresults, more measurements are made. In the first analysis only the maximum stress\ncycle is associated with each manoeuvre or flight condition and it is conservatively\nassumed that this cycle occurs at the typical frequency of the stress cycle in that component for as long as the manoeuvre exists. For those components and flight conditions\nwhere the subsequent fatigue analysis shows this analysis to give unacceptably low lives,\na more elaborate analysis takes place which provides a spectrum of stress amplitudes\nto be associated with that flight condition. The total stress spectrum can then be\nobtained for each component by using the frequencies of occurrence of each manoeuvre\nor times spent in each flight condition estimated from the specification together with the\nmeasured stress amplitudes for these manoeuvres and conditions. To allow for variations in stress from helicopter to helicopter when flying the same manoeuvres, the measured stresses are usually multiplied by a factor of 1.2.\nThe S-N curve for each component is obtained in most cases by testing at least\nsix specimens under constant-amplitude loading; normally three specimens are tested\nat each of two stress amplitudes. A curve of predetermined shape based on past experience is then drawn through the mean values of life obtained in each of the two groups\nand this curve is factored on stress values to allow for scatter. When six or more\nspecimens have been tested, a factor of 1.6 is used for light-alloy components, and\n1.4 steel and titanium. (The figure for titanium is provisional, being based on limited\ndata.) Where less specimens have been tested, higher factors are used. It is considered that gear boxes show less scatter than other components; therefore, a factor of 1.4\nis used if one gear box is tested and 1.3 if four or more specimens are tested. These\nfactors are appreciably bigger than those quoted in AvP 970, but are based on the latest\ninformation on scatter and current practice.\nThe fatigue life is then determined by using Miner\'s hypothesis except that a value\nfor\nof 0.75 is used. When the maximum stress amplitude in the whole stress\nspectrum is below the fatigue limit of the factored S-N curve for that component, the\nitem is considered to have a virtually infinite life. The fatigue limit for light-alloy\nspecimens is taken as that stress amplitude giving a life of 10 9 cycles and for low and\nmedium strength steels, that giving 5 x 10 6 cycles. Where testing of light-alloy\n\nIN\n\n225\n\ncomponents has only been taken to 5 x 10 6 cycles, a factor of 1.35 on stress is used to\nestimate the fatigue limit.\nFor components experiencing a complex load history, it is considered advisable to\ntest under a mixed load level to simulate more nearly the actual conditions, although the\nloads will be increased to allow for scatter and to obtain failures in a reasonable time.\n(This procedure is in contrast to fixed-wing practice where tests are conducted under\nreal loads for factored times.) The results are used to locate the mean S-N curve for the\ncomponent in the same way as for fixed-wing aircraft; that is, a predetermined shape of\nS-N curve is factored in the stress direction until the cumulative damage calculation\ngives the mean life achieved on test under the known loads.\nMONITORING HELICOPTER LIFE\nAt present there are no monitoring instruments for the helicopter analogous to the\nfatigue meter for the fixed-wing aircraft. Therefore, all components are assigned safe\nlives in flying hours. Although the helicopter is used in many roles, there has been no\nattempt as yet to define different lives for each role or record times spent in each role.\nConsequently, lives have been assessed in whichever role is considered to be most\nsevere for the component under consideration and those lives considered to be the\nretirement lives irrespective of the subsequent usage.\nFAIL-SAFE FOR THE HELICOPTER\nIt is clear from the previous two sections that in many ways there are greater difficulties in estimating safe lives for helicopters than for fixed-wing aircraft. The lives\nare very dependent upon a few transistory loads occurring during certain flight conditions\nand manoeuvres. The flight conditions themselves are not easy to define accurately and\nthe magnitudes of the loads within those conditions are likely to vary considerably\ndepending upon pilot technique and state of maintenance of the helicopter. Moreover,\nhelicopters of the same type are used for a wide variety of jobs; hence, variations in life\nof similar components are liable to be very large. In addition, minor damage such as a\nsmall score can result in a drastic reduction in life as the large number of cycles of\nstress otherwise below the fatigue limit are thus raised to a level where they add to the\ndamage. In the circumstances, designs to fail-safe principles are highly desirable from\na safety point of view.\nIt is often thought that this concept with its implication of redundancy can only be\nobtained at the cost of extra weight. It has been found in fixed-wing aircraft that this is\nnot necessarily the case and, in fact, once the principles of design detail have been\n226\n\nmastered, there may actually be a saving of weight in those areas of the structure\ndesigned by fatigue because lower factors to allow for scatter can be used in the design\nof fail-safe parts than could be used if those parts were safe-life. This condition occurs\nbecause it becomes no longer necessary to ensure that fatigue initiation probability\napproaches zero, the only criterion on frequency of fatigue failure being the economic\nones of maintenance and repair costs. The fact that so many of the helicopter rotating\nparts are fatigue designed and the variations of loading from aircraft to aircraft are so\ngreat and yet there are so few fatigue failures in service suggests that there may be\nappreciable overdesign and therefore significant weight saving to be gained by fail-safe\ndesign as well as the added safety.\nAt present, there are no requirements for fail-safe for helicopters in AvP 970,\nbut there should be no basic problem in writing such requirements in general terms.\nIndeed, the approach would be identical to that used for fixed-wing aircraft; namely, that\nany failure shall be found before the residual strength falls below an acceptable value.\nHowever, the real problem, once the principles of fail-safe as defined by the requirements are fully understood, is one of detail design and it is here that the main attack must\nbe made if the advantages of fail-safe design are to be realised. In addition, since the\nearly detection of failures or cracks is vital to fail-safe, it would be worth putting more\neffort into the development of inspection techniques. This effort may involve special\nsystems for particular parts, such as the blade inspection method developed by Sikorsky\nin which the blade is inflated and cracks detected by loss of pressure. However, it must\nbe remembered that helicopters frequently operate in relatively primitive conditions so\nthat simple techniques are required.\nFUTURE WORK\nThe procedure described in this paper for coping with the problems of fatigue in\naircraft structures which has evolved over the years has maintained an acceptable standard of safety. Nevertheless, every step in that process contains problems that could lead\nto inaccuracies. As the customer demands longer lives for his expensive aircraft, the\nneed for better life estimation is of paramount importance, both for the safety of safelife aircraft and the economy of fail-safe aircraft.\nThe areas in which effort is still needed can be considered in two main groups:\nthose associated with defining the load-stress spectra and those concerned with the\ndetermination of fatigue performance. If the load-spectrum problems are considered\nfirst, wing loads and fuselage bending loads are reasonably served by the fatigue meter;\nthis meter monitors loads on individual aircraft and provides operational data. However,\nwith the wide variation in the stress and centre-of-gravity acceleration relationship\n227\n\npossible in modern aircraft because of the high rates of fuel usage, and the large range\nof stores carried, some more direct method of obtaining stress spectra is required. If\nsuch methods should be developed for operational use, they would be invaluable in monitoring fatigue life consumption of fins, tailplanes, undercarriages, and possibly even\nhelicopter components, although in the latter case there is an additional practical problem\nof recording outputs through rotating machinery. In the event of monitoring by direct\nstress measurement being developed, it may be found that the process of feeding back to\nthe design stage will be more difficult than that for current monitoring methods using\ncounting accelerometers, bearing in mind that for both systems allowance must be made\nfor the response characteristics of the aircraft on which the measurements were made\nbefore these measurements can be applied to the new aircraft. This procedure is\nalready used to a large extent for response to turbulence, and the power spectral approach\nused in this connection is being applied to estimating undercarriage loads. However,\nmore work needs to be done in relating the theoretical work in this field to measurements in flight and during ground operations.\nThe problems associated with fatigue performance will now be considered. The\noutstanding need is for a new cumulative damage hypothesis that takes sequence effects\nand fretting into account. With the greater understanding of the effects of residual\nstresses around stress concentrations, it is hoped that methods of accounting reliably\nfor the former will not be too long delayed. In view of the increasing tendency to design\nfail-safe, there is a need for more work on methods of predicting crack propagation rates\nin complex structures under variable loading and the residual strengths of the cracked\nstructures.\nIt is unlikely that even improved methods of estimating initiation time, crack propagation rates, and residual strengths will enable us to dispense with the major fatigue\ntest. However, such improvements may help in the simplification and interpretation of\nthis test. There are a number of questions in this connection that still require further\nattention. Firstly, to what extent can the time-consuming low-level stresses be omitted?\nSecondly, what should be the magnitude of the biggest load applied in test? What precisely is the effect of a load equal to or greater than proof load on the subsequent\nbehaviour and can this effect be counteracted in any way ? This consideration is important in solving the problem of proving the residual strength of a cracked structure.\nTo summarize, it is considered that work will be required in the following areas:\n(1) Theoretical work on dynamic response giving load and stress distributions\n(2) Development of flight measurement and analysis techniques to check and modify\nthe theoretical assessments\n\n228\n\n(3) The development of operational monitoring devices measuring stress directly.\nThese devices may be expensive and consequently limited to use on a few aircraft.\n(4) The development of monitoring devices that can be used on every aircraft to\nmeasure parameters that can be related to the stresses measured on the more elaborate\ninstruments. It is considered essential on military aircraft that some monitoring device\nis used on every aircraft as the variations in load spectra on aircraft in the same role\ncan be very large.\n(5) Development of new cumulative damage theories to account for sequence effects\nand fretting\n(6) Development of methods of predicting crack-propagation rates in complex\nstructures under variable loading\n(7) Development of methods of predicting residual strengths of cracked structures\n(8) Assessment of what stress levels should be included in fatigue tests under\nrealistic loads\n(9) The development of aircraft capable of sustained supersonic flight means that\nmore work will be needed in the fields of estimating, measuring, and monitoring stresses\ndue to thermal effects, and interpreting their influence on the fatigue problem.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

Haviland and G. F. Purkey\nAeronautical Systems Division, U.S. Air Force\nUnited States\nSUMMARY\nThe United States Air Force has published a document entitled, "Aircraft Structural Integrity Program" (ASIP). One phase of the program is concerned with the\nfatigue life certification of all types of military aircraft. The document describes the\ncriteria, analyses, and tests that are necessary in order to satisfy the USAF fatigue\nlife requirement. The authors have noted that some recent and valid criticism has\nbeen directed toward the document, particularly the fatigue-life requirements contained\nin it. This paper proposes some changes based on surveys conducted in the United\nStates and abroad as well as some recent systems\' experience. The surveys covered\nboth military and civilian organizations. The paper contains the fatigue certification\ncase histories of selected military and commercial aircraft. The design development\nelement tests, preproduction design verification tests, and full-scale fatigue tests of\neach are described. The paper concludes with a brief status report on the revisions to\nthe MIL-A-008860 series specifications.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn 1965, Miller and Lowndes presented a paper before this group entitled "The\nU.S. Air Force Weapon Systems Fatigue Certification Program." (See ref. 1.) Their\npaper described the evolution of the USAF fatigue life requirements up to that time.\nOne section of the paper listed the aircraft which were considered to be the first line\nsystems of the USAF in 1965. These aircraft are as follows:\nFighters\n\nBombers\n\nTrainers\n\nTransport\n\nF-89\n\nB-47\n\nT-37\n\nC-130\n\nF-100\n\nB-52\n\nT-38\n\nC-133\n\nF-101\nF-102\n\nB-66\n\nKC-135\n\nF-104\nF-105\nF-106\n231\n\nOf these only the following aircraft were committed to a fatigue evaluation program:\nFighters\n\nBombers\n\nTrainers\n\nTransport\n\nF-101\nF-104\nF-105\nF-106\n\nB-47\nB-52\n\nT-37\nT-38\n\nC-130\nC-133\nKC-135\n\nFive years later, the first line systems of the USAF are as follows:\nFighters\n\nBombers\n\nTrainers\n\nTransport\n\nF-100\nF-105\nF-106\nF-4\nF-5\nF-111\nA-37\n\nB-52\nFB-111\n\nT-37\nT-38\n\nC-130\nKC-135\nC-5\n\nOf these currently operational systems, every one except the F-4 has undergone the\nU.S. Air Force fatigue evaluation program. The F-4 was procured by the U.S. Navy and\nhas not been required to conform to Air Force Aircraft Structural Integrity Program\n(ASIP). It is also acknowledged that the F-100 although not originally designed or tested\nunder any formal program has required several life extensions. Each one has been\napproved after additional fatigue testing. It is interesting to note that all aircraft now in\nour inventory have undergone a fatigue evaluation program of some kind. This statement\nwas not true 5 years ago. With this as an introduction, we wish to expand on the USAF\'s\nfatigue evaluation program and how it has changed over the last 5 years.\nHISTORY OF STRUCTURAL EVALUATION PROGRAM\n1965 to 1968 Period\nFigure 1 shows a typical structural evaluation program of the 1965 to 1968 time\nperiod. (Also see refs. 2 and 3.) At that time, ASIP required element and component\ntests, but the number and specimen sizes were left to the contractor\'s discretion. The\nstatic test, flight loads survey, and the first fatigue test were run concurrently. After\ninitial operational capability (IOC) the program called for service-loads determination followed by a second fatigue specimen to be tested to the service-loads spectrum. At that\n232\n\ntime, it appeared to be a good plan and the requirements formalizing the program were\nwritten as an ASD Technical Report 66-57 "Air Force Structural Integrity Program\nRequirements," dated January 1968 (ref. 4) and into various specifications and contracts.\nFor those of you who are satisfied with your program now, please note that in 1968 we\nbelieved that this program was the best in the world. Events proved us to be wrong.\n1968 to Early 1970 Period\nIn September 1968 the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and\nDevelopment, Dr, Flax, requested that a study be performed addressing problems associated with structural test program planning and with scheduling practices. (This study\nis referred to as the Flax study.) Briefly restated, the action items were\n(a) Examine current Air Force structural test procedures and policies for aircraft\nin development.\n(b) Assess structural test program scheduling problems.\n(c) Assess past and present structural testing to determine problems or deficiencies\nin established policies and procedures.\n(d) Provide recommendations to revise present Air Force structural test verification practices and policies, considering proper balance between program risks and costs.\nThe approach used in the Flax study was to prepare case histories of the then current systems and a number of typical earlier systems on which information was available.\nIncluded in the study were such data as original test schedules, the details of static and\nfatigue tests, actual start and completion of the tests, and the production rates. The case\nhistories were carefully studied to establish trends and to identify problem areas. With\nthese thoughts in mind, let us consider the actual structural program schedules of some\nof the Air Force aircraft that were used in the study.\nThe first aircraft is a large transport, the C-141. Figure 2 shows the schedule.\nThe C-141 comes as close as any airplane to fulfilling the total ASIP requirements. It\nhas a static test, structural flight tests, full-scale fatigue tests of two articles, and a lifehistory recorder program, the data from which are being used for the second fatigue test.\nFigure 2 refers to fatigue test articles A, B, C, D, and E which are shown pictorially in\nfigure 3.\nThere were a large number of engineering changes generated by the C-141 fatigue\ntest program. Most of them were incorporated in production but very late in time. You\ncan see that there were essentially no component tests. We did a static test and a flight\nloads survey almost concurrently as called for by the 1968 ASIP schedule shown earlier,\nbut the fatigue test was very late in starting. We had aircraft out in the operational fleet\nbefore we had one lifetime on the fatigue test specimen.\n233\n\nUsing hindsight, if we had started the first fatigue test earlier, we would have been\nable to incorporate the changes into earlier production airframes. Instead, we were\nunable to get changes into production earlier than the 200th airframe and we only had\n285 airframes in the production contract. The fatigue test article had been identified\nearly enough (it was the seventh airframe), but the actual start of the testing slipped\nbecause of management considerations. The lesson learned here was an important one.\nIf you have a production airframe, get started on the fatigue test as early as possible.\nIn order to understand more about how the commercial manufacturers design and\nbuild airframes, we will deviate from the Flax study and show you a comparison we made\nbetween the C-141 and, with the assistance of the Boeing Company, the Boeing 727. We\nfound that Boeing uses a modified form of ASIP. Boeing does everything that ASIP\nrequires, but not in as much depth or detail as we in the Air Force do. For example, a\nflight loads survey was conducted on the 727 because the FAA was interested in the T-tail.\nOtherwise, the survey would not have been flown. Our load survey on the C-141 was very\ncomprehensive.\nLet us consider the fatigue tests of the two aircraft. The preparation of the fatigue\nspectra for the C-141 was complicated by the large number of missions assigned to the\naircraft. Low level penetration, air delivery of cargo and wartime training missions had\nto be included in the spectrum. Therefore, the C-141 required about twice the fatigue\ntest segments needed for the 727. The Boeing 727 has essentially a single logistic mission at altitude.\nThe way we did our tests compared with the way Boeing performed their fatigue\ntests is also very interesting. A list of the fatigue test articles for the 727 and the 747\nfollow:\n727 and 747 nose landing gear\nMain landing gear\nAirframe\nWing\nFuselage\nVertical tail\nHorizontal tail\nControl surfaces\nThe horizontal tail was a separate test specimen for the 747. You have already seen\nthose for the C-141 fatigue test specimen in figure 3. We chose to break the airframe\nup into components so that a failure on one specimen will not cause an interruption to\nthe others. This method is more expensive than the method used by Boeing but it is\nless risky.\n234\n\nFigure 4 is a direct comparison between the test schedules of the C-141 and the\n727. The differences in magnitude of the scope of the tests are significant. Our static\ntest took longer because of down time and a need to retest the wing after uncovering a\ndifferent load distribution than expected during the flight loads survey. Our fatigue test\nalso took longer because of the multimission requirement of the C-141. The major differences between Boeing tests and the USAF tests are as follows:\n13 missions\t\n1 mission\t\n\nC-141\n727\n\nBoeing tests whole structure\nUSAF test major components\nBoeing performs modest flight loads survey\nUSAF performs full flight loads survey\nNow let us consider another Air Force aircraft test program, that for the F-5\n(fig. 5). This program was successful for two reasons: First, the F-5 airframe was\nessentially the same as that of the T-38 and the Norair N-156 which had undergone an\nextensive structural evaluation program. Secondly, the items that were changed on the\nF-5 from the T-38 were tested as components during the design development testing phase\nof the program. The primary difference between the T-38 and the F-5 was, of course,\nthat the T-38 was a trainer type aircraft designed for the training environment, whereas\nthe F-5 was a fighter type with external stores and tip tanks, leading-edge flaps, and drag\nchute; the F-5 was also designed for the close ground support fighter environment. This\ntype of redesign readily lends itself to verification of structural adequacy by utilizing\nsmall components or element testing. In the development of the F-5, it it had not had\nthe T-38 as a predecessor, the component tests would have been required.\nIt should be noted that the service-loads\xe2\x80\x94life-history phase was limited on the\nF-5 evaluation. It started late and was stopped much too early. If a continuous program\nhad been accomplished, the loss of an F-5 at Williams Air Force Base in early 1970\nmight have been averted. At Williams AFB, training is conducted for Military Assistance\nProgram (MAP) pilots. During this training a large number of 2g to 3g maneuvers are\naccomplished. The fatigue damage accumulated from this training is much greater than\nthe average damage accumulation and a fatigue crack developed in the center wing lower\nskin that caused the loss of pilot and aircraft. This fatigue critical area had been detected\nin the full-scale fatigue test. Had an adequate service-loads or life-history program been\nin being, the damage accumulation should have been detected and an adequate inspection\nprogram could have anticipated the need for repair.\nThe timing of the full-scale fatigue test also could stand some improvement in that\nit could have started sooner. Again, the previous T-38 tests along with the F-5 develop235\n\nment tests minimized the impact of the later start and did allow the use of a truly production configuration for the full-scale fatigue test.\nOut of the Flax study came some very significant recommendations:\n(a) Continue early static and fatigue tests\n(b) Emphasize component tests\n(c) Establish firm policy on structural integrity program\n(d) Perform cost effectiveness studies during contract definition phase between\ndevelopmental and production testing and between production build-up and structural\nretrofit. These recommendations were acicepted and we revised our ASIP requirements\ndocument ASD TR 66-57 (ref. 5). It was published in May 1970 and many of you are familiar with it.\nNow we want to discuss the present ASIP schedule, the one called for by the 1970\nversion of ASD TR 66-57. Before doing that, let us agree on some definitions of element\ntests, design-development tests, preproduction design verification tests, and full-scale\ntests. Element tests involve relatively small parts of the structure, joints, small panels,\nor stringer to frame splices. These are very small pieces but, as you know, extremely\nimportant to the structure. Design development and preproduction design verification\ntests consist of those tests of materials, structural elements, and structural components\nperformed early in the design phase to provide a realistic basis for the design analysis\nr\nand major structural ground tests. The design development tests are the most basic and\nearliest tests and are conducted to establish basic design concepts and configurations\nsuch as choice of materials, panel sizes, splices, fittings, etc. Preproduction design\nverification (PDV) tests are conducted after the design development tests, but prior to\nthe full-scale static and fatigue tests. These tests of full-scale components (wing carry\nthrough, wing pivots, horizontal-tail support, etc.) are conducted to provide early design\ninformation wherever analytical methods may be inadequate to achieve a high degree of\nconfidence in the strength and fatigue properties of the design. These tests are intended\nto reveal design "glitches" prior to the full-scale ground tests.\nWith these thoughts as background, let us consider our present ASIP schedule. It\nis representative of the program now being used on the F-15 and provided the original\nscheme for the B-1 (fig. 6). It requires that the contractor conduct early preproduction\ndesign verification component tests of major assemblies. It also requires two full-scale\nfatigue tests, the first as early as possible and concurrent with the static test and the\nflight loads survey. After IOC it requires a service-loads program to obtain the spectrum\nfor the second fatigue test.\n\n236\n\n1970 to Present\nThus far we have traced the changes to the ASIP fatigue evaluation program from\n1965 to 1970. Then we had some structural problems which focused national attention on\nthe structural integrity of some of our systems, notably the F-111 and the C-5.\nAt the direction of Secretary of the Air Force, Seamans, a group of experts was\nformed to look into the problems we were having or might have in the future. There followed a year and a half of study, reappraisal, reviews, audits, and an overall reevaluation of ASIP and its requirements.\nOne phase of the structural integrity review involved a trip to Europe. The authors\nhad an opportunity to visit some of you in your home countries of France, Holland, and\nEngland. We learned quite a bit from our discussions with you and have since been\ninvolved in various meetings and conferences on ASIP.\nWe had thought of ASIP as a logical, step-by-step program, which, if followed,\nwould insure a structurally sound airplane. But we were mistaken, those of you in\nEurope seem to be able to design and build sound airframes without a formal structural\nintegrity program such as ASIP. Moreover, we found that ASIP as applied to programs\nhere in the U.S. sometimes worked and sometimes it did not. The primary variable\nseemed to be the contractor or perhaps the type of contract and not ASIP itself. Thus,\nour experience has shown that the structural quality of an airplane is a function of who\ndesigns it and how he designs and builds it. It has had little to do with the ASIP documentation. This may be an oversimplification of the situation we face in the Air Force\ntoday. We realize that our treatment so far has not addressed the basic question of "Do\nwe really need an ASIP at all?" Even so, permit me to pursue a line of reasoning based\non the following premises:\n(a) ASIP should be effective regardless of the contractor or the contract selected.\n(b) It is not.\n(c) Therefore, ASIP should be changed.\nAs a result of recent systems\' experience, structural development cost restraints,\nand a review of international structural test practices, the Air Force is proposing a\nstructural development test program that is different from that used before. The significant change is in the method of fatigue evaluation, as you will notice (fig. 7). The preproduction tests of major assemblies and the early fatigue tests now required seem to be\nduplicative efforts rather than what is desired. The preproduction tests should identify\ndeficiencies that can be corrected in time for validation on the early full-scale fatigue\ntest.\nIn the proposed program, design development and preproduction design verification\n(PDV) tests that are more extensive than those originally identified by the USAF in 1970\n237\n\nare envisioned. The very early component tests must now provide for complete structural evaluation (strength, fatigue, fracture) of the major critical areas of the primary\nstructure. This is necessary (mandatory, even) inasmuch as these component tests are\nto be the main basis for determining adequacy of the design, proof of compliance, and\neven early life flight safety since the full-scale fatigue test will be delayed under this\nproposal. The PDV tests must be comprehensive. Note that this requirement is an\nintrinsic part of the proposed program.\nThe important scheduling of the full-scale static test and the flight loads measurement program retain their original timing. These tests are to coincide with the delivery\nof the first flight article and are to receive equal priority with other subsystem evaluation\nrequirements.\nThe major change that we are proposing focuses on the full-scale fatigue test.\nUntil now we have identified, in the initial system plans, a requirement for two full-scale\nfatigue tests, one strictly an early design evaluation test and the other a delayed test\n(approximately two or more years after initial operational capability) that utilized the\nresults of the earlier design evaluation tests (static test, fatigue test, and flight loads\nsurvey). This late fatigue test was also intended to be delayed until completion of the\nservice-loads recording program so that accurate service environment data would be\navailable. However, even when faced with the real-world past experience that all first\nline military aircraft systems (especially fighters) eventually undergo more than one\nfull-scale fatigue test, USAF management was unwilling to identify funds for two fullscale fatigue tests during initial program definition.\nRecognizing this situation and the increased emphasis that we are placing on early\ncomponent PDV testing and the desire to make the PDV tests effectively impact the design\nphase as well as the full-scale testing, we are proposing to identify a single fatigue test\nwhich will be conducted later than the first test and earlier than the second test previously\nrequired. This revised scheduling of the single full-scale fatigue test is necessary so that\nit will incorporate the findings of the PDV tests, static test, and the flight loads survey.\nIn all probability, it will not be delayed a sufficient amount of time to use the results of\nthe service-loads recording program.\nFinally, we recognize, and everyone else should also, that additional laboratory\ntests (even flight tests) may be required as extensive service experience is accumulated.\nHowever, no attempt will be made to identify any additional test requirements in the original development process.\nThere are definite critical control points in our proposed program that must constantly be reviewed as new systems are developed. There are also some important\nquestions that must be answered:\n\n238\n\n(1) Can the structures discipline effectively divert major airframe components\nfrom the ever present push to get a flight article as early as possible? Our proposed\nfatigue evaluation program has as its very foundation a comprehensive PDV test program that will require major structural components early enough to complete the tests\nbefore flight articles are produced. Can we win out against the competition and acquire\nthese early components in time for the structural evaluation?\n(2) The full-scale fatigue test can no longer be used as contractual proof that the\ndesign fatigue life requirements have been met. The test will now be based on results of\nearlier design and test information that cannot be accurately foreseen. Demonstration of\nstructural fatigue quality assurance requirements must utilize the PDV tests.\n(3) USAF management must be aware that major changes in the aircraft structure\nor mission may require further validation. Also, further validation may be required if\nthe single fatigue test did not contain inputs that are representative of the service environment for the original design missions.\nWe have outlined the proposed changes that the U.S. Air Force is planning in the\nfatigue evaluation program for future systems. These changes are planned to be incorporated into a revision of both the technical report ASD TR 66-57, dated May 1970, and\nthe appropriate Structures Military Specifications, commonly referred to as the 8860\nseries specifications.\nUPDATING OF SPECIFICATIONS\nMIL-A-8860 Specifications\nTo conclude our treatment of the proposed fatigue evaluation program, it may be\nuseful to review our recent progress in updating the MIL-A-8860 specifications. As a\nresult of the Seamans\' study, it was suggested that our organization (Aeronautical Systems\nDivision) have the prime responsibility for the documents. Previously, the responsibility\nrested with the Flight Dynamics Laboratory. We propose to cover some of the significant\nchanges we are making in three selected specifications as well as in the ASD TR 66-57.\nThe revision of the technical report ASD TR 66-57 will convert the format of the\nreport from an ASD TR to a MIL-STD-(USAF). In addition to the fatigue evaluation\nchanges just discussed, it is planned to include in the revised MIL-STD new or increased\nemphasis on materials selection, fracture mechanics requirements, and damage tolerance\ndesign.\nThe addition of the requirements for materials selection are presently being written.\nThe area of fracture mechanics principles is, of course, directly related to materials\nselection and some of the research work being accomplished in this area is the subject of\n239\n\na paper by Howard A. Wood, of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory (paper no. 14\nof this compilation).\nIn the area of damage tolerance design requirements, we have made some progress\nin updating our requirements. Since the new MIL-STD will only summarize the damage\ntolerance requirements that are contained in the MIL-A-8860 series specifications, our\ninitial effort has been concentrated on revising these specifications. In an attempt to\nexpedite the revision, the Air Force elected to revise and publish "USAF only" revisions.\nThese limited coordinated (USAF only) military specifications have been prepared by using\ncurrently available technical information, but they have not been approved for promulgation as a fully coordinated (USAF, Navy, and Army) revision of military specifications.\nThey are subject to modification. Pending their promulgation as fully coordinated military specifications, they may be used in procurement (USAF). The damage tolerance\ndesign requirements contained in these revised specifications are covered in the following\nsections.\nDamage Tolerance Requirements for Inclusion in MIL-A-008860A (USAF)\nThe primary structure shall incorporate materials, stress levels, and structural\nconfigurations which will minimize the probability of loss of the aircraft due to propagation of undetected flaws, cracks, or other damage. Slow crack growth, alternate loadpaths and systems, and other available principles shall be employed to achieve this capability. For this damage tolerance requirement, the primary structure is defined as\nincluding all structural elements the failure of which will\n(a) Cause uncontrollable motions of the aircraft within the speed limits for its\nstructural design\n(b) Prevent an aircraft from achieving speeds sufficiently low to effect a safe\nlanding\n(c) Reduce the ultimate factor of safety for flight design conditions from 1.5 to a\nvalue less than 1.0.\nDamage Tolerance Requirements for Inclusion in MIL-A-008866A (USAF)\nGeneral requirements.- Safe-life design shall be employed as the primary means of\nsatisfying the specified service life requirement established in appropriate contractual\ndocuments for each USAF aircraft system. In addition, damage tolerance concepts shall\nbe applied as a design requirement for primary structure vital to the integrity of the\nvehicle or the safety of personnel. This latter requirement stems from the recognition\nthat, despite concerted safe-life-insurance efforts through design, analyses, and tests,\nundetected flaws or damage can exist in critical structural components at some time during the life of the aircraft with attendant, serious consequences.\n240\n\nSafe life.- The fatigue critical areas of the airframe shall be identified through\nanalyses and tests (developmental, preproduction component, and full-scale article). The\nstructure shall be shown to withstand, without structural failure, the design repeated\nloads spectrum equal to the design fatigue-scatter factor times the service-loads spectrum.\nA service-loads spectrum is defined for one lifetime only and does not include a design\nfatigue-scatter factor. Modifications found necessary to satisfy this requirement shall be\nincorporated prior to aircraft delivery or by retrofit in fleet aircraft as agreed to by the\nprocuring agency.\nDesign fatigue-scatter factor.- The design fatigue-scatter factor is a factor to provide protection against fatigue failure of those fleet airplanes that experience a serviceloads spectrum more severe than the design service-loads spectrum and have fatigue-life\ncapabilities less than those of laboratory test articles. The design fatigue-scatter factor\nshall be a minimum of 4.0 or as otherwise approved by the procuring activity.\nService-loads spectrum.- The service-loads spectrum is derived from a collection\nof loads spectra. Each loads spectrum in this collection shall define the expected (average) number of load cycles according to load magnitude for a given source of repeated\nloads. The loads spectrum for each significant source of repeated loads shall be based\non a realistic interpretation of the design usage. The contractor shall include all significant sources of repeated loads. The sources of repeated loads may include, but not be\nlimited to, ground handling and taxiing operations, landing operations, flight maneuvers,\natmospheric turbulence, inflight refueling, autopilot, inputs, cabin pressurization, buffeting, terrain-following maneuvers, and the ground-air-ground cycle.\nDamage tolerance.- The primary structure vital to the integrity of the vehicle or to\nthe safety of personnel shall incorporate materials, stress levels, and structural configurations which minimize the probability of structural failure due to the propagation of\nundetected flaws, cracks, or other damage. The choice of damage-tolerant design concepts (fail safe, safe crack growth, or combinations thereof) for the design of specific\ncritical structural components shall be as agreed between the procuring agency and the\ncontractor. Analysis and supporting tests shall be conducted to evaluate the flaw growth\nand residual strength characteristics of the critical structural components.\nFail safe.- Primary structure that is designed fail safe shall be readily inspectable\nand meet the following requirements after failure of a principal structural element:\n(1) the remaining structure shall sustain without failure the maximum expected load or\nlimit load, whichever is greater, (2) the airplane shall be controllable within the design\nspeed limits, and (3) catastrophic failure of the remaining structure will not occur under\nrepeated load conditions during the period to the next opportunity to detect the failure.\nVerification of the ability of the remaining structure to withstand the repeated loads shall\nbe accomplished by determining the crack growth period from an initial flaw to failure of\n241\n\na principal element, and then ensuring that the life (including the factor of four) of the\nremaining structure will equal or exceed the time interval established for the next inspection. Inspection intervals shall be as agreed to by the procuring agency, but, in general,\nthese intervals shall be of reasonable duration commensurate with total system requirements. Readily inspectable structure is defined as that which can be inspected after\nremoval of access panels, doors, etc. Removal of permanent type skins and fasteners\nis not included. The details of inspection shall be agreed upon by the procuring agency\nand the contractor.\nSafe crack growth.- Critical primary structure that is not fail safe shall be designed\nso that initial flaws will not propagate to the critical crack length during the specified service life of the airplane. Through fracture data tests and analysis, the characteristics\nand dimensions of the smallest initial defect that could grow to critical size during the\nspecified service life shall be determined. Once these initial flaw sizes have been identified, quality control procedures shall be developed so that parts containing initial flaws of\nthese dimensions will not be accepted. In the event that the identified initial flaw sizes\nare smaller than the quality control detection capability, changes shall be made in the\nmaterials and/or stress levels so that larger initial flaws (compatible with quality control\ncapability) can be tolerated.\nDamage-Tolerance Test Requirements for Inclusion in MIL-A-008867A (USAF)\nFracture data tests.- Fracture data shall be generated during the design development test phase on all candidate materials for which no valid data base exists to support\nthe analysis requirements. These tests shall include plane strain and plane stress tests\nto determine fracture toughness values as well as crack propagation tests to determine\nincremental crack extension rates. These data shall be used for comparative evaluation\nof proposed materials and designs. Fracture toughness values shall be determined in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in the current standards. Specifications shall be\nprepared to ensure that materials having minimum guaranteed fracture-toughness parameter (K,C) values are used in manufacture where test specimens having dimensions that\nsatisfy ASTM requirements can be obtained. Continued sampling of final manufactured\nparts shall be accomplished throughout the production life to ensure consistency with the\nrequired strength and toughness levels.\nCrack propagation tests shall be conducted on element specimens to determine the\nconventional cyclic crack growth rate and sustained load growth rate data. These tests\nshall include the evaluation of the effects of various atmospheric environments (such as\ntemperature, humidity, fuel, salt, etc.). Spectrum tests of flawed specimens shall also be\nconducted when insufficient data exists or when proven analytical capability to predict\nspectrum effects is lacking.\n242\n\nCrack growth tests.- Crack growth tests of preproduction components shall be conducted as required to verify that the damage tolerance criteria have been met. These\ntests shall be accomplished by applying a spectrum of loads and environment that simulates operational usage which will determine the time to crack initiation and the time to\nfailure of a single principal element. These tests shall utilize, wherever possible, the\nexisting component structures fabricated for evaluation of the strength and fatigue properties as an "add-on" test effort. When necessary, additional component structures shall\nbe fabricated.\nThe revised structural specifications are as follows:\nSpecification number \t\nMIL-A-008860A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008861A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008862A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008865A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008866A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008867A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008869A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-008870A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-8871A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-8892A (USAF)\n\t\nMIL-A-8893A (USAF)\n\nShort title\n\t\n\nGeneral\nFlight loads\nGround loads\nMiscellaneous loads\nFatigue\nGround tests\nNuclear\nFlutter\nFlight test\nVibration\nSonic fatigue\n\nThese specifications listed are dated 31 March 1971 and are presently in printing; the\nestimated distribution date is July 1971. The MIL-A-008860A, 61A, 62A, 65A, 67A, 69A,\nand 70A are former ASG (joint) specifications which have been revised as USAF only\nspecifications. MIL-A-008871A has always been a USAF only specification. MIL-A-8892\nand MIL-A-8893 are new specifications which apply to USAF only.\nThe next two major efforts that are presently being accomplished are, revision of\nASD TR 66-57 into a MIL-STD, and full coordination on the revised specification will\nresult in ASG type specifications.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe are proposing the elimination of one full-scale fatigue test article and replacing\nit with early full-scale component tests. The full-scale fatigue test is performed later\nthan present requirements state but earlier than the previously required second fatigue\ntest. To formalize this change in the fatigue evaluation program, we are revising the\n8860 series of specifications and writing the USAF ASIP into a separate Military Standard.\n243\n\nThe authors wish to express their appreciation to Mr. Troy King for his assistance\nin preparing this paper.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

Schijve\n\nNational Aerospace Laboratory, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\nSUMMARY\nCrack propagation was studied in a full-scale wing structure under different simulated flight conditions. Omission of low-amplitude gust cycles had a small effect on\nthe crack rate. Truncation of the infrequently occurring high-amplitude gust cycles to\na lower level had a noticeably accelerating effect on crack growth. The application of\nfail-safe load (100 percent limit load) effectively stopped subsequent crack growth\nunder resumed flight-simulation loading.\nIn another flight-simulation test series on sheet specimens, the variables studied\nare the design stress level and the cyclic frequency of the random gust loading. Inflight mean stresses vary from .5.5 to 10.0 kg/mm 2 . The effect of the stress level is\nlarger for the 2024 alloy than for the 7075 alloy. Three frequencies were employed:\nnamely, 10 cps, 1 cps, and 0.1 cps. The frequency effect was small.\nThe advantages and limitations of flight-simulation tests are compared with those\nof alternative test procedures such as constant-amplitude tests, program tests, and\nrandom-load tests. Various testing purposes are considered. The variables of flightsimulation tests are listed and their effects are discussed.\nA proposal is made for performing systematic flight-simulation tests in such a\nway that the compiled data may be used as a source of reference. The data could be\nused for estimating fatigue properties in the design stage of an aircraft and serve other\npurposes as well.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe fatigue loads in a flight-simulation test are supposed to be a valid representation of the loading conditions in service. In the present paper, an attempt is made to\nanalyze the merits and the limitations of flight-simulation fatigue tests.\nRecently at the National Aerospace Laboratory, extensive studies have been made\nregarding fatigue crack propagation under random flight-simulation loading in 2024-T3\nand 7075-T6 aluminum alloys (refs. 1 to 3). Tests on crack propagation in a full-scale\nwing structure have just been completed and the results are summarized herein.\nAnother program on the frequency effect under flight-simulation loading is halfway\n\n253\n\nfinished. It also includes the effect of the design stress level. Preliminary data are\ngiven in a subsequent section.\nA comparison is made between flight-simulation testing and alternative test procedures. The objectives of testing are obviously important for such a comparison. The\nvariables of flight-simulation testing are listed and data on the significance of the variables are reviewed. The information is fairly limited as yet. Finally, a proposal is\nmade for performing systematic flight-simulation tests in order to compile data that may\nbe used as a source of reference.\nTWO RECENT NATIONAL AEROSPACE LABORATORY TEST PROGRAMS\nCrack Propagation in a Full-Scale Wing Structure\nUnder Random Flight-Simulation Loading\nThe fatigue test and the fail-safe tests on the wing of the F-28 aircraft were successfully completed in April 1970. It was then decided to employ the test setup and the\nwing for a general crack propagation investigation. The aim of the investigation was to\nstudy the effects of\n(1) omitting low-amplitude gust cycles\n(2) truncating very-high-amplitude gust cycles to a lower level\n(3) increasing the stress level by 25 percent\n(4) preceding limit loads delaying subsequent crack growth.\nThe wing loads applied by 12 hydraulic cylinders included gust loads, ground-to-air\ncycles, flap loads, and undercarriage loads. The load sequence was a random flight\nsimulation similar to the sequences applied in the certification tests on the wing and in\ntests on sheet specimens (refs. 1 to 3). A sample of a load record is given in figure 1,\nand the test setup is shown in figure 2. The gust load spectrum was approximated by a\nstepped function. (See fig. 3.)\nThree test series (A, B, C) were carried out and data from the certification tests\n(series R) were also used for comparison. In the certification tests the low-amplitude\ncycles were not omitted. The omission of these cycles in test series A reduced testing\ntime from 116 seconds to 46 seconds per flight; this implies a considerable time saving.\nThe certification tests were completed by three fail-safe tests up to limit load, and this\nallowed observations on the effect of limit load application on subsequent crack growth\nduring test series A, B, and C.\nThe numbers of simulated flights are indicated in figure 3. In each test series\n(A, B, C), groups of 2 to 4 artificial cracks were applied in the following elements: skin\n\n254\n\nbetween stringers, skin and stringer flange, stringer head (Z -stringer), and spar web.\nThe cracks were applied at similar locations with approximately the same stress level in\nall test series. In the certification tests (series R), a large number of cracks were\ntested; however, for comparison with the present test series only a few cracks could be\nused in view of the similarity of location and stress level.\nThe complete results as given in reference 4 showed low scatter in each group of\n2 to 4 similar cracks. A summary of the average results is presented herein. As an\nillustration, figure 4 shows average crack propagation curves for the skin when the\nstringer flange is also cracked. From similar curves, average crack rates were drawn\nand comparisons are made in this study.\nEffect of omitting low-amplitude gust cycles.- The effect of omitting low-amplitude\ngust cycles from flight-simulation loading (comparison of results of test series A and R)\nis presented in the following table:\nCracked component\n\nMaterial\n\nAverage effect\non crack rate\n\nSkin between stringers\nSkin at stringer\nStringer flange\nHead of stringer\nSpar web\n\n2024-T3\n2024-T3\n7075-T6\n7075-T6\n7075-T6\n\nSlightly slower\nAbout equal\n1.5 times slower\n2 times faster\n1.5 times slower\n\nThe fourth result in the table (Head of stringer) is believed to be an erratic one which cannot be explained as yet. If this result is ignored, the table indicates a slightly slower or\nequal crack rate in the 2024-T3 skin material and a 1.5 times slower rate in the 7075-T6\nmaterial. These trends are in good agreement with previous tests employing similar\nload sequences (refs. 1 and 3) on 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 sheet specimens. In those tests,\nomitting gust cycles with the lowest amplitude implied that the average crack rates were\nabout 1.2 times and 1.4 times slower for the 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys,\nrespectively.\nEffect of truncating high-amplitude cycles.- The effect of truncating high-amplitude\ncycles is presented in figure 3 where it is seen that the three highest amplitudes were\nreduced to the next highest one. A summary of the results of truncating high-amplitude\ngust cycles of flight-simulation loading (comparison of results of test series B and A) is\ngiven in the following table:\n\n255\n\nCracked component\n\nMaterial\n\nAverage effect\non crack rate\n\nSkin between stringers\nSkin at stringer\nStringer flange\nStringer head\nStringer head\nSpar web\n\n2024-T3\n2024-T3\n7075-T6\n2024-T3\n7075-T6\n7075-T6\n\n2.5 times faster\n2 times faster\n2 times faster\n4 times faster\n2 times faster\n1.5 times faster\n\nThe last column of the table shows that truncation of the high-amplitude gust cycles to a\nlower level in all cases accelerated the crack growth. On the average the crack rate was\nabout 2.3 times faster in test series B than in test series A. In reference 2 with flightsimulation tests on sheet specimens carried out at similar stress levels, the same\ntruncation caused a 3 times faster crack rate. Although the factor is somewhat higher,\nit is still thought to be a fair agreement.\nEffect of increasing the design stress level. - In test series C all loads applied were\n25 percent higher than those in test series A. Obviously higher crack rates should then\nbe expected which was confirmed by test series C. Unfortunately there was a fairly large\nvariation between the accelerating effect of the various components. On the average the\ncrack rate was 2.5 times faster in test series C. Sheet specimen data from reference 2\npredicted a somewhat higher crack rate, whereas results in the following section of this\npaper predicted a lower crack rate.\nEffect of fail-safe loads on subsequent crack propagation.- Several investigations\n(refs. 5 to 8) employing constant-amplitude loading have shown very long crack-growth\ndelays if the test was interrupted for a high load. The wing test offered an opportunity to\nobserve the effect of a high load on crack propagation under flight-simulation loading.\nTest series R was completed by applying limit load three times. Some 10 cracks that\nhad shown a reasonable amount of crack growth during test series R were left unrepaired.\nWithout exceptions, the limit load applications had a large delaying effect on the growth of\nthese cracks. Some examples are shown in figure 5. The vertical bar in the graphs\nindicates the stable crack growth during the three fail-safe tests up to limit load. Several\ncracks came to a complete standstill with a tendency to resume crack growth during test\nseries C (25 percent higher loads).\nIt was suggested now and then to apply periodically fail-safe loads in a full-scale\ntest. The argument was that hidden cracks would then readily show up. Unfortunately,\nthis might well be the best method to hide these cracks completely, since further growth\nwill be drastically delayed.\n\n256\n\nEffects of Frequency and Design Stress Level on Crack Propagation\nUnder Random Flight-Simulation Loading\nThe test program is still in progress and preliminary results can be presented only.\nTests are being carried out on 2024-T3 Alclad and 7075-T6 Alclad specimens. Specimen\nwidth is 160 mm and the thickness is 2 mm. The cracks are starting from a central sawcut notch. Some specimens were precracked by constant-amplitude fatigue testing to a\nsemicrack length 1 of 10 mm or of 20 mm. Others were given a saw cut to a semicrack\nlength 1 of 8 mm and were tested without additional precracking.\nThe load sequences applied are the same as those applied to the wing, with one additional feature. In each flight each positive gust load was followed by a negative one and\nvice versa. However, the amplitude for each half-cycle was selected at random from the\namplitudes to be applied in that flight.a\nTruncation of the gust spectrum occurred at the same level as shown in figure 3 for\ntest series B, whereas the low-amplitude cycles were not omitted. The first tests were\nstarted with the following values for the stress levels:\nMean stress in flight\t\n\nSill = 7.0 kg/mm2\n\nGust amplitudes\t\n\nSa = 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7 kg/mm2\n\nMinimum stress in GTAC Smin = -3.4 kg/mm2\nHence, the truncation level is Sa = 7.7 kg/mm 2 . The same values were applied in references 1 and 3.\nChanging the design stress level implies that all stress levels should be multiplied\nby the same factor. With the mean stress in flight as the characteristic stress level,\ntests are carried out at S m = 10.0, 8.5, 7.0, 5.5 kg/mm 2 . The gust amplitude and the\nminimum stress in the ground-to-air cycles are amplified accordingly. Test results are\navailable for a loading frequency of 10 cps. (See fig. 6. b) It turns out that the effect of\nthe stress level is different for the two alloys. At Sm = 5.5 kg/mm 2 , the 2024 alloy is\nstill far superior to the 7075 alloy. At higher S m values the difference is negligible.\nIt is thought that this relatively good behavior of the 7075 alloy should be attributed to the\nfact that favorable residual stresses are better maintained in this alloy. It is noteworthy\na In the terminology of Naumann (ref. 9) the wing loading employed "random cycles"\nand the specimens were loaded by "random half-cycles, restrained."\nb Since the stress histories were the same in all tests, except for the intensity of\nthe stress, it was hoped to correlate the data for different stress levels by employing the\nstress intensity factor K. The results were disappointing and apparently similar K\nvalues do not imply similar crack rates in this case. This is attributed to different\nK-histories in the crack tip area and predominant interaction effects of stress cycles\nwith different amplitudes. This issue will be discussed in more detail in the final report\nof this investigation.\n257\n\nthat a trend such as that illustrated by figure 6 cannot be predicted from constantamplitude data.\nThe effect of the load cycling frequency is studied by carrying out tests at 10 cps,\n1 cps, and 0.1 cps. Available data have been compiled in the following table:\n2024-T3\naluminum alloy\nCrack growth\t 21, mm . . .\nSm, kg/mm 2 .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\nLife in flights at \xe2\x80\x94\n10\t cps\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n1\t cps\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n0.1\t cps\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\t .\n\n7075-T6\naluminum alloy\n\n24 to 60\n10\n\n40 to 60\n8.5\n\n24 to 60\n10\n\n40 to 60\n8.5\n\n1105\n1262\n1234\n\n1235\n1116\n1200\n\n1382\n1265\n\n1520\n1360\n1350\n\nAs the table shows, the effect is not fully systematic but it is small, as might have been\nexpected from constant-amplitude data (refs. 10 and 11). Of course one should be careful\nabout generalizing the present data, especially if corrosive environments are present.\nFLIGHT -SIMULATION TESTING\n\nIn this section of the paper, various aspects of flight-simulation testing are discussed and a proposal is made for a systematic compilation of flight-simulation fatigue\ntest data.\nDevelopment of Several Fatigue Testing Procedures\nIn the past attempts were made to predict fatigue strength and fatigue life from\nsimple fatigue data. Several complicating factors were early recognized and extensively\nstudied. Examples are the presence of a mean stress as opposed to zero mean stress,\nthe presence of notches as opposed to unnotched material, and the existence of large components as opposed to small laboratory specimens. Other factors, such as the effect of\nsurface finish and fretting corrosion, led to an overwhelming number of empirical investigations. Qualitatively, understanding of all these influencing factors has highly increased.\nNevertheless, it is still generally believed necessary to perform fatigue tests on the real\ncomponents and preferably on a full-scale structure. For full-scale testing there are\nadditional arguments, such as a realistic representation of eccentricities and load transmission in the structure and the indication of accidentally poor design features.\nTesting a component or a full-scale structure implies that one wants to simulate the\nstructural configuration as realistically as possible. In great contrast with these efforts,\nan unrealistic simulation of service load history was usually adopted in fatigue tests.\n258\n\nSince the accidents with the Comets in the early fifties, several new designs were subjected to a full-scale fatigue test. Usually this was a flight-simulation test, that is, with\na flight-by-flight loading. However, the gust loading was highly simplified in many cases.\nA simulation of a complex load time history was obviously impossible in the early\ndays. In 1939 Gassner (ref. 12) published his first paper on program loading. He presented program loading as an improved method for estimating fatigue life although at that\ntime Gassner had already realized that program loading was still afflicted with important\ndeviations from load sequences in service. However, available testing equipment at that\ntime could not do a better job.\nAround 1960 random load fatigue tests started to draw much attention, partly\nbecause it became possible to carry out this type of testing. On the other hand, several\ntypes of fatigue loads in service had a random character. Moreover an elegant mathematical framework was available for dealing with random variables. Kirkby and Edwards\n(ref. 13) proposed to adopt narrow-band random loading in a way similar to that proposed\nby Gassner for program loading. This type of loading could still be applied in a\nresonance-type fatigue machine.\nA real breakthrough was the introduction of the closed-loop electrohydraulic system\nwith servovalves for monitoring the hydraulic load. An arbitrary load time history can\nbe obtained from a similar electric signal. This system is now being used for relatively\nslow full-scale testing as well as fast testing of components or small specimens. The\nsystem has been developed to a high degree of reliability. Actually the impossibility of\nsimulating a complex load time history has been eliminated. In other words, realistic\nload sequences can now be simulated in fatigue testing. It appears rather natural that a\nrealistic simulation of a component or a structure should then be combined with a realistic\nsimulation of service loading.\nPurpose of Fatigue Testing\nFor a discussion on testing methods it is useful to keep in mind the variety of test\npurposes and test articles. A broad summary is given in the following table:\nTest article\t\n\nI\t\n\nTesting method\n\n\t\n\nTest purpose\n\nLaboratory specimen Constant-amplitude test + (a) Basic data for fatigue life estimates\nComponent\t\n\nI\n\nProgram test\t\n\nFull-scale structure Random-load test\t\nI\n\nI\n\n(b) Comparative design studies\n\nI\n\n(c) Direct life estimates\n\nFlight-simulation test (d) Indication of fatigue critical elements, crack rates, and inspection\nmethods\nI\n\n259\n\nIt is thought that testing purposes (c) and (d) require a realistic simulation of both the\ntest article and the service load time history. Consequently, some type of flightsimulation loading is necessary. With respect to test purposes (a) and (b) different\nopinions may be held.\nThe utilization of constant-amplitude test data from laboratory specimens as basic\ndata for life estimates is a complex problem. A cumulative damage rule has to be\nadopted \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, the Palmgren-Miner rule. Then, the differences between laboratory specimens and the actual structure have to be considered. The conclusion has to be\nthat only very rough life estimates can be made in this way.\nGassner and Schutz (ref. 14) have proposed to use data from program tests as basic\ndata for making life estimates. A similar proposal was made by Kirkby and Edwards\n(ref. 13) for random loading. There are some indications that life estimates may be\nimproved in this way. However, discrepancies between the fatigue lives obtained in random tests and equivalent program tests (refs. 15 to 19) are not encouraging in this\nrespect. Moreover, uncertainties about the damage rule and the relevance of the specimens remain. Actually flight-simulation fatigue test data could well be used for this\npurpose.\nTest purpose (b) in the foregoing table is concerned with the comparison between\ndifferent components, materials, and surface treatments for the same application in an\naircraft structure. Many people still feel that constant-amplitude tests are a good means\nfor this purpose. However, the possibility of intersecting (or nonparallel) S-N curves\nis making this doubtful. In figure 7, test results at stress level Saj would indicate\ndesign A to be superior to design B. However, at stress level Sa , 2 design B appears to\nbe superior.\nAs an illustration of different answers to the same question, a recent investigation\nwith constant-amplitude loading (ref. 3) indicated that the crack propagation in 7075-T6\nwas 4 times faster than the crack propagation in 2024-T3. However, under flightsimulation loading it was only twice as fast. The data of figure 6 are also illustrative in\nthis respect.\nThe numerous test series with program loading carried out by Gassner and his\ncoworkers (ref. 20) indicate that the risk of a misjudgment would be much smaller if program loading were adopted for comparative testing. This applies also to random loading\n(ref. 21). Nevertheless, if flight-simulation loading can be adopted, it apparently is the\nmost preferable solution. Real problems should be tackled with realistic testing methods\nif possible. Recently Branger and Ronay (ref. 22) adopted random flight-simulation\nloading for exploring the fatigue behavior of a high-strength steel. Imig and Illg (ref. 23)\nadopted this method for studying the effect of temperature on the endurance of notched\n260\n\ntitanium-alloy specimens. At the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) as part of an\nad-hoc problem random flight-simulation loading was used to compare two alternative\ntypes of joints.\nVariables of Flight-Simulation Testing\nA constant-amplitude loading is easily defined by its mean, amplitude, and cyclic\nfrequency. For program loading, additional variables are (1) load spectrum, (2) amplitude sequence (the programing), and (3) the maximum and the minimum amplitude to be\nincluded in the test. For random tests, similar variables can be indicated. The\nsequence, however, has some random character rather than being programed.\nFor a flight-simulation test, the situation is still more complex because different\ntypes of flight loads have to be simulated, such as gusts, maneuver loads, and ground-toair cycles.\nThe main variables of flight-simulation loading, with some comments on their\nsignificance, are as follows:\n(1) Load spectrum\nObviously the fatigue life depends on the type of load spectrum. For instance, there\nare large differences between the load spectra for civil and for military aircraft. Usually gusts are important for civil aircraft, whereas maneuver loads are less important.\nFor military aircraft, the reverse is true. A realistic flight-simulation test requires the\nadoption of an appropriate load spectrum.\n(2) Load sequence\nIf a flight-by-flight simulation is adopted, the fatigue loads superimposed on the\nground-air-ground transitions can still be applied in various sequences. The effect of\nsequence was studied by several authors (refs. 1, 3, 9, 19, 23, and 24) and the general\nimpression is that in a flight-by-flight loading the sequence of the loads in each flight is\nof secondary importance. Although this is a convenient observation, it still appears to be\nadvisable to adopt a realistic sequence, which generally implies a random sequence.\n(3) Design stress level\nIt is clear that an increase of the design stress level reduces fatigue life. This is\nillustrated for crack propagation by the curves in figure 6. Similar data were found by\nBranger (ref. 25) with a hole notched specimen of 7075 aluminum alloy and maneuver\nspectrum, by Branger and Ronay (ref. 22) with a hole notched specimen of chromiumnickel steel and maneuver spectrum, and by Imig and Illg (ref. 23) with an elliptical hole\nspecimen of titanium alloy and supersonic transport load spectrum.\n\n261\n\nCurves giving the fatigue life as a function of the stress level applied in flightsimulation tests easily indicate the gain or loss of fatigue life if the design stress level is\nreadjusted. Actually such curves have some similarity with Gassner\'s "endurance\ncurves" (Betriebsfestigkeitskurven) and the curves of Kirkby and Edwards, who plotted\nthe random-load fatigue life as a function of the root-mean-square stress level. However, curves pertaining to flight-simulation data give more relevant information.\n(4) Maximum load allowed in the test (truncation level)\nThe wing test results presented in a previous section have confirmed earlier NLR\ndata, which indicates that the truncation level has a predominant effect on crack propagation. It is expected that this effect is more applicable to a gust spectrum than to a\nmaneuver spectrum in view of the different shapes of the spectra. Nevertheless, the\nassessment of the maximum load allowed in the test is a delicate issue. This problem\nwas discussed in reference 26; these results led to the recommendation to truncate load\namplitudes expected less than 10 times in the target life of the aircraft. This proposal\nwas made in view of the favorable effect of higher loads and the uncertainty that all aircraft of a fleet will meet those loads.\nAt the same time, it would also be unrealistic to truncate at a much lower level\nsince that may also lead to unrepresentative life indications. As a consequence, a realistic simulation is not compatible with a single loading pattern applied in all flights.\nObviously different flights should be simulated. (See fig. 1, for an example.)\n(5) Minimum amplitudes to be simulated\nThe results presented earlier for test series A have indicated that low-amplitude\ngust cycles may be slightly damaging in a flight simulation test. A similar indication was\nobtained by Naumann (ref. 9) when testing edge-notched 7075-T6 specimens. Remarkably\nenough Branger (ref. 25) found a small life reduction when omitting low-amplitude cycles\nfrom flight-simulation tests on 7075-T6 notched specimens (maneuver spectrum). Anyhow, if accurate data are required, low-amplitude cycles have to be included.\nThe situation is different for low-amplitude taxiing load cycles. If the mean stress\nduring taxiing is in compression, it was found in NLR tests (refs. 1 and 3) and by Gassner\nand Jacoby (ref. 24) and Imig and Illg (ref. 23) that omitting the taxiing loads did not have\na noticeable effect on the fatigue life. It is expected that this trend is applicable only if\nthe mean stress of the taxiing loads is either small or negative.\n(6) Loading frequency\nPreliminary results presented in a previous section indicated a very small frequency effect if any. More data from flight-simulation tests were not available in the\nliterature. It is expected that the frequency effect will be small for those materials that\nshow a small frequency effect under constant-amplitude loading.\n262\n\nAdvantages and Limitations of Flight-Simulation Tests\nThe advantages of flight-simulation tests are clearly associated with the fact that\nthe loading is a realistic simulation of the service load time history. For obtaining valid\ninformation on fatigue lives and crack propagation from testing components or a full-scale\nstructure, a realistic flight-simulation test is a necessary condition.\nFor comparative fatigue tests on competing designs or materials, constantamplitude tests, program tests, or random-load tests may be adopted. As explained\npreviously, it is not certain whether the comparative result will also be valid under service loading. This uncertainty is eliminated by realistic flight-simulation loading.\nWith respect to estimating fatigue lives in the design stage, one could start from\nconstant-amplitude data and calculate the fatigue life by employing a damage rule\n(Palmgren-Miner, for instance). This procedure implies a very large extrapolation with\na doubtful extrapolation rule. By starting from relevant flight-simulation data, the extent\nof extrapolation and thus the uncertainty will be highly reduced. In the following section\na proposal is made for compiling flight-simulation fatigue test data for this purpose.\nA disadvantage is that flight-simulation testing requires a more expensive fatigue\nmachine with more complex electrohydraulic systems. Actually the technical problems\nof this type of machine appear to be solved and the number of available machines is\nrapidly increasing. The closed-loop systems indeed allow a wide variation of testing\nprocedures and it is sometimes surprising to see the limited utilization of the potentials\nof the machine in fatigue tests.\nAnother limitation which appears to be more serious is that the load spectrum in\nservice will never be the same as the spectrum applied in the test. Although this is true,\nit is not a fair objection. If there are differences between assumed and actual load spectra, one might account for them by calculations or by testing. Unfortunately the PalmgrenMiner rule is unreliable for this purpose (ref. 3). It may even predict the wrong sign of\nlife corrections. The only realistic approach is to rely on empirical trends as obtained\nin flight-simulation tests. The test program proposed in the following section may also\nbe useful in this respect. For a particular aircraft, another solution is to conduct some\ncomparative flight-simulation tests with the initial load spectrum and the actual service\nload spectrum. This could be done on components or relevant specimens. In this respect\nit was stimulating to see a good agreement between the crack propagation results of the\nwing and those of simple sheet specimens.\nA Proposal for Systematic Flight-Simulation Tests\nIn the foregoing sections, flight-simulation testing was recommended as being a\nmore realistic approach to the problem of estimating fatigue properties. It was also\n263\n\npointed out that a compilation of systematic data from such tests would be helpful. A\nproposal for a compilation was made in reference 27. A test program for this purpose\nshould include flight-simulation tests with the following variables:\n(1) Type of specimen\nRepresentative riveted and bolted joints should be tested.\n(2) Shape of load spectrum\nSome typical shapes should be adopted, for instance, representing gust and maneuver spectra. If the effect of the load spectrum is known, one might interpolate for\nintermediate spectrum shapes.\n(3) Design stress level\nSome values should be adopted in order to study the effect of the stress level in a\nway similar to that of Gassner for program tests.\n(4) Ground-to-air cycles\nThe number and the magnitude of ground-to-air cycles may be varied.\nSuch a program, which could well be extended, may be considered as an exploration\nof the effect of several variables on the life under flight-simulation loading. On the other\nhand, it may serve some practical purposes. Firstly, the data could indeed be used in the\ndesign stage for making life estimates. Secondly, this type of information could also be\nuseful for correcting data from full-scale tests if the service load spectrum deviates\nfrom the test load spectrum. Thirdly, without actually having to design a standardized\ntest one could use the data as a standard for comparison when checking the fatigue quality\nof new components. A handbook with results from systematic flight-simulation tests\ncould be updated from time to time.\nIn fact, tests according to the foregoing program could be considered as collecting\nservice experience in the laboratory. In general, the experience from fatigue failures in\nservice does not become available in a suitable form because of insufficient data on load\nspectra, stress level, and structural configuration in most of the failures.\nSUMMARY OF RESULTS\nFlight-simulation tests were made with a full-scale wing structure to study crack\npropagation under different loading conditions. The results are summarized as follows:\n1. Omitting low-amplitude gust cycles from the flight-simulation test implied a considerable timesaving. However, it had a small but systematic effect on the crack propagation rate. The propagation rate was somewhat slower.\n2. Truncation of infrequently occurring high-amplitude gust cycles to a lower level\nconsiderably accelerated crack growth.\n264\n\n3. Increasing the design stress level increased the crack propagation rate.\n4. The application of fail-safe loads (100 percent limit load) caused a drastic delay\nof subsequent crack growth. Such loads increase the fatigue life.\n5. Good agreement was found between wing test results and results from tests with\nsimple sheet specimens. This illustrates that tests on laboratory specimens may indicate\nthe effect of modifications of the load spectrum.\nFlight-simulation tests were also made with 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 sheet specimens\nat loading frequencies of 0.1, 1, and 10 cps and at four design stress levels. Preliminary\nresults are as follows:\n6. The frequency effect was small and nonsystematic.\n7. The design stress level had a considerable effect on the crack propagation rate\nwhich was different for the two alloys. The difference could not be predicted from\nconstant-amplitude data.\nA discussion was presented concerning the meaning of flight-simulation testing for\nvarious testing purposes. The variables of flight-simulation testing and their effects on\nthe test results were discussed. The merits and the limitations of flight-simulation tests\nare summarized as follows:\n8. As compared with constant-amplitude tests, program tests, and random-load\ntests, a flight-simulation test is a more realistic representation of service loading and\ngives more relevant information. For a full-scale test or a component test, a realistic\nflight-simulation loading is an essential requirement for estimating fatigue lives and\ncrack propagation rates.\n9. For comparison between competing designs, materials, or surface treatments,\nflight-simulation tests give more relevant indications than alternative testing methods.\n10. If life estimates made in the design stage of an aircraft are based on flightsimulation . test data, the extrapolation of the test results is smaller and, hence, more\nreliable than for alternative procedures employing data from constant-amplitude tests,\nprogram tests, or random load tests.\n11. Since sufficient data from flight-simulation tests are not available as yet, a proposal has been made for a systematic compilation of such data. A handbook with this\ntype of data would also be useful as a standard for comparison. Moreover, the data could\nbe used for evaluating the significance of differences between the load spectrum of a test\nand the load spectrum in service. For this purpose, the Palmgren-Miner rule is\nunreliable.\n\n265\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Schijve, J.; Jacobs, F. A.; and Tromp, P.

O. Payne\nAeronautical Research Laboratories\nDepartment of Supply\nCommonwealth of Australia\nSUMMARY\n\nAlthough full-scale fatigue testing is now widely adopted in modern aircraft\ndesign practice, the current fatigue-life assessment procedures do not utilise all of\nthe test data that is obtained, and they only partly take account of the probability of\nfailure of the structure during the period in which it is being progressively weakened\nby the fatigue crack.\nThe present paper is concerned with the application of reliability theory to predict, from structural fatigue test data, the risk of failure of a structure under service\nconditions because its load-carrying capability is progressively reduced by the extension of a fatigue crack.\nThe procedure is applicable to both safe-life and fail-safe structures and, for a\nprescribed safety level, it will enable an inspection procedure to be planned or, if\ninspection is not feasible, it will evaluate the life to replacement.\nThe theory has been further developed to cope with the case of structures with\ninitial cracks, such as can occur in modern high-strength materials which are susceptible to the formation of small flaws during the production process.\nThe method has been applied to a structure of high-strength steel and the results\nare compared with those obtained by the current life estimation procedures. This has\nshown that the conventional methods can be unconservative in certain cases, depending\non the characteristics of the structure and the design operating conditions.\nThe suitability of the probabilistic approach to the interpretation of the results\nfrom full-scale fatigue testing of aircraft structures is discussed and the assumptions\ninvolved are examined.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years the development of high-performance aircraft using new highstrength materials and more refined methods of stress analysis to satisfy the ultimate\nstrength requirement has led to the fatigue performance of aircraft structures becoming\na progressively more important factor.\n275\n\nBasic studies of the fatigue behaviour of complete structures, such as those\ndescribed in references 1 and 2, have shown that a full-scale fatigue test of the structure\nunder representative loading conditions is essential to identify the fatigue critical areas\nand accurately represent the complex stress conditions under fatigue loading.\nAlthough full-scale fatigue testing is now widely adopted in aircraft design practice,\nthis usually consists of applying to a single test specimen a loading sequence representing\nthe service load history.\nComplete failure under the test load sequence or the appearance of a crack of a\nparticular length is defined as failure and the results are applied to determine a life under\nthe service loading conditions.\nHowever, such an arbitrary criterion of failure does not consider the increasing\nrisk of static failure to which the structure is subjected as it is progressively weakened\nby the growing fatigue crack. The actual risk of failure could therefore differ considerably from that obtained by the currently used methods of life estimation.\nFurthermore the difficulty of detecting very small cracks with current techniques,\ntogether with the susceptibility of the modern high-strength materials to the formation of\nflaws in production, may result in some probability of cracks existing in airframes prior\nto entering service.\nThis paper is concerned with applying reliability analysis to calculate the probability\nof survival as a function of life from the results of the full-scale fatigue test, including the\ncase of structures which may be initially cracked.\nNOMENCLATURE\nFootnotes for the nomenclature are found at the end of the list.\na\t\n\ncrack length (this may refer to crack length

by full-scale testing, the data provided by the test specimen representing the median structure of the population includes\n(1) Location of the fatigue critical areas\n(2) The median crack propagation curve\n(3) The life to final failure under the test load sequence\n(4) Residual strength data from static failure of the cracked specimen under the test\nload sequence, which include the failing load and the extent of fatigue cracking\nCURRENT APPROACHES TO SAFETY IN FATIGUE\nThe current practice is to obtain from these results a mean fatigue life NL,\ncorresponding to failure at some arbitrarily selected point on the crack propagation\ncurve.\nFor a safe-life structure, N L may be the life at which the specimen broke in the\nfatigue test or the life at which it would be estimated to fail under some specified load\nsuch as limit load. For a fail-safe structure, N L is often taken to be the test life at\nwhich the fatigue failure became readily detectable by the inspection procedures that\nwould be used in service.\nIn order to allow for variability in fatigue performance for either structure, the\nestimated mean life N L is divided by a scatter factor to obtain a safe operating period\nfor replacement or inspection of the structure. The scatter factor is obtained by using an\nassumed probability distribution of fatigue life with an acceptable probability of failure.\nDIFFICULTY WITH CURRENT METHODS\nThe difficulty with the previously discussed procedure is that although the safe life\nto replacement or inspection is based on failure at a given point on the crack growth\ncurve, there is, in service, an increasing risk of failure as the fatigue crack extends and\nthe structure may fail at any stage of the crack propagation.\nThis difficulty is well illustrated by the measurement of the collapse load of Mustang\nwings that were fatigue tested to destruction under a random load sequence (ref. 1). In\nfigure 29 of reference 1, the relative frequency distribution is presented for the load at\nfailure as determined by experiment. For the twelve structures tested the results indicate\na wide range in the failing load from 30 percent to 60 percent of the ultimate load of the\nvirgin structure. This means that for a given life the safety level in service may be significantly different from that indicated by the fatigue test result.\n282\n\nClearly the effect will depend on the shape of the crack growth curve and on the\nservice load spectrum; however to investigate the question further an example of an\nultrahigh-strength steel welded structure has been taken. The crack propagation and\nresidual strength curves of this structure are shown in figure 1 and indicate a reasonably\ntypical safe-life construction in that once a fatigue crack has developed there is a very\nmarked reduction in strength which leads rapidly to failure.\nThe probability of survival has been calculated for this structure by the conventional\nmethod, taking two rather extreme cases for the definition of failure as follows:\n(1) Failure occurs at the limit load. This is a relatively high value of the load,\nbeing near the upper limit of loads at which failure would be expected in service.\nNL = NsL(2) Failure occurs at the mean load. This is the lowest load at which service\nfailure can occur and it will give a lower limit to the definition of failing load. N L = NF.\nThe probabilities of survival corresponding to definitions (1) and (2), L sL and\nL F, have been evaluated for the two load spectra shown in figure 2 by a log normal distribution of fatigue life.\nIf NZ is the fatigue life to any crack length 1 and N Z is the median value, then\nz = NZ\nNl\n\nhas a logarithmic normal distribution and\nL F(N)\n\n= YNXR\n\npz (z) dz\t\n\nLsL (N) = YN/13sLpz(z) dz\n\n(1)\n\t\n\n(2)\n\nThe results are plotted for the manoeuvre load spectrum and the gust load spectrum\nin figures 3 and 4, respectively. For both spectra, LF is considerably more than LsL;\nthis indicates that the point on the crack growth curve at which failure is defined will\nhave a significant effect on the safety level.\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS OF FATIGUE FAILURE\nConsider a more representative model of the fatigue process in which a structure\nprogressively weakened by the fatigue crack may be broken by a service load at any stage\n283\n\nof the crack propagation. The structure may survive this risk and continue in service\nuntil the fatigue crack has reached the stage where the crack propagation curve is rising\npractically vertical. The residual strength of the structure then drops rapidly until it\nreaches the mean load when failure must ensue. This is essentially a case where failure\noccurs by the fatigue process alone and in this paper the failure is termed "fatigue\nfracture."\n\nThe risk of failure in this mode has been considered in the section "Interpretation\nof Fatigue Test Results" where the probability of survival LF(N) at the life N has\nbeen derived in equation (1) as\nL F(N) = ^N^&Fpz(z) dz\nand the corresponding risk of failure is readily obtained as\nr F(N) _ ^\t\n\npz (NI N F)\n\nYNZ&F\n\n(3)\n\npz (z) dz\n\nIn addition to the risk due to fatigue fracture, there is the risk of failure due to\nchance occurrence of a service load on a structure weakened by fatigue cracking although\nthe structure is still able to maintain the steady load. Current methods fail to take full\naccount of this risk which is called herein the "risk of static fracture due to fatigue" and\ndenoted as rs(N).\nThe total probability of fatigue failure at N is therefore given by\nr F I,(N) = r s (N) + r F (N)\t\n\n(4)\n\nIf it is desired to indicate a specified value of the service life, Ns may be used rather\nthan N; therefore, an alternative form of equation (4) is\nr FT(Ns) = r s(Ns) + rF(Ns)\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS WITH VARIABILITY IN FATIGUE STRENGTH\nFirst consider the risk of static fracture due to fatigue in the simplified case where\nthere is no variability in static strength but a characteristic distribution of fatigue life at\n284\n\nany given crack length. Next consider the probability of failure in the fleet at the Nth\nload cycle (i.e., the risk of failure at life N) of structures all containing cracks of the\nsame crack length a which may be expressed nondimensionally in terms of the crack\nlength a F at which the structure would fail under the mean load; that is, Z = a/aF.\nLet SN denote the Nth service load and R(1) the residual strength of structures\nwith crack length 1. R(1) is a decreasing function of l and may be expressed nondimensionally in terms of the ultimate strength \xc2\xb5 o of an uncracked structure as\nR\n\n=\n\n0(1)\n\n(5)\n\n\xc2\xb5o\n\nHence\nPr (Failure at life N I crack length 1) = PF(N/1)\nJ = Pr(SN \' R(Z))\n= Pr(SN = \xc2\xb500(l\n\'\n= F S (400[111\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Fs (s) is the probability of exceeding any service load s. The total probability\nof failure in the fleet at life N (i.e., the risk of failure at N) is then obtained by\nsumming over all crack lengths from 1 = 0 to 1 = 1\ndl\nrs , \xc2\xb5 (N) = J 01 p F( N/1) p (l)\n\nO\n\nFs 010$[1])p(1) dl\n\n\t\n(7)\n\n^j\n\nwhere r s,\xc2\xb5 (N) denotes the risk of static fracture at the life N assuming that there is\nno variability in the static strength at a given crack length.\nThe probability density function p(l) of the crack length 1 at any given life N\nis not known but this difficulty is overcome by transposing the variate from crack length\nat a given life to life at a given crack length. This is done by using the model of the\nfatigue process shown in figure 5 in which it is assumed that for any structure the life Ni\nbears a constant ratio z to the median life N1 at the same crack length 1,\nNZ = zNl\n285\n\nor by expressing life nondimensionally in terms of the median life to initial failure Ni\nN nl=znl\nl=\n\n(8)\n\nNi\n\nwhere z is constant for any structure and is called the life factor. By considering the\nshaded element in figure 5 it can be seen that structures with crack lengths between 1\nand Z + dl at N have initial lives between ni and ni + dni . Hence\np (l ) dl\n\n= p(ni) dni\n= p(z) dz\n\nni\n\nsince z = \xe2\x80\x94. This expression neglects the effect on the probability density function of\nni\n\nni of the very few structures that have failed between ni and ns.\nIf the equation of the median crack propagation curve\n1 = g (nl ) = g (nl/z)\n\n(9)\n\nis used, equation (7) can now be transformed by changing the variable of crack length 1\nto one of fatigue life represented by the life factor z. Taking z = n at 1 = 0 and\nn\nz = ,= at 1 = 1, equation (7) can now be written as\nnF\n\nr s \xc2\xb5 (n) = J n\t\nn/n\n\nF\t\n\nFs \xc2\xb5o ^(grZll p(z) dz\t\n\n(10)\n\n\\LJJ\n\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS WITH VARIABILITY IN FATIGUE STRENGTH\nAND STATIC STRENGTH\nIn the preceding section it was assumed that there was no variability in the residual\nstrength property, whereas, in general, at any crack length 1, the residual strength R(1)\nwill have a probability distribution about a mean value \xc2\xb5R (1). If the dimensionless\nvariate x(l) = R()is assumed to have a characteristic distribution which applies for\n11 R (1)\nall values of crack length, then\nR(1) = \xc2\xb5R (l) x(l)\n\n286\n\nand \xc2\xb5 R (1) can be expressed as a decreasing function of I from equation (5) as\nR(1) =\n\n\xc2\xb5 o o(l) x(l)\n\nThis is analogous to equation (6), and integrating over all crack lengths gives as before\nn\nr s(n I x(l)^ =\t J\t\nn\n\n4\n\nFs x\xc2\xb5 o 0(g rnj) p(z) dz\n\n(11)\n\nTo obtain the total risk of static fracture at n, integrate over all values of x(l) from\n0 to - to get\nn\t\n\n/\n\nr s (n) = Yo J\nFs x\xc2\xb5 o ^(g[Z] p(z)p(x) dz dx\t\n\t\nn^n F\t\\\n\n(12)\n\nThis equation is the general expression for the risk of static fracture by fatigue at\nlife n.

Sample test data for\nthe structure are shown in figure 1.\nThe crack propagation curve has been determined from the results of a representative full-scale fatigue test in which fractographic examination of the fracture surface of\nthe critical failures has been used to determine the crack dimensions at various stages\nof the test life. Although the curve in figure 1 is based on the crack length at the surface\nof the material, use of the nondimensional relative crack length 1 = aF enables it to\nrepresent also the crack depth or any other leading dimension of the crack front.\n\xc2\xb5\nThe residual strength curve \xc2\xb5 _ (P(l) has been estimated from the relationship\nR\'\n0\n1 = A 2 based on fracture mechanics theory, where A is a constant depending pri11R)\no\nmarily on the fracture toughness of the material and the shape of the crack front.\nThe variability in residual strength about the mean value \xc2\xb5 R was assumed to\nfollow the three parameter Weibull distribution, and with representative data on small\nsteel specimens (ref. 3), the following expression was obtained for the probability distribution of the relative residual strength x =\n11R\nP\t x ()\t =Pr\t R x =1-\t ex\t _ x - 0.824\nx\np 1.017 - 0.824\n^\xc2\xb5R -\t\n\n2.55\n\nThe crack length at failure under limit load, according to the relevant fatigue test\ndata used, is approximately 0.08 in., giving a crack depth of 0.04 in. for a semicircular\ncrack.\nThe distribution of fatigue life about the median value was assumed to be log normal\nwith variance u.2 g N of 0.02.\n289\n\nTwo service load spectra were assumed as shown in figure 2. Spectrum I is a\nspectrum of manoeuvre load derived from data on U.S. jet fighter operations in reference 4. A median life to initial failure of 2000 hours was assumed to correspond to the\nfatigue test result, and an ultimate load factor of 10 was assumed, which gives a mean\nload of 10 percent of the design ultimate.\nSpectrum II was based on thunderstorm gust load data from reference 5 giving the\nprobability of exceeding a gust load U as Fu (U) = e-0.197U Expressing load nondimensionally as\nY= S\nStilt\nwhere S is the load due to a gust velocity U and Stilt is the load corresponding to\nthe ultimate design gust velocity of 99 fps with the mean load of the aircraft assumed to\nbe 20 percent of the design ultimate, gives the following equation for the gust load\nspectrum:\nFs(Y) = e- 24.4(Y-0.2)\nA life to initial failure of 20 000 hours was assumed as typical of this type of spectrum.\nThe four different risk functions of equations (1), (2), (10), and (12) have been\nevaluated by using numerical analysis techniques (ref. 6) for both spectra I and H. The\ncorresponding probabilities of survival to life n have been calculated from the relation- fp r (t) dt\nship L(n) = e\t\nand are plotted for spectrum I and spectrum II in figures 3 and 4,\nrespectively.\nThese results show that conventional safe-life estimates as represented by LsL\n(Ls L corresponds to static fracture of a fatigue cracked structure under limit load and\nis in accordance with current life estimation procedures) can be inaccurate since they\nfail to take proper account of the risk of static fracture of the structure weakened by the\ngrowing fatigue crack.\nComparison of L s and Ls1\xc2\xb5 indicates that the variability in residual strength\nhas a significant effect on the probability of survival (or failure). The probability of\nsurvival L F refers to failure due to the .fatigue fracture extending to the stage where the\nstructure is not able to sustain the steady mean load. The risk from this type of failure is\noften small but as mentioned previously it must be included in the total risk.\n\n290\n\nRISK OF FAILURE IN STRUCTURES INITIALLY CRACKED\nWith the high-strength materials of low ductility now being introduced into aircraft\nconstruction there is a difficulty of detecting very small cracks with current nondestructive inspection (NDI) techniques. This factor together with the susceptibility of these\nhigh-strength materials to the formation of flaws in the production process may result in\na probability of cracks existing in a number of aircraft structures before they go into\nservice\nSTRUCTURES WITH INITIAL CRACKS OF CONSTANT LENGTH\nIn the most adverse case, all structures are assumed to be cracked in the fatigue\ncritical areas to a relative crack length t o which corresponds to the maximum length of\ncrack that will escape detection. According to this assumption all structures start their\nservice life with a crack of length to present.\nIn the model of the fatigue process illustrated in figure 5, all the crack propagation\ncurves can be regarded as radiating from a single point or pole P. If all structures are\ninitially cracked to the same length L o , this corresponds to shifting the pole to the\npoint P\' with coordinates (no,lo) as shown in figure 6. Each structure now starts its\nservice life h at the life n o which would have produced a fatigue crack of length to\nin this particular structure. This infers that the initial crack or defect induces the same\nstress field as a fatigue crack of the same dimensions in the area being considered. It\nmay be regarded as a fair assumption since under repeated loading the defect will rapidly\ninitiate a fatigue crack which can be expected to give rise to a similar stress field as that\nwhich would result if the crack had been produced by fatigue alone.\nReferring to figure 6 shows that for any structure which has a life factor z = nl/nl,\nthe service life h l to any crack length Z is given by\nhl = 111 - no = znl - zno = z (nl - no)\nFor the median values,\nhl = nl - no\n\nHence\nhl = zfil\t\n\n(15)\n\n291\n\nTherefore, the same model of the crack propagation process applies as for structures\nwithout initial cracks except that the origin is shifted to (n o ,lo), the service life is given\nby hs = (ns - no) = z (ns - no) = zhs, and the equation of the median crack propagation\ncurve is transformed to\nZ = g(fil + n o) = g (-z + no)\t\n\n(16)\n\nThe risk of failure is therefore obtained in the same way as for structures initially\nuncracked, and by integrating over crack lengths from Z = to to 1 = 1, the following\nequation is obtained from equation (7) :\n1\nrs,\xc2\xb5(n 110) =\n\ndl\t\n\n(17)\n\nJl 0\nFs^\xc2\xb5o0(1^ p(1)\n\nHence if the variable is changed from one of crack length to one of fatigue life at a\ngiven crack length as represented by the life factor z, the following equation is obtained\nfrom equations (17) and (16) :\n00\t\nhs\n\ndz\t\nrs,\xc2\xb5(hs 110) = ^hs/(4-flo) FsOOL^Z + no)] p (z)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere rs,\xc2\xb5(hs (lo ) denotes the risk of failure at a particular operating life hs of\nstructures having initial cracks of length t o and having no variability in residual\nstrength.\nThe corresponding expression when there is a probability distribution of residual\nstrength x given by p(x) can be derived from equation (18) as\nx 0 [g\nr s(h s 1 Zo) _ ^^ ^^\t\nFs 11 (p (z + no)1 p(z) p(x) dz dx\t\n0 hs^(nF-no)\nwhere r s (hs Zo) denotes the risk of failure at service life hs for structures which\nare all cracked to a length Z o at the start of their service life.\nThe risk of failure by fatigue fracture for this case follows from the expression\ngiven in equation (3) and is\n\n292\n\n(19)\n\n\t\n\np\t\n\n\tz\n\n\t\n\nrF(hs lo) _\t\n\nhs\n\n1\n\n\\nF \' no/\n\npz ( z )\n\n(20)\ndz\n\nhs / ^nF-no^\n\nThe corresponding probabilities of survival can then be calculated as before.\nSTRUCTURES WITH INITIAL CRACKS OF VARIOUS LENGTHS\nIn the general case the population of structures will contain cracks ranging from\nzero length up to the detectable length Lo and it can be assumed that there is a probability of a structure containing a crack of length l c between 0 and to as given by\nthe probability density function p(1c) .\nConsider the fraction of the population p(lc) dlc which has initial crack lengths\nbetween lc and lc + dlc. The probability of failure at hs for these structures is\ngiven by r(hs I lc) according to equation (19).

The load spectrum used in the calculations was the manoeuvre load spectrum shown in figure 2 as spectrum I.\nFor the case of structures all initially cracked to the same extent, the relative\ncrack length Zo has been taken as 0.075 from a consideration of the crack detection\ncapability of the NDI techniques used in production.\nFor the case where it is assumed that there is a continuous probability distribution\nof initial crack size, an exponential distribution of initial crack length Zc has been\nadopted with the probability density function\np( Z c)- 26.2e-\n\n20.61c\t\n\n(0 < Zc < 0.075)\t\n\n(31)\n\n295\n\nThe exponential distribution has been adopted since it follows from the physically\nrealistic assumption that the occurrence of a defect in a small element of the material\nfollows a uniform probability law over the whole volume.\nThe detectable crack length 1 D for in-service inspections has been taken as 0.15.\nAs stated in the section "Structures With Initial Cracks of Constant Length," the\ntheory assumes that the initial defect produces the same stress field as a fatigue crack\nthe same size as the defect. In applying fracture mechanics theory to deduce crack\npropagation and residual strength characteristics, the depth of the crack is the important\nparameter; whereas for crack detection, the length of the crack exposed at the surface is\nthe controlling factor. However, with the nondimensional relative crack length\n1= aF\na\n\n(32)\n\nit is immaterial whether crack length or crack depth is taken since both yield the same\nvalue of 1, provided the shape of the crack front does not change markedly as the crack\npropagates.\nIn establishing the detectable relative crack lengths to and 1D , it has been\nassumed that the crack length exposed at the surface which will be detected by the best\navailable methods is 0.02 inch for production-line conditions and 0.04 inch for in-service\ninspections. Assuming a semicircular crack front, which is often characteristic of\ncracks originating at a surface, gives corresponding crack depths of 0.01 and\n0.02 inch.\nA value of aF of 0.132 inch was obtained from typical crack propagation data by\ndetermining the crack depth at which the crack propagation curve becomes vertical since\nthis is virtually equivalent to failure at mean load. The relative crack lengths to and\n1D given previously were thus obtained from equation (32).\nWith these input data, the risk functions r s *(h 1 0.01") and rs*(h I p(lc)) for the\ntwo cases of constant initial crack depth of 0.075 and an exponential distribution of initial\ncrack depths have been evaluated from equations (19) and (23) and are plotted in figures 7\nand 9, respectively. The corresponding survivorship functions are plotted in figures 8\nand 10. The probability distribution of the failing load at various service lives h s has\nbeen calculated from equation (28) and the results are presented in figure 11.\nIt is apparent that the presence of initial cracks greatly increases the risk of failure\nat a given life. Also the risk of failure at the beginning of the service life is finite in this\ncase as distinct from the case where all structures are without cracks initially. This\narises because with all structures cracked initially every member of the fleet is exposed\nto the risk of static fracture from the outset.\n296\n\n\t\n\nSAFETY BY INSPECTION\nAs inspection techniques become more highly developed, increasing applications\nare likely to be found in monitoring structural safety. However, inspections of a complex\naircraft structure are both time consuming and costly, and the efficient planning of\ninspection intervals is becoming an essential requirement. The reliability approach by\ncalculating the risk of failure as a function of life enables the effect of any inspection procedure to be investigated and suitable inspection intervals to be planned.\nCONTINUOUS INSPECTION\nThe optimum effect of inspection is, of course, obtained when every structure is\ninspected continuously. As soon as cracks reach the detectable length 1 D, remedial\naction is taken and therefore the risk of fatigue fracture is eliminated.\nThe risk of failure is then equal to the risk of static fracture by fatigue which is\ndetermined by calculating the probability of failure for structures with crack lengths\nbetween l = 0 and 1 = 1D.\nIf structures are repaired and replaced when cracks are detected, there is no\nreduction in size of the fleet and the risk of failure at any life ns is obtained by inten\ns\ngrating in equation (12) between the limits z = \xe2\x80\x94 to z = ns since this corresponds to\nED\n\nintegrating over crack lengths between 0 and 1D. (See fig. 5.)\nHence the risk of failure for "continuous inspection with replacement" is given by\n\nrI*(ns\';lD,ns)\n\ns]\nf 0 Fs^ \xc2\xb5o.Cg[Z p (x) p ( z) dx dz\t\ns\t\nx\n=Sns/"D\n\n(33)\n\nThe corresponding result for structures which are initially cracked is found in a\nsimilar manner from equation (20); that is,\nn\n\nrj*(hs\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94n\t\n\noo co\n\no\n\ns\n\nFs x\xc2\xb5 q)[g(z + n\nP^Zc);ZD,hs^ _ ( c o ( (\nn1 O Jh s/^nD-nc^\nnc=\n\nJ\n\n]\nl\nc/ P(z) P(x) p(nc) dz dx dn c\n\n(34)\n\nWhen cracked structures are not repaired but are taken out of service after detection, there is a continual depletion of the population since at life n s all structures which\nhave a life less than ns at crack length 1D are eliminated by inspection; that is, the\nand hence the proportion of the\ndistribution of fatigue life p(z) is truncated at z =\nS\nD\n0\t\npopulation remaining at life ns is given by fns/nD p(z) dz.\n297\n\n\t\n\nTherefore, for "inspection without replacement" the risk of failure at ns (which\nis the probability of failure in the fleet remaining at ns) is derived from equation (33) as\nri(ns;ZD,ns)\n\nrI*(ns;ZD,ns)\n_\n00\nYn HD\n\np (z )\n\n(35)\n\ndz\n\nIn a similar way the risk of failure for inspection without replacement in a population of\nstructures which are initially cracked follows from equation (34) as\nr l(h s I Nlc);\t Z D, h s^ \xc2\xb0\t\n\nrI*(hs I P(Zc);ZD,hs)\nn c =no\n_\t\n\nC\t\ni\'i\n\n(_\t\n\n(36)\n\np(z) P( n c) dz dnc\n\nhs/lnD_fQ\n\nINSPECTION FOR LIMITED RISK\nIn practice, it is usually not economic or even feasible to inspect structures continuously but inspection is carried out at predetermined intervals. A method is proposed\nfor the efficient planning of inspection intervals in which, when the risk of static fracture\nby fatigue reaches a prescribed upper limit, an inspection is carried out. The risk of\nfailure is reduced at this stage to the same value as the risk of failure with continuous\ninspection, but it rises as the life continues until it again reaches the prescribed risk\nlimit when a second inspection is carried out.\nRepeated application of this process ensures that each inspection is equally effective\nin maintaining the risk of failure below a prescribed upper limit. The application of the\nprocedure is shown in a subsequent section, and the expression for the risk function is\npresented in the appendix.\nCRACK DETECTION RATE\nIt is important to determine the probability of cracks being detected at each inspection since this gives the fraction of the fleet that can be expected to require repair and\nmodification before continuing in service.\nReference to the model of the fatigue process in figure 5 shows that in the first\ninspection at life nI(1) all structures with crack lengths between 1 = Z D and 1 = 1 are\neliminated. These correspond to structures which have values of z between z = nI 1\nnD\n\n298\n\nand z = fi 1 . Hence the fraction of the population in which cracks are expected to be\nnF\n\nrevealed at the first inspection is given by\nnI(1)/nD\nr D %nI(1) ; 1 D ^ =\n\n\t\nYnI(1)/ nF\n\n(37)\n\np(z) dz\t\n\nOr in general for the mth inspection, the probability of cracks being detected in a structure is given by\nn\t\n\nnD\t\n\nrD*(nI(m);\'D,nI(m-1)) = S I(m) N _ p ( z ) dz\nnI(m-1)/nD\n\n(38)\n\nwhere rD*(nI(m);ZD,nI(m-1)) denotes the probability of finding cracks at the mth\ninspection at life m I ( m ) following the previous inspection at life nI(m-1)\xe2\x80\xa2 It is\nassumed that cracks with a length greater than Z D will be detected and that structures\nin which cracks have been detected will be repaired and returned to service.\nFor structures with initial crack lengths Z = Z o it can be seen by reference to\nfigure 6 that the probability of detecting cracks is\nh\t\nrD\t * (h\t I(m)^ Z o ^Z D^ I(m-1))\t\n\nhI(m)/^nD-no^\np(z) dz\t\n\n(39)\n\nhI(m-1) /^nD-no)\n\nwhere, with a similar notation as for equation (38), rD*(hl(m) I lo;ZD,hI(m-1)) denotes\nthe probability of detection at the mth inspection after a period of operation in service of\nhI(m), following a previous inspection at hI(m-1)\xe2\x80\xa2 It is again assumed that all cracks\nwith a length exceeding ID will be detected and nD and n o denote the lives on the\nmedian crack propagation curve corresponding to crack lengths of ID and Zo.\nIf the population of structures has a continuous distribution p(1c) of initial crack\nlengths between Zc = 0 and Zc = 1 the probability of detection can be derived from\nequation (39) by integrating over the initial crack lengths from Zc = 0 to l c = Zo,\n^\nr D * ( hI(m) p (Z c); Z D, h I(m-1)) = JO\n\no Shj(m)/(^!D - !Q\n\nh n P(z)p(lc) ^c\nI(m-1)/( D -n c`\n\nor\n\n299\n\nno rhI(n1)/(nD-nc^\n\np (z) p (nc) dz ^c\t\nrD* (hI(m) I p (l c) ;lD,h I(m-1)) _ ^ai\nhI(m-1)/(nD-nc)\n\n(40)\n\nexpressing lc in terms of the corresponding life nc according to the median crack\npropagation curve, and integrating with nc = n i at lc = 0 and nc = no at lc = lo.\nAPPLICATION\nThe foregoing theory has been applied to demonstrate the effect of planned inspection procedures for the case of a high-strength steel structure under a manoeuvre load\nspectrum (spectrum I in fig. 2) which has been considered previously.\nThe risk function for fatigue failure with continuous inspection has been calculated\nby using numerical analysis procedures (ref. 6) for the three cases of structures without\ninitial cracks, structures with initial cracks of constant length to, and structures with a\ndistribution of initial crack sizes given by the probability density function p(lc). The\nrisk functions for periodic inspection with limited risk have been calculated for the same\nthree cases. The results have been plotted in figures 12, 7, and 9, respectively, and the\ncorresponding survivorship functions are shown in figures 13, 8, and 10. The inspection\nintervals for inspection with limited risk for each of the three cases are shown in table I\ntogether with the expected detection rate at each inspection which has been calculated\naccording to the procedure developed in the preceding section.\nWith periodic inspection, the risk function returns to the continuous inspection curve\nat each inspection. The continuous inspection curve therefore has a basic significance\nsince it indicates the maximum extent to which the risk of failure can be reduced by\ninspection.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS\nConsider the results of applying the foregoing theory to the case of the high-strength\nsteel structure described previously with particular reference to the suitability of the failsafe and safe-life procedures.\nRISK OF FATIGUE FAILURE\nReference to the risk functions r sL and r F in figure 14 illustrates the difficulty\nwith the conventional approach. As the life extends, the difference in these two risks\nbecomes considerable, although as was stated in the section "Interpretation of Fatigue\n\n300\n\nTest Results" they merely represent two rather extreme conditions in the application of\nthe conventional safe-life approach.\nIn fact, the risks rsL and r F differ only in the point on the crack growth curve\nat which failure is taken to occur. This difference introduces a problem in the interpretation of the fatigue test result since the structure under a representative test load\nsequence may well fail at a rather different stage of the crack propagation curve as compared with the structures that happen to fail at a relatively short fatigue life in service.\nThis can be seen by reference to the curves of the probability distribution of the\nfailing load in figure 15. These show that at lives typical of service operation (n = 1.0\nto 1.25), the expected value of the failing load, for the few structures that fail, is relatively high, being above the limit load, whereas at longer lives the expected value of the\nfailing load is considerably reduced. Therefore the fatigue test specimen, representing\nthe average structure, is likely to fail at loads considerably below those at which service\nfailures will occur.\nThe basic difficulty is that neither r sL nor r F represents the true situation in\nthat they do not take account of the fact that there is some probability of failure at all\npoints along the crack propagation curve as the fatigue crack extends. This effect (the\nrisk of static fracture) is taken account of by L sI/I (n) which, as can be seen in figures 3\nand 4, gives an increased probability of failure for the example taken.\nAnother effect of considerable importance in considering static fracture due to\nfatigue is the variability in residual static strength of cracked structures since this may\nhave a significant effect on the probability of failure (or survival) depending on the severity of the loading spectrum. This is shown by the comparison between Ls ,4 and Ls\nfor the two load spectra as shown in figures 3 and 4. The probability of survival Ls\ncalculates the increasing risk of failure as the fatigue crack extends in the same way as\nLS,/-t but it also includes the effect of the variability in residual static strength.\nThe probability of survival Ls can be applied with equal validity to calculate the\nprobability of survival for structures with initial cracks as outlined in the section "Risk\nof Failure in Structures Initially Cracked." This has been done for example of the highstrength steel structure taken previously and the results for two cases of initial cracking\nare shown in figures 8 and 10 where it will be noted that, for an equivalent probability of\nsurvival, the fatigue life is greatly reduced by the presence of initial cracks. The shortcomings of the conventional methods of life calculation are more marked in this case,\nsince for all structures the whole of the service life involves the propagation of a fatigue\ncrack with continual exposure to the progressively increasing risk of static fracture due\nto fatigue.\n\n301\n\nPROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE FAILING LOAD\nCurves showing the probability distribution of the collapse load for static fracture\nby fatigue for the high-tensile steel structure are shown at a series of lives in figure 15.\nIn the early stages of the life when only small cracks are present the majority of the\nstructures that fail do so from occurrence of a high load in excess of the design limit\nload. At longer lives, however, when a large percentage of the fleet has developed more\nextensive fatigue cracks, failure tends to take place by the occurrence of the much more\nfrequent lower loads. The curves for the probability distribution of the failing load have\na well defined "knee" which marks the transition from failures of structures with low\nstatic strength properties (according to the Weibull distribution of relative strength which\nhas a lower limit at x = 0.82) to structures with low fatigue strength and hence larger\ncrack lengths at any given life.\nWith the corresponding curves in figure 11, for all structures with initial cracks of\na 0.010-inch depth, this knee does not occur. In this case, at any particular life, all\nstructures have substantial cracks and the extent of these is largely independent of the\nfatigue strength so that the probability distribution of static strength is the controlling\nfactor for all values of failing load.\nTHE EFFECT OF INSPECTION\nThe effect of inspection on the risk of failure and probability of survival for initially\nuncracked structures is shown in figures 12 and 13. Although it is not usually a feasible\nprocedure in practice, continuous inspection has an important basic significance which\nwarrants some consideration here.\nThe risk function for continuous inspection slowly approaches an upper limiting\nvalue when there is no repair and replacement of structures in which cracks are detected\n("inspection without replacement"). This situation arises because as the initial cracks\nare propagated by fatigue to the detectable length these structures are eliminated by\ninspection and a stage is therefore reached where the increase in risk due to the extension\nof fatigue cracks is offset by the continual removal from service of structures with\ndetectable cracks and high risk of failure.\nIn the more practical case where structures are repaired and returned to service\nafter detection of cracks ("inspection with replacement") the risk function goes through a\nmaximum value and then eventually approaches zero. The explanation of this behaviour\nappears to be that, as fatigue cracks extend, the number of cracked structures replaced by\nsound structures increases until a stage is reached where this counteracts and then\n\n302\n\noutweighs the increasing risk of static fracture by fatigue in the dwindling members of\nthe original fleet.\nWith this model therefore the original fleet is eventually replaced by new structures which are taken to be free of any fatigue weakness and the risk of fatigue failure\ndecreases to zero. If the service life were to be prolonged to this stage, however, other\nareas of the structure would become fatigue critical and their risk of failure would have\nto be considered.\nIn practice, cracked structures or components are often replaced by new members\nfrom the same population as the structures or components in the original fleet. This\nmodel of the fatigue process ("inspection with renewal") would show a behaviour intermediate between the two procedures considered above.\nThe risk functions for continuous inspection of structures with initial cracks are\npresented in figures 7 and 9 and these show a similar behaviour to that found with initially\nuncracked structures although for the case of a continuous distribution of initial crack\nsize in figure 9 the peak of the "inspection with replacement" curve is much flatter\nbecause of the wider range of crack sizes that results.\nTurning now to the practical case of periodic inspections designed to limit the risk\nof failure below a specified value rmax, it can be seen from figures 12, 7, and 9 that in\nall cases the risk of failure fluctuates between the risk for continuous inspection and the\nspecified maximum value rmax.\nFor inspection with replacement it can be seen that because of the peak in the curve\nfor the risk function with continuous inspection, the inspection intervals for limited risk\nat first decrease with each inspection and then increase.\nThis effect is clearly shown for the three cases considered by the inspection intervals given in table I which also lists the expected fraction of the fleet in which cracks will\nbe detected at each inspection.\nThe curves showing the corresponding survivorship functions for inspection with\nlimited risk are shown in figures 13, 8, and 10, and it is apparent that inspection for\nlimited risk can give a comparable performance to the ideal case of continuous inspection.\nAt the cost of decreasing the inspection intervals, the probability of survival can be\nincreased by reducing the maximum allowable risk rmax, although this must always\nexceed the maximum risk for continuous inspection for the inspection procedure with\nlimited risk to be possible.\n\n303\n\nAPPLICATION\nThe reliability approach to structural design has received increasing attention in\nrecent years and it is proposed here that the safety against fatigue of aircraft structures\nis one of the most important and promising fields of application.\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE RELIABILITY APPROACH TO FATIGUE\nEarly work on the probabilistic approach to fatigue of aircraft structures was\nmainly concerned with efforts to establish the fail-safe philosophy on a more quantitative\nbasis by considering the probability of failure of the structure during the crack propagation stage.\nOne of the first papers on this subject was concerned with the fail-safe operation of\ntransport aircraft (ref. 7), and a similar approach was used subsequently (refs. 8 and 9)\nin efforts to develop a proposal for ensuring the airworthiness of fail-safe structures.\nIn references 10 and 11 reliability analysis was applied to derive the probability of\nfailure for a fail-safe structure by using a sophisticated model to represent the effect of\nmultiple redundancies in the structure.\nProbably influenced by the successful application of reliability techniques to\nelectronic systems, the reliability approach to structural safety in general received\nincreasing attention and several papers dealing with the basic development of the philosophy (refs. 12 to 15) also dealt at some length with its application to the fatigue of\nstructures.\nThe reliability approach to structural design has received increasing attention more\nrecently and papers (some relating to the aspect of fatigue) have been represented at a\nnumber of International Conferences (refs. 16 to 24).\nHowever, a major difficulty in applying reliability theory to the fatigue of structures is the extensive amount of data required since this is not normally available. The\npresent paper seeks to overcome this difficulty by presenting an approach which allows\nrepresentative data to be used in conjunction with the full utilisation of the information\nwhich can be obtained from the full-scale tests now widely adopted in aircraft design\npractice.\nRELIABILITY ANALYSIS WITH FULL-SCALE TESTING\nThe method proposed in this paper calculates the probability of failure of a structure\nat each stage of the life with data obtained from full-scale tests on the actual structure in\nconjunction with other representative data. It therefore estimates the risk of failure in\n304\n\nthe fleet, and hence the probability of failure (or survival) up to any required life, taking\naccount of the flight loads to be encountered, the progressive reduction in strength due to\nthe growing fatigue crack, and the variability in static and fatigue strength.\nThe inspection or replacement of structures in service can then be planned to\nachieve a prescribed safety level using basic data from the fatigue test without requiring\nany arbitrary decision as to the crack length that constitutes failure or as to whether a\nstructure is "fail safe" or not.\n\nApplication of the Method\nWith the risk function having been calculated, the life n I to reach the allowable\nrisk rmax(nI) is determined as the life for inspection or replacement.\nFrom the physical nature of the failure as revealed by the fatigue test and the risk\nfunction for continuous inspection with the detectable crack length, a judgement can be\nmade whether to rely on inspection or on replacement.\nIf replacement is decided on all structures are replaced at nI and the process can\nbe repeated with the constant inspection interval n I until the probability of survival has\nbeen reduced to the minimum allowable value.\nIf inspection is adopted the inspection intervals are calculated as described in the\nsection "Inspection for Limited Risk" and the process is continued up to the life ns at\nwhich the probability of survival has been reduced to the minimum allowable value. The\nfraction of defective structures that can be expected to be revealed at each inspection\ncan be calculated from equation (39). Also the probability distribution of the failing load\ncan be calculated and used to estimate the average value of the failing load at the life for\nany inspection, from which an indication of the average crack length can be obtained.\nIt is clear from figures 13 and 10 that the safe operating life can be greatly extended\nby this type of inspection procedure and therefore as the service life continues other\nfatigue-prone areas of the structure revealed in the fatigue test may need to be included\nin the analysis in the same way.\nBasic Assumptions\nThe following basic assumptions are involved:\n(a) The service load S is independent of the failing load of the structure R. This\nassumption infers that any increase in flexibility of the structure as a fatigue crack\nextends does not affect its response to the applied loads.\n(b) There is no correlation between the residual strength of a cracked structure and\nits fatigue strength. This is supported by the fact that in a complex structure static\n305\n\nultimate load failure usually occurs in a different area and by a different mechanism to\nfatigue failure.\n(c) The relative residual strength x = Rw of structures cracked to some crack\nAM\n\nlength l has a characteristic probability distribution which applies for any value of Z.\nFor the monolithic structure considered in the section on page 289, the fracture mechanics relationship R(1) = K Fis assumed to apply. It can be shown from this that R(1)\nhas the same probability distribution as the fracture toughness K and it is therefore\nthe same for all crack lengths.\n(d) The distribution of fatigue life N l\'z at a given crack length 1 has a log\nnormal distribution. The log normal distribution is often used in making safe-life estimates and it has been supported as a good approximation by comprehensive surveys of\nfatigue test data (refs. 25 and 26).\n(e) At all points on the crack propagation curve of any structure, the fatigue life\nNZ z bears a constant ratio to the median life NZ at the same crack length -1 = z\nNZ\n\n\'\t\n\nIt can be shown that this follows from the properties of the log normal distribution of\nfatigue life assumed in assumption (d).\n(f) As structures fail by fatigue and are thus eliminated from the population there\nis no change in shape of the probability density functions of fatigue life z, relative\nstrength x, or initial crack length 1c. In practice some distortion of these functions\nwill occur but for the small probabilities of failure considered it is regarded as a reasonable assumption.\nInput Data\nThe following data are required:\n(a) The service load spectrum Fs(s) which can usually be estimated from the\nconsiderable body of flight load data available.\n(b) The mean value of the ultimate failing load \xc2\xb5o which can usually be obtained\nfrom the results of static strength tests on the structure.\n(c) The probability distribution of relative strength x = R(^) which must be estiA R(1)\nfrom representative data (as was done for the case of the high-strength steel\nstructure by using data from high-tensile steel specimens) and the results from component testing during the design stage.\n\n306\n\n(d) The median crack propagation curve for the structure Z n = g(nl); it is proposed\nto rely on the crack propagation curve obtained in the full-scale fatigue test of the\nstructure.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nFrom a reliability analysis of the fatigue failure in aircraft structures under service loading conditions it is concluded that the current procedures for obtaining safety\nare not entirely adequate. These methods do not take full account of the probability of\nfailure of the structure during the period in which it is being progressively weakened by\nthe growing fatigue crack and they are therefore subject to inaccuracies which may be\nsignificant depending on the structural design parameters and the service conditions.\nIt is also concluded that a reliability approach to the safety in fatigue of aircraft\nstructures must be considered, using the results available from the structural tests and\ndesign analysis in conjunction with other representative data.\nSuch an approach is quite feasible although an extensive body of data and a number\nof assumptions are involved which warrant some development and testing of the procedure\nin practice.\nHowever, the reliability approach has major potential advantages by enabling the\nsafety of both safe-life and fail-safe structures to be determined on a quantitative basis,\nincluding the planning of efficient inspection procedures and allowance for the possibility\nof initial flaws in the material where appropriate.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors wish to acknowledge the efforts of their colleagues in Structures\nDivision of Aeronautical Research Laboratories who have assisted with the preparation of\nmaterial for this paper.\n\n307\n\nAPPRNTITX\n\nTABULATION OF RISKS OF FAILURE AND\nPROBABILITY OF CRACK DETECTION\nFor simplicity the risk functions in the body of the paper have been expressed in\nterms of the dimensionless variate z and they have been compared on a common basis\nin the various figures using the dimensionless variate Ns/Ni . However, in this appendix\nthey are expressed in a form more suitable for practical application, the risk of failure\nper hour using the relation:\nr(Ns) dNs = r(z) dz\nr(Ns) = r(z) ddz\n\ns\n\nwhere Ns is the service life in hours.\nIf the risk of failure were to be required in units other than hours \xe2\x80\x94 such as load\napplications, for example \xe2\x80\x94 the dimensional variable N s (or for cracked structures Hs)\nwould have to be expressed in those units.\nThe footnotes for this appendix are included at the end of the appendix.\nSTRUCTURES WITH NO INITIAL CRACKS\nNo Inspection\nRisk with safe-life analysis.- Risk of failure per hour at Ns hours, based on an\nestimated mean life R L determined from a fatigue test as the life to some crack\nlength L at which failure occurred, is given by\nrL(Ns)\n\nNL pz C nL J\n\n(Al)\n\n_ p, (z) ^\nc"\nns^nL\n\nwhere NL is the estimated mean life to the crack length L expressed in hours.\nRisk of fatigue fracture a .-\n\nNs hours can be given by\n\n308\n\nRisk of failure per hour by fatigue fracture at a life of\n\npz\nNF\n\nr F(Ns) _ 00\n\n\\nF^\npz (z) dz\n\n^ns/^^F\nwhere N F is the median of the life in hours to complete collapse under the mean load.\nRisk of static fracture due to fatigue. - Risk of failure per hour by static fracture\n\ndue to fatigue at a life of N s hours is given by\nX-00\n\nn\t\n\n1\n\n(A3)\n\nsFs{x\xc2\xb5o^(g[zs-P(z)p(x) dz dx\n\nr s( N s) = S\t\n\nx=0 Zns/ffF\n\nwhere Fs (s) denotes here the probability of exceeding a service load s per hour of\noperation b.\nProbabilitv distribution of the failin g load.

Salkind\n\nSikorsky Aircraft Division, United Aircraft Corporation, United States\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the past decade, the extensive development activity in composite structures has indicated the promise of substantial improvements in the performance of\naerospace systems. This experience, however, has shown that composite materials\nare substantially different from our former materials of construction, and new concepts in analysis, design, fabrication, quality assurance, and even systems management will be necessary.\nA major difference between composites and metals exists in their respective\nbehavior in a fatigue environment. Whereas metals usually fail by crack initiation\nand growth in a manner which has come to be predictable through fracture mechanics\nanalysis, composites exhibit several modes of damage including delamination, matrix\ncrazing, fiber failure, void growth, matrix cracking, and composite cracking. A particular structure may exhibit any or all these damage modes, and it is difficult to predict, a priori, which mode will dominate and cause failure. The selection of fiber and\nmatrix can produce predictable fiber or matrix-dominated failure in simple unidirectional specimens. (See refs. 1 to 4.) In real structures, however, the complex multidirectional loadings and complex reaction of nonsimple laminates precludes easy\nprediction of failure modes. Also, joints and attachments in composite structures\ngenerally result in failure modes which are peculiar to a particular design.\nA characteristic of composite materials which differs substantially from metals\nis the relative difference between low- and high-cycle fatigue behavior. Whereas most\nmetals behave according to the so-called Coffin-Manson relationship (refs. 5 to 7) in\nlow-cycle fatigue, composites have been shown to be more sensitive to strain range\n(ref. 4). This sensitivity results in the high-cycle fatigue strength of composites\nbeing high with respect to static- and low-cycle fatigue strength. Many structures\ndesigned for fatigue experience a spectrum of high as well as low stresses, and\nwhereas the more numerous low stresses may be the critical design factor for a\nmetal structure, the same structure made from a composite material may well be\ncritical in low-cycle fatigue.\nA problem arises in the design of composite structures for fatigue loading\nbecause of the lack of an adequate definition of failure. A large part of the fatigue\n*Also published in ASTM STP 497.\n333\n\ndata in the literature is based on time to fracture. For high-cycle fatigue, metals are\ngenerally structurally adequate to the point of crack initiation (and to some extent beyond\nthat), which is usually a large part of the time to fracture. Although it is preferable to\nuse fatigue data based on crack initiation, the error introduced by designing metal structures using fatigue data based on fracture is usually not significant. Using such an\napproximation for composites, however, could lead to disastrous results. Composites\ngenerally begin to exhibit changes in properties very early in the total life to fracture.\nSuch changes in elastic properties could lead to structural failure long before the structure is in danger of fracturing. Rotating airfoils such as helicopter rotor blades or gas\nturbine blades are subject to aeroelastic instabilities if the fundamental frequency shifts\nbecause of early fatigue damage that causes stiffness changes. A composite spring whose\nspring constant changes beyond an acceptable value would be considered failed even\nthough it was in no danger of fracturing. The same composite used for a tension cable\napplication for which stiffness is not critical might have an acceptable fatigue life to failure several orders of magnitude higher than the stiffness critical spring under the same\nloading conditions. A further complication to this problem is the fact that composites\nare anisotropic, and for any number of cycles, the change in stiffness in one direction\nmay be unrelated to the change in stiffness in a second direction.\nThe requirement for an adequate failure criterion, coupled with the challenge of\nproviding adequate damage detection schemes for multiple damage modes, clearly indicates the requirement for a new approach to the design of fatigue-critical composite\nstructures. This paper includes a review of the fatigue behavior of composite materials\nand structures and a proposed approach for design of fatigue-critical components.\nFATIGUE OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS\nA large body of small specimen fatigue data has been generated over the past\n10 years. These data are primarily for unidirectional laminates and, as mentioned previously, are based upon fracture as the definition of failure. Hence, much of it is of\nlimited value for use in design. A survey of pertinent observations is included in this\nsection.\nFiber-Reinforced Polymers\nThe most widely used class of composite materials, glass-fiber-reinforced polymers, has been the subject of extensive fatigue testing (refs. 8 to 23). Although the data\nin references 8 to 23 are based upon fracture as the failure criterion, they give us an\nindication of the effect of significant variables, such as resin composition and content\nand fiber composition and orientation on fatigue. Boller (ref. 11) has evaluated a variety\n334\n\nof matrix systems and found epoxides to be superior in fatigue. His data, seen in figure 1, is more than 15 years old, and improved surface treatments and processing have\nsince been developed; however, the relative ranking remains unchanged (ref. 19). As\nseen in figure 2, varying the resin content between 20 and 37 percent has a negligible effect\non fatigue behavior for t5 0 glass-fiber composites. The effect of fiber orientation is\nrather complex. Although the tensile strength of unidirectional composites is a maximum\nat 00 to the fibers (ref. 24), in fatigue the unidirectional construction is not optimum, as\ncan be seen in figure 3. The best explanation for this phenomenon is the fact that unidirectional material is subject to splitting and rapid crack propagation in the matrix parallel\nto the fibers. Fatigue data for t5\xc2\xb0, 677, 00/337,90 0 , and Style 181 satin weave (00/900)\nare compared in figure 4. In general, nonwoven materials are superior to woven materials in fatigue. Note also the low notch sensitivity of these materials. A comparison\nof the behavior of S-glass and E-glass composites (ref. 15) is seen in figure 5. The\nhigher modulus S-glass is consistently stronger in fatigue than E-glass. The effect of\nmean stress is seen in figure 6 for tension-compression and tension-tension behavior.\nThere have also been some measurements of the compression-compression fatigue\nbehavior in low-cycle fatigue (ref. 20). These data indicate that the effect of mean stress\nis similar to that for metals, that is, the Goodman diagram is approximately linear.\nIn recent years, the realization that fracture was not an adequate design criterion\nfor failure has led to studies of failure mechanisms in fatigue which provide a foundation\nfor design. Broutman (ref. 25) studied the mechanisms of failure in glass-fiberreinforced polymers subjected to fatigue loading. He noted cracks originating at fibermatrix debonds propagating through the matrix and being deflected by fibers. Recent\nstudies (refs. 26 to 30) have quantitatively described the changes in elastic and strength\nproperties associated with this type of damage. Smith and Owen (ref. 26) evaluated eleven\ndifferent composite systems with modulus values ranging from 0.5 X 10 6 to 6.5 X 106 psi\nand found that the initial damage debonding occurred at 0.3% strain as seen in figure 7.\nThus, the limiting factor in fatigue is not the fiber but the interface or the matrix. As\ndescribed in the following section, studies with metal matrix composites confirm this\nbehavior. The data seen in figure 8 for chopped-strand mat-reinforced polyester laminates confirm that initial damage occurs at stresses well below those required for fracture. The effect of such damage on structural capability will determine whether the part\nhas failed. Based on the observation of a critical strain, Smith and Owen postulated a\ncritical maximum stress independent of mean stress for any material. As seen in figure 9, this postulation was found to be incorrect (ref. 26).\nCessna et al. (ref. 27) performed constant-deflection flexural fatigue tests on glassreinforced polypropylene and monitored the load decay (proportional to modulus decay)\nwith cycles as seen in figure 10. They also monitored the temperature rise, as seen in\n335\n\nfigure 10, due to viscoelastic energy dissipation, which is common for polymeric composites. (See refs. 31 to 37.) In addition to indicating progressive fatigue damage, the\ntemperature rise also contributes to weakening the material and shortening its fatigue\nlife. As seen in figure 11, by cooling their specimens to maintain isothermal conditions,\nCessna et al. (ref. 27) were able to extend both the cycles to onset of stiffness change and\nthe fracture life by an order of magnitude.\nBroutman and Sahu (ref. 28) have related the changes in residual tensile strength\nand modulus to the development of cracks in 0 0/900 crossplied material as seen in figure 12. Although the decrease in residual strength and primary modulus is expected\nbecause of the increasing crack density, the initial increase in secondary modulus\nremains unexplained. A quantitative relationship between modulus change and crack density (fig. 13) has been developed on the same material. Fujii and Mizukawa (ref. 30) have\nalso determined the change in elastic and strength properties with cycling for laminates\nconsisting of several combinations of roving cloth, chopped mat, and woven cloth.\nThe higher modulus composite materials, graphite and boron, have exhibited higher\nfatigue strengths than glass-reinforced polymers, as seen in figure 14 (refs. 15, 38\nto 41). This difference is primarily attributed to the higher modulus resulting in less\nstrain in the matrix and interface at the same cyclic stress level. The phenomenon of\nlow fatigue strength at zero mean stress for the high modulus composites as seen in figure 14 was first noted for boron-reinforced aluminum. It is thought to be the result of\nlow transverse strength of unidirectional composites resulting in splitting under cyclic\ncompressive loads. This behavior severely limits the use of unidirectional composites\nas discussed above.\nA major variable which can affect the data obtained in a composite fatigue test is\nthe specimen geometry. This variable is very much a function of the particular laminate\norientation being tested, as interlaminar shear can be a primary controlling factor\n(refs. 42 and 43). Although this problem is negligible for a unidirectional material, it\nbecomes a major factor in fatigue testing of \xc2\xb145 0 laminates. Figure 15 compares the\naxial tension-tension fatigue behavior (based on fracture) for \xc2\xb145 0 1002 E-glass composites for three different specimen configurations (ref. 43). The straight-sided specimen\nis flat, and each fiber terminates at the edge, thus, high interlaminar shear stresses are\ncreated. The x-type specimen has all fibers continuous from grip to grip; thus, interlaminar shear stresses at the edge are precluded. The latter type has the disadvantage\nof having a vanishingly small gage length and very uniformly loaded fibers, which are not\nrepresentative of the types of loading experienced in most structures; thus, the resultant\ndata are considered to be too optimistic for design. The tubular specimen has a uniformly loaded gage section and no fiber edges; thus, interlaminar shear is precluded. It\nis felt that such a specimen comes closest to yielding representative material properties\n336\n\nfor design. Edges are usually handled as a separate factor in design. Although the difference between the straight-sided and tubular specimens is only 5% for glass, it is\napproximately 50% for boron, as can be seen in figure 16. The reason for this effect is\nthat the interlaminar shear stresses are higher for high modulus materials.\nFiber-Reinforced Metals\nAlthough fiber-reinforced metals considerably lag reinforced polymers in terms of\ndevelopment and usage, some of the earliest and best fundamental studies of fatigue have\nbeen accomplished with metal matrix composites. Forsyth, George, and Ryder (ref. 1)\ndemonstrated that the inclusion of steel wires in an aluminum-alloy sheet reduces the\nrate of crack propagation substantially (fig. 17), although the improvement in total fatigue\nlife to fracture is small (fig. 18). Baker and Cratchley (refs. 2, 44 to 48) performed\nextensive studies of the fatigue behavior of silica- and steel-fiber-reinforced aluminum\nalloys. Although silica-reinforced aluminum did not show promise as a fatigue-resistant\nmaterial, Baker and Cratchley made important observations concerning failure modes\nand anelastic behavior. They identified the crack-diverting capability of strong fibers\n(ref. 2) and made important observations concerning the stress-strain behavior and\ndamping capability of composites as seen in figure 19 (ref. 44). In addition, Baker quantitatively defined the effect of fiber length on fatigue behavior (ref. 46) and evaluated the\neffects of fiber fatigue behavior and the interface (ref. 47).\nExtensive studies have been made of the fatigue behavior of composites made by\nunidirectional solidification of eutectic alloys (refs. 4, 49 to 52). Because these composites have very regularly distributed fibers and well-bonded interfaces, they serve as\nexcellent systems for studying the mechanical behavior of composites without the variable\nfabrication effects common to other composites. The Al-A1 3Ni (10% reinforcing A13Ni\nwhiskers) and the Al-CuAl 2 (50% reinforcing CuAl 2 platelets) composite materials\nexhibit markedly different fatigue behavior as seen in figure 20. A comparison of the\nstress-strain behavior of the two materials showing fatigue failure at the same stress\namplitude (ref. 49) reveals that Al-CuAl2 appears to work-harden more rapidly with\nnarrower hysteresis loops than Al-A1 3Ni. It can be speculated that the wide CuAl2\nplatelets are more effective at blocking plastic flow than the A1 3Ni whiskers (which have\na spacing at least an order of magnitude too large for optimum dispersion hardening). In\naddition, the greater volume fraction of CuAl 2 is more effective at blocking plastic flow\nin the matrix. If matrix strain is the controlling factor, then the behavior seen in figure 20 would be an expected consequence of the difference in stress-strain behavior.\nThe fatigue behavior of metals has been found to obey a simple empirical relationship (refs. 5 to 7, 53 and 54)\n\n337\n\nAEr\n\n= MNz\n\n+E\n\nNy\n\n\t\n\n(1)\n\nPlastic Elastic\nwhere\nAE\n\nT\t\n\ntotal cyclic strain range\n\nE\t\n\nelastic modulus\n\nN\t\n\nnumber of cycles to failure\n\nM, G, z, y\t\n\nmaterial constants\n\nThis relationship is depicted schematically in figure 21, and it is seen that the plastic\ncomponent (first term of eq. (1)) dominates at low cycles (high strain amplitudes), and\nthe elastic component dominates at high cycles. Although most metals exhibit values of\nz of -0.5 to -0.6 (refs. 53 and 54), Al 3Ni whisker-reinforced aluminum exhibits much\nlower values as seen in figure 22. It has been proposed (ref. 4) that the low-cycle fatigue\nbehavior is not governed entirely by the plastic behavior of the aluminum (z = -0.5) but\nalso by the elastic behavior of the A1 3Ni (y < -0.1). This type of behavior would be\nexpected for most composites having fibers which behave elastically in the stress range\nof use (glass, boron, graphite, highly cold-worked steel) and accounts for the relatively\nflat S-N (that is, stress S \xe2\x80\x94 number of cycles to failure N) curves discussed in the\nIntroduction.\nAs seen in figure 23, the flexural fatigue behavior of Al-Al 3Ni is substantially\nhigher than that for the matrix alone. The mode of failure is matrix cracking, the fibers\nserving to reduce matrix strain. Testing in a protective atmosphere such as argon\nresults in higher fatigue strength as seen in figure 24, which further verifies the fact that\nfailure is matrix dominated. Although the aluminum is susceptible to attack by moisture\nin the atmosphere, the A1 3Ni whiskers are not.\nThe fatigue behavior of boron-reinforced aluminum has been extensively studied\n(refs. 55 to 59). The very high modulus of the reinforcing fiber keeps the matrix strain\nlow for any given stress level. This factor, coupled with the excellent fatigue resistance\nof boron fiber itself (ref. 60), provides extremely good fatigue resistance as seen in figure 25. The data by Young and Carlson (ref. 56) is particularly valuable as it records\nchanges in deflection for torsion, tension, and combined-load fatigue testing.\nGates and Wood (ref. 61) performed detailed studies of the microstructural changes\nwhich accompanied the torsional fatigue testing of copper reinforced circumferentially by\n338\n\ntungsten or molybdenum wire. They noted that work hardening followed by crack initiation occurred in the matrix between fibers.\nFATIGUE OF COMPOSITE STRUCTURES\nIn order to define a design base for structures, it is necessary to determine the\nfull-scale fatigue behavior of composite materials to identify the effects of size, manufacturing variation, and combined loads. A limited amount of experience now exists with\nfull-scale components (refs. 62 and 63); however, much of it relates to specific geometries and constructions and few generalizations may be drawn. Two things which are\nclear from this experience is the fact that composite structures are very fatigue resistant in aerospace applications relative to metal structures, and joints and attachments\nremain a major design problem, especially in fatigue.\nThe most substantial body of structural fatigue data exists for helicopter rotor\nblades (refs. 62 and 63). Jarosch and Stepan (ref. 62) have done fatigue testing of root\nend and outboard sections of the BO-105 fiberglass/epoxy rotor blade. The blade construction, seen in figure 26, consists of a C-spar of unidirectional E -glass -reinforced\nepoxy wound around a pin fitting at the root end, a skin of woven-glass cloth/epoxy\noriented at \xc2\xb145\xc2\xb0, and a foam core. Measured values of the spar and skin elastic modulus\nin the spanwise direction were 6.0 x 10 6 and 2.6 x 106 psi, respectively. The root end\nwas fatigue tested, as seen in figure 27, with equal flapping and lagging loads of\n1900 \xc2\xb1 2600 ft-lb and a steady centrifugal load of 24 000 lb. Fatigue lives varied to\n13 x 10 6 cycles. Failure generally occurred in the unidirectional roving at the root-end\npin attachment and was accompanied by considerable heating due to interlaminar friction.\nReadily visible delamination and gradual changes in stiffness and damping also occurred.\nOutboard specimens were tested in flapping resonance at a fatigue strain level of \xc2\xb10.870,\nwhich is ten times the maximum strain in flight. Typical fatigue lives were more than\n106 cycles, and failure was preceded by obvious visible delaminations and accompanying\nchanges in damping and stiffness.\nFatigue tests of boron/epoxy and glass/epoxy CH-47 rotor blades (ref. 63) have\nalso indicated excellent fatigue resistance although failures occurred in the metal rootend fitting. Similarly, fatigue testing of the boron/epoxy F-111 horizontal tail resulted\nin failure associated with the attachment of the composite to the titanium root end.\nSpectrum testing of components of a boron/epoxy wing box has shown excellent fatigue\nresistance, as has sonic fatigue testing of a boron/epoxy C-5A slat component. Both of\nthese items have exhibited failure in fittings of composite bonded to metal.\n\n339\n\nCOMPOSITE FATIGUE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nA successful design procedure for composite materials in fatigue applications will\nnot be a simple extrapolation of procedures used for metals. Metal parts exhibit cracks\nwhen they begin to fail in fatigue, and the cracks generally propagate in a predictable\nmanner to failure. Thus, the metal part may be inspected at specific intervals and\nremoved from service prior to failure. Composites, on the other hand, do not fail in the\nsame manner.\nThe difference between fatigue behavior of a composite and that of a metal structure\nis depicted schematically in figure 28. The primary mode of damage in a metal structure is cracking. Cracks propagate in a relatively well defined manner with respect to\nthe applied stress, and the critical crack size and rate of crack propagation can be related\nto specimen data through analytical fracture mechanics. In this discussion, the critical\ndamage size is defined as that amount of damage at which the composite will be no longer\nstructurally adequate. In general, the crack initiation time (defined as the time to detecable cracking (inspection threshold)) occupies a large part of the fatigue life of a metal\npart (ref. 64). It should be noted that all structures have some initial damage in the form\nof microcracks, surface imperfections, inclusions, and other stress risers and that much\nof the so-called crack initiation time involves propagation of this damage to detectable\nsize. With composite structures there is no single damage mode which dominates.\nMatrix cracking, delamination, debonding, voids, fiber fracture, and composite cracking\ncan all occur separately and in combination, and the predominance of one or more is\nhighly dependent on the laminate orientations and loading conditions. In addition, the\nunique joints and attachments used for composite structures often introduce modes of\nfailure different from those typified by the laminate itself.\nThe composite damage propagates in a less regular manner and damage modes can\nchange. (See fig. 28.) Present experience with composites, although limited, indicates\nthat the rate of damage propagation in composites does not exhibit the two distinct regions\nof initiation and propagation. Although, as mentioned previously, the crack initiation\nrange in metals is actually propagation, there is a significant quantitative difference in\nrate. This quantitative difference appears to be less apparent with composites. This\nobservation is very subjective and apparently dependent upon the observer\'s definition of\ninitiation. Some investigators have observed matrix crazing and other indications early\nin their tests but have reported short-time rapid propagation because they define the\nlatter based upon their experience with metals as crack propagation. Indeed, composite\ncracking may occupy only a small part of the fatigue life at the very end, but we can certainly snake use of all the earlier indications which are prevalent.\n\n340\n\nIt is expected that composite materials will be more damage tolerant than metals.\nAgain, this expectation is based upon limited experience and will depend upon the laminate orientation (unidirectional composites are subject to splitting) and loading conditions,\nbut, in general, it can be argued that each fiber is a separate load path and that a composite is therefore highly redundant. Our present analytical fracture mechanics tool\nmust be supplemented for use with composites before we have a better understanding of\nthis behavior. Several investigators have indicated that, in general, composites exhibit\ngood fracture toughness (refs. 65 to 67) and, unlike metals, increase fracture toughness\nwith increasing strength. It is thus reasonable to predict the critical damage size in\ncomposites to be greater than that for metals (fig. 28), although the multiple failure modes\nmake this value a band for composites. Similarly, the inspection threshold is depicted\nas a band in figure 28 because there are multiple failure modes and multiple inspection\nmethods\nThe problem then is to determine the critical mode or modes of failure and develop\ndetection schemes in order to insure fail safety in critical components. One such procedure involves the determination of changes in the static or dynamic stiffness properties\nof the component. A change in the resonant frequency or damping behavior of a part is\nan indication of damage. Failure criteria can be developed from data such as those seen\nin figures 10 to 12 as substantial changes occur early enough in the fatigue life to allow\nsafe detection and removal from service. This characteristic may provide excellent fail\nsafety for rotor blades in that the aeroelastic behavior may degrade noticeably long\nbefore the part has sustained damage of critical size. Other detection schemes such as\ntemperature rise measurements (fig. 10), embedded conducting wires, radiography,\nsonics, ultrasonics, holography, infrared inspection, dye penetrant, and visual inspection\nwill probably be used separately or in conjunction with dynamic measurements.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major consideration for developing a valid design methodology is a definition of failure. A problem exists however, in that a single failure criterion may be inadequate for all applications. This situation is seen schematically in figure 29. The example considers two structures, a spring and a tension cable, and two\ncandidate materials, a metal and a composite, for each application. The failure criterion\nfor the spring is a specified loss in stiffness, whereas that for the cable is fracture.\nSince metal structures exhibit little change in stiffness until cracking is extensive, the\nmetal spring and metal cable have approximately the same life, and a single criterion\nbased on fracture is probably adequate for design. The composite material spring would\nlose sufficient stiffness to be considered failed at only a fraction of its fracture life,\nwhereas, the tension cable made of the same material and subject to the same loading\nwould have a much greater useful life. In order to provide for such design considerations,\nit will be desirable to record fatigue data as depicted schematically in figure 30.\n341\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nComposite materials appear to offer excellent resistance to fatigue loading and,\nas such, will likely find use in dynamic components. A second factor which makes composites attractive for these applications is the opportunity for tailoring of the stiffness\nin different directions, thus the designer is given the capability of tuning dynamic components. As composites find wider application, it will be necessary to provide more\nprecise definitions of failure and to couple these definitions with proper damage detection\nschemes. New, sophisticated damage detection methods will probably not be necessary;\nhowever, because of the multiple damage modes possible, it will be necessary to utilize\nmultiple detection schemes. The apparent high damage tolerance of composites will\nallow somewhat relaxed inspection requirements and will provide for improved repairability procedures. At this writing, the cost of high modulus composites is still high and\nmust be further reduced to allow wider usage.\n\n342\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Forsyth, P. J. E.; George, R. W.; and Ryder, D.

Doty\nThe Boeing Company, Seattle , Washington, U.S.A.\nSUMMARY\nFor supersonic airline operations, significantly higher environmental temperature\nis the primary new factor affecting structural service life. Methods for incorporating\nthe influence of temperature in detailed fatigue analyses are shown along with current\ntest indications. Thermal effects investigated include real-time compared with shorttime testing, long-time temperature exposure, and stress -temperature cycle phasing.\nA method which allows deSigners and stress analyzers to check fatigue resistance\nof structural design details is the primary theme of this paper. A more communicative\nrating system is presented which defines the relative fatigue quality of the detail so that\nthe analyst can define cyclic-load capability of the design detail by entering constant-life\ncharts for varying detail quality. If necessary then, this system allows him to determine\nways to improve the fatigue quality for better life or to determine the operating stresses\nwhich will provide the required service life.\nA supersonic vehicle structure , which is subject to major airload center-of pressure shifts as well as to the addition of thermal-gradient stresses to mechanical\nstresses, experiences a relatively large percentage of damage from ground-air-ground\n(GAG) cycles. In studying the Ig thermal-gradient history of a design detail , the analyst\nwill produce a Ig stress history. Application of simple factors to this history allows\ndetermination of dynamically instantaneous maximum and minimum stresses statistically\nrealized once per flight which represent the GAG cycle. The relationship of GAG damage to total damage on various parts of the vehicle is used to facilitate a quick fatigueresistance check.\nA quick fatigue- check method for deSigners and stress analysts benefits the design\nby making designers and stress analysts more cognizant of fatigue problems throughout\nthe detail design phase of an aircraft development.\nTHE PROTOTYPE TASK\nAt the 1967 ICAF meeting in Melbourne, Australia, the philosophy and scope of an\nintegrated program of analysis, development testing, and verification testing for the\nAmerican supersonic transport (SST) were presented. Since that time the program has\ndeveloped to the point where the prototype configuration is being designed and fabricated.\nFigure 1 shows the SST in take-off and cruise configuration and figure 2 gives an idea of\n\n365\n\nthe structural configuration. Attention to fatigue and fail-safe requirements in the detail\ndesign of the prototype will assure a structure representative of the 50 000 flight hour\nand 20-year service life design goal for a production SST.\nIf a total SST program schedule is reviewed, the significant location of the prototype job becomes apparent. Figure 3 presents the essential schedule elements. A 30to 40-year time span is needed to include a 20-year operating period. The prototype\ndesign release, which is labeled NOW on figure, comes fairly early in the program after\na company study period, a research and competition period, and a prototype design development period. Careful planning and implementation of investigation programs with\nextensive testing will provide the required structural confidence for the production design.\nFor the prototype, fatigue resistance representative of production design must be engineered into the structure with a strictly fundamental analysis without a great depth of\ntitanium structural component tests. This paper presents the basic tools used along\nwith discussion of the significant factors affecting fatigue and how they are accounted\nfor in the prototype design.\nGood fatigue design is most effectively accomplished when both designers and design\nanalysts understand and implement fatigue requirements in the drawing release process.\nDesign analysts on the SST prototype are required to check their designs for production\nrequirements specifying 50 000 flight hours of normal usage. The projected composite\nairplane usage includes 49 250 hours of revenue service used in 22 000 flights and\n750 hours of training containing 1500 full-stop landings and 2600 touch-and-go landings.\nApplication of these service life requirements in addition to other loads criteria truly\nmakes the prototype design an exercise in production design.\nThe fatigue analysis procedure, made available to the design analyst in handbook\nform, allows him to determine the service life capability quickly. A rating system which\ngives the relative fatigue quality of a design detail so that the analyst can determine\ncyclic-load capability by entering constant-life charts for varying detail quality is presented. Consequently, he can determine whether to improve quality for known life\nimprovement or to establish operating stress levels which will provide satisfactory\nservice life. With a minimum of experience with different details, an engineering understanding of relative fatigue values is developed.\nTHE SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT FATIGUE PROBLEM\nIn the transition from subsonic to supersonic transport operations, the major new\nparameter influencing structural fatigue resistance is elevated-temperature exposure.\nThere are many other more subtle influences in this operational transition, but the\nthermal environment necessitates development of new tools for fatigue-performance\nevaluations.\n366\n\nFigure 4 shows schematically a comparison of equidistant subsonic and supersonic\ntransport operations. The supersonic mission is clearly a high-speed high-altitude type\nof operation with a lower percent of time spent in cruise operation. High-altitude operation puts the SST in a less damaging gust environment during cruise. Also, because the\nSST must be designed for efficient high-speed supersonic cruise, the effects of relatively\nlarge center-of-pressure shifts between the subsonic and supersonic operation are apparent on this type of vehicle. When the relative parts of the damage resulting from gust,\nmaneuver, taxi, take-off, landing, and ground-air-ground (GAG) operation are considered,\nit is apparent that a large part of fatigue damage will be due to the GAG cycle on critical\nparts of the primary wing and body structure. This conclusion is used to advantage in\ndeveloping a simple fatigue-check procedure.\nThe subsonic operation produces no significant thermal environment but supersonic\noperation at Mach 2.7 subjects the airplane to a stagnation temperature of 500 0 F. Figure 5 shows the stabilized temperatures existing during cruise. Realizing that the mission requires climb and acceleration into and finally descent and deceleration from such\na condition, the design analyst knows that fatigue analysis must account for many thermal\neffects. For convenience in the development of analytical procedures, the total thermal\neffect will be evaluated as thermal-gradient loading, long-time temperature exposure,\nand an interrelated cyclic exposure of stress and temperature.\nAfter analysis of projected operational SST route structures, a mean mission was\nselected to establish representative fatigue damage for the SST prototype structural\ndesign. Figure 6 shows the details of this mission. The consequences of this operation\non a structural detail are illustrated in figures 7 to 9. Figure 7 shows a typical 1g stress\nand external temperature history at a wing lower surface location. Figure 8 shows the\nthermal-gradient stress and temperature history as it will develop on two types of typical\nwing surface structures. Figure 9 shows a combined total stress and temperature history for the structural detail being analyzed. The design analyst studying the load and\ntemperature effects on any structural detail will prepare these histories to understand\nhis problem. These histories provide him with the initial tool leading into the fatiguecheck procedure.\nThe first step in the analysis procedure is to define the stress level of a primary\nGAG cycle from the data obtained in producing figure 9. It is not the intent of this report\nto discuss in detail the criteria loadings for gust, maneuver, taxi, take-off, and landing.\nHowever, with a clear definition of a GAG cycle, a statistical factor can be determined to\napply to the maximum and minimum stresses of figure 9 to establish dynamically instantaneous maximum and minimum stresses that are realized 1000 times in 1000 flights.\nThese factors, indicated in figure 9, are used by the design analyst to establish the stress\nlimits of a primary GAG cycle.\n367\n\nFrom the general aspect of fatigue analysis the analyst now has viewed the effects\nof the thermal cycle associated with supersonic flight and has established the GAG\nstresses for his design detail. It is now important to again realize that temperature is\nthe primary new factor affecting fatigue and that the balance of the factors affecting\nfatigue are handled in the same manner as those on subsonic transports. Consideration\nof the primary factors affecting service life will point out how they are evaluated and how\nthe effect of the thermal cylce is included in the analysis.\nFACTORS AFFECTING SERVICE LIFE\nBased on broad scope categories, the primary factors influencing service life of an\noperational vehicle are\n(1) Selection of structural material\n(2) Type of design and fabrication\n(3) Service reliability\n(4) Operational environment\nEach of these categories is handled in a particular manner to facilitate the application of\na fatigue-check procedure at the point of drawing release.\nAll factors associated with the SST mission, service life, and vehicle production are\nconsidered in selecting the structural material. Annealed Ti-6A1-4V was selected as the\nprimary structural material because good fracture and fatigue properties are combined\nwith a good strength-weight ratio, particularly in the SST operating environment. Highstrength steels, as applicable, augment the primary structural material. For analysis\npurposes, after the selection decision, the material is represented by S-N curves for\nvarying quality of structure. In addition, when considering service reliability, the level\nof backup test and service knowledge for the material and type of detail application influence the selection of reliability factors.\nType of design and fabrication with its many facets is controlled in this procedure\nby establishing a detail fatigue rating (DFR) number. Effectively, the DFR of a design\nwill direct the analyst to the correct quality of S-N data for determining the service\nlife. Surface finish, fabrication techniques, geometric design details, fastener installations, and design assembly patterns are typical influencing factors determined by the\ntype of design and fabrication. Based on test data and service experience, DFR values\nare determined with formulas or established in charts.\nService reliability must account for the variability of fleet statistics, loading environment, test representation, and structural material properties. In a well defined\nloading environment on a fail-safe design detail with good test and service background,\n368\n\nthe analyst can consider going as low as 2.0 for a fatigue reliability factor (FRF) to be\napplied to specified life for analytical life requirements. As background data becomes\nminimum in the design of a good fail-safe structure, FRF values of 4 to 6 are required.\nIn cases where fail-safe design is difficult or impossible, safe-life design must be developed with FRF values twice those that would be required for fail-safe design. For the\nanalysis procedure, FRY values are specified in general terms and the design analyst\nconsults with fatigue specialists if further refinement is necessary.\nThe operational environment is usually well defined at the current state of development of specifications and investigation studies. Gust, maneuver, taxi, take-off and landing criteria for the SST are very much like that required for subsonic vehicles with fairly\nwell defined adjustments to account for SST operation. The airline operation effects are\nincluded by developing a pattern of missions to represent the total scope of SST operation.\nThe means of including all these effects in determining service life are practically the\nsame for subsonic and supersonic operation and have been developed from a history of\nsubsonic transport operation. The new influence on service life not significantly present\nin subsonic operation, is the thermal cycle associated with a Mach 2.7 transport. The\neffects of this thermal cycle require special attention to assure a proper accounting in\nanalytical procedures.\nENGINEERING THE TEMPERATURE EFFECTS\nInvestigations of thermal cycle considerations required for Ti-6A1-4V structure in\nenvironments in the region of 5000 F indicated that developing the following areas of influence will properly account for the thermal cycle: real-time and short-time test correlation, long-time temperature exposure, and phase-cycle relationship of temperature and\nstress. As indicated in figure 9, the mechanical stress and thermal-gradient stress are\nadded directly when studying the history of stress with temperature on a design detail.\nConsideration of these factors shall provide the corrections necessary to account for\nthermal effects.\nTemperature and time have always been two variables strongly related in establishing material properties. Some indication of real-time and short-time test correlation is\nshown in figure 10. Initial testing reported under this Department of Transportation contract began in 1963 and is continuing at this date. The program data shown here was\ndesigned to compare a 65-minute flight cycle with three accelerated tests. An accelerated load spectrum was run at 900 F constant temperature, 5000 F constant temperature,\nand a 900 F to 500 0 F cyclic temperature. The accelerated tests on sheet and extrusion\nmaterial both showed a deterioration in life at higher constant temperature and also\nshowed deterioration at cyclic temperature, although not as great as at 500 0 F constant\ntemperature. Real-time tests have completed in excess of 36 000 flight cycles, only one\n369\n\nsheet specimen out of a total of 12 sheet and extrusion specimens failing. These test\nresults encourage further analyses with a hope that accelerated tests may correlate with\nreal-time tests somewhere near a factor of one. Testing is continuing and other tests\nare underway to augment this data.\nThe effect of long-time temperature exposure was conveniently included in the\nbasic S-N data by developing the data with specimens previously exposed to 500 0 F for\n500 hours. This procedure is justified by data shown in figures 11 to 13. Figure 11\nshows the ratio of exposed to unexposed cyclic maximum stresses and gives 10 5 cycles\nof life at a stress ratio R = 0.06 for Ti-6A1-4V baseline specimens heat soaked for the\nindicated hours and then tested at room temperature. Figure 12 shows the same ratio\nfor Ti-6A1-4V lap joints with varying fastener installations exposed to both load and temperature for 500 hours and 1000 hours. These data demonstrate a reduction in allowable\nstress for equivalent life with temperature exposure for 500 hours. Further exposure\nproduces little change. Figure 13 shows results of similar more extensive testing conducted in Ti-8A1-1Mo-1V center-notched specimens exposed to both steady-state and\ncyclic load and temperature. In this case subsequent fatigue testing is at 500 0 F after\nthe specified exposure. With varying exposure up to 20 000 hours cyclic and 30 000 hours\nsteady state, all data, independent of how much exposure, falls into a reasonable scatter\nband. For analysis of the SST prototype, this type of data justified a convenient, 500 0 F,\n500 hours (3 weeks) exposure before life testing. Thus, the effect of long-time temperature exposure is included in the S-N curves used for fatigue-check analysis.\nIn the accelerated test data of figure 10 with the same maximum temperature, there\nis an indication that fatigue life improved over that at constant temperature when temperature and stress were both cycled. From many sources the data of figure 14 establishes\na life ratio curve for life at constant elevated temperature. A comparison in figure 15 of\nthis curve with data from tests wherein temperatures were cycled in phase with stress,\nshows an improvement in fatigue life for the 0 0 phase difference stress-temperature\ncycle. Extending this basic idea through all phase-angle differences develops the life\nratio factor rl of figure 16 as a means to correct service life computations for variations of the phase angle between stress cycles and temperature cycles. The design analyst reviewing his temperature and stress history, in addition to determining GAG stress\nlimits, must determine the maximum temperature and the significant phase-angle difference between his stress and temperature flight cycle.\nIn order to engineer temperature effects into a simplified fatigue-check procedure\nfor prototype design, the following guidelines are offered:\n(1) Accelerated test procedures can be established to assure real-time and shorttime test correlation near a factor of one.\n\n370\n\n(2) Long-term temperature exposure is accounted for by exposing test specimens\nfor\n\nS-N data to 500 0 F for 500 hours and then testing at room temperature.\n\n(3) The stress-temperature cycle phasing correction factor\naccount for the balance of temperature effects.\n\nTJ\n\nof figure 16 will\n\nTOTAL DAMAGE RE LA TED TO GAG DAMAGE\nSince a method has been provided for the design analyst to define the primary GAG\nstress cycle, one key to establishing a quick fatigue-check procedure is to relate total\ndamage to GAG damage on the elements of primary structure. By extensive use of computer programs to define internal load distribution and conduct fatigue analysis on discrete parts of typical primary structure, the ratio 6 of GAG fatigue damage to total\nfatigue damage can be determined. Typical plots of the GAG damage ratio developed\nfor handbook use are shown for the wing lower surface in figure 17 and for the body sections in figure 18. It is now possible to set up a simple formula which determines a\nnumber of GAG cycles NGAG which will produce equivalent total fatigue damage.\n\nNGAG = nGAG\n\n(FRF)\n7]15\n\nwhere\nnumber of cycles to produce equivalent total fatigue damage\nthe number of flights in which the primary GAG cycle is determined for a\n50 000 flight hour service life, or where a primary GAG cycle is not apparent, a number of primary load cycles in a 50 000 flight hour service life for\nwhich the damage ratio 15 is known or can be estimated\nFRF\n\nfatigue reliability factor defined in handbook tables\nratio of fatigue life at stress-temperature cycle phasing to room-temperature\nfatigue life\nratio of GAG fatigue damage to total fatigue damage\n\nSince NGAG , GAG a\n\' and GAG a\nare known, it is now necessary to determine\nMAX\nMIN\nthe proper quality level of S-N data which can be used to determine service life.\n\n371\n\nRATING OF STRUCTURAL DETAILS\nIt has been common practice to rate structural details by determining apparent\nstress concentration factors Krr and using S-N curves with the same apparent stress\nconcentration factor to determine fatigue life of that detail. Many textbook and handbook\nsources are available to determine apparent stress concentration factors. For communication to the design analyst, who likes to do his thinking with loads, load paths , and\nstresses, Krr gives some feel for fatigue quality but does not necessarily provide good\ncommunication. High values of apparent stress concentration KT give low values of\nservice life. The quantity Krr defines some local magnification of stresses that reduce\nlife. Although for calculation purposes the detail fatigue ratings (DFR) defined in this\n\nreport depend on values of KT\' DFR values are a more useful communication term with\nan engineering feel closer to the design analyst\'s pattern of thinking.\n\nuMAX\n\nThe DFR number found useful in this report is defined as the maximum cyclic stress\nin a constant-amplitude loading cycle at which the design detail will withstand\n\n10 5 cycles at a stress ratio R of 0.06. This stress ratio is a convenient testing ratio\nand 10 5 cycles represents a re liability factor of 4 on 25 000 flights, which is near the\nfatigue life range of Significance on the SST prototype. Figures 19 and 20 show ranges\nof value of the DFR number for various detail coupon tests and for various lap joint tests,\nrespectively. If this DFR number is plotted against l/Krr for variations in a type of\nstructural detail, it will develop, within test scatter, as a straight line, as shown in figure 21. Consequently, for the convenience of the design analysts, tables can be produced\nwith governing constants specified for various design details. Somewhat more convenient,\nas more test data and experience develops, charts similar to figure 22 are prepared and\nadded to the analysis handbook.\nFor communication purposes the DFR number communicates a stress number; the\ngreater it is, the better the fatigue quality. A value of 65 ksi is high quality in Ti- 6Al-4V\nstructure and is achieved in basic skin- stringer structure with high-quality fastener\ninstallations. Low-quality values can go below 20 ksi in the low-quality joint installations.\nThe Significance of the DFR number in specifying S-N data is illustrated in\nfigures 23 and 24. Figure 23 is a set of S-N curves for a DFR of 30 ksi and figure 24 is for a DFR of 45 ksi. In each case this rating number establishes the relative quality of each set of curves by being the u\ngiving 10 5 cycles at R::: 0.06.\nMAX\nIf on each plot the design analyst considers a design detail for which he has determined\nGAG u\n= 50 ksi and GAG u\nMIN = 20 ksi, the service life variation is apparent.\nMAX\n\n(UM1N\n\nis the minimum cyclic stress.) At DFR\n\n= 30\n\nksi, the fatigue life is about\n\n5 x 10 4 cycles; at DFR = 45 kSi, the fatigue life is about 2 x 10 5 cycles.\nquality provides four times the fatigue life.\n372\n\nThe higher\n\nCONSTANT-LIFE CHECK CHARTS\nAfter development of a family of S-N curves for a range of design quality, it is a\nsimple procedure to prepare detail fatigue-check charts for a range of constant-life values. As shown for N = 10 5 cycles in figure 25, this procedure allows a plot of the two\nvariables, GAG AMAX and DFR, in a form most useful to the design analyst. These\ntwo variables plot as a family of lines for different values of stress ratio. With a family\nof these detail fatigue-check charts covering the range of cyclic interest, interpolation\ncan be conducted for a design detail at any NGAG to establish the required relationship\nof DFR and GAG AMAX at a known value of R.\nThe design analyst can enter the fatigue-check charts with either UMAX or DFR\nand determine important design trades. Entering the chart with a calculated cyclic\n\'MAX might represent a case where a desired level of working stress is apparent from\nother design considerations. Figure 26 illustrates this case and points out the design\nterms established for the case where N = 200 000 cycles. The ordinate value defines\na minimum detail quality required for this c\' MAX . If DFR is actually higher or lower,\nthe design analyst moves up or down the R value line to determine an appropriate allowable AMAX . Entering the chart with a trial DFR is illustrated in figure 27. In either\ncase the design analyst can quickly determine the value of improving his design quality\nor of changing his cyclic stress level.\nFATIGUE ANALYSIS PROCEDURE\nThe fatigue-check procedure is made available to each design analyst on the SST\nprototype by a structural fatigue handbook. By management directive, a design has not\nbeen structurally reviewed unless it has been checked for its repeated load environment\nas well as for its strength and stiffness requirements. Unless a specific exception can\nbe justified for prototype only, the prototype design details shall qualify for the specified\nproduction service life of 50 000 flight hours.\nTo illustrate the fatigue-check procedure, assume the design analyst is looking at\na wing lower surface skin-stringer detail forward of the rear spar at buttock line (BL) 550.\n(See fig. 17.) He would like to use standard rivet installations in order to minimize\nassembly costs. The procedure would be\n(1) Following through the segmented sections of the mean mission of figure 6, computations of internal load distribution and the gradient effects of the thermal cycle will\nproduce a normal operating stress and temperature history similar to that of figure 9.\nFrom such data the primary GAG stress cycle is determined as\n\'MAX=25ksi(R=-0.5)\n373\n\nAlso from a plot similar to figure 9 it appears that the stress-temperature phase relationship is near 90 0 with a maximum temperature of 430 0 F.\n(2) It is now necessary to determine the number of GAG cycles NGAG that will\nproduce equivalent total fatigue damage. By referring to figure 16, the stresstemperature cycle phasing correction is\n77\n\n= 0.85\n\nBy referring to figure 17, the GAG damage ratio is\n5 = 0.80\nFrom handbook tables and test data considerations, the fatigue reliability factor for this\ndetail in Ti-6A1-4V is\nFRF = 5.8\nConservatively, including full-stop landings in the number of required flights,\nn GAG - 23 500 cycles\nConsequently,\nR\n\nNGAG - nGAG F bF = 200 000 cycles\n(3)With N GAG and oMAX at R = -0.5 known, the design analyst enters figure 26 and determines the minimum DFR required to provide 50 000 flight hours of service life; that is, a required DFR of 40 ksi.\n(4) With the geometric, fabrication, and installation details, the design analyst must\ndetermine the actual DFR. From figure 22,\nActual DFR of 56 ksi > Required DFR of 40 ksi\nTherefore the installation provides more than satisfactory service life. If surrounding\ninstallations are compatible, weight may be removed from the installation by increasing\nstress levels to match the actual DFR. The weight reduction is only possible if static\nstrength and stiffness requirements will permit.\nIf testing or previous experience had not provided a chart of DFR values for this\ninstallation, the structural fatigue handbook would have provided the constants needed in\nfigure 21 to calculate an actual DFR. By the use of this procedure the design analyst can\ndevelop an understanding of the stress or detail quality modifications necessary to qualify\nfor service life.\n374\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nA fatigue-check procedure requiring minimum additional effort is proposed for use\nby design analysts who must review structure and "firm up" design details before drawing\nrelease. The concept presented here satisfies part of the need of leaving the designer of\nstructural details cognizant of the good and bad points of design for service life.\nAs compared with subsonic transports the primary new environment variable\ninfluencing fatigue design on the American SST is the thermal cycle associated with a\nMach 2.7 cruise speed. The effects of this thermal cycle can be included in fatiguecheck procedures by accounting for real-time and short-time test correlation, long-time\ntemperature exposure, and phase cycle relationship of temperature and stress. Because\nof the SST type of operation, relatively large parts of fatigue damage develop on wing and\nbody primary structure from ground-air-ground (GAG) cycles. By determining the relationship of GAG damage to total fatigue damage on typical primary structures, fatiguecheck procedures can be greatly simplified.\nBy using a detail fatigue rating (DFR) designated by a maximum cyclic stress\ninstead of using the apparent stress concentration factor directly, a better communication term is available to evaluate relative fatigue quality of design details.\n\n375\n\n376\n\nc\n\n\'"\nE\n\n<1>\n\n.~\n\'-\n\n<1>\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n.s:::\n\nI-\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n,\nN\n\n377\n\nV\'\n-.J\n\nco\n\nSST PROGRAM SCHEDULE\n\n1960\'S\nI NOW\n1970\'S\n1980\'S\n8 1 0 11 1 !31 15 16 17 18 191 0 i:l !2 I31 15 16 I 718 1910 11 I 2131 15 I 6 1718 191 0 11\n91\n2\n4\n4\n4\nPROTOTYPE (pT)\nDESIGN CONSTRUCTION\n100 HR.

The\nfollowing procedures apply generally in the tests discussed:\n(1) Skins are machined, either chemically or mechanically\n(2) Their surfaces are blasted with glass beads and wet sand\n(3) They are given a surface protection and painted\n(4) No bonding is used.\nFATIGUE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT\nIt is well known that bolts with tight fit give a definite increase in fatigue life.\nHowever, this increase is guaranteed only if every bolt is mounted with the right fit\nand if no undetectable fault may change the assumed condition.\nConical Fasteners\nFor a long time we have been using bolts or fasteners with tight fits of 5 to\n30 microns, with very satisfactory results. But it is quite a problem to achieve a\nguaranteed fatigue life of 40 000 hours while saving much weight, especially in the\njoints or in the lower skin of the wing. The search for a higher admissible stress is\nthen a constant undertaking.\nConical bolts had at first sight appeared most interesting. There was indeed\nthe danger of stress corrosion when a tight fit of 90 microns was used with alloys such\nas 2024-T3 and 2014-T6, but riveting on short transverse components is infrequent,\nand less sensitive alloys may be used. A test program was started with two types of\ntest specimens, a "dog bone" type and a lap joint. (See fig. 1.)\nThe first test results (fig. 2) were most encouraging, until a test specimen broke\nafter a disappointingly low number of cycles. A more thorough inspection of the test\npiece (which had been inspected prior to testing) showed a reaming fault as in figure 3.\nThe bolt bears only on four regions.\n405\n\nIt was necessary to determine why this fault existed and why it had escaped inspection. The first problem was easy to resolve. It took many years to learn how to drill\na perfectly circular cylindrical hole. Conical holes, because of their high drilling\ntorques, will surely require still more development and tooling for reliable results.\nWith limited tooling, we succeeded in drilling correct holes up to 6 mm in diameter and\n8 mm deep. But for larger diameters, very rigid jigs and expensive tooling were needed.\nBoth the cost of tooling and the drilling time were found to be prohibitive for an extensive\nconical fastening.\nFurthermore, inspection was most difficult, with the necessity of blueing checks at\nevery hole, which increased the cost of the total operation. Finally, a subsequent test\nwith holes purposely drilled incorrectly showed a dramatic decrease in fatigue life. (See\nfig. 4.) These results, added to the danger of stress corrosion, led to the decision not to\nuse conical fasteners in the Mercure.\nHole Preparation\nIn an attempt to increase the fatigue life of structures, the following processes\nwere examined:\n(1) The way in which the hole is made:\n(a) Normal reaming\n(b) Heli-Armor reaming\n(c) Broaching\n(2) The finish given after reaming:\n(a) Deburring\n(b) Roll over\nSignificant differences were found between treated and untreated holes without rivets\n(fig. 5). On the other hand, once the bolt is set, these differences decrease and even\ndisappear (fig. 6).\nInterference Fit\nOn one hand, interference fit has a positive influence on fatigue life, but on the other\nhand, beyond a certain level of interference (30 microns), fretting under the fastener\nbecomes too important unless special care is taken. Figure 7 shows the type of failure\nin each case. With the free bolt, the crack started in the cylindrical part of the hole, but\nwith the interference-fit bolts, the cracks started by fretting in the countersink.\n\n406\n\nAntifretting Protection\nIn all previously described tests standard sealing and surface protection treatments\nwere used; that is, rivets were wet mounted with PR 1422 or Blendexite and the test\nspecimens were painted with PR 1460 or Cellolac 78-28. Figure 8 shows the effect on\nfatigue life when one of these two protections is omitted. The fatigue life was reduced by\nfretting underneath the fastener collar when the specimen was not painted, and in the\ncountersink when the rivet was dry mounted.\nSelecting Parameters for Mounting a Fastener\nThe results of these experiments led to the selection of the following procedures:\n(1) Use of a moderate amount of interference (bearing in mind the problem of stress\ncorrosion)\n(2) Painting and wet mounting\nThe influence of the way in which the hole is obtained is not so obvious. Broaching\nand Heli-Armor give comparable results, but broaching is an extremely reliable method\nof obtaining holes of a high standard, while Heli-Armor may be less reliable. The\n"miracle" alloy for the best life has appeared to be 2024-T3. (We have not tested\n7075-T73.)\nFAIL-SAFE DESIGNS\nGeneral Considerations\nThe greatest risk of crack initiation is surely incurred in joints. Multiplying stress\nconcentrations by using, for example, riveted reinforcements around door openings should\nbe avoided as much as possible. Integral structures mechanically or chemically milled\nmight seem a good solution, but then the difficult problem of fail-safe design enters the\npicture.\nWe have already made some remarks about this problem at Melbourne, having been\nunfavorably impressed by some examples of so-called fail-safe design, the most classic\nbeing a structure cut in two pieces and bolted back together. Since then the situation has\napparently worsened, judging by the design of some recent tail-unit hinges and controlsurface bearings.\nAre the regulations responsible? It is certain that FAR 25-573 encourages a\ndesigner who does not want to put questions to himself to demonstrate that a structure\ncan sustain the required static load when one of the elements has failed. This test\nallows him to claim that his structure is fail-safe. Moreover, the same paragraph allows\na failure to be considered only partial if it is obvious.\n407\n\nAs far as fatigue is concerned, the basic idea, in itself quite legitimate, of\nassuring security by means of residual strength has been put in a wrong way.\nFatigue and Fail-Safe\nOf course a fatigue test is not a fail-safe demonstration by itself, but it is not negligible in assessing structural fail-safe designs. Also, fatigue testing is a good method\nfor determining inspection schedules for the various parts of the airplane.\nWe do not believe that an element cut in two, but in which cracks appear and grow\nrapidly, is sufficiently fail-safe. What happens to the half of this element carrying the\nwhole load when the other half has broken?\nSome recent mishaps with elements working in parallel should prove of interest.\nOne instance was the F-14 prototype, in which two hydraulic tubes used on separate circuits, but subjected to the same fatigue duty, gave up in a 5-minute interval.\nAnother example of a more structural nature was found during a fatigue test on a\nmilitary aircraft. The main frame supporting the bending moment of the wing was made\nof two rings working in parallel. (See fig. 9.) Cracks appeared and grew almost identically in the two rings, and a rupture occurred in each, the load being then supported by\nthe remaining structure outside.\nAnother example concerns a wing attachment (fig. 10). Cracks grew at the same\ntime from five holes and, what is more, on both wings. To have separated the attachment\ninto halves would only have given a formal fail-safe structure without increasing enough\nthe safety of the design.\nThese problems occurred because the fatigue life was short enough for all the\npieces involved to be damaged. A quite different case appeared in the test of the Mercure\nmain frame. An artificial crack in the flange of the frame grew only on one half of the\nflange, not passing the "wall" of the web, and at a rate low enough to be found in\ninspections.\nHere the stress was lower, and this explains most of the difference. Thus a fatigue\ntest may give important indications for fail-safe designs.\nThere is a still worse method for obtaining fail-safe. Take a beam with an I-section,\nthe tensioned flange of this beam being perfectly smooth, without any hole. Then replace\nthe integral tension flange by riveted flanges, the tensioned area being the same. Failsafe is not definitely guaranteed and fatigue life is severely decreased.\nIf you feel unable to insure safety with such a monopiece structure, you can design\na double load path while avoiding putting rivets in the tensioned zone. You will keep good\nfatigue life and get a double load path at the same time, but perhaps you will have some\ntrouble with fretting or corrosion.\n408\n\nFail-Safe and Unexpected Cracks\nThe double load path finds its soundest justification in unexpected cracks. However,\nthis should not deter the designer from looking at the types of remaining risks and finding\na solution to them. These risks can be defined as flaws in the material, fretting, and\nstress corrosion. With correct designs, care, and inspection these difficulties can be\novercome, and we have to work for that in any possible way.\nImportant Conclusions Regarding Fail-Safe\nCertainly a low stress level is an important factor for fail-safe guarantee. For\nless important elements where weight loss is small, no regrets should be had in designing\nwith important margins for a theoretically infinite life. But this is not enough. During\nthe fatigue tests and after, it is necessary to monitor the crack propagation rates at every\npoint which may be critical. The results should be linked with the inspection schedule of\nthese particular points.\nDouble load path must not be neglected. But its reliability must be assured with\nregard to fatigue considerations as well as corrosion and fretting, and the structure must\nnot be weakened by a bad design.\nOUR FAIL-SAFE APPROACH\nIt must be admitted that we have often used the classic fail-safe methods described\nhere. However, even in these cases we applied the procedures described in the following\nparagraphs to investigate crack propagation.\nPhotoelastic Tests\nFor the Mercure design, we had previously developed tests on photoelastic models\nand on metal parts coated with photostress material (figs. 11 to 13). Thus, we were able\nto study stress concentrations on a particular component, and even on an entire element\nof the fuselage. Also, we were able to determine critical areas where we could provoke\ncracks.\nPartial Fatigue Test\nUsually the area where we want fail-safe capability of a one-piece structure is\ngreatly overdimensioned for fatigue. So we perform tests with normal fatigue loads,\nfollowed by cycles at higher loads. During these tests, cracks must not originate.\n\n409\n\nCrack Propagation\nNext we artificially provoke cracks in critical areas \xe2\x80\x94 that is, areas where calculations and photostress investigations show stress concentrations. (See fig. 14.) The\ncrack growth rate is plotted against time in order to define a schedule of inspections that\nwill provide detection in service before the risk of dangerous failure is encountered.\nThis implies that the tests are based on particular conditions.\nIt is best to have two types of cycles. The first, with only normal fatigue loads, is\napplied on specimens to monitor the crack growth rate. The second, including the same\nnormal fatigue loads, also includes "fail-safe" loads, and is applied on other specimens to\nevaluate the critical length of crack beyond which a static failure may occur.\nAnother possible application for fail-safe design is found in secondary effects (fuel\nleakage, for instance).\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe double load path, although a good fail-safe concept in many cases, is not entirely\nsatisfactory. It may be insufficient when fatigue life is too short, and superfluous when\nthe stress is low, detection is easy, or fail-safe capability is achieved by other means.\nThe best procedure is to rely on crack growth-rate studies and guaranteed crack\ndetection by inspection in service.\nThe use of double load path to cope with unexpected phenomena such as stress corrosion or flaws seems rather makeshift, and it is better to seek specific action (improved\nforgings, inspection, protection) in each case.\nThe easier the inspection, the better for fail-safe.\n\n410\n\nt\'-.\n\n(\'J\n\nI~\n\n+\n\n+1I\n\n+\n+ +1\n+ I\n+ +1\n~\n""\nt\'-.\n\nz\n\ncr::\nw\nW\nf-Ci)\n\n~\n\n......\n\n~\n\n\\Q\n\n0\n\n~\n\nI\n\n\\Q\n\n0\n\n4\n\nL/),\n\n-.0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nf--\n\nZ\n0\nJ\nCL\n\n~\n\n\xc2\xab\n\n~\n\nZ\n\nW\n\n0\n\nen\n(9\n\n0\n\n0\n~\n\nV>\n\nc:\nE\n\n<l>\n\n5}\n\n<l>\n\n\'u\n<l>\n\n\'t;\n\n~\n\n>,\n.....;\n0>\n\n:::J\n\n~\n\n411\n\n/\n\n......\n"""\nN\n\n10\n\n7\n\n1-\n\n--\n\n\'"\n\n<Ed>\n\n3.10 6\neyel es\n\n10\n\n3.10\n\n10\n\n6\nI\n\nn\n\nl::3\n\nI I\n\n5\n\n5\nLOOSE\n(BLIND\n\nFIT\nHUCK\n\nINTERFERENCE\nFIT\n\nTAPER\nLOK\n\nFASTE N ERS )\nFigure 2.- Early results with Taper Lok and classic fasteners in \'\'dog bone" sample of 2014 or 2024-T6 aluminum alloy.

Burbach\nKrupp Forschungsinstitut, Germany\nThe elastic-plastic deformation behavior under cyclic stress of a number of different engineering materials was experimentally investigated with the aid of highprecision methods of measuring, some of which had been newly developed. (See refs. 1\nto 4.) The report covers, in particular, experiments made with a variety of steels, the\ntitanium alloy Ti-A16-V4, a cobalt (tungsten) alloy, the high-temperature material\nNimonic 90 and Dural (Al-Cu). The theory given \xe2\x80\x94 in an attempt to explain these\nexperiments \xe2\x80\x94 is aimed at finding general formulas for the cyclic stress-strain behavior of engineering materials.\nThe experimental and theoretical investigations made can be summarily described\nas follows:\n(1) Geometric relationships of stable mechanical hystereses at a given variation of\nstress or strain and normal strain-rate dependence at cyclic deformation\n(plain and notched specimens) (refs. 5 and 6)\n(2) Accurate and direct measurement of the second-order elastic constants of\npolycrystals and their influence on the test result\n(3) Accurate balance of elastic and plastic energy in cyclic deformation, particularly in microscopic inhomogeneous plastic deformation\n(4) Spreading of Luders bands in cyclic deformation; phenomena of strain hardening and removal of strain hardening\n(5) Inverse strain-rate dependence for aluminum-copper alloys\n(6) Investigations relating to cumulative damage at irregular cycling of stress.\nThe investigations, unfortunately, showed that cyclic stress-strain curves do not\nprovide sufficient information for developing cumulative damage formulas that are sufficiently accurate from the physical aspect or suitable for engineering application. For\nthis reason, it is not possible for the time being to give up practical simulation of actual\nmaterial stresses with modern fatigue-testing machines.\nThe accuracy of the measurements made is exemplified by the cyclic stressstrain behavior of a round bar specimen with a sharp notch. (See figs. 1 and 2.) The\nstress \xe2\x80\x94 related to specimen cross-sectional area in the notch root \xe2\x80\x94 is plotted against\nthe plastic deformation of the full-length specimen. It is clearly seen how the gradually\n425\n\npropagating crack causes a "nose" in the cyclic stress-strain curves; that is, the opening\nand closing of the crack becomes apparent.\nIn figure 1, the stress given is related to the notch-root cross section. The hysteresis curves shown were written with rising values of the plastic-strain amplitude. Strain\nmeasurement was made as usual at a distance between the edges of the inductive extensometer of 40 mm; thus, the mean value of the inhomogeneous extension was obtained.\nThe test represented by figure 1 was continued in such a way that with (approximately) constant amplitude of plastic strain, cyclic deformation proceeded. Continuation\nof the test eventually led to fracture of the specimen. See figure 2.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Burbach, J.: A Tensile Machine With a Particularly High Spring Constant. Techn.\nMitt.

Erismann\nFederal Laboratories for Testing Materials and Research\nDubendorf, Switzerland\nSUMMARY\nThe method proposed consists of two parts: empirical determination of certain\ncharacteristics of a material by means of a relatively small number of well-defined\nstandard tests, and arithmetical application of the results obtained to arbitrary loading\nhistories. The following groups of parameters are thus taken into account: the variations of the mean stress, the interaction of these variations and the superposed oscillating stresses, the spectrum of the oscillating-stress amplitudes, and the sequence of\nthe oscillating-stress amplitudes. It is pointed out that only experimental verification\ncan throw sufficient light upon possibilities and limitations of this (or any other) prediction method.\nFUNDAMENTALS OF PARAMETRIC APPROACH\nThe fundamental procedural scheme of the method evolved in this paper consists\nof the following phases:\n(1) Determination of a number of characteristics of the material by means of\nstandard tests\n(2) Prediction of the fatigue life of the material on the basis of these characteristics and an analysis of the expected loading history.\nThe problem thus raised can, in principle, always be solved since for a specified\naccuracy there will always be a finite number of tests from which the necessary data for\na satisfactory processing of the second phase can be drawn. There is, consequently, a\nproblem of interpolation which can be solved with a finite number of base points. The\nquestion remains how to attain the goal economically. In view of the present state of\ndevelopment of servo-hydraulic testing equipment and digital computers, neither irregular stress sequences in the standard tests nor extensive algorithms in analysis and\nevaluation are prohibitive.\nThe progress of our knowledge of fatigue strength has in the last few decades\nbecome an alarming "parameter explosion." Thus, in order to avoid undue complications, no mention will be made of parameter groups connected with notch effect or\nenvironmental influences and nothing but the loading history will be considered.\n429\n\nConsequently, the following effects will be taken into account:\n(1) Mean stress effect (index M), influence of the chronological curve of the mean\nstress\n(2) Interaction effect (index J), influence of systematically occurring correlations\nbetween the effects of mean and oscillating stresses\n(3) Spectral effect (index P), effect of the statistical distribution of the oscillatingstress variations\n(4) Sequence effect (index Q), effect of the sequence in which the individual stress\nvariations follow one another.\nThe parameters linked to these effects will be called in this paper "M.I.S.S. parameters"\nfrom their initial letters.\nOwing to the inherent complexity of the problem, a certain number of simplifying\nassumptions must be made. In particular it is assumed that\n(1) Miner\'s rule is applicable with sufficient accuracy to sufficiently narrow sections of a stress spectrum\n(2) The influence of the mean-stress effect can be described with sufficient accuracy\nby the statistical amplitude distribution of the variations occurring in the mean stress\n(3) Every increment of a loading history produces an incremental interaction effect\napproximately proportional to its mean stress level and to its "linear-damage increment"\n(according to Miner\'s rule)\n(4) The effect of the sequence extends mainly to the "coarse sequence" (that is, to\nchanges of the spectrum over longer periods of the loading history), whereas the "fine\nsequence" (that is, the individual sequence of the single-stress cycles) is of minor importance in practice, provided the process under consideration can be described with sufficient accuracy by stochastic characteristics\n(5) The effects of the M.I.S.S. parameters allow with sufficient accuracy a linear\n(in one exceptional case, a quadratic) interpolation when the logarithm of the "Miner sum"\n\t\n\n(1)\n\nL^ u Ni\n1\n\n(which according to Miner\'s rule should always be equal to 1) is used as the interpolation\nvalue. In equation (1), n i is the number of cycles applied at stress level whereas Nj\nis the total number of cycles to cause failure at stress level.\nIt is not possible here to justify these assumptions. A justification of these assumptions is given in reference 1.\n430\n\nOUTLINE OF THE M.I.S.S. METHOD\nThe method outlined here starts from relation (1); it being clearly understood, however, that a sum not equal to 1 is permissible. In accordance with the assumptions\nmade, the four M.I.S.S. parameters P M , PJ , PP , and PQ are defined and\nf(PM ,PJ ,P P ,PQ ) .\t\n\n(2)\n\nis postulated. This postulation means that the spectrum, as in Miner\'s rule, is still the\nmost important group of parameters, but not the only decisive one.\nThus, the first phase of the method results in the performance of an unequivocally\ndefined series of standard tests with well-defined M.I.S.S. parameters and the determinawhich are to be considered as charaction of the resulting standard Miner sums \t\nL_js\n\nteristics of the material.\nThe second phase, that is, the application to an expected loading history with a\ngiven nominal fatigue life, is divided into the following partial phases:\n(1) Analysis of the loading history according to equation (1). The result is the\nWoehler-Miner sum\n(2) Analysis of the loading history according to well-defined formulae for determining their M.I.S.S. parameters.\n(3) Application of the M.I.S.S. parameters as a means of interpolation in the results\nfield of the standard Miner sums. The result is the Effective Miner sum\n\nvE\n\n(4) Formation of the quotient I /11W which indicates the chances of survival of\nE\nthe specimen. For &/^ W > 1, survival of the loading history is to be expected.\nThe first and fourth phases are carried out according to the known algorithms of\nMiner\'s rule. The interpolation in the third phase must mainly be carried out linearly\nfor log\nFigure 1 shows the interpolation for PM and PJ , with Pp and PQ\n\nI.\n\nheld constant. The heights of the column at its four edges represent the results of four\nstandard tests. The result of the interpolation is the height (heavy dotted line) for PM\nand PJ . Only the standard tests and the stress-history analysis need to be considered\nin more detail.\n\n431\n\nMATHEMATICAL TREATMENT OF PARAMETER GROUPS\nIt would be impossible to give a complete review of the mathematical deductions\n\napplied to obtain appropriate equations for the calculation of the M.I.S.S. parameters.\nIt must be referred, therefore, to more detailed works on the subject. (See refs. 1 and 2.)\nThe following remarks are made in order to give a general idea of the logical structure\nof the method.\nAll the equations used in this connection are based solely on the simplifying\nassumptions made. For instance, the second assumption means only that the mean\nstress effect for given values of the other parameters is determined by the "spectrum of\nthe mean stress" so that Miner\'s rule may be considered as applicable to the mean\nstress. Thus, an extremely simple definition of the mean-stress parameter is obtained;\nthat is,\nIll\n-\t\nP M\t(3)\nN O),\nL.1W\nwhere N o is the number of mean-stress variations of the value a, and N Q is the\ncycle number pertaining to Q according to the Q-N curve. The division by the\nWoehler-Miner sum ^ W is used for normalizing purposes.\nThe spectrum of a loading history is represented in principle by a parabolic\napproximation so that theoretically, three parameters are needed for the mean value, the\naverage slope, and the curvature of the parabola. The first of these parameters, however, is insignificant since in the chosen representation, the mean value of the parabola\nis given. It is a particular feature of the method that the ordinal numbers i of certain\nwell-defined stresses ai are used as values of the independent variable of the approximation so that the respective numbers ni are expressed by\nnl\n\n=c0+c1 \xe2\x80\xa2 i+c2 \xe2\x80\xa2i2. . .\t\n\n(4)\n\nNi 1W\nwhere co , c l , and c 2 are the spectral parameters PP.\nIII more or less analogous way, the parameters for interaction and sequence, P\nand PQ, are deduced from the assumptions made. Both are connected with variations\nof the spectral parameter c l ; thus, predominance of high- or low-stress amplitudes\nunder particular conditions is indicated. Although P establishes a correlation with\nthe mean stress am (taking into account such phenomena as the increased dynamic\nforces due to increased payload of a vehicle), P Q accounts for variations undergone in\n432\n\nthe course of the loading history as a whole (as encountered owing to more frequent overload when an aircraft is transformed from passenger to cargo transport); thus, it serves\nas a safeguard against unpleasant surprises, because many materials have a shorter\nfatigue life when first subjected to low- and then to high-stress amplitudes.\nThe influence of parameter variations upon loading histories is illustrated in figures 2, 3, and 4. In figure 2, the oscillating stresses are not present for negative mean\nstresses because of the choice of constants in the equations. In figure 3 the stress\namplitudes are higher in section II than section I; thus, a higher value of c l is indicated. In figure 4, the variation of c 2 results in predominance either of extreme (high\nand low) or of medium amplitudes. It will be observed that in figure 3, section II shows\nhigher stress amplitudes than section I; thus, a higher value of c 1 is indicated. Variation of c2 results in predominance either of extreme (high and low) or of medium\namplitudes (fig. 4).\nSTANDARD TESTS AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION\nSince linear interpolation of log\t\n\nhas been accepted for all parameters\n\n(excluding c l), variations through all possible combinations other than the meaningless\nones (PM = O i ; PJ + 0) would give 36 base points which can be found from 36 tests\n(plus repetitions). The cost is considerable but is certainly justified for important\nmaterials.\nExperience will show whether all 36 standard tests are really required. The number depends on how far the multidimensional functions of figure 1 can be approximated by\nplane surfaces. If, for example, it should be found that, apart from P P , the function\nsurface can be considered as sufficiently plane, then only the inclinations of this plane\nwould have to be known; that is, for every additional parameter only one single base point\nwould have to be determined and nine tests would suffice. Probably the truth lies between\nthese two extremes.\nAn actual "cooking recipe" for the details of the method is found in reference 1.\nThere the individual steps are not only commented on but are also compiled in tabular\nform so that the economic establishment of suitable computer programs is possible.\nPOSSIBILITIES AND LIMITATIONS\nBy the method described, it is possible to determine the probable fatigue life of a\nZ, material under a given loading history without having to carry out a large number\nof loading tests. As a matter of fact, the standard Miner sums as characteristics of a\nmaterial, together with the u-N curve, should contain enough data to predict the fatigue\n433\n\nlife of a material with sufficient accuracy even in irregular stress sequences. The main\npoint obviously is \'What is meant by "sufficient accuracy" T Of course, the M.I.S.S.\nmethod is more expensive than the determination of a number of u-N curves, although not\nimpossibly so. In return, it refines the results obtained from Miner\'s rule (which are\nderived only from Q-N curves). Only systematic tests with different materials can give\na definite answer. Such tests should prove worthwhile, for even Miner\'s rule in its\npresent form is better than it is usually believed to be. Thus, it should usually be possible to supplement it by introducing additional parameters (mean stress, interaction, and\nsequence) so that the result can satisfy the demands of practice.\nIt must be stressed in this connection that the testing equipment available should be\nimproved in the sense of cheaper and faster execution of large numbers of irregular\nfatigue tests. Only such a development will guarantee in reasonable time the acquisition\nof the information necessary for an efficient verification of the methods proposed here\nor elsewhere.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

Wood\nAir Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory, U.S. Air Force\nUnited States\nSUMMARY\nThis report reviews the application of applied fracture mechanics in the design,\nanalysis, and qualification of aircraft structural systems. Recent service experiences\nare cited.\nCurrent trends in high-strength materials application are reviewed with particular emphasis on the manner in which fracture toughness and structural efficiency may\naffect the material selection process.\nGeneral fracture control procedures are reviewed in depth with specific reference to the impact of inspectability, structural arrangement, and material on proposed\nanalysis requirements for safe crack growth. The relative impact on allowable design\nstress is indicated by example.\nDesign criteria, material, and analysis requirements for implementation of fracture control procedures are reviewed together with limitations in current available data\ntechniques. A summary of items which require further study and attention is\npresented.\n\n"Fracture Mechanics has, in fact, been a boon to the metal producing industry; it\nhas made the finite crack in a structure reputable and even fashionable." (Quoted from\nA. M. Freudenthal, Miami Beach, Florida, December 1969.)\nINTRODUCTION\nPrimary aircraft structural components generally contain flaws or defects of\nvariable shape, orientation, and criticality which are either inherent in the basic material or are introduced during the fabrication or assembly processes.\nFrom an industry survey (ref. 1) it was concluded that the majority of cracks\nfound in aircraft structures were initiated from tool marks, manufacturing defects, and\nthe like. When not detected, these flaws experience the combined driving forces of\nenvironment and service loading and may grow to serious proportions resulting in\n437\n\nreduction of service life or complete loss of the aircraft. The final fracture process is\nmost often sudden, unexpected, and almost totally devoid of gross plastic deformation or\nyielding. While this "brittlelike" behavior is most spectacular in the so-called highstrength alloys, it is seen to occur to some degree in most of the commonly used aircraft structural materials.\nRecent cases of catastrophic failure in primary structure of first-line aircraft\nhave emphasized the need for a "fresh" new look at the structural integrity process currently used to design and qualify structural systems. Under such an improved process,\nfracture control would insure the reduction in the probability of catastrophic failure due\nto the presence of undetected flaws and cracks. This assurance can best be achieved by\nthe intelligent material selection based on fracture as well as common strength considerations and by assuming the existence of flaws in "new" structures and accounting\nfor their probable growth during service.\nLinear elastic fracture mechanics analysis and testing techniques have reached\nthe state of development where they may be used with a moderate level of confidence to\nassess the degree of flaw criticality, to predict the extent of subcritical flaw growth\nprior to fracture, and to determine the resultant failure modes (ref. 2). Much of the\nbasic groundwork for the current application of linear elastic fracture mechanics to\n"real" structures can be attributed to the investigation associated with fracture control\nof metallic pressure vessels for space applications (refs. 3 and 4). While attempts to\ntranslate this technology to aircraft usage have been moderately successful, limitations\nmust be recognized which are due to the complex spectrum of loads, temperatures, and\nchemically aggressive agents that comprise the aircraft environment.\nFail-safe procedures in aircraft have resulted from civil requirements and from\nindependent regulation within the particular airframe company. These efforts have been\nbeneficial on many Air Force aircraft.\nApplication of fracture mechanics within the Air Force has been almost exclusively\n"after the fact" to determine remaining safe life with cracks, residual strength, and safe\ninspection intervals for older systems in which flaws have developed and progressed to\nnear-critical dimensions. Some examples of service application in which the Air Force\nFlight Dynamics Laboratory (AFFDL) actively participated are summarized in table I\n(see refs. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). In practically all cases, however, attempts to formulate\nreliable solutions were hampered by the lack of an adequate material-environmental data\nbase and deficiencies in analysis techniques, particularly those techniques which must\naccount for load interaction and environmental effects. One purpose of this paper is to\nreview those areas of application where deficiencies in the technology exist and to offer\nsuggestions for alleviating these deficiencies.\n\n438\n\nUnder the F-111 Recovery Program (ref. 9), basic fracture mechanics data are currently being amassed for D6ac steel by the contractor and several laboratories. (See\nrefs. 8, 11, and 12.)\nSpecific criteria, guidelines, or requirements for considering fracture mechanics\nprinciples in the design and procurement cycle for Air Force aircraft have not existed\nin the past. Only recently have requirements been levied for new systems. It is too\nearly to assess their impact. In the proposed revisions to the Air Force Airplane\nStructural Integrity Program (ASIP) which is given in reference 13, damage tolerance\nconsiderations are outlined. These changes are currently being reviewed prior to being\nformally incorporated.\nThere exists a natural unwillingness amongst many to accept the "preexistent flaw"\nconcept in aircraft design because of the weight penalties normally associated with\ndamage-resistant structures. There are those who cite system performance degradation and the time and cost of implementing fracture requirements as deterrents. The\nimposition of arbitrary fracture requirements should be done cautiously under current\nstate -of -the -art limitations in analysis methods and testing techniques are resolved and\nmaterial-environmental behavior is better understood.\nIn this paper, recent structural material utilization cases are summarized to indicate those problems associated with the use of high-strength material. General fracture\ncontrol procedures are reviewed with specific reference to the impact of safe crack\ngrowth and remaining strength requirements on system design. Examples are cited,\nincluding recent laboratory efforts in the analysis of crack growth under variableamplitude spectrum loading.

The process also has evolved\nincreased operating stresses and, thus, lower tolerance to flaws and cracks.\nThese applications have resulted in critical flaw dimensions of the order of the\nmaterial thickness which make positive detection by current nondestructive inspection\n(NDI) practice questionable. Current trends in the structural design utilization of highstrength alloys for resistance to catastrophic fracture can be evaluated by examining\ntrends in two basic material parameters, the plane strain fracture toughness index KIc\nand the conventional yield strength Qys.\nFor a specific application, the designer must select a material of reasonably high\nstrength in order to meet static strength requirements and still achieve minimum weight.\nA parameter for evaluating structural efficiency (Qys/p) is mentioned later. In the\nselection process, however, fracture toughness must be a consideration. The achievement of maximum yield strength and maximum fracture toughness is often difficult as is\nillustrated in figure 1. It is generally recognized that within certain material groups,\ntoughness decreases with increasing yield strength. This trend is illustrated in figure 1\nfor aluminum, titanium, and several selected steels where material data from table H\nhave been plotted. Variations in KIc can be expected for any given alloy and strength\n441\n\nlevel, and these variations are generally due to metallurgical aspects, impurities, or\nmanufacturing processing. This variability makes the selection of a "design allowable"\nextremely difficult.\nIn specifying a particular material and strength level (minimum acceptable ays),\nthe designer usually would not be concerned about those quantities of material which\npossessed strength levels on the upper end of the normal range. However, because of\nthe dramatic decrease in K Ic , he must in many cases limit the upper bound of acceptable\nrange of yield strength. This is current practice in specifying titanium alloys. In figure 1, KIc ranges for two common titanium alloys are noted. These data are shown at\none yield strength value to illustrate the fallacy in specifying only Qy s minimum.\nRecent F-111 experience with D6ac steel has indicated a similar phenomenon; however,\nthe variation of KIc is dependent upon the heat treatment procedure (ref. 9). In this\ncase, two specimens of material from different lots might possess the same measured\noys and yet have a two-to-one range in KIc\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe material selection process is therefore a trade-off procedure wherein many\nconcurrent requirements must be satisfied. For the case in point, the designer must\nestablish criteria for accepting either a reduced toughness or a reduced strength level.\nThe choice might be dictated by overall flaw tolerance. This is illustrated in figure 2\nwhere the ordinate (KIc/uys)2, a parameter indicative of crack size, is used. Since\nstructures are designed to withstand (statically) a percentage of the yield strength, this\nparameter may be conveniently used to illustrate flaw tolerance sensitivity. Examination\nof figure 2 indicates a more dramatic reduction in the crack length parameter with\nincreased yield strength.\nThe same trend is repeated in figure 3; however, the yield strength has been normalized with respect to the material density p. The parameter Qys/p is one form of\nstructural efficiency used to select materials. Note that material ranking has changed,\nwith titanium being superior to steel. One exception illustrated is that 18Ni-Co-Mo\nmaraging steel and 9Ni-4Co-2C fall beyond the bounds illustrated. There are recognizable limits on the values of both (Klc/oys)2 and Qysp for materials in use today.\nThe bounds are illustrated in figure 3.\nThe data presented in figure 3 clearly illustrate the relationship of nondestructive\ninspection (NDI) capability and material selection to resist brittle fracture. For\nexample, a through-the-thickness crack will experience plane strain fracture when\nK = KIc = Q7Tacr\xe2\x80\xa2 If fracture is assumed to occur at the design limit stress, the value\nof critical crack length a cr can be computed. For many aircraft structures, design\n2\t\nK\n( K Ic \\2\nThus each\no\nlimit stress is of the order of oL = 0.6Qys and acr = 0.6 Q\nC\n\t\nys^ YJ\t\npoint in figure 3 might be considered the critical characteristic flaw dimension for plane\n442\n\nstrain fracture and thus would describe the sensitivity level required for fleet inspection.\nFor this type of selection criterion, many materials may be prohibited because of the\nextremely small flaws which must be detected. Limits of NDI practice are not well\ndefined.\nWith the technological trend in material utilization growing toward greater strengthdensity ratios, it seems logical also to define more realistic limits on the material selection based on uncontrollable "human element" defects. Thus, the crack size definition of\nfigure 3 might indicate limits produced by normal tool marks, scratches, or gouges produced during manufacture or maintenance. If these limits are recognized as sound, then\nmore effective means of inspection may be required, such as proof testing, if use is to be\nmade of these alloys (fig. 4).\nAll the data from table II has been plotted in figure 5 with both KIc and oys\nnormalized with respect to density p. This plot indicates an apparent technological\nlimit which material producers might find difficult to exceed (ref. 2).\nIn the previous discussion it was assumed that plane strain fracture is dominant.\nFortunately, this is not always the case because of the effect of thickness, plasticity, and\ngeometry (figs. 6 and 7). The question does remain, however, as to what role K Ic has\nin the material selection and analysis process.\nIt is perhaps safe to conclude that the selection of candidate materials for fracture\nconsiderations can be made on the basis of superior K Ic , as long as the materials are\nsimilar. The decision, however, rests upon the thickness required to fulfill the task. In\nfigure 7, the variation of critical stress intensity factor with thickness is illustrated for\nseveral alloys (ref. 2).\nMATERIAL SELECTION \xe2\x80\x94 RESISTANCE TO FLAW GROWTH\nUNDER REPEATED LOADS\nIn the preceding discussion, KIc and oys were shown to be effective parameterE\nin selecting a material class and alloy to resist brittle fracture under plane strain conditions. Wide variations in strength and toughness were indicated within a given material.\nToughness was also seen to vary within a given alloy group.\nMaterial selection based on cyclic growth considerations is not as clearly defined,\nsince observed trends in rate data for a nonaggressive environment indicate that materials within a group or class generally fall within a narrow scatterband, with little, if any,\ndependence on toughness. Average growth-rate curves have been included in figure 8 to\nillustrate the relative relationship between materials. Hahn (ref. 6) has observed that the\nrate da/dN can be approximated for many materials as\n443\n\nda = 8 (AK)2\nE\ndN\t\nin the central or log linear portion of the growth-rate curve. Several points are shown\nin figure 8 which were obtained by using the Hahn expression. Because of the relationship of growth rate to modulus E, the data can be normalized with respect to the material density p as indicated in figure 9 where rate curves are seen to converge. It is\napparent, then, that a material\'s advantage can only be assessed on an individual application basis. Growth under variable-amplitude spectrum loading, for example, may produce\ndifferent trends in growth retardation due to the interaction of loads. Generally speaking,\nhowever, the time to failure from an initial flaw is dependent primarily upon the toughness\nKIc . This is illustrated in figure 10, with cutoffs for several levels of toughness. The\nrelative effect, however, may be dependent upon the shape and severity of the spectrum.\nWhile the preceding discussion has been concerned with the cyclic flaw growth\nbehavior, the selection of materials for repeated load application in the presence of flaws\nmay be seriously influenced by the chemical and thermal environments in which the structure must operate. No attempt is made in this paper to cover these trends. The reader\nis referred to several excellent publications (refs. 6, 11, 14, and 15).\nFRACTURE CONTROL \xe2\x80\x94 BASIC CONSIDERATIONS\nThe traditional Air Force approach to structural integrity (ref. 13) requires that\n"safe life" be evaluated through the cyclic test program. The success of this approach\nin determining the overall fatigue resistance of full-scale structures has been well\ndocumented (refs. 6 and 16). The achievement of "fatigue quality" through careful workmanship, surface finishes, and detailed design (local stress levels) and the demonstration\nof resistance to crack initiation are basic and reasonable goals. Therefore, before presenting suggested procedures for fracture control, it is important that two basic tenets\nbe stated:\n(1) Damage tolerant design and fracture control philosophy should not be considered\nas substitutes for adequate fatigue considerations.\n(2) Consideration must be given to the probable existence of flaws within all basic\nprimary structures.\nCrack initiation resistance and fracture resistance should be considered as complementa\nobjectives.\nBy virtue of its complex nature and varied operational regimes, an airframe\nencounters a wide variety of natural and induced environments. While this makes the\napplication of fracture theory a rather difficult task, the general overall goals which must\nbe achieved are rather simply stated, as follows:\n444\n\n(1) Encourage the intelligent selection of fracture-resistant materials, manufacturing processes, and so forth\n(2) Provide an incentive to design for inspectability with damage-resistant\nstructural configurations (i.e., multiple load paths)\n(3) Aid in establishing effective and realistic inspection procedures\n(4) Assist in selecting and controlling safe operating stresses\nIn the Materials Utilization section, materials data were presented to illustrate how\nstrength-density ratio (efficiency) could result in the selection of material with an undesirable level of toughness. Likewise, the choice based on fatigue alone might lead to\nserious difficulty since many high-strength materials (steels, for example) may have\nacceptable fatigue resistance but possess low resistance to brittle fracture and subcritical\nflaw growth (stress corrosion cracking, for example).\nStructural configurations which possess multiple load paths, crack stoppers, and so\nforth, are necessary and desirable; however, their ability to function and meet specific\npreassigned goals must be demonstrated early in design.\nControlling design stress levels for common structural materials can have untold\nbenefits from both the strength and fatigue points of view and can prevent costly field\nmaintenance problems. For example, multiple load path, redundant, and fail-safe\narrangements may effectively prevent the loss of aircraft, so long as adequate and frequent inspections are planned. The sole dependence on the fail-safe approach to achieving fracture control without regard to limiting design stresses may result in frequent\nmember failures, costly unscheduled maintenance, and aircraft downtime. This situation\ncan be alleviated by requiring each member in the multiple or redundant set to be inherently resistant to flaw growth within prescribed bounds (i.e., it must have a safe life with\ncracks).\nThe ability to detect and quantify flaws and cracks, both in the raw product form\nand the final assembled structural article, remains as the most significant measure in\ndeterring catastrophic fracture. Instituting fracture control procedures is, in fact, a\nfrank admittance that serious flaws can and often do go undetected. This fact was\ndramatically pointed out by Packman, Pearson, Owens, and Young (ref. 17) in a study for\nthe Air Force Materials Laboratory. The data in figure 11 have been obtained from that\nreport and depict the sensitivity and reliability of common NDI methods in controlled\nlaboratory experiments. The results are quite surprising because relatively large flaws\nwere not detected. This does not mean that all hope is lost of improving present methods\nand procedures. On the contrary, continued development of improved NDI techniques is\nmandatory.\n\n445\n\nFracture control procedures are most beneficial if effectively implemented and\nmanaged. Implementation consists of satisfying specific requirements for analysis and\ntest based on established ground rules and definitions of required strength, assumed\ndamage, service life, and inspection intervals. A balanced design within the goals of\ndamage tolerance is thus insured. It is important that the basic definitions, goals, and\nfracture requirements be established early in the design phase in order to impact trade\nstudies. Implementation requires a firm material data base, knowledge of operational\nenvironments, design criteria, and an analytical capacity to perform complex flaw-growth\nand strength analyses.\nIf fracture control procedures are instituted early, they form a portion of the basic\ndesign criteria and no weight penalties can then be attributed to their existence. Weight\npenalties are only recognized if the requirements are levied after the design is frozen.\nFRACTURE CONTROL \xe2\x80\x94 REQUIREMENTS\nIt should be acknowledged that the preparation of detailed step-by-step requirements for fracture control is a difficult task because of the numerous classes of aircraft\n(i.e., fighter bombers, trainers, etc.) in use today by the Air Force and because of the\nvarious types of structural arrangements which comprise these airframes. With regard\nto the structural aspects, the term "Damage Tolerant" is perhaps most common and is\nused within the Air Force (ref. 13) to describe those configurations "which will minimize\nthe loss of aircraft due to the propagation of undetected flaws, cracks, or other damage."\nSupplemental requirements for the ASIP (ref. 13) and various military specifications (ref. 18) are currently being formulated to insure the achievement of damagetolerant design. Such requirements will be applicable to all primary structures, the\nfailure of which would reduce the strength level below specified limits and endanger the\nsafe operational flight characteristics of the aircraft.\nIn general, requirements to insure adequate fracture control take on the form of\nspecific directives in the areas of (1) design, (2) analysis, and (3) test.\nIn the following discussion, a representative set of specifications for fracture control is described to indicate the relative levels of importance placed on structural\narrangements, inspections, and so forth.\nIt is generally recognized that there are two major design steps which are required\nto produce a damage-tolerant structure:\n(1) Controlled safe flaw growth (safe life with cracks)\n(2) Positive damage containment (remaining or residual strength)\n446\n\nNeither of these should be considered separate and distinct, however, since it is the\njudicious combination of both that is required for effective fracture control.\nSince the assumption is made that flaws do exist in new structures and can go\nundetected, full compliance with this philosophy requires that consideration be given to\nthe probability that flaws will exist in any and/or all members, including each element of\na redundant or multiple load path group. This is important because it is easy to rationalize that each member of the multiple set could be flawed. For example, if stress corrosion is responsible for the existence of subsurface cracks in one member, there is no\nassurance that each adjoining member does not contain cracks of a similar character.\nThe first major requirement for fracture resistance must, therefore, dictate that any\nmember must have a safe life with assumed cracks present.\nFor any given application, the overriding factors which govern the details and complexity of the fracture requirements and demonstrations are (fig. 12)\n(1) The class or type of structure\n(2) The quality of production and assembly NDl\n(3) The accessibility of the structure\n(4) The assurance that the member will be inspected in service\n(5) The probability that a flaw of subcritical size would go undetected even though\nperiodic inspections are made\nMost structural members can be classified by load path (fig. 13):\n(1) Single load path\n(2) Single primary load path with auxiliary crack arrest features\n(3) Multiple and redundant load path\nClass 2 includes such items as pressure cabins and pressure vessels, where relatively large amounts of damage may be contained by providing tear straps, stiffeners,\nand the like. While some load shedding does take place, the primary load path is singular.\nDetection of damage for such cases is likely, because of fuel or pressure leakage.\nClass 3 structures are generally designed so that some percentage of original\nstrength is retained during and subsequent to the failure of one element (often called fail\nsafe). Assurance of this capability should be mandatory by analysis and tests. The containment of damage is often produced by natural barriers such as production splices and\nso forth.\nAccessibility and inspectability were indicated in the section on Basic Considerations for Fracture Control as major items in fracture control. This point cannot be\n447\n\noveremphasized. Not only should the structure be inspectable, but assurance must be\ngiven that it will be inspected periodically after assembly. Because of recent experiences with high-strength materials, speculation has arisen whether or not subsurface\ncracks of near-critical size can be found in service by use of routine inspection procedures and equipment. A positive criterion such as "leak before break" may have to be\nlevied in order to assure their detection. Otherwise, an inspectable structure would\nhave to be classified as noninspectable. (See fig. 14.)\nEngineering Criteria \xe2\x80\x94 Definitions\nBefore specific fracture requirements for design, analysis, and test can be levied,\ncertain aspects of loading and service must be defined for each type of aircraft. In most\ncases, these items will be unique for each particular system and will be specified in the\nbasic design criteria.\nStrength limits.- The percentage of unflawed static strength which is to be maintained with prescribed amounts of damage must be established. This load is generally\nthe limit load but may vary with aircraft types.\nDynamic factors.- The effect of dynamic load amplification due to the release of\nenergy as the damage is introduced must be included.\nInspection intervals.- Inspection intervals shall be consistent with required safe\ncrack growth intervals and the requirements for residual strength.\nDamage limits.- The size of initial flaws which may be expected to slip by inspection must be established from NDI capability studies. Final damage limits will be based\non fracture and inspection requirements. In addition, the number and locations of members which are to be considered failed for residual strength purposes must be identified.\nDamage limits should be established for each system based on individual requirements,\nmaterials applications, and so forth.\nDesign Trade Study Analyses\nA primary function of the fracture control requirements during early design stages\nis to assist in the selection of damage-resistant materials and structures, with some\nincentive offered to those that are easily inspectable and those that include multiple or\nredundant load paths. In figure 15, key factors which influence these trade studies are\nsummarized. Each member is first classified as to structural type, inspectability, and\nso forth, and a candidate material is selected. Limits of assumed initial damage size\nare assigned together with the engineering criteria for life, strength, and final damage\nsize. The analysis is then performed by utilizing the appropriate cyclic and sustained\nloads and environments. The process is then iterated until a satisfactory combination\n448\n\nof material and stress level is selected which fulfills the strength and life requirements.\nThe resultant information is then incorporated with other design considerations until a\nsatisfactory design is achieved.\nAnalysis \xe2\x80\x94 Detailed Requirements\nThe analysis consists of determining the growth rates of initial flaws under cyclic\nloading and environment and insuring that these flaws remain subcritical for the specified\ntime period. Initial flaw sizes generally reflect the NDI capability but may be influenced\nby such criteria as proof tests and manufacturing processes. The flaws are generally\nassumed to be normal to the maximum principal stress field. The character and shape\nof the flaws are usually influenced by such aspects as\n(1) Materials and processing\n(2) Manufacturing and assembly\n(3) Handling and service conditions\nExperience has indicated that the flaw types shown in figure 16 are most representative\nin aircraft.\nIn table III, a set of hypothetical analysis requirements have been tabulated for the\nthree classes of structures, based upon whether or not the assemblies will be inspected\nin service. l The information from table III has been translated into figures 17, 18,\nand 19 for clarity. As is indicated, each class is designed for a safe crack growth period\nfrom an initial flaw. The final fracture dimensions are governed by plane strain fracture\nat limit load unless conditions indicate that this mode of fracture is unlikely. Some\nmotivation to design with inspectability and with high-toughness materials (and thus\nhigher stresses) is offered for (a 3 > a5) and (a4 > a5). The final crack dimensions a3\nand a4 must truly be detectable however; otherwise, the structure should be reclassified as noninspectable. It was previously stated that subsurface flaws most likely should\nbe put in the noninspectable class (for service inspections). However, in most cases, it\nis possible to achieve through-the-thickness cracks and thus "positive detection" with\nproper selection of materials and stresses.\nA safe life period of two inspection intervals has been indicated for the class 1 and\nclass 3 inspectable cases. This will result in a slight reduction in allowable design\nstresses but will offer more chance to detect the subcritical crack.\nFor the class 1, single load path, structure the requirement to satisfy a safe life\nwith cracks is easily accepted because of the consequence of losing the member.\n1 These requirements are presented for purpose of illustration only and do not\nrepresent USAF policy.\n449\n\nHowever, as previously stated, the preexistent flaw concept requires that all members,\nincluding each member of a multiple load set, be assumed flawed. It is not sufficient\nsimply to design the multiple load path structure to a remaining strength criterion with\none principal member failed. This does not insure that initial flaws in a member will\nnot grow to critical size in a relatively short period of time and result in broken members and unscheduled, costly maintenance. Therefore, the safe life requirements C and\nE as listed in table III and indicated in figure 18 are applicable to every member of the\nstructure. However, since there should be some incentive to design class 3 structures,\nthe size of the initial assumed flaws in the class 3 structure is reduced from that in the\nclass 1 structure for the noninspectable case (a 1 < a2). By doing this, the designer is\nadmitting that the design is more comfortable and that he is willing to take a larger risk\nof operating with cracks.\nSupplemental safe life (with cracks) requirements (F and G) for the class 3 structure are listed in table III and are applicable to the remaining structure after the one\nprincipal member has failed. In these requirements, the assumption is made that the\nelement could fail at any time during the life (or inspection period) and go undetected.\nThe remaining structure (assumed to be flawed) would then be required to carry the maxi\nmum load for the duration of the remaining specified time period. The stresses which\nresult from requirements F and G most likely will dominate the design. In actual practice, studies would have to be conducted to determine the most appropriate time to\nassume the member failure. In requirement F, the remaining growth period would be\none inspection interval regardless of when the member was assumed to have failed. As\nis indicated in figure 19, the total growth in any one member is equal to the amount which\noccurs prior to the failure of the principal element plus the amount which occurs subsequent to the failure at an increased stress level.\nAlternate Scheme to Assess Remaining Life\nIn the previous section, requirements F and G (table III) were presented to satisfy\nthe requirement for some remaining life in the multiple load structure after the failure\nof any principal member. An alternate scheme, and one which may be less restrictive,\nhas recently been prepared for use in the Air Force. The principal difference is that\nthe remaining structure is considered to be intact (unflawed) subsequent to the failure of\nthe principal element. The requirement is stated as follows in reference 18:\n" Fail Safe. Primary structure that is designed fail safe shall be readily inspectable and meet the following requirements after failure of a principal\nstructural element: (1) the remaining structure shall sustain without failure,\nthe maximum expected load or limit load, whichever is greater, (2) the airplane shall be controllable within the design speed limits, and (3) catastrophic\n450\n\nfailure of the remaining structure will not occur under repeated load conditions during the time period to the next opportunity to detect the failure.\nVerification of the ability of the remaining structure to withstand the\nrepeated loads shall be accomplished by determining the crack growth\nperiod from an initial flaw to failure of the principal element, and then\ninsuring that the life (including a factor of four) of the remaining structure\nwill equal or exceed the time interval established for the next inspection.\nInspection intervals shall be as agreed to by the procuring agency . . ."\nFracture Control \xe2\x80\x94 Verification and Demonstration\nIn the preceding discussion, requirements for analysis were presented. In certain\ninstances, experimental verification or demonstration of compliance should be required.\nSafe crack growth tests (class 1 and class 3).- Although basic growth-rate data will\nbe generated to support analysis techniques, it is desirable to augment the constantamplitude tests with spectrum crack growth tests conducted on a meaningful flight-byflight basis. This is particularly true where reliance has been placed upon positive\ndetection by surface flaws penetrating the member thickness. In most cases, these\nexperiments can be conducted on representative coupons, or small specimens if stresses\nare well known. If the geometry is complex, it is more desirable to utilize prototype\ncomponent structure and run the growth tests in conjunction with the static or cyclic\npreproduction tests.\nDemonstration tests utilizing full-scale structures (i.e., complete aircraft) should\nnot be necessary since it is generally quite easy to duplicate localized conditions surrounding the crack tip.\nDamage arrest (class 2).- Demonstration of crack arrest capability and subsequent\ncyclic life should be required. These tests may be conducted on representative specimens or on the full-scale aircraft at the conclusion of the static or fatigue test. In most\ncases, critical damage is introduced mechanically to simulate service condition (battle\ndamage, etc.).\nEstablishment of Inspection Procedures\nAn additional function served by the safe crack growth analysis is the establishment of inspection procedures for an individual structure or for all members in the aircraft which are manufactured from the same material. The use of fracture analysis\nprocedures allows inspection or rejection with more confidence by classifying parts and\nregions within a part according to the required NDI sensitivity.\n\n451\n\nThe development of such an inspection procedure for a typical application is illustrated as follows. Spectrum crack growth information is plotted in figure 20(a) as a\nfunction of the initial crack size (only a0 is shown) for various degrees of spectrum\nseverity (maximum stress). In this example, the required safe growth period is N hours,\nand a0 is the largest crack size that can be tolerated for this material application. The\nmaximum expected spectrum stress is Q4 . NDI procedures must insure the reliable\ndetection of a 0 during fabrication and assembly.\nThis spectrum growth information is translated into more meaningful form in figure 20(b) where, for any level of design stress, the largest tolerable flaw which would\ngrow to failure in N hours is plotted. Rather than using fracture at N hours, a\ncriterion based on positive detection could be substituted and produce a similar diagram.\nApplication of Requirements\nWhile the full impact of the proposed fracture requirements can only be assessed\nthrough an extensive design application study on an existing system, the relative severity\ncan be assessed by studying typical examples. The following example illustrates the\nvalues of design stress for a single material which would result under each requirement\nlisted in table III:\nExample: Tension cover; aircraft type, fighter\n\nMaterial, 7075-T6\nKIc = 30 ksi- in.\nThickness = 0.375 in.\nInitial flaw assumptions (surface flaw) (a/2c = 0.5):\na l = 0.050 in. (for all inspectable cases)\na2 = 0.150 in. (for all noninspectable cases)\nFinal flaw size:\na4 = Minimum detectable size = 0.375 in.\na3 = Minimum acceptable equivalent = 0.500 in. for single load\npath structure\nStress information:\nThe fighter spectrum information is contained in table IV in\nterms of a unit of maximum stress value a = 37 ksi. These occurrences in table IV are the equivalent of 40 hours of flight. The maximum limit stress for design purposes is:\nUL = 1.5Q = 55.5 ksi\n452\n\nSpectrum growth-rate data:\nBy utilizing constant-amplitude growth-rate data (ref. 19), the\nCRACKS computer routine (ref. 20), and the AFFDL crack growth\nretardation model (ref. 10), the stress spectrum (table IV) was\ntranslated into plots of crack depth a as a function of number of\nflights starting with an initial crack length a l = 0.050 in. (fig. 21)\nand a 2 = 0.150 in. (fig. 22). All levels of stress from table IV were\nincreased or decreased proportionally to achieve the variation in\ngrowth due to spectrum severity.\nMaterial toughness:\nThe cutoff line for KIc = 30 ksi- in, is indicated in figures 21\nand 22. The effect of varying this parameter was not investigated in\nthis example.\nLife requirement:\nService life = 160 blocks = 160 x 40 = 6400 hours. Inspection\nintervals are planned each 1/4 lifetime of 40 blocks = 1600 hours.\nRequirement A:\nInitial crack depth:\nal = 0.050 in.\nFinal crack depth:\na3 = 0.500 in. (based on positive detection)\nLife requirement:\nNA = 80 blocks = Two inspection intervals\nDesign stress QA:\nThis goal cannot be achieved with this material since K Ic is\nlimited to 30 ksi-in, and the inspection requirement of 0.500 in. is\nnot possible. A material change would most likely be required.\nRequirement C:\nInitial crack depth:\na1 = 0.050 in.\nFinal crack depth:\na4 = 0.375 in. (based on positive detection)\n\n453\n\nLife requirement:\nNC = 80 blocks\nDesign stress, maximum:\n0C (allowable) = 1.270 = 47 ksi\nRequirement D:\nInitial crack depth:\na2 = 0.150 in.\nLife requirement:\nND = 160 blocks = One lifetime\nFinal crack depth:\na 5 = Plane strain fracture > 1.0 in.\nDesign stress, maximum:\n0D (allowable) = 0.810 = 31 ksi\nRequirement E:\nInitial crack depth:\nal = 0.050 in.\nFinal crack depth:\na 5 = Plane strain fracture = 0.58 in.\nLife requirement:\nNE = 160 blocks\nDesign stress, maximum:\n0E (allowable) = 1.080 = 40 ksi\nRequirement F:\n\nCoupled with requirement C is the additional requirement that the structure remaining after failure of the principal member will be capable of carrying limit load for one additional inspection period, or 1/4 lifetime. The lower\nportion of the growth data from figure 21 has been replotted in figure 23.\n(a) Assume that the member breaks accidentally after the first flight and\nremains undetected until the next inspection interval. The stress is assumed\nto increase by 20 percent, with the requirement being no failure at limit load in\n1/4 lifetime or 40 blocks. From figure 23, it can be seen that a stress level\n454\n\nof approximately 1.6Q = 60 ksi would grow to failure in 40 blocks.\nTherefore\naFa (allowable) = 160 0 = 50 ksi\n(b) Assume the member failure to be at 1/4 lifetime (just subsequent\nto inspection). The crack in the remaining structure has grown an amount\nDa during the first inspection period. Thus,\nNew initial a = al + Da = 0.050 + Aa\nThis condition can be satisfied by trial and error by using figure 23. The\nresult indicates that crFb z 1.2a = 44.4 is appropriate for this condition.\nFailure at any other time could be checked to see whether a lower stress\nwould result. Note that no criterion for positive detection was required\nsince at the next inspection the broken member would be found.\nRequirement G:\n\nIn a similar manner, requirement E should be checked for life after\nmember failure.\n(a) Assume failure on first flight (from fig. 21)\nQ\n\nE =1.08Q=40 ksi\nQ\n\n" gG\n\na 12-33.3 ksi\n\n(b) Assume failure at 1/2 lifetime. The incremental growth during the\nfirst 1/2 lifetime must be added to a l . The requirement for 1/2 remaining\nlife shall then be determined. From figure 21, by trial and error, a stress\nlevel of uGb = 1.Ou = 37.0 ksi is seen to satisfy the requirements.\nSummary:\nThe following table is a summary of the previous example:\nRequirement\t\n\nDesign stress, Q, ksi\t\n\nCondition\n\nA\nC\nD\nE\nFa\nFb\nGa\nGb\n\nNot satisfied\n47\n31\n40\n50\n44.4\n33.3\n37.0\n\nInspectable class 1\nInspectable class 3\nNoninspectable class 1\nNoninspectable class 3\nInspectable class 1\nNoninspectable class 3\n455\n\nThe results clearly indicate the advantages offered by designing for inspectability\nsince the allowable stresses for requirements C and F are greater than for requirement G. The incentive for multiple, in lieu of single, load path design is seen in the\nresultant allowable design stresses for requirements E and G being greater than for\nrequirement D.\nANALYSIS AND DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION\nThe successful implementation of the fracture control analysis requires the analytical capability for cyclic and environmental flaw growth, aircraft usage information,\nand basic strength and fracture data for proposed candidate materials.\nCriteria Requirements\nInitial considerations for fracture resistance and control of subcritical flaw growth\nmust be established during the criteria development stage and must reflect appropriate\nchemical, thermal, and operational loads environments. For example, recent materials\nusage has necessitated the generation of data on sustained-load flaw growth in aggressive\nenvironments such as fuel and water (fig. 24(a)). Because loading rate and dwell times\nare important in the assessment of environmental effects, it has become important also\nto generate load-time spectra of the type indicated in figure 24(b).\nMaterial Data Requirements\nThe major material strength and fracture properties required to perform the ana\nlyses and trade studies for fracture considerations are illustrated in figure 25. In all\ncases (except KIc) no approved standard test methods exist to determine these properties. Through experience, however, various test techniques and specimens have evolved.\n(See fig. 25.) As is often the case, a specimen developed for one function or application\nis used to generate a multitude of data. Testing techniques and data interpretation may\nmask important material responses or indicate false reaction to stress and environment.\nFor example, in a recent comparison of cyclic growth-rate behavior in D6ac steel\n(refs. 9, 11, and 12) comparative growth rates obtained from compact tension and surfaceflawed specimens indicated a predominant stress-level effect for the surface-flawed\nspecimen, whereas no clear dependency was observed for the compact tension case\n(fig. 26). These effects are currently being investigated.\nFracture Analysis Methods\nPrediction of fracture and growth behavior requires a means of translating external\napplied loads into stresses in the region of the crack tip. Finite-element techniques\n456\n\noffer a vast potential in the area, particularly in complex structural arrangements\n(refs. 21 and 22). A rather broad collection of stress intensity solutions exists (ref. 4);\nhowever, their use is limited in many cases and extrapolation is often required to provide the best estimate of K.\nConsiderable effort is being expended in the development of computer routines to\n"integrate" growth-rate (da/dN) data (ref. 20), for example, and to account for the retardation effect of overloads in variable-amplitude spectra. As an example of this type of\nactivity, the AFFDL has recently developed a mathematical model for predicting the\ngrowth delay effect (ref. 10). The basic model is concerned with the effect of the overload plastic zone on the subsequent rate of growth as indicated in figure 27. A hypothetical residual or reduction stress is then computed which suppresses the subsequent cyclic\nloads. Retardation is accomplished in three modes, depending on the relative size of the\noverload in relation to the subsequent cyclic level (fig. 28). Effective OK and R\nvalues are computed and reduced rates obtained from normal da/dN and OK relationships. Note that growth can be completely stopped (fig. 28). An extensive testing program is being completed at AFFDL to evaluate the merit of the model. In figure 29 are\nsome early correlations with single overloads in aluminum (ref. 6). Fairly good correlation is noted also with randomized block spectrum data for D6ac steel (fig. 30).\nGrowth analysis schemes need to be extended to include the effects of loading rate\nand delay time (sustained load growth). Free surface effects and flaw shape changes,\nincluding the transition of a surface flaw to a through crack, must be included.\nSUGGESTED AREAS OF STUDY\nThe suggested areas of study for the application of fracture mechanics in structural integrity have been summarized and are presented as table V. This table is\nobtained from reference 23.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS AND RECOMMENDED TOPICS FOR STUDY\nThe author has attempted to present the significant impact of fracture mechanics\nand fracture control in the overall program of airframe structural integrity. The true\nweight, cost, and performance trade-offs associated with the implementation of these or\nany requirement can best be judged by experience and application to existing systems.\nA fair assessment can only occur, however, if continued materials and structures development efforts are directed toward upgrading existing fracture mechanics and fracture\nanalysis technology.\n\n457\n\nThe author has summarized in tabular form a rather extensive "shopping list" of\nitems which require attention. In many cases, a relatively high degree of proficiency\nexists and application experience is all that is necessary while others require new\nthought and new direction.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. Donaldson, D.

Brangex\nEidgenossisches Flugzeugwerk\nEmmen, Switzerland\nSUMMARY\nRectangular specimens of 7075 and 2014 aluminum alloys with two holes (stress\nconcentration factor of 3.24) have been tested under axial fatigue loading on a sixrod test bed with modifications of the loading program, the surface particulars, and\nthe frequency. The length of the precrack stage was investigated by use of a new\ncrack detector.\nIn most cases the two alloys behaved similarly, with similar life to crack start\nunder the same loading. Some overloads lengthened the life. Truncation by omission\nof the lowest peak loads should be limited to about 20 percent of the ultimate load.\nSimplifying counting methods gave misleading results. Very thin surface layers of\nanodizing, protection by vinyl, dry nitrogen atmosphere, as well as stepwise reaming\nor grinding the surface of the holes, lengthened the life; thick anodized layers shortened the life. Compressing the hole surface by rolling had no influence. Frequencies\nat about 210 to 240 cpm produced shorter lives than those at 40 cpm. At 5.4 cpm the\nlife was considerably longer. A model to better understand the precrack-stage fatigue\nmechanism is discussed.\nINTRODUCTION\nFatigue test programs are usually designed to fit available test installations.\nSince the capability of most test facilities is limited, such test programs have to be\nsimplified. The genuine sequence of the loading occurring in real flight usually has to\nbe neglected. The influence of this neglect and also the influence of blocking cycles\non the result of a fatigue test cannot be calculated by present methods nor can it be\nestimated because of many gaps in the knowledge of the fatigue mechanism. The need\nto remove these restrictions by appropriate tests is obvious. Test series considering\nthe effect of variation of one or two parameters can help to find explanations of the\nfatigue mechanism or can at least prove whether proposed theories are possible or\nnot.\nFigure 1 represents a survey of the investigation of the influence of program\nmodifications on the fatigue life of light alloy specimens. This paper is especially\n485\n\ndealing with the precrack stage of a specimen representing safe-life aircraft elements\nmachined from bars and plates. Also, the crack-propagation life is considered to some\nextent.\nLoading history which does not neglect the genuine sequence of the loads seems to\nbe the only test approach to solve the problem. Moreover, since full loading history programs take a long time to run, means to shorten them without influencing the life to failure should be evaluated.\nSYMBOLS\nA\t\n\nchemical affinity\n\na\t\n\nindex for arithmetical\n\nb\t\n\nindex for probable, or for bending\n\nC\t\n\ncrack-stage length, C = F - P\n\nN\n\na l ,b l ,c 2 ,c 3\tmaterial, surroundings, and loading parameters\nc\'\t\n\nquasi-cycle (asymmetric)\n\nD\t\n\ndamage\n\nD\'\t\n\namount of damage produced by R\', that is, by the effective amount of reaction\nper cycle\n\nD"\t\n\namount of damage produced by R", that is, by the reaction of one half-cycle\n\ne\t\n\neccentricity\n\nF\t\n\nlife to failure (number of cycles, flights or periods)\n\nf\t\n\nfunction\n\nfi\t\n\nflight number\n\nfq\t\n\nflight number per period\n\n486\n\nfs\t\n\nscatter factor, F50\nP99.9\n\nHq\t\n\nnumber of quasi-cycles of one period\n\nI\t\n\nintensity of incitation of chemical activity, I = f(v) \xe2\x80\xa2 f(s)\n\ni\t\n\nindex for number of cycle, flight or period\n\nK1\nK2\t\n\nstress concentration factors, calculated by RAS Data Sheets\n\nL\t\n\nload\n\nLq\t\n\nhighest peak load in one period\n\nN\t\n\nnumber (of cycles, flights or periods)\n\nn\t\n\nnumber of specimen; index for nominal\n\nP\t\n\nlife to the end of the precrack stage, that is, to crack start (number of cycles,\nflights or periods)\n\np\t\n\nduration of reaction = persistence (time)\n\nq\t\n\nperiod, index for period\n\nR\t\n\nreaction (chemical)\n\nR\'\t\n\neffective amount of reaction per cycle\n\nR"\t\n\namount of reaction in one half-cycle\n\nS\t\n\nstrain, range of strain\nn\t\n\ns\t\n\n]1,2\n(log Ni - log N)2\n\nempirical standard deviation s = n 1 1\t\ni=1\n\ns\t\n\ns for the number of periods up to failure\n487\n\ns\t\n\ns for the number of periods up to the end of the precrack stage, that is, up\nto crack start\n\nt\t\n\ntime\n\nu\t\n\nindex for ultimate\n\nv\t\n\nrate of straining, dS/dt\n\ny\t\n\nprobability of survival\n\nz\t\n\nelectrical resistance\n\n0\t\n\nlowest considered load step\n\nV\t\n\nrate of reaction (chemical), f (I \xe2\x80\xa2 AA)\n\na\t\n\nstress, load per unit of area\n\ncp\t\n\nfunction of\n\t\n\nP\n11x\n\nordinate values for the third asymptotic extremal distribution (Smirnow)\n\n0\t\n\nchemical resistance\n\nW\t\n\nfrequency of cycles\nA bar over a symbol denotes a mean value.\nMEANS AND METHODS\n\nThe means and methods used by the Swiss Federal Aircraft Establishment (called\nF + W) for the investigation and evaluation of the influence of program modifications\ninvolve a six-rod test bed, a crack detector, test rods, fatigue loading history, and probable mean and scatter. For test specimens which are not too large, this problem can be\ninvestigated on the six-rod fatigue test bed (fig. 2), developed and built by F + W (ref. 1),\nbecause this facility is capable of simulating the genuine sequence of loads up to 8 tons\nfor each specimen. A structural component of a shape commonly used in aircraft,\nalready mentioned in reference 2, was chosen as the test specimen (fig. 3). It is a\nslightly eccentric, axially loaded, notched specimen of rectangular cross section. A\n488\n\nbetter insight into the behaviour of fatigue is due to the crack detector (figs. 4 and 5), also\ndeveloped by F + W and operational since 1969 (ref. 3).\nFigure 6 defines fatigue loading history, that is, a loading in which all actual service\nloads essential for fatigue are applied in their genuine sequence, magnitude, and frequency, and only rest times and steady loads are omitted. Figure 7 presents the symbols\nand also explains how the results of the tests are evaluated. Since six test specimens,\neach with two identical notches, are run simultaneously, each run is giving the scatter of\n12 precrack stages and the scatter of the crack-propagation life of the faster growing\ncrack in each specimen. As Freudenthal (ref. 4) explained, it is the time to the first failure which is important, especially for safe-life elements. Therefore, all the tests are\nevaluated in the manner presented in figure 7. The log-extremal paper was devised by\nSmirnow (ref. 5). Moreover, figure 7 defines the scatter factor.\nThe properties of the investigated 7075 and 2014 light alloys are presented in figure 8. The 2014 alloy plate was delivered in the prestretched (2 percent) condition. The\ntest specimens machined from this plate were fully heat treated after they were machined.\nThe main data of the loading programs are listed in table I.\nThe investigation has four main considerations: influence of omission of low loads\nand addition of overloads (group A), influence of different counting methods (group B),\ninfluence of surface particulars (group C), and influence of frequency (group D). A survey\nof the test-run numbers is given in figure 9.\nINVESTIGATIONS\nGroup A\nThe aim of group A (fig. 10) is to disclose the influence of omitting the lowest load\nsteps, as well as the influence of adding some overloads (fig. 11). The history program\napplied is the VENOM Program (ref. 6) consisting of 350 flights; the full program is\ncalled VENOM Program II. By omitting the smallest air and ground loads, program XIV\nwas deduced from program II. In similar manner, programs XV (only the smallest air\nloads omitted) and XVI (only the smallest ground loads omitted) were deduced from program II. On the proposal of Hooke of ARL in Melbourne, program XVII was deduced from\nprogram XIV by omitting the next smallest air and ground loads, whereas program XVIII\nwas deduced from program II by addition of some high peak loads exceeding the design\nlimit load. At each fifth period an overload of 107.5 percent and at the tenth period one of\n115 percent were applied. All these programs strictly observe the genuine load sequence\nin all 350 flights.\n\n489\n\nFigure 12 presents the results of the investigations of group A. The data are listed\nin tables II and III.\nGroup B\nThere is still much speculation about the influence of different counting methods of\nthe occurring fatigue loads on the fatigue life. Group B (fig. 13) is aiming to clear this.\nAlthough programs V\' and VI\' are deduced directly from program II by counting the peaks\nbetween the mean level crossings (these are the +lg level for V\' and the zero-g level for\nVI\'), LBF at Darmstadt composed two new programs: program XX by counting program II\nwith the "level crossing" method and program XXI with the "range pair" method defined by\nSchijve (ref. 7), both furthermore pooling positive and negative peak loads and grouping the\nsame cycles within each flight into blocks. This is represented on the right side of figure 13 by the hatching. The ground loads had to be presented separately.\nMore of the character of these program modifications is visible in figure 14. The\ndifferences from the basic program are evident.\nFigure 15 and table IV present the results of group B, in which some comparative\ntests for specimens which were taken transversely from the plate were also included.\nGroup C\nOn the basis of a hypothesis proposed by Schaub (ref. 8) in 1955, the investigation\nproject was completed by considering the influence of surface particulars. Figure 16 and\ntable V give a survey of this test series and the results. Anodic surface treatments are\nvery widely applied where cladding is not possible. Their influence on fatigue is not sufficiently known. It was decided to test surface-layer thicknesses of about 20 \xc2\xb5 and 6 \xc2\xb5\nfor anodic oxidation in sulfuric acid and 3 to 4 \xc2\xb5 for the anodic oxidation in chromic acid,\nknown as the BF 4 procedure (a better defined version of Bengough). In most cases these\ntreatments are applied before the holes are reamed; the same procedure was followed for\nthese test specimens. It is of rather academic interest to hinder the chemical activity by\na thin protective layer of vinyl as it is used to protect transistors or to lower the chemical\naffinity by an artificial atmosphere of commercially available dry nitrogen.\nSimilar to the tests of Schaub, test runs 69 and 71 were performed in such a manner that from time to time the holes 6.0 mm in diameter of the test rod were reamed or\nground in steps of 0.1-mm diameter, up to five times, to a final diameter of 6.5 mm.\nAlthough by this procedure the net area was reduced by 2.5 percent and the stress concentration factor was increased from 3.24 to 3.30, the last crack started only at 115.2 periods on the reamed specimen and at 195.8 periods on the ground specimen (compared with\n40.1 periods for the last crack start of those specimens which were reamed only once to\na diameter of 6.0 mm). Therefore, to find the reason for the end of the precrack stage,\n490\n\none needs to look only in the surface layer. This result confirms the findings of many\nauthors. The very long life of the last three specimens after the last grinding is difficult\nto explain. Perhaps the workman did his job with extraordinary care because he knew\nwhat was expected and then produced a surface of higher quality than before.\nNo gain resulted from rolling the hole, notwithstanding the fact that it was made by\na specialist.\nGroup D\nThe frequency effect on the fatigue life is still debated. It is therefore necessary\nto investigate its influence. Figure 17 and table VI present the results.\nOn a chain test bed 36 test rods of the same design were fatigue loaded parallel and\nsimultaneously with the full-scale fatigue tests of three VENOM aircraft. The loading\nprogram I differs from program II only by those orders which were needed for the fullscale test; the loads, their sequence, and their number were exactly the same as with program II on the six-rod test bed. Both test beds are in the same room. The only differences were the frequency, 5.4 cpm (this test lasted years\'), and the shape of the cycles\n(figo 18). As an intermediate frequency to 210 or 240 cpm, 40 cpm was selected because\nit can be run on the six-rod test bed and at the same strain rate as for 210 or 240 cpm.\n\n2\n\nFor program II the increasing (56 and 340 percent) life with decreasing frequency\nfrom 240 cpm to 40 cpm and 5.4 cpm is remarkable. Another comparison test was run\nwith program XX, once with 96 cpm and once with 173 cpm. The opposite behavior is\nnoteworthy.\nPRECRACK STAGE\nStudent\'s test was used to determine the significance of the difference indicated in\nthe tables by the ratio of the precrack-stage lives P 50 . The probability levels for the\ndifferences considered are listed in table VII. Levels of about 90 percent or higher indicate a significant difference; lower ones may indicate a trend, whereas very low levels\nindicate that the modification had no influence on the life. In some cases the actual thickness of the anodized layer must be taken into account and in some cases also the fact that\nthe specimens were manufactured from different bars (as indicated by the test number).\nGenerally, table VII hints that the significance is higher for 2014 alloy. The reason is\nthe higher loading relative to the ultimate load.\nInfluence of Alloy\nThe test specimens of 7075 alloy, as well as those of 2014 alloy, were loaded to\nexactly the same absolute load values. Relative to the ultimate strength, the 2014 speci491\n\nmens were thus loaded about 33 percent higher than the 7075 specimens. Nevertheless,\nthe fatigue life of 2014 is only 19 percent shorter than that of 7075 (table VIII). This result\nconfirms the well-known fact that the fatigue strength of the different aluminum alloys is\nnearly independent of their static strength. By the way, a part of the difference may be\ncontributed to the 7075 specimens being machined from bars 15 by 60 mm, whereas the\n2014 specimens were cut in the longitudinal direction from plates 32 by 1220 by 2290 mm.\nThis also explains the slightly higher scatter for 2014.\nInfluence of Overloads\nAs expected and as reported and explained by many authors for program loading,\nthe overloads lengthened both stages (table II) but much more so with 2014. For this alloy\nthe relative overload (relative to the ultimate strength) was much higher: The highest\npeak load applied (+6075 kp) is 53 percent of the nominal ultimate load for 7075 but 71 percent of that for 2014. Nevertheless, overloads should not be taken into account because\nnot all service aircraft experience them.\nInfluence of Omitting Cycles With the Lowest Peak Loads\nFor 7075 anodized to 20 \xc2\xb5 the omission of the lowest and the next lowest peak loads\n(table III) has no significant influence on the life although the number of cycles is reduced\nby 81 percent. It seems that a favourable effect is abolished by another, unfavourable\neffect. In contrast, 2014 suffers a decrease in lifetime of 45 percent when the lowest\npeaks are truncated but has an increase of 63 percent when the next lowest peaks are also\ntruncated. Relating programs XVII to )UV, this increase is as much as 195 percent. This\nincrease of life may be explained by the truncation of the positive peaks at a relative level\nof 27.5 percent (relative to the ultimate load), whereas truncation at a level of 20.5 percent\nwith 7075 has a slightly unfavourable effect. Taking into account the stress concentration\nfactor of 3.24, the level of 27.5 percent is just at the nominal 0.2 yield strength of 2014,\nwhereas the level of 20.5 percent is only at 77 percent of the nominal 0.2 yield strength\nof 7075. That is about the same for the lowest peak level omitted (program )UV) with 2014\n(75 percent of 0.2 yield strength) where the effect is on the same side but faster. For\nthese alloys, axial tension and compression, and a stress concentration factor of 3.24, the\ncritical limit thus lies between 20.5 and 27.5 percent. Omitting loads smaller than this\nlimit shortens the life, which seems to be very astonishing; whereas the omission of loads\ngreater than this limit lengthens the life, as is expected. The strange shortening effect\nmay be due to a recovery or a re-creation during the application of these lowest loads.\nThis very interesting effect will be discussed further, in connection with surface influences\nand frequency.\nBefore the crack detector type 02 was developed, tests were performed with the same\nspecimen and 7075 anodized to only 6 \xc2\xb5. For the arithmetical mean of six specimens, the\n492\n\nratio of program )UV to II was 0.89 at failure. Later tests on 2014 at a higher relative\nload level had a similar, more pronounced trend. The influence of omitting some of the\nground load cycles will be discussed subsequently.\nInfluence of Counting Methods\nThe important decrease in the life by counting by the level-crossing method (program XX) has to be attributed mainly to the pooling of positive and negative peak loads\ninto combined cycles. In the Swiss Review 1967 (ref. 1) a simplified test with the same\n7075 specimen for the investigation of the pooling effect was reported. The pooled program (VIII) had a life ratio of 0.43 to that of the nonpooled program (XI), which is very\nnear the ratios 0.34 for 7075 and 0.38 for 2014, when F 50 of program XX is compared\nwith F 50 of program II.\nThe order-of-magnitude longer life with the program designed by the range-pair\nmethod (program XX) has to be attributed to the diminution of all positive peak loads,\nalthough such a big difference was not expected. It is noteworthy that both alloys behave\nnearly identically. Therefore, both counting methods have to be rejected. The same has\nto be said of the mean-crossing-peak counting method if this mean is zero (program VI\')\nbecause this crude method omits too many cycles (fig. 14). The resulting increase of life\nwas expected but perhaps not by this amount. About the same increase is valuable for\nthe transversely machined 2014 specimens, as may be seen by comparing runs 100 and\n97 in table IX. By putting the mean mainly at +1 of the air loads, only the ground loads\nare concerned. This will be discussed subsequently.\nInfluence of Surface Particulars\nThe unfavourable effect of a thick 20-4 anodized surface layer, which is hard and\ncracks easily, thus forming stress raisers, is well known. The decrease of only 30 percent is even less than expected by many people. In contrast, the important favourable\neffect of a thin anodized layer was not expected, certainly not by this amount. It may be\nthat these thin layers are so elastic that they do not crack and hence fulfill their protective task. The influence of the thickness of the anodized layers was more important than\nhad been expected. Therefore, measurements of the layer thickness of all test specimens\nwere made after the tests. These measurements disclosed considerable differences in\nthe nominal thickness. By this way, a part of the scatter was better explained. The only\nprocedure which regularly gives the same thickness with a high reliability seems to be\nthe BF 4 process.\nThe smaller favourable effect of the vinyl protection may be due to low porosity,\nwhich also explains the greater scatter. The fact that the life in a nitrogen atmosphere\nwas only doubled (other authors reported much higher ratios) may be explained by the test\n493\n\nconditions: Commercially available dry nitrogen was used, the specimen was not cooled\ndown, and testing was at room temperature. But a very important fact has to be noted:\nBy simple chemical means the crack stage, as well as the precrack stage, can be lengthened considerably although the mechanical fatigue strengthening of the specimen is strictly\nthe same.\nRemoving about 0.05 mm of the surface layer, by reaming or grinding, confirms the\nwork of Schaub and his collaborators. The removal was accomplished by the same manner in which the hole was machined at the beginning. To avoid the effect of a further factor, the specimens were not electropolished. Although the crack detector was working\nperfectly, the removal procedure was made too late in some cases. Nevertheless, the\nincrease of the life of the last four ground specimens is extraordinary.\nIn contrast, the test with the surface compressive treatment by a rolling procedure\nwas disappointing. The main reason may be that the crack always starts at the edge of\nthe hole because the special shape of the test rod has a slight eccentricity. This reveals\nthe doubtful effect of treatments like this \xe2\x80\x94 doubtful because eccentricities are not completely avoidable in actual designs.\nInfluence of Frequency\nUp to now there have been only a few reports on tests with increasing life at decreasing frequency. A note from Schutz related Weller\'s (Dresden) work, who reports (ref. 9)\non both trends and who advocated in 1966 (ref. 10) that there must exist a frequencydependent minimum of life with increasing life in both directions, that is, by decreasing\nthe frequency and by increasing it from that minimum. Weller\'s assumption is obviously\nright, as will be discussed later.\nThere are three factors contributing to the frequency-dependent effect:\n1. The genuine corrosion of unstrengthened aluminum alloys (in the present test\nseries this influence may be neglected).\n2. The strain rate, which in most cases increases with increasing frequency. Test\nruns 67/68/73 and 64, 57, and 55 (table VI and fig. 18) eliminate this factor because the\nstrain rate is the same in all cases.\n3. The proper frequency effect. This one is of special interest and must be discussed in connection with other influences, for example, the influence of omitting cycles,\ncounting methods, and surface particulars.\nFor test run A (program I, fig. 18) the strain rate was greatly reduced. This test\nreflects the influence of two factors, which may explain the very long life.\n\n494\n\nThe opposite trend of test runs 57 and 55 is remarkable and may be attributed at\nfirst to the very different program and cycle shape. This difference seems to move the\nfrequency of the minimum of life to about 100 cpm, whereas for the loading history program shape this minimum lies at about 200 to 250 cpm.\nIn 1956 Wade and Grootenhuis (ref. 11) found that the life still increases if the frequency is increasing from 24 Hz to 3835 Hz (1440 to 230 000 cpm). But Wood and Mason\n(ref. 12) reported in 1968 and 1969 that by increasing the frequency from 1700 cpm to the\nultrasonic range of 17 000 Hz (1 million cpm), the life decreased considerably. Two new\nfactors (resonance and concentration in a few localities) are responsible for this result.\nThus, after the minimum proposed by Weller, there is a maximum, detected by Wood\nand Mason, at about 5000 times higher frequencies, as presented in figure 19. This downup-down configuration comes about by the effects of different factors which predominate\nin turn. This will be discussed by means of a model.\nInfluence of Compressive Loads\nIn these tests compressive loads are applied by ground loads and negative air loads.\nAs the latter are very few compared with the ground loads, the findings reflect the importance of the ground loads.\nTable X reveals opposite behaviour of 2014 and 7075 alloys. Program XVI, which\nomits all small ground load alterations (5 percent of ultimate load for 7075, 7 percent for\n2014), gives shorter lives than program II in all three 7075 comparison tests (21 to 16,\n76 to 67/68, and 104 to 92). This result is in accordance with the similar findings for\nprogram XIV for 7075. But in the 2014 comparison test the life with program XVI was\nlonger than that with program II (test runs 88 to 91), which is not in accordance with the\nresult of program XIV but with the result of program XVII. From this it may be deduced\nthat the limit for ground loads, the omission of which has a life-lengthening effect, lies\nbetween 5 and 7 percent of the ultimate load, whereas the same limit for tension loads\nlies between 20 and 27 percent (as discussed in the section on omitting cycles). This\nresult underscores the importance of compressive loads. The same trend of different\nbehaviour appears in program V\'.\nMaterial Flow\nBecause of the integral design of modern wing skins, thick plates are needed which\nare machined as a whole. These plates are stretched to about 2 percent before machining.\nThis procedure outweighs the effect of rolling the plates in respect to fatigue loading history, as can be seen in table IX. The time to failure is shorter only for the transversedirected material with program V\'. This result indicates a ground-load effect.\n495\n\nMODEL OF THE PRECRACK STAGE\nIn 1955 Schaub (ref. 13) put forward the following hypothesis: There must be two\nconditions for the start of a fatigue crack. One consists of the well-known physicalmechanical alterations due to fatigue loading; the other consists of a chemical reaction\nwith the surrounding medium, which is derived from observations made by Kramer,\nPepperhoff, and Churchill (ref. 13). On the same occasion it was mentioned that Gough\nand Sopwith, Weibull, Freudenthal, and others had found an important influence of the surrounding medium in classical constant-amplitude tests. Therefore, the inclusion of a\nchemical reaction for the explanation of the fatigue mechanism seems to be a more promising approach to clear the mystery of the precrack-stage fatigue mechanism than the\nphysical-mechanical aspect alone. With the results of the tests on two aluminum alloys,\nthis hypothesis may be refined by analysing a corresponding model of the first phase of\nfatigue damage, a scheme of which is presented in figure 20, and which may be called the\n"chemical phase."\n1. Stress is inflicting strain (with all the well-known rules, especially important are\nthose on the stress concentration factor and the residual stress originating from previous\nloadings (ref. 14)).\n2. Strain, that is, the strain rate and the range of uninterrupted application of the\nvariation of strain, is inciting chemical activity (apart from the well-known rules on the\nphysical effects) between both mediums. By the way, steady strain is often the reason for\nstress corrosion, which should not be confused with the following description.\n3. The intensity of incitation of this chemical activity, that is, the rate of reaction,\nis increasing with increasing strain rate and with increasing range.\n4. This rate of reaction is more lively the better the affinity of these two mediums\nis and the lower the chemical resistance is.\n5. The reaction may begin with a very short time delay after the inciting event but\ncontinues some time after it with decreasing intensity, like the persistence of a television\nscreen.\n6. The effect of this reaction is a new chemical product, most probably some composition between the two mediums concerned, that is, in most cases an oxide of the metal,\nin other words, damage.\n7. The very thin layer of the genuine product of their affinity, for example 4 to 9 angstroms (10- 10 m) of oxidation of aluminum alloys, does not hinder this activity if the inciting strain rate and range exceed a certain limit.\n\n496\n\n8. The (genuine) product produced at rest and the (artificial) product produced by\nstrain rate and range are probably of the same nature, but the quantity of the latter is by\nfar more rapidly increasing with continuing strain rate and range (called fatigue loading)\nthan the former at rest.\n9. Therefore, this accelerating (if not inciting at all) effect of the fatigue loading may\nbe compared with the catalysis. Fatigue loading is, so to say, a dynamic catalyst.\n10. This catalysis is producing an increasing thickness of the layer of the composition, for example, of the oxide, as long as fatigue loading continues.\n11. There is no reason for a decomposition at rest.\n12. The rate of increase in thickness will decrease with increasing thickness, as\nthis effect begins to hinder the activity because of its chemical resistance. The rate of\ndamage increase is thus decreasing. This is very important because a slowly increasing\namount of damage explains the big scatter in the precrack stage of fatigue life, as will be\nseen later.\nAfter this first phase of fatigue damage, a second phase, still in the precrack stage\nprobably follows, which may be imagined as follows:\n13. The layer of the new composition, for example this oxide layer has a Young\'s\nmodulus different from that of the underlying metal, also a different yield strength. It is\nprobably more brittle.\n14. If the thickness of the layer exceeds a certain limit (which itself depends on the\nthree-axial stress state), this layer may crack under a tension strain or form flakes under\na compressive strain.\n15. Those parts of the underlying metal, which are set free by these incidents and\nwhich get direct contact with the other medium, for example, with the atmosphere, will\nagain be chemically activated, and so on.\n16. Finally, the surface may get an aspect like the one which Wood (refs. 15 and 16)\nsaw by scanning electron microscopy and on which a fatigue crack is starting.\nThe second part of the precrack stage may therefore be called the flake phase and is\nschematically presented by figure 21. Both these phases, that is, the whole process, is\nin fact a corrosion by fatigue and may be called fatigue corrosion, in contrast to corrosion\nfatigue, where a relatively quick genuine corrosion exists (and thus facilitates the fatigue\ncorrosion). This definition differs somewhat from that given by McAdam (ref. 17), whose\nprocess "differs only in degree from stressless corrosion, but does not imply ordinary\nfatigue."\nMost of these explaining steps are more or less evident. Step 2 was supposed by\nSchaub (ref. 8) 16 years ago and then supported by others. Step 15 was mentioned in 1960\n497\n\nby Broom and Nicholson (ref. 18). They also assumed a relation between fatigue deformation and hydrogen diffusion. Step 16 was detected only one and a half years ago by Wood\n(refs. 15 and 16) The increased oxide layer thickness (step 10) remains to be shown.\nThe most important supposition is step 5, the time-delaying activity, because by this\npersistence of a chemical process, the frequency influence may be explained as displayed\nin figure 20(g): By increasing the frequency, the reaction initially increases because of\nthe not-yet-settled reaction of the preceding cycle; however, further increases in frequency decrease the relative damage per cycle. Obviously, together with step 3, the\nshape of the cycles (fig. 18) and their sequence are influencing the frequency at which the\nminimum life (fig. 19) is found; thus the seemingly opposite behaviour of programs II and\nXX is explained. Similar to figure 20(g) the omission of less effective, very low peaks\n(step 3) increases the value of the effective amount of reaction per cycle (and thus shortens\nthe precrack life), whereas the crack-stage length increases by this same omission as\nexpected (in table III compare test runs 74 with 73 and 86 with 91), thus supporting the\nhypothesis that the reason that the omission of the lowest peaks has a life-shortening\neffect originates entirely in the first damage phase.\nStep 7 may explain the endurance limit to some extent. Finally, the larger scatter\nof the precrack stage may be explained by figure 20(h), as outlined in step 12.\nThe ultrasonic frequency range is not mentioned in this model because other factors\nare predominant and because frequencies higher than about 300 cpm do not occur in primary aircraft structures. But the model should still be valuable for acoustic fatigue\n(most at about 200 000 cpm).\nCRACK-PROPAGATION STAGE\nBecause the crack-propagation stage is not the topic of this paper, only some\nunusual observations are mentioned.\n1. The type F + W crack detectors can detect the crack depth as well as the fatigue\ncrack surface before final failure. Figure 22 presents a fatigue failure surface and the\ncorresponding record from the detector. The record is not a linear, but an exponential,\nfunction. Its character also depends on the shape of the specimen.\n2. The crack stage is short, much shorter than often reported or assumed, when\ndifferentiated from the precrack stage.\n3. The crack stage is, on the whole, of an astonishingly constant length (fig. 23),\nwhich was computed as outlined in the appendix by P. Gschwind.\n4. Crack-stage lives decrease with decreasing probability of survival (i.e., longer\nlife), for example, by some hardening effect. (See test runs presented in fig. 23(a).) A\n498\n\nlow frequency combined with a small strain rate showed a remarkably large effect (run A,\nfig. 18). Nitrogen atmosphere (72), high overloads (90), and low frequency (64) also had\nan effect.\n5. Crack-stage lives increase with increasing precrack-stage lives, for example, by\nsome weakening effect. (See test runs in fig. 23(c).) This result was most pronounced\nfor run 100 (transverse, most simplified program).\n6. Very short crack-stage lives were experienced with program XX.\n7. The computation of the relative crack-stage life, that is, C50 100, reveals\nF50\nastonishingly high and consistent values of 10 to 30 percent.\n8. As was shown in Stockholm (ref. 19), the fatigue-cracked surface, as recorded by\nthe crack detectors, is increasing by a simple law and with a very low scatter, which can\nbe seen in figure 24.\nCUMULATIVE DAMAGE\nThe different character of the damage cumulation of the three phases of the model\nis presented in figure 25. The poor correlation of actual life until crack start with simple\nlinear cumulative damage hypothesis originates mainly from the first phase, which reveals\nthe influence of load sequence, cycle shape, and frequency. The proposed model is still\na simplification and needs many tests to find quantitative coefficients, but it is hoped that\nthe model helps for a better approach to the problem.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUp to now results from the test project permit the following conclusions:\n1. There is no important difference in time to crack start between these two alloys\n(2014 and 7075) if loaded to identical values. This result confirms earlier findings.\n2. Overloads have a favourable effect. This result is also in agreement with findings of earlier and less sophisticated tests. This should, nevertheless, not be considered\nfor calculations of time to failure.\n3. Omission of low peaks does not affect the time to failure of tests if this omission\nconcerns peaks lower than about 20 percent of the ultimate load at tension and 5 percent\nat compression.\n4. Counting load occurrences by the so-called peak between +lg mean-crossing\nmethod, peak between zero-g mean-crossing method, level-crossing and range-pair\n499\n\nmethods (both combined with pooling and blocking) is giving misleading results and must\nbe rejected.\n5. While thick ( -20 \xc2\xb5) sulfuric anodized surface layers have an unfavourable effect\non the lifetime, the contrary is true for thin (-6 p) layers or BF 4 treated elements, which\nlengthen the life.\n6. Stepwise reaming or grinding of holes can lengthen the life considerably, which\nmay be useful for maintenance people; whereas rolling of hole surfaces alone has no\neffect.\n7. There is a definite frequency effect with a minimum and a maximum.\n8. There is a strain-rate effect \xe2\x80\x94 decreasing rate giving increasing life.\n9. A model, assuming a catalytic effect of fatigue loading on the chemical activity of\nthe surface, with a persistence of this activity, is presented, which could explain the influences of frequency, strain rate, and load sequence, as well as the trend of decreasing life\nby omission of the lowest (and most numerous) peaks. The model also reveals an important reason for the scatter in the precrack stage.\n10. The crack stage, now easier to observe by a new crack detector, is (for machined\nspecimens) short \xe2\x80\x94 much shorter than often reported. It is, on the whole, of an astonishingly constant length, with a lower scatter than the precrack stage, which also diminishes\nthe scatter of the life to final fatigue failure.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMany thanks are extended to the collaborators for their help: Mr. P.

The probability with which a mission profile (or one of its parameters) occurs\ncan be used to quantitatively describe the term "typical." The airplane weight at any\npoint in the mission is, of course, a very important parameter; the present paper presents some weight data and analyses from several types of airplanes. Severallong-,\nmedium-, and short-range airplanes, flown either in passenger or in cargo service\nof Lufthansa German Airlines, were observed between January and April 1969.\nThe statistical analysis of flight times as well as airplane gross weights and\nfuel weights of jet-powered civil transport airplanes has shown that the distributions\nof their frequency of occurrence per flight can be presented approximately in general\nform. Before, however, these results may be used during the project stage of an airplane for defining a typical mission profile (the parameters of which are assumed to\noccur, for example, with a probability of 50 percent), the following points have to be\ntaken into account.\nBecause the individual airplanes were rotated during service, the scatter\nbetween the distributions of mission profile parameters for airplanes of the same\ntype , which were flown with similar payload, has proven to be very small. Significant deviations from the generalized distributions may occur if an operator uses one\nairplane preferably on one or two specific routes.\nAnother reason for larger deviations could be that the maintenance services of\nthe operators of the observed airplanes are not representative of other airlines.\nAlthough there are indications that this is unlikely, similar information should be\nobtained from other operators. Such information would improve the reliability of\nthe data of the present report.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe airworthiness standards for transport category airplanes require that the\nfatigue strength evaluation include the typical loading spectrum expected in service.\n(See ref. 1.) The loading spectrum , however, depends on the mission profile, which has\n541\n\nbeen chosen in agreement with the requirements of the customers. Since the operational\nconditions will vary from flight to flight and probably different customers may operate\nthe same type of airplane differently, several mission profiles will always be discussed\nfor an airplane that is in the project stage. (See ref. 2.) The manufacturer then has to\ncombine the various mission profiles into one or two so-called representative or typical\nones on which to base the fatigue-life evaluation.\nA quantitative description of the term "typical" may be obtained by defining the\nprobability with which a mission profile or one of its parameters will occur. This definition can be achieved possibly for parameters like flight altitude and airspeed by means\nof results from measurements which have been carried out on airplanes of similar design\nfeatures, for example, from VGH recordings. There is, however, still a lack of information insofar as parameters such as flight-time airplane weight and weight distribution are\nconcerned.\nIn order to investigate the variation of mission-profile parameters and to gather\n\ninformation which could be used for the design of similar airplanes, the following analysis has been performed.\nThe author is indebted to the German Government, Ministry of Defense, for financial support and to the departments of structural engineering and performance and operation engineering of Lufthansa for their assistance and collaboration.\nAIRPLANE TYPES, ANALYZED PARAMETERS, AND\nPERIODS OF OBSERVATION\n\nSeveral long-, medium -, and short-range airplanes flown either in passenger or in\ncargo service of Lufthansa German Airlines have been observed during a period lasting\nfrom January \'to April 1969. As far as it was possible, the following parameters have\nbeen taken for each flight from flight and fuel logs as well as from the so-called "load\nsheets:" airborne time, take-off gross weight, landing gross weight, fuel take-off weight,\nand fuel landing weight. Information about the individual airplanes and their characteristics is presented in table 1. In addition to the analysis performed for the airplanes and\nthe period of observation as mentioned, results from earlier similar investigations have\nbeen included for information.\nPRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS\n\nThe results are. presented for each of the mission-profile parameters in form of\ncumulative frequency distributions , from which the number of occurrences per flight and\nthe respective magnitude can be read, and in form of cross plots for any two parameters,\n542\n\n~ - - -- ----------------------\n\nwhich have occurred during the same flight. In order to achieve the intended generalization, the airplane and fuel weights have been related to the maximum allowable weights\nas specified in table 1.\nAirborne Time\nThe cumulative frequency distributions of airborne times for the different types of\nairplanes are presented in figure 1. The longest flight time has been observed for a\n707C airplane in cargo service; its flight time was 9.75 hours. Also a difference in flight\ntimes between cargo and passenger airplanes of the same type can be noted.\nIf the cumulative frequency distributions of airborne times are plotted on Gaussian\n\nprobability paper with a logarithmic grid for the variate , then the distributions for the\nindividual airplanes may be approximated by one or by a combination of several straight\nlines (fig. 2); that is, they correspond to logarithmic normal distributions, as it was\ndemonstrated in reference 2. Only those data have been included in figure 2, which were\nobtained during the same period of observation. The following conclusions can be drawn:\n(a) The scatter between airplanes of the same type which were flown with similar\npayload is very low.\n(b) The distributions can be separated into three groups which actually correspond\nto short-range, medium-range, and long-range airplanes.\n(c) The difference between passenger and cargo airplanes increases with the range .\n(d) All long - range airplanes show the same asymptotic behaviour, which has been\nobserved in a previous investigation. That behaviour could be caused either by the\nspecific station-to-station distances as flown in service by the operator concerned, or by\nthe limitation of fuel capacity, or - and that seems to be very likely - by a combination\nof the two reasons.\nIf it is assumed that other airlines operate Similarly and the scatter for very short\n\nflights (which occur with probabilities above 99.5 percent) is neglected, then the following\ngeneralized information may be derived for the airborne times of jet- powered civil transport airplanes. The logarithmic mean value of the airborne time amounts for short-range\nairplanes to 37 minutes and for medium - range airplanes to 60 minutes . (See fig. 3.) The\ncorresponding standard deviations , by which the slope in the probability paper is defined,\nare 0.155 and 0.215. The two logarithmic normal distributions intersect at a flight time\nof 11 minutes and are assumed to occur with a probability of 99.5 percent. At the same\npoint also, the distributions for the long- range airplanes are assumed to have their origin.\nAs has been mentioned before, the long- range airplanes show an asymptotic behaviour,\nwhich may be expressed by a mean value of 440 minutes and a standard deviation of 0 .040;\nthey do not, however , follow this distribution completely but only to a certain percentage,\n543\n\nwhich is about 25 for the passenger and 70 for the cargo airplanes. As the distribution\nfor the long-range passenger airplanes leaves the asymptote already at a probability of\n25 percent, its mean value is about 245 minutes instead of 440 minutes for the cargo\nversion.\nTwo distributions for short- and medium-range airplanes can be used directly for\nan estimation of an airborne time belonging to a typical mission profile; in the case of the\nlong-range airplanes a distinction has to be made between cargo and passenger service,\nand prior to the estimation, an assumption has to be made about the percentage of flights\nwhich will follow the asymptote, that is, which actually can be called long-range flights.\nTake-Off Weight\nA similar analysis has been made for the take-off gross weights. As it has been\nsaid before, the results are presented in relation to the corresponding maximum allowable\ntake-off weight. (See the cumulative frequency distributions .in fig. 4.) It has to be noted\nhere that for the 737 type airplanes only those take-off weights which have occurred at\nflights departing from and arriving at Frankfurt airport could be obtained. The data for\nthe other airplanes resulted from succeeding flights in the periods of observation as given\nin table 1.\nThe scatter between the cumulative frequency distributions for the individual airplanes of the same type, which flew with the same payload, was very small. (See, as an\nexample, that of passenger and cargo long-range airplanes in fig. 5.) This graph shows\nalso that the cargo airplanes are generally flown with a much higher take-off weight than\nthe passenger airplanes. An indication that this happens not only with the long-range airplanes as investigated for one operator but also with the whole fleet of aU airplanes from\nall operators may be derived from the fact that a certain type of fatigue failure in the\nwing structure has occurred at a significantly shorter service life for cargo airplanes\nthan for passenger airplanes. A careful fatigue-life evaluation has demonstrated that the\nreason why cargo airplanes have the shorter life must result from generally higher airplane gross weights. The data as presented in figure 5 confirm that prediction.\nIn order to obtain the intended generalization, the data as observed during the same\n\nperiod of time for jet-powered short-, medium-, and long-range airplanes have been\nplotted on probability paper. (See fig. 6.) The distributions for the short- and\nmedium-range airplanes can be apprOXimated by a rather small scatter band of two\nstraight lines with a standard deviation of 0.03. It says that 99.95 percent of all flights\nwere made with a take-off weight exceeding 70 to 75 percent of the maximum allowable\none, and that in about 5 percent of all flights, 100 percent of the maximum take-off weight\nwas reached. The variation of the relative take-off weight of long-range airplanes is\nlarger than that of short- and medium-range types. But also the difference between\n544\n\npassenger and cargo service is larger for the long-range airplanes, because only 0.5 percent of all flights of passenger airplanes took place with the maximum allowable take-off\nweight, whereas in the case of cargo airplanes it was almost every second fligh!.\nAs supplementary information, a cross plot of the variation of take-off weight with\nairborne time as observed on three long-range passenger airplanes is shown. (See fig. 7.)\nThis example has been selected because it was the best correlation which has been\nobtained. For the other types of airplanes, the trend was not as clear. More details\nabout this subject are given in reference 3.\nLanding Weight\nthe cumulative frequency distributions of relative airplane landing gross weight\n(fig. 8) are compared with those of the take-off weight as shown in figure 4, it is evident\nthat the curves for the landing weight of the individual types of airplanes are much more\nconsistent and conformable. When plotting these distributions on logarithmic probability\npaper and approximating them by straight lines (fig. 9), it becomes apparent that for all\ntypes of airplanes, between 2 and 15 percent of all landings occurred with the maximum\nallowable landing weight. The distributions have almost the same slope with one exception, which is again the long-range cargo-type airplane. It has to be mentioned further\nthat the scatter between the distributions for the individual airplanes of the same type was\nsimilar to that of the take-off weight and was very small. Unfortunately, for the shortrange airplanes, only the landing weights for flights from and to Frankfurt airport could\nbe obtained because of matters of organisation. This fact seems, however, to be of\nsecondary importance with regard to the result.\nIf\n\nIn order to investigate the relation between airborne time and the respective landing\nweight, cross plots have been made which showed that the landing weight is more or less\nindependent of the flight time. An example of this type of plotting is shown for three longrange passenger airplanes in figure 10.\nTake-Off Fuel Weight\nThe definition of a mission profile to be used for fatigue analysis has to include not\nonly the airplane gross weight but also the appropriate weight distribution. Since the\nweight of the fuel, which the airplane is carrying, allows information to be derived about\nthe weight distribution, an analysis similar to that for the airplane weights has been performed also for the fuel weights.\nFigure 11 shows the cumulative frequency distributions of take-off fuel weights for\nthe different types of airplanes in relation to the respective maximum fuel weights. This\nform of presentation is not very suitable for deducing a general trend, because the indiVidual curves intersect at several points. Therefore an attempt was made to plot the ratio\n545\n\nbetween take-off fuel weights and the respective allowable airplane take-off weights on\nlogarithmic probability paper. (See fig. 12.) The distributions appear as a family of\ncurves with increasing standard deviation for increasing airplane size. They are Clipped\nat the respective value of the ratio of maximum fuel to maximum allowable airplane takeoff weight. Only the distributions for the long-range cargo airplanes behave as exceptions because they consist of two parts, each of which can be described by a logarithmic\nnormal distribution. It has been demonstrated that almost every second flight of longrange cargo airplanes is made with the maximum allowable take-off weight. (See fig. 6.)\nIf the maximum allowable payload was reaChed, the fuel weight had to be restricted in\norder not to exceed the maximum allowable airplane gross weight. That may have led to\nthis combination of two logarithmic normal distributions. Furthermore, it can be seen in\nfigure 12 that the variation between the cumulative frequency distributions as observed for\nairplanes of the same type which flew with similar payload is very small.\nA generalized presentation and a good approximation to the results is obtained when\nthe scatter as occurring in the range of probabilities between 90 and 99.5 percent is\nignored and is replaced by a fictitious point at 95 percent, where all distributions are\nassumed to intersect at a weight ratio of 13 percent. (See fig. 13.)\nLanding Fu.el Weight\nIn opposition to the fuel weights as observed during take-off, it is not necessary to\n\nrelate those occurring during landing to the respective airplane gross weight, it is sufficient for obtaining general information to relate them to the maximum fuel capacity of the\nairplane type. The results of the analysis are presented again in form of cumulative frequency distributions for the different types of airplanes. (See fig. 14.) From this graph,\na further confirmation can be derived for the assumption which was made when explaining\nthe fuel take-off weights of long-range cargo airplanes because it shows that these airplanes have generally the lowest percentage of maximum fuel weight during landing.\nFrom the presentation of the distributions in a probability paper (fig. 15), the percentages\nof maximum fuel weight as occurring during every second landing can be defined as 14.5\nfor the car go and 20 for the passenger long-range airplanes. The corresponding figures\nfor medium- and short-range airplanes are 38 and 49 percent, respectively. The latter\nvalue seems to be very high; it can, however, be explained by the fact that in short-range\nservice, up to three flights were flown without refueling. It is interesting to note that the\ndistributions for the individual airplane types are almost parallel to each \'other, a tendency\nwhich already has been observed for the airplane landing weights. (See fig. 9.)\n\n546\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nThe statistical analysis of flight times as well as airplane gross weights and fuel\nweights of jet-powered civil transport airplanes has shown that the distributions of their\nfrequency of occurrence per flight can be presented approximatively in general form.\nBefore, however, these results may be used during the project stage of an airplane for\ndefining a typical mission profile (the parameters of which are assumed to occur, for\nexample, with a probability of 50 percent), the following points have to be taken into\naccount.\nBecause the individual airplanes were rotated during service, the scatter between\nthe distributions of mission profile parameters for airplanes of the same type, which were\nflown with similar payload, has proven to be very small. Significant deviations from the\ngeneralized distributions may occur if an operator uses one airplane preferably on one or\ntwo specific routes.\nAnother reason for larger deviations could be that the maintenance services of the\noperators of the observed airplanes are not representative of other airlines. Although\nthere are indications that this is unlikely, similar information should be obtained from\nother operators. Such information would improve the reliability of the data of the present\nreport.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

M. van Dijk\nNational Aerospace Laboratory NLR, The Netherlands\nSUMMARY\nIn designing against fatigue the assessment of the loading environment still is a\n\nmajor problem. Especially with military trainer and fighter aircraft which may be\nused for a variety of duties, regular or continuous load recording programs have to be\nconsidered mandatory. Such load recording programs may serve either to assess the\nconsumed fatigue life of operating aircraft or to select design spectra for future aircraft designs and a fatigue-test setup. Within this scope the National Aerospace\nLaboratory has carried out a tentative load mOnitoring program.\nA recorder system has been installed on two operational fighter aircraft. Signal\nvalues from a c.g. -acceleration transducer and a strain-gage installation at the wing\nroot were sampled and recorded in digital format on the recorder system. To analyse\nsuch load-time histories for fatigue evaluation purposes, a number of counting methods are available in which level crOSSings, peaks, or ranges are counted. Ten different existing counting principles are defined. The load-time histories are analysed to\nevaluate these counting methods.\nFor some of the described counting methods, the counting results might be\naffected by arbitrarily chosen parameters such as the magnitude of load ranges that\nwill be neglected and other secondary counting restrictions. Such influences might\ninvalidate the final counting results entirely. The evaluation shows that for the type of\nload-time histories associated with most counting methods, a sensible value of the\nparameters involved can be found at which the counting results are rather unique.\nBesides assessing the influences of secondary parameter values, the different\ncounting methods are compared with each other. The analYSis shows that the counting\nresults obta.ined by level-crossing count methods and peak count methods compare\nrather well. For most of these counting methods the differences actually turned out to\nbe surprisingly small, especially for the c.g. -acceleration load-time history. The\nresults of the range count methods exhibit larger differences. Also, with the range\ncounting methods the differences appear to be larger for the strain-gage history. The\ncomparison of the different counting methods with each other is concluded by comparing the level-crossing and peak count methods with the range count methods.\nThree different ways are used to convert level-crossing and peak countings into range\ncountings. The results show that level-crossing and peak count methods do not compare well with range count methods.\n565\n\nFinally, the described counting methods are evaluated from the fatigue point of\nview while bearing in mind the purposes they will have to serve. It is concluded that in\nassessing the life consumed by individual aircraft, a sophisticated range count method\napplied to strain-gage histories should be preferred. For the selection of design spectra\nof future aircraft or a fatigue-test setup, level-crossing and peak count methods may be\nsuitable ; in fact, they may even be preferred.\nINTRODUCTION\nA major question in designing against fatigue concerns the assessment of the\nloading environment to which the aircraft will be subjected during their service life.\nCivil and military transport aircraft generally appear to be fatigue sensitive with respect\nto gust loads. This gust loading environment is substantially independent of the aircraft\nitself. In the past, extensive measurement programs have been carried out which\nenabled the assessment of the quantitative rules determining this loading environment .\nHigh-performance aircraft appear to be relatively insensitive to gust loads with\nrespect to fatigue. With this type of aircraft, fatigue damage will be primarily due to\nmaneuver loading. However, in contrast with gust loads the maneuver loading depends\ngreatly on both the tasks to be carried out and the maneuverability of the aircraft and is\nsubstantially independent of external conditions. On the one hand, the maneuvering capabilities of the aircraft as well as the intended usage differ enormOUSly from aircraft\nto aircraft. On the other hand, the way in which the intended composite tasks are\ncarried out will be highly dependent on training philosophy, pilot experience, and such .\nTherefore , the resulting loading severity will be somewhat unknown and, in addition,\nwill exhibit important differences from aircraft to aircraft. Consequently, to assure\nadequate structural integrity (especially with fighters and military trainer aircraft) ,\nload monitoring - either individual monitoring or sample monitoring - has to be considered mandatory. Such load monitoring will provide the means to assess the life consumed by the individual aircraft and will also provide information rega rding load spectra\nto be used in future aircraft designs and fatigue testing. Within this scope the National\nAerospace Laboratory has carried out a tentative load monitoring program under contract for the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Continuous load-time histories became\navailable from both the c.g. acceleration and a wing-root- bending- moment strain-gage\ninstallation.\nTo analyse such load- time histories for fatigue evaluation purpos es, a numbe r of\ncounting methods are available in which the number of certain load occurrences is\ncounted. In the past, these counting methods were compared to each other with respect\n\n566\n\nto gust loads. Bearing in mind the nature of a gust loading environment, the results of\nthat evaluation are not self-evidently applicable to maneuver-induced load-time\nhistories.\nThe main theme of the present paper is to evaluate the basic counting methods\nwith respect to maneuver-type loading. The results will be discussed from the fatigue\npoint of view while taking into account the purposes they might serve.\nPRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYSIS\nActual load-time histories will consist of a number of load excursions with an\nirregular pattern and in irregular random sequence. The analysis of load-time histories has to be such that the amount of damage caused by these load excursions is\nsomehow quantitatively reflected in the final results. With all analysis procedures of\npresent interest, the actual time scale is irrelevant. Actually, the assumption is made\nthat for fatigue evaluation purposes load-time histories are fully characterized by all\npeak values in their actual sequence irrespective of the time elapsed between successive peaks.\nA number of different counting methods do exist in which specific occurrences\nwithin such simplified load histories are counted. The occurrences of interest are the\nfollowing:\n(1) Crossings of fixed levels with either a positive or a negative slope\n(2) Peak values (either maxima or minima)\n(3) Load variations (either load increments or decrements)\nWith counting procedures of type (1) and type (2), the counting results usually do\nnot provide any direct information about those load variations known to influence the\nfatigue process. Additional information about the load patterns that do occur will generally be needed. Thus, secondary counting prinCiples should be applied to account for\nsequence effects.\nThe different counting methods will be described in the next section. The discussion of each method will comprise these two distinct elements:\n(1) Uniqueness of the counting method\n(2) Usefulness of the counting results\nThe aspect of uniqueness will be discussed in connection with the secondary\ncounting principles. In applying these secondary counting prinCiples arbitrary parameter values may have to be adopted which may influence the final counting results.\n\n567\n\nSelf-evidently, such influence (if considerable) would reduce the validity of the\ncounting method, and the results would no longer be unique.\nThe usefulness of a counting method is influenced by its application; this relationship forms the basis for the discussion of the counting methods. The basic purposes\nare as follows:\n(1) Estimating the life consumed by individual aircraft\n(2) Estimating load spectra for future aircraft designs\n(3) Selecting the loads for fatigue testing\nThe discussion will take into account the state-of-the-art in realiSing these three\npurposes.\nDEFINITION OF COUNTING PROCEDURES\nTen different counting procedures are considered in the present evaluation,\nenumeration of which can be found in table I. It should be noted that although all methods\nare derived from the literature (refs. 1 to 7), slightly different names have been adopted\nfor some of the methods to emphasize the characteristic differences between them.\nSimple Level-Crossing Count Method\nThe simple level-crossing count method is the simplest way of analysing load\nhistories. A number of preset levels are chosen . . Each time the load crosses one of\nthese levels with positive (or negative) slope, a count is made. Obviously, it does not\nmatter whether level crossings are counted with positive or negative slope. Both procedures will provide almost exactly the same results (maximum difference will be\n1 count at each level for each load history analysed). With this method only momentary\nload values are of interest. Information regarding the actual load patterns is fully lost.\nIn order to interpret the counting results for fatigue evaluation purposes, additional\ninformation will be needed regarding the expected load patterns. The insufficiency of\nthis counting method is clearly demonstrated by figure 1. Although the load patterns\nshown on the left-hand and right-hand sides of this figure are highly different, the same\ncounting results will be obtained. Small intermediate load variations, which virtually\nare of minor tmportance in the fatigue process, will give rise to additional countings.\nGenerally, interpretation of the counting results will be such that the number of\ncrOSSings of a level is assumed to equal the number of maxima above (or minima below)\nthat level. Figure 1 also clearly demonstrates the incorrectness of this assumption.\nObviously, small intermediate load variations seriously hamper the validity of this\ncounting method. In practical applications a secondary restriction may be applied to\n\n568\n\ncompensate to some extent for this setback. It may be decided to neglect level\ncrossings which are associated with load variations smaller than a certain range value.\nThis decision would actually mean skipping all load variations which do not exceed that\nassumed range value. This range filtering may be carried out by means of a logical\nsystem or may be due to the type of load transducer used, as for example with scratch\ngages (ref. 8).\nRestricted Level-Crossing Count Method\nThe restricted level-crossing count method applies the same primary counting\nprinciples as the simple level-crossing count method. Different secondary counting\nprinciples are applied, however. A crossing of a level with positive (or negative) slope\nis not made until the load also has crossed a second lower (or higher) preset level in\nopposite direction. This counting method is associated with the so-called "Fatiguemeter"\ndeveloped at the British Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and is normally referred to\nin the literature as the Fatiguemeter count method. Although the Fatiguemeter was\ndeveloped to count acceleration occurrences, the method may also be used to monitor\nother parameters such as strains. The adjustment of the secondary counting levels\ngenerally is of arbitrary nature. The drop or rise required to satisfy the secondary\ncounting condition may be the same for all counting levels or may be chosen in a progressive way. With the progressive adjustment, the higher (or lower) the primary\ncounting level concerned, the larger is the drop (or rise) required to satisfy the secondary counting condition. Still, however, interpretation is hampered by intermediate load\ncycles as is clearly demonstrated by figure 2. Rather different load patterns are\ndepicted on the left-hand and right-hand sides of this figure but, as in the simple levelcrossing count method, they will produce equal counting results.\nSimple Peak Count Method\nWith the simple peak count method all peak values are counted. The counting\nresults are presented separately for the maxima and the minima. From the definition\nit is understood that with this counting method, as well as with all other peak count\nmethods, the load patterns that actually occur are taken into account to some extent\nsince application of this method implies a peak detection. However, the counting results\nwill not provide any information regarding the sequence of the maxima and the minima\nthemselves. It is not possible to tell whether a counted peak was actually associated\nwith small or large load variations. Again interpretation is seriously hampered by the\nsmaller intermediate load variations. Much the same as with the simple level-crossing\ncount method, a secondary counting condition may be introduced to more or less compensate for this setback by disregarding peaks which are not associated with at least a\n\n569\n\ncertain load range. It sometimes is decided to count only maxima above a specified\nmean level and minima below that level. This Simplification does not improve the\nvalidity of the counting results at all. For example, minima associated with minor load\nranges are sometimes neglected whereas the adjacent maxima would still be counted.\nLevel - Restricted Peak Count Method\nThe principles of the level-restricted peak count method are very much the same\nas those of the restricted level- crossing count method (Fatiguemeter counting). In contrast, however, with the restricted level- crossing count method, only a count is made\npertaining to the highest primary counting level that has been crossed before the secondary counting condition was met, after which all othe.r previous crossings of primary\ncounting levels are disregarded. Actually, the crOSSings of primary and secondary\ncounting levels are considered merely to detect a peak associated with at least a certain\nload range. Figure 3 shows a comparison of this method (see fig. 3(b)) with the\nrestricted level-crossing count method (see fig. 3 (a)) . The final counting results do not\nprovide definite information regarding the actual sequence of the maxima and the minima.\nThe method has been widely used in association with VGH recording programs (ref . .3) .\nRange-Restricted Peak Count Method\nWith the range-restricted peak count method, the intention is to count merely the\nmore significant peaks. The method will merely count peaks that are associated with\nmajor load variations. The counting is restricted to peaks beyond mean threshold levels\n(e.g., minima below O-g and maxima above 2- g) . The peaks to be counted are those which\nare both preceded and followed by drops (or rises) of at least a certain magnitude (e.g .,\nI-g increment) or exceeding a fixed percentage of the incremental peak value (e.g.,\n50 percent), whichever is the greater. Here the incremental peak value is defined as\nthe difference between the peak value itself and the mean load level. The counting conditions for a maximum count are illustrated in figure 4. From the definition it is understood that intermediate load fluctuations are disregarded rather rigorously by this\nmethod. The method also neglects some load fluctuations which are not truly insignificant. However, counts pertaining to the higher maxima and the lower minima have\nbecome more relevant. The method has been used extensively with VGH recording\nprograms (ref. 6).\nPeak- Between-Mean- Crossings Count Method\nThe peak-between-mean- crossings count method is also intended to count only the\nmore Significant peaks. Only the highest maximum or the lowest minimum between two\nsuccessive crOSSings of a specified mean level is counted. With this method intermediate\n570\n\nload fluctuations are disregarded most rigorously. However, all counts are now known\nto be associated with major deviations from the steady-flight level. A further refinement of the counting procedure may be obtained by applying two mean threshold levels\nas references. The highest maximum will be counted between any two successive\ncrossings of the upper threshold level, as well as the lowest minimum between any two\nsuccessive crossings of the lower threshold level. The method is illustrated in figure 5.\nWith this refinement, peaks associated with minor deviations from the steady-flight\npattern will also be neglected. On the other hand, less high maxima and lower minima\nwill be disregarded in applying this counting procedure. The method has been used\nextensively in evaluating VGH records (ref. 9).\nSimple Range Count Method\nWith the simple range count method as well as with all other range count methods,\nthe load fluctuations are of direct interest. The fluctuations are known to be a primary\ninfluence in the fatigue process. A range is defined as the difference between two successive peak values. With the simple range count method all ranges are counted. It\nshould be noted here that counting ranges essentially implies a peak detection procedure.\nWith this simple range count method the loading sequence is taken into account to some\nextent; that is, with each count two succeeding characteristic values of the load history\nare considered. However, information regarding the peak values themselves is completely lost.\nIn practical applications it may be decided to neglect small load fluctuations which\n\nare not of much importance for the fatigue process. As is illustrated in figure 6, disregarding such small load fluctuations does affect the final counting results seriously.\nApparently, the final counting results will depend on the magnitude of the smallest load\nrange that will be counted.\nIt may also be decided to count only ranges pertaining to load increments or load\ndecrements. One should bear in mind, however, that the counting results for the positive\nranges might differ appreciably from the counting results for the negative ranges.\nConsequently, such a Simplification might yield less relevant reSults.\n\nRange-Mean Count Method\nThe prinCiples of the range-mean count method are very much the same as with\nthe simple range count method. However, this counting method does provide additional\ninformation. Not merely the load ranges are counted. With each count the corresponding\nmean value of the load range counted will also be taken into account. So each count is\nnow associated with two values which completely describe the load variation concerned.\n\n571\n\nAs is clear from the definition, the counting results will again be sensitive to the\nsmallest load range regarded.\nRange- Pair Exceedance Count Method\nThe range-pair exceedance count method is intended to analyse load histories in\nterms of load cycles rather than load ranges (half cycles). Since fatigue properties are\ngenerally presented in terms of load cycles, this is of course a favourable property.\nTo accomplish a count two conditions must be met. Each count of a range-pair\nexceedance of a certain specified magnitude, say R, will have to be associated with a\nload increment (positive range) of at least R succeeded by a load decrement (negative\nrange) of at least R. By proceeding as such and consecutively conSidering a number of\ndifferent range values, the counting result will finally give the number of range pairs\n(load cycles) exceeding a certain range value R. The counting procedure is illustrated\nin figure 7. The Vickers- Armstrongs strain range counter (ref. 10) is an example of a\ncounting device operating according to this counting method. In conSidering figure 7, it\nbecomes clear that the method will primarily count the major load fluctuations. Small\nintermediate load fluctuations will be regarded as superpositions on the major load\npatterns. Obviously, this counting method does take into account the loading sequence.\nFatigue test experience indicates that this characteristic feature is desirable. The\ncounting procedure also has the advantage of being insensitive to the magnitude of the\nsmallest load range regarded.\nAnother interesting feature of this counting method will become clear by considering the largest range-pair value that will be present in the final counting results.\nBy nature, the range-pair exceedance count method will combine the largest load incre ment and load decrement that both occur in the load history concerned and will count\nthem as one load cycle of that specifiC magnitude. Likewise, the counting procedure will\nalso combine the next largest load increment with the next largest load decrement, and\nso on. From fatigue experience it is known that extreme negative load excursions do\nactually influence the damage caused by a succeeding extreme positive load excursion.\nSo it may be stated that fatigue experience is indeed reflected in the counting prinCiples.\nNevertheless, this feature does imply a complication. It certainly is not relevant to\ncombine a very low minimum with a very high maximum which occur at instances very\nmuch apart. In practical applications the method should be carried out separately on\nsegments of the load history to avoid irrelevant countings. Treating each flight as such,\na separate load-history segment seems to be a both obvious and rather practical\napproach.\nAnother example of a counting device operating according to this counting proce dure is the Schenck range-pair counter (ref. 5). With this counting device, however, the\n\n572\n\nstarting procedure is not altogether in accordance with the basic counting principles.\nIn .starting the counting process the device will analyse the load history as if the\nstarting point of the load history were an extreme minimum. This actually means that\nfor the first count to be made, merely the second condition of the basic counting principles will have to be met. The effect is illustrated in figure 8 and demonstrates that\nthe Schenck procedure will produce higher counting results than the basic procedure. In\napplying the counting procedure on a flight-by-flight basis, the effect on the final counting\nresults might be significant.\nAlthough the range-pair exceedance count method does apply rather sophisticated\ncounting principles, the method is still hindered by two shortcomings:\n(1) No information will be provided regarding the mean values of the load cycles\ncounted.\n(2) Not all load excursions will be fully counted (see fig. 9).\n\nBoth shortcomings are offset by the next counting method.\nRange- Pair- Range Count Method\nThe range-pair-range count method is also intended to count load cycles. The\ncounting procedure operates in two phases. In the first phase all intermediate load\ncycles are detected and counted in connection with the associated mean values. Each\nintermediate load cycle will be eliminated from the load history after being counted.\nThe procedure is continued until the load history does not present any more intermediate\nload cycles. As may be easily verified, the residual load history will necessarily have a\ndivergent- convergent envelope such as depicted in figure 9. In the second phase of the\ncounting procedure, this residual load history is analysed according to the range-mean\ncount method, These counting prinCiples are illustrated in figure 10. The range-pairrange counting procedure is referred to in the literature as the NLR counting method\n(ref. 2) and the rain-flow counting method (ref. 4).\nThis range-pair-range counting method generally has the same advantages as the\nrange-pair exceedance count method without being hindered by its previously mentioned\nshortcomings. It should be noted that this counting method also is intended to analyse\nload histories on a flight-by-flight basis.\nNUMERICAL EVALUATION DATA\nUnder contract for the Royal Netherlands Air Force a tentative load monitoring\nprogram has been carried out. This load monitoring program was intended to serve the\nfollowing primary purposes:\n573\n\n(1) To demonstrate the feasibility of a digital load recording system\n(2) To demonstrate the feasibility of a strain gage as a load transducer in operational conditions for long-term load monitoring\n(3) To emphasize the desirability of recording strain histories instead of acceleration histories\n(4) To evaluate different counting methods\nTwo operational fighter aircraft have been equipped with both an accelerometer\ntransducer at the aircraft c.g. and a bending-moment strain-gage installation in the\nwing root section. Signal values from both transducers were sampled at a scanning rate\nof 24/sec. After being digitised, the data were stored on a magnetic recorder medium\nwith a 15-hour recording capacity. The beginning of each flight could be recognized by\na series of marking numbers which were automatically entered on the recorder medium\nat the activation of the aircraft electrical power. Every 15 flight hours the recorder\nmedium was removed for further proceSSing on ground-based facilities. By means of a\ndigital computer the data were checked for spurious readings after which a data compression was carried out.\nThe data compression reduced the enormous amount of data to a relatively small\nnumber of characteristic data resembling the peak values that did occur. The compressed load-time history still comprises all Significant information for fatigue evaluation purposes. During the data compression phase more than just peak values are\ndetected. Peaks which are not associated with at least a certain relatively small variation are disregarded to reduce the number of data and to remove data that are of less\nimportance for the purposes concerned. The minimum load range thus left in the compressed load-time history amounted to approximately 7 percent of the aircraft limit load\nlevel. When applying the counting procedures just described, such a range filtering is\neither obligatory or does not significantly . affect the counting results since other more\nstringent restrictions are applied. Consequently, the load histories resulting from the\nfinal data compression phase are still suited to evaluate the different statistical load\ncounting procedures. A plot of such a compressed load-time history for a typical fighter\nmission is shown in figure 11. Such load histories - covering some 75 flight hours were used to evaluate the different counting methods. The results of this numerical\nevaluation are presented in the next section.\n\n574\n\n---. --- -------- -----------------------------------\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\nGeneral Comments\nThe counting procedures which have been described herein were simulated by\nmeans of a digital computer to analyse the available load-time histories. The results\nobtained with the c.g.-acceleration history and the wing-root-bending-moment straingage history are presented separately. It should be noted that this paper is not intended\nto present a quantitative comparison of the counting results obtained for the acceleration\nhistory with those obtained for the strain-gage history.\nThe load data are presented in arbitrary units as a result of the digitisation\nprocess. In general, the counting results were calculated with an interval width of\n8 units. The results have been plotted without any fairing.\nApplication of some counting methods did imply the definition of a mean level.\nFor the c.g.-acceleration data the 1-g steady-flight level has been defined as such,\nalthough in terms of mathematical statistics this level is not actually the mean value\nbut rather the most probable value. An "equivalent" 1-g level has been assessed to be\nused as mean reference level in the strain-gage data analysiS. Actually, the equivalent\n1-g strain-gage value is not a constant value. Nevertheless, the definition remains\nrelevant since, on the one hand, merely a reference level has to be chosen while, on the\nother hand, with high-performance aircraft the \'variations in this 1-g strain-gage value\nare relatively small in comparison with the load fluctuations of general interest.\nBefore discussing the numerical results, it should be mentioned that the counting\nresults obtained with different counting procedures are not all fully independent of each\nother. The following relations do exist which will all be easily understood by considering\nthe definitions given for the various methods:\n(1) Simple level-crossing counting results may be derived from the counting\nresults obtained with the simple peak count method.\n(2) Simple peak counting results may be derived from both the counting results\nobtained with the range-mean count method and those obtained with the range-pair-range\ncount method.\n(3) Simple range counting results may be derived from the range-mean counting\nresults.\n(4) The results obtained with the simple peak count method and the peak-betweenmean-crossings count method will be the upper and lower limits of the counting results\nobtained with all other level-crossing and peak count methods described.\n\n575\n\n(5) Peak-between-mean-crossings counting results may be derived from the\n\nrange-pair-range counting results.\nResults From Level-Crossing and Peak Count Methods\nThe results obtained with the level-crossing and peak count methods are presented in figures 12 to 15 and table IT.\nAs previously stated, parameter values associated with secondary counting principles may influence the final counting results. The effect is illustrated in figure 12,\nfigure 13, figure 14, and table II for the counting results obtained with the simple levelcrossing count method, simple peak count method, peak-between-mean-crossings count\nmethod, and restricted level- crossing count method, respectively.\nIn figures 12 and 13 it is shown that the value of the smallest load range regarded\n\ndoes indeed affect the counting results obtained with the simple level-crossing and\nsimple peak count method. The effect of doubling the basic range-filter value (Ro)\nfrom 13 to 26 units does not seriously affect the counting results for the higher load\nvalues. Apparently the countings which were additionally disregarded were mainly\nassociated with load cycles near the steady-flight level. Further increasing the rangefilter value hardly changed the counting results for the higher load values. However,\napplying a smaller range-filter value yielded hIghly different counting results. The\nmain conclusion to be drawn is that if a sensible range-filter value is adopted, the\ncounting results for the higher load values are rather unique. It is nevertheless interesting to note that the counting results obtained by analysing the strain-gage history\nappear to be more sensitive to the adopted range-filter value than the results obtained by\nanalysing the acceleration history. In conSidering both load histories in more detail, the\nmajor load excursions from the strain-gage history presented small intermediate load\nfluctuations more frequently than did the major load excursions from the acceleration\nhistory. This effect is most probably due to dynamic effects (dynamic overshoot and\nbuffeting) .\nBy definition it is clear that the restricted level-crossing count method, the levelrestricted peak count method, and the range-restricted peak count method are intended\nto apply secondary counting principles which at least override the applied basic range\nfiltering. From the preceding results the effect of the applied secondary parameter\nvalues may be expected to be rather limited. This limited effect is indeed confirmed by\nthe data from table IT, in which the restricted level-crossing counting results are tabulated by applying two different adjustments of the secondary counting levels. The\ncounting results came out to be only slightly different. Similar results were obtained\nwith the level-restricted and range-restricted count methods. Also with the peakbetween-mean-crossings count method (fig. 14), the influence of the secondary parameter\n576\n\nvalues (e.g., mean threshold levels) was rather limited. From these findings it may be\nconcluded that the majority of the load fluctuations of interest were separate excursions\nfrom the steady-flight level.\nAll the level-crossing and peak count methods described are compared in figure 15.\nAs might be expected from the aforementioned findings, the differences are not large,\nalthough they are more pronounced with the strain-gage data than with the acceleration\ndata. Nevertheless, when accurate data are required, the results obtained with different\ncounting methods are not fully compatible (number of counts may differ by a factor of 2).\nResults From Range Count Methods\nThe results obtained with the range count methods are depicted in figures 16 to 18.\nIt should be noted that these results have been plotted without distinguishing between\npositive and negative ranges. This effect has been studied in connection with the simple\nrange count method. Comparative results showed that when applying the basic rangefilter value of 13 units, the number of positive and negative ranges counted did not differ\nvery much. However, when applying a smaller range-filter value, the differences\nappeared to be much more pronounced. The counting results pertaining to the negative\nranges appeared to be far more sensitive to the applied range-filter value than the\n:!ounting results pertaining to the positive ranges. Apparently, small intermediate load\nfluctuations more frequently occurred after the load had reached a maximum. The overall effect of the applied range-filter value on the results obtained with the simple range\ncount method is illustrated in figure 16. Doubling the basic range-filter value from 13 to\n26 units does appreciably affect the counting results, especially the results obtained by\nanalysing the strain-gage history. When applying a smaller range-filter value than the\nbasic one, the differences were even more pronounced. It should be noted that further\nincreasing the applied range-filter value (>26 units) still yielded appreciably different\ncounting results. Consequently, it is stated that the results obtained by the simple range\ncount method are not unique even when intermediate load fluctuations are disregarded.\nThe counting results from the various range count methods are compared in figure 17. The curves presented illustrate that the range-pair-range count method and\nboth variants of the range-pair exceedance count method do not produce very different\nresults. The simple range counting results, however, appear to be very different. It is\ninteresting to note that with the strain-gage data, both variants of the ra,nge-pair exceedance count method coincide completely because of the presence of the Ground-Air-Ground\n(G-A-G) cycle (with every flight the strain-gage history will exhibit a relatively low\nstarting value).\nIn comparing the mean countings as obtained by the range-mean count method and\nrange-pair-range count method, the results have been averaged - that is, all mean\n577\n\n- -- --\n\n------------\n\ncountings pertaining to a specified range interval have been averaged while a corresponding standard-deviation value has been calculated. The averaged means thus\nderived are represented in figure 18. With the c.g.-acceleration data as well as with\nthe strain-gage data, the range-pair- range count method yielded lower averaged mean\nvalues than did the range-mean count method. However, the differences are much more\npronounced with the strain-gage data. This fact may be easily understood by considering\nthe counting principles of the range-pair-range count method and bearing in mind that m\nevery flight the strain-gage history will both start and end with a low minimum due to\nthe G-A-G cycle. These results clearly demonstrate that with the range-pair-range\ncount method the G-A-G cycle is certainly accounted for .\nThe calculated standard-deviation values corresponding to the averaged means are\nnot plotted in figure 18. It is interesting to note, however, that these standard-deviation\nvalues were approximately equal for all range intervals considered and, besides,\nappeared to be relatively small (order of magnitude of 10 units). From this finding it\nmay be concluded that most load fluctuations of equal magnitude apparently occurred\nbetween approximately the same levels.\nComparison of Range Count Methods With Peak Count Methods\nBy nature the results obtained by the range count methods are not directly comparable with the countings resulting from the level-crossing and peak count methods\nsince different types of occurrences are counted. To enable a comparison the counting\nresults have to be converted. The present comparison will be accomplished by applying\ndifferent ways of converting simple peak countings into range countings. Reference will\nbe made especially to the range-pair-range counting results since this method is\nbelieved to represent best the amount of fatigue damage caused by the load history concerned. The following three conversion procedures are considered (see fig. 19):\n(A) Maxima and minima are supposed to occur in random sequence.\n(B) Maxima and minima are supposed to occur in random sequence; however,\n\nmaxima below a certain level (e.g., 115 units) and minima above a certain level (e.g.,\n95 units) are neglected. Although the additional assumption seems a curious one, the\ncase is relevant since actually the data disregarded generally are not available.\n(C) Maxima are to be combined with minima having the same probability of\nexceedance (equal cumulative frequency).\n\nThe results of these converted simple peak countings as well as the range - pairrange countings and simple range countings are plotted in figure 19. As is illustrated,\nthe applied conversion procedures do produce highly different results. Again the straingage data reveal the largest differences. However, none of the applied conversion\n\n578\n\nprocedures produce counting results which approximately coincide with the range-pairrange countings . From these findings, it is concluded that a quantitative comparison of\nrange countings with simple peak countings as well as with all other types of peak and\nlevel-crossing countings is hardly feasible for the type of load histories concerned.\nDISCUSSION\nBasically the counting methods as described herein are intended to interpret\nirregular load-time histories by counting the number of specific types of load occur rences. In the preceding sections the uniqueness of the information has already been\ndiscussed and illustrated. In discussing the usefulness of the counting results, one\nshould primarily take into account the purposes these results are meant to serve - that\nis, the type of information required.\nIn assessing the life consumed by individual aircraft, reference has to be made to\nexperimental fatigue data, either simple S-N data or full - scaie fatigue test data.\nAccomplishing such life calculations, however, will be useful only if the final counting\nresults are sufficiently accurate. Thus, in assessing the life consumed by individual\naircraft, a counting method should be used which fully takes into account the actual loadtime history and which does not need the application of additional assumptions to be\ninterpreted. Besides, the fatigue damage caused by the actual load-time history should\nbe reflected in the counting results (interaction effects). By conSidering its definition\nand bearing in mind the aforementioned requirements, it is felt that the range-pair-range\ncount method is best suited for asseSSing the individual aircraft fatigue damage. Also,\nthe range-pair exceedance count method may be rather useful; however, with this method\nthe counting results are not definite since no information is provided about the means of\nthe range pairs counted. Consequently, less accurate results are to be expected. It\nshould be noted that the same remarks hold when the counting methods are meant to\ncompare with any degree of accuracy the life consumed by individual aircraft of the same\ntype. Here, however, the requirements perhaps could be less stringent since it may be\nknown that the aircraft are operating according to the same type of load patterns. In\nthis case, restricted level- crossing or restricted peak count methods may be suited as\nwell.\nIn estimating load spectra for future aircraft designs or selecting the loads for\nfatigue testing of an aircraft type that possibly has not even been in service operation,\nthe requirements are somewhat different. Here, great accuracy would be more apparent\nthan real. The load patterns as well as the sequence in which they occur may be entirely\ndifferent with different types of aircraft. In particular, the number of intermediate load\nfluctuations at the higher load levels may be expected to be strongly related to the\n\n579\n\naerodynamic performance capabilities, which may be highly different for different aircraft types. Estimating loading spectra as well as selecting loads for fatigue testing\nusually implies a mission analysis procedure. The number of exercises (during a\nmission) that will be carried out has to be estimated. The assumption made is that each\nseparate exercise is associated with major load excursions from the steady-flight level\n("characteristic events"). Small intermediate load fluctuations are considered of less\nor even irrelevant importance. A counting method should be chosen which will provide\nthe number of such major load excursions and the peak levels they are associated with.\nAs will be understood, the peak-between-mean-crossings count method is very well in\naccordance with these requirements. However, a restricted level-crossing or peak\ncount method may be suited as well. To obtain a loading program for fatigue testing,\nthe number of "events" counted may be arranged in a realistic sequence. Interaction\neffects will then be accounted for to some extent.\nIt can be concluded that the range-pair-range count method apparently has the best\n\ngeneral validity. On the one hand, the method embodies some of the characteristics of\nthe other counting methods mentioned (simple level-crOSSing countings, Simple peak\ncountings, and peak-between-mean-crossings countings may all be derived from the\nresults of this range-pair-range count method). On the other hand, the load histories\nare taken into account by this method as much as possible from the fatigue point of view.\nConsequently, general application is recommended.\nCONCLUSIONS\n(1) Some counting methods require secondary counting restrictions involving the\nchoice of an arbitrary parameter value which may influence the final counting results.\nWith the exception of the simple range count method and the range-mean count method, a\nsensible parameter value can be found which will yield rather unique counting results for\nmaneuver-type load histories.\n(2) The restricted level-crossing and restricted peak count methods will yield\napproximately equal counting results, especially at the higher load levels. The simple\nlevel-crOSSing and Simple peak count methods, however, will yield conservative counting\nresults.\n(3) Level-crOSSing and peak countings virtually do not compare very well with\nrange countings.\n(4) The range-pair-range count method and the range-pair exceedance count\nmethod will produce approximately equal range counting results.\n\n580\n\n(5) Both the simple range count method and the range-mean count method will provide irrelevant information since the counting results are very sensitive to the magnitude of the smallest load ranges regarded.\n(6) Both the range-pair exceedance count method and the range-pair-range count\nmethod provide relevant information in assessing the life consumed by individual aircraft. However, the range-pair-range count method is to be preferred since this method\nprovides additional information about mean values of the ranges.\n(7) In comparing individual lives .of aircraft that are of the same type and that\noperate according to the same kind of duties, a restricted level-crossing or restricted\npeak count method may be sufficiently relevant.\n(8) In estimating spectra for future aircraft designs or in selecting load events for\nfatigue testing, the peak-between-mean-crossings peak count method will provide\nrelevant data.\n(9) The range-pair-range count method will have the best general validity. The\nresults obtained by this method are unique as well as definite and do suit. all purposes.\n\n581\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

At the same time it is implicit that\nno unnecessary work should be done and that the time out of service should be minimal.\nIt is perhaps necessary first to outline the approach to the maintenance and\n\ninspection of the components and systems of the aircraft. It has become apparent that\nmost components, and therefore systems , suffer primarily from random effects . In a\nrelatively few cases a life can also be dictated by a wear-out rate , but random defects\npredominate and have to be dealt with by inspections and functional checks so that the\ndefect is detected at the earliest opportunity.\nBy duplication, or triplication , the integrity of the aircraft can be maintained , and\nthe study of reliability levels can set the periods for inspection or checks which limit\nthe period of dormant failure. Since a large number of components are functioned on\neach flight, the number of additional checks required to reveal a dormant fault is\nreduced.\nIt can be seen that for systems and components , the optimum periods for inspec-\n\ntion, maintenance , and overhaul can be safely developed in respect of a particular aircraft type and a particular operation by a process of recording and analysing data on\nfailures and strip reports and by general experience gained in service. The aircraft\nitself determines its own maintenance schedule.\nIn respect of structures , a different approach has to be adopted. With the advent\nof fail-safe structures , the duplication of load path which provides failure survivability\nhas been achieved. Unfortunately , no ready indication of failure is available. The\npurpose of inspection is therefore to detect failures before they become catastrophic ,\n599\n\nand to detect such deterioration with time and use which, in itself , will lead to failure.\nThe object of maintenance is to restore the structure to its original condition and to maintain the failure survivability originally built into it.\nIt is natural that there should be a desire to use the same downtime of the aircraft\n\nto deal both with structure and systems. Improved component life and improved reliability lead to longer intervals between major maintenance inputs. There is therefore an\ninevitable clash of requirements because the structure tends to deteriorate with age and\ndemands increased vigilance.\nThe structure inspection that emerges is therefore a compromise influenced by\nopportunity, and it changes with time. In deciding initially on the nature and extent of\ninspection, the design philosophy and the background of fatigue and fail-safe substantiation tests are of paramount importance. A structure inspection schedule for the lead\nfleet of a new type of aircraft is arrived at by extracting the structure content from the\ntotal schedule. A typical structure schedule is outlined as follows (in this schedule flighthours and flights are approximately the same):\nAt each departure and at each 72 hours elapsed time: A general walk-around\ncheck which would detect gross damage , due to either serious structural failure or\ndamage inflicted on the ground.\nAt each 300 hours or flights: A general visual inspection of the complete\nexterior, supplemented by opportunity inspection of such areas where access is\nrequired for maintenance and servicing. This check is also used to monitor any\nitem on special surveillance.\nAt 2000 hours (12 to 15 months): A more detailed visual inspection of the\nlower fuselage, externally and internally , including pressure bulkheads, and doorsurround structure. This is aimed primarily at detecting corrosion. Ultrasonic\nchecks are also made at this interval on bonded stringers in the lower fuselage ,\nand radiographic inspection is made in those areas of the lower fuselage not accessible for visual inspection.\nAt 5000 to 6000 hours or flights (2 to 2t years): The major maintenance\ncheck in which all access panels are removed and all structure inspected visually.\nThis represents the most detailed routine visual inspection of the structure possible\nby normal access, that is, without stripping out interior trim and lagging. At the\nsame intervals - but not necessarily at the same time - radiographic inspections\nare made of closed structures such as\nHorizontal stabilizer\nFin\nPrimary control surfaces\nSlats, flaps , air brakes , and so forth\n600\n\nAll these inspections are carried out on all aircraft in the fleet. The extensive\nareas of the internal structure of the upper fuselage (above floor level) are the subject\nof a sampling procedure. This approach is made because of the extensive downtime\ninvolved if all trim, soundproofing, thermal lagging, air ducts, and so forth are removed.\nExperience has shown that the area below floor level is that most prone to corrosion.\nThis can occur early in the aircraft life and can progress relatively rapidly. Experience\nalso suggests that the upper areas dry out more rapidly, and corrosion is only likely at\na later stage and will develop less rapidly.\nThe sampling programme is therefore started in about the 5th year of operation\n(10 000 to 12 000 hours). Because of the large work load and downtime involved, radiographic inspection is used extensively but is supported by visual inspection as follows:\n.In each of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th years of operation, one composite aircraft is examined,\n25 percent by visual means and 75 percent by radiographic means. The samples involve\nnot less than 60 percent of the fleet, and at the end of this period one complete composite\nfuselage will have been examined visually; and three, radiographically. It is planned that\nafter the 9th year the sampling will be extended so that by the 20th year all aircraft in the\nfleet will have been examined completely both visually and radiographically.\nThe choice of inspection method is basically economic. Where visual inspection is\nviable, it is preferred. Radiography is an adequate tool to detect the Significant craCking\nof internal structure such as frames, stringers, and cleats. It can also indicate corrosion and paint flaking - but requires considerable skill in interpretation. A 10-percent\nreduction in material thickness can be reliably detected , provided the corrosion deposits\nare not retained. The critical corrosion along the heel line of a stringer or lap joint is\ndetected mainly by evidence on the adj oining surface.\nIn a particular case where this inspection schedule has been applied up to an aver-\n\nage aircraft life of 12 000 flights or 6 years, 38 defects have been identified. Of these ,\n16 involved fatigu~ cracks, in secondary structure, and two involved corrosion in primary\nstructure. Most of these defects were detected on the major check. In the period concerned , the major check period has been progressively increased from 3000 to 5000 hours,\nor flights, on the basis that those items which have shown up and are not subject to modification action are retained as specific items on the annual or 300-hour inspection.\nFor detection of deterioration that could be the cause of fatigue, this increase in\nthe major check period is feasible. If, however, the major check is to form the basis\nfor detection of fatigue cracks concerned with the fail-safe design concept, then the period\nbetween inspections must have some finite limit. This should be the interval assumed in\nthe design concept from first detectable crack to the point at which crack propagation\nreduces the static strength to proof load. Ideally, this should be demonstrated by a fullscale test for all fatigue-critical regions of the structure. For the aircraft concerned\n601\n\nthe period is not less than 5000 flights, with proof load applied each 2500 flights. On\nthis basis each aircraft structure must be examined in detail at maximum intervals of\n5000 flights. It might well be argued, however, that when the aircraft life is relatively\nlow , so that this interval represents a Significant part of the probable scatter between\nidentical failures on aircraft of the same fleet, then staggered inspection over a longer\nperiod is perhaps justified on the basis that no cracked aircraft will fly more than 5000\nflights before the defect is detected in another of them. It is implicit that all aircraft\nwill be checked within a short period from the discovery of the first defect.\nAs the aircraft life increases, so that the safe period of crack propagation becomes\nsmall in relation to the probable scatter in failure , the inspection would have to be\nincreased to cover each aircraft in 5000 flights. As the aircraft life increases still further so that the probability of failure is high and simultaneous failures become probable,\nit would be prudent to reduce the inspection interval.\nFinally, it would seem logical that whilst the ratio of test life to aircraft life is 5\nor more, inspection can be done on a sampling basis only, to assess the general deterioration, such as corrosion. Thus, an ideal structure inspection schedule would result and\nwould be based on aircraft life and test life. (See fig. 1.) The practical problem would\nthen be to integrate this schedule with the remainder of the maintenance requirements\nand the seasonal demands on aircraft.\nIf there are several operators involved in making up a Significant fleet of "lead"\n\naircraft, there is a case for spreading the initial sampling across all the aircraft to thus\nreduce the requirement on the individual operator. This involves a reporting system so\nthat the manufacturer can coordinate results. There are possibly limitations to this\napproach, since each operator tends to operate on a different route structure and in a\ndifferent environment.\nMost aircraft types operated by British European Airways (B.E .A.) have carried\nsome form of in-flight recording equipment, either fleetwise or on selected aircraft. In\nsome cases this has been a condition in the terms of the warranty on the fatigue life of\nthe primary structure. The recording equipment has fallen into two categories:\n(1) Continuous recording of acceleration thresholds or strain-range thresholds\non entire fleets\n(2) Continuous recording of acceleration thresholds together with other flight data\non a limited number of aircraft\n\nIn the first category , counting accelerometers mounted at the center of gravity record\nthreshold counts at increments of 0.2g between 0 and 2g. Total counts in each level are\nread and recorded at each 300-hour check.\n\n602\n\nFatigue-meter data are fed back to the respective manufacturers at intervals,\ntogether with operational data from which a typical flight plan, representative of the\nroute network, can be deduced. This is done by taking significant samples of summer\nand winter operations and includes take-off weight, fuel state at take-off , cruise altitude,\nand flight duration . Fuel burn-off is computed and thus actual weight and fuel state at\neach phase of flight are deduced. The aircraft manufacturer then computes fatigue damage rate and compares this with the damage rate used in the fatigue test or calculated\nfatigue life.\nSimilar procedures are adopted in the case of strain-range counters, except that\nthese give \'a more direct indication of damage rate and require less operational data.\n\nIn both cases the manufacturers concerned have stated that an increase in service\nlife of up to 30 percent has been possible compared with the service life that would otherwise be imposed. So far, this has all been in respect of those parts of the structure\nwhich are on a "safe life" basis.\nBoth these types of recording instrument are such that they are quite practical for\nan airline to carryon all aircraft. They need little attention and are reasonably reliable.\nAs long as there are safe-life items in the primary structure, the improvement in life\nthat has been possible would appear to be adequate return .\nThe more comprehensive type of observer unit is more questionable. Attempts\nhave been made on two types of aircraft to get a simultaneous record of acceleration\ncounts, speed, height, time of flight, and so forth by use of film recorders, switched on\nat take-off and off on landing by an airspeed switch. " They have been installed in perhaps\ntwo aircraft of a new fleet with the object of obtaining more complete data for an initial\nperiod. The problems with film recorders have been\n(1) Short duration of film leading to either much lost recording time, or very\nfrequent film changes\n(2) Unserviceability revealed only after film development\n(3) Reference still required to flight documents to obtain aircraft weight and\nother data\n(4) Low order of reliability\nThe authors have found from experience that only about 10 percent of the total hours\nflown by the aircraft equipped with the film recorders were satisfactorily recorded. It\ndoes not seem practical to use this type of equipment in the environment of day-to-day\nairline operation.\nIt has been B.E .A. policy to record manually maximum cabin differential pressures\n\nfor each flight on all aircraft. The pilot records this in an appropriate box in the techni603\n\ncal log. This information is extracted and the total flights in each band of pressure, in\nincrements of 1/2 psi, are computed. Where there are maximum lives prescribed for\nmodification or replacement of structure, this information is forwarded to the manufacturers and to the airworthiness authorities at six monthly intervals. All unrecorded\nflights are assumed to be at maximum differential pressure, and a factor of 10 percent\nis added to the recorded pressures to allow for inaccuracies of recording. At the same\ntime, the equivalent flights at maximum differential pressure are computed and forwarded\nto the inspection department to allow mandatory life requirements to be monitored.\nThis policy has yielded Significant benefits where safe-life situations have existed.\nIt allows advantage to be taken of all flights where only low pressures are needed, yet\nretains the advantage of operational flexibility, such as cruise altitude on longer flight\nsections and occasional high rates of descent. This flexibility is otherwise lost if pressure is permanently reduced. On one type of aircraft it has allowed an extension from\n12 500 to 30 000 flights before a major modification, with its accompanying weight penalty,\nwas required and from 17 000 to 50 000 flights before wholesale replacement of fuselage\nskins.\nIt is true to say that the advantages so far gained by continuous recording in airline\n\noperation have all been associated with safe-life structure situations. It is questionable\nwhether real advantages can accrue in the case of a truly fail-safe structure. One of the\nadvantages, to the manufacturer, of a fail-safe philosophy is that the duration of the fullscale test can be reduced. If the structure is designed for a long fatigue life, it is probable that natural failures will not be produced on test. Provided adequate fail-safe tests\nare carried out, this may be satisfactory from an airworthiness point of view, but it would\nseem pointless, in this case, to try and correlate test and actual aircraft usage in order\nto try and predict the operator\'s long-term planning requirements.\nOnly if full-scale testing is extended until fatigue failures occur - and perhaps only\nif these then indicate the need to impose a finite life when action must be taken - can\nbetter data on actual aircraft usage yield some dividends.\nMAINTENANCE ASPECTS\nIt will be appreciated that although the modern public transport aircraft is a highly\n\ncomplex and sophisticated engineering product, it is also the means by which the airlines earn their revenue. The aircraft utilisation rate, which varies during the year and\nreaches its peak during the summer months, is laid upon a foundation of known work programmes which stipulate that various aircraft will be undergoing maintenance for block\nperiods of time during the year. It will be seen, therefore, that in order to support the\ncommercial plans, an extremely well-devised maintenance programme is required. For\n\n604\n\nan airline to operate at optimum efficiency , the maintenance programmes are planned to\nensure that the work requirement is matched by the necessary spares, materials , tools ,\nequipment , and labour at the commencement of the hangar check.\nThe unexpected and nonscheduled problem is, therefore, strictly an economic embarrassment. The discovery of a fatigue crack, corrosion, or any of the other mechanical\nfaults which beset airline operators from time to time and which must be repaired on an\nurgent basis are the ones which really cause the headaches.\nIdeally, the airline engineering base should be a facility carrying out planned maintenance and changing or repairing wornout components. This is, of course , an ideal situation which never exists in practice. For instance , a piece of ground-support equipment\ncould be run into the side of an aeroplane and thus cause a delay to the service. Similarly , the work necessary to repair the unexpected crack in a major piece of structure\ncan soon seriously upset the best planned engineering commitment and rapidly lead to\nnonavailability of aircraft.\nIt must also be remembered that there will be an internal conflict of interests within\n\nthe airline. The production and maintenance departments are charged with producing\naeroplanes for service to meet the commercial demands, and an engineering requirement which may extend the hangar check times or takes aircraft out of service is reSisted,\nunless vital to continued safe operation. Also, since modern aircraft construction is\nmaking ever-increasing use of integrally machined components , which in themselves are\nmuch more difficult to repair in terms of time and complexity than the riveted skinstringer combination, it also follows that the flow of spare parts from the manufacturer\nin the event of a rash of fatigue problems across the fleet could be inadequate to meet\nthe demand.\nAll aircraft exhibit cracks in various structural components. Many of these , having relieved a local stress condition , will then remain static in length for a considerable\nperiod of time, and the aircraft will continue in service with these known defects. Normally such defects are examined for signs of propagation at each scheduled inspection\nuntil the part can be replaced or repaired, ideally at a convenient hangar check. This\napplies mainly to multi-load-path and secondary structure, but of course all cracks and\ndefects are evaluated and a course of action decided upon which is dependent upon the\nsignificance of the defect. In the case of more serious defects the normal procedure is\nto raise a special check on the remainder of the fleet to determine the extent of the problem fleetwise. The speed at which the fleet examination takes place, of course, depends\nupon the severity of the initial defect. In this way the extent of the problem is assessed\nand the final action will take the form of a modification or repair, which can be raised\neither by the air line or manufacturer, or by replacement on a lifed basis. In many cases\nthe defect is subsequently monitored by the addition of a specific item to the approved\n605\n\nmaintenance schedule for inspection at appropriate intervals, or included in the reportable\nstructural inspection programme.\nIn the case of a repair, the structure is usually returned to the "as new" condition,\n\nbut when this is impractical or economically not justified, the fatigue life of the repair\nmust at least match the residual life of the aircraft. In many cases when extensive testing or investigation of a fatigue problem is required, it may be necessary to incorporate\na temporary repair which satisfies limit loads and thus keeps the aircraft flying. The\nlong-term action which may require a slightly more extensive repair can then be carried\nout at a later stage, usually at a major overhaul. It has been found from experience that\nthe manufacturer\'s solution to most light-alloy fatigue failures invariably results in a\nsteel replacement.\nOnce a defect is found, a repeat inspection of the area is established, which can be\nextremely frequent in serious cases. The general accessibility and nature of the defect\nwill determine the method of inspection, that is, visual or nondestructive testing techniques. In any event the general aim is to implement modification-campaign action to\neliminate the defect and its associated inspection.\nWhen a new defect is found , the airline informs the manufacturer, who then advises\nall operators of similar equipment to inspect for that particular defect. The manufacturer\'s notification usually ranges from a newsletter covering general advice, the service\nbulletin which forms the usual channel of communication, to the service cable for serious\nproblems which require rapid investigation.\nSince fatigue failures are generally related to total flying hours or landings , it follows that an airline operating "young" aircraft is less likely to be hit by the nonscheduled\nproblem than an operator with older aircraft of the same type, and has a better chance of\ncarrying out the rectification on a planned basis.\nA large number of fatigue problems encountered can be traced to detail design\nfaults, and occasionally the classic "don\'ts," such as sharp section changes and stress\nraisers, still seem to be perpetuated.\nIt has been found from experience that unnecessary disturbance of an area during\n\nmaintenance can in fact be detrimental in the long run . For example, abrasion of surfaces can break down sealants , particularly in integral fuel tanks, and minute scratches\nare then susceptible to corrosion or crack initiation.\nThe Corporation is an approved design organisation and designs and incorporates a\ngreat deal of repair work, particularly to components. For example, the Corporation has\na great deal of experience on the repair of honeycomb structures. Any repair work must\nmaintain the aircraft to airworthiness requirements. This, of course, includes correct\nheat-treatment techniques , particularly with the high-strength steels , and maintenance\n606\n\nof adequate strength reserves after such rework. A copy of the repairs is automatically\nsent to the manufacturer for his information , but naturally in the event of serious problems the manufacturer is consulted prior to making the repair.\nAlthough the primary airframe structure, critical joints, representative panels,\nand the like are subj ected to extensive fatigue testing at the design and construction stage\nto prove the integrity of the basic airframe, secondary structure does not receive the\nsame consideration. Experience shows that defects in secondary structure tend to be\nrepetitive and are both costly and time consuming to repair or replace. For example,\ncertain areas of most aircraft floors require frequent replacement because of corrosion\nunder and adjacent to galley and toilet areas and for damage due to cargo loading and\nrepeated walking traffic . It would seem that the original floor is largely designed by\nstatic load requirements on the grounds that a stronger and longer lasting floor, because\nof the weight penalty incurred, is not justifiable on economic grounds. This, of course,\nis all good theory , but replacement floor costs are extremely high. Because of the\nabsence of reliable fatigue data on floor materials, various sandwich floor-panel materials were investigated on a cost- effective basis which involved static testing and fatigue\ntesting a large number of samples. In fact, representative panels of various materials\nhave been installed for service evaluation. The airline is, of course, ideally suited to\nperform actual in-service tests, and new ideas are often subjected to field tests in a\ntrue operational environment. Although in the manufacturer\'s initial fatigue test every\nattempt is made to represent a true operational condition, it sometimes happens that\ndespite the best efforts of the designer, a part will fail prematurely because of the influence of a secondary unknown or neglected loading system. A case in point recently\noccurred when a fairly substantial shear angle hidden from immediate view was found\nto have cracks of considerable length along the bend radius. On investigation the fracture face showed that the angle, which had been designed to carry shear loads, was in\nfact also being subjected to secondary bending loads which tended to open and close the\nangle. Fortunately, in this case, the cracks were found before a failure occurred.\nAnother example in which the initial design failed to take complete account of the\nfull loading cycle is the fatigue cracks experienced in top wing skins of some aluminium\nalloys containing a high percentage of zinc. The alloy is chosen in the first instance\nbecause of its mechanical properties and because the normal flight loads give a compressive loading. It has been established, however, that the ground loads, which reverse\nthe wing bending system, cause tensile loads of sufficient magnitude to cause fatigue\ncracks around stress concentrations, fastener holes , for example , in this material.\nOne interesting case of structural failure occurred when the designer had assumed\na certain airspeed for flaps extended for his fatigue analysis within the flaps-out speed\nrange. The pilots , however , were in fact flying the aircraft right up to the flap limit\nspeed, and premature failures occurred. Another problem which occurred was that in\n607\n\n- - - - -- - - -\n\n~\n\n-\n\n-\n\nthe original design certain assumptions were made with respect to ground turns based\nupon airports known at that time. Subsequently the Commercial Department decided that\na great deal of revenue was forthcoming from lesser known airports, and ground manoeuvres in excess of the assumptions were made. Airports are very congested places on the\nground as well as in the air, and ground turns can be dictated by available ground space.\nAn aspect of airline usage which is outside the normal operating pattern is crew\ntraining. It is quite normal for one aeroplane to spend a considerable time on a training\ndetail, and this operation sometimes results in flying techniques which are not up to normal standards. The number of landings are very considerable over a short period of\ntime and since one of the objects of the exercise is to acquaint flying crews with aircrafthandling characteristics which are seldom met in practice, the airframe is subjected to\na great number of loads which are not normally met in passenger service. These facts\nmust be recognized at the design stage. Airframe damage has, in fact, resulted from\ntraining details.\nCivil aircraft are in service for a considerable period of time, some 15 years or\nmore typically. Airframe lives on the order of 60 000 flying hours are commonplace\nwith the current generation of aircraft, and of course the fatigue problem intensifies as\nthe aircraft get older. The economics of airline operation is such that operators are\ncarrying out life-extension programmes in order to achieve these lives by replacing\nand/or reworking critical areas at some stage during the service life of the aircraft. It\nis vital, therefore, that the initial assumptions, analysis, and testing faithfully represent\nas far as possible the complete loading programme and its environment, and that the\neffect of new materials is fully examined, particularly where no previous experience is\navailable.\nEach new generation of aircraft brings a new challenge both to the operator and\nmanufacturer, and the SST will be no exception. The operator must rely on the manufacturer to provide a trouble-free product, and to this end, practical airline experience\nof day-to-day operational problems and practices is freely available. Operational experience should be fed back into new deSigns to ensure long, trouble-free lives, particularly\nat the detail design stage.\nThe addition of speed and temperature will bring new complications to the SST. It\nis to be hoped that the racehorse will not exhibit the temperament of a thoroughbred but\nwill retain the cart-horse stamina for everyday reliability.\n\n608\n\nSUGGESTED BASIS OF MAJOR STRUCTURE INSPECTION\nTEST LIFE\nA/C LIFE\n\n1\xc2\xb75\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n+\n\n....\n\n+1\n\nL&J\nL&J\n\n+\n\n...J\n\nLa..\n\n....\n\nLa..\n\n!\nI\n\n+\n\nI\n\n-<\n\na:\n(.)\na:\n\n-<\n-\n\n+\n\n~\n\n--...

Holshouser and Ruth D. Mayner\nNational Transportation Safety Board\nWashington, D.C., U.S.A.\nSUMMARY\nA review of records maintained by the National Transportation Safety Board\nshowed that 16 054 civil aviation accidents occurred in the United States during the\nI\n3-year period ending December 31, 1969. Material failure was an important factor in\nthe cause of 942 of these accidents. Fatigue was identified as the mode of the material\n~ailures associated with the cause of 155 accidents and in many other accidents the\nr~cords indicated that fatigue failures might have been involved.\nThere were 27 fatal\n,\naccidents and 157 fatalities in accidents in which fatigue failures of metal components\nwere definitely identified.\nFatigue failures associated with accidents occurred most frequently in landinggear components, followed in order by powerplant, propeller, and structural components in fixed-wing aircraft and tail-rotor and main-rotor components in rotorcraft.\nIn a study of 230 laboratory reports on failed components associated with the\n\ncause of accidents, fatigue was identified as the mode of failure in more than 60 percent of the failed components. The most frequently identified cause of fatigue, as well\nas most other types of material failures, was improper maintenance (including inadequate inspection). Fabrication defects, design defiCiencies, defective material , and\nabnormal service damage also caused many fatigue failures.\nI\n\nFour case histories of major accidents are included in the paper as illustrations\nof some of the factors involved in fatigue failures of aircraft components.\nINTRODUCTION\nCivil aviation accidents in the United States were investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board from 1940 until 1967, when the National Transportation Safety Board was\nestablished as an independent agency within the Department of Transportation. On\nApril 1, 1967, the safety functions of the Civil Aeronautics Board, including the responsibility for investigating and determining the cause of civil aviation accidents , were\ntransferred to the new Safety Board. Hence , the information on accidents used in the\npreparation of this paper was taken from records and files accumulated partly by the\n\n611\n\nCivil Aeronautics Board (CAB) but now maintained by the National Transportation Safety\nBoard (NTSB).\nAn aircraft accident is defined in NTSB Regulations as "an occurrence associated\nwith the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any persons board\nthe aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked, in which any person suffers death or serious injury as a result of being in or\nupon the aircraft or by direct contact with the aircraft or anything attached thereto, or\nthe aircraft receives substantial damage." The Board regulations also contain definitions of terms , such as "serious injury" and "substantial damage ," that form a part of\nthe definition of an accident. During the last 10 years (1960-1970) the number of civil\naircraft accidents per year meeting this definition has ranged from 4709 in 1961 to 6185\nin 1967. More than 98 percent of these accidents were in general aviation, which, of\ncourse, means that, in general, they involved relatively small aircraft engaged in private\nflying, business trips, and small commercial operations.\nInformation on the extent to which fatigue failures in metal components are involved\nin the cause of accidents was obtained by reviewing accident records and la1;:>oratory\nreports that are available in Safety Board files. The accident records provided considerable data on material failures but did not provide statistically reliable information\nregarding either the mechanism or cause of failure. Hence, the data presented under the\nheading of "Accident Records" is included primarily as background information for the\nresults of the study of laboratory reports. Four case histories of maj or accidents are\npresented as illustrations of some of the factors that are involved in fatigue failures of\naircraft components.\nACCIDENT RECORDS\nThere were 16 054 civil aviation accidents in the United States during the 3-year\nperiod between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1969. NTSB records show that material failure caused, or was a factor in the cause of, 942 of these accidents. Thus, material failure was involved in the cause of slightly less than 6 percent of the total number of\naccidents during this period. Only 20 of the 942 material failure accidents occurred in\nair carrier operations.\nFatigue was identified as the mode of material failure in 155 accidents. There\nwere many other accidents in which fatigue failures might have been involved but the\nfractures were not identified as fatigue in the record. For example, there were a number of in-flight failures of propeller blades and many cases of connecting rods, connecting\nrod caps, or connecting rod cap bolts failing in reciprocating engines in which the mode\nof failure was not identified. It seemed likely that in many cas es the investigator may\n\n612\n\nhave been unable to recognize evidence of fatigue or that such evidence might have been\ndestroyed by subsequent damage to the fracture surfaces.\nInformation obtained from the accident records is summarized in tables 1 and 2.\nThe serious nature of fatigue failure accidents is shown by the fact that the 16.4 percent\nof the material failure accidents in which fatigue failures were identified accounted for\n31 percent of the aircraft that were completely destroyed , 46 percent of the fatal accidents , and 63 percent of the fatalities.\nThere may be some inaccuracies in the classification of components in table 2\nbecause the specific part that failed was not always adequately identified in the record.\nFor example, a few parts listed as landing-gear components might actually be parts of\nthe hydraulic system or some parts listed under powerplants might be more properly\nidentified as electrical system components. However, the general trend of component\nfailures shown in the table indicates that landing gears and powerplants are major problem areas.\nThe records from which the data in tables 1 and 2 were obtained did not provide any\nSignificant amount of information regarding the basic cause of failure except in one category. Definite evidence of improper maintenance or inadequate inspection was found in\n130 accidents , whereas there were indications that many other accidents might have been\nprevented by better inspection and maintenance procedures.\nThe number of accidents listed in the tables, of course , represent only a small percentage of the total number of material failures in civil aircraft. Most of such failures\ndo not result in accidents and the failed components are replaced or repaired on a more\nor less routine basis.\nLABORATORY REPORTS\nAdditional information regarding the mechanisms and causes of aircraft material\nfailures was obtained from a study of 230 laboratory reports on the examination of failed\ncomponents . These were reports on work done in the Safety Board\' s laboratory , work\ndone for the CAB and the Safety Board at the National Bureau of Standards , and a few\nreports from industry laboratories. All the reports were on components from aircraft\nthat had been involved in accidents between 1962 and 1970. Reports on failed components\nthat were not pertinent to the cause of an accident were eliminated from the study insofar\nas possible.\nA summary of the results of the study is given in table 3. In classifying the causes\nof failure , fabrication defects were listed as such only when they appeared to have been\ncaused by a manufacturing operation. When this kind of deficiency occurred during maintenance, the cause of the resulting failure was classified as "improper maintenance."\n613\n\nThe "abnormal service damage" category includes only failures caused by service damage that probably would not have been detected by normal inspection procedures. The\ncause of failure was listed as improper maintenance if it appeared that the service\ndamage could have been found and repaired prior to failure by ordinary good maintenance\npractice. As anyone who has been involved in the investigation of service failures will\nrealize, the evidence regarding the cause of failure was not always conclusive. In many\nof the cases studied, some element of judgment entered into the classification. Stress\ncorrosion and hydrogen embrittlement failures were grouped together in the table because,\nin some cases, reports of studies of the fracture surfaces with an electron microscope\nidentified the fractures as "stress corrosion or hydrogen embrittlement" but did not\nattempt to distinguish between the two failure mechanisms.\nFatigue failures accounted for more than 60 percent of the failed components on\nwhich laboratory reports were available in NTSB accident files. The distribution of\nfatigue failures among the causes listed in table 3 illustrates one of the major difficul ties of preventing such failures in aircraft. So many different kinds of material defects,\ndesign errors, mechanical damage, and corrosive attack can contribute to the cause of\nfatigue failures that it is extremely difficult to guard against all of the possibilities. As\nin the review of accident records, the results of the study of laboratory reports indicated\nthat improper maintenance is the most frequent cause of fatigue and other types of material failures that contribute to the cause of aircraft accidents.\nSpecific causes of failure included in each category in table 3 are as follows. (No\nattempt was made to list these causes in order of frequency of occurrence. The exact\nnumber of failures due to each specific cause could not be determined because in many\ncases the failure could be placed in one of the broad categories but the cause could not\nbe more specifically defined, mainly because of discrepancies in maintenance records,\ninconclusive results of laboratory work, and more than one factor being involved in\nthe cause of failure.)\nImproper maintenance:\nInadequate inspection\nFailure to replace damaged parts\nFailure to comply with manufacturer\'s service bulletins or FAA Airworthiness\nDirectives\nInadequate lubrication\nFailure to service air drying system\nUnsatisfactory welding\nInadequate shot peening\nFailure to repair damaged protective coating\nInadequate or excessive torque applied to fasteners\nFailure to install fasteners\n\n614\n\nUse of unsatisfactory replacement parts\nInadequate cleanup after repairs\nForeign material left in gear housing\nImproper alteration of components\nSurface damage due to misuse of tools\nInadequate control of plating operations\nGrinding cracks\nApplication of excessive force to press fits not adequately prepared for assembly\nImproper adjustment of gear engagement\nInsufficient thread engagement\nDamage from misuse of inspection equipment\nDeSign deficiencies:\nInaccurate stress analysis (mainly due to insufficient consideration of sources of\nstress concentration)\nInadequate specification of dimensional tolerances\nFailure to allow for fabrication and assembly variables\nSelection of unsuitable material or incompatible combinations of material\nInsufficient consideration of the effect of possible bending loads on parts designed\nto resist tension or compression loads\nInsufficient consideration of the direction of grain flow in forgings and extrUSions\nInsufficient consideration of maintenance problems\nFailure to specify adequate decarburization limits\nFabrication defects:\nMachining errors\nUnsatisfactory welding or brazing\nUnsatisfactory plating\nImproper drilling of rivet holes\nSurface damage by defective tools\nDamage by careless use of tools\nFailure to remove cleaning solution from a closed cavity\nInadequate cleaning after an internal machining operation\nInadequate control of bonding operation\nDefective material:\nSurface decarburization\nHeat treating cracks\nOmitting heat treatment or surface hardening operation\nForging flaws\nDefective extrusion bonding\nOverheating during heat treatment\n\n615\n\nCasting porosity or cracks\nExcessive nonmetallic inclusions\nGas contamination\nFailure to use specified material\nAbnormal service damage:\nEngine overspeed\nExcessive vibration\nFailure of pilot to follow operating instructions\nInadequate securing of cargo\nUnauthorized towing procedures\nExcessive maneuvering loads\nDeformation from undetermined source\nBird strike\nExcessive loads resulting from damage to an associated component\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the studies summarized in this paper emphasize the importance of\nfatigue and maintenance problems in the operation of aircraft equipment. By far the most\ncommon type of material failure encountered in aircraft accident investigation is in\nlanding-gear and powerplant components of small fixed-wing aircraft. Material failures\nmost frequently cause accidents when they occur while the aircraft is airborne or during\nlanding, although serious accidents may result from failures during any phase of operation.\nOpportunities to reduce the number of accidents caused by fatigue failures and other\ntypes of material problems exist in almost all phases of aircraft construction, maintenance , and operation. The greatest potential for reduction in the number of accidents is\nin improving the maintenance of general aviation aircraft. However, numerous accidents\nin both general aviation and air carrier operations could be prevented by improvements\nin design; better quality control during material proceSSing, fabrication, and assembly;\nimproved inspection and maintenance programs; and more careful handling of aircraft,\nparticularly on the ground during taxiing and towing operations.\nAlthough the air carriers have had relatively few accidents caused by material failure, in the 3-year period included in the review of accident records, 6 of the 20 air carrier accidents in which material failure contributed to the cause resulted in 138 fatal\ninjuries. Accidents involving fatigue failure accounted for 103 of these air-carrier fatalities. In several failures of landing-gear components and jet engine compressor and turbine diSks, major disasters were avoided only by fortunate circumstances. Thus , this study\nindicates that air carrier, as well as general aviation, aircraft have serious material\nfailure problems.\n616\n\nCASE HISTORIES\nFour case histories of accidents due to fatigue failures of components are presented.\nI. Los Angeles Airways, Sikorsky S-61L Helicopter; Compton, California;\n\nAugust 14, 1968\nThis helicopter crashed when a fatigue failure of one of the main rotor blade spindles caused the blade to separate from the rotor hub. The drawing of the failed spindle\nin figure 1 shows the location of the fracture. A fatigue crack had propagated from a\nsingle origin (fig. 2) in the journal-bearing fillet through approximately 70 percent of\nthe cross section of the spindle shank prior to complete failure. The spindle was made\nof quenched and tempered 4340 steel, with a specified hardness of 34 to 38 Rockwell C\nand a specified minimum ultimate tensile strength of 150 000 pounds per square inch.\nThis spindle had been reworked in 1966, 2 years before the accident, according to a procedure recommended by the manufacturer. The rework included regrinding, shot peening, and nickel plating the journal bearing surface and fillet where the fatigue crack originated. In June 1968, approximately 2 months before the accident, during a regular periodic inspection, the spindle was inspected for cracks by a fluorescent magnetic particle\nmethod . No cracks were detected.\nA laboratory study after the accident revealed the following factors that were probably involved in the cause of the spindle failure:\n1. The fatigue crack was a high cycle, low stress, slowly propagating crack that\nprobably had been present when the spindle was inspected for cracks 2 months before\nthe accident.\n\n2. The fatigue nucleus was in the steel, under the nickel plating, in an area where\nvery small, shallow pits were found in the surface of the fillet.\n3. In the area where the fatigue crack originated the steel had a banded microstructure. The overall hardness in this area was 28 Rockwell C, below the specified minimum\nof 34 Rockwell C, and the fatigue nucleus was in one of the softer bands where the local\nhardness was well below 28 Rockwell C.\n4. Residual tensile stress in the fillet surface as a result of nickel plating might\nhave contributed to the initiation of the fatigue crack although the plating process specified by the manufacturer was selected to minimize residual stresses.\n5. The fillet where the fatigue crack originated had not been properly shot peened.\nThis fact is considered to be an important contributing factor as adequate shot peening\nwould probably have eliminated the effect of the shallow pits and would have reduced the\neffect of the banded microstructure and low hardness.\n\n617\n\nII. Lake Central Airlines , Allison Prop-Jet Convair 340; Marseilles , Ohio;\nMarch 5, 1967\nA fatigue failure of a propeller torque cylinder (fig. 3) precipitated the crash of\nthis two- engine , turboprop aircraft. The fatigue failure , however, was caused by a prior\nfailure in another component of the propeller pitch control system. The initial failure\nwas excessive wear in the splines of the torque piston.\nPropeller blade pitch in this aircraft is controlled through torque units (one unit\nfor each of the four propeller blades) operated by hydraulic oil pressure. Through a\nsystem of splines , linear movement of the torque piston in the torque cylinder produces\nchanges in propeller pitch. An increase in hydraulic pressure moves the piston outward\nto increase blade angle and a decrease in pressure permits the normal aerodynamic loads\non the propeller to decrease blade angle. The piston has both internal and external\nsplines and after the accident both sets of splines in one piston were found to be severely\nworn. These splines had not been nitrided as required by the manufacturer\'s specification for the piston. The excessive wear in the splines allowed the piston to float free in\nthe cylinder without engaging the splines of the mating parts. This condition did not\nimmediately cause any detectable change in the operation of the propeller because of the\nredundancy built into the pitch control system . However, each time the oil pressure in\nthe system was increased the free piston was forced hard against the cylinder cap. This\nforce resulted in stresses exceeding the fatigue strength of the cylinder wall and eventually caused a complete fatigue failure of the cylinder.\nExamination of the fracture (fig. 4) showed that small fatigue cracks had propagated\nfrom the inner surface of the cylinder wall and combined to form a continuous crack\ncompletely around the inner circumference of the cylinder. This fatigue crack did not\npenetrate completely through the wall so that hydraulic pressure was maintained until\nthe cylinder failed completely. When the cylinder failed , loss of hydraulic pressure\noccun\'ed so suddenly that the propeller pitch lock failed and resulted in a severe propeller overspeed. All four propeller blades were thrown off the propeller hub; and one\nof them went through the fuselage and caused the airplane to break up in the air and crash.\nThe series of events that led to this accident started with the omission of the nitriding of the torque piston splines. As a result of investigations associated with the accident , changes were made in the quality control system of the propeller manufacturer and\nseveral design modifications were made in the propeller pitch control system. These\nchanges appear to be adequate to prevent a similar set of circumstances causing another\naccident.\n\n618\n\nlIT. Wein Consolidated Airlines, Fairchild F-27B; Pedro Bay, Alaska;\n\nDecember 2, 1968\nThis aircraft encountered severe to extreme .clear-air turbulence and crashed during a flight from Anchorage to Iliamna in Alaska. Investigation of the accident showed\nthat an in-flight structural failure of the right wing had occurred through an area where\nfatigue cracks had weakened the structure on both sides of an access door in the bottom\nsurface of the wing.\nThe piece of wreckage in which the fatigue fractures were found is shown in figure 5. Fatigue cracks had originated at four fastener holes, two on each side of the\naccess door, that were alined in a chordwise direction. These initial cracks had propagated and joined to form a crack about 31 inches long on the aft side of the access opening and about 2~ inches long on the forwaid side. No evidence of fatigue cracking was\nfound in the access door cover. Adjacent to the fastener holes, the fracture surfaces\nwere flat and smooth, as shown in figure 6, but as the cracks progressed away from the\nholes, they showed an increasing tendency to propagate as slant fractures. Numerous\ncrack jump marks (small regions of ductile rupture) were found in both the flat and slant\nfracture areas. An example of the appearance of these jump marks is shown in figure 7.\nFatigue and fail-safe tests of an F-27 wing made several years before the accident\ngave some indication that a load equal to about 77 percent of limit load might have been\nrequired to break the wing with cracks about 3 inches long on both sides of the No.1\naccess door. However, the numerous indications of high stress intensity found on the\nfatigue fracture surfaces suggested the possibility that high gust loads might have caused\na rapid tearing extension of the cracks shortly before the wing failed completely. Such\na rapid crack extension would not have left any visible evidence on the fracture surface.\nIf it included rupture of the access door cover, it would have connected the two fatigue\ncracks; thus the crack length was increased to more than 17 inches and the load required\nfor final failure was reduced.\nA Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness Directive requires u.S.\noperators to make periodic inspections for cracks at many locations in the F-27 wings.\nFor several years before the accident, X-ray inspections at 1200-hour service time intervals had been made in the area of the No.1 access door in both wings of the plane that\ncrashed. There was nothing in the aircraft maintenance records to indicate that cracks\nhad been detected. Reexamination of the inspection radiographs after the accident, however, revealed evidence that cracks had been present in the vicinity of the access doors\nin both wings for more than a year before the accident. Crack indications were found in\nthree sets of radiographs made during this period. If the cracks had been detected and\n\n619\n\nreported, the operator would have been required by the Airworthiness Directive to make\nan approved modification of the wing structure which would have increased the strength\nof the access door area where the wing failed.\nAs soon as the crack indications were found in the radiographs, the FAA was notified and a special inspection was recommended by the Safety Board. The FAA issued a\ntelegraphic Airworthiness Directive requiring an immediate inspection for cracks in the\nwings of all F-27 aircraft with 5000 hours or more time in service. Sixty-seven aircraft\nwere inspected in compliance with the Airworthiness Directive and 13 cracks were found\nin eight aircraft.\nIV. TAG Airlines DeHavilland Dove; Lake Erie near Cleveland, Ohio;\nJanuary 28, 1970\nA TAG Airlines DeHavilland Dove crashed through the ice into Lake Erie in January\n1970, after a fatigue failure of a wing attachment fitting. The appearance of the failed\nfitting is shown in figure 8 and the surfaces of the fatigue fracture in figure 9. Fatigue\ncracks had originated at the edge of the hole for the main wing-to-fuselage attachment\nbolt and had propagated through approximately 75 percent of the cross-sectional area at\nthat point before the fitting failed completely.\nThe fitting was made of steel that had been heat treated to an ultimate tensile\nstrength of approximately 175 000 pounds per square inch, and the bore of the hole where\nthe failure occurred had been chromium plated. No chromium plating had been used in\nthe original design, but some fittings with chromium plating in the attachment bolt hole\nwere installed prior to 1961. The National Transportation Safety Board report on this\naccident stated:\n"The manufacturer had long been aware of the problem caused by the chromium plating process and had reduced the \'safe life\' of this fitting to 10 000 flying hours in July 1961 (Technical News Sheet 178). At this time, it was recommended that an inspection for the chromium plating of the root-joint attach fitting\nbe carried out at the next convenient opportunity and, in any case, prior to the\naccumulation of 10 000 flying hours. It was recommended that any fitting found\nto have the chromium plating be changed at the next removal of the wing or before\n10 000 hours, whichever came first. This recommendation had the approval and\nconcurrence of the United Kingdom\'s Air Registration Board. These requirements\nbecame mandatory for aircraft registered in the United Kingdom but not for those\nregistered in the United States.\n"Based upon this recommendation by the manufacturer, the Federal Aviation\nAdministration issued Airworthiness Directive 61-18-3, effective September 1, 1961.\nThis directive repeated the opening preamble of the Technical News Sheet 178 but\nadopted only the requirement to inspect the fitting for chromium plating and to\n620\n\n~~---\n\n---\n\nreplace it, if so plated, prior to the accumulation of 10 000 flying hours. The\nrecommendation to replace any chromium plated fittings at the next wing removal\nwas not made a part of the requirement by the FAA on the U.S. registered aircraft."\nIn November 1965 the wings of the aircraft had been removed for certain required\n\nmodifications. At that time, the fitting that eventually failed had been in service for\n4998 hours. It was inspected for cracks, but was not replaced, and failed after 9383 hours\nof service time. A factor in the failure of the fitting before it reached the 10 OOO-hour\nmandatory removal time was the severe operating conditions at TAG Airlines. TAG\nflights were considerably shorter and were flown at higher speeds and lower altitudes\nthan the standard flight profile for Dove aircraft.\n\n621\n\nTABLE 1.- U.S. CIVIL AVIATION ACCIDENTS INVOLVING MATERIAL FAILURE\nAS A CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR\n\n@anuary 1, 1967 to December 31, 196~\nAir\ncarrier\nAll material failure accidents:\nNumber of accidents . . .\nNumber of fatal accidents\nNumber of fatalities . . .\nMaterial failure accidents involving\nfatigue failure:\nNumber of accidents . . .\nNumber of fatal accidents\nNumber of fatalities . . . .\n\n622\n\nGeneral\naviation\n\nTotal\n\n20\n\n922\n53\n110\n\n942\n\n6\n\n138\n\n12\n4\n103\n\n59\n\n248\n\n143\n23\n\n155\n\n54\n\n157\n\n27\n\nTABLE 2.- U.S. CIVIL AVIATION ACCIDENTS INVOLVING MATERIAL FAILURE\nAS A CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR\n@anuary 1, 1967 to December 31 , 196~ .\nNumber of\naccidents\nType of aircraft:\nSmall fixed wing\nLarge fixed wing\nTurboprop . .\nReciprocating engine\nTurbojet and turbofan\nHelicopters . . .\nPhase of operation:\nIn-flight.\nLanding . . . . . .\nTake-off . . . . .\nTaxiing or towing\nParked . . . . . .\nExtent of damage to aircraft:\nSubstantial . .\nDestroyed\nMinor or none\nType of component that failed:\nLanding gear . . . .\nPowerplant . . . . .\nPropeller assembly\nFlight controls\nstructural\nFue I system .\nHydraulic system\nElectrical system\nTail rotor assembly\nMain rotor assembly .\nInstruments . . . . .\nAuxiliary components\n\nNumber of accidents in\nwhich fatigue failures\nwere identified\n\n814\n\n107\n\n16\n\n7\n\n11\n\n5\n\n5\n\n2\n\n96\n\n34\n\n416\n352\n145\n28\n\n76\n\n45\n28\n6\n\n1\n\n818\n122\n2\n\n117\n38\n\n371\n\n58\n\n333\n76\n\n23\n35\n\n25\n\n5\n\n24\n24\n17\n\n10\n\n14\n25\n23\n\n1\n1\n\n14\n8\n\n5\n5\n\n623\n\n0:>\n\n~\n\n"\'"\n\nTABLE 3.- SUMMARY OF DATA FROM 230 LABORATORY REPORTS ON FAILED COMPONENTS\n\nNumber of failures due to Classification\nof causes\n\nFatigue Overload\n\nTotals\nHigh\nStress corrosion Excessive wear\nStress\nCorrosion rupture temperature\nor hydrogen\nor deformation\noxidation\nem brittlement\nI\n15\n\n52\n\n18\n\nFabrication defects\n\n31\n\n6\n\nDesign deficiencies\n\n24\n\n5\n\n4\n\n1\n\nDefective material\n\n10\n\n3\n\n1\n\n13\n\n7\n\n11\n\n2\n41\n\n18\n\n1\n\n39\n\n1\n\n37\n\n1\n\n141\n\n102\n\n1\n\nUndeterminetl\n\n2\n\n1\n\nAbnormal service\ndamage\n\n4\n1\n\n11\n\nImproper maintenance\n\nTotals\n\n1\n\n1\n\n15\n23\n\n2\n\n14\n17\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n230\n\nCO\\J ,ECTS TO\n\'\nROTOR HUB\n\nCONNECTS TO MAIN\nROTOR BLAOE\n\nFATIGUE\n\noI A\n\n>\n\n4.5 \'1\n\nFigure 1.- Drawing of the failed main rotor spindle, showing the location of the fracture.\n\nFigure 2.- Appearance of the spindle fracture in the vicinity of the fatigue origin (arrowl.

N\'Guyen\nSociete Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale\nToulouse, France\nand\nJ. P. Perrais\nCentre d\'Essais Aeronautiques\nToulouse, France\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Concorde, a delta-shaped-wing aircraft, has been submitted to numerous material, attachment and protection tests since, with its structural design, it is capable of\nreaching supersonic speeds (Mach number, 2.05). In addition, this aircraft has been\ntested in the scope of structural engineering tests performed on substructures. In this\npaper, only development tests on large structure assemblies and airworthiness substantiation full-scale tests are considered.\nThis paper is limited to the tests performed at the Centre d\' Essais Aeronautiques\nof Toulouse (C.E.A.T.), France. The tests carried out in the United Kingdom are to be\npresented by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (R.A.E .). As a rule, the development\ntests achieved both in France and in the United Kingdom are usually performed on structures for which Aerospatiale and British Aircraft Corporation are responsible. All certification static tests are to be carried out in France and all certification fatigue tests are\nto be performed in the United Kingdom.\n\n/\n\nEXPERIENCE FROM STATIC TESTS\n\nTwo main sections have been submitted to pressure, mechanical load, and thermal\nstatic tests and are shown in figure l.\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nFuselage Section 1 bis.\n\nThe structure, named fuselage section 1 bis. or 1(a), consisted of a 4.68-meter-Iong\ntwin-looped cylindrical fuselage section including six standard frames and two main\nfrrmes. On both sides of the lower part of the fuselage, rectangular structural boxes\nrepresented the wing assembly and its fuselage junction section. The purpose of this\noperation was to create the same thermal stresses over this area as those encountered\n,\n631\n\nin flight. The skin panels (A - U2GN sheet) were attached in a classical way to the\nstringers and frames.\nThe aim of the tests was to observe the structural behaviour under the most severe\nflight conditions such as combined pressurization, fuselage torsion and loads on floor,\nand thermal stresses. Test measurements of temperatures and mechanical strains were\nalso compared with calculated values of thermal stresses in order to (1) justify design\nmethods, (2) make an analysis of the role played by thermal stresses among total stresses\n(to manage a test program of structures which will be tested in the future), and (3) perfect\nnew test methods, especially in the scope of infrared heating and air-cooling units\ninjecting liquid nitrogen. The tests started at the end of 1964 and ended in the spring\nof 1966.\nThis testing enabled the manufacturer to check for the thermal stress level in the\nfuselage areas hidden by the wing assembly and in the longitudinal stringers located at\nthe bottom of the fuselage. (Fig. 2 shows the results of comparative tests on the heated\nlower part and the unheated lower part to simulate the presence of a fuel tank.) It was\nnecessary to carry out tests, especially fatigue tests, by representing in a most accurate\nway thermal stresses where they are significant.\nSection 2.8.b\nThe test structure, section 2.8.b, was composed of a fuselage section (first definition of the aircraft, 10 m ;: : 35 ft long) and of main adjacent wing elements having an overall span of 44 ft. (Refer to fig. 1.) This structure is a genuine aircraft element. The\npurpose of the test was\n(1) To check in a more exact way the aircraft design methods. Therefore, the test\nstructure itself with its proposed end effects has been calculated by means of the same\nnetwork as an aircraft (analog electrical network for internal load computation).\n(2) To compare thermal stress distributions obtained from different aircraft missions. These distributions are not easily obtained by computation.\n(3) To evaluate fuel influence in the tanks on these thermal stresses.\n(4) To study the superimposition of cabin and tank pressure, of air and inertia\nloads, and thermal effects.\n(5) To prove the "fail-safe" characteristics of this structure by making some cuts\nto simulate cracks in the main spars, ribs, and frames, and then performing residualstrength tests.\n\n632\n\n(6) To familiarize test laboratories with exceedingly complex installations in order\nto proceed with the certification static tests on a full-scale aircraft structure (fig. 3)\nunder satisfactory conditions.\nThese tests commenced in the autumn of 1966 and ended in the summer of 1969.\nResults are too extensive to be presented in this paper. Therefore, only tests which\nmade it possible to perfect the fatigue test programs are presented.\nIt was shown by the design calculations that the maximum thermal stress values\n\nhighly depended upon the aircraft acceleration laws. This dependence was verified when\na few wing panels buckled locally during tests simulating missions with high acceleration\nand low take-off weight. (See fig. 4.) (It was a case of a flight corresponding to a previous definition of the aircraft.) The purely thermal stresses remain moderate in absolute value but are reversed, and their peak-to-peak values are significant. The presence\nof fuel causes the stresses in heavy parts of spars and ribs to be reduced. On the other\nhand, the internal skin surface is subjected to tensile thermal stresses when the fuel\ntank is empty. These tensile stresses add to the internal tensile stresses due to flight\nloads. The following conclusion may be drawn from this program. For tests on partial\nstructures, great care should be exercised in Simulating the temperature distributions\nover the fuselage internal areas (especially those areas hidden by wing assemblies). (The\nparasite end effects are very strong.)\nBecause of the high strength of the fuselage in the presence of large cuts (as\nrequired in the FAA fail-safe tests), fatigue tests can be safely conducted by using air to\ncyclically pressurize the fuselage.\nA few "dynamic-cut" tests which were performed on the fuselage throughout frames\nended the fail-safe tests; the data from these tests will be used for certification\nsubstantiation.\nSTATIC TESTS FOR AmWORTffiNESS SUBSTANTIATION\nThe test structure is a full-scale aircraft. The test program consists of a\nsequence of tests to be performed under room-temperature conditions and including five\ndifferent tests with loads on a part of the aircraft. All tests were conducted at least up\nto ultimate design load of the structure and some of them even beyond. The latter\nsequence of tests will be made under thermal conditions about July 1971 and will start\nwith thermal tests only, during which several aircraft missions will be achieved under\nrealistic conditions. In a first stage, to investigate ovens and cooling problems, C.E .A.T.\nwill use calculated temperatures which are being verified by means of flight measurements on the prototype. The test temperatures will be submitted to the Airworthiness\nAuthorities for approval. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate different static-test sequences.\n633\n\n- --\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n----\n\nFATIGUE TESTS\nThese tests have been performed on many structural components, but the test programs achieved by use of big substructures 2.3.2 and 2.6/2.7 (fig. 1) are by far the most\nsignificant.\nPreliminary static tests showed that it was necessary to reproduce the temperature\ndistributions during acceleration and deceleration sequences. When the fatigue test programs were initiated, it was found that this operation would require a test of long duration; the time cycle in the laboratory was almost equal to the time required for an actual\nflight. It was absolutely necessary to compromise some part of the test program in\norder to obtain some desired results for the structural behaviour within a reasonable\nperiod of time.\nTwo changes were made in the test program to compensate for accelerating the\nthermal tests: (1) To compensate for creep, normal structural temperature has been\nincreased by 20 0 C (from 1000 C to 1200 C), (2) To compensate for deteriorations due to\nthermal stresses, the heating rate d 8/dt has been increased during acceleration and\ndeceleration sequences in order to increase the stresses by 15 to 20 percent, depending\nupon particular components.\nIn order to a ccelerate testing, the time during which the external wall temperatures\nwere constant was decreased. Figure 7 shows that this decrease was feasible since\n(a) the same maximum temperatures were achieved as in actual flight for both external\nwall and internal structure, (b) the wall and structure returned to room temperature at\nthe end of the programed time cycle, and (c) the heating sequence during the time of constant temperature produced satisfactory thermal gradients during the deceleration\nsequence.\nOn the test section 2.3.2, this requirement was met by blowing hot or cold air onto\nfuselage areas hidden by the wing assembly. On test section 2.6/2.7, the same result\nwas obtained by injecting hot and cold liquid into the fuel tanks, as required. These procedures are called "complementary means."\nDetermination of Cycle\nRandom maneuver and gust loads were applied by lever jigs. For these development tests to be performed, it was preferable to reduce the typical loading spectrum to\nits simplest terms to investigate more easily the possible crack propagation rates. Pressure loads, since they are actually known, have been used at their flight true values; that\nis, p = 736 mb inside the cabin compartment, and p = 250 mb inside the fuel tanks.\nThermal stresses were increased 10 to 20 percent, depending upon the area, to accelerate\n\n634\n\nthe observance of the deteriorations due to thermal stresses. By using this increase, an\nattempt was made to double the damage value due to thermal stresses.\nThree mechanical and three pressure cycles were superposed on each thermal\nstress cycle. In one instance (A), the mechanical and the pressure cycles were applied\nsimultaneously while the thermal stresses were high. In two other instances (2B), the\nmechanical and pressure cycles were applied simultaneously while the thermal stresses\nwere small or nil (corresponding to a slow return to room temperature). This sequence\nof loading produced a threefold increase in damage due to the usual loads. Cycles\nC = A + 2B are performed one after the other.\nFinal Test Conditions\nFinal test conditions were based on and perfected from typical tests. During these\ntypical tests, the actual flight real time requirements were met in order to accurately\ndetermine the required heating rates and thermal stresses during a flight. Based on the\nresults of these typical tests, several short time cycles were tested and complementary\nmeans were used to obtain the desired temperature and stress evolution (especially\npeak-to-peak) at all significant measurement points. The complete time cycle of test\n2.3.2 is shown in figure 8; whereas the complete time cycle of test 2.6/2.7 is shown in\nfigure 9. It is easily noticed that with 1 hour\'S cycle (of which 40 minutes is thermal)\nfor 2.6/2.7 tests and that with a 34 minutes\' cycle (of which 26 minutes is thermal) twice\nthe thermal damage and three times the mechanical damage of a 3 hr 15 min flight is\nproduced.\nResults Obtained on Test Structure 2.6/2.7\nBy March 10, 1971, 9900 cycles (A + 2B) and 10 900 additional B cycles (representing purely subsonic flights) were applied. This stress history corresponds to the\ndamage caused by 40 600 flights under mechanical fatigue conditions and about\n19 800 flights under thermal fatigue conditions. The deteriorations that were noticed\noccurred on the (current) fuselage frames at the level of the cabin floor. They were due\nto a combination of pressurization and thermal cycles. As a result of these deteriorations, design improvements were made on partial assemblies representing the damaged\narea (fig. 10). In tests on these partial assemblies, a special fixture was used to simulate\nthe frame warping due to thermal stresses. The results of these tests were very satisfactory, and enabled an excellent behaviour of the frames to be foreseen on series\naircraft.\n\n635\n\nResults Obtained on Test Structure 2.3.2\nBy March 1, 1971, 14 000 complete cycles (A + 2B) and 4000 purely subsonic flights\nwere applied. This stress history corresponds to the damage caused by 46 000 flights\nunder mechanical fatigue conditions and about 28 000 flights under thermal fatigue conditions. The deteriorations that were noticed confirm those which were obtained with the\nsubstructure 2.6/2.7 , and indicated that the same design improvements were required.\nSome minor deteriorations were found in the door and emergency exit lOCking devices.\nThese deteriorations very likely come from local bending effects due to thermal stresses,\nand to defects in the door. A few cracks on metal sheets were detected and the investigation of the crack propagation rate is being made. Inside the wing fuel tanks, the original rods fitted with clevis welded by an electron bombardment process did not have a\nsuitable fatigue life and have been replaced by conventional design rods.\nResidual Strength Mter Deteriorations\nDeteriorations, especially those concerning fuselage frames, were always found\nduring the systematic inspection of the structures, that is, following completion of a program block including 1000 cycles (A + 2B) . The damaged structure exhibited satisfactory\nresidual strength during the last cycles of the program block.\nA flight limit load test upon occurrence of deteriorations has just been made on\nstructure 2.6/2.7; this test will be used for certification purposes. Figures 11 and 12\nillustrate the test rigs 2.3.2 and 2.6/2.7.\nCONCLUSIONS FROM DEVELOPMENT TESTS\nThe main conclusions are as follows:\n1. On a supersonic aircraft whose structure weight is a Significant part of the weight\n\nanalysis, many fatigue and static strength development tests should be made.\n2. Fatigue thermal tests are absolutely necessary. Temperature and thermal\nstress calculations, although they are very developed, cannot foresee any fatigue failures\ncaused by distortion incompatibilities which are not easily evaluated.\n\n636\n\n2.8. b\n\n2.3.2\n\nSTATIC TEST\n\nFATIGUE TEST\nFRENCH\n\nTEST\n\nCONCORDE\n\n2.6/2.7\nFATIGUE TEST\n\nSUBSTRUCTURES FOR\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nTESTS\n\nFigu re 1.\n\n637\n\nSTRINGER\nSTRESS)\ndaN/mm 2\n\nz\n\nksi\n\n\xc2\xb0C\n115\n100\n\n80\n\nSTRINGER\nTEMPERATURE\nWITH FUEL\n\n6\n\no\n~\nz\nw\n\nTEMPERATURE)\n\nSTRINGER TEMPERATURE\nWITHOUT FUEL\n\n4\n\n,-,\n__\n\n~2\n\n60\n\n"\\.\n\n"\\.\n-~-\n\n"-\n\n40\n20\n\no ~~--~~--~--~--~----~~~--~~~ o\n"\n3,000\n\n-2\n\\\n-4\n\\\\\no\n~ -6 :10\\\n\nSTRINGER THERMAL\n\nz\n\nw\n\ng:\n\n-8\n\nSTRESS WITH FUEL\n\n1\n\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0-10\nU\n-12\n\n./\n\n\\\n\n-20\n\n4,000\n\n\\\n\n"\'\n-"\n\n,,"\n\n/\n\n----- ---\n\ns,doo\n6,000\n7,000\nI TIME) seconds -20\n\'\nI\n\nI\n-)\n\n- - - - - -- - ,\nSTRINGER THERMAL\nSTRESS WITHOUT FUEL\n\nSTRUCTURE 1 bis -EFFECT OF THE FUEL ON LONGITUDINAL THERMAL\nSTRESSES ON A BOTTOM STRINGER OF A FUSELAGE FUEL TANK\nFigu re 2.\n\n638\n\n2.

It\nattempts to complete the overall picture provided by other papers which primarily\ndeal with testing of the remainder of the Concorde airframe.\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring this symposium, much information has been presented on the structural\ntesting of Concorde. In particular, paper no. 1 by E . L. Ripley, given as the Third\nFrederick J. Plantema Memorial Lecture, deals extensively with the Concorde airframe major fatigue test and similar development tests on fuselage components.\nPaper no. 20 by V. P. N\'Guyen and J. P. Perrais gives a summary of the Concorde\nmajor airframe static test and other large fuselage" wing component tests at the Centre d\'Essais Aeronautiques de Toulouse (C.E.A.T.) in France.\nTo complete the picture, the present paper gives an account in general terms of\na series of tests being carried out in the United Kingdom (U.K.) on Concorde nacelle\ncomponents. These components are relatively large structural elements (e.g., the\nintake is 3.5 by 7 by 17 feet) subject to unique types of loading and involving novel\nforms of design and construction. They are designed to meet the full static strength,\nfail-safe, and fatigue requirements of the basic airframe and, thus, have to be the\nsubject of a complete certification test programme. In this sense, they must be considered as a complementary part of the major static and major fatigue test\nprogrammes.\nSYMBOLS\nM\n\nMach number\n\nn\n\nmanoeuvering load factor\n649\n\n----\n\n-----~~\n\ndesign cruiSing speed\ndesign diving speed\nDESCRIPTION OF NACELLE STRUCTURAL SPECIMENS\nA supersonic aircraft, such as Concorde, requires a sophisticated power-plant\ninstallation, including a variable-geometry intake with its own automatic-control system,\nan engine bay providing full accessibility, and a variable - geometry nozzle incorporating\nthrust reversers. A general view of the complete Concorde nacelle is shown in figure 1,\nand a more detailed description of the specimens is given in the appendix.\nPart of the basic philosophy for the production nacelle structure has been to design\nthe three main components - intake, engine bay, and nozzle - as separate units linked\ntogether in a statically determinate manner to minimise redundant interaction forces\narising because of wing distortions. For the same reason, the engine bay itself has been\ndesigned in two halves - a forward bay and a rear bay - simply spigoted together at the\njoint.\nAdvantage has been taken of this design philosophy to reduce the complexity of\ntesting; thus, the air intake was tested separately from the engine bay and nozzle, and the\nforward engine... bay was tested independently of the rear engine bay.\nA summary of the nacelle structural test specimens either tested or to be tested\nas part of the Concorde development and certification programme is given in table 1 for\nthe intake and in table 2 for the engine bay and nozzle.\nAn additional production nozzle specimen is also being provided, and will be tested\n\nunder operating environmental conditions behind a pair of Olympus engines installed in a\ntest bed at Societe Nationale d \'Etude et de Construction de Moteur d\'Aviation (SNECMA)\nin France.\nPROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH INTAKE TESTING\nSummary of Loading Actions\nThe primary loading action on the intake results from internal pressures due to the\nairflow through the ducts. The internal pressures due to two typical operating conditions\nare shown in figure 2. Since part of the top of the intake is closed by the lower surface\nof the wing, these pressures produce significant loads in the wing-nacelle attachment\nlinks, as well as designing the intake shell. Additional loading in intake and links is due\nto the interaction forces at the links due to wing distortions.\n650\n\nDuring supersonic cruise conditions, the intake is also subjected to elevated temperatures with the internal temperature reaching a maximum of 125 0 to 1300 C and the\nexternal temperature a value of 1000 C. Because both inside and outside surfaces are\nsubjected to similar forcing conditions, thermal stresses during acceleration and deceleration are, in general, less than those produced by the cruise temperature gradients\nquoted previously.\nTest Realisation\nFor all three intake test specimens, the approach to the problem of simulating wing\ninteraction loads and pressure loads is the same. To represent Wing-nacelle interaction\nloads, the specimens are mounted from a rigid test frame by links at the points A, C, E,\nand G shown in figure 1. Each link is then calibrated to enable the link-reaction load to\nbe measured. Three remaining links (points B, D, and F) are attached to hydraulic jacks\nwhich are controlled to apply specified displacements.\nThe representation of the varying pressure distributions within the ducts has been a\nmajor difficulty. The interior of the specimen was divided into four main zones, with a\nfifth zone representing the boundary-layer bleed between the wing and the forward part of\nthe intake. (See fig. 2.). Between adjacent zones a pressure seal has had to be developed\nin such a way that while maintaining the interzone pressure differentials, local loading and\nrestraint to specimen movement have been avoided. The final solution, following extensive development, has led to the design of flexible suction seals mounted off a central\ncore rigidly supported by the test frame. The assembly of one such core for the roomtemperature tests on specimen 2.9B is shown in figure 3.\nFor the thermal testing on specimen 2.9.4, the specimen has to be heated cyclically\ninside and outside. Each internal zone is thus supplied with pressurized air through a\nseparate closed-circuit system of ducts with outlets into the specimen through the central\ncore. The heating of this air is controlled through a heat exchanger. For cooling, the\ncircuit is depressurized and switched to open circuit; ambient air is then blown through\nthe specimen. The exterior of the specimen is surrounded by a duct through which\nunpressurized air is blown at the requisite temperatures. This system, which is duplicated for each intake duct, results in an extremely complex facility. A scale model of\nthis facility is shown in figure 4.\nWith this facility it is possible to simulate adequately the major loading actions. In\nthe fatigue test, advantage is taken of the absence of Significant climb and descent thermal\nstresses by shortening the thermal cycle to simulate only cruise gradients and imposing a\ntest cruise time of 12 minutes compared with an average aircraft cruise time of 75 minutes. To compensate for this shorter test time at temperature, creep rate is increased\nby a factor of approximately 5 by increasing maximum test temperatures 15 0 C. The\n651\n\nproposed test cycle is shown in figure 5. The aim is to achieve a rate of testing comparable with the major airframe fatigue test (where each 1-hour test cycle simulates the\ndamage done in two typical aircraft supersonic flights).\nPROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ENGINE-BAY AND NOZZLE TESTING\nSummary of Loading Actions\nThe loading actions on the engine bay and nozzle are similar to those on the intake,\nbut there are some significant differences which are summarized below:\n(1) The distribution of pressure in the engine bay and nozzle is essentially constant;\nthus, only one internal-pressure zone is required in each duct.\n(2) The concentrated system of hydraulic jacks required to represent reverse-\n\nthrust bucket loads, bucket operating jack loads, and engine jet pipes leads to local complications in the heating, cooling, and pressurisation system.\n(3) The maximum operating temperatures in the rear engine bay and nozzle are\nhigh, reaching about 240 0 C in the engine bay and between 320 0 and 410 0 C in the nozzle ;\nas in the intake, a steady gradient is present during cruise causing Significant thermal\nstresses. In addition, large transient thermal gradients arise in the nozzle centre-wall\nstructure during descent and due to reheat in the climb and result in another thermalstress cycle. These temperatures are shown diagrammatically in figure 6.\nTest Realisation\nTwo of the engine-bay specimens (specimen 1.11.2.2 and specimen 2.9.4.2) are\nrelatively simple; tests on these specimens involve static pressure and mechanical\nloading at room temperature. Specimen 2.9.4.3 is subjected to a pressure fatigue test\nat elevated temperature. This test poses no serious problems apart from the control and\nmonitoring of temperature and the timing of the pressure cycle to ensure a consistent\naccumulation of creep and fatigue damage.\nThe fourth specimen, specimen 2.9.6, is subjected to both static and fatigue testing\nwith representation of thermal conditions. This testing requires a complex test facility\nsimilar to that for the intake shown in figure 4. The simulation of wing distortions and\nbay pressures is done in a similar manner to that for the intake; the number of pressure\nzones is less, but seal design is complicated by the higher temperatures required.\nIn order to limit the test temperatures, advantage is taken of the fact that thermal\nstress due to temperature gradient is the most Significant requirement since creep and\nmaterial degradation at the aircraft temperature levels are unimportant for the stainless\nsteel materials of the nozzle bay and the titanium and inconel alloys of the engine bay.\n652\n\nThe required temper .\nrrradients of about 250 0 C maximum through the nozzle side. by blowing air at room temperature over the outside of the\nwalls are therefore o.\nspecimen and blowing hot ~\nfrom the rear to the front through the inside. A special\nproblem arises in simulatir.; t1 temperature gradients through the centre wall of the\nnozzle during descent and duf\' \' , reheat in the climb.\nTo achieve these in as -,nort a time as possible, a special system is provided to\nblow alternately hot and cold air into the centre wall void. This system is switched on at\nappropriate times in the cycle, thus enabling the required cruise and recovery equilibrium conditions to be rapidly achieved. (See fig. 7.) A diagram of the fatigue cycle\nachieved with this forcing system is shown in figure 8; the target, as in the case of the\nintake, is to achieve a rate of testing comparable with the major airframe fatigue test.\nTEST CONTROL\nBoth the intake (specimen 2.9.4) fatigue test and the engine-bay and nozzle (specimen 2.9.6) fatigue test are to be controlled and monitored by a single IBM 1800 computer,\nwhich will also provide data logging and both on-line and off-line data analysis and\ndisplay.\nThe monitoring facility checks the applied values of all control variables with the\nrequired values against a set of inner and outer limits; the inner limit exceedances are\nprinted-out and the outer limit exceedances cause shutdown of the test.\nA general view of this installation is shown in figure 9, and a flow diagram illustrating the control logic of the test facility is shown in figure 10.\n\n653\n\nAPPENDIX\nDESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTION NACELLE STRUCTURE\nAir - Intake Structure\nA structural breakdown of the intake is shown in figure 11. The operating temperature during Mach 2.0 cruise is approximately 120 0 C, and aluminium alloy is used for\nall the structure with the exception of the rear frame (frame 204), which is made from\ntitanium alloy to provide a fireproof bulkhead. The forward lip, the forward- and centreduct skins, and the intake frames are mostly machined from thick plate. The moveable\nramps are made from aluminium alloy honeycomb.\nThe intake is suspended from the wing at six points, with a forward and rear attachment on each of the three walls. Five of the attachments are simple links taking vertical\nloads only; the sixth, at the centre of the rear frame, is a fixed-point attachment taking\nloads in all planes. A secondary horizontal link is also provided on the forward centre\nwall to provide yawing restraints.\nEngine - Bay Structure\nThe general arrangement of the engine bay can be seen from figure 1. Since the\nengines are mounted directly from the wing, engine-bay loads derive predominantly from\ninternal pressures. The bay consists of a forward and rear section, simply spigotted\ntogether; each section consists of a fixed centre wall with an L-shaped door forming the\nside and bottom walls of each bay. The front and rear bulkheads of the bay are formed\nby the rear frame of the intake and the front frame of the nozzle-fixed structure,\nrespectively.\nThe centre wall (see fig. 12) has a maximum operating temperature of 250 0 C and\nmust resist flame temperatures of up to 11000 C for 5 minutes. Thus, both front and\nrear sections are made from a nickel alloy (Inconel 718) honeycomb-sandwich panel.\nThe forward doors (see fig. 13) have a maximum operating temperature of 1500 C\nand are made from aluminium alloy. Inner and outer skins are riveted and spot-welded,\nrespectively, to close-pitched frames of the extruded I-section. The rear doors (shown\nin fig. 14), where maximum operating temperatures are about 200 0 C, are of similar construction but made of titanium alloy with the frames either machined from bar or fabricated from welded plate. Both sets of doors are provided with fore and aft sliding freedom of about 30 mm along a line near the door corner. This freedom has been provided\nto eliminate large interaction forces between the wing and door which would otherwise\narise because of wing distortions in flight. The slide also incorporates a hinge, so that\n\n654\n\nAPPENDIX\nit is possible to open the bottom part of the door independently for simple servicing.\nAlso to avoid interaction forces due to distortion, the doors are supported from two\nhinges, at the front and rear of the top edge only. Intermediate hinges are provided but\nare designed to only restrain the door against lateral pressure forces.\nNozzle structure\nThe general arrangement of the nozzle fixed structure is shown in figure 15. The\nmaximum operating temperature of the structure is in the region of 4500 C, and for this\nregion stainless steel is the basic structural material.\nThe basic structure is made up of a pair of barrels forming the main ducts, supported by spectacle frames and enclosed by an outer fairing. These components are\nmainly fabricated from stainless steel stresskin honeycomb. Upper and lower fore and\naft longerons run between the inner barrels and outer fairings in the sidewalls and centre\nwalls. These form the primary load path for the reverser bucket loads; these buckets\nare attached to hinge fittings which connect with the aft end of these longerons.\nThis fixed structure is attached to the engine-bay-wing interface at three nonredundant fittings, one on each sidewall and one on the centre wall. A fourth attachment\nat the centre wall is provided as a fail-safe standby. The main centre-wall attachment\nconnects with the engine-bay centre wall, the two sidewall attachments connecting with a\npair of triangulated frames attached to the wing undersurface.\nProvision in the fixed structure is made for attaching the engine primary nozzle by\nmeans of three spigot fittings projecting into the main ducts. Additional attachments are\nprovided for the reverser-bucket operating jacks, four in each duct.\n\n655\n\n0)\n\n01\n\n0)\n\nTABLE 1.- INTAKE MAJOR STRUCTURAL TEST SPECIMENS\nDescription\n\nSummary of test requirements\n\nRemarks\nStatic\n\nSpecimen 2.9B\n(prototype air\nintake)\n\nA twin left-hand intake\nto prototype standard.\nRig applies internal\npressure in four zones per\nduct with wing distortions.\n\nFail-safe\n\nFatigue\n\nStatic design cases at room\ntemperature up to 85 % ultimate\nload to clear prototype flying .\nTest cases include\n(1) Symmetric and asymmetric\n\nsurge cases\n(2) Ground running manoeuvre\ncases at YD.\nSpecimen 2.9.4\n(production\nair-intake\nfatigue\nspecimen)\n\nA twin right-hand\nintake to preproduction\nstandard.\nRig applies internal and\nexternal heating in association\nwith internal pressure in four\ninternal zones .

H. Hooke\nAeronautical Research Laboratories\nDepartment of Supply\nCommonwealth of Australia\nSUMMARY\nBoth the conventional and reliability analyses for determining safe fatigue life\nare predicated on a population having a specified (usually log normal) distribution of\nlife to collapse under a fatigue test load.\nUnder a random service load spectrum, random occurrences of load larger than\nthe fatigue test load may confront and cause collapse of structures which are weakened,\nthough not yet to the fatigue test load. These collapses are included in reliability but\nexcluded in conventional analysis.\nThe theory of risk determination by each method is given, and several reasonably\ntypical examples have been worked out, in which it transpires that if one excludes\ncollapse through exceedance of the uncracked strength, the reliability and conventional\nanalyses gave virtually identical probabilities of failure or survival.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe conventional approach to safe-life estimation envisages a fatigue test which\nimposes on at least one full-scale structure the equivalent fatigue damaging effect of\nservice loading, according to some regular pattern which restricts, however, the\nlargest load, regularly applied, to some fraction of the virgin strength. Life to\ncollapse is regarded as a statistical variable, of whose population mean the test failure\nis treated as an estimator. Variability is estimated from other representative experiments in which each member\'s strength falls to a single lower value (in different lifetimes), which is accounted failure, and the probability density function of life to failure\nis usually assumed log normal.\n\n.\n\nDetermination of the safe life as a function of desired or acceptable probability\nof failure requires merely the estimation of the desired percentile of the population,\nthat is, the desired percentile of the distribution of fatigue lives, measured to the point\nat which each member \' s strength has fallen to the largest applied load in the test\nsequence.\n667\n\nReliability theory, applied to this problem attributes the same strength properties\nto the population as before, including the decay of strength as fatigue crack growth occurs,\nbut does not assume that collapse occurs when each member\'s strength has fallen to a\ncommon value. Collapse occurs rather when a member of the population meets a load\nlarger than its current strength, and this event would correspond to a conventionally\nassessed life for that member if the service spectrum were modified or truncated so that\nall load peaks larger than the fatigue test load were reduced to that value.\nThe purpose of this study was to present the theory of risk determination for each\nmethod and to ascertain by the working of several reasonably typical examples whether\nthe conventional method significantly underestimated the failure risk through ignoring\nservice loads higher than the fatigue test load.\nSYMBOLS\nb\n\nratio of maximum fatigue test load to virgin strength or strength at critical\ncrack length\n\ng\n\nratio of crack propagation time (from detectable to critical size) to total\nlife H\n\nH\n\npopulation life in hours; a log normal random variable\n\nH\n\npopulation geometric mean life in hours\n\nl\n\ncrack length\n"critical" crack length at which strength U has fallen to bUo\ncrack length detectable with certainty\n\nm{V)\n\nfrequency of occurrence, per hour, of applied load >V\n\nn\n\nnumber of load cycles applied\n\np{U)\n\nprobability density function of strength for population\n\np{V)\n\nprobability density function for applied load V for some arbitrary time\ninterval\n\n668\n\nP(t)\n\nprobability of collapse before time t\n\nP(n)\n\nprobability of collapse before nth applied load\n\nPc\n\nprobability of collapse in arbitrary time interval\n\noP c\n\nprobability of collapse in arbitrary time interval of small element of population characterised by its value of H\n\nr(t)\n\nrisk or risk rate or risk of failure at time t of survivors at time t\n\nr(n)\n\nrisk or rate of failure at the nth applied load of survivors of (n-l)th load\n\nR(t)\n\nreliability at time t or probability of survival to time t\n\nR(n)\n\nreliability at nth applied load or probability of survival from first to (n-l)th\nload\n\nt\n\ntime, hours\n\nTb\n\nsafe inspection period for probability of failure p\n\nU\n\nstrength\n\nUo\n\nvirgin strength\n\nV\n\napplied load\n\na\n\nstandard deviation of log H\n\n1>\n\nstrength decay function of crack size\n\ntJ;\n\ncrack propagation (time function)\n\n=p\n\npercent of gH\n\nSTATISTICAL MODEL AND SAFE-LIFE ANALYSES\n\nThe statistical model used herein is the one used in references 1 and 2, as shown\nin figure 1 in both normal and logarithmic coordinates, and has the following features:\n\n669\n\n(1) The population life H is log normally distributed with geometric mean H\nand variance a2 , H being the hours in which the strength U is reduced from Uo to\nbUo which corresponds to the largest load in the test spectrum.\n(2) Crack propagation in each member is scaled to the member\'S potential life to\n\nfailure H under the specified test history and follows the expression\n_l\nlcr\n\n= lj;(!:..)\n\\II\n\n(3) Strength is related to crack size; thus,\n\nand the condition (1) gives\n\n<1>(1)\n\n= b.\n\n(4) Whereas crack propagation is governed by condition (2), failure is governed by\n\nthe frequency of occurrence m(V) per hour, of service loads exceeding V, or in nondimensional terms, the frequency m(V /U o ) of service loads greater than V / Uo \'\nIn conventional analYSiS, a safe life for a probability of failure p is merely the\np percentile of the variable H. Insofar as H is the time at which U falls to Uo,\nit is independent of the shape of the crack propagation curve and is only dependent on the\ntime H at which l = lcr.\nThe calculation of failure by the reliability approach requires the following definitions (refs. 4 and 5):\nP{t)\n\nprobability of fracture before time t\n\nR{t)\n\nreliability at time t or probability of survival to time t\n\nr{t)\n\nrisk or rate of failure at time t of survivors to time t, _1_ dP{t)\nR{t) dt\n\nand the expression\n-It r{t)dt\nR{t) = e 0\n\n(1)\n\nOr, alternatively, the probability of failure before a given time, the reliability and the\nrisk (hazard rate or force of mortality) may be expressed as a function of number of\ncycles n, as P{n), R{n), and r{n). In this case r{n) dn is the probability of failure\n670\n\nin dn cycles of members surviving at n cycles, so that (With dn = 1), r(n)\nprobability of failure per cycle of members which survive to the nth cycle.\n\nis the\n\nIf the probability density functions of strength and of load occurring in some arbi-\n\ntrary time are p(U)\n\nand p(V), respectively, as shown in the following diagram,\n\nProbability\ndensity\n\np(U)\n\nStrength U\n\n~\n\nAppl ied load V\nthen the probability of collapse in this arbitrary time is the probability that a load V\nfalls on a structure of strength U less than V.

Thus gH is log normally\ndistributed with median gH and variance 0-2 .\nIn conventional analysis, the critical length lcr is the same for all members of\nthe population, and the unsafe value of strength is equated to b Uo , the highest load in the\nfatigue test programme. A safe operating period after inspection Tb for a probability\nof failure p in the interval is the p percentile of the variable crack propagation\ntime gH, since it can readily be seen that only p percent of cracks can propagate from\nld to lcr in a time less than Tb\' This result assumes that all structures are cracked\nto just below ld at the inspection date, and it is seen to be independent of the shape of\nthe crack propagation curve for cracks smaller than ld\'\nIn reliability analysis, structures may be conSidered to be cracked to just below ld\nat the beginning of the propagation time but to reach a failure state governed by load\nexceeding strength. Where the safe lives, as calculated by reliability and conventional\nmethods, coincide it is concluded that this will imply a coincidence of the values of safe\ninspection intervals.\nAPPLICATION OF THE THEORY TO TYPICAL EXAMPLES\nExample A(l) represents a military aircraft situation where the structures are subjected to the manoeuvre load spectrum (curve A of fig. 2) in which limit load is exceeded\nonce per 100 hours, crack size l / lcr is a power function of t / H, the decay of strength\nwith crack size conforms to the laws of fracture mechaniCS , and the standard deviation 0is 0.167.\nExample A(2) represents the same situation as example A(l) except that the standard deviation a is 0.16712.\nExample B(l) represents a civil aircraft situation where the structures are subjected to the gust spectrum (curve B of fig. 2) in which three-fourths of limit load is\nexceeded once in 5000 hours, crack propagation follows figure 28 of reference 3, the\ndecay of strength is a linear function of crack length, and the standard deviation is 0.17.\nExample B(2) represents the same situation as example B(l) except that (perhaps\nunrealistically) crack growth is assumed linear from zero time up to failure.\n\n673\n\nConstants used in the various calculations are listed in table I, and the results of\nthe calculations are shown in figure 3 where probability of failure or survival is plotted\nagainst life in hours. Calculations for the conventional analysis have been made with the\nsame computer programme by truncating the load spectra at b Uo \'\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS\nExamination of figure 3 shows that for the Civil example B(l) both methods of\nanalysis gave virtually identical results within the computed range from p = 0.001 to\np = 0.999. In the computations the distribution of H was divided into its 0.1 percentile.\nIf results are desired for p < 0.001 these can readily be obtained by computing with\nsmaller elements of the distribution of H. For example A(l), both methods gave virtually identical probabilities of failure for lifetimes longer than 3000 hours, but for shorter\nlifetimes the reliability method gave higher probabilities than the conventional method.\nIt is appreciated that the reliability method of analysis included, whereas the conventional\nmethod excluded, the risk of failure from loads exceeding the virgin strength (whether of\nuncracked structure or of cracked but yet unweakened structure).\nThe probability of such overload failures can readily be derived from the frequency\nof exceedance of Uo for example A, namely once per million hours. This probability of\noverload failures is plotted as a dashed line in figure 3; the reliability calculation closely\napproximates this curve at low probabilities of failure.\nThe result for example A(2) is similar to that for example A(l), except that, because\nof the larger scatter, the reliability calculation assessed a given probability to have been\nreached in a slightly shorter lifetime; for example, a probability of failure of 0.002 was\nreached in 1500 hours by reliability analysis and in 1750 hours by conventional analysis\nwith the corresponding scatter factors being . ~ and\nrespectively. Again, at a probability of failure of 0.001, the major contribution was overload failure through loads\ngreater than the virgin strength.\n\n4,\n\nReliability analysis provides a rigorous method for validating the conventional\nmethods of safe life and inspection interval analyses which are based upon a seemingly\narbitrary choice of the value of unsafe strength, this choice having been made by choosing\nwhat is to be the highest load in the fatigue test programme on the representative structure to estimate mean life. The conventional analysis is vastly less time consuming than\nthe reliability analysis, since it involves a simple slide-rule calculation rather than a\ncomplex digital computer programme run.\nExamples A(l), A(2), and B(l) were constructed to represent closely conditions\nexisting in military and civil aircraft situations. For the most part the reliability analysis validates the Simpler conventional analysiS. For the military type of spectrum and at\n674\n\nshort lives, the probability of failure is dominated by loads exceeding the uncracked\nstrength; when these are added to the conventional analysis, the result agrees closely\nwith the reliability methods.\nExample B(2) represents an artificial extreme example of a structure assumed to\nhave linearly decaying strength from zero time up to failure. Nevertheless, here again,\nat probabilities of failure less than 20 percent, the corresponding lifetimes were virtually\nidentical with those for a more usual strength-decay curve , or, indeed, for the stepfunction strength decay curve which is implicit in the conventional analysis.\nThe examples that have been discussed have not considered the case of a long\nperiod of detectable crack propagation during which the strength does not decay below\nvirgin strength. Here inspection will not prevent failures from exceedance of the virgin\nstrength, but will weed out cracked structures before they become weakened.\nCONC L USIONS\nFor a range of conditions which are typical of military and civil aircraft structures\nand load histories, reliability analysis validates the much simpler conventional methods\nof safe life and inspection interval analysis.\nThe reliability method, ipso facto, includes the probability of failure through loads\nexceeding the virgin strength - a factor which is inevitable by any fatigue analYSiS,\ninspection schedule, or safe-life determination.\nWhere there is a long detectable crack propagation time without diminution of the\nstructural strength, inspection will weed out cracked structures before they become\nweakened but will not prevent failures from loads exceeding the virgin strength.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe author desires to gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Mr. M.
