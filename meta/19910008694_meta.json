The Flight research instrument system will make non-intrusive multicomponent velocity measurements of the vortical flow field around an aircraft in flight. The DGV will provide a means to obtain airborne experimental data to evaluate and refine computational fluid dynamic models and to correlate with wind-tunnel data sets. The primary use of the instrument system will be to provide a flexible research tool to map the 3D velocity field at various locations around an aircraft during high angle-of-attack maneuvers at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic speeds. Other potential applications may include shock definition and interactions, external stores flow interactions, rotary flow field definition, non-steady flow field definition, measurement of inlet and duct flow field, and measurement of hypersonic flow field in flight.", "title": "Doppler global velocimetry", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910008694, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Usry, Jim"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "2a93572e4f6a433e81db474d000c1e22"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910008694, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910008694, "id": "d778ec6a0a9a4bd8ba3626f20cd985c5", "publicationName": "Wichita State Univ., Proceedings: Techfest 17", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910008694.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910008694/downloads/19910008694.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910008694/downloads/19910008694.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910008694/downloads/19910008694.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
