b'Round Trip Review Process\nImprovement\n\nSaid Belhadj Software System Engineer,\nMM-MIS, MBA\nHuntsville AL\n\nRound Trip Review Process Improvement from the Discipline(Enterprise\nView) to the Activity (Project View)\n\nA Gap in the Review: Root Cause of accidents\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AECL \xe2\x80\x98s Therac 25 Radiation Machine involved in six radiation\noverdose accidents.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 First Root Cause cited : AECL did not have the software code\nindependently reviewed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cFatal Defect\xe2\x80\x9d book cites the UI Code was in one man\xe2\x80\x99s head\n\nhttps://medium.com/swlh/software-architecture-therac-25-the-killer-radiation-machine-8a05e0705d5b\n\nSoftware Industry relies heavily on Reviews\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Google, Facebook and Microsoft adopt reviews, at Microsoft\ndevelopers actively practice code reviews (Process Aspects and\nSocial Dynamics of Contemporary code Review IEEE)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 50,000 Microsoft developers actively practice code reviews\n\xe2\x80\xa2 How much can the software safety critical learn from the\nsoftware business critical ?\n\nReview is a lower cost quality provider\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reviews are lower-cost quality providers: \xe2\x80\x9cCode Review would\nhave saved half the cost of fixing bugs\xe2\x80\x9d (Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code\nReview, J Cohen 2006)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 With small effort (i.e 10%) used in defect prevention activities(ie\ndesign and code reviews) almost one third of all defects could\nbe removed --- The time required for testing was cut by 50%\n(IEEE The Personal Software Process: Experiences from Denmark)\n\nImproving, Reviewing, Evaluating The Review\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Review activity/process needs to be reviewed as any other\nactivity/process in the project life cycles and across projects\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The review process in the firma as any other is subjected to changes in\nworkforce, in management and in technology?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I believe that the Review Process become an Enterprise Discipline in its\nown right i.e. a concern and a focus at the programmatic/mid management\nlevel.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I believe that the Review Process as any benefits from recent studies in\nDesign Thinking or Artificial Intelligence and even Neurology\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This presentation will focus on the Review as a Discipline and Activity to\nbenefit the whole Enterprise\n\nReviews As Project Quality Gates\n\nRQT\n\nDES\n\nCODE\n\nTEST\n\nReview Space, Single Loops, Double\nLoops\nDR\n\n=\nDR: Discipline

Review Flow and Review docs-formats\nCRO as Observer: travels to the projects and behaves more observer and\nnot controller to rebuild wisdom in process\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Review part of Gemba(1): Review
