Previous analyses have typically solved this problem either by using numerical techniques or by computing a catalog of suitable trajectories. The invariant manifolds of a selected set of libration orbits and unstable resonant orbits are computed here to serve as guides for desirable approach trajectories. The analysis focuses on designing an approach phase that may be tied into the final resonance in the endgame sequence while also targeting desired conditions at the moon.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130000292, "endDate": "2012-02-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "22nd AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting", "location": "Charleston, SC", "id": "0e5c3562844a4e2a9d38db7803669cf1", "startDate": "2012-01-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130000292, "id": "48157a826ab94560a2ca862119030264", "publicationDate": "2012-01-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
