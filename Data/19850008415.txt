Werner\nAmes Research Center\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis paper describes the scientific and technical background and prospects for\nthe Space Infrared Telescope Facility, SIRTF. SIRTF is a superfluid-helium-cooled,\n0.85-meter infrared telescope to be placed in orbit in 1993. It will carry out\nphotometry over the wavelength range 2 to 700 ~m, and diffraction-limited imagery in\neither broad or narrow spectral bands over the range 1.8 to 200 ~m, down to flux\nlevels of 10- 6 janskys at 2 ~m, about 10- 4 janskys in the range 15 to 200 ~m and\n10- 2 janskys at 700~. These fluxes are up to 104 times fainter than currently\nachievable levels. SIRTF will measure spectra in the range 2.5 to 200 ~ with\nresolving power between 50 and 1000. The focal plane will contain about 20,000\ndetector elements, both discrete and in arrays, which will operate at sensitivity\nlevels set by the astrophysical background. SIRTF will be a long-lived (~10 yr)\nfacility providing opportunities for general investigations by the entire scientific\ncommunity.\nSIRTF will be ideal for following up the all-sky survey carried out by the\nInfrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). SIRTF can do a deep survey to flux levels\n5000 times fainter than IRAS and obtain spectra of even the faintest IRAS sources.\nSIRTF will provide powerful capabilities for the study of astrophysical problems\nranging from the formation of planetary systems and the nature of the Sun\'s nearest\nneighbors to the formation of galaxies in the early universe.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA recent headline in the New York Times was, "The Golden Age of Astronomy Peers\nto the Edge of the Universe." Underneath were artists\' conceptions of four space\nfacilities that are major components of this golden age--the Gamma Ray Observatory\n(GRO), the Hubble Space Telescope (ST), the Advanced X-Ray Astronomy Facility\n(AXAF), and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF). This paper describes\nthe fourth of these facilities, SIRTF. SIRTF is a l-meter-class, long-duration,\nsuperfluid-helium-cooled telescope in Earth orbit, equipped with imaging and\n\n*This paper is based on presentations by F. Gilbert at the 164th Meeting of the\nAmerican Astronomical Society, June 1984, and by M. Werner at the Kuiper Airborne\nObservatory 10th Anniversary Symposium, July 1984.\ntKitt Peak National Observatory, Tucson, Arizona 85721.\n\nspectroscopic instrumentation operating over the wavelength range 1.8 to 700 ~m.\nWe will show that SIRTF is the next step scientifically; it will be by far the most\npowerful tool available for studying many of the most compelling problems in\ncontemporary astrophysics and for further exploring the richness and variety of the\ninfrared sky demonstrated by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Second, we\nwill show that SIRTF is the next step technically; this enormous gain in scientific\ncapability does not imply a similar jump in technological capability, but builds on\nour current capabilities and flight-demonstrated critical technologies. The SIRTF\nstudies have progressed to the point of readiness for the detailed definition and\ndesign of the facility and instruments.\n\nSETTING THE STAGE FOR SIRTF\n\nOver the past 20 years, as infrared astronomy has grown and matured, many of\nthe techniques used in the infrared--telescopes, spectrometers, photometers, filters, and observing techniques--have been adapted from optical astronomy. There\nare, however, two areas of technological development unique to the infrared. The\nfirst is detection devices. The development and evolution of detectors for infrared\nastronomy have advanced to the pOint that, for most applications in the 3- to 200-~m\nrange, detector noise no longer limits instrument performance. In addition, the\nlast few years have seen the beginning of a revolution in infrared astronomy with\nthe initial availability of self-scanned arrays. This development is very important\nto SIRTF and will be discussed in more depth later.\n\n)\n\nThe second area of development unique to the infrared is that of cryogenically\ncooled space telescopes. Thermal emission by an ambient-temperature telescope and\nby the atmosphere, and atmospheric absorption, greatly limit the range and sensitivity of observations at infrared wavelengths beyond 2 ~m from ground-based, airborne, or balloon-borne telescopes. Observations from above the atmosphere open up\nthe entire infrared wavelength range, and cooling the telescope to cryogenic temperatures allows observations at a sensitivity level limited only by the natural astrophysical background. In the 1- to 100-~m range, this background is due to scattered\nsunlight and thermal emission from the zodiacal dust particles. Beyond about\n100~,\nemission from interstellar dust grains and the 2.7 K cosmic background are\nexpected to be dominant. Over the critical 5- to 200-~ wavelength range, the\nnatural background is about 10 7 times lower than the atmospheric and telescope background emission typical of previous infrared measurements (fig. 1). Since the\nlimiting noise varies as the square root of the background, a cryogenic space\ntelescope can bring a gain of more than a thousand in sensitivity for infrared\nobservations.\nThe first major space facility to exploit this gain was IRAS. IRAS, a joint\nproject of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, carried out\nan all-sky survey in four broad wavelength bands between 8 and 120~. The success\nof this project is very important to SIRTF both scientifically and technically.\nScientifically, IRAS showed the richness and variety of the sources available for\n2\n\n10-3\n\n....\nI\n\n10-4\n\n..\'\n\nE\n\nIii\n\n::I.\n\n....\n...\n\n10- 5\n\nN\n\n10-6\n\nI\n\n..\n\n!!!\n\nI\n\nE\nu\n\n, ,- .... ,\n\n,\n, ,,\n\n,\n,\n\n" 3.35 km\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nI\n\n,\\\n, .... _...... /,,\n\n, 29.1 km i"\\\n\nI\nI\nI\n\n\\\n\nlv, ,\n\n::. 10- 7\nu\nz\n:! 10-8\n\n\\\n\nw\n\nc\nc:(\n\n~\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n10-9\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10\n20\nWAVELENGTH,lIm\n\n40\n\n60 80 100\n\nFigure 1.- The natural astrophysical background (lower curve) in the infrared is\ncompared with the background caused by atmospheric emission as seen by groundbased and suborbital telescopes at various altitudes.\nstudy by a cryogenically cooled space telescope. The IRAS catalogs will provide the\nfundamental information about the sky that is crucial to the best use of SIRTF. The\nIRAS survey detected about 250.000 sources. including new comets and dust bands in\nthe solar system; unsuspected material around main sequence stars; complex clouds of\ninterstellar dust; and very red. extremely luminous extragalactic sources. Technically. IRAS was also a critically important precursor to SIRTF. IRAS was the first\nlarge super-fluid helium dewar in Earth orbit. It demonstrated containment of\nsuperfluid helium in zero g and also addressed such questions as the effects of\nhelium sloshing on pOinting. the degradation of optical surfaces and solid state\ndetectors over long periods of orbital operation. and the susceptibility of a cryogenic telescope to contamination by the residual atmosphere. dust particles. or\nother processes. All of these areas were major concerns prior to IRAS. and all were\nfound to be insignificant during the mission.\nThe success of IRAS has already had a significant impact on SIRTF. Astronomers have long realized that a cryogenically cooled telescope in Earth orbit would\nbe an extremely powe!ful scientific tool. and a series of peer review reports. most\nrecently the 1982 Astronomy Survey Committee report of the National Academy of\nSciences. have recommended continued active development of SIRTF. The initial SIRTF\nconcept utilized the Space Shuttle as an initial observing platform with frequent\nreflights. possible inst~ument changes. and eventual conversion to a long-duration\nfree flyer. The scientific and technical success of IRAS. together with the recent\nrapid evolution in detector technology and new information on the projected frequency and duration of Shuttle flights. have now made it overwhelmingly evident that\nthe Shuttle-attached phase is neither desirable nor necessary. As a result. a\n\n3\n\ndecision to proceed directly with the long-duration SIRTF was made by NASA in\nMay 1984.\nIn the following sections, we will discuss the scientific implications of this\nlong-duration SIRTF. The specific concepts presented are based on the Phase A SIRTF\nstudy recently completed by the Ames Research Center. This will very probably not\nbe the final form of SIRTF, since it has not been subject to final review by the\nSIRTF Science Working Group or to a detailed design study, but the broad outline\nshould be representative.\n\nTHE CAPABILITIES OF SIRTF\n\nFigure 2 shows a cutaway view of SIRTF without its spacecraft. The Cassegrain\noptical system surrounded by a superfluid helium dewar is very similar to the layout\nof IRAS, as is the truncated sunshade. The scientific instruments are located\nradially around the optical axis, and the infrared beam can be directed into the\n\nSIRTF TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY\n\nVACUUM VALVE\n\nSECONDARY MIRROR\n\nMULTIPLE INSTRUMENT\nCHAMBER\n\nFigure 2.- A cutaway view of the long-life SIRTF telescope concept.\n\n4\n\nchosen instrument by a rotating dichroic.\nfine guidance sensor within the dewar.\n\nThe optical radiation passes through to a\n\nIn table 1, the current performance requirements for SIRTF are compared with\nthe actually achieved performance of IRAS. The table shows that in some areas the\ndifference between SIRTF and IRAS is quantitative rather than qualitative. For\ninstance, the collecting area is about three times larger, the optical quality is\nsubstantially improved, and the cryogen lifetime is about three times longer. The\nfundamental qualitative differences between SIRTF and IRAS are in two areas:\n(1) IRAS was a survey instrument with source dwell times typically <1 sec, whereas\nSIRTF is a pointed observatory, capable of studying individual sources for\nintegration times up to =15 min per orbit; (2) IRAS\'s focal plane was designed to\ncarry out an efficient all-sky survey, so the instrument had four broad spectral\nbands between 8 and 120 ~m with fields of view large compared to the diffraction\nlimit, together with a spectrometer providing low-resolution 7.3- to 23-~ spectra\nof the brighter sources. By contrast, SIRTF\'s large instrument chamber will\n\nTABLE 1.- BASELINE SPECIFICATIONS FOR SIRTF\nWITH IRAS PERFORMANCE FOR COMPARISON\nParameter\n\nSIRTF\n\nIRAS\n\nPrimary mirror diameter, m\nEffective collecting area, m2\nWavelength coverage, ~m\nDiffraction-limited\nperformance, pm\nImage diameter, arcsec\nPointing stability, arcsec rms\nField of view, arc min\nModulation\n\n0.90\n0.58\n1.8 to 700\n2\n\n0.60\n0.22\n8 to 120\n-15\n\n0.6\n0.1\n>7\nSecondary mirror\narticulation\nSuperfluid helium\n1.8\n<5\n\n-6\n\nCryogen\nCryogen temperature, K\nOptics temperature, K\n\n2\n\n60\nTelescope scanning\nSuperfluid helium\n1.8\n<5\n\nBroadband sensitivity*\n10 pm\n\n100 pm\nAngular resolution at\n60 pm, arcsec\n*SIRTF sensitivity:\nIRAS sensitivity:\n\n0.006 mJy\n\n0.1 mJy\n18 (Diffractionlimi ted)\no in 15 min\no survey scan\n\n5\n\n70 mJy\n\n300 mJy\n90 (Detector-widthlimi ted)\n\naccommodate a number of focal plane instruments with wide-ranging capability. The\ninstrument complement selected for definition for SIRTF (table 2) will provide at\nleast the ability to measure spectra with resolving power between 50 and 1000 over\nthe 2.5- to 200-~m region, to form images in either broad or narrow spectral bands\nat the diffraction limit of the telescope over the 1.8- to 200-~ region, and to\nmake precise and sensitive flux measurements over the entire 1.8- to 700-~ region\nwithin which SIRTF will operate. The IRAS focal plane contained 76 discrete detectors, while SIRTF\'s instrumentation will include many thousands of detector elements, including both arrays and discrete detectors. Improvements in detector\nmaterials, fabrication techniques, and preamps since the definition of the IRAS\nfocal plane will permit the SIRTF detectors, both discrete and arrays, to operate at\nthe sensitivity levels set by the astrophysical background.\nThe instrumental capabilities of SIRTF are summarized and compared with\nthose of IRAS in figure 3.

The SIRTF sensitivity is shown in the top panel for both\nbroadband (~~/~ = 0.5; background-limited) and high resolution (~~/~ = 0.001;\nbased on proposed instrumental parameters) modes. An integration time of\n15 minutes is assumed for SIRTF. The initial instrument complement currently\nunder definition for SIRTF does not include spectroscopic capability longward\nof 200 lIm.\n7\n\nthat scientifically SIRTF is an enormous step forward--not only a step beyond IRAS,\nbut beyond all our current capabilities. It combines the great power of a cryogenically cooled telescope outside the Earth\'s atmosphere with the spectral and\nimaging capability of state-of-the-art infrared instrumentation.\n\nTHE PROSPECTS FOR SIRTF SCIENCE\n\nThe scientific scope of SIRTF\'s capabilities may be summarized as follows:\n\nPhotometry\nNatural-background-limited, by either photon or confusion noise, from\n<5 ~ to close to 700 ~m. SIRTF would thus be >1000 times more sensitive than\neither IRAS or any other current or near-term facilities. It is difficult to get a\nfeeling for the significance of such a gain in sensitivity. As one example, SIRTF\nwould be able to measure the energy distributions of all quasi-stellar objects\n(QSOs) brighter than 23rd visual magnitude if they have energy distributions like\nthat of 3C273. Fainter QSOs appear to be redder, so in fact SIRTF would be even\nmore powerful than this. By contrast, even after IRAS only a handful of quasars\nhave been measured at 10 ~m and beyond. A second way to look at the SIRTF\nsensitivity is that SIRTF will be able to observe stars with a 100-~m magnitude of\nabout +9. Prior to IRAS, the only stellar photosphere detected beyond 20 ~ was\nthat of the sun. SIRTF will be able to study both the chromosphere-photosphere\ntransition region in normal stars to beyond the limit of the Bright Star Catalog,\nand the circumstellar environment of extremely large numbers of abnormal stars\nexhibiting accretion and mass-loss processes.\n\nImagery\nSIRTF will be capable of diffraction-limited imagery using arrays of substantial size in the 1.8 to 30-~ range, and smaller arrays for longer wavelengths, with\nsensitivity similar to that for photometry. The diffraction limit of an 0.85-m\nSIRTF is about 3 arcsec at 10 ~m and 30 arcsec at 100 ~m. This capability will be\ncrucial for deep surveys, and for the study of extended objects, such as star formation regions in our galaxy, nearby galaxies, globular clusters, etc. Under some\nconditions, signal-to-noise ratio can be traded off for spatial information beyond\nthe nominal diffraction limits, so that it should be possible to measure separations\nor sizes of bright (by SIRTF standards) sources down to 1 arcsec at 10 ~m.\n\n8\n\nSpectroscopy\nThe infrared region contains many spectral features that make it extremely\nvaluable for investigating a wide variety of environments and types of celestial\nobjects. These include diffuse features associated with interstellar grains, such\nas those due to silicates at 9.6 and 20 ~ and to H20 ice at 3.1 ~m. These features\ncan be very strong even at low spectral resolution and thus should be an excellent\nmethod for measuring the redshifts of very red distant galaxies. The 1.8to 500-~ region also contains all of the fundamental molecular vibrational transitions, as well as the fundamental rotational transitions in light molecules such as\nH2 , HD, and H20. The study of rotational transitions of heavier molecules in the\nmicrowave region has been vital to our understanding of the chemistry and dynamics\nin molecular clouds, but the infrared features will be particularly well suited for\nprobing the higher temperature, higher eXCitation, more violent world associated\nwith a star-forming region. The H2 rotational transitions are very important, since\nmost of the mass of molecular clouds is in this form, while the H20 transitions are\nexpected to dominate the cooling of the gas in a variety of environments. Finally,\nthe many fine-structure forbidden transitions of heavy elements, both atoms and\nions, which lie in the infrared are often strongly excited in HII regions and in the\ninterstellar medium. The range of ionization states accessible to infrared\nobservations, and the insensitivity of the line flux to electron temperature, will\nmake SIRTF a powerful tool for the study of heavy-element abundances and abundance\ngradients in our galaxy and in external galaxies. The 01 and ell fine structure\nlines at 63 and 158 ~ are produced very efficiently in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium and may be strong enough to be observed in gas-rich galaxies as distant as\nz ~ 0.3. SIRTF will also be capable of observing the faintest IRAS sources at a\nresolving power, R, of 1000 and most known QSOs at R > 100 throughout the 5to 1OO-~m range.\nGiven these general capabilities, we can highlight the following four areas of\nscientific interest as ones which SIRTF will address particularly effectively:\n\nIRAS Followup\nBy the time SIRTF is launched, there will have been an 8- to 10-year assessment\nof the IRAS catalog using our whole arsenal of observing and analysis techniques.\nThis will yield three classes of results:\n1. Improved understanding of the nature of the IRAS sources and of the\nphysical processes occurring in them.\n2. A long list of well-defined issues which require specific infrared observations for their resolution. For many of the fainter IRAS sources, SIRTF will be the\nonly facility capable of these observations.\n3. Sources which remain unclassified. These may include the most interesting\nfindings of IRAS. Examples might be found among the cool discrete sources of high\ngalactic latitude seen only at 60 and 100 ~m. Many of these have been identified\n9\n\nwith galaxies, some with infrared-to-optical luminosity ratios of 250 or more (for\nour galaxy the ratio is about one) and redshifts as high as z = 0.2. The total\nluminosity of these galaxies can exceed 10 12L\xc2\xae, comparable to the luminosity of\nQSOs. The fainter IRAS objects of this type may be among the most distant and\nluminous galaxies identified. SIRTF will be the only facility capable of detailed\nspectral study of these sources in the infrared, which will be required for their\nidentification, for an understanding of their enormous luminosities, and even, in\nextreme cases, for distance determinations based on redshifted infrared spectral\nfeatures.\nDeep Survey\nA second area of study would be a very deep survey, covering a few square\ndegrees of sky at each of several wavelengths, which would require several hundred\nhours to complete. Such a survey would reach a flux level about 5000 times fainter\nthan IRAS, and sample a volume roughly 30 times that sampled by the entire IRAS allsky survey for objects of fixed luminosity. In addition, such a survey would cross\ncritical sensitivity thresholds for the detection of astrophysically significant\nobjects, both nearby and very distant. Examples include:\n1. Brown dwarfs, sub-stellar objects which glow dimly through the release of\ngravitational energy. The SIRTF survey could identify up to 50 such objects, and\ntheir characteristics and space densities would test theories of their structure and\nformation and evaluate their contribution to the local missing mass.\n2. An unbiased infrared sample of quasi-stellar objects. This set would allow\na test of the reality of the cutoff in the density of QSOs at z = 3 to 4 and the\npossible role of extinction due to dust in producing this cutoff.\n3. Primeval galaxies. If star formation occurs during the initial collapse of\na primordial galaxy producing a luminosity = 10 12L\xc2\xae, the SIRTF deep survey should\ndetect large numbers of such primeval galaxies if the time of formation corresponds\nto a redshift z < 15.\n\nStatistically Significant Samples\nOne of SIRTF\'s great advantages is its ability to carry out detailed spectroscopic and imaging studies of sufficient numbers of objects that the effects of\nindividual idiosyncrasies can be averaged out, revealing the underlying physical\nprocesses. Samples of types of problems in this area are:\n1. The origin of the difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet QSOs, which\nshow similar energy distributions out to 100 ~, but differ dramatically at 1 mm.\nThe origin of the wide range of infrared luminosities of active galactic\nnuclei. At least two processes are thought to be involved in these nuclei, a\n"starburst" process in which the infrared luminosity is due to a large number of\nyoung, massive stars in the central 100- to 1000-pc of the galaxy, and a "nuclear\n2.\n\n10\n\nengine"--such as an accreting black hole--at least partially obscured by dust.\nCoordinated spectroscopic, photometric, and imaging observation of many objects over\na wide range of wavelengths are required to understand the variety of processes and\ntheir interactions.\n\n3. Star formation. Star formation is a very complex and intriguing process,\nand the IRAS results on star formation regions show complex structure on all spatial\nscales and a wide range of temperatures. SIRTF will be able very efficiently to\nobtain information critical to our understanding of the processes occurring in these\nregions. Examples include a detailed census of nearby star formation regions,\nleading to a determination of protostellar luminosity functions extending to low\nluminosity in a number of regions with varying properties. Recent work has shown\nthat mass-loss phenomena--often manifested through energetic shocks--are of\nimportance in the latter stages of star formation. These phenomena can be studied\nin a wide variety of environments in our own galaxy and in nearby galaxies.\nSolar System Studies\nCloser to home, SIRTF will be able to study the properties of a variety of\nsolar system bodies--the surface composition of asteroids and planetary satellites\nin the outer solar system; studies of ccmets far from the Sun, including the\ndevelopment and composition of cometary comae; and the composition of the zodiacal\ndust cloud and the dust bands found by IRAS inclined to the ecliptic plane. The\nIRAS discovery of large, cool dust shells around Vega and Formalhaut opens up a new\napproach for solar system studies. The possibility that this material may represent\na remnant of a phase of planetary system formation makes the study of the clouds\nfound by IRAS and the search for further such objects very important and very exciting. Using SIRTF, much fainter shells can be detected, and detailed spectra can be\nobtained for composition and temperature studies and for searches for fluorescence\nphenomena associated with volatile molecules. High-spatial-resolution observations\nmay be capable of addressing the question of the distribution of the material by\ndistinguishing between rings, disks, and shells. SIRTF will help us to understand\nthe evolutionary state of these clouds, the frequency of their occurrence, and the\nrelation of this phenomenon to planetary formation.\n\nSIRTF in Context\nMost astrophysical problems require study over a broad range of wavelengths.\nFigure 4 shows how the SIRTF performance compares with that of other advanced facilities for space astronomy which will be operating in the 1990s and which are also\ncomponents of the Golden Age of Astronomy. Like these other facilities, SIRTF will\nbe a true observatory available to the entire scientific community. One can see how\nSIRTF nicely fills in most of the gap between the Space Telescope and the Very Large\nArray. Studies of energetic sources like QSOs, galactic jets, and BL Lac objects\nover extremely wide ranges of photon energy can be carried out with this combination\nof facilities. Coordinated observations have been and will be very important in\nunderstanding the nature and processes active in such sources. SIRTF will make it\n\n11\n\n102\n\nen\n\n>\n~\n\nw\n\n...........\n\nIRAS\n\nQUASAR\n.01\n\nen\'\nen\n\nz\n\n............\n\nVERY DISTANT\n\nen\n\nZ\n<!\n-,\n\nQUASAR 3C273\n\n............\n\n\\\n\nV L A r .......\n10-4\n\nIJ:\n(!]\n\na:: 10-6\nIII\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n,,\n,\n\nW\n\n"-\n\nU\n\na::\n\n:> 10-8\n0\n\nen\n\n\\\n\n10- 10\n\n10- 12\n\nGAMMA\nRAY\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM\n\nFigure 4.- The capabilities of SIRTF are compared with those of the other advanced\nfacilities to be operating in the 1990s, and with the energy distribution of a\ndistant quasar.\npossible to include measurements over more than two decades in the infrared and thus\nassures us the capability to make measurements of faint objects across the entire\nelectromagnetic spectrum.\n\nTELESCOPE TECHNOLOGY\nWe have reviewed briefly the kinds of scientific investigations that SIRTF\ncould undertake. It is clear that SIRTF can address many of the most interesting\nand important problems of astroPhysics today. Now we will review the technical\nand then the programmatic status of SIRTF. The first of the Phase A studies for\nSIRTF started in 1974. These studies have been carried out by representatives of\nuniversities, industry, and NASA centers under the direction of the Ames Research\nCenter (ARC) and with the help of several scientific advisory groups. Recently ARC\nfinished the Phase A system concept description for a long-duration SIRTF. Since\n1974 the total funding associated with these studies has amounted to about $15M.\nThe studies have been directed toward developing a concept for the SIRTF facility\nand addressing areas of technological weakness. They have been largely completed,\nwith work continuing in just a few areas. In addition, as mentioned previously, the\ntechnical success of IRAS has proven many of the technologies critical to SIRTF.\n\n12\n\nThe important technical features of the current SIRTF concept include:\n\nCryogenics\nThe intent here is to build on the IRAS experience and other forthcoming experience with superfluid helium in space: the infrared telescope and superfluid helium\nexperiment to be carried by the Shuttle in the Spacelab 2 flight in March 1985, and\nthe Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) dewar, currently under construction, which is\nsomewhat larger than the IRAS dewar. SIRTF will take advantage of the Shuttle lift\ncapacity and utilize a much larger dewar, perhaps eight times the size of the IRAS\ndewar. Because the instrument power dissipation and aperture loading are higher for\nSIRTF than for IRAS, it is expected that the larger cryogen capacity will result in\nabout a lifetime three times longer for SIRTF--in excess of 2 years. Studies are\nnow under way to look into the possibility of cryogen transfer in space so that the\nlifetime of SIRTF can be extended by several times, perhaps to a decade.\n\nOptics\nThe IRAS optical system was made from beryllium and achieved diffractionlimited performance at around 15 pm. Because of the more stringent requirements\nfor SIRTF, other materials have been investigated, and tests have been performed on\na 50-cm-diameter fused quartz mirror. Cooling this mirror to 10 K introduced only\nmarginally detectable distortion - consistent with diffraction-limited performance\nat 2 pm. The figure was maintained in cold tests carried out with the mirror\nmounted in a prototype mirror mount which provided mechanical rigidity while\ncompensating for the differential contraction between the mirror and its support\nstructure. Further cryogenic tests of mirrors and mirror mounts, including mirrors\nfabricated from a new ultrahomogeneous form of beryllium, are ongoing.\n\nPointing and Guiding\nCoarse pointing and guiding will be accomplished using reaction wheels or\ncontrol moment gyros in the spacecraft, with fine guidance accomplished via an\noptical charge-coupled device (CCO) in the telescope focal plane and an articulated\nsecondary mirror to correct the pointing. Small telescope tests of CCO systems have\nbeen done, and warm tests of a sample articulated secondary mirror have been carried\nout, with further tests, including cold tests, planned.\nOutside of these areas and the instruments, which will be discussed next, SIRTF\nhas much in common with other NASA space facilities such as AXAF and GRO. SIRTF is\nbetween GRO and AXAF in weight, power requirements, and spacecraft pointing requirements. They have similar command and data storage requirements, and the SIRTF\ncommunication needs are within the standard capabilities of the Tracking Data and\nRelay Satellite System (TORSS). Because SIRTF is very sensitive to residual atmospheric effects and requires orbital altitudes greater than 600 km, it would use the\nNASA Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle for insertion into final orbit and for retrieval\n13\n\nfor cryogen replenishment. Both IRAS-type--polar, sun-synchronous, twilight terminator--and low-inclination orbits appear to be technically feasible for SIRTF; this\ntrade will be the subject of further study during the coming months.\n\nINSTRUMENT TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe initial instrument complement selected for definition studies for SIRTF\nis shown in table 2; the definition studies will be carried out over the next\n2 years. There are a few general comments that can be made in terms of technological readiness, however. First, substantial experience already exists with cold\ninfrared instruments for use with ground-based facilities, with the Kuiper Airborne\nObservatory, and with COBE, to name a few examples. Second, the crucial technologies and the critical advances of SIRTF over IRAS are in the areas of arrays and\ndetectors. There have been major developments in this area in the last few years\nsince the IRAS detector selection, including improvements in the materials and\ncontacting techniques for photoconductive detectors and in preamplifier technology.\nThe noise equivalent power (NEP) (the power detected in 1 sec with unit signal\nto noise) of the IRAS detectors, which used transimpedance amplifiers, was about\n10-16w/ /HZ. Recent work has been in the area of integrating preamps, where the\neffective NEP can be improved as a result of quieter components and longer integration times. This is essentially the same technique used in optical CCDs. For discrete detector preamps, read noises of about 10-20 electrons have been reported.\nWith an integration time of 1 sec, this corresponds to an NEP of about 10-18w/ /HZ_roughly 100 times better than the IRAS detectors.\nThe infrared arrays available now are hybrid in character, with a detector\nsection bonded to a multiplexing section. These arrays also use an integrating\nreadout technique, with the integration occurring in the detector itself, as in a\ncharge injection device (CID) or photodiode device, or in the multiplexer section.\nRecent measurements on what are called direct readout arrays have shown readout\nnoise levels of about 100 electrons. Figure 5 shows what this means for SIRTF. It\nshows the NEP vs. wavelength for natural background limited performance for a diffraction limited field of view and a relatively narrow filter. Also shown is the\nNEP of an integrating detector with l-sec integration time and lOa-electron read\nnoise. Because the NEP in this situation varies as t- 0 \xe2\x80\xa2 5 , integration times of\n10 to 100 sec are sufficient for background-limited performance with this read\nnoise. This is again a major improvement compared to the IRAS detectors.\nSelf-scanned infrared arrays are also very useful on ground-based telescopes.\nIn general, operation of these devices on a warm telescope is much more difficult\nthan it will be on SIRTF. Because of the very high background of a warm telescope,\nvery fast readouts are required, about l-msec cycle time for the whole array at\n10 ~, and the signal is extremely small compared to the background, perhaps one\npart in 10 5 or so. These considerations make the early results obtained with selfscanned arrays on ground-based telescopes all the more impressive.

Abstract\nThis paper describes the scientific and technical background and prospects for the Space\nInfrared Telescope Facility, SIRTF. SIRTF is a superfluid-helium-cooled, 0.85-meter infrared\ntelescope to be placed in orbit in 1993. It will carry out photometry over the wavelength\nrange 2 to 700 ).lm, and diffractiori-limited imagery in either broad or narrow spectral bands over\nthe range 1.8 to 200 ).lm, down to flux levels of 10- 6 janskys at 2 ).lm, about 10- 4 janskys in the\nrange 15 to 200 ).lm and 10- 2 janskys at 700 ).lm. These fluxes are up to 10 4 times fainter than\ncurrently achievable levels. SIRTF will measure spectra in the range 2.5 to 200 ).lm with resolving\npower between 50 and 1000. The focal plane will contain about 20,000 detector elements, both\ndiscrete and in arrays, which will operate at sensitivity levels set by the astrophysical background. SIRTF will be a long-lived (~ 10 yr) facility providing opportunities for general\ninvestigations by the entire scientific community.\nSIRTF will be ideal for following up the all-sky survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). SIRTF can do a deep survey to flux levels 5000 times fainter than IRAS and\ncan obtain spectra of even the faintest IRAS sources. SIRTF will provide powerful capabilities\nfor the study of astrophysical problems ranging from the formation of planetary systems and the\nnature of the Sun\'s nearest neighbors to the formation of galaxies in the early universe.\n\n17.
