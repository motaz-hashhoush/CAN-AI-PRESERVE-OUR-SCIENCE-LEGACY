b'Maximizing the Results of Federally-funded\nResearch and Development through Knowledge\nManagement: A Strategic Imperative for Improving\nU.S. Competitiveness\n\nThomas E. Pinelli*\nRebecca 0. Barclay\n\nFederally-funcled research and development (R&D) represents a significant annual\ninvestment (approximately $79 billion in fiscal year 1996)on the part of 1J.S. taxpayers.\nBased on the results of a 10-year stitdy of knowledge clil\'l\'usion in the U.S. aerospace\nindustry, the authors take the position that U.S. competitiveness will be enhanced il\'\nknowledge management strategies. employed within a capability-enhancing U.S.\ntechnology policy framework, are applied to diffusing the results ol\' federally-funded\nR&D. In making their case, the authors stress the importance of knowledge as the\nsource of competitive advantage in today\'s global economy. Next, they offer a practicebased definition ol\' knowledge management and discuss three current approaches to\n"the learning organization,"\nknowledge management imple~nentation-~~iechnnistic.\npolicy\nand systemic. The authors then examine three weaknesses in existing U.S. pi~blic\nand policy implementation-the dominance of knowledge creation, the need Sor\ndiffusion-oriented technology policy, and the prevalence of a dissemination modelthat affect diffusion of the results of federally-fi~nded R&D. To address these\nshortcomings, they propose the development of a knowledge management framework\nfor diffusing the resillts of federally-funded R&D.

Information and knowledge\nhave replaced financial capital as the main producers of wealth. A new "information\ncapitalism" now dominates the world economy; industries that have moved into the center\nof the economy in the last 40 years have as their business the production and distribution\nof knowledge and information.\' Knowledge qua capital represents a new and vital factor\nthat must be added to the three factors of production-land, labor, and financial capitaltraditionally studied by econorni~ts.~\nHowever, knowledge qua capital, or production asset,\ndefies easy definition; therefore, existing economic theories cannot be applied to explain\nits behavior.\' ~ c h m o o k l epoints out that knowledge may be valued for its own sake, as a\nr~\n"public good," or for its application, through which it becomes a "private" or "capitol\ngood." Theorists posit a positive relationship between knowledge accumulation/utilization\nand economic growth.\' To develop a theory of the econoniics of knowledge, ~omer,(\'\n~ c h w a r t z ,~ c o t t , ~ others have begun to investigate the economic behavior of\n~\nand\nknowledge and its role in innovation.\nThe international business community has come to view knowledge, particularly\nspecialized knowledge, as an essential ingredient for competitive s u c c e ~ sManagement\n.~\ntlieorists expect improvements in knowledge-based work to contribute significantly to\nindustrial growth and gains in productivity in the United States and abroad. Furthermore,\nthey anticipate that "[mlore of an organization\'s core competencies will center around\nmanaging knowledge and knowledge worker^."\'^ Thus, effectively managing the creation,\ntransfer. and use of knowledge resources is beconling a critical factor for the survival and\nsuccess of organizations and societies alike." Finns in such diverse industries as\nchemicals. pharmaceuticals. financial services, and telecommunications already consider\nthe strategic management of knowledge-the "intellectual assets" of an organization12-a\nkey corporate activity and have implemented knowledge management programs. These\nprogsams emphasize the critical nature of knowledge as a competitive asset and seek to\nmaximize the ability of an organization to integrate and use various kinds of knowledge,\nMany fini~s\nhave appointed individuals at tlie executive level to manage and direct the\nutilization of the organization\'s intellectual assets. These individuals are known by a\nvariety of titles-chief knowledge officer (CKO), chief learning officer (CLO), director of\nintellectual capital, and other labels that describe the scope and direction of an\norganization\'s knowledge management initiatives. 13\nThe federal government is perhaps the single largest investor in knowledge production\nin tlie United States, having spent approximately $79 billion on research and development\n(R&D) in fiscal year 1996. With knowledge considered the single most important\ncontributor to technological innovation, economic growth, and international\ncompetitiveness, is the United States reaping the benefits of its significant annual\ninvestment in knowledge creation? The results of our 10-year investigation of the diffusion\nof federally-funded knowledge to the U.S. aerospace industry suggest not.14 We believe\nthat the return on investment in knowledge production can be improved if U.S.\npolicymakers recognize the value of knowledge as a competitive resource in today\'s global\neconomy, and replace or modify existing mission-oriented technology policy with a\ndiffusion-oriented, capability-enhancing technology policy, and if the federal government\nadopts a system and methods for effectively and strategically managing knowledge.\n\n.\n\nKNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT-AN\n\nOPERATIONAL DEFINITION\n\nRecognition of the importance of knowledge as an asset and a source of competitive\nadvantage is driving organizations to find ways of optimizing and managing this resource.\nUnder the general rubric of "knowledge management," organizations in the private and\npublic sectors have begun exploring methods for creating and deriving value from existing\nexplicit and tacit organizational knowledge resources. Although there is no single, agreedupon approach to the practice, knowledge management, in general, encompasses a variety\nof strategies, methods, and technologies for leveraging the intellectual capital and knowhow of organizations for competitive advantage. In brief, the practices associated with\nknowledge management include identifying and mapping both the tacit (unarticulated and\ninformal) and explicit (articulated and formal) knowledge of organizations; importing\npotentially usefill knowledge from the external environment; making relevant knowledge\navailable to users in forms that best meet their knowledge requirements; winnowing ant1\nfiltering out unnecessary or irrelevant information; creating new knowledge that can\nprovide competitive advantage; sharing the best methods and practices for completing\nknowledge-based work; and applying strategies, techniques, and tools that support the\nforegoing activities.15\nThree approaches to knowledge management-a\nmechanistic focus, "the learning\norganization," and a systemic focus-currently\ndominate. The first, a mechanistic\napproach, relies almost exclusively on information technology for managing explicit\nknowledge. Tools like computerized knowledge bases and internal and external\n(technology-based) networks that enable the use of e-mail and groupware applications\nfigure prominently in improving access to knowledge within an organization. Closely\nrelated to a dissenlination model, this approach assumes that increased availability and\naccess will improve the use of organizational knowledge resources. This approach largely\nignores tacit knowledge. A second approach, which has roots in process reengineering and\nchange management, deals with managing knowledge from the perspective of altering\norganizational culture and behavior. The "learning organization" approach, derived fronl\nthe systems-theory work of senge,16 attempts to change rigidified and frequently\ndysfunctional behaviors and cultures that may result in knowledge hoarding. A "peopleoriented" approach, it stresses collaboration and the sharing of knowledge through what\n~ a d a r a c c o \'terms developing "knowledge links." A learning organization encourages\n~\ncreative approaches to problem-solving; computer and information technology play only a\nsecondary role in managing existing explicit knowledge. A rlzird, systemic approach draws\non theories and practices from a variety of disciplines (e.g., library and information\nscience, organization science, and computer-supported collaborative work) and\ntechnologies (e.g., decision support systems, relational and object databases, and semantic\nnetworks) to examine the nature of knowledge-based work and model, elucidate, and\nmanage both explicit and tacit knowledge resources. This approach acknowledges the\nimportance of cultural and behavioral factors while seeking to maximize the value of\ninternal (explicit and tacit) knowledge resources through the application of computer and\ninformation .technology. The systemic approach also has a "competitive intelligence"\nelement in that it recognizes the value of and seeks out the\'best sources of external\nknowledge. 18\n\n1O( t\n\n(\n\n;OVEI<NMENT\nINFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 15INo. 2 1 998\n1\n\nBccai~se practices associated with managing knowledge have their roots in a variety\nthe\nof disciplines, an all-encompassing theory of knowledge management has yet to emerge.\nRegardless of the approach taken, the goal of knowledge management is to leverage\nknowledge to maximize competitive advantage. The objectives of knowledge management\ncall for making a direct connection between the i~itellectual\nassets of an organization, both\ntacit and explicit, and positive busirless results." The objectives include (I) creating a\nknowledge base by identifying and captill-ing internal knowledge assets, importing external\nknowledge, and fostering the creation of new knowledge; (2) compiling and transforming\nexisting knowledge for application and re-use through methods that reconstruct, validate,\nand i~ivcntory\nboth tacit and explicit forms of knowledgc; (3) diffusing knowledge among\nindividuals and teams who can put it to use; and (4) applying knowledge that has been\nhe\ndiffused to add value to products arid s e r ~ i c e s . ~ \' ~wise use of computer and information\ntechnology coupled with an organizational culture that supports and rewards knowledgecreating and knowledge-sharing activities is fundamental for meeting these objectives.\n\nKNOWLEDGE, U.S. SCIENCE AND\nTECHNOLOGY POLICY, AND COMPETITIVENESS\nThe U.S. government has played an important role in determining tlie direction and rate of\ntechnological innovatioil." Although the policy focus and emphasis have shifted over the\npast 50 years, the assumptions underlying the model that dominates U.S. science (and\ntcclinology) policy have riot changed. The model derives from Vanrievar Bush\'s Sciertcs,\n{Itc Bidlr,s.s ~ r n n t i e r . which was iliterpreted to mean that the suppoi-t of basic scientific\n,~~\nrcscarch would yield new technological ideas that would simply move from R&D to\ncommercial products. In effect, this niodel takes a "pipeline" view of the innovation\nprocess.23 Critics find several flaws in this model: ( 1 ) it takes an unrealistic view of the\nprocess of technological innovation; (2) it favors science and the creation of (new)\nknowlcdge over technology arid the use of existing knowledge; and (3) it ignores the\nimportance and the proccss of diffusing knowlcdge.\nIn tlie immediate post-World War I1 period. science and technology became strategic\ncomponents of national security and foreign policies. During the Cold War era, U.S.\nnational security and foreign policies focused on rebuilding the economies of allies and\nformer- enemies alike in an effort to establish successful free market democracies and\ncounter the threat of Soviet expansion. As an element of these policies, the United States\nroutinely encouraged tlie transfer of knowledge and technology to "friendly" nations\nengaged in economic reconstruction. Because defense needs dominated science and\ntechnology-related policies, little attention was given to the transfer and use of knowledge\nand technology for civilian commercial purposes.\nAs U.S. firms began to seek investment opportunities abroad, many foreign\ngovcrntnents, as part of their domestic economic policies, made the transfer of highly\nregarded U.S. technology a condition of foreign investment. In many instances, U.S.\nnational security and foreign policies actively encouraged and promoted such transfers,\npa~*ticularly nations that served as a buffer against communist expansion. In the short\nto\nterm, these policies proved successful in helping to rebuild the economies of post-war\nEurope and Japan and ultimately in winning the Cold War. However, with the collapse of\n\nMaximizing Federally-lunded R&V\n\nI01\n\nthe fornler Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the United States found itself\nengaged in a different kind of conflict-a global econon~ic that is, at least in large part,\none\nan unintended consequence of the success of Cold War era security and foreign policies. In\nhelping to rebuild the economic and technological infrastructures of allies and former\nenemies through the deliberate transfer of knowledge and technology, the United States\nhas enabled these nations to become economic competitors on an equal footing with the\nUnited States in several i n d u ~ t r i e s . ~ ~\n\nThe International Competitive Landscape\nThe economic strength of the United States relative to the rest of the world has changed\ndran~atically the past 45 years. In 1950, the United States contributed nearly 40% of the\nin\ndeveloped world\'s gross domestic product (GDP); by 1994, the United States contribution\nhad fallen to just over 24% of the world\'s GDP.~\' With respect to R&D, the shift is even\ngreater. In 1950, the United States conducted more than twice as ~nuch\nR&D as the rest of\nthe world; by 1994, the rest of the world was conducting alnlost twice as much R&D as the\nUnited ~ t a t e s . \' ~ the 25 years immediately following World War 11, most of the\nIn\nsignificant technological developments occurred in U.S research establishments and\nlaboratories. Since 1970, the balance has shifted considerably, with the result that\nknowledge and technology created outside the United States are increasingly important to\nthe growth and con~petitiveness of U.S. industry. Other nations have tieveloped\nsophisticated technical infrastructures, alliances, and partnerships that enable them to use\nthe results of domestic and foreign R&D. A number of foreign nations now have the\ncapability for rapid commercialization of new and emerging knowledge and technology\nand "prosper in an environment of shorter product, process, and service life cycles."27 U.S.\ntechnological superiority during the immediate post-World War I1 era was graci~ui~lly\nreplaced during the 1970s and 1980s by a dominant triad composed of the United States,\nEurope, and Japan. The triad is now giving way to a global economy that includes a range\nof rapidly industrializing nations that offer potentially powerful economic competition as\nwell as markets for U.S.-developed products and services. Many econo~nic\nrivals consider\nknowledge and technology the weapons of choice in a global economic war.28\nOther nations, particularly those of Western Europe and Japan, now enjoy tecl~nological\nparity with the United States and have become highly conlpetitive rivals. Given the\ndevelopment of such competition, the emergence of a global economy, and the impost~ulce\nof knowledge and technology as key economic drivers, the United States needs to\nreevaluate its science and tech~lologypolicies as they affect innovation and econonlic\ncompetitiveness. Since 1945, U.S. science and technology policies have focused o n basic\nresearch as the primary vehicle for stimulating innovation,\'%ith\nscience policy\nemphasizing university-conducted research performed without thought of practical ends,\nand technology policy focusing on Department of Defense "mission-oriented," dual-use,\nspin-off applications. These policies reflect the dominant political-social view that ( 1 ) the\nroute to successfi~l\ninnovation is through basic research, (2) the knowledge necessary ti)r\nsuccessful innovation comes from basic research, (3) technology is little more than applied\nscience, and (4) apart from basic research, the remaining components of product and\nprocess innovation (e.g., design, development, and production) are not the purview of\ngovernment and, therefore, should be left to the private sector. Increasingly, the iniportance\n\n162\n\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY\n\nVol. 15INo. 2 1998\n1\n\nof the linkage between the knowledge generated by basic research and commercial\ninnovation has come under challenge. In fact, critics have begun to question the existence\nof a linkage. Study results indicate that economically successful innovation is frequently\nthe product of incremental improvements in existing t e c h n o l ~ g i e sand that many\n~~\nbreakthrough innovations stem from invention or trial and error learning, rather than basic\nre~earch.~\'\nCritics generally agree that the linear research model, which assumes that basic\nresearch automatically leads to product development, is essentially a myth.32 AS ~ e a l e ~ ~ ~\npoints out, "some 90 percent of new technology arises from the industrial development of\npre-existing technology-not\nfrom academic science." Although we do not advocate\nignoring the value of basic research (particularly in such fields as biomedicine and\npharmaceuticals), the focus of current U.S. science and technology policies seems\nmisdirected and simply inappropriate for a nation struggling to maintain its ability to\ncompete in the global economy.\n\nThe Dominance of Knowledge Creation\nFrom the end of World War Il-when the United States emerged as the world\'s\nundisputed leader in science and technology-until the early 1980s, U.S. public policy\nfocused on creating knowledge as a source of military advantage and a hedge against\nuncertainty." Conventional wisdom held that the United States would continue to lead the\nworld in major discoveries. inventions, and innovations. The prevailing philosophy\nunderlying the "product-cycle theory" was that technological innovation in the United\nStates would always remain a step ahead of would-be i ~ n i t a t o r sHowever, the process of\n.~~\ninnovation is complicated, and thc generation of knowledge represents only 5-1096 of the\neffort required to introduce a new product.36 Furthermore, technological innovation has\nless to do with generating new knowledge than with using existing knowledge because\nproduct development is an incremental process in which success comes from "patient,\nacross-the-board efforts to improve product processes and to develop moderately\ninnovative products that meet genuine consumer needs."37 Federal science and technology\npolicy continues to emphasize kno\\t,lc.d,qecmrtion, which cannot, in and of itself, ensure\nU.S. technological superiority. As Alic points out, "innovation depends heavily on existing\nknowledge, often more so than on new knowledge .... New knowledge, at least in the sense\nof research results, rarely has direct bearing on competitive o u t c o ~ n e s "and does not\n~~\nprovide an adequate foundation for competitiveness.\n\nThe Need for Diffusion-Oriented Technology Policy\nInnovation is an inherently uncertain undertaking that involves the use of human and\nfinancial resources coupled with knowledge and technology to create new or improve\nexisting products, processes. and services. As a system. innovation interacts with\ngovernment at two basic levels. The first relates to harnessing knowledge and technology\nfor public purposes. The second arises from the reliance of innovation on social context:\nthat is. education and training to create a skilled workforce; a legal framework for defining\nand enforcing intellectual property rights, laws and regulations conducive to innovation as\nan esse~itial\nengine of growth: and a variety of public policies that support the production,\ntransfer. and use of knowledge and technology.39 U.S. technology policy is considered\n\nblaximizing Federally-li~ndec!\nRBD\n\nI b3\n\n"mission-oriented" because it focuses on radical innovation to achieve clearly established\ngoals (e.g., military) of national importance. Ergas states that "the provision of innovatedrelated public goods is only a secondary concern of U.S. technology policy." In contrast,\n"diffusion-oriented" technology policy, utilized by such countries as Germany,\nSwitzerland, Sweden, and, to a great extent, Japan, is bound up in the provision of public\ngoods, and "has as its principal purpose the diff~~sion technological capt~bilities\nof\nthroughout the industrial structure, and facilitates the ongoing and mainly incremental\nadaptation to change."40\nWith its emphasis on mission-oriented R&D, current U.S. science and technology\npolicy emphasizes the supply or the creation of knowledge rather than its transfer and use.\nMission-oriented science and technology policy may have been effective when the U~~ited\nStates enjoyed untlisputed econo~iiic\nhegemony, but it mi~y be atlvantageous in t o i l i ~ y \' ~\nnot\nenvironment in which U.S. firms are challenged by foreign competitors in sotile littlcls, i u ~ c l\nare struggling to regain their former positions in others.41 Indeed, ~ r a n s c o m b ~ ?\nposits that\nthe U.S. loss of competitiveness in various industries and technologies has rendered\nobsolete many of the assumptions that drive existing U.S. science and technology policy.\nAccording to ~ranscomb:~the U.S. needs a diffusion-oriented or capability-enhanci~~g\ntechnology policy that includes, among other things, managing the transfer and use of\nc ~ ~\nknowledge and technology. ~ l i notes that the process of diffusion, which results in\nindividuals and organizations learning Srom each other ilnd thereby extending knowledge,\nis less effective in the United States than in countries like Japan that have dil\'l\'usionoriented science and technology policies. Although federal policy touches on many of the\nelements required for successful innovation (e.g., availability of capital, antitrust\nregulations, and intellectual property protection), the diffusion of existing knowledge "has\nyet to he invited to the technology policy\n\nThe Prevailing Dissemination Model\nThe dissemination model recognizes that the results of federally-funded R&D will not\nnecessarily be sought after, the supply (production) of data, information, and knowledge is\nnot sufficient to ensure its utilization, and intervention at the producer level is requiretl to\nprovide potential users with the access linkages. (Linkage mechanisms include various\ninformation products and services, as well as intermediaries.) This one-w9cry,pt-odl(c.ot--rouser approach assumes that these linkage mechanisms, in and of themselves, are sufficient\nto ensure that the results of federally-funded science and technology will be utilized\nbecause they provide opportunities for users to determine what knowledge is available,\nacquire it, and apply it to their needs. The strength of this model rests on the recognition\nthat transfer and use (in addition to production) are critical elements of the process of\ntechnological innovation. Its weakness lies in the fact that the one-way, producer-to-user\napproach is passive in that users are considered only when they interact with or contact the\nsystem for assistance. The existing federal system is based on a dissemination model and\nen~ploysone-way, producer-to-user procedures that are seldom responsive in the user\ncontext. User requirements and behaviors are not known or considered in the design of\nlinkage mechanisms. This model does not take into account the process of technological\ninnovation at the level of the firm, nor does it acknowledge that small, medium, and large\nfirms interact differently with the external environment. Lastly, this 111odel fails to\n\n164\n\nCiOVERNMENT INFORMATIONQUARTERLY Vol. 151No. 211998\n\nrecognize that the willingness and ability of firms to absorb extramurally produced\nresearch results vary from industry to industry.\nEffective knowledge transfer is hindered because the federal government "has no\ncoherent or systematically designed approach to transferring the results of federally-funded\nresearch to the user.\'d6 The system for disseminating the results of federally-funded R&D\nis "passive, fragmented. and i~nfocused."~~\nApproaches to transferring knowledge vary\nfrom agency to agency and have changed significantly over time. They reflect differences\nhow agencies interpret their missions, and,\nbetween agencies (i-e., legislative ~nandates),\nniost important. budgetary opportunities and constraints. In their study of federal scientific\nand technical information activities. Bikson, Quint. and Johnson found that many of the\nindividuals they interviewed believed that "dissemination activities were afterthoughts,\nundertaken without serious commitment by federal agencies whose primary concerns were\nwith [knowledge] production and not with knowledge transfer and use:" therefore, "much\nof\' what has been learned about knowledge diffusion has not been incorporated into\nactivities designed to transfer the results of federally-funded R&D from producers to\nLlscrs.7.48\nBy and large. the programs undertaken by the federal R&D agencies to disseminate the\nresults of government-funded R&D have been ineffective in stimulating technological\ninnovation and in transferring technology.49 According to Roberts and Frohman, these\nprograms are the "highest in frequency and expense yet lowest in impact;" they "have led\nto few documented successes;" furthermore. they "start to encourage knowledge utilization\nrather than during the idea\nonly after the research results have been gene~ated,"~~)\ndevelopment phase of\' the innovation process. David,\n~ o w e r ~ .and Mowery and\n\'~\n~ 0 s e n b e 1 -coriclude that successful technological innovation rests more with the transfer\ng~~\nand\nand utilization of data, infor~iiation, knowledge than with their production.\nThe federal agencies\' systelns for disserniriating the results of government-funded R&D\nhave a formal and an informal component. The informal component relies on collegial\ncontacts. and the formal component relies on surrogates, information producers, and\ninformation intermediaries to effect the transfer of the results of governnieht-funded R&D\nfrom producer to user. Problematic to the irij~~rmul of the systern is that knowledge\npart\nusers can learn from collegial contacts only what those contacts happen to know. Ample\nthat\nevidence supports the clai~ii no one researcher can know about or keep up with all the\nresearch in his or her area(s) of interest. Like other members of the scientific community,\nengineers and scientists are faced with the problem of too much data, information, and\nknowledge to know about, to keep up with, and to screen. Furthermore, information is\nbecoming more interdisciplinary in nature and more international in scope. Two problems\noneexist with the.for-rim1part of the system. First, the formal part of the system e~nploys\nway, source-to-user transmissioti. The problem with this approach is that such formal oneway, "supply side" transfer procedures do not seem to be responsive to the users\'\nco~~texts..\'~\nRather, these efforts appear to start with a system into which the users\'\nThe\nrequirements are retr~fitted..\'~ consensus of the findings from empirical research is\nare\nthat interactive, two-way co~n~nuriications required to transfer data, information, and\nknowledge effectively from producers to users.s6\nSecond, the formal part of the system relies heavily on information intermediaries to\ncornplete the producer-to-user process. However, a strong methodological base for\n\nt\n,\n\n.\n\nnleasuring or assessing the effectiveness of the information intermediary is ~acking.~\'\nIn\nitclclilion, empirical data on the effectiveness of inli)rmation intt.rriicciiaries i111ti the roltt(s)\nthey play in knowledge transfer are sparse and i~iconclusive.The impact of infomation\nintermediaries is likely to be strongly conditional and limited to a specific institutional\n~ontext.~"n the case of the NASA system, information intermediaries report that ( I ) they\ndo not view NASA as a proactive partner in diffusing the results of federally-funded R&D,\n(2) NASA lacks a good understanding of the user community and the needs of users, (3)\nlittle communication occurs between the intermediaries and NASA, and (4) NASA devotes\nlittle effort to involving information intermediaries in the knowledge transfer process.50\n\nA KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\nFOR THE FEDERAL SYSTEM\nA knowledge management program for the federal R&D agencies presumes a proactive,\ncollaborative relationship (partnership) between U.S. industry and the federal government\nwith respect to knowledge diffusion. It also presupposes that U.S. industry and the federal\nR&D agencies recognize the value of knowledge as a competitive asset arid possess a\ncapacity to absorb external knowledge. To enhance their core capi~bilities, both will\nactively seek to identify, import, and integrate external knowledge and technology into\nU.S. industry will then Socus\ntheir internal organizational anrl agency know~edgebases."~\'\non channeling knowledge and technology resultil~g from federnlly-fi~ntled RSrll to\nindividuals and teams that can make the best use of them. Developing a knowledge\n~iianitgement\nframework requires that the federal R&D agencies do the following: 6 I\n\nI . Design a plan that identifies agency objectives and needs for managing knowledge;\n2. Audit agency knowledge bases to ascertain what knowledge currently exists, where\nit resides, if duplication or redundancy is warranted, and what additional knowledge\nmay be needed;\n3. Identify and assign responsibilities for knowledge managenient activities;\n4. Design and implement specific policies and methods that include measurement (of\neffectiveness) criteria;\n5. Create a tecl~nologicalinfrastructure that provides a repository of explicit knowledge and pointers to tacit knowledge, permits collaboration and sharing, and facilitates the diffusion of new and existing knowledge; and\n6 . Promulgate standards, practices, and rules of interaction.\nEstablishing such a framework requires a shared vision, effective leadership that\nchalnpions such a program, and a collaborative approach to development that relies heavily\n011 input from trsers and prospective users.62\nIn light of today\'s global economy, the new mission of the federal R&D agencies should\nbe to promote ilnd improve U.S. competitiveness. The existing federal system for\nbe\ndisseminating the results of federally-funded R&D s110~1ld reconfigured to support and\nenable knowledge managenient to maximize the "retirrn on investment" in federallyfunded R&D by meeting industry needs for external knowledge, technology, and expertise.\nAn effective knowledge management framework would stimulate the diffilsion itnd\n\n166\n\nGOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 15/No. 2/1998\n\nutilization of the results of federally-funded R&D by speeding flows of "user-friendly"\nknowledge to consumers in U.S. industry.63 Creating such a framework will require\ncrafting a coherent U.S. technology and information policy that recognizes, values, and\nleverages the knowledge resultjng from federally-funded R&D.\nA knowledge management fran~ework the federal R&D agencies would provide the\nfor\nstrategies, methods, and tools to advance and cultivate the production, transfer, and use of\nknowledge throughout U.S. industry. To remain competitive. successful firms have had to\nbecome highly flexible and adaptive, forging strategic alliances with customers, suppliers,\nand distributors, and offering customized products and services that represent custorner\nparticipation in design. manufacture, and distribution. A knowledge management structure\nat the level of the federal R&D agencies would also have to recognize and heed the\nimplications of the changed nature of business relationships among U.S. firms. Developing\na basic knowledge management structure to optimize diffusion of the results of federallyfunded R&D would require taking the following action^:\'^\nModel (i.e.. categorize and represent) knowledge in a problem-solution context\nthat not only promotes the diffusion of explicit knowledge but also supports the\nelicitation of tacit knowledge. The knowledge model should be based on userspecified needs and should represent knowledge in standard, non-proprietary formats to ensure its reusability and longevity.\nArray consistently (according to agreed upon standards and formats) the knowledge resulting from such R&D activities so that users can easily identify, acquire.\nevaluate, interpret. and integrate it into their internal knowledge bases.\nMonitor (i.e., acquire), screen, evaluate, interpret, and integrate relevant published\n(explicit) knowledge originating outside the United States into the agencies\'\nknowledge bases for diffusion to industries that can integrate and apply it for competitive advantage.\nOptimize the two-way flow of explicit and tacit knowledge by sponsoring and supposting infosmnl technical discussions; conferences. symposia, and workshops; contracts with industry; non-contract cooperative programs; technology demonstration\nprograms; and government-academia-industry personnel exchange programs.\nDevelop mechanisms that help knowledge seekers identify and locate relevant\nsources of tacit knowledge and expertise (i.e., subject-matter experts) through the\ncreation of such information technology-enabled products as online yellow pages.\nDevelop mechanisms that facilitate awareness among members of industry sectors\nof explicit knowledge and that include announcements and updates of recently initiated and on-going federally-funded R&D activities (e.g.. research and technology operating plans) and federally-sponsored research (e.g., grants and research\ncontracts).\nEstablish guidelines and mechanisms for knowledge diffusion to ensure that fordo\neign co~npetitors not benefit unduly from receiving the results of U.S. federallyfunded R&D.\nEvaluate the knowledge exchanged as a result of bilateral agreements with foreign\ngovernments and institutions to ensure quid pm quo on the basis of quantity and\nquality.\n\n.\n\nMaximizing Federally-T~~ncletl\nR&V\n\nIt17\n\n9. Develop nlechanisms for identifying and tracking the activities and expertise of\nforeign research and R&D programs, facilities, and personnel (i.e., coinpetitive\nintelligence) and diffuse it to interested parties within U.S. industry.\n10. Develop evaluation components with metrics that rely on user input and feetlhack\nfor determining the knowledge needs of U.S. industry sectors and assessing the\nefficacy of the federal agencies\' knowledge management programs.\n1 1 . Recognize knowledge management as a legitimate element of the research process, and identify and assign responsibilities for inanaging knowledge at all levels\nof federal R&D agencies.\n12. Budget and allocate funding for knowledge management activities through the\nfederal R&D budget and programs to ensure that knowledge diffiision becomes an\nintegral part of\'the R&D process.\n\nISSUES AND CHALLENGES FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT\nKnowledge management programs at both the industry and federal levels should focus on\nthe management of knowledge as an intellectual iisset. Whatever focus and techniques iire\nused (e.g., best practices, decision-making, learning organization, accounting, or\ntechnology),65 the critical nature of knowledge and of managing it effectively should be\ndemonstrated in the organization\'s mission and vision, and knowledge management\npractices should be iinplemented and rewarded at all levels of an organization. Programs\nfor managing knowledge inust be adequately funded and staffed, lest we find ourselves\nof\ninfrastructure, such\npaying the price for ignorance. Compone~lts the existing infor~nation\nas libraries, inust rethink their purpose and refocus their activities to support knowledge\nmanagement. The theoretical bases underlying knowledge management programs should\nalso incorporate what is known about technological innovation, including how knowledge\nand technology diffuse at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels.\nKnowledge voids (i.e., what is not known about technological innovation) should inspire\nfurther investigation, the results of which can be applied to managing knowledge fix\nco~npetitive\nadvantage.\nFor knowledge management to be successful at both industry and federal levels, certain\nchallenges must be addressed. Some priority tasks are discussed below.\nAt the federal level, within the federal system, and at the agency level, knowledge\ndiffusion lnust become part of the R&D process in both word and deed. Fecleral\ninformation policy, where absent, must be formulated and directly tied (linked) to\ntechnology policy. In today\'s competitive environment, diffusing the results of federallyfunded R&D cannot continue to be considered an overhead (burden) expense. Adequate\nfunding inust be provided and such federal agencies as the Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy (OSTP) that have a legislative inandate to ( 1 ) promote the transfer and\nutilization of federal scientific and technical inforination (STI) for civilian needs; (2)\nconsider the potential role of information technology in the transfer process; and (3)\ncoordinate federal ST1 policy and practices, must be held accountable by the Congress for\napparently having abdicated their responsibilities. Finally, a coherent, systen~aticallydesigned approach to knowledge diffusion is needed at the federal level. The largely\n\n101)\n\nCiOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY Vol. 15/No. 211 998\n\npassive. one-way, producer-to-user distribution model must be replaced with a proactive,\ntwo-way. collaborative "enterprise" knowledge diffusion model.Bb\nAlthough information technology (IT) will play an important role in knowledge\ndiffusion, IT in and of itself cannot guarantee the success of any knowledge management\ninitiative. Diffusing knowledge effectively has far more to do with the human side of the\nequation. Research concerned with technological innovation points out the importance of\nIiunian interaction, human behavior, and information use and exchange. Clearly, an\nunderstanding of the user in a behavioral and organizational context is needed. However,\nthe rcsults of numerous inforii~ation-seeking\nbehavior and use studies conducted over the\npast 30 years are fragmented and ambiguous. The results have riot accumulated to form a\nsignificant body of knowledge that can be used by inforination professionals, and they\nofkr littlc in the wily of guidance or "rulcs of thumb" for R&D niaiiagers. On tlie otlicr\nIlalld. there is ample evidence that what has been learned about the infortnation-seeking\nbehaviors and uses of engineers engaged in R&D and technological innovation has not\nbeen incorporated into the information systelns designed to service this populatio~i.As\nPinelli" notes, two actions are required: development of a research agenda and creation of\na method of linking research results with the individuals concerned with the design and\nprovision of infortnation systems. policy. products, and services.\nOf all the organizational units within a firm, the library is well suited to help matiape\nknowledge as an intellectual asset and to play a major role in knowledge diffusion.\nDavenport and Prusak"\' claim that libraries, while uniquely positioned within the\norganization to understand information requirements and to distribute information, have\nlargely been left behind by the infor~iiationrevolution, most likely because they are based\non an obsolete model of information provision. Libraries are poorly understood, usually\nnot well integrated with cithcr tlic husincss they serve or other infc~rtnation-orientcd\nfiinctions. As a result, the value tlicy deliver is often unclear and often less than what is\npossible. Consequently, libraries and library services remain vulnerable to cost-cutting\nefforts by both managers aid li&D orgal~izations.To play a major role in knowledge\nmanagcmcnt. libraries should enlphasize tlic following: ( I ) proactivity over passivity; (2)\ntlic l~rovision informatioil rather than docuri~ents; (3) the provision of information in\nof\narid\n;I problem-solution context."" Both libraries and librarians lnust look at ways of adding\nvalue that go beyond the information acquisition, classification, and storage model. Lastly.\nthcrc is a great need to understand how people use and value inforniation. Librarians are\nbetter positioned than many other groups within the firm to contribute to and build upon\nthis unclcrstanding to help lnariagc knowledge for competitive advantage.\nStudies concerned with technological innovation at the firm level demonstrate the\ncriticality of information to innovation. the importance of smooth information flows within\nthe firm, and the value of importing information that resides external to the firm for .\nmaintaining competitive advantage. The need to manage data. information, and knowledge\neffectively is of paramount importance; in fact, managing these resources is increasingly\nconsidered the responsibility of every tnetnber of a firm. Within R&D, engineers are\nobvious candidates for knowledge management responsibilities, given the informationintensive nature of their work and tlie time they devote to working with information-up\nto SO% of their work weeks.\'(\' Thus, engineers should be proficient in the skills required\nIbr the effective production. transfer. and use of data. information. and knowledge. Such\n\nskills include ( 1 ) the ability to colninunicate effectively in writing, orally, and visually; (2)\na knowledge and understanding of the nature and use of engineering and science resources\nand materials; (3) competence in using a library and a variety of other information\nrepositories and resources; (4) computer, communication, and information technology use\ncapabilities; ( 5 )the ability to work collaboratively and to share and elicit information; and\n(6) competence in one or more foreign languages.\nKnowledge is becoming a key resource in the global economy. It has replaced financial\ncapital as the main producer of wealth. If nations and firnis ;we to compete on the basis of\nknowledge, they must learn to treat knowledge as a capital asset, not as the by-product of\nTo\na process, design, service, or product developn~ent. ensure the competitiveness of the\nnation and the firm, traditional approaches to management have concentrated on\nminimizing overhead, cutting staff, and decreasing mitterial costs as a means of\nmaxin~izingsales and increasing market share. However, these measures are liirgrly\nineffective for u knowledge-husetl economy. \'l\'o colnpetl: ill ;I global, knowlcclge-Ix~wcl\neconomy, the nation and firms have to learn to value and manage intellectual capital, which\nrequires a different approach from the one used to manage financial capital. Today\'s global\neconomy is characterized by ( 1 ) the rapid internationalization of markets and technology,\n(2) the spread of innovative activity, (3) fierce competition among firms and nations for\nmarkets and market share, (4) nlilltiple numbers of strategic alliances and partnerships\nirnlortg firms to irnprove competitive position, ancl ( 5 ) the consecluent transfer 01\'\nknowledge and technology among allied iirnls ancl nations. Maintaining competitive~less\nin such an environment makes the astute nlanagement of knowledge by the nation and the\nfirm not only desirable but also imperative. Failure to manage knowledge and technology,\nconsidered by some to be the weapons of choice in a global economic war, could spell\ndisaster for the nation and U.S. firms.\n\nJ)([/it.siol~\nAcknowledgments: This article is iun adaptation of chapter 10 in K~lo\\~~lec/~qc~\nill the U.S. Arl-o.sl)rrce 11ltirr.srty: Mtrtzcrging Kizo~~le~/,qe Co~~ll>etifi\\~e\nji)r\nAtlvcrr~tcrgc~\n(Greenwich, CT: Ablex Publishing, 1997), pp. 89 1-947.
