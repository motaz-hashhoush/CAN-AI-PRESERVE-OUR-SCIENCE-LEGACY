This is especially important because the\nouter walls of pressurized volumes are often not easily accessible, blocked by\nracks or cabinets. The goal of the Habitat Particle Impact Monitoring System\n(HIMS) is to develop a fully automated, end-to-end particle impact detection\nsystem for crewed space exploration modules. The HIMS uses multiple passive,\nthin film piezo-polymer vibration sensors to detect impacts on a surface, and\ncomputer processing of the acoustical signals to characterize the impacts.\nDevelopment and demonstration of the HIMS is proceeding in concert with\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Habitat Demonstration Unit (HDU) Project. The HDU Project is designed\nto develop and test various technologies, configurations, and operational\nconcepts for exploration habitats.\nThis paper describes the HIMS development, initial testing, and HDU integration\nefforts. Initial tests of the system on the HDU were conducted at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s 2010\nand 2011 Desert Research and Technologies Studies (Desert-RATS or DRATS). The HDU lab module, as seen from above, has an open circular\nfloorplan divided into eight wedge-shaped Segments. The side wall of the\nmodule \xe2\x80\x93 the surface used for this technology demonstration \xe2\x80\x93 is a hard\nfiberglass composite covered with a layer of sprayed-on foam insulation. Four\nsensor locations were assigned near the corners of a rectangular pattern on the\nwall of one segment of the HDU lab module. The flat, self-adhesive sensors\nwere applied to the module during its initial outfitting. To study the influence of\nthe wall\xe2\x80\x99s construction (thickness and materials), three sets of four sensors were\ninstalled at different layer depths: on the interior of the module\xe2\x80\x99s wall, on the\nexterior of the same wall, and on the exterior of the foam insulation. The signal\nproduced when a vibration passes through a sensor is first sent through a preamplifier. The amplified signal then is sent to the data acquisition and data\nprocessing systems. The vibration data from the sensors are then processed\nand reduced to a form suitable for presentation to the crew.\nFor the HIMS HDU technology demonstration, particle impacts were simulated by\nfiring a pneumatic pellet gun at the exterior wall section. Impact signals from the\nsensors were recognized by the data acquisition system when they occurred,\nproducing a \xe2\x80\x9ctrigger\xe2\x80\x9d event. The data acquisition system ran continuously,\n\nallowing it to retain a certain amount of pre-trigger data, which provided the full\nevent data from all sensors. In the first phase of the demonstration, conducted at\nJSC and at the 2010 D-RATS, the HIMS data-acquisition and recording functions\nwere housed in their own stand-alone, portable computer. The system simply\nrecorded each event\xe2\x80\x99s data on the computer for later analysis. Background noise\ndata were also collected by recording all sensor outputs during normal HDU\noperations. The combined data were used to develop the software to detect,\ndiscriminate, and characterize the impacts. Detection was accomplished by\nsetting a trigger level higher than the system\xe2\x80\x99s background noise and lower than\nthe lowest test impact\xe2\x80\x99s signal. Non-acoustic false signals (typically electrical\nspikes) were rejected using a waveform-duration criterion, based on the ratio of\nenergy to peak voltage. The position of the impacts is derived using a technique\nof multilateration, analyzing the differences in signal arrival times at the different\nsensor locations. The degree of impact penetration is determined by analyzing\nsignal strength as a function of time. Upon completion of this first phase, the\nHIMS system located the point of impact to within 8 cm, provided a measure of\nthe impact energy / damage produced, and was insensitive to other acoustic\nevents.\nThe second phase of the HIMS HDU technology demonstration, completed at the\n2011 D-RATS, assessed the performance of a fully automated, real-time version\nof the system. This system was integrated into the HDU systems, using the lab\xe2\x80\x99s\ndata-acquisition, network, processing, and information display infrastructure. The\nstand-alone computer, used in the first phase, also demonstrated the real-time\nsoftware and provided easier access to diagnostic information. The integrated\nsystem passes the processed results of an impact event to the crew\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaution/Warning\xe2\x80\x9d system, which displays information on a tablet computer. The\nimpact location is displayed graphically on an image of the module wall, along\nwith a table listing the position, severity, and time of the event. The real-time\nHIMS yielded the expected level of performance (8-cm location accuracy, good\nfalse-alarm rejection) demonstrated by the developmental system in the first\nphase.\nAs the HDU project moves forward as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Advanced Exploration\nSystems Program, the HIMS is now being advanced for more complex\nstructures, including multi-layer composites and inflatable modules. Work this\nyear involves extending the system to the Bigelow multi-layer inflatable for the\nInternational Space Station, a structure which may particularly benefit from the\ninclusion of this type of impact monitoring system. This structure presents new\nchallenges since the signals will experience greater attenuation as they travel on\nthis highly-damped structure, but correspondingly the background noise levels\nshould be lower. Based on previous successful hypervelocity tests on multi-layer\ninsulation (MLI), fabrics and stretched membranes, we expect that only minor\nmodifications will be required to our system to optimize it for use with this type of\nstructure. In particular, we are amplifying the signals at the sensors to\n\naccommodate the anticipated lower signal levels, and to permit longer cable runs\nthan the current five meters. The aim of this year\xe2\x80\x99s study is to determine the\noptimal sensor spacing, and identify the likely relative background noise levels on\nstructures of this type.\n\n'
