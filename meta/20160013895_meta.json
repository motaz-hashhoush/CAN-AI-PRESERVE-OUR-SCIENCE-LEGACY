These largely canceled out such that the global land surface began and ended the year with a terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomaly slightly below 0 cm (equivalent height of water; Fig. 2.22). TWS is the sum of groundwater, soil moisture, surface water, snow, and ice. Groundwater responds more slowly to meteorological phenomena than the other components because the overlying soil acts as a low pass filter, but often it has a larger range of variability on multiannual timescales (Rodell and Famiglietti 2001; Alley et al. 2002).In situ groundwater data are only archived and made and Tanzania. The rest of the continent experienced mixed to dry conditions. Significant reductions in TWS in Greenland, Antarctica, and southern coastal Alaska reflect ongoing ice sheet and glacier ablation, not groundwater depletion.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "96", "submissionId": 20160013895, "issue": "7", "issn": "0003-0007", "publisher": "AMS Publications", "eissn": "1520-0477", "id": "527c3376c8cb41499fad0dc263b4bccc", "publicationName": "Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society", "publicationDate": "2015-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
