Performance of the two stage Delta launch vehicle was nominal and placed the payload in a low circular orbit as planned. The Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), which is part of the payload, also performed nominally. The synchronous transfer orbital elements achieved by Delta/PAM, compared with the nominal expected, are provided. The satellite performed satisfactorily during the transfer orbit, and the ABM was fired successfully at 5:29 p.m., EDT, on August 29, 1982. The satellite was maneuvered to a position 104 degrees West Longitude above the equator. Satellite status is satisfactory and it has entered service.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830009301, "id": "aca81d3179304aaab66f3d4e8d89ab7a", "publicationDate": "1983-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830009301.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830009301/downloads/19830009301.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830009301/downloads/19830009301.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830009301/downloads/19830009301.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
