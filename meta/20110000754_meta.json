Work for that mission and others has helped SEAKR become the world leader in SSR technology for spacecraft. The company has delivered more than 100 systems, more than 85 of which have launched onboard NASA, military, and commercial spacecraft including imaging satellites that provide much of the high-resolution imagery for online mapping services like Google Earth.", "title": "Solid-State Recorders Enhance Scientific Data Collection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T09:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110000754, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110000754, "id": "1e010716464842d596a091c22dd75ff7", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110000754.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110000754/downloads/20110000754.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110000754/downloads/20110000754.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110000754/downloads/20110000754.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
