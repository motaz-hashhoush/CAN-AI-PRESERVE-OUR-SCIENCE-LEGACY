Various assumed stratospheric weighting profiles were tested to determine whether the theoretical channel 4 weighting function had significant errors. It was found that the real weighting function is slightly sharper than the theoretical weighting function. We also found evidence for a step-function cooling in the radiosonde record during 1982, a period when two satellites were operating with no evidence of changes in the satellites. Lower tropospheric bulk temperature datasets continue to be sent to climate researchers and modelers, as well as to the Climate Analysis Center (CAC). The CAC is also implementing our MSU software to be able to do the MSU processing at their site. Drift in MSU channel 3 is being quantified and corrected to allow it to be used together with channel 2 for a better lowertropospheric gridpoint temperature product. A new global oceanic precipitation dataset has been produced from MSU channel 1 data, and compared to ten years of global raingage data.", "title": "Global temperature variations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930010879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Spencer, Roy W."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "59bd82963bd44c85a5e47f66e974ffb1"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930010879, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Christy, John R."}, "organization": {"name": "Alabama Univ.", "location": "Huntsville., United States"}}, "id": "a6d69e1b66ad4ce6a4f2b52d46b5931a"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930010879, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930010879, "id": "b2477c8c81d84440abedfc0143c02808", "publicationName": "NASA(MSFC FY92 Earth Science and Applications Program Research Review", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930010878, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA/MSFC FY92 Earth Science and Applications Program Research Review", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930010879.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930010879/downloads/19930010879.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930010879/downloads/19930010879.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930010879/downloads/19930010879.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
