Although it is readily recognized that there is a need for ground truth to provide adequate guidance for remote sensing data interpretation, it is noted that, in terms of radar remote sensing, this ground truth is often inadequate. It is necessary to make basic electrical and physical measurements of the surface and to some depth below it. A brief outline is presented of a ground truth scheme which uses measurements of the dielectric constant. Two portable instruments were designed specifically for this purpose; these were: (1) a Q-meter for measurement of dielectric constant and loss tangent; and (2) an instrument to measure electrical properties of the two operating frequencies of the imaging radar. Although extensive data are lacking, several general cases of radar-earth surface and interaction are described; also, examples of radar imagery and some data on ice and snow are presented. It is concluded that the next logical step is to begin to quantify the radar ground truth in preparation for machine interpretation and automatic data processing of the radar imagery.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730011626, "id": "80fa20c2b28c44b8bc692995ed546f2b", "publicationName": "Process. and Analysis of ERTS-1 Remotely Sensed Data", "publicationDate": "1973-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19730011622, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Processing and Analysis of ERTS-1 Remotely Sensed Data", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
