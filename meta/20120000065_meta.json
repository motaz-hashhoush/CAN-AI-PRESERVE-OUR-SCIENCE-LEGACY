Long operating life and reliable performance are critical requirements for these applications. Accordingly, long-term materials compatibility is being evaluated through the use of high-temperature life test heat pipes. Thermacore, Inc., has carried out a sodium heat pipe 10-year life test to establish long-term operating reliability. Sodium heat pipes have demonstrated favorable materials compatibility and heat transport characteristics at high operating temperatures in air over long time periods. A representative one-tenth segment Stirling Space Power Converter heat pipe with an Inconel 718 envelope and a stainless steel screen wick has operated for over 87,000 hr (10 years) at nearly 700 C. These life test results have demonstrated the potential for high-temperature heat pipes to serve as reliable energy conversion system components for power applications that require long operating lifetime with high reliability. Detailed design specifications, operating history, and post-test analysis of the heat pipe and sodium working fluid are described. Lessons learned and future life test plans are also discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120000065, "endDate": "2011-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space (NETS-2011)", "location": "Albuquerque, NM", "id": "47201d4af53f4449bdf76276ff6903e8", "startDate": "2011-02-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120000065, "id": "42fe382cde75477182809f07106e7c50", "publicationDate": "2011-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120000065.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120000065/downloads/20120000065.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120000065/downloads/20120000065.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120000065/downloads/20120000065.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
