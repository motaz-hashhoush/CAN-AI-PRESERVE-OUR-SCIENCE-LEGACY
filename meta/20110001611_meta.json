From a system that could be brought to Florida in the trunk of a car in the 1950's. Including the development of larger and more complex launch vehicles with the Apollo program where human launch controllers managed the launch process with a hardware only system that required a dedicated human interface to perform every function until the Apollo vehicle lifted off from the pad. Through the development of the digital computer that interfaced with ground launch processing systems with the Space Shuttle program. Finally, showing the future control room being developed to control the missions to return to the moon and Mars, which will maximize the use of Commercial-Off-The Shelf (COTS) hardware and software which was standards based and not tied to a single vendor. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to support the requirements of future spacecraft and launch vehicles.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110001611, "endDate": "2011-02-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "NASA Project Management Challenge 2011", "location": "Long Beach, CA", "id": "cbb90db355e244c6a6b99a4a84057a3a", "startDate": "2011-02-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110001611, "id": "6a1c0764552f4babb9b55bd4bf879ee0", "publicationDate": "2011-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110001611.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110001611/downloads/20110001611.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110001611/downloads/20110001611.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110001611/downloads/20110001611.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
