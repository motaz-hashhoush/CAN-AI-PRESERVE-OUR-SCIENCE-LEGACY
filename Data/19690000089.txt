Modified multistep predictor\xe2\x80\x94corrector methods for general initial-value problems are\ndiscussed and new methods are introduced. Preliminary numerical evidence indicates that this process is\nfaster and more accurate than similar methods applied\nto equivalent systems of first-order equations.\nThe investigation was prompted by a desire to deal\nwith higher-order equations directly, rather than converting them to a larger system of first-order equations. It was found that the Nordsieck-type methods\n(N methods) were the most applicable to higher-order\nequations since the derivatives are directly available.\nIn pursuing the relation between multistep methods\nand N methods, a large class of modified multistep\nmethods became apparent. These k-step methods can\nhave degree 2k, be strongly stable, and yet only use\none derivative evaluation.\nAn equivalence relation between the methods was\ndetermined. The Nordsieck formulation was found to\nbe best for high-accuracy problems, but for low-accuracy problems either the N methods or versions of the\nnew methods should be used. The conventional Adams\nmultistep methods should almost never be used.\nThe system of equations studied consisted of s equations in the s unknowns y 1 , their first p i derivatives,\nand the independent varIable x. The most general case\nfor which concrete results are given is when these\nequations can be solved for the highest-order derivatives of each y1\nFor didactic reasons, the first sections of the report\ndeal with the simplest case, s = p = 1, in order to\n\nprepare for discussions of the advantages of various\nformulations. Later, the N methods are applied directly\nto the above equation. A numerical comparison of the\nresults of integrating the second-order equation describing J 16 (x) directly and integrating the related\npair of first-order equations is reported. Evidence indicates both a time and accuracy advantage in the\ndirect approach. Some preliminary tests on the integration of singular families are also reported.\nFinally, existence and convergence proofs are presented. The matrix formulation used provides a convergence proof equivalent to the usual proof, but considerably more compact and applicable to the system.\n\nNotes:\n1.
