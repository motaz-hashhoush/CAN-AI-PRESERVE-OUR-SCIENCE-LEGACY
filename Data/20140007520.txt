b'MAINTAINING AURA\xe2\x80\x99S ORBIT REQUIREMENTS WHILE PERFORMING ORBIT\nMAINTENANCE MANEUVERS CONTAINING AN ORBIT NORMAL DELTA-V\nCOMPONENT\nMegan R. Johnson(1), Jeremy D.

Under nominal science operations for Aura, the propulsion system is oriented\nsuch that the resultant thrust vector is aligned 13.493 degrees away from the velocity vector\nalong the yaw axis. When performing orbit maintenance maneuvers, the spacecraft performs a\nyaw slew to align the thrust vector in the appropriate direction. A new Drag Make Up (DMU)\nmaneuver operations scheme has been implemented for Aura alleviating the need for the 13.493\ndegree yaw slew. The focus of this investigation is to assess the impact that no-slew DMU\nmaneuver operations will have on Aura\xe2\x80\x99s Mean Local Time (MLT) which drives the required\nalong track separation between Aura and the constellation members, as well as Aura\xe2\x80\x99s frozen\norbit properties, eccentricity and argument of perigee. Seven maneuver strategies were analyzed\nto determine the best operational approach. A mirror pole strategy, with maneuvers alternating\nat the North and South poles, was implemented operationally to minimize impact to the MLT.\nAdditional analysis determined that the mirror pole strategy could be further modified to include\nfrozen orbit maneuvers and thus maintain both MLT and the frozen orbit properties under noslew operations.\nKeywords: Aura, Earth Observing System (EOS), Afternoon Constellation, Mean Local Time,\nFrozen Orbit\n1. Introduction\nThe Afternoon Constellation consists of five member missions (GCOM-W1, Aqua, CALIPSO,\nCloudSat, and Aura) with OCO-2 joining the constellation in July 2014. These missions each\nmaintain a frozen, sun-synchronous orbit with a 16-day repeating ground track that follows the\nWorldwide Reference System-2 (WRS-2). Figure 1 provides a representation of the Afternoon\nconstellation members and their location within the constellation while Tab. 1 outlines the orbit\nproperties and requirements for Aura.\nTo maintain the orbit described above, each mission must maintain its Mean Local Time (MLT)\nof equator crossings to ensure consistent lighting conditions on Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface for each orbit.\nAdditionally, missions must also maintain a defined ground track to ensure repeatable data\ncollection. Perturbations to inclination and semi-major axis (SMA) cause changes to the sunsynchronous and repeating ground track properties of the orbit. Changes in MLT are\npredominately driven by luni-solar perturbations acting on the inclination of the orbit while\nchanges in the repeating ground track property are driven by changes in the SMA from\natmospheric drag. Each constellation member routinely performs annual Inclination Adjust\n\nManeuvers (IAM) and periodic Drag Make Up (DMU) maneuvers in order to compensate for\nthese perturbations, respectively.\n\nFigure 1. A visual representation of the Afternoon constellation showing each member\xe2\x80\x99s\nalong track phasing relative to Aqua.\nTable 1.

For\nDMU maneuvers, the spacecraft performs a 13.493 degree yaw slew to apply the delta-V purely\nin the velocity direction to maximize maneuver efficiency. The maneuver is performed at an\nargument of latitude which best maintains the frozen orbit properties (argument of perigee and\neccentricity). The argument of latitude varies for subsequent maneuvers because of the natural\n\nmovement of the eccentricity vector caused by Earth\xe2\x80\x99s odd numbered, harmonic gravitational\ncoefficients. The argument of perigee and eccentricity are coupled together and evolve in a 116\nday period cycle about the ideal values [2]. The frequency of DMU maneuvers is primarily a\nfunction of the drag environment. High solar flux conditions require more frequent DMU\nmaneuvers to make up for the accelerated SMA decay caused by increased atmospheric density.\nA new DMU maneuver operations scheme has been operationally utilized on the Aura satellite,\nalleviating the need for the 13.493 degree yaw slew. Removing this yaw slew results in a number\nof improvements to spacecraft operations and science acquisition including simplifying\nspacecraft commanding, minimizing required communications coverage during maneuvers,\nreducing the number of required man hours for the Flight Operations Team (FOT) when\nexecuting the maneuver, and reducing the amount of science data collection loss per maneuver.\nMan hours are reduced for the FOT because slewing the spacecraft requires additional time and\ncontacts. By removing this portion of the maneuver, there is also simplification when planning\nfor and executing Debris Avoidance Maneuvers (DAMs). Additionally, there are improvements\nin maneuver predictions and performance as removing the slew minimizes slew-induced attitude\nerrors before, during, and after the maneuver.\n1.2 Inclination Adjust Maneuvers (IAMs)\nAura, along with the rest of the Afternoon Constellation members, reference Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s MLT profile\nas the anchor for the constellation. Each mission is required to maintain a MLT separation from\nAqua which creates a desired along track separation necessary to facilitate mission safety and\nscience coordination. Table 2 outlines the along-track separation and WRS-2 ground track\nrequirements for each mission.\nTable 2. Mission requirements for the Afternoon constellation. Aqua acts as the reference\nmission for the Afternoon constellation. All of the along-track separation values are\nrelative to Aqua. Negative sign indicates the spacecraft flies ahead of Aqua [1].\nMission\n\nAlong-track separation at Equator WRS-2\nGround\n(seconds relative to Aqua)\nTrack Error (km)\n\nOCO-2\n\n-317.5 +/- 43 seconds\n\n0 +/- 20 km\n\nGCOM-W1\n\n-259.5 +/- 43 seconds\n\n0 +/- 20 km\n\nAqua\n\nReference Mission\n\n0 +/- 20 km\n\nCALIPSO\n\n73 +/- 21.5 seconds\n\n43 +/- 10 km\n\nCloudSat\n\n176 +/- 21.5 seconds\n\n45.3 +/- 10 km\n\nAura\n\n484 +/- 21.5 seconds\n\n18 +/- 20 km\n\nPrior to Aura\xe2\x80\x99s annual Inclination Adjust Maneuver (IAM) series, the flight dynamics teams for\neach mission plan their annual IAM schedule based on Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s nominal IAM plan and predicted\nMLT profile in order to maintain the required along-track separation. Under current operations,\nthe annual inclination series is the only opportunity in which a deliberate change in inclination is\nmade to Aura\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. This approach gives the constellation members the ability to plan their own\nmaneuver series in order to maintain the along-track separation requirements. Under the\nproposed no-slew DMU maneuver scheme, the 13.493 degree yaw offset from the velocity\nvector will add a small out-of-plane delta-v component. This small out-of-plane delta-v\ncomponent will add a combination of inclination or right ascension of the ascending node\n(RAAN) change based on the maneuver location.\nThe focus of this investigation is to assess the impact no-slew DMU maneuver operations will\nhave on Aura\xe2\x80\x99s frozen orbit properties and to assess the ability to preserve the required MLT\nseparation between Aqua and the constellation member. Following the successful\nimplementation of no-slew maneuvers for the Aura satellite, it is likely that Aqua will perform\noperational DMUs as no-slew. Additional concerns for Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s MLT as the reference mission in\nthe Afternoon Constellation led to Aura as the choice for operational testing.\n2. Effects of Out-of-Plane Acceleration on the Orbital Elements\nUnder no-slew operations, a small out-of-plane delta-v component will be introduced due to the\n13.493 degree yaw offset of the thrust vector from the velocity vector. Gauss\xe2\x80\x99s form of\nLagrange\xe2\x80\x99s planetary equations of motion for nonconservative forces describes the impact to the\norbital elements due to any combination of accelerations in the RSW frame [3]. In the RSW\nsystem, the R axis is parallel to the position vector. Along-track displacements are normal to the\nposition vector along the S axis. The W axis points in the instantaneous direction of the angular\nmomentum vector.\n\xdd\x80\xdc\xbd\n2\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8c\xe2\x80\xac\n=\n\xe1\x89\x80\xdd\x81 sin(\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8b + \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8c \xe1\x89\x81\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8a \xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\xce\xbe1 \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdd\x81 \xe0\xac\xb6\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\n\n(1)\n\n\xdd\x80\xdd\x81 \xce\xbe1 \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdd\x81 \xe0\xac\xb6\n\xdd\x81 + cos(\xe2\x80\xab)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n=\n\xe0\xb5\xacsin(\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8b + \xe0\xb5\xaccos(\xe2\x80\xab+ )\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xb5\xb0 \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8c \xe0\xb5\xb0\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\n\xdd\x8a\xdc\xbd\n1 + \xdd\x81 cos(\xe2\x80\xab)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n\n(2)\n\n\xdd\x80\xdd\x85\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\n=\n\xe2\x80\xab \xdc\xa8\xe2\x80\xaccos(\xe2\x80\xab)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xbd\xdd\x8a \xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6 \xce\xbe1 \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdd\x81 \xe0\xac\xb6 \xe0\xaf\xaa\n\n(3)\n\n\xdd\x80\xc8\xb3\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\nsin(\xe2\x80\xab)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n=\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x90\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xbd\xdd\x8a \xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6 \xce\xbe1 \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdd\x81 \xe0\xac\xb6\nsin(\xdd\x85)\n\n(4)\n\n\xdd\x80\xdf\xb1 \xce\xbe1 \xe0\xb5\x86 \xdd\x81 \xe0\xac\xb6\n\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\n=\n\xe0\xb5\x9c\xe0\xb5\x86 cos(\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8b + sin(\xe2\x80\xab )\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xb5\xac1 + \xe0\xb5\xb0 \xe2\x80\xab \xdc\xa8\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xb5\xa0\n\xe0\xac\xb6\xdd\x81\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\n\xe2\x80\xab \xdd\x8c\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa6\n\xdd\x8a\xdc\xbd\n\xe2\x80\xab \xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xaccot(\xdd\x85) sin(\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\n\xe0\xaf\xaa\n\xe0\xb5\x86\n\xdd\x84\n\n(5)\n\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xaf\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\xa2\n1\n= \xe0\xac\xb6 {(\xe2\x80\xab \xdd\x8c\xe2\x80\xaccos(\xe2\x80\xab )\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xb5\x86 2\xdd\x81\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x8e\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8b \xe0\xb5\x86 (\xe2\x80\xab )\xdd\x8e + \xdd\x8c\xe2\x80\xacsin(\xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xa8)\xdd\x92\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xaf\x8c }\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\n\xdd\x8a\xdc\xbd \xdd\x81\n\n(6)\n\nThree of the equations contain an out-of-plane acceleration component (F w ): inclination (Eq. 3),\nright ascension (Eq. 4), and argument of perigee (Eq. 5). Argument of perigee contains all three\nacceleration components; effects on the argument of perigee will not be studied in depth\nanalytically, but rather via simulations. As expected, inclination and right ascension are only a\nfunction of the out-of-plane component of acceleration. In fact, Eq. 3 and 4 are identical except\nfor the argument of latitude component (v) (the sin(i) component in the denominator for the right\nascension equation merely acts as a scaling factor). The relationship between inclination and\nright ascension is essentially a unit circle with inclination change on the x-axis, right ascension\nchange on the y-axis, and the argument of latitude (v) as the angle measured from the x-axis.\nThe propulsion system is oriented such that any out-of-plane delta-v component will be oriented\nalong the F w vector. Combining the thruster orientation with the unit circle relationship between\ninclination and right ascension, a simple understanding of the effects on the orbit plane based on\nthe location of the maneuver (argument of latitude) can be established. Maneuvering at the nodes\nproduces pure delta-i while maneuvering at the poles produces pure delta-RAAN. All other\nmaneuver locations produce a combination of both inclination and right ascension change.\nAdditionally, deleterious effects to the argument of perigee, and therefore the frozen orbit, will\nbe driven by the F w acceleration component.\n3. Constellation Flying\n3.1 Sun-Synchronous Orbits\nAs part of the Afternoon constellation, each member is required to maintain a sun-synchronous\norbit. Maintaining a sun-synchronous orbit is beneficial to science data as the lighting conditions\non the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface are nearly the same for every orbit. By definition, a satellite in a sunsynchronous orbit maintains the same angle relative to the Sun-Earth vector with noon defined as\nthe day side.\nIn order to maintain a constant MLT, the time rate of change of the right ascension must match\nthe rate of the secondary body around its primary. For the Sun-Earth system, this rate is 360\ndegrees per one Earth year. For classical two body mechanics, the right ascension is fixed once\nthe orbit plane is established; however, the Earth is not a perfect sphere. The J2 zonal coefficient\nis the prime perturbation that affects the right ascension of the orbit plane. Equation 7 governs\nthe time rate of change of the right ascension due to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s bulge at the equator [4].\n\xe0\xac\xb6\n\xdd\x80\xc8\xb3 \xe0\xb5\x863\xdd\x8a\xdc\xb4\xe0\xaf\x98 \xe2\x80\xab\xdc\xac\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6\n=\ncos(\xdd\x85)\n\xdd\x80\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x90\xe2\x80\xac\n2\xe2\x80\xab\xdd\x8c\xe2\x80\xac\xe0\xac\xb6\n\n(7)\n\nFor a sun-synchronous orbit, the above equation must equal 360 degrees per one Earth year.\nEquation 7 is a relationship between Earth\xe2\x80\x99s physical characteristics (Earth\xe2\x80\x99s oblateness\ncoefficient, J2, and radius) and the orbital elements of the spacecraft (inclination and semi-major\n\naxis). The semi-major axis required to stay on the WRS-2 path is fixed at 7077 km. With the\nsemi-major axis fixed, the only free variable remaining is inclination. Based on Eq. 7, the\ninclination must be fixed at 98.2 degrees in order to maintain a sun-synchronous orbit. Slight\nvariations in the inclination are enough to alter the time rate of change of the ascending node,\nthus affecting the MLT.\n3.2 Separation Requirements\nIn order to ensure safety and coordinate science between missions, each member of the\nconstellation flies within a control box defined by their MLT constraint and ground track error\nconstraint on the WRS-2 path. Aqua acts as the reference mission for the constellation. As such,\nall separation requirements are relative to Aqua and measured at the equator. Table 2 from the\nintroduction lists the along-track separation and ground track error requirements for each\nmember. In order to maintain these requirements, there are two methods for adjusting the along\ntrack separation: MLT control and ground track error control. MLT control is performed\nthrough maintenance of the inclination through the Spring IAM series in order to achieve a\nproper time rate of change for the right ascension while ground track error control is performed\nthrough semi-major axis maintenance with DMU maneuvers. The Spring IAM series occurs\naround the Vernal Equinox, for maximum efficiency, with 3+ maneuvers planned each year.\nEvery 1 km of ground track error is equivalent to 2.156 seconds of along track separation at the\nequator. Converting between ground track and along track separation in seconds is a simple\nconversion; Earth\xe2\x80\x99s rotation (86400 seconds / 360 degrees) times Earth\xe2\x80\x99s circumference (360\ndegrees / 40075 km) equals 2.156 seconds of along track separation at the equator per km of\nground track error.\nMLT is measured between 0 and 24 hours, with noon defined as the day side of the Sun-Earth\nline and midnight as the night side. When using this hourly definition, separation in terms of\nmeal local time difference is a one-to-one relationship with along track separation at the equator.\nAs an example, two missions that fly exactly on the WRS-2 path (ground track error equal to\nzero) but with a mean local time difference of one minute equates to 60 seconds of along track\nseparation at the equator.\nIn addition to flying within their defined control boxes, each mission must meet a +/- two second\nMLT prediction requirement between each Spring IAM series. In other words, the MLT\nprediction must be within +/- 2 seconds of the definitive MLT after one year. This requirement is\nespecially important for Aqua as it acts as the anchor mission for the constellation and all\nseparation requirements are based off of Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s MLT. Aura\xe2\x80\x99s MLT, referenced to Aqua, is 8.5\nminutes +/- 15 seconds.\n3.3 Complications Due to No-Slew DMU Maneuver Operations\nThe EOS Flight Dynamics System (EOS FDS) for Aqua is responsible for generating and\ndelivering a long predicted Aqua ephemeris that models the upcoming predicted IAM series to\nthe other constellation members. This occurs after the completion of the IAM series. The flight\ndynamics teams for each mission will use the predicted Aqua ephemeris as a baseline for\n\nmodeling their own IAM series in order to meet the along-track separation requirements. This is\ntrue for Aura as well; its yearly IAMs are synchronized with Aqua\xe2\x80\x99s. Both Aqua and Aura have\nsimilar lifetime simulations used to plan the IAM series, each modified according to the\nparticular satellite constraints.\nWhen producing the Aqua and Aura long term prediction ephemeris, all DMU maneuvers are\nperformed through a simple logic loop that maintains the ground track error within 0 to 10 km\nwhile maneuvering at the location that best maintains the frozen orbit parameters. Under\nnominal slewed operations, the location and date of the DMU maneuvers would never have an\nimpact to the MLT profile as all of the delta-v is directed along the velocity vector. In other\nwords, the predicted ephemeris is immune to differences between a predicted DMU maneuver\nschedule and the actual maneuver dates in regards to predicting the MLT profile for the year.\nThis benefit allows the remaining constellation members to accurately plan their own IAM series\nin order to meet the mission along-track separation requirements.\nProblems occur when using the current targeting logic used to generate the predicted Aura\nephemeris under no-slew DMU operations. The variability in actual versus predicted maneuver\ndates and locations could cause a violation of the +/- two second MLT prediction accuracy\nrequirement. The maneuver dates and locations when compared to the prediction will be\ndifferent due to a variety of circumstances: actual solar flux conditions compared to the Schatten\nMean Nominal solar flux model used in predictions will shift the maneuvers dates, movements\nof maneuvers for operational convenience (such as avoiding holidays, weekends, and inclement\nweather conditions), unexpected RMMs due to close approaches with debris objects, and\nmovement of the maneuver location due to TDRS and ground station contact scheduling. This\nvariability makes it difficult for the other constellation members to maintain a constant MLT\nseparation from Aura as the potential delta-i induced during each DMU maneuver will alter the\ntime rate of change of the right ascension. This will cause Aura to drift relative to the other\nconstellation members.\n4. Proposed Maneuver Schemes\nTo solve the challenges that come with no-slew DMU maneuvers for Aqua and Aura, an\nalteration to the current maneuver strategy is necessary. The first approach is to maintain the\ncurrent maneuver approach while introducing the no-slew concept. This scenario suffers from a\ncrucial complication; the amount of delta-i and delta-RAAN achieved each DMU maneuver\nbecomes uncertain. The variability in the argument of latitude necessary to maintain a frozen\norbit and the varying frequency of maneuvers required to maintain the operational ground track\ndue to changing atmospheric conditions leads to long term uncertainty in MLT predictions. This\nunpredictability complicates the other constellation members\xe2\x80\x99 ability to accurately plan their\nSpring IAM series to meet the MLT separation requirements. While MLT may be deleteriously\naffected, the nominal maneuver scheme does adequately maintain frozen orbit requirements over\nthe spacecraft lifetime.\nAn alternative maneuver approach attempts to compensate for the drawback of MLT uncertainty\nby limiting to maneuvers near the poles where there is insignificant net change to the inclination.\nWhile the effect to the inclination (or MLT drift rate) is reduced, maneuvering near the poles\n\ncauses an instantaneous change to the right ascension of the ascending node (MLT). At first, this\ninstantaneous change in RAAN is not detrimental to the MLT separation between Aura and the\nconstellation members; however, as more DMU maneuvers are performed to deal with\natmospheric drag, the change in RAAN can compound and become a significant factor. To\ncompensate for the changes in RAAN, one could modify this approach by performing the\nsubsequent DMU maneuver on the opposite side of the orbit when compared to the previous\nDMU maneuver (i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cmirror pole strategy\xe2\x80\x9d). Mirror pole maneuvers will cancel the achieved\ndelta-i and correct the instantaneous RAAN change resulting in little to no net change to the\nMLT rate and no net change to the MLT, thus allowing the constellation members the ability to\naccurately plan their Spring IAM series in order to maintain the required MLT separation. This\nmaneuver scheme, however, neglects to maintain the frozen orbit properties. Additionally, other\nconsiderations, such as the feasibility of performing DMU maneuvers over the North and South\npole, due to contact limitations, must be further explored.\nBoth the current maneuver strategy and the mirror pole strategy succeed in either minimizing\naffects to the frozen orbit requirements or the MLT while simultaneously increasing detrimental\neffects to the other. Long term drift to the frozen orbit parameters becomes increasingly difficult\nto correct over time, implying that short term corrections are needed. The MLT, important for\nscience and mission safety, can be reset each year but cannot be neglected when planning DMUs\nwithout affecting the Afternoon Constellation members during the yearly IAM series. In order to\nmaintain all mission requirements, a third maneuver scheme, which will be some combination of\nboth frozen orbit and MLT maintaining (mirror pole) maneuvers, is needed.\n\n5. Analyzing Maneuver Strategies which Minimize MLT Effects\nThe current strategy of maneuvering in the location that minimizes the impact to the frozen orbit\nproperties needs to be adjusted to incorporate the effects of out-of-plane delta-v induced from\nno-slew operations. The overall goal of the modified strategy should be to minimize the effects\non the MLT by controlling the delta-i achieved from each DMU in order to reduce the\nuncertainty in Aura\xe2\x80\x99s future MLT profile. Once the MLT can be maintained, further study of\nhow to balance the effects to MLT with those of a frozen orbit, can be considered.\nFrom the investigation of Eq. 1-6, maneuvering at the north or south pole (argument of latitude\nequal to 90 or 270 degrees, respectively) will achieve this goal as all of the out-of-plane delta-v\nwill go into delta-RAAN instead of delta-i. Placing the out-of-plane component into deltaRAAN will have no effect on the time rate of change of the right ascension as Eq. 7 is only a\nfunction of semi-major axis and inclination.\nTo see the effects on the orbital elements and MLT through various maneuver strategies, a\nreference scenario was generated that maintains the current maneuver ideology (maintaining the\nyaw slew and performing the maneuver in the location that maintains the frozen orbit properties).\nSeven different no-slew DMU scenarios were modeled: maneuvering at the location that best\nmaintains the frozen orbit properties (one scenario), maneuvering only at the north or south pole\n(two scenarios), maneuvering only at the ascending or descending node (two scenarios), and\nalternating maneuvers between the poles or between the nodes (two scenarios). Figures 2-7 show\n\nthe difference in the orbital elements and MLT when compared to the reference slewed DMU\nsimulation over a 10.5 month period between successive Spring IAM series. All DMU\nmaneuvers are modeled as finite maneuvers centered about their respective locations.\nThe first insight from Fig. 2 and 4 is the confirmation of the conclusion reached from studying\nLagrange\xe2\x80\x99s planetary equations of motion for nonconservative forces; maneuvering at the poles\nresults in all delta-RAAN while maneuvering at the nodes produces all delta-i. Further insight\ninto the problem is gained when studying Fig. 7. The initial concern that the accumulated delta-i\nachieved throughout the year from no-slew operations could violate the +/- two second MLT\nprediction requirements is confirmed. The two scenarios in which all DMUs are performed at\neither node deviate from +/- two seconds of the reference scenarios within 6 months. As shown\nin Tab. 3, the other five scenarios all maintain a MLT difference within +/- two seconds of the\nreference scenario. The three scenarios with maneuvers occurring at the poles provide the best\nresults, as expected. All of the MLT difference is due to the instantaneous plane change when\nmaneuvering at the poles. The mirror poles strategy provides the best results as the RAAN\nchange from the previous maneuver is canceled out. This canceling effect is evident in Fig. 4\nand 5 as the right ascension difference over the year roughly averages zero.\n\nTable 3. Mean local time difference after 10.5 months between the seven no-slew scenarios\nand the reference slewed DMU scenario.

The magnitude is one to two orders of\nmagnitude lower than maneuvers at the nodes.\n\nFigure 4. This figure shows the difference in right ascension between the seven no-slew\nscenarios and the reference slewed scenario. As expected, maneuvering at the poles\nproduces instantaneous RAAN change while the poles produce no RAAN change. The\nRAAN change present for the node cases is due to the achieved inclination change (evident\nin Fig. 2) affecting the MLT drift rate.\n\nFigure 5. The above figure provides a zoomed in view of the right ascension change. The\ninstantaneous RAAN changes for the polar strategies are more pronounced in this zoomed\nin view. In addition, the zero net change in RAAN is apparent for the mirror poles strategy.\n\nFigure 6. The MLT profiles for the seven strategies and reference scenario over a 10.5\nmonth period. The horizontal red lines highlight the mission requirements for Aura.\nClearly, the node strategies deviate from the reference scenario (pink) the most. The polar\nstrategies are almost indistinguishable from the reference scenario.\n\nFigure 7. This figure provides a quantitative comparison of the MLT difference between\nthe seven no-slew scenarios and the reference slewed scenario. The horizontal red lines\nmark the +/- two second prediction requirement. The node strategies violate the +/- two\nsecond prediction within seven months. The polar strategies provide the smallest MLT\ndifference, each within +/- one second.\n\nThe mirror nodes strategy also provides a scenario that passes the +/- two second MLT\nprediction requirement. Under the mirror nodes strategy, each maneuver produces a small\namount of inclination change that affects the time rate of change of the right ascension. By\nalternating maneuvers between the nodes, the achieved delta-i is essentially canceled out;\nhowever, the right ascension has time to drift between maneuvers before the inclination change\nhas been canceled. The \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d of this strategy is its reliance upon solar flux conditions.\nDuring solar minimum, the time between DMU maneuvers is larger and therefore the MLT has\nmore time to drift from the ideal before the inclination is returned to its ideal value during the\nsubsequent maneuver. During solar max DMU maneuvers occur more frequently, thus\nshortening the amount of time the inclination change affects the right ascension rate. For this\nanalysis, the simulation was run during solar max of solar cycle 24 (2013-2014) in which a DMU\nis predicted to occur about once a month [5]. This timing essentially represents a best case\nscenario for the mirror nodes strategy, which is already more than twice the frozen orbit strategy\nMLT error.\nThe frozen orbit maintenance strategy passes the +/- two second requirement as well. At first\nglance, this scenario seems like the best choice as it involves the least amount of change to the\ncurrent maneuvering strategy while maintaining the +/- two second requirement. The largest\nflaw with this scenario is its lack of predictability. The algorithm that selects the optimal\nmaneuver location based on frozen orbit maintenance just happens to select maneuver locations\nthat successfully maintains Aura\xe2\x80\x99s MLT. Historically, maneuvers have ranged between an\nargument of latitude of 140 and 360 degrees but have occurred outside of this range as well. The\nunpredictability in this strategy is especially evident in Fig. 5 as the amount of right ascension\nchange has no predictable pattern. It is possible that in order to maintain the frozen orbit\nthroughout a year the maneuver location will need to be near the nodes, which was shown to be\ndetrimental to the MLT prediction requirements. The unpredictable nature of this strategy is\nreason enough to discard it as predictability is an essential factor in constellation flying, and\nespecially important in future implementation on Aqua as the constellation anchor.\nIn summary, this year long simulation demonstrates that maneuvering at the poles provides the\nbest method for maintaining Aura\xe2\x80\x99s MLT profile as the out-of-plane energy is put into changing\nthe right ascension instead of the inclination. In order to take the benefits of this pole strategy to\nthe extremes, alternating DMU maneuvers between the poles provides virtually no change in\nMLT compared to the reference as the effects on the right ascension from a pair of maneuvers is\nessentially zero.\n5. Frozen Orbit Implications and Modification to the Mirror Pole Strategy\nUnder slewed DMU maneuver operations, the maneuver is performed in the location that best\nmaintains the frozen orbit properties. When switching to no-slew operations using the mirror\npoles strategies, the freedom to maneuver in the location that best maintains the frozen orbit\nproperty is lost. The analysis presented in Section 5 shows how MLT considerations now dictate\nthe maneuver location. Figures 8 and 9 show the impact to the frozen orbit properties (argument\nof perigee and eccentricity) over the course of a four year simulation. The horizontal red lines\n\nrepresent the mission requirements (argument of perigee = 90 +/- 20 degrees and eccentricity =\n0.0012 +/- 0.0004).\n\nFigure 8. The argument of perigee for the mirror poles strategy and the reference slewed\nscenario over a four year simulation. The reference scenario maintains a tight oscillation\naround 90 degrees as the maneuver location is selected to maintain this tight behavior. The\namplitude of the mirror poles strategy continues to compound over the four year\nsimulation.\n\nFigure 9. The eccentricity for the mirror poles strategy and reference slew scenario over a\nfour year simulation. The same behavior found in the argument of perigee plot is evident in\nthe eccentricity plot; the reference scenario maintains a tight oscillation about the ideal\nvalue (0.0012) while the amplitude for the mirror poles strategy continues to increase.\nClearly the frozen orbit parameters are maintained within their requirements; however, there is a\nnoticeable compounding effect. The 116 day period of coupled frozen orbit properties remains\nintact but the amplitude of oscillation continues to grow. There are three primary concerns with\n\nthis behavior: violation of mission requirements, detrimental effects to the science data, and\nimpact to mission safety. First, current lifetime estimates indicate that Aura has enough fuel to\nmaintain its MLT until 2022, and Aqua until 2020. Although changes in MLT can become more\napparent in the short term, the longer term frozen orbit effects could become problematic over\nthe lifetime of the mission. Additionally, the compounding effects within the first four years\ncould be enough to disturb the science data. By the end of the four year simulation, the\neccentricity extremes reach 0.0009 and 0.0014. This corresponds to a difference of\napproximately 3 km at apogee and perigee at the extreme eccentricities. A discussion with the\nscientists would need to occur to determine if these altitude variations are detrimental to science\ncollection. Global altitude variations due to geographic features can be more pronounced than\neffects from larger eccentricity amplitudes and therefore it is possible that this concern can be\nignored. Third, the impact of having the argument of perigee oscillate between 75 and 105\ndegrees has not been assessed in regard to mission safety; specifically, along-track separation at\nthe orbit plane intersection instead of at the equator.\nAt this point in the study, no-slew maneuvers were implemented operationally on Aura. Three\neight-second demonstration maneuvers were performed followed by six burns of varying sizes\nfrom 14.5 to 38.5 seconds. The operational no-slew maneuvers provided the opportunity to\ngather definitive data which was then used to hone the maneuver predictions. Based on the\noperational data, it was shown that the elimination of the slew reduced all pre-maneuver attitude\nthruster firings. Additionally, the maneuver thruster firing data has indicated that maneuvers\nlarger than 17.75 to 21.5 seconds are susceptible to post-maneuver firings. A finer threshold will\nbe determined as more data is collected, as well as increased accuracy predictions for all\nmaneuver sizes. Table 4 below provides the results of the nine no-slew DMUs used in this study.\nThe reduction in attitude errors, which further reduces the pre- and post-maneuver thruster\nfirings, increases the accuracy of the maneuver predictions.\nTable 4. Aura no-slew maneuver results.

Subsequent maneuvers\nused only no-slew maneuver data.\n\nFollowing the operational no-slew maneuvers, the lifetime simulations run in section 5 were\nfurther modified to include the operational no-slew thruster duty cycle and thrust scale factor\n(TSF) data. New maneuver scenarios were created and analyzed over a four year period. The\nreference scenario, which modeled all maneuvers as slewed and planned for frozen orbit\nmaintenance, was compared to four others: all mirror pole maneuvers, all frozen orbit\nmaneuvers, and two hybrid schemes, frozen orbit maneuvers with one mirror pole pair, or with\ntwo mirror pole pairs. The first two schemes bound the problem; all mirror pole pairs will have\nthe largest effect on the frozen orbit while all frozen orbit maneuvers will have the largest effect\non the MLT. The goal was to find the right balance in the hybrid maneuver scheme to maintain\nboth requirements.\nThe hybrid maneuver schemes were set up in the simulation to model mirror pole maneuvers, in\npairs, directly following the completion of the Spring IAM series. This minimizes the time that\nany small inclination change can propagate before the next IAM series. At some to-be\ndetermined point in the year, these schemes switch to frozen orbit maneuvers. Based on the\nsimulation which used the April 2013 Schatten Mean Nominal solar flux predictions, either one\nor two mirror pole maneuver pairs could be performed each year before the switch. The data\ncollected from the four year simulation is shown in the tables and plots that follow. Tables 5 and\n6 show the maximum difference in frozen orbit properties over the four year study. Figures 1014 plot the frozen orbit, argument of perigee vs. eccentricity over four years, with the graph\nlimits as the operational requirements defined in Tab 1. Figure 15 plots the eccentricity over four\nyears, while Fig. 16 shows the deviation in eccentricity from the reference slew scenario.\n\nTable 5.

The argument of perigee for the various maneuver strategies and reference slew\nscenario over a four year simulation. The all mirror pole maneuver strategy shows the\nmost eccentricity deviation, with the other maneuver schemes more tightly controlled. The\n\nspacecraft argument of perigee shows similar behavior over four years.\nFigure 16. The argument of perigee for the various maneuver strategies and reference slew\nscenario over a four year simulation, plotted as the absolute difference from the mission\nrequirement of .0012 (1.2E-3)\n\nBased on the tables and figures, one can see that the mirror pole strategy on its own causes\noscillation in the frozen orbit to grow over time. Over four years, performing all mirror pole pairs\nand performing two mirror maneuver pairs exhibit the most frozen orbit growthThe one mirror\npole maneuver pair maneuver strategy maintains the frozen orbit parameters within 30% over\nfour years. It would be helpful to continue this simulation further out in time as most of this\nsimulation occurred during the predicted solar minimum. Solar minimum greatly reduces the\nneed for DMU maneuvers and therefore reduces the effects of non-optimal maneuver locations\non the spacecraft orbit. Figures 15 and 16 may imply that the eccentricity growth for the all\nmirror pole maneuver strategy is bounded, but there is no analytical reason to believe that this\nwould be the case over a longer period of time.\nNext, the Mean Local Time is compared in Tab. 7 below for each maneuver scheme over one\nyear. The effects are limited to one year because the MLT is essentially reset each year during\nthe IAM series.\n\nTable 7. This table shows the maximum mean local time difference for each maneuver\nscheme in comparison to the nominal slewed maneuver scheme. The yearly mean local time\nrequirement is +/- 2 seconds.\nMLT Difference Compared to a Slewed Maneuver Strategy\nPlan\nMLT Difference (sec) over one year\nAll Mirror Pole\n0.20\nAll Frozen Orbit\n0.24\nOne Mirror Pole Pair\n0.03\nTwo Mirror Pole Pairs\n0.05\n\nFigure 17.

There is not a significant amount of degradation\nof the MLT prediction for either hybrid maneuver strategy.\n7. Conclusions\nModifications to the nominal DMU maneuver strategy are required in order to maintain the MLT\nprediction requirements under no-slew DMU operations. As shown, the maneuver location\n(argument of latitude) plays a key role in the effect on the orbital elements when introducing an\nout-of-plane delta-v component. DMU maneuvering at the poles produces pure delta-RAAN\nwhile maneuvering at the nodes produces pure delta-i. Slight variations in inclination will alter\nthe time rate of change of the right ascension, thus altering the evolution and predictability of the\nMLT profile throughout the year. The potential for error in the MLT profile makes it difficult for\nother constellation members to plan their own IAM series in order to maintain along-track\nseparation requirements. To prevent this unwanted alteration to the inclination, performing\nmaneuvers alternating between the poles (instead of the location necessary to maintain frozen\norbit properties) ensures zero inclination change from each maneuver with a zero net RAAN\nchange after a pair of maneuvers.\nWhile this strategy is successful in maintaining the MLT profiles and along-track separation\nrequirements, further research determined that the long term effects on the frozen orbit properties\nwere significant enough to warrant a modified mirror pole maneuver strategy. It was found that\nperforming maneuvers at the poles for a given period after the Spring IAM series then switching\nthe maneuver location to the argument of latitude that best maintains the frozen orbit properties\n\ncan be used to maintain both MLT and the frozen obit. Furthermore, the study finds that the\nMLT can be maintain by relatively few mirror pole pairs, with an insignificant difference\nbetween performing one or two pairs per year. Because the MLT can be reset each year during\nthe IAM series, it would be more prudent to perform as many frozen orbit maneuvers as possible\nwithout broaching the +/-2 second MLT requirement; therefore, based on the current\nenvironmental predictions, performing one mirror pole pair per year will be sufficient to\nmaintain both requirements.\nFurther study of the effects of solar minimum and maximum on this maneuver strategy will be\nimportant as the current solar cycle decreases in the solar minimum. Solar minimum will\nincrease time between DMUs which in turn will increase the MLT deviation as the RAAN rate\nerrors produced from an initial mirrored pole maneuver execution propagate over a longer period\nof time. Future work should also look at the effects of Risk Mitigation Maneuvers (RMMs) on\nboth the frozen orbit and MLT. RMMs are most often performed in a location chosen to reduce\ncurrent risk, generally from debris, and therefore could be detrimental to mission requirements\nunder the no-slew strategy. Current analysis points to a small effect considering relatively few\nRMMs are executed each year. In addition, a longer term lifetime simulation, covering the entire\nremaining mission is warranted before implementing the no-slew hybrid maneuver strategy on\nAqua.\n8.
