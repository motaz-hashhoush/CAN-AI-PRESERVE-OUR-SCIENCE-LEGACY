More sets of data are collected today from earth and sky than there is time or resources available to carefully analyze them. Some problems either don't have fast algorithms to solve them or have solutions that must be found among millions of options, a situation akin to finding a needle in a haystack. But all hope is not lost: advances in technology and the Internet have empowered the general public to participate in the scientific process via individual computational resources and brain cognition, which isn't matched by any machine. Citizen scientists are volunteers who perform scientific work by making observations, collecting and disseminating data, making measurements, and analyzing or interpreting data without necessarily having any scientific training. In so doing, individuals from all over the world can contribute to science in ways that wouldn't have been otherwise possible.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "17", "submissionId": 20160006556, "issue": "4", "issn": "1521-9615", "publisher": "IEEE/AIP", "id": "c289bce7bc144acebaf7a06f88196120", "publicationName": "IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering Magazine", "publicationDate": "2015-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
