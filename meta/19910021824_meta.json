The two new techniques represent the coupling without using explicit equality constraints, thus avoiding the above diffuculties and also reducing computational cost of the procedure. The old and new formulations are presented in detail and illustrated by an example of a structural optimization. A generic version of the improved algorithm is also developed for applications to multidisciplinary systems not limited to structures.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910021824, "id": "15f01721e7a44f689f795919b9e386ab", "publicationDate": "1991-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910021824.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910021824/downloads/19910021824.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910021824/downloads/19910021824.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910021824/downloads/19910021824.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
