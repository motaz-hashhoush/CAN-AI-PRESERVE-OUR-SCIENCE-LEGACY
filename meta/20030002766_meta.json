The silver ions serve as an effective bactericide/deodorizer. Tap water passes through filtering element of silver that has been chemically plated onto activated carbon. The silver inhibits bacterial growth and the activated carbon removes objectionable tastes and odors caused by addition of chlorine and other chemicals in municipal water supply. The three models available are a kitchen unit, a \"Tourister\" unit for portable use while traveling and a refrigerator unit that attaches to the ice cube water line. A filter will treat 5,000 to 10,000 gallons of water.", "title": "Water Filter", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030002766, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030002766, "id": "58166a7174c845aa98c92575a5a05d49", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1982", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030002766.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030002766/downloads/20030002766.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030002766/downloads/20030002766.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030002766/downloads/20030002766.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
