The task has been to identify and study nine sites, each of which is near a variety of representative geologic units. The choice of sites is independent of future decisions as to whether the rovers will be manned or unmanned, except that unmanned rover traverses may be shorter and more restricted. North and south polar locations, the Grand canyon that exposes layered terrain, two stream channels, two volcanic centers, and two upland sites are under consideration.", "title": "Mars landing sites", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T09:22:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850025580, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Masursky, H."}, "organization": {"name": "Geological Survey", "location": "Flagstaff, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "dd40f9df5d5a4e5682f14cbd2461ee6c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850025580, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850025580, "id": "79af4a92c0d84177b25bdefe0d956dda", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst.
