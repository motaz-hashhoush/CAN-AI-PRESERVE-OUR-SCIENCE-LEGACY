This high resolution telescope will be capable of operating from Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm) through the near infrared; support five different scientific instruments at its focal plane (two cameras, two spectrographs, and one photometer); and by periodic on-orbit servicing and ground refurbishment be able to operate with technologically current scientific instruments for at least 15 years.
