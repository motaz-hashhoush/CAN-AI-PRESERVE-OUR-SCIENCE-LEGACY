b'BENEFICIAL USES OF SPACE\nBy H. L. Bloom, General Electric Space Division, Valley Forge,\nPennsylvania\nABSTRACT\nPaper summarizes Bioprocessing - related results of recently completed three-year, three\nphase study, "Identification of Beneficial Uses of Space", for NASA-MSFC under Contract NAS828179.\nF i r s t phase of study elicited over 100 ideas for Space Processing. Of the elicited ideas, more\nthan 20% involved processing of biologicals, or related medical and life sciences applications. Among\nthese w e r e High Purity Separation of Isoenzymes, and Development of Biorhythms applications data.\nSecond phase of study focussed on program planning for four products, for which required experimentation and testing resulted in definition of nearly 70 s e r i e s of tests in ground-based laboratories, sounding rockets, etc., and Space Shuttle. Development schedules established timing and\ninterrelationships of decisions involved in carrying these products to the point of production.\nFinal phase of study determined potential profitability of the four products. Resources needed\nto achieve full scale production included u s e of Shuttle for transportation, for which a cost apportionment model was developed. R&D resources for the four products totalled $46, 000,000 with Isoenzymes requiring the smallest expenditure, $4,000,000. A computerized profitability model\n(INVEST) was used to determine the measures of profitability of each product. Isoenzymes exhibited\nrelative commercial attractiveness (e. g., up to 30% return on investment, $12, 000,000 present\nvalue, and breakeven at 7 y e a r s from f i r s t major investment).\nConclusions a r e that, while specific Space Processing Applications s o far identified may not\nbe those that a r e ultimate "payoff" from space, results build confidence that there will be a payoff.\n\nAt the General Electric Space Division we have recently completed a 3 year, three-phase study\n"Identification of Beneficial Uses of Space1\' (Figure 1)under contract NAS8-2817 9 from NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center.\nThis effort was aimed at defining and exercising a n~ethodologyfor:\ne\n\nInitially, identifying a community of potential Space Processing Users - specific organizations represented by specific individuals, who a r e involved in solving specific\nearth-based technological problems which can be related to specific knowledge and capabilities obtainable in spaceflight\n\ne\n\nSecondly, involving such Users in defining the plans of specific technical steps and\nadministrative processes required in carrying out such projects\n\ne\n\nFinally, continuing the Users involvement in contributing to realistic assessments of (1)\nthe resources required to c a r r y out the planned projects; (2) the returns which may\nbe realized from such a venture; and (3) i t s resultant profitability.\n\nWhere such steps indicate a good business potential, entrepreneurial u s e r s will eventually\nfollow.\n\nWith the enthusiastic support of Messrs. R. Spencer and K. Taylor, MSFC\'s Contracting Off i c e r \' s Representatives, and with the cooperation of over 400 Key Individuals from 80 organizations\nparticipating in We Study, we have developed a successful methodology, which includes survey and\nUser contact methods, planned presentations and dialogs, a s well a s documents and formats for\neliciting and maintaining the interest, support and aid of potential Space Processing Users. This\nmethodology also includes operational analyses for comparison and selection of key technical alternatives, and the integration of that data with management planning data. Furthermore, our\nmethodology provides several key commercial business analysis and evaluation techniques, adapted\nfrom ground processing business methods, for assessing market data, estimating R&D and production needs, and comprehensively analyzing the business worth of products.\nThe primary results of the Study have evolved from application of the aforementioned methods\nand techniques to the above-noted potential User organizations, and to their ideas for potential space\nprocesses, products, and services. Those results a r e briefly summarized in this paper, organized\naccording to the three Phases of the Study.\nPHASE I OF THE STUDY\nAs noted in Figure 1, Phase I has concentrated on User Identification. The development of\npeer-level, personal contacts; trial and e r r o r evolution of an introductory, educational ideastimulating kick-off presentation; establishment of an overall dialog plan; and promotion of mutually\nsupportive analyses have been the major methodologies in t h i s Phase.\nAs a result of these efforts, our search for potential space-developed products, processes and/\no r services initially uncovered over 100 ideas. The complete list of these ideas, together with the\ngoals and objectives sought by the potential U s e r s is given in Reference 1.\nA sampling of those ideas that a r e of possible interest to this Bioprocessing Colloquiun~a r e\nshown in Figure 2. Observation reveals the wide spectrum of User interests. Typical products\nf o r which U s e r s anticipated possible improvements due to the so-called "zero gravity" of spaceflight\ninclude such biologicals a s high specificity isoenzymes and high purity insecticides; and such medical\nelectronics materials a s large germanium crystals and low-defect silicon crystals. U s e r s also felt\nthat processes such a s thinner, defect-free coating of implantable sensors, and "enzyme engineering"\nusing some adaptation of affinity chromatography might also accrue from weightlessness and lack\nof convection. Nor was research neglected - bone growth in "zero gravity" was viewed a s an a r e a\nof possible investigation for treatment of major fractures and for bone surgery, while the potential\nsynergistic effects of "zero gravitytt and space radiation on the mutation of micro-organisms (including those utilized in the dairy industry and in producing antibiotics) were of interest to several\nparticipants.\nWhile almost all of the 100 ideas in this initial identification were considered a s valid User\nneeds, consultation with technology experts, analyses in various disciplines (both aerospace and nonaerospace), and various degrees of engineering judgement enabled u s to extract 12 ideas with high\npotential for eventual implementation. These surviving ideas a r e shown in Figure 3, with details of\nthe specific a i m s sought by the U s e r s and the specific applicability of Space Processing. Twelve\nother ideas exhibited sufficient promise to warrant further evaluation at a later date. The remaining ideas were excluded from further study, due to conflict with Study Guidelines, overlapping objectives, analytical or empirical indications of scientific invalidity, etc.\n\nFurther Phase I effort on the 1 2 best ideas developed tentative experimental and operational alternatives for providing the required information, environments, and/or facilities found likely t o .\nmeet the Users aims. This activity established early indications of the "mix" of ground and space\noperations involved in precursor experimentation and eventual commercial Space Processing.\nAmong the significant results of Phase I, shown in Figure 4, the early estimates of the $1\nbillion to $2 billion value of the 1 2 current ideas aroused considerable interest, but also raised\nquestions a s to the details of necessary pre-production research and development, and, perhaps even\nmore important, a s to legal, financial and administrative arrangements. Typical of these latter\nquestions a r e those listed in Figure 5.\nA major conclusion of this phase, therefore, was that further commitments by potential U s e r s\nwould require more information on ground rules and mechanisms which would govern the legal, financial and technical relationships between NASA and commercial industry, and which would, therefore, interact with key technical and administrative decisions and their timing.\nPHASE I1 OF THE STUDY\nThese requirements helped formulate objectives for the second phase of study, in which we aimed\nto obtain in-depth technical planning data for typical products from Phase I, as well a s program\nscheduling and decision information for management planning. Details of this phase of the study a r e\nfound in Reference 2.\nDue to timing and funding limitations, this phase of study was limited to the four products listed\nin Figure 6 , and carried out with the support of the listed organizations, who aided the analyses of\nthose products in Phase I.\nFor the four products,with the four participating User organizations, we evaluated nearly 130\nalternative processing approaches prior to selecting those offering the best chances for successful\ndevelopment. With the Users, we then defined specific experiments and tests necessary to such development. This r e s e a r c h and development program required a broad spectrum of facilities, both\nground-based and spaceborne. Figure 7 lists the required facilities and number of test runs.\nThe large number of experiment runs in ground laboratories is indicative of the state-of-thea r t in the listed areas, and acknowledges t h a t a comprehensive ground-based program is a necessary\npart of the typical space processing program.\nThe program leading t o high specificity separations of isoenzymes by large pore gel electrophoresis and/or isoelectric focussing calls for the largest number of experiment runs, although later\nwork shows that it is the least costly program. For example, much of the testing, especially the\ncentrifuge tests, centers around the effects of spaceflight operations on the large pore gels. It i~\nimportant to understand the susceptibility of the gels, with and without separated specimens, to prelaunch handling, launch loads, and r e-entry loads. Centrifuge data will answer many of the questions\ninvolved, a t very low cost.\nThe details of the experiments and tests listed here were fitted into development timelines,\nwhich included all of the research, engineering, ground development tests, and flight testing (including Shuttle flights) to achieve a production capability in the early 1980\'s. These details included\npreliminary experiment and test protocols, estimates of equipment needs, a s well a s dates and\nduration. The resulting sequence and timing of technical tasks together with the indicated need for\ncommitment of facilities, equipment and manpower enabled the Users, working in the Study Team,\nto formulate the flow of decisions necessary to implement each development program,\n\nFigure 8 presents a typical decision flow for the Isoenzymes development program. Both technical and management decisions a r e shown: Their interrelationships a r e readily visible, a s a r e\nkey nodes in the flow of decisions. Major alternatives a r e indicated in the table, estimates (by the\nUsers) a s t the probability of each alternative\'are given, a s a r e the preferred (by the User) alo\nternative.\nIn summary, Phase II, produced a wealth of technical (processing approaches, experiment and\ntest definitions, facility and equipment needs) and management (milestones, decisions, probabilities)\nresults, Figure 9. However, many of the questions of Figure 5 were still being asked. Furthermore, while Phase I1 assembled data reflecting specific plannirg for evolving from concepts to experiments, to initiating commercial operations, a key element was not addressed in those phases..\nthe business potential of Space Processing.\n\n.\n\n1\nPHASE 1 1 OF THE STUDY\n\nCan Space Processing be a profitable business venture? This question was the problem for Phase\n111. We continued working with the same four products and essentially the same Users to a r r i v e a t\nthe answers.\n1\nThe essence of our task in Phase 1 1 (reported in Reference 3) was to acquire sufficient technical\nand economic information to c a r r y out the financial analysis pictured in Figure 10.\n\nAn examination of that figure reveals the scope of analyses we have carried out. For example,\nblocks listed a s Wnit Price", "Total Market" and "Market Share" spell out the need for a comprehensive market analysis. "Unit Mafiufacturing Cost", and \'\'Annual Plant and Equipment" reveal a\nrequirement for thorough understanding of the commercial manufacturing flow and productivity (both\nground-and space-based). "R&D Expense" calls for details of the precursor experimentation and\ndevelopment testing, with major emphasis on the timing and costs of facilities and equipment.\n1\nTypically, Figure 1 lists the major equipments needed to c a r r y out the Isoenzyme Separation\nexperiments and tests, briefly summarizes their development status, and notes quantities needed\nat various points in the development schedule.\n\nA key part of our R&D analysis was the assessment of Shuttle/Spacelab utilization costs. This\nrequired construction of a cost allocation model.\nOur cost model, given in Reference 3, provides for recovery of all operating costs, allocates\ncosts on the basis of Shuttle resources utilized, and provides incentives (or dis-incentives) to encourage (or discourage) use of various resources. Using our recommended utilization rates, we\nshow, in Figure 12, the cost r a t e s by which a payload User may be allocated his fair share of a\ntypical $10.7 million flight cost.\nSimilar depth and scope of analysis have been carried out for the production phase of each of the\n4 products under study. Using life cycle market demands estimated for each product, in-depth conceptual design of equipments and payloads, comprehensive "throughput" analyses of each step in the\nproduction process, with the aid of the User participants, we generated the required data for the final\nprofitability analyses.\nThe plots on Figure 13, for the Isoenzyme business venture represent the data generated for all\nfour products. A detailed treatment is given in Reference 3.\n\nCase A includes the User funding the total R&D program, $3.8M;\nnominal forecasted market\nand market share; conservative unit cost of-producing product; nominal selling price. Space production of high specificity Isoenzymes was not an attractive venture under these conditions.\nFor Case B, Mr. K. Taylor suggested that, since basic processes would have broader application than the individual products under study, it could be likely that the basic process feasibility\nwould be proved under government funding. User, in Case B therefore, would only pick up those\nR&D costs that specifically provide prototype/pilot plant capability. Under these conditions, NASA\n(as the agent of the government) provides early R&D funds, and the Isoenzyme processing appears\nattractive.\n\nIn summary (Figure 14) for Phase 1 1 our development planning data includes detailed formats\n1,\ndescribing and timing all Work Elements. Each element of work is backed by documentation of the\nhuman, facility, and materials resources required to perform that work, and the cost of such r e sources.\nIn Phase 1 1 Users historical data and prognostications provided market forecasts, and the r e 1,\nsulting needs defined production levels, which helped to establish size and performance requirements\nfor processing equipment.\nWe identified resources required of the Space Program, such a s the 85-600 kilowatt hours of\nenergy required per flight for Space Processing R&D on the four products studied. Figure 14 summarizes such typical resources, and the costs of those resources for the R&D effort.\nFinally, Figure 14 shows that Space Processing of Isoenzymes tends to be an attractive business\nventure, once the feasibility of large pore gel electrophoresis in space has been demonstrated. However, the long period before breakeven inhibits the attractiveness of Tungsten processing and Transparent Oxides. Reducing the unit manufacturing cost by 20% (rated a possibility, since several\nlogical approaches for reducing on-orbit energy costs, have recently been brought to our attention\nby the Study C . 0. R. ) could reverse those conditions.\nSUMMARY OF LESSONS LEARNED\n\nIt is appropriate, here, to review what we have learned k o m all phases of the Study.\nTypical specific Lessons Learned from Phase I a r e briefly depicted in Figure 15.\ne\nThe successful identification of Beneficial U s e s of Space in Phase I, was based on gaining the\ninterest of potential Space Applications U s e r s through dialogs.\n\ne\nConsiderable Study Team/User mutual education occurred during this Phase through the interchange of Aerospace/Non-Aeros.>ace and Commercial/~overnmentvendor data.\no\nSince dialogs sometimes did not evoke immediate potential U s e r s ideas, because of the novelty\nof the space environment to non- Aerospace organizations, we broadened and deepened our initial\nbriefing data in order to lessen this effect.\n\nFurthermore, the development of User concepts for Space Processing appears to be a time dependent process, and future studies should allow 6 months o r more for the process of generating\nideas.\ne\n\nPhase 11, which carried the study from "identification" to "planning" also taught U S some lessons.\nFigure 16 shows two conclusions for Phase I1 carried over from the earlier phase: one on User\neducation and another on Legal/Financial issues.\nPhase I1 results verify that a mutually supportive effort, progressing toward specific concepts,\nmaintains two-way communications between the aerospace community and non-aerospace industry.\nThe wide spectrum of current technical unknowns evolving from the limited amount of available data, and the unpredictability of the state-of-the-art in the 1980\'s, a r e reflected in a necessarily broad scope of requirements for experiments and tests.\n\ne\n\nPreliminary schedules of development programs a r e "comfortable" and can accommodate moderate redirection, where necessary.\n\ne\n\nAs important as the results of Phase III a r e the lessons we have learned, Figure 17. Some\nsimply verify o r reiterate lessons from the preceding Phases (e. g., the value of dialogs, the r e quirem ent for blending aerospace/non-aer ospace methods rather than imposing one on the other,\netc. ). Others a r e either new, o r have become more apparent at this stage of effort, and, thus, bear\nsome discussion.\nWe note two key problems in Figure 1 7 for instance - that of acquiring a Space Processing Program User constituency, and a related need for a policy to determine the tariff for use of space facilities. In the dialogs with the commercial industry community, we have found that the prospect of\nderiving new or improved products through Space research and development does not supplant, but\nrather competes with prospects of current, low cost, often historically successful ground-based r e search programs. Thus, the technical competitiveness of Space Processing will have to be matched\nwith economic competitiveness, and the combination used a s a marketing "tool" to acquire the necessary User constituency.\n\n@\n\nDuring the profitability analysis in this Study, two key space operations functions were found t o\nexert profound effects on the production costs of the space products - (1) energy (primarily for heating and melting process steps), and (2) the launch of production facilities for each production run.\nAs a result, one of our conclusions is that\n\n@\n\na major effort must be undertaken to develop a low-cost, high power, in-orbit energy source\nif space products which require high temperature heating and melting a r e to be profitable.\naddition,\na long t e r m , on-orbit automated, o r semi-automated production facility will be required,\n\nIn\n\n1\n\nif repetitive production runs a r e t o be performed without incurring the prohibitive expense of r e peatedly launching the necessary processing equipment.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nStudy for Identification of Beneficial Uses of Space (Phase I) Final Report, Contract NAS8-28179,\nGE Document No. 73SD4259, December 10, 1972 and April 23, 1973.\n\n2.\n\nStudy for Identification of Beneficial Uses of Space (Phase 11) Final Report, Contract NAS8-28179,\nGE Document No. 73SD4281, November 1, 1973.\n\n3,\n\nStudy for Identification of Beneficial U s e s of Space (Phase III) Final Report, Contract NAS8-28179,\nGE Document No. 75SD4-281,\n2 PO\n\nUSES\n\nI\n\n.\n.\n\nREQUIREMENTS EVALUATION\n~ C C H N ~ C * ~\nEVGLUTIQN\nDEVELOPMENT\nPUNNING\n\nI\n\nBUSINESS PLANNING\nMARKET SURVEY\nDEVELDP:wlENT COST\nMETHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURESFORFUTURE\nPRODUCT5\ne CWPARISON\n\n.\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nFLIGHT\nSY5TEM\nRESOURCES\n\nJ\n\nFigure 1.- Relationships of B S s t u d y phases I, 11, and 111.\nU\n\n0\n\nCOATING OF IMPLANTABLE SENSORS\n\n.\n\nHIGH QUALITY SILICON CRYSTALS FOR\nMEDICAL APPLICATIONS\n\nPROSTHETIC MAlER I A L FOR BONE\nGROWTH\n\ne\n\nVIRAL INSECTlCl DE MANUFACTURE\n\ne\n\nAFFlNl N CHROMATOGRAPHY\n\ne\n\nLYOPHItlZATlON\n\n0\n\nTHIN FILMS FOR DIALYSIS\n\no\n\nBLOOD ANALYSIS SERVICE\n\n0\n\ne\n\nHIGH DUCTILITY TUNGSTEN X-RAY\nTARGETS\n\no\n\nDEVELOPMENT DATA FOR PHONOCARDIOLOGY\n\no\n\nIMPROVEMENTS I N DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\ne\n\nBONE GROWTH I N ZERO "G"\n\n0\n\nMUTATION AND GROWTH OF MICROORGAN ISMS\n\nUTILIZATION OF BIORHYTHMS\n\na\n\nFigure 2.-\n\nSEPARATION OF ISNNZYMES\n\na\n\nLARGE GERMANIUM CRYSTALS FOR\nGAMMA RAY CAMERA\n\nTHERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF LIQUIDS\n\n0\n\n0\n\ne\n\nNEW ANTIBIOTICS\n\ne\n\nCULTURING OF BIOLOGICALS\n\nUser i d e a s of t y p i c a l b e n e f i c i a l u s e s of space f o r bioprocessing.\n\nI\n\nHIGH PURITY VACCINES\n\nI\n\nHlGH SPECIFICITY VlRAL INSECTICIDES\n\nELECTROPHORES I S\nRECTROPHORESIS FREE R W\nO 1\nFREE LITHOGRAPHY\n\nSINGLE CRYSTAL AND/OR EUTECTIC HIGH\nTEMPERATURE TURBl NE BUCKETS\n\nLARGE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND/OR, CONVECTI ONLESS SOLID1 FlCATlON\n\nH l G H PURITY, DUCTILE TUNGSTEN X-RAY\nTARGETS\n\nLEVITATION MELTING AND SUPERCOOLING\n\nH l G H PURITY RADIOISOTOPES\n\nPARTICLE MANIPULATION BY SMALL\nFORCES\n\nLARGE, UNIFORM SILICON SINGLE CRYSTALS\n\nLARGE CRYSTAL GROWTH AND/OR CONVECTl ONLESS SOL1 D l FlCATlON\n\nUNIFORM GARNET SINGLE CRYSTAL FILMS\n\nCONVECTIONLESS EPITAXIAL CRYSTAL\nGROWTH\n\nTRANS PARENT METAL OX1 DES\n\nLEVlTATl ON MELTING AND UNIFORM\nSUPERCOOLING\nELECTROPHORESIS LARGE PORE GEL) OR\nISOELECTRIC FOCUSSING\n\nIHIGH SPECIFICITY ISOENZYMES\nI-\n\nF i g u r e 3.-\n\nTwelve i d e a s w i t h high p o t e n t i a l .\n\nDEVELOPED NON-AEROSPACE USER COMMUNI-\n\n.\n\nI\n\nB R W D INDUSTRY\nPARTICIPATION\n80 ORGANIZATIONS\n14 BASIC INDUSTRtES\n\n12 HIGH-WTENTLAL\n\nPRWUCTS\nPROCESSES\n\n.\n\nCOMhERCUL INDUSTRY\n\nADMINISTRATIVE\n\nF i g u r e 4.-\n\nT y p i c a l q u e s t i o n s from phase I.\n\nHOW W l L L NASA HANDLE M Y PROPRIETARY DATA (OR EQUIPMENT)?\nWHAT RIGHTS WOULD NASA RA\n\xe2\x82\xacN\nlI\n\nON M Y DATA (OR PATENTS.
