The Martian atmosphere, density, and iron abundance are compared with those of earth, and it is noted that the planet was probably formed in less than 100,000 years. Stages in Martian differentiation are described together with the  atmospheric composition, condensation and dust clouds, and surface winds. The surface is shown to have a wide diversity of geological landforms resulting from a variety of processes, including meteoroid bombardment, volcanic and tectonic activity, sapping, the action of running water, and wind action. Described landforms include impact craters, volcanic plains and domes, shield volcanoes, sinuous channels and gullies apparently formed by running water, and the enormous canyon system. Mechanisms for climatic change are considered, and questions are posed regarding the possibility of life on Mars.", "title": "Mars", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T04:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750058411, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pollack, J.
