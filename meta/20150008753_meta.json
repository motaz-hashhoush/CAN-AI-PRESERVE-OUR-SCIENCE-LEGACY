By abstracting away data-source specific details, Splunk unifies arbitrary data formats into one uniform system. This not only reduces the time and effort for retrieving relevant data, but it also increases operational visibility by allowing a spacecraft team to correlate data across many different sources. Splunk's scalable architecture coupled with its graphing modules also provide a solid toolset for generating data visualizations and building real-time applications such as browser-based telemetry displays.", "title": "Revamping Spacecraft Operational Intelligence", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-05-26T15:37:43.6070000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150008753, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hwang, Victor"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "c7d35f9aa90b446b8ac8cc7ed977e472"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "meetings": [{"country": "Sweden", "submissionId": 20150008753, "endDate": "2012-06-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ac5a8e056a4d498b8613251d449c3687", "id": "66963c94a0484558a000f8c884c4e72f"}], "name": "SpaceOps 2012 Conference", "location": "Stockholm", "id": "ac5a8e056a4d498b8613251d449c3687", "startDate": "2012-06-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 20150008753, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/44972", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150008753, "id": "72fcf597591d421daacf0d278ee51ab7", "publicationDate": "2012-06-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
