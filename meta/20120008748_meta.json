One of the primary goals is to extract propellants from the regolith such as oxygen and hydrogen which could then be used for in-space transportation. In addition, the space mining system can be used for various construction tasks that can benefit human and robotic exploration as well as scientific investigations based on the exposed topography. The National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Lunabotics Mining Competition is a university-level competition designed to engage and retain students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). NASA will directly benefit from the competition by encouraging the development of innovative lunar excavation concepts from universities which may result in clever ideas and solutions which could be applied to an actual lunar excavation device or payload. The challenge is for students to design and build a remote controlled or autonomous excavator, called a lunabot, that can collect and deposit a minimum of 10 kilograms of lunar simulant within 15 minutes. The complexities of the challenge include the abrasive characteristics of the lunar simulant, the weight and size limitations of the lunabot, and the ability to control the lunabot from a remote control center or operate autonomously. This paper will present an update of the results and lessons learned during the first and second annual Lunabotics Mining Competitions held in May 2010 and May 2011. It will also preview the 2012 competition with a review of the revised rules. In 2010,22 United States (US) universities competed, and in May 2011 the competition was opened to international participation. In 2011, 36 teams actually competed from 26 USA states and 4 foreign countries (India, Bangladesh, Colombia and Canada). This combined total directly inspired an estimated 653 university students. In 2012 more students and the public will be engaged via internet broadcasting and social networking media. The various designs will be cataloged and categorized to provide information to future Lunabotics mining robot designers and competitors. It is also expected to be of value for actual future space missions, as knowledge is gained from testing many innovative prototypes in simulated lunar regolith.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120008748, "endDate": "2012-04-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Civil Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "b32b1796890641599124353d5291e51c", "id": "3364dc2b1c7945849e0489641d22f65d"}], "name": "American Society of Civil Engineers, Earth & Space 2012 Conference", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "b32b1796890641599124353d5291e51c", "startDate": "2012-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120008748, "id": "8b735783994b42f996712a47c66090fa", "publicationDate": "2012-04-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120008748.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120008748/downloads/20120008748.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120008748/downloads/20120008748.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120008748/downloads/20120008748.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
