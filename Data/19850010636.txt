Laboratory endeavors are devoted primarily to\nthe programs and projects of NASA; it is within the NASA-sponsored research\nprogram that these National Rc^earch Council Research Associateships are\noffered at JPL.\nSince the beginning of Its association with NASA in 1958, JPL has been\nthe leading center in the United States for unmanned lunar and planetary\nexploration. Spaceflight missions for which the Laboratory has been responsible include the Ranger series of hard-landed lunar spacecraft, the Surveyor\nsoft-landed lunar series, the Mariner series of planetary flybys and orbiters,\nand the Viking Orbiter and Lander missions to Mars. Among projects now\nunder way are the Voyager Uranus Interstellar Mission flyby and the Galileo\nJupiter orbiter-probe mission. In addition, JPL conducted the Seasat project\nfor ocean observations.\nThe content of the JPL research program generally reflects this longstanding interest in earth and planetary sciences, along with an involvemt nt\nin the study of solar irradiance, fields and particles of interplanetary space,\n\ni\t\n"\t\n\nand observations beyond the solar system. During the past few years, the\nEarth sciences program has expanded into the areas of physical and biological\noceanography, weather, climate, mid upper-atmospheric chemistry, as well\nas research associated with applications to problems of national interest such\nas Earth resources and energy systems. Fields of active research include\n\nplanetary atmospheres, planetology, comets, asteroids, interplanetary fields\nand particles, optical and radio astronomy, high-energy astrophysics and\nsolar physics, and studies in atmospheric and ocean processes. The range of\nactivity in these fields covers theoretical study, laboratory experiments,\n\na\nS^\ni^\n\nground-based observations, instrument development, flight (aircraft, balloon,\n\nand spacecraft) experiments, and analysis of experimental data. Activities\nthat are not totally space oriented include automation, fuel processing and\ncombustion, systems analysiE, photovoltaics, image and information proc-\n\nessing, biomedical instrumentation, and materials research.\nIn addition to its flight-project resonsibilities and research and development\nprograms, JPL also operates the NASA Deep Space Network for communi-\n\ncating with and controlling spacecraft from earth. Antennas, 85 and 210 ft\nin diameter, are located at stations around the earth and connected by ground\ncommunications to the JPL Space Flight Operations Facility. All planetary\niii\n\nDLA\':" 1,100 FfLR\'7D\n\ngi\n\nSy\n\nr\n\nI\n\n^r\n\nand interplanetary spaceflight missions conducted by NASA utilize this\nsystem.\nThe Laboratory also conducts programs in Energy and Technology Applications. These include (1) dispersed solar-energy-conversion systems, using\nphotovoltaics and solar-thermal technology and considering many aspects of\napplications and utility system interactions; (2) coal mining, processing, and\nconversion; and (3) the development of electric and hybrid vehicle systems.\nA variety of other problems in (ransportaton systems, energy conversion and\nutilization technology, environmental technology, and medical technology\nare being addressed in conjunction with various agencies.\nThe Laboratory is located seven miles north of the Caltech campus in the\nfoothills above Pasadena, California. It employs approximately 4,000 people;\nof these,\t some\t 1,200\t are\t professional\t scientists and\t engineers.\t Close\nrelationships are maintained in many areas of research with faculty and staff\nat nearby universities, in addition to Caltech itself. These institutions include\nthe University of Southern California, University of California at Los Angeles,\nCalifornia State University at Los Angeles, and University of California at\nSan Diego, among others.\n\niv\n\n> 4\n\nis\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4 a.\t\n\n.\'\n\ny\n\n,\n\n0`It\n\nAlw\n\nt\n\n41\n\nq\n\nContents\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION\t\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH\nEarth and Space Sciences Division\t\nSystems Division\t\nTelecommunications Science and Engineering Division\t\nControl and Energy Conversion Division \t\nApplied Mechanics Division\t\nInformation Systems Division\t\nObservational Systems Division\t\n\n9\n31\n32\n34\n42\n45\n49\n53\n\nINDEX OF RESEARCH ADVISERS\t\ni\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n1\ni\n\n1\n\nfe\ni\n\ni\n\nx..\nv\nl\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2fir.\nxk\n\nIntroduction\nGeneral Information\nThe National Research Council (NRC) conducts the Resident Research\nAssociateship Programs in cooperation with a number of sponsoring Federal\nlaboratories and research organizations approved by the NRC for participation.\nIn the programs, a national competition is conducted by the NRC to recommend\nand make awards to outstanding scientists and engineers at the recent\npostdoctoral and experienced senior levels for tenure as guest investigators\nat the participating laboratories. These programs have been conducted with\na number of Federal agencies since 1954.\nThe objectives of the program are\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to provide postdoctoral scientists and engineers of unusual promise and\nability opportunities for research on problems, largely of their own choice,\nthat are compatible with the research interests of the sponsoring laboratories\nand\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 to contribute thereby to the overall research effort of the Federal\n\nlaboratories.\n\n0\t\n\nfThese programs are intended to be analogous to fellowships, associateships,\n\nand similar temporary programs at the doctoral level in universities and other\norganizations. They are neither intended to be, nor to compete with, permanent\nprofessional career positions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An NRC Resident Research Associate is a guest investigator, not an\nemployee of the National Research Council or of the laboratory, and there\n\n;!\n\nis no obligation to either organization during or after completion of tenure.\ni\t\n\nFor recent doctoral graduates, the program provides an opportunity for\n\nconcentrated research in association with selected members of the permanent\nprofessional laboratory staff, often as a climax to formal career preparation.\nFor established scientists and engineers, the program affords an opportunity\n\nfor research without the inter.vptions and distracting assignments of permanent\nt\t\n\ncareer positions. The participating laboratories and centers receive a stimulus\n\nto their research programs by the presence of bright, highly motivated recent\ndoctoral graduates and senior investigators with established records of research\n\nproductivity. New ideas, techniques, and approaches to problems contribute\nto the overall research climate of the laboratories. Indirectly, the pre^ram\n\nrii\n\nalso makes available to the broader scientific and engineering communities\n\n1\n\n#\nof\n\nc^\n\nthe excellent and often unique research facilities that exist in the government\'s\nlaboratories.\nApplications for awards will be received b y the Associateship Programs\noffice of the NRC and will be evaluated on a competitive basis by special\nNRC panels of scientists and engineers. For the 1984 program year, it is\nanticipated that approximately 1,000 applications will be received for the\nnearly 250 new awards to be made in the NRC Research Associateship\nPrograms.\nDescribed in this booklet are areas of research in which Research\nAssocialeships may be awarded at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Each\napplicant is responsible for formulating a specific research plan on a problem\nthat is related to the current research interests of the laboratory in which the\napplicant wishes to do research.\nApplicants whose research interests appear to be related to one or more of\nthe opportunities described in this booklet are advised to communicate directly\nwith the research adivsers who are designated for those areas of research.\nResearch advisers can provide more specific information on current research\nprograms and available technical facilities. Further inquiries concerning\nresearch opportunities and advisers may be directed to the NRC-NASA\nLaboratory Program Representative:\nDr. Harry Ashkenas\nJet Propulsion Laboratory - 183-601\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91109\nTelephone: (213) 354-2140\nEach applicant\'s proposed plan of research must be approved by one of\nthe research advisers listed herein and endorsed by the program committee\nof the JPL to be eligible for an award. The endorsement affirms that the\nproposed research problem is compatible with the laboratory\'s interest and\nthat adequate programmatic support will be available if an award is offered.\nA written response regarding each applicant\'s proposed research problem\nmust be received from the laboratory by the Associateship Programs office\nbefore an applicant will be reviewed by the NRC evaluation panels. The\nCenter\'s action on the research proposal, together with a copy of the adviser\'s\ncomments, will be provided directly to the applicant by the NRC Program\nRepresentative at the JPL. It must also be determined that the applicant is\nacceptable for resident status at a NASA Center.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 All applicants should note that endorsement by a research adviser and/\nor laboratory, while an essential component of the application process, must\nnot be assumed to imply or guarantee an award by the NRC. Applicants are\nformally recommended for awards uuly after open, national competition, in\nwhich special NRC-appointed panels rank candidates on the basis of quality\nalone. Final ranking in order of quality and the recommendation of applicants\nfor awards are the exclusive prerogatives of these panels, and notification\nonly by the NRC of an applicant s status to the competition is authoritative. \t\n\ni\n\nI\n\np\n\n6 a\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2 4-\n\n.J\n\nPr`\n\ndA,\n\n.01\n\nEligibility of Applicants\nCitizenship\n;k\n\nResearch opportunities in basic science and applied science and technology\ndescribed in this booklet are open to all citizens of the United States.\na Non-U.S. citizens may submit research proposals in basic science areas\nonly and must have full command of the English language. Non-U.S.\nnationals who become Associates must have valid visas throughout tenure.\nOnly Exchange Visitor and Immigrant Visas are acceptable to the NRC. If\nan awardee chooses to apply for an Exchange Visitor Visa, the sponsorship\nmust be under the NRC. If one chooses to apply for a U.S. Immigrant Visa,\nthe NRC will not be involved in the matter,\nEducation and Experience\nAwardees must hold the Ph.D., Sc.D., or other earned research doctoral\ndegree recognized in U,S. academic circles as equivalent to the Ph.D. or\n\nmust present acceptable evidence of having completed all the formal academic\nrequirements for one of these degrees before tenure may be initiated.\nApplicants must have demonstrated superior ability for creative research. An\napplicant\'s training and research experience may be in any appropriate\ndiscipline or combination of disciplines required for the proposed research.\n\nt\n\nr.\n\nPrior Affiliation with the Laboratory\nA primary objective of the Associateship Programs is to provide a\nmechanism for new ideas and new sources of stimulation to be brought to\nthe sponsoring laboratory. Thus, persons with substantial recent prior\naffiliation with a specific laboratory may not be eligible to apply for an\nAssociateship at that laboratory,\nSubstantial recent prior affiliation includes direct employment relationships\neither with the laboratory or with a contractor whose work is performed at\nthe laboratory. A long-term consulting relationship with the laboratory usually\nmakes the applicant ineligible. Research contracts with universities that\nprovide support for graduate students and faculty performing research on die\ncampus are not ordinarily considered disqualifying.\n\n.1\n\nn\n\nReapplication\t\nPersons who have previously held an NRC Research Associateship may\napply for another i vard only if a period of at least two years will have\t\n\n?y\n^u\n\n3\nt\n-^\t\n\nk\n\nFk"\n\n\'ix\t\n\nk\n\nt\nN\n\nelapsed between termination of the first award and the proposed tenure of it\nsecond award. Persons who have previously applied for an NRC Associateship,\nbut who were not recommended for an award by the NRC panels, may\nreapply after one year. Candidates who were recommended for an award by\nthe NRC panels, but who were not offered an award because of funding or\nother limitations, may reapply at any time without a mandatory waiting\nperiod.\n\nConsideration\nQualified applicants will receive consideration without regard to race,\ncreed, color, age, sex, or national origin.\nConditions of the Award\nRegular Research Associateships will be awarded to persons who have\nheld the doctorate less than five years at the time of application and will be\nmade initially for one year.\nSenior Research Associateships are awarded only to investigators who\nhave held the doctorate five years or more at the time of application. Senior\napplicants should have research experience that has resulted in significant\ncontributions and recognition as established investigators in their specialized\nfields. Awards to senior Associates will generally be for one year; however,\nawards for shorter periods will be considered.\nUnder certain conditions, extensions will be granted to allow Associates\nto bring their research programs to a reasonable stage of completion. An\nextension must not be assumed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 No commitment on the part of an Associate, the sponsoring laboratory, \t\nor the NRC with regard to later employment is implied or should be inferred\nby the offer or acceptance of an award.\n\nI\n\nThese Research Associateships are tenable only at the approved, participating laboratories listed to this booklet. No period of the Associateship\ntenure may be spent in residence at another laboratory or institution. Associates\nwill have the status of visiting scientists or engineers in the laboratory but\nwill be subject to the general working conditions at the laboratory. The Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, which provides the funds to support this program,\nwill furnish all necessary support services, facilities, and equipment for the\napproved research program of each Associate.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Although applications for NRC-NASA Research Associateships will be\naccepted throughout the year, they will be evaluated in competition only\nduring certain periods. Three competitive reviews will be held in 1984.\nCompleted applications that are postmarked not later than January 15, April\n\n4\t\n\n}\t\n\n\'^\t\n\n,\n\n-a\n\niii\n\n..,.1--\n\n41\ni\ne\nl1\n15, and August 15, and received by the NRC not Inver than January 25, April\n25, and August 25, will be reviewed for announcement of awards in March,\nJuly, and November, respectively. The NRC must be advised by the JPL\nthat the proposed research has been approved; otherwise, the NPt will\nassume that the proposed research I s not of sufficient current interest to\nNASA or that support facilities cannot be made available.\nAssociateship awards will be made by the NRC. The date on which tenure\nof an Associutcship award may begin is negotiated on an individual basis.\nTenure should normally begin within six months of the award; however, the\nstarting date may be delayed by mutual agreement of JPL, the Associate,\nand the NRC. Sufficient time must be allowed between the offer of an award\nand the beginning of tenure to enable the NRC and JPL to complete all\nC necessary administrative procedures. The starting date cannot be later than\n12 months from the date of the original award. If this condition cannot be\nmet, a new application, including a newly approved plan of research, must\nbe submitted to the NRC and will be judged without prejudice in the next\ncompetition.\n\nG\n\nf\na\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While every effort has been made by the participating Center or laboratory\nto provide Research Opportunities of ample scope and relevance, the\nappearance of any Research Opportunity in this booklet does not guarantee\nthat it will be available at the time Associatcship awards are offered. Changes\nand/or deletions may occur following the publication of this booklet, and all\nopportunities are subject to final review and approval by the laboratory and\nthe NRC prior to the awarding of tenure.\n\nStipend\nA Research Associate will receive a stipend from the NRC while carrying\nout the research proposed as part of the application procedure. The current\nstipend for a regular Research Associate is at tha annual rate of $24,500.\nThe base is subject to adjustments from time to time in accordance with\ngeneral national guidelines pertaining to scientists and engineer. An appropriately higher stipend will be offered to senior Associates.\nFollowing current salary practices in certain professional fields that arc\n{ experiencing a short supply of new doctoral graduates, a stipend supplement\nmay be allotted by the NRC to awardees in those disciplines. For the 1984\nprogram year, stipend supplements of up to $5,000 may be added to the\nbasic stipend for regular awardees ho lding recognized doctoral degrees in\nengineering, computer science, and c..nical space-biomedical science.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Applicants are cautioned against entering into any agreement or understanding with individual Research Advisers or other laboratory personnel\nconcerning additional funding or other remuneration for work as an Associate.\nStipends for Research Associates are limited to the amounts and by the\n\nv\nv\n\nN\n\nconditions set forth above, and any other arrangement, formal or infornml,\nbetween an applicant and laboratory personnel for additional monies or other\nconsiderations is strictly prohibited by the NRC.\n\n.1\n\nCommitment\nAssociates must devote their full-time effort to ilia approved research\nprogram and must be in residence at the sponsoring laboratory during the\nentire period of the Associateship. No additional monetary aid or other\nremuneration may be accepted from another appointment, fellowship, or\nsimilar grant, except for sabbatical leave, during the period of the Associateship.\n\nTaxes and Insurance\nAll Associates are, in effect, self-employed, ,\',t, arrangements for payment\nof income taxes are the responsibility of the individual Associate. An\nappropriate amount, estimated to approximate the tax liability of foreign\nnationals, will be withheld by the NRC from stipends of non-U.S, Associates\non Exchange Visitor Visas. Details will be provided at the time of the award.\nJob-related injury or death will be covered by insurance (workmen\'scompensation type). A group health insurance program Is required for\nAssociates and optional for dependents.\n,\nRelocation and Travel\n\nA suitable relocation reimbursement will be determined for each awardee.\nDetails will be provided at the time of the award. Funds will also be made\navailable for limited professional travel during tenure, provided such travel\nis recommended in advance by an Associate\'s research adviser at JPL and\napproved by the NRC.\nPublication\nSince an Associate\'s later scientific and technical career will be judged by\nothers, publication in the accepted open technical literature is highly encouraged. Publications should include a statement indicating that the research\nwas conducted while the author held an NRC Research Associateship.\nSummary of the Application Procedure\nFor further details on the application procedure, refer to the Instructions that\n\naccompany the application packet. \t\n\n4\n\n6\ni3p\n\nP^\n\n0\n\nib! 34-\n\nA6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Associateship Programs office of the NRC will receive all applications and supporting documents and conduct the competitive evaluation of\napplications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2Detailed information on application procedures, all necessary forms,\nand a list of the supporting documents required are available on request from\nthe\nAsswiatcship Programs (Jil 608)\nNational Research Council\n2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W\nWashington, D,C. 20418\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Applicatic , materials from previous competitions must not be used,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Submit the following to the Associateship Programs office:\nSigned Application form\nOffice Card\nResearch Proposal (one copy with original signature on\neach page)\n\nApproval of Research Form (one set)\nPrevious and Current Research form\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The above application materials must be postmarked no Inter than January\n15, 1984, April 15, 1984, and August 15, 1984, and must be received in the\nAssociateship Programs office no later than January 25, April 25, and August\n25, respectively.\nHave the following sent directly to the Associateship Programs office:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOffic i al transcripts of all graduate and undergraduate credits (not required\n\nfor senior applicants)\nFour Reference Reports from the respondents listed on the Application.\nOnly official Reference Report forms may be used by regular applicants.\nLetters of reference will be accepted for senior applicants.

First, tests of relativistic theories of gravity are being performed\nby fitting a variety of astrometrical data types to a computer model of solarsystem orbital dynamics. In particular, we are currently solving for PPN\nparameters, the Nordtvedt effect, and for a time variation of G, as well as\ncertain important Newtonian parameters such as planet gravity fields, asteroid\nmasses, etc. Second, a search for a cosmic background of gravitational\nradiation is being performed by looking for effects in Doppler tracking of\nspacecraft and for secular perturbations in two-body orbits. We are also\nengaged in a related theoretical study of gravitational-radiation-dominated\ncosmologies. Finally, we are generally interested in new ideas for future\nrelativity experiments, both in space and in the laboratory, and are actively\nstudying several of these.\nReferences\nJ.D.

The\nrecognition of the biota in providing global homeostatic control faetnr, can\nbe attributed to biological reactions that characteristically allow for extremely\nhigh chemical fluxes and quite often are masked by what appears to be a\nvery modest net synthesis on it globate scale.

Marzwell 44,40.10.14\nVarious high-energy laser systems have been developed for commercial\nresearch and defense applications. Atmospheric transmission and propagation\nproblems have attenuated and reduced the quality of the laser beam and\nlimited its application. To overcome this limitation, research has been initiated\nto understand how various laser wavelengths are being impacted with\nhumidity, crosswind, turbulence, slew rate, aperture, and range. Methods to\ntune the laser wavelength and optimize the beam quality inside the resonator\nand the outgoing beam as it propagates through the atmosphere are being\n\ninvestigated. Emphasis is being placed on new and tunable laser sources and\n\nmtehods of active control of the optical systems to optimize in real time the\noptical wave fronts in the presence of random distributions. The simplest\n\nactive optical systems are those controlling focus and tilt; they range in\ncomplexity from controlling a mirror in two degrees of freedom up to systems\nemploying segmented or deformable mirrors that may possess more than a\nhundred degrees of freedom. The purp ose of this research is (1) to control\nthe outgoing wave systems for maximizing the power density of a laser beam\non a target and (2) to enhance the properties of received wave systems for\nmaximization of the angular resolving power of a telescope or an array of\nsensors viewing a distant object through a turbulent atmosphere.\nCatalytic Processing of Hydrocarbons and Synthesis Gas\nG.E. Voecks 44.40.10.15\nCatalytic processes used by industry employ heterogeneous catalyst systems\nthat have changed little in the past 15 years. The catalyst being the heart of\n\nthese processes dictates the design of the plant, which then must compensate\nfor catalyst limitations in activity and bring the plant efficiency to as high a\n\nlevel as possible. However, these catalyst systems are often heat-transfer\nlimited and therefore suffer in performance because of the use of conventional\ncatalyst supports. In the work that has been conducted at JPI, in the Fuels\n\nConversion Group, a novel approach to supporting cata ysts has been\ninvestigated. Based on experimental evidence in exothermic and endothermic\nreactions and on modeling efforts recently initiated, heat-transfer limitations\non catalysts can be reduced through the use of novel catalyst supports. This\nimpacts the catalyst type, formulation, activity, and specificity that can be\napplied to conventional and unconventional catalytic processes.

Landel\t\n\nThe large-strain or finite deformation behavior of noncrystalizing elastomers\nis still a subject of considerable controversy. Both continuum and statistical\nmechanical (molecular) theories of behavior have been proposed and there\nare at least two competing approaches in each of these types of theory. To\nchoose between competing theories as well as to enhance the further\ndevelopment of both approaches, studies are needed on carefully controlled\nnetworks prepared from a family of monomer systems with a systematic\nchange in side-chain length. Moreover, the viscoelastic response of these\n\nnetworks must be excmined under pure biaxial loads or strains.\nThe studies will be carried out with the unique JPL bianial stress relaxometer\n\nusing specially made gum stocks that have already been synthesized.\nReferences\n\nK.

These activities include planning for Space Shuttle experiments as well as ground-based research programs in the field of glass, The\nground-based effo,- tieing pursued in glass science fall into three categories:\n(1) nucleation and crystallization of glasses, (2) gas bubbles in glassmelts,\nand (3) gel-prepared glasses. The properties and behavior of silicate, borate,\nand fluoride glasses are being investigated with the special emphasis of\nproviding the background information required for the interpretation of\nmicrogravity experiments. The program is primarily experimental in nature,\nbut mathematical modeling of glass processing and theoretical exposition of\nprocesses occurring in glasses are also being considered.\nNon-Newtonlan Fluids\nS.T.J. Peal; 44.40.04.03\nDissolved polymeric additives are under study because of their ability to\nprevent a liquid from being dispersed into a fine mist by wind shear. One\napplication for such a modified fluid is in aircraft safety. A jet fuel so\nmodified would not form a mist in a crash, and hence the potential hazard\nfrom fire in a crash would be lessened.\nThe polymers are of a very high molecular weight and are used at\nconcentrations of 0.1% to 0.5%, The non-Newtonian behavior of such dilute\npolymer solutions is being investigated in order to ascertain the mechanism\nof the antimisting behavior. Previous work has been concentrated on\nelongational flow using novel JPL-developed apparatus. Future studies will\nextend these results and investigate more complex systems (e.g., those which\ncan be caused to gel by shear flow), as well as amplify and modify current\nmolecular and continuum mechanical theories of the flow of non-Newtonian\nfluids.\n\nr\n\nRiferenres\n\nS.T.J.

Landel 44.40.04.05\nEngineering properties (e.g., creep, stiffness, durability) of glassy-like\nmaterials such as plastics, structural adhesives, or polymer matrix composites\ndepend strongly on history, because glasses are not in a state of thermodynamic\nequilibrium. Thus to predict behavior for the duration of long-life missions\n(10-30 yr), it is essential to apply a combined thwrctical and experimental\napproach to predict both rates of changes of properties and how these rates\nmay be affected by concurrent chemical degratation reactions.\nFor the macroscopic descrip0on of the glassy state, PVT studies are being\ncarried out as a function of thermal and mechanical load history. Studies on\nthe effect of time-dependent volume changes on physical properties include\na number of mechanical property (e.g., dynamic modulus, stress relaxation,\nPoisson\'s ratio) and spectroscopic (e.g., FPIR, ESR, fluorescence) measurements. The overall aim of these studies is to develop, based on molecular\nparameters, a comprehensive semiempirical predictive description of the\nbehavior of polymeric glasses.\n\ni,\n\nMultiphase Polymer Systems for Advanced Composite Materials\nS.D.
