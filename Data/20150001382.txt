An automated storm\n\n25\n\ntracking method is used to identify storm \xe2\x80\x9cclusters\xe2\x80\x9d and total lightning activity from\n\n26\n\nthree different lightning detection systems over Oklahoma, northern Alabama and\n\n27\n\nWashington, D.C. On average and for different employed thresholds, the clusters that\n\n28\n\nencompass at least one LJ (LJ1) last longer, relate to higher Maximum Expected Size of\n\n29\n\nHail, Vertical Integrated Liquid and lightning flash rates (area-normalized) than the\n\n30\n\nclusters that did not exhibit any LJ (LJ0). The respective mean values for LJ1 (LJ0)\n\n31\n\nclusters are 80 min (35 min), 14 mm (8 mm), 25 kg m-2 (18 kg m-2) and 0.05 flash min-1\n\n32\n\nkm-2 (0.01 flash min-1 km-2). Furthermore, the LJ1 clusters are also characterized by\n\n33\n\nslower decaying autocorrelation functions, a result that implies a less "random" behavior\n\n34\n\nin the temporal flash rate evolution. In addition, the temporal occurrence of the last LJ\n\n35\n\nprovides an estimate of the time remaining to the storm\xe2\x80\x99s dissipation. Depending of the\n\n36\n\nLJ strength (i.e., varying thresholds), these values typically range between 20-60 min,\n\n37\n\nwith stronger jumps indicating more time until storm decay. This study\xe2\x80\x99s results support\n\n38\n\nthe hypothesis that the LJ is a proxy for the storm\xe2\x80\x99s kinematic and microphysical state\n\n39\n\nrather than a coincidental value.\n\n40\n\n1. Introduction\n\n41\n\nThe advent of ground-based lightning detection networks in recent decades has\n\n42\n\nmade real-time retrieval of total lightning activity (cloud-to-ground, CG and the intra2 of 45\n\n43\n\ncloud, IC) available in both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Although there are\n\n44\n\nuncertainties in the details (Takahashi 1978; Saunders 1993), it is known that\n\n45\n\nrebounding collisions between graupel and ice crystals in the presence of super-cooled\n\n46\n\nwater is the primary process for thunderstorm electrification (MacGorman and\n\n47\n\nMorgenstern 1998; Saunders et al. 2006; Emersic and Saunders 2010). Several studies\n\n48\n\nhave documented a temporal co-variability between updraft mass flux, precipitation ice\n\n49\n\nmass and overall storm depth with the respective total lightning activity (e.g., Goodman\n\n50\n\net al. 1988; Carey and Rutledge 2000; Chronis et al. 2007; Deierling and Petersen 2008;\n\n51\n\nBruning and MacGorman 2013). Hence, it would be reasonable to suggest that an abrupt\n\n52\n\ntemporal change of the order of a few minutes in the total lightning activity is\n\n53\n\nconsidered as a severe weather indicator (\xe2\x80\x9cLightning Jump", LJ, see Schultz et al. 2009;\n\n54\n\n2011). Studies by Williams et al. (1999), Gatlin and Goodman (2010), Carey et al.\n\n55\n\n(2009), Schultz et. al. (2009; 2011) and Rudlosky and Fuelberg (2013) document that\n\n56\n\nstatistics such as lead time, probability of detection and false alarm ratio could be\n\n57\n\nimproved based on the use of total lightning as a metric for storm intensity. Nonetheless,\n\n58\n\nthese methods can be hindered by problems related to uncertainties in severe weather\n\n59\n\nobservations at the surface (Trapp et al. 2006; Keene et al. 2008; Schultz et al. 2011).\n\n60\n\nThis study puts forward an original comparison between the convective characteristics\n\n61\n\nof storms that did or did not exhibit a LJ throughout their lifetime. This evaluation relies\n\n62\n\non radar-derived and lightning properties.\n\n63\n\n2. Data and Methods\n3 of 45\n\n64\n\n2.1 Storm Tracking and Clustering\n\n65\n\nThe storm identification and tracking have been performed in real-time utilizing\n\n66\n\nthe Warning Decision Support System Integrated Information tracking system (WDSS-\n\n67\n\nII, Lakshmanan et al. 2007). A storm \xe2\x80\x9ccluster\xe2\x80\x9d is automatically identified by the\n\n68\n\nreflectivity across the -10\xc2\xb0C isothermal layer, following a merger of individual WSR-\n\n69\n\n88D radars.\n\n70\n\nemployed to identify the storm clusters (Lakshmanan et al. 2009; Kolodziej Hobson et\n\n71\n\nal. 2012; Cintineo et al. 2014). To complete the storm identification, the algorithm\n\n72\n\nsearches for local reflectivity (Z) maxima where Z > 20 dBZ, then incrementally grows\n\n73\n\nthe area until it is at least 200 km2. The storm cluster is then matched with a separately\n\n74\n\nidentified cluster at the next time step (for our analysis, a 1-min time step was used)\n\n75\n\nusing a cost function, where longer-lived cells are given preference in the case of storm\n\n76\n\nmergers.\n\nA combination of watershed segmentation and k-means clustering is\n\n77\n\nEach storm (hereinafter cluster) is described by a geolocated polygon (i.e.\n\n78\n\nfootprint). The cluster\xe2\x80\x99s lifespan is determined as the total time a cluster was identified\n\n79\n\nand tracked by WDSS-II (Lakshmanan and Smith 2009). The Maximum Vertical\n\n80\n\nIntegrated Liquid (VIL, Greene and Clark 1972) and the Maximum Expected Size of\n\n81\n\nHail (MESH, Witt et al. 1998; Cintineo et al. 2012) are retrieved for each cluster for the\n\n82\n\nduration of its lifetime. Both VIL and MESH have been used as radar-derived intensity\n\n83\n\nmetrics for storm properties such as liquid precipitation, updraft strength and hail growth\n\n84\n\n(Amburn and Wolf 1996; Witt et al. 1998). As with any proxy, there are caveats that\n4 of 45\n\n85\n\nreflect the imperfect representations of severe weather potential and emanate from\n\n86\n\nparameters unrelated to the storm dynamics (e.g. distance from the radar, tilted updrafts,\n\n87\n\nstorm speed etc., Stumpf et al. 2004). To mitigate these effects as much as possible, all\n\n88\n\navailable radars in the area are used to retrieve these proxies. Five radars over each of\n\n89\n\nthe three locations are employed, namely, KFDR, KTLX, KVNX, KINX, KSRX for\n\n90\n\nOklahoma, KHTX, KGWX, KBMX, KDHX, KFFC for north Alabama and KLWX,\n\n91\n\nKDOX,\n\n92\n\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/nexradinv/map.jsp). The data for the present study extends\n\n93\n\nfrom 1 April 2013 through 14 August 2013.\n\nKAKQ,\n\nKCCX,\n\nKDIX\n\nfor\n\nDC\n\n(radar\n\nacronyms\n\nfrom\n\n94\n\n2.2 Total Lightning Activity and the Lightning Jump Algorithm\n\n95\n\nThis study employs three total lightning detection networks: 1) the Lightning\n\n96\n\nMapping Array (LMA) networks located in central/SW Oklahoma (MacGorman et al.\n\n97\n\n2008), North Alabama (Goodman et al. 2005), and Washington D.C (Krehbiel 2008) 2)\n\n98\n\nthe Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN, Liu and Heckman 2010) and 3)\n\n99\n\nthe National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN, Cummins et al. 1995,2005,\n\n100\n\nCummins and Murphy 2009).\n\n101\n\nThe LMA networks detect the very high frequency (VHF) radiation emitted\n\n102\n\nduring the elemental processes that compose a lightning discharge (e.g. the initial\n\n103\n\nbreakdown, leader propagation and other K-processes, Uman 1987) with a location\n\n104\n\naccuracy measured in tens of meters and with a time resolution of 80-100 \xce\xbcs (Thomas et\n\n105\n\nal. 2004). The LMA detects both IC and CG flashes although the distinction can be\n5 of 45\n\n106\n\ndubious due to limitations in range. The location accuracy is also range-dependent,\n\n107\n\nhowever it is relatively constant between ~150 km radius from the respective center\n\n108\n\n(Thomas et al. 2004; Koshak et al. 2004). The following analysis relies on the total\n\n109\n\nlightning flashes occurring within ~120 km of the respective LMA center (Thomas et al.\n\n110\n\n2003). Lightning flashes are retrieved from the LMAs via grouping at least 10 detected\n\n111\n\nVHF radiation sources, using time and space constraints (3 km and 150 ms) between the\n\n112\n\nadjoining points (McCaul et al. 2008). Only flashes that begin within the storm cluster\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n113\n\nfootprint are counted towards the total flash rate. No classification between CG and IC\n\n114\n\nflashes is performed using LMA data.\n\n115\n\nThe ENTLN sensors operate over a wide frequency range, spanning from 1 Hz to\n\n116\n\n12 MHz. According to Liu and Heckman (2011), electric field waveforms are used in\n\n117\n\nlocating as well as classifying the IC and CG flashes. Multiple strokes (or individual\n\n118\n\ncloud events) are clustered into a single flash if they are within 700 ms and 10 km of the\n\n119\n\nfirst detected stroke. A flash that contains at least one return stroke is classified as a CG\n\n120\n\nflash, otherwise it is classified as an IC flash.\n\n121\n\nSince the late 1980s, the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN,\n\n122\n\nCummins et al. 1995; 1998; 2006) has served as the source for many CG lightning-\n\n123\n\nrelated studies over the US. The network consists of 113 sensors that combine the\n\n124\n\nadvantages of direction finding and time-of-arrival techniques. The NLDN CG detection\n\n125\n\nefficiency ranges between 90-95% over the mid latitude continental US, with a median\n\n126\n\nlocation error better than 500 m (Cummins and Murphy 2009; Rudlosky and Fuelberg\n6 of 45\n\n127\n\n2010). Although the NLDN is designed to primarily detect CG flashes, it has been\n\n128\n\nrecently reported that IC flashes are also detected depending on the restrictions applied\n\n129\n\nto the processed waveforms (peak-to-zero rise time, Murphy and Nag, 2014).\n\n130\n\nThe present study employs the total flash activity (IC+CG) for all lightning\n\n131\n\ndetection systems. Rudlosky and Fuelberg (2013) use a similar methodology for\n\n132\n\ncompiling lightning and radar data. Both NLDN and ENTLN have national (US)\n\n133\n\ncoverage. Nevertheless, for this analysis the respective total lightning activity is\n\n134\n\ncomputed only for the clusters that are identified over a radius around where the\n\n135\n\noptimum LMA operation is ensured. Further detailed comparison (e.g., relative location\n\n136\n\naccuracy and detection efficiency) between the lightning detection systems lies outside\n\n137\n\nthe scope of this paper. However, their employment is considered as a preliminary\n\n138\n\nattempt to demonstrate results pertaining to the LJ properties from lightning detection\n\n139\n\nnetworks of different technical specifications (e.g., detection efficiency).\n\n140\n\nThe 1-min flash rate is computed by adding all the flashes occurring within the\n\n141\n\nfootprint of the identified cluster. The LJ is objectively identified by Schultz et al. (2009;\n\n142\n\n2011). This technique uses 14 min of the cluster\xe2\x80\x99s most recent flash rate history. Twelve\n\n143\n\nof the 14 minutes are considered to calculate the minimum jump threshold that must be\n\n144\n\nexceeded for a LJ to occur. The remaining two minutes are used to determine whether\n\n145\n\nthe current rate of change in the total flash rate exceeds the LJ threshold. As outlined in\n\n146\n\nSchultz et al. (2009; 2011), the algorithm is a 5-step process. These steps are as follows:\n\n147\n\n1) The total flash rate (f min-1) from the 14 minute period is binned into two minute\n7 of 45\n\n148\n\nsegments and the total flash rate is averaged (Eqn. 1)\n(1)\n\n149\n150\n\n2) The rate of change of the total flash rate (DFRDT, f min-2) is calculated by subtracting\n\n151\n\nconsecutive bins from each other (Eqn. 2)\n\n152\n\n(2)\n\n153\n\nThis results in six DFRDT values (f min-2) 3) The five earliest DFRDT values in time\n\n154\n\nare used to calculate the standard deviation (\xef\x81\xb3) of the population 4) If DFRDT > \xce\xb1 * \xef\x81\xb3\n\n155\n\nand the flash rate is in greater than a given flash rate threshold (FRT) then a LJ has\n\n156\n\noccurred. Note that -\xce\xb1- represents a multiplicative factor (i.e. dimensionless) and has no\n\n157\n\nrelation to the standard deviation (\xef\x81\xb3). In the original studies by Schultz et al. (2009;\n\n158\n\n2011) \xce\xb1 and FRT were set to 2.0 and 10 f m-1. Also note that \xce\xb1 is dimensionless (i.e., f\n\n159\n\nmin-2 /f min-2). Here we compute the LJ based on a variable \xce\xb1 (0.5 - 4, step of 0.5) and\n\n160\n\nFRT (5-25 f m-1, step of 5 f m-1). The latter is employed in order to define the LJ relative\n\n161\n\nstrength. For example, a weaker LJ1 would have \xce\xb1=1.0 and FRT=10 f m-1 while a\n\n162\n\nstronger LJ1 would be considered as \xce\xb1=2.0 and a FRT=15 f m-1 5) This process is\n\n163\n\nrepeated every two minutes as new total lightning flash rates are collected until the\n\n164\n\nstorm dissipates.\n\n165\n\nWe note that the above implemented time-window within which the LJ is\n\n166\n\ncalculated is based on empirical observations of the growth and decay on the convective\n\n167\n\ntime scale (<10-20 minutes). Had we allowed for longer periods (e.g. 40-60 minutes)\n8 of 45\n\n168\n\ninto the thunderstorm\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime we would likely have missed the occurrence of the first\n\n169\n\nLJ and potentially severe weather occurrence. This is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve empirically tested this\n\n170\n\nalgorithm with over 700 storms in multiple storm environments to help understand the\n\n171\n\nvariability of the algorithm (Schultz et al. 2011). The choice of the 2*\xef\x81\xb3 (i.e. \xce\xb1=2) in\n\n172\n\nSchultz et al. (2011) is simply a benchmark to which this study is not tied to.\n\n173\n\n3. Analysis and Discussion\n\n174\n\n3.1 Data and Quality control\n\n175\n\nAs WDSS-II tracks clusters independently of the respective total lightning\n\n176\n\nactivity, the number of the identified LJ0 and LJ1 clusters is considerably different. For\n\n177\n\ninstance more than 2,000 clusters are classified as LJ0 at \xce\xb1=2.0 f m-2 and FRT=10 f m-1\n\n178\n\nwhereas less than 200 are classified as LJ1 for the same \xce\xb1 and FRT values. To ensure a\n\n179\n\ncomparable sample size and improve the representativeness of the data, we report on the\n\n180\n\nLJ0 and LJ1 clusters that exhibit sustained total lightning activity for more than 95%\n\n181\n\nduring their lifespan (e.g., if a cluster is tracked for 100 minutes, the cluster must exhibit\n\n182\n\ntotal lightning activity greater than zero for at least 95 minutes). This quality constraint\n\n183\n\n(QC1) may classify a slightly different number of clusters depending on the employed\n\n184\n\nlightning detection system. An additional quality constraint (QC2) is applied to the\n\n185\n\nclusters that start or end at a flash rate that is notably higher than zero (set to >10 f m-1).\n\n186\n\nTypically, these cases represent merging or splitting clusters or clusters that\n\n187\n\nentered/exited the effective radius of the LMA with high flash rates. QC2 also takes\n\n188\n\ncare of potential problems with MESH/VIL repetitiveness due to distance from the\n9 of 45\n\n189\n\nradar. Given that the study explores aspects such as the storm duration, the clusters that\n\n190\n\nfailed to conform to QC2 are omitted from the analysis. Figure 1 illustrates examples\n\n191\n\nfrom a tracked cluster that exhibits a problematic tracking (e.g. cluster entering the area\n\n192\n\nwith already high flash rates, Fig. 1a), a normal tracking (i.e. comply with both QC1 and\n\n193\n\nQC2, Fig. 1b), a LJ0 cluster (Fig. 1c) and a LJ1 cluster (Fig. 1d) of comparable flash\n\n194\n\nrates.\n\n195\n\nAll three lightning detection systems indicate that the number of LJ1 clusters\n\n196\n\ndecreases as the \xce\xb1 and FRT values increase (i.e. fewer clusters at higher \xce\xb1 and FRT\n\n197\n\nvalues, Fig. 2b, d, and f). Unlike the LJ1, the number of tracked LJ0 clusters increases as\n\n198\n\nthe values of \xce\xb1 and FRT increase (Fig. 2a, c, and e). The latter should be expected since\n\n199\n\na LJ0 at e.g. \xce\xb1=2.0 and FRT=10 f m-1 will also not exhibit LJ at higher \xce\xb1 or FRT values.\n\n200\n\n3.2 The Autocorrelation function of LJ0 and LJ1 Flash Time Series.\n\n201\n\nAutocorrelation is an essential tool for describing the independence of sequential\n\n202\n\nvalues in a time series. A slow (fast) decaying autocorrelation function with time (i.e.\n\n203\n\nlag) indicates a consistent (random) behavior of the variable under consideration\n\n204\n\n(Bowerman and O\'Connell 1979). For example, a slow-decaying autocorrelation\n\n205\n\nfunction of lightning activity time-series would signal a coherent behavior in the storm\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n206\n\nupdraft speed and volume (e.g., Schultz et. al. 2009; 2011; Schultz et al. 2014).\n\n207\n\nConsequently, autocorrelation can elaborate on whether the presence of a LJ relates to a\n\n208\n\nnumerically random increase in the total lightning activity or points to a more persistent\n\n209\n\nfeature of the storm\'s dynamical evolution. The autocorrelation function is computed for\n10 of 45\n\n210\n\nthe flash rates of LJ0 and LJ1, by introducing a time lag that ranges from 1 to +N/2\n\n211\n\nminutes, where N is the number of 1-minute intervals during which the cluster is tracked\n\n212\n\n(i.e., lifespan). The lag at which the Pearson correlation is reduced below the 95%\n\n213\n\nsignificance level denotes the \xe2\x80\x9ce-folding\xe2\x80\x9d time.. Figure 3 illustrates the average e-folding\n\n214\n\ntimes for the LJ0 and LJ1 clusters for different \xce\xb1 and FRT values. The corresponding\n\n215\n\nresults (Fig. 3) show longer e-folding times for the LJ1 clusters. For example, the e-\n\n216\n\nfolding times for the LJ1 at \xce\xb1=2.0 and FRT=15 f m-1 are computed as ~12 min for LMA,\n\n217\n\n12.7 min for the ENTLN, and 11.5 min for the NLDN. Conversely, the e-folding times\n\n218\n\nfor the LJ0 for the same \xce\xb1 and FRT values are consistently less than ~4.0 min for all\n\n219\n\nthree lightning detection systems and any given \xce\xb1 and FRT value. Moreover, the fact\n\n220\n\nthat the e-folding times for LJ1 clusters increase as both \xce\xb1 and FRT values also increase,\n\n221\n\nillustrates a key observation that emphasizes the non-redundant numerical role of both\n\n222\n\nvariables \xce\xb1 and FRT in the LJ algorithmic implementation (Schultz et al. 2009; 2011).\n\n223\n224\n\n3.3 Comparison of storm severity potential and physical characteristics between\nthe LJ0 and LJ1 clusters.\n\n225\n\nThe previous section studied the LJ0 and LJ1 clusters exclusively from the\n\n226\n\nstandpoint of the flash rate temporal variation. This section explores the mean values of\n\n227\n\nstorm attributes derived from WDSS-II. As Fig. 4 demonstrates, the LJ1 clusters exhibit\n\n228\n\na longer lifespan than the respective LJ0, and this observation is consistent throughout\n\n229\n\nthe three lightning detection systems and all \xce\xb1 and FRT values. For example, for \xce\xb1=2.0\n\n230\n\nand FRT=15 f m-1, the average lifespan is 80 min, whereas the respective LJ0 lifespan is\n11 of 45\n\n231\n\napproximately 35 min. Similar behavior is evident for the mean flash rate (normalized\n\n232\n\nby the cluster\xe2\x80\x99s footprint area, f m-1 km-2, Fig. 5), MESH (Fig. 6) and VIL (Fig. 7)\n\n233\n\nvalues.\n\n234\n\nIn particular, Fig. 5 indicates that on average, the LJ1 clusters exhibit ~4-5 times\n\n235\n\nhigher flash rates than the respective LJ0. For instance, the average LJ1 flash rates for \xce\xb1\n\n236\n\n=2.0 and FRT=15 f m-1 are ~0.054 f m-1 km-2 as opposed to ~0.015 f m-1 km-2 for the\n\n237\n\nLJ0, an observation that is also consistent across all networks. In turn, the MESH values\n\n238\n\nfor the LJ1 clusters range from ~11-18 mm whereas the LJ0 corresponding values range\n\n239\n\nfrom ~6.5-10 mm (Fig. 6). Likewise, the mean values of VIL are ~ 18 kg m-2 for the\n\n240\n\nLJ0 and ~25 kg m-2 for the respective LJ1 (Fig. 7). As also highlighted in Section 3.2,\n\n241\n\nhigher flash rates, larger MESH and VIL values (Figs. 5-7) are found with increasing \xce\xb1\n\n242\n\nand FRT thresholds. One could argue that it would be expected to have higher\n\n243\n\nmagnitudes of weather severity proxies (e.g., MESH, VIL etc.) with higher flash rates.\n\n244\n\nNevertheless, the previous results also suggest that it is not only the flash rate (i.e., FRT)\n\n245\n\nthat exhibits a fundamental physical tie to storm intensity but also its temporal evolution\n\n246\n\n(i.e., \xce\xb1). The above results are also in agreement with the findings by Rudlosky and\n\n247\n\nFuelberg (2013).\n\n248\n\n3.4 LJ strength and storm decay time\n\n249\n\nThe results shown in Fig. 4 support that the LJ1 clusters with larger \xce\xb1 and FRT\n\n250\n\nrelate to storms with longer durations (Fig. 4). Approaching this from a different\n\n251\n\nperspective one can raise the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes the strength of the final LJ\n12 of 45\n\n252\n\noccurrence relate to the remaining lifespan of the cluster?\xe2\x80\x9d To address this question the\n\n253\n\ntime elapsed from the last LJ occurrence to the last time-step that a cluster is tracked is\n\n254\n\ncomputed in minutes. Arguably, the results in Fig. 8 corroborate that both \xce\xb1 and FRT\n\n255\n\nplay a role in the storms\xe2\x80\x99 remaining duration which shows to increase from around 30-\n\n256\n\n35 min for LJ1 of \xce\xb1 = 1.0 and FRT=10 f m-1 to over 45-60 min for higher \xce\xb1 and/or FRT\n\n257\n\nvalues.\n\n258\n\n4. Conclusions\n\n259\n\nThe observations herein indicate that the presence of LJ has implications for the\n\n260\n\nstorm dynamics, intensity and evolution. The e-folding times are lower for the LJ1\n\n261\n\nclusters. For example the e-folding times for the LJ1 at \xce\xb1 =2.0 and FRT=15 f m-1 are\n\n262\n\ncomputed as ~12 min for LMA, 12.7 min for the ENTLN, and 11.5 min for the NLDN.\n\n263\n\nConversely, the e-folding times for the LJ0 for the same \xce\xb1 and FRT values are\n\n264\n\nconsistently less than ~4.0 min for all three lightning detection systems. Through the\n\n265\n\nenhanced updraft hypothesis, these findings indicate that the presence of a LJ signals the\n\n266\n\nstorm\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sustain convection.\n\n267\n\nThe study also documents that LJ1 clusters last longer and exhibit higher flash\n\n268\n\nrates (area-normalized), MESH and VIL values, further corroborating previous studies\n\n269\n\nthat also suggest that the temporal total lightning variability is a dependable proxy for\n\n270\n\nsevere weather risk assessment (Williams 2001; Schultz et al. 2009; 2011; Rudlosky and\n\n271\n\nFuelberg 2013). In addition, the MESH values for the LJ1 clusters range from ~11-18\n\n272\n\nmm whereas the LJ0 respective values range from ~6.5-10 mm (Fig. 5). The mean\n13 of 45\n\n273\n\nvalues of VIL are ~ 18 kg m-2 for the LJ0 and ~25 kg m-2 for the LJ1 clusters.\n\n274\n\nThe results throughout this analysis consistently suggest that there is no\n\n275\n\nredundancy in the role of \xce\xb1 and FRT in the LJ numerical implementation. This is shown\n\n276\n\nby the increasing magnitudes of the implicated variables (e.g. e-folding time, MESH,\n\n277\n\nflash rate etc., see Fig.2-7) for LJ1 clusters increase as both \xce\xb1 and FRT values also\n\n278\n\nincrease. Finally, the study offers further evidence that the presence and temporal\n\n279\n\ncoincidence of a LJ could be viewed as a proxy of the storm\xe2\x80\x99s expected dissipation.\n\n280\n\nTypically, these values range between 20-60 min depending on the LJ strength with\n\n281\n\nstronger jumps indicating more time until storm decay.\n\n282\n\nOngoing efforts explore the value of the LJ as a component in the operational\n\n283\n\nsevere weather watch/warnings issuance (Schultz et al. 2014). The upcoming Geo-\n\n284\n\nstationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) onboard the GOES-R mission (Goodman et al.\n\n285\n\n2013) will provide continuous monitoring of total lightning activity across the Western\n\n286\n\nHemisphere. GLM will provide even greater detail on the linkage between temporal\n\n287\n\nlightning variability and the storm evolution over areas where currently related\n\n288\n\ninformation, including radar, is limited or nonexistent. Importantly, GLM will provide\n\n289\n\ncontinuous coverage of total lightning over a large domain to evaluate this study on the\n\n290\n\nglobal scale.\n\n291\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n292\n\nWe acknowledge the support by GOES-R System Program as part of the GOES-R\n\n293\n\nProving Ground and Risk Reduction programs.
