Timely and accurate forecast of wheat yield and\nproduction at global scale is vital in implementing food\nsecurity policy. Becker-Reshef et al.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the impact of incorporating yearly\nwheat masks into the forecasting model. We propose a new\napproach of producing in season winter wheat maps\nexploiting satellite data and official statistics on crop area\nonly. Validation on independent data showed that the\nproposed approach reached 6% to 23% of omission error\nand 10% to 16% of commission error when mapping winter\nwheat 2-3 months before harvest.

At present, winter\nwheat maps are not available at global scale and produced\nregularly for only selected countries [10]. Also, in many\ncases these maps are produced after the growing season\nmaking it difficult to use in crop forecasting models.\nIn this paper, we explore the value of adding winter\nwheat masks derived on yearly basis in winter wheat yield\nforecasting models [5], [8]. An automatic method for\nmapping winter crops based on satellite imagery and official\nstatistics is proposed. A theoretical error budget for the\nforecasting model is calculated in order to estimate\nuncertainties associated with the model\xe2\x80\x99s components.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n2. MATERIALS\n\nWheat is one of the most important crops in the world.\nTimely and accurate prediction of wheat yield and wheat\nproduction at global scale still remains a challenge from\nboth scientific and operational perspectives [1]. Remote\nsensing data from space enable monitoring and\nquantification of crop state at global scale. Biophysical\nparameters and vegetation indices derived from Earth\nobservation (EO) satellites are used to assimilate data into\ncrop growth models [2]\xe2\x80\x93[4] or used as proxies in empirical\nmodels to predict crop yield [5]\xe2\x80\x93[9]. Many models have\nbeen proposed so far at regional and global scale. BeckerReshef et al. (2010) [5] developed a generalized empirical\nmodel for forecasting winter wheat yield and production\nusing remote sensing data and official statistics. The main\npillar of the model is utilization of a relationship between\nthe yield, the seasonal peak normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI) derived from Moderate resolution\n\nThe study was performed for the state of Kansas, as one of\nthe main winter wheat producing states in the U.S., and\nUkraine. The winter wheat yield and production forecasting\nmodel was built using the following set of datasets: BRDFcorrected MODIS surface reflectance time series data [11] at\ndaily temporal resolution and 0.05\xc2\xb0 spatial resolution (5600\nm at the equator) of Climate Modeling Grid (CMG); official\nstatistics at administrative units (Agricultural Statistics\nDistricts for Kansas and oblast level for Ukraine); and\nwinter wheat masks.\nFor winter wheat mapping, we used NDVI temporal\nprofiles extracted from the MODIS MOD13Q1 product.\nMOD13Q1 images are provided every 16 days at the 250 m\nspatial resolution in the sinusoidal projection. NDVI images\nare composited over a 16-days interval to create a cloud-free\nmap with minimal atmospheric and sun-surface-sensor\nangular effects [12]. Data for the territory of Kansas and\n\nUkraine and 2000\xe2\x80\x932014 time interval were downloaded\nfrom the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center\n(LPDAAC)\nof\nthe\nUSGS\n(https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_pro\nducts_table). The MOD13Q1 NDVI composites were\nfurther converted to the Albers Equal Area projection.\nWe also used Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data for\nKansas for 2006\xe2\x80\x932014 in order to validate the proposed\napproach on in season winter wheat crop mapping.\n3. METHODOLOGY\n3.1. Winter wheat yield and production forecasting\nThe Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) method [5] is based on the\nassumption that the yield is positively and linearly\ncorrelated to the seasonal maximum NDVI (adjusted for\nbackground noise) at the administrative unit (AU, county or\noblast) level and to the purity of the wheat signal. Thus, they\ndeveloped a regression model that was calibrated and\napplied at the state level in Kansas and was proven directly\napplicable at the national level in Ukraine. Seasonal\nmaximum NDVI for AU is computed in the following way.\nFirst, daily average NDVI is calculated over the 5% purest\nwinter wheat pixels at 0.05\xc2\xb0. Then, the derived NDVI is\nadjusted for bare soil by subtracting the minimum 5%\nvalues for the years studied and seasonal maximum adjusted\nNDVI is computed (MA_NDVI). The model utilizes a\ngeneralized relationship S = 9.61 + (0.05Mpct), where Mcpt\nis the weighted average of the percent wheat values of the\npurest 5% wheat dominated pixels for each AU, to compute\nthe slope and the derived MA_NDVI value to predict the\nyield:\nYield = S * MA_NDVI.\nThis method was extended by Franch et al. (2015) [8] to\nincorporate GDD information to improve timeliness of the\nmodel. In particular, current and historical GDD and NDVI\nvalues are used to predict the NDVI peak, thus enabling to\nobtain forecasts of the yield and production 1-1.5 months\nbefore NDVI peak.\nA theoretical error budget for the model was analyzed\nto estimate uncertainties associated with the model\xe2\x80\x99s\ncomponents. The main components of the model are as\nfollows: NDVI derived from MODIS, winter wheat\npercentage and coefficients of the relationship between the S\nand Mpct. Corresponding partial derivatives for each model\ncomponent were calculated and the final error of the yield\nwas derived. Therefore, such approach allowed us to\nanalyze contribution of each component into the final yield\nuncertainties. We found that the derived theoretical error of\nwinter wheat yield forecasting at 0.05\xc2\xb0 resolution was\n8.5%\xe2\x80\x9318.3% that was consistent with previously derived\nresults when comparing to official statistics [5].\n3.2. In season winter crops mapping\n3.2.1. Method description\n\nThe winter wheat forecasting model was developed and\nimplemented using static winter wheat maps. In this study,\nwe analyze whether the use of dynamic yearly winter wheat\nmaps would improve the model while preserving its main\nadvantageous characteristics: little data input requirements,\napplicability at global scale and timeliness.\nYearly winter wheat maps are not available at global\nscale, and produced regularly only for select countries (e.g.\nCDL for USA). Therefore, it is necessary to provide an\napproach that can be applied at global scale with little\nrequirements to input data, and can produce in season winter\nwheat masks (2-2.5 months before harvest) in order to\nrespect timeliness capabilities of the forecasting model.\nThe following approach is proposed in this paper that is\nbased on NDVI derived from MOD13 product at 250 m\nspatial resolution, official statistics on planted crop area at\nAU and cropland mask. The approach is based on the\nphenological development of winter wheat that has the\ndeveloped biomass in late autumn and early spring while\nother crops have no biomass within these time periods. For\neach pixel at 250 m resolution, we derive two features\n(hereafter denoted as \xe2\x80\x9cFall\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSpring\xe2\x80\x9d) from MODIS\nNDVI time-series that exhibit maximum NDVI values\nduring two time periods: autumn of the previous year and\nearly spring in the current year. The derived maximum\nNDVI values are also subtracted from 15 years average\nminimum NDVI during the crop growth season to account\nfor soil background.\nIn order to identify winter wheat pixels corresponding\nthresholds for derived features are to be calculated. Only\ncropland pixels were taken into account. Thresholds for\nfeatures to discriminate between winter crops and nonwinter crops were derived by calculating the area for\ncorresponding AUs and matching it to official statistics on\nplanted areas. These thresholds were calculated separately\nfor each AU in order to account for regional peculiarities of\nwheat growth.\n3.2.2. Method implementation and validation\nThis approach was applied for Kansas and Ukraine to derive\nyearly winter wheat masks for 2001-2014. Maximum NDVI\nvalues for deriving the \xe2\x80\x9cFall\xe2\x80\x9d feature were selected from 31Oct to 31-Dec for Kansas and Ukraine, and maximum\nNDVI values for extracting the \xe2\x80\x9cSpring\xe2\x80\x9d feature were\nselected from 22-Mar to 25-May for Ukraine, and from 06Mar to 22-Apr for Kansas. These time periods were selected\ntaking into account several factors, in particular availability\nof MODIS images and phenological development of winter\nwheat comparing to other crop types in the study areas.\nThresholds for \xe2\x80\x9cFall\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSpring\xe2\x80\x9d features were calculated\nin such a way to match official statistics on planted winter\nwheat areas at ASD level in Kansas and oblast level in\nUkraine.\n\nUsually official statistics on crop area serves as a source\nfor validating the derived maps. However, this cannot be\napplied in our case since official statistics was used for\ncalculating and calibrating thresholds for identifying winter\nwheat pixels. Therefore, CDL maps for Kansas were used to\nindependently validate the proposed approach.\n4. RESULTS\nThe winter wheat masks for Kansas derived using the\nproposed approach were compared to the CDL derived\nmasks at different scales: (i) at CDL spatial resolution to\nestimate omission error (OE) and commission error (CE) of\nthe derived maps (Fig. 1); (ii) at 0.05\xc2\xb0 resolution to estimate\nthe differences of wheat proportions at this scale from the\nproposed approach and CDL (Fig. 2).\nWhen comparing the winter wheat masks produced\nwith the proposed approach to the CDL-derived masks, the\naverage over the 2006-2014 period omission error (OE) was\n13% and commission error (CE) was 11%. The best values\nwere obtained for 2006 with OE of 6.1% and CE of 9.8%,\nand the worst values were obtained for 2013 with OE of\n23.4% and CE of 15.4%. Fig. 1 shows comparison of winter\nwheat masks derived from CDL and using the proposed\napproach depending on the winter wheat purity pixel at\n250 m resolution. Blue line in Fig. 1 shows theoretical\nPareto boundary derived from 56 m (2006) CDL maps. The\nCDL maps for winter crops were converted to the 250 m\nproportional maps. For each threshold that defines winter\ncrop, a low resolution 250 m binary map was derived and\ncompared to high resolution map (at 56 m resolution), and a\npair OE/CE was estimated. Red line in Fig. 1 shows the\nPareto boundary for the derived maps. Different points were\nderived utilizing different thresholds for determining winter\ncrops purity at 250 m resolution.\n\nFig. 1. Comparison of OE and CE values for the CDL mask (blue\nline) and derived mask (red line) for Kansas in 2006 depending on\nthe winter wheat purity pixel at 250 m resolution.\n\nThe main causes of errors were spatial discrepancy\nbetween the derived maps at 250 m resolution and the\nreference CDL at 56 m or 30 m (after 2010) resolution, and\n\nextreme meteorological conditions that forced considerable\ndelays in wheat development and therefore inability to\ndetect winter crops from satellite imagery during the used\nautumn or spring periods. In particular, in 2013 Kansas\nexperienced lack of precipitation and freezing temperatures\n(especially in western part) that caused only 27% of crops to\nbe in good to excellent by the end of April where the\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpring\xe2\x80\x9d features were selected.\nComparison of winter wheat proportions at 0.05\xc2\xb0\nresolution derived from CDL and our maps showed small\ndifference: average over the 2006-2014 period root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) was 4.75% and R squared was 0.9.\n\nFig. 2. Comparison of winter wheat proportions for Kansas for\n2006 at 0.05\xc2\xb0 resolution using CDL and the proposed approach.\n\nFig. 3. Winter wheat yield predictions versus official statistics for\nUkraine for 2001-2015 using a GDD and yearly masks\nincorporated model.\n\nThe derived yearly winter wheat maps for Ukraine were\nfurther incorporated into the forecasting model to predict the\nwinter wheat yield for Ukraine at national level. Fig. 3\n\nshows the comparison of the derived results for 2001-2015\nversus official statistics when applying the model with GDD\ninformation, i.e. 40 days before NDVI peak. The obtained\nRMSE between satellite-derived forecasts and official\nstatistics at national level was 0.64 t/ha. This accuracy was\nachieved around May 5th, i.e. 40 days before NDVI peak for\nwinter wheat, which is 2-2.5 months before harvest that\ntakes place, as a rule, in late June or early July.\nIn general, we found a limited impact of using yearly\nmaps over a static map suggesting little contribution at 0.05\xc2\xb0\nresolution to the final yield error. This was also observed in\nKansas when applying the CDL derived winter wheat\nmasks. This approach will be further applied to other major\nwheat regions to identify on the impact of using yearly\nwheat masks in the forecasting model.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we explored the impact of using yearly winter\nwheat masks when averaging NDVI in the winter wheat\nyield forecasting model operating at 0.05\xc2\xb0 resolution. For\nthis, we proposed a new approach for in season winter\nwheat mapping that is relied on satellite imagery and official\nstatistics data only. The approach is based on manually\nconstructed features to capture dynamics of winter wheat\ncomparing to other crop types and official statistics on\nadministrative units to calibrate feature values. The\ndeveloped approach has the following advantages: little\ninput data requirements; potential to be applicable at global\nscale in automatic way; and in season capabilities.\nDisadvantages include: failing to identify winter wheat\nfields in case of considerable delays in crop growth. The\nderived yearly masks were incorporated into the winter\nwheat yield forecasting model for Ukraine and Kansas. We\nfound a limited impact of using yearly winter wheat masks\nover a static mask for the study regions.\n6. REFERENCES\n[1] I. Becker-Reshef, C. Justice, M. Sullivan, E. Vermote, C.\nTucker, A.
