Individuals (challenge owners) post their speci\xef\xac\x81c problem\nor \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge.\xe2\x80\x9d Anyone in the community (solvers) can contribute to the interactive discussions and\nsubmit proposed solutions with the opportunity to win an award.\n\nDetermine Fit of Challenge for\nNASA@work (LASSO)\n\nNASA@Work Awards\n\nTo determine if your challenge idea is a good \xef\xac\x81t\nfor NASA@work, ask \xef\xac\x81ve simple questions:\n1. Is your problem Limited in Scope? Topic must\nbe speci\xef\xac\x81c and focused so solvers can provide\nsolutions quickly and efficiently.\n2. Is it Actionable? Is it possible for a reasonable\nsolution to be acted upon?\n3. Is the content of the challenge written with\nenough detail and is Speci\xef\xac\x81c and\nunambiguous? Content must be clear and\nconcise.\n4. Is there adequate Sponsorship for the\nchallenge? In other words, do you have the\nsupport and commitment of your organization?\n5. Is there Ownership of the solution? Do you or\nyour organization have a direct need for a\nsolution and clear responsibility for executing?\n\nChallenge Types\nExamples of challenges well suited for the\nNASA@work site:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Generating new ideas- solvers provide high\nvolume brainstorming power\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Developing new concept - solvers help identify\nnew ideas/technologies\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Adding structure, de\xef\xac\x81nition (i.e., \xef\xac\x81ne-tuning)\na challenge/problem \xe2\x80\x93 solvers lend agency\nwide expertise to assist\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Looking to increase access to information or\ncon\xef\xac\x81rm you have all research and information\non a speci\xef\xac\x81c problem \xe2\x80\x93 solvers give you access\nto siloed or undocumented knowledge base\n(e.g., technical survey, knowledge survey)\n\nchallenge\n\ncollaboration\n\ninnovation\n\nsolutions\n\nWith the help of our NASA@work solver\ncommunity, we have created a new award\nstructure. For new challenges, 1-3 award\ncategories will be selected for each challenge\nwith the goal of ensuring challenges and awards\nare commensurate. Potential awards include:\n1. Cool NASA Experience (e.g., driving the\nRover or Food Lab!)\n2. Astronaut Autographed Item (e.g., autograph\nfrom an astronaut personalized for you)\n3. Item Flown in Space (e.g., NASA@work logo\npatch that has been \xef\xac\x82own in space)\n4. NASA External Public Recognition (e.g., being\nhighlighted on nasa.gov)\n5. Recognition by Center Director and Agency\nManagement (e.g., Lunch with the Director)\n6. Call from Space/Social Media Recognition\nfrom Astronaut (e.g., call from ISS or a Tweet\nfrom space)\n7. Themed Award System (system designed to\nrecognize active solvers or multi-winning\nsolvers)\n\nHow to access NASA@work\nVisit https://nasa.innocentive.com\nFor additional information contact Kathryn\nKeeton at kathryn.keeton@nasa.gov.\n\nchallenge\n\ncollaboration\n\ninnovation\n\nsolutions\n\nReview Submissions\nand Select Winner\n\n(2 weeks)\n\nEvaluate\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwarded\xe2\x80\x9d or\n\xe2\x80\x9cClosed\xe2\x80\x9d status\nNotification\n\nReview Feedback from\nReviewers; Make\nNecessary Changes\n\nUse this roadmap to successfully and easily navigate the NASA@work\nchallenge, development, posting and evaluation process.\nPlease Note: No cost to post challenge; awards are coordinated through\nthe CoECI Office\n\nActively Participate on\nChallenge; Respond to\nInputs and Answer\nQuestions\n\n(4-6 weeks)\n\nParticipate\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder Evaluation\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\nMake Any Final Changes;\nApprove for Posting\n\nChallenge Owner\nAction\n\nTalk with NASA@work\nCoach to Provide Feedback about Experience\n\n(1 week)\n\nClose-Out\n\nNASA@work Challenge Status\nemail Notifications\n\nSuccessful Completion of\na NASA@work Challenge\n\nWorkbench on NASA@work\n\nProvide Needed Inputs\nto Complete Challenge\nDraft\n\n(up to 1 week)\n\nRefine\n\n(1-2 weeks)\n\nReview\n\nFinalize\n(1-2 days)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cDraft\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\nTalk with NASA@work\nCoach to Determine Fit\nof Challenge for\nNASA@work platform\n\n(up to 1 week)\n\nDiscuss\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPending\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\nSuggest a Challenge\nfor NASA@work\n\n(approx 30 min)\n\nSubmit\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandidate\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\nChallenge Owners\nStart Here\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuggested\xe2\x80\x9d\nstatus\nNotification\n\nNASA@work Challenge Owner Roadmap\n\n'
