In accordance with this approach, half of the gaseous hydrogen is used to generate 3.87 kW, while the remaining hydrogen and the resulting water are remotely vented using the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870057917, "id": "7eeeb6961786464fa4f111fdbd137e1b", "publicationDate": "1987-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
