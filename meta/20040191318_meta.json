Drawing on ideas concerning the eruption and evolution of CMEs, we had anticipated that there might be a tendency for CMEs to contain progressively more open field lines, as reconnection back at the Sun either opened or completely disconnected previously closed field lines threading the CMEs. Our results, however, did not yield any discernible trend. By combining the potential contribution of CMEs to the heliospheric flux with the observed build-up of flux during the course of the solar cycle we also derive a lower limit for the reconnection rate of CMEs that is sufficient to avoid the \"flux catastrophe\" paradox. This rate is well below our threshold of detectability.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040191318, "id": "25f62d86083b496a9e0b3947252bc966", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040191318.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040191318/downloads/20040191318.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040191318/downloads/20040191318.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040191318/downloads/20040191318.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
