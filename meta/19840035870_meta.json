The morphological units of the Peruvian Andes are characterized: coastal plains, Cordillera Occidental, altiplano and central high plateau, Cordillera Oriental, and sub-Andes. The data base and analysis methodology are discussed, and the results are presented in tables, diagrams, graphs, maps, and photographs illustrating typical formations. Most of the earthquakes are shown to occur in the transition zone from the sub-Andes to the Cordillera Oriental under formations of about 1 km elevation at focal depths of 10-38 km. It is suggested that the sub-Andean earthquakes reflect hinterland deformation of a detached fold and thrust belt, perhaps like that which occurred in parts of the Canadian Rockies. From the total crustal shortening evident in Andean morphology and the shortening rate of the recent earthquakes it is estimated that the topography and crustal root of the Andes have been formed during the last 90-135 Myr.", "title": "Seismicity, fault plane solutions, depth of faulting, and active tectonics of the Andes of Peru, Ecuador, and southern Colombia", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T01:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840035870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Suarez, G."}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "dfd733ebe3704b30917c7661de4adef3"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19840035870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Molnar, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Cambridge, MA, United States"}}, "id": "2dd3ed83640b4b9c8b38cfcebcd0d3c6"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19840035870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Burchfiel, B.
