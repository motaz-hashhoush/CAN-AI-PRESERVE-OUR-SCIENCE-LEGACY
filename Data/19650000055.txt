This is because the reactive parameter being changed to achieve\nfrequency control is masked by the shunting effect of\nrelatively low fixed impedances.\nThe solution: A tetrode-driven crystal oscillator in\nwhich the frequency is controlled by variation of the\nsecond base (13 2 ) current of the tetrode operated in\nthe reverse mode.\nHow it's done: The circuit uses a crystal as a resonating element in a standard feedback oscillator commonly in use. In normal operation, current flows out\n\nof B 2 and input capacitance is shunted by the low resistance of the forward-biased emitter-base diode. This\neffectively reduces the change in frequency that could\notherwise be obtained by varying the input capacitance.\nThe circuit illustrated operates on the characteristic\nchange in output capacitance achieved by causing B2\ncurrent to flow in the direction opposite (toward or\ninto 13 2) flow in the normal mode. Collector bias is\nsuch that the thermistor regulates the collector-first\nbase (B 1) voltage and thus the output capacitance to\ncompensate for any decrease in frequency with temperature. In this mode, increases in B 2 current are\nused to change output capacitance and thus change\nfrequency of oscillation.\n(continued overleaf)\n\n-.\t\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

In one configuration used, average frequency con- \t\ntrol of 0.27 cps per microamp change has been\t\nachieved.\t\n2. Using a variable frequency oscillator circuit (not \t\ncrystal controlled), frequency variations of 0.25 mc \t\nat a 0.75-mc center frequency have been realized by \t\nincreasing B 2 current from 150 to 200 microamps. \t\n\n3.
