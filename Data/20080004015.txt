Other contaminants which can be present are HCN, H2S, SO2 and halogens such as Cl2. Such\ncontaminants are generally present in vapor form in the\nwaste gas mixture. Inorganic and organic particulate\nmaterials in powder or solid form can also be present.\nThe level of concentration of contaminants in the waste\ngas mixture can range from as low as 5 ppm (parts per\nmillion) to stress corrosion environments as high as 5%\nby weight of the gas mixture.\nThe waste gas mixture is generally compressed to a\npressure ranging from about 100 to about 3000 psi, e.g.\nabout 1000 psi, and is discharged into and stored in a\npressure vessel according to the invention. Such pressure vessel is a container formed of a metal liner and a\ncomposite overwrap, the composite overwrap being\nstressed in tension and the metal liner being stressed in\ncompression during operation to provide stress corrosion cracking resistance throughout storage of the\nwaste gas mixture. A preferred metal liner for storing\nwaste gases containing contaminants according to the\ninvention and from a general corrosion standpoint is\ncomposed of a nickel alloy such as Inconel 718 or Incone1 625. However, depending on the particular composition of the waste gases and contaminants therein other\nmetal liners can be employed such as stainless steel, e.g.\n316L or 304L stainless steel, or aluminum alloys such as\n6061-T6.\nThe composite materials employed as overwrap on\nthe metal liner can be those typically employed in state\nof the art composite pressure vessels and which achieve\nthe desired compressive stress state of the metal liner.\nFor this purpose, fiament wound resin composite materials employed are those suitable for withstanding high\nfluid pressures. The filament used can be graphite, Kevlar, which is poly(paraphenylterephthalamide), glass\nand boron fibers. The resin employed can be any suitable resin having high strength, such as epoxy, polyether and polyether ether ketone (PEEK), and are usually thermoset-based resins.\nComposite pressure vessels with a compressively\nstressed metal liner for mixed compressed waste gas\nstorage according to the invention can be produced\naccording to the method of above U.S. Pat. No.\n3,969,812. The force balance between the liner prestressed in compression and its overwrap prestressed in\ntension is obtained before the vessel is placed into service. According to the method of the patent, after formation of the liner to the desired shape of the vessel, the\nfilament winding operation is performed. The filament\nemployed is drawn through a resin filled reservoir to\nresin coat the filament before it is wrapped. The filament is then wrapped in a plurality of layers around the\nliner, which can be generally of cylindrical shape and\nwhich can be closed at opposite ends as by a bottom and\nneck portion.\nAfter the vessel has been overwrapped with the filament wound resin composite, heat curing of such overwrap is carried out. The heat curing step can be carried\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\nout at temperatures ranging from about 250 to about\n350" F. depending on the particular resin employed.\nAfter the vessel has been overwrapped and heat\ncured, a sizing pressurization step is performed. This is\naccomplished by increasing the pressure in the vessel to\na pressure exceeding the yield strength of the metallic\nliner and then reducing the vessel pressure to ambient.\nDuring this cycle, when the pressure exceeds the\nyield strength of the metallic liner, the liner will deform\nDlasticallv outwardlv and tend to retain the d a r n e d\nconfiguration to which the liner was plastically >eformed. However, the elastic limit of the filament overwrap will not be exceeded during the pressurization and\nplastic deformation of the liner. Due to the plastic deformation of the liner, when the liner has elastically\nunloaded, the filament overwrap is still in tension.\nTherefore, the fdament overwrap applies generally\ninwardly directed forces to the outer surface of the liner\nwhen it reaches the elastically unloaded condition.\nThese outwardly directed overwrap forces are effective\nto compress and elastically deform the liner. However,\nthey are of insufficient magnitude to plastically deform\nthe liner in compression. Therefore, after the sizing\npressurization cycle the overwrap filament is stressed in\nresidual tension and the liner is stressed in residual compression.\nThe above method for producing a composite pressure vessel with a compressively stressed metal liner is\ndescribed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 3,969,812, and forms\nno part of the present invention.\nFor greater clarity, FIGS. 1 and 2 of the drawing\nillustrate a composite pressure vessel having a compressively stressed metal liner produced according to U.S.\nPat. No. 3,969,812, and which can be employed in the\npresent invention, wherein\nFIG. 1 is a composite view of a completely overwrapped pressure vessel, and\nFIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken on line 2 of\nFIG. 1.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 liner 10 includes a cylindrical portion 12 and a pair of hemispherically shaped\ndome portions 14 at each end of the cylindrical portion.\nAt least one dome portion 14 includes a neck portion 16\ncontaining a fluid port 17 and the other end is suitably\ncontoured as at 21, but does not contain a fluid port.\nStopper means such as 19 is provided to seal fluid port\n17.\nAs shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the overwrap material\npattern includes a polar oriented filament overwrap 20\nwhich covers the entire surface of the inner and which\nis in engagement therewith. Cylindrically oriented fdament ovewrap 22 overlies the polar overwrap 20 and, as\nshow in FIGS. 1 and 2, includes a portion 24 which\ncovers the junction of the cylindrical portion of the\nliner and the dome portion of the liner (the area of the\nliner designated 25) and extends over part of the dome\nportion 14.\nA second polar filament overwrap 26 is shown covering the first cylindrical overwrap 22 and has the effect\nof holding the cylindrical overwrap 22 against movement relative to the liner. The portion of the overwrap\nmaterial near the neck of the vessel is defined in broken\n9\nlines at 2 .The fmal step involves the application of the\ntop cylindrical filament overwrapping material against\nthe liner. As particularly depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2 the\ntop cylindrical overwrap 28 does not extend over the\njunction between the cylindrical portion and either\ndome portion.\n\n5\n\n5,284,996\n\nAS previously noted, the waste gas mixture contain-\n\n6\n\nmetal container is under substance tensile stresses genering contaminants according to the invention is stored at\nated by said pressurized gas mixture,\nhigh pressure, e.g. at about 1100 psi, and at temperature\nthe improvement which comprises passing said preswhich can range from about 200 to about 300\' F., desurized gas mixture into a container formed of a\npending upon the cure temperature of the particular S\nmetal liner and a composite overwrap, and storing\nresin employed in the overwrap.
