booster motor case insulation was asbestos silica-filled\nnitrile butadiene rubber (AS-NBR)\n\xef\x82\x98 Due to material obsolescence and a desire for a more environmentally friendly\nmaterial, the SLS program has chosen to use a PBI-NBR insulator\n\xef\x82\x98 PBI-NBR insulation was used successfully on Demonstration Motor (DM)-1, -2, and 3 static tests; however, unacceptable conditions were discovered via X-ray of the\noriginal QM-1 aft segment\n\xef\x82\x98\n\n\xef\x83\x98 Two propellant voids and two propellant-liner-insulation (PLI) separations were\ndetected\n\xef\x83\x98 An investigation was initiated\n\xef\x83\x98 It was determined that the motor PBI-NBR insulation enables off-gassing of sufficient\nmagnitude to create thin-film propellant separations near the propellant liner interface\nduring the propellant cure process\n\xe2\x88\x92 Rubber materials such as AS-NBR and SF-NBR also trap and retain large amounts of\nair; however, how the air and volatiles are released during the cure process is unique to\nPBI-NBR relative to previous experience\n\n17\n\n3.0 Insulation Development\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nIn order to resolve the PBI-NBR related concerns, a set of improvements were\nimplemented on the QM-1 aft segment that included:\n\xef\x83\x98\n\xef\x83\x98\n\xef\x83\x98\n\xef\x83\x98\n\xef\x83\x98\n\xef\x83\x98\n\nExtended devolatization and dry-cycles to drive air and volatiles out of the insulation\nImproved vacuum system during insulation cure\nInsulation lay-up changes to minimize entrapped air\nImproved insulation blister repairs\nEnhanced environmental controls in the work center\nThe addition of a barrier to stop gas transfer during propellant cast / cure process\n\nNew Vacuum Bag System\n\n18\n\n3.0 Insulation Development\nThe insulation lay-up changes are critical to minimize the volume of air available for\ntransfer during propellant cast and cure\n\xef\x82\x98 The barrier addition is key to stopping gas transfer of any remaining air or volatiles\ninto the propellant during the cast / cure process\n\xef\x82\x98 The addition of the barrier and process improvements resulted in the most defect free\naft segment ever produced\n\xef\x82\x98 These improved processing techniques and barrier implementation will be part of the\nentire motor build for the second qualification motor of the redesigned RSRMV (QM2) and following SLS flight motors\n\xef\x82\x98\n\n19\n\n4.0 Nozzle Development\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nThe larger RSRMV required a modified nozzle design\n\xef\x83\x98 RSRM nozzle utilized a 7.72 expansion ratio, while a 7.2 expansion ratio is used for\nRSRMV\n\xef\x83\x98 Throat diameter, exit diameter, and length all increased in order to control the volume\nand velocity of the gases that are generated in the RSRMV design\n\n20\n\n4.0 Nozzle Development\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nThe RSRMV nozzle has evolved during the SLS booster path to qualification\n\xef\x83\x98 The flex boot is now fabricated with PBI-NBR versus AS-NBR on RSRM\n\xef\x83\x98 Significant changes were made to the nozzle joints\n\xe2\x88\x92 Room temperature vulcanized silicon-based sealant (RTV) filled joints have been replaced\nwith carbon fiber rope and thermal barrier O-rings in two joints\n\xe2\x88\x92 In one joint, the RTV was removed and a barrier O-ring added\n\n\xef\x83\x98 A new forward end ring (FER) has been incorporated\n\xe2\x88\x92 Flex bearing attachment was moved to the nose inlet housing\n\n\xef\x83\x98 Aft exit cone (AEC) ply angle was changed in order to minimize potential for ply lifting\n\xef\x83\x98 Forward nose ring (FNR) ply angle was also changed to address abnormal erosion\n\xef\x83\x98 A triple wrap cowl (glass-cloth-phenolic / carbon-cloth-phenolic / carbon-cloth-phenolic)\nreplaced the heritage silica-cloth-phenolic / carbon-cloth-phenolic cowl\n\xe2\x88\x92 To avoid structural design challenges of widely variable silica-cloth-phenolic material\nproperties\n\n21\n\n4.0 Nozzle Development\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nAfter the DM-2 static test, abnormal erosion on the FNR was observed\n\xef\x83\x98 Although the design requirements were met, an investigation team was formed\n\xef\x83\x98 The DM-3 nozzle was built the same as DM-2, but was instrumented with ultrasonic\ngages to monitor erosion during burn in order to capture timing and magnitude of the\nabnormal erosion\n\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nOn DM-3, abnormal FNR erosion was once again observed, very similar to the\nobserved DM-2 erosion\n\xef\x83\x98 With the ultrasonic gage data, it was determined that the erosion was due to a series of\nevents and environments that individually would not or could not explain the post-test\nobservations but together provided the post-test erosion signature\n\xe2\x88\x92 Events include localized delamination of the forward end of the FNR and / or nose cap\nin the short ply regions (wedgeout)\n\xe2\x88\x92 This exposed the ply faces / lifts / separations that were then removed by the particle\nimpingement environment\n\xe2\x97\xa6 The sloughing of the plies would arrest due to improved venting or development\nof a char cap\n\xe2\x88\x92 With this condition occurring early in burn, the particle impingement erosion during the\nremainder of the motor burn would erode the phenolics to the final observed profile\nhaving washed out the initial trigger indications\n22\n\n4.0 Nozzle Development\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nDue to this abnormal erosion, design changes were implemented for QM-1\n\xef\x83\x98 In addition, it was felt that nonflight-like motor sag exacerbated the erosion due to\nhigher particle impingement early in burn on the inlet regions at the bottom of the\nnozzle\n\xef\x83\x98 QM-1 implemented an additional mid-span support in order to produce flight-like\nmotor deflection during static test to minimize non-flight like particle impingement\nData issue, not hardware related\n\n23\n\n5.0 Test Data\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nOver 530 channels of instrumentation were gathered on the QM-1 static test\n\xef\x83\x98 Post-test analysis of these data in combination with post-test hardware evaluation is used to\ndetermine the successful completion of test objectives\n\xef\x83\x98 The instrumentation data processing is currently in work and the motor is being\ndisassembled\n\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nAll indications to date point towards a very successful QM-1 test\n\xef\x83\x98 There are no indications of abnormal erosion on the nozzle FNR as was seen on DM-2 and\nDM-3\n\xef\x83\x98 All phenolic components inspected have been in excellent shape with no signs of abnormal\nerosion, pocketing, or ply lifting\n\xef\x83\x98 There are no indications of motor insulation issues\n\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nBallistics performance parameters were within allowable requirements based on\npreliminary data and quick look analysis methodology\n\xef\x83\x98 The measured maximum pressure was greater than predicted early in motor burn similar to\nDM-3 performance, which was also tested at an elevated temperature\n\xef\x83\x98 The ballistics team is assessing approaches to improve the ballistics predictions for this\ncondition\n\n\xef\x82\x98\n\nThe TVC actuator servovalve delta pressure data showed some unexpected results;\nhowever, no anomalous performance was seen in the TVC duty cycle\n\xef\x83\x98 The avionics and TVC teams are investigating the cause of this unexpected condition and /\nor measurements\n\nOverall, QM-1 was a very successful test\n\n24\n\n6.0 Conclusion\nQM-1 is a critical milestone in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SLS program\nwhich will enable bold human missions to Mars and\ninvigorate the hopes and ambitions of humanity\n\xef\x82\x98 This SLS booster qualification test demonstrated both\nthe successes of the past Shuttle program and exciting\nadvances developed for the next-generation SLS\nprogram, including updated insulation, nozzle, and\navionics designs\n\xef\x82\x98 QM-1 will be followed by QM-2 and then vehicle\nflights (EM-1, EM-2 and beyond)\n\xef\x82\x98\n\n25\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe work described in this paper was funded
