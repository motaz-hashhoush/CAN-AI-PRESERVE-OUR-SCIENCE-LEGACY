These satellites provide global data to NOAA\'s short- and long-range weather forecasting systems. The\nsystem consists of two polar-orbiting satellites known as the Advanced Television Infrared Observation\nSatellites (TIROS-N) (ATN). Operating as a pair, these satellites ensure that environmental\ndata, for any region of the Earth, is no more than six hours old.\n\n\xc2\xa2\'IE\n\nThese polar-orbiting satellites have not only provided cost-effective data for very immediate and real needs but also for extensive climate and research programs. The weather\ndata (including images seen on television news programs) has afforded both convenience and safety to viewers throughout\nthe world. The satellites also support the\nSARSAT (Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking) part of the COSPAS-SARSAT\nconstellation.\nRussia provides the COSPAS (Russian for Space Systems for the Search\nof Vessels in Distress) satellites. The international COSPAS-SARSAT\nsystem provides\nfor the detection and location of emergency beacons for ships, aircraft, and people in\ndistress and has contributed to the saving of more than 10,000 lives since its inception in\n1982.\nNOAA-L\nLockheed\n\nMartin Space Systems\n\nCompany\nNOAA-L\n\nNOAA-L\n\nCHARACTERISTICS\n\nMain body:\n\n4.2 m (13.75 ft.) long, 1.88 m\n(6.2 ft.) diameter\n\nSolar array:\n\n2.73 by 6.14 m (8.96 by 20.16\nft.): 16.76 m2(180.63 ft.2)\n\nWeight:\n\nAt liftoff -2231.7 kg (4920 Ibs.)\nWeight includes 75617kg of\nexpendable fuel.\n\nLifetime:\n\nGreater than 2 years\n\nLoad Power\n833 Watts for 0\xc2\xb0 sun angle,\nRequirements 750 Watts for 80\xc2\xb0 sun angle\n\nis the latest in the advanced\n\nTIROS-N\n\n(ATN) series built by Lockheed Martin Space\nSystems Company (LMSSC).

The\ninstrument measures\nreflected solar\n(visible and near-IR) energy and radiated thermal energy from land, sea,\nclouds, and the intervening\natmosphere. The instrument has an instantaneous field-of-view\n(IFOV) of 1.3\n\nAVHRR/3\n\nmilliradians providing a nominal spatial\nresolution of 1.1 km (0.69 mi) at nadir. A continuously rotating elliptical scan mirror\nprovides the cross-track scan, scanning the Earth from + 55.4 \xc2\xb0 from nadir. The mirror\nscans at six revolutions per second to provide continuous coverage.\nThe AVHRPU3 provides spectral and gain improvements\nto the solar visible channels\nthat provide low light energy detection. Channel 3A, at 1.6 microns, provides snow, ice,\nand cloud discrimination.\nChannel 3A will be time-shared with the 3.7-micron channel,\ndesignated 3B, to provide five channels of continuous data. An external sun shield and\nan internal baffle have been added to reduce sunlight impingement into the instrument\'s\noptical cavity and detectors.\nHIGH RESOLUTION\nITT-A/CD\n\nINFRARED\n\nRADIATION\n\nSOUNDER\n\n(HIRS/3)\n\nThe HIRS/3 is an atmospheric sounding instrument with one visible channel, seven\nshortwave IR channels, and t2 longwave\nIR channels. The IFOV for each channel is\napproximately\n1.4 \xc2\xb0 in the visible and shortwave IR channels, and 1.3\xc2\xb0 in the longwave\nIR band which, from an altitude of 833 km\n(517.6 mi), provides a nominal spatial resolution at nadir of 20.3 km (12.6 mi) and 18.9\n\nHIRS/3\n\nNOAA-L/4\n\nkm( t 1.7 mi), respectively. The scan mirror\nprovides a cross track scan of 56 steps of\n1.8" each. Each Earth scan takes 6.4 sec-\n\nonds and covers +49.5 \xc2\xb0 from nadir. IR calibration\n\nof the HIRS/3 is provided by views of\n\nspace and the internal warm target, each viewed once per 38 Earth scans.\nThe instrument measures scene radiance in the infrared spectrum. Data from the instrument is used, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)\ninstruments, to calculate the atmosphere\'s\nvertical temperature profile from the Earth\'s\nsurface to about 40 km (24.9 mi) altitude. The data is also used to determine ocean\nsurface temperatures,\ntotal atmospheric\nand coverage, and surface radiance.\nADVANCED\n\nMICROWAVE\n\nSOUNDING\n\nozone levels, precipitable\n\nUNIT-A\n\nwater, cloud height\n\n(AMSU-A)\n\nAerojet\nThe AMSU-A measures scene radiance\ninstrument is used in con-\n\nin the microwave\n\nspectrum.\n\nThe data from this\n\njunction with the HIRS to\ncalculate the global atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles\nfrom the\nEarth\'s surface to the upper\nstratosphere, approximately\na 2-millibar pressure altitude\n(48 km or 29.8 mi).

The NOAA spacecraft carries two\ninstruments\nto detect these emergency\nbeacons: the Search and Rescue Repeater\n(SARR) provided by Canada and the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2) provided by France. Similar instruments are carried by the Russian COSPAS polar-orbiting\nsatellites.\n\nEMERGENCY\nBEACON\n\nSearch and Rescue Sequence\n\nNOAA-L/8\n\nof Events\n\nThe SARR transponds the signals of 121.5,243, and 406.05 MHz emergency beacons.\nHowever, these beacon signals are detected on the ground only if the satellite Js in view\nof a ground station known as a Local User Terminal (LUT). The SARP detects the\nsignal only from 406 MHz beacons but stores the information for subsequent downlink\nto a LUT. Thus, global detection of 406 MHz emergency beacons is provided.\nAfter receipt of information\nfrom a satellite\'s SARP or SARR, a LUT locates the\nbeacons by Doppler processing. The 121.5-MHz and 243-MHz beacons are located\nwith an accuracy of approximately\n20 km (12.4), whereas the 406-MHz beacons are\nlocated with an accuracy of approximately\n4 km (2.5 mi). The LUT forwards the located information to a corresponding\nMission Control Center (MCC), which, after further processing, forwards the information to an appropriate Rescue Coordination Center\nthat effects search and rescue.\nThe U.S. fishing fleet is required to carry 406 MHz emergency beacons. The 406 MHz\nbeacons are also carried on most large international ships, some aircraft, and pleasure\nvessels, as well as on terrestrial carriers. The 121.5-MHz and 243-MHz beacons are\nrequired\n\non many small aircraft\n\nDATA COLLECTION\nCNES/France\n\nSYSTEM\n\nwith a smaller number carried on maritime\n\nvessels.\n\n(DCS/2)\n\nData collection platforms in the form of buoys, free-floating balloons, and remote weather\nstations transmit their data on a 401.65 MHz uplink to the spacecraft. The Data Collection System (DES) measures environmental\nfactors such as atmospheric temperature\nand pressure and the velocity and direction of the ocean and wind currents. The Des\ncollects and processes these measurements\nfor on-board storage and subsequent transmission from the satellite.\nFor free-floating telemetry transmitters, the system determines the location within 5 km\n(3.1 mi) to 8 km (5.0 mi) and "float" velocity to an accuracy of I meter per second\n(mps).\nThe stored data is transmitted to the ground once per orbit. Subsequently,\nthe data is\nsent to the French Centre at the Centre National D\' Etudes Spatiales (CNES) in Toulouse,\nFrance and the Service Argos Facility in Lanham, Maryland, for processing, distribution\nto users, and storage for archival purposes.\n\nNOAA-L/9\n\nSPACECRAFT\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nThe spacecraft transmits tile instrument data to the ground for three primary functions:\nCommand and Data Acquisition (CDA), Direct Broadcast, and Search and Rescue.\nCOMMAND\n\nAND\n\nDATA\n\nHigh Resolution\n\nACQUISITION\nPicture Transmission\n\n(CDA)\n\nSTATION\n\n(HRPT)\n\nDOWNLINKS\n\n- Real-time\n\ntransmission\n\nto "users"\n\nof\n\ndata-video data carrier frequency of 1698, 1702.5, or 1707 MHz with a data rate of\n665.4 kilobits per second (kbps).

The recorded data is transmitted\n\nto the NOAA\n\nDOWNLINKS\n\nFor over 30 years, NOAA has freely and openly provided satellite data through direct\nbroadcast to users in the United States and in 100 other countries throughout the world.\nIn the United States, any commercial firm receiving data through\nprovide tailored products to customers and/or viewers.\n\ndirect readout\n\nmay\n\nThere are three types of direct broadcasting:\n(l) the real-time High Resolution Picture\nTransmission (HRPT), (2) the direct sounder broadcast (DSB), also referred to as the\nreal-time VHF beacon transmissions, and (3) the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT).\nHigh\n\nResolution\n\nPicture\n\nTransmission\n\n(HRPT)\n\nHRPT provides worldwide direct readout of full resolution spacecraft parameters and\ninstrument data to ground stations within the footprint of the NOAA polar orbiters. The\nHRPT service was originally designed to provide timely day and night sea surface temperature, ice, snow, and cloud cover information to diverse users, but applications have\nexpanded due to the proliferation of moderately priced equipment and software. HRPT\ntransmissions contain data from all instruments aboard the NOAA polar satellites. The\ndata stream includes information\nfrom the TIROS Information Processor (TIP) and\nfrom the AVHRR/3 providing\n\nfive of six channels\n\nat ! km (0.62 mi) resolution.\n\nThe TIP\n\ncontains spacecraft attitude data, time codes, housekeeping,\nand low rate instrument\nscience data from the HIRS/3, SEM, DCS/2, and the SBUV. The AMSU-A, AMSUA l, AMSU-A2, and AMSU-B are also included in HRPT from the AMSU Information\nProcessor\n\n(AIP).\n\nTo receive the data, users can purchase the necessary equipment (computer, software,\nantenna) from commercial\ncompanies for unlimited access to the HRPT signals. In\n1996, there were 541 HRPT receivers worldwide who were registered with the World\nMeteorological\n\nOrganization\n\n(WMO).\n\nNOAA-IJ11\n\nI\n\nDirect\n\nSounder\n\nBroadcasting\n\nVery high frequency\n\n(DSB)\n\n(VHF) beacon transmission\n\nis available to users who do not intend\n\nto install the more complex equipment necessary to receive high data rate S-band service. The lower data rates permit the user to install less complex, less costly equipment\nto receive the data (HIRS/3, SEM-2, DCS/2, but not AMSU.)\nParallel outputs are provided for the DSB real-time VHF beacon transmission and for\nthe Manipulated\nInformation Rate Processor (MIRP) HRPT S-band links. The instrument data is multiplexed with analog and digital housekeeping\ndata. The TIP output\ndirectly modulates the beacon transmission. The data is transmitted as an 8.32 kbps split\nphase signal over one of the beacon transmitters at 137.35 MHz and 137.77 MHz.\nAutomated\n\nPicture\n\nTransmission\n\n(APT)\n\nData\n\nAPT is smoothed 4-km (2.5 mi) resolution IR and visible imagery derived from the\nAVHRR/3 instrument and transmitted within the footprint of the NOAA polar orbiters.\nSince APT is captured on low-cost VHF ground stations, it is also very popular in\nschools. Users purchase the necessary equipment (computer, software, antenna) from\ncommercial companies for unlimited access to APT signals. In 1996, there were 2,296\nAPT receivers worldwide registered with the WMO.\nAny two of the five AVHRR channels provided to the MIRP can be selected and\nprocessed as "Video A" and "Video B." One APT line, consisting of one line of Video\nA and one line of Video B, is output every third AVHRR scan. Ancillary AVHRR data\nappears at one edge of each line and their 64-second repetition period defines the APT\nframe length. The resulting line rate is two per second. The data is transmitted continuously over a dedicated VHF link as an analog signal consisting of an amplitude-modulated 2400-Hz subcarrier frequency modulating the RF carrier at 137.50 MHz or 137.62\nMHz.\nSEARCH\n\nAND\n\nRESCUE\n\nDOWNLINKS\n\nFor information\nabout SAR, please refer to the previous\nRescue Instruments\nthat begins on page NOAA-L/8.\n\n+section\n\ntitled Search\n\nand\n+i\n\nr,\n\nNOAA-L/12\n\nPOLAR OPERATIONAL\nSATELLITE PRODUCTS\n\nENVIRONMENTAL\n\nThe NOAA polar operational environmental satellites collect global data on cloud cover;\nsurface conditions such as ice, snow, and vegetation; atmospheric temperatures,\nand\nmoisture, aerosol, and ozone distributions, and collect and relay information from fixed\nand moving data platforms.

The Titan II SLV consists of\na Titan H intercontinental\nballistic missile that has been converted to an SLV configuration through the extensive use of\ntechnology and hardware developed during the Titan Ill and\nIV programs. It is capable of placing 5,000 Ibs (2,268 kg)\ninto a polar low-Earth orbit.\nThe Titan II SLV is 34.75 m (114 It) tall and 3.05 in (10 It) in\ndiameter. Its trisector payload fairing is 6.1 m (20 It) long\nand 3.05 m (10 ft) in diameter. A 1.392-m (54.8-in) diameter conical adapter fitting fastens the NOAA-L spacecraft\nto the launch vehicle. The fairing attached to the forward\nface of the launch vehicle protects the spacecraft during\nflight. The Titan II SLV is a two-stage liquid fueled vehicle.\nEach stage employs a hypergolic fuel -- "Aerozine 50" [50\npercent hydrazine, 50 percent unsymmetrical\ndimethylhydrazine (UDMH)] and a nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer which\nare pressurized with dry nitrogen.\nIn-flight guidance is provided by an on-board inertial guidance system (IGS) that is also used on the Titan IV launch\nvehicle. The IGS is located on a structural truss between\nthe fuel and oxidizer tanks on Stage II. The IGS consists of\nan Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that contains a gimbaled\nplatform\n\nwith three integrating\n\ngyro accelerometers\n\nand a\n\nmissile guidance computer (MGC), which is a random access, thin film core memory, parallel, binary, digital computer.\nThe IGS\ntem.

The HIRS/2 and SSU instruments and the power subsystems operate satisfactorily. In September 1994, the AVHRR scan motor failed, leaving the\ninstrument inoperative. In October 1994, the SBUV/2 diffuser failed; however, the instrument\ncontinues to collect global ozone data. In April 1995, DTRs 1B and 5A/B failed to operate. Two\ngyros have failed and attitude control is being maintained through the use of new reduced gyro\nflight software. In addition, before the NOAA-D launch, a gyrolessflight software package was\ninstalled on NOAA-11 to provide attitude control, at expected reduced accuracy, should the Xgyro fail. The satellite was placed in standby mode in March 1995, and was reactivated to\nprovide soundings after a NOAA-12 HIRS filter wheel anomaly in May 1997. The MSU stopped\nscanning in February 1999. The MSU science data is no longer usable, so the instrument was\npowered off in March 1999.\nNOAA-D (12) was launched on May 14, 1991, into a 450-nmi momm_ orbit and is currently the\nsemi-operational backup morning satellite.

All attempts to\ncontact or command the spacecraft since the power failure have been unsuccessful.\nNOA.&-J (14) was launched on December 30, 1994, into a 470-nmi afternoon orbit and is currently-designated as the operational afternoon satellite. A few hours after launch, a GN 2 regulator valve\nleak caused the spacecraft to experience an attitude anomaly. The satellite was recovered within\nhours and remains in a stable orbit. In January 1995, it was determined that one of the four Space\nEnvironment Monitor (SEM) telescopes was inoperative, reducing data collected by 12 percent.\nIn February 1995, the SARP failed, the SBUV/2 Cloud Cover Radiometer (CCR) failed, and DTR\n4A/4B was deemed inoperable. Also, the ESA exhibited high Quadrant 3 (Q3) data counts due to\napparent contamination of the detector. In March 1995, the MSU scanner seized and the instrument was powered off. After three weeks, the MSU was powered on and has been operating\nsatisfactorily since. Flight software was modified in April 1995, to correct the high ESA Q3 counts\nand to turn off the MSU should the scanner seize up again. Between April 1995 and December\n1996 the SBUV grating drive experienced significant degradation. The grating drive control was\nreprogrammed to compensate for these problems as well as for the CCR failure. All other instruments operate satisfactorily. In November 1995, the Demodulator portion of the Command Receiver and Demodulator (CRD) for On-board Processor #1 (OBPI) failed, resulting in the loss of\nthe backup OBP. OBP1 was commanded off. Flight software and ground software packages were\nmodified to permit the use of and commanding to only OBP2. Currently, it is planned for NOAA-L\n(16) to replace NOAA-J (14) as the operational afternoon satellite.\nNOAA-K (15) was launched on May 13, 1998, into a 450-nmi morning orbit and is currently the\ndesignated operational morning satellite. It replaced NOAA-D (12) on December 14, 1998, as the\nprimary morning spacecraft. The STX-1, STX-2, and STX-3 high-gain S-band antennas have\nshown degraded performance in orbit. Beginning September 28, 1999, the satellite was configured\nto transmit HRPT using the STX-2 omnidirectional antenna and transmit data playbacks using\nSTX-4. The STX-1 and STX-3 downlinks are not Used_Since the NOAA-15 launch, the A1VI-SU,B\ninstrument has had a bias in the science data that has been corrected by software processing on\nthe ground. This bias is caused by interference from the S-band transmit systems on-board the\nspacecraft. With the use of the omnidirectional antennas and only the STX-2 and STX-4 S-band\ndownlinks, the interference can be modeled to remove the bias to the science data. Instruments\non NOAA-L and later spacecraft have been modified to correct this bias.\n\n-\n\nNOAA-L/24\n\nAppendix\n\nA\nHIRS/3\n\nChannel\nChannel\n\nFrequency\n\nChannel\n\nHalf Power\nmicron\n\n(cm-\')\n\nBandwidth\n(cm-\')\n\nCharacteristics\n\nAnticipated\nMax.
