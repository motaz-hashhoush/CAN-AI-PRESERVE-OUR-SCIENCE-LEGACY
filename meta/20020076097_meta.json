EPOCH 2000, which allows ground operators to monitor and control satellites over a wide area network, owes part of its heritage from work completed to support Goddard Space Flight Center. The software automates telemetry processing, commanding, anomaly detection, and archiving collected data. The NEAR spacecraft, launched in February 1996, will rendezvous in early 1999 and orbit the Asteroid Eros for a year. Integral Systems also provided Low Earth Orbit Autonomous Ground Terminals (LEO-Ts) to NASA. The LEO-T is designed to make it easier and less expensive for principal investigators to obtain telemetry, tracking and control services for their science missions. The company products have supported well over 70 satellite missions aimed at scientific research, meteorology, or communications applications.", "title": "Managing Satellites", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076097, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076097, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "25619b27b6834518ade40edd70b2364e", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970041341, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1997: 25 Years of Reporting Down-to-Earth Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076097.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076097/downloads/20020076097.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076097/downloads/20020076097.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076097/downloads/20020076097.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
