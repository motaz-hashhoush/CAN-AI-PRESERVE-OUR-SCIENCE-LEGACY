With gravitational effects taken into account, a new solution to the fuel optimal vertical landing on an asteroid was obtained. In this solution, the spacecraft commanded acceleration is explicitly expressed as a function of vehicle velocity and time to go. Based on qualitative methods of analysis, the guidance strategy and the resulting trajectories were studied. It is shown that these fuel-optimal trajectories effectively assure a vertical soft landing on the asteroid. Results of numerical simulations for the vertical landing, starting from an elliptical orbit are presented.", "title": "Vertical landing on an asteroid", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T13:34:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960009736, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harel, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Technion - Israel Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Haifa, Israel"}}, "id": "c8f8cc3a9b7f474c9ea176885b8f65a6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960009736, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Geulman, M."}, "organization": {"name": "Rafael Armament Development Authority", "location": "Haifa, Israel"}}, "id": "3620472b09d1444c96b13666499e09ca"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960009736, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960009736, "id": "b65a0aa46a444a02a2afe67c4cc933d6", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Civilian Space Applications", "publicationDate": "1992-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
