The containment cartridge contains an ampoule of toxic material therein and is positioned within a furnace for processing. An ampoule failure probe is positioned in the containment cartridge adjacent the ampoule for detecting a potential harmful release of toxic material therefrom during processing. The failure probe is spaced a predetermined distance from the ampoule and is chemically chosen so as to undergo a timely chemical reaction with the toxic material upon the harmful release thereof. The ampoule failure system further comprises a data acquisition system which is positioned externally of the furnace and is electrically connected to the ampoule failure probe so as to form a communicating electrical circuit. The data acquisition system includes an automatic shutdown device for shutting down the furnace upon the harmful release of toxic material. It also includes a resistance measuring device for measuring the resistance of the failure probe during processing. The chemical reaction causes a step increase in resistance of the failure probe whereupon the automatic shutdown device will responsively shut down the furnace.", "title": "Ampoule Failure System", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T15:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19970026202, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Watring, Dale A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "46d1f316bc834a8fbd2675ea10adc2ea"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19970026202, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Martin L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL United States"}}, "id": "58a9206f52734e81b6fc36ddb7e5d8a1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19970026202, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970026202, "id": "f7e540245b6f47979d01b9cc8d7fb9ee", "publicationDate": "1996-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970026202.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970026202/downloads/19970026202.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970026202/downloads/19970026202.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970026202/downloads/19970026202.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
