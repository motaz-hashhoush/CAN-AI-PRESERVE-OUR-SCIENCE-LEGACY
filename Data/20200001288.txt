The program\nmatures capabilities needed for NASA missions\nand commercial applications while strategically\ninvesting in the growth of the U.S. commercial\nspaceflight industry. These flight tests take\ntechnologies from ground-based laboratories into\nrelevant environments to increase technology\nreadiness and validate feasibility while reducing\nthe costs and technical risks of future missions.\n\nFlight Highlights\n\nLEVERAGING NEW VEHICLES FOR RAPID\nTESTING AND REFLIGHT\n\nENABLING SAFE AND PRECISE\nPAYLOAD RECOVERY\n\nFACILITATING RAPID SAMPLE RETURN\nFROM LOW-EARTH ORBIT\n\nA guided parafoil system for payload recovery was successfully tested in\nFY2019.

Credit: NASA\n\nAirborne Systems North America tested a precision\npayload recovery experiment on two high-altitude\nballoon flights from World View Enterprises on April 9 and\nSeptember 22, 2019. The flights demonstrated the ability\nof a guided parafoil to navigate to a logistically accessible\nrecovery zone and potentially improve midair retrieval\nof reusable rocket components and payloads returning\nto Earth.\n\nOn August 29, 2019, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames Research Center\ntested its exo-atmospheric aerobrake technology on a\nhigh-altitude balloon flight from Raven Aerostar above\nSioux Falls, South Dakota. The payload is a passive reentry/deorbit device designed to enable quick sample\nreturn from the International Space Station and other\norbital outposts. Notably, the flight marked the first for\nRaven as a commercial provider for Flight Opportunities.\n\nTesting performed\nwith commercial flight\nproviders in fiscal\nyear 2019 (FY2019)\nhighlights the impact\nthat rapid testing and\nreflight can have on\nincreasing the speed\nand effectiveness of the\ntechnology development\nprocess. In addition,\nmany technologies\nthat are poised to\nhelp NASA achieve\nkey mission goals\nwere able to achieve\nnotable maturation\nmilestones during\ntheir flights this year.\n\nVehicles from Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin demonstrated rapid testing and reflight for several Flight\nOpportunities\xe2\x80\x93supported technologies on three successive launches over three months in early\nFY2019. Credits: Blue Origin (left), Virgin Galactic (right)\n\nBetween December 2018 and February 2019, 17 Flight Opportunities\xe2\x80\x93\nsupported payloads were tested on three flights conducted by Virgin\nGalactic and Blue Origin. These three successful flights in a short threemonth timeframe represent the long-awaited emergence of two high-fidelity\ncommercial suborbital platforms for testing program-supported payloads.\nNotably, these flights included:\nl\t Virgin Galactic\xe2\x80\x99s first two flights for Flight Opportunities,\nboth on SpaceShipTwo\nl\t Blue Origin\xe2\x80\x99s first dedicated launch of its New Shepard\nrocket for NASA payloads\nThe flights carried a series of space exploration and utilization technologies,\nincluding research that could aid the ability of future missions to mitigate the\nimpact of lunar surface dust on humans and equipment, separate gas and\nliquid for in situ resource processing and on-orbit fuel transfer, and understand\nhow to help plants thrive in space as a resource for sustained human activity\non the Moon and beyond. Many of the payloads were flown multiple times\nand on both vehicles, underscoring the benefit of gathering data on different\nflight platforms and exhibiting the potential for rapid testing and reflight of\ntechnologies.\n[2]\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuborbital flights enable researchers to quickly and iteratively test technologies with the opportunity to\nmake adjustments between flights. The ultimate goal is to change the pace of technology development\nand drastically shorten the time it takes to bring an idea from the lab to orbit or to the Moon.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 Christopher Baker, Program Executive, Flight Opportunities\n[3]\n\nFlight Highlights\n\nADVANCING LUNAR AND PLANETARY NAVIGATION\n\nMATURING LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES FOR ON-ORBIT EMERGENCIES\nOn May 2, 2019, Blue Origin\nconducted a successful suborbital\nflight of its New Shepard rocket with\n38 payloads on board, including nine\nthat were developed or sponsored\nby NASA. The payloads included\na gravity-independent chest tube\ndrainage system from Orbital\nMedicine that could be used to\ntreat a collapsed lung in space (a\npotentially fatal injury likely to occur\nduring a decompression event). This\ntechnology could also be applied in\nmilitary or civilian medevac or other\nemergency medical situations where\ncurrent gravity-dependent systems\nare in danger of being knocked over.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have these\nintegrated field tests, a lot\nof new precision landing\ntechnologies might still be\nsitting in a lab or on paper,\nbeing deemed too risky for\nflight. This gives us the very\nnecessary opportunity to get the\ndata we need, make revisions,\nand build insight and confidence\ninto how these technologies\nwill perform on a spacecraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94 John M.

Credit: NASA\n\nOn September 11, 2019, Draper\ntested the performance of a terrainrelative navigation system on\nMasten Space Systems\xe2\x80\x99 Xodiac\nrocket. The goal: to demonstrate the\ntechnology\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify land\nfeatures in real time and characterize\nnavigation performance, which will\nbe critical for landing on the Moon or\nMars. This capability would improve\na lander\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of where it is\nand where there is a safe place to\ntouch down. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s work to develop\nthis and related technologies\n\nfalls under the Safe and Precise\nLanding\xe2\x80\x93Integrated Capabilities\nEvolution (SPLICE) project.\nDraper also leveraged balloon\nflights with World View Enterprises\non April 9 and September 22,\n2019, to gather valuable data in the\nhigh-altitude descent regime for\nanother aspect of its portfolio of\nentry, descent, and landing (EDL)\ntechnologies: a vision navigation\nsolution known as the Draper MultiEnvironment Navigator. Draper has\n[4]\n\nleveraged NASA-sponsored flights\non several vehicles through Flight\nOpportunities, enabling researchers\nto test their EDL technologies at a\nvariety of altitudes and conditions\nto help ensure that the systems\ncan successfully execute a landing\non the Moon or Mars. Draper\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork resulted in the selection of its\nNavigation Doppler Lidar technology\nto fly to the Moon on a future NASA\nCommercial Lunar Payload Services\n(CLPS) flight.\n[5]\n\nTechnology Transitions\n\nARTEMIS AND COMMERCIAL LUNAR PAYLOAD\nSERVICES SELECTIONS\nAs technologies are\nmatured through flight\ntests, they climb the\ntechnology readiness\nladder, often transitioning\nto orbital testing\n\nIn FY2019, NASA selected science and technology experiments to fly to\nthe Moon on future NASA Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)\nflights in support of the Artemis program. The technologies highlighted\nbelow* were matured in part through commercial flight tests facilitated by\nFlight Opportunities.\nIn addition, three Flight Opportunities participants are eligible to bid on\nNASA delivery services to the lunar surface through CLPS contracts:\nAstrobotic Technology, Blue Origin, and Masten Space Systems.\n\nopportunities or inclusion\nin NASA missions. In\nFY2019, several Flight\nOpportunities\xe2\x80\x93supported\ntechnologies realized\nsuch success.\nSuccessful Flight Opportunities\xe2\x80\x93supported tests of PlanetVac, which is\ndesigned to attach to the leg of a lander vehicle (as shown here), helped the\ntechnology be selected for Artemis as part of a CLPS mission.\nCredit: Honeybee Robotics\n\nPlanetVac\nSwRI investigators tested methods for conducting electric and magnetic field measurements of\nplanetary interiors on commercial flights, including the one shown here on a World View Enterprises\nballoon. These tests helped the SwRI team develop a new instrument that was selected for Artemis.\nCredit: Earth Science Systems\n\nLunar Magnetotelluric Sounder\nSouthwest Research Institute (SwRI) (PI: Robert Grimm)\n\nBased on technology tested through the Flight Opportunities program, SwRI\xe2\x80\x99s\nsounder is designed to characterize the structure and composition of the\nMoon\xe2\x80\x99s mantle by studying its electric and magnetic fields. Selected by NASA\nfor a lunar investigation, the sounder will employ a flight-spare magnetometer,\noriginally made for the MAVEN spacecraft, which is currently orbiting Mars.\n*Draper\xe2\x80\x99s Navigation Doppler Lidar technology was also selected for a future CLPS flight.\nSee story on page 4.\n\n[6]\n\nFlights facilitated by Flight Opportunities, including on high-altitude balloons\nand rockets, helped mature the RadSat technology (shown at the recovery\nstage after a World View Enterprises balloon flight) for Artemis selection.\nCredit: World View Enterprises\n\nReconfigurable, Radiation-Tolerant\nComputer System\n\nHoneybee Robotics (PI: Kris Zacny)\n\nPlanetVac\xe2\x80\x94a pneumatic suction device designed to\ncollect regolith for subsequent analysis\xe2\x80\x94will be used\non one of the landers being developed under the CLPS\ncontracts. The device\xe2\x80\x99s ability to quickly and efficiently\ngather regolith was well demonstrated on flights\nfacilitated by Flight Opportunities.\n\nMontana State University (PI: Brock LaMeres)\n\nRadiation-tolerant computing will be needed on the\nMoon, where the lack of atmosphere as well as the\nmagnetic field and radiation from the Sun will be a\nchallenge for most terrestrial electronics. This lunar\ndemonstration will further test the computer system\nmatured in part through Flight Opportunities and will\nalso help characterize the radiation effects on the\nMoon\xe2\x80\x99s surface\xe2\x80\x94a critical need for understanding\nlong-term impact on human explorers and equipment.\n\nRead more about the selections online\nVisit https://go.usa.gov/xdBRK and https://go.usa.gov/xdBR5\n[7]\n\nTechnology Transitions\n\nMATERIALS INTERNATIONAL SPACE\nSTATION EXPERIMENT SELECTIONS\n\nOTHER MISSIONS AND\nCOLLABORATIVE EXPERIMENTS\n\nThe Structural Health Monitoring for Commercial Space\nVehicles technology from the New Mexico Institute\nof Mining and Technology (Andrei Zagrai and Anders\nJorgensen, co-investigators) was selected for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nnext Materials International Space Station Experiment\n(MISSE) mission. MISSE sends material samples to the\nInternational Space Station for a minimum research\nperiod of one year, enabling materials under investigation\nfor long-term use in space to be exposed to the harsh\nspace environment for testing and evaluation. This\nselected technology is designed to provide an integral\npart of a flight information recorder (commonly known\nas the black box), gathering and storing data on its\nstructural integrity during all stages of spaceflight.\n\nSeveral technologies matured through Flight\nOpportunities received additional NASA funding for\nfurther suborbital or orbital testing beyond the program,\nincluding experiments on the International Space Station,\nand on both NASA and commercial vehicles. Recent\nhighlights of these types of infusions include:\n\nFlights on commercial vehicles, including ZERO-G\xe2\x80\x99s parabolic aircraft,\nhelped prepare this thermal management experiment for an International\nSpace Station mission.

Credit: UP Aerospace\n\nData from multiple commercial suborbital flights is\nhelping inform the experiment design for a NASA-funded\nlong-term investigation on the International Space\nStation as early as 2021. Researchers are hoping to\ndevelop enhanced thermal management capabilities by\ninvestigating the effects of gravity on the electric forces\ngoverning heat flux acquisition and fluid management.\n\n[8]\n\nUniversity of Florida investigators\nhave been conducting biological\ninvestigations on plants in\nmicrogravity for 20 years,\nincluding on many parabolic\nflights such as the one shown\nhere.
