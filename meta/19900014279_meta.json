The ICLS was designed to augment the capabilities of the current Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), providing a data rate capacity large enough to accommodate the expected rates for user satellites (USAT's) in the post-1995 timeframe. Two methods of data relay on-board the planned TDAS (Tracking and Data Acquisition) satellites are described. One is an all-baseband system with a bi-directional 2 Gbps data stream; the other is a channelized crosslink system wherein some of the channels are baseband and others are merely frequency translated before re-transmission. The general system and technology design drivers are outlined along with the acquisition architecture design. Descriptions of the TDAS antenna, transmitter, receiver, and mechanical hardware are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900014279, "id": "efa199bdaafa420ba85ed56affcdfbae", "publicationDate": "1986-06-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900014279.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900014279/downloads/19900014279.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900014279/downloads/19900014279.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900014279/downloads/19900014279.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
