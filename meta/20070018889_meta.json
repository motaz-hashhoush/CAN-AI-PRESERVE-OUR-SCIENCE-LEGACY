The program was undertaken in 1975, after a series of disastrous fires on oil tankers indicated a need for a lightweight, self-contained system that could be moved quickly to the scene of a fire. A prototype module was delivered to the Coast Guard last year and service testing is under way. The compact module weighs little more than a ton but it contains everything needed to fight a fire. The key component is a high output pump, which delivers up to 2,000 gallons of sea water a minute; the pump can be brought up to maximum output in only one minute after turning on the power source, a small Allison gas turbine engine. The module also contains hose, a foam nozzle and a spray nozzle, three sets of protective clothing for firefighters, and fuel for three hours operation. Designed to be assembled without special tools, the module can be set up for operation in less than 20 minutes.", "title": "Firefighting Module", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T22:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070018889, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070018889, "id": "125b38de43d646ab9054b0e923a6ab14", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1978", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070018873, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1978", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070018889.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070018889/downloads/20070018889.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070018889/downloads/20070018889.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070018889/downloads/20070018889.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
