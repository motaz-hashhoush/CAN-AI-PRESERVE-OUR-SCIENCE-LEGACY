b"Minimizing Human Risk: Human Performance Models in\nthe Human Factors and Behavioral Performance Element\nBrian F. Gore1\n1\n\nNASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035-0001\nBrian.F.Gore@nasa.gov\n\nAbstract. Human space exploration has never been more exciting than it is today. Human presence to outer worlds is becoming a reality as humans are leveraging much of our prior knowledge to the new mission of going to Mars. Exploring the solar system at greater distances from Earth than ever before will\npossess some unique challenges, which can be overcome thanks to the advances\nin modeling and simulation technologies. The National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) is at the forefront of exploring our solar system.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Research Program (HRP) focuses on discovering the best\nmethods and technologies that support safe and productive human space travel\nin the extreme and harsh space environment. HRP uses various methods and\napproaches to answer questions about the impact of long duration missions on\nthe human in space including: gravity\xe2\x80\x99s impact on the human body, isolation\nand confinement on the human, hostile environments impact on the human,\nspace radiation, and how the distance is likely to impact the human. Predictive\nmodels are included in the HRP research portfolio as these models provide valuable insights into human-system operations. This paper will provide an overview of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s HRP and will present a number of projects that have used\nmodeling and simulation to provide insights into human-system issues (e.g. automation, habitat design, schedules) in anticipation of space exploration.\nKeywords: Space Human Factors & Behavioral Performance \xc2\xb7 Human Performance \xc2\xb7 Human-Systems Integration \xc2\xb7 Systems Engineering \xc2\xb7 Modeling and\nSimulation\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe United States\xe2\x80\x99 Department of Defense (US DoD) and the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration (NASA) put humans in extreme and hostile environments\nand require the human to perform optimally in order to successfully accomplish mission goals. Sub-optimal performance in the US DoD and NASA missions has the\npotential to increase the risks of not completing the mission successfully. A variety of\nmethods to predict human-system vulnerabilities are needed to effectively manage\nsuch risks.\nOur nation\xe2\x80\x99s space program has grown in sophistication and ambition over the recent\npast. The NASA Human Research Program (HRP) is the result of efforts undertaken\n\nby the agency to refocus its efforts on space exploration from the efforts of the Constellation program. The US space program has transitioned from one that focused on\ncompleting the International Space Station, to returning to the Moon, to crewed flight\nto the planet Mars, to one of exploration at greater distances and longer durations\nfrom planet Earth with the goal of traveling to Mars and beyond. This focus on exploration has changed the activities that NASA has been undertaking to include activities beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) over a longer duration. The NASA Programs responsible for insuring that success will be attained include the management of Commercial Space Transportation, Exploration Systems Development, Human Space\nFlight Capabilities, Advanced Exploration Systems, Research and Technology, and\nOperations.\n\n2\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Research Program\n\nThe Human Research Program (HRP) resides under NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Research and Technology program. The goal of the HRP is to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration [1]. The HRP and its researchers are working to develop\ncapabilities, necessary countermeasures, and technologies to support human space\nexploration, focusing on mitigating the highest risks to crew health and performance\nand documenting these findings in guidelines and standards. In addition, HRP seeks to\ndevelop technologies that serve to reduce medical and environmental risks, to reduce\nhuman systems resource requirements (mass, volume, power, data, etc.), and to ensure\neffective human-system integration across exploration mission systems. HRP ensures\nmaintenance of Agency core competencies necessary to enable risk reduction in the\nfollowing areas: space medicine; physiological and behavioral effects of longduration spaceflight on the human body; space environmental effects (including radiation) on human health and performance; and space human factors. The HRP and its\nresearchers are working to improve astronauts' ability to collect data, solve problems,\nrespond to emergencies, and remain healthy during and after extended space travel.\nInvestigators in HRP work to predict, assess, and solve the problems that humans\nencounter in space through national and international assets and collaborations.\n2.1\n\nNASA HRP Structure\n\nAs of February 1, 2017, HRP is made up of five elements: Human Factors and Behavioral Performance, Human Health Countermeasures, Space Radiation, Exploration\nMedical Capability, and Space International Space Station Medical Project. The five\nElements are aimed at exploring many facets of human space travel including Environmental Factors, Exercise Physiology, Habitability, Human Factors, Medical Capabilities, Physiology, Psychosocial and Behavioral Health, and Space Radiation. The\nHRP\xe2\x80\x99s five elements enable scientists and engineers work to predict, assess, and solve\nthe problems that humans encounter in space.\nThe HRP and its five elements use a risk reduction strategy based on a medical\nmodel to guide the research that is to be conducted. The HRP focuses its research\n\ninvestment on investigating and mitigating the highest risks to astronaut health and\nperformance in support of exploration missions. This process describes evidence as\nthe basis for the existence of a risk to the human system, gaps in our knowledge about\ncharacterizing or mitigating the risk, and the tasks that need to be carried out in order\nto produce the deliverables needed to close the gaps and reduce the risk. The evidence\nfor the existence of the risk is documented in the risk Evidence Reports, the gaps in\nknowledge represent the questions that need to be answered to mitigate the risk, the\ntasks characterize the risk or develop mitigation capabilities to reduce the risk to an\nacceptable level, and deliverables culminate in the final product (standards, guidelines, countermeasures). HRP relies on Design Reference Missions (DRMs), which\nprovide a framework to identify key capabilities and important guiding drivers and\nassumptions, thus enabling the HRP to focus its research questions on topics highly\nrelevant to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future activities. The exploration missions currently considered\ninclude the International Space Station (ISS), lunar, near Earth objects/asteroids, and\nMars missions [1].\n2.2\n\nMethods Used to Minimize Human Exploration Risks\n\nThe multiple lines of critical research that needs to be undertaken by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s HRP\nrequire that a suite of approaches be used to predict the impact of the complex, long\nduration mission on the human, and on the human\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform. Ground research occurs in laboratories and analogs that simulate a portion of the spaceflight\nenvironment. The International Space Station (ISS) is used to conduct research requiring the unique environment of space, and for validating some of the results from\nground-based studies. NASA has also adopted the NASA-STD-3001 to establish a\nbroad set of criteria that ensures that humans are healthy, safe, and productive in\nspace. The approaches used to meet these criteria need to include both the concerns\nfrom the human physiology and medical procedures and standards for maintenance\nand preservation of health, as well as the \xe2\x80\x98systems\xe2\x80\x99 perspective. Specifically, systems\nthat interface with the human: controls, displays, architecture, environment, and habitability support systems. NASA uses a variety of methods to optimize designs for all\ncrew operations both inside and outside the spacecraft in space and on lunar and planetary surfaces. The charter of the Human Factors and Behavioral Performance\n(HFBP) Element is to perform the research and technology development to support\ngeneration of human factors standards and guidelines for human-system hardware,\nsoftware, procedures, and spacecraft designs as well as to conduct and support research to reduce the risk of behavioral and psychiatric conditions. All of the HFBP\nresearch feeds documentation, guidelines, validation of environmental impacts on the\nhuman, and HFBP standards within NASA-STD-3001, NASA Space Flight Human\nSystems Standard, Vol. 2, and the Human Integration Design Handbook [2,3]. The\nHFBP Element is subdivided into the Human Factors, the Sleep/BMED, and Team\nportfolios. Each of these portfolios is guided by a series of risk statements.\n\n2.3\n\nHRP Risk Statements\n\nSix risk statements exist within HRP\xe2\x80\x99s HFBP HF Portfolio and serve to guide the\nresearch that is completed in order to optimize human performance in space [4]. The\nrisk statements under the HF Portfolio follow.\nRisk of Incompatible Vehicle/Habitat Design (HAB). Given that vehicle, habitat, and\nworkspace designs must accommodate variations in human physical characteristics\nand capabilities, and given that the duration of crew habitation in these space-based\nenvironments will be far greater than mission of the past, there is a risk of acute and\nchronic ergonomics-related disorders, resulting in flight and ground crew errors and\ninefficiencies, failed mission and program objectives, and an increase in the potential\nfor crew injuries.\nRisk of Inadequate Design of Human and Automation/Robotic Integration (HARI).\nGiven that automation and robotics must seamlessly integrate with crew, and given\nthe greater dependence on automation and robotics in the context of long duration\nspaceflight operations, there is a risk that systems will be inadequately designed, resulting in flight and ground crew errors and inefficiencies, failed mission and an increase in crew injuries.\nRisk of Performance Errors due to Training Deficiencies (TRAIN). Given that existing training methods and paradigms may inadequately prepare long-duration, autonomous crews to execute their mission, there is a risk that increased flight and ground\ncrew inefficiencies, failed mission and program objectives, and increased crew injuries will occur.\nRisk of Inadequate Mission, Process, and Task Design (MPTASK). Given that tasks,\nschedules, and procedures must accommodate human capabilities and limitations, and\ngiven that ling-duration crews will experience physical and cognitive changes and\nincreased autonomy, there is a risk that tasks, schedules, and procedures will be developed without considering the human condition, resulting in increased workload,\nflight and ground crew errors and inefficiencies, failed mission and program objectives and an increase in crew injuries.\nRisk of Inadequate Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Given that human-computer\ninteraction and information architecture designs must support crew tasks, and given\nthe grater dependence on HCI in the context of long-duration spaceflight operations,\nthere is a risk that critical information systems will not support crew tasks effectively,\nresulting in flight and ground crew errors and inefficiencies, failed mission and program objectives, and an increase in crew injuries.\nRisk of Injury from Dynamic Loads (OP). Given the range of anticipated dynamic\nloads transferred to the crew via the vehicle, there is a possibility of loss of crew or\ncrew injury during launch, abort, and landing.\nBoth empirical and computational approaches have been used iteratively to reduce the\nimpact of risks to human exploration. N\n\n3\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human Research Program Use of Modeling and\nSimulation\n\nModeling and simulation (M&S) techniques play an integral role when complex human-system notions are being proposed, developed, and tested. NASA Johnston\nSpace Center (JSC) utilizes M&S to represent environments, physical structures and\nequipment components, crew stations, planets and planetary motions, gravitational\neffects, illumination, human anthropometric and biomechanics. NASA Ames Research Center utilizes M&S capabilities for airflows, flight paths (e.g., Airspace Concept Evaluation System-ACES), aircrafts, schedules (e.g., Core-XPRT, Science Planning InterFace to engineering \xe2\x80\x93 SPIFe, Playbook), human performance prediction\n(HPMs; e.g. MIDAS), and bioinformatics. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s HFBP currently uses a number of\nthese M&S approaches to estimate many aspects critical in the human research\nroadmap (HRR) in the respective risk\xe2\x80\x99s Path to Risk Reduction (PRR) [5].\nSeven HRP HFBP (formerly the SHFH and BHP Elements) projects currently underway (or recently completed) serve to reduce gaps in knowledge in the habitability,\ntask design, human automation and robotics integration, and the behavioral performance sleep risks illustrate the manner that M&S approaches have been used to inform the respective risk.\n3.1\n\nComputational Model for Spacecraft/Habitat Volume\n\nThe Computational Model for Spacecraft/Habitat Volume task set out to create a \xe2\x80\x9cbottoms-up\xe2\x80\x9d method based on mission attributes and critical task volumes better align\nwith a human-centered design philosophy than the top-down approach that is commonly used [6]. The objective of this ongoing work is to develop a constraint-driven,\noptimization-based model that can be used to estimate and evaluate spacecraft/habitat\nvolume. The computational model development aims to: Estimate spacecraft/habitat\nvolume based on mission parameters and constraints, provide layout assumptions for\na given volume, assess volumes based on a set of performance metrics, and inform\nrisk characteristics associated with a volume. The outcome of this work will provide\ndata to support the HFBP-HAB-09 Gap on technologies, tools, and methods for data\ncollection, modeling, and analysis for design and assessment of vehicles/habitats. This\nongoing work is expected to continue through 2017.\n3.2\n\nA Tool for Automated Collection of Space Utilization Data\n\nThe tool for automated collection of space utilization data task is designed to develop\ninnovative methods to unobtrusively collect detailed and high quality input data without impacting crew time or constraining missions [7]. The objective of this ongoing\nwork is to develop and validate an automated data collection system that delivers data\nuseful in the analysis of space utilization and vehicle habitability pertaining to crew\nactivities on the ISS as well as potential long duration space missions. The investigation utilizes two independent technologies, 3D RFID-Real Time Location System\n(RTLS) and Microsoft Kinect 3D volumetric and anatomical scanning tools, and inte-\n\ngrates them into a single data collection and integration solution. The project advances the integrated system through a validation exercise that uses the HRP Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) platform. The significance of this task is that it\nwill provide NASA with a quantitative methodology for collecting data 3D space\nutilization data that is validated for use in flight analogs and has potential direct applicability for use in in-flight environments. The outcome of this research will provide\nhuman performance data to support the needs of the HFBP\xe2\x80\x99s Risk of Incompatible\nVehicle/Habitat Design and the associated HF portfolio gap HAB-05: We need to\nidentify technologies, tools, and methods for data collection, modeling, and analysis\nthat are appropriate for design and assessment of vehicle/habitats by creating a capability to automatically collect space utilization and other habitation-related questions,\nquestions that need to be answered as the mission lengths increase to months-long\ndurations.\n3.3\n\nHuman \xe2\x80\x93 Automation Interactions and Performance Analysis of Lunar\nLander Supervisory Control\n\nThis task examined the complex interactions between the astronauts and the vehicle\nsystems and automation required to conduct safe and precise planetary landing tasks.\nThe task produced an integrated human-system model that includes representations of\nhuman attention, perception, decision-making, and action for use as an early-stage\nsimulation-based design tool for human-system integration in complex systems [8].\nThe case study was a piloted lunar landing task. There were four integrated specific\naims: (1) Perform a critical analysis of human operator-automation interactions and\ntask allocations, considering information requirements, decision making, and the selection of action; (2) Develop a closed-loop pilot-vehicle model, integrating vehicle\ndynamics and human performance models, and parametrically analyze and quantify\nsystem performance; (3) Conduct experiments in the Draper Laboratory fixed-base\nsimulator to validate critical parameters within the integrated pilot-vehicle model; (4)\nExtend the model to include the effect of spatial orientation and conduct experiments\non the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) to\ninvestigate the effects of motion cues on pilot performance. The results of the VMS\nand Draper Laboratory experiments have been used to update the integrated humansystem model of the lunar lander. The model represents the cognitive processes and\naction responses of the human, who can act as both a flying pilot as well as a supervisory pilot. The model blocks have been updated in the Human Performance Model\n(HPM) library, and the integrated model has been used to run sensitivity analyses to\nthe effect of parameter variation on simulated system performance. The outcome of\nthis research provided research data to support the reduction of the HFBP\xe2\x80\x99s Risk of\nInadequate Mission, Process, and Task Design and the associated HF portfolio gap\nMPTASK-01: we need methods and tools to collect measures of mission, process, and\ntask performance.\n\n3.4\n\nMIDAS-FAST: Development and Validation of a Tool to Support\nFunction Allocation\n\nThe MIDAS-FAST1 project examined the impact that automation has on human manual control performance of a robotic asset, the International Space Station Mobile\nServicing System (Canadarm 2) [10]. Robotic manipulations are complex and often\ninvolve moving the arm in 7 degrees of freedom, with rotation up to 540 degrees,\noften possessing optimal camera viewing angles presented on the Advanced Space\nVision System screen that need to be set by the crewmember. \xe2\x80\x9cAutomation\xe2\x80\x9d has been\nproposed as a solution to assist the human guard against errors, which can have disastrous, potentially life threatening, consequences.\nThe MIDAS-FAST project uses human-performance models with a robotic simulation environment to evaluate the effects of function allocation strategies and task type\non operator and system performance in order to evaluate potential human-automation\ninteraction design issues. In this task, the research team 1) developed and validated a\nmodel- and simulation-based tool to allow researchers to evaluate various function\nallocation strategies in space robotics missions and 2) conducted empirical research to\ninvestigate human-automation interaction (HAI). The tool used the Man-Machine\nIntegration Design and Analysis System (MIDAS, a NASA Ames HPM tool) [11], the\nBasic Operational Robotics Instructional System (BORIS, a NASA Johnson Space\nCenter (JSC) training simulation [12], and the Frame of Reference Transformation\n(FORT) model. FORT was added to the operator model to identify the quality of\ncamera views and control-movement compatibility [13]. FORT contributes to the\noperator workload, calculated in the human performance software, MIDAS. MIDASFAST provides ways for the modeled operator to 1) receive and interpret data from\nBORIS, 2) assess their own performance as the task is carried out, and 3) adjust their\nbehavior based on FORT and external (BORIS-driven) stimuli.\nThe MIDAS-FAST task provided a validated model- and simulation-based tool for\npredicting operator performance when working with a robotic arm in different function allocation situations. The function allocation model, and the empirical research in\nthis effort were used to identify conditions and provide data to develop the tool. The\nMIDAS-FAST task has integrated the FORT, BORIS and MIDAS models and has\ndeveloped a combined user interface. The outcome of this research addressed HFBP\xe2\x80\x99s\nRisk of inadequate design of human and automation/robotic integration and the associated HF portfolio gap HARI-01 we need to evaluate, develop, and validate methods\nand guidelines for identifying human-automation/robot task information needs, function allocation, and team composition for future long duration, long distance space\nmissions [14].\n3.5\n\nModeling and mitigating spatial disorientation in low g environments\n\nThe goal of this task was to extend a spatial disorientation mitigation software developed for aeronautical use called Spatial Disorientation Analysis Tool (SDAT) to\nNASA's space applications (e.g. the Shuttle, crew exploration vehicle, Altair, and\n1\n\nThe MIDAS-FAST project arose from the workload monitoring and modeling task of the\nHRP SHFE portfolio from 2008-2010 [9].\n\nMars exploration missions) [15]. This task served three main goals: 1) Enhance the\nutility of SDAT/SOAS by including appropriate mathematical models for vestibular\nand visual sensory cues, and CNS (central nervous system) gravito-inertial force resolution into perceived tilt and translation estimates from Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology's (MIT's) Observer model, and revalidating it using existing aeronautical\ndata sets. 2) Extend the models to describe 0-G, Shuttle, and Altair landing illusions,\nvalidating the models using Shuttle and Altair simulator data sets, and current theories\n(e.g., ROTTR). 3) Extend SDAT/SOAS to consider multiple visual frames of reference, the effects of visual attention and sensory workload, and the cognitive costs of\nmental rotation and reorientation. The enhanced SDAT/SOAS were validated via\nsimulator experiments. Four key findings from this research were as follows. 1) MIT's\nObserver model was merged with SDAT; (2) SDAT was enhanced with an attention\nmodel termed N-SEEV (noticing-salience, expectancy, effort, and value) and with\nthree new illusion models, verification tests, and comparisons of analytical results\nproduced by SDAT and Observer; (3) SDAT was validated with anonymous data sets\nof helicopter pilots who experienced spatial disorientation (SD); and (4) an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved Space Shuttle spatial orientation survey was\ncompleted. The outcome of this research answers a part of HFBP Risk of Inadequate\nHuman-Computer Interaction and the associated HF portfolio gap HCI-03 we need\nHCI guidelines (e.g., display configuration, screen-navigation) to mitigate the performance decrements and operational conditions of long duration space.\n3.6\n\nSpace Performance Research Integration Tool (S-PRINT).\n\nThe purpose of the Space Performance Research Integration Tool (S-PRINT) task was\nto build off of earlier validated human performance model work (e.g. MIDAS-FAST)\nto develop tools and empirically-based guidelines that support human performance\nresearchers, mission planners, automation designers, and astronauts in long-duration\nmissions, specifically human performance in unexpected workload transition situations [16]. These situations, when addressed by fatigued astronauts, constitute worstcase scenarios that require specific, in-depth investigation. S-PRINT helps users anticipate and avoid potential problems related to unexpected workload transitions by\nidentifying the expected effects of operator fatigue, automation system design, and\ntask factors on overload performance, and assure that systems can be designed in such\na way as to minimize transient, and long-term impacts of space missions on performance.\nThe S-PRINT task provided a validated, model-based tool to help researchers evaluate potential long-duration missions, identify vulnerabilities, and test potential mitigation strategies to help ensure effective performance and safe space missions. In\naddition to the meta-analyses, the project included multiple human-in-the-loop\n(HITL) studies to investigate 1) human-automation interaction (exploring, in particular, the effects of automation design factors and failure types on automation bias and\ncomplacency), 2) multitasking in overload situations. The results of these studies have\nbeen published and contribute to the scientific knowledge in human-automation interaction and human performance in overload. These two topic areas are relevant in numerous Earth-based domains.\n\nThe S-PRINT task also developed component models that enable the software to\npredict; 1) the effects of fatigue (i.e., due to sleep deprivation, sleep restriction, sleep\ninertia, and circadian cycle effects) on task completion time and task accuracy, 2) the\neffects of automation design factors (e.g., reliability, degree of automation or function\nallocation) on operator performance, 3) the effects of failure type on operator performance, and 4) the effects of task factors (i.e., salience, expectancy, effort, and value)\non task selection in overload. All of these areas are relevant in Earth-based industries\nthat require around-the-clock operations, involve the use of automation, and offer the\npotential for situations that put an operator in overload conditions (e.g. medicine,\nprocess control, military operations, and transportation). The outcome of this research\nadds an approach that can be used HFBP\xe2\x80\x99s Risk of inadequate mission, process, and\ntask design and the associated HF portfolio gap MPTASK-01: We need methods and\ntools to collect measures of missions, process, and task performance, and Behavioral\nPerformance (BP) gap Sleep 8 we need to develop individualized scheduling tools\nthat predict the effects of sleep-wake cycles, light and other countermeasures on performance, and can be used to identify optimal (and vulnerable) performance periods\nduring spaceflight [17].\n3.7\n\nOccupant protection Data Mining and Modeling\n\nThe risk of injury due to dynamic loads is poorly understood for spaceflight [18]. It is\nnecessary that the risk to crew members associated with dynamic loads be reduced.\nMany differences exist between the well-documented automotive and military environment (NHTSA, MILSPEC) and those experienced in space flight operations. For\ninstance, the loads experienced in space flight are often a multi-axial, complex impact\nthat is unique to a particular vehicle design, which differences from terrestrial vehicles. Limitations of the current NASA standard require that: 1) a Finite Element (FE)\nmodel of test device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) Anthropometric Test\nDevice (ATD) be developed, and 2) data mining of existing human injury and response data using the THOR FE model be performed. The purpose of the OP task\ntherefore is to define the scope of dynamic loads reasonably expected in current and\nfuture spaceflight systems, identify the appropriate human surrogate(s) for implementing injury assessment reference values (IARVs) appropriate for spaceflight loading\nconditions, develop IARVs based on Definition of Acceptable Risk (DAR), and validate the IARVs through sub-injurious human testing at nominal landing loads.\nIn order to develop updated standards, adequate injury assessment tools must be\ncompleted. The THOR ATD was chosen as the appropriate human surrogate as it is\nthe most biofidelic ATD available for assessing dynamic loads [18]. The THOR ATD\nis limited as the THOR responses are not well correlated to low injury risk. New injury risk functions are therefore needed. The OP risk sets out to develop new functions\nby comparing the THOR ATD datasets against existing datasets from Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.\nThe data mining portion of the task, requires that each impact case be recreated to\ndetermine injury risk. Physical recreation of all impact cases is not feasible. A numerical model of the THOR ATD is being generated since physical recreation of each\ncase is not feasible. An existing THOR FE model is being refined and validated. Additional THOR ATD testing will be conducted at two facilities and ATD response\n\ndata will be collected to supplement the available THOR ATD validation data. The\nFE model responses will then be assessed against the physical ATD responses. Once\nthe ATD model is validated, it will be used in the data mining portion of the study.\nThis task contributes to OP-02 and OP-03 by developing an ATD analytical model.\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s HRP needs to study the impact of long duration space flight on human crew\nmembers without the luxury of limitless access to the space environment. This fact\nrequires multiple, cooperative approaches to predict when humans will be able to\nperform optimally and the situations that occur that tax the human capacity for optimal performance. HRP is investing resources into developing valid, predictive capabilities in the modeling and simulation domain. The current article highlights that\nHRP HFBP has developed models in the HAB, MPTASK, HARI, HCI and OP research areas that seek to reduce the risks to exploration class mission operations.\nThe computational model development aspect the Habitability risk aims to provide\nNASA with estimates on the spacecraft/habitat volume based on mission parameters\nand constraints, provide layout assumptions for a given volume, assess volumes based\non a set of performance metrics, and inform risk characteristics associated with a volume. This research will establish the minimum volume required for personal space,\nexercise, sleep, eat, work and relaxation. Distinct areas for each activity are not going\nto be possible so NASA is looking to predict the minimum space required to safely\nconduct the mission. Two ongoing modeling and simulation task in the Habitability\nrisk aim to establish recommendations for future vehicle design layout and minimum\nnet habitable volume (NHV).\nThe computational model development aspect of the HARI risk aims to develop,\nand validate methods and guidelines for identifying human-automation/robot task\ninformation needs, function allocation, and team composition for future long duration,\nlong distance space missions. One validated model- and simulation-based tool for\npredicting operator performance when working with a robotic arm in different function allocation situations provided NASA with the capability to augment and perform\nmodel manipulations to evaluate different function allocation strategies for future\nhuman-robotic systems. This one effort is a necessary step and it is anticipated that\nfuture efforts build on the lessons learned by the MIDAS-FAST research team for\nfuture function allocation (and HARI) related research tasks.\nThe computational model development aspect of the HCI risk aims to mitigate the\nperformance decrements and operational conditions of long duration space operations.\nHCI approaches often require optimization of interface designs so that human performance is maximized. HCI and interface designs rely on the human\xe2\x80\x99s ability to receive\nand encode the information that is presented. In order for this encoding to occur, the\nhuman needs to be aware of the information and to attend to the information. As the\nhuman\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy increases, attention allocation takes on an increasingly important\nrole for critical information intake. The outcome of this research has provided insights\ninto human performance capability in the face of spatial disorientation in microgravity. The attention allocation model that was developed in response to this HCI risk\n\nserves as the backbone to many HPMs in use across the field of modeling and simulation.\nThe computational model development aspect of MPTASK risk aims to reduce the\nrisk to mission performance that are the result of inefficiencies caused by the task,\nschedule, or procedure design. Two modeling and simulation efforts have been recently completed that address aspects of this very large risk area. The S-PRINT task\nprovided model-based human performance predictions on the effects of automation\ndesign factors and failure types on automation bias, and the impact of complacency\nand multitasking in operator \xe2\x80\x9coverload\xe2\x80\x9d conditions. This effort produced a general\nmodel capability that can be modified with different automation types to examine the\nimpact of context and situation demands on operator performance with the main focus\non transitions between overloaded and under-loaded individuals. The interest in this\neffort was to implement a fatigue model into a human performance model for use by\nmission schedulers. The scenario that exercised the automation designs was a robotic\narm control while dealing with an environmental control and life support system fault.\nThe second MPTASK modeling effort was of a piloted lunar landing task. This effort\ncompleted a critical analysis of human operator-automation interactions and task allocations for lunar landing operations (information requirements, decision making, and\nthe selection of action), and developed and validated a closed-loop pilot-vehicle model, integrating vehicle dynamics and HPMs.\nThe computational model development aspect of the OP Risk aims to reduce the\nrisks associated with dynamic loads. One modeling and simulation effort is underway\nfor the OIP risk. The OP computation model development is a practical example that\nillustrates how existing validated datasets can be leveraged to support modeling and\nsimulation approaches to improve algorithms for predicting human performance.\nAs illustrated in the present article, many distinct modeling and simulation efforts\nare being completed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s HRP. The investments that have been made in modeling and simulation have already and will continue to provide NASA with a number\nof validated capabilities. Possessing such capabilities may allow NASA to consider\nintegrating the models together (where feasible) to generate integrated human-system\nmodel performance predictions.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nExtreme and hostile environments require the human to perform optimally in order to\nsuccessfully accomplish mission goals. Sub-optimal performance in the US DoD and\nNASA missions has the potential to increase the risks of unsuccessful mission operations. It is only with a comprehensive research program that includes both the empirical research efforts complemented with a modeling and simulation research path that\nthe designs of the habitability, human computer interaction, human automation integration, task and occupant protection will successfully enable the human to perform in\nextreme environments, such as the one that will be faced in the travel to Mars.\nAcknowledgments.
