The Asteroid\nRedirect Crewed Mission (ARCM), which represents the third segment of\nthe Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), could be performed on EM-3 or EM-4\ndepending on asteroid return date.\nRecent NASA studies have raised questions on how we could progress from\ncurrent Human Space Flight (HSF) efforts to longer term human exploration\nof Mars. This paper will describe the benefits of execution of the ARM as the\ninitial stepping stone towards Mars exploration, and how the capabilities\nrequired to send humans to Mars could be built upon those developed for the\nasteroid mission. A series of potential interim missions aimed at developing\nsuch capabilities will be described, and the feasibility of such mission\nmanifest will be discussed. Options for the asteroid crewed mission will also\nbe addressed, including crew size and mission duration.\n\n*\n\nAerospace Engineer, Advanced Mission Development Group, Technical Integration Office, Engineering\nDirectorate/EA4.\n\xe2\x80\xa0\nLead, Advanced Mission Development Group, Technical Integration Office, Engineering Directorate/EA4.\n1\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\n\n'
