b"USE OF PRECISION TIME AND TIME INTERVAL (PTTI)\nJ. D. Taylor, ADTC, EglinAFB\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAn introduction, or rather a reintroduction for many, to the practical\nutilization of time synchronization and time interval measurements\non the various DoD test ranges is the topic for today. The presentation will review the overall capabilities of various missile ranges to\ndetermine precise time-of-day by synchronizing to available\nreferences and applying this time point to instrumentation for time\ninterval measurements. Global and downrange test sites will not\nbe addressed.\n\nAbackward look over the past 20 years indicates that the origin and\nevolution of the ranges has been directly proportional to the DoD\ndevelopment efforts in the aircraft, missile, and defense systems\nfields. Tremendous advances in range technology paralleled\n\n\\\n\nI\n\nindustrial efforts to improve weapons systems. Range timing\napplications have historically fitted into the scheme of testing\nweapons systems even in the earliest days of testing. Interestingly\nenough, the essential importance of instrumentation time interval\nmeasurements has not changed over the years. Only the methods\nused in the determination of precise time and the formulation of\ninterval measurement codes have changed.\nAn important aspect of range operations must be remembered;\nPTTI on a test range is actually separated into two distinct\ndisciplines, time synchronization to a known source and the\ndevelopment of synchronized codes for interval measurements.\nThese integral tasks are accomplished routinely every day, but\nrange people normally interpret TIME as being related to time\ninterval measurement, i. e., time code application, rather than\ntime synchronization.\nSYNCHRONIZATION\nA review of range time synchronization methods over the past years\nsuggests a chronological outline for the technical development of the\nranges. As a beginning, visualize that in the 1950s installations\nsimilar to Eglin Air Force Base were used to test relatively\n\nsimple weapons. Instrumentation film cameras were common and\n\n91\n\nPreceding page blank\n\ntape recorders were coming into good use. In the latter 1950s the\nArmament Development & Test Center (ADTC), along with other\npotential missile test centers, began preparations for the missile\nera. Sophisticated range instrumentation was installed which required\naccurate time correlation of events such as tracking radar time space\nposition information (TSPI). Computer analysis of data demanded\ntime cor.relation between sites to machine process the data.\nDuring this period, the IRIG Standard Time Codes were published\nand the Naval Observatory began PTTI with Loran transmissions.\nADTC was one of the ranges fortunate enough to be within easy\nrange of the East Coast chain. Our synchronization problems were\neliminated. Other ranges, particularly in the West, were not so\nfortunate. In fact, until 1973, the Western ranges did not have\nLoran transmissions for PTTI purposes. In the summer of 1973,\nthe Loran-D site at Nellis AFB, NV, came into being. Until that\ntime, the Hawaiian Loran chain, WWV, or portable atomic clocks\nhad to be used. T i Loran-D installation made available accurate\nhs\nLoran synch to all the Western ranges and for the first time,\nlow-cost, accurate time-of-day synch to the Naval Observatory\nwas available to all the continental ranges and sophisticated time\ncorrelation was easily available. Of course, even today all ranges\nare not synched to Loran as there is no need for all ranges to be so\naccurately synchronized. However, today's ranges are converting\nto Loran synchronization techniques because of the inherent\naccuracy and cost effectiveness, a giant step forward. A few\nyears ago, 1 microsecond synchronization w a s a debatable\n0\nsubject for everyday range operation, today it is expected.\n.\nAPPLICATIONS\nThe DoD test range mission support requirements and capabilities\nare intricate and ever changing. Instrumentation equipment and\ntest schemes vary widely from coast to coast according to the\nrequirements and type of testing conducted for each service, i. e.,\nArmy, Navy, Air Force. Considering the three services, it is\neasy to imagine that ground, air, and water testing will require\ndifferent physical as well as instrumentation environments. Each\nservice has specialty, such as Ft. Huachuca for the Army,\nAFWR for the Navy, and AFFTC for the Air Force. With such\ndiversity, it is difficult to realize any commonality between\ninstallations, yet there is one data system mutual to all DoD test\nranges. This is PTTI.\n\n92\n\nPTTI has two general classes of range applications, These two types\nof applications can be described as the WWV millisecond synch\ntype and the WWV-Loran microsecond synch type. Within these\ntwo techniques, the former application can be applied more readily\nto ranges smaller in physical size and generally operate within the\nrange boundaries. The second type application refers to larger\ninstallations which must operate timing equipment closely\nsynchronized over large distances which prohibit synch distribution\nby practical methods. Also, this includes the larger national and\nspace ranges which must operate together in real-time for\ntracking and data work. These large ranges have the more\nstringent synchronization accuracy requirements.\nTypical examples of the above WWV synch type ranges which operate\nwithin their own boundaries are: NWL, Dahlgren, VA. , Tonopah\nTest Range, N V . , Dugway Proving Ground, UT., Ft. Huachuca,\nAZ, and Holloman AFB, NM. These ranges operate within\nsmaller restricted physical sizes which allows time distribution\nfrom a central point. Synchronization is maintained at the central\nfacility to the required accuracy and distribution of the time\nsignals is by transmission over VHF or data line to the local users.\nThe accuracy of time correlation between the closely positioned\npoints is limited by the time delay of the distribution system and is\nusually in the order of milliseconds. This is not to say that some\nof the smaller ranges do not have precision PTTI requirements for\ndata correlation. In fact, some of the most difficult and precise\ntime interval measurements are required in the unusual enVironments of ballistics tunnels o r other weapons ballistics tests.\nThe second type of PTTI application involves WWV-Loran type synch\nand ranges which use this type synch are: NATC, Patuxent River,\nMD., ADTC, EAFB, FL., WSME, NM., CORRanges, NWC.,\nand Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. These ranges employ two different\nconcepts of approaching PTTI: (I) a central timing facility with\nassociated distribution system and/or (2) independently synchronized\ninstallations.\nA range which can be used as a prime example of the central timing\nfacility concept is WSMR. WSMR has a central timing facility\nequipped with Loran synch receivers and three primary atomic\nstandards for stable time base sources. After development of the\nproper timing signals, distribution is made from the timing central\n\n93\n\nI\n\nto a VHF transmission system and various combinations of microwave and data line drivers for utilization on theodolite stations,\nhigh-speed cameras, etc. One of the more important and interesting\naspects of this distribution system is the resynchronization technique\nused for stabilizing distant radar o r satellite installations with the\ntiming central in lieu of individual site synchronization with Loran.\nThis type system was developed in the Western part of the continent\nin the late 1950s and early 1960s for the simple reason that Loran\nwas not available and WSMR had requirements for accurate\nintrarange synch at remote installations. The results were the\nproblem was technically solved by measuring round trip transmission\ndelays and correcting for these delays in the receiving unit, Until\nthe Dana, Oh, Loran station came into existence, this was the\nonly feasible method WSMR o r any other Western range had of\nachieving PTTI. A s an example, when WSMR had a requirement\nto operate a tracking site at Green River, UT, in 1965, the only\nmethod available to achieve the required accuracy at this site 600\nmiles from the timing central was to use portable atomic clocks.\nOf course, the Nellis Loran-D installation has made all these type\nPTTI problems history.\nA second approach to achieving accurate PTTI is separately to\nsynchronize each site o r installation to a Loran transmission.\nThis method is used at such installations as: ADTC, AFETR,\nSAMTEC, AFWR, and PMR for interrange and intrarange PTTI\nsolutions. This method requires that each site to be used have a\nLoran synch system capable of independent determination of PTTI,\nand can either be composed of the newer automatic tracking\nreceivers o r a manual system be used. An advantage of the independent method is that each site can independently maintain a\nsynchronization to the Naval Observatory and eliminate the problems\nassociated with transmission systems reliability. Cost is not\nappreciably increased for these sites and if the cost of the transmission system were considered, the independent synch method\nwould be the most cost effective method. Very good PTTI is\navailable with this concept of range synchronization.\n\nAs previously stated, global and down-range sites will not be\ndiscussed. When the site is not within range of a Loran transmission, then some of the advanced techniques explained in the\nearlier papers must be employed.\n\na\n\n94\n\nAny discussion of DoD range PTTI would not be complete Without a\nfew words on the airborne data correlation situation. Correlation\nof airborne collected data with ground instrumentation had\nhistorically been a problem. In today's world of electro-optical\nweapons, airborne data correlation has become even more\nimportant. Ranges involved in this type testing have two\nalternatives for time tagging airborne data: (1) transmission of a\ntime code or, (2) an onboard PTTI device. The former case of the\ntransmitted time code is often inadequate as the data correlation\nis on the order of milliseconds. The latter case of an onboard\nclock poses the problem of synchronizing the clock accurately\nenough to satisfy the requirements over the time profile of the\nmission. Certainly, the clock frequency standard must be stable\nenough to maintain adequate synch after the initial setup. An\ninteresting and obvious situation develops during preflight clock\nsynch if the aircraft is not on aircraft internal power. During\npower switch, e r r o r s can be injected in the clock so caution must\nbe exercised.\n\nWithin the past 12 months, ADTC has been required to support\nelectro-optical type tests with very demanding time correlation.\nFor instance, one particular laser decoy test required time\ncorrelation and resolution within 1 microsecond between airborne\nand ground instrumentation. A s of this time, ADTC has not\nactually achieved a data correlation this accurate for this\ntest.\nCONCLUSION\nThis paper has attempted to present the status of the majority\nof DoD test ranges in regard to PTTI. The status of 'PTTI for\nthese ranges is that time-of-day synchronization to the U. S.\nNaval Observatory via Loran methods has eliminated synch\naccuracy problems within the continental boundaries of the U. S\n.\nTime interval measurements a r e likewise being satisfied by a\ndiversity of methods. This is not to imply that all PTTI problems\nare solved, as they are not. Fortunately, this country has the\ntechnical resources from organizations such as the Naval\nObservatory, Bureau of Standards, and AGMC to help solve\nexisting and future PTTI problems. One thing is always certain\nin PTTI applications, accuracy requirements always seem to\nincrease.\n\n95\n\n"
