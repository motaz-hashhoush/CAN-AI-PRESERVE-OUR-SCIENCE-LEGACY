b'GevrreV Cooperation: Ongoing Strategies\nDavid J. Thompson\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, Maryland\nOrt behalf of the Fenni Large Area Telescope Collaboration\n\nAlthough many of their scientific interests overlap, current GeV and reV telescopes have\nmany properties that show strong contrasts. Field of view, duty cycle, speed of analysis,\nphoton counting statistics, background, and data release policies differ markedly. The\nchallenge for cooperative studies has been to make the best use of complementary\nproperties. One example is GeV discovery and monitoring surveys for AGN coupled\nwith rev time variability studies. Another is GeV spectral measurements for Galactic\nsources joined with reV spatial resolution. In many cases, sharing of information has\nbeen a positive factor, and continuing to explore ways to exchange results and ideas will\nhelp to maximize the scientific return from all gamma-ray observatories.\n\n'
