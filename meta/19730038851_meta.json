It is pointed out that the widely used automobile is the most inefficient mode of transportation. Various new developments in the field of ground transportation are considered. It is suggested to develop an integrated transportation system which would replace the various competing modes of automobile, bus, rail, and air with a single system for moving people and goods from their origins to  their destinations. The Intermodal Automated Transfer system discussed would treat the passenger, his baggage, and the seat in which he travels as a unit which would stay together throughout a trip, regardless of the carrier used.", "title": "Door to door short haul.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T03:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19730038851, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Steven, F.
