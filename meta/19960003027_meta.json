The mission adhered to the guidelines and constraints set forth by the Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative Proposal, which was sponsored by the Universities Space Research Association. This report represents a redesign of that original concept. The main differences include a higher orbit and a three axis stabilization system. Of course, these changes imparted significant effects upon the other subsystems. Outlined in this document are those modifications and it offers some new analyses as well. For each subsystem there is a brief description, followed by relevant design assumptions, a summary of conclusions, and finally all pertinent supporting data and graphs. Towards the end of the report. the important issue of cost is addressed as well. Whenever possible, parametric analyses were made.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960003027, "id": "6f3133c00ca44e779aee35c4a5334d08", "publicationDate": "1994-12-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960003027.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960003027/downloads/19960003027.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960003027/downloads/19960003027.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960003027/downloads/19960003027.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
