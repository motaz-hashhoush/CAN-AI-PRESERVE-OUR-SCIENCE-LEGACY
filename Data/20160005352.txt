b'NASA photo\n\nGreen Liquid Monopropellant\nThruster\nFor in-space propulsion in challenging environmental\nconditions\nPhysical Sciences, Inc. (PSI), and Orbital Technologies Corporation\n(ORBITEC) are developing a unique chemical propulsion system for\nnext-generation NASA science spacecraft and missions. The system is compact,\nlightweight, and can operate with high reliability over extended periods of\ntime and under a wide range of thermal environments. The system uses a new\nstorable, low-toxicity liquid monopropellant as its working fluid. In Phase I,\nthe team demonstrated experimentally the critical ignition and combustion\nprocesses for the propellant and used the data to develop thruster design\nconcepts.\nIn Phase II, the team developed and demonstrated in the laboratory a proofof-concept prototype thruster. A Phase III project is envisioned to develop a\nfull-scale protoflight propulsion system applicable to a class of NASA missions.\n\nApplications\nNASA\n\nMilitary\n\nThis technology is ideal for\npropulsion systems in challenging\nenvironmental conditions, with long\noperational life, and with high duty\ncycles:\n}} Missions to other planets, their\nmoons, and other small bodies:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Sampling their atmospheres\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Descent and landing on their\nsurfaces\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Returning soil samples\nfrom their surfaces in ascent\nmodules\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Rendezvous and docking with\norbiting mother ships\n}} Missions to the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s Moon,\nVenus, Mars and its moons, the\nmoons of Jupiter, and asteroids\n\n}} Air Force:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Liquid thrusters for in-space\npropulsion\n}} National Reconnaissance\nOrganization:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Fast-response, long-life\nmaneuvering propulsion\nsystems\n}} Army:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Green monopropellant\xe2\x80\x93based,\nhigh-pressure gas generators\nfor pressurizing gelled\npropellants\n}} Other Department of Defense:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Liquid engines for propelling\nhighly maneuverable,\nthrottleable tactical missiles\n\nPhase II Objectives\n}} Demonstrate operation of a prototype\nliquid monopropellant thruster\nincorporating the new fast-response,\nhigh-reliability, and long-life ignition\nsystem\n}} Develop ignition system designs to\noptimize performance\n}} Develop a modular, small-scale test\nthruster incorporating the ignition\nsystem to allow rapid changeability of\ncomponents representative of different\nignition/combustor designs\n}} Characterize the operation and performance of the small-scale thruster to\ndemonstrate propulsive performance\nand ignition system start/stop/restart\n}} Develop functional prototype of a\nlarge-scale thruster and demonstrate\nits operation\n}} Develop complete propulsion system\ndesign incorporating the proposed\nin-space thruster technology\n\t\nBenefits\n}} Compact and lightweight\n}} Can operate reliably over extended\nperiods of time and under a wide\nrange of thermal environments\nFirm Contact\nPhysical Sciences, Inc.\nPrakash B.
