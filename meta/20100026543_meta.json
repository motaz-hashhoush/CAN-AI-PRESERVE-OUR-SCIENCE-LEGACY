A total of 561 thunderstorms have been examined in the past year (409 non-severe, 152 severe) from four regions of the country (North Alabama, Washington D.C., High Plains of CO/KS, and Oklahoma). Results continue to indicate that the 2 lightning jump algorithm configuration holds the most promise in terms of prospective operational lightning jump algorithms, with a probability of detection (POD) at 81%, a false alarm rate (FAR) of 45%, a critical success index (CSI) of 49% and a Heidke Skill Score (HSS) of 0.66. The second best performing algorithm configuration was the Threshold 4 algorithm, which had a POD of 72%, FAR of 51%, a CSI of 41% and an HSS of 0.58. Because a more complex algorithm configuration shows the most promise in terms of prospective operational lightning jump algorithms, accurate thunderstorm cell tracking work must be undertaken to track lightning trends on an individual thunderstorm basis over time. While these numbers for the 2 configuration are impressive, the algorithm does have its weaknesses. Specifically, low-topped and tropical cyclone thunderstorm environments are present issues for the 2 lightning jump algorithm, because of the suppressed vertical depth impact on overall flash counts (i.e., a relative dearth in lightning). For example, in a sample of 120 thunderstorms from northern Alabama that contained 72 missed events by the 2 algorithm 36% of the misses were associated with these two environments (17 storms).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100026543, "endDate": "2010-06-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administraion", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "d4134efc8bc044a38569efe32a99788c", "id": "be99f92f179b4e15ac98dadd7371cc48"}], "name": "2010 NOAA STAR AWG/GO1S-RRR Review/NOAA", "location": "Madison, WI", "id": "d4134efc8bc044a38569efe32a99788c", "startDate": "2010-06-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100026543, "id": "8990704ea13f4dadae372d230cc03d10", "publicationDate": "2010-06-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100026543.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100026543/downloads/20100026543.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100026543/downloads/20100026543.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100026543/downloads/20100026543.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
