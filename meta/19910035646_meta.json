In blue light, for example, the amplitude was 3.2 mag in the early 1900s, 2.2 mag in the late 1960s, and 1.75 mag in 1990. Throughout this time, the brightness at maximum was constant in all colors. It is shown that the only possible explanation is nodal motion, where the inclination varies with a period of roughly 100,000 yr. The nodal motion is caused by a third star, for which the light curve, the colors, and the O - C curve already provide evidence. Thus, RW Per is only the fourth known star with large changes of eclipse amplitude and is only the second example of nodal motion.", "title": "RW Per - Nodal motion changes its amplitude by 1.4 mag", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T07:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910035646, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schaefer, Bradley E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "b11844b75b5b46228ffe64946b14e5b6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910035646, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fried, Robert E."}, "organization": {"name": "Braeside Observatory", "location": "Flagstaff, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "ae14f8ca897c43d08837b60615ce854b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910035646, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/115680", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "101", "submissionId": 19910035646, "issn": "0004-6256", "id": "09ab81edc0474c12aa86cce8507ae93f", "publicationName": "Astronomical Journal", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
