While waiting to test different components in the PTS, I was able to assist with testing for the Hose Management Assembly (HMA) and was able to work on a simulation in Labview. For the HMA, I was able to help with testing of a coating as well as to help test the durability of the pinch rollers in space. In Labview, I experimented with building a simulation for the PTS, to show where fluids and gases were flowing depending on which valves in the PTS were opened. Not all of the integrated parts required assembly level testing, which allowed me to test these parts individually by myself and document the results. I was also able to volunteer to assist project NEO, allowing me to gain some knowledge of cryogenic fluid systems.\n\n\n", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160001425, "id": "77eaec63fc44447388728c24694decf1", "publicationDate": "2015-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160001425.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160001425/downloads/20160001425.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160001425/downloads/20160001425.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160001425/downloads/20160001425.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
