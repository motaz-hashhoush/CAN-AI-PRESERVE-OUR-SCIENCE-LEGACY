Studies have accordingly been conducted within NASA to ascertain the specifications and projected operating costs of such a vehicle, as well as to identify critical, development-pacing technologies. Attention is here given not only to the rather conventional, 10-turbofan engined configuration thus arrived at, but numerous innovative configurations featuring such concepts as spanloading, removable cargo pods, and ground effect.", "title": "Advanced cargo aircraft may offer a potential renaissance in freight transportation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T02:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930063026, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morris, Shelby J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "50b7498ff5ed4f719982fdc29f055cb4"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930063026, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sawyer, Wallace C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "a606e30aec3c4a23b45254b651cd54a2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 19930063026, "endDate": "1993-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Symposium on the Future of Cargo Transport Aircraft", "location": "Strasbourg", "id": "024de92aa8d843a685087f1d7b77805b", "startDate": "1993-03-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19930063026, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930063026, "id": "8aef38500063476f9aac81fede5de934", "publicationDate": "1993-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
