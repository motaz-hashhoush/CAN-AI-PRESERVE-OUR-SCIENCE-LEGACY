To prepare, Goddard Space Flight Center provided Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding to ProSensing Inc., of Amherst, Massachusetts, to develop a compact ultrastable radiometer for sea surface salinity and soil moisture mapping. ProSensing incorporated small, low-cost, high-performance elements into just a few circuit boards and now offers two lightweight radiometers commercially. Government research agencies, university research groups, and large corporations around the world are using the devices for mapping soil moisture, ocean salinity, and wind speed.", "title": "Compact Radiometers Expand Climate Knowledge", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T09:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20110000752, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110000752, "id": "e138eeb95dfd40979589a06e06928b9e", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110000752.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110000752/downloads/20110000752.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110000752/downloads/20110000752.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110000752/downloads/20110000752.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
