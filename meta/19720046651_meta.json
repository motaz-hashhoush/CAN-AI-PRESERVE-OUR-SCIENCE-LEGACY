They occur in clusters or as isolated crater doublets. Results  of probability calculations and a Monte Carlo cratering simulation model show conclusively that many of the Mars craters could not have resulted from random single-body impact. The possibility that these craters are calderas is considered possible only if calderas on Mars form by mechanisms different from those on earth. However, clusters and  doublets could be caused by meteoroid breakup resulting from stresses induced in the meteoroid by the gravitational field of Mars. It is concluded that, under certain conditions, doublets should be produced  on Mars as a direct result of breakup of an impacting meteoroid. The  impact process can yield nonrandom crater distributions that should be observed in different degrees of development on different planetary surfaces.", "title": "Martian doublet craters.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T20:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720046651, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oberbeck, V.
