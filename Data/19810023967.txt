The poppet valve uses a pneumatic \xe2\x80\x9cspring\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhich holds the poppet valve against the piston while\nthe valve is opened and closed. To accomplish this, a\npoppet valve is slidably mounted in a \xe2\x80\x9cpneumatic\nspring\xe2\x80\x9d chamber which reaches a pressure approaching\nthe gas supply pressure and, during the opening of the\nvalve, the \xe2\x80\x9cspring\xe2\x80\x9d chamber retains enough pressure to\nhold the poppet valve onto the piston. In addition, the\nbottom of the poppet valve can have a suction cup type\nconfiguration to hold the poppet valve on the piston\nduring the down stroke.\n5 Claims, 7 Drawing Figures\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 18,1981\n\nSheet 1 of 4\n\nh\n\n'$\n\n\\\n\nk\n\nc,\nQ\n\nh\n\nt\nh\n\nh\n\n4,283,995\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 18,1981\n\nSheet 2 of 4\n\n4,283,995\n\nU.S. Patent\n\n2\n\nAug. 18, 1981\n\nSheet 3 of 4\n\n4,283,995\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nAug. 18, 1981\n\nSheet 4 of 4\n\n4,283,995\n\nFIG.5\n\n4\n\n5?\n\n68\n\nFIG. 6\n65\n\n7\n\nL\n\n63\xe2\x80\x99\n\n64\n\n_I\n\n.65\n\nFIG. 7\n\n1\n\n4,283,995\n\n2\n\nproach the gas pressure in the high pressure gas supply\nRECIPROCATING ENGINES\nplenum.

Above the\nvalve body is a cylindrical pneumatic spring body\nIn the diagrammatic illustration of the BDC position\nwhich has six equiangularly spaced, pneumatic spring\nof the piston 10 in FIG. 1 the pressure in the cylinder 11\nchambers in alignment with the gas valves.

During this period the gas pressure in the\nthe plenum 16.

As the port\n24 is opened, the pressure in the plenum 16 drops rapidly as the working fluid in the plenum I6 transfers to\nthe cylinder 11. During the time that the pressure in the 5\nplenum 16 drops, the pressure in the spring chamber 18\nalso drops but at a relatively slow rate controlled by the\nsize of the ports 19. The piston EO subsequently passes\nthrough the maximum upper travel point 25 and then\ntravels downwardly. As the piston 10 travels down- 10\nwardly, the poppet valve 14 is pressure attached to the\ntop of the piston 10 and moves downwardly therewith.\nAt the point 26 011 the graph, the poppet valve closes\nthe port 24 and the gas expansion in the chamber I1\nmoves the piston 10 downwardly. As the piston 10 15\nmoves downwardly, the pressure in the plenum 16 and\nspring chamber I8 again builds up. At the point 27 on\nthe graph, the piston 1 opens the exhaust ports 12 and\n1\ncontinues its travel to the BDC point 28 shown on the\ngraph. From point 28, the cycle repeats.\n20\nFIG. 1 illustrates a poppet valve 14 for admitting\nhigh pressure gaseous fluid without requiring a cam\nactuation. As the poppet valve 14 is initially opened, the\nspring chamber 18 provides pressure to hold the poppet\nvalve against the upper surface of the piston 10. The 25\nbottom of the poppet valve 1 is shaped to trap a vol4\nume of gas between the poppet valve 14 and the piston\n10. The pressure differential relative to the trapped\nspace of the poppet valve 14. maintains the poppet valve\n14. against the upper surface of the piston while it moves 30\ndownwardly. These two features prevent \xe2\x80\x9cchattering\xe2\x80\x9d\nof the poppet valve and hold the poppet valve I4 in\ncontact with the piston BO through the \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d phase of\nthe poppet valve 14.\nReferring now to FIG. 2, a cross-section through a 35\ntypical engine arrangement is illustrated. In FIG. 2, a\nfuel tank 30 contains liquid hydrazine fuel which is\nconverted from liquid to gaseous form and supplied to\nthe high pressure chamber 16 via a fuel pump 31, control valve 32, gas generator 39 and pipes 17. The cham- 40\nber 16 is separated from the cylinder 11 by a poppet\nassembly 14a at the head of each cylinder 11.The piston\n10 in cylinder 1 operates through a connecting rod 35\n1\nto move a crankshaft 36. The crankshaft 36 drives a gear\ntrain 37 which rotates the propeller drive shaft 38. Ex- 45\ncess heat is rejected to the fuel via a heat exchanger 33\nlocated in the fuel tank. Various other assemblies are\nillustrated but are not described herein because they are\nnot necessary for an understanding of the invention.\nReferring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, FIG. 3 illustrates a 50\ncylinder 1 with the piston 10 in a T D C position while\n1\nFIG. 4 illustrates a piston IO in a BDC position. The\npiston BO has piston rings 40, a flat top surface 41 and is\nconnected by a wrist pin 42 to a connecting rod 35.\nAttached to the upper end of the cylinder 11 is a tubular 55\nbody member 34 with a dome-shaped closure member\n43 at its upper end. Between the closure member 43 and\ntubular body member 34 is an annular recess 44 which\nopens to circumferentially spaced, longitudinal keyways 45. The longitudinal keyways 45 extend length- 60\nwise of the tubular body member 34..The tubular body\nmember 34 ai its lower end has a transverse head or cap\nplate 47 (corresponds to 13 in FIGS. 1 and 2). The head\nplate 4.7 has a centrally located pin member 4 which\n3\nextends upwardly and through a central opening 49 in a 6 5\nseries of stacked spring washers 50 also provided with\naligned openings 500 radially spaced from the control\nopening 49. Between the pin member 48 and cylindrical\n\n4-\n\nwall 51 of the tubular member 34 is an annulus which\nreceives an upper pneumatic spring body member 52\nand lower poppet valve body rn-mber 53. Above the\nupper annular body member 52 is a tubular hold down\nring 54 which is disposed between the upper pneumatic\nspring surface of the upper body member 52 and the\nedge of the spring washers 50. The spring washers 50\nare concave shaped. By virtue of the shape of the spring\nwashers and a latch nut 55 on the pin members 40, the\nspring washers 50 hold the ring member 54 against the\npneumatic spring body member 52.\nThe lower poppet valve body member 53 has six,\nequiangularly spaced, vertical poppet guide openings GO\ndisposed around the pin member 4 8 for respectively\nreceiving the poppet valves 61 (See FIG. 3 for crosssection). The poppet valves are slidably received in\neach of the poppet guide openings 60.\nReferring to FIGS. 3-7, the construction of the pneumatic spring body member 52 is illustrated in detail. The\nstructure of the spring body member 52 includes six,\nequiangularly spaced, blind bores 62 which are interconnected at their open ends 63 by interconnecting slots\nor channels 64. This provides for equalization of gas\npressures within the various blind bores 62. The periphery of the spring chamber body member 52 has vertical\nkeyway slots 65 which are adapted for alignment with\nthe keyways 45 of the tubular body member 34. Similarly, the valve body member 53 illustrated in FIGS. 3\nand 4 has equiangularly spaced, vertical keyways 66\nwhich are adapted to align with the keyways 4.5 of the\ntubular body member 34. Keys (not shown) in the lteyways 34, 65, 66 fix the body members against rotation\nwithin the member 4.5 and align the members 52, 53\nrelative to one another. A keeper can \xe2\x80\x98se inserted in the\ngroove 44. In the relative alignment of the members 52,\n53 the poppet guide openings 40 are aligned with the\nblind bores 62. The blind bores 62 have a diameter\ndimension less than the diameter of the poppet guide\nopenings 66) thereby forming downwardly facing shoulders 67.\nThrough the center of the body members 52, i3 are\ncentral bores 68, 69 for receiving the pin member 48.\nBetween the central vertically aligned bores 68, 69 and\nthe vertically aligned bores 60, 62 are a series of various\ndiameter vertical bores 70, 70n which extend through\nboth body members 52, 53. At the bottom of the bores\n70, 70a channels 71 are provided to interconnect the\nbores 70, 70a to the interior of the poppet guide bores\n60. Similarly around the periphery of the body members\n52, 53 are vertical bores 72, 720 which similarly interconnect with the poppet guide bores 66) at the lower\nend. The upper surface of the spring body member 52\nhas arcuate slots 73, 74 cut into its upper surface to\ninterconnect various bores 70,704 72, 72a. The purpose\nof the bores 7Q,700, 72,720 is to provide as large a flow\nor bypass passage as possible between the plenum 26\nand the openings 71 in the poppet guide bores 6Q.\nAs shown in FIG. 3, the outside of a poppet valve 61\nis shaped somewhat like an egg holder. The poppet\nvalve 6B has an upper cylindrically shaped outer wall 75\ndisposed within the poppet guide bore 60. The wall 75\nhas a shorter length than the depth of the guidebore 60.\nThe outer wall 75 at its lower end forms a downwardly\nfacing shoulder 76 which is adapted to sealingly engage\nan upwardly facing surface 77 disposed about the poppet valve opening 24 in the head member 4.7. The upper\npart of the poppet valve 61 has a hollow portion formed\nby a bore 70 and ogive shaped depression 79. The cen-\n\n5\n\n4,283,995\n\ntral part of the poppet valve 61 tapers inwardly to a\ncentral portion 80 which extends through the bore 24\nand a lower pedestal portion 82 which is extended outwardly and has a dome shaped recess 83 extending\nupwardly and inwardly from a cylindrical sealing sur- 5\nface 84.\nThe operation of the poppet valves 61 is the same as\ndescribed heretofore with respect to FIG. 1. The plenum 16 is charged with high pressure gas which is also\npresent in the communication bores 70,7Oa,72,72a and 1\n0\nprevented from entering the expansion chamber above\nthe piston 10 by virtue of the closed poppet valves 61.\nThe poppet valves close by virtue of valve shoulders 76\nengaging the sealing surface 77 as shown in FIG. 4 Not\n.\nonly the plenum 16 is charged with high pressure gas 15\nbut the clearance space 61a between the poppet valves\n61 and the poppet guide bores 60 as well as the spaces\n67u between the body members 52,53permits the pressure in the blind bores 62 to reach almost the same level\nas the pressure in the plenum 16. The spaces 67a are 20\nshown in exaggerated size in FIG. 4 for purposes of\nillustration. This pressure is illustrated by the curves of\nFIG. 1. When the head of the piston 10 engages the\npoppet valves 61,the pressure in the spring chambers 18\nformed by the blind bores 62 is trapped and the poppets 25\n61 are urged upwardly to open the channels 71 and\ncommunicate the high pressure gas to the volume directly above the piston. At the time the pressure in the\nblind bores 62 is trapped it provides a cushioning effect\non the rising poppet valves 61.As the piston 10 starts 30\ndownwardly the high pressure gas is at a greater pressure than the trapped pressure in the recess 83 of a\npoppet valve 61 so that the pressure differential holds\nthe poppet valve 61 on the top surface of the piston 10\n35\nuntil the valve closes.\nIt should be appreciated that the spring chambers 18\nabove a poppet valves 61 are in communication with the\nplenum 16 by virtue of bores 70-72, washer openings\nMa, and clearance spaces 614 67u. all of which approximate or are equivalent to an opening 19 as shown in the 40\nvalve guide 15 in FIG. 1. The period of time that the\npoppet valves are actuated or opened by the piston is\nvery short as compared to the time for the piston to\ntravel between top center positions. Because of the\nshort time and small clearance, the pressure drop in the 45\nspring chamber does not drop nearly as fast as the plenum pressure to maintain the poppet valve against the\npiston.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1 In a piston operating engine, a new and improved 50\n.\ngas charging valve arrangement comprising:\na cylinder containing a piston reciprocable within\nsaid cylinder between top center and bottom center\npositions, said cylinder having an upper transverse\nhead cap provided with an inlet port including a 55\nvalve seat disposed about the perimeter of said\nport;\na high pressure plenum chamber means disposed on\nthe side of said transverse head cap opposite the\npiston;\n60\nmeans adapted to supply high pressure gas to said\nplenum chamber means;\nfluid communication means including gas valve\nmeans movable between open and closed positions\nfor placing high pressure gas in said plenum cham- 65\nber in communication with said piston and cylinder\nwhen in the open position thereby inducing a pressure drop in said plenum chamber, said gas valve\n\n6\n\nmeans including a valve element having an upper\ncylindrical stem portion, a reduced diameter portion providing an annular shoulder means for sealingly engaging said valve seat when the gas valve\nmeans is in the closed position, and a lower pedestal portion engageable by said piston when at and\nnear its top center position whereby said valve\nelement is lifted by said piston from the valve seat\nto place said gas valve means in the open position;\npneumatic gas chamber means disposed on the side of\nsaid transverse head cap which is opposite the\npiston, said pneumatic gas chamber means including an upper pneumatic spring body member having a blind bore opening downwardly and a juxtaposed lower valve body member having a guide\nbore aligned and communicating with said blind\nbore, said guide bore receiving said cylindrical\nstem portion of the valve element for sliding movement therein;\na restricted flow passage for communicating high\npressure gas between said plenum chamber means\nand said pneumatic gas chamber means whereby\ngas pressure in the pneumatic gas chamber means\nacts on the valve element in opposition to the force\nexerted on the valve element by said piston,\nsaid flow passage being of sufficiently small dimension to restrict the flow of gas therefrom upon the\nopening of said gas valve means such that the pressure in said pneumatic gas chamber means drops at\na slower rate than the pressure in said plenum\nchamber on opening of said gas valve means so as\nto temporarily exceed the plenum chamber pressure for the period when the valve element is\nmoved to open position and at the time the valve\nelement is moved to closed position and the pneumatic gas chamber means thereby acts as a pneumatic spring retaining said valve element in constant contact with said piston and tracking the\nmovement of the piston throughout said period.\n2 The engine as defined in claim 1 wherein said blind\n.\nbore in said upper pneumatic spring body member is of\nlarger diameter than said guide bore to thereby provide\nan internal downwardly facing shoulder means, said\nshoulder limiting the travel of said valve member\ntowards the open position.\n3 The engine as defined in claim 1 wherein said gas\n.\nvalve means includes a depression in the end surface of\nsaid lower pedestal portion of the gas valve element\nwith a sealing surface disposed about said depression,\nsaid sealing surface being sealingly engageable with the\ntop surface of said piston when contacted by said piston\nwhereby a pressure differential is established by lower\npressure trapped in said depression which acts to retain\nthe valve element on the piston surface during the period of downward travel of the piston and valve element.\n4.
