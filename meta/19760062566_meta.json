The theory is supplemented with examples which portray very long baseline interferometry as a measuring system that will provide estimates of vertical crustal motion which are radically improved in comparison with those obtained from analysis of  repeated geodetic levelings. The example of the San Fernando earthquake of 1971 is used to show how much estimates of orthometric and geometric height change might differ. A comment by another author is appended which takes issue with some of the conclusions of this paper. In particular, an attempt is made in the comment to rebut the conclusion that geodetic leveling is less reliable than VLBI measurements for determining relative elevation change of points separated by more than 56 km.", "title": "New vertical geodesy", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T16:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760062566, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Whitcomb, J.
