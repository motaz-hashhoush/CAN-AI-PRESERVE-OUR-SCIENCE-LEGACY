Conventional seals have used fluid pressure to achieve\nmore effective sealing but have been useful for sealing\nunder static conditions only. Single seals for operation under both static and dynamic conditions have\nused a sliding seal between the valve housing outlet\nand ported ball. This consists of an 0 ring adapted to\nseal between the valve housing and a support member,\na sealing ring attached to an extremity of the support\nmember, and a spring to load the sealing ring against\nthe ported ball. Under loading, this seal suffers an efflctive pressure limit related to the spring tensile\nstrength.\n\nThe solution: A line-pressure responsive doubleacting seal in which the top of' the seal engages the\nported ball at the outer circumferential edge of the seal\nupper end and the bottom of the seal seats on a flat\ncircular land with a continuous wall, similar to a counterbore.\nHow it's done: The seal consists of plastic upper\nand lower rings bonded to the opposing lips of an inwardly projecting fold of metal. This fold of metal\nserves two purposes: it forms an annular passage for\nfree flow of fluid when the ball valve is in the port\nopen position: and it acts as a spring to keep the seal\nsurfaces in intimate contact with the ball and body\n(cortlirrued overleal)\n\ngo\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

In the port closed\nposition, as pressure increases, the ball compresses the\nseal against the land and the soft plastic faces of the\nseal fill any irregularities in either ball or land. As\npressure drops, in the port closed position, the fold of\nmetal acts as a spring and maintains the plastic rings\nin intimate contact with ball and land. In the port\nopen position, the fold of metal acts continuously as a\nspring to maintain the plastic rings in intimate contact\nwith ball and land. In this position, the tension exerted\nby the fold of metal on the plastic rings is directly proportional to the pressure of the fluid acting upon it. As\nthe fluid pressure increases, the metal fold is forced\noutward and exerts bidirectional force upward and\ndownward against the ball-engaging and land-engaging plastic rings, respectively.\n\nBrief 65-10327\t\n\nMovement of the ported ball is by means of a\nkeyed shaft through its center operated manually or\nby suitable mechanical arrangement.\nNote: This seal would be useful wherever fluids\nunder varying pressures are to be transferred in random quantities.\nPatent status: Title to this invention has been\nwaived under the provisions of the National Aeronautics and Space Act (42 U.S.C. 2457 (f)), to the\nNorth American Aviation, Inc., 1700 East Imperial\nHighway, El Segundo, California, 90246.\nSource: H.
