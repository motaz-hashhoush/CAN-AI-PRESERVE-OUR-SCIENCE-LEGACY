b'C\n\nan you imagine a coating that with a paper-thin\nlayer, protects your property from structural fire\ndamage from the ground up? Wessex Incorporated\nhas recently taken a technology that was originally developed\nfor NASA as a protective coating for ceramic materials used in\nheatshields for space vehicles, and modified it for use in\napplications such as building materials, machinery, and\ntransportation. The technology was developed at NASA Ames\nResearch Center as a protective coating for flexible ceramic\ncomposites (PCC). Wessex, of Blacksburg, Virginia, obtained\na license for the PCC and is proceeding to further develop it\nfor numerous applications. Wessex describes this innovative\ntechnology as, \xe2\x80\x9ca significant advancement in thermal\nprotection for the aerospace industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NASA-developed material is environmentally safe,\nwater-based, and contains no solvents. Many other flameretardant materials contain petroleum-based components,\nwhich can produce toxic smoke under flame. The ceramic\ncomponents of PCC do not produce any type of toxic fumes\nduring exposure to elevated temperatures.\nAn emissivity agent is attributed to PCC\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable\nthermal properties. Emissivity is the relative power of a\nsurface to emit heat by radiation. This principle, along with\nPCC\xe2\x80\x99s non-combustible material makeup, is what increases\nthe temperature capability of underlying insulation from high\ntemperatures. Because the emissivity of the PCC helps radiate\nthermal energy at the surface, it reduces heat transfer to the\nunderlying material. The coating essentially reduces the\nlikelihood of the underlying material becoming so hot that it\n\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nPaper-Thin Coating Offers Maximum Protection\ncombusts and thus inhibits the \xe2\x80\x9cflashover\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon\nfrom occurring.\nWessex versions of PCC can be used to shield ceramics,\nwood, plasterboard, steel, plastics, fiberglass, and other\nmaterials from catastrophic fires. They are extraordinarily\ntough and exhibit excellent resistance to thermal shock,\nvibration, abrasion, and mechanical damage. One thin layer\nof coating provides necessary protection and allows for\nflexibility while avoiding excessive weight disadvantages.\nWessex sold the PCC product to Danser, Inc., of\nParkersburg, West Virginia, a producer of ceramic-lined\ncommercial ductwork. Sales have also been made to\nEncapsulation Technologies, a manufacturer who is applying\nPCC to venetian blinds to make them more fire-resistant.\nPotentially, the PCC material can be used in the home, in the\ngarage area, where many volatile chemicals are often stored, in\nthe kitchen to prevent cooking and appliance fires, as a lining\nto prevent chimney fires, and also as a firewall between the\ngarage and the house. PCC applications could be beneficial in\nautomobiles, trucks, boats, aircraft, storage facilities, and\nhigh-rise facilities, as well.\nWessex has developed several other coatings for substrates\nsuch as woods and metals, and is currently working with a\nplastic manufacturer to use PCC on fiberglass doors.\nCurrently, fiberglass doors are extremely flammable and\nproduce noxious smoke in the event of a fire. Fiberglass doors\ntreated with PCC could be a low-cost, lightweight alternative\nto the expensive, heavy steel fire doors currently available in\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s market. \xe2\x9d\x96\n\nTwo silicon-dioxide-based\nceramic tiles were tested using\nan oxy-acetylene torch\n(hot enough to cut metals).\nThe untreated tile on the left\nmelted and turned to glass\nbeads within 30 seconds.\nUnder the same conditions,\nthe tile on the right with\nWessex\xe2\x80\x99s PCC coating, was\ntested for 2 minutes and\nshowed little damage.\n\nNASA SPINOFF \xe2\x9e\xa4 2001\n\nINDUSTRIAL PRODUCTIVITY/MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY\n\n109\n\n'
