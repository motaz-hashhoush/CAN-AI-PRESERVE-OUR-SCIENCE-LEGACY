The algorithm is based on a region growing approach and uses edge elements and edge element orientation to define the limits of the surface features. Adjacent regions which are not separated by edges are linked to form larger regions. Some of the advantages of scene segmentation over conventional TM image extraction algorithms are discussed, including surface feature analysis on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and faster identification of the pixels in each region. A detailed flow diagram of region growing algorithm is provided.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19850056681, "endDate": "1984-06-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Machine processing of remotely sensed data: Thematic Mapper data and geographic information systems", "location": "West Lafayette, IN", "id": "3be23bea933044578c75ad33a142c6dc", "startDate": "1984-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850056681, "id": "6512b6e280cc46b0ae44d1cf9a36b525", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
