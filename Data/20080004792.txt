The flexible laminate\nmandrel is comprised of sheets stacked to produce the\nrequired configuration, a cover wrap that applies pressure to the mandrel laminate, maintaining the stack\ncross-section. Then after use, the mandrels can be removed, disassembled, and reused. In the method of\nextracting the flexible mandrel from one end of a composite stiffener, individual ones of the laminae of the\nflexible mandrel or all are extracted at the same time,\ndepending on severity of the contour.\n2 Claims, 3 Drawing Sheets\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nFeb. 7, 1995\n\nSheet 1 of 3\n\n5,387,098\n\nU S , Patent\n\nFeb. 7, 1995\n\nSheet 2 of 3\n\n5,387,098\n\nU.S. Patent\n\nFeb. 7, 1995\n\nSheet 3 of 3\n\n7\n0\n\n5,387,098\n\n1\n\n5,387,098\n\n2\n\nmandrel for eliminating shift of the laminate stack in the\nFLEXIBLE REUSABLE MANDRELS\ntransverse direction;\nFIGS. 3A and 3B are side views in varying bent\nThe invention described herein was made in the perconditions illustrative of flexibility of the mandrel of\nformance of work under NASA Contract No. NAS1- 5 FIGS. 1A and 2 showing laminates with pins in slots\nand outer casing; and\n18889 and is subject to the provisions of 0 305 of the\nFIG. 4A is a side view, and FIG. 4B is an end view,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 as\nof the fabrication of a stiffened structure utilizing manamended (42 U.S.C. 2457).\ndrels according to the present invention.\n10\nFIELD OF INVENTION\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThe present invention relates to mandrels used in\nTurning now to FIG. 1A and FIG. lB, it can be seen\nassembly or curing of materials, and more particularly\nthat the present mandrel utilizes a plurality of layers of\nto a flexible reusable mandrel.\nlaminates 10 stacked and machined to the desired crossBACKGROUND ART\n15 sectional shape.
