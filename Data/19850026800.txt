Only initial\nstage of mixing between the solar core and solar outer layers after the\nsunspot maximun in the solar activity cycle can explain the higher(run\nnumber 27 and 71 )of solar neutrino data in Davis experiment. But solar\nflare induced atmospheric neutrino flux may have effect in the nucleon\ndecs_ detector on the undergrolmd.The neutrino flux from solar cosmic\nrs_s ms_ be a _seful guide to understand the background of nucleon decay,\nmagnetic monopole search, and the detection of neutrino flux in sea water\nexperimentSheldon( 1)indicated that the solar flares and solar active regions are\nenergetic disturbances in the sun and may be associated with the production of neutrinos.The emission of particles from flares and active regions is well known phenomena. Thus any such relation between solar neutrino data and solar cosnic rays is important and may serve as an accurate\nlong range predictor of solar cosmic ray activ\'\xc2\xb1ty properly._ecently Lanzerotti and Raghavan(2) and Raychaudhuri(3)suggested that the productign\nof solar neutrinos by energetic particles involved in solar actvity is\nnot a significant contributor to the solar neutrino flux recorded in the\nSN experiment(%) .Again Raychaudhuri(5)_ointed out that the neutrino flux\nwhich appears in the SN experiment canS_n no way connected with the sol_\nar surface nuclear reactions as the temperature and density are not suitable for such a rate of neutrino flux observed in the run numbers 27\nand 71._ know that the energy release in solar particle fle_es where\nrelativistic _otons\n\no\'-1o\n\ncan be accelerated are seen typically\n\nin the energy\n\n5\n\no\n0\nC_\nproJ ct d on to tb solar surface $ubramanian(6)and Bazilev\nskaya et al(7)sug_ested that the neutrino emission process underlying\nthe flare mechanism may contribute to the hi_her SN flux as obser_d in\nDavis experiment.Recently _zilevskaya\net al(8) and _asu(9) have found\n_hat there is a significant relationship between SN data and solar particles-lt is true that the ge_agnetic\nindex A_ is t_e index of solar\nparticles but x_tmay not have any connection with the SN flux.As mentioned earlier(3) that the surface nuclear reaction which may occur during\nlarge solar flare cannot account the flux obser_d in SN experiment.It \'\nis believed that the measurable fluxes of neutrinos could not be producmd by solar flare particles interactin_ in the earth\'s atmosphere(10).\nA_ne possible mechanism\nthat may explain incresed _WAr production from\n\xe2\x80\xa2flares and cosmic raF_ intensity ie that the particles wi_h energy mostelYreleSsthan 1 (_v) produ_e_ s_&tion\nproducts in the earth atmosph(\'s0 ,i_N\n_B\netc ).The expected yield from _-0\n,i3N\n, SB\n(wh_cha --A\ndecays into neutrino with ener_v._\xc2\xb0\n_reater than I Mev_are, le ss than\n----|\n.\n\xc2\xb0\n10\nc_ sec -Although $ B decays into high energy neutrlno upto 14 F_v\n\n443\nSH 8. 1-8\nbut it cannot contribute an appreciable fraction in the SN data of Davis\net al.(4).Thus the question remains whether the cosmic ray mumus,pions\nand kaons at the time of large solar flare san produce detectable flux\nof neutrinos in the Davis experiment.Weknow that (11)in the biggest\nsolar flare which occurs in August 1972 produced proton flux 5.5x _\'_\nabove .100 Mev in about 5 minutes and thus we cannot expect to have neutrino flux as high as 5xi06 _ar\'2-se\xc2\xa2 frcml pionspkaons and muons produ"1\nced hy relativistic protons through cascades in the earthls atmos_eree\nThus frum our present knowledge_\nwe cannot expect that the solar flare\ncan effect the production of _Ar in the Davis experiment..We\npresent\nbelow the solar cosmic ray event(12,13)which produces intense X-ray,_ray etc.)with the correspondingrun in Davis experiment in Table I to\nsee whether solar flare can contribute a_ detectable perturbation in\nthe recorded _ flux.\n\nTable\nI\nin SN experi\nment\n..........\n19\n21\n\nz7\n30\n32\n36\n42\n\nray event eonno in S_ experi\ncte_ with flare\naent\nere)\n2J_ 1.71 "\n67\n1.9"71\n/+.8.72_\n\n7.8.721\n29.4.?3\n7.7.74\n23.9.74\n30.4.76\n\n68\n69\n\nevent connected\nwith flare etc.\n25. 11"80\n24.12-80\n1.4-811\n\n414.8q,\n10 4.81_\n27.4"81 "_\n3o.4.81_\n10.5.81[\n\ne\'9.\n9"7zJ\n\n6.\n5.81\n7. .81 [\n\'71\n\n52\n\n22.11"77\n\n53\n\n29.4.78\n\n55\n\n23,9.78\n\n60\n6_\n66\n\n21.8 7c)J\n7.6.80\n6-11\xe2\x80\xa280\n,,,,\n\n"\n\n12.10.81J\n\n75\n\n12.7.82\n26-11,82\n18 12 82,)\n16elSe\n\n84\n\n25.%.8/+\ni\n\n..\n\n.,\n\n,\n\n.,\n\ni\n\nJ\n\nIt is interesting to analyze the possible temporal fluctuation of SN\nflux with solar commic ray variation.If we see the data of fig.l(14)\nwe see that the run n_bers 21,27,29,31,36,39,_2,47,49,51,52,54,56,58,\n6$_71 gives the highergFAr production than the aver_Ar\nprod_io_\nrate.The run numbers 36-_ belong to the sunspot minimum range(5).\nAccording to Bazilevskaya et al (15)only solar cosmic ray events conr_\nected with the run numbers 21,27_51_71 can increase the production\nrate o_Ar\nin the SN experiment.But2 solar cosmic ray e_nts(comnacted with run numbers 21 and 51) took place on invisible side of the\nsun and therefore the increases of3}Ar production will be absent.Raychaudhuri(16_17,5)showedthat the 8N data _aries with 11 year solar\ncycle.He also explained why the SN flux is increased frum 1975 to\n1978.1t is clear from the data(8,15) that th_ce is a correlation\nbetween the galactic cosmic rays and the SN data and all of them vary\nwith the _ year solar cycle.Raychaudhuri(5,\n16_lrmadE explained the\n\n444\nSH 8. I-8\nincrase of SN data(in run n_bers\n27 and 71 ) due to large amount of 3 He\nis mixed periodically in the core after the sunspot maxim_n,Thus the Eargest solar flare and highest SN flux occurs _nchronousl_ and the solar\nflare has no direct connection with the SN flux._m\nIf the solar cosmic\nr_y event has some effect on the SN flux we could have observed it from\nother solar flare event_.g, run number 55_since the proton fluence greater than 10 _ev and 30 Mev in run numbers 55,71 are almost the same(18)_\nbut it did not happen. The solar flare event cannot explain the higher\ncounts in run numbers 27 and 71 in Davis experiment but it may have\neffect in the nucleon deca_ detector and also on the neutrino experimen%\nin the accelerator etc-Thus the solar flare has no direct connection with\n\nthe S_ flux(5).\nProtein deck:- Accurate calculation\nof low energy neutrino fluxes ( _I Gev )is meeeesary for the evaluation of the nucleon decay backgrotmd.\nGaisser et al(19 )calculated the atmospheric neutrino flux by taking into\naccount the effects of solar modulation that they did not consider the\natmospheric neutrino flux from solar cosmic ray events.They consider only\nthat the cosmic ray _lux is higher at solar minimum and lower at solar\nmaxima. But it was indicated by Kodama(20)that the unusual increases in\ncosmic rays and fast type PGA events occur only during the ascending(for\nabout 2 years before sunspot maxim_ year) and descendi_ phases(for\nabout 2-4 yearei_fter sunspot maximum year_f\nthe solar _ycle avoiding _\nthe sunspot maximum year-The neutrinos are generated in the earth atmosphere by solar protons but because of the diffusion mechanism of protons\nmoving between the sun and earth the whole process is very prolonged in\ntime and difficult to identify against the background of an ordinary atmospheric flttx.\'_k\nhave gathered from table I of King(t1) that in August 1972\nbiggest solar flare events produces fl_x of protons above 200 _v constitute 83% of the fluxes obtained by integrating over the entire solar cycle.\nThe biggest solar flare which occured in October 1981 is almost the same\nas powerful as the August 19_72flare.The fluence of proton of 100 _v--1\nCev constitute above 6.6xi0 \xc2\xa5 um_z \xe2\x80\xa2We know fluxes of neutrinos around 1\nGev are 3.93x 10_ am -_ sec"I sterad-\' in vertical direction and 6._0x\n10"mom -_ sec -L sterad -I in horizontal direction at ground level from\ngalactic cosmic rays.Again we know that _he fluxes of protons around I\nCev are 10 cm -_- sec "-f sterad -m from the best estimates of galactic\n-I\nco_ic rays as we have taken the fluxes pf protons at the time of low\nsolar activity.Thus we ca_\nexpect the ratio between the neutrino fltLx\na_ proton flux is within _5 and 3/5 aruund 1 Ge_FXom October 1981 to\nJuly3982\nthe average fluence of proton greater than 100 F_v constitutes\n5xi0\ncm\n(roughly) Let us take that the solar flares lasted in such a\nway which produces significant fluxes of neutrinos.We get the neutrino\nflux is about 1.8 c_ -_ sec-I sterad-_ and which is about 30 to 3_ times\nhigher than the cosmic ray neutrino flux around 300_ _V to 500 Mev. _ais\nsupports also that the 100 F_v to 1 O_v solar proton flux is atleast an\norder of magnitude higher than the galactic proton fluxe_._re\nalthough\nneutrino energy is lower than I Gev but the fluences are higher so it is\npossible that the atmospheric neutrinos frem solar cosmic ray affect the\nunderground experiment on nucleon deck. Similarly rouen fluxes from solar\ncosmic rays _\nalso be an order higher than the rouen fluxes from galactic cosmic rays in the region from 100 Mev to 1 _ev.As the experiments of\n_GF_Mant H[anc,l_Kamiokande_Soudan\nI were operated within the range of\nbigger eolar cosmic ray event we suspect that all the nucleon decay events\nobserved _j them are due to atmospheric neutrinos from solar cosmic ray\nJ\n\n445\n\ns_ 8.1.43\nin t_e large scale experiments conducted at great depths _nderground\nsince 1965 KGF group(21)recorded several ancaalous events some of which\nare suggestive of decay of new particles or sc_e of nucleon decay.From\nthe above _\nanalTsis we suggest that previous events was also\nperhaps due to theat_ospherie neutrinos produced from solar cosmic r_\neve_ts.So to decide about the nucleon deck7 properly we need better estimate of neutrino flux frum solar cosmic ray events,At present we do not\nhave better estimate o_ solar cosmic ray proton flux from the 21st solar\nc_cle.So it is necessary to know the better knowledge ef solar proton\nfluxes aroumd Gev.We hope to calculate the neutrino flux from solar cosmic raOr event when the full data of solar proton fluxes\nwill be available\nupto 1985 for the 21st solar cycle from space missions.The solar cosmic\nray neutrino flux will be an important step a_d guide(i)to understand the\nbaekgrow_d for nucleon decay research from a_mospheric\nneutrinos\nand also\n(ii)_o the neutrino experiment which is operated on the undersroundmsea\nwater and acceleratoz_\nReferenoes:1) _R*,qheldon(1969 )Nature _\n650\n2)L.JLan2mrottiT. and R._Rag_avan(1981)Nature\n\n\xc2\xb0_\n293.1P._,.\n\nO\n\n\'\n\n3)P.\n(1983)z.a.
