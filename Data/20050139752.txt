ST-5 will consist\nof a constellation of three micro-satellites, each of mass\napproximately 25 kg and size approximately 60 cm by\n30 cm. The mission goals are to design, develop and\nflight-validate three capable micro-satellites with new\ntechnologies; to demonstrate the ability to do researchquality science with the ST-5 spacecraft; and to operate\nthe three spacecraft as a constellation.\nST-5 will launch in late February/early March 2006 on\na Pegasus XL launch vehicle. The orbits for the three\nspacecraft are elliptical polar sun-synchronous (105.6\ndeg inclination), with 300km x 4500km altitude. The\nconstellation will have all three spacecraft flying in the\nsame orbit plane, with the second spacecraft trailing the\nfirst (and the third trailing the second) by some tens of\nkilometers, a configuration known as \xe2\x80\x9cstring of pearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe planned mission duration is three months.\n\nST-5 had been originally designed to fly as a secondary\npayload on an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle\n(EELV, e.g. an Atlas or Delta booster) to an equatorial\nGeosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO). However, no\nsecondary ride opportunities became available for the\nST-5 timeframe. In early 2004 the mission was replanned for a Pegasus XL dedicated launch into our\nelliptical polar orbit. The re-plan allows the mission to\nachieve the same high-level validation objectives with a\ndedicated launch vehicle. The new mission design\ninvolves a different orbit and different communication\nstrategy, while minimizing changes to the ST-5\nspacecraft itself. Some new hardware (known as the\nPegasus Support Structure: or PSS) was required to\nWebb\n\n1\n\n2\n\n25-KG MICRO-SPACECRAFT\n\n2.1\nSpacecrajl Bus\nThe ST-5 spacecraft was designed to be a generalpurpose spacecraft for science constellation missions.\nST-5\xe2\x80\x99s bus is developed in-house at Goddard Space\nFlight Center. The bus structure is octagonal, with\nbody-mounted solar arrays. The top and bottom decks\nare machined aluminum, a central cast aluminum \xe2\x80\x9ccard\ncage\xe2\x80\x9d houses the Command and Data Handling and\nPower System Electronics cards, and formed aluminum\nsheet side panels close out the structure and support the\nsolar arrays. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized, with a\npassive nutation damper. The spacecraft thermal\nsystem is also completely passive. In order to reduce\ninterference with the on-board magnetometer, strict\nmagnetic cleanliness requirements were imposed on the\nspacecraft design. This involved careful selection of\nparts and materials, magnetic shielding of the battery,\nand careful wiring of certain components such as the\nsolar arrays to minimize open current loop area.\nA deployment mechanism releases each spacecraft from\nthe GSFC-developed Pegasus Support Structure (F\xe2\x80\x98SS)\nmounted to the Pegasus XL launch vehicle. The\ndeployer imparts an initial spin rate and linear velocity\nto each spacecraft, resulting in a spacecraft angular rate\nof approximately 20 RPM after the magnetometer\nboom is deployed. The PSS and spacecraft deployment\nmechanism were developed in-house at GSFC.\n\nGOMACtech 2005\n\n22\n.\nSpacecrap Technologies\nST-5's enabling technologies make it possible to build a\nspacecraft that achieves ST-S's weight and size goals,\nwhile providing the capabilities that make it possible\nfor the mission to achieve its science validation goals.\n\ncommunications between components on the spacecraft\nas well as space-to-ground. The C&DH is a single\ndouble-sided board that consumes less than 4W of\npower. Its major components are a 12 hIHz Mongoose\nV processor, two on-board Electrically Erasable\nProgrammable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) chips,\n\nXSand Antenna\n(in radome; top\n\nti-Ion Battery\n(hidden under top\n\nA\n~\n\nTriple Junction\n\nSolar Cells\n\n' Magw\n\n1\n\nDepla\nBa\n\nSubsystem\n(including\ntank and\nmicro-\n\nI\n\nlaster Control\n\nElectronics,\nsure Transducer\nElectronics\n\nFigure 1 - ST-5 Exploded View\nST-5's technology components include a single-card\nCommand and Data Handling (C&DH) computer\nfeaturing 0.5 V Complementary Metal Oxide\nSemiconductor (CMOS) Ultra Low Power Radiation\nTolerant (CULPRiT) logic; a low primary voltage\npower system featuring triple-junction solar cells and a\nlithium-ion battery; a miniature communications system\nfeaturing an X-band transponder and an evolved\nantenna developed using a genetic algorithm; a passive\nnutation damper; a cold gas propulsion system using a\nsingle micro-thruster for both delta-V and attitude\ncontrol; a miniature magnetometer; a digital miniature\nspinning sun sensor; and the Variable Emittance\nCoating (VEC) thermal surfaces. Figure 1 is an\nexploded view of the ST-5 spacecraft showing the\ntechnologies.\nST-5's C&DH provides the sophisticated command and\ndata handling functionality found on larger spacecraft?\nbut in a smaller package.\nit coordinates all\n\n20 MBbyte of Dynamic Random Access Memory\n(DRAM), and three Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGA). Laying out this densely populated board was\na significant design challenge, but was essential to the\ndesign of ST-5 as a highly capable smallsat. The\nC&DH was developed in-house at Goddard.\nIncorporated into the ST-5 C&DH, CULPRiT logic was\ndeveloped to operate at low voltage (0.5V supply\nvoltage), while being radiation tolerant. For ST-5,\nCULPRiT technology is being used to implement a\nReed-Solomon encoder. Future space missions may be\nable to benefit from reductions in overall electronics\npower dissipation of one to two orders of magnitude\nwith widespread use of CULPRiT. The Center for\nAdvanced Microelectronics and Biomolecular Research\nat the University of Idaho, AMI Semiconductor, and\nPicoDyne were involved in the development of this\ntechnology.\n\nThe low voltage power system helps ST-5 achieve its\nsize and weight requirements. A triple-junction solar\narray, composed of 8 body-mounted panels, provides\napproximately 20-25W of power at approximately 9i Vv\xe2\x80\x99. Lithium Ion batteries provide energy srorage of 79 Ah at 6-8V. Both solar array and battery are\ncontrolled by a single Power System Electronics (PSE)\nboard. In addition to providing power to all spacecraft\ncomponents, the power system provides contingency\nrecovery for over-current, over-voltage, and low battery\ncharge conditions. The nominal unregulated spacecraft\nprimary bus voltage is 8.4V maximum, and (as the\nbattery state of charge decreases) can range down to\n6.5V before automatic load-shedding occurs. The PSE\nsupplies both the unregulated primary bus and regulated\n5V services to the various onboard subsystems. The\nsolar array was developed by Emcore, the battery by\nAEA Technology Space, and the PSE in-house at\nGoddard.\n\n90%) since there is no matching network required. In\naddition the evolved antenna is very simple, with\nradiator soldered directly to the connector and a plain\naluminum ground plane instead of the microstrip\nprinted circuit board and coilection of passive\ncomponents required for the QFH matching network.\nBoth antenna designs (QFH and evolved) have nearomni coverage, and are coupled equally to the diplexer.\nOne antenna is mounted on each deck (top and bottom)\nof the ST-5 spacecraft\nA passive damper controls any nutation of the spin axis\nthat might occur due to initial deployment, on-orbit\nmaneuvers, or dynamic imbalance. The damper is a\nwelded titanium unit without a bellows, fully filled with\nsilicone fluid at a maximum design pressure of 10,000\npsi. The nutation damper was developed in-house by\nGSFC.\nA single cold-gas micro-thruster provides all ST-5 orbit\n\nST-5 communicates with ground stations via an X-band\nuplink at 1 kbps and downlink at 1 Kbps, 100 kbps, and\n200 kbps. One of the new technology components is a\nminiature transponder that offers a substantial decrease\nin weight, power, and volume over current operational\nsystems. The transmit scheme uses Binary Phase Shift\nKeying (BPSK) encoding and no subcarrier to\nmaximize efficiency. The Consultative Committee for\nSpace Data Systems (CCSDS) recommendations have\nbeen amended to incorporate this scheme. The\ntransponder is used in conjunction with a high power\namplifier, diplexer, band pass filter and two X-band\nantennas. The communications system is compatible\nwith the Deep Space Network, the NASA Ground\nNetwork station at McMurdo in the Antarctic, or small\naperture off-the-shelf antennas. The transponder and\nhigh power amplifier were developed by AeroAstro.\nTwo different types of antennas are being developed for\nST-5: a quadrifilar helix (QFH) antenna developed by\nNew Mexico State University (NMSU), and an\n\xe2\x80\x9cevolved\xe2\x80\x9d antenna designed with genetic algorithms\ndeveloped by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames Research Center and E M\nEngineering in partnership with NMSU. The radiator\nfor the evolved antenna was designed by a computer\nprogram using what is known as a genetic algorithm.\nUsing language borrowed from genetics the algorithm\nis a \xe2\x80\x9cgenotype\xe2\x80\x9d that designs a wire form radiator based\non a fitness function optimizing Voltage Standing\nWave Ratio (VSWR) and gain over the angles of\ninterest. The end result \xe2\x80\x9cphenotype\xe2\x80\x9d is lightweight,\noptimized for the application, and looks rather like a\nsmall tree made from a bent paper clip. The big\nadvantage of the evolved antenna for ST-5 is its higher\nand more uniform gain across a wider range of\nelevation angles and its extremely high efficiency (>\n\nand attitude maneuver capability. The propulsion\nsystem also includes a lightweight composite tank, a\nfill-and-drain valve, an in-line filter and a pressure\ntransducer. Thruster Control Electronics (TCE) and\nPressure Transducer Electronics (PTE) are used to\ncontrol the system. Hardware safeguards ensure that\nthe latching thruster valve cannot be opened unless\nthere is sufficient energy stored in the TCE to close the\nvalve. The TCE and PTE were developed in-house by\nGoddard; the micro-thruster was developed by Marotta\nScientific Controls, and the composite tank was\ndeveloped by Carleton Technologies.\nThe ST-5 science validation instrument is a miniature\nflwgate magnetometer, which produces high resolution\nthree-axis magnetic measurements. The magnetometer\nsensor head is mounted at the end of a deployed lowmass boom constructed of graphite composite tube\nsectiocs wit5 beryllium-copper \xe2\x80\x9ccarpenter tape\xe2\x80\x9d hinges.\nST-5\xe2\x80\x99s magnetometer was designed and built by the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). The\nboom was developed in-house at Goddard.\nA digital-output miniature spinning sun sensor (MSSS)\nis used to measure the elevation angle of the sun with\nrespect to the ST-5 spin axis. The spacecraft is capable\nof autonomously repositioning itself to within 10\ndegrees of the sun line to ensure adequate sunlight on\nthe solar arrays. The MSSS was developed for ST-5 by\nAdcole.\nThe VECs are radiators with switchable emittance\nstates to vary the amount of heat that they radiate to\nspace. Future space missions may be able to efficiently\nadapt to wide ranging thermal conditions with radiators\nbased on these technologies. The Micro Electro-\n\nMechanical Systems (MEMS) VEC consists of multilayered silicon shutters that open and close to vary their\nemittance. The Electro-Static Radiator (ESR) is a\nthermal control film that varies its radiation by\nswitching heat transfer mechanisms between t w o plates\ninternally by the use of an electrostatic field. When the\nplates are in contact, the mechanism between them is\nconduction and the ESR is in a high-emittance state;\nwhen the plates are separated, the mechanism is\nradiation between them and the ESR is in a low\nemittance state. ST-5 can accommodate two VECs per\nspacecraft-one each on the top and bottom decks.\nDue to the technology development schedule, ESR\nVECs will be flown on the second and third spacecraft,\nand MEMS VEC on the third spacecraft only. The\nMEMS VEC is developed by the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL),\nusing shutters provided by Sandia National\nLaboratories. The Electro-Static Radiator (ESR) is\ndeveloped by Sensortex, with control electronics from\nJHU-APL.\n\ncantilevered from the circular Pegasus XL mounting\ninterface. The ST-5 deployment mechanisms are\nmounted to the PSS so that the ST-5 spacecraft are\nejected normal to the longitudmal axis of the Pegasus.\n'Fhe spacecraft are deployed sequentially approximately\n200 seconds apart after Pegasus third stage burnout.\nFigure 2 shows the three ST-5 spacecraft in launch\nconfiguration on the PSS.\nSCIENCE DEMONSTRATION\nOne goal of the ST-5 mission is to demonstrate the\nability to do research-quality science with a\nmicrosatellite.\n4\n\nA primary application for NASA's constellation\nmissions is the in situ measurement of critical scalar\nand vector quantities over large volumes of space.\nExamples from the Earth's high altitude plasma\nenvironment include the determination of plasma flow\nfields and vorticity, the propagation characteristics of\nblast waves from solar flares, electric current density,\nmagnetic flux tube topology and the magnetic\nchanneling of solar wind energy into the upper\natmosphere.\n\nST-5 will validate the constellation measurement\nconcept by determining the vertical electric current\ndensity over the Earth's northern and southern auroral\nzones through the evaluation of the curl of the local\nmagnetic field. These electric currents have been\npreviously inferred to exist from single-spacecraft\nmeasurements, but quantitative knowledge of their\nintensity and spatial distribution is limited. ST-5 will\ndirectly measure many important spatial and temporal\ncharacteristics of the electric currents that power the\nstriking optical emissions from the auroral zones and\nheat the high latitude ionosphere.\nST-5's flight software is capable of detecting science\nevents of interest, i.e. when the rate of change of the\nambient magnetic field increases beyond a given\nthreshold. When this occurs, the spacecraft changes the\nscience data collection mode to a higher rate.\n\nPegasus\n:wrdinates\n\nFi,we 2 - ST-5 Spacecraft i PSS\nn\n3\n\nPEGASUS SUPPORT STRUCTURE AND\nDEPLOYMENT MECHANISMS\n\nThe ST-5 spacecraft are accommodated on the Pegasus\nXL vehicle via the GSFC-developed Pegasus Support\nStructure (PSS). The PSS is a bolted and riveted\naluminum sheet structure that forms a stiff backbone\nWebb\n\n4\n\nST-5 will be deployed into a string of pearls\nconstellation with all three spacecraft in the same orbit\nplane in the same nominal trajectory (described earlier).\nThe initial separation between the spacecraft will be on\nthe order of meters after deployment from the launch\nvehicle. The on-board propulsion system will be used\nto maneuver the spacecraft into two or three different\nspacings, to better study the auroral ovals. The first\nconstellation configuration of interest (to be achieved\napproximately two weeks into the mission) is\napproximately 25km between spacecraft 1 and 2, and\n-- 75km between spacecraft 2 and 3. A somewhat-@kEL\nGOMACtech 2005\nI\n_\n\nperigee is approximately 160 degrees, the orbit line of\napsides (and therefore the position of the apogee over\nthe Earth) precesses approximately 1.2 degrees per day\ninto the southern hemisphere. Thus, DSN\xe2\x80\x99s Canberra\nground station or the NASA Ground Network\nMcMurdo ground station is best suited to ST-5\ncommunications since the longest passes will occur\nnearest those stations during our three month mission.\n\nspacing (-5Okm and 1OOkm) is planned for later in the\nmission (approximately 8 weeks after launch), and a\nthird configuration may be planned near the end of the\nthree month mission. The final separations may be\nbased on the results obtained from early magnetic\nmeasurements.\n5\nCONSTELLATION OPERATIONS\nThe three ST-5 spacecraft will be operated as a\nconstellation by coordinating maneuvers and the\nconstellation configuration to enable the mission\nscience validation demonstration. The spacecraft and\nground system provide evolvable steps along the road\nto future constellation missions.\n\nCONTRIBUTION TO FUTURE SCIENCE\nMISSIONS\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Sun-Earth Connection science theme in the\nScience Mission Directorate has the goal of\nunderstanding how solar activity affects the\ninterplanetary medium, the magnetosphere, the\nionosphere, and the upper atmosphere of the Earth. In\norder to better understand this science, NASA plans\nconstellation missions of small Spacecraft to collect\ndata at various points in space. As an example, the\nMagnetospheric Constellation Mission is planned to\ndeploy 30-40 small spacecraft in the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetosphere.\n6\n\nGoddard has developed a GSFC Mission Services\nEvolution Center (GMSEC) architecture to allow \xe2\x80\x9cplug\nand play\xe2\x80\x9d of ground system components.
